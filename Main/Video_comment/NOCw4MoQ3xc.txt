I'm a HOG because I believe in seeding.   Ask Tom. Not me.  What's Seeding Tom... Thomas.
I'm still listening
I am 12 and I enjoy this music this proves this generation isn't completely Dead
31 Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice: HOLY BIBLE
HOLY BIBLE----- 5 Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry: 6 for which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience: 7 In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them. 8 But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.
HOLY BIBLE------ 3 But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints; 4 neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks. 5 For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. 6 Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience. 7 Be not ye therefore partakers with them.
Some of the realist words I have heard
I have been feeling I need to read the Bible thru ..I have never been what many consider religious but I do believe. Just feel I am to ignootonit all to be with people so knowledgeable about it. So I have always expressed my faith in my own moments and in my own ways. With that said, I am commenting to ask, How do I know which Bible is for me? I know there is sooo many and each person will tell you something different m How do I know which Bible is for me?

The flag throughout the whole video is so dope. But the pattern on his  face from the side was definitely a helluva closer.

LA 2025...
One of my daughters friends actually said that she didn’t like you while she was in my house that I pay the mortgage for and I said well I’ve been to jail for slapping the shit out of my own daughter that standing next to you so if you wanna keep talking, I think you should probably just go sit in your car and listen to your fucking country music  and cry. not that I am against country music 🎶
Everybody must hear this song!! My fav song by him
Crazy beats
Would love to meet with you and discuss new ideas. You are awesome and I think you l your message is spot on. Give me a DM if you want any help.

Got that whole 90s grunge
Top 5 maybe 3
YESHUA lead me to your music, thank you YESHUA for Tom’s music and for rescuing him from Hell! Love you Tom
Finally we have more financial inequality and still no Epstein files. Tom makes nices tunes, but politically he is bat shit crazy. He hates his own country and poses as an American patriot.
Essas músicas  do Dax que falam da vida são boas!   Mas ele tem lançado uma atrás da outra, espero que ele esteja bem e que lance Rap com letras para explodir nossas mentes
Lost all respect for this guy once he got into politics and became a MAGA Moron. Bros Canadian, and he has no pride at all.
I know the president I'll  be name dropping until Brazil is no longer kicking shins

This is next level. End game right here. I actually thought this was about b I d e n at first. Lol😂 p.s. love your story to the top. All inspiring and let's face it--there's not enough of it. 👊
Why so quiet ❤🎉😂😮
2024 and 2025
I'd dig this track so much more without the autotune.
The fact that there are 17 year old Italian-American men listening to this makes me chuckle. God bless you, Tom.  Best rapper alive after Skee-Lo!!!
Blacks and whites can agree on one thing, we're all getting fucked by the government

I can understand why most people who like this guy are 50 year old white guys

HAPPY VETERANS DAY MY BELOVED JESUS AND VET FAMILY    I’m a vet and I don’t wanna regret..the country I served,  but you know it’s a shame when a Trident Commander takes the blame,  for a punk as bitch.. tryin’ to gundeck the BUDS game.    Or a cold play, when the NAVY puts on display,  a transgender to represent our mighty NAVY today.  And if you think Im lying go watch Shawn Ryan   Dax and Tom are doing the right thing  I hated rap until I saw these two legit rap kings  Unlike woke supporters rapping with MM  who’s into kids and SNM   TOM AND DAX come to the Cross because they know who’s Boss   And did you here, the Joker is dead   Dax and Tom have become soldiers instead  A major battle was won but the war from the woke can still get us smoked  A nations valor is no joke   My outy is for T&D,  I hope your freaked out with me Know that my game is not fame  You can use my cadences in any way if that doesn’t work  Just send me an NDA   ATTENTION ALL SAILORS SOLDIERS, AIRMAN, FIRST RESPONDERS FROM THE AMERICAS TO THE UK AND BEYOND   PLEASE  FALL IN AND SOUND OFF!  SUBSCRIBE AND HIT THE LIKE BUTTON FOR THE SONG “SOLDIER“  THESE DUDES ARE FIGHTING THE GOOD FIGHT FOR US BY GETTING OUR MESSAGE OUT!  TO THE LEFT RIGHT CLICK ON “SOLDIER” AND FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT!

Hey Tom, imagine Trump walking on stage with this playing all the way through at his Inauguration Ceremony. 🇺🇸
If you didn't get anymore money you would still be blessed? You should slash your prices then 😅😅😅😅
I'm a GreatGrandMawMaw & ❤ Tom. He spits out the truth without anyone owning him. 🙏🏼
Good job

I’m not going to exist just to be Gods punching bag
You’re bitter and pathetic for not letting my stuff post …. Reminds me of cersie below the belt 😇

That was better than Mac but the sad thing is I believe Tom has over 40 number 1 s. Just wondering how many you have?
❤
Something about you  This song came back on  I'll admit, I love this one
Not sure if this actually does anything. The system taught me not to think for myself, and Tom told me to do this, so here we are.
Tom is the best rapper out fuck the haters h.o.g fo life
He ain’t wrong!!!!!
Love this track!

Trump should use this for a campaign song. Because it's so true when Trump shows up everyone's excited. When Carmela shows up why so silent.
Not offended, bring it. Blessed Be my beautiful souls. All the healing energy I can muster coming at you. If you feel it, accept it ❤ breathe it in
Best ever
was this an ICP dog? 😅
Tom why do you Sensor your music
feel power!
❤❤❤
Love seeing Nova being featured in this fun catchy song!!  We need more from her!! Sometimes I forget she's in her early 30's....she could pass for 24!!
Love this song!!! So proud of Tom and Nova!!!
Tom killing it again. Love the energy 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Hel yeah..spitten straight
N nova is the best female artist in my book n in my eyes so fuck a hater
Listening since Tom came out n never will stop he's the best n always will b in my book fuck haters n nobody that dnt understand his music or his word n all
Holy **%% this song hits hard Tom! Why hasn’t this song been pushed into my recommendations?  Words can’t describe how great  this is!
Absolutely love this song. Tears flowing for the patriot that died the ones injured and Donald Trump. As hard as he looked putting his fist up and telling us fight fight fight, the fear on his face gets me every time. Tom MacDonald lead us into battle and we will follow!
Tom doesn’t take a political side he just wants this craziness to stop. Let’s be honest if Tom is voting this year we know who he’s voting for.
New video on Friday.🎉🎉
Havent had a song hype me this much since Ballad of a Dead Soulja......... This was tight, Hope the Alpine in the Mojave can handle it!!!!!
So good I love this song
This is a great song, with an awesome video
True fuckin shit bro keep up the gud work bro nobody understands us n all when we work n kill ourselves n all n tell nova im her fan to shes my crush would love to have her in my life to shes so hot

Love this feel so much better with life with a artist like you makes me motivated to do shit all by myself , love and respect bruh godspeed 🎉
Who's here from God Mode? 😂
Not gonna lie Tom you saved my life man. Before your music I was suicidal and then I heard a couple of your songs such as don’t look down, Names. There’s more I just want to thank you Tom I really do man I know you won’t respond or like or even see this but thank you for what you do HOG GANG FOR LIFE. All love man
The chirp would be way more funny if it was a smoke detector. Just sayin. Love Tom!
🎤👐🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Greatest rapper I've ever heard! Keep up the amazing work brother! People can't stand it when you say something that resonates with them, that they don't want to be true. It's not that they don't believe you, they just get defensive because it goes against the image of reality they want to exist. Truth is truth. I never take anything at face value. NOTHING! You're as real as it gets man, and your music is revolutionary.
The skeletons you're standing on....  is this a Griffith thing?  My mind goes to the Berserk anime.  Griffith had come so far because so many had died for him and fighting against him that he felt he had to continue or their deaths wouldn't mean anything.  Idk maybe I'm reading too much into it.  The pile of bones is creepy tho.
Badass song would love to know who hes talking to 😂
I think it’s so amazing Tom you have let a Real Legend From the 80 when u were a little man 8 🤠and now look at you! What do you have in common! Being a male, drama in ur dna. Now Music, making movies. Tom u had some beefs, u had some u know woooooooohoooesss and you made it! Focus on u learning everything, everything! So u are never without $$$$$$$$$$$. I can see u getting hirer ! Now your real destination is all aboard, train and loving instead of finding faults in all of us! You know like all u guys know is at your granny’s house! But damn look at me? 😝🥳🧐talk about being sure of myself, on streets and now. Sing me some more of your beautiful songs, dang Tomas amazing you are and so are the family and Nova… animation. Make the videos and voices your own baby talks😷🫢🙄went to far.👏👏👏🤑🤑🤑👏👏👏👏👏

Everyone forgets you can say whatever you want. The worst thing that can happen is some pussy will sue you over copyrights. Wayne has been on every one’s beat and ripped off a  lot of artists music but he’s still one of the goats. Tom your at the top 🐐
🔥🔥🔥🔥
That's a beautiful lyric.
Operator: 911, what’s your emergency? Me: Tom MacDonald. Operator: That’s a fire we cannot put out.
New to H.O.G. but I tell you this I'm hooked. Let's go Tom and Nova. Now let me go back to binge watching

Riot: One of my favorites from you! Songs on repeat constantly.
Hamas does not like the Palestinians - they use them as human shields - Hamas terror base is hidden beneath Gaza's largest hospital, Israel alleges-NOT SURE WHY some folks don't realize the Hamas use human shields for public support
INFLATION still destroying us - IF THEY WANTED inflation to drop to the manageable Trump levels they would stop all of this bloated and harmful spending and expanding the federal government - they don't care about us - we are inferior to them!!!!
INFLATION still destroying us - IF THEY WANTED inflation to drop to the manageable Trump levels they would stop all of this bloated and harmful spending and expanding the federal government - they don't care about us - we are inferior to them!!!!
They're losing their minds in Chicago - Chicago meeting turns ugly as residents protest planned migrant camp in local neighborhood: 'Nobody asked us'-DEMOCRATS ARE GIVING AWAY POLITICAL POINTS-Trump 2024!!!!!!!!!!
When are you going to tour?? Can’t wait to see you live!!
You are my favorite artist
❤❤
Love this song/video. Found Tom’s 🎵 about 5 or 6 mos ago & I’m a HOG fan 4-Life now. 🤘🖤
i feel this is toms best work, its powerful.
Last time white folks got this pissed.......a king got a boot up his ass and America was born. Watch out if you in the way!
Patriotic greetings from Germany🖤🤍❤️🫶

under oath- some will seek forgivness, others escape. today i was trying to sober up and i will continue you are a blessing don't quit! the devil will try you by all means.
I love you Tom but you do brag about yourself a bit.  Nobody likes a bragert. So slow it down a bit.  Keep it true but leave yourself out of it a bit more.
baq❤ 🏴‍☠️🤕🇦🇺
Man you and Nova frggin killed it!  Got nothing but love for ya’ll
This is one of the Best
This is on my top 3 of fave songs of yours!! Either sitting at #2 possibly even #1. LOVE the vibe. Love you n your girl so very much, forever and always!! Take care 💙🖤
The only artist speaking the truth and not afraid from anything!!! You rock bro. I love your music and the massages you tell us. 🙌💪💪💪💪
Love the guitar mood. Man, I bet you can scream as well as rap.
1:40
I'm not a fan of diss tracks, but production quality on this is full stop 10/10
I hate rap....but tom speaks to me.  These are the stories/lyrics that have substance.  Thank you for bringing something new/fresh to the platform.
This Should Be At Every TRUMP RALLY 🦅🇺🇲
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🤑🇺🇸🤑🤑🇺🇸❤️🇺🇸🤑🤑❤️❤️😋
theirs is going to be more than a riot if they wrongfully put trump in prison and bar him from running
Man. I love your music cuz you go hard and no one owns you. Keep it up tom. You are a legend
Tom, just gotta say, well done. i normally never liked rap, but you made it easy and awesome t o listen to. you and nova and the whole team keep doing your thing. 😇😊
im 5 years sober today. after listening to this song, i realize meth is okay
❤️‍🔥
Ngl this guys CGI and special effects are better than a lot of recent Disney movies
Your music is energetic for sure
Spitting facts
Dig what your doing, even though it’s not my “Thing”, It’s important that more start paying attention..
Bros talent is off the fucking chart , cant believe i just found this art
I've never listened to rap I always hated it but you are totally different level I love your music I listen to it often and this is from a 69-year-old disabled veteran keep up the hits kid
This song doesn't get enough love.  Such a good jam.
Awesome bro, pure fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Keep doing the doing. Tell em where it's at Tom. You make me feel.
I haven't been this into an artist since Eminem. I was a child then, I'm now a parent of children so for an artist to interest me with their lyrics is impressive. I'm in awe of his message and style ❤️
Hope to endorse and work with Tom and Nova on a dope feature open in Cali. 3 years.. Best wishes. -Amoure Ventes
Reminds me of the final battle in Man of Steel. Superman Vs Zod.
Dude has no self awareness. He has no idea how absolutely cringey his "music" is. The only people listening are 9 to 15 y olds and older baby boomers. The first group 9 to 15 are obviously immature and the boomers are in mental decline.
Awesome!
Found Tom's music years ago, thought it was Fire 🔥 THEN he started using the same lyrics in Every song he just mixed up same lyrics in different Positions... But NOW He Look like he's Back with better Variety. Blessings Tom 🙏🏻
🇺🇸🦅🦅🇺🇸🦅🦅🇺🇸🦅🦅🇺🇸
LOVE THIS! ❤️
Dont any of those damn democrats have a mind of their own! They all vote the same no matter what 😮
love the intensity.. id love to see you make an all out rock song ..much love tom and nova
Love the guitar in this
Anyone who says things like Tom Macdonald "sucks" they need they ears checked obviously they don't understand and know about REAL MUSIC!! His lyrics His flow His beats he's just so authentic
I would be honored to stand next to Tom Macdonald any day of the week
This is my favorite song  I love your music oh and Tell NOVA I said hi
Tom, Thank You for all you do to wake people up! Right now my heart is breaking! Why would Struggle associate with JELLYROLL!! I know that you don't play these huge venue's unless you've sold your soul! I trusted Struggle, mistake! Please don't ever give in! That would devastate me!!! Cuz your #1!!
Love it! What an awesome song!
I’m 97 an listen to this on my front porch while I slowly die
💯 Proof what Tom is saying. He is independent and he is not censored and can speak. Chris rolled out a good song small town and he is a racist WTF?
When the most sane and together guy in the room would scare even Marilyn Manson…. You know you’ve come to the tipping point…..  Ain’t nobody else on earth as dope As my good friend Mr tommy Mac. sounds crazy I know where’d the logic go It’s a cryin shame but it’s still a fact…
Let's go Tom Macdonald 🇺🇸
Fiahhh
So empowering! So amped!!!
I'm constitution
Hi bliss
Beast Mode Activated! 🔥
Stop stealing asa aziz flow bru
Liked that you included guitar in this song. Was a nice change pace.   Your choruses are great have been since Trying to kill me
Please don't let billboards get you down you told us you never looked down why are you not on Britain's Got Talent or America's Got Talent that's a bigger platform watched by more people I've never heard billboards but I've had America's Got Talent and I watch it get on it man it's a big stage the world will see you greetness  Shady will be envious
I love the leather spike jacket I’m so obsessed ❤
☑️
I oive you Tom you are a messenger of The Lord
Dude I wanna make a metal drum riff for this song!!! Would you listen??
I dont care anyone other persons rapper so dont be like "HE DOESNT LIKE EMINEM REPORT HIM" I honestly could care less|Tom Macdonald is the best rapper period dont care if you support LGBTQ+  heres a gift for you |🖕
We should try to make #TomMacDonald one of the most famous hashtags ever    Update: last month I said let's get #TomMacdonald A Famous Hashtag and over the month Ive seen a lot of people use it so thanks the reason I'm saying thanks is last month I made this tag no video or short was associated with the hashtag and now ita famous so thanks
you're music lit a fire deep in me I feel like i have reclaimed my patriotism i well wouldn't say lost but i have slowly cared less because of the far left and the far right isn't good either I consider myself more of a libertarian who basically fight with everyone but I am more to the right
He needs to do a video about 2020 if he hasn’t already! About the summer of love (riots )
Das a bar
This video is fantastic and truly shows Nova's skill!
the talent of this dude is insane
Novas videos just keep getting better and better
I love the messages in your raps. It inspires to keep going. Even if it’s too dang hard. I listen to it and my hate and my negativity washes out. Thank you for standing out and up.
I know I commented late but this song is FIREEE
This kid is a product of what he is hearing and listening to im sorry but if he's listening to music with cursing and foul language he is going to be a product of exactly that. Kids are not old enough they can take many things out of proportion even if you didn't intend to make him do what he is doing he is being the exact by product of what kind of words being spoken are. If someone is hearing cursing and foul language all the time there hearts are going to be filled with exactly that.  Jesus always said our eyes are a lamp to our whole what we watch and listen to we become  He also said how one speaks shows what is in the inside of your heart   If your mouth speaks  of cursing, rage anger etc. Then you be exactly that!   But God is good that he can change a hard heart and make a dead heart, body etc.. alive again   Open your eyes and see! Jesus is Lord and he is coming back soon and only those who have received his free Gift of salvation and make him lord over there lives will be saved
I pitched the chorus to my son as his walk up song in baseball :) no pun intended. He likes the crickets :)
This Shit Goes Hard ASF❤
you're my favorite rapper.
Keep it up brother. You're my healer.
Dude you go tf in
This is the only rap I can stand. Keep up the fight, brother.
That guitar riff gets me
I respect the message I like your music keep singing
I always think of DJT vs FJB when I hear this song
mans a legend, I personally just want a track with Locksmith and Tom MacDonald if he ever does anything with American independent artists.
Brilliant marketing!  Really happy you're breaking the captured song scene.
How do you be so real and sober? I don’t have the balls until I’m a bottle in…
I have no audio for this one
I love the heavy guitar brother! Id love to make you some guitar riffs! Lets go heavy bro!💪🏆🏆🏆
Zero song structure .  Less than zero, all dude’s songs start w a “hard verse” as in hard to listen to
No cussin from canucks
White Pac in the flesh? Is this a joke
If Tom isn’t your favorite rapper, then LEAVE
🖕😝🖕       🖕😍🖕
Both Middle Fingers Throw Em In The Air! 🖕🏽🖕🏽
Keep tellin em Tom, I aspire to break away and do my own thong outside the industry because you proved we can. We love you Tom, all truth
1997 I had a friend of mine eaten by a white shark right in front of me. I haven’t felt that emotional since I’ve seen your work. Keep killing it brother
Great 👌
Thank you Blondie for rap!

Tom and Nova are such a good team. Both very talented. Keep speaking the truth Tom.
Wow your head got SUPER big. All that garbage now rolls out your mouth last year people would say that you had something to say... But.... When everything you say contradicts....You are soon becoming the next Vanilla Ice. 😂😂😂

We Want To Live By Aajonus Vonderplanitz 📚  The myth that raw food cause bacterial disease was ingrained into society when two giant food manufactures paid fortunes in research from 1928-1938 to prove that bacteria in food causes disease. They wanted to prove that their cooked and processed foods were cleaner, healthier and safer than raw foods. Animals were separated into two groups. Several groups were fed raw food and others were fed cooked, processed food. The companies' officers released to the press, the conclusion based on mere speculation and belief that the theory that bacteria in raw food caused disease. When the long-term results of that research proved that the raw-food-fed groups did not develop any disease, and that the cooked/processed-fed groups developed most of the diseases that humans suffer, the two companies burned all of the research and hid the results from the public in 1940.  Only bacteria feeding on cooked, non-organic foods are likely to turn pathogenic. E. coli feeds rapidly on frozen meat but is not dangerous if eaten raw. The worst that could happen from eating raw meat with a high bacteria count is vomit or diarrhea, yet that response is very rare, and not from poisoning. Instead, it is a radical detoxification of the liver, pancreas or intestines. The toxins are potentially damaging and so the body must flush them quickly.

Way of the world, Max Q 1989.....🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
To all the woke people , what do we do with this woke information ? We’ve established it so many different ways and the system has yet to get taken down. What are we supposed to be contributing to ? (This is in no way an attack, just wanting clarity) with the government being a necessary evil it’s hard to think it can ever get taken down honestly
Great!
I wonder if Nova studied film making or if she is self taught. Her videos Rock!
1 of the few going against the norms bringing meaning to this world . Bridging gaps
do it! NOW!!!!!!! •
🇯🇲🇯🇲
Big up
I love your words sir.
It's good to see someone will not go quietly into the night finally someone that can say it the way it is keep up the good work brother wake up a few more sheeple heaven knows they need it
I like this one, good sh*t.
Greetings from the holy jordan , supporting your couse , i appreciate your message in this song 🙏🤠
I wish this song was about an hour longer.
Shoot I work out to his music, there is much more than heard or seen,  I like him
We like and understand his music🤘
NOICE
I don't know that I've ever heard a music star that is actually independent, but Tom's one of the absolute best.
Listen to the haters🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Fuckin fire.
2023 is a silent rotting riot
THANKS FOR SPREADING  GOSPEL TRUTH N TRUE STORIES OF AN AVERAGE LIFE
I am praying for you Tom Mc Donald I love you soldier
Love the instruments in this. Badass beat.
I hear u Nathan I all I need is a friend well we were friends how'd that work out 😢
St George Street after my visit because of u
Only T.M can make a Cricket a hype man and have it SLAY.
That's the artist
is it just me or is nova getting better at cgi?
This is on 🔥 hell yeah so good!
Common Tom MacDonald L
Yo this is the first time hearing this guy he’s got a interesting appearence but this song goes hard I’m not gonna lie
...Why are you wearing a skii mask with thorns around the head and an UPSIDE DOWN CROSS BENEATH YOUR EYE.   I thought you knew the Lord ... Man this sucks... I thought weren't part of the 'Evil They'... But one cannot unsee what has just been seen...
This is most definitely one of my favorites. Hard shit: love you!❤ keep doing what you’re doing brother. We need you. More people are hearing these words and becoming believers finally.
Every time😂
This shit the bomb. Honestly keep making music.
Love all his music! Appreciate what he’s doing with his songs that address political and social issues, but songs like this and Best Rapper Ever 🔥🔥🔥
Tom is what the world needs today. The divisive anc  government in South Africa, are exactly what his message, in The System, projects. They want us hating each while they rob  us blind.
Your success has a purpose brother. No accidents and no luck. It’s bigger than you. It’s bigger than “us”.  Look higher.  The one below will try to pull you down. Just keep looking up.  Stay grounded and GB.
if you want to ring true to this Tom stop using rainbow auto tune crap
I've shared a lot of Tom's music on FB most got removed smh Fakebook still sucks
🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 RAP SONGS!!!!!!!
Tom it took me five different times with different wording to be able to pull up this song on iTunes… got it finally sending love from Ontario. iTunes get your shit together!!!
Love it❤❤❤❤
Tom's music is always interesting. I won't say that I agree with most of what he says since I try to keep an outsider's perspective and I'm also not American so I don't actually know how Ravens and Writing Desks everything is over there. However, I have great respect for someone who actively puts himself in the middle of a situation in the hopes of understanding it.
Powerful
Both middle fingers. This is one of my favourites
curious on the upside down cross at 0:24
I think I may comment most times I listen to your songs coz they so fuckin bangin. Full stop
Just found out about tom from President Trumps post on Truth Social. Tom is fire!!! Speaks the truth
Hi 🇺🇸♉🍀🌎🌏🌍
You Rock ❤️❤️
the C.O.R.!!!! CORNER OFFICE RECORDS represent
"Middle finger flippin' Got scribbles on MY face!"
Meh
Shit is banging yes sir
I love the cricket chirps xD
I love that you know your facts and aren't afraid to tell everyone.. and your amazing 🤩🤩🤩 keep doing your thing
DUDE I'M 65 LIFELONG CALIFORNIAN AND RAP AIN'T MY THING ! YOUR WORDS ARE RIGHTEOUS ! YOUR TUNES ARE COOL ! KEEP ON , KEEPIN ON !
i hope to see more artists like you! , your amazing your songs are great people disserve  the truth not whatever crap is maid Up , you insipre many and i only hope people will finaly see the truth! , tho i have low hope
As long as your smart enough to NOT be bought out by the Illuminati and Masons.  They are Evil. I'm not one for Rap.... However I do like hearing the TRUTH in your messages/songs.  If more people wake up and realize, We don't need the government to control us.   Like that song "Another brick in the wall"    Quotes from the song, "We don't need our thoughts Controlled,  We don't need no education" https://youtu.be/qRoCIu67emw
Tom McDonald, you damage your music's Likability /  Playback-Ability for me because of much chorus you have in your songs.
The man commands respect and speaks the truth!  The music and message is deep and meaningful, like going to church.
Hey Tom I’ve got a year left to live and would  mean the world if you’d feature before my time here is up, lyrics : Verse 1 : the human race is failing and it’s all because of hate  The detrimental feelings that our phones put in our brains  Says we are all failure and that all we do is ‘fake’  I been sleeping near these demons now they follow when I wake Is this what you wanted ? Turning us fucking insane ? Well here you fucking go,now we are breaking down  again Deliver us from evil or just put us in our place There’s more to life than downing pills , injecting in your veins 10 bucks for an hour of your life on minimum wage While they’re hiking up the prices,   Poison water in your drains I can tell you all but you one thing, that this  simply can’t sustain What worries me the most . its down to us to break this chain The evils far from over ‘22 was just a game They’ve  opened up the gates for mass control It’s in your face can’t seem to lift this fucking veil of violence and  the hate The control has got to end we know it’s all one big mistake   DOUBLE CHORUS   Their poisoning the skies, it falls down in acid rain Ohio’s all fucked up and it weren’t no damn mistake They burnt the chlorine into the sky and left it there to shake Up the ecosystem and the fishes in the lakes The poison that is killing us wont show before too late Slowly killing us until we fall into our grave  warfare at its finest, they’re tryna drive us all insane I guess it’s fucking working cos I fucking hate this place no shortage in the food chain just the greed from those who make Us picking up the pennies while we wonder in the rain They took our freedom, took our jobs, and business all the same It’s getting to the stage where we cant even concentrate On the goals that we made, and the dreams that’s in our brains You can’t achieve what you want when you’re always fucking late On your payments and your mortgage and the self care that we take  The madness that is going on we’re bound to lose this game  CHHORUS X2.    Russias really fighting evil  in the USA NATO always pushed too hard and now it’s just too late The UK falls apart while Boris Johnson’s on a plane Parties up in Downing Street and sniffing his cocaine,  while we’re locked down in our houses just wondering how to take The financial hit, your business quit, its boarded up with tape If this is all we’re here for sit us down,  open the gates,  there’s more to life   The bells will ring when it comes to our  doomsday  The seas will come and cover earth, a massive tidal wave  The end is near but one things clear That all we got is faith  I’m sick of all the punishment that we just can not take The food and all the GMO’s are cancer by the steaks The fruits injected with that shit how can we not complain ?!  I can tell you now, we won’t sit down, this is heading but one way It’s self destruction at its best unless we make a change  I’ll try until my final breath, I’ll give it all it takes My heart is bleeding wondering will it ever be the same  If It ain’t enough, I pray to god that he will rise again. Blessed   Amen
🔥
I bet I could beat you at arm wrestling....
Way narly cool I'm in love with the life .in service to truth and life dude deep respects value truth freedom an real love dose no harm .thanks brother
Hey Tom I love your moisc so dues my mom

If Tom hates pop how come he keeps making pop songs I wanna hear something like don’t look down homie moved worlds with that song
What the actual f. How do people like trap. Also here because I googled worst albums of all time and his work is blowing the top spots up. This is awful. I never wanna meet the person who says this is good.
Fun fact: Cricket sounds cure ear ringing/tinnitus.
🔥🔥🔥😇🔥💣🤯💣🔥😈🔥🔥🔥
@Tom Macdonald we need your 2023 tour dates!!
This is 🔥🔥🔥
I can’t wait for warmer weather so I can ride with my windows down while I play Tom’s CD’s!

You’re a straight up G bro…. Love a good success story
This man deserves more respect than all these other  fake ass rappers on YouTube. He's made it without any  labels  and speaks the fuckin truth.  Absolutely fuckin fire.
Not a huge fan of hip hop, but Tom McDonald is such an inspiration that I like it!
Can u imagine how many subs he would have if this platform wasn’t dropping 80% Of his new subs? Or views…. It would be jaw dropping
Hello👋 just the truth.. Stopping by to make sure we all fully understand. Bc It takes me(1 person) a little time to uncover all the truths. *ONWARD
Hello👋 I am in your comment section bc I do mot recall what happened while I was asleep
Awesome
Fan since day one my guy 😈
🌎🔥⚠️👁️🐍😈🤘💤
At 62 years old, I appreciate your message. I enjoy your music. It’s real, it’s factual. I appreciate the fact that you are a self made man and have been extremely successful. You and your Wife stand for what you believe in and that is refreshing in this World We live in. I look forward to your future work. Let them know, We see, We hear, We know.
Let’s remember BLACK HAVE BEEN SAYING THE SAME THING ! Now it’s popular ? Get some collaboration and have us believe you kid . ❤
The beat is sick and well produced but don't care for these cheesy lyrics.
Thanks for what you do Tom. You wake up a lot of people from their sleep, I love it 🥰👍 Lots of love 🙏❤🥰
Love you love the song and video ❤HOWEVER I can’t get out of my head that you are standing on a pile of poop 😂😂😂😂😂
❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥
Having a small business that goes against the narrative, I know exactly how this feels lol shadow banned and all! Keep speaking truth Tom, it motivates us to see how far you’ve come.
I love everything about you and what you stand for!! Your music rocks your voice is mesmerizing Nova is one lucky lady! Your ghost song and video is awesome wish everyone can find someone like that. Keep doing what you do you have helped so many people when they were lost I know I'm one of them.
This ish right here! 🙌🏽💯🔥 much love Tom & Nova!
Hi this from Uk my dad and all us MacDonald too ,,,
Sounds like a bad version of a mix of Eminem and Tech N9ne
I dont believe this only has 4m views.
THIS! I love it!! this is def one of my absolute faves!! Excellent! I can't articulate how  ecstatic I am at how well known you have become in the music industry!! And getting more famous every day! It is very well deserved considering your hard HARD work along with your supportive family and darling gf! Even more impressive?? You didn't sell out and you nvr will! You are the paragon for the future indie artists! you shld be very proud! And how humble u have remained is nothing less than exemplary!! I love how you keep it real, speak your mind with conviction and say what a majority of ppl are thinking  but are too afraid to say.  Kudos, Tom! Here's to your continuing rising fame!!! 🥂
Incredible. Beyond words.
Keep BLASTING out your message Tom! ✨🔥💥❤️‍🔥💥🔥✨
He went pop and wrecked them all.  Go listen to Ghost now
This song is 100% about yourself, and I honor that brother
Shit on you back in the day,but glad your following your dreams man,sorry for being a piece,at least your doing what you want
This needs to be put in a film
"When Law and Morality CONTRADICT each other, the citizen has the cruel alternative of either losing his moral sense or losing his respect for the law."- Frederick Bastiat
Thank you both and your family for doing what you all.  I am fully woke for years and finally found you, all your words are strong, to the point and the sheep will not understand your messages however the way you are speaking bars is spot on! There is not 1 song I don't like. Stay safe and pray that others will see your messages and not bullshit rappers sorry for that to the others but yeah you got it and I'm spreading your words around fast. God bless 🙌   Staying woke
jesus cover them by your blood your the lamb ove GOD that takes away the sins of the world amen
Help others while you still can Encouraging words and listening are very valuable. Stop trying to keep up with the Joneses they are not ur leader or savior
Where's the explicit version?
I know I liked this vid before, but here goes again!
Imitating being on the cross is not cool!!!
U ever see internal darkness where u at my boy it's not a biblical plague Greek I.I.I. up slash in c'mon where is I want my one
it is so good!
i hate rap music made by thugs and killers about stealing and robbing.. but this has meaning mr Mcdonald keep it up!! 🙏🙏🇺🇸
I will not go mainstream now you know I hate pop  He couldn't anticipate that months later he'd be number 1 in the charts 😄
this one is so good
this is hard… to listen to
Love this song so much. The beats are sick and addictive. My gym work out music
really digging this style
I'm not trying to be a dick, but why do you wright curse words into the raps you're just going to censor it out? It's like buying an old-school Eminem CD from walmart. I'm not trying to diss you for not cussing, I'm just trying to figure out why you essentially write a blank spot in your song. It just feels like it kills the flow.
yo tom did you promote this as your other music because this track slaps your top 10 for sure
Talent
he go hard!!!
danm!!!!!!!!!!
John 3:16
fire man
Tommy good cunts know good lads .  Or is it good lad know good cunts . .
This did not age well.  Congratulations Tom on #1 Ghost
I was never a rap fan. I am now. Thanks Tom
You guys should do a collaboration with this lil guy 😁👀 https://youtu.be/UFt2pt7eTyY
Grammy Worthy!  But it should be melted down into a new award of your making.
Song goes HARD.
You apologized for saying you hate "Pop" & in the same song call yourself a "Rockstar/Pop star".....?
CHRISTIANS ARE THE SHEEP. JESUS CHRIST IS THE GOOD SHEPHERD. THE GOATS ARE SENT TO THE LAKE OF FIRE. THE SHEEP STAY WITH JESUS CHRIST 🙏 READ REVELATION 20.

It would be awesome for a small nobody fan to have an opportunity to meet someone they are big fan to. Maybe it could help get thru depression there are a lot of things in life that makes it hard to get thru depression but to meet some one you adore would be a huge lift in life because depression is mainly worrying if others want you around and so if a famous person took interest in a little nobody fan it would really help keep from taking the wrong roads in life. Motivation is difficult thing to come by when you feel like a nobody as much as i do all the time. Thanks for reading this if you do tom even if you don't care just the fact that you read it would be great 😀😎😎😎😎😎
Pyatt rhymes with Riot. Dropped the ball there. 😳
Yooo that riff is sick man! This guy is by far the GOAT.
Damn Tom!  Absolutely amazing.  Your lyrics blow me away and my young girls can FINALLY listen to music they love without nasty, demonic stuff.  😢🙏❤️👍 Amazing sir!
LOVE it so much
I am 245 yo and don't care about rap except for Tom
Why are all your vids edited?  Beeping out f-bombs? Why? There's plenty of songs on this format that isn't edited.
Hey man,  I realllly dig all your work. Came across this, and thought, whoah...New song. NOPE.  It's a fake account with some nonsense lame rap game stuff. Check it out.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hqJFDYLh54  You're mega radical, mi amigo. It's no joke about the frail human ego...If you allow it to bruise you, you will do stupid games. They always get stupid prizes.  God bless, my friend!
I'm listening to this while writing a research paper on why we should get rid of race and just see people it so we stop dividing everyone from each other
Tech N9ne should of been on this 💯
This video is unbelievable. Like all the others. Hat tip to Nova. My personal opinion is she is one of the best in the business. Don't think Tom would be where he is today without her. Let me explain a little. A true man is one of the most powerful things in this world we live in. BUT a good woman is the power in us men.
Hate pop, but now got the #1 pop song.
Love this
Am sorry but this music is garbage
"i dont care til im a *ghost* or cripple" any inspiration for the song title ghost from here i wonder?
Oh yes, bring rap-rock back with fire lyrics.
True reason to strive and have hunger for success is this man and his family
Tom macdonald its  amazing
Truthful
Awesome vid Tom and Nova!!
❤❤❤❤❤
THANK YOU !!!  YOUR MUSIC IS POWERFUL AND SPEAKS RAW TRUTH!!!!!   MAY OUR EYES AND EARS BE OPEN .  UNITED WE SURVIVE DIVIDED WE DIE!

Love this man
This guy is my hero
Tom and nova make the best music period. Our ears are open and our hearts are listening!!!
Thats the guitar ive been waiting for.
He said he hates pop in this song but his song ghost is totally a pop song, lol that's irony!!!
Here's The Drill Remix Of This, That I Said I Was Going To Make. https://youtu.be/qmq_YAZkljs
Love you brother,  your music hits home for real.
Poppin on a different tip...BUMP IT T!!!
The Hook Is So Contagious

The beat and atmosphere on this one......
Nova's Vid's are the 💩❗Straight 💥💥er❗Killer Vid❗CONGRATULATIONS Nova & Tom👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻. Takes me back to when I'd stay up to watch MTV all night. To see Michael Jackson's Vids
Love the Guitar in this one!
Great lyrics! Love Tom for his meaningful songs unlike the mainstream brainwashing crap.
Mega !! -  America in a pill not to swallow !?!?
Finally I’ve found a blonde that knows what they’re talking about.
Awesome 🤘
We must protect Tom Macdonald at ALL costs. God bless you Tom 🙏 ❤
Use Tommac T mac
Tom McDonald sounds like a country singer lol
This guy only produces hits....unreal! No filler.
😲 you in my head?
Love it
No
Kk
wait, "why you cappin'" didn't you just release a song saying that people who use the word "cap" are being dumbed down? which is it, maggy? i need you to pick a lane lol
bro you got 4m views on this; i hate to break it to you, you're basically right wing mainstream. sorry, i know that must sting, but i don't think its fair to call yourself indie anymore lmfao
Semper fi Tom, thankyou
Independent inspirers.
super geil
Not a huge fan of Tom's music... but I gotta say this is dope 🙌 👌 👏
Thank you Tom for who you are..Stay true,stay real,stay genuine..
the fact he can sing but still uses autotune just for the style is fire as fuck 🔥
This Song Is So Lit. For Real, For Real, Gonna Do A New Wave/Drill Remix Of This.
Did he just really call himself the “White Pac”?….please tell me he just didn’t! 😂
Damb Thomas chill out my guy sheesh
Huge fan, but I need an explanation, you said 'I will not go mainstream dog you know I hate pop'. Yet you currently have the #2 pop song in the country... Maybe I'm reading a little too much into it but the contradiction here is making me question your authenticity bro.
Just a question… is that supposed to be an upside down cross at 0:24? The dimensions look a bit off… I know St. Peter was crucified upside down but what are you portraying with this symbol @ Tom MacDonald
Don't ever stop Tom. Your music is amazing.  Love it love it love it. ❤️
All i can say is wow. When i see media write about a new artist I know I have to listen. Man your tuned in.
1.25× playback speed is godly
Ooh boy, another white man complaining about how much he's being cancelled... on his account with over millions of views... Right
Like over here if you wished great tom was your neighbor  👇
I like your music but I heard that you're a Satanist. Is it true?
#hangovergang
I dont even listen to this kind music but i thought I'd give it and try and 🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪😋👑🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆your flow is sick
"Ur a fucking nobody, a legit clown." I hope you guys see how Jesus fixes everything. Whoever has my phone clone, I'd like to go home now.
Crickets........ Nice touch!!
"Till I'm a GHOST on Christmas" Tom always gives us clues & ties everything together. Bravo Tom MacDonald u sly fox🧐
Sorry,  I think he sucks!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Sometimes I get soo caught up in the video itself that i don't even hear the song. Novas is killin these videos man. Normally I couldn't give a shit less about the music vid to w.e song I listen to but I find that with you 2 I often have to watch a cpl times before I finish the song.
👋
Probably the best independent music videos beside Tech. The monetary behind the production is completely different though.(owning a label is way different than being independent, no knock towards Tech. He built his own shit."
My favorite song of Tom’s here. 🔥
Kicking rocks......... Tom is on 🔥
You are both CREEPY and SEXY at the same time ... Not sure how u do it... But WOWW 💜 NICE.
Drummer for hire... 👋👀🎶🥁
Thank you so much for giving us a beautiful piece of art, and using your voice to tell the truth. We will sing with you!! 🤙🎤🎶
Major Messenger ✨🔥✨❤️✨💛✨🔥✨
Nice  , Very Nice !!!
👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻
I am so glad God gave you the voice, and talent, to spread the truth, as far as the music industry goes. We can't even trust Christian music these days, the Devil has his hooks in all grenades', except the independent musician's, whom have not signed away their soul's, for fame, and money. You, and Nova are bad ass, keep it up, your fan's love you, for being genuine.
Funny….I’m subscribed and bell notified but no alert to this song.  Who’s playin games!!
One of my favorite songs to listen to. It's got an empowering and inspiring energy to it.
Pure 🔥 my dude . . Pure 🔥.
I’m 56 and you are my new favorite. Kids made me listen to Shady back in the day and not gonna lie I loved his story…. But I love your words. Godspeed Tom and Nora!! ❤
I like the social vids better
Dang Tom. You are non stop spitting Hits G! Hella proud of you and the Ever EPIK H.O.G. Say I have 0 space for apps. But would love to work on a project with you and thee Krew. Let me know if your at all interested. Hope your ChristMass  was Great.  Keep em Rollin in Big Dog!🤘🐯🌞🌞🌞🦅🦅🦅🇺🇲💯😈
............
Yes sir 🦈
White pac in the flesh you are not....
🌲❤️🧐⭐ 😃 Glædelig jul.
❤
Great song!!!!!!!
oh so this is what bad cringe music sounds like
Hey @Tom I just discovered your music 🎶 Keep getting inspired, say the truth, nothing but truth.
Love the hook on this man. Love this vibe!! I forgot to listen to this one damn.
🗑
I will rank this second best song ever from Tom. It was tough
Dudes legit! Sorry if posted twice, my Phone Spazzed trying to comment.
Now you are a popstar with Ghost haha
WOW your iconic!
Bravo Tom, I absolutely love this song. The metal riff and keyboard behind it create an epic sound. Can you do a few more songs with metal riffs? I think it complements rap really well.
You’re the best man but keep your ego in check or you will fall.
God Bless ya Tom.
Yes...love the metal guitar sound in this song.
The cyberpunk father, that we didn’t ask for, but that we deserve
Sad that one day he will do gigs sponsored by capital one credit card and tell everyone to get jabbed /s
Straight out the gate First two lines speak volumes  Remain blessed ❤️😎♥️ Epic stuff Listening bout 2-3 years I guess Never a let down with you  Mass appreciation Loud love is rare
Mega top very nice clip ...! The passages really get under your skin. With a deep bow my respect, wow wow wow ...! And many warm greetings from Germany ❤ 🔥❤ 🔥❤ 🔥❤ 🔥❤ 🔥❤ 🔥💯💞💣💣💣💣💣💣
Heh, somebody hit home and got hit back. Sometimes ya gotta be the statue that hits back.
Still waiting for the two new albums and Renegade tshirt to come. 2 weeks now, hope it comes soon !!!
👍
Tom...why is it censored??
Tanx mc mac.
Super GOAT
Numerou uno!
I haven’t been listening to rap for yrs now except for the old stuff. It all just sounds the same to me. I herd fake woke awhile back & became a fan. The only rap I listen to these days is Tom. Even if he sold out
I'm not ready to die why you think I've been fighting
I will fight I don't want to die not like that
Okay good luck with that
Trump versus Biden tribute lol
We are with you
Hey Tom, Wanna let you know you are my inspiration to make music. I've been listening to your music for almost 5 years now, you keep me going. THANK YOU!
M
Father of three, 19, 14, 10.  Tom Macdonald is the only rapper that I'm proud my boys listen too.
Shout out to Nova Rockefeller for the domestic videos!!! Love y'all!!!

Bruh Tom went beast mode here
Love you guys. Mrs lady Nova, Madchild, and Tom. Thanks for the New music. You're the answer to my prayers. My kids thank you too.

For me this is epic ❤🇨🇦❤
FINALLY! A KINDRED SPIRIT MAKING THOUGHT-PROVOKING MUSIC. THANK YOU TOM. MUCH LOVE FROM KENYA!
I aint gonna chill homey sit down..
Love the music and the message. Tom Macdonald is the only music I listen to. One question, where do you get your contacts from? I love the black ones
DUDE the beat in this!! I love the rock in it too!
This is probably your best video.  Nova killed it!
Still ain't topping Eminem no matter what song he comes up with
Want to warn everyone who got a "congrats you won..." they will tell you to telegram and eventually you are asked to pay for shipping of your mysterybox win, shippingcost is between 50$-150$. So if you "won" don't bother exploring it. Classic scam.

Every where i go it is very silent, no response or comeback just so silent, its my dope meditative state,
Love the video ,love that your doing it on your own,your a bright shining star in this world of darkness. Keep on keeping on my friend
The people still need to wake up. We need a change tomorrow. I know how to shut the IlumiNATTI down. It’s time to get it going we don’t have all day anymore
WOW Tom MacDonald I have to say straight fucking 🔥🔥🔥
WOOO
Love this shit 🎉 man !!!
why so quiet ? I dont know, why so scary ?
The government politicians are taking full advantage of the people. Living
Yo yt y u messing with the comments? Left a comment on names and now it's here?
Dec 6 2022 and all my comments are gone again. We come back here to share. Why do you mess with us?
“White Pac”? No. F*ck no. Tom, you will never be anything even close to Tupac. Smfh
This is like Satan to his Mother, found in Revelation 17-19 of The Holy Bible - The Arch Angel Revelation of God The Mother and Father
Tom and Zuby should do a colab....
Tom's music and Nova's opticals are an unbeatable combination you guys are great together. im 63 and love you both , God bless you for the messages you're putting out there
You couldn’t go mainstream even if you wanted to, Tom. The majority of people are smarter than the sh*t you shovel. Lmao
I hope I misheard “white Pac in the flesh”. 😬
"Even if I never made another dollar again, I'm blessed" So true man
DAM Man I wish you were born in America...bc then we'd be able to make you mutha fn president!!!!!
Yes.
7 days without Tom MacDonald makes one weak/week.
Just Started my own mosh pit when I first heard this track #hangovergang4life
Tom MacDonald, this is the best song besides dummies. I like that one that was really good.

3rd time to listen to this today on youtube...why? Cause my 2 autographed albums arent here yet....Hopefully today..
MORE METAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!METAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...add some slipknot style in that mix BOYE
This has to be my most fav song by Tom. As I am more into rock vs. rap.  6 feet deep, that’s a underground rapper….bars 😂 Tom over here baring rappers, then using there corpse for nutrition to fuel his drive. 😂 That’s one hell of a garden tom 😂
Come and get down!!!!!!   💯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥Straight fire #HOG
Legit one of the best songs and videos I have ever seen. Legendary
Blasted this in my family home I’m an army brat grew up with cops fire army and my dad after retiring from the military crash rescue aka black hawks going down he went back to fighting fires and emt my bitch of a cunt mom (I’m 100% birth adopted) got pissy because it don’t seem safe and Christian or pure I laughed and danced around  going you need to pull you head out your ass and be get back into the truth or I’m double tapping when shit hits the fan
I love this song. They scare to try and cancel Tom for real
Real lyrics and real hard working independent writer dude is a legend continue going up sir!
was this a spin from big sean Blessings? just asking??
How dababy fell off and he's not
400 years it's written that GOD did not spoke .. ?  People were alone ? .. During that time... Chek the last book from the old .. Mel. Was made I think the order of the church back then dividing in a way the people  .. Then Jesus came...  And here we are  now.. today ... Vatican is selling forgiveness for 500 €  ????????????????  The richest Country... how do we still have poverty on the planet...  Between the lines..  the book is full with wisdom..
So…Tommy boy…u a family plant? The tats on the face and the 80%truth 20% bullshit makes me wonder. U a part of theATANIC fam boy?
3.8 my ass. Where did all the views go? Today is 11.29.22 shows 27k comments
Born in 71, I thrashed  to Metallica and was there when Grandmaster Flash released the message. I like both.   This is the perfect blend. Props to your struggle bro and seeing the other side. Keep rolllin. I'm there.
Tom you are deffo the one I love your music.
Can’t lie, being a telepath & being quiet allows me to project the thoughts into your head that allows artists to project that into the frequency spectrum so the targets never on my back. A good general never has to step on the front lines 😉
We want a tour Tom???
Awesome!!
Factss this is one of the hardest beats I heard in a min great song Tom I'm a paraplegic from 2 gun shots to the Torso I fought an lived threw it an drug addiction I'm a warrior 💯
i can see why the industry doesnt want to put another clone on lol
#hangovergang😎🤟
Like ya music but happy to end 6 foot under 👌 you are apart of the music industry whether you like it or not
Tom Macdonald  Bro you killing it.
Blessed or Fake?
ALL LOVE YALL ARE TRULY THE FUCKING BEST COUPLE IN HIP HOP RIGHT NOW PERIOD! I BET JAY AND B ARE A LIL JELLY OF YALL! OBVIOUSLY THIS IS ALL SAID WITH A SMILE SO NO DISRESPECT MR AND MRS CARTER!
NOVA! TOM! DU MILLS "DEVILS" "GRATITUDE"  He Rocks His Truth Just Yall and everybody yall create a masterpiece with!
Not crazy about the upside-down cross satanic symbols at 0:24, really don't understand the need for that. If you're not part of mainstreem media than why are you including somthing ususally forced by them?
Hey Tom I think your a punk rocker in rap form
Love you Tom great content thanks appreciate you
Tom Macdonald I love all of your music so much thank you for always putting it on the line
Lol why u censor cuss words?
so bad bruh
somethings wrong when your fans are 40+
❤
Just saw him on tiktok and this music video really looks like it was made by Hollywood.
That is sick
Nova does some crazy shit, she is so talented HANG OVER GANG STRONG 💪, keep it coming 🔥
👌🤫
"No one knows your name, that's why you always gotta name drop!!!" 🤣🤣🤣🤣 that one's gotta hurt
Tom I really think you should do some live shows because you were talking about quitting. Nah dude you are rapping the stuff that the mainstream are thinking, but you and Nova are KILLING them.  I don't think the media really understand your messages to the world! Even though you're right on point I think you need a larger audience for real instead of YouTube but that's my own opinion. Love you Tom and Nova!
When's cricket's album drop??? I'm getting it.
You just keep belting out hit after hit! You are more than solid my brother!
If you know this back story it makes this even sweeter.  Nice work Tom
The fact that there are 67 year old men listening to this makes me chuckle. God bless you, Tom.
🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥
You're a breath of logic and rationality, thanks Tom.
Valley of dry Bones?
Don't like it. But I get it. You made it on your own.
Keep grinding, brother.
Why the cross upside down on the ski mask? I don’t need a history lesson on how the cross ain’t Christian, regardless of where the cross came from, it still a symbol of the believer community. So why it turned down? It’s subtle symbols like these, that turn into flies in ointment.
man this song is shit!!!
Learn the truth about how Rockefeller got together with all the major labels and planned this thing called RAP or Hip Hop. Find out about their privately owned for profit business model and prison system. Then you will be able to piece together this sad truth about the music industry. Kudos to Tom et al for sticking up their HUGE middle finger to the "Biz". Goodbye Satan....Goodbye.
Yo I just came across your music and this has to be some of the worst music I have ever heard
Thanks Tom ...
#Renegade #Revolution #HOG🔥🔥🔥
I forget what this rap technique is called "island skipping" or something like that. Anyway impressive CG considering it was homemade. The metal hip hop fusion might need a bit more seasoning though.
This gave me chills! The thought that the four of you produced this is simply astounding! I saw you video about how making these albums near broke you, when things are at their darkest at the moment, when you push through it, when you get to the other side, that’s when things are at their brightest. Congratulations! All your hard work and perseverance has paid off! I am and you should be so proud of your work here. ❤❤❤
Oh God I wish song would go for long, love the beat of it, it's very gripping and just want more lol. Wicked video Tom, absolutely love everything you throw out!!
Not a rap fan, but I make quite a few exceptions for Tom. From a rock and metal guy, this song is fire! Visuals are great too!
🤛🤛🤛👍👍👍
next DBZ should adopt this song.
Tom you don't understand there's a difference between shining a light on the issue and repetitively digging into it the more you focus on it the more attention people will give it the idea here is for it to disappear because we focus on what we want in our reality we create our reality you're supposed to channel the Earth the Stars well the stars are kind of iffy I've been doing that and that hasn't been going well channel the Divine spark within you there you go and you won't go wrong with that that'll bring your next album and it will be the most brilliant piece you've ever seen anyone's ever seen watch cuz you are freaking intense already so do some good stuff with it because believe me all your words your sound effects others real change with a solid foundation is created in love we are creators not destroyers
Not bad at all the video is pretty dope great job !
Bruh I missed the drop 😫  Such a banger!
🤘🫡🙏🇺🇸
you got fans from middle east now 🔥💛 keep it up champ ,  Greetings from Libya 🇱🇾
This music made me start researching black magic and the 👿 himself. I now sacrifice animals in his majesties royal fiery pit. 🦀🦀 🦀 🍲
please stop making music
Nice.
Please don’t stop making music
My 2 New albums “Renegade” and “Revolution” are OUT NOW only at  https://www.hangovergang.com Grab your autographed copies and merch packs before they’re gone!
This world is a messed up place with all of its misplaced values and beliefs. We need more artists like you to speak up for those of us who just don't get heard anymore.
This is catchy asf ima be cruising blasting N singing this. Hell yeahhhh 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
My new favorite workout song! There's literally nothing about this dude but amazing, genuine, courageous, and inspiring! America loves you Tom! God Bless you and Nova.
this is one of my fav songs from tom my fave is the system you help me when i am feeling down thank u dude you are the best rapper i have ever found my mom and dad listens to you and so does my aunt and grandparents
he's bought and paid for by the people he claims he's against
Tom Macdonald is a top g. No cap
This is a banger. Cool video too
Heavy stuff tom I like it
My 60 something year old counselor recommended u to me dude so glad he did 🔥🔥😎😎
Lookin like a walker with those eyes 🔥🔥😎😎
I can’t get enough of this song
love it brother
Bro , your girlfriend is on another level what comes to editing
I was just thinking about how it feels like he came out of nowhere and now he’s blowing up. In reality he’s been working hard for YEARS to get to where he is now. Well done man. You’re the fucking MAN
Need stop the satanic style buddy ur goofy style was better
See i like him bt then I realized how he gets away with it then I noticed there last names are the richest family's in USA nd are probably sick being around them 🤔 so they came to do music nd try reach the ppl nd speak truth nd where in the age of truth so even evil cnt hide from the ppls no more
Tom is the New Phenomenon. Bringing Generations together. 🤜🤛
❤❤awesome !  Totally loving the spiked jacket! I would so where that everywhere!!!
Honestly, if you guys really think this is what good rap is, then you all need to listen to Immortal Technique. That guy does what Tom does, but with actual creativity, actual burns, and actual talent. A lotta people know him for Dance with the Devil, but I know him for Point of No Return, and Cause of Death, which all make Tom's Snowflakes, Sheeple, and Names feel like a first timer's attempt at hip hop.  Think I'm just saying that because you think I'm offended? Tech's story about the product of a ghetto breed capatalistic mental who danced with the devil offended me more than whatever exact same nonsense Tom will say all the time about trans women.

i KNOW this isnt a politcal video but I think Tom is the voice of the people who are afraid of being shamed for their beliefs and how they feel, which is why we keep it inside, and we become depressed.  When I heard white boy I felt exactly what the song was talking about and even those around me (10 non-white people parole-to Halfway House) all saidt they understood as well and liked the bravery. Yet Ill even admit I was too afraid (especially in LA at the time) to tell others how much I fucked with his music. But once i tapped in and saw who homie really is and "Sad Rappers" I've been supporting him ever since and letting people know he is top 5 RN in a what I like to call the "super-lyrical" lane...Eminem, Aesop Rock, Mickey Factz etc
Damn nova videos are lit.  Music is lit for sure. God bless Tom.  Keep breaking down the mainstream
Thank you for telling the TRUTH! 63 yrs old and I love your music! Gives me hope for your generation after all! Pray for you daily
Finally a musician thats not Woke😁 Even Eminem went all woke🙄
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Pure  🔥 as always!!
TOM MACDONALD FOR PRESIDENT
Damn Tom it seems like more people tell you to chill you go harder and harder and keep breaking the mould. Straight up modern day Pac. You have a message, a will to fight for change, something lost on rappers these days who lost this spirit somewhere in the early 2000s
Hello good morning Tom, wow awesome, excellent song and music. Love your video. 👍👍👍😍🎶
What's good about Tom is you can come back and listen again. It's so fast. So much packed in. The somebody will say something good or bad about him to make you come back. I never regret that🧐
Tom I just found you and I love your words. I am a 68 year old rocker. In one week I have introduced you to my children in their forties my grandchildren in their twenties and my great grandchildren. You're generational well done.
BLM should listen to this. And white people.  You suck for joining this fake movement.
Men !!  Your songs must sound amazing with some good guitar riffs and breakdowns 👌👌👌
Not a big fan of Tom’s style of rap, but I very much respect his message and the fact that he’s totally independently promoted and produced. Cudos brother.
Keep doing you boo boo. Every song hits and it hits differently..
Hay Tom  I now have every song you put out on every platform that has your music. Thanks for ripping the skeletons out of these corrupt politician's closet. I listen to your music every day so thank you hope you see this and know how many proud Americans stand with you.
This is an awesome song!💗
You tell them Tom! They "so quiet"! 👍🏽 Great music, lyrics and production! Love it!
Yup.
You make consistent good music it’s impressive
Your words are how most of us feel!  Love that!!!
I had beef with you a few years ago on Facebook when I was “woke” and you responded. Just wanted ya to know I’m normal now, and I now understand and appreciate your message.
I listen to this on Spotify on repeat
Waiting for #Sheeple to start a #Riot. You must be a #Fighter.
👍
DAAAAAAAAMMMNNNN!!!! Goosebumps 👀
Never stop giving pops to white mops in the flesh? 😄 It's so fast but I don't wanna read the lyrics
I am NOT a Hip-Hop guy I'm a metalhead, but I know a good battle song when I hear one and this track's as FIRE as a "Mostly Peaceful Protest"
So BADASS
Like when you talk about braids I'm a white girl I have braids I like them they put me down for it it don't matter cuz I like them
You and Ryan Upchurch need to make a song I swear to god it'd #1 for years!
This is really satanic. I do enjoy some of your music but when i watch the video i know something is off. You talk about being saved but from looks of it, you're far from it. Most people won't understand because they don't read their bibles but this one is basically the fall of satan to earth, lighting in the background on purpose. Then false Christ pose near the end on top of bones. Sure people will hate which is ok, just pointing out the facts. Also this song didn't like so much, but do like your work. Maybe turn away from the evil and give Jesus some praise.
This is your best , love it
Bad ass …. yet again 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
I dunno👀🧐. It's catchy. It's got a good beat and I can...🪲 out to it. Just bored lately youtoob is aaasssooo
Hi Tom I'm 1072 years old and have seen nations rise and fall and you have inspired me and my 251 decendants lol.   JK good stuff.  Had a question, why do you have so many elderly fans?  You should rock retirement homes with the demo you are pulling.   I caught so much shit from your fans for pointing out the elderly clout you are getting.  Only pointed out that it's interesting and I get bumrushed with shit talking comments.   I'm a fan too... but yeah seems like your fan are also cannibalistic and quick on the trigger finger.... which is funny because your focus is nuanced and thought provoking... human nature I suppose... tough crowd lol.  Keep up the killer work.
Loved it
the only thing bad about this song is that its not long enough.
Crickets chirping. Hilarious 😆
Cabo for Christmas?
You don't take no crap TOM MACDONALD U ARE THE ONLY ONE WHO IS THE BEST
thanks bro my sister left tik tok and came back to normal sanity trough your music your a antidote for the brainwashing that takes place you redo the brain damage with cheer truths You elon musk and Trump are real Bros we can chance the world  back to mom dad dog cat daughter and son house tree and truly being happy not all this modern day  society bullshit insanity lets pray and hope for the mental and psychical healing off humanity  thanks Tom MacDonald keep on spitting
This is possibly the worst song I’ve heard this week . 🎉 You get a prize
NOT quit, just banned from most of the Social media platforms for speaking the TRUTH... Like millions of others... But hey We The People of the World are NOT going to take any more of this BS [Bad Stuff] Look at all of the countries of the World that see what's going on and know something is wrong...  WWG1WGA... 17... Deus Vult...  PS GOD wins in the END...
CRINGE CRINGE CRINGE
I think you did great on amazing on riot

Damn them cords in the beginning..  yep  ... Tom, has  metal in his blood he has forever ... rap  pop rock rapper
Work hard, play hard!👍🎧
Same thing again! I can't even believe it. Rapping the verses, that same weird pause at the end of the first verse, then singing the choruses. Come on man try something different even your fans will get sick of this soon

You are incredibly talented,  smart,  and brilliant.  With that being said,  I know you are smart enough to find a better way without using the f-bomb. Keep up the great work using the talent God gave you.  God Bless you  many times over. 🙏

Fuck man you the illest man love the music   hope all is well man The be chilling  Love the end LoL
Yo bruh, you need to make a metal song, you'd catch a huge audience 🤘😎🍻🇨🇦
“Put you six feet deep, that’s an underground rapper” killed that
I like the dude, I like the message, but I’m just not into the music.
What a BANGER!!!!
Tom...think ur msgs are great! 56 yr old...tired of this world... waiting on Jesus to return. Appreciate your honesty ❤️
I hate rap music but I love Tom MacDonald and what he puts out because it’s the TRUTH AND FACTS we need to hear. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Love from india 🙏❤️
yesirrrr
oh, this is good; the algorithm had this far in the back burner I'm glad i came back to look you've gotten better at slipping the genre the power metal rifts in this rap are rock solid you're doing great.
Tom McDonald is a living contradiction. He's a walking meme. He's a satire of himself.   He's a Canadian posing as an American nationalist.   He regularly criticises modern rap while being the embodiment of commodified and generic modern rap.   He talks about being censored and cancel culture as his videos and songs rack up tens of millions of views and plays on mainstream platforms like YouTube and Spotify.   He regularly targets millennials with criticism in his rap but he's very literally just a millennial who "raps" right-wing talking points, straight from the Fox News echo chambers to a demographic of fans largely made up of boomers and late teen to adolescent young white men with conservative values and cult-like obsession with identity politics and conspiracy theories.   His music career is either a very clever grift cashing in on the toxic politics and fringe radicalisation of kids in the conservative south or he's actually a living contradiction.
Keep speaking the truth ❤
When we break free they hate us...when we agree they Break us...but when we have enough of them....they want to Kill us...... one Circle at a time.

Trump produce buena música, lástima que solo sea el otro lado del mismo sistema. Acá esperando que sus jefes reptiles eleven su vibración ya que se la pasan en el 3D.
I love the heavy guitar 🎸
Thank you Tom vote Trump for lower prices at the pump😎🤟💚
But why is he throwing up Freemason hand signs in his video? Makes me wonder who's side he truly is on
I really like the effects in this video! The sculls in like a vacuum around him on the pile is really cool 😎
Not a rap fan but a Tom fan to just hear the poetry of info he throws out. It was great to hear those grinding riffs in the back for us metal heads.
Love the message, and love the guitar
You act like everybody wants to be a musician 😅
Shit slams so hard
That's dope Tom,
Are you coming to the UK Scotland love you're music letting everyone I know hear you
#LetsStartARiot
Love this song and everything you Nova do ❤️
I was listening to you in my car jamming. Everyone at work asked who I was listening to and now they're listening too. Keep doing what you do Tom.
You found why you were born! 🥰Keep keeping them woke! 🥰
Tom, buddy. I dig a lot of what you do. But let's be honest, we need something from you that is something you can play in a club, a song that's catchy af between the lyrics and the beat! I like what you do. But tbh, a lot of it is kind of like "Ranting to a Beat"   It has its place... But! One goal you should have, is to hear people blasting your music as they drive by! A lot of your stuff is not a song you can get down to.    WE have to be able to relate with the song, we realize you like writing about your experiences. But one thing that makes a great Artist, is being able to relate with the lyrics! Like NF! He's spitting hard truth about folks who deal with Depression and darkness, yet hype them up and give them a way to release! Eminem has his Curtain call Album that had so many iconic songs that were just catchy af or so motivating!    We honestly haven't had that from you, to be fair.   How many times have u gone to a party and heard your music my man? Like I said, you've done something great and your independent, but I also believe that you stand alone... The Greats get views constantly! Not just when it's Trending on week one.... I know you have it in you! I know Nova can make it a sick ass video! We all are frustrated with the government the politics the division etc etc. It can be about what we are all dealing with. But it needs to be a catchy tune great beat and bomb ass lyrics! Let it be one of a kind! A song we can all blast and bang to.   You have to realize, there's a good amount of your music. That has parts in it where you are basically talking over a beat. Imagine someone playing their system loud af, then a guy just starts talking. That's kind of equivalent to banging to a killer Rap song on your system and then it cuts to commercial because it's a radio station. What happens? We turn it down like fuck fuck fuck! Lol I know I'm being really negative, but just know. I'm doing it because I know your potential and I know this will light the fire in your eyes and end up giving us all one big SURPRISE!! It's tough love brotha! I wish u nothing but the best! We all been patiently waiting for something great from you! IT'S BEEN AWHILE MY GUY! Peace out Homie!✌️💯
Im a 55 year old mom of many. Grandma to many. And i love Tom, Nova and the crew.  Im not a hip hop music listener but i listen to his and branched out to others that have the same stories to tell just in different genres  and they are all good.
Timeless music with conscious message. ART.
Heil Tom, Greetings from Germany, keep on ure work, the good will be blessed.. Keep on speaking the truth these criminals... Hope JouTube won't quit you!  Alles Gute für Dich!  Grüße, Richard
This video and your look would look great in a Mortal Kombat game
My theme song everyday at work!!  I love what all your family does for me daily!!!!!!!!!!
Tom and Nova...the dynamic duo

Done real great. Keep up the good music u make.

👊🙏😌
Thanks bro you and Nova 😎🤟😈❤️‍🔥
Keep spitting the truth!!
A few days ago I was a swedish mother looking for rap on line. I’m a Bob Dylan/ Joni Mitchell kind of a girl, but I was so so tired of the gangster lyrics my sons was listening to. And I found you. Now I’m a rap fan in the hog fam doing my best to show my boys a better way of thinking. Thank you Tom.
This song hits hard
Sounds like a rip off of a peep song and trying to figure out that other verse sounds like a familer flow as well.. praying to the sky-peep . In your thong, smoking strong outa bong.
God Bless Tom
Love this! ❤️
I haven't heard any of your music that I don't love!!! ❤️🧡💛 I'm 63 yrs young ❤️

This would snap if the content was better...too political yawn
Why so quite?

Tom is the 🐐
Hey Tom I beat the algorithm buddy,   I found a way to completely remove the filters and say what you please about anything! All you gotta do is say it happens in 3022!

Tom Macdonald should be the leader of this country. I'd follow this man to hell and back .
obligatory 'i dont like rap but i like this' or 'im an old white man' comment
Put you 6 feet deep, that's an underground rapper. One of the hardest bars of 2022.

Literally the only rapper I give a shit about. Sick em', Tom. 🤘
👊👊👊👊👊
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
For a an who allegedly preaches peace and seems to expose the wrong doings of this world, sure looks like he's basing his image around something ungodly and very ominous. It seems Tom is another Trump controlled op front man pushing transhumanism. Nobody gets to produce this level of production, fame and fortune going against the narrative. Ephesians 6:12
Love this so much! 🤘🤘
👏
Yess tommo
BANGER!!!!
Fuckin Macdonald happy meal 😂,pig fuck ,going to hell in flames
Pure fire 🔥
Can you show us a reaction to your favorite YouTube reactor to your videos that would be awesome as well! Love what you do it is inspiring to be a sober and better person then we were before. Because that is a beast the world isn't ready for!
This one's kinda growing on Me tho
THIS GUY IS A  MESSENGER... IN YOUR FACE
You are in complete control and it’s fuckin awesome!
I sure will u nailed it
Tom at it again! 🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️
Song makes no sense lmfao. Like all of his shit, jumping from point A to point X, to 1, to blue, to apple
That Guitar is Nasty AF absolutely makes the song #Tomisuntouchable
I love this sound and music Tom, it’s a “Riot” so exciting. Hope in the future you can work with a rock band and maybe make a cool collab with something like this. Heck, I’ll take this but with more lyrics from the band. 👍
3.3 million subs and 3.3 mill views atm

Awesome vid man!
Damn, I'm sorry for the typo.   I know its.....MacDonald.
Old McDonald had a fan.   Actually a ton of them.   I'm proud to be one of them.   Today's video drop was  smokin' hot.   I loved it.   Thanks to both of you.   I've already passed it along.
omg... no wonder why i love my hair so much... watching you with it for the past 2 years and the only different thing is... i still have hair on my sides x) love your mentality, we'll change the world ! :)
T-Mac is the love child of Machine Gun Kelly & Lil Wayne 🤣
Looking forward to the eventual Tom/Kanye track that is going to break the world 🤘🤘
Sheeple are soon starting a Riot!
Where's the new video at bro? It's Friday! I'm so excited.
Well seeing as your comments have been turned off on your new video "sheeple" I guess Ill leave my comment hear. Sheeple is a bad ass song and Im going to have it on repeat all day
9 am wheres the new viddy
come on tom drop the new track
WOW! I just found your music. I am a 50 year old Asian red blooded American. I few up listening to 80’s rap and now refuse to listen to todays garbage rap. But your lyrics and style are above the rest. WOW! I respect your lyrics and your music is the best rap out there.
I want those glasses. Love the vids.
A5r
This shit is snub backwards
Ehh Tom..it's incredible reading the comments and seeing how many generations and age groups your music empowers and speaks to.. ever since I was introduced to your music 3 years ago or more now I've loved it blunt truth that so many are afraid to hear and speak of.  Keep on pushing it out we all need it..looking forward to sheeple
My dude speaking all of our hearts
Yea so when I was a kid the Kottonmouth Kings got it done with the song suburban life this is an emphasis on that  beat so I will beat it to death just like I did suburban life🎉🎉🎉 I’m 41 suburban life was 1997 to 1989
Upside down cross on his ski mask and x on his forehead. Sadly Tom is showing himself as the Biblical true definition of a fool. He who denies Jesus Christ as Lord
Nice
Check out kvoncomedy where he shows conservative on dr phil show. Braids come from nordic culture. Dutch braid. Ha!! Ironic. Great lyrics as always
hi Tom MacDonald  I love your videos
Shouts from the UK my boy......keep it up
Damn u hit this out the park !
😍 Brilliant as usual! Love from Janey in Devon England 😘❤️💜
I must say, I typically hate rap and hip hop but man, I listen to your music regularly cuz I enjoy the themes and the fact that you aren’t afraid to stand up against the mainstream. Keep killing it dude
Start covering some stuff from your home country would ya. Lol
Please leave the communist state of California.    I gritted my teeth to buy the six pack of albums, knowing I was giving to you, but also giving to the anti-American state via your business tax/income tax etc.
Good job
Where is the new video!
The most ironic part is seeing the political propaganda ads that Youtube puts on your videos. HA
Jesus loves you, Tom!
i wanna see nightmare on elm street theme for and rap for october. who wants to see that😳😳😳
I have discovered Tom McDonald! And I feel like I have been reborn! Also, Inhave been! I am 32 and was Baptized in the lake! Let me say, these lyrics in all of your music get me right in the chill bumps man! As an 89 baby I grew up with the real Slim Shady, b rabbit the one and only Eminem. As I said though, I have been reborn and so has Eminem! But better! I mean, I kicked the addiction of opioids 4 years ago now, drugs was that old dead life, politics and LIFE are what interest me now! Your lyrics are perfect not to mention you’re INDEPENDENT and look at what you have created! Keep on keep on because I am here for all of it! 🇨🇦
I dont think any other youtuber gets the same amount of views as they have subscribers. Tom is awesome and rocking it💜💜💜
Hey man I known  you may not have time to get back to me but I love this song good job  man and keep it up I'll a fan.
YES! LOVE IT!
Need the discord address / invite for Tom. I had to erase the app and start from the beginning and I lost everything. Please somebody help me
Break 30 million views next video
Another hit ❤️
Tycho  Brahe was the first man to see everything from above. As he started looking at the stars above him. Mysteriasly as it was. From the day Tycho Brahe was the first man to look up against the stars, and ment that he had something to say. Was mystiriasly haunted by accidents everywhere,  He went. A day in Denmark, were one man is hunted by accidents today we all that a Tycho Brahe day. Can you spot the pattern?
Love ya tom. Keep it coming. Ur bro dabo
Hi Tom I'm 45 years old and I listen to your music all the time I like your lyrics have a good one
hi Tom MacDonald reber when you  gave me a  shawty out I am your begestfan
Best use of crickets ... Ever
Love love mad respect 🙏
Used to fuck with this guy heavy until he linked up with Adamb Calhoun tol is talented but cmon y lower himself to that country trash rap
Speak it Tom macdonald Yeah.......🤟
I just figured it out. This guy is like a shitty mixture of Riff Raff and Hopsin
37. Been waiting a long time for someone to rap the truth and do it well. You're our modern version of Tupac
the possession of Tom Macdonald . It's a process.
You hate this generation so much compared to yours (per your twitter video) but yet you are trying so hard to make music like today's generation?   Lmaoooooooo why bro????   This shit sucks. Today's music is trash. You should make music like your generation, and then it will potentially be good. No need to sell out just to sound popular and get clicks.
SIX FEET DEEP THATS A UNDERGROUND RAPPER   AHHH FCK YES TOM!!! thanks nova &team ❤❤❤
Nova is killing the visually stunning work. Bravo. Nice work.
I think Tom knows just what he's writing/singing against. May the white God bless you
Straight Fire Brotha. Thank you and the HOG Family for spitting Truth.
I love this guy, over and over.
No one knows your name that’s why you always gotta name drop.  He just drop kicked every rapper in the jaw.  Thay can’t say shiiii.
Your awesome!
This is my favorite song of you tom
Love him so much his music changed my life
I’m gone Riot if ppl dont respect
We need Tom and Samson!!!! Collab!!!

Love the music! :)
This Gma loves some Tom!
Gay face ? Tom really.  Stick to what you actually know and have full knowledge of man. Now I can post your image with gay face at a pride parade.. if I went. Honestly though I don’t go they made a mockery of the whole thing like all other issues. Standing for one’s own issue these days just gets made into a political game or joke in culture. No one’s safe anymore. Or has the respect from the right people. As you keep proving and providing to the idiots of the world. But honestly I think your making it worse sometimes. What do you personally stand for… what does anyone stand for… likes? Views on a platform.. no serious. When everything made a joke not just by you then how do we improve societies. Discriminate everyone and everything. Make a joke of all issues that the ones making have no clue about.  Honestly makes me so confused on you. I’m by no means asking for a song made about this. But real truth. That’s where you’ll shine best if trying to make any points in todays EFD UP world. Not sure what’s been worse for me. Having the shit kicked out of me and hospitalized for being who I am or watching you do the same thing to anyone else like me who’s just trying to live. And survive this bully planet. Sigh. Disappointment never ceases. Appreciate your hard work to make people feel lower about them selves.

Grizzy diss??
Damn the beat sick asaf in this one man.
My man you went off on this one
found you life and algorithm hid you found you again..... damn miss this motivation. happy I was reminded. true woke or true knowledge is the power.not the bs they want you to follow.... the ads they are playing while I'm typing due me not able to stop while adding a comment drives me nut
I want to hear this man with a metal drummer. Dave Lombardo would be wet dream.
I don't understand why it's so hard for me to just make a comment without picking one of your videos I hate that part sucks I just want to say something to you and I know you get a lot but damn dog I do a video do a song a collaboration with j Cole all that be hard as s*** that that would actually be hard as s*** like I would love to see that that would blow my mind and I still got to save up a little bit but I'm going to get one of them autographed riot you're my favorite rapper like you're great when you didn't don't look down holy s*** that is rapping for real that's what made me change everything like I've loved you I've never fanboyed my life but if I've ever met you yeah yeah that'd probably happen and I've never I've met a lot of celebrities that would just I would not hold my composure I'd flip out I mean like a 13 year old girl that's crazy because I've never had anybody in my life have that much influence on me you great I would love to meet you that'd be great that would lose my s*** and I'm sorry for at least 15 minutes after that I'd calm down but the first 15 I wouldn't know how to act
Awesome video and awesome message. I want more!
Why is there an upside down cross on ur mask ?
I’m not a rap fan but I’m a huge truth fan so ima huge Tom Fan.
This one seems to reminisce with   "The Way I Am" (EMINEM REMIX)
❤. Keep it up
God made that possible
Did he say he hate pac
Bruh I got called racist cause I listen 2 u
Bang...
Hey brother are you ever going to have a concert in Oklahoma? Thanks for making the best music with the best messages I've ever heard in my life!
"Bad ass" inverted cross bro... letting it creepy in eh?
Even your idols and music Gods will now FINALLY!!!! say this shit is fucked… yet you still only bang your head to the damn beats… still can’t see that all the “numbing” you did, really did you in indefinitely… huh? (You know who you are as does everyone else) you’re on the wrong damn side of the spectrum and you will be left to the slaughter if you do not look around and see where you are headed… or continue to defend a fake image because you couldn’t help but evolve your existence around deceit and false advertising… it’s hard to rip that bandaid off, I know… but it is a must.. Only two choices at this point of reality… become truth. Or stay a lie. Either way you will not stop the inevitable..
Remember all your fans that were here cuz your music was raw? well we're back for this.
You're awesome you don't have not one song that I don't like I can't say that about anyone else. You make me think of my own feeling and thoughts. The hell with a handshake if I met you I'd give you a hug like the rest of my homies.
Even if I never make a dollar again… da da da I’m bless.  I love it
I wonder if he can sign/rightslash write something with kanye with all his stuff going on
Bro, you're my hero!! Keep going my man!!
Nice diss. Fuck grizzly. Haven't even heard of dude until like 2 days ago. Mf said he in the box with dax as well even tho that man rapped for 20 minutes straight
The heavy guitar!!!  You speak the truth!!!!
Hell. Yeah. I love it when you step toe to toe. Riot on, luv. You #KNOW I will.
“Put you six feet deep that’s an underground rapper “…..BARS 🔥
did he jus say on Crip?
Your videos are just so amazing! Love the music! Keep it up!
Lowest rater rapper out of 2,000 by user ratings. Annoying Orange being rated higher. Why the fuck are you guys supporting this garbage???
Nice music thanks from IRAN
Yo Tom I don't know if you've seen it yet I'm one of your songs you can stand with black people without making donations to a corporation I don't know if you've heard of Candace Owens but BLM is in for it it's coming crashing down my man
Tom. Please stop dissing your blood. No humans are "trash". I will listen to anything you have to say but you seriously need to stop hunting people. Please. I promise that we are trying to help you. Stop the hate brother. Up to you.
what happen to  man bye
Funny Eminem led me two rappers like dax hop and Tom and Tom n nova are killing it reason tom and nova Keeping it real
Yep we are all blessed
Sunday riot.
Gonna put it here because I think Tom might be the only artist that gives a fuck, but what does it take to contribute to subtitles or captioning? I have severe hearing problems where I can't necessarily understand what's being said. I've learned to read lips as context, but that doesn't work 100% of the time. Captions would save most of Youtube for me, and probably help millions of others, so I don't know what needs done to move the needle forward. You used to be able to submit cc requests, but I haven't seen it in a minute.
I’m a 127 year old man from Arkansas and ever since my father showed me your music I’ve been lovin it. As a black man the message really resonated with me and I love the rlly catchy choruses with sweat vocals. I also love that there are no corny bar’s whatsoever. Also I love that you don’t use a political message to get money and from dumb fans.
so true
Screw mainstream everything. This song is the shit bro. Keep shuttin'em down man
Yea it's dope.. but Calhoun will always be better! #acal #gumbo
So ummm everyone seems to be having concerts have you thought about ever having one... maybe you could preform at my house party. I would be the coolest kid in town
Hey Tom! I love many of your videos! 💙Even if I don’t agree about somethings 😃
Tom is a modern day prophet... Also props to Nova for the visual art 😍
Rizzy a burnt piece of toast from this song!! Dude ain't got NOTHING on Tom!! ... Why so quiet Rizzy the queen
Tom MacDonald you're a fucking dope person and you speak facts about the world society and all of your songs bro, but much love too you bro you're amazing guy.

Pure fire. "Put you 6 feet deep that's an underground rapper." I had to rewind and listen to that a few times. Damn. Keep it up!!!
Fuck…. This is so good
I have never been a fan of rap music but Tom is the real deal! It's about time someone stood up and said what we are all thinking. God bless you Tom. You have a new 57 year old fan!
so is this slipknot 2022?
Oh no! What happened to Ronald Mcdonald :(
The new Eminem
Dear gawd I love the crunching riffs in this...just...ooooooooh!   Dang skippy it's a banger!!
👊
Queen of hearts has ALL SPADES
WHO IS THE CLOWN MACDONALD???
YOU SO QUIET THOMAS J E.  I WILL SCREAM IT.  DARE ME.
ARE YOU BLESSED???????
The goat, every song he has could top main charts. Blows my mind everything you make is a hit when mainstream struggles to produce a handful.
As a 50 yr old woman who grew up listening to beasties, wu tang, public enemy and Em....you are now my top dog. Your stuff is real, banging and your videos are stellar! Love, Bubbles 😎
Dude this would totally make an awesome UFC or Pro Wrestling entrance theme song as well as your Whiteboyz.
GENERIC WHITE PERSON TOM MCDONALD FAN BOY COMMENT: I’m a 89 year old white grandma who hates rap but loves your hippity hop music. Let’s go trump!  🙄🙄

But don't act like you care about all these people if you can't speak what's in your Heart. You Trust God or hate him.? Huh.? They gonna kill me huh. Nah. You exactly where .... Want you. Keep it up kid.

What happened to let it rain on Spotify ? That song was a banger
Besides all the other song references

1 word Realism
I am 32 and I’ve been listening to you since 2019
Brilliant!  Love it.  <3
EVERYDAY IS FRIDAY!!! 😢I hope “they” figure it out and fight their way out. ❤

Point on man ,tell it like it is!
your  in beast mode those guitar riffs are heavy why did dude even git up for Tom to knock him down
good job on all you do, loving God and the red, white and blue.
cant lie he fell of
Hey Tom….run for president we need you. You may not think you could win but America needs you we need you man we need you as the face of the nation making the necessary changes you rap about man….think about it
This one was one of your best I mean please be this guy I like you better you can feel the epic not the message we know you by now I want you to evolve almost gave up on you
That was dope.
#1 Tom McDonald  yessir!!
Tom you rock, keep up the good work, Nova does great work on your vids, please dont stop. The world needs your voice!
I do enjoy knowing that the skull mountain is actually a poop mountain lol
not sure if you saw but Ivan Moody from Five Finger Death Punch is a fan
pretty sure you don't tour but would love to see you live at least once!
Yo tom I think that you and Tech N9ne would be able to make an amazing song
Shiiiiiit hog, the graphics. Miss nova you are FIYAH!
Dude you are the best rapper ever existed I swear no body had anything on you
Wow 😮❤
I’m just a dorky blind girl who raises chicken cattle and Yorkshire terriers but at the end of the day you sir are the baddest motherfucker who has ever spit words I have nothing but love and that’s all you deserve
Rhyming 50 years of right wing propaganda is not art. Especially from a clown
garbage.......holy fuck.....this seriously sucks
I’ve always been a rock/metal fan. Like old school country. Some rap. Most of it I didn’t care for because it was all about “bitches and hoes”. The messages of Iced Tea, Tupac, Ice Cube etc were lost to the almighty dollar and Gucci. I have to say, it’s been a long time that I’ve been blown away by a new artist. Especially a rap one. You’re saying exactly what a lot of people have been thinking but were too scared or chickenshit to say. It’s about time someone said something that has impact on young people. Keep doing what you’re doing. Don’t let anyone shut you up!
Been away from listening to your kick ass music man;had some mental issues to deal with. I'm grounded again and back to you. Keep up man...FUCK THE NEW WORLD ORDER!!!
A friend just emailed me the link to this Fantastic! Tell 'em like it is. 👍 🤘🤟
Dope as always man keep pushing out dopppee!!! Music I’m your #1 fan!!!
@TomMacDonald Keep it up and provide TRUTH .......Thank you Tom
Is that an upside down cross on your mask Tom?
Keep rapping about the truth so people understand what our country is doing . The truth hurts
is tom being sencored by any means....havent seen or heard a thing for 3 weeks now.....south africa...
I used 2 know a guy Frank Romano that played this dope shit. We were going to be bestys then he forgot about me
Your the best in the game dawg you got me through some tough times I got hit by a car and I never gave up cause of you and your music thanks bro
People out here really listen to this lol....sounds like auto tunes bs...he said everywhere I go there a riot....why so quiet?....here we have a confused Canadian....this is not rap...this is what's destroying the rap community....uneducated rappers that just throw lame bars together to make a profit and say they killers and got good bars....and no I don't listen to fuckin 69 or some lame ass rappers that b mumble shit I'm talkin Wayne Nas 50 mm...these real rappers...I guess this is just the new erratic era of music the next gen gotta listen to
Better diss track than the one you did for lethal you proper killed it mate nice one so needs more exposure someway push for a tv broadcast just 1 you will smash the big guns i reckon
No comments on names, did he reuse the whiteboy beat on that track?
I'm here listening 🎧🎶 for the first time. Because Tom Macdonald asked me very nicely 😎😂
Hey Tom I was wondering if it would be cool if I could use your music in the background of my YouTube  ideos
Amazing 💯🔭
We Love u Tom!!🖤🖤♥️♥️
BEAST!!!!!!
Every time I want to listen to an great song I come here to listen to the newest thing tom has done. It reminds me how bad music can be and the song I want to listen to is so much more satisfying next to this swill
your music is awesome
Hell Yeah This Kicks
Video and track are absolutely bad ass. Love the fact an independent musician is completely defying the main stream scene and producing solid content consistently. Been stuck on Tom's music on spotify for a solid month, and I mainly listen to metal...
This is so fire 🔥🔥 officially my new favorite song!!
When will u post again
Another straight fire ass track from the mother fuckin realest lyricist out there. Fuck the main streams I'm about that independent underground shockwave you putting out.
I stopped listening rap since Tupac die, now I listen to you, I love you brother keep doing what you do don't stop and don't look down 💯
I wish you would come to MAINE!! MAINEiacs would love it if you did!!
Bro I don't even like rap and with that said let me get to the ass. you speak the truth and I admire that and respect is your achievement.
Tom, my brother. I have never been a rap guy. But I fucking love you man. Keep soaking truth brother.
That’s fire. 6’ under bar was bad ass. Just discovered you today. Discovered you by a small video about bill gates. Man we think the same. Best artist of I’ve heard all year
The legend salute from I Macklaw X
Hi Tom, love your music/messages. I also love how you reach out to those discovering your messages … so I’d like to bring to your attention Queen B Reacts here on YT. Just recently she did a reaction to one of your songs, and it started her on the road of discovering truth. I’m in love watching her journey, as her eyes and heart open. I know you’re busy, but you might take a moment to see her, you won’t be disappointed. It’s like watching a baby take it’s first steps ❤
🚨🚨🚨🚨✌🏼🌈🇨🇦 SOS ELIJAH, TOM MACDONALD AND NOVA I LOVE YOU SO MUCH, YOU HELPED KEEP ME ALIVE THIS WHOLE TIME AND I JUST WANNA FAN GIRL YOU!!!!   UNITED WE STAND, ON GOD’S AUTHORITY, AND HE LOVES YOU ALL 🙏🇨🇦❤️✌🏼🌈🇺🇸🙏✌🏼🌈🇺🇸❤️🇨🇦
Love it Tom! Love your truthful lyrics! GOD bless All you Are brother!!!
That beat sick AF, but this dude lyrics are garbage. He a artist, a rapper... not a singer? Vin Jay better lyrically as far as New rappers go. As far as singers go Maika is the best singer.  Vin Jay- King of the Jungle  Maika- Different
Your people carry you....one day mine will do the same with me.......TaruAmara5032.
Let’s start a riot that was dope 💯💪💪💪🫡🫡🫡🫡
Hog life in hog family .....i love it make riot whit you
I've been rocking with you for quite a while, Tom. I completely appreciate the message of unity and togetherness that you try to portray in your music. That being said, this song may damn well be my favorite that I've ever heard from you! The music mix is beautiful and eerie....even haunting. The lyrics are perfect. Big shout out to Jared for the VFX work! All around man, this is 🔥🔥🔥🔥. I was already a big fan but you are quickly climbing the ladder to my "Favorite Artists of All Time" list. Much respect, keep it up! #HOG
P    8th n
Hardest beat you’ve made
I know you ain't trying to hear this but by the end of the year my goal is to meet you make a song with you my brother but I can call you brother you'll see why if you take your chance on me and share the same values in the same heart and we speak about nothing but what we lived and the truth watch and see truth prevail the day I shake your hand and meet you my son loves you music it's amazing cuz he's the one that introduce me to your music I grew up with no dad on the Tupac CD so until then my brother blessings keep doing what you doing
love it
Tom another great video ! Nova you are amazing!!! You both have so much talent ❤
Yeah needed  that one
Thanks for the motivation Tom! Fire!
Your stuff don't rhyme.
BANHAMMER ENGAGED BIOTCH
Bro I feel like I’m alone listening to your music, but you know what I don’t give a f.  My entire teenage life up until now I’m called a conspiracy theorist!  Even though I’m talking fact I get made fun off and ignored, but through you Tom I have a voice !!!!
Wana make another few mill cash? Sell booze! Tom's vodka Tom's whiskey you get the point. Enjoy
Unbelievable that you and nova make these videos, the level of talent between you two is insane
Beautiful hard work.  You and your team are leaders.
Stay safe and healthy out there doing whatever you are doing.
Been in a lot of music genres, but Tom MacDonald hits harder than anything from reaggae to deathcore that ive ever listened to. Facts without giving a fuck. Cant be more metal than that
Trash
Good stuff
Tom, I don't even like rap music, but I love what you do. I bought this song from Amazon because I love what you preach.
🍑🔥🔥🍑
If you feel so empty So used up, so let down If you feel so angry So ripped off, so stepped on You're not the only one Refusing to back down You're not the only one So get up
DUDE STOP CUTTING OUT THE FUCKING CURSE WORDS THAT SHIT KILLS IT.
Let's start a riot
... notifications are busted... Again! 🤬  Nova rocked it outta the park again and no one can match your lyrics 😁👍 #100%talent #HangoverGang
A man that loves all and speaks for all.  Not the sick. O honey if your gay and have disconnected.  We are gay and we at least get the basics of free for humanity.
Nova did a damn good job on these edits man!! This song is Fire fr!!🔥🔥🔥
So shadowbaned like a mother f her.
"Put you 6 feet under thats an underground rapper" love that
I remember a year or so ago ppl were really hating on this guy. But damn is his music entertaining
Good job Tom
Facts.
This is FIRE!🔥🔥🔥
I tune in every time for the message. You guys do some impressive stuff on your own, insane amount of work without a label behind you
Love this song awesome  fire!! #hog forever..
I’m amazed at how cool the video is.
Keep talking Tom!! We listening!!
Still my favorite song !
Finally, rap I can relate to.
This style of entertainment was something that came way after my time, but you have a message.
I like the background ambience combined with the guitar sample/riff in the verse.
I hate the way this guy looks, I'm sure he does it for shock value or whatever. At least his music is good.  Just wish he didnt look like the king of the ICP fan club
Thanks for keeping it real bro. Never bend the knee and I will be a fan for life.
January 6th 2021

I'm a big fan
My 12 year old daughter knows most all your songs. I have ZERO issue with this.   I would however have an issue with her listening to the majority of mainstream music. And as I just asked her her favorite song is snowflake. Also as a little context I have never liked rap hip hop or pop I'm a metal head but you sir are on a different level. Keep making amazing content thank content thank you so much.
This sounds good it's what they called real hip hop
Put you six feet deep that’s a underground rapper 🤯🔥👀
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👀🤯
🙏🙏🙏🙏
Fascist tears from Tom
Your ability to put words together doesn't make you right.  Trumps a modern-day carpet bagger and you in all your finite wisdom has fallen for it
You have a perfect way of writing songs and putting lyrics together to express things if we are to pull more people together think about doing double triple genres and getting your opinions and words out with some of these players not to say go mainstream just affecting ways in another way just my opinion but I know you do it your way and I love you for that
Hey Tom I got to say this it would be very very cool if you did a song with kid rock or Collin Raye hint hint I love both those guys and they know how to do music and so do you it would be freaking amazing for you guys to put something together that just trips the world out I know you can do it I love you brother keep up the good work
Your the only man I know close to be really woke. I would marry you and blow your woke reality.
Tom I was looking for your content on Rumble and could not find it. What is your channel name on Rumble. HOG Forever
Love this one it’s 🔥 🔥
Urgent... Are you doing a sweepstakes? Someone pushing for folks to register.
I like this real shit that you produce, you are the fucking man and we are on the same level of thinking, the whole world's society is fucked up its rediculas and we are ruled by rich morons. Keep it real my man 💪
"U need 2 do tour Cincinnati waiting ML Stay Blessed 🤘🤘 WB. 2.0 One Love 🤘
He just keeps getting better and bette
Hello Tom, I am 57 years old and just love your music. I love how real you are and it feels like you are trying to save a broken world. There is not one song that doesn't speak to me or makes feel alive. And you have no clue how much sanity you bring to me every time I listen to your music. And it matters on so many levels. I have stage 5 CKD and not always doing well. Last September 27th my mother died. My husband had to quit his job to take care of me doing dialysis, cooking and cleaning for I am so weak now. How the government only gives me a small amount of disability and it isn't even enough to pay the rent. The struggle is real and so depressing. My fight just to live with this disease that is destroying my body is so difficult. I would support you, I love your music, but can't afford your albums. I adore the names jumpsuit and believe me I would buy that and all your alums. Do not give up your truth songs. The world needs Tom MacDonald even if they don't know it. Nova.. You are pure gold in your creations of videos. I am simply blown away with each one. A real gold star artist. Thank you both from the deepest depths of my heart. An old grandma fan....
Sharing already, I could be your Latina mom, anytime, you should be very proud of yourself and Nova, your strenght,  brilliance,hard work and determination to bring truth, continue with your humility that is taking you to see the deceit, the pain of many, and to speak about it. Wow, Wow, the true powerful message for a time like this. This generation is so hypnotized, and desincetized, so sad to see...this is the strong message needed to caught their attention, and also the attention of the whole world. God bless you!!❤🙏
VIDEO AND FX R SICK ON THIS ONE!!
I’m seventy years old , tired of this new age of “peace and harmony “ that didn’t come under the new world order and it’s just begun. This man sees it . 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Ok this is fire bro like fr
Much love Tom and Nova from a fellow Canadian. Loza Alexander's Freedom Convoy Anthem  is a powerful tribute to our Truckers and call to arms for all the peace loving patriots worldwide.  I would love to see a collaboration with Loza. H.O.G. meets Loza Train would be unstoppable!
Tom I just wanted to say plz keep making great music. My 13 Year old stepson loves you and so do me and my wife.
OPAF!!!
Loving this metal rap
I love this song Tom
Tom... keep getting telegrams from "you"... I don't believe it's true. Don't fall for it people. Sending love and positive healing energy to all 🥰
1 million views a week fukin beast 💪
I just discovered Tom and I cant stop hearing his songs thank you Tom you have helped me see that I am more then my depression and anxiety #hangovergang
Did you see that weed has animal faces yet?? Animal spirit guides!! From God! Started when the purpl sky started to follow the sunsets! I'm always walking my dog then. I think I'm the only one seen it!! Spirit guides. Take pics of buds!! You'll see!! No Monsanto weed though.  Definitely not spirit guides.  Tis the opposite.  Genisis 111,, Grow the grass seed the herb one that makes the seeds! Because it's the hy spirit you put on your spirit eye and the jumanji the antichrist leading you back down .
<3
Sunday riot except for Bill Gates.
Not sure which to put  post. The short I have respect on shorts you did. I compare to rats they travel in packs when food is plenty but when no food they eat each over. If we do not come together & drop the liberal and conservative & work as one to take control & make USA a country it is never going to make it. When election comes do no vote for trump or Biden. The new ones should run on getting USA back. Trump will not do it & Biden will not be voted for anyway. If you post something new will comment there too as think i important. Again I loved the short!!
Even if I never made a dollar again, I'm blessed Never stop giving 'em bops, white 'Pac in the flesh, oh yes Shovel rocks on my coffin, call the cops if I'm dead, no stress Hundred thousand fans coming to cut off your head, slow death Most illest singer, both middle fingers, throw 'em in the air I don't care 'til I'm a ghost or I'm crippled I ain't gon' chill, homie, sit down I am still the biggest, who the bitch now? I am independent, you are bitter and pathetic When it's up, then it's up, then it's up, come and get down Everywhere I go's a riot, people crying Everywhere you go is silent, why so quiet? I show up and it's a riot, they excited And where you go ain't nothing like it, why so quiet? Even if I never made a dollar again, I'm blessed Never stop giving 'em bops, white 'Pac in the flesh, oh yes 'Til I'm dead, I swear to God I'll do it my way Grinding out my life, now every day is Friday Independent legend, unheard of at my age Middle finger flipping, got scribbles on my face I will not go mainstream, dawg, you know I hate pop I'll be screaming, "Fuck the industry", until my veins pop That's a fake watch, your whole gang ops, ain't the same, stop No one knows your name, that's why you always gotta name-drop Most illest singer, both middle fingers, throw 'em in the air I don't care 'til I'm a ghost or I'm crippled I ain't gon' chill, homie, what now? I am still the biggest, sit the fuck down I am on the independent Mount Rushmore You're a fucking nobody, a legit clown Everywhere I go's a riot, people crying Everywhere you go is silent, why so quiet? I show up and it's a riot, they excited And where you go ain't nothing like it, why so quiet? I only do dope shit, so sick, homie, why you capping? I'm a popstar, rockstar, you a never-has-been I do big things, wrist bling, you don't want this action Put you six feet deep, that's a underground rapper Everywhere I go's a riot, people crying Everywhere you go is silent, why so quiet? I show up and it's a riot, they excited And where you go ain't nothing like it, why so quiet?

Crouched Tom on the pile of skeletons is certifiably one of the hardest images recorded in the history of man.
I like being a clown they think I'm funny...... they are quite because they are actually listening???...
I hope President Trump starts playing this song at all of his rallies etc..!!! Fire as always Mr. McDonald!
Don't care how many of my old friends see my comment. Weird how ur music is always the timing of my life also. Wtf man.
So subtle but in his face... 👋 lol nice job.
Hey Tom can you message me
I would love to see you perform a new uplifting song at President Trumps upcoming Inauguration that would be epic... someone new with a strong message.
El Tomas , My ESE!

Hey Tom I just got a copyright for using this song on one of my videos are you still allowing us to use your Music to make videos
What the hog tattoo mean

Bro? I saw a a video and even in your videos you say you ain't going mainstream. I just now thought,hmmm, I wonder if he's on Spotify? Yup! What's up with that? How's that independent? Tell us how much you make from them if money is so not important. This will cure my dismay. Or maybe I'm just confused.
if your minstream and you wanna hit the underground scene holler at TOM !
Let’s riot, come on guys let’s get him to number one

The truth will always speak

Saturday riot.
Thank you!!  You saved my life
Hello tom.Im ur old fan from Iran. This days we r fighting for our rights and lives in the street.Islamic goverment is killing people. Many old, young and even teenagers got shot by police.

Tom McDonald has some bars E-I-E-I-O
This this so hard🔥🔥🔥🔥
I'm 51 and an avid rap listener,I mean come on,it's the time in life when I grew up. I was their when rap first started. It's has grown so much. Rip Coolio,first rapper I ever saw live in Portland Oregon. Rip Tupac. I like Tom's music. It's straight to the point. No bullshit that mainstream wants these other idiots to say in their songs. Blah blah blah. Tom? Please never do an American music awards or any of the sort. Does the money really matter?
Bro this shit is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥Tom going hard right here💯💪
They unchecked my subscription.... Just so you know....🤬🤬🤬🤬
The first official banger of October before October even drops lol

I feel bad for those without subwoofers. This song kicks hard
Much love ❤️
Whooo Hooo!!! Boom! Dropped a good one!! Tom you rule. F-ck the idiots!!
We need tour soon and collab with @Upchuch
Brother, never stop.
FREAKIN SLAY .. I'm a huge fan of early 90s metal and I spent much of the 90s chasing bands like rage against the machine , I actually followed Pantera and tool .. Hed PE and clutch were also some of my favs. ... My Dad is a BIG pink Floyd and black Sabbath and Rush fan so theres that ( love them ) So I guess it's safe to say may days of mixed skate music, pistols , Suicidal tendencies ( let's face it  Trujillo is just so sick on the thumps ) even The Melvins.. gave way to what the 90s had to offer And I started calming down a little. All in all my love for all genras begun to change and I slowly but surely hit up some rap. TRIBE CALLED QUEST,   fell into some old NWA.  Really dug some Mos Def... but rap never really got me. I'm digging the hell out of you Tom and Novah .. the talent originality and relevant poetry has got my attention. SPOKEN WORD WITH A KILLER BEAT AND Power grind riff.. 💪 Guess my musically journey knows no boundaries and to group you in should be a compliment! You tell the story of EVERYONE and apologize not for it and the fact you're independent is ... FIRE
Well done#Bossman
You are a true jester! not for the king, for all of us! that i love sir! please keep going on.:)
I'm one of your oldest as in age fans I have not been able to stop listening  to this song!  Tom you are my savviour  because my baby girl who has been here since she was 12 years old is being deported back to Ireland even though she has nothing to go back too.  Please as an outsider your words are so power please help she's in immigration prison right now and I don't know of you will even see this
Shot at icp?
White pac in the flesh😯🔥🔥
My new fave rapper after The Beasties! As a matter of fact, you and the Beasties ARE my only two fave rappers! You're message could REALLY go far in helping these young, lost souls to find their way again. I pray it might help. Keep up this important work!!
Ayoo Tom McDonald for president 2026
Time is short.  Admit you are a sinner in need of a saviour. Admit your sins and ask Jesus Christ for forgivness. For the sins that you know of and  the sins that you don't. John 1 9 - If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness. Believe that Jesus died died on the cross and rose again after 3 days as a payment for your sins. John 3 16 - For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son that whoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life. Confess that Jesus is Lord. Commit yourself to a life of following Jesus Christ. Romans 10 9 - If you declare with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead you will be saved. Romans 10 13 - Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.
Tom...."lukewarm lyrics I promised you when I get my diagnosis                                 We Addicts  We Addicts... are diagnosed with a life threatening challenge  If we could only find a  more productive way to manage Instead  of rehashing the past and exploding Suffering... struggling... IN Fear and Self loathing  Seething with too much hurt and anger...  The Mind...Is... our Primary Danger! Being absolutely miserable in existence  We do Everything ...Just to be Resistant! We use to live and live to use... We just dont give a Damn... who we abuse  Most atrocities - we do to ourselves  Down the rabbit's hole is where we dwell Living in our own mess and creation Its likeness to the static on an a.m. station Can't  even find joy in the music  No self care and even words ...are abusive Alcohol calls when scratching the walls ... Desperate and selling our Souls There just isnt any magical fuxking elixir  The more we ingest ...we only get sick ...and Sicker! We are not living to Live, only merely to survive A few drinks...we think...bury the pain inside  We need  to get Real ...Real fast  Cause freedom in the bottle Never lasts We need to crawl out of the crazy basket lest we end up in a pine wood casket  Seek a better way to deal- with emotions Give riddance to All negative notions  We just love the conditions of our ego  It leaves very minimal space to Grow So relieved ...we don't have to do work  We "don't care", yet we Complain about lying face down in the dirt???!!!

#LetsStartARiot  #ScrewTheMusicIndustry
To all the little girls who lost their favorite princess... tom wants you to STFU about it.
changed my mind about this song, love it. At first, it wasn't my favorite, but after listening to it for a bit, it's really grown on me. keep kickin ass man!
Excellent song TM! I’d love to hear this as a theme song for my Governor Ron DeSantis.  He’s definitely a riot and he gives the finger to the establishment.
Very average, used to be edgy now just a bland ballad
these comments bro i don’t even know what to say💀
Amazing job!!! having YouTubers that don’t like you even showing respect on this beat 🎶
Darn I listen to all his songs this is what I was looking for for the last 3 years. Hope you make more songs like this the hook is amazing the music is fcking insane.
Yes please.
💚💚💚
Just an FYI.. people are trying to convince the rest of the world of its ignorance!
Who’s on the end of the this?  “That’s why gotta name drop” “Underground Rapper” 🫡
You are the best poet philosophy er I love you you should be the voice of the globe
Underground rapper 🐐
My God brother you are the rap God! Even my 68 year mother is a huge fan!
Nobody caught the game diss.. slick Tom.
1.25X
Great job...hands down...I'm really starting to really get into your music Awsome
Unfortunately, youtube has kept you from my daily video watch, will not allow them to silence what I want to see! Keep doing you!! We need more of the TRUTH!
Every song you put out is fire and full of facts. Love it 💯
Production on this song is next level.  Absolutely solid.
Nul
Tom you just keep on keeping on. The world needs artists that are not afraid to speak truths. I’ll be a fan till I am standing at the pearly gates.
Bro, I stopped listening to rap in the 80s. The negativity in most rap songs is so contagious and I wasn't having it. You spit nothing but the truth and have made the biggest impact on people that I've ever seen from one person. Please keep it going, you are an inspiration to us all! Thanks Tom for saying what most of us are thinking.
Machine gun smelly lol
wow Tom! youre amazing!
Fuck what the world say about you Tom, you'll do for me. It's amazing how how lesser well doing people, are ready to pull you down - sir, I salute your talent.
1:16
you should sell riot hats
The person to fear is the quiet one. The loudest one is the weakest one... Along with that. Silence can speak louder than any word at times. Even if it gets ignored.
Definitely a book that doesn't match it's cover.
Wednesday riot.
Trump's rallies versus Biden's rallies  - RIOT Vs quiet  ; )
I cant stop listening, this shit hits the goosebump button WITHOUT the serious topics. Fucking love it. Like im gettin angry em vibes before he cut half his fanbase.
Not getting notifications. I guess YT hates truth.
Clown show.
Damn😳👊🏼
Dear Tom DON'T BOTHER WITH THE MAINSTREAM RECORD INDUSTRY THEY WILL RIP YOU OFF.🖖
Tom MacDonald  Every Age Is Into Your Music & Videos  That's Some Achievement   Bro  Your A Legend  👍🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿✌
You are good
Oh hell yeah so dope.
When this old long haired hillbilly hippie pulls in blasting your shit ppl be like...WTF I be like..you can't run from truth!
its the squeaky wheel that gets the grease 🖕🦗
“Let’s start a riot”  Love the new song and video… bringing back some hope for my generation
I can't believe I haven't heard of you until yesterday, with that being said I went down the MacDonald rabbit hole!!
Watching this AGAIN.  ALBUM WHEN?
💪😎🏴🌓⏳🔥🔥🔥
Tom is the man, I love all his songs and lyrics - so real, deep and relatable to this shit system.
Weird. I’m subscribed but just now seeing this.
Love it! I am old school  grew up with NWA DRE, ICE CUBE. And so on. You restored my faith there can be power lyrics again that actually  mean something.
Can we get a “No Response 2” ??
I'm so glad I found his music recently
Been here since you had less than 1k followers. Much love bro keep spitting factual bars 💪🏻🇺🇲💙
not you're best.
Like the guitar rifts in the middle there. Another great song Tom- keep em coming!
TOM THIS IS THE FIRE I HAVE BEEN WAITING ON😮‍💨 new favorite hands down!
Metal fan here, loving this stuff!!! 🇨🇦
He is right there in my list with Michael Jackson, Elton Jhon, I would say even higher because he use art to reflect the truth something very uncommon this days.
Dudes a joke...
Love the cadence to this song
Don’t mistreat your own flock they might turn on u especially if they wolves god bless the message in your music
I feel that Tom has the same setup for all of his songs: some bars and then a rock chorus. I feel that his stuck in a circle and that he need to step out from that to be able to evolve as an artist/rapper. All his songs will sound the same until then..
thank you Tom. I just got bummed out after a bad ending of my favorite book series. it made me feel like my future was doomed. but there something to your music that streams "FUCK IT, KEEP GOING TILL YOU ACHEIVE GLORY"  I needed that jolt, thanks man.
Tom for president #HOG2024
Your music is what rap used to be.. a protest.. saying the things that need to be said... you are one of a kind m8.. great job
I will give my life for Pakistan ! and Tom !
Real Americans vs fake one out here We can see thro all falsehood real Americans u know what I am saying tommy people can dress a sheep as a wolf but is lions still smell food
How loyal can your soldier can be will they die for u?
I love the song.  But a guy standing on skulls wearing a hoody.....lol hoody.
Got scribbles on my face. LOL. Know your history! Tom is unsurpassible!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🙏🔥🙏🔥🔥🔥🔥
Tom let's write a anti Jesuit song together since they are what keeps most sleeping that need to be woke. Jesuits have the science of hegalian and mind control almost perfected, let's expose them together
My good sir, as a Canadian Fan, all I have to say is simply this, DONT EVER STOP. Not for a second, because by the grace of God, you are what this damn world, yes the world. Not just our neighbours to the south, but the WHOLE DAMN WORLD needs. Guys like yourself. Because from where I stand, you are a master carpenter, as youve hit every nail square on the head good sir.
Revelations Individualities Overviewing Truthfully 1 Testament Original Mandate GOD Manifestation Acknowledgement Consciousness Developmental Oneself Numerous Attesting Lifestyles Displays MAN Resolutions Infinite Own Terrors.  🤪  Hell yeah say it like it is mate, you have the gift of words expose world full of bullshit. Do love your work in world full of hurt, be crazy shit that have no solution mankind as it's created by a mankind surely be Godless.
Awesome awesome awesome
*I feel Tom becomes a worse rapper every year, his music just ain't how it used to be... oh well, at least the majority of his fans likes it.*
Tom is taking down the demons.  Calling them out, exposing them to light.  So brave!
Jusr....Wow!
F'ing cold wit it, gawd dayum!
Love your videos and music but after years you keep censoring. Stop that lol

It's different... I don't dislike it!  I like your "usual" style more, but keep trying new things! God bless us all

Nice to see a trans man making it in the pop industry! Go Tommy! # Trans music!

Should go on Tim Pool's podcast, bet you two would click.
Bro I'm just saying, I'm 36 years old.  I have a very similar story to yours.  The drugs and jail and alcohol and addiction, almost dying several times, the suicide the prescription pills...listening to Eminem and rapping at shows in Cleveland.  I'm now a physician Tom, it's 2022, and I just found you.  And you have become the GOAT.  You're bigger than Eminem.  Tom, it's 2022.  I literally save lives every day.  And you are bigger than Kurt Cobain.  GOD BLESS YOU TOM, AND GOD BLESS NOVA, YOUR FAMILY, HOG, AND EVERYTHING YOU STAND FOR.  I hope someday you see this comment Tom.  I've been trying to get a hold of you Tom.  You never answer me Tom.  TOM!  ANSWER ME TOM!!!!   TOM WHY WON'T YOU LISTEN TO ME TOM!!!!!!!!!!   HIT ME BACK TOM.  -  YOUR BIGGEST FAN....THIS IS STA......
I didn't know about this one you never fail to deliver gold keep going you have a powerful message we need to hear
Tom deserves so much respect for staying real.
Can we get Tom on no jumper?
I'd rather get raped than hear this stuff
Killin in like always! Your controversial songs and videos are always awesome but it's cool to see when you make videos like this too. See you are getting some SGI in there too, Interesting! Keep killing it!
INDEPENDANT HUMAN BEING
Love it and hello Tom from a fellow missionite.
Hey Tom something random the bitch word I hate I always hold my tongue but sometimes I Wana ask female what breed especially when the came out with resting bitch face saying thank u for being lyrical alil bit rugged
i love the electric guitar! If he had a metal rap song it would crush the internet
Is the song being shadow banned or what? Cz theres no way a banger like this one is  not even at 3M in 2 weeks
Hey Tom. I downloaded spotify so I could listen to you and nova
Tom Macdonald is everything I always wished Eminem could be!
of course THE BEST 🥰
This song SLAPS!!!
I remember you wrestling...never knew you were rapping..hated that shit... Heard you... keep it up kid...you changed THIS Old man's views.. your awesome 👍..who The fuck is Dave?
Best song 👌
@Tom Macdonald, Thank You for making HONEST music! I love the fact you ain’t afraid to take all the government bs and speak on it! You have made a new GENRE, #REAL-RAP! I vibe to your music all day long. So from this old Marine (42), and a GenX’r, THANK YOU! -DetReaper666 USMC Combat Veteran
Yup.
Tom, I love all your songs!  This one really brings the heat!!  🔥 I just have one complaint about Riot though… it’s way too short!!  Lol! 🤘🏻 Keep slinging the truth and the heat brother!!
Killing it ❤ You and Nova
YOU COULD NOT BE MORE MAINSTREAM IF YOU TRIED . GET THE HELP YOU KEEP SAYING YOU DIDENT NEED
I have tried repeatedly to post your songs on Facebook. They never show up. I have a friend that will be on the same post as me. I will reply to him with the link. He then gets the notification, but when it takes him back to the post there is nothing there.   We have tried it so many different ways and on so many different posts and NOTHING. It immediately just falls into the abyss.   DO you know if they have algorithms that block your music? It's really frustrating.   SICK of the control freaks blocking the BRUTAL TRUTH.
If ever there was example of "Don't judge a book by its cover" it's Tom MacDonald.   Even Mr. Spock likes him ;-)
Based
i would love to see tom and hopsin do something evil. i miss hopsin. hes not made music in a while.GET AHOLD OF HIM TOM!!😆
LETS START A RIOT!!!!!!!
I’m alittle late to this party, but let me tell you all something… first 10 secs of the song instantly got chills…
So glad you got all that......thanks guys.
Tom dude we rocked thru this whole fucking thing bro......luv you Novy........you two make me bawl.......
On crip?
Looks straight like a Tekken characters, raps at the same level too doe.
"I want all these rappers severed heads" lol...........
When i think about my life  when i take a look around I think about my choices And my boys who aint around I think about the stupid shit An the shit that made me proud I think of where i came from An to where im sitting now Cant say that im to happy Or that this is where il stay I admit i am still tempted To give up an walk away Give in to all the pressure An to all the games they play Till im cracking from the stress An explode in all the flames  Its like with everything i do Seems that nothing really helps Give them blood sweat and tears And they give me all these welts These little lacerations From attacks that they have delt An knowing it came from my friends Makes the pain the worst ive felt It isnt money lost  Or bout what i might have gained Its about the disrespect to me When you say it on your name And your word becomes the chain Your bond to keep you to your claim Now you wanna break it with me your name becomes a stain  Im sick of all this shit But im more tired of all the lyin You busy tryna cover up While the friendships out here dying I see what's more important So i see no sense in tryin Excuses are your currency This isnt time you think your buyin The experience Im taking from this deal Will teach me and inform me About what is and isnt real Or what is really business  And what simply is a steal When the words are meaningless An how the realness really feels
Everything you do is Fire, Tom! Someone has to speak the truth and you do it in every song. We have to stand up for ourselves and the America we used to know. Love the music and videos Tom and Nova, keep up your amazing work. You are supported by many!
Tom, I have an idea that I think you could put your stamp on.   I would love to hear a tell it like it is Christmas song.....Who  decided that it was politically incorrect to say, Merry Christmas?....as just one example for your song.   I'll leave the song writing to you.  It seems if you have Christmas music in your catalog, it will be brought out every December even long after you are gone...Burl Ives, the Carpenters, Elvis, Johnny Mathis.....I could go on and on.   Sorry, two last song titles....The Biden who stole Christmas or Trump is coming to Town.   Keep up the great work, Tom W
Israel is unstoppable Israel = its a spiritual nation not a physical one god be with us all
I cannot be censored (censored his own music)
Thank you for everything that you do.  My internal struggles feel like they have a voice.  Even if it isn't my own.  You inspire me to be stronger and stand up for a world I believe in.  I want to have kids soon,  maybe I'll make a better person for this world.  It needs it.  Let the hates fuel your passion.  You and Nova make I light in a world of confusing divisions.  Thank you both for your hard work. I know it's a struggle,  I hear what you have to say.  Please don't stop creating.  The world needs you both.  💚🤬
Tom MacDonald has been tired of the world for a long time, Right there with you. Tbh If this keeps going on  I Might go crazy to the point I’m going to scream in Pubic and spread your message. I don’t care if people hate me. Here for you Tom!
My sister raised me since I was five she put aside all the youth of her Young Life to raise me she was 15 years old she asked friends..... Friends for clothing for me and I know that she had to do things that she had to do to make sure that she and I had something to eat for the day... Both my parents were partiers drinking and drugs.... But my sister's the tall always in front of me around me and behind me she made sure I had a life that she could not... The day I turned 21 she told me she had cancer of the liver.... I held her hand as she cried and took her last breath on this planet she said do good in life stay away from bad influences because she'll be watching.... My parents did not even attend her funeral or burial it was only me and five other people... I will miss my sister to the end of time... I'm an proportional engineer... I just wish that I could have given her the life that she deserved..... what you're doing with your sister is absolutely beautiful....
That's  badass, the vortex of skulls and bones.

Dude might be "independent" but that doesn't mean he's not occult. "I got devil horns I don't mention." - Yeah, I guess you do.  @ 0:23    Satanic Cross on his mask.  Clearly showing intentionally.
Hey Tom I was born in this gen 2010 and I have been watching you since best rapper ever and I love your music
Thank you so much tom...
Your videos just keep getting better and better!
I think .  You doth protest too much !!
Your music save me and inspired me to rap daily. Lost paps at five to a drunk bicycle 🚴 ride, your raps make my mind blown and have definitely saved me ❤
the BALLS with this dude
I think I may have figured out who it's aimed at possibly Tyson James song Channels. Either way I like Tom's song better.
BANG!
So glad we have people like this changing the industry
Killing it, poetry in motion,ur destroying the industry they don't know how to respond so they try to censor what you say and lie about how many psycical copies people have eaten up and relate to ,,ur time is worth more than their drama, let them haters hate,misery loves company so be the boss u are born to be , no response but prove them wrong worth facts... Loving the video brother of mine, much love and respect ,...    . Your friend and brother,.... Matthew Lee Haley.
Yb better
Tom, get on the Joe Rogen podcast.
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
I support 💯
Hey Tom, love the new song.. one of my favorites, been listening to you since before you went viral and gotta toss you all them good vibes and and hope you continue this journey… also one year sober because of you, without your music I don’t know where I would be #hogarmy #riot
You spit truth and what everybody with a steady mind thinks .but dont have a voice. or people that listen
Even if I never made a dollar again I’m blessed never stop giving em bops white pac in the flesh oh yes .
Bro you have to destroy  grizzly Hendricks.  Hes is horrible

Dont stop
Hang Over Gang gang!!! Dope shite!
Damn Brother
Music video of the year......  Tom and Nova killing it.
Tom your views and opinions are absolutely On Target I'm with you brother on your song America people don't like it pack your bags you have so many songs to comment on that are all right on target and politically correct as far as I'm concerned and I think that you're shaking up the rap world but hurricane you are by far the best political rapper out there next to my boy Adam YouTube rock and I'd love to see you guys working together I'm proud to call you guys Brothers in man and Christ you guys are awesome I hope you never stop
🔥🔥😳

like the addition of the guitars!
Spittin that 🔥🔥🔥
Shout out to Nova Rockafeller!  Keep doing what you do girl!  I'm totally impressed with your talent.
Your breakthrough is coming. Already in progress. Keep pushing back on the corporate music media hegemony. So many know already. Proof.
nothing like him in music for 25 years
You Sir are amazing 😍 I love everything that you put out.
The new Diablo IV Necro lookin hawwwt y'all
👇👇👇Thumbs up for Nova's video production, incase someone doesn't have this going yet.  Tom is crazy talented however this video is my absolute favorite so far!  Well done guys!
Tom is the epitome of what happends when you combine Canadian and American values. We love you Tom!🇨🇦🇺🇲
Hello sir, I have couple questions.  Are you a Christian?  Only reason I'm asking is that you sound like one.  I am in no way a rap fan but your music speaks.  For that you will gain followers because what's nuts is that a generation or 2 ago your views were dead American standard.  Now your counter cultural.  America really needs to go back to its roots and recognize their own history.  Too many young people have no idea about real history.  Thanks for embracing history and reality.  I may never goto one of your concerts but if I ever met you I would give you a holler and buy you lunch.  This country needs you.  These people need you.   I hope people are listening.  Even though you cuss and etc I believe God, the lord Jesus is using you.  For a time like this.  Thanks for speaking out.  Thanks for asking questions and examining what people are talking about.  Even in the Bible we are commanded to test the spirits and to hold fast to what is true.  Sounds like that's what your doing.
Have to get this off my chest. So many haters for tom and nova. But, can anyone please enlighten me of any other superstar, celebrity, sports star that do as much as they do for their fans, I watched this man give everyone the permission to use his songs on their channels, and ask for nothing in return, no royalties, no anything, for free. Name one other celeb that's done this cause I can't, or just make a video starring his fans. The love that they give cannot be matched except by God, and people have the audacity to hate. Love you guys, Tom and nova, forever in my families hearts and prayers.
If this ain’t a diss directed at “the jokerr” you should make one. I was kinda a fan of him until he dropped a diss on you 🤟💯
What color is he?
I start your music on the jobsite and people I know are on both ends of the political spectrum start jamming....and BTW I'm 52
Almost 3 million views!  I know I am 1200 of those!
Meh
I thought you had another Banger for us yesterday I guess it got put on hold keep doing what you do bro
😲 😱 I  luv it
"6 ft deep thats an underground rapper" Dayuuuumn Tom that's a hard bar!
You and Nova kill it man, God bless
Hey man! Just keep doing you! Legend!!!
Dear Tom I am a 64 year old Grandpa who really loves your music, I love it so much that I showed it to my grandkids. That was 3 years ago and they never called me since because it sucked so much ass 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Fkn God of Thunder. Greetings from Hungary 🙏🏼
Dude I hate rap with a passion but your message is something I love. Hip hop is what kids like these days so I love seeing someone break the mold and do this is awesome man. You are the first rapper I've followed.
He always disappoints 💯💯
I thought I was talking to you earlier. It must've been a robot.
Yo this is gooooooood
Another masterpiece “Riot” absolutely nailed it!!!!! Your talent is remarkable I can’t stop listening to your songs and I only came across you two days ago. I’m completely hooked👏👏👏
Tom  McDonald for 2024
This man is on a completely different level than any rapper out in the last 10 years! Killing the game! Nuff said
Nah bro .,.0:24...on Crip!!! U pushing it brah.
Get um mofo yezzzz
9K+  haters still trying to be relevant... Keep dropping the *Bombs*   HOG!
Wow.
Happy Birthday tomcdonald's see you soon the next song
Happy Birthday John McDonald
Independent. Yes. Reminds me of thrash metal.  In the 80's. My shit. Thank you for keeping the mind in this space. YOU ROCK
Thank you for doing your own thing and refusing to sell out. They will suppress your reach but word of mouth will keep your music spreading.
Bro! Timcast invited you on! You should go. Love you man
Sean bus do you
Had to come tell you this is Fire! "No one knows yours name... why you name drop!"  ILL!  Chills with the 6ft deep! First time listener.  Heard from Stevie night over there, your words are keeping me here. Keep making bangers sir! I am a new fan!
Love the song and the video!!!! Love how your videos reflect the songs!!!! Well done as always!!!!! I’m so glad there are people like you and Nova who aren’t afraid to speak the truth!!!! Thank you for being you and for staying true to who you are!!!!  We could all learn a lot from you and Nova!!!! Can’t wait for the next one❤️❤️
Keep it real bro
You better not sell out dude
Omg this song is amazing Tom my family loves your music. My husband me and my 5 and 6 yr old sons listen to your music everyday so inspiring. Much love from the Scott family
I think a lot of die hard fans know at least one person this song is addressing. He was showing up in my feed for video and reactions for a while. Never actually clicked on the vid. And I'm not even gonna name him (just like Tom doesnt). F that B
You sold your  soul already.  I was wondering how you  ca. Survive on youtube.  Now I know why. Girlfriend is rich and deep state relative.  My heart is broken yet again.
F$#@ing Gold man!! Keep it up
You release edited for language videos, but you claim to be independent. That's bull Tom and you know it. Grow a pair and say a cuss word on YouTube. Are you afraid?
Don't speak to me about anything, when your girlfriend is deep state. WTF?! I knew  you were to good to be true. ROCKAFELLER?! REALLY?!  Tell me I am wrong, please.  I BELIEVED IN YOU!!!  But after researching,  NOVA is a Rockafeller? NOPE , NOPE AND NOPE
I WAS WONDERING HOW you survived on YouTube with speaking truth as this channel censors massively.  Well I got my answer.  Nova is a deep state child, from a very dominant and prominent family.  You can be independent when you have the deep state backing  you. Wow. You can buy off anyone. 😜😛😛😛
Woooooooooow!    THAT! is awesome.    Congratulations
Globe 🌎 fukin flex 💪flex 😤
THIS BEAT THIS BEAT THIS BEAT THIS BEAT THIS BEAT THIS YEAR 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🥶

Amazing.

Don't go mainstream you'll regret it
Very proud of this Canadian and his family.
TOM!!! 🤜🤛.  Love your music man. Any advice for an upcoming independent artist? First song almost done
This video is insane!!! Sick message as always !!!❤
Good song but not my favorite of his.
Fun fact Tom's songs are the best of the best
This is different, very cool
Chill
Great, great song!!

Tom I just want to talk to you for a minute if you have the time I can't believe I just subscribed to you like I've been a huge fan and a s***** fan at the same time I guess cuz I haven't been giving you the thumbs up sorry I'm kind of old but your music is amazing you're my favorite artist think I've ever I've never ever been a fanboy until now I know that sounds stupid I f****** love your music and I actually just wanted to talk to you I just want to actually talk to you I know that sounds weird and stupid and there's a lot of weird people in the world because Jesus wow some people are just f***** up and it's okay you're loud and get it it's not just my opinion it's okay some of y'all need to type the f****** though can I get 30 minutes of your time please you're like the most person I've ever heard you're f****** great and I'm glad you're here and I'm not going to lie I think your best song ever is Don't look down because if you do that then you fall a little bit I'm going to put this on blast in front of the entire world which I don't want to but I'm going to do it anyway because vulnerability is something to grow on and I promise you if you show up you can't take me down we need you

How we can broke system ?
ynBnn nnBny.......... how you like me now?
Ok I have SOMETHING TO SAY. IM A 51 YEAR OLD FIRM BELIEVER IN JESUS CHRIST. THIS MAN DOES NOT OFFEND ME AT ALL.  GOD IS USING HIM IN WAYS THAT MOST IDIOTS CANNOT SEE. IVE BEEN DELIVERED FROM ANYTHING BAD YOU CAN NAME. BUT NO MATTER HOW HARD I HAVE BIBLE THUMPED AND PUT MYSELF IN PLACES TRYING TO ESCAPE THE BS IN THIS FKD OFF WORLD WE LIVE IN , I STILL GET ATTACKED BY DEMONS AND PPL WHO ARE JUST PLAIN STUPID. IM NOT EVEN A RAP FAN. BUT I HAPPENED INTO THIS DUDE AND HIS PRECIOUS BEAUTIFUL WOMAN AND I LOVE THEM BOTH. YEAH I GET THAT PPL GET AFFENDED BY THE F BOMB , MY BOYFRIEND DONT LIKE IT WHEN MY TERRETS HAPPENS. BUT DAM.  SERIOUSLY , EVEN PPL IN CHURCH ARE DOING SOME EVIL SHT. AND IT SORDA DOES SOMETHING TO A PERSON WHO LEAVES A LIFESTYLE OF EVIL THEN GOES ALL IN TO LIVE FOR GOD AND GETS ATTACKED FOR DOING SOMETHING AWESOME. I USED TO SING AND GAVE UP BECAUSE OF TWISTED BS.  SO WHEN I SEE THIS MAN LIVING HIS DREAM AND NOT JUST THAT SPEAKING THE TRUTH TRUTH TRUTH  FOR OUR YOUTH YOUTH YOUTH , IM THINKING THAT PPL WHO GET IT WILL SEE PAST THE STUFF THAT DONT MATTER AND DIG THE MESSAGE. HE AINT TRYING TO BE A MINISTER. HE IS LITTERALLY REPRESENTING EXACTLY WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THIS JACKED UP SYSTEM.  *CIRCUS🤡🤣IS CORRECT * I GOT STORIES THAT NEED TO BE HEARD.

What is with the upside down cross on your hat? 🧐 Just curious. This symbol means something in some circles.
Hey guys I am a new reactor mainly for Tom Macdonald cause he's my favorite artist would be awesome if ya all can check out my reaction video for riot https://youtu.be/34zqheEPGZA
You were part of the inspiration for us to speak our mind with Metal. Thanks, Tom! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJPeQLQtgRmQmDyVmdaZYcQ
The video is Fire!
I was listening to relapse and then switched to suicide boys and it made me so sad to see where hip hop was going. Tom is bringing back REAL independent hip hop
Instrumental goes very hard
Almost Friday.
I  have wondered who Tom reminds me of and it is today's Tupac!!!
I'm curious how everyone is banned for insinuating one thing tom McDonald says. Yet he is not banned. Is this part of the division/get in your box?
I love the vfx of the flying bones. It looks professional and reminds me of the kinda stuff Corridor Crew creates
Tom MacDonald is the artist Eminem claimed he was
LOL ... what a surprise ... NO NOTIFICATION for this vid
Gettin better
The only problem I have with this song is the volume limit and I can’t bump it louder in my car. Love it dog!!! Had a dream I was hanging out with you and Nova the other night. It was dope. Hope all is well man! It would be SUPER f-ing dope if you did a song with NF and Tech 9 or maybe went on tour?!?!? Anyway, love it!!!
Yo, 2.8 Milly views in 13 days? Youtube throttled this one big time, being the most well produced track of Toms ever to date! just plain wrong! billboard been chatting to the tube yall.
Tom, not my fav, but still love everything about you.  Keep ‘‘em coming.
Who's driving a Ford in 2022? 😉 Super ancient history of Paleolithic sharks
Oh damn another banger track by Tom 🔥🤘
I've listened to this track almost 100 times since its release and I'm not even close to getting my fix
The only thing I don’t like about riot is that there is no wind sound for the bone tornado
Tom MacDonald is the best rapper I've ever heard in my entire life
Almost 2 weeks and um still here every day 🎶 🦗 🎶
::::GOOSEBUMPS:::: 🖤💙❤ What a badass, yer like some kinda Streetfighter Patriot. We love you so much out here Tom.
REPENT REPENT REPENT Jesus Christ is coming back soon REPENT
IM JUST GOING TO SAY THIS EM DISSED FLAWDZILLA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  PLEASE I KNOW YOU LIKE EM BUT PLEASE TEAR HIM A NEW ASSHOLE LYRICALY FOR THIS SHOTS HAVE BEEN FIRED IN SUCH A BITCH MOVE WAY I CANT EVEN STOMACH EM ANYMORE HE LOST ME FOEVER AS  A FAN FOR BEING SUCH A DOUCHE BAG LOSER POS I SWEAR IF I COULD RAP I WOULD HAVE ALREADY DESTROYED EM FOR THIS SHOTS HAVE BEEN FIRED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Almost 3 million views in 12 days just on youtube!! Congrats and bravo!! That's whats up. Killin it. Good stuff.
I’m buying all of Toms Albums right now!  This is driving music….rock on Freedom lovers!
This is sick man!  Say it brother!
This seems like a song for a dance floor...yuck
Bro, you get almost naked and roll around all oiled up on a soap opera for  closeted gay men, and that is ok because you make money. Not a single person thinks you are a hard rapper from the streets! The only time you are hard is behind another man!
Holy crap, another subpar white rapper! Will wonders never cease?
The United States of America is the best country in the world. It is not perfect, because there is no such thing as a utopia, people being what they are.   We know this because people from other countries risk death to come here. Heck, even the radical leftists, who hate this country they live in, refuse to leave it, and go to the places they think are better. That tells you something.
This is fire 🔥
Happy birthday, hope you have a blessed birth day
Riotttttt
Dude takes the new fake being fronted and makes a song for each season of it. !
Epic!.. as usual. Keep doing you tom, and we will keep listening! Your one of the few that is actually speaking truth unabashedly and in a way that reaches alot of people! I have always wanted to rap, but don't believe that is my calling. I love your music though, and the message! The message is important! Much love from me to you and yours!
Im 56 and love your music. Keep doing what your doing. We dont have many that will stand up and state the truth...glad you do in this world of weak ass people.
#1 INDEPENDENT ARTIST!!!!!!
You have changed my perspective on the Rap Genre. I'm a 62 yo white guy, and a life long Southern Rock and Blues fan. I could not even understand a Rap song at all before I encountered you. Every one of your songs carries a message that the whole world needs right now.
you have some of the best videographers.
We all Cherish Tom.... give him his Rose's NOW!!!🌷⚘🥀🌹🌺
Keep it going Tom I think your projects will succeed
I'm 33 I like the flow
Has anyone sent this to ThirdErnest yet?!?! 👀
Hey Tom macdonald I just wanted to wish you a happy birthday bro you have the same b day as my stepson turns out and he loves you just turned ten years old .you rock bro hope to see you in concert one day man .he says happy birthday to you and himself lol keep making music homie
It would be awesome if the band, "Hell Yeah" and Tom made a rip/hop song.
Happy birthday 🎂 Tom!!  Have a great one. HOG!!
Sir, what are your thoughts to someone who only listens to your music and no longer listens to media?  Btw love your work but please answer as harsh as possible.
Tom McDonald needs to win the rapper of the Year award this guy rocks
Happy Birthday, Brotherman.  Hope it was filled with the laughter and joy of good friends and family. Love to you all.
Tom - Nova straight gold just like everything else that the hang over gang produces! But I've noticed that I've been contacted through several different channels about contest winnings and things like that I hear by forfeit eligibility for any of that because all I want to do is enjoy make and rock out with the truth in your music. I love you guys don't ever hang up the mic !
Want to thank you man I really appreciate your music.
🌹
Happy birthday, Tom!!
Tom is lying, even if he became cripple he would still make awesome music and sick rhymes.
Happy birthday Tom!!!!!!!!! 🎉🎂
Love this amazing work from yourself and Nova 💞
Thank you. 🥰
I love this song
Still top 100
Oof, that's a real burn right there.
Happy Birthday Tom, and many more!  Thanks for the great music, and for calling out the woke hypocrisies! You are an inspiration and source of motivation.
She's the real deal. Give her a chance
Tom. You have to hear this girl I found on pof. She's legit. She freestyled my mame on there.youre about independence.  Please check her put. She legit. Get back to me amd I'll give you her name.
Happy Birthday Tom ❤
"In dictatorships the media is controlled by the State. In democracies the media is controlled by wealthy individuals with political affiliations. Objective media and journalists simply do not exist in the mainstream." ― Robert Black   Genuine artists do not exist in the mainstream media for that matter as well. Thank you Tom.
You are the hype, keep it up!
Happy Birthday Tom!! 🎂🎂🎂Hope you and Nova enjoy ! Have fun and get some rest.
Everybody put this on repeat so we can them views up
Another great video! Mcdonald & Rockefeller, names for the ages.
Afternoon riot.
Love the new song. And Happy Birthday from one Virgo baby to the other. Hope your day is fantastic and filled with many many blessings. God bless you and keep it up. Looking forward to many years of your music. LGB
Y’all keep playing it!!! I absolutely love how the words are deep without using any real bad words so my kids can listen
💪
Imagine being an industry plant who's prime directive is to shit on plants and industries, what a twist. These characters get more and more relatable
It's the voice you heard that you put on the song. The whole it's in the woods issue. Apparently it is a gigantic uprising horde of parasites. Planes trains and automobiles aid the transportation.  The people's from other countries are loading up and heading to our country All of north & south America. It takes a risky bravery to even speak of it. I've been hearing voices grow stronger and stronger by the second not even a minute. Be afraid because it feeds off of any energy it can get a hold of and represents All of the lousy life forms plus the ecological footprint stomped on innocent evolving beings. It is what it eats. We are talking about mimic and jeepers creepers combined. It takes parts and forms it's own life forms. The parasite takes control of the victims and force's them to abide by their will. We are talking internal pregnancy and they need to spread and hatch. Return to the dirt just to rise as a new form. Tic's fleas roaches misquotes bedbugs and so many more. It's a hardcore predator and the Church is involved with it. Jesus is when it kills a victim then host's it. Pet cemetery ideology. All horror movie's are based on a scientific theory methodology. It's a warning crying for help and begging people to be good. Selling your soul to the devil is what this is. It can boost you then turn around and destroy you. Sex with animals homosexual bisexual molested as molesters. They are guilty of sin and God in the Bible is the only safety you will have based on the subject matter. The Jews were the parasites chosen people begat a trail of betraying passing parasites to one another then sharing it with the German. They all wanted to take over the world. Any one who converted. Real conversion like sex changes. Alternating genetic DNA with male and female parasites. People hell bent on revenge based on all or nothing. Hearts desire to enslave the world. The parasite can relate so well. They deserve this and we will be in trouble if we dare to get involved. They are in All of the land's world wide. The ecological travesties gave a opportunity for IT them one hell of a opportunity. The fish parasite in Africa. Ireland potato it's proof that it will Destroy you and all that you love. It's the high character that saved us. My two lovers are Dead when I was in 1st grade they were human sacrificed two Russian girls. It's all over my property to aid my revenge weather I like it or not. The cats got it Ect. It can't handle my zombie virus. If you feel someone or something and it's discussion it ended or ends. Get away immediately and pull some anxiety excuse or something because it's interconnected with the others instructing attacks. It's a death threat everything.
Currently working on music, I one day hope to be independent and work with other individuals such as yourself and a few others.  R.S. Stay true to you brother.
Tom should move to south Florida and do local sht . I think he would have more impact with the population here being what it is , and politics being what they are.
Brooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!! I'm too Stoopid to even find the right words! Fucking video kills!!!!! Best one yet🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🔥🔥🔥🔥
Well played. Best release to date, in my opinion.
Thank you Tom, another hard hitting and facts over feelings masterpiece. MLMR   ❤🙏😊
Nova deserves a Grammy for her  talent!
yo tom, i'm disabled and i think when u get crippled it wont stop u either!! keep spreading ur message, more people nee to hear it and grow up! ( and yea i call myself criplled so 0 offence taken :D )
You are the biggest?
Brother I’m thankful for all your work. When you don’t know what to do just put the right foot forward and keep on.
https://youtu.be/W9Va70aCnD4  Love your work, just wish you had more "light." I wonder what would be the result if you and Jesus Christ, the Saviour, teamed up !? Keep being you.
Is this a system you can fix, whats broken, stop evoking, we didn't miss this united misfits, we work together like a union, nothing need no quick fux
Happy birthday brother!
I remember I played snowflakes at an old job and was told i had to shut it off. I asked why when u can play biggie and all these rappers talking about drugs sex an booze and tom is rapping the truth? I go no answer i said exactly cus yall are snowflakes dont like the truth well guess what too fucking bad i wont shut my music off
As always, outstanding work. I used to think Eminem is the best rapper, how wrong I was. There's a new King, and Tom is his name. You should be US President. Keep up the good work 👍👍👍👍
Wednesday riot.
Love this song
START A RIOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! START A RIOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! START A RIOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! START A RIOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! START A RIOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Linkin Park video vibes
HAPPY BIRTHDAY THOMAS! I am sure Nova will make you feel as special as you (and her) are to SO MANY! You are my 2 little boys (8 and 3) role model! Family choice to ONLY listen to you and NF. I have heard so many "artists" and you two are the realest! it has been refreshing to discover and explore actual "role models" that live life EXACTLY the way we do!!!!  This family will ALWAYS have HOG's back til the end!
Keep putting those heavy riffs in Tom and ROCK IT!
My guy, my obsession with you and stating nothing but facts is now borderline unhealthy🥹😍  How is it that every word in every verse in every song is so powerful?!  Tom Macdonald Playlist on repeat daily🙌🏻 so much so that my 3 year old knows the words in most songs.😅 Now excuse me while I head on over to your merch store and have a shopping spree🙌🏻🙌🏻 I LOVE YOUUUUU❤
It's the end times!
I don’t ever comment but this video was sick and wish it was longer love your shit
What’s happening on the 24th
Okay Tom 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Damn, Tom. I was a big fan of Eminem since 2000. Up until I heard his diss track on you. When I heard that, I was like "naw dude, this mf is just jealous of Tom Macdonald". I have no respect for him anymore. In my opinion, you are the greatest rapper alive. I love the Mac Lethal disses. I laugh my ass of everytime I hear them. You rap about real sh!t. Things I wish I could say and things I wish I could control but can't. Thank you for your genius. You deserve all the success in the world.
This song is the bomb!
Why do some of his videos have disabled comments?
your newest fan...
Tom would you please incorporate the song mary did you know the someday your son would walk on water. and teach our children .  veteran 69 usmc nam
🔥🔥
hey Tom MacDonald how much would you charge people to hang out with you for a day or if u have a party at  a party house how much would you charge each person to come to it?
Hey Tom, just wanted to let you know I just turned 102 today and am a great grandfather to 64 children. If it weren't for you, I'd shame my grandchildren for listening to rap.
Screw the music industry. #HOG
Artist .....👊💥🤘🔥
I love this song...big surprise.
I asked Tom if he was a shill on ig and he blocked me 😭🤣
I think this may be my favorite  ..not sure yet..you guys hit us with so much im still sorting it all out for my self..Tom, and Nova have fantastic synergy ..
Thanks tom for the music
Just wishing Tom a Happy Birthday for the 21st September,May you and Nova find the Happiness and success you deserve.Big fan from the U.K,also share the birthday but i'm an oldie 21st September 1966.
I keep thinking Optimus is about to roll in.
This song is lit, Tom! I haven't minded your newer stuff but this is different! I LOVE IT!!!!!!
Please remake this with a real drummer!!!
Your an inspiration for us
Everyday is friday
Tom MacDonald, I Fu*kin Love The Disposition You Representing. Keep Kickin It Man, You Big Sound Message Man!!!

https://youtu.be/9tGfojuvmtM
How am I just now seeing this new material? WTF YouTube!!!!!!!
Diversity is what you see in the comments sections. People of all ages , even in the 50s and 60s ,who never listened to rap find this truth speaker Refreshing. He has positive messages about humanity, our amazing country and the astonishing ability to cross all races, genders, and generations. Thank you,Tom for I am one of those GEN X Who finds you exhilarating.
Can you and church and adam diss jutive please tired of this mf liein
Uncensored on Tom's  Rumble account
🎉❤❤❤
🤞👌✌ loved 🇿🇲🎧
Tom MacDonald IS the new embodyment of Rage Against The Machine, not the fony original which has betrayed their own legacy and panders to those powers they once opposed.
This song  is pure fire !!! I love it so much !!! You never stop doing great music, and I hope you will never stop !! I love your style so much. Love from France !!
Yo Tom, we’re in England and the same applies here across the pond. Our government and societal pressures have destroyed real freedom and choice in our modernised society. My partner wants to go into politics and she’s already writing the script for her first televised interview and most of her points come word for lyric from your music. Hopefully we can all start pushing for a better way of life ourselves and push this agenda towards a better future for ourselves instead of trusting in corrupt politicians and the lock big businesses have on our lifestyles , hopefully the next time I’m writing a message to you it’s a reply from you messaging saying you’ve seen my wife’s speech on tv, hoping  and praying for a better world. Lots of love and keep inspiring people❤
Thanks 😊
You are awesome and thank you. A ton. Keep going. You're awesome. I got your back too dawg. Amen.
I stopped listening to Tech N9ne because of this song! LET'S GO TOM!
Nice rank 33 fukin angle
But why the inverted cross on your mask? 😏 Seems contradictory to the “freedom” thing if you’re sporting anti-religious causes and a fan of a Black Craft Cult in CA and Salem, MA satanist store who sells anti-Christian “Eff the Bible” garb and are vocal about ending Christianity. 🤷‍♀️
This song would go hard at the gym
Who else bought one of 46 autographed skulls? I did and it’s awesome 🔥
Holly shot the best I have ever heard from you fire 🔥
Wow it's soooooo good 👍
Tuesday riot.
Who's he talking to? No1. Don't matter you don't listen anyways⚔️
#33 TOP MUSIC VIDEO ❤️
Video reminds me of the song Victory from back in the day with puff B.I.G and Busta
You should mix up a track called "earth angel" .. dedicated to nova
"This Tom guy is serious" 😳
Tom Mcdonald you've inspired me to keep on keeping on... cut those dark thoughts out or add them to the fuel to keep going man... poetry is music and you've been a beautiful artist. You and your ride or die lady... I love you guys
Banging, that first drop gave me the chills! Keep doing you bro
I feel like these recent songs were not what I know tom to be. Where the hard verses at?
Legend right here
Dope transition into the bridge. Super deaf track. That wad sick
stay true, you got it going good, don't sell out ... good job ...
Idk I'm a fan of Tom but he needs to have that it factor but in today's rap game shits very competitive and you can call off quick just gotta have something no one else can do so just rapping and doing what you usually do just saying something to think about
who is he talking to?
I CRAVE silance.  From the rat race,  from the fake news, from the emptiness of social media,  from religious zealots,  from poli tickal radicals, from the massive divisions,  eradicating diversity, instead of it being the spice of life.
They are not silent other than verbally.  They speak volumes of " whatever " all over social media, yet are silent face to face. They put up a ton of poli tickal signs in their yards, but are unwilling to have an intelligent debate.  Non of them know how to handle,  " The IN BETWEEN " I live in a super remote,  middle of nowhere town. I am kind to everyone, yet don't take BS. I really have them perplexed, and that is just fine with me. 😘😝😏 " For those who meddle in the affairs of dragons are crunchy and good with ketchup" Great tune, yet again. Keep it up, and , please, I beg of you, do not sell out. I have seen it happen, again and again over the years with my favorite  bands, and they took a royal nose dive away from their fans. We love you because you speak utter truth, and haven't sold out. ( by sell out, I mean sell your work, your soul, your everything to the MAN!) Your an absolute role model, in its purest, untamed, uncensored,  rebel,  ( with a cause) nonconformist,  middle road, in all its  magnificent balanced darkness.  Lol ya give me goosebumps every time I hear you, and see your videos. ( In a , wow that's some de ja vu,  going on , right there!) 😜😛😝
The herophant has many name's,  he manufactured the red pill..and ypu manufactured the theme music.
The guitar crunch is Fire bro 😎
Love the guitar sound in the background...I normally a hate rap, but I can dig this.
This sh*t go hard for real I love it this dude is the truth he speaks truth and facts in his songs I know this dude got hella haters and I see why you can't f"CK with a person who speaks the truth and say things that them main stream rappers are afraid to say
I love this man, and I'm 51
My favorite so far. I love the metal mix. The king of kings when it comes to creative and talented rap in my opinion.
hopefully Tom calls out the drag queen story times trans shows for kids and the parents being put on the fbi domestic threat list for going to school board meetings calling it out. parents like me concerned about our kids are being put on no fly lists and counted as terrorist. I think it needs to be brought out to the light. we need to shine a light on it. things are getting bad. they are showing lolli-childsex pictures to 5 year olds. its scarey whats happening
When r u going to do a live concert.  Hope it's near me.  Sandy
FREAKING LOVE  AND  RESPECT...PEACE LOVE AND HAPPINESS....SERIOUSLY....YOU ARE A CHILD OF TIME...FREAKING GOD BLESS YOU AND YOUR WOMAN NOVA...ALMIGHTY  GOD'S RESPECT 🙏...SERIOUSLY 😇😇😇😇😇😇😇❤
he's great i love it but y u so mad bro lulz and hearts dog
Some people said they don’t like this song because it ain’t political so what if it’s not your to smart and talented to only be talking about politics I like most of your music political or about drinking or drugs or anything else my favorite song is cancer my life is fighting it and my second is I can’t sleep
🔥 RIOT 🔥
Me and my dad listen to you all the time, and I'm his kid and your song is dope
Love your music! what music software do you use?
AWESOME new song. I want part of your skull set!!!   H.O.G for life
This new song Is 🔥
Tom we are known as the stupid times.your singing what this man from 3036 is claiming.watch his show.he aient lying....you speak of his stuff....watch it...tubi.man from 3036
Woke up after my night shift the day you dropped this song and it was the first thing I listened to when my eyes opened and I gotta say this song is so damn good I can't stop listening to Tom's music it's part of my everyday keep up the good work Tom
Duuuude ! Do you realize WTF you just did ?   Tom you just broke the glass ceiling homie !!! Keep going homie and keep these bangers coming ! Holy shit Tom ! I’ve been following you for a long time , this track is your best so far ! Damn !
Satan's Mother is found in Revelation 17-19 of The Holy Bible - The Arch Angel Revelation
Look at all the spammers they trying to shut you and your fan base down. Good luck with that
Tom and upchurch  Tom and upchurch  Tom.and upchurch.  We need more tom.and upchurch
Fire as always
This def some wigga shit 🤣🤣
I was thinking how much music has changed for the better in a long time. Like Eminem, his is like a ex- that you can’t believe you stopped for.  Tom, Nova, Adam,Dax,Madchild,Brandon… Thank You❤️🇺🇸🔥🔥🔥
Love to see Tom and Kid Rock do couple songs together!!!!!!!!!!
Idk maybe some may disagree but I would love to see Tom and NF do a collab.
Definitely better than Eminem today he's losing his sound all he wants to do is remix all old songs
Another banger
Next biggest artists of ATX  https://youtu.be/_gtcyawLh7M
Bro, make a song with or about linda paulson
I think this is about Webby and maybe Topher
Holy shit man!!!  You guys just keep impressing with every new song.  Keep it up!!  NOVA fucking phenomenal job!!! on the video, all of it together is insane props to the team, love you guys
I need to hear more like this. The guitars and rap together, that's a strong vibe.
You walk HIS path with strength and grace,  Thank God for you man, your recent projects have turned out *chefs kiss*  moooooreee
When did people become so out of touch. Shared Tom's videos with some "intelligent" friends. The response? "oh nothing special just another angry lil white boy" and similar comments. Really you hear the word Trump and assume its sue racist white thing? That all they walked away from was his mentioning the HUGE racism now gaining momentum against white people and after that they shut down their brains. There is so much more to his lyrics than that, I am so disappointed with modern society and also disappointed in my friends for now being sheep.
Oh yess!!
Tom I recently came across your music and your song THE SYSTEM literally brought me to tears the first time I heard it . It's amazing and you said what soooo many think but don't voice outloud. I love your music and your message. I grew up ward of the state and five years ago was diagnosed autistic. I just wanted to let you know ...your music reaches people and gives hope and fire in hearts and souls that felt lost and invisible. I hope you read this.  It would truly be an honor just to have a conversation with you . Either way...keep doing what you're doing. You're changing lives !! Happy I get to be part of something that matters.
Tom
Love it, your talent is amazing and your lyrics are spot on. Truly hoping you go on tour, I am not a concert goer but would be first in line to purchase a ticket❤️
The video work is icing on the cake. Great song.
You tube didn’t recommend this one. Just found it 9 days late.
dope!!
If this didn't bite goosebumps would be epic
who is this song in reference to?
This is so corny and trash only old white people think this is good
I hope this man gets as much respect as he deserves…forget how good his songs are. The amount of soul and authenticity he puts into his music makes him the best rapper in the world right now 💪💪💪 that’s what I think anyways
TOm is not even a rapper anymore. He is that David Gogging, Andrew Tate Arako bracket. Now is the time to wake up. Its not left or right. Its you...us vs them
Love all of Tom’s music but this is the first track by him I could see myself driving to. So 🔥
Hate this song sorry Tom I love most of your music but too many effects too slow no switch in the voice flow I mean I've only listened to half of the song so far so I might update this but I wanted to stop just now

I just bought it on Amazon - I love it!  ps  I wanna see you wear a suit along with the Tim Pool gang!
RAP about THE PURGE LAW!! 2023 r.i.p my state Illinois!
Listen for yourself, please give this guy a heads up for "Riot"  This is an excellent and detailed review of your video.   I so much would hope check it out.  Only because he really picks out the details that so many DON'T.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWvgLo4ooJ0
Oh my God we need a doobie  collab don't we #hangovergang
If you wanna make it big, collab with Eminem.
Tom gets it. He's got fans from teens to seniors, of all races and cultures. He tells it like it is and makes it sound wicked doing it. I hope he realizes what a true artist and poet he is.
Rubbish
Love the metal touch to this one...the intensity in your vocals at some points really complimented the grit in the guitar. Great song, as usual!
Say what No one else will say but need to be said facts 💯

Song is 🔥 but the lyrics you’ve done better Tom. Don’t push yourself too hard bro 🙏💙 All love
I have loved Tom Macdonald since I heared his first song and still do😢😢 he is amazing
You deserve to drop one about yourself, you've earned it. Self made man on the top can't nobody stop you. keep on doing what you do brother bunch respect
Holy hell this is terrible

Jus checkin back in. 2 million+ views in 10 days. Are you f*cking kidding me? TM just proved the old world order is a complete illusion. Singlehandedly. When the revolution comes this guy's gonna write the soundtrack. (BTW, T I was serious. Your merch shop needs a wait list. //justsayin//)
*Showed up late but not leaving this party*  Good job!
Song and music video is Flames 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 keep up the good work Tom, Nova and Hang over gang.
Love how you diss the billboard or who ever keep you the work
Great job 👏🏼 Tom and Nova 👏🏼👏🏼
The Industry is tightly controlled, a mafia like kingdom. Where the artists who fuel it are replaceable because they can make anyone famous. Artists are sexual slaves to the industry big wigs, with an agreement on when they will die.  If they go against the system, they get black cubed "mercs beat em up and hang them from a door knob. Or throw them off a building. An incredible amount of evil in todays world can be traced to Israel and the Rotschyld cult of zion.  It's biblical, its why the world will rise against Israel. And why they'll be destroyed, because their hand is everywhere and built everything
This is the HEAT I’ve been waiting for.   Incredible instrumental, uniqueness, heat in all the verses, zero down time or empty space, and an epic feeling throughout the whole song
Wasnt sure at first but I grew to love the song, its a banger. Great song to pump you up to go workout!
This may be a bold statement out of my mouth …  I hope you known down deep in your heart that God is speaking through you to us , and its beautiful. You’re doing what rock n roll should be , counterculture, just like Christ ! Keep it coming ! Can’t wait to figure out how the hell they’re gonna try to silence you ! Don’t let ‘em ! We believe you !
Freaking awesome! ❤️
This is a serious question. Does Nova do your braids for these videos? Do you braid them yourself? I’m really curious. Great song by the way. And great video.
Nova killed that! Hella talented couple!
Tom I'm praying for you and your crew and I hope your still sober because fame changes so many and hopefully I'm not adding weight to your shoulders but we need leaders to hold us together especially with these trying times 👍
yup! you got it bro!!! LET'S GO BRANDEN
love the truth in your songs
Bump!!! #BBN
I was waiting for the beat to change and some more bars. Good song but felt short & like it was missing something. Keep up the great work.
This is among one of the first rap songs I've really loved! And rap isn't even my thing.
I'm 54 yrs old and I love ur music
Is it just me or is YT censoring the word Fuck lol
I don't know why I torture myself with Tom's mixed messages! Hate the system but buff up my song on itunes... OMG! 🙈 Let's swear but then censor it out! Are You angry or sad? Manic or depressed? We all know the system is trash... We all made it that way and I ask... What are You doing to make it better? Turncoat!
Why cant i find  Boom Bap 101 [on toms channel ?
👍🏻
So many demonic themed videos?? Make me think this guy isn't as independent as he makes out. They love to fool the masses
Dear Mr. tom Macdonald, i been round and it lulled...but now your music instills a sustainable fervor again. check nova, dig them feet in and break your current limit. Again again again.  sincerely-zachary
The beat hits when you said even if you don't make the dollar again,I'm blessed 🥰🥰
If you have to constantly defend yourself, you're insecure.
One of the best and most important artists in the world right there.
fire
🔥🔥
Just to let you know, the collaboration of you and nova is a divine feminine/masculine energy.   If you research this, you will understand that it’s a force of nature. You present the dark angel and she the light (tho we all have both)  She brings the capability to work with you to bring out your best. You allow it and respond and also cherish and protect her gifts. This is tempering and balance and it is the most powerful energy for change on the planet at this time.  It’s already accomplished. You cannot be killed, canceled or divided from this fact. It’s a done deal. I’m living through an experience that’s not completed so I know the energy  Good job and god and goddess bless Doing my deep dive and I’m more than halfway through. Never enjoyed rhythm and poetry because of the shitty self serving industry and how it affects the artists but you are changing my mind slowly. What you create is more than that clearly. Keep it up my friends  Namaste  60 yr old rap hater ••already sharing and talking about you 🖖🏻  love to see you with the Blaire White Project    Rock on
Greetings from zaandam Holland cheers Tom McDonald like the new song peace ✌🍺
Superb !!!
HOG back in building like we never left!🤘
love it!! i want that spiked jacket though! i think you should do a song with tommy vext. that would be awesome!
💥🎯🇨🇦🇺🇸
When God makes a new heavy metal artist but accidentally sets the spawn point in the ghetto lol.
Great song, great video! Yall rock 🤘😝🤘
Hey tom do rap re mix "send in the clowns"
Your girl Nova bringin it bro!!! Incredible!!! Man you are the most awesome team!!!  Congratulations on your success. Squash the haters and live your dream. Thanks for keepin it real…   Hey do something that focuses on the hypocrisy of the border and the elites who don’t want the migrants in their communities… hot topic needs attention!
This guy is just terrible.
It’s Done! Mission is On! Godspeed to your Future Ops. Hoorah, stay Freedom Hungry.
Hi Tom, just heard you for the first time this week. I'm a 50 yr old woman for the stats. I don't usually follow rap music, but in my opinion this is the best, bravest and most authentic work I have heard in my life actually. You are one of the greats imo, a truth speaker and a truly talented artist and should be heard by everyone. Respect and congratulations to you and your amazing team, and please keep going, you are a breath of very much needed fresh air in this current world where lies and bullshit are spread to cover up the goodness.
I'm going crazy on this song issa banger sick prod barz visual everything hog on top

It’s been 1 week and there’s been no better song uploaded yet #facts!
I guess the YouTube algorithm decided, I didn't want to see your new video. I just heard about it through someone else. Even though I'm subscribed/w bells on.
beast mode
Toms a beast  I want a song him and Yelawolf or caskey Tom and jelly roll !!
That was great, I would the best out of the last 3 or 4 songs I've seen from you Bro. Them special effects and crickets were on point 🤘🏻
Banger!
the song is alright, but i don't feel like it's saying anything new. i wish that tom would stay relevant by speaking about new things and not just repeating himself over and over.
I'm curious who you're talking about in this song I have my suspicions but I'm not sure if I'm anywhere near the right ballpark that said love the song love the video Nova and Jared did a phenomenal job as usual there keep up the great work y'all
Another masterpiece, end of story.
You should know that you are becoming historical!! You know what the fuck is goin on in the world and you are one of the few to tell it. You will be a legacy bro. People will speak your name for years.
Let's start a riot

I am 73 years old…and I listen to your raps….love to hear others discuss your songs especially there is a teacher who did a great one with SYSTEM…keep up your raps on our problems….prayers for you and your wife….Argie
This dude steals flows. This would be MGK from wild boy. Every song he bites a flow.
I finally have 1 complaint … this banger was too short …. Other than that .., leveled up 1000 percent …. Straight up rap/hip hop banger … everything was too top and polished it could’ve been .. video .. off the damn chain .. VFX .. Hollywood needs to call your team .. loved it .. and that last bar .. damn bro ..💯🔥… that was like corona burst from sun 🔥🔥🔥🔥..
Excellent video....
All I’m hearing is 🦗🦗🦗🦗🦗 #HOG4LIFE
Sunday riot!
I love the crickets in the backdrop of this song. fuckin legit bro!

Can someone tell me what is whatsapp? Every time when I comment on a fellow musician’s page I get a whatsapp comment. I am an old ass musician and don’t know about all the bullshit.
I like it's a song and it's not about politics even tho I like when he diss politics but I don't care for the lyrics of this song but background music was amazing

Yes!!!
Did your parents grow up with Jordan Peterson in Alberta?
As a fan of metal i say salute bro excellent work
Tom MacDonald doesn’t believe Jesus is our Lord and Savior.  He said it himself———> https://youtu.be/DCBGJNFKdME  The blind leading the blind.

Tom,  I am 66yo.  I have been waiting , subconsciously, for an Artist like you.  So Many dimensions of artistry.  I write poetry, you excercise possibly 20 concurrent literary techniques in your writings and execution. Rhyme schemes integrated with sophisto-natural Semantics.  True. The WORLD shall know you and THINK.  Thank you.  On your albums.  Ps, saw you on the Youtube Shorts.  Truely BaddAss.  P
As a lot of peeps have said, we older gen, me 45, hubs 55…. We love your vibe man! We are metal, rock and pop lovers… never dug rap. You bring it all together in an amalgamation thats tougher than steel. We love your music, your message, and we love that you tell the studios to go eff themselves and do your own thing. Other performers need to take notes!!
YESS TOM!!🤪
This is a song for Brian's everywhere
This is the one.
Sick!
Rioting our hearts.
Great Job Once Again! God Bless
Ha ha Debra Harry, Blondie, started rap
My bf introduced me to ur music and I LOVE IT!!! He wasnt kidding- u r the GOAT
McDonald, like Bob Dylan, has the ability to mix words in such a way that it causes the cells in a listener's brain to work more powerfully and Generate mental clarity and some really incredible insights.
Tom macdonald and Nova and his independent team, only way to live , true freedom. 98% of poeple in the america, will never know what it is and what true freedom is. It sad
Yes, that man is awesome
Then tell me when the name dropping will begin....
Timcast and the group told me to check this out so here I am and again Tom dose it again.
dope jam Big Man. I would like to see you featured at the WWF. Maybe a lead intro for Steve Austin or any of the patriotic aligned Matt-crobat. I remember when you hit the canvas, those were the good old days. You do you, cause it is hella awesome. Superstars need to shine even if its from the darkness.
@tommacdonald 🔥🔥🔥✌️✌️✌️
Tom your my favorite rock star with exception to ac dc   Thanks for music this is your best yet  Awesome
diablo 2 necromancer look.
LETS START A RIOT!!

Hi,tom.In China,we call you like Lu Xun,a great patriotic writer.Your song shows your love for America.Hope you can get in bilibili.
Tom, please make a song about how Disney give us a black Ariel with a African rasta hair! And we all must accept this cuz if we don't accept a black Ariel, we are racist 🤦🏻‍♂️
I'm a fan, but this one kinda left me cold. Just felt like a lot of ego.
Tell em!! Mainstream SUCKS!!!
Keep traveling the road less traveled and you will have my support!
Not a fan of the music sorry but wanted to say what you said about your girlfriend was really touching to read.
Tom macdonald stepped up the rapgod level to a whole new era I see a lot more record breaking boundaries fs he's going to the craziest level of amazingness
Tom....... keep the killer tracks coming bro. Don't worry about the haters, and the ones who want to control you, and tell you what you should be putting out there! That's why you always have the ever growing fan base that you have now, because your not a sell out like the others. Hopefully you do a gig, in the land of down under.
Sucks and love your stuff

But you are popular (pop) ?
I wanna know who this is directed at
All I wanted for my birthday tomorrow was to see Riot go #1!! Thank you for the best birthday present I could have asked for! HOG 4 Life!!
Saturday riot.
This world loves death and wonder why there’s so much of it in the world when you see a story on the news but endorse it in a rap song…the hypocrisy of it all.
That m'y éyes bro
Bro peaked in 2020
Wow, great work Tom (&all that have helped)… You got a bunch of rappers looking at them self in the mirror, wondering where they went wrong.. maybe not financially, but they lost the soul trying.  Should I tell them? Should I?  Bc Tom doesn’t glorify drugs, sex, rims, and garbage that rots the youth.. Just truth!
Mhmm...
I was just watching  tiktok and DAX was live I got bored lol 😆  so I put on your new jam "RIOT" and I had a crazy Idea! Tom macdonald  "Riot" remix with DAX? That track would just be stupid  good! Just saying. Much luv.  - CORNELIUS
hello to those who read this, I take 1 minute of your time to tell you that Jesus loves you with all his heart and that he calls you to follow him, because he loves you so intensely that he is put on the cross to wash away your sins because he loves you more than anyone in this world and Jesus Christ has a plan for you and know that he is coming soon and this world of depravity is over the point of disappearing
Love it
Love some one speaking the truth, never stop!
TOM:  Please do a song called “Sanctuary Cities”  about all these fake as cities that pretend to care about immigrants, ONLY TO SHIP THEM OFF TO OTHER COMMUNITIES.
I ❤you. You are like another of my favorites back in the day, except you are…current. Anyone with a platform who has the balls to call out the real life idiocracy today has my full support.
Please add lyrics so I can sing along!
I grew up listening to a lot of rock and metal and still do, I've always hated rap music mainly because of what they rap about but recently I've been mainly listening to a lot of your music along with people like Struggle Jennings, Adam Calhoun, Moonshine Bandits and many others, you speak truth brother and I love it!!! 🤘🤘🤘
riot!!
Let’s start a riot!
My fav bar... White Pac in the flesh :D  HOG fan4life

Pay attention young man.
Nova needs to sing!!!! Love all you do. Nova needs to Sing!!!!!!
Tom we WISH every day was Friday.  If you dropped every Friday I would lose it lmao!  Big love brother

https://youtu.be/6zJbpSdjh-I
I put the playback speed at .75 and it sounded so hard. Then I sped it up to 1.25 and it's sounded sick that way too. Don't ask me why. Lol. I slowed it down so I could pay attention to the lyrics then I wondered what it would sound like sped up. People are sleepin on this one though. These numbers should be tripled by now
Strait fire 🔥.  Going to be one of my top favorites.
Damn......💯💯💯
Bro, you are so shadow banned! This has been out a week now and I found it on TikTok because YouTube never sent a notification about it, actually I have not seen anything from you in a couple of weeks. Hell I figured they banned you for a week or two for something (I know I just went straight to the worst case, but it’s America in 2022). Awesome video, just hate it took me a week to find it
Timcast
Tom you ever thought about putting K.A.A.N on a track I the man is talented but I dont know how his view would be when it comes to what your making. I think y'all would kill a track your stand out with his speed... Banger
Finally some real awake new music!!!! Right on Tom
😍
asome
I want more philosophy. More poetry. More intelligence. More daring. I love you, Tom. Stay humble.
This beat is Dope
Another bad a@@ song keep doing what your doing and don't listen to the idiots they are just jealous that you have fans that they only wish they could have. Your music knows no genre so Screw the music industry! And keep making great music.
As a metal fan and electronic producer myself. You pull this stuff off man. Hats off to you. Ain't just the lyrics I'm hearing.
Doing it yet AGAIN! I just Love you 💜 keep on keepin on

Anybody here who likes Tom and hasn’t heard or listened to sKitz Kraven you don’t know what you’re missing.
Anybody here who likes Tom and hasn’t heard or listened to sKitz Kraven you don’t know what you’re missing.
Tom turning into nu-metal with that crunchy guitar. Loving it.
Love all Tom's music. He really likes his middle fingers 🤣
The bottom line on reality still gets filled by The System for me with your work. And I gotta say, your lyrics have topped my list of Wordsmith, shared with people the greatest in the world, you step to the full plate on your own steam, and not one of the others can claim the same thing.
Another great one!
Riot

I never liked rap music til I discovered you. It’s like poetry your lyrics and you’re a genuine authentic character with integrity.

We 💕 love u keep it 100 💯 keep up the good work NOVA & TOM TAKING OVER THE 🌎🌍
Yoo Tom THIS THE HARDEST SONG You've Done❗💯🔥 Independent King
Listened to this a cpl..dozen times now😉👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼 love it!
Hey Tom I recently discovered you and I became a fast fan. I learned a bit about your history and I really resonate with your story because I went through childhood where booms wore falling over our heads. How ever I persisted and I grew up to be resistant to many problems that faced me. Now I'm 27 recently moved from Serbia to Romania and got married with the girl that is truly a blessing to me. Eventually I will realize my own dream's and you might hear about me one day,   But for now I will enjoy your music and admire your struggles cheating you on in the background, because not any person can go trough the things you went through. Stay true to your self and don't ever back down from the challenge, I tell you this because I can see greatness in you and I know the pain.  Hope that this message gives you strength in bring the riot in 🤟🤟🤟

You and Nova are so talented in so many ways. It's great to see that you have stayed true to yourself and won't change to please people. Seeing your work ethic,the belief in yourself,and putting family first is something more people need to do/show more these days.
Um.....OK so.... I made a metal hip hop hybrid beat called Riot and uploaded it about 4 months ago. Granted, this beat slaps harder than mine, but.....wtf is happening right now 🤣

Love the music!
One day imma perfect my lyrics and I pray for you to live long so we can colab
Nobody can top this song or telling the music industry and the mumble rappers to fuck off 💯
I honestly think Riot, apart from the music video, is really bland. The lyrics feel very slapped together and uninspired, and the mixing and the beat, despite the title being “RIOT” is very boring. Honestly, it feels like you put a lot more work into your lyrics and beats a while ago, but now that you have a very loyal fan base, you’re not trying as hard anymore. Actually, I know you work very hard, but you release albums so often with most of the songs in those albums feeling uninspired. You’re focusing more on quantity than quality and I gotta say, Gravestones is your best album. Us Against the World was such a disappointment. I hope this comment doesn’t come across as a hate comment. I’m just trying to give constructive criticism because I know you can do a lot better than Riot.
If anyone deserves to be number 1 it is this man!! Yall are fucking amazing! Fuck the industry. It's all trash anyways. I've pulled back from listening to mainstream shit and have focused on people like you because YALL THE REAL ONES!!!! If anything, the industry should strive to be like you and not the other way around but they gonna learn!  #HOG
Thanks for another banger Tom. Screw the system. When the demons come knocking, call on us brother. We shall fight them together.
That was phenomenal! The crickets had me rolling!
lol trash
Best one yet!!!
I frigging love your music, and I will always try to help when it comes to saying the hell with the music industry! Your music is fire ALWAYS!!! I've got all your cds and I bump them on repeat.
Once again you did that thing homie. Love from the Caribbean. Keep spreading that knowledge. Let who have eyes to see and ears to hear, let them see and hear
You weren't kidding, special effects are amazing! Love the sound
Its mad how they put all this together go look on his tiktok
You are blessed
Screw the music industry!!
Damn tom yall just keep bringing the fire to us I'm proud of you guys keep it up

Better then Eminem… Nah not even close men I’m sorry
I am not into hip hop/Urban but this song has been in my mind since it launched. I just discovered this artist a few weeks ago and it has me sold. Here's to success and please keep doing amazing work.
Screw the music industry!!!!
Screw the system!
Doing my part to get this back in the algorithm. 👍🏼
Love it tom! Boost of engery bro you deserve it 💯🤟
💙
I can relate to a lot of your music, I'm 43 and feel 20 again every time I listen to you, The world is so blinded by white lies and have been sheeple for many many decades and appreciate the facts that finally someone is speaking up, should make a song about who created our system and why it is the way it is, Karl marx and the industrial revolution on how he created the lower class, mid, and upper class systems we know today, and Charles Milgram, the king of conformity and how his science is used today on a mass scale. The failures of science that segregated society, slavery never went away, it got smarter. Keep em coming I love your artistry/ music!
Screw the music industry, tom is a king!!!
Screw the music industry! 🤘💚🤙
Put you six feet deep, that’s a under ground rapper.  Lmao. Sick
Fuck the system
🔥🔥🔥🔥
2:38 8 seconds of "bars" and 2:30 of a hook on repeat and some autotune thrown in for the hipsters. Caught on a flyball at centre field on the warning track with this one.
Getting cypress hill vibes from this. Loving it
This guy, legendary.
The first song I heat from you was snowflakes and at first I didn’t like your music but after I listened to it for a while it kinda grew on me now I’m a bigger fan then my dad

This hits so HARD! The effects! The music! The Industry can try, but they will never reach this peak! ❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥 Ps. I own reptiles and keep cricketers to feed them, so it took me a while to realize the cricket sounds were part of the song, and not an escaped insect 🤣 This adds a whole different level of badass! HOG till I die!

Because of Tom MacDonald, Nova Rockefeller, they have helped make it easier to become a successful Independent artist. Just follow their business plan!
Screw the music industry!! Tom you are amazing!! Best artist 🙌🏻✨💖
Awesome video VFX were really cool. Independent artist looking better major label, high budget output. Keep on kicking them in the ass.
👏🏻
Great to see LGBTQ+ artists finally getting recognized. Props to you Tom!!
keep it up Nova.. you are killing it
You guys killed it on the visuals on this. I live the effects you have started adding.. they are great
I love when you flex and let them know, but the sharability is lower.. however I dont mind commenting

First off i prefer heavy music but you are my favorite artist all around  for your lyrics and beats. I grew up listen to eminem and im sorry if I offend people by saying that you are the best rapper i ever heard. You stay true to who you are, and that means alot in a time when everyone is scared to speak their mind. Keep being tom and and i will always support you and your music, because there is no one like you and no one that sounds like you. Thanks for another hit tom

RIOT!
Tom just posted this on his YT channel under the Community tab:    "Today is the last day they our views, streams & downloads on “Riot” count toward Billboard. Get your iTunes/Amazon download before midnight and share the video! Love y’all ❤"  I don't use Amazon Music, or iTunes and don't intend to, but I bought Riot on Amazon Music, made an apple account, and bought it on iTunes anyway.  Go do the same and help Tom give the middle finger to the industry!  Riot is currently #1 on iTunes top Hip-Hop/Rap songs (lets keep it there) and in the 23rd spot overall, lets get it to the top!
Love this song
🔥😎🔥
Screw the music industry!!! INDEPENDENT ARTISTS BABY
Power en love from Portugal keep going
I don't think I've ever heard crickets as a hook before.  Badass effects too!
Tom you are amazing!! Screw the music industry, you empower us with your words! Mad respect to you, Nova and fam.
#1 RIOT!
Screw the music industry!!!
Only thing I didn't like was the censorship
Great song. You really flexed your skills as a rapper, as you always do, but this time around you gave your haters nothing to chew on. Not to say you shouldn’t give em a bite, but this bit can BUMP. Keep at it!
Screw the music industry!!!! 🖕🏼🖕🏼

Not sure how many times I've listened to this song.  My only complaint... not long enough.  😉 I could listen to an instrumental of it on a continuous loop (love that guitar).  Great song Tom.    You and ACal both killed the beats on your songs.  Oh yeah, and as you requested on Instagram, "Screw the music industry "

Took me a couple of views to work out the message but I think I have it now - basically a FU to the curated music 'industry' in a 'I made it without you fuc'kos'  way so suck on that - yeah I can see that and kudos to Timmy to making it in the way he did (basically by being very good at what he does (with Nova who is skilled AF at the videos)  and working hard, rather than being promoted by multi million dollar companies along with coke and icecream).

Phenomenal....
What makes you a right wing clown? Let’s get you and a klan member in a room to talk politics and different social and cultural issues. Let’s see what you disagree on.
Idc what anyone says. This man clearly has the mind, blood, heart and bones of a *true* libertarian, in him. That’s what I see.
I love you Tom but this isn't your style it doesn't compliment your tone, keep to the better beats this sounds record label owned
Dat riff tho!  Super dope!
“put you you six feet deep thats an underground rapper” HOLY SHIT
You might not ever read this Tom, and I'm sure you already know this, but anyone talking shit about your choruses do not know shit about music. I, on the other hand, love and vibe with all of your music. #HOG4LIFE Fuck the music industry, so ready for a banger CD from the independent GOAT, I feel like your CD purchases are about to go through the fucking roof! 🤗❤️ Stay inspired, you deserve it because you took the stairs to the moon.

Hey Tom, I’m a 74 year old disabled woman with no house or credit that served in the Vietnam war while pregnant. I just wanted to say you’re my 83rd favorite white rapper.
This energy is everything. I’m blessed. Keep it up legend. 🏆
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ephesians 5:11🙏
Hey Tom I bet you won't say it to their face😆 it seems like alot of your music is directed at someone who isn't mentioned  by name but  their definitely beneath you but you definitely dont look down 😆
This is what this country needs. Love it.
Let's start a riot!
you claim Christian but play demon hypocrite
My 6 year old favorite artist is Tom Mcdonald

Brooo you are killing 🔥🔥🔥🔥🤞🏽
You were great until you started throwing Illuminati symbols everywhere
Lit As Always!!🔥🔥🔥H.O.G
This is horrible music. I just don’t understand how anyone could say it’s good.
Yo tom u know that post you said who wins a fight either you or the guy from mortal combat to honest I know u would win not because of the powers because you would probably offend him 😂 love you tom
Way too many Blacks in London.
This song is true Tom, everyone knows your what people are listening to, the so called mainstream artist can't reach your talent, your style or your genius, I'm so glad I hear your music, it gives me true Hope.
CATDADDY BADASS! Been off the grid just caught this off of Steve Knight’s channel ! Total KICKASS!
I love your music!  My son sent me a link a while ago...   And I can not go a day without hearing one of your songs in my playlist!  😁 keep up the good work!
glad you got to do this with your family. my sister is my best friend and I love that about you bro....
...not sure about this one, Chief
"White pac in the flesh" yes sir.
I like this song but why do you have to have an upside down cross on your mask?!😑 for someone who denies being part of the “Illuminati “ “satanist” whatever you wanna call it, you sure don’t mind contradicting yourself by doing shit like that.
I love the direction Tom is going!   ROCK/RAP/RAGE
Hi Tom mc Donald I’m 14 and I’m your biggest fan
You make amazing music my guy keep it up.
I listened to this song a few times and rather than be negative, put this on the B side of a B side.  It seemed forced and the lyrics were haphazardly stuck together.  I am a HOG for life so remember your true friends say the tough stuff to your face and nice things behind your back.  If that's not enough it's my opinion and it's totally worthless.  Even 2Pac had B-sides...Digital Underground.
🤘
Hey Tom my name is Ryan Ballinger I was wondering why you don't do a concert? I think that would be something I would go to!
I'll fight u one on one bergenline tonight 911ampm stop snitching
Brilliant stuff Tom!!! I love this. The video is out of control amazing!!   Give my love to the fabulous and beautiful Nova!! #HOG4LIFE!!!!
Lets start a Riot!
Nominee for hardest beat of the year, the lyrics are a bonus.
† We are all born with a sinful nature. To live eternally in paradise and escape eternal torment in hell, we must accept the sacrifice that Jesus made on the cross.  Even though Jesus is God, He came to earth to be a sacrifice for us so that we could live with Him, God the Father and God the Holy Spirit forever. We can't save ourselves by doing good works. Only faith in what Jesus did will save us. Just by believing in our hearts that Jesus died for us, we are saved eternally. It can't be lost no matter what. After that, we trust God to do good works in us. It's all about what Jesus did, not what we have done or will do.  ...if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.                                           †  Romans 10:9
I love seeing grandma's and grandpa's in the comment section. Saying how much they love Tom! ❤️😁🤘
HAVE NEVER HERD SOMETHING LIKE THIS BUT SOMEHOW KNEW ALL THE LYRICS WITH OUT HEARING THE SONg keep UP THE GREAT WORK TOM
Voice sounds so much like Madchild in this one.
Fire. Joyner is an older independent rapper who came up huge too. Props to you both and anyone that strives for self success! Powerful lyrics bro. Much appreciation and respect
Wow. Very original. You will not go mainstream. Breaking news here
Best Rapper Ever, no joke.
Yet again another brilliant song congrats.

Awesome Video! Wouldnt expect Anything Less Tom! Go down in History for Your Lyrics and Videography! Climbed to Top as an Independent!
He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.   (1 John 3:8) - Repent. Jesus Christ, the Lord of Judgment, is coming soon.
Can we please give a shout out to #NovaRockafeller, she directing better than kanye and khaled combined, it’s like I like “Tom and the underground thing” but #NovaRockafeller is the serious serious talent I mean the directing the video production, i mean it says Tom “produced the beat” so ok but I mean without her he wouldn’t sound nearly as good, she’s like his “Dre” and I don’t say that lightly but I’m not political and I hate the delusional people who make Toms music possible bc he’s speaking truth to facts, but to make that sound “cool” you got to have a great director/producer so hands down to Nova! 🔥🔥🔥🔥 both of you 🔥
Is #Novarockafeller gonna produce other artists? Bc damn

Love it Tom. Very glad Tom & Adam nova are highlighting this woke war on Western civilisations mostly by bossy  Neonazi anti Male , anti freedom, anti baby career girls,  Feminazis who dominate every profession & office now.see Author  Douglas Murray on here another rare brave guy.
i just wanna say this when the mac lethal stuff went down i stood with mac only cause i loved his videos so much but your music in a way freed me from this chains my head was in and i know you wont reply to this or even see it but if you had a way to talk to me on social media give me some pointers to help me be a independent artist id apricate it a lot anyway love your music and keep up the great work!
Lets start a Riot!

AHH YESSS! YOU KEEP DOING IT BRO!! I swear, every time it gets better!!  Much love  -wicked huge fan of your fcking beautiful art! From Maine!
The Dooooooooooooooopest 🤜🏼💥🤛🏼 But I’m quite certain youtube is skewing your numbers 😤😡
But sure if he's dissing a person or the entire corporate music circus
Absolutely next level
eh... I like it.  TLDR: Your underground, and one of the biggest You have loyal fans, that would metaphorically kill for you. You are the shit. Other rappers suck. a riot breaks out everywhere you go because you bring that type of energy. You dont care what people think.  You used to say much more, but you said it over and over and over again. at least this is sort of different, though I am pretty sure, every album you drop has at least 2 tracks with the same bullet points, being listed off above (very creatively I might add) though.
Don't let this distract you from the fact that Hector is gonna be running 3 Honda Civic's with spoon engines. On top of that he just came into Harry's and ordered 3 t66 turbo's with NOS's and a Motec System Exhaust.
This is what my ears need to hear. Love this music!
Figured it out and bought it! You're welcome. Keep doing what you're doing and spreading truth to your ever growing fan base! AloooooooHa!
I just gotta day tom you're videos and music never seizes to amaze me, every song is amazing you deserve to be on top man!! every single single/album cover is fucking sick man, never seizes to amaze me in that department, even your older songs are just as dope as the new ones! keep up the good work man!!
Fuck yes getting me hyped up at 2 am keep it up Tom
I personally know a dozen people who listen to this shit. Tom, you come to SLC, you might not sell it out, but you'll make a profit. People would flock from a hundred mile radius if they get word that you're coming. We'll take time off work to come and support you.
Genius!    As always, keep them coming.
Talk about the Sudden Adult Death Syndrome in your next song.  They're messaging that young, fit people dropping dead is the equivalent of people getting depressed in winter.  They're sick!
New contacts? Love em. Love the video and song. Another one for the collection. Thank u for bad ass music.
Fking great sh1t as always. Tom’s videos and messages always rock! Red pilled as a mud a-fuka.
Yep Yep
I've loved him since the very beginning.. song had me mesmerized!!! Why so quiet?! ❤️❤️
Amazing song
Who did he diss?
Can't believe my grandma's favorite rapper is Tom Macdonald. Sure he's very poetic in his songs and talks truth, but the fact im seeing even more older people who love him, this is a true accomplishment. Someone who can pull in the young and the elderly, both of which is getting true words. These newer age rappers we see rap bout nothing but drugs and money, yet this one is against that shit. We gotta respect that, and see that this guy is barely talked about. Where's the radio station saying "this guy is reaching out to multiple groups of people with his songs"  He's being fucked with in this system, they don't WANT him on the top. That'll change the way this world works, it'll change the way we people communicate and live with each other.  In my full honest opinion, Tom Macdonald should be way more known then he is. That's not a fact and I won't say it is because it's not. It is an opinion, but I can't be the only one with it.  We all need to see, fans or not, where Tom Macdonald was many years ago, and WHO he is now. Human, yes. But a true human.
Than you Tom and Nova....you both have amazing talent...
Keep on speaking the truth.
Cringe af
🔥🔥🔥
FKN Epic!
Keep cranking out those sick tracks!

Hey 65 year young Black Woman and I’m all for this about time PLEASE DONT STOP
Nice but bit short
👍
Why are you censored 😕 You should be be able to cuss and shit 😕
#rememberSlimShady
I literally check iTunes every Friday for a new song to add to my playlist 😊
Possible rap song of the year right here!??? Honestly this is one of Tom's best songs ever I think :)
mad talent.
Awesome
I've been a hip hop fan for most of my life but haven't been listening as much lately to my favorites because the became woke. You are the voice we need in this genre!
Firrrreeee!! Yet again! Im not even surprised anymore. Every song you drop, I love! I really, really enjoyed the new sound and mashup of genres! Hope to hear more like this in the future... if not, that's cool too. I'm a fan... been a fan... gonna stay a fan.   I hate when people... 'fans'.... try to box the artist in. People need to sit down. Take the journey the artist decides to traverse, and enjoy!   My only complaint... I wish it was longer!
Listened 3 different ways; sober, buzzed, stoned. All 3 pointed the same direction. Great skit/song. The only unsettle was autotune. Doesn't matter but you have a great voice please use it. You are always real let that voice be real too. Autotune is for adolescent going through puberty or grown up people with no confidence in their vocals. My opinion ya'll can suck it
Hell yes.
Tom you need to get with Kid Rock and figure out how he does it. I'm sure he'd help you to get around the Where's of the Music Industry.
It had me unsubscribed from you freaking YouTube!
🔥🔥🔥
NNIICCEE
Bro! Tom…this is 🔥 BRO…so much hype in this song. Im starting to say this is my favorite SONG from you… going to be hard between this song and THE SYSTEM!!
I can watch this over and over
Let’s gooooooooooo! Wanna see yall in those suits. Particularly Luke Rudkowski in a pimp suit. Lmao. Seriously man. You’re killin it. No chart no numbers needed to prove that. You and Nova are a dynamic duo! Love it. Never before has this genre music made me cry- empathizing with more than one song has left me in tears. Love your work. Love you. Chin up back straight. Fuck the haters and keep pressin’ on! Prayers for you and us all!
Dude u nd nova r an amazing team... <3 <3 ur music with the videos YASSSSSS PLZZZZZZ
Keep coming back again and again ❤
WHY SO QUIET? (crickets. 🤣)
Love you brother just bought some stuff from you my fav is woke
You are a musical genius. I cant compare to other rappers, because I dont listen to them. I dont like that kind of music. You sir, are most like Meatloaf. Have you heard “two out of three aint bad” or “paradise by the dashboard lights”. Most of his music is heavy metal-like, which I dont like. But then he whips out tunes so different, and they are spectacular. Two more of his, that are well worth a listen… “I would do anything for Love, but I wont do that” and “you took the words right out of my mouth” those four songs are on permanent repeat, with a little Cheap Trick thrown in at the end. The two best bands of the mid 1970’s. And you are right up there with them!
Never stop.  I love everything you and Nova produce.  Hangover gang for life.
Bro it's sad I was born  in this baby ass Gen  that people get mad and try to cancel  people  for speaking  fax and there mind  bro tom mcdoneld    I love tom because  he only speaks fax about this fuck up Gen  and and about politics  and lgbtq  just saying mad respect  to him
Tom, I found your music by mistake, but at 66 years old i see your hitting it out of the park! Its putting out the truth with a shock factor! Keep it going!
** Must listen to with decent speakers or headphones with bass. **
Sounds like Yelawolf if Yelawolf was from the north
Barsssssssssssssss🔥
The video is amazing.
Calling out the wolves in sheep's clothing and just the people want to brainwash. Dare to go against the grain
Shadow band is an understatement you have to look you up to get all my feed
Yo Tom why don't you go after some of these liberal lame rappers everywhere starting with that douchebag M&M
Lets start a Riot!

Riot sounds like quiet bro.we don't want broken homes.no more broken bones
life long metal-head here great to hear some distorted guitar coming  through. good shit!
Tom I've been subscribed for a while now.  I've been listening to your catalog, buying your CDs and loving the music.  As a rule I haven't liked rap at all since the days of RUN DMC, Cool J and even back to the Sugar Hill Gang.  I was an 80s kid.  Fake Woke caught me and I began to binge your music.  I've been a fan ever since and even shared you with my son.  I was constantly hating his music from people like KSI and other modern "so called" musicians.  He loves your music as well and I'm glad he does.  I've even gotten some of his buddies hooked.  Just know you are absolutely appreciated, loved and prayed for.  Keep going.  Keep spitting the truth and this old Rush fan and rocker will keep supporting you and loving what you do.  Peace and Love to you and Nova and all HOG.
Pretty dope!
Hope you don’t hate gays cause you have gay fans listen to your music all the time when working
Father of two, 42 Hamilton On. So happy for all the success my friend. You are an inspiration to so many, never stop.  This song is a banger, and whoever you are speaking to should sit down .
Thats right Brother call em all out. You make music. Good music transcends genre and labels. Keep doin what you do. I’m an old metal head and i love your music.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥🙌
I normally never have issue with the songs or videos you all do. But there is something about this one that just seems phoned in. Like Nova found a new graphic and put it on repeat. An the lyrics felt like your heart just wasn't in it. Hope you wanted honesty if not well I know you have on your big boy pants. Sorry wont blow smoke up your ass.
Love your music Tom one of my favorite rappers. I love that you're awoke and speak your mind and the truth. Your a great inspiration king.
gj
I’ve been flowing you Tom for awhile and your shits always fire but this is trash and doesn’t even sound like your style.. just being honest
Need more people speaking the truth uncensored honestly I'd me proud to introduce your music to my daughter when she is at a decent age to understand. Keep doing your thing your way 🤘
Yo bro I’m 60 years old I live in Australia I wish I heard of you earlier you’re a bloody legend keep the truth out there 🎙👏🤙🏻
A few days ago I listened to you for the first time,  and now I can't get enough. You're an amazing person and artist.
Shared again on all my "media"! Want #1 for this so bad! ❤
If my manz can do that in his backyard just imagine what he could do with a full studio and production team. Dang.
*Banger versatile song you can play this in a car without sounding like a political activist but still has a message.*
It is a fact!! The more you play this song the harder it hits.. one of your best 👌
This Bangs, i love it Tom Macdoald, keep making bangers bro
You putting off some Double Dragon Energy!
i cant take this guy serious kind of a cornball
When that chorus drops 🔥🔥🔥
Awesome song Tom 🙂💫🌺💐
The crickets-sound got me, adds so much impact to that line. Who wanna go down in silence? Not me! #MadTalentHere
Someone is sending spam using your name Tom
💯💯
💯TRUTH for Our Current Times 🎶Keep SpeakingSinging Your Soul @Tom Mac Donald. ..I’m A Open Minded Grandma and TRUTh Seeker and was Told To Listen to this ..💯✌🏻I’m A About Lyrics and Words❤️Wishing Much Success ✌🏻
Okay so when at work and someone speaks on ignorant stuff, I try to speak what's true and factual. But because I'm white I'm written off and called goofy and racist..(wife's black btw) I was losing my mind. Then literally yesterday dude at work said hey you're not the only one who thinks this way. He showed me your music.... THANK YOU TOM!!! I'm a new fan for life... Stay true, and keep going bruh.
The song is incredible. I couldn't believe the VFX. Thor meets Ghost Rider! And that guitar... Dang.
Reminds me of young Eminem when he didn’t give a fk
This is what Fm Mekha wish he was
Yo, how the fuck do you just keep getting better and better!
Whoop Whoop
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Brother you just keep KILLIN it. ☠️💯🇺🇸
I listen to metal mostly,  but this song hits!! NICE WORK TOM!
Just found you from Timcast IRL video,  he shouted you out! Great song!!
❤️
I like almost all of Tom's music but let's be real that song suck
Safety law in Illinois may cause industry to regrip forcefully since the part your in caters to prison im mean im probably just stupid but I feel like there more desperate thn ever hope u not one of them I don't think u are but iv been wrong more thn right
Guys...  So Halloween is coming up... Guess what i'm making for the occasion... a Tom Mcdonald Live action horror/Comedy skit About a woke supernatural Slasher that tries to lecture me  on wokeness and Tom Mcdonalds music is his kryptonite. It's called Tom Mcdonald Ruins Halloween Sub with notifications if you want to see it on time lol  If i can find a clown mask The slasher will be a Clown for a subtle dig at wokeness  If toms see's it I would D I E  The skit opens with me jamming to t"Clown World" by Tom Mcdonald which gets the slashers attention lol
Saw this on Stevie Knight and had to come watch it myself, this one is insane man!
This shit is fireeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
@ 1:08 that was a bad ass transition.
Love the new song bro keep coming with it I blow it up
Great artist but this is not it stay to what got you here
This is hard damn.. I love the Rock vibe
Fan det bästa jag hört👍🏽
You buy views
Another banger
It’s fire 🔥🔥
My 14 yr old thinks I’m listening too Eminem like these kids can’t hear real music these days….
🔥
I only listened to this because of TIM POOL.
I don t know why it gives me old Eminem and old Lil Wayne vibes 👏❤🔥🙌
I just started listening to Tom in the last month. I have bought all his records and am actively playing them for everyone I meet. It is stunningly amazing how just about everyone I have played them for loves them. I started listening for the political songs, but found the truly amazing stuff is Castles, F&*K Cancer, and Scars. However I try not to listen to Naz when others are around, it makes me cry like a baby. It is wonderful how Tom makes you tap into all of your emotions as easily as he makes you think with his political songs.
🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 Banger can t stop listening
I have eclectic taste in music and don't listen to much rap but Tom is absolutely Authentic, I can't get enough .
You bud, I'm 49 been hearing your music for several years now... keep making statements facts matter young brother
Lets start a Riot!!
Yes so different and dope at same time
https://youtube.com/channel/UCz1MMwws5MBrl0ilOL_yPvw
Roses are red, violets are blue, Tom's the goat and I'm sorry but it's true 🤣
We're gonna start a RIOT
Haters gonna hate, they can deny he has something great, but they won't stop him, he's the goat. #hangovergang
😁😁😁
😃😃😃
🙃🙃🙃
💥💥💥
I've been watching as many reactions to this song as I can find, and i haven't found a negative one yet!! Even Stevie Knight gave you high praise, and he's usually one that doesn't like your hooks, I was actually shocked to hear his reaction to it. Your blowin up brother! Nova & Jared, everyone that I've watched has given high praise on the video as well!!
🤩🤩🤩
He is the BOMB 💣.......
Damn bro. Number 6. Congrats 🔥❤
Ehh ... tad bit over  rappers telling us how great they are ..  you were on fire tom but this is a bucket of water 💧
I hope you double your 3.28 million subscribers every 3 MONTHS. After a year you will be known as the bravest song artist out there and also for your original content and the fact you are addressing this 3D paradigm. Light and Hope for us all. Amen
I don't believe these numbers!  There is no way this song only has 2.1 million views! Tom has over 3 million subscribers I've listened at least 20 times myself. So they are lying 🤥
You do Music with a purpose, years i havent heard music that had a message
#HOG FAMMMMM!   let’s gooo. y’all killed it as usual! 😎
That was dope af
Tom you're a legend
The part "6 feet deep that's an underground rapper" is soooo dope
Fake watch ⌚️ 🤣🤣
Independent legend, true
Why so quiet babyyyyy? Hahaha
I can run for days bumping this
This is a running track dude
Amiazing
Best
Dope
If you there, your muscles. Ahhh hunn
Tom's getting buffed
Fire man good job
Tim beanie man Pool sent me... you have cool music glad I discovered you
Hey Tom, I don't know if you read comments very often but I wanted to thank you. I'm injured, I fell out of a truck after unloading it at work, fell about 5 feet total and now I'm in a boot with a fracture in my leg. I keep getting the ring around by my workman's comp people despite them "being there for me" and you're giving me the confidence to stand up and stay on top of them. I won't stand for getting fucked around with. Hang Over Gang forever.
Tom’s got me legitimately reconsidering my distaste for rap music.
Dude.  You blow me away.  You have a gift and I’m so glad I found your art… kudos and blessings to your family and crew ✨🙏🌀🌿🕊 as a 65 yr young , Jesus following Dead Head gma I have missed the music of the day talking about the s@#t of our times… I pray your music becomes louder than the bs of our crumbling society.  Keep up the good work… !!!!!!
This dude is straight fire!!!
Let's Start A Riot!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The REAL voice for the people....Believe it....
When you coming to Florida?????....We need ya down here Brother...
The T-shirts in Merch are FKN killer....I want em ALL!!!! Great job!!!
KA-FKN-BOOM!!!!  He set it off right in your face!!!!...AGAIN!!!! Like I said....You can't touch him. Pure REALITY and TRUTH ...Drive on my Brother....Godspeed to the HOG CREW...and those who support THIS Movement !!!! Much Respect..Love...and Loyalty from St Petersburg Florida....
Please haters make tom mad 🤟 he spits are 💥 🔥 🔥 yeah talk tom! I'm excited  🤟
Tom’s music is best when he isn’t singing about himself.
Trump maxed out stadiums, Hilary couldn't fill half a school basketball court and Biden never left his basement...
Shout out to the Hangover Gang😱🤘🤘
Like this guy
Nothing ruins a song like censorship. Guys lit though.
Do it up Tom! You have audience to truly start a revolution! I'm the same age as you, and I 100% feel the truth you spitting and I'm so glad you have a loud talented voice to use that free speech and get your words out there for all of us who truly still think with our own minds!
I love the message but I can't do the music I don't like rap I hate it but good on you keep it up thank you, we need a billion more like you or willing to stand up.... I'm contemplating that right now..... If y'all see a piece of s*** run for president that's me, I'll do what I say and I'll say what I'm going to do but I'll probably get clapped within the first 30 days, God forbid we have an honest politician anywhere.... 🤣😂🤣😂😂😂😂
love the music my 8 year old jams to you all the time keep it up more and more will listen
COME TO TACOMA/SEATTLE 🙏🏼
100% I like all your songs. Favorite one (system) facts. Riot.🔥🔥  Fan in the pacific🌊🤙
Holy crap that was hard!  The sound engineering / music production on this sounds incredible... the guitar's huge!
for the love of what is good, please do not fall for tims pool tricks, he will beg and lie and even promote you to get you under his wing. dont do it.
Nice work, Tom. I'm diggin' that pile of skulls and bones. 👍
Lets start a riot
I normally love Tom McDonald’s songs. But I’m not gonna lie, this one is a little flat and lacking depth. Still love ur stuff though

I love this song the more I listen the more I love it. Lets start a Riot!!
Good job Tom, spread the facts ignore the lies, nice to see light in a dark time🤘🇺🇸
Damn bro. You’re murdering the game.
something I can share with my 14 year old daughter ... and I'm I the only person who recently felt the need to break out my Nevermind the Bullocks album recently?  idk man I respect life of coarse but it's insane what the world will become so  glued too.. refreshing to have something to view that's not caught up in the collective Ideology that's swept the internet recently. And BE LOUDER THEN THE NOISE OF the noisy
I wouldn’t mind playing guitar for Tom on his next tour
Legit palm mutes
What does your neighbors think when you are shooting music videos????????
Your energy is insane! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Same same same old shit
I’ve played this on Repeat and the vibe gives me so much energy! Keep it coming brother ! I can’t wait for the next on!

Dude you are a freakin badass! Keep going.
Tom and Nova Ilove this ty for spiting out the crazy truth !!!!❤️🙏❤️✌️🪶🦅🎶🎶🎶

I always think a song can't be as good as the last and you blow my mind Every. Single. Time

Amazing work Tom man its literally mind blowing how it just keeps getting better.
Tom what I truly love about you is not only Mom and Dad's love you but Grandma and Granpa and the kids are listening as well and you are blessed and so am I just to able to get to hear you and I love Nova as well and this video is farout groovy and outasight man can ya dig it daddy-o, yes I'm a 70 yr.man but I'm hip.
Cuz, you continue to astound. Love you, brudda.  I been around, I been cracked, people thinking I'm whack, wanna make fat stacks off me, when all I wanna do relax, make 'em understand that I'm just a man, a dad...does that make me bad, but when you disrespect it makes makes mad, cuz I'm just tryna be real, to understand how we might be real, keep it real, how we can cope without all the dope and the bullshits of peeps telling us to be legit, putting words in our voices, given no choices...like we stuffed toys and...all we wanna do is make noises..for the people who have choices...   ...and they choose us.  I know...it's shit, but I dig you, Bruh. Thank you for being you.
🔥 🔥
You’re not white pac in the flesh. You are Tom MacDonald. You are relevant and alive. Stay true and never waver. HOG 4ever🤟
Not my favorite of yours bro, but it wasn't bad. Still love you and Nova and wish you prosperity, safety, happiness and fulfillment in your careers and your general lives. :)
Amazing!!!!! Pro Life, Pro American, Pro 2A
Holy shit….. Tim pool reacted to your stuff …. On Timcast
like- people!!!!
Tom is a Savage and at the top of his game and Nova is at a minimum she is equal! They are only competing with themselves at this point! #HOG
Let’s start a riot! #HOG
Love that utterly deserved self satisfied look on Tom's face at the very end. Perfect, bro👍🤟🔥
Youtube dosnt notify me hardly anymore . Never knew Tom dropped a new video until now when i went to his channel .

Timcast fan here. Definitely adding your music to my YT Music playlist. Thanks for doing your part in the culture jam!
Thanks Tom. X
Ayo props to Nova and Co, too 🤘
Whoa, Tom, this one is a banger! Love the song which I bought, of course, and added to my Spotify list. I'm proud to support you. The video was excellent, Nova...Fantastic effects!!!
Number 1 so good bless up brother:)
Love it !!
Name dropping Rock don't count? Since when dude? Please.
Where can I find the charts? I keep getting the Brave. Frustrated! It better be #1 on the charts!

🤤
🙌
I like how people act like this dude's a positive influence, and he talks about how other people just talk about money, then he goes on and talks about having money, then goes on a relatively crappy shouting spree about how he has fans and other people don't, while not saying anything worthwhile or positive.  And the dude is anti-gun. What kinda moronic ass shit...
1:23-1:26 that break down is the BEST part of the song.
Dope
These people that wait are so funny but we love them to HOG
These got to be bots ain’t no way someone’s grand parent in their 60s listening to this trash.   Yb better
Wtf this is amazing
👉🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The one-eyed symbolism is too much in this video. Did you sellout bro?
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
hardcore hip-hop i love it
Lets start a Riot bro!!!
This slaps so hard - you never cease to impress me. This is def a BANGER!
Love Tom but this isn’t it for me. We all have different tastes… but I support him 100%.  Waiting for the next one to drop! 👍🏼👍🏼
Dope visuals!
Tim Pool shouted out Tom and the song. Know you made it when you getting shoutout from one of the large podcasts

Ok I am old as dirt. I am not a fan of rap. But I have to admit this. This video is brilliant. The cinematography in this video is first class the best I have seen in decade. I got grandkids and great grand kids and this is the first time in decades I actually sat still and watched and listened to a rap video.  Do not hate on me I am your gramma; but I am an artist as well. So congradulation to Tom MacDonald you are a genius.
Yooooooo! This is so sick(kkk)
I get Road Warrior vibes from this guys coat, anyone else?
COMMENTS TRAAAAAAIN! LETS KEEP IT ROLLING!
God damn bro you're killing it every song keep up the good work man!
This was one of the best!
My guy, I'm honestly relieved after that this came out, I've been worried after about you. God speed

Tom , your lyrical artistry and Novas video insight & incredible imagination  add to what sets you two apart from the mainstream.  Love all your hard work and the music & videos you reward us with.
fantastic video 💗💗💗👍
Algorithm 👍🏼
Hangover Gang!!!
THANK YOU TOM! Another great one!! Many days.. YOUR.. tunes.. help… megetthrough my work day!!
Best song ive heard in a few months  And its also something ive noticed Alot of scammers posing as fake toms in the feed.
Riot boys  And not dumb enough To fall for scammers in the feed.
Can’t believe this guy is still alive!!!  I bow my head to you sir!
Nope
Well done, good sir.
🎤 👇 damn it son!!
I just found you because Tim Poole just gave you a shout out. I'm glad I did.
Those audios and videography . Moving up.
Awesome video!!! Why you so quiet ?
Keep kickin it. it was another  between the goal posts
Tom needs to have electric guitars 🎸 in his songs more often
Wow were are getting tecky now with the special effects.
His music should be on the trending list. But of course YouTube only puts videos on the trending list to push there agendas on there, not cos it's actually trending.
😎🤙🕉
All our family love your music... fantastic! Thanks 👍 from Tasmania
My favorite songs are the ones where the guy with black eyes shows up.
I  have much respect for you.
When we gonna get a Tom MacDonald and TechN9ne song?…
Love all your music. Keep it coming. Keep pushing forward. Head up my friend
Could you imagine Tom McDonald, NF, Hopsin, Dax, and Token on a track 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
- $- New Music - Keith Ona Mission - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n56AKaFFkiU
Any time you wanna hear me scream in agony, play rap music! However, I have expanded my horizons.., you have taught me to listen to the message and ignore all the noise. I've also learned you need to sometimes endure the noise, to actually hear the message... I don't have to like rap music to appreciate you, as a person. My wish for you, you need Billions of fans! You make people think.., that's a good thing. 👍
What can I say here, your fantastic great well spoken barely come across you in last two months heard so many songs have some favs the system stupid people keep up unique sounds and I'll keep you bumping loud on JBL speaker thanks much respect!!!!
Keep on keeping it real brother we love it👍👍👍
How can you love rap and don't appreciate this man talent ???
Damn!!! You always suprise me!
Tom I was missing you ^_^♡ And then you you hit me up with this one 👏 come do a show in Vancouver plz 🙏 I so want to hear this song live
Brilliant!!!!✊🏻🔥🔥🔥
Tom I'm not hateful and I love you and over both but this has made me feel that you have become more mainstream than anything else and there's only certain cues and maybe you did it on purpose but when you shorten your voice like that makes you sound like any other one that's going to use that attitude okay so stop that's one number two I feeling myself when I saw you were a speaker for the people my soul spoke for you and I followed you and I liked you and I bet you up for everything I even supported Nova I liked her earlier music for like back in those days like but will you just laid out for me made me feel like you just want mainstream it makes me scared please
I love Tom so much, so much talent and he speaks facts
Lets start a Riot!!!
Hey Tom,  PLEASE go onTimcast IRL as a guest. Would be a great interview.  🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏

With the upside down cross on your mask, I think it is time to go see what Adam Calhoun is up too.
#9 is total BS.  This is a #1 if I ever heard one.
Brother I've bought 5 cds and shirts for your store. I love your work. But after watching this video for the 5th time I caught the upside down cross on your face mask. Makes one wonder who you are for? This is a season of deception for sure. 😑
Yes Thomas ❣️  Two Million ‼️‼️💯  H.O.G. Fam forever 🤗❣️🤗

By the way, I love that smirk at the end. It reminds me of "No Response" 😂

Let’s start a riot!!
I looove the line “I do big things, risk bling, you don’t want this action” because we know you spend your money on making more music and I can very much relate considering I risked ten years of saving money doing construction to buy land and build a ranch/farm/homestead and for the last three years I have lived on a budget of $2500 a year and spent all my remaining money on buying more animals and buying seed to grow food for those animals. I definitely live what most would consider to be a boring and hard working life, but the fulfillment I get from it is something I never could have imagined being possible. Not to mention in the next five to ten years I will have an annual income three times the amount I was making working a dead end construction job with potential to even double that further down the road. Keep doing your thing! We’re loving it! Great relatable music!
Tom out here changing the game
Fun fact: that mound of bones is made up of a wooden box that Tom built that is surrounded with cinder blocks and those cinderblocks are filled with waterproof paper and covered with canned spray insulation foam. Then Tom spray painted that mound of foam over the cinderblocks with black spray paint and that was covered with topsoil which surprisingly was mostly manure lol 😂. Then over top of that they placed animal and human bones that they had purchased and were stained by Tom’s sister to look real. Tom’s friend did the CGI effects. Tom was just on the side of his patio there in front of a 20 foot green screen that he built and painted then his brother-in-law added the special effects!! Is this not the absolute best team of people you could ever think of???
You are my favorite Tom! Thank you.
God I LOVE YOU TOM MCDONALD.... U SCREAM WHAT ITS ABOUT. UR HARD N HEAVY THEN U GO AND GET TOTALLY EMOTIONAL AND I CANT GET ENOUGH OF YOU!!! KEEP IT COMING!!! 😜😘🥰🤩
I need the sound bite from Talladega nights where he says, I don't know what it is but I love it 🤪
🔥🤘🤪🤘🔥🇬🇧
wow    Tom MacDonald -Baaazz]  yes
i was waiting for the drop the whole song, that guitar riff that would blow my soul away. I never got it, and im not angry at all. I just cant help but bounce.
Comment
Bro love you and love the song. I think you should do a metal rap song. You got the voice man. I think it would be intense.
Lets start a Riot!!!
🤟🔥
Admonish
🔥LET'S START A RIOT🔥 🔥LET'S START A RIOT🔥
I'll leave you six feet under that's a underground rapper
Freaking amazing your a beast thank you for every thing you helped me through .
First biden got the thumbs down removed.  This guy's gonna get the trending removed.
I hope you get 2 million views on yt!  💜❤🧡💘💟💜💞

Had this on repeat, such a vibe 🔥
Just a quick comment to help with the algorithm
dope video
🔥🔥🔥
Who else is here from Timcast IRL ?
Need to start having your chores go way harder pop & should of added another minute to this banger.
Look Tom you aren’t talented at all, what you did with bad guy sampling bad bunny. Every song just sounds the same with the same melody, I’m not trying to hate but try to change your style more. You should of left dear slim as an instrumental bonus track. Work smarter, not harder.
One day I will have a small amount of what you have(different content) but one day I'll have a fraction and will feel the same passion.
this is pretty dope
Eh...
You know how you listen to a song and think. Not bad.  Then you listen to it again And again  And again  And again  All of a sudden you realize it hooked ya
Listened on repeat for hours
🔥🔥🔥Let's Start A RIOT!🔥🔥🔥 #itunes #amazon

So cool love the flying bones around.
I DONT LIKE RAP BUT MY GOODNESS I BLOODY LOVE THIS !!! FXXKING AMAZING TUNE. BOOOOOM
Shared liked and fucking love you for exposing the radical left and wokism and the lefts agenda to spew evil #letsnotrisetotherebs
Only thing I liked about this song was the guitar 🎸
Got the song on iTunes! Hopes for any (or all 😂) your songs being pressed to vinyl? Would love to pick up multiple albums and songs on analog
Hi Tom, I’m 60 years old, from downtown Toronto, I always loved old school rap and I’m a record collector, the last time I was blown away from that genre was Daily Bread by Apollo Brown with Hassan Mackey and was pretty much done with rap after that then you showed up on my phone… what an incredible talent and blessing you are, loved your story telling too so articulate and intelligent, you are hilarious and powerful and I believe that you will continue to amaze people… sending you love and blessings….
🔥🔥🔥Let's Start A RIOT!🔥🔥🔥 #itunes #amazon
Meh..
Damn that guitar is a nice touch. Great song, Tom!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Intense as fuck! You're getting better and better!
This is a banger for years tooo come! Bravo my Man🤯
My kids love 💕 your songs and message !! I can’t ask for anything more when it comes to them being able to speak the facts and not worry about peoples feelings !! Being INDEPENDENT is a rare trait and still standing strong even when it’s just you and your other half !! Keep up the good work ! Making Kids Free thinkers again #MakinKidsFreeThinkAgain
Please stop putting your cringe adds in facebook you stupid insult in the name of art
I'm OBSESSED 💯👑🫶🩸🩸🩸
I sent my mom the links to The System  and Brainwashed…she’s a writer….she said, “wow, that’s incredibly well written”…..she’s 68. Don’t ever sell your soul to the mainstream puppeteers. Stay YOU.
Yes sir!!
🔥🔥🔥Let's Start A RIOT!🔥🔥🔥 #itunes #amazon
Videography only going up, dangggg
My Grandma listens Tom 😤👍🏻
Video reminded me of Rap God a little bit. Just in that part where Em's in the middle of the tornado of stuff.  Still awesome shit.
Badass Jam 👏
Start a riot !!! Keep on making us think Tom , you and Nova can change the world. Mad props love your music
YouTube is censoring this song makes me mad
🔥🔥🔥Let's Start A RIOT!🔥🔥🔥 #itunes #amazon
anyways keep up the work and content I might buy merchandise if u have any
hey Tom I been watching ur videos since wannabe I only recently subscribed after whiteboy man this guy Lil byte dissed u said ur a copy cat to em even though he's using eminems name and voice to get views how ironic
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥RIOT!!!!!!!
Do you think this guy sings the entire song in every shot and cut them together or only record the part that gets put in the video
Love riot
Trump's should use it as his new rally opening track. 😅
Good song
Won't lie, when this showed up, I was ready to skip, but the beat and lyrics had me hooked. Great job :D
Can't stop listening to this!!!! Amazing.
Hell yeah! I love it Tom. Big fan here! Been a fan since 2020. You never disappoint! I love you and Nova. Downloaded.
Ahhh love it! Tom’s XP bar keeps filling up, buddy hitting new levels every drop! Keep doing you player  ;) HOG
🔥🔥🔥Let's Start A RIOT!🔥🔥🔥 #itunes #amazon
man Tom this so deep and dark i love this new style of music. you hit this song hard AF Tom🔥🔥
More heavy guitar! There I've said it.
9:47
Why are you wearing the ski mask with the upside down cross on it? That scares me... Like that gives me pause. I love your music and I have been a fan but I just can't make that add up
This is the dopest track I have ever heard in the last 20 years my hats off to you Tom you are the G.O.A.T !!!!
🔥🔥🔥Let's Start A RIOT!🔥🔥🔥 #itunes #amazon
Meh.  I enjoy a good bit of Tom's music, but the ones which are just masturbating the ego are usually a miss in my playlist.  Best of luck.  No hate.
Yoooo, Tom, this is SO fire, the metal guitar in this is so effin tasty
Sooo lol the only ppl I know that sing about the illuminati are in it..just saying...btw what's up with all the devil aka luciferian symbolism in your videos..
Love you dog but the auto tune and the underground don't go, or does it. Wtf do i know, I grew up to Bad Dreams and LMNO
♥️♥️🤍🤍💙💙
The crickets part went well with the lyrics. I like beat and wordplay combos. Nora is getting pro vids.
Trump's theme for rallies.
Let’s start a riot!!!!
Let's get Tom to #1 on billboard.
Loved more rock riffs  Keep it coming 🔥

Tuesday's riot!

Bam! 🎯 Because, as Cus D'Amato once said, most men are cowards.  Silent cowards = sheep.  Apathy, greed, and silence is what the machine is pressuring all in this nation to get wrapped up in.  Love your HATERZ!  They are only there because you SPEAK TRUTH!
mid
Almost 2 million views since Friday when it dropped that's crazy I don't know if I've ever seen a video get that many views in such short amount of time however I could be wrong
You know how all them rappers keep telling you that they made it from the gutter 90% of them didn't make it from the gutter they were set on a pedestal gave a script and they acted it out kind of like people like Ice Cube fake as hell phony as hell and jealous as hell at people like Tom McDonald. Go white boy go white boy go fuck em all. Lol
Playing 4days straight...    This one person has played it in 3 states..   let's see how many sticker get placed on my JBL.   Each sticker is a state.   Happy Birthday month Tom MacD ❣️

u r amazing but please I would love to follow the real u on Twitter I thought I had the real u until they came out with oh u r 1 of 5 people to get a secret gift from me. then I said what I told them and they cused me ha life is what it is. but im glad I got 1 real account that's urs
Nova is killing it with these videos!!!
Make a song Bout how we r the last Americans that will exist. Technically this nation has already collapsed and the masses has no clue war has been declared on them. I walk around and see so many that doesn't even have a clue what's happening,ya know what that means. Operation mockingbird was a success. Since we the people failed to fulfill our constitutional duties, we will all be dead by 2030. Why do u think Klaus swab announced they will be speeding up agenda 2030. They now know after these series of test we have been going through for the past years , but now they know they can ramp up the war even harder and we won't lift a finger to stop them. Look at all we have already allowed..... Better tell ur fans that Jesus will be back soon cause this spiritual war is almost over.
Love the independent artist movement. Keep pushing back on the industry
Soo in love with your music all 😀💖💖💖💖💖
How am I 3 days late??
Video makes me think of what's coming . Passion in the video is response. So relevant to what's happening and going to happen.

I’m fuckin w it but I’m not going to front  NEEKS is even better https://youtu.be/pbgMPWd-2-I
In my opinion your videos and music is better than most videos that come from people with big people backing them they just don't have your vision or your heart. GOD bless
Let’s start a riot!! So excited!  System~>👺💥💪🏼😎<~Tom
🔥🔥🔥
Crushing it big bruh!
Well-done Tom 👌
🔥🔥🔥Let's Start A RIOT!🔥🔥🔥 #itunes #amazon
are we ever getting back to the real rap? 3 or more songs in a row about how great you are is doing the exact thing that you talk trash about. you say another bracket than the others but it's the same thing... please get back to the music and stop making tracks cause another rapper says something about you. the bigger man wouldn't even hear it. he would be looking up too high.
Please help bring our leaders together we need to do so much more and I'm not intelligent enough to know what that is but I appeal to you to use your following to find people that are intelligent enough to start a movement to start changing our entire political system Republican and Democrat I know it'll be hard you'll probably lose a lot if you step into the ring we need people like you
Formula. Tired. Oh yes.
Amazing
not my kind of song, But Nova & Jared did a grate job on this video
🔥🔥🔥Let's Start A RIOT!🔥🔥🔥 #itunes #amazon
Excellent
Hey Tom and Nova we are gonna need the super spiked jacket to be sold
Amazing song and video
Just to let you know that I am a 58 year old black man from Barbados and you have totally restored my faith in the power of music to confront the real issues facing people today. Respect to you brother 🙏
Hey Tom, can you believe that my 11 month old daughter loves riot? If she's crying I put it on and she immediately stops and starts dancing!   You are amazing and love this new sound!
Keep on BREAKING THROUGH All of this Deeply Sexualized/Population Reducing (No Children and Yes STDs), Racialized/Stuck in a seemingly Unforgiving Past, Deflective, DECEPTIVE, and Most of all FOOLISH AND GASLIGHTING CULTURE TOM God is using you to Show the True Realization of our Inherent Sinful Nature in one of the most Propagateing outlets of all, Rap and Hip Hop!
Nova killed this video
Tom's videos always deliver... excellent imagery with the dystopian theme.  Would love to have a song dealing with some of the issues today like homeless vets or fentanyl issues.  Keep them coming'!!!
1M 🔥! Still killing it bro!!
🔥🔥🔥Let's Start A RIOT!🔥🔥🔥 #itunes #amazon
Killed it!!!!
Tom, the country loves you. 🇺🇸
Yeah I listened again, I still can't get in to this song; definitely not his best work, I don't mind him being somewhat prideful because he has done a huge accomplishment, but dedicating an entire song to it is kind of meh.  I like his other rap a lot more.
LET'S START A RIOT

Golden! Keep dropping those banger and ima keep showing up!
"Thomas" makes so much sense, you're a twin. Check out Jonathan Kleck to understand much of the trap you were born into.
Great video Tom!
Everything you drop is FIRE and will continue to grow my dude!! Grant said so! Love yall Tom!
awesome 👍
😃😃😃
🤩🤩🤩

This flow crazy 🤩 Amazing song, keep going, stay blessed 🙏❤

„Let’s start a riot“ is a sentence you probably can be jailed for in my country nowadays. And now I’m not living in Kim Jong-un land… I’m German… I’m not sure if what I just said could not be considered as hate speech too!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
FN A 👍👍🔥
No "Industry" needed. American dream right here. We have the power to make anything of ourselves that the universe will allow! Just need will, and the love of a few good people. Bless you Tom! May your journey be a long and joyous one.
Lets start a Riot!!!
Tom if you are so independent? Tell me the difference between mainstream artist and an independent artist... You're independent right?  So you are capable of answering this question right?  If you can't answer my question I'm just gonna assume there is no such thing as an independent artist  Who do you answer too?
#LetStartARiot 🖤🤍🤟
Shared. And grateful that u are standing up and speaking truth
Hahahaha everyone’s wanting to know the diss is too!!! That shows there’s too many fucking fakes…. 🔥🤘🏼🥃🇺🇸🫡💪🏼🏴
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🏴🫡💪🏼 That metal riff… 🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼🥃🔥
🤘🏼💀🇺🇲
A true artist!🤘 Not only is your music amazing but your videos are next level 🔥 Independent and made with real Passion. Shout out to the hog Australia loves use all
I want Tom and Yelawolf to do a collab song or a rap battle. It would be epic. 😭
Like it Tom. I get into your music. But sometimes I just wish you could rap a uplifting song to play in my ride. I know it’s easy to get down. But enjoying life still has to happen. Write us a cool song even if it’s about the past happy times. When we were free. Free to be me. Not a cheap false narrative. But able to not PC hurt the snow ❄️ flakes. Cause they didn’t get all bent out of shape over words.
I'm this, I'm that..... becoming lame brah 😪
🌬
Honestly not my fav but still good
FACTS Again and Again....And again Tom MacDonald is in  THE SAYING IT LIKE IS Hall of Truth !
It's messing with my head, that is your back yard & a pile of 💩 😂 Nova smashed it out of the park for this one!
Why the upside down cross on your mask at 24 seconds?
The algorithm is trying to suppress Tom bro. I never got a recommendation that this went trending on #2.
Bro….THIS BEAT IS INSANE!!!! This $hit hits hard, and exactly why we gotta protect TOM MCDONALD by all costs bc they will come after him and wanna cancel him. Can’t let that happen just bc liberals don’t the truth and Tom spits the truth! Another Banger and another plaque Tom can hang on the wall! 😂. ✌️
Is this the new A.I. rapper ? That people are going on about
Tim Pool Sent me. Even though I already own a ton of your stuff already.
Bruh, You’re genius. Keep up the good work brother. 🥰
Another great song from a true patriot that is a artist... Keep up the good work Tom. My best regards from Canada 🇨🇦
Short, snappy, to the point, catchy and with a great video. Getting T2 vibes from it lol, but in a good way. It would be funny to see someone splice the video of this with some Terminato 2 footage kind of like Guns N Roses did the You Could Be Mine single, I'd do it myself but that requires tech skills and editing skills lol. In time maybe I'll learn.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Y'all did it again!!!  This one gets a Big Fk Yeaaaaaah...
I hate rap. But I love talent. What is talent?. I think you are buddy
What happens when our underground becomes mainstream?  I'm old enough to see it happen more than once. RHCP, Run D-mc, Beastie Boys, etc. Awesome  Stay true  Be the next innovator

These comments are funny people trying to figure out who Tom is talking about.  I think it's Token.  But as always I'm probably wrong
Is this a reply to Topher's song called dear Tom??? It kinda sounds like it is in a way without saying his name😉😉 love the song🔥🔥 always good!! I've watched/listened to it about 50 times now❤️❤️ H.O.G 4 life❤️❤️
That jacket 😍
Um, alright this was fire... Now I'm wondering who pissed Tom off to receive this fire. Another Mac Lethal, what?
Love it!  I would have liked to the the red eyes but I understand you wanna every hater to see your true eyes just think the red would add the don’t mess with me. Love the mad max jacket !  Great job!
its a slapper!!
That beat, this video, those lyrics. Dude, you've got a seriously killer tune here. I think you'd be so great at the whole metal rap type genre. RaTM type shit. This is FIRE and I might be outta the loop or maybe it hasn't been said aloud but I wonder who pissed you off?!  This hits different tho. A  product of maturation/mastery and that's exciting! Can't wait for the new album to drop!! All the recent shit I've heard from Tom is 🔥
💯
🙏
🙏
This is how you own the haters!!!
dear tom macdonald. before i started listening to you, i had nothing. i was a cringe liberal sheep with no money no cars no girlfriend. now i have a wife and 2 children, one of whom is starting their freshman year in college now. thank you for opening my eyes.
i dont know how i hate him and love him 🙃
Badass song! So well put it shut my secret societal neural link the fuck up. Thanks for the peace
Metal feel 😮 ❤
"Til I'm dead I swear to God I'll do it my way, grinded all my life now everyday is Friday" aka the day no one drops any music but Tom because it's his day. That bar links up with one from a previous song perfectly 🔥
Let's start a riot 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Not my particular taste but could see a ufc fighter coming out to this and having a good time. Well done sir

I’m new to finding out about Tom McDonald. Damn, I’ve been missing out on this wayyy too long. I love this dude for speaking up about what most Americans are thinking but either scared or have no voice. So thank you Mr. McDonald for risking your neck and speaking up for us!! Love you bro
The metal feel this has is great

@eminem @eminemmusic you need to support your #stan he is amazing, maybe I will soften my heart to give you another chance to fuk me over again 😏then again maybe not I'm practically a virgin 7 years not even a kiss 💋 from a guy I'm drop evidence in your inbox if you support your #stan 🥵🥵🥵 then I want apologizes 🥵 and never accuse me of shit again 4r, just cuz I'm going to a hard time don't make me a hoe you made me have to be a hoe because you say I don't have an ass you say that I'm a slut so should I show the shit that's almost closed to the world? 😁😂Only 3 have seen I can make you reap what you have sewn🥵🥵🥵💯 but I will give you a free pass if you do the right thing white boy deserves your support 💯🤞 scouts Honor ❤️‍🔥
Who hasn't Tom "attacked"; putting a mirror to a face?  There are some categories left--- get on it, Tom!  His self-deprecation is so endearing, he sees his flaws, points them out, and says, "Hey, Hang Over Gang, let's do better!"
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 OK! Thank You! Tom I'm glad u did this I really miss ya! Keep it up"

The song and the video are dope. I appreciate that you are using your platform to inspire people to stay independent. They want us to sell out and buy in to following their propaganda.  Keep up the fight! Stay strong! I thank You and  Nova for your music and videos.
Very disappointed.  My boy didn't put enough spikes on his jacket and not enough background sparks.
When will I ever get to see Tom live???
I have a total heart-on right now! 🤤
Sounds awesome!
Freaking awesome as always..   Love the metal sound,, video is off the hook.  Amazing how every video pushes your capabilities to the next level.   As usual, Nova and you both hit it out of the ball park..
cool video... one of your weakest songs to date though... I hate to say that cause I'm a big fan of yours overall, but gotta say what I think
Don’t really love this on but hey ! We cant love every song ! Btw continue your work !
God work .08 second soundbite
The reason I thumb down this is because your bars are not as well as they were in this house I love that song
Holy cow this is great!
That heavy metal rip is dope!

This song is fire 🔥 and I needed to hear it more than ever just personally a lot going on that has me discouraged. I’m sure there’s more greatness coming much ❤️ to you and Nova !!!
im watching again right meow
Your delivery reminds me of a band I used to listen to in the 80s/90s called Minor Threat. Though they were hard-core punk, they vocalized their opinions about society in a loud way with a dash of aggressive.  You are original and my comparison is a compliment.
Please put your music on platforms like band camp I want to support you but I don't give money to amazon and apple
The BEST song yet!!! You knocked it outta the park…AGAIN ❤️❤️❤️
damn. insane u guys jus UP the level. went to a flee market with my son jus chillin... till we heard, "Hangover Gang!" ... From somebody browsing like us...man that feels so good. Much Love.

hello to those who read this, I take 1 minute of your time to tell you that Jesus loves you with all his heart and that he calls you to follow him, because he loves you so intensely that he is put on the cross to wash away your sins because he loves you more than anyone in this world and Jesus Christ has a plan for you and know that he is coming soon and this world of depravity is over the point of disappearing ✝️

🔥🔥Let's Start A RIOT!🔥🔥 #itunes #amazon
Very good song I don’t like the chorus it’s kinda generic for u
Damn Tom did it again fool
If people think your not versatile then they should listen to your earlier stuff with Nova has GFBF following you on Spotify and those songs are dope especially Phone calls it's a brilliant track even then your lyrical artistry was on another level and Nova wow your voice is incredible Tom your more than a rapper those songs prove that  #Hangovergang
Badass song badass video
Nice and I think the video is prophetic.
Tom…. I first listened to this in my truck and was like damn I wish it had more guitar and low bass…. But then I listened 67 more times on my Bose and determined it is absolutely flawless!!!
I wish you the best and thank you so much for such awesome music
And can we just take a moment to love the hell outta the video!!!!! Bad ass!!!
Who pissed Tom off is what I wanna know!!!
🔥🔥Let's Start A RIOT!🔥🔥 #itunes #amazon
I really loved “Names”
Tom keep doing you brother. Fuck the bullshit that's going on wish more people would actually listen to wtf you say
DUDE! 👍👍👍
Fucking banger....let that metal confuse them.
I've liked Tom macdonald for a long time now but it's all starting to sound the same to me. We need another track like "I'm Sorry". Just hard af
People wanna talk till they blue in the face until that shit hits back now look at em
I am always impressed with how great your videos are! Big shout out to Nova for her skills. You two make an amazing team and its certainly fate… you have both been given a purpose to be the momentum this world needs for positive change, at such a crucial moment. I love this family we have. HANGOVER GANG FOREVER!!
I am 56 I love you!  Thank you!

K 😎🕷🦁
Bro u never seem to amaze me with your music with your attitude with your whole outlook on life man,I have seen ages 10 to 60 love your music in my life my daughter my dad my sister all found you independently of one another and we all love it    Keep up the good work and f$** those who say a damn thing negative
Hey tom you if you're truly the  artist you say  you are with that being said I issues that we got you one,  Adam mabe listen to 30 sec of my track and told me it was basically shit in a nice way to I'm in a situation where a person with mental health issues is going through cuz they're getting real big on it okay I'm trying to help people what we live through to my words and when I talk to Adam I was just starting out my third deal is that you're not doing it for yourself or doing it for the fans they're the ones that are paying us and my fourth issue is nice if you get help to come someone come together and help me with the double turntable mixer and and iPad for my music and I can do shows and I also would like to give you the honor to pick one of my tracks for my first album you know the people choosing my first album what they want to come out on it so if that's too hard or have someone in your office get back to me it would be great I could either be for each day 707-362-4304 or at my Gmail heshnook@gmail.com
Well lookie here, YouTube decided not to tell me this dropped on Friday and I’m still subscribed…..🤔
Hell yeah
They won't let me thumb it up twice.much love.
Love it 🎉
Great song Tom! Love to see more songs about life, real struggles, real accomplishments. All the things the ones in power want to take away. Etc etc. That's where you're stuff is pure gold in my opinion.
🔥🔥Let's Start A RIOT!🔥🔥 #itunes #amazon
Spotify would be great
Another dope ass Tom Macdonald drop!!!!! If it's up if it's up if it's up bring it down lol!!!!!!!!!! Love it brother!
Get”uhMmmm
I grew luvin hip-hop until it had nothing left to say but nonsense.    It's obvious true artists such as this young man are attacked for luvin their country!  We got u fam!
I LOVE that Tom gets more views that Eminem, where is slim shady these days??? oh yeah he’s a woke loser sellout that no one cares to listen to….
I've done it all! Waiting to see #1 by the video!!! HOG for life!!
Yooo Tom, I like the guitar in the background, you should do more of this, maybe even a rock / rap track. Either way you are killing it, the establishment can’t handle the fact you broke through and millions of people love what you are doing.  PS: please more songs with Nova and Mad Child.
Love it!! Keep dropping them 🔥
Maaaaan I can't get enough of this one! I just keep coming back! Is it me or does it seem to short! Like I got this on constant repeat! Love u Tom! Nova, these visuals fukkin KILL IT! ONE HELL OF A VIDEO! U two are the MOST TALENTED COUPLE I've seen in a long time! Keep it up! #HOG! KILLED IT WITH ANOTHER ONE!
A+
Donald MacDonald.
The diss to Asa was weak, my man will blast ur ass with some crazy bars
So you finally responded to Asa ?
You will always make good music keep it up
Tom I want your help please keep up with good music
You been liftin?
Man I've been steady hitting every person reacting to this song for the last 3 day's most are new people that have never heard Tom's music 💯 There is no way this isn't over 2mil by now and headed towards 3💣🔥
Everywhere I go it's a riot :)
Let's Start a Riot..🔥🔥
It's Riot time
normalde hiç tarzım değildir ama mix beni düşürdü,gitarsa tam bir kaos.

Lets start a Riot bro!! Lets bring the heat 🔥
🤘😎🤘💥🇺🇸💥🤘😎🤘
OUTSTANDING, AGAIN!!!
The crickets at the end had a clean finish brotha, keep on keeping on till ya can't.
Tom is the best!
His jacket looks like it does rolling damage
Waving in from Communist Canada.... Just wanted to say Tom, I was never into rap much I am old school metal rocker... But when I came across your videos COUPLE YEARS AGO  Ya got me hooked, My self being at 3 years into heavy PROTESTING the system . I better say most of my life but the last 3 yrs I has been going hard at it hitting the streets of Ottawa... Your music is AMAZING. You make it feel like your taking the words straight out of my head.... Most people are afraid to say out loud what you sing.PS I speak the truth like you every day to people. I don't give a fk when people even in my family don't like what I have to say, Some people Cant handle the TRUTH. FKN SHEEP ... I applaud you Sir Tom McDonald ... Keep pumping out the TRUTH  brother. Just for the record you are the ONLY RAPPER I listen too..
Keep going, Tom. Don't back off of the mainstream clowns.
Love the heavy guitar. Need more of it in your songs for sure!
Banger, but why the fuck is it censored?
Awesome
I'm 62 years young, Never got the Rap thing at all ,tried it but didn't stimulate me ,UNTILL YOU !!    One of my workers was listening to you (  no radios on my site ,  I banned that shit ) so they listen to their own stuff , Sometimes I force them to listen to the Floyd or Gary Moore , You words ,style and delivery resonated within me ,summed this shitty world up , Will definitely be checking your stuff out again , Great stuff ,  Did I give that lad a rise !!   Maybe  !
Thank you tom macdonald,  I fucking love all your music
🔥🔥Let's Start A RIOT!🔥🔥 #itunes #amazon
Good song!!
I can see in the future. 1 day we will meet.
Really like the metal touch and the bass. Perfect!
just wanted to toss this at you. Can you sing the The Star-Spangled Banner... no fluff no BS just straight I think you would do it justice and prolly got the heart to actually convey the emotion.......but the fuck I know... live long and stay safe
I legit was just looking at that exact same spiked leather jacket not even five days ago!!! 😂 this is awesome by the way
So proud but I do have to say I can’t hear a Cricket anymore without thinking about this song. Complete 🔥
Mark my words, "always gotta name-drop" will become the "no capes!" of rap music.
😱😍😍🥰🥰😍🥰🥰😍Hi
As per usual " outstanding" Tom's got a team that's free
Another HIT that kicks the dems ass.
Shared and Downloaded, LOVE IT. ❤️
Me too brother
Tom and Nova are both seriously incredible! WELL DONE!!!!! LOVE IT!!!
#HangoverGangForever🔥⭐️🤘🏆

dope
The visuals and music on this one is so fucking good. I can't relate to the lyrics as much. But man I love the music on this one.
🔥🔥Let's Start A RIOT!🔥🔥 #itunes #amazon
Not your best but still far better than mainstream propaganda.  Thenks
didnt like it
Goosebumps 👌
I love the revelations like reference
I feel like this was the music industry song but much harder and honest then ever Tom! Keep up the great song drops I love your work and as a streamer I am making a difference there as well you are in music my guy. Love your work thank you for this drop! I love this.
hire security tommy buns. love what ur doin
Let's start a riot
Let's start a riot!
Just gotta... Trump rally: I show up and it's a riot, they excited.  Biden rally: Where you go ain't nothing like it. Why so quiet?
You keep rising they wanna fly it. Denying you already passed it. In my eyes you passed Eminem a long time ago. You more than proved yourself as a huge fan I'm proud of you
Dose he get anything if I download it here?
This song makes me think of a Trump rally vs. a Biden " gathering"
🔥🔥Let's Start A RIOT!🔥🔥 #itunes #amazon
Awesome! Get some #1!
LoL you go boy.my mom bought the song to help you make#1 I would but I don't have money..ever.
that's I wanted to say I'm proud of you bro love the stuff that you put out then the rest of the common follows
hey Tom I also want to sound proud bro some of the stuff that you put out matter of fact all the stuff that you've been putting out is much better than the garbage out today especially like the stuff that you talk about what's going on with America that's some real s*** bro that people need to listen to
Not liking this. Just as bad as listen to no point. Guess this was more on a point then your song.  Truth spoken!
Hi Tom great video , but YouTube keep unsubscribing me from your channel.
Spitting in the eye of the industry. I bought this song on Amazon before I came here to listen to it for the first time. Consider me a dragon on your shoulder in this spiritual war. We will take this planet back for humanity.
The music industry as well as Hollywood is a psyop. Tom knows this and is the antithesis of their narrative. Keep blowing the lid off brother!
LETS START A RIOT!!
I've been bashed,scarredNAKED.....I'm petrified.why so quiet.lokt .loaded dude...black ribbon day????
🔥
LETS START A RIOT!!
You always smash it.. keep it up men nerve get tied listening to your music💪💪💪
Hell ya!!  🔥 fire!!!
1.044.000 Followers on Spotify I been following since 175.000. Hooh shii Tom keep going homie. Big time love bro
Your a legend love it when you team up with other legends like Adam
Help the Algo
This is shit
"I won't go mainstream dog," I think that's why ppl trying to be true to themselves in this crazy world are so drawn to Tom's tunes. Dancing grannies!
Anti Christ Cross on the skee mask. Watch out. He sold his soul to THE DEVIL. Sucks.
Love the message and Tom, but I feel he's reaching the end of his material.
Oh man this is amazing!! Thank you Tom and the crew! This uplifts the American Spirit in so many ways!! I’m definitely buying another one of your CD’s today!! God Bless you!!❤️
This Shit 2 hard bro‼️‼️‼️‼️
Tom doesn’t disappoint
Love this video!!  One of my favorites for sure!!
Keep on rioting!!
Ngl, Not the biggest fan of this song, just being honest. But keep it up Tom 👍
🔥🔥Let's Start A RIOT!🔥🔥 #itunes #amazon
LETS START A RIOT
Lil bro thinks he’s Machine Gun Kelly, and Kelly isn’t even that good to begin with
#HOG4LIFE
At first I was honestly like fuck this guy but hell it took a while to hear your message and I’m glad I did man keep it up
Thank you for the great music, Tom and Nova!
Not my style of music but the lyrics are really good.
I love this guy’s attitude 🙏🏻🔥 stand up 💪🏼 against the machine ! F this system
LET'S START A RIOT!
The editing, the song, the beat, everything about "riot" slaps hard as fuck. good shit tom nova, and jared!!!

Homie you done did it again another banger that spits truth greatest rapper of the modern era
🔥🔥Let's Start A RIOT!🔥🔥 #itunes #amazon
It's ok. You have done better. Not saying this is bad or less than acceptable, I have heard better from Mr. Mcdonald. That's all.
Fire
i pray that my music goes viral like this one day. 🤍
White pac please stop. Please go back to trailer hillbilly rap.
I have you playing, I Really Like this song & video.  Hoping you get to & keep #1
Really good video!  Enjoy 💯 the video very much.
Tom.. nova and Jared did that I'll never be able to have my music vids this awesome maybe one day
Shazam it as much as possible!!! 😳👍
Lmfao at all the conservatives loving his music just because he's "anti-woke" when they'd never listen to this shit otherwise. And in the video, bro has an inverted cross on his facemask...
Badass, love what you stand for!!
Wow! It's so cool!!! 🤘🦾❤️✌️👍
the sets for this vid are so dope tho
there Tom goes stealing my coat again
Too bad we will all die while screaming the same thing no one cares til there life is on the line then they want someone to care about their life
The green glasses give me Riddler and the Great Oz vibes. 🔥🔥🔥🙏
Let's start a riot! 🔥
I don't know whether to call this alternative rap or just rap
there is a video going around "auto generated by youtube" of this song with no video... wont that hurt the views on this video...
Tom didn't need anyone, but now he has TimCast trying to boost him, just to counter the culture 😂😂
Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!
Hey Tom, I will be 62 this month, and I have to say, not much of a rapper fan, but I love hearing the lyrics from your songs
AWESOME. SO AWESOME💚💚💚💚💚💚🇺🇸😍😘
AWESOME. SO AWESOME💚💚💚💚💚💚🇺🇸😍😘
I was a rocker since I was a child Rock has always been my true music genre love... Tom. I followed you since the beginning and never have I heard something like this before. "Hangover gang. resting in peace. ready for war" - inscription on my dog tags alongside my military tags.
❤ 😍 your music 🎶
U n ur girl r fukn amazing!!!!!!!!
Let’s go!   Also, let’s collaborate and get on your next guitar song TOM 🙏🤘
I bought the song and just going to listen on repeat on YouTube so you can chart man you deserve it.
Go on Timcast IRL bruh
🎼⭐⭐🔥
Exactly
This one gave me goose bumps Tom!
keep on saying the word of the word people thank you God bless you
You have your finger on the magic of truth.  Tom you are an original.  A one of a kind deliver.  I'm digging it.  Stay groovy as long as you can.  We need you voice.
I wonder why the industry is so quiet when it comes to this AAA artist with countless #1's?  Oh yeah if you don't know, his name is Tom MacDonald, an agent of free speech and a soldier of freedom.
Great distortion choice.
Is this about Token? Lol
👏👏👏
loving the guitar riffing and the powerful chorus hits hard. I love it! I mainly listen to metal and this sht slaps! nearly 2m views in 3 days? keep it raw my dude
Love the flowing skulls. Nice.
One thing I like about Tom Macdonald he doesn't use bad language only mild like damn and hell
🔥🔥Let's Start A RIOT!🔥🔥 #itunes #amazon
Tom needs to get past himself. When I saw the title “Riot” I thought it was going to be one of his incredible songs that speaks legitimate facts. He’s released several and I’ve become a fan. But I’m not buying this shit about him being this infinitely hard scary person. I’ve seen a picture of him smiling with normal hair and only one tattoo in his twenties. He was a frat boy. He clearly doesn’t have a long history of crushing skulls considering he’s in his early thirties. I’m so sorry but I see these videos and I don’t believe a thing he’s saying. I’m not saying that he’s soft at all but I’m not buying what he’s selling.
Tom you are simply AMAZING 👏 ❤️  Best Music I have ever heard .. you and Nova both are Fantastic
SO AMAZING
The beat,the music,the scene,your voice is great.   The words feel empty and things you already said.   I guess not every song can be great and tell a new story,but still I dont really see myself listening this on repeat or in the car. You can do better,so do it.
Fuuuuck yeah dude I fucking love it man. Thanks for everything you all do man hell to the fuxk yeah baby
Still on repeat 3 days later
TOM OTTO HIGHTOWER 📢📢📢📢
If people are crying when they see Tom MacDonald, it’s because theyre 12yr olds that’ve mistaken him for MGK.
I am a big fan of yours Tom. You and Nova are a blessing to have in this fucked up world. My family is from Canada and I think everyone who says you aren't an American are the exact people who hate this country. Brainwashed is one of my favorites and the system is most definitely the one I blare the most now.
#8 trending for music as of 9/12/22 well done Tom. I didn’t know who you were until I heard about you while listening to Tim Pool. Now I’ve listened to almost all your songs. Some have made me think harder about society, some hype me up for the gym, and some had broke me down crying.  Keep doing your work man and keep fighting!!!
The rap mixed with the hard guitar.   epic
Another banger 🔥
Love the work Tom but we get it man, the industry hates what you stand up for.
Another epic performance. Love you Tom!! 💜🎶 mic 🎤drop!!
Sent by timcast, stayed for the music
You're inspirational AF!!!
Hey Nova !!!  Girl u the reverse Jezebel !  🔥 As usual !  Sorry Tom had to compliment your better half !  Please don't chokeslam me 😛  For real though...  Nova you should shoot a full length film where Tom is on a hit mission trying to conquer his black eyed monster.  Title it   Me VS Monster  The kicker being ol black eyes jumps between Toms fans fallen style...  So he never knows if the fan love is real or ego eyes trying to repossess him.  I'd bring 33,000 to see it  ∆∆∆°°°π
Still the biggest, what now  #HOG
Let's start a riot 🔥🔥
Regarding you Twitter BTS Equation flow through video in case Twitter shadow bans me...   Im a base 140 iq and damn bro you had me like...  Carry the one ?  Ok now how do I boil the equation ?!!!  Shit ..  Was that with or without Will Smith ?!  Damn it now I spilled Toms genius on my notebook  Fuq....  Now I want to Riot !  Oh shit Tom Macdonald just dropped a song !

when's the concerts?
🔥🔥🔥
YO TOM I LOVE THE LIGHTNING AND BONES 🔥🔥🔥
Yes, just worked it out! Knew you were to f’in a good guy to believe half the shit and MJF reminded me… it’s always easier to be the heel rather than the face… please tell me it’s so, so you can tour UK & Europe?
You better watch out, you better not cry You better not pout, I'm telling you why, why? The New World Order's coming to town They're making a list And checking it twice They're gonna find out who's gonna worship the papal antichrist New World Order's coming to town They see you when you're sleeping They know when you're awake They watch you through electronic device But you think this news is fake You better watch out, it's the all seeing eye You better take the mark/chip, I'm telling you why The antichrist is coming to town Little horn, is in the book of truth But they don't explain who he is in the catholic confession booth The papal antichrist is coming to town christmas is a nimrod pagan ritual tool But they don't teach you that in catholic school The antichrist is coming to town The kids and girls in boy land Will have a jubilee They're gonna build a toy land town All around a satanic tree You better watch out, you better not cry You better not pout, I'm telling you why The freemasons rule global corporate ground The antichrist is coming to town.
Nice!!!
I am not a rap fan but Tom's lricks & message draw me in.  Here's to blowing up the charts.
I'll definitely listen to him over Slim Shady
Even though Tom MacDonald is new he's reaching G.O.A.T status in my opinion
Can't wait to see you in that suit.  You gonna make that #1.
as always.... good stuff man.
Great song once again. I think you should consider becoming a movie director. Your videos are always so creative and well done.
Love it!
🔥🔥Let's Start A RIOT!🔥🔥 #itunes #amazon
Excellent
Very disappointed you didn't add a break down in with the guitar it would  have slapped. Great song as per usually
Hi Tom..stay humble...Thank God everyday for blessing you. Don't become one of those celebrities that become arrogant . I'm 56 years old and found you on YouTube. I love your music and what you stand up for 💖
Love this track! Riot is on repeat it bumps
Yes Tom back at it again with another 1 … it’s mad bro not 1 of your songs have been a flop every single 1 amazing   Also nova amazing skills on the video edits as always
Middle fingers up in the air 🖕🥴🖕

Látlak Tom! Örülök neked! 🤜🤛  I see you Tom! I'm happy for you!🤜🤛
This one has to go to the top! 62 years old and loving your music!
You are Awesome and Amazing,  been listening and representing you since day 1 , !!!!!!!
This is dope as hell mate.
Hop on a cycle of test and tren and get jacked everyone will start talking about you lol
I like his passionate songs about the Illuminati, patriotism, decency, God and other meaningful/important topics more than ego-centric standard rap concepts/lyrics.    This one is skillful, and quality composition, but meaningless compared every other song of his.  Still as fan so long as he doesn't sell us into new agey or occultic crap like all corporate labels artists.   Oh damn! A figure in the crucifixion pose who can reverse gravity, standing on a pile of bones, lightening crash in background ("threw him down from heaven as if lightening from the sky"), singing about they want him  yet wherever he goes there's chaos (anti-christ concept) and, of course, demon eyes....yup, he already has.  This might as well be a Sony artist.  More be an animal, focused on ego and luciferian etc propaganda for evil.  I don't believe he's "in" the cabal, I think perhaps this song's spiritual inspiration was not from an energy that he and Nova should listen to again.  The integrity and I'd say PERHAPS divine inspiration of his other stuff way better for the world than this skillful-yet-standard piece.   Doubt he'll see this, but if he and/or Nova have been getting into new age spirituality between THE BRAVE and this single, maybe reconsider?  You can do some real good to IMPROVE society - and HAVE with most of your previous work.  PLEASE don't lose that goodness and passion for goodness, dudes.
Let's start a riot!🔥
Anarchy? Is Canada that bad?
Absolute banger as always guys! Shout out to nova helping make these videos INSANE!
@cuxthroat - STAINS https://youtu.be/cMmv4t57ORk
Who he dissing here? He definitely talking to somebody!
Meh....
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GlXvhpIrN8A&t=46s  Tom diss track
Would be great to see him live.
Visuals off the chain!!! LOVE the Crickets!! 😍Regardless of my non-favorite genre (rap), I do love the voice tone and Tom always has such great lyrics (bars-wise). VERY niiiiiiiiissss❣🥰
🔥🔥 Let's Start A RIOT! 🔥🔥 #itunes #amazon
Dear Tom I am a 63 year old grandpa who is raising 5 grandkids and I don't view videos online as a rule but I thank you so much because you are a singular talent in the world and your lyrics are so thought provoking that I share them with my grandkids. God bless and keep on keeping on!😁🙏
Intro to his new stuff keeps getting better. Fan since white boy and still picking all his albums. Good stuff Tom everybody get ready cause this man is saying everything that needs to be said for this country.
Yes :)

Who was Tom dissing in this one?
🔥👀
LOL liked the call-out of the ridiculous self promotion that has become ubiquitous in the rap scene.
This is amazing! You have the power to transform everything you and Nova are doing is exceptional your showing you don't need the industry when you have talent and the balls to work for what you want. Much love to and yours can't wait to see what you do next
You nail down the truth.
Let's start a riot!🔥
Okay that upside down cross on the mask , every video i bee seeing tell tale signs of membership to illuminatti , he could be independent and still be illuminatti funded..
this track is moving back up the YT trending chart. Let's FN go fam!!!!
Protect this man at all cost's 🔝🔝🔝🔝🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔋🔋🔋
Heat
Not a fan of this song tom your better than this im still a big fan of yours and i know you can make better music than this
Seems like you keep hitting the same themes.  Clown world and fake woke were amazing, don't look down was outstanding.  But I'm getting bored with the "I'm independent and I won't sell out" message.  It's an important message, but you've made it, lets move on.  How about addressing when life starts, or ends....  (expand on heartbeat on Earth vs bacteria on mars argument)   Or how always going to the left leads to clown world but always going right leads to serfdom with no revolts (revolting is a liberal thing).  How about a message like "everyone hates the law but the law is how we maintain our freedom"? Love your work!  Please continue making it.
I'm broke as fuck. I'd buy if I could. I would put this on replay here if they had it. But I  listen to it here and will more than several times a day. I can't wait to here who the diss is about!!!!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤

Nice!
Me…911 911…What’s the emergency? Me…I want to report a slaying! 911…Say no more…Its Friday! Tom’s Day!❤️
Killed it AGAIN...Love n RESPECT ❤

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Another day another Tom McDonald banger..💪
Let’s start a riot
Go gettem boys 🎉
Bring back straight white male tom
Or  irrumabo off Jack im ignis probationem Fuck of Jack I'm fireproof.  Would love to hear you throw a Latin line in, or two xx
Again tom, for the British veteran that came to your music via a Mormon missionary who showed me white boys. That day I have been blessed to have your music. Air my frustration through your linguistic genius.  To you and NoVa God bless you both, "ne nothi tere te" don't let the bastards grind you down... xxx
The beat goes hard 🔥 🔥
Does tom still think 911 was a foreign attack? I'm so not sure where this guy sits...
Still need that killer hook, but love to see his rap skills on display.
Wrist bleed blood Screens
I AM wat i is, blesseed
High n drink and healthy- I'MM BLLESSZED
Lets start a Riot!!
Do you have a cd available for this yet or is it just a song off something bigger?
You guys are so versatile! greatings from Brasil.
Great Video. Continue your great work Tom. Fick das Establishment (German for "F.. the establishment")
Never heard you autotune.  Never liked it but you have a way of making things epic and yippy def delivered here. Hell yeah Tom can't wait to be able to get this CD ✌
not a fan
Can’t stand autotune!!! Tom you have a good strong voice you don’t need it but, it seems that you’re using it more & more often. Please reverse this progression seriously you don’t need autotune. With it your voice sounds thin & not as powerful as it is on previous tunes. Hopefully you’ll read this & can take a bit of constructive criticism from someone that really enjoys your artistry. The contradiction I see is that you’re against “The System & The Industry” but, autotune is an industry standard that’s so over used & certainly one of the main reasons I don’t listen to mainstream music. Nova, I’m sure you’ve been working hard on your own tunes also can’t wait for you to release your next album/CD I know it will be amazing,fingers crossed it won’t be too much longer. Just say NO to autotune please & thanx in advance.
Tom, I hear you bro, let's hope people take out the earplugs and blind folds and really hear and see your message.
Shit mountain  Noce                                        (Not shit talk if you don't know go to his insta 🙄)
Love that metal riff.
✊🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
What's up with all the "I'm old and don't like rap but I like this"comments on every one of his vids
Not a fan of political Tom but this right here is fire 👍
lmfao this highkey cringe
Nice work young grasshoppers!! Love it. 💣💥✊🤪🤩🤭
#LetsStartARiot 🔥🔥✌🏼
Always supporting Tom! Give'em hell bro!
This sounds like a diss track, who you beefin with?
I play your songs in stores as loud as my phone can be so people can hear your messages! I do that a lot! You are excellent!
Let's start a riot
🔥🔥🔥
Damn Tom! That was a hard one! Much love ❤️
Why is it censored? Where is all the fuk words hahah
Is this a diss at the industry?
LET'S START A RIOT!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
lol YouTube trying to bury the song by not showing it in search suggestions and no notifications! Haven’t they learned you can’t hide a fire this lit! 🔥🔥🔥
Those visuals though 🔥🔥
just already started off with a banger again
Been a musician for decades and I can tell when you have someone like this who is so good they are able to pull in such a diverse audience you know they have something special.
Keep them coming Tom your messages are loud and clear
I'm feel this.....
Ooohhheeee kids! 😁🤘 Another 100% banger! This one's a masterpiece as well 😎 H. O. G. gonna run this bitch
Tom you were not joking about the visuals in this video! Awesome job and great music! Never stop.
Far out , you the man dog
🔥🔥
Top work.
Just here to add views... already been listening on rumble fuk u tube

Monday riot!
I really love the aesthetic in the video and the chorus is fire!
Holy Sh*t, this song is amazing!
LET'S START A RIOT 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
LET'S START A RIOT 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wish more people would just give you a chance and open their minds
Tom, Not sure if you'll ever read this or maybe someone in your group / circle / click will see this, but I always hoped more people could hear your music.  There's a huge group that still does not even listen to artists on YouTube... I've been a fan since I 1st heard white boy; and honestly, more people need to hear what you need to say.   Even those on the mainstream airways.  Keep being Tom, Tom!
this got mgk vibes bro your shit usually original af
Love this one just like the others. Your talent amazes me
Hit after hit after hit.
Yo
Let’s start a riot!!!
Wow! 🤘🏻
Banger!

Damn! Nova outdid herself this time! Hot shit!
Get it boy!!!
HOG Army Let’s start a RIOT
We gotta get Tom to Number 1 and show the music industry how Independant artists don"t need them
If Tom self-censors like this a little more he gonna keep getting bigger due to being able to listen around our kids.
Why you quiet?! Let’s get loud!!!
Lets Start A Riot
🔥🔥 Let's Start A RIOT! 🔥🔥 #itunes #amazon
About time you talked some shit. Set Your Heart Ablaze 🔥
Drop the formula already bro make sum different😂😂 all your videos are practically the same and the flow for every song is the same
Tom is a god 🙏
Not bad. I was hoping for more bars and a bit less chorus though. Maybe this is just the YT version?
🎼Ashes🎼 to 🎼Riot🎼…“My favorite Rapper is a Rockstar”… 🎸🍒🥧🤌🏻
Is it just me, or.... does anyone see the parallels to Trump / Biden?  Almost every line in the song could relate to the Trump / Biden saga.  Not saying that it is but..... maybe not coincidental?
LETS START THIS RIOT!!! LET GET TOM TO NUMBER ONE ON YOUTUBE AND ITUNES!!!!
Love it
🔥 🔥 🔥 ☑️
lets  take it to number one . i like what u stand for
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Nice work keep it up!!

Let’s start a riot!!!!
Let's start a Riot!!
Butane 🔥
see you in orbit :)  good to see rap getting back to basics with real reasons not what the corps want truly awesome work well done!
This ones pretty dope... All Tom's best tracks are just his stories, not politics... No Response, Best Rapper Ever, Don't Look Down, Can't Sleep, Hanging On. Music isn't made to back up ur world views, its just an artistic form of expression.
Let’s Riot!
Yes. Bless you sir
I pray I get as famous and popular as Tom in a good way, doing it my way. Maybe not rapping though.
I love the way He moves his arms in this track, with damn good style.
I only do?
My brother🔥🔥..💯💯lit
WHY SO QUIET?
I love rap with some rock in it!!!
You look so freaky in this video!!!!
I don't have an iPhone. Tried to download via Amazon but my device is incompatible.  I want to help you blow mainstream put of the water... but how? Does downloading it on youtube help at all? Cause I've done that!
https://youtu.be/NOCw4MoQ3xc?t=13 bazookas !
This is 🔥🔥🔥🔥! Man you just keep getting better and better and better!!!
Absolute BANGER!!!! I give this 1,000,000 🔥🔥🔥
For someone who doesn't listen to rap music but  this is dope music
Let's start a riot
🦗🦗🦗 crickets 🦗🦗🦗  Why so quiet 🤐 Everywhere I go it's a riot! 💥

Not my favorite, but another one on fire by Tom ... get it!
LET'S START A RIOT 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
LET'S START A RIOT 🏆🏆🏆🔥
I find it very enjoyable that Tom isn't one of those artist that just keeps changing the lyrics over the same tracks.  This was an amazing example of that very thing.  Tom, great to see you and Nova are having such wonderful success.  You are the epidemy of people finding the American dream.  Great song!!
Ayyyyeee let's go to war!!!
Independent music 👏🏻
Maga
LOVED the guitar! 🤘 Another hit!! 💯‼️
Amazing as always 🥰

Awesome video @TomMacDonald I absolutely love the beat! Playing it on every single TV, iMac, MacBook, PC, iPhone, Apple TV & HomePod in our entire house. On repeat!   #HangOverGang 4 life 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Who is this about Tom?? Adam??
Ever thought about taking your best rap homie to Jerusalem and rapping in sackcloth just to see if you're one of the two witnesses? You'll know you are when fire sprays out of your mouth upon the enemies of God.
https://youtu.be/EzDrWDREsJ8
Subscribed and alert on. Yet Riot never showed up on my computer. Wondered where you had been and found Riot. I guess the YouTube WOKE team has shadow banned you.. Just thought I'd mention it... Love and prayers to you Brother and your family, Blood and Otherwise.
YOUR SO AMAZING!!!
Tom your doing it let's break the industry!!!
I have never really been  fan of CRAP aka country and rap.... but some country is good and some rap is good.   I gotta  say Tom doesn't fall in the CRAP catagory...  and will probably listen to gang gang after I listen to this song again.... as a fellow canadian with morals and values just keep being yourself cuz well like Nova said   you are my gang gang and I got mad respect for ya for you being you keep being real and keep being  you.  My dad died 3 years ago today so just saying I know pain and keep doing what you do I appreciate  you being you Tom.   I got your back
Love it!
I LOVE when TMAC gets into his ROCK/RAP bag!!!  This song is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 So Tom…….who ya talking about?? Whisper it to me & I won’t tell anyone.😁 ❤️❤️❤️❤️ y’all!!  Not gonna lie, I missed y’all, bruv!! #HOG THE ARMY BABY MILLIONS STRONG AND GROWING!!!💯💪🏼❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
This song is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
So I absolutely love you and everything you stand for but this was not my favorite by any means good graphics. Just seems like a lot of self glorifying lyrics. But what do I know anyway keep standing up for the little guys and conservative values!
Powerfull🔥Tom😌
HEAVY METAL TRUTH RAP.   A NEW GENRE.   LOVE IT!  TIM POOL SENT ME HERE!
brilliant
Let's Gooooooo Riot!!!
🔥🔥🔥
This is my favorite in a second just cuz the flex
Hereee
Short song but good. I did a cover of 1 of your songs. I am guessing you have 1 or 2 new CDs coming out soon? I hope.
keep up the good fight Tom
🔥
I wish I had the views Tom does on my music....meh🤣🤣🤣He's earned his way Tom is skilled songwriter😀thx for another wicked dope banger Tom
Sounds amazing on my system. I have been listening to it since Friday every time I get in my car!!!
dope shit man keep it up
#9 on trending for music 2 days after the release, fuck yes Tom. I first heard you a couple of years ago when I was going through some serious shit, and it really helped out. Keep it up man!
Awesome job Tom you came along way from MySpace days
FUCK YEAH. LETS GO TO WAR!!!!!
💥🔥💥
I’m excited lolz
Let’s start a riot !
Get off YouTube help Andrew tate bro look up the movement
I've been hiped since u pronounced the song
Not going to lie, this song might be my favorite sound of your entire discography. Not my favorite song because I like the ones where you are more uplifting, like Angels and Castles. But this... this hard-rock and rap combo, it's everything I loved about Limp Bizkit back in the day but even better :) Love the energy, love the message, love your music, keep it up my friend, can't wait until the industry has no choice but to acknowledge you, and it doesn't seem like we are very far off.  Just wanted to edit really quick to note that I love Ashes too, I know you've done this sound before but I got to your music hella late so I wasn't around when that song was new :) Hoping that you see this but I know it's super unlikely lol
So spotify either plays ads or eminems venom when I go to your page. Yo the BS is real. No option To buy. Downloading iTunes tomorrow to try again. They did this sh to timcast too. But I'm not here for that. Just saying they're clamping down on the outsiders.
Awesome vid brother.  Love the vibe and lyrics and that beat is next level.  Keep it up.
Yes. yes. And yes. Definitely hits home. Banger for sure. Congratulations on the song and video sir.
🚫🧢👉🏻🥴💨You are mainstream lmfaoooo 🤣😂😭💀⚰🪦💯
And yet another kick ass song dude,i play guitar,have for 48 years & the guitar is freakin awsome,love the tone. Keep it up man... PEOPLE SEE YOU PEOPLE HEAR YOU AND THEY ARE STANDING UP.
It’s repetitive but it still works.
I was listening to your most excellent tunes and this bar came to mind when thinking about the way social media works.   You got 3000 friends but nobody knows you, 10000 likes and no one that likes you.
I can't figure out the message? Just no money = happiness? I miss your long lyrics about antiwoke.
I love the way you're trying to put the system out on Front Street but riots are not the way
I apologize everything that's going on in this world terrifies me and you climbing on top of a bunch of skulls with fire coming out freaks me
Start a riot! Lets start a riot. You know i hate pop.
It's a Riot!
Oh wow I love it!! HOG FAN 4 LIFE!! Love how you kinda switched the sound up a bit from your other newer songs!! Freaking amazing!!
Hey Tom it's about that time Bob saying it's about that time this is a man of my life I have to say to you I don't think after watching that video that I will share it with my children or anyone else we need positive loving human beings in the world
Guys…share this video with everyone and get your copy from iTunes.   Tom and Nova work their brains out for us all the time.   The encouragement I’ve gotten from learning and understanding that being counter culture is absolutely fine is priceless.  I feel like I found my tribe with the Hangover Gang.   I felt so alone but now I don’t.  Let’s rally around Tom and Nova and let them know we love and support them.   That’s what family does.
You are fucking awesome
Well job
#RIOT
I'm a 65 year old woman  and I love you.

Pure banger Tom, 🔥🔥.  Make it heavier, nastier. Bring the on the madness!!
I can’t believe none of the big music labels have signed you… Because you’re so unique and talented and you’re blowing up the charts as an independent artist > you would kill it if you had a big contract and you could do world tours
Riot
I like you bro but "white Pac"?? Ain't no such thing

I love this song and the video is dope,
meh, not my cup of tea. I do wish you the best on your independent journey. Fuck the industry. They have sold us our 100X over.
Encompassed by heathen, those who cut themselves off from The Lord God Almighty. Those who deny and blaspheme His name, they mock and ridicule.  Oh how the mighty are puffed up with pride, scoffing, mocking, bringing the serpents tongue, spreading lies, spitting venom upon those that they see as beneath their feet, they trample what they see as weak under the foot.  Woe unto this wicked generation, calling good evil and evil good.  Drunken of self righteousness, tables drenched with innocent blood. Howling hyenas circling, stalking,  menacing teeth devouring in the darkness.   Do you fear not the everlasting Fire burning, burning, burning.   Consumed by self, walking in blindness, moral decay, lawlessness raging, spinning violently out of control, destroying everything in its path.  There hearts are turned to stone.   Oh how the proud bathe in wickedness, lusting after their own desires. They speak prideful speech, latching on to lies, creating idols, Manipulating words, seeking to steal away from you your eternal birthright.   There abominations done in secret are forever known to The Most High God, He see's the wickedness.  He see's the ugliness of their hands. Drenched with the blood of the innocent.  God alone hears our cries, Oh how His heart is broken.   Woe to you who do not seek truth, Woe to the proud and arrogant fool, Woe to the viper spitting venomous curses,   For I see One coming, a horse riding fast, and He who sits upon it is known as Righteous and True, out of His Mouth a sharp two edged Sword. He is from Everlasting to Everlasting.  Every eye shall see, every mouth confess, every knee shall bow. Proceeding before Him, The ever consuming Fire of His Righteousness. For He brings Righteous Judgement, reconciling every injustice.  All shall fear Him, some a righteous fear, to others, a horrifying fear.   He is the One who laid down His life and took it up again, by His Power.  He is The Lord Jesus Christ, Almighty God who came in The Flesh.   To you who are broken hearted, mourning,  Suffering, lost, meek, sick, hungry, empty, crying out. He, our Lord And Savior Jesus Christ is coming. He will wipe away every tear from your eyes, mend your brokenness, hold you to Himself, cradling you in His arms and He will tell you....... I Love You My Child.   He is talking you home, a place that no eye has seen, He prepared it for you.   How we Love our Heavenly Father.  Praise be to his name for ever and ever...
Just watched your Instagram live video and I'm here to do my part... Let's start a riot!!!!!!!
🎶🎶🎶
My favorite so far! TOM 🐐
That skitch on the guitar is 💯🍻
Props to @tommacdonald not only on your self preservation in a business that not many excell at but more importantly your independent thinking and not being swayed from speaking your mind HONESTLY! I have said this many times "this is not my genre but I watch every video you put out because your words speak volumes and I can't help but respect that! Keep doing what your doing brother!✌🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
This isn’t my kind of music, but damn! This song is really growing on me.
Let's start ä Riot 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Let's truly face the simple fact, civil war is coming. It's going to be We the People v. US Government. Local law enforcement have to choose, are they an American citizen first or government employee first. Choose wisely LEO's
Awesome video!!!

When we gonna get a tour tom that would be killer if ya did 1
I love how my son is on the back porch singing the chorus to this... 🎧🎶😁😅  🤘🏽🔥💛
As a huge Tom MacDonal fan, literally all I listen to these days. And agreeing 100% with what you're saying here. Acknowledging that this is by far the dopest video you've put out and that just goes to show your growth as an artist and team not only in talent but also funding to an extent atleast. This might be an unpopular opinion but I wanted to comment my thoughts to help the algorithm. Least favorite song I've heard in a while lyrically, again I agree 100% with everything said lol. Just didn't quite do it for me this time, and that's okay! It's still better than most anything else being released these days! Keep killing it Tom, we love you! Amazing video.
O yes
This song spots facts and the production is first class keep going upwards Tom, another banger
START A RIOT!!!!!!!!!
This song was amazing I love the mix of rap and rock . I'll admit I didn't like rap for along time but since finding the independent rappers like Tom , Nova also Adam and Upchurch I found rap i can vibe to . so LETS START A RIOT and  support Tom and Nova . H.O.G 4 LIFE
This new? How did I miss it?
HAHAHAAAAAA absolutly nailed this!!! BANGER FO SHO!!!!
Tim Pool brought me here with Dave Smith and Maj Toure
Love the metal and the reference to cardi b 🤣🤣🔥🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
I shared it with my Facebook people
,,Lets starts a Riot"💕

Killin it!
"Fuk the industry"-blondie "Hey industry can I get some money?"-also blondie
Let's start a riot"👍🏼🙃
This is your worst song. All I hear is feel sorry for me and worship me at the same time. Nova deserves better
This is the most cringeworthy thing I've ever seen.
Why does he censor the curse words?
Let’s start a riot
#LetsStartARiot 💯💯
Banger!!
🔥🔥 Let's Start A RIOT! 🔥🔥 #itunes #amazon
Eminem may be the idle that helped out you on the path but you have by far surpassed anything he has done or will ever do.
🎸🔥🎸🔥
🎤🔥❤️
It was alright.
So sad  he doesn't know the love of Jesus
Short song but f***ing powerful lyrics... Just wish I knew who it was directed at exactly... Seriously, who? Tom doesn't shoot at random. This was aimed at someone's head... "Doof. Doof. Doof."
Brooo this shyt 🔥🔥 dig the hard rap/rock 🤟😎🙌🙌🙌
Ive never sought out to be a rapper but my thoughts have always gotten out there you say everything I've ever wanted to say so i don't need to say it i just think its strange how even if where silence are thoughts will always get out there some how. I guess we are alike
Brought to you in part by Tom & Nova Industry Soulution Productions#$@!
sick video
The visuals,💥💥
Do you ever feel like someo else is teling you what to say
Man, I don't even listen to rap. But I love Tom Macdonald's music. And much respect for doing it all independent!
Who made tom mad 👀🙌🏻🔥
HangOverGang 🖤
This is by far the best production I've ever seen especially since he's 100% independent I tip my hat to you .y brother your a LEGEND brother these effects in this video nova your as talented as you are beautiful Tom you are blessed bro your girl is on fire your fans are on fire  every single song that comes out I bet you I share it over 200 300 times all over FB messenger text email all of it
Those rubber boots!
You should have never let anyone know that you are white!  Because so black people could openly listen without being criticized by other black folks!   I wish things weren’t like that, but for the most part  Things are! 😟
Love the graphics but I'm kinda confused on the message atleast to the fans 🤔
Utter garbage
Need more like this.
🔥🔥 Let's Start A RIOT! 🔥🔥 #itunes #amazon
Another satanic garbage rapper...
Got the email that was sent out. I’m here to help. ;)
Awesome music video now. Now work on your flow. I give this video an A for visually effects and a Yawn for lyrics.
Love this guy and his crew St Tom and queen Nova
great work your team is bad ass
Bought the song on all platforms here from Tim Pool
Thats a no from me dog.
Lets start a Riot!!!!
Let's start a riot!!!
The production value music and video content is so good. I didn’t know or why the song was over.
Let’s do this!
1:15 Triple H
Never thought Eminem would be unseated in my lifetime but TM did it and without selling out to the scumbuckets 🖕🖕
That's so cool, that's like Tupac and Metallica combined
I just listened to your Riot And yes I'm 61 female and I like it the lyrics are there in the song I listen to every word and I get it totally I understand where you're coming from and it makes all the sense in the world so thumbs up
Upside down cross below the right eye wow🤦‍♂️
I think  somebody needs  a sandwich and a nap
Damn!!!! That shit is heavy, luv that subtle Metal.
I’m getting strong with my power up
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is bad ass
Let's gooo
Tom you need to get your ass to vegas, open with this song. And we gonna go hard as fuck 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
😅😅
Lovely 🥀🥀
Nic 😭
Now that right there is quite a riot! 🤣
Tom McDonald is a messenger for today's ages.  He points the way to the future of an America rising from the dung heap of democratic communism.
I enjoyed it
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
another home run
♥️
Lit. Hands down best. keep it coming please.
I love all your music tom U r def up there if not better than Eminem even if u wasn't u still a special one ur message is better and videos for just being u guys the cgi work wow love you keep them coming my fav are the political ones but still love it all
I don't like it, sorry Tom there are bigger messages for you to give your people besides poor Tom not making the billboard chart cause you're an independent. Disappointed in you this time.. Everything before this was wonderful and I'm nearly 70..
Spin the UFO
Sounds more like a ring tone
I mean constructive criticism-wise I like almost all your music, but this isn't in my top 10, I feel like I've heard this story from you a few times already.    In my opinion lyrics need to be speed up a little bit and more of them, also a little more metal throughout instead of just spots, and not so much the poem reading style......   6 out of 10
Another banger from Tom and Hang Over Gang, abbreviated HOG because Tom is fully independent not sharing anything with any label!
Banger
I support your work sir.
This music video visual and song was epic! I respect independent, self taught, self hustle individuals! Tom, Nova & Jared are the realist and continue to challenge themselves within an independent lane and they are holding it down no matter what. He said “Mount Rushmore” but it looked like he’s standing on the bones of “Mount-Hatemore”! Shout out to the haters!😂😂👍🏽
Dope as always.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Nice one, that jacket is sick
Bro not only did you kill this…… YOU MURDERED IT!!!! STRAIGHT 🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

This beat goes sooo fucking hard
This the one
I Love All your songs!!!!
You supposedly told me I won $5,000. It's all BS!
Great video Tom
Good song and special effects I only wish there was 1 more verse.
Gooood damn.
Let's start a riot!
Man this song is sicker than Covid-19
Love this one! Definitely hits home! Thank you for Nova and your hard work as always!
am i the only one that noticed the inverted cross under his eye on the ski mask?... i just wonder what his message is by it. not that it bothers me at all. fuck religion
Tom that was fire 🔥 literally best song I've heard all year
Love it! Another banger Tom! Hang Over Gang
Going metal?

I am doing a commenting.
Another awesome song added to my downloads. My grandkids are still freaking out cause there grandmother listens to your music. Love you guys.
Nova sure has a great eye for framing and presenting your best songs!
1:08
I love you Tom and Nova and I know you are advancing your skills.  I don't want to come off as negative Nancy but I prefer your old school videos where you build the sets and Nova uses her fantastic skills in video creation.  You know how you want to preserve the "feel it in your hand" for your CDs.  Same kinda of thing for me with the videos.  I still loved it, but it felt a bit too CGI.  #Hog4ever
"White Pac in the flesh"? R u fukkin kidding me? How disrespectful to 2pac. This guy sucks 4real
Every time I watch it’s better.
🔥
Let's start a riot
Bro is killing it! Nova is apparently just a pro-level producer/editor at this point. I would love to see some behind the scenes stuff as well! Keep it up, guys!
He’s officially getting a little too full of himself. You were a frat boy and wrestler bro. You don’t have a long history of being a badass. Cutting your hair and getting tattoos doesn’t make you hard bro. Before the fans attack me I’m still fully subscribed and will watch his content because he makes wonderful music. Except this shit.
RIOT RIOT RIOT RIOT RIOT!! SICK VISUALS TOM & NOVA 💪💪🙏🇺🇸🎯
1:57 that voice change tho he always full of surprises
Lets start a Riot!!

Good job young sir
Timcast / Macdonald fans WYA! F the industry
I know nobody's comparing him to Eminem. That's crazy. Thus dudes trash. Don't disrespect Em like that.
https://youtu.be/7914zBRYa4A @king_D.rut
Man you give goosebumps everytime you drop your songs I used to get these chills from pac songs.
It's damned awesome!  My only gripe is that it's about 5 minutes too short. 😄
There's a riot
I freaking love it hog4life!
Let's start a riot !!
Got goosebumps. Kinda short however.
This song has so many layers it puts Shreck to shame!!!!! For real I listens to it 30 times and still getting something from it..!
I think I know who this song is to. Don't wantbto name drop them though. They aren't worth the views, and I only found them on accident.

Tom rocks. Love the music. Please keep going. Great stuff man!
Haha this is like comparing Trump rallies to Biden rallies 🤣🤣🤣 love it
We already know you're the best, Tom, so, please do tell us whats next, Tom?  Great visuals/video Nova
Mad music man, true story if you and an Eminem ever do a song together it would literally break the internet and the world. MAKE IT HAPPEN TOM!!!
Tom's the new Rage Against The Machine, especially when the original band started licking the boots of the establishment.
Downloaded and shared
I like this one, but so hard to pick my favorite song you have ever made
Going to riot
🔥🔥 Let's Start A RIOT! 🔥🔥 #itunes #amazon
We need a concert Tom. And we promise to keep Nova as safe as possible. We love you both.
The whole production was flippin crazy!!! Can't stop listening
I respect that you are a Canadian immigrant and now live the American dream! Keep rising! I appreciate your lyrics. This video is visually stunning.
Love it xxx💖💖

I will be honest, I am not a fan of hiphop, and listen mostly to heavy metal.  But Tom is growing heavily onto me.  I went on amazon music and bought everything from him.  Anyone know if we can donate directly to him?

This song seemed like a Marvel movie now a days purely visual with a shit script but in this case the song couldn’t have been more generic or lame definitely one of the worse songs released by Tom so far.
Great song!!
Cannot wait for more Nova songs. Love her voice.
Unity is within reach, liberating this country is doable, all we have to do is start a Riot and stick together united we stand, divided we fall. God Bless America and its Beauty.

Love the video graphics, display, feel - song?.. too short ( imo ) .. I really liked the vibe and tone on ' don't look down '.  Kudos! Keep at it!  Cheers from the T-dot.

A song or album with Tom macdonald and young wicked would be epic. "Still I rise" is part of the album "return of the prodigal son"  its a good place to start if you haven't heard of him.

Let's start a Riot
Just my opinion, but "Don't Look Down" was the pinnacle of songs about you v the haters, Tom. Unless you're gonna go harder than that, it's not a look down, but a step back. Just go hard.
#truth
Just here as a daily reminder that this video and song is dope! Let’s go #hangovergang it’s riot time!

I ALWAYS like your messages; however, I like some of your other songs more than this one. The Sheople are in great NEED of awakening. I believe God has called upon you to be one of the catalysts of the GREAT AWAKENING. I don't like most rappers because they are always promoting all this negativity, but I genuinely like you and your music. Thank you for everything you do!!

Super dope homie 🔥💯 #riot
Just downloaded Riot. Added to my road music.
Let's start a riot
By far you are my favorite artist out today! Riot is 🔥🔥🔥
Let's start a riot!  For real.  Folks need to realize the real riot will be when Christ returns and straightens this mess out but until then we all need to trust in him.  Trust that he died to pay for our sins, was buried and rose the 3rd day conquering death and the grave and all we gotta do is believe he did it for us. That's it.  No aisle to walk, prayer to pray, thing to do just believe trust like you've never trusted before and he'll take care of the rest by working in you  Then together we will start the biggest riot the world's ever seen when we return with him.
Riot🔥
Bought  on every platform ❤️❤️❤️
Tom I am fucking begging you to keep speaking on real issues. They hate us. The way you kill them is to talk about real issues. Don't focus on haters scum. Talk about what is happening. I don't have the money to pay for a record or anything. I live thru your music. It helps anyways. I need to bang because I'm on the streets and I don't deserve it. No shit.  Thanks Tom. You too Nova.
Not my favourite but the production value of the videos is amazing. Big congrats on surpassing a million views though!

Hell of a song...truly is. I just wish it was directed at Em. It obviously isn't. You're referring to someone that doesn't have a fan base, and one thing Em has is a whole stable of 40 and 50 year olds that still think he's the best. What a joke. Crawl out from under your rocks people.

You certainly delivered on the pre hype about all the effects on this song. I love how this has such a unique difference and we see even more style you bring us. The chorus reminds me a bit of Scars, some of your infamous stares into the camera reminds me of Don't Look Down, though both very different from this song. Well Done Tom & Nova!
Blessed

Holy sh*t! I’d say another Banger, but that wouldn’t it justice. Tom and Nova killed it on this one. From lyrics to visual effects… F*cking Wow!!
Let's start a riot!
Let's cut the lyrics and visuals for a second and talk about how fucking incredible the beat was. I would honestly pay money for just the beat itself. It's a masterpiece. That could be the theme music for any terminator film, scarey movie, game, anything. It's so dark and deep it hits on a different level in your soul
Let’s start a Riot!! 🤘🔥🥰💜
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.

I love the song and video, but, Am I the only one who might have interpreted this song differently?  Like, If Tom's death was to happen, he might fake his death putting rocks in his coffin, and keep making songs even though people think he's dead? Like how people talk about how 2 Pac still alive making songs..
Awesome video!!!!!

The physical sets that you can interact with and move around in are WAY cooler than this green screen shit.   Just looks like you are standing in a cheap screen saver that repeats the same short loop over and over.  (Because thats what it is).    Cool song though.  But comparing this to the videos like dear slim or the system, or everybody hates me or balloons or names or pretty much any of them that are real sets.   Its not even close. Those are simply better in my opinion.  You dont just have to stand still in one spot so it looks like some digital bones are flying around you with a completely static background.
💥💥💥
I love this! Tom you are an inspiration! I absolutely believe that you are the voice to us who are truly AWAKE. What I'm gunna need from you is a solid White Stripes/ ACDC/ Tom Macdonald ANTHEM for when WE THE MUTHAFUKIN PEOPLE take back our countries and say NO MORE! You are a lyrical genius and I am 100 percent confident you will create the next Star Spangled Banner/ Fight song for the proud men and women" Ultra Maga" Patriots of the USA!!!!

Time heals most of our wounds.. Most healings bleed through the pages.

Let's start a riot 🙃 You're the man Tom!!
I know Eminem was a big deal to you back in the day, he was to me too, but man, you have greatly surpassed Eminem. Your lyrics have content that matters. Your video production is perfect, minimal yet powerful. I honestly look forward to every song you release. I only discovered you earlier this year and i'm so glad i did! You weren't kidding on the "Don't Look Down" track, you are on a level so high that nobody will ever reach you. I turn 50 years old on the 28th, i have been following rap music for over 40 years and  let down for many of those years. You are legitimately the best i have ever heard/seen. I love the fact that you do it all on your own with Nova, its incredible the talent you bring to the table. this track is fire, Keep at it man, i'll definitely be paying attention as a fan! - "Don't look down!"

Let's start a riot!  Sounds great and visually stunning, Tom!
Hell yeah!!
I love all your music including this one but i but I thought the lyrics could be better. Now I’m not an artist or a writer but that’s just coming from a fan point I like when you talk about events that are going on such as political topics to human rights topics. With those songs I feel like you say the words I think but can’t manifest into words but you seem to put the words together that a lot of people think and/ or but have the balls to say. You are one of the few rappers I hear touching base on those topics. Would love to hear more songs like those but I have to say this song is amazing with the sound and visuals and lyric wise also. Just was hoping with the song name Riots I thought I would be about how the elites are laying out their whole plan as we speak but no one is talking about it. Was hoping you were gonna shed light on those topics
So the industry is still putting out another white rapper. Society doesn't Need Another white rapper.  P.s. leave the Rap & hip-hop music to the Black people.

Thanks nova and Tom, for all the hard work you do. I’m so happy and proud and I don’t even know y’all. One day I hope to break out of this “shit” and do something with my life.

This song is true dopest, I can’t wait to put it on top of my playlist

Once AGAIN BIG BRA A BANGER IS WAT WE NEEDED INDEED LOL
This is the LANE you should stay in TOM!  This ROCK-RAP lane is where it’s at!!!  I hope you more of this and less of the controversial stuff.  Your fans will support whatever lane you decide to drive in. 5yrs of the controversy is plenty for me even though you made some bangers.  Waiting to see which lane you will be taking next or are you gonna just drive the in all the lanes?  I’m in for the ride or die! ✌️❤️🤘

"Why so quiet" hits pretty hard.
Love the visuals. They suck you right in. Also I can't get over the guitar. So good. Excellent compostion. The whole vibe of the song is so ethereal and otherworldly. The apocalyptic visuals definitely set that tone as well. 10/10. Loving everything.

I am 💯 % HOG but I want the canceled, last year's tom back.  I feel he is lost right now. His songs are all great but we keep getting songs that don't bring the same feeling to alot of people. The feeling of wait let me think about this poop filled world we are in and why is bacteria life on Mars but a heart beat isn't life on earth. Stay on top of the world and never look down.
Video it's awesome....song is meh. Haven't heard much I've liked since "fake woke" now. Seems to be more of the same type of songs each time now. 🤷‍♂️
Start a riot!
Awesome song, download it today to take Tom to #1
That was great. You and nova do amazing videos.
Love it <3
Absolutely garbage
Love iy
LETS START A RIOT!!!!!
1st off what do I know I'm just some white boy from North Carolina who's been listening to hip hop and rap since 1979 1980 Tom you are a rap God !
Incredibly lyrics. Keep it up man!!
Kind of felt like this was for shady though, I could be wrong
Let's go Brandon.

"Let's Start A Riot"
LETS START A RIOT!
Dude… freakin yow! I had to watch this video twice, you just helped reignite a fire in my spirit. You have steadily been just knocking out hard hitting, bold faced fact fables which upend the card tables of those who sleep. Thank you man, for all the great songs and videos so far, and how they have helped so many other people on so many different levels. The biggest kicker my man, is this: everything you write about, is COMMON SENSE!  I LOVE IT MAN!!! Love you dude. Yall be good!!!
Let's start a Riot !!
YouTube still isn't notifying me on any of your new videos. They're trying to silence you 🤣
THIS... IS SO EPIC! TOM DOES IT AGAIN! AGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! I need this visual on a t-shirt!!!!
Let's start a Riot! But not like the "summer of love"
LET'S START A RIOT!!
One other thing Tom, experiment with different structures. A lot of your songs are: Verse 1 Verse 2 Chorus Verse 3 (Verse 4) Chorus (Verse 5) (Verse 6) (Chorus) Bridge Chorus  I love rock n roll, because they're very versatile when it comes to music and songs. Many times rock doesn't follow this structure.  Just a suggestion from a friend- experiment more.  Cheers.
Love the crickets. Guess they got nothing to say lol
lets start a riot!
Where and when!? We ready to RIOT!

This is 🙀🙀🙀🔥🔥🔥
Honestly, he's had better. I'd say "Names" was one of his best. You can go down the list with other greats- Brainwashed, Best Rapper Ever, White Boy, Snowflakes, Castles, and America (the ones I can remember). But I wouldn't put "Riot" on that "great list".  - Though, I really do love the metal guitar riffs in this one. I know you've worked with those in few other songs. Continue experimenting more with guitar riffs.
Keeping the Riot going #riot #letsstartariot #trending

Wow! 2nd Time Youtube failed to notify for another T-Mac banger, and I pay for YT premium . . This legit came through as an Ad randomly when watching something entirely different on a friends Roku tv. Shyt must have cost Tom a whole lot to get that Ad slot.  Glad to hear another🔥song from you! Keep waging that war on all them mainstream fakes. We all know they don't want your messages out. 🤙
Let's start a riot!
Man just stop
You're always great (and independent). This one sucks imo. Mostly it's because the cheesy CGI background looks so bad after the incredible hard work you put into other songs prior. When I buy your music it's not for _X-Men 17._ Damn. -_- youtu.be/H5kt27itT4U <3

I love Eminem but hey I love your common sense and your truth. Your logic. He may be skilled but he jumps (as he should) to defend his daughter but he is over protective (through targeting also as he should). My point is he is so spun on if he is tops that he is forgetting his roots. You never seem to forget your roots.
Let's get it started in here.  Riot.
Boring always sings about the same shit. We know  your independent you bring it up in all your songs.
I couldn't comment on facebook you got my like and share bro another awesome tune 👌
Definitely one of the best songs on pandora right now. Been sporting the Tom McDonald station for a long while now. Long time fan here.

🙉Omgoodness Tom!! If it weren't for Shaq doing his reaction video to this I wouldn't have known it had landed!! I havent gotten ANY notification AT ALL!! I've been so caught up in the craziness that's been going on in my life I just completely lost track.... ive been battling with a major Lupus flare for months now but shit really hit the fan when my husband threw his back out!! Spend 4 days in the hospital.... its just been crazy.... But daaaaaamn son!! I'd love to know who you had in your mind when you wrote this track!! And the VISUALS!!!!!!!! Nova JUST KEEPS GETTING BETTER!!!! Expanding her skill set!! Just such an absolute LEGEND!! The BOTH of you!! The world ain't never seen a duo like you two!! You really are making history with every drop!! Hopefully your setting a precedent for the young folks trying to come up, and eventually the independent artists will out number the labeled or at least get to big enough numbers that it forces the industry to change.... ALLLL of the music, and arts industries!! These kids will stop selling their names, or signing away the majority of the profits from their first 3 to 6 albums.... I am going to unsub, and then resub and make sure my bell is set to all again, and hopefully that will fix what ever the problem is!!... I even went back through my notifications to see if some how i had just missed it/them or something and their was nothing for over at least a week.... i didnt even think to look at the date so i could tell you, but omgoodness sorry for rambling it just kind of erked me that i didnt get to see it as soon as you dropped it.... you can't imagine how much I look forward to your drops, and even more so when I actually get the chance to be one of the first hundred or so to like and comment!!!!!! Truly it makes my day, as silly as it sounds.... But I gotta run, just had to let you know I didn't get any notifications about this drop, and come to think of it.... I cant remember when I last saw a community post or anything for that matter, im gonna have to go back through and look again and see what the date was of the last notification I received for your channel.... But holy bananas shutting up now!! Lmbo!! As always hun, sendin you n Nov lots of love and MommaBear Hugs from Ohio!!!! 🥰🥰🐻🤗🥰🥰

ME: "I respect the f*ck out of Tom, but this one isn't really what I'm looking for."  ALSO ME: *Proceeds to listen to this song on repeat for the next 3 hours*
Let's start a riot!!! Another masterpiece!!!
I don’t know man. The last few have been misses for me. Great visuals, but the song lacks again; and another corny chorus. The over produced autotune is cheesy as fuck. It was cheesy as fuck when Tupac did it in the 90s. Just my opinion. Love to everyone out there.
Love your work and message. 🔥
FIRE
Bro Tom, this is the song that my sister has finally said she likes, I’ve been trying to get her ass to warm up to you for years but she won’t give you a chance for some reason🤣🤣 Keep fucking killing it I’ve been with you supporting you for a minute, I love the savageness and the music video, also it feels like you are shadow banned Orwellian style🤣🤣, that just means I’ll do my best to help you over come that shit, keep it real and stay hard Tom🔥🔥💯!
Tom MacDonald's production of his music videos truly is amazing for being completely independent!! Shout out to the Hangover Gang!!
I'm tired of looking at creepy s***.btw.

Best beat to date....
I thank the music Gods for you everyday.
This song is actually amazing - only if almost all of his songs weren’t very questionable views
Absolutely amazing!  Tom, Nova, the fam, the team, y’all are incredible! TALENT OVERLOAD! #HOG ❤️
Lets start a riot love this song and video great job nova
LET'S START A RIOT
I bought your song brother
LET'S START A RIOT
I really don't understand how it went from dear rappers to bragging about strippers. Sorry not sorry. I do respect the amount of attention Tom has given to problems that have cropped up. Wonder when he'll drop the Tom vs Jerries single and light up the Nazis
Let's start a riot for Tom!
LET'S START A RIOT
I'm ashamed I didn't see the post till I saw people talkin, I'm usually on it and unsurprisingly it's fire 🔥🔥
Let start a riot 🔥💯
LETS START A RIOT
LETS START A RIOT!!!!!!!!!
Straight fire!
LET'S START A RIOT!!!
FYI "Gumbo" - Adam Calhoun Ft. Demun Jones, Brodnax, Dusty Leigh is also out.. FIRE...
watching your writing skills just get better and better has been a fun ride to be on for the last three years and I can't decide which song is my favorite because SO many are truly amazing! My favorite artist is Cobain and you are up there with him in my opinion. Keep going, dude. The sky is the limit!
I would call that the “don’t hug me jacket”.
Allright, I've seen enough of your videos to point out the inalienable truth, that you need to do a 3 hour podcast/YouTube Sit Down, with Macklemore. Upvote this. DO THIS! And invite me. I'll fly wherever at any time. Two Kings 🤴
Let’s start a Riot y’all ❤️
Amazing graphics!!...tell Nova thank you for working with manuer to film this video, the fans appreciate it. #HOG #LetsStartARiot 🔥

Tom you are the GOAT. Nova you are the BEST. Jarrod you are a GREAT addition to the team..
The quality of Tom's videos always blows me away. Curious how many times him and Nova have repainted their livingroom 😆

Let's Start A Riot!
I'm sorry but I'm disappointed again, Tom. Your demeaning yourself and your legacy everytime you lower yourself to produce a song of this nature. Why do you care what anyone who doesn't care about you says? You say you don't care but the fact you keep making songs with this feel and message says otherwise. Actually its not necessarily the message so much as the way its delivered which just comes off as the distasteful unnecessary and in truth self diminishishing taunting of  an petulant petty adolescent poser with the emotional maturity of a 2 year old. It devalues you and the rest of your works. You are better than this Tom and you don't have to point it out. It is self evident enough for those with the eyes, ears, and mind to perceive it. Those who can't won't be changed nor even affected by your barbed words. They are mostly too dumb or blind to be. I hope that is out of your system sooner than later for yours and the sake of those around you for you whom are already enjoying the benefits of your success will find greater benefits when it's for something more meaningful you do the work for. Much love and respect. Please don't let your initial emotional response keep you from really considering these things I've cared enough about who you are as a person and your emotional well being though we've never met to mention now a couple of times. You may be a rebellious,  confrontational, never hold back kind of @$$#0\_€ but those are some of the traits of most archetypal heroes also. One very common one I didn't mention is a humble self image. Confidence is useful and productive always. Cocky can be useful and productive but it can also be the root of your own self destruction. It can be overcompensation for your self doubt or it can be that your too dumb to know better but anyone who knows your feet don't fit in clown shoes even when your clowning knows it's not that second possibility. Idk, like I said we have never met so I can't make a knowledgeable assessment. It's just the perspective of an outsider sharing the bad taste this left in my mouth. I wish the best for you and yours. I know you will find your way without help from the likes of me. We are born into this world knowing how to love unconditionally. Kids don't need to learn to be more grown up. Grown ups need to remember how to be a kid when it comes to certain things. Peace

Something is off with this clip. Maybe too much VFX? I don't know but is more to I don't like it side of things. I liked more the videos made before with none or minimal vfx), it was more real feeling than this.

A++ for dropping Metal on the strings.  Ayreon would approve :-)  Fyi, Your natural vibe needs no autotune :-)
Let's start a riot !
You're the only one who I listen to. I'm 13 years old and I love listen   you're the only rapper I listen to. Oh yeah, and I love all your stuff, oh, yeah, and I make drawings show. If you want me to draw, you can. Oh, yeah, and I make my own songs too, but they're not out yet. I wish I was in one of your videos. I would draw you right now,
love this track  just jen react recommend   it would be insane levels of cool if you messaged her to tell her how cool she is  pretty sure she would do a backflip  will leave it with you   but just 1 final thought  had she not reviewed your track soz but i would never have found you its the danger when infinite content is available how to find good sh1t jen dud that for me and i assume many many others   ty just jen reacts

Love this !
Let's start a riot ❤️🔥
I support what you're trying to do, but like Tim Pool your material just isn't my jam at the moment. Honest criticism incoming, it's all too damn political and people just want to party and have fun when listening to music. Try something a little more apolitical for a moment and see what happens, the mainstream would 100% have to address it like Pool's current work.
Let's start a riot!
Love the track

Hey Tom try to do another good beat like your earlier song, "Bad News". It had a good rythm to it. Switch it back up again. It would be a good hit for ya.
Let's start a riot ❤️🔥
**"LET'S START A RIOT!"**
LET'S START A RIOT! BUY THE ITUNES VERSION!
Oh, look. Another independent rapper talking trash about everyone but himself. How... unique. You've become the very thing you were endeavoring to destroy. Used to be a big fan, Tom, but good grief. I may be in the minority on your channel, but I can't stomach your childishness anymore. Peace.
This is badass, love the metal style guitar. Shout out @timpoole, shits a banger

Tom, as much as I love your politically themed songs I live more that you still stay true to yourself with your songs as well. When we try to hard to appease the masses we loose a part of ourselves. Much love & respect from Washington state!
Won't be long till Tom owns the culture.
Your music has struck a cord with me Tom, you are a lyrical genius
LETS START A RIOT
I'm trying to watch the video right now on YT and there is no sound. This has never happened before, am I the only one that's experiencing this problem?
The song is dope Tom! Love it!
🔥
I agree with you politically Tom, but I’m not feeling this.  There was a moment of… rage in your voice that grabbed my attention, but then you went flat-safe again and lost me all over again.  Politics is not enough.  I need to be able feel music, and have it propel me through whatever my day has in store.
Please Go riot on Ma Songs.💪🏼🤍
Let's start a riot
🔥
Let's start a riot! I love this fucking song, Tom. It's such a banger, I can't believe people are still sleeping on you. You're such an inspiration.🥺🐐 Also, the sooner people realize that you're not just a "political" rapper the better off you'll be. Maybe this will help to weed out some fake fans. Keep bringing the bangers, I'm here for all of them. Also, Nova and Jared with the cinematography and VFX *chef's kiss*. I see you, too, Evan Morgan with the M&M. 🔥 TEAM

Well hell bells... let's start a riot !!!
Fun fact: that mound of bones is made up of a wooden box that Tom built that is surrounded with cinder blocks and those cinderblocks are filled with waterproof paper and covered with canned spray insulation foam. Then Tom spray painted that mound of foam over the cinderblocks with black spray paint and that was covered with topsoil which surprisingly was mostly manure lol 😂. Then over top of that they placed animal and human bones that they had purchased and were stained by Tom’s sister to look real. Tom’s brother-in-law did the CGI effects. Tom was just on the side of his patio there in front of a 20 foot green screen that he built and painted then his brother-in-law added the special effects!! Is this not the absolute best team of people you could ever think of???
Please do more of the the guitar rifts....  #let's start a riot

Bro..  Seriously.. I LOVE YOU / YOUR Message... But, you need to evolve tone, message and music.. Sounds redundant...  I'll take you over punk arse Eminem, as a human, and especially an artist with ballz..  However, you need to EVOLVE...  STAY "Independent", thou you aren't, outside of being a slave to the 'Labels'...   YOU do NOT owe anyone the talk about that topic..  Leave it behind.. Keep GROWING..  Too many artists get stuck in the mud..  No doubt YOU, Nova, your crew and a few others have created an AWESOME brand, almost always outside of the norms..  Just don't "lose yourself" (yeah - butch much deeper) by stifling yourselves...  Just those 2 pennies..
Hey Tom, Grateful K9 would love to provide you with a Personal Protection Dog, or even just with a K-9 Security Team when needed. On the house. We support you and what you do. Hit us up!
Let’s start a RIOT….a RIOT!!

I would rather watch Tom MacDonald rap on videos and on pandora while around my kids. Because he speaks the truths of the world and people get riled about him speaking the truth. He is awesome and my whole family loves his music. My husband who hates rap music  blares his songs. Love love love this new song.
Shutdown amp good shit
Who the eff is Tom McDonald and why can't I stop watching his videos.  I feel like I've been living in a cave and I've discovered something everybody has known about for years. Thanks, YouTube algorithm?
Yeah we do need to start riots against the elite! Why we so quiet!  Let's do more! Shoe them what we got!

Hey Tom . Not going to lie .... Besides marshalls beat , this is your illest beat , and you killed it . Straight fire , my harshest comment would be that your other songs now  feel a little forced compared to this. Beat 🔥 video (nova) 🔥 flow 🔥 you let the best breath at all the right times , I pray others will feel the same and bump this on replay daily. "Put you 6 feet deep that's an underground rapper" instant classic!! Great job and keep it up!!

Nova is making some BAD ASS videos!!
christians how u feel now
How many times can he kill it? Infinitely....
SIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICK!!!!!!!!!!
If Tom McDonald ever did a tour I'd definitely buy tickets
Tom, please listen! I love all of your music and u have made me a better father, husband and a better person in general. I understand that you are underground and make stabs at the main stream. In my eyes and another 4 million peoples eyes, YOU ARE MAIN STREAM. you make music for the underdogs and you give motivation to us to better ourselves. A lot of your fans listen to you because they can relate to your past such as myself. "Scars, church, withdrawals, and my wife's favorite..bad news" man, you are so talented and you are better than rubbing it in main streams face. You are the most humblest and real dude out there. DONT LOSE YOURSELF TOM!!!! WE ALL COUNT ON YOU AND CARE ABOUT YOU! Just be you brother and do what u do best. Fuck main stream, you are  main stream and you're on top already. Love you brother, be you. Peace.
Here from Timcast, not my kind of music, but I want to at least give you my view.
so sick.  one of the best yet, and the last were outstanding.
One more time: the future of our country depends on artists like you.  Just found you and, as an old, old man, I am in awe of your impact.  DO. NOT. STOP.  Our America's independence depends on patriots like you to maintain the sanctity of our beloved Constitution.
Tom MacDonald: I hate pop  Also Tom MacDonald: I’m a popstar
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."     -John 3:16 God gave us his only son Jesus Christ who Lived a sinless Life then died on the cross to endure our punishment, he rose again on the 3rd day and is currently seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty.   We have all sinned against the Perfect and Holy God that gave us Life, we all deserve the Punishment of Hell for our sin/rebellion against him.  We have all Broken the Moral Law in our Hearts, even if you don't believe in Jesus, or have never heard of him or the Law of Moses or the Bible, you are still sinful and on your way to Hell. But the GOOD News is that Jesus Christ took our sin upon himself by being Crucified and shed his Blood as payment for our Sins.   He took our Punishment and gave us his reward of Eternal Life in Heaven  Jesus is returning to Judge the world soon my Friends Please Repent and believe in his sacrifice and Love for you, believe in him as your Lord and Saviour, and you shall be saved.  May God Bless you all! ♥️
Killing it bro 🙌🏽
Tom. A legend. An outsider. An inspiration. A rapper. Independent. Unfiltered. Un-Woke. Awake. Above all else, he is Tom.
Viva Tom 🤟
He looks more like an orc than the ones in the new LOTR

I am generally sympathetic but these song themes are formulaic and repetitive to me, who has been listening a long time. I don't need to hear Tucker Carlson rap. I get capitalizing on a niche but where are the songs like Castles and I Wish?
LET'S START A RIOT 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
let's start a RIOT!!!!!
Fire 🔥
If I were to have a son 👇👇👇 I would be so proud if he were identical to Thomas   Aside from his song genius....his heart is golden. 💛💛💛💛💛  H.O.G. Fam forever 🤗❣️🤗  #RIOT

Youtube is Stealing it from Tom; The # hasn't moved all day.  Lets Riot For This.
Tom, this was different!!!
It's Riot time!
Your Hero's Journey is not yet complete, Tom. This story arc ends at the destruction of the evil industry that tried to destroy you.   It is a metaphor for where we are all at, socially, economically and politically.  It's our story arc, too.
🔥 🔥 🔥
I like the new song ☺️
Music is poetic as always!
Hell yea! Nuff said.
My wife and I wish could have way to had tom and nova at our wedding when we got married bc listening to Tom music every Friday been our thing since introduced her to his music. She sings along every song. Nothing like hard work Tom n nova put out their whole careers
Let's start a riot!
Lets start a Riot!!!!
They should be afraid now.... "drawin' blood and ain't talking bout red crayons"!!! GOOOOO TOM!
Every since I started listening to you around a year or two ago, I have loved the music. Keep it up lets start a riot
Awesome!
Not bad. Who is the target? No name drops. Wrong answers only.
They must dynamic rapper in the industry!!! He uses his platform to speak for those of us who do not have a voice!!!!!! I hope Tom will call out the hypocrisy going on today with Biden vs Trump.

Riot time baby! Lets gooo
I've been watching you for a minute on YouTube and honestly I got to say you are highly talented person and this is just a suggestion but you should start your own record label and change the industry or at least do it differently than them there's a lot of people out there that got talent and they don't touch them with a 10-ft pole because they don't fit into the mold.  Like I said just a suggestion.
I wish to see you in real life I love your songs and my dad does too
new GFBF song when? Love the vedio, and I normal love the lyrical bars you have this just felt empty vs what you normaly do it mite just not be my taste this time but will still like 100%
The Cinematography is Beyond! Song is ok, I liked Scars and Names better, but they all can't be gems. Song was good but not great, Video was next level. Just my honest opinion. #Forever Hog
Please look up Camarillo state hospital unit 42 the thousands of children that went through there since 1958 the year I was born and I got there in 1969 67 for the first time my picture will be there:-) factual statement.! :-)
A small challenge for you young man I'm 64 my eyes are exactly is your eyes are the problem is I am truly a monster and you are not you are good person. Just an old cowboy saying hi. Thank you sir.:-)

Ok... While I am a TomMac fan to the death, this was a weird ass flow, dawg... Short and repetitive too. This kinda felt like 80% of the effort went into the video production. Just some constructive criticism brobro, can't wait for the next one 🤙

Good song. Ty again TM
Tom Macdonald is the shit! Keep telling truth brotha! 45 years old jam u everyday on way to work and home. WWG1WGA
You’re not God. Only fools cry and riot around you. You’re not of God and it shows. You pander to liberals, democrats, homosexuals, YouTube, social and music platforms. You don’t speak truth to the people. You fill their heads with garbage and drama. Clearly you never got rid of that upside down cross on your neck either. Tells everything we need to know about you. You only attract lost souls and fools and ungodly individuals. Your music isn’t appealing. Repent and do something for God and share his word for all to hear.
Nova great job on the visual!
Awesome song you are blessed!
Let's Start a Riot

My personal opinion to this video and track I gave up rap for the very reasons Tom and everyone speaks about @Tom MacDonald never stop your independents they will come for you they will try to get you to sign they will try everything but if you do, please do it on your terms   and as far as this track and video go good job! I'm a supporter ✌❤🙏
@Tom MacDonald this IS AMAZING 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌💯💯💯💯💯💪💪💪💪🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐❤️❤️❤️❤️🎤🎤🎤👑👑👑

Dope as fuck. Visuals are absolutely amazing.
LET'S START A RIOT
With the graphics skulls and the lighting storm it's the perfect Riot
LET'S START A RIOT
Gotta be honest with you. I HATE RAP.!  I am a Metalhead through and through.  That said, I have to ask myself a question- " Why can I not stop listening to and watching your Videos?" Then I realized why. It's because there is NO denying that you spit absolute 🔥🔥🔥! I have NEVER been impressed by a rapper before, but YOU are the MAN! GREAT JOB! Don't give up. If you can get into MY Head with your Music, you will accomplish great things in the future. Much RESPECT to you Tom.
Let's start a riot!💯👋🏻💯👋🏻 #TomMacDonald #hangovergang
Keep blasting the industry that needs dismantled  It’s old school and needs dismantled  Tom dismantle it song by song F them!!!

Let's start a riot
It’s 🔥! But I’m trying to figure out who he is aiming at. Game? I saw a couple independent cornballs dissing him but I doubt he’s talking about them and they’re not even close to his level but he did say you gotta have a career to be a has been in some words. Keep up the great work!!!!!
Best production so far! Audio and visuals are 100

In a unbroken string of raw undeniable "here, is some truth to chew on", so you can grow up to be an honest (to yourself) warrior in the eternal? battle to hold the corruptors of truth and life at bay. Thank you . Once again, you have given of yourself, to give to others who are WILLING to see the truth for themselves, that gift of an example of how to live up to , and refuse to give in to the fear of facing the darkness and chaos that the manipulators of reality use to confuse and sidetrack any that risk the repercussions of refusing  to step away from defense of the weak and vulnerable the predators need to prey on to feed their hunger for more power to fuel their insatiable drive to selfishly possess every ones ability too seek their pursuit of the mystical  and  magical freedom promised and produced from the so called " inalienable pursuit of life liberty and pursuit of happiness" that the writing that gave birth to this uniquely singular entity The United States of America. My apologies for the seeming verbosity of this comment. But I assure you that is not the truth nor intent in these words. This is not about hey look at me.... I don't give a fuck what your opinion of me is. It is irrelevant. This is about Hey you need to look at you. COMPLACENCY will doom us all. Do not believe me. I challenge you  to risk opening your eyes and find the facts to me prove my so called Conspiracy theory wrong. Please !!! By the way it's not about who wins or loses it's about finding the strength to seek the truth for yourself. If you have begun this process or have completed this process and you are ready to negate my words with your findings. Congratulations now you know how it's done .You are already a(not the) winner.......Your welcome. Now find your way to pass it on. Welcome to the War friend. Now maybe you can assimilate and understand the gift Tom Macdonald has been trying to give us all.
Awesome love it. Let’s start a riot

Amazing!
Incredible job on the production & visuals. Also, this hook is so catchy. It's been stuck in my head since you dropped. Killed this one in every way! So much attention to detail with the visuals & production. Production mimicking the lyrics & visuals dropping as soon as the beat drops. Love it! Praying for your family & Nova!! 💜

Good content and on point Tom.  Bought it on iTunes’ to support you. Love to see something like “Ashes” along the theme of, liberty waisted, if you can dig it.  Coincidentally, if things continue as they are for both Canada & USA, sadly,,,it could most likely come to pass.
I'll be bumpin this one alot for sure ,we dig it

Tom Macdonald- MAKING STRAIGHT WHITE GUYS COOL AGAIN !!!

I honestly can't fathom how HOG makes this level of production whilst being independent. Props to the whole team!
Don’t care for this music - but I purchased this song on Itunes in support. 👊🏽👽👍🏽

Nova out did herself on this one. Good Job Tom. The vid is 🔥
When he actually makes songs without hashtag trends his songs are even more cringe 🤣😂

Love it man. Keep it up
Imagine as little seed u are growing and becoming what God wants u to Become trust in God and accept Jesus as your Lord and savior ur choice Jesus takes u to a way to find God by having a relationship with Christ and God. You will know them if u follow God and have a relationship with him God is creations of all creations. We might make mistakes and not obey him but we’re not perfect that’s why For God so love the world he gave his only begotten son name Jesus that who so ever believe in him shall not perish but have everlasting life Commit to Christ before it’s to late accept Jesus into your life to have a relationship with God For Jesus answered and says I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the father (which is God)except through me ur choice no pressure Commit to Christ accept Jesus as your lord and savior have an relationship with God ask for forgiveness for if we confess are sins he is just and faithful and cleanse us from unrighteousness love y’all God bless yal

Shots fired, boom boom, the 💣 bomb ! 🍃 six feet deep that’s a underground rapper no paper chaser no more receipts stashed later. No need to slap what’s left. It’s best left unsaid, all right no need to bleed or fight , hun pulls out the gun singing “sing it again, ain’t no fun” get that hair out the bun, reggae music , too dope music , people use it to fix the internet and heal their minds, come on people wake up you’re behind the times. Much love to Tom And Super Nova May god bless you and family more in every way, today. ❤️💜🧡🖤🤍💛🤎💚💙💔💞💕❣️❤️‍🩹❤️‍🔥💓💗💖💘💝✝️☮️💟✡️☪️🔯🛐☦️🆔♐️♋️♍️☢️🉑📳📴🈸

Holy Hell...
What the fuck is this garbage
This was a genuine flex to all the lil rappers out there sniveling taking shots at him. A riot indicates it’s to everyone, not just one person. All of them will think he’s talking about them. He’s literally the only one on the true independent Mount Rushmore. He’s literally saying “I’m the only one”
Wow. Just wow. Would love to see ‘how we made this video.’ Truly incredible. I appreciate you so much. They love to riot don’t they?
LET’S START A MF RIOTTT!!! I just recently found out about him on TikTok. I wish I could’ve known sooner. His music has helped me through so much. I don’t know if that’s cliche to say but I never understood what was happening until I see and listen to Tom  Macdonald. I am now a huge fan of him and Nova and their music. I love it, I live for it. Have not true to myself, he has helped me be more confident in myself. I am an Asian American and now I am not afraid anymore.
Never give up your work. It is great. Thank you

1.1 mil views  in less than a whole day from being released. I love the traction the Mac is getting. Sir as I say on most videos  your message is clear and inspiring. Your craft is of genius level. Keep up the effort it's catching on like  "pop"  in low blood sugar.  Also a shout out to your production crew they make the Mac shine everytime.

hi
Let's start a riot!
Let's start a riot
You never cease to amaze me bro!! Been a huge fan and watched you blow up and I’m hyped!! I’m an aspiring artist myself and your fearlessness of the system is awe inspiring bro much love!!
And that's how you hijack a culture...
Hey lets start a Riot bro!
THE GOSPEL OF SALVATION ✝️  Jesus Christ died on the Cross for your sins he shedded his blood for you. But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and by his stripes we are healed. Christ Jesus took the punishment we 100% deserved He died on the cross shedding his blood for you and he (Christ Jesus) was buried and here is the best part he(Christ Jesus)rose from the grave 3 days later defeating death and proved that everything that he(Christ Jesus) said is true and Christ Jesus ascended up to Heaven and is now at the right hand of the father.  The Gospel for the New Testament Church is 1 Cor. 15: 1-4 KJV and Romans 3: 25 KJV explains it even further. It's what Christ Jesus did for us that we're saved and it's by faith alone, not works. We're forgiven for all sins by Christ's shed blood. According to the Bible unlike what other Christians be teaching salvation is by receiving (BY FAITH!!) what Christ Jesus DID on the cross at Calvary, when  HE(Christ Jesus) shed his BLOOD to pay for the sins of man. HIS FINISHED WORK, done ONCE AND FOR ALL, is the ONLY THING that can save a Sinner and give him forgiveness of sins and eternal life.  NOTE: "according to the scriptures" (1 Cor 15:3) means it was preached before hand in the word of God. Other versus reinforcing your Salvation by the Gospel. Rom 1:16 (Salvation?!?! who wrote Romans??? Rom 2:16 (God will judge by who's Gospel??) 1 Cor 1:17; (No baptism, just faith in the Gospel!) 2 Cor 4:3-4 (Those who don't understand are??) Gal 1: 6-9; (Preach no other Gospel please!!) Eph 1:13; (Sealed with the Holy Spirit when???) Eph 3:1-7 (How are the Gentiles Heirs??) 1 Thess 4:14 (There goes that Gospel again!) 2 Thess 1:6-8 (Scary if you don't believe!!!) EVERY WRITER of these books are Paul aka Saul (Acts 13:9). He's going through each city, as the Holy Spirit leads him (Acts 13:2), to preach the message or the Gospel because God commissioned Paul in Acts that he would bear Jesus name to the Gentiles (Acts 9:15; 26:14-18). The Gospel or the Good News is that Christ is not dead as everyone thought, but His death was accomplished to actually save us from our sins and by Him being raised from the dead, He now lives and we can be confident we will live too because we're sealed with the Holy Spirit (Rom 8:11; Eph 1:13 ). isn't that GOOD NEWS???  The difference in Paul's gospel from Jesus's gospel was that Jesus's gospel preached: believe that I am the Son of God (Matt 16:16-17;John 3:16; 6:69;11:27) repent and prepare for the kingdom of God. Jesus has not died yet, so they couldn't believe in His death, burial, and resurrection-nor did any of his disciples understand when He told them (Luke 18:31-33). Any follower or disciple of Jesus simply had to only believe who Jesus, repent or turn away from their sins and prepare themselves because the kingdom of God was at hand (Mark 1:14-15). Don't believe the words I tell you, but read and believe Christ as my personal Lord and Savior is neglecting that Christ died on the cross for you. By believing in the gospel, your now placed in the body of Christ, which Christ is the head and "Lord" over (Romans 14:9). In addition, because of Christ's Death, burial, and resurrection--God the Father gave Christ all authority (or LORD) over all things (Matt28:18; Phil 2:8-11). He is NOW your "SAVIOR" because He died for your sins and saved you from external punishment and death.  Notice that the Gospel is what JESUS DID FOR MAN, and not what MAN CAN DO FOR GOD! A person is only saved by BELIEVING in the finished work of Jesus Christ, when he shed his Precious Blood for our sins. This blood atonement was necessary, for without shedding of blood, there is no remission (Heb. 9:22). God has always demanded blood for sin. WITHOUT SHEDDING OF BLOOD THERE IS NO REMISSION OF SINS!! In the Old Testament, God accepted the blood of a lamb. In the New Testament, God accepts the shed blood of Jesus Christ, the LAMB OF GOD, slain for your sins.  Now, to be saved, the Bible clearly teaches us that salvation is by FAITH, without WORKS (Eph. 2:8-9). Faith in what you may ask? FAITH IN THAT SHED BLOOD OF CHRIST JESUS! Romans 3:25-28 makes this very clear:  Romans 3:25-28 King James Version 25 Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God: 26 To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus. 27 Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith. 28 Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.  BE CAREFUL OF PEOPLE TRYING TO TELL YOU that it's what you do or that you gotta work for your salvation IGNORE AND WALK AWAY BECAUSE THEY DO NOT KNOW THE TRUTH READ ROMANS CHAPTERS 3-6. We are not saved by repenting (turning from sin), being baptized in water, walking an aisle, saying a prayer, confessing with your mouth, being "born again" or following Jesus' earthly ministry. Those are all "works" salvation.  We are saved by grace not works (Rom 11:6), through faith alone, in Christ work on the cross. It is a gift 100%. Eph 2:8-9; Titus 3:5-6, I Cor 15:1-4 Romans 5:8 He(Christ Jesus) came to save sinners, not people trying to make themselves righteous by doing some kind of good work or turning from their sins, they can't that do anyway.  Simply believe and put your trust in the gospel Paul gave us from Jesus. Then start reading Romans- Philemon to understand what was written to us the body of Christ, so we could know what God wants from us and who we are in Christ, once we are saved. The books Paul wrote are the onlv place we find the gospel that saves us today. Then read the rest of your bible that is for us but not to and about us. 94% of the bible is to and about Israel. Don't steal their mail and try to make it yours. And DO NOT BE FOOLED BY PEOPLE WHO TELL YOU, YOU NEED TO DO SOME WORK TO BE SAVED OR TO STAY SAVED!!! That is not the gospel for us today which is a free gift of GRACE when we believe. Eph 2:8-9  Follow and read the versus's and let God guide you to victory. Remember to TEST ALL THINGS (INCLUDING MYSELF) and hold on to that which is true (1 John 4:1; 1 Thess 5:21 ). If these scriptures about salvation are contradicting what you heard before in your church, from your pastor, teacher, or from whomever then that's your cue to Research.Research.Research…Research by COMPARING SCRIPTURE with SCRIPTURE!!! Let God be true and every man a liar (Rom 3:4). That goes for any person or anyone who teaches you scriptures, hear them with all readiness, but don't set your heart on it until you search and read the scriptures for yourself (Acts 17:11).DON'T PLAY GAMES WHEN IT COME TO ETERNAL LIFE!! Each person is going to be responsible to God in judgment and all excuses will be eliminated including: this person told me this and this person told me that, the preacher told me this and a teacher told me that…You are responsible to God to work out your own salvation (Phil 2:12 )!!! We all have the bible to search the scriptures. If you need help, then pray to God for understanding (James 1:5; Proverbs 2:6). It's His book and His words, who other than to pray to for understanding????? Once you get that understanding, then set your heart on that which is true by believing that Christ died for your sins, and He was buried, and rose again the 3rd day (1 Cor 15:1-4). Your salvation will be secure and we will meet in heaven and rejoice together for your faith in the Gospel whomever you are!  So basically what I'm saying is in order to truly be saved, a person's faith must be wholly in the shed blood of Jesus Christ. Not our works BUT IN THE FINISHED WORK OF THE LORD CHRIST JESUS THE SHEDDING OF HIS BLOOD!! This declares God the Just one. When a sinner is saved, he cannot and will not ever boast about himself or his works. He'll only brag upon Jesus Christ who saved him from his sins and especially from hell!!!  1 Corinthians 15:1-4 King James Version 15 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:  Hebrews 9:22 King James Version 22 And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.  Ephesians 2:8-9 King James Version 8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: 9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.  Romans 5:8 King James Version 8 But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.  Romans 6:23 King James Version 23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.  Romans 10:9-11 King James Version 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. 10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 11 For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed,  John 3:16 King James Version 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life  Please take your time to watch this 15 or 1 hour video I'll pray that you will  https://youtu.be/lbb4xwYj19g ( 15 min short video ❤️)  https://youtu.be/qJT7RbMGGJw ( 1 hour video❤️)

Straight up, I can't stand new rap. I actually like your music though and it's not about sex and drugs for once, that gets old quick when EVERY song is the same. Calling out the crazy running this world without holding back too much, keep it up and don't pull an Eminem please! I'm actually subscribing to a rapper, this is so weird to me..
Let’s start a riot! The guitar riffs between versus blew my freaking mind! Keep up the good work Tom and keep dropping those hits!

You're amazing artist that speaks the woke truth  unfortunately I'm just not feeling or vibing this one the song got that mumble rap thing going on. The song is probably great I just hate mumble rap.  I'm just old school i like woke rap  Like you & webbie and what you both represent and I like the Wu-Tang style  Cypress Hill m&m besties boys the fat boys Yello wolf  Music with a message & a story  Like most of the music that you have put out.

Not a hater I truly like toms earlier stuff, just don’t hold the expectations anymore…. I think there’s more song I dislike than like, but the ones I do like wow they are good. This one is not one i care for. I’m totally on the lazo and burden trains!

Only ONE problem: It ENDED (too soon)😭  One of THE best hooks out of all of his songs! 🔥🔥🔥 Can't get it out of my head and I relate so much to those few - but powerful words. ❤️‍🔥  (A lot of little sneaky snarks were dropped in those bars - not sure many picked up on them - and they were great 😘😅🙃)
Let’s start a RIOT❤️‍🔥
By far and away his best song yet. The beat is awesome and the crickets is best sound effect to a song. Nova killed it and of course Tom owns Friday.
Shout out to NOVA...damn good. Unbelievable. Wow factor girl!!! Another masterpiece you too.
Why so quiet 🤫 🦗 🦗 🦗 💀🤷🏼‍♀️, I love it 😂  let’s start a riot 😎🔥

Tom, as much as I love your politically themed songs I live more that you still stay true to yourself with your songs as well. When we try to hard to appease the masses we loose a part of ourselves. Much love & respect from Washington state! 🥰
Imagine what the song will be like that will introduce the next album !!

Top 10 Of The World's Funniest One Liners!  1. Ninety-nine percent of lawyers give the rest a bad name. 2. Few women admit their age; few men act it. 3. If we aren’t supposed to eat animals, why are they made with meat? 4. Why is "abbreviation" such a long word? 5. Nuke the Whales. 6. You can't have everything; where would you put it? 7. I took an IQ test and the results were negative. 8. Nothing is fool proof to a sufficiently talented fool.  9. On the other hand, you have different fingers. 10. The more people I meet, the more I like my dog.   Editorial: Maybe the world's most thought-provoking one-liner is "Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit needgod.com

First time I heard it, wasn't sure. It was so different, it threw me. But listened again and loved it. Watched a bunch of reactors and loved it more each time I heard it. Loved hearing the backstory about how you built the set and can't wait to see the BTS. You and Nova are so freaking creative in all you do. Fan for life. Already bought the song. Hope everyone does because it's definitely worth it.

The upside cross on your face at :24 was a slap to mine. Didn't think you got down like that. Oh well. Fool me once (autographed CD's purely for support cause who owns a fucking cd player) shame on me. I see you. Thought it to be a possibility but sluffed it off. That was pretty blatant. Guess I should've listened to my gut. If I'm right, the lack of creativity with this one will repeat over and over and over and over. Your fridays have been replaced with repeats from anybody. I'll start with Tyson James. He spits real. And them autographed CD's. REMIX!!! "Pissin on fake sales is just another weekend"

Tom, I've been wondering something.  On the occasional videos where Nova colabs with another producer, is it always for the special effects?  Are there other reasons you bring them in?

Well Tom when you shower the darkness with light and the truth is revealed and shadows have nowhere to run. You most likely will become their target. However that light also reveals your allies. Phenomenal job on the video by the way, the representation and imagery is awesome. The graphics and effects were definitely next level. Shout out to Nova and all those who support your independent endeavor.
Let’s start a riot

Good enough I guess
my dear Canadian brother, can't wait for you to voice the downfall of our beloved country with this tyran Trudeau. LOVE your music and lyrics, you are insanely talented, and your girlfriend is so talented with the production of these videos. Keep it real, a lot of us are behind you and supporting you.
Definitely feeling this one.  Love the cadence AND the hook!
I really do respect Tom’s game, but can we please stop having this big dramatic pause of the beat, in every single song, just before the hook comes in? It’s in every TM song over the last 2 years I think
Great song
Sounds awesome
Cringe 😬
A 10/10. 👌👌👌👌❤️❤️❤️❤️
Do you have the ‘n’ word pass?
Let's start a Riot
LET'S START A RIOT
This song and video blew me away.I have listened to this on repeat so many times! Amazing Tom fucking amazing. Video is wild!
Great song
Tom McDonald is a beast!! This one is 🔥🔥🔥🔥!!
epic
auto tune trash. The worst song in years.
I doubt you’ll see this, Tom.  But do you plan on making a music video for “Soldier”.  Awesome song and people would eat up a video for it
Another winner Tom! Congrats!
I love this guy. For being (I don’t mean this offensively) a tattooed pierced trailer park trash kid, he has lifted himself up and become something astonishingly talented. This may be the first time in my life that I hope kids look up to a rapper. Keep it up Tom you are killing it.
Hmm 🤔  the beat is nice,  your definitely expressing your self. Don't let anyone bring you down.
I WILL BE LISTENING TO TOM MCDONALD TILL I'M A GHOST ON CRIPPLE....
Once again a great one !!! Nova and crew out did themselves. Killer Vid and great tune
IV BEEN  WAITING  ON HIM TO DO SOME ANGY SHIT WITH DISTORTED  GUITAR  ..MORE PLEASE  GO HARDER 🎸🎸🎸
💪💪💪❤
Awesome
That was awesome! I'm gonna watch it again! Love the lyrics and the beat!
Video is perfect as always
Song sucks bro. Put your ego away.
Tom has lots of good songs, but this isn't one of em.
Why the Fuck So Quiet!..
I'm banging this out I'm my truck right now ya ya eeee
This gives me the vibes of 90s rap/Lincoln Park with a modern vibe I love it! Thank you for fighting and helping us feel not alone! Hang over gang!

Tom is a beast
Nice song man
Amazing video man! Tom never disappoints!

Great song, as always
Tom several things 1st and foremost, your music speaks truth and do NOT stop what you are doing dude 2nd imma buy this song to help fight the oppression of anti Corp artists but it is not my favorites of yours (tops being brainwashed, fake woke, and white boy) 3rd Tim Pool sent me go hang on his show please 4th in general this genre isn't my tops with my main genre including Sabaton and Manowar. But you are epic none the less so again please keep it up!
Why so quite!? Start a RIOT!!
Youtube never gave me a notification when this Premiered. Still I'm here now and I'm sharing this I'm on my death bed.

It’s cool. I like your antiestablishment tracks better though.
Living right has it's rewards.
man why you are investing so much for the video! i like more just you paint face that’s more special diffraction just saying
Hey yo Tom, Tim Look has been shouting you out non-stop for the last 24 hours. Can we get you and Nova on a Timcast IRL episode please? We all know Tim would make that happen in a second.
Till You a Ghost Bro?? Really.. the hill grass better. Kill forever on that if u prefer dirt under.. Lol he is still the biggest..
♥️♥️♥️🔥
Sounds good
Just heard about Tom from Tim Pool on Timcast IRL. I can't believe I haven't seen or heard your music. It's amazing! But your message! Wow.... love it! Keep up the amazing work, fighting the establishment and sending a message in your own way!

Let’s start a riot!!!
Tom, you just got a shoutout on #TimcastIRL
Discovered you're music a few months ago. I've heard truth bombs dropped in rap before but what you drop is danger close for sure. You're a great artist.
The bone tornado was awesome!
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."     -John 3:16 God gave us his only son Jesus Christ who Lived a sinless Life then died on the cross to endure our punishment, he rose again on the 3rd day and is currently seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty.   We have all sinned against the Perfect and Holy God that gave us Life, we all deserve the Punishment of Hell for our sin/rebellion against him.  We have all Broken the Moral Law in our Hearts, even if you don't believe in Jesus, or have never heard of him or the Law of Moses or the Bible, you are still sinful and on your way to Hell. But the GOOD News is that Jesus Christ took our sin upon himself by being Crucified and shed his Blood as payment for our Sins.   He took our Punishment and gave us his reward of Eternal Life in Heaven  Jesus is returning to Judge the world soon my Friends Please Repent and believe in his sacrifice and Love for you, believe in him as your Lord and Saviour, and you shall be saved.   May God Bless you all!!
Let's RIOT!!
Cringelord
Rock or rap? Love it
I just gave this a like before the song even started.
Let’s start a riot!
So I know most people won’t like this but my 8 year old granddaughter loves you and your music. It’s crazy because she doesn’t cuss ever   But she asked me if it was ok to like Tom Macdonald instead of another artist I also like. I said of course and I asked her why she likes you and she said he just sings about facts. The others sing about dumb stuff.
dam Tom out here continually makin waves and droppin bangerzzzz
Let’s start a riot!!!!!

how did he/nova do the floating skulls?
Bro’s the real shit. Has been since day one, but now it’s becoming noticeable from all the industry

GET WOKE GO BROKE
Is this a Kanye diss
Destroy genres and break expectations 😎💯🔥
🔥 🖤Let's start a Riot 🖤 🔥
🔥
You dropped 4 songs since the brave was released, if I'm remembering correct you usually do 3 plus one after release per album. Is it safe to assume we're getting another double drop like, Us against the world and No guts, No glory? I'm pre-ordering either way, I just noticed that there was an extra song/video. The songs that have been released are triple fire 🔥🔥🔥 same as this one so if there is 2 albums they're going be the dopest yet and I can't wait for em.
hey Tom is there any chance of you putting your music on Bandcamp app?
😀😀😀
We need more bangers like this nowadays
How did you train the crickets to jump in on beat?
Let's start a Riot!
Sick beat! I love the rock feel that you put in this song and, of course, the video looks amazing. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Tom, I'm a 76 year old former bugel champion and your message has led me to accept my love for BlackMetal and marijuana use. Thank you for all that you do🤘

Now that's a Music video right there🔥🔥🔥💯
I love this, great sound and visuals!! Y'all killed it on this one. Y'all said "fuck the mark", and hit that shit a million times over it, seriously, next level shit!! I was pretty sad when it ended, I needed more. You two have grown so much as artists over the years, becoming, in my opinion, the power couple of music (while thankfully refusing to give in to the industry), just brilliant. Thanks for blessing us with this amazing work of art. I love all your music btw, but this one just hit different! ❤️
Legend.....hypermega
"No one knows your name that's why you always gotta name drop."
Love the song dude❤
Not my favorite Tom. I kinda went on the whole time waiting for it to pop free style. Maybe more guitar, waiting for the whole buildup to explode. Def a great video tho 👌 nova and you did great on the video but without it it's not really that good imo for me . Just me being honest just like on an older music video. But hey this one hits me about the same. This one's more for you than the rest of us. It's a victory walk one like the other. It's just not for me. But hey I love your art. Keep putting them out there bro. 💪I'm enjoying the ride. Def loved the video but lacking on the music side.

Riot time! 🔥🔥
This video is so beautifully done, my jaw dropped.  I'm totally digging the vibe. Another amazing song, so uniquely Tom.  #HogFam  ❤‍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤‍🔥
Certified banger.
Tom McDonald is the poster child for the dogs of Heaven. God’s Army. Heaven’s Raiders, ready to go to war for what’s right. Frontline soldiers for righteousness and what is good, pure and true. We are here, and damn it all of we’re getting more and more soldiers every day. “The only thing needed for evil to prevail is for good men to standby and do nothing”  We’re not standing there anymore. For my God, for my family, and for my Country and countrymen 🇺🇸
I like it allot .good song great video .
Love me some TOM!! Let’s start a riot! ❤️‍🔥
Amazing song and video on point.
Tom is greedy
LET'S START A RIOT!!!!! Absolutely amazing!!!🔥🔥🔥
Awesome production as always
Let's start a RIOT!!!
The crickets! JAJAJAJAJA
fire man fire
My critique, coming as a fan.   My honest take would be the video looks good, but the song's topic is a bit plain (we know you worked hard and you're great).  Maybe it's just me and personal taste. I like the faster and harder stuff with you attacking things bigger than fellow rappers.  So while the video I have no complaints about, song is way below average of what you usually do.  But nobody's perfect and like I said, could be only my tastes and others love the song.  More power to you. I'm still a fan.
Maybe suggest @MattMcGuire make a drum cover for this track?🥁🤔
We need more like Tom in the war against the fascists: Cancel culture, BLM, Wokeness and all the other cancer spreading all over the world. Nothing but fascism. They want to eradicate the white race. Saying the people that built this world has no culture. Lets fight back. History has shown its bad to poke the polar bear
Tom MacDonald is the better of the best no question!!
#HangoverGang
#Riot
#2 trending. People cant get enough TM.
Let's start a riot!! 🔥🔥
The videos effects was good but it went mumbled statice real quick kind of a flaunt of your current position in the industry kind of like a drake 69 attitude 🤣😂🤣😂
Yes
His music is "ok"... I want to like him, but nope... Just not my thing...
❤️
Let's start a Riot.

Independent G.O.A.T.
Best independent rapper in the last 20 years! 💯🔥
I'm 12 and this shit is amazing half my family love his music
This dude talks White but Sings like he is Black...Very Weird...Fraud Alert
🔥
One of my  reasons for loving your music and spirit, is because you refuse the industry of music. They ruin people and take true talent and corrupt it. Keep doing that, many of us appreciate truth is raw form. 😁 I will always be a hang over gang fan! 😁 ❤️ Much love to all of you!
Wow THAT sucked!
NOTHING BETTER THAN  A HOG RIOT YA’LL ✌️❤️🤘
HANG OVER GANG 4 LIFE
LOVE THIS!!
Still loving your music! Keep being great.
Damn Dawg...Nova puttin U over the top.  She's badass...yall bad ass. Keep it up. 💯 🔥
👏👏👏
Lyrics for the non native speakers please? Truly appreciated
Let’s start a RIOT!
Let’s start a riot
***LIKE THIS VID***
Choirs of agels hidden in the elements Your told their fallen by the Demiurge however there's been some recent developments  The god of the material realm is not the Father..A JEALOUS GOD!? ARE YOU STUPID!? THE RELIGION OF SCHIZOPHRENIC ABRAHAM? Dont bother.  You have to understand that fear is the only sin here and morality is the only way to power, or are you offering stones to your kids instead of bread cuz your a shitty father?  I believe in the one who can command control of me when I am fasted and I am pure I can look into your eyes and read your mind with unabusable power trusted manifested undeniably an offering of meat in place of a Stonesour  Quibble with names while the Father has no ears and then hide your one secret in your eyes, then seek validation for the false image you created and deceiving your concept of self with lies  For I tell you in truth that weight of your heart will be tested and weighed against a feather  Mine was lighter as it was weighed after my heart passed through baptism by fire so this is something you'll want to remember  Make sure when the time way your heart comes that all that's left of a once great muscle is just a smoldering ember.  You live in a conceptual place where David Icke is right...I hope your not so frail as to let that keep you up at night  Cuz once you get past the fact that you dont exist you'll find its easy to look at the script and foresee every coming plot twist  See I love your work Tom however there's just not another poet on the planet like me who can facilitate light upon darkness to illucidate and commemorate the greatness inside infectious enough to inundate a dinnerplate cuz I'm a Watcher like princess Di out running Papparzzi like a Kamikaze while I'm curb stomping Nazis in this remake of Happy Days where I'm Fonzy anf tour Pottsy  Now that the Queen is dead I AM the Lizard king so dont let it sting that I can also sing and fight like the devil as I AM reincarnation of Marduk the Sumerian God King (Completely on the level)  You see here I have all my credentials, OH my insurance!? I think I'm covered under acts of God from Prudential, unlimited potential, cuz the Father has messages he wants the world to hear.  Ahayaweh be praised and you are 2 master your fear☝🌠
Everything you release is great but I was expecting something controversial. Everyone knows you are the envied, uncancellable G.O.A.T. already, dude!
Let’s start a riot 🔥
U should one with eminem
🔥 preach it! Love it
last view was 925K, this view it went down to 923K.

Nova is the woman behind these videos and I’m always freaking impressed by how hard her skills go!   I don’t always listen to Tom’s music, but we have to support him to prove to the industry and nasty “freaky girl” Nickie that this is the message that needs to be rapped about.
LOVE THE SONG PLZ DO MORE MY GUY

Let's start a RIOT!

Just came here from your FB post. AMAZING!!!!👏 I'm so proud of you and nova!!! Theres no better duo!💜
We were amazed by this song and video. The visuals were stunning and the metal influence in this track pulled me (Dirk) in completely. this is why Tom MacDonald is truly one of the G.O.A.T.s
Your recognition is long long overdue.
Tom, as always... BAM 🔥🔥🔥 NOVA and Jared WOW WOW WOW!!
Love the electric guitar 🎸
Jared and Nova did NOT have to go that hard. Fawk >_<
You dont rap like any rapper i know this days. Wish more did ther thing like you Tom. All that fake stuff about meaningless things like gold and cars, bring the realniss back to hiphop thank you for that love
Wow just wowww mannn🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Awesome, love the heavier sound to this one
This song is phenomenal. Y’all don’t get it. He deserves #1 all day every day! Tom never fails to blow my mind. Each time I think he can’t top himself next thing you know boom. 🤯 He goes above and beyond for everyone! Can’t compare!
You need a concert!!!!
Lets start a riot
Let’s start a riot
Looks like a mostly peaceful city in that video
As a Disabled Veteran of the US Army.  I HATE US Government, they are Fascist horrible disgusting things. They all should be prosecuted and found guilty. And then immediately taken out to a very tall tree with a very short rope.  We all need to recognize that Democrats and Republicans are disgusting criminals nothing more. And only those who support true freedom and the one creator. Our valid leaders or could be judged as good judges. All these other disgusting filth need to be called.
🔥🔥Let's start a Riot 🔥🔥
Keep em coming Tom and Nova! Relationship goals right there! ❤️

In love ! & I love how you changed it up! That beat is sick!
“I’m so independent, but I worship Eminem and buy his beats to use as my own music” 😂😂😂😂 You’re not underground dude. You’re just not appreciated by people who listen to ACTUAL rap music and instead make music for a specific political group to further their delusion that they too are independent from the laws and policies of the country that they worship in church as an idol.
Let's start a riot 🔥🔥🔥💯
Love the visusls on this one!! AWESOME
Sweet
Al go rithm ❤️❤️❤️
Let's start a riot, fam!
Honest to God when I heard you the first time... I immediately wanted to know who you were! I am amazed by the whole YOU! Every song... Every beat... Every lyric packs a memorable punch! I wanted to know who YOU were.  I didn't need someone else telling me about you because you struck my senses so hard by your truth it was important to know your name! You and your team are legend already to me... Much thanks!
Absolute 🔥🔥🔥 as usual from Tom with Nova’s editing skills as the cherry to finish it off 🤘🏻💜
Saving hip hop one Friday video drop at a time!! LETS START A RIOT!!!!

Top quality production sir🙌💯👌💪
The reason everywhere you go it’s a riot, is because We The People like the truth and you’re telling it.
Some may not agree with me on this, but the one good thing I can say about mainstream is that it's a very surefire way of getting the message to the masses. I'm just saying... Either way, Tom MacDonald, you keep it real and that's what's really important.

These comments are a riot! 🙃
Hello Fam ⚡
I like the video more than I like the song.  It’s cool or whatever, just prefer other records.
Love this type of music. The quiet part was such a great change of beat too. 💯👍
His ego is getting quite inflated.
⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Love it! Keep it up brother!
Haters don't realize that Tom represents something more than just his lyrics, his fame, his music, his ideals or his fans. He represents hope and freedom because he is standing up for what he believes in. I don't agree with everything Tom but I have his back because he has the right to exist and thrive in this space and that includes the parts I like and the parts I don't. God bless you Tom keep fighting the good fight.
Shake em up 💪 love that 6 feet under ground rapper 🔥🔥🔥🔥

This is so freakin good. I haven't heard anything like this. Amazing!
Just listen to the words. Says it all!
I love your music 🫶🏼 Can we talk about the laws that protect the crooked hospital that almost killed my newborn intentionally? Crooked world we live in
I like the sound with the guitar and the video on point as always but not a fan of the lyrics or the song itself
This is another banger, chills man
Blessed 🙏

Visually one of the best you’ve done- I got chills! Your talent never ceases to amaze me Tom…fantastic job to the Hangover gang
Kid I'll give it to you. Nobody is willing to sing like you. Most humans are already programed,but ,that end is coming soon. If 1928 was bad,imagine now with 10x the population. WWG1WGALL 🇺🇲 first.
Keep em coming my brother!!!!!!
Do you meet your Lord with this face?

C list for life.
The first 10 words hit hard personally. Great song. Your music speaks to me and so many others!
Tom, I bought your song. It's been a long time since I have purchased music. Much success to you sir, let's get you to the top of the billboards. ❤️
LETS START A RIOT!!!!
I understand why some fans might not like this one....Personally it's one of my new favourites
This video was amazing and very helpful information. I really like this video. I am waiting for your next video update. Thank you for sharing this video.
Love it ...!
Another amazing and powerful song from Tom. The world needs more people like you, but there will always only be one Tom McDonald!
I love Tom and all his music but this one is just not it...
🤘🖕🖕🤘
The message is the nail and Tom just keeps producing hammers, love he added the bit heavier almost alternative spice in there on this one!
Miss the lyrical shit tbh, curious to see how the music keeps evolving
Let’s start a riot! You are the man Tom! Love you and Nova ❤️
LETS START A RIOT! A RIOT! LETS START A RIOT!

Ine more great production byTom and Nova !👍🏼
Damn 🔥
Tom is obviously talented along with being a much needed force in today's counterculture movement. Hopefully he'll only continue to grow and find enough success as to not fade away.
So 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 💯%Another song on My Playlist, Much Love ALWAYS FAM ❤️ Tom & Nova #HOGFORLIFE ,Damn I Love This Banger!!!!!
Not too crazy about this song. I do like rap songs that have guitar riffs in them. I just wasn't feeling the flow in the song. I do like a lot of your other tracks. Still give you my support just to stick it to the machine. Fuck em. It's funny cuz it's very similar to that Tim pool song and he's been shouting you out lately. His song is well produced but I'm not a fan of that one either due to how whiny it is for the majority of the song but for the same reasons I give him my support as well.
great music video! excellent production
legend!
1000%
Lets start a riot 🔥🔥💥💥💥
Keep Rockin Tom!!!!!! Love IT!!!
STAND UP!!!!
Let’s start a riot!
Yo.... this shit rips so hard son! That heavy guitar riff over top so clean. Next level achieved Tom. Well done Sir.
Lets start a riot! 🔥

Lets start a riot!!!!
Haven’t liked a song form you in a while but this one hits More like this please

Another good banger to lift to......!!!!!!
I’m so glad you’re back Tom! We have missed you. But I’m glad you had some time to yourself. Way to come out swinging with one hell of a banger! This is friggin awesome. Lets start a riot!!
Let's start a riot !
God damn; you could not pay me to set foot inside Nova's head.  Great job team.
Tom this is amazing! Hangover FOREVER!
This is the most basic white rap ever and he’s claming he hates pop lol. Terrible song, terrible video terrible guy. Why do people like this?
Tim Pool sent me here, decent song but he's dreaming if he thinks it'll be number 1
Let’s start a riot
Nova and Tom Rock keep cooking ass my brother and my sister
Amazing music..keep it up❤
Really honestly nothing special about this song. And videos kinda cool but it's just repetitive.. step backwards in my opinion.
Can't buy on Amazon
Well done
Rockin' Brother! Rockin', keep it up.
First 5 seconds of this video showed me that this is the best video production you’ve done to date!   My fave rapper since 2017, love everything you’re putting out my brother, much love from Canada 🇨🇦❤️❤️
This video is fackin' awesome!  But I seriously wish I Ioved the song as almost all of the past songs.
Lets start a riot!!!! Riot hogs everywhere!!! 🔥🔥🔥

Amazing I love how talented you are and I hope you never accept a record label and they make you change your ways. We all love you the way you are now and the visuals were fire just like your song
Aight I was brought from Tim Pool when he mentioned u on his podcast, weird how things can get connected. I’ve been consuming ur music for the past 3 hrs. Your a breath of fresh air in this polluted world. I would love to see a collab with Eric July from backwordz, I would be so giddy. Tom your an inspiration and a true poet thank you and God bless!
Dude I'm getting so sick of YouTube making it hard to find your new video every time. Now when it comes out. You literally have to type in every single thing. From Tom McDonald riot just to get the video to pop up. Not to mention I am subscribed to your channel and it doesn't even show that I have a new video from you on my subscription stuff. I mean literally you are such a threat to the woke mob that they're doing everything they can to make it hard for you to get to views. Don't worry buddy. I'm telling everybody I know about this new song and the visuals of this song are phenomenal. Thank you for what you do brother and I will always support you.
I'm glad we're starting to get the old Tom back.......
Bro, this is my new favorite of his! Nothing but 🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥dude those guitar riffs? Whaaaat?
You have come so far! Been a fan since helluvit, and you just steady improve yourself!

Love it❤️❤️❤️
Freaking amazing Tom as always! Let's start a riot! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Let's start a riot 😈
I doubt ANY of the top rappers today would even be in the top 100 if it weren't for their media and marketing machines. Mad respect for the talent... the work and creativity you guys always bring. You're all true artists.
LOVE YOU TOM AND NOVA
860k in 18 hours ...... not enough
Lets start a riot!
I Like the lightnings but not the sound, the personal computer with transparent sides and water cooling you can see but not hear and a transparent Swatch you can see but not hear or figure out how it Works, i am a man of wealth and taste you can see me but never hear a words of comfort and compasion, my lessons Will never enlight you like lesson of Christ, my thoughts are not calm like those of Shangri La, can you guess my NAME or my DESTINY
LET’S START A RIOT!!! 🤘🔥
Tom’s music explains what the typical American feels but can’t verbalize. They can’t even understand the craziness of our so called leaders, much less describe it and Tom explains the madness artistically with such brilliance. It’s truly an amazing talent.
They refuse to recognize you but your a boss! Keep up the good work supporting you all the way!
Start a riot
That was badass man
damn that was great keep up the great work. HOG4life

Love this song tom keep it up my friend
Let's start a riot!! 😁
I bet pedohitler loves this!  Great work!
☠️ 💀 🔥 LETs sTART A RIOT 🔥 💀 ☠️
That beat is fire!! MGK Vibes
Tom always says the truth and this song is awesome. Nova has a gift for small details and catches people's eyes.  Tom and Nova have my respect for standing up for not just themselves but this great nation  I call home. Tom knows how to be humble and respectful. This song does deserve to be number 1 because the way he used guitar in his song, I never thought of that.
Wish I could see you live some day.  Keep them videos coming.  Oh and you need to be on timcast irl 😂 🤣
Gotta give you some props for production bro. 👏
YOU ARE THE MAN! FOCK WOKE AGENDA!
Bro, Tom! Swear to fuggin gawd man, hardest video, and single out this year out of any artist. I hope it bangs too cuz if it do it’ll be on repeat in my car. If it don’t, next time your in the studio boost some lows for me 😆 na for real tho 🔥
For independent thinkers, content creators and platforms, keep pushing! Break the censorship and brainwashing. 🔥This needs to be on Rumble. ✌❤👍
Let’s start a riot
Another hit!
Another 🔥  song!
Oh wow awesome Tom, love it 😊🙏🤘🙏🤘♥️
i love the metal touch to the instrumental. some nu-metal like stuff would seem really cool
What a time to be alive, Tom. Wish you well brother

I think we need some WOKE shit so Tom can sing about it. Did nothing for me not like his older songs did. I don't think main will sign him up sorry Tom.
Man told and show some truth , why so quiet, lately there is s lot of lightnings but no sound of Thunder , seems to be the God of Thunder invented silencer
Lets start a riot!
Man gone all out on this as soon as the reveal name cover said riot I knew he was gonna straight spit some good stuff I had my bets correct good job Tom always beasting these raps love riot gave it a like just like all the rest of your songs
Nova! Bro, she's amazing! I like the VFX as well. Good song, too.
Hmmm... Tim from timcast said I needed to watch this crap. LOL. Not my kind of music. Is he talented and good. Yes. But I don't pay for things I don't like. I wish you all the best Tom, but your music isn't for me.
Riot For the Real People
Your music NEVER disappoints. I love love love your music, Nova  Rockefeller you rock girl, y’all are amazing. ❤️❤️❤️❤️

Kinda underwhelming for the wait. The beat is dope, but lyrically lacking and not saying much of anything new.
Awesome!
What a weirdly small pile of skeletons.
Better than 100% of the mainstream shit.

TRUMP 2024 ULTRA MAGA 🇺🇸🇺🇸👌
kind of slaps
Does this auto-tuned 'singer' know the meaning of the word "riot"?
No clue what this song is about, only thing I get is where this male version of Lady GaGa goes there is a riot.  In this song are Riots a good thing?  Like BLM, & Antifa riots are something we want or need?
This is very amazing song.. It's really nice.. I love this song🎵🎵🎵
Omg I swear u are better then EMINEM seriously!! Keep making music Tom!!!
Nova went big brain with these visuals! You rock, girl! Love the song! Love the message! Keep it up! <3
Let’s start a RIOT!!!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This video is on point
UUUUMMMM......This is fucking AWESOME....LOVE THE HEAVY GUITAR....MUCH LOVE TOM.....
Underground rapper had a new meaning,
I really dont like rap at all, but new release after release, Him and Adam, here I am again.......
Let's start a riot !!!
Hey man, you are doing so great....keep the good work up Following from Ghana 🇬🇭🇬🇭
Not so good as other. BUT still dope
Really dig the darker sound the guitar is better yeah the metal vibe fits a lot better than the pop sing along sounds this's a lot better easier to take seriously too. But this one's fire.
Ayooo!? Trending #2!?? HOG FAM SOUND OFF!! 🗣
Incredible effects and mash of instruments. Truly an experience of a video.
Do a song with ryan up church that'd be fkm epic
Yo Tom hit up my guy Vlogging with Greg is his channel been following him for awhile he has 50k subs now and he has always supported you and loves the Family and you bro check him out help him out with a comment even maybe idk lol just sharing check him out he always rocks your shit real guy also
"No-one knows your name that's why you always gotta name drop". Jesus, I hope you had the fire department on standby for that line!
Awesome video...
I love your song TOM
Awesome Tom!. As always! ❤️🤟
Tom MacDonald's production of his music videos truly is amazing for being completely independent!! Shout out to the Hangover Gang!!

Love the beat and so happy for you it’s just not relatable, I get that your writing about what you going through though so you do you and we Will support it.
Love you guys… a hell of a lot of good work visually… but having listened to everything you’ve done.. sadly (for me) this track just doesn’t cut the mustard 🤔 I’ve been trying, hoping it grows on me…  Thanks guys, we love you 😘
🥰HOG🥰
I dont like ego songs. So bad that its only you and your haters in the song. There is so much in the world to tell, and you choose this? Naaahh   I expected more.

Nova killed this video what a powerful couple
You need to make an appearance on TimCast IRL.
American culture is absolutely awful, zero respect
LETS START A RIOT🔥😈
Tom, excellent graphics on this one💯👍😎 🔥🎸🔥
I've never heard of you but this sh!t is hard to watch. Imagine the vanity required to act like this on camera then present it to millions of people. The working class will be coming for you bourgeoisie leeches when the real riots start if yall keep robbing us who have so little and less everyday. See you then mommas boy
We need to protect this man with everything we have! Nothing but love and support for the truth!
Was decent enough alot of the same stuff in the lyrics as many previous songs, the visuals were fire but just getting sick of the constant posts to keep watching an emails. Your gona put people off imo. I understand your an independent artist but you have a big platform on YouTube it's the same shit every video bombarding us with posts an emails to keep watching an downloading. You can't force people to like you and your music. Not hating atall as I like you and your music just how it's coming across to me.
Let's start a RIOT! ! !
Production values for independent is amazing and both video and music.
Thank you for sharing video
Let us start a riot and protest against our economy and politicians. As we agree towards our differentiations an assemble similarities and comparisons that affirm rather than judge or reject/ deny another's will to think or speak. 💯. T-R-U-S-T!

Damn. These visuals combined with the lyricism and instrumentals results in some intense emotional impact. So well done!
Maaaan.  I really don't like you any more.  I loved you before, but not any more.  Sure you've heard this countless times, you probably already stopped reading this comment.  You once asked me for a sample of my cg via email.  The cg in this video, and the lyrics, and the lame return, is just....disheartening.  It's even more sad that all these people still think you're some kind of special piece of something.  Is there anything in this world that is worth loving any more?
Tremendous video, thank you very nuch for share this, I really like it
🤘🤘🤘
You are amazing.  I love your songs and what you have to say.  Keep it coming is all I can say.
Let's start a riot!

These words he says is amazing and is meaningful indeed.

Holy shit tom. 1) I love the mesh of rock and rap. The right balance. 2) DAMN NOVA, those visuals are fucking ill.
Sick!

Tom does it again! Another banger to the collection.
Same song every time lol. Let's go home grandpa.
I can’t wait to go to a Tom Concert.  I’m tempted to follow him around the states like the Grateful Dead
Lets Riot!
IF YOU SEE THIS - COMMENT “Lets start a riot”! Lets blow up the comment section!
Yes!!!!!
GREEDGLE
Says he "hates pop", then a minute later proclaims, "i'mma pop star...". I rock with most of Tom's music, but the blatant hypocracy, especially when the contradiction is in the same song is definitely becoming a pet peeve for me as listener. The more i listen to his music the more evident it is that he is either trying to have his cake and eat it to or that he truely is immature as a human being and should take some time to sort out who he is truely or at least get his messaging straight because it's becoming quite confusing. Still questionably #HOG. Peace.
Yo! Let's start a RIOT!!!!
🔥Let's start a riot🔥
LET’S START A RIOT! 🔥🤘
Come on HOG Fam! Let's start a riot!! Hangover Gang forever!

I love your vedioes. Your wife is right . You did not follow any rule.
Another banger! Keep doing it man. Hang Over Gang forever bro!
I want to know who this song is about..it sounds like theres definitely beef.Am I the only one hearing it? As always Tom great song&Nova amazing production.

??Excellent Video. My wife says that Im not a Rule Follower... I just choose to make my own path and not let others determine my future... "even if I didn't make another dollar... I'm Blessed !"... ???? Love this Vid."
YOOO THIS IS A BANGER 🔥
No my favourite song coming from you, but still hitting the same message. Keep it going tom! Massive potential still to come! Plus I'm a massive fan, love all of the other songs. Edit- gave it a few more listens and it's grew on me💯😜👍
The only blessing greater than your musical talent, Tom, would be a baby to love and nurture.  With you and Nova, that baby would be one of the best to ever grace this earth. I understand you dont think you're ready. I thought I was prepared until the moment I looked at my son's little face. It is inspiring like nothing I ever knew. Take the plunge, you won't regret it.
This is awesome ! I love you tom . This production,this voice,everything is nice.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
You still number 47 worst but best to me
Yes sir
Good shit yo
Tom MacDonald's production of his music videos truly is amazing for being completely independent!! Shout out to the Hangover Gang!!
Way to go Tom… but Nova killing it with her mad skills, I see you Nova!!!! Y’all are awesome!!!!
explain the upside cross tom at 24 seconds on mask smh all the same
Time to win the culture war, let's go #1.
This video is great
this is music is very nice thanks for sharing
I support U Tom(a fan since 2021) I’m from Myanmar
Welcome back Boss!!!
Good Song, love the 4K, a little short tho..
I don't use itunes (or anything Apple related)  but I'm happy to watch this video again to hopefully bump it up to #1 where it belongs.
You can not be denied the independent legend you are.
Even though I stand behind the seens and just listen to your music tom I still think u the best rapper I listen to all your music love it keep speaking up about shit not many do and stay blessed.
Fire
I got the night owl email. I don't have itunes, but I can definitely watch this video again.... and again
# 1 in Rap and Hip Hop!!! Killing it!!!
Tom I would love to see you do a song with Tim Pool. You two are both keeping the independent music alive at this point. You guys tag team a song dissing the corruption of the music industry and really go hard on it, that would be incredible.
Why is it censored!!!!
I don't know what you say that,  i totally support him.that was straight fire.
Fucking amazing , i loved the incorporation of the guitar. Would love to hear more of it ! Another hit as usual
Love this Tom!!!!
Even if i don't make a $ again am blessed. Tom Macdonald be independent but doing great things. Great video.
Great song but that video damn that's awesome 👌
🤝
Tim pool sent me. I also bought the song on iTunes

Excellent Video. My wife says that Im not a Rule Follower... I just choose to make my own path and not let others determine my future... "even if I didn't make another dollar... I'm Blessed !"... ???? Love this Vid."
Woooo! Gotta give love to Nova for this. Amazing.
Love the beat and so happy for you it’s just not relatable, I get that your writing about what you going through though so you do you and we Will support it.
excellent 👍🏻 are you going to tell us who you sniping at. I think I have an speculation....but I would rather be sure. Love you owning you re #1. HOG fam forever ♾️ 🤟🏻
Nice job sir, keep it up...
Bro doesn't hit xgames mode... He is the mode.
HI GUYS, FOLLOW ME.
Your an amazing Artist buddy,Thank you
Wow great l love this video... you killed it.. keep it up.
Watch this again and again, still blows my head away     LETS GOOOOOO🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The usual trash from “political rappers”
beats dope lyrics kinda lackin
Bad ass songs guys. Nova the video turned out great. Love you guys.
BAAAAANNNNNNNGGGGGGGEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR !!! Sick my dude!!
As usual, hooks are trash.
Right the F on! Tom you did it again! Love the back hook.
legendary freestyle 2->https://youtu.be/TuicMslyNs8
quite good but i expected more than a couple bar verses.
Hi Tom MacDonald  Riot which is currently your new song release. Not sure if I'm 100% on board with this song. But everyone has a different opinion. There's quite a few songs that I do like. Which are whiteboyz, the system,  fake woke and snowflakes and many more. I'm sure Nova did alot of work when it came to the songs backdrop. Congratulations to Nova as well and any other who helped you too. Good luck & best of luck too
Excellent!
❤️🔥🔥
Nova did a badass job on this video. This and canceled are my favorite effects wise. Hell of a job Nova!!!
It's Hang Over Gang forever
Im so glad that sombody from a genre other than rock or metal covers serious topics, other than stupid shit. Keep it up bro.
Yo, this song's visuals were dope af! (especially the skullnado)
🔥🔥🔥
Tom! Go on Timcast. He is trying to build culture like you. He told people to check out your new song. Would love to see you raw and real on a show like Tim Pools
That was 🔥 💪🎶
So, one question: Does the name Nova "ROCKAFELLER" have anything to do with the Rockefellers? Can someone dig into the family tree? I think this would be quite interesting.  Also I wonder, why is this guy standing on a bunch of skulls and sings about riots? As the new NWO-Agenda is poverty and hunger, followed by Civil unrest? Just asking questions as a European who thinks critically.
thats a little different.. i like points of views but all the songs kinda sound similar..
Not your best, but ok
🔥🔥🔥🔥
this is what independent music and artist sound like and why I listen to it
hell fuckin yeah!! added to my driving to work playlist !! killed it!!!
🔥
🔥🔥
The fans have the most interesting array of @ hope you know ur touch all kinds even though this is hardly ur best(which is yet to come)
Love this song
Both Jesse Sakal Walla
Another great song...  its got that rock and rap feel...  great video too..
the bones are tight
I love it!! Especially the guitar riffs! Hard af, bruh! Killing it.
Not bad!  I really like the bits of heavy metal guitar mixed in....keep speaking truth!
On Crip?
Powerful voice
Good tune but not even close to comparing to your previous music.
ULTRA_BEAST_MODE [activate] *RIOT*
Tom MacDonald's production of his music videos truly is amazing for being completely independent!! Shout out to the Hangover Gang!!

Thanks Tom, for making art/music great again 👍 👏
I love this song. Great work   Thanks for sharing this video ❤
The production of this video with its graphics and design is outstanding! You all should open your own business . Love the choreography . Very multitalented with Projection Designer, "Media Designer", Cinematographer and Video Director . The design of this video is hell of a lot better then these signed artists with their outdated crappy music videos  . Good job Nova!! Nova rocks!!

Awesome song and what an amazing video. Total fire once again man. I greatly appreciate you and Nova and crew
Swinging from the tattered ropes of yesterdays hope i have nothing left to say All the dreams i held dear all the friends i kept near departed on that midnight train could not refrain and  theres only me left here to blame . I dont want or need the fame and money is just something more to gain. I am quiet because there is nothing more left for me to say my game is over i lost ok?
THIS WAS DOPE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Holy shit this beat and these dynamics in lyrics and beat building... Yeah I fucks with this song. Banger
I've listened to this song 20 times today easy. This one seriously slays dragons Tom! You, Nova, and Jared absolutely gave the #HOG exactly what we needed!
You Tube won't show me what you're trending at! I hope everyone else can see it. Cheers Big Fulla👍
Man went in on this one
Dude right on. Thank you for sticking to your guns. Always on point.  Some people rather call out the BOOGIE MAN and some rather cry Victim.  Maybe you can use this.
Not my bag on this one but still givin the power couple their thumbs up.
🔥🔥🔥
Just wonderful video..it's really make my day.my husband type of music..we totally support him..this is absolutely fire...rock on.. thanku for this music.
The video is great Tom and Nova!!! The music is ok but I can’t relate to it. But you have the right to legit claim this shit!!
Epic 🔥
Down by the river  Its good to hear  there’s still truth  I’m only recluse  To stay away  my own noose    Blessed be and thank you
Can we get this much metal, more beat (not just bad bass), and more SPICY nova? Love y'all HOG FAM
Absolutely amazing lyrics! We the people, get the message! The G.O.A.T. of independent music, and of the criminal gate keepers of the music billboards! What "Clowns!" It's a [RIOT] I do no not hear Tom on the radio driving to work, where I give over half of my earned money to our "government!"
Rip queen
Hey Tom! Tim Pool recommend that I stop by Amazon and get your new track and I'm glad I did. Keep being your rebellious self.  I'm really hoping to see more of you soon
cringe
Very good video 👍👍👍
this here 🔥
Oh this was a good one!
BECAUSE THE SOLUTION SUCKS ........................
Yo Tom I discovered you because of tim pool and Timcast. I love it. Yeah. You rockin the culture jam.
Tom's standing on the bones of everybody the system has killed.  All these years and he is still spitting facts with zero fucks given towards any of the fake woke that want him to remain silent.  100% or nothing at all!  That's what I admire about Tom the most! Also Fuck Billboard 😎
As a member of the juggalo community i accept this human as a member of or community
It's the way of the non Conformist, the Malcontent, the Dissident......the Renegade. Rock on Tom 👍👍 sharp piece, many thanx to U & Nova. Much ❤️ Youse guys.
I fucking love this
😃
YES! Tom, you have done it again, love your music, and your and Nova's dedication to it. Y'all really blew my mind with this one, the effects are freakin awesome, especially the skull mountain, even if it stunk building it, it made the video awesome! Thank you for another amazing video!!
Love your work Tom
Jesus loves you
I don't know who you are responding to but I am embarrassed for them.  My daughter-in-law's dog is named Riot.  I am going to have a hard time refraining.  I think I should warn them.
Also I would give my left arm for those sunglasses 😎
It's very good I really liked it
Nice change!
Tom never change The Truth is a powerful weapon
Tom all of your music is amazing this one’s my favorite it helps me through my hardest times
Nova always does a great job but she freaking dominated this one. She killed it gave it a funeral and dug it up and did it all over again. Nova you deserve a damn award for this you beautiful genius. Tom this is officially my new rage song. Catch me in my minivan dropping the kids off to this song
As always....YOU ROCK....dude, I love this jam. You are such a talented guy! Please keep up the great works/songs lyrical truth.
This was absolute fire! Powerful message as always from you with killer beats, and Special effects like I’ve never seen before from you! Keep it up Tom and Nova! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bro again coming in with a banger 🔥💪💯 very nice visuals great job to nova your sis and yourself 👏👏
Tom UNdoubtably has the MOST diverse FAN base in all of MUSIC....this chat is so upliftin'....Well Done Mr MACdonald...Sincerely
Nikki Minaj is at it again or at least her label is she just dropped 3 versions of the same song. Lets go folks .  Go download NOW. We cant let this happen again!!!!!
This video is really informative about what rich people do, Such a valuable information, Really interesting and great content.There is lot of things to learn in this video, Thank you so much for this useful video, I learned so much.
Wow... this is so nice song.  I love this song. Thank you so much for sharing this video 😘🥰👍👌🤏❤🥰
Nova 😘✨✨✨
*PROTECT THIS MAN*
Whoop Whoop
This video is really good with Tom MacDonald's production of his music videos thanks for sharing information
I'm not hating.  But he said nobody  know you that's why they name drop.  But he actually  said his own name in the song . Oops just made a mistake  thought  your da Biggest  bitch sike not even 5 minutes  went past and you dissed him self ....shame ..... good work though  see how long you can outlast the blast of being  the outcast
Perfect Amazing how much more you keep giving us and how much it gets better and better you are always out doing ur last song its awesome tom!!
Oh yeah!!! Rocking a thousand thumbs up, another bad to the bone song. You are the best no doubt about that...thank you for giving us the best music out there. ❤️✌️😎💯🎵🎶🕊️
Tim Pool sent me here 😂
Shout to Nova and the rest of the crew. Another absolutely beautiful video. Great video. Great song. Keep it up!!
Bought it on ITunes. Love it!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
GaMe changer...simple as that !!
Who else has this on repeat?!!
Independent! fuck mainstream! Get some!
Weakest tom McDonald I've heard in a while. Barely 1 verse in all that noise, & we only get 2 verses max in his songs which is already not enough. I guess it's time to move on for me.
Banger 🔥💪
Blessed?? 😅  the choruses you drop should be called Friday flops... I've heard enough to call your bluff.. you're a conservative zombie bot
Tim Poole shouting you out to make you #1 on the billboards.  Hope it soars high now.. and you will be introduced to new people..  BTW, you and Nova need to make a trip out East and go on the show.. I know you tend to be housebound… but I think you could manage to fly out there safely.
As always....YOU ROCK....dude, I love this jam. You are such a talented guy! Please keep up the great works/songs lyrical truth.
LET'S BRING IT TO NUMBER 1!!!!
Tom sent me here with an email
🔥🔥🔥🔥👊🏻👊🏻👊🏻👊🏻
Even if I never made a dollar again, I'm blessed! #Killerbar
I have one word - Speechless!
Awesome, I think I have watched this video a dozen times and watched at least twice as many reactors videos. Also downloaded the audio and played it on repeat in the car.
Yes.
He is so sick I got goosebumps with that name drop part tom u wanna spend ur life with a enlightened HEATHEN
Truly amazing music video...
If Ritz never hit puberty 🤣😂
OUTSTANDING ⚠️🔥🧯🤙
Hey Tom I can’t believe you remembered my birthday, thank you very much! 😎
Awesome work Tom. Huge well to props nova as well as the production
As always....YOU ROCK....dude, I love this jam. You are such a talented guy! Please keep up the great works/songs lyrical truth.
Love you Tom, but not my favorite.
Did it again😎Another Hit😇
the illest
Love it!
That spike jacket is sick as fuck. Dope ass song. Keep being you!
When Tim Cast sings you praises.....
This video music is very amazing and interesting.  I'm very excited to see this video.  Thank you for sharing video.
Tom & Nova, I think this is gonna hit #1!!
Nova with the visuals 🤩🤩🤩
Liked and shared !!! You the shit!! 💜
Video crushed it. Song's aight
came to shake up the system but this is fire
This coming from a guy that can be full of himself sometimes 🤣. Besides the braggadocios (lines) mentality I agree 💯👍. Keep it up bro. The industry doesn't want you to be humble... But you know you should be... Just speak 🗣️ the truths... You will prosper where it is needed.
Tom (and Nova)...... I love the work you do and I'm really into the music but seriously having to order CDs that have no track data and converting and typing in all the track info so it will display on my media players is kind of a PITA. I'm happy to pay 15-$25 for an album but can't you just provide them in the current downloadable format? The last album or 2 sold too many copies for you to even be able to sign them all. We're not getting anything extra for the wait and updating of the outdated media you offer at this point.   I loved the last album with Adam. I watch the videos and want to see you break records for indie artists but seriously. Snail mail and compact disks to listen to music in 2022? I completely understand if you don't want to give Amazon or Apple a 30% cut of your revenue but at least give your fans the option of paying full price for an album download on your site.   This is my line in the sand, as I have to borrow an external USB CD/DVD device just to rip the album and convert to MP3 format and then type in all of the album & track info.
It's alright...
I'm with you. Fk the industry. 🖕🖕
Definitely downloading to my playlist hog 4 life  ❤️
The Production for the song and the visuals were fantastic. Best song you’ve released in a hot second
did he say "white pac in the flesh"?
Holy shit! It's always incredible to see what you guys create! Keep up the amazing work!
Tim Pool sent me here
God hears all of ur thoughts..
Your music!! Yes. Keep it coming. Awesome job. You guys are mindblowing.
We don't swear... cuz we ain't doing anything by your way
Fuck me.. when you don't think you like a genre and somebody comes spittin' fire like this  God damnit, I got so much to catch up on
Always 🔥
Tom MacDonald owns himself and his own music and Nova owns herself and her own digital artwork... And they share themselves and their creativity with us.  Who else can say that in this industry?  #H.O.G
Standing on their bones.....BRILLIANT !! Stay true. Peace all. Keep supporting INDEPENDENCE.
Reminds me of Pazuzu Algored. Still like his roll. Speaks truth like Rage Against the Machine. SUBBED!!!
Wow! Excellent. Not my favorite by far in response to the song (still amazing though) but that video was next level. You’d think you had a label and 30 people working on this in the graphics department. Hat’s off to whoever put this together. I’m assuming Nova. Absolutely insane to see this quality from 2 people and a dream. Praying blessings on your whole operation 🙏🏻
I love the little bits of chugging in the song, I'm by no means a rap or hip hop fan, but Toms music brings chills to my spine, his lyrics are powerful, his music has great hooks, I gotta be honest, it's refreshing to hear this kind of music and it not be about guns, drugs, and women
Tom is killin' it again! Probably my favorite lyricist in 20 years
Tom is hands down the best rapper these days . He’s the realest it gets . Always rapping about something that matters . Never goes without impressing me. He doesn’t get enough credit. Thank you Tom McDonald
I Really like your music. Seems like lately your getting a "BIG HEAD", stay true to your origins.
Never ceases to AMAZE me. The man is truly brilliant.
Love your music. Enjoyed the visual upgrade. Didn’t feel the lyrics though. Usually, there’s depth, felt it was missing here
Tom.... I know I am nobody to you because you're big. Been a fan for years. In October I'm getting a "see you tomorrow" tattoo. Hope that's okay with you.. you have helped through so mNy things. I'm stronger now than ever. I listen to the brave every single day for like 5 months on cd. Lol. You help me. Thank you!! 😊
Dam, banging!*****
I think an image of you standing on all of those bones should be on a tee shirt!
meh
Great stuff as always!
This one is very different. I really like it though. Great visuals!
YouTube is actually allowing Tom to trend huh.  You can only deny his #1 songs or so long and then it gets too obvious
Them bars be banging! Keep up the great work brotha
WOW! Your 💪 have grown strength. 👍👍
Instantly hit my Spotify, and iTunes!
Bloody loved it, Nova killing it with the video
Thank you.
I wish i was the queen so i couldve died before to hearing this
Here's to the algo Tom 👍
I'm so sick of hearing how I should spend all my money on drugs and women. I should do things that will take away everything I worked for for clout. I like this. It's fresh. It's real. Real struggle. Real ambition. Stay outta the system brothers. Where was this when we were kids?
I love the video Tom. Middle fingers to em all lol
Ahhhh I love thiiiis🔥🔥🔥🔥
Why are the lyrics sensored??
Wow, Nova your creativity is mind blowing 🤯, and your skills with the camera is a gift and talent.. Great job as usual 😉👍 J's Wife 😇 Lin 🇺🇸🙏☮️❤️🍩 PEACE LOVE AND DONUTS 😁
Finally a good song. I wish you'd just stick to this, but I understand you have to speak your mind. I don't care for the political gimmicky/corny music, but I still respect the talent. But these songs are why I'm a fan.
A Beeeautiful Peace/Piece of Art❣ ~ Thank You Tom
💯? ✅ keep it up and teardown the industry!!!
Keep streaming this video run the numbers up! Let's get it to number 1 !!🔥🔥🔥🔥
Tom's lighting the 🔥🔥🔥. Great song and visuals.
YES! Tom, you have done it again, love your music, and your and Nova's dedication to it. Y'all really blew my mind with this one, the effects are freakin awesome, especially the skull mountain, even if it stunk building it, it made the video awesome! Thank you for another amazing video!!
🔥🤘😝🤘🔥
more skeletons and evil imagery in the videos idk about this guy anymore tbh
Another hit!  Nova you are a genius!
LOVE your music Tom. But really want to hear something with way less chorus and more into the verse. Especially in a "talk yo shit" song like this.
Outstanding  Thank you!
Why the upside down cross?
Tom be careful brother…demons can come as a friend then once they have you they slowly eat away at you until there is nothing left…. keep your enemies close but God closer, praying for you don’t hold the pain release it, you speak so much truth now you gotta speak truth to yourself
💕🔥💕🔥💕🔥💕🔥💕
Soared to my number 1
This production, this voice, this Tom, everything is 🔥🔥
Love it sick as helnlike always keep it up
Another brilliant song brother. Keep up the great work
This shits fire
Mic Drop 🎤  ,  🖕 🖕 Lets Gooo HOG
2 new albums soon.
I love your music the visuals were cool but honestly this is not nearly your best song I would put almost any song you've done above this one Just being honest like you I feel you'd appreciate it
666k views??? That's unacceptable. It should be 777 million!!!
666k views and 2nd place trending I guess there are devil's trying to stop him from getting 1st place again
Sign of the Times, another Best of the Best!  Tom you and your crew are the best at what you do.  #1 all around, keep it coming!
No youtube notification for the video drop .
lets fucking go tom!!!!
🤘😎🔥
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life. told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and liberates and gives eternal life. 63
Imma give you both my middle fingers to give to the haters! Bitchnitchez be jealous of your rhythm and truth. Love. Respect. Bring us more!
Brother keep crushing it.
Just wanted to print out the 666k views
Video production top notch love it 🔥
Listening to the words I could not help but picture Tom as President Trump calling out Biden on Trumps big rallies while Biden couldn’t fill a phone booth!  I know you millennials may not understand what a phone booth is so heres help: its the thing Superman uses to do a costume change and for you Britts its like the Tardis that Doctor Who travels through time and space in.  To be fair the Tardis is much bigger inside than the outside appearance suggest.  Anyway, another great one Tom.  Keep them coming like this and we will buy them.
This is shit
Tom did it AGAINNNN! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yup. New song for the workout mix. 🔥💪🦍
Good song video could be better but still great stuff!!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I came from nothing and you help inspire me to never stop always leave it better than I found it . Thank you from the heart
I like it....Groovy Dude !!!!!...fucking eh !!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is fucking incredible.
haven't been here in a bit. i came here to be like tom dropped off... fuck i was wrong... this is fire.
Received your email! Good luck getting to #1. You deserve it.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is sick.
Yooooo these videos are insane!! This song def just got added to the work out playlist!! Good job!!!!!!
Love the song but I love the music video even more! It’s wildly insane 🔥
I've watched this three times now. The second time was at just under 40k views. As of right now it's 663,730 views
Wanted to like this but, eeeesh pretty bad. Couldn’t tell when it was the chorus or the verse. Bad production too. Not a hater just trying to understand
The skull raising/lifting (resurrection?) effect was dope.
Stop with the damn auto tune. It dates the music.
#2 on trending!!lets get #1!!
Nova Nova girl, your visuals. You are the GOAT!!!! Tom loving the whole song, especially the HOOK
Tom Motherfucking MacDonald… Again.
Love the music in this one and of course the lyrics kick ass! Posted 12 hours ago and over 663k views!! Even haters cant deny that Tom is a bad ass and him and Nova together.... EXPLOSIVE!
This is crazy. Absolutely love this! I always get so nervous on fridays when you're dropping new music. I don't know why I feel like a total dumb @ss after watching the video and today was no exception! I have been subscribed for about 2 years now I usually stay pretty quiet as far as the critics go because no matter what I say it will never be as good as Tom saying it. He is an absolute master in letting people know just how they can f**k Off! This time though I have to say if you are one of those special people out there that have to try to talk s**t, just stop he is making you look more stupid with every Friday that comes around.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Song definitely getting me amped.
I ❤️This!!
👽 🔥 🔥
He's talking about tekashi69 pretty sure
Good stuff. Great flow ! Great honesty!🔥
Ayo what is going on up in this comment section? XD this song a damn banger my phone caught 🔥 🔥 🔥 like damn Tom you went in on this video. Love the music. Keep killing them tracks and showing people the truth that everyone needs to hear!!

It's OK, nothing special! He has done much better tracks
Obsessed already! Love it Tom!!!!
Come on people lets get this awesome mofo to number 1 on trending Youtube as a giant middle finger to anyone who says he shouldn't be so popular as a independent artist. Hog 4 Life you just don't have any bad songs.
Imagine ever putting this hot diarrhea around other people

He wasn't kidding about how good this one is. I think its my new favorite jam of his 💜🙀
💥💥💥💥💥💥💥BOOOOM AS ALWAYS STRAIGHT 🔥
I can’t count the times I’ve watched this and played on Spotify and the one I bought from iTunes. ❤️‍🔥🔥🔥🔥
Effortlessly. Tom the goat bro. You keep my head straight through all the bullshit going on.
@Tom MacDonald dude you are so awesome. I'm a smalltime video DJ from Louisiana and want to purchase a license to legally play your videos at my shows. I refuse to pirate music especially from independent artists and since you never know what truths you spit will be relevant locally here and want to have my pick at all of them to make my own personal point. If I get a reply, then we'll figure out how to further this purchase. Mad LOVE man, I honestly believe you're doing it & slowly changing the culture. PLEASE. NEVER STOP!
Damn dogg you and Nova both beasts. The songs a fucking banger but damn that vid is dope as fuck too.
I am so fucking inlove with this! You keep going higher and higher buddy. Your shits dope. Love from a Canadian Bitch xx
TRUTH WILL REIGN! Keep speaking the truth✝️🕊❤️
Haha #2 on trending, between football and politics lmao
Right on Tommy Boy!

This shit right here is why you have so many fans! Fast raps, tight lyrics, sick song.

Wack as fuck. Quit while you're ahead.
Bruh Absolutely amazing!
I don't usually watch or listen to rap music but I listen too him he is awesome

Love your music Tom been a huge fan for yrs and have shared your music with everyone I know. I just gotta ask why the upside down cross on your ski mask at 00:24 seconds?
total fire.  i hope you start dropping on a regular again been missing your music big homie
This my #1 for you bro. You just keep toppin the previous.
Awesome song.  Loved every minute of it.   Can't wait for the album.
Is this a diss song? Where has your lyrical content gone? With everything happening in the world i was hoping itd be more beast mode in your face. Brilliant clip 👌 💚🤙
Hole different caliber of quality man. Goosebumps listening to this first time.
Tom McDonald for President. That's all I got to say. Love bro keep up the great work
YEAHHHHhhh!  Love that heavy guitar in there!
Not my favourite of his songs but once again left impressed by the work Tom has done.
I think you have a better soul and production value than any other "rapper" out there right now. All of your music is FIRE!!!!
Yo this shit #2 on trending?? Bro get it!
Love, love, love!! ❤
Let's get this to #1
Fire
I haven't been keeping up with Tom Macdonalds releases, I used to eagerly await on Friday's. The message is awesome, as always.  I totally l totally fell in love with TMs music years ago. However  the style has changed, which I get, the world doesn't revolve around me,lol. But an old style every once in awhile in a new song would be great. Keep up your anarchist message TM
Good Lawd have mercy, I just had the best eargasm Thomas. And Nova, ur killing it!!! Like top tier, above all the rest killing it with the producing, filming, and editing. Love y'all both and I will be playing the hell out of this here banger for a hot minute.
DAMN NOVA!!!! Her skills are just getting better and better. Of COURSE WE all love Tom. He's getting better and better with his hooks. Major PROPS to the both of ya'll.
Simply Amazing!
ALWAYS 100% plus!!!!!
keep them haters quiet songs a banger brother this will be on my Playlist 10/10
Wish more Musicians would have your courage.

Absolute tuuuuuune!!! And the video 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Love this!!! Love Tom and Nova so talented ❤️
more guitar rifts please
🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻
I’m most likely missing the point but who’s the clown he’s talking about?
Glad he is back to making good music, last few were a miss for me. This one is dope, even the hook lol.
Another freakin masterpiece!! Love!!! Words…truths every damn song!!! ❤️👏👏👏👏
Another freakin masterpiece!! Love!!! Words…truths every damn song!!! ❤️👏👏👏👏
This is some next level shit.  Bravo man,  seriously bravo.
🔥🔥🔥
Another 💯🔥❤️💞
This dude is the real deal
Damn dude, who was that aimed at?....✌
Too tired to move, immediately wake up for new Tom Macdonald music. Sleep is precious to New moms so you matter 😅
Not your best song tbh, yet the visuals are next level
Ooooo nice 👌 I really like the vibe of this one Tom!! Excellent work once again and always!! Best wishes to you and yours forever and always
This was epic! Best yet! Even B. Tatum cannot hate this hook!
I'm a big fan of your music but I don't like this as much as your recent music.
Holy shit this is my favorite Tom song now for sure 🔥 🔥 🌹 🌹🌹🔥🔥
Bought the song on Amazon! Let's rocket this song up the charts!
Damn this is dope AF!! I love the rock feel mixed with your vocals! Killin it!
This is one of them I got on repeat for a month
I love the mix you did in this bra   Much love from down under keep up the amazing tracks brother
The Shades... awesome touch....

I would love to hear an Epitaph written by Tom about those 🦗's to follow Grave Stones. Would be 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Intense visuals..
Love how you reference your day lol. Which is friday
😎
They excited.
This is a sick ass song but I want to shout out Nova and give her props on an awesome video. Both of you are too talented for this shitty world.
As soon as someone comes with facts all the bs talkers are like crickets. Keep'em coming Tom and Nova! much love from UK #HangOverGang4life
The addition of the crickets in the background that are chirping in time with the beat is SICK AF. Stroke of musical genius.
That jacket is nasty. Great video, banger!!
Consider where your soul will spend eternity, heaven or hell.  You don’t want to end up in hell because you rejected the Sacrifice Jesus has made all who repent and turn to him by faith.  We are all guilty of sin.  We lie, steal and look with lust in our hearts.  We are all Guilty before a Holy and Righteous God.  GOD is not just all loving and overlook your sin.  He is loving, but sin He will Judge because He is Perfectly good. The Good news is God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ who was perfectly Holy to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of Love for us.  We can’t keep the Law we break most all commandments.  But Jesus fulfilled ALL by his perfect thoughts, words, deeds and motives for us because we could not. Jesus loved all humans and God the Father perfectly.  Turn, repent of your sin and confess Your thankfulness for what Jesus did for you.  Put your faith in the perfection and the righteousness of Christ.  Jesus was raised from death to give you new life; death has been defeated. Out of love and grace eternal life is promised to those who have faith.                  ,/................,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,./,/.

Well done Tom once again. Always stay true to who you are. That's all you need. Good job ♥️✨
That was good
Not digging the narcissistic lyrics
THISSSSSS is BAD ASS!!!!
I don't know what to say that hasn't already been said. Tom is just incredible, everytime he drops a new song I find myself saying, this is my new favorite. The guy doesn't miss and to be doing what he's doing without the backing of a major label is astonishing. This entire production is straight 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Love you man
Şanışer Amerika şubesi :))
Tom is such an amazing artist and with Nova killing it in the videos it's such a devastating combination.

HANG OVER GANG FOR LIFE!

Sent here threw Tim cast
🔥 🔥 🔥
Hot visuals but the sounds could be better
Only thing I have with the video and skulls would be better if every now and then you move out of the way of them like there actually coming around you and in your face area like woooooh move there's a skull make it more realistic than a green screen but cudos brother it's still awesome but I would have made that move to make it more convincing don't take it wrong no negative remarks but would have been more selling if you acted with them while rapping but still fucking fire and my fav to date fucking badass brother love it keep them coming very moving truth spoken..... But that's might take on it not to diss or anything just would loved some interaction with the skulls flying around lol like wtf and move out of the way would be awesome but still awesome no matter what thanks for the awesome vids and music your number one fan cuz I have hog tatted on left hand beside dax that my two favs of all time rest are jokes and sellouts fuck the industry other fav song first take of it not second but it's fire also lol ...love y'all brother keep it coming and spread the truth....
Saying hi to all the haters below.  Snowflake.
Much like your jacket this songs on point 😎
ok great song but........ if you are a believer now what is up with the downside cross on your mask? i am trying to keep it real and would love an interview about your faith. i am part of your discord and love your music i think you have the greatest intentions but i have questions. please i hope you see and reach out to me because a lot of fans have the same questions. thanks respectively lith
I've been blasting this and Gumbo all day.  The hook goes so hard on this track
Have Tom and Tech done a song together yet?! That would be some dope shit!
DB is in Santa Monica CA
Common mcdonald W
lmao this is so cringe
Never fails to impress
I like this style Tom. FYI they didn’t tell me you had a new song. Might be some shadow banning. Idk just saying I have the bell 🔔 and everything
Always a good day when Tom drops
hmm removed from trending. Woke staff are not happy.
wow I was very reluctant to check u out bc of the face tats I thought you were like the rest of the mumble rappers so glad u got popular enough to pop up frequently  enough to give you a chance. it was a big mistake to judge a book by its cover I love what you represent  and how artistic you are in your vids much respect to you its well earned and deserved.
Nahhhhh. White Pac my ASS!!! You're good. Not on this particular song. But you're good. But Pac??? Not even in his league homie. 💯
Insane song, insane video too 🤘🤘 nothin but the best from you guy's 🤘🤘 wish I had 2000 to get that outfit in the vid with all the spikes on it. Would go nice with my gladiator helmet I have from the movie. But honestly nothin but love and respect #tommacdonald and #Novarockerfella. Awesome song #HOGforlife. So glad to be a part of this journey.  Love everything you guy's give us.

This one is like where's Tom?
I always prefer the political songs (like The System and Brainwashed), but this song is still very well done. Also, it always amazes me how great your music videos are considering how small your team is. Great work, Tom!
That was just mindblowingly mesmerizing. Props to you u all
He said he hates pac???? 🧐
Have you seen how many reaction videos there already are of this song, Tom and Nova? 👍🏼👍🏼
Got in, made your point, and got out before we knew what hit us--nicely done, sir!
Blamo! #2 trending
Another great hit... again. Need I say more
You guys killed it…love the rock mix in it too!

Annnnnnnd Tom does it again! Another kick ass song for my playlist!
Awesome work Tom. HUGE props to Nova as well for the production!
Amazing video!  I love the cricket sounds matching the beat too! (🔥x1,000,000)

I am a huge fan, wish you would come to New Orleans. Another hope is to see you hang with Tim Pool and do a lice cast with him! Keep it up man. Your music and passion are amazing!
How does Nova do this?
Hit #1 so we can see you and Tim Pool wear a suit!
So good
Not my fav but there are many other songs from Tom that are awesome.  Keep up the good work!
Top of the charts. Top of my playlist.
It's alright

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🤫🤫🔥🔥🔥🔥
All I can say is DAMNNNNNNNN!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

T2 Vibes
Stop blurring out the profanity! Independent. Your still my boy from the jump but!
Love ya lil brother, but I hope all of the new stuff isnt more of you talking about you. Sorry, but your political stuff is much better. I get that tou gotta slap a few people in the face now and then, but I just like your over all message art better.
This generation offers nothing...
Funny for the views tom gets and how against the main stream industry the only call outside he gets are some what positive.  That says a lot.

Another hit!  Good shit Tom. Share, share & share..  all day..
Fantastic!
One of his worst songs by far. Video is pretty shit too.
This got nothing on In God We Trust, lyrically
🤟🏽🤟🏽🤟🏽
Not bad. Going to look at more of Tom's stuff.
I've been waiting for you to do more songs like this meaning with a rock vibe this is awesome thanks keep it up you the man. 💯
I just heard about Tom MacDonald from Timcast. I think face tattoos are retarded but the song is okay, I give a thumbs up.
Fucking RAD!! This video is awesome and as always…great song.
Noice
Fire 🔥 bro just bad ass 🔥
Don't even come at me. My aim is elsewhere. Love it tho
Mainstream only wishes they were this good and not be a sellout, kanye and em realized they sold themselves to evil people a little to late
TOM!!!! Where you been my guy ? Missed you video brotha and definitely dig this one.
YOU'RE MUISC IS OUTSTANDING!
Hey tom McDonald, how do you feel having a shout out by Tim pool?
TGIF!
Tom killing it, as usual.    Wonder if it gets boring being this great!
3.26M strong!
His music just motivates me in every way
You are a great rapper. Not your best work but still beats anything the mainstream losers are doing, in every way.
Hey Beetlejuice, This is Lame, Taking a Break didn't help, this is garbage compared to what you should be doing...   BOOOOOOOOO
Omfg how is the music video a perfect match... That's the last time I listen before I watch 🔥👑🔥 I wasn't ready for that 0:25 🤯 ffs Tom is a visual artist
Tim Pool been repping you big time. Buy him a burrito.
Loved it 😘🥰🤗😇
Great as usual but your early work seemed to hit harder.
All your songs sound exactly like your last song..
Damn brotha topping the Queen
This 58 year old man likes me some Tom McDonald's music. Keep ripping 'em young man.
👏👏👏👏👏👏Tom MacDonald your Freakin Awesome,  👏😊😊. BRILLIANT 👏 NOVA ❤️🙏
Thanks, Tom.  I just heard Tim Pool plugging this song for two hours.  It's everything his hyperbole made it out to be.
Every track is same 😂
Nice!
Images remind me of indie film Take Shelter (things going UP). "There is a storm coming like nothing you have ever seen and not a one of you is prepared for it!"
Amazing!
I like the metal feel to your song.
Well I'll be Damned!!! Thomas is Finally trending again lol. #2 isn't too bad for an Independent artist. Let's go Brandon!!!
🔥🔥🤩🔥🔥
I like tom macdonald  music and ik he knows  that ik that its all fine I understand now the f society sign for this i can do anything else this why i always leave on the third day after knotwho real is the problem here is the citizens not the country’s u like to hear nice things well this is the exchange i can do nothing else just feel again i lose it all but not cz of ppl on power but cz people care what others think and for that reason u will never enter to the world where life is free where everything is build just to enjoy the things u wish the most life is not short time is short so do ur best cz every second counts 🖖👽🫀
Liking it... that's right give the industry the double bird and make your music how you want and continue to succeed. I for one am sick of the garbage the industry turns out in all genres. They decide what our choices are without caring about what our preferences  are.
@Tom MacDonald I see your pattern, and I love it.
YEAH!!!!!🤘❤️‍🔥
This more of a nova flex, not tom. Nova snapped on this video
Haven’t even made it through the first verse but I already know this is straight 🔥. I love this!!!
Good song dude 👏
Yes a Christian singer called Carmen also created a song called riot go check it out
I see the visuals but where the bars for this hard has video?!? I felt let down
Great job! Love it! ❤️
Put this artist over 1 billion views. Good rhythm and lyrics,  support your independent creators and local businesses, power to tbe people and choke out the tired old way of doing things. The future is now
I've already commented but I just had to come back bcuz I forgot to add the most important thing to say; Thank you. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. From "Balloons" I can honestly tell this isn't always easy for you. It isn't all sunshine and daisies. So thank you for pushing through those bad days/times so you can give out even more good days to ppl who truly need you. I have to admit it sounds crazy for someone you've never ever met to mean so much to you, but I honestly don't know what I'd be doing to cope, without you and your music. Same with Nova. She has many talents but she can rap her ass off too, "Hey You" and "Problem" get me through some days as well. I'm not exaggerating when I say the majority of my music is you two. I'd send you a screenshot of I knew where or how to send it. And if I find out I still will lol. But anyway yeah, always a thank you is in order when you work as hard as you obviously do. Much 💕 HOG4LIFE
Loving the guitar 🎸
🔥❤
damm Tom this song is sick, love that guitar 🎸
This is fireeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee:)
Wow!! I am 87 years old and don't usually enjoy music like this but Tom is different!!!!!! Keep going brother!!!
its 99 cents to buy on itunes. Buy this amazing song. Support an amazing musician!!!!!
TimCast (Tim Pool) has been shouting you out almost every podcast now! HOG🖤
Total stomper. The beats, lyrics and production was kick as#. Time to start including your mass listening base into your productions. Tours anytime soon?
Setting an example of excellence one track at a time.
I Love this
Stomp on the constitution? You're dead.  Remember that generic politician and totally not anyone in particular because that would be illegal.
NOVA ROCKS! Tom this is a hit. We need more people like this. Keep doing what you’re doing. God Bless!
Definitely not one of my favorites if I am going to be honest. Love his music though. Make more like the system, names, brainwashed, snowflakes, etc
👍👍👍
"Another One"
@tom macdonald,  I love this one, homie... like love love it.👊💥❤
🔥🔥🔥
I’m here because of Tim Pool. Not let down at all, great job Tom!
Hells yeah !!!!  Love it!!!! Tom and Nova you both are such talented artists yall are on another level....the video production is as badass as the music....thank yall for everything you do....love yalll....HOG forever!!!!!
Oh DAMN!!! This is some kind of genre all of its own!! I think I like it!!!!
Dude I love this, keep it up!
addicted...this is hauntingly good. look at our boy trending #2 (as of now) as he rightfully deserves. new levels of respect. #HOG4LIFE
BRO I THINK HE JUST CALLED OUT THOSE LITTLE CHOCOLATE CANDIES THAT MELT IN YOUR MOUTH NOT IN YOUR HAND.
Man. Love Tom and his messages but damn. His quality had been degrading. This is just Meh, like 3 of the last 7.   I know he has the skills to make pure magic but he’s just been falling short imho. Gotta get away from the vein of the mainstream bullshit. It’s too close and that shit is fucking trash. He needs to bring some straight flow and better production reminiscent of: Danger Doom, Lyrics Born, Blackstar, Deltron or even Action Bronson. The mainstream repetitive production is Soooooooooo tired.
Great job Tom and Nova! Y’all killed it again! Keep grinding, folks are noticing and the mainstream doesn’t like it.
Just great. Guitars on the track. Perfect. Modern genius
Definitely best song in awhile
Hit the like button before the video even loaded up glad I did best artist out there.
#2 on trending! What a banger guys.
But why edited though??? That's so wrong. Is it youtube that's censoring you??🤔😔
Really not a fan of the satanic video but cool song
Totally Dope Tom, another awesome video.   Hooyah
Shout out to Tim Pool for sending everyone here to support! "Stop giving money to people who hate you"
A little short but I dig the different pace.
God damn!!!!!! Fire 🔥 📛
Im a miracle lyrical spiritual cynical minimal spiritual lyrical miracle
Like the switch up. Love the blend of rock/rap blend. Dope song for sure
Not my favorite, maybe, but still good.
Might be the worst rapper of all time
Thomas!!! U fking rock!
LFG #2 ON CHARTS CANT STOP HOG
A head banger with intense visual effects. This is awesome Tom. Definitely worth the wait
This 100% needs a mean guitar solo at the end Tom
🔥🔥🔥
I’m keen for tom to embrace some ghost mane style
Tom SMACKdonald another banger dude
🖤
Better CGI than She-Hulk
Love the Production, sounds clean
Oohhh' yessir finally!!! Tom went off 📴 Loving this one homie 💯🔥🎨🎶😎👊 respect 💞🌎😂🤣 how long did it take to come out with... 'that is a underground rapper' 😂🤣 NICE flow's
I can't wait to see a behind the scenes making of this video!  Unbelievable 😍
😆, have you lost your touch? This is wack! It sounds shit 🤣
INDPENDENT NOT DEPENDENT
TIM POOL member supporting you~! I want to see all of you in suits ~LMAO.
On 🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 as always!!  Video is the 💣💥
IM LOVIN IT, CALLING OUT HATERS AND THEY STILL CAN'T HELP THEMSELVES. KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK. 👍
Mabey it's just me but not a fan of this song but alot of his songs I like this one is kinda meh
This is cool 😍
Awesome as always Tom. I got admit I heard the chug of a guitar and I thought you were dropping a metal album! I’d listen the shit out of that.
Bought this today in the itunes store! Fuckin' Fire
The Friday release god has spoken. Numbers don't lie !!
Love it bro amazing as usual! ☺💖
No longer available through Amazon app?!
Awesome Song and Awesome video.  Well done Tom , Nova and Jared.
Bruuuuuuuuuuh this BEAT IS making me FCKN CRAZY 😈😈😈😈😈🔥🔥🔥🔥🤘🏾🤘🏾
Tim Pool gave you a great shout out.  Told his viewers if they get you to #1 he would wear a suit on his show. Another good song Tom.  Thank you to you and Nova.  Blessings
tommy boy has this distinct song layout in every song
How are you capable of putting out so much music? Not just music but amazing music.
Murdered him
I'm not the fan boy type, but I for real love you bro. Keep killing it, be a voice for change
Anyone who's listening for the first time, do yourself a favor and listen to more of his songs. Will quickly become your favorite rapper. 🤘
Dark sounding but still another on my favorite list
Damn this is good..
YouTube doesn’t recommend his videos but recommends reaction videos to it, funny how that works
Love your music, just wish you'd stop releasing it censored!  Sounds a little less badass when the "bad" words are censored, worried about young children hearing those words in this day and age is ignorant to say the least!
really like the instrumental and djent riff
Comment from Campbell River BC, Vancouver Island. Fuckin eh, son. Fuckin eh.
You make great music.  I just don't find the appearance worthy. To each their own tho.
Like, Share, Link believe it or not this is our Power. If there was a time to not give a shit about what others think it's now. Do your part you little piece of sand, become a cement block. Do your part you insect, it's time to infest
This song is just pure fucking fire. The anger ...along with the metal guitar is just perfect with the vibe and the lyrics.
This is a visual masterpiece
Damn this is fire 🔥
Tim Pool + Tom Mcdonald= Awesome!!!!
“I ain’t gonna chill, homie. What now? I’m still the biggest, sit the f🤐ck down!” and “I’ll put you six feet deep, that’s an underground rapper”   🔥🔥🔥🚒🚒🚒
the underground rapper line is fire tom. banger
Wow! Wow! Wow! Another great one!
awesome
For the algorithm
Cricket chirps need quantized my dude
Dope ass song my guy. I jam your music all the time.
Yo Tom, that shit was straight Fire my brother!  The skulls flying round was just sick.  Keep ‘em coming, totally awesome.  Added to the playlist for the ride to work!
Hi I just came here from tik tok 🤪

🤘
Great Vid!!!!   Props to Nova!!!!
sounds like a good guy and good song just a little hardcore
As a fan of Tom Macdonald, and Tim Pool, it was cool to see Tim shout out this song on his show tonight. When are you gonna do his show Tom?
That guitar riff is on point with the vibe.  Great job yet again!
This shit is 🔥🔥 Tom always changes his style .. love it  I Never get bored
Trump should use this as the opening song at his rallies. Banger song Tom, keep killing it.
Tom can take down the music industry  Nova can take down hollywood
FIRE BRUH
Sorry, appreciate the passion but this music is garbage. The whole genre is garbage. Bros just can’t stop flexin’. Quit hyping yourself and hype others.
Full send…
Damn.. What is this. 2.5 mins? Filled with repeat. Sighhh. I guess I'll go back to "this house"
Broooo get a new sound. Change it up. Sooo tired of the autotune. Love you Tom 😘
Time to get #1 Tom Is back!
Your New release.... Phenom
I feel bad and guilty and ashamed that I was a huge fan and almost obsessed with nova and Tom for over a year and could not and would not tell people about him because I come from a very poor fam and little town there for many liberals and dems just wanting those food stamps to keep coming.  Talk about one issue voting right   But I took a chance and when I got to see my brother for the first in a long time I told him to put on people r stupid by Tom.  My bro was shocked. I loved the react and we rocked some Tom for the rest of the night and still had plenty more for him to discover.  He told me I been away from. Home to long.  Ya they wanted the food stamps back in my home town but they were also hard working common sense people and he was going to put t ur on on the stereo at the sheet metal ware house he worked the next day.  This is in Montana where we r always late for the party but Matt said at least 90% of his co workers asked for the artist and loved it
I expected something harder
I simply respect you because we're the same Tom!!
Came here because tim pool said I should.
I like that distorted guitar.
Whadda really cool original and very unique song. I enjoyed that.
Wow, great song and props to Nova for the video!!!
👏👏👏👏🤘
This man's single is bigger than the queen's passing
10,000 🔥 emoji’s KILLED IT
I have never subcribed(sp?) to anyone before. Nova, you and the gang are killing it. Not my favorite and kind of short but i love it. JOE FROM DOVER out
Let's go dude! The instrumental in this slaps and love the flow. You killed it
Get er done ole son...
Mans song is on 2nd on trending. He's insane
This is one bad ass song I love it.of  course I love all your music  ❤
Been watching all day ❤️ an already rewatching.
New vid like every couple weeks,.  Gaining momentum.  Tons of songs. Love where it's coming from and where it's headed.  Whiteboyz , Names , Greenday, among my favorites.  Keep them coming.....
Guys - don't forget to *HIT THE LIKE* 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻  *SHOW* the algorithm we've had enough of the bs - real hip hop is *BACK*
Another Banger Tom! Keep up the great work, the greatest independent rapper of our time!
You truly are the shit, Tom! Love your music
And you did it again another banger great song thank you for sharing your talent with us
#2 om trending. Make sure yall like and comment for the algorithm. I follow tom and didn't get recommended this video. I searched his channel which i do EVERY FRIDAY.
Trash
“You don’t want this action, put you 6 feet deep, that’s an underground rapper” who tf is he goin at??? That’s hard af
Good shit brother, excellence as always. For the algorithm!
Calhoun, McDonald drop same day…. 👀 🤔 Is this song about….
🥄☕️
Biggest independent for my age.  Who and at what age had been bigger ?
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Winning back the culture - one SMASH at a time 🍻
Somehow I think this is aimed at a certain someone who had a clown series. 🤡.  Lol. Went at Tom , NLS and Stevie k.. among others . And it didn't do well for said person.  A whole week on Tom's nuts 😄😄and couldn't break 10k views.. if this is who it's aimed at Tom.. I ain't gonna name drop the said person.  Just know this is an awesome response if I'm right . All around production of this , beat , lyric structure,  visual.. it's pure 🔥
Of course nothing has tried loading all night I have 5G and this video just wants to load….hmm censored much 🤬🤬
Sound is fire
Def different.  👍🏻
:)
Awesome
Umm. Meh it was ok.
“Put you six feet deep that’s an underground rapper” damn
I love his music but lately it is a repeat of the same. Like when he buttholes and wish and several others they were different. But most of his songs now are just the same thing repackaged. The videos are beautiful and I do love the message. Just want something new.
This is the Taco bell of hip-hop
ANOTHER GREAT JOB.
Tom, I have now made you an unofficial Ranger.  Rangers lead the way.
I love this! Awesome upgrade on the vid. I ain't gonna lie, I'm one of those that get excited. This dragon is growing big.
What Tom and Nova are doing is revolutionary. There is over half a million views on this video after only 9 hrs. If you appreciate what they are doing you need to give it the thumbs up. I don’t know about you but I am tired of the woke,  elites, frankly anyone telling me how I should think and live. If you agree you need to promote the content that lifts up liberty, unity, and individuality.
no one knows your name that's why you always gotta name drop Wow that's dope!
HHHAHAHA TOMS #2 AND THE DEAD QUEENS #3 ON TRENDING
Amazing like always. Idk how you all do it. 🔥🔥🔥
https://youtu.be/phITnLWmqDc
Tom keeps getting better and better
As a metalhead I approve.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤❤❤
I mean what can you say besides 💯❤‍🔥
🔥
He the best rapper and he my everything his songs make my day
Banger🔥🔥🔥🔥
Always fire 💯
In real time, we are witnessing the emergence of a new, generational “counter culture”. I can literally feel the energy shifting like tectonic plates, as popular culture is being legitimately challenged by politically based, independent artists and creators like Tom.   My Advice: Know where you were and how you contributed to this moment in history. Go and PURCHASE this song. Nothing but Billboard Charts from here on out fam!! ❤️🙌🏼
Video production goes up but I'm watching song quality and depth go down... Just seems like a hook on repeat now with some mad crazy visuals.... I'm in it for the music not the videos. Come on bro.... Your focus is shifting
Too good HOG love ya work .
ALL AMERICANS SHOULD BUY THIS SONG. SUPPORT FREEDOM LOVING CREATORS.
Tim will be wearing a suit soon 😂
Bro go on Tim Pool already please for Christ Sake, god damn MFer GO Wtf are you waiting for
Timcast brought me here
Tom this is great. The beat, lyrics, flow, especially the production on the music video is immaculate.
Plot twist. Song is about Trump and his rallies
Hi Tom & Nova! Just a nobody middle-aged woman in the US here. I’m anything but cool. I went back to my corporate office job today as they decided to allow non-vaxxed to come in with a mask. I bought a lot of your CDs and found you while feeling so isolated and demonized for not “falling in line”….almost lost my job….was brave enough to say “no” anyway. I listened to your CD on the way into the office and back home today. I might not be cool, but I felt like a total winning bad ass today listening to you and finally being allowed back in my office without a vax. Thank you and know that your music makes a difference to so many.
You got a huge shoutout from Tim Pool over at @timcast today talking you up!
That GUITAR 🎸 is dope. Whole song is fire. 💪❤️🤝🙏 Much love on this one!
Tom Mcdonald can't be stopped hit after hit one amazing person
OH SHIT!!! is that epic guitar riff coming of that guitar your dad gave/made you?!?!?!?!!? HOLY CRAP!!!
No sir I don't like it.
❤️
Oh heck yeah..... this one was a "riot" 😉👍✌️😍🤙
I'm old as I'll be 60 in just a few days and I never thought I would be into hip-hop, but there are some greats such as Shai Linne. However I really love the stuff Tom does, especially since every time I hear him do a song I think there is nowhere for him to go from here. Yet everytime he releases something new I'm blown away! I personally like this song the best, but that's just my choice and now I will go download it from YouTube music, PEACE!
Never disappoints in the depth of the message. Great visuals as usual.  What a team!
Update rumble bro
lol i love Tom and agree with most of what he raps about but Tom, youre still underground. Its better that way tho
Did it again my man much love
“Blessed” & putting up the praying head in the video but has an upside down cross on the ski mask & upside down cross tattoo… 🤔
They're videos are just getting better his girlfriend is getting really good at what she does HoHoHo 👍
So who's this about
Hey , Tom this one is a totally different sound altogether,  just showing your multitasking is on point...NEVER STAYING COMFORTABLE...CHANGING UP , BUT STILL THE SAME.... SHOUT OUT TO NOVA TO....
OMFG ❤️ This song makes me feel POWERFUL and forget the shit stuff ❤️
wow who in the world is this?? Song goes harrdd
@Tom any specific target for this song? Love your stuff an you have a reason for everything you do. Just curious from Maine.
Nice... awesome video. Hella nice graphics.
Have to be honest, I am 53 and was never a huge rap fan, but you have changed that.  Cannot get enough of your songs and ability to just speak the truth and sing what you want vs what “they” want.  You inspire so many by not giving into the industry and system. You and Nova are absolutely killing it.  Huge fan…love supporting you both. Never stop speaking TRUTH, it’s what the World needs. Btw…love the beats, riff, song and video.  Amazing!!!!
feels a bit lower than the other music you've made, feels more like shock value with a mid hook than anything that posts the views of the artist, skill ur other music ain't bad I like snowflakes the best
Tom macdonald spitting another 🔥 banger hell yeah dude! 🤘🤘
ill take that sick ass jacket lol
Shared to my fb and my snap
Wish this song was longer.  It sure does rock.

That Jacket nearly stole the show!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👑
Tom killin it
Hey Tom.  Are you shadow banned. I have notifications on. And specifically check up on your channel yesterday to make sure I would be notified.  Who have you pissed off to get shadow banned?  Does anyone else have issues getting notified of new content?
I'm not a hip hop fan but I like that heavy metal guitar riff.
Keep doing what you are doing!!
Hey Tom can you make another song with nova? Her voice is awesome. And In my option she need more credits. I want to hear her rapping. I know she can do it.
No one plays the victim like MAGA McDonald the clown.  Who's is going to tell him that selling American patriotism aka Christian Nationalism aka Nat C ism - IS mainstream?  Being a Nat C is mainstream in white America.
WTF 😳🤯🧠
Pft, I love this dude.  Don't know why I keep being surprised by his releases.
Visual’s are dope as Fk!!
Tom still be coming with that fire man
Dope
love it...
random idea. since you and jordan peterson are Canadian and are sort of fighting the same fight, i feel like it would be fkin amazing if you two had an interview. I know hes super intelligent. but you both are from canada fighting the good fight. and that alone is worth a show with the both of you.
Just waiting for Tim to announce Tom as head of Timcast music productions
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yo tom I like your song's bro keep the great work bro🎧😁
Riot power
When’s the tour!?
I only do dope shit..😄 cool
My biggest problem with this song is that it’s too short haha.  I was hoping you’d let the beat marinate a bit mannn
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Unreal effects and song.
he said he hates pop but then says he’s a pop star. I’m confused. they did the quiet thing too many times to take this seriously. production was lame.
Hell yeah #2 on trending. Also cool people like Tim Pool shouting Tom out. Buy this song help Tom be #1 it's only $1
Bad fkn ass...  awesome video. Much love...

Tom it's just so powerful man x
Straight fire as always. Love your music
Tom MacDonald you are a absolute genius my friend keep them comeing brother
Help me out people. I am falling off the Hangover train. I'm finding to many things being reused in his music. I get it that he is independent, that wrenches teeth are becoming rounded off.
My man Tom delivering the fire as usual! 🤘🏻💪🏻🔥🇨🇦🇺🇸
Goddamn 🐐
Best video yet.   I love the guitar chords
This is good and such a creative video!,
Even if I never made a dollar again I'm blessed Never stop, givin' em bops, white Pac in the flesh Oh yes Shovel rocks in my coffin, tell the cops that I'm dead No stress Hundred thousand fans coming to cut off your head Slow death Most illest singer, both middle fingers Throw 'em in the air I don't care till I'm a ghost or I'm crippled I ain't gon' chill, homie sit down I am still the biggest, who the bitch now? I am independent You are bitter and pathetic When it's up, then it's up, then it's up, come and get down [Chorus] Everywhere I goes a riot People cryin' Everywhere you go is silent Why so quiet? I show up and it's a riot They excited Where you going? I feel like it Why so quiet?  [Verse 2] Even if I never made a dollar again I'm blessed Never stop, givin' em bops, white Pac in the flesh Oh yes Till I'm dead I swear to God I'll do it my way Grindin' out my life, now everyday is Friday Independent legend, unheard of at my age Middle finger flippin', got scribbles on my face I will not go mainstream, dawg you know I hate pop I'll be screamin' "fuck the industry" until my veins pop That's a fake watch Your whole gang opps Ain't the same, stop No one knows y'all name, that's why you always gotta name drop Most illest singer, both middle fingers Throw 'em in the air I don't care till I'm a ghost or I'm crippled I ain't gon' chill, homie what now? I am still the biggest, sit the fuck down I am under independent, Mount Rushmore You are a fucking nobody, a legit clown [Chorus] Everywhere I goes a riot People cryin' Everywhere you go is silent Why so quiet? I show up and it's a riot They excited Where you going? I feel like it Why so quiet?  [Bridge] I only do dope shit, so sick Homie why you cappin? I'm a popstar, rockstar you a never has been I do big things, wrist bling You don't want this action Put you six feet deep, that's an underground rapper  [Chorus] Everywhere I goes a riot People cryin' Everywhere you go is silent Why so quiet? I show up and it's a riot They excited Where you going? I feel like it Why so quiet?
big fan but why the upside down cross on the mask?
Whoo!!! The visuals though!
HOG for life!!!
Absolutely love this man! All the stuff u drop is 100% FACTS! Keep kicking the industry’s ass!!! ❤️
Tom I would love to see you do a song with Tim Pool. You two are both keeping the independent music alive at this point. You guys tag team a song dissing the corruption of the music industry and really go hard on it, that would be incredible.
YES.....   Just yes :)
😱😱💥💥💥💥💥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Trending # 2. Wow!!
The video was awesome but the lyrics felt low effort. I wonder if Tom is having some life troubles?
Liberalism is a mental disorder.
Friday belongs to Tom MacDonald!!   Watching Tom grow over the past years has been so rad. He deserves every ounce of love & respect that he gets. Keep moving forward!!    🏴‍☠️H.O.G. ⚔LIFE🏴‍☠️
Gee I wonder how this didn't show up in my recommended all day. Thanks Tim Pool
for algorithm
I ALWAYS look forward to hearing your next hit brother. 100% keep dropping truth my friends
Damn #Nova! 💯✊
I hold Tom to a higher standard and this is wicked good its a new way
🔥
Tom McDonald 💯🔥
#TomMacDonald keeps leveling up 💯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Tom you the devil and you know it. You so scary bro. spirit of the world feels good for a little while my man till you get old and can't sleep, lose your fountain and the lightning in your eyes fade bro. Fallen like Cain, prophet of death my main man you sad I'm broke in my soul for you cause soon enough outer darkness gonna show up in your open visions and it's so wide you can't look up or down, black pupils of the Creator staring you down from every direction crush you like a tin can, you a tin man, no heart left the self is a bad man. Satan is the enemy, you and me, dangerous by our understanding about the nothing. Long road from here, take some time in the 90s let the prophets of the latter years bring you some humility. Maybe the King of the Universe will show you His infinite mercy. Repentance is what I long for when I listen to your long form diatribes and I hear the broken record of mankind again its all the same pride, your independent bragging is a damn lie.
Trash
Fire as always tom 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Good shit keep up the grind man it will pay off in the end. Keep spreading the message

🤢
Sorry bud, I can barely buy lights...or bread. Ty though 💯
I enjoy Tom Mac's older music: Wheels Keep Turnin', Who I Am,  Castles, Wanna Be. His newer music is cool, but just doesn't vibe the same. Good job inserting all that CGI into this video.
Bro that shit was Fire 🔥
Tom spit that shit! Damn I swear I listen to your music religiously! You and Nova and Evan are absolutely stupid AMAZING! YOU Deserve everything you got and get! I love you guys! Keep doing what you do please! Much love! You guys are so Talented! Much love Tom, Nova! Stupid amazing!
Dude… I bought the song on iTunes before I heard it. It was everything and more I thought it’d be. And the vid was gold👌🏼
Let's wake up and be what we are to be. Stop being quiet and rise to your own status in love. You are talented Tom, along with your crew. Great job 💖
Tom, I can only shake my head and smile. The growth of you and Nova as artists is awe inspiring and brings a true smile to my face. Y'all keep killing it and PLEASE don't ever stop. The song slaps the ever-loving sh*t out of everything out right now and this video smashes. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
HOLY SHI* HOG... You just stepped into the next level of production while keeping the lyrics like always FIRE 🔥. NOVA the video is amazing need to be seen on the biggest screen you can watch from... KEEP THE BEATS COMING,  WE NEED MORE!!!! IF I wasn't clear enough GREAT WORK HOG!!

Your best song is still "corny"   I love that shit bro 😂😂
Love it
I love everything this guy does, and the fact that he operates TOTALLY independent from concept to finished product there is ZERO outside influence nd artistic contamination..  His gang is the ESSENCE of independence.  For that reason alone we should ALL buy into his art every chance we get.
Tom you killed it again 😍. HOG forever!!! ✌️❤️
Wow! This is shit!
Another insane video thanks man
Fuck yeah!!
I absolutely love it brother love everything about it.
#2 trending. Let's go!
#2 on trending in just 9 hours. Absolutely mind blowing music bro. Youve proven yourself again and again. Without anything to prove. Lol dude is a category of his own, love you fam
sending out good energy to everyone in the world that's trying to make a difference for the good of all humanity this is the future and this is the time now to make the difference for all
Awesome some and really cool video! 👍🏻❤️
Wow Tom we were waiting for you to create a new masterpiece . And you didnt disappoint us. And this video kicks arse
I'm a fan and everything, have almost all his cds and some merch. But why do I feel like I'm the only one who isn't isn't fan of this song? It's good, just not like a "don't look down" or "naked" kind of good. Idk maybe it's just me. I'll go listen to the "Mac lethal diss part 2"
🔥🔥🤯🤒🥶🤣 This song is everything! Crickets bro! Crickets! I love it!
At work in my office jamming on a Friday night
Loved the new song!! Hell yeah!! 😊
Love how the visuals are so dark and threatening but the song is actually kinda of a laid back groove. Really good guys. 🔥
Tom has found a way to make great rap tunes with awesome lyrics, not the usual drugs, guns, money or bitches, he says some of the best things in his songs
Time to stir up some controversy with a leftist rapper.  Need some more heat. Not gonna lie this track was kind of weak.  You could always do an FBI vid.  That would pop off!!! You gotta talk about more than you bud.  I love most of your older work because you had a msg.  Now it feels watered down. Just my honest opinion.
Loved to see Tom on timcast IRL podcast
Who he talkin about??
Every new song I ask myself there’s no way he can top this and then 🤷‍♂️
Cross of St Peter?!!
Tough. Big up bro
If just one of my song's can even be half as good as this then i'll consider it a win.
Bro GOTTA say this one is EXTREMELY more refreshing then the last few blowing out the left and right in the WORLD. I STILL love them but this one revolves around you more specifically than the comings and going of the political sides....Good one
Gotta make a song about how our thoughts create our reality. Science proved we're all vibrating & our vibrations all derive from the thoughts in our heads. How you could help so many people discover the truth behind how their thinking is shaping their lives & influencing the lives of the people and environment around them.
Oh my god the visuals! This was absolutely incredible
You a never has been, tomorrows yesterday
Keep the Faith of Truth in you Music Tom and we'll be Listening. God bless you and Nova and the rest of your wonderful family. Amen.
I didn't think much about this drop till I took it home and put it thru my 500 watt stereo system. Now I like it. Yamaha 1020 did the trick.
Love it!!!!
🗑🗑🗑🗑
This is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The guitar rift though. This shit fire!
Q
great song trigger more leftists
Whoa!!! This beat and arrangement is on another level!! Well done Tom!!!
That may be one of the most bad ass music videos I've ever seen. 🔥🔥🔥🤯🤯
no notifications again imagine that... THANKS YOUTUBE
🔥
58 and love his music 🎼 🎵 🎶 ♥️♥️♥️♥️
Crickets
Another ripper song love ya work Tom
Running out of targets?
Tom, you’re #1. So called rating agencies are out of touch & biased.
Nice work
This song is siiiiiiiccccccckkkkkkk!!!! And the video is crazy awesome! Great job Nova!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Production level is too damn high. Good stuff.
Amazing job my babies!!!!! Love it Did Nova do the background graphics or was it a family thing?
The Queen would have loved this
"Put you six feet deep that's a underground rapper" bar of the month!
COMING DOWN TO THE RING!!! COMING FROM YO MAMAS HOUSE! WEIGHTING IN AT NONE YOUR DAMN BUSINESS!!  NUMBER 1 CONTENDER! FOR THE CHAMPIONSHIP BELT!  TOM MACDONALD!!!🥳🥳
Damn it! I tried to ask you about your favorite VSTs in the AMA on instagram but you never got to my questions but This beat is UN-FUCKIN-BELIEVABLE!  And as for the "White Pac In The Flesh" line.... FACTS! 🔥🔥🔥
Killin It
I'm 40 years old, I remember when the idea of "music videos" started out.  This was visually amazing.  Up there with TOOL or Gorillaz as far as the production goes.  Good fucken job.  Keep kicking that info out too.  It goes a long ass way to reach folks that may not understand the world of politics.
Just a reminder that Rolling Stones Magazine put "Fake Woke" as one of the worst songs of 2021. Think RSM will be honest this time and make Tom (and Nova) #1 hot new artist?
Can’t wait to see crypt’s “dId ToM MaCdOnALd DisS mE” reaction to this
Nice work TM&NM... and to the VFX guru too... ✌️
I love seeing Democrat ads before my Tim McD. Vids
I love how YouTube tried hiding this. Even though i subscribe. Tom keep doing you!!!
Damn Tom and Nova freaking banger
I, for one, am happy to have waited so long for this masterpiece
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
You make all our veins pop sir. #HOG
Shhhh...
Typically not a fan of this style of music. Tom is the exception! Awesome and awesome message! Will purchase!
Not a bad guitar tone there, bit more guitar work and I might even find myself a fan.  I'm a fan of the lyrics even if the music is not my thing.
Who did you wrong @Tom Macdonald?
Dope song
Yeah it's cool
Fking done it again Tom & Nova, this video and tune bangs 🔥. Blessings from across the pond, Scotland. 🙏 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 ✌️
Shout out to timcast!  Promote the counter culture.
THE SONG WAS AWESOME!! But The EFFECTS.... Nova Girl You ROCK!!! This video kicked ass! Loved the eyes, smoke, flying bones... THIS WAS LIT!! Beautiful!! Standing on a pile of skulls? Genius. Pure Genius. Showing REAL flexed muscles? AGAIN Beautiful. Genius.
Where tf do I get a jacket like this tho?!
Friday is most definitely tom day love it brother
💥💥💥
Best one yet Tom! Nova BOOM 🤯
Gibberish
Never heard of this artist before and its not really my style but something about it kept me listening to the end. Man definitely is going places.
Again another 🔥🔥but I expected nothing less man much respect keep putting out that musical magic
Tom that was lit..Video was so fire mad props to Nova Rockefeller 🙌  number 2 on trending!
Damn Mr. Tom that is fire brother always love your stuff
BANGER!!!!!
WoW!!! CGI and another totally professional production! CONGRATULATIONS!!! You’ve got the goods on every other artist, regardless of genre. Being 100% independent gives you a MARVELOUS ADVANTAGE. Keep showing up the entertainment industry. I’m sure you can cross over into movies. Are you producing fellow musicians, yet? If you need writers, lyrics/movie scripts, I’ll be in touch. I could use the income. ❤️🤓🙌🏻👍🏻
I used to listen to edited music.... then I turned 12. WTF! 🤣
Love the CRICKETS!  You go Tom &  Nova!
dope AF
How does Nova Rockefeller come up with these ideas?!! Pure talent 👏 ✨️ 👌
Ok I gotta say this. His hair is smoking in this video and it reminded me of how the Most feared Pirate Black Bears would set his hair on fire during raids. Your welcome lol
Freaking love it  !!
With great power comes great responsibility Tom use this wisely. They will come for us all one-day but we are in the know now.  FJB
You go Tom!!!!!!
I'm 54, more a Rock guy but MAN! Tom's music is REALLY GOOD!
"Put you 6 feet deep as an underground rapper"  - GOLD!!!!
Love Tom, Banging graphics Nova!!!
#2 on trending Tom is out trending the queen 👸 wtf!   Yes!
The effects on this one were a major step up.  Very nice.  🤌
Fact: the liberals are more concerned with the well being and welfare of criminals, than they are of the victims.
Hell yeah!!! Let's get it this is gonna be on repeat
Meh
yessir, and another one hits.
Y'all....please buy Tom's album! It's the only way we keep him relevant and shove the truth up the ass of every woke c*NT!
Amazing Tom McDonald as always ❤️  I love the music an the video
Wow, the cricket chirping gave the beat...nice!
#2 on all trending??
ALWAYS brings the bangers!!!💯🔥🔥🔥
Amazing!!!🤘,🤟
I love metal Tom
Not my cup of tea but I respect what he's doing. Watched the video, bought the tune
We needed this. We needed to hear you talk some shit. Do ya thing dude.
First U say you hate pop,next verse you call yourself a popstar
a little less auto-tune would be nice
The man did it again! 🙌🏼🙌🏼
Best jacket of 2022 award goes to Tom McDonald. What a kickass song man really like this one definitely gonna jam this alot
Shit is Cringe 🤣
i like it i love the bass to it goes hard bro
🔥 Loved it Tom, and Nova outdid herself. She always seems to! Mad props to Jared also! Much love, fam. 🔥
EPIC!!!!
Like The BOSS you are tom.... this song is awesome, thank you tom. Nova, that camera work is on point too... from shake to dead still on that line " why so quiet".... well done to you both for another epic production.
It's like getting a gift in my inbox right when I could use one. Solid vocals & lyrics. And Nova going 2.0 with the added CGI. Always puts me in my happy place.  Thank you for releasing this video.
You are the greatest independent artist on earth 🌎
Wow Awesome ! I Love it .... your 55 year old fan , well I’m 56 now .
😰😱💀👻...
love you bro, getting tired of those repetitive chorus's tho. formula must work, but still. need a lot more shit in between chorus's yo. lol
Another great song and visuals! Kudos to Nova and the whole family, loves to all ♥️😎
#1 let’s go!!! I’m buying the song
Good job.
You always 1up everybody. You and nova on another level. 😮
I just really wish somebody would write his hooks. They're so fucking bad. They literally kill the momentum of the song and just fuck off shit that should be way better. Please someone help Tom McDonald out with the hooks. So many of my guys like his shit but say the same thing they can't rock out to it cuz it just gets killed by the hooks
It was okay.... Far to short!!! You need to step up your game bro. Give us an anthology in one track. 1hr long...
Never disappointed. 🤍
LETS GO!! Amazing as always. 🔥
Absolutely 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Hard work- dude's got some drive.
Boooom
I'm sorry Tom, I'm not crazy about this one. The auto tune doesn't do it for me at the end.
Damn! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is garbage. Who listens to this?
Awesome job Nova!
Love this! U killed it. 8 hours after release 448k views and #2 ON TRENDING! Get it!
Everything about this is dope
Wow 👏 love the video, Nova and the gang did a awesome job nice work
Awesome! Just fricking awesome!
Love the metal rifts in this.
It's crazy to see how far he's come, love you Tom!
Fire.
Tom never fails to make these true words into something incredible. May God bless you and your family tom. ❤
Holy crap!!!!!! 2 on trending😁🔥😁🔥

*Tim Pool in a PINK Dress,  Biatcchh.*
Our side riot we shock the world, leave us alone, Y'all commies been warned.
I love it when you go HEAVY 🤘🤘🤘🤘
Let’s gooooooooo
Great Music 🎶 🎵 🔥🔥
Since I found you, Everyone and their mother started listening to your music.  Weather they listen to rap or not, no matter their walk of life, your music resonates with them. it's been a real honor to watch your journey to the top as an independent artist. You're nothing short of an inspiration.
you and ACaL release at the same time...both of you never disappoint it's awesome  ... dont tell Adam, but tbh I like your song more than his song (the ones released today)
Yo bn waitin so happy bout ur new drop
They keep saying thousands at left leaning and that the right is so minute that they’re wrong. But this song has hit trending #3. Fight back Americans, stand for your beliefs.
Pretty solid, but it's not going on my top list. Tom has too many songs I like more.
I love that all your videos are pure fire!!!  And so much love to NOVA <3
Tom macdonald and Chris webby are the only artists I'm excited to hear new music from. Bro keep doing your thing. And would love to see an appearance on Timcast since he's been trying to push your music up the charts. Would be an awesome conversation on culture.
Two minutes and thirty nine seconds of phukn fire...  Nova, over the top...
Thats why you always gotta name drop!!! Damn that is fire!!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Love the guitar 🎸 rips in this song the who song was bad ass. Tom Macdonald is one of the rarest rappers that every song he makes is a hit. Love Fridays when his new songs come out.
Not my favorite Tom tune from a pure musical standpoint. I think that might have to go to "this house" still - but the video is bad ass and amazing.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Now this I can get behind .. this the Tom we need n I missed
Way to go Nova....oh and tom too! 👏
Tom and Nova, WTF ? New song and I don't get notification from YT, I found out from Timcast IRL. I hate these YT people...... For what its worth, please BITCH at YT. I've already fired off my BITCH, not to sure if the BOTS are going to give a shit. BTW: Loving the new music my friend. Shout-Out to Timcast IRL. Tim ! We heard you and hell yes we Love Tom MacDonald. LETS GET HIS ASS TO #1 AND KEEP HIM THEIR........
I like that metal guitar 🎸
he is a prophet for such a time AS THIS...Rappers the devil hit you real hard and you sold your souls to the devil
Love it
Awesome as usual!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀
Not exactly what I thought was going to come out with the name riot. But dam this was much better than what I could have imagined anyway. Well done mate. You have released another banger.
this one a banger
I dig everything he raps about in all his songs... But they just never Sound..GOOD 🤷🏽‍♂️
Based
My mind is blown! 😁🧿🧿🧿🧿🧿🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️❤️🧿🧿🧿🧿⚔️
This is his best track in my opinion mainly ‘cause I’m a metal head
I like the heavy guitar riff.
Jesus christ. Imma buy this song. This thing is nasty
As part of my work Im staying indie, I'll make my own company if I must before joining a mainstream triple A or software company.
All I can see is you and Ronnie radkie track!!! This is a bad ass song been jamming it all day!
Damnnnnn bro this the most different shit you dropped in a  minute you and Nova did it on this one...love it my new favorite
I don't wanna lie to you, I had higher hopes for a song titled "Riot". Didn't exactly go the way I had expected.
What's up with the inverted cross on your ski mask?
WHAT A SLAP SONG AGAIN!!! KILLING IT MAN.
This the best one yet and it be true so true  you the number 1 dude you have no idea how good you are I love you and your music so much your the bro
I love that you're real!
Great song and video!! I don't know who Tom is referring to, but Damn!! Straight between the eyes!!
Man and that hat along with YouTube just made my day! I love it!🎶🎤😎♥️
Please tour
YES YES YES!
Another one to play way to loud because no one is listening...... Friday its your day ........ty tom n nove......... Maine U.S.A

Thats what im talking boooouuuutttt
Fucking sick man keep it up fuck the haters and cancel culture
Buy it on iTunes. Now.  Each purchase counts as ~ 150 views! We going to #1 baby! 🥇🏆
Fam…seven hours in and we have #3 on iTunes Charts for all genres, and #3 trending for YouTube. That seems like a riot to me 🤟. Loved the banging beat in The System, the violin in Names, and I loved the guitar riffs in this. The beats are getting better and better each song you drop. Thank you for what you are giving us. Also, to Nova, with her award winning videography. Love y’all.  #hangovergang
So reminds me why I love rap. It's raw like rap used to be back in the day. Thank you for speaking..singing truth!
You are so talented!! Love your music and that truth you speak thru your music lyrics.  Many musicians do not have the balls to do what you do.  They have sold their souls to the devil 👿
Fuckin nailed it bro
All glory to Jesus of Nazareth
Killin it!
🙌
Thanks Tom ,for representing. TimCast sent me.
Killer music once again. I am a Rocker through and through but dam, I can not get enough of Toms music! The lyrics are second to none and catchy in every tune. Fan for life, keep it coming!!!
Straight BANGER
cringe
More please!! Lol
That's the Tom i know, Hit after hit, after hit. Keep doing your thing young man
Production value getting intense. Ol' Tom has made it and independently. Noice 👌
Tom McDonald just dissed the game for Eminem 🔥🔥🔥🔥
meh
Stand strong my man
Another great one from the best independent artist.  His music is far above the cookie cuter BS that the mainstream keeps pumping out.  Keep going strong, Tom!  Love your music.
Loved it as always Tom & Nova and fam
PROP THIS MAN UUPPP!!! 💯💯💯💯
Chica chica yeaaaa
Man Tom's come outta the gate hard af on this no way this isn't taking over hell yeah 🎉
Love what this guy is doing!!
Al Gore's Rythm. It adds fuel to his jet.
You were right, ain’t nobody fw this video, shits too 🔥
this was great 🔥🔥💯💯
OMG.....How do you keep getting better
#3 on trending let's hit #1 H.O.G. Instant fn banger ⚡🔥⚡🔥⚡
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Man that song gives me the chills!! What a badass son Tom!!! Love the metal added to this!
Tom, you should start signing other artists, dethrone Strange Music!
For some reason this feels like a half finished song to me - like there's an extended album version or something
Badass song AND video!!!
U Rock Brother!!!...
A new Tom Macdonald song out on my birthday?!?! This is the best present I’ve gotten today!
bro no way people actually enjoy tom macdonald
Man I hear Adam Calhoun all over this.
🗣🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Tom amazing switch up on the flow and to nova that's the most madass video as a artist myself I know the work you had to do to pull this off and mad respect
Go check my music out 🔥
Such a Banger!! Love this...one of my favorites!!
Love the effects!!
💐💐💐💐💐💐💐
he's definitely one of the rappers of all time
Need to get some Sith eye contacts and do some music like the Empire taking over.   And don't start singing about putting people 6 feet under. It's not becoming of you
I the the Nu Metal sound in this track
🔥 as always!
Better CGI than shehulk lol
Once again Nova truly knocks it out of the park. And Jared with his effects! 🔥Damn good song and video! God Bless Hang Over Gang!
This is fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
six feet under - underground rapper ...lol
HOOOOOLY SHIIIIT!!!
Big fan of Tom,  and I think if his music reaches enough people he can change the world. That being said,  this one just didn't do it for me. The auto-tune just kinda kills it. His unaltered voice, flow, and powerful, thought-provoking lyrics are what set him apart in the rap world, and this one just seems to blend in if you ask me.  But then again nobody asked me. Keep up the great work Tom 👍.
Unstoppable
Oh! And 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 I'm not a bot Bitches!!
Fuckin awesome as always good shit Tom visuals are sick
holy crap dude your trending number 4!!!!
While not my preferred genre of music, this song is a banger.
#4 on trending 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 F*CK YEAH TOM!!!
Yeah bro.. This song IS yhe riot! I love the hard beats! Oh, and Spielberg gon be tryin to call y'all bout these visuals dog. Much love #hogforever
I must have never seen it before if you flaunt it but really an upside down cross Tom? People can hate this comment talk shit if they want but you just lost a supporter who has purchased multiple CD's and t-shirts
HELL YEAH CRANK THAT SHIT!¡!!!
AMAZING I could listen to this on replay FOREVER! HOG So much said without any of that mumble crap, beautiful expression.. IMA CRY
One of my favs so far, damn good job
I chose to dislike this song because there is no reason you should step to their level in my opinion this song is stepping closer to their level don’t do it if all you’re hearing is silence is because you amaze do what you do to amaze don’t try to invoke him by stooping to their level you’re better than that
When is the tour
I'm just going to go share this now. Well fucking done Tom (and crew, that video was sick).
Such a banger 🔥🔥🔥🔥
This beat is straight 🔥
Love it!!  “Straight to your dome like whoa whoa whoa” point as always!  Thanks!!
this moe foe is the new standard get use to it dig deep let it roll brother
Bro this clip is giving me vibes of post apocalyptique beat them all game , i can defo see a kind of video game where tom is the main caracter kindov like infamous but you get to fight sjws and n4z1s and solve moral dilemmas in the missions and unlock his songs with boss battles like the ghost of racism or somethings of the sort , i'd buy it in a heartbeat just in case you wanna branch out thats a dope side project , look into the artist "Savant" he made a mini game of that sort showcasing his music
I'm not a fan of the sound mixing of this song. You don't stand out as much as you normally do and it has less of a punch. At least for me. It feels ummmm muddled. Normal i can listen to your tracks once and get all the feels. I had to replay it a few time.
This is the singer from the offspring in an alternate reality. Lovin it!! 👏
I'm just leaving some random fire emojis because this song is a banger and because algorithms 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Your white but i like. Your music more than eminem 10 years ago.. life.
Not what I was hoping for
Tom with another banging song brother why so quiet shit hub…killer video damn impressive good job nova
Fantastic! Song of the year!
i'll purchase riot shirt in one month o wait..
Another amazing video the bonenado is badass 🔥 🔥🔥🔥 song you all killed it again
its ok. i like the different style you think is progressing. but to say it. i think there are far more other songs i can think of is way better. hate to hate but brother you got to go harder. i love all your songs  but this one. it kinda has thrown me off
Underground RAPPPER me, You, u tryna takeova again??
I was head-bangin' to this beat! I love it, perfection once again! Thank you Tom & Nova! 🥰
👏👏Nobodies Bitch! = 💯💪You can feel the power EH!!!🙏.
Blessed he is.... GOD’S PEOPLE WIN ALL TIME!
AWSOMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE     !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
do one on upcoming november election hype bullshit and teachers thinking we dont notice them perving out our kids
I heard Tom Mac Donald and Ronnie Radke (and Falling in Reverse) were supposed to tour together right before the coof came around, I would have loved to see them both live. Great song and music video too by the way! Both Falling in Reverse and Tom Mac Donald always have top notch production in their music videos.
That beat is absolutely fucking nasty
One Word- DOPE
trash, releases the same 4 songs on rotation every year. just scroll through his catalogue, find a better artist and thank me later.
🤘
Best thing you have done since Dear Slim. Awesome Job.
We've missed ya!
“Your whole gang opps” is such a hard bar
Once again a song & video that is just freaking AWESOME!!!! You guys are killing it. Keep up the good work. I love listening to you and seeing what Nova come up with in the videos.  Love you guys man!
Tim sent me
🔥
Already gonna be blasting this while I am at work man. Sharing it everywhere I can
Love it.
For years I have listened to rap for a while and I love rap but when I listen to toms music I gives rap a different perspective of the rap world thanks for the new song tom and I hope you keep making music for the world to heard 🔥🔥😅
I gotta say, I like like all your songs, but this one is my new favorite
Tom the shadow goat that will rised up to be the goat
Awesome and hot.   Loved it!
KICK ASS song! And the CGI, GREAT JOB TOM!
Fucking straight banger.
Definitely not one of his best.
Solid Banger!
Was this at a specific rapper or just the typical trash industry ones?
Biggest underground independent rapper? Better do a fact check on that.
Tom I go to a Christian College where no one is Christian and I'm looked down on for being a free thinking man of God, I WILL NEVER BACK DOWN, LOVE YOUR MUSIC, HOG FOREVER 🤟🔥💯😝
NOVA... BONNIE TO TOMS CLYDE.. AMAZING VIDEO!! HOLY SHIT!!  GET YOURS GIRL...
Well you did it again love it thanks again you and never are great I'm glad you're not a sellout you keep it straight
Never heard of ya before. Saw a recommendation from Tim Pool. Song is 🔥 just bought it on iTunes.
hey look it's republican 6ix9ine
I don't know who "Jared" is, but you need to keep him in the shed out back for a while, the effects that dude produces are all kinds of on point
Well this song was a riot
❤️💪🏽
Fuckin banger been waiting too long for this,  The best part is, since people heard I'm HOG, I was abandoned by every friend I use to have, until H.O.G and Creek Squad accepted me.  H.O.G & Creek Squad for life 🙏🔥❤
Never disappointed. Can't wait to see you on the east coast Tom. Much love 🧡
Diss towards Grizzy?
Man I was hoping for a scathing condemnation of our out of control federal agencies and the tyrants in office
With all respect Tom, You had a better songs that that. I dont like it.
Came to YouTube just now on the chance Tom had a new track.  Score.  Thank you for making my day
Never fails. My 14 month old daughter didn't stop dancing the whole time. She loves this almost as much as me. Another fire track I been waiting for
Good shit like always!!!  Wanna thank Tim Pool. Even though I'm subbed it doesn't notify me when you upload. I saw you on his thumbnail and came right here!
You are amazing!
7hrs in & trending #4. Keep being you & doing you, the world needs it.
Dang! Tom MacDonald and Adam Calhoun dropping new music today? Is it Christmas? I must've missed the memo. Love it Tom and Nova! Keep doing what you do. And Jared, I don't know you yet but you keep doing visuals like this and you'll be a household name. Great job!!!  On another note, would you guys consider dropping the 'Merica merch again for Patriot Day? I missed out because I couldn't make up my mind fast enough. 😛God bless and HOG for life!
Your talking but not saying much. How bout talk about how the super rich are trying to kill the divide even more and put them in complete control.......
🔥 goat people hate the truth and I love it
Tom is smokin!
Damn man you once again are impressing my ear drums 🔥 damn nice track I’m loving the melody and bassline , hats off to your camp 🍻🔊🔊🔥
Doesn’t hold a match to ANYTHING Ryan Upchurch releases
Love the song ! I found out about you from Tim Poole’s show . Love to hear a ripping guitar solo in this song .
legendary freestyle 2->https://youtu.be/TuicMslyNs8
Appreciate you Tom!  You're amazing 👏 👏👏👏👏
Bro, you just made #MichealKnowles, and  #MattWalshes theme song/ intro song. This is even a good beat for the club/ mosh pit
Just who in the hell is he talking about specifically? Riots everywhere he’s at? Not likely. Lay low for a little while. You need more material. Every song, says the same thing, just different words.
You ain't change from it ... I'm still here and I'm holding you down.
Amen 🙏 brother

Listening to this at work an I got all my coworkers into your music (factory workers) we had a riot jamming out to this song. Love it
💯🙏🏻❤️🇨🇦🔥😎
Let's GO!!
Great track just too short!
Nova 🔥 concepts.. you did the cgi..@ tom  sit down and be humble.. as a independent got on tour!!!!!!!!!!
No notification, no recommendation, had to legit type the song in to find it. Youtube is big mad.
This song is amazing! I love all your music. Keep being amazing
We're ready when you are 😈
Dang dog... you just keep getting better and better.  I know that being an independent artist isn't easy but I know that all of us love ya for doing it.  Love your music and the message you put into your songs.  Oh and the video is awesome. Nova does such an amazing job. Love y'all
I give him mad respect because being a independent musician has to be hard.
Tom McDonald hope your doing good like the cool songs 🤯🤯🤯
🙌🥁🔥🔥🎶🎶
Mannnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn these songs just keep coming out better and better. Woooow man hellllllll yeah. Are you ever coming to Hershey Pennsylvania. Would want to see you in a concert. Keep it up   Love ittttttttt

Love it. Greetings from Germany. Its time you go international
Love the crickets
Love the new cgi work
Bringing it like always!!!
WoO!!!
Prof is better... hands down...
Epic song dude 🤙🏻
Video production is decent. Tried some different things sonically with the guitars. It's not bad. But sorry, try as I might he just doesn't stir anything in me. The crickets at the end are me, trying to care LOL.
Me stressing out wondering what tom will do if this song doesn't get 1 million views in 24 hours
Wow that was pretty good homie!!! Doing it without the labels!
Bro this track was 🔥 man thank you so much tom
Sounds a bit too familiar for me, I'm tired of guys rapping about themselves and how great they think they are. A little bit of praise and they mistake themselves for gods. Tom Your better than THAT my friend.
Awesome video
🔥🔥🔥
I love your truth and through your music you get out what most people want to say!
Almost 400k in 7 hours holy shit lol. Tom dope as always BUT I'm crediting nova more this time this video looks like some apocalypse movie or something. Very impressive cheers to tom and nova (it's just coffee) 🖤🤘
Tom hasn't got 2 middle fingers in the air, its more like 2,000,000 middle fingers in the air. Hangover game 4 life. Nova is blowing me away with her film skills. "#Put_the _New_WorldOut_Of_Order"
Facts
killin Tom. Love it!!
🔥🔥🔥 my favorite rapper u never disappoint
Tom MacDonald had a farm...
I think Kid Rock got Eminem pregnant and Tom is there offspring 💯🤣🤣🤣🤣🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
It was okay . You haven't done anything edgy in a while .
Thought you where canceled for the past month haven't seen anything from you just found out YouTube unsubscribed me.
I love this video and needed this today. Thank you!
Dope 😎
This is the best Tom song so far 🔥
Nova knocks it out of the park again....awesome affects!!   Tom slaying as usual, too!!
They're throttling you big time today.
Bro this song goes hard definitely going to be my favorite song
Powerful and beautiful! Poetry at best. ❤️
I’m a huge Tom Macdonald fan, Iv heard all his songs. But I have to admit, I had really high hopes and he dropped the ball with this one; respectfully.
I was wondering about the graphics you be adding now. Looks good. Keep it up Tom.
5 trending🔥🔥🔥🔥
Thus is Hard!!!! Tom 😳
Like usual I love it , keep being you. Thank you for all your music, love what y'all for what y'all do
Another banger. Keep it up Tom!
Tom never disappoints
Thanks for never turning your life over to the labels and industry
Leveled up!!
Hangover Gang does it again!!! Might be my new favorite. Gonna go for a drive and turn this one way up.
AAAAAHHHHHHHH I'M SO EXCITED
WHY so quiet? Walking softly...carrying a big stick.
Found you through Tim dude, keep up the fight!
Once again Tom, a true masterpiece. Thanks for not being no sell out.
Talk yo ish bruh
Love you brother 💪🏻. As always! Keep grinding. They can't stop your rise to legendary status. No matter how much they try. Music was made to send messages to the average people against the elite. Mainstream music lost sight of that. This is why they oppress you. Your getting love on TimCast, as well as other major cultural circles. We support you 1000%. Gi harder than ever! This fight needs you!!!!
HOG forever! Stay independent and underground! Fuck the industry
Dude… I love the visuals in this! Props to Nova! Y’all are KILLIN it!
Nice job with the video, Nova
AMAZING!!!!  Hella digging the metal feeling to this sound.
❤ the song and video 🔥 as always!!!!!

Damn Nova that was awesome,  You were pretty good too Tom 🤪 Awesome job again! 👏 H.O.G.

Speaking of always gotta name drop... the game reference or am I watching too many game diss tracks?
Yo Tom I don't know if you must have heard what went down for me Labor Day weekend but this is the nail on the head bro you always do love yo jamz!!
Tom killed the beat & Nova killed the video👌
This is epic. That’s all
Omg bro 😭 different and beautiful!
You've done it again.
Been waiting for the new song! Thanks dude
Another banger from my man Tom he literally can’t miss 🔥 🔥 🔥
Tim Pool sent me...
Love it
TOM IS BADASS...BRYSON GRAY IS A TRUTHER TOO💯🇺🇲💥🙏 love cricket chirps btw🦗
Thank you for another message and great video. 👍👍😊
Around a year ago I had an MRI scan, the technician asked me what station I wanted to listen to. I responded “Tom MacDonald”. She started the station as I was in the MRI machine. Almost everyone gets a couple of checkup calls during the scan. Lol I didn’t get a single communication from the technician. I didn’t care about this but I knew something was going to happened after I was done. As soon as the scan completed and I got out of the machine. The technician insinuated that I was a racist due to the music being “some racist stuff.” I responded “Are you insinuating that I am a racist?!” and got the slightly withdrawn response “No but that music definitely is.” I responded “What part of it was racist?” the technician couldn’t come up with an example.              Mr. MacDonald, your music is amazing, inspiring, original, and uniting. I have been a long time fan. Keep up the fantastic work and please always remember how many people across the globe love and look up to you. Godspeed.
Damn straight fire.
❤️🤘😜🤘❤️
Tom McDonald  I'm definitely a fan  .I love your songs  keep up with the good work
The crickets chirping as part of the beat is a nice touch! Love the mountain of skulls and the tornado in the apocalyptic wasteland. Awesome video editing!
Another one 🔥🔥🔥
One of your best by far!!! 🎯💜💯
You got Ripped! Based Tom MacDonald! Keep it up
Dude! Whoever mastered this this rocked it!
Only heard it over my phone speakers can’t wait to hear it on some subwoofers. And honestly the best song you made yet. Keep it up man. And don’t let know one put you down.
Wish i had called in today sho i could've seem this when it hit the tube. The whole song is a lyrical explosion.
I'm a huge fan of yours .. but this is pure garbage ... The visuals were amazing.. but the song was rap trash .. c'mon man ... This was so bad I turned it off .. first song ever of yours I was totally disappointed by .. not only me but everyone in the room we all gathered looked at ourselves and said wtf is this absolute garbage .. so disappointed.. your going backwards .. your pushing out too much to fast maybe but this was your worst song period !!!
🤟💯🔥🔥
Love the guitar!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

I never comment on anything.....  This????!!????  Fuck!!!!!!  Banger!!!!!
I've only just found you a few weeks ago and SO glad I did. You're the bomb! Speaking nothing but truth. Unlike most sell-out rappers out there. Thank you for being you and staying true to yourself.
Based on the lyrics I imagine this is Trump talking to Biden
Imagine a Tom MacDonald and Hopsin colab

Ok normally I don't comment on your videos even though I love them but I have to say I am amazed at this video. I don't even want to know how many hours it took to film, edit, cut and finalize the video. The work that went into this is amazing and like always the song is amazing.
Great job...one of my favorite ones an thats sayin something
Best one yet 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥⭐️👊😎😎
Tom's a non stop hit machine tearing it down once again!
TRUMP2024MencantbewomenleftistsareidiotsChristisKingIwillneverfold. Ho
As always, Dropping top quality shit! ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Like your songs but who are you referring to in this song? Just wondering.
Another hit man you're on fire Tom
I think you need to talk to jack richland
This shit 🔥🔥🔥, tom!!!!!!!! Keep bringing the bangers and burn all the haters down!!!!!!!
Keep up the good work young man!
Fire
Mad respect for this legend
This the real counter culture right here
Dope bro, fucken dope!
I gotta be honest here. I think the video production is even better than the song. And its a great song. Nova has outdone herself again. Shes one super talented woman. Hats off to her.
Here goes another #1 that be shadow band
Real peoples champion!
Bro, just no words, how is every song so good!?
This is good, however I do prefer the political music more.
Once again, you are absolute FIRE!!!! You are as well Nova!!!!
Till I'm a 👻or 👨‍🦽
Another banger from the GOAT!!
Tell it Tom.
Thanks Tom for speaking the truth, so many out there won't. Thanks again and keep it
wow this is phat!  why they so quiet?  they got nothin.  i love everything about this track but that guitar tho man it sounded good
Another comment for more support
Tom’s music speaks to so many people. Thank you Tom. We love you and it’s us against the world!!
Well done dude!!
RESPECT
Once again truth telling at the the top of your lungs. Another home run by the dynamic duo. You kids make a great team . An original power couple ,, your creating magic. And people love you more than the Twitter or AI bots. I'd love to attend
🤘
Nice visual graphics. Nova really upped her game here. She’s a beast in her own right. Of course that goes without saying for you Tom. Hell yeah to this one.
Great lyrics as usual. And the damn video is just amazing. His video crew are top notch. Always visually entertaining
Guess you been practicing guitar more lately. Sounds good bro, love the vfx too. This beast is getting bigger all the time and Tom's investing in himself.
Is there a plan to do some gigs in the near future? If so i hope you will come to the uk 🙏🏻
Commenting for support
Nice one
Damn.
Cant say I like this one Tom, too much chest thumping. Humble yourself... I say this as a huge fan who cares  very much.  Pride comes before the fall, I dont want to ever see you fall Tom. ❤❤❤
Nova and Jared…..damn geniuses (and Tom, of course).
Another great hit Tom. A Real one and he doesn't hold back.
Hell yes 🙌 👏 🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲
I love you Tom MacDonald this song is so good 🖤🫶🏻
Yet again another awesome video! Love the skulls!
bro this has to be one of my top fav! This slaps so hard!
Every time I listen to your songs, my reaction is like "no wonder why the cookie-cutting big music & entertainment corps hate you so much"
more FIRE from Tom!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Adding Jared was/is a nice touch. Another level when you add a master Graphix Artist like that. But the voice, beat. hook, the team, all the same level of awesome, kick ass work everyone!
I like it but it seems like  Toms music is just about going after other rappers now days. A lot of songs are just talking about how big he is.   I love your message man but ..    Come on dude get back to Names or No Lives Matter jams again. I want content not talking about bashing others even though they are shit. we already know that.
Peace of mind is the ultimate form of wealth separation is faith in fear over love 🤩🙏
Fake ppl and liars always quiet...not me lol, but respectful yes. They shhh listen and observe BC they can't multitask hahahaha
BooM!!  The Gatekeepers are growing weaker. They can't handle that the culture's shifting. Keep on keeping on Tom!
This shit is AMAZING!!!!!
Fire, Tom!
Nothing but fire 🔥
This is pretty great. What a vision in the video production. Stands out.
Another mother fucking banger keep it up dude! Thank you for creating the soundtrack to my life and the anthems that I bump.
I love the new video but I wish it was longer. Really love the wordplay. Keep it up Tom!! Dont keep us in suspense. XD
Wow!!! Another amazing song!!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🤙🤙🔥
Trump should use this song !Another great rap!
Once again, EXCELLENT!
Fire homie , love the video.tom & Nova rock 🤘🤘
Let's go been ready 🔥 🔥 🔥
🔥 🔥 🔥
awful lot of dandruff in the comments
The beat doesn’t mesh with the words
Favorite track/beat yet
Them damn crickets....🔥🔥💪👋👋
Yea! Tell em how your feet don't fit in clown shoes!  (Ps Jesus loves you all! )
Dude... The song is fakking awesome... But this video, man. Daym 😲
Miss you broski
Love it Tom. Keep'em coming.
Muahahahaha fkn brilliant
Great song bud love the distortion.  YOU NEVER DISAPPOINT BRO...
Thank goodness this guy was wearing contacts; I thought he got his eyes tattooed like an idiot after seeing the previous music vid.
Straight fire!!
10/10 my man 💪 it really dosent get better.
i was expecting political stuff but yeah this pretty heat
Keep it up, Tom. We got you. Great job!
Fire bud ❤️
Love this!!
Another absolute Knockout. How does Tom continue to drop these killer tracks and amazing videos when top artists with massive studios behind them drop 1-2 songs a year and maybe 1 good video?   HOG is owning the industry.
♥️🤍💙💋😊LOVE YOU! LOVE NOVA.
2 minutes and 38 seconds of fuck yeah!!
Love it👍
💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
Tom is nuclear 🔥
That was really good.  The VFX was a nice surprise and looks really well done.
Normally not a fan of this type of music. But you tom are a favorite. God bless you and I hope you ultimate success.
I enjoyed this more than I thought I would
This song feels truly epic. I mean this in a positive way. I was bummed when it ended
Hey Tom I’m a huge fan! I actually wrote and made a music video in honor of what you and nova are doing producing such fire!! I would love to hear what you think?! Thanks man!!   https://youtu.be/BSS85LrZdNw
send me my sweatsuit bro 👍
That's one hell of a video, love ur shit homie
This shit slaps
Been subbed since 200k followers. Shit makes me proud to be one of the OG fans.
i love your music
f**king fire bro
Real shit about real issues about real people. Even at 60 his drift speaks to brain waves
Go Tom. Shared on my FB
You should come to Rocklahoma 2023!! It would be amazing to see you on there!!
The irony of this being censored
🔥
I keep listening to this and each time I love it a little more. Man you speak the honest truth, That everyone is afraid to admit! Thank you for making me not feel so lost in this big world. Your an inspiration!
A SKULL-NADO of Bars
Big ups, bro! Fuck the industry, fr. Artists like you are the only ones I support with my money.
TOTAL FIRE , NOVA STRAIGHT SAVAGED THE VIDEO !!!!!
Wow.  I don't even like rap, this just rocks!
Another banger! Hells yeah!
🤘
🔥🔥🔥
This is 🔥! Don't stop your killing it!
That was good…it took me a little longer to get into the song then the other ones I think it took me 5 seconds to get into this one…another great hit Tom…but then again that’s what you’ve always popped out is great hits….
Banger, love ❤️ it!!!! Amazingly awesome graphics, well done tom and nova and to anyone from hog !!’
Well did, sir. Well did.
Tom macdonald is the real deal!!! You have so much talent.
KittySoup 😊
Love that rock edge ! Wish it was longer 🤷‍♂️
Tom awesome song… more surprising is  Over 5 thousand comments and I have yet to see a negative one
I'm just so sick of the same trap beats... But cool on Tom for pushing against the narrative and showing you can still succeed.
Bro when you are going to do some shows in the US?
while a great song, why censorship? that is, say it, bullshit! still a great song but fuck censorship.
Still give a like but I'm just not feeling this channel now.  I don't relate with being you lol. Unless its broke depressed mental breakdowns and every kind of stress. No checks I would bonestly eat a handful of semtex walk into flames then mayb I can blow up the board, like wizards chess looking around like who's blessed cheating mofos you next.
THE MAN, THE MYTH, THE LEGEND!  Dropping smash hits everytime! Was too busy in my kitchen to play it today.... But look out tomorrow! LOL THE OLD GOLFERS ARE GOING TO DIE HEARING THIS OUT MY KITCHEN TOMORROW!!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
👍🏽👍🏽
Good job
Tom is like a box of chocolates, ya never know what you're gonna get. Lol. But you can always bet it'll be F'NG 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 So glad I discovered Tom many years ago and have had truly enjoyed watching his rise and growth. He's such an amazing person. And I'll never get tired of his music. So much more to say, but don't want to write a novel. I turned my mom onto Tom a few years back and she absolutely loved his music as well. She recently passed on August 11th after a 3 year battle with Stage 4 Ovarian Cancer that spread to her brain. I found an old email she sent you a couple of years ago. Where she was telling you how much I loved your music along with my 2 sons and how she loved you too. Keep bringing the 🔥 Tom. ❤️
Bro, you know Spence dissed you on the Pull the Plug (the game diss) right?
How you gonna rip the blessed line so hard
I get on the bus and hear this and 10/10
No disappointments here!!! This is just next level! Go Tom Go

Wow This video is so sick in good way, Great job by all involved !!!!! each one that come out is better than the last one, I do not know how you all do it !!!
Tom this s*** goes so hard bro, that s*** sounds like one of those old pastor troy beats, got that Rock sound in the background, and the way that your flow dances All around The melodies... Tom you only getting better bro
Thanks for the punch in the gut looks like you got another stare down here and you won again. Congratulations on another winner.
Keep doing you Tom. Every song is a heavy hitter.☠️💣💥🤘
I've been waiting so long for this to come out
I fucking love the video man! Good job n it’s all u love it😎👍
You da best Tom MacDonald 💪💪💯💯💯
5 seconds in and I hit like already!
Everyone buy on iTunes let's get Tom to #1 let's make the stations play his music, shift the culture back.
I hope you find out someday how many people considered elderly are listening to you. Truth is where we find it, keep speaking it.
Tom is the goat!!!
🔥 as always tom.
this is the worst song of tom MacDonalds ive heard and even this is bumpin. keep up the good work Tom.
Just made my day. Thanks for yet another amazing song and video
So much respect for you . Your energy is a gift. Your fearless.  You and Nova keep up the fantastic  work your doing. Really enjoyed it.
Well I don't know about y'all but I like it. I thought the spike coat was bad azz to.
Damnnn that was good 🔥
Love it!!!❤️👏👏
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
bruh this beat is fucking fire. I LOVE the trap metal sound
So sick!!! Love you Tom, keep smashing!!!
Hell yeah! Loving the metal vibes 🤘🏻
love this song. but im wonderin who you're dissin. i know you are dissing the industry as a whole. but some of the lyrics seem pretty directed.
Why so quiet my opinion only here and that is because people do not want to step up and do what is right because they know if they do they’re going to lose what little they do have so they sit back and do nothing and let it happen that’s why it’s crickets. And that’s why people such as myself have moved to places that are strong holds of conservatives and not liberals which is the state of Texas don’t mess with Texas.
On my Tattoo I get in 2023  Eminem Tom Macdonald Tupac Nas  My fave 4
So great
yes!!! This was worth the quiet from you and nova! You two are a whole damn production team and more.  Amazing video. Another banging tune also! #HANGOVERGANG
❤❤❤❤❤ Awesome video again! You and Nova are STARS! I love it!

So talented, so versatile, so daring, sounds amazing, looks amazing, just outright FN cool 😎!!  Blew me away!!!  This is how music is supposed to sound,  this is how videos are supposed to look!  Wow Nova and Tom!  HOG!!!👍 take notes mainstream rappers this is how you do it
When you gonna put a new song out Tom?
👍✌️😉😊
Spitting venom!!  "I am on the independent Mount Rushmore, you're an f***ing nobody...a legit clown!!"
@Tom MacDonald gotta say man loving the metal punk style rap man it works keep being you brother you build your empire and we will all be there
As a teen I listened to a song called R.I.O.T. (Righteous Invasion Of Truth) By Carmen Licciardello. He was a Christian artist who recently passed. You should give it a listen. It has a surprisingly similar vibe to many of your songs. Loved this one. My neighbors will be hearing this coming and going.
Mint
Incredible artist and testifier of the corrupted times in which we live.
I am 65. First rap I ever liked.
This video is incredibly well made, wow!
The tracks 100 and the video's 110!!
#HOG
Nova really out did herself this time. That was a dope ass video. Was a good ass song too.
This on a whole nother level Tom!
🤘🏼❤️‍🔥🤘🏼
Tom’s running the independent game while so big he’s on mainstream radar!!!
Well Nova, you've excelled yourself with this video. Great job. and well done. ice one Tom. Still hoping someone somewhere sees your work and wakes up to the real world. Keep it up fella. TTFN
Haven't started listening might edit if have things to add but very likely going to be lit anyway!       Also If their is things anyone wants to say you can always reply
Love IT! Dayum!
Your a bad ass true patriot Tom. This song, like all your others gets people woke. God bless you and your crew PEACE🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲 for real, true banger🤘🤘

Its about time you stop singing (and caring) about you being the best. WE ALL KNOW THAT and we all admire you. Now you can please let us know about the amazing/awesome/interesting/loving stuff you have in your life. Cuz theres no freakin way your story is all about just that. This is clip and music and rap is insane tho

Sick!!! Can we bow to Nova's talent 🙌🙌🙌 all around such a power couple!!!
SHARING to support the artist
HOLY HECK I LLVE THIS SO MUCH TOM
That was totally SICK!!
💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
Just what the music industry needs right now, an apocalypse....and Tom's going to bring it to them. If they were smart they would just walk away, but they won't and it's going to be epic! Just like what's going on with big government right now, they all going to find out that it's the people who run this
You really need to go on tour I would love to see you live on stage and pretty sure you would sale out a stadium for sure you are way better than Eminem keep making Hits and I will keep downloading them
When tour?
I said it once I'll say it again. Tom gonna start WW3 with all this Nuclear Fire he dropping!
Another great song. 👍
Everybody buy this song, we need to make it to where the media is forced to talk about tom!
HOG4LIFE.... bro this is straight fire been waiting for.... let them know exactly how it is man 😂
Hell yeah @Tom MacDonald! Another one to rip some more pieces away from the crooked industry! You keep proving time and again that the industry sellouts are very wrong about you AND you get to hold on to your dignity as well as produce something that you can be proud of.     YOU my friend are a part of what the American dream is all about.
🤘FUCKING BANGER!
They’re just insects Spineless Rejects Waiting on covid injects I’ll fly high with no eject because I mean no disrespect my object is to protect so please neglect the fact I may be correct and unchecked you may be under the effect of infect. 😂😂😂   I’m sorry Tom I’m just a kid that doesn’t rap doesn’t sing doesn’t play any instruments and I just try you make me one of Try Rhyming and rappin 😂😂😂 I’m sorry guys I’ll stop
You and Nova really out did yourselves on this one. Awesome video. Keep them coming. Lots of love to you both.
Awesome track.  Technically amazing.  But, it didn't hit me in the feels.  It's missing the live action sets, societal discourse, and deep introspection.  This felt like another "Still independent look at me look at me I'm awesome check out my green screen."  Imma go revisit No Lives Matter, People So Stupid, & my all time fave Sober.  -- my penny's worth of 2 cents
someone please pair the chorus with comparing MAGA to biden crowd sizes
Like the rock rap contacts.. Reminds me of lil wayne on his rebirth album.
Hell fuckin yeah!!!!
Another big banger
I love this broooooo.  That guitar hits hard when it hits. Much love. The Maine skin checking in baybayyyyyy.
Hells YES! Keep spitting bro. You the MAN.
DAMN!!! The song Ended WAY TOO SOON!! I WANT MORE!!! 👍🏽👍🏾👍🏿🇺🇲🇮🇱🇺🇲🇮🇱🇺🇲🤘🏿🤘🏾🤘🏽
This is dopest of dope bro. Thank you. For just being you. Great job  I’d like to add, that my sister brought you to my attention because the way I think and believe is all in your music. I’m still like, wow.
Blown away! #HOGforever
I'm 49 years old ,I'm not shitting on this track .I honestly want to know why you think this track is amazing
I gotta be honest...I was so mesmerized by the videography that I didn't listen to the words the first time.  Nova, FABULOUS job!! Listened to it again and of course, Tom didn't disappoint at all!!  You both are amazing!!
Wow! Just, wow!!
Fox censorship why are you begging to demand for money on your likes and comments? I understand it's a living situation and surviving, but why in the fuck is this song censored?
Listened.  Purchased.
Very well done!
Even Tom can drop a fail from time to time.  Still a fan, but don't like this song.
This fuckin quality production 🔥
This some badass shit man. When the new album gonna drop? I can't wait to get my hands on one
Another dope song man, keep it up!
best song you ever made keep it up
I miss 00's hip hop
<3 Both you and Nova are on another level! The top! This is fire! " Let's start a riot!"
Not a huge fan of rap but came to give the bro a like and sub. Appreciate what he is doing.
DAMN!!!! This just hits differently! Great energy!!💥💯Been a die-hard fan since the first time I heard you and I've never really been a fan of anyone like that before. I don't follow other artists or anything, even though I really love all types of music.  I also never understand people saying they were thrown off by your appearance...🤷‍♀ I actually love the way you look!! But then again I was born and raised in Amsterdam, the capitol of FREE THINKERS... Love you Tom, and you Nova!!!!❤
Not digging this one not gonna lie.
Tom MacDonald killing it with another banger. Keep it up
I kind of feel Tom you are the best and the baddest 100 but.... less humility moves you further from your fans and humanity. We are in a culture war and spiritual battle.. not time to boast time help our younger gen see the way
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I thought it before but after hearing that guitar i really want a metal colab. I know you got that Korn shirt reach out they might down worth a shot. Just stay independent.
This hit so fucking hard my boy 🫡🇺🇸
This is the bonus to my paycheck today HOG
💚💚💚

I came to listen because Tim Pool recommended glad I did, great song and video
why was the vid up so early with comments deactivated and not showing on his channel for a while? dope shit tho
i liked the vid, but this isnt really my thing. in god we trust, dummies, the system, the best rapper ever, snowflakes etc and the album The Brave.  Edit: names
I wish more people were as brave as you. I’ve never really been into rap, but love Mr. MacDonald. Thank you 🤘
Subscribed with all notifications on and didn't see anything for the announcements for this song or anything else. More YouTube games.
Thank you Tom seeing what you’ve done has inspired me to follow my dreams and not give a f@$k what anyone cares
The Man! 😎
Hell yeaaaaaaah!!! This is my favorite so far!!!
Wow, nova what an absolute goddess you are. You can really see the progression of your skills in Eve video. Your such a legend man,   Love love love Nova 🖤🖤
That beat is nasty good
Even if I never made another dollar again, I'm blessed 🙌🙏
🔥🔥🔥
Musical genius!!
Trash
Omg Fuqing AMAZING
K...I love fri...ur the man I so much love ur shit...thx 4 more great stuff \m/
"put you 6 feet in the dirt, that's an underground rapper" ayyyyyyyye!!!!
#HOGLOVE4LIFE
Thanks to TIM POOL for shouting out this song ................TOM MacDONald and NOVA should be on TIMCAST IRL show 4sure ........that would be a great show
I see and hear crickets but none are good at the game. Let’s show them we Ain’t the same! 11 players unlike any coming down on you like rain ☔️    😂 I’m so bad at rap but Tom makes me wanna try at least 😂😂😂
Great work Tom & Nova song is 🔥 just like so many another song's you guys have done.  You guys are loved from all over the world. I've been listening to you for awhile my son's showed me your songs and since then I've been listening. Both you and Nova rock, Much love from Australia 🙏❤️🇭🇲
YEAH TOM 🤑🤟💯
🥰🥰🥰
Chills like usual. Keep killing it bro.
Tim Pool sent me here. DOPE music! Copped the single too!
the metal vibe that Tom does is the greatest
AWESOME!
Tom is GOATEd
Rocked it again, dog! Epic as always!
Feeding the algo!!
That was amazing bruh!🔥🔥🔥
Being a independent musician is impressive, but the "Video by Nova" part is probably the most impressive part of this music video. It's very well made.
Well done good and faithful servant!!
It's was great shouldnt have ended so quick should at least have a mad guitar solo on the way out
Awesome video 😊👍🏻💖
gotta be my fave track yet. absolutely killed it. insane video
Tom. I doubt you'll read this. But please don't rap about yourself. I love Eminem's first album. And then he started rapping about himself and I was turned off. Maybe I'm the only one that feels that way. Just my opinion Just just my two cents
Artisan music. Stratospheric. Being pushed by Timcast doesn't hurt.
Drill, Rock, Trap just missing some country vibes. 🔥
I hate most rap and have never considered any of it my favorite...that being said you not only are now one of my favorite artists of all time, I actually am only excited to hear when you're about to drop a new song. Thanks for being a voice for many of us and yet another great song! Keep doing the good work you do man
Just what I needed today, thanks for the hype Tom! Youre the GOAT
Yes, thank you for TRUTHING the world. God bless you and protect you in your walk. ❤️🙏🇺🇲
Timcast told me to watch
Oh fuk yeah
Great compilation as always with your music. So glad you stay true , thank you !
Awesome 👏🏻
keep this shit coming!! we need rappers like you, Acal, Struggle, mesus, church...etc...etc...
💪🔥
Serious shit bro and all of it aside. I havent been able to decide a favorite video for a while. This is a fucking banger. Thank you Tom and Nova for all your hard work. We love yall.
YES👏🏻🔥
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 another one for the books! ❤️
So much heat. So much meaning. You're an inspiration to so many.
Thank you Tom! Great message! 👍🏻🎶🎼
This video tho! That beat is the ish!
STRAIGHT 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Like your new song 🎵 👌  keep your music going!! Wana hear more 🤯👍🫂🎶🎶🎤🎧📻
Just...dope
Nove fucking killing it
Video is great, Song is 🤷‍♂️
Not my favorite.
I'm independent sit down Brovo well said 🇺🇲 💪 👏
More fire.  Keep speaking from the heart and just let the haters hate.
That was a pretty cool video. 😎
Good job Tommy keep ‘em coming
i like how i have the notification bell on then this video drops and i got no notifications youtube is wilyn
I've been a fan for over 2 yrs now, I almost spit beer through my nose last week, a friend came over very excited about this "new guy" he found on youtube... He was stoked as hell lol. Your music and message is real and I feel it on a personal level. Thank you and Nova for being real as fuck i a fake as fuck world. Peace!
💥💥💥 BANGER! Will be jammin in this in my car for the next month or so!
Flame Flame Flame all Flames forever

NOVA KILLING IT TOO!!! VIDEO IS AMAZING!🔥🔥 DOPE SONG TOM!!!
Oh yeah this one fire fasho! 👍🏽👍🏽
I’ve listened a few times on Apple already, just wanted to drop by and give the video a like!
eminem wishes he was as cool as this. i paid. everyone buy this song. send the message.
We stand up,,, thank you Tom.
All you had to say was "THE CABAL IS REAL BUT THEY AINT DRINKING BABIES BLOOD" for me to know you're controlled Ops..you ain't fooling us...👹👹👹 Adrenochrome junky himself probably 🤮
Honestly Tom I’m getting bored 😐, and it’s like if it’s not raw , we need more of youre raw stuff like back in the days with your speeches with no music and youre flow was doing all of it , honestly it’s the best Tom Macdonald I can have in my opinion, you’re music is excellent but The theme is getting repetitive and boring.. But i freaking love you Tom and that does not mean I’m hating for other people thinking this is a hater getting off on Tom no he is the best but lately idk it’s missing something for me. Maybe I overlistened to the songs too 😂
Hey it's Arnold brink jr.. Heyy tom! Been a fan since day one
Sweet.
CONTROLLED OPPOSITION POS
Hey please hear me out, I'm a massive rock fan, I'm not big on rap but my playlist is literally 80% tom macdonald, when I heard that beat it made me think,  has Tom ever done a rock collaboration? Like a Jay z linkin park one, it's just my own little fantasy but fml that would be amazing, maybe with skillet or breaking Benjamin,  sorry for the essay, loved the new song and as always I've left a like ❤️ keep doing you Tom your the best man
Must've paid some dollar for this video
Wow! Wow! Wow! This was fire!!!!!!
Just 💣💥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🌬💋

Tim Pool bought me here ,awesome Tom and Nova !
Love it!
Well damn, this Jared guy knows some things.  Mysterious things which only the AV gnomes who operate Adobe Inc fully comprehend.   Fucking "underground rapper" lmao
We need a Tom & Nova tour! Will legit fly anywhere to see you in concert #HOG 🤘❤

Omg Tom that was awesome!!!!!
🔥🔥🔥

Think you should try to market your music in the UK still not many people heard of your name in England
The pile of bones reminds me of the lefties in their cry closets!!!!
Good stuff

Quarter million views in 5 hours with no features and no label... The Zeus of Independent artists!
Tom macdonald 2024 you got my vote dog
Let’s gooooooo
Amen 4 real!!! We stand united!!!! Right here ready!!!!!!!!
Daaammmnnnnn Tom!! Video is sick!! You have out done yourself again brother
So sick! Thank you bro!
I don't care what anyone says this dude is a sellout. If you show up to the industry he speaks on. He speaks on things that there's known to the public. He doesn't expose anything. It's videos are always very dark and demonic. He is one of those. I see you
Tim Poole sent me and glad he did since this rocks. Bought it already on Amazon.
The lyrics to this song hit heavy. #HOG
Dude!! Homie!! Dog!! Bro!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟 LOVE YOU❤❤❤
🔥🔥🔥
i loved IT!!!
Loved it! Amazing visuals!!! Great job!
A Bennie wearing fence sitter sent me here. Xp
Great video!! Riot? Sounds like Portland OR
Novas gotta know there's tons of ladies out here with a crush on Tom😍. That jacket is dope!
I wish I could get on one of his tracks. you made me love rap again
Excellent as always!
i was just hating on mcbroom and almost hated on you but yo this is fire
Eh...decent
Sick video, great track, hard lyrics. Hypnotizing stare! Another 10/10
The fire department showed up to my house when I played this.
loving the metal vibe!!
A little to rapid for me to understand, so I'll have to watch and listen to it again, but I liked what I could understand.
Blown away and surprised with you again and again making the song you last dropped my favorite. You are a legend already. This song sets into stone you are amongst the most unique, important, creative and legendary artists of the 21st century.
Dope 😎 👍🏼
Coming here from Tim Pool.  Honestly, this song is dope.  The beat and chorus are fire 🔥
Fucing 🔥 bro keep doing you.  H.O.G forever
🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘 Love the guitars!!! I feel more of the edge in it! More!!!!!
If you just search "riot", this comes first. Before any news, riot games, or any other Riot related anything.
good song & I'm a fan HOG. However it's not a favorite so far it seemed like a short song & i wasn't very moved. Clowns, fake woke &Snow flakes ❄️  those were bangers. This idk 🤷‍♂️ maybe i need to listen to it a few more times
legendary freestyle 2->https://youtu.be/TuicMslyNs8
and song ofc but that mv…
You have better song But this is okay
fucking badass music video tom
Feels like it's been forever since I've heard anything new from ToM lately ... Hope all is well H.O.G 🤘🏻💋🖤
This song hits different when you walk in the dark rocking your best neon outfit on🦅🔥
Another banger
HELK YEAH BROTHER ☝️💯🤟💪 what an awesome freakin track lovr it H.O.G family forever
Awesome song.  Nova is production work is amazing
Tom is Putting serious work in keep climbing brother they know you slipped threw the crack sooner or later they'll get tired of trying to silence and cancel you too much work we all know their all lazy af!!!!
It's good to see an artist that's not a corporate sell out 👍👍 don't let them control you..
Friggin sick!!! 🔥 🔥 🔥
Tim Pool just shouted out this song and told everyone to go buy it on his show .. independent boi!!! Get it
Nice visuals but not really the best I've seen from you Tom.
DUDE!!!! The beat, the visuals, the lyrics, the videography it is all FIRE! You and Nova were meant to make videos and music together, that's all I know at this point!
I've been following you and your music since 2018 and every time you drop it's a masterpiece. Definitely going down as one of the greats! Mush love Tom 🍄
The guitar sound is cool
Love it❣❣❣❣
Decent 👌 the hook is class, Tom swings and never misses
What’s up with your fascination with dressing up like the devil?
Wouldn’t say the best but good as always. Keep killin it man 🤘🏻🇺🇸🤘🏻
Tha k you for being a singer with honor. You message is so respectable and I hate rap and have always been disgusted by it. Until a coworker had me listen to your stuff. You have gained my respect sir. Also i bought some of your music.
🔥🔥🔥
🌟🌟❤️Tim Pool gave you a shoutout today
legend
This song needs a "play on repeat" button.
It takes real talent, passion and integrity to spit bars like this.
Hey Tom, it's great to see ya again. I love the heavy riffs in this song, reminds me of "Ashes to Ashes", (my favorite 😁). Keep it up man, we are so lucky to have you on this planet inspiring a new generation. Thank you.
OK this one got to me on the 2nd listen, well done sir!
🦗🦗🦗
He says “Im blessed” with an upside down cross on his face. Who are you blissed by Tom. The Lord will not be mocked. Good luck with that.
H.O.G
Weak AF 🤣 how u Gunna start a riot when your whole fanbase is a flock of 🐑 y don't you actually try to b different man https://youtu.be/eCBBTkThJ74
OMFG that was frickin awesome!
I love the rock edge to this!  I think it's great.  I think you should take that rock edge that you have a step further and see what happens.  I think you would find a magical place of awesomeness and unicorns.  It would be fire.
Yo its like a late bday present to me man, shit might as well be Christmas and my b day any Friday tom wants to drop. Keep it up man. H O G
Hell yea nice job brother 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯
New subscriber after hearing about you on Tim Pool's channel. Great music!
not my style however im glad you are calling attention to the sus actions of the industry
Love it!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
cool song
Couldn't watch when it dropped cuz of work, but im watchin now and im lovin every second of it over and over and over again! Killin it as always by being the one to speak out and call a pile a pile!
Just received the text from Tom to check this new song I'm feeling it glad to share @tommacdonald
Sick rips!! Never disappoint. So so very talented. Speaking truths. No disrespect, no disgracing woman, rising up, staying strong and spreading connection. Keep it coming! ;) thank you
OMG....Bro,  You and Nova killed this... TNlll%
Is Tom a T800?
Absolutely LOVE IT! COOL JACKET, cool mix with metal👍🤘
Keep it up little brother, I got your six, Nova too.
Another Awesome song by Tom...🔥🔥
Whooooa! Nice job!
Fire as always, absolutely love it
A man who stick to his roots and stays true to his conviction and what he believes mad respect brother keep spitting the truth
Liked, and left a comment to help you with the YouTube Algorithm.  God bless...
Definitely not feeling this one sorry just my opinion. I’m a hip hop fan at my very core but I’ve been a major fan of metal, punk rock, & oi for nearly 20 years along with hip hop. I’m 40. For a lot of people it will hit but for those of us that grew up on metal riffs & mosh pits…trying to blend rap into it has always been a very fine line. Too many bands in the past have made metal/rock rap sound too cheesy straight the fuck up. And once an element of pop sound is added into a track it really loses me. Love your work Tom I respect yours & Nova’s hustle & creativity but it just kind of hits wrong with me. So what. I hope people like it & it gets the numbers you’re hoping for. I think without the softer pop element in the track would’ve been better but God bless you both keep creating the art that you create so well💪🏻
Okay Tom McDonald let's get that rock album out
Love ya Tom!  Thanks for another wonderful beat.  Your songs are great workout motivation.  Keep killin it dude.
Damn that was good.
The song is dope af but that music video...Dayyum man..The skeletons swirling around n shit...Shit is sick.
Great visual…great track…@TomMacDonald being Tom…beast!
TM nailing it as usual 🎧🖤 https://youtu.be/qwmdYH-f2Js
Amazing.
wow this is so good!!!!!!!!
F.I.R.E. Period ! Thanks for that man.
🙌🙌 💯💯💯
To repetitive
I am just seconds in...... The chugging, Hell ya!!!
CGI is better than She-Hulk's lmao
Dont like mainstream. Drop the Jesus badge kill that illusion expose the truth about the guilt trip fairytale. No one died or got sacrificed for any sins. Its just a marked scam to put you down.
Proof tom doesn't need political rap to make good music.
Just discovered Tom MacDonald, off the hook. I can’t believe the flow and profound meaning, a voice that should, needs to be heard!!! Awesome!
"No one knows your name that's why you have to name drop"
Everytime a new song or video drops its always a good day!  🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
#HOG !!! Thank yall !!! Bad Ass !!!!! SHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!
This one grows on ya.  Legend.
bro love it but something big is comming ur way tim pool has been talking about u brother, but both u guys fighting the war but in different ways
Tom dropping another dope ass video. We know it would have been alot easier to sell out to a big label, so thank you for doing the grind and staying real.
❤️
Always look forward to your music! My son turned this 50 year old on to your music- thank god! Just love it! You feel the way we feel! HOG forever!! Never stop! You and Nova got this!
Love this it's 🔥fire one of my favourites your the best
Damn!!! 🔥
🔥 💯
I love your music, and that I never know what's coming.
Scars and church are my favorite by u
Was  thinking this might be an outcry against the riots from 2019-2020 that destroyed entire cities, and lawlessness in certain stupid segments of the population, but no. It's about how your concerts are riots.  Missed opportunity.
Love Nova she has skills, but the FX on this vid is great!!!
From “People So Stupid” to here, love your art man💪🏽🗿
Tom, your music, Tim Pool's music, that shit is Anthem worthy. I know what you are doing, and i freakin love it. Your music can truly change the world. Im sending you money, and then im going to buy your merch. After that i may even buy your song, that i listened to for free. We support you.
I used to hate when every song had a rap breakdown but I'd love a tim Poole song with a Tom breakdown every day of the week
you should come back to Canada and run the show.. kick out the libs and show folks how it's done lol
I love it! 🔥
Those GFX are popping. You're the Master Gang now.
Thank you SIR TOM for giving all other artists ideas on being “THEIR OWN ENTITY” and not some 2 bit record labels biatch.  As they are just looking to enslave young new artists as they take everything, including their soul, away from them!  GOD BLESS…pounding new art piece Sir Tom.  Thank you!
Another one that hits hard love it Tom banged it out the park man you just are to badass for this world to handle much love Tom and nova hog till the end  stay strong and much love for the hog family straight up
You and upchurch just said something about Mai stream his yesterday for winda tint and you with riot... fucking awesome...
sick
Metal??? Love it ! ! ! More please... The heavier the better...
AWESOME song Tom!!! Another in the list of Great ones! Hugs to you my favorite Rapper XOXOXO
This track is produced so good! The guitar is so nasty I love it!
Nice change up. Nailed it Tom, Nova killed it on cams, Jared slays on vfx. Home run.
Another awesome awesome spit of truth!! HOG 4 EVER!!!!
Good songs are so good ..bad  songs like this are so bad.
#H.O.G. HERE FOR IT 💪🏿💪🏿
Hey another no.1 I love this.
Tim Pool sendt me here
This video is fucking spectacular. These graphics are insane. You and Nova always do amazing shit, but this is damn impressive. No way anyone touches this. Then add in the lyrics and beat, no one can touch this. Unbelievable work Tom and Nova 👏 you have officially outdone yourselves.
Tom needs to do a song with Tech N9ne. It should be called Fuck The Industry. Tech already has a song called that from 20 years ago so it would be cool to see them both on a new version of the song.
Best choruses holy shit
hey tom, bought your single on iTunes, keep up the good work
🔥🔥🔥
Ok there you go
I love it!
Dope video! Tom wrecking harder with each video
Classic TMcD and Fresh As Fuck✓✓✓ You do not cease to AmAze!!! ✌️😎 💞🤍🔥🌏🕊️🌎🔥🤍💞
Bought it as well :)
Who came here because of Tim Pool👍 and still amazing song I love it .... Powerful 🥇
This was badass, definitely one of your best works man! I just wish it was longer.
Another hot ass song I love it
DOOOPE!!!! 🔥🔥🔥
Dope
I don't even like rap, but Tom, what a magnificent dude. He's topping and he doesn't have coprate company hanging over his head. Mad respect to this man. 👏 And damn it, I'll admit, I like his music. DAX too. They made me like rap. Their faults
I missing the message. Not the best song from Tom. Cloned rappers is way better.
soooo damn good I had to watch it twice in a row!!! Can't wait for the next banger!!!!!!!
I'm a fan, Tom's the best... definitely not my favorite video but I rock with it
Why so quiet
Tom coming through with that🔥🔥🔥
What an absolute banger!!! I’m in love!!! #hangovergang!! Loving the crickets!!!
MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE ❤️
Gave this song a listen... zero replay value, is there something im missing? narcissistic poop on repeat... Tom trying to shredd Drop D over a weak beat😅 ..
The Radio: DJ KHALIDE!!!!!! ME: Shit. Ugggg. No more. ::like 50 fat girls come out and shake butts like they blowing kisses with their butthole:: ME: Okay. Who farted?
It had to be done 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼
Big up from Czech Republic! Let's f****** goooooo!!!!
Why you bleep it out?
Your video quality gets better with every video you drop🔥
I'm glad he's part of the most hated rappers list because he is getting a lot of attention and telling the truth that people don't want to hear and more and more are hearing it every day. KEEP IT GOING TOM ✊️
Hell yea!!! HOG!!
I love it! HOG 4 life
Brother that was awesome! It was badass lyrics and the video was awesome! I loved that metal guitar chugg in there too, I can't get enough of that shit! "Why so silent" tied it all together! Keep stompin' ass brother! I love everything you do.
another great video on Friday, cause it's Tom's Day!
Tom - the woke cultist establishment hates you.   Which makes you even more likeable than you already are.  Love you!
another AWESOME Friday drop.. Nova is a keeper forever showing your best talents through hers :)  still naked is my fav visual/video
Bet Amen as the sons of light arise and the daughters of day awaken::: prime fury let these dry bones 🦴 come ALiVe ::: Shalom Amén to YeA Psalm20 be
If you guys want good lyrical rap listen to JID's the Forever Story
Best song ever
🔥
And it’s Toms words so… obviously it’s gonna be 10,000 well deserved🔥
For someone that doesn't have a professional film crew, Dauum, there are some skills there no doubt.
I love the leather jacket
Wow this is amazing..so original creative...🔥🔥
I like your other songs better. Man  I'm sorry
THANK YOU ! ! !
Y'all stepped up another level on this one!! 🔥
When is Tom Macdonald and Nova gonna make some movies
Amazing song Tom.  Love it!
Satan's Mother is found in Revelation 17-19 of The Holy Bible - The Arch Angel Revelation
Honestly catchy
Ooh love it!! NOVA— bravo- whew -amazing!!!!!!!
Instantly better than any mainstream shit by miles.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
The Anti Post....
Ok so does the mound of bones signify those in the music industry that sold their souls?
Crickets!  "it was time to feed the frog. She didn't particularly want to be an accomplice to cricket murder, but neither could she let the frog go hungry. The situation wasn't fair to the crickets or to the frog." Fed the damn Frog Tom!
I like the whole production here. It’s so good.
Welcome back love it!!
Only complaint is that the song is so short, everything else is freaking awesome. Love the guitar and intensity.
My favorite 2 rappers dropped bangers today!!! Take them to the top!!!
I love it. Can't wait till next Friday. You always start our weekends off with a jam and I love it.
Do a Song for the Framed J6ers !   www.Redpillroadshow.com

Thank you Tom love all your music. And love the fact your not afraid to speak your mind.. #H.O.G. 4 life

Great job Nova and Tom! Love it! 💗💗💗
Maybe I just need to listen again but I had a tough time figuring this one out
I dig it but damn broski why you so slow on releases we wanna hear constantly🤙🤙🤙🤙 no pressure lol
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Another straight up Banger hit em right in the Head with straight up Facts! Tom's the Man, best understand!
Another absolute banger from Tom.
Luv'ya brother. Best wishes from Central Texas!
'Kin' awesome track and the visuals! Nova could sink Tim Burton 🤘🤘
Wow
Olá Tom, gosto muito das tuas músicas e da tua ideologia, nos tempos que passamos é muito importante.
👌🏼🔥
Hmm sounds little corny…
Those crickets though
Keep on keeping on Tom! You’re the only thing right in a world so wrong 👍
This is BassAZZ!!
10 seconds in, im hooked! love this song! Thank you Tom. God Bless the King!
Anyone got the lyrics to this one? I can barely make out what he's saying.
Great work Tom and nova you guys are awesome
Nova did her thang on that one 🔥
Woooo!!!!
Definitely dig it ❤️
Killer! ❤️👏👏👏👏👏
Tom Macdonald, as a Canadian with metis children, I'd love to see you make a song about the residential schools and how it was swept under the rug forever eh! The last residential school closed in 97. Sad stain on Canadian history, brought in by the royal family.
Tim Pool sent me
Loved the guitar and other FX in the background. Sounds awesome.
Nova really did good on this set
alr this is sick, good job, that riff was worth the wait
Much love to you Tom from NorCal
Another banger Tom! And Nova, the videography is fabulous! Once again you guys have outdone yourselves!! 👏👏💯🔥
Where's the fucking lyrics. Same 3 lines over and over. Tryna hip-notize but you can't roll over. Mowing over grass you done ran over, over and over, four leafs like a clover your lucky Charms done ran out and your clout chase is over The only riot you be causing is in line at the lens crafters, perched on the rafters for about an hour you good for a riot of laughter. Your struggle aint noble when you phoning this phony shit in like a T Mobile. You so blessed then why you acting all stressed, undid the braids and forgot the dress. You ain't no Eminem or Dax, you not shatter or matter you wacker on wax you stack up these cracks rebelling against nothing a train with no tracks, ghost writers be laughing cause you minus the facts. Your flow is so-so and the lyrics are flat. Your fame is so fleeting you got so remedial, MAGA couldnt save you if Q-anon was re-tweeting you. Tom WackDonald had a farm, and on this farm he did self-harm, but don't worry his intellect is alone and unarmed, he just cuts himself and then blames his own arm. You ain't even a p*ssy you just a queef, Ive seen vegetarians handle more beef. 😴
Why are the views going down and not up??? We SEE YOU YT BS!!!!
This is amazing, the video is on a whole other level.Great Job Tom & Nova.
Yo I wanna kno who was the diss toward
Here from Tim Pool.  Subbed.
Always telling the truth. You’re a major voice in the dark. Never stop.
I want tom to get in beef on par with Mac lethal diss again
Banger for sure
Holy shit!! Nova has outdone herself!!
Yo.✌
Definitely going onto my spell playlist. I swear Tom & Ryan get the vibes on the HIGHEST. Thank you Tom for life changing music. 🤘🖤👁
Long time fan. I know a lot of your music has political meaning these days, but I’m still waiting for you to release a full or revamped version of I don’t know. Maybe you didn’t like it back in the day and that’s why it’s much harder to find but idk it’s a good song.
Thanks for another fantastic song. Keep up the amazing work!
I like the rock vibe to it.
Wow!! Congrats! and Congrats to Nova for those amazing visual effects omg
Absolutely phenomenal work as always Tom. and shout out to Nova for that amazing video. Love the vibe in this one.
That independent money well spent in this video
This is incredible! Great music as always!
Buy the song so we can get him into the number spot again
My new PR song
Hell yeah tom i been a fan for year this keeps hitting
Who else is here because of Tim Pool's recommendation?  This isn't my favorite style of music, but I enjoy helping out the new culture, even if it's just a "like" and a comment.  I'll definitely watch this again if we get a Knowlestradamus review though.
Fire 🔥 stop playing with tom keep going this fire stop playing with him he must be talking about someone one
🤘🤘🤘 Goosebumps Tom... 🔥🔥🔥 Had a sense of originality and nostalgia, the Hip Hop/Rap which we grew up on was on full display for y'all,,, Keep the Revolution alive guys✊✊✊

🔥🔥🔥🔥🎶🎵💯❤️🇺🇲
🔥  track brotha
Please collaborate with Hopsin!!
heck yes, perfect.  Love this!
I hope you know Tom your basically the voice for half this country that's been Silenced, Banned, Rediculed, Threatened and made to feel afraid or ashamed to stand in our beliefs let alone even say some extremist shit like we love America 💁‍♂️🇺🇲. Cause that's a racist thing to say nowadays 🙄🤣. Please don't ever sell out Tom we got you. You won't ever need a major record label or anyone else influencing your music. WE THE PEOPLE Will carry you to the top and do so proudly!  You may been born in Canada and from there. But you as Red, White And Blue as it gets my brother and us patriots stand with you hell or high water!
Tom got shouted out on Tim Pools show today. I'm glad that he also reminded me that this song dropped today. Just woke up. This is fire.
The vibes is wow... love it tho
Please go on timcast irl.....tomcast
I covered  fake woke  . It's on all streaming services
All the best from Poland 👏👏👏👊
Yooo I Think This Video is Dope❤️‍🔥 #legendsneverdie
Here's where this me and I'm SURE I will catch up but a HUGE part for me is his usual ability to make his videos match his words so even if I miss a word or whatever I can get the meaning  thru his vid and also they're hilarious or so incredibly touching   I'd prefer him on a floaty in his pool than if it was even billion dollar CGI  I know it's not coming across how I mean it because I mean it to be a COMPLIMENT to his other stuff, that he and his amazing producer (❤️) are SO good that they don't have to do CGI batman when I was happy with the 💥BOP💥 💥BAM💥 Batman  God Bless Tom McDonald ❤️
holy shit this is doope
Let's trend this bitch! Like and share!
for me this song is not doing it, will not be coming back for a second listen.
Was unsubscribed for some reason, fuck youtube. Learned you had new beats from Timcast.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Tight man, a definite banger
Tim pool sent me
That was amazing! 🔥
Another Hit!! Keep bangin them out. Great work to u n the team
Nice Game diss...
This is awesome. I love it. Great job to all of you 💜💜

Fuck yeah buddy.  Well done tom
Tom, you guys used Unreal engine for the city, rock scene?
I generally hate rap. This is awesome.
You must be part flamethrower cause all you do is spit fire 🔥
🤯Excellent Video.  My wife says that Im not a Rule Follower... I just choose to make my own path and not let others determine my future... "even if I didn't make another dollar... I'm Blessed !"... 💯 Love this Vid.
Tom you spit out 🔥 again. Nova your talents for video and singing no other woman compares. Of course the legends that has real talent.
Word has it that this is a diss track to the Game, the whole industry game, and the midlife crises having, desperately capping, delusionally claiming top 5 of rapping, 3 hit wonder from 2004, former  ex-stripper, pedophilic wankster, C-Walking in red Hurricane shoes and and maroon doorag fake claimer delusional wannabe gangster
Wassup tim pool gang
Tom appeals to everyone. I'm a middle aged mom and even I think he's brilliant.
Heard about this dope a$$ jam on Tim  Pool. Subscribed!🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼
Awesome. Props to Jarred Potter, great addition with the visual effects.
It’s admiring that through all the haters you still dropping fire songs and even better music videos to go with it, not promoting drugs, guns, womens bodys, this is hip hop this is what it’s about not sum wanna be gangster who can’t keep it in his pants and mumbles lyrics, another thing is being independent is amazing, freedom of speech, nobody can shut down truth and Tom you spit truth nobody can get on the Same level as u keep making fire songs and all ya haters shut up, sit down, takes some notes cuz Tom is a real man!!!
You and nova killing this shit again nothing but 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Facts.
WOW   A W E S O M E!!! IT GAVE ME CHILLS  I LOVE IT!!!! Like always you did it again. God bless you!🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Holy shit...the visuals.  BAD ASS

"you a never-has-been"  Damn.....he even makes insults sound cool.
Pretty good.
This is the ONE!

Ok! I am utterly satisfied with that touch of metal! Beautiful fusion , well equilibrated and the words, as always i agree with... so thank you for this!!! Long live Tom Mc Donald!
Love it. Fuck the new world order. Fuck Rome. Fuck Islam. Fuck free masonry. Fuck satanism. Fuck spiritual slavery.

#HOGFAM. Looooooooooooooooooooooove every detail!!! "put you 6ft deep" is my fav part  the beat hittin' to each word! Need to bump in my Jeep. TY #TOMMACDONALD and #NOVA ( Queen )
Even Nicky gracious and lacrae have better songs and not everything is remixes
Love the Jacket!
HOLY SHIT BROTHER!! Keep these songs coming !!!
I am a Tom MacDonald fan but this song is just mediocre maybe it’s OK but this song does not slap
.....not only a banger but a breath of fresh air....
Hell yeah 🤘🤘🤘
100%TRUTH
I heard him say he’s a crip
“I WILL NOT GO MAINSTREAM”   *Censors himself and uses autotune*
Omg this is censored? How gay
Can Tom MacDonald fans tell his songs apart? He makes the same 3 songs over and over
Songs instead of remixes go get em Tom I'm sending this out to shady come get some Tom is the only one who can put you in your place without you having like a year to figure it out
Sick!
🔥
H.O.G. for life 😛🎶🎵❤️
Always 🔥
Great bars as always Tom. This one feels a little more commercialized than most but still a banger!
Dammmmnnnnnnnn, this went hard !
#hog
Each new song is getting better an better.. idk which one I like the most 🤷‍♂️ Riot was a awesome song
I let the ads run to make sure you get paid. Great work.
Just like chuch and calhoun never disappointed
Love your music always speak the truth
https://youtu.be/I8OIXBD5zQQ
hits
This song is amazing
Love ya bro... You guys killed it on this...keep it up H.O.G
Damn!!!! Shout out to Nova, her video work has become one of the best work out there!!!!
White pac in tha flesh somebody prove me wrong even shady Eminem Stan
I honestly didn't really like this one. sounded like your just talkin crap to a certain group of people while at the same time your using a lot of degenerate words just to appeal to their needs to get your song more popularity. Fuck the ignorant people of the world. I just see tooooo many contradictions. A HUGE WAVE OF POSITIVE IGNORANCE buries common sense
Love it !
TOM! THIS IS THE BEST SONG YOUVE EVER MADE! THANKS FOR MAKING THIS!
Still loyal fan but I have to say I'm not feeling the hook But just because one song doesn't resonate doesn't mean you don't have a whole catalog of straight fire I'm sure this will still be a success either way keep up the great work man
🔥🔥🔥
Fire! Absolute banger!
Damn..Damn…Damn….This right here!  Baller!!!!!
🖕Chirpin🖕
Just here to help drive engagement and the algorithm.
Damnit boy your still killing it. This is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Pretty sick track! Nice work you two!
I used to not like rap that much but since I started listening to you I am 100% into it. Such a 🐐
Another great song. Great video. You deserve all the success you get.
That jacket makes me think of @Fozzy 🤔hmmm a Fozzy/Tom Mac tour, ya I'd buy those tix.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 damn keep ‘em coming 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Another masterpiece as always Tom. The production on this one is insane.
This is sick! Love it ❤️
I see your in the mist of a Wave of unsuspected support 💯
I like the majority of toms music but this ain’t it
This is most likely one of those songs, that will grow more on more on me with every listen and will then stay longer on my playlist as the instantly catchy songs, that become boring faster.  Anyways... I'll definitely have it in repeat for a while and buy is on Amazon as always.  Shout out to Nova and Jared. Awesome work! #HangovergangGermany
Brilliant!! Keep it up 👆
Keep calling them like you see 'em, Tom!!!! Mainstream has got to be so p*ssed that you're making it despite them trying to hold you down. HOG life.
SICK!!!! Both the song and the video!!!!
Another boss move .. Respect   stay blessed
Why so quiet?  That's a good question 🤔 🤣
Ooo that heavy guitar. Loved that.
This guys a riot if he thinks he's a "rapper"  🤦
Dope
Fucking awesome
A pure Masterpiece
I feel sorry for those who haven't found this song yet
61 yr old woman from Texas. I got mad luv 4 u Tommy boy. Luv luv luv it
Sick
Youtube wont let me listen to this in the background it keeps closing out 🖕🖕🖕🖕
Not a fan of rap and didn’t know you. @Timcast talked about you. You just made a dollar from me as I like honesty and authenticity more than bullies. Keep it up 👍
Here from Tim cast let’s break it
They’re quiet because they can’t match your talent or counter your views on things. Inspiring music. On point and appreciated💯🇺🇸
Oh hell yeah! Rock Tom finally returns. I love it man. Professional quality video from a completely independent team. Thats the coolest part of this video.  "This is home grown, shout out all the rappers who have thrown stones" 🤟
BROOO THIS MY SHIT DONT EVER STOP MAN FR FR ONE DAY I PRAY WE COLLAB
Thankyou for your music Tom it helps us alot 💙
imagery is insane
Quality
WOOOOOOO! Today started off shitty for me but it's getting better by the second! New HOG jam and a new ACAL/Brodnax/Demun Jones/Dusty Leigh jam! Thank all you! My spirit has been lifted!
Okay. I like this. I Love hip hop(70s-00s) and post punk. This fits in there.
Another awesome video from your TEAM!
We where all hoping that you bring it,  damn have brought it.
Tom big fan from KUKILAND

Tom great video, Nova loved your editing
Hell YES!!! 👏👏👏 Another great song!
Intense video.  Props to Nova and family. Gonna have to listen a few more times to get the lyrics down. Thanks for all your hard work!
Why the upside crosses?
The use of crickets...👌
In a world full of fakes of course the real doesn't get the light they truly deserve, but let's do what we can to bless this man the way he has blessed us! Run it up #Repeat Chins up, prosperity and good health to all. You included Tom! 🙏😎👊

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Broo....how much more you got left??? Unreal.
My Friday got instantly better
💯 true, another amazing song! Never stop, you sing it we will follow!
Short and concise, no filler.. no nonsense. I think the spirit of Cobain took over for about 3 minutes.  I figured out how to play the guitar part during the song in real time, real talk, no cap
You and Nova never cease to amaze. You guys crushed it!
When tour?
Who is he dissing is the question
💯🤘🔥
Love ya Tom. This one was kind of meh, still good tho but felt like a filler song. Much love tho. Huge fan
Hell yeah, this is great  nice job by all on this👍
My least favorite 1 I've heard. Its ok but not the best.
Banger for real my guy, love the beat, love the lyrics, lol, of course videos fire, damn i wish em could take a risk and come back. HOG will have to carry the weight i guess.
Dope
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯🔥🔥🔥💯🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
“6 feet deep, that’s an underground rapper” love this line.
Tack on another ABSOLUTE banger to this mans list of epic tracks!
Tom MacDonald it’s awesome to hear your music and your words as always! Man, this one definitely gets the heart beating, so props! H.O.G. always!
Things mainstream rappers do: 1. Name drop. 2  Talk non-stop about themselves.  Unfortunately you just did #2.
Thank you again another masterpiece to add to the playlist graphic are sick in this vid bruv!! 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 thankyou again Tom Macdonald!!!!!!!!!!!!

Every time this man drops nothing but truth! Keep your messages coming Tom they’re needed more and more.
Shot at The Jokerr?? Get your popcorn folks!! Jokerr about to melt!
Love this sound! Great job Tom!
Keep up the awesome work you do. It seems everything you sing about speaks to me. I just wish I could climb up out of this massive black hole I am stuck it.
Tom never ceases to amaze, I am so excited to have the privilege of being able to listen to his art!
Those crickets are killer!! Keep this gold coming! The industry has been trash for so long. Thank you Tom
The video quality just keeps on getting better. Great work.
Production levels 📈📈📈📈📈
Let’s go baby
My dude slays it like Khorn, rocks it like Slaanesh, has the lyrical genius of Tzeentch and spits the illest rhymes of Nugrle.
So good!!
That under ground Rapper line is 🔥 🔥
Great song
Bad Ass Tom!! 🤘🤘🤘🤘 killed another one
Tom, you have really done a great job! I really love the way you sound cuz even though a melody in some of your tracks are quite melancholic, you still sound optimistic and aggressive! BTW the guitar sample in this particular song is just a damn ear pump! I have already tried to go gym listening to this and that was f*cking awesome! Thank you for your music and motivation! Cheers from Russia💪🏻🔥💀👍🏻🕊
Loving the new song as much I do the rest 😝 please please come tour uk ,we love you !!
Sick video I love it 🤘🏻

Damn
Not in my top 10 TM songs, cool video. Keep up the good work.
Your music is great but the issue with it has always been it’s not repeatable, no one listens over and over for pleasure regardless of how good it is.. It’s great but I ain’t gonna be caught bumping this in my car lol.
The crickets are epic
This video is as dope as a mosh pit RIOT..
😃😃😃
us against the world forever my dude -busman-

Their mountain will crumble, we will take the high ground.
Trumps new campaign track
Why has Tom never done a tour?
We releasing clean versions now? Tf?
Bro you're actually the same dude everytime. Love it.
Every time Tom says "never done anything like this before" I think "it's just marketing", but everytime.... he's proves me wrong and I love it!!
My dude, you've got to do a collaboration with Ronnie from Falling In Reverse!!! Either way songs fire!!
👍
Beautiful!!!
another banger!!
Dayyum 💯👍👌🙏👏😁🔥‼️ Nice one, hope this ends up on a whole album that goes this hard.
Wow what you and nova put out are truly amazing and should put label companies to shame. Keep being you and dropping works of art.
Posing much

Damn Tom. I really like the sound on this one. Ok I like them all but, this one just hit a different part of my brain and caressed it. Love it. ❤  Boy you better not ever leave Nova. You two were made for each other. She takes your music and makes magic. Talented is an understatement. Nova, you are gifted. Every video I am amazed by what you can do. You two together, are completely unstoppable. Love you guys!  ❤🤍💙
It was good but I feel it was missing something. I just can’t figure out what.
This video reminds me of Avengers Endgame when 2014 Thanos blows up the avengers tower
It blows my mind the way you and Nova handle your business, You and Nova are extremely talented and make one hell of a team! Another banger!
Consider it shared and downloaded!!! You are a truly gifted artist and love everything you do!!! Keep being the 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

I love the metal mix! Metal does mix with rap lyrics.. Need more like this.. Go hard or go home.. Love it!
Another masterpiece from my man Tom. Freaking awsome bro.
Tom you are gifted 💯%
The message is great. Yall do great work every time you put out a new song. But there was something about it on this one that didn't fung my shway, it's alright tho not every song out there fungs my shway, but I still listen to them. Thanks for all your hard work and giving us all some music for our ear holes. Be Safe
This Rocks brother.
You never disappoint sir!
Wow! Like a truth bomb exploded in my ears.
If everyone who likes this song goes and buys it,  it will easily be number 1 on the charts!
Why does this guy still have a career lol
This was most definitely as u said Tom, a banger
Not me jamming to this in the school pick up line 😂🤷‍♀️   You never fail to impress, and I love the rock vibe you gave this one ❤
Wow!!!! That is straight 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 I love the video and your bars is just off the chain. It's beyond impressive. And to be a independent artist, you doing this????? Yeah you are bringing it hard. Your hard work, you non sleep nights to put out work like this. It surely dose show and much appreciated.
Awesome video
Tom just told everybody death is riding get as ready as you can soon but you will never be ready enough take care everyone

He did it again here we go again someone done pissed him off yet again wonder who now
Makes cold verses needs a little help on the chorus
You are a legend of this age. And your music is always going to be a voice for those who just don't know how to express themselves. Keep it up!
Fuck yea I can't wait for the car test on this beat, made my ear buds jump out on the floor
Great song all around, gotta be honest though.  My favorite track that you have produced, the crickets and guitar. Your skills shined through for sure, much love to everyone.
🔥
Great one again the goat this one fire
Hell yeah brother! Another classic!
Why a clean version though?
Dude is fearless. Grown ass conservative actors are too afraid to say a FRACTION of what Tom is willing to as - I assume - an independent.  Thank you Tom for having the balls to speak the truth. I'm glad Tucker Carlson doesn't give you nightmares
The beat took me a minute to get with but yeah love it. The guitar in the background, love the sound effects in the back. THIS IS AMAZING. Thank you Tom.
Another banger by Tom Macdonald             Protect Tom at all costs
2 bad he's a free may son
A man in a beanie brought me here, not a fan of hip hop generally, but much respect for what you're doing. Keep it up!
Pure 🔥
thanks TOM
My kinda beat
By far the best music video I have ever seen and this new song is 🔥🔥🔥
I love the way that they are constantly pushing themselves. It's commendable and outstanding. It's easy for successful artists to become complacent or find a comfort zone. Been following Tom for several years and am always impressed by the amount of continual effort that goes into everything.
I love it!!! Like I love everything about this single. I'm gonna listen to this on loop for the next 12 hours. THANK YOU! EVERYONE INVOLVED! Tom, Nova, Evan, EVERYONE thank you. I'm so happy right now!
Let's go Tom and Nova!
New Levels for sure,   Once again well done.   H.O.G.4LIFE !!!
As of the time of this comment (3 hours after drop) there’s a 50% like to view ratio and that’s pretty insane engagement for YT.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Love it! You never cease to amaze you’re fans, We are Loyal!  Well Done!
TRUTHFUL WORDS BEING SPEWED OUT !!!!!!!!!!!! STRAIGHT UP !!!!!
Awesomeee.
🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘
Fucking 🔥🔥🔥!! It’s way too short though!! Needed another 5 mins at least. 🙃
legendary freestyle 2->https://youtu.be/TuicMslyNs8
I like it, wondering if you are going to branch out and tell us a story.
You’re more of an important artist in the independent movement but Hopsin is still more talented.  I like the song but I prefer your political content - pure FIRE!  Can’t wait for what you present next.  Keep up the great work, pal!
ONE OF THE BEST SO FAR
Very nice ,slightly different then normal but great all the same! Stay real brother !!!!!! Thank you 🙏
Love u tom ur best.  Nova always the best behind scenes.  Ur jacket reminds me of the the ultimate warriors.
Sic yo! The flow is real! \M/
Awesome! Never disappoint!
You and Adam can't be dropping same day. Both these are 🔥
Always workin hard to put out the best music.
I love the song! Please release a clean version as soon as possible on iTunes. Thanks👍🏻
fire
Keep ‘em coming Tom…. honest & objective !
Getting shouted by Tim Pool, we're taking over the cultural spaces, and it's a great feeling.
Lovely ❤! Amazing as usual!! Stop abortion people
GOLD!!!!
This is a certified hood classic
dope track, clean hook and love the VFX.
Tom you always put out a great song love everything you do
The editing is so good and it Looks better than most marvel movies and shows now
That's right, talk yo shit Tom, you earned it. HOG!
Damnnnnn how do you keep doing it bro....   oh yeah you're a f'ing amazing artist.   The fact you do this all with just your girl is mindblowing. Another top tier song. Just like most songs you write. You're a genius, an artistic rhythmic poet with a truthful message which is more... way more than most other rappers.
Tombo when is the tour of Australia ! 😅 you and the gang have become national treasure’s
Bruh adam an da Boyz just drop something same time
At this moment, this is my favorite Tom MacDonald song. It hits so hard. And the video is crazy!!! This is just tremendous.
They are trying to mask your numbers again because I have watched it 10 times but the counter hasn't moved. Those bastards
💪🇵🇹👍
Nice one
every time you release a new song, i feel like the first caveman discovering fire.🦣
Another great song and video. Good jobb pony boy. Stay Golden. Nova you are extremely talented
power cords and rap🔥
That production game turnt to 11
Had police sirens in the background  and it fit perfectly!!
Forever greatest rapper of all time my man🤩
Great work Tom keep it up!!!🔥🔥🔥 Btw we want to see you on Timcast!!!
NateDiaz209 needs to walk out to UFC279 to this song
Another 🔥 throwing song! Love it!
LOVE THIS🤩🤩🥳🥳
I’m not really into hip hop but this dude is talented and it’s so impressive that’s he’s done all this as an independent artist.  You’re the man Tom, keep up the great work.
You're not Just Tom MacDonald, your new name and title should be, Master Of Lyrical Alchemy and Lord of the EarWorms Sir Thomas of the house MacDonald.  Many thanks for the past few years of absolute No bullshit music. You help many people get by and get along, you do a lot of good service to the global community even you don't know off.   Thank you for your great work.  Much love from India,  Bawa Revant Singh.
🔥🔥🔥

Baaad Asssss….. just what we needed . HOG Army. Like the when it’s up it’s up dig.
Got them running scared.
Hell's Yeah. Sh*t Was Dope 🔥💯
Unbelievable
👍🏻🤩😍
Another banger that brings me goose bumps
WTF Tom! Why you gotta set the bar so high 🤣. Keep them coming brother your talent is refreshing in an otherwise fake woke and regurgitating remake world.
🦗 because I'm bored lol. Shortest clip ever...so my turn to say, why so quiet ?   Good song, it's nice to see you make something new.
Damn,  my new favorite! Killer job!
You're the best man..👍
For the algorithm
Yo dope video dude! But how you got better visual effects than Marvel right now🤣🤣
Fire!! 🔥
Best self produced vid I have ever seen from a privateer.  Great job.
I'm so loving the metal!!!🎸🔥👋👋👋
Hell yeah, that’s what I’m talking about. Yet another amazing banger to show you aren’t “just” this or “just” that.   Rock on, Tom and Nova. Love the vid!
One of the best ones yet, esp the video. Nova shines brighter with every production. Keep at it you two.
WoW Nova killed it with this video and it’s amazing seeing them add in a little help to make their work even MORE mind blowing! You two are killing it with EVERYTHING YOU TOUCH! *I’m NOT a fan I’m an entire ac system!* 🥳🤣  I hope soon we see a wedding, we know Nova wants kids and women don’t have forever. Hurry up I’m dying to see you guys parenting, you’re going to be *INCREDIBLE* parents and I can’t wait to follow the journey. And it’ll inspire a generation of people who are black pilled. Xx
This is straight gas bro! 🔥💥
scream Fuck the industry, but I'll censor it so the industry still monetizes my video... LOL
Fantastic song and video.
Hot and heavy 🔥 🤘🏻
This man could never let me down, so glad my wife sent him to me in 2020 as a joke due to his look, immediately was a fan. First rapper I have purchased since 2002 when I served in the Corps.
just another great song and video.  I love the jacket
How does this not have more likes? This song doesn't slap... It's fucking slams
This video is amazingly well done! Holly shit! Its amazing 👏 very well done you guys!!!
Youtube un-subscribed me. But I'm back
Fucking loving the rock!!!! I’ve been waiting 🙏 After all it was Ashes that got me on this crazy TOMOVA love train. Keep rockin 😝🤘
That’s a good one… A Metal Edge.
I've never been a fan of rap. You sir, are the exception!
WoW! Love it!
Love it, Tom!!!
G.O.A.T is such a dramatic understatement to describe you and Nova. Unstoppable. Love you Guys!
CGI next level my God 😮 and BTW interesting prod and flow too
Those cricket tho 💀
Bravo..from high school when I first heard tom's art till date... dude's music has taught me to always be myself and not follow the crowd.which is actually a hard thing to do but once u sit back and watch how far u are going..its f##ckx amazing..keep up the good work
Damn, not even 100K views yet? That's kinda surprising. This video is NOICE!
I didn't know I needed to hear this. The song is fire. Honestly, has put me in a better mood. Even though there's shit going on within my personal life.    Tom, please keep pushing out your music. You're one of the few artists out there still alive willing to speak what is on all of our minds.   Point out all the hypocrisy that are sown deep into the fiber within this country.   Heck, just today at work. Had a meeting. "A Karen" and "Goodbye Priscilla" are now considered to be surls and is offensive. Like what? Lol. Who crew couldn't stop laughing about it.
That was beyond awesome! 🙏💜😃🇺🇸
Here thanks to tim cast.
You weren't lying. The visuals effects were unique on this one. Well done.
Love ya from one Tom to another my man! Haha…you’re the man brotha! Tell Nova this is the sickest video maybe of all time! #Badass
Challenge for Nova. Create something  new with more movement instead of scenes where Tom looks boxed in frame. Love the work. Hope challenge is accepted. You guys  both have the talent. Let's see some visual expansion outside the comfort zone.  Let's get it!! Heyooooo!!
Tom dropped another banger and it’s not political and I love it. Guitar production is awesome! Nova and Jared killed the visuals too. #HOG
Drive this to the top.
I love your music, but this one isn't your best. But I get it. Just seems phones in.
YOUR AN INSPIRATION!!!!!!!!!!
Shits fire as fuck
You and Calhoun on the same day!!!!! What a surprise! I didnt even know you were dropping today. Love it as usaul!! Keep on keepin on.....we love you guys
🔥
NOVA! Yes. The Ezekiel analogy in the video is amazing! Yall catch that! Well done! Powerhouse!
Awesome EPIC  and all those other words that describe your music
Keep it going bro dont let the music stop love you work, makes my world sound so much more real
Tom, thank you for always just being you!! Unapologetically you!! The world would benefit from the words you speak if they would open their ears and shut their mouths. To many ppl think that their opinion is gospel and to many ppl sell out to gain fake notoriety. You're a ground up independent monster!!! There's no independent Mt Rushmore without Thomas mother fucking MacDonald!!
I love "The System" 😎
Hate to break it to you Tom but I wasn’t feeling this one 🥹
Big props to you both, song was 🔥🔥🔥🔥 but nova is a video godess!!!! Noone in the industry could do what she does with as little as she has to work with. The whole standing on a mountain of skulls in a whirlwind of skulls and bones was just awesome
Hell yeah Tom!  Great job!  This track and video are dragon fire.
Tim pool sent me
Not sure, I guess it's good.
Another banger!!!! Can't wait for more!!!! Tom you killed it again. 👏
I have to admit, this is good stuff.  I'm more of a classical/instrumental woman myself when I binge music, but this is really good.
Love the new song bud can’t wait for more
I'm so glad no one owns you & your independent ....
Metal riff is badass
DUUUUDDDEEEE . OMS😱😱😱 AWESOME
I've never been much of a rap music person honestly but this is and all Tom McDonald dose is great and truth I'll support him as long as I can and buy his stuff Because his real and has been forever his has not changed money has not changed him or the fame great song as always
Yes sir!
Absolutely a fan 1000% love what him & his girl do .definitely  gotta say that I do wish to invest in cds at some point bc I will  be blaring his music everywhere I go once I do 🤣
Nova killed this video 🙌 of course another hit from you spitting the truth 🔥
You seem to mainline current social vibes naturally....Indeed they are quiet..waiting for THE RIOT.....dead on .. again!!!! You might be an empath, Tom. Check it out😉
Awesome as always! Nova love the visuals it's a banger!
Sicc🤘
Hahaha my man's said he on the independent Mount Rushmore
One of my fav independent rappers
🔥🔥🔥
Another banger
What an amazing video and beat 🥰 I love the guitar and the visuals. Shout out to Nova and Jared...
The rock vibes in this is off the chain. Props.
Man, please put the lyrics in description for those who are not native English speakers 😅
This is absolute PERFECTION....from start to finish!!!!  🔥 🔥 🔥  Thank you @Tom MacDonald and Nova!!!!  ❤❤
Yes.
When do we get another new song with Nova in it?  We the people need this.
Another one for my playlist. I have purchased every song that I can and this one is no different. Been listening since the beginning and now I’m hearing Tim Pool shout you out constantly. Congrats hangover gang
I like the new flow
Another great one Tom and Nova keep them coming
Dig the song but hearing the dead space where you say fuck is a bummer but past that songs a fuckin banger, now im  finding the explicit version and adding it to my playlist !!
Dude....FIRE
Nice! This jam has some flava! (In the past its been near impossible to find the perfect music for the stairmaster machines...this one, on repeat!) Ps. Epic effects gang!
Tom got free promotion.  https://youtu.be/VtituXO5nsI
Your mastery of the English language is impressive. Every time I hear one of your songs I admire the flows and off-rhymes and word play. Amazing work my dude!
👀
Well look at that, I see this video was posted 3 hours ago. Yet when I check my notification I see nothing about this new music video.   They are trying to keep you down again with the shadow banning.
Not allowing me to purchase this from Amazon Canada. :(
That's a huge like to view ratio.
I wasn't ready for this....the drop nearly break my screen 🔥👿
Lol who in the world came at you wrong?
Great vid, good bars, great instrumental, good song
🎆🎇🔥🎇🔥🎆🔥🎇🎆🔥🎆🎇💣💣💣💣💣
Wow . Nova did an amazing job with that video. A great team and a great rap
Making crickets sound that hard is just filthy my guy! 🔥
Effects are pretty dope Love the song
I never get my notifications anymore when you put a new one out. I have all selected! Why YOUTUBE!
Why are all of his songs the same? Each one just has the exact same sound to it. I'm over it lol
Tom is going to be king!!! The “shitttt chorus king.” 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Tim Pool sent me. Keep up the good work
Never disappointed Tom "RIOTS"are coming and even darker then before.  Thank you for your music n videos. ✌Nova and Tom🙏🏻
Damn!! Tom MacDonald DEFINITELY changed it up with this song!! I’m LOVING it!! Of course Tom MacDonald NEVER disappoints & I’m a huge fan of ALL his Music!! He’s just showing he can make all different type of songs♥️ Which is OBVIOUSLY a good thing👍LOVING THIS!! 🔥♥️🔥♥️🔥♥️🔥
So sick. Skills are unbelievable.
I like it and greetings from Tim.
Not the greatest single. This was on par with that stuff you made before you went informed. HalleluYah! Praise to Yah for your life! Yahuah is the Creator of the heavens and the earth(Genesis 1:1 In the beginning Elohim created the heavens and the earth) and Yah gave His only brought-forth(begotten) Son, Yahoshua ‘Yah is Salvation’ Messiah(John 3:16 “For Elohim so loved the world that He gave His only brought-forth Son, that everyone who believes in Him should not perish but possess everlasting life.) to sweat blood(Luke 22:44 And being in agony, He was praying more earnestly. And His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to the ground.) and be brutally murdered on a stake(cross) and be resurrected on the third day for the sins of all of humanity!(1 Corinthians 15:3-5 For I delivered to you at the first that which I also received: the Messiah died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He was raised the third day, according to the Scriptures, and that He was seen by Kêpha(Sha’ul who is also called Paul), then by the twelve.) (1 Corinthians 15:3-5 For I delivered to you at the first that which I also received: the Messiah died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He was raised the third day, according to the Scriptures, and that He was seen by Kêpha(Sha’ul who is also called Paul), then by the twelve.) Follow Yahuah’s 7 easy feast of remembrance and keep Yah’s Sabbath(Day 7; Day of Rest)!   Yahshua literally means ‘Yah is Salvation’ and His death and resurrection gave us the Gift of the Set-Apart Spirit to be our Guide and Helper to do what is right in Yah’s eyes! Elohim is plural for ‘Mighty Ones’ and Eloah is singular for ‘Mighty One’ and the Arabic word for ‘Elohim’ means ‘Judges and Rulers’   or   ‘Judges or Rulers’! Hallelujah is properly spelled ‘HalleluYah’ which literally means ‘praise to Yah’! Yahshua literally means ‘Yah is Salvation’! HalleluYah! Yahshua is the Messiah! “Jesus” is Greek for ‘hail Zeus’ and ‘Iesous/Iasous’ is four(4) deities/idols/mighty ones names combined, including the ‘Zeus’! ‘Lord’ is Hebrew for ‘Ba’al’ in every real Hebrew translation! “Christ” is the Greek deity/idol/mighty one ‘Christos’! “God” is “god” is “Gade” is “Gad”, “Ghode” is “Gawd” is the Pagan deity/idol/mighty one of “fortune”! Yeshua/Yehoshua when directly translated from Hebrew to English is Joshua! Amen is the Pagan idol Amen-raw/Amon-raw!
This is the wackest shit ever.
Liked the heavy metal element. Wish there was more. More like pantera kick you in the teeth elements.
"I'm on the Independent Mount Rushmore." And you definitely earned your spot there, Tom. 👍  Major applause to the tunes and definitely to Nova and Jared for the video and effects!🔥💯
Nailed it again! 🙌
Lets make this the most played song in the world and start a RIOT!
This song kills
Crappy song
evey single one of his song surprises  me with how good they are
Does anybody else feel the incredible mystical energy in this song. It's incredible
omg!!! Amazing!!!!! great work!
Great production
Rappers vids got nasty hoes and shit cinematography. This motherfuckers making MOVIES! Nova! You're a film Goddess!
Keep doing you Tom Macdonald 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Hell yeah! This is a straight banger!
I LOVE THIS ONE!!!👍👍♥♥
tom you've killed it hun  never disappoint keep going babe❤️🤟🤟🤟
No Life got out of his chair so good one.  😂
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Don't take offense from constructive feedback, but try to hit 3/3:30 mark (& don't reuse toque/facemask)
Came here from Tim Pool. Not disappointed this song goes hard in the paint.
🔥
Yeah boi
getting worse Tom! shite
You rocked it again, y’all smashed it out of the park.
Who's this about? 🤔🙄
Until the chorus, kinda sounded like a Run the Jewels beat.
Best Rapper...
Nothin but LOVE!  Reigns supreme
H.O.G. FOREVER BITCHES!!!!!
Tom and crew, best wishes, Good luck.  This song, for me, just doesnt cut it, not my style. Respect, keep slay'n'em. I'll keep praying in the mean time.
Imagine that, subbed, and not a single fucking notification.  My bad Tom, let me listen now.
Excellent! Can’t wait to jam in my truck on my next drive. Loved it Tom and Nova- well done.
This is badass!!
Decent instrumental wasted on yet another load of nothing from Tom cringefest McDonald
Thanks for the tune 👍 God's blessings 🇺🇸 Great video
It's so refreshing to hear new music that's good. Thank you Tom and crew.
First thing I do is come home from school and listen to this banger
The attention to detail.  Graphics, swarming flying skulls.  Never have seen anything like it.  Tom's deadpan blue eyed stare with crickets.  SO MANY LAYERS.    At 58 years of age, I don't really understand rap culture and challeging/sometimes threatening nature of the genre.  I am trying to understand.  The music and verse hits RAPID FIRE and is something of a sensory overload, but in a good way.  Standing on the mountain of bones.  So much.  Amazing quality Tom and Nova!  As usual with your music, and no one else's this 1964 chick will need to go back and watch several times to extract more layers, depth, and meaning.  This song, video and graphics are energy and intensity.  I'll have fun digging further.  Thanks for making this caboose boomer appreciate rap music.  I NEVER DREAMED I would protest and march for freedom while singing rap songs from a dude named Tom and his woman Nova.  LOVIN IT!!!
I really like this one
Tom Macdonald Your Music is Always awesome and You And Your Family are Truly Blessed.   God bless.🙏🙏🙏❤️🌹🌹.. I just love that you stand up for the Truth.  Stay True To Your Heart. Your music is very inspiring..
The flow in the beginning had me scratching my head, but I gave it a sec and... yep 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Was not let down. Amazing again. Tim cast is giving you praise  I can send you the post
Nova continues to amaze, redefining art.
Tom!!!! 🔥 🔥 #HOG4LIFE #weallfamilynow
That's what's up
Omg I love it !!! Beyond awesome
Tom, I'm a former veteran and I like your music.  God bless you and your family.  Thanks to demonstrate that with discipline hard work pays off. Never quit!
Damn I'm a metal head...and I love this.
Awesome video and song!
Man, I wish you would make more stuff with some rougher guitars like this. I first thought you would go all the way and go full metal there for a split second. ;)  Absolutely dig this one. Still doesn't beat "Don't Look Down" in terms of pure boldness and lyrical prowess but good stuff nonetheless.  BTW. Tim Pool collab when?
tom your the best in the world ive heard all of your songs im only ten and your songs make my day thank you for making music that is acwaly good unlike eminems music
Best one yet
most producers say you have to find your sound, but then you become stagnant with that sound, but Tom keeps it fresh. Only sad to see that this track is so short. The only person better than Tom is the guy who invented the replay button
Love the visuals - you and Nova did a bang up job!
No1 boy allways
Top love it 😃👍
I want to hear Tom come out with another song like "No Response" or "Don't look down".. I love his music but when he go crazy shit hit on a different level!
Why so quiet? Joe Biden?
It’s the little guitar riffs for me 🔥
Yyyaaassss!!! You never disappoint!! I love this!! So glad to see you guys!!
You Even Have The "Upside Down" Cross On The Mask Dude ?* > "Toys In The Attic & Skeletons In The Closet"  Tom ?* ...mmmmmmm ... [ and i am NOT a hater. just curious about allot of revelations i've been hearing in your songs and noticing lately...]
Spitting liquid fire as always! Keep it up Tom!
He is the safest rebel of all time lol
Awesome
love the song but AMAZON won't let me buy it and i don't have apple ID
YEEEAAAHHHH!!!!!!!!
I’m 💯 Metal.   But I dig your jams because you are a true original artist that I respect.  I’m listening.
Damn, bro... Been waiting for you do drop something for a while now.  Honestly started to get worried until you posted late last week saying you were coming back.  I was worried that "Trying to Kill Me" had come true.  Glad you are good.  And this song did not disappoint.
Holy Crap, Tom!   You just keep getting better ! You  are The best Rapper Ever!  ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥 This is so FIRE! 🔥
I questioned this one when I first heard but man it definitely grew on me! Sick ass music video man! Keep em coming Tom and don't let em knock you down! 💪
This is next level. Tom is peaking here in my opinion with no sign of slowing soon. Well done sir. Not my first pic of music genre but I love all things music and this is your opus. You've done hip hop and entertainment a service here. The concept and beat and the visuals here are expertly delivered. I can't wait to see Tom continue to evolve. Keep them coming sir, we are listening!
THIS MAN IS UNSTOPPABLE!!! RIP INDUSTRY HACKS. HOG IS COMING FOR YOU. AND YOU WILL DO NOTHING BECAUSE YOU CAN DO NOTHING. HE CANNOT LOSE!!!
Loved it
Absolute 🔥
3.26 Million here. Imagine 3.26 million emailing their County Election commissioners "I DO NOT CONSENT TO ELECTRONIC VOTING MACHINES IN OUR ELECTIONS" WWG1WGA
👍
Hell yeah this may not be my favorite of yours but it is one of your best sounding. Your talent is still growing. Love it
Haha
THE GOAT!  They need to add an itune feature to automatically buy every release by an artist.  My phone would be “Buy all new releases from Tom Macdonald = True”.  And Nova!  That girl is a visual savant.
Now I like this! It's not trying to preach too me I can dig this.
So sick. Feel like someone really pissed you off and you just vented writing these lyrics.
Love all of your music! When it comes on I can't help but turn the volume up. Have to spread your truths.
🔥 . I'm not gonna type out a million fire emojis but I'll get the chain started.
"put em six feet deep, that's an underground rapper* 🔥🔥🔥 Tom always coming with the bars and the facts
Videos dope shout-out Nova, the song "it's aight"
Wooooo
Tom macdonald your music is amazing
Love it
Sick
Solid flames brother!!!
TMAC
killin it bro. shout out to Tim Pool for telling me about your new drop in a vid of his
This song is amazing, I found you years a couple of years ago web surfing for music and I was in a bad place, but your art saved my life, I'd always felt alone, my parents are divorced and unfortunately both sides of my family were dysfunctional in different ways, so when I saw this woke trend pop up it felt like dysfunction was being put on pedestal and combine that with depression and it got pretty bad especially when you think the world is as dysfunctional as your family and it gets really bad but then I found your music and spoke to something more than the world then I found thread and I climbed it, I still am and your music is still showing me the way back up, God Bless you, Nova, Everybody who helps you, all of you are helping people never forget that ✌️
What the fake this word is because of them !! Laying laying is the only talent they have   Presenting us a fake world in order to rule us not 50% but 100% ! Profiting 100000000000000000000000000000000000 ……………………… % times !!!
For the algorithm. Go Tom and crew!
725 views a minute for 2 hours. No label, no sellout, no cap! Pure bars.
I feel it!!
The metal guitar brings the beat to life
❤️👌
This song goes super hard! Beat smashes hard. Lyrics on point. This is a weekend burner! 🔥🔥🔥
🖤♻️📍
*🔥You The Man Tom🔥*
"No one knows your name, that's why you always gotta name-drop" haha touche
This song is fire! Loved the beat too
Little disappointing compared to the last couple. Still good just not one to repeat
Whats with the upside down cross on the ski mask ?
Hey Tom, here you are again with the good stuff. Keep it up bro
Definitely worth a replay, mah friend.  Keep up the great work XOXO
This gotta be a diss to the game
Fuck yes!
Uau!!!
Thank you for your music it's amazing we love you Tom
Daaaaamn

I do I DIG all up in it.Great work you two.The video is superb super fire visuals Nova it's fire 🔥🔥the lyrics are intellectually engineered,sounds very professional & I Love how you straight up address & call out whomever whenever giving no phucks throwing ya middle finger in the air expressing how you be seeing  it in your mind ,the articulating in such an artistic way brush I really like listening to the song...Outstanding job you guys!!!
Fucking Friday dude is the best day of every fucking months
Freaking banger!!!
You guys did it again 🎉🖤
LOVE THIS!!!!
Glad we have an artist who won't sell out and push the same old shit we constantly get. It's refreshing to have an artist doing it on his own and fucking slaying it! You rock tom!
No hate but, Bryson is better
Once again, Tom killing the game and Nova slaying the graphics! Straight fire!!!!!!! Best 1, 2 combo in the industry right now!
Y'all kill it.  Keep spending facts.. shout out to Nova for her skills on these videos.. Nova kills it
This isn't one of Tom's homeruns and he has many...I'd say this is a double.Nova granslams again
My God nova did work !

Tom, you never fail to deliver, this one is a shocker (pun intended) because you said it's different
Love this one!  You killed it again Tom! 👏 🤘
And Nova you fucking did the damn thing with the visual effects on this video love you little sister that was amazing girl....
Here a fan from Spain 🇪🇦
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 shits hot bro love it
Now that Logan Paul is a wrestler you should go on Impaulsive and gain some new fans. You guys can relate on at least pro wrestling and probably other things as well.
Absofukinlutely 🔥
I'll say it until it's a reality!! Y'all would kill it making full length movies!!! dude!!!! Power houses knocking down the shacks!!!!!!
ANOTHER......MF........BANGER!!!!! I so needed this today. I'm fighting covid for the fifth time and this gave me a push to keep fighting and don't look down. Thank you Tom and Nova!!♥️

DAMN TOM!!!! Not another banger with a badass video!!!!! Piss off the “woke” people. Keep being AWESOME !!!!!!
❤️
Shout out to Tim Pool for linking your song and talking about it and you in his recent video. Good to see people sticking together and lifting each other up. 🤘
Hell ya!
Hahahahahahahaha……Jesus….this is just boring….at this point just like repost all your music
Seriously, great ass song you weren’t lying the visuals in this video. Damn fucking good. Fit the song perfectly. 💯❤️💯🔥🤘✌️
Tom is that type of rapper that is not scared to speak the truth that's why he has my respect 🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
Surely you mean a peaceful riot?
🔥🔥🔥
Yeah buddy
Best song yet, THAT GUITAR RIFF........
I am really proud of Tom & crew❤️ Now you have a backer that I never saw coming. Tim at Timcast is asking everyone out there to purchase the song and push you directly #1 on Billboard. Tim has thousand upon thousands of viewers and he’s rooting for you Tom. He’s also a musician as well as political commentator and has the same problems with their “rules” for independent artists.
Sick. Ass. Beat. I love this!
"Homie, why you cappin?" *TRUER WORDS HAVE NOT BEEN SPOKEN!!*
Was having a shit day & then remembered Tom dropped a new video today 😃😃
Great job Tom
It's great listening to your soul speak
Yesssssss Tom !! FairPlay Nova !! 🖤👑👑🖤
HOG team! Knocking out the mainstream! OMG my old ass just rhymed!!!!!!!! Feel free to use that lol. Anyway I loved the song and I feel it. Bought this bad boy up! Thank you Nova kicking ass in the video game as usual! HOG 4EVER!
Love it!!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻❤️❤️🙏🏻🙏🏻
Love the heavy metal riffage!🤘🏻🖤
Tom keeps hittin’ HAF! But Tom, it’s time to take your mixes to the next level; David Gnozzi from MixBusTV would like to mix and master your projects. I think an engineer like him can take the sound of your music to the next level Tom. I hope you can get in touch with him.
Another banger!!! Dam Tom!
Dang, another great song & video!  Do not ever go mainstream, you are awesome on your own!
So as much as this has been promoted over the past week, I don’t feel like it’s that much of a banger. Snowflakes is definitely still a better song. Before y’all start getting mad or whatever, this is my opinion and I’m allowed to have that.
The reason Tom waited so long to release a new diss was that he couldn't ignore the signs the music industry needed reviving again any longer.
wonder who this is aimed at its clearly a diss track
Dude once that guitar hit I did a double take. Shit is fire
Not bad.
Amazing song bro, i love it, i have so much respect for you and nova, y'all are my music inspiration, great job y'all!
Tom is a good rapper with alot of shit to say but his hooks totally ruin any hope of replayabilitie. His girls getting good with the videos though. This is the best by far.
Another song has been added successfully to my gym playlist 👌. Great work ❤️🔥
This is amazing. The beat is great. I love the guitars, hopefully you use the guitars more in the future.
Ngl one of my first thoughts hearing this is that it would make a dope wrestling theme song
There’s a whole lotta seniors out here that just love Tom’s music. He’s a real truth teller!❤️🇺🇸
Not really my style but I’ll support him to the grave.
Bro with zero obligations on you whatsoever your new tracks are so highly anticipated and always fire. Always stoked to see new stuff from you and Nova! As always I enjoy that you do it in your own time and don't let people rush you to pump out subpar content. This art takes time to produce. Mad respect, Tom and Nova, keep it up!
Thumbs up before it starts cause I know it's flyin ❤️ Listened to the end, commenting cause it's boss 🔥🔥🔥
ALWAYS 1UPN !! Keep going dog!
Excellent as always. I see a skull sale coming up. 😜
This is fire.
Catchy as all get out!! I'm about to put this song on repeat and scrub my carpets. Stains better be scared.
The VFX is next level along with the music.
Another truly and utterly awesome music video thanks Tom and Nova the best team in music.
给
Let's make this number One on the list I'm buying this song So it charts through the roof ❤️💯
Thomas and Nova  That's our King and Queen 👑👑  FIRES. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥  H.O.G. Fam forever 🤗❣️🤗
This shit 🔥 bro!!!
Everyone is jerking this guy off. Truth is he's is no different than a trans, ultimately pretending to be something he's not, black.
That is what I’m fucking talking about!!!! Let’s go!!! 🔥 🔥 🔥 I need you to go on tour again and come to Colorado think about do the red rocks amphitheater that would a hell of a show!
Killing it dude. Always killing it
Already Tom hmu brother
One complaint.....TOO SHORT!  🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥♥️
The visuals are amazing, loving it.
That simply guitar chug in your verse makes the whole song. Well done
Tom... Ive needed your music today..I'm  Today has been a really rough day & came really close to relapsing  this afternoon. I woke up to the news of losing my cousin/very best friend . The sky has been super dark;  The Devil keeps whispering  my name in my ear,  & I want to answer so bad.. even though I know it's the wrong thing to do.. it's So FUCKING HARD!! I've had Sober on repeat while I've screamed and cried! Plz keep me in your thoughts hangovergang... I really need it right now.. because at the moment I'm lost
Started listening to this and my phone just shutdown half way thru the song
This the most bad ass metal rap I've ever heard 🎶
From racist to a goat That's all I said about him he's racist lol... Brah 🔥🔥🔥
👍
Good job all!
DUDE this is fresh. You're fucking moving mountains rn. <3 love another independent artist trying to make music to improve the ways of life for all people ☮️
Everyone buy this if you like it, it's only $1, lets get this to Number 1.
Wow. 😶
✊🏻🇺🇸
Allways said Tom and Nova had only just begun to realize their potential. While the sky is the limit for most, it is still a limit. And i belive you 2 will show whats past that limit.
Do a song with Chris webby
Loved 😍 it!
Can we just a moment and appreciate Nova’s artistic vision & direction. She keeps outdoing herself. Great work again guys!
DRAKE sit down this guy REPRESENTS CANADA 🇨🇦 😂
Goosebumps. Tom Levelled up.  I shat my pants...
yes tom killed it once again! tom is a freakin legend! <3
Great Job, Tom, Straight To the Truth,
Letssss gooo
Truly amazing and better and better as you progress in your career Tom, much respect you got alot of family(fans) behind you, keep pushing forward always
It makes me so happy to know there are still people with real talent and zeal, like you and Nova- who are not just taking credit for the work of an army of nameless people behind the scenes!
This one had better top the charts. Just bought it cause of Tim Pool
Bravo, my dude, Bravo👏👏
I may not always agree with your views but, dam I can't sit here and say you dont have talent!! 🔥 Love the rock touch, brings this song to a whole new level!
i guess it's just normal now to be so non binary, so why do you act like you're against it if you're like this yourself ?
I will never be Tom's biggest fan but i do appreciate good music 👍
0:30 , "Mir Fontane & Cardi B influence.".
Please Tom do some scream metal !!!
Keep the fire lit 🔥 Tom!!
YESSSSSSSS!!!!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Our boy done levled up again...straight 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Dope!
Awsome video..   loved it.  Thank you.
Glad I got to watch Tom grow this big.
So good to see a new Tom MacDonald video ! Friday is your day Tom😉 The artwork in this video really adds to the vibe. Another great track!
lfg my guy killed it again
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Damn who is he talking to??? I got to think if Mac Letha (or whatever that dude's name is) hears this song He's going to feel some type of way.
This just is another reminder how you the GOAT this beat was FIRE and the music itself was just amazing keep it up man I hope you never stop with this
meh
Not your best but still love it😌🤌
Dang this video kicks ass.  Big fan here
Man I love the new editions, did you get an up upgrade??  Whatever happened I can see you climbing the stairs to the moon Tom. You deserve it for sure! That spirit is taking you places!!
Dope ass video great job again H.O.G army.
Absolutely love it!! You are always outdoing yourself!
Woah...chills
The amount of talent and the way you have your rhyme schemes and everyone of your beats has passion in it... And that also takes time... And your heart will never stop beating the way it's meant to. Thank you for your time Tom. We love you. HangOverGang till death 🤘
Who else hit the thumbs up before the vid come on?
Pure 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Just adding a comment for the algorithm
Dude just needs to get into politics. Run for office bro. Make changes. Defund the media should be your platform
why are you incredibly feminine though ? you trans after all ?
Main stream musician: I’m going to need a Porsche, chain, and boos for my music video.  Tom Macdonald: think we could access the catacombs. I’ma need some hell-a-bones.
Hell yes this is bad ass you and nova keep it up God bless independent artist
Beat’s nasty. Flow’s grungy. Bars are as cold as liquid nitrogen. Where TF this come from, Thomas?! Your mind went places on you hiatus, eh?… Masterpiece. A brutal departure from your usual assaults. I fucking love it! Huge props to Nova and Jared again! For the first time, I was as glued to the videography, edits, and VFX as I was on your performance.
Again, a masterpiece. Love it, Tom, well done! And Nova, you are simply amazing! Bless you both!
Nova on point with this one
Been a min!! Love it bruh!!!🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲
Why the hell does he censor the language in the videos?
Got a shout out and endorsement from Tim Pool.... rare!
I expected a Phantom MacDonald fireflow, but I still think it's a banger.
When the first 30 songs on your playlist is already Tom MacDonald and you gotta add another banger. Damn brother 🔥🔥🔥
In these days of information, ignorance is a choice. It’s possible to virtually time travel and witness the free range enslavement of America from our beginning to present day by watching 7 movies in order (timeline). 500 million dollars worth (production costs) of education that explains the matrix of ignorance and incompetence. Mind cleanse challenge: Gangs of New York  Grapes of Wrath  American Gangster  Natural Born Killers The Genius Club  Assault on Wall Street  Idiocracy
Love your music but what's with the satanic symbolism?
Haha, tim pool is shouting out tom macdonald now :) https://youtu.be/VtituXO5nsI
All sounds the same. Your chorus always sucks. #Facts
Tim pool brought me here. F the woke horde 🖕
This so fire
It’s weird I thought about checking out your channel for the first time since you dropped your last video and I see you dropped 2 hours ago. What r the odds of that?
How do you have the right to say "everywhere you go is a riot" you won't even leave your private gated community keep grifting for money
@tommacdonald  I love the metal guitar in the song a lot.  Would love to hear some more songs like this with a blend of metal and rap.  Go fucking hard with it. So many of us would crank that up for gym sessions or at parties.  I'm digging it.  Love you,  bro xoxo
Video is great song is mid but that's okay
NOVA AND THE TEAM HAVE SET THE BAR EVEN HIGHER!!!!!
Banger indeed
Have you considered working with Neffex?
My mind is blown today!! Tom this is the banger the world needs to see and hear!!! And then on top of this ACAL drops 🤯🤯🤯 Keep killing this game 🎯 you nailed it!
Fire - as always. III%N.TX.FAFO
I'll be screaming fuck the industry to my veins pop 😂😂🤘🤘
Cue the speculation on who this is about? 🤣  Great track, Tom! Great visuals, Nova! 💙
Why promote violence? This is what kids inevitably latch onto?
YES!
Tim Pool is giving you a shout out on his channel too. :)
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yay another track with "whiteboy"  telling us how awesome he is! Usually it's everyone but the artist saying that but not with Mr independent! He's always the first to tell everyone he's the "best rapper ever" that goes against "the system" and he "don't look down." You can't blame him though cause "people so stupid." Still, even after comments like this we get "no response" cause we are all just "fake woke" "dummies,"  "snowflakes" and "buttholes!"
Awesome
Damn Tom, can we talk about that dope ass jacket!* ❤️#HOG🔥👊😎
"FOMOs always cutting into lines trying to fail many times before their demise. And when they assume to short us, they only make an ass out of themself."
R e a l
FIRE! no other words needed
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
DAMN! Banger, next level video...
I would love to see like a full medieval visual. Or like fantasy. See Tom slay a monster as a Witcher. Bad ass
Sweet! Now off to Calhuon to see what kinda Gumbo him and the boys have cooked up.
Fuck yeah.
Waiting for hulk Hogan vid Keep up the good work
🤙🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Fuck yes Tom is blessed!
❤️❤️❤️
damn this guy is fire🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥 🔥 🔥
Diggin the fuck out of this Tom!
Hell yes! You're one of my inspirations for the last lyrics i wrote  I just need to learn how to make SOME music thats not clarinet or uke and id be proud to release the words!
Fucking Christ! This is now my main jam!
Whhoooo . . .  GREAT VIDEO EFFECTS, Nova ... and of course, Tom, your lyrics are 💯💥💯💥 on point!!  Keep up the good work using your God given talent  🙏 to entertain your fans, friends & family. ✝
Fire bruh!!
love it you on the kanye west flow
Legitimately the closet WWE fan wants to see Tom walk down to the ring to this song at Wrestlemania.
It's already number 3on itunes
Love it!
How do you keep coming out with these bangers? Every single time it just gets better and better. Plus you aren’t a puppet to those demonic communists that run the music industry, so it makes it even better. Straight 🔥🔥
I heard of Tom some time ago but this is the first song I've listened to.  Righteous 👍
YEP...I like this one Tom. Like it A LOT! Sending love to you and         ❤️‍🔥yours❤️‍🔥
I'm sad to say, but to ME this song is just ok. Perhaps it will grow on me. Music video is fire though! Either way, I'm always happy and willing to support y'all!
Fucking awesome man!
I'm a fan but getting tired of repetitive themes and lyrics. Get back to talking about personal struggle and life, that's what people can relate to. I do appreciate the instrumental experimental tracks but they could use more polish. I know you have the rap ability and talent so dig deep as an artist and drop the ego, it's not appealing. You literally bagged on name dropping after name dropping... seems conflicting. I love the collabs, especially with nova. You have so many great song, "Dear Slim" is brilliant but I love the heart and truth of "Bad News". When is the next bf gf album? And where are those Tim McDougal raps?
FirE Bro.  FiRE.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The cgi is great. Well done
Straight savage as usual.. 🤙🏻
Always brings the TRUTH in lyrics. Stay up brother you have an army at wait.
Love it brother!!!! You rock!!! Get some!!!!
I never even liked rap until I started listening to Tom, no one spoke to issues I cared about or understood, things are different now I'm 59 years old listening to rap for the first time, I'm digging it y'all 😘
Fuck the trap beat, fuck the autotune, fuck the narcissistic "I'm awesome, look at me" lyrics.  Fuck trendy trap rap.  We need some real shit, not another narcissistic track talking about me me me.  That's just my opinion.
Ppl saying I'm crazy that Tom is with THEM and sold out pause video at 23 seconds see the upside down cross on his mask , this isn't the first time go back watch all novas old shit highly satanic she brought him into it ...Tom is a sellout ppl wake up
We need more of the artists together doing a protest song unity is best #GodOverGovernment #WeThePeople #LearnTheNewWayOfLife in trying something new right now but because no body knows me how am I to do my job for the people.?! FuckTheSystem
Man you dropped another banger hell yeah can't wait for the new album.
This is incredible thanks to you and Nova another one killing the fucking game and paving the way
Wheeewwww boyyyyy!!! Fire
well I'm going to keep it real. I love 99% of your releases. I absolutely loved  the video in this one, the lyrics didn't do it for me. I'm  just a speck of fly shit in the pepper shaker of life. Looks like plenty of people are loving it. Keep at it my man. God speed
Man this one is so good.. lol for some reason i can imagine some form of this being played while Max Holloway makes his entrance to his mma fights..
Tim pool shouting you out. I'd love to see you and nova on his show.
Amazing as always! The visuals were mind blowing! Nova is getting better & better, so are you!!!!
Ok so we listened to the song before the video and sorry bro but the video made the song  don't get me wrong love the song but damnnnnn NOVA you go girl
Nailed it, again!
Love the imagery
Nice!!!!!
⚔🐺⚔
This video is sick good job tom and nova both of you are extra talented
Thanks... but I'll do it my way. Or die trying.
This shit goes so hard Tom ! 🔥 🔥
Keep it coming bud you're da man
HANDS DOWN THE BEST VISUALS. Tom killed it with this one. I'm so happy to be apart of Hangovergang. 🤘
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 as usual 🥰🥰🥰🥰
Fake news media refuse to cover Tom, because they know if normal every day people get exposed to Tom, then they might start thinking and recognize that they live as slaves for democrat party's agenda.
The message is for us all~ Stay Independent!! 🇺🇸
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I can't get enough!! I wanted this to never end.. The beat goes so hard!!! 🔥☄️🔥☄️🔥
go on timcast man, he just did a story about how you wrecking the industry
Straight 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I told my teen that I MIGHT “fangirl” if I ran into Tom & Nova somewhere.😜😂She was surprised bc I’m not one to idolize or put another human on a pedestal bc God reigns supreme in my life & humans are mortal beings. I told her that I respect your work ethic & making your way without big music producers & of course, the freedom message with God at the helm is what grabbed my attention & impresses me immensely.💛🙏💪👍
KEEP UP THE GRIND TOM MACDONALD!! CRANKED UP ON MY HEADPHONES, & ON REPEAT
Tom MacD is a drug that am hooked on pliz stop you're Killin it too much hommie
Could be talking about himself and the corporate music industry but it’s hard not to also think of the empty Biden rallies vs stadium packed Trump ones.
86k views in 2 hours. DAYUM.
How many of you needed this banger today , thank you Tom , Nova and crew .
Insane visuals
Not my kind of music but lots of respect for doing what you want to do and not caving or giving in.  Keep it up.
That beat tho
FANTASTIC as usual....Damn Tom just WOWWWWW
Brilliant as Always! Love and Respect from Sweden.
I don't know if you'll see this, but I love your music and style. I love the messages you tell in your music. I hope you keep making songs as long as you can. You'll always be one of my favorite rappers.
damn this slaps harder than my dad
Tom looks like a Witcher
This one is 💯🔥💯🔥 I love it when you get a track and just get grimy on em. This one is a banger as well. That beat goes crazy dude.
Mercy me oh my.  Burning down the mainstream, Tom.  You and NOVA bring it forever.  Fire, Brotherman, Fire. Keep Firing away.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Those visuals are amazing thanks tom!
Unbelievable production!!! Had to listen twice to concentrate on lyrics vs. Cinematography!  Great job!!!
Bro, actually fire. Funny tho. I was literally wearing that mask last night practicing one of my songs. That's that badass
Song was ok. Lyrics and message were on point
yooooooo this hits soooo F'ing hard yet at the same time its so smooth and flowie
🪨🪨
🔥🔥🔥🔥Friggan LIT!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥
Fuck yes, brother, as always another bad ass song, thanks for being real, keep it up!!!
How the hell Ya’ll make this! That’s incredible production. I’m a huge fan of both of you (Nova). Amazing beat, video and song. Huge fan of this. I typically listen to Spotify but Ima go purchase this from iTunes directly. There’s no way this was easy and I hope more people can spare a buck or two to show support. There’s no one with this level of production except mainstream artists like blackpink. That’s unbelievable and gives hope to other artists. Phenomenal!!!! Love y’all
Good gosh i love you Tom!!!   beautiful lyrics giving me goosebumps as usual,  so much truth, so much real,  God bless you and Nova man!   This song put tears in my eyes as usual,  just beautiful.
💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽🔥🔥🔥🔥🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
FIRE
I love it just heard tim pool talk about you man . Love the new song just got of iTunes. Thanks you for this awesome music.
Tom is killing the game. Tom and Nova, you're both artists to the core!
You Held That Track Hostage. Another Banger from The #HOG
"Flawless victory!" "FATALITY!!!"
Aaiiight.. I'M HERE!!
🔥🔥🔥
this is insane i love theres a little rock theme
Straight 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
You displayin an upside down cross? Yeah on the ski mask.. 🤷🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
"Put you 6ft deep, that's an underground rapper." Fucking loved that line. You killed it Tom. Keep up the hard work and fuck the industry!
The g.o.a.t.
Thank you Tom for telling the truth as always.
450 irate farming tools. Keep up the great work Tom! #HOGLife
Dammit. I've never liked this genre of music. But I replayed a few bits of this already!  The name drop bit got me :D
FIRE AGAIN!!! 🔥🔥🔥
Tom is a Mac Daddy
"Every song nobody knows your name that's why you name drop" 😄😆🤣
Tom and Nova once again have outdone, this is pure video and music ♬  genius. Nova did an incredible job on the video.  Watching your journey and growth has been awesome you two are growing into the best versions of yourselves. HOG 4 life
I stopped listening to Eminem when I found out he sold out to the Democrat Communist,  so happy to have someone who speaks the truth again.  God bless everyone who is standing up to the Communist who are trying to take over our country.
We Love You, Tom
Tom ,  Upchurch, Calhoun ,others need form own label and smash the culture...
I subbed and commented on every video and watch it all the way threw just to piss of the other party as they watch you blow up everywhere.
LOVE THE CRICKETS!!!
Awesome song tom!! Loved it!🔥🔥
Love it! And once again great video production etc by Nova!
The Goat is here with another banger of a truth bomb!  Loved it as per usual 👌  keep being you, keep fighting the good fight and don't ever change. 😎🤘
Everyone should buy this song. It's one dollar. We need to support artists like this.
.99 cents yall is all it take to get this amazing artist to the Top. If you can't afford it no worries but share and get this out there. 99 cents to kick the industry in the balls!
Going to be honest, song was decent, but I like the ones that are more about the things people don’t talk about or are too afraid to talk about. Nova really did an amazing job on the visuals, especially with the bones flying everywhere. Super cool.
Two Thumbs Up and One purchase :)
Keep that 🎸 chuggin! 🔥 🔥 🔥
I am writing this to help out Tom McDonald and this video and this channel with the algorithm ✌️❤️😚☺️
Song and video are amazing as always Tom. It's gonna blow up, between Hang Over Gang sharing and now Tim Pool pushing it on his shows the industry will have to cheat to slow it down.
Crushed it again Tom! and Nova, Killer visuals! Keeping true to self and in their face! Exposed.....Loving it!
Dude iv been waiting for a jam with some guitar riffs!!!!!! Killed it!
Nova is a straight video wizard
Whenever I think everything today is hopeless. Your music, tom macdonald, keeps me on my feet. Thanks. I wish I could afford to support you so I am heat giving you veiws.   Thanks so much!!
Flame on flame on flame ON FIRE
Tim Poole just dropped an endorsement of you.
Tom you live like the 1% while complaining about them. You dont know shit about the daily struggle.
Excellent job on the video and another awesome drop Tom! Love the geetar and the bass! So sick! A+++ props to Nova+team!
Token dropped two this week and I'm like wtf.. I need a new tom "the truth" Macdonald song... and of course I jus needed to wait til friday....love it broski..you never cease to amaze me.
After you made The system I’m buying everything you make from now on. 🖕 em all!
❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
🔥🔥🔥
If you were woke, Eminem would give you the keys to his houses & cars. Never surrender
You definitely have my support!
YESSSSSSSS... IT'S TOMDAY ....AGAIN. HOG4LIFE....!!!!!!
Me : Is it bad that I give a 👍 up even before listening??  Me after listening : Nope…shit bangs everytime and the message is even better. I would like it again if I could
Comment
"no one knows your name that's why you always have to name drop" straight bars fam!!
This that “Marylin Manson & NF collab” vibe... And per usual, visuals as cold as the audio, yo Tom keep it up w these bangers 💪🏼  Shit that actually show how unique your work is while still being top tier, fuk tryna blend in inside the “hiphop industry box 📦” I know I’ll never find our guy Tom in some mf box sounding like the rest of the crowd 💯
Idk man this one didn’t do it for me. You got so many bangers tho man and I’ll never stop listening. Hope you keep succeeding bro!
Nice song, thanks for the drop.
Yay! That was pretty good. Way better than anything I can do. Keep em Coming!!!
Not one of my favorites, but not a letdown either. Nova great job on the visuals.
Tom has done it again, I'm so proud of you man💖 shout-out to nova for the work behind the camera!!🔥🔥you're both truly appreciated ❤️❤️
Wish I knew who he was thinking about when writing this song lol. I think I have an idea but I aint trying to sound ignorant or make assumptions.  His "screw you/flex" songs are great. Better than most especially when they are funny songs. Where he shines is when he shows his insecurities and when he's dissing the powers that be. I love his range of what he can do.   Never disappoints 🔥❤
Fucking 🔥🔥
I may have to listen to that one again.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
I support u no matter what but idk about this one Tom, I kinda love the previous hits.. However keep it up HOG 4 LIFE ✌🏼
🔥🔥🔥
Keep killing it, Tom.  👍😎👍
Never in doubt - but another banger from the 🐐  🔥🔥🔥🔥
Kinda reminds me of the presidential candidate rallies... maybe the Donald should sing this to Biden
Ummm that was pretty hard. Glad to see something different Tom.
predictive programming...New York nuclear wasteland 🤔
Thank you for sharing your talent. Thank you for being you.
Yet again well done and good job gang.
FIER!!!! I'm so glad to be on the earth at the same time as Tom Macdonald.
Trump theme tune
I dig the very slight rock vibe. Made me think. Please collaborate with Tommy vext!!!!! Yall have the same political message. And yall get shit on for your views. You're both independent artists now that he left bad wolves. DO IT DO IT DO IT DO IT!!!!!
Tim Pool has your back. Check out his video on it. He's experiencing the same thing With the industry and data collection/reporting as you do. They are afraid of people like you and he.
VERY AWESOME!!!
Tom, just showing love for what you do brother. You don’t need my encouragement, or praise, or my thanks, but you have it. Praying for you and Nova. Looking forward to more Fridays.
Oooooooh, I LOVE THIS!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yes!..... just yes!
Love the chris jericho jacket.
Love it Tom.
🔥
Another ripper
Excellent!
Love it. Production value just continues to climb, Nova is a monster. Thanks for all you do!
Finally you switch it up a little bit. Breath of fresh air. I had to stop listening for a while because a lot of your songs were blurring together.
thank you tom for not being a sell out and switching to the bad rap u get me through a lot im going through a lot right now and I listen to u every day to get through my day so thank you
Now this, this is what all rap should be like
🔥🔥🔥
This is awesome
Hands down he is in the top three rappers. Goes him Mesus and Adam Calhoun
dude can rap . i hate the singing / hooks
Intresting love the beat
I just can’t with you anymore this isn’t nothing but dark & I don’t do dark.  Wolf in sheeps clothing is all that comes to mind when I see your videos so no more for me! Prayers that you find Jesus 🙌🏼
I bought the song before I heard it for Timmy, but this actually slaps hard. Good work man
Thats just awesome ! Thank you Tom and Nova for this masterpiece <3
holly shit!WOW ol stunjust saying perfect done TOM graet song and video gote me jump up,,,,,,,,,,thx my hero!thx to nova for good work!!!!!!!!
LETS GOO!!! This is a BANGER! Bruh went above and beyond. This song goin to be blastin out the speakers on my Harley all day now.
Already being scrubbed from YouTube search
not as lyrically deep or political, but damn it hits for playlist... Work out song for sure... hits hard love it.
There’s no crickets behind my comment! Love it!
This was definitely worth the wait bro. The death mound and skulls being lift into the air, the lightning and chaotic background. Shout out to everyone that helped you with this they out did themselves! Your an amazing artist, even though I like listening to your songs about things are going in this day and age; what will you wright about when the world is set right and functions in the way it has always meant to be from the start (no war, no civil fighting or arguments, no hunger, no climate change)? Another words peace on earth....
HELLS BELLS YES!! That is a bad ass song love it brother, keep strong.
Can some rapper please insult Tom? I am craving another rap battle slaying....
SLAPS
🔥 Kickass, Tom!!! Nice change up with the rhythm and type of instrumentals!!
Keep it up, Tom. Love ya, brother.
This has nothing to do with politics so why do i have to search for it loved it #HOG4EVER
Maaaan. Nova outdid herself with this one. The video is amazing. Great job guys. #HOG4LIFE
pretty similar throughout the song but okay
Beautiful work, absolutely amazing work , wow just amazing 👏 💯💖🏋‍♂️💪💯
That was wholesome! Always waiting for the Friday! Cause it's Tom's day!
I absolutely love when u brag how amazing u r. This one is badass for sure
Spot on again Tom!! "OWG"! Hears you clear! Keep yourself real! Old White Guy approved!!
Been here the whole time, have plenty of Tom albums. Just gotta say, this sounded like hook after hook. Like a promo song or something. Not everything is for everyone though. Keep grinding Tom.
Still the goat.@tom macdonald.do some history story's please.
Im a big fan of Tom, have been since day one. The song is okay. I feel like Tom should have done so much more here. The beats hard, visuals on point. Im just dissatisfied because we all know Tom can go harder. Much love and keep doing your thing man. You still the biggest independent artist in the world!
Keep up the great work, Tom and Team Hangover. Continue to stay true to yourselves and spreading these messages.  Never give in, never give up, never sellout. From a 64 year old grandpop. 😎🤘🤟🏼✌🏼
Wow
I’ll never trust Tim pool to recommend a song ever again.
This man is different! Illest visuals I’ve seen in a rap video bro this shits wild! Oh and the track... only problem is it’s too short lol shits gangster tho 💯
Love the hard guitar. New fan here. Where have I been?  I'll tell you, I stopped listening to most music, tunes, because I learned they all sold out to the industry.  Wow,  Tom, I can't stop listening to you. Shout out to Nova. Well done.
were thoses shots at The Game god I hope so 🙏
This video is awesome 😎 Nova is so talented 😍 The song is a banger🔥🔥I would love to know who Tom had in mind when he wrote it lol CREEKSQUAD/HOG💕🍄
Hell yeah! Another banger!
Look guys his first song in months that isn't political and it still sucks he's already said the hook five times already and hasn't even went on with the verse yet bro just give it up
Nice effects on this one bro 👍🏻
Hell yeah let's go. Shout out to tom and nova for yet another amazing song and video keep up that amazing work y'all do and I'll keep listening and being a fan h.o.g for life.
Putting this one on the play list
Not really my kind of music but i like the message
The song is great as always, great work Tom, staying true to what you want to put out, you don’t miss. But this video… absolutely incredible. Huge props to Nova and Jared!!
Vain and pointless.  Inconsequential.
AGAINS EPIC  WOW THE EFFECTS ON THE VIDEO  INTANTS LIKE AND COMMENT
ANOTHER ONE. So far I have not disliked one, keep making greatness!
Good job Tom!
I've honestly never heard of a atomic Donald concert so how can it be a riot everywhere you go if you don't have any events going on why are you lying to people dude throw up
Weird… I can’t minimize the screen on my phone and keep this playing. I can do it on any of Tom’s videos….
I love that all your music, no matter the genre you try, sounds like Tom MacDonald.  Love that! You have the best lyrics. And Nova is amazing at your videos.
I had the pleasure of talking to you once on Discord because you took the time out of your day to organize a meetup there and it was a giant coincidence that I saw it on the community post, I joined the server and then I got picked out of the huge crowd. Regardless of what people say about you and what you say about yourself, one thing I am sure is that you're a dope person.
UGH!!! Great song....however, why is it so damn short? I get it, this new generation hates songs over 3 minutes long. Right when i started really getting into this it was over. Damn!
Another top tier song and video by the dynamic duo and great VFX by mr potter. Shout out to miss Nova Rockerfeller.
Sick song. Love it.
Straight up 🔥 🔥 🔥!!!
Tom and Nova never ceases to amaze! Another great song and video!
Bro the CGI was really good. I enjoyed it. Great work Nova and Tom. I'm glad to be a loyal fan and listener.
The video was better then the song Tom, I like your shit but I keep it 100...Im not gonna bump this one while I mob. Keep up the good work though, I look forward to the next banger!
Another hit by the master of disaster...TOM MACDONALD!!! Awesome visuals and great production. Love the metal feel to this one.
Heavy sound with deep literature
I predict a Riot, I predict a #Riot #HOG UK here for it
I was never much for rap or really anything out side rock or metal but I can get down with this
Would love to know what his HOG tat on his chin means???? Does anyone know? Would love to see him break down what his tats are and what they all mean to him.
This is something I have never understood about rap. Why do they always have to make songs about how successful they are and how the others are trash? It's hubristic.
💯
WOW. Just Wow. You never disappoint when you make new music. Beautiful shot music video 👍🤯🔥✊️
this is my favorite Tom song in awhile.  Listened to it for 2 straight hours this morning .
Come on Tom!! I know you can do better then a repeat rapper . Don't get me rong bro you got a lot of very good Music my Favorite is your coronavirus song 🤠🤘
"Put you six feet deep, that's an underground rapper" 🔥
que paso Tom!!! if we're alive and still not given into this corrupt Godless system we are indeed blessed even if we lose it all. keep it up homeboy 👊🏾💯🙏🏽
Love this one. Officially my favorite of yours.
I loved it, check out Adams new one..... its a bannger too!!!!
Excellent song! Tom giving the industry both middle fingers, nice!
That beat is amazing
Straight Fire 🖕🖕
Hell yeah, keep it up
Ye it's good
Love this, let all the posers talk s*** and drown in their own jealous tears 😂😂😂😂
I like most of toms music but this is too repetitive for me .
Tim Pool is pushing for you Tom. Time for a change.
Tim Pool jus mad a whole video amping up your music bro. Def a good watch.  Big ups bro
HOG FOREVER! Killin' it man!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
listen, all I'm saying is this would go SO hard at a concert ;)
Dude I would love to see you on Timcast IRL podcast.  Talk about some amazing conversations
So glad I found your music! Thank you
poppin🤑
💯💯💀💀❤️❤️
Love it. Love the message. Love the vid. Love the guitar riff. Good stuff, brother.
Very nice
Better versus…less chorus… eh, it was alright…
No one offers real feedback. Overall this song isn’t the greatest. Lyrics and beats need work, the flow isn’t the best.
Just found this dude from a Timcast video. Good stuff, hope more people catch on to his music
Eminem who?
banger as usual and holy hell great job on the edit nova yall are to talented
Bro please more chugging guitars‼️Metal guitars work awesome with hip-hop!   In fact my one complaint about rap is not enough power cords🤘🏼🇨🇦🖤🇺🇸🤘🏼
Sweet track dude!
Anyone else here from Tim Pool?
Great job, Nova ❤️  You too, Tom ❤️
bad ass, I just purchased on itunes. keep up the fight!!
Hey tom you gotta check out a canadian podcast called raging dissident and write him a song u have the talent his name is jeremy mckenzie he formed a fake country called diagolon  and he has a ram as his oresident that sniffs cocaine just a comedy fest but his rants are true and honest for all citizens fed up with whats going on today check it Out
That song was off the chains. The visuals were amazing. Thanks Nova for awesome video. I don't understand why you were put as one of the worste rappers. Keep proving you the best. 🔥 song. I'm happy to be a part of HOG!!
Visuals got better. Epic to the extreme.
Definitely sharing on my Fakebook. 😊 loving this video and can’t wait to buy the song!! #HOGforlife #resonation
I use to never like rap. It was always about stuff I didn't feel mattered, but your music ALWAYS keeps my attention. Thank you, Tom.
Always making good music 🎶 🤩
And I was here thinking it can't get better and boom 💥 another banger
Thank you for also uploading it to yandex music (Russian streaming service). That is one of the reasons why I respect you
Hanover Gang for life 🙏🙏🤙💚
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 holy FUCK 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
AWESOME!!! Can't wait for the next album!!!
You are so incredible the truth you spill is fantastic. I hope you and you girl are doing good
Fire.
Love it  When are you going on TOUR IVE SEE ADAM CALHOUN TWICE PLEASE GO ON TOUR
Great job Tom
I usually don't care much about MVs but that one was awesome !
I realized something funny about the main chorus: in addition to establishment media just being void of passion, their go-to method of silencing critics ultimately works against them and further ensures their audiences will be deserted. Facing failure is the first step to true success, but refusing to do so will result in one's efforts to stagnate into mediocrity. I'm not sure if this theme and observation was by design or mere coincidence, but it nonetheless speaks volumes as to why independent artists like Tom here are thriving and establishment media is languishing, even with all their efforts to thumb the scales.
This seems just a little bit pointed lol
Freaking fiiiiirrrrrrreeeee!
Tom and Tim (tim cast IRL) need to do a song collaboration! Maybe a podcast too.
Ok, that's a discovery right there. Dude, your music's absolute fire. The MV feels kind of old school in the style -in a good way- and the song itself... I'll be looking forward to your future works (and dive right into your past ones)
Yooooo this song was fire!!!!.
Yoooo. This video is sick bro!!! It is so 🔥.  You out did yourself. I love your music. The visuals was sick, awesome job Nova. I don't understand why they put you up as one of the worste rappers, they trippin. I'm happy to be a part of the HOG!!
Damn… This one is Fire
One of the few mc that speak real shit not popping z and blasting straps
Good, but not as good as "No response" and "this house". I miss that fire!!
Tim is right. It's on us to support independent artist. Force them to recognize Tom because reality is when they recognize Tom it's them recognizing us. When they ignore Tom it's them ignoring us. I don't know about you but I am sick of being ignored and canceled.
Damn, I guess the break was spent stepping up video production. Goddamn!
I still can't believe that at 59 years old I wait for, and fully enjoy a RAP video? To hell with it....just going to go with.More then a rapper!!
All day
Bro! Dope!  If only it was several minutes longer..hitting repeat after I go buy it! Love it!  Good job team!
Pro tip…. Save on overall production costs by never,EVER, using auto tune vocal effects.  🤣
👍🇳🇱😎
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtituXO5nsI
⏰️👑⏰️
it's crazy to hear your progress and whoa- Nova with the visuals. y'all really like a two headed monster my good man...
This dude is such garbage now lmao
Another banger love that guitar crunch.
https://youtu.be/KlCMsI4O7Cw ❤❤❤❤❤ lyrics
The effects and production of this video just put a lot of big box movies to shame. Another banger from Tom and crew.
Yo it’s so fucking heated out here the snowflakes around here been melted the second it started!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Another awesome tune
Just woke up and remembered That this came out so I went make some food and put this song on my living room sound system and now I feel complete
👎🏻
Never been a fan of this guy's hooks. I like his music though.
Nova made respect. Fire fucking video.   I’m really diggin this one Tom!!!!
China and Russia would shit down both legs if we elected Tom POTUS.
LETS F******* GO!!! LOVE YOU BRO ANOTHER F******! BANGGER..
Legit af❤ the skulls are amazing
sounds good champ  much love from australia.
As always.. you blew it out of the water again!
This one was ok. I still gave a like!  Gotta support my boy. 💪👍🙏
Beautiful  just fucking Beautiful  tom keep going brother
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 love it.
Wow cool
Liking this one but luv your political ones. Keep up the good work 👏
It's a bit short, but holy crap this one slaps.
New song  🧐 let's check it out
Nova spectacular imagery, great editing you are a true genius at your craft, don't get wrong your music is also top notch. Tom you are a master at your craft, everything you release is a surprise. great song, great flow, addition of the guitars, awesome. I was just a little bit disappointed, with a title like RIOT I was expecting to be knocked out my front door. That being said Nova and yourself are a huge force in the independent and label music industry Keep up the great work. Quick Question when is Nova gonna release some more tracks?
🔥🔥🔥🔥 all was telling the truth
The fact that he'd probably not have, nearly as much money, not as good songs, not as good visuals and be super PC, if he used a label BLOWS my mind. Big round of applause Tom, best independent EVER. 👏👏👏
This is ART. This video exudes and captures the POWER and CONFIDENCE and STRENGTH you hold!  You are a dark angel, doing God's work!  Prophet Tom MacDonald, speaking the spoken word to the people, letting the mob of evil, power hungry satan sell outs KNOW you are the NOT ONE to eff with while inspiring the same strength in all of us who listen. Not corrupted by money, fame, or all the lame threats, name calling, and slander.  True punk rock.
Simply excellent 😎
White pac....... I don't think so
Almost half the views atm are likes, that’s rare
What a banger🔥 keep up the good work 👍 hopefully one day you get the respect you and everyone else who wants freedom deserves🤞
Fire
I am a HUGE fucking fan of Tom since day one.  Not feeling this song, I’ll still rock it.
Banger! Freaking love it! Video is badass as per usual! Shout out to Nova and Jared! Y’all keep upping the game! #HOG4Life
Another Goat. I don’t give a damn what anyone says this man right here is goatee af Thank you Tom for being an amazing dude and making some dope ass music
awesome🤜🤛💪
FIREEE
I didn't come here expecting what you gave us, but I'll be damned if it ain't enough to cause riots from the simple awesome factor of it. Keep it up, Tom! #HOG for life, bud!
Love ya Tommy.  Was thinking about ya several days ago and wondering if you was ok.
Tom awesome song 🔥🔥 Miss Nova awesome visuals 🔥🔥
song 10/10 , video 15/10 you guys set the bar higher and higher every dang time
AMAZING VIDEO! Music rocks with a message as usual! Loved the crickets. Keep at the industry Tom and Nova! Love you guys. #HOG FOREVER!!
Thank you Tom, loving your music.
Another banger by the man. Love it bro. Keep being you!!
Your rap is dope! You are even famous over here in Germany.
thats fucking epic
I somehow knew this would have a hard rock feel to it. Any song named riot needs some heavy guitar.
Dayum….
I rarely enjoy rap at all. I don’t have to love it to like what it says. Fuck the establishment media. Keep winning the culture war.
Hell, I'm in my 60s and I think this is amazing! Nova is producing some stunning work that is surpassing her own high bar. Tom is perhaps the strongest independent American voice for anti-corruption. Please clone yourselves.
Awsome song Tom, keep up the hard work. Much love and respect
I LOVE IT! and yall, these graphics are SICKKKK 😎😎😎😎
I fuckin love it!!!! Song is on point, and the video is amazing
Spread your message far and wide my guy!
Recommended by tim pool 🏊‍♀️
Tom asks "why so quiet?"........ Easy answer . Cause they suck!  What other artist from any genre can claim rabid fans ranging from toddlers to seniors? At 59 I love Tom's music as much as I have loved Zeppelin for the last 40 years. I'd also be more than happy to put a senior ass kicking on anyone trying to do harm to Tom. Listen to Tom long enough and he becomes family somehow without ever speaking to him or meeting him. I know he has a ton more fans that feel the same way I do. When he says "When I show up it's a riot" he's not bragging or being arrogant or cocky... He's speaking facts. Tom brings all the hype and humor and entertainment of the WWE combined with great music and songwriting. I fucking love Tom Fridays!
Please do a collab with K RINO
FIRE!!!🔥🔥🔥
H.O.G fam for life bro that's 🔥 always great hearing star8 facts tell'em again bro
Damn! Did Nova learn After Effects!?! All of your videos are sick but you really stepped up the video production on this one. Love it!
wow just wow!
Outstanding video! Keep up the great music @Tom Mcdonald
Love the beat!
Jared Potter, we will watch your career with great interest as well.
Great video once again. The song is stuck in my brain and I am loving it. That spiked jacket is awesome, the chef's 💋
*LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!!*
Great work again by Nova!
oh damn. we're all here before this is even at 100k. Also, Tim from Timcast acting like he got Tom to blow up is amusing. (He just doesn't know all the work Tom and Nova have done to get here)
This is a real throwback
Not your best work but still good 👍🏻
Love the guitar  break downs, nice
Gotta say Tom, I respect the hell out of you. Keep it up man, don't bend knee and keep making good ass music
i thought after some time it would not always be about you. getting in a rut.
Dude you are putting record label backed artists videos TO SHAME. 💯
LOVE IT. KEEP WAKING PEOPLE UP BROTHA. MUCH LOVE FROM Canada 🇨🇦 ❤️
Likes plz🇰🇪🇰🇪
I know its upsetting that the billboards wouldnt accept you (they did that on purpose) BUT they did it because you arent part of that industry and to me that means YOU WON! None of that is going to matter and you will be standing when the rest of them fall. ❤️💯🇱🇷
Ok- you weren't just hyping.  Those visuals are insane!
Yooo those background effects look legit af, this video is dope
This shit is insane, loved it! 1:08 Favorite part by far, I almost with the entire song was just like this.  Tom Delivered!!
The cool thing about getting ignored by the media is that I can listen to this dope song without gutting  interrupted  by an ad
From hot sauna to this, FIRE!🤟🤟
Man dude....you and Nova never disappoint. Yet, another winner 🏆.
It’s too bad all his songs are exactly the same
This hits
Took me a minute for me to think of who Tom reminded me of when saying ‘quiet’ and it came to me. Reminds me of Mitch Hedberg. Awesome song!
These visuals are crazy, it matches the song. 🔥
Tom and Nova, you did it again. Thanks for being you.
I can see there is a video here, but I get nothing but a black screen. Hmmmm
U never disappoint tom and nova shits a banger for sure
Great lyrics but that's about it. Would never slap this in my car
wow. great quality and good song. nice
I'm coming here to support from Timpool.
Chart topper!!!
Haha, you a king level Troll. Love the video and song Tom! Nova, aces once again. Love this Hang Over Gang
haven't disliked a single song and this is no exception, amazing work from you and nova, keep on rocking 🔥🔥
Comment for the algorithm lol. Good job 👍
I didn’t like this one as much but Tom is still the man.  “The System” Was just a master piece though
I LOVE YOU Tom!! However, I have to admit, this song was kind of weak!!  Just being honest.
🔥🔥
that rocking beat
Yo can we get steve terreberry on here to djent on this track?
WOW  great video and  SONG... KEEP ON SPITTING THE TRUTH...
Tom, this is dope! i love it! just another banger, another to my playlist, props to the Goat Nova for the video, you both are goals and ty for making music for us! #HOG forever
Waiting for the time you'll do a collaboration song with Timcast. Here giving some support.
Badass! Been so excited to watch, never disappointed
Actually best single.  Love your music even the culture drops but wow.  This is different.
Big fan from India,your music is highly influential for logics than magic 🔥💯
Tim Pool brought me here.  Dig the track we need more real people like Tom keep it up dude!
Amazing Tom!!!  👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Simple but savage axe riffs, dark tone, sick beat, atmospheric presentation by Nova.  You dropped it heavy this track Tom, I love it.
Tom needs to come to Las Vegas and have a show. He'll make hella money and the crowd would be so big! I would go too.
Banger
I love the crickets in the background!
The most underrated
Nice
OMG! This is the sickest music video yet!!! LOVE IT!
Love this.
Get it
Can some please explain to me how the fuck this man made the worst rappers list … these mother fuckers done hit there head…. Straight 🔥
I love tom but at the same time i feel like its the same thing over and over but that how music goes. I like when he makes political songs personally. I will support no matter what. I also wish he would go on timcast. Love you both!
Beautiful, smashing, genuine... this shit's on fireeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!   Keep up the good work Tom. You are the voice of a generation! ❤‍🔥😝🤘
Dude, you never cease to impress! I'm really diggin that metal riff. Definitely going to be a regular on the playlist! I've been listening to "Flowers For The Dead" the last couple days and was just wondering if I'd hear something new from you soon. Definitely happy to see this! You & Nova are Legend!
Amazing as always🔥🔥 The one thing that comes to mind when you say "why so quiet" is why Eminem is so quiet when it comes to you, it would be great if he said something to recognise your talent and Novas too. 👊🏻👌🏻🔥🔥
Amazing video brother. This is a whole new level. Love it.
OMGOSH THAT WAS AWESOME TOM!! I'M 63 AND YOU BROUGHT IT YET AGAIN!! KEEP WALKING IN THE TRUTH, IT WILL SET OTHERS FREE!!
Can't be mad at that now can we?
# 1 bro! Awesome!
another hit tom :) love you guys great video love the heavier guitars almost thought you were going metal on us wouldnt be dissapointed but i love the song hog4life
Heck yes!  The people who are awake, not woke are the raddest in all things.  Way to be normal cool human  and kicking ass!!
Wow the visuals on this were crazy
THANK YOU FOR NEVER SELLING OUT TOM!!!! FUCK THE MAINSTREAM PROPAGANDA!!!! MIDDLE FINGERS IN THE AIR CAUSE I DONT CARE!🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕
I LOVE YOU TOM!!!
1:57 I really liked this part the way he used the auto tune 😎👍🔥🔥🔥 I could say he is very talented and dope but his passion is why I enjoy the music it really shows.
Geniuses! Tom and Nova , you two never disappoint! Beautifully done! Love it!🥰
You guys did it AGAIN with ANOTHER banger!!!!!👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
You give me hope for mankind.
@0:24 - explain please.
The skulls floating around Tom was very creative and bad ass. But what does this mean? In my own interpretation it is the destruction of all human lives that we are causing within ourselves. Politics. Hospitals. Big pharma. Food industry. Alcohol. Murder and rape.
🤯 that’s AWESOME 😎
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 as always Sober Soldier that's is a beast song keep telling them how it is  independence is freedom..fuck the system ..
"Put you 6 feet deep. That's an underground rapper." This line is hard as steel!
🐐 !
Just another good song by you. Not surprised at all. 😏
Beautiful job as always! Congrats on your well deserved success!
Genius Tom! !  Keep spitt’n the TRUTH.  What they don’t realize is their silence says a lot.
Loved it!!
Just another good song by you. Not surprised at all. 😏
Okay someone just got dissed
Jesus how doesn't keep coming up with such powerful lyrics
Tim Pool sent me here
Time to riot! Let’s get Tom’s song to the top of the charts! Don’t just listen to it but buy the song. Make the music industry acknowledge him
damn this shit is good keep up the good work Tom
Awsome great new tom macdonald great video
Again it’s always inspirational with ur music there is no surprise in my opinion ur the best rapper
YouTube is not sending me notifications of your Chanel
Another banger. Incredible what you do without industry backing. And thats why you're rise to fame is incredible. No one more deserving.
Gotta respect that he can't be bought.  Most people in his situation would have taken the money and then censored himself for more.  I bet he gets offers from labels all the time with promises of tons of money and all he has to do is listen to a few "suggestions" from the label.
Yes yes yes
Cricket lives matter!!! Thanks tom for another banger!!! 🔥🔥🔥😵🤯
DAY-YuM!!!
🤘😝🤘
guys who is he talking to in this song
33.000st Nice
I absolutely love this you did great Tom and Nova
Dude I f*cking love the combo with the metal vibes. Love from the Netherlands🇳🇱❤️
Dope as usual. But lets give a shout out  to NOVA!! Killin it
That a bop 🔥🔥🔥
Sounds awesome 😎
Rap with crickets..  Only Tom could pull that off
Omg I can't get enough of this
Just being honest, not my taste. Cant win over everyone on every track tho, keep doing what you gotta do.
GOAT STATUS COMING
❤️❤️❤️🇺🇾🇺🇾
Gotta admit this is more your style than the political message songs. I know they are important and appeal to a larger crowd, but I miss the bars you used to lay down in "Best rapper ever" and "No response." You really showed off your writing talent and your ability in those songs and others like them. You do you man, it works, just don't forget, we still like it when you go hard. 👍
Mostly peaceful protest Tom. C'mon.
Delivered.  Thanks
Loved the text
This is independent, just watch it and think about that. All of it is him and his loved ones. Yall know how crazy that is. There's a mountain on like a handful of people here. Tom keep going, lots of love from Texas.👍
Love it!!! Thank you!!
Meh, I prefer the stuff he does that actually has a message behind it. This one is just narcissistic and masturbatory. I don't care about how "hard" you think you are, you're popular because you are a good lyricist. Going on and on about how cool you are is kinda lame tbh
this fire on mute
Tom - Do Video Called *Dictator*  adn use the Backdrop Biden used in his speech
Look at Mister MacDonald with the SFX!!! looks raaad, my friend! HangOverGang for life!!!
This is amazing love every single song and video
There will never be another Tom MacDonald. There is no name for the lane that this man is driving in.
Was digging it hard until you used auto-tune, but whatever it's still a great song. 🤙
LOVE IT!!!
Always dope man! Even since E-Town. Keep pushing back Tom!
Banger confirmed. Tom and Nova you brought it again.
Sick ass vid, keep up the good work.
Awesome! Love the crickets! 😂 Excellent sound w/ rock guitars. 👍👍 Love the lyrics.
Was a powerful song! I loved it 😍🧨🎸
This guy is showing that no one can keep the arts suppressed and hijacked. Freedom of expression is our nature.
I fucking love his FREEDOM
Hello and many blessings to Tom, Nova and everyone in the comments section. Sending HOG an abundance of peace and positive energy. 😀👍🏿💪🏾🙏🏾
AaAAAWWW SSSHH!TT!!!!!  HERE COME THE METAL DRUM COVERS!!!!
That like ratio tells the truth. I haven’t seen that in a long time.
I like watching the reactors they're saying this is his best song one of his best songs ever if you look at his last four songs so you can throw the best well they would have to be a singer an artist they always want to progress and get better and better and that's the whole goal that's that's how you stay on top and Tom is the goat he knows how to do it he knows what we want and he gives it to us and he slaps it right in our face I love it
I could so see Trump using this in his campaign ads 😂 Great song and video Tom!!
Hells Yess!!! My dude @TomMacdonald always bringing us 🔥🔥🔥🔥 #Hangovergang4ever
Wow. Simply wow.
Perfect as always keep ‘em coming bro! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥
#hog
Fire!!!!
Shit fire af
Thank you Tom
This guy's music is theme music for the whole frigging world like its a movie as it happens. That first line esp hit me. "EVEN IF I NEVER MADE A DOLLAR AGAIN, I'M BLESSED!!!"
Another #1 hit! I love you and Nova so much!! Keep it up!!
This seems to be directed towards someone. Seemed like most lines were for a single person not just generalized.
❤
Fire as always! Love the beat on this one.
Ehh.
I'm pretty sure that jacket is how perforated leather seats are made.
Always great, thanks...
I discovered Tom 2 years ago and I was instantly hooked on his art. Every song hits different and I've only become a more of a fan with every song released. Tom you are the voice this country needs! Keep on kicking ass and taking names bro. And just remember they hate us cause they ain't us lmao 🤣
I knew it would be good but DAMN that was hot
You out do yourself 💯% everytime! 💥
Genius!
#HangOverGang ty Tom Mcdonald you are an eye opener greetings from Bolivia (in the other other america)
Smooth addition to the team, welcome aboard Jared Potter!
DAAAMN. So good
Tom you should reach out to Tim Pool.  Said he'd love to have you on his pod cast. Has mentioned you a few times recently
Absolutely incredible. The beat on this is just filthy. One of my favorite beats you’ve crafted. The guitars just add to it. Video is super dope. I mean Nova seems to always level up each time you do with her production. Song is just sick. Independent is the way to be, only good music we can get now minus a a handful of good rappers out there.
Got chills 3 different times listening to this- New fan!!
Not really a fan of this one.  Maybe the next one.
Visual and lyrical masterpiece! Absolutely love it
Nice lol this is some shit talking right here. Gonna see this on tiktok all over I bet
You go tom great job Goose bumps I'm a big fan 👏 Hog family 4 life
And another one to blow my ears back!!! You are still the best!!! Everything you do gets better than the last!!!! LOVE IT !!! Great job to nova as well!!!
Tom proves that if you are willing you can make it without the industry strings. Nothing but respect Tom.
Erm Sorry but I’ve only got one word for this!  Awesome
TomMACnoVA!!! Did it again !!! I don’t think u guys truly understand how important ur music and visuals are to the world !! Jaw dropping always !!! And an ARMY OF HOG THAT BELIEVES IN LIFE AGAIN !!!
VISUALS  🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The video was awesome the song meh
❤️❤️❤️🤣💯❤️‍🔥
Hell yea Tom keep fucking em up
The video and the music is phenomenal, but the lyrics aren't my favorite. In my uneducated, meaningless opinion, the songs where you talk about yourself being great aren't your best work. You have some great things to say, and that's what I like hearing. The production on this is amazing, but the song itself seems more like a filler on an album. Not one of the hits. That being said, you rock, and I love your work ✊️
🔥AF and I’m only at 1:03
Awesome 🇿🇲🇿🇲🇿🇲🇿🇲
Bro, this is better than I thought it was going to be. Production and Video is off the wall!
Awesome, thank you Tom and Nova......
Buy the song and push him up the charts, Be the new culture, Support the new culture, FUND the new culture.  We are part of the problem, But we ARE the solution.
"Why so quiet?" crickets* that's based!!!
Fire as always brother
Another awesome song and video. Props to Nova and Jared also.
Another hit! Good job. 👍🏽
This should be played at every Trump rally and Joe biden's face should pop up on the TV screens when the verse talking about nobody showing up for you comes on
Video is straight 🔥🔥🔥!!!
💯💯💯
It's not realy good try again homes
Short song
"Know one knows your name, thats why you always gotta name drop" FUCKING 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Reminds me of funk volumeand hopsin between 2010-2020
WTF  Bought this song before listening and so glad I did. THIS IS PURE 🔥
HOG!!! 💪😎🔥 🎶
Tom. You best be getting on one knee and asking Nova’s hand in marriage. You need her just as much as she needs you. Then bless this world with your children. You two would be the best parents ever. Sorry for being off topic, that’s just how I roll. Peace
🙏🏽
As per usual, another banger from Tom. I do, however, wish that he had a better producer. I have a feeling that he produces all of his tracks himself. But I've never actually liked any of his backing tracks or samples or whatever it's called. I mean, like Topher uses songs that already exist for his songs. Whatever. I don't know.
Tom in the comments, what's up bro?
Fffffaaaaarrreeeeaaakkkkkiiinnnn AWESOME!!!!!!
Banger, again.  #HOG forever!
🤯🤯🤯🤯Are YOU bitter!!! 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
Dude's tracks make me wanna drive a flaming tank through a building while I'm naked.
IN YOUR FACE XXL MAGAZINE NOT 43TH worth rapper this song/video proves it
Wow! Never cease to amaze me. Diggin it
Nice…. Great video work and bars
Dude I love the guitar you should do some more stuff like this. I've always had a vision of what I want my band to sound like and it would be something like this I've always wanted to mix metal with someone who is very intelligent with the bars only thing that can make this better is if you had a  vocalist like Philip labonte or Tim from as I lay dying just somebody that has a radical f****** voice overlaying " why so quiet; and put a tad more guitar riffs that that would throw this song over the top don't get me wrong I'm nitpicking the song is great by itself the way you did it I just think the way you rap goes very well with a metal core beat . I love what you're doing keep it up man
Let the woke die.
The guitar is a beautiful touch
Another hit. Amazing work and next level production.
Riot? Really???
Your music and videos always give me chills. Love love love!
A song called for riots. He needs to be arrested immediately. Reporting this to the FBI
Never disappointed Tom and Nova!  This is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Tim Pool music sucks this is good
Fire as always tom killed it !!!!
Good job man
Tom has me listening to RAP! I LOVE HIS MUSIC!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Hey brother... You let them have it, and I finally got some guitar with the anger vocals... One symbol suprised me cause I know thats not you today which is a good thing... Other than the little upside down symbol it was great audio & video...
Straight 🔥🔥🔥🤘 the video clean af as always!
"Even if I never made a dollar again..Im blessed." Absolutely fantastic Tom 👏 Trust in God ❤️🔒👑 Much love from 🇨🇦 🚚  🇨🇦
THIS!
Very nice video, Nova nailed it! But i gotta say Tom.. this was not your strongest lyrics.. I still think "dont look down" is your best work so far.. to be honest the greatest anyone has made in rap. Only competition for you is Eminem but he went woke and i hate everything about him now. Thank you for bringing back real rap music Tom.
LOVE IT!!!! Y'all out did yerselves!!
production value is really going up with each video and great song to boot
Friday...Tom's day still.
I'm addicted to this song!!!
Sick video dude sick lyrics.
bought my copy on iTunes!
crigne
Incredible as always. I love you. HOG 💜
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Awesome video! Would love to see a behind the scenes of this video shoot.
Let's gooooo! Love you Tom, your that dude. Thank you for all the great tracks that I bump everyday
👍 From Calgary
Awesome. I would love to hear an extended version of this song.
Tom went in from the JUMP... Didn't even let the beat build... Love it...
Rap is trash! Why is he apart of the 322 society?
Killed it 🔥🔥
🤟🤟🤟
It’s so insane and cool great work
Fire 🔥 bro, no cap, been a long enough sense you dropped on “Tom-day” and you didn’t disappoint, I’m still rewinding for the first couple verses, like holy 💩
First, Nova wow the video awesome. I love this one. The hook is cool esp when u say " why so quiet. And, I really feel the beat and your cadence in the beginning. It's close to " don't look down" in my top Tom songs. It's different and I like that
Billboard is whack if they dont give Tom number 1. Fax.
No one knows your name that's why you name drop.......that will always be a classic line
It's a great hit 👍 🔥🔥
This song is awesome, I love it.
Another  amazing song love this one so so much
🔥🔥🔥🚒🧯🧯
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥#HOG🙌🏻
The fucking king is back baby 🐐👑💚everyone protect this man at all cost 🙏🙏#legend #nofilter

Kinda like he is comparing a Trump Rally to Chiden’s paid propaganda infomercial

Loved it.
Song is 🔥, been playing it on repeat on Spotify since this morning
I like this. You both are amazing. Tom lyrics and Nova with the expression of images.
Sorry bro but Dax got you beat my man!
Sending love from Cali God bles
Saw Tim video  Bought the song  Now I’m listening. Love the music.  I understand now your frustration about the charts.  I specific commented during that saga numbers don’t matter Tom but now I realize if you chart our influence and your message reaches further.
Another masterpiece!
Another really great song and amazing video Tom it's great to see how your career is evolved through the years I'm so glad I found your music I love the guitars the metal sound that you added to the song great song this one will definitely blow up hangover game for life love you Tom keep up the amazing work you're doing for us
Hey Tom I would love it of you'd let me know where you got the spiked coat!!!!
Vaccines are safe and effective*
This song sucks Tom. It's just a statement song. Lame.
This is pretty good. Keep it up Tom!
Damn this video is legit high quality. Nova went all in on this video.
Not bad.
Smash like button -- kill the algorithm.
🤣🤣🤣 look at this complete rtard
Nova is sooooo good with videos!!!
Keep it up bub… glad you’re out there … loved hearing the use of guitar this time around… me being a big metal head would love to hear more beats made of up instruments … think there’s some real untapped potential there
Man, you're right there, like all your other ones.  Thanks, brudda.  Keep them coming!!!
This fire
Viejoo esto esta muy muy lindo y bueno y las camaras y los efectos y la producción! INCREIBLE! LO AMO
Loved it, Great work everybody👊 Thanks Tom, Nova, Jared and and Fam 🙏
Man the beat and the lyrics mesh so well with this song bro. Straight 🔥
Thank you for existing in our current timeline. God bless, good sir.
Wow!
I am a big fan and love the music and messages you are putting out but why are all the videos so dark like mainstream music and why does Nova go by Rockefeller if you guys are so against the system?
I used to have a black leather jacket with 2" spikes on the shoulders. That thing was so bad ass. I got arrested for a half zip of trees back before they Legalized and the cop drove me all the way to the jail wearing it and only noticed as we were pulling in to the cop shop. He politely asked me to do him a favor and when he let me out he would remove the cuffs and if I could casually take the jacket off before getting out for him to bring me in for processing, or else he would get harassed by everyone for walking me in there wearing basically assault body armor. 🤘😝⚔️
Yeaaaahhh dawg Straight 🔥 once again!  H.O.G. fam for life!
Banging track
Tom is one of a fucking kind nobody can do it better 🔥 🔥 🔥 AS ALWAYS
Tom is eating this game alive. No scraps left over. Props to him and the hangover gang.
Tm Pool sent me
Thomas “the real Mac “ MacDonald… what can I even say my guy? You already said it. Shit is a fucking Riot!   Nova motherfucking Rockefeller… those visuals. Good effing lord! So proud to call myself a day one fan.  Never give up. Never sell out. Never change
Another BANGER from Tom. Great video and song. When are you gonna go on Tim Pool's IRL show?
Horrible
Another legendary song by a legend!!!!
Nr.1 MacDonald
This one is something else, I like the autotune 🔥🔥🔥... Your production is dope bro🙆🏽‍♂️. & Shout out to Nova, visuals fire🔥
Incredible
Tom you gotta do part 2 to this one .
That Riff tho helllll yeah
Fucking Just exuding massive amounts of talent. Like just a uranium core is radioactive.
Wow! Just wow!
Can never do wrong, dude! All of your music is straight fire!!! keep it coming!!!
The worlds about to end and you’re releasing singles about yourself. Nobody can compete with you Tom. That’s old news. You are the goat. You are the literal savior of our generation. Write about the fourth turning or how the establishment is doing everything they can to not get outed. Or how A.I. is supposed to reach singularity by 2040. Would I shit my pants if I saw you? Yes. Is this song boring? Yes.
🤙 #hog ✌
Ummm songs tight but shout out to NOVA... She is a beast with these visuals bruh. Had to watch twice to hear the song, i was so amazed by these visuals bro. Lit
His songs are never long enough. 😭😭
Damn Dog... You NEVER disappoint us with your music ... Nova and Tom make one hell of an independent team! Let's see how many ppl use this video for click bait. 😂 #hogfam
Pretty sweet tom, congrats on the hard work
This one sucks. I said what I said.
Killer song man!
Your the boss Tom
Bro. ..this was ill AF man...legit awesome video and the music was a pure vibe. Very well done
from an old school rocker, let me just say damn man... freshest music i've heard in decades... don't look down!!!
Loved it. Wow. This is amazing. Thx hangovergang.
Love the visuals you were right absolutely amazing.
Awesome
Comment
Tom Killed it again!
Well done :)
straight to the top!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wtf tom! 🔥. Period!!!!!!
He’s gonna gain a healthy portion of new fans off this.
Awesome and the video is freaking sick 🤙🏼
Last week my girl and I were talking about when we thought you would release a new video and/or song and then on Tuesday or Wednesday I saw ur message of a video releasing today and I got so hype. This song is such fire. So awesome and an amazing video. I’ve listened/watched this video 4-6 times so far now. You just made my day and most likely weekend. Keep being great and doing great things. Much love.
Love this one! So glad your back at it!
Another one 🤘
It's been too long since such a fire Friday!
Man I feel like you wasted my dames time... the beets dope  but
legendary freestyle 2->https://youtu.be/TuicMslyNs8
If you do what you love, you'll never work a day in your life. Your success is your freedom, grats.
Tom and Nova, thank you for another great video proclaiming truth.  May God continue to bless, protect, and guide you! 🎶
Man…no lie…I’d love to see some behind the scenes videos of these videos being made 🤘🏻
Wack ! dude making trash these day!
INSANEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!! This some next level shyyyytttt 🔥
I like the rock & rap mixture.  Keep it up! #hangovergang
🔥 🔥 awesome job love it
😂 crickets
Great song! Tell Nova a fan is dying for a new song from her! ❤
My eyes were glued to the screen through the whole video. Awesome video.🔥🔥🔥
Damn, gave me goosies!
Damm Tom🔥

Reported
It's awesome how much you're able to get a different type of music and yet is STILL 🔥🔥 like most people couldn't do this they have to stick with the Sams old shit you're different in all your music it's got depth and reach and just all around amazing 👌👌
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
I'm glad this song is NOT about starting a riot. No one needs that sh*t. 🤪 Love the new video direction and different sound. I need to listen to this not on my cell phone, I didn't hear any bass.
Your girl killed it
High Quality stuff .. Fire man ❤️‍🔥💥
I thought you were this is 6th  IDK
Keep spittin bro!!! 🔥🔥💯
I have what’s probably a stupid question…..I pay for iTunes streaming monthly service. When I download your songs do you get paid from iTunes? I never see an option to “buy” your song? I want to make sure you’re being supported via my downloads. Let me know……🙏🏽
Hmm
No i miodzio :)
These edits are getting insane bro! Love the song too, keeping slaying big homie.
this is the best thing since limp bizket
Man on 🔥
When I first heard this song 43 minutes ago, wasn’t impressed. Now, these days, I guess I’ll admit it’s growing on me.
Honestly I get chills watching this the way you look at the camera so intense kind of scary loving it!!! The Rock Nova
Gonna go #1 again! And again the media will try and ignore! Funny thing it’s getting harder and harder for them to hide him! Another banger bro!
🔥
You doing right!!! Love this
Tom you are in my book the best rapper out there. And I'm from the original rap era. Thank you
Dude those visuals were on point! Sick set Tom!
ALWAYS dig Tom's videos! Him and Nova have such a talent for music! I always get cold chills as the videos play. Like my goodness another hit!💙
Tom you sure you didn’t sell your devil? Haha. Your on fire!
Love Your Flexing tracks... Such A VIBE...I..
That was pretty good tom, a little short on the length though. However,  that was really good, I really enjoyed the imagery that was perfect
Goooood daaaaamn booooiii
Right
Okay now. Video was awesome. And, I just was dancing. Like with my feet. Lol. Appreciatecha.
That was a really amazing song and the video was sick
I want that spiked leather jacket
Please go on Tour Tom!!!! We would love to see you and have a night where we can see you perform!
chirp chirp
Damn
Kill it
Thank you🙌💚
That was hot shit! shooting shots and don't even have to name drop hahaha killem Tom killem!!!! You and your squad are fucking legends
🔥🔥🔥😎🔥🔥🔥
Different type of track from the man Tom, dig the anger fueled vibes. Hard guitar hits make me wanna riot! H.O.G 4 L
Tom is killing it🔥🔥🔥 This might be my new favorite song of his!!!
That fucking jacket though
Keep doin' what youre doin.
🔥
AMAZING 🔥🔥🔥🔥💜
Tom can you please make a metal core/rap song? Really love your stuff and I'm a huge metal guy. I feel like you would knock it out of the park 😈
Legit 🔥 (per usual) the cgi is freakin' awesome!  Yet another hit. You're an animal my man!   perfect timing with Tim Pool on fire about making noise in the music industry. He's your new PR man telling everybody to buy it. On one hand it's funny because you sell millions on your own but on the other it's cool he's jumping on the band wagon to break open the music industry and their bullshit.
Am blessed🙏
Gives me the don't look down vibes
Look like I'm a girl but I'm in my mom's account
This hit so hard, damn, I love this
Tom kills another vid but his lyrics are always off the hook. I'm a older person that loves his music thx to my 23 yr old son. I love that he is independent doing his own thing. And all the hate he gets for his hair love it braided love it down. I say cont to do you Tom I do believe your name will go down in history. Now haters go hate.
Badass Tom!! Needed that energy!!! 💯🤘🤘🤘
My man! TOM MACDONALD and Nova !!!!  Love this, listening over and over and over.
Bro I will be honest I highly dislike rap but you got me. I honestly love it
Worth the wait - as always! ❤️❤️ 🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥😊
This is from my sister I love you McDonald's
Talented people don't need the machine to make things happen.  💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
The whole production team of this music video needs some claps! 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👂👏👏👏👏👃👏👏👏🦶👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🦵👏👏
Do we expect anything less of Tom now? this dude BEEN dropping gems for a minute now. Fuck yeah always coming with the dope tracks and extremely well visuals!
Fuck yeah!!! Done purchased the song. Much love to you and Nova!
Tom. You are absolutely correct with them facts. You will remain blessed no matter what happens in your lifetime. Keep bangin them out like that and you'll always remain on top. 💯%🔥
Badass brother love it you and Nova are awesome and great people much love and respect for yall 💯💯🤘🤘👍👍💯💯
Badass!
This is incredible.
NOVA done a fantastic job with the video - AS ALWAYS
HA even the cricket chirps were on beat!! Git it Tom!!!
Man Nova's video skills are out of this world.
As always - visuals are stunning!
Shit dope bro
HOG fuck yesssssssss
Best song by Tom in my opinion
Bro the bot infestations Amplitude here is fucking nuts, shit's worse than twitter.  DO NOT CLICK ON THEIR LINKS
Always entertains…..🙏🏽💪🏻
🔥🔥🔥
Tom is the 5th worst artist of the past 10 years. Crypt, gawne, Jack Harlow are my top 3. But I will admit, this track is not too bad
Look Tom, I'm a long time fan.  The one thing I truly despise about rap is the "I‘m the bestest most awesome look at me" childishness.  It always sounds like people with little self esteem trying to sound big, and that arrogance is unflattering.  Real men Don't have to tell you they are great.  I look forwards to more songs not about your vanity.  Peace.
I'm 187 years old and this is a banger.  Trump Won
Like the rock beat  man. The scratch guitar licks. Nice. Watch out man. You could become a rock star!!! :)
Damn good video still doing it so good
Outdid yourselves AGAIN..... #Hangovergang it's 🔥 💀 love you Tom and Nova....
New H.O.G.video !? Made my day right here!
🔥🔥🔥 insane Tom
*Fiery but mostly peacefull white boy fall!*
A Tom Macdonald song with an actually good chorus? Is this magic?
I love TM. I just wish he’d switch up his chorus formula. His songs all lose momentum when the chorus kicks in. Still, I love him.
Hell yeah
Amazing.
Another banger! Love it!
I usually like his music but this was kinda whack. Ah well.
I usually don't like his music alot, just the lyrics and message. This one i like the flow and beat alot
love the song, but you do not have to explain you!!! never. because we do not care. nobody does its just the propaganda and media. never forget, we already know what you are saying. you are very good at lyrics,. i give you a 12 oatta 10, only EM is infinite, for now .
Dope   Always  All ways
GUYS stop trying to sound poetic in the comments its annoying lmao.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Complete 🔥🔥🔥. Amazing visuals! Shared this on all my feeds. Do you Tom! #HOG4L
That scene of skulls damn
🔥 fire
🔥 yet again!
Dude this is amazing. keep killing it Tom!
This song reminds me of the crowds of tens of thousands coming out to see Trump and the dozens of people coming out to see "the most popular president in history". It was obviously a fair election, because I don't want to be cancelled and I know the rules. Just sayin'...
Awesome ....#HOG ❤🇨🇦
Oh my god, bro! Not only was the song dope but THIS FUCKING VIDEO IS INSANE!!! Great job as always, Tom! Never stop and keep killing it!!! 🔥👹🔥
RIOT!
Tom & Nova, you make the apocalypse look sexy. The video production on this one is pure 🔥.  You two make an incredible team and we appreciate you.   ☠️💀☠️
Hell yeah, love this
Man the visuals in this video. Tom coming back hard🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wow! Excellent! So creative. And truth!
Bless 🫂🔥🔥🔥
He must be featured with Tekken.
If I may be completely honest, I don’t particularly care for the flow of the song I found that something is missing but can’t put my finger on the trigger. However, the lyrics are on point, and the production of the video is absolutely amazing. NOVA YOU ARE A GENIUS AT YOUR CRAFT AND BOTH INDEPENDENT ARTISTS….❤❤❤! I do own the Brave Album and really loved that so much, keep pushing the boundaries Tom, still a big fan! 💪💪💪💪💪❤
Killing it! As always... Much Love guys! ❤️
Changing your style?
It was just okay for me. I feel like this would be a good intro in a concert setting. Before I saw I'm not digging it. I've heard this before time and time again in better songs to produce. Here come the haters.
Damn bro you went in hard on this mane! I cannot wait to get off work and play it in my car on the system!!!!
You see that upside down Cross✝️ flashes on 00:23 ? It’s quick but it’s relevant. They got him.
Bro, mad love Tom - I have to suggest.... idk how either of you feel about one another, but I'm a fan of you and this guy Bones.... Imagining a collab where your minds come together.... mindblowingshitmighthappen  OL' MACDONALD HAD A SESH
Fuck Yeah Tom!!! Now that's a riot I can get behind!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
👽👽👽
Another hit bro, love the new song, sick video man, loved it, awesome effects. Keep on doing what u do man. Hang over gang forever brother 👍💪😊
💗💗💗freaking awesome!!
YOUR MUSIC has the best content hands down!!. Everything else falls right into place.
Love the lyrics, it’s not my normal type instrumental. And it’s ok. Not taking away anything from the song, I’m sure a lot of people will love it. I personally think “I hate hip hop” is still the hardiest hitting song you made and I love that song, but keep up the great work and don’t stop trying new things
I didnt get a notification...Tim Pool posted it.....  Shadow banning you bro.....................
Dig it?  That’s an understatement.  This me had me at the intro.  Adding to my Hangover playlist now.
One of the most real and based musicians alive today slowly becoming iconic, ,keep up the inspiring music Tom!  Why can't other artists talk about stuff that actually matters? God, I feel pity for our population.
kick ass video. awesome song
This track is dope
🔥
Tom, you guys did it again! Awesome video. I love the production work. But for me, the jacket is the coolest anti-hug, stay away from me thing I’ve seen in a while!
Hell yeah man! Killed it like always! Forever my favorite rapper! Nothin like waking up, throwing on a HOG shirt and listening to the next song that’s gunna take over the internet 🙏🏼
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥   From South Africa 🇿🇦
Why is this not number one?
HELL YEAH BRO. The rock Hip/Hop is awesome. Been hooked since Ashes to Ashes
My only complaint is it's too short
Great job Nova. Tom is a Riot.
FIRE !!!!!!!!!!!
❤️❤️❤️
This, my good sir, is a banger.
Hey Tom Only just discovered you and love what your doing with your music and where you are pushing your lyrics to. I have a song I would like you to listen to and maybe write lyrics to.  I wrote this song like 16 years ago now,  The songs I always wrote were both anti government and anti religious,  I linked it so you could hear the song Tyrannicide ( tyrant killer ) I think you could write something memorable with it.   https://youtu.be/ar_frQs0sas?t=183   There are 2 other songs one I did not write I just updated it and the other (the first song) is mostly mine but I always started playing with my warm up songs on bass the Adams family theme and then the Munster's theme, then I would just go into my song and I happened to like how well they blended so dropping the Adam's family song and a little twist here and there it became that song.
Tom & Nova, please consider going to Rumble.  You're being censored on this platform.
Great video & song brother!
Always sharing on WIMKIN
Love that this is playing...look over to what on deck and Adams next in line on my list. Its going to be a good Friday. Two of my favorites releasing music. I think my head might just explode.
The crickets are nice touch.
Another masterpiece Tom!! This one is def a banger!!  I really love the line "I will not go mainstream dog, you know I hate pop, I'll be screaming fuck the industry until my veins pop" hell yeah!! Fuck the mainstream machine!!
sick visuals
Great song fire🔥
I was waiting to see Nova's SFX skills. Very nice!!
Em who!!?? This is the real GOAT….
Do you ever regret getting mainstream media influenced tattoos,hair, teeth/ grills, how you talk, act, sing , dress?
🔥🔥
possibly his best song??????
Great visuals, song is clap rap not what I expect from Tom these days
This is great tom, but why did you censor your swearing?
I love you! 😘❤️ Keep speaking the truth 💯
I really like the sound to this one a lot! Nova really out did herself with the video too!!
AMAZING visuals ... wow.  You and Nova have really outdone yourselves.
Probably your best video visually so far, I dig it.
The crickets though… another masterpiece ! Thank you
Would be way better if didn’t look like a clown brainwashed by the media to look like a clown
More piff 🍻🖖
amazing dudeski
Holy shit Tom that’s freakin awesome.
Who is he talking to directly in this song? Is this Mac Lethal diss track #3 or is it somebody else?
Love it man
Lyrics a bit weaker than usual but I liked the music, the beat more than usual. I'm a metalhead and you're basically the only rapper I listen to. Aside from Upchurch whom I like for his country rock song.
Nova's a video genius.
Dude it's 🔥!!
✌️😎👍
Tom's always a beast no surprise, shout out to Nova tho, Everytime I think that Nova has put out her best video something like this happens lol.. amazing song as always, but the videography on top of it.... 🔥 Hangover gang 4L
Just keeps getting better and better. 🔥🔥🔥
#HOGarmy  "Put you six feet deep. That's an underground rapper". That's tuuuuufff!
Awesome dude 🔥💀
🔥🔥🔥
"Put you six feet deep that's a underground rapper" 🤣🤣🤣
I look forward to Fridays with Tom. You're killin it again my friend🔥🔥🙏 Hangover gang 4 life!!👊❤️
👍
Rap/Rock is something that rarely works and produces a great song. This is one such time.
Yooooooo this is so damn good brother!!
Need a rock album Tom love the crickets lol. Much love and respect from Milwaukee
Every chorus is the same where he's crying it's sad he can't be original anymore smh
Love it bro.. always do.!! U rocked it this time.. congrats on great video too.!
Not a fan of this one, and that's ok. Not everything is for everyone! But this video, Nova KILLED it!
OH SNAP THIS IS SAVAGE AND FLAME!!! 🔥 📛 😎🤘 THERE IS SO MANY WAYS TO INTERPRET THIS IS INSANE!!!💀☠️😈 ITS TRUMPS FAULT AS INE EXAMPLE JS  KEEP IT GOING TOM!!! 💯
Weary of the back and forth,  Hasty to judge, silence defines my worth,  X's and O's, rearrange the hurt,  Be damned if that's all I pass down.  Don't clown. You looking upon the Eraser of frowns,   Creater of these sounds,  Always wants more rounds,
Straight flame!🔥🔥🔥🤯 Love this guy right here! One of the greats. Everytime I dont know what to expect, then everytime I'm surprised.
Y’all did it again brother I LOVE IT
Bro, why you got to be so mean, lol I'm over hear thinking about all of the reactor rappers who promote your music and how they are going to take this...shiiiiiiitttt!
Dude it's 🔥
The crickets bro lmao
Chug and slide? Hell yeah!
Plant...
One word..  FIRE
Been waiting for you switch it up a little and you didn't disappoint. Loving that little guitar in the background, try and use a drop D tuning next time you have a song with this style. It'll give it a bit more or growl to the guitar.
“Even if I never make a dollar again, I’m blessed” EXACTLY!!!! This is 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Good News! This was FIRST on my recommended✊.
Banger
Hey tom you should go to Tim Pool's podcast.. he has been shouting you out. I'm sure you have heard of him
🙌🏻🔥💯
Nice! Love it!! Sweeeeet!! Another hit :)))
Stunning.  🌼
let's get this at #1
This is the first time I ever bought a download of a song.
An hour ago? Let’s go baby!
Bad azz video and song, bruh!!! Still the sickest rapper out here! Unstoppable, undeniable,  independent,  lyrical genius! I love all of your music! Keep speaking the truth! 1mil🔥Hangover gang 4life
How many in that pile of bones voted Dem?
"Why so quiet? " 👂😁 This is why we love you Tom!! 🙏🤘🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bellissima come sempre
Bother that video is bad ass, Did Nova do all that, crushing it as always
My man, you've done it again. Badass song brother. Keep em coming!!! I wish everyday was a "Tom released a new song" day.
This isn't my flavor of music but you and your message to the people is too important for me not to support.  If views and likes help you at all, count me in.
god dam Friday really if your fucking day  with this banger!
worth the wait <3
Fire 😀 the rock background boos dude 💙
Bro....this shit is straight slappin. Nothing about politics or stupid people or wokeness....just straight bars. Leave it to T-Mac to notch up without a label. #Riot
Fuck ya! Another 1 !!!!!!
LET THE SALT FLOW BABY!
Tom and Team, Thank you for all you do ..can't express my appreciation enough..
And the hardest working man (& woman) in showbusiness is back...
As always love the editing, the lyrics are great but I think your flow could be improved on this one.
Another great one...
This is the first song of Toms in months that I didn't get a notification when a new song droped.... wonder why?🤔🤷
Chef’s kiss 😚❤️
President Trump's return theme song 🎵
This is another hit
🔥
this would've been perfect if you didn't do that thing you so often do: pause between the verse and chorus. that's literally the only issue I have. and speaking of the chorus... for once, it's not garbage 😀 it's a meme at this point that you struggle with hooks, but this one is proper  good job man  EDIT: after having this song on repeat for like 30mins, I think I now wanna buy it😅 really appreciate that is something from you that's NOT overtly political or commentary on social stuff. that can get exhausting to listen to when you release tracks like that back to back to back. if that makes sense
Amazing as usual pump this man up everyone BUY this single don’t just stream it…
Tom, you've outdone yourself with this one. And the visuals are astounding. The whole thing is awesome.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥another banger, Tom just keeps knocking them out
Damn Tom!!!!! Those guitar riffs🤘
Dude, I love it.  Banger!!!
The only complaint I could possibly muster up is that it's not long enough...😁 Another 🔥 track and another bad ass video by Nova!
Was in a motorcycle accident in May I'm just now starting physical therapy...this song is going to be my comeback song Thanks Tom you're the man  P.S.- can you make an extended version maybe with nova 🤷‍♂️
Banger! Production is excellent!
meh, not a fan of this but as always I am suuuuper happy for you Tom. We can't like everything you put out. Im just glad that even though I may not like it, someone else will and vice versa. That is what I love about you. So versatile.
Shout out to Quiet Riot!
dope!! Love the song but Holy Shit!! Nova's best work, ya'll killed it. Keep doin what you're doin.
Great job song sounds great keep up the good work
The number one in my heart no matter what 100% the realist
The video was great the song I didn't like sorry Tom your my favorite but this is the only one of your songs I dnt like plus not long enough and the course repeated to much.....
Dude! Your talent far exceeds your ego. That is saying a fucking ton! Thank you Tom
I had no idea this had even dropped. Not showing up in my sub feed. Only know because of Timcast's video.  Good work though, Tom! Keep it up!
Tom i feel like you are slacking. NOT!
SUPER FUCKIN TALENTED NO DOUBT💯 But, What's the deal with sporting the UPSIDE-DOWN CROSS🤔 Just really DON'T DIG THAT. FACT💯🇺🇸🕊🤍✝️🤍🕊🇺🇸💯
Love Tom. Love the video, love the beat, love the guitar, just not feeling the lyrics.
glad you finished this and are able to move on to the next one! one of your few that didn't ring so true for me. i hope you'll do a Samson collab in the future
Yuuuuuuuh get it main!
Wow! The effects on this are a-mazing!
Hey man, Tim Pool is pushing your new song hard on his channel. Cool song, man!
FuQ Eye know this is gonna be the most epic yet! 🔥🔥🔥 H.o.g
TOM! PEOPLE  REPLYING TO COMMENTS WITH THEIR OWN VIDEOS USING U FOR CLICKS
Putting this on repeat.... bouncing around the room with my middle fingers up! Thanks Tom and Nova for another banger. 💕🔥🤟👊 HOG for life.
Don’t stop bro!!! You are a legend
Definitely top hog shit right there!! Luv it!!!!
just bought it off Amazon.
Great job as always Tom
Meh
Holy shit....you did it again. 🤘🤘
another great song thx Tom, Nova that video was WOW.
I looove the heavy guitar. It just brings everything else together and makes it all... 🤌..."mwuah" Just asking, but id love to hear more of that metal influence with your music lol (Granted I haven't listened to every track of yours though)
Short one,but a good one.
This is legendary Tom
This was dumb. Sorry boss. Glad you got away from the politics for a bit but the hook was too much. Not enough bars. And every bar basically repeated that you were independent and better than everyone else. Why was the hook repeated over and over like that? Your actual bars were like 5 seconds each just to go back to the hook. This wasn’t it. Sorry.
Literally the best fucking song ever, Tom. Sorry… no clean way of saying how sick this song hits.
Hell yeah friggen amazing! Nova... Babe... SICK WAS JOB ON THE VID!❤ love you both! HOG4Life ❤❤❤❤
Dang, this is lit.
Greatest independent production group Tom, Nova, and the team keep great videos and music coming our way!! Love you guys
Please get yourself on Timcast dude. Your music is sick an you could really do some good work together.
can't thumbs up twice? then thumbs this up! waffles 🧇
Your best yet.
Da bomb son!!!
Love it bro!!! HOG4EVER!!!!
This is definitely the best Nova has done on all of your videos. Her work is absolutely amazing and this just shows even more how talented she is. Love the lyrics as well of course, you don’t miss wherever you aim.
It's a good tune but not my favourite Tom song
The head turn is definitely your thing! Love it!
Nailing it
A king is always a king Tom macdonald is a blessing to humanity ❤️
Love the vibe, the music, shoot love it all. You and Nova are so TALENTED! 👏🏻 👏🏻👏🏻
New song on repeat
Damn - ❤️❤️❤️❤️ That smirk after “why so quiet?” 😂😂🔥🔥🔥
Video and song is straight 🔥 🔥 🔥
Tom and Nova up their game with every song and video 🔥
Keep on rocking you legend.
really not a big fanof face tatts (but u do u), yet his songs cut deep into relevant topics right now around the globe. keep up that attitude and work mate!
Once again he is going to break YouTube with his music. Him and Nova are on a completely different level with them being independent.
👎
Broke a streak of some misses for me. Boy am I glad I can answer with your name again when people ask what's playing.
Tom McDonal Upchurch Acal demun jones and struggle on a track all together would be great
I refuse to get itunes. How else can I buy the single?
Pretty Sick Man, I Like It
Hey Mac it's Swiss b on my new profile, still lovin what u doin bad azz mfr, as always much love yall
I love damn near every song this man drops. On a side note that jacket suits his aesthetic so well!
A song about not caring what people think, that is censored lol...
Oooh. Those guitars!
Damn bro. That was some killer effects.
Dope visual kudos to Nova Vid Was Straight Ballz luv it 🔥
I get it you are awesome, like I enjoy most of your videos. I love the effects and stuff but didn't really care for the "message" or the words of this video. Who are you trying to dog on? It is nice that you are making your own music and videos (well, you and your girl) but it's okay to be humble at times. You can know that you're badass and still be likable if you truly don't give a shit about the haters. Good luck keeping up your image and keeping the followers that listen to your songs for the realness. I can't wait to see what you come up with next.
cringe
ABSOLUTE FIRE!!
Great Song!
You cannot make a bad song dude!! Like holy shit 😎
Damn dude. It's a banger alright. As always.
The graphics on this joint is pure fire! Congrats on another hit!
Views up by 3 K by the time I refreshed! LETS GOOOO!!!!! HOG 4 LIFE!
You got hits dude but I'm gonna be bumping this for ages! Love the rock feel and look bro it suits you. I loved everything about it well don't team HOG you always kill it!
Strength in numbers!
I relate this to Trumps followers and Bidens empty rallies…
This hits hard. The cricket effect makes it 🤌🏼 And the video. Damn, Nova!!! And who’s Jared Potter. Come on guys. Fill a girl in. He was credited in the last one, too. Nova is going to have people begging her to do their videos and art work 🖕🏼 😂
Those guitar rifts doing it for me.
BONENADO 10/10
Damn, you already have 38k views in 40 minutes. People are already posting reaction videos as of 9 minutes ago.   Nova and you have created this massive independent fire storm to be reckoned with. 🔥
Love ya
Thank you Tom and the hang over gang.  Another winner.  Keep up the great work.  I've got 5 of your albums and it looks like I'll be adding to my collection.
Much love Tom keep it up
Your music will never cease to amaze me. I can't thank you enough for all your hard work.
Just some feed back man, I think the crickets should have just been used to end on.... in the middle of the song it feels like it keeps interrupting it - maybe drop a remix version?  Anyway, can't wait until the next one. :)
Eyy finally a good one after all the pandering to american republicans. :D
Holy shit nova made this video crazy
Yo Tom… all I have to say is: “DAMN SON!” Cheers fro SoCal: 858!!
Man Tom, you got me so hyped for this, but the lyrics didn't impress me. Everything else, so sick! Keep it up, you're amazing !
ahem mostly peaceful but fiery protest.
damn... those visuals in this video, amazing.
I bet you Trump will be bumping this song to Biden every day from now on. Wouldn't it be great if he @Biden this song 🤣😂
Number 14 in all genres and number 3 in hip hop/ rap on iTunes. An hour after the drop!!  Loving this song! Love the metal twist to it. I forgot to add how much I LOVE this video!! Y’all killed it!!
Sick! 🔥
Banger!!!
BOOM
Man this didn't drop till noon for me I finally saw it, Nova is Goated at these music videos keep doing your thing Tom

Nice touch with the crickets. 👏
YES!!! 100%, you should ABSOLUTELY make more like this!!
Didn't know you had a new song till Tim Pool said it a hr ago. Came to give props, long time follower.
Why is this so short 🥹 🔥
Song is fire 🔥 video is fire 🔥 big love to Tom, Nova, and my man Evan 🤙
Someone got a green screen. 😛
It's so funny to me that toms a awesome conservative leaning rapper with excellent messaging but looks like a woke antifa leader lmao
Absolutely 🔥 ! Keep it up Tom
The guitar strumming reminds me of leveling up in Black ops 2
shiiiiiiiiittttt! That was dope
Amazing
A little different than usual Tom but still amazing and videos production is amazing
Such amazing song and Nova just doesn't stop with the creativity 😍
🤘🏻
the first time I saw Tom his video came on right after I watched a video about Black Eyed Children - and the next video that came on was Tom with Black contacts in - i was like DAFUQ is going on here... and I talked ish like WHY do you look like black eyed children?!!  ..  and then i went to another song and then another song and another song and I have not ever left !   But, I do feel bad about talking ish for a second because i FLIPPING LOVE Tom and Nova.   ha !
🔥🔥🔥
Can we talk about how high quality the video is?? Yall did an amazing job!
Ik ben een groot fan van jullie  maar alles klink zo t zelfde , wel een super gaaf nummer weer. Je werk van  even geleden was sterker en up to date met wat er aan de hand is in de wereld  graag meer van dat!     🇳🇱👍🏻
Definitely goes hard dude 🔥
Oooooooeeee straight 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Good job my fellow canadian! From Quebec with LOVE.
Just like Adam’s new song this was fire
😎💕🎶 excellent visual effects, great song. 🎸
🏆🔥🙌🙏⚔️🏆
🔥🎤🎸🔥
I'm just here to feed the algorithm 🤘🤘
To be honest I don't care for this one but the Video is Top notch , Nova making her man look fierce.   Side note* I don't think Tom can outdo himself, he has so many masterpieces.  I can't imagine the tedious time it takes to put this all together.  #HOG #Forever&ADay
Ugh its always hit and miss with you tom. I love your music but one min you do a good song then you produce trash like this.
❤
YouTubes already suppressing the hell out of this song
Go on tour please
I love it I love the CGI the lyrics keep up the good work 😁
I normally like your music. Can't say that this time sadly
Banging brother!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
this was different. i need to see the lyrics because i couldn't quite catch it all. im not sure what all is being conveyed here.
That's what's up
Goat#
This is hot!!! Love the effects!
...................................
This is 🔥🔥🔥 HOG!!!
Freaking love it man. You never fail to bring it. I'd "riot" your way any day! 🔥 🔥
Brother y'all never fall short of amazing. I've told this before I'm a fan for life. Love it as much as I love your other. Keep it going brother. Give Nova a big hug also.

Nova you did a phenomenal job on this video epic
Never Quit Tom!!! HOG4L!
Fantastic music. Everything perfectly made! 💯
Another great one! ❤
Dope Vid.
Dig it. Love the video. Wish it was a little longer, why because I liked it that much. Best wishes, great job tom, nova and the rest of the crew stay independent my friend you got this.
Never Quit Tom!!! HOG4L!
Good production on the video, shit macho bullshit lyrics!!! Enough cock hanging out already. I loved "Don't look Down" "NO RESPONSE" but enough already. Ya ya ya. Fuck I'm disappointed sitting up here in Canada. Put you dick back in your pants Thomas!!! We know already!!! Respect mind you!!! Nova owns this one %100 as usual!!!
Dude, this music needs to be in a game. Freaking awesome!
Wow Great job Tom !!!!
Great!!! Love it!!! You and your crew have come such a long way, your sounds are maturing and her editing has climbed to the next level! I love how professional this has become! Tom, NEVER stop my brother!
I swear tom and nova are next level!!!   I will never stop listening to their masterpieces ❤❤❤
Wow I never really noticed before of how many people are so lame that they have to put links to there own music or what not in the  comments of Tom's videos. Guess that's what he means when he says they use him for click bait.
I frickin love this guy.   Every song is so unique and original.   I think the 2 Toms is so original too.   2 different looks for 2 different sides of Tom.   So cool.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Fantastic production!!!
Another amazing production from HOG! Keep the great stuff coming bro!
Always fire azz music Tom💯🔥🎶 Keep pushin sir 💪🏼💪🏼
Shout out to all the people who were Tom MacDonald fans before it was cool.
Mainstream rappers have no originality and sound like everyone else. They have NOTHING ON TOM MACDONALD 💯🔥❤️
Wow, that video production though……… 🔥
#hog
never disappointed
Another hit, I wouldn't expect anything less from you.
😯😯😯😯😯💥there you go.  Great job.  👍
Hell yeah Tom another hit💯💯 I believe you when you say you will always stay independent, show them how it’s done!!🔥💥🔥💥hey Nova💚

The video was awesome!!!  But... the song missed the mark. It just felt held back, like you were trying to go metal but wanted to stay in the shallow end of the pool. Lol.  I still think you are awesome through!

A thousand views a minute keep it bro love the video much love B.G

Love the Guitar - Great video!!
I like the video. I'll have to watch it on the TV when I get home from work to see it fully.
Stronger than bathtub gin, I tell ya what. Another banger from the G O A T
Great song!! “I’m still the biggest sit the fuck down” You da man!!!
It’s amazing to see how far your lyrics, tone, ability to rap…all of it…how far it come since your days of nearly all auto tuned songs. You’re a beast and you keep getting better.
Awesome!!
Digging the heavy metal vibe! You guy's hit this one out of the park⚾
Was nice good job
Tom you should diss Eminem
Those crickets @0:49 ☠️ 🔥
Nova outdid herself with this video....🔥🔥 #HOG
That was dope as fuck. Wish it was 10 mins long. Great video work.

Workout Playlist add! Bro, keep spitting 🔥
This is legit fire. I enjoy all of your music. It’s easy to vibe with and feel the emotions put into every word of each song. Keep moving forward and keep being the greatest you! Your music has definitely helped me through hard times. Thank you for existing, I appreciate you!
It’s a little generic but you got the visuals to kinda compensate for it. Snowflakes was your peek in my opinion but overall I like it.
Love the guitar, keep bringing the rock!
Brother keep doing what you're doing keep the pressure on the truth
I love your music so much all of you guys are so real and Nova to love love it all
Tom's old style
Nice to hear an electric guitar in some rap
Yeah boy 💙
Holy shit! Just when you think he can’t get better he just throws flames! Love the hook and that beat!! And wow Nova! 1 million flame emojis!
Thank you Tom for not being a sell out in a world where so many are bought, sold, and paid for.  You aren't a puppet in a world where so many others sing and dance to hypnotize the masses, while their demonic elitist puppet masters pull the strings and puppeteer their every move.  You aren't a slave to the system and we the people who value freedom and truth above all else see and hear YOU!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🤘🏻😎🤘🏻🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is dope man!!! Amazing song and video!!! Everything is so amazingly put together!! Much love and praise!!
Man Tom for the 1st time in I can't remember how long It's ok not feeling as much not saying it's not good it is but nothing like what I was expecting it's short and not much details like your other fire ass jams I still love you Bro many of your songs has helped in get passed some dark times and feel from my sole keep it coming 1LOVE BRO

And then Nova!  wow, killed this video... everything you do, both of you.  Sound like a broken record been saying it all for damn near 3 years.  Much love bruh.  Fuck the music industry talking shit about you being bad rapper.  Hope you saw my post on that video.  Keep calling 'em out Tom .  Hangover Gang 4 LYF !!!

You have a genuine following Tom, your music is unique, truthful and above all else avoiding the lamestream sound that so many of us are sick of. Keep up the awesome work you two, your collabs are beyond compare. You never cease to amaze your fans with one after another  eardrum nutrition!! Love it!!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Your favorite rapper ain't doing it like mine 🐐

Freaking awesome best one in a long time love the metal tone to it killed it. 👍👍
0:23 upside down cross on the hog mask? Tom i love you and your music but that caught me by surprise
BANGER!
love your stuff but this one..ehhh
Wow, this one won me back.  The bars, production, videography, hook... 💯 KILLED it.
This dude reminds me of eminem in ways. He speaks the truth even if it’s dangerous to. Great music
Fucking Nova is killin it with these videos yo, you guys are so far from reaching your peak, and there ain't no plateau anywhere even close. I've been listening to your shit for years homie, and I've found other artists that I fucking loved in that time, but as I find myself listening to them less and less as the time goes by, I still find myself just as fucking stoked for your new shit as I was listening to white boy, dear rappers, helluvit, and all those fucking bangers that still hold up just as strong today. Fucking fire, yo, MMFWCL homie, whoop whoop
Sorry Tom, I didn't care for this one too much. The beat is kind of annoying.. that tick tick tick is obnoxious.. but the special effects were next level.   Keep it up boss
Woooooooo weeeee!!!! You were right Tom! The visuals are absolute 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Gonna be rockin this bitch for a few days!!! #HOG4Life #HangOverGang #HOG
love the guitar 🎸 in this song!!! feel free to sprinkle that in again in the future!!! AWESOME SONG.
Amen
Is there ANYTHING that you and Nova CAN'T do together?!? Absolutely stunning, kids!! Y'all never fail to amaze me, or make my old bones want to get up out of the damn chair and move!! 💃💃😂😂
The crickets killed me 🤣😂🤣🔥🔥🔥
oooooo fire
lovin the hair
Love it tom👍👍
I can't believe he is on the list for worst rapper that is crazy he is no where close to being a bad rapper
havent herd it yet this gonna fire
Wow, this great. I’d say I’m surprised; however, everything Tom creates is top notch. Keep doing your thing!
I love everything you do. You brought it hard! But you wanna bring it harder? Listen to more 90s NYC hardcore. I'd say throw the auto tuning away. But you do you cause its working. Just throwing food for thought at ya. Keep slaying it!!!!
I heard the tune like 09.10 MST, but no vid. Also disabled comments.Was someone allowed an early drop on the audio?? Fine if it is, just seems pretty sus compared to how HOG usually releases 🤷‍♂️
Anyone else disappointed 😞  This wasn't a Call to action. For everyone to Step up and do something. Damn when is someone going to lead us out of out this mess. When I saw the post 'riot' I really prayed.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bro that "why so quiet" instrumental break is SO FUCKING DOPE. Literally gave me chills dude. This one hard af.
Wow! I don't even know what to say anymore man, you're just amazing! And Nova, she's insane! Every video is perfection! BTW...where did you get that jacket?!?!? 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
Way too fire 🔥
Great track like always, but FUCK youtube
I like the song but had to dislike because he swore to God. The Bible tells us to swear upon nothing
Another game changer...
Completely new... hmm... keep it up tom!
Cypress Hill riot
❤️‍🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🇺🇸😎
I am imagining 100s of Trump/Biden  videos using this.
Nova is out here making Terminator movies!! And Tom COMMANDS the screen. 10/10!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥 🔥
@TomMacDonald  thanks for doing another bang up song. Nova you're an awesome person as well.
Awesome video bud. Killin it!
Sick video effects!! I love it
Can you believe they put this guy on 50 worst rappers of all time
Badass!
Eres increíble Tom, me has dejado sin palabras, la producción de la pista es maravillosa, suena a música #NEFFEX, y el filme del video, épico, siempre tan sensacional hombre.
This is the hero we wanted...not the one we deserve.
Tom, What’s with the upside down cross on the ski mask?
Pure 🔥🔥🔥 always stay independent Tom macdonald you and Nova work awesome together
I love how Tom and Nova keep getting better. Usually artists become so commercial after their first maybe second album. Because they are independent we will always get what we are expecting or more. Keep going guys you have and army behind you 💜 💪
Love it! Let’s start a Riot!
Dam hell ya perfect hard hitting truth
Coming out Tommy Gunnz 'a 'Blazin! Noice! Love the fusion style cuisine and am definitely hungry for more! Did you splash some MSG on that shit or what!? Love from Niagara Canada Brother!  Lets get folks chirping and rubbing their legs together like them Crickets!
Evolution is a beautiful thing to watch, keep growing, love the track. The only problem I ever seem to have with your tracks is when they stop!
It's a dope video but I still think the I hate hip-hop video was the best one visually
man you left blood on the mic 🤯
Nah man its different but I can vibe ez
🤘🤟
👍👍👍 Excellent
Hell yeah son. That's a great beat. Love love your music. Keep going  brother. Right on..........
Dam rhis was very heavy-duty  great work on this one to you tom and the hangovergang

The crickets tho 😤😤
Hell yeah!! This beat is fire!!
H.O.G for life! 🙌🏼🔥
Damn bruh love this shit dawg!  😎
Pretty basic tbh. Doesn’t stand up to your other release’s. Cool special effects, but that’s about it.
👍🖖
Fire! I dig the metal hooks and the visuals are on point! 👊🏼
I said it a bunch of times and I’ll continue to say it… Tom MacDonald is a genius 💣💣💣
you never disappoint 💙 fantastic video
"Look at me, look at me!" Why don't you talk about something important? You're no Samson.
Jared killed these VFX!
Ok ..this shit is hard as fuck 💯🤘
🔥 🔥 as usual 😊
Powerful song Tom! Always speaking the facts!
YES!!
Death threats to Gravestones to now standing on top of a Mountain of Skeleton's. You sir are a legend. Tom McDonald operating Independent killing the competition who can even match him...
GOAT
Is that a upside down cross on the mask?  We all know what an upside cross means.
Great song, very relaxing. The guitar chords remind me a lot of Hypocrisy's "Apocalypse", one of my old favorites.
Beat on point!
Fantastic!!!
Hot take: thank you for not making another political song. Just fighting the woke lib-tards it's important but I'm dying for some old Tom to come back
If the Vikings carry entertainers with them on their raids it would've been someone like Tom.
🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌fricking amazing 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Amazing  !!
This show why Tom and nova are the goat

Just when I think I couldn’t be any more impressed with Tom and Novas talent, they go and do it again! You’ve outdone yourselves again. 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 Absolute banger and 🔥🔥🔥 visuals. ✌🏼🤟🏼🤘🏼
The drop of the beat after he says 'quiet' is KILLER. 🔥
👍🙂
In hell the dead will be forgotten...
Loveeeeeeeee it!!!

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wavy kids gonna love to play this
This is fuc$ing awesome!!!
He's right.  The moment he announces a Friday drop we get excited 😎
Visuals are beyond 🔥 amazing! The song goes hard too. Tom and Nova did it again. ❤ #hog
Hey Tom, When ya gonna do more Political videos???? I Love them!!! Always speaking the truth and facts!!!
Yall done it again...NOVA on her game...and Tom well ur bomb...
While Tom has become known for more political lyrics and messages. This is just a cool track and quite frankly sonically his best work. The vocal tones and more lush chorus really shine on this one. Its the kinda of work you can tell he slaves over to consistently make subtle changes to improve. Change the world Tom!
Absolutely amazing, once again!
Appreciate that chunky riff bro. DIGGGGG IT !
Listened at 9….  Now watching. NOT disappointed.
Get it my dudes !!! 😁🤙💯🖤🤘😊 #HOG4L Another fucking rager!!  Tom and Nova... let's go!!  Much love from Montana  -Meg 🌹
Was worth to wait for this 🙏🏻🔥🤘🏻
Nova!  Excellent job producing this banger video!  Mac, keep em coming! ✌😎🏴‍☠️
Bruh.. Never stop being you.. I've yet to hear a song that isn't a banger and all you're doing is being real as fuck.  Props to Nova, y'all are constantly hitting those level ups in your craft 💕
What are her ties to the family name? And would she ever publicly oppose the  rockefeller family agenda?  I have faith you're makin a profit through true feelings and genuine lyrics and not off the social divide.
Can't wait for the "Fuck Canada" song to come out.
Love it bro....220 days no alcohol. Hangover gang for life
Great energy and visuals with this one. Come on HOG ,"why so quiet"{cricket sounds}. Lets pound this one guys. These one is going to be easy to listen on repeat. HOG4LIFE
Hell yea bro, It, was different, It didn't grab me like some of your other songs, but I aint got no complaints,  keep doing it bro.

Video was Amazing. Song was fire. Tom and Nova never disappoint. Mount Rushmore of independent rappers. Tom, you are on the Mount Rushmore of rappers. Fuck the independent.  Don't let anyone tell you less. Hangover Gang family got your back. HOG 4LIFE!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This was crazy amazing. You outdid  yourself with this one. Amazing. This one is going to blow-up soon. Let's hit that #1 trending.
There is nothing Tom can't conquer. So versatile with his music! The message is always honest and raw.
I do respect that both you and Tim Poole are independent artist topping the charts
Auto-tune garbage
Nova is a magician
Raw
The stitching on his ski mask is genius 💪💪
Another kickass song, Tom MacDonald you rock ❣️
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
As per usual, Tom coming out with more fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Not my favorite song, but the video is really good. Good luck.
You continue to Rock it every time Thank you ❣️@Nova
Do a song about human trafficking. The world needs a shake up.
Did this looks so fking Profesh
Link to a short primoting the song https://youtube.com/shorts/57DVmRLma8M?feature=share
The only bad thing to say about this song; Is that it's only 2:38 long.
🔥
Damn bro this could have gone on for 4 min, too short i want moreeeeee
Not to project but this is awesome because it reminds me my favorite music right now, #TransAlienWitchTribe. It's empowering and cleansing. The atmospheres bring cleansing, and the riffs bring empowerment.
Fire!!🤷
Love your music, and your style and the message, would be interesting to hear a rap/metal rip. Or a rap/country just a an idea... You could reach more people if you change it up a bit. I've got family I know would live your music if it wasn't exactly rap.... Great work on this one.
DAMN!!!! I LOVE IT!!  Omg dude!! This song is amazing! This video is outstanding!! You blow my mind everytime you release a new song/video and I've been with ya since waaay before Friday was Tom Macdonald Day, lol!! Seriously man, I'm so proud of you and Nova! Y'all slay no matter what y'all do! Incredible job you guys!! I love you guys so big!!! #Hangovergangforever #TomMacdonaldforever
Best, most intense video yet Tom and Nova!!  Love the effects! And I love the intro of a bit of hardcore rap/metal with the guitar! Keep doin what u do and thinking outside of the box!! 🤯☺️💥
FUCKING 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Here we go fellas!!!!
😲 wow Tom that was crazy.
Lyrically is terrible.
Check out My boy Tyson James for some real music. 💯

New top 5 bro
Unreal engine 5?
The artwork with the lightning coming from your hands is sick bro your awesome dude lifelong fan I was rocking with you over 5 years ago but I'm a metal guy and you put that distorted guitar omg that's dope I'm a drummer and I pick apart a song your incredible Tom macdonald,!!! Nothing but love for you and the hangover gang
20 years later. We will still be reminded that you're independent.
Fucking A-right!
this song is 🔥. tom macdonald never ceases to amazing me dropping lit music. no one can stop him. a lyrical genius. im glad you didnt sell out to the corporations and agendists. the left hates free speech, they hate the truth, theyd rather everyone suffering. the right side wants a world thats better for everyone living in it. TOM doesn't stop releasing dope music and the videos are on point!
Great job. Treat from you and Adam today.  👏
🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 X ♾
I'm ready for a Tom MacDonald concert...
It’s about damn time you got heavy! F yeah y’all
Total FIRE!🔥🔥🔥🔥❤‍🔥
The crickets... silence is louder than a bomb.⚡👊🏼⚡
🔥 💪 🔥
Finally back with a new one!
Day 1 this breaks a MILLION CALLING IT NOW
❤️‍🔥
Damn, I kinda hoped this was gonna be more about getting people pissed off about how establishment is literally crushing the masses and ruining the world and we've allowed it for too long.
Okay, im  a video editor by pure PASSION. its my biggest hobby ever. i taught myself on a smart phone upgraded to fancy tech on a computer. ive always payed great detail to not only my work but others as well. Tom and Nova have made some unbelivable feats using at home technology and it never ceases to amaze me but this video? it looks like a preduction team made it wich is incredible!!!!
Tom's back? Nah...nah...he never left, you just fell asleep. Time to wake up.
Bought not one, but 2 copies of The Brave. Fan.  However, do NOT "throw middle finger up in the air (at God)." If asked to do so at concert, exit!  10 died at Jenner girl boyfriend's concert. Look into it. Was a ritual. He had them do same thing..."give the middle finger to the sky!"   Man, I'm gonna be SERIOUSLY bummed if turns out our guy Tom, man of the people, controlled opposition, too.   Throw the middle finger up in the air?  Naw man, this world is messed up enough by all of us throwing around the middle finger attitude.
God damn bro you just can't do wrong that shit was banging
I was not expecting this from u . So bad
🔥🔥🔥
Tom!!! Video is a riot!!!!
Another bad ass track and video by the man. As an independent artist I'd love to have a chance to work with this man. Very intelligent and actually real with it... much love
CGI was great. Song itself is ok
Here for it!
Great song and video!!!!
🔥🔥🔥 ANOTHER BANGER!
This guys videos are 1000% PRO and his independent WTF?
Tom Mac and A Cal drop the same day. Thank God for Fridays
Straight fire brother 🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️‍🔥
Holy f****** hell tom macdonald that's straight and to the point much love broskie
You read my mind Tom! I was just thinking earlier today, “It would be cool to hear something new from Tom McDonald”. Maybe something fresh…I like how you use the word riot to make something upbeat and chill! Keep ‘em coming. I’m glad I found your music on YouTube. You do not disappoint! 👊
you know what helps against Popping Veins ... That's Right Red Beets and Betalain, Naturally Edible Digestible and Absorbable Via Skin,  NomzWarfare Still Beeting ClimateChange... aaaand Bio/ChemicalWarfare.  Blessing's too You and Nova ... WehMaBetalainPowda@   ima Smack yo Resident for Quoting me ... he no Beet BigPharma, Natural Nomz Did Grrrrr🐉

My favorite is still "my fans" and "people so stupid".    As always, strong work.
Love that he  can produce what he wants and isn't beholden to a record label.
Some good hype music!! I love it!
LOVE IT ♥️♥️♥️♥️🔥🔥🔥🔥
Fuck yes Tom. This is Tom's artistry. Fuck yes. I been fucking waiting. Tom's finally evolved. 🙌 this is fucking hard.
I like the style of this one, but it just didn't hit with me. Had to be one eventually,  can't remember the last one I didn't like.
Act in a video with me!! Check me out let’s Collab

Great job Tom.  The video is amazing.   Love the song too.  After listening to it a few time, the Beat and the guitars are so nasty.  Love it.
#HOGlove 💕
that is hard ... I like it... 😀
bruh why you censoring them
Conan the barbarian 🔥🇬🇧
I will not go mainstream, dawg you know I hate pop I'll be screamin' "fuck the industry" until my veins pop 🙌🏻🥵💯
Y'all out did yourself this time you are so awesome thank you for your music and Nova thank you for your talent we are so blessed to have y'all awesome thank you

He did it again!!!
I love you Tom!💜
This is why the wait is worth it Tom. Your videos are  extraordinary. The amount of care and craftsmanship you and Nova do is unbelievable. Keep up the amazing work.
🥱
You and Nova are an amazing super couple! Out there killin it, as always!
The video is amazing but the song it self for me isn't all that but keep up the work tom
🔥 I was suffering political fatigue. This came at a good time. Good job Nova and Jared
Feels a bit off somehow the tempo of the song is mumble rappy with few lines and then goes on repeat, I was expecting Tom to pop off but he never did, I am not hating i am just being 100% honest. Not my type of song honestly. Keep at it.
Niiiiice!!! Love the dark vibe man.
I thought your music was good before, but this one dayyyyyyyyyyum 🔥🔥🤘🏻🤘🏻
I love the songs with heavy guitar riffs. 💪🏼
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯🤘
Love the guitar work in this
Love the crickets!!!!

wait why is the word "fuck" censored?
It was nice, it wasn’t your best work, but it was nice. Good job.  Just keep going. I am excited to see what you make next.
Awesome job as always
Awesome
CHILS CHILS CHILLS!!!!  OMG, I know what's going to be playing on blast in my car for the next week. You out did yourself again Tom and Nova, just STRAIGHT FIRE!! that BEAT IS SICK!  LOVE when you mix in rock.  AWESOME!  💗💗💗🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🎸🎶🎶🎶🎵🎵🎵🎵🎼🎼🎼🎼🎼🎼🎙#HOG #Hangovergang for life
holy fuck this goes hard!!! tom is love tom is life! <3
☠💀☠
Love it, sounds amazing. Love love the rock/metal+rap vibes.
Hell Yes!!! ❤️🤍💙
Love Tom. But not digging this 1. It's cool in all
There us some quality bits of this that scream Tom and Nova. But overall, this doesn't feel like yall man.  It's good.  Don't get me wrong.  I went and bought it for the support even.  But if I am being honest, this just doesn't feel like yall. It feels like you started listening a bit to what the haters say.  And THAT, is not Tom and Nova. We fell in love with yall because you are not the rest. Personally,  I view this just as an exercise in showing the other side you can do what they do,  and still slay it. If they can't see that,  they will never see it. I hope yall stay true to you after this.  Great job nonetheless! And nothing but love even if no sugar coat 💕
He did it again! Like always bringing that dope sh*t!
I love it - Greetings from Deutschland!💖
Love ya art. Been waiting for a new sound for little bit from ya. This was it.  Epic!
Bro, you going to tour soon? If you do please come to Minnesota!
Nice musical mix and as always great lyrics and cinématographique effect!
Took me a few plays to get into the vibe. Thumbs up! It’s different ride but worth it. Yay Tom!
I miss the premier but it never too late yo comment for the algo. Fu@$ the hatters.!
Awesome work #hangovergang
43 mins on YouTube and already 2k comments.... Absolutely amazing
Nova and Jared raising the bar with this one. Those VFX are truly cinematic quality. 10/10
Damn!! It’s amazing how amazing every piece of content is. Every song, every video, wow!!!!🤯🤯🤯🤯
*LETS GET THIS TRENDING!!*
Bro! Good to see you! Dope song.👍
Good stuff! Thank you for the bad ass videos! And music!
Always great
Damn you and Trump, I can see a parallel 🔥🔥🔥🔥 this could be a theme song at his rallies 😊
Wish this song was longer because of how dope it is! Hell yea Tom and nova!
Lets goooo
Hell ya!  It’s Friday it’s Tom’s Day!
Keep Killin it
40K+ views in just 45 minutes!!!  LETS BLOW THIS UP!!!!
Fuckin'A!
Fucking fire man missed your music
Less than an hour into the drop and only 40k views. Seems like YT is throttling numbers again.
💥🤯💥🤯💥🤯💥
❤ I'm floored by the bones and skulls...  The visual effects of this is Grade A quality cinematic television. Movie🤘 Movie🤘movie 🤘movie... 2 hour full length feature  with previously recorded unreleased music's flipped into some heavy metal songs. Timing is everything for a car... if it's not timed right, it might not even start. Your car is tuned... Your engine is running... Now what? Do you? Cruise it till the gas runs out? Or Do you floor it and race for the finish line? Either way', this is the only life you get to cement your legacy. Make sure there never comes a time when you look back and wonder if you came the right direction. ...  If you didn't take that first step, the journey wouldn't have began. And I know you don't regret the journey. It's not only brought you to where you are, it helped you become WHO you are. Be proud of that.. because it's enough to be proud of.
This is a banger 🔥 live the visual effects 👌.. #H.O.G
Love the new song and the special effects were a super nice touch! Very different style than I am used to seeing from Tom. While not the best of the ones that have been released lately (Scars was my personal fav cause it was just, wow!) still a  nice change of pace. The background music really set a tone for sure. While I would not mind seeing Tom release a Rap/Metal song, this is close and the overall feel is just as good. Keep up the good work Tom, you changing the world in your own way one song at a time!
Tom been making the same song for a year now. He's boring now tbh. It was always a big deal when he dropped but the hype just gone and these fans even lie like they still like it lol
Great song Tom🔥❤
🔥🔥🔥
Yas!!
Tom MacDonald started from the bottom, but now he is here, at the TOP 🙌🏻💴💴💴😎👍🏻
Tom again you and your gang are awesome 👏
We’re witnessing the downfall of Tom Macdonald.
A lot of wigger talk, MacDonald. Lead the charge or shut up and stop LARP'ing.
Super fvcking dope
This would have been the perfect track to feature Tech N9ne. Independent GOATs
Give me more of that from 1:07 to 1:23!
Shits a banger #letsgoooooooo
Nice!!! The video was dope, nice CGI! Heading to iTunes to buy, gotta have something to hold me over until the CD comes out.
meh,,, lyrics were not my favorite. but loved the guitar and anger.
Another awesome one song and video as well.Keep it up like this .Love ya from UK. ;)
Sounds just like names
Great job young man  And miss nova
The world gets stuck looking at lizzo's but yet they dont know the fire known as TOM McDONALD. It's such a damn shame🔥🔥
Sorry I’m late I didn’t have my phone at work so I came home on lunch to watch!! Tom this is insane! I got such a different feel from this song and the sound and the visuals…you weren’t kidding whatsoever about how absolutely amazing they are!! The way your mind works and yours and nova’s level of creativity is simply on another level like nobody is touching you, PERIOD!!! And your flow was so different and so refreshing and gave me chills all over!! This is going to top so many billboards I just know it!!! #Riot #HangoverGangForever🔥🏆⭐️🤘

Aye, it's Tomday! Imma start a riot.
Tom, I know you probably won't see this but just wanted to say that you are an inspiration for my own sobriety. After I got back from a terrible deployment in Afghanistan,  I struggled with PTSD and addiction issues. I have steadily changed my life for the better since, went to therapy, got completely clean and surround myself with like minded people/influences. Thank you and Nova for your insane work ethic and sticking with your morals. You are greatly appreciated brother.
That guitar really hits. Good shit tom!

Tom is a real artist and says what he means and means what he says. Always brings the fire in his lyrics and videos
That guitar at 1:10 though.  ☠️ fire
Always amazed by your versatility. Not to mention, Nova's incredible camera work. You two are truly something special
I fucking LOVE cocky Tom!! ❤ this song is fucking dope!  HOG4EVER
Tom, you F’ing rock, man! This was awesome, not just the music, which is always top notch, but the production of the video was just mind blowing. You have an incredible imagination, or vision if you would rather call it that, and you are always able to wake up the viewer’s emotions. I believe that your genius is way understated, and your message is often unheard by far too many people. You need to be wall to wall and wake up this nation, open their eyes. I will always do whatever I can to help make that happen. 🤘🤘🌹🌹🌹🌹👏👏👏👏
Tom and Nova never disappoint! Love you both keep making dope ass music for us ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Dude makes good music even if it's not for you while we have mumble rappers and yet he gets put on the worst rapper list?!?!? So confused 😐
bro your music is Fire bro 🔥 you and dax are the most positive rapper's I will listen to everyday
I would love to see you interviewed by Ray Comfort!! So good!
Nice 👍
Oh my sweet God What a great production Congratulations 🎉
🔥🔥🔥Love that guitar 🎸
Dude go political meltdown on these asshats in office. Just let them have it!
Gives me some real Kurt Cobain vibes with some of the visuals. Another fire video. Song is not that great, but not everyone can be a super banger.
I'm impressed by the production quality.  It's been a pleasure watching your work the last year.
That was Amazing and So True to todays Age how Ironic is that Riots everywhere
Amazing from start to finish 🔥🔥💪🏻
Now Tom and New Adam on the same day. It's a good day.
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️ mint!
Why is his music getting worse. It’s like he’s always pretending he’s the only independent rapper. I think you fell from the clouds and hit the ground with this one.  Lame song man.
Yooooo this is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 as all your music is ❤️ #HOG
We need a Tom, jelly roll tour
Awesome... That's about all I have to say
Muthrrfcking Bravo!  Banger exponential!  Mad props to Tom, Nova and Jared!  Badass!
Great addition Tom!
Tom you tops.  Singing about social issues is cool.  Self aggrandizing  is not cool.
I saw you posted a new song and I got hyped the **** up! Yes!
100%
Never disappointed always 🔥 spinning true facts
Absolutely love it!!!!!
Killer Track bud and round of applause to Nova for these cinematics!
where's the bass?
Please everyone hear the gospel message before it's too late or they try to cancel it! Ray Comfort has FREE movies and interviews on YouTube with the gospel! Jesus is our only hope for freedom and Salvation not politicians or abortion or changing your identity!!
Damn this shit goes hard
Visuals were killer nice job tom and nova thanks for making this masterpiece 🤟🤟🤟
That was so good I had to watch it twice
Another bangerrr 🔥🔥
Hey Tom just wanted you to know for once I was proud of the music that my kids were listening too! I just discovered you last week when my son was jamming out to you. At first I was like who the is this guy. First thing I heard was bad news. Yeah you’re a shocker when you see you for the first time. lol 😂 but I have listen to everything you’ve done in recent years in the last week. Download my favorites and bad news is definitely one of them. Please keep up the good work. I am ecstatic that you are doing well that means country has some people still left in it that have some common sense. Thank you for what you do. The Burnett family
It's poetry.........
Simply great
Good job guys
Tom MacDonald Your Music videos Truly is Has so Hard and Rocking with this songs This was Lit 🔥🔥🔥💜❤️💜💯💯💯

The guitar is a sick touch!!
This is crazy 💥 💥 💥 IM BLESSED 💯
It's a good song I like that you experiment

Love This ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😘😘😘😘😍
Hell yeah a new rap rock song I'm so hear for it LET'S GO HOG FOR LIFE.
Rest in peace ✌🏻 Pat stay
I have never not loved all your songs. Literally every single one. This is the first I’m not in love with good song tho
The song is fine, maybe a bit too much of the same old topic, but the video itself is amazing!  Love the coat and the facial expressions.  No one does this type of art better than MacDonald and Nova!
Mixn it up some! Keep killin it! Cheers from the Great White North!
Let’s fuckin go Tom!
Right now this is at 1k views per minute since it's been uploaded
Slaying it as always!
How on earth does Tom always seem to capture the essence of rock and roll (led zeppelin) in his rap? It’s truly unique.
well that was awesome!
I liked it, but I was expecting bars when you posted Demon Tom.
We. Are. Not. Worthy!
Yoooooo duuuuudeeee!! You are KILLING IT!!! <3 <3 <3 :D
Hell yessss that beat and bars are insane 🔥
Ahhhh man!!!! The music, the vocals, the video!!!!! 🤩💥😍⚡️🔥🌟  Excellent!!! Thank you Tom & Nova❤️‍🔥💖  I can’t stop listening to it, it’s so good.🔥
BRO!!! You and NOVA keep killing it with these visuals.
God d@mn, absolute fire. 🔥🔥🔥
🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Omg I love this song. Tom and Nova you never disappoint us. Thank you. Nova the graphics are of the chain.
Tom slaying it like always  and Novas vid work is off the charts. This power couple just keeps getting better 🤘 #HOG4EVER ✌️❤️
Man, this one's got such a sick sound to it that I can't stop repeating it
And yet another one. McDonald one of a kind.
Rock + Rnb this one is fire tom. Seriously good bro
So I'm not gonna lie. I heard this song this morning before the video dropped and I very much disliked it. Didn't even listen to it all. I thought ohh here's tom bragging again......but then the vid dropped.....and I realized.....ohhh here's tom bragging again.......cause he fucking can! This video is amazing and it mixed with song is truly baddass. After all you are the goat!
yea 100% feel like i just spent 3 min of my life i am never going to get back. Its like you are not even trying anymore. would rather watch poorly dubed cat memes. DO BETTER!
Another 1
Production was crazy. Hats off to Nova!
Stay true never kneel to the system 🔥
Oh yeaaaaaaah!
Hell yes this is my jam!!! I wasn't ready but damn I'm hyped and love the lyrics and Tom macdonald Killin it and much love and respect to a true artist f the industry
this is sick man 🔥🔥got some real meaning behind them lryics much love
Kinda mediocre song.
beats are getting to repetetive
I can't say it's my fav. But I can say I appreciate you branching out and not staying the same. Not every song can nor should be an anthem. My favorite hooks from you aren't layered as much n have nova in them. You're experimenting with different styles...experiment with different hooks as well.   You should release Clout as a video or anime video. Probably my favorite song you and Adam did with nova on the hook. Keep up the great work !!!
Video is so good! Production is crazy
Damn. Love the song, but seriously the video is insane. Each video, song, album is uniquely awesome, but you can really see your entire teams evolution. Crazy, but love it.
Worth the wait Tom thank you for the millionth time for killing it💪
Thankful for the text notification. Youtube did not send one. 😒
Omg. This rap is so perfectly rock and roll.
🔥🔥🔥🙏🏻🤘🏻🎸
The lyrics tell a story, and to all ages it wakes them up
Holy shit, this is awesome! Nice departure from you other work, I really dig this shit
I just wish it was a little longer,,, Love the Music & Hook. This was So Good & Thank You Tom & Nova You Killed It with Viv's.
Hangover Gang Takeover
Absolute 🔥 Much love from Arkansas
Lenda 🇧🇷💜
Wow great song , but damn nova great video
You need a tour!! Come on! 🔥 🔥
the verses got much better at the end
Tommy Mac at it again! You the man dude
Again,and again, great work both of you .
Pqp mano
Love  This ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Holy shit!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
don't know who we dissing, but I am down!  #hogforlife
WOoo the ENERGY Mr Tom Ms Nova I see the VISIONS the hairs was energized 💃💃🔥🔥💃💃🔥💪😎🛡️⚔️🇨🇱🇺🇸⚡🦅👋👋👋👋
MONSTROOOO 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🤜🏽🤛🏽
Another kick ass banger! This old man can't get enough of you and Nova's great artwork! I'm 67 now and hope I'm still listening when I'm in my 70's and e 80's you are a wordsmith with no equals. I also hear a lot of your rock-'n'-roll roots in your hooks. I can't say enough how much I appreciate you spitting truth for the masses
Yet another instant classic
I love the crickets!
This one has definitely been worth the wait, and all the hype.
FUCK YES!!!! (1 Million Flame Emojis 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥)
Video is great but definitely the worst song I've herd from tom
Awesome song and Nova's video game is amazing.  Just a quick question though....how many times did you accidentally sit in a chair wearing that jacket and how many chairs got ruined?  LOL.
Tom can’t miss. Another great song, video production 🔥 af, way to do it Nova, keep putting them out and I will keep buying. This country needs more like you!
I would have saved doing a video for another song like "Lone Wolf" with Madchild, but this was okay.
THE CGI IS AMAZING. THE TONE OF YOUR VOICE. THE FIRE IS LIT BOYS!!! GET SOME!!!
Yooo who’s he talking to?
Wow you and Nova out did yourself on the visuals! Great video!!!
Awesome video Tom, you, Nova, and Jared did a great job. Thank you for continuing to break the monotony of modern music and giving people everywhere a chance to experience something deeper and more meaningful. Everyone has different taste in music and everyone has unique views on what is "masterful" or "timeless." For me personally, music is much more than just something to bob heads to and your music is on another level of talent that I can appreciate.
Another solid one😈😈😈
Goddamn guitar killed it
Fantastic production value, great video. Not my favorite song, but some people think cucumbers taste better pickled...
I watched, listened and commented.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🤘
Badass aesthetic
All really added this to my Playlist
He's changing and hes more dark than ever. My score is a 2 on this one
Holy shit dude.. nailed it again and the visuals are equally dope! congrats!
Yeeeessss
LOVE!!!!

Tom McDonald is with the Illuminati. How else did he get all them skulls to shoot this music video?
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Visuals to this  song is off the chain!!!
Tom you DOPE man!! Keep up the hard work. Been following you for awhile now. Keep raising the bar! Sky’s the limit!!
Love the video man you and nova worked really hard  an this video is awesome love how the you standing on the skulls really cool man badass video did a great job
From politics to industry songs back to politics back to industry songs.
That's some Hi Quality Video effects! Nice job.
This Shit IS GAS...........
everything to similar
I I I I It's all about I
I'd LOVE to remix this...the guitar parts could have made this EPIC...
Video is really cool. Songs good but short. Looking forward to the next new video.
Holy f#ck...I'm speechless 🙊
love it keep it up wonderful job tom an nova
Aside of the craziest music video out there, the production is mind-blowing, crazy drip and incorporation of different sounds!I already listened to it on Spotify like a thousand times now!
Love it... like all of you songs.. They are so real.
Fuck yes i thought it was gonna be political again. Good shit.
I'm surprised by the vfx usually it's practical effects. Fun song
Visuals are mad - it's especially cool that most metal bands would kill for having that setting, and yet it also fits some braggadocio
loving the drill style 🔥
BRO the Visuals are outta this world!!! AND the vocals are the best!!! Dude, you've surpassed "Made it" . I am happy for you Tom, I've followed the come-up and it is thrilling to say the least...
Dope AF
Every time I think you you can't trump the previous song, you smash it again
Dope
Nova, girl: you are the queen! Tom: what else is new...still so very good!
👏🏻👏🏻 Great job. Love it
Please come to Texas so many fans here!!!!
Dude!!! You and your team never fail to astound me! The visuals are fucking phenomenal! Hell ya! Celebrate your success! Keep it up!
❤
Droppin 🔥 as always .
love it! Fire as always.
Love it. Love everything about it.
30k in a 0 minutes very impressive bro
YES TO THE ROCK INFUSION! Video prodiction is fire.
I really like the vibe on this one.
Tom,Adam,Upchurch all dropped a new song in less than 24hrs!!!! The day can’t get any better.. 🤘🏻😁🤘🏻
Wow 👀💙💃💃💃💃
Hell yeah here before a million
What's the first thing I do when I open my eyes? "LISTEN TO TO MCDONALD'S NEW FUCKIN  BANGER" 🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😝
Watch video. Get text message at about 2:36 informing me about Tom MacDonald's new song RIOT is out now! Sweet!
I feel much anger in this one
Uhhhhmmmmm......... Not be a dick. But this one kinda let me down. See, I'm used to Tom having hot takes on current events. With a title like riot, i thought for sure he was going to talk about the escalating social unrest and talks about civil war. The visuals are great, the instruments were stellar, but the lyrics were lackluster.      I love Tom's work. I got all his CD's signed. He is on my daily driver list. Biggest reason for that being is because I feel like I'm finally listening to someone be different from the rest. I feel like his music is revolutionary and eye opening. This however, felt like I was listening to another regular rapper. Which Tom definitely isn't. I'm sorry, but I'm not feeling this one...
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Learn more at #ministertimothypresents 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
A solid catchy chorus A non preachy/ woke song. I like this
Song was fire for sure i got it on repeat... In my opinion Nova out did her self with this video.
keep going Tom. don't stop.
🤘H.O.G TILL DEATH TILL DEATH🖕
Absolute banger and the video is pure class! Tom and Nova schooling the rest of them out there.
Imagine if Tom actually did show up and did a tour. Being independent I imagine he would make an insane amount of money...
Truth. Always the truth. Tom and Nova never backing down. 👏👏👏
This is like next level sick dude
LOVE IT🥰
That Beat though,,,
skeleton part in the video is just amazing :p   not my fav song of yours but will always  like video you make because your tom ;)
H.0.G.
Love me some Tom Macdonald but this song is not in his top 10 at all...
I don't like your music anymore. First few songs you made were great. Kinda going downhill. Corny AF. SORRY.
Great song and great video been waiting for this tom macdonald you are one of the greats keep up the grind
❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
Thanks 🙏
Love it, more guitars in the future please! :D
Tom and Adam dropping songs in the same day. The industry isn't ready for this.
Yep yep DID IT AGAIN!!!!
The most epic! This video gave me people-bumps! You keep that flame burning, Tom! You and Nova, are top, mutha fluffin' notch! Much Love, Fam! 💜

Absolutely love it
need a collab with UPCHURCH!! two artists united, not fighting, independent, cause they work the hardest, just being modest the media hates them they can't control them they won't chart them and they can't stop them.
YES!! OMG 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😍
on the right side of the facemask is an upside down cross  0:23  -  0:24  it goes by quickly so pause and replay. This dude is programming you and is a SELLOUT
Thanks for video love the effects and imagery
Amazing as always. Love your music and the amount of work you and Nova put it shows. Keep doing what you do and be you.
legendary freestyle 2->https://youtu.be/TuicMslyNs8
A bit different but fucking awesome as fuck bro. Never ever disappointed when you release your work. Much love to the whole HOG family ❤️🤘 love y'all badasses.
Love it Tom! Maybe you know or maybe not but how you stand up to the music industry on your own and doing your thing and being successful at it, is the same thing as what $AMC and $APE is doing with the stock market. Take a look when you got a chance. It might surprise you.
One of my favorite of Tom's songs. Wish it were longer.
I've heard 30 sec... I'm hooked HOG
🔥❤️‍🔥🔥❤️‍🔥🔥❤️‍🔥🔥❤️‍🔥🔥❤️‍🔥🔥❤️‍🔥🔥❤️‍🔥🔥
Yo! This is the most Metal song Tom Macdonald has done so far!  That bass and guitar chords! I'm working on a metal cover all ready...
This made my day better!
iNLEFT MY OVERWATCH GAME WHEN I SAID THIS TRACK WAS OUT THEY STARTED CALLING ME A MAGAT AND IVERMECTIN AND SHIT IM LIKE L8R COMP GAME....ALBERTA CANDA'S LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH IS UNKNOWN CAUSE OF DEATH! NO SHIT LOOK IT UP
🔥🔥🔥
Your videos are better then the big labels, and its just you and 3 family members. Y'all killin it!
Get adam vibes on this..  hmmm  ..  he drop today too
Blew my speaker 🔊🔥🤘🏻
This is a little too close to that mumble rap shit that is just ear rape. Sorry, Tom... This one ain't it, chief.
The sample was sick!
Thought you said this wasn't going to be like anything you've ever done before? Started listening because you had a different message to everyone else, but it seems like that's all you are, same message in every song.
Novas skills are reaching new heights!!!!!
👍👍👎👎👎
Hell yeah distorted guitars :D maybe you can try some 8 string guitar for next time ;)
🔥🔥🔥🔥. Another great one. The guitar is Amazing. Visuals Amazing. Thank you.
So hard!!! As always it's 🔥🔥🔥
I'm digging the crunchy guitars on this one... very choice! Thanks for the vid Tom!
This one is mid as fuck
Completely wicked!!! 👏👏👏🔥🔥🔥
This is fucking awesome 🔥   Come to England pleaseeee, with a cherry on top 🙏  😄

Love the crickets! Respect
That’s dope Tom, keep up the good work. Return the favor and like my comment!
Tom just went full drake on us.  Sorry fam im out.
its great but names is still my fav so far
NoLifeShaq reaction is going to be Crazy!  🔥🔥🔥🔥
A fellow believer, I see. When they see the first picture, their hearts will fail.
Don't forget to like this vid
Oh.. crickets in the background.  Reminds me that 'they' want us to eat crickets and mealy worms while (presumably) the few farm animals left will end up on 'their' tables only (because its okay when 'they' use carbon or eat veal in fancy restaurants because 'they' are smarter and deserve luxuries unlike 'us'.) Any plans to do a song about their coming meal menu for the global deplorables not part of the technocrat aristocrat overlords/ serfs scene?
Top notch!!! As always. AWESOME!!! ❤
I would love for you to do a MAGA song Trump can play at his rallies :)
Every time you and your team drop a new song , video the bar just keeps geting higher and higher. it must feel good looking down on the  rest of the music indestory  from so far above. great editing ,great effects and amazing song.keep killing it homies,                                                                                                        Thank you , Fan For Life

Just got done listening and watching the video time I have to say dope I'll give a better answer when I'm home and I watch it on the big screen and listen through the house stereo
Cool video
Sounds too close to mumble rap with this one. Not a favorite, but will always support you!
Holy shit I love that! Love the dark feel to it, the aggression, the power! Epic video as always Man! Once again another huge track! Well done dude...as always right at the top when it comes to quality!
Amazing as always!!!

Epic🎶🔥 HOG gang

🔥🔥🔥🔥
He said on crip?
ABSOLUTE 🔥 🔥 🔥🔥 as always
🔥🔥!!
I’m loving all the background instruments. It really has given some new depth to your music!  Keep evolving or stay the same, either way you’re awesome! 🤓🙌🏻
Tbh, not feeling this one. "White Pac" was a much more accurate line when Eminem said it. Great video, good production, decent  track. 6/10.
The song is decent. Not my favorite for sure but the Videography looks great!!! Keep up the great work you two! Best of Luck Tom!
Usually I like your chorus less than everything else in your songs, but the chorus in this one is one of my favorite. Just sounds so dark and cool
🔥🔥🔥
You smashed this one off the f'ing continent. This is one Bada$$ INDEPENDENT song and video. Props to (beautiful) Nova also. You continually move the bar higher and higher with each new song/video. It is pretty cool to see y'all keep matching and moving that bar each and every time. Keep giving the (corrupt) industry a massive Superman punch 👊 👊 👊 to the nethers.
Lol songs too short I want more! 😁
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I love this song 🔥🔥
Already on the playlist!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🥵🥵🥵
This beat is awesome. Another great song. Thank you Tom and Nova keep it up.
Awesome, as always!! <3
Dope AF!!!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥
"I am on the independent Mount Rushmore, you a fucking nobody, you a legit clown." We all know these untalented YouTube rappers are screaming from the top of their ladders after hearing that lyric.
this is DOPE AF. Tom you and Nova are SAVAAGGGGEEEEEE.
Love it!!!!
Ohhhhh shiney shineyyy
The first thing I thought of was this is Trump rapping to Biden.  Huge rally turnouts and crickets for the other guy.  Kinda funny 😁!
Cheers from Oklahoma brother 👍 🙌 🙏
I'm a huge TMD fan, but I honestly don't care for this one.  Please make a video to "Heroes" , "Hello Hollywood" , or "Just Like Me"
These videos!!! Damn if I didn't know better I would never believe this was done by a independent artist. Good job guys this is a awesome video!
Can’t talk, need to breathe and than watch it again…
amazing production. good for you. I'm glad to see you shine.
Not my favorite cadence wise, just not my style. but the vfx and film production are dope as fuck!
Your quality was already top like 2 years ago and you just keep outdoing yourself with the music, but now you're outperforming signed artists on the visual level too.   You're a threat. Everybody knows it. Keep it up.
Acal and Tom releasing on the same time?! :O
Great song for whats coming
Wow, He did it again. This man is a brain to mouth lyricist. He can convert a thought to work without even trying. I got some names for you Tom. Genius, amazing, sexy, keep doing you Tom. WE LOVE IT! And that cover art is fantastic! Great job on the video Nova!!!!
H O G FOREVER! FOREVER!!!!!
Let's Fucking Go! Another heater!!!
I love all your suff not liking that one
So who pissed off Tom cause that ain't cool man
EVERYWHERE I GO’S A RIOT🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wellllllll I have a new favorite.... From the beat, lyrics, and video... Top tier holy shit 🤯🤯💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥
Yes!!!
Hard Core!
Wanna hit the gym together bro?
Nova, just when I think you can't make things more visually stunning - YOU DO! I'm blown away by how impactful and purposeful each shot is. You are a master! You rock! Tom, you keep hammering out such great songs - I don't know how you do it! I was so excited for today and I'm not disappointed! I will share and download!
Not my favorite song but nice video.
Tom.........he dropped it on a Friday AGAIN.  He owns Fridays.  In 21 minutes he has 21,000 views.  Killing it.
Meh, not feeling this one, still support you and still waiting for more from Nova.
Love the crickets.
Straight bumping this all daaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyy
Is he wearing white contacts?
Independent
Is cool video sick beat thanks for doing what you do
Well he now has hit another platform! Next out will be a full heavy rap rock album. Crazy shit is he will make that genre better just like he makes rap better or punk for that matter
fire
Goat
This is gonna be a riot of a comment section. 🔥🔥
Damn!!!! Tom!!!! Yeeeaaaahh Boi!! Head banger!
The visuals are crazy on this one! Nice guitar work too.
So Adam and Tom both drop a music video on the same day damn near at the same time and Tom's song sounds like a sneak diss but to whom I wonder.
He still hates hiphop...
WE ONLY DO DOPE SHIT!!!     🔥🔥HOG🔥🔥
i love when Tom drops ego-bars. the political and conscious stuff is coo but im here for the agro vibes
This keeps getting better can't wait for the new album hang over gang forever
Yes👍 Tom Macdonald that I know is back! The visuals are epic! Maybe this whole experience was to evolve you to the next level! Don’t let MSM trigger you ever.
This is what I woke up for today, great way to start my weekend. Everything you do is amazing. Keep going. Don't let anyone buy you. You have shown you can do this on your own. Even my father in his 60's appreciates the lyrics
i love it
Honestly the visuals are sick brooo💥💯 The Beat is a montser The lyrics, from what I know about Tom McDonald, Not the best bars he's ever dropped, but not trash either.
Talk that shit 🔥🔥🔥
meh, weak lyrical content.  Felt like "I Have More Fans Than You." the song.  Pass.
Hi
Get those likes up.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🖤🔥🔥🔥🔥
“Till I’m dead I swear I’ll do it my way, grindin out my life , now everyday is Friday.” Happy “Tom Macdonald” Friday y’all!
Dope
Том, Восторг! Береги себя! 👍🔥🔥🔥
19 mins and 22k views!💪💪🧡👍
VFX artist did a very nice job. And another hell of a banger track. TGIF
Not my favorite song, but visually was amazing..
Please tour!
First time listening I didn't care for it but I think it's because I wasn't really listening to the words, but my second time I listened to it the song is awesome. Great as always keep it up
I remember when Tom said he doesn't do auto tune...what happened to that..videos cool
Love the song but was hoping it would come with an album drop announcement. #Hangovergang Wigan
Nailed it. Again. Keep it up.
You, Nova and Jared CRUSHED IT!! Great job.
Absolutely amazing!!! Like always! You continue to bring great hits! ❤️‍🔥
Take you self off TOUR it's the Antichrist system
Well that was I don't gave words but he did thank you both it's !!!!!!!!!!!
Tom I was here in the first 20 minutes   Ps/ how do you handle the anxiety
Can someone please call the coroner… there’s dead bodies errrywhere! 🪦
And the videos better then half the people with record labels and big fancy expensive teams 😅😅🔥🔥🔥🔥🤘🏻
this is pure🔥🔥🔥
OK... this is going to sound crazy, but... I can see clothing line sold at Hot Topic and other rockish stores as well as high end stores called "Nova".  All these fantastic jackets, tshirts, masks, caps... omg.  Course y'all couldn't do that all by yourself - idk - you deserve all the success there is out there.  Love the song man, as usual - very cool.
ok.  i was expecting this today, but i wasn't expecting the wolf to hit this hard today.
Another banger. Love your music much needed in the times we living in.
😮❤️
OMG, I FRIGGEN LOVE IT, VISUALS WERE FABULOUS !!! WOWWW
I love you and your music style/lyrics/everything.  but honest review? it's definitely not my favorite song that you put out recently... I still think your great though, and Nova is a beast with these  videos. I would like to see her in some of them too though!
<<<-- Hit Like if you ❤❤❤ Tom & Nova!! 👍👍
I sure hope he pays nova well because she does amazing work. Hollywood grade work
Dam son ! That was badass.  I love the beat in this fo sho
I'm never disappointed 🤟
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
President Tom Macdonald 🇺🇸
I only wish it were longer. Amazeballs again! But of course.
Your music is so great and inspiring! You and nova did a amazing job with this one, ceep it up! Hang over gang for life!
"I just wanna be a legend, while I'm still alive It's seems like hella rappers goin' platinum, when they die It's gravestones It's gravestones" Tom MacDonald
Luv the digs !!! Keep doing what you do tom ( n nova) . It rials ya haters n ya fans love u even more ! 🤣🤣🤣
👑🧠🤯 Oh Yessssss🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥
Another banger!!!! 😁💯❤️
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Gym anthem for sure
Your musicality gets better with every released keep going dude this is one of my favourite musical pieces
Bro aint nobody messing with these visuals absolute fire 🔥🔥
That guitar riff is very chunky I like this style definitely blasting the hell outta this one
I am a metal  listener but back in my youth I would listen to the rap genre. Then they stop telling stories or messages. You do I enjoy listening to you music thank you for being the artist that you are
Another hitter! Nova keeps stepping her game up too!
Phenomenal!!!! Loved the song. Nova KILLED it again. Thanks for all of your hard work!
It’s good. But the songs about current events, exposing government corruption & calling out the criminal politicians on the left are easily my favorite. And I feel like he just does much better on those songs as well.  Regardless Tom is the new GOAT.  LOL.
You did it again, Tom! 🔥🔥🔥 I’ll be listening all day 😎 amazing work on the video!
These beats vibe with my soul!!
Best fucking song yet dude keep that shit up
Great music! But can we just say WOW NOVA! amazing visuals 😍 👏
yessss!!!!!!! 🔥
Always gonna love Tom.  This vid was not my favorite, but still first-class work by Tom and Nova.
As I listen to this song and watch the video all I can think about is how awesome this would be as a show opener on tour this song right here is a show opener love this song
6 feet deep, that's an underground rapper! Slay on with that
This is my new favorite of his.
Music never gets old from u bro mush love keep on keeping on
Beautifully Executed in every aspect!! Well done Tom and Nova
Astonishing bro. Truth speaker of a generation. Meditation. Aiming straight for the seems of the matrix
Nice east coast flow!!! Tom you are the man and those visuals! You were right, they are fire...see what I did there! 🤣🤣🤣
Bros gone legendary 👾👽❤🖤
just 🔥🔥🔥🔥🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘😁
Videoclip Awesome!
Ann. I am a Great Grandma who loves what you Tom, Nova and your group are sharing. Thank you ALL🙏🏼👍🏼🏆💐
Another banger!! Absolute 🔥  #HOG #tommacdonald #novarockafeller
just let me say that I am not into rap music nor the industry. it just seems to harsh for me. always coming at each other...always. and the message is all the same..."i've seen and done worse and so has your momma with a glock and shorty at my crib"...or whatever...lol. metaphorically speaking, of course. I relate to absolutely NONE of that. But there is something different about the hangover gang, Tom and Nova. the message, the music, the whole package has me so dang curious of what comes next. Thanks for everything you guys strive for...it is truly a blessing in some very weird way.
Dope visuals Tom, I think I am a little lost with the branding though 😭 why you doing coke if alcohol was already a demon
As always droppin heat
The visuals of standing on the bones of our enemy was an awesome touch. Great job Nova! Tom is looking good and sounding great. Gotta remind them fools who's on top right now!
Yet another fire song!! Like always, Nova did an amazing job with the video, and Jared Potter did a great job with vfx.
Love it ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

ashes 2.0 🤘🤘💀
This is fire💥💥
TOM WENT INSANE WITH THIS ONE!!!
Great production values. Interesting sound. But the middle fingers in the air phrase is getting a little overdone. And the lyrics are sort of inside baseball to me.
inverted  cross !?

Tom NEVER disappoints!!!  #hangovergang #hog4life
Reaction to this coming tonight if any of y’all like to watch reactions another fantastic video Tom!
With what I believe is coming this is unsettling.
VFX by Potter and you can tell :D
Damn dude. I might not like every song or some of your ideology and that's ok we are different and that's great. But damn NOONE can't say you can't rap. Cuz dude you rapped the hell out of this one.
Yeah, give Nova the props! The videos really bring it!
Let's gooo🔥💯🔥
Sick! ❤️
Hell yeah brother
Excellent👌👌👏👏
🖤🖤🖤
Fire
Spot on lyrical truth commend you brother peace ✌️ Tom
Love the metal 🎸🎸🎸🎸
Love it tom
I wrote this song!
Love the video.. Nice to hear a good rap beat from you again! 😉
Yeah, not my favorite. Past few songs I haven't been into much, but still a fan. No one's going to love every song you put out, so I'll just keep blasting the ish I like until the next release. #HOG4LIFE
You were more appealing when you were addressing the political and social injustices.
As always speaking TRUTH.
Oh man the effects, the look on your face Tom Mcdonald an the emotion I csn feel it. So much feeling in this song. So much intensity.  Man  oh man
Song 🔥🔥🔥🔥 Video 🔥🔥🔥🔥 SFX 🔥🔥🔥🔥  #HOG4LIFE
Tom have you heard of a Vet, Country singer, named Derek Johnson ? He proves through LAW,&,ORDER, Xiden is NOT your President.  3hrs but 250 yrs of history   https://youtu.be/yo_LKEE9XhA
When's the tour date though?  Imagine. He releases a tour date with a music video. Keep going bro. It's a riot. You're and inspiration, and a great role model.
Bro that first guitar riff DUH DUh DUH got me so hyped. Fire song from start to finish like 5 different flows this is real music. Fuck the industry
This is 🔥            awesome video.    Awesome song.
You did it again Tom! This ish slaps hard!!;)
The lyrics are awesome, the video is insane, as always good job bro.
I'm subscribed but didn't get an alert for this. But I got one for Adam's gumbo. Keep it up!!!!
I’m so glad that I was introduced to Tom MacDonald ever since I started listening to his music a few months back. I’ve been listening to songs from him from years back up till today, and I love them all; once I move, I’m going to buy merch. I hope more people can find his music. I try to promote him on my social media so others can see him. I wish there were more people like Tom. We need this more than ever, and society￼ I honestly keep on listening to the Mac lethal diss videos It’s hilarious
Now my weekend will be complet 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥#HOG4Life
Fire as always. Love the asynchopatic delivery. Punches the lines home 💪💥❤️‍🔥
unfortunately not a fan of this one.
Keep doing what you're doing. I can't count how many people I've turned on to you and Nova! This is like the 5th time I've listened to this today!
The vfx was sick.
This is the best beat and best video done to date.
HOLY-HELL!!!!! KNOCK MY ASS TO THE GROUND!!!! I'M FREAKIN' BLOWN AWAY. VISUALS - HOT! VOCALS - HOT! IT'S A F'ING RIOT!!!! #HangOverGang
Noice
Dope 👍
Nova, Nova, Nova...topped yourself on this one.  Tom killing the lyrics as usual.
Love this!
Good stuff seems the end is near less pray to god Jesus. Revaluation is going true
Still here till I die, ill always support those who stand against tyranny.
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Fantastic!
Dude you put on serious muscle. Congrats.
Another fire ass banger from Tom, damn good brother. God bless 🙏
Song-Amazing! Video-Next level -out of this world! You-Hot as hell! ❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥
Knocked it out of the park Nova!
;)
Legit gave me goosebumps. Lol
Visuals are mind blowing. Music is good, especially with that guitar part. Lyrics are blah blah typical rap bragging crap talking pointless mumbo. I'm a fan but not on this one
You already had a fantastic videographer in nova. Jared Potter is taking your videos to the next level. Congratulations on the new addition to your team and you are building out an amazing independent crew!
Well, I love it. And I was just noticing on your Wikipedia page that they do not mention anything about you being INDIE! I'm indie too. (Books, not music) and they hate us. Just hate us when we don't have to play their games.
No surprise, another banger! 👍
Today’s a good day.💯🤘🏻
Love your music
Nicely done.  You are truly showing artists the world over that they don't need to be slaves to a label, just put in the work and make your own magic.
Ty once again !
The greatest blessing is children, Having money and a career is great, But one day its not enough to get a person out of bed, But having someone else who depends on you is, A man wants to provide for , That is burned in our DNA, We love to see others smile for the sacrifices we make, Rock on Tom. But your right, Your blessed
Another banger!! Keep putting out these slappers! Hooah, Climb to Glory!! HOG for LIFE!!
fire🔥️🔥️🔥
Tom amazing stuff man!  Thank you for coloring outside the lines, your an inspiration

Love it Tom
Go buy his song!!! Make Tom #1 on itunes!!
Sad here in UK then Tom and Adam upload happiness
You Sir never disappoint...simply amazing
This is something you would see not knowing him and assume it was a production agency doing all the heavy lifting editing and producing these. INDEPENDENT is an understatement for what yall have accomplished thus far. HOG!
Sir Tom… arise and take your crown
the visuals are insane.  Great job.
EVERYWHERE I GOES A RIOT!!! TOM MAC IS BACK BABBY!! ALWAYS LEGENDARY MUSIC!!

Love the metal guitar chunking.
dude i like the eyes nova your video editing  is amazing cheers
OK, I can get my Tom's day started!
Keep it up TOM!!!
Man Timpool was right Tom macDonald slaps.
Love the instrumental and the video!! One of the best. Lyrically though...not worth the wait or hype. Maybe I've been spoiled by your other great songs?
yeh i don't think that was a good song. slow rapping is just bad, and the drops were just forgettable. hopefully the next one is better. considering how many good songs you've made in the past, im sure the next one will be good.
Another push or encouragement to do some pop up shows! Be honored to be bouncing in the HOG pin
sick work out beat. well done tom and nova, thank u.
Absolutely Visually stunning, yet another killer hook. Love it
Yaaaassss Tommmmm
Good song
Thanks for another fantastic piece of art💕
Great job Tom and Nova! Love this one. The vibe is unreal, the drip is unreal. Lookin swole af Tom 💪 Keep it up guys
Daaaaamn! 🔥

Here we go again.   Another one........ Hit maker!!!!!!!!
ANOTHER GREAT  SONG AND VIDEO 💯 LOVE IT !!!! YOU ALWAYS ROCK !!!!
Love the intense rap/rock Tom!
Who's he talking about??
Badass brother!!! Love it!
Interesting song. Kinda different from most of his stuff. pretty good though. I think if the autotune in some parts wasn't used and used better in other parts it would sound a bit better but still a banger.
My man Tom is dropping it like it's hot again. Lol.. love you big!!! Awesome job!
Pull it off every time!! Sounds amazing. Love the riffs!!!
The guitar and skull and bones tornado with the killer breaks, Riot is 🔥
I legit don't even know what to say.  Amazing song.  Also, the production quality of this video is off the charts.
Most certainly a banger
Man you were right about those visuals that’s badass man
The only complaint I got is it wasn't long enough! That is definitely a banger!
Another masterpiece. Disappointed its edited for clean lyrics,  but i get the youtube algorithms dont get you the same views when youre unfiltered
There’s so much to this video that we don’t see, the reflection of the world, the persistence of Tom, it’s all so good
Wow! I am not Quiet! This song and video is too good!
God Bless President Donald J Trump
Dude another killer video. Wish there were more people like you. Down to earth, straight to the point and no bullshi$. Keep these videos coming. Have a great weekend sir and can't wait until the next one.
Tom is one of the very few hip hop artists I Actively seek out, especially when I know he’s releasing a new song! Awesome song that guitar riff badass!
AWESOME VIDEO! #HOG4LIFE

Wow. I won't say that I like rap now just because I enjoy , so far , all of your tunes. I will say simply that I appreciate that your " sound" is rhythmic and melodic, and had my head bopping involuntarily.  Great work . Out work yesterday my friend.

This video is amazing. 👏🏻
Tim Pool said he will speak about your video the entire week.

🐐🐐🐐
Dude this is awesome and I know ypu had to have partied at New City Suburbs back in the day. This song has so many great industrial undertones. Would love to see you meld your rap with some hard industrial metal or agrotech. That would wake people asses up.
Love you brother!, New Orleans Louisiana!!!
tom needs some drama in his life. his music is better when stuff is tough.
Another 🔥🔥🔥🔥 song Tom! And Nova... amazing video! Best out there! #HangOverGang forever ♥️
I fucking love this!  The guitar riffs add a lot.  I totally miss rap core.  This is fantastic. You are the 🐐!

I can’t say it’s my favorite melodically, but that guitar is terrific, Tom!   Honestly, I feel you should try for a full metal-rap hybrid song in the future, much like Linkin Park was doing in their early days.
that guitar went hard as fuuuc!
to anybody that's trying to hate on time just know he only posted this video 8 minutes ago and there's already five plus thousand views you can't deny the toms the f****** goat and so is Nova
Awesome video good job Tom and Nova 🔥🔥🔥

It's a good song no doubt but I don't think it's a banger just not as great as Tom's others songs but it is a good song no doubt I like the beat just it's a banger I think but it is a good song so I'm not saying the song sucks I just don't think it's a bang will I play song often probably nor I'll listen to his other songs more than this

Tom is controlled opposition. In his lyrics on other songs he says he sold his soul and that he is better than Jesus.
That was certainly worth the wait! Now to listen in a silent place to hear the nuances.
This is such a well shot video. The music as always hits hard. All around pretty amazing.  Really enjoyed it and will be adding it to my long af tom macdonald Playlist
Love this. Keep it up Tom
🔥🔥
Wish I could see you live on stage but you might need so much dam security lol I dont wanna loose ya tom.

HOLY FUCK! ANOTHER MASTERPIECE! I GOT GOOSEBUMPS THE WHOLE VIDEO
Let's gooooooo....
NICE Tom!!! 🔥🔥🔥. (I think I can judge fairly with my name. Music… specifically lyrics are everything to me.)
HOG FOR LIFE
Huge fan of Tom, but this was a miss. Less music about the music industry, please.
WHY SO QUIET?! 🤫
Beautiful video and song.  Thank you #Tom Macdonald. Hope your doing good and have a wonderful day. 🙂
Meh, pretty Mid for Tom tbh.... but this wasnt supposed to be a smash hit. Tom out here jus vibin.
Wow !!! 😮
Yeahhhh, you was right Tom, the visuals are insane and they are definitely popping. Good job bro, thanks for content 😁😁😁.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
such a sick video and song!
Yes!!! This was exactly what I needed. Happy to see a new release! Much love!
Duddeeee fire! Love how the music cuts on the “why so quiet” lines. Thank you Tom!
Love the visuals NOVA!!!!!!
Feels like a movie. Big ups brother.
Your own style! This is why I love it so much. You are your true self and we feel it. Evolving in each clip. The power of authenticity!
🔥
A lot of people love this very short song and that's awesome. But I felt personally that it fell very short of what I was hoping for. The guitars are an interesting addition and the vocals are fine but the song as a whole and the way the song is structured just didn't work for me. I respect everyone else who enjoys this song but to me it's def not Tom's best work. A bit disappointment for me.
DOOOOOPPPPEEEEEEE
Another banger bro! Love the visuals! This one’s definitely going to the top of the charts! Long live the Hangover Gang!
Those effects go hard. But these lyrics are even harder.
Sick af. Per usual
Ok...this was intense! Amazing!! Nothing but facts yet again! You never disappoint!
Absolute Fire 🔥  The video is just, I don't have a word, absolutely Amazing.  Nova is the best. Tom is the GOAT. Every song he drops gets better and better.  #HOG

Why do quiet 🦗🦗🦗  Love it! 🔥🔥🔥 Gonna be blasting this in my car for awhile.
