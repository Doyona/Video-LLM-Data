3 bottles of very obviously champagne  Lilly and Toast for some reason: That's wine, right?
I would evict myself from any house that has a fridge like #2 immediately. That's nightmare fuel.
Toast is the ugliest im filled with boredom hearing his mouth talk
Soo much Korean
WHO PUTS BATTERIES IN THE FRIDGE????! 1:40
Can we get another one of these. But that goes with the original  title. I loved rating all these fridges. Its kinda frightening what these people got in there fridges. The fact it was mainly Drinks, Condiments and takeout is kinda sad, As I am a professional cook for 10 years. But that makes checking out peoples fridges that much more exciting. Honestly If you took these "Streamers" fridge. And swapped them out for their parents Fridges it would be waaaaaaayy less freighting. Just regular everyday normal fridges. But that wouldnt be as exciting. The fact that they are rather successful and not struggling, makes for weird dietary choices, along the way
he's dm rigot
it defys phsyics like that
god agrees tur
sucked into th ed meme
those fuckers shading sauerkraut even though kimchi is the same fucking thing im losing it
heavily judging charlie for getting the squeeze tube sour cream instead of the tub
Ahh, what a mistake. Confusing a Diet Coke lover with having Coke Zero
5:56 The fact that this whole time i thought Liquid Death was alcohol until I saw it in the shops where the energy drinks are XD
jummychu is lowkey disgusting ....
The Wendy and Abe fridge.
Sauerkraut is just German Kimchi.
Honestly, Toast is 100% correct about the apple juice. I often don't even fully put away the groceries before I drink the first glass.
Damn, the Atsu part aged like milk
“He’s nice” that aged well
Where is the next episode?  I've been waiting for way too long
needs initiad d playing for jummy
via li is my fave streamer I feel a stream of ranting
Celcius is a pre workout lol and it doesn’t even have a lot of caffeine… like 150mg in the small cans. A cup of coffee is right around there or a little more.
Where's the next episode maan?
ensure is actually a meal substitute, i was given it in the hospital after being diagnosed with an ed
The severe lack of cooking ingredients in these fridges is shocking.
4:50 the way he grabs her 😂
Did Toast want to be friends with Charlie?
This is just a brother bothering his sister 😂
All these fridges are so unique and Your videos are amazing😃
Just pure argument
Insure is not to help you poop. It’s protein to help patients gain strength and build body mass to heal faster at hospitals
Julia😂
More!
As you should 😂
Why there is baking soda in fridge #3
Bruh when toast is out of content ^-^
Timmy is Japanese
Julia😂
Hard sweat
You have the know the difference between heart and cold hands.
Celine the sicko
8:19 - I lived in Canada for a bit (BC) and I almost roadkilled a coyote. They're so cute.
We need more of this.
Six of those fridges have the exact same internals (stainless steel back, stainless steel temperature control panel on top, three gunmetal grey shelves mounted on the door).  Did they all shop at the same appliance store or something??  Extremely odd that 6/10 fridges are the same model.  Even though its probably a high end model that take the custom panels.
LOL ATSUUUU
This is funny because all of my roommates including me are asian but not korean.. but we all have our own kimchi
best video ever, haha :)
I thought they all lived together
the apple thing was so real
Hope everyone is doing good and staying safe. If you need to talk to someone or need help, there are people who care. Sending support and hearts. ❤️❤️❤️
The astounding
Uber be dropping dog be
Moistcr1tikal had the trickiest one. There are only 2 types of people that have endless amounts of high protein yogurt (he even had oikos expensive ass yogurt) and if you look at the top he has pedialyte. He's either old af or a body builder. Most people don't know penguinz is a body builder because of his sleeper build.
14:45 😂
I love Toast and Lily's dynamic LMAO
Why did I get an urge to close a fridge?
I'm White as fuck and I have kimchi and a ton of eggs in my fridge
No meat ingredients in any if them
Before I even get to 3, has to be a big ocd dude.
The fact that ATSU a genshin streamer is on here but the roomies isnt is WILD!
charlies fridge is so concerning hellp
Toasted l
If my fridge were on here there'd be nothing to be embarrassed about because it's empty
On that second one is no one going to mention the duracell batteries in the fridge
Please bring this back!
I’m white as hell, but I have a tub of kimchi 😂   I had a Korean exchange student live with us for 2 years growing up, and her mom sent home made kimchi, and I’ve been hooked ever since I was like 11
anyone notice the Duracell batteries in the top left of the fridge at 1:39 ?
"can you buy me food" "??? this is your stream wheres my food?" lollll
6:10 chicken and other meats that can carry salmonella and other food born illnesses should be on the bottom most shelf especially after being opened because diseases can't look up (no but these things will go whatever shelf you're on and down wind of it)
Toast's apple juice rant was so real. I once drank an entire jug of martinelli's apple juice in one sitting
I assumed they just all lived together… lol I guess it’s none of our business but Lily and Michael don’t live together?! Wth
Good Idea.
Toast is absolutely right about apple juice. I have to stop myself or I'll just end up drinking it all
Janet's fridge is very similar to what I would have
old school camera film lasts long when you keep it in the fridge :D
Batteries in the fridge is actual involuntary commitment behaviour
why the fuck is there FROZEN Pizza in a FRIDGE?!
6:25 points out the kimchi, but not the caymus? 🤔
Kimi
anyone else see the lunchables in Scarra’s fridge
I watched this whole episode?
Oh this was recently?
who puts cooked pasta in their fridge, you put sauce in the fridge and you cook pasta in 10 mins
Personally as a guy I keep batteries nice and cold because it charges the batteries up am I wrong 😀
Honestly I just love the interactions between toast and lily 😂👌☠️
Ein Kommentar
Why did he have to say "Apple juice" so many times. Now I wish I had an unopened bottle of apple juice in my fridge so I could drink the apple juice I am so desperately craving right now
free advertisement for liquid death
toast you are literarily the only one who instantly opens a 2 litter apple juice when you get home stop gaslighting us
Are they siblings? I'm getting real big bro jokingly bullying Lil sis vibes. Idk  Ok so it's not just me. I thought I was being cringe, but lots of people are getting the same vibe. Also, they're not siblings from the 5 sec google.
4:50 the way he holds her😂
#8 is so funny to me because prior to Lily guessing the last one being Janet's because of the Coca-Cola Zero being what she drinks, I saw that single one in there and just presumed it as her 😂.
13:05 i immediately said rae when i saw that-- i've been bamboozled
Moist had the most regular human fridge and I appreciate that
They're good people 😂😂😂😂😂
first thing i noticed from atsu was that the pizza was from waitrose, i remember the branding so well from work
Change the title
6:24 WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MIND PUTS CAYMUS IN THE FRIDGE (It's a high end cabernet sauvignon)
I see big brother and baby sister  vibes
THAT IS NOT COKE ZERO ‼️
I love this concept so much haha, what a great video
Don't put your batteries in the fridge. The cold will discarge your batteries faster than normal.
Scope?
Do another
i can give u photo of my refrigerator i bet u won’t able to find my kimchi
Why do you guys have eggs in your fridges? So unnecessary.
sooooo true about the unopened apple juice.
I can't believe I missed the video of Lily and Toast looking at random fridges when it came out. I'm so glad I found it tonight! This was a cute video idea XD
Where do I send my fridge picture?
Now I know where in LA county you guys live now that you’ve mentioned coyotes. I won’t tell anyone
5:25 ABSOLUTE FACTS. I buy the same bottle and it never makes it to the fridge unopened.
Chaotic duo. Love it😂💙
Calling El Pollo Loco, polo loco is the whitest thing Toast has ever said lol
fookin hell it's a hour passed when i should be asleep and you're getting me hungry for shit i've never had
Is it racist to point out you're pronouncing the Ls in Pollo wrong? 😂
The Lily toast dynamic is great
This video basically consists of 50% toast roasting people’s fridges, and 50% toast abusing Lily 😂
0:53 as a fellow Asian that was the first thing I noticed 😂  1:53 OK not gonna lie I have a whole like drawer of batteries, because apparently it keeps them lasting longer 😂  11:20 OK I’m full Chinese but I literally have like kimchi and like soy bean paste because my family likes it and I use for cooking sometimes
💀💀💀 When I saw atsu I thought this was tuonto and then when I saw toast and Lily again I was like: Whattttt????????
The way toast puts his hand on Lily’s shoulder males me uncomfortable
Toast: Whats the scope Lily: _Stretches the scope for every round_
Mango Habanero isn't actually that hot. It has a great taste though.
you should do a pantry/cabinets version of this
the liquid death gimmick is actually for people who are trying to quit alcohol but don't want to seem like they're not drinking! (ex: at a party)
"This person is definitely Asian" can be said about all of the refrigerators!
16:24 lily hits toast
That bowl, thing , cling , CLING WRAP, cling wrap ! 😹😹🙈☝🏽 It’s  the right word .. but in Canada we call it Plastic wrap, we don’t even read the label , we name it ourselves 😂😹😹😹😹❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
I love these types of vids
😂😂😂
Them: "That's wine right?" Me: "Fuck yeah Martinelli's Apple Cider I salute this fridge!"
sooooo are they a couple or what?
We need this with multipile choice (thumbnail)
Is it weird that just seeing a picture of a fridge left open gives me some form of anxiety
Good video idea. It'd be better if you had multiple choice answers at the bottom
When the video went flashback I got a mr. clean ad…
Toast: “Korean Man…” Lily: “Peter!!!!  (Revealed Edison’s fridge) Toast: “Edison’s Korean right..?” Me thinking: “Isn’t Peter and Edison full brothers??” 😂
I guessed number 5 to be Tina's
My kind of thing. Reminds me the weird vlogs wowcrendor used to make. Walking in a friend's house and filming random fridge to the confusion of everyone. We got to see way to many streamer fridges.   The man will always be an enigma. Then again don't think about it. He probably wasn't thinking.   But great content. Learning to cook and a lot of things. Cool to see groceries and ideas lol
Can't wait to see my own fridge on this show 😂
MAKE THIS A SERIES
oh lol at 1:20 I thought it was "Raid our friends fridge"
3rd fridge picture, 1st impression for me: is this a convenient store?
this was actually really fun to watch haha
Yo tf? Celsius has started to be sold outside of the nordics? That shit has been the staple Swedish energy drink for years now, glad it's finally being recognized in other parts of the world
What a duo
Great vid, like
toast’s grip on lily’s shirt when the person is revealed killed me
tbh i was also taken aback to see newt and atsu like 😭 fr WHATS THE SCOPE OF THIS
the first one was pretty impressive tbh, they did say an Asian girl
LILy : OoOh These are the apple Jasmine tea  ME : gurl- it says oolong tea... and there is no jasmine tea in that fridge at all 🤣💀
The lack of actual 'food food' in these fridges is kind of mind blowing, 90% drink and condiments and 10% takeout leftovers.
Liquid Death is best water brand
half of this video i just asked who these people are💀
awesome game!
LMAO ATSU JAJAAJJA
AHAHHAHAH I DIND'T EXPECT ATSU TO BE HERE
Banger content
It's crazy that this story hasn't made it over to the mainstream media yet
Wendy POG ❤
4/5 of the video it really is just rating fridges 😂these two are hilarious
this is such a fun episode!!!
The title is misleading, click bait 🤣
Does that chick actually talk like that? Who can stand this shit?
11:58 where is that character from?
when i watch the video i constantly feel the need to close the fridge door😅😂
I love that picture of Atsu because I have the same fan XD 12:52
At first I thought toast was held hostage by lily but halfway through I guess I was wrong lmao
Rating fans fridges might actually be fun to wach
You both made me realize if someone saw a photo of my fridge they'd more than likely think I was asian... but I'm not at all. Just love the food way more and get along typically better with the various cultures than most of my ancestral ones.
Listen... Can someone please tell me what Melo Melo is?
lily eat vegatables you cant make videos if you are dead
bonus points for Jojo  :P
so far, no one has chocolate milk, so i agree every one is crazy. just think you could drink chocolate milk with ironmouse
This would have been a great idea for a video... Too bad they didn't agree on the scope 😅
i have seen much worse
18:33  "How did you get pictures of his fridge?" "Networking."
Cant wait for next weeks fridge rating episode.  I expect some complete strangers fridges at this point.  Also Wendy's fridge organization 10/10.
Liquid death is a water company with a goal of reducing plastic waste from water bottles and decided to go with a tin can which is easily recycled.
Sadly, no clout chasing.
LILY IS SO SWEET AND THEN THERES toast
Anyone else was hoping to see Asmongold's fridge on here. I just wanted to know if he still has snacks from 2008 in it....
he aint wrong about the apple juice theory cause i do it too
Seeing the second fridge hit me like "this ref is very Filipino" with the amount of "tupperwares" (lol)...and of course it is.
Most korean families have a separate fridge for kimchi
That after-outro was perfect, lol
This series needs to continue !!!!!
Since we've changed the title to random fridges from anyone ever, I would like to submit a picture of my fridge, which is exclusively kimchi, and one coke zero.
There is something unsettling about looking at open fridges... Even tho these are just pictures, I'm angst about them not being closed
This is a good idea. Very entertaining. 😂👍👍👍
To summarize our lovely Asian streamers: - Kimchi - Liquid Death and/or Ninja Melk - Alcohol - Coke Zero
are all of their friends asian?
nah i dont even wait to get home to crack open the apple juice its in the store
buddy better be careful with those hands... There is a certain psychotic genius boxer robotics engineer crackhead that might not like it. lol
Why do all these people have kimchi? Have you ever been to Korea? Kimchi really isnt that good...
The “Spot the Kimchi” bit got me rolling 😂😂😂
what?!?  you can buy cooked and peeled eggs??  but, why??
Come on guys, kimchi is not exclusive to koreans lol. Non-koreans eat kimchi too 🤣
there’s been a crazy amount of ads in YouTube videos lately 😭(like not even in just his videos, I mean like every YouTube video I watch there’s just a ton of ads)
even tho theyre pictures, i got anxious bc i felt like these fridges were open the whole time :')
Salted duck eggs from the local vietnamese store is pretty dope
11:53 The abrupt change in atmosphere.
Are Julia and Kimi dating? That picture looks like a couple picture and I am so confused because I thought they were just roommates?
Not only toast is the great detective, he’s a good actor too. I completely bought into him bullying and abusing people. Though probably tilted bottles helped with the energy
guess that Asian again
Chat should start submitting their fridges and we could have a regular rate my fridge from anyone series.
Was the 2nd one filipino or something? XD
celine with the JDB 🤤🤤
My mom raided my fridge because she wanted to see if I was eating healthy. Except, I live by myself & next to a grocery store, so I keep practically nothing in my fridge despite cooking. Had to convince her I didn’t have an eating disorder
least annoying duo on internet, toast and lily
They should do “guess / rate that car” from famous streamers
Is this video sponsored by liquid death?
The video "Guessing the fridges of famous Streamers" is a clever and entertaining take on the classic game of "What's in the Box?" This time, however, the focus is on guessing the contents of the refrigerators of popular streamers, providing a unique and amusing glimpse into their daily lives and habits.  The video highlights the fact that, as public figures, streamers often have their lives and habits scrutinized by their fans and followers. While this can be a source of pressure or discomfort for some, the video shows that it can also be an opportunity to connect with fans and share a more personal side of one's life.  Moreover, the video is a reminder of the diverse and sometimes surprising interests and habits of streamers, who may be known primarily for their gaming content but who also have rich and varied lives outside of the gaming world. From veganism to soda addiction, the video provides a fascinating window into the unique personalities and quirks of these popular streamers.  Overall, "Guessing the fridges of famous Streamers" is a fun and lighthearted video that highlights the creativity and ingenuity of content creators in the gaming world. By taking a fresh and unexpected approach to the classic game of "What's in the Box?", the video provides a unique and amusing glimpse into the lives of some of the most popular streamers on the platform, and reminds us of the diversity and complexity of the gaming community as a whole.
Camera film has a limited shelf life. It will keep longer in the fridge. Just let it warm to room temperature before using it.
me white af, with a huge jar of kimchi in my fridge...
They needed a list of the people who submitted lol
the webcam is such potato quality lmfao
we need to continue this as series cuz man this is entertaining lmao XD
I've waited for toast fridge to appear. 😂
Thumbnail is so funny 😂
I keep my apple juice in the refrigerator because I like to drink it cold😭
#9 and #14 physically pained me just by looking at the fridges. Like this if you agree
Wine? Looks like sparkling wine bottles with an almost drank OJ next to it? Somebody’s been drinking mamosas.
How would that be Yvonne’s when there’s no mustard, unless u reason that Yvonne would never refrigerate mustard, because it would be gone in the first sitting?
toast and lilly never miss when they do a video together .. pure content the whole time. why am i laughing looking at random peoples fridges lol .. toast kills me with his older brother sibling energy its hilarious
Was this sponsored by coke zero and ninja melk?
Do a guess that Valo streamer by their drawing of their main.
MOREE PLEASE!!
14:50 Rating associates fridges!!!
😂😂😂 You 2 made this vid hilarious.
more amongus pls
cool video bros
Is that fire emblem music I hear
I’m gonna need another fridge video, a pantry video, a bathroom video
Do you guys remember when Toast wasn't cringe as fuck? I miss fat toast
Honestly.
Toast and lily doing anything is entertaining
13:19 Wait, how old are these people? They look like teenagers, lol. Shame on OTV for using child labor! ;P
Wonderful concept. Love it. Would not mind more of this. Though, as someone who loves cooking, I'm a little bit saddened by the lack of actual ingredients in the fridges. But it makes sense if everyone prefers ordering in.
LMAO toast vs Lily energy is amazing
“This persons Asian for sure” Do you know how little that narrows it down?
Toast and Lily are to young to know about camera films. You always keep them cold before you send them away.
toast grasping lily's shirt to scold her LOL
Ah yes....Cling Flim.
I miss this interactionsss so glad you guys back to one place :)
Hah, disguised toast
"I can't believe the fridge with Newts hot sauce was Newts fridge, that's crazy" yeah insane, I was gonna guess Joe Biden.
Is toast brother of lily?
bro atsu's fridge scares me genuinely
The only mistake in this video is that Toast not reminding Lily of his 5.7% heritage. 😆
I dont know how...but I guessed Atsu's one right lmfaoooo
I like how Charlie is the only white person featured... and he has the ultimate white person fridge.
,,his job is taking pictures of food,, 4:31 Picture of a puppy in the middle,hmm
I don't know if they are sponsored or not: but always keep on mind that for aluminium-recycling to be "better for the environment" a couple of points have to be met: - People (you) actually seperating the aluminum from the other trash - There needs to be a consantly running, efficient pipeline _nearby_  So yeah, if you do not have both conditions met, please avoid aluminum cans (if you intend to do something for the environment)
Toast! a certain game needs your Harem powers try playing Warlander with the gang. please. we neeeeeed you!
lmaoooo my fridge would really be so chaotic for this
I was really hoping to see xqc's fridge lol
Aint no way lily said 99 ranch
Guess that Asian but only using fridge photos
where's toast's fridge?
LMAO!
Toast = Person who can make content out of anything 👍👍
when Lily realizes that she has screwed up the game at 13:20 is hilarious and I have watched her reaction so many times now.
Any Toast video with Lily will be quality chaotic content
Do more pls
Looking at an open fridge for an extended amount of time makes me want to close it.
Sometimes I get two of juice, lemonade, ect, so I can have one later because of knowing I'm going to have one now.
Toast threatening Lily somehow makes every video 100x better 😆
Is this good content?
just exposed atsu’s weebiness level: its so high that theres a dio in his fridge
I love this video idea xD
I enjoyed that
famous streamers... has timmy in the thumbnail lmao
Really feel like I got clickbaited by the "Famous streamers" in the title.
Ah, Toast... You are the gold standard for pretentious.
16:23 Lmao 😂
#11 looks like my fridge
Imagine making thousands of dollars by looking at and rating fridges o.O Toast living the dream
Damn toast makes some cool videos
For the next episode id suggest to just rate..anything..from anyone..ever :D
HAHAHAHAHAHA WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE
How do you guys stay entertaining constantly. Like they’re just constantly talking how? They’re actually really skilled and it’s just so natural
Show your fridge
looking forward to RAEfridgerator rofl
Jummy's fridge screams Filipino. My fridge looks exactly like that, bunch of glass containers,  bowls of dishes that is covered by a plastic so that I can re-heat it later for the next 3-4 days. My freezer is full of frozen goods such as Fish, Meat, ice creams and ice packs.
toast is low key dumb
Y'all real starved for content out here
Can we have another episode with your more known friends? XD So we can play along too? Plsssssss Thus was hilarious tho lol
what's wrong with having beer? beer is great
Batteries in the fridge??? Lol
Yvonne's fridge is all mustard bottles
I know this video is fake because streamers do not cook
TOAST I'm watching your videos with VPN so that I can get ads. I will love to see more about DSG
Anyone who hasn't seen paymoneywubby do viewer's fridges do it lol
Im watching this while queueing in League and im done watching and im still queueing
14:35 literal celebrity millionaire, primary diet is kimchi and instant noodles.
Has Lilly always been this cute?…..
cant wait for the next episode
Spot the kimchi sounds hilarious
BOBS fridge!
"we just have to whittle down the korean people right"  chill with the genocide lily
15:22 "you want an eggxplanation?"  I see and heard what you did there.
Moist would premake a bunch of food
I agree with Toast’s statement on the Apple Juice 😂🍎. Once I buy it, I know it’ll be gone before the week ends. 5:28
i need more of these guessing the fridgess
More lily and toast content!! Sibling energy so great 💯
Mooooore
4:24 the viewers
GREATEST SHOW EVER!!!
The vibes were right in this one
hi
btw that wasn't wine it was sparkling cider
376,825 views, 24k likes, 512 comments, 3.78M subscribers, #44 On Trending. Nice!!
This is how toast gets his DSG money. More fridge content woo
1:50 Duracell inside the fridge. 😆
I had a good laugh watching this and guessing with them!!!  I always love watching their chaotic sibling energy 😂  I hope there'll be more "Guessing the _____ of people/streamers" videos 😻 to come!!
I’m not even surprised Atsu fridge looks like that 💀
Did u start an en sports
16:18 toast is so ruthless LMAOOO "as you should!"
i have never been more invested in other peoples fridges just right now
I need a toast X Tuonto X Jake interaction
Guys sub so toast can pay the valorant team salary
This is gold lol
14 came up and I knew the owner of that fridge was white. Lol
Great chemistry between these two! 🥰
This thumbnail does not do the video justice! Very funny
honestly i love Toast's video ideas
this is really a banger
Michael: *_SPAM MUSUBI_*
The editing looks so effortless, it's almost hard to notice how much work went into it
Toast asking "what's the scope?" kills me
toast is doin a lil too much here, anyone feel that. like w lily and michael together and everything...
*has unopened mango juice in my fridge rn*
I loved this video!!! Really creative
toasts point about the apple juice is fact
Lily and Toast are such a good combo, almost as good as Michael and Lily
12:49 nice Imperial march!!
always wanted to eat a coyote.
"Oh, they're rating fridges, this looks wholesome" Toast: "First, is this a korean person?" 👀👀👀👀
Honestly i'd watch a series of this with just random fridges, it's really fascinating to me lol
toast is like the devil on your sholder that says you should flush your grandpas meds down the toilet while lilly is the angel who keeps going on about that dog you didnt save 10 years ago
Go back to among Us nerd!             Please.... Im addicted to your among Us videos and im as smart as you.
I have at least 6 bottles of apple juice at home and drink them over several weeks...
sad there wasn't any RAEfrigerator photos there :((
Poor daniel
Celine >>>>>
Apparently even Youtubers can get clickbaited too like how Toast got got by Lilypichu's slides
whats atsu doing here LOL
Toast and Lily’s chemistry is out of this world. Just pure wholesome content.
Bob’s fridge
Toast and Lily content specially the guessing content always makes my day.
Lowkey giving their friends a shout out haha
6:24 Overcooked OST - Restaurant
11:53 "You were expecting food, but it was me, Dio!"
When they guessed roomies fridge, they mentioned everyone except one loool
Damn lily and toast has that sibling relationship
Do you think they cleaned up their fridges before hand 🤣
11:58 that Dio figurine got me crying lmfao
You're supposed to put film in the fridge if you're not going to use it for a while
I would continue watching this series of you guys judging fridges of people you’ve interacted with before 😂
my fridge is never as full as these lmao.
The brother sister anger is my favorite
Loved the episode of rate anyone's fridge. Can't wait for next week's ep! 😹
im with celine i dont drink apple juice right away
The moment I saw the Jollibee and the Duracell on the top shelf, I immediately went to the "Oh it's probably someone whose Filipino" and there's only two people in the OTV and Friends circle that's Filipino. Michael and Jummy but then Lily said that Michael's fridge isn't like that so it has to be Jummy. And I was right.
These guys must not be wine drinkers. That bottle of Caymus in Celines fridge is like $100.
Whats next? Shoe rack?
Pasta doesn't have milk in it...
10:57
asmongold.... only drpepper
12:36 - 12:52 Me: *YES*
10:41  what the fuck? Preboiled eggs? Those are in like proper grocery store packaging.
nice.
Love the concept "Quess the race base on there fridge" :'D
😆
You should just tweet him pictured of your fridges for the next episode of "random fridges of random people". Maybe they can just guess if the person is famous or not
lily and toast interaction video will be my forever favorite
Really made me want to buy Kimchi plus ''How did we get his fridge?'' I love that phrase.
11:52 🙂
6:01 The whole idea was that if you go to a party or out to drink with friends you could drink water without feeling pressured to drink or out of place.
I just want kimchi now
Ayyy a Collab vid after so long!!
I don't know why but looking at pictures of open fridges gives me the same anxiety as leaving my fridge open for too long (and it'll beep angy)
Lily and Toast in a video is always entertaining!
those are just ur friends..idk any of these ppl
Toast and Lily are the darkhorse dynamic of OTV. They're always entertaining.
I guessed Janet's correctly!
as it turns out, this title was clickbait.
who the heck puts Duracell in the fridge!
The real reason to become a famous streamer is so that Toast and Lily rate your fridge.
surprised this video took so long to upload
Yaaaay more funny content with Lily
RefrigeRaters
;0
I suddenly rememberrd the game of "Guess the Asian", 😂😂 I hope there's part 2
I thought everyone puts cling film over bowls/ plates in their fridge?😅
Most annoying voice I ever heard. no offense
this is S tier content
DSG!!!!!!!!!!!
people who dont individually wrap pizza slices when putting it away and just shove the box in the fridge... thats just wild
That was enjoyable~! Now another petition for another episode of guess that asian!!
I genuinely would want a fridge like wendy's and abe's. I feel like I would still survive in an apocalypse with that stock of food lol
Watching this brings back memories of WoWcrendor raiding fridges.
it staggers me how few of their friends actually cook...
5:35 Toast... you know you can buy more than one apple juice right?
Y’all should do pantry next
Damm now I want another episode of "Guess that Asian" lmao
I really didn't expect Atsu's fridge to be there XD the Jojo makes so much sense now...IN A FRIDGE!!!
goated content
excited for the next installment of rating fridges from anyone! =D
Great job Daniel, you throw that curveball and watch them struggle for our amusement! Made the video much more entertaining.
great Content more money for DSG wohooo
honestly reviewing viewer fridges could be funny
This is the GeoGuesser of household essentials
#7 had kimchi, they missed it in the video, it’s the green lid behind the milk
The raid the fridge idea is meh in my opinion but the interaction between the two was genius. They could be doing almost anything and I would enjoy watching.
when Toast is so smart and tired to solve mysteries out of very little things. I mean who guess streamers out of that.
In the back of my mind all this time was "Stop talking Close the Fridge!!!" :p
Toast is funny. Im sorry.🤣🤣🤣
can't wait for the next fridges
Lily and Toast always a good combo. XD
I’m not Asian but we have like three jars of kimchi😅
Yay! Random fridges!
need more
toast getting reeal touchy
My favorite part was Lily not letting Toast get away with the Charlie thing
YESS THE OTV HOUSE DOING STREAMS TOGETHER 💞. also toast is right about the apple juice 🤣 and give toast his pasta! 😂😂😂
Shout out to the non-azn people out there that keep Korean, Japanese, Chinese, etc., staple ingredients in their fridge because they went wild at their local azn market and fell in love with the food ❤
Pasta isn’t dairy, it’s a grain
This was funny to watch live. Especially when Toast decided to redo the intro a few times because as he was going through them the theme kept changing.
I have another idea- rating pantries of lily's friends
The most shocking thing about this video is the way toast says pollo loco. Good video
Well. Better than the bobba shop thing
fuck this video was so simple but ridiculously good
Her poor shoulder
Fridges !!!!
This is so much fun. Love the guessing/rating/looking at the fridges of Famous Streamers/Friends/Crew/Anyone/Youtubers
Toast + Lily = Pure content 😂🔥🔥
Yvonne wouldn't put her favorite mayo that high, come on
More rating of people’s fridges please 😂
Jollibee!
This is so scuffed 🤣
Toast’s apple juice rant is spot on. You don’t leave apple juice unopened for long. I rarely have unopened apple juice in my fridge yet I don’t always drink it. It’s a niche taste that comes along and demands to be satiated immediately. You buy it, bring it home, and you crack it open to take a sip before you put it away.
Coke Zero is so good
Toast, you're rich. Buy yourself a car would ya
Tost whw did you make a click bate video there are almost no famous streamers
Yes please 'spot the kimchi'!
this content is one of the most entertaining i've seen in a while. Hope this becomes a series, idea is actually cool!
Great vid!
Plz put some more video toast n offline TV😔
*patrick voice* WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE
I do have to agree w toast on this one… I was trying to guess along and then someone would pop up I’ve never heard of 😭😭
6:24 is that Caymus cab sauv in the fridge? That's like an $80 bottle of red wine that should absolutely not be served cold.
Do they not live together anymore?
These slide show/game show videos are a personal favourite of mine. The threats and giggles go nicely together
1:48 real voice?
Oh it’s on main channel?? I thought this vod gonna ed up in disguised toast 2 😂😂
Me a white person spotting the kimchi in my own fridge because my dad loves it 🤣🤣
Why is this video actually such a banger? 😂
This was actually really entertaining. Well done
everyone buys the same fridge model??
WHAT’S THE SCOPE
You guys are just being rude. Why are pointing people when clearly your employee asked them for the pictures of the fridge.
I'm not Korean but I do have kimchi
i love toast humor sense, cynical yet so funny 🤣
I need to see more fridges thnx
What is the Scope.....Print that on T-shirts immediately with a silhouette of toast grabbing lily's shoulder
wow toast getting jebaited and then threatening lily is the funniest part of all this
did they stream this??? anyone has a link to vod??
at this point maybe I can submit my fridge
If you need more content I can submit pictures of my fridge
if he wasnt so mean on stream (ik theyre joking but man..) I would love to see more!
I can’t 😂😂😂😂
They have such funny chemistry. Toast's sense of humor is underrated.
i love this
Danny screwed up. Toast is disappointed.
Yo thumbnail change
Lily + Toast is pure content gold.
My Dad, who is from Ireland, eats more Kimchi then I have ever known
still need a lot of episodes 2 of other series
I actually really enjoyed this.
Please more content but on other people's stream lmaooo.
Whenever toast & lily make a video together it's so funny... We need this kind of content everyday
Idk why but hearing toast saying Korean is so addicted :D 6:52
Lily and toast are so funny together. I LOVE IT!!
YOO Atsu in Toast's vid and it's something Toast malded at Lily? a win in my book lmao.
Toast and Lily are genuinely my favourite friendship or duo to watch lmao the chaotic and sibling-like energy is unmatched. I hope this becomes a series of "Toast and Lily judge cars/closets/etc"
frudge
I wanna see "spot the kimchi" next!
This sould have been a "Guessing fridges of OTV FRIENDS"
After buying my house I bought two fridges, one for the kitchen and one in my office, mainly for my drinks and junk foods..(I got a smaller copy of my kitchen fridge because it was cheaper than a large mini-fridge)
Hearing toast call Yerba Mate 🧉 correctly was *chefs kiss* 😭😭🤍🤍
Nutritionist here to clarify that Ensure is not to help you poop.. it’s a nutritional drink usually used to help increase calories, and the ones in this video are essentially just protein shakes 😂
I would be so disappointed if I cracked open a can and it's  water.
This was way better than it would have been if it was just streamer's fridges. 1. It's basically impossible to guess. 2. The scope can't getting change. 3. Toast's frustration and Lily's defensiveness. A+
Great am I suppose to know staff, and lily's seasonal friends.
I remember this live. It was even more hilarious
Jummy suffers from saving his batteries in the fridge for later
I missed this so much, the Lily and Toast duo is so funny. Now that they are in living in the same house again hopefully there will more of this. More random hoping in each other's stream
cant believe toast is talking so highly of his rival, Moist Critikal.
Ngl, I was expecting "famous streamers" lmao. I gave up guessing after the first ones. Still funny and entertaining video tho.
damn dsg got content pumped
more fridges! 🙌🙌
I want more of this😂
this was actually so entertaining which is wild
toast needs to invite RAEfrigerator next time
I like to see Toast critique the specs of the fridges and max-min the configurations. Hilarious collaboration, please keep the series going!
You two should guess pantries next.
Sibling energy where Toast just can't stop bullying Lily.
The way this video was going, if my fridge appeared, I wouldn't be surprised.
Lol I watched it on Wendy’s stream 😂 She did better lolol
Is this normal fridge for an average american .... my fridge has very little takeout food and juices. I mostly have asian sauces, and mostly veg milk and cheese
Daniel should've added Rae's costume fridge lmaoo
this is so funny
This is awesome!!
all your friends are asian.
ill submit my fridge 😂
This has inspired me to clean our fridge
WE NEED MORE OF THIS, PART 2 PLS
Hey toast you should do a collab with teo and do a teodle it’s fun and you’d enjoy it he would hopefully get more subs.
Loved It! 11/10 Comedy Gold
Can't wait for episode 2!!
Waiting for next week
this is great. always love to see toast verbally abuse lily
When I see a water pitcher in the fridge, I know for sure they are Korean
my man rly called pasta dairy
How did I miss this streammm?!? Great content as always 10/10
this is actually a good idea for a series lmao
I cared that they weren't famous
ensure is a liquid meal replacement, not something that helps u poop. it's bloody expensive too
Cool to see you using Ludwig and criticals no copyright music!
"I WANT PASTA" literally dead
Ngl would like to see this as a series
WHAT IS THE SCOPE LILY?
Celineis Misato isnt she?
Newt gave everyone hot sauce and now we have proof that nobody kept it. RIP.
rating streamers to rating friends to rating anyone HAHAHAHAH
more Lily x Toast content please!! Here is my comment to boost your video. As return I want more !!
Seeing atsu's fridge is the indirect genshin crossover I was not expecting.
Please rate Mexican fridges please lmao
This is SOOO Good Toast. Your dynamic is amazing! :)
Hi
This title is misleading!
I've always wondered how close Charlie is to the otv and friends group, the end basically confirms what I thought - they aren't that close, which is a shame cause I love when they interact.
Fun video
as a florida man myself Moist’s fridge is very florida coded
If the first one was yvonne wheres the mustard?
Not me looking for jummychu's comment
Can't wait for more Rate That Refrigerator ft. Our friends (who aren't famous streamers)!
Good to see you doing more stuff with your friends!
toast said polo loco and i died
I watched this video, opened my fridge and couldn't see where one shelf started and the other ended. How do these people do it lol
FINALLYYYYYYY
Toast finally putting that 10,000 IQ to the test
toast and lily collabs are always good.
who the f are those people? 👎
"you're just lucky to be here" damn toast
i love toast roasting lily making her a better youtuber and fixing her scopes because this was too big of a scopes
that was so fun to watch and banger content all around!!!! I loved my stay :)
pole o loco 💀💀 its pronounced poyo loco
its nice to have a casual video
New title: lily and toast look at fridges
Kimchi brand recommendations?
4:46 12:34 13:29
20 minutes of toast suffering from being bad at something
the scope was supposed to be famous streamers fridge.... poor toast he didn't expect that the scope would be so wide 😆😆😆😆
This video suddenly became" what your fridge tells about your personality?".. 😂😂
Can't wait for the next episode!
Whatever template you can convince yourself to be enthusiastic over, I will watch <3   Next time: Toast and Lily rate car insurance choices of their closest friends
we know we are not toasts friends
LMAO Toast and Lily duo is always crack!  laugh so hard!
No way!!! Because I thought that one fridge was the roomies for sure
lol do americans not cook?
banger, honestly
They didn't mention the braggs apple cider vinegar. I don't know if it helps, but that's mega healthy shit right there.
This stream was so good lol
Big brother toaust vibes are so good
Toast lily content is Goated!!!
great content.  would love to see p2 where it's actually famous people so we can see their fridges and actually play along/know who it is =)
This is the best video posted on this channel in a long time
They should have had the names at least so it wasn’t literally impossible with their friend group size
Lily and toast our just entertainment gold when they are together. They should do more content together and make them YouTube dollars
makes me uncomfortable when people grab me or touch me while talking to me even in a joking way.. and looking at people do that is also weird like.. i get it if you do it once in a while for dramatic effect, but.. every time? that's borderline socially inept behavior lmao
Please open this to viewer submissions
You be speaking facts about the apple juice
we need more fridges
i love this 2 always great content 😂
let me show my fridge
I love this episode.
Thank you, Daniel. The scope was just right.
Where's michaels fridge?
Film in the fridge makes it age slower
"Is this our fridge?" Imagine not knowing every inch of your own fridge !
ofc it was atsu LOLL
Toast outsourcing to Lily outsourcing to Daniel for Toast's video is the perfect setup to hijinks
the absolute best video disguised toast has ever put out  10/10 expect more fridge content in the future
Toast malding in real life just hits diff
Atsu's fridge is scary... *judging look*
Actually love to see Lily and Toast together it’s so fun
lol toast went full dad in this video and he has a favorite child :p
I loved this episode of "Looking at random refrigerators from anyone... anyone.. every... and sometimes we rate them when we do not forget"
LMAO... Loved the video... Dream team, I hope to see much more like this, from the new house.
Just ask her out already dude. Michael I'd younger and unmature to her.  It's pretty obvious lol. Getting old, just go for it.
I could live in Wendy and Abe's fridge fr
thats a fact about apple juice
We're totally not out of ideas right?
"Is this our fridge?" Imagine not knowing every inch of your own fridge !
I feel like more often than not it would be a korean fridge... or have at least 1 korean accessing it.
That title changes though... 😭🤣
The video devolving into find the kimchi is so funny 😂
i think we would enjoy watching these 2 do almost anything
This is ACTUALLY a banger video. Great content.
Lily and disguised toast energy is just too funny when they make a video together 🤣🤣
Fridge 2 is definitely Filipino 'cause they have Star Margarine.
Toast hijacking lily for streams is my favourite genre of content.
I love this video because now I know what to get for next groceries
The logical next step is "Guess the Asian (Based on their Fridge)"
Going back to the start to complain about the scope of fridges repeatedly is so funny! I love the Toast Lily videos, the sibling energy is so strong.
10000000000% keep an eye out for coyotes, especially with small dogs. My Mother's dog got attacked by a pack of coyotes and he had to be put down since there was no way to save him. It could have been prevented if my mother used a leash and walked the dog rather than let him run off on his own. It was a very sad day, and it was frustrating because it could have been easily avoided.
who tf puts batteries in a fridge
toast speaking korean HAHA
instead of guessing whose fridge it is u should just have subscribers send in their fridges for you to rate/roast
The collaboration we all want, Toast and Charlie
1.337M off a fresh post. That's what we're going with huh? Awesome video-ception edit though.
Wow, people actually have things in their fridge 😭
Since you were "looking at random refrigerators from anyone....... anyone...... ever" would you like to look at my refrigerator?
the retitling not once, but twice 😭
100% agree about the apple juice.
Is Toast from North Korea?
the shirt pull is such a classic sibling vs sibling vibe
ITS POLLO LOCO NOT POLO LOCO
Next week shirley
That was hilarious, I'm glad the "scope" kept broadening bc it made for a funny reaction
Still the best duo !
This is really interesting, I like these videos
I feel like Daniel is just flexing his networking at this point...
I saw jollibee. I knew it's jummy
The amount of Coke Zero Sugar in these fridges is insane.
great fridge-guessing, toast and lily!
Ngl, when I saw the fridge with Dio on it, I thought it was CDawgVA's 😅😅😅
I'm Korean and I don't like Kimchee I feel like a fraud
CONTENT MACHINE 👌
I was only able to guess #7 because of the lao gan ma
Name a better duo ❤
Having the urge to DM toast a picture of my fridge...
Man i love this HAHAHAH, seingg atsu was a freaking surprise.
great content, cant wait for next week!
you thought there was Kimchi, but it was ME, DIO!
🖤
okay liquid death isnt just water that looks cool to be quirky lol its like the most sustainable way to consume sparkling water + has a very high nutritional value, has little to no processing, and is estimated to have a very low carbon footprint and a very low water footprint. and its made to not only look like beer but be carbonated like beer as well. 6:01
“What is the scope 😡” 😂😂
Gotta say, wasn't expecting atsu to show up here but I'm glad Toast considers him enough of a friend to include him 😂😂
damn I love "Lily and Toast look at fridges", hope this becomes a regular series!
time to try melo melo
i like how they always narrow down the results to asian, most pointless exercise loool
I didn’t know celine was a alcoholic
I love toast and Lily's dynamic
I am waiting for the spin-off guess the freezer
I think lily is forgetting that Toast is 5.7% Korean….
Toast threatening Lili'y life(rightfully so, WHAT IS THE SCOPE LILY??) is the funniest toast lilly interaction ever.
Nice idea
What did we learn: Lily befriends everyone.
LMAO I LOVE THIS VIDEO
can't wait for them to react to this video 😂
Funny video toast
I'm getting a weird sense of Déjà vu....
Lilly trying to defend celine is hilarious. Ketchup bottle is half full. OJ isnt even cracked open. Toast is 100% right here lol. she did not just go get groceries haha
The apple juice thing is so true :o
What's I laugh more is that the title didn't change (⁠≧⁠▽⁠≦⁠)
The 2nd intro was fantastic!
OTV staff got me lmao
Today's fact : if you fart in space the pressure could push you up
I'm simple - I see Lily in a Disgusted Toast video, I click. Their chaotic sibling energy is everything
Lily- "I said friends.. And Daniel's a friend 🌝" *Hand on heart*
Where is the sound at 1:23 from and why do I know it
NOT RELATED BUT DSG LETS GOOOOOOOOO
Melo melo, common name the Indian volute or bailer shell, is a very large edible sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusc in the family Volutidae, the volutes
WAKE UP DISGUISED TOAST POSTED
Ah yes our favorite chaotic siblings
