Absolutely great! Juv’ has real charisma.
I love how much fun Juvenile had at this concert! (he inspired my first ever comment on Youtube) ❤‍🔥
Next is an orchestra stage!
lake Charles Louisiana , blocked by Yung joc Robinson of Puerto Rico and de la ghetto wife Veronica heredia aka DC fly
see ya one day in Carson City Nevada and ginuwine concert and gray eyes r. Kelly
No tiny desk made me laugh, groove and smile from ear to ear like this one. Juv got all the sauce!!
My Big Homies
Back watching again. Juvi 🔥💙
Man them girls can sing.........
This was beautiful 💕 love my people!
This has become my lullaby. My favorite tiny desk!
We'd love to hear a new album by Juve produced by Mannie. Yall still relevant bro especially after the verzuz.
Still got it bro
Killed every track 🔥🔥🔥🔥
That Juve Juice looks like its definitly worth a try 🍺
Taylor swift didn’t get asked for an encore 😂
Loseing Myyy Touch Time 2 Call Jenneeeeeee😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
masterpiece ✨
Mannie CARRIED.  DID AND DOES.  I just went back-- that man be supportive af
Buy nothing this year
Who's here AGAIN in November 2025?
@9:25 guy is so tall his head is cut out the frame dammm ma boi
Mannie and Juvie are those uncles that you cant wait to pull up at the family bbq because you know they are the life of the party.
I need this on vinyl 😅
One of the best Tiny desk I seen!!  Juvie the great!!!!
20:05
2025 🔥🔥🔥
I watch this every couple of months. This is still hands down my favorite live performance to watch.
This was epic! I've loved Cash Money music since I was a teen. I've never seen a Tiny Desk performance like this. Well done Juve, Fresh and all of the amazing musicians!
"not today juvenile"
🔥🔥🔥
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
I wish I could find a way to explain to everyone i know that this is truly the pinnacle of Tiny Desk concerts.
🥰
😂🔥 that horn section 🔥🎺🎷
Bruh the energy is unmatched!
Man juvie look like he having the time of his life!
That bass ❤
Mfr,,that Manny really real DJ, Jsn
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This will always slap
born and raised in the 504 and Mannie was always the heart and soul of Cash Money...once was walking into Macy's at Lakeside Mall, held the door for the people behind me and was shocked when I turned around and saw it was Mannie and Birdman...said what's up and went about my business...was shopping for some fresh timbs and a few other things...walked back out of Macy's and Mannie, Birdman, Wayne and a bunch of their crew were standing around chilling...Mannie saw me and took a minute to ask what I had in the bag and just showed a little love...I'll never forget that!
If Manny was still running Cash Money they would still be relevant and Wayne would still be making music. Manny is a true musician. Birdman is a talentless hack
Skringz
400 DEGREES STILL HITTIN IN THE CLUB AND WE IN 2025
🔥🔥🔥🔥
i never knew manny did all those add libs i love this
Authentication. Universal law.
Project chick!!!

This tiny desk better then the verzuz they just did with no limit
Whooooaaaaaa 🔥🔥🔥🔥
21:59  Jon Batiste couldn’t believe his ears 😂  “run it in the hole yeah?”
This is awesome!
From NYC 🫡 ❤
Juvenile 💐
Definitely one of my favorite NPR concerts
2025 these are our living legends
NPR just lost my donation. 🤦🏼‍♂️
I wish I can like this video 100 times.
This is so good
mannie loves 400 degreez so he can play with the robot voice 🤖that’s my fav song too
The best it ever did it❤
Who here are No Limit Verzus Ca$h Money?
So good to see Mannie fresh truly enjoying his creations
🔥🔥🔥🔥
This brings back memories to when hiphop was culture. You had to be talented to be in the game. That's why artistes like Juvenile's hits will live on forget compared to the overnight jingles they're doing now.
Me after the verrrzzzuuuzzz !! ❤😂
10:12 This acoustic version sounds so nostalgic ❤ ahh life back them was all fun and innocence
I didn't realize I knew a few of his songs 😂
This says alot because this is sow out of character for what tiny Desk is known for.
The way I was vibing at work!!!! Mannnn what a time to be alive
Who’s here after the VERZUZ??👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Juvenile is cold❤
Mannie fresh be jamming with that bounce he be doing since the 90'S...🔥
Yesssss
Top 5 tiny desk
The Live Band elevates the entire sound.. I love NOLA!!!
So greasy but I love it
Who’s here after VS? No limit def need one 🔥🔥🔥
WHO CAME RIGHT AFTA THE VERZUZ😅🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🤯🤯🤯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

I smiled the entire time!!
At least give Turk tha Tiny desk concert!

The best & I mean the best tiny desk ever ❤ This two entertained & that 1 more time hit ever harder❤❤ respect❤🙌
I love when Manny went out with the audience 😍🥰
Mannyyyyyyy 😍

Juvie had the best tiny desk concert!!!
why havent I ever seen this this is dope
Favorite tiny desk ever. So nostalgic. 🫡 Juvi
Has there ever been an encore request on the tiny table before?!
26:04  The audience too composed. I would’ve made them confused by where the show was DYHM??
The actual encore, touched my heart.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Tiny desk is officially 400 Degrees!
When both worlds 🌎 collaborate
This video is lexapro ❤
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Happy memories.
Juve makes dirty sound romantic. Baby making music... And you want to party afterwards.

Back for more in Oct 2025 ❤
This is why I love rap, it’s so versatile.
20:05 for future me 🤍
This is the best one
Diff one of the best top 2 no doubt... I've always like juvenile but seeing this they personalities is in point love it
I still bump this, till this day…. I wish I was there
Ladies and gentleman, from the front to the back we have musicians. HEART EYES BECAUSE HOLY FACHFJGJ
I can’t believe he did it again. I LOVE THAT
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ THIS MUSIC raised me
Wow!, brought back some serious memories from my gang bangin days. Madd respect to the O.G. Juvi!!!!
I just know they have the best time when they drinkin
I was thinking “Who the background singers” then the camera panned to the audience and THE AUDIENCE WERE THE BACKGROUND SINGERS
Who T/F shaved off Mannys Eye Brows?
Manniefresh the beat maker, scotts storch, timbo
glad to see manny and juvie are still unstoppable
Most folks respect it, but I will also say it.... Juve is a born entertainer.  Brodie enjoyed this and made sure everyone else did as well.
I ain't never felt the heat about them Girbaud jeans until now 😂
Still here listening in the year of 2025... October ❤
LET ME GET THAT TSHIRT I CAN FIT IT ! I SAY MY SISTER LOVE YOU !!!

The best Tiny desk concert across any genre of music. Juvenile smashed it.
This will never be topped and commenting from 10/25. Juvi the great.
CHEA CHEA
This is probably my favorite tiny desk of all time! I've watched this no less than 100x since it aired and it still hits HARD 🔥🔥🔥 Love me some dirty Southern rap ❤❤❤❤❤ The sounds of my youth still reign supreme! 😅
The second time was even better with the crowd going. Awwome.
Juve's delivery is like a wine. As time goes by is getting better 🔥🔥🔥
The only tiny desk I’ve come back to at least 50 times
🔥🔥🔥
🇨🇱
Here in 2025

Golden eyes and golden teeth.

That was a fun ride ..1 of the best all around Tiny Desk bits I've seen 👍
I’m at work smiling like emf so nostalgic
Luv4 Mannie Fresh 👍👊

Remember when this sellout puppet pushed the clot shot during the Covid hoax?  Kick rocks juvenile.
Juvenile and Mannie Fresh the best

They should play this on a loop at Pappadeaux on Sundays.
I just heard them on big boy interview I am addicted 😊😅😮😢🎉😂❤ love juniville voice turn on he stand on business facts
Trandon this music. Your music. Is beautiful! I’m so happy to find it again!! I had two dreams in life… music or raise a family. I honestly picked what dream came first! I picked being a father over music. But I still remember the family you let me be apart of and am sorry I don’t know you and Jerry’s kids. All that said. I’m so happy to hear your voice.
When hip hop had actual story tellers❤❤❤❤❤❤
20:04 greatest love song... backing right back up at you

After an annoying day this was necessary!! Always coming back here!
Louisana and rap from the south is another animal
❤🔥❣️🔥❣️🔥❣️From this 7th Ward Hard Head DC36
It's the fact that the band looks like they all are having a good time. Showing all their teeth smiling and laughing. I love it!

Few rappers can perform this well anywhere.  Mad respect to Juvenile. The band is cold AF too!
Magnolia is dangerous, I respect these men.
Sound like bouncey. ..❤
Still most shocking intro track / vibe shift in live music history
Manny looking not so fresh
Vencedor ❤
Definitely one of the best performances I’ve seen. Never heard Juvi sound soo good.  🫡
This went so beyond my expectations omg
❤❤❤❤❤
Manny Fresh always made ya dance
And to think juve didn’t want to do it first because he didn’t think he would sound good in this setting   Good thing he changed his mind
i listen to this entire thing frequently. incredible.
One of the best TD of ALL TIME❤!!!!!
The best performance thus far...
❤❤❤❤
It's hard to explain what I'm seeing here. But I love it and will keep watching this several times over... Very nostalgic Love it
Juvi gone always be hard
vax that thang up Juvie!  Hahaha!!👎🏾
I SO LOVE being from the south!
I think this guy's have hugh blindness. Lol. He's trying to be hard core military with a shower cap.That's not good for a grand uncle of rap. Never catch me do that. Because i'm independent rap and they can't match that. 😅😅😅
This one is a TOP 5 npr that was ever made. Thank you!
Mannn!!! I want to be in the crowd sooo bad!!
Jeezy needed this audience; this was a hot concert
20:04
The drummer, guitarist, and keyboardist. Bring nothing
I took a one way ticket str8 to the comment section, 🔥🔥🔥 lit!!
Cash money records and juvenile and manner fresh😊😊
Thank you, NOLA, for taking me into adulthood as a young lady.  This woman will ALWAYS LAUD that NOOOOOLA!❤❤❤❤❤

❤ Checking in to say I love you
Other than Mac, this is my favourite Tiny Desk
Need Curren$y on Tiny Desk !!!
This concert puts a smile on my face
Juvenile can rap love it and Minnie   Thank YOU GOD BLESS ❤❤❤❤❤❤
We need Big Tymers and Lil Wayne here.
We need mystikal on here
Scarface had one of the nicest set to 💯💯💯🤷🏿‍♂️
I love the amount of fun and awkwardness that is palpable in that room😂
This version of Rodeo elevates the song to a whole other level
This is a top 3 tiny desk, imo.
Juvenile sill a beast
You can tell the girl playing the violin is having flashbacks of dancing to the same song in the club.
Juvenile has always been my crush and one of my favorite artist. You and your crew did that! 💛💫
With the untimely demise of the Corporation for public broadcasting, can we agree that this was truly its finest hour?
🤎🤎🤎🤎🤎🤎🤎🤎🤎
Luv in the air
In the car 🎷
Ghandi off the chain ♠️
So crazy that a lot of hip-hop shows sound better live than a lot of these bands &/or singers do live 😂 but hey... I'm not surprised 😂✨ 🙌🏼✨
I watch this all the time.  Juvenile and Manny Fresh bring the best vibes.
This is DEFINITELY top 5 ! 😮‍💨🔥
Best Tiny Desk🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Years later still The Best!
People need to vibe better when they're blessed to be an audience to these performances
Best Tiny Desk EVER!!!!!!
❤❤
One of the best Tiny Desk
That 400 degrees 🔥
This the down south version of ol skoo hyphy. Crazy hype beat, erybody giggin, but he talkin crazy hood street shii. ❤️
Juvenile is so underrated in terms of shaping  modern  rap. Without his debut I don’t know if as many would have jumped at Wayne’s first album. He really gave cash money a boost off the rip.
New Orleans sure do know how to party  🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
A vibe for the unks
IS THE PIANIST SINGLE 😭😭
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I wish I had mannie fresh following me around just doing ad-libs and hyping me up all day...
🔥
“I need your energy!” NPR employees: 🤓🤓🤓
This is tough AF!!!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥
Wish they did my jam "Bounce Back"
I can't believe he did "Project Chick" with all the kids in the audience 😮
this entire session was awesome
2025❤❤❤
Juvie lol that's cold ........you chose all explicit sh$t  & All in the front row them  females all at the concert singing word for word. Ouchy. Emmy award for this show.
Please someone give Mannie his flowers 💐 while this man is alive because 😮‍💨this man is evolution!
Manny Fresh on Tha Talk Box is Diabolical
Barz
The way them white people got them instruments going is Krazy
SAVE PBS
🔥
Took me back in time.....I really enjoyed that 😊😊😊😊
I love you juvenile irreplaceable you❤❤❤❤❤❤
Ten Million!
🔥  juvie I shook your hand in 05-06 in South Korea and I’m doing it again now for u and Mannie fresh great performance brother 🤝
That Chile Flag On Back Go Nice With This Viva Chile Mierda!!
🔥
Mannie might look like Whoopi Goldberg but he still the goat
I love how much mannie love juvie bro
Snapped! ❤
Months later, still the best concert on Tiny Desk history
All I can say is wow that  very last performance was craaazy I enjoyed  seeing  juvi  and manning out with the crowd!!! Loved it! Here again in 2025
Juvie was PERFECT!!!

Good vibes all goosebumps ❤❤❤❤❤😊😊🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Im just seeing this in 2025❤❤ Well done Juvenile and Manny!❤
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This was an amazing watch. Very relaxing and chill
That encore was everything we needed.  I stood tf up and danced twice at 3am lol
Bomb ba bom bom rocky balboa!
The person that said “encore” needs a raise.
Who’s here in 2025?
If you were wondering what New Orleans sounds like
Best One Yet
So glad Mannie Fresh was here too. The legend behind the legend
“Sure, Mr. Juvey” 🥰
20:00
Legendary
Yessssssss!!!!!!
Juvie needs to be in a lot more convo
Still 🔥🔥🔥
Mannnnn 🔥
The audience had NO ENERGY Juve killed it
I feel like they told the horns not to go off! Still, Juvey got the BEST TINY DESK I’ve EVER seen!💯
Comforting ❤ 👋🏻 love this
Watched this so many times! Never gets old!! That NOLA flavor 😘
Juvie got me 'gain
Is that Jon Batiste on the keykazoo
This tiny desk put me in a whole cash money rabbit hole 😅
Back again 😂😂😂😂
Noun Theyyy Stole Myyy Onlyyy Yellow Sandles 😢😢😢😢😢
21:36 the stank face at that trombone lick 🤌
So good gotta do it twice 😂 👍
Men performing without women always been there like Suga T     Small wee wee mens aka tiny desk concert.    So the women of the bay. Should have their own concert   No balls will be juggled
Yeeeeeeeeee
The most Harmonius Elegantly Ratchet Beautiful Awesome Tiny Desk I have ever seen🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Bling bling🎉🎉🎉

The very best tiny desk I've ever seen. Totally killed it. Even more energy than Lizzo. 20+ year old classics and the crowd was jumping.
This was the best desk talk !!!!
🔥🔥🔥
I feel like OutKast might actually agree to do one of these...
Cash Money ain't dead!!!!!!
I watch this every chance I get 🎉❤😢😊🎉
Here after seeing the Ying Yang twins go viral at Seaworld. Get them in here!
It was the best tiny desk I have ever seen. I felt like I was participating/ partying in the streets of New Orleans . Love it.... ❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉❤
The CRUSH I had on Juvenile 🥰😛
the best!!
No more ads in the middle of a song, messed up the whole vibe.
Best Tiny Concert in my opinion.
The one on the left looks like she's related to Juvenile
Dude came to promote his brand; didn't skim on performance. nice
THE best
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Featuring:  Usman "Sojaboy" Umar from 90 Day Fiancé.
Entertainment during Covid Era was everything 😂
Dem Fns snapped
Born in 99 I remember listening to all these never knew the names just the lyrics😂😂😂💯

Jesus Christ
This is one of the best tiny desk concerts. Not even my favorite genre or artist to be on tiny desk, but this is what tiny desk is all about!
Juvi is really talented
Best TIny Desk Performance ever???
One of my all time favourites...
Fire no liar. Let’s go
Dudes good live
No way these folks knew they was making legendary hits that will never die
Mannie always having fun !
This is how Jeezy's Tiny Desk performance crowd should have been vibing with him.
Lemme see you work that!
I would buy this album with these songs and instrumentals in a hearbeat. I love this version.
Perfection! Everything about it. I just don't think there will ever be a Tiny Desk that compares.   Also, this needs to go on tour!
The cellist looked so out of his element but the violinist was vibin fr! I didn’t realize how much I missed hearing Juvenile!!! Aaaayyyee!! 🥰
Still watching this on 2025 and still to this day that rendition of rodeo is simply IMMACULATE
Back in 2025!
That was live af
⛽️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Manny Fresh was just the best producer and DJ back in the day. Still looks all smiles and healthy
Was in my high school when this dropped, now in my 30’s and it’s all nostalgic for me. Loved this camp: birdman and Lil Wayne
One of the Best Tiny Desk ever.
THIS IS PRICELESS!!!!
Dopest thing I have heard in a long time
This was really well put together
400 degrees
Juvenile   made cash money
304 likes yahahahahah
everyone is having so much fun got all races coming together music is so amazing
Here because I missed him at AFRAM 2025 and Artscape 2025, on two separate Saturdays.
I wish there was a camera on the crowd too
Look how he had no choice but too sang Wayne verse cause the song needed it
Pure TALENT and ENERGY
The most fire James Bond beats ever
0:48 Mannie got a Decepticon to pull up for the start of 400 degrees it sounds like its saying "Pull Up Hit The 3" im not sure exactly but that ish hits its always stuck with me first question im asking if i ever see a mf lol
✊🏾
Watched last year when it came out and loved it and was very pleasantly surprised!! Watching it again, June 2025 and enjoyed it again, just as much as before! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Fire juvenile killed this joint. One of the best yet

Hands down number one tdc
These cats are beasts in disguise.
Love it❤❤❤❤❤
Juve the great! Seriously this era of rap was the best!
I LOVE TINY DESK!!!!
This is cool to 12 year olds. These men can't play a lick of music and one talks fast while the other just goes "yeah yeah".
Fresh and Juvi NEVER MISS!!!
🔥🔥🔥
William Craig Campbell was off the chain 💙👠💙
Why they closed 'Freak nick'. 🎷
NWA was off the hook 🎷 peace
7:51 Slow Motion
Is that Nipsey Hustle on the keys?
love love love this it’s 7:15 am about to work thanks
Juvenile was definitely a goat!!! ❤ should've been up there with lil Wayne,  when it came to the $$$$ that's alright, baby boy, you're still the favorite in me and my son's life. I'm 63 years old. My son is now 33. We had the albums back when my son was eight years old do the math ❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉
Happy anniversary to this masterpiece of a tiny desk concert!
🔥
Should be titled Mannie Fresh Tiny Desk featuring Juvenile
Bobby Carter, Producer for NPR’s Tiny Desk DESERVES HIS FLOWERS TOO FOR THIS ONE DOOD
i had to listen to the intro to slow motion like 4 times, crowd JAMMIN'
Juvie the great wish he would of did ghetto children that's the song I based my whole life off
Juvy the Babyface following Sevenstreeter. In that MF order
Who’s here a year later? 🙌🏾👏🏾👏🏾
This took me back to my college days in the 90’s. 👏🏾👏🏾🙌🏾
I like hot Boyz n all them but jv was hella lit Mannie old as dirt! E40 was way better
Cherokee Indio  Fresno California
"Let me run it in ya' hole Ma" --Juvenile 2024. Tremendous contribution to art and society.  One comment called him a "virtuoso." lol.
🔥
Juvie need to come back and perform ghetto children first then the whole 400 degrees frfr ts would be live af live with all the instruments 💲🪖🔥🔥🔥🔥
This just showed me longevity is key 👣🪖💲🔐💎
20:07 The call to my People LOL.
They did it effortlessly
Ok the production of this one was TOP TIER!!! The flow of the songs, his commentary, bringing in the special guests.....this is what "oldies but goodies" should look like when we get a little older! Our era of rap done just like this!!! I wish whoever produced this one had done E-40s though. His was good but could have been bay better! He's from the way - they really could have done their big one!
Like wine 😍💯
I’m from 1999 200tthe best
Watch all of it but here is the reason I'm here  20:05
Mannnie fresh is a genius man!

"I WALK WITH A LIMP CUZ MY NUTS HEAVY" HEARRRRRRRRRRRRDDDDDDDDDDD
I LOVE JUVENILE THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
LIIIIT AF! Second best Tiny Desk
This was by far my favorite Tiny Desk. I’m singing every word to every song. Forgot how much I I knew and enjoyed his music. Juvi represented well with N.O artist Trombone Shorty and Jon Batiste was well played. Stand up N.O!!!

Best tiny desk of all time
In my life es lo mejor
That was too good
Don't ask if we're still here ... We never left ... 💗💗💗
EVERYBODY CHEESIN😁😁😁😁😁😁😁💃💃💃💃💃💃💃
Manny Fresh still just everything when it comes to being the man
Phenomenal ❤
No reason for it to be 10 ads in this video 😭
The live band just made all of Juvie’s song 🎶 hit different. I love it 20x more
Classically ratchet 😂😂😂
Please for the love of god someone help me with the song at 13:03
I come back to this tiny desk often to vibe
That was just what I needed at 6 am on MY BIRTHDAY! May 15th is starting out righteous!   "Who is you playin wit" 👍🏽❤️
First time I've seen an actual encore on one of these, Juvenile ❤️‍🔥
Greatest love song ever wrote!
Sax player looks like jidion
🔥🔥
Juve is the real reason my knees and hips hurt.
He licking nie 😂😂😂😂
My favorite tiny desk watching for the 100th time lol be back in 6 mos lol
This is epic lol
Rodeo definitely my fav song by him
I dont remember Mannie being so smooth in the mic
This tiny desk concert with juvenile is like when the lox killed dipset on stage and every other versus , hands down juvenile beats any one that did tiny desk and I'm Spanish so it's from a different angle but it's not facts but u can feel it how smoothly every lyric juvenile hit
I know that it's gotta be at least One maybe 2 PYT'S who's listening GO FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE KNOWING THAT THERE IM-PORTEN enough to be notice by women and men who flirts!!@we funny
We need juvenile at the next millennium tour, the way I just became a fan is crazy, this man is talented
Hands down one of the best tiny desk concerts
These days, not many can flow on point like that. Juvie is definitely one of the greatest live rap performers of all time.
Old school.
26:15.    Mannie a real one for that
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I’m watching from, Dallas, TX.
🗣️JUVI!!!!!!! ⚜️🤌🏾🏌🏾
Juve band thuggn with the fits 🔥🔥🔥✌🏿🎷🥁🎺
This is by far, the best Tiny Desk show! I'm a whodie from way back.
Mannie probably the coolest dude to hang around
This was one of the best tiny desk
Who's here for their weekly viewing of one of the best Tiny Desk concerts of all time? 👉🏾🤚🏾
Mannie Fresh is the best DJ..other than Jazzy Jeff
reminds me of some old 90's coffee shop shows.....so dope
Straight fire!!!
Top 3 Tiny Desk performances (IMO): Tie between Juvie and Scarface for first, and then The LOX!
7:52 This version of slow motion is so smooth.
What a great treat!!!❤❤❤😊
Is that John Batiste?
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Juvyyyyyy
This ish had my eyes welling up. Two greats Mannie Fresh and Juvenile. You had to be around at the time to understand the feeling.
KEEP IN MIND, MANNIE FRESH CREATED BOUNCE MUSIC! HE IS A LEGEND!
This makes me so proud to be from New Orleans. We have so much talent and most importantly we know how to have FUN!!! 🎉
I wouldve never in my life wouldve guessed a Trombone Shorty and Jean Baptiste Collab wit Juvenile. Pleasantly surprised
Bernice Nice Game Mercury Nice 2 Meet Uuu Mookey Taught Meee Nowell Mythology Heartbeats
Protect NPR at all costs….
I really enjoy these tiny desk sessions. There's nothing like live music. It would be really awesome to see some polynesian artists on this program.
GET IT WODIEEEEE
Ok!  ❤❤❤ 💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽
This set kept me positive and motivated for the 2 week icu vigil for my dad, and it's about to do it a second time for my kid's brain surgery this week.
Mannie Fresh is such a fun guy man. His enthusiasm is contagious. You can tell he's doing it for the love of the music.
My high school self is alive rn
I can't understand  how People  still sleeping  on the south just check out 2 of the best tiny concerts are July and face both from the south  bling bling
I think I’ve watched every tiny desk concert and this s the best. Mac Miller is awesome and so is Tedeschi Trucks.. but Juvenile is a bad man.
Outstanding 🎉😂
You gotta go to court ha?
The crowd is definitely over 30. Jamming know all the words and good vibes
Amé ❤
Now I wish we had a DMX tiny desk 💯
That was soooo good 😂
This was magic, I came back to make sure. It’s magic, no doubt 💎
23:47❤
If any artist can do classy and gangster at the same time it’s definitely Mannie and Juve🥰 that whole label was fire💯
Mr Fresh, can you please just produce all ur artists in aucoustic sets on your own please?  We want more!!
The first encore in tiny desk history
i really enjoyed the vibe of this Tiny Desk Concert, the energy was just right! however, i can't help but feel the production could've been a bit more polished. some parts felt a tad rough around the edges, but maybe that's just the charm of their style? would love to hear what others think!
Back in 2025!!’n
Wow this was so funkn fun to listen n watch!
The amount of times I’ve watched this is criminal
watching this with the closed caption on is freaking HILARIOUS.  The caption trying to catch up to the lyrics is the funniest thing ive seen in a while. Im gonna running this back until im old and gray lol. Set it off in this MFer!!!!
Yesssss 🙌🏾 I love Juvi he formed the best memories and days of my life ! I love him so much !
Here 2025 crying and smiling at the same time best ever 🥹😍
🔥🔥🔥🔥
I have ZERO interest in this, but I saw 10 MILLI views, so I clicked and....  stayed for the WHOLE thing. 😂
This. Is. Awesome.
BMF (Big Mannie Fresh) knew talent when he heard his voice.every song sounds like it would still be a major hit on 📻 which is rare..big Mannie fresh!! That's my DJ
I think this is my favorite tiny desk
I played Strings in elementary and loved it but Middle School didn't offer Strings, sad face. But I never lost the love for playing. The Springs brought back so so many great memories Thanks Juvy & Mannie!!! Boot City--Salute
I’m at work watching this on repeat at least (now) 15 times. I don’t even care for south music but this was everything!
Off tha chain till 3030
Should have been tha Superbowl halftime show..
🔥
Got me twerkin' at Work 😂
mannie at the end recognizing everyone knew every song and really loved them, turning his mic, jumping into the crowd, and performing with them. what a legend
Back again after cash money concert last night
This is legitimately one of the best live shows ever
Mannie fresh beats are unmatched
I’m having flashbacks
Juvenile has my Burberry polo on from the same time this album came out ahha
Saw a clip on IG. Came to see the band intro because I'm 93% that's John Batiste playing a melodica
For the  99 and 2000’s Luv Juvenile 😍😍😍👏🏾👏🏾
Black art ❤
Legends
every song I try to like the video again. So good as always.
I’m 44  still look 27 and shake it like I’m 22! And I so I appreciate what tiny desk is doing when it comes to rap music cause you hear Real instruments playing to a rap song is like beyond amazing I can’t even grasp how to put it in words🙏🏼
Ahh brings me right back  to the 2000s when gas was only $1.25, life was easy. 🙌🏽 those girls on Rodeo gave me the chills!!
Millennials checking in! Juvi took me back to the 99-2000! Well done!💵💵💵💵💵
You know they youngsters when the "Go DJ" wasn't reciprocated.
🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯✊✊✊ ❤❤❤ohh my fav, fresh and juve better than on big stage
This is straight fire!!!
Ay they need to bring back concerts like these locally STAT!!!
2025 millennials here right?!?! 💪🏻🙏🏻❤️
This high art yall… this reinforces why it’s important for artists to have a producer to build with and make sure they can actually perform what they record. This reinforces the importance of crowd control and call and response, why yall gotta ditch the two track, people come to see you perform and elevate the experience, not karaoke. *note I’m directing this specifically at the hip hop genre.*
This is still a bop🎉
Needed this ❤
I can't believe I just recently discovered these Tiny Desk concerts.  Juve's is the best so far.  And can't believe how good Mannie sounds also.  Sooo dope.
Juvie,  DMX, Busta, Tupac, Biggie, and Wayne always had the perfect voices for a song.
Nice….
Manny fresh 🎉
I wish he would tour this
Just found this. You know I love Mac, but this is the best tiny desk set of all time. I’d love to see someone top that omg. Thank you.
The Eagles of my generation
Is 400⁰ a church song?
Modern art
Absolutely tickled by the Doechii haters foaming in the comments while Gotye cameos in the Anxiety video. Thanks for two bangers!
This is one of the best concerts ever performed. Thank you NPR ❤️
Why does this sound like Smash bros Hyrule Castle?
We need Petey Pablo NEXT!!
Juvenile AND Jon Batiste?! What a beautiful world.
Did you bring Wacko and Skip?
npr you got back this white boy.
❤❤❤❤❤2025
Juviee is living the dream ova hea!!!!!!!!!! Class of 2000 baby!
My buddy Nick loves juvenile
Oh and the band too! Transposing the musicality and delivering! All of em!!
Man Juv and Mannie are special guys. Gave it all. Came out in the crowd. That was superb! They are for the people! 💯
This is for whatever moderatortook away my like a year ago. I know i was here because I was born in 83 and grew up on this. Stop taking away likes its weird
Top five tiny desk ever... Had to watch in the car, definitely part of my life's soundtrack....
10:05  Juve is a TRULY great performer.. his ability to keep his breath perfect, while rapping the lyrics with zero slips and perfect cadence is a testament to how seriously he takes his crafts.. he loves this shhii for real..
This is a pleasure to watch. I dont know any of them, but it was a belting performance.
16:02
Outstanding performance. I'm now a bigger fan.
Juvenile was the face of cash money a real g for life
Be careful what you ask for.
Manny did that ish at the end
Best comment. Ratchet 😂😂😂😂
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍✨✨✨✨✨✨✨
Green Shirt. 😉
Greatest love song. ❤️  besides scare face this my fave.

MANNIE FRESH 💯 THANKS A MILLION... JUVIE !!!!!
Them GIRLS CAN SANG!!!
🥰🥰😁😁😄😄😁😁😁🥰🥰🥰 me the whole 28mins
For me, this one has been the greatest performance in Tiny Desk's story. They cooked out there!
Me for the 10th time
This is the best TinyDesk. Most vibes Trinidad 🇹🇹 RepN.
Who’s rewatching after dreamville this year…
The best so far!
This is dope but should be called Mannie Fresh tiny desk. Manny know how to arrange music like nobody business.
My parents are from Mexico I didn’t know English til the third grade my first American friend was from New Orleans and gifted me a hot boys CD it was on ever since
This is my Favorite!!!
Simultaneously genius. & nostalgic..thanks, NPR! ❤️
Love juvenile this was dope AF ❤
Todayyyyy🔥🔥🔥
Not Jon Baptiste!  We just saw him on the keyboard opening the Nola SuperBowl!  Okay, not the Louisiana Philharmonica Orchestra!  Let's go!  I lost it for the last 8 minutes straight. Big Up to Juvie and Manny Fresh. 🎉🎉
Their Songs and Energy Always Been Fire.🔥I Thought these songs needed live instrument versions since they came out.    Here we are 26 27 years later 2024 2025.  Aye My fam loved Cashmoney so much my cousins and I begged My dad and uncle  (both musicians) to play bass part Back That Axx Up in our livingroom.  That was summer afternoon of 1999.    Off topic but my dad likes Follow Me Now and Flossin Season the most.  My parents always got familiar with all the music their kids admired.   Ok Back To the subject Juve! Fire!🔥Wayne! Fire!🔥Turk! Fire!🔥BG! Fire!🔥Baby !Fire!🔥Mannie! Fire!🔥

400 Degreez is such a good album 😫
Juvenile was and is still HIM🔥🔥🔥
Oh this ❤❤❤was a whole ratchet elegant soothing vibe,one of the best live performances I've viewed
turns out i was raised by Mannie Fresh.
Love's every minute of this.  Sometimes these pioneers of rap and hiphop start to feel washed up and forgotten about.  They don't realize how many people still rock with them.  Their music got me through middle and high school in the 99-2000s. Honestly.  I can tell Juvenile felt the live that day.  Honestly we'd probably have more artists still around if they really know how much we as a people appreciate them and their craft ❤
This is the best 🎉listen to this all day at work with my earbuds- working at the library and loving juvenile in my ear ❤
Manny dont get the credit he deserves for carrying the load of q label by himself
My ninja Juveee was faded!!! Salute 🫡
All day everyday
I can't thank you enough for this, I watch it all the time!
Had to run it byke in April 2025!🎉
This is the best tiny desk video, far from any other!

Stop fronting just skip to 20:04 -

This was perfect from him cause they from new Orleans they know live music.
Imagine every woman in your office singing along with slow motion like that and looking them in the eye after 😂
Man this will never get old✨️ 10:49
My best friend and I when we open Rose on a playdate.
I watch this when I need a pick me up. lol, Juvie and Manny Fresh just remind me of two dads in the garage when they're supposed to be mowing the lawn.
❤❤❤
Way too hot that boy went hot hot boy
26:22 sounds like Spider-Man lol
I watch this everytime I’m having a bad day.  White dude from south GA.   PROBABLY THE ONLY GUY WHO WAS WISHES HE WAS BORN BLACK
Dam Hella crispy sounding. Wouldn't expect anything less from the NOLA
Juve is a star
Fire!!!!! Love my city for this!!!

2025  just under 10million views... Yet some useless set by Usher has 20+million views...   Juvenile and Manny Fresh killed this one
Can we please get Ludacris next??? I need to hear diamond in the back on tiny desk please please 🙏🏾 @NPR
So was this federally funded? if so, I want a producers credit.
2025!!!
Turning Rodeo in a slow groove is grown man work!!!!
7:52
This set brought me more joy than anything I've seen in actual years. So much fun. I forgot how much I love it when black people and white people come together and just have a good time. The moments after 12:58 really took me back to a better time and gave me hope for the future. That was honestly wonderful. Thank you, Juvenile, Manny, and everyone else.
I fux with Juvenile. What a legend.
Is there a better Tiny Desk? So Good
No they didn't. Juvie brings back so many good memories man it was fun back in the day!
Best Tiny Desk Concert Ever!!

I love dem New Orleans Ninja 🥷 🎉
With Jon Batiste ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤💯✨️
The BEST tiny desk ever…
As a metal head from the mid 90s and late 2000s. I loved every second of this. The nostalgia feeling of hearing the songs my sister loved and top radio hits. I miss it
I love it ❣️
The musicianship from the band. The DJ work from Mannie. The performance from Juvie. This was just all so perfect.
Juvenile and Manny Fresh actually did good to be older, this was like poetry to me. They had some bangers, but I love the calm music with it more! This was so chill you can just vibe off this whole video.😎🤩☺💃🕺❤❤❤
Always had a crush on this man and he has aged nicely. Sheesh!
i know i'm late to this party but pls add a +1 to 'elder millenial brought to tears by seeing juvie/manny fresh on npr' on my behalf. it's like my #1 CD of junior/senior year of high school grew up and we finally reconnected at the 20(-something) year reunion
Sad to see that this is what people applaud
Has to be top 5 all time performance on tiny desk in my opinion am I wrong??
The strings on Back That A@%& make me weep 😢❤
If I ever heard something legendary in my life, it would be this man's voice. No one ever will ever never ever sound like juvenile.
It’s Saturday I’m. Feeling good cleaning and getting dressed to this GEM ❤
Juve always been a man of the people
This was surprisingly phenomenal.
Juvenile we Love you, G-Riduz , We made it man  Trump  Taken it to Ft.Knox The Barron's Reserves, It's Education for Our Nation New Occupation, Keepin it Real, Our Brothers going to make it . Please Excuse Me My Name is Diesel Fluid, how far are you from Philly, King Egypt on The Capital of Jersey. twin City Keep Riden  Sky High..

Ya'll gotta understand that this is levels above your regular music, even tho it's ratchet. Mannie Fresh's beats been fire. I wasn't into Juve, Hot Boys or the ''bling bling era'' tho, but I love powerfull music.. Can't deny talent. Mannie & Juve together are top tier.

Anyone know what Juvi was Drinking out the Can???
Imagine Mike Epps playing Juvenile in a Biopic film 😂
This is somewhere between my 50th and 75th Time
I come back to this one regularly. It's such a perfect coming together of so many elements of American culture, even as a Canadian, it reliably can bring me to tears.
I watch this on a weekly basis.
Juvi wrecked it
Juevy.   Lfg
Who ever thought this DEI guy would make the #1 wedding song😂
💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💯
Timestamps?

You can see it in their eyes...they traveled back to time that was simpler. Miss those days.
He brings out Grammy  award winners. this deserves an Grammy
He brings out Grammy  award winners. this deserves an Grammy
That saxophonist is killing it and having the best time
🔥🔥
Back again
This should have been in the superbowl halftime show.
That real Cash Money records!🔥🔥
Classic album THE TRUTH KING OF THE SOUTH
This should have been the 2025 Super Bowl!
Why’d it take me this long to find my new favorite tiny desk video
Kinda wish he performed Super Bowl with Wayne.
MANNY 😝🔥🔥🔥
I call the Mexican dude at work named Manuel Mannie Fresh and he has no clue.
The real half time show for New Orleans
Shout out to multiple Grammy Winner Jon Batiste in the green
The first song is a black James Bond theme song
❤❤❤❤
Juvi and BYB always comes to mind when I listen to this tiny desk
Class of 02 in the house!
Why aren’t they joining KDOT at this year’s Super Bowl?
this my fav video 🥳
Sound like game  of thrones 😂
im so happy juvi getting his flowers!
Who that intro sends chills from the childhood ….dam man 😅😢💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪
Omggggg I loved this! ❤🔥 pure nostalgia!
Still here
Necessary encore at the end there 💯
I manifested in 2003 I swear lol
I seriously wish they make a rockstar dub edition x
Who is here from “Night Cap” live in New Orleans?
The crowd was on point with Slow Motion. The crowd could of been back up singers on that song in the studio
Juvenile look like somebody Uncle who eats the fish right out the Grease
Kendrick should bring Juvenile for the Superbowl 👀
This is one of the best I’ve seen live frfr! Plus it’s nothing but greatness on the ones and twos
Rodeo still my Fav!
400 degreez sounded so good here!
Song so nice gotta he it twice!
I'm officially old now and the oldies but goodies couldn't be better!
This was amazing. I had to watch to the end extremely good performance.
So much better live than the original versions 👏👏👏🔥🔥
the band got the work release onsie on im done.
Mannie stepping into the crowd at the end was legendary
This is such a great set and it is great to see Juvie still killin it. But let's address the fact that without the G.O.A.T knows as Mannie Fresh , Cash Money Records would not be a thing.
best Tiny Desk ever!
Project Chick live on NPR is exactly how I saw being 45. 😂😂
I think a part of me lives for seeing Jon Batiste just show up in random stuff.
I'm back again!
My first rap song 😢kinda sentimental
I’m at this tiny desk.. still 2025😎⚜️
Awesome!  Drinking my coffee dancing while Floridian wife looks at me like I’m crazy.  Nola baby, how we do dat
🔥🔥🔥🔥 We need a 90s-2000's  tour‼️
❤😂
He might be magnolias DMX
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I’ve been in love with Juvie since 98 and ain’t nun changed ❤❤❤❤❤boy is fionnnnnneeeeeee
vax that thang up!
This is the best tiny desk concert ever!
Not me skipping all the way to the end just to hear the "BACK THAT A** UP" part!!!! Still love the flow of the orchestra!!
Whew!!!!! I really enjoyed this set. I need a nap now. Slow motion fo' me!!!
We NEED J back, FULL SUPPORT THIS WAY AND THAT WAY!!! 💯
Literally the best!
Please don't leave earth without doing a song with Kodak...lol❤🥰...I won't forgive you
I forgot to mention those two pretty brown voice ladies❤🥰... if this vibe was a bridge,  yesterday would be on one side,  and today would be on the other...I just would not know where to go,  and thus I would be lost in the music
Ok Unc!
One of the best videos I’ve seen
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wait, no slow motion? or did I blank out?
Yt blessed my alg
A year+ later I find myself thinking about this performance a lot
Where's the guy with the time stamps?
20:07 is why we are here 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Pure class! Every minute of this is amazing!!!
I bet a majority of newer rappers couldn't do it like this...
I'm back again. For the 1000th listen. All 23 minutes is pure bangers. I'd pay good money to see an hour long concert with everybody in the video. Good energy. Good folks.
This is what we needed for sb'25 we need them Nola boys
Best performance I’ve seen so far..
It’s 2025 and I still watch this often
O Melhor  Tiny Desk da historia!
Shii so fye
😂😂😂😂 THIS GOT MY LIFE TOGETHER!!!!
The violin player vibing 🎉
I’m really mad I didn’t know this existed until now….
Mannie Fresh the GOAT!!!
Very slick n smooth

Sometimes the algorithm blesses me. Thank you, Al
Speaking of underrated how bout Manny Fresh
Who here 2025 🔥💙??
Juvenile done got me out of my bed and shaking my 🙃🙃🙃
This is rather lit, honestly...
400 degrees is still in my rotation 🎉
As I white guy I sincerely apologize for singing along to all these word for word.
Manny fresh and juvenile tight. Everytime I see them they are together doing projects. That 💯
This is the coolest one I think yet🎉🎉🎉🎉😊
I discovered Juvenile after hearing Rylo Rodriguez use the On Fire sample on "Unnfuckwitable" and instantly loved his music. Watching these OG's continue to make music in 2025 is the best feeling. Couldn't believe it when he just popped up on Kodaks new album.   This is straight heat, so glad you guys made this.
Aaaaahhhhhh💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽
Please get Boosie on TD
Leggggooooooo Juvyyyyy
Chris brown PULEAAAAAASEEEEEE
Anybody else trippin seeing Nipsey Hustle reincarnated and playing the keys???
How they switch the intro to the song that was hard
😮‍💨 🎶
Much respect to the coolness rappers always bring . I love tiny desk, brings out the best of great artist  Nate dogg would of loved this RIP
Smiled the entire time. Enjoyable
My bad juvie my bad don’t knock it till you heard it
Love it
What is this? I started grooving out of nowhere. Wow

This is still 100 times better than anything new and current. Back at a time when people lived through things and turned to music to deal.
Everyone needs a wingman like Mannie Fresh
Dope!
Rodeo is my shiiiii 🔥🔥🔥
That Was Some Hot Hot Shiiii...❤
Slow Motion 😂❤
I didn't know what to expect AT ALL when I clicked this video, but I'm only 1:05 into it and had to comment that this is 🔥
I wasn't trying to watch this whole video but im stuck now 😡
Who dat in the back on the keyboard tho! ❤ Oh and I absolutely love Juvenile and Mannie Fresh! 🔥💯💜
OMG…..❤❤❤Juvenile and Mannie Fresh… love this!!!❤❤❤
My teenage self thanks npr for this!!!! 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
21:24 - Jon Batiste?
This goes so hard every time
I'd like to thank NPR for providing the conditions for rap with a band! Doechii, Anderson Paak, Cypress, etc. I enjoy hip-hop just a little bit more when a band does the instrumentation live.
Background singers in Rodeo ❤  Angelic.
Hands down best tiny desk segment.
Project chick still bangs.
Juvenile is fire 🔥🔥🔥 more please
This is so dope!!! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆👊🏾
🔥
NPR, could you contact Wheeler Walker Jr. about doing one of these?
*Imagine approaching the violinist and asking her to perform this. Lol!
This song still goes hard in the club 2025 🎉
Rip Soulja slim
mannie fresh underrated as an artist in general

I kept skipping over this even though the comments said it was fire. Finally watched it and it was 🔥🔥🔥. Can't believe I waited so long.
Goosebumps flash back

Some songs from Soulja Rags album would have been the cherry.
God knows what the future might bring
🔥🔥🔥🎹🎼🎧🎤🎷🎺📀💿
WOW, Just seeing this, watched atleast 5 times 😍😍❤❤🥰🥰🔥🔥🔥🔥, Juve The Great!!🎙
Real rappers put them in there place music 🫡🫡🫡🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼💙💙💙💙💙💙

Mr. Juve, you killed it big dawg. You and Mannie are legends.

Juvie to npr is like jada to versus
Pure joy! Bussin down in a library! 2025
7:52 This live version is amazing!
❤❤❤ I love the South!!!
One more time for 2025!
This hits as good as day one. As a 14 year old kid in the 90s on Greenville SC this was on repeat.
My teenage years right here! This my favorite tiny desk episode. So nostalgic ❤
Hands down the best tiny desk concert
Good memories! 80’s baby music. We rock.
Job is ell done..😊
21:44 They're so happy lol. Makes me smile
Damm lit af
This immediately took me back to my Freshman Year in Highschool... Juvenile was always my pick out of all the Cash Money line-up!😏
at the end the white boy is having the time of his life
blunted af jammin to this 🔥
I had to run this back in 2025
Definitely my favorite Tiny Desk
This feels like something straight out of Treme.
Ooh yeah 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
One of the better things I've seen on youtube.  From the era of rap where you could actually discern the lyrics.  Can't wait to see these guys in concert in 2025 down south!
🔥🔥Boi Juve! Them Victoria’ 🇲🇽 beers be going hard also !!
Fo do 99 and 20 2025s
Man these were the days
400 degrees with a live band is amazing
Yessssssssss
I forgot how much I love Manny Fresh! He a whole vibe 😂
Starting 2025 with this energy
Best live performance ever
This should be part of the NFL SuperBowl halftime show but…. the NFL fumbled the ball! What a shame
1/3/25 Checking in early
25 years later...Manny Fresh still looks like my Mama!!!
I recall about a decade ago or so this little club in Broward Florida was having a night featuring JUVENILE ( @ the old movie theater turned event place near US1, SAMPLE) ... SO he agreed to take me out, we get there and BECAUSE Juvenile was there, it was a bit extra ... And my 'date' tried to down play like who wants to even see Juvenile blah blah. Ha. UHM TF ME. I DO. DUH. ........I NEVER went out with buddy again. I was HEATED. tried to go back ,on my own the same night and there was no more entries. Packed. MY homegirl came with me and we were so disappointed. ,.
Really needed a camera on the audience the whole time.  They were as much of the performance as juve. Props whoever got these people on the room with mannie and the boyz
Like watching Jordan in Pippen... Manny fresh is nasty on the pad
30 minutes well spent!!!
I discovered this recently and I’ve watched it 3 times already. Their sound is so distinct and good.
Just saw Juvenile perform a hometown NYE show in New Orleans. Awesome time hearing all this live. Wild to think some of these songs are 25 years old!
Juvi the Great!!
Set list?
400 degrees flow is as crisp and on point as I've ever heard.  M-E-T-H-O-D Man and this.  That's it.
I’m glad I wasn’t there. Because I know err song from back to front… they would’ve thought I was Juve… 😂🎉
Mannie fresh is soo underrated!!
This is my all time favorite tiny desk it gets me going every time
Juvie is a Nola-treasure He’s ours
Juvie make a tiny desk a mansion
22:39 Jon Batiste smiling so hard
OG Juv is built different salute 🫡
Been listening to underground and mainstream rap since 95 ish. Huge east coast rap fan but gotta give it to juvie for thrown it down so spectacularly. Insane performance, so effortless
If Kendrick brings any of these NO boys out for the Super Bowl … I will die in peace 😂😂😂😂😂😂…
This is the most crunk Tiny Desk  Concert I've watched! I could feel the energy emitting from my tv. 🎉
i wish he did “vax that thang up”!
Bringing me back to my high school days 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
A real MC
I want that energy
I can't stop coming back to this!
Fresh my top 5 producers… highly underrated
If I Don’t Get A- “BG”- I Can’t
SALUTE!!!!!!!!!
MANNNNN LIIISSNNNNN THANKYOU JUVEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!RICHCHIEINONO!!!!!!!
Yaaasssssss so good 🎉🎉❤
My older self came here for Ani Difranco but then my 19 year old self saw this and started twerkin’ 😂😂😂
Back them vaccines up
🔥🔥🔥💯💪🏾
Jon Batiste in your rhythm is such a tremendous flex.
Best ❤thing I witnessed in 2024 merry Christmas
Christmas Eve 2024
What’s great about this is he’s is going base of memory. Not ear piece. Still one of the true Gs
HA!
16:15 is the GOAT song
I love when the camera faces the audience , all you see is smiling faces!
No no... can't even be mad at this... quite enjoyed it
Man I have watched this so many times!! The best one on here 💯
You know what, yeahhh
Whoever created Tiny Desk never dreamed it would go this far!
I watch this at least once a week
I need everyone in the entertainment industry to watch this and take note!!!!!!!! The stage presence,  the talent, this is how you entertain ppl. ❤🎉 I love this so much
❤❤ I enjoyed this!!!!
God i would love to see Brother Ali do this. He would destroy this fomat. His songs are perfect for this energy and they all have a posotive message
This one and the tech n9ne/ Kriss Kalico are aome of the best representations of Rap music of all time
The creative genius behind this tiny desk rebranding is amazing! Give that person a promotion and raise!
omg them 2 angels from heaven for Rodeo!!!!!!
Whoaaa dayyy
Man i miss being a teen, don’t grow up fast kids enjoy the youth
Juvie was always 🔥
Juvie raps about such relatable thibgs 😂 "pretty round brown driving me wild " by the Amours was 😍
Best tiny desk EVER
This is an example of Lil wayne hosting the Super Bowl and bringing out Louisiana artist, cash money, & young money would be crazy. 337 all day
I’m having a whole new appreciation for rap being done to live music…LOVE IT!
Not sure how you top this NPR.....but we are here for it.

23:47 "One more time!"
This going to be Sada baby when he get older
What a gift
The minstrel show lives on.
We need a new album! The new rap is mostly wack
Juve is so genuine man. Appreciate him and Manny so much for representing NOLA and Louisiana with their work.
Juvenile never got enough credit! This what I’m talking about 👏
For the culture
I  hate it here
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Juvie the Great!!!
Awesome! If there was no Juvy or Manny Fresh there would be no Lil Wayne. Believe that.
The camouflage worked... I didn't see them until 15 minutes into it. Good job, guys!
OMG SOOOOOO GOOD!! Yessssss❤❤❤❤❤
My favorite tiny desk. I love the audience participation 💪🏾

Juvie looks like he has only aged 5 years in the last 25 years.
Shii was like that🤣🔥🔥🔥🔥
Man this brought me back! Much love and respect!
Legendary the way I smiled the entire 28 minutes ❤❤❤
Juvi is the GOAT. This is definitely  top 5 concerts on tiny desk.
This got mad energy.. the best tiny desk
This might be the best one I’ve seen. These dudes know how to perform
What a epic session
I have always wanted to play drums in a hip hop ensemble like this, all the brass and synthesizers, strings, love it.  Juvy and Mannie Fresh with some awesome musicians!!
Great way of bringing back music that moves us all, thanks to all that laid down thier pride to come together. Great music
Bruh I used to see Juvi at club karma in Lafayette Louisiana back in the day he been cooking!
Big fan of Tiny Desk. 10+ years and..no cap. Juve did a tip 5 if not top 3! Performance
OUTSTANDING Juvi. and M-Fresh....thank you once again.
Still looking fresh Manny
Best tiny desk everrrr. The energy & nostalgia is willlld & so good!
The greatest tiny test to date 😊😊😊
This was dope asf
The meme brought me here. I’m grateful 😊
I don't like a ton of rap but I loved this lol
When the strings started.... sheeeeeeeesh goosebumps.  My god have we missed out on juvy for a long time.

They look like they had so much fun!!!
Having John Baptiste is legendary.
This is AMAZING
Loved every minute of it!!! ❤❤🎉🎉
I thought Facemob's was #1, but this is the best.
Best performance on tiny desk especially because I grew up listening juvenile and mannie fresh 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Is that King Iso on the keyboard
504 Representing, ya heard! Amazing set from Juve and Mannie!
The tiny desk performance we had no idea we needed. ❤
The talent behind all these instruments is beautiful beyond words!
I wonder if DMX listened to Juvenile? I just noticed they have similar flows!
He’s lowkey a vocalist, great breath control ❤️
This is the most unhinged thing ive seen fall out the sides of the cubicle
Can’t believe I haven’t seen this before!
LETS FREAKING GO
Everyone is having so much. So many memories with those songs!
I smiled during the whole video!!
They know they did that
Juvie with live instruments is 🔥🔥🔥. So in conclusion, I know a Cash Money + symphony collab needs to be done like yesterday. And please film 🙌🏾✨
Mannie comes in with the board on “Ha” and sets that apart
This joint was cranking.  He got the whole cell block D as the musicians.
House real big car real big D real big everything real bigggg 🔥🤣-mannie
Slow motion ❤
I needed this today 😭😭
This is incredible but they got me way too hype for Nolia Clap to not follow through. Love Juvenile and Mannie Fresh—they’re hip hop icons. Cash money era was crazy. This music will always make me dance!
She was absolutely spectacular!
I absolultely love this tiny desk, energy was amazing!
I loved this! Got me smiling so much!!
Jordan Poole dad
Happy Thanksgiving
In my stunning voice!! Wooday!! That was beautiful!!
TikTok sent me here❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Poets going to poet.
After all these years, this has to be my favorite tiny desk. These were songs that played at school dances but i have new respect for Juvenile and Mannie and Louisiana sound. I keep coming back to watch it again and again.
The band... SHEEESH they're amazing
How you just gonna leave me crying like that after that extraordinary performance! Thank you Doechii!
The bass players face always cracks me up. Like you can tell he’s a church dude who is hoping his mom doesn’t see this 😂

One of my favorites growing up. This is awesome. Wild im just finding this now
You’re all here for 19:40
Slow motion in this setting goes hard af
That’s someone’s grandpa 🤣
Without a doubt one of my favorite tiny desks
Louisiana Culture
That was amazing 👏 🤩 🙌 😍 ❤️
I’m pretty sure I’m responsible for at least a thousand of these views at this point 😂
a moment in time when people agreed to stop being fake for 27:59 minutes
16:10
The way that Jon cannot stop laughing is pure bliss
He didn't finish 400 degrees.
Outstanding performance.
Great show
Straight 🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥
How many tiny desk guests have the crowed singing songs release two decades ago cmon mane!
Greatest love song ever wrote!!!

Was watching @BhightAtl podcast. Hotboys on there talking about their tiny desk. Said ppl were telling them it was the best 1. Came across this today and let me say THEY AIN’T NEVER LIED. Performance LIT 🔥🖤❤️🖤 that energy 💯❗️. Manniefresh 1 OF THE MOST UNDERRATED DJ/PRODUCER of ALL TIME. s/o Hot Boys 🔥🔥🔥
Superb
This is amazing!
Everyone in their early 30s including myself is so grateful for this one. Juvenile and mannie fresh  gave us a show we really needed.
On god 400 Degreez is a top 10 rap album of all time
The best Tiny Desk ever !!!! They killed it !!!
Im single... N it took me there.. n he broke up with me
epic shi righ chea
Man these guys really know how to connect with the crowd. Grew up listening to Juvenile and this was a delight to see them on Tiny desk. Thank you to all who made this happen!
Was 🗑 then & 🗑 now. Shame on NPR for pushing their woke agenda to the point they're now promoting violence, misogyny, materialism, drugs & degenerate behavior & letting them masquerade as artists.
I’m gonna start saying ha after every sentence like juve
400 degrees , seeing fresh soak in the mic, I always wondered how they got that pitch, nice to see it 22 years later
Man, just had  a while concert in my living room. Thank you Tiny Desk!! 🎉
i love their energy i have a mixtape back when datpiff was in operation its called "uptown nolia boy" i love every track on there.
"Change of plans, then Juvenile came on You know that's my favorite song I was 15 minutes late because I tried to be great Dancing on my fate Your opinion, not today" ~Leikeli47
I thought, no way I watch all 28 minutes. I watched all 28 minutes. And then watched the last minute twice.
Come back Juvenile!!! It’s 11/28/24 and we still playing this 🫶🏽🩷 My generation will always love The Original Cash Money Crew
Yaaaaasssssssss👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
I always come back to this 1
Solely subbed for this
100%
My only regret in life is that I was not in this room when this was preformed
Can we get Pink Floyd on Tiny desk….
Hot Boyz tiny desk 2024🔥🎶🔥🎶🔥💯‼️
This gives me hope
I want me a king from down south NOW 😂❤

20:05 JUVEY
400 degreez will always be my jam! This takes me back to my undergrad days! ⚜️
One thing bout Juve & mannie they gon show out for our city no matter where they go… I love to see it❤
This is That.  Word
Fiyah🔥🔥🔥
absolutely brilliant
This performance just puts a huge smile on my face
I’m sure NPR would be supportive of the lyrics at the ~18-minute mark if these were white men.
Aye!!
Whyd Mannie fresh turn out to look like a lesbian woman?
How many bottles of black hair dye do y’all think was used for this performance??
The Best
This is the type of club scene I demand in 10 years, thank you in advance.  ❤❤❤❤
Omg it just keeps getting better and better! Juvenile’s gonna spoil me! And then he brings in Trombone Shorty?! Listening to juvenile, looking at Shorty smile… Have mercy on me! Fuq! 🥵😄❤️
Coming to Cincinnati Dec 15th????
Please 🙏🏾 ONE MORE TIME!!!! 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾💯💯💯💯
Stretchin the glutes!!!
Sad when he drop rap let alone the south was that popular yet he would’ve MAJOR

I wish they did Gone Ride With Me, but other than that this was perfect.
Imagine if hot boys did a tiny desk 🤯
Man. I didn’t expect to watch this whole thing. So cool.
Juvenile aged so well he looks good !
All the musicians with the jail uniform 😂😂😂
If we ever build a time machine, I want to send these guys to like the 1800 and have them perform this in front of Beethoven.
This was soooooooooo good
I looooove being black
I promise I'm having Mannie fresh and the entire hot boys concert at my wedding. I've always said this! I looooooooooove love love. My favorite group ever. Love it all

How'd I miss this 😭😭😭 uncle Juvie in the polo and Soulja rag on here is NOSTALGIA 😂 Mfs called doc and took us back to the 99 😂
Wow. I wanna go to one of these now... great artist elevated by this format!
They should’ve let the strings ride that intro longer before they came in
Juvie Tiny Desk top 5 for sure… 🔥🔥🔥
Juvenile was my favorite from the group. He definitely never disappoints!
OG murdered this whole Tiny Desk 🔥🔥
I actually live inside that desk. Is been lovely hearing all these different musicians.
Juvie's encore was put this over the top. Peak performance 👏 👌 ✨️
I feel 18 again. I absolutely love Juvenile and Mannie Fresh and the entire Cash Money Team. I grew up in Mississippi only 2 hrs away, so NOLA culture is beautiful to me! ❤❤❤  Just watched the Hot Boyz reunion last night!  I was screaming all night!
I wish someone make a hip-hop/rap/funk rock covered version “I Need A Hot Girl” and published on YouTube. Cause would be dope for the year 2024.
The definition of cringe.

To the lady who shouted “one more time…” we all owe you a debt for the best encore of all time. 🙏
I'm voting for Donald Trump ONLY because "I Need A Hot Girl" was rudely interrupted by a Kamala Harris ad.
I need a whole album of this.

Give Mannie Fresh his credit.
This is essentially MTV unplugged glad we got this

You know what it is to make nothing out of something!

First time watching tiny desk, this was absolutely perfection. Juvie and Mannie did their thing, everybody made this so enjoyable!!
They killed this!! 😅😅😅
Whoever came up with this small desk concert idea needs a raise. It’s inclusive of all genres and nostalgic

474 David Unions
Just by doing this little concert. It totally blew away what’s happening in Rap music for the past 10-15 years.
Juvenile looks like he robbed you 10 years ago and just gave you $500 back now bc he’s an Uncle. 😂
Maybe now is a good time to consider changing your name. "Juvenile" doesn't seem to fit...and hasn't for a LONG time.
Juvie my favorite. I’m 51 y/o female. I still know his lyrics. That’s my imaginary husband
this made me feel so good. RIP to hop hop music
Minnie fresh красавчик ,как в старые добрые времена ….Juvenile-мое почтение ,как всегда на высоте

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This was really a year ago.. felt like I just seen it.
Juvenile killed it he deserves more respect
Let's get Ludacris to play at Tiny Desk.
The world criminally slept on Juvenile's jazz era.

This brought me back to 1999! Man we sure partied like it was 1999 aboard the USS Kitty Hawk! Juvenile got me through those hard times. Such a pleasure to see him do it live!
MTV Unplugged
I love  this ❤
Those gold make Juve look like his breath stank
Juvie is a MF LEGEND, PERIOD!
This alone deserves a Grammy and a induction 🔥 🔥

This tiny desk got the white boys working with rhythm in that crowd hahaha
The band was on point!
One of the best tiny desk concerts, great energy
Why do we celebrate black music month? I'm native and still to this day don't understand why we need to celebrate anyone as a specific race. This world we live in gives us false hopes and dreams because the people who took over this place have created the lives we think we should have. Everyone let's wake tfu!
Dope !   This is incredible.
MIN 20:15 THE BETTER

I'm hosting Juvenile and his band in Seattle in a couple weeks and was expecting a total club vibe but this has me VERY pleasantly surprised and excited! What an incredible energy!
These guys have so much talent they don't get old
If cash money woulda stayed strong, every other label woulda needed permission to share the light💪🏽

I love where I’m from 💜🤌🏾🎯
being a ‘95 child, i remember hearing some of these songs growing up in passing. and listening to current music, you hear some of what older music had to offer; that and what gets sampled.   it brings me joy to see who my fav artists fav artists are and their contributions. honored to be able to watch npr for performers like this of this caliber.

Intro "400 degrees"... Ayeeeeee!😜
This was amazing! Rap and an orchestra….amazing !!!
Big Salute to Juvenile & Mannie Fresh, 2 the greatest ever!!!  This was legendary!!! 💯💪🏾🔥🔥🔥
Wrong crowd, but nevertheless, it was 🔥
Juve voice control on point, pretty impressive.
This was dope!
We need Lil Wayne, Rihanna , Lauren Hill I can go on and on. Morgan Wallen
Just now seeing this, but I remember growing up with my dad listening to Juvenile. This has to be one of the best tiny desk performances ever up there with Mac.
I was happy to see Manny there with Juve!!

This was the best suprise of the year. Juvenile sounds exactly like he does on the record.
I think Juvenile and those performing with him felt so energized and appreciated by the energy they got back from the audience!
Juvenile is one of the GOATs of the South.

Uffff prolly best production ive seen here on the rappers side of tiny desk amazing 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I never see an artist for their color. The music doesn’t have a race. Why are black people so racist?
Anyone else come back every few months and run this back?
This is on FYAH!!!!!!
Summer of 99’
I can't believe NPR is doing this with all that profanity. Loved it as a kid but now it's kinda uncomfortable 🥵
This a good concert but is that Alyn from hull playing that pencil case/baby keyboard in the back. Asking for my house of dragon family?
Ayeee Juvie🐐🔥🔥 Y’all turnt fa the Dickie suits too. Real N.O ⚜️
This has got to be the best Tiny Desk ever. Juvenile flow is tighter than it was 25 years ago and Fresh still bringing the heat 🔥 Plus when the artists are having this much fun ,it's a different vibe
Crazy
Juvenile being the uncle tearing up the family BBQ  20:15 my ex..  currently a teaxher and government official...  would tear it up

NPR:  Juvenile, we need the inner city ratchetness to be acceptable by our donors. 🤔 Juve: Say less. 💆‍♂
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I truly love these n!gg@z. They were THE party of the late 90's/early 2,000's and no one could even come close to touching them. The only thing missing was the rest of the Hot Boys 🎉💯
My homes did that
I would have went crazy, I've loved juvie since I was way too young to even be listening to him 😂 I thought 400 degrees sounded good, that jazz version of Slow Motion went crazzzyyy
Dope asf
Best one yet.
Back down memory lane six flags dr summer 99 Lindley middle school !!! Atlanta Ga🙌😜💯
John Baptiste lookin like, what did i agree to????😅🤣🤣🤣
The best concert. Mannie Fresh tore it up.
😎💪
I love how everyone in the back looks like they are having the time of their lives.
You said you was going to take me to see Juvie...loved it
Juvie and Mannie are the textbook examples of "still got it".
One of my favorite musicians of all time. Shout out to Sheri 😉

Juvenile for VP
I'm from a time when you heard 20:14 come on everybody danced with everybody you getting pushed on something and you better hold on like a man.
Lol mannie looked so nervous to be cussing and saying bad words the whole time... so adorable
no Wrekonize??????
Mannie Fresh is an A.T.G All-Time Great

I was laid off last week and haven't done much except my morning runs and then it's back to my bed. I just learned about this tiny desk concert, the first one I've EVER watched and I smiled, danced, clapped, laughed and felt nothing but joy. I truly needed this!!!! You never know how healing music actually is. Whoever cleared this is, indeed, in need of a raise and extra PTO days! Jouvie and Manny and the whole Cash Money squad really changed music for us!!!! Thank you!
He said he ❤ 🐱 but he ain’t licking …still gets me every time 😂😂😂
My lord
The livest Tiny Desk ever! What a VIBE! Juvenile and Mannie Fresh greeting their fans was everything.

Nobody shows up and shows out like New Orleans <3 Sometimes I'm frustrated by the lack of usable roads and potable water And then I see things like this and yell at the closest person to me, "New Orleans is the greatest city in the world!"
My nephew on kit❤

Well this is the greatest thing maybe ever done by anyone.
On Rodeo he should of broken it all the way down and let it end with the instrumental smooth it all the way out...and no "Bounce Back"?  Man Bounce Back was arguably his baddest track...and the coolest dude in the whole vid is my man in the green shirt, homie too cool!
Waaaooo  I do don't know what was  tiny desk  after  l see juvenile an manny
Whoever said, "One more time" is the GOAT in the audience. That encore was... 🤯🤯. These  whole set was  🤯
I’m here for the 5th time. Juvenile is the Greatest Tiny desk concert periodt! The fact that he did “Back that thang up”twice speaks for itself. The musicianship and artistry is just wow!
This is hands down the best Tiny Desk concert! Juvenile still got it and he got them hits! Can’t forget about Mannie Fresh and his legendary beats! 🔥🔥

Who knew i needed Juve and Mannie on Tiny Desk
so much JOY from everyone!!! iconic is an understatement. happy to see all these nola natives ❤⚜️ i was born in Metairie and grew up in LaPlace so just outside of New Orleans. my sister looooved her Juvenile CDs and being raised catholic we would blast it when our parents weren’t home 😂 i love to see our culture and music having an impact. it’s truly beautiful and Jon Batiste is a ray of sunshine. i just saw their coachella performance together and it didn’t even compare to the energy at the tiny desk. California tried tho😅 bowing in reverence to everyone involved in making this happen
This whole team killed this they really brought it.
He stole this whole song!
200% energy , my bluetooth speakers were tired out after  27min of Juvenile

As an ATLien i cant STAND New Orleans Saints fans...But ill FIGHT you over Cash Money, Juvenile, and No Limit 😂😂
17:00 Juvenile spitting young Lil Waynes verse 😂😂😂
Juvenile is casually sipping and holding a drink while memorizing and spitting 20+yrs of 🔥 lyrics like its nothing. He makes performing look ridiculously easy😂
🔥
...ohHHHHHH JUVI.....   eeeeeee....
Oh I can’t wait🎉🎉🎉
Fact that person deserves a 25k bonus
best tinydesk
Face was the best, but Juvie was my favorite. 😂💯

This was like finding that last chicken wing when you thought you ate all the wings already! Savored every song! Thank you Tiny Desk!
Manny Fresh is legend. Doesnt get enough credit

Og Arkansas
Hooooooh yeah that's a TDS oooh
A complete massacre. Juvi is a bon-a-fide talent and Manny Fresh is an actual genius. The soldiers from the church and high school band were on time too.
Juvie should still be making music.  He is one of the best to come out the NOLA
They should release this on Spotify
Juvie, where is Tiny Desk Part 2??!!! Let’s go for the 99-2000 🎉🥳🎶
the man is a legend, can you please put like one intern on this to transcribe the captions to eliminate all of the the [music] and [lyrics] with actual CC, I could do it in ten minutes, please be better about this with fast rap
The ORIGINAL coining of the term bling
💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽
Excuse me but how attractive is this band!?!?
Guitarist is the low key mvp. Whole thing is tight. This is my 3rd or 4th time watching this.
Crazy that as soon as the cello and violin came in, everyone got up. We all knew what was coming.
Back to listen to this for the 300th time
o lord
I love mannie fresh ..great ernergy..u can tell his at a great space in life
One of the best tiny desk ever!!!
👍 had a good time seeing them after so long, they still got it
I really like his performance brings back memories

when mannie fresh started the "OHHH" in set it off, i ran through my brick wall
They need to pick a better audience
THIS WAS SUPER  CLASSIC !!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤
My conscious: Are you going to watch this again? My id: Mind your business 💅🏾
i got mad love for Juvie... but let us not forget that he sold us out by making "Vax that thang up" 🤦🏾‍♂️
This is my favorite one by far.
Why am I just seeing this after 9 months...I felt like I was at this concert vibing In the audience. Loved me some juvenile in my early 20s, hearing the live versions is fire!
Bruh that 400 degrees gave me goosebumps.
Man I love it old school

Listened to this with headphones on. The mix/sound engineers hit it out of the park "again."  One of the best Tiny Desk concerts ever! 100 percent epic!  Juvenile's fo reel!
NPR music. Thank you so much for keeping it adult and genuine love. Every artist you put on here and their performance of true classics of our human art through music... see how the tease saddened everyone thinking wouldn't be preformed. Everyone who knows the song remembers what they were doing. when that song came home, which gives us some joy. in what that song did for us, in those times.
Man he did set it off💪🏽🔥🔥
Juve the Great
1990's in the house  !

Juv should do a concert tour with these musicians.
RIP Magnolia Slim
OMG OUTKAST next!!! 🔥🔥🔥
I know who is the coldest,no doubt!!

Cash money and the whole crew is hip-hop.. The south had something to say in the 90s and they ain't gave the ball back since...
They got half of the Hotboyz together let's just hope they can get weezy and turk so we can get this reunion we all been waiting for.. 🙏🏾
Love this

Ayoyyyyyyyy
Mannie Fresh a GENIUS HE DESERVE HIS FLOWERS❤️❤️❤️‼️‼️‼️
Bro we had hot music growing up
i dont usually comment man, but i honestly sometimes wish i can go back in time when this was the music i played off a CD player. Im 39, i would love to go back in time for a few hours and vibe.
Set it off is one of the best rap songs ever on god.
It was mannie fresh the whole time
The ad libs did it for me manny did it for me Juvenile voice it’s over for me in satisfied ❤

HE DID THAT!!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Welcome back! This isn’t your first time here 😁
Mr. Juve still gets me 😂
Taking it out the box
🔥
This never gets old!
That was mindblowing. I bought my first Cash Money CD 20 years ago (Chopper City in the Ghetto by BG). Within seconds of pressing play, I knew I was onto something special. Mannie Fresh, Juvenile, Lil Wayne, BG, Birdman & the rest of the Cash Money collective have helped change the sound of modern music. Watching these legends tearing it up at NPR was a joyful experience. Deep, deep thanks from the core of my soul.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Imagine if DMX coulda done one   Rip
Please do Chief Keef
Honestly, one of... if not THE, best tiny desk concerts. That is no small feat. There are some GOOD performances, but this one was so different, so unique, so throw back!
Would’ve been at this Tiny Desk acting a fool !! 😜
🔥🔥🔥
NSFW!!😂😂
One thing i can say about Mannie Fresh is that he makes his presence known throughout an album, but he doesnt try to be bigger than the artist..
This is EVERYTHING!!!!
They went crazzzzyyyyyyyyyy ❤
Beautiful 😂
I’ve never knew what he was saying.20 years later😩 😂thank you Tiny desk! Great rendition Juvenile.
I come back and listen to this once a week.
Manny fresh for president
🔥🔥🔥🪖🪖🪖🔥🔥🔥
This concert was lit! I wish I was there!
Hbd juvi
Incredible
Juv still not done with that drank boy this was a legendary moment he was one of my favorites rappers growing up he was over looked big juv
Ayeeeeeee❤
I was born in 95 in Houston, I remember when New Orleans came to our city after Katrina and they became our family, those ppl are very unique and full of soul and energy, from the accents to the food to the culture, this concert is very telling of who they are.
I needed jezzy to have this energy during his tiny desk.
Its crazy its been 7 months already
Mannie Fresh is everything Khaled wishes he can be on the boards. That boy Mannie making beats off his voice lol
Juve was always one of my favorites and i thought he was cool af.
Triple beam beat
This is so HYPE , i am at home gettin it . Real music by real musicians ❤ 🔥 ❤ 🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
FRANK OCEAN NEXT !!!😭
He should’ve did Ride With Me
Yall be too young to kbow this but juvi dated devontay riggin back in 1996. Devontay riggin ( RIP ) be my older brother and i actually met juvenile  We never shook hands but i walked in on my brother mounting juvi from behind him and was riding him hard. Juvi got embarrased bc i said it smelled like soneobe stepped in dog fecal matter so he then broke things off wirh my bro breaking his heart. 2 years later my bro killt hinself and i always felt juvi was to blame.  He never came to the funeral  Until he apoligizes im boycotting him
I enjoyed this !!! Ratchet but yet very classy  !! Love uncle mannie ❤
Here after Justin Timberlake's TDC -- these are such a vibe.
This is legendary
I would been vibing hard !!! I love , love Juvenile and Manny!!!❤
This is the very first one I went start to finish without skipping a song or a second.  Cash Money straight 🔥🔥🔥🥵
This was much needed Juvenile a living legend!
That’s aging like fine wine.  I was a little white kid all up on this stuff, and this is better now than then.  Way to make realness.
That. Was. AWESOME!!😂😂❤😂❤❤❤❤❤
Ive always liked his voice. So special.
Performances like this that let me know God is real.
lol is this a library
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This is officially the greatest tiny desk of all time . Please disagree but I don't think you can!  Not even close
this hea magnificent
I dropped real tears watching this. Much needed
RIP Soulja Slim
Came back again bc this was so 🔥
❤❤❤
Красавчики
Juvy understood the assignment !!
So rarchetly beautiful. NOLA's finest!
O my lawd did they show out ❤❤❤
Watching and listening to this video is probably my one of the best random decision I’ve ever made.
20:00 Trust
Juvie💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾 When the culture was about the culture❤
This makes me so happy but also sad because you know how equally wonderful one tidy desk with DMX would be :(
beautiful!
This was so good!!! I’ve watched this 20 times and it still feels like the 1st!!! Thank you Tiny Desk for this!!!
lol
Bring Andre nickatina on…
That was clean. It is funny how back in the days we thought it was just simple rhymes. But man compared to what is playing now. This is timeless.
So good! 🤩🥰😜
Mannie Fresh looks like a fun guy haha
Guys, this is a library..
Such a great concert dang these were the good old days. I could listen to this on repeat daily. 💯
That's big for Jon Batiste to show up but its nothin for the fam connects
😂 I felt like I was having the time of my life in a hole in the wall ❤
Amazing
OMG THAT WAS F'N AMAZING !!!!
Waiting for black eyed peas to come on here I need to hear where is the love last!💯
Didn’t play “ in my life”   Disappoint from ny
Aint no way this tiny desk aint top 5!! Quit playin!!❤

I was already loving the performance...then Slow Motion hit...big hit of nostalgia
I wanted project B, I just was surprised when they started playing it 😄❤
Juvie and the worlds best stud 😂🔥
Is it crazy that I listen to this whole thing like it’s actually a concert , once a week ?
The way rappers from New Orleans used to give it up in their lyrics will forever be untouched .
One the best tiny desk concerts I've seen!!!
I need his background instrumentalist IG AND TIK TOKS! They fine as FFFFFF 😮😮😮😮❤❤❤❤
Nice ! Take this on the road come up North East love Juve and Fresh !
This song will live on forever! ♾️
my man killing that cello!!!!
Juvie a legend
I grew up listening to juve n cash money. Bumpin in my 94 Honda Accord.   Cash Money > No Limit  Never thought I'd be watching this fire from Juve 20+ years later!
Grew up listening to Juvenile & Cash Money.  This was so dope!!!
❤❤❤❤❤
This is brilliant!
This reminds me of the movie hustle anf flow. Whoop that trick!
This was intensely good, holy smokes.
Great Great😊❤
Man I enjoyed this so much like who would have thought! Who don’t love Juvenile 🥰…
I’m here again 😂

The fact that crowd asked for it again just cemented how dope that song is. That was straight love from Juvenile.
First Tiny Desk Encore?! Amazing!
I will forever maintain that Juvie is a the Big Chief. Mannie Fresh is the wild man. Set it Off is a Mardi Gras Indian song.
This will go down as the best that's ever been done...
Juvenile 2024🎉!!! 🇺🇸
Saw them do a half time concert at a Pelicans game and it was the best time I ever had at something I didn't know was coming before it happened.
I love a MAN that love WOMEN .
Nice
If Wizzie was there.....the old Wizzie not Tunchie lol
project bihhhh ayyyyeee! insanely good
Juvenile Live vocals is A1, no rapping over the song like most do..
Man this is why my knees are bad! He really has had us twerking for 20 years
Wayne and mannie fresh would go dumb on tiny desk especially with that “go dj” 🔥
These ladies can sang so pretty wow
This a great rappers  from New  Orleans  and the great band wow  and singers
I want 2 see my Queen  Eli Mac and her great band from Hawaii  on the Tiny desk
THANK YOU MANNY FRESH FOR NOT BEING AN OVER HYPE, HYPE  MAN!! GREAT PERFORMANCE!!😊
It's great! Many many thanks.
Hardest Tiny Desk Concert TO DATE!
The female vocals off the chain! Who are they???
Juvenile an Fresh this Is Iconic
I can't hear the pther rapper's part either. The band sounds good.
I can't hear Juvenile he's not loud enough on the rapping part
This was HOTBOYS
My gawd! That was so good🌟
He should get a live band tour
This fasho put me on juvenile he fasho on my playlist 😂
I have probably watched this 💯 times it never gets old...
🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾‼️

Greatest set ever
My favorite tiny desk performance the most lively one
Dj Mannie fresh, you need your flowers bro.
GURL WHO IS YOU PLAYIN WITH
I love how they looked and pointed to each other when they said “WE BE MAKING HITS YEA AFTER HITS YEA” made me proud because they really do and I love that for them🔥👏🏾😂
凶暴である　Tシャツ。 どこで手に入れたんだろ。 素敵すぎるやろ。
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
DOPE 🔥🔥🔥🔥
This performance by Juvenile and Mani Fresh and all these talented songstresses and musicians — literally got me through my day today. Thank you all so much much ❤.
😂😂😂
Juvenile flow is my favorite of all rappers
This was so lit
Hopefully they can get tupac to to a tiny desk😉
This what happen when you keep tight with pressure no outsider welcome we got this.
Salute Juvie & Manny N-O finest salute
When The New Orleans Philharmonic Orchestra meets The Calliope Project. What a Beautiful Marriage.
This takes the homesick feeling right away......yaheard me.
I don’t know how many times I’ve watched this!! Love this!!!
I like how unpretentious they are and make everyone feel comfortable whereas some artists take themselves too seriously.
I've watched this so many times. There's just something cool about the mix of these genres. I also like how they could sing the lyrics for real and be themselves. It's my fav tiny desk concert. Just vibin
Still look the same man luv Juve❤
Would love to see digable planets do this platform… I love the diversity of the performers!
I'm not being biased because I'm from New Orleans, and the Magnolia Project but Juvenile really probably had the best tiny desk, and I'm only saying that because of how much we're so connected to live music down here in the boot. Music is in our DNA
One of the best yet😂💯💪🏾🔥🔥🔥
L9ved the horns and mannie n juv some of lyrics i grew out of frfr but overall cool. Still lookn good juv n man
Look at my cousin Charlie 😍
How I started my Monday!!  What a surprisingly happy feeling.  The last song brought back some really happy, memories from my military days in GA!!  My hip hurts now ...thanks Juvenille!!
I love the vibe ,🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯
Definitely looked and sounded like a great time
These dude's provided a LIFETIME of memories with their music
Yo some of mannie fresh beats are hard to play over strings
Who here after watching jeezy performance lol
This performance was fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥 love the tiny desk concerts.
Juvie‼️🔥
🔥
this is the best performance yet fresh is live
This was good, but I'm mad that he didn't perform "Ghetto Children" with this band.  I would've loved how it would've sounded in this setting.
Central fla.. 43 years old.  Had my hair standing up...been long time
I was born in 97. Thank you for this.
Now can npr complain when they play it at work?
I never smiled so hard watching something in my life 🔥🔥🔥
Yassssssss 🔥 he bodied this 🔥
They still got it! Retired come out do this live music thang
Juvenile is one of the best rappers from the 90s and 2000s. He’s underrated when it comes to lyricism because his wordplay is great and can craft an amazing verse on a feature or solo. Nothing but classics.
The best tiny desk ever…504 represents
Mannie looks like Bookman from good times
Where is Boosie!  This will bookend the Louisiana vibe.
Class and Hood come together and make a baby… definitely one of my favorite concerts!!!
Wow he still got it!!!
"greatest love song ever wrote" had me in tears.   If they would've played Nolia Clap, my head would've exploded.
all good
You: How many times have you watched this? Me: Yes😊
Straight fire 🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 I dedicate this to my nephew Blake love u and ❤ miss you brother
Best tiny desk so far even gave an encore. The whole tiny desk was involved crazy!!!

I love the intro for 400 degrees ❤
Mannie fresh is low key and this is awesome af
Another one Juvey the legend
I must watch this at least once a day! love the vibes and by far the best tiny desk concert big up Juve
Juvie timeless
This is music. A sho nuff expression of that man and his experiences
Yes this has to be absolutely the best Tiny Desk!
It’s amazing how music brings people together ❤😂
Back 7 months later to watch this. 4th time watching! 🔥🔥
Has to be one of the BEST tiny desk concerts ever!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤
Babbbby I loveeee me some Juvie!!
Now seeing so much similarity between him and Buck but yeah, they were together for a minute
RIP Soulja Slim.
I like the Grammy award-winning dude playing the Christmas present.
The best one yet! The musical talent is awesome.
98 was one of my favorite years in hip hop & 400 Degrees was a big part of that.
Love the way they ran the song back at the end! The energy was amazing from both sides, and how they just gave the crowd what they wanted. ❤🔥
I done watched this 20 times, it was random AF and I loved every minute of it every time.
Juvie still looks good after ALL these years!!!
JUVIE
Yes❤❤❤❤
Juvenile is Mike's Epps long lost brother
Coming back after jeezy, we need a Dope Boys of the south tour......would feed families
This was fireee ❤❤❤
I lost it when he said….mmmmmhhh I’m a 1999 driiiiiverrrrrrrr
THIS IS SO GOOD
The BEST tiny desk ever!!! This is a moment in history!🎉
He’s a real artist+performer…im an 80s baby i was blessed to grow up in this era😂
Juve is just crazy with it. Underrated talent
Ahhhhh!!!! This was so good.
As I listen to today’s music and of yesterday such as this, the lyrics promote the nonsense we see wmn exalt uplift advocate and demonstrate today.
How do you get tickets for tiny desk concerts????
Well now we need weezy to come on to. I think that might shut NPR down though
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
That was awesome‼️ I wanna be in the crowd
Turk was sliding in this song
Had to watch again during black history month -this black history 💪🏿
How ya gonna call yourself Juvenile if you've got gray hairs in your beard?

Iykyk, that's all imma say🤷‍♀️
Easily in the top 3 tiny desk concerts of all time, Juvie crushed it
Omgeee this is the best tiny desk concert I've ever seen!!! I've been jamming, smiling, twerking, laughing allat!!! Juve and Mannie Fresh still raw asf🔥🔥🔥
Amazing. Can watch over and over again!
Every time I come back to this tiny desk performance, I always think what was I doing listening to Juvie at 13 😂

This did not have to go as hard as it did.
Man, ☺️ took me back. I can 't believe it's been over 20 yrs now. I was just stsrting to live life then. I hit up every club in Atlanta (accept 559) I was bad bad  but, sexy-classy. Real hair was like them chicks wigs today... hair did, nails did, everybody tryin' to get some of what you got ☺️ the life
What an entertainer! 💯
6:50 Oh is that why?!?! I've always wondered about that😂😅
🥰😍🤩
Coming back months later to rewatch.
Why would they have this dude on in tiny desk lol
The intro horns makes me feel so welcomed!
Tribe called  Wuest minus phife RIP up next

Dang best one yet tbh 😅🔥🔥🔥
🥰😍🤩❣
Tiny Desk y'all need to come out with a full album with these different artist cause I sure will buy this in a heartbeat 🔥🔥🗣🔥🔥🔥🔥

@nprmusic  please please 🙏🏾 do Project Pat and the 3 6 !!!
The 400 Degrees intro impeccably drops 0:49 every time, it never disappoints.
This was crazy  Juvenile definitely one of the greats
Who’s here after Eva from Abbott Elementary lol
Who’s the band?
Man….listen
I don’t care if I’m at the office I would’ve been THROWING 🍑🍑🍑
Been listening to this every morning since day1 !

Back Again
🥰🥰🥰⚜️ Yes, Mr. Juvie aka Big Daddy when you back that jazz up!!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉😅 because you got ten years on me. Lol
This has to be on vinyl. Bruh… 🎉
When you listen to music produced by old school guys like Manny Fresh You can really see the higher levels of creativity and quality compared to todays rap producers
Class of 2007 up in this MF!
This put the biggest smile on my face😊 Gotta love Juve and Mannie
Futuramas' prediction of rap music becoming the future's classical music is this!
I certainly hope that you know NOLA was well represented here:  I’ve only listened to this 30x or more…love how much of a good time was had here, still feeling this 2/4/2024!
John Batiste sneaking THE Lick in 23:10

Best Tiny Desk Ever

This is healing for Millennials ❤
NPR for the win!
I use to wish we was related. ❤Manny and Juvy.❤
This still makes me smile!
Prime New Orleans
Would love to see Wayne do a tiny desk
How did they get mike Epps to do this? Just playing juvi the man.
This was so hot. One of my favorites.
That was Impressive!🔥🔥
this was actually the hardest tiny desk to date and I watch them all of all genres. Gary clark jr was also super good but this was just unexpectedly amazing. The band, performers,  production is sick and Juvy is a savage
Smart choice to bring this legend on the show. ❤
This and Scarface are my two favourite TD performances
❤❤❤love this performance I got a chance to see him live and I’m just excited to see this performance and he had real live strings yyyyyaaaaasssss….
A WHOLE VIBE
Dig it
I keep coming back!!!

Four hundred degrees Please
"That was Dat nerve, huh" Ayyeee. This was my day... I'm 44 years old and I came up in the best time with the best music. This was comedy and therapy all in one 😂.
Juvie so SEXY!!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤
This is so dope
I was recently at a music festival in Dallas, and everyone gets energetic when they hear juvenile! This was heart warming 💗
He performs really good. Stay hype.. I went to his concert last year..
Sooooo good
Bout to go to all these songs when i leave here. And the ones they didn't perform. This is, literally, a childhood soundtrack!!
The ONLY thing that would've made this better is if Wayne and BG would've pulled up ⚜️⚜️⚜️⚜️
This that NOLA Gen X shyt! 🔥⚜️🔥⚜️
How would I book for my baby shower 🤣like seriously
It's just beautiful to see humans enjoying themselves from time to time
The best!!!
So great
💣
And he did it all in sandals 😂
oh snap, is that mannie by his side?
The bass player def grew up playing bass in the church, because his facial expressions are killing me 😂
So so goooood!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥x100

I love Manny fresh because his spirit is always happy I have never ever seen him mad he is always smiling
Juvie had the best verse on project chick. Explicit version 🔥
Lol aye i bet he da coolest grandpa on earth
Juvee sound good!
Imagine a DMX TinyDesk. Sad never happened.
I love these guys. They looked so full of joy.
Manny Fresh's voice is so smooth. Juvenille kills it, but Manny is the MVP of this show imo.
I was feeling sick but when I heard this walk down memory lane I smiled so hard and felt better ❤ thank you tiny desk
❤
Thank you so much for this! I am going to listen to this one thousand times.

This is the best anti-depressant IN MY LIFE! Thank you Juvenile, Manny Fresh, Trombone Shorty, jean Baptiste, the singers, instrumentalists, DJ - Tiny Desk!   THANK YOU!
I love that he brought out Trombone Shorty!  I got to see him at the ATL Jazz Festival back in the day
As someone who hated rap for the past 20 years, this is the sht. 😍
I literally watch this everyday please convert this into an album
Best NPR him and Scarface
Fresh needs his spotlight. This might be a crazy thought to put out there but, there is no Juvenile without Weezy and also there is no Weezy without Juvenile. Manny made them both reach/realise their potential.
Ouuuuuuuu🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
My favorite of all times ❤❤❤❤❤❤ the original Hott girl Detroit finest 🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️💪💪💪
Charlie Wilson , Jivie and Scarface have been the best at Tiny desk
JUVIE ripped tiny desk wide open
Happy Music!🎉🍾
This was amazing you could tell the crowd was feeling it too 💯🔥
Juvenile is really different!!!! Nostalgia at it's finest 80's babies know!!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉 Oh what a time! 💐💐💐💐
It Is that a Victoria ?
941 min is super  dope !
Am I the only one who was waiting for “till then ima be thuggn behind that project building smoking that fire I’m with the ghetto children, Larrd!”
his brotha rapping sound like polished version of jay z! fantastic!
Happy to see Juvenile still doing his thing, and doing it well. He looks and sounds great!
remember being 15-16 spitting the lyrics of this with my mate with frank jez in some underground radio station late 90's
Rappers these days can’t match this rhythm and energy
God dang man, love this
The crowd ain’t hyped enough for me  Yall better get with it that’s JUVENILE 🥰
100% a straight female (using my guys’s name) BUT THESE BACKUP SANGERS…. They’re too beautiful!! Omg
I keep watching this over & over I can’t help myself 😂🙏🏿
Awesome! They should make a new album of off this

This tiny desk should be a PODCAST ALREADY
Yo they started off w the intro to 400 degreez?? That's toughhh. Ain't even 5 seconds in yet and have to keep rewinding.
Where all the white women at??
This was so good! Juvenile definitely needs to do a Broadway show!
The best one yet!!!
❤

Girls been backin it up ever since..Thank you Juvenile. Thank you ladies. 🫡
That was nostalgic 😊
Classic 💯
Mannie the goat
Can’t beat this one. By far, in my opinion, the best Tiny Desk performance yet and likely to follow. Great job, blazing hot energy, well placed line-up alongside some very talented musicians. I just wish he woulda “Run Forest, run Forest, run!!! Juve the Great, for sure.
Best performance the only one I have watched more than once.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Looking back, the last 8 minutes of this was my favorite musical moment of 2023.
Okay JUVENILE killed the game on the "Tiny Desk" by bringing John Batiste. This shows no matter the music ....it's all culture to some degree❤😂🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😮
tink Desk can we get a Bg one
"Head behind the builddddunn"
Rewatching this one more time before 2024 kicks in!!!

🔥🔥🔥🤟🏾
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
my favourite one for real
I love my people❤❤
The ending of this is just pure magic
This tiny desk is one for the books‼️ Juvie is one of the greatest rappers of all time, especially from the south, N.O. L.A., USA.
One verse of slow motion that’s whack that my joint
Bro has an extra lung someplace
Juve always been a dope artist lets give this man his flowers while his legacy lives on. Hip Hop greatness..
Yo NOLA Goated 😂😂😂 🔥
This real Southern style music I'm from Texas and juvenile one my favorite southern father 👑👑💯
🔥 📛 👨‍🚒 🚒 🧯
Juvi!!!  CMB4Life
I couldn’t stop laughing when they started singing project b*tch 🤣 it sound like a nursery rhyme and was 🔥🔥🔥
16:55 Shout out to all my _Cash Money Millionaires_ who know more about that verse (such as the original artist, and the pop culture references).
This is my new favorite Tiny Desk Concert
Definitely top 5 tiny desk concerts
That set it of beat gon always remind me of UNLV THO
Legit goofy smiling through the whole thing I loved this so much 😂❤
I thought they broke juvie off with 15-20 years in prison. Glad to see him out.
Rodeo set was perfect 😮‍💨🥹🔥
18:55 The guy in green is having the time of his life. It's cracking me up 😂
We love you Juvi and Mannie Fresh!!!!
🥶 🥶 🥶
I love it my favorite boys them hot boys😍🔥🔥🫶
I got an all new respect for Juvi.
Southern rap above all
Yall will never know the magnitude of JUVE’s 400 Degrees 🔥🔥🔥🔥 you had to be there !!!! Luv this nostalgia.
LIKE how the snuck jon batiste in there
This shyt went HARD AF PLAYA
This literally made me smileeeeee
Stoolpurger calls the singer ,,he’s an 8
If you was born 1977 ❤
Even the people there in the crowd felt the vibe . This was mint 👌
I CAN"T STOP REPLAYING THIS, HELP
Maddddddd concert 🔥
Juv mad but mannni crazy making  beat like nothing ….. 🔥🎶
Dope and fun! Awesome!
HeyyyyyJuvenileeeee❤💯💯💯💯❤ boiii me and my girls use to come out the club sweating 😓 😅😅😅 from dancing so hard, hair messed up and everything 😅😅😅
***JuVvvY***One of the Best Performances on the NPR SET besides Scarface***
This was the best crowd I’ve seen
Sounds better than the official release
not the most complex lyrics but Juvenile has crazy breath control
Yes.
For the culture!!
Great great energy 🎉🔥🔥🔥
Rodeo
The Ol Drag em to the river on set it off hollering oh
This is fire!!! Music was banging, especially the Grammy award winning Christmas present player
🗣This was classic I jus wish there were more audience reactions. Str8 Gold tho Hotboys front & center We need tha Reunion Huh Wayne ,Turkey ,B.G, Juvie let's make haste time is of tha essence🎧
Yes indeed!!!!
This is so dope I play this at BBQs and party's with older people there ❤
Mannie Fresh don’t age lol 😂
It really doesn’t get much better than this, he had a great time which made it even better.  FUN!
I love them so much
Can hear the legend lyrics
I’ve seen many good Tiny Desk’s in my day, but this one, this one had me smiling ear to ear the whole time. The energy, instruments, Mannie and Juv. Took me back! Every second was memorable.  I owned every single group and every solo album from Big Tymer, Hot Boyz, Juv, Wayne, Mannie, BG and even ole Birdman. Collected from ‘98 thru mid/late ‘00’s. Mannies beats had my subs begin’ for mercy back in the day. Good memories from this. Rodeo was really moving, probably one of my faves of Juvenile’s, but there’s so many hits though cant put one above the other, like “Nola Clap” he did with UTP.  Mannie’s the best hype man/ DJ, he owned the ‘00’s. Plus shout out to the band that came together. T. Shawdy, the Amours and the members of the LA. Philharmonic. Glad Juv and Mannie are doing good and had a blast. Thanks Tiny Desk @ NPR for another great one.   PS: I was actually watching the Big Tymers video last night “#1 Stunna,” thinkin’ about the good ole days and someone in the comments mentioned Juv’s T. Desk. low and behold it was right below so I checked it out this morning.  Late, but never absent.  Rip Solja Slim & Mr. Magic. Everyone giving homage wearing Slim’s brown suit and camo hat!   PSS: Juv, Wayne, BG need a HotBoyz album produced by Mannie now that BG is free. Lastly, Free Corey Miller. ✌️
Tiny Dest is the best!!!!
Mannie needs to get in shape
When ratchet and class clash. Beautiful
Thank you juve. That was dope af
NOLA MUSIC only can take bounce turn into a jazz sound!!  Too easy. Live instrumens with juvenile & Mani fresh is a trip. A bit off beat but thats okay... bounce is hard to use instruments.. audience did a good job. & the girls too was an old school cut.
I WANT TO SEE THE HOT BOYS AT THE SUPERBOWL HALF TIME SHOW 💯 💪🏿💪🏿 REAL TALK I WISH THEY WOULD ALL GET BACK TOGETHER OR JUVIE AND MANNY TO DUPLICATE THE FANTASTIC SHOW AT THE SUPERBOWL HERE, I LOVE YOUR LANE JUVIE .. GOOD MUSIC IS TIMELESS AND SO ARE YOU!!!!
Real talk juvi I like how the desk concert always jumpin but rite in the front shot u got mad books and all the vinyl in da back so dope.😮
😎👍
He's better than lil Wayne to me
5:55 to 7:45: The most entertaining part of the performance, and one of my fave Tiny Desk moments. Sometimes songs take on a different life on TD, this is up there with Carseat Headrest's Drum, more enjoyable here over the album cut.
This been a musician and a producers dream to see and hear.. Cash Money was not sampling any beats back then...
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Love ❤Juve
This set goes dumb hard 🎉
“My 9 is gonna ride with meeee…..pick up the supply with meee….”
Best NPR yet!!! 🙌🏽💪🏽
Fantastic
Tiny desk is hard

Hands down best tiny desk concert ever!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
This will be remembered forever
Don't get me wrong I love Juvie.  But I thought I would hear Funky fingers when he did 400 degrees.  That musician made that album special.

Mal chic
This is awesome, the Morres are great, Juve and Manny ❤️🖤💚✊🏾
The peak. The pinnacle.
🔥
I’m from New Orleans and when I was a teenager this was all we listen too go awf juvi
By far my favorite TD.. Juvi and Fresh still rocking crowds out here!!  They could take this set all over the world!!
Cash money boyzzzzzzzzzzzzzz  one love from Nigeria.
Juvenile understood the assignment.. being willing to do a back to back encore of his most successful song speaks volumes about how cool and down to earth this man is.. doesn't take himself too seriously, happy to please the crowd because he's secure with his place in the history of hip hop.. he could have forced deeper cuts into the setlist but he said nah, I'm gonna give the people what they know even if they don't know they already know.. Seriously brilliant the way he played this. Juvenile a real one.
I love so many different aspects of this performance  but I REALLY loved watching the musicians faces from time to time.  They were almost in disbelief like “Is this a dream? I can’t believe we really get to do this!” Amazing job by everyone involved from the performers to the videographers, to the crowd, to everyone behind the scenes that quietly helped make this magic happen!❤🙌🏿🙏🏿
You can see how real Juvenile feels this is.
Real Bars... ya heard
Bassist check in that bass though! And the keys 🎹 whole video Mannie Fresh top producers mt Rushmore Juvi remind of me of my cool a$$ uncles
They really turned this into a party. This tiny desk was 🔥 Also Mannie Fresh is an underrated hype man/producer
Buddy put the silencer on the trumpet for slow motion
Manny Fresh as a Muh
Awesome!😊
So dope!! 🔥🔥🔥
This was dope
Yep I’m back lol. My favorite
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Juvie is hot tho
I love this album
I love that you can see everyone in the band and the crowd is just feeling it and loving his energy!
Hands down… best Tiny Desk!
I’ve watched every day. So good!
They tried it over here...
Wished juvenile did “I need it in my life”
I was like 14 or 15 when they hit the scene. And a part of the original twerking generation. So, yeah. This is a whole happy place for me...
Probably the best tiny desk concert. Juvie so real and raw. Manny Fresh is the man. This is hip hop
This should make everyone realize how BAD we need a HotBoys Reunion in 2024!!! BG is home now! Turk. Juvie. Wayne!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
lyrics dirty ash but my head is bopping 😭
Juvenile sounds like a pastor singin dirty songs... nice
I love all the tiny desk concerts ❤❤🎉😂😅😊
I need to go to one of these concerts! Would be a dream come true
This was awesome 😮
Can’t stop watching juvenile tiny desk concert the best tiny desk concert 👍🏽
Set it off is that jam!!! Love manny fresh!!!
My life is complete now. I can die a happy man. I’ve been listening to Juvie and Manny fresh since HS. This is absolutely amazing! ❤️
Real rap. Real music. Real performers. 90s Rap hands down the best.
He needs to carry this team with him where ever he go. They GOLD.
WHERE IS TURK!!!???😫😫😫
Back that a$$ up is one of the best music videos of early 2000s prove me wrong !
This could be a whole sold out concert in NOLA no cap!
Man shout my city NOLA!! Who else sang this video word for word!
Stretch them glutes
That was amazing! 504!!! This music really feels like home for me and I appreciate them doing an excellent job at it.
Manny Fresh made Cash Money... Period!!!
CATALOG
We workin for NPR Naw...Relegated to Classical Muzik Hawn
Can we get Boosie
⚜️⚜️⚜️
Gotta' see Mystikal on Tiny Desk
I only watched this Tiny Desk a couple times now. I need to figure out how to download the audio or something.
I always get goosebumps  at the end of the video when Mannie Fresh goes to the crowd 26:15  and make music and dance with em - u can really see that everyone was absolutely energized by the music Greetings from Germany!!! I love it
The first Tiny Desk Concert I like.
20:02
This was really really good. Such a unique take on these tracks honestly.
If this aint a hot set then what do you call that?
No Wayne?
The people need more!
One of my all time favorite NPR tiny desk concerts… the energy and the authenticity is incredible.
Classic i love it
I’m getting the chills bruhhh
THA MFKING LEGENDS OF DA BOOT my whole entire 8th grade year in Middle school boi!
This was a really good concert at Tiny Desk by Juvenile and Mannie Fresh this was so tuff that it was good enough for a crowd of about between 30,000 - 100,000 people but I will just say this but he needed to change up the N word  there at Tiny Desk now at a stadium or a Venue with about between 3 - 4 groups other groups you already know that he's going to use those but anyway Juvenile is one of the Top 2 or 3 Rappers still left a live in the world and Mannie Fresh is in my opinion number 1 with the Beats in the world so Tiny Desk scored Bigger than than ever thought with those 2 African American brothers or Black men because some people like to be called African Americans and some like to be called Black men so Congratulations to Tiny Desk.
Juvy doing an encore with Mannie Fresh joining the TDC crowd signing along is exactly what I needed.
Ima huge Tedeschi trucks band fan, but I’m not sure which Tiny desk performance I like more. Juvenile v. Tedeschi trucks band.
Jon Batiste and Trombone Shorty never thought they'd be playing Project B*&ch 🤣🤣🤣
20:20
Top tier! Can’t wait to revisit in the future!
This is the best Tiny Desk Concert!! What is Juve drinking
GO HEAD, MANY..... YOU GOT THEN A MO FUCER. REAL TALK !!!!!
This now my favorite one I love tiny desk
This is so legendary it’s incredible how many of the younger will never know.
Lord have mercy, this was old school for this old fool.
Alexa, play club hits for people over 40
Im back again. 😂😂
I can’t get enough of this
He did wonderful they all did Thanks so much for this
Juvenile aged Gracefully
This was simply beautiful! Took me back to my middle and high school days. When rap was rap and wasn't auto tuned and mumbled. Man, I miss these days 😪.
I love that he mentioned Turk! Turk is another one who lowkey deserves his flowers 💯❤️
I can’t even the count the times…the intro sucks me in EVERY time… the best 28 min ever. 😅
T 26:19 🎉his Caught 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 What is real is real foreva
Gotta be real. I had no idea that many Black people worked at NPR!! 😂😂😂😂
❤❤❤
This is my high school years my formative years so to speak….we loved Cash Money with all our beings…this brings a tear to my eye….😢
This is probably my fourth time watching this tiny desk all the way through and it just gets better overtime🎉🎉.
So good!
Tiny Desk Concerts taking over for the 99 and the 2000s
This is one of the best if not THE  BEST Tiny Desk Concert I’ve seen. Juvie still got it 🔥 This was a vibe ‘99/‘00
They still got it!!!!!!!❤❤
This is amazing best tiny desk of 2023
This was great!!!
This is amazing… better then the originals
Came here straight from an Adam Neely discussion about jazz. He played about 3 seconds of this Tiny Desk and that was enough for me.  This has some REAL energy. Nice work.
Baptiste!!!!!!🎉🎉🎉❤
This was the best tiny desk concert
No auto tune real music
The live instruments add a lot of energy to an already great set.
MANNIE 💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞
Strings: “Mom, Dad I got the greatest opportunity EVER!” Parents: “Tell us about it!” Strings: “We’re playing in the band for Juveniles’ Back that Az up!” Parents: “We are so proud of you!”
Def didn’t have Mannie Fresh on my Tiny Desk bingo card
Unc nem rocked out boa
Wow. Out of all the tiny desk I vibed with this the most. Great job
Top tier!!!!!
Here I am.. again 😂  This help me turn my swag on in the morning
Slow motion hit different 🔥
Best one yet! Takes me back to when rap was goooood! Everything made sense and made ya feel good! Thanks NPR for this!
Props to you juvenile!!.. for giving, putting striving musicians on the map!...💜💜💜💜💜😢💜💜💜💜💜💜💜 for prosperity ,re😮cognition ,talent and quality of the arts and skill... GOD BLESS YOU!!!
Im digging the tiny desk videos. Where are they held? I want to attend
This needs an orchestra!!
20:00
I’m not being dramatic when I say this changed my life
Ok green shirt 😉
This is the gift I didn’t know I needed
That just made my whole day!
So good!
I miss the cash money crew 😭😭
The chemistry between Juve & Mannie fresh & the whole live band was impeccable. They all flowed, supported each other so well, & had fun with it. I heard someone say Juve didn’t want to perform here at first, but obviously all of them came together & created art. This is the best live performance I’ve seen from anyone in years.
Best tiny desk?
👏👏👏👏 Bravo!
I have a Idea Juvenile and Mexican Ot   Song?
Ngl I'm single handedly responsible for like 1000 views lol  This set is straight up fire 🔥
Came back to enjoy the ratchet goodness lol. I still think Ghetto Children woulda been absolutely PERFECT for the Tiny Desk, but I guess there was copyright issues. But that’s on track itself, not a live performance, where they coulda remixed it a lil!!
His breath control is honestly amazing.
Jon batiste with the lick at the end
Yooo they slayed this
There’s one huge problem with this, it ain’t long enough!! Still got nothing but love for this set!
20:00 🫡
Mannie getting in the crowd was fireeee❤❤❤🎉😂😂
This is still amazing 😭
Best tiny desk ever!!!
This was the best one HANDS DOWN
This is phenomenal. Seriously best tiny desk concert in years 👏👏👏
Ross said it the best, if the music don't give you a feeling or goosebumps when you hear it then it's not good music
i don’t remember the last time i smiled this much
One the best ones yet 😊
THANK YOU
The best tiny desk concert
Cancert of the year ✌️
Thank You Family  Honestly for all Your Love....etc Unofficial
ABSOLUTELY SHOWSTOPPING
I miss hip hop😢
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is my favorite,I play this a few times a week.
I love how music transcends all barriers — all walks of life just vibin
Absolutely great! Love every bit of it!
We need a tiny desk with the Ying Yang Twins 😭 this was perfect!
Como se extraña este feeling en la musica en lo general. Animo !!!
That was so good, took me way back to high school!
I think watching this once a week will keep me from getting Seasonal affective disorder this year
madooooooo
This is everything❤🎉
cello man 🙂
Best tiny desk
"We on the positive Vibes..."   - Juvenile  🙏
4th time today happy Thanksgiving you all!
This is the one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 🔥 I’m STILL here , 4 months later 😩😩🙏🏽
I Just jammed like I was in my prime and that was decades ago,Straight fire.
Louisiana finest.
Ratchet Elegancia😂
I was in the 8th grade when a lot of his  songs was popular…god music was great in 99/00!
Still coming back babies ❤🎉
Ayyyyeeeee!!!!!
STRAIGHT FIRE!!!!! 💯💣💥
This is an NPR classic! From Brooklyn with love to NOLA ✅💯💪🏾
I was on mushrooms as a kid when Ha came out,i said ha after everything no bs😂😂😅😢😢😅😅😅
Outcast should do this
These Nawlins boyz just built different ✊🏿
This tiny desk is chefs kiss
When Juvie said “To make Nothing out of something,” … I felt that
Man I had no idea this cat was THIS good wow!!
I watch this like once a month, it needs to nominated some sort of award
This is up there with Big daddy Kane what a performance
This man has hits that have lasted the test of time and the energy he had in the room is crazy and to me Juvenile is a legend in hip hop and deserves more credit as a MC. And on a side note I have a you tube channel type in Russell Mills May 22, 2017 to find me.
❤❤❤
"I NEED YALL TO GET REAL ATHLETIC!"
Coming back again
So talented and love how fun they are to watch.
New Orleans Brass Bands and the vibes!
Why nobody challenged Juvie in a versus 🤷🏾….this the answer 💯
This dope takes me back to 1999
🤪🎉🎉🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
You know it’s good when you got the NPR staff participating too
Beat sound like it's off golden eye on 64
Wow bravo!!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Want much of a fan, until now! Wow what a performance!
Manny Fresh is always smiling with good vibes and his beats are always on fire! I've seen a lot of scenes of Juvenile and Manny Fresh together lately and they seem to really get along. People hate him but I wish Birdman would get back together and work with them again. I love Big Tymers!
When he brought in the dern strings😂😂💜💚💛
This is the best thing thing I've ever watched
Mannie fresh and juvenile need to do a concert fr fr. Still  hot boyz!!
All black men musicians 🔥🔥🔥❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Insanely good, probably my 10th listen
Im here because of My First Million podcast! I have always been a fan of juvenile but this here is a masterpiece! Literally a personal performance almost in celebration of his success of his music! Least thats what it felt like to me! Reminds me of a going away party when a coworker is leaving to go to another job! Lol
Tiny Desk please add time stamps for us poor dear fans
Whoday!!! This ain't fully legit until all the HotBoyz are on this concert. Bring em back, bring em back, bring em back
Thank you NPR
Was not expecting the encore glad Juve got his flowers he deserves it
😮😮😮😮 BRILLIANT!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 still a master of his craft we need mystikal next
This is one of the best tiny desk performances
I love it ❤
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Please lets not miss that Jon and Shorty did not need to be there but came through just to support these pioneers of music.  Good move❤❤
Been a fan
Listen this so cold I just can’t get over how Mannie look like my one auntie
That song you keep good work bro
Juvie is real AF
His voice sounds exactly the same.
Louisiana stand up💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
Legendary performance from 2 of the greatest 💯💯🍾🍾
Tiny desk is the ISH!!!! great quality and selection of artists. May I recommend Busta Rhymes? Please!!!!

They need outkast next
Yess.....it was Manny for me ❤
I've watched this so many times, but when he says "AHN- Coh" the already high energy, gets higher for me. Encore should have had 3 more songs in it, lol
Now who's going to top this ?
They killed it
Never knew I needed a Juvenile live concert in my life
3:48 is my favorite part of all of this and was my fave part of bling bling 25 years ago when I was like 8
Mannie seems like he is the best kind of energy to have around. Amazing performance.
Rip 🪦 magnolia Slim, a.k.a. Soulja Slim

This can go down in history as a MASTERPIECE 🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

My favorite tiny desk ever.
One of the tiny desks that I want to see the crowd dialing it in to slow motion.
Saving this.  Crazy good set . This easily made it to my top tiny desk performance. Juvy thank you for the fire.
Back on assignment  400degresssnounetcuno

Growing up around this music and watching this brought me back to simpler times. Got my heart smiling. Thank you tiny desk 🥺
No puedo creer que nunca había escuchado de él, gracias Tiny, como siempre :)
Mannie Fresh is so so Fresh. Brought back so many good memories.
This was 2023 perfection ❤❤
The joy on juvenile face says it all
I didn’t understand when people said they went back to tiny desk concerts and rewatched them… until this one.  I think I’ve watched it three times today so far.
So cool
I just can't get enough of this funky cool jazzy version of Juvenile's music. Absolutely sublime. 🤌💯
one of the best tiny desk performances ever 🔥🔥🔥🔥 would love to see lil wayne on here one day too
Lord these CANT be the same lyrics I was singing at 7 😂😂😂😂😂
Juve is that one uncle in the family!
Me: HUNH 🗣️🗣️🗣️
The BEST concert I’ve been to
Who say I smokn mariwaannnuh? She get it from her momma!
Did we break the comments section? This is my 20th watch and the same comments are here as the first or second time. Why are no new comments showing up as the views increase a million a week? Stop playing YouTube! Haters. Team Juvie and Mannie Fresh over here! 🙌🏾❤‍🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
My favorite one ❤
Project B was my jam way back when I was younger. I remember asking for the cash money millionaires tape specifically for this song for my birthday, and yes! I said tape lol.
They brought that ENERGY. Manny really got the crowd going for that encore
Amazing
I love that NPR do these concerts ❤
Please the Black month bs, black history month our place in history is far greater than a month a year or 1,000s of years
Nipsey on the keys!
I graduated in 99...when I tell you every morning before school and after school we were blasting Juvy and P.... Fine ace😍💗💗💗💗👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
Still here
Is 1st guy related to Jay z lol
Juvi had so many hits its crazy.

1000💯🎶🎙️🔥🔥🔥 New Orleans 4Life💯 Lafayette, 4thWard.🤘🏾🤴🏾🎶🎙️🔥🔥 Mastonchada Trill
Forgot how many good songs juvenile had.
HIP HOP at it’s finest 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯
This was the ish!
This was truly a flowers moment, I think many of us had either forgotten or grossly underestimated Juvenile's and Mannie Fresh contribution to both hip hop and music in general.
😃🔥🔥🔥
Incredible!
This really blew my mind, thank you NPR.
Juve My Favorite Saw Him Live In Mississippi And I Caught A Towel From Him So 🔥
this is my 5th time watching this
that would have been smooth if B.G and wayne  had of came out at  back that az up'
perfect Tiny Desk to listen to while getting ready for work!!👏👏👏👏👏 Juuuvaaaaaay!
Abraham be so proud of neglect to precursors of juneteenth
9:25 Crowd swaying like they're singing Christmas Carrols...
Not jon baptiste 👀👀👀👀
Bruhhh I’m back.  It’s just so good. And love they added Jon baptist
Yea juvenile 😊
Gotta make an acoustic album.. he got the vocals to do it
I'm so happy to see more of Juvenile and Mannie Fresh. Their music is fantastic. When these two come together it's over. Great concert❤❤😎 😎
Either hip hop with jazz elements, or jazz with hip hop elements??, and an exciting band.
This was so ghettoly and ratchetly satisfying 🙌🏾 One of the best Tiny Desks I have ever watched!
this has to be the best tiny desk performance
wow. that was so GOOD! sitting at my tiny desk in Brooklyn had me boppin' my head and clapping all bymyself. thanks NPR!!
I wanted to be a Hot Boy because of this Man JUVY that was guy living on the Southside of Chicago
"Attitude adjustments; we all need" - As true now as it was then.
Juvenile and Mannie Fresh are really good Rappers but I was shocked that they were using the N- Word and that there were white people in the audience and that NPR was okay with it I'm going to have to lose a lot of respect for NPR for this one because I didn't know that until the Camera panned over to the audience and Juvenile and Mannie Fresh are supposed to be smarter men than that so I'm going to have to take some points from them as well.
I've watched a lot of TDC and Juve and crew had the absolute most fun of anyone I've seen, and therefore, we all had fun!
Juvenile never lost his shine ✨
둘 다 나이드니까 오히려 훈남됐음
🫡😂❤👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Ayeee😂👏👏👏
They snapped!!! So much nostalgia!
The guy in the green shirt gave me life 🎉 This performance was gold. Thank you Juvenile for being you
This tiny desk gave me CHILLS! Omg!
love it!
I literally was smiling the whole time listening to this. I would listen to a whole album like this 💯
Well done Ju-Ve!!!
Black People truly are a gift ti the world. so talented.
Juvenile Mannie fresh music is legendary and timeless🔥🔥🔥🔥
Thank Black Twitter for making it happen & Juvenile participation 😁
Man, I was smiling throughout the whole performance. This brought me back so many good memories, coming to the US from Cuba and not knowing a word of English to instantly vibing to Big Tymers and Juvenile. Good times. 🥹
They should come out with a new album, they are awesome. My all time favorite, miss y'all, we need y'all.💯💪
I love this, everyone was truly awesome.
WOW! 😊
please raise the mic a little in the mix.
DANG JUVIE? That dude been around fo ever! COME PLAY AUSTIN like Stubb's. Me and my people there front row, sir.
Juve got hits for days!!!
Mannie with that live "ughhh" on set it off
They look they’re having so much fun
Back for the 20th time
U know bruv having some back pain from all those shorties backing that thang up lol
😊😅😂❤
Best TDC rap appearance! Big boi was also great!
Tiny Desk/NPR thank u thank u thank u.  This is true art and talent
These views would go up by the day upon the release date of the HotBoy Reunion dates.
These females voices are wow.
One of the most motivational songs ever.
🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥
Back when talent was a thing in the art of music, including rap.  You just don't get this anymore = /.
EPIC!
It's only right Manny Fresh is right by his brother Juvi's side. These OGs from the south had a California latino fully immersed in their campaign from the cars to the white tees, the diamonds, I was sold on becoming rich.
That boy mannie talkin bout "this the greatest love song ever wrote" ,im joked out😁
Mmannn i help his son kevon get in nave i read all book also quizz them mannn get himm and his veil mommaxxxxno why before he hurt again  lil children nojoke
“GREATEST LOVE SONG EVER WROTE!!!”
Top 3 tiny desk consert hands down
I had to watch!!
Bro sounds exactly like the recording 20 years later, yall put some respekt on juve
This was an awesome set. The beginning arrangement how it all went right into it...
you got a lot of girbaud jeans ha  that line took me all the way back to 92 in detroit
Ok....soòoooo im back 🤷🏽‍♀️
Awsome!❤
Update: I come back to this tiny desk atleast 3x a week for a dose of good vibes! I need Juvie to bring Mannie Fresh and this band on the road ASAP! 😂❤
Can someone tell me what the name of the band is?
This is the most amazing thing I've ever seen 😭
Best tiny desk ever! Post Malone did a good one but I grew up with these songs. I remember when 400 degreez came out. I just hope they will get Busta in the tiny desk. When disaster strikes throwbacks.
🔥🔥🔥
"we be making hits yeah after hits yeah" was everything
This might be one of the best ones they did !
😂
iwish Lil Wayne could have made
Scarface Brad Jordan deserves a tiny desk!!! He plays all instruments too
I can feel how authentic this performance is. however I hate that I cant appreciate the art cos I am not familiar with the music🥲🥲😭
This is gold 🌟🔥
I take basic music but catchy 😢
🔥🔥🔥🔥
I finally understood every word he said😅😅   But seriously,  that was unbelievably good . Whoever was in the audience that day got a classic performance.. !!!!!!
God Bless the person who said one more time!
This was the most lit one you can tell they had fun l
Omg I LUV HIM

You can't help but smile while watching. 😊
Never heard a bigger load of rubbish In my life ...call that music or even talent is a joke
I know it wasn’t one of his main songs but it would have been nice to hear “Sets Go Up” from Need for speed Most Wanted 05 on a Tiny Desk set
VIBES AND VIBES AND MORE VIBES!

Sea red. Black 400 temperature too high madifrassz remember 400 degrees
Goal: be as happy as Juvie and Mannie when they were performing. That was beautiful!
Mannie being there took this to the next level
Cash money messed up when thay let Manny Fresh walk out the door

This needs to be a Broadway musical
Turk part the best

43 years old and will forever be a juvenile fam. Not interested in ANY new music 😂
The fact that 400 degrees was first  💯
Love it.  Real boys know.
This was really tight by Juvenile and Manny Fresh and friends i was surprised at NPR but this was a great Concert i don't always agree with NPR but this was off the chain meaning really great so a really Big Thumbs up who put this together great job.
JUVE!  Top Energy!
Started this thing with 400 degreez. To this day that’s my favorite hip hop album 🔥🔥
Can’t compare this sound ..thank you

So impressive what a pure performer Juve knocked it out.
SLAPS!!
Love this! ❤❤
Ain't loss a step...and I COMPLETELY enjoyed the BET Hip Hop Awards 2023 since Juvie n Manny showed up to remind the ones tht unfortunately don't know any better where there style came from....Remind em of the roots, Creole, Gulley,  Geechee, & every person of melanin descent in between....And im a band geek too...Lets go horns n harmony
This hit sumthin different in me....being a mature woman born in the 1900s....the ENTIRE HOT BOYZ movement took me to roots I didn't even k ow I hd...And I ❤ em all 4 it...those present & not present....Da *ish just gets better...the deeper roots, da better da soil....and this is just a one of the many Plants in can grow...Thank u, thank u, thank u.....❤😘💯💋

Scott bradlee's post modern jukebox basically. And they killed it!
Mannie Fresh’s voice sounds similar to Jay-Z
YouTubes double standard censoring
Now, we WHITE, music month!

New school artist.. Take notes ! NOLA Legends ! Boot Up !
It was a love song tho 😂😂😂
🔥🔥🔥💯💯
Why do lots rappers who started in the 90s and 2000s had very deep hardcore rough accents for their age. Like Juvenile on his first album, he sounded 30 years old and he was only like 23/24 years old. Then you have rappers like Kendrick Lamar, J-Cole, YG etc who have like slightly slurred mumble pop style pitch flows and it sounds like a teenager rapping. Like it ain’t as hardcore/rough in your face deep accent. Like is it something to do with the style of how hip hop is made now or the way it’s mixed and mastered now or do rappers don’t wanna do those style of flows anymore? Idk I’m just generally curious because I just noticed it when I listen to a lot of understand or mainstream stuff from the old days, like rappers sounded and looked older then their age and had more raw aggressive or deep voices.
The musicianship was superb. Ngl I was looking at bass and keys the whole time. 👀👀👀
Cool to see a different side of some of these artists !
NPR is just the best all around. Let's make sure they stay funded!
"Mmm I'm a 1999 driver" ❤❤❤
I think its one of the best TDCs, instant classic! They totally took me by surprise to have a TD performance with Juve - so many childhood memories dancing to his songs - and then they executed it...like this!!!❤ This video always puts a smile on me, everytime!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👏
The best tiny desk ever... Might even be the greatest one 💯💯
Too beautiful
400 degrees is amazing !
This tiny desk made me happy for some reason. I’m also a street guy who changed his life who was a kid when this stuff came out.
Can't lie, this is probably the best tiny desk. Such fire songs and energy. This is classic
The magnoliaaaaaaaaaaaa home of the soliders
I love the musicians' expressions! Aye aye 😊
The best performance I can remember!
Soundtrack to my life early 2000s juvi the great
How's he look so young
Prob on my 10th or so listen
Straight 🔥
Surprisingly good.  Love me some Juvenile!
The brass in the background added some extra spice 🔥🔥
The Tiny Desk Concert you didn't know you needed! 🔥
Still coming back to watch...epic!❤
I used to love this when I was a kid. Nah I see it has poisoned the blk community. It's garbage 🗑 😢

Fjj
I can’t even explain the happiness this gives me! I got goosebumps like crazy and just can’t stop smiling! A million thank yous to you all! Please make this an album please!!!
Why does the channel have to keep the N word in the set?  I am so disappointed - especially after finding the channel after Sam Smith.
Music like this is one in million, can’t be replicated!
Need to get Nelly on here.
Tiny desk really collecting the best performers and artists
First time in NPR history they asked for an encore. Best performance yet.
We need Three 6 Mafia next!

Do one with Webbie!
Juvenile is one of the Hip Hop greats. He deserves a place in the Pantheon next to 2Pac, Biggie, Public Enemy, Eminem, Busta and all masters that changed the game in the 90s.
One of the ones I just really keep going back to besides the Mac Miller one. The energy here is just incredible. Thanks for making these happen!!

I mean Wow! I really did enjoy this. I was a Juvenile fan back in the day. And I have since grown pass listening to music with explicit language, but Dame(smile).  This was off the chain. The band, the sound system, the back up singers. It was better than being at a live concert. I loved it. And a Big shout out to Mannie Fresh as well. They All did that Thang.
Mannnn somebody give not only juvie but manie fresh his flowers. He killed the game effortlessly

I'm officially old. But 400 degrees is one of the best albums... ever. Don't waste your time trying to change my mind.

Everybody was back on the dance floor 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

Was hoping for that Vax that thang up ☠️
Hey, Juveeee! What about to name this band as "Juvenile's Fresh Band" and release it as a rap soul funky album? I'm sure it would be a BOMB!

This has been a staple in my daily musical soundtrack.   Juve and Mannie are an unbeatable team and the musicians are locked solid with each other.  The harmonizing of The Amours...chills, every time.  Been a Juvenile fan since back in the day, for very personal reasons.  I do believe with this performance, I have become a superfan!  This sessions just oozes with talent and happiness and my life is better having been able to experience this, even through a phone screen...
Wow...when you keep it real & just BE YOURSELF, God blesses you with preservation & the gift to inspire. He is a true artist...even without the hypemen & loud ambiance he is still SOOO GOOD. I am so impressed with the man he has matured into, and all of his amazing band members...and these beautiful women singers...wow...their voices are ANGELIC.
I cant love this enough ❤❤❤❤
❤😊🎉
This was and will be the best tiny des evaaaaaa!  They went awfff
Mannie Fresh doesn’t get enough credit for being the beat pioneer for southern rap

Although I love this combo just feels wrong it being on npr lol but at the same time most hype tiny desk concert.
Can't believe with all the previous greatness that this is actually the best one.
They need to put together a Mystical Tiny Desk.
The best tiny desk Yoo no cap

Been bumpin' Juvenile on the headphones this past month and cannot get enough!  This Tiny Desk perfomance is BRILLIANT.
may these women lead me to heaven, thank you god
The Amours are spectacular
Let Jewish burn Lauren Hill
If you don't love this then you don't love hip hop/rap
Man. They took OVER during 1999 and 2000! Miss those days!
Mannie Fresh the best HYPE PRODUCER
🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
The tiny desk we all needed. 🔥
It’s the Mannie Fresh of it all for me.  Real legend.
I enjoyed watching this.
This just took me back to senior year in high school. What a great production and Juvie and Manny were and still are legends!!!
Fantastic!
Wow! This was 🔥
This man went from not wanting to do a tiny desk, to having the best one yet 💯
Nothing but black classics!!!
You can tell how happy performing this makes Juvy.
Dem Louisiana boy’s different
This is absolutely phenomenal.   Loved this soooo much.  Just fun!!!
Best T D Desk performance yet and Manny Fresh joining the  crowd at the end for the encore EPIC !
Fresh has always been a vibe...he always smiling!
That shitz badass
Bruh why am I dancing? Cut it out, Tiny Desk
I just love that they let him be HIM. The authenticity of him plus the crowd participation is what made this an unforgettable performance and we were able to give Juvenile and Mannie Fresh their flowers
The best so far
LOOOOOOVED THIS!!!!

Man, Juve still one of the best to ever do it. That was fun.
Go head that's my boi juve
Manny really enjoyed this
How can I help grade the papers MUSIC for ALLMIGHTYS PEOPLE WHATS MY GRADE TEACHER
I can’t stop watching this . This was truly beautiful and so nostalgic! Everything feels okay ❤️❤️❤️
WOW so many awesome Tiny Desk classics Wu Tang, T-Pain, Mac Miller, Anderson Paak how do you pick a favorite!? True entertainers, true artist this is easily my favorite TDC! Thank you for the memories! CASH Money Records really did take over for the 99' and 2000's! NO CAP!
i started having nostalgia “you seen that 98 Mercedes on Tv, i bought that” love his cadence
where exacltly are the concerts held?
Mr Fresh is cooler than a Fan! Mr Juvenile is basically the same. Glad they can still do this without the hassle of ...... don't know what it took to get there, so...Than😢for the entertainment brothers. 👍🏽🤟🏽✊🏽
Never heard the explicit lyrics - hope the kids aren’t listening
Just go ahead and give all the money to the organizer of this
WE NEED THE YING YANG TWINS ON TINY DESK!!!!
Juvenile did to that little desk what Chris Farley did on that SNL episode.
Manny fresh reminds me of my lunch lady
Props to many fresh im sure he was the one arranging everything
It’s interesting how the violin players needed sheet music but the saxophone players didn’t. Two being classically trained and the rest playing by ear. Very interesting
Shoutout to the lady at the end who brought her vinyl with her to secure that autograph lol i have both those records and would've done the same
Love Juvenile, you did great OG❤🎉❤🎉
Greatest video I’ve seen in a long time period. Nostalgia overflowing such an awesome vibe
Bruh, from HotBoys to Juve The Great. Listening to the 90s come full loop is nostalgic at minimum and so fitting for this 80s-90s Nola native. The vibes fit so perfectly being 40 now!
Energy is everything greatest NPR performance ever
Amazing
This is drinking dom p out of a styrofoam cup
This is probably the best one I have seen!
The smile on my face right now maaaaannn.  this was great!
One of the most underrated rappers to do it. Definitely top 5 in my opinion.
This is definitely a 💎
This goes hard Af 🔥
It's 4:36 a.m. and I have this hooked up to my surround sound system.  My kids are cranky 😠 they had like another hour or two before they have to get ready for school. I'm getting ready for work. My youngest just walked in talking about Mom you listen to rap. I'm like Mama has a past lol. When that Nola Clapp came on I almost twerked. Took me back to my high school days. I love it💚
Hey ummmm if you guys wanna like idk have Mr. Mannie Fresh headline i think we as consumers of your content would really like it. If it somehow happens thank you. if not thank you still!!!!
Me likes this too much✌️❤️🤘
Shout out to juvenile and Mannie fresh. Legends in the game
I have been watching Tiny Desk concerts for years, and this one is in my top ten performances.
3:11
Tiny desk is great.   It was good to see Juvenile and Mannie have such a good time performing
Insert “From the 99s and the 2000s” here 20:19
Top 5 Tiny Desk and not 5.
The crowd was supposed to say “That’s my DJ!” 5:59
I love this here 😂
I have a feeling that Juvie doesnt take drugs like many rappers. Dude's brain is on fire remembering all those lyrics. Back that thang up couldve been potentially be a gangsta song but I like it how made it into a party music!!
NPR has done it again! 'Nuff Said! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Magical 😊
Slow motion on repeat
I would've gladly given all my geeters to be there. 😂 That hot boyz era was unmatched 🔥🔥🔥

I’ve watched this many times
Best concert ever tiny desk is a genius
My son in his 20’s showed me this & I can’t stop watching. Love, love. Nostalgia. ♥️
🎉Phenomenal 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Something about the resonance of “set it off” almost blew the back window out of a 2001 Yukon Denali.  I mean 4 15” custom box. Two 1100d and a battery helped. But this song absolutely dropped. I’m still deaf manny and I thank you.
This needs sent to the library of congress immediately for preservation.
God Tier Tiny Desk ❤️‍🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Going into this, I didn't think this would be the best Tiny Desk. It's a vibe and I feel like I am right there.
Maaan. I wanna hang out with Manny so bad.
One of the best, if not the best tiny desk among tiny desk concerts lol
THIS IS RAPP!!!!!!
His smile is so contagious ❤

Wow this was great … I got to enjoy all my faves used to in high school
Forever love Juvenile Had every album in middle school! 400 Degrees was the best! So glad your getting your glowers!! You 's a paper chaser you got ya block on fiya remaining a G until the moment you expire. RIP my sister loved this song!

400 Degreez is one of the best, most underrated rap albums of all time. “Ha” was years ahead of its time.
He just had the voice for rap. His tone is incredible. My favorite rap voice ever.
Ayeee Slow Motion for Me ❤
I’m gonna tell my little cousins these were Lin Manuel Miranda’s mentors…
I keep coming back to this tiny desk concert it has by far got to be the best one thus far love Juvenile and Manny Fresh
I'm a Asian man from Japan, I used to listen to these guys songs in 2000s early. Thast really gets me emotional. Thank you. And Mannie fresh wearing nice T- shirts.

Juve needs a concert!
Ha changed the game 🔥   Hov was a genius for the remix 😂
I can’t express how fire this performance was. My head was bobbing non stop.
Trick daddy next
This morning must be the best t
😂😂😂❤
Rap with a backing jazz band has such an incredible sound. Everyone looks like they're having a ton of fun. Mannie's smile gets me every time.
Juve is still awesome!
20:06. The continent of Africa is yours too. I imagine I bring these instruments to Africa and have students practice this instrument 20:06 and perform to the actual artist virtual or in person to win for a price of 1 or 2 year fully pay school fee. I wish I have the money to build a music school in Africa and make this happens it would be fire.
The band is awesome az well. Juvenile is the Tuu him and fresh started it oll.  They put new Orleans on the map.
Mannie is one of the best producers of all time
I've been watching tiny desk for years now. I've enjoyed every performance. But this..... This one makes my soul happy, made my smile dance, and lifted my spirits. The band, performers, and crowd all equally enjoyed this classic episode.  Kudos. Cheers to 50 years of hip hop, and a toast to 50 more!
So Nipsey cousin on keys...
I love Juvie but give props to Mannie Fresh too! He’s the GOAT 🐐
Y'ALL losing y'all's mind over Beyonce Let me know ehen Juvie in Town.  Im there, in my soulja rag & dickies fit
The two ladies singing background are unreal and steal the show for me.
Wow-this was great!! Especially the horn's & other instruments added to songs!
Trombone Shorty!!!!!
ALL. SONGS. CONSIDERED. 👏👏👏
Off top 🔥🔥🔥
VAX THAT THANG UP!!
Does anyone know what kind of head rag he wearing? Or how to tie it!! Looks dope!

Lil Wayne I got to do a tiny desk now
This is probably my favorite so far... they looked like they had fun doing this concert
Wow it really is a tiny desk Library room looks cool we need more rap artists doing this ., this is only the most gangster artist you have on your channel 💀

The New Orleans energy left cash money with Mannie Fresh
First one is my favorite track from Juvy. Best tiny desk!
Juvenile the goat 🐐
They would of wanted to see me in HR after the encore.

🚒🚒🔥🔥🔥🔥
One of my favorite artists from the south ever. Juvi such a beast. Much love from TX
This is amazing! Everyone loved Juvenile back in the day. It was hard to dislike his music no matter what scene you were from. So dope to see him crushing it in such an amazing way at a tiny desk concert all these years later!🎶
WOW
Shout out to the audience too
I got a little emotional watching this  and going through all those memories from back when these albums dropped.. Im from Philly me and my folks had all of thier albums!
This was a great show! Juvenile the great and Mannie is awesome at what he did as well. This made me appreciate these guys even more.
The BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This guy says the n-word a lot.
I’m feelin the soulful jazz vibe 🫡
This set was fire🔥. Thank you Juvenile and Mannie Fresh! This takes me back to high school and college years. 😘
They pushed the poison shots 😢 , no thank you , theses former heroes are dead to me
Y’all did this
The live music with the orchestra section with the raspy vocals and crowd transcended the genre of hip-hop. If you are a hip-hop or rap fan doesn't even matter. This is truly appreciated
Yesss
Juve looking like the Grandmother we all need right now 😊 love this!
Juvenile why... You're unhinged you and Manny went wild
Bruh they called juvie back..i love it
Ghetto legend! This was for the culture
He still rocking golds love juvenile

Tiny Desk is the greatest platform to show the raw talent of artists from so many generations. Amazing.
Juvvvvii 🎤juvviii🕺🏿

Mannie Fresh looking more and more like Beetlejuice everyday.
Juvi in a vs battle would be lit

I remember being a little girl and how all our mamas use to come together they had da speaker, uncle was on da grill, they was drinking we was playing in da pool or water hose, and it was just this type of music being played they was dancing drinking and wasn’t being called bad mothers for having  a good time, I miss them days
Best one ever.....

25k comments but i still want to say mine. Juvie, Manny fresh, Wayne were all so instrumental in my younger years. Juvie they greatest!

I’m a 43 year old New Orleanian & this was my everything! Back in the day those songs were life. I had my first kid in 99 so I was 18 , pregnant & dancing in my living room to them on MTV !!  I was so proud of Juvenile when he blew up ! He sounds & looks exactly the same & Manny too! I wish Wayne could’ve been there but besides that this was perfect!! ⚜️⚜️⚜️
Is he lip-syncing? That just too clean! 🤔
THE INSTRUMENTS SOUNDS AWESOME SHOUT OU TO JUVE ❤❤❤❤ MANNIE FRESH THE CREATOR
What an absolute treat.
Great show
“She got it from her momma “ is missing
Who else is still coming to this performance to watch it on a regular basis??? Just perfection across the board!

Juve a real legend
I was told this was going to be great, and, it was even better.

It is so cool hearing this music orchestrated with live  instruments.  If you only knew the tech used to produce the recordings, you'd be surprised.  Manny, you are awesome.
Set it off still one of the all time fire tracks.

It's crazy when you hear this you forgot how much Lil' Wayne eventually overshadowed Juve, but Juve was the original front man and had HITS.
Music with a live band can't be beat
I been saying, in my opinion,  its Juve over Wayne
this was super dope, juve and manny killed it on the live instrumentals
I remember seeing them and DMX. Boa We had a TIME…🤸🏿😂

Perfect set except for its missing In My Life
The tempo on 400 degreez goes so hard
What is he drinking? Looks like him on the label of it
The project b!tch joint was on heavy replay back in the day
Pretty dope
When slow motion came on I almost lost my mind. Juvi and manni are a dream team. Ya'll deserve it all!
I wish my daddy was living he would have loved this ❤️❤️❤️
All hip hop should sound like this feel like real music 🎶
they really did bring me back to the 99-2thousandzz😩❤️❤️❤️
This is what Hip Hop looks like when we respect our Legends! We’re the first generation to experience Hip Hop Legends in their Maturity.
in a current world plagued by cancel culture and oversensitivity, it's so refreshing to re-live the true free speech/lyrics/expression era
Better than anything I've heard from the clowns rapping today
🔥🔥🔥🔥
My dawg smashed this performance 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Very nice. Love the vibes ❤
This...concert....brought goose bumps and tears to my eyes .. the culture is STRONG! AND!!! Juvie need to play with a live band more often.   This experiences online was next level...can you imagine being there live?!?!?
I still have my 400 degrees cassette tape!!! lol 😂  At 41 years old, this is nostalgic to me… 💪🏽  Legends, Juvi and Mannie.
Juvenile and Mannie, don’t have the words to honor these two! ❤🎉❤
Plus he kept it all Louisiana musicians 💯✊respect for that💯☝️
Top of the line performance, juvie and mannie fresh are outstanding
Plus funky fingers, Mr. Mannie Fresh👏👍✊☝️💯
Add Lil Wayne to this group and take it on a global tour. They’ll pack stadiums. More rap music should be performed like this instead of the backing track and fifteen goons with microphones.
Aye!!!!! 🙌🏽
The Greatest Love Song Ever Wrote 😅😅
I was a fan from the beginning had factory not boot leg🔥🔥🔥🔥
Juvie 🥃🕶💙🙏🏽🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶reminded everybody why they took over the 99-2000's....free BG

This hard!
This is wild, Jevi. No editing just raw some of those lyrics in "Project Chick" rough. Lol.  translates so well with band. NPR well done.
A thousand people downvoted this masterpiece. That's a thousand bad vibes we no longer need on this planet.
❤❤❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 The best tiny desk by far thank you!!! I felt like I was in concert
Still as fire as it was back in the day. I can see myself in my 60s still jamming Juvie grandchildren gone be like granny lit or whatever they'll call it then 😂

This was dope, dope as dope can be 😅
Real 👏👏
FOR THE MF SOUTHERN CULTURE 🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤
This is epic nostalgia remastered & flawlessly  💯
Greatest Tiny Desk in history
Man Cuban gooding jr was lit
This was one of the most fun tiny desk concerts that I’ve seen in a long time.  Juvie killed it and the audience was lit.  I loved the fact that he showcased other New Orleans talent as part of his performance.  Well done, proving he’s just as good as day one.  It was great to see him perform with Mannie Fresh also, the creator of those catchy New Orleans hip hop beats of the late 90’s into early 2000’s.
6:40 🔥 Can I just give a few more thumbs up come'on!!!
Juve da great
🔥🔥
Yoooooooo
Loves those khakis.
Yesss.…this was the best
Amazing
It's been a month and I still can't stop watching this
I truly didn't expect for this Tiny Desk to be so so gooood
Juvy been nice
I will watch this until it beats usher and then keep watching it
NPR tiny desk.  Classic!
Man we used to hop into my hooptie  and bump this whole album 20+years ago. 400 degreez is and will always be a classic
I think Juvy needs a residency in Vegas!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥Just relived my college days
That boy still hot!!!!!!!!
So 🔥
He did that needs to go on tour with manny
Omg I didn't know how much I needed that! Brilliant!
I will NEVER get over this! the culture is pleased 🥲
When entertainers had to actually have talent,really played their instruments, can and performed completely live. The good old days 💯
Juevy had a top ten album all tracks r fire a true mc
Remember when hip hop was fun??? Thank you Tiny Desk!
Mannie figgy fresh X Juve da great 🐐✨🔥🔥🔥🔥
CLASSIC!
It’s just amazing how this all came together man. The fans spoke and Juvenile delivered! S/O to him and the Legend Mannie Fresh with the assist‼️🔥
You know its lit when mannie do the shimmy ahimmy shake in the camera
"Juve brought two grammy winners to tiny desk......give me love" 😂😂😂
Dear NPR Tiny Desk, Please get Outcast to perform a Tiny Desk Concert! Please, thank you. Sincerely, Everyone
tha one album mannie put out...was so  under rated....if u kno u kno..
Man this was great <3
This what exactly what i needed to come across on YT. So many memories listening to his music through middle and highschool. 🔥
Sheesh, I forgot how 🔥 Juvie was. Ok, now bring Missy Elliot and Timb to Tiny Desk. I just know they will bring this same energy! 🔥🔥🔥
Mannie fresh a beast, so is Juvenile
I can't stop, y'all.
A mystical tiny desk would be nice
Goat desk concert
This the best tiny desk I keep coming back sombody tell juvie press this up for Apple tunes man!!!!
One of the bests td concerts ever. This crowd is amazing and Mannie is fantastic too.
Still using "the n-word". Africans and the rest of the world shaking their heads and wondering why..
Can We Get Him With Joyner?...
real cash money
Give Mannie Fresh is flowers!!!! One of the best to ever do it, and his catalog speaks for itself. The original GOAT of DJ’s.
I gotta admit I didn't really appreciate Juvenile in his prime, i was just on some different stuff, but this Tiny Desk is for real on another level with the energy and the things I was legit up to during that time. I missed out. Glad im getting it in now though, and I might just play this for my wife later tonight and break it off like the early days. Dirty like...
one of the best Tiny Desk's
That boy Juviiiiii!!!!

When I was a waitress at a small restaurant in South Mississippi, Mannie Fresh and his friends came in to eat one night and he left a phenomenal tip and was so kind. 10/10 person
WE WANT MOOOO!!!
HEYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Gotta Love Where Music Is At!
I want to see mystikal on this show
It's crazy how Manny looks way younger and rylo looks old ASF😂
Them boys got the prison outfit
Bling Blong
The lyrics...
I've seen them 3 times live in concert and after this Tiny Desk at the ripe age of 40, I will be seeing Juvey again in Tampa. Thanks for taking me from the hills of Tally, to New Orleans to Tampa. This will be my 4th time turning up and I will be ready for all the hood ish!
At about 9:20 the white boy was feeling that 😂
You got a lot of Girbuad jeans ha couple of yo potnas dope fiends huh?
I think this they  most viewed performance on tiny desk JUVENILE JUST HIT DIFFERENTL😂😂
Maaannnn…I’m back in my late teens/early twenties for 28 mins and some change listening to this. Juvy was one of my favorite artists back then. And I live in Houston so the cultural exchange from Houston to N.O. was absolutely amazing!!! We got all the hot music from there before everyone else. It’s like I felt the country was late getting on the bounce music train because I grew up with it. This is epic. The energy put me in the best mood this month. I’m going through it so I definitely needed to be reminded of better times.
504!!!
BRING BACK MANNY FRESH AND JUVE AND WAYNE ALL BACK TOGETHER !!! WE NEED THIS !! ILL TAKE ANOTHER HOTBOY AND BIGTYMERS ALBUM BUT BIRD MAN DONT HAVE TO BE IN IT LOL
26:21 is where it really went to 11. Manny the mvp 😂
Mannie fresh is a very underrated producer
He is a really good storyteller. He does a great job at making you think he is talking with you. Articulate and can enunciate really well.
I would like Lil Wayne to do a tiny desk with BG as soon as he gets out of jail
That was timeless thanks tiny desk 🎉🎉🎉
Possibly the best Tiny Desk I have seen ! You could feel the love❤
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
On this night I discovered Tiny Desk Concerts. On this Night Juvenile and Mannie Fresh Live as the Great Street Symphony
So fire
When you hear those strings playing, you already know.
Lawd.  This took me back to my late teens and early twenties
Omg this was so 🔥 🔥

Simply Legendary Show 😊 .  Hashtag (“Instant Classic”) .
This was 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I feel like I'm at a hoodrat symphony, and I love it here! 😂😂😂
More please❤
Yes I ❤
That was excellent.  The algorithm strikes again!  I haven't been to live rap show in over 15 years --are they performing with live bands/DJs more often now?   Or is it still a lot of talking over album tracks?
Not me listening to this at work…….😅😂
This 🥶
Manny fresh is a genius make All the music where live instruments can be used
Best concert of the series by far
Mac's dont trip hat on the shelf 😥
amazing
This was so entertaining, Juvenile and Mannie Fresh compliment each other so well, they work together so well, what a treat for the audience there and for me, Juvenile just might be underrated, that man has bar's for day's 😀, I enjoyed watching this 😎👏👏👏👍
This dude is a whole vibe....nice
This was AMAZING !!!!!
The students knew the assigment....well done juv
Juuuuuuvvvyyyyyyyyy!!!!!💯💯💯💯
Every time I hear it, I feel more confident to be unapologetically New Orleanian
Man I was a KID on my way to school every morning my mom was bumping ANY Juvenile that came on the radio I wanna say sometime between when I was in kindergarten-2/3rd grade I can vividly remember hearing his music and remembering these lyrics as a KID. Slow motion and rodeo will forever be 2 songs that makes me feel warm and fuzzy on the inside as if I’m listening to it for the first time even if I have em on repeat. I can wholeheartedly say idk where I’d be if none of this music influenced me in some way shape or form. LEGENDARY
Still got it juve like im bk in da 90s
close to 5 million views in one month means do an album 😂
D O P E !!!
So worth the watch
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Stop playing like Juviee ain’t kick that door open for cash money and change the game!
In 10 years I bet nun of these people making these tick tok songs will be able to do anything like this
This has gotta be in my top 5 tiny desks now, what a great episode
10
A beautiful collaboration by all involved.  Wonderful to see that true musicianship is not dead and is still very much appreciated.  👍👍🔥🔥🔥
Juvenile and Mannie Fresh put one down for the records!!!! In my Rick James voice, this tiny desk is "Cold Blooded"!!! Thank you guys for this one!
20:02 here ya go
When them strings came out 🔥🔥🔥
Juve had that tiny desk rocking like the old days 👏 👏 👏.
Lil Wayne tiny desk? 😅
If he would’ve just said from the 99 to the 2000s he would’ve blown the whole crowd away
That 400 degrees give you chills Everytime. That biych wicked 💪🏽💯
Best tiny desk concert ever.. salute to manny
Uuuhhhhhhhhhhh
I see any brother in Camo & dickies..I automatically assume he is from the NOLA
Watch Juvenile 400 Degreez album start selling again😂
Manny deserves way more credit than he's given! As for Juvenile, the man has not lost an ounce of his flow!
Amazing 🫡🤑🍾
I think this is the best tiny desk performance I’ve ever seen
This should have more lines
Watching again & again! NEW ORLEANS Represent! 💜 ⚜️💜
Juvenile make me wanna twerk😅😅😅
Historic.
Wow
That man is a treasure! This is what rap is not that trash they have out now
"Ha" 🎺🥁🎷 You a paper chaser got ya block on fire remaining a G!  💃🏿💃🏿💃🏿
One of the best tinies I've heard
I'm still coming back watching this, it's too great
Boy I almost cried hearing Rodeo 🥲
This might be the best tiny desk performance. Bought all worlds together from wodies , to the homies to the project chicks and suburbs 😂
❤
Best one
Gonna be hard to top this tiny desk concert!!!
My funeral procession soundtrack. Not in Nola but on Queen Jean, Topsail, NC OR Kundwala, Firozpour Dist, Punjab
Slow mooottttion!!!! Jumped up as soon as the intro started
4.7 Million views!!! Check the other counts. No one else is coming close to these numbers.
Juvie said we bout to get real athletic up in here !👟🍑🥁😂
This was refreshing😂😂😂 I ain't know I needed it but I did. 😂😂😂
We need birdman now 😅
Best tiny desk eva
This was friggin fantastic!  Love seeing Juvey doing stuff in 2023!
Turk mad at Juve but he got money now so its all good.😂
This was way, way overdue!! Juvie and Manny alone is a whole vibe!! The horns sealed it with the Nawlins sound!
How i am classy  twerking around my house to this 😅😅😅
Juvé should change his name to “Senior Citizen” & change his style to gospel speech
Rodeo need tonbe re recorded and released this way... live band back ground singers and all
Mannie looks like everybody's favorite Aunt. He was definitely underappreciated
When you never thought you’d finish a 30 minutes video that randomly popped up. I’m 27 and this is the music I miss
1:23
🔥🔥🔥‼️
Can this win a Grammy?  If not, it should.  Wow!
Yassssssssssssss

This history live
Is there a reason why more rappers don't take a full orchestra on tour? This video proves that it just works
This when the music was actually good. Now a bunch of non talented mumble rappers
This whole concert was 🔥
NOLA music 🎶 legends
Bro... I thought this dude died like 9 years ago!
Great show juve and mannie 👍🏾💯💪🏾
Smilin and vibin
SHE COOOOOKED THAT DEEEEKKKKKK!!!😂😂😂😂
HE NEEDVTO GO ON TOUR!!
This is one of the best live performances I’ve ever heard
Juve is the shiznit!!
Dang.....
I love seeing this generation shine.
Bruuuuuuuuuuuh!!!!!
The violin player will get to tell people the rest of her life that she did this and it may be the greatest thing ever
He sounds exactly like his songs..I love Juv's New Orleans accent..reminds me of my uncle's from uptown New Orleans ❤ I actually love seeing them enjoy themselves..our ppl work so hard and often don't enjoy the fruits of their labor. I am hoping the generations that are now in their 40's and 50's can enjoy life too and know that hard work and play go hand and hand ❤
This was amazing!!!
Real OG’s of rap !!!! They did a dam go job and the music and band did a good job
Outstanding performance! The essence of New Orleans.
If I ain’t a hot boy then what do you call that? Classic 400 degreez   🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Classic!
The smile on Mannys face 🥹
🔥
Wow amazing!!!
Just realized they blinged out the Tiny Desk Concert…awesome
This made me smile
I’m not gonna lie this was straight fire. It literally sounds better than the actual recordings.
Very interesting 🎉
Juvenile sounds so good live.
In 2023, an invite to play Tiny Desk means more to the musicians and fans than an induction and appearance at the Rock 'n' Roll HOF. Nobody's having more fun. Mannie Fresh over here living his best life.
Yo when Bling Bling came on, I was 16 again cruising in my Buick with friends hot boxing 🔥 🚬  thank you for doing this 🙏
the song ha got me.
hes so versatile and i love it, his voice sounds the same on the real tracks with and without autotune, hes so real & i love him so much.
I'm a punk rocker but this is really impressive. They are actually playing the instruments and Juvenile and Manny are rapping like it was 20 years ago.
16:05 project bxitch
I wish I could listen to this masterpiece for the first time again.
I wish I could listen to this masterpiece for the first time again.

I’ve watched this like 10 times! Mostly when I’m in bed….
So nice of NPR putting this unknown artist on the map. This juvenile guy is going places.   Kidding all 90s babies jammed Juvi on the way to school.
Manny Fressshhh! Yes! The joy this brought me y’all. I was cheezin the entire time turnin up on my couch! Shout out to the band! They held it together and did so well! I’d been swangin’ forgetting I’m suppose to be playing an instrument 😂
What is he drinking?
Im 90s guy and i dont have an idea how much i need this man back in my life...
I have saw this tiny desk concert 4 times...😊😊😊😊😊
Goat. I’m lil brother I grew up on this

Dude on the tenor sax is my favorite. He gets it.
20:50🔥🔥🔥🔥
Love his passion
Fun!!!!!!!
No.1
Juvenile is real one.
Man when all this music came out I was walking from the Calliope to the Magnolia to attend Carter G Woodson Middle School in New Orleans. Brings back so many memories
This is the best thing that happened this summer
Oh Rodeo sounds so smooth
Manny look like evrry other jamaican aunty
This tiny desk was my first time actually waiting for a Youtube premiere. Ive watched it at least 5 times since. Still as good as the first time. Band is COOKIN.
This was so dope 🙌🏾 👏🏾
Good ghetto fun lyrics I wanna see him in a versus 😁
They cloned Tyrone church scene? Same band?
I've watched this IDK, 10 times? Thank you!
Mannie Fresh, cute as you can be. Love.
That band 🔥 Juvenile and Mannie legends! Brings back memories of listening to Cash Money!
Thank me later 16:15
When I was younger, I thought I was apart of cash money. Walking around with the foil on my teeth. Good ol Days. Eunice Louisiana stand up
Manny created the beats of my youth lol.. beast ⚡️🇺🇸
Wow this was a Free show for me 🔥 I never heard Juevy sound like this before and Rodeo them Women Blew!
Absolutely loved loved loved it!!!! Turnt up all by myself 🔥🔥🔥
The way Juvenile & the Amours went in on RODEO had me in tears!!!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Black boy joy😂😂
Rodeo ❤❤
That slow motion and Rodeo set 🔥
LOVE this
Dope way to end the day
Juvenile a sell out, lost all respect for him when he did the Vax Song.  Should've abandoned him long ago when he didn't go to his daughters funeral
You can see how surprised the was with the love for his music this was so dope I'm glad for him .
This is absolutely incredible.
I watch this everyday. I listen to it when I'm driving. I listen to the entire set but that Rodeo arrangement has me walking around saying , " work that, twerk that, serve that, come on and do the rodeo, let me see you bounce that, move that, do that "
This was Fire!!!!!
This real rap. Glad i grew up in the 90's. Those where the good ol days
Thanks Tiny desk producers this was super awesome 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
It was the best of times and we didn't even know it. This brings back alot of fun memories.  Thanks!!
Juvenile 🔥
Crazy how he remembers all of his older work like it’s nothing no hiccups or anything
Literally, he performs better than Wayne does.
Yes sir!
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Well done!!!! They killed that joint! Encore! The musicians take a bow!
Music ❤

This one of the funniest Tiny Desk concerts lol. I loved every bit of it.

I don't know if it is proper or polite to request other artists on someone else's Tiny Desk.....but Please please please Jodeci needs a tiny desk.  Thanks   Mgmt.
Best Tiny Desk so far. 🔥
This is better than most stadium performance.   I had more fun watching them having genuine fun than i should have.  I'm not sure who put the music part together,  but he deserve to be known.

LOVE THIS PERFORMANCE! I've seen quite a few amazing Tiny Desk performances through out the years but this one is by far my favorite! The way Juevenile delivered his hits combined with the brass, strings and the energy from the crowd was phenomenal. Manny Fresh was also great in this performance. Thank you NPR.

Just had to do another post. Juve....all them years down, 🥷come back with ❤️‍🔥.
What shirt is many fresh wearing
Classic I would paid anything to have seen this so up close in person. Priceless!!!
Really wish he woulda played LL Cool
I am very disappointed in my teenage self. I think I was happy and invented the limp with heavy bits, but no. It was just juvenile
Experience an electrifying New Orleans vibe at Tiny Desk with Juvenile and Mannie Fresh leading the way! The musicians give it a soulful performances, creating an unforgettable musical journey. 🎵🎷🎺
Also, I want to say the juvenile and Mannie Fresh are virtually ageless. They look fantastic! And if you look at all the drama that juveniles been through throughout his life, I’m glad he’s still alive to this day.
I remember the original releases. We were in different cars, driving around, being cool and also not cool. But I don't think a single person could remember the lyrics like juvenile
NPR…., YOU GUYS DID THIS ONE!! I have been a fan. However I love all the innocence of Juvenile, Not knowing about the tiny desk. The New Orleans sound set the room off!! Great job!
He really said "what's a tiny desk?" And then gave us this!!!!!??? 😭🙏🏽🌈
Why am I crying 😭🙏🏽💐💐💐 that was amazing thank you Juvie & MF & Band and TDC!!!!
That cellist’s parents must be so proud.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
That was a magnificent performance by all my #1 Artists with their band.....😮WOW!!!!!!!!
I feel like he and Danny Brown could do a killer collab.
Everybody’s facial expressions, goofy smiles and laughter when he drops the vulger bars. 🤣 I’m cranking up.
Knew as soon as the strings came out ya'll
This is my third time watching this. Cash Money for the 99 and 2000!!!!
What is this rachet goodness?!! Lol.
BRUHHHH WHO EVER THE PERSON IS AT TINY DESK WHO SAID HEYYY WE NEED JU FOR  A TINY DESK NEEDS A DAMM RAISE LOL THIS WAS AMAZING WOW
i watch this almost everyday-lets get these views up
I can't like this enough!
Somebody find the guitarist with the beard! 😩❤️
Watched too many times!! We told you Juvie!! Lol
🔥👑🔥 Legendary. On replay...
🎉 Juve snapped and Mannie fresh what a performance ! Best thing I’ve seen on the internet lately
Classic
A true masterclass and what a catalogue …. And so good to see Manny Fresh rocking right by his side. General Juve - ‘Salute!’
From experience tiny desk concerts are fun. 😎
When Mannie Fresh do that lil shimmy at the end…I lost it!
Bomb!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
We need a Mary J Blige or Keyshia Cole Tiny Desk ASAP ❤️
All i cared about was that he did the 400 intro. He did it and then brought more than I and im pretty sure anyone else expected. Manni and Juvie are a southern Louisiana and American treasures.
My boy look like he having a ball.. GREAT JOB JUV!!!
Girl you looks good wontcha…
This took me back lololol nostalgic greatness
I have to be honest, I clicked this as a "Ha ha I 'member Juvenile I was just doing my "Ha" impression the other day!" thinking I'd listen to one song and move on but I didn't know the first song would be this good. I LOVE hearing these songs played live this way. Mannie Fresh holding it down, too. This "HA" is off the ⛓️ I'll be here for the whole thing for sure, thanks for sharing! 👊 4:37 🔥 (edit: halfway through this AMAZING version of BTAU and 😳 🔥🔥🔥 told you I'd be here for it all 😂)
This is so so so good! I love every aspect from Manny Fresh performing too and the musicians were impeccable❤
This was great
FiiiiiiiiyyyyyyeeRRRRRRRR BOYS! WHOOOOO!
4.5 millions views. I’ll leave it there!
This so good I’ve watched it 10x still 🔥
Please give Manny fresh his flowers 🌺🌹❤
This is my 9th or 10th time watching this & it’s my favorite! Takes me to a simpler and fun time in my life! This was one for the culture! Juve & Mannie are the 🐐s!
Maaan!! This was the best tiny desk concert eva, it was lit-litty!!! Juvenile and manny did they thang
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Manz dem even got Nipsey's twin on the keyz
Hip-Hop
Sounds Amazing!!
I love you Juve!!!
Will Smith/Bryan Mbuemo on the keys
Trombone Shorty and Jon Batiste are having a blast! Smiles all around!
Their vibe is unmatched!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Too bad The Hot Boys weren't there...
I've watched this numerous times now. This my fav tiny desk episode.
This fresh ,great energy 🔥
Still watching this❤
Just missin weezy
At the :48 second part of the set (and many others) you can tell Mannie Fresh was locked in to the production of the band when he twirled his finger. He knew the entire set inside and outside.
True talent! Juvenile always went in live 🔥🔥🔥 could only imagine one with B.G.
We need Turk, Lil Wayne, BG and Juvenile together in a Tiny Desk concert! Pls HipHop God make it happen!
Slid
Now they need project pat
Pretty sure this just changed my life, as well as everyone involved.....THANK YOU Tiny Desk for being open to new things and realizing the power of music...... 🤯🤯🤯......Absolutely Fantastic.....this is exactly how i needed to start my day!!
The whole set was 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ik when he put dat rag on his head he was gone clown.....band on point.....love when manny do his lil 2 step.....one of the best tiny desk
This is the best thing I've seen in a while fr  😂
The real heroes of Cash Money Records. Juve was the biggest artist on the record label and next to that man is one of the greatest producers in Hip Hop history.
It was all great, but Slow Motion at 8:08 was my favorite
These guys need to live forever! Take us back to the good ol'days... legends only getting better with time
I love they are loyal to their product.
400 Degreez is one of my favorite songs of all time 🔥
Thank you Tiny Desk Big Thank you to Juvie and Mannie 👏🏾🫶🏾💪🏾♥️♥️♥️♥️
This took me back❤❤❤❤
When he opened the show with 400 degreez I hopped out of bed, fired a blunt up and started looking for my red bandana
This is the best Tiny desk I have seen; the crowd was lit! Engaged! I love it!
Black Twitter Has Brought This Tiny Desk Episode to a YT Near You ! 😂💯
Maaaan! This the best tiny desk ever! I have watched it like 50 times. Juvie the Great! I've always said Manny Fresh was a genius? This was so dope!
Still jam this til dis day love my city
Already knew what time it was when the strings came out lol
Juvi the MFing great
Awesome, desk and ✏️
Whew back on this thang again 🎉🎉🎉 CLASSIC
I’m OBSESSED 😅😅 best Tiny EVER!!!!
It's the look on the faces of the band members while doing the hook of Project Chick for me 😂. They are looking like, "ok, we are really doing this at the Tiny Desk". Lmbo  😂
The reason I re fell in love with this music is they are clearly having a good time, I like seeing that
So many songs I didn't realize are NOT on my rap playlist.  I remember Ha coming out on the Video Jukebox back in late 90's-2000 . I knew NOTHINg about New Orleans slang or anythng but that song got me. It was so weird, so different than us. We went from clowning them for their gold teeth and accent to buying albums.  we loved it
Only god knows what the future might bring 🔥🔥 i remember saving money for the tape 400 degreez. It pop then i taped it back together missing a whole verse 😂
I've lost count on how many times I've watched this.
20:03 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Yea
This was so beautiful & fun ! 😂❤🔥as I was laying in bed watching this , i REALLY couldn’t stop myself from dancing . I was like “yuuuuuppppp THEY STILL GOT IT 😍” 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
We need a new Juve album PRONTO
Best one yet. End of.
Timeless classics 🔥 🫡 ❤
Everything about this is YES YES YAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSSSS❤😊
Why he made me get out the bed for the orchestra???  He said glutes and I knew where we were going!
I swear my name was in every rap song.  Project Chick was it!  This Tiny Desk Concert made me so happy.
Best hip hop show..😊
Bring back memories I missed the mid 90's juvi BG Turk lil Wayne super producer Manny fresh
Hands down the best tiny desk concert to this day
Phenomenal 🔥🔥☮️☮️💖
When they hire Nolia thugs to run the church choir.
Juve and Manny Fresh are legends! This was what the internet was made for.
On repeat! Loved it!!!!!  Tiny Desk, keep the elegantly ratchet party going with Ying Yang Twins!!!!
BEST TINY DESK EVER 4 REAL 👍🏿
The best I've seen
I mean it’s only my 20th time watching it 🔥🫡
Juvenile Essentials just got downloaded to my Apple Music.  Thank you!
Manny Fresh being a part of this was a pleasant surprise ❤
That slow motion cut was a masterpiece. The fusion from those saxs and bass. Whole thing was rich. Best tiny desk version so far.
Younger generation "Wow Mannie Fresh is going to make this Juvenile guy famous" 😂💀
This was so hard 🖤🖤
Classic
Je chercher cette magnifique chanson depuis 26 j’ai maintenant 42 je l’avais en k7 maintenant je l’écoute h24 sur 🍏music forever gratitude 🙏

Best tiny desk ever
I’ve watched this from beginning to end atleast 7 times 😂 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Everyones reaction at 20:23 😏
I like the energy
This was awesome .. when Ha started playing I almost started fighting my 4 year old son ..
By far the best performance
I watched an interview with lil Wayne he said he some of juvie style cuz he could talk and make it into a song ❤❤
❤❤❤
This is awesome.Shot out to that dude in the audience too singing and swaying to the chorus of slow motion.Epic
Mannie Frizzle!!! Dude is an absolute legend. So many careers would’ve gone nowhere without his musical talents.
Fck juve can flow lyrical nolia beast, Them Hot Boyz & Mannie were Special 4 real
Nice!
Still 🔥 the real 🐐
Juvenile with Grammy awards winner trombone shorty and Baptiste and live band - perfection!!🎉🎉

OMG THE BEST❤❤❤❤
Tiny Desk is now Big!
AMAZING!!! JUVI & MANNY NEED TO DO.A LIVE PERFORMANCE
400 Degreez is a classic that is absolutely slept on.
What's he drinking?
Manny Fresh is arguably one of the best producers of the last 20 years, the man is extremely talented.
The Best 26 mins of my decade 🙌🏾🙌🏾❤
That was fun!!
best tiny desk ever! up there with edward sharpe and anderson paak
30 min!!!!
Juvy with the gold fronts still. All heaters.
This took me way back...
And here I thought the Usher one couldn’t be topped. This one not only topped it, it obliterated every other Tiny Desk concert before it. I needed this more than I thought I knew 😢🙂
Was the first beat from golden eye n64 👀 memories 😩
I COULDNT STOP SMILING
I love the encore!!!
This one is my favorite!!! Unexpected and soooo needed! My coming of age years are unmatched.  Juve is still lit, Mannie is precious, and the bass player looks delicious!!! What his name is? Ayyyyeeeee!
I’ve watched this 3 times in a row
That was a vibe! Juve the great!!
Finally watched in its entirety. This was nostalgic  and just memorable.
Omggggggg this was the most amazing thing to to watch… WOW❤❤❤
Hands down Juvenile 400 degrees was one of the best albums and still hitting in hard in 2023
My neighbor plays this when we tee off on the course, sets the tone 🔥🔥🔥 400 Degreez. Talking to the course like “You don’t want to f with me!”
This is such an amazing Tiny Desk. Juvie is so talented and deserving of this moment. Manny Fresh added that extra touch.. This was so good 🎉🎉❤❤❤
Shoutout to New Orleans! ✨⚜
Wow! Pure Magic 🔥 I'm still weak from hearing them play "Project B*tch" on the trombone!! 🤣
VERY creative. This is beautiful
dope af
Guys a total POS beats women and then NPR gives him a platform. Whose worse ?
Hip Hop is the sound of love
“Give me a project b!txh”
Magical!
This makes me want more ratchet ness on tiny desk. Go get Too Short, Lil Wayne, e40, The Game, etc
One of the best to do it from my home state! ⚜️
Listen!!! I didn’t know I needed this til I heard it. Took me back to my Senior year and why there are so many 99’ -2000 kids born!!!!
This is awesome 🎉 first time I saw it I literally cried brought back some good memories ❤
Best tiny desk performance thus far.
Killed it
One like is not enough... EPIC beyond EPIC
Amazing! Wow!
Sooooooooooo good!❤
Title should be: Juvenile feat Mannie Fresh: Tiny desk concert
My Kid: Dad can you sing me a song from your childhood? Me: Give me a project chick, give me a hoodrat chick, one that don't give af, and say she took that d....
Phenomenal… 🔥
Mannie turns the mic around & just a bunch of goofys n lames.. I guarantee not a single person In that crowd knew what they were witnessing.
Slow Motion For Me!
That was so Gooddddd🎉
Wow while watching this I didn't realize how many songs people have sampled from him
Classical music now. Teach this in the universities
Come through Juvieeeee.. Manny Fresh.. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🫶🏽😮‍💨
Juve really made cash money respect to Wayne but he really got it popping if you old enough to remember
The best!
I felt like I wasn't supposed to see what's behind the camera XD
I keep cutting to 24:00. Classic
Aye!😎🔥 My favorite tiny desk so far.
I ran into Juvie this weekend at the airport, I ask to take a picture with him. I started rambling saying, “I watched your Tiny Desk live!!” Lol
“How many times have you seen this?” “That is correct”
Legendary!!!!! GOOD JOB NPR MUSIC!!!!!
Becky got fired after this
Went crazy 🦅🗣️🔥
amazing! The way I woulda cut up fa my city in that room 😭😭
My god this was cinematic straight fire. I’ve watched a lot of tiny desk but this takes the mf cake
This brought back memories ❤
I like it sounds good
I didn't know how much I needed this.
Amazing ❤👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
THANK YOU FOR THIS!!!!
16:15-16:27 it’s what we’re all here for
6:39 Drag Em N Tha River... Ah Yes. Beautiful Hip Hop.
I swear this is probably the best one I’ve seen yet!
good to see a few people i looked up to from my childhood still doin good.. not many of them left anymore :/
This is dope nice to see them still have it !!!
Tiny desk does an amazing job of allowing artists from ALL walks of life to express their art, their story, their voices. Never lose this NPR! This was a blast to watch, and who ever coordinated this in your office needs a raise ASAP. Epic.
20:00 what they all still come to him for.  The biggest hit of 1999-2000.
This was so nice to watch
One of my favorite tiny desks right here.  The energy, the crowd, the band, the hits.  Unreal.

This is so unbelievably sick.

Started off with my FAVORITE Juve song!!!🤘
Back That one of the greatest songs ever
This is my favorite so far!!! Juve The Great!
It all comes back to jazz and blues .....there's nothing like live instruments...but then again ain't nothing like a synth and sound board
This made me so happy 😆 we wondered how we be listening to the music when we got older this is the answer some jazz instrumentals we gonna be lit in our 70s 😂
“Chase it with the Hennessy now that’s how a G Play” 🥃
Well done, I want to go to juvie concert now 💃🏾
Look at my uncle’s 🥰‼️💯
Could use more cow bell.
Honestly duck tiny desk concerts. Sold out venues are it
This the best tiny desk so far
ive never clicked something so fast. I used to bump HA all the time. such a sick song. Juve still got it to. What a voice and flow.   You a paper chaser, gotcha block on fire, remaining a g until the moment you expire,  you know what it is, to make nothing out of something, you handle your biz and dont be cryin and sufferin.
Just Real OG here 💥🏴‍☠️🤚🏼
Awesome

We needed this one for the culture‼️✊🏿
Why mannie fresh looking like someone’s mama?
After watching for the 15th time 😂….  So Juvie no longer says “Hoe Who is Playing with”. All ghetto polite!!! 😂😂😂
Rewatch gang...3 times and counting. My goodness! 🔥 💃🏾
I’ve watched this like 5 times already. I just love how much fun it looks like Juve and Mannie and everyone else is having. Maybe the best Tiny Desk ever.
Mannie fresh looking like somebody Auntie 🤣
Juve always had such an original flow. feels like he's losing the beat but then lands right back on it w/ perfect timing!
Wow no way did I think they could pull that off the way it went off. Bringing me back to high school!!
❤
the past 4 years that I have been watching tiny desk this is the BEST set so far
Legend
This Tiny Desk team are getting better and better. Brilliant. And a very wide range of artists. Keep them coming.🙏🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
it's all love!!!!!
Next up on NPR, is country music too misogynistic and too profane?  😂
Amazing performance !! Juvenile killed it .... I also couldn't help but notice Mannie Fresh w/ the L&F AJ1s ! ✊❤
They grown man it

Loved every second of this ❤❤ flowers 💐 well deserved
If there was a reward for how many times I've watched... 😁
Really REALLY good performance.  Always thought he was OK. But his voice now is on point
Oh, my middle school anthems! Wish we could have had a Big Tymers add-on for my fave song  "still fly." hahaha
Just left the NOLA. Lower 9th ward representative right chea
Epic
Mannie Fresh mad underrated...im surprised the Tiny staff know all his songs 😂 im expecting everyone to be white

"You don't know how to use a triple beam HA?!"
Don't mind me im just back for my daily dose of Juvie and the crew 😂🎉
Cash Money 4 eva

Juve's energy coming through the screen so good
Beautiful men on this stage❤❤
Project Bish 16:06
Juvy  understood the assignment
Please bring Master P to us
Just brought me to tears. took me right back to 99 cruising down Central in Albuquerque, New Mexico. We bumped the f*** out of that juvie!!!! ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
The ABSOLUTE BEST......I can't stop watching it....
Sooooo good!! 🤗
Best thing ever right here, amazing!
I've watched this 5 times. JUvie what you drinking.
This has become one of my favorites performances.  I have never bought music from the Orleans collective but I knew also all these songs. I think what I loved about it the most was that they seemed like they was just chilling in their hood doing what they love.
Crazy how many Juve lyrics I know from the heart……
If the hot boys get together and make a tour…. It’ll be sold out…..
NPR made a hit…. Shout out to manny fresh…. Dude don’t get enough credit for creating a sound of an era
Oooo this might rival the freddie gibbs set
And i didn't think them soungs could be better great job you can tell hes really in it 2
I watch this everyday at least twice.
Juvenile why you had to take me back I'm trying to live right😅
🔥
Got me twerking in my "cubicle," I see you NPR. Giving the Usher tiny desk a challenge for the 'best to do it!!' ❤❤ Someone coined this "elegantly ratchet," but I think it was more sophisticated rachet and bringing in the Phil Harmonic for strings to accompany the horns, keys, and beat machine without editing the language added to the complexity and musicality that is HIP-HOP (50 years) and urban life.
Wow!
Nice.  Now  want to go to one of his shows.  Juvie🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 ❤❤❤
This is Real Artistry....
Perfect 10 outta 10
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The intro still 🔥
And it kept getting better by the minute!
Hold UP...I WASNT ready.....1. THANK YOU! Im at work this is a college flashback that 99-2000...whew I can hardly contain myself!! Im with @drolli1234...give them a RAISE immediately. Good thing I can close the door in my office....this is AWESOME
I'll be watching this regularly for the rest of my life. Juvey is a living legend
We needed this!!!! Juvie & Mannie Fresh 👏🏾🔥🔥🫶🏾
4th time back to watch‼️🎉🎉🎉🎉
Best one ever hands down
Cash Money Records still taking over for the 99 & 2000‼️
The hardest CD cash money put out is this right here please believe you couldn't go anywhere without hearing this LoL the whole album slap
Soooooooo it's VERY safe to say Juvie, Manny Fresh, eerbody that was apart of this Tiny Desk need to do a LIVE album!!! NOOOOOWWW!!! ❤❤❤
I love everything about this, and agree with everything every one else has said, BUT bro on the keys just living life and taking it all in is so wholesome
❤
Thank you, Tiny Desk! I needed this.
This is my third time watching. Quickest 28 minutes of my life lol
This was a great great set! Excellently executed❤❤❤❤😊
I want to see Sada Baby do this
this is taking me back to my childhood/early teens when cash money absolutely dominated the airwaves. good times man.
I've been listening to this while I work on repeat. I need this as a vinyl ! This is the most elder millennial thing ever, it's perfect!
Jon Baptiste’s reaction to that trombone riff at 21:38 was absolutely necessary. I had the same EXACT reaction.
The BEST tiny desk performance EVER!!!!!!!!
Play at 0.75 to extend your enjoyment. Or at least to watch more of the Amours.
That 400 drop....🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Woahdy i caught you wearing a masonic tie you caught that 🔫🔫🔫
ENCORE!!!!! Juvenile and Mannie Fresh!!!!
Stwingzzzz from Louizzianaz own!!!
It’s the group attire for the whole Performance 😍🥹😭😭😭
I put this on in the car and just ride around smiling. That’s that NOLA vibe❣️🔥
Mannie the best producer, hype man💛🖤
I'm so glad I watched this🤗
A master class! Thanks Juve.
Juvenile is a DMX from South
*”legend!” 🔥🔥🔥 - MELL DUNEY 616*

LOVED THIS! The memories!😍
The 400 Degreez beat is basically the Zelda 2 NES dungeon theme repurposed.
Are there any albums or artists anyone can recommend with similar instrumentation in this genre?
This was AWESOME !
See that 98 Mercedes…. Has it been that long?!? 😮🤦🏽‍♂️
When’s the TOUR?!!!!!!!!
Juve genuinely looks happy here. That makes me smile.
Magnolia..home of da souljas 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾🤙🏾🤙🏾🤙🏾🤙🏾
45 secs in. He looks like a kid again.   What a wonderful concert
This made me so proud to say I'm from Louisiana!
That was great I was surprised by how many songs I know❤
Thank you NPR ALL of us GenX hip-hop heads love this! Flowers for the artists that set the backdrop for our youth all the way to today.

Juvie sounds the exact same as he does on records. Tough to do that when rapping, it's impressive.
❤

This needs to be an album and available to purchase asap
Yea! That was good!
The energy in the room is undeniable.
This mf was lit🔥🔥
Iconic
Wow this is Hip Hop SOUL

Never thought I'd be smiling ear to ear the entire set yet here i am 😊
Lol! Juvie literally did the jordan peele Obama on the strings duo.
Love this!!!
めっちゃ良い❤曲自体も良いし、ジュヴナイル、パフォーマンスが上手い‼️
Have not stopped playing this.  So good
Hands down the best so far
During the rise of Cash Money I thought Juvvy was going to have the career that Wayne had. What happened? No dis.  I am not saying that Waynes not talented I just think that Juvvy is better.
Just ❤
That 400 degrees track Is just fire! I must have came back to listened to it over 30 times by now. I actually like this version better then the original. Fire!
Perfect perfect ❤🎉😊
Juvi Da GREAT! Mannie Freshhhh ain't no slouch either!!

NOLA 🎉
Magnolia Juve! The Greatest Ever
The only thing they missing is Lil Wayne, this was off the chain 🔥🔥
That Encore was everything..  Juvie we need more muisc and a concert. Ill pay anything to see you.
Juve is one of the most underrated MCs out there.  Better than most.
Juve Goat
They made a short out of your comment @Krolli1234
This isn't the first time you've watched this.
The only tiny desk I’ve ever watched.
Soooo good! Can’t wait to see him next Sunday with Three 6 Mafia, Ying Yang Twins, Silkk The Shocker, others at Southern Smoke Summer Fest!!
This Tiny Desk is the perfect rollout for a tour, same band same sound, all the old hits, think this tour won't sell out! This was the tiny desk we didn't know we needed!!!
This like my 400 time watching this lol😂 let’s go 25th anniversary of 400 Degrees….
💎💎💎🎶🎶🎶🎤🎤💵🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥☀️☀️☀️☀️
The horns are such a New Orleans feel.  Love it
I’m 40 yrs old.  And I swear, there’s no other Producer like Manny.  This dude changed Music.    I appreciate all the hard work these dudes have done.  Serious Big Timers.
Best to date, had me laughing and dancing all the way through 🔥 🔥 🔥
Refreshing in 2023!
the smiles :) so good ty juve
sometimes I want to put this on as background music but I can’t not watch the video because it’s so nice/refreshing seeing people who look genuinely excited about performing. they just look so happy lol
missed the hit ..u understand ,my fav.
I loved it. Juvenile has that deep Louisiana Creole Frog voice 💛💜💚💛💜💚💛
CASH MONEY IS AN ARMY!! LOVED THIS 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Juvie was the most talented on cash money to bad he didn't get to put out more music.
The strings players are like “four years at Juilliard led to this moment!”
Living my whole life in New Orleans, CMB is actually main reason why I listen to rap. When the reunion happen, if there anything I would like to hear, it would be the following: B.G. - I Know        Juvenile - I Got that Fire Turk - Freak Da Hoes Lil' Wayne - Get Off The Corner Big Tymers - Millionaire Dreams.  Baller Blockin'  These track are underated.
Props to Josh Connelly on guitar. Some tasty licks coming through.
Taking no prisoners.
🙌🏽👏🏽
This is freakin' incredible.
Dat boy on 🔥 400 degreez
They had a great showing. One of the best!
16:00 😂

One of the best ones to come out in a while!
Best tiny desk yet!! They sound literally the same as in the songs!! Authentic and it sounds good af!
YO those back up vocals were fire
Me and Juve same age.  Felt sick hearing him spit that 1999 driver line from Bling Bling @3:47
New Orleans born and raised and we cuts up!! Too proud of Juvie and cash money as a whole.
Mannnnn this was super LIT ❤️‍🔥🔥 S/O TO JUVIE & MANNIE and THE BAND ❤️✊🏾
Love Love Love ❤

My year has been made. Thank you.

God hearing Manny an Juv its a vibe.
This is amazing! Made me happy seeing this!!
This is amazing! Made me happy seeing this!!
I have only heard the radio versions of these songs  😊 and by the look on Jon Baptiste's face for Project Chick  I don't think he is too comfortable  with the unedited versions 😊 or maybe he's playing all innocent and shy. They killed it!!! When he joined the crowd, that was best part. He got them hyped up. They  showed up and showed out.  Okay!!!!
NOLA REPRESENT
This is the best Tiny Dest Concert so far.  From a rap fan..
this will be preserved in the library of Congress soon enough🤞
Well played Juve…Much Respect from Houston Tx
Soo Refreshing!! 🎯💯 still sounds the same too! I enjoyed it 4 sho !
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I'm speechless! Tiny Desk you have had my attention for a long time now, and I've loved it. I'm a live girl; everything live should be better. BUT BAYBEE you done bought out my 1992 baby zaddy, and I am so thankful. I loved every second of this.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
When we removed our NY bias, we realized how much dope music other cities had!!! I wish in the 80s and 90s, us New Yorkers were more open to other regions.
Juvie on dat juvie juice. Peep the drink.
This gave me hope for America
❤️❤️
This desk tho
Rip slim! They killed that slow motion 💯💯💯💯
Yassss!!! Tha boot in tha house!!!
These Tiny Desk Concerts are AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I was in the 1st grade the first time I heard BTAU! You know the song fire when you remember the first time you heard it at 7 years old😩
NPR for the win
This is tight as #@#@! What an awesome sound with the horns and all!
I put this on whenever I need a pick-me-up.. he's having a blast and his energy is contagious.
Why is this on npr it’s disgusting promoting bad values vilionce crime and treating woman bad
He forgot about bounce back
I didn't expect to be listening to  Juvie all day yet here we are
Print that!
They bodyed bodies this
Lil wayne ????¿???¿???????????????¿?????????
masterful
In the flesh. Still steaming up
We need a big money millionaires reunion tour
This was the "lit-est" TDC...EVER!!!
And that was a HELLUVA ENDING!!!!. Thankful for the, "ONE MORE TIME!!!"
Wazzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzuppppppp
Enjoyed the performance. Very well thought out and put together.
Playing this in the car and it sounds magnificent
Who is the drummer !?
Listening for the 10x time since this release. They're insaneee  Editing a week later, still listening on my sound system. Badasss  5 weeks in, video reached 5m views!  It will hit 6m soon!  Year later it's 9m 🤟
absolute classic. vinyl this immediately
me in the mini van with the kids in the back saying bling bling!!!😅
Perfection🔥🔥🔥
WOW!!!
My vibe watching this can be described by npr shirt wearing individual at 9:24-9:28 😄
B.G. bing bing still cold
Lordt i enjoyed every bit of this… ❤❤❤❤my error
ENCORE!!! That was Amazing! And so much fun... Salute to Legendary Juvenile & Mannie Fresh and the whole band.
by the best TINY DESK CONCERT ive seen
If this gets more views imagine the hot boys cash money days
Excellent show! 💯
The talent here is CRAZY especially all of the beautiful Angel Voices!
This is my first time really listening to the real version of project chick lol…. I’ve always heard the clean version 😮
Best tiny desk ever. Juvenile has some Muddy Waters Howlin Wolf energy to him these days. Dude is such a professional.
The installation of instruments is so New Orleans  I love it man !
This is the greatest thing to touch this platform, thank you to this channel Fs you deserve your flowers all of you
Back that a$$ up is the the one dude 😅😅😅
Yessssss 😂😂Lol this is the best thing that’s happened this year ❤❤❤
That was hard.
Dope
This is awesome!!!! Everyone participating and watching is enjoying this❤️ Need more of these
DOPE
How do we get Kendrick Lamar to do Tiny Desk next?!?
Dang… I feel old
Get it Juvi!!!
Juvie understood the assignment!!!! 🔥🔥🔥
Juve had the 99, 2000s on 🔒!!!Cash Money Records still my favorite all time label!!! Way to go🔥 🔥 🔥!!! Free Baby Gangsta‼️
I literally get chills watching this! It came together so beautifully !!!!
Gotta say I agree with everyone, best Tiny Desk concert ever, EPIC set! Think i've watched this at least 10 times haha.
GWAR, Cypress Hill and Juvenile 🤯🤯🤯🤯MVTO MVTO for these great bands
Juvie and Mannie take up so much of my Spotify Playlist. Juvie has got to be one of the hardest hitting southern rappers of all time, and Mannie is the REASON anyone from the cash money days got as big as they are; his skills as DJ and producer are absolutely iconic. I say bring Mannie back and let him throw some of his solo work; the whole Mind of Mannie Fresh album is such a fun time and I advise anyone who likes what they hear to listen to it. Love seeing Louisiana get some recognition up north, and ESPECIALLY love seeing these two powerhouses got all these DC folk singing right along with them! I couldn't stop myself from going word for word neither!
Something special right here.
4 million views is crazy in two weeks!!!!!😮
The keyboardist looks like Nipsey and it’s blowing my mind
And the way Juvie came RIGHT WITH THE HEAT!!!❤❤🎉 400° 🔥
Absolutely incredible!!!
Ratchet and Regal! Juve and Mannie...🔥
I just wish I could 👍 it twice
I saw a meme once saying "Manny Fresh look like someone lesbian Auntie" i cant un-see it now 🤣🤣🤣
JUVIE!!!!!!
Didnt realize juvi had all them hits...sheeesh
One of the best Tiny Desk ever
you know it's been 2 weeks since I first watched. I've now watched this front to back 4 times now. It's the best Tiny Desk concert yet
At 17:37 the musician looks at the guy beside him and says “my baby mama” 😂
Never knew I needed this, this much♥️
Lit 🔥
this is so fire!!!
Ok NPR!!!! STEPPING IT UP! This was a classic. Im going to see Juvi in August and im so excited!
@tinydesknpr please bring on PROJECT PAT next 🙏🏾!!!!!!!
Thanks Juvie!!!! You Mannie and the band killed it. Nothing like live instrumentation, exceptional vocals and crowd participation!!!! Plus a ENCORE yes indeed NPR best Tiny Desk so far.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Yez zirrrrr!!
This was really well done. The band was great and it just flowed so well. This has nola written all over it.
Signed sealed delivered
the most entertainment while watching my phone screen. Like ever.
Reunion pls while they all alive

I no wat I'm gunna be playin in my car for awhile now 😂 just needed this remindwe but please believe i never forgot these classics . Big ups to juvy an mannie fresh
The most classy ghetto ever!😂😭I love it fr!!!
Not saying this is the best, but it’s def my current favorite. Wish I was there
So sad my children will have to get lucky to get actual artist like this. Sad the content distracts from how talented hip hop is
Why am I about to cry listening to Juvie and his background ladies singing “Rodeo” lol🥲. Ahhhh, this is taking me back. Dope Tiny Desk.
Greatest tiny desk 💯. The memories overwhelmingly took me over
Still 400°
Chills yo. Been a minute since i listen to juv. This vibe was crazy

OMG! I just can't stop watching ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💜💜💜🤍🤍👑👑👑
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I have a strong erge to let him get me pregnant after watching this 😂❤❤.
This is amazing
Brilliance
And there you have it, the good, the bad, and the beauty of Louisianan culture Just like Tank and The Bangaz, authentic and unapologetic ❤️💯
Greatest love song ever written 😂
That random white guy with the celo and the Asian girl with the violin had me rollin😂🤣😂🤣
Great set.
Manny and Juvi seem genuinely happy and having a blast 💥….
Juve needed this more than we knw… good stuff NPR!!!
So glad he performed Rodeo
Manny doesn’t get enough credit for being such a great musician.
Memories....   Real rap.....Thanks J & M....
Rodeo one of my favorite songs frfr
Oh man... this brings me all the nostalgia like 106 & park, Rap City... good ol' times. Early 2000's had a lot of classic hiphop songs of all time.
WHO Verzuz Juve the Great??? NOBODY!!!
Still rocking them grills 😂😂
This goes so stupidly hard. Wish we could resurrect dmx for a tiny desk.
Girrllll on that violin slid right on with the crew plucking that tone!
Best Tiny Desk ever, no lie!
this was the best!
I feel like whenever B.G. Come home this is where the hot boys reunion show should be
Let make a quick run to Odyssey  Records on Canal St.....lol
manny hasnt lost a step at all
Brings me back to 4th grade so nostalgic
Dope
I love being from New Orleans. We are just different.
All they needed was Wayne
Juvie and Manny represent New Orleans culture 247! Keep pushing for the lil brothers from the bottom of the map. Respect and love from the NOLA.
Appreciate the talent man,you don’t get solid hip hop like this anymore 🎉
Raise your hand if you have watched this more than 3 times like I have😭
Sheesh, manz did not disappoint
New Orleans!!! Bounce
My fav tiny desk yet
Ayyye slow motion and rodeo is lit 🔥 🔥🔥💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💯👌🏾👏🏾
Three weeks later and every listen is as good as the first; each second is art.
This is sooooo dope!!! Man I did not know how much I needed this in my life!! Dam I’m having a good time!!
Everyone had fun!
Absolutely perfect 🤣 Had me smiling the whole time
You can tell Mannie Fresh still loves producing music
I feel like Juvie was slept on a little.  He is much better than his hype in hip hop
Kyle there at 9:25 ain’t playing. I think he had Becky throwing that back later that night
This my fifth time  watching, getting better every time
Yesterday's price......
Best 28+ minutes of my life! Thanks fellas for bringin it in and layin it down!! 🔥
Yooooo!   This is everything.  Lol
I'm here because I've watched this countless times now.  I CAN'T GET ENOUGH!  This was so nostalgic for me, taking me back to my hot girl days (shhh!!!!!).  This was one of the best-ever Tiny Desks!  I'm sure I'll be back next LOL
He should have written with Lin Manuel for Hamilton
🐐🐐🐐
I enjoyed this so much  I'm back to this again  Looool  Pure Dope  🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Man we thought this was mumble rap. His flow masculine,today's rappers Estrogen!👏🔥🙏✊️
9:25 - You singing all the lyrics too my guy?🤣🤣🤣🤣
Shout out to Mannie Fresh though…musical genius for sure!
5th time I’ve listened to this all the way through - I’m sure I’ll be back
Omg love ❤
As a 43 year old man who lived in the Midwest, these men sung the soundtrack of my life.   Effortless.  Instant top 10 all time tiny desk.
ICONIC 🔥 brought me back, this is what the games been missing. New wack rappers need to take notes 📝
Juvie rocked the desk man. Been a fan of his for a long time. Well done and deserved.
NPR off the heezy
Best tiny desk hands down   Good job boyz!!!
Mannie Fresh is a vibe. When Mannie smiles I smile. Best TDC ever
This feels so wholesome despite the content of the music.
❤ love this tiny desk session cause juvenile was lit and still is... He pave a way in this industry too.... Love the last part though him and Mannie fresh came from behind the desk cause you can see the love between brothers that they have and making hits ❤❤

It’s crazy all the smiles here but you know in the club everyone was muggin back then

Can I ask please and I’m not being rude I’m not from USA he says “n” word a lot is that allowed?
this made me so happy, didn't even feel like 28 mins, wish it was more! thank you for the encore at the end.
Back again 🥴🥴 I done watched this like 7 times already 😂
I was smiling the entire time watching this!! Loooove
These two guys have a great vibe together they compliment each other. It's magically causing the to come hard.
Manny Fresh looking like a lesbian Morgan Freeman these days 😅😂

I need a friend that hypes me like mannie fresh
I so needed this❤
Im going back in for a 2nd round tonight.
Glad to see Mannie with him! Happy he did the classics.
I've rewatched this and want to give a huge shout out to the backing band performances. Everyone involved went off.
Bring back memory
AI couldn’t do dis!
This is a total vibe he should do a small tour just like this no tracks or dj
They’re all about to make a mint off of those kiddos discovering Rodeo
Best tiny desk❤
Anyone between 35 & 45 are looping this video every day
This was a cultural experience.
Absolutely timeless set. Brought me back to hearing these cuts blasting out my brother’s room. He’s responsible for my love of Juve and all the Hot Boys. Get your flowers Juve and Mannie!!! 💪🏽💪🏽
I want to see what Jon Batiste saw at 25:40 😮😊
Never knew I needed this in my life
That was great. Imma download the album now. Thanks
Yard heard me whoadi
So this is officially one of my fav TDCs.
❤Love Juvenile Energy 24-7!🙌🏾🎉🔥🔥🔥🔥🏋🏿‍♀️
When Mannie Fresh turned the mic around and got in the crowd!!!!
that piano on slow motion💆🏾‍♂️🥹
I have got to get me some Juvie juice!!!!
I'm so sweaty from dancing around my living room 🔥🔥🔥
I’ve watched this about ten times brings me back to HS days. I wish this version of 400 degrees was on Apple Music…
This man right "chere came to Lexington Kentucky, with a back pack on...Sat that backpack down and proceeded to tear it up.  He put on an awesome show..everybody got outta there seats! Love Juve❤❤
2 weeks and I'm still not over this performance. Execution, crowd involvement, song selection, production. Ughh so good.
Still bringing that fire! 🔥 🔥  This set is timeless. Dope af
That was fun…coo!
This is fantastic
a TINY DESK CLASSIC
It’s the ENCORE that you would of thought you needed!!!! I literally watch this 3-5 times a day 😩
The only way Tiny Desk can top this is they find a way to bring Lil Wayne.
YESSSSSSSSSSSSS NOLA YES YES YES
This that drink your crown in a tea cup with your pinky finger up. The most clatchet (classy ratchet) sound ever... AND I M HERE FOR ALL OF IT ❤❤❤
KERENNNNNN
I love everything about this concert. Juve is truly the greatest ❤
Mannie Fresh has always been a top tier producer! 💪🏾💯
When he brings out the Grammy winners, what is one playing on? Little keyboard thing that he blows into?
Repeating Best Live Performance Grammy.
This could only be better if he wore a tuxedo. High art🔥🔥
The keyboard playa looking like a buff Nipsey 🏁
Juvenile on tiny desk?

Reminds me of how far I’ve come! Thank you! ❤️❤️❤️
Wish I could give this a million likes. Watched this so many times. The best Tiny Desk ever!!!!!!
So good!!!
Dope my favorite from cash money
A lot of folks don’t know that Cash Money Record’s most successful album was “400 Degreez”. Juvie is a legend. Point blank.
Best tiny desk thus far 1992 baby
I needed something to shower to- Perfect!!!!
The 400 degreez as intro !  🔥 🔥🔥
This is ridiculously good!
Your a paper chaser you got your block on fire?
I have watched this multiple times. Give the folks who made this happen a big raise. Thank you Tiny Desk.
🔥 JUVY LEGENDARY 🔥 👊🏽 💣 💥 🏆 ❤
Yes I vote give them a raise too. Juvenile looks really good.  I went to a concert a few years ago and I was concerned about  him. But he looks totally different.  Glad to see he's better.  Big shot out to Manny fresh. He hanging right in there with him.
what I wouldn't have given to be a part of that audience 😭 so amazing! what an incredible performance 🎉
I had to watch it again because it gave me so much joy!

Timmy in the front knowing all the words! Yes Timmy!
Mannie Fresh never gets enough credit for his production and contribution to Hip Hop!
They Aging like Fine Cognac!
I think this is one of the best ones I've seen. I loved this Tiny desk!!!

👏🏿 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿 Juvenile, Mannie Fresh and the Band
For the 99s and 2000s…….. 🤞🏾❤️

Only way to top this is to bring  Cash Money together.  Or Master P or something a long those lines.
MY FAVE ONE SO FAR!!!
I put it off until I saw him live so that I wouldn't be walking around lusting to see him. Now this will get me through.
He's the South DMX
Ok it’s the BET kids that love this. I didn’t get the same feeling
I wasn’t expecting them to start off with the 400 Degreez Intro😢 CLASSIC
I remember when this was the guy and lil wayne was just his lil bro !
Older rap hitting harder nowadays  !
That boy album bout to go platinum again in 2023 💯🔥💪🏿
I lived almost 38 years on this earth just to see 26:54 - 27:00 God bless Mannie Fresh ❤
This was the greatest Tiny Desk concert of all time, and it’s not even close 🏆
At 20:00 the vibe in the office is incredible, another track that is so good with live musicians it's getting transcended. Even better at 24:00 OMG !
The setup made Juve sound like a spoken word artist 🤣. This was 🔥
Coldest ish on YouTube right now
8 million views and half of them are from me.......
Needa 2 hour tiny desk for Juvi
Man my child hood lol manny fresh looking hela old man
10:28 the best song
Young Juve and Fresh probably never would have believed they'd get their roses on NPR in their later years.  🙏🙂
GEN Z WOULDNT BE ABLE TO HANDLE THIS
25:40 BRUH JON'S FACE LOL mans looks like he's just SEEN something LOL
Love when they played an encore, the band was like, YEAH, we’ve played this 13 times the last two days. LETS ROLL!!
One more time 😂
❤
Didn't drop it like it's hot. :'(
Holy Cow this is amazing ! Please keep droppin Tiny Desk's with OG's of the rap game like the amazing Gucci Mane and Zaytoven episode y'all did!!
This is amazing ❤😢
This is a top 5 tiny desk performance along with Mac, paak, Tyler, this, and usher
More like this!
How much a tiny desk show cost? I would watch paint dry during one of these sets at this point.
I’m so happy for Juvenile. He seems so humble and in pure joy!❤❤❤❤
Appreciate these men while they alive….. greatness/ talent
Felt like I was on the lawn at the local amphitheater enjoying some classics
This is legit insanity. Best TV concert I’ve ever seen.
Mannie got me dead at the end 😂. Good vibes.
Hot Boys was bumping.
I wish I was in the audience bouncing to Juv, Fresh, the Amours and the band. Great Tiny Desk 👏🏽.
He should have performed noila clap.
0:54 that’s my shyt!
Yesterday prices are not today prices
Watched again!❤
Show this at the MoMA. This is some of the finest art produced from The South and America period.
This was one of the best.
Juvie had as much fun as the audience
best yet in so long
The two ladies voices are so beautiful ❤️
Juvie DEFINITELY need to drop a live album of his greatest hits   Wayne ended up being the biggest star but Juvenile reminded people that he has CLASSICS and probably the better overall catalog
New Orleans is a big part of hip hop history. I thoroughly enjoyed this 💯💪
Excellent ❤
Man this is straight 🔥
Perfect
This makes you connect to Juv on a whole different level, amazing show.
I didn't know I needed this in my life, I did💯
You know it's fire when Juvenile gets asks to do an encore with an orchestra!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
PERFECTION 🎉
This is probably the best tiny desk since Mac Miller
No waaaayyyyyyy!!!!!!! I’m screaming!!!!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤ I still play 400degrees!!
First concert was in 4th grade Ruff Ryders & Cash Money with my momma. I’ll live n die a rap fan.
Nice surprise, the band was tight, Horns nice, Background singers were Great, Juvenile , put on a Great Tiny Desk Concert, Loved Mannie's skills,

Mannie Fresh really helped bring this together. You can tell how proud he is of the music he made for Juve. I know every song word for word like the back of my hand. I know the world love Juvenile but it was way different if you grew up in the hood back in the day
‘Cause to me/MC means MOVE the CROWD 🎤 Hats off to the master of these NPR ceremonies—Juvie!!!! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Just stumbled up on this and was like... Alright now!!!!😂  "Set it off in this mutha!!!!"
Not even a juvenile fan but this is nice
Haven’t watched a whole tiny desk in a long while. I knew all the songs. Didn’t realize I was a juvenile fan 😂 loved it.
Yes i really needed this very nice!!! About watch again lol
Watching Juvie was sooooo much fun. He really enjoyed this experience 😊
Do I need to state the obvious and that lil Wayne should be next?
The ending of that when Mannie went into the crowd was 🐐
Chills and bumps. Thanks
Who is the guy on the keyboard?? He looks sooooo familiar but idk.
Can you go ahead and please do one with Justin Timberlake. I’ll Preciate it
I KEEP WATCHING THIS!!!!! Soundtrack to a great time in my life
This is just   ಡ⁠ ͜⁠ ⁠ʖ⁠ ⁠ಡ
Bro mannie fresh need his flowers them beats a fool
I thought I was at Tipitina's for a moment... 🔥🔥🔥
Our music has come along way when you get violins in the mix
F-ing dope
One of my all time favorite rappers. It's nice to hear his flow live. He still got it.
Legendary right here Juvie
That Juvie Juice started to kick in around 17:00
Juvie brought out the big guns with Trombone Shorty and Jon Batiste, those two are legends
wow, that Rodeo performance was beautiful
Good times 99 ❤
You still sound great Juvie and Mannie! The band right there made such a difference, nice job!! 🙌🥂
Top 3 Tiny Desks performance ever
this is great, but the videography and the way it is edited is garbage. Takes away from the artist we came to see. We dont need close ups of the band behind him. cmon...
One of the best from the South to evvvveeerrr!!! do it
Love when the Tiny Desk audience sings along 🔥
3 rd comment 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣almost  @ 4 mil views doe this bay my 5th time watching this
This was so good!
Took me back to my HBCU days (Jackson State University). I enjoyed this wayyyyy too much LOL Lets go JUVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Still fire!
That was amazing!!!!!!
Top 5 Tiny Desk! Hands down!
I love this. First off, the bassist looks like he’s in heaven and then I love that they’re mixing more modern music production with horns. They’re mixing the old with the new. ❤
Gave dat n*gga a encore👏🏾
This is an award winning performance. Maybe the best tiny desk ever, So authentic. This is artistic perfection. Brilliant, whoever said yes to this and made it happen. I hope this is something my local NPR and other make known. It’s our culture, where we came from and who we are. Culture is relevant and valuable
This is great ❤ nothing but love
Who knew we needed a Juvenile Tiny Desk? That person deserves to always get green lights, have an 800 credit score and tacos that are always fresh.  What's next?!
I’m really hoping that the camera pans over to the crowd 😭
This is a 100000/10 ! JUVE !!
I've been watching tiny desk forever and this is the best one ever 🔥🔥🔥
Two of the most iconic, recognizable voices in hip-hop
This may be second only to the original 2017 Tank and the Bangas tiny desk, if you haven't listened to that, head right there!
this is one of the best tiny desk concerts
Much needed👏🏽
and here I go again….. watching this masterpiece for the 7th time lol. Classic performance right here.
Juve had me whipping out my chain screaming "Bling, Bling!" Manny as a DJ/Producer is unfuckwitable
Fire
love it
Mannie with those beats n on that mic 🎤
Never have I ever needed something so much in my life that I never asked for God bless you Tiny Desk
He's so daddy
Just NASTY! WOOOOOOOOOO!!!!
Great choice tiny desk got me jamming once again, love the old school artists it really takes me back
See what happens when you listen to your audience!!! Well played NPR, well played!!!!
This is the best Tiny Desk ever. Charlie is #2
Gotta Love Mannie Fresh the greatest producer of all time from the dirty south
That set was straight 🔥
Mannie Fresh one of the greatest producers of all time. Juvenile killing it as always.

😂😂😂 go brazy
I need this band as my Live band 🎉
16:02 best part of the concert
Y’all know Beyoncé was in this comment section 🌸🌷🌻
Mannie and juvenile are 2of the most underrated of my generation
This one is up there with Mac Millers appearance as one of the best!
Brought me back to my teenage years in New Orleans riding around bumping juvenile and the Hot boys.The only thing that would have made it better was if wayne,turk and geezy was there and spit some them fire versus too.
This was one for the books! Juvenile turned Tiny Desk out! Ya heard! ❤
Juvie had a classic performance on here
Came back because it felt like my birthday and I'm 21-22 again🤩😍🥰💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥

That Rodeo performance might have been the best tiny desk I’ve ever heard.
And the Grammy goes to Juvenile and Mannie Fresh ❣️
Oh my Gawd!!!
So fire and fully grown!!☺️☺️
This was Gold!!!
GOT THEM SOLDIER RAGS ON, THIS IS NICE FOR GOING BACK DOWN HOOD LANE FOR PEOPLE
Amazing

Dope
8:00 is start of slow motion ‼️‼️
This whole performance was legendary but that last song is how you rock the Mf crowd and that first song they transitioned perfectly from calm to straight to it really a hall of fame level 🥹
Oh yesss JUVIEEEEEE 🎉Classical Rap 🫰🏾
🔥🔥🔥🔥
This was great 👍
🔥🔥🔥
Took me back.... Good times .... true talent... raw talent from the boot 👢 baby. Rep the south too hard... They took over the rap game back then...
it’s like seeing my favorite two hood uncles after years . 😩 we needed this and it was well deserved
Blessings to you, YeS 👏🏿👏🏿
Wow he aged well❤
I never really listened to Juvenile years ago but now… ! They jammed the whole show.  I enjoyed it.
NGL I haven’t listened to an entire Tiny Desk…. Til this one!☝️ 🤌
I absolutely love my era... It's eternal...
Pure🔥. Happy to see these two together. Juvenile you need to take this crew (live band and singers) on the road.
Wow!
They lit 🔥 🤪 🤣
🔥
Listen 🎧 the Tiny desk we didn’t know we needed!! I’m at work bobbing my a$$ off!!
Can somebody give the pianist my number 🙃
Great to see juvie and mannie in this
Here after seeing him in Indianapolis and I absolutely loooove him his energy is EVERYTHING ❤
Like a old school New Orleans DJ in the project with a formal crowd
The best Tiny Desk Yet! Luv Juvie and Manny Fresh!
This was good for the soul, preciate everybody who was involved 💯 I needed this 🤝🏽
I smiled thee entire time! Thanks for this Juve and NPR! Reminded me of my best years as a teen…singing along, dancing, having fun! The band was amazing.❤️ and who is this gorgeous man on bass??? Please and thank you. 😂
🔥🔥🔥
🤟🏾🫶🏽🔥🔥
I was on vacation in Miami with my parents when "Slow Motion" dropped. What a time to be alive. That song was EVERYWHERE.
mannie fresh never gets old...
He lit this tiny desk up 🔥🔥🔥 the best I’ve saw !
Incredible
How did this not break the internet?❤
P
Love the energy! UTP 4 Life!
This should be a full fledged tour

So lively and fun!! Great job everyone!!!
Auntie Mannie Fresh always bring that energy 😂
This music aged like fine wine.
This is one of the most exquisitely ratchet beautiful necessary things I have ever seen.
White girl violenist invited to cook out
🔥 🔥 🔥
This really showed how much Juvi and Mannie played a part in CMG.
Ah. Nothing like audible rap
Loved the Nolia Clap song transition. That brought back some old memories! Would have loved a surprise visit from Wayne on the Go DJ song! Great performances from Juv & Manny Fresh ❤
Juve got the best Tiny Desk concert and it’s not even close
Juvie really has timeless music !
Fuhhhhhkin 🔥🔥🔥

Mannie Fresh = best hype man
Man this is so dope. I wish I could send this to my brother. RIP
Ain’t nobody told me nothing!!!    This came past my timeline too many times but I was afraid it was gone be trash. Biiiiihhhhh they kilt this!
The songs I grew up too, the young girl that played these songs on her stereo system danced with joy!
This is the best thing I’ve seen on YouTube in months. Thank you.
Between this and Usher.... Juvie and Mannie the truth
excusez moi
I’m only subbing cause y’all really got JUVE on this hoe 😂😂😂

No time stamp man is crazy … Guess I’ll do it 🙄
CASH MONEY TAKING OVER FOR THE 99-2000
I know we gone and got real jobs but this was a fun time in a lot of our middle-College years!
Incredible.
This Tiny Desk made my soul smile like grandmas cooking
Best ever Tiny
JUVE tha great 🇯🇲🖤
Best ever Tiny Desk?!!
Omg now this was iconic
JUVIE GOT BAR'S 🔊🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👏👏👏
Man this took me back to 13 listening to 400 Degreez on repeat everything night. Juve still in  my top 2 favorites.
The crowd wasn’t doing enough for me
Thanks for doing this legendary performance Juvie & Mannie!❤
I didn't know I could twerk to Tiny Desk
I set my phone down and let the entire thing play 🔥
This was absolutely brilliant, amazing, classic.. but the omission of "in my life" is a crying shame. 20/10 performance tho. A celebration.
Wow. I'm at a loss of words. Shout out to Juvenile, Mani, and the band. That energy was crazy.
What instrument is Baptiste playing?  Also. What an incredible live performance!
MANNNNNNNNN……… 🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐
History in the making
Brought back great memories with this.
What a great performance from all involved.  Juve the Great
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
What’s crazy is that the live versions of these songs feels authentically New Orleans to me! I think Juvie should release a live album version of greatest hits! Love love love this! Long overdue.
For some reason i believe the white guy in the NPR t-shirt made this happen...
A true Legend. Salute.
This is amazing!! And im glad they kept it uncensored because thats how it should be
Juvenile carried cash money in the beginning,,he foreal put cash money on with 900 degrees!!! Carried all them boyz on his back in the beginning!!!!
Ion think he knew how much he was appreciated until he did this...I love this
Juvenile still sound the same from when I grew up love hearing him again
Idk jaguar wright was a feature😂
I’m vibing with it!!!
Please YouTube PAY the artists & NPR more for streams ! Dis truly QUALITY CONTENT 🌟
Love me some Juvanile and the HOT BOYZ 🔥🔥🔥
Juve still got it. So underrated
Fuvkin legends
I remember jamming 400 degreez in my first car as a Jr. in HS! All great songs, happy to see he still has it!
They was cuttin all the way up! This took me back to my childhood. The only bad thing about this is it had to end
Naaaaaaaaah 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
This sh*t so good I want a whole live album!!! A tour!!
I love Juvie!! ❤
Loved this! So fresh. ❤
Was waiting for Wayne to pop outtah nowhere in the end
Man, brings back so many Memories!!!! Juve has agreed really  Well!!! Fresh & Juve Brought  us some Classics!!!!
Man listen he didn’t miss one lyric that says a lot
Iconic. Legendary. SO necessary 💯
I love Louisiana from New Orleans, Baton Rouge, Opelousas to Lafayette! The best place on earth.  From I-10 to Hwy 190 ❤
I have no words! Actually speechless 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Manny fresh > dj khaled  We can agree on this for years from now. It will still be the truth.
👏👏🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Does the first song have a Zelda II base?
😢😢 YEAAAAA THAT MADE 2023 WORTH IT 🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿
more of this.  amazing
Fireeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!!!!!
You can tell Mannie love what he doing!!
Brought back so many memories 🔥💃🏽
I can't stop watching this.❤❤❤
Classic...
This shows how important live instruments are versus a computer. This is so classy. I love this. He could have released this as new music and I would have bought it.
Humbly disagree.    Slow Motion is the greatest love song of our generation.  Outkast needs to be next on Tiny Desk….let’s make it happen for humanity 😎
Man, I grew on cash money and juvie can still put it down. Mannnie too, dope AF to see this
the coolest thing about this, is he didnt know what tiny desk was and thought people were making fun of him. then he watched a video and said i have to do this an was on 2 weeks later
Love seeing a louisiana talent still thriving. That backing band is pure NOLA soul
Yaaaas sir! Y'all brought me back!!!!❤
This whole concert is that splaaaaaaa 🎉❤
That’s was FIRE!!!! Hands down my favorite! Legendary!
Loved every bit of it wish it was longer
I been waiting my whole life for this, and ain’t even know it! Bravo
Legend has it, he's still holding that can.
10/10 👏🏽 👏🏽
I wish I could give this video a like for every time that I have rewatched it and sang along!
New Orleans is full of flavor!
Mannie fresh brought that energy 13:20
Definitely need more explicit Tiny Desks. NPR got a W with that one. Keep it up. The culture always wins
this the hardest tiny tesk!!!!!
🔥 🔥
Is he the one that kept being accused of the R word?
JUVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ratchet and classy for the 99 and the 2000. This was the best Tiny Desk ever. Juvenile and Mannie Fresh will always be 🔥My new favorite tiny desk performance of all time.
Tiny Desk is goated for the run they went on this year. From Uncle Charlie, to Babyface, to Juvie The Great!
Electric
🔥👌🏾💯
3.7 million views and I think I watched it 1 million times 🤣. And didn’t sing She get it from her mama
Mannie!!!!! Lol!!! My dude!!!!
Do that sh.. Juvieee!!!!
You switched from nikes to reeboks ha?
I’ve always had a crush on Manie Fresh… Lawd… Djm! 🤣🤣🤣
Take it on tour Juvie
Issa vibe
Man!!!! This takes me back to my teenage years!!!  Super hyped watching this over and over again 😂
First time hearing Juvenile. Instant fan.
Lol
Why did all the lyrics just rush out of me like I was a teenager again! 😆 this was what everyone needed!
I’m so happy right now
A Tiny Desk concert with the entire Cash Money crew and go through the Cash Money catalogue.  With the entire band assembled.
We need No Limit on here. Whoever is still alive or isnt in jail
🙌🏾
I hung out with Juvie for about 2 minutes, 7 years ago. He wouldn't let me take us a selfie....he told his entourage to do it for us. Cool dude!
Yesssssss is all that I can say! Yes, yes, yes lol! Just yes! I just sent this to literally my whole family AND posted into our group chat 😂❤️🎉❤️🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🎉🎉❤️❤️
They did that shiii!!!
Definitely a highlight for the channel❤️‍🔥
I didn’t think I would watch all 28 minutes. But not only did I watch the whole thing, it’s on repeat.
Manny Fresh! My guy!!!!
Juvie!!!! Yessssss!!!❤❤❤❤
This is so amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Great show
Dude got hits who can verse battle with him !!!
So good!!❤
Juvenile pulled out all the stops, all the talent and created a masterpiece for the ages! 🎉🎉🎉🎉
🎉🎉Celebrate The Ol'Skool Artist While They Alive🎉🎉 Fire Tiny Desk Concert❤
Back for my third time today
Wow...l kept wishing the hotboys would run out...damm Juv did his thing
Yes, yes, yes I f--ks wth juvenile.  Young money been bussing.  NO underated for their contribution.  Love to my brother Boosie fan 4 life. Controversial but MYSTICAL WAS THE BADDEST TO COME FR NO., TOO BAD HIS CHOICES WERE LETHAL TO HIS CAREER. HIM AND BUSTA ARE ORIGINAL. U CAN'T COPY THEM IF U TRIED.  JUS MY OPINION
Unc still killin it! Love Juve and Mannie F!
Idk who told NPR to schedule Juvenile but it’s what we needed ❤big ups to Tiny desk 💯
This is why mainstream hip hop is so sexualized, because it gets views!
This was an incredible performance! I feel like everyone there and all of us watching thoroughly enjoyed Juvi. 400 degrees was a dangerous track in high-school 😂!
THIS INTRO WAS MY FAVORITE . MIND BLOWN IT WAS FIRST
This is what I grew up listening to, my mom loved Juvenile and Big Tymers. I think I just realized why I’m 30, single, with no kids 😂 plenty of practice though 😂😂😂
Is there a white music month?
Ummmm I like it like that😅....I'm gonna have to back that thing up!😂🎉
The Crowd passed the vibe check🥹🔥🔥🔥
“We be making hits yeah after hits yeah!”
My Junior/high school rap playlist done live in 2023!!! Man I teared up a few times I wont lie, this was SO GOOD.
Only group I know everyone went solo and still respect and coo with one another
4000000 deeegrreeezzzzzz💯💪🏾🔥
Man this was greatness, they were rocking
DeFund
Rodeo was my favorite ❤
I was NOT prepared for this !!!! A whole vibe . Out in Venice but listening to Juve like it was 98
❤
I would pay goooood money to see this live. So good
Best video on the whole of YouTube!!!! Juveeeeee
Next wizkid
This is not just a concert, its also a time machine that took me back to when I was a 20 year old young man. Life was so much different then. Well done Juve and Fresh. Truly a masterpiece. Let’s hope the youth of today puts respect on yalls name.
I wish I could like this 1,000 times
Juve Tha Great!!!
Most raw performance ever good job
Is that Nipsey on the keyboard 😮
🔥🔥🔥🔥
So we just gonna ignore Nipsey Hussel on keyboards?
This was truly amazing. I love me some Juvenile and Manny Fresh. The memories....✌🏽🧡🙏🏾🌷😊
Manny and Juvenille! 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩 Go DJ!!!!!!
This is amazing!!!!
Let me tell you man 400 degrees one of the greatest albums ever 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
21:38 the trombone jazz riff is insane.  WOOO
If only he played... IM CHARGIN 600 for some big O's...  wouldve made this perfect
I was saving this to watch. So good and everything I expected. ❤️
🕺 they were jammin'
He had so many more hits he could have done. We need a part 2🎉
My my my. That boy still good
When you got Juvie & Mannie Fresh together, you already know it’s going to be 🔥🔥🔥!!!  Awesome concert!!!
3rd time watching this 💙🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾
Dam this took me back to some good  times
Mannnnnnn they do not make ‘em like this anymore!!!!! Juvenile is as good here as he was 20 years ago. A legend. Real music. A true artist  🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥
So good!!! Could not stop smiling or dancing. Juvie’s Tiny Desk will be tough to beat!
Hip hop runs the world
This Is Hands Down The Best Tiny desk I’ve Seen
Why? I don’t see what the big deal is. Black people get excited over insignificant things. And yes, I am black.  Singing in a small space, ok. Next.
This is the unplug 👍 🔥
Man when this dropped….. Take me back! Not many rappers sound good live…. Juvenile is a legend!
Only thing that could make this iller is if Mannie Fresh shirt says "Bad motherfkr in Begets" in Chinese.     If you know you know. Suuuunnnshiiinnnnee.
Love you Manny Fresh!!
Please tell me this is turning into an album.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
Maneeeeee dawg this monumental 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wow 🔥🔥🔥 even the intro was goosebumps 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
I've repeated the first song an unhealthy amount of times.
I’ve been back here too many times. 💜🥳🙌🏾
Man I love yall! This the truth!!!
Tiny Desk ain't playing
This is the absolute best thing I’ve seen in a long time!!! Kids today don’t even know!
I couldn't sit for 28 mins straight I had to get up and daaaaance
21:38 that Trombone player is the TRUTH.  The Melodica player next to him was loving that line.
This was exactly what I needed right now. So good. Awesome to see Juv and Manny doing good and soundin good! NPR never misses with these.
I’m glad juvie never changed og fr
I’m back! It was a time to be alive!! ❤
❤
Best one yet
This is by far the best Tiny Desk ever done.
400 degreez is one of my favorite albums of all time
Juvi snd BIG FRESH🗣️🔥💨 this was fire man gotta love the creative culture
Absolute killer! 10/10 best ever and who knows if it will be matched
BLACK PEOPLE ARE PURE OPULENCE
The excitement I saw online in anticipation of this was like nothing I have seen before… Black people, white people, as long as you were a millennial you were stoked for this! 😅 What an amazing performance.
rodeo is the best juvenile song in my opinion
Genuine happiness watching this the whole time with the biggest smile on my face 😊
legend
I can not believe that was Mannie fresh saying hotboys in the background on the song this whole time. WOW
Incredible
Turk was my favorite hot boy.
"Took that di@k!" 😜
The ghetto satisfaction i needed... and the musicians are excellent! ❤❤❤ Black people we are the culture...
Juvie wouldn't have had to tell me twice to get athletic. You would've saw me twerking off a bookshelf 😂
90s to the 2000s best music ever!!🔥🔥
This tiny desk top 3 I think
Im a start jamming to my boys catalog now miss these days
They did that ❤❤❤
This is my favorite thing I’ve seen this entire year
Can we put some respect on Mannie Fresh name. He was that life force of Cash Money. And that’s no knock on everyone on the label but I don’t think people understand how much influence he has on every hit they ever pushed out.
Epic would be a colossal understatement. This is the pinnacle of Tiny Desk.
This was amazing! ❤ Took me back to middle school. Can't believe the words I'm repeating at 35, let alone 6th grade. 😂
The showmen ship is top notch💐😮‍💨🤌🏾
Unplugged album ???
Juvenile and Mannie Fresh, did a awesome job on your Tiny Desk performance.I was dancing the whole entire time❤🔥❤🔥I wish I could have been there…❤😊😍
Truly excellent performance!! I wish I was there too. It seemed like a straight party
Do you know when you’re stressed clenching your jaw and realize you should probably unclench to relax. I had the same involuntary muscle ticks but with a stank face with every song
👌
Southern Rap Legend 🤴🏾🔥🔥🔥
Bodied this.......legendary
Took me back to being a kid when life was simple and responsibilities were few.. this was a breath of fresh air.. thank you for this…
Whats he sippin on?
Best tiny desk
Amazing!!!! Ratchet and prof, great combo! Took me way back. Hahah tour pleeeeeasse
LOVE THIS ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Solja Rags
Mannie fresh is underrated!!!!
Thank you Juvie and Many for blessing us with your gifts!
❤❤WHAT NPR KNOW BOUT DIS !!!!  ❤❤❤
Just got a chance to watch this. Juvenile’s still got it! 💯💯
A tiny desk we needed a long time ago
Thank you @juvenile and the amazing band. This performance is a musical BBQ for your ears. Delicious!
Best one , Yet!!!
We ain't neva had no encore?!?! Mannie Fresh turned that mic around and I felt like i was there!! 🤯💜🤯
This brought me pure, genuine joy.
The set for slow motion sounds so good live!!!!
this man been a beast glad he getting his flowers
Incredible!
This is the ba ba ba ba best
Came here just to hear “slow motion” didn’t realize all of these songs were by Juvie.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Hahaha bro mannie fresh doin it
The instrumental of the first song is giving me James Bond vibes
I love the attire of the band.  The cohesiveness and the talent is wonderful.
Pure nostalgia!!! ❤
I didn't realize how much I would enjoy such vulgarity over a jazz tune. Juvy created a new genre that I didn't know I needed
And just like that, I’m going to be alright 😁🗣️🎧🎼🥁🎼🎺🎤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Whew! Juve been a beast. Love Mannie being there. Sincerity vs money grab.
This was beautiful 👏🏽👏🏽
TINY DESK NEVER DISAPPOINTS. Juvie was 🔥
This tha 1 rite chea’ 🔥🔥🔥
It’s the best bite of 400 degrees I ever heard in my life. ❤
This is simply amazing and DOPE. Thanks Tiny Desk
Once I saw the violins coming... I knew what time it was!!
The fact that mammie still cool with all of them is lit!!!
True art
NOW THAT WAS AWESOME ENDING❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
💯💯💯💯💯
Brought back memories! Best one so far!
Good Lord this is good
Juvie is giving me LIFE🔥🔥🔥
🤘🏾🔥🙏🏾🤘🏾
John Batista Wow .....I'm done
Omg the singers fav part
This is 🔥🔥
Omg to be there
Phenomenal!
Best Tiny Desk ever.
Its crazy, all them sound effects in them tracks were Manny Fresh being a magician in the studio! That intro was str8 fire!!
Best tiny desk hands down!!!!
Best yet. Also the only one I saw but that’s besides the point
JAZZ and BLUES are the path to liberation, I can't believe it's taking Tiny Desk to realize this, but I'm definitely here for it! Keep up the great work, perhaps the youth will find the power of ancestral knowledge,  and the sacred message is has preserved since the beginning of time! ❤☮️
These young men started tombout bling bling and ended up on the tube with iwatches on  keep pushing and stay in school
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is pure perfection!   Took me back to high school and college, while keeping it professional.   Juuuuuuvieee!!!
Twitter made this happen and I’m happy for it.
The Best Tiny Desk Ever 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The fact that this song is old and it still gravitates attention.
🔥🔥‼‼
All the hot boys need to get together for a reunion..this was sooo good.
Such a strong start!!!!!
This was 🔥🔥. I smiled the whole time 😂❤
I played tf outta his music 💯
So good!!!
A majority of us here are for the 16:00 mark.

This is one of the best rhings ive ever heard. Simply impressive and amazing
Cash Money

Thank you Tiny Desk for allowing the music to be free and uncensored!!!!❤❤❤❤
Glasses Malone on the trumpet, Rooga on the drums.

2023 and onwards need to take notes
OG's Rappin .. the Best is Fire 🔥🔥

Greatest tiny desk performance of all time
Why am I ready to apply for a job doing ANYTHING so that I can attend these concerts?
It’s been two weeks and this Tiny Desk is one of the most addictive if not THE most addictive.
The tiny desk we needed but never knew
This is an amazing performance, I never realized how much of my youth was saturated in cash moneys music but here I am almost 40 and rapping along. Great memories being a kid in atlanta around 2001. Maybe one day we can get a performance with Ludacris.
I thought Usher was gone be my Tiny Desk but this another level lol💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
Make me respect mannie fresh production even more
This is the best tiny desk yet!! We need more of this!!!
Dude behind Julie with the guitar can’t stop laughing
Best Tiny desk ever recorded. I’ve watched twice start to finish
The best one yet onGod!!!
My Aunty Mannie Fresh😂😂😂😂😂   just playing They did that
This was lit ❤ back down memory lane❤️
This is 🔥🔥🔥
This made me smile. After 25 years and the same effort and energy.
How can I support this? Is it ok Ian from Canada? These tunes are amazing. Can I buy the tunes to download? 109% support
The juxtaposition. Might be my favorite tiny desk ever

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 AMAZING!!!!
Energy was amazing 🤩 Juvie the Great 🎉
The emotions are high reminiscing on better times with these classics… OUTKAST next please
How does Rodeo sound so rich?  I’m listening with headphones and if I didn’t see where they are I would think this was done in a studio with all sorts of filters or whatever they do on those boards with all the lights and dials.  The ladies’ voices are so gorgeous.
Amazing , just too much talent,  From allthe musicians 👍🤡❤🔥💯
196k likes just don't feel like enough

Don’t forget this man said “VAX that thang up”

1994 year I was born growing up to music like this was epic. The good times.
chilldhood music , 9 yeqrs old 99
This is classic Tedris.. needed this classic retake into the past of real rap ❤
The absolute best!!
I would’ve caught a flight for this one. I need a ticket.
Thee best Tiny Desk to date! I danced and sang my heart out! Well done!!🩷🩷🩷🤦🏾‍♀️
When I say I’m educated ratchet, this is what I mean😂
Why i started crying!! Im so happy to see Juvenile and mannie fresh together and the orchestra band did an awesome job . I love us!
I love me some Juvenile! 💯🔥🔥cant stop smiling . The band fye!
20:08 - why you’re here  (the violinist was holding herself together 😂)
Bass player's joy part of the greatness!
Third comment: Trombone Shorty was the surprise l needed. Love him!!!! ❤❤❤❤
This concert makes me so happy I feel like Jerome in the house😂💃🏽
The best EVER!! They did that 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾I love me some Juvenile…. Manny fresh is a genius, I’m sure he put that together. Shout out to the band, singers and special guest . This did not disappoint ❤
The Amours remind me of Changing Faces!
I can’t explain it but this made everything better 😭😹
Belie dat woadie
Best thing I've heard in awhile. Makes me wanna have a juvenile day
The instruments , the ability to hear his voice,  this was great so refreshing !
Second comment: This is epic. Love this...
Mr.Juvie enduring l definitely rejuvenated us 🌻
Flashback 💯💯
Randomly jon batiste 🤣 this is goated
the look of satisfaction of the violinist's face when plucking those initial chords. She probably played it in grade school jokingly and never imagined playing that song live with Juvy himself. Surreal, probably my 5th time watching this  Edit: I've watched this like 50 times now
This was the best Tiny Desk performance thus far. Love my dude Juve and Mannie Fresh even tho he is slowing phasing into that 57 y.o. Lesbian Aunt who's been coming to the cookout for the last 20 years with her "roommate". 👀  God Bless Keep em coming Tiny Desk stick to the realest. 💪🏾👏🏽🔥
Listen. Babyyyyyy. ❤❤
God bless 🙏 juvenile and fresh my favorites of the group.
🍾⛽️🗣
No lie I wish I can like this a million times!!! I enjoyed this soooooo much
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽  we waiting on you Juvi and Mannie Fresh
Take this on the road!
Facebook brought me here. I never knew about this production and it's amazing! I'm going to watch almost every performance tonight!
I no this heat🔥🔥
3.6 million views in 13 days and counting
Manny Fresh is a GOAT best tiny desk yet!
Juvy kinda nice lol.... enjoying the old jams fellas, sounding great
Jon Batiste is all of us barely able to contain his excitement
Absolute classic!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I feel nosey
WOW!!!!
The lyrics are so degenerate, but the arrangement is pure gold. A sort of ghetto orchestra if you will.
This was THE BEST tiny desk concert to date. Hands down 504 represent
Juvie has the best Tiny Desk, no discussion needed.
I love Manny's smile.  They both enjoyed this.  Thanks TD❤
I love this so much
Mannie fresh will go down in history as one of the most underrated and under hyped of all time. A true gem, and this was a master class in art in every aspect of the word. Salute Big Tymers and the magnolia soldiers 🫡
Listen I can’t stop watching this . I was already a Juvie fan but this right here was the best ever. The band everyone did so good !   “Can a playa from the nola get a chance with it” 🤗🤗
What in the work release program is going on here...lol I love it
I’m so confused right now. Do I keep my tie on or can I get ratchet? 😂😂 This is awesome
JUV 💚🖤🤎
Feel like I was at the Hammerstein ballroom at a live show! Slow motion came on while I was in the shower and now the bathroom is flooded 😅. This was great ❤
💭 This was everything!!...  (It's JUVE!) 😎🎵💃🏽👍🏽
I’m telling my kids this is James Brown.
R.I.P. Soulja Slim🕊🕊🕊
This was immaculate!
Go head Juvi! Lol
Wow! 20:04 mins.  Outstanding live performance ever!
Love this...
Top 10 best TDC videos ever💯🔥. And MOST unexpected too
I would of been so ratchet in the most humble way in there ❤
Hott
🔥🔥🔥
Mannie Fresh looks like a lesbian auntie
What a great show, such a special performance! I would've paid Taylor Swift and Beyonce money to attend this. Juvie killed it, the band killed it and the live production from Mannie was crazy👏👏👏👏
Shouldn’t have decided to listen to this at work.😂😂 I want to cut up so bad.
Bring him back for Ghetto Children
Ayyyyyyyyyeeeeee!! Let's Gooooo Juvie
JUVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
21:40 😊
Best Tiny desk thus far! 💥
This would've been dope without the vocals...
Truly appreciative of Juve, his catalogue is impressive, and is great to hear live in this setting.
My 3 year old son enjoyed this with me 😂😂😂😂...this was golden ❤
The one time Birdman didn’t make an appearance 😂😂😂
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
We need time stamps!!!
Legends of that times....
probably one of the best Tiny Desks I seen.  shoutout all the southern rappers againg like wine.
I just rewinded this😁😁
Somebody at tiny desk knows real music ❤ Not that they dont always
This is definitely a must watch🔥🔥🔥 Can’t just watch one time…  I couldn’t stop moving
💨💨💨💨💨💨💨💨💨💨💨💨💨💨💨💨💨💨💨
The REALIST Tiny Desk EVER!! 😄😄😄😄😄👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👉🏾
This is so fresh and live… loving every minute of this performance 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Juve got more hits than a boxing gym! Love these jazzy renditions!
Man idk how to feel about this one lol I was happy for juvenile then I felt rachet then I feel like I was 14 again then I felt like I wanted to call this let chick from back in the day that gave me a rodeo on the song rodeo man let me log off good stuff juve….
Bro brought a team to tiny desk…
Wayne my favorite then but as I've aged Juvy was the best lyricist
Ima find me some new nookie and buy her a 4 runner! Forever the classic bar lol
Legend says he still holding that can
Literally THE best Tiny Desk concert that y'all have ever done. We need to start opening it to the public!!!!
I have watched this an unhealthy amount of times
400 degree eyes mercury  green I see that face demon in warrior King  vedio Thank You  Bubble cousins
GOAT
This shht🔥🔥🔥🔥 could watch this all day all the songs in the whole cashmoney catalog before 2012💯
I’ve probably watched this 20 times at this point. Tiny Desk is gonna have a hard time topping this one.
I've watched this about 35 times and I don't think I like it. I think I  will watch another 35 times to see if it grows on me.
What a fun show! Juve crushed it!
This is so long overdue. Mannie Fresh and Juvie are GOATs!
I loved everything about this Tiny Desk with Juvenile!! I don’t see nobody else cutting up like this! Perfect, original and authentic performance.
So Mannie Fresh next?
This was the best!  Thank you Tiny Desk!
This gave me life. Tiny desk you out did yourselves ❤️
I bet they didn’t even know the response they was going to get off of this one 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
N.O. rappers have always been my favorites and Juvie is my favorite among them. He and Manny Fresh have made so many classics together. New Orleans rappers are so unique though. They're so much more musical and organic because of the musical and cultural influences of New Orleans. You can really hear the second line and live music influences, especially in this. New Orleans is the soul of American culture.
Man this was soooo dope ❤needed this today
What’s so funny is a lot of white people know every song on this mug and was singing and spitting right along with Juve!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wow
Grown man music LFG
This was absolutely incredible
NPR did this? Well then...
Raise your hand if you’ve watched at least twice 🙋🏾‍♀️
20:05 greatest love song 4real real 🎉 ...
Juvenile and Manny Fresh!!! Absolutely LOVE to see this!! Brings back so many great memories ❤❤❤
Juvie know good and darn well I'm here for  ALL OF IT, but mainly starting @ 20:05.... ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥
This is like my 3rd time watching this 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Npr always come thru but juvie look happy need getem backout muzik nodayz trash runit❤
They could take this set on tour and sell out night after night.
❤
I wish it wasn’t the clean version one some of these lyrics
I’m not ashamed at how many times I watched this 🥹
I almost forget Juvie was top tier with lyrics.
Ayyyy tiny desk crew is top notch. Tiny desk needs to take it on the road. Production team- you guys are the real mvps   Juvi still got it🎉
Mannie>>>>Baby
Y’all should get lil Wayne
Best tiny desk I’ve seen! Go juvenile and manny frizzle!
The best Tiny Desk EVER!!!!!
3 MILLION VIEWS IN 13 DAYS..  🤳🤳 I'M JUST SAYING.....

This was absolutely beautiful 💝🙌🏾🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
A Hot Boys tour would be dope af
There's a certain generation of guys blowing up the comments who grew up listening to this music and all I can do is smile when I see how much nostalgia it brings to them😂
This is hilarious 😂  but also very well put together
This was so fire!!!!!!!
Theee best!! Still not over this🫶
Well, this was fantastic
🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
He did that!
Juv been threw along he stopped rapping for some years after is long time wife an daughter's  were killed by his step son. Sad glad he's in good spirits  now
Pure gold!
I love juvenile always
❤🖤🖤
Legendary
Waiting for u on drink champs, need that! Also, could have used the "down bottom" verse!!
This was way too 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥
This is my all time favorite....and it ain't just cause I'm from the Nolia!
Pure genius!!!😊
How much I gotta pay!? Perfection
How do Mac Miller get over 100 millions views. I don't know 1 song. Juve only 2 million and usher at 17 million. Don't make sense to me 7:31
🔥🔥🔥
I love this!!!
I never knew so many lyrics to a tiny desk concert!
Best TD ever!!! 🔥🔥🔥
400 degrees was an album full of singles. No skips. One of the greatest rap albums of all time. True masterpiece
Man, wow. Some next level performance. Love it!
Simply amazing 🔥🔥🔥🔥
GET JAMIE FOXX❤
I can get use to this fire, more please!
Juve looking like that cool uncle at the cookout that sneaks you a wine cooler or drink when your mom ain't looking. All jokes aside, Hats off to NPR team for introducing the world to such a diverse array of music and cultures through the tiny desk!!!
loved it!!  💖
These tiny desks are where its at FRFR!!  Imagine being lucky enough to be what seems like very few that get to sit in on em!! Where do i sign up? Lol fr
Mannie Fresh is a musical genius. Glad his greatness is on display.

This episode deserves an award.
Best intro of all time

I Come back & listen to Rodeo every week….. did that
❤❤ don't play with him that's my baby daddy Put Some Respect On His Name TERIUS GRAY
You see music influences not just one group of people but everyone. God created us to love one another no matter skin tone or what neighborhood you grew up in. I love this right her. God uses music as a tool to bring everyone together. 🙏🏾 blessings to you all
🔥🔥🔥

Juvie was that ni$$@. This was hard with the live band. Juvie always had that voice.
So many hits!!! He deserves this moment 🎉👏🏾
Just here for my daily viewing.
The energy that juve and mannie brought was incredible! Some tiny desk concerts the artist is awkward and tiny desk is too far out of their comfort zone, not juve and mannie. They controlled that performance from beginning to end. The audience could feel the energy and it was a party in the office.
Horn section rockin thooooo, I see y’all 😂❤
All the hbcus play his stuff legendddddd
Super dope
Juve top tier Entertainment. This man is the best, and Respect talent and brings them and they know he something special and they come with him... Legend Juve, this this Your flowers and then some Brother.
Is it me, or Manny fresh don't have any eyebrows 🤔
This made me a subscriber. Best one yet!
I just had to comment. Absolutely amazing!
Brilliant!
This is 🔥, this my middle school/high school years right here. Love them both, and NOLA music. Mannie Fresh do look like somebody auntie these days tho. 🤣
I love how much fun every person in that room is having. This made my night 😊
The way this comment section is unified in celebrating Juve gives me so much joy! This was absolutely incredible. Just A1. Tiny desk you have out done yourselves. Bravo!
Yessss Many Freshhhh still that Yeahhh yeahhhh
Loooove this!
Juvey Need to do a comeback ❤

This is music history being made. God bless Juvenile!

crowd was too calm for me, i’d have been goin AWF!  woulda got put out 😂
THAT WAS DOPE
They still the Hot Boys
Amazing this was so fun to watch
Boosie and Webbie next!!!!
W T flying fuh am I watching?! Juvenile has fallen into a rabbit hole and has gone into the world of Alice in Wonderland.  This is the weirdest sh*t i have seen and heard in my life.  I am left cringing.
Juvie, Minnie, The Band, and Background Singers did they thang. This is my favorite Tiny Desk Concert....hands down.
This is hip hop grown up. Bring the show on the road
🚨LATE MILENNIALS 🚨 get your tiger balm and LET'S GO! Juvie.. Mannie.. Jon Batiste.. the band... trombone shorty.  miss with the violin. This was top tier!
ENCORE ENCORE!! GIVE THE PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT!!!
Eloquent rachetness. I love my 90s. We fancy now!
Slow motion😩😩😩😩😩💕💕💕💕
All that money cash money made and these guys didn't get what hey deserve
Do a tour of this show, please, Juve!!! 🎉🎉🎉
I swear Wayne needs to do tiny desk next after hearing juve …:and what’s the beef with Turk n juve they need to fix that asap
I can not believe how much i love this, such a vibe❤❤❤!
that was pretty good.
Take it on the road …and I’ll see ya there ❤
How are we supposed to take this music seriously as culture when it's this misogynistic? Nice instrumentals. Bummer it got so gross so quickly. I never thought I'd be this guy: our taxes got spent on this?
We use to get crunk to cash money and no limit and wild out in the club now as a 37 year old man married with kids a little older now this how I want my cash money concerts to look like I can’t be doing all that partying no more I got to go to bed 😂😂😂
Mike Jones needs one now
I’ve watched this way too many times 😂
Perfect
Such a great jam !
Mannie fresh voice is legendary
😂😂😂 Let mi comment b4 they delete this episode 😂😂😂 You know how somebody about call dem boi
All I can say is this was  🔥🔥🔥‼️‼️

Juvenile always been one of my favorite rappers
Rodeo was too good!
❤❤

They aint aint have the right mix of people there smh  that crowd was not from the 99 lol
I love it 💓
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
THIS IS ABSOLUTE JOY IN THE HARDEST WAY POSSIBLE
Out of all of the Tiny Desks concerts I’ve seen over the years, and out of all of the artists and performers THIS IS MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE TINY DESK CONCERT!!!
FRESH TURN TINY DESK INTO A BLOCK PARTY🎉❤
Goat 🐐
On so many levels, this is great! Mannie’s energy and skills, Juvenile’s crystal clear lyrics, and the band/instrumentation is supreme. Go on the road Juvenile!!!!

Is it just me or was the crowd not ready!?
Look at that artistry. Best thing ever!
I wish I could like this a million times!!!!!
👏🏽 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Gotta love hearing Juvie & Manny Fresh again
Manny was so fine to me him, wayne, and juvie ❤️

I love the bass player trying to be cool even though he was feeling at times. Also the sax player had mad energy! Perfect!
We need a Project Pat Tiny desk now!
Room probably smell like Louisiana
🎻😂🔥🙏 this was amazing 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
After we perish, let aliens find this. It's just the highest we can get.
Juvie need to do a small venue concert just like this! Best Tiny desk to date!
❤🔥❤🔥❤🔥❤🔥❤🔥
I was able to act right up until 13:27....then I couldn't help it😜😜🤦🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️

This brought back so many memories... love it
OK, just...AMAZING.  This made me so happy!
I love the Tiny Desk performances!
I enjoyed every moment of this!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥 🔥 🔥
Thank you Juvie!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Legend.
The amount of times I watched this. It's so good. And Mannie still fresh! Ha!😂
Wayne not showing up for his part in back that zzz up is an absolute tragedy…
When he said it's about to get real athletic up in here he meant that! Honey I'm In the kitchen pacing back and forth out of breath after dancing to back that ahh up 😂😂 CLASSIC!!!
Birdman and cam swear they too good for what made um
TIMELESS MUSIC💯💯💯💯💯🐐
Legends🐐 I didn’t know how much I needed this this morning over here lit smiling from ear to ear!  MANE WHAT A TIME TO BE ALIVE!! Thank You Kings💯❤
That’s genuine love, not on no pop icon bs, just vibing through his catalog with fans
They should’ve live streamed this! Would’ve had the whole world vibing all at one time 🎶
i love the dichotomy of the standard lyrical base of hip-hop nestled into the corner of that office that usually houses such lefty-brained folks. I also love how many people love this. good job.
This is what I needed in my life today.
I need this live! Come on Juve, do the Tiny Desk Tour
This was the best Tiny Desk of all time
Bro that crowd couldn’t really appreciate this!! I’m going word for word every single hit, old, new. Love Manny hitting his own adlibs and vocal effects.
“Ha” always will be a classic with his off beat spitting 😂
Mannie Fresh a genius! Was cooking straight 🔥🔥 back then with limited tools compared to today.
Talk about, If you stay ready, . . . They both didn't miss a step!! 😮
Being from Nola, I forget how many national hits Juvie had. He has all these concerts locally in small venues all the time here.
My favorite tiny desk I watch this over and  over definitely my time and era  doing it for tha 99❤❤
Man they smoked this . Well done!!
This was the best TinyDesk, right there next to DuaLipas 😂
I’ve always been a fan of Juvi!! Love this man!
How did I miss this from 11 days ago.  I still rock 400 Degrees the cd
Listening to this while looking for a job need to motivation
Speechless!
From the intro
This brings back some good memories.
Please get *Bones Thugs N Harmony* as a guest.
Juvenile saved rap for me. In the late 90s, No Limit Records ruled the radio with their mostly lazy, by-the-numbers raps. Then Juvenile and Cash Money came in with a fresh sound and great bars. It was exactly what the genre needed to stay relevant. At least, that's my POV.
Juve
🔥
I have watched this several times and each time I smile harder and harder. This is nostalgia at it's finest. Luv ya Juvie and thank you Mannie❣️
Thit sh*t banggin....
Mannie MF Fresh!!!!
Yessssss i loveddddd this❤❤
Usher and Juvee are both top tier and my favorite performances
This just proves we need a hot boy reunion
That dude in the green was living in a dream. You can tell he's a fan
GO RUN THEM CASH MONEY VIEWS UP
This was so poetic to me 😊. Joy!
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾🤞🏾🤞🏾🤞🏾
I bet I'll get them boys off yo block.....
Mannie Fresh is sooooooo UNDERATED. Its his talent, energy and vibe. You can't google download that style
When i say they came CORRECT!!!!!!!
I'm here for this!
Delivery and breath control A1 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
Bringing that 400 degreez flava, ha?
Who ever was responsible for getting Juvie  need a raise.  This  was epic
Never thiught id be crying at footage of a juvenile concert in 2023...
They killed this !!!

By far the best Tiny Desk concert !!
Npr gets down , never saw it coming.  How npr knew my favorite poet?
Big Up to Juve!
Am I missing something? This dude sounds like a homeless guy in front of a band. Also the lyrics are that of a 5th grader.
This is the best 30 minutes in the month of July 2023
I'm glad I wasn't the only one drinking hennessy
My ticket came today, I can't wait!!! And it's going to be my 61st birthday...St. Louis is waiting 😜😜
Literally best Tiny desk!
This is what Youtube should be, just to share the beauty, and this is gold.
Juvenile the southern Guru 🔥🔥🔥 they have a similar tone to me This was epic bling bling
I love Mannie Fresh hahahaha
Dude on the piano looks like Nipsey Lamar (Nipsey Hussle x Kendrick Lamar) lol you know bruh is from LA fasho haha
This is literally how they do those residency in Vegas. When Usher leave, Juvie and Mannie Fresh at the MGM Grand. Lol.
They Really Did A GREAT JOB… Cuz I Really Dont Like Live Concerts
Please give whoever is responsible for this at Tiny Desk a raise… it’s well deserved.
ONE OF MY FAV ARTISTS & ONE OF MY FAV PRODUCERS!!! 💚💚 He killed it!!!!!! Then he played the National Anthem twice!?!?!!!! I jammed way too hard!!! This was a an amazing time! Thank you!
Juvie & Mannie Fresh deserves their flowers! 💐💜 Period.
16:16 when people ask me what my type is
Legend.
So next time they mention Pac, Biggie, and Jay Z… Don’t forget Juvie baby..
🙏
All time tiny desk finished!!
I ❤these TDC..
Can’t do nothing but smile
I remember in High School when Juvie’s first album 400 introduced us all to Cash Money. I liked “Ha” but didn’t like the way hip hop was going. Funny cause after a few years I became a fan and he’s still my favorite from that label. Slow Motion became an anthem that brings me back to summer 2004 anytime I hear it. This tiny desk is brilliant.
Yeah people be sleeping on juvenile even Lil Wayne looked up to him and said he had go harder when he was on the song when they was the hotboys Because juve was no joke.I'd say him and Lil Wayne was neck n neck then f.r. but now Lil Wayne a little bit more boyyy shhoottttt.. he definitely done mastered his craft he the Michael Jackson of rap💯💯
I use to get on all that girls 🍑🍑🐱 when Rodeo use to be played in the college parties.
Dang this took me back my HS years 99/2003✊🏾💪🏾
I wished I saw the crowd during this lol 😂🔥🔥🔥🔥   I spoke too soon 😂😂😂
For my 99-2000 boo thangs on they lunch break or need some stress release...the strings start @20:02. But...WATCH THE WHOLE THANG WHEN YOU GET OFF WORK. It's sooooo worth it. K,Bye.
I’m a dye heart Juvenile fan!!!
Was I the only person shocked to see to see Mannie Fresh?
Wow! That was hard!
Hands down one of the best performances ever!!!!! I would pay to see him do this again❤️
I LOVE HIM ❤
Juvenile and Mannie Fresh along with everyone else did their thing. Great Performance! 🥰
Fantastic
We definitely need a “Mystikal” Tiny Desk Next!
Flashed back to some interesting times on this one.
I love how they intentionally didn't show any NPR employees backin it up.
This was lit!!😂🤣😂🎉🎉🎉
This was straight fire, one of the best tiny desk concerts.
I grew up on Juvi. This was soo 🔥🥺
That’s Cuba Gooding Jr.
IF WE HAD A DMX TINY DESK
Juvenile the greatwith manning fresh sounds good in 2023
Took me right back to high school days. 🙌🏾 This was everything! Juvie and Mannie do it the best!

This was the soundtrack of my college shenanigans now repackaged for my middle age knee abilities. Such a blessing! 😂❤
Hearing that intro with the live instruments. 💯✊🏾
I would love to see Juvenile on verzuz against any artist from his days
Too fire 🔥
this seemed like one of the most live npr tdc’s ever. that crowd was so live too and the encore 🎇🎇❤️🧨🧨
Epic 😂😂😂😂😂😂 Love you Juve

They didn't know what to do with Uncle Juvie!! 😂🫶🏾✊🏾 S/O to the lady that said "ONE MORE TIME!" 🤝🏾💯

Maybe I’m biased because of my age, or being from Louisiana…but this is the greatest tiny desk ever. It will never be topped. And I would 100% love if they did a tour of this. Small venues, live band, just juvenile and manny. Just sooo 🔥🔥🔥

3million views is crazy
I’m from the south, class of 2001. This made my year!!!
Somebody better give my dude Mannie Fresh the love he deserves. Juvenile was legit, but Mannie Fresh made a lot of those songs!
I bet that guy on the Cello never in his life expected to play for Juvenile. 😂
Juve was the tiny desk that we needed. One of the best ones
Loved every minute but this version of Slow Motion 🔥
Top 3 Tiny Desk.
Well done mannie fresh and juvie loved it best performance to date

It's still on repeat
Slow Motion really got me 🫠

I don't give a f ...juvenile on the Same level as Wayne.....juvenile a f',in legend
Str8 fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I never thought he was fine but lawddd something about this man in this video is doing things to me 🥰😅
Why could i see Mike Epps doing a parody lol
Yeah we know dat part 💃🏽
NPR is communist trash, but this concert was 🔥!!
Juve and manny did their thing. Shout out to the band.
That was so much FUN!
Whew that man playing the guitar is so FINE!
I ALWAYS thought Juvenile was the star of that whole click..  He is STILL my star. This was just FUN to watch.  Reminds me of fish frys in the projects waaaayyyy back in the day.
Mannie Fresh looks so embarrassed signing along to these lyrics😂we all grow up eventually
Juve and his energy brought me back.
Remy ma shether @ Nikki. It was 🔥🔥🔥 and Nas Ether @ Jay-Z 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Juve the great
My guilty pleasure 🫣🤦‍♀️
FIRE FIRE 🔥 🔥 !!!
This was sooooo🔥Omg
Does anyone know where that clip of the remix sound Mannie played before I need a hot girl comes from? That was CRAZY.
The Legend Juvi
This was a great performance. Juvi did his thang.
2 TIMES
Love it!!!!!😘👌😊😁
Alvin Ford on them drums!!!!
Rap. Set America back about 250 years. Now its just a country of punks with sewer mouths.
This is a whole vibe and taking us down memory lane!...It is well deserved!!! 👏🏿👏🏿
Juve 🔥
This went WAY harder than I expected. The arrangement is incredible.
Man i wish wayne would've showed up just for that project b part
Literally impossible not to have fun watching this
This is my 3rd time watching this one… best one ever!!!
What I love best is they showed (who didn’t know already) that they are musicians (people who play instruments 😐).
AW Manny Fresh Too❤❤❤❤
😠 'promosm'
Keyboard player looks like Anthony Mackie & Nipsey Hussle mixed lol 🎹
Unexpected. But fire af
Using a vocoder as a back up vocal with rapping is sick. Idk why no one has ever really done that. Its so cool sounding.
Tour please!! Thank you in advance.😊
This got me smiling so hard I love this 🎉🎉🎉🎉 FOR THE CULTURE FOR SURE!!!!
This is sooooo good … and I didn’t realize I was going to know every song. This video made my day.
In My Opinion Juvenile Was The Best Artist In CMB Hands Down!
Need one for Pusha T
Bling Bling was one of the songs that got me hooked on hip hop. That brought back some serious core memories wow.
🔥🔥🔥
LAWD THAT JUVIE! THAT NOYA THAT NOLA -YO!👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾

In tears because it’s home. Not just the south, but New Orleans, Baby!  We are always this live, this lit, this loved. To hear the audience participate in this is how we are behind our artists. The contribution of not just the south…. New Orleans….WE BELONG. To see this well deserved recognition. World-wide, world-renowned….Thank you Juvenile, Mannie Fresh, Ca$h Money, Hot Boyz for your contribution to music! Watching on my 41st birthday for the first time!!! ❤❤❤❤

Not a fan of this clown. But its still better than anything coming out today. 😂😂
Anybody else have a slight feeling they’re lip syncing some songs? I hope not because this is fire…
I’m finna install subs in the E36 just so I can knock these boys sounds down the road 🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊

The violinist went hard tho❤
The best tiny desk ever!!!!
I didn't know before I watched it but I needed  that!!!
🔥🔥🔥
That audience wasn't hyping it up at all
I was just saying to myself the other day, "What happened to Juvy?"  He never made the transition to content streaming, good to see him back in action.
I came up on all this right here. All the way to Virginia.  Respect
🔥
Man so much in this performance after long minute haven’t been dipping  hiphop into my ear. 🔥❤️ Definitely worthy to champion after Amercian Jazz, blues, and soul music back in the days
Loved every minute of this!!! Thought I was an undergrad again! 😂😊😂
Such nostalgia!! ☺️
Yess❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Thank you so much for this!
When da rap game was da realist new orleans baby
This is just absolutely great
Love Juvie!!!! He did that! One of my fav Tiny Desk performances!
This has to be the most fun I've seen people have on Tiny Desk. Artists and audience alike!  Big Ups to the band as well!
Awesome to see Juvie, Mannie, and the crowd just having FUN!!! 🔥
Aww man. Look at my peoples. I like seeing artist I grew up on showing grey but staying healthy and active. Much love.
My 10th time watching. This might be better than Usher to me
Manny should have hit that "Cash Money Records taken over for the 99s and the 2000s"
NOLA #1
Now the older folks can't talk about the current rappers with lyrics like these from the nine nine and the thiiiiiigjsand
New Orleans at its finest!
Juvenile. Excellent! Mr. Chief Keef@bigguccisosa next 😅❤
Vax that thang up
I have listened to this like 20 times. They need to do a hot boys tour with everybody when bg gets out of jail. Use a live band, it adds so much to the music. Mannie and juve sounded incredible. Most concerts today is just a sing a long and it is nice to hear raw talent. I wish DMX was still alive to do one of these.
What’s the bass players name and contact info? 😮‍💨
If they dropped dat now it be number lol again lol 😢
Birdman  somewhere low key smiling ! Cash Money Family love dem boys
That was🔥
Mannie is a big key to all of these guys songs to fire 🔥
Thank you Birdman Cashmoney for making music great again lol 😅
Juve and Mamie fresh need s add comedy show
Babyyyyyy❤❤❤❤
They understood the assignment. Periodt
Bling bling without weezy is hard to digest. No hate or disrespect at all, its just a lil off
Couldn’t stop smiling with pride when Ha dropped
I hope this Juvie version makes it to Bridgerton next season!!
I needed that back in my life he a g  like  Scarface to me 💯
Perfectly executed ❤ only missed my jam Bounce Back! Keep going yall🎉
Juvenile has always been trash but his sellout song "vax that Thang up" solidified his legacy on the wall of trash hall of fame. "Anythang for the money yea" 😂😂😂🚮🗑️
iconic. legendary. Cash Money forever!!!!!!!!!
Forgot how many bangers he had.
I'm from Monroe Louisiana bro thank y'all for real y'all boys represented us great this was yeah  yeah y'all my era thanks thanks thanks putting on a good show and holding Louisiana down
❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉 Hallelujah, Just what my soul needed!
Yesssssss thank you tiny desk!!! I loved this so much!
I'm 19 again haha
Sir on that keyboard, that’s my husband tell him ive been looking for him all my life.
This was a great 💡. 🔥
This is the peak of tiny desk concerts, everyone in there felt the vibes. Power of music.
Absolutely killed it.
This was everything!! Shout out to everybody on set/on stage & behind this concept. I love that juvie is drinking from a can with himself on it 😁. Some of the guy’s playing instruments facial expressions made me feel like they heard some of these lyrics for the 1st time! Especially hot girl & project chick lol. I overall enjoyed this & it went by to fast!  Cash money fan since elementary! Work out y’all issues make a movie & go on tourrrrr!!

NOSTALGIC PARADISE
This gotta be at least top 2 or 3 tiny desk performances. Very well executed.🔥🔥
i wish i was there😢
I’ve watched this a ridiculous number of times 😭
Was rocking the whole time 😂🔥🤟🏽
Juvey needs to take this show on the road. We’re getting older and this would be so fun go to see live in smaller club type venues. So cool.
Yooooo! Nice set! Thank you NPR Tiny Desk!
This video gotta be on pace for some kinda record for views. At least tiny desk views. 3.1 million views in 8 days is insane
From the intro...I just felt so happy watching this!
Mannn Mannie Fresh is a walking track just waiting to be released he's a bad boyyyy
This is  everything Hip hop and rap was meant to be!…Lyrically, musically and synergistically ICONIC!
If you win the lottery and tried to be classy but still have the streets in you had a video……
I almost broke my back and popped my knee outta of place 😂😂
Juvenile killed that. And Manny Fresh is the man. Love this!
The best tdc ever
Love this ❤
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 the best one
💐 💐 💐 💐 💐 💐 💐 💐💐 💐 💐 💐 💐 💐 💐 💐 💐 💐 💐 💐 💐 💐 💐 💐 someone give him these cus no one did
If youre a music lover Tiny desk is paradise on earth. This Juve set was 🔥. My dream would to see Kendrick Lamar and Jcole in this setting.....🙌🏾
Defund NPR
His voice is gold.
This Louisiana Girl, LOVED IT!
My life is complete!!!!
Who ever set this tiny desk up needs a raise and it was killer.
They killed this whole entire set.. Mannie still sounds good but he killed with those two beautiful ladies, Trombone Shorty, And then the cello and violinist.  The entire set was right.!!!!!
I think Manny Fresh is still trying to get some audio from that microphone.
From Hot Boyz, to Hot Men! 😊 I'm 37 now, but been rocking with cash money since "98!(My cousin was Soulja Slim, rip! 😢🙏🏽) This was well deserved, and I'm thankful for this! Thank you, Tiny Desk!!! 👏🏾 👏🏾 👏🏾 ❤❤❤ 🔥 O.G. Juvie! ❤❤💜
Q. How many times have you watched this?  A. Yes
❤❤❤Amazing
Anyway to buy a physical copy of this??
Imagine working at NPR 🥹
Juvie and Manny these views are running up!
N’Awlins Baby!! 🔥🙌🏽🫶🏽🥰
Mannie Fresh thank you!!! THANK YOU!! THANK YOU!! GOAT
This whole set is beyond amazing. Juve shows his brilliance with his intonations and rhythm-keeping abilities. This mashup between this rap and jazz-styled slow jam-like  approach is super easy to rush and get off beat. He did amazing. My whole face was stank throughout. My man and I had the ugg mugz the entire time ❤😂
Just gone head and give us a Part ll 🎉👏🏾🤞🏾♥️🥰💃🏽🎶🫶🏾
The Tiny Desk I had no idea I needed until I heard it! 🔥 🔥 🔥
The best most natural performance I’ve seen. Thank you Juvenile for taking us back into time with this. ❤️✅
Classic! I love this with the live band.
To think that this is funded by taxpayer money is astounding
🔥🔥🔥🔥
9:23😂😂😂😂😂
5 seconds in, heard the band, knew it needed 👍, he killed it

Classy ratchet 😅 🎉
400 degrees was a great album one you can listen to without skipping a song

Two words: MANNIE FRESH
13:24 - Mannie throwing a million miles per hour for the Hot Girls verse
One of the best videos on YouTube
Man, they totally turned up! They brought the New Orleans soul and party vibe all the way to Tiny Desk. I love so many other artists who have performewd on TD but to see artisits from my native state come in and just take it to the club is dope!
This was such a moment. Glad to have been of the right age to have experienced this music at its height! Hella disappointed he didn't do U Understand😫😫😫

Tiny Desk Tours !!!
Was 10x better than I could have ever imagined
The way I'm lit in this living room
OKAY BUT WHY IS ABSOLUTELY NOBODY ACKNOWLAGING THE FACT THAT TROMBONE SHORTY IS IN THIS
Great stage performance.
I only wanna hear slow motion like this for now on!!
In 2023 we’re just ignoring the deeply misogynistic lyrics because nostalgia? Seems out of step the values of NPR and many of it’s dedicated listeners.
That's that shyyyyt!
From the views an likes I think NPR Tiny Desk staff understands who their target audience is/should be 🤷🏾‍♂️💯 we need another late 90's/early 2000's Hip-hop artist ASAP.....keep up the great work cuz you have everyone here vibin
OMGGGGGG anytime you see John Baptiste smilin' & groovin you KNOW this is THE SH*! EVERY MOMENT was AWESOME but what LIT IT UP 4me was when they did  that Jazz Vibe Version of "Back dat @$$ up!!!" THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS NPR TINY DESK Y'ALL BE COMING THRU HARD!!!! This was not just PHENOMENAL esp for the Old Skool but HELLA FUN!!!
Juv needs to go on tour! Badass set
Definitely a top 5 ALL-TIME Tiny Desk... the last minute of this video is the most fun anyone has ever had at Tiny Desk. Such a vibe. Also, musically... it's composed for live instruments beautifully.
Put this on a CD
Give it up for the STRINGS!!!
My teenage years reinvented ❤ and I loved every minute of it.

HANDS DOWN THEE BEST
This def brought me back to my clubbing days
I loved the guy in the green shirt's reaction at 21:39.
Can't 4 get the AhhhMores
Juvie showed out! Instrumentation was insane! I love this for him
I love tiny desk, and the way this was one of the best I’ve ever seen/heard?!
This was the verzuz without the verzuz to make sure no one would try him 😳😬
Im going crazy in the living room and my kids looking at me like an alien.😅
Sad the homie B.G. couldn't be there
Juvi is what rap is about. it's about the pain, the stories, and the love . He made  it out the hood got married and looked in so much peace . Today's rappers are dead or in jail before they can mature smh .
Whhhaaattt!!!???? ❤❤❤❤❤
This was THE BEST Tiny desk ever!!
If you asked me how many Juvenile songs i remember the lyrics to. I’d have said 2 maybe 3. I was singing along (mostly ;) ) to every song.
This was EPIC!
🔥🔥🔥
This was everything!!! I danced ip something on my hubby.
Musical Genius ❤
I can’t get over how juvenile hasn’t aged! He looks soooo good and the same to me. This was so awesome!
🤘🏽🐐

The energy on this Tiny Desk was unmatched! For Juvenile to be at this age and able to do raw vocals in a full set like this is so impressive. This is just inborn talent and I am so thankful to grow up in the era to appreciate this. The live instrumentation and energy was just amazing!

One of the best tiny desk I've seen . Thank you ❤. Amazing . Great job by all parties involved
More hip hop and bands
We definitely needed this! 🔥🔥🔥
I can't wait to see them In October... I'm getting my tickets before they sell out.
He might as well capitalize off this and go on tour!! His catalog is big enough, mid sized venues for a more intimate feel would definitely sell out!!!
🔥😌🖤
This spoke to my soul! Juvie stays in heavy rotation from 99-2023!
I’m enamored❤
I want this at my wedding the whole set!! 😍 ❤
That was fire!!!!!
Juvenile the Great!!!!!
I love This! So authentic. That's my era I'm from KC but my grandma is from gibsland Louisiana. She called it down home 🙏💜 I never met anyone from there but I'm about to do a road trip and hit up everybody for a plate lol southern hospitality. I heard my people own some land that's producing oil and they owe us some change. He a Mr burns as mf I'm coming 💪

Masterpiece 🎶
Why is "Kim" in everybody songs 😂😂😂
I Luv it....
Takes me back. Lots of talent up there, cream rises to the top!
9:23 is an iconic moment. I love that they shined the spotlight on the NPR audience to let us see that eclectic group singing along and generally having fun.  Props to the Bass player because he was really lighting up the live version of "Slow Motion"; and that rendition of "Rodeo" is certainly a highlight.   Props to a great band, and Juvie & Mannie look great doing what they love. Thanks for the hits
What you came here for 7:52
This is the best Tiny desk performance ever! ❤
Good music 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Excellent
Great show!!

What an amazing show! Juvi killed this! And what can I say about Mannie, he brings so much joy to this!
Juvi legit has not skipped a beat, so clean.
This is hands down the best crowd interaction I’ve seen in a tiny desk. This is insane!
❤❤❤❤
I've never in my life seen a tiny desk encore. Shoutout to Juvi and the maestro Mannie Fresh.
Top 3 npr

Hard to top Mac Miller’s tiny desk, but Juvie just lit this mother up!
Mannie Fresh sounds exactly the same
🙏 I needed that!!! Huh?
I keep watching! This is so 🔥🔥🔥
This was LIT! I was vibin hard! Had to stand up and get INTO IT! 😂❤🏆 One of the top 5 for sure!
🔥 I'm rocking at the crib, first song 400 degrees I play whenever I find a jukebox
Slow Motion is awesome live with a real band behind it
One of the greatest things on the internets.
This was everything!!! 😃👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Come on pastor juvie 😅
It was already 🔥, and then he gonna bring out Jon Batiste, a little fuel on the fire. Man, it's like he wants to burn the whole joint down. Such an amazing tiny desk concert.
Shout out to New Orleans this really how rap started. I feel like I’m at a juke joint wit a lot of dancing, pool playing, smoke, and good food in tha back❤
Juvi the great mannie the goat
The tiny desk we didn’t know we needed ❤❤❤
OMG I never imagined rap sounding this mellow 😂😂 I love it 🔥🔥🔥
Yoooooooooo Juvenile who knew he would be the best yet
I’ll see you in Little Rock. I already bought my ticket.
This. This is what we needed! ❤😂
My top favourite tiny desk performance so far:  #4 Wu-Tang clan,  #3 juvenile, #2 Usher,  #1 GZA
Idk this was an elevated tiny dest. They brought the energy!!!
Yay! 3M views. I’ve been wearing this out.
I PERSONALLY SIGN OFF ON THIS!
Juvey gone always bring the hood out
It's Juvee!! And Manny Fresh!!!  All grown up. Loved this tiny desk.  A little nostalgic.. but vibin
My favorite part of all of this is that everyone had fun! Artist and crowd really vibed out! Hip hop cam absolutely be fun. Our Gen knows how ❤️💛💚
As we would have said in the 2000s -- this is fire 🔥
Great Show !!!
Im Back for a 2nd Time 😅❤
Who's the dude with the NPR shirt lol
This  like my 50th time watching this in one week. I need help
I don’t think we have ever seen Mannie not look happy, I know his energy, personality, and joy had to be contagious
The most legendary gents of my childhood
They had a whole Mardi gras magnolia party
This was awesome!  Such talent!
They still look young that is krazy
OOUUUUU MY MAN!! 😋
Juve!!! I remember seeing his video to Ha on juke box and his projects looked just like mine in Memphis TN.  Still same energy ! I love this!
Juvie put it down 🔥 DC NPR staff showed big love! Tiny Desk does it right from every angle 😎
Top 3 tiny desk
Bringing back memories of my late teenage days
These live instruments backing up Juvenile and Manny Fresh just gave me my whole life. This performance is FIYA!
I forgot how much I love Juvenile! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Reallly enjoyed this.
Bravo!! 👏👏👏👏

Now I can forgive him for “vax that thang up” haha
💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾
I enjoyed every minute of it!! Yassssss!!
Okaaaaay this was so good had me smiling and singing the whole time!!!!
❤❤❤❤
Manny rylo great auntie
My friend and I truly enjoyed this! Juvenile is why my friend loves hip hop music!
This was so good I’ve watched it a number of times! I don’t know if it’s because I’m just such a Juvie fan or it’s bc it’s just THAT good! I think it’s a mixture of both …actually I know it’s a mixture of both😂😩🙌🏾😍🥰❤️🐐🔥🐐  Loved seeing & hearing Mannie Fresh too! His verses stuck (with me) too— they make the songs even better lol 🐐🙌🏾😍
NATIONAL TREASURE right dere
Shoutout to the bass player!!!! Wow!! He didn’t do anything too special, he’s just fine 👀😭
All these years hearing this beat, I never knew that was Mannie Fresh singing.
Rip  Soulja slim 👑👑💯
I loved this but I wish he did his verse with Drag On. But I know that wasn’t a manny fresh beat but still lol
The best ever
One of the best ones hands down ! The best unexpected surprise
This was everything!!!! ❤❤❤
Juve spit a whole wayne verse.
😮😂😢 HAAAAAAAY STRAIGHT CHILZZZZ!!!
Forever & ever loving Juvie & Mannie ❤
Manny Fresh is underrated
This is dope .. I like how they rappin every word too rappers lip sing alot nowadays
I would love to be in the room!! Live band playing, and they still sound the same. I definitely would pay to see them perform in this setting.
The interaction on Slow Motion shows how music can unite us all. 🌹 This was a beautiful Tiny Desk highlighting a Golden Era. I'm appreciative!!
Is this...Manny Fresh?! 😊
3 Million views in a week 😮. I'm so happy this is spreading.
Please make this an album.
❤❤❤❤this was all that!!!
Juvie is a whole legend who doesn’t get pulled to the forefront enough so all the love to npr is valid smart choice here, and manny fresh as well🔥
OMG, this was incredible. I’ve been a Juvenile and Manny Fresh fan since ‘98. Thank you NPR for making this possible!
Can he record the album again with the live band? Juvenile, I'll buy it!
I just wanna shout out to my friend Jon (Tank) who ain’t with us no more. He would have loved this so much. Miss you Jon! RIP.
I'm 66 years  of  age. I had the time of my life!!! I will continue to contribute to NPR forever. I am a jazz fanatic, when I saw Jon Batiste and Trombone Shorty, I was too though 🎉🎉🎉🎉
The piano man knows what kind of moment he’s living in right now
NOLA DOES IT BEST! #1 City in the US at the very least! This video right here encapsulates many of the infinite reasons why my city is GOATED between the music, culture, people and really the overall vibes.    This is now right up there with Glbl Wrmng's "504" as one of my favorite songs/videos on my "This is NOLA" playlist
“How many times have you watched this”  Me: Yeap.
This is amazing. Take it on tour.
This was Nice, The Band was playing that Beat Nice
To the person who set this all up, you need a raise. This is like wine, getting better and better each min. First Mannie, then bringing out Shorty and Jon!
Didn't know I needed this 🙏
3 million views 🔥🔥🔥🔥 Hip hop pays the bills again 💪🏾💪🏾
💥🙌🏿💥
Love, love, love this!! And the fact that he bought Mannie with him, made my day. Great job Tiny Desk!!
This is so🔥🔥🔥🔥
They tore it down!!!! I could feel it through my screen 🔥 📺 🔥
Yassssssddd
Are we gonna brush over the fact Jon Batiste is here too.
You’ve totally outdone yourselves at the tiny desk.
He did my favorite rap song of all time..... this was insane.... i love life lol
This was the best tiny desk in the history of tiny desks
New Orleans is love.  It’s a different planet. People love love. There is no class difference.  Just music love.
This was absolutely fantastic! NPR tiny desk will never be the same !👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
So what had happened was…Juvie came and fcked DC and the world up. For the 99-2000s, for fckn EVEAH
I would of paid for it! Amazing
Not surprised that this is the best ever Tiny Desk performance. 🐐
Yes Sirrrrrr
I love them both! Mannie's producing is unmatched!
They should invite Juvenile back to do an hour
650 am and I’m dancing . This is 🔥
I love it sooooo much.
I’ve been watching tiny desk from the beginning and love all the artist. This is by far the best yet ✊🏽✊🏽

One of the hardest tiny desk
Good energy!!!!

My childhood 😢.. Juve is very underrated!! His songs always had that live band sound being that he’s from New Orleans. thank you tiny desk for this experience now I had to watch the usher one ❤❤❤❤
I can’t believe I’m just seeing this, awesome and legendary from my era! Very well done!!!!
Don’t mind me….just back again 😂❤️

Yes NOLA forever
Lets take a moment and appreciate those two beautiful and heavenly harmonic female vocals! ❤❤
New York always hating on hotboys they never wanna admit hotboys top 10 group of all time
People from around the world—thanks for watching! This represents so much NOLA cultural lineage all in one little concert. The dudes are carrying on jazz, brass band, funk, soul, hip-hop, bounce, and more. We are out here!!!!
Y'all are the highlight of my quarantine! What the world needs now is more Juve & Mannie Fresh 💲💲💲 "Baby lemme get the keys to the Rover Truck!" Dem Boyz Hot!🔥🔥🔥
This is the greatest. Idc
This ain’t even all of his songs ❤ shoutout to mannie too
He performs better then Wayne. Wayne voice is burnt out
I keep coming back to wat h this bc the energy was just so good! That stage presence and interaction even in an office...og perfomers!
Shoutout to Mannie Fresh  too he was the sound and glue to to cash money idc
Sh.t was classic. ✨

This is THE BEST  tiny desk concert.
Best tiny desk performance of ALL TIME! 🙌🏽
Still fly mf

Juvie the greatest
My tall brother at the back at 9:24 is all of us right now, living through this man as we go slow motion wit it.
I’m mad they didn’t do go DJ

Mans on the sax was mee whole time. shish had to be an honor!
BEST ONE 💯💯💯
💙
Too turnt
This brings so much nostalgia as I always had a soft spot for Juvie. I will say that people are right when some things are for your youth because after a min, it seemed awkwardaf trying to sophisticate his hits with a band 😂. Also, I love how it serves as a reminder that men love Back that Up and I need a Hot Girl, but start bitchin and moanin when Megan comes on the radio 🥴🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The laugh at 06:43 I love it😭🤣
That band did they thing fr
I'm back for like the 20th time😂😂😂
Them strings was going hard
This the best one yet‼️‼️‼️
I waiting to Wayne part I was ready to back it up baaaby

❤️‍🔥    Side note:  He and his wife celebrated their 19th year of marriage this year.
I love hip hop on live instruments
This was one of the BEST Tiny Desk Concerts.  To see NOLA legends Juve and Mannie Fresh, with the addition on Jon Batiste and Trombone Shorty, made my day.  The backing vocals were impeccable as well, including the violins. Thank you, NPR. Please keep these concerts coming!
Memories of my teenage years  in high school and rocking  to  cash money 👊
Mannie with the finger snap!
Had to come back and thank the camera crew and editing team, everyone involved un this project DID THEY JOB!!
This should have 8 million views, no less
Npr bling bling is not Juvenile song that B.G song
We have the 2023 version of unplugged. Thank you so much.  Tired of the computer music for the past decade.
New Orleans needed this right now! Thank you!
this is SOOO GOOD!
ITS PERFECTION! Thank you NPR 🎉
Social media really made this happen. OG never wanted to do it or know what Tiny Desk was!
Tiny desk, thank you for the parental advisory. I look forward to hear all types of music with better language.
Looks like everybody showed up to work that day...lol I've watched a lot of these tiny desks performances and this has been one of the bigger crowds.
Greatttttt performance. The energy was so good! Loved CMR since the beginning and it's so dope to she Juve and Mannie together doing this!
OMG I just got my whole life!!! 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
Thank you for this 💚
LOVE IT
One of the best I seen!!
Vibraslap MVP
They look like they had the best time of 2023!
I’m here for every bit of it!!!!! 🔥
Dope! 💥👏🏿
Best tiny desk ever
X is aging beautifully. the 99-2000 stay REPRESENTING. And tiny desk gave me trina... juve... like come on, yall showing OUT. I mean showing your entire A.... with these bookings.  Love it
🔥🔥🔥🙌🏾
Manny fresh making all, and I mean all of cash money earlier beats and hits will never be duplicated again
Get this man another album with these unplugs !
Girl in the green tee and locs is right on time with Manny, looks like fun ❤
Bring it!
This is about to hit 3 million views after only a WEEK?!!  Is that an NPR record, or what?!  🔥🔥

Best one yet frfr!!!!!ayyyyyyyyyy
💯🙏🏽Thank you💪🏽😎☝🏽
Straight 🔥
I've never heard a Tiny Desk crowd have this much fun. This rules
Legends!
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!  And the Juvie Juice product placement @3:48 is chef's kiss!! This has to be one of, if not thee BEST TD concert!
And Mannie came with that classic intro " Juuveeey"
Best one yet 🔥
5th time watching 🎶 🎵
Look at the musicians behind Juvie at 20:24 during “BTAU”  They already knew this was going to be legendary.
How is this not the most viewed video in internet history?
This was fyre
Absolutely came through on this one. EVERYONE was on point. This will no doubt be a go-to for me for a very long time.
legend
Juvenile just killed that whole set
"I'm not on the song but I'm in the video!" 😂
Amazing thanks npr!
This is a great example of a an idea remaining true to its origins while incorporating new elements and bigger names to become amazing. I really wish Verzuz would have gone this direction (staying true  to its roots) instead of turning into a boring version of concerts lol
That was straight up fire. Now that’s what you call a vibe. Energy was incredible start to finish
This what the BET Awards should be showing, not strippers and baby mamas
AHHHHH AND MANNY FRESH…..
I needed to hear juvie on fire too
😎
Mannie Fresh (Bling Bling).... 3:04
WHITE DUDE WAS VIBIN 9:26
I GET CHILLS EVERY MF TIME THEY START PLAYING back that thang up 🔥
Oh nothing, just here for the 7th time this week 🥰
They don’t rap like that no mo… Juvie the great for sure
Real talk Juvie could've been on Verzuz "I got hits after hits yeah"...Against who though 🤔
LEGENDARY!!!!!!!!!
As a 50-something year old white guy who doesn't even listen primarily to rap, this ranks up there with the Mac Miller (RIP) episode as two of my favorites.  There's something about putting these guys in this setting that really does something for me.
Juvies voice is one of the most distinctive in hiphop history.And his delivery is perfect.
this was the best tiny desk I have ever seen...the energy, the stage presence, the crowd interaction, the encore, the instrumentation, the EVERYTHING about this was on point.
Absolute worse tiny desk so far..this is what giving in looks like..tiny desk got punked for this one.
Me and the homies used to sing hot Boyz on the school bus. We was lit. Wed stop the whole class to sing this s* good times!
Back that @$$ ❤❤❤❤
One room I wish I was in because I’ve listened to this every day since it came out 😌 It makes my day!
🔥
I was waiting on ghetto children in the beginning! Still good regardless!💯
This 🤡 was pushing vaccine. FOH!
Fa da city.... ya heards me!!!!!
Bro 😂😂 this is goated and long time overdue honestly
It’s the horns for me!! But I see the 8M views,I’m probably responsible for about 100 of those
Never would’ve thought juvy would have the best tiny desk performance
I've never seen a TDC this wild. Audience participation was 🔥
When you used to drink liquor, now you sip wine.
20+ years of fun, industry changing music. Keep entertaining us!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Let’s get this to 15 million!!
This was everything! Now I’m sweating 😂 the fact that I was a little girl when this came out and I used to be in front of the tv dancing now I’m 31 😅
One of the best !!! I thoroughly enjoyed the set and cannot believe I was listening to this music when I was 12 🤣
we need MORE like this!🔥
🔥
It was so lit in this session they actually showed the audience 🔥🙌🏽
Chris brown tiny desk needs to be next
That was superb 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Has Wayne been on tiny desk? If not we definitely need that
It’s great to see Juvie ha the OG Hot Boy yea ⭐️ still going 400 Degreez & the big homie Mannie Fresh 😎 *childhood restored
Ain’t Bling Bling BG song?
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥rodeo thoooo mannnn
WHY AM I SO DANG PROUD OF HIP-HOP AND MUSIC AND JUST LIFE RIGHT HERE?!  THIS FEELS LIKE SUMMER FUN AND JOY! And how is there THIS MUCH GORGEOUSNESS ON THESE INSTRUMENTS?!?!?!?!?  BLACK MEN!  I SAID IT AND I MEANT IT!
This is well deserved. Juvenile, had me acting a fool at home watching this. Thank you tiny desk for this.
npr , please get peso pluma
They are having so much fun this is awesome
Already one of the best Tiny Desk Concerts.  Ever!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

This was, by far, my favorite Tiny Desk to date.
Mannie fresh deserves his flowers. Wouldn't be cash money without his beats. I dont understand why he dont make beats now and if he does why nobody hopping on them.
Send them in your
Thank you to Juve, Manny Fresh and all the Musicians in support for answering the call 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾!  This was definitely one of the BEST Hip Hop performances on Tiny Desk!

Neither of them age! 😍
What really makes so happy with this whole thing , Juvenile is just so wholesome with that huge smile while singing. Especially during that encore. Well done Tiny Desk , y'all always create beautiful content but this elevated it for me. 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
This one here. I felt like I was there!!!❤
I absolutely loved that We could understand every single word. I was singing right along.  now we need Juvie to give us a concert for all of us that’s 35+ that grew up in that era. Oh and Juvie STILL fiiiiiiinnnneeee. Gotta give props to Manny he still the the man on these beats thank you Manny we need you and I know it was your genius idea to go with a live band very tasteful, and it worked out well
The strings and horns....Yes!!!!

Might have got yourself a Grammy Tiny Desk 🔥
Favorite TDC So far!!!! What took so LONG????!!!! ⚜⚜⚜⚜⚜
This Juvie Tiny Desk sounds great listening to it in your car. The band is 🔥.The best episode so far.
I watched it live and I've watched it 5x since while dancing around like a fool and I did not forget to stretch 😂😅
It’s great seeing mannie fresh especially with juvenile !
NPR just evolved to a higher level
The way I smiled through this whole tiny desk, OMG!!!! This one was overdue!!!! I love seeing Juvi and Manny together with such good energy!!!! Them horns tho, the backup singers, strangs yes strangs, Jon Batiste and Trombone Shorty.....chiiiiiile❤

I really enjoyed Juvenile and Mannie Fresh’s concert! It took me back. When Set it Off came on I couldn’t contain myself and then i was on my feet for the rest of the performance
This era of music was dope!!!
Vibes👊🏻🖤
I cannot stop watching this. And we ran into him on a humble at essence fest! Still messed up. Juvie the great!
Ooooo we I know the black people had to hold back! That music definitely make you wanna get up and shake sum!
Woah
Let's go I love that s*** For the Love of New Orleans
Let's be clear, a phenomenon like this - where one of the raunchiets artists in Hip Hop merge with philharmonic classical musicians for a stripped down (no pun intended) concert - only happens in America. I like it here.
THIS WAS A GREAT SHOW FROM THE BIG HOMIE, HE WAS JUST IN MY CITY OF THIBODAUX A FEW WEEKS BACK WHERE THE (HOT BOYS) STARTED OFF THERE FIRST "TOUR CONCERT" AT. I REALLY HEARD ALL OF THE LYRICS CLEARLY IN THIS VERSION FROM THE SONG'S THAT I WAS SINGING WRONG BACK IN THE DAY JUVIE THE GREAT...💪🏾
Aw he was so sweet. I would’ve loved to be there for him 🎉❤
19:01 is why Juvie is the King of Wedding receptions. Name a wedding reception where this song was not played. All cultures, all places, all wedding sizes.
One of the best shows I’ve seen on Tiny desk! Loved this❤
To know he still rocking after so many years. Even with loosing Soldier, his own child and mother of his child he is still here giving us the best of Nola❤
I miss this old cash money before they wore pink nails lol
Lit🙌🏾
It’s the 2.8 mill views for me 🙌🏽
That was great!
We need North East Groovers on there if possible
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
1st artist to have an ENCORE 🔥
We need Project Pat!!!
Heeeeyyyyy!!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤
Manny motha fuckn fresh..
This was everthaaaaang! ❤ I sang every word!! 😂
Best collaboration on Tiny Desk ever!!!!!
I been a fan of Juvenile for a hot min. I’m a whole AC unit now!
I smiled this whole set! Great memories🎉❤
That violinist was feeling it the 2nd time around haha straight jammin! Such a classic
Juvenile didn't come to play with it..💐💐
👏👏👏👏🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤
Can we talk about how Mannie Fresh looks the same 23 years later
This literally took me back! Cash Money needs a reunion tour!
Omg I INSTANTLY clicked when I saw this on my algorithm ❤❤❤❤
I need all these tracks remixed and released with the same backing band and singers. 12:54 - I need a hot girl ❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
This is Juvie “Jadakiss” moment Jada had at the Versus. One of our best hip hop artist ever.
Every millennial right now 🦗🦟🦗🦟🦗🦟🦗🦟🦗
This brought a few tears to my eyes. I was in Jr High, High School when when Cash Money and No Limit were in their prime, ‘97 to early 2000s. Those years were and always will be the most memorable to me and having Cash Money and No Limit as the soundtrack to my life during that time was a blessing. I’ll always  associate one of the greatest periods of my life with legends like Juve, Hot Boys, TRU etc. Seeing and hearing this was such an honor 🥹
Amazing performance. Just a special shout out to the brass section, killing it.
I was smiling the whole 28 minutes 🎉🎉 😊 they did that 🔥
13 year old me knowing word for word 😂😂
🔥🔥🔥 2.6 mil in 6 days
Was in a bad mood, this just made my day
This looks too fun
Juvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvy the great
White people love gangster rap
Next desk should be lox or dipset
Nobody can say Mannie Fresh not in the producer Hall of Fame 🔥🔥
Mann y'all got me in here SWEATING!! I can't sit down because every song that comes on make me wanna move!! LOL I cannot describe how it feels to see these guys do these classics with a live band after all these years... I love it and please keep em coming!! Shout out to Juve and the Hot Boys!!
I heard he's from the hood, apparently he represents Power
They ACTUALLY HAD Project B*tch on NPR. F*CK YEAH!
That to me.... would've been the most incredible concert of my life! I'm from the SF Bay Area...but I know some Legends when I see them!  Those players still got it.
Fire! 🔥
Best Tiny Desk ever!!!! My teen years!! Soooo nostalgic!! Thank you NPR!!
One of the best things ever.
That was better than some of they’re sold out arena’s concerts much respect and love to juvie and fresh for that two old school pioneers
Tiny desk falling off.
Did not realize how bad I needed to hear the jazz ensemble live version of 400 Degrees
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Got yo block on fire, till the moment you expire 🎵🎶🎵🎶
Juvenile was solid until Vax That Thang Up
I could hear this on Bridgerton 😂😂😂
True musicians have no bounds. God Bless
Thank you NPR for giving us another way of listening to some awesome music! This was incredible, but Manny fresh needs his own tiny desk! Gotta get Twista on here as well! ( make sure he brings Do or Die with him too)
I love these 😊 they really showed out and received the crowd so well !
Mannie fresh the real goat for real he produced all of them cash money hits every single one
Free B.G. Friday
WE NEED A HOT BOY REUNION TOUR!
This was fun!
This might be the BEST TINY DESK EVERRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!! I felt like I was in the building
Now we need a Lil Wayne Tiny Desk.
That was Top Shelf, Juvenile love it
FLAWLESS VICTORY!!!!!!!!!
Mannie Fresh has immaculate vibes..never seen him w/o a smile!!
When the only venue that is available is a school campus during the summer off.
This is one of the best performances on tiny desk in such a long time. But I am always reminded that tiny desk hates punk and metal music, any type of music that can’t be listened too by moms. They really need to branch off from indie pop it’s abhorrent to think that there is only one type of music that’s only curated by your friends. Branch out, explore, because as of right now your failing anyone that’s remotely into music at all. It would be amazing to see someone like Henry Rollins playing black flag songs or mastodon on acoustics or opeth doing a hybrid death metal and ballad set.  Tl;dr This is awesome, i am disappointed that tiny doesn’t have heavier music on their docket.
He got old lol
Juvie and Manny are TIMELESS. The view count shows it. 2.6M in 6 days! They can still hang! The best era of music! I would’ve paid to be in this room!
Juvie need to go back to this style
One of the best tiny desk.. period ❤❤❤
🔥
@Peachz674 0 seconds ago I can hear this all day Yeah!!!
🤯
I put my hands up!!!!
Props this was nice and well needed haa
THIS IS HOW YOU CELEBRATE 50 YEARS OF RAP. Let’s go NOLA!
Now imagine a white musician saying all those things. "mysoginyst", "hateful", "glamorising gun crime"  Don't get me wrong I like the music, but if you're wondering why gun crime is at an all time high, look at pop culture and what is being celebrated.
Cringe
Mf got me singing I need a project bish 😂
Best Tiny desk ever!
Absolutely incredible, takes me back to the late 90s and early 2000s. Juvie an absolute legendary artist!
I wanna see plies do one
One of the dopest performances!
Nobody can top this tiny desk concert. This is goated
Going in history book!! This was amazing
7:00 Mannie is undefeated in ad libs and he doing that ish live... GOAT
The best Tiny Desk performance !
Some of my best memories to this here music
400 degrees is one of my all-time favorite jam
What the world didn't know that it needed. THIS WAS SO 🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Imma need this burned on a cd please and thanks

This is a gem!
That was incredible
I love it. I love Juve.
Truly a masterful performance in a class of its own.
For the muthaphuckin culture!!!!
I love the fusion of all the different genres here. Just wish they would clean up the lyrics a little on formats such as this.
This is absolutely AMAZING!!!!! ❤
4th time watching this in 2 days.  Love how the NOLA inspiration is apparent in this live version.  Manny fresh is a genius and Juve is a straight G.  Man I wish he would come drink beers with me!!!
Put Juve in the Hip Hop Honors and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame next year.
I Mean some of dem songs they couldn’t play out because it’s was a lot of cussing And stuff hahaha, because I was ready to be like 😜😜🤣

400 Degreez 🎯
AWESOME
When they've got the energy, audience engagement and hype from the very opening, you know it's going to be a classic.
We need a Big Tymers joint soon
They ate that up
I’m greedy but imagine if this had been the whole Cash Money! Wayne, BG. Bro they were the Wu of Nola. Like if you agree
Bye manny screaming in set it off I thought that was part of the beat as a kid 😂
They slayed Rodeo! Hella soul there😊👍!
The fact he remembers all the words 🎉
Juvenile still sexy
All I could so was smile the entire time. This was everything 💜
Why am I up at 530am playing this on my phone in the dark next to a greedy newborn 😂😂😂😂😂
Do we know who the guitarist is? 😍😍😍
I just wish they could come up with different lyrics, but I guess its their experience.
Easily a Top 5 Tiny Desk performance!!!
Mystikal next, please.  💜💚💛💜💚💛
This by far has been one of my favorites!!!
THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS IVE SEEN IN A LOOONNNNG TIME!!!!!!!

Imagine if Turk and BG were there. Imagine!
Magnoliaaaa
The seniors citizens i worked with when i was a teen listened to old jazz, but we gone be listening to Juve when we get that age
This one, and Charlie Wilson are my personal favs.  They got that energy.  I appreciate each, and every performance, and radio show that NPR provides us.  Thank y’all NPR.  Mannie Fresh is a genius.  It’s been a long time since I’ve seen a crowd ask for an encore 💐 .
The best!!!! ❤❤❤
Wayne is just doing well without them Now. He doesn't call or write them.😂

Please Juvie- an entire album of live music and all your hits!
Just in case you forgot Juve had bangers!!! 🔥 🔥
Mannie Fresh is one of the BEST producers,  EVER. So incredibly innovative,  talented and unique. Juvenile did exceptional on this as well! 2 of a New Orleans best right here!
Think about mannie but all those different sounds together. This what you call a God of production.
Shot out to Mannie Fresh for the production to make this work for Tiny Desk.

Always love when any of the old crew gets together wether its for an interview or performance like this. Manny and Juvie gave us timeless classics. Glad to see everyone in the comments giving them their flowers
I was really hoping for "cash money records taking over for the 99 and the 2000"
You can tell mannie is sooo happy! I am too bud! Lol This was amazing 🤩
Wish this version was on Apple Music🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️
Juvie definitely did this hit after hit ….. fresh definitely was a hit maker
Loving the live Hip-hop band!!! Give Juvenile and Mannie Fresh all they flowers 💐🌼💐💯
This is so great!
The fact that he didn’t even know what Tiny Desk was at first 😭 came and shut it down ❤️
For when I come back 🔥 it’s the stretch for me! 0:53 400 DEGREEZ 3:06 BLING BLING 4:35 HA 6:06 SET IT OFF 7:53 SLOW MOTION 10:06 RODEO  12:54 I NEED A HOT GIRL 15:34 PROJECT CHICK 19:01 BACK THAT THANG UP
This brings back so many memories for me
Wooooooooo!
This was everything!!!!❤
The 400 Degreez intro gave me chills. Reminded me of listening to the album as a kid
The homies held it down 🔥
This is everything 😊
A black kid whole entire childhood in 28 minutes with a twist of course...it don't get no better than this.❤ This was lit asf🔥🔥
Yaaaas!!!!!
This was SOOOOOO GOOOODDDD!!!! the Tiny Desk I never knew I NEEDED❤😁🧚🏾‍♀️🪄💫✨🔥🔥

Yesssssssssssssssssssss🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Best NPR Concert.
Yawl see the violinist head bobbin...LOL This is what the world needs. I have watched this like 20 times.... It was the most .. I dont even have the right words to describe it... Yall know what im trying to say... if yah know then yah know...
This. Is. Art.
This Tiny desk gave me life in my little cubicle in the CBD!! He did an amazing job at essence festival and keep advocating for yourself brother!! Who is this man on the bass in the back next to the drummer? 👀 I love my New Orleans men!!
This was amazing!
My guy Juvie look so happy. Certified legend. Hard work pays off
Yeah them New Orleans boys always knew how to put on a show
Can someone get Juve a coozie?
🔥 🔥🔥
We needed that encore, bad.
So hype about this and proud of Juvenile! Great set
Legendary
This is so dope.
You can tell the sax man a real fan. He so hyped
🔥
Can we do more of this! I would see this in concert forreal
You have no idea what you have witnessed. This is one of those special moments that only happen once in a blue.
🔥 🔥
So good!! I can’t believe they still sound the same had goosebumps and really enjoyed this one!
💯🔥
🔥🔥🔥
Purely the best!!!🎉
This was everything...what a time to be alive in this ERA
All this needs is a weezy cameo
Juve's catalog is so deep you forget bro had heat since like 95
It take for us to add that New Orleans flavor to that Tiny Desk stage!!!!
The fact I didn't realize how much my spirit needed this.
Beautiful it's good to see all races coming together singing a song about woman backing there hind quarters up 😂
I need a job working at npr asap! Y’all need a makeup artist?
Usher had the Best Tiny Best performance but this is a close second. Took me back to 1999-2000 😂
That live band cut up on back DAT thang up🔥
They need to tour this. A Cash Money lineup w a live band would be killer.
When they started to set up the violins, you knew what time it was. 🔥
Juvie kinda looks like Michael Jai White 😅
As a Louisiana native.. this his made my heart smile…Juviiiieeee❤
This is so good!
The most energy I have seen on any of the Tiny Desk. Well done Juvie, Mannie, The Band and the audience .
I've listened to this about 10 times so far don't see me stopping anytime soon
The crowd just doesn’t look like they grew up on that 400 degreez and Solja rags or maybe it’s me
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The person that made this happen, you the real mvp. The live band is bangin!!!! Feels good to see Juve and Mannie Fresh having so much fun with it
New Orleans Bound🎉🎉🎉
They was VIBINNNNNN
This was my era. I enjoyed the spin with the band and the ladies. This was hot!!
J. Cole needs to do a Tiny Desk.!!
19 years ago, my two brothers and I ate a healthy dose of Mississippi's finest shrooms. we listened to Slow Motion for 8 hours straight...... change my life. Always a place in my heart for Juve.
This versions of tunes I ddnt know I needed!!!! 🙌🏾🔥🔥🔥
This makes me so happy for so many reasons. Ratchet and respectable!
Yes! Yes! Yes! 🩵🎶🩷🎶💯🎊
Juvenile did his thang
I would LOVe to be in this audience!!!
Live Band and Hip Hop is the Lick
Clicked like before the first 5 seconds of this video!!! Omg #99-2000!

Sick
Let's be clear, WITHOUT the architect of Cash Money, we WOULD NOT have Lil Wayne, Nicki Minaj, Drake, etc... We all owe a debt of gratitude to Juvenile & Mannie Fresh!!
Juvie just took the crown from Anderson Paak ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
No backup audio, all the instruments being played will all soul from the musicians. This is concert vibe that need to stay in constant rotation every show.
This is better than the last 18 years of the BET Awards lol
Juvenile is talented and he stands the test of time quite frankly. I thoroughly enjoyed this.
Easy top 3 Tiny Desk performance.....#1??!?! 🔥 either way 🙌
One of the best ones yet!!!!! Salute Juvi! Mannie and the N.O Flava!!
Now Tiny Desk, stop capping and put me on! Because I know I can do it and hype a crowd to vibrate higher 💫.

Greatest Tiny Desk ever!!!!!! 💜
AYEEEEE
20:07 🥲🤗
The live music was 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 too.
People still listen to this guy after Vax That Thang Up? After selling out to Big HARMa get rewarded. Let he who will be deceived be deceived. He owes his followers an apology at minimum.
Classic!
Only fitting bc it’s 400 degrees in Houston!
Rodeo is my song ❤
Legendary
down souf LEGEND
amazing
Yo this is GENIUS 😭
JUVI AND MANNIE F. you made your day ones PROUD BIG DAWGZZZZZ
Just incredible
Love Juvenile gettin his flowers💯🔥🔥🔥
Perfect match up!
Give him a Las Vegas residency right now. He would sell out every show
This was for the 99 to the year 2000
I’ve watched this way to many times ❤❤😊
This is the beauty of Nola musicians... they are truly artist and geniuses and have a great ear for music and putting on a production. Love the band and happy that he brought his partner Mannie Fresh along for the right. The love and respect between them is felt!
This is 🔥🔥🔥🔥 definitely a classic performance
"Rodeo" 🥹🥹😭
Salute
Never been a moment in history that Manny fresh lost a drop of respect! Seems like Solid guy in comparison to birdman
Can we all agree that the background singers were FLAWLESS!! Top tier!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Best performance ever since i saw it. Great
Rodeo is giving me chills!???? Sht i never thought would happen, but here we are
Sell out type of dudes wit no real hustle.  These ninjas did "Vax that thang up"  for them people! Got paid to misinform their own people. AND NO I WOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT TOO. YOUR SOUL IS WORTH MORE! 😢
At home concert 😊😊
I sang every song
🔥
JUVE!!!
He opened with 400 Degrees.  My all-time favorite Juve song! Loved this set.
Damn...I have not gone clubbin' in like 6 years and it doesn't interest me BUT if I was there, I would be actin' a fool on the last set. 😅 👀💃🏽
Those 2 ladies sound so beautiful ❤️
26:41 is oddly wholesome and very satisfying to witness 🥲

I was literally cheesin the whole time !! 😆
Yesterdays's price is not today's price!!!!! JUVE THE GREAT!!!
Mannie doing the “ohh” live is crazy🔥🔥🔥
This is what I didn't know that I needed   But I did
you can really hear New Orleans within that band. pretty awesome. just real music.

Men this was a great tiny desk hats off Juvenile and Manning Fresh
Juve Juice 🥤
I would have been fired cause I would have been twerking on that bookshelf on the front 😂💃🏾
This dude Juvenile had so many classics man
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Felt like high-school again. KILLED IT!!!!
This is my third watch of the day! This was such a great performance! I hope Juve and Turk make up because I need him and Wayne on stage for a performance.
When you date your uncles to perform like they used to back in the day and they come thru 😂😂😂
yeah )
👏👏👏👏👏🕺🕺🕺🕺🕺🎺🎺🎺👏👏❤❤🕺🕺
Omg didn't realize how many hits he had
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Aaaaaaayyyyeeeeee
This was the best one
Did He Perform  “VAX DAT THANG UP”??!!??
juvenile still one of the best
🔥🔥🔥
I love all the old cash money but i didn't like it at all the beats change a lil bit period it wasn't good
Is it possible to have him come back and perform other song? I have a few more I need to hear in this setting.
Probably the best tiny desk show I’ve seen. 🤘🏻
I think this has to be my favorite tiny desk performance so far! This is 🔥🔥🔥!! I’ve watched this at least 5 times! And counting!🖤
He told y’all vax that thang up 😂😂😂😂
Na'eemah Rani
If only lil Wayne showed up that would've been❤❤
This was awesome! I aint never seen the Tiny Desk break the 4th wall...but I was here for it! Leave it to Juvenile and Manny Fresh...doing it "for the 9-9 and the 2000's!" lol 🤭✨
WAYNE, where are you!!!
At 14:30 I just knew Turc was gone make a surprise cameo.
Dope juvenile 🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
Manny fresh said he ready now😂😂😂 too cute.
I need a Juve concert at the House of Blues here in Dallas ASAP 🔥
Juvi with the best performance!! Really enjoyed it. Literally the Jets performance. Take notes people…
When juve slides in on bling bling that’s smooth
Bling bling lowkey the best song on the whole set
Love it! Juvenile is one of my faborite favorite hip hop artists❤❤
This is so dope. This give his music soul I love the concept of this.
Fire!
The best Tiny desk!! HANDS DOWN..
Not enough of y’all are talking about how he said : WHOODESK!!
Killed it! Love my generation! 💯🔥💯🔥💯🔥
Juvie SNAPPED!!! That is all.
We really needed this 🙌🏾🔥 best Tiny Desk ! He got so comfortable when he realized everyone knew the words and that he could get as comfortable as they wanted to!🙌🏾
I wish I could 👍🏾 this a million times! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
One time for the strings!! Really enjoyed this! 💕
🔥🔥🔥🔥
This was legendary ♥️
Caint wait till he come to ft wayne this month ayyeee❤😊
🔥
Best tiny desk concert!!! Period!!!
I love how Tiny Desk seems to be pretty firm on the 3 song rule and that is just completely not the case with this one. Good stuff!
Love the energy from the crowd with that "slow motion" jam🔥🔥🔥  RODEO still my favourite juve track❤
Y’all done put everybody on Tiny Desk except Erykah Badu and Susan Carol
Legendary
This whole video went so hard
Great show
I love that he was able to be himself and in his element. It’s no Juvenile if it’s not explicit that’s the only way you feel his music! Encore! Encore!
Wow , now I see why he’s called Juve the Great , this was classic 🎶 hits afte hits
Excellent!! I loved it! Thanks yall. 👏🏾👏🏾
Juvie need all his flowers 💐 Best performance so far 👏🏾
I need an acoustic version of rodeo now bc this is heaven
I rarely comment but this was ART!!!!
I was disappointed in this tiny desk episode.  Usually they are spot on with the artist they choose, could have done better.
Best tiny desk ever
Just straight uncut dopeness!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥
Slo motion for me ❤
Nola is one of the few accents I enjoy. Juvenile is so country and seems like he'll have some one laughing all night at the family bbqs. This was definitely entertaining. Mannie fresh and Juve are a dynamic duo for sure and bounce off of each other beautifully.
9:24 Look at white boy there probably named Tyler or Logan 😂
My childhood
And the band is even cleaner in headphones or the car they showed out Frfr 🙌🔥🔥🔥🔥💯

This was one of the best tiny desks performances. It was so refined, classy and ratchet all at once. It aged just perfectly for the audience. I felt like putting on a ballroom gown and twerkin 😂😂😂
AMSZING !!!!!!!
The handshakes before the encore though!! 🤣😂
Come on Juvie and Mannie!!! Yes I'm backin that thang UP!!!
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
I want him to go on tour with a live band. I’ll be front row!
Hands down the best rappers in the game !… NOLA
Legendary
I'm just saying we need a Fetty Wap Tiny Desk
I'm so glad to see Juvie and Manny Fresh still rocking together
NPR backed that tiny desk up!!
“Like” if you had chicken skin this whole set. Salute Juvie and Manny Fresh and that band!
BEST TINY DESK!!!!!
I been watching ALL the tiny desks and I was vibin' throughout, I NEEDED THIS MANE!!!!!!
Legendary
Oh I would've been cutting up at my cubicle 💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾, I know HR would've been emailing the next morning. 🤷🏾‍♀️🤣
this was fireeeeee imagine we had Wayne
He still looks so healthy and happy! Love to see! Nice set❤❤❤
The trumpet players face at 12:58 😂😂😂
I guess I’m the bad guy in this movie… dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun here come juvie
This single Tiny Desk tells you all you need to know about NoLA.🔥
Classic 🔥
Yesssssss this was a whole vybw
Never knew we needed this! Love it!
Aye Tiny Desk y’all gotta bring Weezy on this.. it’s only right 😊
I'm just mad they didn't do she get it from her mama 😢
Love it!! 🔥🔥🔥
Just reminiscing about my middle school days. Can’t believe I’m seeing Juve and Mannie on tiny desk
Mfs get confused when I say Juve in my top 5... like how not.. man's a excellent story teller ... just kept it 💯 and never went main stream... ask Wayne
_Tiny Desk_ is the new _...Unplugged._  Absolutely love it.
So nice to see DC artist The Amors sing BG for him! Mannie looks so happy! 😁
broooooooo thissssss issssssssss 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
One of them sound like Chloe Bailey 🥰
Lowkey my child hood lol
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Juvi has ALWAYS been one of my all time favorites, I always bump him that I put my teenage boys on - it’s his voice!
So so so good!
Juvenile, Mannie, backup singers, band, crowd...everything on point! 🙌🏻
Definitely the best one 100 it's official juvie could been a blue's singer
Testament of juvenile 2.5 million views
Oh my goodness. People were looking at me in my car like I was crazy. Thanks cash money crew 🎉❤my college days music 🎼
This was the tiny desk I never knew I needed omg I loved every bit
Classic.
I didnt realize how much this was needed!!!! JUVE & Crew killt It!!
Still got it Salute
13:26 I know that’s right Mannie Fresh!!! Go awf!!!! 🙌🏾🙌🏾🔥
Noticed how Mannie censored himself a lot over the more profane lyrics, i respect that,he probably feels hes not that same 20 something yr old who said those lyrics over 20 yrs ago
Meh.. used to like this artist until he started pushing the jab agenda  for the elite. So sad.
The thing I like the most about this is that 20 years later they look like they're still having so much fun.
This made me feel for the world that we don’t get to see a pac or biggie tiny desk
If it wasn’t for juvenile there would be no lil Wayne drake nicki and the rest of the gang juvenile did his big one with this ❤
That RODEO!!!!! ❤❤❤
This straight up put me in a really good mood! Made my day better
Juvenile need a while orchestra behind him
He had so much fun doing this 😂😂🎉
Them strings was not playing 🔥💪🏾❤️
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This is by far the hottest one🔥🔥🔥❤❤❤
THIS FIREEEEEEE
This boy Hot!!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🙌🙌
This was Great!
YASSSSS!!!!!!! JUVI!!!!!
Iconic
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This took me back to my Middle/High School days....

Juve the KING!!
Mannnnn...Juve is incredible.....no flaws...spitting it all like the record....give this man his flowers!
Thank you NPR for letting artists be artists and for sharing it with us, unrestricted. ❤
If this was album it’d be #1 in America 🥰
A vibe ❤❤❤❤
We need a second performance please 🙏🏽🙏🏽❤️🔥🔥🔥
Bruh, fire. Ya heard?! 🔥 ❤ 😂 😊
Man the classics!! The live band killed it!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Juvie and Mannie left it all on the field. Great energy.
THIS IS MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE TINY DESK!!! OMG SO MANY MEMORIES!!
This Tiny Desk concept is GENIUS ❤Thank You
This had me hype like it's 99
Love their energy 🙌🏽🙌🏽❤ I’m from this generation 🙌🏽🙌🏽
now this is a great TINY DESK session!
Juvi came back to remind erbody who tf he was.
Juvenile is underrated
Epic ❤💞👌🏾
Louisiana Vibes Unmatched Great Performance & Commentary Luv 318 to 504
26:02 😂😂 swear this is the first encore in Tiny Desk history.
Love it!
haha yessss
I seen a few chicks look like Mannie Fresh in the face, but the energy was great , Mannie was all into it,  even though it wasn’t his tiny desk , he gave it up with Juve, good friend
😂😂😂 The ghettoest songs ever but telling their truth.😂😂 The instrumentation was crazy.
They did that legendary
THE BEST TINY DESK EVER! That Back That * Up WE NEEDED THAT IN OUR LIFE FRESH AND JUVI YALL ARE LEGENDS!
The BEST!!! JUVENILE
🐐
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
just donated to NPR as thanks
I keep coming back ☺️🔥😍  His breathe control amazing 🤩 then Mannie fresh there too 😮🔥💃🏾🔥💃🏾💃🏾
I do believe this is the best TDC I've seen so far 🤔! It would've been really dope if all the Hot Boys were free or on the same page. A surprise joint or two from them would've been extra trippy.
This was awesome! I know I watched this 5 times!
This totally made my day.
We need that version of RODEO THOUGH 👀
People don't realize how much these guys contributed to hip hop culture, and even other people's careers. Without Juve, you probably don't have Lil Wayne, for example. At least not the way we came to know him.
The best ever
Juve still on fire so many years later 🔥 Both he and Mannie clean AF
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Classic.... legendary
I respect the artistry of Juve for real
OKAY JUVI!!!!!! I love seeing the OG’s showing out and giving us the vibes… you know you a legend when all your music still feel fresh.
The only tiny desk that the artists repeat a song because the crowd is asking him to. Amazing performance!! 👏
❤❤❤
I enjoyed this
Hands down one of the best Tiny Desk concerts 🙌
This is terrible 😂
tell me he plays back it up
Prayer answered! Juvie the greaaat!
Mannn Juvie the goat been a fan since 2nd grade. 337 to the 504
I wish I was there, that was too lit 🔥. Thanks Tiny Desk
Yes Sir, love the band, especially the horn section, strings, and the Amours. Juvie, and Mannie Nice, come on South!!!
2.5M views says it all!!! 💯💯
Wow great show 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is amazing! One of the best Tiny Desk performances!
Plz plz plz give Manny and Baby a Tiny Desk. Big Tymers would be so good. Maybe even a long slot where they have time to introduce some special guests. This Juve is GOLDEN for sure ngl!
Got me over here twerking at my desk at work 😂💁🏽‍♀️
You are telling me you get great music from NPR and no ads.
Juvenile and Mannie Fresh are craftsmen in their art. This is awesome!
I can't believe I still knew every word to every song....classic awesomeness
Mannie fresh!!!!!
The 2nd best tiny desk I've ever seen. 1st is Mac♡
Gotta thank  black Twitter for this
The best performance thus far 🖤 hits after hits 🐐✊🏾
sounds just as good live as he does on a record
They don't make music this real and black no more.. 90s if you miss it you miss it 💯💯💯
taking it back to 99-2000s 💃🏻💃🏻
So dope
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽🔥🔥🔥💯
Man this was 🔥🔥 I just wished Juvi could have preformed his "Down Bottom" verse
Louisiana in this thang 🔥🔥🔥🔥
nice
Epic....now go get OUTKAST!!!!!!
Juvenile should DEFINITELY record all his greatest hits with the live band . I Wouldn't be able to stop playing them!!!!
I love this so much
Don’t mind me just twerking 🤸🏽‍♀️minding my business lol this is so amazing!!!
For sure amazing musical talent, and as a white kid from Houston in the 90’s I’ve been enjoying this music for most of my life. I was actually born in Ireland, but these guys are just pure artists.
GADDAMN!!!!! I WISH I COULD'VE BEEN IN ATTENDANCE FOR THIS ONE!!!!! I would've been TWERKING AND ALLADAT!!!🙌🏾🤸🏾‍♀️😭😭😭😭🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Slow motion … the band was having a GREAT time.
Juvie and Mannie tore dat bih down ya heard me!!

🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🫶🏾🫶🏾🫶🏾🫶🏾🫶🏾
By far one of the best Tiny Desk concerts I've seen!
Wow.
time to hit that NPR donation rite NAHH
❤
Juvenile is the kind of success story that encourages me as an underground artist with a small following. Seeing how he’s developed his skills and slowly blown up after seizing each and every opportunity he’s been giving has been inspirational! Mans has quickly become a mainstay in the industry and for good reason. Dude is too nice! I know if I put in the work, I can reach a larger audience some day too, but for now, I’m happy being a supporter. My turn will come too. Salute to Juvenile🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I need this every morning to get me ready for the day!!!!❤❤❤
This is the greatest Tiny Desk Concert. Ever. Juvi the Great.
More Juvee PLEASE!!!!
This was exactly the thing I didn't know I needed in my life right now 😅👏
This my favorite one!

Omggggg this whole concert is/was the soundtrack to my 20s. God I misssssss the late 1990s and early 2000s. LIFEEEE WAS SOOOO FREAKING GOOD! ❤. Before social media,  when we actually enjoyed life & wasn't busy recording erythang for social media. I always tell my kids.. THIS ERA SUCKS! 😂🤣
Boy that Juvenile...you don't know? He on fire. 17" Momos. Black magic on them tires.
Great performance from Juvenile..its an incredible reminder Juvenile has under his belt..in that same vein, Mannie Fresh is the ultimate producer, that man has CATALOGS!

Brings back memories as a kid riding in my Dad's Cadillac 😂😂

Listened to this at the beginning of my work shift and when i tell yall it woke me up I couldn't stop dancing in my chair at 7am love this!!!!!
we wrong for this, I hope we know scripture like we know the words to this,
To whom will ye liken me, and make me equal, and compare me, that we may be like? They lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh silver in the balance, and hire a goldsmith; and he maketh it a god: they fall down, yea, they worship. They bear him upon the shoulder, they carry him, and set him in his place, and he standeth; from his place shall he not remove: yea, one shall cry unto him, yet can he not answer, nor save him out of his trouble. Remember this, and shew yourselves men: bring it again to mind, O ye transgressors. Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is none else; I am God, and there is none like me, Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure: Calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man that executeth my counsel from a far country: yea, I have spoken it, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed it, I will also do it. Hearken unto me, ye stouthearted, that are far from righteousness: I bring near my righteousness; it shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not tarry: and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel my glory. (Isaiah 46:5-13)  Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.   (Acts 16:31)
504 for life ! South Louisiana! ❤️❤️❤️ Manny Fresh rules ..BOUNCE BRO 😎💯🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸.. Generation X RULES !
Im high laying in my bathtub it took me until 7:56 to realize the desk wasnt tiny and that there was a desk.

**backing my a** up at my desk** This brilliant! Thanks Tiny Desk💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾
This makes me wanna wobblyyyyyyyyyyy wobblyyyyy drop its like its hot
Mannie looks the same he did like 20 years ago. 😮
400 degreez album is a top 10 hip hop album of all time ....🔥🔥🔥🔥
Now that’s how you do a Tiny Desk‼️‼️‼️
🎉fantastic🎉🙏🙏🙏
If Tiny desk needs Lil Wayne or Busta Rhymes on here!!! Pharrell is another
That was one of the ones I have ever seen man I needed this 😢
This was what the Culture needed!!! Little did we know…. Give my man his flowers 💐🤦🏽‍♀️💐💐💐💐💐💐
Turn me up😝!
🔥🔥🔥
This really made my morning ❤😊
Him and man or really made my childhood unknowingly ❤ love them
Nah ain't no way I would've been in there and not got a write-up for excessive something... dancing, rapping, too much energy. SOMETHING lol!! Not just gonna play some of favorite childhood and HS songs live and I keep it "corporate" smh.   "He kept yelling 'thats my n-word' with tears in his eyes. Is he ok?"
I've watched tiny desk for years and every since Tank and the Bangas, there has been an effort to highlight Black musicians. What's sad is that while tiny desk usually highlights artists that are underground or not well known, the Black artists featured are typically quite huge to the culture. It is so cool that society as a whole is learning more and  also becoming more familiar with where samples today are coming from. I've been introduced to new artists (new to me), Black and others, and that's what I've always loved about tiny desk. Lastly, when a Black person plays tiny desk to clean up on Saturday morning, you know it's a BIG DEAL!!!  Please keep this inclusive staff employed and well paid!! Now, let's start bringing in international artists!! Blitz the Ambassador next!!!
This was EPIC!! go head then Juve and Mannie Fresh! The band was top tier and the singers as well! I loved it ❤❤❤
Ok. Wow. Takes me back 😎
I'm surprised yall let this happen honestly and I love it. This is hood royalty right here. Key pieces of the soundtrack of the late 90s- early 00s. Tiny Desk is revolutionary
Man❗this was CRAZY!
Yooooo, this was very much needed!! I have watched this over & over for 4 days. Every song took me back in time. Juvie & Mannie do it like no other!! 💚💚💚
As An XU Alum, this for all my  Grrttown, Magnolia, Desire, 9th, 8th 7th Ward. “Across The Bridge,”Metairie, “We Never Close,” Cafe Du Monde, The East, Maison Blanche, The Lake Front on Sundays, Whispers, Po Boyz, 2nd lines, Zulu Krew, Claiborne, Tulane, Popeye’s, The Zoo, and of course the French Quarter and Bourbon Street. New Orleans has the best, richest American Culture. Juvenile and Mannie Fresh are true manifestations of the city.
this is all HEEEEEEAAAAAT
N.O stand up 🔥🔥🔥
This concert is 🔥❤️ Admittedly, I listened to Juvenile’s music but wasn’t really a fan. This concert changed my perception! His flow, the musicianship, song arrangements, and entire vibe…🥰🥰🥰
This my 7th time watching this from beginning to end 😂😂😂 just let it play
I think we all telling our ages!  Lol
Best tiny desk ever🔥🔥
This excited us watching as much as it did them laying it down ❤️
As I said on another post, whoever put this in play deserves an award…because this is the “Tiny Desk” that we didn’t know we needed…
This is such a dope concept! I’m enjoying this mini concert so much… great way to pivot and think outside the box.
Man this is dope  af..🎉🎉🎉
❤❤❤
I forgot he has so many hits
Man these songs bring back so many great memories. Give juvenile and Mannie their flowers NOW. 💜💜

This experience made my soul sing. 400 Degreez has been my morning shower song for the last 3 weeks. Gets my energy up without fail. So imagine my delight to see Juve and Mannie put it down on the best Tiny Desk performance ever! Thank you NPR!
Juvie is and always been my favorite, he should've been way bigger but yes he definitely deserves his flowers 💐💐😘🥰❤️🙏🏾🎤🎶🎼🎧🎺🎹

Listen to this performance on 1.25x speed if you want to mix it up.  Still sounds great but with a new flavor
I'M CANADIAN AF🇨🇦BUT ME AND MY BROTHERS WERE F'ING WITH CASH MONEY AND NO LIMIT HARD AF❤ BEAUTIFUL MEMORIES ❤
I can't lie I have listened to this show at least 10 times already.  I loved the fact he called Turk his little brother and showed him love. Take me back to high school and my early 20's
He could have went longer. Legend
YOU KNOW THE TEMPERATURE ❤❤❤❤
IF YOU WERE YOUNG OR OLD ENOUGH TO KNOW HOW BIG THESE BROTHERS ARE, AS FAR AS CULTURE AND SOUTHERN HOP ❤❤❤❤ LEMME TELL YOU. THEY WERE DOPE AF. IMO BIGGER THAN G-UNIT❤❤❤❤MANNIE FRESH WAS HIM. HA.
The Tiny Desk Performance I didn’t know I need.
Mannnn this IS GOLDEN !!!!
I’d download these versions of these juvenile songs and happily pay for the privledge.
THE CROWN WAS LIT!!!!
JUVIE!!!! HOTBOY!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
When a real alpha sings
Awesomeness
Okay, y'all. Aside from the fact that this concert was EVERYTHING, I need to tell y'all that 4 days ago, my ex-roommate and I put our dog down. I asked him to come see me often. If you look behind Juvie, there's a picture of a dog. THAT DOG IS FRANKIE!!! IT LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE HIM!!!! I FUKN LOST IT, in a good way tho! I need to know whose pic that is or who put it up there, cuz I am FLOOOORED right now!! My baby boy came to see me thru the gotdamn Juvie concert! 😂
Yay❤❤❤❤
His voice aged like wine, it's insane to hear such an amazing version of "Slow Motion" after all these years, so good it sounds like a cover.
😂 My favorite verse starts @ 22:19🎉😅
Didn’t know this version of rodeo is exactly what I needed.
🔥
Mike Epps would be the perfect casting if Juvie did a biopic
Juvie! I been a fan since HA in 1998
I love Juve and Mannie Fresh❤
Bravo! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
My favorite is, I'm About To Bounce Back.
🔥🔥🔥🔥💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽

👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
This man is underrated
Still one of my favorite artist from CASH MONEY & Mannie Fresh one of the most underrated beats makers &  producers
This was 🔥 I needed this 😁
This was truly for the CULTURE!! He deserves ALL his flowers. True longevity in his music—that I’m afraid some of these new artist won’t have 20, 30, 50+ years down the road.
When Fresh drops the signature hook. Fresh, fresh, freaky fresh. lol
Mane how do you get to the Tiny Desk audience!? It's been on my to visit list since I moved up here in 2012.
Love this ❤😂 and the faces are priceless
Sometimes Twitter does good
This was amazing
I’m here for 1 song.
Man if y’all don’t know Juvenile y’all betta get hip!!! Classic
Shii was lit. Good to see juve n mannie. Hahaha 😊 them horns hitting yall.
This is organic. Like if they are in the studio.
Beautiful flashback!!
We needed this❤
RODEO for the win!
This is the best tiny desk concert I’ve seen yet! He WORKED that crowd.
This made my heart smile❤
Goat

Thank you 🎉🎉🎉  4th of July was better cause of this!
Straight fire
Straight fiyyyaah 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Classic
Timeless ♥️
Took me back to my childhood.. felt like I been a CMB Hot Boy all my life
Juvie and Mannie's Live natural voice sounds JUST like the recorded album version... Pure Pros
JUVIE took me wayyy back. Wasn’t even supposed to be listening to him😂😂😂 my man’s ain’t missed a beat. Mannie fresh still slap!!
If Juvie never popped with "Ha" , potentially you could of never heard of Lil Wayne
If you listen to the words as an adult I realize we help ruin todays youth. Trash music
Baby I am at work! Between cases(anesthesiologist) surfing YouTube! Came across tiny desk!!! Baby we all thought it was in the 99, early 2000’s!! Remembering life before Adulting!!! 😂
That ish was all the way live!!!!
Manny, with that tambourine looking like a stud in church😅... much love to the musicians! Good seeing Manny after so many years
One of the Best concerts.
Came in 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Hes an awesome entertainer
the band!!!! yesss
I hope this flys and soars... so good!! @tinydeskconcert thank youuuuu
Juvieeeeeee....... yes sir
How old is this crowd 😂 they barely know the songs frfr
Man, they’ve really outdone themselves with this one.  Insanely good.
My heart and soul needed this 🙏🏽💚
I really, truly, thoroughly enjoyed this!
Keep running it up y’all! Let’s get Juvie, Mannie, and the other artists as many views as possible.
That was straight fire!
I done watched this so many times. I remember in Cali all the dudes thought they were part of Cash Money 😂
Dang you used to be able to know what rappers were sayjng
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Man I’m in a world of bliss.. man Cash Money had New Orleans on LOCK 🔒… what a time to be alive ❤
We need Nas on Tiny Desk next!
⚜️❤️🥰

Im so happy to see Mannie Fresh he every producer in this era Daddy.
WE NEEDED IT!!! 🔥❤
I would love to see that live that was dope
Can’t no current boys mess with Juvie Flashback of my teens
Man those instruments make it sound so good. Incredible performance
Is that jidion on brass?😂😂
Mannie Fresh the greatest music creator or our Era hands down without him on every beat it ain't no cash money FACTS
Been a minute✌️
lol on NPR
Rodeo made the whole show
Turning 50 next month...if I was there I would have been reeeeal athletic..❤
NPR: "Yeah, so typically we do about 3 songs or so and call it a day."  Juvenile: "Hollup, let me cook."
He sounds the exact same ❤️❤️
This made me so happy  !! HAPPY 4TH YALL
My boy dranking and feeling good! Artist can’t perform on stages now days like this.

Mannie delivered a classic performance 🎉 this npr experience might rival mtv unplugged…James and Bobby meet juv and mannie ❤ epic.. beat yeah ..call and response yeah .. all time episode
I cannot put into words how amazing this is. It's so beautiful to watch these guys age so gracefully, and to experience what they've given the world again and again. I love hip hop with all my heart!!!

This one takes the top spot!!! Let’s go NPR! Tiny Desk!!

Ten ten ten across the board to juvie, his crew, and production team!
Thank you, Tiny Desk. Juvie The Great.
Tiny desks only encore ever No one has had an encore except for juvenile show the man respect lol
I want to know what Jon Baptiste is looking at... him and Trombone Shorty was litty.  The band was cranking too.  Juvie brought the strings out and all.  This is the livest Tiny Desk ever!
Internet is undefeated. Glad we voted this and Twitter n NPR made it happen 🙌🙏
Me on work rn 🦟 🦗🦟🦗🦟🦗🦟🦗🦟
Songs sound just as good 25yrs later... that's called classics. 504 to 314.
Loved they got great shots of them with the crowd. So much energy in that room. 💯
Had to come back and watch again. ❤❤❤❤❤
This made my day!!!
Yoo much needed ❤
That rodeo & slow motion 🤦🏽‍♂️🔥
Mannie Fresh and CA$H MONEY made some really special music. Seeing performed with a live band like this elevates it to a whole nother level. This is amazing!
Watching this makes me sad that we will never get a DMX Tiny Desk 😢
This is sooo good
I need a fully remastered album JUST LIKE THIS! Lawd I love my city and the art that comes from it 🥹🥹🥹
Yassss!!!! I got my whole undergrad life!
This was by far THE BEST Tiny Desk ever!
There are so many lyrics i could never make out that i can finally hear, live! I love this!
I wish they hired more black people. You rarely see any POC when they flip the camera to the audience
The best thing desk by far!!!! Juvie the great!
This was one of my favs 💪🏾💯
Let me tell ya...I could listen to this every day and never get bored. I always held Usher Tiny Desk as the best but I think Juve done slid to that #1 spot OMG the 90s have come back and I am ecstatic. WELL DONE.
This is that N.O. soul. Hip-hop mixed with Errthang.
I wish I could like this 100 times!
all respect to cash money and their long histroy; He was my favorite artist in highschool.  without a doubt though the best live juvenile performance I've ever seen.  I wouldn't have guessed this would be the venue.
For da 99 n the 2000s
THANK YOU... FOR THE CULTURE!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Man I wish they could have B.G. on that bip. He had the best flow out of the hot boyz
I needed this today! Thanks! 😃
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤😊
That band was hard asf 😂
The strings. The outfits. Mannie Fresh. The golds. I mean…I enjoyed every second and was sad when it was over. My favorite for June by far!!!!
Cash Money Millionaire/Hot Boyz reunion would be epic. Juvi, Birdman, Wayne, Turk, BG(When released) and Mannie
KLC And Mannie Fresh are the two biggest producers cumin from The NO They need to Have A Verzue
Cash Money raised me💯
I watched this bout 10x now… the best one hands down!
LET’S GOOOO JUVI!!!!!!!!
juvenile is soooo fine🥰🥰
Best one let’s get Ma$e next
This is amazing holllyyy jeeez
Never knew I needed this ..this reminds me of being in the lunch room and we would be yelling these lyrics out in 4th grade  lol
Pure dopeness!
Modern classical music for my ears
Epic. Fuxking perfect
Who didnt know the words to all these songs? Impossible. 🔊
Thank you tiny desk! This was amazing! ❤

Is it just me or has Mannie Fresh got that high school math teacher vibe going these days? Like that Teacher you had that you could just tell.... outside of work that wear their pants just a little lower and have their car seat leaned back a bit?
One of the best tiny desk along with Charlie Wilson and migos n 2 chainz
Power!

The Tiny Desk we didn't know we needed.  Why does he still look AND sound the same?  The breath control.
Is this the first tiny desk encore?!?! This is amazing 😭💕⚡️

This is amazing 🥹
This was soooooo dope! One of my favorites! Juve
We need too short too I think that would be so dope
Tears came to my eyes. This crew brought the southern resurgence to mainstream media when they didn't want us there. They weren't the first to do it but they were among the best. Hats off to the Cash Money Crew.
We need too short too I think that would be so dope

After all these years, I never knew that "oh" that kept repeating in the background of Set It Off was Mannie himself.
I was in high school when these guys were hot
I freaking loved this set! Juvenile and Mannie brought back my early  days at the club!
Khaki Suits and Soulja Rags! Classic 99-2000 N.O. attire! Love my HomeTown!!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥⚜️⚜️⚜️⚜️⚜️
The instruments is immaculate. Only thing missing was Wayne part what what what drop it like it’s hot 😂😂
And they say time machines don’t exist.  This took me all the way back to 1999! I was in a club in Deep Elum dancing up a sweat!!
That was 🔥 and Juve never gets old.
Mannie Fresh 🔥❤️
Lots of people in the comments need to search for LL Cool J Unplugged.
It’s for the 99, 2000’s Cash Money was 🔥 Juvi forever a vibe with the live band and Manny Fresh🥰
Encore
Energy
This took me back ❤ Well deserve for Juvi
This makes me smile so hard… the G.O.A.T of my childhood 😊

The clerk wouldnt sell him a bottle of Hen without his ID.  Another customer said, "Gurl thats Juvenilei, you dont know he on fire. He took pictures with us before leaving. A down to earth guy. FYI, He got his drank.

✨Rodeo and Slow motion ✨

Now I got to bump some juvie on the way home
If someone told me Manny Fresh is Whoopi Goldberg's brother, I would believe them. Kinda
I wish he had done Ghetto Children.
Amazing energy loved it
This Tiny Desk was the dopest and having Manny Fresh with Juvenile was even better!
Isn't it mesmerizing how Juvi, with absolute precision, recites every word so effortlessly? I think this live rendition's brilliance lies in the remarkably clear enunciation of lyrics, serving as a compelling testament to his phenomenal lyrical talents. Indeed, Juvi is a virtuoso of verse! Thank you to whoever at Tiny Desk thought of this.
nah this here is lit af
The way the crowd knew what song was coming next and then Juvenile read his audience and said “somebody say!!” and the tiny crowd took over and said “uhhhhhhhhh, I like it like that! She working that back, I don’t how to act!”🥺🥲 love the unison!❤
This is my fourth time coming here rewatching this episode!!!!

This like my 5th time watching the whole performance
First time I heard this,  I completely forgot it was 2023. Literally thought it was 2000 and I was walking thru the school halls with my cd player in my pocket bumping all of the hits from a burnt cd. We need more like this.
🎉🎉🎉
Legend
Legendary 🔥
Man I'm so appreciative of the 90s artists from cash money and no limit  they really made hit after hit and birthed some legends with their influence
on my 3rd watch in 3 days
When I say this took me back to my Undergraduate days at my HBCU-Fayetteville State University and put a grin on my face.  Words cannot even describe the memories that these performers brought back.  Thank you for being the soundtrack of My Life!
Wow!! I really enjoyed this!! Brought me back to the days growing up in New Orleans. I needed this and didn’t ever know it 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
This just made me sooo happy and I’m only 10 seconds in. This man deserved his flowers LONG ago! I still have so many Juvenile songs on my playlists
Epic 😍
All I ask for is a live performance of Ghetto Children... that's it, nothing more
This was literally a Tiny Desk  concert.

Mannie Fresh is SO underrated. Hip hop doesn’t celebrate him enough or mention him with the Dr. Dre’s or Pharrell’s.
Enjoyed every bit!
This is sooo wholesome 😊
🎷🎺🎹🥁🎸🎙🎼
I love juvie
Yassssss❤❤❤❤❤❤
We need a whole album like this !!! True classics
The energy coming off of this performance is just beautiful, I feel good every time I watch it.  Everything about this was beautiful ❤.  To hear these songs performed with live bands touches my 33 year old soul.  I can tell they all enjoyed being there.  Thank you to whoever arranged this.
I enjoyed that way too much. Been a Juvenile fan since Ha.
Smiled for 28 minutes. Much Love from the middle of the boot😊

The Tiny Desk I never knew I needed!!!!! This is EVERYTHING!!!!!
Maaanniie!!!!
The reason cash money made it to mainstream!
Brought me back to 12-13 years old lol I’m 36 now ha came out when I was in 7th grade 😂
I thought I was gonna let this play on the side and get some work done. Absolutely not. Was cutting up the whole time 😂
Mannie Fresh needs his flowers!!!!!!
I really need to see him in concert again!
A brodie,I'm 46 years old. I was about 19 in my 86' Cutlass tearing my trunk and 12s up. You bought back some memories my guy...shed a tear. 😢❤😊
Absolutely epic!!!!!!!!!!!!
I love this so much! Couldn't stop smiling! Great times to Juvie and Cash Money! The band and Manny Fresh are phenomenal. ❤
2199 they still going to play this lol
A mafuckin legend for real !  Started off so perfect. It’s really insane how many bangers he has !  This one of the smoothest ones by far  Shout to Mannie & the band !  The energy was beautiful ! Great job, Tiny Desk !

Juvie still got it and the fountain of youth ❤

Love you Juvie!
36 years old holding my napping baby daughter, jamming this with my earbuds in. Man that took me back... I think that was my favorite tiny desk concert, and there have been some great ones.
This is by far my favorite Tiny Desk!!!! Juvy & Manny Fresh never disappoint!!🎉
This was far most lit tiny desk session created!!! Let's go Juvie!! His album is definitely back in rotation!! I wish this version was sold too in full versions!!
My favorite Tiny Desk!!🔥🔥❤️
I didnt realize I needed this ...
🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️
This setting makes all music better. Album tracks can feel over produced. Tiny Desk and similar venues always sound wonderfully natural.
How has Juvis voice not aged after so many years?!? Incredible Tiny Desk Performance.   Mannie Fresh, you are incredibly talented even after all of these years! 👏🏼👏🏼 Props to the Cash Money family 🙌🏼 You have your people in the South feeling SO proud! ❤️  Omg! I just saw the encore performance 😂😂 Had to come back and edit my comment! Heck yeaaaa 🙌🏼😂🤣  Only critique I have is you should sell tickets to watch these performances LOL!
This performance off the chain juve sounds just like his cds 🔥🔥🔥💯
I know it wasn't happening but if he had wayne for some songs like project chick woulda been epic
How y’all gon tease us with the beginnings of “Nolia Clap” and “Go DJ” and not do the song???
Got chills 🥶 when Juvi said “Ugghh, I like it dat!! ✅🆙. Big fan of Tiny Desk and the quality of Past, Present and Upcoming talent it brings out . Shoutouts to the legend Mannie  Fresh and the entire musical cast 🎧🔁🔥🔥🔥
I’m so proud…. I need to see this live
You understand ❤
I loved this. I felt 19 again.. & manny fresh gave me my Lyfe 😂
Amazing! Receive your flowers, Juvie. Well deserved!! ❤
Ohhh weee,  I didnt even know i needed that "project chick" acoustic version
The greatest tiny desk concert !
Yo he kiiiiilled this!!! 🔥 🔥 🔥
After watching this I feel like I looked in the mirror and my young self smiling back at me.
This is the Tiny Desk I didn't know I needed until I saw it! This man is STILL sexy asf!
This made my whole day!
Juve the GREAT
One the best Tiny Desk Concerts EVER !!!!
This is the best introduction to an artist i have experienced in recent memory. Thank you so very much
LOUISIANA IN THIS BIH YA HEARD ME

Thanks for acknowledging their contribution & providing Juvy & Mannie their flowers while they can smell them. The smiles on their face is priceless. This was awesome!!   NPR please continue to showcase Black musicians all year, on a regular, & not just for Black music month. Thank you NPR!!
Bro really had a Tahitian treat in a can!
If this doesn’t put a smile on your face idk what will
This is corny af
This performance was nothing short of spectacular.
Juvie Da Great💪🏾
If this dropped on cassette or vinyl... I’d buy it in a second. No lies.
The Encore Had Me Smiling 😁😍🥹
OUTSTANDING 👏🏽 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Only in Nola.....home of jazz....Mannie mix Brass and Juvy
Why did manny fresh stop producing music?
maybe the best tiny desk ever....
DOPE !

My mothfuckin boyz❤❤❤ great show
❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
✅💯
i’m just now realizing “Project B*tch” has a very similar melody to “Will You Be There?” by Michael Jackson.   “Carry me Like you are my brother Love me like a mother Will you be there?”  now sing  “Give me a project b****,  give me a hoodrat chick one that don’t give a ****” 😂
This is absolutely one of the best Tiny Desk I seen!!!!…Adding them strings was a boss move ♥️♥️♥️♥️
Yesssssssssss! The tiny Desk Episode I never knew I needed! 💛🎶🎵 This took me BYKE!
This was sooooooo goooooodt! Whew.....I can't stop grinning. JUVIE!!!!!!!

That ENCORE was everything I needed this Tiny Desk Concert this one took me back great job Juvie, Mannie and the crew
Best Tiny Dest Performance 🔥🔥
💥💥💥💯
Hands down the best tiny desk concert yet!!!
Whoever decides on who performs should have been given a raise for this decision
He refuses to let the camouflage doo rag go. Im here for it. Mani Fresh still look like my butch aunt
This is the best tiny desk I’ve ever seen.
Love me some Juvenile!!!! Much needed since I wasn’t able to make Essences this year❤
Ayeee 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Mannie Fresh is in his element, happy for him!!!
I love that guy yessssss
first of all, I'm crying. This was absolutely fantastic!!!!  let’s take a moment to shout out one of many unseen heroes here: the NPR social media person. They saw the tweets and insisted the higher ups know this was a community need. i see you!! thank you!!!
This was perfect
New Orleans very own. Magnolia legend
I’m on a plane listening to this and it’s got me lit 😂
Tough 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
musician credit on percussion who left at 09:42?? :(
🔥🔥🔥💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾🫡🫡🫡
Juvie know he fine 🥰😅🙌🏿
Yea Juve da great 🙌🏽
Juvi and manie we need an album
Why was I in my car just clapping?! 🤣 As a HS graduate c/o 2000, this was my era as I headed off to The Florida Agricultural & Mechanical University!  🧡🐍🧡
He's drinking his Juvie Juice btw
I can’t believe how incredible this was. Mannie Fresh playing on it was just the icing. *Chef’s kiss*
Oooo my god I love me some Juvenile music!!
That was a well enjoyed use of 28 mins of My day today. The World needed that.
This was probably the most harmonious elegantly ratchet thing I’ve seen in a long time. They seriously could not have gotten a better group of people together for this, such a perfect vibe. The instruments really did compliment Juve's grimey and gritty rap lyrics which were mind-blowing. What I love most about this, is the way NOLA culture was showcased here. I think this might be my favorite Tiny Desk performance of all time.
the joy I am experiencing while watching this!  thank you NPR for having the culture on here and not dimming it down!!!
JUVIE THE GREAT!!!!! MANNY FRE FRE FRE FRE FRESH!
"greatest love story ever told" 😄
This will be on repeat. Especially during the holidays.
how can i like this more than once?
🔥🔥🔥
Wale & Juve the best are in the number one spots for me
I’m all smiles from beginning, middle to the end😊
This was my high year's!!!!!!!
I'm 27 and I remember my mom and aunt listening to these songs on replay
Best video I've watched in a long time. Juvenile is a national treasure!
So beautiful
❤❤❤❤ Nor' Leans foreva baby

DOPE!!!
I haven’t come to the channel in a while. This definitely did it for me. Fire.
I cannot stop watching this!
I needed this in my life!!!
400 Degreez what a moment in time!
🔥🔥🔥🔥
the guy with the lil shaker during slow motion 😄
Ayyyyeeeeee 99 and the 2000
I had some low expectations with this and boy was I wrong. Awesome  performance!!!! They still gots it!!!
This gave me life I didn’t know I needed.
I didn't realize I needed this in my life
The thing i love about this is Juvenile initially didnt know what Tiny desk was and was gonna pass, but someone smart in his camp was like "Naw ....you need to do this"....then 10k retweets later and here we are.  Love that Juvenile got his second wind. This was a win for the culture
Is this something normal NPR does?
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Just put the whole  crowd  in a music  video  with mannie fresh an juvenile
One more time!!!
⚜️⚜️⚜️⚜️⚜️⚜️⚜️⚜️ It’s a Louisiana thang ⚜️⚜️⚜️⚜️⚜️⚜️⚜️⚜️

I love you Juve... Miss this kinda music.
Juvenile 🖤⚜️🖤⚜️This was took me back to high school and college like it was yesterday.
They’re not hyped enough for meeee. We need some 80s babies in the building.
I remember how frustrated i would get when i would try to listen to this album and my cd player would skip. I would be all in and then we hit a bump in the road and it would skip i hated that. But the album was 🔥 for sure. Nice to hear it with the instruments sounds real good.
My fourth time watching this video 🔥 anyone know what he is drinking?
Never watched an entire Tiny Desk until today. I love Juvie mane… this was epic 🔥
Killed it!!!!! Encore
The concert I didn't know I needed 😅
JUVE THE GREAT!!!🎯🎯❤️❤️❤️
This was sooo good
That TURK verse was so needed! ❤
This was fire 🔥! Had me rapping from the beginning to the end ❤ I’m a big cash money fan plus I love that juvenile had mannie fresh with him. ❤
Can we all just appreciate the fact that after 25 years Juvenile hasn’t aged a day
Loving this! Lets Go!
Greatest 30mins of my life🔥🔥🔥

This was SICK. I haven't heard some of these songs in years and it all came flooding back to me. What an awesome performance!
I keep repeating "Slow Motion" in this performance! The crowd, live instruments, and all the reactions of the musicians when they hear the crowd getting into was just a whole vibe!
I am digging this whole vibe!
Tiny desk been lit… This solidified it…
LOUISVILLE IN HERE AND STL STAND UP!!!

Fantastic
That's my Juve ya heard me!!!
This is 😫😫😫 🔥🔥🔥‼️‼️‼️  As a millennial, who was raised during the 99s & the 2000s; CASH MONEY RECORDS took over The Tiny Desk like only they could!   ...back when drill/rap showed us a good time...& not outlining m.u.rd.3.r plots and bragging about unaliving everybody on O P Q R S T block & acting a plum f00l!
This is so good to see ❤
Omg this performance was amazing!
This arrangement by far is the best EVER! Like better than any artist I’ve ever seen ! He needs to travel with this band
He sounds even better than he did when he started!!!
This was music from my prime CD playing era!!! 17/18 years old in ‘99! I would’ve been there singing all the lyrics!
This is great!
i need a cash money /hot boyz/ big tymerz tour
I probably haven't heard these songs since they came out and still recall every, single word !
THIS WAS SOOOO GOOOOD!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽 Live instrumentation was everything! If Juvie ever takes this on tour better believe I'll be there!!!!
That was 25 well spent minutes
This was 🔥
This was 🔥
That jazzy/acoustic rendition of Rodeo was EV.E.RY. THING 🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This beats Usher & takes #1! 😜 I’ve watched this to many times!
Thanks. We prefer older artists' concerts. They need a place and we do too to listen to great music. Time travel
Never had I heel toed, twerked and cried tears of joy at the same time! This was a moment 🔥🔥🔥
Four decimals share and party's

Being 33 growing up in Orlando and listening to juvy and after Katrina getting all the folks from the boot really taught us a lot about the Louisiana culture 🤟🏾
Jesus Christ!!! That was amazing! I haven’t smiled this hard in a very long time.

I think this is easily my favorite to date!! Juve is my husband in my head. So nostalgic!!
I was legit like 10/11 yrs in Houston watching Cash Money Records rise up on tv and BET. Lil Wayne was my favorite bc he was the baby of the group..but we all know when Juve came on, he took over!! Thank you NPR! We needed this one
Them accents have in a chokehold😂😂😂😍😍😍😍
Yall I'm almost in tears behind this one. Just the memories of where i was and who i was with. The soul needed this one. The masses needed this one.
When we used to write *Bling Bling* on everything ❤️

Anybody still saying HIP HOP is not real music is just a hater. This was enjoyable from start to finish!
Love it 😍
I wish I could LIKE this twice. ❤
I am loving these tiny desk concerts!!!  I feel sorry for these youngsters that never got a chance to experience these masterpieces first hand!!!  I can't stop smiling!! Juvie and Mannie Fresh did their thang with this one!!

I was today old when I found out Mannie Fresh did his background sounds no protools

Impressed! Wow! Very nice. I could have done w out the digital voice over thingy. But very very nice.
Bringing back my college days!!!!
Juvie and Mannie with a live band. This is what we needed!

My very first concert was the Cash Money and Ruff Ryders tour. I was a whole preteen. I couldn’t believe my father let me go. This brought back so many memories. Loved this!!!!!!
Juve brought a whole post credit scene to NPR! This took me back to middle school.

All right. I really dig this. Juvenile and Mannie Fresh with a real deal New Orleans jazz band. It don't get much better than this
This brings me back to going to xula and partyin in NOLA and life after Katrina and going out in philly during my Drexel days. If any of Juvies songs came on folks went bananas.this was so nostalgic to watch and the band was killin
I love my East Coast/ Wu Tang hits…but Juve is LEGIT!!! on my list. Me and my wife constantly got a Juve hit coming out our mouth!
Woow 🎉🎉🎉
Best tiny desk I’ve seen
real music will always last forever 🫡
This has to be the classiest, most sophisti-ratchet hip hop/rap performance I have ever seen.😆 Juve put Nola on the MAP! I'm glad he had this platform to shine. "Hit after HIT!"
Great performance and Musicians 🌍🌍🥳
Project Pat us next, please! 💫
HARDDDDDD!!!!!.... YESTERDAY'S PRICE IS DEFINITELY NOT TODAY'S PRICE AFTER THIS ....💯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
If I was there….. IF I WAS THERE!!!!! If I Was There!!

This Tiny Desk concert concept is genius.  Manny.., still sick wit it. Mr officer, Mr officer.., get these muthafuckin’ cuffs off-of-us.

Cash money y'all. Give the band to Mannie to juvie their flowers. A remix and a different spins on classics
This made me so happy . Being from New Orleans these songs was everything growing up glad yo see the legends alive and well still doing they thing🥰🥰
This was not on my bingo card!!!! This rendition of “Back That A$$ Up” was so beautiful it brought me to near tears! My middle school self is too geeked right now!
Man... This man had some heat.. From a dude clubbin in the 90s and early 2000s, this brought back memories!! These dudes made some fantastic music that's absolutely timeless. Amazing session. 🔥
The band, They did they jobbb !!🤩 Juvie & mannie never fail to make me proud 🥹🫶🏽

I went behind my parents back to buy 400 Degrees when I was in the 6th grade and I asked my parents if I could paint the cash money dolla sign in my bedroom. Juvie had this white kid from the minnesota suburbs thinking he was from magnolia. Loved this concert and brought back some hilarious memories from days gone by.
This was everything 🔥🔥🔥 just what I needed I swear ❤️❤️❤️ this was truly the best one by far thank you so much tiny desk and NPR this was just what the world needed a reminder of the good days when music was actually good 🎶🎶 well done 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾

I smiled from beginning to end!!!
I love this
Hey brought my childhood back with this one!!!!! WAY TO GO NPR AND TINY DESK
That performance was 🔥 🔥-one of my top 4 favorites…charlie Wilson, too short and George Clinton are the other 3! The look on Jon Batiste playing a few cuts is priceless-he was having a great time and found the lyrics funny…same with trombone shorty! A lot of energy and audience participation!
It’s lit 🔥🔥🔥
Dope 🔥🔥🔥
Encore! Encore! Encore! Yesssss!
This probably top 3 if not the best one
The brotherhood of Juvie and Mannie Fresh after all these years is what touches me most. They've contributed so much to the culture and they deserve the recognition.   🗣GIVE THEM THEIR FLOWERS! 💐❤️🎉
That was fantastic! Juve!!  Go DJ!!!
Straight fire

I moved back to New Orleans when I was 12 the year 400 Degrees was released.  My Aunt bought me this CD like my welcome back to New Orleans gift.  I had to sneak and listen to it memories.
Let me tell ya, this is the tiny desk concert I didn’t kno I needed! To have him doing his hits with a band and in a different style is so refreshing.. and some of the way he did his hits he should rerelease in this style… I must say this one of the best tiny desk concert so far!!!
Greatest Tiny Desk EVER!!!! 😮‍💨👏🏾🔥
This was so fire 🔥 !!!
Timeless hits
Real talk, Juve could’ve did the whole 400 Degreez album and nobody would’ve been mad.  Legendary concert, much love from St. Louis
IMO, THIS is the epitome of what a Tiny Desk session should be (Exceptional artists/musicians, strings, horns, drums, background vocals, crunk audience AND all the feels it provided for us, the viewing audience). This is one for the records! Great job, NPR/Tiny Desk!!!
This is classic!!! 🗣️CLASSIC!!!!
One time for the 99 and 2000🎉🎉❤❤❤
This was 🔥🔥🔥
I cannot believe they did project bi$!@t on tiny desk 🤣🤣🤣
Juvie the Great!! My Top 3 Tiny Desk. Also the keyboard guy is fine asf
The post credit scene was a whole vibe!
Yeah.....juvenile just reminded me of why my knees hardly work now at 38 years old. Bring me my 15y/o knees from "99-2000s
Absolutely amazing! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Juve The Great You UNDERSTAND 🎤
This had me smiling ear to ear…brought back so many memories as a 41 year old man from Lake Charles, La
Best time desk ever❤
He look good asffff
NICE !!!!!❤❤❤❤
If you didn't shake sumn during this TDC, you just don't know how to shake 😅 💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾
The performance was Legendary! Two of the greatest to ever do it 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I wish was longer
Love Juvie and Mannie Fresh
Yes sir💯
I really enjoyed this
🥳🥳🥳
I’m 45 y/o and this took me all the way back to my youthful college days back in the late 90’s!!  Absolutely loved this entire performance and that Slow Motion rendition was straight bananas!!  I would wear out an entire Juve Essentials playlist performed in this live Tiny Desk style…hats off to both NPR and Juve’s camp for pulling this together!
10:05 thank me later best rendition of Rodeo ever ‼️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Juvenile looks like Cuba Gooding Jr. hehe.
I'm out of breath.
And to think Mannie Fresh created every track! No sampling!!🤩 Love the Gen X energy!! We know how to party!
legendary❤️💯🫡
Great. Loved every min of it was hoping he did "I got that fire".
Probably one of the best Tiny Desks performances!! 🔥🔥
Now do lil wayne!!
Juvie my guy loved this 🔥💪🏾😎
He has ascended to a new level of greatness if thats even possible , im 37 grew on listening to Juve and Cash Money this was dope and 🔥
Certain music shouldn't be played live. Much respect to the OG Juvie tho 💪🏾👊🏾

This is by far the Best episode of tiny desk I’ve encountered.
What a phenomenal performance by Juvie! This is the most classy hood thing I have ever witnessed!

I'm so happy!😊
This was incredible !! Amazing 👏🏾 really appreciated this 🙏🏿
This might be the best tiny desk ever. And trust me, there have been classics before him but this right here was the peak of hip-hop/Rap. The true golden era and it take me back to my late teens and early twenties. Best times of our lives. They say songs don’t bring back memories but feelings and this is a prime example.
HottBoyz
This was the one!!!!
Start aiming this direction if you want more views just like the Mac Miller classic…rap is it!
I’m from Louisiana so this was everything for me.
Juve the Great!
Love how he kept is all New Orlean
This is so HARD🔥
Best Tiny Desk yet

This is the BEST ONE THUS FAR!!
fire🎷🎺🎻📯
The best intro of All time
I'm at the house rapping every word and every ad library to every song. Soulja had me up there. I would've been so live... Probably grabbed the mike and Soulja Slim's part and Turk part as well.
I just saw Juvenile in Detriot a few weeks ago! He had the crowd going crazy after the comedy show!!!
Twice as nice!!! I love Juvie for showing out giving the crowd what they asked for!!!!!!❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥.... shout out to the strings, did they know what they signed up for??🤷🏽‍♀️🤎🖤🤍🙉🙊🙈
Still fine!
My new favorite concert 🔥
That crowd was too young. This was for the late 30's to late 40's crowd fa sho.
And this is Diversity ladies and gentlemen the way the world is  Rap is across all culture. We keeping diversity no matter what they say. 👍
This might be one of my fave tiny Desk
It's always to live talent. Brother playing instruments 😊

Everything was on point with the the flow, band and the vibes 🔥🔥🔥

Manny a whole vibe💪🏾🔥& JUVE THE GREAT!❤️
Back again to watch for the 3rd time! Thank you NPR! 🎉😂
Oh juve cussing cussing 😂😂
Having mannie orchestrate for him is the icing on the cake.
I’m going to go ahead and say it….this was the best one by far! Argue with your Mama!!! 😂😂😂 I don’t care, I said what I said! The energy was crazy! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is the best one yet. Got a tear or two, this was amazing. Good to see them doing well, enjoying music, having good times. Well done Tiny Desk Concert.
❤❤ vibing ❤❤
Juvy is still the Great‼️His vocals hasn’t changed ‼️I love everything about this LIVE SESSION ❤️🔥
This has a good blend of elements…hood, elegance & ratchetness… I guess I didn’t realize how explicit some of the lyrics were. Juvenile is a good story teller. He told his story in his lyrics so I guess if you’re listening to his content you must respect it or be jammin to it… the band playing the instruments really took this music to the next level. Juvenile still looks pretty good. He’s spiritually lit & that’s what’s given his career longevity. He’s able to perform these same songs from the 99 & the 2000s and everyone still turns up to them like it’s the first time they’ve heard it. I enjoyed this. I don’t think it can be topped. I think they should do Devin The Dude next.
I’ve been saying Juve is one of my favorite rappers for yearsss!! I think I need a job at tiny desk, I know how to pick ‘em! This was so fun, nostalgic, and ever relevant.
Wow NPR finally produced a piece of content worth listening to.
This is absolutely legendary, one of the best live performances to ever exist, this needs to be in a mueseum somewhere so that the future can remember it for years to come!
🔥 ❤ JUVIE ROCKS 🔥❤
Timeless vibes🔥🔥👏 These gentlemen deserve their flowers 💐💐 Smiling big n singing along 😁
?
he looks so handsome hasn’t aged much at all 😍😍🥰🥰❤❤
juvenile’s price just went up
This was Amazing. I would have paid to see this. Good Job! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
He was the best hotboy hands down
I feel like I missed the best one. Energy ❤️
this is phenomenal. maybe one of my new favorite tiny desks. definitely coming back to this one 💚
I love how he gave love to Hotboi Turk
Please do Busta bust next!
Whaaaaaattttttttt
I woulda lost my job that day because the 99 and 2000's me would have definitely appeared.
👑🙌🏼🙌🏼❤️
This so beautiful man 😢
Excuse me..Mr .Guitarist directly behind Juvenile. Hmm Mr Sir
At 10:00 is when Rodeo comes on ❤
Manny Fresh is so underrated, not even from New Orleans but he brought that bounce sound to the world , no cap.
🔥🔥🔥👌🏽🤌🏽
Rodeo sounds so appropriate 😂😂
I loved everything about this Tiny Desk!!
I ain't gone hold you i watched this like 8 times since it's dropped... This joint was Flawless!!!!
I love this
My boy cutting up
Idk how many 2023 rappers could put on a show like that sheeesh
Remind me of the go go!  Need more of this
Rodeo underrated!!!
Absolutely incredible.
This made me cry a little bit and I’m not sure why 😂
They definitely didn’t film in the South!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣 We woulda had that room rocking, verse after verse!!!!!
Lets just take some time right now to give the band a standing ovation. 🔥🔥🔥🗣🗣🗣
I remember being in high school when this came out. I disregarded it for months because I was into NY rap and I assumed it was some more southern, no lyrics garbage. That next summer I told my friend I had not listened to it. He sat me down for a listening session and I was BLOWN AWAY. 400 degrees is a Bona-fide classic.
This is what I needed!! I will be playing this all week at the work station 😂😂😂😂😂😂
So wonderful!
I came across this and I’m soooooooooo glad that I did, MY FAV TWO NOLA BABIES, JUVIE N MANNY, LUV THOSE TWO! 💋🤎🤎
❤
This is the best tiny desk hands down
One of the best Tiny Desk performances I've seen people sleep on Juvenile he is New Orleans and Mannie Fresh!! Cash Money baby
I think it’s so effortless for them because they like making music and had a good time making it. 🎶💪🏾
All i did was smile from ear to ear as soon as I heard that voice! Nice to hear you again brother!
This was hotttttt boy
Man the live instruments are fire!
Absolutely loved this! The joy, the vibe, the music, the laughter…all of it brought a much-needed smile to my face. Thank you!
😂👏🏽👏🏽💐💐
Man that slow motion was going crazy!!
REAL DOWN SOUTH LEGEND. S/O JUVIE💯
Stretch them glutes!
1.6 million views in 2 days!
Juvie you did the culture well! Thank you!🙌🏾❤️
This was EVERYTHING
Band is crankin sum serious
1st I wanna taste the juvie juice and I never knew that we needed this so badly!!! Enjoyeeed them so much! Childhood activated 😆❤️
This is so classic and I still listen to this cd on stream very often❤💐💐🔥🔥
Why they causing on NPR? Its dumb…they can substitute the bad words with something else
Definitely crazy good,was hoping he would did SUMTHIN GOTTA SHAKE tho
Best tiny desk so far
Mane ppl sleep on Juvie, I been fw him🎶
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Slow motion was a VIBEEEEEEE ! 🗣️ 🤌🏾🤌🏾🤌🏾

If u don't come to tha city Compton
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

This was dirty good.
Essence Fest 2023 missed out! This set woulda been nice on the big stage!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The culture of new Orleans music makes this one of the best performances, because the instruments are just so natural with juvie flow
Real ninjas 🔥 real rap 🔥  no mumbling 🔥 straight fire 🔥
Super dope. 🔥🔥🔥🔥❤🔥
It's the burp for me😅🤣😂
This Generation X-er just got HER WHOLE LIFE!!!! THIS WAS EVERYTHING I needed and most definitely everything I didn't know I wanted. Juvenile kept it trill (an X-er term), and added some strings, some horns, and an upside down harmonica keyboard thingy that sounded like a trombone AND A CELLO, for some extra razzle dazzle. Happy Fourth of Freakin' July!!!
If u wasn't riding through potholes u wouldn't understand
Mannnnnnn juveeee toooorrrreeeee the tiny desk uppppp
When they walked in with them Violins tho!!!!!!
Yessss 🔥🔥🔥
A DMX tiny desk would’ve been🔥🔥🔥🔥
Legendary af
I legit listened twice cause this was DOPE💎💎💎
This took me right back to my late teens early 20’s dancing in the club! One of the best Tiny Desk performances!!
Ayeeee we need a Juvy concert, cash money , big timers, hot boys all that
I walk with a limp cuz my nuts heavy ......
I appreciate his lyrics not being censored!!!
Yes sir
You got tha bloc on fire remainin a G till tha moment u expire
Rodeo was 🔥🔥🔥
I remember cutting out the order from and ordered the 400 Degrees Album from Source magazine back in the day memories
I really like this older wiser Juvenile, it's got a little more soul.
This was so pure! 🤩❤🤩 They created this music over 20 years ago and perform it with the same joy they give their listeners.
On repeat!
Early signs suggest this might be the best one yet...
Da 99 & Da 2000❤❤❤❤
The Tiny Desk we always knew we need!!! Juve the Great!!
This was great!
Black music is the music of the renaissance
Yesssss 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥
Might be the best tiny desk we ever seen
There needs to be an ENTIRE Cash Money tour and guarantee a sold out event. I’m going to at least 3 shows
This is probably the grooviest TDC I’ve seen to date! Love me some Juve 🙌🏽 I zoned out to every song! This was a whole vibe! I’ll forever love me some Terius Gray 🥰💜
Straight.... FIRE🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Juve and Mannie Fresh plus the live band ⚜️👏🏽

HE WAS 1 OF THE GREAT🎶📝 ~BEST DAT"  EVER TOUCH 🎤A MIC. . BUT' ALOT' OF PEOPLE HATE ON EACH OTHER'S WHERE, WE FROM IN NEW ORLEANS  L.A
I’ve never been so happy and teary eyed at the same time. This felt like yesterday. Those 20 years flew by. The south really did that.
Juvie would be great for Versuz if they come back. I know 10 classic ones from him I’m thinking of right now
Strings, horns, base 🎻 🎷🥁🎸 Whew!!!❤😊 🎼 🎵 🎶 🎹 💃🏾 🕺🏿
So who are the two grammy winners?
Juvenile needed this. Good job

Just hit 2 days. Compare the views to other tds 👏🏽
Classic Tiny Desk
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
The background singers ❤
This is definitely in my top 5 favorite tiny desk performances🔥
🔥 🔥
We needed this! 🙌🏽🙌🏽 A new flair! Rawness & uncut!  The real instruments on BTAU made that song hit different! 😮‍💨 They even got down with the audience! I don’t think I’ve ever seen that before! This was nothing less than a tiny desk concert, the N.O. way! ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
they had the wrong audience for this tiny desk, juvie and manie are legends they deserved a hyper audience than these folks.
🔥
This is sooo good I didn’t think want it to end...memories
Manie fresh was the reason I started making beats and wanted to be a producer ❤
That Rodeo was 🔥 breath control with every song and everything! Live performances really show u if u got it or not! 👏🏿
Mannie Fresh looks like he been waiting on this moment his whole life and I love it for them. ❤️❤️❤️
PUT SOME RESPECT ON HIS NAME 🔥
I WISH THERE WAS A CROWD CAMERA..I BET THERES SOME HILARIOUS FOLK IN ALL THESE HIP HOP/RNB TINY DESKS 🕺 😂
This was one of thee best tiny desk concerts hands down🙌🙌

Aye!
Manny Fresh's signature dance is classsic, this whole set was special. Thanks Tiny Desk😊

As a kid I was like 5-6 listen to hot boys mannie and Juvenile this definitely took me back to my childhood I had no business listening to this but I’m glad pops didn’t care
Got my living room live
Yesssssss 💃
I absolutely loved it! I love NPR Music providing diverse representation of black music...Louisiana!
Too much sauce killed it
400 degreez is still the greatest rap album ever made, you can put in an let it ride!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Another reason to thank God i survived to this day! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Killed it!! Legendary 🔥🔥
One of the best tiny desk ever❤️❤️❤️
That version of Rodeo was unreal 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
16 year old me is so geeked right now! Never in a million years would I think this would happen but I'm so happy it did!!
Omgggggggg yesssss 🙌🏾!!!! Juviiiiiii!!!! They need a raise for this one ☝🏾!!!!
For the 9,9 and the 2000
the real juvi, great show
Bruh can’t even describe how much joy this brought to me 🖤. Was getting lit in the living room 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 the best tiny desk 🙌🏾
Tiny Desk never ceases to outdo itself 💪🏾🔥🔥
I am 45 and this brought back such a great time in rap music.
This was so good
I’ve watched this so many times it’s 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Heat
Mannie fresh is the real hero here. I love J but Mannie made all these beats for these songs. Yall got to but respect on my boy name
The best one hands down 🔥🔥🤝🏾
OMG the producer,sound engineers, from the team at @NPR need a raise!! The concert we didn’t even know we needed!!!!  I literally am about to apply to work at NPR cus this is too lit!!!
That “after credits scene” was better than any Marvel after credits scene. I just subscribed to y’all because this was something I didn’t even know I needed.
too good!!
Dopest shid ever!!! Great performance!!!
This made me smile 😁
That's 1 of the best Tiny Desk concerts I have seen! The energy,  the talented musicians, the EN-ER-GY  and the fun the whole gang was having, Juvenile brought it all!
Yes!!! The Tiny Desk we didn’t know we needed!!!
Next Ying Yang Twinz
NOLA 🙌🏾💯💥💜💛 Thanks Juvie and Mannie!
For real, I’m loving it! Juvy!
He is so fine bruh
7th time watching this. 😊Producer: Bobby Carter,  Director: Joshua Bryant both need raises. NPR also should hire the lady that said " one more time" to their PR/ Marketing Dept!
This made my life so much better. Thank you everyone for making that happen. I don’t use the word epic, but that was it. 400 degrees and then some.
this made me smile!!!!!! loved it!!!
I don't care what anyone says, Manny Fresh is somebody's auntie 🤣😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😂
One my favorite Tiny Desk sets I've seen in years. Juvenile had everyone vibing!!
This is the best version of “giving someone their flowers.” Folks tend to look over Juvie, Mannie and Cash Money’s contributions to hip hop history. These boys changed the game and brought the fun back to hip hop at a period when it had gotten way too serious. Hits, hits, hits!!! They ran the game for a while. Thank you N.P.R. for this.
I keep playing this session in my car 🚗, the musicianship is Top Notch
When I tell youuuu I would’ve been cutting up in the front of that audience. Boi, Juvie nd Fresh did their thanG!⚜️💜💚💛⚜️

To everyone involved: Thank Ü for THIS!!!
Thank you for this.
Remember when we were kids/teens growing up in the 80's and 90's and it was comical to see people pushing 50 rapping. Remember when baby boomers used to mock rap and we would laugh. Now in 2023 we're their old ages still rapping.
True NO Soldiers I’d like Too See The Whole Group Hot Boyz🔥🔥🔥

This was beautiful. Like, honestly

Fire, Fiiiiii!!!

Great set. I hope to see You Juvenile in Zurich, Switzerland :)
I still listen to juvenile to this day. Dude was a poet  his delivery was like no other. And manny fresh is legendary 🐐🐐💯

What a waste of Jon batiste and trombone shorty’s time lol
In the history of clubs. 400 degreez is the "only song" the DJ would play back to back. The crunkest 8 min timespan in a club to 1 song.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Crazy he still raps with that hunger and ferocity 🙏🏾🙏🏾
We used so many of Juve songs for the Battle of bands, even to this day!! This definitely one for the culture ❤
You may play this multiple times  during the week to get throughout your day
🔥 🔥 🔥 😊
one of the best at the desk
Juve the great still great 👍
Wow 😮
This was the BEST CONCERT TO END JUNE 2023🎉🎉🎉🎉

💥💥🇩🇴🇩🇴
🔥
Let’s go
So much talent from the 504!!
Bruh 🤯 this was amazing
I went through so many emotions watching this I’m only 33 and I really just want to go back ❤ loved this
JUVE THE GREAT!!!!
I’m ctfu because I know all these songs word for word smh I’m also ctfu because the music is so classy but the WORDSSSSS!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Trust me you don't want to know my lyrics to bling bling hook 😆

LIFE ❤
Jon Baptiste though.  Lol this was amazing but his face was priceless for me.  I'm a huge fan of both but this brought out some great memories and living room dancing
This makes me so MF happy
An hour long Tiny Desk of 400 Degreez with everyone involved once BG is free would be absolutely amazing. If they tour the album in 5 years for the 30yr I would pay a hefty penny to see that happen
Who else had an encore???? ICON!!!! Brother on the guitar had his eye on somebody in that corner! Jk! 🔥🔥
I never thought I'd see jevuline on Tiny desk!!💪 👽🧊🧊🧊
Got my ENTIRE life together right here !!!!!
juve the great(est) ✨

And they dropped it during ESSENCE FESTIVAL 🔥 ❤
This is so Fabulous!!!❤❤❤
I legit got tears in my eyes when they started with the 400 Degreez intro. This was the first cd I bought with my own cash. I still have that same disc. I listened to this album constantly just going thru life’s turbulent motions so it helped me get thru what a youngster would consider “tough times”😂.   I say all that to say, life was a lil simpler then and this concert really took me back. This album is still in my rotation 20 something years later. It aged like wine. Thank you Juvenile, Mannie Fresh, the band, the singers and NPR.
The TINY DESK I didn't know I needed.
🔥 🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
LOUISIANA BABY 🥰
This was the best Tiny Desk ever made! Juvenile and Mannie Fresh made full rap songs be orchestra power houses! Nobody would've thought the rap songs Juvenile made would sound like what he made on Tiny Desk.  You can tell Juvenile care about how his music sound because of the order he put the songs and who he had to come and help him do the songs! People need not to sleep on Juvenile again! He is smart and he have talent! Black people do the best music! Remember that!
Soooooo good🔥🔥🔥
Go Juvie, he did his thing. He got Jean B…🔥🔥🔥

I’m 53, so I grew up on HIP HOP, came from SUGARHILL game, LL, ROXANNE SHANTE, GRANDMASTER FLASH, SALT/ Pepa!MC LYTE
As a black women who was a black  pre-teen  growing up in New Orleans in the late 90s seeing all dis greatness from the origins till now it warms  my heart ..... rep the 504  Juvie and Mannie ! . I remember  teen summits from Q93, Wild Wayne's 9 o clock props  waiting for our  favorite  cash money song to come on, second lines near  by the Claiborne , this was the sound track to our lives! This warms my  heart like the smell  of a good Crawfish boil or  a bowl of  file' gumbo!
This Tiny Desk performance was 🔥… the energy, the flow and they came out from behind the desk. Glad y’all made this happen!!!

Such a nostalgic pleasure to enjoy. Their smiles and energy are contagious. What a cool experience.

I love being from the south mane ❤
NPR, y’all CONSTANTLY do the thing!!’ This was great. Thank you!

I waiting for “Ha” 🤌🏾
The band in Dickies is just classic!!!
They represented the 504 very well!!!! I'm proud to be from the Nola!!! ⚜️💜💚💛
DopeSh** right chere, okaaaaay!!@ My son put me on to Juvenile back in 1999 & I've been a fan every since, TRUST this TinyDesk was exactly what I NEEDED & WANTED!!@
This was sooooooooooo great
I can’t explain it but this performance is making me want to twerk while crying simultaneously… it’s just doing all the things to my spirit. 🥹💃🏾🤸🏽‍♀️
Ayyyyyyye❤ whoever responsible for this 💪🏾💪🏾❤️🥶
Black Joy can mean many things but most importantly it means celebrating when you could, and perhaps should, be angry or mournful.  It is the act of producing art out of pain and it in this way it is an "essential act of survival." Black Joy is also the "idea that Black people can be happy, despite their trauma and history of oppression." Is there a better example than this Tiny Desk?  Juvenile and Manny Fresh turned Tiny Desk into the metaphorical black and tan Juke Joint. Black and tan clubs were juke joints which catered to a multiracial clientele. Jukes are/were the celebratory space mapping the cultural sounds of the Mississippi Delta. In the last shot of Manny Fresh in the crowd it is hard not to smile at the joy that is emanating from the crowd. The joy is infectious and is probably why most of the comments below are some expression of gratitude for allowing us to share in that joy.
I love my city so gotdayum much!! Thank youNPR!! You did good
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Man we gotta give Mannie Fresh his flowers fr. He’s behind so many classic records   Him and Juvenile turnt up the Tiny Desk ‼️😤
Umm was that Jon Batiste playing the melodica?
This was the tiny desk. We didn’t know we needed. Hands-down the best one so far.
I smiled the whole time!! Omg!
Came back to make sure he hit a milli…
The best Tiny Desk Hands Down
What a treat… Ayeeeee
This made my morning I got on YouTube and this popped up. I love Juvie and Mannie Fresh is the best dj love them. I definitely got athletic on the last song.❤
This is a real intimate celebration of music from our FAVS whoever is behind TINY DESK CONCERTS needs their flowers!!! This is so all that!!
So unexpected, but so good
Straight fire!!!!!!!!
Iconic

NOLA is ok. We good. Don't worry bout us!
The key board and guitar players 😍 omg!!
I LOVED THIS 🔥🔥
Alright Juve & Mannie represent.......it took the 504 to come up in NPR Tiny Desk and pull off a first ever encore performance.  I don't think people understand how big this was and they had Trombone Shorty and John Batiste on set with them, two of the biggest musicians in New Orleans.  1.4 million views in one day, so proud for NOLA my hometown. 👏🏾❤🔥
I was waiting for the Down Bottom song😅
This is fire! 💪😎
Juvy is a certified legend and was definitely ahead of his time and he is definitely in my top list of lyricist rappers fo sho juvy was spitting frfr

Tiny Desks actually make us see who really have talent or not because performing with a live band IS NOT EASY.. This is top tier.. like literally 2nd place to Usher Raymond's...
If you're a music lover, you enjoy the tiny desks JUST bc of the live bands, period.

This about to be the most viewed NPR desk concert. I'm just cheesing. 😂❤❤❤❤
AMMMAAAZZZINNNGGGGGG JUVE AND MANNIE THE LEGENDSSSS ‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️

This was pure fun and excitement ❤
Think u lost a little credibility when you made "Vaxx that Thang Up", but I'm not gonna deny you still got musicality.
I enjoyed every moment of this performance.
Great Job NPR!!!
This is why more rappers should perform with live bands
I love Fresh❤❤
PLEASE GIVE MANNY FRESH HIS FLOWERS 💐 NONE OF THIS POSSIBLE WITHOUT HIM! IM FROM LOUISIANA SO YOU JUST DONT KNOW HOW MUCH THIS MEANS!!!
Throughly enjoyed this concert! ❤
Who ever made this happen you really outdid yourself!! From beginning to end I danced and smiled. Shout out to Juvie and Mannie Fresh! 💐
I’ve been watching these tiny desk for some time. I subscribed after watching Juvie & Mannie Fresh. Let’s go New Orleans we in hea
This one was definitely dope & perfectly done for those who grew up to these classics! 🔥🔥🔥 they jammed the whole time. Ain’t miss a beat
20:04 Please stand for the Millennial National Anthem 🫡
AND THEY ARE AGING BEAUTIFULLY 😍
This was amazing! 🔥Great watch
Am i the only one who wishes he woulda performed "Ghetto Children"???🔥🔥🔥
What is Batiste playing?
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👍👍👍👍👍👍✌🙏
All these years later you still feel the tenor and emotion from Juvenile in his lyrics. Never skipped a beat.
This made my day! 😊😊😊😊
I wish I could have been there in person 😊
I feel like the New Yorker should write a nine thousand word piece on this.
The end of this Tiny Desk was EVERYTHING!!!
Y’all must’ve forgot when Juvie was on top!
Yesss Louisiana represent! One of the best Tiny Desks I seen!
Toooooo amazing!  Love this
You know you can't watch the encore without dancing!!
Also, the employees at NPR found out who had that ratchet in them.  😂😂😂
Eeeeverrrythiiiing!!!!❤ Loved it!!!
This was so good! Like we need a live recorder album with all of the same players puhhhleeezzee!
🫶👐🫶👐🫶
He only missed one word excluding the encore where he was just having fun. His talent and perfectionist mindset just put him on the bubble again 25 years later because people did need to be reminded. There are so many songs I wish he would have performed. If it would have went 2 hours I would still ask for more. The live band and Mannie Fresh being the d.j. and hype man put it on another level. It is not even close this was the best tiny desk and raised the bar. It was so pure. Imagine if he performed Down Bottom with the trumpets there.
Awesome
This was a musical journey. Each instrument told  a story!!
JUVIE THE GREAT❤❤❤❤
Calling it as the best tiny desk we’ve ever seen! The instrumentation coupled with the energy of the crowd and Juvie and Mannie’s legendary iconic place in Black music history! It’s perfect 🥹
BEST TINY CONCERT EVER💪🏾💯❤️I loved every minute of it!!
OG.
He cuttup to the highest degree
I loved this nostalgia!❤
WHEW🎉🎉🎉 the memories 🤯 these songs brought back.... we had some good times back then. And so thankful I was able to move to Mississippi and live through these moments during that time.... being that I'm a South Central LA born and raised gurl....  the South gave me the perfect balance!! The Hot Boys.
Legendary 🎉
400 degrees is a certified classic
Monday morning ride in gone be real good🎉🎉🎉🎉
Saw Juvenile in person, the only night my friends and I turned into Groupies! We saw him perform at a nightclub and followed the  bus to the hotel. He was super friendly outside walking his puppy. That was one of the BEST NIGHTS OF MY LIFE!! 🤎✨
I purchased 400 degreez back in 98 or 99 . I was a sophomore in high school.  Some good times, now it comes full circle.
This was freaking awesome
I swear this performance needs to be on all streaming platforms like yesterday!!!
🫡🫡🫡🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
Slow motion 🔥
I love this❤
My mama said if you got nothing good to say don't say it I'll practice that for this performance.
my heart is unbelievably warm
He should have done 25 to life
Come On nooooooow. This one right was epic. Took a sis way back.
The Culture Needed THIS!
Epic❤❤❤
Stop playing. JUVE ON TINY DESK. AND MANNY FRESH! I CLICKED ASAP
I was wondering why so much time was left after what had to be the finale song. OMG the encore was unbelievable!! I pulled my car over and danced like a fool🔥🔥🔥
9:24 Is that the first time the cameras cut to the crowd? I’ve seen a thousand of these tiny desks and never once have the guys in the booth go “we gotta cut to the crowd they’re having a blast!” Juvenile what a legend
Y'all, if you're not Louisiana I hope you enjoyed this. If you're from the BOOT...we here!!!!!!!!!!!!! PHUQ! Thank you NPR for letting this happen. My face is sore from smiling so hard...we underdog AF...I'm pretty emotional over this...NPR God bless you for this.
The best tiny desk performance I've seen JUVE THE GREAT 🔥🔥🔥

Best Tiny Desk EVER!!!!!
Juve the great. Don’t forget it, wodie.

This was epic!

Classic after classic…cash money really was the blueprint for bounce music and southern hip hop. Amazing!
Love seeing mannie there too …. Juuuuviiiieee 🙌🏾‼️‼️
Tiny Desk Concerts never fail to deliver 😊
Juvenile already sold his ppl out with the Vax That Thang Up BS.... Hes responsible for the loss of life due to his influence. Its too late for him to reinvent himself with old washed up songs. CANCELED!!!!
My goodness!!!! I’ve been patiently waiting since I saw the tik tok vid!! ❤❤❤❤❤
My child (hood) .. juvenile .. manor fresh ❤❤❤❤❤
This was GREAT!!!!
Juve is why we all know and loved cash money records...he blew rhe Doors off for them...mannie fresh too
🔥
This is the best Tiny Desk of 2023!!!
This is sooo much appreciated!!!!

This the concert I didn't know I needed but happy was given. Juvie left a void when he went away and this here really was🔥🔥
My favorite performance
I was disappointed they didn't do nola clap haha. Still a flawless, tiny desk performance
🔥🔥🔥
Bet
This completely started my month of July RIGHT! But the lyrics just make me realize how wild we were as kids listening to this knowing every word 🤣🤣😩😩
It’s the Black Joy & Talent for me 🙌🏽 bless Juve and everything he’s done for the culture 🏆
🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Classic ish 🖤
This is my favorite tiny desk 🎉
The Hood Preacher done laid his stamp on the tiny desk 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿😄 you can't tell me his voice don't remind u of a pastor throwin out dat Sunday sermon to the people. All I can say is thank you to everybody involved. Especially the band. I'm a lover of live performances and they did dat fasho. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I grew up in Hip Hop. Juvenile was my favorite Hot Boy. I listen to NPR for news. This was perfect.
Should of did ya understand
Yessssssss🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽encore baby!!! Love this!

Mannie fresh did his thing too❤
LIL WAYNE NEXT PLEASE!!!!
When you finally season the chicken!
Ayeeeeeeeee 💃💃💃
Man they looked like they were so joyous! It was just an inspired performance! Great idea!

The only one topping this performance is no one 😭
This is the most beautiful things ever. Wow gotta love US man. The kulture is everything
This brought back a lot of beautiful memories from my single days in the military stationed in Georgia, I can’t find the words to describe how I feel 😁 thank you Juvie for this, I enjoyed every moment of it, (and I’ve watched it several times already) we love you Juvie!!!!!!!!!
i would pay big money to go to a hot boys reunion tour.
Why this sound better than the cd like you can chill with your girl
❤😂🎉 the joy I have watching this!!!  New Orleans stand up!!!👑⚜🖤😅
Best one ever!
Never in a million years did I think my donation to NPR would provide me with this heat. Thank you guys for doing gods work 🙏🏽
Only one I’m mad he ain’t do is that gone ride wit me
When Mannie Fresh hit the “Ohhhh oohhh ohhhh” I was crying lol  Had a homie in high school who would walk the halls and do that 😂😂  The attention to detail made this one if not the best Tiny Desk concert I’ve seen! 🔥🔥✊🏾
My first CD ever was a 400 Degreez that pivotal moment in my life changed my views on rap and made me appreciate southern hip-hop in a way I can't even describe. After all the turmoil that happened with Juvenile throughout his career, I hope this showcase shows him that his music is truly timeless and is a staple in not only our culture but the whole music genre. Give the man his Flowers!!!
That  was like a travel back in time. Thank you. Excellently done!!
WOW! Bodied it.
🔥🔥🔥👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾‼️‼️‼️
“”I'ma T.C. soldier, New Orleans stunna If a b!tch leave me, I'ma take everything from her..” - 🐐

Cash money reunion most definitely needed. Especially a big tymers album
Living in the Light 5 This is the message we heard from Jesus and now declare to you: God is light, and there is no darkness in him at all. 6 So we are lying if we say we have fellowship with God but go on living in spiritual darkness; we are not practicing the truth. 7 But if we are living in the light, as God is in the light, then we have fellowship with each other, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, cleanses us from all sin. 8 If we claim we have no sin, we are only fooling ourselves and not living in the truth. 9 But if we confess our sins to him, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all wickedness. 10 If we claim we have not sinned, we are calling God a liar and showing that his word has no place in our hearts.(1 John 1:5-10)
Just in time for the summer ☀️☀️Juvie you did dat

I remember when cash money first came out . They had a concert in Memphis. One of my friends was dating one of their producers. So we had back stage passes. After the concert my friends and cash money went to dinner. But me and Juve went back to the hotel …( the Peabody hotel I think)he was exhausted and so was I…. He’s a very good guy … he treated me like royalty… we both crash out when we got back to the hotel… he never one time tried to disrespect me in no way ..…. He knew I wasn’t a groupie ..the next morning we both ate breakfast. .. and went our separate ways. But I can say he can snore LOUD!11 Juve the great .., I will always have respect for him.❤️
Dope🔥

@NPR Music. Tevin Campbell next pleasee!!!!
Who doesn't love an encore! So good 🔥🔥🔥
That was EVERYTHING!!!!!
It may just be a Black thing or maybe it's their influence on culture...as a DC guy, they look like DMV 🥷🏿 🥷🏿 🥷🏿 🥷🏿 in this performance. Think about them go-go bands that perform at spots you may not get shot at or at some event put on by DPR, Busboys, or maybe Park.
I loved EVERYTHING about this! Juvenile and Cash Money bring back so many great memories from my college days.
Yesssssssssssssssss
RESPECT. To the one who put me onto CASH MONEY

After the Tiny Desk, we need a Cash Money Millionaires tour!!! 🤞🏽🙏🏽
Slow motion was 🔥🔥🔥
The short curly hair girl in the crowd is stunning.
This history right here
I don’t know how to say this…and I’m a major music fan. Eclectic taste…old school head. Major R&B fiend and I love me both some deeply poetic & feel-good hip-hop BUT this?! What Juve did here??? Some of THEE best musical artistry ever displayed on a live set. The arrangements (including how the tracks followed each other {big up to my main man Mannie Fresh}, the energy, the preparedness, Juve’s rapport with the audience and how easy and natural he is on that stage? How on tempo he is? How good his voice still sound AND he remembers his own lyrics (and Mannie too). Thank y’all for taking this serious and spoiling us with almost full cuts of y’all hits. THIS is how it’s supposed to be done 🙇🏽‍♀️🙇🏽‍♀️🙇🏽‍♀️🙇🏽‍♀️. One of the best mainstream artist Tiny Desks and certainly in my top 5🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Why is the whole band fine though?
In my mind I was watching this live
I only came here to say….girl who is you playing wit? Back that thing up!  Reminded of how lit Cash Money was. I knew it was lit when the tall brother smiled and leaned back rapping with the team.  Music is everything.
The whole band can get it, actually 💦💦💦
This was hard 🔥🫡🔒
Juvie sparked the first Tiny Desk encore! Am I wrong?
One of the best Tiny Desks!!!!!!!🎉
😊❤
🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The instrumental sounds off. 😭😭 The guitar can go. Lol
Free BG! I know he did it but we need a Hot Boy reunion album/tour!
This was a throwback for me brought back memories, i enjoy it. Real rap music. 🔥👏
I love this so much❤
I need juvie to take this show on the road!!!! I can’t stop watching omgggg
Come through.... The best Tiny Desk ever❤
Thank you.
He killed it!!!!
C’mon Juvenile and I love me some Mannie Fresh! Live instruments are unmatched!  Absolutely loved this concert!!!!
JUVIE and MANNIE....that's it, that's all....
Ha got one of the best hooks ever! Just my opinion
If you are 41 like me, and from where I’m from, you are all about these dudes! So tight dudes.
Yooooo, to hear the Music come alive through live musicians. Dope!!! Simply Dope!!!! Mannie Fresh the Genius!!!! Juve the Great!!!
Juvie ❤, 500 degrees. My childhood, God I'm happy to be from New Orleans!
One word. Legendary!

The songs hit differently with the live instruments 🔥🔥🔥

Dear Tiny Desk Concert. I thought after TPain you could never do it again. I do apologize. This is another classic that should break the record. Furthermore, the person that is responsible for this MUST be promoted! They need a large desk and a corner office!
I don't know how but this needs to be framed. 🌹🏆.......and put in a time capsule!
Love all this
My childhood all over again, thank you, thank you, THANK YOU🙌🏾💐💐💐💐
Ayyye!!! 💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾

I’ve watched this way too many times; it's so good!!!!
I want Juvenile to do a symphony concert next!
I need to see this live. By far one of the best shows ive seen on tiny desk. Honestly the best show in my opinion their songs resonated so well live.
make me think im a teenager again...i never wanted this to end...Denzel Curry was my current favorite TDC but now it's Juve, and he did it all in velcro sandals
Erykah Badu was the 1st tiny desk I saw and its so relaxing no matter the artist!!
Loved it!
The whole energy of Mannie Fresh's verse during the encore brought me so much joy.
Erykah Badu was the 1st tiny desk I saw and its so relaxing no matter the artist!!

I just turned back to my single digit era. So nostalgic. Who was better than the Hot Boys in their prime: NOBODY!
I’m 48 and this took me back…. Found myself smiling the whole time. ❤
Love this… reminds me that men have been rapping abt what women are today and we loved it so we should love it now
ENCORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
To think that Juvenile didn’t want to do this. I’m happy he changed his mind.
This is the Tiny Desk I never knew I needed! Bravo!!!
Shout out hot boy Turk
Worth the wait and so awesome that Mannie Fresh was there too!!
One of the best Tiny Desks; that was so fun!
Nobody bring 🔥 like Tiny Desk
Thank Lil Ya of UNLV for juvenile as we know him. He had given up on rap and got a job, never knowing what he was about to give up lil ya saw him at the bus stop headed to work and told him to come to the studio with him the rest is history!😮‍💨
I’ve never seen this much of the Tiny Desk floor plan. Juvie and Mannie did the thing!

This was too good! Had me back in the 99 and 2000s 😂. Let’s get this to number 1 trending
I didn't understand the lyrics when I was 17. My parents were right about keeping me away from this type of music 🎶 😅😂
No auto tune.  Sounds good 👍👍👍👍
I would pay a lot of money to go to this show
On point 🔥🔥🔥🔥
They killed it, plus one!!!!
We need wayne on one!
Just what I needed ❤
Mannie Fresh is the best

Amazing performance.
MANNNNNN this was beyond dope! 🔥🔥🔥
Lemme find out you don't want to see (Juve) on
What I like about these type of shows is the talking between songs its entertaining. Great idea.
Us 80's babies who were raised in the 90's are keepin' the muzik of our Era alive!!! This concert literally happened because his fans put him on to Tiny Desk. Now here we are actin' a mfn fool in our livingrooms.  😂💃🏾🥃
I have watched Tiny Desk for years… this series is top tier. Charlie. Baby face Juvie… all of them! Man… Usher! Amazing.
This made my day!!!!
You can see Juvenile’s soul smiling!!! This was the best Tiny Desk Ever!!!!
This was amazing an instant classic. Definitely one of the tiny desk videos I will have to return to ever once and a while.
Nostalgia!!!!!

I can’t express in words how much I enjoyed this - screaming out loud to myself at certain parts! Juvy’s music is aging like a fine wine 🤌🏼  Also - Mannie Fresh!!! 🔥

I’ve watched this since 12 pm yesterday. Love it
Love me some Juvie ❤
I have followed tiny desk for years…. && I love it so much! But this………this brought my to tears because I don’t think some people will ever be able to grasp the magnitude of how full of life… how amazing…. how fun… and beautiful this was to see …. Hats off Tiny Desk because this is by far my now favorite Tiny Desk of them all 🙏🏽
Best one yet.
This concert took me right back to my early college days, when the Hot Boyz/Cash Money had me and my people in a chokehold.  When white T-shirts/tanks, Girbauds, Reeboks, and Burberry were a staple in hip hop fashion.  What a time to be alive! Thanks for the memories.
This was dope didn't know I needed this...who would have wondered!
He did this🎉🎉🎉for the 99 and 2000s
💯✊👏🙌
Shout out to Dj Manny Fresh! That’s my Dj!!!
This is literally insane 🔥🔥🔥🔥
For all the new school producers,  Mannie Fresh is showing how much of a genius he is and why Cash  Money took over in the 90s and 2000s
NPR has been killing it with the last few tiny desk concerts ❤❤❤ I mean Babyface, Uncle Charlie Wilson, Tank, and Juvie and Mannie Fresh with John Bastite omg I’m loving this ❤❤❤❤❤
Almost a M in a day! Mr 400 needs to comeback!!!

RIP to Juvenile son… Great performance..
Juvenile, DJ Mannie Fresh, Trombone Shorty, Jon Batiste, Alvin Ford, The Louisiana Philharmonic, the band and The Amours served up a musical gumbo with a half-smoke on the side.   Now everyone is going to put in WORK for an encore 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Some of the best music was made in the 99 and 2000s.
Love this!
I forgot about set it off such a good song….
8:05 ❤ but this whole video was good and he seems genuinely happy 😊

Juve did his thing as usual. And 26:55 classic Fresh 😅. I was on youtube debating a dude because I said Juve needs to do a Versuz. He was saying he didn't have the hits. I guess we see now! The band had a great flavor. Everybody did great!

Juvi is tht dude NOBODY is calling out to do a verzus.....
This was definitely the best 28 minutes of my life.😂🖤✌🏾
Literally the coolest show ever
Best Tiny Desk Ever ❤❤❤❤
MY FOLK!!!

Loved every minute of it
Mannie Fresh top 5 producer all time !!
NPR🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Iconic!!!
I love this !!
Lyrics are so embarassing and ignorant. Shame cuz otherwise its so cool. Update the words with the same flow and it would be perfect. The white npr people are such hypocrites for giving it a platform.
Louisiana just gone Louisiana no matter the setting.
10/10
Justice
USS Abraham Lincoln  when that 400 degrees dropped we was in different ports acting bad off that Juvenile.  Soulja rag and all .🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 Juve deserve his flowers.  And mannie fresh as well
When I saw the “Ha” video I was in shock. I’m from the South Jamaica “40” projects, Queens, NY. Seeing the Magnolia projects on that video really made me look at life a different way. I’ll forever be a Juve fan
TWERK THAT WORK THAT, SERVE THAT
Standing Ovation Represented for Da Soufff!!!
Wow🔥🔥
10/10!!!!
🔥🔥👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥💪🏾💪🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🎶🎶🎼 Enjoyed this whole concert! My 3rd time watching this🕶👏🏾
One thing about Nola…..we gonna scratch together. No matter how far we stray apart this was dope. Now I want a Hot Boys one. BG on his way home.
Juvie such a legend. No other rap will ever touch late 90s rap.  The south carried rap for years.
Neat. Not sure anyone was actually wanting a Juvenile tiny desk concert but now we have it!
Juveyyyyyyy!❤
I dont remember the first time I heard juveeeeeee but i do know it was before I knew who Wayne was..97 98 maybe.. I still know every word😊
How do we get the invite to tiny desk 🙌🏾
FIRE 🔥 this so lit.  I love being a New Orleans native. JUVE!!!!!!!
Amazing moment
Grown he showing that D.C love!
Music and the dickie fits... feeling 35 in '03... classics
I’ve watched or listened to this over 20 times 3 days in. The man’s catalog is underrated. And Mannie Fresh is DEFINITELY overlooked. This was beautiful. Back in the days of real hip hop
This gave me everything I didn’t know I needed from a tiny desk!
28 minutes straight tears. this energy is pure love. reminds me that life is worth living and celebrating despite the hellscape. BIG LUVVVVV
Taking me back to my childhood
New Orleans sons. We live for this!
@20:13 As soon as the beat drop 💃🏽💃🏽
SSSSSSSSSSSHHHHHHHAAAAAAOOOOWWWWW 😎
THE BEST TINY DESK CONCERT ...........
I Love this!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤
Juve the Goat
The band was INCREDIBLE!

A love letter to Louisiana
The tiny desk we never knew we needed 🔥🔥🔥🔥 he should have done u understand
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽🖤🖤🖤💯
Manny and Juve just need to drop an album before all is said and done
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Not even playin but is dude sittin down Whoopi Goldberg child??
This was everything
Juvenile sounds the same live like if he was in the studio

Have to give credit to the crowd. Watch Juve open up as the concert progresses. Everyone fed off each other’s energy = great performance
Wow! I Just rediscover a new Juvenile
Man i wish he could’ve done this in Houston or Houston had some legends do some concerts! Juvenile is 🔥
I've always loved Tiny Desk but this one right HERE, blessed my soul. Thank you!!
This just gave me so much life!!!!!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Mannie Fresh is a living legend too- his production influenced the sound of modern hip hop Probably more than any other producer

The nostalgia in all the eyes of the band sold it for me. Memories were made to these hits and they continue to this day. Timeless music. J
!!!!!!
One of the best tiny desk concerts 👏👏👏
Been running the music business the last 25 years 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I respect any platform that requires an artist to have a live band!!! Thank you, NPR! These track shows ain't were it's at! People can listen to your records at home for free, basically... NPR ain't never failed me yet!!! Keep'em coming!
Usher, then Too Short, now Juvenile...Love it!!! I want more
I haven’t watched em’ all but this is the first encore I’ve seen on Tiny Desk and the first time seeing the artists physically interact with the crowd. 🔥🔥🔥🔥
My teen years and early adult hood years..❤
This made me homesick. You can take me outta Nola, but you will never take the Nola outta me
Being a 55 yr old westbanker from NOLA.  I thought this was  awesome.  Plenty artists on Tiny Desk play there 3 songs and roll out. Juvy, Mannie, Trombone Shorty, Baptiste & the band put on a show for you.  Nobody in that room had a bad day after that performance.  It made my day. THANK YOU!! I have a Trombone Shorty Remarque Jazz Fest Print hanging in my home along the Miss Gulf Coast right next to my 2006 Jazz Fest Fats Dominoe Remarque Print!!  You might move away from the BIG EASY, but you can't take the BIG EASY OUT OF YOU!! 👍👍Thank you again, you Killed It!! They need sum of that to kick off the Saints in the dome this year!!! Talk about get the crowd fired up!! Get the blood flowing!!
❤ it... how do you become an audience for Tiny desk?
Absolutely Awesome
i am so glad my taxes paid for this.

I’m sure no one wanted to leave that moment. They had everyone high off life. Manny letting the crowd shine was definitely one of the best tiny desk moments.
Listen they need them 80-90's babies in there cause we would have had some liquor in our hand singing like crazy with these songs
Haaaard
He started this mf wit one of my fav Juvie songs 400 degrees
💯❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
JUVIEEEEEEEE and MANNIE FRESH, SICK COMBO 🔥
They rocked it! The instruments set it off... I LOVE MUSIC!! 💃🏾💃🏾
This is brilliant- I remember my 12 year old self was totally transfixed seeing the music video for “Ha”; Juvenile was holding an alligator in the video and it was like glimpsing another world entirely
Aaaayy! 💃🏽
Youuuuuuu don’t want to fcck with meeeeeee ….. man I used to tear this album up in my high school daysss!!!
These boys look good man, I hope I age well too😊😊😊😊
I’m firing the crowd!!! They would’ve almost needed security for his real fans

Hip hop Prime No autotune🎉❤

@9:25 That's all he needed from the crowd. 19:30 You knew it coming. Ladies, time to stretch.
Once them strings came out everybody knew what time it was 😂😂 back that a$$ up
The musicians in the back and the amours were amazing. Shout out to them. You can tell they were having fun
I watched like 3 times the instrumentation sooooo raw 🔥🔥 Puttin on for the whole Louisiana 💯
My childhood was lit because of these 2 music geniuses. I love being from down south and even more because we have music out here that will never die. Congratulations to Juvi and Frrsh.🔥🔥💙💙
🔥🔥🔥

i feel so fulfilled
This gave me the The Greatest Joy….. S/O to who conjured this up
The fact that he can rap his songs with a live band and still sound just as good as the actual track speaks volumes! These young rappers can’t compare to this level of live performance as they need too much editing/auto tune
Black Exellence
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️
IMMACULATE VIBES!!!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
That was THE BEST ONE!! I rocked hard the entire time!! Give them their flowers!!

Tiny Desk 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Rodeo performance !!!
I love how Juvie and Fresh still have the same energy from the OG Cash Money Day's 💯
The way I'm sweating!!!
Y’all really got the crowd into this one. DOPE!!!!! Please don’t miss the ending it’s a vibe.
My favorite part is how hype the musicians are 😆😭😭love it!!
The man who built Cash Money !
One of the best TD vids ive seen a while!
Being a young man in the city around this time I can't even explain to people the vibe around New Orleans when 400°  dropped.  Edit: ran into Juvie a handful of times back home. Man was the coolest even at the height of his popularity.
That polo shirt is hard
Love it!
Man, I can’t stop watching this. Took me back to my senior year and early 20’s.
Juve bringing out the greats Jon Batiste and Trombone shawty was the icing on the cake! 10/10!!
The background vocalist sound beautiful ❤❤
YESSSSS WE NEEDED THISSSSS
Me. Trying to maintain my composure and not turn up to much as I breastfeed my 4 week old baby with my airpods in. I did wake him up once.
This right here was much needed!!! Real food for the soul
Thank you
This performance was incredible and that encore tho!
Yeahhhhh Juvvvvvv
Mannie Fresh is slept on. That man is a dam genius 🔥🔥🔥
From the 99 to the 2000s and beyond Juvenile, Mannie Fresh, and the Hot Boyz will never go out of style. Thank you NPR for blessing us with this!
When the trombone hit that was nice 16:01

Maaaaaaaaaaan.
Man I can't believe he wasn't gonna do this at first 🔥🔥🔥
Being a northern coming down to N.O hearing a live band was magical. This tiny desk concert was dope
That crowd rapping along to Juve are the same ones that NPR will later post talking about machoistic lyrics like Juve are bad for society and creating toxic masculinity😂
This soooo HARD 🔥🔥🔥 especially slow motion
Manny is a genius
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
YASSSSS👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🎶❤️❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
It's really hope for us noggas
Juve weekend cleaning music yes

Maaaaaaan! Thank you NPR! You don't know how much we, I needed. Bless up!
Enjoyed tf out of this ‼️
Manny look more fresh being older . That hair cut fire 👌🏾⭐️🌟⭐️
🔥🔥🔥 A cultural GOAT. If juve was born 60 years earlier he'd be looked at like Louis Armstrong.
I didn't know I needed this but I very much did.
Juve and Mannie baby ⚜504⚜
This is SO FUN
Juivi🔥🔥🔥🔥low country SC know every thing he saying👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾
Mannie♥️
I feel like this was God’s plan after having Juvie on repeat for the last two weeks 🙌🏾
Never a fan but this was dope.
JUVIE!! MANNIE!! 🙌🏾 🔥
Holy Cow! This was so good. Definitely made my day better.
Love juvenile
Let’s gooooo!
Manny look the same
Trombone Shorty!!! ⚜️
Juve the great 🔥🔥🔥🔥 when i was in high school i was the only on in the bronx playing 400 degrees
I’ve literally been smiling the whole time 🔥🔥
No disrespect to the young kids but you really had to be outside when Cash Money had their run. This is historic. Well done Juve and Mannie Fresh.
This was dope!!! Band is bomb AF!! I might’ve paused a few times to get a better look at homeboy on the bass lol
This is the best tiny desk, hands down!  We need the rest of the Hot Boys!
Ok uncles!!! 💞🆗
Juve did phenomenal!! This was cool
They been on point with the artist choices!!!💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽
Best tiny desk ever hands down
Wow! Wow! Rodeo was simply amazing. Brought me back to 99-00’s thank you Nola!!
Juvy!!!!……..Juvy!!!! and he’s from da Magnolia🔥🔥🔥🔥 Man I got chills hearing fresh do the intro
Mannie Fresh = LEGEND
Everything!!🎉🎉🎉
BRAVO!!! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Love all of the artists, but this live instrumentation 💕💕💕💕
Classic self destruction here. Too much profanity and self deprecation. Would it have been too much for Juvie to perform radio edits?
Easily one of the best Tiny Desk’s ever.  Thank you for this!
90s babies really enjoy this
This was epic!🔥🔥🔥
Manny fresh left his eye brows in New Orleans.
😮😮😮

One time for my city🤎
Love this for Juvi and Mannie Fresh
This made my day. It was like i hoped in a Time Machine ‘99. The golden age of hip hop
Always remember, in the Year of our Lord 2023, Juvenile, Mannie Fresh, and this fantastic ensemble (watch the whole thing to see what I mean) performed a Tiny Desk Concert at the NPR studios in Washington, D.C. What a time to be alive!
They are still 🔥 I love this so much. Whoever made this happens needs a raise
Juvie was always better than Lil wayne to me
This is my favorite one ever I think
This is EVERYTHING we needed this summer!!! ❤❤❤ Thank you Juve and Fresh! Thank you NPR!

Best episode of the show

Not that the crowd told him to run it back again! We need more classics like this man.
I didn’t know I needed this!…Especially that love song at the end 😂. 🙏🏾
This was so dope 🔥
One of the best ones yet! That band was 🔥
This is from my youth. Geaux Juvie!!! Mannie Fresh none other💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽
*Bro, they weren't live enough for me, Juve was on that oil, and Mannie was doing his signature dance and killing it. The band and singer were on point! Best free show I I ever seen, thank you, tiny desk top! Oh yeah, Babyface, Charlie Wilson, and now Juve the Great! Give whoever is picking the acts a raise. It's going to be hard to top this!*
This was necessary!!! 🔥🔥🔥
Refreshing for my soul 💃

This goes unnecessarily hard!
Killed it! Everybody was on point🔥
Juvy should have a 30+ crowd out there cause that bih would've been live 😂
I love how much fun they're having. Vibe is incredible!
Somebody needs to drop the @ of the dude in the crowd w the NPR shirt on. For research purposes…
Man I miss these days
Best Tiny Desk Concert ever
i thank god they did this
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Man this was for the culture 🔥🗣️
🔥🔥🔥
Man, Juve da great! So much energy and brought the 504 to the Big Apple. Grew up in New Orleans during the 99 n the 2000’s and these songs were the soundtrack to my life. So great to see Juve get the love and flowers he deserves. And Mannie Fresh up there with him too. Both legends. Brought the vibes I needed today!
Dam this soooo nostalgic!!! I feel 17 again
Best tiny desk ever 🎉

The only tiny desk concert I watched more than once. This too Epic
This did not disappoint I'm reliving childhood joy on this one.
As a New Orleans native I'm always excited to see someone from da'NO rep tiny desk, but seeing Juve & Mannie took me back to my college days! This was so dope to see, big ups to everyone who put this together. ❤⚜️
Amazing. Taking me back!
An encore!! Sure why not!! It’s Juvie ❤
This was a treat
Take the band on the road w/ the Amores ! Juvey this would be a great look and revitalize the brand
Juve is the truth. He's always been my favorite out of the Hot Boys 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I don’t know why this made me cry. Enjoyed every second ❤
Best ever 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Without Juvie I’m not sure Cash Money ever blows up…he’s a legend!
This was so dope to see a juvenile and manner fresh reunion
I was smiling and had chills the ENTIRE time. I was 6-11 years old rapping these songs 🥹🥹🥹🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Well this is friggin awesome.
This is what hip hop shows should all be like
Juvie should’ve dropped more music
Top 5 Tiny Desk🔥🔥🔥🔥
Thank you Tiny Desk, this was one of the best. This one was for the culture. 70’s Baby Era. ❤
Juve was my first album I’ve ever bought with my own money in the 6th grade 400 degreez still get bumped til this day 1:05 and had the nerve to start the show with my favorite song off that album!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I didn’t even won’t this to end stand up 🔝 Louisiana
Juvenile sippin the strawberry banana probiotic 🧃
We need OutKast next ❤
So underrated JUVE THE GREAT!!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
🔥❣️
this was fire!!!
Mannie with the DETAILS on set it off 🔥
Legendary
Yes indeed Thank you Tiny Desk Juvie the  Great Living Legend  for the  '99 and '00 ❤
omg the set it off was so fire!!
Great performance.  Love it
That thang!!!🔥🔥🔥 19:15
Man I've been waiting on this one... Awesome - I loved every second of it!!!
This was the one right here!!!🔥🔥🔥
This was beautiful! The audience wasn’t giving! This is what I needed to start my Saturday off! Love
Maaaan this was fun to watch I wish I could see Wayne perform his old stuff
SOOOO GOOOOD!! This video took me back to riding around downtown ATL on a $10 tank of gas that lasted 2 weeks. The radio was BUMPIN, twerking in your seat while you die of heat lol! Wooooo this was so well done!!! Thank you for all the retweets and reconsideration 😂😂!   I just wanted to say that I really appreciated the cadence of the sax player! As a clarinet player who was friends with the sax player, they get in the zone lol and he was in it! The band as a whole crushed that thang! Much appreciated Juvenile and Mannie!!
Super Dope ‼️
This was SO DOPE!
I can die happy😃 😇
I need all of these songs on a live album 🔥🔥🔥
Masego could barely contain himself haha
Nostalgic ⚜️
This was a 10/10.. I’m happy that Juvenile got the ability to highlight his music, it has been a staple in the culture for 20+ years. In any club or black family function these  songs still go triple platinum.
Why this ain't at a million views already?!!! That's okay I'm gone run it up! Cause this my 3rd time watching 😂😂
This. Is. Art!  The resonance of Juve's voice. The integration of Mannie's sound. The guest artists being woven into this N.O. set  The collective energy of the musicians and singers.  Flames. 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Love how much fun Juvie and Mannie are genuinely having. It really makes it that much better.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Without MannieFresh production.... Cash money wouldn't be cash money
I LOVED THIS SO MICH ❤. DO ANOTHER ONE SO I CAN COME LOL😂
Uncle Juvenile tha great I grew up off ya music thank you playa and everyone that played apart in your journey brother & what up to mannie fresh and the whole cash money y’all the biggest to ever do it str8 legendary appreciate all y’all Also in closing juvenile you did your thing on this video everyone that played apart in tiny desk npr juvenile definitely understood the assignment on this
Juve killed this! Big ups to Mannie Fresh too. We definitely need a Mystikal Tiny Desk concert.
THANK YOUUUUU’
A MASTERPIECE!!
The culture fully represented here! Was at Grambling State University and knew about June and Hot Boys before their big distribution deal! Amazing show and legend for Juvenile! No one sounds like you delivers your style  you are a jewel and glad they giving you your flowers❤❤❤❤
The dickie suite and camouflage 😂😂😂😂 🔥🔥🔥💯💯
Nostalgic, but makes me really wonder why we as black men can't seem to grow up smh....
We from the Magnolia home of the Soliders
First time I heard juve was on a bootleg cd or tape before he had hit the radio or TV up here in MD. The sound was from another planet. Had no idea if we were ever going to hear another album. Balsted it for months and then bam he was on TV and the radio. Hearing this took me back to the first time.
They need to do a Hot boys reunion tour!
I’m only 1 min in and I’m loving in
This is important for young hip hop lovers to watch. Juve and Cash Money changed the game a couple times.
24 hours later and it’s still making me dance!!! NEEDED THIS
Dope set and collaborative performance all the way around 👍🏽👍🏽🔥session 💥boom
This is what it's about!!! Sooo good❤
Yo John Baptiste face like what is happening 😂
Yea this definitely in my top 5 Tiny Desk. Juvie and Mannie really had the city on they back with this one.  🖤💛
It was good to see Juve again he looks so good.
gahhhhd dayyum this was nostalgia. I couldn't be more hype for this video to come! Everything was perfect and got me smiling the whole way
Baby the tiny desk got red beans and rice all over her. She is no longer the Tiny Desk. She will forever be the THick Desk! Whew! Y’all wore it out!

This is truly a excellent tiny desk episode!  Juvenile are you kidding me. It was a party in that office!  Great job NPR!
I’ve watched this 4x already! Phenomenal❤️
👏👏👏👏👏 That is all I can say...well done
CHILLS!!!!!! We need this in album form!
Didn't know how much I needed this🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼👏🏼👏🏼💜
Wow took me BACK this was amazing and full of nostalgia
I was completely unprepared for how good this is.
That moment when you realize you should have Juvenile perform live at your wedding reception 😂
Wow I like how he played it off but the musicians started to play Wayne's Go Dj instead of June's song
Juvenile and Mannie fresh put cash money on the map....
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Dang they sound like the Albums!!!! 🔥 🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯
🔥🔥🔥🔥Man not juve and manny!!!
Juvie Da Great ✊🏾
This 28 mins concert was better than the BET Awards!!! (Coco Jones and Lola were the only performances I enjoyed. Also, I like Busta and his speech as well.)

Best tiny desk! R.I.P. Soulja Slim! 🙏🏽
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I’ll never forget when I first heard “Ha” as a preteen in NYC… The song still has me in a chokehold to this day.  That beat and the message was captivating:  “make nothing outta something you handle your biz and don't be crying and suffering”   Salute to Juvie the GOAT and Cash Money, You are appreciated and loved. Thank You❤❤❤
Absolutely amazing
I’ve never backed it up to a violin before but yes yes YES I’d do it again!! This was epic!!❤
🔥🔥🔥
This was easily the most hype tiny desk ever

This is for the culture!!! If you didn’t have his cassettes you don’t understand!!!
👏🏼👏🏼🔥🔥🔥
As a black man and musician from Louisiana, I can’t express how much this means to me these songs are engraved into the fabric of our state. Thank you so much NPR.
@21:39 that's the highest praise you can get as a musician! He slid that run in so smooth that dude next to him had to react! Lol
That gotta be the most fun I've ever had watching a tiny desk set.

This was so hard 🔥🔥🔥 and Mannie Fresh is one of the greatest producers ever
Moving office furniture as I prepare to back this 🍑 up    🎉🎉❤️❤️❤️
Juve gave my husband and I one of the best concert experiences ever! We were in Houston and the crowd was, easily, less than 100 people. He said, "F it, we gone rock this like we're in an arena." And HE DID!!! I'm HERE for this Tiny Desk!
Amazing!!!
🔥🔥🔥
As an older millennial this took me back to middle school and high school!! Hands down one of favorite performances!

I'm Seriously in Real Happy Tears being from N.O.  What are these awards shows waiting on to give these people there flowers NOW. Not a Tribute when they're gone. MANNIE FRESH needs to be Recognized in a huge way. This Tiny Desk was good to our Soul. They brought Grammy winners with them. The crowd was so into this swssion. I love my City & it's Culture. ❤⚜️⚜️⚜️
best love song lol, we talk about today generation but generation x is rachet skanks, ask me how I know
Whether you like his music or not, there is no denying the showmanship, vibe, and spirit of this performance. I've been watching Tiny Desk for years and this was one of the best!!!
This should be trending on YouTube🎶
I will now be donating to NPR on a monthly basis. This is better than any pledge drive or tote bag gift or anything I’ve ever seen.
Ayyyyyyyoooooo the band is fire 🔥

I wish juvenile would have burned that tiny desk.... then we could all be saved when the rest of those weird, woke, gender affirming, child mutilators went along with the desk.  Trump 2024 and repeal term limits!
🔥🔥
He brought out Jean Baptiste I almost passed out
So please understand these two plus B.G are the true pioneers of cash money Juvie was on his way to super stardom before him and birdman stopped seeing eye to eye
Him and t-pain top 2 for sure

THIS WAS FOR THE CULTURE FR 🎉🎉 LOVED EVERY MINUTE but that one more time ❤️‍🔥🔥🔥
They turned it out!!!
The piano player and the percussionist said we put on the Dickey suits but I’m not wearing a bandana on my head and segregated themselves to the side😂. I love this performance it was amazing. But juvenile’s bandana is exactly how my Momma ties up her bandana to go to bed😂. It’s good they are giving this man his flowers while he still here. Band was awesome too! Love this for us❤
Juve and Fresh were long overdue for their flowers. So happy to experience this. They are def icons and this tiny desk showed a new generation the artistry that they possess!! 🔥 🔥
Now that's a performance
Hey!!! Mannie's parts of the songs are 🔥🔥!! Like he be on point!!!
Only if we knew at that time we were living in a great time.
I said before and I’ll say it again… there is NO CASH MONEY or YOUNG MONEY without JUVE THE GREAT!!! Pt some respeck on his name!!!

凶暴である 💀 平均的でない
If you from south Louisiana you know our core is so different. Bands in Louisiana from Mardi Gras parades to street performances baby we don't play. Every high school comes with it or they don't come. I love my roots would not trade for nothing or no where
I lost all of my got darn marbles when Juve performed HA👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
🔥🔥🔥
Manny hitting the adlibs on Set It Off 🔥🔥🔥
Never disappointed … anytime I hear this music “stretching my glutes “ 😂
We officially some old heads lol
I need to apply for a job at @TinyDesk frfr.
Let’s be clear: Juvenile is one of the only rappers that can say what he’s saying and have everybody respect. As a woman, I believe every word coming out of juvi mouth. I loved him before and love him even more after this. Boy ya showed out!
Like, why? Why did y’all have to do this to us!  So undeserving we are! Lol. Love it!❤
This was the BEST tiny desk performance....❤❤❤ Juvie and Manny Fresh 🎉🎉
How this came together of Twitter and then it still surpassed all high expectations. Well done, Juve.

Yo! This is simply delightful!  ❤👏🏾Didn't know I needed this. Can we talk more about Juvy breath control cause..what? Also I want Mannie Fresh to do audio books or narrate cause his voice is mad soothing! Whole thang fun, fun! 🔥
They set it off in that mf 😆 phenomenal show and I’m so glad Juvie agreed to do it. Give it up for mannie’s composition & the musicians
Legendary!
I can't help but think that I'd be twerking on the floor during the encore 😭. It's the most twerkable song in history and the crowd was not giving it. I appreciate that they had some sense about themselves, though 😂.
This version of 400 Degreez is 🔥.
I loved when they jumped in the audience. You can tell they really love ppl and what they are doing! That’s the best.
Awesome
🔥🔥🔥🔥🤩🤩🤩🤩❤️❤️❤️❤️
This is off the chain

Listen he’s a amazing bussiness man this lyrics from the struggle now he’s what needs be! A king! “Be the lion you got be to be the sheep you need be!” -David chapplle
I love it 😀  amazing job at the tiny desk;  Dad's & Father's Reflecting on 👍
Juvie is disgusting 😂
Real rap real pain real stories !
I love tiny desk!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Man been waiting for dis juvenile straight legend!
Dude on piano and the guitarist closest to him look like they could be brothers
This is, hands down, one of the BEST Tiny Desk Concerts EVER!!! Every second of it was so ill!!!
Juvy and Mannie Fresh def represented for our city and for the best to ever do it Cash Money mfkn Records!!! They def deserve flowers💯🔥🔥🔥🔥
And that hood legend did it all in a pair of flip flops!!! I’m glad this is the generation i was raised on  @juvethegreat 🔥💪❤️
🔥🔥🔥 one of the best. Slow motion went crazy!
Npr and everyone who likes this raise up your ukraine flags while you do your awkward and cringe dance listening to this guy rap about s3x money and drugs while you lap it up like nerdy bandwagoners because it's black people singing it lol, so lame and cringe.
28 minutes of pure greatness ‼️🔥🎶🎶🎶🙌🏽
The personal nostalgia of "Rodeo" was everything for me. Loved this desk concert
凶暴である
Straight flames 🔥 I love juvenile and he low key had bars no one knew.
Boy I’m blasting this in the truck🔥🔥
my song!!!
Man, that Slow Motion song takes me BACK!
Man straight 2002 vibes in Oakland At the And 1 basketball games in the summer
The reason why I love this, he sounds exactly the same live as the record, not even missing a beat. Juve impact is underrated.  He has his own unique sound and unique, I doubt this new artist can perform live and sound the same.
This was unbelievable! UNBELIEVABLE!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
The smiles say it all. One love!
so dope!!
Juvenile the king
I wish Turk woulda came out during I need a hot gurl
20:04 You're welcome. I appreciate this entire show and love the acoustic arrangements but ya'll know you were waiting for them to drop this and they delivered!
Dude I needed this right now. Juve, Mannie fresh, that band. New Orleans still has it ❤
I instantly sent this to mom deuce 🔥🔥🐐
Absolutely 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥
The energy is unreal
The Intro crazy
This when the south was really rapping cus they had something to prove !!!!!
Juvenile doesn’t age at all grew up listening to him and the hotboyz
Mannie fresh is the most slept on producer of all time !!!! This man was behind all those cash money classics !!!!
Talk about a blast from my youth!!! It’s always refreshing to hear songs you grew up with played again by the OGs from a time when ppl could actually rap! bc nowadays these so called “new era rappers” are horrible!
i immediately hit like before even hearing the entire performance because i know what Juvi is coming with .... this is my childhood .. i love his music and that era
Adding this to my labor playlist. Ooooo the nostalgia for this 80s baby.  Rip to June the biggest Hot Boyz fan in the Bx.
I love juvenile so much I went to three concerts of his . I be rapping song for song 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Thank you Tiny Desk this is def one of the best
Original hot boy
So fire
No licking

Almost forgot how many hits juvenile had. Might have been the best tiny desk I’ve seen so far
NEW ORLEANS

Rodeo was angelic
In New Orleans for the Essence Festival in my hotel and this pops 💯🏌🏾

Mannie sound effects ⚡🔊
Pure nostalgia!…now can we PLEASE get the no limit, cash money verzus!!!
This is what genuine fun looks like. These are some real guys.

After watching this... The Essence Fest should be ashamed of themselves for initially not inviting him to perform

This was everything! Dope energy/ performance/ connection.. 🙌🏾🙌🏾
An NPR Tiny Desk concert is #2 on YouTube trending. Will wonders never cease?  Also, I love that the auto-generated CC can't understand Juvie. 😂
Juvenile and Manny Fresh always have the showmanship in their performances. A big shout out to the band people and the ladies who provided vocals on rodeo.
EPIC
This gave me the BIGGEST SMILE 😊 i've had watching youtube in a while.. thank to everyone involved this was fire fr❤🔥 from a Juveee and old school cash money fan from Australia🇦🇺👍
This was soooo dope! Made my Night!😊😊😊
Buy his drink juvie juice. It’s 🔥
Yooooo!!!!! This was crazy. I wish I was there. Juvenile and Mane could destroy most of today's rappers easy. Cash money was total different level!!!
Whatttt!!! 🫶🏼❤👏🏼
I've seen a number of iconic Tiny Desks but this one gave me a warmth I can't even describe. Everyone made this one extra special...never seen the audience this hyped! Well done Juve, Mannie Fresh and the entire talented band! Thank you ever so much Tiny Desk!
I’m sitting at work tryna contain myself, but I really wanna hope on top of the desk and twerk on a headstand 💃🏾💃🏾
This was so well done. I loved this so much ❤
The Tiny Desk Concert we didn’t know we wanted! 🔥 🔥🔥
This was everything!!!!!
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Awesome  :)
Is juvenile the first to get an encore and 2x play in a row
2 minutes in: haven't understood one word; it's like he's chanting in Japanese. Nice music and beat though. No time to listen to more.. Well, it's getting so much praise, maybe it gets better. ... Oh well, guess I'm not a rap fan. Life is short, can only do so much. I love everybody, though. Peace out.
This is the best thing I’ve ever seen I love it so deeply in soul
This is EVERYTHING!!
I believes this tops Charlie but not Mac Miller
My Era ❤❤❤
Cmon New Orleans.  We been waiting on this. It's Juvy ☺
I present to you... black excellence
Mannie fresh makes me smile. Seems like such a genuine soul.   Love you too, Juvi
A+++++++++++
Cash Money 4 Lyfe!!! Juve, B.G., Turk, Wayne, Big Tymers. You couldn't tell me I wasn't a Hot boy!

Salute king! 👑🔥🔥
Tiny desk staff know what the people need 🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Mid to late 90s🔥
🔥🔥🔥
Legendary!
So Magnolia much love NUSSY Magnolia stamp
They absoloutly killed this set, brought me back to my teens
This was fuqqin FIREEEEE ❤❤
God dame that was amazing!!  Thank you NPR for making it happen. Juvenile you need a come to New Zealand please my bro. Heeeaps a fans down in the far far south of the world haha!! Much love
Legendaryyyy! All rap performances need to be done with a live band. 🔥🔥🔥
Thank you fr needed this
Man! If you didn’t slap all these songs with the windows down driving nowhere!
I enjoyed every minute 😂❤🔥🔥🔥
Nothing like the New Orleans beats, bouncing and rhythms...personally wish there was less expletives, but still REALLY enjoyed the music!!
“I’m gonna need to STAND UP for this one” ☄️
❤❤❤❤❤
I always was digging Juvey growing up …but this brings an entire level of respect for him and Manny!!! Is it me but would this not be an excellent Vegas residency for a year or two live and intimate like this! Shout out to some of the South’s Top OGs 💯🦾 🔥
He tipsy af 😂 but we understand we from the hood
Man he should’ve did bounce back man
I didn’t even know I needed this! 🔥🔥🔥
👏 *SOON… and I mean soon 😳 as I saw this I clicked it with ZERO 🙆🏾‍♂️ hesitation.* My youth, my teenage years, the memories, the friendships. Just wow. And I’m glad Manny Fresh was the musical director. 🗣 “LADIES & GENTLEMEN!”
Very talented skilled NOLA  boyz  go Manny Fresh and Juvenile’s
I love how hip hop is growing. I was at home getting it lol.
Absolutely! And long overdue. I thank you .
Mannie Fresh is so happy its contagious 😊
This is the music of my youth. While it's pretty obscene and definitely not in line with what is acceptable today it was a huge part of the zeitgeist of the late 90's and 2000's. It's cool NPR gave them an elevated and "unplugged" platform to bring strings and horns on to showcase the art in these songs.
started off with teh classic! 400 degreees omg  woooooooooooooooooooo
FiyyerrrrrrrRR! Juvenile, Manny Fresh and the live band?! I really enjoyed this
Need chief keef on there
The Tiny Desk I Never Knew I Needed.
For the 4x today……🎉🎉🎉🎉
Give Juvie his fu**in flowers dawg!!! One of the 🐐’s 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
This was fantastic 🎉🎉🎉
Wow this got beyond 🔥 lit.
Not a fan of NPR but this is straight 🔥
My tv volume on 💯  😆
Thank you for this!! 🙏🏻
I love this!!!❤🎉🎉🎉
This is the best one i seen big up to juvie the great he brought it 👏
Juvie sounds so good!! Mannie on the production was flawless!
Nola stand up
THIS IS WHAT I NEEDED  Working a 12hr nightshift and i was able to watch this during my break tonight!!! Juvie with the live BAND 🎉 manny and the singers ✅ and the participation from the audience 🔥 who ever approved of this segment needs a raise ✅ definitely worth the wait! Thanks NPR
😅🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
JUVENILE STILL GOT IT!!!!!!!!
Times like this I wish I worked at NPR... then again I'd probably get fired for being too lit
Swear I luv this man❤
I’m only 7 mins in & I can tell this is the best Tiny Desk Concert so far 👏🏾🔥 took me back to my childhood where I had no business listening to these songs 😭
I’m in TEARS!!  This was so good. I literally could feel the love and energy ‼️‼️ they need to go on a live tour
Juve always been under appreciated
Where is the person that time stamps all the songs lol
what time to be alive!!! and to have experienced this era!!! man what?!?
Magic 🔥
I was 10 again and havin no business singing these lyrics. This brought me back. 😊❤😊❤
This right here! NPR, I see you! Wow!
The best tiny desk I've ever seen. Legends at work.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Juve on Tiny Desk might be the most underrated and important move in Tiny Desk history. Him, the band and Mannie Fresh killed it
When I tell you I was partying so hard  this gave me life Best tiny desk hand down
Always love me some DJ Mannie Fresh and Juvie. Bring out that 504 brass baby ⚜️⚜️⚜️.
The best of times

Mannnnnnn this brings me back to my high school days. Living in the south I had all these cash money tapes/cds
You can tell Juvenile and Mannie Fresh genuinely was having so much fun with this Tiny Desk performance.
I needed this!!! One time for the culture!!!!
🗣 JUVEEEEEE!! Did what needed to be done!!! 🔥🔥🙌🏾 Even the 🏃🏾‍♂️ back was 🔥🤌🏾
We need one with lil Wayne
This has to be the best tiny desk performances ever. Salute to juvenile and Mannie fresh.
People may not realize this but think about it: Juvenile and Manny blew up the squad as the artist and producer. That gave birth to Lil Wayne to shine. Wayne took over. Wayne gave birth to Nicki Minaj and Drake who are two of the best ever. Juvenile's suceess created apipeline for others.
Tiny Desk will never be the same again Juvie The Great Baby ❤❤
This was the most fun music best times ever .....Thnks Guys..Amazing Band...
They absolutely need to bring Petey Pablo in next
The guy on the piano tho?? Who dat?! 😅

I'm glad you decided to be a part of tiny desk experience. You did that. Whoo Nah!!!
This was everything! 😭😭😭😂
The intersection of hood and pretentious is so palpable and perfectly illustrates the internal dialogue I am faced with every day. This is a tour de force!
Sweet nectar of the gods in the form of music 🤌🏽
COME ON MANNY!!!
I didn’t want it to end ❤❤❤❤
Living in New Orleans right now. Watching this, with the Essence Fest taking place right outside of my window is everything. The city is alive. Thank you for reppin home, Juvie. We love you. ⚜️⚜️⚜️

Whaaaaaat!!! How dope is this!!
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
You got court? ha  u kno who got tha fire green? Ha
I have never listened/watched npr besides skits mocking it. This was so Awesome and took me back to my high school days pumping juve/hot Boys. I was nervous when I say that they were doing a concert unplugged. It has been years since I have seen a live performance from them and they hit a grand slam and pitched a perfect game in the same game.They sound amazing.
Legendary tiny desk!!!!!!!!! Top 5 for sure
JUVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE this right here, WELL DESERVED . LOVED IT .......

Throwback to when I was wearin' FUBU!! Mannie look good, he looks the same. Dude w/ beard on bass is FINE!  and I had a crush on Juve back then, not so much now..but I'd still ask for an autograph if I saw him in the streets!
Excellent episode!!

NPR 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
That’s my favorite part of the song too (hot girl) and the audience asking for them to run it back 😂🙌🏾💯
That took me back! One of my favorite Tiny Desk!!!!
That's the livest  that I every saw the audience on Tiny Desk. They did that! 😁 🥳
Man I needed this!
Original CMB FOREVER 🙌👐🔥✊🔥
This was gospel
Watching this tonight while visiting New Orleans
Classic! Best Tiny Desk Concert I've seen so far.
This was black history!!
WOW!!!
Ayo that Juvenile n Mannie Fresh catalog is one of the coldest. They had hits for days. 🔥 🎤 🔊
Man I love my people and my city!!!!! Forever NOLA!!!!!!
This made my day 😊
This was exceptional!!!
❤
How many parents near 50 just outed themselves to their young children in shock as you turn this up!!
Turk and Wayne parts do getcha up and moving❤❤❤😊😊😊   Come on Purple!!!!!
Absolutely brilliant. Elevated classics to a level I never would have guessed. Great booking, NPR.
Juvie had so much fun…
Master P you up next
I wish Wayne was here
The base player 😍.
Put some respect on them hits
When they broke out into Rodeo I got a lil teary eye’d. Brought me right back to Spring 2006 lol long live Juvy
Juvi is severely underrated!
this music is perfect for tiny desk my opinion
the serotonin this gave me is crazzzyyy juvenile is a legend
He needs another 1! I more for the 400 Degreez album
Probably my favorite TD and I wasn’t even really a Juvie fan   Manny Fresh with the Midas touch
Man if we can get all the Hot Boys and Big Timers performing on the HIPHOP Awards for the 50th would be crazy 🔥💪🏾
This was everything…and an Encore!! Yoo.  I don’t think Usher got a encore(might be wrong)lol. Dynamic Due 🎉
This is why my back and knees dont work to this day!  For 28 minutes, I forgot and they suited up for this concert. THEN you bring in Trombone Shorty!!!!!  The BEST so far!
juvie killed it on my mama🔥🔥
Juvie so underrated
Get a stretch in 😂
Get your position!!! 😂😂 IKTR!!
Classic performance he killed it

Omg! Love this session with Juvie and Mannie Fresh. Took me back! This sounded so good
So blessed to have grown up listening to these men & now being able to see this masterpiece 5 days before my 20th bday. Bless
U got that fire green haaa
That 400 Degreez album is still one of my all time favorite albums to this day.
Realizing that Manny's "Oh's" weren't autotuned is blowing my mind. 🤯  This version of Slow Motion made realize how badly I need a Juve's Greatest Hits Second Line Edition in my life.😊
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥 💙 AYYYYYYYYYYYYEEE!!!!!

Maybe the BEST TINY DESK I'VE seen thus far!!!
This Tiny Desk about to hit A MILLI A MILLI A MILLI A MILLIIIIIII in a day!!!! 😍😍😍
One of the best tiny desk ever!!!!
A very well deserved encore!
I love how he represented his city with passion and great instruments and Grammy winners.  My favorite tiny desk so far.

8:00 HARDEST 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Good sh*t Tiny Desk, Juvenile did this sh*t, rappers take notes put some respect on his name my man reciting & remember everything he wrote no lip singing sh*t no pauses all raw talent homie got Cash Money on his back with this sh*t
This was Super Fresh🎉🎉🎉🎉😅
He seems to be in great spirits 😇
Man, everyday I love being Black, but it's moments like these where I love it a little more. This was incredible.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is brilliant.
Juvie still on point with the delivery and Mannie still on point with the adlids
From Babyface to Juvie and Mannie Fresh...  🔥
Taking me back to my teenage years and my 20s 💜🫶🏿
I love juvenile. This made me love him much more. It was nice seeing him and Manny Fresh together ❤. They didn’t come to play. I literally screamed when they bought out the violin and Chello. Juvenile, The Hot Boys, BG,Turk, lil Wayne,Birdman. That was my WHOLE young adult years. I loved this Tiny Desk performance ❤.
I don’t think there has been a tiny desk I wanted a 360 camera for more! I’d watch this 20 more times just so I could see the whole rooms reaction to this set especially the encore. This was fantastic!
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾LADIES AND GENTLEMEN GIVE IT UP!!!!
Oh this was 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Hip hop/rap music is made for LIVE MUSIC!!
This was brilliant!!!!!

Class of 2001! This was such a cool throwback. I don't listen to much rap today since Jesus is on his way but man, this was sooooo cool to remember my high school days. It's been over 15 years since I heard most of these but I still remember the music and Lyrics... goes to show how good music actually sticks with you. Salutes to you Juve, I see you with the JuveJuice can! (I just watched the interview that he just did with Eric, a wh1t3 reporter said "Back that thang up" I lost it!)
Omg yessssss Juvi!!!!!!!! Love it ❤
THIS WAS SOOOO GOOD! YOUTH ACTIVATED!!
Mr. Juvie, can you make an album with the strings, band, singers and of course Mannie Fresh. This is a classic baby. Proud to say I am from the NOLA.

Juvieeeee ⚜️🎶💜💚💛
I remember when Juvenile dropped 400 Degreez. I was in the Marines & in Hawaii & they played this in the club & everybody went crazy on the first time hearing it. You just knew it was special. 96 to 2000 some phenomenal music came out on the HipHop side/R&B side.
Doooppooeeeee AF 🔥🔥🔥
🤩Slow motion fo me🔥
Classical G code rap💪🏽😎.. thanks to all that participated to make this a reality.. great show whoadaes
Loved it🎉❤😊best so far

I should have been in There. Increase the Pay of the Event Planner
I didn't know I needed this, but thank you!
Omfg Juvi was autotune before autotune existed 😮
Hardest behind Uncle Charlie
This was so fun!
I always thought maybe Juve meant to say, "make something outta nothing " instead of " make nothing outta something " on Ha.   I've been praying to God for guidance on the matter since the 90's and he has not answered me yet.
Neva seen a crowd ask to run it bike this was 🔥
This hard 😂
One of the best tiny desks ever...
Effortlessly one of my top favorite Tiny Desk concerts. Perfection! Juvenile and Mannie Fresh KILLED this! Band and singers were just....*chefs kiss*. And an encore?!! Since when?!
The Tiny Desk I never knew I needed! Encore!
White guy in the audience….don’t be shy we know you know the song. Why are you hesitant?! Own that! 9:25

This new generation needs to take note, You gotta stop popping pills and sipping sizzurp cuz yall perform live over your track and perform 30% of the vocal, That's why so many artists are here today gone tomorrow the real money  And staying power is in touring And these new rappers live sets are trash

Took me back
I respect Juvie’s artistry so much more now. Always loved his music but to see the energy live, up close, AND I could hear and understand his lyrics better than before (those mics are outstanding). This is easily Top 5 Tiny Desks for me (including Big Daddy Kane and Rakim)
Yes Indeed! This was everything! 💯👏🏾👏🏾
That's right Juvy and Manny Freezy need an orchestra and a band to explain that! Best NPR ever❣️🥳💕🤩
Slow motion 🥰🥰🥰🥰
I've loved Juvi since college. Took a pic with him when he came to Club Elite in Hattiesburg, MS around 2012. Tiny Desk is SO great for this!!❤❤
Somebody get Shonda Rhimes  in here!! I know this would be so lit on the next Bridgerton series!
The fact that they let him curse in his songs make this dope
😅😅😅🔥🔥🔥🔥
I saw Juvenile live in South Padre Island..hit after hit

Best tiny desk concert ever. 🔥🏆🔥
Finally
Omg Top Tier Fire NPR the encore!!!!!! My 1st concert was cash money and ruff ryders watching this just awakened my 15 yr soul. There is no way I could’ve been working in studio that day cause I would’ve bent over dropping it and explaining myself to HR the next day.
AMAZING
Didn't know I needed this but just 🫡.. the miracle that i remember the songs, just nostalgia
Thank you.
The musical arrangement is awesome! Props to whomever decided on the horns...this was amazing
Enjoyed myself! Great T.D performance!!
Juvie coulda went for HOURS!!! He shoulda did G-Code!!!

FROM EVERY PART OF MY HEART THANK YOU TINY DESK
This man gotta be 50 or older and the breath control he still has is insane. He wasn't outta breath a single time. They don't make em like this anymore.

This is perfection 🔥 🔥
A breath of fresh air

This is the one.
This was amazing!!!
Definitely one of the top 5 T.D. concerts.

This is the greatest thing I’ve ever seen!
I am in the dmv area how can I get a invite to see this live!!!  I highly enjoyed this one!!!

Anyone thinking it's time for Cypress Hill to do their Simpsons bit for real now?
I loved this so much! I smiled the entire time💃🏽definitely one of my faves❤️
Cash Money got nothing but classics.💯
Juveline has been arrested 5 times. Drug charges, assault charges... was forced to pay 170,000 in back child support. Great choice for a role model NPR. Tax payer funded NPR... it would be great if you meffers would be forced to pay your own.
Classic
❤❤❤❤❤ this!!!!
13:25 inject it straight into my veins
As a native of NOLA this made my day it brings back so many memories of myself my brothers my friends attending live performances and the great times we had some of my crew are now deceased so it’s a very emotional experience loved it
400 degrees classic 😊

I never got into down south rap music cause my caribbean country bumpkin couldn't handle all the explicit lyrics but I always was fond of Juvenile's music. There was always some subtleness of comedy and joy.... ahahaha.     Beautiful, tiny desk!!! They did that. Joyous!!!
I would love to hear some more of many music

The world needed this.
This might be my first comment on ANYTHING in YEARS!! This was 🔥🔥🔥, nostalgic and reminds me of how much young, talented, hungry black youth take nothing and turn it into something legendary! NPR, thank you for letting our legends receive their flowers! 👊🏾💯🫡
Wanted to see Wayne do his verse at the enddddd... Would have been epic!

🙌🏾🙌🏾 thank you guys for a quick trip down memory lane
I need a moment to digest this masterpiece.  It's too much for one sitting. I'll compose myself and circle back for another listen when my mind is right.
If y'all don't represent Nola with the live music, i can't even describe how much this sums up Louisiana culture, all this cussing but making it sound classy. You can understand every word just southern classy
Who we nominate and where we send our nominations for npr employee/employees of the month because this whole series was spectacular ❤❤🔥🔥🔥💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾
This was life 😫🙌🏾
Love it
One of the top most derogatory & disrespectful rap groups where it concerns women of color! Every race have their set of hoes but I’ve never heard them making songs at such a level that degrades their women. I hated this era in so called music & all music like this to my core!!!!!!
Tiny Desk NEVER misses
The Amours sound amazing!!
Yesssss gave me life so many memories
This the best one ever no lie
Yall slick Tiny Desk. Save Juvie for the last day of Black Music Month!!!! Yeahhh!!! Thank you!!!
i smiled the whole time
Awesomeness ❤🎉

Run it upppppppppp let’s get a million views in 24 hours.
This is super dope!!
The best rap shows have live bands.

This concert feels good! The joy on the faces of Juvie and Mannie warms my heart. Some legends are often forgotten and never receive the flowers while they can smell them. 🖤💐  Kudos, gentlemen!
My heart smiles ❤
Interesting Great stuff!!!. Live music is great!.
yes!!!! for the culture!!!
I just got my entire life to this!! ❤ Thank you Juvie, Thank you Mannie and Thank you Tiny Desk!
Thank you thank you thank you! I needed this! Brought back memories from when I was in my 20s….❤❤
So good!
💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽
From Juvenile's energy and vocal control, to Mannie's energy and improv( ex: vocoder on 400 Degreez & playing instrument from "Go D.J" on "Ha"), to the Band's awesome play & balance between smooth/hype sounds ("Slow Motion", "I Need a Hot Girl"); this was A1 musicianship!  The Amours rendition of "Rodeo" was smooth and Jon Baptiste and Trombone Shorty added their flavor as well. The Louisiana Philharmonic had that the clean sound and Mannie and Juve brought it home. The crowd did their thing too. Shoutout to Tiny Desk.
Fire..... Now get Weezy on there!!!
What a super dope unexpected bonus! 🙏♥️🔥
yooooooooooooooooooo
Forget buying arena tickets let me book a flight and head to the Tiny Desk Concert Series!! 😂

Thank you NPR!!!!!!! Juve, Manny, the band, A1 from beginning to end!!!
THIS!!!! YESSSSS Thank you to whomever put this together, this was amazing! Brought back so many good memories,  I was missing Juvenile. He doesn't get enough recognition for my taste. Even from other artists I hear them thank everyone and or mention everyone from this time but Juvenile
If ever there was a song that required an encore, I couldn't think of a better one than this.
I love the end so much love
And I have to say this, out of all the wonderful singers and talented musicians. This is the first tiny desk performance where the audience asked for the artist to perform a song twice! Lol.

Incredible. All it needed was Lil Wayne coming out of nowhere at the end singing "drop it like it's hot" over and over. Maybe the only good thing Twitter has ever been responsible for.

Easily the best Tiny Desk I’ve ever seen, encore and all. This millennial New Orleans girl was breaking it down and smiling at her desk for 28 minutes!! 💜💚💛
These two should NOT even be allowed to perform anymore after that ridiculous "Vax that Thang up" song and video 🙅🏾‍♂️ I guess people really will do anything for money 🤦🏾‍♂️
Nothing like listening to the live instruments. Everyone looks good, sounds good. Mehhhhnnnn this was sooooo gooood!!
It's the tambourine for me!!! 😂 The band playin Hot Girl! Rodeo! Project chick! This is brilliant and so N.O.!!!
Let’s talk about the ladies the Amours!!! I was yelling go ahead girllsss! Beautiful voices

This was a 2 in1 for me. We got Juve and Mannie Fresh. Mannie was the mastermind behind the Cash Money machine.
Mannie Fresh 🫡🫡🫡 “legend
This was perfect ❤
This is my wedding reception will look and feel like. Mark my words.
Let's just keep in mind they had so many artists on here that have come after juvenile....... not just in hip hop but across genres. He's been in the game longer than some of the artist featured have been alive. Yall have had adele, anderson paak, megan the stallion, Trina, ari lennox, jazmine sullivan, summer walker and countless others and this man has been giving us hits since BEFORE 1999....like 25 years. While I appreciate the love now I just want yall to be mindful of the oldheads that's been doing this not just popular trending artists. I truly appreciate yall having juvenile, Charlie wilson and babyface.
This was so 🔥
Yoooooow 🎉🎉🎉🎉 fire 🔥
STAND THE F UP! An ENCORE????? Hands down because of that, the best one to date!
Jesus died and rose again for your sins. Believe in him and you will be saved and go to heaven!

Happy Black Music Month 2023!❤️🤍💙❤️💚🖤🤎

TOP 5 NPR Tiny Desk. Juvenile. Instant Classic
Maaane Juvenile the Great has always been on my top 15 best artist list.. I think he  get the props deserve but he still don't get the props he  Deserve! 400degrees!!!!
This is not a good representation of black music, let alone a good representation of black people or America as a whole. It's funny how more socially aware we are today yet lyrics like these are celebrated and called "good music". Trust me, I know I'm in the minority but make it make sense.
So good!!!
He really did an encore! Shout out to my city New Orleans and Juvie!
We really real musicians in New Orleans I don’t think people understand this in our blood hands down best tiny desk concert fasho 💎
I’m sad I wasn’t there. This is amazing
Yooooo. This was incredible. I just needed “Ha” all the way through.   Manny doubled up that “That was that nerve ha?” ✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
Band members look like they going to school at 1331 Kelerec St. IYKYK NOLA 💯

All these hits are STILL in heavy rotation here in Texas, Louisiana, HBCUs, and the third coast from my college days in the 90s. Please show more love to band these artist bring too! As a drummer, to play in a tight spot and deliver on the breaks and fills, awesome!!! I'm renewing my yearly donation to my local NPR. Please do the same!!😊
This is Awesome. Such a throwback and great memories
Come on Manny and Juvenile. Very talented
One thang bout Louisiana we gone cut every where we go 😂😂

Yassss
I’ve been waiting and watching for this one
Yasss I love it!🔥🔥
I needed this!!!!
Love this. Legendary performance by a couple of hip hop legends and their bandmates. I can't help but think about their band and the fact that those younger guys and gals grew up listening to Juvenile and Mannie. It's probably so much fun, as a younger musician, to get to perform with these guys. Everyone, including NPR, killed it with this one.
✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾
NPR just keeps on keeping on..! I have yet to be disappointed!❤
Ayyyy! Man tiny desk just went up a few points with this one. 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉

If you from the south this Tiny Desk performance meant everything. Juvie and the Hot Boys are living legends and this didn’t disappoint 🙌🏾🙌🏾
Juve understood the assignment, legends.  He brought the heart of the Cash Money sound.  DJ Manny, Fresh Fresh a Freaky Fresh.  Salute to both of you.  It really would have been a shocker if you could have brought out Turk boy 🔥🔥.   Either way one of the best tiny desk I’ve seen.  👏🏽🙌🏽👏🏽🙌🏽💯💯

I love the live band version of his music. Tiny Desk doesn't disappoint with the range of artists they bring to the desk. Please, never stop. Now that I'm in my 40's, it brings me joy to still revisit "old school " music with a new sound.

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This what happens when you get the stimulus 💰💰💰 to bring in black artists. They need us but again we helping them build there empire and not our own. How about supporting black small businesses such as the ‘Open Mic Studio Series’. But other than my rant. They should Re-record his greatest hit live just like this and remarket it🤷🏿‍♂️
This did my soul so good. I was 10 when Juvie’s music came out 😂 but I love it just the same!
The South was on fire when this dropped!
❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Incredible. More of this. More.
I'm jamming at work !!!

The perfect ending to Black Music Month!
NPR sees the country coming for the culture heavy and gave a much needed REPRIEVE to close out Black Music Month RIGHT!!!! Appreciate this platform soooooooooo much! Give Juvie and Mannie their FLOWERS & RESPECK!!!!
June 30th will now be known as "Juvie Day" from here on out. This made my year.

What part is 400 degrees?
THANK YOU TINY DESK. YOU KNOW WHATS UP
I remember being a kid in 1998 listening to this 400 Degreez album. My father would take the tape from me and tell me that I wouldn’t be able to listen to it. Because of the explicit content. But I was a kleptomaniac. So I went to the record store down the street from my house and stole another copy of it. No one could deny me from listening to 400° Album.
I woke up and seen Juvies name on tiny desk and had to watch this instantly. What an amazing performance by him featuring Mannie Fresh the jazzyness goes so well with this
Love the band!!👏🏽
Man I woulda been no more good if turk came out and did his part
I had to start rapping with the crowd on slow motion 😂😂😂
What is Juice drinking?
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Classic.
Maaaannnn. Sometimes you dont know certain things were needed until they happen. This was one of those moments... Raises to all the staff who made this possible.
This made me smile grew up off that CMR: 24 years ago me, and my friends on lunch break London City ya know.
Who would've thought...this is so dope & authentic
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
🤸🏽‍♀️🤸🏽‍♀️🤸🏽‍♀️🤸🏽‍♀️🤸🏽‍♀️

Northerners are so stiff and conservative. We cut up down south. Camera or not.
Yassssssssssss! Stand up New Orleans! Juv the Great!
Juve was snappin🔥
THIS WAS EVERYTHING. WHOEVER MADE THIS POSSIBLE DESERVES NOTHING BUT THE BEST. THE NOSTALGIA. THE MUSICALITY OF IT. Juvenile, Mannie Fresh (the whole Cash Money/Big Timers/Hot Boyz) was such an explosive era and really expanded lens of rap. It was so essential for the evolvement of the genre. This was everything. I miss this. And Juvie + Fresh still got it
JUVIE DA GREAT!!!!!! LEGEND 👑
Come on Juvie!!!! Represent the Boot!!!!!
OMFG I broke my knees on that encore. Bravo, Bravo, BRAVO!
Great way to close out black music month. Thank you, tiny desk.
Yesssss!!!
This was EVERYTHING!! I am a huge fan of the original Cash Money so I knew every word and couldn’t stop tapping my feet and pointing my fingers at my desk!! Juvieeeee!!
Dude behind Mannie Fresh at 26:47 hiding his face... He probably used a sick day to go to this concert 😂
This how you finale the month!! Juvee and Fresh with the band plus the Amore’s 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Why doesn't this NPR have more likes! What a LEGEND!

I was raised off juvi
I don't normally comment on YouTube videos, but this is quite simply one of the best things I've heard in awhile.  The muted trumpet, guitar and keys on "Slow Motion" sounded great, and then the audience sing-along + unmuted trumpet for the chorus just sent me
L E G E N D A R Y!!!!!!
Lord, y'all have me twerking at 9 in the morning 🤣💃🏽  Brought back memories from high school and college.  I can still drop it like it's hot 🔥 😛
