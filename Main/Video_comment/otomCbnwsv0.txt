My Pixel 8 pro coming tomorrow ❤😊
I have the Pixel 8 pro, i love it, the storage could have been bigger but thats just me with all the photos and videos i take XD
If some ai features like the call screening and the blog summarise come to the EU, then im happy🎉
such a diverse phone! *throws up*
Almost every phone at Flipkart has Bajaj Finserv EMI option, but Google Pixel doesn't. Is it helping Google to profit more?
Are you planning to do something with the PWM frequency? Too bad Google has the lowest value against the competition these days..... My eyes are suffering....
Got the google pixel 8 pro not gonna lie this phone is fire and the thermometer is also an amazing thing
Keep wach on price deop
I ❤❤❤❤ Google and my Google Photos date back as far as the YEAR 2023 ONLY
There is a community that heavily relies on raw performance, then there are iPhone lovers then there are Pixel tech nerds like me, proud to be a Google Pixel user since the 4a
As a photographer I am nervous about ai 😕
Got the Google pixel 8 and I love it
S 36TH ST
5G Not working on Sri Lanka
🎉
Watched the trailer to see what else my Pixel 8 could do NOW I USE THE VPN NETWORK
Ironic: "Less distracting audio" and then they use mind-numbing noise music as the background track to the ad.
Please beware of this phone! This phone is not tested and carries many fatal mistakes! The biggest problem I encountered is: Noises appear after about 10 minutes of the call! A fatal problem, read about it💡
Cool post ! Does the pixel 8 pro support usb devices with exFAT protocol ?
please improve processor
WHY NOT A FORCE FULL SCREEN OPTION FOR THE APPS?  I've bought this phone and there are so many apps and games I can't enjoy full screen...  I've bought a 6.7 inch screen phone, not a 6.2...  Any other brand has this option Google...😢
Im gonna buy it tomorrow!!
Bought 3 but we’ve returned them, no charger, lower quality package for a premium price. Got the oneplus 12, premium package, wooden case, more memory, £200 cheaper
This is by far the sh*test phone i ever had. If there would be an option to get my money back i would use it for sure. Its like the phone is the "bug" by itself. As if Google would be hard working to make as many bugs as possible. If that was the goal, then well done G, you did it. The problems come from every single piece of the phone. Starting with the device restarts by itself, the gps looses the signal. If you happen to start driving from the underground garage, the gps wont find the signal even with you exit the parking to outside.  With the gps, for the device to actually start navigating, it will take it good 30 seconds for it to recognise the direction you moving to. Iphone does the same in 1-2 seconds. Why is this so bad? Most of the AI features are either useless or hard to use, they were good for marketing but have nothing to help with the usability. Majority of the apps are buggy too. Its like if they would not validate the apps build for the platform at all. Add here the troubles using google pay. Each time there is no guarantwe it will work. Avoid. Given the price is not cheap at all, avoid this device. Its terrible.
Rear Camera design is the best part of a Android phone. Google is blind here and I think they have forgotten their Esthetics of Phone Camera Design. I hate Google Pixel Camera design from the core of my heart.
Google should change Pixel Camera design. They should follow Samsung Galaxy Z Fold Camera design.
Hi Google, I love pixel phones, but in my country, if the phone breaks, there is no service center to fix it.... So how do I get it? It would be nice to have a good solution for this.
Why Hong Kong has no to buy?
Thanks for the update on my pixel which ruined my whole phone and, I hope you assholes are happy. BECAUSE I AM NOT.
🤬🤬🤬 android
Google pixel 9 pro  system  fuchsia os
This stupid ad keep playing on my YouTube not nonstop. I am a pixel 7 user and this make me HATE pixel now!
Samsung users: We have the best phone Google users knowing that they have the same features with a smaller price: 💀
I see this ad consecutively, 10x a day for the past week. If I see that first girl sway to the side one more time, I'm gonna kill myself.
Google pixel 9 pro and pixel 8 pro  Are both awesome phones to buy in 2024
False advertisement. Not many important Ai features work in other countries than the U.S
Pixel is my fav and day to day phone, I have tried Samsung and iPhone, But Nahhh, I will say Pixel is the new era phone love you Google ❤
I'm still using a Pixel 4a, and it's been the most reliable phone I ever had. Someday when it dies I'll definitely get another Pixel. Likely a year-old model to save money.
Google

What pixel offers? (Pixel 8 pro) *overheating ✓ *Slowest charging 3+ hours ✓ *Sorry we can't (answer from any issues from Google customer service) ✓ *Poor performance    The phone is good for 10minute of camera use (overuse can bring the temperature at 45°C!) Can use it as a thermal device in extreme cold weather where the temperature is usually below 5°C  Lastly: OVERPRICED! (& STILL doesn't support to solve the main issue which is overheating!) ✓   Will never ever think about Google phones😅
If Google improves the PWM, this is going to be the best pixel phone ever
Всял pixel 8 в черном цвете
Clear all button should be under the first app you want to close not all the way left and the three navigation buttons should be have the option to have back button on the right like OnePlus 11
I believe it's high time we had our own version of iMessage, enhancing continuity within the google ecosystem. Imagine the ease of seamless messaging across devices! Make it happen, Google! #GooglePixel #MessagingRevolution 💬🚀
#143 GOOGLE PIXEL 8 Pro 😂🇮🇩 (Beliin Lah)
Very nice ❤️
😂
Is all this stuff good for the Pixel 7 because that's what I have. I bought that when it came out. I'm not going to buy another pixel with the next problem here. I might get the Pixel fold 2 . I'm not sure yet. I might ride this pixel 7 out for two more years
PLEASE SELL IN MALAYSIA IM WILLING TO GET A PIXEL 8 PRO
@madebygoogle magic editor is "not on phone" it doesn't works without internet photo is backed up on server and editing is done from server it's treachery to the users who paid for pixel 8 pro I am one of the user
Apa sudah ada di pasar indonesia?
From nothing to something 😊
TWA hotel JFK.. great filming location!
Please make your products officially available in the Philippines! There are a lot of Pixel users here! #TeamPixel
Very Disappointed that it's 2024 and Google is still not providing Dual Physical Sims
Google not releasing Pixel phone and having stores in PH is a missed opportunity. whoever VP in sales and marketing should review their strategy
So many cool features but many of them are Pro only and most of them are region locked to the US. Google sees no need to mention it of course! Pixel 8 experience outside of the US is _nothing_ like what is being shown here.
On a besoin un peu de jeux vidéo aussi j'ai un pixel 6 pro je ne peux même pas jouer 😢😢😢😢un optimisation du puce pour qu'on puisse jouer un peu
Nice
한국인으로서 정말 좋아 보여요!!
I have an iPhone 14 Pro Max, but I’m really curious about the Pixel 8 Pro, it’s seems like it would be almost the perfect phone but can compete normally with the last iPhones, the first reason I want change is because iPhone can’t permit me (for a bad error) to do an iPhone backup with usb cable on Windows with iTunes, Apple told me to do a purchase of iCloud 200gb and after erase all data and test again if Windows make that problem again, so it does, I can’t resolve this problem and I’m obliged to spend 2,99€ every month for save my backups, but on Macs I can do the backup, so on their product yes but in other products no-Apple I can’t, bad move and not trustworthy, I’ll change with Pixel
Very nice great
I like 0:10 to 0:12 part ❤
Nice to meet you Google Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 pro
I brought the pixel 8 pro 2 months back and it heats up alot ...i was in love with the phone features but with such weak chip and throttling issues I've probably stop using it ...being a pixel fan ..it important for us to say this as a consumer that please use a competitive chipset which can handle such load with ease and also improve the charging speed ...it becomes very difficult for workers like us ...the speed is very very slow...hopint the google will take it as constructive feedback and work on it
Google plz improve the battery
😍
Schlechtes Design
Pixel smartphone Night Video are very noisy in low night condition compare to iPhone or Samsung
please sell in Turkey
camera is all about capturing the moment as it is , so why the hell would anyone one want to make it so artificial. This phone is for school kids.
I wanted to buy a pixel 7, due to the spamming publicity of the pixel 8... I will buy a Xiaomi thank you Google!
Please make Google Pixel phones  available in the Philippines!❤
It will be great if Google launch the 8 pro with 256gb in the colour bay in India..hope it will come soon..
Hey Google. When will Pixel officially launch in Malaysia?
does video boost only available in 8pro or is it also available in 8?
Google Give me a pixel 8 pro 😅😊
Hey Google    thank you so much for this❤
I switched! Pixel 8 Pro & Pixel Watch 2 combo. #TeamPixel all the way. After 13 years of being an Apple fanboy.
Gente no compren pixel 8 pro fuera se USA es un robo pantalla bloqueada en srgb en plena 2023 no es 10 bits, pero graba en esa calidad. Todo bloqueado por no vivir en gringolandia apesar de ser versión unlock. Lentísimo para hacer fotos y los arreglos literalmente puede ir al baño y volver y aun esta procesando. Se calienta es un ridículo. Vergüenza peor que apple.
AI camera... can I do a feature request? When you go to a museum, Akiba or Nakano, chances are the things you wanna shoot are behind a glass, and the reflection can get a lilo annoying. AI removing reflections, this would be a "take my money" feature for me tho...
pixel 6 has the best design, with each new pixel model the design gets worse(
I'm using pixel 7 pro and the portrait mode too bad. Google have to fix that we know thy can do it. Literally my friends pixel 3 portrait is better then pixel 7 pro portrait
Tengo el pixel 6 su optimización es bastante buena pero a veces pienso que si tuviera un Snapdragon sería un completo monstruo a toda capacidad.
One day after using the screen when completely black and was not functional. Had to return it and waiting on replacement. I've been without a phone for two days.
The pixel 7 pro was more premium than pixel 8 pro for its boxy design & sharp corners. I don't like the rounded corners of 8 pro & still pixel phones haven't much gaming power(throttling issue)
Crazy the world has gotten so comfortable with *fake* .....now we'll definitely never know what's real anymore.
Since the Pixel 8s got launched earlier this month, starting from the launch event itself, I have tried to watch all the first impression/review videos by YouTubers I know of. Reason – I was planning to upgrade to Pixel 8 Pro from Pixel 4a. I'll wait.    The price has gone up. First and foremost justification could be their promise of 7 years of all kinds of software supports. I'm not exactly convinced by that though. Anyway. I'm an Indian consumer and I totally understand that Google is trying to get into the Indian smartphone market very cautiously, since they're very much aware of how sensitive that is. Bearing that in mind this much of price hike is surprising, at least to me. Anyway Indian consumers have to pay more than what it turns out after USD to INR conversion. That's understandable to some extent, as there're various factors behind it. And at the same time it brings little bit of respite thinking it's not as MORE as what one has to spend for iPhone 15 series!    Google's apparent cautiousness about Indian market is likely to be the reason behind not launching a 256GB version of 8 Pro. However, there're other problems. At least they look like so to me. I never thought of spending INR 100k on a smartphone. Now the fact of the matter is I love Pixel. I was already trying to convince myself while getting to know about  leaks and all, despite the probable price hike.   They focused very much on camera and photos and videos, or to put it in another way – they WANT us to particularly focus on those things maybe. These days, they keep adding camera hardwares little too frequently , which is not so Google thing though. Their current portrait mode is yet to catch up with what it used to be earlier, one that was last found in Pixel 6a. I think all of us know this. Reason – apparently the coupling of frequently upgraded hardware and software are not that polished as of yet, since when they stopped using that old IMX sensor post 6a era. I'm all for hardware upgradation. But I do definitely want the experience to go in the forward direction only. Latest portrait mode does not.    I'd want best cell reception, improved battery life, improved biometric – as in, all those basic things from a price-hiked INR 100k smartphone. Pixel 8s don't do justice to them. Their modem is old. Their fingerprint sensor is still not ultrasonic. These things matter when I'm planning to purchase that pricey a smartphone! Can't compromise on these things while spending that much of money. It's AI, AI and AI all the way though. Magic eraser is really helpful · be it for photo or audio. I fail to find many practical use cases where people would want to make use of that Magic Editor thing very often. I heard, they included this thermometer sensor in light of the recent pandemic and could not leave it at the last moment. Impractical per se. Had the pandemic been still going on in full swing, I don't know how wise an idea this is to slap a thermometer sensor at the back of a cell phone, provided it's not as reliable as it's supposed to be and they totally knew about this 'awating FDA approval ' thing. Isn't this borderline ridiculous!   Pixel has got things that nobody else has. But it's still not the most reliable choice yet, let's get this straight. iPhone is, by now. If I'm to spend INR 100k, that too with those visible flaws that one shouldn't get away with – probably it'll be wiser to spend more and go for iPhone. Much reliable.   I'll wait for another year. Will see how 9s look. Not convinced by all these marketings for 8s, not at all. Meanwhile, my Pixel 4a battery has aged and the picture of after-sales services of Pixels, in India, is not so promising as of yet. However, I'm not giving up on my favourite smartphone brand/series, not as of yet. Will see.
Pixel 8 also should has Promode camera because it is just a software, why you cut it off
You've made almost the best smartphone in the world. Use Snapdragon 8 gen ... chip and your product will be the champion forever
It looks great but since I received my 8 pro I don't see this to be in any way better than my 7 pro. This is why I never sent my 7 pro to trade in. Even though the photo quality I get on 7 pro seems to be better.
Love the grey color surely will buy the grey variant, love pixels.
The best phones are Google ❤
Whoa. The AI features make the pixel 8 the best Android phone. But I would like to say that I liked the boxy rectangular design of pixel 7 series.
I love this pixel 8 pro. Excellent phone. Why do you send a free device out to all these people? Reviewer's. When most of them are apple fans. There is no comparison between Google and Apple. Apple is for no common sense people. They always talk crap about your devices. Send them to people who love android and maybe we can get a real review. I love the new pixel line up and I paid for them.
Can't use the 5x telephoto lense for portrait. Which is frustrating. How could you guys do this on a thousand dollar phone? This is a really basic thing for any smart phone nowadays. I'm regretting after buying the pixel 8 pro
Pixel 8 e  Pixel 8 Pro muito bom 👍👍🤓  Very good 👍👍🤓
😮What with the price GOOGLE Rs:1,06,999 for 12GB -128GB variant 🫷No Way anyone buying this phone. 7 years updates means nothing when photos and videos gonna fill than 128Gb in a year or so...😔😔😔Disappointment of the Year for US Indians Android Fans.
Who peoples what to make a photo into a a fake pic?
Please sir can you change the tensor chip..  everyone insulting google phone... No one says it is good for the price .. I want to buy this phone .. the review of this phone is very bad.. how can I buy it for the game.. I need the ultimate package in  one mobile...
🔥
Actually, after trying the Google Pixel 7a phone. Google phones do not rise to the level of Apple phones at all! You will feel stupid android if you have used Apple before. Add that the touch resolution on the screen is less than the iPhone.  I can say that Google phones are excellent according to the price. If it's half the price of an iPhone from Apple, I recommend the purchase. Other than that, Apple phones cannot be compared to Google. Apple above the sky and Google in the middle.  Apple's phones are thoughtful and tested, and there is no mistake and an excellent user experience, without a doubt. Google's phones made many mistakes and a stupid system compared to Apple phones.  If the price is of interest to you, buy a Google, if it is of interest to you, buy an Apple. In short, there is no comparison at all.
I love this phone. Never gets hot now. The screen is so nice to touch. Amazing work Google. Can't wait to get the new pixel fold 2
I received my pixel 8 pro last thursday, its really amazing!
Oppssss.......😮 Google have taken ai too seriously !!!!!!

I like it because the design is completely different from other mobile phones.Most intelligent phone ever!
@madebygoogle  What have you done to fix the audio recording in videos for live music?  The Pixel 7 Pro was shockingly bad - useless, in fact. Whereas even the Pixel 3 was inpressively good.
Hmmm  Price: not bad Quality: very good Better than iphone 15???? YEAAA
If it was snapdragon 8+ gen 1 Or gen 2 That will be even much more greater!
Please solve camera issue of lags on Instagram stories and other thirdy party apps when zooming in and out...there Is a very noticeable lag also on thirdy party apps like whatsapp, Telegram...please upgrade something on android 14 to force devs to Better integrate sensors, at least on pixel phones.
Hey google who is the girl who we see talk all the time?
Amazing phones ruined by the senseless bundle offers. Would rather prefer a discount. I received my P8 Pro with Watch and returning them soon as I got them. The watch is not a smartwatch. It cannot see who is at Nest Doorbell or reply , cannot unlock Nest locks and not see pictures on Gmail/Whatsapp. How is that a smartwatch? Its is just a glorified Fitbit tracker. With sadness and heavy heavy heart I return the gorgeous Bay P8 Pro now and will wait for a better offer from Google to buy it again.
tell me the soundtrack please
Just got the Google pixel 8 pro, love it🥰
Kindly release officially in Malaysia with good after sales service support (make it on par with Samsung, Huawei and Apple).
Why are you change the display design?  It kills premiumness.
Dear google, please increase the photos a little bit more saturated & vibrant.
Please move also the market here in the Philippines, there are a lot of buyers here when it comes to phone products
I am a Samsung lover but now i can feel the cravings for Google Pixel ❤
Google needs to make their phones look premium and not like a greek's toy with a geeky name. Maybe call the phone Marble. Use the colors of Mabel. Add some tiny airtags and and premium earbuds. And foldable or scrollable phone and a laptop like Lenovo yoga book fold. Team up with a fashion house for a deep designs imbedded in the software and hardware. And you got yourself a title continder 🏆
You have to add more  to the charger so it can charge faster!!
Got my Pro today! The very first day it came to Europe. Changing from 6 pro to 8 pro. In blue. Love it ✌🏻
I only wish you would have made the Pro model once also in the 6.2 inches size! :)
Please bring the Pixel to Brazil😭
Amazing!!👏👏 With huge expectations here from Portugal 🫶
Masuk ke indonesia donk
Apple will come out with the same features in iPhone 16 next year and add a " i " before every tool and claim it revolutionary lmao
Pixel in Brazil, please.
Why is display port alt mode still not enabled. Why have you consistently disabled it via hardware. I don't understand why you take functionality away.
❤
Kenapa tidak di masuk resmi Indonesia
Google needs to target foreign market if they want to succeed
We need Google Pixel to come to Indonesia now!!
Can I havea free sample, please??
Can I have a free sample?
Hi All, if you are using Jio sim in pixel mobiles in India beware of this issue. https://youtu.be/SIrBiNdoM08?feature=shared
not available in the Philippines, :(
got P8 pro otw but why can't I get 14 on my P7
First time I love pixel best than pixel 2 and 7 pro
What about like the Halloween features?
The check in feature is 100% apple😂 also the loud noise cancellation on calls…. 1:22    But I’ll make piece with it and consider this phone
I am a student and I am using Pixel 4a I really love it. I think this is a great invention with AI. Love it
If these are mostly software magic. Will these be available on Pixel 7 phones too?
Pro should be $500 max. Its a slab
Log Format for Video?
How much price in uae i want pixel 8 pro
CAN'T WAIT for that thermometer! HOW DID YOU KNOW?!?! BTW.... 7 years of updates? So how many times and how much $$$ to replace the battery?
Others: we have best camera, we have shake control. Le google: 0:41
Wow finally getting rid of the edge screen 🥲🥲🥲🥲
Loved the design of Pixel 8Pro ❤
We're close to jarvis at this phase
0:10 not that stable. :V
Google: Magic Editor, Magic eraser  Also Google: It's Not Magic, It's AI.
Is hold for me available in UK??? I'm Interested in the Pixel phone...
The fact that it doesn't have some kind of better unlocking mechanism (ultrasonic fingerprint or better face ID) is a deal breaker. I will pay whatever it costs once they add that.
As a tech-enthusiast and someone who keeps an eye on the developments in the industry, I can say the following:  It is absolutely wonderful to witness Google adopt a realistic and grass-roots level approach.  I would love to get this phone to review it as my first in-depth review of a phone and provide useful as well as deep insights to Google.  Catch up with me if it is possible, please :)  PS:  Pro-Tip:  For the next iteration or release, I would expect comprehensive information about AI, Graphics and Processor specifications and how they compare with other phones. The next pitch should be to essentially integrate the two ideas: Google phones are made differently, and how they just keep getting better by-design to aid and improve the consumer during their daily routine. I would love to explore this concept in future collaborations.
Remember the time when Stadia was supposed to take over the gaming world? Or when those AR glasses were going to revolutionise human contact? but y’all seriously believe that this company will give you 7 years of update just cuz they said so. This is google ffs, they abandon projects and promises on a whim.
😂😂😂😂😂
What about translations? And updates?
Ye, google pixel camera will never be defeated
Google pls bring your products in Greece!
How diverse and inclusive... so brave, so brave.
Waiting for google 20 pro
Desperately waiting
Bunch of copycats
I used Pixel 6a all good only problem hitting issue and fast drain battery otherwise top class phone   I amazed new pixel 8/8 pro 7 years os update 😲 really good job GOOGLE   LOVE FROM INDIA 🇮🇳
I Love Pixel Phones
DoodLE !!! how much is it? will u sell it in Turkey?
Apple: we have an usb c port now...
GOOGLE phones get hot like oven in high tenperature climate, please make heat lesser from pixel 8 onwards
Google pixel 8 Vs Google pixel 8 pro video please 🥺🥺🙏
Stealing data is your thing hence you are good at AI
Oh man Google has been solving problems for such a long time but this time with this device in just 2 minutes I was so amazed 😭 it looks so good too
Exonus remove Please ❤❤😢😢
Perfectly awaited phone to upgrade from my samsung s9 this one has Excellent, cameras,amazing battery,amazing performance ,excellent software support , and affordable what more can you ask?😍
No PAL video settings how can they call it Pro for anyone outside North America
Just bring pixel to Philippines or at least enable 5G! please! pleaseeeee! 😭
All perfect, but to big for my taste. So it’s a no, unfortunately.
Excellent 👌
I’m kind of thinking about getting a pixel the improvements over the years have been astounding props  to you guys
The google pixel 8 pro comes with the g3,improves the battery and the latest is android 14. this is sick😎😎😎
PERIODT GOOGLE, Y'ALL ARE SLAYING SO HARD THAT I AM WRITING THIS FROM HEAVEN. *SLAAAAAAAAY.* 💅🏾
I love  Google phones 🩷 especially your software so clean and simple 😍
O azul é muito lindo,  deveria lançar no Brasil. The BLUE is so beautiful, came to Brazil.
Rate High so sad
Any chance of an official release in Malaysia?
I wonder what would happer if google pixels had features like Samsung Routines and Goolock stuff. I would buy this over any device as it is now.
Sales Numbers are crazy, even surpassing Apples Sales im some areas, wow impressive Google !
I will buy
I just bought Pixel 7😢
price increase👎👎👎
Is it just me or the photos shown don’t look that good?
Among us. Blue is sus
What do you recommend for users that like the Pixel 4a, but find its size to be at or slightly above what they can use comfortably?
Only curved screen makes unique and premium for pro models, I hate pro screen design even 6 pro and 7 pro are better feel
There should be Curved screen at Google pixel 8 pro, why flat screen is like simple pixel 8
If they had better battery life , faster charing and more VALUE .. google would dominate the market easily. But they don't know how to put a phone together well.
Capture to the cosmos, great for capturing UAPs  7 years of os updates
Meanwhile Apple introduces USB-C lol
Honestly f**k the phone cameras!!  I don't understand why 90% of all reviews are about the camera.
Finally  a worthy competitor to Iphone 15 pro max
Amazed by the AI magic of Google Pixel 8 pro !
Please Google please, work on a Pro-model with the smaller size of the non-Pro model. Not everyone wants such a big smartphone 😅
I've got a 7P and I'm struggling so see the difference. That said it's the best phone I've ever had, if only it has screen casting.
In my point of view, Google has involuted in terms of the design of the Pixel line, compared to the first releases in the series that had a more premium design and seemed to be moving in that direction.
Google making smart phones smart again #Bard 2024 🎉
Love It
J'aime la façon dont les informations sont présentées comme celle-ci 💛.
Why are you not selling in Malaysia? 😢
❤️💛💙💚
Wow built in vpn 😘
I wish google support Middle East by affording full services and hardware
still going to stick with apple thanks
love it but i hate the fact of resell value, that de only downside in my country which is hard
Is 7a   better  than the 7 ??
The trade in values for pixel 7 pro are so low, google should be embarrassed
Google must enable VPN service  for Myanmar.
Great job Google this year with so many new features, lot better than Apple's miniscule updates to their models each year!!
Gonna wait for review love my s23 as hell but the camera isnt as good as my pixel 6 was in terms of fast shooting and colors that said as a phone he is way better than the 6 was. expecting a lot from the 8 lets see!
The whole first 60sec is for camera/photo, 55sec after is for everything else. What are you, a camera device? Idk why all mobile phones are on the run of cameras, it's supposed to be a smart device, not a camera :frustrated:
Google needs to build top notch quality laptops too. Like how apple products have culture of laptops, phones, watches. Similar to that culture google needs to build it. I would love to buy that set from Google.
This looks nice! Love the Bay!
No 256GB storage variant for 8 pro. Pixel 9 pro will have what? 64 GB storage?
好帥  APPLE再繼續擠牙膏阿 廢
Please Google future pixel 9a, 9, 9pro jack 3.5 please !!!!!!
I just got my pixel 7 🥲
The Google Pixel 8 doesn't have USB Type C Alternate Mode DisplayPort enabled.  Really!!!  DisplayLink is a horrible alternative.  I guess Mishaal Rahman's post on X was wrong.  No worries.  Saves me money.. I am not buying the Pixel 8 camera.  Besides, I bet Google has done ZERO work on Android Desktop mode and resizable windows in Android 14.
My next one
How can i buy it in morocco?
cannot buy in Türkiye. 😐

You haven't shown a good up close slow motion capture of the phone itself! Why plus the consumer wants to know if you finally gotten rid of a curved display because nobody liked it the only reason I didn't get a pixel pro is because of the handicapped curved display that's why I opted for the pixel 7 instead of the pro so you make an introduction video and all you do is show people taking pictures of them themselves it's pathetic it's f****** pathetic what? It's pathetic😢
Wow, the new Google #Pixel8 and Pixel 8 Pro sound awesome with Google AI onboard! Looking forward to getting more done, faster with these. 😊📱
gosh, now I really want this phone
You had me at 7 years
When will Google make another foldable phone i rather use a fold phone with a 6.6 or 6.8 inch screen when will Google make a new foldable phone
Network issues on my pixel 6 in BD
"Pretend things are better than they are or were! Everything is fake and we love that!"
I have a P7P. See you on Pixel 12 release!!!
it is the dream phone for me which will not come true 😢 I'm just broken 💔  I can't afford this bcuz I'm poor 😢💔I'm working so hard to buy but I can't
Btw not bringing Pixel 8 to Malaysia market is a mistake. I don't see how google can expand its market with only a handful of countries having this
At 0.10 seconds, I can see very bouncy part, it doesn't look so stable after all
Consulta, llegará Wallpapers Cinematic a los Pixel 6
That 7 year commitment makes me want to get one
Thank you google for the flat screens! Omg finally, someone got rid of useless curved screen! Please all reviewers spread the word, let all tech companies remove useless curved displays!
the phone that beat iPhone soon..
RIP ✝️ Chinese Phones
Please improve thermals and battery and this will the best phone
7a,7 and 8 all looking same
All the people in the world thought Google wasn't serious so the video wasn't on the trending list but now after seeing the phone its on the trending list... Stupid Global Community....
Need to resort parallel imports since I'm from HK
#short @islamicbasicidea
That image editing looks amazing!
Hey Google! We need stereo speakers!
When is your phonecall screening system coming to india 😭
so when will you make the Pixels' bazels equal?
This is a software update not a new phone lol
Tosin abasi
Google was not pregnant but they delivered this time around❤❤❤
0:07 Is that AOC?
I think it's high time to bid farewell to my pixel 4.... and add another 4 to it
Seems like g3 is not that great. No highlight at all.
meet jerryscratcheverything new video
Google deletes all negative comments about Pixel phones
We need the edge display
if i buy two pixel 4 and mixed it up can it work like pixel 8 ? 😅
"That's kind of our thing"  The best line I've ever heard from a smartphone company 💗🤌🏻
Owning a pixel phone is complete dream!
Unfortunately, this phone is weak, and I like Samsung more because of Samsung Dex, let me know if google would invent something similar  😂
Sell it in Vietnam Please, I am bored to death with apple and samsung
Wooo... this is definitely an iphone killer! ... ... ... ... I support it by getting a new Iphone 15.
Looks like a lot of great features, but curious to know if they fix the issue with the phones dropping data connection.
I want to buy. But how to from bd.
🤩🤩🤩🤩
Loving my Pixel 7, would love to keep in the Google family.
Please some take my pixel 7 pro and as a gift give me pixel 8 pro 😢
ฉันรอเธออยู่
It has fixed thermal issues, improved battery life/a bit faster charging, and an ultrasonic under-display fingerprint sensor. Does anyone know?
Brazil has 215 million people, and for some reason google chooses to ignore it and refuses to launch the pixel there. Good job
I bought a pixel 7 pro and I regret buying it. I feel i was scammed
Reality blurred
No point of launching a new pixel if google don’t  bother expanding and selling this product to more countries . From pixel 6 till 8 , google only officially selling this pixel in singapore but not to  other south east asia countries 🙄
❤
If they fixed the overheating issues then its a solid buy from me
@madebygoogle can gift me a pixel phone 📱 because I'm using pixel 1&3 from 4 years 😢
When will Pixel come in Malaysia ? Official pls
Storkandroid UI...🤮🤮🤮
Does this phone do anything besides take photos?
I think the quality of google products is perfect, but what I am concerned about is the design. Google should update the shape of the Phone.
Improve the battery for God sake!
will older phones like 6 & 7 series receive pro mode update on the camera?
Bought the pixel 5 after finally getting rid of iOS and I must say I am not going back to iOS anytime soon and I will buy the pixel 8 :)) gg’s to Google !!!
Google is becoming my favourite phone brand
I hope this phone realeas in Indonesian😢
Matsiro be 😋 🤤
I might consider this an upgrade for my OnePlus 8 Pro. Its just the brand name switch
But can make a phone call with it?
wow😍pro looks so beautiful👌 so we get pixel buds pro with pixel 8 and watch 2 with pixel 8 pro ryt?
Indonesia need it!!!
I think this is the best phone for me . Real beauty .
The price is too high in India why is that soo😢😢😢😢😢
It’s always nice
Do we know if the Desktop mode will be available? Like what Dex does on Samsung?
OMG THIS IS DASTISH FANTASTISH BROOO I'M GONNA DIE WITH IT ❤❤❤❤❤🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
Built-it VPN...by google? Yeah, no thanks. Google should GIVE me the phone for free for collecting all that sweet sweet data.
10/10 google 👏
At first you have to proof that Google will be a reliable company in the future. With Apple I can trust that apps and services will be available in 5 years as well. With Google I'm only sure that 90% of the new services will be killed within 2-3 years. You got a trust problem and should work on it.
Adress batao bhai please
Adress batao bhai please
Change camera bumb it's looking good
And yet the coments are blocked on that long keynote sad
Imma get the green one ! And goodbye iPhone
lol kinda our thing :-D not, exactly!
0:31 🔥🔥🔥
Prebooked Pixel 8 pro right after the keynote 🎉 Software and cameras with AI would be the trademark for Pixel phones. Loved it. And 7 years of support - its simply wow ❤  However these is one thing i really did not liked, differentitation google is showing for US and Indian Consumers.   Example - For US consumers - Pixel watch 2 will be shipped along with prebook order for Pixel 8 pro at free of cost which is great   But for Indian market, pixel 2 watch will be available with a discounted price when we pre book pixel 8 pro  which is not great.   If Google treats all customers in a similar manner, then these are the differences they should be acted upon which will improve the trust for Indian consumers on Brand Google.
1:05 Do you have to pay for the VPN?
I'm always a pixel fan boy. But unfortunately theses newly pixels are isn't in my destiny because I can't afford.😢
❤❤❤
Please sell it in Indonesia 😢
Price is too high for india
That Tensor G3, lol they should switch to Snapdragon chipsets
I from Iran  I love google  thank you google❤❤❤
May be you have forgotten to mention poor network and heating. Lol
Bye iphone 15 plus. U have no 120 hertz 🤣
its 2023 now yet Android vanilla ui still BORING n Ugly. Cmos  google your a billion dollar company it wouldnt hurt you if you hire more creative people to bring life to Android
What is a photo 😂
76 k for this garbage 🗑️
if they say 7 years of update don't  compare it with updates like other manufactures give believe me i had a pixel 3a xl it can still beat most of new phones when it comes to software goggle is just king
Inbuilt VPN wow🤙
Actual innovation unlike apple
Above ₹1,00,000 in India 😱
Please send me one for free🎉😊
Kapan rilis di Indonesia
My pixel 7 is still going strong so I'll probably eait until support on this device is over to upgrade. But good job Google
Smartest Smart Phone: SSP
I can't afford it man😢😢😢
Worst service centre in Bangalore don't buy any one Google pixel mobile India,,😡
Does it have a headphone jack?
Sell it worldwide. 🙄
Pixels are best 😍❣️
Better than iPhony
Yes.. Something new is added....
Really exciting ❤❤❤
Ai this AI that blah blah, just hand me the phoen already
Why so much niggas on the vid? Google suck!
How much?
Improve the overheating and battery charging speed and i will buy the pro version
The iPhone Killer 👑🐐
Google broke all the rules this year. Preparing for the future. The beginning of a new era with Generative AI and the first AI processor ready for this! A step to the next level in the company seems more than impressive to me, it is truly impressive that this year Google fell in love with us all.
Does pixel 8 support call history of a given contact? The fact that this is not available in pixel 7 suggests to me that the creator of these phones are actually not using the phone. 😮
I love pixel phone, they are amazing. The new colors no, they are ugly af.
I think it's time to me to take a  pixel
Cant wait for Googles Magic on our hand the future is NOW
Just ordered the Pixel 8 pro. Upgrading from my Pixel 7 that I was able to upgrade from my Pixel 6 for $20. 8 pro was a pricer upgrade but also got the pixel watch 2 LTE for $50 to pair with my Google Fi service. Wish I got the LTE version of the original Pixel watch but now my son gets a new watch with my old watch. The Blue is awesome. Got my wife the 7a in blue it looks great. Glad I got what I really wanted this time.
Dear Apple, Google is here😅
Kindly make all the features available for all the regions  not just for specific regions
is pixel 8 pro good for gaming? Is the Tensor G3 chip as powerful as Qualcomm Snapdragon Gen 2?
Love google ❤️
New Google phone is very beautiful I am definitely sitting for your creativity thinking
this looks dope
waiting pixel pakistan
Can we still make calls on this phone.. As you guys didn't mentioned anything about this new feature of calling people.
The last line was sick, "its AI and that's kind of our thing" 🔥🔥
now a days every one focused on camera
I wonder if they've allowed DP-OUT / DP Alt Mode yet. Never going back until they do. Absolutely scummy bullshit to lock it in the firmware. I didn't want to switch to Samsung, but was left with no choice.
Same than pixel 7😂😂
Google, the only thing missing is something like FaceTime.   The ease of use my kids and parents could do it.   That’s what you need next year.
So... We got black and gray?
Wish google release their phones in my country
Iphone right now:  RIGHT THAT DOWN!!RIGHT THAT DOWN!!RIGHT THAT DOWN!!
Sorry but BAD DESIGN
Póngalo a la venta en México 🇲🇽
What use is this great phone when you don't even release it to other markets? T_T
Why is the porcelain colour not available in India?
💟
Google Pixel 8 pro is going to be the best android phone ever beating Samsung and other premium Chinese brands hands down. Google has greatly invested in technology, innovation and new gen AI among improving the cameras and hardware. With Pro level photo and video editing tools Google pixel 8 pro has already made its mark. Only drawbacks I see is the lesser battery capacity 🪫 and lesser charging capability. This should improve. Also, I did not hear anything on the astro photography capabilities on pixel 8 pro.
This is what innovation looks like. The amount of new features is amazing. Not some titanium BS.
Too much AI I guess. But love pixel ❤
I like the pixel 8 pro I'm waiting for the pixel 9 pro I still like my pixel 6 pro
The AI photo editing’s gone too far. What if someone was unhappy in a moment, and without their knowledge you change the phot and share it? There’s touching up a photo and then there’s lying, and this stepping over that line
*If keeping for 7 years, can we replace the battery easily?*
I may not be in a region that sells Pixels, but I'm still just as excited as the next person.  (strictly speaking, South-East Asia does sell Pixels in Singapore, but even I can't bother going through Imigration despite Singapore just being about a 3 hour drive away from home)
Is it coming to India?
benchmarks are interesting
Don't know since how long I had been waiting to launch pixel ✨
I'll wait til the 9. If my 7 doesn't break by then
Hi Google Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro
1 lakh and heating
The phone will be okay if the battery is okay
When will you arrive in Mexico?
Tbh one thing I appreciate is Google daring to use white people in their promo shots. Apple seems to consistently erase us. It's the little things. Love to be represented.
Wow
Love the features, just hope that it is way less fragile than the 6 pro and doesn't have problems dialing 911.
Did they fix the overheating while shooting 4K video and finger print unlock?
If this can play smooth genshin, i will switch from my iphone
tensor 🤮
We need call recording Google, its gonna help us in lot of time.try fix it with update guys..as a fan boy I'm amazed 🎉😮❤
90% of this commercial is about cloud-based software enhancements. Most of it will be on Google One in 6 months. Begs the question, why is this device priced higher for nothing new? #justsayin
When will you be available in the Philippines?
I want to buy , but google pixel is not available here in my country Indonesia😢. Google, if you expand your business, you probably would beat Samsung.  Cuz your camera is better than Samsung
Is this a camera advertisement? What about phone features?
I'm gonna wait for the Pixel 9 pro. Currently have a pixel 7 pro now. I love it.... I've upgraded to the odd number phones lol  Pixel (blue) Pixel 3 (black) Pixel 5 (black) Pixel 7 Pro (black)
I cant wait to get my Bay 8 Pro!! Such a pretty blue.
OK Google .. Show me nearby Pixel Store!
I’m have Google Pixel 6a
and google still under estimate indonesian market
Where is reality now   Just use filters 🙈🙈🙈
Deep fake pics by google
🥱😴😴😴😴😴🥱
Precioso ❤
Ok Google, hear me out. The imperfections in a photo makes it perfect. Cause it's the real deal. Most of the times at least
UFS 3.1
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Oh how wonderfully awesome these phones are! I just wish they are available globally!🥹
just add fast charging and change your chipset with Snapdragon by TSMC
So underwhelming
Fast charging
In terms of UI & OS Android far far ahead of time just needs to focus on good hardware & battery technology
Still using my pixel 4a haha😅
I'm on the - every 3 year - upgrade cycle now.  The old me was every year. Not anymore. Sure they're nice and it's not even the money, I feel stupid upgrading every year now.
All I want is Google Photos unlimited storage.🥲
Pixel 4A is goatted
Think about it. Google is basically updating the new 8 series for the same length of time the whole Pixel line has existed. 2016, 7 years ago. Imagine the first Pixel receiving updates all the way till the 7. This is a reality with the 8 and its just amazing.
7 years of software update is the best move by Google 👍👍👍👍
Definitely gonna save up money for this
Total flop with the price.
Yooo
0:09 you cannot tell me that you use that crack quality as an ad
Heating issues??
I love the punch hole phones  Apples giant pill shaped camera cut out is annoying
Is it magic?. No. It’s AI 🤣
Smoke cigarettes
To get the most out of the Pixel watch, a user must pay for a premium subscription to Fitbit.  The paywall issue is a deal breaker. I will need to wait for Samsung in February to make a decision.   What Open software applications are usable with the watch or can be downloaded onto the Pixel 8 Pro without an SD slot? Are there ways to bypass the advertising and data collection Google acquires from the watch? I guarantee Google can read your thoughts and behaviour patterns (at a 99.99% accuracy and validity factor) with the watch after a few weeks of wearing it and using the apps.
Perfect 👌
Saya akan membelinya dalam waktu dekat
Software 😲
let see how G3 tensor performs but I want snapdragon. 🙃
7 years of OS support just nuts. Big kudos to Google!
If only it has snapdragon and good battery life
My 7 pro overheats regularly when i'm taking long videos. Hope they fix that processor
the battery is not lasting for 7 years
Good job Google! The last thing to reach perfert is back to Snapdragon chips!  Samsung's chips are really bad. You can make your own chips. But just leave samsung along. It's very important! The only weakness and the most mayjor weakness.
Still people will buy Iphone 15, don't know why ?! Google has a lot to offer at a price less than the 15 pro and pro max
same case for 3 years  lame
جهاز ممتاز pixel 8❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
make the pixel fold bigger please😢
I'm still using the Pixel 5 and it's still a great phone. This, however, is the first time since the Pixel 5 that there are symmetrical bezels and the phone looks great again. Plus the 7 years of software updates would be great since I still love my Pixel 5!
Yess, finally Google will drop the pixel 8 so the pixel 7 will be cheaper and finally I'll buy the pixel 6 🎉🤠
Google is coming swinging hard. No mercy.
My dream phone
We need Ai not Raw like i… 😂
Make a mini version and its jackpot.
The design is a little ugly but I wouldn't mind if I got one for free #GoogleSponsorMe
Pixel 7 and 7a was the best smartphone for users who don't play 3D games.  It's sad that the price of Pixel 8 has increased significantly outside of the US.
if you guys release this good phone in more region that would be great
I literally just bought the 7 pro man 💀
Small phones (5") please !! I'm looking forward to upgrade from my Pixel 1
I’m impressed.
Genuinely decided to switch from my S23 Ultra to the pixel 8 pro because of the honest to goodness innovation that google is pushing. Cant wait for the 12th!!
the reality is going to be f******!
Making it extremely difficult to choose. I like the satin finish and form factor of 8 but the features of Pro.
Same to my iphone 7 years update hope you colab
At 00:10 That's how the videos on google pixel 8 looks like without video boost? Too exag I would say
Control heating issue this time.
Honestly, this really excites me more than the Apple keynote event. This is what real improvement looks like. Will definitely order one.
Pixel isnt available in my region. Will all the features still work?
Fast charging ?? Otherwise no thanks
thermometer really gonna help me check for fevers 😂
Makes me wanna leave Samsung.
Got the upgrade to Android 14 today 👍
Could you please launch it in México??
G3 так же тротлить будет как и G2?
Shame I can’t order it in Poland
Google literally showed that it is the King of smartphones. iphone 15 is a joke in front of all the capabilities this phone has.
This morning I got the email saying it the Pixel 8 Pro was ready to pre-order. Before I checked the official presentation I ordered it (I gotta say I'm a bit of a Google and Pixel fanboy), and oh boy... after watching the whole video I was even more hyped about getting it! LET'S GOOOOOOOO!!! :D
I just preordered the Pixel 8. It will be my 3rd Pixel, can't wait!
it looks exactly the same as the previous pixel.
Pre-ordered before they even finished the live stream.  Really looking forward to it.
The last phone I bought brand-new was the pixel 3. Since they've removed active edge and the rear fingerprint sensor, I haven't bought a phone new since. I just bought a brand new pixel 5 - at least it has a rear fingerprint sensor.
Congratulations on the launches, please bring your products to Brazil !! 🙏🏻
Watching it on My Pixel 7 Pro Google just does it best
Finally night sight in video recording😍🤩
I hope this one does not get warm when using video
Battery and performance. Mine is slow and runs out quite fast
Hesitant to jump back into a pixel device after my horrid bug ridden experience with the 6 pro
Wish I could buy one from Mexico :(
Wow I have never purchased a Pro/Premium model of a phone before but have a Pixel 6a. Google gave a fantastic trade in deal and free Watch 2! Easy decision. Thanks Google. Pairing these with my Buds Pro (wish I had the blue pair now lolol).
*Cries in Greece* guys please bring ‘em to us. Ughhh
I love Pixel.. Was this all shot with a Pixel?
This year I'm coming back to Pixel for sure! Went back to iPhone last year and regretted it.
iPhone 15 😂😂😂😂😂 is dead good ☠️☠️☠️☠️this is alien tech from 2030
The major update was with the Pixel 6. This, isn't really an update, so you better call it Pixel 6 III. Thanks.
It’s finally time for me to switch to Google Pixel. Here I come 👍🏾😁
I have a genius idea for the Pixel lineup: actually sell them. Like why is it only available in only 17 countries. You're not gonna be able to compete with Apple any time soon.
نطالب بجهاز بكسل في السعودية بشكل رسمي
Nobody cares about your device because of battery timing. Pixel is way behind if there is no battery time improvement!
7 Years Update ♥️♥️♥️♥️
Bought 7 because of the VPN, 1 month later it got disabled...
Everybody laughed "Check-In" when Apple presented it...
Great prices in Europe, thanks Google
Could’ve made the pro green too, it’s my favorite color of the line. I preordered the porcelain because I didn’t like the blue (blue is my favorite color and I still didn’t like it here 🤷🏽‍♂️)
Ordering the pixel 8 pro + the watch for me and my dad!
7 Years of OS update....crazzy!!!!!!❤
I was blown away by this A.I. feature... so much way ahead of Iphone...
Release the manual camera mode to the regular Pixel 8. It should not be a pro feature, every other phone manufacturer has a similar mode for all their models. I've been waiting for this mode since I bought the Pixel 2 and I prefer smaller phones. There is no reason to not add the manual mode on the Pixel 8, there are no limitations other than you wanting to make the Pro model look better. This decision is not consumer friendly in any way.
Sell in Thailand Officially please......
Pre ordered today🎉
so judgging by this video the phone is just 25 photo modes and AI. Ai AI AI. Did we say it's AI? So AI.
Tensor most likely way worse rhan Snapdragon and Bionic. Slow charging, Display not on par with the top tier.  Would be amazing phones for 600 and 900€ but this is disappointing.
Porfavor traerlo a LATAM, en Colombia lo esperamos.
My year old 6a is working smooth with Google's s/w and AI magic.... seems more wonders are there in 8 series...😊
Why Pixel Buds pro is not free on pre-order of Pixel 8 and Pixel watch on Pixel 8 pro for Indian market when it was announced during keynote.   Kindly look #TeamPixel
I'm torn between the Pixel 8 and the Nothing Phone (2) - I'll see what the battery/processing power of the Tensor G3 is like and how it compares to the Phone (2)'s Snapdragon 8 Gen 1
Pixel 6 = pixel 8, but it is Apple the bad guy)
Google can I have a pixel 8 pro for free please 🥺
Over priced in india 😮
where are the other colors? Hmmm
7 years of software support ? I'm there ! Support for ky S10 ended but it works just fine. I don't wanna leave the android world and this is exactly what i was waiting for. Longer support ! Hurray !
Please upgrade the pixel 7 pro camera app google
Are the thermals improved @Google ?
With some features like call screen being unavailable across regions, particularly in India, it's not going to be worth an upgrade. The best thing about the keynote about the pixel devices for me was the really long support that is being offered on these devices.
It seems like I'll have to buy a Pixel now.  Such a incredible device
Nice! Does 7 years OS update imply Android 21 in 2030? Also, this doesn't include Pixel 6 and 7 though they have a Tensor chip?   If it's 8 exclusive, then it's about time I switch from my 3XL sometime next year or if a good deal becomes available during the holidays.
S23 ultra vs google pixel 8 pro need
That blue is stunning. Sometimes a splash of color can make a big difference. Keep it up with this fantastic Pixel design language. Also, 7 years of support is a rare and very compelling promise! PS: Pixel 7 is the best phone I've ever had in every way. As a fan, it's good to see this series is successful and continues.
G 🫶🏻
This is 😮
How can a smartphone get this smart. Incredible.
The price is very high.. I would rather buy an iPhone at the same price
For $999 it should have been 512 GB 16 GB of memory Y'all just constantly drop the ball why can't you be on top You're Google My gosh you're supposed to be the best You're supposed to be the company and you let Apple and Samsung kick your butt
Love the compact size of 6.2 inch for pixel 8. Its gonna be so good to feel it in hand
I was excited about getting one until I heard that you raised the price by a hundred bucks your processors are still way behind everybody to me that's a big deal it's not worth paying $100 more I'm disappointed
I wish it was available in UAE. Wanting to try my hands at one since years
This phone should outperform its competitors anyday ... I just don't like the looks of it since Pixel 6 :") Doesn't give that wow feel in the first look as iPhone 12-15, looks like a tv remote. :)   Else Pixel is amazing, a true SMART Phone
The custom roms gonna go crazy!
Storage missing
The Phone is nice everything is nice but battery and also the charging speed it should be atleast 45 watt price has increased from last years so features should also get increased the phone is too pricey
really looking foward to this phone (maybe we can see it in Portugal, oficially)
Go woke Go broke
Please get these to Finland also
Can I not preorder this in India?
i'am goggle phone user best phone goggle.
Please, Gift me pixel 8 & take my 6a 😅..
Ahhhhhh best phone everrr, my brother and i love it, we just pre-ordered it 😸
Just pre-ordered, switching from a pixel 4 to this new pixel 8 I hope this phone is amazing google!
Preordered mine cant wait to get my hands on this master peice you truly out done urselfs google😊
Looks more like camera launch instead of phone.
The only thing i disliked about my 6 pro was the curved screen, looks like the 8 pro is the way
Is camera everything new in a phone seriously?
Amazing
Massive price jump and old GN1 sensor for the camera.  I'm not impressed.  The GN1 was used in the pixel 6 pro...
Hay google, use the camera bar,s metal to reduce heat while using camera or gaming. & Develop a good floating window system.
Definitely upgrading to this when my pixel 6 contract finishes at Christmas
The design is just the definition of “beauty”🤩
Finally, symmetrical bezels are back! I've been waiting for them since Pixel 5.
We want to see Google Pixel in Türkiye 🇹🇷 !!!
Does Pixel Phones finally have video out over usb c to use desktop mode?
Google, please bring Pixel to Latin America!!❤❤
Google + AI = Evil
Would be nice if you could actually preorder Google Pixel phones in Croatia...
Don't trust Google pixel , my pixel 4a phone charger not work sometime ,
Battery life and thermal issues are the real deal breaker for me .... Otherwise always loved the pixel lineups
Looks like Google finally fixed the pre-ordering mess from other years with the servers going down from the heavy load. I didn't have any issues when I went to pre-order and when I checked throughout the day.  Congratulations! 🎉
I placed my order and my pixel eight Pro and I gotta watch for free great deal one terabyte of storage. I love you. Google.
Google bhi india ke liye ek Hindi advertisment kiye hote😊
If it does not heat then the best phone of the century 😁
No doubt it’ll have amazing software too for processing images unlike some pro phones.   (PS. This ad looked so good on my iPhone 14 Pro Max 🙈🥹.)
No bog difference google did this year ....only the chip and brightness was developed and battery little bit...im little bit disappointed...i was exited... specially for new design to the phone and new camera sensor and more resolution in the display and more features  😢
I'll pass.
Wohooo! Excited for the Pixel 8 series
When Apple does 5% of these, the crowd goes absolutely crazy.
Hate FLAAAAAAT SCREEEEN
Most of the world won't take seriously company that puts he/him in front of obvious man
Except for the 7 years upgrade, nothings improved much
My suggestion for Google ...  1) please skip 128 GB  it wont make it sense...  2) introduce Alert slider like Apple and Iphone ( hardware for active slient mode )  3) Indian Market is price  sensitive...  You always overp price your phone by 20%...
Looks like I have to finally upgrade from my pixel 2xl (which btw still works perfectly). 7 years of software update <3
Google crushed it with this event. I cannot believe I actually bought the pro in a heartbeat even though this is my very first flagship device.
Why only focus on camera features and not other important stuff like battery life etc...
I'm still using my best ever mobile phone. it is galaxy m01😏
Have I seen this before?
I wish it has good connectivity 🙏
Trust me pixel phones will surpass certain companies.
Great. Looking after this phone.
Es hermoso, quiero el azul 🎉❤
128gb for colors.. cmon man
Look at the pixel 8 compact phone ever seen ❤
Bsdk thoda sasta hi kar deta 76k ka hai. . .
Everyone here is talking about the 7 years of support even though no one is gonna use it that long 😀
❤❤❤ #Pixelteam
Por favor google tráelo a México 🇲🇽 ❤😊
Nothing was said about battery? Ok now I'm afraid lol... Only pixel users can relate
Pre-booked a 7 right after the keynote, last year. It was a great decision! Still rocking it. Never had one dull day with my Pixel. Looking at the 8 right now I'm sure that this is going to be even better.
Did they rectify the washed out display issue from 7 series ?
Why does it feel like I’m watching an Apple ad
I just hope it gets better at voice texting.  I have a 6 plus and this thing can't put a period in the correct spot to save its life...
Apple competitor is here
Please bring the pixel to Mexico
I bought a pixel 7 and watch .. worst decission ever .. no thanks ,. even One Plus is better ..
Battery battery battery you guys forget about this department alwaysss please look into it ❤
Got the pixel 6 a week and I'm already thinking of changing to to 8. Best phone ever
The features seems very nice, i would love to upgrade to pixel 8 after reading actual reviews
can i trade in a pixel 7 for a 8 pro?
It's nice to see all those professional camera and AI features, but first, Google should focus on improving the battery life, network issues, heating issues and incorrect fingerprint reading of Pixel phones. Bcoz those are the practical things which actually matter in the real world usage.
Best phone with AI
Please zoom x100 to beat samsung !
Built in VPN sounds amazing 🔥
Google ione Box 8 Pro. 7 yers software update😂 . Maximum phone Life 3 Yers... 😂
100 $ more this year and 125 $ less trade in on pixel 7 then last year.. so pixel this year is 225 $ more expensive then last year pre order.. Google can stick new Pixel up it ...!
"Nope, its AI and that is kinda our thing"  Oh Google, so cringe
Not worth the upgrade from 7 series
Oof build in VPN by Google. Data collecting go brrrr.
0:10
Why such a massive price jump? Improvements from last year are always expected for same price, but how you justify this massive price difference I have no idea  Imagine you improve pixel from last year as you did/would normally, expected performance improvements and new features are normal , so better phone , same price. Old models get cheaper  What now google did, selling the old models for same price and put the price of new pixel at such high price , they basically did the same what Apple did. So theoretically it’s a same phone for 25% more money taking into consideration that improvements are normal and expected so they just raised the price without anything extra for the consumer  because anyone could just spent extra money and buy better iPhone, now they charge same as iPhone but it’s half the performance /quality  Shame, I was excited about google pixel as I thought they will sell good phones for real prices, now they might as well join the greedy herd of Samsung and Apple  How much money do you really need  Shame on you google, we thought u were different
Made by google always the best! ❤
I already pre ordered the 8 pro, coming from 6 pro! Thanks for the free Pixel 2 watch!!!
7 years of update 🤩 good job! Google Though there is still lot to improve, and we hope you will definitely gonna 🔥
Add should have included "No big  notch😅 " - Sarcasm
0:10 Jiggly Jiggly
Still with UFS 3.1?😢
The best come 👍
I want 90 fps in bgmi
Only 128 GB available for sale in INDIA. WHY ???
I'll wait for the second generation in house chip.
Jak zamówić pixela w preorderze do Polski?
They certainly make a very compelling case... I can't wait for 2027, when that 7 year update pledge will be matched with an easily replaceable battery.
pls just make a smaller version
what a price... Is it made of gold?
Just fabulous
🗑️🗑️💩💩
You had me at 7 years of software support. ❤
This really looks like a promising device in line of iPhone
Google, the pricing in India was heartbreaking. As much as many of us wanted to by it, realised it's beyond budget :(
Ahhhh, I made it into the commercial!! 😭🫶🏽✨✨
Wooooooooooooooooooow dude🤯
Beautiful design Google pixel i love this Mobil
Nobody is talking about the Autofocus on Selfie camera, that will improve tons the videos and photos as well, has been an issue in the last Pixels phones, definitely a win there
Desde hace mucho me quiero comprar un pixel pero han tirado tantos proyectos y han echo gastar a uno con tantas decepciones que he dudado. Yo era fan de Google pero bueno
Pixel 8 in Bay with matt back would be a dream. Like this its to much Money for Something I look at daily and aint totally satisfied with
Love it..The photo stuff is insane
Can't preorder in Czech republic.... Shame.
Google you have again over priced the phone for india. Half your AI won't work in india and the pro is way too expensive for the Indian market and that too when the sales are going to start in a few days.  Missed opportunity again.
If my Pixel 6a is so good already, i can only imagine how good this phone is
Night Sight Video and whopping 7 years of os updates was genuinely surprising
I love pixel phones performance but i can't purchase in pakistan It's a very bad thing for me Plz start pixel phone sales in pakistan also Thanks
My volume button from Pixel 7 Pro just fell off, did you program it to fell right on Pixel 8 release?  Smart Move!
make it available in more countries...
If google can fix heating and network problems . Then it's the beast 🔥.
Please make some small and compact pro configuration mobile
Bro this is amazing
Its AI, and that's kind of our thing. <#
Lot of bakchodi and provide battery less ph. 🖕
come to brazil 😭
It's coming winter closely and this heater by pixel too 🔥😂
Everything is by far excellent and exceeded all our expectations this time. Its just a bombshell of software magic.  But pricing here in INDIA😮
Watching from pixel 6.. just love it
Apple guy's don't cry😂
Many of the features doesn't support outside US. That's sad.
1000 usd ☠️☠️☠️😄😂😂
Very bad pricing in India
But Tensor processor is not good
💟
2 colors???
Hope battery and thermals are improved significantly..then im definately getting this one..pls google launch this in india at good price it will be a Rocker 🔥🔥🔥
Garbage
Feeling jealous by 7 years. ~pixel 7 user
WAAAAA,,,,I want on but just bought the Pro 7...... I won't be able to afford it...... 😞
why use UFS 3.1 instead of UFS 4.0?
Is it heater like 7, or any changes to processor Funny thing is Samsung is not using there processor for there own flagship phone, but Google buying the heater(processor) for pixels, why can't change to mediatek or snapdragon, complete waste of junk with Samsung processors
Pre-ordered already! :D
Already ordered with the free Watch 2!  :)
Android 14 release when?
8 and 8 pro price too high in India.  Not worth for that money
A real smartphone unlike the  🍎
Trash I hat apple ans this is just like apple. Gonna switch my pixel with a Nubia.
where to prebook in India?
Ordered the pixel 8 pro with the free pixel smartwatch
I don't like that the 8 pro is big. I do wish the base model wasn't so compromised. for that fact imma need to feel it in hand first. I love everything else though
What about battery and any heating issue?
Pixels love ❤
love you guys
Just seen the cost in the UK for the Pixel 8 going up £100 (£699) on last year's price? This is just a blatant attempt to rip off the British consumer. The US price is 699 (£570) how can you justify this price difference?   I didn't buy the pixel tablet in the UK because you did the same and I won't be buying the Pixel 8 for the same reason. What makes the US different?   Shame on you Google for ripping off the British consumer under the guise of material and interest price rises, if this was the case this would be reflected  in the US price and it would be the same.
Im actually buying one, i was expecting such a kind of improvements in pixel 9 series,  but it's already here, Great Job❤️⚡
Finally flat screen 😍
im loving my pixel 7 but come on bro, 7 years? i just got the pixel 7
Meanwhile Apple: "We have removed the USB - C cable and port... Revolutionary! Environment!"
76,000 INR for the Pixel 8!? Disappointing price tag in India.
Hay google please give me a free pixel 8 pro 😢
You beaut ❤
Pro is cheaper in US and they get pixel watch for free.....cmon google...pre order deal is lame in India.
Just ordered the pixel 8 pro! I've had the pixel 1 and currently have the pixel 4. These phones last for so long! Love em!
Well, as long as its Exynos (for those who don't know, Tensor is designed on exynos), sorry, nope. These features are incredible but as long as the battery life is trash, the phone is also automatically trash. Had the Pixel 6 Pro with 3,5-4h display on time. Yeah.
Why you delete my comment?  Do not buy Google Pixel Phones before reading issue tracker! 5G, Wifi and LTE calls are not available on Pixel phones out of US and some other contries from short list. You can't travel with them. You can't move over borders for work. It is not reliable PHONE.
I know the voiceover is now AI powered. Haha.. is the video powered by video boost(Would have preferred to be called Pixel Pro video or Pixel director mode)
7 yrs of updates.I just love it google  People like me really needed this. Hatsoff to you guys
No 256gb pixel8 pro launch in India It's very upsetting In the era of 1TB memory  And after spending more than one lakh rupees Indian's only get 128gb storage for pixel8 pro
Whats the charging speed?
hey guys, newbie here. You guys think the camera stands up to the flagships of Samsung and Apple. I love the magic editing tools, that already has me mostly onboard.
Terrible ad but phones should be good!
looking awesome can't wait it in Serbia :)
Lol I watched this before from the leaks
google done great job ❤🔥🔥 definately going for pixel 8 pro😮
Looks like im getting a new pixel
the battery life is the most disappointing in Pixel. if it improves I'm sure pixel will beat the iphone
Mark My Words. Google Is Going To Crush Any Other Smartphone In The Market. #GGTEAMPIXEL.
Grey Pixel 8 is GORGEOUS!!!!!!!!!!
😘🪄
Shouldn't have increased the price
Best pixel ever❤
lol fingerprint sensor doesnt work after 6 months , please fix hardware design ....
It will for sure lose to S23 ultra and Iphone 15 pro/pro max
This is amazing.
Messed up the Indian pricing Google.🥲
We need Pixel 8 in Mexico please 🇲🇽
Living abroad in a country where Pixels aren't officially sold, owning a P7P with a lot of software capped features (5G, call screening, crash detection, just to name a few) and having had 3 previous models before that, don't feel too compelled to upgrade. Why cap 56, for instance?! It's really inexplicable. It seems that Google is making a point that they want us NOT to buy Pixels abroad of the very few countries they sell them.
Are you selling a camera or a phone..😂
Desde 2018 ganhiu minha atenção
Just wondering if they could bring back Snapdragon silicon back, tensor G have heating issues (may be due to samsung fabrication)
Finally! Thank you Google for starting to sell pixels officially in Belgium. Preordering one now.
I was expecting 60k for pixel 8 💔 Will keep my pixel 6A for few months more
iPhone!! U r dead 😂
Google ❤
the smartest phone, and 7 years of security updates look really promising. Good Job Google.
Battery 🔋 life and thermals people. Stop using rebranded freaking Samsung exynos chips. Oh well, maybe next year.
Your next phone maybe not iPhone:smile:
Why UFS 3.1 though? Is it really that hard to provide the latest?
I hope they add some of these Features to pixel 7 pro😊
I want my photos REAL, not perfect. That face and background swapping feature is just crossing the line for me.
You made my day 😁😍🙂😊😘😃
Much better than showing Titanium
Iam used pixel 4a ,and very happy
When will thia all come in pixel 7a?
Totally a flagship 🎉 price 😢
Just forgot about service centres?😅
After having a horrible battery life with the Pixel 6 Pro and Pixel 6 and a broken back glass of Pixel watch, time to say goodbye for now. I really liked the AI features but build quality and battery performance needs to be improved so much. AI and software is great, but what if your phone only complete half a day? My phone is most of the time in Battery Saver mode while im at work and that disables many features. I had good hopes with Google but AI and all the software gimmicks not enogh reason for a standard user to stay with Pixel products.
please give me one.
No mention of battery life improvements or thermals, doesn't sound good tbh.
"Helps keep your info secure" lmao Good one Google.
Love that ❤
I think I have seen this video before 👀
It's sad that they are keeping the good stuff for the pro phones, just like apple. SAD
But, is it privacy-minded?
why dont u sell in indonesia?
I'm so mad that there is no regular 8 blue just the huge model has cute blue color...
Jak będzie sklep w Polsce to kupie Pixela 🤔
If they solve heating, network issue, and fast charging, that would be greatest phone ever released
the 2400 nits and 48mp for all the cameras is what entrees me. also the 7 years of phone support
Should launch with snapdragon processor... will definitely buy...
Pixel phones are not reliable.. even rupees ten thousand phone is more reliable specially in India .. worst phone 😊
They are expensive as hell in India, its a lost opportunity for google to take a slice in the phone pie in India this way.
Imagine if google uses AI.
In USA, price increased by 11%,    but in India you increased it by almost 30%        despite of reduction in custom duty rate (and exchange rate just rised by 4-5%  )  This is not fair google   AND they are not even giving any preorder offer   like in USA.     What a shame for a brand that is not even in    Top 5   in market share.
Greetings from Russia
Please extend the software support for the pixel 7 as well. 3 years of OS updates is very bad for a Google flagship device.
7 years? I wondered if the phone would last that long, given that the repairability is made easier hopeing that the processor holds its power till the end.
Let's hope not overheating  like 6
If only the video boost was made available offline onboard, this would have been around maybe 2 years ahead of the competition?
When do you sell it in indonesia officially ?
Gift me 1 Google pl
Does it have desktop mode ??
Stop making it slippery AF. Square edges, not rounded.
Brand new Heater..lol
7 years of support sounds wonderful, but i would love to see it applied retroactively. I have a 7 Pro and obviously i would like the phone to live longer
Prices too high
India only gets the 128gb version for 8 pro. Makes no sense Google.
Let's just pretend this wasn't leaked
I want one so badly😊
For what it is this phone just got too expensive in Europe , from 899€ for 7 pro (which now can be found for under 800€), to 1099€ for 8 pro....8 pro doesn't even look better than 7 pro ....  Disappointed with this release.DOA
$1k is a bit pricey for me since I don't want the Pixel watch. For those that want the Pixel watch though, it's a good deal.
Most intelligent phone ever! The interesting thing is it is on par with other flagship phones of Samsung and Apple.  Google delivered it  this time.
0:39  what...😅😅👍👍
If only this is available in the Philippines. 😢
but the google Trade-in have no option to iphone 14 pro max version
i love pixel seires ❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹
I am so happy Google is keeping this beautiful design instead of copying Apple like Samsung did with the camera placement.   I got the 7 pro last year and sold my iPhone 14Pro Max. The Pixel is just way smarter and useful phone. A year later super happy with my decision to switch back to Android. Thank you Google for being different.  Now, please. In 2023 memory is cheap. You will be providing 7 years of security updates. Get rid of 128Gb and start using as a baseline 256gb.
So beautiful 😍
Already ordered mine let's gooo
And people say iPhones look the same every year
awesome 😮
Apple killer...
Happy to see Face adjustment feature is reintroduced after a decade! I first saw this feature in a Huawei Ascend P1 a decade ago.
Pixel has evolved from smartphone to AI phone ❤
Kenapa sih gaada di indonesia
this design will be forever is the most beloved and beautiful device especially in all colours and one of them is very fun energetic colours 😊💖 and 7 years of updates it's probably one of the best in the industry right now 🎉😍🤯
Last year pricing was very competitive for India this time 😢 crossing 1 lacks better to wait for some discounts and there is no free watch or buds for that price 😮
You got me, it feels really great.
I would buy it right now if they were sold in Mexico
Titanium has left the chat...
The Pixel 8 may have failed in Japan. Recently, more and more people in Japan are switching to cost-effective products as prices are rising but salaries are not. With the introduction of the Pixel 7, the percentage of iPhone users in Japan dropped from 58% to 46%, and for the first time in two years, the percentage of iPhone users is below 50%. However, if the price of Pixel is the same as iPhone, fewer people will switch from iPhone to Pixel. Benchmarks are iPhone>Galaxy>Pixel, but not many people will go out of their way to buy a lower-performing product.
AI is like gimmick
❤
Google will one day be THE dominant force in the mobile market.
Background sound -Cop siren to black guy playing instrument 👀👀
indian price 1.07L or 1285 usd. wow 28.5% taxes thanks govt of india.
What's keeping you from adding pro controls to older pixels?
Still no USBC to HDMI Output! So i will buy  again a Samsung Flagship. Samsung DEX is a revolution in mobile computing since the good old Samsung S8+ Days!
Just add snapdragon and i'm all yours
I wish the Pixels were available in the Philippines. 😔
Hey Google! When you gonna come up with pixel 8a ?
The iPhone 15 pro is already so old in comparation 😭💀
Really cool, but the thing she said at the end was just cringy.
Launch in Malaysia please.. it's such a pain trying to get one
That's how you make an amazing phone. Love the AI features, that's innovation, usefulness and fun-factor for me. Thank you Google!
1099€ well yea I need to wait for tests on thermal and battery life. If it's bad there is no point in buying it, I can get a s23 Ultra 512gb for 1079€ brand new...  The Europe price is just awful.
So according to Google AI means fake, fake smiles, fake faces, fake poses, fake scenes/ environments. Where is AI heading??😮
Are they selling phone or camera😂
My Google Pixel 6 Pro battery drains like hell!!!!
Built-in VPN @ Feature not available in countries with censorship
Sir j 8 pro gold colour available kijye
And the software updates discontinued in only 3 years.
It's not a photo anymore guys. RIP.
Respect for another portable oven 😂
Dang, I missed the live show. Dang 3rd period class
Look is so beautiful
Please fix the over HDR effect on the camera while taking even normal photos.. too weird to use the camera on the pixel 7
No one’s talking about how scary this camera is becoming and how fake photos are going to become in the near future?
Great step up from google this year, but I still think 128gb is not gonna age good for 7 years. A deal-breaker for me at least in India
Make it global I'm begging you 🙏🥺
We've seen big hardware improvements over the years. Now Google is Pioneering in Software Enhancement for phones 👏  8pro is probably the Best phone on the planet right now and it will be for years to come!
Watching this on my Pixel 6 Pro 🫠
106k in India for 8 pro. Ok prends. Tata bye bye.
Officially coming back to Pixel! Haven’t had one since the 2XL.
Apple : copies the same design!  People: apple is trash  Google: repeats the same design People: sensational 🫶 Fair enough....
Wow awesome ❤
if you talk about AI all the times without mentioning hardware upgrade, you are cheating.
Fix mobile network issue in Poxels
Google is always improving when releasing new phones, they always listen to costumers feedbacks🎉
Already Met Them.
Pyaar❤
Pixel fans are finally ready to humble the apple 🍎 fans
Not fun or interesting at all?? But pipol would come crashing when it's iPhone, whilst all the phone these days look the same with former generation
What about heating. My Pixel 7 heating up like crazy after taking photos and videos for less than 5 mins?
Please google make a flipphone  Pleeaaseeee
Google, you nailed it!! ❤❤
💛
I am in love with Pixel 8 Pro....But at the same time I can't leave my Pixel 7 Pro.... What to do😟
Google is integrating ai well with all features
Wow pixel 8 !!🥰🥰🥰
It's the time competitors know they are f**ked up on pixel launch. They can't match the amazing features and performance of the new Google phone. Pixel fans are ecstatic about the stunning camera, the fast charging, and the sleek design. No wonder everyone is talking about it. Pixel launch is the event of the year!
Just , ai ai ai but what about throttling and heating issue..
Oh yes!!
IPhone totally lost behind😂😂😂
Last year's pixel 7 pro vs pixel 8. Which one to buy now.  Looking for an update
only 128gb storage? that too UFS 3.1 why? when will the big boys come?
Just pre ordered my 8 Pro! Cant wait!
Overdose of AI
1139€ in Portugal? You must be kidding... haven't you done market research? It's more expensive than France or Spain that are more wealthy countries. I wanted to buy one but at that price and not even a free Watch, it's a no no.
the 7 years OS updates was a big deal tho
Hey, Google! When will the Tensor will produce by TSMC?
Pixel is my love ♥️
That commitment of 7 years is what's gonna make me buy this device. I love when manufactures try to establish so much trust.
Nothing phone 2 and Samsung s23 ultra will kill this easily.
I want one now 😍
Only thing pixel is lacking in it's battery and heat control, if this is improved it will be best phones🔥🔥
There is a white male in this add. I hope he is gay at least
Глянул презентацию, гребаная инклюзивность, негры, азиаты, жирухи.....
AI, AI, so much AI. Hard pass.
7 years of OS and security updates 🥳❤️❤️ and loved the new AI model to be rolled out in pro models would have liked on the base model. Just hope Google provide more support in India like other brands Samsung.
Батарея умрёт быстрее чем этот телефон перестанет получать обновления 😂
❤
7 year update will make me cumm to buy that phone
could you give me one free to advertize it on ethiopia
they dont have good trade in values anymore...
And YET, YALL HAVE NOT SEEM TO ADDRESS ISSUES THAT PEOPLE KEEP TELLING YOU, I LITERALLY JUST WATCHED THE KEYNOTE BE CAMERA TENNNNNNNNOORRRR CHIP SOFTWARE SOFTWARE SOFTWARE SOFTWARE AI NOT ONE MENTION OF WHAT PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY CONCERNED WITH, BATTERY LIFE AND CHARGE TIME AND HEAT DISSIPATION OH YEAA LOVE TAKEN ALL THESE PHOTOS AND VIDEO UNTIL IT'S OVERHEATING DOESN'T ALLOW YOU TO CONTINUE AND KILLS MOBILE DATA TIL IT COOLS DOWN YALL NEED TO SHOW THIS HAS BEEN TRULY ADDRESSED YOUR NOT GONNA HAVE PEOPLE TRULY CLAMORING OVER IT UNTIL THEN, NOT TO MENTION GOOGLE YOUR ON THE PIXEL 8 AND ARE USING 30 WATT CHARGING THATS NOT FAST CHARGING AN 1HR TO 1HR 30 MINS IS NOT FAST.

NOW YES THE FEATURE THAT WERE SHOWN LOOKS GREAT AND AWESOME BUT IF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE PLAGUED THE LAST TO 2 PIXELS. YOUR NOT GONNA HAVE HAPPY CUSTOMERS
🍎🍏🍏 APPLE LIKE

Great work by Google ❤
❤
What is a photo?

Can I get One.🙂
Pixel in Turkey please 🙌👏
Stop promoting cringing diversity in your ads google
best phone ever
I've booked appointment to sell my kidney 🫣
Hopefully faster charging this year
Lol google is woke
pls release these in Hong Kong🤣
LOG on iPhone...
When you sell pixel in Indonesia?
So you mean we should not TRUST the photo (100 percent fake) post by Pixel anymore ....  kek  Also, what kind of GATE you going to introduce for this PIXEL ? Cant wait for the breaking news XD
My Iphone 8 plus broke down and I am actually impressed by the 8 pro but it costs 1300$ here n India. So the pricing is a bit steep and hence cannot afford it.  But the phone looks amazing with all the new features
with G and AI, it creates MAGIC ✨
Awesome New Features... But, the Best One has to be the 7 Years Guaranteed OS, Security & AI Updates... Hope this time Google made / engineered the Tensor chip better than last year's.
Amazing AI
please come to Indonesia😢
Very expensive in India
built-in vpn (apple crying in corner)
Very disappointed that the screen isn't curved anymore on the PRO. It looked really nice
Watching this from my 4 year old phone. waiting for next 6-8 months for the price drop to buy this masterpiece.
Pixel 8 changed cam video post processing to next level 🎚️..!!
Not buying unless you make a bigger screen like 6.9 inches.
Amazing to see Google made the actual AI 🥳
Best phone ever im in! i always loved google products, their ecosystem is the best
Where is android 14😢
You forgot to write the pronounce , after all, you have to highlight that you have important better than common people. You have elite opinions ! be ashamed
Just saw MKBHD's review, this is actually an upgrade from the last year phone. and I suggest switching to this if you want sleek and minimalist design. (or if you really love android).
I am sorry but camera in pixel 8 pro is scary
Typical Google Garbage 🗑️ Thermometer so you can see how hot your hand has got after holding it 😂
No folds this year?
Google you Beauty 😍🤌🏼
bring Pixel to Mexico 😢
Great phones!
പൊന്നോ... പൊളിച്ച് 😍😍😍 iPhone 3G ആകുമല്ലോ!
Google Just Dropped the Nuclear to the Market
overlooked the fingerprint scanner for another year but i'll let it slide for 7 years of OS, security, and feature drop updates.  Next year though for sure, right Google?
I am living in a lot of trouble
Why is it expensive in India?
I am living in a lot of trouble
Atlast they took a good decision to avoid curved display. Thanks google.
I am living in a lot of trouble
Очень хорошо получилось  дизайне очень хороший телефон
I am living in a lot of trouble
This is awesome. Google literally made mini Jarvis (AI)...
Google does Amazing jobs as ever here. Getting the right direction to AI is revolutionized as you always do. Praise to Google for making us live better.
Awesome 🤟😍
I need help in selling my kidneys guys.
Give me a job in your company
Forget apple, google is silently the new INNOVATOR. ❤
Pixel lovers show up
Give me a job in your company
Give me a job in your company
will the new ai features will come to 7 too or just 8?
Easily the best android phone to recommend to people of any age group
Yayy , now let's go for Samsung witch is a real  high end flagship and will copy all the features while having another ton of grate features that pixels don't
So,goog!e wants its users to create fake photos in pixel 8 phones & spread it on the internet through their social media accounts,very good👍fraudster
Pixel 7 to pixel 8 difference look like iPhone x to iPhone 15 😅😂
Not only 🍎 can do 😅
My jaw definitely didn't drop when the announced it will be getting 7 years of os update
Hey Google! I just watched, live, Google release the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro but nowhere at all did anyone say anything about Android U14 's release date!! When can we expect U14 to come out for us?? I can't stand it!
I want to go to your country🥹
Impressive, but's let see if the speaker has improved haha
Keep asking more and pushing boundaries Google!! 🫶🏻
Im very impressed and way to go google...and im very blown away
CRAZY
Oh God definitely got goosebumps after hearing pixel 8 series will get 7years of os updates that's that's amazing yr ❤Google is doing great and not disappointing with new Amazing features ... Greetings to new pixels😍😍
Bhai 7 yrs is update .. holy moly🙏🔥

I'm in love with this phone, OMG. 😮
My next phone is definitely gonna be a pixel pro.
Please release it in Korea..100,000 Korean Pixel users are hoping for it...
Hope Pixel 8 has better thermal management.
Earphones or watch, that is the question?
When will Android 14 arrive?
If Google improves the battery, this is going to be the best pixel phone ever 👌
i was blown away by the ai features
LETS GO GOOGLE . HAVE A BUMP
Pixel 8 colors suck and are garbage.  Black and gray?  Are you seriously?  Such boring colors in 2023...
Pixel Phones going to the Nxt Level 🔥🫶🏻❤
Comments are NOT turned off. Not like 🍎. LOL
Me when new phone has better camera  🤑🤑🤑

Dear Google, I doesn’t have money to buy ur product but seriously It is better than every phone in this universe ❤❤❤ love from INDIA
How about storage tech? Is it ufs 4.0 in all variants?
❤🎉🎉🎉
Please GOOGLE Pro Mode (Camera App.)Add in all Pixel Devices after Update.
айфон сосёт
Bit more expensive this year . . .
Isn't AI openai's thing
Why are the prices higher?
Pixel Fans🤍
