He looks like Reese from Malcolm in the Middle.
calling them influencers instead of skaters was lowkey dirty🤣🤣🤣not saying it's false tho
MGMT vs Playboi Carti
Good skating session, boy
Erry looking like my Tony hawks underground character
Blueberry Erry looking like a young Rusty Cage
burberry looks like he wouldve won, but he tries so hard to add smooth steez to the end of his tricks that he doesnt even try landing on the board lmao
Hmm, is he in Carti camp now?  We are not sure, maybe ask Google?
i loved mid90s, great to see he's still skating
Atreus on a skateboard was not on my bingo card
Atreus vs a sea urchin

SWAMP
Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life. Repent of your sins and seek a relationship with Jesus while you still have breath in your lungs. 🗣️
Lol wow burberry can do better than that
I wonder how high the ankles of his pants go when he sits down
Atreus vs the opium ambassador
how is this dude considered a model or a stylist he has zero swag
Sunny the modern day twink
Sunny looks just like young Sean Strickland
Bro sounds and looks exactly like the kid from the drawing episode of uncle grandpa
I gotta come back to this vid every now and then
whos the one with ref shirt on and redbull hat
Kratos vs carti next
Nightmare blunt rotation

Never seen Burberry skate. He may not be the best but something about his style seems really smooth, I like it.
Burberry Erry sound like a runescape name
Sunny vs.. THE DARKNESS
kid bronze spotted
Bro lose the weak ass pentagram bullshit.
Boi !!!
Damn that guy sucked as much as Sid playing bass. Now I get the connection.
SUNBURN!
🤨<—- my face the entire video
Does this guy really believe in god and is satanic? Or is he just joking? Like I don’t think he genuinely wants to goto hell, but it’s a real place. Also not to be joked about it’s powerful and everything is energy black and white energy and vibrations are real. Also a fact that The famous satanist, Anton Szandor LaVey’s last death bed words were, “Oh my, oh my, what have I done! There’s something very wrong, there’s something very wrong, there’s something very wrong!”  Matthew 25:46 (NIV bible)  “Then they (the unrighteous) will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life."
Bro he looks like in the mid 90s 😂😂
Sunny didnt even do the hardflip wtf
Burberry Erry might be my second least favorite skater ever (Tim Pool being number 1)
Sunny is crazy looking lol
Sunburn always wins
Damn Atreus be hittin' them moves 🔥🔥🔥
Sunny toe touched on the hard flip
1:21
Why bro pulling up shirtless to a skate battle
Who Here from that one opium video?
Kratos: You are a god, boy Boy: No, I'm a skater
BOY!! WE HAVE TO SHRED!!
Satan will never prosper edgelord ! Easy dub for Sunny 💪🏻
Sunburnnnnn grew upp!!
Was nice to see the satanist get clapped
Горшок жив!
Atreus Vs Hades
Sloppiest game of skate ive ever seen.
they ain't know I'm slick like that yet
That fakie kickflip from BE was hilarious
Atreus is shirtless
Holy crap he looks malnourished 💀
I sometimes come back to this when I want next level second-hand embarrassment.
Wtf is this
That was a switch he flip revert not a switch heel flip 180
Sunburn really up'd his game on skateboarding
0:30 he's just showing off his script reading skills, crazy
Sweet cheeks VS satan’s minion
He missed a kickflip . bruh 😂
Burberry must take a whole day to film his tricks
Con el hardflip lo rre cagaron jajajaj
kidsuper??
Every year I watch this video to boost my confidence and go skate outside. How tf u miss a kickflip
I love the idea of liquid death, glad to see them sponsoring this stuff, that’s cool
This was literally a game of skate at my locals all over again
SUNBUUURNN
Why didn't Sunny Suljic repeat the hard?his foot hit the ground 😂😂😂
atreus vs opium goblin
гений в джорданах кататься
Ain’t that one of cartis groupies
Assuming dude is a satanist. Why?
This is the craziest crossover
Don't expect to live long enough to see Atreus vs The Vampire King and Willy Wonka presenting a Game Of Skate, honestly incredible
Sunny also loves skateboarding shirtless
Sunny is absolutely right to go shirtless to skateboard
one dresses like grandma and the other is one of the emo kids from south park
suljic never did the hard flip
I have to root for an actor and an influencer , the berrics sure changed
панки хой! горшок живой!
When you realize you can dress up like your character in pro skater in real life
Common win for atreus
Atreus is supposed to be looking for the missing giants wtf he doing?
damn sunny is the goat
When did nascar aloe start skating? I can't imagine putting so much into my appearance to go and sweat it all out.
The Rick owens chain is crazy
BATB is getting pretty dank when they start inviting femboys to the game
Cmon with the names! First it was “Versace butt plug” now it’s Burberry Larry” douche chills
sunburn from mid 90s vs playboi cartis best friend 😮
Quemadito crecio
Ofc Burberry doesn’t get a kickflip but he gets tre
Sunnnn burrrrrn
atreus is rad
I’m so glad sunny won!!!
Y’all think Sunny now would be able to hit that gap from mid 90’s on the roof?
Still can’t kickflip 😂  I’d respect Burberry if he can do a basic revert but nah can’t even do that 😭😂
idk but sunny gives off light skin stare energy
erry got the most effortless pop
Imagine selling your soul to satan and still losing at the berrics
Sarah Silverman vs Pink
Blueberry Larry 😂
Lamest skaters I’ve ever seen lmao

Горшок канеш красава, круто катает

We never asked for an Atreus and Emo Island Boy collab, but we got it guys 🔥
Booo.
shoutout to bludlung
burberry every definitely learned to varial flip before a kick flip because the way he misses the basics but can 360 flip like his board an extension of his limbs is crazy
How is bro on here, he missed a kickflip 💀
Burberry erry looks like a girl at the end of a porn
why did the hardflip sunny did count bro the toe drag was huge and the board was scraping
Quemaditoooool

Salvation is found in Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ loves you all
Cacete e omlk de mid90

There’s no way sunny was gonna lose
Was not expecting colm to be hosting this lmao
burberrys skate style is top notch !
I can't take serious anyone that spends that much time making their hair look that bad.
Erry doing tricks in the middle of a flood...  Impressive 🤣🤣
battle of the posers
this dude Eric always wins in this game  XD since we was kids
Burberry's legs☠☠☠
What a tool with the pentagram necklace. Afterward, he will be wearing a pearl necklace.

atreus vs dracula
Damn Sunny is starting to look like a young adult! I just watched Mid 90s for the 2nd time the other day, such a great coming of age film. I also loved him in The Killing of a Sacred Deer
Горшок на доске?
yall hating bruh fr burberry was clean with it
man. what happened to berrics.
Did they pick these kids up from the skatepark down the street?… send them back for more practice. This is the berrics!
the entire vibe of the type of people in this comment section is why I stopped skating lmao bunch of losers with an attitude problem
We got mid90s and opium
Sunny looks just like Louis Garrel
i saw heem big buder
stevie rlly improved
Why is he wearing Jordan’s bruh like cmon you’re not w Carti
Oh my days Sunny Suljic is the voice actor for Artrus in God of War Ragnarok
why does burberry have such weak flips but perfect threes at the treflip?
burberry’s ankles are tiny am I the only one that noticed?
playboi carti and god of war crossover
Burberry Erry (or whatever his name is) really grosses me out. He cosplays as a punker, but has no respect for the ethos of the culture. He’s the definition of a poser, and even worse, he’s a total culture vulture. I bet he doesn’t even know who Duane Peters is. Just utterly disgusting.
I really wish steroids would stop doing Alex Midler.
Never thought Id watch my sleep paralasyis demon skateboard against a shirtless kid
W sunny suljic but whyd they put such a zesty photo on the thumbnail
💀💀
Yeah bro so good vl
idc what yall errys tricks are so smooth
Glad I went to comments lol my guy sunny has two of the most fun hobbies/job ever😂

2 punks battling each other
With the Rick chain on yes sir
1:30  fakie flop
Idk y I was calling the goth kid Burberry terry lmao

It is a fakie backside flip not frontside halfcab. Cab himself has said that is only fakie and frontside.
Two lesbians
2:00
burberry kid blows, trynna look cool. Moron skating in gold toes , genius .
I just wanna know what kind of pants he's wearing.  🔥
yo Sunburn is fuckin insane!
The comments on this video are too funny
[Kratos] Proud of you, Boy.
Burberry wearying some size 15s when he only wears at ten
u cant lie erry got hops ☠️
i don’t think anyone really thought burberry was gonna win
Basically Loki vs Morbius
Burberry erry looks like the dude from the everlong music video 😂

From the comments , I know now that it's Sunny voice in God of war cuz I didn't know   Thank you comments section
holy shit

Do ya'll know that sunny is atreus voice actor in God of war
we just found out who loki is
W
i knew sunny skated but i didnt know it was fr fr like this LMAO. W
God of tricks boiiiiiiii
How did Burberry land a tre flip but not a kick flip
His father seems like a calm and reasonable person
I just want to grab that dude with the spikey hair and hold him up sideways and ram his spikey hair into someones throat
can we just appreciate sunny here
Put Atreus in Skate 4.
Fans will be calling Sunny “BOY” for the rest of his life lol.
BOY!
Bro skates like he is filming instagram clips💀
Is he skating in Jordans?
Boi is the god of skateboarding
boyyyyy
Eboy Sunny doesn't look real since I only see him as Atreus (like many others LOL)
BOOOY!!
The hell loki! You should help your father against mad gods not skateboarding!!
boy does your dad know you're here?
Epech battle
He should just transform into an animal
Bro went to skate instead of finding giants
That dude missed his calling in life of being a musician
No way atreus going toe to toe with King Vamp's greatest loyalist 💀
What are you doing!!! Only Kickflip      if I tell you to kickflip.
kratos will not be happy when he sees this
What's with all these wet blankets in the comments?
BOY?????
the way he hugged sunny kinda zesty
Atreus!
Skate, Boy.
is he the " i am a bitch bro , am justa cocksucker" dud?
"When you ride it, say Skjalva" -Sindri
Ahhh, so this is where Atreus went after Ragnarök
from atreus to a tre flip
Kratos: are you winning boi? Atreus: yes sir
Never in my life I thought I’d see a god of war and playboi carti crossover
BOiiiii on skateboard 💀
So this what Atreus is doing after he left kratos. He said he was going to look for the giants, I guess skate giants
Imagine being able to say "my acting career didn't pan out, so I had to fall back on being a pro skater"
BOY has been trained well
Burberry put up a good battle lol
I knew he’d be gorgeous once grows up
This what Atreus does on his free time when he's on a break looking for other giants
Kratos: Where have u been?  Atreus: I was skating  Kratos: Do not lie to me
makes sense that he can skate, he was literally in a skating film, mid90s
I didn’t know he was actually good
Finding the Giants my ass, Loki out here shredding it instead!
People keeps saying that Atreus is fighting a demon as a demon myself no he doesn't look anything like a demon, more like an antichrist
Kratos: What were you thinking? Atreus: ahhhh… i wanted to visit fenrir Kratos: for two days??!! Do not lie to me! Atreus: ok fine i was skateboarding…. Shirtless…. With a demon….  Kratos: ~._.~
Atreus!!!!!!!!!!¡
Boy was not in Asgard but for he was doing some sweet kick flips
Go BoY!
Do you guys think sunny is tired of the boy memes yet😂
Boy
BOYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Kratos: well done boy Mimir: aye lad ya did great
This is what atreus really meant when he said he had to go and do something without kratos

Badass hair style
these dudes are the complete oppsites of eachother LOL
soft and dark guy
Is that kid bronze in the background ?
Ниче Горшок, в следующий раз получится
Горшок, мы думали ты умер, а ты в США играешь в скейт...
Burberry is still the man, just a great spirit. Sunny was ON IT
Why does Burberry look like a 90s/00s mall goth
Erry is nervous you can tell but it’s ok he’s a really great skater one batb doesn’t determine everything
Anyone else seeing that Burberry can stick the more aggressive tricks with steeze 🧐 it’s like he can do the bigger more technical tricks easer than the minor ones. Kick flip? Haggard! Three flip? Hella steeze!😎
sunny is good at flip tricks....almost in the automatic territory. Who won this tourney?
Sunny status Sunny status live karna
2:47 sketchiest hard flip ever
!!HIS!! Spike hair bro 🙀🧟
r/playboicarti
Reese from Malcolm in The Middle ass boy 🤣
This man's fit is all over the place
lol who the hell r these idiots , nice hair girl boy
горшок?
YOOOO sunny is way better than i thought he lands tricks very clean i think he should enroll in the championship thingies
I love erry’s eyes
burberrys flicks look like there in slo motion
Spent all that time getting his hair ready he forgot to bring his tricks with him
man what did i just watch
Why everybody mad on Burberry?
Erry cant kickflip
sunny didnt do a hardflip. that was SKA.
The Berrics should just bring in junior high kids at this point
This is the new proskaters ?
Surprised to see Kid Super as well!
BEST BATB
Nice move BOY
I am straight and honest but also don’t care what u think anyway these 2 pretty dudes
noobs be like …
if burberry never wore those jordans it would of been a whole different story lmaoo
1 year ago history was made
Lmao spiky head lost to kid actor. Nah but props to ☀️
Isn’t Burberry cartis friend or some he popped out in the sky video
Stick the landing, Boy
The thumb nail looks like two personalities of the same person.
god damn the burberry kid is corny
mid 90s kid and carti’s friend that scams ppl
Jeez, the comments are so toxic..
Kid super
Burberry erry is dog water
The guy with the Satan necklace doesn’t seem like a fun guy..
No way bro this feels like this happened 6 months ago at most. 11 months now though man I’m 18 but feel so old
erry woulda won if he had wlr playing in the background
BOY ! KICKFLIP !
Oh damn i just realized that’s the kid from mid90s
Is this what skating has become ?
I would have shat on these dudes holy coa
горшок реально жив
this almost feels like a fever dream….
sLatt!&!
huh???
cristo vs lucifer
burberry cant skate hes too busy being in carti's clique and getting fucked up
2:42 Never before have the two different styles of hardflips been so clear cut
hehe
this was the day Burberry lost his juice forever
Sunny really got good asf
Primo 360flip allowed?
How and why is Burberry skating in those Jordans
Emo day?
He want to be carti so bad
Having not watched BATB for some years I can say with some confidence that its credibility has almost evaporated. Whoever this Burberry character is, he’s an absolute joke. No flex whatsoever. A mere caricature with mediocre tricks and shite style. Sunny was alright though, I’m glad he came out the eventual winner.
The power of satan compels you… to lose.
Burberry guy can land a hardflip but not a kickflip...
Burberry looks like the guitarist of every 2000s nu-metal band
bro cant even land a kickflip straight
ESE JONAN AHIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
L bozo + ratio + fortnite
These guys look like how I would customize a character in American wasteland
Erry got tres and hardlfips on lock though
Can’t figure out if Burberry is a beginner, or good? Lmao
*What in the hell is a bUrBeRrY ErRy* ? Please elaborate.     God these kids are getting weirder and weirder by the generation. 🤣
[takes single glance at thumbnail] Gee, let me guess...is this from the influencer bracket?  🙄  Sorry about the 3-second view, Berrics.  I know in advance that there's no way I can stomach these washouts.
Lets have it rigth sunnys getting smoked next round
*ATREAS, DO A KICKFLIP BOY*
ETHAN BRADBURY
Que porcaria cara vai aí e parece que não dá nem um ollie direito
4:47 his back foot touch the ground
Awful game
bruh that button up tee is insane 🔥🔥🔥🔥🤦‍♂️
Sunny stealing style lmao
Everyone talking about eric but where your clips at?
sunny did not do the hardfilp the secound time. erry got gipped
I'm confused here.
burberry cant kickflip
Paris Paria Qaria Qariah yang yg Bariag di dunia ini Bariag di dunia ini Bariag 🏭🛹🏭🛹🌎🌏🧑‍🦱✔️🌍🌍🗺️🎰✅🌌🎴🏙️🌅🌆👍🌈🌁🌃🏘️🏡🇲🇨🌇🌥️⛅🛣️🌄🌄💤

Alternate title: Atreus skateboard fights rocker guy
Who's the goth satanist wierdo?

Lets not forget the half cabs went hard
I've never been anybody's fan, but after playing god of war im huge fan od sunny suljic
What in the tony Hawks American Wasteland character creation is going on 😂 dudes got style though 🔥
the tic tac game
They hoed him putting him against sunny
this guy has looked like an Adrien Brody ripoff since conception
It is not every day you se a emo kid skating👍
virtue signal vs virtual virtue signal!!
Oof
These guys look like characters a 10 year old designed on SKATE.
I don’t know if Atreus is this good at skateboarding
this is like playin THPS costumized character but the direction pad on your controller is broken
How has Sunny grown so much in 3 years
If erry didn't care so much about looking like a fuckin covid-19 molecule, he would MAYBE do better.
that rick owens necklace goes crazy
2:45 how is that not a redo? He obviously toe tapped
What up with the guys hair? Weird...
I cringed so hard ITS A FREAKING KICKFLIP
just a reminder none of you are alone ! God is with you all and he will never leave you . you are loved and accepted by him and that will never change . God bless you all<33
Kratos would be proud
Kid can't even kickflip
QUEMADITOOO!!!!!
THAT IS OUR ATREUS OUR BOY! NOT BE SORRY BE BETTER
Burberry jus needs to quit 😭
Mid90s
The majority of skateboarding is more about aesthetic than actual skills. Just like rap. Who's got the dope costume. Geezus
Bro still got the stockx tag on his jordans💀
Y’all for real hating jus enjoy the vid man damn
Sunny suljic my baby😍😍😍😍
Is he wearing superstars highs
Idk why his kick flip is messed up, but his Tre and hard flip is great. What happen 😂
the weakest ive ever seen.
damn atreus
yoo it’s kidsuper
steviegod
We got wonka now???
This spike hair reminds me of old School Tony halk's American wasteland character
Damn Sunburn
🪦 legend
Sunny looking like someone’s lgtbq sister
I wonder how long it takes burberry to make his Instagram clips 😂
Burberry keeps making excuses just because he is bad at skateboarding
The cleanest 360 flip but missed a regular and fakie flip? Kids just pop out of their mom's doing tre's?
Tiktok skater 🤣
Spike man vs square man
I thought the guy from grandma’s boy was going to win.
lol the lvl of these games has really gone down
Ah so thats what chris roberts looks like without a shirt.
I like they put the non-binary trans kids against each other. They’re cute. I had a good time watching, my pronouns are yee-haw.
Seriously Steve? What's going on here? I know your making cash now but come on these guys now?
i hope this isnt what the new skate kids are going to wear.......
Why’s the emo dude skating in shiny leather Jordan 1s lol
Who picked these character skins?
Burberry got like one brain cell, no original ideas and cant beat a 7th grader from NOHO at skate
Technically his name is Burb, Erry Erry
this was not worth the visit to the eye wash station. 😒
Can we get Daewon in a game of skate?!?!
Sunny with burberrys fashion would be 💋🤌
is that 22k kid bronze n killa in the back 👀
I can just imagine Kratos just announcing this: B O Y  VS Burberry Erry
Game sucked
controversial episode
After watching this I'm inn. Call me
How did nobody tell me the island boys battled at the berrics
Who is Burberry Erry? & why is he so bad at skateboarding?
Burberry dude is no where near as good as sunny
this look like a tim burton BATB remix lmfao
Am i out of touch with todays fashion trends?
Burberry Erry looks like the bully in a 00’s Disney Channel movie
Burberry?? lmao more like Michael Kors
Time to bring some real skaters back not these video game characters
Look at how those costume kids look like, look at those tricks and game. Wtf! Now this is the level of the botb, this is what it turnt too. Disappointing fr
I seen burberry back Smith a handrail at ferg one time like nothin that boy good
who tf are these tiny pre-pubescent children?
Who ?
No way that kid ways more than 100lbs
He really kept the StockX tag on the mids 😂😂😂
This bracket is🔥🔥🔥
Berrics just letting ANYONE play these days🤣🤦‍♂️
Are these dudes from tiktok or something
I saw the stockx sticker on his board I said probably he's into sneakers, then saw him skating with Jordans, this kid wants to look cool. Then saw the stockx badge on the Jordans and said what the hell?
What the actual heck
He can land everything accept a kickflip lol
They look like when you build your own character on skate..
I’m so glad the emo with daddy issues addicted to consumerism for clout lost.
These kids today look like catroon characters
Damn merked from the start
Give him hel, boy! *literally*
BOY!
Why is the ref the sauciest kid skater to grace the planet, besides nyjah of course 🤦🏾‍♂️
Do a kickflip Burberry
Maybe if he wasn’t so worried about his fit he’d have time for skill
1:30 idk why but that was really funny
What do they say after mercy on your souls??
Sunny Suljic Vs. Covid-19
Burberry is so ass bruh
Not tryna be mean, but are these just two dudes from some skate park?
New gen love it
Sunny vs kader would be amazing
Burberry look like he's going to a Good Charlotte concert tonight
Imagine falling and impaling yourself with your dope necklace
Omg the comments are killing me 💀💀💀
Deciding who from that video is less likable is more challenging than that kickflip. Dog collar poser tool, hat hero hobo or Steve Berra... Damn.
mider with the 3 inch pidler
That StockX tag gave me cancer
I knew that Burberry blue juice or whatever sucked at flatground lol
It's strange.. they are not very good, and quite good at the same time. Some hard tricks no problem and some easy tricks very sketchy.  Haha still better then me anyways so good game!
Burberry erry is the biggest schmuck in skateboarding
Wtf this is Atreus?
like si pensaste que era Luisito el comunica.
Kratos would be like:  BOII. WHERE IS YOUR SHIRT?!
Bless you all amen
Hdh
Less outfit and more skating please, this is BATB i mean the quality is supposed to be a little higher
Why topless? And why this joke of skater Burberry Erry?

2:47 😐💀
sunny ate him alive
Kook vs Kook
Burberry is just Reese from Malcolm in the Middle
I mean Sunny is a god it shouldn’t surprise anyone that he won
Looks like he’s been practicing since the 90’s
Burberry vs Sunny. . . Skaters have the coolest names
Ala o cara que faz o Atreus kkkkkkkk
How they let him redo it after he did a trick that was done already…? BS
Frodo 🔥
Boy
BOY!!!!!
Boy
BOYYY
I'm really glad that he works with Santa Monica again. Our boy Atreus has grown up :)
Well done boy
Now I know what Atreus is up to.
BOI
Kratos would be proud
he has a hairection
Probably the Stock X tag that made him lose
I dunno who Burberry is but soon as I saw him it reminded me of that kid Hawk from that Karate kid show Cobra Kai, I'm sure they have very similar background stories.
Just look at the leader board @ the end of vid . Kyro vs Griffin Aaron's fucked from round 1
Who ?
This was battle of the berries emo edition
Is Burberry a kind of punk trapstar?? Hahaha so sick
"Frontside halfcab kickflip" we call those fakie fs flips where i live.
So all 800,000 of y’all didn’t see that massive toe touch on mid 90’s hardflip!? I mean soundcloud guy is pretty harsh but…….
Damn I took my eyes off these boys for a second and now they're old
2 months later and still in first round 😓
Can you kickflip? No but but but I can tre flip!
Burberrys boots look 4 sizes too big
So dude dudes who are mad at their dads... Ok
burberry ankles are some skate 3 glitches
The three first battles' participants tide the same stance, coincidence?
Пин я тебя вижу...
u know ur a trendy skater when all u can land are tres and 3 shuts LMAO
So the devil lost in skate while wearing air Jordans lol  do better.
When u make it to a batb and can't kickflip 😭
Не знал, что Моргенштерн и Горшок хуярят на бэрриксе.
them fresh j's with the x tag still on LOL
NASCAR aloe just got beat by sunburn
Great to see Kratos’s BOY doing well
“I think it’s uhhhh u go again?”😂😂
Man I think I could beat Burberry in skate
2:47 bad toe drag tho
I guess this time God didn't have mercy on Burberry's soul
*SUNBURN!!*
Host is such a douchebag lolololol
Is that the kid from mid 90s?
the way burberry forms his heelflips scares me
do a kickflip
Burberry actually produced for playboi Cartis givenchy ad
Burberry looks like a custom character from THPS.
Size 7 foot wearing size 14 sneakers
they both have fire hair 🔥
Sooo when did we lose Steve and gain this dude who can’t read? like I want pros to judge this crap not a random dude lol it’s like the new age took over and don’t have it on lock
3:41 hum
little dude from the movies look so different now damn
Kid supper 💫💫💫💫😯
Wtf is going on here
Atreus pro skater
I want versace plug to be on here
Burberry look like a goth version of the villain from spy kids I swear 💀
I would like to know if the original adidas superstar is good to skate I can't make up my mind
Burberry got some insane ollies
Here to see how Atreus will look in Ragnarok
Redo the Shaun hover vs Sean Davis game, or give the win to Shaun hover since Davis clearly cheated
I like the fact that he misses a kickflip bit does sketchy Tres
Phat
Only if there were grinds
Bam didn’t even wanna be there lmao
How can someone do a 360 flip but struggle with a kickflip...I've never seen that before.
jamie griffin is the boogeyman on this list, bet the house he’s gonna win
Damn this was already a month ago thats crazy😂
Yeah this ones a lil weird
Goes to show Instagram is not real life, just practice and have your own fun
I dont think burberry wanted to be there lmao
I hated everything on this video, including the presenter.
sunny looks like a bi-sexual elf
1:16 tf’s going on back there with sonny and the other dude 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why are you wearing Jordan 1s for skateboarding? 🧐
Burberry Perry mad asl rn
превью: моргенштерн против горшка
Dude wear shoes that actually work. Wtf
I know Burberry can skate but he looks exactly what Karens think skaters look like
Burberry would’ve won if he was able to throw his board after his tricks
kick flip LMFAO
Why does Burberry get so much hate?
he is better behind drums
rigged
hahaaa Burberry’s totally a fashion punk😂
All these posers talking shit on Burberry erry when they probly can't even do half the stuff he does
Satanists skating with satanists. Nothing new
Wtf is this
Yo what the hell happen to sunny lol
BIGSPIN 😈😈😈
I have such a big crush on sunny
So this is what atreus is doing after scattering his mother's ashes...    Well done BOI
Bruh is trash 🗑
This shit aint the same no mo fuck this
Sunny lands them almost everytime
Sunnys style is actually sick!
Burberry erry was trying so hard to be cool that he forgot how to skate.
honesty props to burberry that was one of the nicest backside heels i’ve seen
Burberry got hoed lmaooo guess it’s different landing shit on the spot and not spending all day making a 3 truck edit with those ugly ass shoes 😂😂😂
Battle of the emos
Damn so i guess he cant kickflip 😂😂
Punk hairstyle in 2021🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
These are the most alien looking skaters Ive ever seen lol 😂😀
Sunburn
Burberry "2001" Erry
Note to self for next BATB video: don’t read the comments before finishing the video - rookie me 🤦🏽‍♂️
Luisito comunica de refery
That’s sunny???
this man Sunny look like he wearing mascara hahahah
Crowd in the background is lame.
@1:15 u can see sunny and Alex kissing in the corner
Burberry looks like the older brother from Little Vampire lmaooo
Does that Burberry guy even actually skate? 😂 I hate even looking at that fucking dude
Damn there must be a lot of pros in this comment section? The way niggas talking 🤦🏽‍♂️
have you ever seen anyone land in primo and pinch it out like that? 2:20
what kind of pants did sunny use
Burberry looks like he fills in for jimmy urine at msi concerts
Once I seen Burberry's brand new, never walked in, don't fit, straight out the box shoes.....I knew it was over.
Хули тут делает горшок из короля и шута ????
BOI
sunny vs darkness
literally battle of possers xd
those shoes were too big
The winner should’ve got the other persons necklace lol 😂
is that a jojo refrence
that announcer dude’s collet was bothering me so much
love this episode
Worst game of all time. What’s the trend of skating non skate shoes that are 5 sizes too large?
burberry will always be the goat
burberry needs some smaller shoes lol
i thought the first kickflip was just a fluke but i dont think kickflips are his specialty
These battles have sucked ass. How cheap.
sunny just marked bro out
Man still had that stock x tag on those 1s lol
Maybe burb needed to wear proper skate shoes and tie them up a bit 🤔😁
It's crazy hoy burberry erry can nollie tre flip first tey but not even kickflip
The trendy battle 📲 💔
Darth maul vs Luke Young Obi one
feel like if burberry wore skate shoes and ditched the necklace he would’ve landed a few more tricks. not trying to be an asshole, just genuinely trying to help dude out
Never heard of this blueberry kid… I see why he lost..
I’m not going to lie, Burberry looks like one of the bombs used to take out submarines
Bro sunnys necklace tho
And the host is: Luisito Comunica
bored pnk
VINNIE BAHN!!!!!!!!
Damn the kid from stranger things just beat Chris Angel Mind Freak, what a show
No lie this GOS was as wack as their outfits.
what in the emo
Man Burberry should have warmed up. You can see how much he got better throughout the game... But it was too late by then
Why is he wearing the stock X tag lmaoo
that spikey hair douche bag 🤣🤣
Sunnys switch front heel was so clean my god
ALX LMAOO
2:45 Even he knew he toe dragged
Someone know where can i find the necklace that Sunny is wearing??
Someone know where can i find the necklace that Sunny is wearing??
Those Jordan's look hella big is that why he missed the kickflip
sunny so fine
new generation of skaters 🤔
L. Ron. would be proud
Goth kids rock Nikes now, huh?
I wonder what Burberry smells like?
That blueberry guy its a secret character straight outta tony hawk game
Somethin about erry pisses me off
Did they get a fucking elf to read the rules lmao
hahahaha, i feel bad for burberry his prolly pretty good just nervous. wonder how long it takes to get his hair done every morning tho.
kid super
this is the worst battle in batb
These guys aren't very good at skateboarding.
Bingo night at retirement homes probably go crazier than this
just a reminder that a fakie frontside 180 is not a frontside half cab. carry on.
F*cks sake.  this is/was sh*t.
First time seeing this erry dude with out the strobeck angle  :D
If they allowed no complys and a place to slappy this would of been different
Got my money on kid from mid 90s and god of war that’s a flex
Mans got thorns 3 on his helmet
this feels like watching wii skate if that was a thing
I already knew who'd win when Burberry didn't land that kick flip
3:33 it confuses me how different the same trick can look for two different people
Atreus from God of War, is in BATB.. let’s goooo
Don’t mess with the swazey
wait roy Purdy is alive that man disappeared of the face of the earth
I wonder if he bang his head, those thorns would've killed him instantly
Wasn’t the crazy hair guy dead?
Vi tantos games fodas que vejo uns que até desanima kkkkk
He blowed
Bro wtf is this batb🤦‍♂️ what’s the theme on this one?
Am I the only one that thought Burberry’s bs big spin was just too clean
LOL his fakie flip couldn't have been more unimpressive
Kidsuper 🐐
Not tryna be a hater, but this shit was weak af….
These guys suck !!! Not even hating...
Idk that hardflip should’ve been redone by erry bc that’s gotta be two diff tricks. My friend Josh has been trying to learn hardflips and he does them the way erry does them and I hate to count it in a game of skate bc I do them the way Sunny does and actually flicks the board to make the trick happen rather than jumping and pressure flipping the board almost. I dunno. It’s just weird that some people count it as a hardflip even though it’s done in two different ways. Don’t mind counting it that much but then again I do hate counting it bc it’s obvious that I flick it and my friend just pops it all in the back foot rather than using both, very weird
This is the greatest game of skate ever
I bet so much money Burberry would skate better with some normal skate shoes
They’ll just let anyone into the berrics
Burberry went so easy on him. He was barely even trying. That dude can kill it.
That dude is dressed really weird.
Tbh there’s just something about burberry errys attitude and vibe that makes him seem like a bad person
Burberry has cool hair
This looks like a game of skate between him and blink 182 lmao
this was weak. too weak
Battle of clowns
Great battle?
What are these comments.... Everyone a comment gangster insulting one or the other based on looks, filming style, or whatever else? Toxic pieces of **** -.-
"i think its uh... you go again.. ?"
watched this a million times i wish it was longer
Yeeeeaah boy
weird hair sucks
Curti aí galera sou brasileiro.
I don’t know who either of these two are
Damn didn’t turn out the way I expected
Wish Loki from sun of the mask
*Pro Tip when watching BATB:* Don't look at the duration of the vid
so glad that punk kid got smoked. I like most female skaters over him, he has such garbage style
god damns burberry's outfit is fucking atrocious , no self awareness at all
Sls games are better and plus I don’t think Burberry can flick his tricks with those shoes
Sunny rules
Dudes be wearing chokers nowadays damn sunny
the dude is EDGY omg so much edge
Not entertaining at all, I’d rather watch paint dry
This is a joke on skateboarding and the berrics themselves for allowing this. Absolute joke
I haven’t skated in 2 years and I’ll hop on a board and beat both these misfits!
Absolute garbage!!!
the comments here are worse than the skating in this video
What shoes is sunny wearing?
Burberry reminds me of a youthful more confused Furby
i love when we all think it’s over but it’s not. what a beautiful moment
WTF happens to Skateboarding !? :`(
edgy boys
wtf was that?!
im betting the house on jamie griffin, these niggas stand no chance lmao
wtf i could win this battle XDD
Burberry’s shoes are the worst skate shoes ever tho
Am I the only one who cant stand the shrugged shoulders, gangsta fake style.
Erry do not be in field .. now u see the difference
Yooo andy shrock vs john hill is gonna be classic
you would at least expect burberry to land a kickflip... this gave me cancer
2:46 and 3:07 dont repeat? 🤣🤣
This gotta be the worst game of skate I’ve seen in years s/o sunny tho
clearly not influencing people with skateboarding
The absolute state of skateboarding.
I guess the crowd knew what to expect before anyone else did
Tom Asta was right in his stream….skating without a shirt in that hall was a bit weird :D
influencer fails
Burberrys filmer must get so burnt from him taking 2 years just to land his flatground in a line
Daddy Kratos is so proud of you,  B O I
congratulations , super cool
Here for the comments...
Que tristeza ese man tan malo, solo ig ese pelo parado  😂😂😂
What is that? Most of our "Game of Skates" at our local were more technical than that. What happened? The spikey guy's Kickflip are horrible rockets XD
He is lucky he has a weird face
Ngl this batb was boring
1:55 akthesavior on the back
This shit is a joke now
the old gen is the best
pls kid bronze 😂
this is such clut shit
mr fashion lmaoooo prolly need addy to make an edit
put yo damn shirt on sunny
just shows you that you  don't need skill when you have  a million 12 year olds who follow you instead
Exposing the real from the fake. There's no reshoots in BATB and that's why Burberry Erry took a HUGE L.
1 looks like a tony hawk character the other looks like he cries when hes frustrated
Burberry Erry is literal trash
Those big ass shoes made blueberry fail the kick flip
Colm is a living fucking legend
Sunny is not even pro yet either. Kid is going to be a monster
I couldn’t even finish this video. They are only here to get kicked out anyway.
erry looks like kenpachi from bleach
This felt so good seeing him lose
spiey hair bro came here from the 90s
For those that may not know…Sunny also does mocap and voice for Atreus in God of War 4
Only 6 months until the final.
Yo im so sad 😭though I already felt like sunny gon win😵‍💫😵‍💫, wanna let you know Burberry you are so cool!!!! 🔥🔥Your trick looks so much better then suljuc’s even the nollie 360 flip tail scrape was better!! 🤯😳I’ve watched this match like 10 times and cried every time  唔好傷心呀你 下次再努力過！！ I mean im not a big fan of you but your content straight killsss💀💀🔥 Hope your ankle heals soon mannnn 😞😞  (Btw I disliked every hate comments🤬)
Bad game…
Shoes are so big😂
stop wearing stockx tag
bruh,first they take out Versace Plug in the first round, and then Burberry :(
Why is no one talking about how fucking wild Sunnys hardflip looked? That shit looked dope as hell.
Hmm  your boy failed on a kick flip?   That's just standard everytime trick.
who are these guys ? haha
Who are these people? Who is in BATB12? Anyone recognizable?
Skate life forever!
damn erry is not good at kick flips wtf
Dude looks like my create a character off tony hawks underground 2.
gooo *sunny*
No aplaudan gracias
the battle to determine who gets fed to garrett ginner
What kind of skate deck does Burberry erry skate
eu ganhava!!
If they allowed no-complies this would actually be interesting.
I eat burberry every mornin....
looks like a clowns playing skateboard xdddd wtf is this styles...
That Burberry dude is cringe. Sunny had some style man
Nyjah is gonna win the whole thing 😴😴
battle of the biggest shoes
Since when can you try a new trick instead of re doing your trick... Am i missing something?
Find sum locals that would smoke both 😂
Go baby sunburn
I kinda miss when that feeling when a skater would pull a trick you've never even seen out of nowhere. That's why this shit was so good for so long. And those skaters still exist, but I guess they don't have enough clout
Burberry erry has more style but I was going for sunny all day
burberry poser cant even kickflip lol
Half that crowd thought they were too cool to cheer and hype it up at the beginning
Why the spiky haired 90s goth kid so bad at kick flips?
Grateful Dead vs Deicide
O Sunny tá mudando mt, mlq dahora.
Remember in the death blow when erry said i don't wanna choke, i don't wanna get skunked, and i don't wanna make a fool out of myself? 😅 well you accomplished 1 of the 3 i guess lol
It should be a crime to wear Jordan 1’s with jeans cuffed above them
YO I KNEW I RECOGNIZE SUNNY HE PLAYS IN MIS 90s
Im curious if you can do some freestyle tricks like caspers, primo tricks etc. Rules says nothing about it but I have never seen anyone do this in BATB
I didn't know Faze Jarvis could skate ⛸️ mad props
sunny killed it
how they able to skate with chokers on
Man, a lot of the influencer bracket seems like a meme
ok, this was so confusing... i was like "oh, cool, a batb with a couple ams i didn't know of... but wait, why is that one caring about his fashion over his skating? shoes too big, weird edglelord chain, etc..."  then i looked up who they were and it all made sense. why give airtime to influencers is my question? doesn't have his own youtube channel to cram his trendyconsumerism?
Burberry must’ve tried so hard to hype himself up as he was spiking his hair this morning
Sunny best guy 🔥
Insta skaters must be crying
take off the stockx tag
Someone cut off the StockX tag
this is a hilarious crowd
Burberry sucks go back to insta
anyone know what shoes sunnys wearing
Burberry look like he’s in pro skater being controlled by someone’s mom.
Burberry got that style though 👌 skate wise , I'm neutral on his get up
This doesn't look like a batb game
говорили же что горшок умер че за хуйня
if burberry erry wore shoes that were designed for skateboarding i bet it would be alot easier
cringers
Ref had to re 3 tricks
So one guy is the kid from that movie. What does the other kid do? And what does all of this have to do with scientology? I'm so old and out of touch.
How does he even skate with that chain on, seems like a safety hazard
Super edgy kit brooo
No one gonna speak about sunnys toe tap off the floor on one those tricks
wow sunny cooked that dude
burberrys instagram is straight catfish i think!
Game dos bizarros
Горшок жив
BURBERRY ERRY THE CLOUT CHASER VS SUNNY SULJIC THE KID THAT IS ACTUALLY A GOOD ACTOR AND SKATEBOARDER
Burberry should stop wearing big shoes nowadays looks like bigfoot on his feet
wtf is this?
Brutal…and if your that punk the fact you wear Nikes makes you a huge poser
Ewwwwwww. This is a stain on berrics lol
These guys suck
Does spikey not practice flip tricks? Looks like he’s got all the big spin/shuvit variations down packed.
Strangest batb face off yet
Why am I watching a Skate competition between two of the emo kids from South Park?
$1000 sneakers won't teach you how to kickflip lmao
Ngl I thought Burberry would DESTROY sunny
Lol erik
batb cyberpunk 2077 edition
These kids aren’t that good at skating
the influencers bracket gonna be trash
LLLLLLLLLLLL
my son is better than that spikey dude. i mean in choosing shoes sizes..
DO A KICKFLIP!!! 😂
Burberry’s choice of necklace for skating is sketchy.
hellraiser just barely rolled away from a fakie flip...
Someone give that hobbit a shirt
that blink 182 hairs i thought i would never see again
Sunny drippy asf
I honestly thought Burberry was gonna do better
Hahaha wtf is this
Worst
it's not the shoes scratching burberry's deck ..it's the deck who scratch the burberries shoes
dude uses jizz for that hair
this is so cringe phahayhah i cant
who the fuck ride skate with a fucking aj1 bro lol
Feel bad for the ref on this one...
burberry’s style better
Today’s matchup is “the Fruit & the Brute”   Lol just playin

Kid super!
No “bonelessness” LMFAO
God bless everyone
Hire that hat guy.
i need an ID on sunnys necklace lmao
And here I am thinking scene kids went extinct
He just took a letter on a flip
Sunny cooking up damn 👨‍🍳
That’s the kid from the mid 90s movie right? Damn I could barely recognize him
Burberry is a Instagram skater
why does the right guy look like the main singer of mindless self indulgence when he was young
Wtf
Looking like opiate addicts
Poor Midler, it must have been like having to babysit 2 kids arguing about who was less sketchy at birthday party at a rented out indoor park....
It's that guy from good Charlotte
What an edgelord.
Boyy!!
I call toe touch on sunny on the hardflip
Kid did a good job in mid 90s, cool that he skates for real.
wtf is this
Who VS who ?
Not gonna lie Burberry makes me wanna skate to Papa Roach
Repent and turn to Jesus Christ of Nazareth before it’s too late
I got worse watching this
Berry has some tricks real nice
my dude Burberry looked like he was wearing shaq's shoes
Damn, I didn't realize Sunny is an actor. Cool. Good on him. Kid shreds.
damn this is what skating is now getting views? so sad no one where was there cause real pros know this is shit right here  , its sad they put these peoople on just cause they have a high  follow count you do know they can pay for that... #savethegameSKATE
Difference between Nike basketball shoes and Nike SBs bud
Damn Sunny grew up fast
Where did the South Africa video go?!
That kickflip whooped Burberry Errys ass didn’t it
Wait how is Luan not an icon???
Sunny looks like such a poser. Kids that dress like that are The chads of skateboarding
BOY?!
Pathetic...
This was weak as hell. Come on now. Now I think, “how long does it take these foo’s to film a Instagram edit”
I once saw sunny at my local skatepark
Why are No Complies etc not allowed? inb4 "not real tricks blabla"
F*** I hate the rules in the Skateboarding. #Vallelyrules
Burberry only for instagram...  #SMH
BOY WINS
Cringe
Can’t wait to watch the finals in a nursery home when I’m old and senile!
Sunny is so sick, one of my favorite of the newer guys! Burberry is dope too, unfortunate that he got nervous
Hahahahahahahahahaha
This whole scene seemed pretty sad.
sunnys been on the xans
THIS WAS SO FUCKING ASSESS BURBERRY A CLOWN LMFAO
This reminds me of round 1 in the movie dodgeball
Can’t wait to watch the finals in a nursery home when I’m old and senile!
These kids look lost 😞 smh
Even tho I feel like sunny is a skater before an actor. Shout out to Loki for winning his first round!
👍👍👍
Hey brothers and sisters, I love y'all and it's just been in my heart today to share that Jesus love y'all so much and unconditionally. I don't know how much time we left on this earth before Jesus comes, but I want all of us to be ready when He does. Let's leave these things of this world behind for in scripture it says in Matthew 24:35 that heaven and earth will disappear, but my words will never disappear. " Also in 2 corinthians 4:18" So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal." Time is so short. And I always say this" I want all of us to be saved. " Jesus is coming back soon." with tears in my eyes I love you guys. Let's take Jesus and His words seriously in these time were in. I know the road isn't easy because there are so much distractions and temptations in this life. But through prayer and fasting we can overcome them. I'm not trying to force anything on anybody or even force to do something they don't. Everyone has their own choice whether to read or ignore this message. But I'm sending this message to all out of love, because if you were to see your mother about to get hit by a big truck, you would do everything to try and save her because you love her and if you didn't, it show that you don't love her. So I do the same thing for us about the wrath of God that is to come. I don't want anyone I love, know/don't know or even those who hate or dislike me to face such things. Because I know every soul is precious to God and are valuable to Him. Because before we were born He knew us, He knitted us in our mother's womb, He called us to be His children . His love for us is so great and so strong, it's beyond human comprehension, that even the angels in heaven don't understand it. So I want to tell you it's time to get ready, time to prepare ourselves for the Second Coming of Christ, for the trails and tribulations and for the rapture. As you can see, so many people have turned away from God. The world has become so immoral, wicked, disgusting and violent. Killing people without any care or heart. And that shows that the love of God is growing cold in the hearts of people. Please be ready friends, for when the Son of Man comes. Time is running out. Let's not leave this world with regrets. Because I tell you this, my biggest regret is not knowing Jesus Christ earlier. I love you Guys and Jesus loves you too, that's why He didn't think twice about dying on the Cross for us, knowing that we may not even love Him back. Please take what was said today in consideration because ready or not Jesus Christ is coming back believe it or not Jesus is coming back.   How to be saved? To be saved, a man must confess that Jesus is Lord while acknowledging in his heart that Christ must have full rule over his life and that he died on the cross for our sins and was resurrected on the third day🙏🏾. Also one must repent and turn away from thier sin.   Prayer of Salvation in Jesus Christ🙏  Dear Lord Jesus, I know that I am a sinner, and I ask for Your forgiveness. I believe You died for my sins and rose from the dead. I turn from my sins and invite You to come into my heart and life. I want to trust and follow You as my Lord and Savior. Amen  Spreading the Gospel on every content on YouTube 🙏❤️.
burberry erry doesn’t have a lotta tricks but his his tre, hardflip, and bs heel looks mad clean ngl
They both were so nervous you can just tell lol
John 3:16-17 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen.
Why so much hate
horrible style this generation! I recommend to watch berrics 1 mike mo skate. He was the best all the time! Every trick is perfect! And this berrics 1 was about 10 years ago or more!
Why are thses guys here and not someone like Jonny Giger?
it’s good to see humans skate
Bulberry 💩
Don't ever let that guy read the rules again.
Luisito Comunica en skate bord
looool
That was unexpected I only know if sunny from the movie I didn’t know he was this good
burberry is so steezy
I can just hear Kratos cheering Sunny on. "Finish him Boy"
burberry deberia usar zapatillas de su talla XD
How tf did this make trending
whats with the stock x product placement on the kid that things he is heavy metal
homies are too damn concerned about what they look like, that the skating just all goes out the window..
Toe on that hard flip lol
1:11 for those who can't stand rules...
Why would you use a fucking stockx sticker on your board
Noddy Holder hasn't aged a single day by the looks of it!
O que o skate virou? Meu Deus
These guys are " influencing" me to not watch them.

It is insane to me that these two are in BATB. Berrics is really not what it used to be... Koston get out while you still can lol
We needa see a kader vs sunny
simping for the ref
Is this the goth kids round, lmao.
I feel like if Burberry erry wore different shoes he’d skate better
Atta boy Sunny!!
This is a huge upset
we have a message from god, jesus spoke it's in the bible new testament
Burberry looks like those dudes from those early 2000s Nu Metal bands
Tibet is a region in Asia that is currently under Chinese occupation. Everyday, the Tibetan people along with their deep history and culture face the risk of cultural genocide as they continue to be repressed and even killed. You can help by speading awareness about Tibet, writing to your representatives, and donating to Tibetan organizations. Thank you for your time
This is funny 😂😂😂😂
Itd be cool if Burberry wasnt trying to do the tricks in ways so he wouldnt ruin his shoes. Thats why he couldnt do the simplest of tricks like a kickflip 😂
Also y'all hating on Burberry but bro he doesn't care with yall. It's his persona
Didn't expect sunny and burbbery.ery would do a duel 😭
but that means that if he makes a trick and falls on his head, it means that his haircut is ruined
Is this dude skating in retro 1s, sheesh
Can’t wait to watch the finals in a nursery home when I’m old and senile!
These three together just remind me of bowling for soup highschool never ends music video..
Style, WACK.
Please tell this man to use his back foot better
Super glad I don’t have to look at Burberry again. Go Sunny ☀️
hey alex
Whats with the gimmicky shit
´My boy from Stranger Things is doing great outside of the tv show
Sun burn's a natural ayyy
Burberry looks like he has no legs and is just pants then nothing then shoes lol
💀💀💀
influencers suck
Man this just reinforces the fact that skateboarders suck soo bad
Bruh they both wearing shoes 2 or 3 sizes too big 🤣😂🤣
It was over after that kickflip attempt
Please upload more videos jfc
BURBERRY is one of the worst ground maneuvers.
It be your own shoes😔
Burberry’s shoes too big that’s what if us
they should not of counted sunnys hardflip he toe tapped hella
that dude readin the rules must have had some cariuma crack with the pace this shits going
It wasnt That Bad goddamn stop Hosting would be Boring of Therme where only top Tier battles
After seeing this shit the berriscs is dead for me. What a shame.
*"EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED."* *"**CoDmObI.MoNsTeR**"* *"**CoDmObI.MoNsTeR**"* *"**CoDmObI.MoNsTeR**"* *”DID IT HELP YOU TOO?”* *CERTIFIED CLASSIC* *CERTIFIED* *CLASSIC*
kickflip
This proved that Burberry is just a trash ass Instagram skater🤣
Blueberrys insta clips must take years to film, maybe he was just nervous
The kid from mid90s wtf
That shit was garbage!!!
i stg burberry has no flick in those shoes
The skaters look like THPS Characters IRL.
BROOOO SSUUUUUUUUNNNNNNYYYYY BOY WAS SKATING FUUUUUCKKKIIII****** SLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWW
that burberry style kinda sucks, srry to say
JESUS said in JOHN 3:3 ye MUST BE BORN AGAIN to enter the KINGDOM of GOD, it's a spiritual rebirth and transformation upon accepting and believing the LORD JESUS CHRIST. if one dies not being BORN AGAIN, they will end up in the place that was prepared for the devil and his angels (MATTHEW 25:41) in the place of outer darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. (HELL/SHEOL/HADES) but we don't have to go there, THE bible says in ROMANS 10:9 "CONFESS WITH YOUR MOUTH THAT JESUS CHRIST IS LORD, AND BELIEVE IN YOUR HEART THAT GOD RAISED HIM FROM THE DEAD, AND YOU SHALL BE SAVED."  PEOPLE PERISH WHEN THEY REJECT THE FREE GIFT OF GOD, THE WAS OFFERED THROUGH JESUS CHRIST. TO REJECT JESUS IS TO REJECT SALVATION. JESUS CHRIST IS THE ONLY WAY TO HEAVEN, NO OTHER WAY, NO OTHER PATH. THERE IS ONLY ONE NAME GIVEN TO US WHERBY WE MUST BE SAVED (ACTS 4:12)

That chain is the cringiest I've ever seen
Sunny looks like a chick
erry got smoked
Why Burberry have a wallmart board? 😂😂😂
⚡
Sunny didn't do a Switch frontside 180 heelflip he did a Switch heelflip frontside 180 pivot which shouldn't have counted.
Really thought Burberry was gonna try hard
Deshawn Jordan will win the finals
Горшок ??
Homie can’t even kickflip
I'm just glad these styles haven't died out, love liberty spikes!
I can win erry probably. And, maybe even sunny. They are pretty shit
BATB going downhill fast... giving away all that cariuma money to church of Scientology
That douche nozzle sitting with his shirt off is soooo cool
What is happening. Im so disconnected from tiktok.
YEASSASSS
thats what you get when you stake with Jodans  on lmfao emo kid.
Who is that announcer dude? Dill’s little brother? Shit, could be Dill’s son
Burberry Erry's heelflips were smooth as hell and I like how weird he looks. Sunny's tricks were looking crispy as hell, too.
It's crazy how everybody is complaining about there only being two battles per week. First, that's how it's always been, so shut up. And The Berrics don't owe you little turds a god damn thing, so shut up.
That was some 🗑️
This guys sucks
dude what happened to burberry
In the thumbnail I clicked because I thought sunny was a chic
It’s the shoes 😂👀
Burberry dude obviously didn’t win bc they weren’t using an iPhone to film
Burberry better hope StockX knows the Heimlich after choking like that
Sunny’s pop is insane
Yo this is my first look a this year of BATB and this shit is nutty
The spikes are gaaaaaaaaaaaaiiiiiiiii
Its refreshing to actually be able to SEE Burberry skating
everyone involved has the personality of a dish rag. most boring, unenergetic crap I have ever wasted 4 mins of my life viewing.
The steez on that 1:28
That was a weak ass fakie flip
Bro there’s no way Burberry messed up on a kick flip
Man woke up and said what’s the worst pair of shoes I can skate in.
Skaters are turning into the things we hated back in the day.. I can predict all their tricks cause ppl are fucking shills now.. 360 flip is also played out and I would destroy all them with varial tricks cause they avoid them like an incel avoid pussy..
get Yuto on here
the fun part about this is you can tell absolutely nobody wants to be there.
this had wack vibes
Tony Alva's back? :-)
Where was the 360 one foot?
ugh burberry erry is whack. sunny's not the most the most talented skater, he's young and he's still learning, but he fucking SMOKED him! hell yeah sunny!
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates 🎈
Sunny vs Garrett whos gonna win
Kratos will most certainly not approve of atreus’s fit
How do you miss a kick flip😂
That was a challenging watch 👎
Good job boy
the fuck is a frontside half cab
This match was actually better than I expected it to be
Let’s be real tho. Probably 1/3 of those followers are bots/fake. I knew some people in college... fitness types. They told me how it works. You can pay a company to give you followers
What the actual fuck. Bro berry is ass as fuck 😭😭😭😭 homeboy can’t kickflip?
My boy needs to get some Jay's two sizes smaller
This is the difference between kids who flex on insta and real pro skaters.
Batb became into a circus, Bad idea Berra
What is this weak shit?
Justice for burberry
battle of the berrics
He’s come on along way since Mid 90s. He could only ollie.
Damn shadow from sonic really sucks at flatground
Luan vs Shane finals👻
yeaaaaah😵
What’s up with the hair lol is it 1996? 🤣
haha no one was pumped
😂
Dude is "punk" but rocking Off White and J's 🤔 Dope battle regardless of interesting attire selection.
Can’t wait to watch the finals in a nursery home when I’m old and senile!
só tem emo nessa porra vsf
I expected COVID to have more of his tricks on lock.
Burberry Erry is such a poser.....
2:47 NO FOOT ON THE GROUND XDDDD
willy wonka
Burberry is so shitty I could easily beat him in skate bru
Skater instagram burbbery
White playboi carti groupie vs child that looks like bird who skated for one of the worst teams aesthetic wise of all time
Holy shit I just got launched into the past of questionable style choices and I like it
Damn sunny straight smacked this foo😂
Wait isn't that the kid from God Of War?
Battle of the kooks
Hahahaha skateboarders are so spoiled. Oh no, we have to wait for a while for our free footage. Oh the horror. Oh no, there are some people playing skate who are still better than 90% of posters but they are not pros. Oh the horror.
sheesh talk about edgelord lmao
sunny shows up w no shirt and a collar interesting
guys guys don’t bully burberry he hasnt developed ankles yet🙄
Burberry might have done better if he put on some shoes that fit
those nike shoes looks so unconfotable to skate, style<skills
why he with no shirt wtf
Sunny kid super and Burberry erry in one vid, what more could you ask for
That was surprising
This Burberry dude puts more effort into picking his kicks than he ever has skating.
Burberry is so ass lmfao
Sunny did his thing 👏
.swag aint everything man
That presenter make me feel hate on my heart
Cringe like who are these clowns. Get my man corey duffel to slap these wannabes lol. Gotta be able to skate and look eccentric. Mainly the skate part.
Battle of the weird necklaces
Burberry erry looks like when you customize a character in Tony hawk American wasteland for the first time lol
Erry got some cool hair
Bro Sunnys sisters so pretty i swear
i guess this is what it looks like when you invite the people hanging out in front of the berrics to try a game of SKATE...!
I think everyone knew how this one was going to go
Damn Pinhead got clapped by that Tik Toker
oh shit it's dat Playboi Carti sidekick dude
We need More battles a week this is gonna take forever
Thought this was a fictional characters battle at first.
The game didn’t meet up to its hype
How was this a fair contest at all, pitting a mere mortal against the son of the literal God of War.
Burberry got mopped
That spikey head guy wear big shoes
Its cool to see this on YT trending in the UK...
I can smell Burberry erry from here
angel vs demon
You’ve really inspired me to keep going with my gaming channel.,!
Well……. That was easy work.
we might get murdered and framed on july 4th under the cover of fireworks and framed for what they were doing. Pray for us.
But was that really a front heel?
Горшок, мочи!
I saw a lot of people saying this matchup was unfair and that Sunny was going to get destroyed.... :') really close game, well played!
Notice sunny dosnt worry what he’s wearing and bam is there with clunky shoes he’s not use too and a spiked chain swinging around , can’t say ur disappointed in loosing if u spent more time picking an outfit and doing ur hair ? 🤣
We're really gonna bash this bracket over one game at the end of the day this is still one of the dopest concepts
how the fuck did this end up in my recommended? I don't even skate xd
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swth8jDZxxs
https://youtu.be/HRpNpKm3iug
Burberry or whatever cares more about looks than skateboarding and it shows in this clip. Why you wearing a long sleeve WITH a t on top in CA In July? Get outta here
Sunny came out swinging
1999
Is this an outtake of mid90s?
2 battles a month is not how you get people excited about something....build some momentum... release the BATTLES
Dude can’t skate cause he wearing them big ass nikes🤦🏻‍♂️😂💀
Way to hype the match superdouche. 1 star.
Nope this ain’t it blurry can’t kick flip if he choked shoes
istg every time burberry is in the air he’s just floating for like a second
burberry lost because jordans arent his main skate shoes, his main skate shoes are yeezys
These guy should start a band
I'm sorry that I doubted Sunny.
Bro if Burberry had proper Skate Shoes he would win. How can u flick in em shoes, like he wasn’t even trying to flick on that fakie flip.
Cat in the Hat reading out the rules... nice
Fuck. Imagine getting to the berrics and choking this hard.
Very nice, good match. congratulations to sunny
burberry erry would've landed every trick if he got shoes that fit him
That last trick was terrible
Might help to wear shoes you can skate in..Errrrrr y 🤔
Sunburn
TRENDING IN CANADA
Горошок жив
Got banned from Berrics insta for saying Erry was garbage, turns out... I was spot on.
горшок проиграл(
Yoo 🦋
ID for patchwork pants and polo 😍?
is this wbatb
MAAAAN WHAT THE  HELL I DIDNT SIGN  UP FOR THIS
You meant “BOYY vs Burberry”
Bruh I just realized this nigga kept the stock X tag on Lmao
that hardflip should of been a letter for sunny js, and burberry should of gotten the fakie tre it counts
2:08 "no doing tricks that slide on the ground if your opponent popped his trick"
If Carti was there Burberry woulda won
Why it look like burberry have peg legs?
I'll never understand guys so thin shirtless.
Now I think I can come and play ;))
we all are waiting for the professional skater from the san fancisco bay area
homie watched hell raiser once
It’s crazy how many people there are competing
INFLUENCERS
haha worst decision they made to be in
Well uh we know how long it takes Burberry to make his edits now 😂😂😂 homie just really ain’t all that.
Calling it right now:  Semis:  Pro: Chris Joslin Joe: Dylan Jaeb  Influencer: Vinnie Banh Icon: Shane Oneill  Finals:  Chris Joslin Shane Oneill  Winner:  My dad
Kinda Sloppy but good game
Proper hardflip at 2:45
One wrong move and that necklace gonna stab erry Fr😭💀
01:15 thats why sunny won
That Blueberry dude reminds me of Mark from Home Improvement when he went through his goth/alternative phase
That’s it burned!
I was really hoping for that trendy style of filming
All the keyboard skaters here.. just enjoy it and stop moaning 🤣
burberry never claimed to be pro or any of that shit. he just a dude who likes streetwear and skates idk why yall roasting him thats y hes in the influencer bracket
Atreus !!!! Your father would be proud
He rolled his ankle before
F
That fakie kickflip was ugly as hell by burberry and should of been a letter, the rules say if your opponent pops his trick the contender must also pop his trick and that berry dude didn't
Панки хой горшок живой
How are these guys in comps, my guy couldn’t stick a kickflip and had all sketchy lands
they have so much finesse when they skate
How do you fuck up a kickflip
Instagram skater
Nah this is sick. Stop hating. They both killed it and I'm siked for what's next.
I hate that guy he looks like a goof
☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️ CIV
If he had normal size shoes he’d be way better. It’s cool for a novelty act just not serious competition
This game was ass
watching a random miss kickflips feels bad man. self expression is great but you gotta back it up. at least jim greco did heroin and had heavy switch frontside flips. he also kicked heroin and made unique skate films. i honestly feel sad for kids that are hyped on this. it's like a parody of originality. this isn't self expression is a simulation of it
it’s gonna be 14 weeks before the round of 64 is over smh
Estilo demais pouca trick
I can just hear Kratos cheering Sunny on. "Finish him Boy"
It should be a battle from every category once a week at least so the bracket moves nicely
yo yo sunny did toe tap on the Hardflip does it count still?
when you're better at distorting reality on instagram than you are skateboarding. i feel like this is parallel to seeing kardashians without photoshop
Burberry is definitely a try hard edgelord.
It was nice of them to let that homeless guy announce the game. Hope they at least hooked him up with all their cans after so he can go buy some clothes.
I understand you’re trying really hard to look cool, BUT THATS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU SKATE IN PATENT LEATHER JORDAN 1S
You can't win without Calves 😂
You did well boi
That’s because he was skating in Jordan’s
He skating with a jordan 1 😭🤧
This shit was so wack
Really need to bring back bullying
You could see the affects of that ankle roll...
ALL THAT HAIR GELL N U COULDNT HAV STUCK THAT KICKFLIP
HOW DO U GET A LETTER ON A KICKFLIP
My bracket still good!
How tall is sunny?
I hate to judge somebody by what they wear but if mans cut his hair and cut the stockx tag off his damn shoes he’d be a lot easier to watch. 😂
who else got spoiled in Burberry Erry’s live
they rly had to pick the dude with dyslexia to read the rules lol
Hype for this one!
Lmao them IG clips don’t mean shit when you cant even land a kick flip first try
Burberry could literally only do the trendy insta tricks
Damn you guys destroying these dudes for having fun … remember they got invited to BATB 12 it ain’t their fault you wouldn’t turn it down either 😂😂 lord knows they’re better skaters than I am
Burberry looked so intense at first with those 👀
*Kid vs COVID-19*
They influence u not to skate like that😂
See you guys in 7.5 months for the final
Wheres the pop at fakie 3shuv sunny bruh?
I didn’t believe it was actually possible for bird man to be wacker than he looks🤦🏽‍♂️ Holy fucc what a 🤡 talkin all that shit!
Nigga this was not the time to have this random jabronie try to read his first paragraph 🤦🏽‍♂️ Commmon bruh
Weird to see Midler taller than other people
this really makes u appreciate the pro and am games lol
This was hard to watch..
Missed kickflip just about sums it up
When ur more worried about how u look then how u skate lol
that mc @kidsuper is just awful
Im gonna go out on a limb here and say it was the shoes.
Alex is high as fuck
God, the level 😐
Burberry could've won if he skate at NYC spots with Strobeck being a filmer
bro what happened to Sunny😂
Fun to c a heel flipper and kick flipper
No tengo ni la más mínima idea de quienes son los skaters, y patino desde hace más de 10 años jaja, estoy perdido
Lmaoooo Burberry fuckn sucks🤣
I waited a whole week for this shit tf
Interestingly, I believe this is the first time anyone in BATB went shirtless
Berra included the influencers in the BATB to expose these sweg brats
Mid 90's is pretty damn good!
i can tell the influencers and joes might not make it
Who is he influencing exactly with a performance like that?
Shit ain’t the same no more …
How TF did Atreus end up at the Berrics? Kratos is gonna be pissed, boy.
You lose when you disrespect the gold toes.
berrics come on!! at least 4 a week!!!!
Why even have refs lmao those tricks were nasty asf everything was redo
wtf even was this these dudes are trash
Sunny don’t miss
2:45 he touch the floor
Burberry a fucking weirdo lmao
This is a joke...
kid super!! so sick !!!!
Горшок ебаш
What did i tell yall haha hell yeah
Burberry was so nervous he couldn't even look at the camera at the start
🤢 no así no, muy mal skate 😪
Midler was like " I think it's uhhh you go again?' lol
Let’s keep it real we all saw this coming
Not bad.. 🍻
nothing better than a good batb match at five o'clock in the morning, peace out fellas.
lol big difference skating for IG clout than skating in real life.
Well fucking done. Great battle. Burberry's 360s were on point.
It was a solid battle. I like how they shake hands before the last trick.
That Burberry guy is one of the weirdest guys around with one of the most punchable faces you're likely to ever come across
I hate to say it fellas, but this aint it.
This shit is mad cringe bruh
i know old dudes always say this about younger gen... but seriously this gen has lost it mind, social media has screwed them up
@berrics more games... Shit like this is hard to watch
Sick battle 🔥🔥🔥
KIDSUPER THE FUCKING LEGEND
Johnny Goth vs My N....
People used to try not to look like total clowns
the only game sunny will win
Muito fraco. Alguns nomes novos que não mandam nada , ao menos em solo !.
Can anyone explain who these two dingle berries are ?
Burberry needed get some shoes that fit
By far the worst BATB. Waste of time.
i’m gonna watch the finals in a retirement home
BATB 12: COVID-19 vs. Mid90s
I think the way they're doing this BATB is having the ams and influencers go first because let's be real, some of them aren't the best like this video proved. Some are great but this is basically the video part we fast forward to get to the good stuff.
Since John Hill and that Andy dude don’t wanna compete you should let followers choose who takes their spots.. Hyun Kummer would be awesome
That Burberry guy is definitely James Euringers' son
That was no good ....
maybe he would skate better if he didn’t skate shitty jordans
Sunny need to eat a sandwich
Why would you skate with a chain like that around your neck?!?! So fucking sketchy. Imagine taking that to the jugular after falling on a kickflip……. 💀
Bs180 heel was sooooooo buttery
i guess doing trendy clips and having odd looks won’t help you win a game of skate
Burberry look like old-school Travis barker
game starts at 1:18
Glad that one is over lol
I love ya sunny<33
batb 12 finals happening 2022
Probably the coolest match up
Damn sunny lookin good tho wasn't expecting that
Yeah, I'd much rather watch real skaters rather than influencers. This was fucked
This was the least BATB I’ve seen in a BATB
burberry look like he got prosthetic legs on
No cap just put me in there next round i woulda not folded like emo sonic
Classy handshake before the loss
That anime kid!
I land all these tricks easyly , too much hype
Brooo this dude burbery can’t kickflip
Ugly stuff
these are the guys girls simp for on tiktok
Keep it original , no posers
To much hype...  🙂
damn
Here before 1 million views
This is one of the videos that makes me proud to have to nothing to so with social media (excluding YouTube of course).
The real battle was me watching this shit without cringing hard
I love this bracket, can't wait to see it all and have replay on these
Adidas 1x0 nike
Hey! Do a kickflip... Oohh ok u can't
This was a true battle of the joes
This shit was hard to watch.
This is how it goes when I play skate with my friends LOL
who the hell is burberry erry lol
Not great. This is like if I played skate heh
I wish the berrics posted a battle every day
disappointed af
I really wanted Burberry to win. But He should have just worn the Yeezys
Bruh sunny had a secret deathblow
bruh yall rlly gon upload like twice a week lmao
didn't worth waiting a whole week for this game
Highlight was KidSuper randomly being there
I was looking at the brackets and they put Jamie griffin vs Aaron kyro. Poor Aaron
I fel bad for burburry because I know he can do so much more!!!
Sunny was better than I thought.
Pee wee Herman didn't do his signature trick.
bro i guarantee 95% of the people watching this and bitching about how bad of a game it was and trashing on sunny and erry literally cant do any of these tricks, especially w any consistency and not to mention on camera w thousands of people watching etc. buncha fuckin haters. yall are really who is lame. not these AMs going on here and trying there best. now you wanna bitch about the fact that these guys arent uploading enough games. yall got a point there.
so many children crying in the comments, go make some mac n cheese
Guess people don’t know how to respect others anymore
Why complain it’s batb they always do 2 games a week doesn’t matter how many games there are and these guys did good for there first time least there in it and got invited most people complaining can’t even see a step at the front door
Transgenic kids 👶👎
Sweet
I was cringing from 0:00 - 4:41
u guys should have zach seraseno on batb13?
I hope Sunny picks it up, and goes alot further. Not sure if wearing Superstars is really a good idea tho.
Kooks
Haven't watched the vid yet, but Sunny's stunning on a board. Not sure why he's shirtless though, a fall could hurt like hell..
this shows what happens when you spend too much time buying clothes and styling your hair than actually skating 😂
The best batb game ive ever seen! Insane!
See the problem with some jordan 1s are they can be really slippery. He needed to pull out some of his sb lows
Skinniest person with a 6 pack on the planet lmao
That was as exciting as the women's finals.. sad
Hell ya mid 90s kid
Easy
Bro this looks like a game at local minus the lesbian and sid vicious wanna be wearing fucking moon boots.
Damn, before I started the video I thought to myself “this is going to be a painless death for Sunny” - definitely pleasantly surprised!! You rip bruh
Erry 🤢👎👎
esta superr
Burberry looks like a SoundCloud rapper
I'm worried about their legs from spinners 🤣🤣 either dude could get a fracture
That Was boring
Sofaygo??
Give Sunny credit, dude is an ACTOR that loves skateboarding, he never made any claims about being top level, he just loves to skate and I respect that
Y'all gonna seriously keep people waiting for a week then post this battle with a straight face?
Burberry may have lost, but everything he hit was so perfect, amazing how light he is
Kod super kigwahhahahahahahahhaha
Who the fuck is that Travis Barker clone?
I must be from a different generation but everybody over here like “Burberry this and that” Like who the fuck is this kid!? Lol not tryna hate but damn.. Too many skaters out there can’t keep track of.. Hate me or not but I guarantee y’all Nick Holt will make it to finals.. I got $100 on it and a case of PBR! 👏🏻🍻🤨
I know porquipine is tech based off of the one instagram clip I ever saw of him but he's so sloppy what kinda match up was this ?
Bro Alex midler should not be the ref in this game he looks high ass fuck sunny had did his deathblow trick and he counts it
Cheering for a switch heel
the wasnt that great
Smh. 100% sketch. Felt like playing a game with a random at the park to warm up.
TFW when that kid lands wrong on his necklace. 🔥 😈 🔥
Everyone needs to chill the fuck out on worry about the pace of the schedule. Be fucking grateful that something of this caliber is being put on. This is the greatest BATB ever … and it’s not every close
With the StockX tag on 😂😂😂 nooooo
better volley than i thought considering how it started and the handshake after sw front heel was dope
LMAO
Sunny is so smooth 🔥
I am sorry sunny that hardflip was so freaking ugly 😆
brought me joy to see my sleep paralysis demon losing to a child without a shirt on
Is that Jordan x Travis Scott
I thought sunny was a chick at first
Burberry. Camt decide weather to be fresh or proficient at his sport with properly broken in equipment..that suuuucked.
Full of 💩
Bro I can’t even Lmaoo
Are those the kids that do more than any 90s pro you always talk about Berra?
with all due respect, this was truly horrendous
no hating shit but wow these kids inconsistent….it’s wild how good you can seem on social media when in reality you’re basic at best.
Honestly thought this game was pretty sick!
why burberry there bruh
GIVE US MORE !!!!
This was boring
Everyone's a critic. The brackets are interesting but like they already said, getting everybody's schedules to line up is difficult. Be glad they're hosting BATB at all!
RIPed singer of russian music band that  known as GORSHOK playing a Game of Skate with the strange child. Shitty music extremely fits together with shitty skater
is he deadass wearing crystals around his neck?
As a big fan of both of them wtf was this
Must have been some cut+paste video editing here... I mean the people applauding. Not only did this suck, both look like some insecure teenager hipsters with confidence issues. Used to like Berrics, but shit this sucked so bad, I'm saying bye.
2:46 shoulda thrown the red flag burberry
We need at least 3 games a week!
That spiky dudes chicken legs always makes me uncomfortable
Dam, so much hate, imagine being a movie star and ripping that hard?
Hey berrics make shit faster
dude really got the stock x tag on his jordans. yea... mans is doing too much
Rip 😭😭
shit game
sooooooooo that nollie tri flip wasnt a redo ok
Battle of the soy boys. It can only get better from here...
Blueberry, your fucking shoes were so loose, thats why your flip tricks, especially Heel flips weren't poppin.
this was the gayest shit ive seen all week
Who's wearing the gayer necklace
this some bullshit; barely any editing required...just fucking post them all.
When your death blow isn't lethal enough, you do another one. Great defense, sunny!
My grandkids will be dead before the finals are posted
i know kids at the skatepark that are better than these two
game of skate shirtless with your supreme underwear visible? You deserved to lose for that alone guy
It is so disgusting that they upload 2 battles a week Will not watch it again. Thanks to Koston and Steve for that bullshit. Also that they are into Scientology sucks
LA is fucking weird man, why do they all dress like gta characters
Burberry is the prime example of someone skipping the basics for the cool tricks
More skate less swag
I remember BurBerry from Tony Hawks American Wasteland. He was a custom Preset haha
💀
I mean, damn
he should of worn his yeezys
Maybe this was a bad idea
You wanna Tell me that sunny chose his nollie tre as his Trick for the whole death blow thing when he can first try Land a switch Front heel ¿
This was a bad influence.
Figures sunny would win
Pqp, 4 min perdidos da minha vida, em saber que PJ ladd ficou de fora pra esses influenciadores vista participar… vai toma no cu
Big meh on this1
those gold toe 1s though
Wow, this is like a game of skate when the skaters don’t know how to do 98% of every trick ever done. 👌
We really skating Jordan’s nowhuh
burberry erry needs cartis support
Horrible skating on this level. The world have much talented skaters... Berrics cmon!!!!
I don't know these guys and maybe it was nerves, but this game of skate was insanely poor and low level. Pretty disappointing but at least the games should get better. 2 games a week as well, how long is this shit gunna go on for LOL..
i was not expecting that lmao
Berries has become so cringe
Hey at least it’s better than BATB 9. That Nick Holt game was amazing.
Most sketchy game of skate ever 😭
Internetfamous
was not expecting Sunny to be this good, congrats to him.
Berry is such trash😂😂😂
jordan is shitty for skating, i always find it hard to flick my toes probably
Lets goo
I'm glad Tony Hawk declined your offer to participate in BATBXII cause by the time you get to the icons he'll be 80.
Burberry !!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
oh man I feel so influenced right now.
What a shame skateboarding has become. 🤡🤡🤡
Neither of them are wearing cariuma? this can’t be right
this battle is actually so bad but nice that we see a batb in 4 days
If you went for berry you’re just dumb
Brutaaal!!
this isnt worth a battle at the berrics! back into the trash can with this insta boys....
burrberry had a rolled ankle to be fair guys...
Honestly they should've made sure that the people they called can actually hold their own in a game. I mean I've seen better battles between random folks at my local park 🤣
yo who let their mans walk out the crib dressed like that? homeboy wearing a fuckin dog collar
Burberry probably would’ve done much better if he wasn’t skating in fucking patent leather shoes, like there is no way flicking in those things is easy.
Sunny is actually nice. I didn't watch mid90s and don't follow him on socials so forgive me for not knowing.
It feels like I’m playing Tony Hawk. Congrats to Sunny!
sunny vs roy purdy would be dope. sunny would obvs take it tho
How can you tre but barely kickflip?? why is he even there??
Hey what's going on between Sunny and Alex at 1:15? Words of encouragement or..?
how is Luan Oliveira NOT considered an icon tho?
burberry's whole style and kit is fucken wack
Burberry’s Instagram clips must take a whole day to film.
Weak round 👎
Who the hell is Burberry Erry? Guy looks like the emo version of Reese from Malcolm in the Middle
Chile
This is a game I could’ve kept pace with
burberry erry skates as 'good' as he looks....
Yall cant do half of these tricks bruh skate community at it again
Damn we waited a week for this😐
Thank god there’s at least a few actual good skaters in the influencer bracket or we’d have to watch a lot of games like this.
Sunny toe dragged so dramatically on that hard flip
C'mon man, this guy rocks in the j's 1 and do this shit??
These two suck
I’m pumped for the purdy ginner battle
I believe someone said it would be 31 weeks for all games to be posted if its at this rate.  Longest batb ever. Lol
Erry slatt
It was like watching a couple of kids at the local skatepark.
Sunny idk why you flexing so hard with necklace and fckn supreme like damn dude you are literally a movie star. Grow up n be humble.  And berryboy.. same goes to you.. but also skate better. Wtf were those flip tricks. Disgusting
that is one dangerous necklace, especially to be skating in
Sunny is not very nice vibes Erry is a good skater man
A bit underwhelming tbh
Nul nul nul
Even i can do better it's a shame a game of skate like this, i would like to go back in time and didnt watch this
Burberry has a whack ass attitude, never wanted anyone to lose as much as I did him 😐
new batb sucks
Okay well that mostly certainly sucked
JUST DO FATHER ARRON KYRO ALREADY
I feel bad because he was probably nervous as shit cause he ain’t use to none of that camera shit
Cariuma presents 🙄
well that was underwhelming
Maybe Berra will stop posting his burberry boyfriend ten times a day now
I really waited a week to see this guy miss a kickflip and halfcab flip cuz nobody zoomed in on his fit
Weak
@0:17 the topless dude could not be more excited :D
worst idea ever
sunny CLEARLY toe touched on the hardflip
Good game
who tf is burberry some insta skater? lol
Poor, like a game of skate at my local that was
Upload faster now
Instagram always makes skaters look good  A good edit and song can sell anything
This sucked bad
crazy what happens when u care more about ur style and clothing than ur actual skating ability lol
Oh my God that sucked
Love the sportsmanship
you can always see the nervousness in everyone on the batb
Burberry’s kickflip position is a little off? His foot is central/middles to the deck can’t be much flip out?  And the shoe choices? Maybe a little style over anything? good set of DCs re always nice or Adidas busnitz ,everyone in blazers these days for the instagrams clips
All the green stock x tags in the world cant save that one 😂
I wonder what they identify as?
Cat in the hat is the host
This might be the worst battle ever. Let us just see the Pro’s please.
To everyone in the comment talking shit there's a reason they're in batb and not you. Good game
I am glad with the results
Bro needs actual shoe
boof af
Damn the Cat in the Hat sure did a good introduction
Whats up with the spikes
kratos : you did well boy.
Is MJ gonna be in the tournaments?
This was…😬👎🏻
The crowd is ass
This man need to get a haircut
Did they fr count sunnys hard flip tho
Sucks when your outfit can’t win for you. If this kid dressed normal no one would give a shit about him
Just to think, I was never in a BATB.  No hate, its just..........y'know...... uh...
Bruh he was too nervous
SLS is doing the team Prod vs team Malto games right now. So y'all can go watch that in between BATB.
Es la batalla con más errores que eh visto jajaja estos vatos mejor que se vayan a practicar
Bro I thought sunny was gonna get smoked
man's shoulda focused on his skating rather than his outfit hair n what shoes he was gonna wear 😂 fashion punk kook
sunny didnt pop the fakie 3 shuv dont they say in the rules that if u pop a trick the opponent has to pop as well? just curious
This just confirms burberry is an insta skater 🤷‍♂️
Easily the worst BATB to date 👎
Bruh
Where is Kader ???
What Most people don't get: pressure also plays a big Role in a Game of skate. I think this game was pretty decent
Kratos is proud. 🤣💯
I mean Sunny was going pretty strong.
looking at the bracket and Jamie Griffin vs Aaron Kyro is a joke
Those two different hardflips were both sick to see.
erry woulda won if he skated the marshmellow yezzes
this is first vid where i like 10 comments in a row
O cabelo de bacteria usa logo uma geladeira com cadarço KAKSKKAKS
Awesome battle!!
так вот куда Горшок съебал
Essa słonecznik  Next oponent aaron kayro z San franczesko bay strefa i znów essa na typa
Burpberry is fucking trash; must take him forever to get his park clips
how tf you play a game of skate and miss a kickflip first try lmaooo
Congrats Sunny!!! When is the next GOW Loki. ;)
Berra and Koston rethinking that whole "influencer" thing about right now.
*4 min battle* -ok it cant be that bad *first letter missing a kickflip* oh,it is that bad
These boys need a meal.
Glad I didn't have to see that stupid necklace again
Burberry should change his name to Rocket Man.
Ummmmm this was disappointing
Looking forward to finals night next year 😂
Dingleberry wasn't even trying. Why would you agree to participate when you're gonna just give up after you miss a kickflip?
Luisito Comunica
Finals is scheduled to be delivered in 2-3 business years
Burberry's board didn't leave the ground on the fakie flip. Neato :D
2:22 whys he so mad LMAOOO
there should be a 5th section for Kooks and Outcasts
Solo redes sociales y tomas editadas ajajaja bullshit
Good match!
burberry erry is apparently not a kickflip guy
can i just get a rough idea of when johnny giger is playing?
Man i was following spikehead coz of the style....but man!!! talking bout skate tricks they suck!they suck a lot!!!!take of I fluencer out o f the batb¹2 (or maybe not until @jonnygiger
bro his ankles are so small
Wow that game was so good!
How come dude can’t do a basic kick flip???
dude ? this burberry erry guy's instagram is all flat ground tricks im confused ? he should be hammerin shit left and right lol oh yeah... theres no bank to boost him in the air
i love the inclusion of the follow count in the description so we can gauge how influential each influencer is lol
SUUNBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURNT
Imagine if that dude just wore skateboarding shoes instead of not wearing skateboarding shoes.
😂 That was a very weak battle! I could have smoked them!
Burberry disappointed me
damn i was really hoping jimmy urine would make it further
Holy shit this is wack....influencer shit is hella not needed.
Berrics isn't what it used to be, this is basically a social media and advertising frenzy, and a cariuma shoes event. They're spacing out the games like it's a reality show, forget this channel I'm out
I thought milder and sunny were the same age lol
At least the no pop nollie tre didn't end it. Erry has some clean tricks.
man be wearing jordans for skating
This is BATB LOCAL SKATEPARK ADDITION, skate rat kid vs goth park kid
Haha Goth Boy sucks, but Sunny won’t make it much further either.
Boring
Skating some gold toes with the stock x tag still on them... So cool
Missed a kickflip wtfffffff😖
this went exactly the way i expected , the influencers bracket is a joke
All this wait for a boring game :/
The fakie 3 shuv on defense shouldn’t have counted, right? Burberry popped his on offense
lol why is everyone bitching? I enjoyed that game
Why is Sunny wearing a collar?
That was weak
I was hoping to see my dude Will Fyock in this berrics..
What is a frontside half cab heelflip? Ain’t no such thing
When you see this… you know they will never win it 😂
I used to love BATB but this is rubbish. What happened to actual pros doing good tricks?
Get these tik tok skaters outta here. Burberry 🗑🚮🗑🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮
looked like to me berry shoes were too big and he couldn’t get any pop. probably why he was doing the suv it’s. have agree everyone else, interesting concept but at this level each game isn’t that hype. def do a few at a time of these guys, sure most will be over in like 5 min, but props to them. i would be suuuper sketch knowing so many people watching
good one tho, i was expecting more of burberry but he did sick tricks too
Great opener
I’ve seen better skating at my local park lol
damn really wanted to see burberry bust out the one foot 360
At least we still getting Garrett this weekend.  Cause this battle ain't it
we need versace plug
Respect to Burberry ! Dude was real nervous and still performed a nicely 🦾so happy with this year so far thank you Berrics !
It's crazy how you can see how slippery the berrics is with the influencer side of the matches, the pros make it seem do easy
On Erik's live he said Alex was lowkey talking shit the whole time but he still loves them both, damn I was rooting for Erik but kinda knew Sunny would win
Only two battles a week? C’mon guys you know skaters aren’t that patient.
if they filmed burberry trendy he would of landed ever trick known to man
I thought Burberry was going advance for sure. Sunny came through with the W though. You could tell ole' Burbs was nervous. He landed a couple beautiful tricks though. That back heel was impeccable. Them jitters just got the better of him it seems.  🖤🛹💪🤙✌ Ig: @sk8board_john
From the thumbnail I thought this was who could look the edgiest
proof that burberry is a mannequin for a living
Berry was nervous asf !!!!!!!!! It took a toll on his skating
How do you say it? All style, no substance? Well, "style".
Kidsuper? really? 😷
so we not going to talk about what happened at 2:45
Bruh as soon bur seen sunny won Rock Paper Scissors he knew he fucked up
All of y’all hating but don’t understand how many jitters they must have being in their FIRST BATB battle. Burberry even said that the camera thing would fw him. Y’all rude for what smh
So you choked, it happens. No one in the comments ever made it that far
Kid Super is an icon man🦸
This was a mess lmao
“No bonle- boneles-“
Burberry could’ve easily won that it was the shoes that messed him up
That switch front heel was clean  🛹🔥
Sunny just chilling with no shirt like he’s a God 😂
was this fimled yesterday? i saw Eriks live after but idk
This kids chain is weighing him down too much lol
I like to imagine Burberry's hair would just pierce the ground, rather than bend when he falls
Next week: Justin Bieber vs Avril Lavigne.
Not a bad game
Burberry has nothing
Jesus the power levels were not matched at all like goku vs krillin
Burberry just screams “I hate you dad.”
I know its probably super hard to schedule 64 skaters for a video, but yall should get at least 4 battles a week
burberry is so ass, all clothes no real style, wack skater
Atreus wins
I’m just waiting for Rodriguez vs. Huston 🤯
Fuck yeah sunny
Honestly just waiting for the pros to take out everyone. Lets speed this up a bit get these no names outta here
I also wish the vids would come out quicker. I'm still going to watch them no matter what though. Plz don't torture me like that Berrics!
Burberry really came threw Looking like that dressed like that and just lost lmao
Whoda thunk Burberry Gary or wtv tf he’s called only is good at flashy or gimmicky tricks lol. Also my boy sunny goin thru an e boy episode frfr
Give em a medal
Love his style tho this is a super refreshing series
You could tell right from the beginning
berra is blowing it these days
lmao scientology battle
Well that was boring 🙃 I expected more from Burberry
Didn’t see that coming! Congrats Sunny
How tf this guy get at batb
dude finals gonna be great in 5562 🤪
These comments are ruthless lmao
These comments are wack. Yes the bracket is big, yes it will take longer. Half you guys complain it’s too fast when the normal bracket is out.  Also, this is pre filmed so they have more matches done than we know of. People on YouTube find anything to complain about lol
I think spiked hair guy was in the wrong place, he just looked confused
This was so un-climactic  Too much time on video edits not enough time on flat ground 🥴
fasterrr
Why does everything have to be the best just to be interesting? As long as it’s between to equally skilled opponents then I’m loving this shit.
jeeeez sunny is gonna put out dope footy this year
Listen both these young men have a very bright future skateboarding in front of them it's a life long journey.
sunnys backside flips 🥰
He'd land more tricks if he didnt wear such dumb shoes
No wonder Pj is not in it
Maybe he needs smaller shoes . Idk I only skate every day
this is the first time i can confidently say that i could beat someone at batb
who's the kook reading the rules?
I was hoping that erry was lying about choking in his live..smh
They were both nervous fr..
The berrics community is full of entitled kids lmao. These guys don’t owe you shit. Be thankful for the game of skate they organized :)
hyped for the jamie griffin battle
If the game is less than 5 mins you know it’s gonna be trash. I knew sunny was gonna get this one though.
burberry would’ve won but i can tell he is so nervous because isn’t used to to being up in front of everyone and cameras
mans had to much hair gel, lost to a 13 year old
battle of the clowns ?
By the time BATB is done Trump will be back in office. Pls upload a video at least every 3 days
Bro whar
Never saw someone failing a kickflip at the berics tho
thought for sure that was a chick!
Boi what the hell boi
Shits absolute trash like the berrics
holy shit this is insane. biggest batb of all time
My local is better than that
Hahaha. Enjoyed this match. Lowkey, would have loved to see the other person won. Also, Midler the reff 💀💀
Dois emo fudido
pre recorded and still we have to wait a lot for a single game c'mon berrics stop building stereotypes
he should have pulled out the back 3 one foot
I think they’re only doing 2 uploads a week cause they need to organize this shit .. or not unless they’re trying to make it as long as possible . They will defs lose the hype cause nobody wants to wait for this shit
Personal opinion if you can’t do basic tricks you shouldn’t be on BOTB
i really really REALLY thought erry would win cuz he has some weird ass tricks up his sleeve but sunny whooped his ass on the basics, great match!
WE NEED MORE BATTLES A WEEK.
That was a snooze fest
I'm just here to say I DON'T FUCKING CARE HOW LONG THIS SHIT TAKES AND Y'ALL SOUND LIKE NOOBS COMPLAINING ABOUT TWO BATTLES A WEEK. Stop it. Who cares how long it takes? Can you imagine scheduling 64 skaters to do anything? We get battles every weekend for the foreseeable future and that's fucking awesome. Edit: Like, ffs, don't y'all want to enjoy watching this shit? If you're just here to find out who wins then come back in a few months. But stop with all the complaining already. "We want more people in the BATB!!!" year after year. They give us more people in the BATB and it's "fuck this shit it's taking too long!!!" Fucking whiners.
Lmao wtf are those shoes
spike off white boring me eyes
Fewf only 15 more weeks till round 2
Probably my least favorite game. Pretty unentertaining.
wtf happened to the berrics
Its like watching 2 american wasteland characters playing skate
sunny's hardflip must have been the weirdest looking hardflip i've ever seen
No bonelessness
Watched for free and still I want a refund
Yes
vincent nava would’ve won smh 🤡
burberry erry would’ve landed every trick if he had tied his shoes
too bad burberry’s ankle got mosh while practicing for this, they both did good tho both had tricks each couldnt do
someome tell that dude hed of landed more tricks if he used real skate shoes lmao
BATB 1 have seen higher level
spikey hair dude tries too hard.
Burberry choked
all everyone do is be negative 😐
Sunny should have had to pop the fakie 3 shuv. It’s in the rules
That last trick was sick!
Style's really taken a dive these days.
Fuck i hated everything about this
Battle of the Soundcloud rapper's
Wow Sunny's backside flip was way way waaaay to steezed for his age
Not a fan of the meth look lol
My boy sunny
Worst game in berrics history
Burberry has no swag
At what rate are these dropping? It’s taking forever to progress. Longggggg time
I did not just wait a whole week for that
Better to come. Don’t worry.
How did these guys make it to batb?
Sunny made me an extra 20 dollars
Burberry Erry lookin fried as hell 😂 homie skates like he doesn’t want to scuff his shoes
Burberry Erry is such a shitter and so cringy on IG I’m glad he lost lol
all he had to do was wear actual skating shoes
When you skate as bad as you look 🤷🏾‍♀️
seen better games of skate at my local :/
1:15 sunny squaring up to midler on the right lmao
That was a bit bullshit, dudes not even putting effort into it
For the first few seconds I was confused why this pretty lady didn't rock a bra lmao
The only saving grace was that the kid super guy was there
Lol boooo
Is this a 90s costume party?
esse árbitro tava nas pedra deixando aquele hardflip e o nollie 360 flip passarem
maybe the ankle injuring hurting the flick on burberry's kickflip, his tres were nice which is mostly back foot so
Are you not influenced?!?
In 30 weeks we will finish all the battles if the berrics keep uploading at this rate
literally everybody in this video looked like dont wanted to be there
Smoked that foo
2:20 wtf
Just watching Burberry skate with those basketball shoes made me uncomfortable, Perhaps he should used some bowling shoes next time
Damn when I first saw sunny in the movie trailers for mid-nineties I thought he was a poser skater they just pulled off the street. Talk about judging a book by it's cover he was actually pretty good
They need two match every day.
wtf was this
imagine if carti was there
Why is he wearing gold toe 1s smh
I expected a lot more from the batb this year.
*Two stick bugs play skate 2021 colorized
Kid super :D
Shit game man , wtf was that ??
Really makes you realise the difference between those insta clips you see and a real pro skater
that’s lowk sus that midler was the ref 🧐
pls post faster this is taking too long :(
what the fuck was that hardflip lmaooo
A lot of people know Burberry for crazy tricks but it’s just him hanging out having fun he’s not consistent on some of these and then the crowd and filming got him but it was a good game I knew the outcome sunnys flat ground is good don’t sleep on him because he’s a kid lol the kids are running the pros down now it’s so weird
Remember when it was people relevant for skating and not social media. That was dope.
He should’ve wear Yeezys instead of Jordans that’s why he didn’t win
Bro that first kickflip is evrything
Wait... Half cabs can be frontside? 3:12
This blueberry dude literally floats over his board
This batb is going to take a whole year to get to the finals💀
3:08 Burberrys Nollie 3 how tf did that count??? Should of been a re do lol
well that was fast
Why is the always some kook ass foo reading the rules?
Ну такое, скучная игра. Я думал что burberry.erry покажет что то нормальное
Skateboarding millennial edition
Questionable 🤨
Sunny has great style. His flick is on point tho
Sunny styled like a lesbian
I’m washed up and in my 30s and I would have won that game
This is the Moment where im at the Point of my life asking myself the first time why im not at batb
Half the comments are about how this battle sucked. The other half are about how they're posting these battles way too slow and at this rate BATB12's going to finish in 2023.
why wear 1's
who tf is this clown trynna look like a punk
Who the fook is burberry?
The Berry got spread
Wack battle
Get easy on those dudes right here. All fun and games until you feel the pressure of the whole fucking world watch you play skate, and you’re just a dude with a bunch of followers, not even pro, not even an AM. These dudes are skaters, stop fucking hating on your fellow people
Правила читает Мега мозг
And Ellis Frost didn’t get a invite? No disrespect to these two but Ellis is way better.
Burberry the type to film for a week for a IG edit
Some folks in the comment section don't understand how hard it is to schedule 64 people in an international competition during an olympic year where skateboarding is making a debut and some travel restrictions are still in place globally. AKA CHILL THE FUCK OUT and enjoy the competition as it unfolds.
Damn. Sunny's hardflip was old-school as hell. Looks like he wasn't in Mid-90s for nothin.
Burberry looks like Dr Evils son...Scotty dont
He cant kickflip?! LOL
I died laughing when I saw that the whole bracket this shit is going to go on forever😂
Cool!!
Probably better not to watch any battles at this time. Wait til early 2022 & just binge watch. Finals aren't gonna be til next summer anyways.
This is actually just a game at my local
This literally was a game me and my homies would do ugly asf and sloppy 🤣🤣 smh 🤦🏾‍♂️
hell yea Sunny!!
Lmao
These comments 😞😂
Pra que chama um candango desse pro BATB ?
This is how the berrics works. They know they have all eyes on them right now because BATB. So they gonna post 10 videos inbetween every single match lol. They really be doin the absolute most these days
shame
This was so disappointing 😭
Can’t wait to watch the finals in a nursing home when I’m old and senile!
these guys both look like tony hawk underground 2 create a skaters. I would know, because I think I've created both of these skaters, haha.
Why homie still got the StockX Tag all on the J’s 😵‍💫
i think the reason for having 2 battles per week is that not all the participants are readily available to skate. tokyo olympics is just around the corner so that F up the scheduling for this. i'm good with just 2 battles schedule but i hope they pick up the pace once the skateboarding event in the olympics is over.
I'd rather watch 2 squirrels fight over a nut
Trash
He lost because his feet leave his shoes everytime he pops lol my guy has sticks for ankles and puts on shoes 4 times his size. Looks like my two year old trying on my shoes.
That Burberry kid got exposed lol his flat game is weak and his following is pure from his outrageous outfits smh
Well I guess it's a good each skater gets more practice considering how long this is gonna take.
Mais tempo arrumando o cabelo que andando de skate
пезда
John hill and Andy shrock 😂😂😂😂😂
Burberry can’t kick flip but he could hardflip
Let’s hurry up these whatever games to get to the good shit
God of war kid
LOL @ Midler giving Sunny a pre-game pep-talk at a very intimate range. Far right side of the screen at 1:15.
Letters on tricks my rusty ass can get on lock with a month of skating flat, really worth waiting a week for...
I have seen better games of skate in front of my house
Can someone just do a nollie front flip
I feel like it would’ve gone better for him if he actually wore skate shoes , good game though
Boy, that sure sucked.
Anybody do the math of when the finals is gonna be?
I'm Sorry, but why does those influencers always look so damn extroverted?
is a dead crowd the new thing? wtf was that?
Kegeden sepatu
For some reason skaters think satanism and pentagrams is extremely “edgy”
erik shoulda did switch front 3 back 3 one foot and nollie half cab heel
Had to watch Torey Pudwill vs Luan Oliveira after this to remember how the berrics is shit now
This was hard to watch
4 mins? Someone got wrecked
🇧🇷🤘
I think the trendy kids need a game of "sk8" keep it short and sweet.
Burberry needs to put more effort into skating and less into his look.
Ah no maaa no se que me impresiona más si ver el batb 12 o que luisito comunica lea las reglas jaja
4 vids a weekend bru🤦‍♂️
So fucking shitttt
These comments are lame!! Way to go Sunny!! You kept great composure under pressure!! 🤘
W
These guys are not pros or AMs...they were asked to be in this..who would turn it down ! I appreciate them participating and making this bracket possible..keep perspective
Literally Who vs Literally Who
hell yea, tri star
these 2 are not contenders, get these guys outta here
damn maybe if the dude wasn't trying to skate in boots he woulda done better
Those shoes look so big on both of them. Lol
Damn Sunny was like "oh you can't Kickflip?"   Respect to both though. They're both better than me so 🤷🏽‍♂️
Exhilarating
If this was a ledge game this would have been more entertaining
The first game ever in batb that I could’ve entered. Smh….
Bruh they’re milking the sht out of BATB12.. I’ll see you guys in the finals in 2024 fudge
1:21 what was that
UPLOAD BATTLES FASTER.UPLOAD BATTLES FASTER
i know y’all saying this weak but can y’all do  half them tricks?
Sunny looking like a washboard
Stoked Sunny won!! What's up with these random dudes at the berrics? Drop the corporate garbage we're not trynna see kid super or whatever
Bussupbussup
When they miss the first kickflip. 🤦🏻‍♂️
I’m sorry but this game is wack homie straight touched his hole foot to the ground hardflip defense my ass
Twinning 📊☺️
BOY!!
seen better game of skate the year with da women , weak influencers
Tf is this shit?! Those emo kids are making me depressed watching them.. I demand another upload to compensate this trash!
I just realized we're gonna spend half a year watching like 2 minute clips here & there of guys playing something mediocre as a game of SKATE...
Those fancy shoes didn't help one bit, lol
I literally wanted Sunny to win with all my soul
I gotta tell you, i knew the boy would win! Not gonna lie though, i see better games of skate at my local
These guys have cool names.
Mr. Bells and whistles got owned
2 freaks
burberryyy MY YOUNG SHLATT SLIME! 🔥🥵 DRIPPY KING!! 🥶😈😈 LIGHTWORK!!! GO BUrberry GO!
Cant wait to see the finals next year...
Battle at the cariuma
Well done
I do enjoy the sportsmanship at BATB. No one's ever a sore loser. It's all love and respect
Just wait till Ribs Man shows up.
Shame they couldn't both lose
Yeah but that jordans tho
Wow this was incredibly disappointing
Well, that's on the internet forever...
Make it a battle a day please 😐🤷‍♂️
They must be doing them on weekends so that at this rate, covid will be long gone by finals night.
Doesn’t matter how good you are when the cameras turn on your nerves will be your downfall
That sucked and could tell both guys were off and not feeling this contest at all and hard to skate in that type of pressure when your not use to it.
i swear i sketched out this Burberry character when i was 7 in my sketchbook somewhere
erry looked mad nervous
The crowd knew this game was gonna be bunk lol
mid 90s style
it’s crazy how most of y’all acted like y’all wasn’t subbed to illegal civ smh lol
Needa go use mouthwash after watching that, wow
Let’s go Sunny🔥👍🏼☀️
This kid is confused. He dresses like a punk kid from the 80s but calls himself “Burberry,” wears patent leather Jordans, and listens to mumble rap
The kick flip gitters is a real thing
same people hating are the same people who wouldnt be stoked seeing someone drop in for the first time.
Less atitude, fashion, tiktok and more real skaters please 🙄
Burberry shoes looked like they have such little board feel
Burberry was on live last night complaining about how he didn’t want everybody to think he was a bad skater. Because he choked a lot. I’m not a big fan of Burberry just because I think he skates for the wrong reason. And I know he has a fan base but you should skate because you wanna skate. Who gives a fuck that you choked on a kickflip. Not everyone can do those. I’ve been skating for 8 years and I still fuck those up. All I’m saying is that I knew sunny had this in the bag and I think burberry skates for the wrong reason. I know non y’all care but I thought I would just throw my opinion out there.
At this pace, the finals will be held during a different pandemic tbh.
Trend skater literallt doesn’t even have any variation of normal kickflip sunny could’ve got him to tee with Nollie sw reg and fakie flip he barely landed the fakie flip lol
Has the Berrics responded to any of the comments and questions about the length if this thing?  On any platform?
vibes were so off in this one, wish it would have been a closer match.
Sunny just screams I want to be popular lol put a shirt on bro you look like an 8 year Old
2:21 LMAO!
Well, it can only get better from here
that was extremely underwhelming
If these fools don’t start posting these more often, we boycott
bro a size 9 wearing size 12 jordans
Have you guys saw the last battle?   Chris Pierre tried to sabotage / cheat against Nick Holt by tapping his board before / same time Holt pops his trick, to mess him up.
See y'all in the finals on Christmas
Bored
I thought sunny was gonna lose. Damm
I wanted to see Burberry win, just to see what shoes he’d skate next
They are both trash. Smh. Shame these guys got to go to batb and not someone who deserved it.
If erry had on other shoes he probably would of won
nice tricks go sunny
ok so round1 is 32 battles total (64skaters /2=32) we get 2 battles a week so it will take 16 weeks total to finish round 1 which means at this rate round 1 of the bracket will  not be compleated until October (3 months)
What a weird battle
Yooooo, but who heard the laugh.....omg
This is how you know who really skates and who skates for IG posts. Sunny held it down for the streets!
This was embarrassing to watch
Is it just me or Burberry’s shoes look huge lol
awesome i hate that guy 👍
Is milder wearing Jordan’s ?lol sick ass foo
I’m glad that clown is out on the first round
YAYYYY!!! Go Burberry!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Turns out patent leather Jordan 1s aren't good to skate lol
They should have put bryan arnet in this. These skater were wack. I get that this specifically is not their thing, but they should have got other youtubers who would do better at this.
after the death blow video u could just tell erry was hella nervous still a good match thi
Tbh pretty weak
what is this
So sick skating In shoes way to big for me cuz they look cool and cost money duuuuuude cuz I’m stylishly siccccckkkkkkkkkkkkk I skate in LV
Busted
Горшок жив, да ещё и на скейте катает. А вы говорите умер...
why willy wonka was reading the rules?
can we all agree that sunny is a good skater and all, but his style is so fuckin ass
shoutout sunny ! he killed this!
KID SUPER FOR THE WIIIIIIIIIIN
The guy reading the rules corny asf
The Berrics need the views, they are bankrupt!  that is the reason you will see This every weekend
ugly game
Wtf was this shit
Imagine if my man Burberry would just wear shoes that fit and are more conducive to skating…
Indie vs rockeiro
Wasn't everyone calling it for Burberry? Too much style not enough substance.
Decent battle, just don’t upload them once a year.
2:47 REEEDOOOO
I really like BATB but the kook factor here is getting out of hand.
BATB is sick but I bet the community would be hyped on seeing a Flatbar Battle at The Berrics. Hopefully next year
2:47  Look that fvckįng foot. Doesnt count That shįT
This blue jeans guy at the beginning has no fun bro 🤦‍♂️
2:46 no toes on the ground...ok
This may be the worst game of skate I have ever seen in my life
holy shit its kidsuper
How does dude sleep 💤?? He spend more time on his hair then his skating
he looks like the guy in the everlong music video a little
Dam they influenced me soo much 🙄
Worst batb battle ive ever seen so sloppy lmao
This game was the definition on nerves. Good job boys
Sunny looking like Frodo baggins
Yall see this starving teen and didn't offer him a fucking sandwich?
I don't know why don't use the mother fker flag challenge in the final trick,  you don't see than is a 3rd chance!!!!
I’m in the small percentage of people who actually enjoyed this battle, dudes obviously aren’t pro’s but can still skate better than 90% of you fatties who can’t Ollie a 2 step on your best day
Mudvayne bassist vs the kid from stranger thingys, with the cat in the hat as referee?
I know Burberry could skate, but, shit, focus on skating instead of your jumbled “style”. Way to go Sunny
maybe he would have gotten the kickflip if his fancy necklace wasn't so heavy ...
Dude with no shirt sitting in the back is to cool for school
We love you Burberry <3
World’s most boring game of SKATE
their two names together make my last name
that was a pretty good game idk what everyone is talking about
Burberry is so cringe
I'm thinking they're starting out slow because some skaters like Nyjah are going to the Olympics and have to work around the schedule of other skaters since they invited pretty much every skater.
Estava esperando por mais
First game of Skate I've seen where I wanted both sides to lose
Can't wait for Mike Vallely..and the rule's 🤔
LETS GOOOOOOOO
ахуеть
It’s influencers, this is what I’d expect from them🤙🏼😅
sunny look like a vampire
playboi carti vamp fan vs actor
Sunnys Death blow didn’t work😢🤣
As nice as it would be to have many episodes a week. That would mean they would have to gather everyone to participate multiple times a week as well. And that's asking a lot from everyone
This gotta be one of the worst battles I’ve ever seen
Dayum looks like a emo kid Halloween costume
Idk why but erry skating in the kicks really bothering me
miernoty kurwa wpadac na rymanow łaki
Sunny looking solid out there 💪
Wow, this match was far below my expectation..
Idk what the people in the comments were expecting for this battle. Like wtf why are everyone so upset.
Y’all saying this shit sucks as if sunny doesn’t have pretty decent flat game
Sick bro
erry looks like this was his first time on a board
that switch front heel though
😯😯😯😯
Signing your soul over , ain't all it's cracked up to being.....
Bro why does sunny look like FaZe Ewok 💀
Wow sunny did a hard flip the HARD way
GO SUNNY GO
Nerves really got to them fr, but it is what it is.
Bruh wtf is Burberry doin?? I guess he really can’t skate.
keith lemon reading the rules, cool
Skating like this not going to get you far in the competition. I seen better battles.
The great battle between zero pop and good board control vs great pop and no board control whatsoever
This goes to show how fake influencers are. Based on clips online I woulda thought Burberry was almost a pro skater. seeing him in this (and sunny for that matter) you realize the power of editing; cuz they both blow.
this was so weak
Berrics, I love you to death but you gotta speed this shit up
Working at hot topic dont make you a skater...
wow so many haters in the comments people are busy you know especially when your famous, all those haters probably havent working more then 20 hours in a week lol
Y’all needa post games daily
i mean, they're pretty okay though,still a better skater than me myself,but not actually for the batb standard.sunny have cleaner tricks and style than that d1ck burppberry.but then again,its battle of influencer,whatever the fuk that means
Why these guys are skating at batb 12 and alexander rademaker or ellis frost are not?
Willy wonka reading the rules
Um dos games mais ridículos que já vi, esse maluco punk é uma vergonha!
That was terrible and jesus christ why the fuck is your man dressed like that, haven't seen goths like that in over 20 years, fucking hell, and the fucking hair
Lol ... thats why the berrics did levels to this ( joes,pros, super pros,iconic pros) , these guys  are definitely joes!
Oi sunny cepet amat lu gede ,makan apaan lu
When you spend your free VC on appearance instead of attributes
Fuck you for that whistle to my eardrum ref.
Horrible this burberry 😂
Erry lookin like a thps 4 created character
You know it’s over when your opponent shakes your hand before you even beat them
Better then me still lol
Before I watch I think sunny is gonna win but who nose
Let’s go!!!
Well that was lame.
Ngl i feel I can beat Burberry in a game of skate lol
Punk
Really ??!
When Burberry landed primo and still landed the trick was insane🤯🤯🤯
Kid needs to tie his shoes.  Reminds me of my buddy in middle school who wore loose Osiris D3s and would roll his ankle every other week.   Someone mentioned the spiky hair kid rolled his in practice.  Well, no shit.
LETS GO
What. In. The. Actual. Fuck.  How did Burberry even qualify for this? Sorry BATB but this is baaaaad
That was so dissapointing
burberry would've landed everything if they zoomed in on his hair before every trick
We will see the end of another presidential administration before we see the finals at this pace
Did Spencer Nuzzi join the batb 12?
XD WTF??? Thins battle sucks!!!
To the kids crying in the comments. 1. The games are free to watch  2. More than 2 games a week will fuck up the skaters schedules and many of them will dropout  Quit your bitching and go play some roblox
When influenceres
I’m gonna be dead by the time the finals get uploaded
ESSA FOI A BATALHA MAIS FEIA QUE EU JA VI. NÃO SEI O QUE FOI PIOR... O JUIZ VALIDANDO O FAKE FS FLIP DO MALUCO OU O DOIDO REPETINDO O FAKE 360 FLIP QUE JA TINHA SIDO EXECUTADO.
lol
I’m already losing interest for something I was gassed about due to how long each battle takes to come out! Cmon berrics sort it out
This is what I'm waiting for, greetings from Indonesia
Couple of people much too cool to say they're pumped at the start Lol!
Should have done the 1 foot 360!
Горшок чет не затащил в этот раз
Dont know any of these dudes but i didnt want sunny to win thats for sure
Burberry needs a hype man
“ Burberry “ is so ugly he makes me feel sick
No dirty tricks. That was a clean game!
These kids are going to get eaten alive once the brackets start to mix
i did the maths. at this pace the finals will actually be in february 2022. no joke
Why tf are y’all releasing episodes so slowly there’s like 4 brackets it’s gonna take forever 💀
actually liked seeing a game of skate that looked like it was played by human beings. lets go for the next one.
At this rate BATB 13 will have started before BATB 12 has ended
Those nikes look silly af
So many haters eh it's dirt, sad kids. Well done guys, it's definitely harder playing in batb, way more nerves. I know for sure I'd mess up basics just due to nerves lol
I'm not complaining it was a game of skate. Not luan vs joslin or nothing but y'all needa stop whining so much.
BOI
Bunch a clowns , dam , hope y’all killin it
thought burberry was way better 😭
Kebanyakan gaya
Burberry wearing shoes that are 3 sizes too big, what did we expect
Dam BATB is just not the same anymore smh
this was fucking sad to watch
Me daria vergüenza perder así  jaja
Erik was more concerned why no one else in the building kept their tags on their shoes 😂
They need to try and get pj Ladd in this let's all comment on every video about getting pj tell they make it happen
you could've at least invited people that actually enjoys this and cheers em both up.. look at that crowd...
One of the sickest switch fs 180 heels I've seen - looked straight out of the 90s in the best possible way
No zoom in zoom out ？？
Do I warm up or go to the supermarket to buy hair gel......aaand the loser is...
This game was a bit disappointing tbh
Spikes is a stinker
Витя Цой против Горшка🤣🤣🤣
I wonder if that's a Bulgarian flag hat or just random.
Post a battle everyday, because I'm not waiting a full week to watch Instagram skaters miss kickflips.
That was the most cringiest and edgiest thing I've seen in a while. Horrible.
I almost didn't see Sunny. He looks pastel white. Someone give him some food he about to collapse. Jesus.
Burberry is still goated
I can’t blame burb for not providing his best this time. i’m uncomfortable with the unhyped spectators, announcer who obviously hasn’t been prepared plus they kept in the part telling him verbatim what   to say. also why is his collar half popped? this post just kinda clowny, lil disappointed :/
What a weak game of skate.
Слит клоун 🤡
Can they both be out
God that spikey necklace makes me so nervous... I get pegged in the eye if one of my earbuds is dangling, can you imagine catching that spike while you're popping a Tre? Oooh that'd smart
Influencers boutta get clapped.
Sunny def surprised me with the skating, it didnt feel like Bur was trying tbh
Erry skate his Dunks with StockX tag :D
KKKKKKKKK PQP até eu ganhava
58 left...haha nice
Damn man we waited all week for 4 minutes? They should do Friday Saturday Sunday.
pressure hitting hard
When is the battle from jonny giger?
This literally like watching two slightly above average skaters play skate
burberry wack
man I feel bad for Burberry's ankle, I can only imagine how much confidence that killed.
Hell yea sunny
Congrats sunny
Starting to think these instagram edits are doing a lot of carrying
lame no cap waited 4 days
Blueberry is a joke..
I know schedules are hard and the two uploads a weekend are normal for BATB but this might take so long I'm gonna lose interest
this really was not up to par.
battle "of" the berrics!
Burberrys Jordan’s are one size too big
The guy didn’t even know how to kickflip 😒
Worst BTB I ever seen. You have the transgirl vs the fake punker both cant backside flip why and how did they get on here. Better kids at Pedlow skatepark then on this episode. Skateboarding is supposed to have style, these 2 kids dont have it and never will
lol fck blueberry!
Nerves man you could tell with both of them good game.
609
What do y’all expect they ain’t pros landing every trick
This looks more like battle of the bands
This was trash
Burberry is a joke? Put zero effort into any trick.
Sunny ain't fuckin around, no gimmick shit there. Let's go💪
More time learning to kickflip, less time styling your hair.
Needed a better ref, most of those sketchy lands should've been redo's. Also Burberry said he's not really used to this kind of pressure, he usually skates for fun and not used to a bunch of people watching him. He was very nervous when they were reading the rules
Kingdom Heart characters  playing skate 😆
burberry jordan 1s look fat af lol
What ta hell was dat? I mean Berra didn’t invite Pj but these guys,what kind af crap is dat...
That was the worst fakie kickflip I've ever seen in my life
Upload 4 battles a week, we arent waiting a whole week to see games like this.
This was depressing
Bro give that guy a t-shirt
Holy shit you guys are toxic. Be happy you get a game at all.
Y’all some haters. I was genuinely impressed the kid from Mid 90’s was this good. Happy to see that he’ll keep getting better
Let's gather some money to buy Burberry a couple of McDonald's meals. Dude looks like he's only eaten a salad in the past 2 weeks and his legs are about to snap.
I hate how fashionable skateboarding has become
Literally lost in part because of his shoes lmao style over performance so sick...
Why is there not a woman's batb yet..? Only makes sense..🔥💪🏽👊🏽
Idk why people are hating so hard, like they could’ve just not done batb ever again if they wanted to. It’s only the first round and people are complaining that the skill level is too low. They already explained that it’ll be hard to schedule appropriately with such huge brackets of skaters that travel all over the world for a living. Just watch it and go on with your life y’all are making it sound like the berrics owe you something jeez.
Hey that’s the guy that pretends to know how to play guitar
Should probably stop the death blow videos when a simple kickflip set the tone at the start...
The whole "INFLUENCER"  thing is lame as fuck!!!
if these are the battles going on, show us more on a weekend... not just 1
What’s the rule if your StockX tag drags on the ground?
Fu ck , i waited the whole week for this?? WTF!!!
They look like femboys   fire skating tho
Bruh... This is awful
burberry not trying to fuck up his shoes with the kickflips
Batb used to be the top of the foodchain flatground skaters having at it and idk what they were going for this year but it sure ain't what it used to be.
burberry was fucking up a lot but his tres are so satisfying
my man still has the stockx tag on his jordans lmao
Holy shit why are there so many haters? Battle at the berrics is true entertainment and these dudes are all nervous and you flame them because you are not happy with the tricks? What is wrong with you guys - not every fucking battle needs to be on switch tre revert level, just enjoy the dudes who are having fun and stfu
Amateur hour
That was just shit from the beginning to end
Gotta agree with everyone the game did suck no doubt about it but hence why they are in the influential bracket
Yay
Ok
Sunburn!!
Who else could land all those tricks, and probably cleaner👇
gg
U know why erry lost? Bcs yall didnt zoom in zoom out
AT THIS RAATE THE FINALS WILL BE IN 2022
There's finally a game I can relate to haha
that was so anti climactic.
they should have been in a womens bracket...that was so hard to watch
What is Burberrys real name? He should be on a regular team instead of an Instagram skater. He has a really good skate style
Sunny with that “I’m young I got money and I  get to skate a lot” steez 😂😂😂 if you know what I mean that’s some real shit. Like I explain to every new kid at a skatepark. Skate as much as you can and just make sure you have fun and you’ll become the best skater ever. Just try and skate everyday no matter what.
I can do these tricks with a sprained ankle and a torn acl lol
1:13 on right corner you wanna beef withme
It was a decent game, better than the women's battles at least
These guys styles are awful
SUNNY JUST PUT THE FUCK ONNN DAMNNN SON
Dammm🥱😴
Let me put on my makeup before the game common
Next BATB should have a comment section bracket who’s wit it?
I love Burberry but that shit was ass frfr also we need 4 battles a week cuz at this rate gta 6 finna be  released before batb finals
Do BATB is more skate battle or a skate runway catwalk SS21 ?
Why are all missing the kick flip
sunnys hardflip doe
1:15 I AINT WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO TALK
Sunny didn’t even dab him up after he won.
Battle on icon and pro will be lit than the other bracket
This is why, I'm alive
weirdos
Everyone's hating how slow the roll out of the games are while everyone is practicing for the Olympics. Chill yall
The shoes prolly messed him up a bit
this guys are terrible, not to be dick but.........
I love how after Sunny’s hard flip the camera panned to Sewa because he is like the master of hardflips! Also I think Burberry was a little nervous in this game which was why he was missing some basic tricks. And to all the whiners: Please stop complaining about the pace of these games and try being a little more appreciative that it’s actually happening!
ah mano para, até eu ia mais longe nesse game
Sunny suljic vs some random skater they find at the park next pls
Suljic s legendary
Please took influencers that can skate next time ...
am i the only one on burberry's side?
Bro this game sucked ass like their is at least 3 ppl per skate park depending on the one that can destroy both of them but the Fakie Heel at the start by Erry was lOwk clean
damn that tail on the fakie flip never left the ground
Аааааааааааа
Theres so much wtf goin on with these 2 idek where to start
They both look like they’re shoes are two sizes too big
i could imagine the pressure no worries but shit the berrics gives us more then 2 a week till it starts wearing down to the end. props to both skaters !!!
Gg sunny got bangers
Tricks + Outfits + Camera Quality = this must be a throwback from they 90s hahaha
The kickflip jitters are definitely a true issue
Que anda el Luisito Comunica
This hopefully influenced kids to stop watching loser social media fucks with lame edits and actually go skate and be better then whatever the fuck this was…..
Excuse me mr berrics can you make more skate videos
Yall should post 4 battles a week because of games like this
Look what they did to my boy (boy=batb)
Atleast sunny won🤷🏽‍♂️🤣
This was so scuffed lol, i could go to my local skatepark and see better shit
Oversized cloths OK, but oversized shoes?! They look like both of them have at least 5 sizes over their usual haha
Sunny grew up quick. Mid90s was like 2 years ago right?
God damn this sucked
damn just came back after like 3 years. this shit waaaaaaaaack they got the kid from toy story all grown up lol. BURBERRY ERRYYYY
This battle makes me wanna sleep
Man they were letting Sunny toe touch and fuck up all over the place🚽  didn't even pop his flaccid 360 shov.🛑
Damn they turned off comments on their IG post 💀💀💀
Don't like the idea of them being interviewed first with their best trick.
Lol @ people who think these guys are supposed to be pro level. Just have fun watching them skate. We do need more uploads though
I actually really enjoyed this match contrary to most people in the comment section. This isn't a game at the highest level like the finals will be but these guys are still really talented and fun to watch.
Shoutout kidsuper
3:11 FS halfcab kickflip? What?! 😂 Halfcab by definition just means Fakie BS. You can't have a FS Fakie backside kickflip 😂. Also weak game.
Burberry only he’s tres and back heels
Not gonna lie, local shop flow kids at my park would’ve had a better game.. Instagram edits just make you seem better than you are I guess
bro skated to weardest shoes ever and forgot how to skate with normal shoes
Burberry needs to tighten them laces on his ankles
'influencers'....
64 skaters, 32 battles in the first round... If you actually do the math and they, let's say, upload 2 a week on the weekends, it'll take until somewhere around the beginning of 2022 to finish this.
que game horrivel
ooooof
At this point it seems like the hype is just Instagram edits from a decent filmer making shit look good
Sunny smashed
That was bad. We want more games per week.
Imagine waiting a week for this crap Im confident that ginner and purdy will put up something better tho
Yoo these guys are human beings with feelings.. stop with all the negativity. How would you feel if all of these comments were about you? Being nice doesn't cost anything!
do we really have to go over the rules in the videos every time
this game was wack
Anybody else think burberrys shoes were just gonna fly off at any second?
hard to watch :D
Burberry definitely let his nerves get to him. Kid has it
The battle for the king of hot topic was trash to say the least. Wasted my life watching this
Goofiest shit I’ve ever seen
I was disappointed
Sunny is legit, having him in the influencer bracket with this guy is so weird lmao
tf...i havent skated in like 8 years, glad to see diversity outweighs skill these days. everyones so special and important im glad they had fun
when burberry missed that kickflip all my hope was gone
Game ruim da misera kkkk....
Emerica: this is skateboarding  Emerica and more watching: this is not skateboarding……
God that was awful
I thought this battle was fun to watch; competitive battle, similar skill levels
this really makes you appreciate the pros.
i just wanted to see if sunny could do burberrys back 3 one foot
skating with somthing like that on your neck is just stupid prolly why he lost kept getting smacked by it Fail
Mcflurry sucks
Burberry not used to performing with these camera angles
Alex Midler with the fuckboy outfit🤣
Hell yeah let’s goooo
For those of you complaining about the quality of the match: you probably weren't around for the eS games of skate, BATB1, or WBATB.
Maybe if blueberry was wearing some actually fucking skate shoes he would land his fucking tricks
No Mahltoe manual shit
Just goes to show how good pros really are- like this cats aren’t even bad but just look at the consistency between pros and these guys. The difference is crazy
Yikes. Why are these two wearing shoes that look 3 sizes too big for them?
Não chamaram o Guilherme Abe por isso?!
Very weak game
What’s the point of having x2 participants and not x2 battles per weekend? Finals will be in January 2022? : (
👎🏻
Ya’ll need to upload more games daily!
that burberry dude can barely even land a kickflip lmao
Influencers? We're I come from these people would be called grommets
😂😂😂
que coisa pavorosa acabei de ver
this sucks.
It seems like if you have an interest in the latter stages of the game these influencer battles are largely irrelevant
Jesus this shit was the worst game of skate I’ve ever seen
This was ass lol
that fs heel is cleaner than soap
Why the crowd not showin love😂
Paso mí primo el inválido y dijo que les ganaba
Dude could prolly skate beter if he wasn't wearing Jordan's
Maybe it's like the Loki series, a terrible episode then they blow you away with the next one. Once a week.
Yang ditunggu tunggu
Hell yeah! Let's go sunny!
Noice
At least it was better then wbatb
This blueberry boy look so bad
Why are the contenders wearing mascara?
I wasn’t expecting much out of a 4 min battle, but damn 😂
Oof
Batb 12 is siiiiiiick
I was hoping they would both loose.
I really wanted my boy Burberryerry to win. You guys need to hurry up with these games tho
just goes to show, dressing stupid doesn't help. just focus on the skating kids.
doubled the bracket, gotta double the upload speed
I guess you could tell this battle was gonna be wack by the death blow tricks.
0:17 is that kill9gomez and kidbronze?
I really trust on Burberry :(
That was the worst one I’ve seen ever so far
Finally a battle.
I mean they could have respected us and at least released this wack ass battle early and not make us wait a fucking WEEK for it. Im sure they didnt film it this weekend.
blueberry lost
these aren’t that fun to watch anymore
Is the lil girl gonna wear a shirt next time
i've waited for this
lesgo atreus
Whose gunna set up the go fund me for aarons funeral
batb 12 finals on 2023 don't miss it guys
Erry got steeze
Worst game ever
This is one of the first battles ever I think I would’ve won lol
Now that’s what you need to know about Instagram dressed up skaters, they’re maybe look colorful but can’t skate 🤷‍♀️
Damn, no one got skunked. But I feel like it could’ve been better lol
My expectations are so low now
burberry could only land the standard "wet" tricks.. tre flip fakie tre flip 360 shuv, etc. dude is all ego-driven
it was like watching the kids that have been skating for 2 months in my local skatepark playing a game of skate.But they are both no pro skaters so im just going to thank the berrics for atlest uploading a batb video
i thought burberry had it in the bag. 😫 props to sunny tho. 🔥
Am I the only person that likes the fact that ive got a good 6-7 months of battles to look forward to? The anticipation makes it better and when we get to later rounds and better skaters the anticipation will be even bigger.
Not being a hater , but come on man this is the battle at the berrics , the most talented flatground skaters of the world , this is disrespecful to flatground skaters and their dream to be on the berrics one day , these 2 kids do not deserve to be there
Hey erry Midler gave you that nollie tre cuz u fuckin needed it lol
Reminder Burberry Erry is injured, that's why he struggled so much with kickflip variations. Also come on this was fun, I don't need them to be pulling crazy tricks to make it fun. I'm glad the berrics added the influencer bracket
everyone in the comments is pissed, completely understandable. Im just happy I don't have to see this Burberry guy again
is there a bracket challenge for this batb?
I guess he’s only good I’m instagram
Sunny didn't pop the fakie 3 shuv
Yikes!
Me and my friends could have gave a better skate game... This was booooooooooring
Honestly I was disappointed. Erik looked extremely uncomfortable u can see it in his kickflip, hope he feels himself better on scenes like this in future
2:47 doesnt counts obviously, he touched ground wtf
Burberry is so bad in flatground tricks though
Wtf was this...
Not surprised that burberry kid struggles wearing them loose as clunky trainers
Kanye East will be upset
I’m an old man and I know this But I can’t with this dudes hair?
This is Instagram Vs reality, i'm so happy to see this guy getting destroyed by a kid.  Keep doing your shitty edit with 1000$ ugly shoes!
Not worth the wait. Berrics needs to pick up the pace or people are going to snooze this thing.  Starting off with so many influencer games is bad composition. If you're going to do an influencer match you gotta put in an icon match the same weekend to get people to care. Influencers are influencers to people who don't skate. Hoping The Berrics reads the comments so they can make changes.
Sure there were some shaky tricks, but Burberry had those 360 shuvs and tres looking effortless
The comments 😭😭😭😂😂😂
Please please please whoever does the editing, zoom in on the person that advances in the bracket at the end. I literally never see it and it’s tedious pausing to look for it because I end up clicking on the next video trying to rewind.
I’ve seen better games of skate in front of Walmart
How did he fuck up a kickflip twice
Kinda more swag than style am I right
don't F judge people if you don't know them  sunny for the win the first kickflip thooo!?!?!
Soy yo o Burberry se dejo ganar????
UNEXPECTED NGL CONGRATS SUNNY AM HYPED HE WON🔥🔥🔥🔥
Everybodys pumped right?  Everybody: 🦗🦗🦗
Son of Kratos vs Tony hawks undergrounds NPC, interesting 🤔
How does Burberry afford so many dope Jordan’s and off whites? Anyone know?
It's a walkover for Giger, Griffin and Hill...
There should at least be 3 games a week. Friday Saturday and Sunday. Or two each on Saturday and Sunday. At this rate I’m going to be in a nursing home by the time it finishes
Steve Berra at the end cringe worthy
Burberry's foot placement sucks for midtop/hightop shoes
that line up is amazing so many talented skaters competing fuck yeah
Hoo da fok are these guys?
Boa Sunnyzin tava torcendo por vc
Good on Erry for stepping out of his comfort zone on this one. Feel like his biggest battle was with anxiety. Sunny also stepped it up big time, he's gotten way better.
Ridiculous.
That was... was... what...that what... what that... was... what was that?
Game fraquinho
Very,very shit kkkk
Sunny dats my dawg 😈
Burberry needs to tie his fucking shoes.
I don’t know why everyone is complaining about two games per week?  What’s the hurry ?
I will never understand how anyone skates in those Nike dunks lol
Influencer? You mean Atreus! Son of the God of War Kratos!
So fire Colm is so sick his brand is amazing
Can we just go back to 2009 when skateboarding had some class. I mean come on, Burberry erry? Imagine not even trying to land a kick flip in batb maybe he just had already given up or maybe hes just a little to entitled idk but it's not cool, really disrespectful imo
disappointed
I love Sunnys chain!
Chalk it up to nerves. Burberry was wigging out in his interview so I’m not surprised, he was already in a super negative mindset. Poor dude!
Wow, neither of them should advance
Have no idea who the burberry foo is, but feels like Berra pulled him aside & was like bruh… Sunny’s a movie star, he’s gonna get us clicks, throw the game & I’ll let you be ona berrics. Also, please look shocking for the cameras for more clicks.
4 per week bru i did not wait a week to see this kid burrberry scuff a kickflip
yall should do like 3 or 4 battles a week this is gonna last well into next year at this rate
LUAN AGAIN 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Se o Luan levar a sério  esse BATB 12, pelo menos nas finais ele chega. Isso se não ganhar de novo.
Lol looks like his death blow wasn't very deadly.  Still a pretty solid ass whooping
Burberry's main enemy: kickflips
If berrics saw the games at my park with the homies they’d have to shut down. Dis shit weak
who is the loser with the funny hat. he gives me serious Carrot Top vibes
This should be called "The battle of Cariuma Skaters." out of the 64 skaters over half ride for cariuma. quite the sponsor spot. I think this Batb Is a Sold Out Mess.90% of the cariuma guys cant even kickflip.
at least burberry was a really good sport
sunny should of rocked up with the dinosaur board
People shitting on this game of skate but Sunny was stomping at the beginning and we know Erry CAN skate but clearly wasn’t on point today. Not exciting but they’re both still not bad. Go catch Sunny’s IG that kid fuckin rips.
1:15 sunny squared up to alex LMFAOOO love IC gang
Borest game since Dyrdek vs Koston
why doesn’t sunny have a shirt
That was…. Bad
Honestly was NOT expecting that game to go the way it did at all hahahaha. Sucks for Burberry though with his rolled ankle. His Hardflip was sweet!
Can't wait to see the finals on my damn grave
si acung jago instagram 😂😂😂
no way alex too fuck yeah!!!!!!
Why does burberry look mad
How many signatures do we need on a petition to upload a battle a day
SUNNY FUCKING WON!!!!! HE SKATING LIKE HE GOTTA PROVE A POINT!
Good lord that might be the worst outfit I've ever seen
It's funny that Sunny was in "Mid 90s" but this other dude dresses like he wishes he was from a midwestern suburb in the mid 90s.  I didn't know that kids still dressed like strip-mall goths.
These influencers have convinced me not to waste my time watching them skate!
I know from the first kickflip whoever wins will only win this round.
im early so excited for this love em both
Great job both skaters.  I’d probably whiff an ollie trying to skate this competition from nerves alone.  Also, having rolled ankles before, I know how hard it is to kickflip after ankle injury.  Good on Burberry for competing anyway!
The satanic dude needs to take his devil pentagon off before he stabbs his throat out on a pebble.
Sunny, yesterday my life was been so grayyy...'' uashduashda Good Job dud
We gotta wait a week. For a 4 minute game. I think y'all should save the "deathblow" videos for when they will actually make it far enough to need something more challenging than a Kickflip. Burberry Erry has a one foot 360. . . but cant do a kickflip.
Dudes dressed all extra and didnt even do that good
3 uploads for week please
holy fuck did not expect sunny to win
i was expecting a bit more , maybe flatground isn't their best
Lol damn
Burberry deserved to lose because he keeps stock x tags on his shoes
This was god awful. WE NEED AT LEAST 3 BATTLES A WEEK!
Sunburn vs Satanist?
Winner gets a Hot Topic Gift card
Isn't Sunny's fakie 3 shuv a letter?  He didn't pop it
Bro I feel so bad for erry especially after seeing his insta live
Looks like me and my friends having a game of skate or even worst
This dude can do anything BUT a kickflip
Damn sunny kinda looks like Adam ondra (the best climber in the world)
Esse Burberry só é Skills no Instagram. Ele me desapontou mais que o Versace Plug -.-
Pretty sure if these guys weren’t wearing shoes that are 10 times too big for them, the tricks would of been more consistent. Just an observation 😂🤷‍♂️
I waited a week for that shit
...I waited a week or this? You can't keep doing 2 battles a week. That'll take over 6 months.
64 skaters at 2 Games a week 4 battles in each bracket x6 . This will take a very long time at this pace like 16 weeks Long.
lol damn we exposing these instagram skaters?
the fact that hes skating in aj1 and theres a stockx tag is making me mad
it looks like burberry struggles to skate with those shoes just because the hype. thats one of the most stoopid things ive ever seen
Who else wanted to see that One foot back 3?
Sunny didn't pop a trick
What a boring game 😴
Even the crowd wasn’t into it.
This was kinda boring... I see better games at my local park
Burberry..  he disappointed me like the Versace Plug -.-
Still wait on my man dylan jaeb
Fck, what's this Give me the fcking show !
Game merda
The Burberry kid looks extremely uncomfortable
wait so youre telling me the influencer who just posts slow motion flatground in a skatepark cant kickflip 😱😱😱
how does this man hardflip easier than half cab flips ?!!!
Sunny improved his skills hella quick being around IC, Burberry should’ve just wore regular shoes would’ve did way better
Most doodoo game I've ever seen
is that reese from malcolm in the middle
Who will Be against Jamie Griffin ???
That hard flip at 2:47 should’ve been a redo
Шото тухло (((
Glaive
Sunny reminds me of a Young Mickey Papa
Oh Burberry… It's only good on instagram
Next match for sunny... 😂... Good Luck but ,it's... Ginner😂😆!
gente estranha
Some of y'all new here and it shows. This battle could have been BATB1 finals night worthy
It should be 4 battles per weekend, there's too many of them
You ever see a backyard basketball game on ESPN?
Are these kids amateurs?
This first influencers battle does not suffer well the comparison with the battles held last weekend, to say the least... Hope the rest of the bracket offers better challenge !
Michael Jordan would be pissed
That was so influencing
u couldve picked up any kid out of the skatepark and they would do exactly what ‘burberry’ just did not sure why hes in this at all
poor burberry lmao, thought bro had a chance
2:49 is that sewa
Watching this at 0.75x speed so itll last longer
4:01...lol...I wonder if they meant to leave that in
Burberry is sponsored by stockx he couldn't care less about losing at batb
This is probably the worst game of skate I've ever seen
I thought sunny would lose but WOW. im impressed
Stoked for the final game on New Year’s Eve 2023 😍
BURBERRY U SUK
berry made it seem worse
Mid 2022 is way to far away. Why not do 1 battle from every bracket every weekend? Feed the fans man
Love sunny ever since I watched Mid 90s Great Movie fr hes come a long way skill wise
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOTSSSSSSSSSSSS WHY DOSNT DO FLIPS GOOD???
the fact that hes skating in jordans is annoying
Wow 3 shovit is apparently a tough trick  😂
Yo le hiba al de los pelos parados pero no pudo ni meter las manos jaja
Sunny switch fs heel BUTTERY AS FUCK!
BROO!!! PLSS UPLOAD 3 BATTLES  PER WEEK 2 ISNT ENOUGH
Sunburn’s got a mean flick! 🤘🏽
Burberry needs some shoes tighter on his ankles
What a cringe battle
At this pace, the finals will be held on New Years Eve
Y donde esta el nivel de los buenos competidores?
SunBurnnnn!
Was obvious from the first trick who would win. Burberry should never be invited back for that level of suck
Bruh can’t even do a kickflip 😂 🤣
Aweeeeeeeeeeeeeboooooooooo ganó el sunny
Sunny's got that mid-90's hardflip (inward kickflip)
The anti-capitalist punk who wears nike haha
holy shit sign me up for the next batb, i might be in with half a chance seeing this
Burberry erry is so disappointing
yessir sunny
That did not go how I thought it would. LMAO.
bush…
Yall gotta remember Burberry rolled his ankle a couple days ago dude still did great 👍 👏
SUNNY

Sunny squaring up to Midler after the ro sham bo😂
Damnn! Everyone thought wrong.
