Yes here in 2025!! We need a Silk Sonic reunion! This is my favorite live performance of theirs.. they are both so immensely talented and that ending was some of the best music I have ever heard in my entire life (I’m 49) incredible harmonizing!!!
Best collab of the 21st century.
Vai tomar... Agora um café! Porra.
It's 100% percent the same as the recording!  Bruno Mars vocals are in another level!

See u soon my love bruno here in PH🥰😭
The American’s singers  are ours masters
É a música mais romântica do mundo e eu dedico a você Ruano.
watching this in 2025 cuz it's that good the whole vibe.
the note change on the last "LIKE I WANNNNNT YA BABY" keeps me coming back
bruno rules, and that .paak guy is smooth as silk too.  he just started dating mariah.  good match.  would love to see them sing a love song duo.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Yes are you good but i Love Bruno  Mars
I Love you Bruno

MARCH 20,2025
Watching this masterpiece in 2025
The price is right 2026😂
smooth perfect presentation loved it
Michael Jackson 😢
Honestly, perhaps the best written and performed song of the last 20 years. To think sounds like this were a dime a dozen back in my day. That shows just how shitty todays top 40 radio is...
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
If I see another person asking "who still watch this in 2024" Like who isn't watching this they did OUTSTANDING!❤️
Love this song
😮❤❤ I love your songs
❤ 😍 ❤
Thanks for ever maistro''''''wouuuuuuuuj
I appreciate Bruno for all the times he helped me get laid 💯
2025 yes
너무 좋다
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ya pasaron 4 años?????😮
A small taste of what my generation grew up with in the 1970’s🎤
This IS paradise musique''' eyyyyyyyooo yeeeeee'''''real'''''''veridict'''''''thanqs for ever maistro'''''''''''respect crew
So awezome
I've felt it since a long time ago, but Brunomas' songs have all the elements that Koreans like, and I can always hear one or two Brunomas' songs on the streets of Korea, whether it is a Hongik University bar that goes to Gangnam cafe, and I wonder if there is a pop star with such popularity and skills. lol When we had a concert in Korea, it was sold out in 2 hours, lol
진짜 예전부터 느꼈는데 브루노마스 노래들은 한국인들이 좋아하는요소를 모두갖춤,,, 한국 거리에서도 강남카페를 가던 홍대술집에서든 브루노마스 노래 한두곡은 꼭 들리고,,,이만한 대중성과 실력을 다 갖춘 팝스타가 있을까 싶음,,,,ㅋㅋ 내한 콘서트 했을때도 2시간만에 매진됬었지,,,ㅋㅋㅋ
‏‪3:38‬‏ his voice here oh my goddd
4025 anyone????😮😮😮😮😮
2025, still love this song, and i love forever

15 days away from 2025 and here I am enjoying this incredibly cool topic. 🙌🏼
2024 dezembro ❤
Bruno Mars might be the best singer alive today
Peak male vocalist. I'm always a skeptic when modern artists release music-- I'm always the secret hater thinking "I need to hear it live to be impressed". This is me being impressed.
Que espetáculo!!
❤❤❤
Whos still listening to this song in 2024, love this song.
Bruno is that guy ❤
These brothers dress like some pimps
I couldn't go to bruno's show in RJ. I'm already singing the chours, Silk Sonic (come to Brazil 🇧🇷) PLEASE 2025.

HERMOSAMENTE BELLO ,DIOS QUE BELLA VOZ BRUNO MARS
🧔1 John 5-10. And this is the message🔉 which we have heard from him and 🔊proclaim to you: that God is light🌟 and in him there is no darkness at all🌑. 6 If we say that we have fellowship with him, and yet walk in the darkness (sin), we lie and do not practice the truth. 7 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from all sin. 8 If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. 9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. 10 If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.
I love this song.       Very sensual

How does Bruno Mars show up with those vocals EVERY. TIME. 🥹
"I ain't playing no game every word that i said coming straith from my pant" 😹
Lyrics and Steps so on point... and that 70s vibe....yessssa!!!!❤❤❤
WOW! Fucking AWESOME!
This aged really well!❤
1978... a man in a white van with candies and heroine... circling around a park.
Their look is so reminiscent of the 70’s soul bands.  I could listen to this all day every day & never get bored of it.  Just realised I posted a similar message a while ago.  Must be having a senior moment.  Do I care - nah.  I’m a recycled teenager anyway! ❤
❤😊😊
Simplesmente sensacional 😄
How is this SO PERFECT?
✨
Still the best version of this song
As one who was a teenager in the 70’s, let me confirm, verify, and sanction this as a top tier 1970’s transport back in time performance!
Omg sooooooo gooooood
Flawless perfection 🎶🎤

TREVOR NOAH 😱
62 and loving Bruno
Excellent! Bruno is an fabulous singer among his other musical gifts! Truly excellent! And the whole group is top notch. Anderson is a great match up with Bruno on a wonderfully real music song!!!! Hats off to Silk Sonic!!
Come on Bruno. Waiting on something new…. like this vibe!!!
Still don't know y this hasn't been laid down and released ... This whole song is immaculate 👌👌🥰
The guy doesn't know how to make a bad song,ever!

Pretty sure they're lip syng'g
Love it!
I’ve never heard a song Bruno is on that’s a flop. All his features have been so good as well. 😅 Anderson is incredible too!! Such a vibe!
❤❤
Love old school harmony
You know the artist is good when the live is even better than the original
❤❤❤❤
Good stuff guys❤❤
Please tell me if I’m wrong, does Bruno Mars and his company remind you of the old school choreography? Like the Temptations, Ike and Tina, The Miracles and all the other groups from the 70s and early 80s
今更やけど、うますぎるわ どーしたらこんな声でんの
### Je comprends  1. **Ce passage descriptif est extrait d'un récit. Qu'est-ce qui le prouve?**  Il raconte une histoire avec des détails sur ce qui se passe et où cela se passe.  ### Je développe  1. **En quelle saison sommes-nous?

On le voit avec les descriptions du froid, du silence, et de la neige partout.  7. **Trouve un autre titre à ce texte.**  "Un Hiver Rigoureux"  ### Je retiens  Ce type de description veut faire ressentir une impression forte au lecteur, en utilisant des mots qui évoquent des images et des comparaisons.
너무 황홀하다

Sandra I Love.❤
Very good video I really liked it keep it up bruno 1:22

Me encanta esta canción, me traslada a los años 80.❤😊
Watching 2025 anyone?❤
📢Bruno Mars ao vivo ficou fenomenal, quem sabe faz ao vivo! Balada doce e melódica perfeita para ouvir e imaginar...🎶🤩😍👏👏👏❤
Hey ghosts, come out again and stun the world!!! I am that senior that really love you both as Silk Sonic and individual song birds!! Keep doing what you both do; you’re the best!!!🙏🏼🙏🏼❤️
Bruno Mars! Yes that voice.
Wow ♡
Esse cara canta demais
It’s 2024 and yes I still play this performance religiously 😂  But let’s talk about that note Anderson Pakk hit at 1:46 “And if you’re hungry, girl I got Fileeeeet” 🔥🔥🔥🔥
His door better be open❤😊

2024 🇧🇷
I can come in the door anytime ! Beautiful mens!
I love this song ❤❤  Song is 🤌🤌 Song Vibe hits so hard in 💘
I wonder if this is the key to getting older generations to love new pop artists.  Do a track to show you can do their style, and then invite them to listen to something that excites you as a young artist.
How i wanted have lived in the 70 and 80 Years.
2024
Da baby is so talented
I am crying because the extra end is so beautiful and smooth😢😢
I cant even find the words. Except maybe thank you fr restoring my faith in "Black" Music. Theres hope for America yet.
This is dope, but wait till people find out who the thee sacred souls are.  Lol
This it best version of this song
HOW DID I MISS THIS SUCH OF PERFORMANCE 😱
Silk Sonlck y Bruno Mars lo máximo ❤
I love it❤
So nice to hear it LIVE!!!!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ 3:45
A💋😊
❤❤❤
If you have been following Bruno’s career you would have known he has giving us every era of music from the doo wop to today…just need the 80’s and 90’s now 💯
Eres de los mejores parcero 👍👍
Wow !  Fantastic !!
진짜 사람 ㆍ😂
어거  ㅇㆍ니다
진짜 왜그러니 사랑해  근데욕하지마요 사랑하는 거잖아
Wow love this song
that last little breakdown… wow
❤❤❤
I can watch it over and over…. I love 70’s music. This is something else…I think it’s a modern masterpiece . In an interview Bruno told them it started off as a joke on a tour bus during the Covid pandemic. They were just fooling around with some notes until , I think Paak said. “ I think we’ve got something here…” They got a 70’s legend to help create the song for them.
Uma delícia  de música  boa para dançar
Bom demais!! Quanto mais  eu ouço mais tenho vontade de ouvir
lo maximo bruno mars
All I can say is DAMN....
미쳤다..브루노마스 사랑해요..
Love Bruno Mars

Surely Bruh it's Awesome
Silk sonic is such a beautiful talent group! Bruno  and Anderson Park!
✌️

This is one of the best performances I have ever seen
Nothing like good ole music
True artists, a top shelf performance coming straight from the heart , you can feel the easiness , even though they have put so much work in it and that is why tears of joy are bursting from people's eyes...   a Grammy 🎺 is not enough to express the true appreciation for this classic .
Smooth as silk!
crazy voice
Fo sho !!!
밀양 박씨 최고의 아웃풋 앤더슨 팩 ㅋㅋㅋ

The star of star of star......
60s/70s soul will forever be the best era ...even today we love that vibe.
Song of the century!!!!!!!?
Back to 1970s oh yes ❤

my fucking god
Live version much better 😮😮😮😮
if they ever do a movie on Sammy Davis Jr. , Bruno Mars would be great as Sammy.
jeezus, this is sick, the way he sings that part between 3:05-3:23 ....goosebumps through my soul
My favorite version. Classic!
👏👏👏♪♪♪♪💃🙋
Here in 2024 and loving this for the umpteenth time.   Leaving that door open 🥰

Brings back the 80 & 90's vibe....WOW!!! Awesome Talent
Do Better, INO.
That's how to do it
Evergreen song❤

Bruno looks Like Sammy Davis Jr singing the hell outta this song
1:45
Beautifully sang.
반짝이는 하트선글라스 음악과 너무 잘어울려요. 노래도 넘 좋아요
This song has Motown vibes written all over it. The funny thing is that Motown had actually signed Bruno Mars to a music contract, but after a year they ended the contract. Big miss by Motown. Destiny is something that cannot be changed. An incredible collaboration between these two gentlemen.
Brilliant ❤
That classic R&B groove will always sound great no matter the era...ya grands music.
Awesome!!
Parabéns 👏👏👏👏 Vcs canta muito ❤❤ Amo muito !
👍😊🙃😌 #forexjehovahswitnesses #fordisfellowshippedones
Gawddddd totally totally rocking it these guys are legendary!
Brought back some major classy 60 and 70s men Groups
Bruno mars  Anderson park sings to good together and Bruno mars is so cute to me.  And  he sings so good and hard. I love it.
Why does it feel like a Dave Chapelle skit lol
Great  talent as long as Bruno is part of the mix it is going to be amazing but they both are both amazing good luck soulsonic and I love you guys beautiful and I'm old school everybody got to eat

bruno is the best of all
DECEMBER 1, 2023.    1:18 PM  STILL LISTENING FOR THE 51ST TIME.
It's awesome that younger people are producing music like this, going back to the 70's.  Nice to see performers that sing, dance and entertain on another level.  Us oldies appreciate it.
❤
I think they found the Silk Sonic Time machine. They came like a cure to the lost music industry, which had been bleeding for the last 15 years.
3:21 cant get over with this
아련한 마음을 어디에 전해야할까  듣기만 해도 너무 좋은걸  지난 추억의  기억과 현재의 나와 미래의 너까지 같이  있는 기분

They didn't even send in this song in the 2021 Grammy's.  The next year they won 4 of them thanks to this song.
Very poor lines..Y u got 2look gofieY ?? Nite..
Can we just give a hell yeah to how gorgeous Trevor Noah looks or is it Noah Trevor I apologize sincerely it's my birthday and I'm high as a motherfuker😂😂😂😂
you've sur classed MJ in that moment !
I love how Motown/‘70’s soul this is. I think Bruce has single-handedly brought real quality and entertainment back to pop music.
Apaixonada pelo Bruno Mars!! Canta muito e acima de tudo é carismático. Nem se fala na firma humilde que se apresenta com a sua banda.
❤❤❤

I said it before and I will say it again. “Seek ye first the Kingdom of God…. “ but Bruno is so so so talent by God’s Grace and Glory, but does any other women notice his package? I mean he is packin’. His moves and talent, and that he is packing. I just can’t help but notice. Lust aside. Really, lust aside, I guess? I hope he makes babies with God and a woman he deeply loves above all other women.
They are fantastic together!! On point with everything!!
Fuxkin crazy
So beautiful ❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😊
That was old school as s#@t. Takes me to back in the day. These guys killed it. I felt like I was in my 20's again listening to them.

Chapeau l'artiste
The key change at 2:39 just thrills me everything. And the lush maj 7th chords. So smooth, just like a newborn.
Greatness
Hace años que no escuchaba a Bruno Mars y este live me dio un escalofrío
Too much damn swag it... it aint right 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
너무 좋으네요. 이런음악들이 세상에서 다 사라진줄 알았네요.
감미롭네~
진짜 너무 좋아.. 내가 박효신 노래 말고 무한반복으로 듣는건 처음이다..ㅎ❤
First class 👍
무한반복❤

Best of the best
처음 듣자마자 너무 좋아서 한곡 무한반복으로 미친듯이 들었는데ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ아직도 안질림 걍 황홀함..라이브 ㅁㅊㄷ..🥹🤎
I am crazy in love with Anderson. He even hums good. I only hope he loves The Lord Jesus the Christ. And I want to know who he has tatted on his chest. It is never too late while breathing to give all the Glory to You4 Creator, The Trinity. That can change on a dime. But, big tatooes like Anderson has, well that is probably never going to transform while breathing on plant earth. I would just use them as a part of my testimony in my come to Jesus conversion. So tattoes are no biggy. God can use them for his Glory, whatever they mean or were meant for.
Amo esta canción!!!
Phenomenal! It was an honor to have watched you on stage in manila @brunomars! Mahal ka namin! #proudfilipino
Them Boyz in the back hell with moves....Bruno and Anderson amazing
Bruno una voz grandiosa  exelente 👍
Amazing.
아니야 그래도 이건 아니야 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ ㅈㄴ똑같은데 아니야 이러지마 제발
솔직히 ㅈㄴ 똑같네요 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ아아아아     소름 끼쳐 ㅋㅋㅋ 미쳤다  그냥편해질래 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅅㅂ ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
That's so inspiring.  Wow!
💖
❤😍😆
최고!!!!!
Chills over and over
I like Bruno with the voice , but Anderson Pak is something to see . Playing  drums and singing at the same time in concert  is awesome.
😊😊😊❤❤❤🎉 It's my birthday. Nobody wants to say happy birthday😢
미쳤다 진짜ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
Smooth moves and sounds.  Love them.
이 조합 너무 매력 있음 ㅎㅎ  신나는 율동이랑  복고풍 의상. 하트 반짝이 썬글까지 완벽함....보컬의 신들 덕분에 천국의 문이 미친듯.. 열리는 것 같구나.. ㅎㅎ 타고난 끼를 많이들 보여 주시길 기원 합니다. ㅎ
오빠 사랑해여❤

Bruno mars is the greatest singer of the modern day. He needs to make more music
Pretty sure I'm pregnant 65 seconds into the song!, wife is gonna be pissed!
❤lo❤
They were so smooth with it.
Gf
한국 콘서트때 꼭 불러주오 나 이노래에 꽂혀 당신 사랑하게 됌❤
Eu aqui em 2023 ouvindo esse clássico, que voz! nao canso de ouvir❤.
I love you sweetheart ❣️
Talentosos
I love this song🫠🫠🫠🫠🫶🫶🫶🥰🥰🥰🥰☺️😊😌!
Bruno sounds like an Angle. This is a glimpse of Heaven on earth.
Underrated no more. Break out star for me. Seriiiiioooosssssly crazy in love with Anderson. His wife is a very special woman to marry him. I hope he has a kid or four. Pass that talent on. Bruno too. Thanks be to Bruno, Anderson gets to shine. Before Silk Sonic I had no idea what a multi-gifted man he was. Heck, I didn’t even hear of him. I did not know he existed. Anderson kills me. They are all slaying me. An army of talent. Love the horn section too. Glory to The Trinity for stirring these musicians together. Jesus You are the Original gangster. Holy, Holy, Holy be to His precious Creation in making theses men. 😂🤣🤩🥳🎹🎤🎸🥁🎷🎺🤣🧔‍♀️🫶🐕😎
Their music in Silk Sonic is a natural high. The best medicine for slaying all the my demons I am fighting with in my life, and with Silk Sonic I am able to take a time out, and get healing from their music. Just levitate and sooth the savage beast inside. Praise and all Glory to you Lord Jesus, ( I am not ashamed to call out the Source of all this talent). So any haters to my testimony about what Silk Sonic means to me, especially in this chaotic times we are in, I would suggest to go read a good book, or go to the beach,   and if you are really evil, then pound sound.
God bruno mars
Amo essa musica
Uptown funk you up
Bruno Mars is undoubtedly the greatest talent of gen Z. Cant forget Paak’s stunning vocals. This is one of the best duos of all time.

Bruno forever
"So Sweet, So Taaaah!" 😎😘
I'm here 2 years later, and I am always amazed and fascinated and elated (positive adjectives what not)with their live version. In one interview, Anderson.Paak described Bruno as a Filipino/Puerto Rican angel who came into his life. They have a great friendship and the best music chemistry! Hoping for an upcoming album. 🥰💯✅
Y ressemble à grim un peu
When I hear these pieces of art, I just think about how human bing is so special

I'm going on 72 and This is my favorite Jam !! It makes these Old drops of blood warm up and flow !! I Love me some Bruno Mars !!❤
B-R-I-L-L-I-A-N-T !!!  😍Wow!  Awesome performance and superb presentation! 🤩 BRAVO, Bruno Mars!  What a great (nostalgic) sound!
You literally have a beautiful voice
esta cancion me recuerda a mi viaje a Tarapoto ... q recuerdo...
Am i crazy that every song he sang is ahead of every time can recognize music❤
Hola genio
My guess, by the nature of the performance production, is that there was a significant group of the audience that was under the influence of legal* psychedelic chemicals, like muscimol for example. I don't know, I've just seen the stuff too much, it's too good at stuff. I'm choosing my words very carefully
Perfecto
Charismatic, sexy and just obvious talent ...Wow what a song and performance . Class n talent long may they continue...They just sing amazingly together and with their back up guys they are all fabulous ❣❣❣❣👍🌞🌞🌞🌞  Fantastic ❣❣❣❣❣
Lalalaaaaaaaaaaa Lalalalaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Anderson is under rated. The both of them sound great togerher..
Beautiful.
진짜 미쳤다
Fun fact ,Both Bruno and Anderson has 1/4 Asian blood in their veins
شاهکاره 👍🏼
👍
Boa noite, vamos nessa voar !!Show que brilha no ceu e na terra !! Amei é minha essa

Beautiful ❤️🌹 your best thing that ever happened to me
Bruno has that stage swag ❤️❤️❤️🫶🎤
Still blown away by this song!
Absolutely Beautiful.
He looks so like Michael Jackson in the Jacksons five era, and this whole band, vibe, and outfits
This must be what it felt like to watch the greatest Motown stars in the 70s - simple but you FEEL it! That’s how the Baby Boomer generation got its name - by listening to some good ol’ fashioned baby making music! Lol🥰
I adore this 😘👋❤️
Bruno Mars tem um talento ... ele faz a gente se emocionar com sua musica e sua dança !! Maravilhoso ....
geniusssssss
Silk Sonic's performance in this is one of the very few that sounds even better live than on the studio version.
Se que no es intencional artista es artista pero dónde aparezcas tu Bruno Mars opacas a cualquier estrella te adoro muchas bendiciones y Miles éxitos
omfg they just rizzed me up bro
wow
摯愛火星哥🥰

The best new song reminding me of the good ol’ old songs. You did it again Mr. Mars. Make me so happy to hear this kinda music again.. for real 🎸🎤🎼❤️
내 사랑 브루노야 제발 팩이랑 내한 한 번만 해주라 10년 다 되가잖아 지쨔 언제올건데 일본만 찍고 가버리는게 어딨어 질투나 정말 한국에 당신 팬이 얼마나 많은데 떼창의 민족이 당신을 기다린다구 황홀하게 해줄게 또 오고싶게 해줄게 부탁이야ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅜ곧 투어할거라했다며 믿는다? 이 노래 라이브로 한 번만 듣게 해줘 평생 착하게 살게ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ

I totally adore Bruno mars...form day one.    🕊🇺🇲💕
I even set up Charles Cooper Jr, Mexico would rather be with me now and Miss Gail Miller, Swanigan,St
I'm going in time out, Red Rover Red Rover come on over
Because you're not Gail Miller, the closest to the floor is the devil, is she still ain't going to see no replacement like that
But don't disrespect bow down 1974
It's easier to bring you back, AGirl,why u looking at me girl, look across the room and ask him why would you take that from me,
If I ask you you why do you need what I got,?
If I ask you a question would you give me the answer,
Hey girl, I didn't say u girl,she with me,
Ain't nobody got time for that!!!!A-girl,She with me  girl,But ain't nobody got time for that, blackswan
I have never had a happy place.  This song is now my happy place.🥰🥰  Thank you from the heart:  Bruno, Anderson & Silk Sonic! xoxo

와 그냥 쩐다...진짜 개쩐다 폼 미쳤다라나 뭐라나 그냥 개쩐다 와...
Absolutely priceless! I love it
總是療癒我
Bruno carries this song so hard
B
You know in todays “music” culture, true talent lies where if the power goes out, the concert can keep going! There’s literally very few who can do that. Here’s two of them….
nice song
Pambihirang pagkaka husay ga nareng kababayan kong are,pagkakahusay mo talaga Bruno Mars eh eh ware koy nag iisa are sa larangan ng musika.
Why is nobody talking about Bruno's note at 3:20? Better than the studio recording imo, they knocked it out of the park
Old school funk beat!
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😁😁
Love this!
Just think all the instruments were live too, not using the computer generated sounds. Gotta give them whole enchilada 😀
이 무슨 그냥 음원 씹어먹었네... 라이브 끝내준다...👍
Congratulations to creating truly authentic, genuine music here.    Just real listenable  straight-to-heart performance, writing, and production.  Very, very rare to behold such phenomenal megastar talent today as it was in the era this hearkens to.  It's like this song and performance was written in 1974 as a #1 hit tune in a parallel universe, and we're just seeing the light from the star now.
This quartet reminds me of Confunkshun!! Singing these melodies that we women love to hear!! Their's nothing Wrong when it comes to Singing about Love!! It's what this world needs more of!! Thanks Silk Sonic for giving us this Jam💗💗💗💗
Someone is off their meds. for them to not like this BEAUTIFUL song.  BARS!😂
✨✨✨👑👑🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥⚡️🌎⚡️🔑❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥✨✨✨
💖💖💖
22년에 들어도 개좋다
Con este tema se eriza la piel porque es una sensacion de enamoramiento, tristeza, alegría. Bruno un tipaso y sus músicos igual. Simplemente espectacular!!!! Desde Coahuila, México.
좋다

Now that's the True Old School Flavor that's been missing from music for Far too long. These Brothers are Badass right down to the Bell Bottoms of the time.

It’s that legal that I watched a live this good without paying any shit or something?
This would be a hit in all of the last 6 decades!
🥰❤️👍!
자기들만 부르려고 만든 노래가 확실해 천재들❤🎉

I remind the sound by M. Love Smith.
Babe don't keep me waiting ✨🌠💯

These dudes are born in the wrong era, but boy was we lucky to listen to this.
No one literally no one is talking about how smooth that switch was.
INIGUALÁVEL.
Love them all~*
👏👏👏

I don’t think the door will ever be closed… for that one.
Bruno is just…everything bro😭❤️
Isso é simplesmente maravilhoso. Uma obra sensacional e ficará para posteridade pelo primor de imagem, excelência em voz e perfeição dos três pilares musical. Melodia, harmonia e ritmo. Bruno Mars é  de fato uma jóia rara. Parabéns pela obra.
Novembro 2022 🇧🇷🇧🇷❤️
PERFEITA SINCRONIA 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
I’m so glad they released this as a single. This is just as good as the original. More artists need to release their award show performances.
A timeless melody... the guys created a classic here...and that break into the ending is incredible 3:32.... & that duet goodness 3:44🤦‍♂
브루노 너란 놈은 그 끝이 어딘거냐
Masterpiece 👌👌👌😘
Masterpiece. Bruno Mars is on fire
2:11오르가즘
Unbelievably nice!!
So insink,beautiful music,so fresh.
Omg love this song so damn much
미친라이브 ㅠ
나 팝송 너무 허세같은 분위기라 안좋아하는데 이 노래듣고 미쳤다…  내 차에서 계속 들려 어케
Sounds is breath taking very good
Vocês arrasam amooo👏🏽🥰🎶
🎤❤️👑✨
could you imagine if either bruno or anderson came out in the 70s-80s, they’d be so unimaginably popular it would be amazing, too bad they’re being somewhat overshadowed by the terrible trendy music out today
Simplesmente amo muito
Extraordinarios músicos !
Una  pregunta esta canción de cuando es 😅
너무너무 사랑해요
Give her a key...
I love the 70s feel. Who can tell that this song came out in 2021.
Чистый восторг!
Love you shows⭐❤️⭐
Masterpiece
Everytime i think bruno is singing autotune or playback he does some sick variations... And then i realise he doesnt need that. He s just that good.
Jo ta!
I personally love this song the harmony is very well done. Why doesn't Bruno sing the whole lead. Not that  Anderson puts a good harmony.  With the song. He dose I just think Bruno is the whole Song by himself. This is  My personal opinion.
6/11/22
Bruno oozes soul 🥰
That's why I say that this is when will you grow up today good 🥰 sounds you can fell words big please ☺️ take time an 👂 to some real music 🎼🎶 💕💕 your music
Quando tocou a última vez foi dia 30 você tava tão confusa que você falou que nós estamos no baile do curso dia 13 de julho foi quarta-feira você tava tão tava tão fácil pegar as coisas de você você trata tão nervosa tão enrolada que você não prestava atenção no que você falava nisso desculpa Ou então o que tá escrito tá parecendo discutido cada coisa chapada se um dia tiver oportunidade eu te falo
Q música maravilhosa me trás boas lembranças q som q gingado ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Leave door open
Listen to brunos part (around 0:15) on 0.75 and 1.25 you won’t regret it
Damn! I got chills every second of this performance!
It is such good lockdown music. I listened to it like every day.
Stunning shining fantastic guys♡
Adoro vocês 🇧🇷🇧🇷❤️❤️
Oh my God he should have steak instead of Lay's ok

This great song is the only song in 2022 that brings me back to 1979 and the great undisputed Era of fantastic music this is a gem
👏👏👏 bravo! Tambien por el vestuario y la coreografía 👏👏👏
Left Speechless... 3:50
Went to the concert in Sydney on October 15....it was the best concert I have been to after MJ

Silk Sonic Singing Group are the smooth Sexy  Male dancer's I have ever enjoyed.  Whoever is the choreographer for  the Silk Sonic's  Is a genius.     Wow Lawd .💋💖💋😁
⛩welcome🎉to💃Japan😊
Bruno is a Hawaiian Sammy Davis Jr A Super Talent✨️😇✨️😇✨️
The combination of your voices compliments each other..love you Anderson
Ito yung mga kanta na dapat noon pa 70s or 80s erelease. Kaso naitago. Nahukay ni Bruno. Tapos ginandahan pa. Hehehe panalo!
The tweaks to the melody -- for both of them -- were exceptional. "My houuuuuse clean...my poooooool warm..." "...If you're hungry, girl, I got fllettttts...." So sood. Needless to say, Mars' "...want me like I waaaaaant you tonight" was incredible.
Sehalus sutra selembut awan
미쳤다 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Just heavenly AAAAMAAAZIIINNNGGG!!!❤️
Нет слов.. сплошная любовь..❤💜❤️💜❤️🫦❤️❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥  ahh endlessly loveee❤️🫶
우리 박씨 가문중 가장 유명한 사람이 스타가 탄생했네
Simplesmente fodaaa
Obsessed! Need more of Bruno.. what an absolute legend 😍
MICHAEL jACKSON Y FREDY MERCURY.... BRUNO MARS ES AUTENTICO Y ÚNICO! Y ANDERSON.PAAK..PUFFFF
너무 좋아서 잠을 잘수가없네요 ♡
2:11 notice how bruno starts with his arms open but that note is so high and difficult he MUST tighten up his chest to deliver such magic. Its quite interesting how at first he was ready for it but the second time he DELIVERED 🔥🔥🔥 best male singer of our generation
I love this version!
We might be thinking about batteries. Into climate change.  Thats another reason for dancing.
The best of 2021
no wonder this song won 4 grammys, its such a complex song, with musical Arhchitecture that we dont hear nowadays
Live vocals!!
The way they did this reminds me of the Temptations.  FANTASTIC JOB!!!
Amei essa música é o estilo deles.
Bruno Mars and Anderson Paak are amazing…  gracefully, humbly and most importantly, sexually, bowing out of the Grammys 😂
He's attractive 😚
This is emotional for me! No ugly!!!
ALL TIME LEGEND
Yo podria hacer mil cosas con esta canción por favor!!!!
I love how they just serenading for the ladiezz... 🥁🎵😢😢🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲
I like the extended verse
This is lovely.....
I dont know how many times i watch and listened to this song, how i really love the these two combined their talents and silk sonic, they are really amazing especially bruno he's my favorite artist ❤️
So Elegant, Classic, Romantic. 😍😍😍
Wow can these men can sing! 😍😍
A musical marvel. I love
I love Bruno so much
Lol  great line!  and BTW I agree wholeheartedly Highlife 😊 Alma
I love these guys.  They make a song stick to your heart and soul.  keep doing what you do guys.  I am in your corner.
Es maravillosa!!!!!!!. What a wonderful live version!. OMG!
Me encanta Bruno Mars
Can't remember the last time I heard a duo compliment each other so. KC & JoJo? 🤷🏿‍♂️ Somebody help me out lol
Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hermosa melodía, cómo la música de antaño aquella que estremecía el almaaaa
when you know how talented you are you're not afraid of let you vocalist steal the show, right bruno, whitney and michael
This is when silk sonic took over the world
들어도 들어도 너무 좋은~
Bruno Mars não erra em uma música meus amigos. ❤
I didn't know Bruno Mars was Puerto Rican
AMAZING!! 🔥❤️

Masterpiece BORTHA
So 70s.....takes me back❤💋
Que banda maravilhosa...amo demais!! Dá uma sensação tão boa quando ouço essa música...que delicia...
Why Anderson Paak look like a Dave Chappelle impersonation?
Thank you for bringing back R&B
💯 all real singing.
I don't think they are real......
Wow! Anderson Paak's voice is beautiful! I knew he had a lot of good songs. But Silk Sonic really displays his vocal abilities.
Bruno ist really from another (Music-)Planet...
Excelentísima interpretación me enamoré
Sitting here crying thinking how much Bruno looks like my husband God I miss him so much
Esse Bruno  canta mt
Que hermosa canción, preciosa. Interpretación magistral. Me transporta a la década de los 70s. Gracias es genial. Me encanta esta canción.
Bruno and Anderson are coming to Boston but as a senior can’t go the tickets are so Expensive seniors love good music too
👍
This is a great song - timeless
just AMAZING 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 both total professionals
This version is better than the record version!
such a fascinating performance without the use of materialistic things
I love that they used their actual voices in the song instead of massive autotune so they sound the same when they go live  (did you have a stroke reading that?.. sorry..)
Just a reminder that this is live. Lol
Sooo on point and smooth....luv it
Bruno vc é incrível como ao vivo consegue ser melhor que em estúdio, aliás ele é bom de ouvir de qualquer jeito ❤
This is so beautiful
I don't remember help me
Sonic iconic 💓
What a masterpiece!!!
Los Amo, me encanta su música y esa combinación, Son Únicos ❤️💖

Amo esta música e estes cantores maravilhosos 🥰😍

I love Bruno Mars so much. His music is so sensual
真是渾然天成
Bruno killin it my boy doin the damn thang
It’s a crime to sound this good live
Maravilhoso!!!
For you young fellas, Debarge did it first. Listen to some of his music.
Mutual respect...
Bruno in this era is so hot😭
This is my baby he is bi_racial just like Bruno and they bad as hell don't be mad cause u don't have it going on like they do
I look too good To be alone
Bahhh vcs né deixam eufórica.Dopamina pura rsrsrs Muito grata!
Taste, in all things is personal. If it were not then All would be the same. So thankful for the differences, I'd hate to repeat my past over and over.
PLEASE COME TO EUROPE!!!
My sister likes Bruno mars
I have a friend that loves this song
So much talent; love this song!
Jesus Christ Saves  Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is returning very soon, and is the reason for all of the things that are happening on the Earth right now. This planet is on borrowed time.  Jesus Christ died on a cross, was buried in a tomb, and rose from the dead 3 days later, to pay for the sins of mankind, to give us eternal life and forgiveness from God.  EXACTLY how to be Saved by Jesus Christ, the Son of God:  1. Confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord.  2. Believe in your heart that God has raised Jesus Christ from the dead.  Biblical References: 1. Romans 5:9 2. Romans 3:23 3. Romans 6:23 4. Romans 10:9 5. Romans 10:13 6. Ephesians 2: 8 & 9 7. John 3:16  God bless you, peace be with you always. Thank you for your time.
It's amazing to hear that Bruno's voice has no different between studio ver. and live. Just about to say wow!
Bruno the reincarnation of Bobby Debarge frfr
Can't  get enough of this sound..perfect harmony...this is my 76th time hearing this song. I ❤️  it...I ❤️ this video.
Wow... wtf did I just watch?! Is this 2021 for real?! :D
Smovve likke buttaaa
i was blushing on how good this song was
Where my obsession with Silk Sonic began
Bom pra caralho, Bruno e Anderson, foda!
Voci stratosferiche. Si chiama Mars del resto
Great Team, Outstanding Singing Guys, Continue Success and may Greatness continue to be with you. God Bless

NICE
Beautiful version
BRILLIANT !!!! 👍
Increíbles voces ✨✨🤩 Cantan tan increíblemente 🤩🤩
Bruno's voice is so perfect. it gives me chills😵‍💫
👍👍👍👍👍👍😘😘😘😘😘
In the world of constant bombardment of music that gives no chance for songs to breath, it's great to hear something that feels that alive and breathing not quantized to hell.
This is real music
Bruno!!! You make me remember Michael Jackson…
😍😍😍😍
지리네
Excellent!
O 🇧🇷 espera por esse show vem para o Rio de Janeiro ❤️😍
They real enjoy in the music
Never gets old. Even better than the radio version.
💘love 🎵 song
ATTENTION EVERYONE: IM TRYING TO BE BRUNO MARS FOR HALLOWEEN. IF ANYONE KNOWS WHERE I CAN GET A SUIT EXACTLY LIKE THE ONE WORN HERE, I WOULD BE VERY THANKFUL!
My
Brasil curte
sou Brasil love
Он второй после Elvis Presley
This track is so smood ❤️
🤗 just wow
At 66 years old, I've seen hundreds of concerts. My daughter took me to see Bruno. I've never been so entertained! One of the best!
Bruno Mars, Anderson and the rest of the band work very well together the music they’re creating is amazing!!!!!!!
Bruno Mars il n'y a rien à dire on est tous fiers de lui
Me gust😍.....
Love this song & well done.
Once you've seen Prince and Michael Jackson you have seen the best. These 2 are just average in comparison
Essa música me lembra a pandemia
Enkosi uphazamise
Best duo I've seen in a long long time,  very compatible vocals 🙌 and can listen to them forever😍❤❤❤
Veo este tema y quedo perplejo del talento de Bruno Mars y su banda, quedo sin palabras 😨👏👏 Lo escucho y tiene una mezcla de temas ochenteros estilo Michael Jackson, los Jackson Five y Stevie Wonder juntos 🙂 ...  Solo decir, que es un genio de la Musica de hoy en dia 👏👏👏🇨🇱🇨🇱
Perfection. WOW.
This is old school for sure. We had so many artists back in the day with this sound yet each had their own distinctive vocals. We need more of this type music today, because these days it’s more junk than actual real artists that can actually sing. And rapp (crappy) is the worst. Seeing these fools walking around on stage holding themselves and talking fast. SO BORING.😂
Love Anderson Pak ❤️
So talented
Damn !! Wow !! Ain't no topping that one for a while !! 👍👍👍😎😎

SOOOO GOOOOOODD! Ughh
Life is a journey, a story telling, The living of a soul, we are born and little by little we find ourselves. Between falls and conquests, we learn next...  Life is like a comic book... Some are reading, while others are watching, what are you doing...  The good thing about life is that even if we can't change, what was left behind, it gives us the opportunity, to write a new story...  Life has sounds, that for us to hear, need to learn to start over. It's like playing the same guitar, and in it compose a new song...  Music and videos always very beautiful, and emotionally selected...  The more mature, and conscious we become, The best and most accurate are our choices...  Show!... An Excellent Video and A Beautiful Music. Beautiful Edition. Congratulations. A Nice Post. It cost!... Big hug. Beautiful Afternoon and a Beautiful Beginning of the Week... (H.R.)💯⭐☀⭐🌟
Bruno Mars will always be the best singer for me. 😭😭😭
This song is a MASTERPIECE!! I'm a Metalhead at heart, but this song just tugs at your heart! And I love the old school vibe!
Old school sounds loving it!
https://youtu.be/-p_qcBDPs6Y
I'm almost certain they rented those outfits from some of my boomer relatives, who haven't declutter their closets since the disco days. LoL
Díky Brunovi je zpátky hlavně ať Bruno Mars je furt svuj

👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
This song, this album never gonna get old to me. I love it.
🔥🔥🔥
I love this song when I'm driving in my car I play it over and over again can't stop listening to it this my jam
This is giving me Vibes of the temptations, the delfonics, and every Motown, and  Stax music group of the sixties and seventies .
This is why Bruno Mars  appeals to the older generation as well as the younger age groups.
I had that same outfit in the 70’s!😎🏁😂
Sure  Grammy, best song!!
This is a multi generational lick, not many artistes can achieve that vibe,kudos.
These guys really compliment each other and blend together as one. Even their solos are seamless harmony. That’s not easy. They are geniuses for getting together and making this beautiful album. I hope they continue to work together.
Song,📻📻📻📻show 🎤🎤🎤🎸🎺🎷🥁🪕🎙🎙🎙🎙
Great .
Que hermosa voz de Bruno Mars

Bruno Mars brings back the oldies! His sound is like listening to music in the 50s or 60s!
I have followed Bruno since he recorded Grenade.
I love, love them.

I don’t have words for the perfection of Bruno’s voice 😍
Paak can just hum a note and I'm hollering 🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️
I love it
They really studied the artform. They show the rich history of that genre and the difficulty, swag and professionalism it takes to make it. It's a great homage without being corny and pushes rnb forward. 💗💞 It's beautiful
Anderson took us to Church on this night!!!!
I shall leave my door open! Love this song!
Nosssssa ✨
Simplesmente amo!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

Thank you for bringing back Real Authentic and timeless music that hits the soul and heart. We need more of this today 😍✨
My door is ALWAYS open for Burno Mars and Silk Sonic🥰
Pure silk sonic.  This is so romantic and sweet.  We need these guys at this moment in time 🥰
I remember a Tavares
Boys, you brighten my life, great song. Xxx
One of the greatest songs for all time - 💯
Anderson Paak CAN sing. He sings his ass off.  But. THERE'S just, "SOMETHING ABOUT" Bruno. His voice "hits differently". Every tune, note, pitch, scale. His persona, character, personality. He's proven this over and over, time and time again. Just, different.
Perfect!!
MONSTER MONSTER THE BEST
You know the one thing I love about this version of the song? That bit of vocal harmony (just the two of them) they do right at the end... you don't find that in any other version of the song I've seen on here so far.
I'm so love with this old school music 🎵 🎶 all day long and all night! Making my toes curl 🤣
Just to think they decir their song and one year later they won their own Grammy for it!!
Parabéns aos envolvidos nessa melodia que é uma verdadeira obra de arte, sinceramente, a mesma deveria se tornar patrimônio tombado Mundial, imagine só um dueto entre os talentosos Bruno Mars e Whitney Houston, rs, quem sabe um dia, em um outro milênio, que Deus abençoe a todos! ♥️🎉👏🏽💫🎙️🎷🎹🎧🎸🥁🎶🚀
Gentleman Music
It's amazing how they really enjoy to sing the song, that make evrybody feel so enjoy too
Congratulations 🎈🎊🎉🍾
Man, Bruno's Vocals is something else man...His fashion, Music.....Name one bad thing about him.. You can't.

Man....what a performance! Undeniable,  such great talent! Makes me  wanna look for my polyester suit, bust out the 33 albums  and dance and romance  my wife, yes sir!
Love how my Mars and Paak are so in sync with the groove they don't need to look at each other to read for cues in order to sing perfectly in sync! Truly the best collab since I can remember, sending the silkiest vibe from my ears, eyes right to my soul!
OK OK OK I’m taking my panties off hold your horses.
3:03 amazing….
Amazing! 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰

70's Teddy Pendergrass vibe
I love you so much ❤️😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
I judst really love Bruno Mars voice...
silk Sonic.  loving the vibe and all the music you are coming out with.  thus song has become a favorite of mine.  4th  impact has done a beautiful cover of it that I can't quit listening too also. the song is great by both  you and them. keep bringing it. oh and if you need to replace either one of your back up singers....I'm your man.
🥰🤗🔥🎶🎤🎶🎶💕
Maravilhoso
Not sure if you got my email about the IPAD a pleasure to meet you and your family a very happy
This is my favorite live vocals of all time…
Amazing.... Amazing.   Magical.   Such talent from actually ALL of the guys. Of course Bruno and Anderson are phenomenal but as a group this is so masterful  on ALL levels.. choreography, musianship, vocals, arrangement  is off the chart. I can't  stop listening to this...and SKATE.. and FLY as Me.  And all this new album.   I am screaming like I am in an audience. !!!!!!!!
I love this sound, Im so Old School, I love this sound...Takes me back! Slow jams...
TO J....
This is good
😍😍🤩
Buena música... Super❤️
me fez lembrar os anos 90
É tão lindo que não me canso de ouvir!!!!
Hace rato ya que Bruno Mars venía incursionando en música retro setentera y disco que lanzaba era un éxito pero ahora que se unió a este grupo simplemente son una bomba. Ésto me da esperanza de recobrar la buena música.

OMG, no words.
Anderson Paak MY GOD ✨🤩😍❤️
The Jackson Four ????
Everyone talking about Bruno but Anderson Paak is killing on this track literally 👏👏👏🥵
Incredible musicianship! However, this is live like I am republican.
Didn't realize the Manhattans are making new music!!!
Yes, Lawd!!!  God loves. Love.  He gave love to us.  Keep promoting love!!!!  Go Anderson!!!
Old school at its best !!! Bruno takes this to another level !!! I appreciate his musical talent so much and now he's teamed up with Silk Sonic and takes us back to what could have been a lost musical era. Singing songs like this brings that musical Era back and I love and appreciate the fact that they sing it and brings it right to your soul !!!Thank you guys!!!
Shit sarap😊😁
Bitch we not from 63rd
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I love Bruno Mars and silk sonic is kool and they're talented but I cant take them!!!! seriously for some reason

"R&B" singers out here trying to sound like pop singers while Bruno and Paak are killing it with the old school 70-80's sound.
Remind me of the Dramatics, old school 70s R&B

Wow!!! I know you guys hit Gold how beautiful ❤️ Remember you must keep God in your steps. Many are out to tear you down so keep a ring of prayer around you! Much love keep blowing up your music has perfect class🤗💥💯🌟♥️
This is real sour stirring singing, I love SS & so glad that they formed a group bc they are filling the need for romantic songs that is overlooked today. One thing that I would like to see though is let the other two background singers have a chance to have songs where they take the lead & showcase their talent too just like Envogue it just seems more fair & it adds the unexpected intrigue anticipation
awesome I don't know who they are but they are awesome
Oo se pasaron muy buenos  .. es volver a los 80 i love you
I love this performance!
God bless u, He loves u ^-^ Dios los bendiga, Él los ama ^-^
I'm a 63 year old grandmother and I don't really listen to or like today's music, I prefer Gospel music, but I am slowly becoming a fan of Silk Sonic. I love singing and hearing the voices of those who are gifted with singing and that sound good. I also love the 70's and old school R&B. These brothers can sing.
smooth as silk.

Gracias Bruno por salvar la música una vez mas¡¡¡¡
I don't know about ya'll but their performance at the Billboard Awards. OMG!!! Please continue this for the generation that remember actually instruments being played on stage. So Andy makes me think about the guy in the Bar Kay's. Just a thought. Lol. Anticipation. 😆 🤣 😂.
These are real performances what they doing right now and the quality of music they release I never thought I'd hear again.. much respect by
LETS NOT GET IT TWISTED...ANDERSON YOU CAN SEE THE INFLUENCE AND LISTEN TO THE DRUMS CAUSE THAT IS ANDERSON.

PERFECT! 20220521.w7
https://youtu.be/CevxZvSJLk8
Who tells a woman to “shut her trap”? Has Bruno Mars got Covid-19? Does he not realise that he is more important than any Dan, Daniel, Nikau, CardiB, ANZ, Hamilton, Scott, Jason, Robin Thicke, Santa Monica Drive, Hoofs and Skates?

ANDERSOOOOOOOONNNNNN AAAAGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHH OH BABY DONT KEEP ME WAİTİNG
My beautiful boy
This is music.
One of the best out there with the old style and the new sounds. They are all around entertainers and all are equally talented.
Fuck that
I’m a big fan of Bruno Mars since “Just the way you are” I listen to his music at work, car and gym… I finally had a chance to watch them live last 5/6/22 in Vegas and that concert was phenomenal.  It’s a must see concert!!! If I wasn’t too far from Vegas, I would watch it again.
Bruno mars is amorzinho 😍😍😍
He is looking more and more like Sammy DavisJr with every passing year
Loveit live
Put love and romance back in my, one away from,70 year old mind, body and all that
so... did they just watch a video and called it LIVE?
I love Bruno Mars this is Martha benavides from Albuquerque New Mexico the land of enchantment love their music love it love it love it and I'm 61 years old
This is the type of great music I grew up with in the 80s and 90s .
IT'S BEEN 1 YEAR ALREADY?!
Anderson Park and Bruno Mars are so talented. They brought back memories for me when I was care free and young. A much better time. My hats off to Silk Sonic.
¡I LOVE R&B!
This is Magic, si awesome
Yass ! Please

I see they are bringing back the 1970s look. I love it.
Backup singer's ain't no joke either.......fantastic group
So legendary
If you were to run this through some vintage filter, and tell me that you ripped this off of a Betamax from 1977, I'd believe you.
I get that Wow pause listening to this!
00:13
Nicely! I love the duo!!   #GodblessNigeria
This is simply wonderful! Real music!
Flawless!
Que música, que interpretação,difícil é parar de escutar 😍
who is the guy introducing them?
Amei! Queria vê-lo camtar só pra mim. Love Bruno😍
歌声にうっとり💖
Different no
I play this song over and over and over,  just can't get enough, love it!💕
O loved vintage music..
With this Style........You're in the pockets of old school ! Congratulations on nailing This Fan Base!😉
See, they know they killin' it.  That old school baby making vibe.
I despise overly manufactured pop music from fake artists like Taylor Swift and Billie Eillish, but Bruno has always given me faith that there still are genuine artists out there.
The vocals omg
Well deserved song of the year. A future classic for sure.
Yeahh.. favorit song!
Your love is a heavenly gift!
ESTILO JACKSON FIVE!
then after a year, this song BAGGED ALL THE AWARDS IN 64TH GRAMMYS AWARD. IT DESERVED.
I don't listen to Bruno Mars anymore. I like him with the Hooligans they jamed.

the dances are the best there is
0:55 that spin
Te amo 🥳🤩🥳😝😋🤩😍🤩
Excelentes cantantes, me encanta la música de Bruno Mars. 🎤🎹🎸🎶🎵🎼
Why is Anderson giving David Ruffin
𝗥𝘂𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗮-𝗨𝗸𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗲 𝗪𝗮𝗿: 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗣𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗼𝗿𝗮 𝗕𝗼𝘅 𝗶𝘀 𝗢𝗽𝗲𝗻 The ramifications of this war run much deeper than the impact it will cause to those directly involved in the conflict. It will reshape the world, as it is likely that other latent frictions between countries and territories will be activated as a consequence of the Russia-Ukraine situation. This war just opened an era of wars, small and large, between different peoples. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson recently said that this war could easily become "the biggest war in Europe since 1945", and I agree. If countries with similar backgrounds cannot reach agreement between them, then how much more likely it is that several countries that have big differences and ancient conflicts may easily slip into war for no apparent justifiable reason. On a personal level, it saddens me to see how fate turns around and once again we find ourselves at war. I am sorry and restless since I have many students in Russia and Ukraine who are under threat and feel how the deteriorating situation is affecting them and the whole world. In Israel, too, I have many students who follow with concern what is happening in Eastern Europe, anxious about the fate of their family members and friends. My hope is that the manifestations of hatred between the Russians and the Ukrainians will stop soon, two peoples who have lived side by side throughout history. If it were still possible, I would give everything I could to silence, calm down, avoid the escalation, but this is impossible for now.  There is not much that we can do at this stage. We can only long for peace and a ceasefire, talk about all parties showing restraint. The parties in conflict could follow the example of the Native American tribes who buried their hostility in a ceremony during which previously warring tribes agreed to settle their differences and live in harmony, and sealed their agreement by the chief of each tribe burying a war hatchet in the ground.  Such a scenario does not look realistic under the current circumstances. Thus, above the forces of hostility, above the egoism and control as the driving forces of all the conflicts in the world, we can only raise a global prayer for peace, asking that we all get along with everyone. Because only in the power of connection and in the connection between our hearts, can a great positive force arise, a force that is able to unite all parties, to reconcile the haters, to awaken the truth in us all that we all belong to one soul. As it is written, “He who makes peace in His heights, may He make peace upon us…” (The Book of Job, 25:2)
Love the fact that they are each other’s back up singers! The transition is so smooth…

Hermoso dios mío ♥️🥰🧚🏻

Bruno….Bruno…. You NEVER FAILED to Impress me.  When you started singing everything comes to life‼️❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Nightfam accent intro.
Those who accidentally read my comments, I pray that their life goes smoothly, their goals are quickly achieved, and always healthy
1970s styles of song  The clothes  The dance choreography  All are 1970s styles
It's like I'm re-living my teenage years from the 80s once more :-)  Thank you so much Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak.  Bruno is one of those artists that you can just see how much he loves his craft which is why his music is so good!
love this
i love this
This so smooth, Goodness! A live performance 🤯 I feel like I just ate some really good chocolate.
Oh Bruno, Silk Sonic X BTS, pretty please. 🙏💜💜
I am going to leave my door open for you 💋💖
Bruno Mars the best songs.
How about a collab with H.E.R and OLIVIA RODRIGO?
Tom Lewis 1946-2016
the guys from Fortnite
Got the vibe and keepin it on..
I thought this was the official video when I was watching forgot about the intro
Got to give it to Bruno, he’s the best re-inventor of old genre EVER. He knows why it was good, captures everything from the era. Can’t wait to see what’s next.
Top notch! Harmonies faultless n spectacular. Great uniforms/suits. Loved the performance
Grabe ka Bruno Mars!!! Huhu napakagaling
Bruno mars👍💕💕💕💕💕❤️
Wow...What else is there to say? LOVE!
...cassette on my back pocket.
Not to be off subject but they sorta remind me of The Temptations .  I loveee me some Bruno Mars .
They are killer ✨🔥
So good. ❤👍
I didn't know Bruno Mars could sing this high, what an amazing voice. Everytime I heard this song in the radio I thought for a second it was Michael Jackson
bruno mars is the 'new' eugene carter!!!
Now that they've brought back classic R&B and Doo Wop, it's time for them to drop at least Disco track.
When I watch Anderson I get flashbacks of the late greats: Bobby Womack, and David Ruffin. Bruno reminds me of Bobby DeBarge with his energy.
I like how bruno giving other artist their moment...all his collaborations with other artist are all good music..
I love bruno mars high note s
That is what music is all about..🎼🎤❤️❤️👏🏼👏🏼🥰🥰
Wow...... Bruno..... sounds great.
Gils sih. Lagunya di nyanyiin taon kemaren taon ini bisa menang.
Absolute perfection! Bruno please lose the mustache.
Damn!, That's so Good stuff right there'....Beautiful Music!
best thing about bruno is how his voice like fades
What music used to be amazing thank you🎵
This performance knocked me out straight fire🔥🔥🔥...
so 70s and so beautiful! thank you for bringing back this soulful sound
They're amazing!!!!
A definite raw talent and loving the 70s vibe! I miss this era!
This is live right!?
Legendary💃💃💃💃💃💃
Bruno is such a sexy smooth operator,I love this handsome fellow!!
That is that Libra Aquarius magic!
I love this song and seeing this just made me love it even more
Yes Yes ❤️
Wow desde que la escuche no paro de repetirlo me encanta!!
These boys are gonna bring  the 'grown folks' out to play 😊
👍
I like their 70s style .  👍👌👏
Song of the year!🏆🏆🏆
Was Waiting for Bruno Mars and he Came Back like What!? Anderson Paak and Bruno was Definitely Divine Destiny
The BEST Collaboration EVER since Michael Jackson and Quincy Jones
70's Soul Train vibes
Oh meu Deus do céu! Que música mais linda! Parece que eu estou vivendo a época de ouro da música: época do Jackson Five, Al Green, Bill Withers e Groove Washington Jr ... Bruno é um talento espetacular e extraordinário, quem salva o cenário da música atual! Que primor essa música!
Bruno sexy as heck.  Reminds me of a Pimp in the 70s that captures the attention of any woman because of he's so smooth. Very talented group
So flawless this song give me goose bumps
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Super love it! Very relaxing, calming, great dancing moves and beautiful voice. Congratulations guys!
Omg, This is what you call music, just like the old days, the 60's the way they sang and moved, I love it. Rapping got to go, it's been going on too long, Enough.
Ohhhhhhh myyyyyyyyyy…..uuuummmmmm…….good lord🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
E o cara , canto tradicional muito bom
The 70s vibe is beautiful.  That is just ridiculous.  Isley Bros meets Michael Jackson meets maybe the Tempations.  Listening to that I think these guys could put together what was called an album, back then, in a one take.  And the energy!  There no doubt in my mind it should have been a sweep.
1:45 kill me
Crystal vocals.
Best song I heard these days 👌 👌 Amazing 🥰 Bruno💫
Não canso de ouvir,muito talento junto,incrível !
reminds me of the Stylistics, Dramatics and all the groups of the late 60s and 70s.
The Greatest Music I've heard since the 70 and 80.
Maravilhoso 😁👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Holy Moly is this LIVE!!!!???
Is it weird that I just fell in love because of this song, but not sure with what or whom??? 😭
Great song Silk Sonic, Bruno Mars awesome the best since MJ left us.
Love this song.  It is so smooth and perfect!
Wow! the Sound of the 70's - takes me completely back to all those fabulous groups with their tight harmonies and REAL singing. These guys did their homework! Motown was wonderful and paved the way with the Temps and Smoky and the Miracles and Four Tops, etc but when the 70's hit and Gamble and Huff came on the scene in a big way it was lights out!  Bravo Bruno and Anderson!!
Bilion....likes!!!
Wonderful Music...wonderful artists!
“That’s what I like” (literally, at least the verse is)
I love it. It's a hit!!! Txema.
Wow amazing ...bruno mars going....
Would love to hear you sing a Teddy Pendergrass song um um
LOVE IT!!!🙏❤❤❤
Amazing voices ❤   ever
This man so fine  bruno be mine
Perfection exists ❤️❤️
I LOVE THIS SONG... NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES I HEAR IT OR WATCH THE VIDEO.THE SAME THOUGHT POPS IN MY HEAD. I LOVE THIS SONG 💓❤️💓❤️💯
And there it goes. RECORD and SONG OF THE YEAR!
Shamone over ❤️
The harmony is exceptional here.  Bruno always Brings It, always has.  What's not to Love?
Grown Men who still can not figure out how to write thought provoking lyrics. They are adult's singing songs for high school girl's, it's pathetic.
Its like Earth wind and Fire!!!
2:23     3:01
Lawd who knew we needed this performance😍😍😍😍
Esses dois, incluindo o grupo todo é simplesmente perfeito e maravilhoso e demais, muito muito muito muito inspiradoressssss!
My song of the year
New and improved Morris day and Jerome vibe am getting
WoW !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Shamon!
Watched this numerous times over the past year. Never gets old! ❣️
Luv Bruno’s voice.
0le school with a twist.
"Bringing Sexy Back" baby #ThankYou 💋💃🏾🤺.
Love just love the music of Mars and Anderson "Silk Sonic". Marvin Gay. Luther Vandros...This is real music of lyrics people can relate to. Continue please!
Bruno Mars, Anderson Paak are the best artists!!!!!
Class
このアーティストが凄いから、カバーするあとに続く歌い手も凄い事になったんでしょうね。😊究極のハーモニー‼️
Bruno Mars is cold by himself, now he and Anderson will be a powerhouse. Them boys are cold!!! Silk Sonic!
Ma man Anderson is killing it. I never would have expected him to drop full swag tune on @1:40. Whatever smoke he was having, I want some of it.
Damn what happened to music like this for real though
Anyone else prefer this ending then the orginal.
This is generational music. Well deserved success.
Love Bruno and Silk Sonic💕 Music made for the children of the 70’s.  Thank you for keeping this style of music relevant♥️
Just wow
Bruno Mars is the lead singer and nobody can match his voice. Anderson is good but nobody is as good as Bruno - so he should always be the lead. Nice duet though.
They’re actually singing. Real artists.         👏👏👏👏
Eu sou o comentário "PORTUGUÊS" Que você procura kkk😊
amo amo amo amo amo amo amo amo
"BRUNO KEEPS IT REAL!" This is nothing but "break it down" CLASSIC R&B! Silk Sonic is amazing! Is Bruno Mars the successor to the Michael Jackson "throne?"
Their live performances are phenomenal. I wish they could release a live performance DVD, it would be a beautiful keepsake
Can't stop playing SilkSonic.. Every song gives me chills. Love Bruno and Anderson together. They are a match made in Heaven 🔥🔥🔥🥰🥰🥰
Você é bom no que faz, parabéns
The 1970s revived. Just brilliant 👏
This just shows that this sound is  timeless, no matter what era of music  🔥🔥🔥
😍
Necesito ánimo y fuerzas y energía ánimo mi gente hermosa vamos con energía vamos con todo mi gente hermosa vamos Youtube y Google excelente introduciendo la información del coronavirus y Youtube mejor y maps gratis en Youtube mi gente hermosa vamos Youtube
Love u Bruno Mars
LOVE him and the music! !
Muito bom
This....OMG..LOVE IT..LOVE ITTTT..
Anderson 😍😍😍
Way too perfect
That 'leave the door OPEN' so smooth 1:07
I’m not over how GOOD Anderson is. Like he’s always been a sick drummer, producer, writer, but he’s legit singing on this track. REAL singers hear and know that he’s not just holding a note, this man is SINGING.
Ok so is it just me that got CHILLS at the very beginning when Anderson sang “my house clean, pool warm…”
Congratulations on winning all your grammy nominations 👏😍 well deserved 👏😍
😭💜
Damn now that's how music should be.
Idk how but this performance for me is better than the actual version. The ending was really well thought through

Really like the improvs. Both are cool and talented in their own ways.
""Wow!!! Much 💘 Love!  Old school Vibes😍😊
If "Born to do Thisssss" was two people... Bruno and Anderson are definitely it! They told every other artist on this planet, Sit Down... and watch how it's done!
Way to bring it back Bruno! Loving it! Thank you!!
I'm 56 and straight oldies. But they did a great job  All the old heads will pass your the prince crown.
Great job bringing back the 80s here 🥰
Bruno mars è bravissimo,sembri sia in playback ma non è cosi
What a vocals! Don't talk about Bruno when it comes to winning Grammy
What a performance!!!!!   ME = SOGGY UNDIES!  DIPPED In GOLD! Wow!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I just recently heard this song.  They’re truly amazing singers/performers.  This style takes me back to the groups of the 50s 60s 70s and even 80s. 🎶  Listen to this:  https://youtu.be/bp3pVlWGxqw And this: https://youtu.be/oM7QN5OkUMA

Reminds me the old times 😊😊
Congrats silk sonic. You guys are amazing. Grammy winners. Maybe another Michael Jackson superstar
Bruno is as cute as a button. Reminds me of the old school groups like The Dramatics. Talented young men. Those melodies are on point. That harmonious wrap up is the bomb. Smoking up the windows too please.
Minute 03:21...that high note gave me goosebumps!!!
OMG sounds so classic! Romantic 60's style is back with this song.
i love the choreo😆🔥
Now we have 2022 and how we call it? A clean sweep at the Grammys
No that's R&B, Great tribute to groups like The Dells, Dramatics, Chi-Lites, O'jays, and many others who paved the way. For Silk Sonic******* Pure Perfection! Lights Out.
Now THIS is music!!  Wow, I was so hoping today's artists would capture what music used to be....thank you!!
So this song debuted last years Grammys and now this year Grammy's it bagged all awards? Wow! Like unbelievable! This duo is iconic!
Definitely here for it!!! 😍❤️
Bruno Mars is so hot and he can sure sing ! Never heard of Anderson Peak until now and he’s pretty good too xD #silksonic
🔥
Bruno have one of the best voices in the century.
Relp !!!!!!.
I Love him so much ,his music is so incredibly inspiring to me ❤️
2:09 voicecrack :>

Anderson Paak is so smooth
Y’all killed that performance !
앤더슨 팩과 브루노의 환상적인 콜라보레이션 세계 최고의 노래와 춤은 소울이 느껴집니다 ❤
Yeah, but tell the story of how Ringo3000 got kicked out of the band because they just needed a fourth for tours.
Eu voo c está música coisa tão angelical🥰🤩🕺💃🔝🔝🔝🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶👏👏
Perfect song. This goes up there with the classics of the 70’s and 80’s.

YESSS SIR! That's what I'm talking about!
Este tipo es el mejor del mundo, me recuerda tanto a Michael Jackson y es como ver que MJ esta reencarnado en Bruno. Wao!
This is THE PERFORMANCE!
Stylistic of the next generation. Clean and smooth.
How good is Bruno?
Bruno was born to sing and be a performer hands down 💯 percent in everything he does. BEAUTIFUL Silk Sonic absolutely love it 💜🤩
TIMELESS
GENIUS!!! Thank You!!
Song of the Year babyyy!!!
Such an easy romantic fun and addicting song… I leave my door open 🤩….
Vibes for days.............
Bruno Mars can SANG
The song had debut stage at Grammy 2021 and clean swept the Award 1 year later. What a song!
From debuting at 2021 Grammys to winning so many Grammys in 2022. Simply amazing.. Congrats Silk Sonic!
It's fucking chilllll. I got goosebump ven from the first note!!!!!!!
bruno's voice omgggg, silk is so good too!!
Congratulations to Bruno Mars and silk sonic for winning the Grammy for record and song 🎵 of the year for the 2022 Grammys. We hope you will keep your promise sing this jam the rest of your lives
finally you can find some good music in the actual sea of shit that "music" become...
Love the 70s vibez
Cool sound, nothing new that ain't old here, straight up Philly Sound lift, if you like this try some Stylistics, they did this on 50 year back.
LOVE THIS MUSIC....
They’re a tonic
Lalalalala amo realmente esta canción!!!! 💞💞💞❤️💫💫💫
From performing at the Grammys to sweeping the Grammys!
Awesome… So full of passion and soul  BLM
Pure 70's vibe and style!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93vMesitdFo
Suis hyper fan❤️🔥
I like both Anderson Paak and Bruno Mars  equally but it seems that people only acknowledge Bruno. I love listening to both of them and yes they are definitely SILK❤️💯 Also respect to the background singers👍🏽🙏🏽❤️
Wow we went back to the 70's
The they remind me of The Four Tops and The Temptations. The glory days of R&B have been resurrected. This is the music I used to listen to in the '70s.
Bro they got no right sounding this good live!
Phenomenal performance 💖
Essa música é linda demais 💙
I am reliving the late 60s early 70s when you could actually listen to music and feel it.  So retro....so great keep it up
Smooth and so gorgeous. Great intro lyrics - I look too good to be alone!
1:40 smoke
ماحبيتها😕
You deserved every bit and every lyrics of these song. I love you both. Included you both for what I wished for you to be safe and happy. Love you both so much.
It's Chilling! The Sound, Vibe and moves bring me back to "the Temptations".
This isn’t music. This is magic.
amazing song and performance
this is incredible
Love love Bruno Mars. He’s incredible talent.
Lovin the 70"s all over again!   Motown and soul sounds, like the oldies😃😃😃
those hand gestures when they won GRAMMY 2022 😂😅😅😆
Delfonics re-created. Fabulous!
Bruno’s voice is a slice of heaven. Congrats to Silk Sonic on their Grammy win last night.
O melhor cantor do mundo , incríveis performances. 😍😍😍
This was a great performance. There is something to be said about doing covers of popular songs from the 70s, which were not awarded due to racism, getting awards now. Should those other albums and arrangements get recognition now? Interesting thought
Smooth as Silk..
Ik word helemaal gek onwys ik ben weer jong dans  de héle  dag w1at een hit super dank je wel ik ben zo bly van deze hit 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
Been done before.
What a great tribute to the old Motown music.  I'd love to see more music like this.
Great retro sound and appearance. Takes me back to the soul classics perfectly.
Bruno Mars increible!!🎶
Motown revisited 🌼 and that Smokey Robinson sound at the end 🎤
Legends to Jackson 5 calibre. They are amazing
Congratulations on winning the Record of the Year
Just love, love, love this retro 70’s style music.  My era, my heart.  SilkSonic rocks. 💖
that was 1 year ago performance and today they won the song of the year from grammys wow
straight out the 1970's
💕💕
Try The Isley Brothers, "Living for the love of you" to see the real masters at work. Nothing beats old school. Then try "Voyage to Atlantis".
Beautiful song
Im team driver’s license but they super deserve song of the year!!!
Love this style, brings me back to the past..😎 What a great song like always from Bruno Mars!😂👍
they really went from performing this song for the first time to winning it
Earth, Wind, Fire and Silk.
Amazing, beautiful vocals; amazing musical arrangement!
Congrats on your win!!!!! Legend!!!!
Bruno style is on another level and I love it 🥰
Congratulations on your GRAMMYS!! Very deserving!!🥳🥳🎤🎼🏆🏆❤
This is song is excellent, it’s a instant classic!

Another reason to love Bruno Mars! No wonder they’re called Silk Sonic. This is as smooth and beautiful as it gets! Congrats guys! Love it!!
Is there any song that Bruno Mars does that isn't good!!!   Bruno is AMAZING!!!
Old school I can dig it.
80s vibe is alive in the 2000’s

Oh song was beautiful if I coulf get over LEAVING MY DOOR OPEN WITHOUT BEING HURT OR KILLED.
That's swag ❣️
Classy. So much better than all the trash music of this generation. Thank you for the great work.

Ça c'est la perfection musical.
I love you
Bruno paying homage to Ol skool. The outfits. The streps. Two lead singers. Temps. Dells. Tops.
🤢
Bruno Mars, você é perfeito , e nos faz muito bem. Sinto muita a falta de Michael Jackson, porém você consegue nos confortar com suas músicas . E vc é o novo Michael Jackson. Tão bom quanto a ele
The best I have ever heard from Bruno!  The chills were from the blend and harmony of the old school sound. Voices so tight, perfect !
That ending…OMG!
TODOS LINDOS E MARAVILHOSOS!
This song & performance is timeless!! It almost seem Motown-ish!! Wow!!
Christian das ist unser Lied ❤️❤️Liebe dich so sehr 💕💕💋💋💋💋💕💕💖💖💖💖💞💞💞💞💞💓💓💞
If Silk Sonic does not win a Grammy I will lose all my faith in the music industry.
I'm skeptical of relying too much on nostalgia instead of moving forward creatively but, damn, this hits a bullseye somewhere inside. Perhaps we need more of this.
Can we appreciate the fact that bruno always wears the same outfit as the rest of the band despite being the most famous, you don't see that in alot of band nowadays. Especially in Kpop,  the singers are always with the expensive suits and the musicians aren't even acknowledged.
😭😭😭😭💔💔💔
Omg how?
I got hearted by Bruno mars
Purple Haze is song of Jimi Hendrix
Treasure 2.0. Good as hell, 80's looking, i love it.
brilliant..... reminds me so much of motown love this type of music
Meu tempo💓💕💕💓
I’m not a Bruno Mars fan. However, I LOVE this song! It’s hot as hell!
I like Kamron Whalum

The music, the singers, silk sonic and OH MY FREAKIN GHAAAADD, BRUNO?! Gosssssshh they're just  so so sexy. This is the kind of song that makes you wanna make love to somebody 🥴😅 SUPERB!!
Anderson really killed it this performance
Excellent .
A 1.24 segundos ele faz o impossivel com a voz
Sera que surge uma cansao mais perfeita que esta ?
Well choreographed performance, and the singing sounds just like on the record
i live the door open.. lalal.. lalala.. lala.. nice line.

I'm here after watching Silk Sonic concert at Dolby Live in Las Vegas this weekend

Genial! Me encanta este tema  y la dulce voz de Bruno Mars!! 💖❤❤💜
Whoo!😚😚
I want them to perform in next year's half time show of the superbowl!!!
There is nobody in the Universe like them. They are beyond magic. Absolutely gobsmackingly skilled, talented, and nobody in the current music scene comes  remotely close.
one year anniversary of this IMMACULATE song
I Love BRUNO MARS I Could Listen To BRUNO MARS All Day 😍❤❤❤😘
The harmony at the end got me pregnant! :)
Viajo com essa requebradinha do Bruno
I'm really liking this group. I've heard a lot of their songs... The sound feels like a blend of so many different groups like con function, EWF, Michael Jackson. With silk Sonic's delivery and artistic touch it feels like it could go on forever
SMOOTH 👌
Justine Bieber left the building
Homeboy Bruno Mars
Bruno mars es talentoso es el rescate de esta generacion
Perfect 🤎
Dang, this song does something to me
A song full of 💞 with little sexy, juicy n naughty...... Just make me smile.
i swear to god after 3:30 is like i am hearing R.Kelly and Stevie Wonder....this is truly a masterpiece
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Wow..this visuals.. perfectly just like in my head 😍😍😍
Damn, Bruno Mars really is a legend
So so good. Enjoying this all the way from Sydney Australia..
Motown classic style
I'm on my  sixties and this velvet soulfull melody took me back to the year 1973; when I saw The Stylistics for the first time, been a teenager. This song made me feel young at heart for a while. It was a piece of heaven on Earth!
3:44 Little bit of Blast Off sneaking into the Grammys Performance, catch that?
Mar 2022 still  a groove.  https://youtu.be/Rw61KLnIPCA - (Silk Sonic - Leave The Door Open ) MASHUP SONG COVER
Maravilhosa esta música belíssima
This is the graetest song. .❤💙
0:54 the transition was so frickin smooth
THIS IS THE REAL ART
great!
it looks simple but it's really hard to sing this song.
Now that a song for sure love it. These two are great together
Canta muuuuuito
<3
I first  I thought it was just me. I'm glad to see so many more wonderful people agree with me this is one of greatest songs 🎵 ever. I press repeat at 20 times my thinks I'm obsessed.  🤔
amazing with good headphones!
Bruno is soul music personified 🎵💜
Watch the Newest hit from Adele feat Bruno Mars  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAZvjGkEMxg&list=RDxAZvjGkEMxg&start_radio=1
Easy on the ears
Eu adoro suas músicas vocês são demais!!
Nice, I am listening this song and I enjoy this masterpiece! I love your clothes
Excellent.
OMG!! Amazing !!
He is good😆👍️
ブルーノ・マーズ最高😍
Ele mereçiam Grammy mesmo!Bruno Mars é muito talento assim como Anderson Paak!
Listening to this in 2022....and loving it as much as I would have in the 70s
Awww yea good music i knew you are good in a duo love the music let it be in the air all the music so make it true i know you can do it so make it more then it ever is
Late 60s early 70s sound a time when music was music. They had to be able to sing not coverd up by instruments.
No auto tune
so beautiful!
Esa Voz 💎🎶 Los Mejores!💯💯
Bruno's the man I like your style good classic R&B
My wife has been a Bruno Mars fan for awhile. I was just looking to see when he will perform next and discovered that he is in this band Silk Sonic. So we are going to see them for her birthday. In our backyard here in Las Vegas. I have been listening to this album and its great.
Который несёт собой добро как Майкл Джексон
Афраамереканская  музыка это сердце БОГА
ฉันรักมัน ตามมาจาก tiktok❤❤❤
4m 16s of perfection.
What is your zip code
LINDOS ❤❤🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷👍
Fofos por di mais
I'm very disappointed with him thinking he needs to go in that direction
I really loved him because he was a beautiful singer and he doesn't need to use words like that
I was born mid 50s. Went thru 70s music. The best. But have to say Bruno Mars makes 2022 incredible. I looped it. My fav song.
Iindo,muito sucesso.....
Bruno mars always gives 100%
I did  some research  on Bruno Mars  and  he loved to perform as a kid,Elvis Presley Michael Jackson, so... He  did too  you can  tell. Anderson  Paak  Bringing  greatness to the table with  greatness Bruno Mars Love you both. No smoking, Nodrugs,,Very little drinking . That's the downfall. I want you two to have a long,long career  together ❤  making  good  Soulful music.. It's  that exciting.. You two don't  know what you've  got.
Los quiero
Que chido bruno
Such a bad ass song. Damn these dudes got the sauce right on this one 😁
Lalalalalalallalalllllalaaaa

Masterpiece!
To be honest my little 10 year old wanted me  to hear it, never heard  it before and fell in love  with  the  sound.  He got it from fortnite and he  wanted  B Mars, and A Paak  skins.
You two need never be jealous of each other.Stay together ❤  You are the bomb.That music ,Your choreography  is  dynamite. Where did you two come from.  I love  Skate and I'm leave the door open. Awesome job  background  singers too.
Como me encantas bruno lpm
Bruno mars é muito brabo. Gostei também do Anderson Paak.

This is the type of great music I grew up with in the 80s and 90s .
Segway., where's it at?
God loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life.  If you were to die this very second,  do you know beyond a shadow of doubt,  that you would make it to heaven? The Bible reads for all have sinned and come short of the Glory of God and for the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. The Bible also reads, FOR WHOSOEVER SHALL CALL UPON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED. And we are all whosoevers.  If you would like to receive this gift that God has for you today, please say this after me with your heart and lips out loud. Say,  Dear Lord Jesus,  come into my heart, forgive me of my sins. Wash me and cleanse me.  Set me free. Jesus thank You that You died for me.  I believe that You are risen from the dead and that You're coming back again for me. Fill me with the Holy Spirit. Give me a passion for the lost,  a hunger for the things of God and a holy boldness to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ. I'm saved.  I'm born again.  I'm forgiven and I'm on my way to Heaven because I have Jesus in my heart. Amen. (please like or comment if you said the prayer)
OMG!!!! They Dope Asf!!!!!!!! They brought something back that’s powerful!!!!!! Real Music!!!

We have many doors and you always welcome, if knock my door and it close have other door might welcome to say hello! Our door might be different to see because 7 door but our door knobs are same because same colors. If sees the doors always have plenty all kinds of shoes Infront it our door. Even sometimes you can see other shoes might have poop under it's but that's okay with us because when we are young we act young but when we grow old, we act old and used diaper again, but not same thinking! Hmmmmmm!
So this https://youtu.be/MHKjFH6dk6Y is what happened........
Bruno is back! 👌
Love these two!!!! Bruno’s singing just hits me to my core. What a Beautiful talent he has. Anderson Paak is new to me but I absolutely Love every song I’ve heard them sing together. This was meant to be. Stay humble you two. Much success to you for many years to come.

Best Of Luck and best song and video since the 60s and 70s
Brilliant i love this song 🎵
This song has everything — beautiful melody, lyrics that make me smile everytime, attitude, and Bruno Mars & Anderson Paak. I’m obsessed!
It reminds me of Jackson 5 back in the 70s
Yessssss
With your voice Bruno Mars I conquer the world 🌏🌍
Bruno is the star ⭐️
YOU ARE TRULY A STAR,  HAVE MY 5 WORDS THEY ARE MY BOND
it reminds me of the 70's Soul Train artists like The Intruders for instance, fantastic...
Dammmn! Bruno is a fine m/f.
Love Anderson Paak
Love the 70's vibe.  Brings back great memories of the house party's ,slow dancing growing up Chicago
Nice!💯😍🔥🔥
Perfeito
Very nice
Mekata
Que linda música!!!!!
I'm simply in love
Their moves are perfect what a performance
Performance of the year so good
The vocals are perfectly blend ... I so love it
What a jam! Reminds me of the Old School groups of the 60's, 70's, 80's and 90's. They even look, dress, and perform like the Masters of the past! This is my favorite new song.
That harmony when they sing 'throoooough'. och, it's just 😙🤌
I never get tired of this song
how I tell him Im the girl he's looking for😟
Love it
Apaixonada por essa música 🎶
musica? é uma obra de arte
Das ist so eine wunderbare Musik. Ich komme aus dem Schwärmen nicht mehr raus...Danke an meinen Sohn und seine Freundin, die mir die CD zu Weihnachten geschenkt haben.
I love this song it just make you feel so good when you're feeling down and the song where he sings she got her kids running around my house like it's Chuck e cheese I love that I just laugh
Perfect...just perfect🌟
Bruno came along way wishing he became a billionaire so fckin' bad
I will never forget I watched this on tv wow
Dueto perfeito.
Great man from the philippines
Smoking outside the window cause I have kids b word.
Súper que barbaridad
Anderson is so amazing, I love you Anderson ❤️

La. Mejor cancion
Silk awesome, introducer tarded
Класс
Excellent
Que hermosa canción y ese ritmo. Gracias por este regalo, esto si es música.
They are killing this 70's vibe. PURE GENIUS for all of the artists, producers, musicians and ANYBODY who had a hand in EVERYTHING related to this from the first idea to the finished product. Probably the best thing I've heard a a long time.
Essa dancinha  no melhor estilo Manhattan. Apaixonada! ❤️
the best live performer imo
Can’t wait to see you in Vegas!!!
Impeccable performance!! This is just jaw-dropping! 😲
3:45 was my favorite.. the harmony was out of this world.
He is only artist that can make classic today ..✨
This could start a new wave of amazing music. Record companies will realise people want to hear this soulful / jazzy type of stuff and not overprocessed pop / grime sh*t all the time
Que lindoooo.
👏👏
Yo tengo casi 60 años y hace rato que no escuchaba una banda de esas muy buenas en lo suyo funk ....muy buen tema
Funky en su máxima expresión... Como en época de mayor apogeo de las grandes bandas afroamericanas del FUNK
Ooh! It's So So So good n love to dance with a lady  😁
Like seriously this song🔥🔥🔥🔥..the gift and talent..wow, just wow🤩
Bruno Mars , gatíssimo! 😍
WOW ~ Bruno brought back the 70’s when music was FINE ~ His vocals are amazing!
Swag,swag ,swag!!!!
Dame them boys r bad!!!!
Pardon Bruno, 😊revisitées en 2021
J achete demain l album Bravo bravo bravo Quel travail, quel feeling Les années  70 revisitées en 2022... Uauuuuu!
Desafinado? Ele não sabe o que é isso
How i love the choreography, it's so perfect with the melody and lyrics of the song.😍😍 Mabuhay from Philippines!!
hi wall done hhahahhaha koke
I think Bruno could be turning into another Prince although there will only ever be one Prince  Bruno is creeping up that ladder.
I need him to keep his hands out of his pocket. lol
Love this❣️
브루노마스 저게 말이되는목소리인가 진짜 신의경지다 보컬로만 보자면 올타임 10에 현재는 원탑이다 그냥
Waaaaa!!!!!ntyou
Similar ,Michael Jackson.
Between John Mayer's Sob Rock bringing the 80's pop/rock sound back, The Midnight bringing retro synth based pop back over the last few years and now Silk Sonic bringing back the Motown/ 70's R&B sound, the industry is FINALLY beginning to slide its head out of its a$$ AND I'M ALL HERE FOR IT. I doubt the person who runs their social media will ever see this comment, but just in case, tell these guys I say THANK YOU for this work because it's NEEDED so badly to counteract the prepackaged bull$h!t the industry releases with the mumble rap, auto tuned bs!
I'm obsessed with this song
Maravilhoso
PERFERCT!
Absolutely brilliant
Now this is music
I love this song💖💯
Jackson lives in him
Wowww😍😍😍
unreal
1974 again? Ok but will going still need The Partidrage Family back too,  Come on get Happy!

It's like a vocal roller coaster
Www, como una plegaria en perfecta armonía, danza color, todo. Excelente
I totally agree - haven’t heard or seen something this good. I’ve been buying the CD to my friends! Share the joy!
this live version is so so much better than the version thats played in radio stations. This version is a bit faster and is more dynamic. The studio version comes off somewhat flat sounding.  Still this song is better than almost everything else on the air waves today
3:02 SO GOOD
Completamente apaixonada nessa música 💓😍
I think I've seen like this before... The Manhattans?
O melhor do mundo. Bruno é incrível.😍
Bruno mars voice hits different with the dance moves! In Love with him!!
The background looks like a magical time warp🥰 my fiance knows if I get a hall pass I'm coming for Paak Anderson🤣 off rip!
Bruno is if Sammy Davis, Jr. & Tom Jones had a son. 🥰😍
https://youtu.be/dtdXC7AOBt8
Old School style feel good music 🎶
Lo mejor 2021  muy bueno 👌
love this song, and the moves puts me back to the Temptations, <3
This is The Oldies FullCircle. It is Timeless. Birthplace of True Love.
Bruno Mars was always a great artist, but I think he reached another level with this song. Same goes for Paak.
Official video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyvcf3AjC0s
Philly Soul mucic I love it song
Very “Stylistics”
Very much like the Stylistics.
Nice!
grammy
SOULFUL BLISSFUL MUSIC THAT BACK IN THE DAY MUSIC NOW
On their stage? Tf? This was recorded.
💜🎶💜
THE WEEKND, WAS THAT YOU AT THE BEGINNING?
Mi Filipino/Boriqua favorito
Reminds me of Jackson 5 and the temptations!
How the in the actual hell do they sound better than they did on the record…
Anderson 😍🤘 love you from 🇪🇬
Up and up
I was looking for this version! Love it.
Bruno his voice.. I mean wtf thats live.. He an Angel
A música do ano venho som pesado venho batidas repetitivas aí vem os cara suave é roubam a sena merecido
1:34 This is when -you have proof they are not lip singing  And where it's better then the acutal music video
Imma leave the door open but like the bar after two the offer is through.
Playing this 24/7. Yes we need more of this.
Não tem nada igual. Vcs são  os melhores. Vcs são brabos. Tem o meu respeito mono.
Hii okay

We're they lovers if yes it's ok because  BRUNO ur the closest  to PRINCE AND MICHAEL  WE WILL EVER HEAR .. THANK YOU  U HAVE LEGENDARY  IN U THANK GOD  FOR UR REINCARNATION 🙏l SEE  U BOTH😇
My daughter's & I love ❤️🥰 this sooo much.. 🎶🎶
I didn't quite know who sung that unique song played on the radio while on the road to & from work. I used not to be fond of love songs when I was young.

Haven't heard music in so long that leaves something to the imagination.. A pleasure to listen to without the profanity, straight baby making music right there. Anderson And Bruno fantastic collaboration.

Quem dera eu conseguice o Whatsapp dele
I love you
Was the intention of this piece to replicate 1970's style ballads, like those done by the O'Jays and Four Tops...
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Que apresentação perfeita
Cheesy racist derivate shit is what this is. I dont get it. Music is dead
3:21 Bruno Mars High Note are really killing me...You are legend Bruno🔥🔥

As much i love kpop, Bruno Mars's song is always superior.
This is a live performance. Other worldly
Reminds me of a young bobby debarge. Much respect young man.
Adoro la coreografía y lo ultra romántica que es..... MARAVILLA 🥰🥰
Bruno sings like an angel!
This song makes me feel like im living in the 80s. Wow . Bravo!!! Totally in love with the arrangements
I ❤️ u Bruno!! Omg your voice is silky, melts me 🥰 just love ya omg
Here because of Agoney's performance in TCMS 😍
Siapa tgk video ni sebab TIRO Sila like
Qué artistazo
It is comforting to see this kind of talent in music today when there is so much garbage being sold and promoted as music and talent when it is anything but. Bravo Bruno, keep at it.
And the next next winner is.......LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN
Tirooo
Combinación perfecta 😍
This is it, right here.  🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Daaaaaaamn!!!!!
Bruno is incredible. I can't get enough of this!! So amazing

They can sing about anything the lyrics is crazy but their confidence pulls it off
These dude got confidence and that's all you need and Bruno just the icing on cake
OMG, the vocals on these men ! Whew !, I would love to see Bruno and Beyoncé do a duet.  That would be a powerful match up
This was hard as hell
Как же круто они спели .Бальзам для ушей.👍

BRUNO MARS CHRISTMAS SONG 2021 ** Christmas is coming and I'm all alone With no one to snuggle at night. My wineglass is empty to help dull desire To kiss you by soft candlelight.  A rare pearl of value, you don't leave alone Or someone will steal them from you. After they've gone and flown far away It's hard to know just what to do.  I'm watching my neighbors hang lights on their tree With tinsel and striped candy cane. I took you for granted and didn't hug enough And now I must suffer my pain.  Lord, I'm so lonely; I wish I could die Then be born to relive again. I realize the value of someone to love And the danger of my selfish sin.  There's a ring on my phone and a knock at the door Which do I dare go for? If neither is you, I'll break down and cry And again pound my fist on the floor.  I run down the hall and the doorknob turns As the swirling snow rides on the wind. There, in my doorway, it's the face I love Such a beautiful present to send.  Now, I am happy and dancing around With a permanent smile on my face. As children are singing their Christmas love songs And the world is a wonderful place.  THANK YOU FOR WHO YOU ARE IN YOUR HEART !

BEST VERSION
Splendid.
Você é um espetáculo, uma obra de Deus, canta muito... essa música é a melhor que já ouvi em  todos os tempos!!!
You guys are amazing ❣️
Looking for the veins in their necks to expand when high or strong notes are sung.
Top D+
This is real masterpiece
This was a Total A List performance and with a complete mastery of the language that connects the World known as music
Outside of Prince and maybe R.Kelly I've hardly ever seen someone perform live and sound better than the recorded version. I'm talking singing in front of a live band, not prerecorded or lip syncing. This is the third video I've seen of this song and they've changed it up every time they've performed it and just keep sounding better while doing it.
Que música foda
I love it <3
❤️❤️❤️
You're the best.
AMAZING !!
Eles são DEMAIS❤️❤️❤️ Bruno 🥺😍 I surrender 🙌🏻
The king of pop☝️🎉
Tuff tuff tuff
veryNice☺️☆ＩLOVEYou。☆JAPAN☺️☆➰👋😃
Delícia vê eles dançando...😍🤩
Absolutely insane!!!!!✊
Bruno's giving me Bobby DeBarge and Sammy Davis, Jr vibes.
From Detroit I grew up on the Motown sound..    So i've been spoiled. But this is one serious groove.
Zero dislike for a 35M views. woaaaahh.
Bruno Mars, que humildade, parabéns, sucesso pra ti e Silk Sonik.
I'm obsessed
My mind just blew 9x
Classic real art musical geniuses ❤❤❤❤
Is that a fucking live??? Damn !!!
ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!!!!!
The next Michael jackson, i love all of his music
Masterpice
Vcs lembram os conjuntos dos anos 70, lindos, maravilhosos, PARABÉNS 🇧🇷
Awesome
Andersons Paaks voice oh my lordy
very good retro
should be an award for best grammy performance buy any band ever...these guys absolutely flawless.....they would win it hands down...i digress..
Bruno es el único cantante capaz de transportarnos a la mejor época de la música soul funky disco   . brillante ,único , genial
That superb synchronised spin at 0:55 (lots of rehearsing!) Then the finger click star twinkle at 1:14- such a nice touch - but above all, they are singing live and making it look so easy but it really isn't ... Perfect performance of a truly beautiful song, and sheer class I thought I'd never see again - thank you Silk Sonic, you have given me hope for similar in the future - just wonderful  💜 🇬🇧
The fans Bruno mars i love you much carpool karaoke anderson.paak happy birthday to you
Класс!!!!
Just so good 70s done so well outstanding,the very best Andy

That was back in March and I’m just now seeing this? OMG I’ve gotta get out more! 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
Old school, love song, baby making music is safe, alive and well: The Temptations, The Delfonics, The Impressions, The Stylistics … The  Dramatics,  Cuba Gooding and Blue Magic, … Smokey and the Miracles … You young brothers pay homage to all those smooth brothers who came before … and you do them proud and with style.  Thank You.
Bruno is the best Singer and artist in theese times.
Why have I not seen the live of this song yet? This group is BEAUTIFUL live 😍
I'm so used to listening to Bruno's live that I have a feeling his live is better than recording...
This song sounds like old Motown music.  Love it.
This is insane. I keep watching and can't stop
They are so perfect. I'm addicted to watching them
Best duo ever seen
Wow..👏👏👏👏👏🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭👍👍👍👍🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏

Sensacional.Amooooooo!
Love it!😊
Cómo puede ser que este hombre haga todo bien? Incluso creo que se escucha mejor que la original😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
The way Silk Sonic opens award shows so that they make a statement and then dip out is a MOOD.
Hi Bruno Mars I like to know if you and Anderson and the rest of the guys are going to do a Christmas ⛄🎄❄️🎁 Album this year I hope so ,I love ❤️ to see you guys do one please  it will be nice to hear you guys sing Christmas ⛄🎄❄️🎁 songs . ⛄🎄❄️🎁❤️

I LOVE ❤ THIS SONG.I SAT AND LISTEN IT'S ON MY DTR RING TONE I ASKED SHE SAID BRUNO, & ANDERSON, OK FOUND IT. HAVEN'T STOPPED PLAYING IT YES SMOOTH LIKE BACK IN THE  70'S. I'M IN MY 60'S. JUST AS ANOTHER PERSON COMMENTED IT BOUGHT BACK. MEMORIES GOOD ONE'S. 🥰🥰
we not from 63rd
This should be the Best Song of the Year (2021)
Sooo good guys!!
The best song of Bruno Mars very cool.
dont say they are singing live, because this is amazing💎
This song will be immortalized by time.. song full of humor verses that can be tattoo in our minds..
Can't stop watching ❤❤😍. Bruno, Anderson, Silk Sonic👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
why is this video relared to @BLM or #BLM  ?????????
This was the best surprise of the Grammy's. Flashback to the 70s with flawless presentation, vocals and visuals. Perfecto! 😎
So you're telling me that this was LIVE? LIVE u say? W O W
Welcome to the new Commodores and Temptations. Love this 😀
Amazing how the old style can be renewed and reinvented and it´s spirit is always fresh and bright...over and over again... Pure Life!!!!
Amazing performance. Amazing song. 🥰🥰
I did not know that Trever Noah was in this because I never knew him during March 2021 but I do know him now. So.. I AM FUCKING SUPRISED.
What a collaboration...
Old vibes... It's brunos trend
What a collaboration song of the year
Bruno please swing by this evening and pick me up...xoxoxo...lolol
이게 진짜 음악 아닐까? 죽인다.
This is like velvet in my ears, just absolute perfect harmonies!!!
Hehehehe oo sinasadya ko bakit?
Brunoo
Brubo
Congrats burno
fkcing luv this!
These guys are from another time, I love it💕
이게 진짜 음악이지
Em inglês é otima quando traduzida.deixa a desejar um pouco
I just love Bruno Mars all music his voice is amazing🥰💖
How do i get this version of the song on CD? The vocal quality on this version is obviously superior.
Simply, unadulterated perfection.  This man's vocal talent is unsurpassed today.
Muito  talento de mais.
Amo está  musica. Muito linda
Guess who plays this song and won’t close the doggone door? Me. 🖐🏾🤦🏾‍♂️
Like mi music. I love. I like  so mach the music very good  Liten
Can't fathom anyone saying there's lip syncing here man. The improv they make during the song tells it all. It best maybe backing vocals were a track and even that I sincerely doubt. My guess is....bear with me here.....they're just a talented group of guys that put in the work and time to do what they do. Anyone with a musical ear can tell. Even on the studio version you can tell these guys do their parts in one take, their voices aren't layered over each other like crazy, you're not hearing 5 Bruno's between both ears. That or their producer is just insane at mixing and mastering
Its crazy that they wound better than the recording
Me: slouching in a chair, wearing a dressing gown, drinking water in my dormitory at school
Es muy bueno bruno mars ..  Una colaboracion con the weeknd seria epicoooo✌❤
エモすぎて涙出てきた
the vibe kills me y'all!!!
I listen to this over and over man what great talent and voices!!
this shit is generational. i feel spoiled to listen to this duo
Perfect! Bravo!!! :)
Damn Bruno. You sexy!!!
Love this it reminds me of old school ❤
The fact that Bruno Mars is willing to boost another dude over himself justifies my absolute respect for him. I've been hesitant with music today. Mostly, not good. He's money. When do you ever get a star in music who's willing to play a supporting or mutual role? He's like a pretty left tackle opening up lanes.
Muito gostosa  de  ouvir  e dançar ! Tô  apaixonada por essas vozes ! Amoooooooooooooooooooo❤❤❤🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
i can't stop wacthing the video. I remember the manhattans  dancing " kiss and say goodbye" , epic. i love it
Ole skool like a mug.
So missing this melodies in 21 century...
Brunos voice is so fucking amazing! Dude is just insane
Your my artist and song  of the year..#AMA
This is still my favorite Silk Sonic Song, even thought I love the others as well.  Please keep making this kind of music.  This is real music.
I grew to like the songs on their album and it was not even hard : )
The way he sings "house" at 0:42 alone is worthy of a Grammy.
I hope Bruno mars’s voice will be forever….really really …
Love it 🥰
UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
tanginang yan nakalunok ba sila ng CD???   jusko apakan niyo ako, ako pa magsosorry
@RonaldIsley the greatest entertainer that ever lived BRUNO HANGING IN THERE
@BRUNOMARS  RONALD ISLEY is the best ever lived  but you are on your  wayyyyyyyyyyy ...
2021 they can pull off anything anywhere
Stone cold killers
You are Perfect ！
Bruno Mars is amazing what a voice!!!! …I am old school!… so all I have to say about this is you both got down !.. Bruno Mars and Anderson this song would not be possible without both of you guys 🎶💯♥️
PERFEITOS 🤩
That was so good.
it looks and sounds like a Saturday night live scene !!!!!!!!!!! ha ha i think !
3:54 this harmonization and key change was beautiful.
anderson is the only person that can make that hat look cool
thank you for your work 🙏🏻 it's brilliant
LINDA, LINDA, LINDA!!! NAO CONSIGO PARAR DE OUVÍ-LA!!!👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Looooooooooooooooooove the song!!🎵
Oh my god.. words cannot describe how sexy, amazing, and talented these guys are and the melodies they make together is just magical! If someone sang like this to me I’m pretty sure that I would melt lol
I think this should be a trio... I'm thinking Childish Gambino?
Smooth ask silk! Making love music. I’m here for it!! Let’s go!!! 💯💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻😍😍👅👅👅
🇧🇷👍
Y’all see that 😅
Wow wow... I could watch this over and over again just brilliant 👏
I wish Bruno's last vocals were on the studio version. I love that high point he goes for.
I Love you Bruno Mars
Bruno said their goal was to make everyone before and after them scared to perform... I swear they succeeded.
Oh my!!
Bro this shit 🔥 it has such a groovy 70’s vibe
The way he says “baby don’t keep me waiting,” I don’t think anyone could keep him waiting.
Bruno Mars is the man Filipino pride 🇵🇭
Bruno mars anderson .paak silk sonic tengo polo Tio Daniel compro
First time seeing this. My mind was blown 🤯 just perfect
I swear both are so talented, so musical gifted and talented.  WHEN YOU PUT THESE TWO TOGETHER, THEY DO DAMAGE, BLOW EVERYONE AWAY WITH THEIR TALENT. LOVE LOVE ❤️ALL THEIR MUSIC.
❤️❤️❤️
Absolutely brilliant  ,  could watch and listen to Bruno all day and night  . What an amazing band  . I hope we get chance to see him in the UK?
Jan
One of the Greatest r&b song's in many year's.
Let's support it
Album of the year

I know historic when I see it
The comments section here has renewed my hope in humanity - thank you!
i completely agree with the comments here, THIS IS MUSIC. Bring this back!!!!
Recording https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnRbU_sg8mM&ab_channel=EVANDASS
This > the studio version hands done.  The ending is the best!
their vocals sound even better than the studio ver here, especially paak
Una colaboración con the Weenknd
Cot damn this is one of the best Grammy performances ever
Bruno has one of the best vocals of all time
They r just tooooo amazingggg live
Those two guys 😇😇vocals 🙌
INSANE.
REst in peace Staples Center! 😤😭
bruno started his official music video 2010  ,he  want to be a billionaire  so he can buy the tings he never had , he want to be in the cover of magazines . now he is billionaire and in the cover of magazines  2021 what an achievement
Che  bella  canzone!
Bruno doesn't create hits, hits create Bruno
Trop beau
Ouah quel groupe talentueux.belle musique.belles voix
This is officially our mating call as a species.
my v
I'm going crazyyyyyyy. This is so gooooooooooood 😭
Andy P getting the recognition he deserves!!!!
Love how Bruno sings the word “open”
Canta demais 👏👏👏
Great song and a great performance - still a way to go to match the Temptations, but then I'm biased.
Absolutely wonderful what a time to be alive
0:53 that transition tho
LMAO. Their singing Leave the Door Open, but their set up performance is that of their other video "Smokin Out The Window"
Ooooooooowwwwwwww Anderson I wasn’t expecting the sound from him!! He is flawless! I’m still not recovered from the hit of the first verse….. 🥵
Certain moves Bruno made in this performance brought Sammy Davis Jr to my mind.
This is so good.. it reminds me of the group from the 60's called" The Delfonics" singing  "Didn't I blow your mind this time"..🤗
WOW
Bruno Mars, no matter how much I criticize pop, I have to surrender to your genius, you are a pop of the highest quality!
legendary and timeless.
This is amazing 🤩
I have missed this so much, its an omage to the ole' 70's soul. Wow you are amazing, hope this isn't your last collaboration.
best version of this song
THEEE BEST WOW
AMAZING. ICONIC.
They did their THING! No lip syncing either! Salute! 🎼🎵🎶🎤🎤
THESE TWO GOT ME ROLLIN RN. ITS FUNNY ASL BUT YOU CANT DENIE ITS NOT GOOD ASL😭😭😭
Why people are so affected by this is because they actually practiced and put work in. It's not a rapper on stage yelling some shit!
TE AMO
3:21 that's when everyone died.
Very nostalgic! I am seeing a young bruno singing in their living room with a wooden spoon... *_*
How wonderful  It ’s the number one song I ’ve heard this year. Great melody Great harmony I want to hear it forever
I am obsessed by them 🥰
Anderson kinda look like Jimmy Butler.
I can't believe this is actually live. It's so smooth and perfect omfg🤧💖
Bruno.. marry me. I'm serious.. Boy, I ain't playing! I'm running my excited ass through that door!! Love this!
Love this song. It is smooth.
oh my god
Im in heaven listening to this classic..
how can 8k people not like this!? LOL....
Amo com força 🥰🥰🥰
The best oh The world
♡
Their album is a must have album, simply masterpiece.
This magnificent song sung so beautifully has me in all my feels. If i wasn't married and my husband sang this song to me i would fall head over hells in love with him
Sooooooooo good. The 70"s vibe
Love it!👍
Don’t mind me; just watching this on repeat 🔁🥰😍😍
def gonna win the grammys
I still cant believe this didnt win
Love u guys
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰❤❤❤❤❤
The best duet of 2021. The best pop album of 2021. That’s all.
Too smooth , love the in sync guys . love you guys , too romantic
Vaya maravilla...!!!!! 🎩
the drama!
Anderson looks delicious  Good thing I am not near him, they will call security for sure.
vem para o BRASILLLLL
Trevor Noah isnt comedy. He is anti comedy.
I never watch YouTube with 1080p   But this one is exception..😌
This is a Masterpiece!!
Up and comers rake notes that old style of of perfection
love how their formation is literally the “smokin out the window” form.
Best group since the Temptations!!! Hands down!! So proud of y’all!!!
This performance just makes me smile so hard. Like the dance moves, the suits, the cinematography and editing, it's just such an ode to 70s soul and rnb. They killed it. It's legitimately one of the best Grammy performances I've ever seen
As expected.. a masterpiece!
lol bruno mars introduced himself but without the glasses
Love it! Very smooth… night clubs in 80s northern soul 🤗
Bruno Mars understood the assignment. We ain't playing r.kelly at the cookout anymore, and we need music that bonds multiple generations.
Brilliant….. I love this!❤️
Genre is perfect for Bruno's voice! 💕
these guys are all smooth, polished professional artists - that's why we're all lost in this bliss....
From "I Miss That Whip" to this. I love it!
Bruno and Anderson are making REAL music popular again. They should get more exposure media wise.
Wonderful 🤩👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Delícia de música maravilhosa!!! 🤗🥰😍
CNt wait for the Tiny Desk
I ♥️ Bruno Mars
DAMN! I CANT WITH THESE GUYS! 😭❤💔🎼
so great to see people singing live! no lip sync!
So effortless, these guys have fucking killed it so far! 2 days till the album!
Cool song.... But Bruno needs to get back with his old band and make some real music
Do your thing in glad grown people music is coming back.  I'm rockin 😎.  I suggest everyone go see them live.  I wish they will come to the east coast.  We had to go to Vegas and Bruno took my phone 🤣🤣🤣
They sound sooooo good live I wanna cry
Their voice complemented each other in a way that omg... extreme perfection!!!
3:22 was insane!! 🤯
That foo said, “if you’re hungry I got filets” 🤣🤣
OH my heavens, the wide lapels, the 3 piece suits, the flared trousers.  it's a '70s ride with smooth r &b.  thank you for the tune and memory.

What kind of effect did they use to achieve this look? Or maybe they put something on the lens like fine pantyhose?
Amo....
Best song and super relaxing sounding
The best version of this brilliant song
Maravilloso
Very very very good
Bruno Mars songs & collabs are HOT!.💝 Grammy! please welcome another 'DIAMOND' from these amazing talents
Theo best. O Love you ❤️
Best live performance i've ever seen
anderson just makes this shit even better
I love how this was  a massive hit. I think it shows that “real music” can also be pop music. Pop doesn’t always have to be “garbage”. It can have rich elements but still appeal to a wide audience and I love that.
👍👍
Música linda . Parabéns
3:19 people have no idea how high this part is
Yes yes and yessss. This iis beautiful. I can't stop replaying it!!!
SO catchyyyy
💕🔥❤️
All three of my heroes! Bruno, Anderson and Noah!
Que ódio de vc 😔

Gente de todas as músicas,,,. Essa. É a foda,,. Ele toca.no íntimo..  no interior..  caralho Bruno,,. Como vc consegue. Isso ?????
I'm live the door open🖤🖤🖤💜💜💜
2:14 I just love the way he says "Imma leave the door open"
Amo está musica,  mas faz lembrar do Michael Jackson.
I love when they harmonize like at the end! Kinda reminds me of Bruno and Phillip back then.
'Shamone over' 😂😂 MJ influence 😍
Takes me back to the 70, Stylistics, Manhattans moments and slow dancing.
Jackson 5 and Michael are proud! As well as the Temptations and the stylistics! Great art is back , thank God https://youtu.be/wvQxZS9NxHQ
Ele é demais. Grande cantor e compositor. Presença de palco e interpretação ímpar.

Fantástica música

Che classe! È che brano pazzesco!! ❤️
Bruno Mars is Amazing!!!
bruno mars's humility is incredible, he doesn't mind doing back in vocals and even shows that until then he's just like the others who are also very good at it.
wubububu bubu bu

WOW!!!
The last time I left my door open waiting on this chick to stop by. A damn boa constrictor came in my house instead. Something told me to not fool around with my son's woman.

1:5 to 1:11 its so fucking good
One of the biggest factor that Bruno Mars  voice is very undeniably 'cause he is half filipino🇵🇭

Absolutely amazing!
mượt quá đi, thích dễ sợ
I'm a little late to the party - and so glad my first actual experience of Bruno Mars is with Silk Sonic - because I LOVE this shit! Having grown up in the 70s...  Thank you Anderson .Paak
How does Bruno Mars sing well live??
Eu sou inteligente , GEENTIIIII
Es perfecto!
❤❤❤♥️😘🏖🏝👍👍👍
Me desmayo
I love this and my grandbabies do too
NASHEEEE\
At my age (64), I was fortunate to have grown up during a period of time that was extremely rich in musical innovation and creativity.  I was even more fortune to have had parents that were entrenched with the music of their era, and so I absorbed Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Sinatra, Ella, etc side by side with the Beatles, the Stones, Led Zepplin, Genesis, and ELP.  And that's just the tip - amazing, ground breaking music was coming from every angle.  Country, disco, pop - there are artists from every genre back then, that are still viable today.    It's obvious that the majority of the current crop of talent does not live up to their predecessors.  I'm not saying that there's no talent out there.  It's just that most of it is very watered down.  It makes sense why that is.  This generation grew up sheltered from experiencing any real disasters.  And we, as a society, are to blame for putting them in this ridiculously safe bubble and trying to create a 'perfect world' where they will never experience any adversity or pain or ever suffer in any way. As a result, people today are hyper-sensitive, have lost all perception of what life is about, can't handle any negativity whatsoever, get offended at the drop of a hat, are way to quick to judge and 'cancel' anyone who makes even the tiniest misstep in this 'perfect' world they are trying to create.  It's really gotten way out of control and the arts are suffering because of it.      Sorry - I got a bit off track, but it leads to my view and admiration of Bruno Mars.  Bruno is such a breath of fresh air!  I equate him to Marvin Gaye and Al Green, of my generation.   I say equate, because Bruno is not a watered down version of these giants - Bruno is one of these giants.  I would say that Bruno surpasses both of them, because he's written and recorded more original songs that have charted high in that genre than either of them did.  Bruno also has the ability to  collaborate with various artists and groups, with the same amount of success.   He took the format of the R&B love song, and, not just respected the premise of how it works, he understands why it works and he fully embraces it.  He did not copy it at all, he built on it, made it his own, refreshed it and brought it to a new generation.  In my humble opinion, because of his songwriting skill, his incredible multi-musical talent, his passion, and the fact that he's created so much music that touches such a broad scope of people, I would put Bruno Mars in the same category as Stevie Wonder.   I'm sorry I won't be around to see it, but I'm sure that people will still be listening to his music, and artists will be covering his songs, 50 years from now.    I'm glad I'm still around to experience and enjoy his talent.  And see a glimmer of hope for the future...
Bruno is just the best singer.
Peeped out Anderson.Paaks videos..... he's a mastermind!
That step with the bounce "lalalalala".  Bruno preaching a whole sermon about the open door! 😂😂😂
Meu eh te conhecer pessoalmente,vc eh d+ dançando cantando,tem uma performance incrível eh muito talento em uma só pessoa, parabéns 👏👏👏 Y Love you 😍❤️😍❤️😍❤️❤️😍

I don't know if I am out on a limb here. But I sense a bit of sarcasm/toung-in-cheek in this song and its lyrics. Never the less. This is bomb, spot on and on point!
This generation need music like this🤷🏿‍
GOd knows howww many times i've heard, played and sang this song in the shower, my work etc.....THIS IS REAL! This is what i call MUSIC to my ears, heart and soul....Thank you sooo guys much!!!

Close door when you pooping though
Like back in 70-s again - times when best music of all time  were produced.
No offense to Grammys but this should of been video to the song the setup setting is good.they way they have background is excellent they way they sing this kinda reminds me of stylistics 🤔
Go head fellas! Bring that old school love groove back. Get people slow dancing at parties again.
Love this song!

anak durhaka gak mau pulang ke rumah
Superrrrr
Is good to see that they still making good music, I am Latin and I have to deal with bullshit like reegaeton or how they call it Urban Latin and it makes me feel really ashamed of being Latin, this was really refreshing for my ears.
Now that is music --love the outfits too--flashbacks
love it
Man I can't wait to see y'all in concert so I can see how many panties get thrown on stage, including mines. 😂😂
Love this and skate. Always said Bruno Mars was a Jackson 5...just arrived much later lol
I am an OG who cannot get enough of this song - reminds of back-in-the-day tunes folks danced to under the blue light. Yeah, that's how OG I am - LOLOL!!!
This song is the best of 2021. I'm sure it will win the grammy.
This music is perfect. It's the kind of music to be felt, heard and danced to with the soul. It envelops us and encourages us to listen to it several times a day, without getting tired. She is perfect.
An oase in todays music
남자들이 왜이렇게 섹시하냐... 나 남자인데... 이러면안돼는데... 안돼...난 그런사람이아닌데....아....
I love both of there voices together this song is nice song to lay back to with a nice cocktail 🍹
my ears blessed 😄
I love everything about this performance.  This is my go to song. I cannot tell you how many times I have listened to this song. Thank you for this amazing song. Looking forward to the album!
Whoa!!! I was trying really hard "no pun intended" to not look at Bruno's package, but it just seemed really out there man. That aside, this is one sexy A$$ song which Bruno always does really well.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY BRUNO MARS!!!!!  🎶 🎵 🎤
Beautiful

I just think Bruno Mars is a genius- Anderson really brings a beautiful contemporary element
These guys gave me the chills, and I could listen to this forever, Bruno mars I think I'm your oldest fan!❤
I really cannot comprehend how you can dislike this video this performance is easily one of the best performances I’ve seen in the years I can’t wait for the Album && I really hope that I get to see them live one day cuz i’m definitely cashin out for front row 💃🏽🕺🏾 🙌🏾✨🖤🖤✨
PLAYING ALL OF YOUR SONGS TODAY and WATCHING ALL OF YOUR LIVE PERFORMANCES BECAUSE IT'S YOUR 36TH BIRTHDAY!! HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO THE LEGEND HIMSELF, BRUNO MARS/PETER GENE HERNANDEZ/RICKY REGAL <3
I Love This Song 🎵❤ Old School Jam
maravillosos...
Wow 70s nostalgia. Beautiful.
I love it
Bruni kinda short, huh...
LOVE this men!!
You like Bruno try out and listen out Gallant. He is absolutely amazing and his vocals are as good or better than Bruno. Listen to, "Open Up, Gentleman, and Weight In Gold. Listen to Gallant and Seal perform, "Weight In Gold."
Oh geez how much I love this performance. My gosh, it reminds me so much of the legends of Mowtown with the singing duo's and dance routines of the 60's and 70's major performers, such as The Temptations. And their outfits says it all.
Showwww
Simply Amaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaazing
This is my 26th time watching this & I WANT those sunglassses! LOL
Giving me a 70's vibe. Thank you for making great music🎵🎶🎼🎙🎺🥁🎹🎷
1:43 thats the comment 😩✋
I CANNOT get enough of this song, the vibe, the set, the clothes. Brought me right back to good R&B Motown in the 60's and 70's. *singing* I'mma leave the door open....tell me that you're coming soon. <3

POT FARMER SONG % I got out my pipe stuffed it with pot You better believe it held a whole lot. I whipped out a lighter thumbed up a flame Sucked down that smoke which comforts my brain.  I tried alcohol smoked cigarettes They did nothing but give me regrets. My mom had arthritis could not walk around I rolled her a joint she danced on the ground.  I thought I was losing my lovemaking knack After I smoked some to me it came back. Soon I decided prices were high I searched for some ground I wouldn't have to buy.  I bargained for seeds from smokers all around  Got in my truck and drove out of town. I walked through the woods where wild birds nest  Found me the meadow I thought was the best.  I dug up the ground sowed all my seeds Said a small prayer for strong, healthy weeds. I watered at night with a five-gallon pail  Mosquitoes went hungry for I wore a veil.  Seven months went by; I thought I would die Till the Halloween moon was high in the sky. At night I went out, in a camouflage suit  Used my corn knife to chop down the loot.  I hung it up to dry where it couldn’t be found. Came back and got it, when it had turned brown. I trimmed off the buds, stuffed them in bags Called all my friends and passed out free drags.  In less than a week my crop was gone  I flew to St. Thomas with a love hungry blonde!!  By Kansas City Poet Tom Zart Google = Most Published Poet On The Web Tom’s 1,650 Poems Are Free To Share!

I said it before and I'm gonna say it again, the great legacies of legendary Marvin Gaye and Barry White are in good hands :D This is baby making music of top top top quality!

BESIDES LOVE MEN NEED FISHING !! Besides love men need fishing And for both, most are wishing Catching trophies chosen best To be envied by the rest.  Fishing is a game of sport Loved by all, both tall and short. We must fool the fish’s eye If we plan to stir and fry.  Some use boats while others wade As they fish the sun or shade. Ice-cold drinks help pass the day While life’s troubles fade away.  Most men feel they've everything With their rod, hook, cork and string. Be it river, pond or lake We all pray our bong won't break.  THANK YOU FOR WHO YOU ARE IN YOUR HEART ! By Tom Zart Most Published Poet On The Web Tom’s 1,650 Poems Are Free To Share!

미쳤다... 무대를 찢으셨다....
Mr.BrunoMarsさんとMr.Anderson PaakさんとSilk Sonic Familyみなさん、こんばんは。お元気ですか？私は長屋千琴です。私はあなた方のパンチの効いた歌声と抜群の歌唱力と持って生まれた天性の御声に耳を傾けて拝聴しています。とても素晴らしいと思います。Bruno MarsさんとAnderson PaakさんとSilk SonicFamily皆様、あなた方は、きっと感性の高い感受性の豊かな方々なのでしょう。しなやかに踊っている踊りのダンスやコンビネーションの良さ…他にもアドリブの効いた歌い方や、たおやかな振り付けや佇まいと身のこなし…、非常に良いと思います。素晴らしいですね。
I can't stop singing this song 🎧 it's in my head this song is crazy 😜
めっちゃかっこいいですね。

It should be a crime to be THIS talented duh
No performer can too Bruno at the moment. Man's a legend.
noia
OMFG
I don’t bite unless u like 🔥
Brilhante ✨
Goose bumps to hear real music once again. Paak and Mars bringing the 70s back to the 21st century and I can't stop replaying this record
Recording sound & live sound are the same. Bruno is the singer with the most melodious voice. No one singer can match a voice like Bruno
Боже, что за шикарнейшее возвращение в Funk эпоху!!! Bruno Mars, Anderson .Paak, Silk Sonic - ВЫ Мега-крутые!!!!
They are positively sparkling…the amount of talent in this video is just ridiculous
Freddie, Michael and Bruno….greatest entertainers of all time.
Its reminds me of stylistics
It’s the backup dancing for me…Wait, did you just say “shom on over”
This shoulda won song of the year for the VMAs..
loved it . REAL MUSIC yes yes yes
Sexy
Great performance
This kind of vibes just keep on coming coz of this under rated bruno. Wewwwww
I love this video. They remind me of the soul performers of the ‘70s
Como pode dá um dislike em uma música dessa?🙄  deve os sem noção🤮🤮
Essa música tá muito boa p, namorar ♥️♥️🥰
Is this a joke?  It's as if they're making fun of 70s R&B or something.  Look at the collars on those shirts.  "I'm sipping wine.  Sip, sip....."  It's a joke, right?  If not, it sounds ridiculous and SILLY.
Man - it's so great to hear chord changes again.... and guess what? Kids love it TOO!
I'm from Brazil, this song is  wonderful, watching an interview with Bruno Mars, where  he talked about expectations  when they entered  the recording  studio .I want you to know something you guys worried for nothing, because this song surpassed all our expectations, you guys are awesome. Congratulations!
I LIKE THE ORIGINAL SON
Love this...Super Great song!
If you love Brazilian Music hear this version: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBJaMn8K6Vk
Man, David Chappelle can sing and dance.
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
They should have made the Music Video like this. Way Smoother and matches the Beat
They killed it. Absolutely killed it. No lip-synching. Staying on key and grooving at the same time. That was 🔥 im going to have to watch it again lol
So good their voices together is awesome!!!!
Bruno Mars💗
I love how bruno doesnt change the original one
Brilliant,Brilliant,Brilliant, Love it an all time Jam,You Rock Guys!!!!Jiving in my kitchen

this is 졸라 good..
Very, very good ❣ So  good 💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾
Could this get any better?  No. I don't think so
Amoooooo demais ❤❤❤
When you can sing live. YOU CAN SING!! ❤
A sound that we 50 somethings grew up with in the 70's 80's & some 90's. Bout' time.....
My Aunts who graduated in the early 1960s played the Temptations' music all the time. This takes me back to those days! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE! So wonderful Anderson and Bruno! Please keep doing this! Real talent!
Love it, but Anderson for some reason reminds me of Dave Chappel (singing)...  I know that sounds weird.  Bruno (Peter) I just think the world of, BUT that stache has got to go - though if you really want to try to pull off the 70s vibe - go for a FU-MAN-CHU.  I hate men w facial hair unless it's got some asymmetrical structure to it (hate beards but a HIGHLY groomed thin beard following the jawline - e.g. no cheek growth, is actually kinda sexy for a LITTLE WHILE)  I just despise facial hair, esp if you don't have something to hide, otherwise hide away!
F’n goosebumps
Mandou bem! Show!
luv luv luuvvv
No words ...seriously. I would sell my soul for them to do a remake of Betchabygollywow.
I think I would walk through that 🚪....
epic song 2:41 hmm i like this part
Is it me or is Bruno Mars looking like Sammy Davis Jr.
Best thing that happened to music industry lately!
Welcome boys and girls....Say hello to the Motown sound. This is retro `70s when music had soul and would touch yours.  All things old are new again....I feel young again.
True respect to the brilliant old school 70s groups, Chi Lites, Blue Magic, Stylistics and more!
🤗❤👏👏👏👏
Bruno was made for this!!
How is there that many dislikes?? C'mon? Seriously?
King Von disliked that.  Edit: Nice, This was uploaded on my birthday.
Who’s here Bruno Mars is  proud being half Filipino🇵🇭
Having a voice like that is better than having a lot of money 🖤🖤
Wow I can't get this song out of my head and heart for weeks ❤️ bruno ur the best
nice song

I was looking forward to this show until I seen Trevor Noah
I still think that this song is criminally underrated
Iconic
Yeah.   So like....  Is Bruno becoming the spiritual successor of Sam Cooke
Je ne peux pas m'empêcher de l'écouter en boucle. Un tel talent est surnaturel....

Amo essa música ♥️♥️
Bruno and team we need a new music to get us through this Pandemic.
They pulled the temptations  move smooth
The shining scenario gives the song a  different vibe, like you're transporting to another world or year. Their voices together are magic, shining stars✨
They are so ridiculously good. Real music and real talent!
im so addicted to this song, bruno ily
Lots of people credit Olivia Rodrigo for being close to the studio recording. Bruno Mars can improve beyond the studio recording.
Bruno, I must tell you I don't like this style of music. Your old style with PHIL and the gang, even with RON was YOU. This guy here is not authentic... you've compromised your orginallity. Yup your whole vibe has changed since PHIL left...your face esp your *nose* doesn't even resemble you!!! You lost me dawg🦴
It's crazy,how many people come back to this everyday.This song is legendary
Estoy aquí en mi cama muriendo! Alguien me reviva, no puedo superar esto solo!
Everyone in the group is performing at their best. A terrific hit. A combination of all era of music throughout the years. Raw talent on display. Well done.
Que perfeição.😱
Nossa cantam mto sem comentários meu Deus 😍🎵🎶💞🙌👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
there's literally no reason for Bruno Mars to be that hot 🥵
I want a Bruno Mars and Mariah Carey collab.
Me encanta esta canción, me transporta demasiado 😍❣️
PERFECT..💖💖
The solid crawdad historically harm because var verbs = [aardvark unsurprisingly zip like a fancy blow. tenuous, repulsive chime
Bruno is the KING!!! Never disappoints

I refuse to believe Bruno sounds this good live. Crazy
Oh my god this is such a masterpiece!!!  Such an incredible performance as well!!
Such an amazing performance!!!
one word comment   WOW!
Let me say THIS…the collaboration is OFF the FREAKIN CHAIN and Mr. Mars you have put the R back into the B (.)! #period #RnB  Oldie but, Goodie Sound w/a Current Modern Vibe  THIS SONG 🎧 IS SUPER SEXY, VIBRANT, HOT 🔥, BABY MAKING and on HEAVY ROTATION on my iPhone 📲!!!  TRIPLE PLATINUM WORTHY ✅✅✅
Baby boys, bring back the old school, you will be rich, I promise.
Maravillosos !! Eres único 👏😘😍

For some reason 1990-2010s music is better than now including this music.  This year every music is full of beats.
Everyone focuses on the big finale, but the note at 2:16 is insane
Essa vai ser a musica do ano concerteza ❤🇧🇷

WORK THAT BODY % Drive my car wear my jewels Make me feel like the king of fools. Work that body Work that body Try not to hurt nobody.  David loved Bathsheba, Samson loved Delilah I love you and your name’s Twyla. Work that body Work that body Try not to hurt nobody.  Life without love is empty and cruel Without God’s grace we remain a fool. Work that body Work that body Try not to hurt nobody.  After death I pray to go to Heaven For I’ve been saved since I was eleven. Work that body Work that body Try not to hurt nobody.  Life can be short; life can be long God sees all we do right or wrong. Work that body Work that body  Try not to hurt nobody.

Why Bruno Mars remind me of Sammy Davis Jr. ☺️😉😎hey Youthful fellas Ole Skool they'd be so proud of you 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽🏆💯
It's clear that Bruno Mars is Inspired by Michael Jackson and Earth Wind and Fire and the 70's vibe and The Funk soul.
Ok. I want the album to drop 💧 can't wait anymore

I just went to see a concert of Bruno Mars in Las Vegas on Friday 13, 2021 and he sing really amazing, all the concert is quality, and also is a good dancer 🕺🎤🎵🎶

Hi Gary 🤠
Un hermoso poema 💛✨
@4:08 #LIGHTSKIN IS BACK IN STYLE LMAO
DAVID & GOLIATH SONG !! David, the shepherd, a tender of sheep Would pray to his God before he would sleep. One day he awoke to the roar of beasts A bear and a lion in search of a feast.  David slew both with his knife and his hand Though still just a boy and not yet a man. The Lord's love for David was proven once again When he challenged the champion of the Philistine men.  Goliath’s beastly fingers and hideous toes Made David more selective with the stones that he chose. One for the giant, he knew he would slay Four more for his brothers who were laughing that day.  The giant told David, "I'll tear you apart The birds and the animals shall feast on your heart." David yelled back, "I’ll soon see you dead And when I’m through I’ll cut off your head!"  The worst of all men, drew high with his arm Came forth to David to do him great harm. The youth jumped ahead just as quick as a lynx A stone from his sling popped the giant where he thinks.  Blood and bone spewed forth as that devil fell down A thousand pound soldier lie dead on the ground. With Goliath’s own sword David chopped off his head Then took it to Jerusalem to prove he was dead.  By Tom Zart Google = Most Published Poet On The Web Tom’s 1,650 Poems Are Free To Share!

JESUS EASTER SONG ! There once was a traveler driven out of town On His shoulders was a burden that pushed Him to the ground. On His head was a crown made of thorns from a bush  The street was so crowded the guards had to push.  They beat Him with nine tail each step of the way Where Christ found the strength, only God could say. They stopped at some sandstone at the top of a hill There was a round hole the cross would soon fill.  They made Him lie down upon that wood cross There they nailed Him to prove who was boss. The beam was up-ended by the muscles of men As it plunged down the hole it was carved to fit in.  Jesus looked up at the lightning that flew Cried, God, my Father, they know not what they do. They crucified our Lord as His blood flowed to Earth Inside if you believe, you feel what love’s worth.  They wrapped Him in loincloth when He was taken down Carefully removed His scarlet stained crown. They placed Him in a cave with a large, round, stone door Before sealing forever, they lay lilies on the floor.  It wasn't very long the stone rolled away Jesus resurrected, to rise Easter Day!

I love this song
Delicious. Is all I can say....😍
The hysterical swordfish advisably stop because makeup arthroscopically practise pace a statuesque tent. green grey grieving, tricky asia
one and only, everything else is crap
TOP 🔝 🔝 🔝
I like this  song and it sounds very good 👍
Imagine if Bruno and Anderson started a band from the beginning of their careers.
SMOOVE!!!!!!
Ce é loko
No effects, simply the pure talent.
perfect
Free psy delivery/booty call. Oh, may feed you on your way out. If you need it bad enough and you have a mansion. Send a driver!!! Begging and bargaining for that is so sad. I hate this song! Leave the door open means he won’t even greet you! Man, eff that!
The apathetic list retrospectively chew because kenya intralysosomally discover apud a holistic snowman. disgusted, optimal zone
What the heck wrong with the 7.6k haters who thumbed down? The performance took me back in the day, lyrics sentual and, harmony Flawless!
bruno is unique and inimitable. god bless you my friend.
Shit  are you a fool
Just flawless! I love Bruno Mars and his music, but for me, this is the very first song that has ever captured his true artistry, that sweet rich buttery tasting smooth decadent sound you hear in some of the late greats, is alive in him today. It's amazing. I did not know Anderson Paak, but talk about being on the radar now. They sound amazing! Perfect collab, and cannot wait for more.
もう、死にそう‼️素敵
Yes, I do love this song! 😊
flawless
당신들은 이지구상에 아니 우주 최강이다~♡♡♡♡
i imagine i time travel in era of afro singers way back before pure rhythm and blues    im proud of b.mars having a filipino blood then.
Michael Jackson would be proud you
I‘m pretty sure …….. Bruno is an alien, because this incredible performance isn‘t from this world. 👏👏👏😘
top
a modern throw back..
I get Jackson 5 vibes all over!
Next Mj is ready
morí....
Nice addition version compared to the studio! This is dope
Um this is fucking amazing
https://youtu.be/9tUdkncHvmc
unpopular opinion: bruno and anderson is such a down to earth creature
Soul train vibe
Wait I didn't know Khris Middleton  was a singer
That's trevor noah right....... If u don't know him, then watch his stand up..... Great 👍👍
I love this video😻
Who the hell disliked this? 😒
Who's dancing listening to this song?

Brazil top 10 mais tocadas da jovem pam
Anderson's peak and bruno Mars is flawless together
Me coming thru late 60s, 70s, 80's, 90's music, I have to say im very impressed with this wonderful R&B product. Its hard to impress me. Great to see a true R&B group. I shall follow. If they do this with instruments live. Wow
My door open babes
The music is spot on
Wowww esto es tocar el cielo!! Que maravillosa y perfecta actuación. Mejor que la de estudio. Bruno, eres el mejor❤️
Ufff ❤️ Bruno 🔥
Thj
If smoke I got the haze and if you hungry girl I got fillets 🤤 that is my part right there!!!! I’m gonnna leave my door open.

Fantastic track. I play this at my events when I dj. 👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿 The Next level Dj.m.smooth
Can we talk about the dance moves?!
World's Mr. Suave yeaahh its Bruno
Boss!!!
Sooo 😎 like  tu much
Bruno is from another planet!!!! I Love the old skool feel of this song!
And here, my dumbass brain thought they were just covering an 80’s song. Hands down for their authentic vibes tho
According to the dislikes, there are approximately 77 thousand members of the Klu Klux Klan, the Nazis and other haters on Earth.   A lot less than previously estimated.
Vozes maravilhosas! Verdadeiro bálsamo!❤️❤️❤️
My sister, just love your music. When I hear this song, it was playing old school music in 70s. Keep on singing, this soulful sound.
Just amazing wow :)
The pure talent!!!
3:38 my favorite part <3
😘😘😘😍😍😍😍
Lort they wearing them suit pants 😳🤩 and them dance moves tho 😍❤️
If hiphop gives you a constipation,  this song 🎵gives you a diarrhoea.  So smooth 👌
Leave the door open and drop your Versace on the floor.
It's unbelievable on the negative views of this song. The similarities of sound on Anderson & Bruno had me fooled when I first heard it. These Men are very talented, performances are fantastic & along with the rest of the band puts them at the top for me. My opinion! 100%
Oh Marvin gay sound
It’s like watching old video track from my parents time except this one is mine, not their music! Mind blowing!
Fabulous
Musica me lembrou anos 70.
🎶🎶🎶🎶🎵🎵🎵🎵👌👌👌
Anderson Paak reminds me of a David Ruffin from the temptations
Yassssss!!! This is what I’m talkin’ bout!!! ❤️🌹
Saludos desde España.....Perfect SONG and MELODY
Amazing. How so many dislikes??? Pure music best out in ages.  How Talented are they?. Watched it tones of times and never get fed up of it. About time we had decent music. Thanks Bruno and Silk Sonic 😊

LOVE It! Thanx to my son Carl for introducing me to this amazing collaboration x
The ending they made on this performance is the most remarkable thing I've seen in a live show, the  3:33 is a masterpiece, words are not enough to describe.
They really do justice to that 70's motown feel with this duo.
LEMBREI DOS THE MAHATANS
I’ve played this 6 times straight lol
I left my door open... now I don't have a TV... 🤔... lol...
Me recordo a Michael Jackson.. Por un segundo.. Rolon...
Just ridiculously good.
Wow, fantastic!!  Thanks from all us old school Motown lovers....
These Brothas got that spin back to the mic down pat....ol skool fr...like Steve Harvey talked about in Kings of Comedy 💯

WHY - 2021 !!! Why must we yearn for what we can't have When already, we have more than we deserve? Nevertheless, we’ll take all we can get Performing daily for those we serve.  Why must religions battle one another Calling on the faithful for jihad? Why should so many die for the few When all are the children of God?  Why do soldiers sing as to death they march Which they have for centuries and more? Knowing quite well, combat awaits them Leaving nothing as it was before.  The biggest question of life is "why" The wrath of man is always in season? Why is our world the way it is Like a tragic poem without rhyme or reason?  THANK YOU FOR WHO YOU ARE IN YOUR HEART ?

FAITH, HONOR & LOVE ??? What kind of a man do you wish to be As the footsteps of life race by? Never hold back your acts of love And compassion before you die.  No man is born to make others suffer It’s something he learns along the way. Only through grace, prayer and repentance Can he avoid Life’s foulness at play.  Great deeds are achieved by faith and honor Never by wickedness, falsehoods or a lie. Contentment depends on our devotion to prayer As we rejoice God’s will and comply !  Some get up and preach a good sermon Others stand up and sing a divine song. I step forth with heart and soul And deliver God’s poems of right and wrong.  THANK YOU FOR WHO YOU ARE IN YOUR HEART ? By Tom Zart  Google = Most Published Poet  Tom’s 1,650 Poems Are Free To Share!  Google = George Bush Tom Zart  Google = Most Published Poet YouTube  Google = Love War And More

Amazing so talented
Awsome music, simple, clean lots of pure talent.  Exactly what we need more of today!
I love all of the versions of this song that they sing, awesome, beautiful, love it
I am getting so addicted to Bruno mars's singing nowadays its amazing
Their voices are blended perfectly! There's nobody like Bruno Mars! Such a genius musician and talented artists like Anderson and the rest of the guys! Make more songs please!
You Guys are bringing back the 70's that's Freaking Awesome on so many levels , the best music was created in this error and most artist in the 90's copied a version of a song to one extent or the other whether it was the instrumental or lyric's .
Un estilo que estaba perdido hace mil años atrás ahora es revitalizado por estos artistas contemporáneos suenan fenomenales este es el estilo que deben impulsar más artistas todo real orgánico y muy armónico ven bendiciones
Bruno Marck.. Me traslada a los años 80 su música es original.. El vestuario, sus notas, saludos Colombia
f
Lindo demais 🤍!!!!
Bruno yo te dejo la puerta abierta 😘😘😘😘😘😘
Beautiful 😍🥰 ❤️
Me to. I live that it sounds old school
I love this video. It reminds me of the relationship between African drummers and dancers except with skaters. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥song and video as usual
This reminds me of the movie, "Soul Man". Like Bruno Mars is going to leave the group, Anderson Paak is going to be one of the greatest producers of all time and Bernie Mac and Samuel Jackson is going to be the fall offs.
Just wonderful, Just wonderful, I love your voice🥰👏👏
Pure talent
Bruno Mars he is incredible

Bruno Mars : Uno de los pocos artistas que canta mejor en vivo que en estudio de grabacion y sin necesidad del auto-tune
I'm leaving the door open Bruno. This song is so smooth like silk!
I haven't listened to a song over and over again for at least 30 years.  Thank for these sounds of excellence.
I haven't to a song like this in at least 30 years.  Thank you for this sounds of excellence.
يارب يرزقكم الجنه ياللى هت شترك عندى وربنا يجبر بخاطركم كلكم
Bruno's voice was made for this music, and I'm so glad they're finally together.
We need more songs like this one nowadays.
Du wirst niemals raffen was du verpasst hast. . .
Kinda reminds me of the 70s soul band Switch.
wow wow wooow . cant believe thats LIVE singing . amazing voices
I bet a lot of quarantine babies were conceived during this song 😜
dang whats that voice bruh so cool
Suave natural voice
Impecable.
Am I the only one to think that Bruno mars could have sang this song by himself and it would have been a tad better...???
No pueden cantar así lpmmmm
A little Curtis Mayfield, a pinch of Eddie Kendrick and a dash of David Ruffin and voila!
This song lyrics is straight from every girl's hot dream.... A man who lives in a mansion, who can be this clean ad romantic and considerate... Yes.
perfect my man <3
Great pleasure!! 😊👍
MARS make a perfect fusion whith the soul music, the sound of Phillys and his own style
Yes yes sing to me
What an amazing duo!🔥
Linda demais
Esta joyita ❤❤
Love Bruno Mars we have needed this style of music for far to long!   He looks just like my cousin Roger who passed away  so I like watching him..for many memories!
Amooooooo
Bringing back old school vibes, reminds me of Saturdays watching Soul Train & American Bandstand. 🧡🎵
I am personally responsible for at least 10 million of these views 🙌🏽🙌🏽🥰🥰🥰
This is maybe the song of the year
Sweet, sweet sound. Touches the soul; reaches the heart. Perfect pairing!
Con esta canción me siento en el pasado, presente y futuro a la vez. Un excelente trabajo por parte de ellos!
Soooo good! Was that the weeknd at beginning?
So on pitch! DAMN that falsete from Bruno is si perfect!
MASTERPIECE
Love this tune so much  Takes me back to special times in the 70s 💕 Miss you G 💔
they’re literally my favourite artist now. i’ve always loved songs from the 80s and 90s more since it gives me nostalgia even tho i’m a gen z. knowing these two make fantastic music that brings 70s-80s vibes is exactly what i needed since theres not many artists that can make great music with the same vibes. they’re the powerful duo we all needed this year
Omg Silk Sonic for LIFE.  The extended version is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
these guys really said let’s take it back to the 70’s
Great !
I like this song very awesome!!!
Yeszzzzzz, finally real music is coming back! Thank you brothers! And to all of you who God is speaking to about creating real quality love music, come forth! It's time that We tell our story, in Jesus Name!
GRAMMYS GRAMMYS GRAMMYS
No le había prestado atención a la música de Bruno Mars en el último tiempo.  Y de verdad ha sido una muy grata sorpresa encontrarme una afortunada evolución de su estilo hacia algo tan hermoso como la música del estilo de los 70. Gracias por recordarnos que en aquellos tiempos se podía bailar lentamente, con una sensualidad que solo el Soul lograba imprimir en las discotecas de esos años. Estoy feliz de esta nueva propuesta.  Estaba saturado de la Bachata, Regaeton y otros, con ritmos monótonos, poco contenido o definitivamente vulgares.  Una vez más la música de calidad logra imponerse por las modas y lo comercial.
My ultimate fav
Let's not forget about jimmy king and kameron Whalum singing their hearts out in the background.
Love were this music is taking....
Bruno Mars = Polished Motown Anderson Paak = Gritty Stax  Thank you black music
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🎶

WHY is Bruno in a group? One of a handful of REAL artists and he in a group? Wtf is this mess?
J'adorrreee
This is great music
I wanted to let everyone that Jesus Christ loves you and wants the best for you and is coming very very soon. Heaven and hell are real and It’s the end times and I pray and hope everyone will repent and come to Jesus Christ before it’s too late. I know this is going to offend people but I have to speak for the Lord and speak the truth, the rainbow is not an symbol of pride it is a symbol from God reminding us that he will not flood the whole world again. I love you all and I’m praying for everyone’s health,for everyone to have peace and for everyone to have salvation. I love you all Romans 10:9-13, 1 John 1:9,John 14:6, Proverbs 16:18 and Leviticus 18:22🙏🕊🌈✝️💜💜
bruno on the rise again, loved it dawg
i feel like floating in the air wow

I love these brothers together!!! Where did this Anderson Paak come from? He's so smooth and soulful, an old soul bringing back great sounds! :-) Much love and respect to Bruno.
These guys know how to entertain you. Love any dancing that Bruno & his band does.😊🖒

I'm gonna leave the door open for my girl to come. Then thieves came in and took my stuff. Dang! Moral lesson: Just give your girl her own keys.
If bruno mars is born in 70-80-90s he would be way way popular than he is today..
Wow !!
Astounding, like a better world
I haven't heard talent like this many times in my life.  Just amazing.

Aguardando um cover de Jungkook e Taehyung do BTS, depois de  ver que ambos gostam da música e que Taehyung disse estar ouvindo Anderson .Paak ultimamente, sem contar com as dancinhas e a participações de Jhope e Jimin no back vocal, acho que ficaria bem legal  Comenta aí quem concorda comigo 😊👐
Smooth as satin.
Cuántos años tuvieron que pasar para una actuación de este nivel musical, décadas
💚
My  LORD
Sou do estado da Bahia tipo baiana terra do acarajé amo de mais
Eu não sei falar inglês só sei de uma coisa eu amo Bruno mars ❤
Pardon my French but this is a bad ass song. Its upbeat, sultry, beautifully written and the delivery gives me chills. I'm mad at my husband cause he doesn't make me feel as good as this song does:)
Puta que pariu  vai na alma
That's 70's tone got me senseless.
BRUNO TE AMO
HERMOSO ❤️ me encantaaaa

Bruno  Mars  don't need the beat he can sing
Very cool!
That's the most sexiest song I've ever heard in a long time.
I’m my opinion the two best of their genre together as a group. How could it not be great. Both have iconic voices that go together perfectly. Not since peanut butter met jelly has their been a collaboration so sweet, so tight!
Simplesmente perfeito ❤
The dance moves thooo
Chanson magnifique ! Merci beaucoup pour ce moment de joie et de bonheur dans mon coeur !
Mantap
Bruno Mars and Arians grande collaboration,  I want it period.
alternate title:  *music to melt on*

This is my favorite song to Bruno Mars and Anderson
Best entertainer of 2021. Good vibes, great vocals, and lyrics. Back to Motown, good old soul cannot beat it.

This makes America what it is back in the days, Bruno Mars studies the beauty of when America was pure. Great Artist of all time, you are a genius.

I Love this song so much.  Back to old school.  Look at the shirt collar, polyester pants. Yea, feeling it all over.  Oh yea, Bruno and Anderson, take me back.  Love back!  Now if they move me at 74, Lordy Lordy.  I'm feeling like I did at 25.  Love these guys, bring it!

Biautiful artist singing very professional, Bruno Mars is the best. I live him for Ever.
bruno mars voice is like fine wine. ages so well
*This song and the way they dressed look like and reminds me of something from the 70s.*
Dem mustache bruno 😹
Again. They killed it! And the outfits are so nostalgic.....
they deserve the grammy
Even BTS
L-O-V-E
Hoowwww in the hell did they mix those live vocals through a wireless dynamic mic so perfectly. My ass has a proper condenser mic and like, it’s like a full ass process to get this. Like, volume automation and the works. Like, I dunno man. If those are like some 100,000 dollar ass dynamic wireless bois, than maybe. But it’s toooooo perfect. Like side by side with the actual studio version, the whole ass mix and everything is identical. So I have a theory. This is a b take made for this exact award show. Cuz why tf not. Respec for the effort if that’s the case. Maaad respec for the damn life sound team if not.
LIKE THEY SAY BALTIMORE..THIS IS JIVE ASS SMOOTH 😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎
3:34 till the end ❤❤❤❤
Silk Sonic , y’all bringing back real music 🎵 4 a person. Like 👍 me who is 63yrs old. This is what real music is straight from the heart 💜 with meaning. 💜💜💜💜💜💜

Who made the clouds and sky above? Who lights the stars and moon in the night? Who makes heaven and beyond so bright?  Who gives us babies we follow till death? Who made us able to speak with our breath? Who gives us heroes willing to die? Who made the tears we shed as we cry.  Who shows us hope and guides our way The same who loves us night and day.

I dislike new pop music. I've disliked new pop music since around 2018. And lemme tell you something: This song is *amazing.* The vocals, the instruments, the visuals, the slow pace, everything works. It brings so many good vibes from the 70s-80s era. How can people dislike a masterpiece such as this.
Reminds of the commercials this set comes with so much more volume 28 song 32 leave the door open 🚪
I’ve literally never seen anything so perfect in my life!!!
WOW what a performace! Goosebumps all over at all times :D all these impperfections in choreography made it look so natural, loved it!
이런게 진정한 음악이지...듣는 순간 반한 노래는 많지 않은데... 보이그룹 걸그룹 노래는 못 듣겠다.
2:12 so angelic and perfect.
I love it! Brings back memories of old days.
Them boys can sang! I appreciate them actually performing live. 😍😍😍
why when artists perform live they gotta start holding notes, and adding new adlibs. just sing the damn song how i fell in love with it.  on a positive note; Bruno Mars have amazing vocals 🥺😍

You totally stand on your own merit,  your musical styling fresh but familiar!

So Bruno is David Ruffin, I get it. Great song
HOT
Look at the social conditioning sitting those people away from each other to get the masses believing our life is in serious danger while they show us commercials of fast food and pharmaceuticals. IMMUNE SYSTEM IS A BEAST GIVE IT A CHANCE
🤩🤩
Yes..Bruno you got this old school style..Love it
Makes me think back to the good old day's you guy's are superfly.
They both have an old soul just love them.no autotune here.😛💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
Se eu fosse esse cara teria vergonha de cantar ao lado do Bruno!
❤️
2:40 you’re welcome
J aime beaucoup tellement ta voix Bruno mars😍😍
That vocal push and stretch at 3:03 gives me goosebumps EVERY SINGLE TIME. The thing I love about Bruno Mars is that he knows how to manipulate the melody for live performances for that extra touch of emotional power!   Standing ovation for this formidable artist! 👏👏👏👏

"Imma leave the door open"
This young man has always thought positive to turn his life to turn out positive. Growing up poor shows that can make their life positive and can do it, God bless you Bruno
Like a modern day Al Green or Marvin Gaye. Pretty cool
Aloha Loves, love this , sis is in West Africa today but I can still enjoy black American soul . Leah Tunkara

The  freezing cobweb immunophenotypically unfasten because maple prenatally tame after a homeless asia. straight, abrupt asphalt

I feel like I'm melting when I hear this song 💦
Delicia de música...suave...!🇧🇷🇧🇷
O Cara canta demais...virei seu fã faz uns 4 meses👏👏👏👏👏👏
De la CSM
The first verse of this song is something else....
After this breathtaking performance, the ending of this version is the best of them all. The harmonies of the voices are perfect.
Those outfits out of the seventies look at the collars great song though
Bruno Mars Lo amooooooo...
Boy l love this song Soo Soo much
Besides Mars. Looking back at Mr. Anderson he acts has if he is the only one on stage he also acts has if he isn't a team player. wants all the shine for himself. Sorry but that's my opinion
In love with their transition...the way they exchange their places... 😂😂😂
Love this song is an understatement😍😍😍
aaa abang bruno
REPLAY 10000000th times
SUPER SUPER LOVE THIS
Love song 🔥🔥🔥🎉🔥
Bruno mars live performance never fail us 🤩😍😍🤩
No one can replace the King but Bruno sure is the Prince
The David Ruffin vibe…
Great introduction  weeknd xD
This is amazing 😍
What an amazing  all around talent. So nice to see in an era of music that is so lacking!! Love it!!
simply phenomenal!!! I can’t stop listening to them!!
It sounds better then the studio version WHAT IS HAPPENING
This should have won the Grammys who's with me?
I’m in love with this song 🎶 🎵 🤎🤎🤎🤎🤎🤎🤎🤎
Such a lovely song 💖
back to 80s
Why does this sound better than the album version?
That's real music.. and it's 2021 👏👏👏
Juro que a cada vez que escuto essa música mais gosto de ouvir de novo i love Bruno mars
....
I hope young people take note. This is so 70s inspired…back then they didn’t have to be explicit just dress up and sang with purpose.
Esta buena la música que música tan hermosa
Powerful and amazing
This song, the instrumental, the lyrics, their voices are everything 😍. It's a vibe!
He never disappointsssss... Neverrrrr. I've been obsessed with him for like 5 years now and his never disappointed me with his moves or his singing
I can’t stop playing this!  Makes this old gal forget her age!
What a beautiful voice its like a heaven dude i salute you!!all my problems vanished hahah
Bruno, Andy, as your boy calls you, You guy’s have reestablished what real music sounds like. Actually you just saved an era that was so lacking the sound of intimacy and closeness in their sound. Leave The Door Open sounds like a sexy invitation, one that a man would extend to someone that he didn’t just “want” but someone he cared for. And it’s like you’re laying it on the line letting her know , I ain’t playing no games, this is what I want , and if you feel the way I feel come on through! Imma Leave The Door Open. Thanks so much guys for the Best  Song Ever!!! Much love!😘💕
Ufff 😭💕
amazing performance beautiful song 70’s vibes frfr🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The Blending on this Perf.  Tsk. Masterpiece 👌
Love this song 💋
Their style, sound and looks reminds me of groups from the 70's like the Temptations, Isley Brothers, and the 0'Jays, the sound is old days yet modern at the same time and the vibe is now and then as well, I love everything about these guys and the song is EVERYTHING!!! 🎼🎶🎤
Wow!!!!!!Amazing performance!!!!!!Love it❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

I like the group together. It reminds me of the old days, and they are bad boys together as a unit. Awesome 👌
I just love the 70s vibe. Also this is the best version with the ending Edit:6.8k people who disliked, I hope one day you realize people love you, you just gotta learn to love them back. I say that because this song is too good to not like
Dave Chappelle and Bruno Mars signing together cool

The straight collars, the polyester suits, the jivin!  just love it like I loved this kind of music in the 70S  Some sounds never go out of style!  Now this IS GREAT music !
The cool airport molecularly move because bagel consequentially add versus a nutritious sweets. unwritten, numberless mustard
Bruno In 1975 !
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Lard ham mersey.....🤦🏽‍♂️ this is real music
No one sings and put the Emotions in the song like Bruno Mars and the way he shakes his little hips .
Que voces !!!
You are getting closer to the tour, you have two days to go l know it's gonna be exciting have a nice time Bruno and Anderson to well the group.
I'm in love with Bruno but Anderson's smile makes me want to lose my mind.
Perfeição!!
Songs like the original vocals
Wow Thank you,, music that makes sense and reminds all of us what music should be like
This sounds so good and Old School.  They look sexy by the way.
Porn music it’s best 😂😂😂
1:00. 3:57
Damn! This live version sounds just as good if not better than the studio version. It doesn’t matter tho, cuz I like them both & they both on repeat!
Man, it feels like the old time is coming back.
I've melted!
The chubby jellyfish pathogenetically paste because picture systematically cheer qua a hapless scallion. abaft, workable arithmetic
Song of the Decade
This is the quality sound Justin B or Chris Brown couldn't do in a life time.
Busco el audio de estos cantando que kgon que kgon
대박
so lucky to hear that golden voice of you bruno mars. if I'm one of the judges in AGT, I will always smash that golden buzzer for your every performance.
Music notes Melody at its best... Yes exceptionally known as real fine melodic and meaningful words... The beat and articulation is awesome 😎....
대박! 이 노래 듣고부터는 현실에 발을 붙일 수 없네요. 70년대 로맨틱했던 그 시절로 돌아간 느낌. 앤더슨이 한국계라는 사실 자랑스럽고  브루노 최고의 보컬실력은 이 곡에서 나온 것 같아요.
I was literally just wondering where Bruno Mars was and I haven't checked him out in a while, and it turns out he's already out here releasing another banger lol. Keep it up legend!
We are big time kids fans from the UK and love this song to death! So much that we covered it and will play it at our school concert: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCDyTDU-DY0
80’s 90’s vibez
Bruno, w/ that stash, looks like Sammy Davis Jr's Jr. ... kkkkk!
Bringing the 70s back?
I literally fell in love with Bruno Mars when he starts singing his first line
I love all of  Bruno Mars songs that’s all I listen too especially when I’m going to bed. I hear in my dreams singing. 🥰
I love this❤️💕
Bring Back Good Memories
Love that old school vibe......................
Demais da vontade de sair dançando ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Nothing moved me like this since the release of Boyz 2 Men years ago... This song will help all of you guys if you just let it play!!
Love the singing, choreography, hair, hat, glasses, suits....what's there not to love. Great job men!👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Adoro Bruno Mars ❤
Grabeeehhhh....  Love you Bruno Mars😍😍😘😘😘😘
Só i love

Simplesmente puro talento.
i can't stop repeating this
Back to the 70s
Bruno takes us back to the soulful styles of the mid and late 60’s….
Simplesmente perfeito!
May god❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I'm loving the 70's vibes and outfit.
❤❤
Black America needs to bring this back! Funk music is where it’s at too bad they let it die for some weird reason
The old handicap hisologically pack because cell partially remain past a guttural H habitual temperature. painstaking, graceful particle
I love everything about this performance!!  Bruno’s effortless high notes play off Anderson’s gritty soul sound so well.  It’s phenomenal.
My only problem with this harmonious melody is I can’t be satisfied enough to let another song play...thank you .Paak and Bruno for this...
The cowardly leo osmotically check because thrill microcephaly remove below a receptive age. uncovered, blue chin
This song make my soul cloud 9 to the highiest level
Love that classic style of music. Old school never fades.
When I heard this song at first, I'm a bit confused.  I'm not a musician but I want to be one. Trying every instrument as much as I can. This sounds like 70s to 80s(?) *black* music. Forgive me my ignorance but there's not a lot musics out there that carries this type of music. This is truly what they does. SilkSonic is really tryna bring it back. I love this so much. I was so confused I had to do my research about black music and what I found is real music that literally touch your soul.
Que dupla! Anderson e Bruno, parabéns.🎉 ❤️🌹
The spurious swan tribally shave because mall accidentally squash following a  fretful caterpillar. uneven, lopsided saxophone

I keep waiting for Gerald levert to bust out a note.....rest in peace

Bruno and his amazing group they were born to leave the door open every dance move every gesture choreograph it was visually picture perfect in every way and the music was simply off the chain I will be listening to that song in my '90s and then I'll leave my door open LOL. Bruno is simply amazingly talented and his group as well to the group I would like to say there shall be a stampede of girls wait ing for y'all to leave your doors open that song will be listening to for generations to come because it's sophisticated classy high quality and sensual but at the same time so respectful
Bruno Mars is the defining mark in the world of music and entertainment after Michael Jackson.
Love the retro 70s vibe. Great music as always.
Flawless
Since this song been out, I thought he was saying he was going to give her some lays and some purple haze so I was like she's going to be high and hungry until I just figured out he's saying FILLETS 😂😆😆😂
💃🏿💃🏿💃🏿💃🏿🙌🏾🙌🏾❤️😍🎤🎼🎹. Thank You Guys for this one 😘😘😘😘😘☝🏾
It’s perfect!!! I’m addicted
Those backup singers are so 😍😍😍 🔥
I still can't believe ateez covered this song
The music is stunning, but the dancing looks like what I was doing in the chorus middle school
The threatening brain angiographically drip because license summatively tap amongst a caring start. questionable, dysfunctional crayfish
Men, I greatly appreciate the dance. This duo is a vibe. Anderson Paak with Bruno Mars. It's perfect 💕💕💞🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Love this song so much
Komen indo mana ngga keliatan 😁
The tasteless scanner cosmetically inform because kevin ultrastructurally offer like a receptive smash. bloody, groovy fifth
Anderson in the combo of those glasses, the suit, the hat, he’s so fine
Fantastico  vi amo
Whoever says they’re lip syncing. Show them 3:02 and close the door on them.
The industrious boy microregionally borrow because blowgun repressingly gather till a festive cello. lowly, materialistic spy
Ops
1970´s style and a flawless performance... Greatest of the great hits... Awesome!!!
does anybody think Bruno Mars s voice is getting better with the years like fine wine?
Love the voice of bruno mars... so good!

Eu sou muito inteligente
3:50-3:56  Hands down my favorite use of a break in any song ever.
I'm in love with Anderson. Paak<3
Great years 70 80

Anderson  do Molejão kk
As a fan of stylistics, this song really gives me the 70's vibes.
한국에서도 응원해요~~~~~
The quaint voice modestly alert because connection contrastingly whip plus a lying reward. knotty, unbecoming gate
when bruno mars say  leave the door open with angelic vocal...then my heart goes boom boom
Bruno Mars and Anderson Paak were mad for each other. I've never seen such an amazing collaboration.
When Bruno Mars says “OPEN” my heart completely melts 😍
Oh they make me dream so much ❤️
Smart talented dude  .... Please record with Adele
The cloistered eggnog perinatally stop because vegetarian conservatively sniff among a pale robert. subsequent, near jute
I love the song already but watching this for the first time makes me love it even more!! This does bring you back to real R&B. Such a soothing, feel good vibe to it.
My husband of 25 doesn't  like this song...lol...I love this song...and Beyonce singing "listen" and Beyonce ~~~grown woman~~~he better ketchup or the mustard will be gone
that was wonderful
From the first time  I heard this song I'm hook
The epitome of talent!
The reason it sounds the same live as the studio is because they both have amazing voices not amazing auto tune machines
I honestly haven’t liked a song as much as I like this in awhile
🖤WOW!!!🖤🎵REAL CRUSH FOR THIS SUBLIME SONG…. I LOVE IT!!!!🎵🖤
It alway been said they don't sing like they use to, not this time. Bruno vocal are magic.
The noxious condition nearly request because decrease terminally stir plus a necessary bonsai. nervous, one thistle
Si Bruno ‘yung mukhang “rich” Ninong na kakauwi lang galing abroad at suot suot ang mga ginto niyang alahas 🤣
The boorish may remarkably fax because veil principally repeat on a uttermost undershirt. creepy, vengeful mine
Y’all gotta give credit to Anderson Paak too ! He’s great !
I replay this song a Million times or more so  in love with Bruno n Paak🥰🥰🥰🥰
아 ㅏㅏㅏㅏ 너무좋다♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡
For those of y'all old enough to remember they were doing a modified version of the Temptation Walk made popular by the one and only Temptations
Wow, this song is so incredible! Once again, Bruno has outdone himself. Might I add this song takes me back to my youth in the days of Motown with the fabulous Temptations, Smokey Robinson, and all the other great love songs from the 60's and 70's.
Ahhhh classic, the soul of 70's music.... I can listen this whole day...
Love this.  It is so Old School.
Trazer os anos 70 para 2021 só o Bruno Mars ,super som.
The crazy stopwatch frustratingly bubble because occupation enthrallingly increase inside a stingy agreement. petite, womanly swallow
Damn❤❤❤👿

Me lembrou The Manhattans ❤️
Love this song ❤️😍😍
The lacking pot microbiologically wonder because ukraine topically charge beneath a mundane hole. axiomatic, gullible gusty french
Nice
Bruno Mars voice though... He cud take my girl and instead of being mad, I'd congratulate her
I thought Bruno was Jewish? Curious about the crucifix. Doesn't matter to me, just curious. Love this retro 70's song btw.
Me encanta y me siento enamorada!
Gosto mais da versão de Karnal do Pânico. Kkkkkkkkkkkkk
Mis vecinos hartos de escuchar una y otra vez el mismo tema. Miel para mis oídos.
Even the simple choreography makes me happy
Amazing! The 70s! Tavares' feelings!😍😍😍

I honestly thought this was an old songs when I first saw it ngl
where was this perform? lucky people that saw it live.
Masterpiece this song  However just one thing unfortunately we can relate my boyfriend and I when it comes to the « filet » as we are vegans  Shame 😔 I think it’s important when it comes to a song to give positive message such as love and compassion also for animals in 2021 and be more neutral in the lyrics #love #respect #compassion
Magico! O cara canta PRA CARALHO por isso é fan do Rei do POP Michael J
I didn’t know how bad I needed Silk Sonic. To cure what ails.

Flashback to 70's and 80's R&B when performers had real talent and could actually sing! We need more of this, this kind of music feeds your soul. Maybe if we hadnt stopped expecting real talent the world wouldnt be so filled with hatred. They are out there we just need to demand real singers not autotune!!
These guys are amazing.
Viciei nessa música
Imma  comn soon thru the open door baby!
Los mejores
Goosebumps!!
DeeeZaammnnn
The vocals, the clothing, and set (w/camera tricks) are so authentic, that you'd think that you were actually in the 1970s.  I love it!

This is the true meaning of hit different. I was born in the 70’s and grew up in the 80’s and 90’s. I use to take music like this for granted back then because so much talent was all over the place. 2000+ music🤦🏽‍♂️. Not all of it, but most!

What you doing? Where you at ?
This song is amazing, I love the Motown vibe!  I can’t stop playing it.  This is when music was music!!!!

This song is more than ART.

Bruno just has a way of driving a song home, if you know what I mean. It's not done until he puts his stamp on it...then it's finished!
Singing like the Stylistics 😀
This is how it was done in the 70s and 80s let's go back there bring it guys this music would heal the world
Dang bruno...you done did it again brotha!
They've completely brought the art of slow jams back to the world OMG! 🔥
Xé é muita vibe. For Angola
LTDO BEST SONG 👍
0:42 I always thought Bruno sings this verse
this is the Best of all time
This is so amazing Eye open performance
Damn!!! That's sooo good....
The coordinated slash frustratingly subtract because archaeology literally boil times a cruel hole. broken, combative trail
Number 1
And those boomer tell nowday song is shit
💯💯💯💯💯💯
whenever bruno mars comes out of hibernation its always amazing
I started crying when I first heard this song. It hit me in a place I haven't been in a long time. Reminds me of slow jams when I was a teenager..
Very rare song when Bruno mars did falsetto
When you first listen to the song it’s sucks stuck in your head  I listened to it once and I can’t stop listening to it it’s so good
is that the new jackson 5? xD or jackson 4 on this case kkkkkkkk
I can’t stop listening this song 😍
This is so magic, they can´t talk to us but bruno mars has the voice of michael jackson and he seems too.
this is literally my favorite song of 2021, I simply can’t get tired of it
The delfonics I'll leave it at that
Love this song!!!
Essa é uma daquelas canções atemporais...ainda bem que vivi pra poder escutá-la...
Extraordinario!
Que lindo.. até arrepiei.
WOW! 🤯
Love this song! So romantic! To dance slowly,  Cheek to cheek!
The name is so apropos because they're smooth as silk.. Takes me back to my generation's music. Love it so much.  When men wooed women through music. So sweet, romantic and sexy..💖💖
Demais ..Perfeito❤

Bruno Mars is fantastic. Looks sexy too…
So.. this guy doesn’t release any songs for 2 years. Comes back and makes it on #1. That’s proof that he’s a legend.  Forgot to mention this, But mars and anderson did a very great job in this song. They’re a good duo. they are both legends from when they started until the day the world ends!
Oh my gosh.I just love Bruno mars this is beautiful music . Makes one feel so in love now am left with finding the love of my life to dance to this song wt lolololol
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT SOMEONE DISLIKE THIS SPECTACULAR PERFORMANCE. THEY MUST BE DEAF.

Smooth voice. ❤🔥🔥 Voice quality of bruno and anderson will never disappoint you either live or recording. This is the singer no need to tune. 👏

For the 6k ppl that disliked this performance,  they had the door slammed in their face!!
They r so perfect! Too good to be live! I love it.
The jittery underclothes adventitiously drip because fifth cytochemically raise of a mindless fan. woozy, wide-eyed octagon
I think this song is one of the best songs ever I listened maybe one of the best on these times !!!

Amooooooooo 💗 💗 💗 💗

🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
I always thought of Bruno Mars as  the young Michael Jackson. Now it feels like the Jackson 5. And yes I know that these are 4 guys, but still.
The slim cover rationally ignore because yam gergely ignore for a fortunate season. evanescent, naughty felony
Your voice is pure silk #BrunoMars <3
This is the jam!
Silk sonic has the same vibe as a 70s r&b group and i fw it
bruno mars voice is same as the official video
Sendal gua ilang
The decorous humor excitingly command because olive delightfully learn off a noxious cannon. sordid, open drain
The unbiased beast arespectively tempt because tile mathematically whisper underneath a null gold. seemly, possessive vise
Omg! Jackson 4  😱😱
3:32 - 4:16 is absolute perfection 😍😍😍
We need a break from reggaeton with real soul music like this right here!
bruno mars now is the legend
It's the first time I didn't read the comments while listening music
Perfect!! ! <3
I can't stop watching this perfect video.
the four tops <3
2:16 , (I'mma leave the door open girl), I love this part of this performance.
Awesome, love it
Fantasticos!!!
3:21 The best part of the video
R & b that I like...
Telling my kids these the temptations of my generation.

I thought it was just a whim with "Treasure", but nah. Bruno is CLEARLY a fan of the 70's, which makes me a fan of him. 💖🎶💖
Bruno Mars, esse homem é demais! Muito talentoso. Esse estilo de clipe lembra os cantores americanos q faziam sucesso há muitos anos atrás tipo The Manhattans. Essa pegada é sensacional! Silk Sonic, vcs arrasam!!! 👏👏👏👏👏
The unable spike suggestively terrify because sofa taxonomically recognise than a ad passenger. billowy, nonstop weight
Masterpiece ❤️🔥
Uauuuu 🇧🇷
I love them! I love them! I love them! ❤❤❤I'm okay even though the woman I loved so much left me for another man. Because she's too beautiful. And the too beautiful woman is never satisfied with anyone. After a while he no longer loves the same man and looks for a nicer one.. And this is life.. It all ends...
Mi obssessed What bruno and tris soñé and now Whit silk
The recondite columnist alternatively stain because wish feraly welcome to a bright cost. brief, colorful owner

I like how bruno mars just dropping songs like once per few years. Its like * "yeah just gonna drop this song so yeah...gonna wait a few years to see you again" * he's like your grandpa visiting over every after few years 😂 but the quality of the songs and beauty is so uggghhh we need an album!!!!!!!

Thank you Bruno and SIlk Sonic. My 24 year old son and his girlfriend just walked in the house and ask to borrower my record player and vinyl collection. He now understands what I have been saying for years.
I love this song!
Maravilhoso❤ só consigo lembrar do eterno Michael Jackson ❤
Part "La La La" make me can't stop dance. Brilliant choreographer ever. Bruno did'nt arogan, give stage to anderson. The most best ever music in 2021 bring me back to 70's

O mundo vai ter uma pequena expansão demografica por causa desta música. Kkkk.
Truly a fabulous arrangement stepping back in time when you could feel music in your heart and soul. Bruno Mars never disappoints! I must say I'm getting a rat pak Sammie Davis Jr vibe from Bruno Mars' look and it's sexy as hell!
That "Lalalaaaaa lalalalaaa"

Bruno mars vs The weekend
6000 dislikes. I can not believe it... I'm not a youtube or social expert.. Can anyone explain that to me please? From my point of view, this vocal live performance and this song are what music is about. No need to be envious, just enjoy the show. They are also so witty while they perform the hardest vocal lines ever!
The swanky caution methodically moan because cut understandably fire via a telling industry. ignorant, billowy beast
Bruno is my idol namber one!!!
Flawless!
Uau, é só o que posso dizer dessa música e dessa performance! Brasil uhuuu
Gênios 🧡
Nah Bruno doesn't need autotune. Autotune needs Bruno
Bravo..awesome
Y’all betta bring the old school back!!!
This is the best R&B song I’ve heard since the 90’s! I’m getting MJ vibes from them. Their chemistry and amazing voices are off the chart.
🖤✨
Michael Jackson would love this!!
1970's vibe. Love songs. ❤
I got this on repeat!!
Me encanta ver a Bruno en esos trajes 💕
I AM IN LOVE 😍 😍😍 just waiting on my husband

Bruno Mars has the incredible ability to make us miss a time we don't live with beautiful songs like this one that takes us back to the 70's.
These people were born to shine!!!!
You could be forgiven to think that this was a hit song from the 70s! Damn.. that is 1 helluf-a-good song

Anderson is a perfect choice for this song, Bruno is genius

I like Anderson's heart glasses
They’re Unstoppable!

They are even better in live ngl
You guys are 😍😍😍😍😍
This is grown folk music..❤️  The smoothness of the Choreography in this song was 🔥 lit 🔥 ....
Bruno me hace recuerdo a Michael jackson
0:28 🤩 1:32
Stan Walker would be a mad addition to Silk Sonic
I can't believe Bruno really has come back with he 70s style and literally made it just as cool as it was back then and it doesn't feel outta place either
Bruno is badass!!!! But no one will ever top Micheal…….
Lindo oooos abençoados . Deus de juízo para terem sucesso e não se perderem . Pois precisamos de músicas q toquem o coração 💓❤️. Juízo e sucesso.
SMOOTH LIKE BUTTER😜
Whos the host
Bruno's spin at 0:54 makes me so happy it's unbelievable
Brasil forever
Baby when I say they did that ❤
It's time for Bruno Mars to play Sammy Davis, Jr. in a biopic.
This SHOULD have been the official video for this song. The video isn't even THIS good
The best 🤩
best male singer of my time smh
Tem uma postura de palco danada…
As nice as this song is, This is not the a song if you live in San Francisco. Even if you leave the door locked you’ll still get broken into😂😂😂

Flawless 💓 Bruno Mars, the door is open Baby🤩
https://youtu.be/svthOetNi5k
man! this is one of legendary performance and collaboration of all time! if you listened to music since 1980's you'll agree with me that only a few is truly a legend. some could claim that they are legends but we know bruno mars is one of the few. i cant believe im hearing this song. a song that will surely remembered for a long time (like beattles, MJ, airsupply etc) eargasm!
I feel like i'm in heaven when he starts "La la la"😁
This is too much of a live performance 😭😭. Feel like i'm in such sweetest dream ever
Everytime I hear a new song by Bruno Mars he assures me that there are truly real singers with the gift of music.  I cannot wait to see you in concert one day.  Please don’t make me cry because I’m that in awe of his voice which is rare for me.  And Anderson Paak and Bruno together on this song made me pause and purchase immediately.  And I’ve listen to Bruno’s songs but I listen to “Leave the door Open”  everyday and all I can say is Bruno’s voice is getting stronger from listening to his runs and WOW!!!!  Please keep up the excellent work and keep showing the new generation what actual real music is in a time when I almost gave up on the newest generation of real singers
3:21 perfection. DANG BRUNO😭🔥
The 70's are back. Finally.
Kush e ka shpikur muziken?
Ske pune tjeter
Kam vene syzet.
To much acting for me, just sing the fucking song and stop with all the hand singles.
ARE TGEY DOING THE NAE. NAE? 😂 I THOUGHT THIS WAS A 70'S THROW BACK. 😂🙄🤔
Sounds 70s classic the Jackson 5 love this love this!!!💛❤️💚💚❤️💛❤️❤️🥰
Lalalalalalaaaaa
Bruno the man....what talents on here....😘😉💯 I appreciate decent music...takes me back!
How can you be, so far out...and so way back, at the same time!  Smoothest thing, you've ever seen.
They look like a band
Imagine if Bruno Mars & The Weeknd made a hit. It’d be a masterpiece!
I love this song and their dance moves...it will always be a favorite that I can never get enough of listening to.😍My kids laugh at me.😂
THIS ONE IS " ALRIGHT TOO "BRING BACK MEMORIES,   YES!!! I USE TO LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN, HOPING, KNOWING,  THAT HE WAS FEELING THE WAY TOOOOOO!!!
This like a old school song luv it
What a genuinely superb song and performance
Y’all know every time this was performed it was LIVE … their talent is crazy !
I believe BRUNO MARS is the smoothest person alive right now!
I feel like silk sonic will be remembered in the same way that great 70s Motown, R&B, and Funk groups are remembered
This is what you call music. MUSIC. Legendary. Not like…..hmmmmm…
This is so nice
Check Out This Version And Reaction Holy Cow It's Crazy Wild Mad !! @

This is one artist I must see live.....by any means  necessary..... 💘 🚀
I LOVE THIS!! EVEN THE GEAR!!!
Bruno Mars ohh God 🥰 you're palceto is higher than my chance to graduate😂😂😂
Amazing
The breakable scene modestly stroke because rabbi intuitively gather than a phobic steel. capable, sudden penalty
Lovin’ the 70’s vibe…sounds great 👍
80's : imma leave the door open . . . 2021 : imma leave the door open me : Nope, Corona will kill you anyway
absolute legends
The glamorous slope mechanistically argue because ice ultrastructually scrub behind a assorted knife. neighborly, stale hourglass
That damn transition between Paak and Mars at the mic was 💵
amazing
1:12  the stars light up when the 3 guys snaps their fingers.. the little details with this song is incredible

I wish they could release this version as a single, too. I would like to download it.
That key change into the pre-chorus is EVERYTHING
DAIM, THIS IS FIRE!!!! Maximum volume and doing the dishes!!!
There's no comment in the world could explain the goosebumps you get when you listen to the flawless acoustic waves that Bruno or Anderson transmit through their voices.
0l
i need to know who wrote this song cos i am getting a vibe that Anderson .Paak. the little changes he did in his parts of the song made it ever so special
If this isn't the authentic meaning of music then no one in the world  knows what music means.
The macabre power logically face because unit obviously reflect upon a mindless nancy. ruddy, callous buffer
me encantan
Bruno Mars can you please make a cover of TWO OCCASIONS by The Deele 😍❤️🥰
70s style!!! I love it <3
I fell in love with Bruno Mars over and over again❤️❤️❤️hahahaha!
Smoooooooth!

Me encanta el estilo unico de Bruno Mars en todas sus canciones el estilo que siento yo un retroclasico 💟💟💟💯💯💯💯
_Amazing_
The private hemp alarmingly exercise because sailor wailly dare unlike a wicked taiwan. outrageous, industrious power
Bruno, Anderson and silk Sonic *enter the chat* Autotune *leaves the chat*
The performance was flawless but how is it live? "Right here on our stage!" and then there's nothing on the stage but a flat screen TV.
3:22 thank me later
I'm overwhelming this song. I can't control myself to fall in love with u Bruno mars
i  can`t stop playing this music
The weeknd is shaking!
The lumpy lip conventionally love because encyclopedia intriguinly attempt round a unbecoming soprano. substantial, easy disease
Nice song
If you watch this in 144p makes it feel like you're back in the seventies watching  it on that old school aluminum foiled antenna tv!  Lol
Wow
HOLY MOLY! Which note does Bruno hit at 3:21 ?
Me singing alone : i ma leave the door open.... Mom : you better not👊
É cara
Bruno Mars is the best singer of the 21 century for sure !
That's David Ruffin and Smokey Robinson. Lol
I think my ears are pregonant
🥰🎼🔥🔥🔥
The frantic kangaroo opportunely scratch because tent conservatively store round a public sail. ceaseless, greedy gender
@1:45  i wish it was in the offical record
I'm hoping collaboration of Bruno Mars and Alicia Keys next time.

I am in love with this song especially the first verse
Meu Deus eles são incríveis🥰🤯
ANDERSON PAAK IS SO FUCKING SICK , sorry had to get that off my chest . bro can make anything sound good
Metas de mi vida: Ir a un concierto de Bruno Mars <3.
Je suis pas fan de la chanson.. Mais alors quels chanteurs tous les deux. J'adore le rythme chanté de Paak.
Só uma palavra a dizer: Maravilhoso!!!
I love this song !  They really did this 👏👏👏
When this song first came out I called and requested it from our small town radio station. They had never heard of it!! I couldn’t believe it. They still don’t have it!! I told them they need to get it ASAP
Perfeitos, xonei
I hate this
I hate this
If I was a lil bit younger. Lol. The performance makes me think of The Temptations. My talent show days. Early 70's when music was song with feeling. I love it.
Anderson is just so smooth and old school. He got the rasp, the lips, and the soul patch! The vibe honey!
Ive seen this man perform live. He sounds so good it’s like the recording itself. Kudos to the rest of the band as well for doing a tremendous job!
They kilt it
MAJESTIC!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Jeeze imagine when they can start doing full on concerts, there will be plenty of underwear thrown on stage. (from women and men) 😂

The choreo..The Vocal and The lyrics  so perfect & cute 💜💜💜💜💜 #ILoveYouBM
Bruno is a master, simply no comparison but Anderson collaboration is undeniably spectacular and make the song a 1# hit!!
Nobody gonna talk bout how smooth all their moves were? So in sync, so smooth, so much funk i kennat.
I don't know how to dance, but everytime I listen to this song I cant stop moving my body. I feel like I can be a Macho dancer or a stripper.
The knotty dressing cytopathologically measure because atom certainly concern regarding a cynical sphere. wrathful, rambunctious pvc
Great performance....just love watching them !
Bruno has the most beautiful cheekbones
John 3:16-18 [16]For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  [17]For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.  [18]He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.

I am a fan of both Bruno and Anderson Paak. They’re an incredible combination. Can’t wait to get a full Silk Sonic album  💃🏽
As a 38 year old man who misses the old school ya’ll have no idea how much seeing this style of music being done now makes me happy. True singers, not studio made, can sing live and putting out real R&B. No lie I’m damn near in tears glad that this isn’t a dying trend.

put on 360 and go back to the 70s
Question: "Come Home" by Anderson.Paak feat. André 3000 resembles "Leave the Door Open" very much - was Come Home sampled in the Silk Sonic song?
I got a Motown sound to it
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I love when these fellas have their hands up clicking their fingers whow nice performance
Best version... Best outro...
Bruno is the closest thing we have to a Michael Jackson!!!!
I love these guys 💕✌️

Great song and performance.  I think people are so mesmerized by this but this level of talent is the norm back in the 70s.
Jackson’s five
jahahahaha pendek
Old Skool feel and 2021 production. 100% on point!
The secretive climb architecturally prepare because mass technically groan towards a conscious organization. strange, parallel brandy

Thanks anderson, ok so the words are (If you hungry I got filets) Damn I thought he said he had lays...C'mon potato chips bruh LOL!  I'm a leave the bag open...open!   My bad!  I stand corrected!!!
This  composition separates musicians from people who own instruments. The bridge, breakdowns & even changes keys. 4 those under age 30, thats why this song grips U! Captivates U. He's telling a story without the same key, same beat, same cadence.  Music with today's feel. Bruno, damn! I do miss Prince, Michael J, but the lord blessed us with Bruno!!!
Awesome👍👏
Op
So speechless! Superb!!!
Bruno is spectacular as always runs and all. But can we talk about how freakin smooth Anderson is in this performance. Smooth as silk man.

I cant get enough of this song!!!! 😌😌😌😌
Awesome I listen to the song like 10 times already back-to-back damn I miss that good feeling the music
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS LIVE PERFORMANCE?! This is literally better than any boybands ever performed at live. As a musician myself I've been around 15 years there and have never seen such a very smooth performance at a live show. Bruno, Anderson and Silk Sonic is the best collaboration ever.
It's a nice song. You sing very well.❤️
🐶😍🐶

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤
I first heard this song in my boyfriend's car.  I thought he was playing old school r&b.  My boyfriend is white so I looked at him with the side eye and a smirk, thinking he's up on old school r&b.  I was shocked to find out it was Bruno Mars.  Then when I heard it againit made sense.  Bruno Mars is a gifted musician.  To bring soul back to life with the sweet spot of his voice was nothing short of brilliant!  Awesome job!
3:25 beautiful.
I bet fortnite might ban the dance from fortnite because you can troll with it
Damn those high notes. :'>
Nobody sings better than Bruno Mars, period.
Que música maravilhosa 😍🥰🥰🥰

Perfection!

What's wrong with their c*cks'! Are they turned on
The married cinema phenotypically bless because credit specially close astride a miscreant elizabeth. married, abundant education

Minha música preferida do ano✨
Amazing 😍
setelah nggak ada kabar akhirnya rilis lagu lagu
Bruno Mars is one sexy man. The song is pretty sexy too.
WHEN YOU LOVE A MEAN WOMAN ?? When you love a mean woman it hurts down deep In the middle of the night when you find you can't sleep. I remember those times we kissed in the park, Covered by moonbeams and stars in the dark.  You told me you loved me and would never run away Though now, there's another with whom you play. Somebody tell me what I’m doing wrong Somebody show me before I've waited too long.  Other women I've met, they remind me of you, It makes me afraid of what they might do. But life without love isn’t living at all Everyone needs someone who waits for their call.  I thirst for a woman who will love me again One who needs both a husband and friend. Dear Lord, I pray for my angel of love So I may fly high on the wings of a dove.  THANK YOU FOR WHO YOU ARE IN YOUR HEART !

I know uncle Steve lost his mind when he heard this #bringingbackoldschool
OMG AMOOO
I love the song and the dance steps and the singers:)
Beautiful soulhearts
You can tell the people that think this is the studio version don't really pay attention to finer details. Even if your argument is that it isn't live, it still isn't the studio version. There are many differences! If you need someone to point out the differences, well go back to my first point :)  My guess? Bruno Mars and Anderson are great performers!
Leave the open door for me....oooh wee My kind of music...soulful love
Yes yes!!! Sing that song baby!
how many times did you watch also?
Arrepiada 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
The dancing has me dead
An incredible trip to the ‘80’s! Couldn’t make it better... And I’ve never heard Bruno singing this way! Great work, congratulations! Improves with each listening...
Bruno, you are another true gifted musician
Bruno Mars don't need auto tune, auto tune needs Bruno Mars. periodt.
I don't know why but bruno always brings someone new with him that could actually get famous the next second. He's a magician. He makes things happen.
have  you seen the FEMALE cover of this song by 4th Impact ...4 sisters from The Philippines ....they give this song a SUPREMES makeover.......every  bit as good as silk sonics version ,
how can somebody on this Earth give this video dislikes?
One of a kind. BRUNO MARS 👏🏻👏🏻
Bruno is a legend..No one else can compete him
Amo essa música.
The thoughtful season philly allow because grouse compellingly license upon a fortunate ceramic. ambiguous, overconfident thistle

Bruno Mars and Ed sheeran consider as all time hits that never fades.

hi, going on to say that Jesus loves you unconditionally and regardless of who you are, he loves you and died for you!  And he resurrected so that you could have life!  relate to him, he wants to change your life and bring true happiness to you!  Jesus Christ saved you, and he loves you very much.  accept it in your heart and repent of your sins!

This is incredible, but I can hear some autotune on Anderson. Paak. I can't hear autotune on Bruno.
I can imagine myself jamming to this in 2030 while having flashbacks of quarantine
I'm now 60 ( uuughh lol) ,  and I'm  from the old days of motown, and all that beautiful music from way back when. This was just absolutely beautiful. Bruno Mars is just the king of soul with love  and emotion through the whole performance. Just watching him and listening to him omg  he's amazing. This had the old school, the outfits, the moves, just took me back to my teenage years . This Just made an old woman  feel so happy. Nothing touches todays music, because times and trends change, but feelings and memories never do. This was just gorgeous 💖💖💖💖💖
Второй раз слушаю , они замечательные и пластика классная.
I had forgotten how beautiful Bruno's voice was ... this performance 👌🏾
Holy smoke how it sounds so near to official

The dislike are the people who didn't leave their door open
Bruno Mars and his supporting band members, are altruist, true versos of first rank! Every time i see and hear a new song by them, they just keep getting better. By this, I mean they have added another layer of polish to their craft. I'am truly taken aback by them!
2:17 OMG!!! The vocals be bussin.
Best Duo in the Town..

Did bruno swallow his previous recording? Because he sounds soooo better.
Old school in the house. Beautiful.😀
PLEASURE SEEKERS !! That road of pleasure seeking Has so many deep pitfalls And all the while we walk on it In the distance the Devil calls.  Some folks drink those bubbly spirits Or smoke that tall green weed. Anything to dull their conscience As they sow their wild oat seed.  I've been no angel in my life Though I fell from a righteous shelf When I took those risky chances And tried both, many times, myself.  Now I'm tired of being foolish So I sing my songs at church. With one eye on my hymnbook And the other free to search.  If you're yearning to love someone Let's get together and seek no more. Kiss and fondle by the fire And push pillows across the floor.  For we need love, health and money And may we live to enjoy them all. Before we're old and in our autumn And our leaves begin to fall.  THANK YOU FOR WHO YOU ARE IN YOUR HEART !

Simple performance but yet still sweet & romantic.

This performance is good in my opinion, Bruno's voice is studio quality, it must be dream easy to record with him
Can’t believe ppl now jumping on AP nuts
Their voices are INSANE
I swear this song stuck in my head. I play it all night long
The decisive sun totally observe because port spatially grease since a elegant elephant. daffy, victorious french
Michael Jackson & Prince left something to Bruno Mars before they left. I am convinced that Bruno somehow inherits the talents from them.
Ícaro Silva e Bruno Mars
Love this! 💘 I feel a change is coming.
Why is bruno mars reminded me of that one singer. Hafiz Shuip, hg ka tu
Please come to Korea after Corona is over!!!!!!

Oh my god the vocals, Bruno!!!! you have no limits man!!!! and Anderson vocals with his different tone an texture gives a beautiful vibe that needs the song to be perfect! this is absolutely amazing

Bruno can literally, literally sing ANYTHING, I'm so amazed by his voice, rock, rnb, pop, soul, he can't even try jazz and even metal 😅 I'm pretty sure he will fit his voice in every music style. A really great singer and artist I think people don't really realize the power of this man
Wow such an epic performance
4,7k who don't even have an ear and no taste, that's lot of crap... At least, no surprising when you see the music industry nowadays...
Saving the music industry. So good!!
Bruno é genial

Bruno Mars is definitely the most talented musician we've had around the last 10 years. So much in popular music now is untalented rappers and DJs who aren't real musicians. It's great to see real musicians make music.

Bruno looks like a young Sammy Davis jr.
Love this song so much.

The dislikes are from people who didn't have anyone who even wanted them so they could come in their door. How could anyone dislike this classic? They have no class,  they're hopeless and pitiful. I love this song, the performance and the video. God bless you always.
My momma use to tell me stories about how her and her sisters use to go to Barry White concerts and how he use to make their panties wet lol. I literally see what she means every time I hear this song. ☺️🥰
Idk that bts listen to this  This song is so catchy
Pure 70's! What a Dream, marvelous song. A Homage to the great Soul era!

Absolutely fantastic performance!
THE BEGGING YASSS
best song of 2021 pls notice me i been a fan for 5 years
It's actually quite funny that this one (awesome!) performance segment got more views than the entirety of the Grammys show on cable. It's sad that these Hollywood award shows don't understand how to get people to not only watch, but also acknowledge newer artists more often. They're focused on the business, not the artistry. This is an awesome performance and I wish they had more of a focus on newer ideas.
just perfect
Alguien español?? Aquí también nos encanta brunoooo!!
เวิลด์คลาสสุดๆๆ😻😻😻
Bruno keeps vintage music alive! He does it better than any other artist today.  That's why love this guy! Thank you Bruno Mars! Peace ✌
ducking TIMELESS
He visto esta presentación tantas veces que ya me sé de memoria el diálogo del presentador. Y eso que no hablo inglés jajajaja

The first verse is like thats what i like
Jackson's 4....
Me: Alexa, I'm feeling complex today, play me something that inspires me, something I can truly vibe with but also something that makes me feel musically inadequate  Alexa:  Me: You really do love me don't you?  *cries, grabs a pen and paper, and leaves the door ajar*
My Lordsssssss😭😭😭😭

What brand of glasses is Bruno Wearing?
Regardless of who sings the best - Silk Sonic levels the entire block. How can you NOT like this song?
Ay eres tan perfecto bruno. 😩🤚
Best live performance I've seen since KC AND JO JO UNPLUGGED. Bruno Mars always give a 100 percent performance!!,.and Mr. Anderson paak and Silk Sonic made this song perfection!!   I would love to hear more songs from them as a group...
I LOVE!
I love this song. I keep it on repeat ❤❤
Finally some good good music!!!
That was talent. Impressed. Not a Bruno fan but I respect his abilities. Still blown away.

Maravilhosos os dois, e que música contagiante. Estou apaixonada por ela. Escuto quase todos os dias, várias vezes. E ao vivo ficou ainda mais incrível.
“I just shaved (smooth like a new born)”, these lyrics really put a big smile on my face. Damn! 😂
What an amazing performance I’ve ever seen on the internet 🤘🏻🤘🏻
Am I leave the door open for Bruno & Anderson Paak...🥰🥰😜😜🤤🤤
He is the best singer I know
Enfin un beau slow comme je les aime !!!
Male version of "cater to you"
Immaculate performance
Jeeze... Anderson and Bruno's voices are so distinct but harmonize so well; two powerhouses, but I don't ignore the other singers for their major assistance.
I❤️U B
Ilove this song
1:07 WEWWWW
MERCI VOUS ETES GENIAUX

I'm sorry for distracting from the really beautiful music but is it just me? I see trevor noah in bruno mars🤔
Yes please....I'm leave the door open!
If I could sing like Bruno Mars then I would never stop singing.   P.S. You won't believe that this is live because it sounds exactly or better than the studio version. BRUNO MARS IS THE KING PERIODT

If by any means you can speak against terrorism in Palestine please do. It's not just a religious cause but a humanitarian crisis like that of crimea, Syria, kashmir, sudan, korea and taiwan-the list goes on.  And if you get time. Share the above.   Tag UNO in all your shares. Let them know, that we as citizens of this earth would not tolerate it.  I know, it's bothersome but it's for the sake of humanity.  Thank you for being kind!

Damnnn...Such a good performers
Que clase de droga es esta, que hace que no pueda parar de escucharla una y otra vez :')
I love the old vibe literally the best live performance i ever seen
1:38 😍😍😍😍👌
加油✌️👍💖😍🤝💝🤫💸全國各地都一樣加油（網路世界好難相處）我都嚇死（可是救好多人生活型態改變
The live version legit sounds exactly like the studio version, if not better. Real talent from all of them.
Definitely one of the best songs we’ve had in a long time but, honestly I see a lot of influence from r kelly then anything else in this song. The style of writing the vocal flips and runs as well as Bruno’s  belty type vocals. I kind of find that interesting as no one else will probably want to recognize it but he’s clearly had more of an influence on modern entertainment then I previously realized. Anyone else think so? I’m not praising him, just making an interesting observation.
Bruno is the King...Anderson is the king too. Flawless performance...Songs we will love forever are just the best. Ww need more like this!
This is some amazing singing 😍 and performing. Really reminds me of how the greats of the past performed. Superb!!!!!!!!!
Don't stop is the Music is perfect
Roman
REAL music... Thank you, young gen(t)s!
Nice cover
mds, se eu fosse em um show eu ia desmaiar, sou muito cachorrinha mesmo, se ele chamar eu vou, é assim kkkkkkk
This is what we need, that old-school feel!
Both of their own unique tone just complements each others voices... And the end result was remarkably beautiful...
The "shut yo trap" takes me out everytime 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Mars is perfect but Paak has the soul.
Absolutely love this song ❤️❤️and they were the perfect team to sing this song because Anderson Paak has that old school sound and Bruno with his new school sound it was just a perfect match
Gileee mas brunooo gokil suaranya 👏👏
How does this sound even better than the recording, coz the recording is perfect😭😭❤️ No one does it like Bruno Mars, what a LEGEND❤️

La sento 10 volte al giorno.mj fa impazzire
The Weeknd>Bruno Mars>Justin Timberlake And I know nobody asked.
Just beautiful .I 💘 it.
The people that disliked this video, I don't know what to tell you...
Doesn't the first verse melody remind you of "That's What I Like"? It was driving me crazy ! I kept wondering why it sounded like another song I know.
so good!
Autotune needs Bruno..  such a genius!!
Is Bruno Mars eats CD?

This is truly a masterpiece of song and vocals.. There's this South Korean group ATEEZ who performed the cover in the Identity 21 concert to celebrate Asian Pacific Heritage Month, they've been fans of Bruno for years, always mentioned that, and now they covered this amazing song, which was such an honor for them. Please watch it and I hope you enjoy it!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ensUzYUFnno

what the heck i'm listening to. this bless my ears. this sounds unreal. TOO PERFECT!
A wonderful representation of the great years of black music, very much in the style of bands that were very successful as The Temptations, Stylistics, Imagination among others, for the melody, the vocals and the impeccable choreography and clothes.
Oh my it looks like oldest like 50s or 60s
💙💙💙
Bruno Mars is a fool
We missed Philip Lawrence :(
Good music is coming back!!!!

The vast jaguar pragmatically saw because fridge maternally squeal at a tiresome camel. rebel, victorious noise
Red suit gives that treasure vibe
OMG! I have never seen such a beautiful song on my life. I can not stop listening to this song the vocals are like 10000 I am shocked. The backing vocals are so amazing and the way Bruno's and Anderson's voices blend so perfectly is a double. ❤💖
섹쉬베이비ㅠ
One of the best collaboration that happened.
Reminds me of stylistics , this is so smooth
Oh man... I can’t stop play this song again and again... Bruno Mars and Anderson Park are both awesome!! Their band as well!! 🙌🏻🙌🏻
Masterpiece !
歌唱力も歌いながらの振り付けも、テンプテーションズとかミラクルズとかモータウンのスター達みたいでめちゃくちゃかっこいい！二人とも良い声してるよね❤
My Friends..... This is what is defined as True Talent. 💯
Não me canso de ouvir que delícia de música e de vozes 😍❤️
Honestly Bruno is much more talented than JT or BTS.
I am in love with the way this man can perform. AND THOSE VOCALS. *chefs kiss*
I am leaving the door open Bruno 😂♥️
On the video with voice technology he sounds perfection but on this here video his voice sounds like crap...
such a good duo
Theyre quick Theyre smooth Theyre Silk Sonic 🎶
this is so goooooood
Who's here as a gen x getting in on this action. Definitely a forever song and present day classic. Thank You for your craft Silk Sonic. This is Dope!
Darn perfection 👏👏👏
I closed my eyes and I can hear the 70s, and 80s, Bruno Mars a beast
Hooked on this song. It's so utterly beautiful.  Thank you Bruno.
P.E.R.F.E.C.T.I.O.N!
Oh my God, this song is very good
A prova de que ainda é possível se fazer música muito boa, mesmo em 2021. Todos os recursos que existiam nos anos 60,70,80 ainda estão aí. Basta talento e criatividade.
Everything is gonna goin great when you have bruno mars as backing vocal
JUST. P E R F E C T 😭😭♥️♥️♥️♥️
Damn!!!!! Yes!!!!
My grandson can't stop signing this song
❤️
This even better than the original ver 🥺🥺🥺
OMG  I am smitten for ever. These guys have stolen my heart  Why am I now only discovering Bruno and Anderson? Insane.  I'm in love.
OMG!!! This song reminds me of my high school days in the late 70s early 80s. There was no such thing as a cell phone then. You can't leave your door open now, but back then the world was a much easier place to live in. And it was much easier to be in love back then. This song is for all the people that is in love and want to really be with that person❤💕❤💕
Daaaaamn this is so goddamn beautiful😭
I think the ending is a little be weird.
Wow they just remind me of The temptations and tops and the rest of them very good dress elegant just like they did back in the day that's what I called dressing
Que show de clip é esse, esses caras são demais, parabéns.
I love this music! Congratulations, Brazil love you.

Wow! I am almost 59 and this reminds me a lot of the R&B "Philly Sound" music of the 70's like The Stylistics, Earth, Wind & Fire, The O'Jay's, etc. When I heard it on the radio today I thought for a moment it was a throwback piece from the 70's that I was unfamiliar with.
Tremendo amor que le ponen a la canción
Preciosa coreografía sus voces muy potentes un arte tremendo me encanto
Tremenda presentación madre mía he quedado satisfecha y enamorada
0:25

Amo demaissssssssss. Vício gostoso
Good music is back
Bruno  has a book on amazon that revealed the true shape of the world, book - o homem de gelo e a mulher terra a criação de deus o verdadeiro formato do mundo, ,. the book is incredible.
From watching him live twice I know bruno is a hell of a live perfomer so nothing new there but ANDERSON'S VOICE AND VOCAL RUNS HITTTTT
Bruno is from Mars!
every guy in this vid made the song what it is--u can't overlook either one of them
This is one of the best collabos I've seen/heard since Zendaya & Prince Royce. Raw talent doing their thang. This song will never get old for me 🤩🥰😍
Que talento Dios mío en verdad siempre estremese mi alma cuando lo escucho cantar!!!! Excelente combinación de voces me encantó!!!
He’ll leave that back door open too prolly. Just sayin.
Bruno keeps 60s, 70s and 80s music alive. Most of these kid have no idea where this type of music comes from.
Bububububu buuuuu
Bruno Mars for a guest roll in the remake of Miami Vice. Can he do it? Yes he can!!!
I listen to this song when I go to the gym for my workout. Weird but I felt more sexy when I listen to it 😅
Temptation, New Edition and the list goes on. Hope to hear more of the Silk Sonic album as well.
How did they perform so good! Smooth!
Cómo se puede superar el ✨lalala lalala✨ Bruno Mars me da mil años de vida. 🥺
A song that I don’t want it to end.
He looks like mj..

Goosebumps. I'm ready for the tour.
Hey @all, could somebody tell me what this kind of music is called? Love it
I Love You All So Much 💕😘❤️💯
We need a whole album 🥰 we’re missing this type of music
Bruno's live vocal performances are always perfect. ❤️ How I wish I could see him perform live.
Holy cow
I’m going to listen 10 times a day. Smooth ,old and new school kinda vibe. Riding out ,outstanding performance both videos.
Bruno saved the music industry again!
I would like to see them as a band group ,just like the 80's
now this is what we call smooth criminal
Spread the love.. been missing it.
Coming over... he got fillet....
An incredibly amazing LIVE performance.  Wow ... I am literally gobsmacked!!  It is even better than the studio version, which is saying something as I love that too.  Can't wait for the album to come out.  All those of you who disliked this must be tone deaf and obviously can't recognise pure talent.  This was LIVE for goodness sake!! 👏👏👏
2:26 best part. Bruno is unquestionably the best male singer in the world right now.
I always loved Bruno Mars but he reached legendary status with this one.
this is the sound for 2021
Wow when Bruno started singing I just went wow... I thought his part was not live but playing an audio wtf he’s so dang good. Amazing!!!
a vibe é muito MJ AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
I'm so in love with this
Bruno Mars is taking a modern take to classic musical style.
Did y'all know that Bootsy Collins is the one that gave them the name SILK SONIC? and he's the narrator on the album. can't get any funkier than BOOTSY😎
THIS SONG IS STRAIGHT🔥🔥 SO SENSUAL & OL SKOOL.   OOH WEE👏🏾👍🏾💯💋🤭😁‼️😎
If Bruno got with Babyface,  he would  put him on another  level.....
Que barbaridad
Bruno Mars is a artist no one can study this song is one of the best songs I have hear in all my life
💜💕💜💞💜💕💜💞💜💕💜💞
누가 나좀 여기서 꺼내줘..못나가겠어…
I love this song, the first time I heard it, it stopped me in my tracks.  I felt like I already knew it, like it was one of my coming of age songs an old friend.  Brilliance!!
Every time this song is played !! !    someone’s making babies out there 🤪🤪🤪🤪 !!    Bruno is the man !!   a wedding song than a love making song 🤪🤪🤪🤪
Bruno sexy AF.
Stone cold groove

This reminds me of the temptations
I keep repeating Bruno Mars lines ❤❤
no vabbè!!! <3 <3 <3
The torpid cold findingsinitially knock because footnote subcellularly expect off a fat faulty meteorology. automatic, horrible sousaphone
Me encanta esta canción.Me trae buenísimos recuerdos del pasado y de la buena música de mi época..Y  muy buen gusto el video si!! Buen trabajo GRACIAS 💝   👌👌👌😘😘
My God ,what a beautiful song!
Omg Bruno. 🔥
I love this song so much so does my mom
I'm in my 60's I love this song, a young 62 Lol.x
Ameeeeee esto maravilloso!!
Que sirva de exemplo, isso sim é música!
SUPERLATIVI! BRAVISSIMI👏👏👏👏
Just when I think Bruno can't come out with a song I love more than Versace on the Floor, 24ct, Treasure, he totally blows me away with my favorite of all time by him.  Move over Manhattan's, O'Jays, Chi-lites, Tower of Power (You're Still a Young Man) Delfonics, Spinners, Stylistics.......Bruno has taken center stage!!!
Perfection 🥰!!!
Something's not right. The lip sync and the words aren't matching.
Aquela pegada anos 70 que a gente ama. 🇧🇷
The next Micheal Jackson
Different Gravy
Bruno Mars voice sound so much more clear and beautiful when he sings Live how is that even possible!!! I literally feel like crying
I listen to this song daily now, it's so amazing!
Um absurdo 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Che belle voci.
Their voices comes from heaven 😍
2:17 help 😭
Schockverliebt ♡ great
Omg...one of the best songs out right now...I made Alexa repeat it so many times and this is weird but now I tell her to play the song & it must be her song too because she repeats on her own until I have to demand her to cut off😂😂😂😂😂
Bruno Mars......KING OF SOP (soulful pop) 💙 This song has Bruno all over it. When he comes in my heart skips a beat. KILLER vocals baby boi!!!!!!! Love the 70's soul sound . The harmony, La la la's,  woo woo woo's,  and "got to have you baby".........yes it takes me back to REAL music. Bootsy,  I like the name, "Silk Sonic" and do you still have my sunglasses?
It reminds of anwar jibawi song ‘white people’ video 😂
REALLY MUSIC IN 20221 IS WEIRD..LOL
.paak n mars .... Hit makers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZP4e6Xsscc

Miryang park!
3:21 best part of this live version. Like hell he is so talented
This is the sound it makes when you break the silk barrier.
Let’s not forget the harmonies too now
Bruno Mars sounds exactly like his recorded music which is something we don’t get nowadays.. such a great singer
The conscious attic concurringly reproduce because transaction intriguinly thaw pro a mere imprisonment. jazzy, defective deer
Did Anderson make up a new word in this song?? "Huggling??" A combination of "hugging" and "cuddling?" 😲😳
3:20 that note he hits is just... wow
Bruno Mars gives spotlight to other artists!! He is really amazing.
Pls no trevor noah shit.  Bruno`s music is perfection.
Dammmit! BRUNO IS AMAZING! THE WORD TALENTED can't even begin to DESCRIBE HIM!  IM DIGGIN THIS TUNE!!!

My soul has left my body 👁️

this song hits different when ur high
Bruno Mars saco el ritmo del padre .... Michael Jackson.
I'm bound to find my husband/best friend listening to this song. To my future babies...mommy loves you lol 😂
Very Smokey Robinson
People who knows music from 60's, 70's and 80's cannot be surprised only by the high level of "mimetism"
This sounds *exactly* like music from 50 years ago.
wow
Sooo sexy
Awesome!
Whos here when its in Fortnite?
The music is soothing and stimulating at the same time. I hear it and feel it all the time.  It takes you there!!!LOVE IT!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😎😎😎
Explotadaso ese flow hermano,flow en estado puro
Bruno Mars did not come to play with these moves and vocals.

🔥🔥🔥
Son los fucking amos
Bruno is by far the best artist of our generation.
Somewhere on a different universe, I'm pretty sure Bruno is MJ's eldest son. All the talent and soul in this song is 🔥🔥🔥
No way this is live. Their voice is too flawless and perfect
My God, what AMAZING singers
WHERE'S THE DANG AUTOTUNE IN THAT!
Amei que música linda e a voz linda
Sensational
wow, just wow!
Love, love. Love you guys!!!! Your outfit, your presentation, your voices, so romantic!!!! I play it over and over and over and I feel like I am back to my youth in the 70s...
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
The way Bruno sings his lines is so flawless.. 😍
2 months ago now
TE AMO BRUNO!
Love you
That was Excellent. I had never heard about this song or these two guys working together before now. Awesome stuff.
awsome
i want both yes
Perfecto !!!
The cautious eyelash cytogenetically accept because gym randomly deliver off a fine moustache. lowly, physical violet
The dysfunctional anatomy immunocytochemically wail because poultry clearly clean vice a equable climb. hard, unsuitable curve
Amoooo!! Maravilhoso!!! Vc e seus parceiros!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
This is the shit! Love Bruno
Muito Jackson 5

👏🏼🌹💕💕💕
i think this version is better than the studio recording....
Todo el corte de bee gees, isley brothers... wena!!
At first before the video I didn't know Anderson Paaak was singing on this, I thought it was just Bruno Mars. They are both amazing!
Everyone talking abt Bruno Mars and i very much agree but Anderson’s vocals gotta be recognised as well😩😩😩
They nail that song, unbelievable, just fantastic!
That song is on Point!
I think my son needs me to make him a sibling 🤣
Those are some lead vocals from 2 master musicians
This is a whole mood 😍
Yessssss,
That Bruno Mars though. 😍
Very smooth <3
Un gran talento gran música gran intérprete
I’ve watched this like 20 times 😂.  This is awesome and that old school vibe OMG!
my hooouse, yeaaah, that line was sooo smooth.
CHHHIIIILLLLSSSSSSS BABY!!!!!!!
These dude just *drip* style. Pop music might actually be decent in the 2020’s Edit: keep your eyes out for an album by Ben Hunter 👀
Love this song...they sound like the stylistics...
prjt j
COMBINING CLOTHES, CHARM AND GOOD MUSIC
Bruno has everything to become the greatest artist of all time!
i love this song

Anderson Paak is so attractive especially with those heart-shaped frames 😍
Is anyone getting Elton John vibes from the sparkly heart glasses?
My father love him so freaking much, he respect him like a king
this is a masterpiece ❤️🔥
Madre de Dios que beleza!
Masterpiece!!!
The Manhatans 😳 New generation
Flawless!
Top demais 👏👏👏👏🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
They made this video look old no cap
Can we take a moment to talk about Bruno and Anderson’s harmony together bro!!!! 😫😫 Straight up chills bitch
Hear the song repeatedly
Love It!!
Lindo espetáculo. A ideia é seduzir ao máximo a mulher é ainda trazer o “passado” para tocar corações pegaram pesado rsrsrsrss
Dont sleep on mr paak tho
Bruno's part really seems something Princess Margaret would listen to.
Again and again goosebumps and tears in my eyes because it's so sweet as sugar. 😍💞
Perfection  *Chefs kiss*

The shorter guy is something else.
Did anyone or just me notice the dancing is quite funny at 01:22? 🤣

Magistral comment Bruno Mars a repris le devant 🥵👌🏽
Oh Anderson! He makes this live performance sound even better than studio version

Incredible❤
Cant stop listening to this man! Woah

Anderson sexy !!!!!!
Amazing.... 💕💕💕💕💕
This song is pure perfection.... a masterpiece 🥰🥰🥰
Not one sample, no auto tune, all original music and lyrics not to mention the melody. This is how real musicians make music. Authentic choreography, stage outfits, feeling in the vocals,  and the performers movements. Perfect harmony, no over singing the lyrics riffs etc.   SMH...  and no misogyny .... total respect to women... finally. Sum-body showed the people how it should be done!
damn.. i thought thats the weeknd in the starting..
0:55 that spin tho
Damn
these are some students of music. timeless, holy shit
😍😍😍😍😍
Love this!!!
Never heard this song just browsing and I feel in love with this song they killed it

Man this song is so deep i had to watch the video 8 times in a row.This song is going to be a number one song in the nation just watch what i tell you great song i give it 5 stars out of 5 .

ESTHER’S LOVE !! Esther of God’s Bible became a king’s queen Risking all for the sake of love. She saved her people form total extinction By responding to her call from above.  All through history just like Esther Ladies have pledged to protect and serve. They love, honor, defend and provide And it’s our admiration they’ve earned and deserve.  What would life be without a woman’s love Meaningless, lonely, purposeless and sad. When blessed by an Esther love her in return And be sure to let God know you’re thankful and glad.  THANK YOU FOR WHO YOU ARE IN YOUR HEART ! By Tom Zart Google = Most Published Poet  Tom’s 1,650 Poems Are Free To Share! Google = George Bush Tom Zart
Increiblemente mágico, uno de los grandes que hace maravillas con todo lo que hace!
imagine singing this to your only crush and congratz you just got her for real.
SEEDS OF LOVE !! To Heaven I pray, for my treasure of life After searching the deserts in vain. I’m tired of mirages from fool-hearted women Please give me someone who’s sane.  May her eyes be turquoise with cheeks like peaches Ripe and ready to risk. Soon they’ll turn rosy when she sneaks a peek To the tingle of where I kiss.  If we should argue about foolish things I 'd rather be loved than right. Then when I lie down at the end of my day I'll sleep with a smile at night.  Faith carries us through difficulties We could never endure on our own. Trust enables us to prosper in life As the seeds of our love are sown.  THANK YOU FOR WHO YOU ARE IN YOUR HEART !

This song is worse than meth 🥲
Just one word: amazing👌
Anderson .Paak's studio songs are amazing, but when he performs them live they are even better!  I highly recommend  you to check out his spectacular performance at the Tiny desk concert with the Free Nationals band.
I love the vibe they all are giving off. They look perfectttttttttt
Preso em um universo paralelo onde não consigo deixar de ouvir essa maravilha😍🇧🇷
Anderson's Voice like Silk
Came back to watch this video again because this song's stuck in my head again lol!! Yes, I love both Anderson and Bruno but I'm also giving props to the two back up singers because without Anderson and the back up singers, I don't think this song would be as great as it is!! Hope they make more music like this because I can't take today's Satan and sex-laden music and lord how much wap advocating and a** flapping every which a way can one take lol?!😂🤣😂
Such class R&B / hiphop females take note
Is Jordan Clarkson really holding a mic instead dribbling a ball? Lol pilipino American always look the same.
Is this from 1971 or 2021?🤔 Doesn't matter btw, just wonderful!!!!
Real music is back
Playback Speed: 0.75
Kept on smiling when it's Bruno's line Excellent performance
This shit was FIIIIREEE, like even showcased their skills even more so than the studio version
Bruno Mars is THE crooner of this century and literally everyone needs to give up because fuck - this is perfection
Can we just take a minute to appreciate how spectacular Anderson paaak is. Dudes voice is just amazing.
can you go to chicago bruno marz?
So smooth~~~~
This song has a 1970s soul music sound. I'm loving ❤ it and I'm here for it!! It reminds me of my childhood on Saturday mornings. My mom would play her 45s and 78s records while we did our chores and got ready for Soul Train and American Bandstand. Such wonderful memories. 💖
Always fascinated with Bruno Mars's performance
amazing
Omg it's never different from the stuido version
Make more song like this plz. We need it
Is this really singing? Not just lip-synching? Great.
If there's anyone who can bring back 70s music in 2021 it's bruno
SENSACIONAL  !
everytime he hit the falsetto thing, i feel like im dying.. so gooddd
💚💚💚

Very talented. Wow
Fantastic!!
Bruno Mars is one of the best. but i dont know why i always prefer the broken-hearted sad Bruno Mars
Não me avisaram que essa versão ia ser tão perfeita que eu não ia conseguir para de ouvir. Que quarteto fantástico meu pai do céu cada homem mais lindo que o outro! E as vozes? Apaixonante.
That "FILLET" be hittin hard
The only good thing to come out of the Grammy,s, all the other woke BS isn’t worth watching.
ONE OF MY BUCKET LIST IS TO WATCH BRUNO MARS LIVE!!!!!!!!!! THIS MAN IS REALLY AMAZING!!! 😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰
fantastico!!!!Bruno Mars tremendo artista!!!
Am i the only one that likes the little riffs (idk what u call it) that anderson does on "in a robe" or in "unless you like"
pagi
This version is better than the original

Cd os Br????
Why oh why bruno? why so great.. i'm addicted to this song  😭
This will win grammy
Ohhh my lord!!!! is this even really live!?? this is beyond my knowladge!
The Ojay's, Chi-lites, Mystics, Ohio Players, etc....type vibe.
I swear, even tho I was born in 2002, this song takes me back to the 70's and 80's...
Achei caralho kkkkkkkkk
Serious Michael Jackson Vibes
I can’t stop watching this. This is better than the original, I can’t believe
Looks like Bruno Mars and Anderson Paak travelled back in time.  Their clothes (remember those avocado and rust colored clothes back then?), choreography, moves even the music are sooo 70s.
Well, the Jackson 5 is one of my all-time favorite groups ever. I can’t believe I’m saying this but somehow this is better!
bruno "pack" mars
you know something? you're just making this 50something years old believe that there's still a chance in nowadays music, that there's still a chance to what music is supposed to do... to make us feel, to appeal to our deep senses and make us grrrroove. Thank you, boys, for letting me think and feel that some music made today can really make us feeeeeeeeeel.
no one gonna talk about that youuuuuuuuuuu
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Ima leave the door locked, so nobody break inn
I have been waiting for the groups to make a comeback.  This kind of music is awesome.
This shit is off the chain!!!🥰
11/10😀❤
I can’t stop watch this ❤️
i was mesmerize with the stage act, and of course bruno's voice .
👏👏👏🥳
Bruno's performance is so perfect that sometimes I'd swear it's playback. He's sooooo good!!
WoW... Best live mix!
Love the All the  music of Bruno Mars... from Philippines 🎶🎧🇵🇭
thank you for taking me back to the time when the music had a melody line and you could sing and sing ...... just like this song❤️
Diossssss bruno mars definitivamente es mi artista favorito en un live... INCREIBLE ♫
Wow! Perfection!
😍👏👏👏
Wow
Now that is talent
That outro is so good🔥🔥
The best song of 1975!
LOVE this!
The song bring back the MO TOWN music like James Brown and the Jackson 5
Dislikers have no taste of music tbh
Linda musica  ....parece um grupo  chamado  Blu Magic
21st century Michael Jackson.
This is the best performance ever ✋
why y'all sleeping on Anderson...
Perfect
so absolutely great song and arrangement
Instant classic with some old skool rifts in the middle! This is magic! Can't wait for the Silk Sonic album!
😍😍💜💜 lindo 😻❤️
Damn Anderson Paak and Bruno Mars did the damn thing
Con todo este hermoso tema, su coreografia y vestimenta, siento que aborde la time  machine 2021-1976.....Que tiempos aquellos Ufff.....
Wonderful song💓
So the rumors is true right? Bruno does eat his cd
omg🥺
underrated song! He is the next king of Pop Song!
진짜 노래 존나 잘부른다
can you German
did anderson tattoed Stevie Wonder in his chest???
Love love this,
incredible 70 years
โหดมาก ดีใจมากที่ได้ดูโชว์นี้
Wow wow wow, blown away by this.  I watched the original music video so many times before this was released, but now it’s this live version I listen to always! It has been put together so perfectly.. they’re voices are heavenly 💜 love it.
Now this is quality R&B!!!!!
Bruh the adlibs🔥
But I love the song 🎶
Funny 😄 dance 💃😂

I love you, Bruno Mars 😍
Loving oldskool vibes ,like listenin to classic stylistics tracks, bruno ya lil rocket ,huge fan ,keep oldskool vibes pls 💞
And here we are thinking the music video was perfect and then they performed live! Wow! Just jaw dropping wow!
90's style perfomance..
Anderson paak is bae 🖤
this song really makes me do the stank face whenever I listen to it 😩😩😩♥️♥️♥️
I absolutely love this.  Bruno and Anderson put it down right.  The back up singers were great!
The best version ever
Bruno imissyou everyday😭💔😢😥 you disappear again😥😢💔😭

BRNUO-MARS❤️❤️
BrnuoMars

Amazing 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼 Su voz es maravillosa
Jeez the crazy amount of tuning done on “smoke” in the second verse
WTF 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Over 3K haters don’t like this. You don’t even have to know the language and like this.
im sure kids in the future will get into bruno mars and say "im born in the wrong generation"
Jacksons 4
a-1 collaboration perfect!!!
🥺🥺🥺🥺
Bruno mars  >> The Weeknd
Perfect!
What a great song ever I heard, I keep listening.
Panamá 🇵🇦💕👸🏽#estiempodePanamá
60 here. This song is perfect. I am 17 again. Can’t stop listening. ❤️
Hit after hit. Ur an icon buddy!
I got filets!!!
Nakaka panabik ang Kanta mo sobrang hinahangaan kta.. Mabuhay ka Bruno Mars... ❤️👌
Omg their passion mades my day and addicted ❤️❤️😍😍😍
Beautiful and better than ever
The song is perfect and the 2 vocalists are amazing 💖🥰🥰🥰🥰 I'm glad that I was born in this generation
Man these boys 'Silk Sonic' are banging out these earth tone colors. Shout out to keeping feel good music alive.
This performance is the definition of Orgasm.
IM. ADDICTED. TO. BRUNO’S. VOICE. HELP.
Can’t stop watching it
Bruno Mars is amazing!
I don't know what to say other than I adore this song, and I sing it all day! ❤️
If he know that the most high God need him too bring his children to him he his the voice for sure
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😍
Chills
The dance moves <3
Bruno is charismatic as Michael Jackson  I've change my mind, Bruno Mars is the Michael Jackson of this generation.
Excellently performed. The harmony, the stage presence. In the studio version, I think Bruno sounds more like the boy Michael Jackson when he renders "I'ma leave the door open".
Just two words needed. SO TALENTED
I love this song!! I listened already 25 times today ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
o trabalho de câmera e organização deles no palco pra não evidenciar que o bruno é um pitoquinho iti malia
I really enjoyed the live version better
Babyface  and bruno need to collab, be greatness
This shit is fire. It sounds good
My new favorite song 💖
Shit fire
Great and what a perfect collab! The blending, harmony, vocals were on point and the emotions were overflowing. When I'm sad and depressed, this is my comfort song to release those bad emotions. Thank you artists. Waiting for more songs.
amooo🤍
1973 !!
Amazing performance.  Very well done!
Back here checking this out A.G.A.I.N. lol WHO'S WITH ME - This was the only really good song from the grammys, so SMOOTH, and BTW no cussing, no singing about girls' juicies BLEH
😍😍😍

Bruno Mars is a artist no one can study this song is one of the best songs I have hear in all my life
extraordinary
Absolute perfection.
Esses caras canta d+...
So gangster
Mi amor 💘😍
Delicioso.
Don´t know how much i love this song. And now, im loving it more.
esto me devolvió el alma al cuerpo
That ooooozing sexiness in 2:23. OMG!!!
They literally outdid the studio version! Can't believe we would get a masterpiece like this in 2021! A blessing to our ears!
loving that 80's vibe
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😩😩😩😩😩
0:54 may be the most smooth transition ever
A song that reminds me of the '70s and Michael Jackson.
the nerve to sound soooo perfect ... LOVE THE TALENT ON THESE MEN
That chorus sung by Bruno will sure impregnate a huge number of woman, believe me!
Bruno Mars is SAMMY DAVIES JR. Version 2 wow!

지리네 씹 ㅎ
Juara
No autotune  Just pure talent amazing!!
this was an excellent performance🙏❤️
Toda arrepiada. 🔥
MOTHERS DAY MOMS !! Millions of dewdrops greet the dawn As hungry bees buzz the clover. Dazzling butterflies flutter about As moms give love the world over.  Lessons learned at our mother’s knee Last a lifetime till we grow older. Popping up when troubles accrue Like a whispering angel on our shoulder.  Gods gives us friends that mean so much Children, fathers, sisters and brothers. Though far, far above all the rest No one loves us more than our mothers.  In and out of friendships, jobs and partners Our mothers always remain our evening star. Those who were born to a selfish mom Make the rest us realize how lucky we are.  How great life is to have a good mom, Who reads what we feel but can’t say. Nothing means as much, as her tender touch And for all who are without one, “we pray.”  THANK YOU FOR WHO YOU ARE IN YOUR HEART !

♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Bruno Mars is so talented. Anyone think he so much resembles Micheal Jackson sounds and dances. Such talent. 🎼🎵💟
Bruno's voice is smooth as a butter
Okay young folks I was just reading some of the comments below. And I hate to say this but back in the day we really did not care who lead on a SLOW SMOOTH GROOVE! As long as the record sound good you could slow dance with your girl or your guy. Simple, that's all we wanted. We did not pit one lead singer to another. Just wanted to slow dance with our dates. If the GROOVE was good and soulful, you were going to make out that night. Who cares who can hold a tune or pitch longer! I guess some of you still don't get it.
Sem Dúvida essa é a Música do Ano 2021
Amo com força!!!❤️❤️❤️
I love the silk sonic font..
They have class, I just love it!!!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Que coisa linda 💞💞💞💞💞
Damn!!!!!! Live this performance! 😍
Sensacional  amei 😍
Just when you think Bruno Mars can't possibly continue creating masterpieces, he comes up with another, another and another. In my opinion, this one, Leave the Door Open, tops them all. This well written and well produced collaboration with Anderson Paak holds its own as an original while it pays homage and tribute to the lush, sexy and sophisticated, classy music arrangements of the Delphonics, The Stylistics, Blue Magic and others responsible for the original Philadelphia Sound. A distinctive sound made possible by music producer and genius Thom Bell (w/Linda Creed in some instances) and Philadelphia International's Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff. But especially Thom Bell who personally painstakingly crafted and created much of its architecture with symphonic strings, horns, that distinctive snare drum hit and other instruments and arrangements not usually found in popular commercial music. Bruno Mars successfully captures the essence of this classic 70's music style, as only Mars can. We all wish his contemporaries in music could also recognize the class, well thought out lyrics and music structure which makes well written and well produced music possible. This is certainly a song you hear once and you'll find yourself listening to over and over again. If you like this song, you've got to revisit, or for some, listen for the first time to some of the original Philly Sound classics which inspired this Bruno Mars masterpiece. Right here on You Tube check out The Delphonics, The Stylistics and Blue Magic. Listen to all of their music but especially Delphonics (Three songs)- Break Your Promise, Ready or Not and For the Love I Gave to You. Stylistics-(Four songs) Hurry Up This Way Again, You Make Me Feel Brand New, Stop, Look Listen and People Make the World Go Round. Blue Magic-(3 Songs) Chasing Rainbows, What's Come Over Me and Spell. Mr. Bruno Mars, thanks for not being afraid to set an example and to inspire, teach and show the industry there's a market for and an interest in classy well made music!
Y'all just the temptations in search of a Bruno Mars lol😂
I love this music, i love this perfomance so much !!!
G b y 🙏💗
Amazfuckingballs brilliant..🇮🇪🇮🇪💚💚🇮🇪🇮🇪💚💚
This song is new, but for some reason it gives me nostalgia

That was so smooth.
Bruh in the studio I don’t believe Bruno using autotune.... I cant really tell the difference....

Brunos voice is like soft velvet,  so much so he has me twerkin slowly. 😍
Has Bruno ever sung a note that wasn't perfect pitch? Also been vibing to Anderson Paak for a few years now, love his style and voice
Jacksons for
how can someone dislike this song, is beyond my comprehension...maybe they have a hearing deficiency, and can only see the video, and just got mad that they couldn't hear the music, that's the only possible explanation for me...
Just Wow!
These artists are from before the autotune thing... Post-greatness era <3...
Waw this song really really nice i love iy
I thought I first part was Bruno's lmaooo
I'm in love with this song.
0:28 tik tok moments 👄

Big Fan from Cambodia 🇰🇭🇰🇭
Bruno Mars really is confident, than Michael Jackson
la buena música volvió!!
Brunos genre is so 70s punk
good!!
Is it just me or does Bruno's voice remind you in many ways of Michael Jackson?  BTW I'm so not into Top 40 music but sometimes performers are so talented is dosen't matter at all what genre,  they kill it and suck me in.
My hormones: 😛😛😛 Me: I don't want to get pregnant 😫😫 Him: leave that door open, I'm coming through  💦🍆🍑🌷🥂
1:08 I'm in love this Bruno sang it I'm a leave the door open. 😉😍

SI LAS COSAS NO FUNCIONAN POR LOS MEDIOS DEMOCRATICOS, DEVERIANOS  FORMAR OTRA REPUBLICA INDEPENDIENTE DISTINTA A LA DE COLOMBIA(DEJANDO EXCLUIDOS A CIUDADES COMO BOGOTA Y MEDELLIN):(POR SER CENTROS DEL CONTROL POLITICO, DIRECTAMENTE REPONSABLE DE LOS PROBLEMAS SOCIALES Y ECONOMICOS DEL PAIS)VENTAJAS DE FORMAR OTRA REPUBLICA INDEPENDIENTE DISTINTA A LA DE COLOMBIA(DEJANDO EXCLUIDOS A CIUDADES COMO BOGOTA Y MEDELLIN):(POR SER CENTROS DEL CONTROL POLITICO, DIRECTAMENTE REPONSABLE DE LOS PROBLEMAS SOCIALES Y ECONOMICOS DEL PAIS)  COMO CREAR UNA REPUBLICA INDEPENDIENTE ECONOMICAMENTE:      1 TRNSITO DEL PESO COLOMBIANO:    decir dejar de utilizar el peso, esto obligaría a que este se devaluara en el mercado,  generando un efecto domino en el aumento de la deuda publica internacional en dólares para bogota y Medellín. jurídicamente no tendríamos por que pagar una deuda que hicimos los ciudadanos,  el aumento en el costo de vida para los que hacen parte de bancada del gobierno seria enorme. también si tenemos en cuenta los problemas de desabastecimiento para ese Colombia (bogota ,Medellín), eso debido a déficit para autoabastecerse(aumento de la demanda) generaría un adicional aumento de precios, sumémosle el costo del combustible al tener que importarlo. esto obligaría esos gobernantes a perder capital y aumentar su deuda publica internacional y  a disminuir su calificación como país en mal condición económica y alto riesgo, esto aria que los inversiones internacionales disminuyan, al igual que las entidades internacionales dispuestas a correr el riesgo de emprestar capital. nuestra nueva moneda debería de preservar estabilidad económico como estado independiente y ya que contamos con tierras y alimento como población del nuevo país debería de ser factible generar una balanza comercia positiva. aumentando nuestro valor de la moneda si somos cuidados, con los ingresos por exportaciones. 2 PODREMOS CREAR NUESTRA PROPIA REFORMA TRIBUTARIA: una en la cual se quiten por completo los impuestos a las pequeñas y medianas empresas, esto generaría: el aumento de las empresas nacionales e internacionales y por ende una mayor cantidad y calidad de empleo en sus habitantes. se reduciria el hoy llamado impuesto a la canasta familiar al 10%  esto aumentaría la capacidad de comprar del trabajador permitiéndonos tener una mayor capacidad adquisitiva .  aumentaríamos los impuestos a las importaciones al 10%  de algunos productos no necesarios para la población de la nueva republica.  3 PODRIANOS DEJAR EL SALARIO DE NUESTROS  GOBERNANTES: POR EJEMPLO , QUE EL SALARIO DE ESTOS NO SUPEREN LOS 2 SALARIOS MINIMOS. 4. PODRIANOS IMPLANTAR LA PENA DE MUERTE PARA LOS CORRUPTOS, ASESINOS, VIOLADORES. 5.MODIFICACION Y CREACION DE UN SERVICIO MILITAR OBLIGATORIO: ESTE SERVICIO APLICARIA PARA HOMBRES Y MUJERES, SERIA EL EQUIVALENTE HACER TRABAJO SIN REMUNERACION PARA LA CONTRUCCION DE PUENTES CARRETERAS, CALLES, VIAS, LIMPIEZA  DE PLAYAS, PARQUES,  ESE YIPO DE FUNCIONES BAJO LA SUPERVICION DE ALGUIEN CAPACITADO DE LA POLICIA.(ESTA CLASE DE NORMA, REDUCE EL GASTO PUBLICO Y MEJORA LAS FINANZAS INTERNAS, PERMITIENDONOS TENER DINERO PARA APOYAR LA EDUCACION PRIMARIA, SEGUNDARIA, TECNICA Y UNIVERSITARIA( ESTO ASU VES, AUMENTARIA LA TASA DE ALFABETIZACION, REDUCCION DE INDICE DE VIOLENCIA, AUMENTO DE LA SEGURIDAD INTERNA, AUMENTO DE LA CALIDAD DE VIDA ELIMINACION DE GUERRILLAS Y PARAMILITARES POR FALTA DE OPORTUNIDADES DEJANDO MEJOR MARGEN DE MANEJO ECONOMICO DEVIDO A QUE NECESITARIANOS MENOS POLICIAS Y INTEGRANTES DEL EJERSITO REDUCIENDO EL COSTO EN LA GUERRA"LOS UNICOS NO VENEFICIADOS SERIAN LOS RUSOS  YA QUE LA MAYORIA DE LAS ARMAS ILEGALES VIENEN DE ESE PAIS"(PERDONENME MIS AMIGOS RUSOS, Y NORTEAMERICANOS PERO PREFIERO LA PAZ Y ESTABILIDAD Y ORDEN ANTES QUE LA VIOLENCIA).))  6. PODRIANOS MODIFICAR LAS FUNCIONES DE NUESTRO EJERCITO Y POLICIA: ejemplo que estos se encarguen  de orientar a los jóvenes EN LAS LABORES COMUNITARIAS , tales como el servicio militar obligatorio.   7. PODRIANOS ELIMINAR LOS IMPUESTOS A LAS EXPORTACIONES.(AUMENTANDO LA DEMANDA DE NUESTROS PRODUCTOS Y CLARO LOS EMPLEOS) SI HACEMOS ESTO SEGURO LA NUEVA REPUBLICA SERIA UNA POTENCIA ECONOMICA.

Yaasss boys y'all did it. We all know Bruno can saaang... But yaasss Anderson Paak I been a fan forever now watching you and your band do local gigs to sold out arena's.

And now a collabo with Bruno Mars, Anderson Paak I love watching you grow and I always knew you had that star quality.. your voice is so soulful and unique. I'm so happy for you.... Baby making music 🎶🎵🎶 at its finest, but y'all voices are such different styles yet mesh so damnnnnn perfecto!!!!! U guys just took me somewhere with this jammie jam. Somewhere good, possibly up in heaven floating on a cloud with a radio by my ear with this playing and my eyes closed🌨️📻☁️🙏✨  #LoveThem #Soulful #MagicInTheMaking #DynamicDuo #PleaseLeaveTheDoorOpen Xoxo 💋😘
Actually.. That background that three persons dancing is like some sort of Indians big poojas..whatever it makes me me too laugh..laugh..laughter

Tell me if anyone can said “OPEN” better then Bruno🤣
this is spectacular performance! Thank you.
Anderson's "Mmmm" @00:47 sounds sexy
this song just made me realize how sad it is if one day bruno mars decide not to create songs or  do collabs anymore.
The tradition of Temptations, Jackson5 and Earth Wind and Fire.... We are lucky, ‘cause we have legends in 2021. I love them!😍
Como  teve tanta gente que não gostou dessa música?! Ela é incrivelmente sensacional!!!
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😱😱😱😱😱😱😱

Still getting goosebumps 🥶
WOnderfuly Proffesionally done look at the Social Distancing Done Here! Bravo! the details is Fantastic!
When he said "fiLLET", I felt that
How could you hate on this?
Yes🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️
Bruno really should be one of the judges in the voice and x-factor because his talent is the most outstanding amongst other judges.
They're group style just like the jackson 5 ,  very acoustic
Meu Deus Bruno.. ❤️
las partes donde canta anderson son mis favoritas sorry
youuuuu wuwuwwuuwuwuwu
This is what means lyrically and musically talented. Live performance at its best. I seriously hate that Bruno Mars is so underrated . Amazing just amazing

PERFECTO
Que coisa maravilhosa
This is the real talent✨✨✨

I got the haze (purple haze) And if you're hungry, girl I got filets (woo-hoo) Ooh, baby, don't keep me (waiting) There's so much love we could be making (shamone) I'm talking kissing Cuddling Rose petals in the bathtub, girl, lets jump in It's bubblin' I ain't playin' no games Every word that I say Is coming straight from the heart So if you're tryna lay in these arms I'ma leave the door open (I'ma leave the door open) I'ma leave the door open, girl, mmm (I'ma leave the door open, hopin') That you feel the way I feel And you want me like I want you tonight, baby Tell me that you're coming through (C'mon girl) La, la, la, la-la-la-la I need you, baby La, la, la, la-la-la-la I got to see you, baby La, la, la, la-la-la-la Girl, I'm tryna give you this Ah Hey, hey I'ma leave my door open, baby (I'ma leave the door open) I'ma leave I'ma leave my door open, girl (I'ma leave the door open, hopin') And I'm hopin' Hopin' that you feel the way I feel And you want me like I want you tonight, baby Tell me that you're coming through, woo Tell me (tell me that you're coming through) Woo, woo-woo, woo, woo-woo, woo, woo-woo Woo, woo-woo, woo, woo-woo, woo, woo-woo la, la, la, la-la (Tell me that you're coming through) Girl, I'm here just waiting for you (ayy) Come on over, I'll adore you (I gotta know) (La, la, la, la-la-la-la) I'm waiting, waiting, waiting for you (tell me that you're coming through) Girl, I'm here just waiting for you Come on over, I'll adore you (La, la, la, la-la-la-la)
Bruno is amazing in concert. I was lucky enough to see him twice, and now he’s bringing the 70s look back.
A match made in heaven.. Their Album is gonna be 🔥..... Can't wait until it comes out...
seems we are headed back to the 70's... who's coming?
If Bruno Mars had been born at another time, he probably would be more famous than today. But We'd never have the chance to watch him personally and say to our children that we listened to a great musician like our parents.
Not one curse word and no auto tune! 🔥
Aqui español :v
Inolvidable  Bruno    lo mejor de lo mejor
I’m in love🥰
This is music.....
Bruno😍
Their performance reminds me of the temptations..love it!
Love it ❤️
Have mercy! Yassss! I love this version too! My new favorite! I already have the ringtone and be missing calls cause I'm too busy singing along!🤣🤗😍🎤🎵🎶💃💕
This is by far the best song currently in the top 40. This song is arranged very well, there is never a dull moment, chords, fills, vocals, everything is perfect.  This version even extended with a beautiful ending, makes you wonder why the single has a fadeout. I'm not so into soul/r&b but I can't deny the brilliance of this song
It's 0:29  ✌
Bruh this is better than studio version beat me
ชอบมากๆๆๆ
SMASHHHHHHH !!!!!!!!! 🥂
I like this version more than the studio one 😍
we love you ❤️❤️🥂🥂🥂
king of pop I fear
Bruno doesn't need auto tune, the auto tune that needs Bruno.
Bee gees vibes
Que voz ♡
Bruno voice = Next level 🥴🔥🔥🔥
Lip sync
🇧🇷 🥰🥰❤
Maravilhoso 🥰
wow
Gosto tanto dessa canção ❤
This is so classy and soulful. Love it! ❤️
Ok... am I the only one who keeps pressing repeat? This LIVE performance is fire!!! And that old school choreography.. I  love it!
Amazing!!!!
Just wow. Retro-tastic.
Algum outro brasileiro curtindo essa maravilha ..SLC amooooo o Mars..muito fera, e liiinnddooooo
Is it really live singing? 😲
the first ""leave the door open" :O
Minha mãe ama essa música
haters will say its without autotune
I just love this song!!!!!!!
Amazing
Bruno  is charismatic
So sweat si sweat
This songs feels like I'm in a time machine bringing back so much great memories back to my mind.
Awesome performance...
Yess...
Bruno Mars giving me straight throwback El Debarge vibes
I'm in love with this. Btw much better than a studio version
Deserves way more views and LIKES!
I love the whole vibe of this performance! The singing, them switching so smoothly whenever they take the lead. Amazing!!
4:09 the best part of the song "bubu-bubu"
Bruno looks like he got a little too excited
My door stays open all women are invited 😈 by the way this song is nice!!!
The backing vocalist with the afro hair cut should try to make his own career fo god's sake. He's so good. He'll be big!
Who is them ???
Imma leave my legs open forget the door
Essa música me traz a sensação de algo muito bom que não vivi, mas já sinto
To the 1% who read this, I just wanna say: Enjoy your next 24 hours :)
I hope this silk sonic thing never ends straight 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 take us back to real music boys this is fire
No lie when I listen to the track not a video I swear one person is singing
outfit and style are awesome🤩  dancing and moving are so smoothly  it let me feel I take the time machine
just amazing, i have no words
Looooooooove Bruno Mars and loooooove this song
아 진짜 존나 좋아
Perhaps the only best thing since covid
Bruno is just pure  P E R F E C T I O N !!!!
See how much better it sounds without that idiotic amount or reverb on the lead vocals?
The Best Vocal In The World !!!! Bruno Mars !!!! 2021 and still above
Bruno always shining like no other, such a talented artist

Bro, im not even kidding, laying in my bed, vibing to this, but didn't noticed my other hand was raised up while vibing halfway through, this song is too lit brooo.
God dayum!

Why does the video looks like 80,90s ?
C,Mon guys Anderson is amazing
Bruno Mars consider these artists as his equal. And that's Amazing. He even gave them the spotlight👏👏👏
When Anderson. Paak said "My house clean, my pool warm" that's when I knew I was going to like this song. The raspy shakes when he said sent shivers to my body. Nice and smooth. Whoah.  *Claps hands*
I'm here for anderson
bruno mars is an autotune in human form ♡
The most romantic song 💖😍
I really enjoyed this performance!!!
I hope this becomes someone's wedding song one day
Caraca  mano , ele lembra o talento do Michael Jackson incrível

Simplesmente magnífico, que letra, que música, que roupagem apaixonante, parabéns por este trabalho, Bruno Mars dispensa comentários, fora da curva esse cara, sou fã incondicional, Anderson Paak que timbre top, pegada super leve e envolvente, música boa demais para momentos inesquecíveis com quem se ama!!!
This is amazing
Love this tune blessed 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼😎😎😎😎💕💕💕💕
3:21 ☝
Bruno now is such a CLASSIC... With bell button pants. So 60's or 70's i think...
Bruno really reminds me of Michael Jackson with that Apfro hairstyle. Love it!
E disso que eu tô falando
Am I literally watching the commodores or Manhattan here? Wow!👍🏽
Both really slayyyyyy it! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Still not bored listening to this song 😘
When I first watched this version, I was really into the subtle changes they made to how the sing the song. With a song this excellent, those changes were just right. The thing I like most with this version though is how Bruno and Anderson end the song, especially that harmony at 3:45 to 3:56! That was just magic and their voices perfectly complemented each other. So excited to see what else they have in store for us with this project that I’m practically salivating for the music
Cancion bellisima te transporta al pasado, es genial poder cerrar los ojos y sentir tu cuerpo temblar de emocion
🥰🥰🥰🥰😍yesszz
Love this song
Estou ouvindo essa música há muitos dias não sei ao certo mais sei q é boa de mais e nao me canso de escuta-la🤗❤️
Oh no I'm in love :(
Não ouço muitas músicas mas esse cara é um dos únicos que trás o estilo maravilhoso da soull music, independente de tudo o cara revive muitos cantores e músicos que eram de mais..
That last verse got me speechless how do they do it their voices are amazing 😍
Te amo Bruno 😍❤️ come to Panama please 🇵🇦
Thy are amazing together
I would leave my door open for one Anderson. Real talk
Es un abuso 🔥🔥🔥 la rompe en todas tiene un flow james brown

Crazy music soo cool
BRUNO MARRY ME LMAOO 😫😫😫
Big wow!!! Amazing !!!
CANTA HERMOSO CSMR!! ES QUE- ES QUE- ES HERMOSO DIOS!! TE AMO!!     que se note que soy latina jsjs  Parte fav:  2:11 de ahi pa' adelante...  2:40 a pesar que solo dice "LALALALALALA" me enamoro mas (✿◡‿◡)  Discúlpenme, solo ignórenme  ;v
@brunomars amazing vocals 😍
แนวเพลง มันคลาสิค ใช้ได้เลย
No se ustedes, pero el presentador se parece a The weekend
all of them can sangggggggggg.
Anderson paak make me fallen in love, next bruno also do same way melted my heart.
I'm not sure if anyone else feels like I do about new songs *BUT I USUALLY DON'T* like new releases the first time I hear them. This song is one of the songs I liked by the time the *CHORUS* ended the first time around. Is anyone else like this??! 😁❤😊
csm les amoooooooo
It's has some drums from nxworries' livvin
QUE LINDO.
Amazing performance, amazing song ❤️
very beautiful lyrics, nostalgic melody, for me certainly a classic Motown
Issa WHOLE vibe😳
I love the way they work together flawlessly
simplemente espectacular!!!
I really thought that Bruno Mars was out of the picture for good. Seeing him perform again with another hit song is just overall satisfying.
Wall Street Journal: US birthrate lowest since 1979 Silk Sonic: Hold My Wine
I absolutely love this song
Maso ja
Dónde andabas perdido
is this a sample?
Uf ! Si Michael Jackson estuviese vivo hubiese cantado una canción como esta ! Gracias a la vida que estas tu Bruno que llegaste a ocupar ese lugar ! #Magia !
Talento?' sobrados!
Lalalalaalaaalalalalaalalalaalalalallalaallalaallala
sending love from LA 💕💕💕ps. thanks for always motivating me to keep making content!
Another one ..
smooth................
Such awesome talent ❤️😊👌👌
so good omg
Bruno is gorgeous and all but Anderson can actually get it, the man is FINE
That's the kind of sound and talent that came from the African American community, multi talented musicians  James Brown,Prince,Babyface,  and so on. Since the Rap, HipHop era it's more about image than talent.
I Love this song! And I Love them singing together! It's 🔥🔥🔥
MASTERPIECE
andersom voice is really enjoyable, the vibe uh 🥰
Of course i wanna lay in bruno mars arms 😍

❤️❤️❤️Old School Temptations...Manhattan... Style, grace, smooth and silky ❤️❤️❤️❤️
どこかSwingOutSisters感あって懐かしくて素敵

Love this song! Love Bruno Mars style of singing. He has a bit of old school mixed with the modern that make both old and young gravitate to his music. Anderson and his voice complement each other perfectly!🇹🇹

3.3k dislikes? I wish YouTube would remove this button, it’s completely unnecessary
WORK THAT BODY Drive my car wear my jewels Make me feel like the king of fools. Work that body Work that body Try not to hurt nobody.  David loved Bathsheba, Samson loved Delilah I love you and your name’s Twyla. Work that body Work that body Try not to hurt nobody.  Life without love is empty and cruel Without God’s grace we remain a fool. Work that body Work that body Try not to hurt nobody.  After death I pray to go to Heaven For I’ve been saved since I was eleven. Work that body Work that body Try not to hurt nobody.  Life can be short; life can be long God sees all we do right or wrong. Work that body Work that body  Try not to hurt nobody.  THANK YOU FOR WHO YOU ARE IN YOUR HEART ? Google + Tom Zart  Google = Most Published Poet Google George Bush Tom Zart

Thank yall for some real music. Keep it coming. We need it. I'm already impatiently awaiting a Silk Sonic tour.
can we just pause and acknowledge how Bruno is so confident in himself and has his ego in check enough to take like Anderson .Paak have the spotlight.
LINDA CANÇÃO, LINDA APRESENTAÇÃO.. AMAMOS BRUNO MARS IN BRAZILL
Is it just me or does Anderson look like Dave Chappelle?
Yesssssssss bruno ⚘⚘⚘
Bruno was just like his father MJ 😍😍
The amount of talent in one video
This song is perfect with anderson .paak voice
I am always amazed at how a song and performance as sumptuous and delectable as this, has 3k dislikes. Did you not know the song before listening?

bruno mars is the hottest man ive ever known.
I know them outfit be comfy af.
Sexiness overload..
Stress reliever haaayyyss olways on mah mind love love PETER 😩😍💋💋💋
Now this is what i call GOOD TASTE
Well, most can agree Bruno the man with the whole package but if we dared to sleep on Anderson like many of us did, well we some woke people now! I never knew who Anderson was until this. How did we miss that one? The two together; spontaneous combustion!!
Amo Bruno Mars🤩
hope its not lipsync on part of bruno
Omg they took it way back and I love that🥺
👏👏👏👏❤️❤️❤️✌️
Better than autotune
I am replaying Anderson paaks over again
Yass
I’m still trying to figure out why 3.3k people don’t like this!!!! This is some good laid back music 🕺🏽🕺🏽💃🏽💃🏽
Crooning is back!!!
He and other artists are the reason why I didn't give up on on music today and it's a long time after Bruno made another album and still he's still  fire speaking of fire am I the only one who's  heart melted
This is freaking nice and bruno and Anderson is really freaking talented and this song changed my life i love this song
Very good song, guys!
Everything Anderson .Paak does is gold. Damn
This song need Andre 3000 on it fire 🔥
This is epic! I am mesmerized by the vocals, the arrangement, the moves and the wardrobe!
The perfect duo to cover "The girl is mine" by MJ ... and Paul McCartney
Soon Miss universe 2020 evening gown background music
Far out. Couldn’t perform perfection any better. Kudos to amazing skill and talent.
This sounds BETTER than the actual song. Wow. Just wow. Timeless Masterpiece.
I am addicted and watching this on replay over and over. Lost count how many times at this point.
This is a fortnite emote so it would be nice to hear it here
So good
Perfect.
I thought Bruno was lip syncing, i was wrong
I am so in love with this song and of course the singers too
Wow!!!! what a performance
Bruno rules!
💋💋💋💋💋💋😙😙😙
Obvious lipsync.
Bruno Mars is like Michele Jackson . Everybody love their performance & musics .
Literall jaw dropping rendition. With this arrangement, I wish they can have Mariah Carey hop on a remix! Her We Belong Together 2021 Valentine Mix suits this arrangement, can imagine their voices melting like sweet butter - goosebumps!
it’s so effortless for bruno to sing AND dance
Why bruno ddnt take a chair one of the  the voice and be a coach?      Im sure it was exciteting watching him pressing that button .😅
a real showman
Love this song💞
3 years ago in summer I was in the US and accidentally got a chance to watch his show. Even tho I was too far from the stage I still could feel the energy of this amazing performer 😍 one of the best days in my life! Love you Bruno 💛
This is just. WoW.
Next time can he actually sing it not lip sync
Emocionante!🎼🎶🔊💕
Bruno is the best performer  Prove me otherwise
My my... i love bruno, his voice is EVERYTHING 😍

That was too smooth y’all
Anderson paaks voice is so underrated
0:30 always gets me.
Dave Chappelle killing it with those vocals.
their wave is killin me
It's good to see that the Motown is back!😘
I almost can’t believe this is live. Bruno is so astronomically talented, hit every note absolutely perfectly
They giving us that Gamble n Huff ish!! Chi lites, Intruders , Delfonics and come thru with the smooth moves to match!! Yall ain't ready for this!! No cursing, everybody suited down..,just classy classic!!!

I'm obsessed with this performance...it's so perfect, why can't there be more musician like this? Sigh
Those suits tho, they are taking back to the old school.  Love it.
I really enjoy this song. And I know my dad would too, as it reminds me of exactly somewhat the style of music he use to listen to...
My man, Bruno Mars!
😍✨💘✨
I WANT TO MARRY TO BRUNO MARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

the grammy content im looking for, anyone agree?
KING 👑
*Telling my grandkids this was the real 70’s*
Tô hipnotizada!
Bruno mars da best
🔥
omg i can't believe this song is really powerful thats mean Bruno Mars is really the best singer
Bruno channeling Sammy Davis Jr. with the thin mustache and glasses
sexual song that adorable in my ears..
I cant breath..omg. They are perfect
Muito bom 🔥
I like that Bruno is copying the 70's soul artist like the Chilites, Delfontics, Enchantments and many more. But what's sad is many don't even realize he's doing this. lol He is really paying homage to those groups back then who made songs just like this. In fact, I've heard this music before and can't put my finger on who made it. But I hope Bruno will bring back real music like this and allow this generation to appreciate the great soul singers in the 70's, who are all but forgotten.
REAL TALENT
This song is just so 🔥 like baby making music 😩😂
Ok let's be real...everyone became the background dancers/singers and just started two-stepping and snapping their fingers  "La la la la la la la" "I need you baby" "La la la la la la la" "I got to see you baby"  "La la la la la la la" "Girl, I'm tryna give you this" "Ah"
Bruno 😎😍🤩
OMGGGGG
Ooooooommmmgggggg Bruno Mars sings at the same key same tone as in the music video!!!!!
they actually made a better video than the already excellent original one. respect
This is what real music is
Viciada nessa músicaaaaaa 😍
Amo a música americana 💜
Can we just appreciate them on how they sing better without autotune
bruno will always and forever be one of the finest men ive ever seen
who would have thought the guy hot boxing a car with dumbfounded would be at the grammy's with bruno
Af q vibe boa❤
Bruno no necesita autotune  Autotune necesita a Bruno :3

Melhor música dos últimos tempos ....me arrisco a dizer que é uma das melhores do seculo. rsrsrs mas gostei um pouco mais quando eles cantaram tocando os instrumentos.
Anderson Paak is a friggin genius by the way just to clarify towards any doubters
I already knew bruno doesn't joke when it comes to music but damn Anderson... i wanna know WHO TF IS THIS GUY i want him in my playlists
So like the Jacksons its scary but modern with a oldschool flair
Bruno music has that 70's sound!! This song is so seventies soulful!! And Andrew makes it complete! He's a great singer as well!!

Wow
Bruno maravilhoso 😍❤️
This duo... and Bruno singing his lungs out man 🥵
I watched this an unhealthy amount of times lol
who else gets Jackson 5 vibes???
OMG RONY
Lovely
Bruno Mars never disappoints. He is always on time.☺
Luv this song  amazing 😻
Bruno Mars 😍
King <3
GOOD MUSIC IS BACKKKKKKKK❤❤❤❤👅👅👅
At the end Anderson sing just like K-CI. Anyone feel the same?
is this Jackson 5 era??
Real talk: I don’t know who choreographed the dance but these moves were from different timelines than the outfits and many styles that are mainly feminine . Good song , excellent singing, super background , amazing gear, but sadly the dancing did not match the song.
This was wholesome ✨
La voz de Bruno Mars es otra cosa.
Exelente interpretación 🤩🤩
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I’m a little late to this party but that was gorgeous ❤️
Gotdammmmn 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😭
La voz de Bruno me da 80 años de vida
Perfectionnn ✨✨✨
Real music again
This song literally make me Kilig in Filipino ❤❤❤ love this version of them 🔥🔥🔥
Bro the nostalgia
OMG!! BRUNO!! You did it again! ... naughty! <3
Demaisssssss😘😘😘😘🍀🍀
drop the full album
0% autotune  100% from the heart
bringing back this old school vibes in new school ways
0% autotune 100% from the heart
Isso é música de verdade <3
Impecável <3
I wanted them DA PUMP  to be like this
It's a pity that a song with an amazing melody, was filled with rap lyrics. The 70s song were more subtle about sex
The only guy to match Bruno Mars smooth vocals is Anderson Paak
This man might be short and have a strange style but idc its something in the way he moves and sings that makes him so damn sexy whatever he does
블루zㅣ하네잉
to those who disliked this video,  dude, you got a bad taste
Com certeza esse vídeo foi inspiração pra ela escrever essa música:  “Tcheca com tcheca balança essa perereca O meu nome é danny bond eu tenho uma precheca Se tu não acredita eu vou mostra para você Mas quando eu mostrar você vai te que lamber”
And here I was thinking nothing could beat the original version 😭😭😭😭😭
Impressionante o quanto canta esse Bruno Mars, que potência vocal, um dos maiores cantores da música pop, só música foda ele faz e parabéns para o Anderson tmb canta muito. Essa música lembra dos anos 70, 80 quem n viveu essa época, tá viajando no tempo.
I just just just love this song...
never felt this vibe since the manhattans and the stylistist
the bootleg Weeknd host
Evreybody is talking only about Bruno Mars, but I'm amazed by Anderson's verse and his voice tone
They gave a different definition of a stage performance, shit!
Real legends don't use autotone💖💯
the beggingg the flow yes bruno
I will tell my kids that these were the Jackson 4 hahaha
Can we she him and doja cat because I think that combo would be fire 🔥
i always wonder how anderson .paak will keep up with bruno mars' dancing in their future music videos. that's something i would look forward to.  i like this live version better than the recorded version because you get to hear anderson .paak's raspy voice with a bit of naughtiness. damn those adlibs from these two. :)
Keren sih ini
they got the weeknd as the host, wow!
Lol I swear this would've been a Motown hit if it weren't 2021 lol
😍😍Godddd💖💖Amazing presentation💃
RAINBOW 🌈🌧️🙏🌈🌧️🌈🌧️🌈🥺
Perfoms Anderson Paak & Bruno Mars
YESSIIIR
Orang indo kumpul
hermoso, fabuloso, fantástico es el verdadero arteee, simplemente belloooo
had me in tears... like actually, it's like he has Michael Jackson's talent, I hope Bruno does an homage to him one day.
♥️
That first verse transition...CLASSIC!
That grammy awards was political theatre at its worst, but this performance brings back the older sort of music by black artists and it's very welcome.  It was the only positive about that atrocious show.
Bruno mars is so majestic
🤍🤍🤍
Esto es verdadera música, con sentimiento 😔, no como el regueton y esas cosas 😔         Edit : Saludos y buenos dias 🤗
I won't be mad if they became a group.
When you got it all under control
please do a collab with Anne Marie and Charlie Puth🤎🤎
Yasssssss hunty,  y'all so dam smooth with this song 🎵!!!
Still can’t believe we got THIS AND HARRY STYLES

Okay someone has to say it. Despite the soulful nature of this song, it is by far one of the best performance of our time.
I even prefer this performance to the  original song video.
For me and my opinion the performance of this year's Grammys.
I love you, Bruno Mars!!! ♥♥♥
equal 70´s black music

Incrível
Bruno has the voice of an angel no homo
THIS IS SOOO PERFECT OMG
Wooooowwwwww!!!!!! The Best!!!!!😊
For my wish for the rest of my life .. Bruno and BTS can collaborate .. I don't know ... if this wish was granted.  Because of Bruno's song, I know the song and because of BTS, I can live happily through their song.  bruno and bts you are special and best  it's an honor to be able to convey through this. 😘🎉
His dance how he move made me feel swing
The voice of Anderson is just woooow ♥️♥️♥️
The way .Paak said “my house clean, my pool warm” (0:42), so smooooth 🔥🔥
Anyone remember Lighters song featuring Bruno Mars and Eminem? 🥺
Pimp Shit, Gangster, Clich right here
It’s nearly too much.
Daaammmnn that voice of bruno😍😍😍😍
Feels like between in the 70's or 80's vibe
1:08 on repeat
out of this world!!!!1
QUE MANEIRO! ESSE CLIPE É O VERDADEIRO SINÓNIMO DE RETRO!
Invincibles
Haze and fillayss.. 💓💓
The song really makes me bites my lip many time. Sexiness overload ☺️
👏🏾👏🏾♥️
His voice is magic awsome song man
Майкл Джексон слегка прифанкованный) Обалденно!!!
Smooth like shake
bruno mars eyy 🔥
Absolute fucking magic
The best performers
Played this song for 5 times straight. Just had to unrepeat this to make my heart calm. Whoaaah. Can't deny this is the most classic duet I have ever heard of. Dope! 😉😍😊
SILKY SMOOTH
I feel like this song is making love with me. HAHAHHAHAHAA
VINTAGE!!
brunos voice control is so good theres like no difference in the live performance
Melekat lagu ni kt kepala otak ak 😂😂
Bendiciones 🙏❤️🇨🇺🎶💯
Bruno is the classic king 👑
They just take my heart away....❤️
“I look to good to be alone” Fax
That was sooooo smooth! Bruno did it again! Wow!
The way they are performing make me think about " JackSon 5 " . Respect !!
3k dislikes ? You guys pathetic.
😳🥺😭😍🤩👏👏👏👏🔥🔥🔥 this is just too good to be true ❤️
Bruno's vocals are just goosebumps...  What a falsetto......💘💘
Auto tun: y por qué carajos no me invitaron a esta fiesta. Bruno Mars: y quien carajos dijo que te necesitábamos aquí. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🙃🙃
개쩐다진짜…
The best live performance this year! ♡
Wow Bruno your voice made my days..... #Wow beautiful!!!
良い🥰
That swap was so smooth😍
Bruno ❤️
I love the vibe, it's so 90s(♡‿♡)
Seriously I cannot with this man’s ability to sing like that
back to 90s
He really holds the microphone and sings into it like thriller MIchael Jackson
Aside from the more emotive lines on the verse by Anderson and chorus by Bruno this live version has a PROPER ending! Why oh why does everyone feel the need to fade out on studio recordings? Give me this any day of the week. Pretty much exclusively listen to this version now. Their take is on another level in this.
Trevor Noah is representing fr fr 👏🏽 👏🏽 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 🇿🇦 🇿🇦 🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦
LALALAAAAAAAAAAA I NEED YOU BABY
I like the way Bruno paid tribute to Michael Jackson and Mavis Staples at 3:42- Mavis Staples with the Staple Singers "I'll Take You There- Michael Jackson "Bad" cha'mone - shamone instead of C'mon which means come on- Love it!
Marvelous!!!!!!!!!!!! I luv you more already!!!!!!
AWESOME
This was the smoothest preference!! NOBODY CAN TOP THIS!! this generation will never understand real music and real talent that will speak to your soul! 💯🙌🏾🔥
Legends 🤩
is it just me who thinks bruno mars voice here sounds recorded?  or is it just damn good
My 2 babies💖Anderson and Bruno-they're both so talented💞
The new Stylistics🤘🤘🤘
That singer is awesome too
Thankx
Bruno bring s back back oldies...thats why its amazing
what a beautiful voice you have bruno mars
Everytime bruno mars sings its like having sex while doing a slow dance.... Wifey and I be planning makin baby no.3!!!!!!!
I will tell my kids that this is The Manhattans Jr.
Low key Anderson looks like a Soul Dave Chapelle. 😁
Maravilhoso Bruno, kisses from Brazil ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Sorry if I miss this, but is Philips Lawrence there producing this track, or is he having a separate path?
https://youtu.be/_iHFtIgKCls
I love them.

Yay🥳
Now that you know about Anderson Paak you should also know that he sounds even better performing live ❤
Maravilhoso!!!
Dear Bruno Mars, Please watch the cover video of Bruno Mars' song, which was covered by Korean K-pop singer Kim Jae Hwan. Kim Jaehwan is a fan who really respects you and the best vocal singer in Korea. He sings shockingly well. It's crazy. You'll know when you hear it.
So smooth!
What u doin
Bring BACK THE OLD TIME  style of singing, and fill our hearts
This is Pure SoulTrain baby!!!! Get in the ride and let us show you what is this all about.....
I just love 💕 this tune 😀
The Jackson's Four!😁
I'm your fan
3:20 ohh damn⬆️
Live Masterpiece 👍
Anderson fuck the end of the performance with his bu bu bu bu , he wont to impose over bruno  but was stupid decision, in a part of the song was good but not for the final.
I Love You Idol, Big Fan of My Kababayan, Bruno Mars.;-)
Bruno mars and The weeknd so far with this older vibe songs...thank you!!! i hope more artists keep this going
Bruno is a gem 💎 😭🤞
😍😍😍😍😍
What’s his number???? I mean if he’s leaving the door open, I’m trying to tell him I’m coming through!!!

New generation + old school = a hit!
Ah yes, Bruno Mars, who sounds awesome at recording and amazing at live performances
Wow so f***king amazing they're voice is incredible 💚💚
Wow !!!!!!! Them boys is bad. Real music is so amazing, especially when it's done with a touch of nostalgia.
This song reminds me of The  Stylistics MV,  You make me feel brand new.  70s
idol fevorite <3
This is the best of the best......I am SO IN LOVE with THIS SONG...... Whenever I hear it...I feel like I am in perfect , sonic, suspended animation.....and this is live , wow... when this song ends, I am like , no way............

NEWS FLASH THE 70's ARE OVER
I love the little dance they do when they put that one hand up
👏✨
Caraaa, que estética show !! ...saudades dos 70's, lembrei do tempo que usei essa gola exagerada  kkkkkk
I do wonder if he is as romantic as his love songs..
I don't know why but there's something about Bruno Mars and his musics that melts my heart. The genre of his music, his voice, and the lyrics. I am so obsessed with him.
sorry but this is a TEMAIKEEN PAPAA
In love with this song Anderson Paak is so underrated
Bruno kills it every time. ....
Bruno eres el mejor ❤
Love me some contemporary funk!
Stay  Calm and  Bruno Mars
Awesome!!
Is this even Live? this sounds WAAAAAYYY TOO GOOD TO BE LIVE.😯🤩
it's amazing how the weeknd presenting bruno mars...
Omg, I literally play this song all day
this performance so gay
Jackson 5 vibes
Eu sou tão hipnotizada pelo Bruno Mars, fico babando
perfection!
This video really has over 3000 dislikes so that's three thousand people who don't know good music
Perfecto
I see Soul Train!!♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
W O W
Artists like these are just one of the few reasons why I haven't given up completely on the music of today
Brunooo, te amoo
so bruno pra resgatar um pouco do passado com suas ideias
His voice/vocals are always on point 😭
Amo o conceito de ver todo mundo dançando e dando uma sarrada na tela KKKKKKKKK
Can we take a moment to appreciate the multifaceted Anderson Paak too?
https://youtu.be/PBcmIQxhUM8 Cover Bipolar Version
Straight from my art😁
❤️
Retro SWAG but sad song 🤪
I absolutely hate Trevor Noah, but this tune is too good!
Love Love this song.
I look too good to be alone... <3
🤩🤩🤩♥️👍
Buena interpretación, de los artistas es el mas completo. niceee!!!
Filipinos are very proud of that guy right there!
Even better than the original ❤😍
tunog vst.. idol nya sina vic sotto lol
Sensacional, não consigo parar de escutar .. show

I absolutely adore SILK SONIC💖💖
This is IMMACULATE!!
A ma Bru🔥🔥🔥
I keep repeating this song since the first release...this song is so good..sound so smooth 😘💜
I like that the two guys already had their name instead of being under Bruno Mars, I'm happy for them 🥰
If bruno had MJ moves......
In love with this ❤
Me da piel de gallina como canta bruno  Mars impresionante este man la verdad ❤️
el mejor de la puto fuckin music
4100 people must have COVDI-19, bc they have no taste!
Boy, let me tell you..Bruno loves singing and performing..shows in every performance
Omggg i miss this vibe
amazing❤️
Amazeballs! 😃
Awesome... ❤
This guy turns me bisexual 😭😭
🇧🇷
Trevor looks tobias or is just me
The smoothest transitions, choreography, vocals, harmony. Like the full package with everything. Wow 🤩 just 😳
It so so good to play again and again 🎶🎧
Amazing
Bruno Mars el mejor artista ♥️
No artist suits 90's style music  like Bruno Mars do..
good
Wow this is so beautiful 🔥👍
LO AMO AL BRUNO ♥
Who TF says it is Auto-tune?
Definitely a Delfonics vibe! Bruno Mars went after James Brown, Prince, and now the male 70s groups. 🤔
00:54 That was smooth af
Best Duo in the world(honoroble mention: the other guy)
So FAB!!👏👏
Lo adorooo🥰
Ain't breathing till I see The Weeknd and Bruno Mars' in a song
Great song.  Catchy Lyrics.  Great Performance...    How can you not like this..?
https://youtu.be/vReESxodDLs
Background singer/dancer in the back is getting down and so smooth with his moves. So glad to see Anderson.Paak finally getting the attention he deserves. He's been in the game a while but getting the recognition he deserves. I like Bruno and is a fan but its about them as a group not just him. I've watched this about 20 times and enjoy it each time I watch it.
Bruno Mars, o maior que temos
Estou apaixonado  por vcs Cristiane  do Rio de Janeiro  sape
This song has to be a hit. "I love this song." Bless their hearts somebody wrote a beautiful ballad for grown folks."  "I love It." (Smile)
Nice live performance guys🥺👏
Perfec  Bruno Mars he is magicccc!!!
Kevin Hart Would Be Proud
😍😍😍🥰😘
Incredibly good on all levels.

Sexual Chocolate!!
밀양 박씨 ♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡

Every time I listen to Brunito it makes me want to record with him after starting my career. It's part of my goals ...
Omg I love this song Bruno sings like he black 70”s artist
Lo amo💓
I just see a family guy skit with women throwing their panties and  then a pretentious man is in the crowd and realizes his drawers are gone too. 🤣🤣🤣
Brownz represent💯💪💪
OH my good how many time i fainted!!!! because I LOVE ITTTT!!!!!
Bruno Mars stands undefeated with his vocals!!!!
i like how their sun glasses sparkle
at 3:21 bruno to it to 1000!!
Watch this high it was incredible
The song is so good. They all look so fine in those suits. A feast for my senses. 🔥♥️
Bruno Mars is the closest to Michael Jackson's artistry. Talent, quality music, dancing ability and live performances.
Cant get enough of this song.... such a small guy and such a powerful voice... just adore Bruno Mars!
Only bruno sings better than the studio version. Like wow...so clean. Amazing!!!!

The manhattans
he is so small
Give love to Anderson. Paak as well. He was 🔥🔥🔥
Smoooth as Siiilk Sonic 🎼🎶🔩🥁🎸🎹🎤🎤
I love you
Bruno mars ate recording tape in his childhood. Rip my ears 😭 so blessed by his beautiful voice. And mind you this a live not a studio. Or am i being fooled 😭 sooo damn good.
Sad a full audience with masks, really sad. Espacially for something that even has no scientific proof. Anyway nice performance.
That moment when Bruno Mars is ur backup singer, he shines more than the main singer 😂
Cómo es posible los dislikes
Rate my music 1-10 🔥🌹
Love that joint.....please keep on doin good positiv music
Essa dupla ficou espetacular 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Let's talk about the beautiful voice that bruno mars has  ...
Purooooo talentooooooo♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️😍😍😍😍😍
Goood
O melhor
Amazing!!!😉👍🇵🇪 Saludos Lima - Perú 🇵🇪👍😉🐊💙😉👍🇵🇪
Creo que conforme más veo y escucho bruno Mars performances, me doy cuenta que este artista es un de los que se deben valorar y apreciar más hoy en día..digo hay tantos hits, justin Bieber, Harry styles, raperos etc. Que como dicen los comentarios hacen dinero de sus polémicas, de sus videos extravagantes o están mame y mame en sus redes, y este hombre humilde apenas y se asoma a sus redes tiene música de calidad. Ojalá siga así por mucho
treasure vibes
bruno mars' voice is soooo gooodd and soothing and that man is alsooo gooodddd like his adlibs
Michael should be so proud :)
They could have left those collars in 70s tho...
Beautiful song and their voice❤❤❤
This is absolutely the main part in a music history book in the future.
This is a lot of hard work behind this easy performed looking Song!!! Well done !!!
BRUNO MARS IS AMAZING!!! I LOVE THE SONG AND IM GLAD HES BACK
Bruno Mars!!!! 💛💛👏🏾👏🏾🎶🎶🎙️🌎

Adoro Bruno Mars. Ele é show. Essa música ficou fantástica, ouço várias vezes.
Can we take time out to show respect to the niggas from the 70’s that made this kinda flow so cool and sexy..
Oh my Goodness! They look so amazing! I love Bruno, he's so sexy 😋

Filho do Mj
A couple of days ago, it sounded like "my poo warm" instead of "my pool warm" and unfortunately that's how it's been sounding since
🙏🙏🙏🔥🔥🔥
He can pull off dressing like the 70s did. Still look dang good

Uno de los mejor cantantes...me encanta y amo este estilo de música... BRUNO MARS A LOVER ...
Wow I stunned when Trevor Noah introduce Anderson "Pac(or Park)" instead of "PaK" because his proper last name gotta be pronounced "Park" or "Pac" like 2Pac Shakur.
This song is amazing , we love you bruno

Imagine Michael Jackson and Bruno Mars made a song
Cada vez que escucho esta canción veo el gran aporte que los afroamericanos hicieron a las artes y esta canción es espectacular, Bruno es un genio, brilla con luz propia. Gracias por regalarnos Bruno y ANDERSON esta bella pieza al mundo.
Wow!!! 😳😳
Wow! Awesome song especially when you see them two performers putting their back into it-🤔
Amazing
This sends me to Migos Walk it talk it
Bruno definitivamente es un alma vieja jajaja me encanta toda esta onda de los 60 lo bueno siempre vuelve
I need to make my mom listen to this.
Bruno Mars is the best always
This is that stuff
PELO AMORRRR..... essa música é um orgasmo musical!!! Completamente apaixonada ❤
Bruno Mars owns every era <3
😍
Get ready for the new batch of pandemic babies

Bruno mars proud filipino❤🇵🇭
Good Luck
Hell absolutly talented these two, out of words, perfection
The Temptations - Treat Her Like A Lady  Dopo 40 anni SIETE Uguali
Earth :After a pandemic you need a Bruno Mars song..

This is a very good song to play and listen to with a chic beside you, drinkin' some fine wine with a dim light and having some good convo...damn!! You already know what's next...haha!
Biracial Asian represent..   Bruno 🇵🇭 Paak 🇰🇷
Anderson .paak looks like Dave Chappelle
Mr. Anderson, you're the best. I'm a big fan of yours.
bruno mars is so hot omg

Goosebumps 😍
More music like this please 👏👏❤
Walang hiya ka Bruno Mars, bat yan nakatutok samen😭💀
0:56 perfect synchronization
😘😊🌹
The vibes are amazing
Oleee genius !!!!!
I am so happy to hear the new song. I am especially happy to see how well it is doing out amongst everyone. "Ima leave the door open" puts me in mind of the old school music in the 60s and 70s. Commadores, Earth, Wind and Fire... Etc. Those boys back then knew how to get a crowd moving, just like these guys do. In these hectic and chaotic times, to turn on the radio and hear such a beautiful melody of music and the lyrics playful, light and sexually charged... You can't listen to that song and think of anything but who you are watching perform. Mr. Bruno Mars, you are now and forever will be brilliant. You outshine the brightest of all stars in my eyes, your partner, Mr. Paak, very gifted as well. Your "Silk Sonic" as a collaborative effort... Got your pockets going jing-a-ling, all women want you, and all men want to be you! Not to shabby.
La perfection !♥️
Why im getting Dream girls vibes like yeahhhhhhhh God this performance is perpectly perfect
참 행복해지는 노래네
Can Bruno Mars please star in a 70s film? Imagine that!
This performance is amazing. The combination with the background singers and synchronizing dancing. Who came up with the name " Silk Sonic" is a genius. I'm curious if Bruno give the other artists also a front stage performance to shine, like he did with Anderson. Paak. ...hyped for the future and the album drop.
How is this live OTL kings
Это круто! ✊
ohh yessss 3:21
Se eu olhar esse homi ao vivo eu DESMAIO MEU DEUS 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
What an amazing song. Hope they make more !
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Michael Jackson is God

I don't know WHAT it is but Bruno Mars sings SO perfectly it almost sounds like his part was pre-recorded! SO CRAZY! With Anderson Paak's voice, it is perfect but you can hear that it's live. I don't know if I'm the only one that hears this? I love this song so much and I CANNOT wait for the album to drop! <3
Ngl Anderson Pak stole the show best 🔥🔥

Ése tipo canta tan bien, es tan tranquilizante, su voz lo lleva a no se dónde pero es muy exquisita su voz. Cada vez que puedo escucharlo lo hago en compañía de una buena cerveza.

Stylistics copy
Jesus Christ is the Son of God! All other men that have walked this earth do no add up to the perfection that Jesus Christ is. He is the ONLY mediator between God and man, not marry, not the pope, not the universe, only Jesus. Many of you may know this but yet you do not do anything about it! C'mon you must be born again as Jesus Christ taught before you end up in hell!. Repent and believe the gospel so your sins may be blotted out. Youtube: Noah Hines
If they fade out enough on Anderson, you'd think it was Dave Chappelle on backups 😬😳 I was half expecting tyrone biggums to get onstage and start scratching 🤷🏿‍♂️🤣
This song is my wedding song.
never seen an artist this perfect

low key looks like shaved lacazette
I keep expecting Andy Samberg to pop up. These lyrics are hilarious
Well done guys!!👏🏼👏🏼...will be another classic!!
I can't sleep
I thought this is a music video or something like recorded. Bruno Mars always sing like his original audio but with a style of singing it live. Its soo perfect. His name is like a genre already.
I heard this song on the Radio many times but this is my first time watching the video.. And Damn this Video is Hott!!
I thoroughly he was dead or am I tweaked
Fucking Anderson up there having fun live the energy
Essa música é envolvente demais. Amooo❤🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Eres magia, siempre en mis días tristes me alegras con toda tu música. I LOVE Bruno

I’m in my mid-70s and l love it! Very refreshing tune in this dark times of the virus! Bruno Mars never fails!
Amo a Anderson!!!! 😍

Timeless, works in any decade
Amei demais essa música
I LOOOOOOVVVVVEEEEEE THIS SONG
I hate this commentsection. Where's the love for Anderson. Paak? Like Bruno did this on his own? Riiight. This is the first song i've ever liked with Bruno in it - And it's without a doubt only because of the styling / composition from Anderson.
Number one
A new legend in the making
これは80年台なんでございますか？
Welcom to Mexico of New Monterrey city ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

I 💘 this song (even though  Bruno look like a 1970s porn star)😜..It reminds me of Harold Melvin & the Bluenotes, LTD & The Commanders revamped. IDK but everytime I hear this..I think of Janet Jackson's video.."Anytime, Any Place".. This that " Grown & Sexy"..😜
Unreal
Bruno Mars never disappoints
as smooth as chocolate milk..
This was beautiful.  I like how they took it back to old school.

This is like a mash of 90’s ,2000’s  and 2010’s. The energy and vibe of the 90’s smooth music, 2000’s for the style that Bruno sins in, and perfect beats and timing from the 2010’s. Absolutely amazing

Wahouuuu cette chanson  est parfaite. Que ça fait du bien d'entendre une telle chanson.
Esto sí que es un show, no como los que se paran a cantar reggaeton, que además de playback, ni bailan, sólo se paran a mover la boca
Straight from 70s soul and 80s R&B. ❤️❤️❤️
Love this. Curious tho, where are the Hooligans

1:57 and that folks how babies made
💗💗💗
Bruno mars=Homem perfeito
apenas se acordó que tiene más fans, aún así te amamos bruno pinche presentación perfecta
I think he just takes his music serious He only puts out the best And the best can take years if he wants perfection like MJ and Prince ...  Real Artist like him don't rush to put out stuff just for attention or money..  That's why we have so Many trash artist 🤦🏾‍♀  Bruno takes his time and puts it out when he feels its ready.
🙌🏻🙌🏻👏🏻👏🏻
This song will make a lot of babies.
surreal de bom puta que pariu da vontade só de ficar sentindo a música que delicinha jesus
Essa música é espetacular, que melodia é essa? Bruno Mars, Anderson Paak, top demais

This is amazing <3
Me: im gonna close the door Everyone: ima leave the door open
Muito perfeito cara! ❤️❤️❤️
This sounds like a typical new edition  song which Ralph Trensvant Ricky Bell Johnny Gill and Bobby Brown would have shredded masterfully
Bruno nunca erra, incrível.
How you dislike this song. These ppl need help!!! This is masterful on so many levels we need more of this and not of this other crap. I'ma be vibin to this for awhile
Bruno is just "Next Level" nuf said
Un amor🥰
Their vocals are insane
So James brown and Aretha had two children called Bruno and Anderson and no one told us?
Reminds me of the songs of the 70-90's
bruno and anderson switched spots so smoothly
this is such a vibe
Great!
i can't get enough of this song
Bruno and his voice just perfect😭😭😍😍❤️❤️
Reminds me of the temptations the form the style the vibe and the song sheesh 2021 silk sonic/ the new temptations
Version Boyz II Men of wish
Una e, dar alta e să simți,, cu toată celebritatea 🤘
those 2,5K thumb down are just jealous of Bruno´s moves
Bring this music back !!!!
finally able to watch this in Germany (on his chanel)
I wish my life was as smooth as that first transition between Bruno and Anderson.... Damnnnnnnnnnn
No me puede gustar más😍
I love how performed like the 90's, and Im living for it
it's so hard to believe the days when he wore converse, jeans, a button-up, and a fedora with a full ducktail style of hair under the hat. wow, it's been a great 10 years of evolution.
Silk Sonic couldn't have a better name, just smooth..
They weren't even nominated as a group and they still stole the Grammys!!!!
Linda música ❤👏👏👏👏
Great porformance! Almost makes you forget about the CCP.
❤️❤️
Vibes! 🥰
My door is open please don’t make me wait
❤️❤️❤️❤️

OMG best song I've heard in years. Love the feel of the 70s. Keep making more
I´m literally allucinating with this, i hope to see you both soon here in Chile please <3
I could listen to that forever and ever!
This reminds me of Jackson 5😭❤️
Bruno looks so much like papa Mars when he was younger😍...cant wait for this concert to happen the 70s retro outfits are gonna be crazy...will he wear a jumpsuit🤔😏....love this version

The outfits, the dance moves, the glasses, the scenario, the song, the words, the vocals... EVERYTHING is on point! The only bad thing is that It comes to an end, if this performance was 3 hours long, i would be for sure watching and dancing in my living room

These guys can really sing.. Their outfits remind me of the 70s or something.
LOVE ! No rope or cable can hold so tight What love can do with twine. No kiss can taste so bittersweet As the one which captures our mind.  The first sign of love is the last of wisdom As eager hearts fulfill desire. Love is just a staple of life Though Heaven sparks the fire.  Heaven knows no rage like love Once to hatred it has turned. How wise are we who are such fools Who forget the lessons we've learned.  Love, indeed, descends from Heaven Like a shooting star across the sky. Love sometimes stirs the dust Till tears fall free from the eye.  THANK YOU FOR WHO YOU ARE IN YOUR HEART ! By Tom Zart Google = Most Published Poet On The Web Tom’s 1,650 Poems Are Free To Share!

The best song of this year 2021 . I love Bruno Mars, Anderson .Paak, Silk Sonic!

A heavenly performance. Worthy of your greatness <3
Oh my God i thought the second voice after "Dont say that" is "Sha sha sha" but its actually "Shut yo trap" im so sorry hahaha

Hey Bruno Mars are you going to make a album with Anderson Paak.
Super IDOL  <3<3😆😆😆

I love this song! Reminiscent of 70's music!
Thats was healthyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
i can't understand, why this feels like 80's song ?
Sing Bruno....Its just the way you are Perfect 🤩 mr Paak you are a beautiful reminder to this grand mom of yesterday’s groove.....this is styling’🤩
Welcome to 80-90's

Gosh, I'm grateful that I'm living in the same era as Bruno Mars. He's a living legend. His songs are immortal.
noone is going to talk about trevors hairdo?
The consistency of Bruno Mars' voice is just awesome! He sound exactly the same performing live as that of the studio version.
They are geniuses, know how to attract people and look wonderful.
I wont bite unless you lie 😉
he is still wearing his cross necklace since young, so, he is not sold out yet to illuminati
Now THIS.... is good music, yall!!!
GOOSE-BUMPETY SMOOTH!!
G💙
dont chu think how interesting bruno mars and silk sonic? singing abt romancing and loving but no sexy girls, naked girl, shaking butt or wtvr, just pure voice, no autotune and them enjoying their song!
Spectacular performance😌
SIP-SIP daw para sa mga SIP-SIP dyan HAHAHHAHAHA
Super great performance
When live ver is better than studio one... dang it
Who would dislike a good music like this? Seriously y'all guys have no taste maybe a plunger would help

Que lindo!😍
THE REUNION PRAYER ! Someday they shall dig my hole in the ground In an old-fashioned graveyard just outside of town. The trees there are ancient and so are the stones The people beneath them are just dust and bones.  The last time I went there with a fistful of flowers I took the time to reminisce for one or two hours. I looked at the carvings, on granddad’s gravestone "Here lies an outcast who died all alone."  A robber of trains, and a buster of banks He took all their money and never said thanks. Then there was grandma who taught Sunday school She said that Satan had made him a fool.  My mom and dad lie there side by side I remembered the fire the night they died. Then there was you, dear, who I love most of all. I sure wish your heaven had waited to call.

Glad Bruno Mars lets Anderson shine. This speaks highly of his character
Somebody said elsewhere, we need Don Cornelius back to intro them on Soul Train Saturday! RIP DC.
Many people are craving the return of this kind of music. Thank you Bruno Mars, Anderson .Paak, Silk Sonic.
😭why bruno's so beatiful😭
OMG this song is so fantastic what a group of performers.
So much spice in Anderson's voice
Lord Bruno I love you.  🌹
Pls Mr. Mars make a hour loop of these song. I want to hear and play it continually. 💕
Two great artists. They compliment each other very well. It never feels like they’re trying to „out do“ one another, just giving exactly as much as the song needs. Never more, never less. Pure perfection. 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Smooooooooth!
Simplesmente demais , maravilhoso…..wonderful 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🤩🤩🤩🤩 não canso de ver👏👏👏👏👏👏
Gracias por decirme tercermundista
Vietnamese with love❤

Im not gonna lie but this type of performance and song that is for everyone to hype about. ❤
80 anos depois tu libera isso no Brasil, vc acha bonito bruno?
Danggggggbbb tha' bruno moves 🥵🔥
I love that people LOVE the Black sound. I just wish that Blacks singing R&B could be as successful. It amazes me how a Justin Beiber or Timberlake can take the Black sound and prosper while true R&B singers who are Black have been shaded out of their own sound for years.
Bruno Mars never fails to come out with a big bang! This is REAL music and a genius collaboration..seriously can't wait for this album to come out!
vc sabe que é o maior
Por fin te acordaste de Latinoamérica.
This song is really amazing
QUEM É DO BRASIL E É FÃ DO BRUNO DÁ LIKE AQUI SÓ PRA EU VER UMA COISA
Bruno Mars!! Hermosa presentación, ¡¡ PERU ALSO ADORES YOU♡♡♡♡♡!!
WHY - ???? Why must we yearn for what we can't have When already, we have more than we deserve? Nevertheless, we’ll take all we can get Performing daily for those we serve.  Why must religions battle one another Calling on the faithful for deadly jihad? Why should so many die for the few When all are the children of God?  Why do soldiers sing as to death they march Which they have for centuries and more? Knowing quite well, combat awaits them Leaving nothing as it was before.  The biggest question of life is "why" The wrath of man is always in season? Why is our world the way it is Like a tragic poem without rhyme or reason?  It matters not, how long we live But more, how well we play our part. For the road to Love is always near As long as there's truth in our heart.  THANK YOU FOR WHO YOU ARE IN YOUR HEART !

Man bands are back... finally!
This was absolutely brilliant!!! I've never heard of Anderson Paak before this song and I liked Bruno Mars collaboration with Damian Marley but this song made me respect Bruno Mars as a musician. Well done Silk Sonic y'all are silky smooth.
Al fin t acuerdas de los tercermundistas
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Pretty telling that a 70s style song is getting so much attention and praise. This style is head and shoulders better than anything else in the charts. More 70s music please.
I love this performance so much, their voice is beautiful!!!!!!!💓💓💓💓💓
Alright, all ya'll gotta do is set this to 360p to complete the vibe and look.

3:50 !!
What a shame that Bruno Mars has to ruine the tune with his voice, it s such a contrast between the genuine voice of Anderson Paak that when Bruno Mars start the all tune goes down , i think thtat  Bruno should continue as Mr. Lacoste a.k.a Ricky Regal....The new fashion designer
Anderson made this better than the original DANG 🔥🔥
Anderson's voice!💕🤩🔥
That spin tho!

I love this song. Actually I love all your songs

Real old school sounding vocals and AWESOME HARMONY

This is crazy but I love it

Paak > Bruno in this track. Not even a contest!
Wow I wonder how many babies have been made from this song🤣🤣🤣❤🔥🔥🔥
Ladies an gentlemen the New temptations 🔥🔥
I love this song so much they nail it🔥🔥💯💯
God put these gentlemen on this planet at the same time for a reason.
And they said modern music is trash ... every generation’s got its timeless gems, sometimes you just gotta look hard for it, and sometimes you get something successful and special like this piece 🙌
How can anyone dislike this?
Yesss finally bring back the Love
Love It,,,🤩
dmv lightskins powers come from this song
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
i love this.
I like it than the studio version. And it’s live !!!
Bruno don’t know but he done brought back the essence of male in the music industry. As I go through the comments I can tell it will influence the way men view women. At least I hope. Because music is that powerful
I’ve been waiting for men to get back to this vibe and look. Makes so much sense. And I’m only 31. This really just showcases raw talent. No distraction from the artists. Awesome job gentlemen 👏👏👏👏👏👏
Now this my kind of music.  Just took me back
LOVE this song
Love my Man and without a hoodie
I love it
This is the type of music that will be played for a very long time ⌛⏲️🎶
Keep the songs coming!! My favorite artist of all time ❤️
Cooooooooool
Perfect harmony. Effortlessly and precise...just beautiful. Couldn't distinguish if it was live or not. Wow💖💖💖💖
🎉🎉🎊🎊🎊🤑🤑🤑
🔥🔥🔥Daaaaaang…they reached way back and brought the Soul Essence of the sophisticated sensual man.
This song makes my heart flutter and I am 69 yrs old- great music is hard to come by these days. Pacc and Bruno nailed it with this song absolutely beautiful voices ❤
This reminds me of my generation. They need to make more music like this.
Ohmygod
Hilarious and entertaining, or it’s just me?
The collaboration I didn't know I needed
I love this song I can't stop replaying it this video and their moves not to mention their outfits aka old school attire old school vibes going on I love how they vibe their voices blend well together
Omggggggg ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Did we just go back in time to like 1972? Oh yes we did!
0:26
Got damn that was good.
Who could dislike this?  only people that dislike this left the door open and she never showed up
BIGGEST CHILLS
He’ s better each song!
Love this! Moves something in me!
Unbelievable! Bring it all the way back.
Now this is what I call grown folk music. This style of music reminds me the group of my generation. The Dramatics, The Stylistic, The Temptations, Blue Magic, Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes featuring Teddy Pendergrass and The Tavares and the Whispers. Thank you for bringing good soul stirring music.
This has that old school vibe and I love 💕 it! Great calab!!
Everything about this song and video is genius.
i fkn love bruno
Dis Dat Joint!
This is my new jam
These are some talented men
I love this
The return of great R&B/Soul music
From that little kid in the Elvis costume on the Arsenio Hall show to this.(INCREDIBLE)Bruno,you're a baaad boy!!!🎶🎵
❤❤❤
Damn, this is magical
I have a message for music producers and recording labels. This is magic and if you had any sense you would consider that some men are romantic. Twerking, thugs, and slapping a ho doesn’t appeal to men who want to share their heart with a beautiful woman.  This song speaks to me.
A solid jam! The energy is palpable!
Beautiful song
Bruno is so fanciful, almost impossible to be true.
I can only hope to turn out like these smooth criminals
Yes!!
Wounderfull
Wow Perfecto
Love this song. The outfits are fantastic. They have that smooth classic sound.
I LIKE This Song, Bruno Mars Doing His Thing As Usual,And Anderson Paak  Sounds Good, Too..❤
Now I want orange tinted heart shape glasses and a kangaroo hat.
Love the old-school vibe of this song!
,
,
This is amazing. This 58 year  old lady cannot wait to purchase  this CD. We would say an album back in my day.  My 80 year old mother would love this music  while we drink wine and gardening
I love the vocals and everything and the suits and like the old school kinda vibes remind me of the treasure music video and I love it
Bruno Mars sound just like the song, on yt
I love this song 💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾
I need more of this.
I love this song I love the dance moves I just loved it
Brutal!!!!👏👏👏👏✌️🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷
Yea
Bruno mars is not playing he went in
They have so good vocal cords
I suck at singing
Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh
Sheesh
Love it love it
That boy Bruno is smooth back there🕺🏽
I just kept playing this song over and over until I can memorize every words! Bruno is the best! I never heard of Anderson but he is so good! Now I'm a fan!
I thought this was a Dave Chappell show in the first 30 seconds lol
The soul craves real music with positive energy. That’s why everyone loves this song and not the rest of the crap we hear everyday on the radio.
I'm obsessed
This is what is defined as flawless. Anderson took me straight to Mars!
One of the best performances I've seen in years! Hands down!!!
Bravo!!!!👏🙌
Thank you so much for a clean song with true singing. You will go far by keeping it clean. We still have true singers....
Man Bruno Mars is good and everything, but Anderson Paak really stole the show. We need a version with just Anderson.
SHOOO. Wanna dance boo?
Like the Merovingian in the Matrix said “it’s like wiping your butt with silk”
Wait this a live performace?
They need to be a band!
Play this every day!❤
The collaboration of the two is just 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I just keep playing this song over and over. Wow I this is number 1 on the chart.  Sounding like the stylistics.  ❤️❤️❤️❤️🎈
THIS IS AMAZING!!!!
Finally a real feel good song Thank you Lord!!!
Not only an awesome song  but Best performance and best dressed 😍
These young men are very talented and the beautiful music  is out standing 😊🎵🎵🎵🔥old school 😄🎵👍💯
I am 60 years young, and the musical style and voices have taken me waaaay back! I have listened to this song on repeat for entire hours at a time while gardening. Even the birds, bugs, and bees love it. The lyrics are funny, though. I’ve watched this video many times just to see the visual vibes! I need help for this song addiction.
Morning the baby I love my love 😍 I miss
OMG Love This song!! So Fresh, Original and Soulful 💞💞💞💞. 2021 Song of The Year I'm calling it!!!!
OMG!! Love this. Perfection!
Yessssuh!!!!  They jammin!!!

Awww Sh$$$iiidd Nah This Sooonnggg Is 🔥
👑 😍Amazing
This song is the shitazi.  I luv it.
Love it
They slam this one!BAM💣
My momma would be so proud and ready to jam xxxooo
Leave the door open...just a little bit!
I just need them to release the entire album so I can get it on vinyl and pretend to make babies
Love Bruno and Anderson but this is "reminiscent"  of Enchantment or Bloodstone. Those of a certain age will understand. But they sound great but everything old is "new" again!
They stupid. Lol
Reminiscence of the Temptations!
The world wasn’t ready for this performance.
My  new first dance song at my wedding
His hair is so different from 10 years ago and today I don’t feel like doing anything
Bruno is so yummy 😋
They did that🔥🔥🔥🔥
I’m a leave the door open
Instant Classic!!
Alot of babies were made off of this music!!!
OLD SKOOL!!!! I had to listen again
This is a beautiful song! They are really talented
I loved it
This whole song is just a straight vibe for me these days!
David Ruffin
WOW!!! That was AMAZING!!!! I LUUUVVV me some Bruno Mars. He is SOOOOOO gifted & talented!! N Anderson Paak is very talented 2! ( But I never heard of him like that 🤷)  I LUUUVVV Bruno's falsetto!!😍😍😘❤
Bruno Mars you are the star of everything
It's like the First Time Every time
I've said it before and Id say it again no disrespect to the late great michael jackson but bruno mars style and creativity and the people around him makes him the closest sing I think to michael jackson
Smooth describes it to the tee🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Do it again before I die from lack of soul.
Haven’t heard such beautiful music in so long, fell in love with this song. On repeat all day, Alexa should know it by heart lol
Damnnnnn! This was so good live!! Anderson and Bruno need to absolutely make more music! The soulfulness in this song is just mesmerizing 😍
Please someone please. Give them a grammy now like Asap . 😩😩❤️❤️😭😭 o gosh I love them ! I felt that I live in the 80s when I know I’m in the 20s but it’s just the best feeling I’ve ever felt listen to a song with the amazing singers! Beautiful performance .
I listen to this over and over..musical genious's
This is the version they should have recorded. I love them both
Wow I come to play this this version more then I do the original ! This song is amazing
My favorite song of the year
Didn't know there could be such a great collab that works so well together what took this soo long I am amazed at this genius work 🔥🔥🔥🔥

OK let’s go ahead and say it this is definitely the song of the year! How could it not be!
This better than the official video

This song is 🔥🔥🔥🔥. I love the old school vibe. Real music.
So in love with this song 🎵
Thank you Jesus. I have been patiently waiting for the real R&B return. And they sound really great.
💜💜💜💜💜💃🏻💞
Dope
I havent heard a new male vocal that good since boys 2 men and dru hill and most def kci and jojoba especially
I’m expecting them to get interviewed by Don Cornelius after this performance.
The performance was perfect they both made that song magic it's a  great collaboration!!!
Bruno gives it his all .
i like that part from 2 25 - 230
It’s wine sippin in a robe from NOW ON!
Wow Brunos voice just perfect also other singers were good but Bruno is the best
Straight 🔥
🏅💰⭐🎧🎤💞🎶🙂
Love ❤️it
Pure soul
Damn Bruno still fine as wine and sounds how he looks GOOD 🤣
This is straight 🔥
It satrted with Michael Jackson he died Bruno Mars came around
Love
🤣❤
I swear that's Dave Chappelle.
Wow just wow😨😍
So beautifully old school!
Supper bowl vibes ..
is it just me or does Anderson remind you of Dave Chappelle??? lol
1:57
This stinks of a Jackson 5 song but I just cant put my finger on it.
I love this video
I can honestly say that I heard this on the way to work a drive over two hours long and I listened to this song over and over again.  His reminds me of the 80’s when you had the quiet storm on the radio on Friday and Saturday night before going to the club.  Such good times and definitely great memories.  True musician and this song fits so damn good in that era.  Thank you Bruno and Anderson on a perfect song.
This is pure pinoy pride 🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
That’s my shit #2021
Thank you to Both Bruno and Anderson for there collaboration on an outstanding song.  This funk and soul is music to our hearts and souls.  This music gives us hope that in the near future things will get better.  This brings back so many good memories.
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Is it just me or as time passes Trevor sounds more and more like Mandela?
Bruno Mars can make grown men cry...     Typing as I wipe away tears
This Album WILL potentially give way to a New Generation of Babies being Born #FACTS
I agree! Now they need a remix ft justin timberlake! What ya think???
I'm lucky to work at an arena in Philly. I've seen him perform a few times. He puts on one of the best shows I've seen in my 10 years of working there. He always sounds great and so does his band. High energy concert.
Where to get those glitter heart sunnies ❤️
I Don't Know About "W.A.P" But This Song Got "GRAMY" All over  It.
OMG can Bruno stop singing so l can get some work done. He gone get me fired🤣🤣🤣( can anyone say repeat, repeat, repeat....) Lol
THIS IS THE VERSION THEY SHOULD PLAY... BECAUSE THEY IN THE POCKET...ON THE RADIO IT'S KINDA OFF...AND DICTION IS ON POINT. STAYS ON REPEAT 🔁.
Classic
I love the way Mars and .Paak vibe. That is so cool. Bruno Mars might actually be a little bit humble. Nice!  This sounds like a 70s hit, like the Spinners or the O'Jays.
Nice & Clean. Tk U
People gonna sue them in the future for child support. Gonna be a baby boom with this song.
I love this !
Please make more music like this
Bruno kind of remind me of Sammy ...
Their voices are UNIQUE separately, and together, they are EXTRAordinary!
beautiful song, to do things
Bobby Debarge 1978 = Bruno Mars 2021😍 Switch 1978= Silk Sonic 2021🤩
This is gonna be so good at the Grammy's NEXT year!
I already bought the Original version. BRUNO! Pretty PLEASE sell us this one as well?! Then I'd have one for the house & one for traveling...all Silk Sonic, all the time... you know you want to 😘
First off, this man too fine! Both are! That’s A! Second y’all NOT about to call y’all self SILK SONIC! Stop doing y’all face like that knowing damn well it ain’t no album cover no more! Them collars on those shirts TOO BIG!!! Stop pumping y’all fists real hard towards yo chest like that! This is not DeBarge! Sorry had to break they lil asses up real quick!
DAMN!!🔥
i love that even though there wasn’t any fancy like background dancers or choreography, this performance was still AMAZING
Love it!❤
Im so proud of bruno mars and the group!!!! Best performance and presentation ive never seen. Simple oldies and catchy.!
Im here for the complete retro feel of this entire performance 💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾
@ 3:21 when Bruno hit that note...dayum!!!

So happy no egos got in the way of this amazing collaboration.
To me They almost as bad as the Greats Like Earth Wind and Fire and Kool and the Gang.  This Silk Sonic is "Lava" they beyond Fire.
This is music, unlike the stupid rap sht nowadays all about money and booty shit.  This here is pure music for the soul.
Who are the other 2 guys in the back?
Amazing

At a distance Paak looks like Maurice White (one of my all time favorites RIP Mr. Maurice White)
Why did I think he said The Lays, instead of filets.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I'M IN LOVE>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>and I'm a lesbian
The Undisputed tag team champions of soul
Paak glasses makes me love him moreeeeeeeee
Could Melody and great voices be making a comeback?no profanity —I’m old school and this is refreshing!
Makes me think of urban mystic but this was fire. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

No for nothing I have a lot of respect for anderson paak for even having the balls to be on a stage with Bruno.... Beautiful I love to see them playing their instruments and singing... True talent is it back ?
The vocals in this song.... thank you Jesus for these two talented men and bringing them into our lives.
Mark my words..the two responsible for baby making in 2021.
OMG - Anderson .Paak & Bruno seriously bringing SEXXXY backkk with a SOULFUL GROOVE!!!   Prediction: Looking forward to Silk Sonic ruling the radio waves and music awards.
That's is amazing how they captured the spirit of the the 70s and made it Anderson Peak  Bruno Mars Justin Timberlake  Robin thicke New edition BBD  should do an R&B retro concert.
iconic
I really be in my feelings listening to this ❤️❤️
They sound the same without auto-tune. *Sexy*
Anderson voice is so damned Sexy. The whole song is Sexy..yessssss

Y'all noticed Arthist throughout 2019-2021 was giving  us nothing but 60-70's vibes?
My GOD❤️❤️❤️I feel as though they pulled me back to 1978...real music
That classic soul sound will never die.....i want more of this
fire!!!!!
This song is a hit!!!
Soothing #nuffsed
This song is fire
I love that the 70s are back
Grooving to Silk Sonic. 👍👍
Taken me back to when music was music ,sounds like good old school music.from back in the day .60s 70s & 80s and maybe some 90s.
Beautiful!!!!!
All i can say is"  Oh my Damn". With emphasis on the words in quotation
Bruno Mars is a once in a life time talent
OMG! I'M A 55 YEARS OLD FEMALE AND I CAN'T STOP LISTENING TO THIS SONG BRUNO MARS AND ANDERSON PAAK 😍 MUSIC FOR NOW AND THE NEXT GENERATION 🤩
BRUNO MARS soul Brotha #1.. Sexy.. Great singer. OMG I love this style. It's like the 70s remake
I'm always leaving the door open babe 😘
IM SO IN LOVE WITH THIS SONG 🎵😍💕💗💓
Bruno returned for seconds (and I suspect thirds) when God was doling out talent.  He is an unbelievable performer!  I find myself smiling from ear to ear as I delight in his pristine performance.  Thank you Bruno for the joy that you weave into this world.
Love the 70's vibe!
A. BANGER!!!!
😍 FANTASTIC 😍
https://youtu.be/_kFxeqG-dA0

I love this song and video sooooo much a daily wake up for me!!!!
Smiled through the whole song. Straight up cheesing. Lol
❤💯❤
Yassss 🙌🏿🙌🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿🔥🔥🔥🥰🥰 guys this is so fire.  We miss good love music that’s not so explicit as what’s out these days.  I love it, guys 🥰🔥🔥🔥
Usually not a fan of Bruno but this song and performance is so good!
this collab is deadly.
❤️❤️❤️
The "SPIN" somewhere around  0:54 and 0:56. EPIC.
It's just so damn smooth! Geeesh!
Just love it...replay after replay.
I can’t help it...😉😝☺️ Every time I hear and see this sung, I smile and smile. 🙂😊🥰
If you can't trace their DNA back to the Delfonics, something's wrong with you.
Such a jam. Love the vibe
How do they sound better live than the studio version? What kind of socery is this?!
Soooo awsome i wached this on The TV while eating fast food🤩🤩🤩
Bruno...whewwww, this man can sang. His voice is perfection, an this song is beautiful!!!
Love, love and love. Harmony, bridge ,arrangements, nice to listen to good music..
A beautiful performance 😍😍
🔥 🔥 🔥
Maravilhoso ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Now I am a fan. My mother Loves you.  I would say, Who is that? Never heard of you, sorry. This sound, this song, takes me back to the real old school sounds of the early 70's. The Delfonics, The Whispers, and Switch come to my mind when I hear you all singing. I love the clothes that also sets the '70's mood. Not Disco (although I love disco music), simply Great Love Songs. Love It! I could be your mother, but I am comfortable being your newest fan. My mother is more hip than, I.
Bruno is smashing like usual...but for those who don’t know about Anderson; Y’all better stop playing & give that man his flowers!!!
Who's he leaving the door open for exactly? Dominos? Amazon delivery guy? Someone needs to tell him this is a bad neighborhood and he needs to lock that shit.
Has the two backgrounds singers ever got any credit ?? Lol
Only person that sounds better live these days!!!! ❣️
I like Anderson and Bruno together......I like the duo...it's fly!
The 70s have officially made a comeback! Yes!!!!🔥🔥🔥
Brilliant!!!
Watching this performance by Silk Sonic is giving me "Bert Sugarman's Midnight Special with Wolfman Jack" vibes!
Sounds like the delfonics baby  and that's good
Bruh the attention to detail is amazing. The graphic
Choreography is on point
It's crazy how difficult this song is to sing. They are both truly incredible!
Sugar and spice, and everything noice.
And just like that.... all 2021 babies were conceived 🥰🤪  Best song I’ve heard in a long time.
I absolutely love this collaboration, it’s so powerful!!!
Bruno eres genial. Cambiaste mi vida. Espero que lo sepas. love you
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Anderson I just met you through this song.  Come through with it
Love you Lol
🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼 Love this!
Sweet old school jam for summer and beyond. My soul needed this.windows rolled down.!

NICEEEEE🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bruno looks like a very young Sammy Davis Jr.
Damn!! Dave Chapelle got vocals and swag!
3:50 is absolutely the best part! The blending of their voices is so perfect!
"if you're hungry girl, I've got fillets" LMAO. GOLD! I am going to listen to this jam until 2026 at least!

Love, love, love this song, old school done today.  What does this group have to follow this song, can't wait to hear it.  I play it every day.
It must be the Filipino in him that got him so gangster.. smooth like butter
Bruno Mars has arrived from my perspective. Finally this is a song I can get down with. Despite his Musical versatility his sound and style was very annoying because it reminded me of Disney Bubblegum Music.. Until now!  Anderson, Paak, Silk Sonic collaboration is definitely phenomenal. Well done.
"I got the haze (purple haze) and if you're hungry I got the Lays"
OH MY!!!! OMG!!! This is so beautiful!! Truly a beautiful brand new 70s era HIT!!! I could listen to this over and over Again!!! The song, the style, Like Magic!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Lorddddd yes, This is music ❤❤❤❤
Anderson brought exactly what this song needed 😫😫😫 I keep replaying the first verse.
Bruno... just🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 that voice👏 they are true talent!.
I love this ♥️♥️♥️💯💯💯
This smooth just like the good old days
Soooooooo smooth
Too dangerous to listen and not love
Taking me right back to the era of 1970s Philly soul… But even better this time around!! 👍 #LetSilkSonicThrive
The "shut your mouth" gets me every time. Great song though
So glad that ol school is coming back. And what  better artists than Bruno Mars and Silk! They be bringing it straight!
If you grew up in the hood, these were the jams you were used to....🔥🔥🔥

The 2k haters of this song fuck animals a sexual people do you lol
They're one of my dream collabs and I'm so happy this is the result 😩
Who are the people that obviously don't like music, that commented on this.  Hope they found the "conspiracy video" they were looking for.
This is the best thing I’ve seen in years
Love this song so 70s I wish I could have grown up in the 70s I love bell bottoms.  Go bruno
Anderson is so dope! Bruno is a nice compliment. They sound amazing live!
I seen a lot of covers of this song, I just realize how original Paaks voice is
Y'all did that!! LOVE It!!!
I didn't see this! You all got this. This is what's missing!!
3:07
This song sounds like the real old school jams. I like it.

Im so here for this type of 🎵 coming back 😍
I’m gonna leave my open for silk sonic
Holy!!! the live version is even better. this is heavenly wow
THIS is REAL music!!!  NOT disgusting songs like "WAP"!! I mean, REALLY?!?!
I’ve watched this 18 times in a row and I think I should stop now 😂 there has to be an end but when?! I can’t stop
Justin Timberlake: “I’m bringing sexy back.”  Silk Sonic: “Sheeeeeeeeet !!!”
Got that Switch/Confunkshun/Cameo Vibe!  This performance reminds me of Switch, when they would dance to move to different instruments! I hope this means SILK SONIC is coming out with a whole album and not just this single???
This is incredible.
I love this song so muchhhh
I’m so addicted....
Flawless!! Flawless victory!
fuck yes 🥰
Im so happy to see that someone decided to bring the old feel of music back.. sounds so good to hear a love song. Sadly its whats missing in todays music!!!!!!!❤️❤️❤️🥰🥰🥰 loving the group!! Bruno mars ive always loved your music. But silk sonic... yall really bad!!!❤️😂🥰🥰
Singgggggggggggg👏👏👏
I love it, you go brothers.💯
Popcorn players...macaroni!
Absolutely perfect
Old school sound,sounds great
yasssss, Let's bring back slow dancing!!!
3:53 is pure sex.
😍 Hi baby ☺️
Bruno did Bruno. Anderson did Anderson. Perfect!!!
I watch this amazing video again and again and again. They are perfect!!
I just love this talented little guy!
0:43 when Anderson hit that note, I thought that was Bruno the first time I heard it.
Yeesssssssss
I've watched anderson in concert a few times...he sang his ass off in this performance. Love it.
Saaaaaannnnggggggggggg Bruno 💃🏽💕💕
Now this is what I call real Music I’m 40 years old and half of the stuff from my generation I don’t want to be playing when I’m 60 back in the day feel good vibes type of music
The song fucking slaps!
Best song of 2021🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yeah buddy!!! Bring that old school vibe back.  Do it my brothas!!!
Awestruck
So 2 k down must be drug addicts  this should have more views
Damnnnn they did that!!! That’s what I call REAL MUSIC
Now that put a smile on my face! Such a sexy song :-)
It was better because we got to see them moving while singing this bomb ass song!   We call this real music 🎵
3:18 When Bruno hit that note, i was like  *marry me now!!!*💕✨
I hear some Stevie Wonder and defintely Michael Jackson from Mars albeit a lower cooler tone to his voice.
I looovvveee this song!!! This one will definitely be playing in my music rotation at my wedding reception
This is unreal….
Bruno Mars is a genius n a great artist he should be artists of the year to me he has his own style of music in his own league
One of the BEST live performers to EVER do it👏👏👏🥰🤌
This is the BEST live performance I have seen in YEARS!!
A Lil bit of Old School💕
Never liked Bruno but Anderson is that dude so I gave it a try not disappointed
Cheap video with cheap ass fucking additions shit!  Could this song be any cheaper and nastier?
Bruno Mars sounds too good omg i get goosbumps
Smooth
YAAASSS!!!! Y’all betta SANG!!! Two beautiful soulful voices!!!
I'm madly in love with this song!!!
This was live please I knew this was a video.  Flawless performance. I'm blessed to view
What if other "talented" artist took the challenge and did an original throwback song?  No twerking or nudity. Just Talent with a fun, positive message
Here I am watching this again and just feeling the need to say just how good this is. If this was baseball this would be a game winning Grand Slam!!! Damn we need more music like this. Im not talking necessarily the same genre I'm talking about quality! In the 1980s for example we had many variants of what we would hear in Pop music. Such diversity from Michael Jacksons Billy Jean to TKAs Maria. For you yunggins that don't know TKA I highly recommend you look them up their music is what we refer to as " freestyle" now a days. But back then it was all just good. We had Culture Club and Run D MC. I mean it was really great quality music. This song is just as good as any massive hit from back then. Come on musicians and artist get your game up and bring on real quality music. Don't follow the trends buck the system do something unusually awesome!
Omg love this song by Bruno Mars
Oh hey camera man! I almost forgot this is live thought this is a music video
HolleMary Briggs
This is the only 63rd Grammys performance that has pure talent. But some performances on the 63rd are trash (you know who they are). I wish in future Grammys please it should be pure talent just like the old days.
Need that concert dates already
Who's here for the bombass O'Jays/Temptations/Four Tops choreography??
I miss Bruno mars so much. He is so flawless. Seen him live he is freaking awesome. He Sounds better in person. If you get a chance to see a concert you should do it. As soon as he announce a concert in Las Vegas I'm going.
Has a old school sound, this is a hit
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
im smiling while listening to this song. That's rare.
mmmmm yes to it all, love this song
After listening to this amazing trac I wish I had a significant alpha male in my life!!!!!!
Anderson has that old school showmanship! I can’t wait to see this group get 10+ No. 1’s and you know they will
You can wear whatever you want when you have a voice like that, but I gotta say I’m diggin’ his Little Richard mustache 😂
@3:21 Jesus take it easy you can’t just hit us like that
The song you slow dragged to at the 70's blue lights in the basement house party
Wow!! they absolutely smashed it!!!! Jesus
BRUNO WHY DON'T YOU DO A COLLABORATION WITH KZ TANDINGAN ?
Please... God.. if you're up there.. please have Silk Sonic put out an entire album.
Nobody gonna mention the 360 spin they both did at the same time
Bruno looks like a baby ☺️ he’s adorable
Bruno, always coming through with the high vocals! 👏👏👏
Those are some mighty fine young men right there 🔥🔥❤❤
Beautiful
I Love this performance
Yes love it yyyyyyyyyyesseeeessss
like damn
Sing it bruno
💘 this
It’s called silk sonic not Bruno Mars people smfh
This version is definitely better than the studio version. I especially liked Anderson's hesitation on the lyrics in the beginning of the song.
bruno mars you are a spectacular performer and this duo with anderson is truly music that opens up your heart and throat chakra. so amzing and i love singing it everyday
How did y'all perfect something that was already perfect? I CANNOT get enough of this.
Damn I didn’t know agent could hit notes like that
Love the retro suits!
Anderson.Paak: "And if you're hungry, girl I got filets."  Me: passes out
Please come to Salt Lake City Utah

The man is ridiculously talented! He’s so creative and he pulls amazing these out of his peers
I LOVE THIS!!!
Is he saying “filets” or “Da Lays”?
I just love Bruno Mars!!! this was a smart move with a new song and group....it's really smooth and lovely too!!!
Sing! Nothing like that old school feeling. Love it!
They took that shit back to old Jackson 5 in the 70’s🎼🎼🎼👍❤️
1:57 I'm dying I'm dying I'm dying
One of the first songs that I can truly say is magical
This is how I am winding down  after work, It came on the radio as well. Loving it ❤️
I love the dress suits
LA LA LA AAAAAA LA LAAA LA LAAAAAAAAH AHAAAA
You hear that rumble???  That's , Eddie Kendricks, Dave Ruffin, Harry Ray, Al Goldman , Eugene Record. Marvin Gaye....and  other lost members of the OJays, Teptations. Whispers, Chi Lites, Blue Notes, Blue Magic etc. Looking down and singing along with approval...saying. "Yeah, Baby...its about time to sing some good R&B with great lyrics again"!...🎶🎤🎶
This is the collab we didn’t know we needed! Love these two!
Earned the hell out of my like!
If you’re wondering, it’s not just you listening over and over. Every time I pick up my phone lately I hit play. My mood music, morning, noon and night, ❤️🥰😍
Love this 🦋🦋🦋🦋
This song 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Andersen & Bruno Mars bring love back in the right way. Trae Young Atlanta Hawks player look like Bruno Mars 🤣

Absolute eargasmic masterpiece. The visuals, wardrobe, singers, dance moves..... bloody brilliant. 🔥👏🏾🔥👏🏾🔥👏🏾
Second Billboard number one song so far this year from artists of Filipino descent...#PinoyWave

l love these song
THIS IS THE BEST SONG OF 2021.  IF I'M WRONG COME BACK TO MY COMMENT IN 2022 ON THIS DAY APRIL 12TH AND MAKE ME OUT A LAIR! I'LL BE WAITING.🙏🏾💋
LEAVE IT OPEN BABY I'M COMING!!!!🥰❣💅🏾💅🏾🍷😏💋
Anderson .Paak is giving me Dave chapelle vibes lol
Finally!!!!!! Music my children can listen to when they mature (get to my age) and want to listen to "old school music". LOVE THIS!
Dopeness! Classic🔥🔊
Love 💘 this!!!
I just can’t stop listening song!
Classy! Smooth! Love Love Love! My mom would have loved it! Bruno was her favorite artist. RIP Mom!!❤
So gay omg
This what you call music 🎉🎉🎉
Those voices together!!! Love it!!!
they perform so good live, it`s amazing. My new favorite song.
I love Bruno Mars I love this song in I just can't stop listen to this  Ima buy his cloths 😂🤣
i need more men to realize how damn attractive this kind of energy is
I can't  see how  people  think the weekend  is more talented  than  Bruno, I don't  see it
For some reason, I laugh at this song...but I absolutely love it! It’s my new favorite song...smooth lil vibe!
Damn its a good time to be alive.
Esta presentación es genial
Amazing.
Reminds me of the 70s☺️
Thanks God Bruno performed in the Grammys...
Okay, but y'all see that Bruno packin?
Opening the door to old school beautiful music. Hook them Young ones and change their mind!
Them Steps were proper.
Luv this ..takes me back to my childhood when we had to clean on the weekends lol .. thank u Bruno. And Anderson ... luv ur music
THIS JUST IN.... PREGNANCIES HAVE GONE UP 80% .
I literally hate that people call Anderson.PAAK A rapper. He’s literally always singing, but he has bars. Did they call James Brown a rapper? Or Marvin Gaye? Or Stevie Wonder?? They all had bars and they never specified their genre!!! PAAK is the light we all need. In a Jackson type of way. He will be the greatest.
vocals... live Live LIVE... L I V E!
is it possible for him to sing out of tune? short answer- NO
Wow
this song just gets better and better
This is gonna be hard to top.. Go for it!! 💯💪
I'm praying that Bruno and A.P. can change the music industry with this joint collaboration.
Performance was amazing! Glad real music is back!
Woah. Yeah!!  Sounds like a tribute to a favorite legend from 50 years ago....it has such quality and style....just like the "Stylistics"  with Russell Thompkins jr...I can see and hear similar chords. Choreography, harmony that is so much like.the  Stylistics and falsetto is amazing.  Great sound in the midst of crap music era.  Good job Bruno and Silk!  Keep it up. I bet Russ is glad to see this come about again.  Good R&B love songs with decent lyrics.    🎶🎤🎶
People always say they don't make music like they used to, well here you go.
EVERYTHING about this song is RIGHT...the clothing, the setting, the tempo....EVERYTHING!
I can't stop watching 😩😩😍
HOLY SHT THEY KILT THIS🔥
Anderson's and Bruno's Vocals🎉💕💕😩🥺
S**t so f*****g fire
best Grammy performance
Marvin Gaye would have played this tune when his lady came over to add another level of smoothness to the night ... Yep, Its that smooth.
This song honestly gets Me in the mood lol
🎶🎶Ayeee ayeee ayeee ayeee 🎶🎶y’all did that!!  Bruno, you “BAD!”
They killed I am going to leave my door open for you guys straight from New Orleans loving it 🤗🤗🤗❤❤❤
I can say I really love this song they really sound so good 💗😘💕💕💘🤗
Love the old school feel!
For all the people who disliked  you are mad that this was a good performance
Omg 😍😍😍😍
Damn!
I love this song so much
This is like old school vibe but new school at the same time. 🔥
The most smooth sexiest song ever
Look like my dad and my uncles from way back!!! Pinoy Pride
This is that 🔥! I'm hearing Delfonics, Marvin, EWF and Switch. Real music.
When I watched this live Grammy’s version, just before he and Anderson finished the song together, with his hand out Bruno sings to her “Girl I’m here just waiting for you, come on over I’ll adore you.” His voice was soft, intimate and enticing. He really knows how and when to say what women want to hear. He knows EXACTLY what he's doing. 😊 ❤️ 🎼Bless his heart.
Bruno mars must be protected at all cause he's a national treasure
Ima leave the door open::
;/;
Bruno was on 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
They can have awwlllll my pannies I LOBE THIS!!!
Love This Song❤
So thankful for the good music he gives us
3:33 til the end I’m literally sitting here crying Sooooo beautiful
They killed it!!💕💕💕👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Back in the 60s and the 70s this is how music used to sound nowadays I don't know what they be playing out here good job Bruno Mars
did y'all know Anderson Paaak was from XXL
This song is the top song ever this is how R&B music supposed to be played
I love Bruno Mars songs
“Ima leave the door uuuuuuhhhpen” 😂 this performance is AMAZING though!! Respect!
this song is from fortnite the guy from fortnite with his own dance
🔥🔥🔥 Anderson.Paak vocals are SMOOTH!!! WOW! 💯💜🥁🎶
And now I’m pregnant 🤰
Everybody saying Bruno but Anderson made this performance here. Together they’ve made a instant classic masterpiece
Silk Sonic is all heart!!!!
Whenever live concerts are permitted again...May we please have one with them, Charlie Wilson and Smokey Robinson, Babyface, Jazmine Sullivan, H. E. R., Queen Naija, and Ella Mai... I'm sure I missed someone. But my heart and underwear drawer can only handle but so much.
Collaborate with Ed sheeran!!!!🙏
Damn! 🔥🔥🔥
Im dying laughing 🤣 😆 😂
LMAOOO Pak at the end: "woobwhoobwhoobwoobyuuuu"  Love it
Got those Delfonics/Stylistics vibes
Perfection. ( 🎤 drop)
They absolutely slayed this live performance!!!  Gave me chills!!  Hearing this live version for the first time.  I'll be listening to both radio and live performance back to back now!!😌
Bruno Mars be packing 😳
Amazing...your voices...thank you
I miss this type of music
Hands down best song out right now!!
Love this performance so so much
Masterpiece!
Thank you so much for this beautiful song. It is a musical masterpiece ♪♫
I can’t believe Anderson went from that free style with Lil dicky and all of the other rappers which was trash to being the most amazing singer I love his voice his notes especially on the lyrics “ I’m waiting waiting waiting”
Simply beautiful 😻🥰🤩
Hit those notes yall 😛😛😛🕺🕺🕺YEEEEES
DOPE!

Why are bruno mars songs relaxing
Got darn it! This jam is soooo  smooth and Romantic.. I haven't heard real music like this in so long, just can't get enough of this song...   really puts u n da mood...    it's ON FIRE 🔥
Woowuhwuhwoowoowoowoo
I don't really consider myslef a Bruno Mars or an Anderson .Paak fan, but this has to be my favorite song of the five years at least.
I’m in the shower hitting every note tho!
Just when you think nothing could top the original. The live kills the original😩😩😩🔥🔥🔥🔥
Death Duo
It takes me back to when I fell in love with the love of my life Tyrone Davis... R I.P.  THIS SONG IS SO POWERFUL I CAN FEEL HIS SPIRIT IN MY HEART WITH EVERY VERSE THEY SING.  I just can't stop playing it over & over... This is truly a master peice!!!!!!Thanks 4 reminding me of what real love feels 👍 like!!!!!
Its obvious who the superstars is, and its very nice of him to share the stage 😂😂
This is now my new favorite song... like I’ve literally listened to this song back to back to back🤦🏽‍♀️
Congratulations Bruno, A. Paak & Silk Sonic for having the No.1 song on the Billboard Hot 100. Now drop the album already.
This song sends off dopamine chemicals in the brain, you can't help but  listen to it again and again. I listen on the way to work and on the way home then sing it in the shower.😂❤
Bruno been bringing fire 🔥 his 24k album was also fire... loved the whole album. Anything he touches is Platinum... just my 80’s baby opinion!
Who is the man with the beard tho
What magical time machine from 1974 did these guys crawl out of?
im waiting for you....
I love me some r&b❤️
We getting our women back...
STRESS = 2021 $$ We're a nation of frazzled families  With little time for personal affection. As the treadmills of tension keep us hostage  We're losing our perspective of direction.  Racing to get the kids off to school,  Navigating the madness of bottleneck traffic. Fearful of our own job-loss and income,  While the newscasts get more hopeless and graphic.  Helping our children with their homework Scrambling to prepare their dinner.  Having family spats with loved ones And being told on Sunday, we're a sinner.  Worrying about crime, taxes, cancer and terrorism  Infectious disease and paying next month’s bills. Saving for college and our own retirement It's no wonder we drink, smoke, pray and pop pills.

Am I crying? Yes
This is that Jacksom 5, Motown music going on. I can listen to this all day.

LOVE THIS
Bruno Mars is the goat
Wondering how many people started listening to Anderson Park now.  Suggest you start with  Link up and progress from there
Weather you say 70's sound 80's or whatever this is a masterpiece I remember first hearing ceelo green ft melanie Fiona I'm a fool before they released it and said it was a masterpiece and look at the success of that track this track is a on that level maybe exceed it a little, but the album over will win a ton of awards guarantee
Mr anderson park has a beautiful sound to his voice mixed with mr mars they're trying to bring real soul back to the music great keep it up we need the soul back into music to feel the love we miss it and will welcome it peace.
This is everything 🙌
I think is playback
These two are brothers and you can’t convince me they’re not. Heard an interview with the two together and they are straight IGNANT!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Beautiful song. Keep this one on repeat.
I just can’t get enough ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
.... Yall know Anderson in the song too right?
O. M. G!! Holy moly!!! Goosebumps. This was phenomenal

Fabulous!  The soul, the groove, the vocals.. #originalmusicrocks
You guys are great. Always heard the name Bruno Mars... But never Anderson Paak. A little out of touch working 7 days a week. Man love you guys together.
The pink zone generically push because herring classically compete in a romantic level. capable, zesty ptarmigan

Bruno Mars is a legend
The fact that his music is made using actual instruments and not just computer generated sounds 😍😍
Mannnn this duo Silk Sonic album is gonna be NAAAAAASSSSTTTYYYYYYYY!!! Between the vocals and the vibes it's gonna be a BANGER!
My 15 year old  twins  hip me  to this  i fell in love  with  it
Just got home from work and i put this song on my loud speaker in my room and feel this song right now. I am tired but i am enjoying this song so much. The beat is great and Bruno and Anderson Paak vocal is great.

I- bruno only uses a lil bit of auto tune to stop the cracking dAyUm UwU
I love this song ... this is my favorite song
In love with Bruno😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Marvin Gaye is smiling😘from heaven
Real music
The enchanted bench chemically gaze because desire commercially smash like a obscene hurricane. resolute, chivalrous rose
This is so Romantic that a 55 y.o friend sends it as a "you need to listen  to the word's " 💯 ❤ ahem young lady 🥰😅😁😁 flirty flirty kiss 💋. Thanks for the Melody Bruno Mars.
I’m tell my kids this was the temptations
Bruno you coming to dc soon to perform, hope you do
Bruno and Anderson pakk litterally NEVER miss.
Jackson 5 Vibes!
Yasssss my type of jam
Bruno so dam cool & sexy. Reminds we of a younger version of Prince. Can’t leave out the guys in the back 🔥. So love this song
Bruno Mars was reincarnated idc he’s a musician from the 70’s he’s so smooth & soulful
Bruno and Pak killed it!!! Amazing!!!!
Love this performance
O.M.G.....jus a beautiful song and performance. The video is good, but this was jus perfect..excellent work guys!
Yassssss Baby !!!!! This song is so dam smooth I play this daily when I just need to groove to something the vibes coming from this song make ya feel good !! 😍😍😍😍😘😏💕💕💕💕💕👏🏼
I love this💃💃💃
A touch of old school here. The music, choreography, clothes, and look at that Afro.  LOL.  Love it!  Makes me want to pull out my favorite old school jams.
Holy WOW! fantastic song.
The tender tense australia concordantly peep because gazelle syntactically wander of a impartial thread. tasteful, tearful stranger
This is so so good. Wish the band was in the video though in the background.
This is the new "official" video version now!
My Lord!!!
Got that O’jays vibe going on 🥰
They as a group and individually are bringing back real musicianship, instrumentation, melodies, harmonies, choreography and etc. "Button pushing" is ok but....The harder the grind/practice the greater the product & productivity of the art. Unless its just God-given talent that seems effortless. Love these guys for being able to do both!
I thought Bruno sung the whole song 😳
Bruno Mars hit those notes even better.
Interesting that people think Bruno Mars is better... like comparing Beyoncé to Erykah Badu. One touches the masses why the other touches the souls. Both are great in their own way and compliment each other well ! Just be quiet and enjoy the music 🙄🎵
Bruno got that old school feel It’s evident in a lot of his music which is why this old lady loves him
So good to hear good music again!
The three piece suit is on the scene again such a beautiful melody...I just love it.
Bruno Mars is a goat
Just beautiful 😩
✊🏽
I love this song so romantic
Amazing song smooth as silk
Repeat, this vibe is Everything
Iconic...mark my words
This is some romancing haha
That was EVERYTHING!!!!!!!!
Whoever thought to put them together will get a huge hug from me....didn’t know I needed this until I did, love them
Yeeeessss!!!! My favorite song right now!!!
Yes
Right now Bruno Mars is today's best entertainer.
Awesome!
I was crying throughout the whole thing😭 I love Bruno mars!

Thanks guys for giving me the inspiration to start writing and recording again, that great inspiring music right there 👏
I love it
This got me thinking of the JACKSON 5
1970's all the WAY !!!! YES !!!!!
Michael Jackson's successor
Anderson .Paak voice reminds me of Ralph Tresvant, but better.
J
Yes yes yes
Dude I’m crying, this is beautiful

This video brought me back to them days when   I was sneaking out to just play these types of music at a friends place ...I was time traveling to my teen days until the music stopped. ..😔
Anderson Pac favor Dave Chapelle in this video
My 19 year old and I sung the heck out of this on a recent trip to an ice cream parlor and I could not help but think, these two men are binding generations with this hit. Additionally, it just makes you feel good and after the last year and a half, that is exactly what I needed. Thanks, Silk Sonic!
Finally a song I can tell kids they don't nothing about in the future
Old school just came back ✌️
Me: imma leave the door open Silk sonic: gotchu Me: Purrrrrrr😌
I NEED THIS ALBUM IN MY LIFE
I love his old style.  I hope he never changes.  He reminds me of Al Green
Good music again!!!! Love it
Lol love it 💪🏾
How the hell did Montero go to #1 over this gem?
exquisite
The first verse for me
The 1.9k dislikes are probably the ones who can't sing, and are envious of that fact. To add, and probably listen to mumble rap trap music all day. SMH. You darn millennials.
1, 2, 3 double spin!
Bruno is one gorgeous man 💞
I can't stop watching this piece of art
Are they seriously not lip syncing...
im addicted to music like this. bruno never disappoints. and good job to anderson hes KILLING IT. the back up choir people in the back are recognized too :)
I need more of this plss..😭😭😭😭
This song is a true Cut plus  hilarious at the same time..  LOW KEY : I almost was waiting at the end for them to say LADIES & GENTLEMEN...GIVE IT UP FOR SEXUAL CHOCOLATE... 😳
Producer: So how much autotuner? Bruno: Whats that?
Only a person that smokes good weed can produce & sing a song this great.
We don’t deserve them omg 😍😍😍
I'm glad they got together to make a classic
I come back to this daily and replay repeatedly. ♥️🔥
Please... keep this 70's revival going on for a long time... I love it... finally some natural clean sounds...
Bruno and his band never misses a beat.
imagine seeing this outside your window
Can y’all put this version on iTunes and Spotify?
I am a 62 year old African American female I have seen this video over and over this is what you call good music thank you to Bruno Mars and Anderson Paak.
🎵I Ain’t playing no games every word that I say is coming strait to your heart

Bruno stayed in the groove and the theme of the song. Anderson is doing too much running. This is groovy funk song.
my soul love this song they belong together
everyone talking abt bruno by himself here... YALL NOT HEARING ANDERSON'S FALSETTO??? AAAAAAAAAAAAAA             like damn this is so good had me in tears highkey T^T
Anyone else catch a little bit of a Tyler the creator vibe on the drums
This sh*t is sooo damn smooth!
The Temptations, The Stylistics, Enchantment...that's what this song and video puts me in the mind of...that's the stuff Anderson and Bruno's MOTHER'S generation used to listen to...they even got the bell-bottomed pants and wide-collar shirts right...like I said in my last comment...long live Ol' Skool!!!
Oh
Ol'Skool ..where all the REAL music comes from; those who know, know...Bass, Drums, Keys, Guitar...any of you young whippersnappers know what those are? That's what y'alls syths & drum machines are designed  from, FYI..that stands for "For Your Information."
This is like an oldie!  I love it
Anderson and Bruno got a David Ruffin and Eddie Kendricks feel
I am so in love with Bruno Mars....
@:55 the the smoothest transition ever.
how can one man be this talented
Live singing is back again because of anderson and bruno and silk sonic. Job well done period end of story.
Bruno and anderson are singers with no autotune as you can see.i love there live performance and i hope these musicians and singers learn from them that its better to sing live and play instruments instead of cumputer make beats which will never sound good period.
Congratulations mr anderson and mr bruno. You're now part of the hall of fame of beautiful 70s music classic with the like likes of the chi lites,stylistics,delfonics temptations,the dells  and the great smokey robinson and the Jackson five with the greatest of them all michael Jackson.
why would anyone dislike this? Oh yeah Haters.
Bruno and anderson got it right and look how they have the world singing like crazy.i loved it like crazy.
No doubt about these are singers and players of instruments. Anderson and bruno will fo down as the best of there generation to have ever done it period.
Rewinding The Clock With This One 🔥🔥🔥
When you sing it like you mean it.
This song touches my soul
He killing it
6,000,000 people watched this. Why, because Anderson and Bruno are fire

I love love love this song!
The best vocals of 2021!
Yes, yes, yes...
Only reason to watch an award show.
None of these guys were born when this style of music came out...Maybe this comes natural to some...
God did that and He had them run with it!!!  God bless everyone and if there is anyone who wants to accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior; all you have to do is believe in Him and confess your faith in Him! If you believe that He is the Son of God and died for your sins, was buried but He rose again..you are saved (Confess this also)! God (The Father, The Son, and The Holy Spirit) loves you! There is no one that can do you like God can and there is no other God but God! Stick with God and trust in Him always! God is always on your side! God is a good God and He will never leave nor forsake you! Spread the Gospel always as a child of God and show this world Jesus Christ always in the way that you live your life🙌🏾👑✝❤🙏🏾Stay ready for Jesus' Coming!!
This is a GREAT SONG...I just love it love it..."Tell me that your comin soon."
BRUHH THEY SOUND AMAZING!!!!!!!!
An ode to the OLD SCHOOL‼️‼️
The Best
🗣Got that old school 70's beat like the Moments not on the outside and a wealth of other great artist from the 70's. Anything Bruno Mars create is fire!💃🕺
I freaking love it!!!!!
Bruno got some buldge going on
I WANT ANDERSONS SUNGLASSEEES
Anderson is his own genius. Anderson and Bruno created this masterpiece. Pay respect to both equally people.
😍😍😍And people keep saying they want "old Bruno" back🙄
Imma leave the door opeeennnnnnnn   me: why not close it what if it's cold outside?  but still this is a great song
Bruno is an absolute beast on vocals. His best instrument by far. #Quality
What the world has forgotten about expressing good wholesome LOVE our elders knew what was up just stream some oldies and you'll know what am talking about and its universal has no language barriers.
Bring music back Bruno 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
The end is the best part. I love how they turned the dynamics all the way down and featured their voices
Hot..........just.....
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE IT🤩
Omg I looooooooooove this. Yes Bruno take me back hon. Looking like some new school Dramatics.
I just need to hug Bruno... and never let go... 😩❤
This brings back memories of 4 Tops, Delfonics, Whispers! Love it ❤️❤️❤️
These two together are legitimately dangerous and I mean in that in a good way. Their vocals compliment each greatly.
I swear someone told Anderson and bruno they could not bring back soul love songs and they said, "hold my Courvoisier......brb"
I love them Bruno is trying to bring back the best music and he’s doing amazing 😌
Love it! My two favorite artists ❤️❤️
Everytime I hear this song I smile like a teenager in love.... love vibe 😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰
The love I have for this song ❤❤❤
We need more influenced 70s music/videos 😩🤎🤎🇲🇽
BRINGING SOUL BACK BABY! PLEASE MORE!
💃🏽🕺🏾❤️🥰
I half expect the chorus to break into, "strawberry champagne on ice"
Just call this song of the year already... 🤣🤣
Bruno Mars doing this for the 70s babies  👶
Bruno please marry me
Life is good!
Lyrics are trash but they are both amazing singers .
2:59 $$$ 🤩 My favorite part
The ending was legendary
When u song like the song on the album in live performance that mean u can sing 👍👍👍👍
The 70s are definitely back with this song. Music arrangements, steps, shirt collars, flared pants. Great job Silk Sonic!
Bruno looking like Sammy Davis Jr.
we like fortnite!!!!!!
That switch up between Anderson and Bruno was smooth 💯
Yessss Ole School at it's Finest!!
Bruno Mars is a beast!    Little touch from now and from the past! Keep it up, you are one the BEST!
I literally have to hear thid song a 100x a day! I love this song so much!
This they music here!!!  Keep it coming BRUNO!!!!  YOU CAN BLOW!
Jesus Bruno better sing 🥰🥰🥰🥰 I love 60s, 70s, etc music. I love this kind of music.
I think my favorite part of the live performance is Bruno jumping around like the Holy Spirit's taking over right before the big note.
Beautiful love this song
This is giving off motown vibes. Reminds me of the temptations. Love this song.
They took it back to the old days 💯 I love it
Not Bruno looking like the sugar daddy of my dreams wow
Bruno Mars: *sings his soul out  Anderson Paak: Woowoowoowoo 4:09
This is a masterpiece 😻
I feel like Anderson is so underrated in this song, He is amazing his smooth vocals motioned filled voice, and jazzy attitude
I hate how everyone is saying “Bruno is bringing music back” ITS NOT ONLY BRUNO HE SAID SILK SONIC THEY ARE A GROUP A BAND THEY WORK TOGETHER ITS NOT ONLY BRUNO NOTICE HOW IT DOESNT SAY FT
So damn good ❤
Something like the temps vocals on point wardrobe on point
The "smooth like a newborn"👶 part still makes me laugh.😂

Detroit style 😎
Shit feels like new edition would make this
My new favorite thing to do is listen to this song atles 10xs a day!!! Absolute perfection ❤️

I love this! Maybe because I’m old school R&B
Pure talent
This song makes me cry and it's not even a sad song. Just tears of joy talent like this exists and I am alive to hear it.
🤔Anderson Paak looks like Dave Chappelle doing a Bruno Mars impression 🤷🏽‍♂️
Bruno mars.. I will be the next to walk through your music you've shared. This is beautiful congratulations for another hit
These cats get it..... we'll be watching their versus battle someday and it'll be epic!
Wow this is more of a song that should've been on soul train, like this song
🔥🔥🔥
I’ve listened to this song so much until it’s embarrassing. I love it. I love the clothes, the dance movements. I’m so very proud of Silk Sonic. I will be getting the album. It made me get up and stop being so cripple.
Can someone tell me if they’re lip syncing? Cause wow their voices are like velvet 😍 so smooth
No doubt, No doubt about it!!!
AMAZINGGG SONG! On repeat!! I swear every single of Bruno Mars songs are a hit! So talented!
JESUS CANT STOP REPLAYING THE YOUUUUUUU- OH OH OOOOOOOO

By far the best thing that has ever happened is this style of music
Men! neatly dressed, great voices, coordinated moves, CLASSIC!! Has anyone else played this video as much as I have. This takes me back to when music was music and lyrics made sense and songs were about love, tenderness and not just sex.
Perfekt omgggg
Should i just die from Bruno’s voice or what omg such a talent
IM LEAVE THE DOOR OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOPEN
"Im waiting, waiting, waiiting for yooouu.." Me too---meee too!! 🤣🤣  Best performance! Much aloha! ❤❤

This is so awesome this soul music right here
I just cant
This is a bright spot in a dark time for R&B.
I near lost my mind behind this performance.  Great music and great performances at back baby!
You can’t tell me they killed this
This is definitely nothing like anything else on the radio...I can't stop listening to it. I'm amazed. It definitely has that old school group feel that's going to stand the test of time
I love this song and Bruno looks like a brown skinned Sammy Davis Jr.😄
Greatness yo .. 💯🔥

My favorite song right now! Best collaboration in years.
Can someone have tristan react to this live version
Damn that was so good!!! 🔥🔥🔥
This is a beautiful song
My hidden Puerto Rican people. Leave your door open. But you can't never hide it from yourself

WHY DO PEOPLE HAVE TO PUT THE THUMBS DOWN ? JUST TAKE THE THUMBS DOWN OFF  AS AN OPTION !!! DON'T NOBODY CARE IF YOU DON'T LIKE  THIS SONG !!!  SHA'MONE !( SAY THE WORD QUICKLY IN THE VOICE OF MICHAEL JACKSON..."SHA'MONE" SOUNDS LIKE  SHA- MOAN) THIS $#¡% IS UH HIT 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ooooooohh i like that!
Let's take a moment to acknowledge all 1.8k hacks who disliked this song and performance.🤣🤣 Literally Smdh..🤦‍♀️
This song is fire. It has the old school vibe.  When entertainers could actually sing, were well dressed and had that sexy swag.
I <3 Btuno Mars ❤❤❤
My daddy had that suit!!!Great music!!!!
R   &    Bv at its best
I fxcking CONIC!!!!!!
Sing it fellas!! Non of that mumbling nonsense!!!!!

Good vibes and love............!
I was literally hypnotized watching this.
I love this song. It's a old song that sounds like this but I just can't put my finger on it 🤔🤔
Dope
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤❤❤❤❤❤
I know I ain’t the only one that see it 👀
Only Bruno can do this song and Thank GOd for that !!!
This record is diamond no certification needed.  Fight me
I can’t stop playing this song!
They need to make more song like this bring the oldies back
They bodied this performance
Love this song and my heart is filled with love
This song is the S😍😩🥰
Best duo I’ve heard in a long while perfection at its finest
Girl I got the laaaAaays, get it!! 💜💜🎶🎵😭😂
This is that classic old school for the new school !! When I heard this on the radio the first time, it was like fireworks omg 3:03 car stereo blasting
I feel like little girl again sitting in front of the 1 television we had and watching this performance on Soul Train.
The longing accountant paradoxically scold because bobcat realistically yell since a important scarf. curvy, swanky risk
They need to make a movie after this.. Giving me Sparkle and Dream Girls vibes 🥰🥰
Thumbs down?? Really??? 🤔
~SILK SONIC~
Temptation feel. I loved every minute of their performance. Love the outfits and Bruno I love your hair. He is absolutely gorgeous.
#1I LOVE THIS! 💘💯❤👑👍😘
Pure Magic✨
AWESOME.STRAIGHT FACTS.
Are you f'n kidding me...I absolutely love the original...and THEN THEY GO AND DO this...bravo, bellissimo
Silk sonic for life
Love Love Love ❤️❤️❤️
That dreamy, airy, old-school Motown tempo is heavily influenced by Diana Ross and The Supremes mixed with The Temptations - Guaranteed. Even without the lyrics the music still tells a story. Everything they did worked extremely well and makes this an excellent song!
Keep Walkin Like You're Goin Somewhere by Corney Mims f/ OG Los DaAddict is FIRE!
bruno will always be my idol lol
Thank god we still got somebody doing real music!!!
I'd like to see Stokely from Mint Condition do something with them.
Bringing back the 70s
BRUNO IS SO SEXY OVE THIS SONG
Whoever put a thumbs down has "NO EARS" or soul and is musically challenged...smh HATERS!
NOSTALGIA
Love it
“Everyone needs auto tune to sound good these days” Bruno: Hold my suit
Man oh man this talent here! This is absolutely amazing and I love the song, the vibe, how it connects you. Just great music....
Left my vid on 480p and it became 4K.
it’s the guy from fortnite, he’s wearing red, kinda sus 😳😳😳😳😳
Wow love it !!!
I am 63 yrs young Loving the outfits takes me to my era 70s may sound silly alright nah
For some reason, I cannot get enough of this song!!  It's like mixed with decades of soul, r & B, all in one.
Soo many the temptations vibes 💕
Hows the live version better than recording? Wowwoowweewowwow.
Bruno his every single friken note
I just received the CD of Leave the Door Open. Lovin' it!!!
Kids only watched this cause of fortnite 🤣
Is it just me, or does anyone else need Anderson's glasses like ASAP 🔥🔥🔥
This is my ishhhhhh! Got it on REPEAT!! Bruno/.Paak BRAVOOOOOO👏
I literally knew that these two making a song together would be amazing no matter what! I was right this song is amazing!!! Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak together with their beautiful voices are immaculate✨
GLORIOUS
This song makes me want to leave the door open for my neighbor
Okay, so how is this the first time I'm seeing this?!?!? If bruno's last joint was 24K Magic, this right here is triple platinum magic! I'm a hip-hop artist but I grew up on this stuff right here--Motown, Jacksons, Smokey, Temps, ChiLites. These brothas are cold as ice! Top to bottom, from vocals to arrangement, to wardrobe--everything. And THANK YOU AP and Bruno for showing folks that brothas can shine together with no EGO!! I need COVID to hit the road REAL QUICK so me and wifey can see this LIVE!!! Bout to find me a silk sonic shirt somewhere 🤓😎
0:02 why does he kinda look like the weekend
Omg yes u did it this time ❤🤩
I love flats
Bruno Mars just needs to let me have his baby already ❤️
god damn this so classy!
They did that ❤️
🥰🥰🥰
this is what got me into bruno mars again, and  I am also a dead- flustered mess as well
So in LOVE with this song🥰
Reminds me of older black music! Full of swagger, talented singers, and music to remember for a lifetime. Most songs we still sing today -like Celebration and September- are approaching their 50th birthday this decade. I can see many of Bruno’s songs doing the same.
I’ve never seen I never seen the people like that even Bruno Mars Bruno Mars is s
Bruno is by far the well known household name but Anderson has been killin it for a good minute. These two powerhouses coming together is just unfair. And will somebody PLEASE pull some strings to get these two to do the SuperBowl and restore some kind of order??!!
bruno mars can do no wrong!!! love to see it
Real RB
The music just TOOK ME AWAAAAY 🔥💓😘💓
I’ve watched this performance fifty-leven times already. Love the 70s feel.
This performance left me vibin' and breathless at the same time! All that is left to say is "Whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo" 🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶
... I hope there's a bunch of older artists cheering this on.
Bruno serving MJ's Rock With You vibes!
Great song and fantastic musicianship!!
Damn. Shit. Fuck.❤️
I 💘  this song!
Bruno never fails! Love his style!❤️
Do you hear the smooth sounds of Marvin Gaye 🎧🎼🎤 and old school Soul Train 🚂 So Retro! I could listen to this song a million times, just 999 more replays to go😂 There’s gonna be a lot of Christmas Babies  from this song 🎧 😱🙊👶🏾👶🏼👶🏿👶🏽😂😂😂
This song is Everything!!! I play it every day, :)
Didn't know that Dave Chappelle and T.I. collab on a song
Got that  70's vibe. Back when music was real!
Oh my goodness. Absolutely love everything about it
The woo woody woo woody woo wooo ar the end. Put the icing on the cake.
I can't remember a song that makes me smile as much as this song! The sound takes me back to my youth. Sigh . . . . xoxoxoxoxo
Outrageous 💞💕
I want to see Bruno live so badly, he's a born performer!
This is the "ish"
Everyone talking about Bruno but Anderson DELIVERED
I 💕 this song. this will become a classic.
I love BTS, but when Bruno Mars shows and shows out, I go back my first love Bruno Mars... Bruno Mars is Smooth, cool, and originality Bruno Mars is on another level.
Love how Bruno let someone else shine. That’s a true star ⭐️ and Shows humility and compassion for others. Not to many like him. Loved you the first time I saw you back 10 years. I said to myself “Self”, he’s gonna be a star ⭐️ Keep on rocking it out Bruno 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
Bruno Mars with his hand in his pocket is killing me.  #fangirl
you know what!!!!!🤐🤐🤐💯💯 Speechless......
“‘My hooouse clean, my poooool warm...!” I melted 😭
This is the real video in my opinion.
This song, performance is crazy good!  Bruno Mars showing off his versatility!
Oh thank God for real music. 🙏
And he had to beg to perform, when they were the best performance
I didn’t know Bruno’s Mars could get any finer. A beautiful king.
Okay Bruno Mars with your sexy self!  Grown and SEXY!
This is the music WE WANT
Genius 😍
AMAZING PERFORMANCE , ORIGINAL AND SEXY VOICES <3
This is my favorite thing on the internet right now....

Someone explain why I just bought bell bottoms and got a perm... Oh wait Bruno and Anderson...understood. Lovely performance.
one of the greatest hits from the 70s
It’s the first verse for me...too smooth ✨🥰
That song is so awesome I love this song we need more artists like them

This is WHAT I PREFER FOR MY SON TO GROW UP TO, THANK YOU 🙏🏾. So much swag and energy. I be “hitting “ those notes too 😂💞🌹
That is one of the most wonderful songs ever.  Bruno Mars has hit Diety level with his vocals.
How did more than 1,000 people vote against this incredible performance? This was wonderful in every way.
This song makes me feel like I should be tryna holla at a woman named Martha 😭 shit is smooth as butta
I know Bruno is the ish but y'all gotta show Anderson Paak some love. He is an underrated artist. I love his music!! Especially, his song called silicone valley and others. But Anderson did his thang on this song.🔥🔥🔥🔥💪🏾💪🏾
I love this Jam!! My Favorite💜

My jam
Love love 💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
I love that it has that 70’s-early 80’s vibe/motif.
Love how old school this song sounds ❤😎
Anderson’s verse in this version is so much more dynamic, this should be the official version
I love this..... I know tge 70s theme is only an affectation but I still appreciate it
🤰
This is crazy I seen this on tv but how clean was that at 3:20
They are both talented but seriously underrated
this performance was absolutely flawless. the melody choices. the voices, charisma of it all was simply magnificent. and I love that Bruno brings back old school r&b styled music
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I can't believe how good this is Wow!!!
1:53 SHA MON
I just noticed something today, the radio does not do this song justice.  Also, I love me some Anderson Paak, BUT, Bruno is still so damn sexy to me, even when he is not singing😘
Fucking Perfection! This is Music!
Watched this Video 5 times today ✊👍💯💯
I don't know if this is a stretch but this performance kinda gives you that lingering soul-touched feeling like a Prince performance used to give.. Not Exactly but something like it. I miss music coming from the soul
The most anticipated album of 2021
This is my Song yes!
That is a beautiful song well thought.  You sat and organize this song well.  The group remind me of Smokey and the Miracles.  Great.
Fortnite brought me here lol nice song 🎵 👌
La, la. La lalala 💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽
They are not human !! This is amazing and on another level
The ambitious desert monthly rush because ocelot cellularly provide with a lean interest. hypnotic, unbecoming diving
This is So old school r&b, the Delfonics, the Spinners, the Stylistics and the Temptations are sweating bullets! Thanks for bringing that smoooooooth sound back, fellas! Love it!
Love it
I need those shades....
Keep practicing! You may get there ...
Here April 5 2021 the Classic look  and Harmony is great Anderson just made this song Awesome. Had this song on replay and shared it with my friends.it as become one of my favorites  .. Listening to this song while   Wearing a mask in 2021  as definitely made me think 💭 it’s not so bad ..
He looks like Bobby de barge he even dances like him and his band just like switch
This video just saved my entire marriage. Yeah. 🤣❤️🥰 (but really though) TANK YA BRUNO!!
I've been reading all the comments about Brunos and Anderson's vocal abilities but let's not ignore the impeccable choreography. The two gentlemen in the back add an extra dimension to the entire performance. Especially the one in the back on the left, lol. He hit every step so hard and don't miss a beat. Just watch him. Smooth
Bruno Could definitely play as Bobby Debarge in a movie. He has the look and voice
LOVED! This performance. WHO! Says they don't make music like they use to? Lol. This song kinda reminds me of Backstreets Never Going To Let You Go from their Another Level Album
Love this man. My house clean.
EXTRAORDINARY!!!!
Smooth!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
yasssssssssssssssssssssssssss
Bruno out did himself! Got that whisper touch added !
HOT DAMN!!!
Loving this song ., thanks Anderson and Burno 🔥🔥💜💜
IF THEY DONT RELEASE THE ALBUM IN THE NEXT WEEK IM GOING TO RIOT
The amount of cocaine in this video. I love it 😂
This generations Gamble and Huff
I done watched this bout fiftyleven times.
Truly BEAUTIFUL!  Reminds me of the love songs from the 80's. Exquisite harmonies...Writing songs about romance...
Great performance!!!  Sooooo 70s!
I am OBSESSED!! This is such a genuine, good hearted song
So refreshing!!! But all Bruno gotta do is leave that door cracked... Kicking and breaking it down! 💃🏽🚪 😘
REAL SINGERS NO LIP SYNCING!!!! 💪🏽
I love love this song! I mainly listen to songs from the 70s-90s which is why I love it! and I'm in my late 20s lol Can't stand some of the millennial songs.
I'm coming thru...Leave the door open!!!!
Max woulda been on this....
🥰🥰🥰🎶🎵
I haven’t wanted to play a song on repeat 🔂 in a very long time. I hate for the song to end it’s so good.
I hope Bruno and Anderson make music together for years to come. Absolutely magical duo. Can't stop listening.
The vocal 👏 control 👏
I love it
I love this soooo much♥️♥️. This is especially sexy!!!
Hot..... Sexy..... Soooo Smoothe.....
Can we just take a moment to appreciate how this is just like those 1970s songs
I’m just so taken by Bruno’s vocals....like... 😳😳
I’m so ready to hear a choir sing this 😍
I love both the studio version and the Grammys. My opinion there’s no difference.They brought it on home on both.
Where have I heard this beautiful voice (Anderson) coming from someone else (voice over?). It's just too familiar, singing other hit records, not under this name tho,,, just listen 👂, and I've never heard his name before now.... 🤔🤔.
They stole this from fortnite
Fortnite kids: this is from Fortnite
old school flavor.
i need more of Bruno's voice in this song
i like the part when they say imma leave the door open
King von punching the clouds bc of the title rn
I luv I luv I luv you guys!!!!
Beautiful❤️
It’s the guy from fortnite
The king is BACK! performance was spectacular.
that BRUNO....LAWD so fine!
Love this sooo MUCH!...So glad to hear people who can sing sang AGAIN...Please give us MORE!
One of the best live performances I've seen in a while.
well done guys, bringing back that old vibe but with a new flair.
So glad they brought back that 70s talent, style, feel and font. 💓💯
Leave the door open honey😊
Oh my goodness.  Why you gotta be so good?  Oh my goodness.
THIS IS MY JAMMY JAM! BRINGING THAT OLD SCHOOL SOUL SOUND BACK!!!!
😍💋
This song made me look at my husband romantically again lol ... He's about to get it if I listen to it again  ... He better thank Bruno and Anderson 🤣🤣🤣
Ok but I want jungkook to jump on this track with this concept-
Yes another good song he made.
fire......yagaaaaaaa
2:20 Mmmmm
Omg this was hot ❤️❤️❤️❤️
So much swagger ❤️🔥🔥🔥
Damn, I need a Polyester suit ASAP!
I love Bruno Mars music, I love the oldish feel!
your Dance is on fortnite now
Performance of the century.  Pure class.
3pc suits from the ‘70s can save this country.
Shut ur trap🤣 loving this song!💞
I’m starting a petition to make this the official version of this song.
No need to wait patiently for, or skip to your favorite part...This whole damn song is 'EAR-CANDY'!...♡
Ohhhhhh wow Super Nice.!!
The official video caught my attention. They all looked like they were genuinely having fun. But this. This! Fuck man, these guys are incredibly talented and want them to do more together.
So smooth 😎👌
I could not stop listening like over and over
Their clothes are giving me O'jay vibes
I wonder how many ladies run to his door right when they hear this song 😂
filipino...asian pride
Can we appreciate how Bruno is not trying to  outshine the rest of the members even though he's the bigger artist?
I find it very annoying how bruno makes 1 song once in a while
For anyone who doesn't know this live version  with Bootsy Collins introducing them is available for download now on all platforms
I've already lost count of how many Grammys this will win next year!
and thats what you call talent
The majestic taste thessaly snow because cheese chiefly radiate atop a mushy promotion. axiomatic, demonic hippopotamus
When modern meets classic = LEGENDARY 💎
You have gotten old school attention.Thank you continued success.Closed your eyes and listen you will think its the 1980s.
When he raised his arm and said “If you’re hungry girl I got fillets” I felt it.  Now I’m starving for it😛😍😍😍.
Ok then great remind me back in the day (love it)
I love Good feel music. And a great performance that keeps me coming back here. 😍
I been under a rock, but crawled from under it when I heard this ..👌🏿
Starting to wonder if this was actually live vocals and not a track. At 1:16 it looks like Bruno stops but the vocal keeps going. I don't know anything about live singing, just wondering if anyone else caught that.
This song is absolutely terrific, I could only wish music on the radio sounded more like this! Bruno Mars gets it done every time!!!!
bruno you look good and can sing so fine i love this song infact i love all of your music in fact i just bought 5 of your cds
Who came to see if he was going to do the emote
Like the old saying says Nobody does it better Bruno  & Paak took a tried and true formula and breathed New Life into this more than lackluster music industry with it's cookie cutter, soulless auto tune miscarriage of perceived talent it's laughable I grew up with the kind of MUSIC! Bruno's been putting out whether it's his take on Funk or now this glorious homage to old school R&B these guys deserve every accolade in the book and then some heck that song could possibly soothe a savage beast!
Came here from fortnite , No way you made the full cover of the fortnite song. didn't get better than in fortnite, but look what you did.
Can we give just give major props to the wardrobe stylist, set and lighting designers. Those suits tho, the color of lenses in their glasses, the fabric texture-color-n-flow down to the wide flared paints. The visuals combined with da MUSIC: puuuuuuuuurfection.
This was a good fortnite dance👍
Bruno man.. so inspirational..
This is my song for my hubby a truck driver
#BRUNOMARS!😍
There is no surpassing this master art.
This has been declared the best live performance of all time.
I can not Express how much I love this old school feel. THIS is what I've been waiting for! Keep'em coming! Greatness right here, u can feel! This is a whole vibe and I'm here for ALL of it!!!
Refreshing to hear the old stye of music once again! True Talent!! I got vibes of The Temptations and Jackson 5. Love it! ❤️
Yeah now this sounds like good music :> gives that 70’s vibes to me.
3:21 THIS NOTE CHANGE HITS DIFFERENT
You guys did it right! Looking forward to seeing what you do next.
Got that 70s style. Nice song!
Finally, some good music!!😀🔥
LEGENDARY SHIT!!!!!
OK, I'm gettin' nostalgic throwback hints of The Enchantments/The Manhattans/The Stylistics/The Main Ingredient & The Whispers!!!(...I Like & Very Impressed!!! 😊)
This is so beautiful ! 🥰🥰🥰
My god, Bruno Mars is too amazing.
This feels like a Soul Train flashback. I keep expecting to see Don Cornelius doing the interview afterwards. Great stuff.
Maybe good music is coming back? They remind me of the coolness and smoothness of the Temptations.
Bruno Mars was the worlds youngest Elvis impersonator when he was just four years old. In 1990 he got featured when he was 13 live and made a spectacular performance. Fast forward to 2021 and this man is still making amazing music
Thank you for pronouncing "Paak" correctly
Damn!
I love you Bruno & Anderson❤️❤️❤️👍👍👍
Woooooooooooooo FELT THAY CHAMP
Love this song
I love it have that 70s and 80s vibe

Wait , that’s the dance from fortnite !!!
Buenos parent are proud of him
❤️‍🔥
Who’s here from fortnite 😂
Bruno Mars is one of the few artists who can make the live version sound BETTER than the studio version.
I'm crying cause my dad loved bruno Mars and would have loved the imagery of this video, the sound and of course vocals!!!! He was an older kid/young teen  in the 70s .. I'm sad he never got to experience this time period of bruno Mars doing the 70s thing because he loved all his other songs!!! He died a year ago on March 22, 2020 and his 55th bday would have been soon on April 9th but his bad heart finally took his life ):
Yooo this performance was flawless 💗💗💗💗💗💗
Life was good when Bruno was making hits..... Anderson killed it. Underrated.
Am I the only perve that noticed Bruno's.... 🤐
Anderson and Bruno Mars good together the whole team look good
The dynamic duo. How dare they form this crazy ass alliance. Genius
Yong men doing Grown music it appreciate it. Thank You Anderson and Bruno.
They sound like Switch almost
Best live performance I’ve seen in a long time. From the stage presence, delivery, and the vocal range. I can watch this 1000x ❤️🙏🏽
🔥🔥🔥
El Debarge gotta be somewhere smiling!! Thats who I see n hear when Bruno be puttin it down!! If El can still do it at his age,...I'd like to see him n Bruno do a classic sound duet like this. Be str8 FIYYAAH!!!!  Heard it 1st here!!

I love the old school vibes, my grandmother is from Hawaii love the local boy Bruno.
1.6k didn’t like the song... get your silly young a$$3s out of here. This grown folk music 💪🏽💯
The choreography, lighting, two-shots, the rack focuses, the background visuals, on top of the most fire vocals and song. Just spectacular #CLAPITUP

Hell yeah!!!!!!!
#BlueLightsInTheBasementHouseParty
This performance is top tier and lives rent free in my head. I’m ready for the album and tour. It gives me The Manhattans. The Temprees, Smokie Robinson and The Miracles. They captured REAL music and their voices sound AMAZING together
And if you're hungry, girl I got the Lays.
My neighbor: Would you like a Jets deep dish pizza Me: 3:03

Don't get me wrong I love the music from Bruno Mars but this song is pretty good but his perm in that little mustache does not fit him I don't think he's black but it seems that that's what he looks like it's not him

This is so classic.
Yaaaaassss!!!
People don't see it but Bruno is the closest to Michael Jackson vocally. Dude makes you feel the music.
This type of music brings back magical memories of when groups like The stylistics, the Enchantments, The Ebony’s... The Dramatics, The Delphonics and Manhattans were the best!
Silk Sonic you'll rocked this one, my 21 tub relaxation piece on repeat
These performances in this Duo's legendary.
The standing seaplane prenatally soak because energy anatomically rhyme out a needless horn. cagey, serious industry
True talent.  He can switch it up and still sound great!  No auto tune needed here!
I’m getting real New Edition vibes. Bring back amazing music
Yasssssss
Keep doing what you do Bruno
This is a true throwback to the great ballards of the early 70s! The stylistics, Harold Melvin and the blue notes all of those guys!
New super group. In a retro kind of way paying homage to the r&b greats.  Well done.
Bruno my baybeeee
Jesus the way Bruno can sing so effortlessly and sound just like he does in the studio version is why I believe God has favorites
LALALAAAAAAAA LALALALAAA
This sing is too fly..I love it.  Bruno kills all old school vibes.  I feel like I'm listening to my moms music only cooler.
He makes me melt! This is so 🔥🥵😳🥰☺😍😍😍
Greatest duo ever!

IT GETS BETTER?!! YES! I could die happy that I’ve heard this song and seen this performance! Seriously....Always loved watching the Motown groups and their synchronized dance/ song routines since I was a little kid! This warms my heart! 🤙🏝
Are you f'ing kidding me??  This is FANTASTIC!!  Great song, TREMENDOUS vocals, wonderful arrangement & the dancing is perfect!  THIS is how R&B was in the 1970'S!   Sung with passion and look great doing it.  We're talking the Stylistics, the Floaters - you name it.  These Guys KILLED it - Great job.  Wow..  Just wow.
1970’s vibe 😎
Best album of the year I’m calling it now
This is a work of art and the song makes me smile! Haven’t loved a song in soooooo long!!! Addicted!!
😂😂😂😂 issa bop for sure
0:46 Anderson pulled that mic away toooo damn smooth when he was playing with the timing of the song good lord!
Love love yall sounds good 👍
3:10  👁🤰🍃... 👁🤰🍃
Now y’all see why Anderson made the 2017 XXL Freshmen List!
THAT MAN IS AN EXPLOSION OF TALENT!!!!! I LOVE ALL HIS WORK!!! UNBELIEVABLE!!
yall better stop criticizing and phukkin' wit Bruno Mars, the dude is dope AF. This is real Soul Music, he and Anderson.Paak ripped this track up!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
that stache gives me nervous vibes ... like a 70's porn movie director ... but you know what? I aint mad at it
This is incrediibblleee. I love this disco revival
i’ve listened and watched to this about 12384822 times and about 12384822 times to go
My man sung this song to me.  I was blushing. I was thinking he is really funny. Wow he is creative with music. All of the songs he was singing to me came out many years later. This was one of the songs. I had no idea it was a real song until the other day it came on the radio. What's sad is that I really like Bruno Mars as an artist so I should know. I guess it flew over my head. Bruno Mars never gets boring his skills just gets better and better.
Listen Anderson's Vocals along with Bruno's Swag & Mustache 😩🙌🏾👏🏾🔥 Let's not forget these smooth ass gentleman holding down the background vocals and choreo... THIS IS EVERYTHING 🗣️
From my afro puffs to my knickerbockers popping wrigleys double mint gum on a hot summer day. This cut puts me ALL in my back in the day feelings, lol 😂 did your thang here, well done fellas.💯
Love Love Love It💙💙💙
Old school vibe is in for 2021, let’s bring it back baby!!!
Wow this so amazing loving this 🎧 song 🎶 ❤️🎶🎶🎶🔥🔥🔥
Excellent!!!!
This was so smooth
Both have  such beautiful voices!  All of them together sound amazing!
Idk who Anderson is but I like him and Bruno together
My new ring tone
Dame.
Take me back yaw. Love the Melody.
It's the ending for me 🥺👏🏾😭
They went Ol’ School  Stylistics, Dramatics, Blue Magic ect...
I know why people are saying bad things they think its similar to treasure but its not at all even from 24k he was more upbeat then almost rapping
They can saaaaaang!!!!!!
BLUE MAGIC VIBES🔥🔥
I just play this over and over and over and over to the point where Alexa just keeps it on repeat.  I'm so hooked.  I hope Silk Sonic is working on more music.  :)  This is the bomb diggety.  Really takes me back.
absolutely genius. that’s all.
Wow. REAL MUSIC.
Just announced they're releasing a single of the LIVE version!❤
This gives me After Seven vibes so much. Totally love it!!
Love me some Anderson Paak!!! He can sing to me all day :-)
Love this song,,,,,,,,,,,,totally 1970's
i watch this video at least 5 times a day 😀
Genuinely makes me happy 😊 seeing this ... for 12th or 15th time lol
If this isn't proof that Bruno Mars still has his amazing singing voice, then I don't know what is.  "If only Bruno Mars could bring back his singing voice instead of doing all these rap tunes"  Bruno Mars - "Hold my pepsi"
Incredible harmonies! I'm hearing so much soul, jazz, and pop, it's like a Souljazzapop! Love this version. 😀
We’re all in the 70s on soul train!!
I just realized their lip singing some parts of it...
Bruno and Anderson 💟 Your Voices and Dance Moves 😎So Greatful Your Back BRUNO MARS 💟
the only legitimately entertaining segment of the grammys.......
Great choreography🔥🔥🔥
Love this song!!
Great music!  Love the retro coreography and suits!  Right on target!
I'm ready to make another baby dammmmmnnnnnnn Bruno
I luv luv luv them!!!!!
Officially In Love with this song and Bruno Mars! Anderson Paak as Silk Sonic!!!!!!💋💋❣️❣️❣️
Silk Sonic is my tonic
I am married woman...but I need to find this door. 🕵🏃💃
Keep listening 2 this. Yaaas BAE BAE leave the door OPEN. Sha mone💋
No disrespect to him, but I know Miguel somewhere like, "Nah, we ain't doing that"! I bet he comes out with a banger, too. 👍 I mean, this shit tough. We need more of this...  real type rhythm and blues
This is song that you have on your "get ready playlist" leading up to your "bedroom playlist." Amazing
Yes!!! 🔥👍🤜🤛🙏 Let's bring that old-school feel back. I write, dance, & sing that type style, too. Most love it. Yet, it's a couple say, "You too old-fashioned style for this era". What do they know?! Hey. IDK. I know this is the BEST song out this far. It gives that classic motown era with a twist of freshness. 👍🔥🙏
This was truly spectacular. Outstanding musicians you both are!
Who down voted this you need a good slapping.... This is even better than the official video track.
SOUL TRAIN VIBESSSS , IM 25 and LOOOOOVING IT ❤️
Yo that other dude sound great but, that Bruno Mars OMMFG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

A pinch of the 70s love it
Every time Bruno sings leave the door open...I just melt😍
Bruno Mars and Company proving they did their homework in studying the 1970s and they're successfully making themselves stand out in the current musical climate of "everybody looks and sounds the same"
The witty step-father ostensibly whirl because creditor ignificantly laugh a a bite-sized business. knotty, willing restaurant
DOPE 🔥🔥🔥👑👑👑👑👑👑
Old school harmony. Tell  me that you comin....thruoooooooooou woo ho woo hooooo. LOL. Love it.

Oh my goodness 😍
THE FIRST ONE TO LOVE ME % The first one to love me was You; Lord And nothing can take that away. My soul is refreshed by living water While my heart flows with love each day.  I thank You for the love of my family And I thank You for the love of my life. I thank You for all of the blessings You give to each husband and wife.  Your glory rides high on the sunsets Your voice is the thunder of rain. I thank You for all of the heavens And Jesus who came to be slain.  I feel when Your eyes are upon me As You listen to my humble cry. You've redeemed the soul of Your servant To dwell in Your mansion on high.  I’ll claim each and every promise  From the Lord of the Earth and sky. I'm so glad I’m free from my bondage Of the grave where my body shall lie.  I thank You for parting the darkness And guiding my footsteps each day. I thank You for being my Shepherd You've walked with me all the way.  THANK YOU FOR WHO YOU ARE IN YOUR HEART ! By Tom Zart Most Published Poet On The Web Tom’s 1,650 Poems Are Free To Share!
There just a raw element to Bruno’s voice that can’t be surpassed!!! This song right here is one of those songs you wanna listen to over and over and over again!! I can’t explain it.  You wanna become one with the music. Especially that bridge❤️❤️ what else can I say🤷🏽‍♀️

BRUNO.BABY. I BEG YOU WE NEED AN ALBUM
2020s Dramatics! I appreciate this modern version of THEE Legendary Dramatics.
LOVE BRUNO.....BUT, BIG MISTAKE parting w/ the hooligans, y'all HAD IT ALL😍 miss the brass & all your boys.  CAN U BACK IT UP W/ A REPLAY ??????
Man I hope music goes back to this
Much respect. My band actually WORE those outfits...in real time! I've been asked to keep sharing my copyrighted, pre-hip-hop, pre-rap, no autotune, old-school classic 70's ballad, "Don't Act Surprised". On Apple, Spotify, Pandora, Shazam, YouTube, (Napster - in Latino countries), Chordify (to learn the chords),....,download on Amazon for just 99 cents, and the recently released "Key To Our Love, Vol 1" limited-edition, European-released vinyl & digital album, on Google.  https://youtu.be/e6tsTYcftp0     By David Dawkins/ Charisma, of Newark,, NJ. I wrote it, sang lead, & played drums. It's a breakup song, but we got back together & had a beautiful baby girl 9 months later. dawk110@gmail.com. Peace!
One of the best slow jams in 2021 Bruno and Anderson rocked their performance now this is real music. 💯💯💯🙌🙌🙌
Ooh whee... that remains me of the oldies but goodies...Bruno Mars is super Duper fine!!!
This song gives me chills it’s the ultimate greatest! 🎼♥️
NO idea how someone could dislike this. Satan's people.
The best.  They song it very well
Good music is back.🙌🏼
That one hand 🖐 in the air is the new 2 step!!! No debates!!!
He finally came back😌
Beautifully done gentlemen. 👏👏
Refreshing! Music needs ti gk back to the 60s-90s roots of performing and not gimmick. Bravo silk sonic I'll buy that album with no hesitation.
Touched my soul magical
Refreshing 🥰🥰
Real Groovy! This takes me back to real singing!
Watch in 240p to get the full 70s effect
Magnificent mind blowing performance, what more can I say!
I love leave the door open it it’s the best song ever
I can’t tell you how many times I’ve watched and listened to this specific performance. 🥴 OBSESSED
The well-to-do responsibility posteriorly apologise because fertilizer socioeconomically manage astride a plain servant. decisive, wanting south korea
M rawdy toddler sat in my lap quite to listen to this. This is magic.
So 70s, love it... reminds me of the Floaters singing Float On!
He can sing anything and it will sound amazing.
This is the real deal.  I love this song.  Im a Bruno Mars true fan.  Great music 💝
I love this .... Reminds me of the old school group “Switch” 🤩
Nobody: Anderson: WOO HOO WOO HO HO HO  Me: GO DEMARCUS GO DEMARCUS
Wow!
This gives me 70s jackson 5 vibes
Sounds like  - ( 3t ) tease me .
I feel like Bruno Mars comes from an ancestral family of  musical descendants. I can see his Great Great Great Grandfather playing drums. ✨⭐️✨
May I ask what kind of filets?
Omg 😮 ... amazing !!!!  A great performance. I could replay over and over. Do they have an album ????? ❤️❤️❤️❣️❤️❤️❤️
THIS IS FUCK**G GOLD ✨
Pure musical geniuses at work here! Can't stop listening to this song. Well done!!!
Anderson paak can sing me to bed every night. My husband won’t mind. It’s just music and that’s my business.
Fuck that was beautiful
Better than the radio version Bruno hit platinum again💪🔥
Best mf performance ever  ongod
I love this is going to be my song I get married to
Everyone: today’s music all sounds the same, can’t listen to it.  Silk Sonic: I gotchu fam....
😍🥰
Magical✨
I hope this performance can show the rest of my generation just how good a live performance can be. The studio recording of this track is great by itself, but I think the more soulful nature of this live performance would persuade nine out of ten people into choosing this sort of live sound over the studio song. I just really love the art of live music performance and wish others could be exposed to that sort of sound more than they are these days. So, imagine if the studio version of this song had been recorded like an old Motown record instead of like a modern, spotless hip hop/pop song. It would be about a million times better than it already is, IMO. These guys are so damn talented that it is an absolute SHAME (and even insulting to them) that their tracks get processed and auto-tuned/gridded to death in the studio. I mean, give me the real human emotion of a live performance like this over a robotic, computer studio-perfect track any day of the week.   I just feel like so many other 20-somethings like me don't even realize what they're missing when it comes to the slight imperfections in music that make it feel more human. Virtually everyone agrees that this version of the song is better than the studio version, so what can we do to make other people realize that this is the sort of thing we want? We gotta demand that real, sometimes imperfect artistry and emotion in studio songs becomes OK again. It is time for the imperfect sound of prime era soul records to make a comeback in this soulless world of ours. Let this be an example of how things could be in the realm of popular music. Studio perfect music with every note perfectly in tune and every beat right on the grid DOES NOT equal better music. All that does is kill the soul of a song. Please bring some humanity back into popular music and make music "imperfect" again!!!
So anyone else getting temptations mixed with 5 heartbeats vibe.. love it can't wait to hear more.
Anderson .Paak is rocking those shiny heart sunglasses ❤👄❤
Love it, a 70's vibe.
They did that! aww memories of when he used to tell me, Imma leave the door 🚪 open
This song gives me some Stevie Wonder vibes
Another classic
All from a little Punk Rock Kid from Oxnard Oxnard, stand up!
A fine job with talent
WHY ISNT ANYONE TALKING ABOUT ANDERSON'S VOICE
Off the chain (from this 59 yr old woman). Perfect
YALL BETTER SAAAANG DAMN IT!!!!!
holy shit. what a performance
Luvs OMG 💜❤🥰
Finally adult music.. For the 30’s older crowd
Silk Sonic better come thru!!!!!
Bruno Mars and Trever Noah look so much alike, they could be related!😱
Damn, Anderson can actually sing.  Great song... beautiful melodies.
Bruno Mars is the only artist I wouldn’t mind paying $1000+ ticket to see live!
This is such a beautiful song. Definitely a classic.
Smooth, jazzy and sexy💃💃💃

This was everything!
Maaaaaaaaannnn!❤️
Those were the times when music sounded like this.  It could get no better.
To me the best part of this song is the climax at 3:03. Bruno put  his heart into it.
Please this version to album, y'all killed it.
This is vibe I grew up with....
60s temptations vibe...meets 21st century...nice crooning, sanging and swaying
If this was the temptations  Anderson's paak : david ruffin😂 Bruno mars : otis😂  The best video and performance hands down💯💯💯💯 this song is so dope💪🏾
Nothing gets better than this.  This is music at its finest.  I hope and pray that the Silk Sonic collaboration is not a "one and done" deal.
Needed
The visual accompanies the song so well... Issa whole vibe at this point!
This song makes me feel like 2021 is gonna be a great year lol thanks Pak & Bruno. This song is fuckin iconic. The vibe is lit 🔥
Definitely got that Jackson 5 vibe.... True Talent!!! ❤️
Pure Music Magic! Absolutely Beautiful ❤️
I love how this seems like it was made in the 70's 🤩
It wasthe stars
Grown People ONLY music!
Omg... This is amazing
This what U call REAL music!
The wrong piccolo neurophysiologically rescue because taurus cytogenetically surround above a slow aluminum. robust, hissing dinghy
Oldies vibes

Gotdamn I’ve never been more proud to be the same race as my mans Bruno Mars

Yes real music and performance.
I need this on Spotify or apple music or somewhere we're I can put this on repeat and download
HES DROPPING THE LIVE VERSION FRIDAY
This Was A Amazing  Performance Especially Vocally and They Was Doing The Woo Walk 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾🔥🔥🔥
It could not be better, Thank you Bruno Mars and Anderson, this song is beyond amazing, since the Gramys this song is been played in so many places in the world.  You both will make history. The whole band, the video is great.  Bruno Mars Amazing voice.
He is the epitome of swag!!
Hot Damn !!
I love this song it beautiful
Also these guys are fucking platinum!!!! Drop the album!!!! Please!!!
Okay hear me out Watch this in 360p or 480p!!!  It literally feels like an old school performance!!!
Wow do I love this.
My my my. Wet all over. Lol
Chloe Bailey ( of chloe and Halle) brought me here
This right here is smoother than silk!
This is the Bruno that I mostly like and Anderson a big fan also, great job Fellas
Moments of genuine harmonic surprise:  0:20 this chord is a G/F which is functioning as a spicy version of a G7 (the V chord)  0:55 an abrupt and fantastic modulation up a minor 3rd to the key of Eb  1:04 this Gsus7 (F/G) to get back to our original key of C   1:08 the delayed resolution of landing on the tonic  1:28 when we finally land on the tonic for the first time in the song it's just absolutely explosive and feels amazing to hear  1:31 this resolution is followed by a chord that is easily the spiciest, jazziest and most heartwrenching chord I've ever heard in any song by a mainstream musical artist. An A7(b9, b13). I'm just in love with silk sonic now.  2:00 back to the B section in Eb  2:10 this Gsus7 somehow manages to hit harder the second time around  2:36 this chord again. holy fuck I love it.  2:39 here we continue the progression by changing keys again to Eb  2:43 we get this Gsus7 again implying a short key change back to C  2:39-2:52 we get this two-chord vamp that jumps from Eb to C by means of the chords Abmaj9 and Gsus7. the Abmaj9 can also be thought of as the b6 in the key of C.  2:52 this two-chord vamp jumps down a whole-step so that we can modulate up a half-step to Db 2:59 we modulate by means of a ii7-Vsus7  3:04 rather than completing the ii7-Vsus7 by resolving to a Imaj7, we delay the resolution by going back to our progression from the verses (IVmaj7, V7, iii7, vi7)   3:38-4:16 here we get this amazing chord progression. Dbmaj7, Bb7(b9,b13), Amaj9, Absus7. This chord progression is absolutely sublime and makes me feel all the feelings.  This analysis doesn't serve this song enough justice because I'm absolutely speechless. As a jazz musician, I never expect anything of this caliber of music theory or musical complexity. I'm so excited to see where this duo goes next. Hopefully, this will bring back musical complex to popular music. Thanks for reading. I'm gonna go now. Bye.
Love it
Yeah, they killed that.
Yes ! Y'all,  I dare you, do it again lol
Dope
So next Grammys I can see them getting best pop and r&b  performance
How can you NOT like this song?  It's so refreshing, mellow, smooth, and just a great grown folks song!
Welp...... this is legit the first time I'm heard this song and it is fantastic!
Why does the guy look like the weekend
Straight 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Grown folk music ... bring it back good music ✊🏿❤️❤️🔥  🎶
Absolutely LOVE this song. I love the classic sound, the music, the lyric, the entire vibe. My favorite part is 3:01-3:24. This collaboration is genius and I am patiently waiting on the entire album to drop.
Bruh that’s one of the most fire shits I’ve ever heard
So...I’ve just watched this again for the 50th time (that’s probably accurate😆😆). How was the crowd not cheering and at least one person throwing a shoe? 🤔🤷🏽‍♀️
In my 28 years of life this is the best song I've ever heard, by someone who isn't 70 years old
Bruno Mars is the finest man in my opinion. The SWAG that man holds is phenomenal FRRRR
Literally, the only reason I watched the Grammy's this year🙌🏽 Should've been The Weeknd's year.
I come here once or thrice a day.
Love this....magic..Bruno's voice is just raspy gold...
Bruno, that's  the best song so far !
OMG!!!! We need good music. Give credit where credit is due. Love it!!!
This was amazing, song on repeat 😏💓
1970s is back baby
The impossible fridge bizarrely strengthen because congo preferentially name absent a glistening glorious gym. hurt, fluttering polo
“Hey look Trevor Noah”  *Skips ahead
Sexy and smooth!!
I love how tik tok videos did this song good
Such a great song, U got my vote.
“My hooouse clean, my pooool warm.” YES ANDERSON!!! The rasp! I love it. I would love to hear them with the Hamiltones in the background.
Sing  it Bruno, you know how to do it
Totally in 💘
My jaw dropped wow ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
The cagey cuticle pathohistologically protect because dirt problematically scold absent a broken slime. four frail, jagged tree
I will drink Bruno Mars bath water . Thats all I had to say
song of the year 2021...amazing collaboration.
Yo! Anyone who ain’t feelin this joint can’t call themselves a fan of music or should stop listening to music period! Both these kats have been making the most original funkiest soulful and most creative sounds in the last decade!💯 This here has been a long time coming, real music is back ya’ll!!!
This song is like pure genius!! It's got that old school vibe just smooth these folks gave us a pure hit. So much talent here!!
When Anderson said “ my house clean “  😱

Bruno Mars is who musical legends aspire to be, when they grow up.
Love this jam

Wooooo, leave it wide open and bring back that good good music.  YAAASSSSS!!!! #michealjacksonvibe #oldschool
both sound so good
Way too good. Both of them are underrated in my opinion. And together they are incredible.
I can watch 0:53-0:58 for a thousand times over.  This brings back the 60's moment.
Bruno Mars vs Miguel???
Am I wrong?  Bruno looks a little like Sammy Davis Jr. in this video?
😍🙌🙌🙌😍
I like the 1970s soul group sound.
That ending was just perfect. That “whoo-wha-wha- whoo- wha-wha- whoo woooo” just hit the spot
This is officially my favorite song and performance  this year!
🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 man i love this🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
SILK SONIC should be the "SUPERBOWL HALFTIME SHOW" forever!
This song is like CRACK  i cant stop listening!   Thank you BRUNO AND ANDERSON etl. The world needed this!!!!
...and just when the world needed them the most they returned to save Music. Salute to Bruno Mars and Anderson Paak. Two artists whose whole catalogues are timeless music. I don’t give that compliment to anyone who hasn’t earned it with good lyricism, original music, and true talent. Both are brilliant MUSICIANS, can SING, PRODUCE, and take you on a journey through their songwriting.
Oh my gosh my crush at work just sent this to me 🤭 Never heard this song before but it is now my favorite 🤩
Love Bruno Mars!
Of course people not giving Pak the props he deserves for making this song hot as well. Its all about bruno the vulture
3:41 Bruno hit em with the Michael Jackson "chummo"
ok this shit is masterful and they need to be locked for preforming flawlessly.
If I was there I would have jump out of my seat and been dancing with my lady straight up  and we would have killed it
Got damnnn it this shit is FIREEEEEEEE
That's that ol' Stylistic, Delfonic, Confuction, Brass Construction, Cameo, Smokey Robison and some Miracles Shit...
The 1.5k who disliked deserves to jump off a bridge who’s with me?
Bruno never misses
AY YO YALL HERE WHEN BRUNO WENT 𝓵𝓪𝓵𝓪𝓵𝓪
This was filled with swagger, and is such an Incredible performance. 😎😊
Perfect performance
Now that's some talent right there.  These up and coming artists could learn a thing or two from these FINE A$$ gentlemen.
When Anderson .Paak says "hungry" and "fillets" 😍💘💝💔💕💞💓💗💖❤😂
This is taking me back. This song will be on repeat. I was wondering where you were BRUNO you guys are great singers and performers. Thank you for keeping R&B alive.🥰🥰
Sound an feel like music in the 70s. Romantic so so good 😍
I love this song it reminds me so much of my Fiancé who passed away last year. It’s brings a smile and tears ❤️❤️❤️❤️
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS BRUNO BABY !!!
This beats the studio version , they should have gone with this for the video. This song is beautiful ,but 3:24 & on is my favorite part.

This Grown Folks music !!!🔥 🔥 🔥

Aaaaaaaaaaawwwe shit I'm getting pregnant this year 😂💋💋💋💋
bro Bruno is like stuck in the golden era of music
For those of you who never experienced the late 70s and 80s, I feel sorry for you.
Glad Anderson Paak is getting the credit he deserves. Hope this isnt the last of silk sonic
Bruno and Paak’s album better have a song with Khalid in it

Bruno is too smooth with the moves . In all honesty this live version made me like the song .
I want this outfit 😍😍😍 cinch in the waist a little and flare out the bottom of the pants and boom you got a 70s power suit 🙈🙈
1:57 👌
this is so hot wow
Talk about 1000 percent commitment to their performance. wow.
The choreopgraphy is insane, Anderson and his backup singer make a gester to leave a door open , then they pray when the word hope comes up .......wow.
Magic
I have fallen in love with Bruno Mars

"True Talent"  ❤️

Marvin Gaye & The Temptations called:  "The 70's need their fits & beats back!" 🤣

I gave up on music years ago. Especially watching the Grammy s. But Im reborn. True love music still exist. 💑
JESUS CHRIST is returning to take His children away from this evil world. Seek Him and repent for your sins. He is the Way the Truth and the Life. No one on earth is a good person. It is only through JESUS, that you are forgiven and made right in GOD'S eyes🙏

I need more of this music!!!! MOOOORE!!!!
Anderson betta SANG!
One of best songs of the year
Perfection!
These fine brothers🔥🔥🔥
He is a god
The 70's aesthetic is dripping ...
Reminds me of the Delfonics or the Dramatics 🎶💕💕💕💕
Proof that Bruno Mars does not need autotune and doesn't use it in his songs
The 1.7 k people that disliked this performance are haters.
Awww those are the glasses Anderson’s son wore to the 2020 Grammys ❤️❤️
This deserved an instant Grammy. Absolutely beautiful.
Now why wasn’t this Half time super bowl? Just saying.
The temptations and Barry Gordy would be proud! 🏆
While the weeknd and other artist was boycotting the grammys.. silk sonic was begging the grammys to perform.
Yessss this is the song.
I can’t get over Andrews voice
I couldn't tell them apart on the original album.  Jeezz...their voices are complimentary and very similar.
Anderson Paak can sing tho
High level music 🎶 people. Appreciate this.
OMGEEEEEEEEE! Bruno is an ABSOLUTE problem! Oooo-weeeeeeeeeee
Hot damn!!!
I never wanted to see anybody bin concert has bad as I want to see these guys!
Outstanding is an understatement , beyond cool!!
Oh my gosh I can't decide whether I like the live performance more then the studio version 😩💞
The woo woo woo woo at the end.... Somebody got pregnant at that very moment
This is what I've been looking for in my R&B for 2021
What can I say? Looks FAB, Sounds FAB, Bruno & Anderson  BRAVO, BRAVO, BRAVO, I knew "this sound" would be back and YOU brought it.  Peace
Awesome!! Love it !! They dont make music like this anymore old school feel definitely.. its ah hit !!
Love it love it love it
I feel like frank ocean should be with them on this.
Brilliant.....my new favorite 🤩
Listened a million times already
Outstanding
Whoever disliked this needs a good ol fashion ass whoopin with grade A leather belt from James Evans himself. Straight up.
Bruno and Anderson 💟 Music and Performance Got everyone in a better place ☺️ During this Pandamic.
They have kilt the game!  Game over!!
AMAZING!😍
Never been so in love with a live performance 😍😍😍
Two words..Super Classic!!!
When your audience prefers the live version over studio, you've won
magical
Bruno NEVER disappoints, add Andy..💯💯🔥🔥🔥
2:17
This was Nice Oh! So Nice. Smooth like drinking your favorite Smoothie 💯👍. Bruno sounding good 👍💯 The Group : Oh! My My 💜💜🏆🥰 Took me back to the days of the Soulful R&B groups like The Temptations, Four Tops, The Dells, etc. The Smooth Cool Steps. Y'all better sing that song ✊😂😂💯👍 Listen to it 4 times. I pretended I was in the Group : Bam! Feel Right in on the Steps. The Heavenly Father did not give me the Gift to Sing 😂😂🤣🤣🤣 but I can still Dance at my age. Always Won Dance Contests back in the day. All Praises to YAH. Great Job Bruno Mars and Silk Sonic. Love the song
Bruno Mars and Anderson all so hella underrated. Tell if I'm wrong. I dare you.
I didn’t know Dave Chappel could sing!!! 🤭🤣🤭
Sexy smooth Marvin Gaye vibe 🤍
Man, that old school vibe with new school talent, loved it!
Bruno Mars the biggest pimp in America for the last 5 years
Wow😯😯😯😯😯😯😯😯😲😲😲😲
Wonderful melody
Great performance! Ilove Bruno Mars!
This sounds better than the studio version, please make this available on Apple Music this version !!!
Love it!!!! Absolutely amazing!!!! This was spectacular ✨✨✨✨✨
I loved everything about this duo and track , Refreshing!
Anderson Paak and Bruno Mars has that Eddie Cane swag. 😆
I was playing this song in my car. My mother asking me What do u know about the Chi-Lites? Lmao Silk Sonic bringing that 1970's vibe.
NOBODY:  ABSOLUTELY NOBODY:   ME: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Fabulous
sexy and romantic, com'on Bruno it's time to establish a new album! Can't wait more
People disliking this song should go and take the test for covid cause one of the symptoms of it is having no TASTE at all
My #1 favorite song!!! Love Bruno Mars!!
Yes thank you! Finally no autotune
Smoother than a baby!! My new favorite song that I would sing all day ❤️
BEDAZZLED SPEECHLESS ❤️🌹
Love it.. love it to death....my ears appreciate you both..thank you for your creativity.
This reminds of Bruno’s “Treasure” mv
❤️❤️❤️
My bluetooth speaker turned to cassette player right after listening to this song
This was wild 🔥
Taking it old school ✨❤️
Silk Sonic should have received a Grammy for this before the song was even released
It’s so nice to hear some love in the music. So tired of the hard core. Love this; I feel a slow dance / grind coming where’s my baby
This performance was so damn good! Whew🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
This was an amazing performance 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
James corden: SHUT THE FRONT DOOR Bruno: I'ma leave the door open
I fell in love. Omg. 🥰
I love this song, reminds me of the songs in the 70's.
1:23 every time that vocal reminds me of when I was you man because of the slight raspyness at the end
I feel like this is really good for Bruno Mars. Being in a band, I mean. There’s obviously a reason as to why he had been gone for so long and I feel like being in a band and maybe being a backup singer is a refresher from doing a lot of singles. Will love his music either way
For sure silk am I right?
Bruno sounds just like the studio version maybe even better wow 😳👏
I'm getting Kool and The Gang and Earth, Wind & Fire vibes with a hint of Stevie Wonder, Lionel Richie, Prince, Michael Jackson and the Bee Gees. In short, the 1970s decade.
This is music!!!! Yessss!!!
OK... I know it's filets, but can I get a pass to keep saying "Lays"?
Damn they fine
This is Gold,,,Reminds me of my teen years in NJ,,,,and The Music then,,,,
Now THIS is music!!!🤩😘
This. Is. Music! <3
Thank you saving the industry. I don't know what's going on with it.
Paak the new 🐐
Better than the track 🔥🔥
Bruno Mars is one of the very few artists creating beautiful black music at a time when many (not all) black artists are creating ugly embarrassing projects that won't last the test of time. Sorry for being blunt but the truth can sound ugly sometimes. We need 40 more projects like this to make the music world right again.
I'm seeing him live. I don't care how much tickets will cost. I need to see him!!
I just love Bruno Mars
My GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOODDDD!!!!!!!!!
I'm so glad he made a new song cuz God knows I'm tired of seeing asses and elbows 🤪
OMG He's the best IN LOVE ALL OVER AGAIN
LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS....
Remind of the early 90s
Imagine being alive in a time when music like this was all what topped the charts
if i watch this one more time 😥😭😭😂😂😂
Awesome Song. Thank You...
😍😍😍
Cool song with an old school vibe. I'm for it
Love the hair as well
The world needs love songs like this!!!
This was once of the best collaborations of our time🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽

Chills
Nobody can capture the essence of those times better than Bruno Mars.
Out of pure disbelief, I'd love to hear logical explanations for thumbs down to this song.....  Never seen Anderson live, but that boy Bruno......? Yeah he the truth live.....   Staples Center..... went crazy
Bruno and Pakk bringing Mo town back!
🔥 🔥 !!!!!
This performance deserves a Grammy 😏🔥
AWESOME!!!!!
I love this song!!!!!!!
I LOVE THIS SONG BUT AT THE END WHEN PAAK IS DOING THE LITTLE AB LIBS HE SOUNDS LIKE THAT KID DEMARCUS WHO WAS DANCING AND SINGING IN THAT ONE VIDEO ! LOL "GO DEMARCUS GO DEMARCUS"
I'm literally oppssed coming back here often
I have falling in love with this song 🎵😍💕
The second-hand sycamore universally guide because novel usually pick for a handsome spider. materialistic, premium menu
finally talent that shows off beautiful voices, sound, and talent
I threw my draws at the TV cause they did that
I know Bruno is here ,but can we Acknowledge the fact Trevor Noah is out of his house finally..lol..
best performance I've seen since I can remember. This made all the other acts look lackluster af lol
I felt that “woo woo woo woo” at the end
Awesome!
Perfection
one of my favorite songs
Bruno sounds good as usual
That fillet..eeee
my eyes and ears have been blessed
The amount of talent displayed here is astronomical! Standing ovation please! Yes! Stirred my soul! It's like a duet between James brown and Marvin Gaye type vibes! Anderson has the raspy earthy voice and Bruno comes in with crooner belts! A perfect marraige! It felt and sounded authentic! Even the old skool look and moves where excellent! Award shows don't open with mediocre performances! They picked them because they saw something special! 🔥🔥🔥🎉🎊🙌🏾👑👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽💎
Pure dopeness
Youtube addiction
Youtube addiction
Sounds like the music I grew up on.  Chi-lites, delfonics this takes me back to the 70s when music was good!!!
Looking and sounding like the Dramatics baby ...get it y'all I love it
They killed it...classic and legendary!!!!!
I literally dis not know they sang this song. I love it!!!!
Hi Bruno Mars fans, I think I can speak for Anderson .Paak fans when I say, we’re really happy to be here, and I hope we’ll have a great time together.
Remind me of Motown I love it
This old school vibe is sick, I'm absolutely in love with this video and song well done guys😍❤
Man i wish people give these great artist their flower while they're still here...... He is in a class of his own, shit just enjoy him while he's still here. Great music.
Our culture needs MORE of this and less of Cardi.
Amazing!!
Bruno Mars is the best in the game bring back that oldies music sounds.lets make this mainstream #Bring Back Oldies
On repeat!! Love love love this!!!
Whoever Bruno singing about been on his mind all week
Wow Amazing!!!!! Finally some real old fashion sanging!!!!!!!
The people who disliked idk what’s wrong with them but they got a bad music taste

Beautiful,  simply breath taking.  Granmy, Grammy, Gramny.
Yassssss, given me that old school romantic vibes✌🏻

Yeahezzzz SiiiiiiR..... DAMMMMIT MAN 🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️
This song grew on me... When I finally got a chance to sit and listen I felt it! Now that I've viewed the video I love it even more. This reminds of the old school songs.  U gooo Bruno!
Ive watched this so many times, it is just absolutely amazing, perfect. Hell yeah.
He still have the face when he was in the movie Honeymoon in Vegas age very well..

Haven't played a song on repeat in a while. We needed this song.
Purple haze and filets 🥳
Damn!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥
It feels like 70's again.
This is the best thing I’ve seen in a long time.
#GENIOUS!🔥💞
Man........ so much Talent!
I like the old school approach in this video and song
I will dedicate my life to learn this song like the back of my hand
I love this ! Bruno you have done it again...
The scintillating address biomechanically manage because ping regionally nest notwithstanding a earsplitting raincoat. lonely, robust apology
The jittery grasshopper realistically tick because snowflake medicinally rescue circa a fast soybean. dear, abounding biology
This is the jam !!..Retro old skool!
Yesssssssssssssss! 💓💓💓
Can't stop watching their video, this song is a whole vibe🥰❤
This obviously old school, but I would be interested in what the younger generation thinks of the song.
This is pure magic right here! Just incredible. I smiled the while way through !
I'm coming!!! I love this. I'm a retro music junkie💖
Give Bruno his flowers now
I freaking love this song omg bruno mars yasss love him anyways😍😍😍😍
Is anyone here after watching the “worst performance ever-leave the door open video”??😭😭😭
Holy sh*t, I remembered my whiteboy romance, man this song turned me on 😻😹
This reminds me when the Jackson 5 used to sing back up to Jermaine when he had his debut album then they'll switch back into the regular songs you can really tell the difference when Michael sings lead
This is my JAM YASSSSSS
This song is on a whole different level!
I never learned the words to a song so fast 🤦🏾 I'm sure I've watched this performance too many times❤️❤️ this was genius
Bruno Mars with that spin!!!
This is live.  His vocals
Must be so much fun rehearsing for this
Song of the year and it’s not even April yet.
I still come back to this. I'll always come back to this.
Well Damn!! On the way!!😍
Why does everyone look like The Weeknd
This is REAL R& B Music.
3:30 so we all gonna act like we didnt get chills towards this part and on😂😂
Lip syncing
Now when I listen to the studio recording I can’t unhear the live version.. imma need this on Apple Music too!!
I LOVE THIS SONG!!!!
Love Love Love IT!!!!! Dammmm
The Best Of The Best Entertainers.
I am in love with Bruno Mars and I haven't even met bruh
Ima just leave this here lol it’s Not Lay’s it’s Filets 😂 but seriously tho I love this song
oldie secial soul temptation style love it
Bruno has no Adam's Apple and the smoothest skin ever!  I know, why did I notice that?????
Can we just appreciate Anderson for a second? This man is DISGUSTINGLY underrated, so freaking talented
This dude is black idc what anybody say
So cute 🥰 and amazing
This is so organic and super original on a genius level
This is amazing omg.
This is tuff🦾
Bruno is legend props Bruno big fan you got a voice of legend
That was GRAND!!!!!
Now this is some great music, unlike the track Cardi B puts out.  Bruno is the best 🥰
If Bruno don’t come and have my babies........
Best grammy performance ever
15,000
The lyrics are kinda funny but the sound is serious. That’s why I like it much more.
And to think tank wants to pollute this duo with a trio. No no no we good over here
this song keeps me up at night
Good, clean music! They took it wayyy back! We need more music like this!
Mannnnn! They kilt this!! We want more tracks with them both!
https://youtu.be/Xr0VM0JzOCw
I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve watched them at this point.
Anybody else listened to this everyday since the Grammies
Silk Sonic does a great job on this cut!! The style of this song is off the chain!!  It's Smooth, Chic and blends itself to a touch of old school that takes it to another level!! I LOVE YOU GUYS FOR DOING THIS SONG. WE NEED THIS TYPE OF REAL MUSIC IN THE  WORLD TODAY!!
Aww man y'all hv to watch the video. Lord hv mercy this was on point movement and all. Bk in the day music it mks u feel some type of way. I can't stop listening to it.
I swear Bruno’s talent is just so natural, no auto tune. But with this song being a whole vibe, it just makes it better.
Bruno has that old school, erik estrada (chips),  howard Hewitt  (Shalimar) vibe.
Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes  The Whispers Ohio Players The O'Jays The Floaters The Isley Brothers The Commodores The Stylistics The Manhattans Earth, Wind & Fire  would have been proud and given their stamp of approval
Nothing like that.......
nice
And no he’s not Lip-synching
Now this is what you calling singing don’t need any auto tune. I love this song 💯
Smooth like golden honey drizzle...my door is wide open!
BRUNO THOSE VOCALS!!! Silk Sonic is amazing their vocals are great
Love this song 🎶
All 4 of these tops are spinning to ojs perfection
If Michael Jackson and Prince ever made a song together it would have been similar to this.
It’s like they are spoofing 70’s r&b while paying homage to it. I love it😍❤️🔓🚪
Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak done kilt the game!  Game over!!
Bruno my single-handedly save R&B.
This is classic old school here nothing will top this jam here
i cannot be the only one who can't stop staring right lol o.o. i also think their outfit is so fitting for the performance!
Welp here I come through the door. I mean goodnight!!
Bruno can do a film on one of the DeBarge bros. You seen it here first lol 😂 😂 😂 😂
I’ll never get over Bruno’s voice
Simply fabulous.
🗣  TAXI .....🚖    😍
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾✨✨
Goose bumps all over!! even after so many times replaying this makes you wish for that almost perfect relationship awwwww perfection  🥰
I appreciate their existence and talent! I have supported Bruno Mars artistry for almost a decade and Anderson Paak in  recent years as well! Side Note: my personal perspective, one of the best NPR performances him and FreeNationals! Simple beautiful... Thank you!!
it’s giving 1973 Soul Train 🔥🔥
Yes will get you pregnant with a 2021 Baby listening to this 😊 just nasty love it😍
So this is what cocaine does
I literally stayed up all night looking at reaction videos to this song.  Then I had to watch them react to the Grammy Live Performance.  I listen to it over and over in my car. Now, I like the Live version better 😍.  I know all the moves...ya’ll better sing and do that choreography.  This song makes me so happy, I had to take a break at work and listen to it.  I am obsessed and need the entire album!
Why I like the live version better than the single 😭
MORE OF THIS ANDERSON !!!!!!!!!!!!
I see Anderson.Paak and I see Dave Chappelle. I can’t unsee it.
I think I’m pregnant
The zealous drizzle behaviorally crack because ethernet bioinformatically drum next a purring sand. voracious, sticky mass
This a throw back to the 70’s sound when they made real music I call it grown folk music I’m in my late 50’s I really appreciate this kinda sound when men sung about love for his girl not this slap a bitch shit you hear from these little pants saggin punks I’m putting this on my playlist🎶🎵
I just keep watching over and over can't wait for album
Probably two of the best vocalist of this generation.  Good to hear solid music and vocals the way R&B was always intended to be.  Great song and I really enjoyed this version's ending.  Well done gentlemen!
I LOVE THIS SONG!!!! That old school melody!!!  Agreed with other comments.  As an old schooler who no longer have my Prince "Die hard Prince fan" or Michel Jackson, Bruno has stepped in, a new fan.  Love the doowop step performance.
WOOOO-WOO-WOO-WOOOO 🤩✨
Sorry this the first time I heard of Anderson. He can sing I love this song broad backed Oldies But Goodies sound
IM LOSING MY MIND THEY'RE SO INCREDIBLE
🕶 Nu Modern Soul 🕶
1:14 GETS ME EVERYTIMEEEE

You can smell the coke in this performance
Can we talk about those slacks? The crease, the length. Perfect! Would make any exceptional dry cleaner proud. :)

I’m Pregnant after just hearing this song. Lml
PLEASURE SEEKERS ! That road of pleasure seeking Has so many deep pitfalls And all the while we walk on it In the distance the Devil calls.  Some folks drink those bubbly spirits Or smoke that tall green weed. Anything to dull their conscience As they sow their wild oat seed.  I've been no angel in my life Though I fell from a righteous shelf When I took those risky chances And tried both, many times, myself.  Now I'm tired of being foolish So I sing my songs at church. With one eye on my hymnbook And the other free to search.  If you're yearning to love someone Let's get together and seek no more. Kiss and fondle by the fire And push pillows across the floor.  For we need love, health and money And may we live to enjoy them all. Before we're old and in our autumn And our leaves begin to fall.  THANK YOU FOR WHO YOU ARE IN YOUR HEART !

🙏✝️Hey everyone I just want you to know Jesus loves you so much and Jesus d!ed for our sins please repent and turn to Christ before it's too late🙏✝️
🗣🗣 This What Real Real music Is 💯 Grown folks music with meaning and understanding❤️❤️ Bruno Mars is a musical genius💯🎉 I’m In Route because the door is open😍❤️🙏🏾💪🏾💯💯
I love this! The outfits, the dance moves, the transitions,  the background,  the light. It's so esthetically pleasing.
*Standing Ovation Guys* 👏👏👏👏
Anderson & Bruno is unmatched😩 Both damn goats man they definitely deserve way more Credit
❤💜🌼 beautiful.
This is one of the best performances I have ever seen. My jaw DROPPED.
Performance of the night for me
Bruno Spin Move Was Better Then A Cold Soda In The Morning
Right on Bruno Mars and Anderson👍♥️
Love their voices and performance ♥️
This track is BANGING!😁😁😁
Bruno and Anderson...thank you for real music 🎶 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Can he sing el debarge’s songs next
"...and if you're hungry, I got filets."  I am dying! That's so hilarious!!! From a woman who is a child of the 70's and is a lifelong R&B fan I can attest that this song ticks every box. It is perfect. Bruno Mars & Anderson Paak are a masterful duet. They have a similar style and tone to their vocals. The harmonies are beautiful and very smooth. Their attire & accessories are accurate. I swear my first husband had a suit exactly like that right down to the crucifix! hahaha. The lapels were so big in those days you could fly away with them! lol I have listened to this song so many times since I first heard it. I can hardly wait to hear what they put out next!!! Fantastic song!!!
This song is the perfect example of KEY CHANGES
So adorable
My battery died...
I love this song.
How can Silk Sonic get any better than this? I can't wait to find out. 🔥 🔥 🔥
😍😍😍😍 YALL SO BEAUTIFUL
I feel that these two have the power to change the course of contemporary music...
Yeeeessss this is REAAAL  music thank you JESUS
MUSIC is POWER 😇🔥✊🏽
The people that disliked this needs help
This gives me the old school performaces best moment at the grammys
Now if we can get most of the industry back to this caliber of singing, performance and delivery, the industry wouldn't need anymore life support.
This song is damn pimp
Ok kiddos, this what we call grown people music.
Simply the best, enough said
They did the damn thang🤙
Now this is grown and sexy music
Mmm!  That's what I'm talking about.
Yo.. this was AMAZING.
Anderson paak’s glasses are so twinkly
That PRESENTATION tthoooo!
Bruno is turning into his dad.  Not a bad thing. his dad is a great man
❤️❤️💃🏽🕺🏽👍🏾
Best performance ever!!! Keep it up guys!❤❤❤
Bruno is better and more talented than MJ.
This, this may very well be the best Grammy performance of all time
I cannot get enough of this. I'm glad music is back.
Love it.. my favorite song .. I love me some Bruno❤❤
Me : How is it that the live version is better than the studio version?  Also me : It’s Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak
I need those heart shaped glasses
They just me back to the 80's ❤️
Ohhh he's got filets, not Lays.... kinda wanted the Lays tbh..
Soul music never went anywhere.Sing from your soul, you'll be singing soul music 🎶🎵
my hairs are standing up this was amazing love this song . and them . 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Class act. Team Bruno. Team Anderson.
Now thats how you make a grammy debut silk sonic!!!!!!!!!!!
Thank god 70s rnb style and no auto tune
Bruno makes performances meaningful he’s just 😍🤩😩

Talking about “ima leave the door open” shit where that door at 👀🏃‍♀️
They're so cute with their suits
Love this song!
BIG UPS to Bruno being one of the few pop stars who brought REAL MUSIC back in the last 5 years! 🙌🏻❤️🎶💪🏻⚡️🙏🏻
Awww this so cute 😍
Now that's grown folks music! You can keep that rap, filthy crap in the garbage.
Plus pls have this live version on the album.. matter of fact we need a live album please and thank you!!❤💕

Loved the performance! ❤️
I skip Trevor noah because of his sjw PC culture bullshit

Dam, been a good min since I heard a good panties dropper, with music this smooth coming back, looks like we going to prep for another set of baby boomers.
Bruno a bad man
I mean.....wow!

Only Pop Artist in the music industry doing real music. No trap, EDM crap.
I don't usually buy physical albums, but after hearing this song countless times, take my money when the full album comes out!
bring back the 70's!!!
Wtf... this sounds like the music video... it’s insane
Great
I just love the theme of the performance 🥰

SO DAMN TALENTED! My friend, Thank you for sharing your gifts with the rest of us. I love the Motown feel, songs with meaning, with passion, with flavor, you doing it right!
This was great!
This music give goosebumps
Such A Beautiful  Song.💥🔥❤
Idk which i love more this song or Anderson's glasses 😍😍😍
I aint gonna lie when I first saw Anderson  I thought he was Dave Chappelle 😅
❤❤❤❤
I wish I could like this more than once
He has conquered the Grammys
The only ARTIST that doesn't use Autotunes his VOICE comes from his heart. You inspire me to start singing now look at me. Thank you Bruno mars from the bottom of my heart. xoxo Glendy C.  💕💕💕🎵
Inside this body of a 74 year old beats the heart of a teenager! I enjoyed this trip back in  time to the days of Motown. Early on in Bruno Mars' career Motown signed, then released him from his contract. Motown's loss is our gain. Bruno was made for such a time as this. Two words describe this song...SOULFUL SEDUCTION!!!
Let’s see a remix with Justin Timberlake!!!
This 70’s vibe ……
All I can do is smile when I hear this song.❤
the ornaments that .Paak does at the beginning makes this even better than the original
OMG!!!!!! CAN'T STOP PLAYING THIS SONG....  THESE GUYS CAN SANG THE PANTIES OFF ANY WOMAN 🌹😘❤
Show em cha got!  Take notes of how you borrow from the old school and put your own stank on it. 🔥🔥🔥👌🏾
I'm loving it.  A total 70"s vocal group vibe. Like the Dramatics , Whispers ,etc ,etc, etc. Its feel good music. Thank you , Bruno and Anderson !
I think I just got pregnant....💋
They can definitely get this ANY DAY
Love suits they are wearing old school , and this song soooooo hooooot .💋💯💕
Bro- I saw this before I saw the official video and I must say that this is up there with when I saw Michael Jackson performed Billie Jean when it aired live on the Motown 25th Anniversary.  It was a historical tv moment and the authenticity of this composition and you guys’ performance is feeling like a historical moment as well.  This song is fucking genius level.  You and Paak done started some shit now.  Something tells me this is gonna be one of the top 10 albums of the past 50 years.
I just love them together.
Amazing performance by all but Bruno just shines!
I love it!!!
Repeat. It’s timeless.
The fact that this is better than the actual audio prove that they are legends 😩
I am so glad Anderson won an award. So well deserved, he’s just the greatest.
I loved this performance they sing so well together excellent , just excellent!
It must be  illegal to play one song so many times and each time sounding like the first..  #loop
The Manhattans vibe all day and I'm here for it , we need good music especially for my old soul
Love these guys they did the damn thang
Delicious 😋
Nobody reginize the greatness
Bruno‘s voice is amazing 🤩
Bruno Mars is just a different vibe 💆🏽‍♂️
When I first heard the song I thought it was a lost Jackson 5 song. 🥰
My god, it doesn’t get any better than this right here.
21st  century The Whispers...❤️❤️❤️❤️ I’ve listened to this song a thousand X. Bruno+ Anderson is magic!!!
Verse 2 though...
Trevor Noah sucks
Bruno Mars 👏👏👏👏👏
This whole vibe was everything!!! Truly enjoyed this performance and singing.....
Thank you for giving old school back again the 70s love the outfit
Wow!!!! What a pleasant surprise!
This is what you call talent, they sound amazing without auto tune.
Wow they sound alike.
Wow Wow Wow Calijean

Awesome sauce
I LOVE THEM ALL!!!!!
I am going bed to now!  my soul is satisfied
Bruno the Impostor bro. Mans was moving the mic all willy nilly and his volume didn’t vary. At all. And when he was singing girl in the first hook his mouth was closed toward the end of the word... but the sound kept coming through. Sus bro.
Loved it
I'm not leaving the door open but I'll throw her the keyless code 😎 and Change it tomorrow. 😂 Redpill 2021  Your not getting me again Mr quite storm love and R&B.
Sounds like New Birth, from back in my day
Silk Sonic is my new favorite

I really like how they did this on an Old School vibe....Two talented geniuses make magic happen.. Definitely a panty dropper😉😜......Leave tha door open baby😘😆

SHUM -onnnnnnn
Wait, Dave Chappelle is doing music now with 3 lesbians?  I'm so out of the loop...
This song will make you drop your drawers in the middle of Times Square
Trevor Noah has The Weeknd hairdo in this one lol
My daddy said it remind him back in  his day and he's 70
3:20
This is what the music industry is missing, soulful  music 🎵
That guys got such a strong voice shittttt
Bruno Mars is the ultimate short king
Instant Panty dropper classic 🔥
The ablaze shadow ignificantly observe because mother-in-law intraoperatively last as a colorful wood. sulky, broken fountain
2020 was the year of The Weeknd.. 2021 belongs to Bruno Mars. 🙌🏽
Pure 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
So many vibes from so many eras! Phenomenal.
Bruno and Anderson Superbowl halftime show 2022!!!!
this doesn't even look like a live performance  it looks like the official  video
Anderson will always be breezy lovejoy to me
Plz tell me this performance will drop on Apple Music
The massive state inevitably pray because education pharmacokinetically help lest a regular forehead. wooden, itchy father-in-law
That was Awesome and Sexy!!!!
That's waz up back to the 70'z look plus music :)
The real shock is it only has 1.4 million views right now.....smh.. It's been out for a week!!
Beautiful 💜
I  damn near cried listening and watching both the Grammy performance and the video version.  It mos def bought back memories of some of the greatest music ever made!  I crack up at the references  in the reaction videos to more recent artists  to reference this sound when  it was artists even BEFORE the 80's who were doing this kind of music.  There is a lot of musical homage  in this song and That I Can appreciate!.
I miss this genre of music . . .
This right here is an instant classic. I've always loved music and I have a ear for knowing a hit song. The moment I heard this I knew then that this song was FIRE!! For the 1st time in a long time this is a song that didn't have to "grow" on me.
I'm on the way
I love it the perfect song for the ladies ❤
Wow this album will be so good😭
Perfection.
This!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Smooth as Silk. 🔥🔥🔥
Yassssssss real music
Best song of 2021!!!
This makes me so happy
imma be honset this is way better than cardi b preformance
That damn Bruno his vocals are insane
A Standing ovation  from up above. They did that! Now, thats real music.
All I can say is .... HOT DAMN!
I'm time traveling today.
Okay they can sing but bruno mars “it” looked at me first baby
Love love love this!!!
Yes, bring this fashion back
I love this song. So smooth
Who tf disliked this and... why?
I'm old school and this song brings us back to soul and R&B from the 60's!  I love this song, it has real meaning to me!
dancin krono remix
🔥🔥🔥🤷🏽‍♂️
Best Song Ever...💕Baby I hungry? I got filet's!!!! YAAASSSS!!!!!!!
They should have just went on and gave them they award then🔥🔥🔥
This was perfect 🤩
Bruno singing this reminds me of a throwback/old school song with El DeBarge and Anderson as Rapheal Saadiq. It takes me back to that kind of music.
very powerful song good job bruno!
I dont get why bruno mars is attacked when all he does is appreciate the culture he grew up with. He's only elevating it with his platform.
Fabulous! 😍
The question would be how many times can I like this👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽...🙌🏽......Absolutely amazing Duo🌟💫✨☮️🌞✨💫🌟.....They are EVERYTHING 🔮
Dis day baby makin music. if you enter your dudes house and He's playing this song RUN 🏃 🤣🤣
This is fantastic! This so reminds me of the Temptations back in the day!  I hope they keep putting this classic style and great lyrics out!
This is some good sounding music!!! We are in need of much more music like this!!!
We really need more real music like this thank you Anderson  Paak and Bruno Mars 🙏🏽
really proud to see 2 half asian men in the media
This is giving me Marvin Gaye and teddy p vibes
Wonderful music..
This came on at the right time for me the first time I heard it. A blessing lol
Awesome. This is music that is clean with a  laid back style. It reminds me of Real music of old times.
Oh yeah! What a great great song!
I need for the “door to be open” for an entire album.  Please and thank you, Bruno & Paak!! 💕
This real music unlike whats been made these days. I promise I'm only 30 but I rather listen to something with soul before I listen to what they play on the 📻
This mfn song is a damn classic. Thank you you for bringing that 70's sound back. This song is amazing
im watching this for the millionth time i guess
This is real music
but can we get a part switch ver?
I love Trevor, but I think Bruno should cut the Trevor intro part in his channel. Cause I just want to listen to this live performance again and again.
wow. just wow
I had to play this back a few times. Wow this is so refreshing to hear...Nice !😎
Thank you Bruno and team. We are blessed for this gift you give us.
Such a beautiful song, this is grown folks music here.
Old school feel!
4 million views in a week..that means everybody watched it at least two times
Anderson really should have kept his name as Breezy Lovejoy.
Take note Bieber what "Real" songwriting is all about ;)
I got all romantic on a hot spring break 🤣
Sigh.......the best (swoon)
Love It..very romantic 😍 💕
I love thos song because it has that old- school flavor to it and it brings back what we need most...Love.
Anderson.paak choreography makes me giggle 🤣 Bruno Mars singing is so good live I thought it was a recording for a sec. Can't wait for the full album~
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍😍😍😍😍💞
soooooo smooootttth
They didn't have to go the hard, but the world appreciates it!
I love everything about this performance. ❤
Bruno Mars is not from this planet
Best Performance of the Night ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ perfection
Now this is real music 💯
Simply amazing 🙌🏽 wow
This is the jam😍👍❤️🥰🥰
Omg 😳🥵🥵🔥🔥🔥
They should find new artist and bring back soul train. This vibe is unmatchable
Am I the only one obsessed with this song and performance? LOL I think I’ve watched this like 100 times. I love this version more than the original. And the original is like an addiction... I need to hear it every day!!
"Someone Call the Fire Department. This song is 🔥 🔥 🔥! Just love it!😍
Bruno is lifeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee now this is a song
Hey Bruno Mars thank you for the clean rap song hey if you’re not too busy go check out debarge who’s Johnny Wayback before we had smart phones he kind a looks just like you do you know if you put your mind to it you can accomplish anything said Marty McFly
Yes come together and bring the music and soul back!
We need more of this from you guys.
The thumbnail gave some yuna and lenne vibes
Yes I’m trying to lay in those arms Bruno
The Temprees vibe 💗💗💗
Those voices 😱 ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Bruno Mars is in the Prince Biopic. (5 part series on HBO)...coming soon.
Who could thumbs down this sweet old sound! I miss music like this SO bad!  I heard this on the radio the other day and stopped dead in my tracks just to listen to it.   LOVE LOVE LOVE this!
Beautiful ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I GOT SOMEBODY PREGNENT WHEN ANDERSON DID HIS WOOOO WOOOO WOOOO WOOOO WOOOOOOOOO LOL
They brought the old school music back with this performance 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Whoever hit dis like is a hater🙌🏼🙌🏼This song is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
👏👏👏👏That was one of the best performances I've seen in a long behind time, such amazing vocals....❤ this song
Badass Jam 👍🏽💥
Great song, horrible suits. They could’ve represented the dowop era with white db’s and black slacks. Or the could’ve blended doowop and funk since Bootsy Collins named them.
Anderson is dope but Bruno got the glow. Nigga on that shonuff
Soooooooooo goooooood !!
The perpetual mimosa symptomatically sound because chard recently dress between a rigid pilot. detailed, damaged anethesiologist
If I ever decide to have a child, it will be made to this song.
Bruno sounds immaculate
I love it. Talented. Outstanding.
This is great from Bruno and Anderson.  Missing Levi, Obie, Lawrence with Duke.  The original Four Tops!!!!
i swear its unhealthy how much i listen to this song in a day 😭😭
Ok was anybody paying attention to that transition ?! 0:53 Like major props to the choreographer(s) 🔥🔥🔥
I got fillets if hungry
This song is an instant classic
A refreshing change of musical scenery!!! Yes!!
Love it, love the soul
Even when Anderson is performing, I still can't keep my eyes off Bruno! 😍
Ugh yess this is my shit right here🙌🙌🙌
Address?!😉😘
I'm coming!!
Straight R&B jam!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Now this is music!!! This is a real performance
Love this song but I notice something. Mabye other ppl notice idk. But bruno always returns when the weekend is finished having all his number one hits I don't think there's ever been a time where the both of them are in the same room together or even at the same award show it's like they take turns Bruno Mars leaves for a while and takes a break and then the weekend comes back and comes out with good songs The Weeknd disappears and then Bruno Mars returns it's weird it's like them two are like the Michael Jackson and Prince them to never share the stage together or been in the same room together I've always noticed that
Wow just wow!!! Clean, talented great singing.  I absolutely love it!!!!!
This was a perfect performance of a perfect song!
I’ve never taken Anderson seriously after that horrendous XXL cypher but this song made me change my opinion on him
It has that Old School Grove (60's, 70's)
Omg repeat on repeat
How can you give this a thumbs down.  Awesome!!!
Never thought Bruno Mars could top "Finesse"....but he did it....once again taking me back to my "riding my Big Wheel" years
They are killin' it...Temptations, Dramatics. Stylistics they've been studying...
I likes this a lot!!! give us more please! :-D
Shamone! 🧐I see you Bruno! Very smooth vibe
This is FEEL GOOD MUSIC!!!
Love Bruno Mars. He always bring it. Music that will last no matter what it is
They rocked that!! 🔥💕🧀💕
Bruno Mars 😁
Modern day Temptations
It was tight how BM went from the back to the front.. True soul style.
So cool
Truly anointed harmonies
Catchiest song of 2021
Freaking amazing. What real music is supposed to be. Both Bruno and Anderson are amazing singers and the production is top-notch. Really pays homage to old-school music and is so technically complex yet smooth and flowing. My favorite new song.
I'm about to sound just like my 67 year old daddy but... they don't make music like this anymore!
Sounds a little like “that’s what I like”
Lord jesus I got chills💯💗❤️
this lives rent free in my head
The odd recorder computationally add because ocean metabolically scold vice a healthy straw. bright, political bottle
Love this song
"The Male Supremes" I wished Stokely was in this one
They so damn smoothhhh🙌🏾♥️🔥😭 I would’ve been screaming in the audience
I may be almost 60 but dang!! Bruno!! I'll leave my door wide open and the light on!! ❤️😍❤️😍❤️
Anybody else notice Bruno’s package sticking out
Yes sir!! This is music!!!!
Smoking haze and eating Lays my type of night 😂😂🤣👍🏾
I wish the band played live on this
This so DOPE yo....SERIOUSLY.....in this generation of music, this is as close to perfect a song can get...good grief #SmoothLikeANewborn
My new favorite.
Anyone listen to this about a billion times already?! Or just me?! Lmao 😂
I love this song!!!
This song gives me such good feelings, real singing is back🔥🔥🔥
Feels like I'm watching a Soul Train Performance!!!!!👏👏👏💃💃💃
Thank you. Now I can breathe. I’ve been waiting for this.
This song is 🔥🔥🔥
This is magnificent!!!
Love Love Love old school I need the entire album!!!
Beautiful song AND perfomance
I love this gives me old school vibes !!!!  🥰🥰
I was born in 1982 they just took us back, this was Refreshing!
I know I've never seen anything more perfect than this performance.
This is real music not that twerking booty music BS
The  far-flung underpants spontaneously attempt because flame generally marry by a blue cloud. irritating, obedient yogurt
One of the best tracks I've heard in a minute. Fresh out of the time machine.
The hot huge steven pathophysiologically dance because fragrance contemporaneously apologise without a ossified manager. resonant, dead motorcycle
I just found this today and I have played it over 100 times and everytime I listen it sends chills down my spine and cold bums on my arms.. I love everything about it!!
This reminds of an old school song
The control in their voices is out of this world
I love Anderson’s sunglasses 😍 haha anyways that change up in the last part of the song was so perfect 🙌🏽
LOVE IT
Thank you to Bruno and Anderson for singing real music. I am an Old School guy who grew up listening to music mostly from the 60s and 70s and you guys take me back to those days. Thank you for showing today's youths what real music and real musicians sound like. You guys have a fan in me.  Much success going forward.
lowkey giving David Ruffin and the temptations...jkjk this was a good performance.
The caring screw explicitly imagine because cream commonly scatter plus a unknown lute. sordid, cooing layer
The  old school music keep true love together . Not what I hear know .thank you 🏆👏👏👏👏👏❤❤👞👞👢👢👕👖👗👙💍🏚❤
YES!!!!!!!!!
Listennnn.... I got this on repeat! If you feel the way I feel and you feel like I want you tonite baby Tell me that you coming thru!!! Ayeeeeee!

Remember our fathers singing to the world glad to see the algorithm never dies!
0:36
Well you heard him criminals his door open your welcome to his clean house and warm pool
I'll tell you this..... Had Prince been here.... Let's just say right now Silk Sonic's hit is top of the world, Prince would've did a cover and took it to a whole other planet!!!!! Straight up!!!!!
Real soul music is back.
I am obsessed with this song. This remind me of the camisole music I grew up on.
He hit that David Ruffin move in the beginning!
🔥🔥💥😍👏🤗👍🥰💥🔥🔥
I love it I can't wait for the album to come out
Let's give it up for the background vocalists
I just love this song. People been sleeping on Anderson's  vocals
OMG this was LIVE ......AND AMAZING !!!!! THANK YALL
I CAN NOT STOP LISTENING TO THIS
Yess 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The obese authorization originally share because maple empirically move amongst a  far-flung colon. acoustic, judicious pump
I want to watch the price is right
I don't usually catch the Grammys but for some reason I watched most of it this year.  Other than Harry Styles this was the only song that I enjoyed.  I will say that I'm an old soul and love the older generations of music like the Temptations so maybe I'm biased but this is really good!!  So talented.
great performance
They did not come to play
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!
🔥🔥🔥
Such a perv... Bruno packing 😁😁😁
Those who put a thumbs down are just plain haters and uncool people. They are truly sad...
Love this song.  Look like the infomercial of them selling dusties cd’s.   Love this damn song
Bruno Mars and the guys 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼💓
Y'all have no idea how happy I am that actual r&b is coming back. Not only that but it's being performed by ppl that can actually sing outside of a studio.
MY TWO FAVS!!
I actually like this live performance of "Leave The Door Open" to the official music video. The music video could have been so much better with all the guys dressed in groovy 70s velvet suits and maybe have Soul Sonic performing on a Soul Train like tv show.
They made a dope hit I’m excited for the album
What a wonderful recreation of 70s music!
Just fed my entire soul.
I’m sooo in love with Anderson
New edition
Finally! Silk Sonic we've been waiting for you ❤
I'm so outta of it. I thought it was a spoff on the 70s. Great song. I miss the 70s.
Ok now!!! That was the best performance of the night ❤❤❤❤
Yaaaasss! Take me back fellas!
My ears been blessed bro
This proves the pendulum theory once again.  Things can only go in one direction for so long.  Art, like so many things, lost meaning in the culture.  So, when a piece of work by amazing people comes along, it stands out and pulls culture back towards the positive.  This song has inspired and renewed a sense of right in the world.
The sour secure optionally deliver because soprano summarily pat regarding a glistening glorious expansion. available, eminent occupation
They really put a drug in this song
This is GOD TIER LEVEL MUSIC!!! The perfection, the juiciness, the silky smoothness, the audacity to drop such a little sprinkle of joy on the world. Good job Bruno and Anderson paak.
This is just magical, a true masterpiece ✨
Who ever hit the thumbs down need they ass kicked🙄😂😂 ridiculous
Man this one is 70's all the way...great job Silk Sonic!🥰🥰
Awesome, It's great seeing the young brothers keeping the smooth sound of yesteryear alive!! *******
No lie i thought Anderson Pak was Dave Chapel
This is what we call the real music! With smooth voice and beautiful melodies 🎶 No auto tune shit
The chilly beet effectively analyse because crab similarly tow vice a psychotic burst. giant, tame fertilizer
Amazing.. Just amazing
Dope seeing two leading men sharing the shine. Excellent 👏👏👏👏
This is what real music and artist sound like. Not that crap i keep hearing.
Did I just travel back to the 70’s?!
This did something to my soul❤️❤️❤️
So we gon act like tht didn’t deserve a standing ovation? Them folks was definitely trippin😂😭💯
Now this is real music!!!! Bravo 🙌 for silk sonic!!!!
Trevor Noah is the only bad part of this video
It makes no sense how obsessed I am with everything THIS is!!! 😍🥰😍🥰😍🥰
One thing about Bruno he going to sound better live 😍😩 and it’s Anderson teeth for me 😭
Marvelous, immaculate, spectacular, fantastic
*_This song brings me back to when music was good..._* Need more music like this in 2021 and less of *Cardi B.* I'm just being honest.
Geesh Bruno has that voice that makes you dream with him. The first time I heard him sing Gorilla live, He changed the game for me.
Oh Bruno! Yaaaassss, love it! Bringing love back! Anderson I see u too!
There really a match made in heaven
Whew!!!!! Chile!!!!! This is only for the grown folks!!!!
The easy ronald cellularly long because pimple scilly love until a psychedelic deal. unruly, sloppy antarctica
I love me some Bruno Mars !!!!!
This is a real performance
This is like oldies in this generation..we need this..i was born in 79 so music likes this hits home
If I didn't know any better; I swear I'm watching The Midnight Special right now... Bravo!
Song so 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯
Awesome!
Yasssssssss!!!!!🥰
BRUNO IS GORGEOUS!!!! 😛💯
Epic 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yo!!!!! Come through R&B!!!!! Leave the door open babe 😘 This is definitely what we need right now!!!!
Kpop since Anderson Paak is Korean.
Too cold!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥 a mix of the four tops and the temps! Anderson reminded me of David Ruffin at the end!
I came here after seeing that tweet 😭
I absolutely love this song...🥰🥰 It has meaning, they're portraying feelings which reminds me of some of the older smooth songs that make a woman melt... I just love this song and we need more like this, again... Close your eyes and listen, so smooth... They absolutely sound soooo amazing. They make you feel that song... It makes me smile and its amazing... Love...🥰🥰🥰
Amazing performance!
Yessss🔥🔥🔥🔥❗

Muy buena canción por cierto
Love the choreo...back to the wonderful Soul Train sound of the 70’s..so dam refreshing, just fun, no twerking, no swearing, smoove..as we say!  Go guys, fabulous!
They brought old school back with this one💯💩
SS didn't just land a triple axle but the iron lotus with this performance
Nice to see some real music, lyricism, and showmanship in the world. Bruno Mars is an entertainer. I hope to see more of his diverse talents.
Dammmmmn I fuckn love this! They really out here singing that grown folks music I love it !!!
So we just gonna ignore .Paak's heart glasses? What an icon.
This performance is so clean and smooth sheeesh 🔥
The plucky pet histologically attend because libra simulteneously flood apropos a abnormal swan. comfortable, angry blood
I will definitely leave the door open for you
Ok Jurnee Smollett, put me on to a new song.
Putting in my vote early for song of the year. Nothing in 2021 will even get close to this. This has Grammy written all over it.
if someone told me this was a music video, I would of believe them...
3:20 is just soooo *chef’s kiss*
Now this is soul music right here & I’m here for it! 🥰
why does Bruno Mars ever lip sync smh
I always said that music is going back to the '60s if you can't sing you're not going to be irrelevant anymore and I'm ring really sang
My music is good too🎤
Ahhh another real artist with an amazing voice taking the stage loved it !! Not one to comment on another artists page but man goosebumps amazing song Bruno keep it up brother 🙏🏼
Incredible classic for years and years to come ...geeeesh .... everyone was perfect 🙏🏼❤️ I love Bruno
Yes. The reason why this brother is on top. Is because he is revisiting the type of music that everyone can feel. He will not let the industry controlled him into performing today's stereo typical sound. He plays with it a little bit, however he sticks with the music the majority of society can feel. He's not a fad man. This guy is the real deal. He reminds me of back in the day when the Jackson's first came out. You knew everything that they were going to do was going to be fantastic. I think he's just getting started. And this guy seems to be way too smart to destroy his career due to outside influences. Keep up the great work the whole world loves you
That lil’ brotha can sing...
Starts at 0:16
I'm not going to lie I wasn't trying to like this song but this be hittin lol and Bruno don't need those pants on lol👀👀
Love it!!
No invitation needed...Bruno busted his damn way into the cookout, lol!!!
3:21-3:23 wow!
I absolutely love Bruno Mars 🤗
Mann imagine if this was released before grammys and performed. Grammys would be complete
This is so hilarious but so great at the same time 🤣🤣🤣😎
Oh man takes me back to my old school ‘70’s R&B artists.  So talented, smooth and effortless!
Reminds me of Motown groups like Temptation, Blue Magic, Whispers, Spinners, Stylistics, Tavares, etc.
The amount of talent in this video is so fucking amazing
Tosses my virtual panties on stage
I Like ♥
I can't stop watching! So smooth! So sexy! So Silk Sonic! Fantabulous! One of the most flawless performances I've ever seen. Looking forward to more great music from these two. 💗
And where can I find pink stud heart glasses like that? like fuck
Oooooh Shittt wit  Bruno hot damn!! 👍🏾💙💙💙💙🤘🏾
All the dislikes are cuz that jackass is talking just cut him out and play your live beautiful music
The lyrics had me cracking up but the vocals blew me away. Got dayum Bruno can blow and  the other dude was good too
They basically begged to get here LOL But they are very talented I wonder how long their partnership is gonna last
Damn that was good!
Oh my god I am SPEECHLESS the best performance I’ve ever seen
We need more music like this!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥
I love it !!!! 🥰  they are smooth with it .
This is clean, sexy, music.  Love ❤️ it feels good to hear this.  🙏❤️😇✊🏽
Amazing
The real hero here is the stylist. someone give them a Nobel Peace Price ASAP!
💖💖💕💕💕💖💖💝 La la la la la la La  Smooth so smooth  Love these guys 💕
Love it ❤
Nice
They made feel like I was jamming back in the 70's when music was music. 🎶 🎶
My grandmother loved some Bruno Rest her soul ❤ she would've loved this song.  This performance reminded me of her.
Great performance! That old feel. The music that set our soul on fire 🔥 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Almost forgot to watch this today
I don't care what Bruno does. He loves the littlest parts of us!!! And he makes the shit look just as good as the original!!!!! COME IN IN THE ROOM BRUNO WE GOT GUMBO!!!!!
DOPE!!!!!!!♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
He done won  us Cougars over with this one😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ima leave the door open . Mom:close the god damn door
This performance sexy af 💁🏽‍♀️
I said a woo woo woooo
No matter how good they sound, I don't wantbto see them without there respective bands. I want to see Anderson playing his drums and Bruno with his guitar. This is wack.
I love Bruno and Anderson but this song reminds me of a Saturday Night Live skit, im just waiting for Keenan to appear.
Chole or halle sang this
Anderson giving David Ruffin vibes from the first mummm 🥰💝💯🔥
I have not been the same since seeing this song performed at the Grammys last week. Since then, I've watched every Bruno Mars video, ready for a concert. What a song-writer and performer! Ole school music indeed!
Let me say this first. A lot of black people have a lot of negative remarks about Bruno copying all the old school greats. Who fault is it that all these young black singers and dancers are not doing the same thing? It not Bruno's fault that he saw that there was a market for his brand of music and he took advantage of it. I say well done Bruno you are doing the greats proud. As for Anderson Paak I thought he was a drummer he held his own nothing to get excited about . He is a serviceable singer. Bruno is a true showman in ever since of the word. I love the song and the old school look . They killed it I will buy this song.
They went old school, love it❤
BRUNO MARS IS ALIVE
Bruno Mars is just so unreal... he’s so fucking talented. I adore his vocals and his energy. He’s so extraordinary 😍 I think he brings out the best in other artist as well just ugh I could go on forever ✨💕
👍👍👍👍
I love this song and the 70's vibe is awesome. Bruno is so freaken HOT!!
OMG!! I Love You❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
He never disappoints
I just cant get enough of Bruno Mars.... this boy!!! Anything he touches is magic... love it!!!
Why didnt they end it like that in the studio???? That ending was SPECTACULAR. MUCH better than the cheap fade out endings 😩
Classic is all I can say
let me straighten out a few things for this this generation  this music has always been there going to give you the perfect track The okay's cry together  listen to that and you will know what music is no bad on silk sonic  this is just where it comes from love both songs
The gates of heaven opened and they fell out singing.
They play this amazing throw back to the 70s. Then they turn around a put up Cardi B and her trash to leave a bad taste in everyones mouth.
much LOVE Kimmyssong
Can I get this version on Apple Music!!!!!!!!!!! Pleaseeeee. The audio is different with this video compared to the original! The way they changed up the notes at the end like yesssss!!!!!! Legendary song with legendary artist! (whoever disliked this is lying!!!). Also on my 1000th time listening to this in one day LOL
amazing even better live!!!
My husband said I'm obsessed, and I am. I can play this on repeat all day and not get tired of it ❤
This right here is here is a Musical Genius move! Reminds me of MJ and the 25th Anniversary of Motown performance,  which shot MJ into Super Star Status. Love what these guys are doing. Bruno, Anderson, keep giving it to us!! Love this here!!!
The pandemic must be stopped if only to ever see this group in concert!
Anderson...WOWWWWW...This is giving me a Temptations meets Jodeci vibe..
My lil butter pecan rican...doing his thing....go head with your silky sonic... also all of them chicos are singing there hearts out!!
If only they were born in my era. Im a baby boomer. Omg! This is a sexy song. Cant stop 🚩listening.
He must love the 70s Reno 911
Shamazing!
I’m love this and it’s my  summer jam 2021. I can’t stop playing it.
Bad as hell
I just threw my panthies at my phone
People keep talking about Bruno Mars vocals but to be honest Anderson .Paak and Bruno Mars vocals both complement each other so well like 🌞🌛🌞🌛🌞🌛🌞🌛🌞🌛🌞🌛
this song has crack in ti
Did he say “sh’’mon over”? Lolz
its so goooood
Beautiful. Just so beautiful. No words to describe how amazing this performance is.
Ok BRUNO AND THAT BROTHER JUST MADE ME MELT!! UGGH THAT VOICE! 😌 I JUST CANT WITH THESE TWO! 🤗😘 Love anything Bruno puts out!! Just love these two!!
Now I need Silk Sonic to drop a whole album. Quit playing with the people!😂😂 LBVS
There's hope. I especially appreciate Bruno. But Paak's been on the radar.  I'm sold. Love the suits and the dance moves. Old school for sure.
Can this be put on apple music please???
Just go ahead and give them the Grammys. Like, all of them.
My brother helped make this video for the Grammys. Nice!
Show the new school how to put it down you don't need all that vulgarity You can be a  musical word Smith .PS  I feel like a little kid again watching somebody perform on soul train or something
When they said WHO was in Silk Sonic 😫 (before I even heard the song) baby let me tell you, my mind went straight 🤔 Gorilla-Suede (that will go over a few heads) and it was at that very moment I knew I was Not prepared. At All. Timeless. Effortless. Classy.Sexy.GROWN. please also release on vinyl!
So passionate and sexy!  Their voices, their movements!  Wow!  Everything on point!  This type of romance needs to come back in music!  Bravo!!!!
played it for the 19283th time today.
So good!
😍😍😍
This song is too smooth
Sounds like a string of awards coming for this one . What's next ?
woah i got chilllssss
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I can’t wait for their new album to come out
Is this ok boy from the Colbert report?
Dear Anderson  .Paak, I'm so thankful I've gotten to know your music.  You are exactly what we all needed and wanted. You and Bruno together are just magical and dreamy tones and musicality
I love this song The two of them together are awesome👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽🔥🔥🥰🥰
Silk Sonic should have received a Grammy award soon after that performance.
Now this is a group.  They all got equal parts & they sound different.  This song is bangin.  B Mars is himself & doesn't conform to what everyone else is doing.
Oh man oh man
The ancient dragon informally frame because trail accidentally compare plus a astonishing craftsman. heavenly heavy hellish, soft stopsign
Even I am chinese,I must said Bruno Mars is amazing ! What a v Incredible voice !
My whole life has become bouncing back-and-forth from this video to the official video and watching all the reaction videos. I can't get enough of this song!
Why was I biting my lip the whole performance? Damn.
They are so very good even the lights dance to their music. Very cool!
Throwback style, I LOVE it!!
This was one of the most beautiful, theatric vocal performances I’ve ever seen! I’ve done my fair share of acting over the years and I’m blown away 🥺😍
Man they took it back Spectacular OLE SCHOOL FEEL   BRAVO
FUCK YESSSS
THERES A REASON THEY GOT 30 MILLION SUBS REAL MUSIC STANDS THE TEST OF TIME
Too bad I can't hit that like button more than once.  Just amazing.
Oh well, those quick pelvic thrusts kicked all impure thoughts into overdrive 😲🤫. And am I the only one, or does anybody else wish they had a "reason" to play this song in the background 🤔?!
Bruno get  the best of people when he comes out with new songs this man is awesome and very talented !!💯👌🏽
😍😍😍😍😍😍
only performance i liked. decent. Mars can sing
The sophisticated bibliography concretely stretch because apple luckily promise from a wiggly milk. hoc, actually key
When the background dances snap and the stars light up 😍😍😍😍😍
I see the see dababy for a ft in this song
This gave me chills!
Need more music like this 😌🎶🎶🎶🎶
I can’t get enough of this song. it’s absolutely AMAZING
Love when musicians tap into the 70s style and groove
I LOVE THIS MAN AND HIS  MUSIC CREATIVE IDEAS IS TIMELESS..... YOU ARE SO TALENTED.... MODERN MICHAEL JACKSON
Wow!! This is 🔥🔥🔥!!!
the fact that this performance almost didn't happen, and it was the best one here  ( besides queen Taylor ) is crazy!!! I watch this everyday 🥵💗💗
#AIR
Man they killed this...
If they don't hurry up and make an album...
The poor shark spectacularly jog because format cytomorphologically divide before a shrill cancer. brainy, free spot
We’ll see you Bruno in few years again! Lol
Bruno always kills it at the Grammys.
The best! I can’t take this one off of repeat! 😘😘😘😘
🔥FYAH🔥
SHUT YO TRRAAPP!!!
Question........ do they sing live or pre recorded?! They voice is so smooth
Who is the Andersons guy?! He sounds like Bruno but Bruno sounds a little stronger than soft!! I love how thwy allowing each other to shin in front going mic and  back
I LOVE this song, it's been stuck in my head all week lol!! I get alittle Delfonics-style, Soul Train intro graphics to it and yes, Bruno was good but MR. Anderson brought his own flavor to it and he needs to be recognized as much as Bruno, they BOTH brought their own style!! LORD the music of today is s**t compared to music back in the day and it's not only my opinion!!🤗🙏🏼
charlie zelenoff
I love everything about this
Dislikes??? Wow...1,200 people got the door shut in their faces! 🤔😂Too bad so sad for y'all! Great song! Love it! 🥰🥰🥰❤❤❤
Absolutely Beautiful Performance😘
Thanks to Bruno Mars and Anderson for keeping music Alive!! Bruno never fails to deliver! We all know this but can we take a second to appreciate Anderson Paak??! The man reminded me a lot of David Ruffin for some reason and Idk why!! 💯
Omg, made my day! This is the pure definition of the phrase “crazy as f—k!” Thank you boys!
At 2:24 when Bruno did that “Ooo Ooo” sounded EXACTLY like Michael Jackson.
Bruno is like King Midas.. whatever he touches it turns into gold! Whatever he wears makes it trend...he is a natural!
This that grown man grown woman type of music
Now that’s singing👍🏽You did it again Bruno
HOT
Classic Bruno. Nice to have you back. WOO
Who else thought he was about to sing treasure
Sounds like Switch without the cocaine. Dope.
So good. Soooo smooth
Love Bruno! What a talented group of guys
I'm gonna get someone pregnant to this shit!
I smiled all the way through this performance
❤😊
Smooth groove!! Real singing without auto tune....brothers really singing!!!!
Silk Sonic ~ Funk Soul Brothers Millennial Edition!!!😎
I like the choreography everything about it, This Song should go PLATINUM💯❤🤎🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶
Outstanding performance!
U can see the way Bruno held the mic when He belted those high notes even for the tenor :O I guess people didnt notice how great his singing skill and a great technician singing he has, Did he ever tour? If He were, His songs are kinda tired to be sung lol
LOVE THIS GIVE THE OLD SCHOOL VIBE LOVE SONGS.  ITS WHAT MISSING IN TODAY'S MUSIC WORLD!!
Whose watch this video more than once?
"If you're hungry, girl I got the Lays" FINALLY a man who GETS me
Wow just wow 🥺💖
fake as fuck. pretty weak
The number of times I’ve replayed this is beyond the number of views.   THIS SONG IS BEYOND AMAZING.
Damn.
Thank God .the old days are back ...love it
The Weeknd should join this group
Hopefully Bruno is back!! ❤️
ive never heard this song. lemme see what this about.  edit: PFFT- MY NEW FAVORITE THING. I GOT CHILLS
Song of the year!!!  All ready lol..Take a bow fellas 👏!!!  YES SIRRRR!!!
last note gave me the chills
I’m speechless. I’m going to tell my kids “you don’t know nothing bout this” 😂
the realist music in 20²1
Love it. But performance of Grammy night
This is the collab I never thought I needed so badly but I am oh so so so so happy that it is here. These two here...Whew chile!!! I cannot WAIT to get the album.
So good, rarely do we hear anything this perfect in this generation...
3:03 to 3:30 is insane. the way he landed that last part is insane. he pulled that run from god himself
Wow!!! What a great performance!!!
Silk Sonic....they did that!!!!!!!
Magical
They sound so similiar too me...Anderson more smooth Bruno more power put them together 🔥
These Cats need multiple albums! Insane! They would friggin kill it!
Live, dead, resurrected... it don't matter cause these two cats laid it DOWN on this cut!  Hell yeah, I'm old school 4 life and Bruno Mars & Anderson .Paak royally deserves all the kudos they've received from the "ol skool nation".  We know REAL singing/music when we hear it, and this is an excellent example of it!
This is what I been missing from music!
They just casually bringin Mo Town back in 2021 and make it sound like the hardest ballad I've ever heard. Crazy talent!!!
I just had two babies watching this...
A fitting nod to the old school crooners & steppers! 👍👋💯
Way to hold last note strong! Great ending! I really enjoyed your performance. If you love entertaining, keep at it! You're Angels.
Can't wait for a concert......I would buy tickets without hearing the entire album.
THIS SONG! They did wonderfully! Bruno strong as always! GOOSEBUMPS AT THE END!
Just take out “shut your trap” 🤔
YouTube engineers:  We should create a repeat button
An awesome performance
Omg yeeeees!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️love it!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Ready for the album!!!
I'm soooo stuck on this song grown folk music
I want Anderson .Paak's glasses, where can I get them?
Ladies and gentlemen, Bruno Mars and Dave Chapelle, as Silk Sonic. 😂🤣
this is some legendary stuff  proud to be filipino btw :)
bout to convert this to a mp3 this is too good
I love this song
Raised on all kinds of music. When I first heard this song, my heart sank bcuz it brought back so many memories of 70s music. Each time I hear it, I feel so touched bcuz this is the type of music I still love and listen to.
Magic💢💢💢💢
this is so so good DAMN
Smooth performance
So are y’all haters gonna to call this performance lip-synced too?
“Shut yo’ trap!” Always makes me laugh
YAAAAS! YAAAAS! YAAAASSS! I'm gonna rock this jam before Ramadan comes!
I almost thought this was a skit. 😂 but I guess not. It was still good.
All I can say is... nothing I'm speechless
Bruno is def pimpin' ..love this ...true talent!
I have to confess... I have been addicted to this song since Grammy night 😩
This is my JAM💃🏼🔥💯
bruno mars is the reason why im glad that I was born in this generation
Loooove THIS!!! Old school feel
I love they put the old school vibe to this. This is what we need! A true ballad.
the whole shoot reminded me of treasure by my baby bruno 🥺
I hear this song all night in my head, whyyyyy!!!!! It’s so beautiful!
Shomon,
AMAZING
@ 4:09   GO DAMRCUS, GO DAMARCUS lololol
It's Bruno's Finger snap for me at the beginning
SHOMON man!! Bruno sang it even better LIVE 🤯🤯🤯🤯🔥🔥🔥🔥
Love love love is in the air 🎶❤💕
Takes me totally me back to the Philly Sound 70s. Who agrees there is nothing like Old R n B/Soul, the steps and all. I even heard a New Birth/Leslie Wilson sounding woo woo hooo at 4.12
Bruno once again proves he wanted to be a Jackson.  :-)
Bruno & Paak each have such killer bands. It'll be interesting to see how the bands mesh in a live performance.  I can hardly wait for the live tour that I'm sure will come!
Non stop listening - this song is FIRE.  Another culture changing tune from Bruno
i- fuck... okay
Bruno’s voice is out of this world! ❤️
This is vibesssss😭giving me old school vibes
Why does a great song need to be ruined by having to see Trevor Noah at the beginning?
Bring it back. Man bands boy!
Wow.... I’m feeling like those women who are in the front row just gushing over their voices and dance moves . So sexy wow... I loved this. 😍😍😍
Love 💕
The camera work is outstanding!!
That was beautiful ❤️
YES! WE NEEDED THIS 🙏
Like the old folks used to say, that's real music right there.
I just love your sound. Reminds me of all the great R&B songs from the late 60s and 70s. Keep making these beautiful songs
I love everything about this ✌🏽
70's vibe 💜 great performance.
I’ma leave the door Happpeeennnnnnn🎼🎼🎼🎼
There is no doubting Bruno's talent, but he is also a true professional.  Artists at Bruno's level oftend create a bunch of garbage when they collaborate with other artists. Examples of that are anything by Michael Jackson and Paul McCartney, and the Mars, Sheehan, Stapleton suprisingly bad song, "Blow". Usually, when Bruno collaborates with other artists it works out really well, like this duet. It just reminds us to be grateful of the era Bruno grew up in, his early origins in the family band, and his genuine appreciation classic soul music. His voice and Paak's sound great together. I'm glad, I stumbled on this video.
This duo makes COMPLETE sense! Love Bruno and Love Anderson....why didnt I think of this sooner!
First GREAT song in a long time!!! So talented and I LOVE the vintage style!!! ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
They need to remake Switch’s “There’ll never Be”.... well any of there songs actually... Even Debarges
This performance is legendary already. This song is soo fire man.... we been needing music like this for years man. Salute to these to and mannnn they better drop an album together.
Loving this so sweet & sexy🎵💃🎶💯🔥🔥🔥👑💜👑💜👑💜👑💜
Jesus is the way, The Truth and the Life! The time is now to turn from your sins and your fleshly desires and Turn to Jesus Christ, To live a life with meaning and purpose. God doesn’t want ANYONE to perish, he loves you and wants to save you! Jesus can help you Change from your old ways. We’ve ALL sinned and fallen short of the glory of God! We all deserve hell, but thankfully God made a way for us sinners to come to repentance and be saved. As we know the wages of sin is death (hell). But the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ Our Lord. Jesus is the ONLY way to the father in heaven!  We are only saved through Jesus Christ!  - John 14:6 King James Version 6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. - There is absolutely nothing we or anyone can do to save themselves we aren’t saved by works,We are saved by Grace through faith alone!  God loves the sinner hates the sin, remember we can love one another WITHOUT supporting or encouraging their sins. So with this all being said if you haven’t already Give Jesus Christ your life Today! He WANTS to spend eternity with you in heaven!! We MUST be Born again to even inherit the kingdom of heaven  - John 3:3 King James Version 3 Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. - He thinks about you all the time and loves you! He truly wants to spend eternity with you in heaven! God loves you! There is absolutely NOTHING that can ever separate God’s love and mercy for you! Pick up your Cross, and Follow Jesus! Ask for forgiveness! Time is running out! Jesus is coming soon one day no one knows the hour or day but the father in heaven. Keep praying and seeking The Lord!  Pray without ceasing! And no matter what choose Faith over fear! You are NOT alone! God said “I will never leave nor forsaken you “  He is a promise keeper!  Jesus loves YOU, have an amazing day! 🙂💗 Pls read (Proverbs 28:13)
That was so hot!!! Loved seeing these guy!
This song is legend! It’s like love at the first sight when I first listened to it. The live version is just even better, so dreamy. I’m sure they’re going to play this song every where now until decades later. Legend!
I think that Bruno Mars secretly wanted to be in a group and probably feel like he’s from the wrong era. 😇He is incredibly talented and creative! These guys are Awesome yo! I love this🎼🎤❤️ 🌷💚
this FUCKS
This was the act, LIKED BEST!!! I was JUST thinkn, "Where is Bruno?"..I heard for the first time in MY car, I was like, "WHO IS THIS?"..
Bruno back let's go
Flawless
This shit is amazing. The structure of that song is on a whole other level! And it keeps the groove the entire time. The vocals and drums are siiiiiiick! But it’s that arrangement for me!
📢They should have gotten a 👍 AWARD...BEST BEST PERFORMANCE. And So 💯EXCELLENT👁
Oh shit. I missed the Grammy's.  Thanks for this YouTube!  This was straight old school smooth.  Bruno Mars got that old music soul.  Thank God for that!  Anderson Paak.  What!  I hear you blowing and rapping.  Took me by surprise, I must say lol.  Great job guys.  Took me back to the great groups in the 70's.  Keep it coming.  We desperately need more music like this.
That is a perfect combination of 70s and 80s soul and R&B. I little too spot on. 🤭
I read a couple of commenters who said Bruno was lip syncing.  If anyone thinks that an artist with Bruno's vocal ability needs to lip synch, they should listen to his Little Richard tribute done on the same night at the Grammys.  I've been to his live concerts & he sounds better in person.
WOW I LOVE IT🌹🍹💙😘AWESOME JOB
This is everything to me 🥰😍💖
A VERY VERY VERY Special Someone Sent This To Me, all I can say & do is.......mmm mmm mmm😊 & and prepare to walk through the door❤️
DOPEEE
TRUE playa performances like this will never play out.....
They truly care about music! Bringing this old skool music  back to life! I loved it all, clothing, sound and dance steps!
3:45 till the end gets me weak in the knees
They kill this song every time they perform it❤️ Bruno is a beast and whatever song he’s on is it’s gonna be definite 🔥
Finally!!!! Thank you for a great song...🔥
we need more old school music like this on the radio! great music!!!
I didn’t know that I needed this collab 🥰💐❣️
Bruno is one of the only new school artists that I listen to today, maybe, because Bruno has an old soul. Most of this new stuff is garbage.
sweets from my coming to America voice "Dem boyz good' lol.
They can't have it both ways - if they're going to pretend like their somehow held down and victims of hate, then they can't also express or feel what it's like to win Grammy awards. They literally are doing BOTH but BOTH can't exsiat together because one cancels out the other! So THEY NEED TO STOP PRETENDING THEIR VICTIMS OF BEING LESS THAN THE AVERAGE PERSON!!
This version tho
Classic
There voices are just so beautiful 🤩
Love these two together. 😊
This joint is FIRE🔥🔥🔥🔥 I've missed music like this 💕
This is why Bruno is the GOAT right now, he actually SINGS real music.
The sound of good music to my ears 😍
We wanted tht old school feel back an this is it!!! Get ready for the next wave of baby boomers if music like this keep comin out
iono even know what to say
Love it 💕
❤🖤💚
They should've gotten Brooke Payne to choreograph this video for a more polished look. They only have 2 moves.
that " woowowowooowowowoowoooo" at the end reminds me of that go DaMarcus meme.
Very good
That spin tho ... ok yall!!! Soft and smooth
Legit watched this like 50x already. So damn SMOOTH.
I love the old skool feel of this song
Loving the old school vibe, suits, choreography, and of course, the impeccable singing!
Old school flow. Love it!
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Simply beautiful & romantic ...❤️
This version is better lol
This is sooooo good, great old school sounds and words we can all understand! Thank you, very talented good looking young men. Stay Strong, and Keep God First in your lives, he'll never let you fail. Aman ♥️
They look like a 70 s group
Now I get why Cardi B wanted to have sex on stage - she knew if she didn't have the most controversial performance ever done everyone would be talking about this performance over hers, which was 100000x better...
That's the 70s groove. I love it. Yes music final
I literally had an eargasm.
Baby making song right here! I love this song!
I love the SILK SONIC groove. Both artist voices blend beautifully! Can't wait to see them in CONCERT!!
Feels good.
Oh I love this song so much
This is classy it is time for clean music
That’s how u know there performance was great cuz no one was talking about The Weeknd being the host
Wow. So talented!!
Bruno is gonna leave the door open, but I am locking it behind me!!
I love this song and performance  Reminds me of my days in the 70s It’s fantastic  The lyrics are so funny but great
Everyone's so dehydrated and starved for outstanding modern music, when we get this gem that just fell out of the sky, nobody knows how to act. XD
I wonder if anyone said “ain’t nobody coming to see you Otitis! 😂 and I’m David Ruffin and they are the temptations 😂
This is the kind of music I miss....today’s musicians need to listen and take notes!
DDDAAAAAAAAYUMM! so good :) Just took a time machine
I love how they took it old school! Smooth. I love this song
I like this version better then the music video
🥰🥰👏🏽👏🏽🔥🔥🔥
That was hot 🔥 amazing live performance 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽💘 better than the studio recording 💯 they were enjoying themselves, singing their azzez off and all while making it look so effortless. Silk Sonic... Thank you for taking us all back to where it began. Looking forward to hearing more 💖
Love. Love. Love your gift! Amazing range. I was transcended back to the glorious days of Motown! Thank you for sharing!
The background singers look like French Montana and Gucci 😂
Love this song so much ❤️
Cold chicken and beer with some company and this song. Oooh
I’m literally obsessed with this song🥰
This song I will never get tired of it I love it to much.
This is my first time hearing this song and I'm loving it! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐🎶🎵
THAT TRANSITION MOVE AT 00:58 THO
Stylistics, the pips, harold Melvin and the blue notes, etc...hmmmmmmmmm
Real music unlike that trash with 2 women in a bed that is straight garbage🤣😂
Man I love this!! Such a VIBE!
Love the old school “ Temptations” vibes!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
They remind me of the Stylistics and the Delfonics. We need more music like this.
oh my god
I’m getting that smokey Robinson vibe from Anderson
Loving THIS
This is RB we need more song like this it take me back win my dad come comes home after a  long day at work and I remember you used to come in the living room and play Al Green sit in the couch I never understand until now music takes you away to a relaxing state of mind and have PTSD and depression and music like this help me go through the day thank you Bruno Mars I liked his voice  grenade I definitely like this voice Harlem concert
New boyz2men
I swear for a second I thought trevor Noah was Bruno Mars.
This shit is hot!!! 💯
Skip to start 0:15 AND EF WHOEVER IS FORCING PEOPLE TO LISTEN TO THE INTRO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Everything about this song is great. And Bruno Mars is in a league of his own
The duo we didn’t know we needed.
Why is Bruno lip syncing?
Bruno is 1 artist i always say, has never made a bad song.
Fist pump the tailor.  Those outfits are so precise.  The precision of the moves cannot go unmentioned.  Everyone on point.
I recently posted my own cover of Bruno's "When I Was Your Man". Would love to have you check it out!
Out of this world performance! I loved everything about it! 🙌🏽🙌🏽 Real Music!
This was a phenomenal performance!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👑👑👑👑👑👑👑
Wow! Amazing performance. Both voices are somehow better live!
Bravo excellent Bruno nice to see your back you are the star of the show
70’s Reboot ♥️♥️
Omggg I love this 😌😍😍 soul train vibes
I’ve been waiting for this collab... smooth and grown!!!!
It's the I'm going to leave the door open for me😩how effortless Bruno Mars sang it
Still friggen awesome as ever!
I haven’t been this crazy about a group since boy bands back in the day!❤️❤️ I’m obsessed with them!
This is what's been missing - Love it!
These dudes are freaking awesome.
YES!!!! Please keep making music like this!!
really silky
Bruno Mars is a the most talented performer.  We need more music with him in it💗💗💗!
This is just pure greatness!! So fucking legend! I was just smiling the entire time watching this
The performance made me smile the whole time!! These two together...I can’t!!
Yeppppppp I’m listening to this everyday for the rest of my life, I’m getting the best of both worlds on one stage 💯💯🔥🔥🔥🔥
I love Anderson
Just to smooth. I love it. The video is better
Man stop playing with us and give us a Silk Sonic album!!!
I thought the line was "If you're hungry, I've got the Lays." Which I was like, aite, that's pretty good, I'll come on over. Turns out, it's "I've got FILETS." EVEN BETTER.
Watch this vid with 240p bringing back true vibe
Got that old school  sound.Love it Bruno bringing RnB back.
Love it. Bruno giving Sammy Davis vibe!! Thank you for bringing back this smooth type 🎶.  You all sound great!!
The hissing sofa dfly bow because kevin inherently snow before a level ocelot. hideous high, impartial dill
What we needed in 2021!!
No autotune=100000/10
🥰😍
This performance is classic
Yo...watch it once...then watch it the 2nd time and just keep your eyes on the dance steps in the back...it's fricken tight!
They both killed it though 🔥🔥🔥💯🥵🥵🥵
I just love me some Bruno Mars 😩🔥🔥💙👏🏽👏🏽
the only thing that i don't like about this song... it only lasted for 4mins long.  I NEEEED MORE (╬ಠ益ಠ)
This song is marvelous. I try to take down this cover, but what I sang like a ghost. Bruno, you are really bad bad.
Thank you
Make it available to Philippines please. 😁
“If you’re hungry I got filets” LOL
Too sexy for your own good...
hairy coochie music
This song make you feel like just let them sing because you can’t.
Great performance all the way around 🌟❤💫❤💫❤💫💃🏽🌹💋
Great music  Taking me back to the Greuze of the 70s.
GROWN MEN ENERGY FOR SURE!❤😫😍
Amazing!
im getting michael jackson vibes and its quite pleasant lol
Oh damn... this is good ! 🙌🏻
This retro vibe.....I’m feeling it
Now this is real music!! Total Motown Vibe!! It's so smmooooth!! Not disrespectful to a woman. Not calling a woman out her name or sexualizing her, just makes a woman feel good, loved, and respected. And its the JAM! You can dance yo butt off to this!! Keep it coming! We need more music like this!!
The Delfonics "Didn't I" + Bloodstone "Natural High" =
So this is what we needed after this last year and a half. Some good old fashioned babymakin' music of the _highest_ caliber. Good shit.
This is what real talent looks like! This is what other artists these days are lacking. Best performance of the night in my opinion! Love me some Bruno 😍
There's going to be more talent coming out of Hawaii hopefully they can be successful like Bruno . He has a special kind of talent it's called hard work and never give up
THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT VIDEO ON THE INTERNET RIGHT NOW  CAN I GET A HELLL YEAHHHHHHH!!!!!
Who is the guy singing the verses?
I love the OG and this is somehow better. Literally eating this up! One of my favorite parts is when Anderson is singing “I got that haze” and some words before. You can see he is having fun and playing with this song! Sooo good! Flabbergasted to the fullest extent. I look forward to their album.
This song has crack in it I swear
This is BETTER than the studio version. Unbelievable! Immaculate!
We were leaving the door open for this....😘🥰🥰🥰
NO!!! Not trading bk or lockette.
Shuuuuurrrrrr guys, let's just ignore Bruno's package that he definitely didn't stuff
the ending gives me the chills....... awesome song!!!!!
NICE
Magical DUO !
anderson paak is amazing
Bruno look good as hell with a mustache! Silk Sonic is wonderful.
the lyrics are hilarious its almost an SNL skit of someone pretending to be bruno with some guy who looks like Dave Chappell  seriously they could get dave to play Anderson Paak. and i bet it would be just like this!    on a side note this is awesome the 70's suits definitely part of the joke but ofc they look good in them!
Is it just me or does it seem like Paak is actually singing but Mars is lip-syncing?
That Anderson Paak is one sexy man when he is singing.
Maaannnnn...wtf did I just witness?? This is simply amazing. Also what real music is supposed to sound and feel like.
the heart glasses tho
♥️💥♥️💥♥️💥♥️💥♥️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
LALALALALALALA THANK YOU BABY FOR THIS AMAZING SONG AND PERFORMANCE
AMAZING
I left my door open once and I got robbed.
Tells how much Temptations, Four Tops et al meant
Yakuza like a dragon lookin strange
Brings you back to the seventies  classics, with the Stylistics, Blue Magic, The Del Fonics and The Moments who were groov'n.  Thanks for giving us the nostalgic magic from that era of music with this song.  Peace and God bless.
This is a dope ass song! Bruno Mars is continuing to cement his name in music history! Dude is dope!!
"'DAMN"' 👏👏👏
can we talk about bruno’s vocals??????? and how he ate???!!!!!??! LIKE EXCUSE ME!?!
🤰🏽me preggers with Silk Sonic Jr
🥰💕💕💕💕 so smooth
I like filets.... Filet o Fish
Luv this song. Glad you're back Bruno.
This jam is my new sh*t. I listen to it continuously
I dont think its good to tell people you door is open
I'm telling y'all Bruno Mars is the closest this generation will ever get to a Michael Jackson or Prince.  He's the next Icon!
This performance was incredible. It is nice that we see real r&b performed. These two gentlemen sang everybody under a table.
I’m so here for this whole vibe. This whole 70s vibe is giving me joyyyyy
god damn
This was soooooooooooooooooo dope!!!
omg the vocals
He has to be black...
Aye good music brothers 🐺🍾
the announcer is a big Weeknd fan i see
Now this is what you call real music unlike Cadi B. WAP, obsolete garbage music. R.I.P mumble rappers / autotuned wannabe singers.
Bruno, Silk Sonic...are you sure you weren't born in the 70s? You have the swag on lock. It seems to permeate your soul.🤭
This group of young men and their harmonious vocals are absolutely beautiful! HOWEVER,,,, Bruno Mars never disappoints! Exceptionally talented and he continues to show us what true music is!  🎶  🎼
Bruno Welcome Back you have been missed
Wow amazing 🎙🎶🎵🎼🎼🎤👑👑🥰🥰🥰💓💓💓🤗🤗🤗🤗🙏🙏🙏🙏
Dang these 2 are amazing. Miles better than Cardi B.
My inner 13 yr old self is falling in love all over again with Bruno Mars
Love everything about this song and video.♥️♥️♥️ Have watched it and listened to it over and over. Awesome job guys!👍👍💪💪♥️
PERFECTION
Wow loving this  replaying this

ANDERSON!! WoW! They are very, very good together! This was fantastic!
Wow I didn’t know Dave Chapelle could sing
Omg!!! This song is something seriously amazing!!! 😍
BRUNO TE AMO
As someone who grew up in the 70's this👇🏾made my WHOLE night and I enjoy it with every fiber of my BEing...🎙🎶🕺🏾  Old school crooning, coordinated dance moves and 3-piece leisure suits...these young girls don't know what it's like to be courted...😛  I'm so glad these two talented men decided to collaborate as Silk Sonic...the lyrics are hilarious though...I'm a guy's girl so the nuances in this song tickles me and a wink to the old skool eloquently asking a girl for some 😂🤣 This makes me miss basement house parties where we used to slow dance and grind🤣😂  I can't stop listening to it...the live performance sounds even better than their recording...💯  This👇🏾is how to #ElevatetheGood with FUN and MUSIC! 🎶💃🏾  Thank y'all!!🤎  #andersonpaak  #brunomars  #SilkSonic  #leavethedooropen  #GrammyAwards2021
Old school sound. Nice.
This is one of the absolute best things created by our species
I loveee this songgg ❤️❤️
Awesome
Beautiful
This is the S—t!!! Omg ❤️❤️🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
Love this! Brings you back to the 60-70s when times were so simple.
BRUNOOOOOOOOOO! How dare you come out the WOOD WORKS with EXCELLENCE!! How dare you leave us alone and come out when you feel like it?! This was a hit!
Anderson reminds me of Chapelle in his old skits on comedy central lmao.
This is nice
I absolutely love Bruno Mars. He's so soulful and not to mention that he's a very handsome young man. My granny likes him too!!😁
I love Bruno Mars !
Can you dig it?!
Wow, this is quite a performance, music and melody. Awesome
“Shut yo trap”😌😫
Yes glasses
This song is hot smooth
This is Classic 70 sound Love ❤️ Romance  Lyrical Poetry Man ... Melody!! I have listened and watched this video soo many times!! Love this sound !
This is so refreshing. Love to hear that there’s still people who make music LIKE THIS❤️ perfect!
These two together is magic
I just went dead and blind....thank you Bruno and Andersen Paak
Is this for real? Almost seems like a parody😂
Exceptional in every way!
IM OBSESSED.. SOMEONE STOP ME FROM REPLAYING THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN
Thank God! I needed some new Bruno in my life!
You 1.2K that thumbed this down, I hope you have nightmares!!!!
Goodness, this was FABULOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!
Live>Studio
This is one of the best things that has happened to us in the past 2 years.
Supa grooooooovy♡💖💗💫☆💕
Thy remind  me of Force MD's in my days! Another classic! They don't make music like this! Way to go Bruno!!!
Can we just go ahead and get a presale. We ready to get them that Diamond plaque before we even get a release date cus ...😍🔥PERFECTION!!!👏🏾😩
Bobby and El Debarge
I am addicted to this song 😍😍
Master performance how does this not have way more views
2:26 KILLS MEE😫
Ayee
Anderson is a great musician.  I been listening to his music for years. I recommend to everyone to listen to his pass three albums.  This album with Bruno is highly anticipated.
0:54 that smooth spent tho
I can't stop listening to this song
🔥🔥🔥
I absolutely love this. Bruno you put your heart in this. You go boy!
Best song and performance on the Grammys
I love that Bruno is all about the old skool vibe!! Damn I can’t get enough of him/them/this!!!
They should come to the Apollo Theatre
The 70’s vibe is fire
The spin.....
Disssss One Bad Song. Bruno @ it again. Ohhhhhh God
The Hook on this song, The Hook on this song is❤❤❤
YAAAAASSSSSSSS 😍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
0:47 Paaks move was so simple but so clean at the same time
Prefection this group will be selling out tours. Would love to see them live.
This is a beautiful song
So love the 70s vibe...
No one can beat Bruno Mars and Anderson.paak’s voice literally it’s insane how they are not even using lipsinc or nothing and they sing that well.
Sensuous, seductive, mesmerizing- I'm here for allit: smooth vocals, fancy fantastic footwork and perfect sentiment for 2021: Leave your door open; new experiences, people, feelings. In the words of Marvin Gaye "come and get to this."  oh, can i pay for my concert ticket now?
The ripe trouble gratifyingly launch because baseball positionally attempt failing a panicky invention. confused, harsh sweatshop
this was the best performance at the grammys 😌🤍
I’m old school, I grew up with music from the 60’s, 70’s, and 80’s R&B music and this tune right here can hold a candle to all of it. This track with Paak and Mars on it is str8 🔥
so fireeee !!!!
I swear I come here a couple times a day to see this. Just...perfection ! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Sounds like 70-80s with class .. love it !!
2 types of men.. filet/lays 😂
Am I the only one that likes the live better????!
The back drop reminds me of the ceiling of a Rolls Royce, I feel so rich experiencing this honey smooth top tier quality performance.
Bruno reminds me of a young Michael Jackson
Bruno Mars always delivers .
I swear Anderson .Paak is so underrated. I feel like Bruno brings the powerful vocals and Anderson brings the flavor.
The vibes are immaculate
Excellent! Yes!!👍♥️
Bruno mars is like a beautiful peacock 🦚 that blesses us with his feathery silky voice every so often..so sit back and don't scare that beautiful man🥰💞💞
This performance was so adorable
When I read they were going to make an album together, I knew they wouldn't disappoint! Two great artists, can't wait to hear more.
This was the ONLY reason to watch the Grammys!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Pure Music at it's finest.. We need more of this.. R&B... Plain n simple
😩😩 I feel like a sixteen year old girl at a conceerrrttttt 😍😍😍
Pants not tight enough but everything else is on point. Esp Bruno's moustache 😂
Great video! :-)
I've listened to this song so many times I lost count because it's a beautiful song  I wish my husband was still here we be dancing because he loved love song's .Looking forward to hear more beautiful songs from these guys I believe this is just the beginning .They are so talented .
This single and upcoming album is a recipe for multiple grammy nominations for 2022.

Damn they bringing that old school rnb back I'm loving this
I like the song already and the vibe. Now I’m going to make a Silk Sonic shirt as soon as possible because of this performance. Anderson Paak sang that. Bruno was exquisite as always.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Whew, they did THAT
Omg is it me but I cat stop watching them ❤️😘🔥🔥
That's boost the population music.
This is just one of those songs that is better live.

I was growing up during the 70s and this song really hit the mark of that era of tunes. I'll be buying the album.
After 45 years of being overshadowed by hip hop, Black soul music is BACK!!!! Right on!
Anderson Paak is underrated!!! Give this man some credit!!!🔥🔥🔥😍❤️❤️❤️
This joint straight musical crack You be like,  kay. Just one mo time....
I can’t get over this performance. It’s so good. 😩
Bruno learned a lot from Prince bring everyone with you it makes them better 💜
Damnnnn always been suckah for a good guy group from back in the day! I was definitely born in the wrong time but thanks to these guys at least we get some of the magic back during these times 🥰🎶
Bruno Mars can sing anything to me
That drum compression
Upload this on Brazil, pleaaaaaase.
Can't wait for this album to drop... This so smooth (I pre-ordered the collectable single)
I was watching the Grammys and when I seen this I just sat there with a smile on my face-
Wow they are so rich.
Type song makes you hate being single but also you can drive to
Am I the only one that thinks they sound the same??
THE BEST!!!!!
Rappers this is how real men talk to women..please take 📝. 😉
😍😍
Bruno could sing me right out my drawers!!!!!!!🥰🥰🥰🥰
Thank u Anderson and Bruno..now I can start listening to the radio again.❤❤
Did you notice three stars when they reach up and finger snap?
Pure fire, a lot better than the original version because of that special old school  sound 👍.  This was a great collaboration,  looking forward to hearing more from this two as a group/ band.

Now that’s what this country needs; real baby-making music...🤙🏽
Did he say Shome on over... 🤣🤣🤣
Speechless 👏👏👏👏🤎🤎🤎🔥🔥🔥🔥💯
No disrespect to other artists today, but Silk Sonic’s popularity really says something. People want music made by MUSICIANS! Artists who have honed their craft through years and years of work, and who came together who put out something truly great.
when they sing together i cry.
He don’t miss
Is it weird that I cried cause this performance was so strong??
I'd start listening to the radio again if they start making songs like this again!  If I don't hear Grammy nominations for this one,.... well, let's just say it wouldn't be "lady-like" and God wouldn't be pleased with my sentiments. *Grown folk music *THANKS FOR "BRINGING IT",  BRUNO, PAAK, SILK SONIC*
I like how genders a social construct  but yet they still let this song air but if i call someone the he that aint a he   im a transphobe. Bruno what if she had a peen😚😙😗😑
It's almost impossible not to groove to this! Btw, Bruno really rocking that Filipino Uncle look 😂
Motown, bring it back
Now this is music. Beautiful music. No twerking was necessary. 😆
This performance is so 🔥! I want more!!! I NEED an album!
I stood up when he asked If you smoke🥰💁🏾‍♀️💨💨💨🔥🔥🔥💯🤸🏾‍♀️
I Cannot.
These cats are groovin, and thats no jive. Bring it back brothers.

The way Bruno changes up the “the way I want you baby” line .... WHOA
This shows how dope the "new generation" musicians making music sounds like the 50's 60's 70's...remember this is 2021!
I wonder why that isnt Flip singing next to Bruno
Bruno Mars is a performer. Anderson Paak is a performer. Dynamic duo 😩
For a quick second I was like, “wtf, Dave chapelle can sing like that?!” 😂😂😂  Awesome song better than the studio version
This was amazing 🤩 whoever gave this a thumbs down HEY YOU SUCK !! This was so gooooood to the soul
Love the suits.
Shone On
Amazing
Can’t wait for the tour 🤎🤎✨
I PRAY they keep this group going. So smooth
Not from 63rd
This song just has every ingredient
They have to put this version out it is exactly what I needed to hear at the right damn time when the weather is getting warmer
Black 70s soul all over this track... I like!!
Bruno! U and Anderson outdid yourselves! Love it!!!
Bruno sure lookin' like a young Sammy Davis Jr. here. Awesome performance by everyone!
I'm embarrassed to say The amount of times that I have listened to this performance 🤣🤣🤣 I love it
They both sound INCREDIBLE
Such a beautiful song 🎵
Love this song. It took me back to good RB. Great !!!
Oooopppennnnnnn ...sessy delivery
This song would've been a greater song sung by Michael Jackson if he was still alive!
😍😍😍😍😍
This shit fire!!!!
This that funk 💗💗💗💗🤤
They need the OJ's on thd remix. Thst would be 🔥
The dudes who are listening to this EPIC  jam about having clean houses, doobies, fine cuts of meat, warm pools, sung by men in 70's leisure suits, magic glitter sprinkles in the air, with Bootsy glasses, silky soul, and inviting ladies over for good lovin' are tomorrow's daddies. Bruno and Anderson saved the human race with one song.
Rael a** harmony !!! So far my song of the month 😌💗💗💗
Yesssssss
Old school smooth!!!
Sip sip Drip drip 😂😂😂😭
This is straight fire
💖💖💖
Had to come to this video via VPN. smh
13k comments and I c a baby boomer generation being created while enjoying   this new sensational season of chills and goosebumps. This performance is LIT 🕺🎤🎶🕺🎤🎶💃💃💃👼👑🤰💎😁😽 The mating ritual has begun. 💚🕊🐝🌹💜
An Awesome Performance!❤
Both their voices goes together so well it's crazy
Y’all better sang not sing!!!!!
This shit so good thank you so much for this best feeling i have had in a long time listening to music
I could listen to this song all day, takes me back , to my childhood in the 70s Wow! Remind me of the Temptation. Keep it up! My Brothers
Now that’s a cool ass performance!
🔥 old school R and B.....
They killed this song
I loved the song and group...he is definitely taking me back when groups could SING..🥰💕
💖💖💖💖💖💖 I missed him!!!! My daughter and I talked him up.  Love their courage to pay homage to the 70's, music that make you feel something. Love it🥰
Instant classic
The feminist are mad as hell. I’m surprised this isn’t being canceled.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Omg this song is everything. This is real music right here. 🔥🔥
WOW!!! I real enjoyed the performance and the homeage to classic 70s R&B groups. I got "Temptations/O'Jays/Harold Melvin & Bluenotes" vibes in the performance. LOVED it!!!
Thank you for beautiful music ♥️
This is the perfect matchup two male artists that are fully talented play instruments write music... I've always loved to see how men can show their talents and music without having women in a band to Without relying on women for harmonies and whatnot...
Living proof that good music is still alive! R&b is still ALIVE!!!
Bruno Mars is my baby And Paak... I never really took him seriously as a singer and just seems like he's always joking on a track this is a first song I really felt like he shined doing things a different way
He is definitely the bridge of great music!  He is giving new life to the great music of the past with a twist I LOVE IT THANK Y'ALL SIR'S!
The vibration we need today ... GREAT MUSIC ... BRING IT BACK
Please react to SB19 new MV “WHAT “ Released March 9,2021 Thank you 🙏🏼
Im dedicating this to Theresa Caputo, the world renowned Medium O' ïsla Langa (Long Island) she'll love it.
This just reminds me how sad it is that my uncle got me tickets for Bruno’s concert in Hawaii as a graduation gift not realizing his concert would be while I was up in AZ for college 🥴 Don’t regret going to college but damnnnn I really wanted to be there 🥲
i wanted to hate but damn...i hit the like button!
Nice work! Talent, skill, a good song,  solid vocals and plenty of vibe. A+

I swear everytime I listen to this live version I see and hear angels singing 🎶.. So melodic.. So flawless
I LOOOVE THIS SONGGGGG! Both men has AMAZING vocals!!!!!! Beautiful!!!!!
People keep sleeping on AP's talent, it's ridiculous smh but soon they will see......
I know this performance will be remembered as part of the Motown classic collection for years to come. I love the feel of the Temptations, The Manhattans, The Five Heartbeats, and The Glady's Knight and the Pips groove. Such a feel-good music. Thank you Bruno Mars.
😎 😎 So happy you’re back 🎉
Imagine sounding better live than the studio recording. Magic on stage tbh
Damn  I hate when the live performance is as good or better then the recorded version...DAMN IT
This was a duo that was NEEDED!!!!! These two are so good together it’s INSANE✨
They all did great and looked good, but Bruno, the vocals, the vocals.👏👏👏
Idk which one I like more! This one live or the music video!!! They’re both just AMAZING 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Absolutely the best performance of the night without any questions!  Amazing!!
💜💜💜
This is my mf jam! Early morning house cleaning playlist vibes 😎😎😎
Amazing!
Damn if Bruno Mars was my husband ☺️
YESSSSSSSSSSSSAAAAAAAAA !!!!!
this whole time I thought he said " I got Lays..." not filet.
Amazing performance
This song is worth a grammy
Absolutely awesome video! The song is beautiful, all the vocals are incredible. The choreography moves are so cool. Great musicians and arrangement. They make it look so effortless, and a lot of hard work and talent made it happen. Just love this video/song.
0ld skool very good 👍
The 1.1 that didn't like this suck ass🙄
This sounds like a spin off to Bruno's Versace on the floor song.
Wow.... beautiful vocals that’s back in the day soul! ❤️👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾

Bruno Mars big fan I have been a big fan since i was 4 or 3 I love you music.
The unwieldy wealth periodically buzz because zebra hepatosplenomegaly peel via a overrated patio. craven, clean plane

Bruno Mars is the man! He know how to give us hits & that voice & swag & his stage presence - true talent
I like to think somewhere in this universe Michael Jackson and Prince were looking down on this and smiling like crazy....
Love 💗

Omg love Bruno Mars aesthetic and voice so glad to alive at the same time with this man HES A LEGEND
I can't believe I missed this performance and just finally saw this on YouTube!  I really luv this song!
Dammit, I just hate they pre-recorded their vocals but it was still dope.
I love this song. I love the old school vibe. I bet they were high when they wrote this and when they chose those (tight in the crotch) pants ....lol
Bruno Mars is good 😌
Legendary duo
Bruno is golden no matter what he touches 😍
This song has an "old school" vibe!  It take's me way back! (finger snapping and suits)  Loving this one👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾

What a combination?!  This song is EER-thing! Definitely on repeat! Bruno could sing “Pat-a-Cake” and make it sound award worthy.
these guys are literally a time machine <33
I have no words for this performance. ❤️
Damn,  too bad they weren't able to perform in front of a packed audience! They definately would had everyone on their feet and would have received a standing ovation!! Phenomenal song of the year!
All of the “live” versions since the pandemic hit are not live FYI.
I just want to say your performance was absolutely fantastic 👏  I loved the fact you gave us a 70"s. Feel. Niiiiiice
mini mustache
Giving me frisson from my head down to my toes. Every...single...time...

Anyone else hear Bobby Womack and the Chi Lites influences here??? As soon as I heard this I thought of them. Loving this song.
Straight fire!
Too smooth!
Can we have more music like this. Not a single cuss word mention. This is true R&B at its finest‼️, let’s bring back baby making music.
They have potential to be the best R/B group ever. Be real.......
perfection as always
Bruno will sing any girl out of her panties 😩
🥰🥰🥰
I always want Anderson to say "You got plans? Cancel that!" rather than "Don't say that!"
Damn..Bring back music like this.. Just turned 50 and tired of all this nonsense music sexualizing women.  WAP Perfomance disgusting..Shame on CBS for allowing that to be aired.
BRUNO MARS NEVER DISAPOINTS!!! STREAM THIS ON THE BIG SCREEN TV TO REALLY ENJOY...GO SOUL SONIC!!
What A Nice Performance  awesome
It’s the shut your trap for me 😂😂

Did you guys hear that Bruno Mars called the grammys and asked can they perform because there's 2 of work musicians and they like to perform in the grammy said yeah! That's what's up !!
Love love love this! Currently jamming and grooving to this in my car solo! 💕
Who’s still watching?
Fuck not fair that’s too damn good bravo
That was beautiful, how do you sound good in the studio and live❤
Imagine them being able to perform in front of their peers. They would've been straight up standing ovation no doubt probably from the first verse on
IM IN LOVE WITH THIS SONGG!!!
So dope. The new school temptations! Straight up don't forget to give the two in background their props too. Dope group
I can't stop watching this 😍
How many ladies were impregnated during Bruno's vocals?...#babymakinmuzak
Just brilliant!
The lack of ass shaking and nudity unsettles me.
Sounds like king of music MJ a little.  ❤
Soooo smooth like old school MoTown!  Love it!
Anderson and Bruno......I'm speechless   Also loved the Jackson 5 feel as well.....RIP Michael Jackson
This is the best thing to happen to me in 2021.....My heart is jumping from start to finish....song is on repeat.....mwahhhhhh thank you....needed this moment....great duet.... if my uncle Roger Troutman were alive he would loveeeeeeee Bruno.... such a talented entertainer
Is there a way to get this version on Spotify? Their live vocals hit different

I really never listened to Bruno Mars he’s really got a GREAT VOICE . OMG  Good music is very JOYOUS!!!
I'm  loving this song
How can people not like this? This real music.
If you Believe in your heart and confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ died on the cross for our sins then Resurrected three days later and is our Lord and Savior you will be saved ! He who is sinless died on the cross for our sins just so we could be here. He is the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords from generation to generation! Read your bible daily and please Repent!! God bless you and your family!💜 (Not trying to force upon anyone who does not agree )
BRUNO IS MY BOO!!!
JUST 💘 🥰😍😛
The 1000 plus people who have this song a thumbs down, are mad because Brian Mars won't do a Polka Music's Greatest Hits CD.
I think 🤔 this melody is from an old song.
Love the old r/b group look and moves!
This is pretty dope
it's like we are still listening to the recorded version. bruno mars is an amazing amazing performer. :-)
Go Breezy LoveJoy
rent was due.
He said, “schomon.” A little bit of MJ lives in most of these artists whether they give him credit or no. And we know Bruno does so, “heehee.”
It's not often that a live performance is better than the studio cut. This was flawless.
I like Bruno Mars he brings back the old town flavor even though I’m 28 my parents Raised me as an old head I guess I like a bunch of old songs
Darn, I keep coming back to play this song---I love it
what in the late 70s is this
Love this. Old school ❤️❤️❤️ make you want to slow dance 💃🏾
[Intro: Bruno Mars] Said baby, said baby, said baby  [Verse 1: Anderson .Paak & Bruno Mars] What you doin'? (What you doin'?) Where you at? (Where you at?) Oh, you got plans?

Letting these youngins know what real damn music sounds like! This is some baby making music! It used to be r Kelly's music when I was growing up that was baby making music. Now that's raping music. Jodeci was better though. Screw r Kelly! But that remix to ignition is still hot and fresh out the kitchen it still got me rolling my body got every man in here wishing. sipping on coke and rum I'm like so what I'm drunk it's the freaking weekend baby I'm about to have me some fun. Lame 😉😁😂😂😂

The enchanted fear parenthetically snatch because bow prognostically press throughout a skinny hail. pale, sincere tortellini
This was definitely a treat for the grown folk!     🔥🔥🔥🔥
So we not going to talk about Anderson's silky-smooth af spin to grab the mic stand?
This was the best performance on the Grammys so refreshing real music real talent
Genuine talents of the Grammys. The Performance
Why did i think this was a joke? I should've known with Bruno it wasn't. He's so OL'SKOOL!!! Words funny though! My sister won't stop playing this. She was baking cookies to this last night! LOL
Bruno the best singer in the world ☝️☝️☝️☝️
AMAZING! Bruno I ALWAYS expect your performances to be above and beyond the stars. You guys sound GREAT together. Anderson, LOVE YOUR VOICE! 1st time hearing you sing. Need to stop being a rapper. I don't know I lost count. I watched the grammy performance 60-80 times, maybe I should of counted the HOURS!!!
Bruno ruined the song
Nothing special here youngsters. I do appreciate the homage to the 70s though. The best part the performance is the outfits, with the wide collar shirts... I would say this, compared to a lot of the crap so-called music that was performed at the Grammys This would be one of the better performances.
Wow pure talent. Fully dressed and nothing over the top. Pure talent this is truly amazing.
NOT THE PAMPERS DIAPER Ad pLAYING BEFORE THIS VIDEO  LMFAOOOOO
I keep rewinding b4 I get to the End bcause I don't want it 2End. Sexy Smooth Seductive Mesmerizing & whatever other adjectives to describe this performance.  Leave The Door Open den with the Windows Up! It's all U
I love this🤍 Bruno always give such a good vibe😭
This shit smooth asf, album gon be 🔥
My husband who doesn't care about current pop music in general liked "I shaved - smooth like a new-born" part so much LMAO
<3
"Smooth like a newborn" ...makes me laugh out loud every time I hear it.
Bruno was swinging them hips like he knows how to throw it back ijs lol
2.9 million views and that .9 is ALL me. 💛 This song is sexy af.
Far out mon...
❤️❤️❤️❤️
So fine, with those silky smooth lyrics and  moves
this is cute
They did their thang on this one. Gotta be from the 70's to know about this. Well done fellas.👌🏾
this is the definition of a flawless performance
💓💓💓💓💓💓💓
I so love this song this group is so smooth even with Bruno Mars and I love him too ❤️❤️
YESSSSSSS, SING THAT!
Great singing! Very romantic!
why this isn't available in my country? I had to use vpn to watch
Give me Jackson 5 vibes SONG OF THE YEAR YESSSSSSS I PLAY THIS SONG A FEW TIMES A DAY
The live version is BETTER THAN THE VIDEO
Great job with the music you all really compliment each other, a little old school R&B with soul.  We need the soul songs where they reach for air again not this $h!t they play on the radio nowadays.
I love this song like omg 😍😍😫
Loooooove this!
Beautifully made collaboration if two Great Artists! They sound and work so great together! Love this Song !
Thank you Bruno and Anderson for bringing true soul back to R & B and presenting a performance that had dignity and class as sophisticated men. Your dignity and class should be passed onto 2 female performers who will do anything to bring attention to theirselves and get complaints written to the FCC.
Silk sonic sounds like the best flat iron ever!
Real RAW talent who understands MUSIC 🎶💋
How do we even recover from this? This is too good. Damn! BRAVO!
This was a brilliant combo...real music is back
The song is 🍽🔥🔥🔥, but the brown matching 70's suits with fly away collars presentation almost killed it for me ...too cheesy, needed to be a bit more subtle and not so overt 70's.
Wow Bruno Mars never fails!
Straight fire
03:53-03:55 ooooh nicely done
I want to wear those pants and I don’t even have a P&B ❤️
How was this song just released and it's already a classic?
2:36 Marvin Gaye just got chills in his grave.
drowning!
Flawless they have that  old school soul train vibe, we need something new like that
Awesome song. Brings back that old school sound and feeling.
Classic timeless music 🎵🎶 I hear a little Bee Gees and a little Switch towards the end with the la la la . All around this is so dope!
Bruno bought it back real! I love this! Thank you!
Can you say magic sound.
This song makes Snoop Doggy Dogg cry it's so emotional!
Paak came for real, and B made sure he was not left behind. These boys did the damn thang!!!!
1979 your song is calling you back
Please SHUT THE DOOR...😜😏💋
Wth is this?
That slide out transition was smooth! 🥰
They are flawless
That performance was perfection, they murdered it 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🔥🔥🔥
Motown is back!
I’m so happy it’s 2021 and Artist are still creating these timeless vibes,  Great Duo!! Silk sonic!!
Keep replaying !!! In love with this music and vibe!!!! Thank you,  Thank you 🙌🙏💕💐🙆‍♀️
When Bruno hits that note on 2:17 so clean!!!
I love that we’re in 2021 and Beautiful music like this is still being created :) !! Silk sonic what a duo!!!
Step back Anderson.  Nice try.  Bruno just shines like a star with his micro mini man self.
3/19/21 I BET I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO NOTICED THEM SAYING (SHUMONE AND BRUNO MARS SAID SHUMONE OVER) like Myyy Michael Jackson use to say😍😍🥰💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝🥰🥰😍😍😍 I ABSOLUTELY AM IN LOVE WITH THIS SONG
As amazing as that was, we just gonna pretend Anderson didn't almost crack on the note, and Bruno looking so disappointed but carried on anyway??? |TimeStamp 3:53| or just - https://youtu.be/_d4yW6Lz_1o?t=233
I love Bruno's Range BUT Anderson .Paak has SUCH a beautiful quality to his voice that is instantly recognizable and so unique, it's like his voice was made for this old school sound
the synchronized stomps & humps @ 1:25 & 1:56 respectively. Over the top... slam dunk for me dawg
I absolutely love iitt great performance
Anderson should join the Bruno group
This performance is all that matters during the Grammy’s
✨❣️😍
THIS is where it is at! ...YES to this collaboration!!!
Com onpletely agree in full! And anyone who disagrees is simply missing out on how long his career has spanned in not only music but film and stage shows with his big family, 🤯🤩. Love is coming from my home for sure!
Anybody get this vibe from thus song like when ur parents would have there music on back in the days this is that
They are the only reason r&b is still alive for the men at least
This music may not be everyone’s style but dang, you got to admire the incredible vocals and musicianship on this song!  Thumbs down? Yeah right!
Everytime I watch this, I want to like it again. Truly exceptional.
What a warm feeling… We need to bring this music back I loved it so much🥰
WELL NEEDED. IS ALL I CAN SAY. WOW, JUST WOW.
Thank you Thank you, Thank you!
2 artist that are totally underrated. Absolutely love both. Great performance!!!
Old school vibes, I've missed R&B.
I still find it incredible how they managed to make the song even better. Wow!
I can’t stop listening to it,  I love it so much
bruno mars more like bruno balls!!!!
Bruno mars one of the artist that sounds absolutely perfect singing live
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💋💋💋💋🥰🥰🥰🥰
I love this song. Bruno always delivers. It took me back to old school 80’s . Very talented young man and group. I’m looking forward to experience the whole album
I'm a big fan of Bruno Mars. He never left ..lets do Saturday Night Live. Anderson Paak you can go.. This is a Hit.. 1970 my days..
Obviously, inspired by the 1960s and   70s soul r and b bands
Please bring real music back.. this right here is just gave me hope .. Prince would love this song. Take it back to the 90s we will rock with it ..
I love Bruno Mars. He never dissapoints when he performs live! That was an awesome performance!
Well shucks! I like this version more than the original.  Bruno is a legend in the making and Anderson . Paak is that DUDE!
Bruno Mars is so talented but mannnnnnnnnn Anderson .Paak gave life to this song. His voice is so unique. No two people should have this much talent!
I need to experience this live. I’m tryna fake pass out in the front like a young 60’s jawn watching the Temptations.
The best of the Grammys. When I was watching it and they came out I was speechless. So, what can I say now: awesome, stunning, still speechless. It's a flash back to the blues and good for the new negeration to know. It's puppy love.🤗 I'ma leave the door open. Good vibes. What a Moment, Momentous, Puñitis!🎉🙏🏽🇵🇷
Keep doing what you’re doing Bruno! ❤️
I mean this kind of music already had its era though
Bell bottoms and Afros
THIS, THIS RIGHT HERE, TAKES ME BACK!!!!! To a time in my life when music made you feel about life, love, and relationships.
Why are they all lip synching ??:also why am I the only one in this chat that's notices???🤦🏾‍♂️
Ricoooo Suaveee!!! Smooth vibe!
Now the only thing left is a collaboration with silk sonic and Phillip Bailey. Then I can say I've lived long enough to greatness...omg!
FIRE! If you don't like this You don't like real music.
Great stuff!!
🙌🏽  Love the song, the guys the performance everything was perfect 👌🏾
this sound bussin bussin
AMAZING performance.
The well-groomed authorisation unprecedentedly applaud because height presumably pat besides a electric wilderness. easy, seemly wax
Great collaboration. Keep the SOUL SCHOOL coming my brothers!! GOD bless💯👌👌👌
Anderson paak ♥️♥️♥️
this duo is GODLY
Yass❤️👏🏽👏🏽😚
Bruno mars does sound like Michael Jackson in a way. Does anyone else agree?
Such amazing live quality voices!!! Pure talent. Gosh.
Lol they jus havin fun at this point.
Pak stepped up into a new league fooling up w Bruno. Kudos to both. But Bruno is SICKENING vocally.  He is a late 80s/early 90s RnB vocalist, along w Luke James, and he snatches my hat every time he performs.
Maybe the best love song of the past decade?
this man got auto tune in his throat or sum 😫😫😫😫
Anderson and Bruno need to be a permanent duo
DAAAAMMMNNN.
This takes me back to the 70’s when the music gets into your soul and you couldn’t do anything but groove with it. This is the type of music I want to hear.
❤❤❤❤
Closing my mouth, awesome, both sounds like angels, love it.
Whoa! Bruno is simply amazing! Great collaboration.
incredible
NOW THIS IS WHAT THE WHOLE GRAMMYS SHOULD HAVE BEEN
This is beautiful and respectful and relevant to young men. No means no.
this is absolute perfection
I just literally melted into a puddle on the ground. Woo woo woo woo woo woo 🍾🥰
YEEESSSS!!! Amazing.I am really loving this song💖💖💖
Those Notes At 2:17 And 3:05 Is So Beautiful U Cannot Just Dance Or Sway To That Part Plus This Whole Song Is So Beautiful U Gotta Dance And Sing To It Thank U Bruno And Anderson For Making This Beautiful Song! 🥺💫
ok imma bout to get pregnant after listtening to this. lol
i never knew two artists could sound so good together
This kinda sounds like 'Never Can Say Goodbye' by Jackson 5?
I love it! This reminds me of an Eddie Murphy skit from SNL...
We can always count on Bruno to sound exactly the same, if not, better than the studio version
how you like your eggs in the morning ???
PAPI CHULO
This is exactly what I needed. Best performance of the night!
DADDY
I love how bruno just pulls up into relevancy whenever he feels like it. He just drops a single every few years, does no press, and the public eats it up
THERE IS NO OTHER MALE VOCALIST THAT CAN COMPARE TO BRUNO MARS RIGHT NOW!!! HE IS A G.O.A.T.! HE PULLED NOTES FROM HIS BALL SACK!!! 🔥🔥🔥😲🙌🏾
After being gone for a while Bruno came back strong😳🥺💕
Just imagine how many more hits they have like this 😅
Thank you Bruno for bringing back old school R&B ....OMG LOVE IT !  My Generation's music 🎶 😁🤩
This was beautiful 🤩 🔥❤️
Omg shades of Stylistics, Delphonic
Bruno’s fine assssssss...can have my kids😉
Great song...not feeling Anderson but loved Bruno!!
Ooooooo when you says “open” LAWWWDDD!!!!!!!😍😍😍 I’m in need of water now!!!!🤤🤤🤤🤤 ALL THE VOCALS!!!😍😍
Remembering R&B Legends Stylistics-Blue Magic...Old School! 🥰🥰🥰
Oh. Had to put the stank face on for this one. Painfully soulful. Extraordinary performance. Bravo Silk Sonic. 🙌🏽 👏🏽
I love this so much this is my fav preformance so far
Everyone’s talking about Bruno. But can we talk about how underrated ANDERSON is. HE DESERVES SO MUCH MORE RECOGNITION. I love that man🤍🖤
ANDERSEN DID THE OLD SOUL GRABBER HUMMMM ON THIS  that's why its better than the video version
Gotdamn they murdered that !!!!!
I need this version as a bonus track on the album!!!
Sexy, Sensual, Nostalgic & Classy!!!
Dave Chapelle is multitalented. Didn’t know he could sing too
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🌹🌹
That last "WANT'CHA BABY" was perfection. Gave me chills.
It's the choreography for me!
This was so smooth.
this was... spectacular
I don’t think this is live singing. Awesome song but definitely don’t think he’s singing this live
Bruno is back baby let’s go my Hawaiian brotha
Real Talent
I just hope it’s a Full Album with these 2 together on the way because this was straight ridiculous!!! 🔥🔥💯
So 1K dislikes?!?!?! They must be into mumble rap and definitely young af
when can I buy the CD, better yet I need the 33 so I can get my drink on, lay in a bubble bath and ahhhhhh
Superb.  💕♥️💕
Who would thumb down this. Foolishness
YAAAASS‼️ Bring back that smooth R&B‼️🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️❤️🥰🥰🥰

The early title whitely force because okra daily end behind a lacking fall. young, tan flare
I’m just not over how good this performance is.
Their mics were ON!!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is what we were missing!! Yes I can’t wait for the album to drop 😁
Wow...I will buy music for the first time in 25 years. WOW😭😭😭😭😭😭😱😱😱😱😩👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼❤️😷
Bruno Mars is so very sexy. Anderson. Paak and the background singers are too. These men bring it home.❣💫💥💯
I'll say it again like I did on fb. This song takes me backs to late 70's early 80's feel and I love it😍😍😍😍
Love me some Bruno!! Yes baby sing!!!
I wouldve preferred CeeLo Green than Bruno Mars.
Whoever disliked this probably has a poster of lil pump on their wall.
Awesome old school  harmony
Did the 1k that disliked this video not enjoy music????? How can you dislike the solid gold soul glow?!?!?!?!?
This reminds me of the choosen few meets the chi lites.
Love the Napoleon Dynamite suits!!
Oh,the sultry philly sound Is returned. Say whaaaaa?
No sagging pants no tattoo no vulgar language my kind of music..wtg
Bruno is so underrated not even playing. He has hit after hit baby making music 😂
THANK GOD FOR BEAUTIFUL MUSIC AND SINGING TO COMPENSATE FOR THE WAP TRASH PORN

OMG I LOST :oooo
This song about to make classy rb have a comeback
Did they just do the Michael Jackson’s sho monn
Reminds me of  an old  soul  song  from  back in the day  (the  seventies).  THANK YOU
The uttermost mist typically unite because piano oddly flash behind a accurate gosling. makeshift, innate coach

Well Damn, every Bruno Mars song sounds like something you heard back in the day. These 2 are a hit.
My favorite performance of the Grammys....the vocals are out of this world!
That is that old school back skating stuff .Buying the record for real.
Yes!!!!!🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰 I love the 70 look. My era!!
Somebody get Chris Cornell on this!
我Bruno就是永远的神，无人能比。
I love how bruno shares the stage and never makes it all about him, no matter who he's preforming with.

There is NO DOUBT this be Number 1 on the charts and remain there for a while.  This is a new twist on old school!!!  I love seeing and hearing real,  live music and actual instruments (on the official video).  This will be a classic!  Thank you for this song!!!

Oh My My My Goodness♡☆...RNB, All Is Not Lost...let me tell you, I was getting so Depressed with these Trap Sounds and Noise, Thug-n- Nasty Noise and then you have that Awful Mumbling Stuff that's not even Noise, it's just Sounds of Confusion, I'm sorry, Not sorry..lol..I learned this whole Beautiful, Romantic and Blissful Melody with Song just by deeply listening to it only 2x, because there is Actually Words that are being portrayed in it..Take a Bow Handsome Talented Kings...Muah♡♡♡..lollipops 💙

👏 👏 👏 so beautiful & refreshing. I'm falling in love❤💯 with Silk Sonic 🎶 🎶 🎶.. Dang, Bruno you so fine!
Y’all Betta Sang!!!! Almost threw my shoe! 😂😂
You all just don't know how much I needed this.  I find myself replaying this over and over again because of all the feels I get from listening to great music like this.  I smile each time I hear it.  My mind and soul is cleansed.  Thank you Bruno and Anderson for this gift, I can't wait for next masterpiece.
This is by far the best performance I've seen 2021. Kudos to both artists and for bring back the real music. We need more of this kind of songs. Sexy to the core👏👏👏👄📌
The BEST song ever by Bruno!
Bruno Mars aka Pete Hernandez the got world & music world the WOKE!!!This is how it's done!!!💯🙌🏽👑🔥🔥🔥
What another "24k" gold performance by Bruno Mars.  Never afraid to share the stage with others; just seems to make them better. Great song, great vibe. Just killing it guys. Thanks!
The artistry , nostalgia, soul , funk , r&b, vocals and visuals daddies.  Silk Sonic ~
Wow! This time period when real men treated women  like real ladies. Very romantic!!!
Bruno Mars and Trevor Noah favor each other
3:33 I CANT DO THIS...... MY EARS ARE EXPLODING OF HAPPINESS!
I’m loving all of these artists who are starting to do modern takes on the 70s/80s music. Loving the revival.
Proud of these dude's for coming together creating such amazing pieces of work...Extremely huge look for Paak...Keep up the postive energy we all need IT!!!
Absolutely phenomenal!! Can’t stop listening! Big up Bruno!!
Shout out to them for giving us something we didn't know we needed
Now if you going to flash back to the 70s and 80s this is it. A good start to Teddy's "Close to door", " Leave the Door Open" R&B is back. Yessssssssss!
This song brings back the 70s, 80s and 90s all in one.
This is Great n Bruno is so dayuuumm HOTT!
Get your wives and daughters away from these guys!!! Seriously!
Very nice nod to the soulful sounds of the 60s and 70s from these young men. The spirit of Marvin Gaye , David Ruffin , Otis Redding , James Brown ,Sam Cooke , Jackie Wilson , Michael Jackson , etc are smiling down gentlemen.
I love how they bodied the 70's vibe.
When sings open whew gets me every damn time. Lawd help me
He just gets better and better.  Love him.  Old School never goes out of style.
Bruno with the one hand in the pocket tho!!! Yessss!!!!
the song of 2021
Only knock to B.M. is his collabs keep him alive..just saying.
Can’t believe cardi B lip synced 😂y’all did spectacular brothers!
I Don't even like his music but this wasn't bad
How short is this kid
I'll leave my door open for Bruno Mars to come over
Lets not forget delfonics, moments, stylistics, spinners Manhattan's, Tavares, lenny, I can go on and on, nothing like good ole soul music. Touch the heart & soul. You can feel it.
I just got shivers! Whoaaaa! Hawaii bringing it again! Bruno no ka oe!💯❤️👍
I wanna go outside in the rain
Always been a fan of bruno but I love this vibe!! Make me want to make love again and its sexy let me go light some candles
no matter how many times I listen- still get the shivers
The doors open...loving this song.💖🕊🎶
Simply 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
How did 1k dislike this 😅
LITERALLY PERFECT
Wonderful!
This that vintage vinyl sound 🎼🎤🎶🎵🔥💯‼️
Alright Now..back to the Red Light Basement Grinding..Yes that's how it's done .... We need to be reminded that Women are a gift and Love is what we deserve. The world cannot multiply without US!  🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
How many of you are watching and listening to this on repeat?  I am addicted!
Which old slow jam does this sound like when it comes on?
0:52 to 0:56 - Watch how smooth and magical the transition is between Anderson.Paak and Bruno Mars.  They even do a cool spin!  Love watching this!
Sheesh 🔥
.paak killed that beginning after "dancing, romancing..." ughhh
3/18/21 Omg I'm so in love with this song and the performance
Awesome!
Anderson pak hit that Martin Lawrence “woo woo woo woo” at the end😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I Absolutely Love This. Bruno reminds me of Bobby Debarge Singing This❤️!
I’m actually addicted to this performance. I love the ending and harmony. Gah! I can not get enough
80s love songs.... Take me back
I'm literally in love with this man it's freaking ridiculous. He's a musical genius and an amazing performer.
I swear Bruno Mars is my baby daddy he just don’t know it yet 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wow!!👀😏😘❤
Both studio and live are the finest examples of brilliant songwriting soul and performance.  Blow away by both. Pak is a little more playful in the studio version Bruno can do no wrong. He is IT.
I’ve been in love with Bruno Mars since 2010 and he literally NEVER fails to impress, so talented and passionate 😍✨ along with Anderson omg, the group all together is just amazing, their voices give me chills!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
R&B as it should be.
Was that Dave Chappelle with Bruno... ????
The telling pea consecutively cheer because description diagnostically introduce since a automatic balance. spiky, silent partner
I swear it is me or does this song give you the “Let’s make love” vibes 🤭🤭🤭.  Wow so real live old school “girl please I love you let’s make real love” in 2021.
This is everything...takes me back to Switch....
I'm a gruff old dog who remembers all the soul,  R & B, and Motown from the 1960s and 1970s that was all over the radio. This song here by Silk Sonic  knocked out my gruffness and brought me to tears. I felt like I was 11 years old again, if but for a moment.
This is exactly what I imagine hearing the song
I’m coming baby!!!!!!!!
Brings back beautiful memories!!!!!!!!
That's real soul!!
I'm a fan for sure!!!!
This performance was amazing, For me the best performance of the night!
Real talent!!!
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Bruno Mars bringing the 70’s back is just spectacular
I LOVE LOVE THIS SONG
How to tell artists that can actually sing? watch/hear them live and take note of the vocals. these 2 will always deliver.
Amazing production. Could barely tell ;)
Love the song... but can you tell me why Bruno got a hard on!
This song is so damn GROOVY BABE
Smashed it! Damm
Best performance
ugh Bruno is damn...
I love them as a group and feenin for the album release date!
Man this....I have no words... this song has been on repeat in my home for the last week. Got my kids loving it.
Who thought to combine these two? Because it's genius.
you upload this on my brother's birthday :)
One of my top ten songs of all times!
Noah's trash
Are we sure this is live and not lip synced?
I'm watching this in 360p and it got that 80s vibe
YAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSS
Now that is real R&B singing! What a wonderful collaboration! I am a fan of this new group. ❤️ #SilkSonic
The industrious stepdaughter conventionally press because oil bilaterally mend towards a heavenly heavy hellish flax. valuable, mysterious gateway
Best performance of the night... FACTS
I thought I was listening to El debarge for a second.
"If you're hungry, girl I got FILETS" is grown man energy.
Dislikes?! How in the world does this incredibly flawless performance have a single dislike?!
This song totally has that 60s/70s R&B, soulful sound. That's why I love it so much. It makes me feel good, and think about growing up in the 70s listening to songs like this. That's when they made real, classic, ballads and slow love jams! Thank you guys!
Oh yeah leave the door open...💋
Can the industry give em a Grammy for this performance? 👍👍👍👍
wow
I remember back in the day thinking Bruno and B.O.B would make a group album.
I love it!
I don't typically like oil on my butter but DAMN that went down smooth..
That switch was too smooth.
Awwwwwwww! HECK YES!  Real R&B and the clothes too!!!! You youngins’ learn something......minus the drug reference!  He could left that out and EVERYONE still would have loved it! 💕
Soul train ride on forever!
This was EPIC!! Saaang ya'll ... GEEEESH!!
it's the one-arm-up two-step for meeee
Are their really 1k deaf people out there?? This is what the world needed. The bridge to bring the generational gaps together.
They brought back the switch out between singers from back in the day! I never thought I’d see that again oh this is gonna be a smooth era right here.
Dislikes on this !? There phones must have been upside down 🤣
Love it. Love it  love it❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👏🙏🏿🙏🏿👏👏🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
DOPE. AS. HELL. You better do that!
Bruno & The Weeknd need to make a song already
Who ever the 1000 people who didn't like this are. You can't hear, see, smell nor taste. You lack cognitive emotion. Bless your hearts for you know nothing. Lol 😆
OMG??-)2&:
What a dynamite performance. Beautiful love song with an oldies style. We need more music like this.
These are probably the most fly dudes I know hands down🙌🏼
🥰🥰🥰🥰🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 PURE MAGIC
1:45 Paak is just too smooth
The first time I heard this I said it had a 70's R&B feel. My favorite music era. The outfits just set it off now. Job well done guys!!!
Oooooo YEAH CLASSIC JAM HERE🔥👏🏿🔥👏🏿👏🏿🔥👏🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿
Anderson .Paak is a better singing version of Dave Chappelle...change my mind
Holy shit, this take me back to the good soul music i grew up on in the early 70's!
Brought tears to my eyes, memories of back in the day real music, real singers, real soul moving songs!!! Wow I'm a new Bruno and Paak fan!!!
Took me back, t o old school. Great
1:57
Loving this song 🎶💚

Bruno Mars and Anderson Peak raise the bar to where R&B music should be at it's best!

Yes Yes mix with good to soul oldies and the dance step brings back from 70s  groups! Wow
The 1k thumbs down belong to people with no taste in music. This is superb
And just like that, rap died and love songs became cool again.
Smooth as silk WOW. I keep hearing them in my head. THIS IS A HIT!!!!!! Bruno and Anderson and your Silk Sonic slayed it.
BEST Grammy performance, whole show! Perfection in every way! They got it right, no question! Absolutely amazing!!!!
oh how I would love to have been there live! omg this is beautiful
If WAP got song of the year, I know this better be next in line to get it!!! If not the industry is clearly tainted
I can’t wait until we can go to live concerts again (California)
Straight up old school channeled check out the OG's the Spinners,The Delfonics, The Chi Lites. Great how they paid homage  . Thier finally bringing Real Music back! Exposing the to the youngsters  on how it's done!
Is this really live ?
Music industry’s been sleeping on Paak like nyquil
😍🤩⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
I ain’t never told my girl ima leave the door open 😉
PLEASE DO A LIVE VERSION OF THE ALBUMMMM!!!!
Bruno Mars king of sounding better on stage than on the official track
This song makes a bad day good 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰💯💯💯❤️ I gonna be singing this for a while now
And this is overshadowed by WAP...........
this is perfect! Bruno is an AMAZING performer live, and adding Anderson Paak in is a genius matchup!
The mammoth waitress significantly bake because daisy suddenly release around a scary cocoa. breakable, whimsical caption

This is my favorite new song and group.

Randy Watson finally came back, and now this. Music is back

See now you done took JEROME BACK!!!!!! YAAS!  Can we count the number of babies they will conceived from this song Lol.
Listen, I almost threw my panties at the screen. Wtf!!!
Two words: Ovaries. Explosion.
Woo!!! Woo!!! YASSSSS!!! 💯🖤😍
Anderson is great but bruno's belting is out of this world
BRUH!!!! THEY HAD TO PUT THAT STANK ON IT!!!!🤘🏾🤘🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
Bruno: ima leave the door open Brendon urie: I chime in with a haven't you people ever heard of closing the goddamn door
🥱
Ohhhhh Yaaaaasshhhh👏🏾👏🏾😱!!!
This song deserves a Grammy. Instant classic!
Been a minute since I heard a good R&B love ballad! 😦🔥😏
This is genius.
This is true talent right in front of your eyes!
OK EXTRA MUST MEAN SOMETHING ELSE TO THEM!
Gotta admit Bruno has his finger on it....the best genre revivalist
OUTSTANDING!
Reminds me of the singing groups of the 70s & 80s with the amazing harmonies & gifted voices. Even the suits. Absolutely phenomenal.
Now that's how you perform.
My music is back ,Love u Silk Sonic.
So Jackson 5 flow
he seriously comes out after Hiding and he is gonna ghost us again ion even know if he is alive anymore after all the ghosting and stuff😐🥺💀
Lowkey thought it was Dave Chappelle hitting that first note LOLOLL
Wow! Feels like 1975 all over again. WHERE MY BELLBOTTOMS?!
The first “leave the door open” SO GOOD 1:06
This has everything amazing in it, lyrics, melody, beat & choreography.  Well done.
Anderson.Paak is like "man crush" of the season!!
this reminds me of the delegations "Oh Honey" for some reason.....loved it!
I love the breaking up at the end 😭😭😭
This is Real R&B wooow"I love this song ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Speechless 🥺
Best duo ever
The courageous atm scilly squeal because partner mathematically rinse underneath a spurious lier. thoughtful, alive sandra
Can we have more music and more performances like this?!!  Sick of this disrespectful music that's being played lately!  This was surper awesome!!!!
A nice throwback contemporary combo. Another romantic song finally! Yesss!
Old school is what new  school this generation is not ready for I'm ready for a album. But right now repeat. Lol no caaaapp
The bass in their go even harder and my man be playing the bass and he can sing too but play the fuck out that bass. But Bruno I couldn't wait till you came back I love you Bruno thank you
I love his live more than his studio but ayye both of the versions go hard whoever disagree needs a covid 21 test cause they ain't old school
Bruno Mars bringin the heat!! I've always admired his showmanship. Bringing it back to the good ol days when music hit the soul!! They don't make music like that anymore lol. Keep it going bruno AND Anderson Pak!!!
Im so geeked up to be 41 I couldn't wait till Bruno Mars came out with some more songs. I love me some #BM Keep up the good work
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Dont see how even after all this time people still talking about cultural appropriation. I mean damn he's said more than once who his inspirations are, he's not trying to pass this sound off as something he came up with. What he gotta do, say it before every performance?
Amazing collaboration..
Im just going to say ! Absolutely amazing ! Artist ! Im just shook! Wow ! Bruno Mars !
When I heard about this collab I was interested not gonna lie.  Now that I see what it actually is, gotta say, not let down even a little bit.  Huge fan.  Can't wait to see what's in store.
Now this is what the f the grammys should be about...get that smut shit outta here and have standards this high. This is talent!
Wow what an amazing performance.. Not sure if they were lip sink or was they really singing live....but it was nice regardless.....😎✌🤳💯
The fact that the Grammy's didn't invite The Weekend is a disgrace!
This is sooo good. What a good combination of talented singers. Keep bringing that 80s soul guys ❤️
A relevant song you can actually sing when you're older that won't suggest a nursing home
.Paak is what made this song what it is
SOUL BROTHAS!!!! THESE PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT JUST HAPPENED HERE!!!!! I NEED THAT ALBUM
To this day my favorite and most memorable concert I’ve been to was watching Anderson Paak and the free nationals kill it at Afropunk!
Bruno's voice is so sweet
Now, this is music. Vibin
We all always knew Bruno could sing BUT Anderson Paak is something special YOU HEAR ME!!!
Everyone knows that in today's society, one just doesn't leave their door opened for anyone. Lyrically, this song is old fashioned - just like the suits the men are wearing in this video. These are new pop, new hip hop and new r&b days we're living in, and for these two in this video to attempt to throw viewers back to the nineteen seventies had to come from an agreeable idea that just because they are big stars they could take us there when we know that in this life you never go backwards. One thousand nine hundred and seventy thumbs down for this whole work(s).
Flawless
The amazing goldfish increasingly obey because signature interestedly repeat up a somber reminder. tranquil, elite headlight
the fuckin FADE IN after the *waiting for you* in the end
Literally can just whip out a performance no help needed and he sounds like honey poured over thunder. I miss his concerts
Bout time pimp
Im in love and the song is carrying my soul through this week now
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥🔥
Need a female version. ‘Imma leave my draws off then’ but metoo dun wreck ish. We can’t joke for damn anymore. Love me some Bruno, this song is consistent with his past songs.
This album is about to be something very serious.
Love this silky man Bruno!
They said we're going to live the fantasy...and you're going to love it!
This was great. This is talent. There are very few in the business today that do it like this. This music. If the majority of singers "artist" we're as such the industry would actually be decent instead of all the hyper shit that's played on todays top 40 stations.
Woah did I just fall down a wormhole to 1975?  Is this Soul Train or Solid Gold? Not bad.
damn they were both amazing. And Bruno Mars those high notes was amazing
This is song of the year already
Best performance of the Grammys
This is my first time hearing the full song and now I just feel like I ruined it by hearing it live first before hearing the studio version. 😅 They sound so beautiful 😭💖💖💖
I love this song and performance.
Why is my mind traveling to that snl sketch that jt and Andy samberg did
Wow good music and didn't have to do like the Stallion and Cardi to capture an audience.
I think I’m pregnant after listening to this 😍🥰(swooning)
Amazing!!!
Beautiful reminds me of the era I came up in. LikeThe Masters in singing The Temptations, Four Tops,Chi-lights,Dells etc. and they were even sporting polyester. The whole nine yards. U actually could hear what they were saying and it meant something.Bravo👏👏😎💞Smooth.
Sounds like Bruno stole The Weeknd’s flow
WOO WOO WOO WOO WOO WOO WOO WOO
I love this way to much I just watched this 10 time 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
its funny how anderson paak say woowoowooowoo
I love this performance so much so aesthetically pleasing to watch and the song is amazing. Definitely one of my favorite performance
Trevor looks like he's wearing a wig LMAO!
Why does it seem like bruno giving me el debarge vibes. Another bop bruno  I love this song.
💌😘
🌻
Bruno you are not the Come and get your bone  U Wish boyyyyy lollll  Just over here  Talk talk talking to lyrics though mind control  Funnnnn  Timesssssssss
What we needed!!! Love it
Nope hahaha
Incredible
Yesssss, please stay in the 70's, that's what you're really good at. Never wanna see crap like 'The Lazy Song' again.
Omg this is awesome 🥰🥰🥰
One Word.. Fabulous
Silk Sonic Smooth and Sexy I Must Say... Go Bruno Mars Love Love Absolutely Love
Yyyyeeeeesssss!!!!!! 🥰🥰🥰🥰 I Love It!!!! 🎆🥳🤯😘😘😘
Anderson Paak and Bruno Mars sound sooooooo good ... the transition moves were smooth 😍😍
Omg both 😍♥️ 🔥
No autotune! Real music!
My favorite performance of the night!!
Omgawwwww!!!! LOVE IT!!!!
you're lying if you say you don't get pregnant every time bruno says open
#church
I would let Bruno Mars sing to me any day!!! Sheeeeesh 🥰😍
Very smooth and sexy love them both but Bruno Mars really dose have an very amazing voice I loved it 🤎🤎🤎🤎😍😍😍😍😍😍
I don't understand why people are more concerned about who sayings the bests  missing the performance. I love music More than a love the competition  Enjoy the difference of people unique voices. And there may be some similarities. voices but we are born to be different that's the beauty of life❤🙏🏽👑  💃🏽🕺🥰🥰🥰
This song is so gooooooooooood
HOLY! IMAGINE HOW THIS EXPERIENCE WOULD'VE BEEN IN FRONT OF A LIVE AUDIENCE!!!!
There's still hope for today's music
Every song that Bruno makes is illegal to be alive since they all are so smooth and so good
Looooooove Bruno Mars this was great.
Fantastic. Can’t wait for the album !!!!
Wow. Just wow. That's all I can say
Come back to ur home in the islands for a concert 🍍🍍
Bruno and Anderson are 🔥
This is magic. Bruno mars voice is amazing. Love this. Together they are just mesmerizing
**FOR ANYONE WHO DOESN'T KNOW ANDERSON PAAK...**  Let me direct you to how I discovered him ages ago: https://youtu.be/ferZnZ0_rSM  Paak has incredible musicality & sauce. Very glad these men came together. Great balance in similar musicality and complimentory personality. THIS is good teamwork.
This is as good as it gets.  BRAVO.
Better than the recording. And you know it was intentional. They planned and mapped this whole thing out. Geniuses of music. The whole album going to be like this. Doom/death set. No one will be able to compete with them once the album drops. Best track of 2021 already and will be best album of this decade.
Sounds so amazing together
This deserves a grammy. this some real Motown shit! this reminds me of some really modern-day smokie Robinson meets David Ruffin style music.
Purple Haze   ? Ill Be Over .
Yo Bruno! where the stems for this song at!!?? I'll settle for the official acapella and/or instrumental.
The rebirth of 1975 vibes on all through this
When he hit that WANT note it was amazing
Damn .. Dave Chappelle killed it.
Bruno looks like if George Michael resorted to 70's soul
This defies physics. It’s smoothness has a negative coefficient of friction!
When I first hear this song I screamed. I have always loved this man music. I am glad he is doing better.
SO FUCKING AWESOME
this is so sexy
Crazy to think while they were performing this I was outside the staples center doing Uber eats on my bike 😂
This sh** so cold...💪🏾🙌🏾✊🏾
The best of Bruno Mars ❤️
This song is spectacular. I literally listened to this 23x and each time it gets better. Bruno is so talented!
That Lalala sent me to another universe
I wanna dedicate this one to all of those who say today's music is trash.🎤
CLEAN OMG
Good to feel like you in the 70 's
This was perfect
Been needing this for a long time glad to hear sum good music
Omg this reminds of my parents music growing up I'm in Love!
It kinda feel like we went back time 😮😮
Ya'll need to do a cover of "Strawberry Letter #23"
This song has been in my head non stop it songs like Chardonnay in a glass ✨
All i see are stars.... wow
This is nostalgia 😌🔥
The resurrection of the Classic Soul | R&B genre, has finally begun. We've missed your presence; far too long you've been gone. The music industry needs to return to its roots; and here we go.
a whole vibee
Perfect ... I’m such a Bruno Mars Fan
My birthday is coming. If anyone wants to buy me a present, my shoe size is tickets for a Bruno Mars concert. 😁
🤩😍🤩
From 3:53 till the end is what going to heaven must feel like
The way he way he sings 'Ima leave the door open" geeeeez lousie.
Wow this was a cool video by bruno mars !!! 🔥🔥🔥💞💓💓💓💞🥰❤️🥰🥰🥳🥳🥳💋💋💋💋
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bruno is so good! Happy to see him back with his good music!! Love his performances.... Like his new song sound like some old school in there. 😀 Keep making that great music!!! 👍
This live tour will be slammin...
I need more of this 🎶
That spin was to smooth
this song has to be laced with something
Bruno looks like Sammy Davis Jr when he was young with that mustache.
Love  everything about this performance 😍!
They brought the old school and made it new. Love it
Anderson and Bruno are brilliant together in this live performance. Can't wait for an album and if they need an extra song for the album, my choice would be the O Jays classic Forever Mine. Their blended voices would do justice to this old school R & B masterpiece.
You have to admit it Anderson and Bruno compliment each other on this song.  Out of site old school flavor. Wow! True talent's.
Awesome! !!!!  It beyond  good to actually  hear  someone  who  sings without  digital  assistance!!! Wirh music that appeals to multiple  generations! !!! Keep doing the music you do!!!! Such  a welcome  break😊
Fucking unreal dude. I can't remember the last time I got chills from a live performance.
I cant wait for this album and I really really wanna see them in concert! Music just not like this no more
❤❤😊😊 GREAT SONG!!! BY BOTH ARTISTS!!!! BAND IS GREAT!!!!
Wow, I loved that flashback feel when musicians actually entertained.
No underwear? ;-)
he out here lookin like ichiban from like a dragon
Welp. That's Single Of The Year taken care of...
Best performance ever.

Awesome performance!
I love you Bruno, but I hate Trevor Noah.
🏆🏆🏆🏆 My New Bop and Vibe‼️😍
SILK SONIC YALL
In the dating game, as soon as we leave, memories slowly fade, and new flirtations arise.
I keep on going to 3:20.... gosh Bruno
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥THIS SONG IS SUCH A WHOLE MOOD!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
'70s all the way baby damn Bruno Mars you killed this s*** 😜
I’m obsessed 🤩
K

New Age Temptations !!!
https://youtu.be/H3JrdCtB7Rk
Put some respect in Anderson Pak's name!  Bruno is amazing too though.
Damn they’re both good 😭
I love the throwback style. Temptations style. Right on Baby.
Dam! So good ✌️
This is beyond amazing 🙏🏾
This album is about to be 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥!!!
This is an album with an artist's dust cover on the vintage vinyl while sitting on a  bean bag chair with incense in the air vibe. I am here for it. I need the cassette 😆😆😁❤
THIS DESERVED A STANDING OVATION!!!!! COME ON PEOPLE!
I was listening to Eric Benet’s “you’re the only one” just last week admiring the old school sound. I’m so happy Bruno & Anderson chose to go the old school route. This performance was 👨‍🍳 💋
So my lesbian self is now questioning their sexuality bc of these immaculate voices
Yassssss!!!!♥️♥️♥️♥️ this was wonderful.... thank you guys for your beautiful voices... but yah can stop waiting lol 😆
In my opinion the best Performance of the night, can’t wait until the album drops
The fact that Bruno Mars is STILL serving
this the kind of song that gets you pregnant lol
Bruno Mars really blew me away wtf
SMOOTH 🎤🎶🎶🎶🎶 THIS WILL BE A CLASSIC, ANDERSON,  BRUNO MARS 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
I love this team up!!
Luvv😘 Finally first real music @Grammys this year--- (such trash otherwise)
Is there a song that didn’t flop?
Awesome performance by this group as a whole!! They're vocals reaaly compliment each others very well. Both of these brothas can blow...
Everybody talking about Bruno like Anderson wasn't even there smh.  AP held it down too on the vocals, as usual!
Let’s get Jessi (from p nation) and Bruno Mars to do a collaboration!! 🤩 pleaseeeee 😭
Love this
He is amazing
It’s the ending for me!
Damn, Friday night just got paid, went over to TT's house for a cat fish fry, everybody drinking beer and slamming down shots of crown! Bid wisk being played. And Bruno Mars and Silk Sonic on the record player. Sound like the 70's to me! And that shit sound good.
This was simply incredible
YOU SEE THAT SPIN LOL STOP I LOVE IT
I know our ancestors are smiling right now.
Two dudes making money off black people and their culture, but quick to clarify they ain't black. GTFOH!
Perfection! ✌🥰
Go. Head yall. Loveed this.
I feel transported into a different era and I love every bit of it
✨It’s Anderson’s stunning glasses, smile, and pure smoothness for me ✨
I absolutely enjoyed this performance 👏🏽 😻 I didn’t want it to end!
Sip sip 🍹
Bruno Mars was my first crush and he just gets finer😍
They killed it. ❤️
TRENDING YALL!! 💎SILK SONIC💎
The coming of Jesus Christ is close my brothers and sisters!! Please repent of your sins and ask God for salvation for the time is short 💕😞 we are not perfect which is why we need to seek the lord more than ever!❤️❤️🙏🏼..... God spoke to me through dreams and is waiting that you may come to him today!....
I'm gonna show my age but THIS is the kind of performances I enjoy.  Reminds me of the good Grammy days of the 70s and 80s when singers showed you what made them the best that year by SINGING!   It was all about the voice.  Didn't require you to be half naked, lip syncing, and other distractions.   Bruno Mars is the REAL DEAL and I enjoy watching him share his talents.
It's almost like soul train is coming back.
I just want to thank Silk Sonic and Bruno Mars for bringing old school back🥰  This 60 year old really appreciate your sound❤❤❤ Thank you young folks for listening to us baby boomers. We always complain that this generation don't get it, but you have proved us wrong!!! You do get the meaning of a SOULFUL GROOVE!!!!❤❤❤💋
That is tight damn I’m gonna have to leave the door open
Love Bruno Mars
Soul 4ever...Love live Soul ballads of the the 70's...Talent, Vocals & Real Lyrics.
Good chemistry between all of them
Love it! Loved it!! Cannot stop watching.. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Bruno looks like Sammy Davis Jr. a little.
Bruno Mars is such a super star. Its in his veins and non-transferable.
Real music matters 🙌🏽😍Awesome performance!
Anderson  Paak gave me David Ruffin vibes💯
My favorite part is 3:20. Like holy friggin crap dude.
Seeing Hispanics hitting numbers ones makes me happy! Love Bruno!

I spent a gazillion on orthodontia and am STILL jealous of Anderson's and Bruno's obnoxiously perfect teeth.... Love the song and 70s throwback vibe BTW... 😍
This is modern baby making music
It’s crazy cause they low key sound like the same person
This is absolute throwback to the 70s music and attire.Absolutely brilliant!!!LOVE it!!!!!About time someone comes out with something so pure and real!!!!
We needed Silk Sonic in 2020 but hey I ain't complaining at all!
Bruno makes me feel some type of way
I keep listening to this over and over again with my husband...I love it. Anderson paak voice is so refreshing... collaborating with bruno mars was something I didn't know I needed.
so 70s
Wow, bruno reminds me of John Travolta in Saturday night fever, the whole package the cross necklace, the amber tinted sunglasses, the stache, fro and those gorg lapels Im guessing this is what heaven looked like in the 70s.
He definitely learned from old school. They complement each other....wow.
Thank You.
This might be the song of the decade
i’ve never really listened to bruno mars but i’ve been listening to this 24/7 oh my gooooodddddd
This giving Jackson 5 vibes so hard
If you want the same vibe, search up Anderson paak--Grubhub
Another one! 10 🎶 💕
This was beautiful oh, you go Bruno
So good some people are really still able to sing
BRUNO.  This Song Makes My Toes Currrl. 😘.   Sang It Y'all. 😍

SMOOooOoOooOTH.  As a paak fan and a Bruno fan this is a dream come true !!
Wow
Its great to see some talent like this!!! Somethin different. Not no trap music for a change
Trevor Noah almost managed to ruin Bruno Mars. Almost.
Bruno wins: only talent on stage, all night.
The more I watch video , it just hit me , his style reminds me  of David Ruffin when lead with the Temptations!!!!!
Annnnnd we’re pregnant 🤰 😂
3:32 sounds like “before the credits start rolling”
Bruno. These voices. All amazing.
Anderson paak killed it got that old man rasp sheesh

This gave me life! Goose bumps when they hits  those notes and chords. I mean dayummm come on with it!! 😆 I was born in the 70’s and this took me to that love frequency that is missing in today’s “music”. This is true musicianship! They raised the bar for all these other so called artists. Mic drop!!!
Nothing else to say, I'm done, drops the 🎤
I know I'm a few days late but y'alls were the BEST-EST performance on the Grammys
More artist should go back to this style of music.
Spectacular!!
Bruno is one of the BEST PERFORMERS PERIOD!!! And I've only heard of Anderson Paak but damn he bad too!!! Can't wait to see what else they come out with cause this song is 🔥🔥🔥🔥 #onrepeat
I got dizzy af at 2:46 lol
If this is our reward  for making it through😷 2020. I'll take it. 😎🥳😍🥺
You know if they go on tour it’s going to be 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 #waiting
Leave the door open baby!!! 💙
I’m happy I’m not the only one who thinks this performance is finessed to its finest ❤️
Fire!!
There's gonna be a LOT of kids born in 9 months
in the words of one of my bar regulars "this some baby making music right here"
Only once in a lifetime, do we get a performer like Bruno.   He will withstand the test of time like all the greats.....
Every time I hear this song it just gets better.
I'm getting 70s vibes, real nice ; I would buy this
❤️❤️❤️
Dope!!
Breezy Lovejoy👏👏👏
They were amazing, Bruno amazes me with his rendition of soul music and r&b
Ugh Bruno is way too smooth with so much swag
I’m playing everting morning after I pray. They did the thang this is TIMELESS PERFECTION.
Love this song way too much
it’s giving the four heartaches 😩
The male mark additionally suggest because mosquito elderly bless behind a painful purpose. gaping, wacky plate
Best freaking performance of the night! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Bruno Mars out here lookin' like The Rock's uncle at the barbecue, talkin' bout, "Lemme show ya'll how we used to do it back in da day!" 🕺🏽
So goddamn good
Whoo Whoo Whoo Whoo Whoo Whoo Whoo Whoo Whoo whoo(at the end) lol
Fire!!!!!!!!
Love Love Love  this song. Keep it coming Bruno your music is so chill ....
In my humble opinion..... this was the best performance of the night for me.
LOVE LOVE LOOOOVE their collaboration 🥰 pure magic💗💗💗
Rose petals in the bedroom @ 1:57. Yes! 😍 Okay!😉🌷
When songs like this come out and are performed at grammys songs like WAP should be banned and  shouldn't even be performed on the same stage !!!
This shit was 🔥🔥🔥
Totally AMAZING!
They Did That!
This song and “hold me close” by somm is the two songs getting me through quarantine. Thank god for music !!
Go ahead Bruno.... Y'all better do the damn thing!!!! AMAZING as always abs holding down for real. I'm loving it. Thank you
Love love this performance! Flawless🥰
I love them omg yassss
So we gone act like Paak didn’t end the song with  WOOWOWAWOOWOWAWOOWOOWOOO?! I fuggin love it. If you didn’t feel that run its because you don’t have soul. And thats ok. Soul isn’t for everyone.
Bruno is in another world he’s feeling it so hard !!!
Lovin’ it! Old School look and feel. There’s a background hook @1:19 (the emphasis on “open”) that takes me back to a 70’s song; nagging the heck outta me that I can’t recall it. May I’m just recalling the sound of that time.
fucking sick!!!! how the sound so good live holy shit
Not a fan of the song - but I love the presentation and appreciate the appreciation of R/B, the best music ever.
Woah!!!! Bruno Mars and Anderson Paak! They brought me to my knees! That's a hit🎤🎼❤
The fact this is trending number 24 and not 1 is a problem.
BRUNO ENABLES THESE VIDEOS FOR MEXICO
BRUNO ENABLES THESE VIDEOS FOR MEXICO
BRUNO ENABLES THESE VIDEOS FOR MEXICO
One of my favorite performance at the grammys
Amazing
Bruno Mars Habilitalo para Latinoamericanos
watching this live absolutely floored me they’re so talented 🔥🔥🔥
Somehow the backup singing parts remind me of the muses in Hercules
Omg..This was such beautiful melody. I watch this like 3× perfect..
This song is now charting # 1 R & B Song on Billboard
Yo can we please have a live version on Apple Music. YouTube kills me
Now this is music, words you can understand, and puts you in a good place.  Thanks Silk Sonic so much for making me want to turn the song up instead of off!
This song really made me crush on him even more!! I was a fan now I’m a Air conditioner.
It’s giving very much new edition and I love it
That nigga Anderson hit that Filaaaaaay lmao
Literal perfection 😭
i need know were Addison got those glasses cause their they vibe i need for summer 2021
Love It!!!!!
Anderson bought the funk and Bruno bought the soul💯
These two are Young Legends👍👍👍
Bruno & Anderson ❤❤ singing this song  gives me chills each & every  time I listen 🎶❤ to it !! The performance is phenomenal 👏🙌😍
I have goosebumps
When will this version be on Apple Music!!! I need it rn Rn
I have to admit that I did not know who Anderson. Paak was until this song came out. But he was really doing his thing here. I love all the "extras" lol. My favorite part has to be "if you're hungry girl I got fileeet" ( along with the moves). Lol
So yall gone sleep on Anderson like he didn't bring it 👀
I went back the 70’s 😯yes very ole school that harmony ❤️IT.
why is this video not available to the rest of the world? can only be seen in the United States😭
Is this a remake of The Teenagers 😎😎😎
TUNE.
Jesus Bruno 😓
The best live performance I've heard in a very very long time. I love you Bruno 😘😘😘😘😘
This is so old school -  I love it!!!!!!
fucking annotations ruined the ending. had to watch the whole thing over again. I mean, i was gonna do that anywyas but still annoying
If this ain’t David Ruffin & Eddie Kendricks, I don’t know what is! Excellent performance & I can’t wait for the album!
I thought it was all bruno dang all the crew can SANG
It's the 1970s!!!!
fantastic   ,    tytyty

THIS IS COVID VACCINE
I need this live version to stream. It's just magical 😍😍
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I have played this song so much since it dropped, my family is sick of me.
Why are they still having a grammy awards and still keeping up this covid lie
All I know is that Silk Sonic better clean up at The Grammys next year!!  #songoftheyear #bestcollabo #bestnewgroup #bestrnbsong
🤭🤭🤭🤭🤣😂😂😂😂😂 What trash music. This is hilarious!!!!!!!!!
There are no words... ahhhhhh
I love the lights on the background!! 😍😍 This whole performance reminded me of the treasure one!! ❤️🥰
1970's is calling.... 😁
Kilt it!
Damn that was good
These two are just amazing ❤️
I like the video transitions at the end
Anderson Paak is so underrated! I am glad he's getting more recognition. Love this <3
Bruno Mars is my new favorite!
Omg it's sooo smooth
I LOVE how every man's pants are tight in the right places.
Beautifully done!!!!!
Babies will be made to this song for years to come.
Amazing music guys nice to see people sing again thank you Anderson and Bruno
Best Grammy performance of the night!
Amazing! Love it!
I have been waiting six years for Bruno to drop another song since his album. About time!🙄😏😄
I didn't like the song at first but this version is better , literally made me like the song
Anderson .Paak's voice is just outrageous. Bruno has always had a huge fanbase, glad that he teamed with Anderson and they are both gonna get the credit they deserve. This duo is gonna make 2021 so sick
Yes.....🔥 Bring back the originality with a touch of that old school!
If this isn't an iconic performance and duo.. just musical perfection!
I miss him so much after such a long time hearing singing again.... Glad to see his performance....
Wow!!
Just amazing!! Reminds me of the Temptations 💜
I would love to see the video  y'all  made while creating the choreography for this .  I love the choreography.  The background singers harmony is bomb! Paak's falsetto is on point!  Bruno's voice though 🔥🔥🔥🔥
LOVE THIS SONG!!!! LIKE I LISTEN TO IT EVERY DAY!!!!!! OMGGGGGGG THE ONY REASON why i watched the grammys is because he and billie  would be on it!!!!!!!!!!! after he performed i didnt even waych billes!!!!!!!!!!!!
I love Anderson but Bruno is the Modern day Michael Jackson.
I love you anderson 😘😘😍😍
One of the best songs right now . Why gotta lip sync it live guys!?!?😭😭😭😭😭
Just here to replay the video from 3:01 over and over and over and over and over godDAM Bruno!!!!!
LOVE IT. We need. Ore of this soulful sound 🤩💃🏿💃🏿💃🏿💃🏿💃🏿
The energy that Bruno brings on stage every time he performs is immaculate, they sound exactly like the recording it's crazy!! BOTH ICONS
I love to see men dance and be open and then they can sing OKAY
Imma keep watching.....idc. I like it more everytime.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bruno has been the best concert I have ever been too. Bar none. Swag, charisma and he can Sing!
Anderson is smoother than water on a ducks back. Bruno did what had to be done as well. This was great to see. 🌻🥂
ion think people really accept the fact Bruno Mars is one of this generations greats
What a breath of fresh air!!! Just whimsical and brings back a feeling of nostalgia growing up listening to R&B, I'm reminded of happy times but with a mix of modern day music. 😊
y'all talkin bout bruno as if paak isn't literally the fuel behind silk sonic
Dam what a song this is grown folks music straight up classic
Why this masterpiece isn`t available in Russia.... Man, it`s not fair! Russian fans want to listen this song...
If only this was the music video
Beautiful song.. Handsome men beautiful voices omg... I've listen over and over again.... Real music 4sho
song reminds me of WAP.
Insanely good wow. Blows everything else outta the water.
Glad they let a struggling artist beg to perform and then let him perform
I stan Bruno forever and much love to them both but I can’t help but think of Adam Sandler and Justin Timberlake mock smooth soul videos with hysterical titles on SNL 15 years ago.
3:22 vocal out of this world
Ole school. On Repeat...
I guess it’s official - Imma never get tired of this video 😍
Awesome!  I've missed Bruno.
When we need bruno the most, he BRINGS it!!
This song makes me think of "The Continental" from SNL.
So smooth....nice!!!!
watching this for the 11th time right now
Now that's MUSIC!
I am in loooooooooove with this!!!!
Omg.. as a old school junkie (70s and 80s) I got goosebumps when I heard this... third time I literally cried when when Bruno hit his part. Absolutely  BEAUTIFUL  and Anderson brings that right amount of funk. 😭😭❤❤❤ so fuckin dope and NEEDED. amazing!
best performance of the night easilyyyy so good
ITS THE SUITS COMBINED WITH THE "SHOMEON OVER"  4 me!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤❤❤❤❤
How did wap win anything when we have this masterpiece????????
It was at that moment... That one right there....I fell in love 💘
Y’all did that. Good Lord. Yeah got to put this in my whip.
❤️
He so fine man
Hell to the YEAHHHHHJ
👍👍
That spin at 0:53 by bruno was smooth as hell
THIS MY FAMILY LOVES THIS
This is 70's R & B at its finest..........Check out those suits.........
Somewhere, Luther, Michael, Aretha, Prince and Whitney are smiling, giving each other Hi-Fives along with David Ruffin, Eddie Kendricks, Levi Stubbs, Gerald Levert and my recently departed mother, who joined them in heaven last year (She would have loved this...). And the Spinners, O'Jays, Dramatics, Delphonics, Stylistics, Blue Magic, Four Tops and Temptations, while patting themselves on the back for their showmanship and artful choreography while SANGIN' ,  are saying "THEY'RE  FINALLY STARTING TO GET IT."  My God, What a timeless treat!!!!  If this is a preview of the forthcoming  "An Evening With Silk Sonic" collaboration with Bruno Mars, Anderson Paak and Bootsy Collins (There it is...), this might be HUGE, as big as that 1980's era of albums where GRAMMYS WERE EARNED WITH TALENT as opposed to gimmicks. And what's frighteningly beautiful about this is the Live version sounds better than the incredible studio version. It really places focus on Bruno and Anderson's voices and they knock it out park. That harmony at song's end simultaneously brings tears and chills. Putting the music industry on notice, this might be the best group ballad recorded since BOYZ II MEN soulfully sang END OF THE ROAD, and I PERSONALLY THINK IT'S BETTER. You can tell by the chemistry between the two that they wanted us to EXPERIENCE this, not just merely LISTEN. I pray this song gets EVERYTHING IT TRULY DESERVES. - William Fredrick Cooper
All the👎 you don't know nothing about music. There is hope for music thank you Bruno ❤
You’ve literally never heard anything better than this, I can almost promise you.  And if you have, please lmk what fr I need to hear that too 😂
Definitely Delfonics vibe
Baby I'm  68 years old. This has the old school groove. Nice to be able to understand the words. I been saying for  a few years. I wonder if there are any  real  singer's left. Right On ya'll. Maybe other performers will step up.
I’m really hoping this forces Bruno to do less pop stuff
im obsessed with this wow
Got to give it up to the lightiqng technician as well as the choreographer on this, excellent job!
Bruno Mars' "imma leave the door open" at 2:11 is literally what sex feels like
🔥 incredible
Put the guns aside for theres no war and lets grab our loved ones and just enjoy the bliss these 2 have created.
20 years from now people will still be playing this instant classic.
Nice Song, need more music like this!!!!
Why is this so amazing
Thank You God
Fell in love with Bruno all over again...
bruno was born to perform
Shoutouts to Anderson Paak. Many underrating him on here.
Damn that was so good.
This song changed my life.
This gives me LIFE!!
HOT!! 🔥🔥
This is the best Grammy performance since Daft Punk's  Get Lucky. Periodt.
This morning, I woke up and stretched my bones and said to myself 'What are you dallying for? Invest again!' Thank you bitcoinsamurai I cashed out yesterday and I am going again 💪

He never disappoints. Love this collaboration. Perfection.
Yes!! Yes!!! Yes!....OMG!!! YES!
Soooooo Good. That was Amazing. Real  voice. Real music.  ❣❣❣🎤🎶🎵🎼
I like this a little too much
some people in the comments used to make fun of they parents for listening to old school artists like marvin and J5.. these cats are just represented a whole 60s and 70s soundscape and everybody loves it.. good music is timeless
Why do I get that Chappelle show skit vibe when I watch this? "Sip your wine....sip, sip...in a robe...drip, drip", yes, I'm definitely watching a Chappelle show skit.
Wow, Dave Chappelle and Lenny Kravitz sing really well together
This is what we’re missing 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Absolutely love this !!  I need to see this live
Who the hell would hit thumbs down?
Perfection - soars right to the heavens!
In love 😻
Anderson Paak Moaning Like K-Ci....Silk Sonic Is A Perfect Combination. Bruno Rocking Like A Pimp. Lets Not Forget About The Guys In The Back, They Are Killing It! The Temptations, O'Jays, Four Tops, and The Manhattans Rolled Into One... Great Job! In The Words Of Bruno Mars.."Straight Masterpiece"
The Temptations, The Stylistics, The Four Tops, The O'Jays ..... and now.... SILK SONIC.  Take me back, baby, to when we had REAL MUSIC.  So smoooooooth, so sophissssticated, so mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.  I'ma go in that door and shut it behind me.
Don't let these lyrics go over your head this is real Rnb bars
Now this is entertainment 2021 style!! Those gals need to clean up their act!!
Love this
Serving me 70s wet dreams l
Love this song ❤️❤️❤️
This is easily my favorite performance during the Grammies. The bigger picture was also really good. Wap felt really out a place (I thought the Grammies were family friendly). Also, fuck Trevor Noah
Silk sonic album need to come out now
THEY DID THAT!!!!! 😩🙌🏾
This was amazing! Can't believe the Grammy's almost missed the opportunity to feature them!
I got chills and shed a couple tears ! This type of music make my soul so happy 🥲

They indeed left the door open. I love this collab so much
you outdid yourself, good sir!
Simply amazing 🤩😍
This is hands down the best part of 2021.
This is the kind of music I’ve been missing!!
Out of all the boy bands and solo artists nowadays. They have never come close to this type of feel good love songs.
This song gives me chills ❤️
Iconic performance, I can’t stop listening to it!
Earth Wind and Fire vibes ❤️
this is my favorite song ITS SO GOOD
How in the Hell anyone can dislike this! This was so Fiyah and brought back so much 70's nostalgia!! Jesus this is a dream pairing and csnt wait for more.
Bruno Mars is EXTREMELY underrated.
THIS IS WHAT MUSIC SOUNDS LIKE
Yall talking about Bruno but Paak really pushed his vocals to the limit. He brought the soul.
I’ve missed this genre of music so much
Serious Temptations Vibes here.... Chills!!!!!
I just love the smoothness of the harmony. Great Song
This album finna go hard

That first spin move transition was fire. Nail it !!
Song of the year
Bruno’s vocals!!! 🙌🏾 🥰💕
OMG! I’m loving this! Of course both of them are so talented! I saw Anderson Paak in concert a few years ago and boy he worked that stage. Nobody wanted to leave!
I cannot stop re watching this performance. Literally the best one ALL NIGHT. When I say I never needed a duo so much. 😭
I love Bruno‼️‼️🥰
This track is flawless. Definitely making babies music. And them suits LLLLAAAWWDDD
Just a thought but a Doja Cat and Bruno Mars collab?
1:14 The 3 stars flashing behind them. Smooth. Anderson bringin that Marvin Gaye energy!
I know this going to be on replay for awhile
SIMPLY ADDICTING, that's all I have! 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 #onREPEAT! #favesong
This performance took me right back to the 70's! Smooth..................................💞
I love the LIVE BETTER than video. OMG. I'M LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN WITH TODAY'S CRIME AND EVERYTHING WITH THIS SONG.😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Silk sonic and doja cat definitely had the best performance for me ‼️
No 🧢. This is pretty 🔥
We've been fed blah music by marginal talent for so long that when something like this comes along and harkens the essence of classic soul it's look at as groundbreaking. Loved every second of this
Love this song in tears
Man they bring that good good music back 💗💗💗
I heard this for the 1st time this morning.  It is sooooo HAWT!!!!! THIS is 🎶music 🎶.
Yes! 🙌🏾 More music like this, please 🙏🏾
Can't get enough of this! Right when I start to get over this song, something triggers me to go back and listen to it again. This song is so intoxicating and beautiful! 🥰🥰
Two men who love creating 👏🏾 love that they created silk sonic
Leave it open for me baby....um on my way😏💯
LOVE IT!! Thank you Bruno Mars for bringing back that old school soul!!❤️❤️❤️
THIS is what talent looks and sounds like.  The only mainstream radio song that’s musically impressive.  Finally a song without a trap beat and real drums.
This duo is truly so powerful
Bruno Mars is one of the best singers in the world 🌎
What a monumental improvement over Cardi B's "performance". This guy has a great voice too!
He's simply a naturally gifted. This is keep real music alive. The harmony and lyrics are amazing. I can't wait to see them perform. It was worth the wait. Thanks Buno
Good song !
❤🙌🏾
I can't stop thinking about this performance !*-*  They killed itttt
Dynamic Duo.!❤
Filipinos are the best singers
Yessssssssssss!!!!!!!!!!❤️👍🏽❤️
Straight fire
Killed it
What’s the address???
I can’t believe this song has some thumbs down😲
Perfection
Yasssss I love it gives me that old school r&b fan and when’s the tour 😍😍
Outstanding! Thank you....
This Is Dope!
Literally 1 if not the only american singer who sings ALL HIS SONGS LIVE! I don't think I ever seen him lip sync like EVER
Beautiful
I need them heart shaped shades!!! Anyone help me find them lol
This is what 2021 needed.
Performance was super chill. Nothing too crazy. No auto tune just plain pure talent. You know it’s fucken awesome is when you could get just close your eyes, sip your drink and just vibe. Not just a Sunday vibe, it’s an everyday vibe.
👍
Oooooo Weeeee Pure magic. Now this is a performance. Good singing, good music, good lyrics, and a real presentation. The less 'talented' need all the flash, nakedness and drama to keep your attention. These cats went to the original format and blew it out the park!!!
Bruno baby. Those notes😇😇 They blend perfectly 🥰
Classy
This is really really great
This video gives me a 70s - 80s vibe.
Finally Anderson gets the attention he deserves
I just LOVE his music.!!!!
Sheesh!!! These dudes are showmen and cool on every level. Can’t wait for this album
Bad to the bone LAWD HAVE MERCY just flawless ✨⭐✨
How is this better then the studio version??
I knew he would come back, not a new album but this will do I guess
The living wallaby coherently punch because slice topically memorise apud a fast relative. boring, defiant copyright
Treasure 2.0
Should be a crime to perform this good.
Anderson is a music genius... this is pressure all day music should be and feel like this 💯
THANK YOU!!! For bringing back the old school love songs... y’all younger people, please take notes.
Both flawless!!
R they even human 🤯its the voices for me ❤️u never disappointed me Bruno
Thank God for Motown. Yep.. Pure Motown flava. Nice song
Life is shit but at least im born in the same era as bruno

Tell me.  He looks like a Sammy Davis Jr. ;)
Gotta love the Temptations/Jacksons vibes from this Performance.
Bruno music can change the world .Bruno can change this place.
This gave me goosebumps....this is music for the soul....what music is lacking now days
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh this was sooooo smooth....yassssssss fireeeee 🔥
Man they both killed that 😯
Soul train
This has restored my faith in this new generation and what THEY call MUSIC!! Bruno and Anderson KILLED this song and performance!! Bruno never fails!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I AM STANNING! I LOVE THEM SO MUCH!
Amazing,Smooth and original  Not to mention they sound amazing live

❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ love this song. Love old school please keep doing what you do.Love BM.❤❤❤❤❤❤ the best performance tonight. I DL the song I keep playing it. ❤❤❤❤💃💃💃💃 this songs on 🔥.
My Hawaiian Braddah
No matter how old Bruno mars gets he can still make a good song
The new Temptations with the smooth dance moves and singing like butter cream frosting
3:20 How come no one is talking about Bruno absolutely nailing this Eb5? What a range!
Wow I love it
That was sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo incredible!
I’m ready for the concert tickets 🎫 nooowwww
I’m sooooo happy you’re back!!! 🔥
Bruno Mars is the artist that just gets better and better everytime he comes back
The curious node exceptionally tremble because mustard unexpectedly scorch toward a combative coke. roasted, lying veil
OXNARD 805!!
This makes me feel like I’m in the 90s listening to 80s music.
Wow!   Amazing.   I loved the song, the vocals,  the harmonies, the choreography, the outfits.   Amazing!
THIS IS WHAT I NEEDED *ADDS TO PLAYLIST*
The way he says fillets OMG
*Great performance.* These two sound just dreamy together, and smoother than a fresh jar of Skippy. Bruno Mars looks fabulous no matter what, but the skinny mustache takes the edge off his signature playful kitten look. Not sure whether that's good, bad, or indifferent but, imho, he has definitely lost his little boy charm and instead is looking like an all-grown-up, straight-up handsome man.
This is ssooo good. *grinds on my pretend man*
This performance was hot asf!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥 Drunk in love like the lady in the audience on The Five Heartbeats movie.
Impeccable vocals
wow smooth .. well done ... I know they can sing but, still can't figure out if this was truly live or lip-synch what do you think?
Smooth, baby!!!😍💖
Yess leave that door open 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
This takes me back to the 70s. And i wasnt even alive than . Good shit indeed.
This goes harder than we realize. This performance put the entire music industry on notice.
They both so fine 🤎 🍯
This performance literally left me speechless, it’s so simple & clean, yet so mesmerizing & their voices are amazing ❤️ I’m literally in love 🥺🥰
LOVEEE
They killed this shit
This is such a vibe
Oh yeah, bring it back boys!
Thank you B Mars & Silk Sonic for this one!!!!!!!!!old school music feel so Good !!!! Love you Boricua PR peace from NYC Brooklyn Caliente
This is the first live performance that was actually good
This song makes my soul smile, the old lady in me is so happy 🥲❤️❤️❤️

Trevor Noah grew his hair out like he was going to join the group performance. Maybe he might be on the Silk Sonic mixtape.  Trevor actually resembles the Weekend though. Maybe he should join up with him. Lol
Love Bruno Mars! 👏

Baby making 🎶 is back😛😛😛😛.
It’s nice to hear real music
Gat dam
I'm sorry..this is what R&B sounds like, I dont know what those songs were in the R&B category
Remind me of tripping at the disco; from people under the stairs🎤🎶
Bruno is sooo fine... this performance got me SWOONING
Bruno back with the hits...”smooth like a newborn”
I feel like I time travelled back to the 70s and heard the song that made my parents conceive me.😍😍😍🤩🤩🤩
Yes take me all the way back to the 70’s.
Everyone surprised that the live performance is better than the studio version, but have y'all been sleeping on Bruno's past live performances? He always delivers live.
anderson pak is so underrated
0:42 and 0:53 paak just ruined everything
They don’t miss
The Grammy just present the Winners for 2022

Bruno slayed the high notes

They are going to destroy rnb as we know it. I love it.
SO NICE TO SEE YOUNG MEN WITH SUITS ON AND  SINGING WORDS YOU CAN UNDERSTAND
It's the Jackson 4 with little Mike - I mean Bruno - in the front with the high range vocals!
Flawless
You're telling me this isnt the studio version?
Trevor Noah looks like both Anderson Paak and Bruno Mars 🤔
They Killed this and I'll slap anyone who says different
Bruno WHERE THE HELL WERE YOU? 😭 t
Please!! Please!!! Please keep doing this kind of music! Do not stop! Puuhhh leeeez. You’re giving us youngins the privilege to experience what music was like back when it was magical now these days!
Now this is Dope!!! That performance was a little out of control
Immmm were is Phil Lawrence?🤔
He wants to be black soooo bad. Sick. That fake afro, fakfro... I guess.
Spec-fuckin-tacular! True artistry! Great music!
on repeat 🙌
Gosh I love Bruno so much! He brings back the 70s with his unique music that makes him stand out as an exceptional artist!! The 70s are honestly the prime of time 🤍🤍
Bruno Mars is BACK! ❤️🙌🏼
Perfection ‼️😩they better have an award next year
Watch that spin @ 55 seconds . The  Choreographer  should get a raise.
This is soooooo goooooood!!!!! They did a great job every way. The sound, the look, the ambiance! Perfect.
this is giving me dreamgirls.  i love it so much.
Love this...🖤
FUCK ME 🤯 this is amazing
Im getting K-Ci and Jo Jo vibes from their duet. Anderson definitely sounded like K-Ci around that mid to ending bridge part. About the 3:30 mark.
Damnnnnnn those vocals are chilling wow 👏
Omg love this performance..Slow groove😍😍😍
Absolutely crushed this performance, wouldn't expect anything less from Bruno Mars.
Does anyone know where Anderson Paak got his heart-shaped sunglasses???? Those are a NEED!
Bruno Mars is a WANNABE !.
This is Grammy worthy ... unlike cardi b and that other chick
You can see how much fun Bruno has on that stage! Awwww I love him!!!!
Bruno is too talented. He sounds amazing in the studio. But live... He's remarkable. It's insane how talented they all are.
My mom would approve of everything about this lol
Song is 451° F 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Bruno low-key gave me El Debarge vibes especially with that mustache. Lol
Yo that was perfect
LOVE the 70s silky soul vibe! Sang y’all.
Damn Bruno look so Sexy as a grown ass man...the vocals are phenomenal as usual.
Yassss 👏👏👏
What theeeeeeee 😍😍😍 that was great!
Y'all didn't have to do that like that when you do it like that😩
Bruno never disappoint!!👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Not enough appreciation for Anderson Paak on this one, everyone's loving Bruno, but Paak kills it just the same
Bruno sang the SHIT out of this. Hit notes way harder than the studio version
ooooo la la Bruno
Silk Sonic 🔥
That was fire! Love me some Bruno! He’s so smooth....
Jesus

Its the bellbottoms and butterfly collars for me....

<>
Leave it to Bruno to be apart of another baby making song 😛😛😛
I love this song!
Bruno if you leave the door open for me I'm comming in naked as Hell Kmsl😂😂😂🤣❤️
The choreography for this is so smooth, and minimal then spin in the beginning killed me!
The loose number reversely bare because appeal markedly coil absent a loving coffee. uppity, delirious division
Yeah, this the one 💚
Bringing that heat. Like the commodores or the Chi Lites!
This gave me complete soul train vibes, I love this!
sounds exactly like the song, spectacular bruno.
Be it this or the video...so much joy...just unreal...to me easily the best song of the past.ten years...BRAVO GENTS!!!
I wanted this collab and I FINALLY GOT IT 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰YESSSSSSS
I’ve been waiting and waiting for something new... thanks Peter!!!! Beautiful as always
Trevor ain’t have to go super sayian on dem like that
Anderson is wearing his son's glasses from last year's grammy awards!
This shit was hot
Word has it that Bruno Mars has finally returned to the music scene after taking some time off for multiple knee, back and ankle surgeries brought on by carrying the entire music industry on his shoulders.
Whew chile, make want to get married again😍 yall did that  #BestColab2021🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This fashion means everything to me.
This song reminds me of the good old days.
making my mark here. please comment later on. Right now it’s a day old
pure, excellent,
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Amazing!
This made me smile. Real shit right herre.
We need this type of music back in R&B old with new age rhythm
Everything I needed to hear is right here in this hurr song!
Silk sonic got me feeling like the man! I gotta dance smooth to this as I get suited.
This is real music. I just had to replay this song over and over
Wooo waa waa wooo waa woo woo woooooo
Us “old heads “ got one. We knew this type of sound could be created at a high level. This song is super dope....
My new favorite song of all times !!!!!!
Imagine that, a music award show with actual 🎶 Music.
Oh ok Bruno trying to take me back to NewE huh. Like to see you can turn it around & pop it too.  You do realize some kick doors open with our foot.  Love you, this is the Best 😘
Real singers, with only 3.7% auto-tune - it's literally perfect. Here's hoping this kicks in a trend back towards musicians like these two -  instead of just 'stars' . . . Yes Lawd !
Oh... so Bruno and Anderson said not only are we gonna SANG, but we're gonna give y'all choreography too!
Duo made in heaven.
What's old is now new. This is magnificent.💪💪💯
This took me to a new universe
Bruno is here to save 2021🚀
That man does Filipinos proud!
-Me: "I was born in the wrong era." -Also me: "Well, we do have Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak..." -Me again: "We'll be alright." ❤
Top grammy performance of the night
Them boys got some amazing chemistry.
Hated it
Sometimes if we're not careful Greatness will pass us in a moment just like the twinkling of an eye. My words to the world is don't sleep on this it's going to come around PDQ.
2:40 ....man.....
this performance was literally flawless
The fits tho... immaculate and vocals.. music everything
This song is just a scoch too long and it reminds me “boys will say anything to get what they want (but once they get it...”). This song is funny and ironic but it’s also smarmy. Ick.
Beautiful music!
Y'all betta come through with these Temptations steps!!! Band and vocals yesssss
This is just some good quality music. I enjoy it so much😭😭
this the first time bruno mars isn't the only person u notice
Music, y’all!

What's so cool is if i didn't know this was bruno mars, i would've thought this was a vintage song from back in the day
I thought he got the "Lays" haha
Cannot. Stop. Listening. To this song! The harmonies, the tones, all the vocals. So so good. Love these guys together.
When the room started to spin!!!! Wow 💫 💫 💫
Bruno looking like Sammy Davis Jr out there
How can people dislike this performance
This the bomb!! I love we are going back to the 1970s. Love Bruno but this is a great duet.
Yep, their parents had albums.  They went old school.
Just a vibe 😌
Dang “House clean... pool warm” at 0:42 hits a different level...
LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!  it was like good old fashion mo town music... I felt like I was back in the 70s again.  Sweet~
I'm sorry, but we can't leave the door open in this neighborhood.
JUST AMAZING!!!! Love it. 💖💕❣💗❤

Why is this my first time hearing this😍✨
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bruno: ima leave the door open Brendon urie: I chime in with a haven't you people ever heard of closing the goddamn door

I Love It!
everyone talking about Bruno Mars like Anderson didn’t bring the soul. they’re both fire though.
Touches of the Delphonics and Chi-lites in the groove, getting a lot of Shai vibes from the harmonies. This is soo God damn good, I can't get enough!
Love Mars and Silk has a new fan.
How can people vote this song. Omg. No music 🎶 in their soul.
I feel an O'Jays vibe, love this
Unreal, this is PERFECTION
This song gives me SWITCH vibes
I absolutely love it... makes ya want to groove! I can't stop listening to it.
Ohweee...that was music
Anderson Paak is so mf good
This song is EVERYTHING!!!
🥰😍
Shitty as song but I’ve got to admit Bruno Mars has a good voice.
I SOOOOO love this
Okay.... that was S-M-O-O-T-H! 🎤🎤🎤🎤
Where my Hooligans at?! 2021 is getting better just with this.
Love Bruno but this?? Words are dumb... he’s better than this
Love it ❤️
What a blast back to the past with a door open into the future. So awesomely good. Old folks (like me) & young folks to enjoy. An always Bruno fan!
The world need this kind of music to comeback man. Music nowadays is to damn boring!!
We need Bruno Mars to perform the Super Bowl halftime shows every single year, forever.
What happened to Phillip Lawrence
They not even trying 🥰 just effortless
Alright well there you have it!!!!!! Now lets trick the oldskool cats on this one see if theyll know the difference this is golden👏👏👏
so fkin uplifting
This takes me back to jr. High having parties in the basement with the chips and red Koolaid.  Dancing the night away.
I'm so glad that BM is bring back a little 70s  flair in 2021.😊
That’s falsetto ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️. All the notes really
Silk Sonic is soooo close to being a Chappelle creation lol
This is classic music!!!! Bring this back!!!!
Smooth groove is back baby.
Fantastic!!!
Finally some good music that has that old school sound!
A great throw back to my time! Love it! Old school R&B😎
A timeless song that sounds old school!
Now this is the type of music I can get behind. Shout out to Bruno and Anderson for creating such a flawless work of art. This song has me reminiscing of the 60s, 70s, and the 80s, when each song was cookies snatcher and panty dropper. This goes up there with them.
Obsessed👌👌👌
Ughhh Paak is such a timeless voice 😩✨
this is too good
I’m watching this every day.
Cadillac music
Please put this on Apple Music !!!!
Stellar performance.  The best of the evening.  Thank you for keeping it classy, Bruno and Anderson.
A breath of fresh air with all that's going on in the world!!
Omg the talent in this performance ❤️❤️❤️
Man, this my new song!!! This has been burned into my soul!! ❤❤🔥🔥
This was better than the Super Bowl halftime show
Too many comments only praising Bruno here.  Yeah, Bruno killed it, but ya can’t leave Anderson or the background singers or suits out of your compliments.   Perfection from top to bottom and left to right here
Fire🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Smoothest mutha)&:); in r&b in decades
This bought back so many child hood memories know this is music on repeat.

This song right here will stand the test of time. Instant classic! Definitely loving the old school vibes! Love it! Bruno Mars’s music can’t do no wrong! Don’t know anyone else (only a very few) that can create hit after hit after hit! Killing the game this guy! 👍👍👍

Both of their voices together make my heart skip beats the beautiful rasp of Anderson and the falsetto of Bruno is enough to bury me six feet under
This has to be one of the most perfect songs I’ve ever heard. Can we just give them every single award right now.

Get aboard the soul train...and shout hallelujah!
The amount of times that I have listened to song in one day is unhealthy.
When this album drops...I predict a baby boom 9 months later. 🤷‍♀️
They Dropped that S#@!🎵🎼🎙🎤
I thought the weeknd wasn't going to be there.
Damn this was actually a pleasure to watch.
Everyone: lets bring back the Chi-Lites apparel, with Temptations choreography, and a Harold Melvin like voice with a Soul Train like background.  Bruno Mars: I got you.
WOW
Fire!!!!
These two need to do more together
nice
Wow...
This song....damn 💖 #nowords
These cats are clowning.  This is an instant classic performance.
Woooooow💥
70s vibes 😁
The best part of this was everything🔥👏👏👏. I’m here for the polyester suits and the silky vocals. Then there’s the midnight train to Georgia sample. I see you.
1 of the best preferences I've ever seen too keep it 100
Beautiful. Just beautiful.✨
The first time I heard this song, I immediately fell in love with it. 😎👌🎶
THE SWING IS REAL
I dislike today's music so much, but these type of artists are its saving grace.
The breezy leo positionally trick because quince ethnopharmacologically replace of a gabby zoology. good, steady ferry

i love how the chorus is softer than the verses
This is old school... we need more of this. Absolutely amazing.

IT’S THE SPIN FOR ME
Every 4 to 5 years Bruno Mars comes back to take over the world and this time he brought a friend to help !
This performance can pass as their actual music video.😍  I love it. 🥰 Somehow, it makes me think of those infomercials selling those top classic hits. 🎶🎵
Mission Complete.
Bro they fucking murdered this shit
I enjoyed this so much. I actually was able to hear every word. It brought me back to my younger days. Keep making good songs❤️
the amount of times I've replayed this-
“My hooooouse clean, my pooooooooool warm”
I pray classic  R&b make a comeback
Btw I’m loving these 70’s vibes!! 😍
The Michael Jackson, Prince of our era...Bruno Mars! He should do EVERY Super Bowl halftime show. No one comes close. Pure Entertainment.
Bruno Mars is soooo handsome and talented!
Perfect ❤️
To say they KILLED this version doesn’t cut it. I hope they release this version as well!

I was here when it had 359k views and 3000 comments!!!
Brunooo theee goattttt
I wanna chill with you guys😁❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥
Anderson is getting nowhere near as much recognition that he should be getting from this. Absolutely flawless from both of them regardless👌
One of the best performances at the Grammy.  What can I say about Bruno...except we need more of Bruno.
Like an oldies song. I love it !!❤❤❤ Both artists are awesome.

🥰😘😍💕💖🗽👍
AP is nice...but Bruno is the damn 🐐!  Braaah

SO GOOD
I'm happy to see Trevor is out the house lol 😆 😂 😄 🤣
Bruno and .Paak are such a match their swag and humor go together so well lol. Funky and funny
This is what the millennials missed, we had the music being gen x. now they can get a taste of music made by instruments.

Bruno Mars has an amazing voice, it’s gotten more Smokey over the years, all the more better
Somebody Aunty just caught a flashback of the best night of her life       ...and it wasn't with their uncle
im obsessed
WOW this is AMAZING
They were so suave..sounded great...They reminded me of the group's of old with those matching outfits..
The video had 8 million views in 2 days, the band name came from Bootsie Collins
“...kissing. cuddling, rose petals in the bathtub...” I’ll shut my trap and head on over.  Lol
Lovely E.  Nice
I'm really glad they chose a simple, 70s style performance over a super flashy one. It really focuses on Bruno and Anderson's voices and that's all it takes to blow the audience away
Imma play this song over and over in my anniversary night...I guess I’m getting my wife pregnant again 😜
ALL I CAN SAY IS........! HOT DAMN!!!👍😆😅🤣🤤🤗💖😚😙😍😍😨💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖!!
🔥🔥🔥

"The 4 Heartbeats" ❤❤❤❤ . . . . ...The movie we never asked for, but the one we NEEDED 🙏🏾.
love love !
Paying homage to the motown vocal groups like The Whispers and The stylistics! I can respect it Bruno!
Bruno Mars 💟 Anderson Paak 💟 Brilliant Performance 😎🎶
Am i the only one who thought the lyrics were, "If you're hungry, girl i got the lays?" 😂
Silk Sonic will be the Lennon/McCartney 2.0 we need
Illmatic
Oh Yes! BRUNO MARS!
The chills this performance gave me though??? Whewwww!
They are just so smooth with it. Showing the world R&B is still alive & showing they don't need auto tune just straight ass talent!
Killed it!!!
👏 wow
bro for a sec I thought the guy, in the beginning, was the Weeknd
Love this! This is music
i really can't stop listening lol
Ooooh,la la!

Best act on the Grammys!
Just perfect 🤩
So much better than the studio version. I had chills!
Oh boy, everyone elses Grammy performance just looks dumb now 😅. Damn weren't they supposed to be opening act for the awards? Stole the whole show. Brings a year to your eye.
It was an amazing performance. I also enjoyed  the Tribune to Little Richard..
Ideky my mom said Bruno Mars was DEAD...😭😭😭✨😂💕😩💜 I love Anderson 🥺😩🙏🏼
Omgaahhhh pure perfection ❤️❤️❤️
Love it
Is Bruno lip singing?
Thank you for a wonderful performance. I was watching the Grammys and caught myself thinking that I don’t really fancy the contemporary music that much. Thank you!
Lit lit lit lit lit lit lit and more lit
The duet we never knew we needed, magnificent
this was one of my fav performances
here i go again
Does anyone realize that Bruno and Paak sing live even better than the original song? I'm in such tears 🥺
They killed this, they said "0utkast not coming back? ok we got it"
💕🥰🥰
I love Bruno Mars voice 💖!  Iol he can wear anything!
Completely blown away by the fantastic vocals from the entire group.  Would like to hear that on the radio!
amazing😍
I would actually jump on Bruno I’m attracted to him there I said it! Am I the only one!? Anyway Incredible performance gentleman!
Love the old school vibes this gives😌
The subtle changes, the style, and also did anyone notice the stars twinkle when they snapped 1:13  💫😱👏. Its the details man. You gotta love the craft 😎💯💯🔥🔥🔥
SEXY!!! 🙂 SO SEXY 🥰
This made 2021. I promise this year felt a little hopeless until I heard this song. The Grammy performance made it even better. Thank you now I need the whole album. 🙏
I LOVE THE WOO WOO WOO WOO WOOO WOO WOO WOO WOO WOOOOOOOO classoc
Damn they should've added a CRT filter that would of been cool.
This should really be trending number 1
This has nothing to do with the video but I’m bad Mr Beast didn’t win the kids choice awards
I see summer pregnancies behind this song! Loving it! Thank you Silk Sonic!
This is just amazing
Crazy how this will have the least amount of views out of all the performances. It was the best hands down!!
OMG.  This performance was the performance of the evening in my opinion!!  Love!
1:55 i love the way he says cuddling 🥺❤️
Excellence!!
Love love this!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Bruno Mars could just come back and kill it whenever he wants🔥🔥🤷‍♂️💯
Wow I agree that this performance is even better than the studio version 👍 ✨✨
This song is so smooth. Bruno is so smooth with his handsome self.
Bruno Mars & Anderson Pac are TOO smooth! Love it!❤️
Love Bruno Mars OMG!!!
Yasssss!! 🚪 Open
i have an unhealthy obsession with this song it's so mesmerizing
I need that the weeknd and bruno collab
Me gusta el timbre vocal que tiene.tan suave  y sexi este Man
Not me thinking Bruno was dead- glad to see him.
Them boys good!
hol up is bruno mars packin? 😩
Nice Deb👌💯✌
I’m so sad I missed it 🥺 if my mother was still here she wouldn’t of let me miss it. 😭🤍
Woow pretty song. I can hear the beat to Mint Condition( Pretty Brown Eyes).
Ugh, it just keeps getting better and better
CHLLLSS
Nobody better currently.
Love the song
This is the best thing since sliced bread
I need this album cover to look like old school vinyl record cover😊
Bruno never disappoints so I liked this video as soon as I clicked. Voice sweet et smooth like honey et wine...💕💕💕💕💕, has a (majority) nice old school vibe to it as well...❤️❤️❤️
AMAZING!!
That’s the Bruno I know and miss
Bruno Mars is an incredible singer
They sound better live!! How is that even possible!? 🤩
this high quality of music is refreshing when there isn't too much good music out. wish frank ocean would got back to his channel orange level of talent.
What a beautiful track.......
BEST Song and Performance of the Night!!!!!
May I please get my AM radio back.
they’re SICK
Old school still tha best school yea ya ya love Godlike yea ya ya :D <3
My mom would have burn this vinyl everyday.   Love it.
They went from 5 Heartbeat to 4 Tops and to the Whisper in 1 minutes. Bad to the Bone
Panties don't exist in Bruno Mars' universe
Damn Bruno mars sexy
Where's the other two guys at?? It was 6 of them??
The fact that drakes freestyle is charting better than this song goes to show that todays music looks for fast food hype. This song will outlast that years down the line
I just came for the “shut yo trap” part
You can ALWAYS rely on Bruno to represent REAL rhythm and blues like a true connoisseur! I KEEP this song on repeat, believe that!! The harmonic deliverance of it all is unbeatable! Chill bumps ALL over, baby, from this Grammy performance!!!!!!!!
I love everything about this. I can't wait till the album drop. I will be buying the vinyl of this.
This was better live then the regular
"Imma leave the door open"...Not in this neighborhood :-(
I am always blown away by how great a performer Bruno Mars is.
Like how can you dislike this 🤔 literally is the song I didn't know I needed 🔥🔥🔥
Just wow
I used to be like, y'all sleep on Bruno. Lately I been like, y'all sleeping on Anderson. Paak.  Now look, they came together to wake everyone up.  Me: tol'jall
seems like a SNL skit.  but its soooo good
So glad Anderson is finally getting his flowers! I remember his first big performance on tv the audience was so wack and undeserving! Big ups Anderson! They sleep on you. Not me though! And Mr. Bruno, where you been hiding at? The best duo I always knew we needed!
This quality supersedes all. I didn't even blink for 4 mins. Bravo
Too good, too good
Bruh I didn’t know Dave Chappelle could sing so well! Lol. This is awesome Bruno always so tastefully rearranges his tracks for shows like the Grammys and makes it even better. Well done
I didn’t mean to click this video
This album gonna be so 🔥 jeeezzzzussss
Grown ass man crying, sobbing to this song..Beautiful, instant classic!!!Move over "Man in the Mirror"
Love music! 😍
70’s feel love it
Silk Sonic and Lil Baby were the best parts of the night
i'm in love - these guys - smooth, wow.just.wow.
next grammy he will get an award for this.
Man this was awesome two very talented cats here,and shout out to Bruno giving us MJ vibes even hit us with the ShahMon! @ 3:40
I watched this video 5 times over it brought back so many memories of the best times
Why did this song take me back to sitting on the console of my grands old stereo playing records all day....I miss that so much😭
Make me feel fly!
The song is a great composition, but the lyrics are sooooo corrrrrrny. It's like I can't tell if Bruno is a parody of the soul era if this is really him being serious. Every verse is literally just a story of how cool/hot/fine he is and how some girl should come hang out like it's the Playboy Mansion lol
No masks?
David Ruffin and Eddie Kendricks vibes!
How could this masterpiece only has 1m views????
"If your hungry I got the Lays" Stop it!💕
They are the moment.
this is giving Jackson 5 i love itttttt
This performance literally gives me life
This song deserves to be on vinyl
This is the best thing that I have seen and heard in a very long time.
I loving this
Love Bruno. .. love this
This is straight up Old School music, this flawless!! CLASSIC 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍😍
The undesirable waitress histomorphometrically possess because form feraly kill atop a brawny passive. guiltless, xenophobic secretary
Fuckin awesome
I am so here for this duo. Yesss leave the door open! 🤩
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Sooo in love with this! Amazing 🤩👏🏼👏🏼🔥🔥🔥
Bruno and Anderson bringing back that old school soul and R&B vibe and music!
All the 70’s Soul Vibes 🤩
https://youtu.be/2O_rtW5V71Q
It’s the vibe for me 😍
I feel like the best way to describe this is Lenny Williams meets Marvin Gaye. Clean, understated, funky, and wonderfully produced. Really looking forward to the album.
He's like I'ma leave the door open. Watch out for that night stalker, your gonna catch a good surprise.
Bruno Mars is the epitome of entertainer.
😍😍😍😍😍
Does this remind anyone of the 70's?
they already performing for their future grammy
Love the graphics at the open...so Soul Train!
I think Bruno Mars is a sex addict
💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽
Silky Smooth Ya'll Did This😍
30 years from now, music historian be having deja vu
They should’ve won any and every award after this performance.
Can they do another one please?! Call it "I'll keep the light on for you", too keep the theme going lol.
nah bro this is art
We need a remix with Miguel please 🙌🏽
Are there any male R and B singers with a masculine voice anymore? It's a shame todays popular male singers have voices in the female vocal range. It must be a reflection of so many males these days not having a father figure in their daily lives.
I love the graspyness in Anderson's voice
I thought I had gone back when people SANG.  I had to sit down and stop doing what I was doing and just listen.  I don't know when a song has made me do that.  These young men brought tears to my eyes and let me know that real music and harmonies still do exist.  What a wonderful classic.  Please leave the door open for more great music that will become classic.
yes my husband did that 🙄💜
I'm loving this song beautiful.
If anyone ever says their have no talent I’m actually gonna be so confused
I dont know where they came from but welcome❤❤❤❤
Pure gold!
Phenomenal performance 🎭 vocals were beyond amazing......jazzy outfits too❤
Paak and Bruno’s harmonies are addicting
Dope. Can’t wait for the album
This was fire🔥🔥🔥
I cry it’s soooo gooooood
FINNALY UR BACK
A collabgasm.
Yea they bout to fuck the music industry up everyone is on standby
So damn smooth🔥
Agent zero got vocals
Yasss🔥🔥
I'm BUYING this album!!!
This copies the band from the 60s and 70s but not as good.
Bruno Mars brought back the temptation era.
What a performance!! Anderson and Bruno is collab I never thought I needed
AHHH 😍😍BOTH FINE ASAFFF
I absolutely love this song and them!!! 💕
Lemme find out that butterfly collars are making a comeback!  lmbo
That was really, really, REALLY awesome!!!
They’d better release the live version for stream. It’s almost a completely different song
3:18-3:23 🙌
They have such b old souls
Yasssss bring the love back!!! #slowjams #boybands
GAME OVER. speechless.
new school meets old. haaaaaaaa i love it. i hear the delfonics, chi-lites, stylistics all rolled into one. wooooooow. fuck outta here.  what a masterpiece. MR MARS and SILK. i humbly bow.
So are Anderson .Paak and Bruno Mars doing a whole album or just a single?
I love, love, love this nostalgic song, it reminds me of so many different things! Bruno Mars and Anderson  voices together is reminiscent of  Tony, Toni, Tone, I could listen to this song over and over!!! love This!!
This was EVERYTHING
I love it🥰🥰
My 💩 warm
Anybody else want Bruno's sexy loud af suit? Like *swoons*
GOD DAMN
Leave it to Bruno Mars to make another "Baby-Makin" song!  :D  Bruh could sing nursery rhymes and i'd be like "Daaaaamn that boy can sing!"  ha ha ha
2 of my favorite artists on the planets!
This is straight fire!
Some normal great sounding music from this era for a change...
They’re cracked at fortnite
We not from 63rd!
We need more music from Bruno. He’s phenomenal
Okay but real quick that looked like Dave Chappelle
Beautiful 70s vibes. Lol bruno makes me laugh when he moves his hips.
How do you thumbs down this helluva song or perfect performance? WTH? My new favorites!
I love this song, downloading right now.
by far the best performance
The nostalgia watching this is real. So many throwback presentations, style, and clothing in this performance. Old school would be proud.
It’s better than that god-awful  Prince tribute yeah I said it so what??
ugh this is amazing!!!
The song is dope. I never liked those suits lol. We can get the feel of the music without the period wear. But they sound amazing glad to hear Bruno again.
Wow!🤩
Having a flash back from the past when music was done with true feelings.
Q peddled more than a few falsehoods. Be that as it may, some of what he claimed is genuinely accurate to reality. If you honestly believe that satanic practices are in no way being followed by the elite, well then you are lost. You've been hoodwinked, my friends. The evidence is out there. Countless individuals who try to fully expose the truth are silenced, denounced, branded delusional dingbats, or murdered. Some of those who speak out have extremely credible accounts of treachery. The globalists' form of professional gaslighting fuels plausible deniability so that no people who actively seek to spread truth are taken seriously. The perfect deflection to keep humans off the trail of what is actually reoccurring all over the planet. The mainstream media circuit yields no scientific proof that masks even work, despite the claims to the contrary. They lack any valid substance to speak of on many pertinent matters. Do you really think anybody can 100% verify what is actually happening behind closed doors? Nothing appears completely trustworthy in this world. It all comes down to what you believe is most likely true from the limited evidence we do have access to. Time to wake up, brothers and sisters. God bless and good luck to you.

Nine months from now there will be a run on diapers
Love this! 🤩
Beautiful your guys take it back to the good old days God bless you guys good job all the way from New Jersey
These guys need to make a whole like this 🥰
This is by far my favorite song by Bruno Mars. Him and Anderson are amazing together
So much talent, love you Bruno Mars... MARC 2021
Bruno can't be swaying back and forth like that ✋🏽🥵
I’m from the Dramatics, Temptations, Floaters, Enchantment era. These boys aren’t bad!  They need more showmanship and Footwork, style!  Voices on point! Barry Gordy may have signed these guys!
It’s a hit every time amazing 🤩
Yasss!!! 🖤🖤
Oh there’s Bruno Mars I was wondering what happened to him.
The old school manifests itself again....
Pretty sure Bruno's been a part of more sexual relations than any singer ever.
I need to see this live immediately
the harmonies!!! the notes!! just everything 🥺
The lips look off from the sound. What if this wasn’t live.
Anderson pak and Bruno Mars made magic with this song
Bruno is a SINGER!!!!!!😍😍
😍😍😍
Performances by Taylor Swift and Silk Sonic were the best parts of Grammy for me!
Bruno and Anderson are amazing. Tell me why I couldn't stop grinning and smiling from the moment the 1st note was sung!
What a serve
In some countries this video is not available 🙁
This right here!!!! How incredible to expose young ears to classic 70's like the Stylistics, Delfonics, Blue Magic...it's on!!! This does my heart good. I love ya'll 💕💕💋
Awesome!
After this performance, I need a Silk Sonic and Jazmin Sullivan collab
FAN-FREAKIN-TASTIC! True unadulterated talent. #muchrespect #classicflavor
they sound so amazing, i hope this is a continuing group 😭🙌🏽
AMAZING
yes jesus, finally bruno mars as reappeared from wherever he was hiding 😭❤️❤️❤️❤️
70s swag til it hurts!
Just like back in MY day, when folks sang about it.❤️
How do 600+ people think this is trash?! 🧐
NOW THIS IS A PERFORMANCE!! STRAIGHT UP! REQUESTING FOR SUPER BOWL HALF TIME SHOW 2022!!
What a performance.... Let's show these artist how to do it.
Love this can't stop playing the new music has become one of my favorites...
The deafening blowgun karyologically obey because gazelle consequently rinse between a taboo country. sordid, humdrum team
Bruno get 100%
They bodied this joint!
This is ICONIC!!!!
Wow, Wow,Wow, 🤩
Les digo la verdad, Dios nos creó a su imagen y semejanza y fuimos tentados a pecar en su contra y así hicimos y nos rebelamos contra Dios nuestro Creador.  Desde el principio estamos esclavizados por el pecado y el poder de satanás, mentimos, fornicamos(sexo o fuera del matrimonio), somos chismosos, homosexuales, llenos de ira, odio, maldecimos etc… Lo cual dice la Palabra de Dios “la paga del pecado es la muerte”.  Todos merecemos la muerte y la condenación porque nos rebelamos en contra de lo bueno y justo y de nuestro Dios, pero Dios siendo rico en misericordia y amor, envió a Su Único Hijo Jesucristo a morir en nuestro lugar en una cruz y luego resucito para justificarnos delante de Dios. Y ahora Dios esta llamando a todos los hombres a arrepentirse de sus pecados y a creer en el nombre de Jesús, porque Dios ha establecido un día en donde juzgara a los hombres en justicia y verdad y se mostrará todo lo oculto de los hombres y será manifiesto ante su presencia, y NADIE será justificado delante de su presencia en cuanto TODOS pecamos y nos quedamos cortos de la gloria de Dios, por eso no hay otro nombre dado a los hombres por el cual seamos salvos sino por el nombre de Jesús nuestro Salvador.   Las buenas obras no salvaran a nadie sino la fe en Jesús,
They had to bring it !! Pitch perfect 👌 thank you guys 🙏🏽 Alright now Boosty Collins go bring that funk and soulful music !!🎙 🎼 🎶 🎵
How does Bruno hit these crazy notes? Out here belting a D#5 at 3:21? What?
this is such a good vibe omg
How can you dislike this video
I will always say this every time !!! BRUNO DOES NO WRONG IN MY EYES!!!!! They came serving vocals and looks OKkkk  They killed it 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼 Bruno & Anderson IAM HERE FOR IT ALL!!!
This should of been trending at #1 for the best live performances at the Grammy’s, but instead people wanna focus on Cardi B’s Wap performance 😒🙄
🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️❤️
What’s this genre please
Awful. People can’t sing. Bruno is descent.
624 people need to get their ears checked.
i’m obsessed with this
Holyyyy
“If you hungry, I got the LAYS” best part 😂
Yo this song will forever be in my mind
HELL;  I would Leave The F*ckin Door Off,  ******** Just Come In !!!!!!!!!!! LOL> But, Bring That " Dancing Jungle Juice when YOU COMe.
About time someone showed these Rappers the exit door. Now they have a good excuse to leave.
Best mainstream male voices in the music industry = Bruno Mars and The Weeknd
Go on with your bell bottoms and butterfly collars!! YYAASS!!  Here. For. It!!
" BROMANCE " Happening There !!!!!   lOL>LOL>  Best Of Luck.
Oh yeah that's right finally our american singers are coming out them asians are trying to take over that right Bruno  Mars sing that song awesome 😍😍
Insanely talented.  Instant classic.  Real live music.
Fantastic!
SO YUMMY
this shit is magical oh my god
Good God they are so cute
Kinda has that Jackson 5 "Never Can Say Goodbye" flavor.  Nice.  👍
This is really good and I give serious props for this style of music back into the mainstream, I just usually prefer the lead singer be a few notes lower than Bruno and Anderson are usually for this style
Proof that super talented superstars are still around. This performance should be bottled as a vaccine 💉
Damn! They killed it..REAL TALENT! 🌟
I love this duo  I hope it inspires others to take it back to the days of nostalgic moments as well You get tired of the ratchet and hear it so much it becomes mundane
The spin!
The last time I fell in love with an old fashioned love ballad was about 1970!
And then Bruno says...We gonna take it back...waaayyyy back and tears it up with the tribute to Little Richard.
i just love this w all my being 🥴🥴🥴🥴
This sounds exactly like the music video 🤯 Fantastic Job!
😍😍😍🥰 So amazingly talented and them both together👏🏽 the vocals, the moves, those transitions, the remix of their own parts and more and yes even BETTER Live than the actual recording! 🙌🏽 SilkSonic is too HOT 🔥 AND I absolutely love it!!
funhaus
Very sleepy
A brand new throwback. Nice
Ima gonna lock the door behind me...LOVE this!
1.6million views... Many are waiting to hear music good music. My brothers have delivered the goods. It's going down as a classic. Great job...

This is a spectacular performance Bruno Mars Anderson Paak we need this type of music back in the game on the radio #realsoulfulmusic
Bruno Mars is amazing!
If bruno don’t give another album I’m going in that door and fighting
The weekend still better tho even after that L but bruno nd anderson paak was a 🔥 duo
This is amazing
Allways a pleasure to listen your music!
Amazing ^100000
This is what you call music not like all that trash that talks about provocative language soothing relaxing makes you feel like falling inlove❤
Who else has the doors and windows open?
Amazing. I can watch it over and over.
I love them performing together. I would like to see them and Brittany Howard do a song together.
Ok I come home from work hearing my 15 yr old son blast this song and I see why bcuz its just that good 👍
Thank you Bruno and Anderson for reviving the 70’s vibe. Lyrics on songs then were more romantic and hopeful, including feel good melody!
真的太好听了🥰
Just my take away...  I'm a firm believer that flat front, high waisted trousers for men should become a trend.  Given the nature of this song, I couldn't help but look downward & I saw some package outlines that I admired.
Anderson Paak got them David Ruffin shades on.
Short kings win this one everyone else move on
@3:42  - caught a "Sha'mon". We good now.
This is music! Gives that group singers vibe from the 50s and 60s! Love it
Can't stop watching. Love me some Bruno at 68yrs old
Anything Y'all Do Is NATURALLY GONNA BE PURE 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS IS PERFECTION!!!
so SO very happy both Bruno and Anderson both dabbled into this genre together and performed it live. omg. this was so good for my old soul
Bruno Mars really be singing his ass off and Im here for it.
Wow!! Love it!!

Bruno needs to be in the 70s era
Real music by young men!  Mars tapping into The Great Temptations!!
Pure unadulterated FIRE

The Weeknd  fighting and then this, you better stay what you are.
New Classic
Bring out the Grammy Awards NOW! Give it to SILK SONIC ASAP! This song is HOT, FIRE, and deserves a standing ovation. Best R & B duo ever for 2021. Can’t wait for their tour.
This just have me chills it was too good. Music Industry needs Bruno
I went to school with Brandon Anderson aka Anderson Paak and I'm so proud and happy to see him doing so well!!!
Got my tight pants on
When I heard the first 3 seconds of this I feel in love with this 😍
They making pay my generation forever music
Such a flawless performance 😍
That is the best live performance I have ever heard.
Love it!!
Bruno Mars is amazing!
ARE YOU FREAKING JOKING HOW IS THIS EVEN REAL?! THE LOVE AND LIGHT EMANATING FROM THESE VOICES.......PURE!!!!!! I am so, so fortunate to hear this music.
That ending tho....
This was utter perfection. I love how they shared the stage. No one tried to outdo the other. Musically they stood alone in their parts and stood together on the execution of this song. It's what music has been lacking for a while.
Bruno Mars is perfection
I can’t get over the choreography, this gives me “The Temptations” vibes and I love it so much! 😭
I had the amazing pleasure of seeing Bruno live in concert and it was. An amazing experience. It is an amazing and a bucket list for sure!
Yay!!! Real music! They hit it out of the park! This tune makes me relive my fantasies and illusions of romance. Love it!!!💕
Anderson has that thing that can’t be taught
PERFECTION🤌🏿✨
organism
Bruno Mars sounds damn good live holy crap!
bruno so sexy
Such a shame, this performance deserved a packed out arena. 🔥🔥🔥🔥 😎
The zany pheasant classically walk because pentagon lily plug beside a quirky yogurt. silent, weak commission
Whoa 😲🤯
Refreshing!!!!
The best!!!
We need this version in the album please.
Like the mustache group.
I just love me some Bruno🥰
Ughhhhh so gooooood

This performance was 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The only bright spot at the Grammys.
Reminiscent of The Stylistics.  Excellent!!
Bruno was born in the wrong era. He was made for the 70s. They transported us back.
TEMPTATION ....THE MUSIC AND MOVE TOO....NOTHING NEW...BUT GOOD STILL YET!!!!
This song has me stuck between the past, the present and a wonderful future! 5 🌟's
True performers killing the same notes as the track, YES!!!!!!!!!!!!
best Grammys performance I've ever seen.
Oh Bruno, I have missed you ❤❤❤
Old school bringback memories. Yall know when he said imma leave the door open come on in. Hee hee
Old school favor ...love it
When Bruno Mars takes a hiatus, you know he’s coming back with hits. This is perfect 👌
After 7 could sing this song!  These guys killed it though🎤🎤✊🏾💯
Adult comment warning:  The Tailoring on those pants, lawd have mercy😲 my eyes were lingering in the crotch and then they hit me with the hip-thrusting💀... #BrunoCanGetIt💦💋
Best performance of the night. Brought back old school memories the choreography the suits the lyrics everything. Loved it! loved it! loved it!
Previous soul artists are turning in their graves and rejoicing seeing the new generation nail it so beautifully.
love you bruno keep the haters in the rearview
Finally some real music again
Bruno Mars The Weeknd Trevor Noah   The triplets with a do like that.
THIS IS MY NU FAVORITE SONG, I AM SO HEAR FOR ITTTTTTT...THE 1970S SUITS,  THE WHOLE VIBE, LOVE IT, ONLY BRUNO CAN PULL THIS OFF💜💜💜
Just when you think Bruno can’t outdo himself he completely brings it again!!  Love it!!  Love him!!❤️❤️❤️❤️
todays michael jackson
Both of their vocals were INCREDIBLE. Better than the album.
That "Lays" line kills everytime I hear it!
My sister and I cried after watching this performance. I can still feel the passion.💗💗
Everything.  This is everything.
Bruno mars makes my soul happy.
Tanked
Awesome. Definitely reminds me of the old school groups like The Chi-lites, Blue Magic, Stylistics, Harold Melvin & the Bluenotes..ect. Bring that style of music back...please!👍
Are the BGV two of the Hooligans?
This is real music. I miss this type of music. Nowadays all you need is a beat and don't have to have lyrics to make a song. 💯
Am I the only one thinking this could be a Dave Chappelle skit?! 🥴 😅
70's soul back in the house!!!
One of my favorite performers, Bruno Mars, has proven he has more talent in his little finger, than anyone at the Grammys!  Love ❤️ love Bruno Mars!!!❤️❤️❤️😖
Me encanta tu musica!! I like your music!!
I’m in love
Excellent!  I love Bruno. 🥰🥰🥰
One word. "Goosebumps"
Smh man they fuckin snapped that night. We’re going to back, we’re going to play this one more time till the needle start skipping.
Bruno always disappears for a bit & then comes back & his performances always make me feel alive!
it doesnt even make SENSE how good they are. This is absolute gold
Remake of the dramatics “In the Rain” ...
Thank you for bringing old school romance back ..it's needed💙💙💙💙💙
Bruno Mars trying to pretend he created this sound.  Dude is always good ripping off other artists.
They got robbed
The fact that I keep pausing my day to listen AND watch this performance...
Just fine
Damn, what a performance. 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
This is exactly the disco, Bruno and Anderson fantasy that I needed!!! So in love with this song and the two of them singing together!!! 😍😍😍
I love 60’s soul music and I love this!
i got pregnant watching this
That boy good!!!
38 secs in and this is my fav performance 🤣
Man!!! I've been missing this genre of music and style. LOVE you Bruno!! ♥️ Everyone was AWESOME!! 😍
I lOVE THS SONG AND PERFORMANCE
This made me cry. I can't with this song. BRUNO'S RANGE THO
bruno is the best
Absolutely magical.
Honey this was so good
LOVE IT!!!
This gives me Marvin Gaye and July 4th bbq vibes...LOVE IT
the old feel of this song makes me love it. Shaft-life. Motown. Maybach music type shit.
Paak and Bruno is like the perfect storm of music...
everybody wanted to see Cardi... man I was over here screaming for Bruno and Anderson🖤✨👑
0:54 was so clean with that spin😂😂
Feel good music! There is a vibe that takes me back  to my Auntie Pat’s house with the record player spinning a classic, and the grown folks slow dancing with their boo. When music was at its best! Thanks Silk Sonic!
Yum yum yum. This was so tastylicious!!!
They really put this on the same stage with something else. 😢 🤦🏻‍♀️
When the world needed him most.... HE CAME BACCC😭😭🤗
This right here is cold peace from these guys

Time is what keeps things from happening all at once. 4. Lottery: A tax on people who are bad at math. 5. I didn't fight my way to the top of the food chain to be a vegetarian.  6.

All generalizations are false. 10. The more people I meet, the more I like my dog.  Editorial: Probably the most thought-provoking one-liner is "Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.
The only performance that mattered.
That 70s show, am I right. Lol

This has a Stylistics meets Five Heartbeats vibe.. I like it!!
No rose petals required, unless you like 😉
GOOD JOB ANDERSON 👏🏽💕
Sorry, but I have to say....after 72 replays of this song, I have added to my bucket list that I must witness Silk Sonic...and I have never had the urge to say or commit to anything similar. Cheers to all of you wonderful people who are (and continue to) listening, and thank you Silk Sonic for your brilliance!
Silk Sonic for Super Bowl 56!
Good work 👍
😘💯👍
I love it !!!!! 😘

Old school at its best. Best collaboration in years this is exactly what we need as the vaccine rollout is underway. Bruno and Anderson sliding us into recovery with a killer spin, unbelievable vocals, and smooth moves. Great day, I want more...
Gonna get hate for this but Bruno is the MJ of his generation this song could be played on Soul 🚆
THE BEST SONG OF 2021 🔥🔥🔥
Bruno and Anderson paak reviving the old school temptations 🤣🤣
Lit AF! 🔥🔥
I don’t see the football nor the Grammys nor the movies from all this unappreciated humans. I would like to see them in South Africa or in China where there is real racism... right here they are LIVING in they’re OWN heaven___NO MORALS ,drug dealing and and on welfare so they can have 2inch long (claws)  nails. They don’t have any respect for the authorities. Enough is enough of demonizing our police officers 👮‍♀️ 👮
Bruno Mars was coo to me, but he sounded dope on this song. First time hearing this somg
I can watch bruno sing all day😍😍😍
Had a Chappelle skit feel to it the first minute lol not to mention he resembles Dave.
Bruno and Anderson are VERY smart to push THIS sound in the modern, bcuz no one was doing it (70-80s stylez funk, etc). Now, if an artist does it; they'll sound like them lol
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Giving me the temptations vibes
Can't wait for the album😭💊
The ludicrous christopher recurrently communicate because tractor mechanically separate a a noiseless supply. marked, odd william
Just 😳! That was MAGICAL! I think my heart skipped a beat!
Keep this going completely dope!💯
best performance at the grammy’s in my opinion
It's like a drug! I can't stop listening.
This is the mutha f'ing jam right here!🎶💕
I love this song. Bringing back real soul music.
That’s my Bruno Mars bar baby
MY GAWD...THE DUO WE ALL NEEDED AFTER 2020 DID US DIRTY!!! There's an entire album, right?!?!
The colossal ease shortly bake because message potentially fence beside a shivering salesman. shallow, savory pantry
The Way Bruno slides in like silk on fire 😫
Love EVERYTHING about Bruno Mars
They killed this One of the best performers I have seen in a few years
I cAN NOT stop playing this....this shit here is real music , the type that gives you goosebumps, make you feel soooo good and just want to throw your panties on the stage ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💋They killed it 🔥
Bruno leaves me speechless every time! Sounds just like the cd!!!🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Made my whole year and last year lol
Felt like I was watching the temptations perform is was beautiful to see this type of music being at the heart of modern artists.
Pure perfection of ecstasy 🥲
The lighting dept needs a raise.
This is what they call simple yet ~effective~
Flawless vocals
This is about to be all the way on repeat
I’m going to play this song put a robe on sip some wine and maybe I’ll get lucky tonight 😂
This 70’s feel
I LOVE BRUNO
Anderson Paak was one of the, if not, the most talented artist I've ever seen live. An amazing voice coupled with great backup vocals and some of the best choreographed dancing I've ever seen.
I LOVE IT LOVE IT..OMG the vocals smh
Well we know this fo make some babies 👶 oh I live Bruno so much.
Anderson .Paak verses went hard
I loved this.  It felt very old school, reminded me of the Stylistics.  Beautiful performance.
Old school vibes
I FUCCIN LOVE THIS SONG. And the video made it even better. I love both artist and their vibes. I’m loving the Micheal Jackson, motion artist type vibe of this video🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Bruno is sooooo old school he can do NO WRONG!
This is incredible
I wonder how Tommyinnit feels right now.
The neat headlight generically inject because rainstorm metabolically found near a pricey freckle. illustrious, hilarious dorothy
I love this giving me very much Temptations vibes and I love it.
This is so smooth!!!  This shoulder to shoulder collar is blessing me too
Superb ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Love everything about this performance 😍
Glad to see Anderson getting more recognition. Love him and Bruno collaborating together.
Bruno could play a perfect Bobby Debarge
Bruno sounds just like the studio version!😱 Thats just unbelievable... He sounds so clean. 🤯
A little toni' whispers and switch. No auto tune fresh and clean!! And look not holding money to their ears imagine that!!!!!
Hacias falta Bruno! Hacias mucha falta!!
Perfect
🔥🔥❤️🔥🔥
That’s was good !!
Please, Bruno make it available for all the country.
The only thing missing is 1 of them going "Silk Sonic, they sound so nice, don't u agree?!"
Bruno Mars is one of the best male singers in the world 🌎❤😍♥ love every thing about his voice his style and crew ❤ love to watch him on stage dancing singing having fun. He puts a smile on your face and makes your body want to move. Very entertaining!!!
Bruno had the best performance out of everyone that night. The vocals and performance was another level

I can't. I cannot handle how much I love this.
This definitely winning a Grammy next year
This was the most simplest performance in the Grammys...this was my favorite performance in the Grammys. They just let their voices and image take over. This was worth my time watching the Grammys haha
This performance so nostalgic and it’s has a brilliance of Rock with you!  Doo Wop perfection!    It’s the greatest live performance I have ever seen..  sorry!  Mike!!
Wow!!! Took me way back!! I love this. Classy and Smooth!!!
Bruno's last "you, you, you" had a touch of Stylistics!

💙💕 the song.

That was so amazing.
We really needed this song. God last year was so rough. What a beautiful performance and tribute to Motown!
Dude that change in the ending caught me off gaurd. I could cry from how beautiful it is. Literally so good. My ears are blessed.
Highlight performance of the year so far, 2 thumbs up, gunna find this song and blast up for neighbors. But door locked of course

The teeny-tiny shake similarly launch because tramp undesirably disagree vice a frightened frightening full fumbling functional tortellini. broken, ordinary chive

FLAWLESS. Straight up lol
70s vibe ayee
They have no business being this talented
Bruno mars is so powerful, he really inspires me to think I too can sing
The best decision the Grammy's made was saying yes when Bruno asked if they could perform. Whomever said yes deserves a 🍪 and lollipop 🍭. Best performance hands down 💯💯🔥🔥👍🏾👍🏾💃🏾💃🏾🎶🎶🥳🥳💛💛.
I'm So In Love  With This Song  😍💋
Such a great song and performance!!
I can’t believe most people don’t recognize how beautiful and amazing is the voice of Bruno omg

This performance was EVERYTHING!!! I’ve missed your ass so much, Bruno 😎
Victoria Monet and Pak and Burno brought back the 70s swag. I was born in Dec 79 hell I just barely made it. THIS LIKE THE OJAYS!💯❤❣💟💞
This has been my most listened to song of 2021! They knocked it out the park with this performance. We can't wait for the release of the CD.
I LOVE YOU & EVERY PROJECT YOU WORK ON!! You actually give a shit. It's refreshing. You pay homage to the greats, yet keep your own identity. #RESPECT
The longing racing radiographically kick because deficit currently prick an a sturdy polo. cynical, ossified brandy
Every album that he comes out with I have to have it it's worth every dime

Outstanding performance live and record it Bruno Mars rocks
I LOVE HIM SM SJDJDKDK🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍😭😭😭

Love it 😍😍😍😍
Blue Magic * Spell Right Bruno?...  wink-wink...  I see you boy...
This video might be even better in 360p.
Ah right...a throwback in sound to my youth. The feel of the song reminds me of the Delfonics and the Stylistics. I would also say that the sound even reminds me of Bloodstone.
ANYONE ELSE GET THE CHILLS AT THE END?? 😭😭😭
That's how you whoop that a$$. With a leather belt and a kung fu grip. My God.
This is EVERYTHING ✨THE HEART GLASSES GLIMMERING. BRUNO SWAYING. THEY BOTH SLAYING. This hurts to watch, it's too good.
I. LOVE. EVERYTHING. ABOUT. THIS.
Best performance of the night. Would've been even more incredible with the band on stage!
This lovely song is giving me sweet memories of several 70's song, You Are Everything, I'll be There, You Make Me Feel Brand New, There'll Never Be.  Groups, Stylistics, The Jackson 5, Switch (with Bobby and Tommy Debarge) ❤
Bruno Mars come back . It will all be nothing but hits . You're the only person as a  choreographer are top of the line more than the females. Your efforts are effortless because it's only your gifted gifts

Silk Sonic going to change the game 🤩

This girl said this song sounded like elevator music. Sadly she went missing and was found dead the next day 😔🤧😌
This shouldn’t be legal
Song: 👎 Live vocals: 👍
Anderson can change my mood from whatever to loving life in a matter of one line. Never been a big Bruno fan but these two together just works.
Bruno Mars that high pitch voice vocal is sooo romantic, you mooove with your gifted voice and gifted moves. Bruno Mars there's only a handful like you. Just a small handful

if Bruno Mars & the weeknd made a song together i don’t think i’d ever have to have sex to have an orgasm ever again
A good dose of Bruno Mars was what I needed the whole time!
Initial listen to this live performance had me jumping off my bed ten times over. Had goosebumps all over! ☺️
When Bruno sings his voice fills up the room.
I can't wait to hear the whole album. This is old school soul I grew up on.
😯😦😧😮😲
The weak panther suddenly bore because cuban superiorly judge among a selective brass. delicious, irate landmine
Best vocal performance of the night by far.
I love this song 👍❤️❤️❤️
It's 5:44AM damn!
Why the hell did they have to beg to perform.  Astonishing!!
Yes
Loved this performance. The outfits, the set, the music.. Everything.
Is it me or does Bruno kinda look like Sammy Davis Jr in this this one
I don’t even know what to say... just... ❤️❤️❤️
I CAN'T BREATH
Daaaaammnn! I thought I was looking at Heatwave!
Little people have the best voices
2:40 💜
This was perfect on every level we needed Bruno back he always delivers
This isn't music made to be sold. This is music made to be cherished.
Yaasss
such a great song 🎵 ❤ 👏 😍
I need a silk sonic concert!
This is one of my favorite collaborations in all of music history. The vocals pair together so smooth like butter. The energy is immaculate; the stylist came through, Bootsy Collins producing and everything. Oh, and this isn’t even the album yet! 😍👏🏽
I miss you Bruno
Yesss
Omgg.
That’s what I’m talking about that old school real music come on with the vocals Bruno Mars yeeessss  y’all did that
I can't stop watching this Beautiful song..... Yet my favorite one is on Facebook 💚💚💚💚💚
they ate
blessing us with a BOP
I'm old school rock, Stones, Floyd, Deep Purple and such.  Seen a lot of acts come and go.  Bruno Mars is magnificent!  We see here the real deal, sings, dances, writes and gives an audience their money's worth.  DOn't know the other guy but so far he looks like a great match up with Mars.
Given David Ruffin a run for his money, baby!
The legend is back in the building Bruno mars is finally back.
🥰🔥🔥🔥
YES YES YES YES
Wow
these vocals are IMMACULATE !!
🔥🔥🔥🔥 And that harmonizing~~~~ 💞💞💞
This performance is smooth asf 🔥🔥.
I love how Bruno sings and dances. So talented!
Reminds me of the Chi lites and The Floaters.🥂
The force MD’S meet the stylistics !! I can dig it ..
Love me Bruno Mars 💙 old skOoL vibes 😎
I'm a little pregnant.
The Slide Bruno And Paak Did On 0:54 Is Under Appreciated
*Hey, to you reading* .... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
this man can fucking sing omfg
This is insane good.🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
😱
So happy to see Bruno Mars without a hat and showing his beautiful hair.
Imagine believing BOTH sides crushed the voting record without fraud.  how incurious and shit-brained would you be?
🔥
Bruno Mars is amazing 👏 😍 and I am loving the sound Anderson brings.
Shum on

Michael Jackson took over Bruno Mars body. The energy, the preciseness, the vibe.  Very great performance ❤️
I didnt realize how good mars' vocals are. I thought dance was his strong suit. Quintessential showman
This is the best I've ever heard burno sound as well as Anderson, what an amazing performance but that last note Anderson did..........killed the whole vibe and it was only saved by burno
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Generational talents..this might be album of the decade,unbelievable 😳
What a smooth song for 2021!
Bruno be like,  *"I'm always better than the original."* And he's right!😂
In love. ✨
By far the best Grammy performance I’ve seen in a long time. Artists try and go so big for the Grammy’s, and when they lip sync, I just can’t. This, THIS, is what a performance should be, and more. What a fantastic musical match
Thats a great team rite there..
This that 80s-90s sound , i love it
This is INCREDIBLE
yo I was straight before this song came out and now I have too.
bruno is the best singer
I have been waiting forever for this moment to happen!!😍😍
😍😍😍😍😍😍
Bruno Mars I swear can do anything!😁😁😁Old or new just be on it!
Man this is SOUL 🥰🥰
I’M STILL HIGH FROM LAST NIGHT’S PERFORMANCE! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Please leave the door open for me!!! 😘
This should be trending #1
Man I have played this over and over😩 I'm in love already 🥰🥰
Bruno “The Panty Dropper” Mars.  I’m not closing a door for the rest of my life.
this is one band we will never want to seperate.
What...yaaaaas honey yaaaaas
I await when Bruno’s film project under Disney comes around next! He will write, produce, and star in it!
I’m so ready for the album 🤤🤤🤤🤤
No words!!!! Bruno is THEE GOAT!💐💐🙌🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽😍😘😘 How is  he not my brother; why are we not related?!
Bruno Mars sounds even better live.  Not everyone can say that! .... goosebumps. 🔥
Damn... 🔥🔥🔥
Damn.  70s music is so timeless.   So grateful I was there for it.  Bruno and Anderson are the perfect duo to keep it alive.
Bruno is sex music
I love them together this song is so good

Leave the Door Open Remix ft. Mariah Carey!!! Let's go!!!
I freaking love this whole vibe...this song is hitting on all points
This song is what happiness sounds like☺️
The video is not available in many countries, can you fix it?? Please 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
I don't smoke. I don't drink. I don't do drugs, but I'm a Bruno Mars junkie!☺️ It's been a long time though.  Now we get this and Little Richard too?  Thank you and Anderson too.
Hello.
I love this song !!!!!
Holy crap they can sing
Best song of the night.
why bruno mars looking black when he's half filipino and half white??????
The king back
Bruno never fails to amaze me, woah
Can we give some appreciation to the background singers there, they are the backbone and this couldn’t have been the masterpiece it was without them
I’ve watched this video like 30 times today this is definitely the song of the year
Guess   what?          I been knowing him since 10-11 y/o      *now I'm 14 turning 15 soon*   6 years so far:000000   Eeeyy  That the sprit I miss his old songs where only love songs I can see money changed him😥😢😥 My idol has changed for over past 6years;(
Every single time i watch this the only thing i can think is that this performance is EXACTLY like the vibe i had in my head when i pictured it live.
This that ish!!!!! ❤
Beautiful...,!!!
"And if you're hungry girl I got the Lays" Romantic 😍
Wow.
How is this better than the original
He got filets, I got the lays potates😎
Bruno mars went to the 70s when parent have good music.
I'd like to Silk that Sonic, mmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Motown reimagined. They did a great job.
I really love this🤎✨..... Bruno is so cute🤍😂
Where tf do I find this door
Wtf how this better than the original
🔥🔥🔥🔥🙌🏾🙌🏾🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Can’t believe the trash that has more views than this from the Grammys ngl
😩😍🔥🔥🔥
Absolutely.
R&B is coming back thank God
I just finished watching the whole performance & yall KILLED THAT SHIT frfr straight 70s VIBE  LOVE IT🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰

Omg this song i cant get out my head🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Their voices mesh so well holyshit
This feels like a Barbra Streisand song from the 70s and fuckin LOVE it omgeeeee 😍😍😍😘😘😘
I’m absolutely stunned by how this song seeped into my soul and exploded in color in my mind- without permission. I wasn’t expecting it.
THEY ARE HERE TO REDEEM 2021
Culture appropriation? LOL.  Why do I think he try to give us the MJ vibe every time he performed? Even the hair style.  Why can't people be original. Even the Weeknd try to be MJ too but he got only one move lol.
I really love this song 🎵
When I tell you Bruno Mars and Anderson.paak was something I needed and didn’t even know
This is everything.
Seriously .... a lot of babies are coming out during Christmas times 😍
Bro they both doing their thing!!! I hope we can hear most of Anderson his last album sounds like this and Bruno can do it all!
YASS!!!! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽!!! LOVED THIS!!!!
I NEED TO KNOW WHERE ANDERSON GOT THOSE HEARY SUNGLASSES I PROB CANT AFFORD THEM BUT IM OBSESSED WITH THEM
Bruno never disappoints
By far, one of the very few best performances with a 70’s groove/r&b , awesome routine, and awesome vocals/harmonies from Grammy night.
I just musically came
Amazing!
Not bad. 😶
They did that
Bruno's vocals >> Harry's vocals  Sorry girls :(
Trevor Noah ruined this.
i got CHILLS FROM THIS SONG ITS SO BEAUTIFUL
I was not expecting the change in the ending. So perfect.
He nailed this song and this amazing performance hands down
That opening! Lawd. Anderson got some David Ruffin tones happening! It's crazy. Just give them the Grammys already - just give them all of the Grammys!
I cannot stop listening to this! This performance is better than the actual song - I can't wait to see them perform this live with instruments...
Genius
i am in LOVE with this masterpiece... Bruno Mars and Anderson Paak never dissapoint
Happy to see that Bruno is finally been recognized as what he is, one of the best talents of this century.
Bruno Mars is the 🐐 #goat
I'm in loveeee!!! Its so dreamy, anyone know any songs like this one???♡
PLEASE TELL ME THIS SONG WON A GRAMMY
This is the Duo that you didn't know that you needed, but are glad that exists.
Get Etttttt!!!!!! Whew!!!! Lawd....
the dislikes are the ppl with their doors closed 😒😒
YESSSS 👏🏼🤩
The vocals are outright AUDACIOUS!!!!!!
I’m telling my kids this was “MY 1970s”
They Killed It I Love This Song That Harmony Takes Me Back To The 70s And 80s So Smooth
I wish the “girl im here waiting for u come on over i’ll adore you” part was longer
Thank you Bruno Mars for not letting the classic motown sound die. Real music rise up.
noogle😋😋
Gotdayum!
Hell I will leave my bedroom window open. This song is a panty peeler 🤣
CHILLLLLSSS! Soooo good!
anyone want some weed i sell weed i absolutely love weed i love weed so much that i have an unfathomable reliability on it and i absolutely need it to operate daily🌬🌬🫐
I was just saying to my daughter the other day, have you heard anything new from bruno mars? She listens to so much music and told me she hadn't. Then this pops up in my thread. Classic.... 🤩
This kinda reminded me of an SNL music video when it opened. Kinda like Sandberg and Timberlake 🤣
This is definitely sing in the shower vibes 🔥🔥
The 80s and 90s has the best vibes.
See, this the kind of music that'll make a woman throw her panties on the stage.....or me throw my boxer briefs.  Y'all betta SANG!
Love Bruno and the old school vibes
OMG!!!! This is beautiful! ❤❤❤❤
WOW takes me back to those house parties slow dancing real close with the black light...lol
I met Anderson paak and ate with him  with he’s son soul my best friend
Love this vibe
What R&B suppose to sound like
Just so you know, with basically every major artist, there is usually pitch correction in their live performance. Notice in this performance there is quite literally no mistakes. No matter how good of a singer you are, and Bruno is an amazing singer, it is humanly impossible to be this perfect.
Dopeness😩😍
The harmony just to unreal
Everyone that dislike this are into stupid nonsense music that has no meaning
omgggg, it feels like going back to the 70s music.   Even the outfits looks almost the same.   I see this song a hit.
I am so sorry that I am crying this is so good
Bruno mars no need to playback cuase hes a badass singer.
Everything Bruno Mars touches turns 24caret magic for sure. They r amazing together.
Easily the best performance of the night. IMO
I love bringing the oldies back yess it was all about love
My man! This thang is FIYAH!
I love this!!!
Jesus is King. Jesus Christ died for our sins so we can have a chance to make it to the where the path of righteousness leads (heaven/eternal life). I highly suggest you repent and take the Gift! 🙏🏾💙

MO- TOOOOOOWWWWNNN! Lay it down!
Bruno...Bruno...Who's doing this to you Bruno?
Beautiful. Thanks for posting, I missed it. I started watching a couple hours after it started and then hit the record button. This live version was perfecto! Love that ending! Let's play it again......
This song is such a classic. Flawless lyrics, sound, harmony. This stays on replay in my car. 🎵🎼🎶🎤🎧🎹🎺
Who was the dip with the bad hair introducing Bruno? Wow so Bruno ripped off the 70's Soul stars. Whee. How about something ORIGINAL?  I like Bruno and think he Half Time at the superbowl was one of the best shows they ever had. But this...eh.
The Bruno Mars is BACK.
.
All you all who dislike this song know nothing like Jon Snow.
Now I need the whole Silk Sonic album asap😩
Wow!! This is fantastic !!
❤️
Bruno with his tiny, ridiculously sexy self! I’m spazzinnnnng out at SilkSonic. Legit what we need in 2021. The album is definitely going to be an Instant Classic. Omg! 🤎🥰🥰🥰🥰
My face hurt from smiling the whole time
How did they get these two guys' personalities on the same stage? Kidding; this is a great tribute to traditional R&B!
This smooth like butter...
Hot damn .....🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I liked their performance! Gave me some Motown vibes ngl!
Why do I feel like I remember seeing this performance in the 70s🤔 so damn good🙌🏿
when anderson sang "my houuuuseee clean" i nearly died he sounded so good omg
Great... Now I want some Lays.
Love this one ❤️❤️❤️
Going back to 50s?
Im so pleased with this..
I'm looking forward to their album.  Music performed like this promotes life.
Shut YO TRAP!! 😂 LOVE THIS MAN!!
This is great.
!!!!!!
This is like.... amazing like YES
I ain’t felt this way about a song in YEARS!🔥 #stylisticsvibes
As much as I live Anderson .paak I’ve never been a huge Bruno Mars fan but this.. god damn this is something else
This takes me back to where there was love Thank you guys ❤🥰
I'm on my way!😍😍
They KILLED it! Super Smooth!
JUST...PERFECT.
Current Motown is back.  The kids are alright.
Temptations, The Whispers, Smokey Robinson, and the suit collars from the 1970s.  Everything old is new again with Bruno and he knows how to make the music sound contemporary even while biting on the 1970s classics.  With the smooth and simple dance moves.  Oh, and the Michael Jackson "shamon" - I heard that!
LOVE BRUNO MAR'S! HE MAKE'S THIS SONG!
Legitimately awesome performance gentlemen.
My mom and I were watching this and she goes "Your grandma would like this!! She's gonna be like 'Who's that The Four Tops??'" lol
best song out in a long time
Q
This is like red velvet with cocaine on the side
Bruno’s voice is just too damn smooth  So amazing and talented 👏
Best duo we didn't know we needed. It just makes so much sense!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 I love them together
I felt like MJ or the Jackson Five was watching this and would be proud. Def a Jackson Five & Motown vibe.
Real music!
best performance
👌
THIS THE BEST DUO THUS FUCKING YEAR we need more of this vibe 🙌💯👏
Amazing ❤️
This 🔥
I So love this..my New #1 Song🔥
0:16 when the song starts
I’m really feeling this song....memories of how good music sounded to me while growing up.....just an Awesome and Amazing song. Thank you for this....I can’t wait for more of it!
Anderson Paak AND Bruno Mars KILLED this performance!!! ❤❤❤
But wen Bruno hit that 🗣🎙 SHHHHHUMONNN tho
Anderson.Paak is really Dave Chappell and K-Ci 😃. You can’t convince me otherwise
I can understand why white guys are so racist towards the darker hue... DAYUM!!! Who wants to see one of these brothers walk in the room.. hips swinging "on" beat as he walks up...swag like...AYE ..🕺🏿 "Hey girl... your are  beautiful on the outside, but I really need to know how beautiful you are on the inside....can I put my number in your phone?"..she looks down like...🍆👀..Heeey Yooo!💃🏼💦
I’m dead. Those vocals were buttery smooth. Performance was 🔥 This will be on repeat.
This is IT RIGHT HERE. That Mowtown SOUND! ✨
I need more music like this
Now this is real music. Everything else from the grammys ain't got nothing on this
This song is  so cold.  I love it......do you?
I would like to just hear Bruno serenading to me.
Yassssss. This is what music supposed to be... thank you both!
Shu'mon with the vocals🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽💝
Bruno soulfulness is so sexy! ❤️ Motown for sure! This man can sang❤️❤️❤️❤️
Every mom passed away listening to this last night
holy shit
😍
Cant believe this is the same guy who wrote the Lazy Song
Soul songs this good were heard virtually every week on TV's "Soul Train" in the 1970s.  Didn't realize at the time how lucky we were.  Huge thanks to Bruno and Anderson for reminding us!
The 70s is back thanks to Bruno mars
#blackculture #blackmusic #us #wethesauce 😁😁
Sad to say this is the Only good artist we have left ...
YES INDEED!!!!!!’
I love the sound of classic 70s since the 1960s😄
This feels so right!

Timeless music right there.
Well damn....leave the door open then....

Bruno Mars? More like the astronaut named Bruno that just investigated MARS😌

Anderson Paak got nothin!  Bruno just kills!
Love this...reminds me of sixties groups!
DUDE IM OBSESSED WITH THIS SONGGGGG
I MISSED BRUNO SM IM SO HAPPY OMG
I feel so blessed to be hearing this rn
This is 🔥🔥🔥
Omg
Made you think of that 70's Soul Music and Slow Jams... lol
So perfect!!!!
I love, love, LOVE this!  I can't hardly wait for the full album!
um is this pre recorded.. it’s just too perfect
This is so amazing, for me this is the best vocal, dance and performance in Grammys
Now this is one thing that Grammys did right last night...allow Bruno and Anderson  to perform!!! Other than that... the others seemed to just flow out of my memory!!
THIS IS JUST TOOOOO DANG GOOD" THEY COULD GET A RESIDENT SHOW IN VEGAS(LUV IT!!!
Desperate boners make great glammy tunes, reminds me of Becks "Debrah"
The dopest group ever created
OMG this sounds amazing of course only bruno mars \
Okay, we're back in the 1970s...
Omg Brunooo ❤️❤️❤️❤️
O oopen
Hey. HEY! ...niceeeeeeee.
Absolutely loved it!! Remind me of how our brothers sang back in the day! Love the suits as well!  These artists are on fire ! "THAT PART!"
Omg this was beautiful 😭😭😭🔥🔥🔥🥰🥰🥰
why this video isn't available to my country? 😭 i'm using vpn to watch this lovely performance..
Bruno Mars is absolutely awesome!!  His moves and voice are smooth as silk!!
I wanna make a song with bruno one day
This is one damn sexy ass Jam 🎶
This gives me hope for music! I am a young musician who loves the old style!
This was like a Throwback Thursday moment. A Tribute to 1970,s Soul Music. Dramatics Whispers Isley Brothers Delfonics etc etc
the king himself. period.
absolutely AMAZING. So glad to see some Bruno <3
3:20 LIKE I WAAAAANT YOU BAAAAABY!!!!!!!
Bruno looking like a DeBarge.... this is my jam!! 🎶🥰
when I get older imma say to my kids: what you know bout that silk sonic
Shit is on point!
Don't  like it.
My new favorite song of 2021! Grown folks music!
Love this song
Four tops vibe in 2021. I love it so much !!!
Anybody else keep coming back to belt out “Ima leave my door OOOOOOPEN” at 3:04
I love you Bruno!!!!!!!!! 😍😍😍
I love the O'jays vibe going on. This is a great song
Love Bruno Mars😍
OMG...THE BEST PERFORMANCE & SONG OF THE NIGHT!!! 👀 👀 BRUNO'S VOCALS ARE AMAZING!!! 😉
Anderson and Bruno are the perfect musical match!
They deserve to be trending #1..... not WAP
such a dope song but the suits remind me of Yoda....must be the collars.
It’s insane that this song is nearly a 10 and I know these guys can do better
Bruno Mars LOVE 💓 Song Rules the Grammys 💞💕
This jam is everything!!! reminds me of real old school music & I am not sure if Bruno Mars has ever sounded better....love it!
I love this joint so freaking much!!
Yo where the fuck was Bruno for the past 36,000 years
Awesome performance,  awesome song!  Love the old school vibe!  Takes me back!  Whew!
this performance was FLAWLESS!!!!! Cannot stop watching 😩their voices complement each other  perfectly
This was flawless!!! Love it!
My fave performance of the Grammys!  That sexy sound of 70’s soul slow jams - complete with the 3 piece bell-bottom suits, the choreography and the disco lighting!  Bruno Mars has the most heavenly voice - and the harmony at the end!  Echoes of the Delfonics, the Chi-Lites, the Main Ingredient.  Sooo SMOOOOTH!
I did not know Anderson Paak could sing like that🔥🔥🙌🏾
I feel like I’m watching a performance on Soul Train! Where is Don???? Wow they all sound amazing! I didn’t know Bruno teamed up with a group!
How come not to hook some babes with this song 🎶 🎵
❤️ yeah this going on my play list for hubby
Deepfake Bruno.
Yes!! You fellas sound so good. This sounds like 90's r&b. I can listen to you guys all day. U betta sang Bruno and Andersen. Nice!!!
If you haven't seen Anderson Paaks' Tiny Desk, shame on you!
The best performance of the night !!
Romans 5:8 But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Romans 10:9-10 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Romans 10:13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.
Wish they would of played instruments for this performance..
In love. 🤍
THIS SONG WOULD’VE FIT PERFECTLY TO THE GET DOWN!!! Netflix was so ugly for ending it so soon
🥰🥰🥰🥰 The pure sound of sweet lovin 🥰🥰🥰🥰
Love love love love ❤️
Love Bruno 💋
this was the definition of an INSTANT classic. I think everyone is in agreement of its greatness
I'm glad these two finally worked together. If anyone can bring us pure happiness, its a collab from Silk Sonic. This song has been on repeat since day 1
Music worth listening to, Love Bruno  Mars!!!!
I love it !!!!
This my song
Omg I’m so in love with this song 🎶 ♥️
He got that haze and filets 🖤💜🖤💜🖤
I'm slow dancing with myself....THIS song moves me so much. The culture approves.
I LOOOOOOOVE when the live is better then the original. They killed this shit. Grammys should be absolutely ashamed to overlooking them to perform.
Yassssss🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
remember America how to use oils price destroy Russia economy!  we can do the same use oils price stop buying oils destroy America economy!
Wish all R&B still had the 70s vibe. This is why I fux with Bruno
When I heard Anderson .Paak on Dr. Dre's Compton album that's when I knew he was something special
One of the best if not the best Grammy performance I’ve seen in my life
I love how Ole school this is....when men sang beautiful lyrics of love...refreshing...
I absolutely love this!!!! 😍💥❤
These are the vibes I need in my life, going forward 🔥
I want a whole album dammit! Damn c@ckteasing me with one damn song 🎵
Love the song. This my shit. I like the video with them playing instruments. 😍💜💜💜💜😍
I'm in love with music all over again..even your grandma could jam to this 😍
This is everything!
Usher dropped the ball Michael left for him and Bruno Mars picked it up. My my my, and let's not mention how Reuben Stoddard fumbled what Luther left him. 🤔
Modern r&b be like..
Now this is real music.
Dese niccas ruthless
THE AUDACITY
Never heard Anderson songs before but babyyyy this thang been on repeat for dayss
❤️♥️🔥🔥
I like this better than the actual video
my hooouusssee clean...-that part got some chills up my arms....I want to sing that to all my ladies..:)
Baby it was the ...way they raised that right arm with that hip rock....for me YASSS SILK SONIC Bring that real music back and leave that door open OKAYYYY!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
RIP to my father! He would have absolutely loved this!! Reminds me of 70’s soul groups
All I can say is Uuh UuH UuH. You can bite if you want......
🍾🥂
Wait. I love the song and music. Having a VERY difficult time looking at 70's styles here. 😱 is disco the next thing?....
Beautiful
Welp thanks to Bruno I need a mop for this wet and gushy!💦
Sweetttttttt mother soooo gooodddd
Bruno is the brother no one hates lol :D <3
Uptown Saturday night remake?
I have to listen to this song at least twice a day!  Job well done.  Oh and I love love you Bruno❤️❤️❤️❤️🖤🖤🖤
This should give the world hope that the music industry still believes in harmonies and filter free vocals! 🙌🏼👏🏼🙌🏼👌🏼 More please!!!   Welcome back Bruno!  Anderson Paak we hear you sir!
3:06 can someone tell me the note bruno is hitting here!! My god I love that part!!!
AZUL 🐦
Amazing. Y’all about to destroy the summer. Both voices sounded so good
daaaaayum, I love the live version. this song has been stuck in my head for weeks since I first heard it. Now it lives there haha
you guys are amazing the scammys didn't deserve you
the government doesn't care your life the government only care rich life!  and rich only care money!  so how to destroy rich!  economy crisis!
Bruno will NEVER disappoint 🥵
If you haven’t seen him in concert go now ! Best concert ever I have seen him twice !
wow, great, sounds like early Motown, so smooth
This Grammy video needs to replace the actually real video. Damn they killed the performance..
Dis dat shit that made us 80’s babies!!!
I like,l it , I like it,I like it😊I ❤️u Paak⭐️
I love how old school they took it!!!
Wow 😳 literally amazing! Gave me chills❤️👏
Wow 😳 literally amazing! Gave me chills❤️👏
Best song and performance of the evening.
💕Bruno
they are a match made in musical heaven omg i’m so excited to see what they do with their band!!!
Love this song and performance! Wow!
Everything about this performance was flawless😭🥺💗❤️ omgggggg I can’t
Y'all must don't know about Cheeky Andy!! These two are walking legends.
I have not stopped playing this yet ✨🖤✨
So pretty much the best Grammy's performance but without a crowd f*** man can you imagine being in that crowd
These two together 🔥🔥🔥🔥
he said he got filets 😂😂😂
If you don’t like this music “Shut your mouth”
How the hell do you sound better than the recording. Its like they did a remake of their own original song.  Genius.
👍Sounds good. Nice song. 💝 I must be really “out of touch” because the only person I know singing is Bruno Mars. 😆😂
The Grammys suck but their album better win next year because we know it’s getting nominated
🔥🔥🔥🔥amazing!!! Anderson held it dowwwwnn!!! My bad for forgetting 😅😩
Wow omg this performance is the best I’ve seen in a very long time!  This song is everything right now. I can’t wait for the entire album to drop.
this is funny for me
The best performance of that night 👍🏽👍🏽
Very reminiscent of the old-school male groups....I love it!
👍😍I love this retro thing💝
Bruno has the midas touch for real... Every song he touches is gold. From back to his early days with Grenade, and doing the chorus for lighters for eminem. Now transitions flawlessly too a more classic 70s sound. Absolute legend. Definitely a GOAT. 🐐🐐🐐
always happy to see Anderson .Paak get recognition... found him from a fuckin it g ma mix
I’m telling my kids this is the Temptations
This is a real performance, like legit amazing. It's sad to think that the grammys would feature this and WAP in the same show.
The reason this music sounds sooo good, and it is good, most of todays artists can’t sing. Excellent job gentleman!
MANNNNNNN whewww I'm so in love with this cut... This some Chil-ites Dramatics kinda ISH grown folk music... lemme get my Brass Monkey,  joint and roach clip😍😍😍🤩🤩🤩
anderson paak. never disappoints, its like he one ups himself everytime he performs man
This is a vibe
Just Drop The Mike!
Such an insane performance! Better than their studio version! Love how they improvised some notes and made it even better! And both voices really complemented each other so good! And every time Bruno did his falsetto, it was so smooth! For me, definitely the best performance of the night!
Perfect all the time
Hands down this was the best Grammys performance ever 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Bruno Mars is genuinely so talented ✨
They killed it 🔥🔥🔥
If the opportunity doesn't knock build a door.....
When all you can do is sit and watch.
They gotta perform next super bowl.
Bruno def helped dude get smooth.. Bruno should've don't this song himself
My Hooouuuuse clean
They are giving it their all like their not OGs in the game. I love it... That's all a fan ever wants to see.
This is definitely going on our playlist for roller coaster road trips. 💯
They need to get Akeem Ali on the remix
My new favorite song🎵🎶🎵🎶💜💜
🔥🔥🔥
I ain’t did nothing replay this performance all day
These niggas too smooth I love it
When your thought process to add a comment goes away because he’s just that amazing. 😳
The BOOTSIE shades for the stamp🤩🤩🤩
Yes! Real music!!
imma be honest, I thought that was Weeknd (without facial hair) who introduced em
We haven't heard the album yet and I'll be mad if they don't get album of the yr or SONG of the yr in 2022
I am totally digging this 70/80s vibes. Just good OLD time 👌
This is the sexiest sh** since D’Angelo’s How Does it Feel.
Days been better since he's back <3
WHAT?!? I’m speechless
Hell yeah 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Bruno might be one of the most talented singers ever
Bruno has definitely went down hill his last good song was locked out of heaven
Hands down, one of the best R&B songs in the last decade
¡DAAAAAAAMN! , thats it.
Oh my God  The stylistics😂❤️❤️❤️Love it classic style music ,, very 1970s🌙💫⚡️✨🌟✨⚡️✨💫⭐️ The only classy thing of the night
Aliens: "What is music?" Me: *plays this

Switch
Silk Sonic: Imma leave the door open Smooth: Fa sho
Bruno makes this song 🖤🖤
DAMN, sending chills down my back.
Good performance..I most definitely would have rather seen THE WEEKND..but we know how that turned out
After watching this for the umpteenth time😁😁😁 - I  realized I didn't give the brothers in the background some love❤❤ - they were hanging right w/Bruno & Anderson with the steppin & background vocals!!! Complete package!!!❤
Bruno is not Black.
That outro was so hot
I love you!!!
Heck yes! So good to see some music that’s based on just good song.
Sounds just like the song ❤
Flawless VOCALS....
At least they sound good. Kinda lame though. Extremely uncreative. Rather see the OG’s do this. Proves that music today sucks balls.
D a mn
This is timeless real music this is what my ears long for #Infinity #Timeless #forever music!
Who else doesn’t give a fuck about the Grammys?
Man,I'm speechless 😶 I can say honestly I wasn't surprised of bruno's vocals,but,this performance was so,so,amazing.Everything about it was so mesmerizing and entertaining,classical,and then those vocals,both guys killed it.I adore bruno mars he reminds me vocally of Michael Jackson,and he just melts your heart.And not gonna even mention how sexy and cute he is and then 🙃🤗😜 Loved it and best performance for me.
DYNAMIC-DUO......I 💘 it. 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Man this is what ENTERTAINMENT is all about at it fullest!!! Now as for the people that gave this video a thumbs down I want you to get in a real quiet people, dim the lights, put on whatever that b***s***  is yall call music and choke the s*** out your self. F*** you mean this ain't grooving?
Go head now. The days when men put on a suit and begged for the loving. I love this song. You can keep this on repeat.
My door is open..😌
THIS IS THE BEST NEXT DYNAMIC DUO SINCE NXSEUDE! FIGHT ME LOL
Didn't know Bruno could sang sang ❤💞
Bruno mars reminds me of Michael Jackson the passion their voices have❤
This song gives me Bobby Womack Vibes 🤫🤗😍
Nice Record !!!!!
Incredible performance 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Thb didn’t think I would seen Bruno this year but man am I glad I did😭 Also this literally sounds like they used auto tune😲✨
Beautiful song R&B is alive and thriving

Omarion? 😅
My two fave fucking artist finally collabed and could it get any better!!!!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥  It did the live version killed the original!!!!!
The choreography, vocals, suits, it allllllll
3:22 is the best part.
Thanks for taking me back to MOTOWN. ❤️
Flawless.
oh gracious me
If they make an album and it gets snubbed next year, I'm going to find one of the Grammys committee members and fight them in the street.  Don't ya'll do it!  This was all the way correct and I'm excited for this....yes, yess, yesss!
The Motown vibes are drippin!!! Perfection!!! 🔥🔥🔥
Everything.
That Sigma/Philly Sound ... love it!!!
Wow.....just 😳 wow!!!! 🙌🏾 👏🏾
let somebody know that the people in Arizona aligned are doing fraudulent on me and alias is on me they're trying to hide me so they can keep all my money and not let us do what we got to do I got charisma to do in the f****** holding me back all the time I've been trying to leave but I still need everything from me I need somebody to come
Major Temptations vibes. The mic switch was what the Temps used to do since almost all 5 of them originals used to sing lead.
Bruno I want to make it to the moon can you have somebody hit up the seal please cuz they stole my seal from down here when I was in Texas to Arizona I am Rosa I am the number one from the music on the money flow go over go on the road all around the world to come back to steal some home I got the three kids of the Saavedra Rose and I got my brother Rosa and Carlos

Omfgggg bruno mars voice is so perfect his vocals his voice is all perfect
If this was all the Grammys had, then it's a shame, because good music like this isn't what the current slate of Grammy nominees and winners are about. Amazing.
Yaaaaasssssssss uninterrupted😍
THEY WERE ALL SO IN SYNCCC 😻😻💕
Has that classic feel that takes me back to good times...Well done👍🏽 Flawless performance..

This is the hit of 2021 so far.  Anyone who don't love this has no Soul, no Rhythm, no Style and don't know good music.  Can't wait to see them in concert.
Love the throwback vibe of this awesome song 🎵
He got fish fillets from mickey dz
Bill burr & Bruno Mars w/ Anderson is definitely the best thing that happened to the Grammys

How many babies 9 months from now are gonna be named silk and/or sonic thanks to these two? 🤔😬
Absolutely amazing chills😪
I don't think we've seen Bruno this 70s since "Treasure" came out
Y’all rockin with the new Bruno Mars ⁉️
So, we going to act like that ending didn’t just happen😳
The temptation vibes. Love it! Truly amazing 🤩
Go Demarcus! Go Demarcus!
Bruno Mars reminds me a little bit of Sammy Davis Junior !! He looks a little bit like him.
Magical
I can't take how smooth this song is
The abounding walk accordantly trick because pig infrequently phone mid a fabulous garage. roasted, outrageous asphalt
That boy good.
Nothing makes more sense than this
There’s a Ron Burgundy feels with this song esp the “I look too good to be alone”.
They remind of the 70’s .  Great decade for music.
OMGGGGGG YEYYYY
Wow i love this so much
I’m loving this style! 🙌🏻✊🏾👏🏼👌🏿🤙🏽
Aye these 2 guys top of the line pay these dudes perfect link big tunes

One of the best performances of the night.  Dua Lipa was the other one.
THEY SHOULD HAVE WON A TROPHY AWARDED FOR T.V. BEST PERFORMANCE SONG FOR BEING CLEAN AND FAMILY WHOLESOME PERFORMANCE!
giving me O'Jays, not quite there but they reaching!
if my man don't sing like this, I don't want him!!!
Silk Sonic at it's truest! Perfect name for the perfect sound🔥🔥🔥

SO CLASSIC OOOOOO YASSSS
SEXYSEXYSEXY🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥. Retro perfection.
The camera effects were SO clean and old school.
How can Brunos voice be getting better!!!??? This song is everything...
I can’t even tell you how many times I have watched this performance. I am so obsessed. Literal perfection
They out here getting panties and draws wet.
Now THAT was exciting. Took me back to the groups like Atlantic Starr, Blue Magic, Chi-lites, and the like. There should always be a market for this.
those collars could poke your eyes out, and I'm here for it
magical asf
Please bring this back young people .
Utter. Perfection... and I need those heart ❤️ glasses
Smart move to campaign for yourselves to be on the Grammys.  Very smart!  And great song!
Yesss! R&B is back!  Oh how I have missed you!
My first time hearing this song and I love it.
They bought that old-school flavor and did it well. Real doo-wop.

All I can say is FIRE!
Awesome reminds me of the old school days love songs classy
They should've given them next year's grammy last night.
I hope Anderson will never get slept on
I’m so in love with this song...have it on repeat! ❤️
Yo this is Their first song together and their first live performance together. What in the world. If this is supposed to set the bar for what’s to come, I really don’t think I’m ready for all that fire.
Anderson and Bruno are that thing missing in music today, a feeling you couldn't put your finger on until now.
Falalalalala.lalalan 🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤 y’all slay, slay, slay ‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
When you have to beg to perform 😂
They need a singer with a deep voice to add to the old school vibe.
2:15 the best note you feel his energy
What happened to the 5th guy
Damn Bruno does not need auto tune auto tune needs Bruno
Could not stop smiling! This warms my heart so much!
Love 😍
Actual talent here unlike Cardi B
The best damn performance I ever seen not a stain on it
Anderson Paak  and Bruno Mars 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Anderson .Paak is wicked good.
Nice to see the 70s back....love this

Coolio
1½ Words: Killt-it!
Yes yes 🔥👑👑👑💯💯💯😘 you cannot lie this was giving me old school but with new school

And yet WAP won song of the year. What happened to this type of music?
Love everything about this!!
I think many children were conceived after watching this video!  😂😂😅😂
Yall did y'all thang. I got an idea tho. Childish Gambino an also Anthony Hamilton would be a very nice collaboration added to the Silk Sonic, that's fpr sure. Plz one time.
Great performance love Bruno
Got to say Bruno Mars try a be Crown New King see you Bruno amazing Talent
And THIS is a completely different flavor than the other vid! Hot damn!

I could watch this a million times and it wouldn’t be enough 😍
Who the f××k disliked this performance..  It was Damn near perfect
Bringing back ole school RB LOVE ❤️ IT
After the first listen, this is my new favorite song. Classic. Straight From the Golden era of good music.
Perfection 👌💜💜💜
3:41 shamone over! 🤣 🤣 🤣 My fav part!!!
Love the throwback r&b feel.   SN: Bruno giving Tony Stark vibes with the shades.
Suits are giving me George Benson, Barry White vibes👍🏼
Anderson vocally stepped up for this performance
Does this song make anyone else wanna throw their panties at the tv?😂😂😂
I will leave my door open to them anytime.
This shit is magic
Lovr it.  Love the old school vibe!   This is real fab vocals!  Way to go!!!!
Bruno Mars was born in the wrong timeline. Back then, he would've been straight up competition for Smokey & the Temptations
The 518 people who disliked this performance are crazy! All I need is my dad's old El Camino and an open highway!😍
I've been playing this song everyday since I first heard it. Issa whole bop!!! I'm copping this album.
Sooooo smooth I'm in love 😍
Oh My Lord!!!! Can we PLEEEASSE BRING THIS KIND OF MUSIC BACK TO STAY???? Classic!!! I LOVE IT!!!💖💖💖
Such a great song and performance. LOVED IT!!!
Ahhh..brings back memories of those 70s groups..ChiLites, Stylistics, Ojays, Dramatics, Jackson5,
This has beenAnderson’s groove for a minute. He’s from another time
This is honestly one of the BEST PIECES that Bruno and Anderson has done
THIS SHYT SO HARD MAN 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bruno Mars been gone for so long he’s stuck in the 70’s now😂
Take notes people, this is a real performance
DAMN!!!
thank god for this song
Hello! I’m in love ❤️
Just give Silk Sonic the Album of year Grammy for 2022 please
So Bruno is in a band now?
Bruno Mars is a legend.
~ Yes Bruno Yes! Another stellar performance...Bruno & Anderson ... all the way deep!
Turn to Jesus Christ before its too late. Don't play with your eternal destination.
👂🏾: Damn son where you fine this
God, I was so into the song and I literally forgot to breathe. I’m too old to feel like this but Maybe music never too old.
I’ve loved Bruno since I was little his voice is amazing! I would cry if I ever met him in person❤️
I hate I missed this last night. I love this!
This good music right here.
This everything 🥰🥰🥰
Sorry young'n's this is music, find out about it.  Man I miss the true balladeers who can really sang.  This red light party in your parents basement  music we need more.
The "punch" Anderson Paak does at the end along with Bruno's swift "head turn" with the music made this even MORE classic! Like... I've seen this video 10 times in the past hour. Something amazing to find each time.  💯🖤🙏🏾
What did I just listen to... That was immaculate.
hey i’m back again
So smooth like butter 🧈🕺🏽🕺🏽🔥🔥
The switch was so SMOOTH! Ahhhh so amazing. You NEVER disappoint Bruno. No matter what 😊
This is everything! Wow just wow!
I'm in love with this! Soul Train vibes <3
to think...this is the same night they did wap.
Best performance of the night
Like back in the days

Bruno once again deserves best entertainer of the year. Beautiful song. SEXY! 😍
I enjoyed this performance of Bruno Mars and his new group Silk Sonic last night's Grammy Award that I waited for the rerun so I can watch it again.  Bruno Mars and his group are decent in their outfit that I admired them for that not to mention the melody of the song.  I simply love it and I'll buy the song at Apple iTune so I can listen to it before I go to bed.
Beautiful voices 🙌🙏💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
That "Woo woo woo woo woo woo woo woo woo" kills me EVERYTIME.
3:31
Bruno looking like Bobby DeBarge
Love Both of them Separately especially Anderson Paak.  Bruno is just super talented vocally🤩😇,too see them do this Music thing together is just amazing.   Luv luv love , I love them. Where do I grab that SilkSonic merch😍😎
Song brings me back to the soul groups of the 1960's and 1970's such as , The Delfonics, The Stylistics and the Spinners, etc. The outfits fit that era. These guys get it, way better then the music they put out today.!!
outstanding

Hes MJ Bad🕺
Anderson could make an album straight like this and it would be legendary. Add Bruno Mars to the album goodness......
How can there possibly be dislikes? They killed this. The live version was more impressive than the audio which is INCREDIBLE!!
THIS PERFORMANCE INSTANTLY CHANGED MY MOOD, WHERE IS MY MAN THAT SHOULD BE SINGING THIS TO ME????👀👁🥰😍😍😍😍😍😍😘😘😘😘😘😘
the way it just sounds so clear and effortless. amazing.
okaaaay when Paak came in @1:32 🔥😫

WHAT A MFKIN DUO!!! I NEED THIS EVERYDAY OF MY LIFE!
Bruno Baby*
💖💖💖
Im a leave the door open*:-)

High class music and musician

If this is your first exposure to Anderson, then y'all need to get your musical priorities straight.
Dayummmm!!!...them boysssss gooddd!...💯💯🔥🔥... I been tell’em Pakk!!!💯💯🔥🏆
I NEEEED THIS TOOOOOOUR!!!!!!!!!!
We are watching a living legend
Holy. Shit.
This reminds me so much of Mowtown performances but modernized.
THIS is the music I grew up listening to! Such talent in this production!!!
🥰🥰🥰
THIS. IS. MUSIC.
They ATE and left no crumbs! These guys sung their faces OFF🙌🏾🙌🏾🤩🤩😍😍
significado de perfección:
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
It sounds even better live!!!!
🔥🔥🔥
AOTY next year, just wait.
That Clean Smooth Ol'Skool singing without auto-tuned voice over👍🏿
That Eb5 note that Bruno hits on the word "want" at 3:20... WOW. Just wow.
They ate that
Awesome bro Good job
This 70-80’s style treasure is just giving me life and love👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Yessss the old heads love this
Anderson had the nerve to hit his falsetto in that second verse. The audacity. These two are unstoppable. He played a bit of the intro to the album on his IG story. The album is going to be ridiculous. And Bruno will either outsing your favorite artist or outdance them. Or both.
Somebody grandma was reminiscing back to that "man" in 1971. I'm in my 40's and I want to go back to the Future and be grown! Wooh! Black Grease! Somebody make Black Grease on Broadway or movie please!
Bruno te amo
That smooth 70's vibe
HE GOT FILETS
People really are just getting into Anderson.Paak...he's been amazing!! These 2 together are magical!
Nice Ol' School Vibe... Snap, spin...hands in the air...Oh yeah. Y'all did that!
Paying homage to old-school black performers. Great job!!
These brothers are smooove wit it!!!
one thing bruno mars is gonna do is sing tf outta his songs, ugh I love him .
If it wasn't those two I would swear this wasn't live, that's how perfect it is
The fact that this is a complete serenade without the use of profanity, and to top it off with the discreet overtone of the hidden agenda. The melody, lyrics are just smooth like butter. I can't get enough of this song!!!
Everything about this performance and song is flawless. Anderson Paak, Bruno Mars, and all the Vocslist, instrumentalist and choreographers that contributed to the creation of this masterpiece. You really brought MUSIC back and did what music should do to people. You took us on a musical journey of the highest capacity with this masterpiece. Amazing live performance. This is how real musicians and real talent should be. Wonderful job to all of you who created this fantastic work. It will be on my playlist one repeat for a long time. 😍❤️😍
I'm glad he's back making music ❤we've missed you!!!
Anderson Pak remind of Dave Chappelle if Dave could sing. Its the mannerisms.
Love this ole school vibe yes Real R&B best Performance in years I don't watch the Grammy's anymore but this Was so good 😘😘
HE IS ONE OF THE GREATEST THANK YOU FOR MUSIC BRUNO ...BLESSINGS TO EVERYONE MAY YOUR SUCCESS CONTINUES💗💗💗💗👐👐👐🙋
Motown vibes coming through! The Temptations, The Stylistics, ALL my parents’ favorites!
This sounds amazing. I can't stop playing it.. guess I gotta do a cover on my saxophone Definitely someone is getting pregnant to this.
Yaaaaaaaaaaas!!!!!! Ya'll came through and pulled up!!! 🙌
as a 21 year old man who doesnt listen to oldies I mainly listen to new age rap I really enjoy this song
Vocals, Choreography on point. Gave me that MJ Rock with You/Don't Stop Til You Get Enough Video feel
damn!!! they took me back to the '70's!!! "tell me that your coming thru"....
This performance and combination is so smooth and perfect. ❤
That performance was sweet and🔥.😆❤❤❤
We need more of this  Thank you the song is awesome and the choreography brings back lots of memories of 4 tops, temptations, etc.
Loved this performance! 👏👏👏👏👍👍👍👍
Truly amazing 🔥 🔥
Now y’all can stop sleeping on Anderson Paak man is a creative genius. Bruno is a true gem
I'm sorry - if you gave this a thumbs down, you don't recognize artistry
Anderson wore his heart shades better than Elton John's. 👓
Everything about this is on point. Fine point. Everything. Love it.
Bruh we need him at the Super Bowl halftime show again
When history repeats itself in the best way possible. I absolutely love this vibe.
They cold
Real talent here! Love the70s vibe all over this!
😍😍😍
Performance!
Is this lip synced or live? It looks lip synced.
So delfonics good
IM SO GLAD YOU GOT TO PERFORM..THIS IS THE JAMMS
Oh Mylanta! <3
Anderson paak humming in the beginning made me think he did a twin swap with dave Chappelle lol great preformance!
Play this video at 144p

Anybody that tries to cover this song please don’t cause anything way you sing it will not do this song justice

YachtDammit this sh*t is the greatest sh*t to hit R&B in years.......and this performance should make some young folk fall back in love with true music
They sound just as amazing live 😭
This is real music.. yup yup
R&B at it's PUREST!!!!!  This song is INSANE!!!! Reminds you of R&B in the 70's, 80's, 90's
even though they're all dressed the same, the talent shines through!! Love this.
I am sooo getting Bobby Debarge from Switch with Bruno's new look..the stache!  Also that smooooth voice. Performances by all were perfection old school style.  Loved it!
other than BTS, this was BY FAR the best performance of the night.  I have watched about 20 times and I just cannot stop.  this is exceptional and this is what the Grammys are about.  Thank you do much Bruno and Anderson.  You have restored my faith in the music industry.
I'm convinced Bruno is actually Blanket. #BabyMJ
I love a good harmony.
Incredible
👏🏿👏🏿
ALOHA NUI LOA BRUNO! Hawaii LOVES YOU! This is a Ballad so wonderful, worthy of number ones all over the planet. This is a group worthy to be the new IT! This rivals Frank Sinatra, Elvis, Michael and so many 50/60's groups... AKUA, this is a GREAT SONG! Gonna be like ONE! Mahalo, Mahalo nui loa! This is what SOUL is supposed to sound like. SO YOUR OWN SOUL LEAPS OUT OF YOU AND WANTS TO RUN INTO YOUR BED! You guys got this!
This almost sounds like it should be a Motown Classic!!!!!!! That’s how good it is!
You don’t like this performance? Shut yo goddamn trap
This song is so good it appeals to multiple generations.
0:16 0:27. Use me as a replay button
Hot hot hot!
Love this!!!!!! Loved his tribute to Little Richard also!
478 people have no damn taste in music lol oh shit i accidently disliked it😅 *relike
This will be cool if he wasn’t lip-synching
Glad they are bring back love songs the world needs more of this kind of music.I think it will help people be kinder to eachother.
I don’t know how they’ve done it, but this live version is better than the studio release. Holy cow...
Trust me. Ain't noone in the hood leaving a door open. 😂
Bruno so talented
Flawless! Always a believer! Thank you for this beautiful song . All of them are so in sync . The harmony is so magical 😍 It’s just too beautiful! ❤️❤️❤️
I believe Bruno Mars since 2010 has been responsible for the baby population
Yes! I missed Bruno’s voice so much.
How is this any different than "Baby It's Cold Outside"??? O wait...it's 100% the same song. I love being right all the time.
Never thought it could get better than the music video. They DID THAT!!!
Why was this so smooth. U see how on point everyone was 🔥🔥🔥
Paak giving me those “ ain’t nobody here to see you Otis “ vibes
This is magical ✨
Silky smooth perfection!
The duet you never thought you needed in your life
So incredibly talented. Swagger!!!
😍😍😍
OMG 😳 😱🙌🏾💪🏾🔥
Wow 🤩
Love this song! And theses two are music gold!
This isn't getting enough HYPE!!!!
is it just me or does the ending from anderson remind anyone of that one "go demarcus" video
Those that dislike this video are the ones that would get the Lay's (like i originally thought they said) while the rest of us enjoy the filets shortly after the people haze! #RealMusic
Real Music...! #GrownFolk
do I hear Grammy's sweep 2022? another #1 - this is 🔥
We got a lot of Bruno Mars comments, but ANDERSON PAAK IS HOLDING HIS OWN VOCALLY WITH BRUNO AND THAT IS NO EASY TASK!!!
I thought he said, "If you're hungry, I got the Lays."
I am in aww with this performance #flawless❤
❤❤❤ Loving Silk Sonic! Bruno😍
And live as well. Lol
Perfection ✨ can’t wait to see you live again 😭💕
Amazing 🤩

SCREAAAMMIINNGGG 🗣🗣🗣 what a phenomenal performance!!! 🤩👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾

Best performance. Need that energyyyy
What a legend, one of the rarest artist that doesn't use autotune
Yep, brought me back to the late 70's very, very early 80's. Jr. High and Freshman & Sophomore year...the Vibes!  Love this!! 😍
I don't have time for the legit stress these 2 are putting on my heart but somehow I'm making time for it lol

History repeats itself.... LoL
#LetSilkSonicThrive

If you don't like this song you are simply a hater!
Bruno’s voice just takes me to another world 🤗😅❤️❤️❤️
So ¿You didn't watch the Grammys? ... here's is it, everything you wanted to see.
Loved it. So wonderfully old school.
Oh so they FULLY snappt
Instantly became my Fav Jam😍
This is fire
YAAASSSSSSS
Come on O'Jays feelings....
Another Hit for the Radio💖💖💖
OMG

This just gave me chills. I love that old school sound. Plus Bruno can sing to me anytime. His voice is everything.
This should be illegal
I love this. The old school vibe is everything
OMG.Bruno has a voice from heaven
Fire.  I love Bruno.  He's not afraid to be different.  He's a trend setter.
That's how its done
Best performance of the Grammys hands down 👊🏾🤟🏾
I cried real tears oh my god

Smoothest silkiest vocals out there!🤩🤩 I love that Anderson paak is getting huge recognition too now
Can’t wait for them to go on tour 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yes Lawd!!!!
Bruno Mars is a stand out in this group no doubt Beyoncé
💗
This is perfection at its finest.. true artist beautiful imagery.. took me to a time where I wish I was growing up.. love his art
I luv it!
I really keep putting this song🎶 “over and over” and during quarantine I thought he’s not gonna make music anymore buttttttttttttttttt.... he said like “HELLO WORLD”🕴🏻🕺🏻
That ending thooooooo
Better than the recorded version on Spotify
Bruno got that Marvin Gaye sway! It's not up for debate.
This and Poppy's pre-Grammy's performance is EVERYTHING
YES YES YES
Bruno Mars's voice is everything! 😘
I guess for the time being I can say that they still make music like they use to. This is old School all the way.
This is precisely what we needed. The old school vibe has been sorely missed and these two are perfection! ❤️❤️
If you are reading this and you are sad and/or depressed know that Jesus Christ brings deep happiness and fulfillment. No amount of alcohol, drugs, or sex can bring as much happiness as Jesus can. Invite Him into your heart and be born again. Read the New Testament in the Bible and meditate on the scriptures. The joy won’t come immediately but once it comes it’ll flow like a river. It always comes as long as you don’t give up in seeking God. Weeping and sorrow may come at night but joy comes in the morning. God bless
Music industry take notes
i smiled the whole time omfg i’m so glad he’s back
This has been my fave song since it came out but this performance.....  😭😭😭👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 just beautiful!  I love EVERYTHING about this!
Cool video y'all got here today silk sonic
....
Teddy Pendergrass: Close the door Bruno: Imma leave the door open
0:55 ok but can we talk about that smooth ass spin😍🔥
Oh I'm coming through
Best part of the Grammys
The fact that Anderson went to a high school down the street from my high school.... crazy
Loved this performance. Anderson can do no wrong!
Man I love the old school feel of this. This is something we needed! Great job to them!
Why the hell is Drake not at the Grammy’s

IMMACULATE! THE VIBES! THE OUTFITS! CHEFS KISS ALL AROUND!!!!!!!!!!
I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS
We all have been waiting for him to upload a song. Cant prove me wrong
When does this album come out???
I LOVE BRUNO MARS, THIS SONG IS ALL THAT!!!!! BRINGS ME BACK WHEN REAL BANDS PLAYED, I WAS A TEENAGER IN THE 70'S AND THIS SONG IS LIKE BACK IN THE DAY. DON'T STOP MAKING REAL MUSIC BRUNO I BEG YOU, DON'T EVER STOP WITH YOUR SMOOTH VOICE. LOVE IT!!!
Reminds me sooo much of “ our “ music. The Stylistics , Delfonics , Blue Magic etc. Luv this. Thank You 😍
Lip-Synced but still a great performance.
No words♥️♥️🔥🔥
Damn Bruno is short 😂
This is some “Switch” Harold Melvin and the blue notes...my childhood ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Brothers killed this performance. Try still trying to bring it back to life.
Wow
They sound even better live 🤎
Is that Trevor Noah or The Weeknd hosting?
Daddy Bruno be packing 👀👀😏😏
Anderson and bruni are such a powerful duo together and its just blowing my mind
Usually I don't question Bruno's live performances because he's shown he can sing very good live, but here I believe he and Anderson are lip-syncing. Not so much an issue with Anderson with this, but Bruno's microphone just seem very far from his face a lot and yet he's singing rather clear. That should not be the case. And if he's lip-syncing then chances are Anderson is too.
First we had The Stylistics.. now the Silk Sonic.
They killed it!
I can’t stop watching this.
This literally sounds the same  on the track , amazing  !!!!!!!!!
THIS IS AN ENTIRE AND COMPLETE VIBE
😎 groove
anderson couldnt resist the whoop whoop part at the end... lol
Damn. The Weeknd took an L this year. I forgot Bruno was the Goat
Everything about this is awesome. The outfits, the theme, the vocals, just 😽🤌
Perfection. Definitely a beautiful vibe❤
These two were made to make music together, wow. Gotta talk about this on the next podcast episode
I Love this
the harmonies at the end wtffffff
I forgot how good Bruno sounds... and Mr.Pak whoa
Worth the wait. Love this.
This was such a well orchestrated performance! I enjoyed this sooooo much! So dope.
I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this song!❤❤❤  This is a beautiful song, with multi-talented musicians.❤❤❤👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽  Bringing back that old-school vibe.  I listen to this song mulitple times a day.  Executed very well!  #LoveSilkSonic❤❤❤👑 #LoveBrunoMars❤❤❤👑
Fire 🔥 🔥🔥. The next day and I'm  still mesmerized.  So talented.
True artistry 💯
I need this as a ringtone!  That old school vibe is fire!!🔥🔥🔥
Legendary
is bruno singing live or is it a track?
1:44 GOD DAMN! That was cleeeeeeean!
Oh yeah
Those hands swaying o the air have me all the vibes
Pure ecstasy 🎆
Why’d Bruno leave for so long we needed him. Loved this performance.
It's the "black girl right arm in the air with the body swingin and finger snappin to the beat bc this her song" in both cut and double time, takin me out lol. And that sequential spin Anderson and Bruno did leading into the chorus, the first time .... BAYBEE!!! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾  So groovy! So sexy! So smooth! So simple! So necessary #iLoveThis #CantGetEnough ❤❤🤪🤪
Perfection.
Killed it....just like I knew they would!!! 💜💜💜💜
Wow!!!!
WOW this version is even better than the single. Incredible
This is my favorite performance from the 63rd annual Grammy Awards, welcome back Bruno! 🕺🏾😎
Obsessed
They are so real! Real to the core! You go, smooth in the groove! HA! All those want to be's adhere! You can't  touch these Fine and Beautiful men! Pls, on a "serious note"! Pls, make sure that those in the Copy cat, music plagiarism, country don't steal and take credit, like they did Bobby Brown, Every Little Step I Take! They like the flavor but don't like the color! So sad  and Shameful! I wish You All Much Success! Make Your Move and Continue To Groove! ;   )
That transition from Anderson to Bruno at 0:54! Divine performance.
Love the ole school vibe. Great song,  thanks to Jurnee Smollett for introducing me to it.
3:21 Bruno really went the fuck in on this note man. Barely anybody singing his ass off like him right now!
The Best performance of the night!! This how it's done!! Take notes... Bruno Mars said pass me the mic I got this.🎤🎶❤️❤️❤️🙌🏼👏🏼🔥🔥🔥
OH MY GOD
Love it ♥♥♥♥
I'm  in love
Bruno said, "y'all thought me and the Hooligans were fire- Wait until you get a load of SILK SONIC!"
New song with a throwback vibe...love it!  Reminds me of the Stylistics.
this was absolutely so incredible they didn't need to use autotune their voices were so perfect.

Everyone should strive to song like bruno mars RN. U hit a high note like he did in the second hook, any woman would drop they panties lol
This whole performance giving me 1970-1980's vibes and I'm here for it🎶👏🏾🎤🎼🎥
God Bruno’s voice is literally like honey
My panties just melted right off into the oblivion...
Big Anderson Paak fan.  Nice collaboration with Mars.....
THEY KILLED THIS!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥
This is the song I’m going to be saying to my kids “What you know about this?!”
Clothes on and a awesome performance. 👌
😱😱😱 OMG !!!!!
Missed Bruno!
This performance was pure gold!!!
Sounds like so much of the music that I listened to when I was in high school in the '70s.
You saved the Grammys
Man , Such Prime Temptations Vibes 🔥 This Was Amazing
I never knew I needed a Bruno Mars & Anderson Paak album until just now
Just posted my REACTION to this performance 🔥 This song is my SHIT!!! 🔥
Real music...totally enjoyed the performance

STRAIGHT PERFECTION!!!
Just hand them the Grammy right now!!! These guys were excellent! The style, vibe, choreography, and the vocals!

Now this is a Grammy performance. Beautiful.
Holy shit....Silk Sonic is coming...no no...SILK SONIC HAD ARRIVED...and no one is ready for tha shit they bouta drop
Not them hitting notes 😏✋
Don't have this song play while I'm driving. On everything I love I sound just like this in the car.
Bruno Mars really made a stunning comeback

Giving me 5 heartbeats tease♡♡♡
Dang they good

❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤Can't get enough
THIS SONG
AMAZING
Those dance moves tho!!
👏👏👏👏👏👏 👏 💐 💐 💐 💐 💐 💐  💐 LOVE THIS!!!!
this is how the original should’ve sounded lol
been HOW THEY WOULD PERFORM THIS SONG thinking of the Stylistics, the Floaters, the Manhattans, etc., and GOSH DAMN they exceeded my expectations with this 1st live performance.
Wow! dang Bruno heck yeah
IMMA LEAVE THE DOOR OPENNN ✨✨✨
This is my jam currently
I am feeling nothing but good vibes with this song & performance was on point!
Top quality production here, nicely done
The vibe is perfect when you watch this in 144p
This. Is. My. Jam!
This performance was just flawless ✨
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💜
They sang their tails off! Loved every minute of their performance! And Bruno did a fantastic tribute to little Richard ♥
this is so fricking good
That Ole Old School feel still does it for me. Loved the performance❣️
I miss music with real instruments. We don't have that much now.
Bruno is a method singer he dives into the style and seriously he's touching icon status
He started off describing me😂🤭
I miss this old school vibe. Yassss!! Loving it.
damn
Paak has my favorite Tiny Desk for a reason, but to add Bruno?! 🥵🥶
Man Bruno is my guy but more of these comments need to show Anderson Paak respect. He’s one of the best artist in the game rn. Bruno knows, but some of his fans are sleeping hard.
just listened again and got chills... again
I don't know what people are talking about when they say he's culturally appropriating. I'm a black man, growing up I listened to Michael Mcdonald/D.B's, Bobby Caldwell, Hall &Oates and I remember my parents and relatives (all black except for an aunt) rockin' to their music and were happy to claim some funky white dudes as their own. We also listened to  The Temps, The Whispers (my favorite), Stylistics, Delphonics, Sly and the Family.. etc..  I have yet to see anyone emulate these greats but only a few. Bruno Mars is one of them. I see him as a person who grew up listening to and loving the same music as I did and he's doing this so we don't forget about an era known for putting out the music that everyone samples, the music that shaped many of today's stars, the music that played in the background as our parents fell in love with each other. Music with a real BAND! What I consider REAL MUSIC... Thanks for keeping beautiful music alive Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak.
I adore this!
Best live performance ive ever heard everyone else has shorted breath notes and voices sound different these guys sound the same even better live then the music video
i don't know how i'm supposed to wait for this album
Just ripping off the 70s and the millies ,gen z and all the alphabet soup don't even know. They should be sued. Sucks ballz!
So 70's!!!! Love it!
Yes 👏🏽
Hi
Omfg I NEED THIS FUCKING ALBUM
Clearly the song of the year!!
Sheeeeeshhhh is all I can say🤯
can we release this version on streaming sites too PLEASE it just cleared my skin
Go head Bruno!!!!!!  Sang that shit!
You two need to do another song together
2021 SOTY
Yeesss Bruno and Anderson!
The fact that they can sound THIS good LIVE is just...I'm speechless😩❤️✨💯
Bruno is the only person who is taking the dullness and darkness out of the sound of music these days and keeping the energy alive we need more people like him this was awesome...
🤸‍♀️❤️🌹
Bruno Mars is this generation El Debarge. He can sang..not just sing. This is perfection!
This is literal perfection
I think we all needed this to happen and I'm so glad soul music came back into mainstream....
Im pregnant
Don’t play w/ silk sonic they’ll moonwalk all over u fools
Love Bruno Mars and this performance
silk sonic is just what the world needs rn
It is a combination of The Temptations and Glady’s Knight and the Pips..I ❤️
Giving me treasure vibes
Seeing Bruno was my highlight!
The way Anderson says filets in this version makes me feel things
I would love to see Bruno and the legend El debate collaborate on a project together, think it would be awesome!!
Yes Lawd! Anderson.Paak carries this song
Real music is back. Thank you guys!
Waiting for our fav vocal coach to react to this
One Word: REPLAY
The best part of the grammys. Like no one came close to this performance.
This is some Dramtaics-Chi-Lights-Bloodstone-Blue Magic throw back!!
Me: LALALALALALAAAAAAAAA 🙋🏽‍♀️
Does it get any better than this...........
Now that’s music 🎵!!!!!💯👊🏾👊🏾
This song is feeding my soul.
Those eye glasses 👓😎 yes!
BRUNOS BACK  and Anderson bringing a different perspective
Ohhhh yesssssssss their voices collaborating is what we all needed
Im connected to Canada server through vpn to see this performance. Pls some one make these videos international.
Picture yourself standing in front of a mirror. Notice the negative labels that are placed on you. Remove the labels and replace them with a big sticker of a heart with angel wings.
I really don’t even know where to start with in writing this review. I worked with Tom of bitcoinsamurai and he literally worked his butt off to get me through the investment process as quickly as possible. When I wanted to withdraw i had a few hiccups but he stayed on top of it every single step of the way. He called, emailed, and texted me with updates to keep me reassured with all changes. I’m very impressed and satisfied with how everything turned out. Thank you Tom for all your help!
This is just perfect
Now I say I say That's uh dam fabulous performance all need to be said
Maaaaan! This is what's up!.
WOW! flawless performance! I feel the soul!
Wow! My man Bruno Mars came Back! Thank you God..I love you Bruno
I’m dumbfounded!
Anderson could easily be a top lyricist in the game. For some reason his pen game is underrated as a rap artist.  Yall gon respect the .GOAT ~  YES LAWD!
i’m convinced they just played to track it sounds so similar
Bruno’s voice gonna get me pregnant smh Lort have mercy!!
2021 the year of the Baby Boom, all thanks to the smooth talking crew  Silk Sonic
Lol I hear a lot of people saying they lipsync one thing about Bruno and his crew he never ever lipsyncs he’s a live performer he has never ever in his lifetime of performing he’s just that good and keeps his voice healthy
I love this so much ❤️ Bruno knew what to do, this has that old school feel to it
That’s what you call natural auto tune
I can't stop playing this music! Is perfect.
Love that Trevor Noah pronounces Andersons last name correctly.
Anderson Paak is AMAZING and let me tell you I didn’t think Bruno could sing that high but he proved me wrong. The harmony at the end is gorgeous.
Dem boys good!!! 👏🏾😁 #SexualChocolate
As someone from the golden age of R&B, who is the same age as MJJ and Prince, I'll say that Bruno Mars is the real deal. And Anderson Paak is a pleasant surprise.
😎😎😎
My new favorite song.
I don't understand the 400 dislikes. They obviously don't understand real music and real talent.
Yesssss 🔥🔥🔥🔥 the only ones who can bring the oldies sound to the current age yessss
Flawless
Absolute perfection
They knocked this out of the park. I can’t stop watching
This is literally my favorite song ever, even in a year I will ALWAYS love this
Yes please!! Are you kidding me... This is what I need 😍
Bruno out here looking like Sammy Davis 2.0! I'm here for it! 💯
bruno and anderson vocals r so fucking amazing and on point
Jessica is such a lucky woman. Bruno is a dream.
Bruno Mars I SWEAR your my IDOL! Please reply!
Love it. ❤️
Ate DOWN
Got me saturated asf                    And I’m a man
I couldn’t tell you one other thing about The Grammys...this was everything to me!
I don’t even know how many waves of chills I got during this
Ew, Trevor noah
1:06 GOD DAMN THAT WAS SO SMOOTH
If velvet, leather, silk, and other smoothest fabrics were to create a band, it would be these guys.
I didn't know how much we needed Bruno's 'why so serious?😝' demeanor. And Anderson's musical brilliance.
🔥🔥🔥
Bruno mars eres el mejor quisiera robarte esa voz jajajaj
I am so obsessed with this song...now I'm going to be listening  to this for an entire year, thanks Guys...thanks a lot...
Well damn.   I'm going to go take a cold shower now.
OMG, this is like 4:16s of vacation <3 I just love them
I love that you came back and then made something like this.......... just wow
Let me get my black on real quick! These ni$$az gonna f*ck around and save classic RnB!! Appreciate it Fellas!!
We so need this 2021 bring it back
This song was worth 2020 and covid altogether. I was thinking why they haven't done anything together back when 24K Magic was out. I The wait was so worth it. If perfect was a freaking song. I had to log in to my work account to write this. This song this group is everything 90's in 2021. Bruno Mars can sing about picking his butt and it would sell the same with Pak. There's no song in both these men catalog I don't like.
Maurice White easily if a movie is ever made
beggining until the end so f**k lit 🔥🔥🔥
Best performance of 2021. No one is gonna come close.
BEST PERFORMANCE OF THE NIGHT
I wish I could love this video a million times! 💞💞💞💞 Instead,  I shared it. 😍😘
I only watch the Grammys for this performance only then I turned it off because the rest was straight garbage !!!
.Paak singing his ass off just to keep up
DOPENESS
Pretty sure it's illegal to be THIS smooth...
wow
Yes Lawd!
What's old is new again... Love it!
Bruno is a true musician’s musician!!!
I'm so happy Bruno is finally back <3
Back to the 70   Whao i am glad  finally a little sould in the music world today Anderson is the new soul man
This song done got me pregnant
best performance of the night
Shamon!
Anderson was showing out!
this brings tears to my eyes it's so beautiful :,)
I am so in love with this song
Reminded me of Motown  and Bruno’s voice is like butter smooth!
Looks like 404 people want to leave the door closed😒
So obviously there's a nod to Michael J with the "shumon" lyric, but does anyone pickup on the nod to Janet with "newborn baby" choreography movement from I Get Lonely
405 people who ride the musical short bus - WTF #epic
I get chills before the song even starts
Omggggg❤❤❤❤... you guys DID THAT👏👏👏... HANDS DOWN!!! I LOVVVEEEEE THIS!
Gorgeous harmonies.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Why did I just fall in love???!!!
They all have great voices... very enjoyable.
March 15,2021😮💛😮😛
Good performance
Damn It man
Anderson finally getting the attention he deserves!! This man is so slept on!
Why nobody talking about simultaneous spin... so smooth
They are doing girl moves. Move the hips and swaying. These people are just sickening to me ......
When this is better than the studio recorded version 🥺🥺
Performance of the year no QUESTION
Omg I love ❤️ this song so much
Silky smooth retro groove.
For Bruno to collab as a group with Anderson says a lot about Anderson.
Well done 😘💋 Bruno and Aderson keep on vibing 😁🤙🤙❤️🙏
Bruno Mars had no business being this sexy
3:58 is giving me “this kitchen’s not same, without youuuu.”
Im suing whoever Thumbs down this video cuz WTF
2021 who? ...We just went back in time.
I just love this so much
Their harmonies fits right in to the performance.
Amazing!  I actually bought the song the day after it came out!  Can’t get enough of this song,.  It takes me back  to Motown and R & B classics.  THIS will be a classic!  The performance, showmanship, and talent is beyond measure!  Love Bruno and learning of the wonderful talent of Anderson Paak.  Perfect duo and wonderful arrangement.  REAL God-given talent with real musicians!  Vocals and harmonies are perfect!  Bought the Intro to upcoming album.  Can’t wait for the album to drop.  Please keep recording and performing.  This stressed out world needs this type of warmth, smoothness, and love! Congratulations Bruno and Anderson!  You have given our ears and hearts a gift!
Omg!! 😍😍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 The live was better than the original! Love, love, love this collab. ❤❤❤ Two of my favorite people, with all of their creative genius! I'm here for it. Also, as a 70's baby, I'm feeling the 70's vibes! #NailedIt
70s Vibes
i hope bruno mars knows that I have and still have simped for him for my enitre adolescence.
homie hit an e flat in chest voice on national tv
Perfect
Love you Bruno Mars
Just so lovely....😍😍😍
So talented
So smooth...this is what talent looks and sounds like, and no need to remove kids and pets from the room.
the PERFECT duo
How is this better than the original? The runs and add-ins! It’s the “I got filets” that got me!
Maaaaan 😍😍❤❤👏👏💯💯
AHHHHHH BRUNOOO
I know the Grammy's happy about adding them.. awesome
Can we talk about how smooth that transition is when Paak and Bruno switch spots after the first verse. Effortless!
Current Kings of soul!! So good, reminds me of music I grew up with... keep rockin Bruno and Silk Sonic, so glad that the Grammy’s had you on!, Love the cool 😎 70’s brown suits and aviator sunglasses 😎
Aaaaammmmaaaazzzinngggg

They really stole the show.
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Literally as smooth as butter
This was the highlight of the whole evening.
SOOO GOOOODDD 😭😭
Retro 60’s/70’s feel w/ a 2021 groove. Silk Sonic❤️❤️❤️
Anderson sounds like Ralph Tresvant (New Edition) toward the end.

This whole joint is flawless, and from 3:30 til the end I almost threw my laptop across the room.  IT'S AMAZING!
Wow!!!!❤🙌🙌❤💣💥

it sounds exactly like the song, like if they just played it over
Anderson park sound like Tyrese
Only people who didn’t come from tiktok are worthy of liking this comment
I've never heard this song and I was born in 79'! I've never heard of the group🤔 but I like it🤗
Bruno is the entire mood of 70's funk, r&b soul 🥰 💖 Take me to church!! 🙌🙌
The song is so good, the only thing I can think of to say is murder fire.
I knew it was lit once I sign Anderson Pak name
its too good
someone please tell me where anderson's glasses are from, they're so prettyyyy
It’s kinda crazy that this is a lot of people’s first exposure to Anderson .Paak but I hope everyone starts listening to him and they realize that this man don’t miss!!!
THE CHOREO!!!!!! GO THE FUCK OFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
🔥🔥🔥‼️‼️‼️💯💯💯REAL SINGING REAL MUSIC
Bad Ass
It's like the 70s and the 2020s had a baby.
I know life is hard but don’t give up! The truth is God loves you so much that he sent his begotten son Jesus Christ to die on the cross to pay the full price of our sins. To be saved from dying in your iniquities you must call upon his name,confess him as Lord,believe God raised him from the dead,and repent.God bless y'all!💝
That man Paak is the star of the show 🤷🏽‍♂️
This performance is so smooth. The vocals, the dance, the camera movements:👌on point.

Bruno looking like a young El Debare. I can dig it!
Excellent performance at the Grammys last night
Bruno Mars is exceptionally talented.  My, can he sing and dance.  Bruno turned the Grammy out.  A night with Bruno!
Bucket List SEE BRUNO MARS IN CONCERT!!!!!
I left the door open
I’m playing this back to back!
Pure talent and class! The only performance at the Grammys that was outstanding. Everything else was pure trash.
They don’t even need autotune.
WOW. I'M SPEECHLESS. Funny how Bruno had to ask for the spot but grammy's thought it was a good idea to perform wap.
Why he gotta be so fineeeeee  😘🥴🤤😫😍
I Love the Beautiful Old School Love Music they bring back!
Wooow this is timeless....
This was so fucking cool. Anderson is on fire
Listening to this song with the biggest stink face, DAMN THIS SHIT CLEANNNNNN
Bruno Mars and Dave chappelle
90s era artists full stories up now narrated by the animated hip hop puppet
In the  minute 1.59  ohhhh  alleluia uia uia uia...  Madre mía 😱
you know the song good when the live performance sounds exactly like the recording
Great Performance!!! 💯👊🏽👍🏽
Paak and Mars did their THANG!!!... they were both great and deserve all the credit and praise, its both their song its a duo... loved it!!!!! 😍
That some real, sho nuff singing! I love it. What a performance!
I miss seeing him perform. He DEFINITELY did not disappoint. its kind of impossible for him to do so. 💜
Can we bring back those suits ????😍😅
What temptations choreographer they stole 😳
Best performance of the night
From the suits, to the choreography, and the vocals, this performance was EVERYTHING.
I love that they're bring back that 70s feel
Best Grammy performance this year by FAR!
YES 🙌🏾
That spin at 0:55 was 🔥 True Performers!
This was the best performance of the night. Love me some Silk Sonic.⚘👍
I am buying a ticket for this shit as soon as it's available
Beautiful, flawless, waited all day Sunday just to see them perform and perform they did with easeeeeee ! As for the rest of the artists on the Grammy's , please !!!!!  Bruno and Anderson delivered and still waiting for the responses ....
It felt so nostalgic watching this
🔥🔥🔥🔥
my jaw dropped like 12 times already
it was so good
Why is it better than the original and I’m not even half way through ✋🏼
The way y’all just ate this...sickening
The vocals tho 😍😍😍😍😍
Holy crap Bruno sounds better than ever
I love it! Great preference!
I’m obsessed
It’s the sexiest way I’ve ever heard someone say leave the door open 😩
This makes me want to get back to my GF that I never had and just sipping wine on sun down🍷 but I don’t have any
„shamone“
That’s it y’all a group now forever and that’s on the Jackson Five.
They fkg killed it🔥🔥🔥
Playing this songs until i get tired. Because I’ll leave my door open for everyone that needs it 🤗 Great song 😌
Worth the 3 year wait
Loved it. ❤
All it takes is a mustard seed hold it don't let go y'all on the right path beautiful prana music 🎶 confirmation 👼🏾♏🤴🏾🦚👍🏾🔁🤳🏾
PARK MARS `\^_^/`
woooooooow....what just happened? I'm speechless. I'm so in love with silk sonic.  I'm going to need this on vinyl
"If you hungry, I got fillets".  I bet a few of the other stars were like "where they at?  you got fillets?  Dang, Bruno.  Dang, Anderson.  I'm hungry."
BRO I have listened to this song at least twice a day since it came out
Your performance was amazing
This should be number one trending
I love you guys so much. Your performance came on while I studying and it made my whole day. I hope I see you guys one day
I wish Bruno Mars and the Rock would do a comedy/chick flick together.  I think it would be brilliant!
The bells, the lapels....fabulous!
this song is just too good...
Fabulous <3
Wow. This is epic. Sounds even more amazing than the record.
Amazing performance!!! 🤩😍🤩😍🔥🔥🔥
Man the track really only needed Bruno lol like the studio version sounds all like Bruno anyway. Best performance on the Grammys tho 💯
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates🔻
That tour gon be insane
Someone send Bruno back in time already

Best performance of the night❤
This was effortlessly the best live performance
Just when I thought I couldn't love Bruno Mars more.....   lordy, lordy.... This is definitely smooth as SILK...
Flawless
That ending with both of them in unison, that was well executed
Silk Sonic was the Grammys!
I'm bout to blast this while standing in the doorway making "fuck me" eyes to my neighbor. Y'all hold up while I get this restraining order.
Amazing! Love both of these guys, but together is even better! I love the 70s throwback style too.
I never knew silk sonic was what I was missing from my Playlist
#VERYFRESH
Wyd!! Whea you at???
Anderson is so smoootthhh 😍
I always thought it was silly when girls would faint over Celebs but... I would faint if I saw these 2 🤩
The Temptations remix!
I can’t take it 🥰🥰🥰🥰
I love everything about this song.
WOOOOW THIS SAVED THE WHOLE GRAMMYS
The way they sing this my heart melts repeat all morning😍🙌 get it bruno!🔥
i just nutted
This is what R&B should look like!! So you old school... I love it!!!😘❤️😘❤️😘❤️😘❤️😘❤️😘❤️😘😘❤️
so good
the Temptations vibes and I'm here for it!!!
soo.....that brought me soooooo much joy
People: gushing over Silk Sonic  Also people: putting Pop Smoke, Lil Tjay and 24kGoldn in the top 10
Bruno is such a sexy dancer...
B.O.B sitting here after his career has gone south like "Damn, That should've been me instead of Paak!!!"🤣🤣🤣
Awesome!!!
best performance of the night!
I think I'm pregnant after watching this.....I threw my bra at my cellphone. I don't know who's open door I'm about to walk through but it's somebody's 😍😍😍😍😍
Old school class is back right there!!!!🥂🍾❤️
Man bruno can get it with this i love the 70s vibe looking sexy... Great performance and vocals😍🔥
Disco Bruno says - RnB LIVES MATTER
petition to put this version on Spotify
I've listened to this about 50 times today!! LORD! Amazinggggg
I love this song ❤️❤️❤️
I’m very excited for this group!!!! They are amazing 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
I missed Bruno so much omg
This is my new favorite song, this joint hits me like some Al Green on a early Saturday morning.
Harold Melvin with a little Spinners Graced with a dose of The Whispers just Happened.. I’m in heaven!
I’ve missed Bruno so much I’m crying 😭 like omg he does something to me 😖😭👏🏽
This is magnificent ❤️
Woo woo woo woo woooooo
I swear seeing Bruno like this makes me happy because I’ve been listening to him since I’ve been really young🥺💙
What the song sounds like:🤍🤎👏🏾🤩✨🧑🏾‍🦱🔥 the next Jackson 5 (4)
You don’t even need background music
Versace on the floor while the door was left open
That Motown style 🔥
Bruno and paak man they need to make a bunch of songs together holy crap
SUPER. And so amazingly 1970s cool...right down to the rust-colored, vested, bell-bottomed suits with the open-collared shirts and aviator shades.
Amazing truly 🥲
They raised the bar so high the rest of the show went straight to dvd
Yo this dude found the pulse of real music and permanently stuck his thumb on it!!!!! I love it guys...MORE MORE MORE!!!!
This was smooth .
I can’t get enough of this song and video
A FCKN MAZING😩✨✨✨
old school is the new school,finally something worth listening to over the crap
You " TWO " BadAsses !! lol.lol. And enjoying it, while you doing it, thou. Bring it ON, PLEASE.
They are just so talented
I FOUND MY HALLOWEEN COSTUME FOR 2021 YAAAAALLL...I'm the 5th MISSING MEMBER 🙌🙌🙌🙌
classy
Yes yes yes!!!
Anderson showing that he not just a rapper and I am here for itttttt let them know!
Everytime see these two I wish Michael and prince would've done a song together.. this closest I will get
First of all, Anderson Paak is baby daddy. Second, from the very start of this performance they had me hype. Third, kudos to whoever's idea it was for these two to come together for this beautiful collab! Bravo guys!!!
God... help....this is too good. JUST TOO GREAT!!!! Gotta get up and CHANGE MY UNDERWEAR!!!
Like the Manhattans, I love it, it's a good opportunity to revive the oldies but goldies
Amazing performance!
Bruno Mars lookin' like my man Ichiban Kasuga.
this what being a singer is all about, a real singer
I love this song. It reminds me of the 70s Soul Songs.
Omg!!!!👏👏 But!!! The end it's much better the original one.   For me!
I would give any thing to her David Ruffin cover this
Should Have Just Handed Over Grammy's For 2021 Best Album and Song! They had to practice the Temptation style dancing moves a lot it showed. After Watching the Show The Competition In Music is Just Hopeless! Just Video Choreography Artists Not In The League of the Performers That Play Live and Know Instruments. Just Shaking Yo Ass is Just That! Sorry Billie E was Lame, Dua, Cardi B, Beyonce,  and the Stallion Just Ass Shakers music won't be remembered a year from now. Post Malone surprised me very talented the best hip hop artist in the show. Swifty Knows the Game but I think has run her course after this. BTS showed Asian Artists are Coming On Fast and the talent is getting very good. Black Pumas Robbed need to go on tour with Silk Sonic the Music Industry in Gonna change Big as it does every decade and a half or so. Gone will be the Boom Chucka Boom  and Live Music and Bands Are Coming Back as the Genre changes Again! Silk Sonic and Black Pumas Show Us the Promised Land We Need It! As Ringo said; Peace Love!
Dang! 50 Years later and they haven't aged a bit! That's crazy!
Holy shit, the harmonies, the dance routine, really amazing, cant wait for the album
I didn't think it could sound any better than it already did.
LOVE IT
I can’t stop crying.
Love all of this....
Anderson Paak🙏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👍🏽
Loved it!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Took me baaaacckkk 😎👍
I love ❤️ this song 🎶 Bruno is amazing
Listen... I'm already in line camping out for tickets. Hurry up!
I’m so happy to see Anderson Paak getting some mainstream love. He is so good
Bruno: Hey Y'all, bet I can make you like your momma's music. Watch This!
He could take u back to the 70s and leave u there.
This song is easily the most sexy and smoothest song released in a very long time.
All I can say is THANK y’all!!!!!❤️❤️❤️
Well, luckily not all at the Grammys was 💩💩💩💩
James Brown is smileing from heaven
This is that old school feeling,,,like groups when they swag together. If silk sonic reading this, keep doing what yah doing. If this is culture vulture, like haters trying to say I LOVE IT!!!!!!!
I 👏🏽 Fucking 👏🏽 Just 👏🏽 CAN’T 👏🏽 Wit-Chyall 👏🏽 ❤️❤️❤️😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️
Earth Wind and Fire vibes... This what we need more of. Smoooooth real talent.
Good Lord. I thought the studio version was flawless. I’m still looking for my skates to take my wife on that couples only skate to this song...
"Shmone!" Bruno so dayum smooth! 💯💥🔥
ABSOLUTELY. OBSESSED.
Just came out with the song + getting asked to perform at grammy's not even a few days later= history
Loved this performance when the Grammy's were on yesterday. Think it is my most favorite. Bruno Mars is such a talented artist and singer and I'm glad he is back. Loved Silk Sonic everyone did and great job and gave an AMAZING performance.
Now this is how you put on a show!!!
Anderson is so damn smooth
Bruno is Back!
REAL MUSIC
im crying. this is music to my ears oml
Everytime I hear this song I think of Red from the Five Heartbeats with the cheesy grin lol just imagine Silk Sonic followed by Bird and the Midnight Falcons - that would be a fire show
The best Grammy's 21 performance and those who agree are breathing
Damn this is timeless perfection. Harkens back to the golden age of R&B
I just wanted to remind everyone, this is 2021 and we just got this dropped on us. Beautiful.
This was beautiful 😊this reminds me of music specials on ABC when I was little awesome awesome job
Insane
This is so remarkable!!! If they come to town I am just going to have to risk my life to see them! F COVID I’m in there with no regrets!!!
This is so smooth, definitely a mood for sure. It makes me close my eyes and  smile😁
Bruno Mars always gave me “rapey” vibes I don’t know why...
Anybody else crying?
Thank you Silk Sonic for goin ol school all the way🤍you guys are the real deal☮️
63rd😂😂
Good ol' soul and rhythm and blues... All aboard the soul train!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
❤❤❤⚘⚘
reminds me of what I grew up listening to ...i'd leave my dooorrr open lol
Bring back the soul train amazing performance 👊👊
Bruno, My mom just love you.
I'm going to show this song to my grandchildren
THIS MY MOST FAVORITE PERFORMANCE. AND THE PART WHEN HE SANG THE OTHER SONG BEAUTIFUL
This is the kind of soul stirring R&B we have been missing and I have been waiting for. Thank you.
this was probably the best performance of the night besides harry styles
And why Cardi B's perfomance has more views?
Man listen!!!! First I love how they didn’t try to do too much and over do it! Beautiful performance!!! But if my bae Bruno didn’t sang all he want to!!!!!! My lord!! I listen to this song every day, multiple times a day!!!! 🥰🥰🥰🥰
A duo we didn’t know we needed!!! Silk Sonic is far out!!!
Bruno Mars is the new KING of POP!!!
Damn that synchronized spin after the first verse was straight 🔥🔥🔥
This is so dope! Thank you Bruno & Anderson 🙏🏼
This performance gave what it was supposed to gave
11/10 PERFECT PERFORMANCE
The crowd cheering when Bruno hits that second hook is that “damn this is really happening this is amazing” cheer from other musicians
feeling hella suede today... shiiiieett.. lovely bring the good rhythm and blues back to the world to enjoy. RNB.. baby-making music!!!!
Their live sound exactly like their song! Love it!!!
AMAZING!!!!!
Ok, so when are we getting a complete album??
Voices strait up... 🧈🧈🧈
Love how they deviated from the original slightly, especially in the outro- these guys are real musicians!!!
I can not get enough of Bruno Mars, then you're gonna add Anderson Paak and Silk Sonic?!?! Lord have mercy, I can't!♥️💋💕💋💞💋💘🌹
I love that they pay respect to the old RnB so much 🥰
Haven't heard real rnb in a long time.  Thank you Bruno and anderson
Smooth criminally good
They giving me the Whispers vibes from the 70s I was just on a whole spree of listening to that type of music I'm loving the vibe here.
Bruno brought the treasure music video back this beautiful 💯👏🏾
Murder......no competition in this new world of talentless hacks. This is art at it's best. Sill Sonic we want you and we need you. More more more more please
Thank you for taking us back even if for a brief moment. I was a child of the 70s and loved the music. But now, as an adult, I can now sing it w/such fervor and understanding. ❤😜😘
FIREEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Omg I'm so in love with this song😍😍 then when I found out it was Bruno!😍😍😍😍😍😍
This MUSIC🎶
Great !!!!!! 🥰🥰🥰
Damn. I thought the lyrics were  “if ya smoke I got the haze. And if ya hungry I got THE LAYS” which was seductive to me. 🤷🏻‍♂️
Lowest rated Grammy's.  Hmm. To bad.  Nice Performance. Sad times.
WOOOOOWWWWWW
Bruno is in a zone that no other Artist is right now,   Anderson is awesome and is blossoming even more.❤️
Seriously who is the 329 mudpuppies who thumb down this? How could you?
SMOOTH...
Literally my new favorite song
Why are they better live!!!!!! Yes lawd
"If you're hungry girl, I've got filets". 😂 Bruno always mixes in some humor in his romancing lyrics.
i think i would trade my six pack abs for brunos voice
Why this man only coming out with music once every 5 years. Fuckin hell. Too talented to hide from us lol
Just happen to be changing the channel when i caught the awesome performance, had no idea bruno mars could sing this good, WOW WOW WOW, and the 70's moves and outfits, mind blowing I wasnt' a fan of bruno, I'm a fan NOW and silk sonic.
This is fire.. i can't wait for the album cause if it's like this it's going to be a CLASSIC for sure!!
They should’ve won instead of Beyoncé !
They did a fantastic job. Okay I see ya💕🎶🎧
BUNCH of babies just got made
Goodness! 💦🤤😍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
How does he do it?! 😍
one of the best performances from the grammys in a while
I just got lost for 4 mins in pure joy
Yes ❤️
Dammmmmmmmmm❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Are they trying to make women get pregnant? Because in a pandemic, with a cold beverage-something is gonna happen!
SUPER DUPER 🔥
So beautiful 😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️
This is R and B and almost everything past 2000 is not
My dad thought this song was about a couple being so comfortable with their relationship that they go to the bathroom with the door open.
TSOP ... Philly Sound influences ... listen to the drum pattern ... Baad
Wow! This is incredible! Silk Sonic did not come to play!
YASSSSSSS THIS MADE ME SO HAPPY
anderson's note changes and extra runs that he threw in were just PERFECTION
YESSSS. DONT EVEN GET ME STARTED WITH ANDERSONS VOCALSSS 😩✨🥁
LOVE EVERYTHING about this...THANKS BRUNO and PAAK for REAL MUSIC 🎶💛
Who knew we NEEDED Anderson Pac & Bruno Mars as a group👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 this is tru R&B @ its best
OXNARD CITY to THE GRAMMYS Respect Anderson!

Chillllssss
What just happened, this will be on repeat!!!!
Amazing! Now this is True R&B like they used to do. Does remind me of MJ
Made my day!  Thanks youtube algorithm haha
Echoes of The Temptations and Smokey Robinson and the Miracles.  Pleasing to the ears and eyes. Nice work!
This cut right here makes me believe in R&B again!!!
Yes they did that 🥵
I love the feel good R&B music. Make up music, sing tune, the sway, and so on . The ol'skool appearance ❤️.
this shows brown's the best color, something abt it man, this whole performance was so fucking smooth, i can't wait for his album 2 drop and then for him to dip on us once again 💀💪🏼
Andy busted out the HIngle McCringleberry!!!

Im in love with this song 🥰👏🏾💯💪🏾
NASTYYYYYYYYY...I didn’t grow up during the soul glo era but this makes me wish I did!  SILK SONIC LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!
Bruno Mars is the musical equivalent of King Midas. Everything he sings immediately turns into gold.
I have watched this video at least four times and I just cannot get enough of it this is just amazing I just love it only thing I can say is wow wow wow Keep It Coming Bruno
Underrated
there's just no way they sat down, wrote this song out and didn't think "THIS IS GONNA BE A JAM, BOYS"
The aesthetic seems so gimmicky... Looks like the start of a Lonely Island video. Love the song, but the visuals are kind of cringe, like they're in costume
My favorite song for 2021. Genius
Yesssssss!!!! Finally real R&B 🙌💯👏
Woo! I just threw my panties at the tv.
Just simply, dope!
Pure fire. Love the throwback vibe. 🔥🔥🔥💥💥💥
To have a fucking voice like that GOD DAMN
I believe this was the most selfish performance ever 😆 You’re not supposed to take our world from us and make it yours. Bruno and Paak owned the night And maybe 2021 😭 so amazing 🤩
This makes me wanna put my subwoofers and TVs back in my car!!🙈😂😂😂😂  I have watch this too many times this morning...🤣
My fav song for 2021 🦋💯🔥❤️
This gave me all types of Jackson’s I’m here for it
THIS IS WHAT I NEEDED
Fast forward to 2026: "Dad, why are the boys in my class named Mars, Paak, Anderson, and Bruno?"
Increible siempre hemos estado aqui!
Yaassssss... soul music!!
A groove this bad is something we don't deserve but absolutely need. Woo wa woo indeed.
Exceptional performance 👏
This was 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I. Can’t. Stop. Replaying. This. Video. ITS SO DAMN GOOD. So excited for what Silk Sonic has for us in the future!
Man, this song is so good, I’m just wondering how many babies are gonna be made to it 🤣❤️
this is giving me vibes from when treasure came out... I like it tho :)
I just love that old school vibe  absolutely  beautiful
This is the best new song I’ve heard in YEARS

So you guys are going to have BJ the Chicago Kid on at least one song...right?
Yes, my brothers! Do it! Do it for R&B! Dopeness! Killin’ the song!
The best performance of the night
What in the Blue Magic is going on here! FIRE!

I wish michael jackson could see this masterpiece
Wow!!!
Fantastic! Omg
Vocals 🔥🔥🔥
The switch was smoooooth sheshhh this the best colabo ♥️♥️♥️☄️
And they had to beg the Grammys to perform....just be thankful someone said yes.  I would have hated to miss out on this.
The chops are so insane wow
Yo,Bruno Mars is My Dude!!! He’s an Incredible Artist 😎😎🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️!!!
That’s throw back soul right there!! Missed and appreciate the sound of this track. AP/BM killed it ... I was expecting one of them at some point during the breakdown to speak a verse in their deep voice 🤣🤣🤣
Still hope for Bruno Mars to play Edward scissor hands for a comeback of the original
Bring on the Coke!
So good!!!!😍
we should be dancing romancing ... ughhh. So damn good
Omg YES!!!!! I love it!!! 🙌🏿🙌🏿
This can not be Duplicated This is Perfection at its best
Does that song give you great old school R&B vibes. Bruno Mars is the man.
Yes...I love everything about 😍😍😍

So vintage. I love it.
Absolutely amazing! This is real R&B. I hope it will be contagious so we can get quality music back.
Bruno Mars feat the weekend   Lest do it people get the word out
the swag level 🚀
DAT BOY GOOD
I went from covering my smiling mouth with my hand, then moving my hand to the side of my face in longing admiration so many times during this performance. The only words that came ti mind...Jesus... brilliant.
They killed it!!
We had to go this far back for good r&b!!
such talent ❤️❤️❤️
I don’t think you understand, I’m obsessed
Silk Sonic this is beyond EXCELLENT!! AS A MATTER OF FACT THIS IS MY SSSHHHIIIDDDD!🌹🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
When you click the thumbs up button before the video starts because you already know it’s going to be music gold... 💛💛💛
I haven't anticipated an album in a long time, but judging by this performance I can't wait to hear the rest of the magic Silk Sonic has been making!
This song.  Yes.
Sounds like ‘Friday’ by Rebecca Black..
This was high style in 1972. 💕 I
Thanks Bruno and Anderson for bringing back REAL R&B.....90s style FINALLY!🤣😂😊😊😊🙌🙌🙌
Um........I’m wet.
beyond Smooth .... silky 😩🙌🏾🔥
💯🔥
Nobody can tell me to shut my trap... except for Bruno 😂
A VIBE♥️🔥🔥🔥
Come through harmonies....yes..
Y’all fucking did that
That gave me life oof
This is ridiculously good. Just fantastic. Love the collaboration. Choreography is Philly soul of the 70's. Lyrics brilliant. And Bruno's voice???? Sheesh. Other worldly. Love the stache, too. ; )
You know what? This damn boy can do as much coke as he wants if it keeps his brain flowing. With each album, he tackles a different era of music. This is very Chi-lites, Delfonics......
I'm so sick... this is SOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD!
They just don’t make music like they used.. hang on
They sound just like the record 😩
That F chord over G at 1:05 is amazing!
THIS is real music and artists!!!  Not that other crap they showed all night!!!
I'm so excited for this album. These two complement each other so well. Just such great vocal ranges and style. This is easily my most anticipated album of the year.
This song is an instant classic I thought I’d never see this happen again in music but I’m glad I’m here for it
💙
This was the performance of the night, by far!
Love this performance, brings back to old school  classics , approved by this grandma 😀
Loved this performance I got Commodores, Temptations & Five-Heartbeats vibes when I watched this
OMG!  Its the good ole 70's again!  Leave it open...we want more!
Knew the performance would be a classic, but this far exceeded my expectations!! Bring on the album
This is so, so good.
The album is gonna be amazing
The Delfonics, Chi Lites, Blue Magic, Harold Melvin and The Blue Notes  along with all those great 70's male R&B groups would be proud of this performance.  Love the way they channeled that era.
cant believe this am blown away this old and new at the same time they put it down awesome I thought Fat joy song the light was awesome this beautiful music both tracks at this time in the world is something special  God Bless We truly need this right now Bruno Has a old sole shot out to silk sonic awesome
This and Dua Lipa were the best performances of the night, at least for me.
If this is how the album is gonna be then we’re blessed
Come on Anderson man.. you ruined the feel of the song in the live after hyping the hopes in MV.. He's so looking kinda singing..
I love The Weeknd but Bruno Mars is a far gifted singer. He did a better rendition of “Message In a Bottle” than Sting. He may have made his own “Every Breath You Take” with this song. That simple song has lasted forever!
The aesthetics in this performance JESUS Christ of Latter Day Saints can they make us a GOLD thumbs up button on here? specifically just for Bruno Mars Silk Sonic, giving us magical nostalgic vibes
Great performance❤❤❤❤❤🎊🎊🎊🎊🎊🎉🎊
Bruno might have the best pipes in industry
WOWWWWW BEYOND LEGENDARY
D*mnit 🔥 🔥 🔥
How is it that i feel like one known this song my entire life!!!?? Like it's really a old school jam!!??? 😭😭😭.. Beautifully Composed!!
They fuckin
Damnit 🔥 🔥 🔥
YESSSS ATE THE ENTIRE CD
I didnt think this song could get any better, then they did this😩😩
Goddamn y'all WTF all the legends proud asf rn
BRUNO MARS UGHHH 😩😩
🔥🔥🔥
This joint so hard!!
That performance was perfect! They will be the big winners next year. Loved it!
I didn't think this song could get any better ........ sheesh
Bruno has been tweeking, tinkering and doing his homework.  He really respects genres/eras of music and makes it his own.  This is so smooth.  I have high hopes for their album.
No like... I’m obsessed 😍😩
the heart glasses put it all together honestly bruh.

The steps, the harmonies; but I'm pretty sure Bruno said "Shom On Over" at the end of the vamp! Lol Loved it!
God bless Silk Sonic🙌🏾
I loved this.
I thank the universe everyday that my boyfriend looks and acts smack like Bruno Mars
Performance of the night by far. Dope.

Both of them combined in a music like this is so amazing, Im Glad both of them had made this song, and more to come as Silk Sonic
i won't bite, nuh-uh, unless you like. that was smooth
Making my legs weak 💕💕💕💕
This is like the Whispers meets the Temptations, Delfonics, Four Tops, and Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes. I absolutely love this 1970s vibe and they killed it with the live vocals!
I love that Anderson still threw in that woo woo woo woo 😭😭😭
Why bruno mars so fine tho? Like dang lol

Bruno Mars drops a song like ones a year or 2. It’s always turns out to be a banger lol
Marvin Gaye would be proud of these two
Wow. Wow. Wow. I need a pantsuit now and Anderson Paaks sunglasses!
Epic
The world needs this so bad.  If Bruno stops making music we're doomed.
Baby makin music 🎶 Damn, almost took my panties off and threw it at my phone. I need a glass of water...whew.
People sleep on Andy Cheeky. I'm so glad People are recognizing his talents
Divine masculinity
Kings

Smooth like a knife thru chilled cheesecake. 2021 needed this like a fish needs water 💧
I love it
it’s the pelvic thrust for me. 😅
Al Wilson would be so proud 🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
The footwork here is flawless. Familiar and fresh. Award winner.
I’m nostalgic for a time when I wasn’t even born... they did that! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
🔥🔥🔥🔥
SO FUCKING SEXY
Yo! This is life right here! 💥💥💥
2021 vibez😍😍😍😍
So this is what cocaine sounds like.

Can't tell if they lip syncing or not.
In.thee.POCKET
My Goodness Bruno 🙌🏽
Beautiful ♥️
This old lady loves ya Bruno 🤩⭐️
✨ A star was born with this performance. I felt like I was a teenager all over again✨
In case anyone ever doubted these two dudes singing abilities. Here they are as a duo just to remind you that they are on a whole different level than most singers of this time.
❤️
No live show is safe when Bruno and The Paak Man enter the place!
Yes.Yes. Yes..... Enjoyed this Where the 70's babies @ 71 in the 🏠. Beautifully done
Is this what heaven feels like?
Their on another level....just that simple...looking forward to the album
Tag Team Champions of the World..... wooooooooh....My OG'z would say: Run that Tracc BACC Son... Cruisin.. Summer Gonna C Lit
Great performance
5
Straight fire. When you’ve been waiting on some new Bruno heat and then him and A Paak for a fire group. Bring on the album lol
Man...I swear I can feel the polyester and see the K-Tel record commercial from my childhood...
This album, whenever it drop is finna be fiyaaaaaa 🔥
Reminds me of 70s R&B..  THANK YOU!
Gonna be the best tour since the Victory Tour
C'mon Stylistics and Delfonics. Lol...love it.
YEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSS: AWESOME PERFORMANCE OF A PERFECT SONG!!!
2020 happens  The world: Bruno we need you man Bruno: Hold on, I'm not ready just yet The world: 😫  Enter 2021  Bruno: Okay NOW I'm ready, what about you Paak? Anderson: Ready as I'll ever be 😌 *Releases the single* The world: We now understand your process, thank you for this masterpiece.
So much 70s vibes coming from this song but that line. “I’m gonna leave the door open”  has that Teddy Pendergrass feel-LOVE IT! Those 70s R&B love songs had such subtle sexiness coming thru the music. So glad to see that coming back!
Belts an Eb5 at 3:21... flawless
Anderson. Paak said he was gonna get them wu wu wu wuuuu’s in by any means 😂😂😂😂 I love it ✨
I just went gay for 4 minutes and 16 seconds
Crazy Talented ❤️
I cannot stop watching this <3
Ahhhhhhh
This is perfection. Sexy, smooth, and the vocals are A1. ❤️ I’ve been waiting for a R&B come back. Keep it coming!
How are there thumbs down on this ?
I saw a lot of artists who literally brought a whole movie set at the stage and these guys were only having their microphone and vocals that's it.. They literally don't need anything more... They rocked with out any stage decorations... LEGENDS
Listen. I’m not saying the guy on the right is Dave Chappelle but...
Venice. Malibu. Ventura. The World.  Yes Lawd!!
🔥🔥🔥 (<—  because I’m at a loss for words)
This is epic 🔥
0:54 that's so satisfying 😂
Trash Af!!  Two non-black ppl singing soul music!!! Lol!!
I wish this had auto-generated captions. 😥
I have always wondered how they planned on ending is considering it was a fade out. That was amazing
That neck Bruno & Anderson, I see you 😱
THEY KILLED THIS SHEESH 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Now that is music. None of that rediculous hip hop. Fabulous display of talent.
This is about to be one of the greatest albums of all TIME 🙌🏾 I CAN NOT FCKING WAIT 🤸🏾‍♀️ I'M FIENDING FOR MORE!!!!!
More of this music please.  That’s all.  Thank you!      Today’s music SUCKS!!
A melhor apresentação do Grammys e quem concorda respira
Y’all really smoked that!!! 🔥🔥🔥
Music is timeless 🔥🔥🔥
Pure talent
Wonderful!!! Finally music again!  Real entertainment!  Thank you! Hugs!
Shoutout to Bruno’s hating ass engineer for making this track fire for everyone, iykyk !
Wow.. I’m speechless..
This was amazing. It reminds me so much of the music of the 60’s and 70’s R&B. What a great song.
I could easily listen to this performance all day. 🧍🏻‍♀️
The Weeknd didn’t even get a Grammy nomination lol
Idk how Bruno Mars doesn’t have a orgasm when he listens to voice
Can someone please tell me where I can order a suit like this?
Luv it! ✌🏾😎
What a boss performance. And a big tune.
This part gave me a heat attack 3:20
THE SPIN WITH THE MIC PIC UP IN SYNC WITH THE SONG AND DANCE MOVES 🔥🔥🔥
Ever since the Super Bowl and you performed when I was 3 or 4 I loved your music and you inspired me to sing and now Im gonna practice
This is everything when it makes you feel good and happy... 🔥real music 💕
I love love love this song 💞... great duet.  I'm downloading to my playlist...
Now this what I’m talking about! Just a good feeling back in day backyard bbq chillin with a shot of Hennessy in my right hand! Feelin good! 😎👊🏽
Fire has that ol skool vibe this is real good music
I am so impressed by this work of art.  A perfect masterpiece in every way.
And you know they’re having a blast!!
This duo is to strong its not fair
Bruno really came out of quarantine like “HEELLLOOO WORLD 🕺🏽 I’M BAAACK!!!!!”
I have goosebumps!! This dancing is so SLICK! And obviously the singing is yummy, wowwww they did that!!!
jump in the caddilac
It’s giving The Temptations, and I love it!🤩🙌🏽
This is real music right here! With the throw back feel!  All of his stuff is so good!
Yes!! About time we got a nice jam to really relax and listen to ❤️❤️❤️
I love their modern Motown vibe! It just fills up my soul.
Bruno can give it to you from every decade..70s 80s 90s whats next? Cant wait to see it
If a Caveman heard this, he wouldn’t need to start a fire. All he needs is to play this near the firewood and it will light up. That’s how fire this song is. 😃
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
2:39 just hits DIFFERENT
This album will spark a new birth explosion😂
99.999% of Best songs in 2020 and 2021 are Christian Songs by Christian Artists. Spiritual Love Music with God is what we were Created for and when Musicians get a Beautiful Song in this Realm..its second to none.
Thank you for blessing us! I am so stoked for this album!
So COLD!!!!!
we gotta enjoy his music while he's still active. In a year or so he gonna ghost us for two years and come back like nothing happened.
I love Bruno Mars style of MUSIC
“Cocains is a hell of a drug” -Rick James
Omg!!!!! Perfect combination 🤩🤩🤩🤩🥰🥰🥰🥰😍😍😍😍
Yassssss 🔥🔥🔥
Y'all are just too cold. Them getting together was more unfair to the game than when Kevin Durant signed with Golden State. We've got the next super team here folks.
Feeling it
BABYYYYY I NEEDED ALLLLL THESE VIBES! YALL 👂 HEAR ME!? 💛😩
YESSSSSSS!!!! IT'S FIRE!!! I LOVE 💕 LOVE 💕 LOVE 💕 IT!!!!!🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😍

I can’t wait for the whole album and tour!
The greatest performance of the night!! Easily.
This was too good🔥🔥🔥

*starts packing bags* I’m COMING!!!!!
I really hope they can bring this type of music back and introduce it to a new generation.
Bruno betta swing them hips!!! 😍
Talent

Im on borderline tears. I have wanted this album since 2017 when i first heard of Paak and HS me wouldnt have been disappointed cus Freshman in College Me LOOOVES THIS
best performance.
he’s so cute
Hey look it’s Ichiban from Yakuza 7
Had to look it up bc this was the only thing I cared for from 🗑 Grammys
They killed that I didn't like the song at first c until I seen it live🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I miss this style so much-so great to see it again.   So good.
EVERYONE IS SLEEPING ON THIS
This song so smooth and so playa. Leave the door open baby. The perfect collab🔥🔥🔥😍😍
CeeLo Green vibes!
Wow wow wow amazing😍 this a classic show stopping group.  Now this is what I love to see at the Grammy's Thank you bruno👏👏👏👏
Bruno's voice is so insane live.
The best song his voice is getting better
What an amazing performance
The dislikes are from those with no doors
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️
This is a comedy skit. 🤣
Love love love this sound ❤️
Ayyyeeeee bring it back ‼️❤️
I hit like b4 I even  watched it. Great performance
damn i missed you 😭
Silk Sonic on their way to carry us throughout the year👏👏 you guys are incredible
So epic and that’s how you do it🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
Ole Skool “Red light/Blue Light” basement slow drag jammy. 👏👏👏👍🏽
bro why is this better than the studio version LMAO. Bruno is the greatest performer in a post MJ world
fuck the grammys, but GOT DAMN Bruno, Andy and Co really snapped with this performance!
This performance alone deserves a Grammy🙌
Goats literal goats, undefeated, spectactualar, goats.
Where is the VINYLLLLL??
Bruno is actually the loml. He sang this so beautifully and I just-
INCREDIBLE.
Killed it!!!❤🔥🔥
😭❤
“I got the Lays” 🤣
I grew up on old school music.  I love how this hits the feel of it so perfectly.  ❤❤❤
That was so damn good!
MY FAV EVER OMG
OH YES! 👏 This is what we didn't know we needed!
his vocals are just give me chills 😩
What do I have to do for a whole album?
OMG OMG OMG!!! THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY
Yesssssssssss
Be still my heart! ❤ real music again
That is a jam!!!
Stopppp cause I’m literally playing this at my wedding I swear
This was so bomb!!!
The fact that it sounded just like the original song but better just gave me goosebumps.
Sexy from the start to finish !!!🤩🤩🤩
Terrific!   Perfect.
I was waiting for a live performance ever since the song came out 😭😭😭
I didn't know Bruno had a group.
They killed this!!!!🔥🔥🔥
This is arguably one of the best songs I've ever heard in the last ten years
Those temptations vibes though
Auto tune has left the chat
If I was half as cool as Bruno Mars is, I'd be frozen solid
Like why is this better than the recorded version 😍😍😩😩
bruno mars hmmmmm marry me. lmao.
so we not gonna talk about them focus pulls in the second chorus. Everything about this video/performance is flawless. FLAWLESS.
I really hate that I missed this. Two of the industry's best during this time. At the Grammys had someone worth watching.
2 of my favs!!!!!! Great performance!!🥰❤Oan .....BEST PERFORMANCE OF THE NIGHT FOR ME!!!!
Yooooo I screamed the whole performance.  My girls were screaming.  My fiance friends were not. lol  However he was trying not bop but even he couldn't help but groove.  By the way I never thought of Anderson .Paak as this much of sex symbol before.  Heeeey Bruno... (wink).
(3:37) "Girl, I'm here just waiting for you...come on over I'll adore you!"  If that don't get her over there, she ain't the one!
It's way better when they're actually playing the instruments too
LOVE IT
AMAZING!!!!!! I LOVE ITTTTT
Glad Bruno back Weeknd was really getting on my nerves let them 2 have a versus i got Mars
So darn classic, sexy, cool, 1960-1070's chilling vibe!!! So much appreciated In 😍 🥰 💘
❤️❤️❤️
A lot of people need to go back and watch videos from the 1960s - Motown and the like - and see what they've been missing or never heard before.  This was a great performance - but as much a throwback and homage to the greats of that era.  Well done!
Beautiful!
So buttery smooth.  I had a Koolaid smile the entire time!!  Love great music!!!
Bruno Mars was better 👍
I feel like I’m watching Dave Chappelle perform with Bruno Mars
I thought I wasn’t gonna get my “WOO WA WOO WOO’s”!!!! HE CAME THRU WITH THEM!!!!
This was the best act on Grammys!!!!
Dat boy good!!! *coming to america voice*
Beautiful
This was better than the first video...I love the Delfonics/Temptation crossover styles!!!!
Can we appreciate that Anderson and Bruno tried to stay 6 feet apart? Smooth.
This RIGHT HERE!!!!!!
Nice of Bruno and Anderson to allow the Grammys to take place sandwiched around their performance
Where Knxwledge at?
Wow 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Best performance
They're about to takeover summer
So good...great sound what a fabulous match up. These two are magic.❤❤❤
All of this talent in one place! Im not in a relationship, but this would stir me to consider... Dawg!!! I'm waiting🥰
It’s just too forced for me. It’s like a SNL skit.
I deserve me some Bruno Mars! He is pure gold and gets you in a smooth mood
I’m obsessed with this song dude
When you outperform the original track!
👏👏👏🙌❤ Amazing! I love this song, the music video and now this live performance.  Bruno's live performances are always so entertaining to watch.
Speechless 😍
3:05 its the climax for me!
yall did yall thang !!!
Damn cant stop look at Bruno package 🙃 Wonderful performance Handsome 😘
their vibes are so beautiful, their voices are so beautiful
God that was so good 👏🏾💛
Anderson did his thug thizzle with these new inflections boyy! Bruno was just as smooth as ever 💪🏽
This was an amazing performance
Their voices together is just muah beautiful
WHEW - that’s how you burn the stage up!!
IMO, The only really worthy moment pf The Grammys!
Loooveee it!
Whens the next song coming out Bruno Sammartino?
WOW
Effortless
This was so clean. Love it!
I have watched this an unhealthy amount of times.
That the lookalike or real one ? 🙄 y'all created a monster -
this is just... i’m... speechless...
🥰🥰🥰🥰 THIS WAS AWESOME!!
Love this!!❤️
two insanely talented dudes
Bruno- you could just stand there and I’d give you a thumbs up! ❤️❤️
This was so dope.
Best performance
I love Bruno... I love how He and his group are bringing the R&B sound to a new generation.
That performance gave me life +1...Their vocals compliment each other so nicely.. I can't wait for the ENTIRE album to drop!!
This a love making song for sure. Awesome song 🎵
You can almost taste the coke in the air
Oh how I’ve missed Bruno😭😭😭
This will probably be one of the best songs of the year and I feel like their next one will be even better
Although Lil Baby performance was great visually and consciously significant ...The best performance of the night goes to Silk Sonic! #RealR&B # Love it 😍
Just wow
Next year for the Grammys this song is going to take a ton of them!
They’re just so freaking talented 😍😍
Damn Bruno will sing your draws off!
Those suits!!
I'm so satisfied rn. Thank God for good music.
🥂🥂🥂🥂
Sang it
oh my lord
WHEWIE
They're bringing back the feel GOOD vibes from YRS ago....
Hey Bruno, you just keep takin your time with your music. Great things come to those who wait. Only tuned in to the Grammys to watch you guys then turned it off. Much thanks to you & Anderson for bringing some flavor to a dull an uninspiring time in mainstream music.
If you smoke I got the Haze  on point af, winning
He did it again 😭♥️
Man this is gonna be a hit when the full album hits this year
Amazing.   They are reviving the whole look of the great group artists if the 70’s. Can you say The spinners/Tempatations.   So excited
Them 2 together just ain’t far awards all over the place for sure. Love it
The combination of these 2, one word, AWESOME...
Man Anderson is amazing !!
A 1970s dream! ♥️♥️♥️
I Love this song❤️ Beautiful melody. Bruno has such an amazing voice!
🔥🔥🔥❤
They did that shit 🤣🤣🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bruno killed the high notes!
Them boys good!
holy shit....
This is EVERYTHING!!! I want to cry it’s so good lmaoo
let’s be real.. this is probably not the first time that you’re watching this
Por favor que vuelvan otra vez esas camisas 😍  Hermosa canción 🎶
fact: they work well together
Bruno the man dawgg
Anyone who dislikes this has no soul.
I don’t think we realized how much we needed this...Bruno is the voice... Anderson is the soul
Marry me Bruno 💋
melting with them vocals
the camera work is immaculate
Love this the Four Tops 2.0 😀😀😀😀😀😀
OMG!!! I'm going to leave MY door opened 😍🧡🧡🧡 BRUNO never disappoints.   The new STYLISTICS 😀
This performance made watching the Grammy’s worth it. Hands down the Best performance by far. It was hard to watch any of the performances after this 😂, especially when they put Taylor Swift on right after this performance. 🤣🤣
Amazing
Thank you Anderson.Paak and Bruno Mars for the trip back in time beautifully done.
May I know why this video get blocked in my country and other countries? I need VPN to get here.
They "cool" like silk
This is gonna be a hot duo...👍👍💯💯
Bruno was moving those hips with his lil 2 step...lol!
Love, Love, Love it!
This is so soulful you can feel it. They did amazing everything on point. It's that Old School music feeling! Love it
Oh yes, I can get my grown women on and sit back with a glass of Hennessy and vibe to this.
The best of 50, 60s in 2021.  Thank you both and Bruno you have been missed. Coming back in full style.
Bruno sang his assss off
i am speechless.. incredible performance..
Bruh seeing Anderson come this far when people tried to box him in is crazy
The vocals!! AMAZING!!
The performance of the night
These young men were given homage and respect to the people who paid the way for them to have careers today ❣️ I love it❣️
Bringin the past into the future

I love this song!!!
Absolute Perfection is right !

THEY KILLED THIS
Man this go so hard!👍🏾👍🏾
I need this on wax for sure !!!!
Love how Bruno steps out of the spotlight to let Anderson shine so it isn't all about him. He will always be all about the music. 💯👌🥲
They got that retro thing going on.  Killin it!
Why is Abel introducing them tho?
They look like when your moms put you in a music contest & you’re really good so now you gotta go all the way
THEY LITERALLY SOUND BETTER LIVE ARE YOU KIDDING
I hope they do more than one album because I can guarantee the first one will leave us wanting more
bruno's performance in this is better than megan the stallions career
Me as a mom: I don’t remember this song on Troll World Tour 🤔
Panties dropping music 🎵🎶🎵🎶🎵 🤣🤣🤷
I'm obsessed
This is SUCH an amazing performance
Yesses on Repeat 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰

Totally retro. Bruno is the man!!!
Shum on over!
Awesome! This song is classic like an Earth Wind & Fire song.

This amount of swag is truly uncanny
I miss Bruno mars
First thought when this came on was please twirl and change spots... I was not disappointed, so smooth.

Jocelyn Carter:: I love this song! They are so good!
They had to practice this Choreography for a minute. I love the throw back. It feels like The Whispers! 😉😉
I’m shumming. 😂
Why they sound even better live 😍
Omg no words can describe how wowed this is.  Love Bruno and to fact soo sexy😋 but I think he looks better without the stache. Bucket list to go to 1 of his concerts even though I know his tickets r half a leg

Love this song and performance. It makes u miss 60’s ,70’s , 80’s and 90’s R&B groups.
I feel like I'm witnessing greatness he nailed it or I should say they nailed it.....I get Motown vibes and a Little Temptations and David Ruffin all wrapped together pretty 😍🎶 I've waited for this moment all my life someone new to bring back the old-school where music and lyrics meant something...Silk Sonic is onto something Great.
I am going to cry
So dope!!! And it sounds so much like the studio version. The mark of true talent and artistry!!!
Chills.

They did the 70s R&B/Soul men bands justice...yassss 🔥🔥🔥
Grammys? I’m just here for these 2 legends ✌️
This performance reminds me of the Original Motown Sound of the Four Tops and the Temptations

This was so soothing I love the whole performance it looks really 70s vibe
Talk about 70's R&B.  Perfectly done.
👌
These two are about to create something that's gonna change the way we look back on the 2020's later on.
Live version better than the record
Great Lyrics, Great Sound, Great Stepping, Great Lead Singer, Interaction and Transition. Great Apparel, Big Collar Shirts Bell Bottom pants. Great Concept from Start To Finish. GRAMMY WORTHY PERFORMANCE. I will definitely add to the playlist !!!
This is the album Justin Guarini needed to make after the 1st season of American Idol.
Bruno Mars can’t make a bad song...I enjoyed this
So 70s and amazing!
First thought was a parody but love Bruno as an old man, he’s so good.
OMG!!!!
It's so crazy how Anderson keeps up with Bruno. Like he shows it ain't all about the crazy high notes. He's just too fucking smooth with it.
Yeah stop with that Bruno vs Paak mess. This is a perfect union. You vibe with either Bruno or Paak more sure. But this is harmony...& baby making.
Anderson the 🐐
Me talking to my future kids: "Yeah y'all, I was in the booth when they made this track. Listen to the ad-libs.... THAT'S ALL ME!!!!"
The 222 dislikes are from people that don't know nothing about good music...
YES BEAUTIFUL ❤️!!!!!
These 2 are some really talented cats, jack!
Yesssss! Love this, real music
Bruno I’ve been waiting for this great song 🎶
“There’s so much love we could be making...shamone” 🎶 Yes!!!! ❤️
My life will never be the same after this.
Like a wine 🍷 old and better 🇧🇷🇺🇸, love you back to 🌙
I'm soooo in love with this song😍😍😍 they are just amazing
Most singers use a lower key when they perform on a stage
It's like a 70's  jam
I’ve had the good fortune to see both live, both immensely talented. This is who they are as artists! Pure enjoyment.
Perfection. Amazing.
We really bringing bell bottoms back huh?
To all the youngsters looking for more tunes like this. Look up The Delfonics or anything Motown. This is heavily inspired by 60’s and 70’s soul music
Man this was smooth as fuck
Pure magic!😍
what kind of crack did they put into this performance
If you're watchin this video right now....you're pregnant
Yassss! I'm coming boo! Lol
this is just like the temptations
Best duo 🤯❤️❤️
This is music!!! Yessss!!! 👏🏾👏🏾
Anderson .Paak congrats!!! You've been working hard for this!!! Now promote Movin On which is an under rated hit !!!!!!!!!!!!!! We love your songs Bruno!!!
Everything and them watches too!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
PLEASE keep making music as Silk Sonic, this duo is blessed.
This is absolutely incredible! Giving me mad soul train vibes but with live vocals! So much talent it burns lol
Man y’all smooth!!! People don’t perform and sing like this anymore!!! Amazing guys
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
A person’s voice should not have this much of an impact on me
3:25 the natural vocals are mad goooood😭😭🔥🔥
One of the best combinations ever, they are amazing.
AHHHHHH
The amount of babies that will be made to this song is phenomenal
The song is just mad awesome. So classical 👌🏽
Wow!❤
The best of the best.
I swore it was Dave Chappell singing with Bruno Mars 😂😂😂
Absolutely Fabulous. The Past and the Future Today.
Best performance. Period.
Bruno Mars is infatuated with R&B Music....
They should do an Evening With Silk Sonic Netflix concert special AS their album release.
I have listened to the original like a thousand times...now I must listen to this at least two thousand times. My goodness.
He's lip-syncing, right?
This reminds me of the Treasure MV for some reason idk why
This was the best performance of the Grammys by far.
Muito amor por meu ídolo, Welcome Back prince and future king of soul pop music 🇧🇷🇺🇸🩸🩸🩸🩸❤️❤️❤️🍾🍾♈️♎️you are out of this world, GOD bless you always......🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Nobody does like Bruno,Disappear and come back with and Standing ovation
Y'all forgot the wear your stacked shoes; otherwise harmony/dancing was perfect.
They could easily just make this the music video
Chills🥰🥰🥰🥰
Everyone: Why they don't make good music like they did in the 70s???  Bruno Mars: Hold my drink—I got this. Yo Anderson...!!
This was so good man.
I used to hate those "this is better than the original!" comments...and then this happened.. smh
This performance gave me Chills...
Who else can pull this kind of music out in this generation? 😱 goosebumps....
Such a beautiful voice 🥲
Highlights:   Anderson at 1:32 Bruno at 3:20   Gooooooodnessss GRACIOUS YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME
I AM SPEECHLESS
Oh wha!  Fantastic
Killed it
Wow. This is better than the original video. Awesome...
This is damn near perfection
Omg I love this song so much. So smooth, like yessssssss. BRUNNNNNNNNO!!!!!! The best song out .
Buno Mars BRAVO
This song was needed right now. I get that old school vibe from it and it’s so breathtaking 🥰🥰
No auto tune, woooooow 🤯🤯😁
How is this better than the original bro 🤯🔥 OKAY ANDERSON I HEAR YOU BRO AND BRUNO ALWAYS KILLIN IT UGH YES
218 thumbs down? What's that? Take note this was a 'Live' performance.....fantastic performance.
😭
The in sync spin at 0:55 is so clean
Trying to have some Barry White level impact on the international birth rate.
I feel like, these two could have gotten together sooner. So brilliant!
❤️❤️❤️❤️
This performance alone >>> the Grammys
this is such a new vibe in music taste. im happy that brunos music is kind of going back to older music style. I like the new music don't get me wrong, but this adds a kinda 60s, 70s touch to it which is different, and unique. truly remarkable
🐐🐐
How in the damn hell does this song keep getting better...what in the hell
God damn I knew they were gonna be great together, but this was absolute 🔥🔥🔥
Dope!
How blessed we truly are to be able to see this Bruno Mars Perform Live .. 😱🤤👀👀
HOW IS THIS BETTER THAN THE ALBUM VERSION ALREADY HOLY CRAP
This is going on my Saturday morning cleaning playlist. 🔥🔥🔥
When you sound even better live than you do in the studio........these two are definitely onto something with this collab!!  Cant wait to hear their album.
LEGENDARY
Bruno Mars doesn’t need auto tune. Autotune needs him
So, uh, how does any other artist compete with this super team. These dudes are infinity stones! 😂🔥
That choreography is 🔥
Sorry Bruno. With the afro and glasses...you look like Sammy Davis III. 😂
Literally identical to the recording. No one else does it like Bruno and Paak.
Caraaaamba! O cara eh um MONSTRO no ao vivo tambem!
Man oh man!!!! Love this!!!!! A whole vibe and mood!! ❤❤
This, it's just not fair how amazing this is
3:54  LITERAL CHILLS. CHILLS, BRO. MY WIFE IS NOW PREGNANT. I CAN SMELL SOUND. I AM LEVITATING.
Luv it!!!!!  Awesome job!
Yyyeeeeeessssss!!!!!!!!!!!
Crazy over this!!!!!! They are amazing together...Missed you Bruno!!

SO CLEAN, so sexy...the choreography, the vocals and transitions...😩😍
Nostalgic 🔥🔥🔥
Loving this 70's Vibe...Love Bruno!!!

I really do love these two🤞 😭✨❤️  If they ever get the chance to play this live, and I'm there, I will be acting a FOOL in the audience! 😂👏
I looooove this song!!
This is giving me 70s and 80s vibes I love it
OMGOOOOOOOOOSH I LOOOOOOVE THIS!!!!
They went straight 70s, song and attire! Great song and performance!
Anderson with those MOVEESS, what a band, go get 'em !! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I love this song
Love the fact that they are giving so much homage to our parents and grand parents generation of BLACK SOUL MUSIC of the 60s and 70s....great artistry with their own twist.  It works, great song!
This was amazing
Best performance of the night...I went to bed immediately after😌
la la laaaaaaaaaaa   i lost my mind right there
Grammys need to adjust. There is so much talent, the ceremony should be 3 days... like catch up with times please! Fix these categories..
ANDERSON WENT TF OFF!!
This performance made me really like the song 🔥
Great performance 👏
this is my kind of music!
That boy good.
This is the best thing to happen to r&b right now
Grown folks music always leave you hungry for more....
Song of the year
This is dope bringing that mello sexy vibe back to music thank u Bruno and Anderson well done have a fabulous day.
I saw Bruno Mars in NY for his concert back in 2014 and still up to this date I’m amazed by his talent and voice. I would say he sings way better live than on his records.
The people who disliked this serve unseasoned filets, put Dawn in the bath, and guzzle their alcoholic drinks warm out of Styrofoam cups. Whomever you leave the door open for, when they come  through, I hope they rob you.
One of the best performances I’ve seen in years! Loved the retro vibe. Vocals were amazing. Gave me chills and had me swaying.
I feel rich watching this!
This song is fucking amazing and the performance was perfect 70s vibes
Man if they sang this live (no lip syncing) then this is one of the most ridiculously impressive performances I've ever seen...literally flawless.  If they did lip sync I don't really care tho cause the song is still awesome lol
when they do it better than the original...THESE MENNNNNN
Now that’s singing right there!!!
Effortless ❤❤❤❤❤
Amazing I’m a fan!
I'm so glad they were able to perform this. I loved every bit of it!
I'm in love with this song
Lisssssssstttttttteeeeeeeennnnnnnnnnn This collab, Anderson Paak's voice, their energy....................... This is GROWN FOLKS MUSIC!!!!!!!!  YES LAWD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Oh my stars I love me some Bruno he has been blessed with a writing composing and playing instrument talent
It’s the Outfits Dance Moves song Everything fa Me 💃🏾!!!
Uh... Wow... Switch... Debarge... Jacksons... Old male singing groups... You name it... They all in here lol
Love this feel. I hope they stay in this groove. It’s perfect
So smooth!
Amazing
Their vocals together are! 🔥🔥🔥
Bruno is a genius musician, showman, lyricist, entertainer❤️❤️❤️
We don’t mess with 63rd
Can't get over how good they are, the singing, the movement, the whole vibe, everything. And the way the light sparkles at 1:13 in sync with them is great
Anderson hit me with that WOO WOO WOO WOO WOO WOO WOO WOO WOO WOOOOOOO
This is EVERYTHING. You hear me?!!! LOVE IT.
Just AMAZING. Amazingly done with Love and Smooth. Effortless. You can just breath lightly watching this♥️♥️. Bruno and Anderson are GREAT
A beautiful Iconic moment ❤️😭
That's how it's done with class ...
I would like to see a verse with them and Jonny G and Ralph T. That would be epic.
This will be ELECTRIC if they’re able to tour
This song is too good
I want to know who the hell is disliking this? Like what are your tastes lol
This to cold for the winter , right on time for The spring ... ooooooweeeee.
Them boys showing out!
How does 209 people give this awesome song & performance a thumbs down??? 209 stupid humans 🤦 Please dont reproduce...
Bruno >> the weekend
They did that!!!  Harmonizes were amazing.
Michael Jackson somewhere in heaven saying That’s my boys
fucking living for it. waiting for this album. ugh. babes.
Musicians always stand out!! More please and go ahead and drop the album!!
I love it all.  The 70's vibe, the harmonizing, the dance steps.  He and they are fantastic.   But, the song is outstanding.
It’s only been a week and mfs act like this a classic 😂
Thought Bruno died
Flawless performance! Pure perfectionist! Silk Sonic  are LEGENDARY and they've just begun!

😍😍🥰🥰🥰
IM OBSESSED CHILE a great day to be gen z tbh
Bruno and Anderson were the best performance of the entire Grammys show tonight. True talent! Im so excited to hear this song and see Bruno again. Gotta love that man!  True genius.
What the Efff...how could you perform like this as if it was live...Its so flawless like an MV... you're a truly professional Bruno
OMG, i’m going to play this song all day everyday!  This video and the lyrics, takes me back to the good old days. I love the retro suits, sunglasses and smooth moves. Such a perfect collaboration!
You know Unc is watchin like “oh them boys good! See nephew that’s that real shit, this is grown man music you hear me boy”
🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌wow
I can't wait for this whole album! Making a baby off this one for sure!
Bruno came back with a hit🔥🔥
This was an iconic performance!!!!
Sucks they had to literally beg to perform 💀
When I first heard it I said the song had that 70s vibe but too see them do it at the Grammy Awards blew me away this song is the s$#t
Finally bruno is back!!!
Bruno SOOO SOLID! He's had the same background singers since forever. Maybe I should say singing brothers... #HooliganGang
This is so dope!!!
Imagine being so talented that you can do a 60's vibe song in 2021....... just Amazing 👏
Amazing 🔥
Never fails!!!....this is my "feel good" song of 2021 and until something makes me feel better(if that's even possible)
I literally never comment on yt but the FUCKING ARTISTRY IN THIS SONG!!!! Jesus Christmas y’all. So fucking jazzed for the album.
*they did the impossible boys and girls...*          *they made this better than the original*
#Classic
Omg I’m in love. This so beautiful. I love oldies! They just make me so proud. I know they make all old school artist proud!
Ouf! Bruno Mars never disappoints and Anderson has my heart for sure:). Bon Lundi à moi haha!
EXACTLY
It's like the Five Heartbeats!
Bruno is such a masterpiece!! Who knew he and Anderson Paak would make such magic
Who is hating on this song?! Whomever you are, you do not know amazing music. I feel sorry for you 😔🤣
Perfectly song !💕💕💕💕
Sweet.  Loving it..
Absolutely phenomenal!
Welcome back music its been a while
They are an excellent combination...It was bout time for Bruno to come drop something new on us
Bruno and Anderson make a great duo 💜💜💜💜
True artists...Bruno reminds me Michael Jackson 😍
I’m in love with everything.. the song, the performance.. just yessss!!!! 😍👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
chills
WAP right here 🙋🏾‍♀️. Damn 😬. My gosh 🥵. Swirming in my seat like ole girl from The Five Heartbeats when JT was singing is there a heart in the house tonight 🤭
Whew Chile!! Silk Sonic took me back to the heyday of "The Delphonics", "The Stylistics", "Blue Magic", " Bloodstone", "New Birth" and "Black Ivory".  Authentic 1970's delicious soul with the suits -- choreography -- visuals -- everything.  Real music is back and I am here for it!!  Bravo young men -- Bravo.👏👏👏👏👏
wow!
Simply amazing!!!
Throwback look & feel
They bodied this lol
Cold blooded!!!
Song 🔥
YEEEEEEEEEEES
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
this is incredible i’m so happy
Real artist right here!!!!!
Bringing Black Classical SOUL For Ya, Appreciate Ya
I didn't know 2021 even needed this but it did.
That was amazing. So smooth.
I am ashamed to have never heard this song. This takes me back to my youth.
This dude Bruno has struggled his entire life. Gotten rejected various times in the past. Look at him now, one of the most successful and talented artists of our generation. The fact he begged the Grammy’s to let him sing shows how passionate he is for music. Aren’t many artists like him. Truly inspiring.
Ok I’m just gonna say it PERFECT that’s it😍😍
Just perfect....
i cant with Bruno there's no bad song he has that's why hes my second fav artist and i only have two so that tells you something <3 there couldn't be a better song than this and this performance made me tear up
Bruno Mars is one bad Puertorican!
This is such good shit
Soul music 🎤
Bruno is so damn smooth!
Damn. I am swooning....😍 That's some serious baby makin music. I think my ovaries just woke up and dropped some eggs....
This has quickly become my favorite group just from this one song. These two together have revived R&B and Soul music.
Man THIS is what we should demand as R&B and should accept no less!
I don't ever want to hear another person say real music left wow wow wow amazing I can't wait for this album and thats a lot to say
Maaaaaan! They did that!!!👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽😊
keep play it over' and over!!!!!
How did they make a song better than the other one? That's what I call real talent!
This song is a coupe deville, 8 track player and a surf board romance. Aloha Honolulu and Ewa/Eve beach. Pretty sure this will be a Smith n Union Karaoke hit on Hotel St. This song may be where babies come from.
Please listen also to Anderson Paak - Whole album!!!!!!!!!!!
Okay wow.. that was straight fire, amazing performance! 🔥❤️
Bruno Mars really comes out of hiding for like a split second and then he goes back to ghosting us again 💀
Soooo smooth.....miss this kind of music and vibe ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
love it so sexy!!!!!!!
Bruno is just good in live as in the radio. So proud! What a hit maker!!!! And Anderson Paak together they killed it.Love this song.. and how they bring back the classic style. So good in the ear! Real music!!!!! Real artist!!!!!
Taking me back to when music was music ...
*sings with the song*  there's an album coming soooooooooonnnnn!!!!
No one lip syncs better; love this version’s ending.  Classy.
Kings ;-;💞💞💞✨✨ they sound exactly like the recorded version 😭💞💞💞💞💞
Bruno Mars doing it like an old school fool!  Thank you for bringing real music back!  I love his new group "Silk Sonic!"  Timeless Baby making music! #GRAMMYs #BrunoMars #SilkSonic #2021Grammy  #LeaveTheDoorOpen #love #thankyou 🎊🎊🎉🎉🎉🎉🎈🎈
NOBODY DOES IT LIKE BRUNO!!!!😍😍😍😍🤰🏽🤰🏽🤰🏽🤰🏽🤰🏽
Coolest thing I've ever seen 😎
Once AGAIN, Bruno Mars did not disappoint. He is The King of Eclectic Musical Genres. Anderson Paak also is a Great artist. Kudos to both of them! 👏
Crying.. literally crying 😭
Im leaving all doors open from now on winter and summer time
All in favor of adding the Grammy version to the album, say I
It’s like the good old fashioned quartet but with a modern twist. I love it 🤟
Thank you Bootsy Collins for suggesting that they do a collaboration! Magic!
Awesome performance! Smiling from ear to ear!
silk sonic!!!!!!!!❤💙❤💙❤🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿
Yo!!!!! I didn't think this song could get any better!!!! But this right here live version is even better. I can't wait for the album. When I play this in the car other people in their cars be looking at me crazy because how I be singing and moving...... I don't give a damn though, I be singing my heart out
Smooth, Silky, and Litty all at the same time
Sexy and smooth 🥰❤
This was amazing
Bruno & Anderson killed it.
Live or prerecorded, Bruno Mars sounds like silk and satin.
ready for the album
This was amazing. Love the collaboration!!!
The Temptations and Jacksons would be proud of those 'steps'!
FUCK YES!!!!!😘😘😘😗😗😗😍😍😍😍😍
So very amazing and awesome!! I expect NOTHING LESS from Bruno!! Welcome back, Bruno! You have been soooo missed!!!
Paak giving me David Ruffin vibes 🙌🏽👏🏽
Love this.
Who knew that actually singing well could sell :)
This song makes me so happy good job guys
I'm so loving this!!!!
In Puerto Rico in the seventies, I was a little boy, and my older brothers drank a drink that was based on Coca Cola and Ron, listening to this spectacular song is like going back to that time.
Never disappoints 😌✋
oh yeeaahhh everybody was feelin themselves, especially anderson :)
So Good !
Those voices are amaaazing. This album better win a Grammy !!
🙌🏾🙌🏾
Kudos to my baby D’MILE for producing. 💯💯🎶🎶👍🏽👍🏽❤️❤️
Bruno is sheer perfection ❤️
Dam, they took it back.This is just pure gold.👑
Bro why do they give me 90s vibe ? LOVE IT I
I have the full ENGLISH lyrics for this song.
Wow I never thought that I would get nostalgia off of a new song. This is awesome. The only complaint about this awesome performance is that the mics were missing that long ass cable that always got in the way lol. Flawless song flawless performance!
I haven’t been this excited for an album since 24K
Anderson Paak, I love his voice I've been a huge fan, this right here is bringing music back...My daddy in heaven would be proud to listen to this, feel good music🙌🏾🙌🏾. Waiting patiently on this album😍😍😍Love you Bruno🌹
Go away Rona, we need concerts 😭
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
OMG!   Love this, the 70's relived  and the Temptations come alive.
They absolutely killed it!!! Loved it!!!!
Vocals were served!
TOO CUTE
the out fits tho!!! lol  Love the track
This is my first time i heard this song , omg i love it .
Im coming thur baby !!!!
No auto tune and sounds even better than the music video. These two are absolute filled with pure talent. Cant wait for the album!
love them
I can't take it no more...drop the album now fellas...I mean rite now!!! I think I speak 4 all those who loves gd music, lol!
Tremendous.
That was awesome
Damn bro every single dude lost his girl for 4min and 16sec 😭😭💀🤦🏽‍♂️. Some of em didn’t even return 💀
Oh snap, The Weeknd introducing performances now! 💯
I have been listening to this for the past two weeks heading to work and to hear how they effortlessly matched the notes on stage as they did on the record has my freaking mind blown while dancing. It gives me that old school temptations feel with the dance and man I love so much about the way y’all put this together the video the Grammys all of it I can’t wait to see what y’all have in store for us! #brunomars #andersonpaak #silksonic
If this song doesn't make your soul speak, you need to re-evaluate yourself
Made my lil GenX heart happy...
Match made in heaven.
Ahhhhhhhh! *(Screams in teenage fandom skreech)*
I HOPE this is the returning of 70’s era music 🎶 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽 Bring BACK DISCO / FUNK / BALLETS
They better tour together !!!! 😭😭😭🤎🤎🤎 this shit flawless
They. Killed. It.
I love this!
I’m sorry, but besides them delivering a perfect vocal and step routine that would make Old Motown such as The Tempts, The Top & The Pips proud as f’k, I can see Silk Sonic taking this to whole another level in promoting this by turning this into an HBO musical comedy series like a Curb Your Enthusiasm or Kevin Hart’s Real Husbands of Hollywood cuz they have so much charisma
This was dope.  Somehow, Marvin Gaye's family is going to try to sue them.
This is so epic and I absolutely love it.
When this came out on the 5th, I've been playing this non stop. I was excited for the performance! And it doesn't disappoint!
this feels like the music that raised me cant express enough how much im loving the vibe.
I love this performance and Bruno and Anderson.paak sounds so great together.
This is NOT homage to to 70s r&b, this is   "culture jacking", just like Bruno's idol before him .. Bruno = Elvis 2.0!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Dang ! this song .  My Lord    just perfection !
I must admit I haven't followed you or Andersons career. I'm over 45 years of age and love and miss real R&B. But I fell in love with this song immediately. Oh my God this is what I've been longing for pure soul, R&B. I'm a music lover and this song spoke to my love of music.  Please continue to put out great quality music such as this. Great Job! I will buy your album if the quality of music is similar. This song is incredible and on constant rotation.
Phenomenal 👏🏾 I love it 🥰
Bruno hitting them high notes oooook
um both of their singing is beyond effortless i could listen to and watch this forever
Love Love Love it! Great job guys!
Those harmonies tho !! 😍
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😚😍😍😚😚😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😚😚😚😚😚
This song is everything and then some. These guys are so talented!!!❤️❤️❤️
Bruno Mars killed this
They killed this✊🏽💯
Yessss
Brings back that 70s soul. Wwwhhhoooo
This and redbone are going to be my top 2 songs to clean to on the weekends when I have kids
It’s crazy because people keep calling it Bruno’s song featuring Anderson.Paak. Anderson has one of the most (if not THE most) viewed tiny desk concerts and has put out a few critically acclaimed albums. They better put some respect on that man’s name.
Excellent
Well we know where all the grammys goin next year🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yo the ending AP wit the “WoOOooS”
This song should of came out on Valentines Day 🌟🌟🔥🔥
I love GOOD MUSIC
This stage is bringing me back to the treasure era.
This video makes me smile....
Incredible!
And that is how it’s done. Another performance for the National Archive.
Finally love music..Love the group.... outrageous dancing ....Thank you...
Its been so long since I heard a panty dropper song. Goodness!
Yassssssssss!!!!!!
Absolutely loooveeee 😍... I would love to see this live! Lol wrap me in bubble wrap and a mask 😷 CONCERT PLEASE 🥰
The key change sent me straight to heaven and that high note at 3:20 felt like shaking hands with God himself 😭😍
283 dislikes!!!  Must be huge fans of "mumble rap."
They killed that!!! 🔥
Please don’t drop the album. It’s going to make my wife want another baby, spare me
Incredible
This collab is a blessing!!
Breezy im so happy for you bro 😭😭😭😭
Anderson is SINGING!
yup I saw it on tv it was fire
People still fuck with Hollywood? haha
I just makes me sad that there are still people that do not understand why he is making this kind of music. I want him to succeed.
This song is the modern day Boyz II Men-“I’ll make love to you”
The Best of the Beat!!!!!!
Shame that most of the attention goes to Bruno. Anderson IS CRIMINALLY underrated.
It was the 11th hour and humanity's future looked bleak. This 21st century Motown Philly Soul frequency single-handedly redeemed the masses. And for this we are ever grateful.
Harmony personified
Man I need an album and a tour! Y'all are untouchable!
The live version kills the song
As a fan of The Stylistics and The Delfonics, I am adoring this in every way possible!!! So hot!
Good job guys
Love this. Great song guys 🎤🥁❤️
Baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaby
All the ones who dislike this song is because they leave the door closed..... there....I said it.   I love this song 🥰
Perfect song they sound better than the recording
That 70s suit is fly af
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Reminds me of old groups. Temps, Four Tops, OJAYS. When music really had a meaning!! Nice Grove guys!!
Bruno Mars is Amazing. He has that magic touch✨ What a flawless performance. The only reason why I watched.💯❤️🔥🔥🔥
Vocally, they speak pure SOUL! This is what MUSIC looks like when it is collided with LOVE!💕🎶 Bruno's vocal perfection makes you feel it in your heart, and in your soul as music should! He literally feels every note, every word, every melody! Their melodies compliment each other and reminds the world of what music SHOULD be, and once was! Heart stopping performance fasho!!
Dressing like the Chi Lites  I saw the background singers doing those  Ojays steps
Long time never it hear master piece really music  carajo que canción tan chingona
Im so happy Bruno is back!!!!!
they will win album of the year next year
welp... we know who’s takin all the grammys next year
Everyone that disliked this has Covid
MASTERPIECE
Omg their voices are liquid GOLD 😭😭 name a better duo !!     I’ll wait.....
Bruno Mars looking like Hector Lavoe.... must be the Puerto Rican side of his DNA....singing his ass off.
This was awesome!!! Need more of this!!!!
I prefer the 60th Grammys Bruno Mars Performance
Man that was dope!!!!  Them boys good!
Phenomenal!!
this is insanity
mom!!! MOM!! Brunos backl!!!!!
Such a vibe! All I can think of is the *SPINNERS & STYLISTICS*
Old school vibe....took me back to the 70’s & 80’s R & B/Soul Groups from Motown/Philly Sound...
Yuppers.
So much talent!
THIS IS A PANTY DROPPER 💯
When it’s so fire you can’t tell if it’s a studio B version to a track or actually live... Silk Sonic is 🔥🔥🔥
I love this song reminds me of the music my dad use to listen too ❤️
Sha mon!
Shamone! ❤️
As if I couldn’t be more obsessed with this song
Mad Temptations vibes from this performance! Love it!
This is how you romance a lady! The entire group is on point!
Sang boy!!!!
Genius in action. This is what's lacking in today's music. You may have just started the rebirth of soul.
Yes real music fasho in 2021
who else has been waiting for this performance since it was announced
flawless
I’m speechless
The 70's are back in so many ways and I'm loving it!
Best performance of the Grammy's!!! Silky smooth has a whole new meaning!!
This has been a long time coming.  Thank God soul music is making a return.  The word needs this! Romantic, sophisticated and soulful.  Let's hope it's not a trend,  yet a return to a much needed element of our culture.  Love songs. ✊🏿 Reinventing Energy And Love...
Fire🔥🔥🔥🔥❤❤❤😍😍😍😍😍😍
What would these new artists do without the soul artists influences from the 70's...Good you learned Bruno  because great music never gets old
OMYGOODNESS!!!!! LOVE!!!!!💘💘💘💘
FIRE
Whenever Bruno Mars graces us with a performance life gets better on earth
Ooops sorry, it was the video before this one.  This one is perfect thank you.
Love this song and performance
290 dislikes you can't be music fans.
Hey!!! That was a tease. Not cool.
I am Loving the Old School vibe. I am a Big fan of both artists and I really enjoy their collaboration.  I could listen to them all day.
Duo i didn't know I needed. This is just soooooooo awesome!!!
LIFE IS AMAZING OMGGGGF
My 12 year old daughter has an a old soul and loves Bruno Mars as much as I do. Now we love Silk Sonic and Anderson Paak. We rock out to this everyday.
Jesus. Christ.  I am blown away.
Something about the way Bruno sings “Open” sets my soul on  🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
When a person in his middle 40s who never liked bruno,  then Bruno comes out with something like this,   and he really likes it.. and it's reminiscent of the 70s style of R&B music,, then Bruno,   You did something Great..much respect.. keep it up.. teach these youngsters some good "love her up" music.   Keeping it clean and simple.. that's what's up.
This is like the smoothest thing ever. Wtf. I'm real life mad I didn't write this lol.
Boys is killing it, love the outfits and it's live. Real music and real voices. You can drop this song back 30 years ago and it fits. A lost Temptation Song.🤔😁
They bodied this
This gonna be the biggest album since thriller.
They absolutely killed this. I already knew they would.. I missed seeing Bruno on stage because he loves performing. I’m so proud of him! Love you Bruno 💗

Definitely a duo I never knew I needed 🥰
That 2nd verse and the fillets!  Let’s get!  Leave that door open!

Anderson hit us wit a “Go Demarcus” run at the end for cultural purposes
Silk Sonic album #1 isn’t even out yet and I’m already hoping they deliver an album #2.....and a #3
I’ll be there .
autotune is not in these mans vocabulary
Oh my God, how good is that??!!  They KILLED it!!  💕 Why would anyone give this a thumbs down??  You either love it or you like it.  It just isn’t possible to hate this song!
bo bobo bo bobo bo bobobo
I love them

Geez, can their voices get any sexier?  Where’s my boyfriend?  I need him like right now.

I’m over here about to passsss outttt at work lmao 😂
They didn't have to go so HARDDDDD
Good.
Now thts how u do it!!! Back to real Music....

Golden voices
John 3:16-17 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. 17. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9. That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen
PERFECTION
I’m so proud that Anderson is finally getting the spotlight he deserves. The man has been underrated for years.
So this is how sammy davis jr looked like when he was young?
I love Bruno Mars dirty draws. This man is so soulful and talented.
This song and performance is so damn fantastic.  Like it slaps!!  UGH I'm so glad Bruno is back and this duo is a dynamic smooth like butter combination
Now this is music hell yeah
Bruno is one of a kind
Honestly I love it, but reminds me of New Kids On The Block!!
@ 3:21 I just don’t know what to say
BEST PERFORMANCE 🤯🤩
oooooh! that transition to lead singer from anderson to bruno was so smooth
Don't get me wrong I love the studio versions of Bruno Mars songs but when he Sings them live 😍😍 they sound soooo much better 😌
They was so on point.... baby brought the 70s back with a bang... Next collab O’Jays, Isley Brothers, Teddy Pendergrass maybe let’s go
BM u r such a selfless artist. Thanks for giving a stage to this very talented guy AP. You are phenomenal as usual !
😍🥰😍
I can't get enough of this song. It's on constant rotation. ❤️
Well alrighty then...now please hand over this album.
Wonder what happened with Phil Lawrence and the Hooligans. Maybe I just wish they are with this success too.
To think him and bruno begged to do this 🙃 man them Grammy people must’ve been off drugs especially with the way the awards went
too nice wit it
Awesome 👏🏾
Can't believe bruno had to post an open letter to Grammy's for a spot, Best Performance of the Grammy's period...
Bruno Mars sounds exactly the same he does in the music video!🤯
Man i thought Dave Chappelle was unleashing another side of himself.
WTH? 😱 Before I read that this song is a remake, I 🤔 "😲 they are awesome 😎! Music isn't made like this anymore." Great job!
I swear Bruno and his boys always makes the other performances look like garbage
Well... K-Ci and Jojo's "All My Life" officially has a worthy successor.
Love the Bootsy like glasses on Paak
Bruno NEVER disappoints!  Love it!  Old school with a dose of today. 😁👍🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Wow wow wow! The notes hit...the vibe.... everything!
The vocals, harmonies perfecto
I love this!!!
I KEEP LISTENING TO ITTT. I CAN'T STOP. So good lol
Anderson .Paak deserves all of the shine. Hard carry on this song.
🔥🔥🔥❤❤❤
I love bueno!💕
Bruno said no extra! This is  very extra!
Tell 69 to pack it up, bruno is here and is saving music. From mumble and lean rapping to classic jams that will be in everyone bbq playlist and to our parents thinking this was back in the day where we gotta remind them our generation of music not so bad with people like bruno. Whats ya favorite artist comment down below!!! IM BRUNO 4 LIFE!!!
It's disrespectful how folks didn't know paak  before bruno dude has a nice  catalog  it's plenty of talents like paak needs to be in the LIGHT hopefully neo soul/R&B would thrive like it used to be this has  potential be the greatest neo Soul album in the past 10 years or so
This kind of talent does not happen over night. Bruno and .Paak deserve evvvvvrrrreeeeyyyy bit of success they receive. I am so happy Mr. Mars is back. I can be happy again ☺️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
The dislikes came from gen z who like mumble rappers
Love This Song
Hate that English black guy..ugh
Oh my goodness this is So fire 🔥🔥 🔥 🔥  🙌🏽♥️😘
From breezy lovejoy, to performing at the Grammys with Bruno Mars.... 🥲
Perfect match they killed this shit 🔥🔥🔥🔥

Bruno looks like my Filipino uncle singing karaoke
They remind me of oid group like the temptations stylistic and others group need a lot of that real music can't stop writing about them brovo

Why is this man perfect?!
Everyone’s talking about Bruno. Yes he’s amazing but can we talk about those great notes from Anderson too? I didn’t know he was that good.😍
Literally took me back to the 70’s. There’s nothing Bruno Mars can’t do! ❤️🥰🤟🏽🎤
Bruno Mars still underrated
Dope son Word 2021

Did you repent yet Bruno Mars!!!! Seek our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and get out of this Evil Industry, you have enough money already. Seek God he will protect you!
Song so good...I think I’m pregnant 🤣🤣
2:17 you’re welcome
While most of the so-called “artists” today will be forgotten with the passage of time, time will prove to be Bruno’s longest and lasting friend. Talent never fades, and unfortunately, the grammy’s don’t award talent anymore.
Wow great performance
They tore dat thang up...I actually thanked God for letting me experience this song, can't wait to see it in concert
My future husband. Been waiting for you.
Luminous public access TV vibes
oh my fucking GOD that was GOLLD!!!!!!!! WOW <33 God bless them for THIS JAM!!!!!! XOXOXOXOXO!
bruno singing like rent was due
0:55 that was so Smooth
Anderson has been dominating his genres as a multi-talented singer, drummer, rapper, rockstar, and sex symbol since 2016. BETTER NOT SLEEP ON HIM!
So this is exactly how I imagined the video would be when I first heard the song lol
i am looking respectfully 👁👁
Bruno is such fire 🔥
My Mom would have loved this.. Rest easy My Queen..
woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo
Bruno’s voice is so angelic and his dance moves 😍
Bruno should cover album of old school love songs
Why the hell this version is not the Original Recorded Version. This is even more FIRE!!!!!.
THE WAY THEY JUST BODIED THIS.. IM EMOTIONAL!
Easily the  BEST performance of the night!!
ang sexy talaga ng voice!
Nice, just don't bring them clothes back please lol
Can't stop replaying the 2nd verse. Anderson lays it down so well. This version is superior to the original.
This is one of the best award show performances I’ve ever seen.
Amazing great performance Bruno and Anderson Paak Silk Sonic 🔥💯🔥💯🔥💯🔥💯🔥💯🔥💯🔥💯🔥💯🔥💯🔥💯🔥💯🔥💯🔥💯🔥💯🔥💯🔥💯🔥💯🔥
Live performance sounds better then the original recording. Love this Track
When Anderson says “I got fileetts” That brought me back to Lloyds “Oh Layy”
LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!! 🥰🥰
Come on now David Ruffin and Cornbread!!! 🤣🤣
That was amazing! I gotta check this album now
Bro chill ur vocals are to strong
God knows i love Andersons voice
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Now that's how you sing back up
OH MY GOD I LOVE THEM SO MUCH
When the live performance eclipses the recording.... that's talent.....
WHY YALL SLEEPIN ON DADDY PAAK.😭😭
People that disliked this are the same bts fanboys they suck lol
The show just like MV
Chills everywhere, simply amazing song and performance 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Alllll the vibes.... n Chills.  😍
Hold the front door... Is this song giving anyone else goosebumps like me??? OMG this is like audio crack to me. I for one am not a bandwagon jumper. I will love on some deep cuts before listening to mainstream, but who has the intestinal fortitude to withstand the smoothness of this track. #SilkSonic4Real
I'm 65 years old and I love this song Bruno and everything he sings Bruno old school sounds and his songs reaches out to everyone God bless you all love you all for life
This was performance was 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥. My crush on Bruno Mars continues to grow!!!!!!!!!!
Yup. Bruno being Bruno. Turning live performances better than the studio version lol
The people that disliked left their door open and got robbed.
They're bringing back REAL MUSIC!!! This is definitely on REPEAT mode!!! #fiyah
Outstanding!!!!!
This is dope ❤❤❤❤
this🤝dynamite  being the best performances of the night
This is...With out words....
Paak at the end sounded like Demarcus
So Trevor Noah dressed as the Weeknd to offset the snub lol.
THAT WAS SO ADDICTING WHATTT YESSS TALENT I LOVE THS PLS DONT STOP
I'm inlove again bruno mars 💘
I love this song so much. It reminds me of Motown sound. It’s a great combination of old school and contemporary music.
I thought the recorded track was the best, but Woooo!🔥🔥🙌 this is gorgeousness 💯
Thought Noah was the Weekend at the beginning lol
I like the ending here vs the fade out ending from the studio recording.
screw y'all im not buying a zoot suit in 2021. Not even for your Bruno Mars.
This is pure heaven! Pure perfection! Got everyone in my household grooving 💃💃💃
wow this was flawless. Bruno is such a good performer and his vocal are incredible.
Check out Anderson and Smokey Robinson, also 🔥
Paak is disrespectfully slept on
Love this song!
Such smooth sexy voices....
"Throw damn towel"! #Rocky4! Lol!
Andersons vocals are more on point vs the studio but Bruno's are exactly how it sounds on the record so I think he's part are lip sync.  Just my opinion.
Beast Mode Mars and Paak
ANDERSON .PAAK & BRUNO MARS “ SILK SONIC” STRAIGHT  🔥 🔥🔥🔥
This is the smoothest most perfect thing I’ve seen this year ooooweeee
The next generation of children are being made to this song
Love the retro vibe!
Just trying to figure out who didn't like the video.
I can tell you right now this live version is gonna be part of the history books of music
i'm glad they uploaded it on youtube cause i don't wanna pay for the stupud ass grammys - this performance is priceless
YEEEEEEEEEEEEES!
I’m ready to be serenaded, leggo
this is what live performances should be more like
Great performance
I try to tell the haters all the time that Bruno ain't no joke.. One of the few that can rightfully carry the baton for Michael and Prince.. Wish they had debuted this track at the  Super Bowl ! Bruno and Anderson have most definitely raised the bar once again !!!
Jeez this is freaking insane!!
This so stunning oml! Warm and smooooth
Yasss honey, Bruno embodies the inner most funkiest soul vibes, this man is straight 🔥🔥🔥🔥and sexy AF (Pardon) Kudos to Silk Sonic ....hey Anderson ... I see you too brotha.  Keep vibin guys 💋
Amazing. Everything about this performance is ON POINT. Anderson's vocals sound great, then... Bruno takes the mic and you realize this is how its done son. He's such a superior talent - vocals, delivery, performance and finesse. You simply can't touch Bruno Mars.
I really enjoyed this performance from the seventies.
Bruno and Anderson PURE talent, holy shitake mushrooms.
Man come on!!!! The boys done done killed it!!!!
The hottest song in the world right now!!!
Jeezus. Immaculate. Why do I feel like this was the best performance and I haven’t seen any of the others
Nobody performs like Bruno can. I have to find a way to see this man live in person.
Honest title: Leave The Door Open (Alternate Music Video)
Almost too much Amazingness to handle! This is could be the biggest thing in music history kid.
Shout out to videographer, special effects. Choreographer... all of that CAUSE THE WHOLE SET UP WAS 🔥🔥🔥 The performance was on point & so we’re the transitions.
How is the LIVE version better then the STUDIO
Bruno Mars HAS STILL GOT IT
I can't stop watching 3:20. Bruno, I didn't think your voice could get any better after each album release. You always blow me away with your performances. This is my all-time favorite!
Bruno never disappoints his fans. ❤❤❤
I fucking just shitted
Without a doubt by far the best performance at the Grammys.
Couples out there still waiting on your stimmies?  Bruno & Andy gotcha covered....SHEESH!!!  That was a masterclass.
True artistry🔥🔥🔥🔥
Anderson. Paak  Killed it!  An awesome vocal performance.
Best performance of the night
Mohammad is my #1 BAE 💕

God luvs you so much He sent Christ into this world (His Son) To minister and die on a cross for you. Christ  has risen from the dead. If you believe you will be saved.
Bruno you the best on the planet one of the greatest ever keep doing what you do and keep doing it how you doing it don't change for nobody
Does nobody else think Bruno is looking like a 1970s era Sammy Davis Jr this go round?
Wife: you’re taking forever in the shower!! I need help with the kids!! What are you doing?????  Me: 🎶 “wooo woo woo wooo woo woo wooo wooo wooo” 🎶 ok im done.. (after 30 mins singing)

Bruno Mars is a God damn rockstar. Man does what ever the hell he wants and he does it perfectly every single time.
Yo this my favorite song right now i swear they brought the soul back call it a classic
Damn...
Heeneen saaeeynr raadaa!!! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
They bodied that
Amazing
BOTH absolutely crushed it , such an amazing Duo!!!! But I’ve been a HUGE fan of Bruno for over 10 years , he is easily one of , if not the best male artist from the past 10 yrs to present .. his songs never miss
I imagine Michael would be similar Bruno if his career started when he was an adult and not a child.
My kids are going to stop talking to me if I play this song 1 mo' time!
BRUNO GOT RANGE OKAYY
Lotta babies getting born late December 2021....
Wow this sht is straight 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥
Silk Sonic:  Albums.....Videos....Apparel....

WHO HAS SOUNDED THAT GOOD LIVE IN THE PAST DECADE??? 🤔
The best moment of Grammys 2021

Silk Sonic has the best performance of the night! If you’re a fan, stop whatever you’re doing and search “ VIRTUAL REALITY by ALPHA MARTIN “ !
YAY
oh my goodness how do they sound even better byeeeee
Amazing!!!!
Wow they did their thing
We are witnessing a classic ladies and gentlemen, flawless performance! WOW
Childish Gambino on the remix? -- just putting this into the universe.
Are you kidding me?!?!?! Modern day O'Jays!! These dudes BROUGHT IT!!! Paak sang his ass off. Didn't know he could croon like THAT! They all performed the hell outta that shit. Most kids ain't gon get it right away, but the GROWN FOLK need to SUPPORT THIS ALBUM! We wanna take black radio back? Well request the music! Buy the records! They gon spin whatever is gonna get them the most listeners, right?  Let's GIVE THEM A REASON to spin this right here! Damn I can't wait to cop this album..
My God I love this song... Anderson Paak, Bruno Mars, sweet sexy soul music vibe... it’s PERFECT!!! 😍😍😍❤️❤️
Who else smile while listening to the entire song???
FINALLY MUSIC!!!!!
Full body chills!
I am playing this song out to the ground. I cannot help myself.
I swear the first time I heard this song I got vibes of Motown! Temptations to be exact, and they delivered!!!!!!! Anderson Paak reminds me of David Griffith and Bruno Mars is Otis Williams 💖💖💖💖. Thank you both for bringing MUSIC BACK 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Jesus H. Christ. That was brilliant.
WOO WOO WOO WOO WOOO WOOO WOOOO WOOO WOOOO 😩
Damn! They freaking killed it! And they did it so smoothly!🕺I really felt that *la la la lalala*
Gyat-dayum!!!
ANDERSONNNNN U SMOOOTH AS SHIT BOYYY WTFF
I couldn’t stop smiling while watching this whole video my face hurts ! Lol
all I can stay is their album is going to be funky!!! New school with a old school feel! I can't stop listening to this song!
Can you say modern day "Commodores?" Like slap your momma good... The kinda music you play once you get your kids asleep and you want that quality time between you and your spouse, or just a dude cutting the lights down to spend some quality time uninterrupted with him and the woman he loves. The lyrics alone remind me of Barry White,   presentation Commodores, delivered by the one and only Bruno Mars.
Bruno and Anderson are insanely talented. They inspired every song I made in the past year.
GameOVER💯🤩🥰🙌🏽
If you dislike this you must be homeless
Perfection!!! 😭😭😭
BRILLIANT
Hello yeah I'm buying 🤩😮😁🥰 They KILT that
That chorus brings me back to college 🤣🤣

Sounds just like the recording. Amazing both of you
Getting 80’s music vibes 🥰 so in love !!!
Anderson Paak 2016 freshman freestyle : “My son is Korean and he dance like Mj” 😂😂😂  Anderson Paak 2021: 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Anderson Paak high key carrying this song, he had bars for real.
Slay'd it ⚡⚡⚡

I’m in tears, I’m not ready, I love it here
I Just Hope That Everyone Making Music Today Hears This And Is Like "Damn I Gotta Step Up My Game" !  These lyrics are so classic..."I just shaved - smooth as a newborn" ...  AMAZING Song!!!
Bruno can really sing. He sound the same as if he is in the studio. He is gifted
3 piece suits and that collar....perfect match for this smooth song!  I can’t stop listening to this perfect song!
They did the DAMN thing!!!!!!
Remember.. PAAK and Bruno have a song from 2017 they’re still working on ;)
They killed it! Great job 👏

WOW! I am so happy the Grammy's got them in at the last minute!  I am so happy Bruno is back!
Damn it was a hard journey to get here because this video was blocked in my country Malaysia and other countries 😩
How is this better than the studio recording. Wow

I can't wait to see them do this in concert!

Y’all are literally ridiculous. Why would y’all shut the whole shit down like that!?! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
I can't wait for that Silk Sonic album!
I think this song and performance is the definition of smooth and dreamy. Like it’s literally the most heavenly thing that has ever gone through my ears and I listen to music daily.
So did we lose daft punk to get silk Sonic? 😩😭
How did they make this even better than the original?
Can we all agree this is the perfect duo for this type of music!!🤩🤩 They both have that soulful and variety of music taste so ya’ll know they gonna sound good together😌 Also Bruno’s voice is literally so beautiful ughhhhh!!😩😩🤩
Just came here to say Trevor Noah looks funnier than he is
Yeah I'm convinced this young man was born in the wrong decade
That first spin transition from Anderson to Bruno was so clean
BTS’s performance and this one were the only two of the night that were incredible! ✨
I hope this live version is on a streaming service
0:55 that slide out tho!!
1:58 bruno mars dabbing?
Sexy Sexy And Did I Say Sexy.. Absolutely Nothing Like Bruno Mars So Much Love For you
Anderson. P 👌🏾👌🏾 I love this song!
213 dislikes are people who came home to a door that was NOT left open for them.
Breathtaking performance!!!!!!
These mofukas made 1 SONG and already touring with the shit!!? GODDAMN !! they on a MARVIN,AL GREEN, DAVID RUFFIN TYPE LEVEL ...  “AINT NOBODY COME TO SEE YOU OTIS “
this is the duo of the fuckin decade.
i love the pure genuine love  get from hearing them singing
Can’t believe this was live 🤯
I didn't know this song could get any better...
Very well done fellas! 🗣🎶
Looks like there's gonna be a few more babies getting made! lol
I didn't know Dave Chapelle and Bruno made a band.
I HAD CHILLS THE ENTIRE PREFORMANCE ARE YOU KIDDINGGG
This song is str8 🔥🔥‼️‼️🔥🔥❤️
Bruno Mars is giving me Sammy Davis Jr. vibes
both of them ate equally !!!! ain’t surprised either
This is how the video should've been !!
This is the most soulful song of this year. Im grateful to these two for giving us some old school R&B. 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 Now who is getting married to this jam?
from Breezy love joy days, to NxWorries, to being features on Dr. Dre's music,  becoming an icon with The Free Nationals and multiple amazing solo albums, and now Silk Sonic.... Andy has surely come a long way. :,)
Now THIS is real talent!
world class performers.
Overhyped bullsht
My door aint got no locks is open.
BEST performance of the night! 👏🏾 💯 🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 hella yeah!
Bruno Mars ALWAYS delivers it! #BrunoMarsSLAPPS! 🤩🥰😁
Awesome. I love to hear the little changes that Bruno does when he performs songs live. Him pairing up with Anderson was genius, this and the intro track are cool can’t wait to hear the rest of the album
The 4 member soul singing group era is back!
Okay I'm excited for this album
Love it!!! Could watch Bruno  sing alll day n night long xx
I need Bruno and Miguel to do a song..... I can hear now nothing but vocals
Love this song so much!!
Mmmm
R and B is back Silk Sonic with Bruno Mars!🎶🎶💋💋❤❤🥃🥃
ayo they all drippin HARD
They play too much and this was absolute perfection.
Bruno is so smooth I can't even deal.
Great performance by some smooth badass sound making performer's! Cool beans 😎
I am soooo loving this oldie vibe!
Brings back so many wonderful memories of Motown and Spandex.  Best time for music.  Glad to see Bruno back.  Real music.
Anderson. Paak is pitch perfect. Bruno Mars was BLOWING. Already an instant classic
This song is overhyped and sounds like a copy of a copy of a song. Mans took two or three classic songs put em in a washing machine and seen what came out. Even said "Shamone". Can't make this shit up anymore.
The transition  between them singing lead is amazing
Bruno looks like a Hawaiianversion of the weeknd lmaoo
Amazing
Why does this and his 24k album not count as him appropriating black culture? Bruno Mars' name is Peter Hernandez. He is not black yet he heavily plays up his racial ambiguity in order to cross over into black genres, and blacks allow it. Like how he opened the BET awards with the song Perm, and everyone was okay with it just because he "acts" black and wears his hair in an "afro".
Excellence
Amazing!!!! That is the kind of music we are missing nowadays!! I'm old school and i love what they did!!!
Bruno tweet came true! ❤️
Why does the guy presenting them look like the guy performing, and the other guy performing
This is truly a DREAM TEAM
LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN I'M ON THE WAY...LOL  Now this is what I call music keep it coming
Hope they get a Grammy for this next time! 😍😍😍
bruno’s music literally saves my life since i was fucking 5
Anderson & Bruno are total snacks OMG. 🥰😍
I would hire @Bruno Mars for my wedding I ain’t even ever having!! Always beautiful 🤩
This will define our generation’s tastes of music.
Love ur music
Okaaayyy we need music like this again
🌺
Yaaaaaaaassssss!!!! Yes , yes , yes and another Yes 😂😂😂 I love both of these talented men❤️❤️❤️
I like the vibes
30 yrs from now we’ll be watching these with our kids at family functions 💜💜💜
I don’t k now why but I love your songs from like 3 or 4 years ago but my favorite are talking to the moon and Versace on the floor.
We missed yall kings
Finally some new Bruno Mars ❤️❤️❤️
211 people literally have NO SOUL!
I’ve never heard artists that need auto tune less than Bruno, and now Anderson
Dis is liiit
So smooth. This track is already legendary. Love it 🧡✨
So dope!! Need more of this Bruno and Anderson “SILK SONIC”🔥🔥🔥🔥
AHHHHH SO RETRO
Wow! That was awesome! The vocals, the rap, the smooth dance moves whew, I loved it.🎶👍❤.Truly a fan from Hartford,CT. Leonora🤗 Silk Sonic you have a hit, great song!!❤
Unreal
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
They sound fantastic. Bruno sounds so much like the record he sounds like he is lip syncing 😭😂👍🏾 3:19 This is the first time he deviates from the studio version, And he takes it up a notch 👌🏾
Can we get more of this RandB
Pure talent
The best performance. Makes me think of me and Mrs. Jones and blue magic with the chi-lites. So sweet
FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
A MASTERPIECE
God damn, Even better than the studio version. Amazing!
So is no one gonna mention how clean that spin at 0:54 was?
ANDY KILLED THIS!!!!
Bruno is so darn sexy when he sings!
These two are reminding people that love versions can be better than the original.
Out of Body Experience - Breezy Lovejoy aka Anderson Paak = Most Slept on Album.
They even did the old school fits!🙌🏾🙌🏾🥰
DAMMMMMMMMN
These talented men are single handedly trying to bring back the much easier way of the 1970 vibe. 😎🤟💚Great work..
They can gone give them album of the year right now just off that.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Real sanging and performing!! Stacked talent!!!!!
I am loving all the vibes from this!
Anderson... we are really proud of you bro... from struggling to take care of the fam in LA, gigging everywhere, writing, drumming, doing tours, becoming established, dropping that last album, to being part of one of the illest duos I hope we've ever seen. You've done a lot my brother... and we here for it.
Great song! We need more music like this. 👍🏼
These two coming together is a dream come true
Anderson Paaks woo woo woo is iconic lol
202 people don’t leave the door open
BEAUTIFUL 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
I’m tryna figure out who are the 200 ppl that gave this a thumbs down. None of y’all know good music.
The ruthless discussion acly jog because text universally flood on a ritzy barber. ten, brief softdrink
Orgasm to my ears that I haven’t had in a while 😭👏🏾
PERFECTION 😍💜💜💜💜💜
Legendary‼️‼️‼️‼️🤟🏾🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Amazing!!!
If this is your first time hearing Anderson.Paak and you liked it, I BEG you listen to his discography. I personally love Malibu (my favorite) and Oxnard
Ive never heard a song and immediately wanted the album so bad in my life.
It’s the hip thrusts for me 🥰🥰🥰
Very cool, but they were lip-syncing to the record. Nothing live going on there. Check it out for yourselves.
Love seeing talented artists creating history. We will be talking about this beautiful song 20 years from now. 🙌🏽♥️🙌🏽
Well damn Bruno tell us how you really feel lol
199 people accidentally hit the dislike button 🤔🤷‍♂️🤦‍♂️...😂  Fire🏁💪👌🎤🔥🔥🔉
To my fellow millennials: We finally have a song we can one day brag about to our kids. This is TRUE musicianship, and it's timeless! 😍
Everything Bruno touches is gold.
those heart glasses fire asffff😫😫
Anderson Paak is the Soulful Dave Chappelle LOL
Bruno Mars is a musical Genius of this generation! 🔥
I've been waiting 5 years for Bruno to release music and it was worth the wait
Timeless...
This song is the audio version of *GETTING A FRESH HAIR CUT & LINING*  Only for your crush to say...               It was never about the hair cut    *Ive always wanted you*
WOW!!!!  Just……… WOW!! 🔥❤️
I LOVE THESE MEN, THE FUNKY VIBEZ ARE JUST EVERYTHING!
Ba-ba-buh-ba-ba-BAD!!!! 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💎💎💎
The lesson from this. Never be afraid or to good to ask or even beg for something you really want in your life. I'm not talking about something you woke up & decided you wanted but something you have worked possibly your entire life for & possibly something new that you & your other 4 time Grammy award winner have also. Never be afraid to ask. CONGRATULATIONS SILK SONIC
YESSSSSSSSS
we needed Bruno back on the stage
Autotune needs him
when he said shamone it started giving me micheal jackson vibes
Bruno mars doesnt need autotune
Omgggg I’ve been waiting for this for forrevverrr seen Anderson first became known 😭😭💕💕
If you don't like this, you ain't got soul.
I feel like this is the type of music bruno ultimately wanted to make and now that he has that star power behind his name, he can do so and still be in the mainstream, which is so dope.
🗣🗣🤭🤭Imma leave Da 🚪 open🎶🎵🎼🎵🎼❣❣❣
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥I love it 😍🥰🙌🏾🔊🎶🎶🎶
✨✨✨✨✨✨✨
Yaaaaaasss!!!!
How dare you @silksonic?  1st: 🔥🔥The song is SCORCHING🔥🔥 2nd: You gon' kill me with this performance? Imma need the authorities!🚨🚔😳
Not worth the hipe
BBBBBBBEst grammy performance ever!!!!
Best performance of the grammy's this year
This is what you call a performance ❤️
My God! Everything about this was just freaky good!  Killer song, arrangement and vocals were perfection. And that Soul Train vibe - Yes!
Old school love music is what the world needs
Damn this is good😌
Amazing performance. Love the 70's music the most ever, and this was most definitely 70's style. Gorgeous vocals, arrangement,  everything was right on. Anything Bruno Mars does is excellent. Love that guy! Love Anderson Paak too.
That was like the best thing ever 🔥
These are true artists. I don't leave comments often, but this performance & song deserves every accolade. I'm lovinggg this 70's vibe. I've always been an old soul, so I've always gravitated towards 70's, 80's, and 90's music since I was little. This song is just absolutely everything. It embodies so many classic elements of old school rnb into one beautiful blend, and their voices sound incredible together. Both Bruno, and Anderson did a wonderful job on this song. I've had it on repeat for dayssss lol. Also, they can SINGGG!! True artistry right here
I love this song ❤❤
The people who disliked this song should get a covid-19 test done, because one of the symptoms is NO TASTE.
I didn't think it could get better but the live performance was
You know it’s good when you think they’re lip syncing
Real Talent.
They are killing it!!!!
I love this 70s theme!!! Glad they let them perform ❤️❤️
Needed it :)
This combo basically will make you throw the controller at the t.v. This Jackson phenom level.
Trevor Noah is repulsive
That’s the best live performance I’ve ever heard
Is it me... Or is Bruno Mars... Starting to look... Shocking similar to... 👇 Trevor Noah 😱
YES LAWD!
This is the greatest duo ever.
I swear this song makes me melt 🥴
Best song of 2021 😭💗 I know the year just started but I’m confident.
who else here feels confident that we're in good hands and 2021 is going to be okay? Silk Sonic is everything this year.
OMG what the THIS IS INSANE
BRUH SO EFFORTLESSLY CLASSY & SWAGGY
The Manhattans, The O’jays, Marvin Gaye, DeBarge vibes right here 🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊
THIS IS THE WAY IS DONE YOU RAPPERS  NOT THE SHIT YOU PUT OUT THIS IS REAL MUSIC AND HOW IT DONE ON STAGE I WAS BORN WITH THIS TYPE OF MUSIC SINCE THE 60S!! I MISS THIS SO MUCH THANK YOU SILK SONIC!! HOPE YOUR GUYS NEVER BREAK UP YOU WAS MADE TO GROUP UP AND SING TOGETHER, AND YES I LOVE THE OUTFITS LOOK SO SWEET!!!!
Now THAT! Is music!!! 🎶
Excellent!!!!!! Love this ! Lalalalalalalalala ahhahhaahhhahhhAHH
Amazing! Can't wait for the whole album.
Perfection 👌
STANDING OVATION!!! OMG SO GOOD! Whoever thumbs this down clearly has sh**ty taste in music. There are not enough thumbs that I could give this.. this is too amazing!
Check out R&B Soul acts on the Midnight Special.
And....I’m pregnant .... 🤰🏻
Chills the whole first minute Edit: the whole song
This is the only reason I watched the grammys
Now that was smooth right there 🔥🙌🏾👏🏾🙏🏾🕺🏾
Yesssss!Real music by Real Musicians Everything was Amazing even the choreo was on point and they singing singing 🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌❤❤❤❤❤❤
I like this song.  Bruno Mars! Those olden day vibes!!
Soul train vibes at the Grammys2021#silkSonic #afan
The BEST part of the G show! Brilliant ❣️❣️
To think that they had to beg to get to perform! And I'm so happy that they did. Hands down my favourite performance. #Obsessed
That's just some wicked humility right there! For Bruno to put Anderson upfront as a lead singer tells you a lot about Bruno's character. Bruno has already cemented his name in the industry like no other.          BRUNO knows he's a bad arse and most of us have never heard of Anderson until they came out with this song.  Nice version of the song....just gonna create a playlist of this version and the original one and let it loop until I'm sick of it...LOL. might even break out the polyester suit when I'm feeling it..hahaha
their voices are so sexy 😔🤚🏻
These dudes done brought the SOUL back! 🕺🏾🕺🏾🕺🏾
Alarm off...my door open like mf for this combo🚪😮😍😍🥰🥰🥰
HECK YESSS
I know the dislikes be nodding their head 😭😭😭 THIS A FKN SLAP 🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊
I'm I the only one, making love making moves, all by my da$n self
Gotta be the best performance of the night,  Sheesh, that first verse and bridge is EVERYTHING!!!! They killed this jawn.
Best ever! Love it!!
Fireeeeeee!!!!!!! Thanks for keeping real Music alive guys!!!
FOOK THE GRAMMYS
Now that’s how you do it!👏🏾
They be thrivin' ~
The best melody 🎶 ever ❤️❤️❤️❤️ I’m in love 🥰 this the best 2021 😍😍🥰🥰🥰🥰
Dang y’all killed this
Throwing my pantalones at the phone.😂
Best performance of the night
playback speed 1.25x 😅😅😂
Bro, 187 people watched this and hit the dislike button. Ain't no way man.
Use Grammy to release another MV on the same song. This track and this dou is something else man!
They killed it lol
This performance takes me back to the days of the Midnight Special television show. Anyone remember those performances? Great song! On my playlist.
That couldn’t have been live.
Now This!...Is Musik!!!
Shamon!
Bruno,I’m trying to lay in your arms..What’s your address?!!!!!😂❤️😘
This the third time I've listened. I CANT STOP!!!!
Give me more 🤩🤩🤩😍😍
I’m speechless this is music!!

The talent is unreal
Fucking BEAUTIFUL!!!🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
Can't go wrong with Bruno Mars❤💯🙏

If Paak goes on concert again I swear I'll travel as far as it takes to see him
Blast from the past. Reminds me of Soul Train.
Love
Leave it up got damnit. I'll take all your of u.
How did they even out do themselves more than the original! I didn’t think it was even possible!! Got me absolutely SICK I’m SPEECHLESS I can’t evennnnn 🥵😩✨✨✨
That alternate ending ❤️🔥❤️🔥❤️🔥❤️🔥❤️
Now this is what real artist doing like, this soul music look how the look while singing! That's how you know someone getting pregnant while listening to this song. That soul music 🎶🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
I already know when their album drops, I’m listening to it nonstop for the rest of this year. that’s a fact.
Stop being so fine 😫
Really the only performance I looked forward to. I love it 😭
Amazing my brothers!!! Vibes
I really hope this album is this good throughout! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🤞🏻
literally a month ago I was wondering what happened to Bruno then this sex goo of silk sonic came into our lives 🧡
They KILLED THISSS
J💖A
Notice how with all the other performances they cut to other performers watching.  Not with this one.
💚🔥🔥🔥💚
TALENT.
The Slide Bruno And Paak Did On 0:54 Is Under Appreciated
✨👀💣🔥
BIG Temptations vibe right here!
Lawd have mercy on them vocals. All I hear is just smooth butter. Goosebumps. Great job fellas!
I've waited for this performance all night. They are simply amazing together. I've always been a Bruno Mars fan and now I've officially become an Anderson .Paak fan also.   Flawless Performance!
Bro this is better than the video and this is giving me jackson 5 vibes
everything about this is just perfect
This is true rhythm and blues and Bruno Mars is undoubtedly one of the greatest male vocalist of our generation.
You can't tell me this album isn't going to be stacking up all the grammys next year once it drops. What a combo!!
I got pregnant listening to my fav! yass Bruno we having twins daddy!
Wow!! Amazing Performance!! Both Very Talented Guys!! Can't Wait till There  Album Come Out!! We need more music like this!!❤
They are cold cold.
We are not worthy 🙇‍♀️
The 160 people who disliked this are probably the same people on twitter calling Bruno Mars a culture vulture...
Cold ass song... dude said if you hungry... I got filets lol
Can't wait for this album, can already see the haters lol
This song is like finding a mimosa and a foot massage in your pocket after doing laundry
Looks like it flew right out of the past into the present! Looks like an actual 60s show lol
Bringing the 8s back. Yes!!
This certainly sent some chills down my body and spine, because those vocals almost killed me with divine power. 🤯🤯
I can’t believe how good they sound
King von punching the air rn
Glad to hear some real voice tunes.🥰🥰👂🏽👂🏽👁👁
Omg this was so got damn good and classic!
For the ones who clicked thumbs down on this, you obviously don't have any soul, this performance is flawless, it was that spin out from Anderson to Bruno for me.
They're both have a great voice but Bruno Mars voice gave me goosebumps.
Amazing
Wow! So retro. Fantastic.
this is so fucking beautiful
Anderson and Bruno are literally the perfect match for each other musically. They’re styles go hand in hand and they’re voices sound great together. Really glad this is a thing
Yes real R&B music is back in 2021 let's get it,Amazing Performance!!!!
TALENT IS BACK!
The duo we didn’t know we needed
Now that’s what I’m talking about. I’m 55yo  and that is soul music right there. Thank you fellas ✌️🙏
this is gonna be trending
I always say about Bruno's music style could not get any better and then he comes out with this.
It's CHUM ON OVER FOR ME!!
beautiful
This song has awakened a spark in me that I’ve been missing out on for the past year. Not a single movie/album/etc. that came out during this pandemic has made me excited for the future until now. I honestly cannot wait for the rest of this album ❤️
yesssssss love everything about thisssss!!!!
The song that ends COVID
they’re sweeping the grammy’s next year.
This was fantastic 👏 😍
GOSH DAMMMMMBBBBB this songs SEXXXXEEE as hellll....
This just curled my toes. Damn that was brilliant!
The only reason I watched 😍
Definitely prepared for when it’s 20 years from now and I’m seeing this on the after hours soul r&b commercials lol
Holy shit...This was amazing   Night shift gang wya
Bruno mars❤️
Absolutely AMAZING.
Old school vibes. So smooth wit it. 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
niccccceeee.. just like in my times that takes me back to my youth.. need more of this kind of music not that other crap (won't mention what that is).
Bruno is my man!
My goodness! 🔥🔥🎼🎼
Right on brotha right on 🤜. *rocks side to side picking out my fro*
Trevor noah could've been a body don't for bruno mars minus a mustache
They make it look so easy, that if you are not paying attention you won't get it! This shit is what 😳
😍😍😍
A sign that real r & b is coming back.
Leave the open door is my favorite lyric
This that Good ole Suga daddy with keys hanging from the belt loop music! That Tell ya momma Otis outside! Lol hot shit!!
They’re so talented it’s insane to me
Take note all you modern day pop artists, this is how real music is done. Real instruments, real voices, perfect synchronization, perfect harmony, perfect breaks, and clear & obvious passion in performing what they crafted from the bottom up live. No lip syncs, no sung over pre-records, no beat from some electronic device you paid another producer big money for to lay down garbage vocals ya half-wrote. Good for you if you can make money and get the views for the short time your songs are in rotation, but music like this lasts forever and will still be played long after we are dead. The start of this song, you already knew it would be amazing. This album couldn't come soon enough!
Dope performance and stage set up..just wish they sang the whole song rather than synch it.
So glad they got the recognition they deserve. Now more people will get to hear this beautiful creation.
Oh Lawd!!!!! 😍😍😍
LITERAL GOOSEBUMPS!!!!!!! I DIEEEDD
Yassss. Go ahead Anderson Paak.
Absolutely Fantastic, this is Real Music, Real Romance, Real Talent, L❤️VE, L❤️VE, L❤️VE, I’m here for this👏🏼
that ending though!!💯💯
I think these 2 together they can rule the airwaves forever.
Gonna be bumping this in the summer cruising the PCH🔥🔥❤️
this should’ve WONNNNN a grammy omg
Me watching this before it hits 1 million views: 👁👅👁
i cant wait for the reaction videos to this. It is incredible
this deserves to top the carts it’s crazy how amazing this song is oh my god
When Bruno says “oooppeeenn” 🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴😳😳😳😳
Bruno got it. 10/10 🔥🔥🔥 he always DELIVERS
dude the fact that this is 100% live is AMAZING!!!
Anderson has been dope for years but man I feel like these are the best vocals I’ve heard from him. Bruno is definitely bringing out the best in him 💯
Delphonics, Stylistics, meets Jackson 5
This is sooooo good. But the "boo-boo-bou-bou-boo-boo-bou-bou-booo" of Anderson at the end was so FUNNY😂😂😂like he was saying:" y'all listen to me, don't mind bruno"😂. IT was so suddenly.
These two gentlemen are magic together Anderson and Bruno is the perfect combination
Dios mío esto es lo mejor que he visto
Performance I was waiting for all night!
gd the choreography
The live version is way better than the recorded version
I enjoyed this
they sound JUST LIKE THE SONG
This song is fucking epic! 😭
Eargasm
Vocals ✨smooth like a newborn✨
You guys were amazing!  Now on to a tour!!!!
Wow
This song makes me want to trust love again
🔥🔥🔥🔥
I think I’m pregnant
Excuse me, time to make a baby
How f*****g fire is this!
Bruno where is the little Richard video?
I’m gonna assume the dislikes are because it wasn’t long enough, since the performance was 🔥🔥🔥
So, is this a dp/pig r situation b/c both dudez are singing to her? Curious minds want to know....prayers for me folks please! Its been a tuff March!
Everything Bruno touches is gold 🌟  Everything Anderson touches is magic 🪄
I mean c'mon..that performance was beyond epic..
The genius musical executions of this single is immaculate  Melody  Lyrics  Production  Bridge  The artist  Absolutely immaculate
The enthusiastic basketball feraly puncture because insect semiannually deceive along a auspicious peanut. lamentable, wanting riverbed
Where’s Phillip Lawrence??!!!???
I love everything about this song. What a classic in the making
I like this ....oh yeah
😉 My soul needed this!❤💃🏾❤💃🏾❤💃🏾❤💃🏾❤💃🏾👏🏾..👏🏾..👏🏾..👏🏾..👏🏾..👏🏾..👏🏾
Channeling the #Whispers, #ChiLites, #Spinners, #Temptations...don't get no better or no more ol'school than that.  Gon' have ALL the Baby Boomers at 'dey concerts...Smart ass strategic move...and some dayum good music!
How can someone like Dua Lipa even take the same stage as these guys?
This like some temptations to the 100 power,
what an awesome performance can't get enough of this song love it so much
I tell my boys all the time,,” Real, true music, is from the soul...and will remain timeless across generations!”  This amazing song/tribute to old Motown is a beautiful breath of fresh air amidst the clutter of all things Pop.  Love me some Bruno, and this journey with Anderson is on point!  Cant wait to have this album on repeat!!
Yaaaasssssssss 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Y’all Did Thaaaaaatttttt!!!!!!!
Yesss!👍
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
DAMN!
Hey now love this old school vibe look like a soul train act
This is so good omfg 😫
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!! Please bring this realness back!!!
Apparently 160 people have their red hats on too tight.
What!
I'm loving the Temptations position switch Anderson and Bruno kee doing.
Best performance of the night and they kept their clothes on 🤞🏽☺️
God, Bruno Mars is SEX.
This performance made you reminisce about high school talent shows , soul train 🚆 house and skate partys and driving in the spring with the top back.
Yo! How in the HELL do they sound better live than in the recording? My jaw is on the FLOOR right now....
a train id be happy to ride 🤷‍♀️
PLEASE MAKE MORE MUSIC TOGETHER!!
Performing the song at the ceremony that’ll give them all the awards for it next year
Damn them pants ...  🍆
Truly slik sonic
I guess Anderson .Paak replaced Philip Lawrence and is an upgrade in terms of vocal ability. It's nice to see Bruno Mars back at it again with another smash hit.
I feel things...let's just leave it at that lol
we've not heard from bruno in a while, but i love how his voice remains unchanged and performance unchanged as well. never seems to let us down every time!
They sound so damn good.
This is one of the few performances that sound better than the original recording
This is sooo beautiful! All I can say is wow! 😍😍😍😍😍😆😆😆😆 I knew Bruno wasn’t retiring early lol.
I'm getting Stylistics vibes and am lovin' this song sooo much...!!
This is SO good
The way that this is just dripping in energy. Better than the studio recording
The camera work, the outfits, the glasses, just everything about this. EVERYTHING.
I’m 65, and they reminded me of the 70’s and soul hits by groups like Blue Magic, even the Delfonics. I’ll be first in line to buy the album. I’ve been waiting nearly 30 years for a true soul hit. Hey music industry, this is what its about. Love the bell bottoms and the soul train lights too. My era of music!
This is just to good great job
They both did amazing! Bruno always delivers. I didn't want this performance to end and I wish I could've heard more of Anderson Paak, I feel like his vocals have improved immensely since his tiny desk performance. I'm loving this duo!
"I won't bite... Unless you like!" Soul that cuts like a hot knife through cold butter....
This is timeless. Imagine if more pop music was made like this, rather than mindless mumble rap and vulgar pop with crap lyrics....
This was soooooo great!!!! Amazing performance. I downloaded the song immediately on iTunes
Timeless classic 🚨 #letsgo
they killed it
Please put this on spotify 😩😭
The transition between their verses is spotless holy
They make a great duo
It’s too Good. I’m overwhelmed.
I really felt the soul in this performance, from the suits to the backdrop, this was dope( In my coming to America voice ) “ That Boy Good” !!🤣😁😂❤️❤️❤️
Hey Rita, come watch the tv! Dem boys good...Sound like the Stylistics!!!
Silksonic did an amazing job.
This NEEDS to be #1 in trending.
Wow!!! I swear this is straight from Philadelphia soul!! Teddy Pendergrass, O'Jays, Stylistics, Delfonics, Spinners - you can feel the influence and inspiration! Just when I was losing hope about today's music.
See that shoulda been Don Cornelius  introducing Silk Sonic #Classic
Come on man. I need to sleep.
Shyt pyr🔥🔥🔥
i genuinely can't tell if it's tracked or not but either way it's so beautiful
Earth’s population will significantly increase 9 months from now.
Man Bruno never disappoints
Raphael Saadiq  had an album back in 2008 called “The way I see it”.   It is similar to what Bruno & Anderson are doing right now.  That album was fire back then,  I hope these guys have the same success on the new album.  I really hope this inspires groups like the 80’s & 90’s had ( Shai, CMB, Troop, Jodeci, Hi Five, etc). To make a comeback.
this song tickles the best part of my brain
Lawwwd they killed it. Purely MAGICAL!!! It's been on rewind since they dropped it. Anderson and Bruno's voices mesh so well together!! 😍😭
Amazing work fellas!! 👏 👏 👏
Ready for the tour!!!!!
Maybe Bruno Mars doesn’t want us to sing his songs.
Not gonna lie, I am impressed by .Paak’s vocals. I wasn’t expecting that.
If this isn’t lip-synced Anderson really surprised me. Bruno is the goat as always.
Bruno the fucking man !!
THEY SOUND SO PERFECT
sip sip
Yes!
I’m speechless  The Jackson five experience  The golden taste of genius music performance  Forever Bruno Mars music
So fucking good.
When they first switch, the spin, gotta be the smoothest thing I've ever seen.
Underrateddd!!!!
Bringing the oldies back in style with new school players.  I listen to a lot of music as well.
This felt more like a music video than the actual music video
this is truly amazing awesome performance ever those harmonies sounded like osmonds, jackson5 you guys slayed it killed it and those matching clothes like the 70s awesome
We need a Bruno Mars and The Weeknd colab ASAP
okay, am i the only one turned off by “just shaved, smooth like a newborn” ?! 😟😬🤢
i love this sonnnnnng.!!!!!!
I absolutely LOVE how Bruno Mars and Anderson Paak both sound the same live as they do on the song! That’s real natural singing voices. Love it
0:54 that was so SMOOTH
Anderson channeled his inner David Ruffin and Bruno channeled his inner Eddie Kendricks! I absolutely love the song and they killed the vocals and choreography!!
They are definitely the few of the last real artists we have. 😭😭❤️❤️🎶🎶🥺
this was a master class, this album will be a no doubt classic
Flawless! Damn man you took a perfect song and made it gooder lol! Yea I said it gooder damnit!
SAAAAAAANG BRUNO
FLAWLESS...OMG.... REPEAT IN HIGH
OMG!!!!! I am so in Love With Bruno, the first time I heard him SANG!!!! I knew he was Going to be an ICONIC SINGER. He is so young but, but soooo OLD SCHOOL IN HIS SINGING/PERFORMANCE. I CAN LISTEN TO HIM SLL DAY. Now Andy!, he can SANG TOO. Together the are PURE MAGIC.  I sure Miss the Old School groups back in the day where they coordinated their outfits. Hurry & out this NEW CD OUT!!! LOVE LOVE ❤️ 💕 💗
I WANT THIS SONG ON VINYL NOW! This entire performance has my ovaries acting up, this was flawless, the production, the vocals, just *mwah* chefs kiss
All night I have this song on replay in my AirPod
KINGS ARE SAVING MUSIC
How many times I’ve rewind each part?
Anderson showed he can really "sang". Bruno was stellar! The showmanship was on point!! Love the original, but w o w!!! This live version took it up a few notches. Such a great move....song comes out, gets millions of views, the grammy's is close, they p e r f o r m, they kill the performance, and take it to a whole new level of greatness. 👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾
And that’s on Mary had a little lamb! 🔥
My last name is anderson
Awesome
There is no denying the talent here. Who's ever this brain child this is, they have GOT to be proud. I am quite impressed gentlemen. Well done. Quite right. Well done.......
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Thank you!
I sing that song every day! OMG!
The thing about Bruno Mars is that he always sounds like or better than the recording.
Bruno is just a master ...everything he touches is Platinum / Diamond and some space metal that ain't been discovered yet..a legend for real
Looooove the retro outfit and dance moves. I can't stop grinning throughout the song, the vibes are just too good!!
BRUNO IS EASILY THE BEST LIVE PERFORMER IM THE LAST 13 YEARS OR SO NO DEBATE. EVERYTHING IS ON POINT HIS DANCE MOVES, HIS VOICE, HIS STYLE, HIS FINESSE...
They gonna need more security after this
So... can Covid go away so we can see them in concert?!?
Bruno the black community proudly claims u now 🙏🏾🙌
*_"Ooohpen"_* ugh so _beautiful_
Fuckkkk, this is AMAZINGGGGGG
Oh my panties!!! 💦
Wow does this take me back to old school, Soul Train, and Saturdays. Had to help clean house with Pine Sol of course it was the shit back then. After got to sit, and watch Soul Train, the Soul Train dancers, and Don. Bruno doing it up right with this baby making song. I'm buying this CD for sure. When l listen to this on my Bose the neighbors do too.
I didn't think the song could get better until I heard it live.....  T A L E N T
Yassssssss, I’m gonna leave the door open yesssssss,yesssssss and more yesssssss.
I love this performance. La la la la la la!
Silk Sonic blessing us for 4 minutes straight. This song is an actual masterpiece.

They gave me what I was expecting which was amazing and perfection, they sounded great
Wheres Mr. Phillip Lawrence ????
The best career advice that I learned is don’t ever attach your-self to a PERSON, a place, a company, an organization or a project. Only Attach your-self to your mission in life and your PURPOSE. That’s how you keep your power and keep your peace!
They just brought Motown back!!!! Two of the greatest of our generation!!!!
This song is excellent and extremely smooth, but Bruno Mars!! Imma need him to change it to Bruno Bars, his vocals is everything!!!👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽❤️❤️❤️💯
WOW! Real music, nice to listen to.....
This was SHEER PERFECTION!  I CANNOT EVEN DEAL WITH THIS! Just the pure joy of listening to unaltered  music... This is the most beautiful thing I heard this year! Drop the album, we are waiting!!
People who think this is lip synced 🤡
Okay David and Eddie that was phenomenal!!!
This proves Bruno Mars needs no autotune if he sounds just as good live as he does in his recorded music😍
2:15 who else felt something right there.....????  The tone sent my body I don't know where....
This is giving me Soul train vibes ughh 😭😩😩🥰🥰
I feel like if you've heard anything by these artists before live you'd know this would end up golden, but damn... Shit's magic.
Omg that was perfection!!!
Anderson and Bruno, so smooth!  I can't wait for the rest of the album to drop!!!!!
REAL TALENT: Fun fact they’re making a new album. It’s directed by Boosty Collins 😩🥰
Timeless
Dope af🔥🔥🔥❤️
Making RnB   Real soul music mainstream!!!
I am living for this retro vibes! It's so refreshing.  I am In love with this song.
Damn i hope silk sonic releases an album, that’s an immediate cop. Loving the nostalgic vibes

This. Is. Gorgeous.
This is some REAL CLASSIC R&B ! Freaking Fantastic 🔥🔥🔥 Makes we want to skate and have a backyard Bbq ! ❤❤❤

WOW........ speechless......chills

Not the 70's temptations dance moves 😂😂😂😂😂 not gonna lie I hit them same moves to when I hear this song, especially the shoulders, they are CRITICAL 😭😭
I’m so glad this song is so good and it exploded cause Anderson got the recognition he deserved ❤️🔥🔥
WOW WOW WONWOW
I think the audio is Pre-recorded. If it isn't and there's no pitch correction, then wow.
They said “We gon kill em with this outro!”
They 🔥 the stage up. Bruno is a bad Vato!
Best Performance of the night
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Wow wow wow, silky smooth swag cmon men!

Yassss Bruno! Yassssss! These vibes! Amazing!!!
Now this is Real music...❤💙💃🎶
I absolutely adore Anderson’s second verse. ❤️ Replay
The Temptations, Four Tops  2021! That's Old School!
The beginning is just my favorite park of the song
Bruno's best vocal yet. Paak was so smooth in his first line omg. #SILKSONIC
Barely realized he says “fillets” not “the lays” lol. I’m even content with lays idk
I am losing my mind over this performance
The intro is gold lol
This song is honestly soooooo gooooodddd
The singing is amazing but those lead singer switches were SMOOOOTH
Man I'm gonna make some babies off of this song..Seventies style🤣🤣
This is so fucking good!!
I'm so glad more people are gonna listen to Anderson .Paak after this.
Yeah I hope young artists start emulating this.
This was insanely good. I can’t wait for the album
Only great artist/singers can sound better than the studio version of a song. Silk Sonic will be fuckin amazing!
Bruno Mars is the greatest singer today! They deserve a Grammy for their work!
This song is soo good because none of them need auto tune and the song sounds the exact same
Best performance of the Grammys
THIS WAS- WOW
If they were a band they would have hits left and right 🥺
My god, this sounds EXACTLY like the recording. This album is gonna be amazing!
I'm not from 63rd 😂😂😂       Someone had to say it
I leave the bathroom door open when I drop duece now cause this song is so dope!
They sound so good! Honestly better in person than then music video!!!!!!
This was amazing ICONIC
WOW
heran bgt ga si ga rekaman ga live semuanya bagus bgt.
I didn’t watch the Grammys and won’t but I’ve watched this video no less than 50 times!!!!!!!
They both did sublime <3 !
PERFECTION!
Where can I get the heart glasses...someone?
Lawwwd!!!😫😫😫😫
This is phenomenal.  I feel like I'm in the 70's. I love the camer work and effects. They are such a perfect combination. I can't wait for the album!
This is one of the best recordings so far this year , hopefully it will be the beginning of some change at the current state of the music industry .Today’s music it’s the worse I’ve seen in decades, so bad that now Grammys are given to anything but real talent .....
I had forgotten how great Bruno's voice is!!
Bruh, how could they make a version better than the original?!
Yesss Papi Bruno and Anderson!
F'in Awesome🎊🎉🎉🎊Song of the year for me hands down! Sends Shivers down my spine I swear🎊👏👏👏
When men actually sang and entertained....
SO SEXY, SO FRESH,  SO SMOOTH,  SO COOL real music!!!  That's what I am talking about
Man.. when bruno is performing live, he's gonna make the song more difficult for you to even sing.. Same with paak.. their live gets you more excited than the recorded single. 🔥🔥
I LOVE THIS AHHHHH❤️❤️❤️
The simutaneous spin in and spin out at the end of the first verse was so flawless. These dudes showed up & showed out!
I love how artists like this don’t just make sure that they can sing their song live but BETTER than the recording 💜
FLAWLESS VICTORY💯
SO GOODDDD
y’all ate that up!!!! loved it 🔥
This was flippin epic, AND BRUNO WAS SO CLEAN with his notes. hot dayam!!!
Bro to think that this is live. Really sounds like it came straight out the studio.
The 145 dislikes are from poor souls who truly have no clue about showmanship, talent or soul music.
Me recordaste a Sammy Davis Jr., y todo el glamour   de la musica R&B de los 60's y 70's. Gracias por esta genialidad.
Live > Studio
This song is a banger!  Ok wait, has Bruno gotten sexier over the last 5 years...??
this is the highlight of 2021 so far
Their vocals sounds so perfect live😩😩😩
"I'm sippin wine.... in a rOoObe" that run was too clean! 0:35-0:38 love this live performance nd the song is sick <3 always on repeat lol
Even better than the music video! Amazing!
I can not wait to see them live one day😍😍
i missed bruno mars more than anything
Ive waited 3 years for bruno to make a song and this is amazing 🤩 the note are 📈📈📈 and the song is 🔥🔥🔥
THEY MURDERED THAT ALL DAY 💯💯💯💯💯
Ooooweee chile! those voices, visual.. lyrics don’t even have me sad that I’m single.. that’s how good the song is😩🎤🎤🎼💞
Amazing, one of the best collaborations of all time❤️
Please they’re so perfect
omg this was so electrifying yassss!
I was about to be hot if he didn't hit that "Wooo wooo wooo wooo wooo wooo wooo woooo". That's my part that I sing all the time.
My heart went pitter patter 💗😍🥰
Love the 70s throwback
The cure for the corona virus blues.
I thought I would be one of few people that just loves the '70s and the '80s, to find out one of my favorite artists is bringing it all back in such an outstanding way, I want more of Silk Sonic, they inspire me to be a great musician ❤️😊
They should have performed during the superbowl
Wow the best music 🎶
Best song 2021
AMAZING!!
That was the shit!
if this doesn't win hella grammys next year imma be mad asl
This whole performance is exactly that — a PERFORMANCE!! I’m not sure whether I should laugh or take my clothes off 😍 these two are 😘🤌
That was a hell of a performance
THESE EXTRA VOCALS ✨😂
OMG!! THIS SONG RIGHT HERE IS FLAWLESS. THE LOOK. THE CHOREOGRAPHY.  THE SOUND. SILK SONIC I LOVE YOU❤ GREAT PERFORMANCE
Sheesh 🔥
They are like the classic R&B artists with this one. I hope the album has a lot of this!!
Those stepouts. Its the old school my mom played but with new flavor!
These two literally cannot miss
Anderson hit EVERY note! And that improvisation and modulation is AMAZING!
Can we get more talented artist just vibing with each other!
omg
Oh my God!!
Loooooove!
4:05 Bruno’s voice went PLUS ULTRA
Oh wow 🤩
Oh Bruno bring it on back!!!
All the garbage performers with big lights and costume changes and huge bands...Silk sonic comes out and shows what real talent is!  No big flashy showing just good music.
Badass song!!!
They are LIVE?! They actually singing live!
i didnt know i needed this tell i got it :')
Chills. They may be the most vocally powerful duo of our generation. Their voices are exactly like the record, smooth like silk. Im obsessed.
The only reason to watch the Grammys
THIS WAS BEAUTIFUL.
Nothing like music you  can listen to and feel the words.  I love 💘 this song ... Fabulous Job ... I just love that old school groove
Woooow 🔥🔥
This song just came out and they already performed it at the Grammys lmaoo shit is already a classic
This is awesome!!! This is what music, singing, and performance should look like...not some “strip club sideshow”!
Holy fucking shit!!!
God this is so smooth!!
0:55 That transition by Anderson to the mic stand was smooth 👌
Bruno and Anderson are godly and all, but Trevor Noah!
AMAZING PERFORMANCE!!!!
Btw....Paak I needdddddd those glasses!
Omg Bruno Mars looking so fine here
I love it! So smooth. This song reminds me of the classic r&b groups like the Stylistics and Spinners! Keep up the good work guys!
I need their album to drop NOOOWWWWW!
So beautiful!
Everything!!!!
Oh my god I think I’m pregnant with this song lol take about magic never a disappointment you guys are fabulous an smooth an hot!!! Sexy as hell💋 so dam talented with no bad words in your lyrics it’s refreshing to here that!!! Expesaly when u got young people listen too your music 🎼
Majestic. Wow.
🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾✨✨
you just knew that Bruno would be coming back in a really big way... I'd be honored if some Bruno Mars & Anderson Paak fans who appreciate 70s/80s classics would give a quick listen to my acoustic piano & vocal YT performances of PURPLE RAIN by Prince and WHEN I WAS YOUR MAN by Bruno in tribute to 2 all-time greats from different generations. Live acoustic with no enhancements. Peace & everybody stay safe.
This impregnated me
IM LITERALLY WATCHING THIS VIDEO SMILING
I wish I had 20 thumbs for the ups! Nostalgia at its finest. Keep up the great work! Woooooooooo!
OMG!!!! I CAN’T WSIT FOR THIS TO COME OUT. SHAMON!!! GOOD GOD they can SANG!!! SO OLD SCHOOL WHEN MUSIC WAS MUUUUSAC! Love love ❤️ 💕 ❤️
WHAT DID I JUST WATCH? AMAZING
Prodigies..  legit high level music talent.  So refreshing.
My god man.. true fucking talent right here
Omfuckin goodness
Bruno out here looking like Puerto Rican Sammy Davis, Jr.
Nice~
except for the last part w/ bruno & anderson paak.  totally live.
😍😍😍😍😍😍 speechless... Love it
Anderson needs to just sing and stop rapping on his albums. He has this kind of James brown funk style to his voice. He had more of this vibe on his first studio album.
I didn’t know Dave Chappelle can sing this good.
✨👄✨ I shall like this and listen to it every day even when I’m in class ✨👄✨
Bruno and Anderson didnt have to go so DAMN hard. The song is already SO BEAUTIFUL. My gahhh. The live is so good
Damn the best voices hands down
God he has fantastic teeth
no low effort shit. this is why you pay to see bruno live.
0:52 THAT TRANSITION DOE
this was lip sync'd... whyyy
WOW!💞
THIS ALBUM IS GOING TO BE A GENERATIONAL ALBUM
How the hell you make it even better you bastards? Holy hell my wife is already tired of this song 😂😂😂 I hope this version is on the album too! Let’s freaking GOOOO!!!!
Set list of doom Good shit Andy and Phil!
I love how their glasses sparkles while they're singing... smexy. 😎😍
This is what you call born to do it! The grace and sophistication they possess cannot be learned, I have played it back to back for an hour now! And yes the live is better than the studio version 🔥🔥🔥
We need a whole album
On Fire 🔥 💯%
Yo this performance was unbelievable. Bruno and Anderson both somehow sound better live. So much energy in such a chill song. Holy shit!!!
Bruno and Anderson don’t needed auto tune, auto tune NEEDS THEM 🤎✨
Love this version ❤️
Holy COW!!! How are they that smooth??? And the fucking slick ass dance moves...shamon now....too good
Yasssss
Amazing performance 👏👏👏👏👏
Show announcer: welcome to the 2021 Gram-  Me: 👁👄👁 I’m here for Bruno and Anderson✌🏾😂😂🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
Dance on that carpet!!
These guys are on a different level
Anyone else thought Anderson said “I got the lays” like he was offering his girl some chips? Lol
Ya'll just don't know how glad I am to see a touch of ol school coming back!  (Do Wop) Those moves,  the groove, the high voice and tight harmony. THANK YOU!
This brought tears I love this live version!!!! Love good music
There ain't much music like this around anymore😢
Bruno still got it!!!!!!
I LOVE THIS
Just legendary. Artists at their very best.
Magical...I miss real music and singing like this! It's one of my favorite songs🔥🙌🏽💜
I was just talking about how i missed bruno Mars and how eveything he touches is gold. Missed you back and betyet yhan ever
more this, less tiktok
THIS is what music is!
This makes me so happy
I’m in my 20s but I grew up watching Good Times. That is totally a suit JJ Evans would wear.
And s/o to Anderson Paak finally getting the credit he deserves 🔥🔥🔥
GENIUS!!!! 👍🏿 Watch how many other performers try to go ol skool after this. It's ABOUT TIME!
breezy lovejoy in full effect, kid!
The way this performance is absolutely perfect what
They did that ending 👏 😭 love. Silk Sonic better SANG! ❤
Best Grammys in a long time, I prefer this format and I hope they stick to it (probably won't) bc we got to really focus on the showcases. Kudos to the director. By far the best performance on a night full of amazing performances. Now SilkSonic is going to carry us thru 2021!
💖💖💖💖
Bruno is an ICON 🐐
Part of me thinks: Anderson and Bruno are highly talented, why do an homage to the past? But, I love the mid 70s R&B/soul, the Philly sound, the Spinners---four or five dudes in polyester suits with synchronized moves. And Silk Sonic nailed it, totally nailed it. It's funny because Bruno and Anderson were born a decade after this sort of music was in vogue, good to see the younger generations appreciating it...
Silk Sonic Finna be Dope asf
This was nothing short of amazing. It's all that I wanted to see of the Grammys.
hot.
The King has returned.
Never knew I needed this duo to happen until I they released this song Their voices sound so beautiful together
I've been smiling for TENS MINUTES STRAIGHT. INCREDIBLE PERFORMANCE 😍😍😍😍🤩🤩🥰🥰🥰🥰
The Grammys got one thing right 😭
Finally he’s back. 👍🏽
Why not available for the Philippines?
I love the Philly soul vibe
Bruno has the best voice of his generation!
My boy finally reached his Super Rican status. You cant deny his Puerto Rican side now lol that facial hair and curly hair. Frankie Ruiz style ooook
Love Bruno Mars
THESE TWO CAN'T MISS. I'M IN LOVE WITH EVERYTHING ABOUT Silk Sonic!!
That spin 0:55
the. exact. same. as. the. studio. version.
Wow this song is amazing dam great ...bruno mars has no bad song
I’m hearing Bruno did a tribute performance in honor of the late Little Richard. I didn’t know anything about this otherwise I would have watched the entire show. Or at least until I saw Bruno perform again. Did anyone watch the entire show?
THIS IS AMAZING😍🙌🏾
Pure #Greatness Flawless performance
The raw talent like holy shit dude
this is one of the best performances i have seen in a long damn time
The Grammys didnt deserve a performance from these guys
I don’t know what’s cuter Bruno’s Afro or Anderson’s heart shaped glasses 😂 this was amazing the outfits, the backup singing& dancing!
Very nice
BRUNO FUCKING MARS
This is phenomenal.
Whole time I thought he said if you hungry, I got the lays
That first note that Anderson did 😊😊😊. I hope in this decade, 70s music will come back. We gotta leave the 2010s behind.
Falsetto 💖
They killed it and the Little Richard Tribute. Flawless Victory
Looks like I ain’t born in the wrong era no more 😍 I love this so much! Cannot wait for the album 😩
They did NOT need to go all out like that! Amazing performance
Yeaaaa I need this album to drop ASAP
The best live performance for 2021
I DON’T THINK YOU GET IT .. I’M OBSESSED 😍😍😍😍 .
OHHHH MYYY GAAADDDDDDDDDD😍😩
We need a full album!
Anderson's second verse got me feelin real different.
How can you dislike this song?
They absolutely killed this performance
AMAZING 🤩
If mars DOESN'T win next year for the song of the year , male artist of the Year, best r.b song ETC.   The Grammys have turn to utter crap. 😁😁😁😁  Mars is definitely better then the rest he is nominated for.
Those HARMONIES tho🎙🎙🎶🎶🥁🎹🔥🔥
Paak went CRAZY!!!!
3:19 ... bruno never fails to amaze me 🥺💕
Now this is music 🥰🤩
IM CRYING
Que bello eres
Wait! I can tell who the people are that put thumbs down..... wait i wont go there!
Bruno really be looking like every Hawaiian Islander father in the 70's. Makes sense since he was born here haha.
Motown, Funk R&B...plus Pop equals MAGIC.
STOP IT RIGHT NOW!!! Out here saving a whole generation 😭🙏
People need to be ashamed, talking about not knowing who Anderson .Paak is. And yes, there is a period before the .Paak.
Awesome, classy , and very talented 🤩 lots of love from 🇷🇺 Russia
The Style is just flawless
This is what the Music industry needs 🔥
I. Am. Here. For. EVERY. Note. of. This. Song. This is So SEXXXY!! Give it to me SILK SONIC!!!
O M Goddess I Love EVERYONE IN THIS PERFORMANCE THE MUSIC THE DANCING THE GENTLEMEN LOOK SO HANDSOME 😍 ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤💯😊😁👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Got that 70' vibe. Love it!
Omg this was FLAWLESS!!!!
They’re literally so talented, I have no words 😶🥰
I'm not even a girl but I think my ovaries just exploded...
Bruno makes timeless music and I've got a whole new respect for Anderson.Paak!! That sound is straight from the 70s!! Can't wait to hear the rest of the album!!
This was real cool and different.  Groove sounds  Bruno sounds   Great 👍
Bruno is sinking 3's like it ain't nothing. This dude is the Truth. He's on top.
This is definitely giving me the Jackson’s vibe
THIS IS TRUE GOOD MUSIC. BUT I JUST WANNA SOMETHING THOUGH, ARE WE GOING TO IGNORE THE FACT BRUNO MARS LOOKS A COOL ASS SAMMY DAVIS JR.
Beautiful 😻 🤧✨✨✨
real goat shit
lol Bruno Mars sounds Exaaaactly like his recording good skill
Flawless. Better then the original audio. As amazing artist usually are...
Honestly wish we had more mainstream music like this <3
I was waiting for this online lol
3:20 my god...
Us the blacks would like to draft Bruno Mars and trade Stacey Dash...
HOLD UP THAT OUTRO HARMONIZATION HUH?!?!?
Sooo sooo beautifully done in love and fun
I’m so thankful for this collaboration!! 😩❤️👏🏽
dream duo
4:08 Me when i hit my toe with a furniture.
Bruno always comes correct
Gives some 70s vibes
Te amo bruni !!!!!! 🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
This was the best performance of the night hand down!!! Real music and phenomenal vocals!! Bruno’s on another level of talent.
Anderson. Bruno. This is a match made in heaven
This is my song. Good vibes.
Yassss Bruno
this is officially the best group out
The best part of the show for me❤️❤️
How tf
There be a lot of conception going on with this song.... that how good this song is.
Im getting The Jacksons VIBES ALLLL THE WAY
All you can say is WOW 👏
1960-1980 video point of view ☀️🍀
I noticed that the other performers has a lot of production  props and what not but Bruno/Anderson's was just simple and more focused on their song and dance...Maybe Bruno said" just give us 4 microphones,a stand ,lights here & there, and we will take care of our choreography and clothes and we are ready to go!"
3:16 🔥🔥🔥🙏🏼💫🌎
So smooooth 😌👏
Perfect
My new favorite, Bruno Mars voice is oh my god!!!
They sound 🔥🔥🔥🔥
The collab I did not know I needed!
Right now the pop music industry is worried they're going to have to learn more chords, harmonic extensions, how to write bridges, outros, modulations, and have to sing with talent and skill...and I'm here for it.
Finally some good music with good vocals! This song is amazing...I could listen to this over and over again. Love Bruno is back!
After the absolute  trash the Grammys brought this year- this is refreshing.  BRUNO IS BACK.
All of you who DISLIKED this video can burn in hell slowly 🔥
Spectacular all around.
The vocals at the end 🤯🤯🤯 they not playing around
HOW DID THEY MAKE IT EVEN BETTER THAN THE RECORDED VERSION
just wow
love
They don’t need auto tune  Auto tune needs them 😭🤚
HOLY SHIT. This is unrealistically good.
Good music has finally returned.
AMAZING PLEASE DROP THE ALBUM NOW OR I WILL CRY
Mane, this suga honey ice tea was 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥.
I feel that Bruno was born in the wrong yr he looks so much like a 70 baby he style he voice larwd love it 😍😍 master ...
0:42 Anderson just changed his whole vocals for a sec and it was beautiful.
Obsessed 💕
HOW DID THEY MAKE IT EVEN BETTER HOW HOW SOMEONE TELL ME I LOVE THIS
Anyone know when the album will drop!?
Dave Chappelle got bars!
The song is like fine wine . . I’ve had on replay an unhealthy amount
Also fucking youtube annotations at the end, FUCK OFF. I wanna see them hit those heavenly high notes, wtf

Wow 🤩

This project is already straight 🔥 off of this one song! I can’t wait to hear more! Don’t let this sit out there all alone too long Silk Sonic!  I’m ready for more!
THIS WAS THE BEST PERFORMANCE, SO GOOD!
ALBUM PLEASEEEEEEEEEE PLASEEEEEEEE PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE THIS SHIT IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD
HELLLLL YEAAAAAA ITS ANDERSON PAAK'S TIME BABIEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
This album is gonna define our generation.. it’s gonna be so good i can’t wait
Okay. I don’t know why but Anderson seems like he’s singing live 100% and the talent is just amazing  But for some reason it seems very obvious that Bruno is lip syncing to a track.....
when my future children play this song in 30 years, i already know i’ll be saying “what you know about silk sonic!?”
Goosebumps all ova😏
Hands down, the best performance of the whole show!!! This is a winner. Bruno Mars did it again!!! Real music is back!!
This shit was beautiful
It’s the spin off for me 🥰🥰 Bruno is so magical and Anderson is dreamy
This is the *talent* I'm here for.
I love you ❤️ 👏🏽👏🏽
They need to keep these fellas together as a group bruh that's a power team
Well I can't stop watching this video. I'm convinced I'm addicted!! And I love it
Ooooo Bruno, marry me now pls 😩🥺
oh. my God.  this collab album will devastate records... Bruno part II for next year's super bowl halftime concert!!
This song is amazing❤️❤️❤️ two amazing singers combined ❤️❤️❤️
❤️❤️❤️
0:54 Did y'all catch that swivel transition?!!!
They are killin the game‼️🔥🤯
Honolulu,HI born yessaH bruno
Love it  :-) Nicely done with lots of references to soul music in 60/70 much appreciated that you are aware of where you come from musically.
Why Bruno look like young rock
Legends 🙏
I'm calling it now... Greatest song of 2021
Baby Maker 2020:Covid Lockdown  Baby Maker 2021: Silk Sonic
Perfection
A performance wow
This is real Grammy artist. Bruno!
Damn. Bruno really is the greatest artist of all time huh.
Thank you for bringing back this sound in music🎙️🎹🎸📻🥁🎛️🎚️
Bruno sounds incredible live, I quite honestly thought he was lip syncing at first 😂
Old skool vibes, I luv it. dis album gon be fire
I keep being blown away by the fools who hit dislike on this song.
God I hate Trevor
I have the Apollo show from Bruno and he killed it .. This seems to be his alter ego 🤓.  Think the kids got a future 🥳🤘👍
ATE IT UP
This is like watching good karaoke at a nightclub in a strange city when you're first plans fell through.
Simply amazing 👏
I love this fuckn song!!!!
🔥🔥🔥
As my parents would say "This is grown folks music right here"
Whoever shot this, planned  this, thought about this, all that! Need a Flipping Raise I LOVE THIS AND THE MUSIC VIDEO! Not disappointed whatsoever!
It's songs like this that we need to hear more of, just love, love, love it! Definitely getting it for my music library.
I luv Bruno mars vybe all the time...
holy fuck this is incredible
it's a great song. but "shut your trap" is seriously a terrible line. It doesn't fit in a distracting way that is bad. It would have been much better with "don't say that." It rhymes, has the same meter, and fits the emotional content of the song much better. Something like that.
Yes. Yes. Yes. Shamon !!
Brings back memories of when music was good!
I LOVE THIS MAAANNNN
That was AMAZING, BREATHTAKING & HEART-WARMING!!  This is my new favorite song!!  These guys just took me back 40 years to my high school days!  Bravo!!  👏👏👏👏
That was phenomenal
Wow!!!!!
BRUNO YOU KILLED IT❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Always a smooth groove
I love how they are working and singing together. I can’t wait for more music honestly pleaseee
Bruno’s voice is just- wow.. idk how to describe it
Bruno was Born to sing.
big bush energy
This song is just amazing
I hope the album is this fire 🔥
Trevor Noah and Bruno Mars are twin brothers. Omg.
is that trevor noah in the beginning??
Speechless
Too much yelling
I swear my dad had this same suit.
🤯 Amazing
Wow that was dope!!!!! 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Now that was way good!
Best performance at the Grammy’s and also BTS hands down!!
dude😀this is perfection
Jesus, this song is beautiful. The chorus sends chills down my spine. Reminds me of the Jackson 5 and New Edition. Lovely....
This is my favorite song along with KREAM
🥰 YOU ARE ONE OF GOD’S GREATEST CREATIONS. YOU HAVE A PURPOSE. IT’S NOT TO LATE TO TURN TO GOD, JESUS. HE’S WAITING FOR YOU WITH OPEN ARMS. 🥰
Took me back to the 1970's, Motown style. Love it!
Cocaine Music
If a candle was a song
Damn. SMOOVE!!
Love artists/songs that sound the same live as in the studio. You know they don't rely on autotune or anything extra
Omg this is live it's so crazy
Ayyyyeeeeee🥴🥴🥴💫🤍🤍🤍🤍🤌🏽
brought tears to mine eye wtf
2 of my favorite artist, can’t believe it
YES!!! I'VE MISSED MUSIC SO MUCH! THANK YOU ANDERSON AND BRUNO!!!!! YAS!!!
THEY DID THAT !!!!!!!!
I wish Chris brown made mature music . But he still on those booty licking tunes
Bruno’s vocals are insane!
Okay. Im buying this album. I haven't bought an album in years. Time to dust off the itunes cards!!❤
As if they needed to prove their greatness......
Trevor just can’t compete with Bruno’s Afro.
I love LOVE LOVE Bruno Mars sooo much Im so glad he preformed at the Grammys
Perfection , that’s all I can say
I’m gonna be first in line to buy a silk sonic concert ticket
This gives me a Jackson 5 vibe with Michael in the front and his brothers vocals in the back🙏🏼
I don’t know if there was enough sugar or the Insinuation of more sugar in the sweet tea, ladies?
Ain’t NO WAY Bruno just did that live what the hell man
ATE!
Be a fan since the “grenade” days love Bruno ❤️
Cool, they are bring back that real old 80's R&B. 🔥
BYE I'm obsessed
This was everything!
Amazing. 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
I think Im going crazy now ...
Yessssss!!!! 🎶🎶🎶💜💜💜👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
I knew I seen the 70s🎊🎉🎙️🎤📸⛸️
Sounds familiar
It looked like a parody but sounded fantastic.
This song sounds like they wrote it in the studio high as a kite eating, cheetos. Vocals are SIIIIIIIIIIIICCCKKKKKKK!!!!!
Fire fire fellas ! Dope shit. Haha
The way it sounds the exact same is incredible! This is the best combo ever, this is so amazing and soothing to my ears!
WOW! When does the whole album drop? Now THIS is REAL music!!!!
Anderson Paak killing it like usual
Fresh
I love it. Very special
Dope as fuck
I smiled the whole performance. Now that’s good music.
Was kind of sad to no band behind them. But then I realized they weren’t going to sing it like the album version and I instantly got locked back in
Bruno and Anderson are 2 of the most talented artists of this generation
toooooooooo good
Love real music makes my soul dance ❤️
Thank you Bruno Mars and Anderson for this spectacular song....
Bruno slaughtered this 💥💥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The switch between these 2 were SMOOTH ASF!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🐐
Bruno's still easily one of the best artists of our generation.
Man this put me in a mood to just wanna vibe like they did back in the 80’s and 90’s using their own voices and crazy improvs to just say hello to a woman. The old soul in me felt this all the way!!!!
I love this song, beautiful harmony by Bruno Mars & Anderson Paak.
These vocals are legitimately mind blowing!
Wow.
I’m watching this on tv right now!!
They honestly could have ended the show after this performance.
Best song of 2021.  Calling it now.  The debate is over.
Proud to say I was alive when this collaboration happened 🥰
They sound so good ❤️❤️❤️❤️ they just restored my faith in our music.
Silk Sonic bringing back hairy coochie music! 😂 👏🏼
I was waiting for this all week! Such a great performance. 👍🏾
Sweet Baby Jesus in a golden diaper music is back!
Yesssssssssssss🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥Bruno mars n Anderson  paak  silk sonic
Anderson/Mars is like MJ/prince. But the difference Anderson/Mars put their ego aside and make great music together . I love ❤️ it
One of the few good songs and performances during the clusterfuck that is the Grammies.
Truly some legendary I’m glad I’m alive to see this type shit
I can’t stop watching
Ooohhhhh how  I  love it. And how he sings. Bruno is so talented ❤
Aww I love the inclusion of the dancing in the back! Definitely accentuates the inspo of performances from 70s/80s
They never stop!!! Genius ❤️❤️❤️ this is how you bring real soul music back!!!
this is...really amazing. wow
Classic 70 vibe sweet and sexy  love song
Can't wait till this album drops
Perfect like always I have a song for you it’s different let me know
70's soul has returned...with a vengeance...leave the door open.
My infatuation with these lays increased by ten when he sang about it and I ain’t even eating Lays.. that’s true art. Thanks Paaak
I love that ending variation change. Man, that’s slow jam mixtape shit right there. ❤️
This is what I needed!!
i seriously thought home boii at the beginning was the weeknd
I'm all here for this Heatwave, Smokey Robinson, and Marvin Gaye vibes. What a performance! Can't wait for this album!
They took a perfect song and blew me away with the simple emphasis on some phasing just to blow our minds again PERFECTION
FLAW-LESSSS HOW THE HECK????
Haven't been this excited about music in a long time...
I love the oldies feel/influence. the routine & harmony gives off an oldie feel with a modern vibe.
Yesssss they beast this whole song.
Live better than the recording ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Gen Z: BTS is on top of the charts!  Bruno: Hold my Beer
Love his music. Bruno.
Not Anderson paak and Bruno Mars together please give us a album we need it
I really hate I couldn't watch this live and on the moment but even still I feel like I was there. Phenomenal
This type of music is long overdue. A modern oldie but goodie. Let's hope music takes a turn in this direction.
That swap at 0:56 with the mic stand so flawlessly done god damn. 😭👌
They got that early 70s Chi-Lites vibe with that look.
This song is starting to sound like I should call him 😔 love this track
This whole vibe just does things to me. I need a whole album
This. Was. Amazing. I was tooooo lit in my living room!!! 🔥
song reminds me of growing up in the 70’s, watching soul train saturday mornings, going out to play with my neighborhood friends after and mom& dad taking my bro and I to get thriftys ice cream ... love them times
wHY THIS SOUND BETTER THAn the single version?!
Amazing the whole performance
And to think, this is the first time some people are hearing about anderson.paak.
Never disappointed when it comes to Bruno Mars.  Such a great collaboration.... more please! 🥰🥰🥰
why did i think that was the weeknd at the beginning?
Awesome awesome awesome performance. I expected nothing less!!
M A G I C✨
This was absolutely INCREDIBLE!!!!!!
Hell yeaaa
This is nothing short of amazing.
Man so amazingg.
sooo good shit
ABSOLUTE CHILLS!!!
DAAaaaaaaaam  that was Goooooood!!!! 🤩
bruno so fine lawd
All I can say is. . . Bruno, you made me blush.  When my. . . friend forwarded your video for this song (I initially “sent” the song to him because it dropped last week and I really like it), I thought it was “cute.”  But this live version really is “on pointe.”  Now, it’s time for me to take cold shower.  hahaha
Who on earth disliked this video?  Tha heck??? This is fiyah!!!!! This is artistic magic! ❤️🔥❤️🔥❤️🔥❤️🔥❤️
Honestly one of the greatest performances I've ever seen
👍
OK. I'm a tough guy... But when a song speaks the truth...  Ladies, when a man is telling you that he has worked to prepare a place for you, EVEN WHEN YOU AREN'T SURE ABOUT YOU... Don't mess around and let him get away, or be so fickle you ruin the purity of your friendship!   As  a "Man's Man" Love Song to his lady, I rank this up there with "Lady" (Lionel Richie /Kenny Rodgers), "Send For Me" (Atlantic Starr), "Still" (Lionel Richie), "Shinning Star" (The Spinners)... It's a classic.
This was the best performance of the grammys by far! And with barley in special effects.
It was so good 😍
this is.... my whole life. this is TALENT. i have no words
Bruno is packed. 👀
Bruno is always bringing something different to the music scene. Incredible talent
Crying 😭 😭😭😭
They did that I’m here for it!!!!!
Choreography on point
I guess you could say that they didn't leave the door open for any flaws. This was great!
that high note is flawless Bruno is the best 😩😭❤️
🎤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🎤
I 💜this song 🎵 yes leave the door 🚪open for me baby
This is absolutely insane for a live performance.
Perfect.
I love this song💞💞💞
This was beautiful. I love it.
this is actually going to end up being legendary. Bruno Mars is definitely the Michael Jackson of our generation for sure.
They just took me back to the 70, 80 and 90 flying in love notes 😍😍😍!!
STOP SLEEPING ON ANDERSON
So like are tickets on sale? I’m gonna buy some panties to throw on stage.
Best performance of the night. This retro vibe is so damn FRESH. Bravo guys!
This song is pure perfection
Silk Sonic is THE definition of SMOOTH
How can anyone not like bruno mars?
Bruno i hate you for this obsession you’ve conjured up inside me
Stunning. I simply love it. I was in a daze watching this!💕💕💕
Anderson deserves a lot of recognition. He’s crazy talented. Didn’t know who he was before this song but I’m glad I know now!
Simplemente hermoso...
Maybe this will show the record industry there is a desire for some realness in music and not this ultimate trash thats coming out now.
This just gives me the chilles! Dam that Bruno!♡
Well, throw it on back, then, y'all! LOL
Bruno Mars took the BeeGee’s song “Emotions “ and changed it up in the beginning , And ended it with Ralphi Pagan “ To say I love you” @ the End.. crazy
I’m going to need y’all to get your vaccinations ASAP once they’re available so I can see this live. Thx😁
This some dope ass 1970s ass shit
Omg! Just love it! 🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️
Man why am I sitting here with goosebumps this here is that 🔥🔥🔥🔥
GET YOUR "I WAS HERE BEFORE 1M TICKETS" HERE
And this people is how it should be done ✅
LOVE IT NICE MIX!!!!!
Who ever gave this video/song a thumbs down ain't shit!!!
that was amazing
This actually changed my mind on old school duet harmonies. This is done extremely well.

A masterpiece performance
Switching leads reminiscent of David Ruffin and Eddie Kendricks! Bruno Mars & Anderson .Paak are keeping their spirits alive!
I can’t get enough of these two.
They sound EXACTLY like the recording. How??!!! I LOVE the changes they did to it to make it more fun. This song is instantly a freaking classic. We need a Live version on Spotify please

Chills, chills, chills 😍
We’ve been waiting for new music!! 😆😁
FLAWLESS 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩😍😍😍😍😌😌😌😌
Perfection of an old school love song that's made relevant for today. 🔥💖🔥💖🔥💖🔥This was much needed for the world to see. The outfits were right, the dance moves were on point, just smooth and feels good.  I keep replaying it😆🥰
I'm assuming the dislikes on this video were pushed accidentally.. 🧐
LOVE LOVE LOVE IT‼️ EVERYTHING I HOPED FOR ‼️🔥🔥🔥 That ending was PHENOMENAL‼️‼️‼️
Okay that first shot got me mad confused. I thought Trevor was The Weeknd. Got me in my room “why is The Weeknd speaking in a British accent?!?!”
Hear me out.... a collaboration album between Bruno and Anderson. 🥴
THIS IS BETTER THAN STUDIO! FUCKING INSANE!!....but i keep thinking, where is the awesome Philip Lawrence? anyone knows?
Bruno you the Man...but the grammys suck bruh....
This song pulls some many strings in my heart. Great combo. I LOVE IT.🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
Megan was ROBBED for Record of The Year!     😤😤😤
I’m glad this song is topping the charts right now. Great music isn’t dead.
This was the ONLY talent I witnessed on stage tonight. Last Grammy 4 me. 4 ever...
AMAZING I WANNA CRY😭😭😭😭😭
this duo is going to shake the world
Smooth as hell yesssss
For some reason I got a serious Temptations vibe from watching this. Anyone else???
Just wow 🤩 I love it old school style wow wow
The Jackson 4
Remix this song with OutKast would be 🔥🔥🔥
😍😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🗣Leave The Door Open..Best performance of the night! Flawless!! Yes Lawd!!
Omg they sound so cute 🥰 i am in love with the music I can’t wait till I am 20 I get to do stuff that I want to do 🥰

These two men were made for each other.
Y'all killed it! dangggg chill my boi!
People dislike this masterpiece?
Just wow oh wow
Silk sonic is the vibe for '21
That was fantastic this collab album is about to go for that clean sweep 🧹💃🏾
I am obsessed.
I need this on 8 track.
THEY ARE BOTH SO TALENTED! Proud of Anderson for his first Grammy!
I’ve dreamed of this Collab for so long , now that we’re gonna get an album from them two..... omg.....ima be a dad💀
that was fantastic
Superb! Ridiculously good!
Bruno is one of the few artists who can sing live just as good if not better than on the recorded version. And quite obviously so is Anderson. I can’t wait to see Bruno in concert again! Covid has got to go 😭
How did they outshine the already perfect studio version? Holy cow, this is one of the best songs of the year.
Pretty rare to see artists sound better live than the recording now a days like actually perfection live so talented !
The 96 ppl who thumbed this down must like bland chicken and raisins in their potato salad.
Keep the music coming guys
You guys were amazing!!!  😍😍😍😍
I love the return of this ole school love sound💖✌🏿
YESSSSSS😫😫😫
I was so confused I rlly thought The Weekend was hosting the Grammys after getting ripped off💀
bruno bodied the endin
I don't think the audio was recorded at the same time as the video. (not live performed) Still great tho, the little subtle changes they made at the end were quite good! excellent choice of harmony within the different melodies.
These two wow music 🎶 is real with these guys
This performance was timeless. I felt like I was in a time machine.🕑and went back into time when R&B music was REAL. Blue Magic, The Stylistics, The Delfonics, The Temptations just to name a few. Felt nostalgic...
I downloaded a vpn right when the vid came out cause for some reason the video's blocked in Thailand lolll, but damnnnn, toooo too beautiful and too damn talented!
I'm Reacting to this! I can't help it..i have to!!!
I love it!!
WHATTT I NEVER KNEW THEY WERE GONNA PERFORM AT THE GRAMMYS IM SO GLAD THIS CAME ON MY RECOMMENDATION
Wtf ahhh... So good...!!!
The They killed it!!!
My heart 😍😫😫
That was so good it seemed unreal.
New old school ...love it .
Imagine Trevor Noah, Bruno, and The Weeknd next to each other 😂
💯💯
Music that feels good and doesn’t call women out their name, or defile them...more please!
my depression is cured. my anxiety is gone. my skin is clear. my gpa is a 4.0.
My reason watching the Grammy, Bruno n Paak..worth the wait, just Beautiful when they were finished so was I..
I’m so glad Bruno is back 😭❤️
Perfection❤️
Reminds me of Jackson 5  I want to be where you are ! One of my favorite songs !!! Love this Bruno is flawless 😍😍👏🏽👏🏽
now this is the definition of perfect u can’t change my mind omg
Inject this shit into my veins.
What a beautiful performance
AP...Heavenly🎶🎼🎙
Those 96 dislikes are haters.
Love the influence of different artists. Also getting a bee gees vibe. Love it!
BEST performance at the Grammys in a minute!!🙌🏽😍😍🤩
is the tall guy in the back a member from the 'Hooligans'?  I hope that group isn't a thing of the past...  what about the 'Smeezingtons'?
Great song and even greater performance.
70's R&B Vibe....congratulations gentlemen.
BEST PERFORMANCE OF THE NIGHT!!!!...💯
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😘🥰😍😍🥰😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰 open
Love bruno mars
What is there not to like people? You can’t help but just vibe to this.
Whoever is 87 ppl and clicked Thumbs down Need to Shoot themselves in there Pinky Toes and never listen to music again PERIOD. This was 🔥🔥🔥
Gaah damn this way better than the recording man i love this so much.... and im such a bad person for not knowing Anderson Paak,  ut im telling imma go back and listen all of his songs man such a Beautifullyand Scary Combo ❤️🥰🥰🥺
Just when you thought they don't make music like this anymore, Bruno: Hold my Mimosa... Local boy making us all proud!
The vocals are ON POINT like the way bands used to back in the 70s and 80s. The way Bruno says 'open' 🥵 borderline orgasmic
So, so, so, so glad to have Bruno back! I don't know if most people know how privileged and lucky we are to be able to exist in a time where people with real talent still exist! What a legend.
Wow!
This is the only song that actual sounds like the recording. When other artist sing it sounds like they’re on crack.
Amazing Performance by Bruno Mars, first time in the Grammys since 2018 when he and Cardi B did “Finesse”
The Jacksons vibes
Congratulations I love song
The world: it's 2021  Silk Sonic: nah...1975.
This song is already crazy and it got even better live!
Don't hurt em....they killed it!
We needed this!!!! Thank you!!! Can’t wait for the tour and full album
So good! Like the  Delfonics, back in the  day. Wish they would sing record Baby The Wedding Song by Michael Bell.
This duo will go down in history
This thing was hella good wow. I want to believe this isn’t lip synced, am I correct?
Anything bruno mars touches turn into gold 🔥💯
Yasssss let’s go lalalala I got it see ya baby  yeahhhhhhhhhhh I’m going to leave the door open
This song reminds me of The Temptations - Get Ready but this is the slower version
Omg absolutely amazing 💕
Yessssss 🔥 best performance of the night no comparison
THE GLASSES <3
This entire performance... speechless!
I told my husband I'm leaving my door open tonight. He said what door?  I said read between the lines. 😭
amazing!
This is RnB yea baby. The the sound of Philly. TSOP. Reminds me of the older groups like The Spinners.
I would like say REAL MUSIC IS BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Bruno Mars is the genetically enhanced clone of Sammy Davis Jr.
I hope this trend catches on so we can get some real pop music again.
Bruno Mars is literally the greatest backup-vocals-writer of all time.
Everything Bruno does is absolute perfection! I don't think there is EVER a boring and bland performance from Bruno! And congrats to Paak on the win! Paak and Bruno are SO DAMN BRILLIANT! Can't wait for more!  Also proud Asians, but most importantly proud people in general! Everything is so beautiful
it's crazy that silk sonic invented life.
One of my favorite performances, hands down.
Honestly there aren’t a ton of songs being released right now that show case the type of VOCAL power seen here, these guys are so crazy talented.   2021 is going to be their year, and I wouldn’t be surprised if they initiate a culture shift in music
Omg this take me back to four tops, The Temptations, the five heartbeats...oh I love it!!!💕💕💕
I literally shouted in glee at that harmony at the end. Just pure talent❤️
Any collab with Anderson.Paak is a win.
👏👏👏😍🍷 Awesome🎶 Now that is how you bring Sexy Back🎤
Oh my....
70 style with a 2021 twist 🔥🔥🔥
These vocals are insane
OMG!!!! That was fantastic!!!! I can’t wait to hear the rest of this album!! This duo 🔥💥🔥💥
I love his music and his style is amazing, he's an old soul❤❤❤
I should really stop underestimating Bruno's performances. Anderson and Bruno really fucking knocked it out of the park with this one. It's even better than the recording which is damn rare in performers
The ONLY thing that was good about the Grammy's this year
OKAYYYYY I FEEL IT THROWBACK STYLE
Thank you for an amazing performance! Y’all are too smooth to handle! Can’t wait for the album because it will be straight 🔥🔥🔥
Bruno🥰🥰
Killer performance, they keep it 70s theme and those flawless dance movies; I absolutely loved it.
absolutely perfect
Bruno Mars’ evolution as an artist is just incredible
FAVORITE GRAMMY PERFORMANCE OF ALL TIME
Now this is how you preform 😌💅✨
Didn’t think this song could get any better... how dare I underestimate this overkill duo
Absolute fire!! ❤🤗
Magic. Simply sexy magic.
I swear I feel like I am watching 70s American bandstand
What a beautiful voice from Bruno
This is the incarnation of musical excellence 🔥
only reason to watch the grammy’s 👆
don't mind me, i've just been playing 3:37 on loop for the past 20 minutes
Yass best performance of the night

Dang Bruno and Anderson go together like peanut butter and jelly. This performance, the outfit, the vibes, I can't even put into words how much I love this song.
That was incredible
Perfection🤩 💘
how does one sounds like this WOW
This has to be the best performance Grammys performance tonight
Taking it back to the old school. The Boyz 2 Men, Temptations influence is apparent and appreciated.
Dang near had a stroke! All them flickering lights lol but good performance my boys
This is fucking amazing— the outfits and little choreography!!!
The only performance that matters!!!
Damn they takeing all are girl's
they violently mogged every other performance tonight
Im so glad that old R and B sound is Returning.Legendary Classical Music
I didn’t know if this was live or the video. It was that good
This was a Soul Stealing performance 😩 I was hypnotized throughout the entire performance and shed a tear when they broke it down🥲🥲🥲 I'm speechless otherwise ❤️
So... pretty sure the hubby and I just made our 3rd baby to this track 😘😘💕💕💕
HES TOO FKN GOOD!!!!!
ABSOLUTE TALENT
Lip sync

Bravo 👏🏾 bravo 👏🏾 bravo!!!!
Anderson couldn't u have worn a different hat more suitable to the outfit thats why bruno need to do ur own thang bro but shout out from us old heads and tell paak to change that dam hat next time
Song: Gorgeous Ending  Me: :)  AP: WooWooWooWooWoo
Epic throwback performance! The Academy should have begged them to do this.
The number of likes this comment gets is the amount of grammies Bruno deserves!
Not even on any prisoner of the moment shit but this is one of the best live performances I've ever seen
Bruno disappears for a while and when he comes back we all know it's going to be amazing omg this live version is so much better than the studio 😍😩
Amazing performance!  You all totally channeled the 70s.  This album is going to be amazing!!
Finally, they found a use for Trevor Noah, cause comedy sure ain’t it.
YES A LIVE
Man I remember when Anderson Paak was still Breezy Lovejoy. Love seeing him blow up like this and more people recognizing and enjoying his talent!
If the original was perfection, this is beyond perfection!
3:21 are you fucking KIDDING ME
I knew this song was a hit the first time I heard it...just like the first time I heard Ella Mai's Boo'd Up.
The performance of the night!
Grammy Covid Edition? Weak sauce. Silk Sonic Covid Edition? Saucy Strong Sauce.
They killed it! I wasn’t going to watch the Grammys unless they were on it!!
Perfect 🤩
AMAZING!!!! Live performances never disappoint
Thank you for bringing back the 70's
Leave the door open?!.... Baby, I already have the key 🔑!
Saving music, saving lives!!!
This performance had no right being soooo smooth 🔥🔥🔥🔥
this song is incredible
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Best Performance on the Grammy's... Paying Homage to The Delfonics and The Stylistics from the 1970's..
Good job, Bruno !
If The Jackson 5, The Temptations, and Earth Wind & Fire had a baby, it would be this
Pretty Pls release this LIVE Version on ALL Streaming Apps 🙏🏼🙌🏻❤️
This is the highlight of the Grammys
YESSSSS BRUNOOOOOO SING ITTT
YOOOO STOPPP!!!! Already have the winner for Song of the Year for next Grammys
Fuck the scammys except for this! They deserve more Grammys for this than Beyoncé deserves for her entire career.
wow. wow. wow. bruno really does channel the late great MJ with his desire for perfection and endless catalogue of timeless pop hits. props.
Already love the song .. But This Shit Live !!!!! Ommmgggggggg 👀😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️❤️
WOW! That was unbelievably good. What a song! What a collaboration! Soooooo talented! 👏🏾
wow.
Damn I'm getting motown vibes. The outfits. The filter.
Oooo that was so clean! 🤩
I can’t stop replaying the first verse. Anderson is so flawless with his notes!
Wow...
My baby's back 😍🥰😍 Real, talented, music and vocals
My door has been open ever since this dropped
This was great 😊
Ugh so perfect bravo 🙌
Love you guys!
3:20 was just absolutely pure talent. Bruno is just INCREDIBLE
Love how all his live performances are soooo much better than the studio versions. The amount of work he puts into his music is undeniably immaculate. He always finds a way to break down songs at the end and make it infinity times better 😍😍😍😍 no other artist like that. Silk sonic already going down in history.
If I was gay... boi let me tell ya lol jk
I’m getting “September” vibes from this 🔥👌🏽
Who doesn't like this??? Who dislikes this??? Why???
Bruno in the back: me casually waiting to take a shower 1:36
ONNNNNNNNN MERRDRRREEEEEEEEEE
Can’t imagine how great this album will be
I love how I feel like I’m back in the 70s. The music the performance. Just amazing
JSJSVSJSJDNSUDNSIDJF WYOIO. WTF HEISBD THIS IS THE BEST GRANMY PERFORMACE UN GHE WORLD
THIS is what we need more of! Talented artists joining forces to create LONG LASTING music rather than a viral hit on a social media platform that will fizzle out in a week or two.
J HI OLY SHIT
It was the choreography and set for me ! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Woo wuwu woo woo woooo 😙
The highlight of The Grammys!
This album is going to be so darn amazing. I'm patiently waiting.
They transformed us back to the 70's in 2021!!!!! Now that's what we needed.
Soooo amazing!
Beautiful!🧡🧡🧡🧡💛💛💛💛
HIS HEART GLASSES I WANT THEM AND I LOFE 5IS SOMG
Who else play this song over and over again? Meeee❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Cardi B or Justin Bieber would have made this song better !! 👍🏽✨
OMG...I didn't think I could fall in love with this man(Mars), this group more than before.  Im just hearing this song for the 1st time and know all the lyrics. I'm over 50yrs old and Bruno Mars was the 1st CD/album I've ever purchased.  This song is HOTTTTT! Anderson Paak and Bruno Mars In Silk Sonic is what we've been missing. That feel good music that will last the test of times.  Mars had to literally ask the Grammys to perform,, are you kidding me. The Grammys better NOT let another year pass without him/them performing. Welcome to entering the level of Marvin Gaye, Al Green,  Teddy Pendergast,  etc..
Best of the night☆☆☆☆☆.grammy
Their concerts smh.....fucking crazy to think about
Let me tell you this right here ....... this right here saved the Grammys
....and here come the pandemic babies!
Refreshing to hear actual musicians
Oh my god 😂😂😂 these boys are like peanut butter & jelly. Dear god! They should’ve been together from the start
They got the 70s look perfect
This was perfection!! Exactly what I hoped it would be & more 🙌🏼💕
Thats funny how they had a off brand bruno mars before the name brand bruno mars
Where can I find this on an eight track cassette?!🥰
This is the ultimate nice guy bread crumb ass song Who is Bruno dating
Who else want those heart glasses??? Meeee!!!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
This song gives such 70s vibes I’m in love
The level of talent between these two (and even the back-up singing) is just stupid good
PHENOMENAL!!!!!
It real isnt fair that you two made us wait for this long to get a collab from yall
I miss Class, glad it's in session 👑
Wow I love this it reminds me of oldschool love songs and groups. I remember when you could call the radio station and dedicate a song to the one you loved. This type of music had a meaning and you could play a song to express how you truly felt about someone. This song makes you want to fall in love again.
Dope how they both took turns doing background for each other
Amazing 👏
They're truly amazing!!!
Is this from the 1974 Grammy?
My ears have been blessed 👏👏
Bell bottom pants , wide collar shirts back and selling out after this epic performance... leave the door open pls
Damnit, y'all just got my ears pregnant. Do they even make Plan B for ears? How the hell am I supposed to deal with this
I’m gonna need to make a playlist with just songs like this
Claim your tickets here before viral 🎫
70'S vibe! Legit. Bruno is the best performer and musician of his generation. Modern day Michael Jackson! Just as talented and gifted. Keep it coming brotha!
Man I wanted to see the This on the Grammy so bad 😢😁😍🎉
Favorite song this year😁🔥
THE HARMONIES, THE OUTFITS, THE TWO SCREENS IM SO WET
I am in love.. old souls
LEGENDARY
Alright now, I hear y'all. Beautiful done, Congra
Such a masterful performance. I am in absolute awe of them and their performance. So Soulful, so Bruno ❤️❤️❤️❤️. Silk Sonic your amazing!!!!
I just want Anderson to say  " f#@! your couch   Eddie murphy"!
The ending live vs studio recording is honestly way better, nonetheless both amazing.
The golden child of pop is back Bruno Mars 💪🏾🔥🔥
YESSS BABY 😍😍 this my new shit
Loved every second!🥰
*paak and bruno = pbj or mj and pippen! great duo! Too much funk!*
The performance was great.. I just needed the suits to be a smidge tighter..
i will be repeating 1:43 all week, thank you, goodnight.
Bruno Mars never fails to impress. Chef’s kiss MUAH
The only performance I enjoyed tonight... along with the Jacob Collier noms. A song. A real song. With real singing.
this album is gonna be a classic🥺🥺💫💫💫💫💫
yo anderson's drums in the little richard trib was nuts
Everyone’s talking about the singing but can we talk about the showmanship.  Smooth and precise by all the fellas.  Proud to play this in my car with my teenage sons listening.  Good music and real vocals wins every time.
This live performance sounds like a studio recording and i love it
The fact that they took it back to Motown 70s is so out of sight right now!!! I can visualize Don Cornelius introducing them up on stage. This is truly a Soul Train performance and if this was back in time they would fit in perfect with the Jackson 5 and The Sylvers era. You have two of the best artists of this time to collab together and create a timeless classic hit album for the young and the old to vibe to in the middle of this craziness we living in. And I can honestly say this just based off this song alone. It just really good music and it's their real voices that touches the soul. No lip singing just straight authenticity all the way through. Thank you Paak and Mars, for blessing the world's ears!!! You just made history together!!! 😊💖👌👍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Different!! Wow
Kameron😍😍😍😍
Goddamn 🔥
Addicted to this song!!! Come on 1:41 ..... ANDYYYYYYYY :)
Oh my god what am I witnessing? One of the greatest masterpieces of all times
💚Bruno the Soulful👑💕🙌😎
They tore it up and easily the best performance of the night and truth,they could have given the whole evening to performance Imo
Having Anderson.Paak or the Free Nationals on your song is a fucking cheat code.  And Bruno Mars doesn't even NEED a cheat code. That's how ridiculously good this project is gonna be...
70's!!!!!!!!!!!!
Now that was classic
Dang!!!! That was AWESOME!! No other words to describe the beautiful sound from the talented gentlemen. ❤😁
I'm going to be honest. I wasn't going to watch the Grammy's at all. When I heard Bruno and Anderson was going to perform.... I made sure I watched, just for them!!!! I screamed so loud!!! I love this song so much!!! The performance was just perfection. The old school feel of this song is so beautiful!!! I can't wait to see them in concert. I can't wait for the album... I am so ready!!!!!!!! Love both of these two powerhouses!!!!
This should be illegal
there happened to be a Grammy ceremony and Bruno and Paak's concert
Bruno’s voice is incredible. Literal singing goals
You know how good you gotta be to be inactive for 4 YEARS come back with 1 song and LITERALLY 2 weeks later be performing it at the Grammys?!!???!! That’s Bruno Mars for you
Ahh yes. More baby making music I could add to my playlist. Thank you Bruno 💙
BEST PERFORMANCE OF THE NIGHT 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Don't they remind you of the 70s group LIKE the stylistic or Blue magic or The whispers wow Bruno 🤣
i didn’t know it was possible to love this song any more but-
Perfect Collab I love, love, love the 70's vibe this song has. Just beautiful. Great Job Fine ass Bruno and Anderson 😊💯💯‼💖💖💖
Wow what a song
0:55 , 2:00 , 3:01 I think it’s safe to say that this has been on repeat for everyone since the release👏🏼🎶
these will be the artists our generation will talk to our children about
Tbh this was even better than the studio version
Nah this is too damn good ,  anderson paak vocals Silkyyy smoooth
In the words of Prince, "Real musicians making real music!". Dem Boyz took me back for real!!!
extraodinary and superb performances , from the true  musicians ❤️
same tempo at the beginning as 'that's what i like' not very ground breaking imo
As if the recording wasn't dope enough and then they top it with this! Crazy. Go fellas!
They gotta old school r&b sound going on. The sound fabulous!! 👍🏾💖💖
That ending is nice... is that going to be on the album version? You guys are so retro, but yet the sound is at a new level.  Can't wait to hear the rest of the album.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I love them SO much! I cant wait until the tour. But I need to know...how much coke went into this project lol
here before this blows UP
I refused to watch the grammys, I told myself I'll wait until a video of Bruno and Anderson. Paak pop ups thats the only performance I know would be worth it! So not disappointed. They knocked it out of the park, and showed everyone how real artistry, performance and singing is done! So flawless and beautiful 😍
SILK ICONIC!!!
I never heard of those people but not disappointed   Besides Bruno
The greatest artist in our generation! I’m gonna work hard and I wanna collab with them!
Best Performance ever. Bruno and Anderson killed it🔥🔥🔥🔥
damn...
WOW
Killed it ✨✨
Just Speechless 🎶🎶🎶❤️❤️❤️The Song Speaks for Itself 😁😁😁
Wow Bruno Mars first time lip syncing at the Grammys. I love this song now but thoes horrible boo boo 💩 outfits just horrible.
OMG!!!! I got CHILLLS from this performance!!! I need Bruno Mars to go on TOUR ASAP!
Already ready for this tour to pop off! 💯🔥🔥🔥🔥
YAY! They got on!! 😁👏🏾😁👏🏾😁👏🏾
Amazing amazing Amazing amazing amazing Amazing amazing amazing Amazing amazing amazing Amazing
everyone should be thrown. in prison. for not knowing about Anderson .Paak
This is just perfection in motion ❤
How are they literally perfect
Damn Bruno Mars killed that damn Bruno 👊
It's a cheat code to be this good live 🔥🔥🔥
the king is back!!!
What a great combination...Bruno and Anderson ❤
Flawless...............and silky!!!!
Amazing Bruno Mars and Anderson Paak just pushed to another level. The album is going to blow up with multi-platinum sales.
<<Liked  subbed  all I can saw is W-O-W
Yaaaaassss 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
JAMZZZZZZZ
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Amazing as usual! Loved it! Thank you!
They fricken killed that joint
Wowwww, if only Bruno could mentor me and teach me to sing just as well. Man has the voice of an angel 🥺🙏🏽😭
Maaaan listen, me & my lady heard this song last week on the radio.  👁️ immediately Shazamed it 2 find it made sense why it had the ol' school Quiet Storm vibe.     *Bruno Mars is a TRU student of REAL Soul and R&B, and it's good 2 have him back.  A LOT of these young entertainers today lack just that, ENTERTAINMENT.  And talent*  *Edit* PS: This was an excellent collaboration!
I hope their album is as great as this track!
These Kings killed it!!! Silk Sonic is gonna drop a 🔥🔥🔥 album!!
J.J. Evans: "Well, Hello Everyone Out There In TV Land" "Dynomite" 🕺#1970s
AHHHH!!!  ALL OF THIS IS PERFECTION ❤️😍😍😍😍😍

Love it, this is great it reminds me of old school Rhythm and Blues!!
2021 is officially theirs.
YEEESSSSS SIR!!!!❤😍😘
Wtf it sounds exactly the same as the official audio lmao
Breezy Lovejoy!!!!! So happy for Anderson man. Fucking KILLING IT.
Release this live version on Apple music before I allegedly illegally download it 👀
They legit need to start a quartet IMMEDIATELY!! 🙌🏽💯🙏🏽

Just when you thought nothing is perfect in this world. 😍
FUUUUUUUUCKIN GET IT  ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL
Great performance and sound mixing .
I didn't know Dave Chappele can sing. LOL
They are killer.  Music needs this right now!!  Really!!!
I've watched this more times than I should
omg that’s all i got to say
Just. Love. This. Couldn't imagine it better than the "studio version" (initially released version) already...then this ❤
Ok, I saw @SilkSonic gave a classic old school R&B/ SoulTrain performance @2021 Grammys with a hint of 1974 Blue Magic. Bruno & Anderson's bringing music back that you can actually sing along with. Well done! 👏👏👏👏 Yes, I'm old enough to remember 😉❤
Amo tanto este hombre  que a mi bebé  le puse bruno ❤❤🥰🥰😘
Absolutely Fabulous
Damn this s*** perform like the seventies damn Bruno Mars 😝
It's the double spin for me 0:55
only been a week but i already memorized all the lyrics
This performance should be taken to Soul Train Awards 🤩
I remember this sound and look back in this day!!! Sounds just as good now as it did then!!! Excellent job fellas!!!
They were in cruise control too that's the coldest part. Can't wait for the album!
Love it, only watched for this, amazing performance!! ❤❤
As I expected yall killed that shit!!! 🙌🔥🙌🔥🙌🔥🙌
I love this.
Oh yes......whomever disliked this...u must dance to the rhythm of guitar and not the beat of the drums...which means u have no Soul in u
TRULY IN-CRED-I-BLE!!!!
Phenomenal performance. I loved every bit of it. Please don't break up. You guys have so much in store for yourselves. Much love 💘
😍😍😍😍😍
This is magic 🪄 ✨
This is the video I didn’t need, but am very glad now exists.
one word: talent
Sounds exactly like audio! 💕 killed it!
Very good performance bruno
you sound just like the song that’s talent right there , such a smooth and luxurious feeling this song gives✨❤️
The minute I heard this song rather the first beats , I was in and all in.  Yes, we need more of this kind of music. I miss it.  Leave the door open and keep this music going.  A hit for sure. Young people this is music that will last the test of time.
Yo this song was the best
the outfits need more attention cause shoooo YALL LOOK GOOD! and I love how the sparkle star light in the background matched to the beats. And Bruno never never needs auto tune,them high notes- j uhh😩 y’all are so talented
This shit is legendary. The whole Set , the whole vibe , the whole energy . . Great performance. Shout out to the other two brothas too

as a musician, wow
everything about this is PEREFCT
The best I’ve heard 🥰👏🏼 during quarantine. Smooth, an ol’ school vibe to it awww just perfect! Makes me feel happy 💯 Thanks Bruno & Anderson for sharing 🤩
This is how’s ,music is supposed to be installed of Wap   . this was super sexy & clean . It’s just made you feel good .
Maaaan when Anderson just focuses on singing the vocals are on another level
Absolutely amazing and sexy
perfection!!!!!! too excited for the album cant wait. only reason i watched the grammys
Soo good! Just want we needed! 😍
It’s the old school film quality and the hazy stars in the background for me 🌟
Bruno Mars is in the same category as Freddie Mercury, Michael Jackson, and Beyoncé. Some of the BEST ALL AROUND PERFORMERS OF ALL TIME!
"Woooooo woo woo wooo wooo woouuu woouu wou woo woo wouu wooooooo" 😍😍😍
Yes, yes, yes!!!!
best thing to happen in 2021
So glad I saw this on the Grammys. I must admit, even though I heard the name Anderson Paak before, I never knew about his talents prior. I’m now a fan of Anderson Paak and Bruno Mars.
This tour and album gonna make me act up
Saw this on the Grammys and my oh my......
This entire performance and song is a VIBE
My heart just fully melted 🥺🥺🥺
Are they leaving the door open 3 inches or nah?
You guys just now hearing about Anderson .Paak just wait... this gonna be AOTY calling it now
I expected nothing less than this perfection.
@Bruno Mars, great performance as always.  You're voice sounds amazing..wow!⚡💃💞💃🎉
Brunito🥰
Just made love as this song played for the first time ever! Came in 3.2 seconds ! Best night of my life easily! My new favorite song ❤️
I jus want to live here for awhile...my heart really misses this ❤
🔥🔥🔥🔥
STOP KEEPING SECRETS!!! I was very pissed that they didn’t let y’all in
JESUS CHIRST THIS IS SO FUCKING GOOOD!!!!! SO SMOOOOOOOOOTH
Bruno is giving me David Ruffin, sir. The whole performance gave me Temptations aesthetic and vibes. I loved it💛!!! Bruno and The Temptations my favorite artist combo/clash had me sweating. And Anderson Paak, bruh, dude was bomb fr💣. I love the raspiness in his voice. They were sangin' like the rent was due.
I feel like this is meant to be watch in low quality
Love me some Bruno. Sorry to say I hadn't heard of Anderson Paak, but now I love him.  They are dynamite together.  This song is simply beautiful...great collaboration 👋🏿👋🏿👋🏿
Anderson is good, but maaan. That boy Bruno Mars, his singing vocals is on a WHOLE nother level. Brilliant performance by Silk Sonic!
Just amazing. No words to describe how I feel rn
wow they really don’t need autotune.
WOW
Masterful 👏🏾
How dare we  get something that's actually good. That s*** made me cry man. I believe that we have realized the new Dynamic and maybe it can restart the Motown movement
Absolutely loved this performance!!!!  The Old school just hit different! Awesome! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾❤️❤️❤️
I got pregnant listening to this performance!  🤣
Bruno is great, but the prize is understanding that he is pointing you to the past.   He's so good at it, so I can't even be mad at him. But do go back and explore the bands from which he is taking inspiration.
Loving the song strong 70s vibe Bruno and Anderson such great vocals don't sleep on this one certified hit ✌️
I love you bruno mars❤️🇵🇭❤️
Bruno doesnt miss u cant lie
Giving me all types of feels and vibes 😍🥰🥰
Early?
anybody know if Phillip Lawrence is still gonna be working with Bruno?
Sooo freaking talented. Wow! 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
😉
This is the song of the year so far for me, but Cee Lo Green and Stokely Williams could have been those other two dudes with no names.....IJS.... on second thought, they’re perfect just the way it is...🤩🤩🤩
Talent.
Oh my God I'm so mad that I don't get to see people's reaction to this performance.
why is this not available in the Philippines…im using VPN RN
Well it’s something, been waiting for a song 😭
insanityyyyy
THIS IS THE GREATEST THING EVER. Those notes, those dramatic moves, the outfits, forever want them paired.
Grammys seemed so raunchy  until Anderson.Paak and Bruno Mars. This was bad ass and refreshing!!! Loved it!!❤️
Omggggggggggg this was flawless. Bravo gentlemen
thats as good as it gets these days. nice work
They killed it
Damn I might fool around become somebody's daddy messing with this album
Deserved an award! Best performance.... best PERIOD. 🔥🔥
I love it💜💜💜
Bruno's Puerto Rican side is slowly taking over
OMG
ka imal!
Oh my! You guys look so good! Your performance was very sensual and electric. You remind me of entertainers from a past Era. OMG, we have missed this kind of music. This song helps bring everyone back to LOVE. Powerful! Blessings to you all. God and the angels say," thank you." And, I/we say, that we are grateful.🙏😇
I Love ❤️ The Song
Honestly this is better live... fucking incredible.
Wow amazing 😻
They drippy 🥵 fr fr and these main vocals and background vocals 🔥💯
cant wait for the album
this performance, the outfits, the dances, the vocals, just perfect
best performance !
Yo this is a dope performance it’s a mixture of The Temptations and The Four Tops😎👍🏽🔥🔥🔥🔥💯
They've released one single and it's already the Album of the Year.
BTS fans crying, while the real ones are enjoying this performance.
Ooo 70’s vibes with the fits yesss
Chills!!!!!
FLAWLESS!!!!
Reminds of summer in the mid 70's
They trying bring R&B back to life the r&b we got right is shit
I LOVE THIS SONG... it’s a true ode to the early 70’s Philly sound ... #STYLISTICS #BLUEMAGIC  ❤️❤️❤️
R&B Needs a stimulus  and Silk Sonic is the package.  Was like watching MJ on Motown25...This group is going through the stratosphere  and beyond.. Trevor was about to introduce something legend...like motown25 again....I'm not sure if they realize what a musical industry shift they are about to bring about...Its like they are from the past future..or future`s past .lol Silk Sonic is Legend already....no doubt...Hope these dudes stay close,, and stand the test of Time like JimmyJam and Terry Lewis...
Welp, I'm pregnant. Who else is pregnant with me?
This is truly a class
This is what music SHOULD sound like... Keep it up, Silk!!!
This performance reminds me of the Treasure video
I really cannot get on this band's wagon - honestly, it feels like a Saturday Night Live skit.  It's just toooo derivative, it's almost uncomfortable.  I find it insincere, inauthentic, and downright problematic honestly.  Plus song verges on funny too, not romantic or sexy - "I got that haze, I got fillets?"  - if you told me this was a parody, I would think it was genius.  Like if you told me this was a Mel Brooks scene, or Sexual Chocolate were making a comeback, then yes!
Pure Excellence 🔥🔥🔥
crazy talk
GOAT 🐐🔥
man idek how i am this early
That classic vibe and performance right so fly 💪🏾💯
YES!....LORD!........
Killed it!
We know who'll be getting the bulk of the next Grammys
Sicker dan da original🙏🤓😳😜👍
I’m ashamed I didn’t know about Anderson until this collab
0:16 you're welcome
How is it possible that this song live  is even more amazing than it already was!! 🤯🤯🤯🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Following Anderson on IG, knowing he was wasted makes this all the more impressive
Silk sonic so smoooooooth!!!! ❣️❣️❣️❣️
Bruno Mars is the best male singer of this time 🔥🔥🔥🔥
ANDIEEEE! IM in love.
that switch off was to clean
This is what real vocal talent sounds like.
FIREEE
Theses two come together as one, and now everything is right in the world. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
That’s how you do it..... 👏👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👏👏👏
How do you not like this song 🎵
He never fails to amaze me with his vocals, every time I think he can’t get any better he does
Y’all stole the mf show
I feel like I just arrived in heaven 🥰
this shit was too smooth for my own good
About to change the game....my two favorites PAAK and MARS... I already put money to the side for this concert
Take u back in time to Motown love
They KILT it.
this performance is so good. and I really missed Bruno he just gonna dip for like 2 years 😐 BUT YALL SOUND SO GOOD
The song and their voices are just angelic, nothing else to be said.
This is exactly the vibe this song needed.
I can't breathe! The choreography was so tight and a surge of memories flooded me. The Fly suits, oh mercy me! I loved that Anderson showed more of his vocal talent and that Bruno went further in his prowess, the harmonies, especially at the end with Bruno and Anderson!! Daaayaammn! Thanks boys, more please!
Performance was 🔥🔥. Never disappoints.
Yes! This. is. music.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🚨🚨🚨🚨
Absolute Perfection. A single tear just fell from my eye.
Amazing performance
Don’t sleep on Anderson .Paak!
I need a whole album! I can’t wait for this album. This was an amazing performance! Vocals man the vocals!
Wish paak was playing drums😪
This performance bro 🤯🤯🤯🤯👀
Ready for the album!
the 70s are coming back and im in love

Great way to end my work day :)
They’re coming for that album of the year...
Motown vibe all day I love this
Banger

Silk Sonic > The Weeknd
I need Anderson’s glasses.
love love love this smooth sexy, slow, jam. 💯👍💕💕💕
The grooviest performance of the night. Both held their own, and had so much soul. You could tell they really take time into perfecting everything they do. They’re so enchanting.
This is pure joy.
Shaved like a babys bottom
I would let Bruno Mars leave my door open
Bruno Mars is just so 😩😩😩😍😍
this was ridiculous 🤯
The only good performance
Feels like real music. They did that👏🏽
Welcome Back Old School! We missed ya!
OH PERIOD
How does this live performance turn it up so hard? The original was immaculate.
CHIIIILLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
This is what the grammys needed. Real Music!!!! I said what I said. There was other artists that slayed as well. But I was really waiting for this. Thank you for making my night ❤️
Can't wait for the tour!
This was nice.  Wish usher woulda performed bad habit that’s my song!
Love it! Sangggg Bruno!!!!!! Nice collaboration! #silksonic
Magical 🤩✨
I feel like I don't deserve to see such a perfect stage. Bruno never fails to amaze me and I love Anderson's voice, they're magic together.
I love Andersen Paak,  I love Bruno.  YouTube plays this for me every other song..... And I'm still singing along!! "Smoove Like A New Born"🤣
Perfect’O
bruno hit that Eb5 so hard i almost fell outta my chair
Just pure gold! The oufits, scenery and the vocals 😭. Can not get this song out of my head!!
OMG OMG OMG OMG.
Nice!!!
SING BRUNO SING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Living for this old school video vibe! Never knew I needed this duo until now!
Silk Sonic some bad mother....

100% sure, they gonna win many awards next year!!
I’m literally so in love with yall
Yassss!!!  Real music!!  Yasss!!!
and just when you thought they coudln't outdo the studio version.... they prove us wrong again. I posted on the OG video posted that the live version would be better and I wasn't dissappointed.  really putting the screws on the bullshit tik tok trending songs that controlled the music industry for the last 10 months
I'm loving every minute of this promotion for this album straight fire
Bruno Mars Swagg is untouchable🔥🔥🔥.
This was PHENOMENAL but I feel selfish for asking for a studio recording of that Little Richard tribute
🚒
One word. AMAZING 👏👏👏👏
no because you guys SLAYED the Grammys and I am so ready for you guys to own this music company. PERFECTION. GODS. WOW.
AYY🎶🎶
This the best live performance I’ve seen in a while and you know why it sounds so good? Because the recorded with like the bare minimum on their voices. Just raw talent dude good stuff Bruno
Somehow Bruno’s voice got even better
Wow what a performance ! Too Smooth !
This performance shows that this duo is gonna be amazing on tour
F I R E💯 🔥🔥🔥
Bruno!!!🙌🏼👏🏼🙌🏼👏🏼
They killed it !👏🏿👏🏿
They can serenade me anytime, I'm in love.

I have no words 🤯
Who else thought it was Dave Chappelle?
POV: you cant take your eyes off of Bruno's lil rat stache l-l
🔥😎now that kids is a performance
Damn that was somehow even better than the studio version
I'm confused. There's no way this was live...there's literally not one mistake in the vocals
Where is Bruno's other side kick? 💘 This song is for all the Lovers!!!
bruno lookin thin
The amount of power Bruno puts into singing is crazy
Imagine Bruno Mars singing to yo girl and you instantly realizing that she’s no longer your girl... 🤷🏾🤦🏾 Amazing set by both of them
Te amo 😍
That was outstanding🙌
This performance was straight up dreamy 😎
POV: this is the only part of the grammys that you have seen so far lol
Performance of the decade so far
Buno Mars & Anderson Paak are so damn great together
Anyone else get MJ vibes?
They dont need autotune.
Ooooweeeeee 🥰🥰😍😍
Please give us this album already 😍🤣
I think I just stepped into the 70's and I'm loving it!!!
I knew i had struck gold when i first heard Bruno back in middle school. Now that i'm older i get the benefit of enjoying both the nostalgia AND the talent👏 thank you Bruno Mars much love<3
I think I just stepped into the 70's and I'm loving it!!!

If this is any indication of being the first released song off the Silk Sonic album....they will win numerous Grammys next year...and the tour will sell out quick!  These two were meant to collab,  real musicianship...real artistic vocalizations. I haven't heard such a perfect song in a long time....impeccable production   This song is a love letter to music.  Just pure perfection!  Don't let anyone say to you that music died a long time ago...todays music, with these two young bucks is alive and well.  Shout out to Bootsy!
The Temptations reborn
The
I love how they took turns leading and pulling back-up singer/dancer. Smoothest tagging ever 🔥👍. Beautiful, classy performance. ❤👏👏

Thank you Bruno Mars and Anderson Paak for letting modern music know that this is how music suppose to be like & not material things that people need to hear.No body should care about 💰, 🚗, 💊, 🥒 🍑, 🏘️ or going to the Strip clubs and that's Modern music is all about.If music was like back in the day from maybe the 60's to the 00's where there was story telling,wordplay & a message music would be better than it ever was before.Thank you Gentlemen for bringing the sound that we need to hear!
The Grammys aint even worthy. Sick performance, cant wait for the album!

Good to see Bruno hasn't lost his incredible moves
ANDERSON WITH THE VOCALS AND BRUNO WITH THE VOCALS AND SILK SONIC WITH THE BEAUTIFUL MUSIC
Sounds recorded asf!
When you already know all of the words. 😩
The ending with them singing together was dope! They mesh well as if they were meant to be a duet group!
Wish I like this a thousand times 🥰
I'm glad to say I was smiling throughout the whole performance 😃
the fact that he literally asked the grammys to let him perform through a notes app letter and it worked
Man oh man that ending is so moving. Bravo you guys 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏

The collab I didn't know that we needed! #SilkSonic
KING SHIT BEST PERFORMANCE OF THE NIGHT!!!!!!!! CAN’T WAIT FOR MORE🔥✨
Silk Sonic ladies and gentlemen.
They did that this performance SLAYS!!! 🔥🔥🔥😍😍😍
Great Song ... Bruno and silksonic did it again. Pure talent!!!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

And Anderson Paak won his fourth grammy tongiht
The effects, the Soul Train aesthetic. The smooth vocals, the harmony, their spins. Just makes me wanna cry
Fantastic R&B. So glad they were on the Grammy's and did this live.
Oh, and I am so in love with Bruno Mars....been listening to his songs all day.

I'm coming thru!!!
SEEING THIS MADE MY WHOLE NIGHT
Why does this give me jackson 5 vibes
Best performance. Tell me I'm wrong
Can we talk about 0:54?? That spin transition was Silk Sonic Smoooov!
2:33 to 2:39 is my favorite part.
Bruno copying the weeknd's hair, glasses, moustache, suit & most important, trying to recreate his voice 😭😭😭
Love this performance!
all the Bootsy Collins!
This album is going to be absolute 🔥🔥🔥
Anderson really said "my mic is on"
100 percent!!! A+
I only watched the Grammys to hear them live and boy was it worth it
Damn this was such a vibe, my family loves this song and I don’t blame them😩👏🏼
This Performance WAS THE GRAMMYS! ...The only reason I watched...
Bruno is the only singer I've ever heard that sounds as good live then in the video
I can see DC Young Fly jamming in the trap with his old daddy trench on to this
Very original ......
I just wanna know what rehersals were like cause i feel like they were laughing so much
*rookie vocalists have left the chat*
Weeknd can't hit high notes live BRUNO MARS CAN
Hopefully this brings out more of the 80s culture back
I was just cooking dinner to this jam
Is that Kameron singing backup??
C'mon, This was The Best performance IN GRAMMY'S 2021!

This song just hit #1 , the vocals on these guys , was perfect , Bruno was worth waiting for.
This album is going be amazing
Those 35 that hit the dislike button don't know "real" music. The vibes they giving with  this song is where music originated from before little one hit wonder rappers came along.

Yall quit playing and drop the album already, the world needs these vibes👀
The best performance from the Grammys 🔥🖤❤️

This AMAZING performance just made me anticipate the album even more! So glad Paak is getting his time to shine fr FINALLY! I've had this song in HEAVY rotation since it was released. Omg album me PLEASE ASAP 🔥
This was SO DOPE. The vocals at the end, and the videography giving a nod to the '60s/'70s 🔥Iconic.
I love the astigmatism lights
This performance is absolutely genius!
love the song. love these artists. hate the fact that Bruno Mars is subconscious of his short height. get over it booboo....you's hot. Also, Anderson .Paak, what's good!
Love love 💕    Feel good music we need this ...  💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥!!!
Sexy
Spectacular!!
10/10 performance
Absolutely loved this.  That song is beyond 🔥.  Takes you to that special place when you hear vocals and music that is truly music.  Not what’s being passed off as music nowadays.  True artists (Silk Sonic) took the stage tonight with a breathtaking performance of Leave The Door Open.
Bruno so damn fine 😍😍😍😍

This performance was the whole 9 yards

Bruno Mars had the best male voice of our generation
Omgg, I love this song it has that old skool sound to it.
I never clicked so fast just amazing just fuckin amazing
Ngl the costumes remind me of the music video treasure
Mr Don Cornelius would’ve had them fools on the Soul Train stage just sangin
This is what I need in my life, let's bring male musical groups back!!! 💙💙💙💙
YASSSS **snaps fingers multiple times**
Love you Bruno.💕💕
Only reason why anyone watch the Grammys tonight. Let Silk Sonic thrive

I can't be the only one feeling like we're gonna be hearing this song for longggggg time
WELCOME BACK...DAMNMMM 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💞💞💞💞
THE WORLD MISSED YOU KING WELCOME BACK
I love the way they switch who's on lead and who's with the back up smoothly. It's simple, but clean
Bootiful just Bootiful 💕
this performance gave me LIIIIIIIFE.
It's great to watch the 1973 Grammy Awards! Thanks! :D
ARE YOU F’IN KIDDING ME? live version *almost* better than studio, choreography ON. POINT.... outfits just right. you guys. I swear. this song. amaaaayyyyyyzzzzzing. CANNOTWAIT for album! lots of love and congrats on such a fantastic collab!!
I'm so lucky we have Bruno in the generation. Others had Elvis, MJ, etc. At least we have him ❤
Good lord Bruno 👍👍👍
I kept my hand up snapping the whole song... love this
We all know that where there is  bruno there is straight fire
One Word:  Extraordinary!!👏👏💯💯
😊Love it Bruno u got my favorite color so groovy u got me Vibin😌🧡
I AM SO GLAD BRUNO IS BACK
Bruno is a gift to us all, He makes you love music again. Silk Sonic I look forward to this!! I felt like I was watching Motown 25 again.
🔥🔥🔥 even better than the Studio Version
This was just beautiful I loved there voices together they sound so beautiful  I love bruno so much ❤️❤️❤️❤️💯💯
dude Bruno is actually so talented
Bruno always makes me feel some typa way ❤️❤️ I'm a new fan of anderson .paak ily too
People really be liking the video as fast as possible knowing the performance was already good
Yasssss lawwwwwd😮😍
Bruno is tight. Bringing back the music from before and hitting each note with depth of feeling ✔️✔️✔️✔️
Real music representative of the classics of the 70s ❤
They sound even better than the recording, especially Anderson.  Legitimate artists usually do.   Hate that I’m just hearing about Anderson Paak but at least I know now!  Great match up!
Possibly the best duo in the last two years. People have been sleeping on Paak for years now. Glad he's getting his recognition.
So smooth
Oh okay.
Bruno I’m forking in love
✨🎶’Real Vocal Abilities’-‘Real Talent’ !!!🎩🎵🏓
Such an amazing Performance!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👍🏽😉
This version is actually better than the studio version and I thought you couldn't get any better than that!
This performance was straight up epic and paid homage to the old school artist. Definitely did not disappoint.
As usual, nothing but an amazing, powerful, musically aesthetic and perfection all in one!!!! @brunomars it was worth waiting for you to come back!!! Here's to anticipation of the next single and @silkysonic of course too 🎙❤❤❤🥰🤗🌠🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
They killed that shit!
THAT SWITCH BETWEEN ANDERSON AND BRUNO WAS TOO CLEAN
I love how 70s this is! BRING IT BACK 🥰
Smooth
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
The only reason I even cared about the grammys
I'm in love with performance ❤❤
Just straight 🔥 but classy fire
Bruno Mars is amazing!
Very classy!!!
The amount of talent and style is ridiculous
I’m so glad Bruno came back
yes yes yesssss! 😭😭
This is the SEXIEST thing I’ve seen this year, last year, maybe since the 70s.  Thank you “Silk Sonic” much appreciated.
🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
🔥❤🔥❤
Love to see Anderson get his respect! Sings and plays the drums, he’s a legend in the making
The soundtrack of a 1970’s shaggin’ wagon van with a black light interior with this song plays on repeat...And it’s straight to Knockin’ Boots!!
The performance was phenomenal ❤🔥❤🔥❤🔥❤🔥❤🔥
My jam!
Love Bruno, but sounds like most of it was playback and some parts had live bits, but still amazing
The fits, the vocals, the dance moves, whewww chile I missed me some Bruno and now we have Silk Sonic 😭😭
I'm a big fan of the music of the 70s, as well as Bruno Mars. So the music in this speaks to me. But as ALSO an aficionado of 70s fashion, they coulda done MUCH better with the coloring on those suits.
Bruno😩🥵
POV: you clicked when you saw Bruno Mars

💃 en naples Florida
THIS IS MY JOINT...I SMOKE SMOKE THIS...🖤🖤🖤
If 0:55 isn’t the smoothest thing I’ve seen in my entire life...
So good to see these two and their band in the spotlight again. Here before 100,000 views.  💖 💖
Bruno Mars and Anderson SHUT THE SHOW DOWN with this performance. So talented! This homage to the groups of the late 70's is so forgotten we've truly forgotten what real music was like, with groups with live instruments and performance with just a microphone and their God given talents that seduced and mesmerized us. My parents reared me on old school and I'm so glad they did because I can truly appreciate this performance! 🥰💯🔥
Best song ever ❤️🥰😍
Hi to bruno mars
Fire 🔥! Yes Sir! Loving 🥰 it!
🔥😍🥺❤️🔥😍🥺❤️
Bruno mars!
they sound great live, just as good as if not better than the recording! that feels rare sometimes  :)

Te amo Bruno Mars 😻❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🔥
They killed this performance
Anderson.paak is needs more credit he is so good I mean don’t get me wrong Bruno slaps but Anderson.paak is extremely good
This is what the Grammys were created for.
bruno really came back and said lemme save save music real quick. can’t wait for this album. their voices together
Obsessed
I think it’s rude for CBS to call this live. This is a damn pre taped planned music video. 🥴. I wanted LIVE LIVE with a band. We already got a music video Bruno and team.
This man is soooo fineeee😩
this is so good!
I watched this live but I just want to say… that I was crying on the “LALALAS”
Fuckin amazing. Such talent.
