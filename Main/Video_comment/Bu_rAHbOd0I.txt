Okay, I admit, it’s kinda funny how Ed Sheeran, my mother’s favorite singer of all time, went from someone who’s all videos are songs, to someone who also adds ads like this lol 😂
*“Be honest who else is a few hours late”😂*
You are amazing
I love your music Ed Sheeran
Hi Ed, wishes you get well soon 🍀
I have never ever ever been so excited for an album to drop. It’s my first time actually having a countdown on my phone. I have a gut feeling this album will be very healing for me.  Thank you, Ed ♥️
He is so cool
Thinking about you Ed. It's a shame you had to get Covid the week your album drops. I hope you get to feeling better. Sending thoughts and prayers your way. Looking forward to Friday!! x ❤
