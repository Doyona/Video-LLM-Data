I nominate "The VelociPastor." It is a comedy-horror film about a priest who gains the ability to turn into a dinosaur and fights ninjas
Absolutely elated they took a look at Breen! They need to do more peeks at his work lol
2:43 gator never fly
React to Neverland: the mini series  vfx shots
You guys had me dying during the Morongo Casino commercial segment 🤣🤣
Only if they witnessed the horror of After Last Season CG scenes
You guys are awesome.  Definitely heighten the way i view media.  Yall did a tier list video. Have you guys though about like, maybe four of you pick contenders for what you think is the Best vfx shot ever?  Do it like debate style. You present your shot and then make the case for it.
Morongo morphing sure seems painful 😭
Not the MCU we need, but the MCU we deserve.
lmao the irony  syfy channel movies have bad CGI while trying to be decent and professional movie literally called bad cgi gator with effects done bad on purpose is actually decent  you can't make this shit up
Real Nephews should be a vfx production company
Well blind wave is going for another god awful Neil Breen film
John Mulaney is my personal favorite asian woman who is actually a white dude.
I feel like Wren should do cereal commercials. His big friendly smile with a clear speaking voice, combined with his boyish looks. He would kill it for sure.
11:49 Logging off Discord
What you said about "Bad CGI Gator" kind of reminds me of those "Going to the store" and "Late for meeting" videos, where the guy did perfect lighting and shadows and stuff, but the animation was intentionally screwed up.
10:55 Wait! Crackers ARE snacks!
you guys should do the laser cats series from SNL
You should react to VHS beyond 😂
That "rhhrrghhhgrrrr" sfx for the morph transition is 🔥
Wren seems like the friendliest person in the world
Neil Breen the goat
9:24 “sometimes some of the best filmmakers…”  It’s as if Neil Breen is a living, breathing “The Picture of Dorian Gray” counterpart to Wes Anderson. 😜
It's clear that nobody here ever lived in Florida because that gator is terrible.
12:50 is the dude with white hair in the background the same actor that plays the old dude with glasses from the first morph?
I can't believe you dained to disrespect his Breenious!
3:43 Im betting it was made with hopes of it being well animated but it wasn't coming together and they decided to remarket it. Ill bet someone struggled to make it legit and that's why you see all those nice touches
Tim & Eric are the undisputed kings of good-bad.
1:46 it’s actually kinda rad how it feels like a stopmotion gator??
My nephew would do it but he’d rather play with R/C trucks and learn about the engineering of flat bed trailers
Obligatory stop doing "Better Help" sponsorships comment. (Seriously though don't support better help)
is like   grum is trying to give us brainwashed
I got the chance to see Big Shark as a double feature w/ the Room.  Good lord is it ever a bad movie. The pacing, the story, the effects are just awful.  I highly recommend you get drunk with your friends and watch it. It’s a riot.
hang on, I just noticed... is the Casino Resort VO done by the guy who voiced John Marston?
Is that Tom Kenny? (Voice of SpongeBob)
I can't believe you did the GOAT Neil Breen
6:19 that is a killer whale not a shark. Grum sounds like Spongebob. 15:10 I thought it was illegal to show someone drink alcohol in a commercial?
More Grum clips. It makes them shut up.
How do you make a parody of shitty horror movies?? They are already a parody of themselves.
13:48 bro said 🎉
I need more of the true MCU.
Sam is everyone on earth "I'm right but I can't prove it."
I was surprised that non of these girls morphed into... Mr. Bean. XD
BetterHelp sponsor!? WTF wrong with you!?
I'm so glad you did some Tim and Eric. They are the best and have some incredible editors. Just the most hilariously bizarre shit.
Is better help part of the bad vfx?
One of the rare "bad vfx" episodes
check out vhs beyond
I do believe the VO on the Morongo Casino commercials is by none other than famed rock/jazz rummer Gregg Bissonette
uuUUUUUUUUUUGGGH
My old Elastic Reality souvenirs...😂 🖖🏻🇫🇷😎🇫🇷😎🇫🇷🖖🏻
11:38 oh if you are doing commercials you need to react to dollynho... thats peak cgi animation.
This add is crazy thought
Legitimately one of the funniest episodes I've ever seen in my life. Had me rolling on the floor.  🤣🤣🤣
16:54 wtf movie is this?😂😂
The woman in the red dress morphing into the creepily smiling Mexican guy will never not make me laugh. It's both unsettling and funny.
I've made a Blender doughnut!  I could totally make a worse cgi gator!
You guys should break down the apple showcase's transition please always wanted to know how the pull those
We’ve got some red letter media fans on the crew
Nah you guys should watch velocipastor or incredible bulk
Neil is the David Lynch of today
The key distinction between good bad and bad bad is it's not funny when you're purposely being shit. It only becomes funny with the idea that somebody tried really hard and it came out horrendously.
13:27 SECRET WARS
"Beasterday: Here Comes Peter Cottonhell"
I think the thing they wanted with Bad CGI Gator was to not take away from the LOOK of the movie, which is why the actual CGI isn't THAT terrible. Like, it's going to match the lighting in a lot of areas, the model itself is going to be high quality. But it needed that little feeling of uncanny added to it. Like, yeah, it's a gator, but stuff just... isn't right. The animations are stiff and rough, the composition of it feels unfinished. But they added some focal points and made the feet go into the grass so it felt like it WAS in the movie. They just did it in a bad way to make fun of the shitty CGI horror films.
Feel like Neil Breen movies are similar to what Michael Scott would make.
Can we do a nephew render challenge?
Tim & Eric are the ONLY guys who can pull off "so bad it's good" _intentionally._ Anything else you can tell it's not genuine, but they manage it somehow.
Stop judging or reviewing other special effects until you can do better because most stuff that was filmed in the 80s and 90s you review are about 99.99% better than what you make today so take it easy you guys
No hate but any vids you make look barley better then Sharknado
Please do a part 2!!!!
"Hi shaaark." 😂
15:14 best part of vid lol
the MCCU
What is amazing about Neil Breen is just how amazingly BAD he is at everything he's doing - acting, writing, effects... are we sure he's not in on the joke? That's like Tim Heidecker levels of troll-y "soooo bad it's good" kinda stuff.
Moragno Casino is a really crappy Casino near Palm Springs. The ad is so perfect for it.
Oh Hi Shark.
if there is a alat of movie abaot big shark the worl will be a better place
The vfx artists who made the morongo commercial are probably so happy someone watched the entire 4 part series
I really would like to see you guys react to some scenes from Hardcore Henry, specifically the motorcycle chase scene
Bad CGI Gator has the same problem as Velocipastor: the main foundation of funny-bad movies is "an earnest attempt that doesn't work out." If you're trying to make it bad on purpose, it's really hard (if not impossible) to turn off your subconscious artist brain to make things a bit better than they otherwise would be from a non-artist. It's very common for an expert to overestimate the average person's knowledge of their subject, and it shows in Bad CGI Gator.
They did a very similar morph in a one direction music video
If you look in the gas’s behind them you can see everything😂
Sam has the best laugh, when he cracks up, I can't help but crack up... i find myself smashing the subscribe/unsubscribe repeatedly, and it's all Sam's fault
I feel like you guys simultaneously gave Neil Breen way too much credit and not enough.  The thing with him is that he's not in on the joke at all. He truly thinks his movies are amazing. I know this because if you're an idiot, or lover of all terrible filmmakers, or both, you can spend over $200Cad to get the first 5 of his movies plus a special look "behind the scenes" where Neil talks about his motivation and filmmaking process. And from that you will hear and see how he takes his "movies" very seriously.     Hell, he even lies to make his "effects" seem more impressive (ex: that colorful forest scene that opened the clip you showed. He talks about how he created it himself, but a quick reverse google shows its an unchanged desktop background that comes with MS Windows) .     He brags about the "professional actors" he hires, which is obviously bullsh*t. And in his first three movies (or 4, but I'm not going to subject myself to his movies again to see if I'm right or not) he went very far out of his way during writing to ensure he got full nudity scenes with his always beautiful and MUCH younger female co-stars who oddly find his wrinkled leathery skin and botchy Breen balls absolutely irresistible, (The scenes also made zero sense to the "plot" and were extremely awkward to watch, but hey.. that wasn't the point of having them in the script). And the nude scenes were always locked off perfectly so we can all see jarring, unnecessary Breen balls.   And every movie has the same plot (more or less)- He's either a super hacker, author, alien hybrid who's irresistible to young, beautiful women. Or he's just an irresistible alien hybrid here to either save or destroy the world , or an irresistible alien god thing who's here to save or destroy the world... You get the point.     Ultimately he's just a rich guy who wanted to make his own movies where he's the hero who always gets the girl. But he knows NOTHING about how to create a interesting story, nothing about pacing, the importance of visual storytelling and how actual humans behave in real life.  His editing is also extremely bizarre.. Continuity is all over the place and can be painful to try to understand the choices made.. Good lord, I could go on and on and on ( I kinda have!)   Sorry for writing a whole masters thesis on Neil's movies, but I'm a hatefan of his. I've  paid for his movies (Over $200 for the last 5 movies) to support his work because he's living a dream of mine. I would love to have the resources and time to keep making my own movies. So I respect Neils hustle and vision. He's just really REALLY bad at this. (Check out the scene where his best friend gets killed in his movie "Fateful Findings" for some top notch Breen emotions.)
Seeing you guys react to Grum made my day. I sing Grum's crackers and snacks song all the time, and seeing it here KILLED me.
I love when good work gets noticed. Good job guys!
Were the gator's feet blending into the grass, or clipping through an invisible floor plane?
You guys should do mighty Joe Young. The practical and visual effects are impressive for the '90s
>four months ago they "joked" about the "REAL MCU"  >and now...
Better help is a scam
My friends and I are massive Neil Breen fans, love to see him represented
this episodde its peak hahaha MCU for life
You guys should cover Bad CGI Sharks. Gator just ripped our idea off after meeting with our team.
Breen loves using a Breenscreen
I honestly forgot about this movie, I saw a trailer for bad bad cgi gator and I wanted to see it. Now I have to
If you want more like Grum but made entirely genuinely, check out Guther's Pond. Old weird PBS/Christian type cartoon with some phenomenally bad animation.
Looking back, tim & Eric are probably why I grew up the way I did 😭
Isn't Better Help a scammy company that sells your information ignoring all HIPPA regulations? Not even anonymizing your data, so it's clear as day who you are. Hope the Corridor Crew caught on to this scam and are dropping them.
Pillgrum reminds me of Ratboy Genius.
Around 10:02 the way the director guy says that line, makes me think of the "Happier With Your Mouth Open" skit from WKUK, I love it haha
|CAN YOU PLEASE LOOK INTO|  Dinotopia TV Mini Series (2002)  Director: Marco Brambilla . Starring Actor - Wentworth Miller. & The Last Starfighter (1984)  Director: Nick Castle. Starring Actor - Lance Guest.
I thought my APD kicked in when Wren did the intro but it turns out he really did say that 💀💀😭
The velocipastor
8:00: I, too, had the same reaction upon witnessing the cinematic genius that is Neil Breen.
Plz do Velocipastor
Don't accept better help sponsors
that into was hilarious lol
You guys should watch the bearcano series
Better help IS a scam look it up before trying
Guys, better help sells your data. Look it up. Just stop using them as a sponsor. Your audience trusts you.
i hope you guys will do more reactions to vfx in commercials
Morongo is a loop? -- you can never leave, the casino has hold of you now
I’m again we have a great reset all movies become destroyed except these and they’re the only proof of our civilisation
When will you look into Wunwun's death from GOT. There is a crossbow bolt that deserves your attention
You guys should do an episode on Doctor Who. The CGI and VFX in that show has not progressed since 2005
You guys have to react to Cade the tortured passing 😂
This is the best one yet
very nice, thank you
Ъ.
For me this is just peak entertainment 😅😅 love all these reactions, so dope 🤙
16:01 Animorphs!
Honestly thankyou guys That "real nephews" line just killed me.... im actually crying at how funny that was.
why did my mind instantly go to “indians” when he said nephews?
based tim and eric
"They got blender installed last week, THEY CAN DO 3D ANIMATION"..... And I took that personally.
The worst thing about those morphs is the implication that his glasses are somehow biological; they are mimic-glasses much like a butterfly has fake eyes on its wings. Absolutely mortifying
I see the Morongo Casino commercial all the time. Thank you for covering it. It is so 🤔😂
I am fairly sure they were not intentionally trying to make a parody of bad cgi creature movies. They just werent happy with the cgi halfway through post and decided to lean into it and rush the rest or something.
do Gaither's Pond
That moment, when you hear your own music in Corridor Crew video because it was used in Tommi Wiseau movie trailer....- DOUBLE KILL!
Oh, hai, Shark!!!
This guys sponsored segments are the worst!
I like crackers and snacks
Wren’s facial expressions make this episode
Wasn’t this channel name: Corridor Corridor Crew Corridor Digital Cooridor Crew?  Someone remind me
I follow the girl from the MCU commercial at 13:18 on ig 😂
please remake Neil Breen movie with decent cgi.
You guys, BetterHelp does not compensate therapists fairly.
Haha, I wonder how wide Wren's eyes would go if he watched Cool 3D World videos X)
Skrull
ok nvm its already done
شما هم ایزج ملکی دارین
The pilgrim is my new sleep paralysis deamon 😱
Keeping up with the commercials and so bad its good cgi, theres a pretty popular Brazilian meme of a bagged milk mascot called barriguinha mole, and it is a masterpiece, you should definitely react to it
No more shaking hands and hugs only the cracker and snacks dance is the only acceptable greeting gesture and we have to sing the song 😂😂😂😂😂
Not sure if you guys have ever reacted to it but if you haven't check out 1940's Thief of Bagdad, the first movie to ever use blue screen.
Please please react to Emma Watson mask take off
Do they have a third person in the middle of the first mcu morphing?
I’ve never laughed some much and learned about  VFX. 😅
You guys should check out Michael Jackson's Ghost shortfilm
These effects are so bad💀
I watch corridor crew from vfx artist react to stunt man react every new video. And now im want a vfx and stunt man funny reaction. 😂
they are imitating bad CGI from movies, so in a way it is the most realistic CGI ever
another great video^^
There are a lot of movies released in India recently. With low budget but good effects like 2018, Hanu man, and big budget but low quality effects like aadipurush.
Can you guys please talk about the fake pile of garbage in the sopranos season 2 episode 11.
As an Australian, the Roof Seal ads are some of the worst CGI i've ever seen. I highly recommend everybody check it out.
The morphs are bad because they are bait and switching hot women for goofs lol
@corridor please take a look at „Hardcore Henry“ next for vex artists react
You guys are gonna have a field day with Ferrari (2023). Hahaha
Neil Breen=Red Letter Media
How long after release until we get to see Godzilla Minus One? Maybe an episode dedicated to Minus Color? With them saying they completely reworked shots to be black & white, that could be a great episode with some other black & white references
7:25 I was thinking Uwe Boll
I recommend you check out Nobuhiko Obayashi’s films from the 2010s specifically Casting Blossoms To The Sky, Labyrinth of Cinema, and Hanagatami. The director manages to tell some powerful stories while using some vfx that is not so great. He embraces cinema to the fullest potential.
*morph* EUUUURRRGH
Dragon ball evolution
I don't usually comment but I would like to see them react to both the stunts and the VFX of the live action Yu yu hakusho. The cgi is a mix of cool and terribad, but the fight scene choreo is amazing in my opinion
I think I found an absolute gem! It's called Grand Auto Theft: LA This one is so great, you'll all love it. Top 5 best worst movies ever and the cg is incredible 😂
you should watch Alien Shark!
Please look over “shark side of the moon” it’s a small indie film on a 10k budget and I honestly don’t hate it when I realized what they did with what they had
watch the womans drink!! there's 2 on the table, she grabs one, and one stays behind!
Wren was the wrong one to have on the couch. Just sucks all the air out of the room when the other fuys actsully deliver the jokes. Should've been Niko instead.
straight outta comped - in
Would be cool to see someone like Tommy on the couch 😅
New series: NEPHEW CHALLENGE
We need the Corridor Crew and Red Letter Media crossover that I know so many of us thought of as soon as Neil Breen showed up.
wren looks horrified throughout this video
Neal Breen!?? You guys have to collaborate with @redlettermedia
The Morongo Cinematic Universe stuff was hilarious
Hey, have you guys ever done anything of Vuorensola's? Anything from Star Wreck to Iron Sky?
Gaddanging, I actually almost choked on my tea for that "real nephews" comment XD
I'd love for y'all to look at a few David Twohy movie as an example for someone who uses very limited budgets as a creative challenge and usually pulls it off pretty well. Pitch Black is the prime example for this; the CG monsters have aged terribly, but honestly, the rest of it, the acting, the cinematography, the mood, it all still works. He pulls this off with barebones sets and heavy colour grading and- well, I'd like to hear from you which tricks he's using!
4:02 thats me :))
Ratboy genius   I say no more.
Chuck and Aaron Norris films.
Jordan slays. Both Jordans slay.
please do the missy elliot music video "lose control" and see her face replacement when shes dancing in the sand
Eyes on Breen!
Morongo is so f***ing stoked to get this kind of exposure and attention on their trailblazing narrative animations.
Hi, it's me again BEGGING you to bring the live action Devilman from 2004 to the show!
SHE WAS HOT AND>>>THEN NOPE!
Casinomatic universe.
Love from India... tollywood... You must watch "SALAAR"... it's hero Prabhas (Bahubali hero).
Not sure if this is VFX or animators react but you guys should do the TV show Reboot about characters who live inside a computer. If for VFX specifically then react to the quality difference between seasons 1-3 and season 4. Love the you guys!
Please have a look at the digital cold breath on TED TV Series S01E06 @ 32:38
please do a VFX artist react to virus (1999)
You should view the AYALAAN kollywood film vfx breakdown...It's really cool and real
You guys should check out the effects in Percy Jackson and the lightning thief specifically the water scene around 34 mins 30 secs. I thought they were pretty good!
guys you should definitely look at spawn, the transformation scene.
Please do try to react to the VFX of the Indian movie "JAWAN", starring Shah Rukh Khan
I just finished the Echo series and there is some fantastic special effects detailing a bird in episode 5, right at the start. Looks totally real and would love for you guys to see it if you haven’t!
You guys should make a redo of the Black Or White morphs. Cycle through all the Corridor staff. Just to see how easy (or how much better) it can be done with modern technology.   (What's Black Or White? Like, 30 years ago?)
Alvin and the chipmunks vfx artist react!
You guys should do a segment on all of those mid-2000s music video using early CGI. Think Nü Metal like Linkin Park and Evanescence, that Butterfly song, or anything from The Matrix soundtrack.
This is one of the best episodes! Gotta have these 3 back on the couch together again! The chemistry is unbeatable!
The middle guys face everytime 😂😂😂
The pilgrims could be in   a ghost busters film
I know my voice is a whisper in this group but if you happen to see my comment you need to search for a clip of a guy called Godfrey doing an impression of denzel Washington the deep fake is so smooth
Have you guys ever done anything from the movie Cube or Cube 2 hypercube?! You guys do so many of my favorite old movies and I'd love to see those. Also the movie The Cell and The Fall (same director)
Love this channel, keep on doing what you do best! I’d love to see a section where you react to real good AI art vs. human digital art and try to tell which one is which!
OMG yall need to do a FULL F’ing episode on Sin City!
You really need to look at the car bomb scene from Velocipastor.
I love you guys, you help me find so many good movies. I wanted to tell you of a ridiculous VFX movie called The Terminators. Just fifteen minutes in and I'm laughing my head off at the simplistic FX.
Talk about the kingdom of Heavan next time.
i learned about Neil Breen from RLM . god bless them.
Really? Morongo? Moron go? 🤦‍♂️
Can you make the best scenes of the amazing world of gumball r rated
One of the worst cgi shots I’ve seen is the Grenade Launcher scene in Hardcore Henry, which is strange since other shots, CG and physical stunts are actually quite solid for an experience of an action film
Random not great CGI: Princess Diaries 2, the airport in her country isn't bad, CGI... its Decent CGI Gator CGI. LOL!
Request: Robot Jox from 1989. Gloriously shonky stop motion plus an insane quantity of cheese.

Can you guys review AI created videos and talk about ways that you can recreat it yourselves. There's this AI video called Pookky Park which is haunting.
These guys couldn't live through morphs of The Offspring - The Kids Aren't Alright   music video
Next time review the CGI effects in Lift. You'll have a field day
3:55 when your boss crack a silly joke 😬
You guys should go over Blizzard cinematics. They are on such a level it looks real now.
Do more unexplainable phenomenons there awesome 😂
Saw the movie "Dragon Soldiers" the other day. Truly some CGI in that uhhhhhhh   *gem*.
You should check out the video: CLONE WARS: BATTLE OF THE HEROES - A Star Wars Fan Animation  by the channel: HELLO THERE   Love to see what you think
Haven't watched since like a year ago what happened to Clint?

Bro react on jawan movie vfx breakdown by red chilis india
recommending SPACE TRUCKERS - Stuart Gordon (Re-Animator, From Beyond, Robot Jox),  starring Dennis Hopper, Stephen Dorff - about  dudes driving a truck in space.  - only saw trailer, but the memory lives on.
seems noone want's to do anything but reactions anymore ... lazy imho ... unsubed
React to red chillies VFX breakdown of the new movie jawan it stars srk 👌
special guest suggestion: craig McPherson, i know him and he is a really nice guy and has worked on many films. he was the animation supervisor on ant man, Jumanji the next level, men in black international and he worked on two episodes of love death and robots. also he animated on district 9, happy feat, hulk and edge of tomorrow.
I'd be interested to see you all react to nature documentary vfx. I was watching a cool one on if Yellowstone erupted, and it made me think of you guys.
Remember when you guys fixed the scorpion king? Can you fix the bathroom scene from The Terminator? It’s practical effects but really bad by modern standards and really dates the movie and i think improvement to that one scene would really elevate the movie overall
Just wondering if there has been any analysis of vfx used in music videos (some of which are very film like) in any previous episodes. For example, I am wondering how many of the shots in Dua Lipa's music video Houdini is smokes and mirrors.
I’d love to hear your thoughts on the car crash VFX in “Ferrari.” There are some questionable rag doll sims going on
Rum had me shooooooooooook
God bless this mess! (Says this athiest) 🤢
You guys HAVE to check out the film Robot Jox Circa 1989. I personally think the stop-motion holds up now, but the film itself is so awful it's good!   I'll comment once a week until you guys see this... haha!
You guys should remake the casino blending/morphing effect
Tip:  The Peasants or Loving Vincent,  Interesting animated films from Poland animated from 1000s of oil paintings.
You need to look at "Big Ass Spider!", the CGI is absolutely horrendous
The legend of Tarzan is pretty rough vfx. It'd be cool to see yall talk about that
THE BREEN CUT
I love how they had the most good things to say about the cgi that was TRYING to be bad.
Did you reviewed Sucker Punch? If you dont you should
13:54 I do much more video editing than VFX work, but I've had to work with green screen and/or plates that other people have shot before and I can relate to this moment lol.
Check out Bad taste by Peter Jackson.
Can you guys react to Gods of Egypt? Specifically the waterfall fight scene. I just saw it for the first time and WOWOWOWOW it's rough. Definitely should've hired Blender Nephew.
You've made multiple rated R versions of movies but haven't you tried making "matilda" rated R because I noticed some scary scenes in the movie that could be perfect for rated R horror.
The entire beer coming out of the water at 7:04 being half full and still containing beer is hilarious.

Leo Tamil movie hyna scene review please
You guys should do blues brothers, I'm watching it right now and there are some interesting effects. Some bad, but there are others that are insane practical effects

Tina and the T-rex has some of the greatest shots I've ever seen
Animators react needs to do killer beans
In the new percy jackson the underwater scene in the new episode!? Air comes out of his nose but not out of his mouth when be talks, pretty cool because he has to look like he is breathing underwater
Pretty sure the guy who made The Room is not self aware at all. I saw someone ask if he was intentionally trying to capitalize on the campiness of The Room with this new movie and he lost his shit on the fan. Went nuts yelling at him for making fun of his movies. Either he’s fully committed to the bit or he genuinely thinks his movies are amazing
I think y'all should critique stick animations. The best and worst of "Stick People ™" VFX
Request: Xavier Renegade Angel for next Bad & Worse CGI (spoilers: it’s actually awesome)

There is a movie called Shark side of the moon, if you neeed one to add to this series
The cgi in Spiderman Lotus was incredible, rest of the "film", not so much
Watch ganpath and adipurush (and please don't make fun of adipurush characters those are religious character but you can make fun of VFX)
Dammit, guys, now I am going to instinctively make a straining, retching noise every time I see a morph shot in something.  That was hilarious.
Yo, I'd recommend looking at the Titanfall 2 cinematic trailer. THAT SHIT ROCKS
You should check out Dennou Keisatsu Cybercop, it's a Japanese tokusatsu show from 1988. But the digital effects look like they're from a high school study hall computer in 1981. Episode 4 is particularly memorable.
You should watch the amazing bulk
Hey check out redchillies jawan vfx breakdown you will just love it
I would love for you guys to react to Dr.Who. 60 plus years of visual and practical FX
The opening scene of the new season of True Detective. The caribou don’t look quite right, really took me out of it.
you should look at those bad ads for Gaming Especially matchington Mansion and reanimate them to be successful
Please review the Echo’s horrible stunts and CGI. PLEASE 👏👏👏
I don’t think you have done these, but I’d be interested in your views on “The BFG” (2016) for a VFX artists react video, and “Singing in the Rain” for the “make em laugh” physical comedy scene with Donald O’Connor for stuntmen react. There is also a windy dream sequence that seems too big to be an entire stage scene that I think is interesting.
It's seriously called Moron Go Casino? So Brilliant.
Poor Nice stared into the abyss on this one.
Suggestion for review: Reacher S1 Ep 8,  41:24 into the ep, full cgi tear drop running from Reacher's eyeball down his cheek.  The path the fluid takes is ok, but the rendering completely fucks the entire shot.
will you make a decent cgi gator
I want to see a rated r version of the 3 amegos!!
I’d love to see an episode cover the final episode of the curse.
"they should have hired real nephews" is a top 3 Sam quote for sure
Bit random but I'd love to see you have a look at a Chinese film that has an awesome cast just completely puts you off when you see the trailer - The Monkey King from 2014! Do the effects negate the cast??!!
Would really love to see you guys talk about how the really old stuff, like Metropolis (1927), was made.
Video idea- one shots are popular. A sequence or entire film that appears to be done in one long take. Marvel TV have done a couple of extended fight scenes in one take. How many ways can you hide a cut?
Try Sharknado
Where is Devinsupertramp!? Corridor and Devin seem like a match made in heaven.
I gotta see a breakdown of the final jump of Free Willy (1993). I watched that movie so many times as a kid and never realized how much CGI they used (because I was 6-years-old).
You could do a whole series on just low-budget commercial VFX. I've got links for daaaays.
Those gator shots were done by them
Honestly Neil Breen is a legend. 10/10 on including him on one of these.   His movies get progressively worse as time goes on.
I would love see a full Neil Breen episode!!!!
I love they showed the morongo casino ad, I thought the same things when I watch it on tv. Bonus i live near the casino
That was the hardest I've laughed in a while, Sam.
react to the first deepfake shot: Tales from the crypt S6.E15 "You, Murderer" directed by zemeckis just after forest gump
Dear corridor crew check out this movie Inuyashiki
Neil Breen, OHHHHHH MYYYYYYYYYYY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOODDDDDDDDD
Red chillies VFX realeased a new video of VFX breakdown of movie JAWAN, now we need new part of VFX artists reacts to Bollywood
Avatar the Last Airbender is coming out.  Would love to see “VFX” make the movie rated R, or Good, or dub over all the name mispronunciations that made the movie version unwatchable.
Pause the video at 2:12 and set playback speed to 0.25 before you hit play. You're welcome.
I'd love to see them have some of the newer blood who didn't take part in making them go back and react to their old shots and guess who worked on what.
am i the only one that saw the glass still there when the women picked it up at 16:28
New crazy idea just pop off my head, you guy should do practical effects challange. Just saying😅
You are getting boring day by day .... Bring more stuntmen react.
Why wren is so overreacting, everyone else seems fine.
Please check out the movie ayalaan
hey guys, please check out Inuyashiki (2018), got some pretty cool VFX, and very anime action sequences!
Have you guys done Ace Lightning? It was one of the early Canadian kids shows that mixed live action and CGI characters. You can see the budget increase in the second season and then drop in the third. I thought that I dreamed it as a kid leaving the TV on all night and waking up at 5am everyday.
LOOK AT: "Spider Man - Lotus", the opening sequence.
I would love to see you guys react to a Kamen Rider show, like Shin Kamen Rider for instance, or any other shows at all.
You should do a full Tim and Eric episode! They have so much wild and twisted vfx
I think the Pillgrums gave Wren emotional damage.
I didn't know I needed more Morango!
make a video about a new movie AYALAAN in Tamil...
AND NIECES
Please do the head elf in Fred Claus
Do the vfx conversation about *AYALAAN* tamil movie
For the next edition of this you really should watch all 69 episodes of "Skibidi Toilet" - it's an unsung masterpiece!
recreated mirror seen from "contact" in Berlin Show??? Can you guys react to Berlin Episode 2 around 29min, there's a scene that turns out to be a reflection and it reminded me of when you guys reacted to the scene from contact and it blew my mind in Berlin. Simply because I was never expecting a scene like that from the show. Berlin is chasing after a woman and the camera is like right in front of him as he walks down an entire hallway, just for you to find out it is a reflection when he reaches her. I've watched it severoul times and it still boggles me.
You guys really need to react to the fights in the movie Upgrade
oh my god - the fact that they reacted to GRUM makes me insanely happy 😂😂😂
Morongo the shapeshifter is a dope ass villain idea.
Be great to see you guys react to video games like God of War, The Last of us, Returnal ect
You guys should react to Indiana Jones 5, particularly the opening sequence with the Young CG Harrison Ford. Especially since ILM has a video up right now that shows how they did it.
FYI, just in case you’re interested, the same crypto scammers who hacked you guys a while back just hacked another massive influencer called Pegasus.
The Eden Formula. Bad movie. Pretty sure I reemember there being points where you can tell they used a plastic dinosaur toy, but it's been awhile since I've seen it. I just know it was pretty bad at points that my friend and I laughed about it.
The Crew has CGI Stockholm syndrome
U guys shoud make a movie with neel.
damn this is one of their best videos been a while
almost 200 episodes and theyre finally doing bad and worse
you guys should take a look at the CGI in an Apple TV Series called 'INVASION'
I'm not really getting what they're making fun of in the Morongo ads. I mean, the concept of the ads is kind of weird, with all the guests morphing into each other, but it seems like VFX guys are also goofing on the FX of the morphs, and... I dunno. They look OK to me. They seem like pretty standard morphs you'd see on a TV show or something.
The team working on that bad cgi gator movie knew exactly what they were doing the whole time. Every detail, or lack there of, has to be intentional. Pure speculation
Josh chadWick II
It's morphin time!
sam is so upset at big shark, i get it tho, someone is tainting the purity behind the comedy of "hi Mark"
Never in a million years did I expect to see Grum on an episode of VFX reacts
At 16:28 her glass is still in the background plate! Even after she picks it up. Amazing.
Yall should tackle the studio KING of Low budget films "The Asylum" who film their stuff in one week!  Just caught some of their newer sci-fi film "Martian Land" and it was surprisingly creative I thought for how low the budget is!
U guys should definitely look at AYALAAN....latest Tamil movie with ton of vfx
Yes the Morongo casino commercial!  So bad its good!
THIS WWAS ONE OF THE MOST HILARIOUS 'VFEX' ARTIST REACT VIDEO EVERRRRRRR everrrrrrrr!!
Please look at llamageddon!  Not a ton of vfx but definitely worth a laugh
Garth marenghi's "dark place" the best worst TV ever made.
You can't fake a good bad movie, it had to come naturally.
The sound effects on the reactions are getting a bit too much IMO
Please review the finale of The Curse xo
You should review the movie The Retirement Plan. It just was just bad
Hey wren, pacific rim Jaegers, *when???*
please bollywood reaction brahmastra
Do 'Blue Eye Samurai'. Lots of VFX based off of a real stunt team.
6:01 I think that is Wren's most cringe moment of all time, somehow. bless his heart
If you ever do an award for 'Uncanniest Valley', I'd like to nominate 'Cinderella: Once Upon a Time in the West'.
Can you guys review the final scene from Nathan Fielder's, The Curse? Would love to see any breakdowns about how it was done!
Ok guys guys, hear me out…you MUST MUST MUST do Joshua and the promised land.
Challange idea: Make Wren not cringily wojack at something in a completely out of proportion manner for one episode
I remember this channel called Really3D, the animation was so scuffed that it was very funny.
Not the MCU we wanted but the MCU we needed
I really love your videos thank you ❤❤❤❤🎉
Please can you create a video demonstrating how large 1000 acres of land is ? 😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶
My face hurts from laughing at the morph sound effects. This was the best!
12:18 it is not that bad morph  you have much worse today that you can use in you  clips this was pretty decent for a year it was released
14:55 I could cry. it's so funny. Such a good meme template 🤣  "Is this the last one? NO! WHAT?!" 🤣
I know this is vfx artist react but could you guys to Rango sometime please🙏🏼
Would love to hear what the guys thought of the VFX in Rebel Moon.
You guys should watch the last episode of The Curse. Unexpected jawdropping special effects right there
Call Raplhp Bakshi for Animators React!
React on hanuman movie from tollywood.
first time seeing Sam losing it 😂
my favourite one from recently was in Nine Perfect Strangers. Melissa McCarthy is driving to a wellness retreat and wearing mirrored sunglasses and they completely forgot to remove the cameraman and the full rig from her glasses. However, cut to like 5 seconds later and the cameraman is replaced with a road that looks like it's out of 1980s Atari Pole Position, just flat green either side with a grey road in the middle, and this doesn't change even though she's then driving through the woods!
Please don’t work with sponsores, that sold personal data and health issues to third parties for ad targeting 😢
Can you look at Kamen Rider CG??? It’s usually a hit or miss. I think an example of a hit would be the Kabuto rain clock up scene. This was a series from 2006. A miss would be when Touma from Saber ran up an imaginary staircase
BTW Neil never uses greenscreen. He uses a much better technique called Breenscreen.
Check out shin ultraman and shin kamen rider!
Did you guys ever cover Walking with Dinosaurs?
I just saw a morph of a little girl and a chicken in the 2020 film the witches that will haunt my dreams for a while, between that and all the Anne hathaway it's a stomach turner😳
You must do vfx reacts for Jawan (2023)
I've read something fishy about BetterHelp, like one of those other previous sponsors that went down because of being a scam and fishy.
It was the beginning of the video and I was typing up a comment to look at bad cgi gator I just finished the comment and they start talking about it
Wren has the best reaction in this channel.
16:38 they are geniuses, they put a bright green wall behind the composite so they dont have to worry about carefully keying the green screen.
The only channel I keep checking from time to time, because YouTube doesn't show me you new uploads for some reason!
This is the most episode yet
You are making research less videos😔😔😔 There are many industries in India : Tollywood -bahubali : kollywood- robo : Bollywood- --- 🟥⬛🟥⬛🟥⬛🟥⬛🟥⬛🟥⬛🟥⬛🟥⬛⬛🟥⬛🟥⬛🟥🟥⬛🟥⬛🟥🟥⬛🟥⬛🟥⬛🟥🟥⬛🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥⬛⬛🟥⬛🟥⬛🟥⬛🟥🟥🟥🟥⬛🟥⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛🟥⬛🟥⬛🟥🟥🟥⬛
12:14 Is that Alan from VLDV?
Was that a snuck in sfx at 13:49 or am I tripping. LMAO, could've been Wren squeaking...
I just heard about a new "AI" tool called HeyGen which linguist and phonetician Dave Huxtable recently tried out in his channel. You upload a video recording of you speaking and it translates the in your own voice and lip-syncs impressively well. If you make Anime Rock Paper Scissors 3, it could be fun to try a tool like this on your raw footage to translate it into Japanese before you apply the animation effects.
Bad CGI Gator vs Llamageddon
Anti-Life flamethrowers!
hey video idea, nephews make your shortfilm
The noises they made for each transition on the casino ad was the funniest shit ever 😂😂😂😂
Oh hi Shark
React to YOUR own worst VFX videos you've made
Comment🫡
Bad CGI Gator more like "Whoops! Good CGI Gator" They're VFX artists and they just can't help themselves to do the shading right.
Do some Dr. Who!  I recommend the first two episodes of the 2005 reboot, specifically the garbage can eating someone and the "last human"
This episode broke Wren
What are your thoughts on the Buffalo from the Buffalo Wild Wings Commercials? I wonder if you'd take a dive into some commercials, either new or classic nostalgia
I havent laughed that hard in a minute need more MCU
There is some janky CGI in the intro of Cult of Chucky. Weird janky CGI baby
vfx artist reveals skibidi toilet size
Entire episode is just Wren getting mind fu*ked
Ok, now I need to see the MCU morphs with Julia from Drawfee doing the "eeuuuugh" sound. (The sound Julia makes when she reads The New Yorker)
Have you had a look at Peter Gabriel's Sledgehammer music video? Pretty awesome.
Y’all should watch Joshua and the promised land, it’s truly a masterpiece of horrible computer animation
This episode made me lol so much.
Hilarious! Fancy a casino naming their business "Moron go" 🤣
Omigod you guys, Neil Breen Twisted Pair, this is the Corridor Crew/Red Letter Media crossover I have been waiting for! Best wishes for 2024, everyone!
I think this is the last place to show something from neil breen. Now im afraid were is the next place he will appear. Also: for badness on this level i suggest The Tuxedo, that one with Jackie Chan. He said he accepted to do this movie based on a chance to work with heavy fx and cgi, and while it wasn't top shelf (movie and effects) the bad really lies in the composition on the scenes. And pretty much everything else.
I want to see a stuntmen react, to the Knox vs. Eli fight from "Boardwalk Empire". How a scene can be choreographed for what actually looks like two guys just trying to kill each other as opposed to something slick.
Honestly i find the bad cgi gator to be oddly charming. Like it reminds me of all those old bad monster movies i used to watch.
You guys HAVE to do the FLASH! Most of the cgi in it was so bad, so uncanny valley! 😵‍💫 And that opening scene with the babies was the WORST thing I’ve seen in years! Please, PLEASE review it!
Okay, listen.  I'm sippin' some wine at the exact moment the lady morphed into the older guy and those noises they were making almost had wine flying out of my nostrils.
You should check out more old timey music videos. Like Enya's Carribean Blue.
I can't believe how realistic they got those jiggle physics at 1:49 in that Bad CGI Gator movie.  You guys should be talking about that. 😬😉 You got too caught up in critiquing the gator instead of the real action on screen. 😬🤣
The problem with "Bad CGI Gator" is that, by having the effects be intentionally bad, there's no charm unlike with most monster movies with bad CG monsters where they're presented like that's how the final effects look, like they really thought *THAT* looked passable, thus it maes the experience more fun because of the incompetence.  But making the CG effects bad on purpose and straight up telling the audience that the effects are gonna be bad?  I'm just gonna quote the Smeghead from Cinematic Excrement when the reviewed "Birdemic II: The Resurrection:"  _"If you want to fail and you succeed... what did you actually do?"_
hahahahah men... i was eating when i watched this ep... almost, almost.
PLEASE STOP PROMOTING BETTERHELP! They are a HORRIBLE company…
I want the crew to watch ratboy genius next, thats some premium bad cgi.
Heyyy you should really react to this super cool short film. Its called: A young boy encounters a downed German pilot after witnessing a large aerial battle. | Turning Tide They had a pretty low budget and pulled off some super cool airplane shots. Thanks!
Man, I sure love this new series, Veefex! I hope you guys keep making more of them!
Please reconsider the BetterHelp sponsorship. They're being investigated by the FTC for selling customer data and predatory marketing
React to latest bollywood film Bad CGI  ADIPURUSH pleaseee.... Love from India♥️
This totally reminded me watching Birdemic 1 and sadly 2 and 3 also. Check it out
Matrix reloaded fight scene with multiple Smiths.. just noticing shadows that present on branches versus non-existence on multiple Smith's
I was wondering if you guys had seen Devotion, the WWII dog-fighting movie. Even though it has high-end effects, they clearly look like assets cobbled together. It fails to convince in nearly every scene even though it isn’t obvious exactly why.
Grum is the Pinnacle of animation quality
An episode without nico? I can get behind that
You guys need to do Lifeforce.
Morongo? Definitely not Morightgo.
Oh god those Morongo commercials are so disorienting 😩. Not sure why they didn't just have one person sit down at the table, have the next person be sitting next to them, pan the camera to the next person, they stand up and walk to a different game. Rinse and repeat. It would've been so much easier and create a much more enjoyable commercial
You guys should do a stop motion artists react of pinchcliff. A true classic in stop motion
That gator still looks better than Lake Placid's gators.
You guys should check out the movie Sssssss. That movie has some unforgettable cgi
I think the director of that gator movie made it just for this show. Hoping he would, someday, make it into a VFX video on Corridor Crew's YouTube channel.
Is Neil Breen the "How could you commit suicide?" guy?
such a huge missed opportunity that you didnt end with each of you morphing into someone else :(
please bring Sam on more, he so funny.
Have you guys looked at the morphing stuff in Alex Garlands film 'Men'?  There is some very strange stuff right at the end
Please react to the movie trailer HanuMan, a low budget (4-5 million USD) Indian Super Hero movie.. There is a bad CGI/VFX shot where the hero is in a race with a Cheetah.. They couldn't improve it so they removed the sequence in the movie..
Nephews dont use Blender, they pirate Maya because they need the very best LOL
Day 1 of commenting until they react to Athishayan
You NEED to make a fnaf movie R-rated cut please!!!
react to xavier renegade angel! mix of bad CGI and semi-random-vulgar humor i think you guys would love
Day 5 of asking for an Animusic recreation.
_"they should have hired REAL nephews"_ That got me so good 😆
Stop stealing from the Nephew Culture, As I nephew I demand this appropriation must stop.
Please react to the magical legend of the leprechauns
Next  time can you look at gods of egypt and everything from the Disney remakes
I have to watch that Morongo commercial every damn night...
If you guys do another special effects artists react you should cover fire in the sky it has incredible practical effects
you should do an episode where youre all just cgi, so its a VFX Artists React instead of a VFX Artists React
Recreate the morphs
Glad to see you finally talk about Neil Breen 😂
React to the cat in the Lego Ninjago Movie. It looks so good
please do a special episode about Vídeo Brinquedo! and another special episode about The Asylum! PLEASE!!!
Watching the extended editions is always a draw to subscribing because each VFX Artists React episode on YouTube is just that good!   But there is no desire to watch the extended version of this episode.  It literally hurt my eyes to watch it and I wish I could unsee that whole segment on Pillgrums.  BTW:  Has anyone checked on Wren since this was taped?  Based on his reactions he may also be suffering from PTSD - Pillgrum Traumatic Stress Disorder.
The Bad CGI Gator segment reminded me of an episode of King of the Hill where Hank Hill purposefully tries to make his house fail an inspection for insurance reasons or something; but the inspector sees right through it and commends him by saying that it would take a true craftsman who knows his stuff and takes care of his home perfectly to create such a "bad" condition for his house.
Theyre pickint at bad CGI gator for looking too good, but its bad CGI gator, not poorly comped gator
Hey I think it would be neat to cover the effects of the last episode of The Curse. There are some neat concepts and it would be cool to get na idea of how they were accomplished
Bahubali 2 :- 1) climax full fight scene and  villain death scene.
I would love you guys to do a mini series where you “fix” Neal Breen films.
Neil Breen is a genius. He's played the VERY long con. I refuse to accept that he is a delusional film maker...
This was a blast!!! For Animators React I would LOVE to see you talk about Blue Eye Samurai!!
You should try to 'fix' the bad cgi of the casino
🥺what happened to the corridor crew team after 2023?
You should do the morph thing as in the commercial with your team
This is great! You guys really should do more bad CGI/VFX like this. Most "good and bad" videos you do almost all include only good nowadays, That's amazing as well of course, but this stuff is just hilarious
"Hire real nephews" absolutely destroyed me.
Neil Bren- the Ed Wood of the 21st century.
Seeing Neil is always a treat
With Neal Breen we have a lovely union of So Bad it’s Good and VFX reacts! Love it!
You should react to commercials of a brazilian soda called Dolly and their cgi mascot Dollyinho
What about “Hollow Man” with Kevin Bacon?
the ironman 3 end scene where robert downey jr face is cg i never knew this till recently
Have yall not heard how evil better help is yet?
Nooooooooooooooo wheres niko 😢
Is Bad CgI Gator is related to Bad CGI Sharks from a while back
My dream is to get Tim and Eric on the couch, from Awesome Show Great Job,  with Jordan in the middle ❤
You can also tell it's greenscreen when you see the artifact on the glass @16:27
Breen is an untouchable God in the movie making scene guys. Watch your 6.
1:25 easy. You shoot it in 5 days.
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Not gonna lie bad films are a true joy when it’s purposefully terrible
I didn't even notice until you guys pointed out it to Wren!
This is so full of cringe, it's hard to watch 😢
What are the chances that the name Bad CGI Gator was changed from something else after the CGI work was done? Maybe they didn’t set out to make bad CGI from the start? This would explain why some shots have a decent amount of effort put in. I have no idea what the truth is, just a thought.
You guys should look at a Canadian CGI cartoon called "reboot". It's not bad it's just early
Check out the movie "9 to 5" there's a shot where the boss's head spins around a few times. I'd love to know how they did it. The other movie to look at is Real Genius. At the end they fill an entire house with popcorn until it cracks and explodes. How did they do that?
The reacts are cool. But I miss more of the crew cuts. Almost a month of nothing but reacts :/
We need for you to react to the Miami mall aliens that appeared at the beginning of the year!
For a really great intentionally bad movie check out Tongan Ninja.
You guys need to get Tommy Wiseau on that couch.
A cgi commercial that was better than the films of the same IP was the dungeons and dragons car commercial.
Its been many days since you reviewed indian movies . Try reviewing  Hanuman vfx
Please do fixing bad VFX episodes. They are my favourite.
Wren is a national treasure, change my mind!
0:30 I noticed that as well
Can you do the review VFX and CGI of Shin Ultraman pls?
I think you guys need to get neil breen on the show to talk about his vfx,!
4:03
Bad cgi is funny
Guys, you shouldn't take sponsorships from betterhelp. They've been known to share their users' data for targeted advertisement purposes, without the user's consent.
They should've hired *pause* real nephews! 😂 ROFL dying..... 🤣🤣
"You are TEARING ME APART, Big Shark!"
That MCU clickbait but it was worth the watch, incredible 😂
Guys you should do a special episode about the trashy movies like Sharknado, Sharktopus and the last one is called Monsternado. Its so bizarre you gonna love it.
Man. The Morongo MCU segment felt like Doctor Who regenerations lmao. In every ad you get a new Doctor to take you through the casino or some shit xD
Wren's reactions are always gold!
I think the Bad Cgi Gator is clipped behind the grass, because within the lore, the characters are also viewing a bad CGI gator. That's part of the horror. We're seeing perfect shots of what the characters are seeing. The grass is just grass, though, which is why it can slightly obstruct the view to the feet.
That Morongo commercial clearly just used the tech from the Black or White music video but not as good
You guys should Review VFX shots from swedens FIRST and ONLY BLOCKBUSTER - The Unthinkable that would be a treat!
I know a guy like Neil Breen. I edited a lockdown "video call" feature film: "Vertrou Niemand" (Afrikaans) And the acting was horrible, everything was shot on phones and sent to me over WhatsApp and they were like "okay go, make a movie". I made a about R1000 ($50) for three months work as the only post production person. It's free on YouTube and there's a VFX gun shot scene at 1:13:17 if you'd like to roast me.
I had the same reaction looking at "the flash" in theater.  I though that the weird CGI design was a real artistic choice.
You guys should stop accepting BetterHelp sponsorships after what they have allegedly done. But the video was great as always
Damn, this was SO painful to watch. I've never felt so cringe on ANY other of your videos, guys. Damn...
Real nephews! ➰🤣 The bad gator one is exactly how I feel when I see supposed kid's drawings in movies; they almost never look like kid's drawings. Because you can immediately see the skill of the artist who made it. Probably mostly to still quickly and definitely communicate the point of the drawing. It bugs me though 😊
was that the actor for john marston doing the voice over for the casino add ?
Can you guys check out the movie The Running Man and do a breakdown of that. Thanks
If you guys enjoy good bad, watch Garth Marenghi's Darkplace. It's a British comedy show about a 70s Horror series. It's a masterpiece
Check out BAD CGI SHARKS, I made the  very bad cgi for that movie
I said it before, and I'll say it again. The movie The VelociPastor is gold when it comes to cringie SFX, but the best moment by far is the CGI fire on the car in the opening scene.
Betterhelp is a scam dont use it
is Morango the worst name for a casino, no the worst name for a company ever?
Why is the guy on our left touching himself at 13:12
You guys should react to the VFX on the series Supernatural.
So Tommy Wiseau saw Family Guy, the episode where Peter pitches the movie "Big Jaws", and decided to rip off the title XD
Anyone ever see Monsturd? It’s terrible but awesome, lots of bad stuff in it
Please, please, please can you take a look at the heaven and hell sequences from the 1995 Geoff Goldblum movie "Hideaway"? They're a real CGI 'treat' 😉
This episode broke Sam 😂 the real mcu 😂 what an episode ❤️
Please, have a go at  "Return to Oz" 1985....there are truly amazing effects in there. Particulary the stone faces.
Time and space was a little wonky with this one.
I'm getting no notifications at all
I think Grum unlocked a childhood nightmare in Wren, that was a very uncomfortable face 😂😂😂
What you want is a contest where each crew member makes a couple of bad vfx shots and then you mix in a load of genuine bad shots from movies. Then get people to call out which ones come from crew members and which ones are genuine. Last crew member standing wins. There’s an art to genuine but bad vfx.
I will never forget the day I heard someone describe Neil Breen as "free and pure." 🤣
So we finally have Mystique in the real MCU, that's cool. A lot of people were waiting for some more mutants to show up in the MCU, so....here you go! 😅
Wren just stops reacting lol
I... Actually couldn't tell... Did you guys think those commercials were bad, or good cgi? Obviously it wasn't super level for a AAA film, but considering we just came from gatorville I'm curious if you think that's a local casino worthy budget CGI!   Other than that, good god please keep doing these forever. I've loved all the content you guys have pretty much ever put out, but these stand out with the way they touch critics and new filmmakers alike as well. Pure greatness!
4:26 Better help, more like Better not help.
Thank you!!! These stupid Morongo commercials play every commercial break for lakers games… they’re somehow worse than the team…
Please do the Michael Jackson Ghosts Video
You should do a nephews competition! Each corridor member gets a nephew and has 2 hours to do something! It would be INCREDIBLE
Fairbanks Alaska University Hockey team intro’s are amazing.  Their students so I get not to rip on them and there’s some quality bits but they lean into the absurd.
i would’ve died if this video was titled “VFX” with no context
These made my head hurt. I honestly believe that I could do better.... and I've never even done ANY VFX in my life.
You guys really need to get Neil Breen on the couch.
Nobody but Tomy would call himself a "visionary director".
Lol you guys did Neil Breen?! Fateful Findings cracks me the f*ck up 😆
not bad, but do birchpunk
I dont think you’ve ever covered the unnecessary cgi gun being thrown on the ground in the first ep of the Halo show. Bad physics, and also could have just thrown a prop gun onto the real ground. Truly baffling
Who killed Captain Alex for the next one of these best CGI hands down
The Pillgrum interviewer also had a supporting role in the movie, Role Models. HILARIOUS STUFF!
Guy please take a look at Upload S3. The VFX shots are so bad ahah
Man I remember seeing the first Big Shark trailer a few years back. Didn't think Tommy would actually finish the film but here it was in 2023.
Hey guys, please make your own low-budget horror movie. But CGI quality declines with every scene. Like opening scene is very well made but the end of the movie is absolute worst
I miss the vlogs😕 but I love your guys content anyway
review adipurush flim from india
Guys don’t accept a sponsorship from better help. They sold therapy data and questionnaire data with questions like ‘have you thought about suicide’ to Amazon which then would try and sell you anti depressants.
Thank you for doing the Morongo commercial. I remember seeing it on TV and thinking "...somebody approved this and paid for it" 🤢
Business idea: real nephews video editing
Please react to the movie "100 Million BC" it's a must watch the worst effects and CGI.
If you haven't done The Amazing Bulk yet please do I'm sure you have but that's a bad cgi masterclass also just a whole episode going over Tim and Eric effects would be hilarious...
What when is the Christmas video
End fight in the immortals please! Vfx or stuntman
1:19 - While Piranha 3D deserves its cheesy crown and would wear it with pride, I resent it being shown alongside movies with low effort/super cheap CG.
We need a separate video of Niko reacting to these clips
3:11 made me spit my milk everywhere.. lmao
I wonder if the Morongo casino ones are a loop they have playing on a screen 24/7 or as a screensaver in the lobby.
Not Ma-rain-go. Mo-wrong-o is how you say it guys.
this is my least fav ever. all bad cgi, not what i want to watch.
I saw the second MCU commercial while my dad was watching tv a couple of weeks ago and thought I was going insane
Can you please do battleship. Such a badly rated movie w perfect CGI. Thanks 😃
Since The Toxic Avenger is getting rebooted, you need to do an episode on Troma Films. Sgt. Kabukiman, Tromeo & Juliet, there's so many "can't tell if intentionally bad" movies to choose from! You leave Cannibal!: The Musical alone though! Without  that we wouldn't have South Park.
This was a great first VFX episode
which film do they  watch in the extended version?
One of the funniest episodes
they should react to the cgo beaver talking in chinese , that video is so emotional i cant even understand what he saying
6:04 Oh! Hi Hai!  hai being the german word for shark. now imagine a japanese person saying that.
Covering twisted pair by neil brine is the best thing you guys thought of ... Just do a watch over of that thing....
Please watch the incredible bulk
12:14 I think you just came up with the title for Neil Breen’s next feature film
This episode was so disturbing
You guys should analyze the emotional chinese beaver video meme
Can you guys look at the CGI for: A Sound of Thunder , Freddy vs. Jason (especially the weed-smoking caterpillar), the children in 2005's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory , the last Hobbit movie, Avengers: Age of Ultron (especially the Iron Man scenes), and the Star Wars special editions?
"Are you a shape-shifter? Morongo Casino-Resort is for you!"
Watch NYAD - seriously some of the most photo real water VFX ever!
Hey, please for pete's sake don't take betterhelp for a sponsor, they're a really scummy company, and I don't think you want it for people seeking mental help.
You guys should react to Garth Marengi’s dark place that’s probably my favourite good bad piece of media
The Morongo ads always crack me up
In the next episode of Bad CGI, y'all should implement some intentionally bad CGI in _your_ end of the filming... film on a green screen, place yourselves on the couch digitally, randomly swap places (but don't swap the shadows), etc.
honestly the Morango ones don't actually look that bad for casino ads
Would love to figure out how to key something transparent on a greenscreen
4:36 who is this guy?! Never seen him before here
i love that you finally talked about my boy neil breen i LOVE him
Yall should do G-Force (the guinea pig one) terrible movie, surprisingly good vfx at times lol
Bloopers make things better, thank you for keeping it in.
I have to say, props to the casino marketing team lol
Has "The Velocipastor" been covered?
Did you guys and gals react to all the special effects in the movie "San Andreas"?
Neil Breen's effects remind me a lot of the 90s. Things like Earth:Final Conflict, Animorphs and Alex Mack. Yes, they had good things for the time, but some shots were exactly this with the green screen over static background or cheesy fade-transition moves across a screen. It's almost nostalgic for the TV days when the remote was too far to reach.
You should look at  "Glenn, the flying robot", a flying robot with police flashing light, that turn evil Ps: I was one the two digital compositor on it, that was my first job after school. Pps: I hide Derrick somewhere in the movie could you find him?
Jellyfish ufo/uap... I dare ya
once you go breen you can never go back
Check out Garth Marenghi's Darkplace!
as you went into adult swim animations, another good 'bad' animation on there was xavier renegade angel
You should have a look at "Scavengers Reign" !!!
The Morongo commercial airs during Dodger games all the time. My mom, who doesn’t care about VFX at all, brought it to my attention.
Yall need to get some of the guys from Mainframe Entertainment on the show! They did Reboot, Beast Wars, Shadow Raiders and others.
I could't make it past the intro. The host is a little too.. youtubey?
"Is this the last one?"  "No! It's not!"
They need to watch The Amazing Bulk
there is nothing wrong with the casino commercial -- it totally succeeds with its mission -- the casino is for EVERYONE
PLease react to the CREATOR movie
are these not good morphs??????????????
*If Tommy Wiseau is trying to be a [less talented] Roger Corman, I'll allow it.*
think about the nephews!!!
Guys…he was a real, physical, living, breathing and dare I say loving gator…he just happens to actually resemble a bad CGI render!
Love this ep!😅  Btw have you ever done Final fantasy advent children? It's a great movie with good and bad cgi
Cowboys vs. Dinosaurs is the best bad CGI out there. Especially the ending scene.
Bold stance advocating in favor of child labor
The morphs weren't as bad as the name.  Fancy making a Casino and give it a name that literally says 'Morons Go Here'!!
Want to see funny bad vfx have a look at movie Llamageddon
The corridor crew should react to Doctor Who regenerations because Because some of them have surprisingly bad vfx
I actually got to see big shark at its Chicago premiere with Tommy in person and pretty great for midnight showing movie.
The Morongo skinwalkers dude lmao
Because some of them are surprisingly bad
Do a reaction of all Doctor Who doctors regenerating
If you want some intentional bad CGI, react to Mondomedia World Doctors
i am so glad someone finally gave time and eric the regoc they deserve
NCIS Sydney has had some pretty bad CGI. The Swans in the UK Ghosts in episode 2 or 3 are aaaawwewful
you guys are stepping on all the “space ace” videos on Neil Breen.. the mega block buster hit movie…. The worst Neil breen is the love scenes and the crap he does in the movie where he tries to come across as an alien….or angel…or whatever he is supposed to be.
Saw this commercial live when it first aired. Always thought it would be hilarious if you guys talked about it 😂 well played
It's a Bad (CGI Gator), not a (Bad CGI) Gator.  Phrasing is everything. 🤣
“This has style to it” instantly stunned into silence
The bad CGI gator really makes me want to see a character in the next Deadpool movie that is In-Universe low poly bad CGI, from another dimension.
Episode idea: Bad and great CGI of commercials. Geico Gecko, the general. Etc
14:13 is this the new Doctor Who?
"Bad CGI Gator 2"? Please. WORSE CGI GATOR and then of course WORST CGI GATOR WITH A VENGEANCE, to round out the trilogy.
15:25  Dating in 2024 be like:
Man, these were shit. I mean , i don't watch do-bad-they're-good movies for a reason! Lol yeah they're funny, but I won't watch them in full.
I thought Grum was Gather's Pond...
7:37 HOW HAVE YOU GUYS NEVER ONCE HAD ANYONE (especially Erin and Jason) FROM SO BAD IT'S GOOD ON THIS GOD-FORSAKEN CHANNEL?!?!?  Seriously, if you guys want to get an opinion and some WILD clips on the channel, PLEEEEEEASE get Jason and/or Erin Brant on the (casting) couch!  I would re-join your silly membership thing for a year if SBIG was on here...
I LOVE CRACKERS AND SNACKS, CRACKERS AND SNACKS! GRUM IS A LEGEND!
vfx artists react with jordan are the best videos
Corridor crew please check out Gaither's Pond. I promise you'll love it.
Now do a video with nephews doing cgi to fake script 😂
7:59 This part killed me. XD
Watch the 2012 The Thing prequel!!
Ive been waiting for you guys to do the Morongo commercials! lmao too great.
4:36- You and I have the same goals, my brother from another mother. I've bene laying all my life- over 35 years- but I signed up for some classes, I'm self-taught- and it shocked me how much my playing improved already. Learning arpeggios and how to turn scales and chords into arpeggios and then reverse engineer them back into chords and scales- was a huge breakthrough for me. It allows you to play over changes instead of just hanging out in a scale and it forces you to really get to know the neck- every note, without taking time to work it out.  Idk who you're working with, but Rick Beato and Tim Pierce have both been a huge help to me- they're amazing teachers.
Next time one of these comes around, give ‘Lockhart: Unleashing the Talisman’ a watch. It’ll fit right in lol
Forced trash is the worse genre to have ever existed. Why spent money on something that is supposed to be bad? We can watch thousands of trashmovies for free and they deliver. Forced trash is on the same level as putting gold on your icecream. It makes it more expensive, but not any better. Never understood why people are into it.
Is it a “Bad-CGI” Gator *or* a Bad “CGI Gator”? Maybe it’s a bad gator, made of CGI? 😅
i'm prety sure at this point that the facemorphs are what people saw when evoking demons
If you want a funny opening that has some of the worst CGI I have ever seen check out "Jurassic Shark 2: Aquapocalypse"
mean
REACT TO THIS    BOLLYWOOD REACTS, PATHAAN ANOTHER SRK MOVIE AND AYALAAN
Imagine my disappointment when I double check the name of the video and it still says VFX artists react. 😢
Do The Curse finale, that floating effect has more than it meets the eye.
Clicked off the video in the first 3 seconds for the host shouting at the viewer.
I grew up where Morongo Casino Resort is, and that commercial DOES NOT surprise me at all. You should review a bunch of super rural/localized commercials.
I absolutely loved the amount of mental brick walls Wren went through in this video 😂😂  Wrens a fantastic human being
Love watching Sam laughing and loosing his mind
Thanks to the Steven Seagal-John Wick film you guys did, I discovered (and got hooked on) Space Ice's channel. He introduced me to Neil Breen, who I was pleasantly surprised to see here. Thanks so much. Also, with each video I watch, I'm amazed at how bad Seagal's films are. Just...bad.
If ever you do another bollywood vfx react video, PLEASE check out Adipurush. On top of being the worst movie i think i've ever seen (as bad as the Avatar live action movie), its vfx were some of the worst i've seen in a movie made in the last 20 years. I can't even name a specific part of it, because it's just consistently terrible. PLEASE check it out. You will not be disappointed.
Decent is being a bit too kind.  You don't have to mess up _everything_ for it to be bad.  I think the fun of it is watching the mix and match of bad and _almost._
Neil Breen is the Leonardo Davinci of our era! He does it all!
My submission for cringey cgi is the drywall punch scene in The Brothers Sun episode 1
15:14 that's a GIF meme for 2024
The Grum reminds me of the Globglogabgalab.
Can you do a VFX reacts to batinthesun?
They made it a loop so it could play constantly outside the casino.
I would like to recommend you look into some music videos.  There are some amazing visual effects out there for everyone to be amazed.  Check out the amazing videos by Michel Gondry.  For Example: Kylie Minogue's - Come into my World.
Those casino commercials were still better than Secret Invasion  Edit: Nevermind, you kinda made the same joke lol
Would love a VFX and/or Stuntman reacts for Hardcore Henry.
I cant unsee these things '-'
I've been waiting so long for Neil Breen to pop up on this channel 😂😂😂
I actually learn heaps from these videos of bad VFX. Also the alien and ghost debunking.
Watch movie ( ayalaan)
would love for you guys to check out the work of nobuhiko obayashi (from house, to his late career)   effects that lean heavily into the artifice and disobey reality, but in a way that makes it beautiful
Hi I'm from tamilnadu please watch movie ayalaan the Tamil movie
Sam's face when he's laughing is so funny, it always makes me laugh everytime. It's so infectious lol
We need more Morongo Casino Universe
You missed the chance to have the bad morph closing shot!
I love this jank edition. Do it again.
I'd like to see a review of "To the Ends of Time"'s effects
Big shark is everything you could have dreamed of and more. Scenes are out of order. Scenes are repeated. The first shark sighting is in a boxing ring… told in flashback… by a guy who Dosent believe in the shark… but was there to witness it. Cinema
No nephews were harmed on the production of this video.
Seen a few comments, so just +1ing the idea of you guys doing some Doctor Who. Would love to see a breakdown of the recent "Wild Blue Yonder" (2023) and "The Giggle" (2023). Some very silly, occasionally great VFX shots.
No mention of BIRDEMIC?? Yall are missing out!
Now I want CC to produce "Bad practical effects Gator" and pitch it to Vessi.
Have they done "The Mystical Adventures Of Billy Owens"? I think it and it's sequel have some vfx shops...and is widely seen as bad bad.
Please react to Blink 182, music video ALWAYS is Crazy!!!!!
Neil Breen scares me. Those movies of his are nightmare fuel.
Hey I'm the shapeshifter from the MCU, can confirm was a green screen.
Did I miss the yearly holiday gift exchange video? One of my favorite videos the crew does
I just realized Jordan totally got me in the beginning saying they were going to look at the MCU. I thought it was a scene from one of the many MCU shows I haven't seen.
PLease Cover the HTTYD franchise!
Challenge idea: compete to make the jankiest cgi
The REAL MCU
Fellas you should start a project where people pay a $2 donation to vote on the theme of a short film that you will develop USING ONLY REAL NEPHEWS! Crowdfunded lift of the next generation, you get lots of views win win win!  Do it
2012 ice age best vfx in filmmaking 😮
Please do a comparison between Star Trek: Deep Space Nine and Babylon 5. Both from a similar era, both starting to dabble in CGI, to radically different results.
I love that you guys found that gem on Tim and Eric 😂 I love that show
I'd love to see you revise "Color out of Space", great movie, an over-the-top Nick Cage in a Lovecraftian horror with some (I believe) practica effects. What else could you want?
I love this series, but something about the pacing of this episode felt.....off?
You guys should have checked out the Shrek: Retold movie. The graphics are absolutely ridiculous.
This might not be the greatest suggestion but my kids watch this show called Gumball and they use all sorts of animation techniques and i was wondering what professionals think of the show
VERY DISAPPOINTED in y'all. PLEASE STOP SUPPORTING BETTERHELP! FFS they allegedly sell private healthcare data. And so many other things. You're selling out your audience by partnering with them.   Check out mickey Atkins "why I'll never take a sponsorship from betterhelp" and BJ investigates "let's talk about betterhelp"
We still need to talk about how Detective Spooner's gun strap hooked itself through a metal bar near the end of iRobot. They didn't need to show it, but they focused on it, even though the gun never comes into play again.
Hey corridor, I don't think you should really be connected to better help, they're in kind of a situation where they sell your personal data and in a lawsuit. Might be best to skip the sponsorship from them.
Am am once again asking for the final scene of Sons of Anarchy, it's your dream episode
I worked on a commercial for a casino a few years ago. I'm happy to say it came out better than this.
Grum's not wrong.  Crackers and snacks are pretty dope.
I'm so happy to see a Redlettermedia/corridor crossover hahaha. Breen is a legend. Tommy was a one hit wonder and the room is just lame now, but Neil breen has been on a completely un self aware hot streak
Hello, I was wondering if you guys could feature a show going over how they did the special effects in movie such as Samson and Delilah in 1948, Ben Hur, the 10 Commandments, etc. around the time where Cecil B DeMille was making his movies.
You guys should react to clips from those old “monster” movies like:  Sharknado Sharktopus Super Shark Dinocroc vs Supergator Sand Sharks
My only question: Why was that girl out in the yard taking her top off at NIGHT? 🤣 Was she "moon bathing?" 😂😂  I guess I have to watch the movie to find out. But let's be real, that's NEVER going to happen.
The "MCU" campaign actually isn't bad in concept -- it's the execution that made it hilariously bad. It definitely needed better morph FX and staging, like the Michael Jackson "Black or White" music vid.
The moment when Wren discovers the "Magic" of Neil Breen, lmao.
The peter gabriel music video for "Steam" has some janky ass CGI in it. It cracks me up every time.
wish we'd fix the audio levels of these videos, it's always way to loud, especially at the beginning with Wren shouting
Didn’t better help get sued for stealing n selling their customers data to big companies to sell super personalized ads
They should really look at the lion from jumanji
If yall are gonna talk about Grum you've GOTTA talk about Xavier Renegade Angel
i think you'd enjoy taking a look at Banshee S2E9 around 05:10, there's this "incredible" car crash not to be missed.
giving my boy Grum some attention! respect
I never realised what a ringer Wren is for Neil Breen before. Almost like a nephew.
That bad GCI gator is a really interesting one because it's very clearly the artists riding a very careful line of fulfilling the brief while also adding in enough competency there that they can say "hey I did the DOF or compositing on Bad CGI Gator" and it's actually a decent piece to put in your showreel lmao.
Morongo Casinos! "You're a moron if you go!"
Today is a Big Day with a Big Shark on the very first episode of VFX.
I can't believe you're just now discovering the real human Breen?!?
I miss these posts. I need more!
Absolutely shocking to see a casino local to me in a Corridor video. Great work as always!
Thank you, thank you, thank you! That Morongo Casino commercial makes me cringe. I make the same sound every time I see the hot woman morph into an old guy.
I loved the Casnio one! For a simple commercial, the morphing was fun.
Don’t Hug Me I’m Scared
Where Xavier Renegade Angel?
You guys kept saying “Comped in” and I thought you guys should have a “straight outta Comped in” t shirt lol  Vfx joke shirt
Bad VFX, my goodness. Neil Breen will be so excited he gets attention.  Land Shark on Amazon Prime really did me on awful cgi/practical effects.  Love the work boys  Bad acting makes bad cgi better.
Looking at the first few seconds of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League gameplay, would you guys do Animators react to good and bad Video Game animation? something about Harley Quinn's acrobatics feels floaty and ungrounded - and I'd love insight into how you can strike that balance between weighty and believable animation and responsiveness for gameplay.
I’m so glad they went through the Morongo commercials. I’ve had that same reactions whenever that commercial would come on screen lol
It's like multiple artists animated on literally different parts of the gator but none of them agreed how the gator should be like so it ended up messy like the exquisite corpse game. Some wanted to put a little more decent effort as making it more visually authentic makes it more hilarious with the contrasting tones but others just wanted to goof off with some good old low shitposting quality for lulz. This could happen if severe "creative differences" never dissolves.
Sam said anything. Anything???   @giga9139 @zen745    youtube clips
How many times did y'all break Wren during this episode!!!???
_We need to have a Corridor Crew and RedLetterMedia crossover episode._
the effects in cronenberg’s dead ringers are worth a look.
What about doing the suicide room game sequence reaction, i thought that there were some interesting artistic desicions...
Tom Kenny is Grum
On bad gator, the first shot analyzed, what makes it actually work is the sound effects of its stubby walking. It just works.
Hey dudes and dudettes, concerning the casino morph: it gave me a throwback to the terminator morph episode, where we were told the first morph experiments were not morph from A to B, but morph from A to intermediate AB and than morph from there to B. I can’t really put my finger on it but I feel like they had an intermittent step in the morphing. I’d love to hear your opinion on that - is it just me or do you get the same vibe?
I can't tolerate watching really bad movies without having 3 guys making fun of it. [Cough] Mystery science theater [cough]
The good, the bad and the ugly VFX!
I just love Wren
You guys should do a video of ultra realistic morphs.  Like it's gotta hurt having your bones do that.  Where do the glasses come from/go??
6:45 the flooding animation seems to be played backwards though?
I would love if you had some of the people who make these kinds of things on the couch
There's another movie similar, but the VFX are so terrible that it plays tongue and cheek at it. The movie's called Velocipastor.
Love how pixelated the Godzilla VS Kong image was.
Primal 2019 opening scene with the leopard... looks suuuper jank
"real nephews" killed me
Tip for a future episode of VFX artists react: A bad shark movie with surprisingly decent VFX "RoboShark".  I'm sorry I can't include a clip, but Youtube already removed two of my previous comments that included links to other Youtube videos, saying it went against their guidelines and threatened to remove my account if I did it again. 🤷‍♂
...are you pronouncing the casino name correctly? "Moron Go" seems more likely based on their ad
Would like to see you guys look at medical CGI from the TV show House.
4:38 Clean that fretboard!
Officially Day 006: of asking for you to react to "Enter The Void" (2009), "A Scanner Darkly", "Waking Life", and "Undone" (2019 TV series)
It'd be cool to see you guys react to some scenes from the live action Yu Yu Hakusho show
There's a teaser for the series Legion called  ''Legion | Season 2: Amorphous Preview | FX'' and it includes morphing VFX in a really cool way, you should check it out.
How had I not heard of Big Shark yet. Holy cow.
16:27 she picks up the glass and its still there too lol
Funny reviews, but here's the next challenge: Say "Morongo" correctly LOL
Please guys, you should see a Brazilian commercial for a soda company called ''Dollynho'', probably will have at least an entire video just with those animations! Love from Brazil <3
Please react to Reacher season 1 ep 7 about 4:00 min in at the funeral. There are some people comped in poorly. Really like the show tho
Morongo more like morph-wrong-o
You should react to The Amazing Bulk.
Love the MCU morphing grunts, like it doesn't really hurts to transform but it's still very uncomfortable, like having your stomach and lungs changing size and forcing or taking gas from the outside.
MORONGO MOPROBLEMS
Bro this episode is 😂😂😂😂
Interesting fact: BetterHelp was caught selling data to Facebook, Snapchat, Criteo, and Pinterest. The company recently settled for $7.8 million. Fun stuff.
My 6yo daughter says “Love your videos!❤”
When Sam slam DUNKED the Jurassic World directors.... i fucking screamed like an ape bc of how much i agree lol
Where's secret santa?
Grum reminds me of the Mucinex mucus man. If you’re looking at good-bad commercial vfx, that’s one for the submission box.
Nemesis 3 and 4 the trailers tells you how bad it is, I'm sure there's a story behind those movies.
I refuse to think bad CGI is funny.
You guys should watch the Dolly Guaraná commercials, a soda from Brazil, also the Barriguinha Mole one
You should make nephews challenge! 😂
Honestly, for bad movies.. Uwe Boll can't be beat
Neil Breen. The master of storytelling. He's just too good for you mortals to understand. Please watch the beautiful homage clips by Space Ice, a true fan of his work.
At the end there, they're Straight Outta Compton.
Neil Breen is a legend. I have had many movie nights heckling his movies with my friends over the years.
PLS I just NEED more of this
More episodes like this please.
You guys need to react to Kung Fury
Please look at the movie Trolland. I couldnt make it through it
BetterHelp was selling private data to companies, so for example if you were an alcoholic, you would get targeted ads trying to sell you alcohol... look it up...
have you done a deep dive on the Michael Jackson video black or white? the morphs are amazing considering the technology they had available.
Omg no not you guys too..  better help sponsorship = unsubscribe 😢👎👎😭😭😭
"Old" point and click adventure game? Oh sir, those games are still being made, and they are quite successful. So many anime games, so many daddy games.
Um, your sponsor is BetterHelp. Isn't that the company that sold super confidential customer information to ad agencies, even life threatening conditions, to target people to sell them stuff?????
"There's style to thi-" >dead silence  Got a good chuckle from that, thanks Wren 😂
I'm glad you guys covered Neil Breen. He's a special man
I have wanted to recommend a video with TERRIBLE CGI but I cannot for the life of me find out what it is called. I saw some of it when a patient of mine was watching it in their room. It was on the Spanish channel and was a Western. There was a slow motion bullet scene that was absolutely hilarious.
Big Shark is kinda like sharknado
Please review Lost In Space from the 90s, particularly Spider Smith
I haven’t even watched the video yet but just a heads up someone put the wrong thumbnail up. Grum, the incredible vision of director Glenn Tennis, is one of the finest pieces of character design and creation seen in the last 20 years. Just thinking about Grum makes me hungry for crackers and snacks.
Did Sam call Wren an asshole at 15:52?? "Because he was probably there, asshole."
Check out FDR American Badass
Guys, during Daredevil and Echo fight scene in the new show, there is a weird ass moment where Daredevil like morphs from a CG model after getting knocked down and it looks super jenk and you guys should look at it
DO MUSIC VIDEOS!!!
5:55 is that... Mortal Kombat 3's font? lol
The last one reminds me of the morphing in Michael Jackson - Black Or White, but it's a lot better
Dudes, you have to see a meme in Brazil, a character in a series of commercials called Dolinho, mascot of a soda called Dolly
Gnaw Food of the Gods II. Terrible movie but some cool vfx.
Hey you leave Grum alone
Man, what happened to this channel? Why are you guys laughing hysterically at things that are not funny? Is there a gas leak in your studio? And the incessant mugging for the camera? I call it "YouTube burnout" - the general lowering of quality from too much quantity. Running out of ideas. So you sit and mug at the camera and laugh at things that are not funny.
Have you done Bruce Almighty yet?
do Animorphs
Wren really needs to tone it down. His shtick is getting annoying, especially with the intros.
Yo, jokes aside, get your nephews and childeren to the couch,  let them judge CGI (you guys are experts in the field, but how would childeren react to CGI for shows made for them)
Would be interested to see your guys' thoughts on the film Kooky. It's fairly obscure and has a very interesting visual style.
why is Corridor still taking sponsorships from BetterHelp, don't they know that they sold over half of their mentally unstable clients data? oh and also lie about the Therapist being professional when anyone and their grandma can just sign up as one........  It truly stings when you see your favorite creators be such sellouts like that, at least you do know who is and isn't now tho
next time pls dont make all those vomitiing noises it's gross, grating, and annoying
Please have a look at the new world of warcraft trailer!
It feels like an eternity between videos when there isn't a behind the scenes making of videos during the week.
Idea! Y'all should look at the 1994 show ReBoot! It's the first ever 30 minute CG cartoon that aired on ABC Kids and YTV in Canada. It was made by Mainframe entertainment (now Rainmaker) and they also made Beast Wars and Shadow Raiders!  The graphics look very polygonal and stiff now but was pretty mindblowing at the time! The graphics improved a lot with season 3.   Fans like me would love to have you guys take a look at the show to see how CGI for TV first started out compared to what they look like now.
This just makes me want to see "Morphin' Corridor Universe" where you have a competition between members of the crew to come up with parodies of the Morongo spots.
Slither 2006 please
seing niel breem outside of RLM is a suprise.
Corridor x Neil Breen: the intersection the world so sorely needs
So we've arrived at Neil Breen? 🤣
15 : 47 Compton.
15:15 they missed the perfect opportunity to do a morph from Ren to Sam reactions.
For the Alligator movie they probably paid real artists who unfortunately were not good enough and mixed it with a few super janky shots
Wren got a little traumatized recording this episode
Question: are the singing pints of Guinness real or CGI?
“I didn’t expect to get so deep in this, I’m happy” 😭😭😭
6:47 - The edges of the water seem to be flowing backwards to my eyes, with splashes pulling into the main flow.
Inconsistent cgi gator looks pretty decent
"Real Nephews" that landed so good there has to be a massive amount of truth to it
Straight Outta Comped-In
You guys should take a look at the Narnia movies. There are some crazy effects in there. Especially in the third, witht he morphing faces and the water/dry effects in the bedroom.
Hey guys, would love to see you're reaction to Society of the Snow's plane crash and compare it to the crash from 1993's Alive which is based on the same story.
Can anybody help me: what’s the clip at 0:17 from? I remember finding it hilarious when I first saw it but I don’t remember where I saw it. Thanks!
Now I would like to see 'Lexx' get some love...cheers.
please more
Tommy Wiseau and Neil Breen, two of the greatest Black Tank Top directors of all time in one bad CGI video? Very cool!
React to Nollywood (Nigerian Hollywood) VFX scenes
What about the nieces …
Finally, Mystique enters the MCU.
Please watch the Sylvester Stallone chaos pen promo.
that was cool, but enough, thx. i'd rather watch more lift, than cheap shots for laughs. :)
This episode made me laugh so much. Thank you.
Who cares about the MCU when Neil Breen is creating his own cinematic universe?! 😂
please let Jeff Lew have a seat on this couch. ( he created the entire Killer Bean universe by himself). he is truly inspiring and has a lot to tell
I want to go to Morongo Casino and Resort so that I can become someone else.
I just heard about this "jellyfish ufo" can't wait to see a breakdown on that! 👍
Want some "interesting" morphs?  The Babylon 5 DVD Menu Screen.
did you check out Xavier Renegade Angel, by now?
"YOU'RE TEARING ME APART BIG SHARK"!
Is it just me, or the water flowing up the street at 6:45 - is it flowing backwards, as in the footage is reversed??
Grum was easily the best one.
You’re behind Red Letter Media by years with talking about Neil Breen. Glad a different moviemaking perspective is being discussed though.
MCU morphs reminded me about Buffy and Charmed. It's almost nostalgic.
BREEEEEEEEN
Let’s be honest,  Bad CGI Gator was called Bad Gator until they realised it wasn’t good enough to be a good film. Just like all the Sharknado sequels where they pretended it was a joke all along.
Those Morongo Casino ads are for a tribal casino near Palm Springs. They play in literally every local Lakers game telecast. I’ve been thinking about this bad morphs for years!  Cool bonus: they let 18 year olds gamble there.
Oh my , neil breen is the goat😂
You should definitely check out the brazilian TV soap opera "Mutantes - caminhos do coração", it's full of terrible CGI lol
After all these years, how are people NOT subscribed to this channel?
Isn't better help selling data of people's problems so they will have ads connected to their issues?
Ahhh Morongo, the very first casino I ever went to. I remember those commercials well
Theres an insanely bad CGI comercial in brazil, the name is DOLLY, reccomend you guys watch it and avaliate it
Challenge idea: give people a very difficult task with very limited time so you know they'll have to cut corners, then rank them by how BAD it was, worst ofc winning.
i see Grum, i click.
EYES ON BREEN!!!
I can honestly say that thanks to Wren having to do mental parkour over these clips, I'll call it the best VFX artists react  (or best VFX overall) of 2024 so far!
Bad as in naughty, guys. Come on.
The noise they keep making every time there’s a morph/transition in the casino MCU commercials almost made me choke on my food from laughing so hard! Like they are powering up or taking a dump! Urrrrrrrrghhah! 😂🤣
Clicked instantly because of Grum
The morph from the black lady to the white lady was actually pretty good. The blurred background just made it odd
Why would anyone agree to take money from Better Help after all that's come out? It's just weird now
Better help sponsor... 😡 Trash company, that is really bad for people and has a worse than checkered history. Boooo 👎
that last one im like.. ya that just creeps me out.
I think you haven't reacted to Xavier Renegade Angel and Ratboy Genius yet. Great shows.
Stop shouting Wren
I'd really like a Video about Rango. There is something that makes this movie super beautiful
Silent Night 2023 <--- Amazing cinematography, stunts and long cuts Hellboy 2019 <--- Some pretty impressive vfx but also, a few got rushed way to fast. Atomic Blond 2017 <--- Awesome practical effects. RIPD 2013 <--- Some cool but also some VERY janky CGI. Immortals 2011 <--- Amazing slow motion effects, like mind blowing effects Mortal Kombat 1995 <--- Janky af vfx but pretty good fight scenes and stunts. The Mask Of Zorro 1998 and The Legend of Zorro 2005  <--- Awesome special effects and some nasty stunts. Final destination 1 and 2, forget the rest of them.
I so badly want to see your crew redo Ed Wood visual effects!!!
Wait a minute, they named their casinos "Moron Go?" Hidden message?
I grew up 30 minutes from Casino Morongo and have seen that commercial a thousand times. Thank you for the nostalgia.
If it doesn't get you in copyright related troubles, I would really like to see an episode about visual effects used in Micheal Jackson's music videos, specially the ghosts short film. I think his music videos were very innovative for the time and paved the way to what we now know as music videos.
Neil Breen is my lord and savior!
The people shown on the casino in the credits are the people used in all of them
Y’all should do a vid on African films’ CGI
Can you guys do a breakdown video of the ufo jellyfish?! Thanks! Fantastic vids!
MANDELBAUM MANDELBAUM MANDELBAUM!!
this was a great episode! the face expressions were HILARIOUS
I’d love to see you react to the sci-fi cult classic show LEXX
See, with Bad CGI Gator they should've just gone whole hog on it and made it like a PS1 graphics gator, jittering polygons and no anti-aliasing and everything
“Welcome back to visual effects”
‼️ Betterhelp were caught and fined for selling users private medical data! Google “betterhelp selling data”.
I was at a screening of Big Shark last night and im glad you watched the 2nd trailer because everything in that first one is NOT in it lol. but you guys are absolutely right it's a hilariously good time
appreciate the tim + eric style effects this video
That reminds me of Animorphs; if they were run by an ad company.
You know it’s Saturday when Corridor Crew uploads. It’s a strange feeling, but a nice one.
Check out the pootie tang movie
Tommy Wiseau and Neil Breen in one ep LFG
Best episode ever.
Living in the IE I see that commercial all the time 😂
15:41 pov your friends are wondering where N.W.A came from
You know what needs to be done now boys make a bad cgi clip on the main channel haha
I love how broken wren is in this episode. Neil Breen broke him and he never came back.
The casino morph is like Animorphs
I would love to see you guys do an animation episode on Mondo Media's shows, especially World Doctors/Archeologist! Hilarious show with janky 3D animations :)
You guys have new stuffs in kollywood broo😜movie name leo
Nice
I hope these guys make a video about the jellyfish UFO video.
Sam looks so uninterested this whole video.
Please look at the season finale of The Curse (Paramount Plus or Showtime) that just ended!  Would love to know how they did those effects!
Happy to see Glen Tennis getting some recognition.
i cant believe neil breen has finally made an appearance. lets fucking go
Please can you react to the scene in Deadpool 2 when the car crashes into the gas station? It's really out of place and awfully jarring
No no, it's a "bad" as in evil cgi gator
Crappy Comp Croc
Wren was even more upbeat and perky than usual - until that Grum thing showed up and broke his brain. 😮
Bloodshot elevator fight scene truly terrible vfx and its the climax of the movie
Eyes on Breen!
It took me a while to place the voice, but I'm pretty sure the Morongo narrator is the very well regarded drummer, Greg Bisonette
With this one the vfx is actually quite good but it’s what’s happening in the scene that is confusing - Michael Jackson moonwalker final battle scene
You guys should do a whole episode dedicated to Tim&Eric stuff. Such a treasure trove of hilarious effects
Bad CGI Gator... I'm thinking they had different artists with different workflows, and each was cut off before their final stages so we kept getting different flavors of bad.   So first artist matched the light, didn't do a final pass for motion blur. Next artist did masking to end up behind grass but didn't do... I dunno, a pass for shadows. Next guy was just given the wrong context, so ol gator was in the wrong shot... thus, floating.  This actually sounds fun...😄
Better help are scammers and a terrible sponsor. They will sell your information. Check out their lawsuits
10:44 What has this series become
Have you guys done VFX and/or stunmen react to the 95 Mortal Kombat movie?
Better help are awful. Bad sponsor.
Thanks for information
You guys MUST SEE this brazillian commercial! It's called "Dolly Guaraná"
Since we were on the topic of people doing everything by themselves, you had Ian Hubert on before I believe, but I think you've never looked at dynamo dream itself on the show iirc. That would be really cool and I believe there's a ton of other really good creators out there producing quality stuff on their own, it would be cool to have a look at how you can get this good just with a single person or small teams, like the shorts from the Blender Studios. (And yes I know Ian has BTS material himself, but I still believe this could really get another angle on it which could be really cool)
Not okay to have BetterHelp ad, especially after everything that happened....
15:25 is this Hide the pain Harold's son ? the infamous ... Hide the pain Haroldsson ?
Finally corridor crew is beginning to merge with Red Letter Media. Thank you again Neil Breen.  What can't he do?
Surreal entertainment does great “bad” cgi
SHEN YUN!!! PLEEEEASE do Shen Yun!  The digital backdrops for those shows are Windows 95 hilarity!
the flooding in the streets is just an element of waves crashing into shore and then its moving sideways.
“Huuuuuuuuaaaah!”
Thanks guys for another great episode. I think you guys should have a look at Joshua In The Promised Land. I hadn't heard about it until recently as it is a Christian Church funded kids movie : not exactly my usual sort of movie. However, it is maybe the worst CG I've ever seen, and I've seen a LOT of bad movies! Honourable mentions goes to the two Birdemic movies and Despiser.
PLEASE WATCH GAITHERS POND!!!
excellent video
Can you guys please check out THE scene from The Curse 2023 series finale? I can't figure out how they filmed that
On the other hand, maybe you could look at the fantastic CGI in 'Life on Our Planet". I'd love to see what is going on there!
I suspect that gator movie was as serious effort at first, and then they gave up and decided to just pretend "I meant to do that"
Someone at Morongo Casino is a Roseanne fan lol.
Okay, if you post a reaction video to the entirety of Twisted Pair, I'll subscribe to your website. I promise!
Apart from trying to hide transitions I haven't used a morph as a VFX for years. But 25+ years ago they were ubiquitous. The problem was that directors had no idea how to shoot for it. My favourite was when a client arrived with a digitape where he'd filmed a lady in a green dress with long green gloves against a blue screen. She walks into shot holding a glass then puts her gloved fingers in it. The second shot was green liquid being poured into the glass (against blue screen). In the 5 hours the client had booked, he expected to walk away with a shot of a  chrome terminatoresque girl who pours herself into the glass.... That's just one of many, many CGI fail stories.
One of my favorite episodes yet! I have a strange draw towards horrible effects. Probably due to Sir Graves Ghastly but if I find a black and white where I can see wires or crazy camera shots I'm locked in. Pleeeeeez review B grade horror/sci-fi films from the 50's and 60s!!
the morango comercials are burned into my brain from LA Sportsnet Dodgers games
I love it when Jordan's on the couch. He's one of my favourites. (Along with Matt and Fenner, may he rest in peace.)
There's a company called 'Moron Go' ? Talk about on-the-nose...
Please get Eric Wareheim on that couch.
15:47 "I'm right but I can't prove it." Same's energy is just Reddit. "I am the authority of the internet!"
Sorry guys, I could not finish this episode
guys, why you make Neil Breen famous, but you don't ever seen Andrei Badin films. You will like it, I promise. You can do full video about this russian indie-director
i still wonder, how can i contact corridor channel?
"Were you listening to me, Neo? Or were you looking at the woman in the red dress?"
4:11 did Sam just insult my race of armature blender artist? 😂😅
Good god. The Morongo morphs are making me lose my shit at the airport LMAO
Challenge idea: Who can make the best FMV adventure game in a week?   Restraints should be that you can't do something that looks more advanced than what 1990s CDROM Pentium based games could muster. The era where Full Motion Video was horribly compressed half SD resolution MPEG1 with interlaced footage to skip on half the vertical resolution.   Oh and that goes for the CGI and acting as well.
I lost it at the grunting at transitions 😂😂😂
finally proof that the MCU uses VFX appropriation from nephews
More of this pls ❤
Review the movie “leo” chasing scene camera artworks , im still bedazzled with all the camerawork’s
I can make Bad VFX. 😎
I wish yall could look at music videos and their FX especially kpop ones. They are insane! But that being said, it’d probably all be copyright 😞😒🫠😭
I'm fully invested in the Morongo Casino Universe now. I can't wait for their take on the multiverse.
Now we need to see if they can fix the Bad CGI Gator by trying to fix it with their effects, OR make their own "Bad CGI something"... Or fix the Big Shark perhaps?
By the way. The mention of old point and clic full motion video adventures. There's such a gold mine of strangeness there. That is it's own series of videos.   Heck.. I bet you guys can do a challenge. Who can do the best FMV adventure game in a week! And it should be limited to the capabilities of what compositing and CG could do in those glorious 1990s days of having more storage than sense for your games.
Tim and Eric is shit compared to MDE: World Peace
The casino that gives Shallow Hal hallucinations.
I'm currently on a Breaking Bad re-watch and I instantly thought Jordan has an uncanny resemblance to Badger, one of Jessies meth dealing friends we meet in season 2 (especially when he's wearing his beany)
YEAAAAH! YOU DID NEIL BREEN! I've been waiting so long, haha.
Was the narrators' voice from the casino ad Daryl from  Storage Wars? lol
I have seen those morongo commercials  on tv for many months now and I remember how traumatized I was seeing it for the first time 😂 and I just saw it again yesterday and I told myself I need to search the internet and see if other people also had the same reaction and I can’t believe you guys just reacted to it! lol what are the odds! Loved this episode!!
You guys have got to react to Poor Things! The VFX are amazing and super unique
Neil Breen deserves his own whole series of episodes. Heck, you might even be able to score an interview where he can show off his latest film.   Because he's the real human Breen. And the real hero.
Day 7 of asking for the corridor crew to react to Jedi Rocks
I haven’t laughed so hard in a while.
I thought the day would never cone when you guys would react to a neil breen film.
Awesome episode! That Pilgrims character looks like broccoli with a shaved head.
You need to react to the bad sifi movies like Piranhaconda
Think about the nephews!!!
guys, i love you, but please stop with the BetterHellp sponsors. they just recently got found out for selling customers data. and were even in court for it literally last month. they ask you things like if you have had suicidal thoughts and stuff in questionnaires, very personal stuff, and then they went and were selling that data. just look it up. that's not to mention the stuff from 5 years back where they weren't even using professionals. it was even in their TOS that they didn't. they are not a good company, and it reflects badly on you guys that you keep shilling them without actually looking into them. if people need help with mental help, go see an actual doctor, don't use a bloody app, and especially don't use one that sells all your personal info and might not even put you through to a professional. shame on you Corridor. seriously. is the sponsor money really that much more important than a simple google search into what you are shilling? especially when its to do with mental health. what's next? organ transplant app ads? yoou guys stopped shilling the tree plots when it was discovered they were a scam. yet you still do betterhelp despite them literally being outed everywhere as also being a scam. It shouldn't take a Coffeezilla video.
Thank you for covering that commercial! It's so freaky! Also, when the guy blinks(seated at a slot machine) it's completely uncanny valley! I think it's Mystique just wanting to have a good time! 🤣
So weird how the Bad CGI Croc wasn't really that bad... I wonder what happened...
Those Morongo Casino commercials kill me every single time!
Justice for the nephews!
that morongo ad 100% has secret lore and that shapeshifter like eating a machine user in another ad
I clicked off Immediately after him screaming "HEY!!! WHATS UP!!" 🤣...
I think Wren is traumatized
Wow when you said commercial I thought you were gonna show the best Brazilian animation of all time, Dollynho !
I think it'd be interesting to take a normal vfx prompt, translate it through different languages and back to English, and then interpret what you get back
The car explosion in velocipastor is some of the best vfx ive ever seen
Neil Breen for President 2024
Fifth Element, Rollerball, Logan's Run, The Last Starfighter. Do your magic.
the "Hi shark" joke is underrated
I would like to see a challenge where you do the old movie theater intro they play before the start of a movie. Can be worst, best, cringe, whatever kind of challenge you feel like doing. I can provide an example link if needed
Grum was the first example of CGI, invented by the pioneers when they first came to Plymouth. Please don't smear our history like that.
I live like 45 minutes from Morongo and have seen their MCU play out in real time watching local cable TV with my parents. Glad these nightmare morphs are getting started. I can't be the only one traumatized by these. 😂
11:22 Man The MCU has really been going downhill since endgame
I want you to watch this Korean movie gyeongseong creature😊
If you want the absolute best parody of bad movies, the greatest "everything looks bad on purpose" show, you have got to watch Garth Marenghi's Darkplace. It is comedy genius. No CGI, but bad practical effects, bad acting, bad filmmaking in general, and it is done absolutely perfectly! All six episodes are on youtube so there's no excuse, watch it!
You guys need to watch the Dorbees. Its by the same guy who made Gaithers pond. Another legendarily bad cgi show. Its made by Benjy Gaither and the animations were insanely expensive, and were funded by money from his dad who was the leader and songwriter of a super successful christian band. Its an insane story from early cgi and you guys would get a kick out if it.
Yall should do a nephew challenge. Get 5 random kids to make the best short. My nephew would pass out at an opportunity like that.
Well, I learned something today... There are more than 1 anaconda movie.
love the morphs
It's not the tongue, it's the tennis ball clipping through.
Oh man...that's where I have to disagree.  Tim and Eric was so bad, it made me stop watching adult swim completely. And I mean way back when it was Tim and Eric visit the mayor or whatever that garbage show was haha. It killed the entire adult swim fun for me.
Look at the plane crash in Air Force One
Those were all the people on the building at the end of each commercial
My guys here need to go review Kung Fury and all those FX
I come here to watch VFX, they teach us VFX, it's all about the VFX babyyyyy
wow
Seeing Wren's first reaction to Neil Breen is the best way I could've started my day.
I remember freaking out about how weird that morongo ad was when I saw it on tv it’s insane to see it on my favorite show “ VFX “
For bad VFXs check out, Reboot or Beast Wars. Or even, Roughnecks: Starship Troopers
You want bad CGI? I worked for a company called Cinetel Films. Let’s talk.
I've said it several times, but The Requin!
still praying for less wren 🙏
You guys should check out "Warrior of Virtue" and "Alien Nation"
please do more tim and eric
I dont know if this is gonna work but in México when I waq
I dont know if this is gonna work but in México when I waq
I dont know if this is gonna work but in México when I waq
I dont know if this is gonna work but in México when I waq
I dont know if this is gonna work but in México when I waq
I dont know if this is gonna work but in México when I waq
Lmao
wrens distraught face at the neil breen clip was phenomenal
Take a look at the opening chase scene Lockout from 2012. This film just came to my attention and... It's something special.
I don't remember name, but i watched this Indian tv show around 100 episodes about Buddha, particularly about his mother and her life and how she gave birth to Buddha. So there was that sequence about her dream of elephants flying (that predicted buddah birth) and they were so bad sgi that i cried of laughing😂
Ads or sponsors. Please, pick ONE!
4:27 - 5:46 :  The ad.  Me :  What a beautiful Gibson... I definitely don't own one. (: It's also the Freddy Spaghetti guitar from Parks and Recreation!
Do Iron Sky next time ;)
fellas, take a peak at some stunts or effects from Ash vs the evil dead tv series. if the red stuff isn't too spooky for youtube
No therapist can solve my problems and troubled life except Jesus The Lord and Savior. Amen
Do New war within warcraft trailer, for stuntman react star trek ds9 or stargatr stunts. Or chi for those series
For some bad VFX goodness I'd recommend looking at the animals from The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes. Cool movie, rough animal VFX.
Okay, you guys at the Corridor have to check out, and hopefully tear apart, a Doctor Who episode in the David Tennant era called Love and Monsters. It had a creature in it called, and I swear I'm not making this up, an Abzorbaloff, and some of the effects in the episode are just BONKERS!!
Is there use of pre-vis or vfx used in the courtroom? Might be interesting to talk about sometime.
Please please please review the dinosaur documentary from last year, Dinosaurs with Stephen Fry. Its a WHOLE thing. Itll blow your mind how it was made, and how insane and deranged it looks
the fact that i went back to the start of the video to see if wren did in fact say 'vfx' (spoiler alert: he did, i didn't even notice the first time)
I'm still waiting for the Hellboy remake 😅
I have a clip. Retirement Plan on Hulu. There is a scene where Nicolas Cage is thrown a gun and he jumps off of a boat. Not the best movie in the world but it was fun to laugh at in certain parts.
I think people are missing the point with Bag CGI Gator. It's not a monster film where the cgi for the gator is deliberately bad, it's a film where the monster is a bad cgi gator come to life.
Grum looks just like Ernest Borgnine.
Im so glad you looked at a Neil breen film finally. As a red-letter media fan, its genius.
Please do Kung Fu Hustle again, a great movie but goofy  cgi.
Please check out Gaither’s Pond
You guys just came up with a video idea in the first few minutes......,.the nephews render challenge!  One of the crew and one nephew in each team!
More commercials! And where is Oppenheimer??
14:25 "She got Thanos'ed!"😂😂 And every time somebody morphed into another person in that MCU Casino bit they made that grunting/throw up sound🤢 and I laughed harder every time I heard it!😂🤣😂💀
More bad VFX videos! These are always pretty funny episodes. ❤
The street flooding is playing in reverse 😂😂😂
I would like to see more commercial vfx talked about. I remember, about 10 years ago, there was a chocolate commercial with a digital Aubrey Hepburn and my friends and I were absolutely stunned that effects could do that. I would like to see your take on it.
Music videos? Like, even the free ones off other YouTubers like Wintergatan or  Rob Scallon ;)
Lmao "Morongo: we'll get it later."  Uuuugffh FIX IT IN PRE!!
In true Uno Reverse, _Bad CGI Gator_ was going to be way worse, but they ran out of time to f* it up more.
When Wren said MCU? 😂
Hey corridor crew please react to the movie called Brahmāstra. It have a great CGI effects
Friendly reminder that BetterHelp sells your data to advertisers!
Where's the episode of mcu secret war
You guys should check out the commercials for Brazilian soda Dolly. Some of the best worst CGI ever put to film.
There some pretty janky cgi in "rim of the world"
The morongo ads are a great example of a decent concept with terrible execution. Even the continuity aspect was lost on me, would have never realized it were it not for this react
Did you not see all the controversy about Betterhelp? Prob should stop that one
I love how you can see Wren continuously break
If you're looking at commercials, the Canadian "House Hippo" commercial from 1999 is very good (and cute).  Apparently there was a house hippo 2.0 which it's not as good; however, comparing the two may be interesting.
You guys should drop BetterHelp as a sponsor. They misrepresent their offerings and have woefully under qualified counselors on staff.
Just popped in to say the extended version of this is insane.....
Morph Challenge Universe
I wonder where the line between 2D animation and VFX shot is.
Can we have a video that's just Wren singing "crackers and snacks" in a Pilgrim hat?
When Sharknado was in vogue I kinda hoped someone would do a Florida version called GatorCain. 😂
I know in the grand scheme of things it’s not the worst but the pill scene in the heartbreak kid is horrible especially for such a well done movie otherwise
Love your videos as always. Have you considered taking a look at the shortfilm kung fury?
Pls react to Constantine movie ♡
I will try again, but isnt going to be read, Mortadelo and Filemon (2003) is peak visual effects on spain, a slapchop comic adaptation made real. with tons of practical and really nice effects.
You guys have never heard of Morongo Casino • Resort • Spa? It’s where moron go on vacation
You guys have to check out the Guaraná Dolly ads that have the character Dollynho ( usually the father's day ones are the best ). Love the content 🔥
I grew up about 20 mins away from Morongo, back when it started as a tiny little bingo hall in a repurposed old fruit orchard shop store it has really come a long way. Funny to see those awful commercials for them. They work though, people talk about them (maybe for the wrong reason though 😂)
I am that nephews
Neil Breen the GOAT
Im not even sure if it's a thing, but you should do something about the classic films of Uwe Boll :D
Seeing Wren's introduction to Neil Breen just made my whole weekend!
Neil Breen will most likely respond to this video.  I would DIE if he were sitting on the couch for at least one future episode.
This was hilarious
This was remarkably respectful to the creators of that content, you guys were awesome, this video totally nailed it.  You picked those samples perfectly.  Fun, lighthearted, and amazing analysis.
What about the Usedphorea commercial with the long floating hair on the dude I. The grocery store.
I got to see the premier of Big Shark with the man Tommy Wiseau himself in the theater. It was an amazing experience, everyone was laughing and having the best time and he seemed to really love it. The movie is also genuinely hilarious.
EYES ON BREEN
Neil Breen is the best bad filmmaker alive. His funniest movie is probably Fateful Findings, but they're all masterpieces of incompetence.
The Gator scenes weren't uniquely bad though it was like trying to hard to be stupid, especially the ending
Don't know if you've been asked before but the bullet effects in the transporter...
change the title to vfx
The latest Expendable movie, helicopter blowing up the tank scene near the beginning.
It's surprising to see BetterHelp sponsoring so many YouTube videos after what happened.  (Selling "private" medical info)
I kind of want to see them react to Lavalantula and 2 Lava 2 Lantula, maybe get Steve Guttenberg to join.
Love that Breen.
I said multiple times before, the St George Tango advert should be reacted to. Really well done for an older advert.
In Big Shark, when you said "the scene where the street is flooding isn't the worst", I'm surprised nobody mentioned that it looks like the water is splashing backwards.
The shot transition with the person walking to the next one would be cool if it was actually done well
Finally Tim and Eric get their well deserved recognition
Breenscreen®
You should do an uncanny render challenge.
If yous guys do another animators react, I would love to see James Lee covered. He does stylized live footage blended with 2d.
Mr Breen should work with our fav gun-toting, chair-rolling lardass Mr Seagal
I live near the Morongo Casino... Yes those commercials are that bad.
9:55 THE FEAR 😂😂
Search up CB12 commercials
If you haven’t already seen it on the show yet you guys should react to return to witch mountain
Neil Breen movies are bad, but I really wish the Corridor Crew would watch a couple of Bill Zebub movies. By comparison, Neil Breen's movies would be considered summer blockbusters.
Garth menges dark place is the epitome of good bad. Would love to see you guys check it out.
WHY IS NO YOU ONE TALKING ABOUT THE WAHLBURGER BEHIND HER?? CONFIRMED WAHLBURGER IN THE MCU?!?!?!
Are you guys messing with me? I've been asking you to look at the movie the requin with Alicia Silverstone for like two years!!! Please for the love of the universe!!! Please look at the CGI in it, please!!!
Bad CGI Gator had no right to be as fun as it was.
Could you guys do a segment on Shin Kamen Rider? Specifically, the Wasp fightscene?
The fact that they put GRUM on this lol
Nothing makes me laugh harder than Sam absolutely losing it
Day 1001 of me asking you guys to react to Ghostbusters Afterlife’s VFX.
You really shouldn't be taking money from them, it's widely known that they are an awful company and it's reflecting really poorly on you.  (I used to be a big fan of Corridor Digital.)
doesn't betterhelp sell your sensitive data ...
I think this is the most fun I’ve seen the crew have
A YouTube channel called Space Ice does the best breakdowns on Breen movies (and Steven Seagal)
I don't think I could watch the extended episode. My stomach already hurts.
Is that Pat Mcafee on the morono cassino and resort commercial? Please let it be.
Sam chewing away on a toothpick is weirdly unsettling
STOP ADVERTISING BETTER HELP THEY CALL COPS ON PEOPLE IN CRISIS. THEY ARE NOT HELP, THEY ARE A FOR PROFIT SCAM DESIGNED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF PEOPLE THAT NEED HELP. DO BETTER FFS.
Have you guys ever looked at the RDJ Sherlock Holmes movies? Specifically the second movie, it's full of VFX shots but they blend so well that you really don't notice them
I've never seen Wren so broken.
Did I just watch corridor breakdown a casino ad?…yes yes I did🫠🥹😂
Welcome back to our entirely new show, Visual Effects.
You guys should watch ReBoot if you haven't already !
Can't recall when's the last time MCU made me smile, but here we are.
Thats like 80s Video Toaster morphing
9:35 Pretty sure he makes money because he has thousands of enablers paying to see the ongoing trainwreck which is his career. I occasionally wonder whether he *realizes* he's only popular because he's possibly the single worst filmmaker currently working.  Also 12:00 I didn't know people were still using Power Goo in productions! 🤣
Here’s a weird Stunt video request: ‘The Man from Snowy River’. The coordination involved with the horses is nuts, especially in the final act of the movie. Would highly recommend this one!
We need a Corridor Crew bad commercial competition immediately
never enjoyed like they didin the commercial ad
You guys watch this music video called Bastille - Torn Apart! Their character morphing is something y'all would really enjoy.
Neil Breen is the only real human breen.  The reason his garbage rocks and pseudo fake "bad movies" like bad cg gator or sharknado etc do not rock is because he's not in on the joke. Even that new Wiseau thing is him winking at the camera saying "ha ha it's bad so it's funny right?".  But Breen is honest. This is his art, and he believes in it, and it's fucking incredible.
I feel like Neil Breen was the inspiration for the character of Abed in the series Community, who makes zany homemade films.
I don't trust the people who visit Morongo Casino. Imagine you meet this beautiful woman, wonderful young lady, you get along great, she follows you to your room and as you turn around she morphs into Joe from Dallas. You're shocked to see a person change so horrendously right before your eyes, but it doesn't matter, you feel your eyes vibrate, the air leave your lungs, you forget your name, life, identity. You are no longer Chris, you are now Michelle the CCO of some paperclip company and you always have been.
What gator on that first scene???
Velocipastor, his parents' car crash , its short but it's the best cgi scene in any movie ever I'd do anything to see you guys reach to it please
Idk if you guys already did but you should react to the Ted Movies and the Ted show that just came out. The CGI on ted is actually good
Check out the glass they're talking about at 16:27, the glass itself gets locked into the plate but then she picks it up so it doubles!
no waay yall looked at grum
10:00 that is everyone’s reaction seeing this for the first time 😂
I have a video idea you guys should look at the new echo show
Am i the only one hearing Greg Bissonette voicing that casino commercial and why is he doing it?!?!
Neil Breen is the man! Or, at least... a man. He's my favorite narcissistic auteur director.
The thing that stops me from enjoying Neil Breen "films" is that he is SO creepy..
You should make a video with neil Breen. Let him direct a 5 min video with you guys producing it and doing the vfx. I think it’ll be great concept
Have ya'll ever reacted to "Kung Fury?" Because if not you need to add that to the list.
For the next stuntmen react episode you should react to the house fight in Cobra Kai season 3 episode 10.
I'm stoked that you highlighted Neil Breen. If you want more bad CGI films, watch The Exigency
Have they ever taken a look at the Shrek: Retold movie? I think that would be right up their ally. :D
I find hilarious that the crocodile roars like a lion
We need more Bollywood vids!!
Sharknado all the way!!!!! lolll
If you wanna see some really janky vfx check out this b grade Indian movie called " jaani dushman : ek anokhi kahani "
Challenge idea: Make the artists' nephews produce shots with the artists' direction.
How I Met Your Mother has great yanky cgi
I feel like Bad CGI Gator feels like false advertising. I was expecting a gator out of a PS1 game, instead I got a gator out of a PS1 cutscene.
NEW SHOW IDEA: Make Bad CGI Gator worse— then do other movies and make good CGI/VFX intentionally bad and share what you did intentionally that amateurs do accidentally. 💁🏻‍♂️
Recently found out that Labyrinth had the first attempt at a photo realistic animal during the opening credits. Definitely think they should react to that
what about music videos? 2 for starters The Chemical Brothers - Hey Boy Hey Girl and Coldplay - The Scientist
I see that Casino commercial all the time when I watch Lakers games. I will forever associate that hunting sound with those morphs.
MCU wins most satisfying loop
Many of these are examples of "good render, bad compositing". It's not enough to be good at modelling, texturing and rendering, you gotta comp that shiz
Jordan looks like a young version of that meme of the old guy who’s in pain  (Good thing)
I kind of can’t believe you haven’t done any Doctor Who episodes. Since 2005, every season has excellent examples of good, bad and interesting effects. Great for talking about working under a budget!
This episode broke something inside Wren
Ahhhhh Neil Breen lol His work is just... Impecible lol
CCC  Cc
Please don’t take more sponsorship from betterhelp.
Wren just looks like he's having 3 near mental breakdowns throughout the whole video.
Have a look at Garth merengies dark place it’s a master class in makeing a tv show bad on purpose
I'm so happy Tim and Eric somehow found it's way here. I love them so much
“Decent CGI Gator” is honestly a funnier title lol
Depends on who is doing the add and the tone they use you know what the as is... like i knew it was better help from the first second of the ad
You guys need to watch Manborg! or anything from Astron 6 tbh
Thank you, Corridor. Every time a human being learns about Neil Breen, the world becomes just a little bit better.  Thank you.
It's not a loop, it's a Spiral!!
Anyone else get defensive over RLM when they started discussing Neil Breen?
These video are so much more fun without the experts
Please review the terrible and hilarious CGI episode of 'The Blacklist.' It is the season 7 finale episode titled "The Kazanijan Brothers".
Just watched Earthquake, which won Oscars and had some crazy shots for 1974.
WHERE'S THE SECRET SANTA VIDEO?????
We should have good and bad CGI react to VFX artists.
Wren looks well and truly disturbed throughout this episode.
we want another vfx artists react to bollywood!!!!!!
Do they not have dentists where you lot live?
Hi, shirt idea: "Straight Out Of Comped-In."  I would like 15%. Thanks.
Can you do a STUNTMAN reacts to Singing in the Rain please!
mfw Jordan is on the couch: :D Also you can see Sam's soul leave his body when he learns about Big Shark.
please take a look at The Avengers (1998)
Every Saturday baby
the pillgrum thing reminded me of that bad movie made in Community (the TV show)
Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2
Hell yes, Neil Breen
Maybe I think you have to talk about "Beowulf-2007" film  everytime when I see Angelina Jolie's first scene i thought it's real shot not cgi shot
Who is your target audience? 14 year olds?
Ah man that gator mastered levitation 😅😂
Eyes on Breen.
Eyes on Breen. Eyes on Breen.
You guys have to react to the "2016 ghana movie". The short trailer is amazing and hilarious
Love the vids and energy. Y’all never get old.
I've only made it through 2/3 of the new "Aquaman: The Uncanny Valley" before I had to stop. You could do a whole episode about this piece of crap. Many reviewers have stated it will be on their worst of 2024 lists, while it makes my top ten of worst films EVER.
Finally my man Grum gets some recognition, next up Xavier Renegade Angel
11:10
Neil Breen, the legend!
You should do a challenge to see who can make the best worst VFX shot
There's new UFO videos. I hope we get the debunk videos soon
Is that Gregg Bissonette doing the Morongo Casino commercial voiceover?
Some Breen, finally.
3D squelton says "BOO HOO"
I saw this morongo ad on my gyms tv and thought I can’t wait till corridor reacts to this 😂
I think getting young amateur cgi artists to do "bad" cgi in a film is actually a great idea.  I'm sure they would learn so much about the film making process that they could carry forward in life.
This show only gets better!!
Had to double take when i saw Grum, from the pilgrums on the thumbnail. Hope Glenn Tennis watches this.
Who else likes crackers and snacks?
16:28 she takes the glass and it also stays on the table
This is nowthing, you need to see Rapsittie Street Kids
If there Is a sequel to Bad CGI Gator, it should be named Bad CGI Glitched Gator because It looks like an NPC animal from and RPG game that became glitched and is floating on the map 🤣 Talking about the Moronga Casino Universe, that isn't VFX nor a Skrull, Is just Mystique who got a cool job in the casino which is located in Genosha island.😂
And here I am
They broke Wren.
I think the bad cgi gator needs to be thought of as if it actually exists in-universe as-is.
my new ringtone is "hwwaaaauuunnnnngghhhhh"
How does one get good at editing? Trying to learn how to use da Vinci and YouTube helps but I get stuck with transitioning from shots.
maybe the bad of the bad cgi gator is more that its bad, evil, malevolent rather than a measure of quality?
I wonder if the vfx gator animator was very talented but just gave himself 30 min for each shot.
Self aware artists can't make Good Bad movies. Most of the cheap CGI horror movies are made by self aware people, so they feel bland. True Good-Badness comes from a mixture of overconfidence, incompetence, and lack of self awareness.
I like Grum, he likes crackers and snacks!
YESS
Their reactions to legitimately awful vfx are so pure and enjoyable. I had missing these, thanks!!!
Wow Neil Breen clips LOL! Legendary
Guys Better Help is under fire for bad practices. Please look into it and reconsider their sponsorship
Im earllly❤🎉
I miss my cinco cube
Torque (2004), awful CGI, even worse physics sims, and horrific stunts. The full trifecta.
Debunk the Jellyfish UAV !!!! 👽
finally a bad part cause yall were being too nice lol
I love this show
1st to COMMNENT.
I watched the Kevin Hart movie LIFT last night.  The VFX were absolutely terrible.
Y’all should look at the first chronicals of narnia. Specifically the part where the goblet of hot chocolate turns into snow
Please for the love of all that is holy, watch and react to velocioastor, one of the greatest intentionally bad movies I’ve ever seen
Will you guys try to debunk the Miami mall alien videos and the new uap or ufo next week
Neil breen is the goat, we need a lot more of his movies on here
Dang never been this early to catch a new episode!
Please react to the flash season 3 episode 20, when savitar first steps out of his suit and reveals his identity to Barry.
Bad effects are the best effects. Because someone had to look at them and and go "It's good enough".
Finally! A chance to have my stuff featured. Do you take submissions?!?
Bad CGI Alligator had better CGI than i expected...
I love the vfx show!
Great 😊
Challenge idea: have the participants make Zach King-style visual effect sequences. Maybe in teams of two? Or individually? Judged by Zach King if he's up for it.
22nd!!!!!1!
React to ape vs mecha ape..... 😂😂 I can't believe its 2023 movie

Usually they would have a good to counter act the bad, but now it’s over loading with to much bad.
The vfx aren't bad, they are just ahead of the time.
Who else had to rewind that intro 🤣
79th like lest goo
We want Bollywood reaction Adipurush  Ganpath  Pathan Tiger 3 😅
If you want good, bad CGI, try Sharknado, or anything from either Asylum Productions or SyFy.
I see Tommy wiseau, I click
Yooooooo people.
please do the transformation scene from Splash
I am quick today ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Chillydog on a highway, I'm waiting for the actual space battleship Yamato anime react, a good mix between 2d and 3d
Yooo
Not first
Love your work, keep it up :D
I love being early on a video
The worst are still better than what I could do tbh.
Woop!
Keep up the good work guys!!
first!!!! (update, or second! dammit!)
Slay
This is gonna be wild
