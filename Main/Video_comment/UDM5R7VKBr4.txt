Tell me the tea 🥹
I like the temp in my house to be 45 to 50°
23:28 grandma just knows things all along the way
love bryan!!!
After watching house tour part 2, im rewatching the house videos from when Lucas and the boys came to work on her house!!!!!! 😊 Paying closer attention this time around. Lucas at about 13:54, how did i miss that before❤
I’m so happy for you.   But your clumsy ass sitting on top of something, on the floor edge, and saying “there’s no cliffs to fall off” made me laugh 😂
omggg not you ignoring lucas and his one liner 🤧
You should build a pool and make Morganchella come true
Ooof 😍
Lucas liiiikeees herrrr 😌
Who doesn’t love Lucas. The whole team are just great but Lucas is adorable
Im late to the progress so I have a couple more videos but im over here crying now you’ve waited so long for this to happen im so proud of you Morgan I really am ❤❤
Your eyebrows looks good Morgan
this house transformation is as old as my daughter !!! :0
What are the songs she used if anyone knows plz tell me
Okay but I need to know the name of the song at 15/16 minutes I can’t find it anywhere
Blair changed so much 😱
Btw that skinny dude with the hat is your soul mate
So happy for you!!!
I know you’re excited for the end of this project after all the struggles through it all, but I bet you’re gunna miss all the boys immensely after it’s all over 😭 and I think we all will too.
Purposely missed this one and the last two so I can binge watch the progression of your beautiful home!! 😍
5 WEEKS TO HANG DRYWALL?! WHAT?! We built a 5 thousand sq ft custom home ourselves subbing out things like the roof & drywall etc. The guys hung our sheetrock within 1 week no joke & with a very small crew! Hispanics know how to get the job done & done right! They did quality work & kicked butt on our Victorian replica home with 10 ft high slick ceilings. I cannot believe she said 5 wks. No way!
Me crying to the song and you’re beautiful walls. September is always the best month. We’re all so happy for you Morgan 😭😭❤️❤️❤️
Where is Sam going?
Omg morgan how do you even know blaire walnut?!?! 😭😭
♥️
I love this for her 💙💙💙
The few exposed beams forever let stick house shine through ❤
Your parents are awesome we need parents like yours ❤️❤️
Ive been following this since the beginning and I cried with you every single video I’m so happy this is finally happening with walls 🎊 ❤️ I can’t even imagine the pain and stress of this but it’s gonna be amazing
I don't think I ever want to build a house 🏘️ this has been torture for you 😮
It’s finally happening!! 🥰🥰 glad you’ve taken us on this journey<3
Morgan, I've been fortunate enough to own 2 homes. Remodeled 1 and built 1 from the ground up. Yes, there are many headaches, especially if you live in an area with strict building codes, red tape, and delays. If I knew you personally, I would tell you... "Nothing worthwhile in life is easy" Let that be your new mantra. The general contractor you hired is doing a phenomenal job for you, he is doing everything by the book which will only benefit you as a homeowner. As your home ages you will have fewer upkeep nightmares, and structural problems, well that's my hope for you. It's a beautiful home you helped design, and you paid for with your hard work, blood sweat, and tears! When it's finished and the keys are turned over to only you, you will feel so satisfied and proud that you realized your dream! It may not be the journey you anticipated, but all roads are leading to the desired end result! You are making your vision a reality!  Not many people at any age can say that. These government headaches will pass, and you will be in your home soon. Be proud, take a deep breath, and pat yourself on the back for a job well done! Congratulations!
I love seeing you so happy 🥹💓
loving the little film pic inserts!
I’m confused do you own the actual house on the property and you’re just finishing the barn as a guest house ? Or
Please I beg you make a podcast 🫶🏻
You do deserve it, enjoy it🤗
I’m so happy for you! I love it
Our dads share a birthday 😂
So happy for you morgan🩷
Can’t wait for the update!!!
I always feel like September is the month where everything gets better again too! I might be biased as a Virgo but... September is a golden month of all things good, I've been following your home journey for so long and you deserve allll the good things! xx
Not me crying when u finally see the walls up
Not Me checking back too much so ready for more updates and reveals 🎉
Grandma coming in hot with Lucas tea?! 👀
Dying thinking about the insta girlies asking if your never ending house construction is for views 😂😂
I always get so excited when she posts and she never disappoints 🤩
Morgan not me crying 😭😭😭😭
I love your Palm Springs sweater ❤ Palm Springs misses you come back to visit !!!!
That's so freaking awesome, Morgan!!!! You got walls on my birthday !!!!!!! 🎂🎆🎉 you deserve NOTHING but the absolute BEST!!! ❤
Super proud of you. Don't let anything tear you apart or put you down ever. Life is too short to care too much and spend it not happy. Be happy stay positive.
“SkyGan” podcast coming soon! ❤🎉
I’m so happy for you Morgan! The true joy in your eyes is amazing! ❤
Love home updates. When can we move in?
If you don’t marry Lucas can you send him my way and I will😂 we love you Morgan!!!❤️❤️
Morgan! Your videography style from framing to editing is the best! It’s so nice to see your home come together!
I am so happy to see you happy! We seen the progress and we know it hasn't been easy but I know you are with the right ppl love the crew! 💚💚💚💚
You’re beautiful Morgan
Not me literally balling my eyes out
Can't wait to a tell all podcast!!
Morgan I'm so proud of you for not giving up!!
I feel crazy but did anyone see the “I 💘 you 😊”?! 21:12  It’s gotta be Lucas. Morgan, it’s all coming together, you deserve all this happiness.
"He messed me up" is it because you guys are in looooveee??
Why did I cry with you when you saw the walls actually in the house for the first time at 15:36
Proud of u I feel u we are finishing up are remodeling after 3 yrs was so long but life happened and we lived in house but it’s done finally feels so rewarding
This brings me back to when I had my house built a year ago. NIGHTMARE!!! Every little thing took forever, issues with every step. Never again. I'll die in this house!
I feel like building a house in whatever county she’s in is not worth it lol
Truly brought me to tears. My life has really been bringing me down and it feels like my walls are crumbling. good to see your walls are finally being built and all you’ve been through is paying off. Gives me hope that there is still beauty in this life. today I cried tears of joy to be able to see you accomplish such a thing in your life.. i’m the same age as you and I work at Lowes I don’t feel like I have near the accomplishments. I don’t even have a goal list and it breaks my heart. I watch you achieve such big goals at your age. It’s such a beautiful thing. I hope you keep going in the direction you are, and keep making content if it makes you happy because it truly gives me hope for a better life.
Just remember to count ur blessings bc someone always has it worse like me and my daughter bc I worked all week but had to pay rent so we dont have any money for food. ANd we will starve for the next two weeks. But I guess i am grateful im not homeless or jobless and we have our health but it is really hard when ur young child doesn't understand why i wont give her food or a drink
So excited for you!! If all goes well do you expect to be in the house for Christmas?
you definitely should start a podcast
Is trinity still going to live with morgan???
OHMYGOSH MORGAN IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU!!!
I must have missed something, I thought Trinity was gonna be her roommate?
I don’t claim my 25th year is soooo valid
Hey Morgan, I can completely understand your mental state. 5 years ago I was homeless. I was given my flat and it had this awful wallpaper all over. I started stripping it, not thinking it would be an issue and all the plaster started falling in. For over a year I had to fight my landlords to sort out the walls. I had to get a politician involved. For what felt like forever I looked like I lived in some awful cave, all this after homelessness. I was gutted! When they did come and fix things the walls were so damaged they had to take it back to the Breeze block and put dry wall up and plaster over that. It only took about a week. I finally got to decorate and it finally felt like a home! Next week I have flooring going down. It's taken years but it's my home. It's finally all coming together. And I know it's a different set of circumstances but watching this video really brought me back to how I felt at that time. Especially when you were getting emotional about the walls. I remember that! I wish you the best of luck! And I think you've been so strong and determined! I can't wait to see this finished and I can completely understand how you're feeling. You're so close now. And that fight for years will make it all worth while. You'll always appreciate your home more than most because of the work you've had to put into it and the patience you've needed
Morgan you’re glowinggg omg
make a podcast queen <3 pls w trinity!!!!
MORGAN 💫🍂✨🌾🤎 September looks GOOOOD on you girl. Keep shining!
Runway score 1,000,000 Mili dang gurl
Please marry Lucas and fill those rooms with little blue eyed cutie babies 🫶
The government is not on your side until Obamacare comes through for you.
not me crying for you for finally getting walls in your house!!
I’m so happy for you, Morgan.  Watching you get emotional over walls made me want to cry - I’ve been with you throughout this whole journey from the beginning so I can’t even imagine the feels you felt.  Thank you for bringing us along the ups and downs - the sun is really shining for you ✨

As a girl who had a building built from the ground up, I feel you so much. The moment you sat down and look at the unfinished room, silently, full of joy. That’s the most precious time.

Morgan, you deserve absolutely everything good in the world. Your heart is so pure and you deserve to be happy. I can’t wait to see what you do to this place!
"I absolutely do not deserve this at all" MISS MORGAN yes you DO! Bouncing back from all those knock-downs, you TOTALLY deserve this 😘🥰

BRIAN AND HSI CREW ARE AWESOME
The day that we see a house tour is the day our lives will feel full again💗
I seen the notification come up a couple days ago and I was having an emotional day. I knew I could not come to watch it and stay mentally healthy. I know you don’t know me but I have been here since the beginning. I am a little older. Hahaha. Late 40s but if anyone ask. Morgan you and I are besties. I watched today. And tears are flowing. 😢😢  when Bryan said thank you for your patience I wanted to answer him.  Hahahahahahahahahaha. I am so excited for you having your own place your home. This will be soo good for your mental health and everything. Thank you Jesus   Oh and 1 more thing. If you ever ever wanna have a girls night I’m sure myself grandma mom and all the ladies here would love to have a sleepover and walk down the catwalk stairs in hills and just laugh. ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤. Let’s do it. ❤😂😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
I’m sooooo happy for you I cried lmao !!!!! This tooook soooo freaking long it feels like a dream to me as a viewer ahahaha ❤😂
You DO deserve this, Morgan. My partner and I have been building our cabin at the same time you’ve been building your home. I genuinely think that because you had to bear through it for so long, that you’re going to appreciate every corner and detail of your new home more than most that snap their fingers and have something built. Congratulations, I’m always rooting for you.
The editing on this one is top tier. Also if you don’t remain friends with your builders after all of this I will be devastated 😅 y’all just get each other
why am i crying?
so happy for you !
so happy for you !
Hello love you from India delhi
You are just going to appreciate everything so much more.  It will soon be your home.  Your own home that you helped build.  You are almost there.💜

Morgan you’re one of my favourite #girlhood YouTubers. And we acknowledge all the blood, sweat and tears you’ve put in this house. And just so you know THAT HOUSE IS LITERALLY YOUR LEGACY. YOUR STORY. And I can’t wait for the house to be finished. You’ll get through it. 🥰🥰🥰
Congratulations girl. Do not let any weird setbacks keep you off the path of completion, and no more tears of sadness.  It's really happening. And I'm so very happy for ya! Best wishes, Sam!

Morgan, I know that this has been a long and arduous journey, but it will be totally worth it once your home is finished! 💗
Sooo happy for you & boy did that team do an amazing job on the house 🤍🥂
⚠️CAUTION LADIES⚠️   Do NOT wear white nail polish on your TOES. (Fingers is fine) Especially out at a bar with your husband. Apparently it means you are open to swinging. Dont learn the hard way like me 😅
The same way you looked at the walls with admiration is the same way I looked at my first classroom after getting it organized. The “it’s happening, I did it” feeling is so so good
SO HAPPY FOR YOU MORGYYY
A podcast THAT SHOULD EXIST!
You're doing great sweetie!😊 ive been watching you try to build and all the bumps in the road wiith this damn farm barn since the start and i knew this day would eventually come and im so proud and happy for you babe!! You deserve it 🏚🏡
I love you Morgan, you QUEEN ♥️
Manifesting this year’s Vlogmas in Morgan’s new stick home 🙏🏻

Lucas ELIZABETH LOL 😂
I hope to always have the happiness feeling that Morgan got when she saw walls going up in her house,I’m so happy for you Morgan that your house is finally showing some progress wish you the best forever and always ❤
I hope to always have the happiness that Morgan has when she sees walls going up in her house 😊
Lucas aand Morgan would be soooo cuteee together just sayinnn
Not Lucas saying atta girl TWICE. I'd be on the floor.
Guuurrrlll you just played deaf on that boy!! You could of responded 😂❤
Grandma not only knows you need to spread your wings and live your young life but that she only wants to visit....even though i know she loves every moment she spends with you! She's so precious and reminds me so much of my own relationship with my grandma. Makes me miss mine so much but love seeing you and Ryland sharing your lives with her and actively including her into so many parts of your life.
Sooooo excited for you! I have had to put my own home reno on hold (but will soon be doing "small-ish" diy projects) and have been cheering on your project.... Cuz i could tell from the initial walk-through vids that (even without major personal changes) you were going to hit some frustrations.....but it is always so fulfilling as you finish anything you change to your own property. I applaud all you've personally done and all the stress you've endured throughout this project. I wish you endless memories (many of which have already been started or happened) that further build that house into YOUR HOME! Whatever you build, grow, or dream into form while in those walls.... Cherish it all! Learn from the struggles and bask in the beautiful moments!
Whoever is following you with camera is shaking as fuxk
GIRL IF YOU DID A PODCAST I WOULD DIE, PLEASE!!!!! 😍😍😍
15:50 please turn up the music, I could almost hear you 😭
OMG I'm sooo happy for you Morgan can't wait to see the project finished!
I hope the contractor don’t talks advantage of her
Girl I just finished my house and it is so satisfying at the end of it.❤ Your so close. Congrats!
Why did I start sobbing when your grandma said she’d go over every day. 🥹💛
Wow! I’m so happy for you. I’ve been watching since you moved to Colorado and bought the house. I’m gonna keep on watching!!!

I can’t believe your dad and I share birthdays hahahaha second dad that i know with the same birthday as me, i love it 😂❤
I think everyone watching this has probably been following along this whole time just genuinely rooting for your house. So excited for you! ☺️
Can't wait to see it finished...I'm so happy 4 you😊

Ugh!! I’m so happy for you!! I’m so glad you’re happy too!!
At this point I hope Morgan has a open house for the public when it’s done because I am also very invested in this house. I did not think I would ever get emotional over someone else’s walls but here we are 🥺 I am so happy for you Morgan, it’ll look like a dream before you know it
F Douglas county!!
Very happy for you!
I’ve been watching for the last 4 years! I am soo fuckin happy for you Morgan!! I can’t wait to see how your home continues to become a safe happy inspiring place for you!!! Much love ❤
When you get to the part where you are decorating, if you have a small nook. You should make a place for you and your grandma to do puzzles and take naps in a recliner.
God, I hope you are right that September is the month where things get good.   My birthday is in September and I turned thirty today. I am hoping it all gets good from here.   P.S. Love to see you happy and healthy.
Yaaay for walls! You were making a little emotional! Congratulations 🥰
The tea is… who was grandma alluding to 😏 who will move in? I did see a guy walking quickly by in the background a couple of videos ago… dun dun dunnnnnnn 😬🫢

I love the natural light in the house so much, like during day & golden hour, Morgan’s editing makes every little detail so beautiful & lovely   - so so happy for this moment that we’ve been waiting with you for & can’t wait to keep following every step ☺️🤍
As someone who's watched from the beginning, i cried too Morgan 🥹 congratulations!! Its been a long time coming and im so happy for you!!❤
Tell your parents they are breeding mold if their house is too humid
I'm so happy u finally got walls and it's coming together I have been here since the beginning ❤
Morgan i'm with you !!! I'm 1 and an half years into renovation like yours and still not have walls (not every where) stick house gang 😂 i'm so happy you finaly have walls !
I forgot how much Morgans grandma reminded me of my grandma. They have the same personality. I lost my grandma on the 6th of this month. I wasn't expecting to bawl my eyes out watching this but I did. Cherish your grandmas while you got them, I miss mine!
I’m an empathetic cryer Morgan has me crying about walls 🎉❤😅
I luv ur personality, n i cant wait to see the final house tour! Would u pls tell me where u got those black sunglasses from?
The song at 10.48 anyone 🥺
Morgan how much does something like this cost? Because I want to do this one day and I need to save 😊
You did it!!!
My heart was filled with so much joy and excitement for this💕
Morgan we love the videos ❤
3 cheers for these flippin’ walls! So excited Morgan!!! 👏🏼
Morgan, do you know a good lawyer by chance? Yes in Colorado
Week Of Walls = WOW
This literally brings me so much joy for you! This process as a viewer has been a roller coaster, but for you I can't imagine! Way to persevere when it felt like you couldn't do it anymore! I am SO excited to see this house when it's finally done
I honestly can’t believe how hyped I am about walls but here we are. CONGRATS ON YOUR WALLS!!!!!!
Congratulations.  A LONG TIME COMING
Time for a Pepsi *grabs sprit* 😂
I’ve missed Sam and Lucas so much
I cried seeing the walls go up. Girl, you've been through so much with this house. I'm so happy to see you smile 🥹
Gramma says you have a roommate but she won’t say. Hmmmm. What does that mean MORGAN!!!!! 😭😂😍😍😍
Looking good! Can’t wait to see the finished project and then vlogs on you living your best life in the house you built with Brian and his great team! Vlogs on cooking in your kitchen, fashion vlogs in your room, decor vlogs on the changing decor seasonally, and on and on! The end of this project will just signify the beginning of many more…..gardening, landscape, chickens, hosting bbq’s, the ideas are endless!
OMG!!! when I tell you that at 15:37 I couldn't hold it anymore and started balling!!!!!!!!!!! I am so happy for you girly!!! Almost there ❤
You make me smile
I'm so happy for you, Morgan!  PS Lucas delivered a hella good line with what he said around 14:15.
We love you Morgan. But you GOTTA tell us if you and Lucas are a thing.
Ok first off you were always you before this house, but by all means I can't wait to see what you do with this portion of your life!
I got goosebumps seeing Morgan see her first walls after all this time. You’re on the “HOME” stretch now sweetie!!!! This internet auntie is so proud of and happy for you!!!!!! 💕😎🏡
Girrlllllll ❤ why dont you post on your other channel telling everyone that your here now i thought you disappeared 😢 and then i found this channel with recent posts ❤❤❤❤❤ lol had zero idea!!!!!
I don’t believe I have ever seen you smile like you are in this video. Of the last few years, especially since buying the house, I’ve watched you try to find what brings you joy, and the look on your face when you looked at those walls wasn’t just joy. It was pure love, happiness and appreciation for the help from the guys. I am absolutely overjoyed that your moment is finally here for you. Congratulations hun ❤❤❤ I love you so much. Keep your chin up. It’s your time
Morgan you have the best channel on YouTube! Idk how to explain it, you’re personality is perfect for this. It’s not annoying, it’s not obnoxious it’s PERFECT!
You’re gonna need to get on a comfy sofa and watch the money pit when this is over
I love seeing you happy ♥️🙌🏼😊That. Is. All .
morgan when are you gonna drop merch so we can get you back in school and this house finished 😂
💖💖💖
Morgan you got more emotional over your walls than any other shit you’ve gone through omg. And that’s how I know how much it means to you. Congrats girly 💕
We love you so much and that fucking house is beautiful ❤❤🎉🎉
Can someone catch me up why is the house taking so long ? 🥲
You give me hope that there's better things to come in life
Lucas MVP
Get it gurl, gwt that home. Done. We are proud of you. They say patience pays off. And I know I'm the type of person that really doesn't have patients either❤ but I think you learn it the more you go on in life. And this is going to be a stunning house when it's done🎉🎉🎉🎉.
Why did I think she was topless? At first. 😂😂😂
A quote for you to use "September is the month you'll always remember"

maybe make one room or space into meditation area, somewhere to go when shit hits the fan & you need a breather with nothing to overstimulate you. i have bad anxiety so that sounds amazing to me 🤣.
Awwww, Morgan!!!! I'm so proud of you & so happy this is all finally happening for you! ❤
So happy for you…this is such an achievement girl! 🎉🎉🎉
So proud of you girly, watching how happy you are literally made me cry❤️✨
Congrats Morgan! You have come a long way!! 🎉
I am so so happy for you!!!
You know I too have been traumatized by a home renovation when I’m tearing up at your walls. Congratulations 🍾
Lucas Blank was really shooting his shot 👀 😂
Yay! We have walls Morgan!
You look beautiful 😍 Morgan and love the vibes of you and your friends helping you work on your house. ✨ ✨
Okay who else thinks Morgan and Lucas would make the best couple!!
MORGAN I AM SO HAPPY FOR YOUU!! AHHH
You should have Ryland design a room for you!
I'm so glad the boys are back if I ever need a house built since I'm in Colorado I'll definitely ask for them
What did grandma Janice mean?👀👀👀👀  morgannnn?????? Who’s the roomieeee?! Lucas???! 👀👀👀
So so very happy for you 😻
When the world tried to give you lemons, you hung in there and made lemonade, congratulations 🎉
You got walls bish!!! Look at u surrounded by ur very own walls!!! I have never been this excited about someone getting walls but I've been around since u started youtube and this journey has been a Rollercoaster. I mean u have always had ups and downs but this house..... girl..... I was wondering if either of y'all be standing at the end. And both yall are so it's amazeballs
I will never in my lifetime be financially stable enough to afford a place of my own I mean unless I somehow secure and trick a man into supporting me which doesn't look like it's happening either 🤣🤣 what am I doing to myself mentally by watching this 🥹🥹 built a whole ass house from scratch? Couldn't be me
Sad tears or happy tears if Morgan's crying, so am I !!  ❤❤❤
Im so parasocially invested in your happiness Morgan, not me actually tearing up multiple times in this video. I’m so happy and proud of you girl!  Also, can you do an updated “what’s on my face” style video and share your whole makeup routine please! I have a Sephora gift card and very similar skin as yours and need to know how to look as amazing as you!!
The music, though 🤢
I’m so happy for you!🎉
Lucas is so nice! I hope this is your new boo soon 😍❤️😘! You look stunning
Hooray🎉🎉🎉Morgan!! Your almost there.! So happy for you I know it’s going to be beautiful! Can’t wait to see when your setting up furniture in the rooms of your house! 🎉🎉🎉
So happy for you Morgan, you truly deserve this!
I WANT THAT CLASSIC FORD F150

Manifesting Lucas and Morgan’s wedding 🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹😩😩❤️❤️❤️
The journey is almost complete! I'm thrilled for you, it's been a wild ride!
I’m so happy it’s finally coming together for you!   But I’m still going to miss the house updates I’ve had for the last two years! So happy you are so happy! ♥️
so happy for you Morgan! congratulations! its been a long time coming
Love it Morgan! So excited to continue watching it unfold! 🤍 such an inspiration and also realistic! When we bought our house we thought it’d be ready to move into, after a little bit of work done, in maybe a month… we stayed with our parents as a newly married couple… 😅 it took half a year… I can’t imagine the process of gutting and restarting a house, but now after living in this house for 5 years I almost wish we had or still could sometimes 😅
Wow when this journey started I was about to enter my senior year of high school and now I’m a sophomore in college and it feels like we’ve been through the ups and downs together, I really can’t believe how fast time flies and I’m really proud of you Morgan, I hope you are as well. Cant wait to see the stick house become a stick home🩵💪🏻
I love you Morgan❤
Yay finally walls baby!
I'm so happy for you! Your house is looking amazing!!  😊🎉
I love your vlogs and miss them so much❤
So happy for youuuu!!!!
your dad and I have the same birthday!
When Morgan wins, WE ALL WIN!!! May September make all our dreams come true ❤
🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼

I’m so excited to see your vlogs/videos in this home. I know this house has been a lot but I can’t wait for you to fall in love with it again🖤
I know I'm not crying over walls with you. 😂😂❤❤❤
Girl I can't even imagine the amount of money you have put into this house!
Okay but i need to know the names of the songs you used because they were amazing
Music in this was a vibe. So happy to see this! Forever sad I only know you through the internet. Congrats sis!
Morgan would actually be phenomenal at podcasting. She can literally talk about anything, she's funny, and just overall entertaining
Wouldn't solar have fixed your power problem?
OMG YOUR HAIR LOOKS SO GOOD
Drywall these days? 😬It's so soft and doesn't breathe😫
Please fix that walkway. I would hate it if you or one of your family members or even the work crew tripped on that unevenness.
Morgan I'm so excited you have walls! I can't wait to see the kitchen go in. I have my fingers crossed that the rest goes smoothly for you and the government doesn't hold up this build any further.
I’m so proud and happy for you!!! I’ve been following all your journey and I’m so so happy! You are a warrior 💪🏼💪🏼
Morgan is so beautiful
Cant wait till you get to decorate your home for xmass and be there living it
Really nice light there, Morgan 😍

All the money you spent I would of bought a new house.
This has to be the longest house rehab I've ever seen. It's never ending.
Girl we’ve been watching!! I’ve never been so happy for someone like I’m about to cry too🥲 we’ve got walls baby!!!

Morgan make it handicap accessible so when you are old you can get around if you need a wheelchair

It’s gonna be so insanely gorgeous Morgan! I can’t wait to see it!
Morgan, bestie….If you ever move from this house, I sweaarrrr 😅
I’ve been a part of this journey since the beginning & I shed a tear to see the dry wall being placed. It’s been such a journey & I am hella proud! ✨Ahhhhhh, so excited. I cannot wait for the day for when you upload the “My house is done bitches”. 😂🙌🏼👏🏼 Will be a great day x
I feel so much joy and excitement and I don’t even live here 😭 it’s been so long in the making, it’s crazy I remember when you first moved to Cali and now you’re building your dream home ❤️ Edit: our dads share a birthday 😂❤️

Feeling like a proud sister! Seeing walls and not skipping ads for this girl! 🥹🩷🤘🏼
WALLS 😃😃😃😃😃
this journey has been a journey
I gotta say it Morgan, I have been watching religiously since the beginning…. YEARS ago and when I say how PROUD I feel watching you get these walls up. 👏👏👏 It looks beautiful so far! 💕
I dated, got engaged, graduated college, married, moved, started a job, and now pregnant while you’ve been building this house. That puts into perspective just how long a journey you have been on. So happy to see the end in sight and the BEAUTIFUL house you finally get to have.
When it’s all done, you need to do a house warming party and invite all who were a big part of it all ❤
💕
what is the song at 15:32?
We love you and we are so proud of you, Morgan!
House is looking great. Thank you for sharing your progress.  Can hardly wait until the next update..
Congratulations!!!! I can't imagine how relieving this is
Your house is going to be amazing and thanks for sharing your journey!!! I love watching your videos!!
Why am I crying over walls? Lol so glad for you. What a journey it has been
Im so happy for tou
I am so happy for you Morgan!
Aw another episode of how you’re the victim of everything 😢 poor you
Dude I have never been more excited for someone to get walls!! Finally!!! Congrats and please keep sharing the progress of your home, it’s going to be so beautiful❤️❤️ I remember when you started this journey, and I am soo determined to stick around and see the end result! Much love💗
Girl you look great!
I seriously cannot wait to see the finished product! So happy for you bestie!!
Just me judging by watching you and Bryan (or Brian), I think you guys, and maybe his sidekicks, might be friends for life. You guys just really seem to be sincopado. I hope so because that would be so cool. Anyway, you said that you "don't deserve all this good stuff" but everyone deserves the good stuff and to be happy, and that includes you. Congratulations on finally having walls, and I can't wait to see how the next stage of your house goes. 💗
Awh...Morgan!! ❤ it's getting done and it looks beautiful. You made me cry to see how excited you are. Congrats!!
She’s Morgan Wallin’ now lol😊
Please watch a season of Grand Designs to feel more in good company. "We think it's going to be done by this time next year I think."... Three Years Later. " Well, we finally got the planning........"
Yay!!! Finally
It’s my birthday month September is amazing  Sept 12,1990
why does Bryan not know that flies rub their grubby hands together ????
at least you look so good Morgan!!! that haircut 😍
Looks like a bunch of insulation wasn't put in the walls
SO HAPPY FOR YOU 💖✨
Congratulations Morgan!!💛💛 you deserve some good 🙏🏻🙏🏻
whats crazy is morgan saying she doesnt deserve it...the house and the moment and the walls lol but she so so so fkn does. ilysm
It’s been so long that you’ve wanted this! So proud of you ❤
I can not wait for the move in video! That is going to be an amazing day!
You are looking so much better! Glad that you are healing and that your house is moving along! Those guys have been so helpful. I’m go glad that you found this crew!
❤❤❤
omigod! we've made it!
girl! yes you deserve this!!
I've been following this journey since the beginning and let me just say I could feel your happiness in this video through the screen. <3
I think u should never had done this house project.😮😇
It's the realization that you're so much closer and seeing visually that you're almost to the finish line of being able to live in your HOME. I'm so excited for you.
wow I remember when you lived in Shane and Ryland’s extra bedroom and on air mattress and now you’re here! you go girl!
WE HAVE WALLS Y'ALL!!! 🥳🥳🥳
Why should we pay because we art alive? our beating hearts somehow attracting debt. The woods someday were flocked with queens and knights- their lineage is slouching at a desk. How does it cost so much to rinse your  face? The wealthy maelstrom lotion on their cheeks, but once a pond our cupping fingers raked and felt the trail of colder water leak.  Let’s let the sea become our hair’s shampoo, and let companies like Atlantis fall. Refreshed and free, let’s dunk ourselves into the jetting sea, the tide’s romantic crawl.  O, vital waves us human beings deserve. Like knights, let's slay those who profit from thirst.
Your so close to finishing it im so excited to see the end result ❤️
My mother told me helping me for garage sale.
Your house is actually gorgeous
That drywall glow!! Congrats morgan ❤❤❤❤
You've truly found the right people for this job, Morgan. When I watch these videos, it's such a labor of love on everyone's part. I see the care behind every step being completed and I am so happy for you. You finally found the right people to match how much you care about this house and do the job right. <3 It's been cool to see it all come together.
Me screaming OMG Morgan finally has walls!!! 😱 Hubby: silent/blank stare 🙄 Oh well I’m so happy for you Morgan! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
You’re coming into the final stretch, dear. Brass ring time…❤😊
I'm so happy for you morgan

It's looking great ❤  I've been invested in your journey since you arrived back in LA at your brother's place, so a few years now! And I'm so pleased to see things going RIGHT for you with your beautiful home. I hope you got your money back from the first company who screwed you over? Also, hoping your health is OK. Sending much love from this 50 year old British girl who STILL hasn't figured things out. Xxx

Walls
Does anyone else feel some cute chemistry coming from construction lad? I’m so happy this is coming along! And so happy to see Morgan so happy :) it’s looking beautiful and the relationship you’ve developed with the team is so sweet and speaks to how nice of a person you are.
That feeling is so nuts! We just finished our new home too, we started in 2020. It will all be worth it in the end!!
Your contractor is amazing!! And fly hands is the best thing I’ve ever heard😂😂😂
Girl I swear I say this every video but you looking so good so glowy I love it sm
When he said thata girl the first time… anyone else 😅🥵
I am so invested, do not give up oh my god.
Genuinely so happy to see this for you. It looks beautiful.
„It wouldn’t be because of you.“ that was so cute🫣 get your happy ending girl🥳
Does anyone knows what is the song title when morgan was on house the house when she was emotional about the walls? She didnt put it in the description box
Morgan gets more & more beautiful every video. Gorgeous!
"A diamond doesn’t start out polished and shining. It once was nothing special, but with enough pressure and time, becomes spectacular" — Solange nicole
Okay but why am I crying. I’m so happy for you ❤️❤️ 17:30
Not me tearing up for you!! You’ve been through so much but your dream home is almost here!!
Yayyyyyyyy
Still shipping Sam and morgan
Brian was heaven sent!   He was the exact support that you needed!   Contractor/heart caregiver.
YAAAY walls! *hugs*
Building a house is like a metaphor for building your life. Brick by brick, beam by beam, the foundation for anything is built one step at a time. I'm so happy for you Morgan 😊
Our girl finally has WALLS! ❤
Morgan I cried watching this!! I’m so happy for you♥️
I think all of us that had gone with you through this whole process we should deserve to attend your house warming party 😅 I cannot believe it has been that many years😢 I am literally crying because of your dry walls going up 😢
Morgan ALL the bullshit will be worth it, it's coming together and I'm so excited like it's not even my house and these walls got me in my feels lol, I have indeed been on this journey along with you, yayyyyyy, love you! ♥️✌️😭🥹
Literally 30s into the video but I just have to say I still absolutely love the short hair on you
It pains me that you don’t think you deserve the house - you’ve put so much effort into this project so I’d say you wholeheartedly deserve this.  From one homeowner to another, I hope all goes smoothly and I am glad the inspections have been completed.   Also, I know it’s hard to envision this now, but try to get some separation from the house once it’s done, try to get back to yourself and pursue your passions…a house is a physical structure after all, and things can happen to physical structures.  I’m just saying, I’m all for a podcast, school, family whatever gets you back to a productive, mentally complete You.  Congratulations, Morgan 🎉
Your mom and grandma holding hands 😭😭😭😭😭🥰
You absolutely DO deserve this! The house is going to be so beautiful, just like you! ❤️
Praise Bryan & his team
I absolutely love youuuuu!!! You are so Beautiful!!!🫶🏼🫶🏼
The drywall phase is so exciting. You can really see it start to come together
Been here since day one! So happy for you, keep smashing it! 💖
I sm so happy for you
Wait was that Lucas… flirting? “It wouldn’t be because of you” 🥰
MORGAN!! i keep you and your house in my thoughts like all the time - your house is going to be soo worth the wait i wish you nothing but positivity and happiness this fall x
I love this family. How does one become adopted 🤔?
It makes my heart so happy your so close to your grandma cherish every moment you only have them for a short time I miss my grandma sooo much
It’s gonna b awesome once done!
So happy for you Morgan! I can't wait to see the progress. It  is my dream to have a beautiful house like yours. Congratulations on this beautiful house. Love you Morgan
Yay fantastic! ❤😊👏
It’s coming together!
This is how I wanted to feel about my house but I’m end of terrace so I get to hear my neighbours constantly 😢 UK living
Your team are the absolute best! It’s so nice to see them all be a part of the vlogs and their personalities are the best! YASSS to walls!!! And I literally teared up watching you be so happy about the walls! Yup!!! And can I say how much I love the Adams family?  Legends!
Grandma♥️
Im so so happy for you Morgan! House looking good, will look even better once done, cant wait to see that.
the best news to wake up to. so happy for you hunny
why did i start crying when i saw the walls 😭😭
@26:45. This struck me. Feeling deserving. Riding on Shane's coat tails, maybe. But this made me SEE you. You are worthy young lady. ❤  To clarify, everyone judges. You might feel you had a free ride. I have such an amazing husband I often feel this way. Being blessed is indescribable, but I don't have all the answers to why. I judge like anyone else but this comment made me realize your worthy. Just a human, caring, young girl. Enjoy your new home.   My first home (such an accomplishment) has fallen to repair. As we get older it's hard to maintain. Even with 2 men and myself. It's a small home too! But you will learn my love.  I nvr comment but whatever yo. Enjoy your time girl. 🎉
So so satisfying to finally see walls! And to witness to how happy this makes you. ❤️ great vid!! Skylar is a savage with the shots and the editing is top tier 😁
really happy for u morgan u did it lets gooooo🎉🎉🎉🎉 and ur living ur doing it girl ur like a big sister to me

Not many people will realize the importance of putting up walls in a home....Morgan, your doin' it girl! Congrats on being that much closer to your destiny! I love your grandma...you guys remind me of being at home. Good job!
The house will look amazing! Grandma is so sweet, so happy to see this video, it made my day! ✨
Isn't it just the best to have walls! Our renovation has walls and it's amazing to wake up too ❤

You deserve every lovely and magical thing Morgan.
i didn’t screw you up for nothin 🫶🏻
yo I know a degarmo...
I haven't really seen anyone mention this, but the sheer quality of Morgan's videos is sooo impressive.🥺 The staging, lighting, editing.. They are like little cinematic masterpieces.😍
I LOVED this video. You’re family are all diamonds! I lost my grandpa nearly 2 months ago and he was my best friend my entire life, seeing your nan light up when she saw your home… I felt so peaceful. Cherish the moment that you have created 🤍 you should feel so incredibly proud of yourself girl
Bryan is gold ❤ fighting the county and all
Is your thing the house that never gets done 😂😂😂
So happy for you Morgan!!! So excited to see what it looks like next week! ❤
Morgan do you wear a good sunscreen on your shoulders, arms, chest and back? It seems like you've been wearing nothing but sleeveless crop tops since your surgery and you spend a lot of time in the sun
I'm fine, I didn't start crying at the sight of actual walls 😂 It's been a long time coming and omg I'm excited for the house to become more of an actual house, and proud of that lovely supportive team, and so so happy for you Morgan!!
Morgan, my love, no hate BUT… YOU DO DESERVE THIS! Embrace it. What’s meant for you won’t pass you by. Love you
I can't wait for the finished house tour! 😊
How often should we be expecting new video updates 🥹🫶🏽 I’ve been with this journey with you and I’m soooo excited for you!
Congratulations,  Ms. Morgan. You are making a house a home. 🤍🤍🤍
Your house is going to be amazing!
“Atta girl”….. 🥵
beautiful!!!! so happy for you Morgan :)
Oh beautiful lady, you so deserve it and much much more!
Listen, my spouse and teenager would love it if I left. Lemme come be your assistant. These hoes can take care of themselves while I'm gone....😊
I’m so happy for you finally ❤❤
I am so proud of you Morgan 🥹 for me that is a dream come true to have your own home sweet home.

WALLS!!!! For all of us that have been on this WHOLE journey with you, this videos brings SO much happiness!! Morgan, you deserve the world!! You’ve had a rough 2 years and you truly deserve this and I can’t wait to see the big reveal of your finished home. Blood, sweat and tears truly went into this.  Lots and lots of love, from the UK! ❤❤❤
You deserve this so much xx I can't stop smiling xx
When I saw the title for this video I got the biggest smile on my face!! I'm so happy for you!!!! ❤❤
not them touching insulation with their bare hands
Yayyy!!!!! <3
morgon!!!! im so happy for you! literally crying rn
Oh Morgan, I missed you so much 😢
i gasped and my jaw DROPPED at the title. congrats morgan🥹
I’m so happy her place is finally moving along. Just thinking about her paying a mortgage for 3 years in a house she doesn’t live in, rent when she was apartment bound, and contractor fees on top… as well as regular monthly bills/living expenses is crazy. If I was her I would’ve been uploading every week making that coin. But glad she’s lined herself up to not be in that position. 👍🏼
I'm So Happy for U, Babe!!!!!!
i love u morgan! im building my house too, that feeling when they put walls is insane! im crying!
That little interaction with grandma where she promised to come over kinda made me tear up, she’s so precious. 🥹💕
Morgan what camera do you use?
Did nana just spill the tea?????
Grandma !!!!! ❤❤❤❤ I missed her !!
Love, love. Who are the music artists you’re playing? The one who sings “you are the love, I can show you how to start to find your way…”!!
Congrats Morgan it's finally moving along
You’re so lucky to have your Grandma close and in your life. My Grandma is 97 with dementia and I miss her every day. Cherish every moment.
You have been through so much.. you deserve this more than you know.

Omg Morgan… I think I’ve cried enough tears for you in one night…. on your behalf. Yeah… you stay strong and I’ll be over here doing all the crying for you Lol.  Oh my goodness… I am so overjoyed for you and that things are finally beginning to move. I’ve been in prayer for you and just telling God to hurry the process up with these people holding everything up. And here we are… WALLS!! Oh man… I wish there could be an entire video on This Old House on how your house was made. How the floor plan was created, the building process, the construction, the design, the lighting, the flooring, the paint, all of it. I can’t wait to see how it looks at the end. But… one day at a time. Im glad you never stopped fighting. It’s all smooth sailing from here. Congrats Morgan!
THE TRANSITIONS!! 🥹 too flipping cute!!
Morgan's house got walls......i'm gonna tell my kids this is Morgan Wallen
i can’t wait to see how she decorates she’s going to be so excited
That whole fly thing was so funny 😂
Don’t cry on when you do the final video. Just present the future. Or skip the recap and show her decor videos
The way I involuntarily belly screamed for you when I read the title !! 🥰😂
I want Morgan to marry one of these dudes
the good news about having a house is that it will never, ever, EVER be done. there is always going to be something!

You don't deserve this?!? It's been three years of PAIN. As someone a few years older who grew up in trades, and has seen the start to finish of a house; I am SO impressed with you. Anyone would have given up, with experience. You fkn go girl. 🎉❤

This was a full cinematic masterpiece. Morgan. You are my favorite YouTuber and you keep getting better and better. So happy for you !
where are your sunglasses from?
I never expected to get emotional over walls, but here we are. So happy for you Morgan!
Wait till you get the tax bills. You never really own it trust me. Unfortunately I know😩. Sending you all the best vibes & prayers!💜
Congratulations!! i love when you post
We’re going to need so many design/decorating/shopping vlogs
I can’t wait to see a full house tour! I feel like we’ve all been on this journey with you 😅
Lots of love to you Morgan 💕
NGL, I was not expecting the circular driveway nor the number of trees. So sick!
Yes to NEXT WEEK!!! I can’t wait for the official house tour! ❤
I smiled throughout this whole vlog. Grandma is a whole vibe. She is just the sweetest to you Morgan. I know it can be hard staying with your parents, but cherish the moments there with them. These will be the last moments you hang your hat there. I know you have moved about before, but this time it is more real. So love on your people.  Good luck, and just like people say when someone graduates...YOU (and the crew) DID IT!!!!
I'm really happy for you Morgan. :)
can we just take a moment to appreciate Morgan's editing style ✨️👌🏻
The video of a million snaps!! 🫰🏻
I'm so happy for you Morgan that things are starting to progress more smoothly now for your house.  You'll be moving in before you know it!
OMGGGG IM SO EXCITED FOR YOU
I’m so emotionally attached to this house
Birthday twins w your dad💞 11 is the best day of may 😅
Finally getting walls is such a huge deal! Im so happy for you! I've watched every video along the way and im so excited for you to be so close to finally calling your house a home! ♥
14:06 the way I gasped so loud at the gym. 💛 even if just friends, that was such a nice thing to say. 👀
love u morgan!
Lowkey guys... i'm feelin the chemistry between Morgan and Lucas XD Love it
Idk how you make your videos so entertaining but you sure do. Your personality and editing and storytelling is so good. Unlike anyone else
I didn’t realize your driveway is a circle that’s pretty iconic
STOP TELLING YOURSELF YOU DON’T DESERVE THIS!!! You have been through so much and continued to push through to make your dream come true. I’m so happy for you!
Hi Morgan, I love your pearl bracelet!! Just wondering where you got it from? Also congratulations, what a milestone with your house! I am so excited for you!!
Love you Morgs!!!!
What is the big building across from the barn?  Is that also a house?
The boys have been working overtime! ❤
Grandma is spilling some tea 🤣🤣
I might actually cry when we get a new house tour video!
Seeing you genuinely happy about this house for the first time since you bought it… I’m so proud of you! You’ve come so far with this obstacle and you conquered it! I cried seeing you so happy about the walls. Never in my life 🤣 but i am here for this 🖤
So who is the room mate? 🤔😊
Big things baby!!!!
I think god gave you Brian - if that’s his name. The contractor. You needed him. Even tho it took forever his mentality keeps his team and his customers going.
MORGAN!!!! I missed you so much girly 🥺🩵 I love this so much for you
I am so happy for you sweet girl! You deserve nothing but the best! Thank you for allowing us to come along on your journey. Sending you lots of good vibes!

Glad u alive we need more blogs plzz❤
thank you brian
I'm so happy for you. thank you for sharing with us.
I'm so happy you're getting walls. I also bought a fixer-upper home out in the country, and the hard things I'm dealing with are plumbing and trying to get internet. Also, my birthday is May 11. Now I know I share it with one cool dude 🎉
Your looking so good girl!!! Now all we need to do is find you a hubby
So happy for you!
23:29-23:39 who's the roommate!?
3:40 where have I heard that saying on th wall before? 😅😅
Your content gives me life
The toughest part will be parting your ways from your friendship and partnership with contractors once the house is complete 😢
Hellllll yeah! We LOVE walls.
Congrats on the walls!!!!!!!!!!
I just came from seeing an apartment... I just want a home!! This will be my 33rd move 🥺🤦‍♀️ Thank you for the good home vibes!
it's so crazy to see ur house with walls! it's been a hell of journey to get here! i can't wait to see what it looks like when it's completely done
You’re so lucky to still have your grandma miss mine every day 💔
The editing, color grading, music!!! Its a whole production and gets me inspired to edit my self!!!!!
I feel the joy through the video in Morgan makes me tear up a little 😢 also I love how cute your grandma is makes me appreciate being able to see mine twice a year when she visits ❤
Poor Lucas came in hot with that one liner and Morgan acted deaf 😂 he so sweet
Looking so skinny🤠yes girl
12:29 love it 😂😂
Morgan are you going to have them over for the first dinner and hangout after the house is done?!?!?
I bought a 115yr old house and have been slowly restoring it and the scene of the sunset on the walls PERFECTLY encapsulates the feeling of standing back, seeing your work, feeling home. I’m so happy for you Morgan, you’re getting close to the finish line!!  Houses are never “done” but the odd jobs will be passion projects, not huge hurdles like this! You’ve done so well!! ❤️
I’m so happy for you, you didn’t give up even when it was hard and that’s amazing. I’m proud of you, you deserve to be happy🩷

“Well it wouldn’t be because of you.” 🥺🥺
Morgan’s vlogs are always a vibe 🙌🏼
Thank goodness for Brian and the boys!! I'm going to be sad when everything is done. I hope you stay in contact with them, and have them over to your finished home for some videos. However, I can't wait for your house reveal video. I'll probably cry with you, because I've been following this journey with you from the beginning, and I know how crazy it's been. I'm so pumped for the final product.
Ok, but why did this almost make me cry? 😢 So happy for you Morgan

Buckle up for happy days to rain on ya, it is time. So glad to see that sunshine for you.
PODCAST YES YES DO ITTT
Some people would call that walls, others cardboard… not to be shitting on anyone in specific, I just don’t get American houses.
I hope your dry wall lady Jacquelyn is the ex wife of the man who is doing our home in COSprings.. he bragged about how she is the queen and he taught her all she knew. He said they are better separate than apart but he talked about her for 5min when doing a bid on our home and it was honestly the best and I hope if anything happens to me and my husband he walks around and brags about me to total strangers.
Sooo happy for you!!!
so dammm proud of you. i know how hard it’s been on you and i’m so happy to see things finally working out for you ilysmmmm
Girl since everything is coming together beautiful that should mean that you are going to be posting me cause I miss watching you and your family 🥲❤️

Just waiting on the day she gets so board living there and she moves back to a LA penthouse
Pausing at the Home Depot part to go into Home Depot for plumbing supplies 😂😭 I’m crying with you. My husband and I started building in 2020 and he’s done most things and we’ve paid for it out of pocket which is what has took us so long but I’m so excited and happy for you Morgan. You deserve all the happiness and to be in your home!
You are such a beautiful soul. And so beautiful inside and out. I'm so happy to see you so happy 😊
Yes! Walls!! ❤
I can’t wait for the day Morgan gets married! It’s going to be “I haven’t been this happy since the day my house got walls!”
“time for a pepsi!”  *drinks a sprite*
Congratulations it is going to be beautiful ❤
Her admiring the walls and with that background music just made me emotional as heck. I'm so proud of witnessing Morgan go from chaotic camping trips to this.
…I think Lucas should be your roommate. 👀😬
So move in before Christmas?
So excited for you Morgan! Finally!❤🎉
Im so excited to see the next vlog!!!!! Painting! Everthing is looking up!
I hope it’s all done before Christmas so you can have an epic family holiday party at your house.
I am so proud of you Morgan! Your house looks really great and its so nice to see how happy and involved your construction team is. You're almost there!
I love this!!!!!! But wait... Not Grandma Janice almost spilling some tea on who your roommate is !!!!
I’m so happy the house is finally coming together now, ive been invested in the journey for years, finally starting to look like a home
Oh girl if Anyone deserves a completed house it's You. You deserve This 💯💯💯💯❤
When the wall lady was talking about how you will feel when it’s complete made me cry in happiness for you before I’ve even seen the results, because it is sooo damn true it’ll feel like a home
Morgan you have walls girl 🎉🎉 I’m so happy for you, I watch this project form day one 😊 I don’t own my house but I’m thrilled for yours ❤❤❤ can’t wait to see colours and floors 💜☺️
so very happy for that win 4 you.
I love seeing you so happy 🥰 I will watch the full length of all the ads in your videos so you can continue to succeed!
U should come to 2nd street in Denver it’s basically In store thread up
Do not EVER say you don't DESERVE your house!! You have worked way too hard not to get your reward of pride and satisfaction of your home. I watch a lot of YouTube, and I see people build a home and renovate them, all so slick and shiny. You are raw and real. The things you have faced during this construction are a dose of what really can happen. I appreciate you showing how the good,  bad, and the ugly of life may become sometimes. Just sharing your heart and soul in such a daunting build is such a beautiful gift to all of us, Morgan. You 100% deserve it all! ❤
I need that gif from Rachel Greene that says: “I’m going to have walls!” ❤
Yesss, girrll 👏👏👏👏
I love the amount of house work and doctor’s appointments Morgan can afford when only posting like once a month if that…posting GOLD every time, not dissin. I would like to thank THRED UP, BETTERHELP AND ALL THE SPONSORS OF THIS WONDERFUL REAL WOMAN.
I am SO fucking excited for you!!
Yay!!!!
Im so proud of you Morgan - its been a tough road but you have done it ❤
They put the walls up on my birthday MORGAN!!!!❤❤❤❤
So happy for you Morgan!
Somehow catching a video here or there or seeing you on your Brother, Brother in law's videos... I've got invested in you. I want the best for you. I'm 55 and I'm still learning. You're a bird that landed in the water, you can't control the ripples or waves... even the calm, peaceful water. If you try, you'll forget you ever flew. Don't try to control the weather, learn to let go and roll with it, "this too shall pass". The sun will come out and dry your wings and you'll fly again. Wishing you love and light.❤🥰😘
Not me crying about a stranger's drywall. Sooo happy for you!!! 🥳
I am SO HAPPY for you!!! The progress has been amazing.
is it too late to add an elevator or escalators for Grandma? lol
I’m so happy for you Morgan! One step closer to your house finally being done. I’m sending you and your house all the positivity I can muster so that everything else from here on out is smooth sailing ⛵️✨
With all due respect the “attagirl” did something for me hahahaha so proud of you Morgan ❤

So happy for you Morgan!!❤
Morgan, we are sooo proud of you and the team for fighting for this house!! Thanks to your Team your house is soo close to the finish! Well hopefully its close i know things move slow BUT!!! WALLS!!!  Also tip for scars -  if it bothers you, and your scar is fully healed you can use scar bandages that help it lighten and smooth it down. I used it as a kid when i had multiple surgeries
OMG Im so happy for you Morgan! My eyes started watering when I saw you looking at the drywall. The journey was rough but you're close to the finish line. 💜
I almost cried literal tears in my eyes when I saw the walls!! It’s absolutely beautiful you deserve it Morgan!! Xoxox

i love how happy you seem, im so happy you can see what the future is bring for you
I mean your scar, oops
Omg I clicked so fast. I was just thinking about you yesterday and hoping everything after surgery was going well, so I’m so happy to see you back!!!

I’m so happy or you Morgan, it just makes my heart so happy to see that finally all the stress, pain, blood and tears are paying off. Congratulations on your walls girl. 🎉❤
I am so invested in seeing this house finished!! I know you will be in pure disbelief once you can move in and LIVE GIRL! CONGRATS ON THE WALLS!!🎉
I would die for a podcast with you and your grandma. I could listen to her all day, and your relationship is EVERYTHING.
🎉🎉 congratulations babygirl 😚 I am so happy and excited for you and sending hugs 🤗 positive thoughts💭💭 and prayers 🎉🎉
😂😂😂 I cover county court stuff, and it is so mind-numbing—especially the business side of things. Don't even get me started on business flags and signs.
You deserve this more than anybody else! And also YOU ARE GLOWING! Go team Morgan <3

Morgan, you look so snatched and beautiful
i'm so happy for you!  your house is going to be stunning, gorgeous, just like you! 🥰
Um...did Grandma almost let something out of the bag, saying you already have a roommate? Lucas maybe! That would be THE BEST ending to all of this!!!
Camera man understood the assignment
I’m just here for grandma .. she reminds me so much of my grandma who retired in colorado around family 🫶 now special to have so many videos with her and her warming smile
I’m happy for you Morgan. You get pushed down and you get back up! You are inspirational and I’m wishing you the best:)

Not me tearing up you when you saw your walls!🥲
This is the first time I’m going to leave a upset comment. Morgan, how dare you.  HOW DARE YOU SAY THAT YOU DO NOT DESERVE THIS. BECAUSE YOU ABSOLUTELY DO. It’s been great seeing all the progress and thank you for bringing us along for the journey! We’re happy to see you happy!
this is oddly specific but I am so jealous of your arms, they're perfect

Actually started tearing up during the first shot of the walls in the house, you just looked so proud and happy 🥹 I'm so happy for you that this is finally coming together!!
I drank 12 shots of vodka watching this 😂❤❤❤
Yesssss bitch we love walls!!!
This team was meant to come into your life for a reason. As terrible as the process was getting here, Bryan and his guys are basically the definition of found family ♥
Why am I literally crying over WALLS😭🎉
this is HUGE! honestly so proud of you for sticking to this and so happy for you that you get to finally see this become a reality!! 💗
I’m so overjoyed to see Morgan’s house coming along ! I missed her so much I was rewatching her blogs for a month wondering when this girly was going to fed us good tonight 😭I’m glad she’s back😭😭😭💕
Congrats girl 🥰
10:28 you look so pretty!

I’m so happy for you. I do hope you start a podcast. Can’t wait to see more ❤
Oh my God I'm so excited for you it is about time girl you have waited forever. Love to see you so happy
14:07 “well it would be because of you” what a sweet thing Lucas said. I bet that’s their favorite place to work at.

Oh Morgan 😭♥️
Morgan I love you and your videos and I’m sooooo happppy your house is coming together it’s been hard for you and for us to see you going through the hard times with your house but I’m so happy everything worked out and you have fuckin walls!!!! Lol it’s amazing
Been watching the whole time now and I'm so happy for youuuu🎉 congrats 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Go girl go girl🎉❤
I'm so excited for you. Congratulations 🎉
this whole process is gonna be so worth it, I’m so happy for you🥺
I have a difficult time visualizing spaces unless there are walls, so it's extra exciting!   Major milestone.
26:45 Morgan, don't say that! You deserve it the most!
Yaaaay I'm so excited for decorating videos and lol design videos it's going to be so cuteee
i’ve been on a jury for the last 4 weeks and that intro gave me flashbacks
You totally deserve a finished house 😅.  No one else would be smiling at this point.   Congratulations on your walls!  You go Girl! 🎉❤
Can't wait til it's done, for ypu!!  and me😉
Morgan!!!!Where did you get the awning above your sliding doors for your barn?! 🙏🙏🙏
[it looks like a dirty nasty mess. This is why people buy ready-made homes like Ryland and Shane. Maybe the decor is a little bit off but it wasn't a Brady Bunch home with an 1970's Arby's out back.]
your parents keep the temp at 83 degrees that should be illegal 😎
First stairs then walls 👏 I'm so happy for you, Morgan! 🎉
The government must be brick fans... They saw you paint those suckers and immediately decided you could not be trusted with a whole house
The stick house, is now a walled home🥹
Going to tag you on this video when you put stick house on the market 😂
🥹🥹🥹🥹
If you had a podcast I would 10/10 would 100% watch and love it!
Is Sam married? Cause... wife him up, Morgan!!! The way he looks at youuu
💜💜💜💜💜
😮😭😭😭😭
Omg Morgan! I’m so excited to see everything come together now! 🎉
Hey just wanted to tell you that I loves you girly! And your doing a great job 👍🏻😁😊❤❤❤
SO HAPPY FOR U MORGAN !!!!!!!!!
When we started building this home ,, it was rough and a struggle but so worth it!! Raised 3 kids now 3+ grandkids that come and enjoy our pride and joy!! Shes a great home. We will die here😂 so proud of you . 😊 its a beautiful home!
Morgan, with all my heart, congratulations on getting to this point in your home remodel.  We've all watched your struggles and know this has definitely been a hard road for you.  Nothing, but blue sky's from now on.....  🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤
Do you want to hear the nightmare that I am going through with my building department here in Nevada!? Apparently 28 years ago when we bought this godforsaken property, they didn’t file the final paperwork to do the conversion for the manufactured home we purchased. All this time we thought it was converted to real property and little did we know it was still considered a goddamn trailer. Then the lady decided to go on Zillow and look at our listing because it’s for sale. That’s when she started nitpicking and saying. Is that stucco on your home that I see??? Did you have a permit for that??? You’re not allowed to put that on a trailer! oh, and do I see that there’s a metal roof!? Oh, you’re not allowed to have a metal roof on a manufactured home. And is that a brand new air conditioner that I see in those pictures??? Did you get a permit for that??? And the list goes on I am ready to drive all the way up to Carson City grab that woman by her hair and pull her all the way back down here where I live and southern Nevada and smashed her face into my tree in my front yard. So I understand your frustration 110,000%.😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 PS. Your home is turning out to be so beautiful. It’s going to be so worth everything you went through. I’d also like to add you look beautiful as well. Please update us on your melanoma. ❤ Sending you lots of love from southern Nevada.
when they said 24 weeks LOL
The fact that both of our houses are starting to see process on the building has me so emotional
im so happy for you morgan!(:
I liked it better without walls. JUST KIDDING.  (Congrats!)
[Poor Megan, buys a white Elephant house then gets a skin carcinoma on her boob. Lives with her mother who takes care of the grandmother. Take out those stupid stairs and put in a Home Elevator so Janice doesn't have to break her neck on the stars when you have a sleepover.]
Yaaaaaaas!! Finally!! SO pleased for you and you 110% DO deserve this, you could have bailed at the first hurdle, but you fought for this house!! ❤ x
We've all been waiting so long for this!!!! 🎉🎉
It would be rly cool to have a gallery wall of all the photos of the guys building the house and with you, that would be so freaking cool. ❤
How exciting! Now your house is starting to look like a house. You have went threw the storm & now out the other end. I’m so happy for you. ✌️💚🤗🤓
Waiting for the post of her and Lucas because I ship it !!!!!🥹🥹🥹🥹
I can’t believe it’s been 2 years. Holy shit.

The amount of happiness I feel for you 🫶🏻🫶🏻
LOVE this and your energy lady. Keep shining. You GOT this!
7:47 He is so encouraging!!!!
O girl dont tease us with a podcast. I would love that so much.....
I feel like you and this house were ripped down to the studs at the same time.  It's been an adventure watching both you and your stick home make so much progress over the last few years.  Strong as heck the pair of ya!  Is it weird to say I'm proud of you?  Yup... suee is. But who cares... keep crushing it yo!
Morgan you DO deserve this!!! I’m so happy for you and can’t wait to watch you through this journey to the end!❤️
So proud of you for hanging in for dear life al this time. Hopefully now you will get to all the good parts you deserve it!! Keep going girl you got this❤

Congratulations Morgan! I know this is a long time coming! I’m so proud of you for continuing after all the set backs! This is a huge step, and I’m one excited fan! Thank you, for all the inspiration you give to others including me. ♥️
MORGAN YOU LOOK GORGEOUS.  And girl! This is your forever home! You better stay there!
The way I’m crying over your walls 😭 I’m so happy for you!!!
Oh all of the evening glow on the walls is amazing. This part goes so fast in construction!! Very happy for you Morgan
Nah. Homedepot is not a man's world. It's a workers world. I'll walk in and know exactly where to go and my bf has no clue. If you're ever lost on where something is just use the app. Only time I asked for help was when I had to create a plumbing route for my lavadero. The man who worked there was super knowledgeable and most of what I needed was up high where I wasn't allowed to get stuff.
Sometimes it’s the journey that makes the destination worth so much more.  So happy for you.  Much love.
Hi you.... I just wanna say i really inspired by you and your work. I sooooo want start my YouTube channel and try to create content like yours. Really hope i do someday
You have always been beautiful but  you and your house had a major glow up!! Cause you seem so much more happy and excited 💕
"well it woudn't be because of you" omg too cute
Morgan I’m so happy for you! Also please start the podcast <3
Just FANTASTIC GIRL!!!✌😘
If you all are just friends I’m sorry about this haha but I’m shipping Lucas and Morgan 😂👏🏻💜
AAAAAAAAAA CONGRATS ON WALLS!!!!!!!! I've been hoping and praying for this day for you for your entire journey! <3 I can see it coming together... that golden hour light is fabulous. I can't wait to see the Morgan decorating diaries, and Morgan seasonal spritzing tales! I want to see you decorate for Halloween and Christmas and every other holiday!!! <3 I also can see you just handing out your smoothie drinks through that kitchen window! Hope you get the barn sturdy somehow, it can't be left to crumble!  Also I want a man in my life as dedicated as Brian is to getting you your walls. He's a gem, so is the entire team!  Can I be your roomie? I have a calico cat named Mara and I can bake. :o)
Congratulations!!! ☀️🥰☀️
You are absolutely my favorite YouTuber ❤ i look forward to every upload!
You need a Sam or Lucas in your life Aloha.

How’s your horse journey?
Why am I crying 😢❤
The way I screamed and did a happy dance and it’s not even my house 😂 IM SO HAPPY FOR MORGAN!!
Was grandma about to spill some juicy tea about Morgan’s roommate?!?
trap - don’t poison!! 🐁
As a 25 year old female who bought a 120 year old fixer upper, I relate so hard to Morgan and how happy the simple things are. Like for me it was when I got clean water and heating 😅
When the boys said “atta girl” when Morgan was lifting the tile 👀👀🙈
"time for a Pepsi" *Proceeds to drink sprite 😂😂😂
Lucas saying that if Sam hated working there it wouldn’t be because of you 🥺
This video make me so happy for u Morgan, 3 years and you finally have walls !!!!! I feel like a proud friend ! Thank you for sharing this journey with all of us
You can tell how much she’s going to appreciate this home once it’s done. Alll the pain will be worth it

This has been such a long and rocky journey for you, but Morgan your house is GORGEOUS! It's gonna be SO beautiful when it's finally done, and it's really coming along. I cant even imagine the sense of relief and pride you will feel when it's finally ready for move-in and your vision is complete after all this time. I know it has been so difficult with many challenges along the way, but it's totally gonna be worth it!  Also, your parents keeping their house at 83 literally made me gag 🤢🤣
Walls ❤❤❤
I don’t know why, but seeing Morgan posted a new video always gives me a little dopamine release.
Crying happy tears for you Morgan. Partially because I’m pregnant and extra emotional/sensitive but mostly because I’m soo happy for you! So glad your house is coming along nicely! 🫶🏻

All the crying and whining about walls was kinda annoying tbh and I feel like ur wearing tube tops to show off that scar. But with all that said looking forward to see the interior decorating hopefully with less cheesiness and tears.
Is trinity still moving in
YAYYYY WALLS 🙌🏻🥲
Yay! Ok I used to live on summit hill place. Using the back roads from parker I watched a peacock just walking down the road nbd. I laughed so hard
🥳🥳🥳
It’s been such a long time coming and such a huge mental battle for you too— I’m so happy to see how far you (and your home) has come ❤
Yayyy

Happy news!!!! Love your Grandma!!!!!🥰
💜💜💜💜💜💜
So who is this "roommate" Grandma referred to?  Are you hiding a boy in one of the closets?
Ive never been so HAPPY about err walls! ❤
U r a strong young lady for not giving up on all the struggles & chaos u have endured. Proud of u 👍💜
I have absolutely NO idea why but for some reason we always have our rises and falls at the SAME TIME, must be an August leo thing but I always find a massive comfort in watching you, so happy for you that you're back in your rising era!!! Remember that everything that falls must rise again at some point :) 💕💕💕💕
Finally! I really think once the walls are up, the last 5 minutes of (insert HGTV show here) are the fun parts - floor, paint, tiles, fixtures, decor. This will come together so fast. It BETTER come together so fast. 😂
Literally SOBBING in my car watching these walls go up! Morgan im so happy for you! You deserve every good thing coming your way ❤ thank you for taking us on this special journey and for never giving up on this god damn dream! We love you, and we cant wait to see the rest of this come together ❤❤❤
