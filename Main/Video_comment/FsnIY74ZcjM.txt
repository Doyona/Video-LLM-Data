Então a pessoa q disse que ligou depois do acidente mentiu ?
Você acabou de comprar uma McLaren e eu acabei de me inscrever no seu canal. 👍👍
Arrêtez de rigoler bêtement ! J’ai zappé au ca m’énerve !!
Noo,don't buy it!Noo,very bad, unrepairable
OMG YOU BOUGHT THIS FROM MY DADS JUNKYARD HAHHAHAHA
I just love the way this guy rolls!😂😂👍
What’s the point of the video without you telling us how much you bought it?
06:00 Nah watch the Nolan films and Batman (Bruce) drives a Lamborghini Murciélago roadster in the first film, a Murciélago LP640 in the Dark knight and then an Aventador LP 700-4 in TDKR! 🤔🤷🤣
Hi I love your work I wish I could meet you
What did he pay for it as I have no clue what "half of a used 720" goes for especially in the EU vs UK.
why does your channel always pop up on my auto play after all other videos i watch
Trying to turn it over without checking anything is your pattern... Very upsetting
Love see you and your dad fix the car very good bro love your video thank you❤❤❤❤❤ you the best bro keep going
So you went all the way to Holland and then decided to check CarVertical? The breaker's yard would have given you the VIN No over the phone.
This car is trash...
Bonjour, peux-tu activé la.piste audio française sur tes vidéos comme ceux de la gt3rs et le Ferrari ? Merci et bon travaille
Insurance catagory MA (Matt Armstrong) 🤣
Surely for an assessment that quick they could have judged via a photo
Oh man that’s a project!
Yikes, what are you gonna do now? Certified repair shop won’t touch it but it doesn’t mean it can’t be repaired
Shout out to dde 750gtr!!
Love the channel but you need to start selling some cars.
If only you never had Lego, keep up the good work
Looks like he calmed after the nip.
I'm 5 minutes in..... walk away Mat
Bro you know there’s dipsticks to check the oil right? 12:43
Its honestly kind of amazing how you guys repair these cars..  Im no mechanic in anyway,  just watching you take them apart is mind blowing... I tried to remove a dash from my car when i was younger to put in a radio and I couldn't get it back together so i rolled with a radio just flopping around... Im cool...
Yo, I was definitely waiting for them to put the thing up on jackstands or put it on a lift and look at it from underneath before buying it.
Coooovers
7:23. Soooo, Mat. What you are basically telling people right here is they should never buy a car from you... because all the cars that you showcase has had some severe crash damage in the past and then was rebuilt by you, who is, in your words on several occasions, not a professional.
They can fix it if they wants to it’s not in the intrest to do it. It’s just carbon fibre and glue
Osea compraron una chatarra, y uno aquí pobre sin carro..🥹🥹🥹
The country of Amsterdam?!? 😂
You need to write a book on how to maintain a positive attitude!  Talk about finding the plusses in a mountain of minuses!😃
The best way to get Mat to do something, is to tell him it can't be done. Works every time. 😁
make a car from that car, (take all out and change the exterior and enterior
Amsterdam is not a country big boy
Amsterdam isn't a country😉
Please put the audios in Brazilian Portuguese as well. 🙏🏼
Dutch not so honest after all?
Hahaha Verstappen slides in for a cameo  😂
Es estúpido pedir permiso para reparar algo q no sirve, si puede para q pedir permiso? Es estúpido ese proceso
Ended up beautiful though
love the car hate the color
Mat walk away m8
ahh yes the country of amsterdam
14:09 Porsche lol
...hy here is Fabio an Italian ho live in Germany ...Mat its so great what you do with your Father verry verry special ...grande quello che fai la tua passione per le Machine piu belle dell Mondo ti invidio...continua...ciao fabio
The ‘country’ is… Amsterdam. Lol
Love the "manufacturers" reference 😂
2 hour flight from the uk? 😂 did the plane detour Spain first lol
:)
Mat you must buy a crash damage G Wagon G 63 and rebuild it please
Better than drown in water.
6:00 caught me off guard
mat i live in the Netherlends and i love your videos
Annoying that they told him they had to see the car physically before saying if it was repairable by them…when they could have told him over the phone, any damage larger than X size is a no…wasted time and money bringing to a worthless body shop.
100% jack dohertys mclaren
I'm only 7 minutes into the vid, and yes Dutch people do tend to be trustworthy, except for those from Amsterdam, which is coming from me, a Dutch person... So I really hope this thing will turn out alright
Dutch squirrel wearing RBR racing gear 😂
17:09 the previous owners did not use valvoline oil
Love watching Mat and his repairs. So easy to watch. He explains everything clearly, and his cameraman does a sterling job. Unlike other car program presenters, he is not arrogant in the slightest, has a fab sense of humour, and on video at least he doesn’t have a potty mouth👍😜.
Is that not the car of dutch Dj Dark Raver?
haul the whole car there for 5s say mo and haul it back? A video or a video call would do, I would tell them to kick rocks bruh.
Mat, you are evidence that the universe and our reality can be bent to our will if your intention and desire are strong enough. Yo've built a 3M + channel and I imagine growing wealth just through hard work and determination. Mate you are a f*****g beacon to everyone. Namaste x
Should check things out before starting anything lol are A.D.H.D Matt you're a bit like me lol lol
Koenigsegg next 👍
ARISE SIR MAT AMSTRONG  ARISE MBE TONY  ARISE CBE HANNAH  I have seen people given SIR AND MBE FOR breaking Covid RULES OR FOR LOCKING UP POST MASTERS AND SUB POST MASTER.   Sir MATTHEW AMSTRONG ALL THE WAY
If Mat does all  his car repair with brand new clothes or not greasily overall, why mechanics around the world can't do that? I've never see him get mucky like other mechanics. You've change how mechanics shu'd be IMO.
Using car vertical doesn’t make sense unless insurance was involved. In later videos, Matt even points this out, how to get around car vertical.
My dream car 😂😂
I've never heard about a repairshop having to ask the manufacturer for permission to repair a car...
14:08 the porsche pyrofuse dig 😂
Ah, nice I just realized you made play-lists per car, love having your video's in the background while 3d modeling, keep it up!
Sell it for spares get ya money back
jes jes
That flash of the Porsche Shield at 14:10 had me crying 😂
Poor service from individual:sc - they could have told you prior the quantity of what they can repair. Poor. Waste of time.
"Dutch people do tend to be trustworthy" - proceeds to show a pic of Max Verstappen... 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The fact that a car loan travels with the car instead of written off from the previous owner is harsh
So they needed to see it in person but look at it for a split second and say "we can only repair this big" surely they could have seen that from the photos.
Wheres the oil coming from?  "The engine" 😂😂😂
When's the full build video coming to the second channel?
The country we’re flying to? Amsterdam 😂 1:04
Mat-"flying to another country" proceeds to say amsterdam💀😂
That batman logo has got to be one of the stupidest things I've ever seen lol.
So long as it's not flooded with sea water, you're all good.
Amsterdam is not a Country
You are mad dude :D:D
What did you do to the squirrels 🙃
Amsterdam is not a country.
Crazy 60k for that.... I would pay Max 15- 20k for that piece of shi.... Te😂😅
Hola mat por fa traducelos al español un abrazo desd colombia
You can fool some of the people some but not all the time
That Porsche emblem 😂
14:08 🤣🤣
bro who the hell was driving the car
Overall spent is like buying a used one
You might take a loss in the project but you'll still make money on the videos mate and you add to your collection ,learn a lot and teach us all is pissible when u have money, a YouTube channel and work hard. Thanku
As a dutch dude, thanks.❤  Keep it up kid!
I just think 'half the price of a good second hand one' is crazy when it is a write off, and considering the cost of repair.
I love how he puts a quick flick of the Porsche logo every time he talks about the pyro fuse. Poor man is traumatized for life after that GT3 😂
Most expensive squirrels nest 😂
Who saw golden Batman logo under the spoiler
man you've gotta learn when to say no, yet you always manage to pull of such amazing feats. how do you do it??
Bro did not say the country he flew to is Amsterdam... that was very American of him
Never buy cars from the Dutch
Dude I adore this channel
hi😊😊😊😊😊
Mat Armstrong Great Video I think it's absolutey insane that you flew to Amsterdam to buy that Wrecked 720s and I'm sorry to hear that Individual Specialist Cars won't fix it and I can't wait to see how you'll figure out how to fix it
Funfact the monocoks from McLaren are manufactured in Austria half an hour drive from my home😂
It would be good if you subtitled the videos in Spanish. 😢
The country we are going to… is amsterdam
Bros gonna make an amazing series like always
Bro is insane he's so good at everything he does that he can't be better that's my dream car as well
How long have I not had a device
That’s a leave it alone car.
Let's goooo ❤
Well...at least there is no rust lol
Whoever told you the Dutch are trustworthy dont take into account how much we like to make a good deal. Good deals don't have to be honest deals, hehe. This one looks okay though, great car, binging this right now en enjoying it!
Hey Mat! Love your videos but... Amsterdam is not a country bro.  Edit: Also, system was not in German but in French.
I DO NOT UNDERSTAN WHY PEOPLE TRY TO START CARS WITH A REAL RISK OF DAMEGE TO OIL SYSTEM OD UNKNOWN OIL LEVEL... It's so dumb to be hones... You are not dumb... So why are you doing it? ;-P  Fix it first, be sure of oil system status and oil level - then start it...
Amsterdam city ❎️ Amsterdam country ✅️
Hola mat llévame una vuelta desde argentina 🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷❤❤❤❤
Tony needs his own content channel!!
Starèr moèr?
Hahaha 🙂 The Mercedes in the CarVertical add looks better than the McLaren. So DON`T buy a wrecked car.
"Half the price of a used one" as it is only half a car you getting I would hope so😂
20:22 i’d immediately drive it back home to patch it and repair it 😅 not like it’s going to be driven at top speed.. a simple carbon fiber repair and off to the races
I bet a Dutch squirrel is the only type of squirrel that can’t remember where it buried it’s nuts 😵‍💫
please we want content about this project in you spanish acount!!! 🥺🥺
Seller is very happy with £60k for a piece of junk
Hey Matt wife and I love your channel love the cars you build and drive keep great work...Your dad is a great extension  of your channel hats off to him for his great insight
I broke a pencil today
Rebuild it 100 million views
💯 it was a no.....  Untill  Brownies!
I like how they made you bring it to them to "inspect" it when they could have just immediately told you no based soley on the size of the damage.
Country... Amsterdam? 🤔
why would you buy this buttered car?
Bit of t cut ,,and happy  days 😅
Hl desde colombia te escribo son muy buenos tus video te apoyo desde mi colombia hermoso 🎉❤
Your geography is very poor. Amsterdam is not a country LOL😂😂😂
What a guy u are , brought for 60k , , big risk is it ?? Who would want  to by this , would be 35 % below retail , so worth 95 k comoleted
Amsterdam is not a country 😂 you schould know better🇾🇪🤪
I am glad you were transparent on the price vs other YouTubers that gate keep
Mat my dad like’s ya where I Australia
Porsche, cough😂😂
he: its in german. also he: putting it from french to englisch xD
This is more existing than my favorite movie!  You guys are just amazing! ❤
Commenting for algorithm.
I mean you are braver than me matt I wouldn't have bought this one not gonna lie
Great video as usual. What's with the Porsche logo 14:09?
The fat guy automatically "NO" like dude have you seen Mat restorations? Lol  😂
I will paid 100 dollars
as a Dutch squirel it makes me proud to hear you think we are trustworthy ! Keep up the good work ! Greeting from the Netherlands
Amsterdam, what a country
This will never be more than a Frankenstein junkyard “supercar” with corners cut & severely devalued
tavarish did it first
Tavarish had a flood car. Thats pretty bad but the car was 80% intact. You literally need to replace 80% of everything. You would definitely be cheaper buying a complete car. I like optimistic car builds, but this is just stupid 😂
This car is pretty average even new... what are you talking about ? Don't believe those professional false claims, cooked lies, pirate faces selling big shit. Well this one looks problematic for sure, good luck.
The guy said the dealership ran the engine and tested the gearbox, how? Brake pressure and fuse weren't fixed, trans leaking, trust the Dutch?
The country we arrived in - AMSTERDAM! 🫠🫠🫠
he keeps saying "that's looking good" and im trying to figure out exactly what he's talking about. haha
Didn't see that coming
Amazing 😻 Mat and the other builders good luck. Can’t wait to see the McLaren being fixed 🎉❤
Left hand drive ! 🤮
At first glance my heart was beating, questions burning my tongue, what the fcuk happened?
Like you said this is very much like DDE McLaren 720 but sorry this one is far far worse 😬 good luck 🤞🏻
No expert... but the 1st 2 minutes of the Video showed to me... this McLaren should R.I.P...
1:06 so funny i never knew Amsterdam is a country😂
Facts. Amsterdam is not a country. And it doesn't take 2 hours to fly from Britain to Holland.thick barsteward
waist of time videoe
That will buff out
The country we are flying to.... Amsterdam
Best channel icl
Best Row model💯💯
Noice one der m8
You just fly to a different country in order to get a broken car. You are really free but i would say passionate(Its more used word)
Waiting after you fix guys❤
Does this mean i have to follow the repair again after bingeing with the Murciliago???😂😂
they could of said no from pictures, your be able to repair that, you always find a way.
Speak to autoflock in northwales he does all carbon stuff worth a look
What I found funny was when you were looking  at the pyro fuse and was saying, "im glad they dont like to put it in a bunch of different places." he then flashed the porsche symbol referring to the 911 gt3 he fixed up lol 14:06
Great video hope you can save it ❤
Didn’t you have this on show at modified nationals last year?
Send it off to Tavarish
Sounds like a trip to USA
Are you for real....
bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla
nice that you namedrop DDE
eeyyy welcome to the netherlands brother hahaha this is so cool
"My dad's a plumber, he has the ultimate set of tools...we can fix it"! OH!  Jack ~'()'~
Seems assholish from them: if they were able to reject the repair after 1 second in person, they should have easily been able to say the same based on photos. Means they didnt bother to even look at the photos, causing you to make an uninformed decision and related expenses.
So is part 2 out.?
Thats was not german btw
Did we just get a dad name leak!?!?
How do you know how to fix all the cars you do. I tried to change the battery in a calculator and destroyed it. What you do is art
i really hope you fix this,
Dutch people are pretty good
5 mins in...please don't touch it with a barge pole!
Amsterdam is not a country its a city
the country, we head to?! Amsterdam! The one we have started from?! London.. the capital city of car constructors in europe?! Germany! XD
Pair of Clowns ,great information and sounds like a good idea for a trip
Sorry mate but I gotta say Netherlands 🇳🇱 is the country not DAM! Xx keep up the good work mate. 😊
I would have gone for it as well Mat, even to break even at the end of it you can say you’ve owned and repaired one 👍
Amsterdam is such a beautiful country but Birmingham is an equally nice country 😂😂
“The country we’re going to….. Amsterdam” 😂
Can't find part 2
The country your driving to is Amsterdam 🤔🤣🤣
Why didn’t they tell you a 50mm repair is all they can do when you asked about it, before you bought it! 🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️
The country we're flying to.... Amsterdam 😅
Wait, Amsterdam is a country? 🤣
Triangular bracing with correct surface preparation and the correct polymer will fix
Shout out from Canada and the DDE fam 🙌
Mat, hit up v tuned on youtube . He brought a wrecked maclaren and rebuilt the whole car. The carbon fibre cockpit was smashed so he got a parts car. Took him time and gave him some head aches but he did it
Amsterdam is not a country😎
You are completely crazy🔥
They could have so told you that from the pictures, saving you from buying it. About to watch the next episode, have my finger crossed mate 🤞🤞
amsterdam isn't a coutry
The country we flying to:  Amsterdam.  ahm - alright.
These cars are better as wallpaper
The highest car brand am buying lexus
Some t-cut, it'll buff right out😊
Do you think you made a big mistake?     That is how everyone of your videos starts!!!
You should always do your deep homework and research b4 you decide to buy it
Wow, never been to the country of Amsterdam 😂
Amsterdam is a city not a country😅
To the rest of the world; NO, Amsterdam is not a country. In fact, most of the country doesnt even like Amsterdam
anyone thought it was mcskillets?
McLaren have trouble fixing their cars that haven’t been wrecked.
You are tough trying to start that indoors :) . if you bridge the starter solenoid wouldn't  it kick in starter again after engine started. It would be cheaper to buy a used at 120K ?  as parts must be more than 60K
There is two squirrels, and they didn’t like each other 😂😂😂🐿🐿
What wait  i know is about cars,, but  since when is Amsterdam a country? 1:04
Love from Africa Mat🎉...
I’m no expert but if they said £60k for the car in that condition I probably would of just got the next plane home after seeing the state it was in. Good luck 👍
Please, Turkish subtitles ??????
Amsterdam is a city
Imagine being the Batman wannabe who crashed this watching this vid, some craic! 😅
Amsterdam isn't a country.
T CUT can work miracles ..........
You are buying the car ownership, not the physical car.
This guy always thinks he made a big mistake. Then goes and makes big money with the car. I don’t mind, we get the videos to watch, he gets the views.😊
Where there's a will  There's a way...
if the car is non repairable, the parts are worth a bit, so it wont be a huge loss
This guy should rename this show as,   “I don’t want PEEAAACE!! I want PROBLEMS ALWAYS.”
mat once again making me realise how little I actually know about cars 😂🙌🔥
Need to LOW BALL THE HELL OUT OF THIS ONE.
Mat get ya self a NOCO Boost Pro GB150 3000A jump pack, a little pricey, but its an awesome bit of kit, you could jumpstart a jumbo with it lol.  Great videos mate.  Regards   Danny baumback👍
Ok this was a stupid buy bro !! On top 60K !!
Go take a look at how Vtuned swapped out a tub and put together a 720s from scratch
Ur content is so unique and interesting mate ❤
Amsterdam isn't a country
wanna drive it for real!
My new favourite youtube channel 👌🔥
Him doing the ad with the McLaren behind him next to his unit spoils it 😂😂
RUNNNNNNNNNNN
okay, not wishing to seem pedantic, since when was Amsterdam declared a country?   I clearly missed this moment in history 😂
Good
I'm sure you'll do the impossible.
Don't do it! You'll kill yourseeeeeeeeeeeeeeelf!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hi Mat.
Nice
Nyc
I would love to see hanna build a car by her own. This will be a banger for sure
Fair play to you Mat always challenging yourself....very good
i would avoid those things are nightmares
Tony! I heard it
To be fair to the repair specialists and the Dutch company, this purchase was always about generating content.
Rigt
Nice bro go go go
This video is good and car is amazing 😍
Wait, dads name is Tony!?
Hey Matt I'm sure they just said your dad's name TONY
Yeah my country
😂 Batman's face had me
👍
you should ask tavarish about his mate with the special room with all the parts he got for the f1 eco
mats dad name is tony
Learn something : a Dutchman that doesn't rip you off has simply forgotten.
Amsterdam is a city in The Netherlands
Nice
Buy a nether tub watch V tunes garage
Talk to goonzquad some guy in California fixed there svj roof. Supposedly he's the best around maybe you could send them some pics. All nice guys.
wow so beautiful amazing. I am  very like
One of my new favorite builds 😭🤎  First is the M5 one 😫
I commented to you a couple of months back my old man had a factory in Birmingham, carry on round the corner from individual down the hill on the left is his factory. R and S laser cutting and fabrications. If you need anything tell him Dan sent you and he’ll sort you out mate. One of his close mates owns individual. If you need anything just go into the factory, or call the factory and tell my dad to give you my number we can sort anything out for you bro
😮
Matt says ‘wanted to see if it was repairable’ but literally anything is to this guy 😂😂
I was pooing myself when you first stared that 😂 if that was a normal vehicle i would of ok but so much money at stake 😮😂 you’ve got some ⚽️⚽️ mate 👍
Very interesting video. Just go ahead. Always be with you.
You need a competent composite man. Nothing is irreprable.
The country of Amsterdam is great.
Work at mclaren sheffield in repair. Could possibly give you an answer from the guys here about the repair.
20:59 Mat's Dad's name finally revealed 😃
Na nope Not a chance it’s fkd!!!! I’m buying it (respect) 🍻
Just an FYI Amsterdam isn’t a country 🤪
Tony. Only said his name like 10 times
Great content and video. I am curious if there is a true option to repair “outside” of an official McLaren approved center repair? Can you have an independent shop repair the tub and sign a disclaimer or….will they even allow any repairs. I am Really curious how these things go.
9 minutes into the video before you realized a car from Europe is left hand drive, lol
Every time you are convinced you just made a huge mistake, you just put your head down and charge harder until you have something great! Power thru and we are all looking forward to the progress.
The ‘country’ we are flying to ‘Amsterdam’ ??!!??!! Common Mat 😂 Is London also a country?
I can’t believe you were at Bristol airport! I recognise that stand 5 any day! I work there leading teams of aircraft detailing crews!
I really feel left aside hearing and seeing several testimonies from people on profits they make from Bitcoin/Forex Investment... Can someone recommend a good expert that trade on my behalf and generate profit for me..
It is very funny.
it is very funny.
Part it out
this will never become a 2m car ever again, but hopefully it will be drivable
That heat management is 🔥🔥🔥
How can you pay half price for that state knowing that you're going to spend a lot of money to fix it? I mean, £60k for a car that went through a terrible accident and looks like junk when you could pay £120k for a fine one. If you repair it with £15k (if you're lucky), it is going to owe you £75k and you probably haven't counted the manpower, travel etc.. How much can you sell for a repaired car? I mean, if someone can afford £100k he'll rather go to £120 to get one that hasn't been in an accident. There is no way you will this without YouTube's revenue...
There is no way! 😂
WHATS YOURNAME TONY!!
What happened to the green Lambo murcielago?
Just because it had the BATMAN logo was good enough to buy. LOL
There's not gonna be any doubt about Mat's Father's name now 🤣🤣 the amount of times it was said here. honestly, good luck, this looks expensive to fix!
like watch
Cant believe you still bought that, after seeing the damage, and did that seller really say he'd had it running and checked the gearbox?? Surely i misheard that bit?
-A McClaren is by far better looking than a Ferrari or  Lambo. -Classier, built like a professional, caring about each individual part and the whole. -BUT if the frame can’t be fixed you are fked. -BUT I am guessing you know something you are not telling us about this frame and we will all wake up from  this nightmare build and everything will be o.k. — at least the frame for now.    -Then we go back to sleep again and start the next nightmare. -Ma ma… I don’t want to go to bed tonight the man with the funny speech is having nightmares and I am afraid I will get them next …MA MA!!!  “A garage without a Porsche is just a dark hole” —Walter Rohrl – Porsche Development
Hope you will be able to fix this as well. Love your vids. As much as you love cars, I love ariplanes. So I noticed two different type of aircraft in this vid XD. It's like getting into a McLaren and driving out a garage and it the next shot you see a Ferrari. Anyway keep up the good work!!
Mat I have faith in you after other projects you've completed 🙏
Nice guest appearance by Mike, Dave and Tim from Dde and I like the way you don’t hype it or even mention it. I call that a humble flex.
Your Dad's name is Tony 😮😮
everything is repairable one way or another.....gonna be a great project
I’ve watched hours of what you do Hannah is my favourite 😂 so level headed xx
Can I just say thank you to Matt and Freddy we have had a Porsche 911 se targa on our drive for 20 years ! And you have inspired us to get it running and up for sale any tips much appreciated. Thank you for inspiring many and good luck for all you do 😊
Amazing video mate. Go on, you can do it
Break it for parts,  £60,000 plus collecting costs was way too much considering the damage but as your channel is popular should make the money back on videos.
Waaooo the cars are amazing 😍🤩😍
I think it’s bullshit how McLaren goes “oh we need to assess the carbon fibre in person”.  60k later the bloke from McLaren just goes to the car, takes one glance and says it’s not able to be done. Surely they would have known from the photo then??
Im dutch, so Im watching this 😂
can you buy a bugatti one day please?
That Porsche emblem when speaking of power fuse :'D  Come on Mat ! You can do it !
Hahahaha loved the Porsche logo flash while talking about the pyro fuse
hi Mat, if it is a salvage - do you still have to pay import duty and vat?? Looking at a car abroad and trying to figure out if i drive it back when does all the paperwork have to be done??
Really exited to see how you will come around with this build... And I'm sure you'll do the impossible.
1:00 "The country we're flying to? Amsterdam." Uh, Mat?
they absolutely could have said no from the photos. they would have known the location of the tub damage.
Let´s Go ! Wish you the best you gonna fix it !
Mat's Dads name finally revealed!!! @ 11:07 Tony!
This is reposted old content! This habit of YouTube really annoys me by wasting my time! Simple answer. UNSUBSCRIBE! You won’t waste my time again!
QUOTE: “And the country we’re flying to: Amsterdam”. ……. REALLY?😮
Why when they know the size of what they’re allowed to repair did they make you come down instead of over photos?
Matt’s Dad’s name reveal!
15:55 mat's dad name  :)
This series’s is gonna be briliant
Amsterdam is a country now??
Hey, what happened to Liam?  Did you dump him after he Liam'd the Audi?
14:09
Some cars should not be repaired and should not return to the road. For safety.
Good luck, Nice project!
Lifes a gamble if you dont take chances you will never move forward , looking forward to this one 😊
I can say with some degree of confidence that mclaren will be using these videos to train their mechanics 🎉
Need a 3 hour video again like martin video
The rear end to me isn't the big problem.  The busted tub is the big problem.
Try putting it in water.
Next time you are in the Netherlands, take your bike and come visit my indoor miniramp!
I respect your hardwork dear mat<3
Take it to someone who repairs carbon parts for yachts - they will have no problem with this.
The country Amsterdam hahah good one xD
don't know how far are you on this build ......... but good luck and worry up withe the updates !!!!!
they are all drunk on this viv
Hi Mat, the dash actually was in French! Great video as always.
Hi Mat,  Im Luyanda From South Africa Please help my Audi S5 look like beast .🥲
carbon fibre monocoque, EBay £35,000, Ouch!

Where's the murcielago? 🫠
if you fancy a project mate, youre welcome to come over to LE8 im just down the road from you, you can stick the engine in my scirocco haha. I've got the space in my unit, ill PPF your next 4 cars for free.
Good luck Mat!
🇳🇱🇳🇱🇳🇱
😀Hi Mat, this is Lancy from ANCEL. I am reaching out to see whether you are interested in reviewing our OBD2 diagnostics scan tool? Looking forward to your reply.
like need for speed
Life…
The cheeky Porsche logo. Iykyk
So glad a Brit is making these types of videos
FORMULA DRIFT CHAMPION MICHAEL ESSA IS EVERYWHERE.
Started following different car YouTubers as your content is slow and it’s starting to get abit hard to watch now …
Mate Amsterdam is not a coutry 😂
I can't remember hearing your dads name ever. Now three times in one episode!
Amsterdam is not a country, it's city.
The biggest letdown of this channel is its inconsistent uploads times
how was the car crashed? bad driver? 🤔🤔🤔🤔
2 hour flight to the dam? Stfu.
Never heard of a country called Amsterdam🥴😅
Best car ever ❤
I remember VTUNED garage buying an entire McLaren monocoque/chassis and replacing it.
The country we are flying to? Amsterdam. Nice (England is my city)
No worries you’ll get it done😊
Hopefully you get £60k of income from this video
Mmaatttt don’t send us into the week without a fresh video?
they will do it in poland
Looks like a cheap fix... 😆  will buff right out with just a little elbow grease! 😂👌
Amsterdam isn't a country but know what you meant lol.Hope it works out mate I know you love a challenge.
Have you still got the Mclaren hadn’t seen it since you bought it xx love watching you Channel  and I’m 69 lo  xx
👍
So his dads name is tony
Look at V Tune Garage he rebuild one last year.
Can you find a 'cheap' front end damaged car with a good tub?  I've seen high speed accidents where all corners get tagged, but the tub is still untouched.  Those cars might be un-interesting to someone repairing a car because replacing all the bits and bobs costs more than they can get out of the car with a bad accident/totaled/salvage on the VIN and title.
Hi just seen your video, I have a number for a guy who works with carbon fiber and will be able to fix it! Only issue he lives in Devon, but he is very good.
If it's monocoque the repair is almost impossible. Good luck Matt.. :)
You could buy a replacement 720S monocoque and rebuild it around that!?!
That pop up of Batman made me laugh out loud haha
A McLaren in Dutch and still Lewis Hamiltons number shows up haha 12:33
His face when they said no they couldnt repair it.      Part it out
Support from🇳🇱🇳🇱🇳🇱
Nyc
They said instantly no to something they could of saw in a picture after telling you to bring it to them🤷 disgusting
Why buying a wrecked supercar.... She you easily can afford a new car with you YT channel... Oh no wait?? 😂😂😂
Amsterdam isn't a country
I’m sure you’ll find a way forward
The Porsche logo randomly pops up 😂😂
this is really 1mile away from my home this is by de jong in twijzel
MAT CAN YOU BUY AN EV FOR THE NEXT TIME ?
So Matts dad is Tony
Dushane and sully both die at the end
What’s happened to the Ferrari build??
Seen the car at the car show Birmingham loved it
Tony!!! @10:58
W——Kerrs course you can repair 😮 do they not know who you are ! !!
Parts city in the West Midlands have a 2nd hand tub for a 720 a snip at £35k!
New to the channel, but what great content 👏
Why would you want a left hand drive car in uk
If you have cash you can repair any car
2 hours to Amsterdam? 45 mins pal.
Need more content love watching your videos we need more 😂
W video
The country we are flying to : AMSTERDAM
Waiting for another video Matt!! Lol very interesting videos always looking forward to new videos🙌🏽
please do a vid on the ferrari f430
Amsterdam is not a country. The Netherlands is a country.
Amsterdam ain’t a country 😂
Bro the country is actually the netherlands
The country we are flying to: Amsterdam
Finally found out your dads name. Lol.
Worth 25% of original price... wouldn't pay anymore to even contemplate fixing this....
nah... unmount completely and sell all saveable parts. Complete disaster.
Some countries have non repairable writeoff registers for this type of damage  !!
the country we're flying to? amsterdam.  good shit
Lovely car that tho
Track car it is! 😂
This is going to be another epic one....cheers for sorting my Sunday nights for a while Matt.  Pissed myself at the Verstappen pop up 😂😂😂
Looks like an expensive headache to me!! 🤣
DDE coming in clutch
Good luck Mat I think you may need to get Freddie over to give you a bit of a lesson in fixing a McClaren as he is now on his second one big B***s for going for it though
Fly in Tavarish's carbon repair guy💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼
Amsterdam? COUNTRY? He's not only fixing cars, but building new country's to 😂
You're a brave man !!
Some guy in Australia just wrote one off,,Parts maybe??
Hope it didn't fall off the back of an Everyman Transporter 😂😂😂
“the country were flying to? Amsterdam“😅
Are you going to fix the Ferrari
Very wonderful
"The country we're flying to? Amsterdam" thats a CITY!!
Oops
Pretty similar damage to that Lambo Aventador you found at Copart a while back. This project is going to be absolutely mental Mat.
will it be ready for seama?
You can build it. And it's going to be an awesome series.
Your headline isn’t quite right is it ? What Maclaren would have said is, the car is to damaged to be repaired, and they have written it off and that vin number is not to be supplied with parts. Any one in the industry will tell you that car will always be a dog, no matter how clever you think. How could you sell that write off car to someone in good faith.
"The country we're flying to? Amsterdam" I thought only Americans were bad at geography 😅 Great video and great project!
just fix it your self on the carbon repair
"The country we are flying to?.... Amsterdam".  I am so glad your car skills are significantly better than your geography skills... lol kidding.. love the videos.
Still everything to tavarish for his build
"I think ive made a mistake" to the start of every video should be your intro for every new car
FYI. Amsterdam isn’t a country 😂
Tony is an absolute legend… more Tony please 😂🙌🙌
There are some really talented carbon repair people in the bicycle industry lol
Great Vid Matt. I watched this earlier, but then I saw a video of a guy buying a flooded Mclaren. Maybe you could get a monocoque from such a salvage car from the States? 👍
Time to crack out the baking soda and super glue 😂 this is going to be a great build !
Hey Mat, where do you buy your cars from?
bro can you please somehow link up with Matt Watson , i wanna see something lol
Dutch squirrels are extremely uncommon, so I wonder what it was...
Swap that engine into a Model S
Right to repair.  That drives me nuts when a company tells you what you can and can't do with something you paid for.  You own it.  You are not renting it.  It is yours to do with as you like.
Mat, this thing's totaled. 👎
HI Matt  & Hannah ,              Try contacting Reverie LTD , they may be gable to help you with carbon fibre repairs. PS I admire your positive attitude …….and despite facing some some difficult challenges you still keep smiling 😊😊😊😊
Dad's name is Tony :)
this one will be a nightmare,can't wait to see the progres,best of luck mate
The Porsche pop up at the pyro fuse was mad funny
Mat, carbon fiber isn’t safe at all in a car, you see back in the maybe 40’ 50’ 60’s if cars crashed the cars would just give a little hop and all of the energy… needs to go somewhere, what’s the only thing that is not tightly strapped to the car; the human, where does the energry go; the human, and now if you crat a car at a high speed your car folds up, but that is accually safer because the energy of the collision goes into the car.
Amsterdam is not a country. We live in the Netherlands.
The Matclaren😅
I wish you would stop passing me in that bright orange thing on the way to work!, lol..... 🙂 Take care matt!...........
Came here from DDE enjoyed your video. Wish you luck on the rebuild.
Your buddy said your Dad's name
Awesome ❤
Oh this is going to be good hahaha
amsterdam = country
same side damage as DDE
pyro was way easier to find then the one in the porsche lol
Always so cool video, and lear a lot ^^
Love this one. 720. Mental.
😊❤ sell it for parts and get your moneys worth. Yeah you could do that and then fix up another Porsche like you always do in the BMW.
❤😊 met. You did better when you bought the Porsche that was wrecked. Come on bro Yep McLaren looks like needs a lot of work. All right bro peace have a good day and take care.
@vtuned 🎉
Run away...  😳!  However we know Mat will have other plans...
hi some man who nose how to repear things 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
your video not nice 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
play some games
mat
true
he not interesting
bro i dont like mmat
@Vtuned joined The chat
the suspension on this car is so so so expensive
the M720s is know to be one of the UNrilaible super cars
You know Amsterdam isn’t a country right?
Finish the Ferrari first 🤦‍♂️🤣
Tom Cruise should be your inspiration here: He had an idea for an impossible stunt... he asked the stunt guy... stunt guy said its too dangerous... so Cruise got another stunt guy. Go get 'em Mat.
If you look at the company that made the Tub in Yorkshire, ask if they still have the mould and the Autoclave. Its then repairable. I worked for an ex Formula One company making Carbon Fibre parts, so its not a difficult repair for a person who works in the Aircraft Industry.
Just do it yourself. John Britten built industry crushing race bikes out of carbon because he believed he could.
Hey Matt, chances are this won't reach you. But I just wanted to say, what you've achieved in your life, is absolutely amazing and awe inspiring. Thanks for the content you produce and entertain us with!  Just a thought, for people like me who could only ever dream of even having a mk2 TT like you and han started out with and building it up into something special.... Truly is a dream! How about doing something like a "budget build competition" for your subscribers. Something like DMO Deejay has done.... It would bring so much joy to subscribers and viewers alike!
Mat please reply
Bra please tell me why the owner took the car cover off like it's a brand spanking new car 😂 I want whatever he smoking
Why couldn't Individual SC tell him that over email? timewasters
The country we are flying To, Amsterdam 😂
Amesterdam is not a country by the way ...
Time to call the frame Dr and see if he has a friend in the UK
I wish to see the transformation of this channel in 10 years time. I see greatness.
Don’t be a chicken fix it your self it’s only fibre and resin clean it right up strip it back make a peice to fit then install it glass it up done ✅
Not being funny but they took 2 seconds to decide no..could they really not have worked that out from the photos 😂
Best of luck with this one Mat!! I am no expert but my initial thoughts were you may have paid around a third of the value of an equivalent good one so you are off to a very difficult start I think. Can't wait to see the progress though and 🤞🏻
My Mrs says to cut it in half and turn it into a ute! 😂🤣😅
We just found out matt's dads name
DDE DDE DDE x
What great content - I've no idea how you have the energy to keep the consistency going!!
6:00 Killed me 🤣
I saw that the rear shock was damaged. All schocks are linked to each other with oil. Also the lifting tot lift the car is linked with oil from the steering servo.
Drop the running gear into a mini station wagon..old school mini.
Rebuild Nissan GTR please ❤❤❤
Always bring out your Dad, he keeps fun alive!🤣 What ever happens.😊
Easy Composites Ltd .   For help on Carbon fiber
Good luck!
@DailyDrivenExotics
Country….holland 😅
Mat - this is crazy 🤪.  Surely this is only a few grands worth of scrap
That's make sense your friends with Tavarish... I hope u are ready for a headache.... I don't know how mr Tavarish does it but u just pick up a THOT under witch craft of a car
Alright so at the rate Tavarish is going with his P1 I think... It'll be done in about 2.5 years when Matt has already sold this car and gotten into some sort of Lamborghini Aventador.
Damon Fryer nightmare ;)
Tony huh.  Ya dont say!!! 😅
Stick to one project at a time.
No. You havent made a big mistake. You made a financially brilliant move.
Definitely worth fixing this one up.  I wonder with all the great PR Porsche and Lamborghini enjoyed from your last builds and the level of channel subscription, McLaren might help you out on the carbon fibre tub replacement / repair?
Don't listen to them you are more better technician than them. Try repairing by yourself
Traveling all over for parts fme
I think that I would try to find another McLaren with the front end bashed up
and the cheapest you can get one of the right hand drive is over 170000 euro in the Nerderlands or Belgium
Amsterdam is a city
The knob strikes again!
Nobody goin to bring up the girl on the hammock?
constantly refreshing the page to see if a new video has been posted
720 got to be that car that is way to fast for so many people but im not saying don't get one. Cars get smashed even if your good . The 720s looks got a bit ofba dig when it came out I always liked. Plus its suspension is up there with the best on all kind of roads.
Hi Mat,  I'm probably older than your Dad & have been messing about with fast cars & bikes for approx 40yrs. I love your videos & you guys never fail to impress me. But this fix is gonna be on a totally different level mate! I wish you the very best of luck & I look forward to your usual optimism in the face of massive adversity 😃
Imagine what it took to achieve this damage . I bet it was a moment of noooooooo
I'm watching a 720s video in 720p 😎
Yes yes yes finally something very hot
Warld
Amsterdam isn't a country
You should have said Tony’s name!!
Tony 🙌🏼
I'm 55 seconds in.  And even damaged it looks amazing.   I would bought it as well.
*laghs in financial mistake, I love it
Tavarish p1 had a huge crack in the bottom of his tub from the front to the back, his carbon guy is a magical mechanic all of that damage can definitely repaired
Probably just needs some paint and gaffer tape
cant wait for the next episode,
You fall for some right scams, learn to walk away unless you are doing the usual clickbaiting video... We all know the script, also how it will turn out.
Amazing journey. Cant wait to see more! greetings from The Netherlands!
Enjoying these Rebuild Series even though i don't even own a bike
GO GO GO!!! ;)
Never trust dutch salvage car sellers!!  It is always worse than they’re telling you (i’m in the business here in the netherlands). £60k is way too much if a decent one is selling for £110k
looking forward to this series
Erm.... Amsterdam isn't a country......!!!
Mat … it’s not a shame to pass on this one! Too dangerous to drive
what a nice country amsterdam is!
I hope your back is ok, that is some kind of brace you are wearing? For the love of all things holy tell me it isn’t some sort of man bag pouchy chest back contraption 😂
Dude, you may fix it, but does it really worth? That was more than a cat S and you know that! You may make a good profit on parts, atleast 45 to 50 for engine and gearbox.. headlights, dash .. but for sure its not worth the repair
Tavarish has been rubbing off on you 😆 look forward to watching this one ....by the way I want yo see more of that caddy parked outside looks nice !
I fear you might have bought a lemon if you get this one done it will be your best yet .
In real world, this is a scrap/parts car, as even if somehow repaired, no one in their right mind will pay reasonable money for it.  Thanks to the youtube magic, it does make financial sense for people like Mat. Good luck sorting this out - I’m sure it will drive just fine :)
Ooow this one's gonna hurt!!
Did I misunderstand or did that company say they would need to see it in person before saying if they could fix it?  Then just literally say no after a quick glance?
with enough money its always fixable look at @tavarish 😜
Ben ik de enige Nederlander die dit ziet ??
Are you nuts you have seen what dde has gone threw with less damage and tavarish with the p1 and their shells were good
Great video I’m soooo looking forward to this one just fibreglass it, it’ll be fine 😳😂
the family that works together uh sticks together ?
As a regular subscriber I just found that '' Tony '' is Mat's father name . Unless it's a tricky one . Who might know
"The country we are flying to...Amsterdam".... 😶
Tell fatboy to go back to the box of donuts and find a guy like Tavarish did.  That is 1000% fixable!   McLaren are just crybabies and that guy didnt wanna do anything that might make him sweat or lose a few pounds.  He didnt even look at it properly!
Matt I hope your on really friendly terms with your bank manager because this is a whole different level repair job😯
I really appreciated that Porsche Insignia flash when discussing the pyro fuse locations being odd… those are the subtleties that make your videos better.
Who do you think you are Tavarish?? LOL you will be fine Matt as long as you have your Dad!
Imagine watching this 720 video in 720p
Next video will be Mat DIY carbon fibre repairs 😂😂
60k for that 😂
Is this the second video you say your dad's name?
Ugh!
that guy could off said we can barely fix anything over the phone
DONT DO IT!!!!! ow wait its to late for that, greetings from holland
if your dealing with the dutch who said it was running fine who do we trust now
You can talk with “Goonzquad” for carbon demage
"Two squirels that didn't like each other." Brilliant!!
So matts dad is called tony?
In Belgium we have a saying…. if a dutch guy didn’t scam you, they forgot…
So I'm guessing you're going to be importing the bloke who did your friend tavarishs car...
Im sure one way or another its repairable and you're going to repair it but if not you got some $$ in parts thats for sure :)
Yep the Dutch are trustworthy just ask any African …
🦶🦵
Don't want to ruin it for anyone but...  Car Vertical.
Buy a new Tub and transfer everything over
Ahem, Amsterdam isn't a country. ;)
Im wondering for how much he bought the car
Going to be an interesting journey… we are all here to support Matt / Team. I am sure he will find solutions to have it rebuild with or without Mclaren’s help
After this 720s rebuild there will be 1.77 million or more professional mclaren mechanics on earth❤️
A couple of squirts of Tiger seal will sort that carbon tub out.
Time to fly Mike from DDE over to help rebuild it. He definitely has experience fixing the exact rear damage lol.
Strip it and get a carbon guy to fix it.
some one will have one in a back yard  being used a raised garden bed...
I know this is another scale but I’ve used a place called Target Composites who do high end bike repairs. They might at least be able to advise on someone in the industry who does bigger scale, I’m fairly sure the right outfit would be able to do something. Probably limited on size more than anything
DDE is Genius..
Dismount the engine and put it in your audi rs6
soooo now all  just copy TAVARISH LOL..
So clearly they could see from the photos that it was a no, they didn’t actually need to see it
When is the next video Matt ? Also there is a company in Daventry that repair carbon products
Country.. Amsterdam.... COUNTRY?? 🤦‍♂
I love the country of Amsterdam...
Take it back, never buy from a hollander, Always scammed😅
Amsterdam is not a country :D
ADRIAN FLUX  SATHAR CASSIM
Matt you been hanging around @tavarish too long 😂. Congrats on being a fellow McLaren owner!!! I can’t wait to see you bring this car back from the dead 💪🫡
"The country we're flying to: Amsterdam"
I've been totaly addicted to your content. I really love your transparancy and your optimism.  Keep it up.  P.s. I laughed really hard when that Porsche logo blinked. Remembering the GTR rebuild 😅
I love your videos because I love CARS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Why couldn't the techs tell you  that the repair area was too large from a photo?! Best of luck mate!
Amsterdam isn't a country my friend.
lol buys a car in the netherlands, probably swapped german with dutch and the language turns out to be in french.  We have a Singer who does the same. his name is Frans Duits translate to french german and he sings in dutch. ;-)
Maybe the question on this wreck is not can I repair it but should I repair it?
Sooo looking forward to this build 😊
lesters finest at it again in the face of adversity and never taking no for an answer, keep up the good work mat,you got some grapes there to take this on, got every faith in you to prove the naysayers wrong
Vote pyrofuse for the merch 🔥
1:04 Amsterdam isn’t a country 😂
Ask EVIL GT Lee has the same car
Fix the death trap then auction it off
tony is a great name dad <3
i know tavarish is already ordering custom rods 4u, to match the replacement ones his blown 675 motor is getting after it blew up in hard up's joyride he was giving in his pride and joy, and probably the catalyst for this p1 project.. but you gotta luv his confidence he's gained from that 1st gallardo he started with.. as every creator cringed when they 1st saw it in person.. but strangely i don't doubt he'll pull it off, just hope he does it under budget.. anyways, godspeed on your new journey, mat
“Trusting the Dutch”: poor misguided Mat😢 the search for a honest dutch cardealer is still going on.
quite easier pyro fuse vs the 911 hiding it behind the whole front dash and 2 days of labor
respect for watching dde 720 fails for lessons you don't have to learn yourself.. fyi - this hidden analog key is also common in some normal cars, it took me 30min to find 1 while locked outta a jeep i had just borrowed form a friend, and the fob battery died in home depot lot with a full trailer of plywood
"The country we're flying to, Amsterdam." - Mat 2023
i know mat is usually very smart about his cars b4 purchase, but i hope he showed freddy and the carbon dr some pics b4 pulling the trigger.. cuz certain tub damage will weaken the all carbon structure and not get back to original strength even repaired by the best
You just know there's a Plan A, B and C. This guys too smart to take a chance like that...Freddie will have a spare tub knocking about or there's another wrecked one will do as a doner. It's a biggie for sure and raises it yet another level..go Team Mat🤘
ITS A SKWIRULLLL 🎉
I didn't knew Amsterdam was a country. Learning new stuff every day.
important
At least we now know your dads name is Tony!!!
Lezzz Go Champ!
GOOD
Love the manufacturer shoutout at 14:09 😄
Bet Matt has this thing running a year before TAVARISH has his done
10:56 yall messed up and told dad's name then again right after it!
I wonder if this will be the Frame Doctor's first trip to the UK.
Mat's dad's name is Tony...😮
You are fearlessly fair play to you matt
You and Tavarish are total degens I love to see you guys at it :)
I’d risk repairing this over some yellow P1 I seen sitting on a toilet on YT lol
I assume Mat wears carbon fibre underpants. He would need them to carry his two BIG objects contained therein.
waiting for the fallow up video to see what happens.
That thing is mint! Was it as clean as advertised? You stole that one buddy!  Lol! But for real Mat I'm confident you can fix it! It's a great thing Tavarish is a good friend of yours!  Good luck
60k isn't a deal on that car it's a liability but if anyone can turn this lemon into lemonade it's Matt Armstrong and his dad. Good Luck ❤
I hope the engine didn't inhale debris
fix it matt fix it!!
I don't think the juice will be worth the squeeze.
Robots are making mistakes ... we r only humans .. Don’t risk again.. Your videos are better than Hollywood ones ! Enjoying every single one Epic !
@tavarish
Mat if you manage to fix this you need to keep it as one of your own 🔥🔥🔥
Sorry mate. Complete write off. Sell for parts and try to recoup your money. 🤷‍♂️
It'll buff out
This is insane, I'm defo following this rebuild.
M5 auction set you up for big time Mat, we all reap the rewards!
Ok but did NO ONE NOTICE!?! TONY IS HIS DADS NAME!!!
Guess it's time to call V tuned.
wouldnt it have been cheaper to fly out the technician to holland?
Hollandiaaaaa
Another big one yet❤. Ofcos you can do it
1st class Plane tickets for the carbon repair doctor
Need to get tavarish's man there
Now we’re just waiting for mat to own a rolls and a buggati 😅
I thought the Dutch were honest "engine and GEARBOX tested and running all good" yet your gear box started leaking straightaway world's just full of liars
There is a carbon fibre manufacturer near me in Swindon, Wiltshire not sure if they’d be able to help but worth a shot as I know the build parts for mclaren and f1 cars. The company is called Retrac Group
the cameraman keeps giving spoilers about mats dads name 😂
Mechanic Jack’s team can fix that😃
Ah this shall be my new YouTube addiction 😁👌🏻👍🏼
A 720s for 125k is crazy, in the US they're 230-330k
Always trust the process
The country of amsterdam never heard of it
so they said it would start and that the engine ran went through all the gears etc was tested but never mentioned a leak hmmm trust the Dutch lol i think its 2023 you shouldn't trust anybody's word regardless of origin but i will say for some of the projects you get yourself into etc you sure do have strong faith and patience so i give props to that
Did you get a receipt for a refund
McLaren say no, Mat says yes 🙌
Am I the only one who noticed… his dads name is Tony
We about to witness another amazing history from MA going down , McLaren will have no option than to believe in MA
A panel gap you can get hand in lol
Ngl most of these "supercar specialty" shops rub me the wrong way because they always have some sort of explanation as to why they cant repair a crashed vehicle if there any real "specialty" work required.
Ship the tub to @Tavarish to have his guy fix the tub?
"Where's the oil coming from?"  "Engine"  😂
The country we're flying to - Amsterdam.   🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
Does your dad answer all calls from you with, "What did you buy now? And where is it?"
What caused all this damage? Did the owner hit a sei doing 180 MPH?
if the carbon body monocoque is toast then its the new car, you can just pull the engine maybe put it in something else :D or am I wrong?
Showing love from South Africa
Very excited about this 720s build this will be elite 🔥🔥
Was interesting to see the car at gravity show before any work started
I would definitely be watching DDE and talking to Mike Essa and getting a  understanding of how these are put together. Not saying your not capable of the impossible as you have shown your resilience to the masses I have nothing but the upmost respect to what you have achieved 🫡
Drivetrain must be worth best part of what you paid. Part it out or send to copart. Don't recall seeing what it was categorised as and you said that wasn't something that interested you, but it should have, If it is Cat A or B, it cannot be repaired full stop.
Dude you owe your dad so much. And your mum from the sounds of it this time.
The merci is the absolute best car you own- and would rather that in the color you have over the white more rare car.   I actually think the merci is the best Lamborghini ever if not the best car ever
Love it ! You can do it mate 👊
i dont understand why Mat bought this car just becuase of only 50% off compare to the cheapest working used car  , From my experience, if ther any faulty or heavy damaged product listed in eBay , its usually 80~90% off in the market. 50% off is not worthy.
I know you do this as much for yourself as the channel, but could you not have sent detailed videos and photographs to the official approved repairers first ? or would that have spoilt an interesting video and the fun of risk taking ? .... Blimey Mat you're a brave bugger i'll say that, where do you go from here ? find a repairable tub ? 😮 just a thought ......
That geezer who was selling it, said he'd had it running! Sue him!!
The Dutch trustworthy? 😂😂😂
Cool  man
DDE 🤣🤣🤣
I would like to say I think you have made an mistake due to watching dde with there mclaren but I love watching you the video so all the best mat
Only a 1 hour flight, but an hour time difference 😂
Finish 1 project first. Still waiting for ferRari vids
So Mat's dad is named Tony!!!!
I love how its already loaded to go at 7:30 but it then cuts to a scene where its back off the truck and you're saying 'now we've goto make the descision on whether we're buying this' lol
TONY!!!!! HIS NAME IS TONY !!!
My fav McLaren ❤❤ Novitec body kit ?? 😳
I love the fact that you’ve potentially lost a bomb on this car and yet you’re still smiling.  Hope you have more positive news after a big internet search Mat.  👍
How much would a new carbon tub from Mclaren cost?
Mate plz do the rest of the Ferrari
Amsterdam is not a country but a city. :-)
👍
How to become a member of this Great Channel?
Hi  Love the Mclaren 720s I think this will be a great build really excited to see the finish product. I get to see loads of Mclarens so fingers crossed
Seems like an easy job. Nothing more than the usual McLaren build quality issues and panel-gaps 😂
Amsterdam is a country now i guess
Awesome vid mate, that 720s will need some serious work done. I am breaking a McLaren 720s myself for parts, feel free to reach out to me, I can sort you with a Monocoque too :)
Amsterdam is a lovely country 😂
11:55 "The dashboard's in German". Display is in French.. Aiyaah
amsterdam is my favorite country, hands down
You can do it Matt I believe in you all mate you can find a way to have that 720 back on the road!!!
The COUNTRY we're flying to: Amsterdam. Hmmmmm..... Something's not right here. Brb, getting a visa to travel into Manchester
Amazing how much money can be made on these youtube vids to allow you to buy a worthless car for 60k.  Congrats!
So i guess its no longer Matts Dad its just Tony. 😂 thanks guys
Just because McLaren won't repair it and a McLaren authorised repair shop won't repair it, doesn't mean its not repairable.  I'm guessing that no one can stop you from repairing it.
Try kream development
Have fun  dde is doing the same thing right now and its 💰💰
The fact it's clearly written " francais " on the dash when he's choosing the language and he still said German 😂😂😂😂
“Flying to another country; Amsterdam”🤣🤣🤣
Was anyone else actually sitting with their fingers crossed when he started it?
My Dream car finally
Genuinely impressive how bad that is and how optimistic you are. Fair play to you sir!😊
You let your dad take your car out for a drive and it comes back on a flat deck. Tony, what did you do?!?! 🥴
he literally called mike essa ❤
started the video with broken car then forwarded it 18 minutes and its still on that carrying truck ,,saved me the horror ,,sorry 😀
ahaa so his dad's name is Tony 15:54
You should call the frame doctor over from the USA to get it fixed 🤞
We've gone from Tony having no name to a video where his name is massive 😂
the porsche symbol about the pyro fuse hahahahahahah
Mat i can't wait to see the final 🔥
This will be a epic build Mat c'mon 👍🏾
Now we all know your dads name 😮
🙂 but it always seems to be the LAST thing you should do 🙂
The dashboard was in French, not in German 😂
As long as the Carbon of the Mono isnt damaged and the engine is good. Why not.
You actually cant fix the carbon. You can slap more on it, and call it good....but its like slapping a band aid on it. It wont actually be fixed....but youll feel better about it......I guess.
Finally, we know Matt's dad is called Tony!!!
Built it anyway
Welcome to the club of guys buying Sportscars from the Netherlands to fix it, an find out why they are so cheap, i repaired once some MP4 C12 and the nice guy said no problem it runs and works, I know what you will go throu, and we found some Cracks going throu the monocoque even with less damage
nice i come from the Netherlands
McLaren sent the chassis of a F1GTR Longtail they were restoring to GTR Composites in Arundel for a repair. (Ref: Octane magazine No: 187 Jan 2019). Funny what relevant stuff pops up when you are reading a 4 year old magazine on an aeroplane.
This is going to be epic I thought the 911 GT3 was a big build this is mega 🙌🙌🙌
I think it’s possible if anything use tavarish’s carbon repair guys or see if V Tuned still has his McLaren tub and you can just cut that section out.
Pops name has been revealed.....
Scared and excited at the same time..!🤘🏻
2 hour flight? We did you go via? Italy? lol takes about 50 mins
review are awful all say it is a scam
Tony! Dads name is Tony! 😂👍🏼
Welkom in Amsterdam en daar wonen veel oplichters Enjoy Pro
Praying that this awesome piece of British engineering/ technology / design is fixable, its so easy these days to label a car as scrap....and thank goodness there are guys like Matt & team taking up the challenge; all the best of British luck getting this beauty back on the road.
So Mclaren said no to the repair, and you expected the authorised mclaren workshop to say yes? You dont bite the hand that feeds you...
Good luck with this one Matt, looks like it’s going to be a huge challenge! I’m sure you’l do it👍🏻
Seen it on msbs Chanel haha
Lovely car...best of luck with it ..FYI Amsterdam is a city in Holland/Netherlands
This guy's dedication is honestly something else
Worse case senario you have to get a new monocoque, Vtuned did it!
I believe in ya!
Amsterdam is not a country mate.
Sounds like you need a new or repairable tub bud..
MA this seems 2 be so so bad...
Love the Porsche logo flash at 9:10..lol
Nah
There’s a company near in Fontwell near the race track, just outside Chichester called GTR, I worked with them for a few years, and they have a guy there, who used to fix the McLaren F1 road cars for McLaren.. Not been there since covid though so he might have moved on.
This is gonna cost fortune 😅
Get a new tub ?
Dont you ever sing, oops i did it again in the workshop? 😂
took the risk!
ill fix it for a free tshirt
You should talk to Vtuned garage as he did a 720 rebuild & he had to replace the tub in his 720 & he knows the car very, good luck mate & look forward to seeing you rebuild this one
En daarom laat je je zoon niet in een auto rijden met 800pk en geen abs enzofoort
The man didn't even finish well RS6 as he switched to McLaren and that's worse than the ferrari or the lambo
yeah, CarVertical is sh!t
i'm from Africa Namibia, i stand so far from the job you do moreover all this cars that you repair, your profession, hard work and determination. Mat... you move many from far places that you can't even imagine. Proud of every spot and the journey you have embarked on since the start. you doing amazing Champ...i drive a Mazda, one day, i will drive that M5 that you worked on 😅😅😅
Hope you come right. It’s just a hurdle✌🏽
Wild!
BROS PULLING A TAVARISH
What absolute shysters. They could have told you that on the phone. Unimpressed
Mattclaren... Get it... I'll see myself out.
Find the company that made the carbon fibre for the Titan sub, I'm sure they'd repair it! 🙃
Love Amsterdam the country that speaks German 😂
tavarish will help out, also nice to see team up with DDE
I'm thinking that you probably paid double what you should have paid for that Mat.
Did I miss your papas name reveal or is it just a nickname?
DDE fam
10:55 did I hear Mat's dad name called "Tonny" at this point? 😮
Like the fact he snuck the porsche in about their pyrofuse
Matt you have some massive kahuna's on you to take on some of these repairs, But I have a feeling the moment he said. No. Your kahuna's were no longer massive 😂
The porsche flash at 14:08 about the pyro fuse, lol! Looking forward to this progressing already
You HAVE finally lost the plot -  Amsterdam isn't a country Mat 🤣 Love MacLaren! Can't wait for this rebuild - what a massive challenge. That poor 720 looks pretty bad! Good luck guys!!!
mat at it again 👑 🔥
Dude just casually revealed matts dads name...
lol, the famous country of Amsterdam, where they speak some German that really looks like French
Good thing they let Mat drive to the repair-service. If only it had been possible to send pictures via internet for a preliminary recommendation... Oh wait, there is. 🤷🏿‍♂
"The country we're flying to - Amsterdam"...  Um, that's not a country.
"The dashboard is in German" *shows French*
If I leaks oil…it has oil
so TONY!
Better paying double for a used one
IF DDE CAN DO IT SO CAN U
you could probably find a water damaged tub somewhere. swap the parts across.
Squirel :D
Only just realised your dads called Tony 😂
Hard work beats talent 💪💪
Great effort and chemistry, always having fun watching the videos. In particular that you build cars from all over Europe. My advise, take it apart and look at the pieces individually. There is always a solution and nothing is lost forever.
So excited to see the progress
Amsterdam isn't a country dude... 😂
So Mat went to the country called Amsterdam :)
New tub..! Or bring the guy over from the states.
Amsterdam is not a country!
You are a brave man taking that on. I suspect your expected repair budget might just be blown already but looking forward to you returning it to the road.
we all know Mat will get this thing fixed, no matter how bad it looks rn. God bless you Mat!
When you know you  out of your depth
Amsterdam is now a country hmm 🤔  I thought Amsterdam was in Holland 🤔 Ha Ha Luv it  Keep going guys love the content 👍👍👍❤️
How could the repair specialist not tell you it wasn’t possible before you bought it 😡
UK to Amsterdam 2 hour flight. Where in UK you live?? o.O
When you press the brakes, it will fast crank. You were probably holding the brakes
Fastest car for 35miles, then you need a rebuild
So inspiring do you sell this cars ?
Sorry if I am trying to teach you to suck eggs,  if you do get the tub fixed, after changing the gearbox oil cooler check for water in the gearbox oil. That oil cooler is a sandwich type with alternating plates holding water and oil.
1.3m views in 1 day, you're exploding; congrats, Mat well deserved!
Mat😮
If McLaren don’t want you to fix it then don’t tell them. Find a carbon specialist & do it the hard way, just like normal. 😎👍
Tony! 🎉
Sorry but what flight did u take for it to take 2hours takes 40 mins from stansted
don't forget that the that 720 has a proprietary suspension system that only a maclaren dealership/registered mac can reset due to the special tools required....just ask the guys at DDE who have the same damage on their 720 gtr.....
I am here for Mat’s Dad’s name TONYYYYYYYYYY
Think we might all know mats dads name now 😂. Epic car, can’t wait to watch the rest of it and fingers crossed you can get the CF repaired 🤞🏽 all the best.
Saw that Porsche logo flash. 🤣🤣🤣
The country we are flying to………Amsterdam lol
feels lame they couldn’t tell that damage from a picture before buying?  nothing they saw was more than what you would see by snapping a quick photo! best of luck bruv! 🙏
@vTuned did a 720s, 2 years ago and had to replace the tub after accesing it... i'm sure he'll be happy to help out
Talk to tavarish about who did the tub for the P1 or hit goonzquad up and talk to them about who they used for the Lamborghini carbon fiber repair out in cali and see if you can fly one of them out to fix it.
It’s an easy fix. Just jack the radiator cap up an change the cab
If the body can't be fixed is it possible for u to do n engine swap n put the engine of that McLaren on another car
Mat: "😯where the oil come from" Dad: " THE ENGINE 😄😁😆👹👹👹👹"
Reach out to @Vtuned garage. I’m sure he can be able to advise as he has built a McLaren on his channel.
Nice video. Looks like you will be buying a tub for that one.
Tony is his name!  Fly the dude who worked on Taravish P1 over.
1.3 million views in 24hrs mat. Nailed it mate
Your dad is the best 😂 11:32
Vtuned fix one worse then that
ship it to florida
This is how Legends Are Born 💪
So! His name is Tony!
This time fr Good luck
That split  second flash to Batman  straight killed me...🤣
Have you thought about 3d printing any parts?
Need to borrow Tavarish's carbon fiber guy... He'd have it straightened out in a weekend..
Bummer, mat!   I see you picked this car up in twijzel. (Like 10km from my house) I would definitely come and fangirl and ask for a signature on my car. 😂  Good luck with the build!
Its in Birmingham no way
Time to part it out
MAT! What were you thinking?!! 🤔
I would have walked away. This is going to be one expensive rebuild but love your optimistic approach
NO MUCH WORK CHANGING TUBS
So, you know what a gear box smells like mate?
Does it start?😂😂😂😂
Your dad’s name is Tony?
Time to fly Tavarish's carbon guy to the UK!
wouldn't buy a Mclaren w/ a damaged tub
Will the engine fit in a Mk2 Audi TT shell? 😂 Not quite sure about your options here, maybe bit off a little more than can be chewed. We shall see!
I've  only seen this and tavarish' McLaren. So they're garbage collectors?
£120,000 for a used 720!  Cheapest used 720 in Australia is the equivalent of £220,000!!
Welcome to your 1 million £, 3 year project.
Yes, that body can be fixed, I've been working with Fibreglass and different composites for over 45 years now, I'm a master mold maker in the composite industry and very well known by the major automotive, boat, hot tubs spas, truck or lorry LOL etc, you need to find the right person to REALLY look at the body up in a lift for a while before anybody can say NO, like those guys  came out and said right of way nah, maybe they are not good enough to take a challenge of that nature, so goos luck, I know that you are going to rebuild that car and it will look great like all the car you"ve done so far, I really enjoy your channel, by the way mate I did live in the UK for almost 2 years in West Sussex, a neighbourhood called Maiden Bower, cheers form Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, bye for now Giuliano.
This will be the best one yet. If at all even possible. Pressure is on big time.
Mannnn i love these rebuildssss
I love your stuff bud. But this something I would never have touched 😂😂👊🏻 worst one yet
Good luck Mat!!!.
Ooh this is gonna be epic!
Why did you buy such a destroyed car.....lol, Can't wait to see next episode...You guys are awesome
I can't wait to see you fix this.
Can be repaired mclaren wont repair a job that big, the tub is nearly the same as a an Alfa 4C tub 😉
The country we are going to, Amsterdam ".... welll thanks Mat... Greetings from the Netherlands🇳🇱 (pretty close to Amsterdam 😉)😂
I come from the Nederlands 😂❤
Carbon repairs have come along way but the tubs a big job. Here we go again, he’s like a challenge!
Hell yea. DDE saves the day haha
I believe in team Mat
Ha yes, the country of Amsterdam, lol
Dealers like that annoy the F*** out of me, they immedietly said no as soon as they saw it, which means they could have easily seen from the pictures that it wasn't repairable. just wasting your time.
Ahhhhh his name is Tony
So... Amsterdam now is a country! 🤦‍♂
This is going to be a fun journey.  Can't wait for the ride.   Na Na Na Na.............
“The country I’m flying to: Amsterdam”…. 😂.
Great build, exciting to see this one evolve. Wish the camera man would stop narrating so much though, I think I’ve heard his voice more than yours.
This makes great viewing a massive challenge and I’m sure we all know matts the man  🤞👌🙏
Scrap it - mental
Crazy
Thats looks like its going to be a very expensive fix 🤯
BF says all carbon can be repaired, those mclaren approved chaps have their hands tied up by the woking dictators,  have a chat to the lads at dark matter composites, they specialise in carbon repair work for F1 and aerospace industry and training. Im sure they are able to help. best of luck
Mat, you looking for parts?  I've seen some of these at the auctions in Japan. Some with the front end messed could take 2 and make 1.
It's a trap!
720s s one of my favourite cars, man. If you somehow manage to pull this off, then hats off to you man
It's and interesting repair...but it can be done...just need to assess parts etc. I think paying for an airplane ticket would have been cheaper than buying it for the specialist to see it in person...just saying
Fix it fix it fix it fix it fix it fix it!!!!!!
Anything can be repaired just because they said no there are plenty of professional carbon fibre repair shops out there 👍🏻
No good 😂😂😂
Matt: Can you fix it? Specialist: immediately no. Matt: Hahahahahahahahaha.  😂😂😂
Matt I know your dads name. Hehe 😅
Mate bit of duct tape will fix that, mclaren don’t know what they’re talking about
Is mats dad named Tony 😂
Ohh the amazing country of Amsterdam
Invite @Vtuned! He brought one back to life
Bro is definitely the tj hunt of the auK
Nut in it then send it back😂
The dad’s name is Tony!!!
You win some, you lose some. Engine would dope for another project.
Sell the engine to Tavarish
Amsterdam’s not a country mate 😂
Will this end up being a donor for one of Tavarish's?
VTune put a whole tub in his 720
Can you buy a new tub for it?  If not can you put the engine in something else?   No way should you repair that it’s just not safe to do so once you’ve broken the homogenous structure.
Stop taking the piss and buying cars and finish the lambo... that's an order.
Anyone else catch his Mat’s dad’s name? 😁
Christ, he could have told you that it's not repairable from photographs or a live video, what a wanker! 🤷🏼‍♂️
You got this !!!! There are guys that can fix that for $5000. Gut the car, rebuilt it like you always do !!!!! Start ordering parts.
Amsterdam isn't a country lol
Dude you should check out DDE they recently rebuilt their 720 gtr
Just when you think what will he do next Mat goes to the next level 👏👏
If Tavarish can rebuild a P1 submarine  you can do this one Mr A. 👊🏻
Camera man’s chat is bang average. Pretty unnecessary and annoying addition to the videos.
His dad named Tony his wife said it
if the engine is good you can recoup almost half your money right from that they are going used anywhere from 20k-40k
Get the Doctor a plane ticket from Florida!
Funny how the ‘Specialist ‘ just looked it for 5 seconds from a distance and said no.. typical Mechanik .. ‘replace the whole thing you can’t just fix it’😂 Mat WILL find a solution as always does!! Real inspiration!! Keep it coming!!!
Amsterdam is a city !
8:21 11:08 13:30 Bookmark for the future - Matt’s Dad name mentioned
At least we know your dad's name now 😂. Fly the carbon guy who fixed Tavarish's over to the UK?
Where is the Ferrari ?
60k in the bin 😬
Looking forward to your outside the box thinking 🤔 lol
The country is Amsterdam? 😝
have you considered gorilla tape?
The country were flying to ,” Amsterdam”
nice country amsterdam mate
we all love a Pyro fuse, brilliant Mat 😁
The country we’re flying to…. AMSTERDAM 😂
Try another garage
I’m actually gob smacked jeeez I love your confidence and respect that you constantly want to learn more in repairs fair play. This is crazy and gonna be a epic series.
TONY
The night shift at Koenigsegg... ?
Can't wait to see this series!
Fly TAVARISH carbón guy to the uk to do the repairs duh !!!!😮
I’m thinking you’ve brought a track car? It won’t be road legal again but someone will be able to repair that carbon and you can use it on the track?? Try and making the fastest one in existence!!
1:07 Yes, the beautiful COUNTRY of Amsterdam…
Did we just find out Mat’s Dad’s name?!
You gave it away half way into the video that you’d bought it ;)
Bro you are in D
McLaren carbon submarine?😊
Sell the parts.
Hey Matt, Drop me an email. I build F1 chasis at moment for a team in Europe and have built mclaren chassis. Can give you some detail if you want it.
Matt think you can bi the tub for the  car but i bet they not  cheep m8
Did no one realised that Mat’s dad’s name is Tony or I’m the only one?
As 720s owner that one is buckled 😂 but if you can rebuild this incredible!
Goodnight!!! 🤦‍♂️ if anyone could I feel as if you could!!! Good luck
Well done, can't wait for the project to start and all that. Now give us an update video for the Ferrari!
Looks like your flying Tav's carbon man over!
I feel sick!
720 engine in the Ferrari 😂
Hell No DO NOT BUY THAT CAR ITS GONNA COST MORE TO FIX THEN ITS WORTH!!!!!!
This is the time you would need to reach out to Bicycle carbon mechanics or specialists. A lot of very good carbon bikes are made by the Dutch as well. Or consult carbon bicycle manufacturers in the UK
Bricking it for you, but so excited to see the progress. Good luck Mat. 😊
Tony
"The country we're flying to? Amsterdam" I thought only Americans were that bad with geography and calling cities countries 😂
I thought in Birmingham you can repair any car no matter the problems....
This is easy. You will fix it for £5000 and hava a blast. Good luck. Waiting for the next episode...
Hopefully a subscriber will reach out and get the body repaired
I thought Freddie was crazy... Matt is next level crazy 😂... If he pulls this one out of the bag, he cements himself as the best automotive YouTuber on the planet and no mistake 👌
Good luck with the project. One of my friends had a mclaren that got damaged. The repair bill was over 100k so mclaren wrote it off sadly
Mat’s Dad name has been finally revealed
Dutchie entered the chag
I would never trust max the prat
More worried about him saying amsterdams a country
I suspect this car belonged to DJ Dark Raver. He uses the Batman logo. At least, this could be a good option.
Love the chemistry between you all and the positivity even when facing gigantic challenges
Other title. I bougth half a McLaren
You definitely have large testicals for this mate 😂
Im sure you’ll get it fixed !! Theres got to be 60k in parts there
Engine and transmission work.....yeeeee courseeeee they do 😂
We need information about Ferrari and lamborghini  cars
Couple tickets for the frame Dr. No biggy
You will fix it, i beleive that 100%.
The camera guy gave up your dad's name.. now we know 😅😅
There's a tub on ebay 35.000
Get Freddy’s man over to work his magic on the tub
1:03 "the country we're flying to... amsterdam" i hope that's a mistake that never happen again mr. mat
I think I know Mats dads name now😅😂😂😂😂😂 @matarmstrong
Mat, you've done it again. This is a total No No. I would say, it's impossible to fix,.But I look forward to seeing you try.
Jack Nichelson took his dad’s laugh in the originl Batman. Amazing. Did his dad build a time machine?!
Mat is perhaps one of very few popular young YouTubers that genuinely works for his coin. Good lesson in life for everyone out there who thinks that making it is easy.
You are mad!! Will look forward to this one. Should see the winter out 😆👍🏻
You said the country you we're flying to was Amsterdam, lol.
Mat - This is going to be an epic ride........ as you say HWBT,,, this will be hard but go for it man
What's mad is we all know you and your dad are gonna sort it. 😂
Feel sorry for him sometimes  But he always comes up smelling of roses
Finally ! Mat’s dad’s name is Tony🤫
Love your projects am all the way in south Africa cape town,if I had finance I would suscribe, but love what you do ❤
Nice that McLarens come with a cooking pot 4:27
Ah, a bit of J-B Weld, be right as rain.
You don’t make mistakes. The ex of this awesome machine did. Next time a ford focus huh?
Did I just hear someone use his dads name 🤔
Smiling, laughing and remaining positive,  such an inspiration! All the best with the rebuild bud!
This channel is exploding 🎉
Yes!!!! This is going to be an awesome series!
Can not believe that dad's name was dropped during this video Matt. It was one of life's mysteries. Get editing it quick 😂
Matt your father's name is todi
Mate I'm so looking forward to this series, its gonna be fascinating and I KNOW you'll sort something out. I do wonder however, with it being mclaren, are the panels built bespoke car to car or is it all "off the shelf"
Let’s go gang you gottah race @tavarish
DDE are wicked
Trip to the dam eh? 😶‍🌫️ You totally ruined the suspense mate, the car was clearly already on the flatbed while you were doing the carvertical add…. Also amsterdam isn’t a country 😆 still…. Car’s sick mate 👌🏻
6:49 😂😂😂
I hope Youtube are paying good ad money on this video.
I really hope this actually becomes a project, some 720s content would be really nice
Amsterdam, my favourite country ❤
im wondering who is paying for all these crazy projects
Vtuned did replace the carbon tub for his 720S and he got it for $10,000USD if i am not mistaken. If that is the case your not far off from your price and i do not doubt you can do it
Matt hoping you'll fix up a Nissan GTR someday! Would love to learn a lot from you about it 😅
Yep, so Mat is now going to become a full on carbon repair specialist. Can't wait for this Arc lmfao
sell it to Tavarish
So it's 'Tony'.......
Anyone else catch how many times Tony's name was in the vid?
prove me wrong, but i think you might have bitten off more than you can chew here.
You got this!
Ask tavarish for help
TONY!!!!
£60k soo cheap are you for real mat?? Come on let's hope the YT revenue pays for it cos those Maglaren parts prices will make your pips squeak😅😅😅
"The country we're flying to: Amsterdam"
I would sit on it and wait for a replacement tub to become available all the best with it pal 👍🏻
I clicked on all the ads mate. Good luck!
Look for another crashed one hit in the front. You could make one good one out of both! Easier said then done I’m sure.
Didn’t know Amsterdam was a country?
If you can get a new shell
Gonna need a bigger hammer bud 👍👍
60 bag paperweight then 😂
Nice car from twijzel in frisian, the  netherlands 🎉 nearby my house !
Target composites might be worth a call.
Going to have to change the tub which is going to take a while but on the positive side a few more videos to watch. Pretty sure vtuned changed a 720tub on his channel 🤙🤙
VTuned Swapped  Out His Tub On His McLaren... He Sais It Was Simple ...
The price you paid is worth it in parts
Vtuned done a 720 tub swap 👍
Manufacturers like to put it in loads of different places... with the subtle Porsche badge flash. I'm dying
7:34 why does it look like yall standing in front of a green-screen wtf
you are amazing !
Think your better sending that to tavarish 😂
Time to get the carbon fibre out
Matt, fly out the Dr and let him fix it.
Amsterdam isn't a country.
1:04 "the country we're flying to... amsterdam!"   :(
Max Verstappen image 😂😂😂😂😂
Pull the motor and make a custom skeleton car. You can sell all the good parts to recoup some funds.
Brilliant video
Make a kit car out of it or parts car
any questions about it ho to fix it 👉👉 VTUNED
So go buy another crashed one and build one out of two.
Great stuff! The only thing that I don't quite get is, that the guys at the tub repair said, they can't decide from the picture, they need to see it live. Than you buy the car, bring it to them, and they look for a nanosecond on the damage and say definitely no. What the fck did they immediately see live with was not on the picture???? I'm astonished how calm you reacted to this, I would have sued them.
Dutch people trustworthy!  Do me a favour
whats with the porsche badge flashing up for a second?
Fly tavarish repair guy over here to fix it
You will make out what you want to do.. but i dont rlly understand such rebuilds. Try get ahold of older Group B cars Etc.. why focus on such "Trash" in my mind..
Break it!  Sell the parts- Take the hit on the chin
Hannah just gave it away!! Mat's dad's name is Tony!
This channel is just turning into super cars now, nobody will own.
Well it’s said that God loves a tryer and this is a project and a half! OMG………just where would you start??? With your enthusiasm and positivity Matt I’m sure that this could be turned around by my o my just how will you get McLaren onboard to sell you the parts? This will make the GT3 RS look like a stroll in the park. Good luck and can’t wait to see the next video…………peace out 🙏🙏
Even the squirrel’s didn’t think this one was ever getting repaired! 😂 ….But their plan had 1 fatal flaw, that They NEVER saw coming! …Mat Armstrong! 😁  But Blimey lad, This one is a BIGGY! 😱
HI , Amsterdam is a city not a country
Hope you can sort this good luck m8 🫶
MTt, Hannah just gave your dad a name check ! It's out in the open now!😂
Who's tony
Nothing has stopped mat before, it ain't going to stop him now 😊
I guess its £60k worth of McLaren spares or ship over to Tavarish!
The country, Amsterdam! haha love it.
Good luck with this one dude 😄
60 grand mistake😱
Aston martin next!!
I think it’s hard to see the full damage to the carbon fibre. You’d have to strip everything back to see full extent of repairs. Speak to more carbon fibre experts on suitable repair methodologies and try to convince McLaren.
Every car you buy is a mistake that is why we are here to witness and watch you fix those mistakes. All the best on this one.
How much weed did you smoke before you bought this monstrosity.... I'm really looking forward to the series! You're absolutely insane dude!
Am I hearing Mike Essa from DDE on that phone call? Would be an incredible collab!
maybe ecpsgroup from Poland may help
Can’t Freddie help out won’t his man know a guy 😂😂
Never give up matt you will get there  if not repair abl then sell parts to tavarish lol😂
And the country we are going to "Amsterdam" ( 1:05 )
A wrecked left hand drive McLaren with carbon damage, what could possibly go wrong 😂
No suspense ! Mat and his team are the best ! Sure we gonna have the most beautiful McLaren in the world ! Shall we bet ?
You may have to fly Tavarishs frame guy over.
MCsquirl living it luxurious
I'm sure you can lean on Tavarish and friends to help bring this basket case back from the grave
I saw that at Gravity. Gonna be some work
Amsterdam 2 hours flight ? It’s like 50 min flight ? From North east anyways
What happened to your ears?
Finaly a car from the Netherlands 😊 I hope that you are able to fix this one, as a dutch fan I really hope that you are fixing more cars!  P.s. When you are starting the lottery on you second channels plz added this time also your dutch fans!!!  Ron 🦊
😮 Never mind the McLaren - we now know Dad’s name… 🎉😊
Hey camera man stop saying "Tony" remember we don't know his name  😂
I wanted to take the piss when you said 'the country we are flying to... Amsterdam!!!' lol but then I remembered it's Mat Armstrong and I think more of you than to just blindly do that! This should be good to see xD
Fly the frame doctor over and get him to do it......!
And the steering wheel is on the correct side! ;)
Graham Eeles Composites will be able to repair that. He is an expert and you can be reassured you won’t see him in a suit and tie talking any crap.
When youre you tube channel is making so much money you don't honestly car about the re build cost :) fair play
just use duct tape and wrap ...as usual
Tony?
Yeah!! looking forward to this new series mate!  However, you do know though that Amsterdam is only the capital and not the entire coutry right ;-)
The fuse that blows when airbags go off has a simple fix get a bit of wire and stick it in where the fuse goes now it’s fixed XD unless it’s a smart fuse with a chip or something
1.1 mil views and only 70k likes come on people like what you view
Take the engine out and put it in something silly, that you'd never expect it to be in? 🤣
Will you beat Tavarish and build it faster? 😂
yoo the dads name is Tony. get leaked buddy
Im from the Nederland ❤❤❤❤😂
Looks like you need a Michael Essa 😀
Get a shell made for it like tavarish did shorly there's some one in the UK that can do it
I have to say. this is a big one that may backfire. never the less, i look forward to a great series on this car no matter the outcome. I loved the 3 guys on the phone, reminded me of the lone gunmen from x files. I know you will do what you need to make it a success.
This is great!, Keep the videos coming, unfiltered reality TV at it's best.  Even in the "failures" Mat is winning.
Fly Tavarish's friend out to repair it.
To be fair to the repair specialists and the Dutch company, this purchase was always about generating content. Matt probably makes a lot more money from Youtube than from fixing up cars. This is going to be very interesting project to watch, bring it on Matt😊
I hope the desperation lifts and you find an out..
As much as I love the super car rebuilds I do think he needs to still be doing cars that most of his audience find reachable. Golf Rs, Amg A class. Etc
1:04 'the country we're flying to.... Amsterdam' my dutch brain just exploded.
8:20 did Hannah mess up?
strip down and sell for parts... OR... be Matt Armstrong and make a plan... I think I know what's gonna happen though. Looking at the cockpit frame shell, that unit is pretty much a solid unit... I think those numbskulls at mclaren is simply saying no because they would get fired if they said otherwise. I think strip down time and then get your carbon fibre specialist to inspect the integrity of the cockpit shell... take it from there. i see a 720s cockpit shell for 5000usd on ebay.
Bit out there of an idea but I ride mountain bikes. And there’s people out there who repair carbon on mountain bikes. Bit of a project for them. But I’m sure it can be done
MEN, I LOVE UR DAD PERSONALITY
May maté always said never own horses or boats as they’re a money pit, think you can now add McLaren’s to the list…..😂
Nah that's BS the way they said no having barely looked at it, they could have said that just looking at the bloody photos!
No that was durch....
2min 30 in and id have walked away 😅😅😅😅
DDE are so nice and even more so for showing what a snake shmee is
Amsterdam is not a country
Talk to vtuned. He replaced the entire tub on his 720s. With a used one of course. You got this Matt!!
The Red Bull Squirrel proper tickled me 🤣
No.5 trending in Portugal!
dont use carvertical its a scam
That's gonna cost an absolute fortune to put right, thank god for car raffles eh
That carbon looks bad, and that side impact structure should not be repaired. Of course you can patch over it and maybe have a nice driving car in the end but the right thing would be to stick a new tub in there. Thats why is uneconomical to repair for anyone who has to sell it on without buthering it. If its not repaired right, this car should be a part out for the drivetrain and a few undamaged parts only... I think Matt knew from the start that no official source would repair crumpled carbon thats safety related...
Matt can fly freddy over and he can bring some usable parts 😂 this series is gonna be superb 💪🏼😎🤘🏻
"We can't assess it unless we see it in person". *Looks at it for 2 milliseconds* "Nah we cant fix it". I really think they should've been able to tell you its irreparable  from those pictures.
I'm afraid if you can finish this one, the next level is creating a car from junk.
McLaren Life hack at its best. ❤
This is going to be a fun rebuild to watch. At least you have some good references to tap into .. 60k though still seems  a bit steep for the damage your showing.  Good luck!
The country we're flying to? Amsterdam With how much convidence he made himself look stupid is phenomenal
Man.. what a project. Good luck with the carbon repair,  I did many composite repairs for KLM and know that it can be done although it requires real craftmanship and experience.
Guess you are flying Freddy's carbon guy out to the UK???
Matt’s dad name is tony. Secret have been revealed u guys
I'm hooked.....can't wait to see the continuation!!!
It's a good thing u have DDE and Tavarish as friends they good dudes snd mike essa and @tavarish will be a good help .. all the best Matt looking forward to see the new build
Ah… that was a rollercoaster of madness.  Well if the car isn’t salvageable maybe take the motor and put it into something else 🤣
TONNNNNNNNNNY! Matt’s dads name has been confirmed lol
saw this at gravity looked unrepairable
The Maclarens are already damaged out of factory... imagine a restored one...
Ok OPTIONS: 1. Find someone, anyone around the globe who can repair. (But from other comments I do t think that’ll happen) 2. New monocoque… 🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑 3. And my personal favourite. MA special KIT CAR!! engine and gearbox might need some work but drop that baby into a beach buggy or build a space frame chassis and fibre glass fat arch body and Boom 💥 💣 McLaren 720s kitcar!

Matt… Please never post a picture of WaxYourStrapon in any of your clips ever again, or we will have to part ways.
Amsterdam is 1 hour flight from London. Only 300 miles.
Much respect for you Matt from Bulgaria 🙏🤟
Company says they can only evaluate the car in person but knows they can't repair it the second he walks up to it. They definitely could have told you that isn't repairable from a photo.
The carbon repair guys could have told him they wouldn't repair it from a simple picture. Instead they make u buy it so they can see it in person for no reason. F for service right there.
10 years in F1 structural composites here if you need 💪🏼
Amsterdam is 1 hour flight from London.
@10:56 ... Tony .. Mat's dads name is Tony ... Now we all know. Winner winner chicken dinner :)
So dads called Tony 😜😜😜
tbh I wouldn’t have bought it, it seems to have structural damage making it a danger on the road, hope you can put it together into a usable state, but I wouldn’t push it too hard if I were you.
I cant believe you've bought this you mad lad haha, cant wait to see how this looks when finished
VTuned garage (Friends of Samcracc) fixed a 720s with a "similar" extension of damage and the result was spot-on... :-)))
Amsterdam isnt a country :D
That’s not german, that’s french hahaha
It's in german he says, while looking at french words 😂
Amsterdam is not a country, however the people who live there might give you the feeling it is
Can't u buy a new tub? Or are they impossible to get ?
Amazing you also show the hardships! I’ll root for a solution for you! :)
Well, in the worst case scenario you probably can get 60k pounds back if you sell the car in parts.
Mats dad's name is Tony  he said it twice
It's definitely youtuber McLaren rebuilding season....DDE 720 GTR, Tavarish P1 and now matt with the 720s...may the best electrical system win
Is it me or does this guy just revealed the name of Mat's dad as "Tony" ?!
Real Life Exotics has a guy that does carbon fiber repair.
He keeps asking where the oil is coming from!! Err the engine would be my best guess......
Love this guy, he is a unbelievable .
The doors have a emergency release inside behind the seat belt. I might of fitted that LH door
Ej Mat buy one flooded mclaren.. from 🇺🇸
Damn, pyrofuse was kinda easily found in this McLaren rather than on the 992 GT3💀
And if you could give any recommendations that would be helpful.
What is the best diagnostic tool to get for all cars? @matarmstrong
Awesome project - I swear you need a Tshirt in your merch line up that says 'Pyro Fuse!'
Wait his fathers name is tony?
Half the price because its half a car left ... don't get it how you got the balls & enthusiasms to go for disasters like these this is crazy (Tavarish kind of crazy) though
It wouldn't be to factory specs, but could you cut out a dovetail section and then put in your own many layers of a carbon fiber resin laminate patch?  Do many layers so the patch is overkill.
Bloody hell, that’s not looking good at first base … let’s hope you can find a solution 🤞🏻
Hi Mat, great video as always. Is the information provided by carVertical always correct and when its wrong is there any comeback?
Since when is Amsterdam a country? 😉
And the country we are flying to.. Amsterdam :D
:) this makes me so happy. Looking forward to (hopefully) more tavarish collabs!
Njoyed with a rock on the heart at the end.....;(
"do you recon it was 2 squirrels and they didn't like each other".... Brilliant
how come you get the chance of all theses bargains?
Parts car for another with a blown / damaged engine?
I got worried Tony wasn't gonna be in the vid.
TONY!!
A milli views in 20hours
Omg your videos are so addictive Mat ! I’ve been a petrol head since I can remember ! Had my first car (Escort XR3) at 13 yrs old and I messed, modified and tinkered in the garage ever since ! Problem is I’m supposed to be finishing off my house extension and you keep making me mess with the cars !! 😂 Keep up the good work 👍🏻 and the “I can sort that” attitude - 👍🏻
Am sure there is a tub on market place
Nice subliminal Porsche badge flash when referring to the pyro fuse!! 😆
please do a nissan gtr r34 or r35 build
If you need help watch DDE they have just started the rebuild on their 720
They said they needed to see it In person to decide if it can be fixed, so you buy it and take it to them only for them to look at it for half a second and say nah can't fix it. WTF!
But it’s left hand drive
Hay Matt ... If you look up B is for Builds.. Chris done fibreglass repair on his Lotus Evora a few years back... or a boat specialist....   . it can be done...  We have faith.
half of initial price is still a lot, not sure how much profit you can make
Time for a new carbon tub from McLaren!!!
You have always taken on fixable projects and done a great job. Unfortunately, with carbon patchwork the result can never truly be repaired. Carbon Fiber relies upon two-factor strength (inter and intra-laminer) due to tensile properties combined with layering. You will be able to make the repair look good, but that area will never contribute to a load ever again. For example, imagine a fiberglass surfboard that has broken in half and then repaired. It will always break in the same spot. Love the channel!
These videos are so addictive, love the story behind how you got to where you are now and the gamble you take on these cars...amazing stuff
Thought you would of gone for the 570s spider that is currently on CoPart at 36k ? And looks easier to repair 😂🤦‍♂️
"the dash board is in dutch " but it says french xd
His Dads name is Tony 🎉
The country we’re flying to? AMSTERDAM
I think you’re overwhelming yourself with too many projects!!!
Yeah I would like to see you attempt to fix carbon fiber as mat would say "it's a learning experience"
You should collab with gintani and make a 1200hp car
Got it :) Your dad's name is Tony right :)?
Put the car on a lift before you spend thousands of dollars!
Next up a certain Purple Pagani
I'm wondering what would be more challenging to fix, this carbon damaged Mclaren or the drowned Mclaren from Tavarish. Anyway, nice to see you working on a project which came from were i'am living. Maybe you can do a lottery selling in holland for this car, that would be great 🙂
Matclaren
Do you ever finish anything?
So, you gave up on the Ferrari?
so everybody is making sure to address Mat's dad by name now...
Where is the country of Amsterdam, do tell? :))
TONEH! TONEH! TONEH! TONEH! 😅 legend
What country is Amsterdam?
So the seller said they took it to McLaren and started the engine and tested the gear box? yet when Mat & Co started it, it pissed oil. Something doesn't add up.
If someone says in the intro ... I did big mistake... Then I know this was intended
The country?  ....Amsterdam!
📍His name is Tony!
Love these programmes 😊
Time to fly the frame doctor over.....😉😉😉
Mat can just watch DDE  now😂
If you can't fix the engine and other bits may be worth more than you payed.
Amsterdam isn't a country, lol
They could have stipulated the max repair size if they knew what was possible if it’s that black and white SMH
Today I found out Matt’s dad is called Tony.   Oh - great project as always 😂👏🏻
Should have baught the McLaren people a ticket. Would of been cheaper then buying the car. For future purchases. Take specialists with you.
The dashbard was in French mate (i am french)
Take note people,when mat say it's a mistake, it's usually not 😅
Amsterdam is a nice country 😂 excited for this build!
Fly tavarish’s mclaren repairer mate over. Probably only way
I got a dialogue:Strong is Armstrong
Transform that into a modern Batmobile supercar!!!  Too funny!  I had the Batman idea before seeing that logo on the spoiler.  I got the creators  concept!
If you have to part it out, go for the first ever BMW E24 /Mclaren swap! Ryan’s doing epic work on the bodywork…could be epic😂
I want one asap
Bit of Ramen & Noodles it’ll be right as rain!
This will be a fantastic build but I think Matt you well over paid for the Mclaren & most of the other builds which are not economically viable, but then you make  great content which covers the the over paying……keep up the good work….
Bin it. Find a less dinged 2007 Shelby GT500 in Essex, use parts to build a GT40 replica with real Shelby parts. You would end up with a new MA car that you could sell, would be a different build but still using your crash repair skills. No carbon, or weird electroncs. The thing is just a big Meccano set with a 5.4L handbuilt supercharged engine. A GT40 replica with the engine from the Ford GT would be cool, and you would get to bother Tavarish repeatedly for bits.
VTune had a tub that wasn’t as bad as that I believe don’t know if he still has it
whant more!! keep going
You keep calling it a McLaren. I would call it a collage of McLaren-style parts. Also, why the flip didn't the airbags go off?
The country we're flying to? -Amsterdam :)
He said mclaren had it running, yet it can't run because it is leaking oil 🤔 something doesn't add up to me. Love the videos
Amazing car, going to be a great build can't wait to see it up and running. You got this!!
O boy - this will be VERY VERY expensive but I'm looking forward to the more videos of your "new" McLaren 👍
Uuhh, that would be too bad for me ... even if it got repaired that will be a crashed car forever and never nearly worth 120k 😂
One million views in 20 hours! Wow.
If you managed to fix this car please help DDE fix theirs
You and tavarish = the mistake club
Ah yes, the country Amsterdam
hope you can fix it
Ohhh what a damage you have the rear end damage same with DDE's 720GTR... I think you need Mike Essa for this build...😆😆
Amsterdam is not a country😅🤣
Hi Matt, This will be a tricky repair especially with no access to the McLaren automotive ply 3d and ply book as we have no idea what type of resin system or prepreg carbon is used. I would be very surprised if they will ever approve any repair not drawn by their Design Office but you never know. I think your best bet would be to strip it back, have it Ultrasonically NDT tested for delamination's and have an experienced F1 contract composite design Engineer take a look. I can recommend someone that has previously carried out this in this type of work for a client In Brunei that unfortunately totalled a McLaren F1 a few years ago. let me know.
well that was a fast NO, i bet when fixed and you have someone else bring it to them for inspection so they think its a different car those muppets wont even spot where it was damaged
I love mclaren, but I know however Matt decides to build it, it will be 10x better than from the factory. When I was at mclaren the other day there was a P1 and boy was it rattling around. These things just aren’t built that well but I’d still buy one over something like a lambo😂 I love the brand end of😁
He said we can only do this big but he must of seen the pics before thay went down there what a melt
“The country we’re flying to: Amsterdam” 😂
put the engine in the Ferrari lol
Brilliant vid mat.   Your dad's an absolute genius and a beautiful soul 👌🤍
Good luck man THAT MCLAREN
Amsterdam is a country now?
My 1st thought was that's a good start for an artificial reef, then I remembered Tavarishs yellow submarine & thought again, anything is possible, this should be an interesting re build, best of luck.
MATT LOVE YOUUUUUU/ no homo btw just pure love
Good luck champ, I think you're gonna need it  👍
you got this mate. banger of a series incoming!!!
tony armstrong your dad name?
I've got to admire your positivity and upbeat mood when the odds are against you. This is going to get really interesting.
Fly out the flame doctor
Make it a custom GT version !!
Make a sick ass go kart! You’ll have the most expensive one ever made probably
Absolutely LOVE TONY!!!  He's off his head, what an absolute dude!
Yes, dutch people tend to be trustworthy, but if there's ever a car in Apeldoorn, and I mean EVER, DONT pick it up. I can explain you why, but that city is not right with cars. We're talking about false mileage, lying carsalesmen etc. Please take my word for it lol
no way he said mats dads name in the 15:05
Matt stop worrying you it's just like fixing a boat but with carbon fibre it's easy well not easy but you can do it If tavares got his P1 fixed you will be able to do that no problem you will probably have to keep the car yourself or send it back out the country and it will not show up
His name is Toni ??? 😮
6:35 as a dutch guy, you can tell by his body language and deminour he's probably being truthful 👍🏽👍🏽
“Reckon it was two squirrels.. and they didn’t like each other..” 😂
Its a MTCLAREN
prrce 60k noway it wasnt realistic i believe you paid max 30 40 k for it 60k purchase already good ones around 110 120 so its have to cost you max max 80 so you can sell damaged mclaren for 90 which not worth
I feel like Tarvish has already set the bar with this. How about some more common cars people would actually attempt themselves? Just an idea
Didn't the guy on vtuned channel change a tub on a MC720s, i am sure he could offer advice, just a thought
Fly that bloke over from the States that Tavarish used to fix his tub 👍
"The country we're flying to? AMSTERDAM."  Ah, the renowned country of Amsterdam 😄
Looks like an easy fix mate😂😂
I’m scared I’m gonna get an airbag in my face *covers face with the shirt*
Find 1 thats had a backend shunt.If you can replace the tub.Then job done
The suspension looks awkward on these obviously DDE I watch so good luck hope they sort it
I believe that the carbon frame is repairable, any carbon part can be repaired, it will probably be necessary to make a carbon part (using a vacuum chamber ) to place inside the frame in order to reinforce the destroyed area. Companies that make hydrofoils or carbon masts for sailing boats have this technology available, and can certainly make a very positive contribution to repairs. cheers
V-tuned on yt ended up getting a new tub for his 720 rebuild.
Not gonna lie McLarens especially the 720s have taken a beating recently
if mclaren does not touch stuff like that, and you repair this like you did the lambo well done 👏
First and do best?
Wait, he called matts dad TONY!?
what’s with the porsche logo
Man bought my dream car
A hope that yous guy fix this mclaren up can’t wait to c is bk on the road big fix but good luck 💯👌🏽
Is that Specialist car shop in birmingham ?
Jus a thought bug why don't you and tavarish build 1 wicked mclaren out of the 2 you got between you , uz 2 cud build a animal 😊
Good luck with this one, I hope you can get it sorted. 👍😊
Mat love ur content ur always some one who I will look up to love the videos and the big goals u achieve keep it up 👍
Mate, tavarish has a very good carbon guy he is using for years you can try your luck there!!!
Buy a new tub and then move everything over, thats what VTunes did, worked out fine and the replacement tub also came with lots of parts attached so he saved money that way as well.  Good Luck
Keeping positive, but this will be a tough and costly build. Can’t wait for the series
Esshhh, it’s mangled … stoked to see how this one turns out.
If you can't find a professional doing the carbon you might be better off selling it in parts, won't be a big financial loss if you include this video's revenue. I'd not mess with the carbon myself if it's important for structural integrity...
Has that Mclaren got the old Datsun V8 engine in it? I think a much easier way of starting the Mclaren is to put into 2nd and push 😊
I know you love a challenge and have pulled off some amazing rebuilds but I'd have walked away from that the instant I saw the damage to the tub.
Although McLaren won't touch it, for legal reasons I'm sure, strip it to the tub and speak to a carbon specialist. As long as you can get it structurally sound, and probably sign a waiver, you only need to get it through a test to make sure it's straight.
Gutted for ya
The country we’re flying to…Amsterdam
There is a 'tub' listed on ebay, not sure if it's any good for you Mat?
I'm glad to see you and Mclaren at Gravity show 🤟
Мет взялся , значит ожевит MCLAREN🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🇬🇧🇺🇦👏✌️💪👍👌😎
Heads up Mat. Go ahead strike it.
If you are buying it and the wing and the whole car body is damage so add a body kit in the kit
I've got a challenge, find an Aussie classic, Holden Torana or something like that
Definitely listen to Tony, take it back, it'll never be right 😮
Who’s Tony?
Walk away boys , walk away
We've seen you repair worse than this. Lol! I definitely think you can do it. I guess once you get it on a lift you can assess the damage on the tub from underneath too. But I have faith in you and your Dad. Just put that Maclaren shirt back on and you're good. Lol!😂Beautiful car too. Hope you can get your money back if not.🤷‍♂️Good luck Matt. 😅👍
12:00 it was in french lol
Двигатель диевле чем кузов .
is this going to be another MA/ Tavarish collaboration series ? i, for one , actually hope so , unless Freddies busy that is ,but he is the man with the McLaren connections now
Монокок повреждён сильно.
Matt, listen up!!! there will be somebody out there that can repair that tub, make a few calls  and somebody will give you a YES, I have no doubt in my mind that somewhere, someone can repair it. go on mate you can do this, we're all behind you on this. Pino from Australia.
Best of luck - it’s such a gamble tho
A McLaren... that's mental. Tavarish must be giggling knowing damn well what you've gotten yourself into.
The country Amsterdam
Get tavarish on the case and get the frame doctors number asap!!!
I would do one of two things, strip and sell the parts or buy another 720s in better condition and use either one as a donor car
'manufacturers'...   lol
Amsterdam is not a country!!!
No way that was started previously. Don’t trust the Dutch!
720s and 765's are my favourite mclarens
Mclaren car parts in Oxford near the mini factory I've done work for them mite help u out on the build Matt
I love Matts videos but why is nobody pointing out that he overpays tons for these crashed cars
Good luck with the suspension
Try Carbon repair UK
Hello Mr. Amstrong why don't you just buy another body and transplant the engine cant that work?
My current customer has, literally sat looking at it now.
The Dutch guy said Mclaren run the engine and tested the gearbox, did they not notice the oil pissing out the gearbox?????
Good luck dude
The DDE video call made me so happy. Good luck on the build, cant wait to see how this comes about :D <3
YOU LEFT YOUR DADS NAME IN THE VIDEO!!!!
You are amazing, I wouldn't pay even 1€ for a car In reality they should pay me to take the car out of the yard 😀
They break so much so fast.
Tony
It'll be reyt, as we say up north. Don't let us down, Mat.  :)
The cost of spares must be phenomenal?
"the country we are flying to: Amsterdam" 😂😂😂
Probably the worst car you have bought all mclarens should be scrap
One more good series 🔥
Tony!!!!!
Ask help (if you need of course) to vtuned garage, he completely rebuild his 720s
The country: Amsterdam. Mate your trips to the US seems to have some effects already...
Who is going to tell Mat Amsterdam isn't a country
When you casually call Mike Essa for advice......
This is going to be good series I reckon! Good going Mat! So much to learn for you really! You will get there in the end mate!
The country we're flying to? Amsterdam 😂😂😂
so sick
01:04 killed me :D but excitement level explains it. You are excused mate. Good luck with rebuild.
All carbon stuff can be repaired, just got to find the right person for the job
Bro's dad's name revealed again 11:07
Pretty sure that bloke could have told you the area they are allowed to repair over the phone
That Porsche badge flash was hilarious... :D :D :D
Whistlinsiesel has a low mileage Ferrari F8 that has some light damage you guys should get hold of it and repair that next.
‘The country we are flying to…Amsterdam’
1:03 The country we're flying to ? Amsterdam. 🗿
That laught is starting to get annoying
...of course Amsterdam is the capital city of the country The Netherlands.
Maybe @Tavarish can lend you his carbon tub? :)
engine oil need to be drained for this ?
That Verstappen slide up… 😂😂
@Mat I feel sorry for you on this purchase , @tavarish Man let him breathe ❤ 20:37
Give the Carbon Doctor an all expenses paid trip to the UK.
the country we are flying to AMSTERDAM 😂 thats a city 😜
Tavarish to the rescue!?
11:07 "Toy said..." we finally know Matt's dad name!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Halleujah!! 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
dad´s name is Tony!!!!!!!!!!!!
Dde ,MA ,tavarish all are fixing mclaren❤
🙈🚗You will find a way mat 💪😁👍
Another country -Amsterdam😅
Why don't you do a colab with Ant Anstead? He's capable of building race car from the ground up from scratch. You've got lots of parts including a great engine. Might be an idea?
What about the RS6 ?
Matt, this is another level! Really excited in watching you rebuild her. I’m sure that all those professionals telling you it can’t be done, will spur you on to prove them all wrong! HWBT!
Tony!!!!!!
I know somebody can fix the monocoque in austria
If you look on-line there are many people making carbon fiber parts for cars and boats. It depends on what is required to get it through any inspections and tests? Make a mould, get a vacuum pump, and try and find a McLaren repair procedure or someone in the carbon fiber business!!!! I am sure you will sort it and look forward to the videos…..
Do u ever finish a car, i only ever see you buying them 🤔
Bugger Matt! Not your first enormous challenge young Man! Surely you can exhaust all other options?
Don’t buy it donor body or that guy tavarish got his new body from ?
"The country we're going to Amsterdam" I don't know if Amsterdam is a country
Don't buy it just don't.
The way the repair company said no instantly... They could have confirmed this via a photo, no need to purchase and take it to them.  Looks like they played you for a free shoutout
Amsterdam is a country now?  who knew
V Tuned re-tubbed his…. Certainly end up with a better finished product
Pathetic that the McLaren specialists wouldn't tell you 'no' over the phone when you were in Amsterdam
The country we’re flying to “Amsterdam”
In the 650S tub, those side bolsters are the whole chassis, 720 tub added roof and rear extensions but still most of strength is in the sides - any damage is always an instant write-off. Tbh I don’t think any UK company would’ve sanctioned Tavarish’s carbon repair to the P1.
must be nice to have  £60k spare to buy a scrap mclaren
Mat disassemble it = the body and engine, then you are able 100% to get a read if someone can fix or not, when you see everything witch is wrong with it
If there is one bloke that can manage along with his crew, it's the MA crew... Go for it guys !!
im hoping this mclaren ends up white
Dang Amsterdam sounds like a nice country
what about RS6 GTR sema?
At 18 seconds he’s in a Chinese super car not the McDonald’s car just to let you know !!!
if anyone could fix this car, your the man
That Porsche badge killed me when talking about the pyro😂
Tavarish is rebuilding a P1 Meanwhile Mat is rebuilding a 720s
if anyone can.. you can, go for it Mat
MAKE A CAR TO KEVIN
Now this one boggles my mind. I have no idea what you will do
I’m sure Dads name has just been mentioned
The projects became bigger and complicater, good luck on this one Mat!
"The country we are flying to: Amserdam" 🤣🤣🤣
I was working with composites many years making competition boats and if you like I can help, I'm from Poland. Of course it's reparaible, just need to remove damaged carbon, add material around and with little bit of extra weight it will be as strong as before. Make sure to bond it straight and with right materials. In the shop they gonna do what Mclaren allow them to do which is bullshit and obviously just to scrap the car and buy new one.
saw that porsche flash for the pyro fuse bypass bit
Had you been to a good old Dutch coffee shop before you bought this one mat
‘They dont know had it is’ then laughs 😂
The MATCLAREN team will get it sorted !!
The answer appears to be a replacement tub - they come up occasionally on cars that are broken for spares. Swapping everything over would make a massive series!!!! Good Luck Mat - we're all behind you.....
Optimism is over 9000 here
Fastest video released.
Hopefully Freddy has some spares for you❤
His dads names Tony
If you get just a carbon specialist not a McLaren specialist, he could have fixed this probably
A friend of mine run an engine without the driveshafts in place and smashed the gear box.
Mat, love your videos! I'm Dutch myself. You mention the dash is in German, but that is French my friend.
If i remember correctly Vtuned got one and replaced the carbon tub
"The country we are flying to... amsterdam" 😂bruh
Hey!   Amsterdam is not a country but the capital! Also, it is a 1 hour flight but we are 1 hour ahead, so you arrive one hour later!   All good! Love the videos!
Its so stressful watching your videos sometimes lol
60k.. fark.. i thought it would have been 40k max
hey, you're really crazy. I stumbled across your channel a few weeks ago and watched almost all the videos. cracy how you have developed in such a short time. super sympathetic how your family and friends are part of every rebuild. the honesty and authenticity make the videos something special. it's so much fun watching you bring the cars back to life. keep on going - hard to believe what you can see on your channel. really unique
The tub can be repaired... they just wont do it. Gonna be a good build
Definitely over paid for it.
Amsterdam is not a country bro...
Ffs I wish I found your channel after this build was complete! I'm so eager to see more 😢
ok where is ferrari i dont want to watch this goofy ahh mclaren shit
TONY!! and mat new maclaren specialists 👌💪 yous two can do it
I love that blink of the porshe logo when you speak about the pyro fuse ^^
That's an expensive paperweight.
Love you Mat, and the content, but Amsterdam is not a country 😂
Matt pull that corner completely apart where the damage is take lots of close up pictures and send them to tavarishes carbon guy and get his thoughts either put car in container and get him to repair it in the america or fly him out and have him fix it at your unit or plan b buy another undamaged used tub but don't cut corners on it cheers from down under
Just keep an image of a 765LT lookalike on your drive and that should get you through 😂👍
I sense this car may end up in Florida.... especially being left hand drive.....cant wait to see the progress 👌
Amsterdam is not a country 😆 nice video though Matt!
This is a what's know as a "write off" Matthew 😅
Left hand drive 🎉
Tony!
Mat, Amsterdam is not a country :) The Netherlands is, and Amsterdam is the capital city :)
“The country we’re flying to: Amsterdam” 😂
Finally a car with the steeringwheel on the correct side. Being a Dutchy, please make a lottery for it when your done and sell the tickets in The Netherlands. (that's a hassle). Great channel and looking forward to your work.
if the engine is good you should put it in something else
bro this shit box has a Nissan engine in it
15:35, Mat says Obama
What’s with the back pack vest thing
Mat, Mat, Mat what have you done 😮😮😮😂😂😂😂 If its even possible, thiswill be an epic build. Now the race uis on between you and @tavarish to see who finishes first, if at all! Good luck dude, hope it works out 🎉
As someone from the Netherlands I never knew Amsterdam was a separate country.
How much is a new tub because I've seen a video where someone replaced the tub
Well life is about taking chances and this is another big challenge for you to fix Mat, but I'm sure you could tackle this one, yes Mclaren can be very difficult to get spares from (just ask Tavarish Freddy) but hopefully there are enough spares to get this one back on the road again....
Mat, your content is 🔥. But I have to say. That quotes a shocker... "the country we are flying to..... is Amsterdam" 😂🤦‍♂️
“Need to see it in person”….within seconds of seeing the exact same thing the photo showed they say no. -_-
We need a paro fuse t-shirt😂❤
McClaren may be the pinnacle of UK engineering. Worth it, you have a great team behind you.
Dutch people tend to be trustworthy = Picture of Max Verstappen ROFL!!!! Laughed a lot at that!!
Patch the tub, rub a dub!
At this amount of impact the frame is surely twisted. Complicated case.  5000£ ? Never ever! 😄 I think 60.000 was wayyyy too much for that pile of trash.
What are the odds that Mat gets a body kit for this from the same place Freddy did? Is about to be an interesting new build
Good luck, Mat. I'm sure you will come up with an idea to get it back on the road,
Those carbon repair guys should have told you from the start that it was not repairable (by them), the damage was clear in the photos. After hearing what they said, its obvious they wouldn't repair it.
Is this really the same guy that fixed an Audi TT in a carpark 🤣 absolute madness!!! Love it!!!
You happen to know someone that's after all of the parts you have if worst came to worst I'm sure Freddy tavarish would take it off your hands
bit of gaffer tape all sorted
Hey matt do some vids striping the car and selling the parts, would make for good watching and £s back
Best content on YouTube!
Just looked, 35k for a new carbon tub 😵 guess this was a huge mistake, hopefully you can make a lot from the videos because its going to cost the same as a good condition used car
can't wait for a part 2
if i buy a savage title amg gtr would you be interested to work on a project in canada?
13:29 Mat's Dad name has finally been revealed 🎉
Send it to Poland, we can fix everything. But no jokes. You can find specialized companies in Poland that repair carbon cars.
What happened to the M3 I heard about ? Or did I get it wrong ?
Looks like we now know it dad's name hey tony
His names Tony!! Haha
Tony
Great attitude to constant challenges - much to learn for us all watching this.  Good luck with this project Mat and team
Keep it up bro❤
No way he bought that without knowing they wouldn't repair the tub - good acting though 😜
Forget the Moneypit Keyring will need a full size giant Moneypit sign for this one!
Did you just name drop your dad!!!
Wondering if its $60,000 in parts.
Just because they won't doesn't mean you can't... This is going  to be sick when it's finished that I have no doubts
Those repair dudes couldnt see that from a foto?
Bit of t cut it will be fine
This is so frustrating about the carbon repair . The mclaren repair company said they had to see the damage in real life before they could give you their assessment … but why the hell couldn’t they at least say ‘ oh btw if the damage is larger than a drinks coaster we can’t touch it ‘ . Ridiculous for ya lad
Good to see you talking to DDE about their MClaren build.  Its exciting to see the 2 builds being done together.  Fingers X you can get this thing off the ground.
Gutted
😵what a wreck  mc laren!man what a challenge again !i cant wait to see the next video!
You're a brave man @Mat Armstrong I feel confident you'll find a solution, I mean you always do, so... 😎😎
Amsterdam is a city, not a country :D , the country is the netherlands
Can I have the broken carbon ceramic please lol
When Mat uploads we all happy ❤️🔥
Ah yes the country of Amsterdam. :D
Awesome video ❤❤❤❤❤
The country we're flying to: Amsterdam 😂
Amsterdam is the capital city of the netherlands haha, its not a country
Amsterdam is not a country it's the Netherlands or Holland and the capital is Amsterdam thank you
Matt, with your depth of knowledge and experience I'm sure you knew the answer from the approved repairer was always going to be 'no'; they would always rather sell a new tub that repair as they have to be bullet proof later on if someone decides to sue. Looking forward to seeing the repair process when you find someone with the right 'can do' attitude.
"The country we are flying to, Amsterdam" - goodbye Dutch audience
Absolutely incredible from Audi TTs in a car park to Lambos, Ferrari and now McClaren! What a journey Mat 👍🏻
I just got back on to your videos. 1.7m subs!!! Well done mate. So pleased you are doing something you love full time and your channel is doing well. Keep up the good work .
Love the fact it was Mike Essa on the DDE phone 😂
Matt,  hope you don't keep following the crowd....you dont need supercars to make great content .....theres quirky builds out there 🙌👍
Matt, what about the guy from the US that fixed the cracks in the underbody of Tavarishs McLaren? He might be able to fix this one too! He's a genius! Phil
I think you need a box of Swan Vesta, bud! Lol, Brave man to take this on, good luck!
The staff at that garage are real jobsworths!
Strip it out and send it to the guy who repaired tavarish' one.
the dashboard was in french 😂😭
Why don’t you fly the carbon guy over from the US. Surely he can fix it.
Matt, talk to Tavarish there might be a repairer in the US that can guide you through the repairs. You did the BMW and you hadn't repaired on of those...
Really exited to see how you will come around with this build... And I'm sure you'll do the impossible. ❤
Amsterdam isnt a county mate, pleassssss
its not german but french ;)
As the saying goes, anything mechanical can be repaired
If Mat pulls this one off it will be his biggest achievement to date by a country mile. I'd love him to be able to get the carbon tub repaired in order to stick it up the fat git at McLaren that took one look at it and arrogantly wrote it straight off without being an ounce of help to Mat......................Go on Mat prove McLaren WRONG.
There are more companies that know how to fix Carbon fiber structures, and are willing to fix it: F1,race sailing, super yacht builders/ tender builders…or just sell the car again😆
the way mat laughs when he realizes something is bad is so consoling 😂😭
Hope you can find a way to fix it 😊
Lying MAX
I know you will fix this 💯😉
This is the most hardest car repair on this new episode 🫡.. . 21:09  wooo!hoooo!.. 💪💪💪  there many way to fix it.. gogoGo McLaren.
🔥🔥🔥
You caught the Freddie syndrome.
mats dads name is TONY!!!
Tony is his dads name
There must be a frame doctor in the UK, if not, fly the one from the states over
There’s a tub on eBay for £35,000
Wow that one going to take a lot of t cut to sort looking forward to see it get done.
Tonnnnnnnyyyyyyyyy
Matt, you’re an absolute mental case, but we love your enthusiasm 😂
Matt you might have do what vtune did get tub and do swap if you can
Amsterdam is not a country 🙄
Looking forward to this man! Good luck 👏🏾❤️
McLaren is fun to drive but pain to build and fix
BUT FOLLOW MY COMMENTS ABOUT WHAT TO DO TO SAVE THE TITLE FROM TURNING FROM TOTALED WHICH CAN BE REG’D AND INSUR’D TO TURNIN INTO DEEMED NVR TO BE ROAD LEGAL AGAIN MY OTHER COMMENTS TELL U HOW TO AVOID THAT AND WHAT NOT BUT DONT BUY ANYTHING TILL U FIND SOMEONE THAT CAN REPAIR RHE CARBON TUB EVEN IF ITS GOTTA FLOAT TO THE U.S FOR SOMEONE TO DO IT ITS WORTH IT WIT THE PURCHASE PRICE. OR 20-40K TO FLY IT TO THE US LIKE DDE DID HAHA. ULL GET IT DONE BROTHA.
Fair play to you Mat always challenging yourself
If there is a size criteria on what they can repair, why didn't they give you a straight answer from the pictures !
Swap the Mclaren engine etc into a 911, don't think that's been done before.
It's amazing how optimistic you are even when facing such an adversity. Honestly, you're definitely one of the most inspiring Youtubers out there because you show people it can be done even when the whole world might say it can't.
Get a donor car and swap everything over as per VTuned and his Mclaren build.
“If McLaren can’t fix it, I’m a new McLaren technician” - Mat Armstrong 2023 😂 Proper excited to watch this build unfold 🔥
Make it 1of1
we need the rs6 build finished!!!!
The country we're flying to....  Amsterdam 😂
Honestly, I think parting it out and sell as spare parts might be a better route to go.
Is it £60k? Really?
VTuned on repeated, it time to find a carbon tub, and replace it.....
Nice project, but Amsterdam is not a country it's a city :P
Loved the pyro fuse joke 🤣
YES MATE CAN'T WAIT FOR ALL THE VIDS ON THIS BUILD <3
Amsterdam is not a country LOL
If you got invited to gumball again you should take this
Crazy that McLaren won’t help. But they will charge the absolute earth for parts and yet they are not the most reliable cars on the market at all.
finally i know mats dads name 😂😂😂😂😂
I am confused on how Mclaren supposedly started the car with the pyrofuse in as well as tested the gearbox (that apparently is leaking?!)
I work within the composites industry, my colleague and I could look at repairing it for you? Our company currently manufacture tubs for a prestigious automotive company in the south.
Camera man loves a disaster
You mean a Dutch scvivel
Amsterdam is not w country
Go to Poland ,we Fix this ❤
This one is going to be interesting !
Fly the American repair guy to the UK
I work in Sheffield and am the QC of MCTC and even I wouldn’t attempt to repair that tub 😅
Wish was so easy to buy cars like these in South Africa
Amsterdam isn't a country, lmao 😂😂
I'm quite sure it will go like this: Tavarish:" I got s spare 720s monoqouque just laying around, you can have it, no biggie."
Sorry mate - Amsterdam is not a country. Also worth noting is that the Netherlands is one of the best places to be seriously ripped off on the continent - Dutch people are NOT trustworthy at all. The dashboard seems to be in French. Strange video this one but I'm here for the positivity😘
Please don’t ever change your outro song. Gives me good vibes every time I hear it
So it is TONY, now we know the answer, thank you cameraman Mat! 😂
When the company repair tech takes one look and asks "You want to what?" Then falls down laughing. You might want to rethink your choices.
Amsterdam is the capital, the country you flew to where the Netherlands✌🏻
Loved this video Mat, i really enjoy the camaraderie between you all and your dad Tonys personality is shining through now he is less camera shy.  Looking forward to the next installment 😊
All I can say is I have faith in you. Im interested on the next video.  This is going to be a success.
Ahh yes, the country of Amsterdam... Known for Amsterdamese people and such... They speak Amsterdamish, right? C'mon, Mat!
Hmmm it’s  long shot but speak with Carbon Tech in Manchester.  Repairs damaged carbon fibre bikes maybe they could help with this
Surely got to get the carbon guy who Freddy used over? Might not be ‘approved’ but you’ll know you’re still getting a quality repair! The fix he did on the P1 was unreal! Can’t wait to see it all come together! 🤙🏼
The country of Amsterdam. Wonderful :p
Did I hear Matt's dads name is Tony!? FINALLLYYYYY!! WE HAVE A NAME!!
WAIT THEY JUST SAID MATS DADS NAME AT 13:29 ITS TONY!!!!
The mclaren dealer let it run with a oil leak !!!
Bargekop
They did'nt say they could not repair it they said they are not allowed just nead to find someone who is good with carbon
Amsterdam is not a country mate 😂
Goes to a dutch speaking country, sees the on board computer configured in French : oh no it's in German!😢
Somethings do go beyond repair, you may well need to replace nearly everything on this one... I would part it and move on.
Stitched up by the McLaren technicians saying you need to buy it before a decision can be made for a repair.....Technician literally looked from a distance and in less than 5 secs shook his head a picture or two could of got the same “ I don’t want anything to do with it “ result......
How positive can you be!??? So great to see the optimism
Looks like that tub is going to the U.S and back? Do an exchange scheme shipping McL to America and Porsche’s to the UK getting people what they want!!
Tis but a scratch
Don't give up man, we're all behind you on this one bro @matamastrong
from never saying mat's dads name to saying it 100 time in one episode, looking forward to this one
We need some "Listen to Tony" tee shirts :-)
Big challenges makes big mens !    Just need to find a carbon specialist now ^^ and a solution to verify the straight of the carbon cell
They could have given you an opinion from a photo if that was the depth of the review. Deffo get other opinions. Good luck ❤
Halfords must do a DIY carbon fibre tub repair kit. Few pop rivets and some black paint, sorted.
It will buff out with enough elbow grease.  Tavarish would be an expert by now in this.
Amsterdam… not a country, yo!🤦🏻‍♂️
Funny enough I equally guessed 5k pounds repair tag. Guess you are welcome to join @tavarish in the McLaren build 😂 let's see who gets his built first Mat or Tavarish
poor poor guy
Thought the guy said mclaren did run it 😅 anyways, gonna be an entertaining build with some good content. Hope you get it fixed!
Dad’s name reveal alert!!!
No stress Tony will fix it
German? 😂😂😂😂
MATT BEFORE U TAKE IT TO MCLAREN FIND OUT IF THEY HAVE THE LEGAL POWER TO LABEL IT NEVER TO BE ROAD LEGAL AGAIN AND THAT MAKES IT UN INSURABLE/REGISTERABLE LIKE SOME STATES IN THE U.S CAN DO THEY CAN DEEM A CAR NVR TO BE DRIVEN AGAIN UNLIKE BEING LABELED TOTALED U CAN LEGALLY REGISTER AND INSURE IT AND STREET DRIVE IT AGAIN. BUT IF ITS DEEMED NEVER TO VE DRIVEN ON THE STREET AGAIN ULL NEVER BE ABLE TO REGISTER AND INSURE IT AGAIN. FLORIDA IS A BIG STATE FOR THAT IF U SEARCH THRU CO PART FOR REAL BAD WRECKED CARS ULL SEE WHAT IM TALKING ABOUT IN THE TITLE STATUS AREA!!!
Mat you are next LEVEL!!!!!!
This is a 'Car B ' breaker only and cannot be put back on the road , The Dutch seller is a lying toe rag when he said that the engine runs and MClaren will not sell you any bits ,quite rightly . Its a breaker and you may just about get your £60K back stripping and parting it out .But it makes for mindless YouTube content and you get paid either way . In  the real world its worth £40 K .
Best you get a Xerox t shirt,  to help repair the photocopier model 720s... sorry but mclaren cars just have no character or charisma... its an expensive white goods.
Your Dad's name is Tony, Hanna just mentioned it 😊😊😊
I saw this week on Saturday and it looks look a challenge. It was great to meet u on Saturday and see the cars sorry I just stop to say hi when u was so busy
MATT IF U DECIDE TO PART IT OUT DDE WILL BUY THE SEATS AND OTHER STUFF!!
MATT EVEN IF U CANT GET IT FIXED WHICH U CAN EVERYTHING POSSIBLE AND BEEN DONE OR WILL BE DONE BUT U HAVE ENOUGH PARTS TO GET UR MONEY BACK JUST STORE IT COVERED AIR TIGHT AND CHECK ON THE INTERIOR ONCE INA WHILE FOR MOLD.
My dad used to say: can’t fell off the bus long time age  Fix it and start a new trend👍🏻
McLaren shop saying no and that nervous laugh from Mat means challenge accepted 😂
MATT EVEN IF ITS NOT FIXABLE BY MCLAREN SOMEONE WILL STILL BE ABLE TO FIX IT EVERYTHING POSSIBLE AND BEEN DONE!!
Lol! You picked this car up in Twijzel! That’s so close to where I live, a shame I didn’t know 😢
So dutch guy lied to you he said dealer had it running and checked gear box !!!!???never take anyones word when buying a car especially the seller!!!!ROOKIE MISTAKE
Hey that’s not wrecked that’s just standard maclaren build quality
As Hammond would say " you're a mad man " but cant wait to see how it comes out
Looking forward to next episode!
Strip the tub down, Obviously no one can see the extent of the damage to the tub right now! But there are people in Germany who do wonders with carbon race car tubs..
Did they just call matts dad Tony???
MATT not even 1/2 way through your vid yet Wow, this is going to be a good one mate
They having a laugh, they couldn’t say that from a photo and wanted to see the car… wasted your time taking it to them. Good luck!
This challenge bring Matt to the next level. When is matt going finish the Ferrari rental he bought?
Carbon doctor will sort that scratch out no problem! 👍
Amsterdam is NOT a county !!!!
You like Nick from Jake paul's crew. England is my city, But this time is Amsterdam is my country. Joke aside love your vids😇
Really excited for this build!
So McLaren started it and ran it did they? Sure they did. Cheeky Dutchy.
My dad go the same tattoo as you
😮
DDE is in the virtual house!
He took the gamble, what a madlad
This is the part where you prove everybody wrong.
How come we don’t see Liam anymore?
you can almost always trust Dutch people
Don't do it
The McLaren repair place is out of order. How can they say they needed you to bring the car the them and within seconds say “if the repair in the area is bigger than “this” they can’t touch it”. Are they telling all your fans they could not have done a FaceTime video call with you to tell you that before you bought the car? They are bang out of order. Please prove them wrong!
McLaren 720s is the best looking McLaren in my opinion I just love how it looks since it came out the senna looks and is amazing and there are obviously lots of amazing cars but I love the 720s when it comes to McLaren
Finally 2 of my Fav channels both rebuilding 720s @Mat Armstrong & @Daily Driven Exotics
Knowing that conventional replacement part and repair costs are insane, it blows me away that Supercars in this sort of condition still attract the used price they do. If not for the likes of Mat Armstrong, who would buy them?
One thing I’d recommend, is talk to DDE and Mike Essa. He’s been helping rebuild their 720 GTR and he’s understood some things about the car that the average guy wouldn’t know.  Especially about the rear, and the rear suspension being charged with hydraulics.  All the best for the build Mat!  Edit : I just saw that you talked to Mike! This is going to be a good build
Wo another monster series have to complete to me💘⚫
Cool car
Good Luck
DDE
Wow a new project I am so excited, this is a DIY project obviously
Surely Amsterdam isn’t  the country??  But kudos for try to fix this car.
15:33 You can hear how worried Mat is. Looking forward for a next episode!
U keep laughing..that's great guy's 😂😂
Wooww, it's going to be great project and videos for us to watch... You got this Mat :)
Tavarish might need a few flights over for this one to help!, on his build he had the whole body panels replaced by a UK company, maybe they can help?
Clown activity detected. Buddy says pictures won't cut it and has you bring it all the way over only to glance at it and immediately say no like it was plainly obvious. I'd be heated.
*that some random mclaren “specialist” wouldn’t fix - not mclaren
14:08 WHEN THE PORSCHE THIBNG CAME UP WHEN HE BOUGHT UP PYRO FUSE MADE ME DIE OF LAUGHTER HAHAHA
Well they could’ve said they couldn’t repair it on the phone!!!
You could see that the damage was significant to the carbon tub from the pictures. To have you buy the car, bring it to them to tell you they can only repair small damage and it's not repairable. Ridiculous
And the sellers said that the gairbox and engine were fine en did run by the mclaren dealer after the damage.. 🙈🙈🙈  i thinks some one was lying😂😂 . But keep up the good and nice works Matt 👌💪💪
I can’t wait to see how this one goes.
You have the skills mat! You can do it!
Plan B is to find an alternative way of repairing the smashed tub.  Plan C is just scrap the car for parts.
Ahhhhh who doesn’t know the beautiful country of amsterdam 1:04 😂 But honestly I’m hyped for the rebuild 🙌🏼 can’t wait to see you taking on harder and harder challenges 💪🏼
Why not fly over tavarish  guy to fix the carbon 👌
McLaren is not carbon... It's carbon plated glassfibre doors.
Walkaway from the mclaren ,more damage will show up if you break the car down to the monocoque tub
How the Dutch guy is sure that engine runs if pyro is broken?
„The country we‘re flying to…. Amsterdam“ just hilarious.
Oooopsy
It's a McLaren,that alone is a challenge set down by their own thinking ,and there are a few taking up that challenge to say the them ,stuff it we will give it a go ,won't or shouldn't be impossible as they themselves started with ideas ,dreams and inspirations. Mat ,Tavarish ,DDE ,and others who are tackling damage with the same  vigor ,and the more and more others learn about McLaren DNA ,the better the end results will be,after all it's just a Car ,built by other humans  McLaren might be protecting interlectual property rights ,but they are not winning any favourite those wishing to keep these cars going , reluctance to offer any assistance hints to a touch of arrogance,all this does is fuel the passion for others to conquer what is being said as not possible . Go Mat and helpers
Well if Ben from Vtuned can rebuild his you can do it too!
I have a funny feeling Tavarish's friend is getting a call from the UK
HE LEAKED THE DAD's NAME
Your dad's name is tony😂
Man this one looks pretty much impossible, gamble on if the tub and frame is damaged too
I think you’ll find Amsterdam is a city, not  a country. 😂
Father's name is Toni  😂😂😂
Looks lovely, just a shame it’s left hand drive
CRAZY !
Well guys. I used to work for a carbon/glass fiber factory in Holland and we produced the front Mercedes/McLaren crash cones. Those are braided parts, so they are not repairable!. If your damaged parts are 'patched' you can repair them without losing their strength. Braided parts can not be repaired without losing their original strength! Cheers Nico.
Loving this potential new build....on a side note, what's with the shoulder/back 'man-bag' holder?😂
me looking at the car thinking is this even fixable?damnn😁
where is your green lambo.. 1 month and no video WTF must i come there and do it my self
Dear Mat, next time you're in the Netherlands, you must pop in for a coffee, tea, or Yfood!  I can also lend you some tools if needed. ;)
Ahh yes, the country Amsterdam. Nice there. Joking, keep up this mega content
Time to ship it to America boys!
TBH saw same bad damaged on gravity and and for me is not road legal that repair.  As its the main body of the car. USA got diffrent law they can anything 😂 but here dont think so :(
New series lfggg 😤😤(brev need update on da Ferrari brev)
Good fking luck mate
Finally 😍😍😍
Country is Holland, and city is Amsterdam.
In three years he'll be buying just the headlight that's still working and rebuild the entire car around it at this pace
Hi :):)
PYRO FUSE FTW
I would find a shell and see if I can save the motor on a swap
These edits are getting better and better! Can’t wait for pt. 2!
I definitely think it was two squirrels 🐿🥜 they didn't like one another ! 😂
And you bought this car😱 you are a legend if you get this car on the raid again! 👌🏻
I liked the flash on the pyro fuse discussion lol
Dudddeeee you called DDE just like that 😢❤ woah ! It's crazy how far you've come dude, what an absolute legend you are Mat🎉
you're crazy 😂 bro👍👍👍
Well good news I am sure DDE can use some of the parts off that for their rebuild
The motor and trans alone is a profit!
For a normal person, this ain't worth it, but for content, it'll be good! 😂
How I wish the complete build was up already 😩
I see your videos from india and i love  your video how you repairs crashed cars and you enjoy repairing it
This is going to be a great build ❤
you should watch the DDE videos on thier crashed 720 gtr parts are crazy expensive
Listen to your dad and take it back! There are so many other more feasible repairs you could be tackling on other cars that are just as cool. This car is just gonna be a money pit and heartache. It will be more satisfying for you and us to see another car saved that wont be such a nightmare.
I specialize in carbon fiber repairs on aircraft….its fixable…
Damn didnt even know you was here😂
Wow i would have walked a way when i saw the carbon damage on the doorsill. Im glad your not me because my video would be shit 😂
DDE can barely fix theirs and it has less damage then that I think. Wait bro, how did they start it without a radiator! Good luck!
uve got some balls tackin that  supercar on mat, on your next  video youle find the razor in the bathfoom cabinet behing the untouched shaving cream
Atleast its not flooded 😂😅😊
Here we go again yippee. 💪
You can do iiittttt!
Good luck with the Mclaren Matt but think you'll have more luck winning the lottery than getting that sorted. All the best for the build looking forward to seeing g how get on with it 💰😏
Welp, guess you're just going to have to ship it to @tavarish lol, let the frame doctor to do some magic
Mattttttt, kita buat dia. apa ada hal.
15:55 HIS NAMES TONY!!!
It's a McLaren the engine is broken from the factory.
His name is Tony?
Come bro, you can do it. I am watching your videos from INDIA. Repair it fast and post videos here Can’t wait to see it running again on the road😊
Damn Mat you know so much that you know what gearbox oil smells like??
All silence for the Mercelago.....
Talk to some boat builders, plenty of major carbon fibre repairs/alterations  being done on performance boats these days. Didnt the seller tell you the engine/gearbox was run up after the crash??   Perhaps a bit of a refund due ??
let this be a paced one and not count every piece of squirrel poop in every episode…
Didn’t  @tavarish need it an Engine for his Maclaren ? ..hereeee it is !!
You will be right matt you will get it fixed
I was hoping your next project would be a Lamborghini Urus but I’m not mad at this too.
Surely McLaren repairer could have told them that over the phone 😅
Who bets MA will beat Tavarish at fixing a Mclaren. Let the race begin.
How did the dealer supposedly run it with a bad pyro fuse? - dodgy Dutchie alert!!
Is that Ton Nei my lost long friend ?
Track car!!!
The DDE is awesome
The big take away is Matt's dad is called Tony!
The Windows XP error noise at 0:52! I'm dead.
@mattarmstrong AZ cycle parts sells used super car parts check them out they have Mclaren parts
Definitely reach out to Freddy
Matt: where's the oil coming from Matt's dad:From engine...😂😂😂
Big up DDE
Well the seller doesn't like himself very much , happy to be on camera talking porkies about McLaren techs running and testing the engine and transmission.  What a dooche bag move .
Tony who dat? Is that’s your dads name finally?
Time to fly it to the US to go to The Frame Doctor
Every time MA buys a new wrecked car. “ I just bought this car, but I think I made a big mistake” 😂
Looll did y’all see the Porche logo flash?? Hahahaha😂😂😂😂
Did anyone hear that Matt dad name was revealed!!!!!
Damn that going to cost a small fortune to fix
Mat do anything with the car but never ever change its alloys😑
Thanks matt Armstrong I'm living in Australia in a garage with my car I'm building and I watch your videos at night on my tablet they inspire me to get me project finished. Love your videos. And if u ever come to Australia would love to see ya mate
No way 😳🔥🔥
YES MAT
Matt’s dads name is Tony??😮😮
Tarvish you will have to look after Mat now hope to see you over there helping him ha keep up the good work boi,s
Awesome!! Another project🫡
wow - this looks so bad, looking forward to seeing how this does or does turn out, good luck mat !!!
Big leagues now Mat😮$$$$$$. Best of luck👍
You always say you have made a mistake you havnt your a genius brother plus you got Tarvish dont stress your a legend
Epic
Naaaaa he will fix it on budget I know
Matt’s is crazy brave to have bought this car. However as always he manages to repair it.
Love the cheeky Porsche thumbnail that may or may not have flashed when talking about pyro fuses 😅
Damn!!
Guess your seller lied to you
This is going to be some project but im sure you are up to the job, maybe try reaching out to thornly motorsport they might know someone who can help with the tub,  Mclaren approved were never going to put their name to it
What happened to your old bmw whose body was getting rust
Tavarish needs an engine, you need a tub. Jelly wrestle for the part you need, winner takes all.
Take it apart to see if it's really so bad. Go again to repair shop or send them pictures. Find someone else who can fix it. Try to find new unibody. Don't give up yet, there a lot of things you can make before that. Good luck and I can't wait to see what next.
Dear Matt. I'm watching one of your older videos.  This has to do with your front diff on your Gallardo. Where you pulled it put to make your Gallardo rear wheel drive. What I'm getting to is your generosity to the ambulance student and the 1500 pounds you gave her... you got class my friend and a truly wonderful heart. I live in the USA. And honestly I'm more a truck person. My dream truck is a Ford f150 limited. It's the cream of the crop for ford pickups. Or the shelby f150 supersnake. Which I'm actually in a drawing for on goonzquad. On YouTube. Anyway. I'm hoping I get one one day.. more like praying I can get one. I'm 58. A retired army veteran and working my butt off. But hey I'm proud of what you did and it shows your love and compassion. Give Kevin a hug and give Hanna a hello for me. Sincerely   Chris
V-Tuned In Tennessee had to swap out the tub on his 720 maybe you can find one and do that. Good luck. Love you videos!
It wasn't batman's car?
Not sure why you tried to start that 😂
That is a hard fucking fix with the carbon fiber, Good luck!!!
8:20 Tony is the name 😂 finally i know
Shout out to Tony!
There's GOTTA be a carbon repair guy in the UK. HAS TO BE .i belieeeeve
Shout to DDE and Mike Essa. I'm glad you were able to reach them. I have faith that you can fix this beast. Let's get it. Can't wait to see the progress.
So excited! If Tavarish has taught me anything, Maclarens are expensive to repair, period. I hope you can find a way to repair it with a budget!
I wouldn’t buy it. There’s going to be so many unseen damages. By the time you spend the money to fix it you could’ve just bought a better one.
Tear it all the way down and repair what you can and then start looking for replacement parts.
Bring it to Florida
The big mistake was thinking Amsterdam was a country :)
does anyone know the outro song to his vids?
gonna have to fly it to the USA or to Russia,  both locations can fix the tub
Looks like you’re going to be flying @tavarish ‘s guy out to do some work..
Looks like this might be your track car after all is said and done
Someone explain to me how the airbags not gone off 😂
Matt can do it, just you watch.
You should watch DDE’s 720s rebuild for some help.
Such a cliffhanger. I’m surprised tavarish didn’t scare you away from these
Strip it for parts?
Bro you can fix that based on what tavarish did alone. Have faith!
Part that out. It's screwed.
I laughed when you said " The Dutch are pretty honest" !
TONY🎉
Fly Tav's carbon guy out
Just got your dad name😂❤️
Walk , run away
I do love you May but as a geowizard fan and a geography nerd, 1:04 did hurt me😂
Caman Matt! Country where you went was Netherlands and city was Amsterdam.
Couldn't you sell it for parts, Mat? just to recover some of the cost that you brought it for.
😊
So what's the ACE you have hidden Mat?  Spare tub I take it.
Mat looks at dde’s crashed 720 videos it’s almost identical to this except the door
That Dutch guy selling the car was totally honest the engine did run b4, albeit before the accident.
how is that worth even half the price?
Fly out the gent who did tavarish’s tub
Matt would go to the car wreckers watch a car get crushed and still fix it. 😂
They immediately said no....but couldn't give you an answer until they saw it? That's lame. Felt like a picture would have wirked for that response.
@dailydrivenexotics 😅😅😅
U sure about this one?  Ask for a huge discount on top of whatever he offered
Well this could potentially be the quickest series yet 😅
So is dad’s first name Tony if I heard that??? Now what? £60K - - part out the car or - or do an unauthorized repair…. Nasty dilemma.
You are my hero
Mike essa the goat!
Not sure why the repair team said they needed to see the car and then just instantly said NO. Could have done that from a photo or video
I'm only here for Tony
WHEN DID YOU NOT MADE A MISTAKE??
Do it Do it Do it
Thanks to gumball these two channel are connected..nxt gumball will be asia!!!! Hope matt is joining!! Welcoming frm Singapore
Now, instead of trying to do goofy things like start and drive it before you fix it, take it apart! I wanna see all the bits.
Puts, to muito tranquilo da vida, "vou ali comprar uma mclaren moida".
Strip it down to the tub, send it to Florida and get it repaired there 😅
I appreciate you Mat for taking on all these amazing projects that others won't. Owning a McLaren like this is such a dream. I'm so looking forward to this build and what you are able to do with it.
You could fixed dde McLaren gtr
What happened to the mercy bro I hope its alr
You can buy a 720 mclaren tube here is the YSA for 5-10k it would be a lot of work but you should be able to swap the current tube out for a different one
Tony
Amsterdam isnt a country 😂, nice vid tho
there is always a way around
Go buy josh larent car mat
15.06 dads name is Tony!
Get the guy who fixed tavarish’s mclaren to come and fix ur car!!!
dde ❤❤
get it sold!
Watched the p1 be re built now this!! Can’t think of anything better
Bro, they said Matt's dad's name like 💯 times in this video!  🤯😱😂😅
I’d go the Tavarish route and find someone who repairs carbon bike frames and see if they would take a go at it.
Why do you keep doing yourself this???
Take it back to the previous owner lol 😆
Would it have been less risky/cheaper to fly one of the techs out to Amsterdam to check out the car to see if it can be repaired? OTOH, if Mclaren won't repair it, I guess it just make this project more interesting!  😅
At least it’s not a water logged P1. Seems like you could get a carbon fiber repair kit and fix  the rocker panel section yourself?
Wait!! Is dads name Tony?
They couldnt tell that from the pictures?
YESSS A MCLAREN YESSSSSS
Tony🎉
At this rate Matts going to have alot of nice,but need some work on cars 💀
Time for tavarish to wrench on the other side of the pond😅😅😅
you ask DDE how they got parts
Junk it
Matt’s Dads name is Tony!
Geez I guess I’m going to have to start watching all of the ads so you can pay for all these.
Vtuned replace the tub with a used one, lots of work but worked out well. Get a used tub.
Expensive parts car... or a can petrol and some matches
that's trouble with this channel get into a repair and before its finished a new car
A simple video call to mclaren could of told you before buying what arse holes just to say no within seconds , maybe we should all go on trust pilot and leave reviews , anyways hope mat sorts it somehow , im sure he will
Ngl I’d be pissed at those specialist, bloke said no before you’d even moved anything to show the damage, the other bloke also knew the max amount of area they can repair so surely they’d have been able to see that from pictures
DDEFAM here 🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
Im sure its mentioned somewhere in the comments.... fly the Frame Dr. over
Big L for the camera man and BIGGER L for the editor.. how could you not censor the name of Dad?! 🤬
If anyone can find a way to get this McLaren rolling in a straight line again it will be you Matt Armstrong - McLaren Technician... I have faith in you even if you don't.
Send the tub to the guy Tavarish used.
Hope you can get the tub repaired, this will be an insane repair.
the mclaren rebuilds need to meet up when all is done. tavarish, dde & mat
Somewhere in Amsterdam there is a squirrel coming home with nuts in its mouth flabbergasted wondering where his home had gone lol
thats my absolute dream car
the lads need told off.... the amount of "Tony" thrown about.. hell i could have played the shot game... now everyone knows!
When ever you are done with this car I would love to buy it from you
Dope content 🇿🇦
Saying that Amsterdam is a country was enough for me to stop the video and unsubscribe and unfollow. You live 400 miles from Netherlands and you don’t even know the name of the country. It’s called Netherlands (like UK) or Holland (like England)
Fly it to America in a suitcase bit by bit and get Tavarish’s carbon wizard to fix it 😂
How's the Ferrari going? Is there going to be a bew video on it soon?
There's a 2020 720s tub on ebay matt.... 35k though, lol
Sorry to say but, that's 💯 an uneconomical repair because the resale value of it being a severely crash damaged vehicle 😞
Ma county 🫶🏻😂
Matt and tavarish should do a project together
Amsterdam is not a country bro, is the capital of Holland (name of the country).
Wow! Another impossible project which will turn to Gold soon.
You can fix it
can you just finish one car build before you start another, its so annoying when I'm looking forward to watching the Ferrari build and you have only uploaded that BS audi build and now this crap. STICK TO ONE PROJECT AT A TIME PLEASE
knowing you have the mega mind knowledge of Mike essa just a call away with the DDE guys and tavarish this build will be smooth sailing fingers crossed 🤞
'Dutch people tend to be trustworthy...' I dont know HOW we gained that honour but thanks I guess
720s rally wit dde 🎉🎉🎉
I think this project will pull thru! You got a great deal on the car… Your channel is successful for a reason, You gotta a good head on those shoulders!
Amsterdam is a country now. I did not know YouTubers could exert so much geopolitical pressure 😂
If the tubs damaged might as well throw it in the bin
Finally Mats dads name is Tony lol
THE PORSCHE FLASHING ON SCREEN IS CASH 😂😂
Your dads name is tony😃😂❤️
Where’s Liam? Not seen him on a video in a while
Don't give up Matt!!!!!   Make it happen!
What a great time to be alive @dde @tavarish and you all McLaren repair this is getting greater everyday can't wait for the repair videos
Great, finally some shinny new super car, will follow this!
The car has to have a full strip down, to get a proper look at the damage. Maybe look for another tub, even with light damage.
Just when i thought the 430 n the GT3 is as good a series that this channel can produce, u came up with this.... this is gonna be a good watch. thumbs up mat!
What's the price for a replacement Tub ?
Learn to fix it yourself , strip it to the point you can fix it
love these mclaren rebuild vids.  Both Tavarish and Vtuned did it.  You can too.  Cant wait to see more episodes!
16:54 😂😂
Ah. Amsterdam , the country xD
Fly Tavarish's guy out, and pay him to fix it.  You aren't done yet.  Don't throw the towel in.  Vtuned might have his spare tub still?  You still have options.
Goofy asf laugh, love the content though 😂
good luck, you gonna need every bit of it.
So it's Tony.
Win some lose some
Half the price, half a car...seems fair
Why 🤦‍♂️
Mate the color of the car should be a squirrel brown
Loved the video by the way 👌👌 nice 720 😂🤦🏻‍♂️ I know if you can get it repaired it’s going to be one awesome car 👍
its french not german 😂😂
Love the content!!!!!! I would say if possible try to buy a used carbon tube and transfer the part from the wrecked car to  the  used carbon tube and rebuilt car from there. I know mat and his team will find a answer !!!!!!
12:37 casually having a conversation with dde 🤣
Hey Matt, there a place down in West Sussex called Fontwell village where there is a place called GTR and they manufacture parts for F1 out of Carbon, they might be able to help repair or maybe remould it. Just a thought 👌👍
The famous country of amsterdam.
1:04 Today I learned Amsterdam is a country
I think the fix is to fly @tavarish and The Frame Doctor out there to get it fixed up! Great video! I'm excited to see the final outcome! The Audi RS6 is 🔥🔥 Keep up the great work!
Real carbon fiber needs to be handled with gloves. I dealt with it in the military, plus when carbon fiber is on fire make sure you are nowhere near it, it will cause lung problems.
part it out asap
If dde fix they 720 you’ll be able forza 🤙
Best of luck matt, its become crap. Not real anymore,Mr.Varish is a muppett as well . All the best
Love Dad & DDE ... I thought first call would have been to Tavarish
Dutch being honest when selling a car😂😂😂😂 dutch breakers being honestbig mistake. And yes i am dutch
holy fuckin shit boys
Huge undertaking! If anyone can fix it you and your team can . VTune in America replaced whole carbon tub on similar damage . Look forward to build series . Best luck !
I always buy my cars in the netherlands
That car looks way way to damaged
It was hard to press the like button on this, with that end... But hey, keep it up man
Did you just slip and not edit out you calling dad Tony? Lol
Thats not an easy fix.
Hello @Mat Armstrong I love your video am from Ghana. This rebuild make it like 720 gtr as DDE
6:29 GYATTT
tavarish and mat After fixing their McLaren, they are able to open a McLaren service center.
Give @vtuned a call, new tub ..
best of luck on this project mate
Got a feeling that you will spend a lot of time on the phone with dde
You probably gonna make more money from a single video showing people what it looks like to turn Mclaren into a cube
Dutch people tend to be trustworthy..... Max's photo pops up 😂😂😂
You'd make 60k parting that out so you're all good i think
Dam, what wrong with them all getting crashed
G E K O L O N I S E E R D 🇳🇱🇳🇱🇳🇱🇳🇱
Why did you even buy it? Love your content but that is mental, Mat
good luck mat with it, as you said their great cars, mclaren do like to tell you what you can do with your car, lots of money to maintain
Looks fine to me, lil bodywork, some phone calls to that fat guy Tavarish for some tips (btw the guy was NOT Dutch : ) )
your father is a GEM take good care of him !
The Dutch man done you like cornel  parker he gave you a snow ❄  job
@vtuned
1st
I knew this would hapoen,. Matt  i love ur channel  so dont take this the wrong way,  nobody in the uk or ireland gives a fuck about a Mclaren , as its not real to us. The M5 was an epic build but ur forgetting why we follow you.  Im sorry if people feel this is disrespectful but its the opposite of why we loved this guy.
Btw, the guys at yorkshire restoration are doing a fantastic job on your e24.......
think its a big gamble
Big oof Mat... wish you the best.
DDE collab a must
You was doing car's that most people could obtain so there was a big interest but most people can't obtain a car like that your losing your way fella and going down the goonsquad tarverish way there American numptys don't lose sight of what made your market it was the uk.
That's the bigest rebuild I've seen ever...mad lad is going hard core👌💪
mike from dde! yeahhhhh
Gonna be a big challenge but it will be exciting to see the build, good luck with everything Matt :)
The country we fly to... Amsterdam? England is my city type moment lol
Let the next build be a urus or G63
''The country we're flying to? Amsterdam!''  Mat did you momentarily turn into an American?
Lol Amsterdam ain't a country bro ... She's called the Netherlands 😂
Dad’s name is Tony! Finally we know lol
Look forward to see it done
try easy composites, they are in the UK, I am sure they would be able to point you in the right direction. big build but I am sure you can do it
Your dad is the best
This is gonna be a tough build brotha
Your dads called Tony, the secrets out😂😂😂
Omg pushing boundaries
your dads name is tony??
Those guys could have assesed the damage from the picture and told you no before you brought it, he said straight up they can only repair a small area which would have been easy to tell from a picture... wankers lol
Dutch squirrels don’t mess with wire harnesses 😜
All I can say is good luck with this one👌
Price so good are you getting  it free it's a absolute  lemon  🍋
There’s hope for the tub no doubt. Fly out the guy that fixed tavarish’s carbon?? Really want to see this one happen!
This might actually be a tough one… Can’t wait for the journey tho🫡… the final video finna start like “Just 6 months ago i bought the McLaren and it was an a absolute mess”
Go to the USA tavarish will show you someone to fix the carbon fiber
Lol @ max  The example of trustworthiness We know Dad's name!!
So the guy lied about the engine being started up and I’m sure he knew that couldn’t be repaired by the mclaren specialist and that’s why he sold it.
Hey Mat whatever happened to the Ferrari build?
Thought I'd just let you know that Amsterdam isn't a country 😂
5 minutes into the video looking at that and thinking "walk away". Without a doubt you are seriously talented but will this be worth the cost and headaches. Good luck whatever you choose 🤞
RIP to the squirrels who’s winter stash just got relocated
Oh Jaysus....whats next with Mat. A Holy Roller!!!
Ah yes, the country of Amsterdam
i only two ytbers that can fix this mess - freddy and matt
Well that's a flop just like the man's belly 20:31
McLaren could have looked at those pictures and said nah instead of wasting your time like that. Good luck with the build.
amsterdam... or 020... isn't a county ... sadly .... also XD dutch people aren't trustworthy at al ... yes we speak the truth most of the time ... until.... money.
Wait Matt was 2 minutes from my house? Damn 🤣🤣
Hope i am wrong but this feels like a parts car. Find a flood car is best advice i can give & with the hurricane hitting here in the states it wont be long before a few pop up. Might be able to avoid import dues if you strip an American car down to its tub and just ship that first anything else you need later.
Love hearing that laugh, even when told McLaren couldn’t fix it…
Build a roll cage around it.
Aaaah the country of Amsterdam
that is too wrecked
Bro is so smart! A genius business man, Half the price for a mclaren, spend quite a bit of money repairing it but make it back and then some by making a multiple part series once again 🔥💪
Clear your can fix it car vertical lol
720......I would of walked, now an LT and I would of seriously considered it
Walk away, walk away!!!!!!!!
Get tavarish guy over to the UK pay him feed him and let him loose at it
TONY!!!!
if you can't fix it, you can give it away to me ;) would be nice to have project car like that, to fix and drive around a property
“McLaren”  is the Welsh for “wide rocker panel”
I'm so excited to see the notifications for your videos! Having a shit day just bag on mat Armstrong video! ❤ Hope you get this back on the road what unreal car!
Your dads name is tony finally
I love you Mat, but Amsterdam isnt a country 😂
A lot of respect to matts dad
impossible to repair without losing money, the tub alone takes the build into negative equity
Hannah let it slip, Dads name Tony
Since when is Amsterdam a country Matt?? 😂  Looking forward to the project. ❤
Hi, I may have commented earlier, I am a stroke survivor.( lived!) since discovering your network, I get pep talk every day. There is plenty of stuff still to improve ( brain damage 😮) I look at what you are doing; it’s like a great dose of patience and optimism every day. Thanks, I appreciate it! I have this Audi, too old for the recall, any interest? ( I think my wife sold it, but, I am afraid to ask!) cheers!
Want something done right do it yourself
Can we get an update on the green lambo?
Airbags blown airbags blown, yet non are blown hmmmm
2 hour flight ... dam where did u fly from lol
Get Freddie/tavarishs guy out to repair it here
Matt! I don’t know if Tavarish could give you a hand since it’s a lefty drive?  I’m sure Tavarish will love to help you with this damaged 720!
@tavarish u r the man for this job😂
🔥🙏🙌
Batman’s stickers, that’s why they crashed it
Oh god Mat i havent finished yet but right off the hop it looks like tub damage. This might be a nightmare. You cant even sell the motor to Freddie!lol. Are you sure the dutch are trustworthy? Remember Dr. Evil is dutch!😅😂
You should work with DDE on this!
Wow - fantastic new project Matt!! You should be ok - especially with Tony the car whisperer onside 🤩
😮 that's a gutter hope you can pull it off this would be the best rebuild on YouTube good luck
Why does the taxi driver work for mclaren?
The Porsche flash talkin about the pyro fuse was hilarious I remember that nightmare LmL like wtf Porsche 🤬
Have tavarish's guy come to England and fix it
Use your engine and @tavarish 's carbon tub to make 1 mclaren!
Ouch! Oh I don't know....
Try drift builld guys . they build full carbon cars . Mayby can help you wiht tihis .  Have fun  .
Why did you pay so much for it
RACE!!!
Lol i think its dark raver his car 😂
Mate you need to put a breathalyser on your laptop good luck!!
You always say that you have made a mistake but you do fix it😂
Welp... We know Matt's Dad's name now. Another life mystery solved.
Amsterdam is a city not a country.
Get hold of the guy tavarish knows . . .ya mite have to spring for an air fare but hey . . Could be worth a punt . . .
Sooooo, Mat`s dad is Tony
Lmao amount off times they have said Tony’s name so everyone knows cause he was dirty no one knew his name haha I’d say more than 10 times this one video 😂😂😂
What I would be frustrated and a bit miffed about is the fact that they seemed to know instantly that the tub couldn’t be repaired. How can they know that from looking at it for a second but they couldn’t do that via a photo so you didn’t take such a risk? If they can tell that quickly, and it sounded like they had very strict guidelines on what they can and can’t do, then they would have been able to make that assessment from a photo.  That’s some stinky BS there!
Not the Porsche logo flashing 😭
That’s too far gone. I’ll be happy to be proven wrong though! (Tavarish’s carbon repair was much simpler, relatively speaking) and in a much less safety critical area too).
So… Tony is the name !
Looks like a new tub, @vtuned garage  had to replace it on him 720 it’s a big job but worth it
Wasn't expecting a cameo from Formula Drift Champ Micheal Essa 🏆😂
Terrible financial decision
What’s the outdo song that Matt uses called?
I’d want to take apart that engine anyways. As we’ve seen, they do like to explode
Amsterdam isn't a country 🙄
Time to learn how to repair carbon yourself I fguess? :D
And that country is ... Amsterdam 😂
Excited for this series!
I for see a trip to the State of Florida.
Seen this at Gravity! Good luck Matt thanks for the free shirt!
Matt, you need that 720 in your "bloodline"!
Shoutout to DDE. Truly the best in the business these days!
You were a kilometer from my house🥲😮‍💨😳
60k for a wreck, is a mistake…way to high. You obviously have the cash to do it, but you’ve painted yourself into a corner. You need to pull this off. It may kill you but you must succeed.
There wrong you can fix that tub I know what I’m talking about I’ve been working with carbon fiber for years on specialty sailboats
It’ll buff out…
Big gamble 😂😂 and look forward to seeing this build. At least you got £60,000 worth of spare parts just ask the USA guys
Let's go!
man you should've called him Mat's dad not tony
there's an Easter egg on this one😁Matt's dad name eheh
Mat is a good lad, fulfilling his potential, this 720s is sweet. Look at mr beast for example lol the dude is shredding lambos for fun
I don't know about this one Mat
You sent them pictures only to be told they had to see it in person. After delivering the car they instantly tell you they can only fix damage the size of a grapefruit! Obviously they didn't bother looking at the pictures! with that attitude and lack of professionalism, you're probably better off not dealing with them anyway. You should charge them for wasting your time and the transport costs 😊
Time to get Tavarish's guy to come across the pond and fix the tub.
Mat hope you kept the receipt
That’s some bs how are they going to say no instantly when seeing it in person but the pictures he sent were clear as day. Could’ve helped him save a shit tone of money instead of waisting his time. That pissed me off badly rn
Amsterdam is a Country aight
If we listen close, Matt’s dad is named Tony. Never forget.
Lol the mirror is the only thing he is concerned about.. haha
Target Composites
You gotta get in touch with @vtuned … he rebuilt one with a damaged tub
Well… At least it doesn’t have flood damage.
I love the community that you guys have built between yourselves @tavarish and DDE, all working together I love it ❤
so the dutch do lie
Send it to the US, they can fix it 😂
Talk to Freddie, he can't even get parts for his!
Maaan I’m not skipping ANY more ads to do my part to help pay for this build 🙌🏼💪🏼
I'd love to see you do a Jag, Land Rover, Rolls, G Wagon, Bentayga and Urus
I would buy a lotus and engine swap
I vote Matt Armstrong for the next top gear presenter
Could you not fly that guy out that fixed Tavarish's Mclaren and maybe he may be able to fix that?
My Duramax blows the doors off 720 and leaves them in a black cloud
PORSCHE 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣!!!!!
Mat has faced builds similar to this  720s like the Porsche Gt3 and the BMW M5 competition. Which all have major damage but the 720s is like on a whole nother level but Mat has what it takes to fix fully. Good luck in this build Mat and enjoy yourself in Sema!!!❤❤❤😎😎😎🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Those idiots could've told you before you bought the car and brought it across the country the maximum size they repair. Unbelievable. I would've ripped those guys a new one if it was my Youtube channel.
Been waiting for a McLaren for a long long time now! Killing it
Now Matt just buys a car in a front end crash and boom. Whole McLaren.
Surely you can't repair carbon fibre as the fibre strands a woven. You can't recreate that. The old TVRs were fibre glass and with random strand paterns so could be repaired. You will need a new tub and anything else carbon fibre replaced. Anything else is just a botch and wouldn't be safe to drive. Good luck with the build either way. You're brave taking that on.
It should be the mattclaren. Or MAclaren
I would be very surprised if this can be sorted well for less than a good one can be bought for but then again this is Matt and well let's see 👀
Show them it can be done. You are the warranty! Do it yourself!
What’s most funny is that car vertical didn’t show any accidents in history 😂
Correction!! Check car vertical even when dealing with the Dutch. Some of us are sneaky.
Matt just talk to mike Essa at DDE and you’re gonna know everything u need to know! Not to mention tarvarsh
Nobody should drive this anymore...
I think your gonna have to buy a donor tub😮
We try no matter !!
Maybe make sure the oil lines and radiators are all ok?
Watch VTuned garage he needed to replace the tub!
I thought drugs were bad i see supercars just as bad or more expensive.😂😂😂
You know Matt + Tavarish + Chris will find away of fixing this… in the very near future Matt will have a garage and all he will do is churn out super cars!!!
First class ticket for the frame doctor
Nederland ❤️
you must have money to burn or and endless bank acc 😂 what happen to the green lambo?? disapeared
Check out ben from vtuned, he fixed a 720s with tub swap included
“The country we’re flying to ? AMSTREDAM”  ly mat
If all they could get approval for, repairs wise, are tennis ball sized holes.... I am 100% sure they could have told you that same answer on the spot when you first called/emailed, after sending a quick picture, judging by how quick the guy glanced at it for a second and said no. this feels like one of those "this could have been an email" type situations.
Just watched you’re video and I used too work on the the 720s at a race event that you’re familiar with EMR 😂 too check the oil on the stick on the side of the steering column you have too click on too Service and you have too click on check oil level and the car has too be running with you’re foot on the brake pedal and you’re foot on the acceleration pedal for 40secs and it will show you a reading on the dash, you have probably found out by now but just though I would shoot you a comment over 😂, love the channel mate keep it up
Yeah not surprised the authorised McLaren repair centre wont fix it... Its kinda like asking an authorized apple repair centre to replace a capacitor. You'll find a frame doctor out there somewhere.
mate what have you done 😳😳 , ahhhhhh you'll be fine 🤣👍
Matt is the best and good things happen to good people and Matt will get this done 🇬🇧✌️
are you also planning to finish this one in 24hrs?
Can’t wait for the next episode.
It looks like a job for Jack🎉
You know it’s bad when Matt does that nervousness laugh 😂. Amazing car and at least u can ask around for help.
Neee tavarish, DDE, and Matt to make a collab video with their mclarens
Tavarish to the rescue
Sheesh
Wait did he just say your Dads name is Tony? I don’t think I’ve ever heard it in another video.
you never cease to impress n take it up a level well done to Mat n team another epic build coming 🎉❤
I like your ways. But stop this clickbait stuff. You don't need it.
Sorry but can we got back to “Matts Dad” please … this Tony business isn’t working for me!
Haha, that porsche logo when you said "they put it in loads of different places" 😂
Mike Essa to the rescue! Love that guy!
Buy the frame doctor a flight ticket and he come fix it in England for you haha
Amsterdam is a country? SMHL
That will be a very nice project can't wait for the videos 💕💕💕💕 🇳🇱🇳🇱
I’m hyped for this one 🫡
Speak to AGN composites, they do incredible repairs for motorsport teams with broken bodywork, never know they might be able to do something with it
ANYTHING is repairable. But when it costs more than new to fix it? Not just in parts, but in time. I wish you hadn't pay much for it. Your best hop is to find a car badly crashed in the front and get the parts for fix the rear and had a carbon repair specialist fix the body.
This should have been left where it sat, this was a horible purchase idea, its going to sink alot of cash.... but it does say one thing its still in better shape than what ever tavarish is trying to do, his p1 needed to just be scrap you dont mess with sea water
Flashing the Porsche logo....superb.
Car vertical shows that car had no accident 😂
Am I the only losing my mind over him putting his gloved greasy hands into his eyes.... 🤐16:40
Im surprised the airbags didn't go off
“Tony”, the name has come up!!
Can’t save em all bro unfortunately
To far gone ???? I think
Tony!!!
Strip it back to the tub and re-assess.
That "repair specialist" is full of crap. If he can't fix anything larger than a can it was obvious he was not gonna be approved to work on this. Could easily told this by looking at the pictures.  Nevertheless, it was obvious they would not want this repaired anyways, so i'm pretty sure Mat was just doing a little drama to make the video more interesting.  Best of luck mate, it's gonna look great when its done
You can repair pretty much anything made of carbon and epoxy. its just a matter of time and stripping back. The good thing is the tub won't be distorted because it's so stiff. Strip it bare, so you can see how far it goes.  you can do it yourself or I can put you in touch with guys in the UK that can help. Im in Australia btw, Mark D rough stuff carbon repairs,  email if you want long distance advice!! It will be a great addition to the scope of your channel, great stuff btw, love it!!
Who else saw it on msb’s channel before this video?
Tony!!!
poor Tonys name was leaked again :(
That's absolutely repairable. Get it to a boatbuilder.
take it back or start learning how to repair carbon parts  lol
Its YOUR Car But u need their "Permission to fix it??????????????? are U joking?
Yes you made a mistake? You keep a receipt? Return it lol
Hi Mat , looks this will be as bad as it gets , you’ve over come some big problems before I have all the confidence in you , good luck mate,   From the old  petrol head in Cornwall, Jan .
Mate your Loco 😂good luck with the Mac
Bit of Duct tape should fix your problem 😂
Plan B it is then 😳😳😳😳😳
Definitely a driver focused car only this time the driver was focused on driving in to wall 😢😂
Let the race begin. Tavarish Vs Matt Armstronk😉 Enjoy lads!
1:07 “the country we’re flying to: Amsterdam” ᶫᵒᶫ
Love this !!! Where’s the finished murcielago though !!
OBVIOUSLY.... bring over Tavarish's GUY!
lol carvertical "link in description" with the McLaren parked outside your unit. "Meanwhile, now we've got to decide if we're actually buying it" 😂 class editing Mat
I'd start by flying in Tavarish's link to repair the tub and go from there 😅
Now what then…Freddy?
I lost it when I read [Laughs in financial mistake]
Best of luck with the rebuild!   1:03 I don't think Amsterdam is a country 😂 😅
take the L
Great Video Mat...looking forward to following the story...have a feeling you may need a new 'tub'... safest and strongest repair.
Custom chassis. Its the only path forward now.
you crazy! good luck mat!
14:09 😂
That's a parts car now...
Yipee I'm meny meny thousands today, well done
His dads name is Tony??
You should look at more videos of dde! Mike really explains everything amazingly good, maybe even get his number to ask questions. Love the vids keep up the good work!
“A life without risk is no life at all “ repair the carbon yourself ! Kits on eBay ….  😂
tonyyyy, the man the legend!!!
@mclaren please donate a tub for this build, even if you have to sell it to Mat at a VERY discounted rate😂
Part it out and try and get your money back!
One day I'll own a mclaren. Hopefully in better condition but one day.
U r nuts
How many views do you think you'd get if you just set fire to it?
This rebuild is gonna be crazy 🤯
he couldnt have told you on the phone i cant fix something bigger then a tennis ball? lolllll
So far anyone who didnt know the name of Mat's dad before..... now you know
here a fan from holland good luck with the rebuild 🔥🙏🏻👨‍🔧
Amsterdam isn’t a country m8
Blimey!
We know the name of the legend!  His dad’s name is…Tony! 😜
Dad’s name is Tony! Cheers!🎉
DDE ARE SCAMMERS !!!!!!!!
Just trust in yourself, and it will be done. Going to be long or short series still looking forward to it. 👍👍👍👍👍
Looking forward for the McLaren rebuild 😊... I trust team Armstrong will pull this one💪
Walk away Mat, walk away!  BTW your videos are killing it everytime you post.
Good god, that looks absolutely bollocked 😮 Matt you're insane in the brain, absolutely love it!
👮🏼 🐿 I popped down the oak for a few nuts come back and some bastards nicked mi house officer……
i’m sorry but amsterdam isn’t a country 😂
Soo it’s Matt’s dad’s name is Tony?
Good luck Matt I'm sure you can do it your brilliant!
Good luck 🤞🏼 I think you will need it 👍🏻
Fly that dude in from America asap..
Gosh! What another adventure.
You got it half priced if a used one because it is only half of a used one
Checkout v-tuned’s McLaren build for inspiration 👍
Would it be copyright if your next t shirts/merch for this project said MatClaren on them 😂 i think its funny but cool at the same time
If it was so obvious, surely some pictures would have done the job 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Time to fly in tavarish's carbon tub guy
There’s me worried about my £2500 Honda CRX that’s a bit rusty 🤣🙈
The frame Dr is the man to ask . There will be someone in the UK as good if not better than the frame Dr surely.
Thought I heard Mat's dad's name is Tony ?
Ah yes the country of Amsterdam 😂. Sick car Mat can't wait for the build
TONY!!!
Look up to vtuned man. He replaced the whole 720s tub on his channel.
I wouldn't pay anymore then 40k for that
GUYS. IT'S OFFICIAL. MAT'S DAD'S NAME IS TONY!!!!!!!!!!! 11:05
OMG, he mentioned your dads name, twice 😂
is this going to be his first parts car because of the damage
Matt your going to have to buy the Frame doctor a fright to the U.K and food while your at it. Bay this Mc Runnig!!!!
Ah yes Country of amsterdam
can't wait to see the next lambo part
Yeah no but it looks like that dashboard is in French
Mooi ouwe! Nederlanders en Engels Hahahaahahhahhah
Love the wee Porche dig 🤣
I would think that carbon damage to that extent would be in the 10s of thousands to repair, not a mere 5k. I have a sneaking suspicion that the gearbox/transaxle is bad as well due to the amount of force that was applied onto that rear axle. My guess is a £50k total repair cost at the end of this series. Good luck Matt!
Definitely gonna regret buying this
MAT, do you try to find the worse challenge ????? You get it . Nobody can repair a broken chassi in carbon fiber . I am afraid that you will have to bought a brand new chassi . Or you try to sell the engine, the seats, etc  and you forget this nightmare . I cannot imagine the price of the spare parts from Mc LAREN . I said that because i appreciate your all team . I don't want that you loose time and money . I don't understand how they can authorize to sell car with this kind of damages .
Freddy and Ben (vTuned) thinking this guy is fcked 😂😂😂
Mat’s Dads name reveal out of no where be like
Finally we know the "DAD'' is Tony :D
Whats the capital of Amsterdam?😆
i’m dutch😂
I’m sure it’s fixable, but is it financially viable 🤷‍♂️
The country were flying to….Amsterdam 😳
Amsterdam’s a country now? Looking forward to the new project!
This could be a bridge too far
Buy a new carbon tub, £35k
🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷
You and Tavarish are gluttons for punishment lol 😢
Isit still top secret matts dads called tony? Wish i had a £ for every time he got name dropped in this episode😂
this one is going to be challenging
The country Amsterdam? 😢
Mat's Dad's name is Tony, if anyone asks again.
For the Americans here, Amsterdam is not a country
Ooh you said his dad's name? Or did he?
Good look DDE had a hard time fix there crashed 720s
Hi Matt, VTuned in USA rebuilt a Mclaren 720s, he replaced the tub, good luck.
How much is a used carbon tub? 🤔
Mr Tony loading the car🎉
That carbon tub repair is gonna be hard with it being on the sill as that an area where the tub is usually the stiffest and strongest to protect the driver and to provide the needed torsion stiffness a car of that performance needs.  Gonna have to cut out and sand back all the damaged carbon (which is going to messy and itchy if you dont wear proper PPE), mold the sill, create a new carbon skin off that mold matching what the original tub had in terms of layup, and then bond it back to the tub with probably some overlap to ensure it still is strong and stiff enough.  It's not gonna match what McLaren originally did since they use a RTM process for making their carbon tubs but you can surely make it work. Tavarish luckily had damage on a flat section which made it cake walk with respect to a sill being damaged.
We finally know Matt’s Dads name!
I have a feeling there’s going to be another damaged Mclaren that will be needed to donate the parts needed, or maybe this car was always the donor car for the other one that is yet to be unveiled? I wouldn’t be surprised if this turns out to be another build that Tavarish is involved in that may be of mutual benefit to his build.
What couldn’t the UK repair guys have made that assessment from a photo ?  It only took them one glance to say no.
Pacific Motors have a second hand tub for less than $5k
If you still don't know Mat's Dads name after this video - shame on you.
Is the Ferrari build still going on?
Take it to the US
Wait until you need a special McLaren tool in order to represurise the suspension. 😂 60,000 plus the amount it's gonna take to fix it is gonna be way more than the 130,000 it cost to buy a good one.
What the f..k are you doing Mat??? you copying  Tavarish?  c'mon mate, it's like you are loosing what you are good at.  Be you!!!
At least we now know Matts dad's name !! 😅😂
Find a breaker and do a RHD conversion!!!👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🤞🤞🤞🤞 show us what’s involved on a car like this
You just opened a big can of Worms good luck putting this one together
Now we know your dads name
the country? Amsterdam
Country Amsterdam 😂
Damn man, its hard enough to fix a McLaren with no accident history... good luck with this one buddy lol
Put the engine into something else!
Tony, Tony, Tony
Since when is Amsterdam a country?😬😂
Tony can fix it. Yes he can!
Wow! Curious to see how you're gonna pull this one off Matt! I'm sure you've got something up your sleeve but this has to be the biggest challenge you've ever faced on this channel.. can't wait to see how this is gonna turn out! Good Luck!!
🤞🏻
Honestly mate, I love the Dutch, but I would never buy a car from them.
Maaaaaaaat, you have got away wiv it for too looooong. I think this is the one which stings you. You havent even striped it down yet ffs.  But goidluck I'm looking forward to it. 😊
New tub it is then???
McLaren dealer  “we’ll need to see the car in person to make and assessment on the repair”  £60k later and 30 seconds after seeing it  “Nah”
Did anyone else notice they let Matt’s dad name slip!
I wouldn't trust them to touch it!
When you dropping Ferrari part 4?
Jamming 🍁
The Country we are flying to? Amsterdam. muhahaha xD
Just ship tavarish’s mate over 😂😂
Mat, you and your team can do this - how do I know?  That cheeky grin at the end.  😅😂
You’d think the specialist repair place could’ve just told them no after seeing a photo rather than waste all that time transporting the car to them. It was literally instant
mat if no one in uk can fix it maybe u need to bring travrish  carbon fibre specialist over
I wish we were aloud to fix stuff like this In Australia 🇦🇺 unfortunately we are not as written off cars get crushed , God bless from Newcastle Australia 🇦🇺
I BELIVE IN YOU MAT. You’ll beable to sort that in no time 🎉
Good luck Mat.. biggest challenge to date.. isn’t it👍
Fly the frame doctor out to the UK
🤞🏻for you
Wow you actually called DDE for advice
Isn’t there a problem with it having mot issues in the UK?
Put the running gear in something else and really piss mclaren off😂😂😂
Matt is becoming a beast 🥰🥰🥰 Can wait to see how this thing run
is this the first video we hear Mat's dad's name?
You are absolutely mental but i hope to see this repaired. Good luck mate can you switch it you right hand drive?
Why couldn't they tell you the size of the repair they are allowed to do after sending them pics 😶
Finally the name of your dad! Tony!
Ha, sent them a pic of the damage and they said they needed to see it to assess it. Looked at it for one second and said no.
The car and everything else won’t be as big a challenge as going to the country Amsterdam 😂👀 1:00
Amsterdam is not a country U know.
This video alone will easily reach 1M views. That's at least 5k USD earning on it. Considering the popularity of the content that can easily reach 2M views (more than subscribers) and earn 15k. So with 5 videos like that irrespective of what happens with the car, it's been paid off ;). In my book, that's virtually zero risk involved and potential big earning.
Was that a max verstappen pop up 🤣
I reckon some T-Cut and that’ll all polish out
its amazing how you guys keep a good laugh and sense of humor going . support from nyc .
Think those Dutch boys might have been telling porkies about it starting and going into all the gears!!!
What's the price on a new tub
Ouch, this dream car is gonna be a nightmare... Good luck guys, may the force (and the torque) be with you...
you're smart enough to know Amsterdam isn't a country mat
@20:59 did he just say tony? Matt’s dads name is fucking tony? I been waiting a long while to find this out 😂
Hang on, Mat's Dad's name is Tony? Did we know that before?
ECPS Group in Poland Can fix carbonfiber monocoque .
Think you you dad's right on this 1 take it back 😅😅😅😅 can't wait to see how this one comes out.
“We drive it tonight”
You're dad's name is Tony???
That carbon repair looked like a huge bodge! You can never get that continuous fiber strength back. Will always be a patchwork job. And trust the Dutch? You learned the hard way 😂
I guess rebuilt of wrecked McLaren's is a trend nowadays! 😅😂
Fly the Yank in........he'll get it sorted. Get him booked in the holiday inn with breakfast thrown in.....it'll be sound.
Love the car bro
Hi Mat - Fly Tavarish  carbon repair specialist over get him to repair it - 🤔🤔👍👍Job done
Ah, the Yorkshire Boys will fab a panel for that.dont mind them.😂😂🤣.if there's the will, thers the way.or a relative.👍
YouTube gonna pay for it baby
i was just at amsterdamn and flew through bristol same plane and everything damn probably just missed you XD
I don't understand why youtubers try to start engines in a crash without even knowing if there is oil in the engine. If it is still good, you can destroy it.
Check v tune he swaped slmost whole car
Man killed it with 44k likes in 4hrs wow
Is the glass OK in the mirror? Lol that's the least of your worries 🙃
Good luck matt it shall work out
At least we now know Matt’s dads name! 😂
Mat is trying to one up dde lol
The country: Amsterdam
if it ain't Dutch, you can't trust
The Dutch, trustworthy 😂 If they didn't rip you off, they forgot!
When I first saw the Aston Martin video, I thought Matt had issues, but at this point I don't even know what to say😂
Goldmember wasn’t trustworthy although he was Freaky Deaky…
Check with V Tuned, He rebuilt his also.
vTuned Garage on here bought a 720s with tub damage and swapped everything over to another tub. Might be worth reaching out to him if you get stuck with anything
Yes Mat! These companies won't touch it, you got to find someone clever like you who understands carbon fibre 🤘🤘
You are CRAZY 😂😂
Dream car for sure
Mat we all knew you would buy it whatever the condition 😂 good luck my man looking forward to more fun content 👍
I saw the car in Gent at van der Valk hotel. 😂😂😂 I made some picture of the car. Good luck and hope you can fix it.
You can do it
"The dash is in GEEERMAAAN" - "Bonjouuuuur, c'est la vie à Paris! Baguette?" :D Geile Nummer. :D
My mrs would say that’s a 5minute job
V tuned did a tub swap on his mclaren rebuild and no doubt will impart good advice to you…….imho the car isnt worth half its value given the costs you will be facing
Just Fly the Tavarish guy to UK and let him fix it :) easy
Gekoloniseerd
8:20 "Tony" !!!!
😳
this is going to be a way bigger project than you bargined for🙏🏻good luck
No one noticed Anna call mats dad TONY 😂😂😂
Ah a McLaren.  Looks horrible, but Tavarish is rubbing off on you lol.  Going to be a good series.
Matt your dad's name has come out 😂 Hello Tony 👋
It'll be fine... Send some pics to the carbon guy from Tavarish... Fly him over , give him a few pints and some meat pies (and maybe a few dollars) and let him fix the tub.  Tavarish know some people for parts.... What could possiblly go wrong.....
Love the your optimism and smile on the face!!! this is how you have to live!
this car is a big mistake, strip it and then bury it
I think it’s awesome you’re keeping the connection going with DDE.
Amsterdam isn't a country, mat
the country we're flying to? Amsterdam      love the vid <3
You'll find a way Matt, you always do.
It's nice that you have a new project, but why did you buy that car? Have you looked on the internet, there are more negative things than positives regarding the appearance of the car itself, that car will never leave the same look at the first look, what a car 😢
Well, time to buy an UK spec carbon tub and swapp everything over like vTuned did with his 720!
If this wasn't £500 why would you even bother? I know this is the point of his channel but fml thats beyond wrecked!
I would be looking towards the aerospace industry to get that fixed. Much more experience with carbon than in the motor trade.
So they could tell you if they could repair it by looking at pictures, but almost instantly told you no within 2 mins of looking at it. I have to say that seems less than helpful 😂
It's Worth ? I think no 😅
Is this a new drinking game drink everytime 'TONY' is said?
Newsflash Mat... Amsterdam is NOT a country 👍
Is a cockpit 720 for sale on ebay 5k
Lol why?
Black market technician will do it, just don't tell McLaren
M8, that's a tough one... surely if a mclaren approved repair centre who have to say yes,  said no,  then what can you possibly do... ?..looking forward to seeing this one!!
Get in touch with race car manufacturers or possibly even aerospace companies. Might be able safely to fix that…?
Think that’s too far gone.  Hell of a job to sort that one
and the country we're flying to:  AMSTERDAM! 😂
What a POS company. They couldnt say "send us a few pictures", instead of making yall buy/bring the car in. Id start a boycott.
Mats dad’s called Tony 😮
The F1 is the only McClaren
I see a 720S EVO on the horizon,like Tavarish and the P1!
Why does it always gotta be a LOSE THE SHOP SITUATION with this Channel? I mean you don’t need the Fake Drama!!!
Not sure even if repaired it wont be as safe in case you crash as original. I wouldnt buy it even if repaired professionaly. But you are not professional.
Damn
You positivity in the face of adversity is something everyone needs a slice of, how you remain so in control is the reason I watch these.   I have absolutely no doubt in my mind that you will complete this , but I can’t wait to journey with you Hannah big Tony and the chaps
Wheres the Merci at?
Should have walked away from that one,and they said they had it running,ah don't think so.Good video though mat.
Show DDE how to rebuild a 720s
Wood and glue...great track car😆
Should have walked away after seeing the damage. Not Mat! 😂
You've never given up so you'll do it. Perhaps a second hand tub? You never know. Its the equivalent of re-shelling a car can be done.. 👍
I’m thinking the tub can be repaired don’t just stop at one technician telling you you can’t fix it tavarish just luckily had a guy who undoubtedly does great carbon work maybe it would be best to fly him out get him materials to repair that tub unless it’s economically not feasible getting a new tub is very very pricey
“The country we’re flying to…. AMSTERDAM”😂😂😂😂
Amsterdam is a country now
“I think I made a big mistake” said every time before he restores it fully 😂😂
From the tt to this ❤
That guy from McLaren said no the minute he saw the damage to the tub.....he could've seen a photo and said no
Nobody other than a YT creator who can monetise the carnage is touching this heap of crap with a 10-foot pole.
It's a NO, from me....
I’d be pissed with McLaren. They could of told you that with pictures and didn’t need to see it in person if they can only repair a tennis ball size. 🤞🏻 you find a solution.
Not trying to be disrespectful but the camera man chats so much shit 🤣
They definitely could have determined that from the photos.
Least we know the mystery’s persons name 😂😂Tony happy to put a name to the face now 👌🏻👌🏻👍🏻
This video will boost your Channel.
Absolutely buzzin’ that you ring DDE for advice. It’s awesome the collaboration that’s going downs
Speak to Ben VTuned. He rebuilt his one from tub to finish. Got many of his parts from the uk.
Either going to be a loss, win or education so can't go wrong 🤞
Enough breakers in the UK. Source a tub there and manage to actually start the engine before you invest in it. In The Netherlands there is a tub for sale for 8k pounds (10k euros) but its RHD. Hopefully you manage to find one cheap.
Get it Mat
8:19 Haha now we know….. Tony 👍🏼😂
It's a shame that you're dad's name was mentioned 6 times during video. That's another little secret gone !!!!!  Good luck with the car.
Just slap some duct tape on it, it be reight 🤣
Amsterdam is indeed a country
You got this Mat! We believe you can pull this off. Best of luck
Amsterdam is not a country…
Well Tarvaris can go help you with his people,worst case,you got this
Weird that the guy told u they tested the engine and gearbox at the Mclaren dealer even though the gearbox leaking oil? Other than that good luck and u might have to call the Carbondoctor from the USA to fix that tub for you😢
I saw this car in the Netherlands on the side of the road when it first came in at that company. I hope you are able to fix it, I wish you guys the best of luck. I am for sure going to follow this journey!
This is not the end.....
How about some carbon body work ... Maybe a full 765LT body in forged?  We can make it happen.
You cant go wrong with Dutch imports!
Fly the carbon repair guy that tavarish uses out to the uk and let him fix it for you.
Ah yes! The country Amsterdam, such a wonderful country!
That’s awesome you talking with DDE And Mike E.  It’s so cool to see all you guys help each other out when it’s needed!!! Can’t wait to see this one built!!! You got this Matt!!! Just Gotta “Wrench Every Day” As your Mate would say! 😂
Mat there is a video idea for you get an Audi A5 mod it until it is a beast found one for you No. Plate  EJ12ZYZ
Love your content Matt and enjoy every one of your videos, but......... I feel that you have a donor vehicle all set up to transplant all of the good parts over. I hope that it is not scripted, but we will see. Cheers from Guam USA👍
now we know your dad's name 😜 15:03
Somehow I think you’ll get the repair done. Can’t wait for more videos on this build.
I know a friend who could remove all the bumps and dents on the McLaren with just PDR... let me know if you're interested and I'll give you his number! 😁👌🏻
Got to admire your balls Mat! 🤣
Parts car, you got another one incoming that is less damaged.....or this is going to Florida. Go for it Matt!
I guess the DDE BOIS! and TAVARISH be going to UK I like this BUILD!
That’ll buff out
Mat.....by now you should have that pyro-fuse in stock...like 20 of them.
😭🔥 Looking forward to this one
Have to fly out @vtuned YouTube most like has parts possibly too
That’s a project and a half
nice
Msb leaked it!
Holy bejezus Mat. This will be a huge undertaking if you get it done but I genuinely think this build will break you. Send it back lol
I'm certainly sure you can do this. Cmon give it a shot 🔥🔥🤝🏾🤝🏾
This is gona be epic 🔥  All the best Matt gona be a banger of a build
replacement TUB is the only option
Mat, theres a Race team in Tamworth that race Mclarens, might be worth asking them about parts etc, there called Paddock Motorsport :)
I think you can make more money breaking it
Ah yes, the well known country of Amsterdam :D
and i was hoping so much that he hadnt given more than 40.000.. it just doesnt worth the pain for 60k
Your dads called Tony?
The dash was reading in French not German 😂
8:18 “tony” dads name has finally been released
I guess find another someday with a smashed front end and make a racing car, go racing...
Oops
His dad's name is Tony, finally found out 😁
You’re dad’s name is Tony!
Loving your work.
TONY!
Matt u can fix it don’t let a bit of carbon put u off 👍
The lads at DDE Daily Driven Exotics have been having issues trying to fix their Mclaren, especially with the charged suspension which only a Mclaren technician can do, tho they did manage to find an ex Mclaren technician with the tools needed.
Tavarish , DDE.. what’s next 😅❤  can’t wait to see this rebuild ❤❤
Wait what. Mat was in the Netherlands?
I’m sure man like Tavarish will be able to help you with this 😎
Looks like another victim of max Verstappens driving
You're insane!!! And I'm here for it. Hope it goes your way!
Is this the first time we hear Mat's dad's name?? Tony?? Couple videos ago it was still a secret... 😂🤣🤪
Netherlands🇳🇱🇳🇱🇳🇱🇳🇱🇳🇱
these projects keep getting crazier
We're going to be in for a ride with this one. :) GL Mat!
A quality composite shop should be able to fix it.  Just fly Freddy's guy out, that won't be in your 5k budget though.
love your dads humor!!!
Its not a risk if the price is low enough to break the car to recoup the investment
Here we go as soon as Matt says l think it's a big mistake, I'm all in, this could get interesting. In regards to the carbon repair when the specialists say no there will be a one man band around who will say l'll give it a go just need to find them
You got this fella👍
Who's Tony 😅
Love yah matt, not a huge mclaren fan but im sure what you do with it will change my mind 💪
Everything is possible mat just got to learn as you go along and gain more experience. This one just like a walk in the park for you mat 💪🏼
They could have made that assessment from pictures.
Ma, you never disappointed, never
V-Tune on Youtube was able to find a tube for his damaged Meclaren..
Your dad's names Tony do I win a t-shirt? 😂
Ah yeah Amsterdam, what a lovely Country 😂
the country, Amsterdam? :D
Definitely need Freddy over there with u with the guy who repaired his McLaren bring him to ur the uk
I know nothing about cars (this comment could be all the proof needed!) but, are engine swaps a possibility with modern cars? All I'm thinking is if you find a car with a good or repairable engine but knackered body etc, and another car with a good body/frame etc , could you make one Frankenstein car out of the two?
20 minutes just isn’t enough 😢😅
Send it to Freddies mate in the USA
Broccoli
Yeah na the engine is fine👍🏾 McLaren started it up themselves, they checked the transmission whilst it was running...  you can call them if you like😂😂😂😂     yeah I would've played his Bluff and phoned McLaren right there in front of him!!
I’m sure you  will make the right decision MATT you have never failed yet there must be people who can fix carbon properly no matter what MC LAREN say
Matt can fix it!🎉🎉!! Yes!
Get the Yorkshire boys to make one out of aluminium lol
Absolutely nuts man but you'll find a way
Is it just me that heard mats dads name? i wont spoil it but thought other also recognized it but no
They couldn´t tell the size of that hole on the photo??
Get a different tube just fix the damage then change the tube every can be fixed
"the country we're flying to? Amsterdam..."  noooooo 😂 Matt, what have you done.
How much to fly freddys mate to yours or fly car to usa
Freddy probably has a spare 720S tub kicking about in his unit…. Next vid…. Flying my McLaren to Florida to see Freddy’s carbon fibre magician! Epic build. You keep raising the bar. Awesome.
Metal yes,  carbon fibre no.... That's a paper weight Matt, love the videos though peace
Put the running gear in something else, flex your skills in making something incredible, everyone will support and help you 👍🏼
Same as the Ferrari 430, he paid far too much for it!  It is not even RHD, so he will have the aggro of having to sell it abroad. The Maclaren is a breaker!
strip it and sell the parts.
USA give away????
Time and money can fix most anything mechanical!
CBT in Moria repaired my carbon frame bike so it’s definitely possible.
Matt you best start watching YouTube videos on carbon repair 👍🏼
Hi Mat,  I really enjoy your videos and your channel. Your attitude, genuineness and positivity is valuable, and it's something I come for when launching your videos. Regarding Mclaren I do not agree with the idea of rebuilding something that Manufacturer denied doing. They have their reasons which is safety. They make these cars with crazy precision to master on tracks and roads. Of course everything could be fixed, but alternative methods of repair are not giving guarantee, that is needed for safety of future owners (maybe even ones that are not aware about the incident). In that case I am not supportive towards the idea of repairing something that is not repairable in the eye of people who built it - simply because it might be dangerous to the driver. Cheers, Piotr
McLaren the Great New Zealand founded company Bruce Mcclaren hence the kiwi bird logo.
i heard a name!!!
So basically you bought half a 720S for half the price of a whole used one ? 🤔
The motor is fine it didn’t turn all the way over so it fine
F Mclaren and F that shop that needs permission to work on the car.
That shop you took your car in Birmingham and that fat man always said no. He just looking for easy work.  They are rubbish.  I took my car to raw one ltd Birmingham bodyshop who is willing to repair anything.
You should of halved the 60k, good luck
I have a wonderful gearbox that needs fixing on my civic type r if you ever want an easier project hahaa !! Definitely a big job this one ! But can't wait to see the finished product!
This is a fix for views car no way this is viable.send it in a container to Freddy
Since when Amsterdam is a country? 😂 Few shelfs of filler and it will buff out nicely! Lol
The main thing from this video is matt’s dad has a name Tony 😂
What a task! Amazing thought processes and confidence. Can't wait to see the progress!
Probably only need an approved repairer if you’re going to sell it in this country. If you’ve seen Gasmonkeys F40 repair in America the rules are different… and it’s left hand drive.
One of my all time favourite cars, the 720S. I **REALLY** hope you do this build somehow. It would be epic to see you get this on the road.
🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡
Love how the camera person dropped dads name after soooooooo many episodes with out 😂
Tony!!!!!!
well another 1  for spares when will u finish lambo & ferrari at least u can post monthly like tavarish now
Guess you're learning how to repair carbon dude !!😆✌
This would be a massive project but I'm all here for it 😍
“Dutch people do tend to be trustworthy” famous last word’s especially when showing max 😂
Fumbling through as always
mate you paid about 25000 too much for the car....
Loved that little subtle joke about the pyro fuse and the Porsche emblem in the top right hand corner at 14:09 Great new series to come!
That looks very bad, but I would be right up for the challenge. I’m definitely looking forward to the challenges … I can feel a solution to this first big issue coming .. from where 🤔 That’s why I’m watching 👍
i have faith he’ll fix this and make it at least a show car and keep it off the track
MAX’S DADS NAME IS TONY
Go to a cycling carbon specialist they can fix anything it’s just a matter of money
A barrow full of filler, bit of super glue it will be as good as new , the weight might increase by 400% but hey ho 😂
All I was thinking throughout the video was that you need to strip it and part it out.
There is definitely someone out there who can repair it, don’t give up, I’ve seen Lamborghini with carbon roofs repaired with worse damage.
Walk away surely
The country of Amsterdam…aged.
At least we now know mat's Dad's name!
I'm excited to see how you get on with your biggest challenge yet... 🙏🏿👍🏿🙌🏿 you've got some big balls man 😂
How long until pyro fuses are no longer by passable?😂
I’ve touched that turbo
You may just want to part it out.
I have a feeling this will be your absolute favourite when it’s finished. Never heard a bad thing about the 720s. PS - any chance of some coil-overs for my e46? 😙😂
Good luck Mat.  You can do it......although my first thought when I saw the title thumbnail was, "SOO CHEAP......BUT SOO FOOKED!!!" 😱😫
As ever got us all hooked with the first video!!! HWBT!!!
Idiotic purchase
Tavarish will guide you
🤘😎🤘🚗💨
Can they rebuild it quicker than DDE’s 720 GTR. That’s the real question
I want more! Looks bad, can’t wait to find out what you decide to do about it. Good episode
Love the bit u calling DDE
Mclaren will be fixing it once they realise its for this channel, be great publicity for them let's be real!
I’m so excited for this build
Trusty those Dutch....
WALK AWAY NOW !!!!
I know you like a challenge Mat, but that's a challange and a half mate. But if anybody can do it you can buddy 💯👍
How about a water-damaged unit in the US and butchering them together.
That can be repaired, its gonna take a lot of work but 100% repairable... Just make sure the tub is not bent (take of every weight from the back), and whip out the epoxy and the carbon sheets...
No. Not a hope. That’s beyond the pale. Waste of money.
Vtuned changed the complete tub. What a build was that!
Looking forward to this one Mat, best of luck you’re gonna need it😉🤣
I Have a 720s and looking forward to this build...
What has happened with the ferrari
I know you will sort it matt.
Omg 😂
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Omgggg yesssss I’ve been wanting a McLaren vid
Last I checked Amsterdam isn't a country 😏, Great content Matt keep it up
If you get this fixed, then, we’ll I don’t know what to say, I really hope you do man, incredible car.
Didn’t Vtune swap out the whole tub on his rebuild?
Once Justin Bieber said NEVER SAY NEVER ….
Talk to an aerospace guy or an aircraft composite repair tech. Preferably airframe certified. It’s a vacuum bag repair guarnteed😊
"The country we're flying to... is Amsterdam" :D
Did v tuned not billed 1 off them he got a new shell
I love how your dad just isn't fazed by anything 😂
Good luck Mat, I hope you the best ! Give us some show hehe!
Proper excited for this
The wonderful country of Amsterdam indeed
Put the motor In something
I wish you best of luck, it looks very badly damaged, so I really cheer for you to get it together by using some magic and miracles.  I woulldn't want to sound picky, but here's what you said: "the country we're flying to: Amsterdam" ouch geography: failed. Sorry
Fly in the carbon wizard!
Nah mate, Mat’s got a plan. He always does
If they were that quick to say no to the repair then they could have concluded that from the photo's, what an assholes.
You have to be on it to win it… travarish is your man.. I have faith in you Matt..
Oh dear 😂
its funny how he states it only cost £60k to buy yet the flight, recovery on top and now, that McClaren is going to worth £120k after youve put £60k into it to fix as they aint cheap. have you learned nothing from Tavarish a P1 battery is $170k
If anyone can fix it its you buddy cant wait to see the finished product
Quick mat, there a tub for sale on the bay. 30k
Can’t believe these are only c. 130k
Get the guys To do it for teaching purposes on their own time in your workshop
Mat fly over the guy that repaired Tavarish Mclaren to do it......
New tub seems like it
You can buy a new one for 100 000$ 720 😂😂
Nightmares of the Porsche piro-fuse still linger in the minds of many.
I mean, you CAN confuse French with German... but you really shouldn´t 🤣
You are class  you should be on sky
Get @vtuned involved
The engine starting up and turning off will be the ECU fires the engine on a base map, then it reverts to looking at the air mass, as you have hoses off/broken i should imagine its not seeing air mass.
Looking forward to seeing you figure out a fix.  And your Dad is awesome.  You are too.  We see where that came from.  Loving your videos.
here again starting again
WOW 😳 🤔🤔  this going to be a very very good build. This is a  make or brake challenge but YOU ARE MATT THE STRONG ONE💪🏿 you have this. Only one thing I would say those people take the piss they could have tell you that over the phone simple if the damage is over x size they can't touch it 🤦🏾‍♂️
another car restoration, im here for it
I want to cry soo badly if i knew that you where there i drove straight to you and try to get a picture because i live like half a hour from Amsterdam😢 your the best youtuber that exists keep the vids going your the best👌👌👌👌
They r far to expensive to repair
2hr flight? Where are you flying from haha
everyone has broken  720s's 🤣
It looked so bad. I am not surprised
„The country we‘re flying to… Amsterdam“ 🤓🤨
I'm no expert and this might not be practical but can't you fly the guy over from the States that mended Tavarish's Carbon? I would havs thought you could source the raw materials but arguably not his skill.  Just depends on your build budget and what margin you want to make if you're selling it.... Although would be a magnificent edition to your enviable collection of prestige cars.
TONY?!?!?
TONY
Who dares wins Rodney, remember two things ?one it’s not fibre glass and two your need plenty of glue ! Looking forward to seeing the finish product . Good  luck Matty boy,,
Matt how are you? I work at McLaren MSO and know my way around the 720s very well.. let me know if you need any advice or support I’m happy to point you in the right direction 👍
You should watch the videos of Damon and Dave at DDE trying to repair their 720 GTR as that took a hit on the rear right side
And the country we’re flying to? Amsterdam.  Brilliant.
Love the way you guys keep your spirits up despite all the setbacks, it's inspiring. Your Dad is a top guy! Best of luck boys. You got this!
Go on mat!!!! Were all really proud of u and how u have achieved ur dreams, keep up the brilliant work m8 😊🎉
Matt Watson ❤️❤️❤️
You know Matt already has a plan in his back pocket... 👀
F!y the bloke from the state's Tavarish used .
Written on the wall in a Thai hostel was “never trust the Dutch”  Let’s hope they were wrong
Yeesh.  Start taking everything apart and see what else is wrong in there.  In any case I guess you'll need everything apart to either replace the tub or part out the car.  Might have to do the Freddy special and find the UK frame doctor.
give dde so tips if u finish b4 them😂
Let me know if youre in the netherlands again, id love to meet you
Together with Tavarish from two they will do one.
Bro said dashboard is in German haha, it was in French lol
wasnt this an belgian mc laren? what was it doing in the netherlands
The excitement when the car started 😁👌looking forward to this one 🇿🇦
8:20 MAT'S DAD'S NAME IS TONY!!!
is it just me or this seems so similar to DDEs 720gtr in condition
Hi Mat, go and have a look at Vtuned repair in his McLaren. He had to source an entire tub.
strip it and sent the tub to tavaris and get his bloke to fix it.. would make grate content as well as getting it fixed
Ha!! Your dads name is TONY!
matt phone one of the f1 teams and ask them how do they fix there broken body parts
Amsterdam is not a country!!🤣
Mat it’s ok to say no when someone offers you a fucked car you know.
Amsterdam's a city matt >.<
Fix a new tub, Vtuned did the same if i can recall correct. But thay would be quite expensive(he paid around 10k usa dollar)
SECOND TIME YOUR DADS NAME HAS BEEN ON THE CHANNEL TONY!
Carbon work is not that bad. What a joke Mclaren won't allow there cars to be repaired.
GREEDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
Good luck with the McLaren!
‘The country we are going to: amsterdam’ nice
Mad that Matt’s dad now has a name and it’s Tony hahaha
Send it back lad 😂
There you go everyone. Mat’s dads name is Tony!
Tony an Chris slix make these vids
See what crack is wit carbon bike repair in surrey... can do some serious stuff with bikes
How the hell do you go about trying to buy parts for it especially from  mclaren can’t wait to see how this goes
Well at least it hasn’t been underwater🤷‍♂️
This is the build that gets more viewers matt im invested!!
The country we are flying to is Amsterdam……….erm🤷‍♂️
Amsterdam isn’t a country 🤦🏻‍♂️😂
11:32 Well... if the car starts doing squirrelly things you know who to blame.
Can someone explain to me what that bib like thing that mat wears is for ?
Couldn't hurt to get another assessment(s) at a different location. I'd also get an actual tech to look at it, not some dude in a shirt and tie. 🤞😬🤞
This is a rare race..will you be able to beat the DDE Build. And we need a race and some pictures next Gumball
Finalyyyyy hollandd!!! Come visit me!
I bet a few episodes i will see "I just bought a Pagani Zonda" for a half a price... 😅😅
Sure the tub doctor will fancey a holiday to the uk all exspenses to piss off the snow flakes😂
Where is your green lambo?
Great reviews, says all English reviewers.
As a Dutchie, thank you for your trust in us 😊
We’re on another journey strap it buckle up let’s see where we end up, im in 😮
Tavarish have you seen this he's lost it this time 😂😂good look mat
It will be intrest 😏
Surely it can be repaired somehow, Anything can and if all else fails just do it yourselfs like yous did with all the others including That M5 with the wrecked turret
What's the problem if it still has financing? I know someone who had to turn over her car back to the bank because she still owed on the loan and couldn't pay it. So the bank took to an auction and sold it. At that point, my friend then owed the remaining amount that the auction didn't get. In other words, even if a car still has financing, that's the previous owner's responsibility, isn't it? Or am I wrong? I could be very wrong.
🫡👍🇸🇪
I found Mat Armstrong's father's name his father's name is Tony if I am right plz reply mat and big fan of ur videos
your dad's name is.... Tony!!!! I think
Mat & his mysterious dad “Tony” will fix it I have faith keep it up mat 🔥💯
Finally we know your dads name😂
Easy fix Matt, get it stripped and cut away the damage back to the structural points then graft back in.
Do they want to make this a track car ? How this car could return to open roads with all the regulations ?
Should have just said no and not bought it. Think this is just to far gone
DAD’s name is TONY!!!
Matt sometimes I wonder how can you cope 😂 I would’ve said no
"The dashboard is in German!"...display a screen in French 😂
Think your dads name was said more times in this video than all the others combined 😂  Definitely a big job, looking forward to see some more on this and the Ferrari. HWBT
Mat - are you taking this over to the States? Mate - If you bring it to the USA - Freddy and the frame doctor will work their magic on another broken McLaren!!  It will be fixed as good as new.. Great project looking forward to the reconstruction and the resurrection
Tony !
Iknow the fathers name now though its Tony if i am correct
This is going to be quite a journey, good luck Mat!
TONY!!!!!!!!! Your dad's name is TONY!!
Never give up hard work and hope and it did look bad at gravity  but if any 1 can its going to be mat to find the way 😊
Check out V-tuned when he replaced the tub on his McLaren. Good luck with the build. I'm sure it will be awesome.
ok no hate bro but dudes always saying hes buying mistake cars but fixes it and loves it 😭🤣
So.. the seller didn’t start the car or test the gearbox as he said when selling it? 😳   Matt.. get the cameraman a gimble.. all this camera swinging? 🤢
The Dutch ran it for like , 2secs ! .?? That was honest of them with no fuse and a leaking gearbox! ? Yeah, right !
Kinda a dick move for them to say they haave to see it in person..... and then instantly say no. They could have seen in image and say instantly no.
We just going to notice now that mats dads name is tony 😅😅
Ahem …blimey 😳🤣 this is gonna be a good vid 👍
If you dont push yourself you will never know your limits. Good luck! PS: and your dad name is Tony?
I wish you would finish one before starting another like the lambo isn’t finished the farrari uas barely been touched and now a McLaren i feel like you could easily get overwhelmed and stresses much love tho ❤
Now this is one hell of a cliffhanger
No way would I have bought it!!!!!
Loads of boats are carbon fibre and get hit and repaired all the time.  Take it to a boat place, I know it sounds mad but carbon fibre is all the same whether boat shaped or mclaren shaped… what’s it matter if the repair is maclaren approved or not?
Wicked can’t wait to this id turn this into a flame thrower 1000hp like gallardo 🫣
VTuned replaced the tub on his 720s, and I am pretty sure it was repairable.  Not sure if he still has it?  Good luck Mat!
Good luck
I think its time for a new video layout. Buy salvage car, take a trip to it, car vertical report, look it over for 20min… covid messed us up
There is no such thing as can’t be done, just a matter of how hard you need to try.
Another you tuber called v-tunned rebuild one and changed the hole tub his was in worse shape check out his rebuild.
Please make an updrage to 765LT body kit broooooooo!!!!!!!!
I could swear I heard someone call your dad tony he should be banned from future episodes lol wee patch on the sill seen some videos guys filling s class with bricks an mortar lol anything can be sorted with enough dab loons find another McClaren with   a good tub but bad engine 1 and your laughing lol
Another fantastic project. I hope you can find someone or someone willing to impart the knowledge to repair the carbon tub. Good luck, Matt and keep your chin up. The 720s is an amazing car.
Mat Armstrong X DDE collab who's Maclaren gets fixed first 😂😅
Didn't knew Amsterdam was a country 😁 Guess I'm from Amsterdam after all haha. All jokes aside, you can pull this one off! Good luck💪🏼
Is the country really Amsterdam? 😅
All the videos without mentioning ya dads name now this hahah! Tony you’re a legend! Keep up the awesome work guys!
tbh when u want to buy a car u just see where it came from. Birmingham. Bradford etc etc it will be a write off/repaired car
This is going to be an awesome series
Pyro-fuse can be in loads of different places (Porche Logo) 🤣🤣🤣
All the best luck to you and your team Mat with this huge project!
Old mate dusting his hands off after throwing the quarter panel  on the ground 😂🫶
HIS DADS NAME IS TONY!!! Know we know!! ! Love your videos ! Inspirational to day the least! Keep up the amazing work you do!
Amsterdam is my favourite country in the world! 🇳🇱🇳🇱🇳🇱😂
Was destroyed when it came out the factory left hand drive🤮🤮
seriously Mat I wouldn't have touched that with a ten foot barge pole. The damage is massive and even if you have to break it for spares, not many McLaren owners trawl through eBay to get parts for their car ...
Why would McLaren have to approve a privately owned and repaired?
But any update for the Ferrari??
Tony a legend
VTuned style monocoque replacement?
Just do it yourself! Take off the bad parts and stick in some fiberglass and glue. Its just a dent in a large tub as you call it. No need to have a doctor put on blue gloves and take your money. Its more than strong enough.  Imagine you have a pool made with tiles and one of the tiles was cracked. You glue it back together. Keep on, doing good videos
lol mate...i know you Brits think of mainland Europe as a separate entity....but Amsterdam is not a country !!!
You’ve defo arrived brother 👍🏻
lookin at DDE 720 the rear of the car can be unbolted but ur gonna need some luck with this
Squirrel looking for its stash of nuts gonna be pissed 🐿🤣😂
Can't wait for this one!
You can Save it I believe in you.
Carbon Bike Repair in Leatherhead - good video on YT, their work is flawless - not sure if they can help, but worth chatting to.
But it's your property what could McLaren actually do if you tried to fix it.  Failing that could you not part it out??
Aweseome video and super cool new proiject!!! I love this, can't wait to see how this will end. Btw the country is the Netherlands, not Amsterdam. The city is Amsterdam.
Im dutch too😄😄😄
lots of specialist carbon fibre repair companies in the UK as there's nothing worse than pranging your racing yacht ;)  lets hope someone can help. I look forward to seeing that beauty back on the road.
Amsterdam is not a country lol
Bloody hell, good luck with that mess
No way. Hannah Said matts dads name. Sorry Tony.
So the pyro fuse blows when the airbags go off .. but the airbags didn’t .. so why did the pyro fuse blow? Does it also blow when the car knows is been in a crash?
SO......... HOW the HELL did the dealer start it then allegedly
vTuned repaired a similar damaged 720s and they had to replace the tub. Just give it a shot to the channel to understand the work done. The price is good and if the engine runs and a good tub is available, then could be a nice build!
Mat you should build a car for your father.. it'll be so wholesome
Check the guy from vtuned .. he has done also an McLaren 720s with tub damage. He just bought a second damage one and make 1 out of 2 McLarens. But why didn't you drive it to Louwman in Holland. They could tell you if it was possible or not ..
That car looks mean, but,...... are you planning on making it right hand drive??
good luck Mat thats a big one.
Ah mate, why did you refer to Amsterdam being the country. Ya went to The Netherlands!
So good your dad and you are hilarious
Make it like DDE’s TWIN TURBO !!!🤩
get the v8 out. and swap it into miata or something
Might be worth contacting KS Composites in Old Dalby. I'm sure they make all the carbon bits for Mclaren.
I like youre father, good luck with the "max verstappen" car repair ! greetz the netherlands (not german)
Finally mats dads name came out lol tony
:)
There is little to do on that car. 😂❤
Something tells me that he knows a guy who knows a guy who have a guy for a guy
So annoyed with the approved repairers... State they can't give any opinions without seeing it - ok, fine. But then hardly bother to look at damage and simply state "can't repair anything bigger than hand size". They could have so easily given that basic info prior.
Hi mat i met you at  the gravity show
Im telling right now , this Is better than a movie or a Netflix series
Can't tell from a photo before you've bought it but can tell from 6ft away after you've bought it 🤣
😂 No way can’t believe you got Tony to haul the McLaren all the way back to UK
Can't wait
Was this car from the DJ dark raver?
Mat makes as many big mistakes as High Peak Autos overspends
You did not just buy a 720s.  Get Freddy's guy to repair the tub, fly him in.
did anyone else hear Mr Armstong Snr's name being accidentally revealed?
If you can't fix it, build a kit car out of it 😂
Tony🎉
Try fibre-lyte in stokesley Middlesbrough
What Mclaren won’t fix, MATlaren will tackle 👏👏👏 let’s go Mat! Best of luck with the build!
Carbon frsme dictor will help you! ❤💪👍
Best thing to do was leave that in Holland! Left had drive and crash damaged!😳
Vtuned garage bought a similar McLaren tub for 10 grand USD and was able to repair the rest.
I wonder what happened to the lambo...
Why why why, just find a simple job.
Rich Rebuilds knows how to fix McLaren batteries...he fixed Freddy's replaced the cells
FINALLY... WAS HOPING FOR THE ROLLS ROYCE but hey we flappy with them paddles.
Poor squirrel lost his stock haul
Congrats Matt , all it wants is some fillers and a lick of paint.
You will do it ❤
Look up ‘V Tuned’. He’s a YouTuber that rebuilt a 720 and he’s great.
Insane the amount of content !
Once Again Good luck Matt 😅
I would of passed on this one. Lot of stuff damaged
@vtuned
How annoying.. the company need to see it to assess it... 1 nano second later... yeah we cant touch that!!! Surely they could have done that via face time prior to purchase????
Ur mate said ur dads name it's Toby I don't know if u ever said it before but wanted to say something lol
I'd love to see you do a simpler job on a car like a Focus RS.🔧
My dad… what’s going on Tony?
❤you need to find one with a busted motor and gearbox and front end ,,two into one sorta trick hey !
Be in vtuneds club. He swapped out the carbon tub on his. Gonna be hell of a ride this one
Put the engine in the Porsche and sell the parts
This will be one heck of a job but everyone knows you can fix it
How was this not a Dutch Cat B equivalent 🤯 😂. Everything screamed parts car.
The suspension requires a special tool that only McLaren themselves has to rebleed the hydraulic system an they won't do it for wreck car's so i wouldn't buy that
Mat "Finger crossed" Armstrong.
Batman vs the yellow submarine 😅
TONY! Your dads called Tony, that’s the main thing I took from this video for future Matt Armstrong questions for prizes
❤❤the dutch dont lie ,,,,,na they started it and drove it around with one wheel ,,,30 plus to repair or more maybe is my guess .
You do take a big risk, but I am pretty sure that  you and your team are more than capable to fix it... Beautiful project coming up soon!
This one is going to be 10x harder than tavarish's p1
The P1 seems to be a really unique car and obviously not for amateurs to drive... there will surely be a new P1 with a blown engine but an undamaged chassi
🤔, Porsche don’t sell parts in America but you took them there in your suitcase,       You keep the faith buddy.       Little steps get you to where you need to. TBF the engine worth that 😉
6:01 😂😂😂😂
my dream car!!
Tony!!!!!
i would have walk away in the first 5 min, and gone into the town...lol
Fly the Carbon Doc over from the States!
Try to do a miracle, you have a time to repair it slowly.
Personally, I think the videos would be better if your camera man kept quiet! Really hope you can take this build forward.
you buy that from a Heavyset I reckon? 💀
Buy a new tube like vtune
What happened to Lamborghini??
This is going to be a quick fix 😂
the german dash language was actually french but np xP
Tony's a funny guy 😂😂😂
Yes boss. Everything can be repaired. Just got to find the legend who's willing to it.
where the oil coming from Tony? engine LOOOOOL
Better ask the @goonzsquad about the Carbon repair from the guy in Cali.
Put the engine in something els make a sleeper
Unlike Tavarish McLaren's tjis should be easy 😂
next thing broken LFA in Japan 😂
Amsterdam is not a country????
Yes yes it all seems good 😅
him and DDE building a 720 at the same time!
Yeah this car is way too far gone, no idea why he bought it tbh lol, but that youtube money will cover the loss so, content I guess haha
Tony!💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽still Matts Dad😂
sure he gonna fix this quicker then dde ...
Bro take it to the docks they can take fibreglass and resin fixed in a jiffy
Did I hear a lady call Matts dad Tony?
Always consistently trying to challenge yourself. That's inspiring af bro. Good luck on the new project!
Unless youre prepared to replace the whole tubub. Break it for parts. Even if it could be repaired that would be in no way safe.
"And the country is Amsterdam"... What..? Serieusly 😂
Just have tavarish carbon repair magician fly over to have it fixed!
Time to build this car better than the DDE 720 GTR
TONY!!
Amsterdam is no country😊
By far the best content on u tube
Just found out your dad's name🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Got to admit I think you have aimed a little bit too high with this one. If the tub is trashed the whole thing is not worth considering. Still you could probably break it up and get at least some of your money back, personally I think 60K was too much considering it is in such a state and the guy who sold it to you was lying saying the engine was running.
If anyone  can fix it it would be you.  I like your work
Excited af to see this build! Hopefully you find someone who will fix the tub correctly
I am from Holland. I seen this car
Love your videos
Matt I follow a guy called carbon bike repair on YouTube. He is really good and now does cars stuff as well. He is also in the uk 👍best of luck
That camera guy needs to stay more behind the camera
Im from the netherlands and if u see this car here ist so rare and this guy crasched ut thats just so sad😢
Check out Vtuned he sourced a carbon tub and replaced it
Looking forward to following the journey on this one your fearless love it 😀👍
I’d say that is beyond repairable!
This has to be the biggest challenge yet. I wish you and the team the best of luck with the repair! 👍
looks like exactly like DDE’s 720 .. damage wise
Mat, talk to travarish he's the person that can help you xD
OMG the tension waiting for it to start… I actually cringed watching it!! 🤣 Brilliant video!  👏
The carbon repair guys burnt them, if it was that obvious that just one look seals it they should have first accessed the damage via the photos. Fk they knew instantly that it was a write off.
Mat did they let you have a cooling off period? I think you’ll have to get that guy over from the states to fix the tub…Either way it needs to be stripped. (I hope you got lots of little boxes!) if anything is going to get you over the 2 mill mark, this will be it! Good luck mate 👍
Mat your dad is awesome 😂😂
Might need to find a new tub and swap everything over
This is going to be a banging series!! (Thanks for taking at least 25 minutes of my life every fricking week) 🫡😃
Bro the max picture popping up as he said Dutch people are trust worthy killed me.
Mike Essa the man for advice. Legend.
Mat... was this before DDE had their drama rebuilding their 720 with the suspension ? :P lol not sure if you saw those vids
Hoppa you were in twijzel
You need to do what tavarish is doing to his p1 make it yours loads of custom stuff
Put the reg through we buy any car and see what they will give you 😂
DADS NAME IS TONY!!!!!!
I'm sure I saw a video where someone had a new carbon frame built from scratch, was it not Tavarish
It was cheap for a reason  New carbon tub required
Matt; Where is the oil coming from?!  Dad; Engine 😂😂😂  Thats some gold dad comedy
And the country is....Amsterdam!
Matt, Composite Creations in Swadlincote undertake carbon repairs on race cars and bikes.
Surely if the technician said no so quick, the could of said that after seeing some pictures of the damage before matt purchased it.
aint shocked by the straight up nope from a authorised McLaren repair centre when it comes to frame damage same with most manufactures you got to go with people with no connection to the dealers, ya might have to fly some one out from across the pond ;)
Mike from DDE is a legend and Tim 👊🏾
Break it sell it for parts you should get most of your money back
Having a set downstairs to face what others would turn there back and walk on. Your a freak I love it.
Put the engine and gearbox in a van!!
'' The country we are flying 2 Amsterdam hahahahahhah
Love that Tony finally has a name 😆
Im so hyped for this build, now i can look forward to this build and the Ferrari 🙏 thank you and good luck Mat !! 💪💪
The moment with the dutch being trustworthy and max verstapen I had to laugh so hard 😂😂😂😂😂
TONY
Either new tub or an expensive track day car. How would you even get insurance on that if McLaren say ‘Nah’ ?
There goes Mats' dad name..😅
You're a very brave man with this one Mat......good luck.
The country of Amsterdam. Really?
😂 Will probably have to look for someone not in McLaren’s backyard
How long as your dad (TONY) been on the tools, he seems pritty mechanical minded. MATT ARMSTRONG
Damnnn! You've bought this car in "Twijzel" in the Netherlands.. for my work, I deliver car parts all over in "Friesland" I've seen this Mclarren a couple of times under the sail..   Good Luck with rebuilding this beast, I'm looking forward to all the upcoming videos.  Greetings from the Netherlands.
Matt your Dad is the unsung hero of your rebuilds   he will see you OK!!
Pretty sure you owe tavarish an engine after he gifted you a Ferrari engine..... And he needs a 720 engine.....
I think an air ticket for Tavarish’s carbon repair man might be a good investment
Matt. The Dutch honest😂😂😂😂. Give me a break. They are loads of things and an absolute riot at parties, but I am Belgian and if there is one thing I know about my dutch brethren it's that you have to have everything on paper or they will bamboozle you. They are ruthless, heartless, cruel businessmen who will sell your wife from under you😜(love'm to death btw, we have a weird chemistry going on). I worked carbon in the olden days. Had parts of the MP4-8 pass through my hands. This damage you have there looks bad. May be repairable, but it's going to be borderline. Definitely, and I stress, would not race that car anymore. Streetlegal? Maybe. Racing? Not a chance
MAT YOUR LIFE IS AMAZING YOU HAVE A DECENT GIRL A GOOD SET OF MATES , GREAT CONTENT AND HAVE FUN EVERYDAY KEEP GOING BRO YOU INSPIRING US POOR FOLK LOL
That would have been a nooooo.  All the luck in the world.  you are gonna need it Matt.
Your dad’s name is Tony
Amsterdam isn’t a country…
Mat fly the guy over from America the one who fixed Tavarish's car I'm sure he can help you out.
That squirrel looks to have done an invasive faeces.
sshiiiiiiit bro
I hate the 720s its overhyped and the 765lt is just better and cooler
Sta'A Mo'a
My dream car how does someone do that
Dude stop making 20mins video's 😢
1:56 the dude mentions ur dads name is ur dad okay with that he specified in earlier videos he doesn’t want his name out there
Clever link with the sponsor!!…Seamless…oozes class 🤣
Amazing sweeties upcoming again, but I do think you should of walked away from this one
He said „nah“ inside 10 seconds but couldn’t have come to that conclusion with photos and a video? This is going to be a huge build
I cannot believe you found that key in the locking cylinder. Insane
Repair it just like V-tuned and replace the tub :) but I don.t think you want to hear this advice from a Dutchy ;) Hahaha Thamks for you're visit
Best of luck Mat, will be watching every episode to see how you manage this one! Can’t wait.
Just gonna call dde … they can help… I mean wtf… lol
Fly out the frame doctor to the UK and have the repair done there
£30 easy jet flight to get a £100k plus supercar lol
You guys are always funny. Nice one. Another awesome task wink'😊😊😊
Amsterdam isn't a country mate :D its in Holland aka: the Netherlands!  Love ya tho  :D
Finally we get his name 🎉 big up tony
Need to get a new tub for that bad boy £££££
I think you can be fixed
Loved the Porsche logo 😂
so mat's dad name is tony
We all know his name now - its TONY 😅
2 minutes in i was like "Ohhh, you did a Freddy" :D
Oh for fuk sake, its just carbon fiber. I hate it when its been dealt like it’s unobtainium or something. Clean prep, overlap it a good amount and just laminate the damn frame.  Fix it and get it inspected, jobs good and everyone is happy.  You should see what kind of patches old racing boats get. And they fly on water, that’s just a car.
Quarter of a million views in 2 hours!!! Be rebuilding konigsegg and Bugattis soon haha
There’s no such thing as can’t  Where there is a will there’s a way  Looking forward to this adventure
You went to the capital of my country (the Netherlands, Amsterdam is the capital), which I never expected
The man with the secret name is called Tony 🙂
I mean, at least it hasn't been underwater...
2nd hand tub £35000, swap everything over like vtune
DDE might have some information on how to fix it
1:04 aha my favourite country, AmStErDaM
Matt’s Dad name confirmed?! 8:20
Vtuned garage build one last year incase you get stuck
finish the rs6!
The dashboard was in French....
Tony...the secret is out
big shout to mike essa dde ,,he nows whats what
Watch v tuned he replaced a whole tub on a 720s 👍
The porche logo that appeared when talking about the piro fuse😂😂
Tony ......
The biggest mistake here is calling Amsterdam a country.
Next time you need someone to to a pre-check you can ask me! (In the Netherlands)
His dad is called Tony...🎉
Did I hear someone call MaDad Tony?  😂
Dear Matt, love your vids but Amsterdam is not a country lol
v Tuned in the States rebuilt one of these. He scored a new tub for ten K in Ep 3. LHD?
So excited for this project lessgooo!
The dashboard is in German. Proceeds to show French language XD
How about flying in the guy that repaired tavarish’s 🤔
Wish i could make that hogwartz spell "repairo" work for broken masterpieces
Is anyone else noticed that Mats dad was called ,,Tony "suspicious too many times 😂😂😂
This guy does not sound like Amsterdam. More like Friesland.
Congratulations mat but we need more videos I've watched every playlist waiting man hurry 😭🤣
that was a sneaky Porsche logo you snuck in there when talking about pyro fuses
the good country of amsterdam
Did those guys not say it starts up fine with running gears??? 😢
720…they lose value like there is no tomorrow
Amsterdam is not a country it's the capital of The Netherlands...
Massive respect for taking this one on! you are very brave and I'm certainly hooked and can't wait to see how this one pans out. I guess options are strip it for parts or see if a specialist carbon repair company can do it, obviously not going to be Mclaren approved so that may impact the resale value... but if it passes all safety inspections and it's all documented you might make it work! Good luck with this one!
Finally knowing your Dad‘s name 🙂
Im 5 minutes in, this car looks so much worse than anything he's bought before, I wouldn't have even touched it tbh idk
Build a kit car! Transfer everything over to a kit car shell. That would be sick.
otherwise just rebuilt the engine and sell it...but there's still hope
Did you watch Vtuned rebuild one of these? He had to get a new tub and rebuild it all from scratch. Epic build
amsterdam is my fav country
The journey starts with stripping all car to really assess whats possible.
Your dads a belter , he makes these videos
So, and I’m just saying, the McLaren techs said they could only repair a hole seemingly the size of his hand, if that. Why didn’t they tell Mat that before he bought it? They really didn’t have to see it. Or was this just a bit of theatre from Mat. Just asking.
You need to show us the process of you buying the car!
From never saying your dads name in the video's you went all out in this one! 😅
Gutted! Surely that technician guy could of told you that by looking at the photos you sent, literally said no from looking at it from a distance.  Im sure you figure it out.  Gonna be epic
So paps  called tony
We now definitely know your dad is called Tony now 😂😂
Speechless ,  Matt , just bloody Speechless 😶.
❤❤❤❤
Oh come on Mat Amsterdam is not a country
These are so exciting. Always with the solutions!
This is going to be a big project.
I literally shouted as soon as I heard "Amsterdam"!! Last place I expected as a proud Dutch viewer❤️🇳🇱
Iv said it before but honestly the visuals in your video are as good as anything Iv seen
So mat's dad name is Tony....aight bet😅
Didn’t expect to see a DDE cross over
Did I hear matts dads name at 11:10? It was supposed to be a secret!
The country: Amsterdam. Let's say that Twijzel is not exactly Amsterdam, however only a 1.75 hour drive.
Tony ? Lol
Around 5 mins in I imagine most of us were screaming DONT DO IT MATT!!!
@vtuned did this last year. Tub swap out. Immense job.
Everything is bolted onto the carbon fibre tub so make sure that is ok you may want to watch some of V Tuned videos on his 720s videos
Fly over the guy that fixed @tavarish tub and get HIM on it!
Tony! His name is Tony!
ah yes Amsterdam. my favorite country...
Mat great that door mirror isn’t broken so all you need to do is jack the door mirror up and push a new McLaren underneath and you’ve got yourself a bargain!
If Freddie's carbon guy can't fix it, then you have a 60,000 pound piece of yard art.😂    But I know you will figure something out and this will be an epic build. Good luck!
Well this should be fun…
YESSS YOU FINALLY BOUGHT A MCLAREN!!!  Ive been waiting soo long that you would do a mclaren rebuild! Good luck with it...I'd love to see it fixed some day
Ok, here me out. Maybe @tavarish can help you repair it or sell it to @tavarish so he can use it as a parts car? 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
Not sure I can watch this, 720s is my literal dream car. Painful to see!
Sick that you've went to the Netherlands 🇳🇱
Your dads a legend
I was shouting no don’t buy it hahaha. I’m sure you’ll find away to sort it tho dude.
So glad I got to see this in person at Gravity! 😍
Dude just called Amsterdam a country.
Finish the lambo and the f430!!
With all the people (youtubers) you no ie @tavarish you have the skils and the mindset to smash it,  this will be an epic build ! Get some merch out so we can support this build !!!!!
Bro.... "the country in flying to is Amsterdam".... since when is Amsterdam a country
@Tavarish, send him your guy.. lol
I always take mine out for a test drive before i buy them 😝🤣
I’m definitely up for this one 🎉
This one ....is not a good idea !!!!
Looking forward to seeing you repair this one.
No way your gna fix this for cheaper than buying one
Excuse me sir, Amsterdam is the capital CITY of the Netherlands. 😂
If tavarish can do it so can you 💪💪
Your the man Matt: Big shout from Middlesbrough. Love your-videos
Amazing car.. V-tuned switched the whole tub on his 720s, great series! Can probably help with some things also 👌
Nice bit of B roll, 1:04, 737 winglet but Easyjet don't fly 737's 👀👀
Hah. Its Tony. Yall missing the the important part here.....
One thing look good! Ok I buy
as its LHD, fix it up and I'll buy it!
When the engine cranks up and goes off instantly, that’s most likely the intercooler or the air filter box sensor.
Is your name Mad Armstrong haha ,,, cant wait for the rebuild
My late dad always told me if it’s hard u gotta be hard with it. Matt fix it get it on the road this is hardcore
There’s plenty of excellent boatbuilders / yachtbuilders that know their way around carbon!
Amsterdam is a country??😅😅😅
Get on to easy composites 😊
Did he just call Amsterdam a country??
I live in the netherlands nice to see that you in the Netherlands welcome🎉
You’ve been hanging out with Tavarish too long
Well Matt’s dads secret is out how many times was his name dropped
Hey Mat, what happened to the Ferrari? On your last video you were working on the gear box. How did that end?
Thats not ''involved in an accident''.. Thats ''put through a shredder''' wtf would you buy that xD?
DDE🤙🏼🤙🏼
Stop buying cars and just finish the ones you already have
Change the tub! Will be great content!
You're mad fam! Another gr8 build coming up...
Dashboard was in french. I'm pretty sure about that 😅
28k likes and 240k views in 2hrs, holy sheeeet! Absolutely killing it Matt 🙌
Great video mat, hope you come right, BTW now I know your dad's name 😅
Looking forward to this one
I’m pretty sure by now that nothing phases you Matt, I can’t wait to see this one rise again.
I bet Tavarish comes to Mat's rescue!
love to watch u a Freddy, but been waiting so long thinking and hoping on a Ferrari video, yet u bringing even more cars even more content for us viewers simply amazing keep it up
I have rebuilt a 720s myself! In fact, that yellow crash video McLaren 720s from Dubai that you used for an instant there, i fixed it :)
Buy a new cfrp tub
That's a BIG RISK mat 😮
We’re all on this journey with you Matt!!
Speak to Optimum motorsport. They run 720S's in British GT. Either they have a carbon guy or a source for a whole new tub.
But the guy who sold it to you said he had the engine running and both engine and gearbox are ok🤬😪
Mat , good luck with this build. Hope that this is the only crack you have on the body.
It is not psobile to repair carbon fiber and get back the orginal strenght.... It is a huge risk to fix a critical part like that...
Love these vids Matt like your Dad.take it back! Brilliant!!can’t wait to see what back street garage you use..I wondering if there’s guys on YouTube who can or know a place.can’t wait mate also the Ferrari….
How many times have we deafeated the odds. Too many times!!! Its repairable mate.
Ask Tavarish for his carbon fibre mans number and fly him over? Nothing he couldn't fix 🤔
Few videos ago, Matt's dad, "Don't say my name they don't know it..." this video...
Seeing dde troubles rebuilding there’s crashed in same spot but less damage hope u ready for an expensive build
Mat with u there is no wrong choice only hope and believe
Time to rewatch all those DDE vids,I see you have magic Mike on face Time lol. Keep up the great content 👌
Three side body fix and no certainty on the engine.
Now what? Now you get to work.
So Matts Dad is called Tony? Mustve missed that.
"The country we're flying to? Amsterdam."  Might want to rethink that...
Now for a race? 👀🤣
Ship the car and all the parts to the states and keep it overseas for future filming
The country we are flying to Amsterdam 😢
I remember Vtuned bought a used tub for $10k when he repaired his McLaren, maybe Matt can snag one for a good price?
im sure u can fix it u and the others continue the great the work!!!!!
This is going to be some journey. Good luck boys
"The country we're flying to Amsterdam" 💀
TONY ARMSTRONG!!!!!!
Fly old mate out from the states and get him to work his magic. Or find a tub. Everything is repairable 😅
The country of 'Amsterdam' 😂
Finally we know, Mat Armstrong's Dad's name is Tony.
You will have to get Freddie's carbon guy to fix it and master Yoda Ricky at RE to help with the mechanical stuff good luck cant wait to see it done         😎👌
£5000! My carbon fibre road bikes having a frame repair at the minute. That’s going to cost me £800!! 😂
Intrigued with this one already Mat. Crack on!
A lot of "if's". "If" there are no oil leaks, "if"  you drill them out, and "if" the rear subframe is good.. And yet I know this will be a fun rebuild.
Vtuned replaced the whole front tub on his build, I'm sure.... good luck and have fun , at least ive got something to watch 😂..
First time I have heard your dad's name mentioned on your channel Good to finally know it
The country we are flying too... "Amsterdam"... all the Dutch people looking at each other like WTF bro....
All that damage still the airbag is okay
goonzquad had tub repairs on one of there builds and I think vtuned just swapped the tub on his mclaren
1:05 Amsterdam is a city, not a country🥲
@MatArmstrongbmx we defo need a pyrofuse explainer T-shirt! Happy to design it for free, just give me a shout
YouTube must pay heaps
Tavarish has a guy
Yes mat!🎉🎉
i enjoy watching you and your dad. i sure miss my dad lost him this year :(
I’ve just found out your dads name is Tony 😁! nice job you are doing there man!
Awesome to see Michael from DDE camio.. big respect for Mike!! ❤  Loving these videos so much man.. I need more!
personally i wouldnt have got that as its LHD makes it pointless in the uk
Mat this is becomming an addiction you gotta go to thrapy😂
lol this is a car that Tavarish would obviously approve of since he's already fixed 1 crashed Mclaren and is now working on that Flood Damaged one
Mat at 8:31  what is that you wear on your chest? Always been curious
The carbon fibre guys could have said no from a picture or video. They said they can only repair a small area and it was obvious from the pictures it was more than that.  Why did they make you bring it in?
Amsterdam is not a country
Yikes. 😮
Should’ve taken that £60k to the casino. If you doubled it you could’ve bought one that just needed tlc. And if you lost it, you’d be in almost the same position as you are now.
Make it a track weapon
They said his dad’s name!!!! Hello, Tony!
"the country were flying to, Amsterdam"  is Amsterdam not a city?
That guy could have told you no from a mere photo. If he says no bigger than (makes a circle with fingers) then he would have saved you £60k
Matt I think that’s gonna be a big nightmare Hopfully your ok on this one but I think that’s a bad choice
Paused the Video to post this comment at 6:35 into the Video!   Rule Number 1: Always carry Pyro fuses  Rule Number 2: Price headlights….. just incase 😂  Now back to the video ❤🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Where's the oil coming from? The engine. Love it!! 🙂 Great to see you have taken on a McLaren project and the 720s is quite a beast. Loving what you guys are doing, such a great team. Makes me want to quit my day job and do the same.
Love ur videos man. I'm quite bit sad today cuz my A/L results came and it wasn't good at all. Then I saw u posted. Man like always u lighten up my mood. Thanks for doing this and I'm so excited to see end results soon. Good luck Mat ❤ Love from Sri Lanka ✌
Take it to a carbon boat specialist, those guys can work wonders!!
Country where we are flying to: amsterdam hahah
Vtunned garage Swap the tub
You got this, keep em coming
Matt just watched your video then to the end and I herd you mention the carbon fiber doctor 😮 I'm sure your friend carbon doctor may need to come over to the UK and show them how it's done lol, I seen the work he done on Freddy's yellow McLaren on the undertray man I'm guessing that he may be your man here matt, good luck man I know your gona figure something out one way or the other!. 💯💯👌👍
Did someone say Mat's dad's name again? 😮
Ok, so that looked pretty bad!  Id guess its not gonna get it cert over here, gotta take it somewhere with no safety regs if you wann repair that and sell it. I'd say US in one of their States where you can drive any old heap of shite if its got plates, or Easterm Europe, maybe somewhere else thats no MOT type regs. Thats a gutter, but what can you do?  Im betting odds-on youll ship it to Tavarish by next week lol 😂🤦🏻🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇬🇧
Mats's father's name is Tony.... Reveal of the century!!!!
Look for specialist from Poland we can repair everything :D
Dutch are trustworthy till it comes to the coco plant
Amsterdam is not a country but our capital city 😜
I sense a Tavarish, DDE collaboration is needed for this one!!! How amazing that would be, the best automotive content trio out there!!! All three building bad arse McLaren builds happening at the same time!!
This is the build I’m looking most forward too now!!👀
Buy a McLaren with front end damage and mix the cars together or but a new tub for it (35k) 😬😬😬😬
Scrap metal guy here in Belfast said he’d take it off your hands. Lol
Halfords fiberglass 😅
Of you bought it lol.    But because of the carbon damage, I would say Steer Clear.!   But I know you will buy it regardless. 🤣🤣🤣
Not sure whether it's already been mentioned but there's a carbon fibre specialist called Remas in Daventry northampton u.k, I have seen them carry out carbon repairs on a buggati chiron, they specialise in this kind of thing, maybe worth checking them out?
Catering to the American viewers by calling Amsterdam a country 💀
Not with Chris's barge pole Matt! 😅
ID WALK AWAY FROM THAT ONE😮
I got faith in you an instant " no" is a delayed "yes"
Finally mats dad name  Tony!! 😂 don’t know if you lot caught that
Dashboard was in french..
Respect DDE boys and Tavarish  to support you i guess :) Nice Car same like Audi :)
Haven't watched the vid yet but ik this will be good. Suggestion: Maybe get a Ryft body kit for it
So he’s Tony Mystery revealed
I love how we all just go "Must be the pyro fuse." LOL
So if the McLaren approved repairer can only sort out a hole about 100mm max. diameter I’m not quite sure why they couldn’t have said that via an email.
Tonyyyyyy
the beautiful country of Amsterdam
It's your car not Mclaren's this is UK bullshit, anything is possible in the USA just fly over Tavarish's guy to fix it.
you should get the gtr kit for it and make it like DDE's
If the suspension system is damaged and has lost hydraulic pressure, it is very expensive. I watched a video from a channel DDE When they fixed their McLaren
it was only a metter of time before you got a mclaren cannot wait to see this build
Tony🧏🏼‍♂️
Fly Tony the tub over to sort it 👍🏻😀
Might have strip it sell it for parts
Mat fly over the "carbon doctor"  from the USA you'll manage bud you always do keep it going
Oh man, I had to watch this twice! Crazy Mat, but if anyone can pull this off it’s you!
mat watched DDE 720s rebuild too xD
Tavarish needs cheap parts, sell or ship it to him.
Amsterdam is not a country
Hi matt dont think its transmission fluid more like squirrel pee😊
Love your content bro. Always something fresh and interesting. You really do keep humble even with all your success. Long may you continue bro. You are an inspiration to so many.
Amsterdam is the city, not the country. Nice video!
Yeah : now I know the name of Matt’s Dad … Tony 🥳🥳
Matt, you need to get in touch with @Vtuned who had the same issue with his 720S.  He had to swap tubs and rebuild the entire vehicle.  He did it by himself and it's very doable.  Check him out.  Best of Luck!!!
Oh dear
Strip it, ship it to the Guy Freddie used 👌🏻
What a cheek from a slimey company! "We can only tell you by seeing it in person" then instantly say no without hardly looking at it. Could have told you from a picture in an email or just said to you "we'll only fix less than approximately 10cm holes if it's more then avoid purchacing"  Bet they charged for rhat aswell.
👍
I'm struggling to understand why the specialists needed to see it in person given how quickly and easily they could give a verdict and how limited they are on carbon repair authorisation.
TONY   Finally found out matts dad's name 😂😂
Matt, you have bigger balls than King Dong taking this on…….Awesome and thanks for making great vids 👊
His dad's name is tony
V tune channel. He replaced tub
either,  but one that has had a front end, and make one good car, plus some parts, break it...or make a track car out of it    As a cat D, it is not 130k....I don't know, b7t I would guess a damaged, repaired 720s is 100k
Still waiting for a amg gt 😅
Ok, so I’ve seen the other projects and always just never said anything here, but this time… like the squirrel, I’ve been trying to find the words about the sheer madness. Sure this was a bargain but that’s a very expensive paper weight. 😂😂😂 When I see the Mac boys say no way, I’m like but… there is a Matt way. I can only wish you GL, you crazy crazy man. 😅
Those “repair” guys could have told that NAH according to a few good pictures. 🤯
looks like your gonna have to fix it yourself, get on it!
i don‘t think that rebuilding a car in this condition is reasonable at all…. this car will never be safe again… don‘t you think that you risk your or others life/s in the case of a second accident. everbody including me respects your for the entertainment and your skills, but this time: just let it be mate
Take the engine and trans out and put it in a Lotus Europa.
His dad's name is tony
I love the country of Amsterdam. Holland is even better.
Already looking forward to the "I took my car to McLaren" video at the end 🙂 go team Armstrong 💪
This is going to be fantastic and epic !
Matt: Mr Entertainment.  Best of luck with this one. In your Dad we trust. 🤞
Amsterdam is not a country😂
So we finally know DADs name... anyways I love this channel spirit
Pretty sure that bloke could have said ‘nah’ if he’d seen a detailed pic.
16:42  on no oils coming out 😂😂 ahhh the cars going mental oh no oh no me 😂😂😂😂 at least get hit by an airbag😂😂😂😂
It's a huge risk having to buy before you could check. Hopefully you end up with a positive outcome guys.
Hold my beer, Matt’s Dad is called Tony! And he does have skills, apparently the oil leak came from the engine 🤣.
King Mat.
Watch vtune, he had to do a complete rebuild for 720. May want to watch.
What a project, biggest challenge so far I guess. Lets do it! 🔥
oh snap!!! this is gonna be sick!
I have faith in Mat and his team 🤞🏼
Tony is Mat’s dad - wooohooo. The biggest mystery ever is solved.
Strip the car to bare tub and find a carbon fiber parts specialist and ask them if they can build you a new tub using the original tub for measurement. Then that company can supply brand new upgraded tubs for future customers or even for a kit car builders.
Congrats 👏🏻 Matt! You deserve every bit of it!! 😂 not kidding congrats for the upgrade!!
The bad think with the carbon fiber is that if its broken onces you can not glue an other part like with the normal cars. And maybe you will fix it but you will not be safe anymore inside this car. And BTW, where is the lambo?
geez this man was in my region in friesland 😅 how bummed me from here
This is gonna be good... All the best matt.
Time to go back to Tavarish' garage and hit up his carbon guy.
”The country we’re flying to, Amsterdam” the city got promoted to a country
... take all the bits out and build a car from scratch?
Mat and Tavarish build battle 😂 awesome content guys.
Strip for parts I feel 😮
Dde and Matt mclaren team up when done?
Never would I buy a Mclaren even if I was rich
YOu are nice guy , but pls stop every single video ,i made a big mistake.... OK !!!
Don’t know why they couldn’t tell you ‘Nah’ from the photos.
I swear if he can fix this McLaren...his the greatest of all time Dr mechanic
Bro porsh
The country we’re flying to? Amsterdam 🙃
Tony!!!!!!!!!!!
Strip it down to the chassis and ship to tavarish mate who did his P1 Problem sorted and then mod the engine to get more power and of course then have some fun!
Surely there's over £60K in parts there, strip it down and sell it off in bits???
Amazed Independent cars couldn’t tell you that from a picture especially when they are only allowed to conduct small repairs. Shame they wasted your time!!
Mat, quick suggestion. In the thumnail blur the car so it makes it more exciting, cant wait to see the build
Tested the engine and gearbox my arse!! 😂 Good luck with this one Mat!
All the best guyss😂😂😂
"laughs in financial mistake" i fell you man
Who does your Fire Safety? I can happily help ya. Cheers Matt
i wonder why mclaren wont fix it
So err when are you offering Freddy's carbon guy an all expenses paid trip to the UK? .......😅  you got this,it wouldn't be fun if you weren't pushing the boundaries ...............
You’ve given your dads name away
Amsterdam is not a country xD
Fly the guy out who fixed tavarish tub or there must be someone in the UK who knows carbon? Whoever does it not going to warrant it anyway so nothing to loose. Keep up the crazy builds
Worst case you can part it out and make your money back.
Well. If he can fix it, he can use the motor for something else 😊
What about the Ferrari Matt?
I think you will be lucky to get the parts for that Matt but good luck 😊
Sell it
Another one!  😮
There is a company in Poland called ECPS Group. They've already fitted the Lexus LFA so I don't think the McLaren will be a problem... :D
Ya crazy bin dipper............Good luck
" the country we are flying to", Amsterdam??!! That's the capital city man of Holland (Netherlands)!!😂😂  but nevertheless, love your channel Armstrong!!😊
it’s like deja vu to the dde vid
Mat you are my favorite content creator on youtube hands down, thank you for the consistent content!
Hop the best for u and ur projects❤
I hope you know Amsterdam is not a country haha
If your after geniune AP racing mclaren calipers let me know, I'm only down the road from you in Coventry
Lambo, RS6, Ferrari, Mcllaren, .... daymn bro you can multitask
Hint or tip , Amsterdam isn’t a country.
Should do a series "ask toneh" 😂
hope they accept returns in Amsterdam
Sound stupid, but why do you need McClarens permission to repair it?
So... When are you flying Mr T's carbon guy over
Walk away
Me watching this:  DON'T BUY IT DON'T BUY IT  DON'T....
Aww.. That's nothing man.. Couple of kettles of boiling water will get those scuffs out matt!!.. Lol
Runnnnnnnnnnnn 😂
If you want some tips Vtuned has rebuild one of these(replaced the tub) his videos could help.good luck
Aww....and you gave your Dad's name away in this one 😂
Dutch people tend to be honest. LOLOLOL
Fly the carbon fixer guy over and pay him he can sort it or ship it to USA
I can’t wait to see how this one goes
The steering wheel is on the wrong side of the car
I think you need to invite everybody from USA Tavarech and  DDE, It will work.
Give it to CarSOS. I bought cars from Dutch dealers with rusted leaking petrol tanks, no disclosure etc. so I must disagree with you. I risked my life driving it for a week until I smelled it. It could have exploded while driving it or burned the house down. They should give it to you for free for the bravery of wanting to fix it.
The engine runs Source: Trust me bro 🤣🤣🤣
That well known "country" Amsterdam 🤔🤣
Welcome to the club  I fixed one myself all the way down in South Africa
Good luck with the build bro
was that a name leak at 8:20?
country Amsterdam... :D
I’m thinking to gone a little too far with this. U not making anything on this 1. As for a competition car, no thanks. Not without a new hud. To many many long nights. See u after Xmas with this 1 pal. Good luck
Amsterdam is not a country 😂
put a 765 lt rear bumper
The videos are brilliant , but I think this one is a step too far . But I’m sure you will prove us wrong
I'm fully confident you will get it done MAT!
Mat talk to VTuned, he did that a few years ago!
Collab with @Vtuned - he's been here before (though I'm sure it was a re-shell route)
@ 8:19 --->  Mama Armstrong lettin' it slip !   😄
You certainly enjoy a challenge Mat. Good luck with this one-no doubt at all that you will smash it again 👍🏻
All the best for this one Mat. . . Can't wait 🎉
Tony!!!!!! 🤫
Watching your videos I bought a broken audi too 😂
Your accent is really funny bro 😂😂😂
I may have seen your dad driving this back in early July when I was driving back from France!!! Would that be him?? I remember telling my brother to look at that McLaren at the back of that truck!
This is gonna be one hell of a build. Let’s hope there’s a way for mat to figure a way to fix this one. Cause the Ferrari and this one are the biggest so far.
different league now 😂🤣
Can't wait to see it on the Road trip to Monaco 🔥😁❤
Yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah boy!
12:00 “The dash is in German!” Proceeds to show French text😂
Did I hear Matt’s dads name there 👀👀
Would be great to see you swap the engine and gearbox into a completely different car.
Well his dad is Tony
I LOVE HOW ALL YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER (DDE-TAVARISH-MAT) THIS ONE LOOK HORRIBLE BUT IM SURE YOU WILL WORK YOUR MAGIC AS USUAL
For anyone who dosent know mats dad name is tony 13:32
Send it to Florida
Its so easy for McLaren to say no
Nice, i hope you will buy wrekced bugatti for the next project😀
That’s a no go for me the dents in the subframe
Your dad is lovely mate
Is it me or is Mr Tony Armstrongs' name mentioned alot in this video so viewers know his name for a future pop quiz🤔... I bet it's only gonna be this video where his name is mentioned, JUST A HEADS UP FOR YOU ALL🤷🏿‍♂️  LOVE from 🇿🇦❤ Mat and the team!!
Strip the Tub and take it to Freddie T,  piece by piece on a plane 😉😉
thought you were being dramatic when you said you may have made a big mistake as we’ve heard that before. but after the techs saying no within 0.8 seconds, i see your point 🤣
Fantastic series, so entertaining! I’m really excited about this build!
I can repair that tub. I’m based in Denmark, but we can figure something out, if you can’t find someone locally
Freddy should have warned you 🤷🏼‍♂️
Looks like a UK Vaca for Tavarish’s carbon man! Carbon Dr. on the way!!!
He’s learned to name his videos with deceptive headlines…. ‘I’ve made a massive mistake “ can actually  mean I lost a bolt in the dashboard
Kkkkkkkkk😊
Dad's name is TONY!!!!!  TONYYY
Tony DAD where would you start? - Amazing project what can I say!!!
Fly over Freddie's carbon guy and have him fix it
TOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNYYYYYYYY
best purchase ever, mclaren 720s are some of the best!
❤ what about Ferrari ?
Oh yes, Amsterdam my favourite country
Maybe you can part it out and get some of your money back :)
Tony's son here has bitten way more than he can chew but...... There's a saying somewhere that a man who endeavours to swallow a coconut has absolute faith in his butt hole.  😂😂
Why don’t you use a jump lead to bypass the pyro fuse
take big risks, win big. looking forward to this build. i would have walked away the minute i saw the damage to the tub.
New car series whose excited🥳
Yeah Amsterdam is a country
It’s fantastic to see you on a call with the DDE guys! 🎉
MCLAREN WONT FIX, Fix it yourself regardless =D  I am sure someone out there must have the skills and tools for help with that carbon fiber.  We have confidence you can fix this car!
worst case, you pull the engine and swap it into something for another crazy build
This is the first time i've seen a car and thought "Mat will properly struggle with this one", have fun lad!
That emblem in the corner was a editing error, don't worries guys.
Bit crap that the technician couldn't have told you of the size limit of the damage before you bought it, instead he wanted to see it 😒
Why couldn't they tell you they couldn't fix it on the video call? Especially when there a limit to the size of damage which they can fix?
Saw you reveal the 720s at gravity, its going to a challenge but its going to be a good one as always
Netherlands is my city 😆
The country we are flying to is 1:03.......Amsterdam? Lol. You mean Holland or the Netherlands dude.
Calling Amsterdam a country baffled me
I think amsterdam is a nice country too 1:04
Sometimes you have to say no 😂
"....the country we're flying to? Amsterdam...."   😂
hello Mat would love to see you race against Mat some day on car wow
U cud drop a car in a volcano and matt wud try fix it
The country we are flying to... Amsterdam. Bruh
I see you trying to be like DDE
Mat is actually crazy, you flippen legend!!!😂❤
Any chance mclaren would sell you a chassis  , good luck , I’d love to see you rebuild this Matt
Brave haha, I'll buy it for 50 quid 😅
Best YouTube channel ❤
any 720 CF  tubs floating around out there?
Get in there Matt
Obviously you will fly over the guy who fixed Tavarish P1 under body... So go for it 👍🏽
BRO YESSSSSSSSSS.
Loved the quick Porsche simbole flash
Since when have we started calling mats dad by his real name
Always nice when Chris is along for the job 👌🏻
Tell Tony I'm his number 1 fan,  the new Ed China 😂
Have I missed something, but what happened the lambo? Did it ever get completed / painted etc?
I was screaming “Don’t buy it!!!” while watching this video.
Are u allowed to do the carbon repair urself if u do a good job of it?
ouch could be a 60k mistake mat but iam sure tavarish knows someone who can repair the tub
good luck with this project but i don't get the appeal of a LHD one
LETS GOOOOO
If Freddie can fix a flooded p1 you can fix this one!
god we love you team armstrong
“The country we are flying to… Amsterdam”😂😂😂
👍🏼🛠🚙
Legend!
From the pictures you could tell it was as big as your hand and he shows you can only fix a small area should of just said no from the get go I would be heated
Finally we know your old man’s name  And why did the Porsche emblem flash up
Nice one Matt !! Can you do more videos than Freddy haha (Sorry Freddy )👍🏻
Welcome to taverish world
Mat I know that a youtuber by the name of Vtuned Garage has done a 720s rebuild years ago and could potentially help.
She leaked his dads name
Amsterdam is not a country....
Wow Matt. This’ll be a bumpy ride 🤩👍
Just wrap new carbon over it.
Money Pit😂
I admire his passion, but a car in this state shouldn’t be put back on the road
"The country we're flying to? Amsterdam" Sorry but I burst out laughing HAHAHAHA
Tony! Tony! Tony!
Time to buy Joey the Frame Doctor, a trip across the pond
Mc Claren set you up there. All they needed was a photo of the damage. To do the assessment. But instead they made you buy the car.
@12:25 - 44 Days and 44 nights
Vtuned garage Swapped his tub on his Mclaren 720s
bro dde been through it/going through it good luck.
I speek dutch
The country.....Amsterdam🤦‍♂️ shall we just call that the capitol and call my country the Netherlands please. I refuse to live in a country that would be called Amsterdam😂
The country we are flying to is: "amsterdam" 💀💀
Tavarish had a guy repair a Carbon tub that he rebuilt maybe he has a hint for ya ..
Matt, talk to some good Aviation composite engineers. They’ll have it fixed better than McLaren could. A good aviation composite engineer mind!!!
As soon as you seen the damaged to the tub then it time to walk. Good luck.
You keep pushing the finish line! Awesome bro! There's nothing you're afraid of! Bless you bro!
It is turning now totally mad! 😂
I’m wondering if you could get your hands on an old cockpit mould or even a broken mould from somewhere and build your own new part? The carbon lay up specs are probably online somewhere. Then it’s just a case of a wet lay up and vac. You could strip the broken one down and use that as a plug to build your own mould from?
The country we were flying to... Was Amsterdam.
I think that is one car too far mate
dent master could sort that out🤣
Matt 🤝 DDE 🎉❤
I'm half Dutch and I wouldn't trust anyone on that side of the family 😂
DDE & Matt YSOB 👍✨️🏁
Same agenda as usual then..
You're mad!
You could have said no.
"Tony are you ready" I guess we know your dad's name now
Ah yes. The country "Amsterdam" 🤣
if Mclaren cant fix it Mat  Armstrong can and will get it done!
Nothing ventured nothing gained get it sorted Matt
Feature short history over
Big up tony
Can't say It enough but I really wanna come work with you and your dad fixing up these cars.  Pay me in tea and biscuits, give us a dogbed to kip in and I'm happy 🤣
Brave man 😊😍if you can glue a BMW together you can do this car 100%  Get it on a jig .get the carbon panels from other rite off and cut out the parts and glue it up  This is going to be awesome
I'm glad you opened that door Matt I've seen this before on another Chanel they totaled his McLaren because of the exact place where the carbon fibre was smashed in, you'd have to look in to it fela his channel was called tall guy car review and it was on his Chanel 2/3 years ago you see the accident actually happen aswell a car side swiped his McLaren and was only a dent on the door but the carbon fiber tub behind the door was similar to yours matt, good luck with your new build looking falward to seeing this getting put back on the road  m8 brilliant m8!. 💯💯👌👌👍👍
I really think they did not have the engine running like they said.  Part it out or sell it get your money back
Brave man 😊😍if you can glue a BMW together you can do this car 100%  Get it on a jig .get the carbon panels from other rite off and cut out the parts and glue it up  This is going to be awesome
and Max Verstappen is the best
Your Dad name it’s Tony🎉🎉🎉🎉
I saw what you did there, Verstappen. Nice touch 😂😂
Good luck Matt i think is gonna take 5 months to back this car on the road but im sure you gonna make it.We all belive  in you bro😁🤙🤜👍
Love from Portugal!! I want to start rebuilds too❤
Freddie is a bad influence on Matt…
You’ve arrived sir 😂👌🏻🍺🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿
Arrrgh Mat - This is called being caught with the bag! They guy that sold it you would have already been told no repair possible!!! I think your best bet is to strip it down so you can see the damage then try get Tavarish to pull some strings on a repair for you! I so hope you do it!
720s is definitely one of my all time favorite cars so im very excited that you got one ...but damn dude that gash is serious.. very cool to see DDE in the vid , the only other 720 rebuild I've seen was Vtuned Garage so check that out if you haven't. They had to replace the tub hopefully you dont but it is possible.
shesh best of luck with this one!
that porsche logo when referring to the pyro xdd
Now i know the name of  Mat"s dad... Tony i think😂😂😂😂😂Yeeeeeeh
Vtuned bought a tub for 720s somewhere in England for less than 10000 a couple of years ago. Besides that Tavarish, who just welcomed you to the club can ship you his carbon fiber doctor :))) His P1 will give material for u-tube videos till he retires :)))
Omg ! That technicians face 🤣🤣🤣
That carbon fibre damage doesn‘t look good, i can‘t see how you would repair that. Mat might have to buy a new monocoque an basically build the car from scratch.
Tavarish had tub rebuilt.
Worth a tidy sum in parts, easy your money back
Shout out to Porsche 😂
the most expensive plastic bucket in the world... hope you find a way to fix it 🙂
I like how Matt has to hold his own oily finger like he can’t trust himself not to poke himself in the face.
Should have used the CarVertical before buying
Very brave Mat! Worst case, break it, you’ll make money, but we all know how tenacious you are, you’ll find away!  The very best of luck mate, can’t wait to watch it’s repair OR breaking progress ??
noooooooo, well, it would be interesting if Maclaren donated a new cabin to you, since your channel is very interesting and could serve as advertising
DON'T DO IT MAT DON'T BUY IT
And here I was hoping he would buy Lewis Hamilton's old pagani
Mat we need an murcielago update?
Nah! 😅
As it is a lefthand drive car, when it is time to give it away. You have to let us in Europe have a chance to enter then😉
Sometimes one right picture could save £60000 haahaahaa
@ Damon and Dave 😂
The way he made that decision so quickly they wouldn’t touch it I’m sure a video call in Holland they would’ve advised the same . I smell a rat here !
Sorry my protective text is kicking
Walk away it’s a basket case
Looks like someone crashed at the ring  No airbags went off is a worry with that much damage
They could of told you that from the pictures!
Part it out and onto the next!
Shut the pouch from your microwave onto the tub
Oh now we know matt's fathers name. Good luck on the build.
So....strip the car down, send the tub to Florida,  find new doors and body parts...yeah this is turning into the Euro Tavarish channel.   Lol. Good luck Mat
What a madness
Apparently, Amsterdam is a Country!
It's gonna be complicated, the lambo and the Ferrari are still in the workshop, and the 720 is really a race car first rather than a normal car, can't wait to see it happen and revive from the ground up !!! Great show getting us surprised all the time. You are a legend Mat. Can't wait to see how you are going to source the parts 🙂 Tavarish will help you for sure !!!
The country... Amsterdam. 😂 I know what you mean but it was funny. Cheers mate. 🍻🥰
I saw the damage and I think it's possible make the repairs on carbon fiber. I'm a composite technician and carbon fiber repair technician. One of my jobs was to repair the fuselage from airplane parts and some of them are structural parts.
The Batman flash on the screen made me pmsl
Can you buy a new tub for it
Im not so keen on McLarens and i think this one is going to be more hassle than its worth.  I'd really like to.see Mat attempt a JDM car like the Skyline. Maybe import one from Japan....
it's in another country called..... Amsterdam!!!
14:40 I’m surprised you don’t have a selection of pyro fuses on the shelf by now lol 21:07 you need to fly out Tavarish’s carbon guy and his tools
The country we're flying to - Amsterdam
6:48 as a Dutchman I appreciate this
Lol gearbox was tested and works.... drivesharft hanging out of gear box???
DDE will buy it for parts lol. I'm only  2:12 into the video and curious it the carbon tub is damaged
Tony 😂😂
Ámsterdam is not a country Mat. 😂
Just bond a bit of RSJ in there, they keep houses up 🤣
nice car matt do you  want to know the price of a engine for a McLaren 720s is £3000000000 used on ebay
Dutch people do be trustworthy he says I'm very flattered 😂
Get Freddie's Guy to repair it.😮
It's cos you're friends with Tavarish thay sent you an email to offload their crap 😂 I'll say that will never see the road again.
Talk to vtuned he did his mclaren he changed the tub etc
YOUR DADS NAME IS TONYYYY
Love the stuff mat keep going you can fix this car you always do.  ❤❤
You are always saying you've done a big mistake when you bought those crash damaged cars😂😂
15K likes in 1 hour🤘great progress, as a channel & individual Mat
Over priced for a car that gets left in the middle of Dubai dessert
00:03 you always say you did a big mistake 😂
his name is toni!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! u blew the mistery :D
TONY!
I hate waiting for the updates to these videos because they such good videos each time😂
Cant wait for the next video upload
NAME THE CAR FREDDY!!!!!
as someone who lives in NL for 15 years. Some dutch people are trust worthy and some are absolute pirates. they make a sport of ripping nice (Buiterlanders) off. Do not assume their level of English language means they are to be trusted. If it sounds to good to be true it normally is, that's international
This country has a massive number of carbon tub experts - honestly that is not massive issue....you'll never get a Mclaren warranty and it definitely will cost a fair bit - jigs, materials, labour, but a good specialist will sort it and it will likely be stronger than the rest of the tub. Good luck with the build!
7:23 Spoilers haha! The McLaren on the back of the trailer at his workshop in the advert before he says if he's bought it or not 😂
Didn’t know Amsterdam was a country 😏
Hey Matt, a guy called V-tuned garage recently rebuilt  720S, he even had to replace the whole tub, take a look at his vlog you might get a few interesting tips, good luck mate its an awesome car.
Nobody knows what mat dad's name but at 11:10 they say his name is Tony like if u heard it ❤❤❤
You must have gone to a cafe in Amsterdam before making that purchase mate! 🤣
Wut a Madman. I'm not a car expert but fixing carbon fiber stuff should be no joke, good luck Mat ;) Love from Italy
Fly the guy over from the USA and let him do the repair.
@DDE
I don't think you will be able to get parts for it.
The country we are flying to....... Amsterdam😂😂😂😂😂😂
Verstappen trustworthy?!? HA
Can you not separate the tub from the frame and sent it by itself to the states for repair?
You can fix but it will cost £££££££££
the end .........
Oh man, even by your usual standards - this one looks ROUGH 🤣
@DDE @MIKEESSA
If you get it fixed, pleasu tune the crap out if that thing
You are a very Brave man Matt :)
oh your dad's name is Tony! 😄
If Vtuned repaired that one you're golden dawg
The car is utterly and truly toast. It makes Tavarish's P1 "submarine" look like a breeze. You'll sweat Mat. You will sweat, a lot 😂😂
“The country we’re flying to…Amsterdam”
Didn't know that my city was a country😂
This will be an epic series !!!! Give freddie a ring im sure he will help you out with his knowledge
1:04 Aah yes, the country of Amsterdam.
The answer maybe to strip it down to the good parts and find an undamaged vehicle with a blown engine and box. If nothing else, break it for spares and try to cut your losses....as if you would ever do that Mat!!! Whatever happens, the  very best of good fortune on this one. Cheers, Bob
It’s more fun when they put the pyro fuse in an awkward place. Porsche would understand
Go for it Matt.
The country is Amsterdam? Bro, that’s our capital 😂
shiii now you can smoke when you work on your car
Nice 720s swap for something?
HIS NAME IS TONY, or are we being bamboozled.
Tavarish & V-Tuned just entered the chat
Dad TONY 😅
Fly the frame doctor over 🛫
I think the frame doctor will have to have a working trip to London, or have a word with the carbon company that Tavarish bought the P1 body kit from.
McLarennnnnnn..lessgoooooooo
Im intrigued & all vested in this rebuild!  Bring on the next video...
And so, the journey begins... 🙏 Good luck!
So if they can’t repair it, how much is a replacement tub?
Deffo the biggest build yet! 🙌 (Hope you returned that squirrels food) 😄
It's strange that with a 2 seconds look he said no but the same 2 second look from a photo and they couldn't tell? I'm sure the frame doctor will help for sure, but then again I saw one YouTuber replace the entire tub. Vtuned I think it was.
I think it’s a good buy. Once you’ve replaced every single part, you’ll have a spanker 👀
So his dads name is “ Tony “ !!
get a 1016 front bumper and wing for it!
That country we are flying to is Amsterdam? Hahah😂
battery problem
why you place the porsche logo at 14:09?
So MA dad's name is TONY, lad said it on this video
Matt's dad has a Heath Ledger's Joker kind of laugh lol
1:03 " The country we're flying to? Amsterdam...." No Mat, you flew to the capital of the Netherlands called Amsterdam. ;)
The man, the myth,  the Tony !!!!
Best break it,you should get your money back.
TONY
Yessssss
Lamborghini progress?
You've given mat's dad's name away so much in this video 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
From the second i saw the back of the car, i was yelling "walk away MAT, dont do it". guess you are a braver man then i am. Good lock with thisone
Dad’s name is Tony!!
part it out to Tavarish or DDE they may be able to make use of the parts, that carbon tub is the heart of the car and it has structural damage do you really want to risk your life on patched carbon.
always learn from dde's mistakes
"We need to see it in person" what did they see there that couldn't be photographed stay away from those c****
NO means NO big deal. This project will be even better. Mat will teach us all and show how to repair carbon fiber 😊😊😊
I knew that bloody Audi was too easy😂😂  You tempted Fate with the Rs6 and now karma wants payback! You'll think of something Mat🫤🫤🫤🤔🤔😂😂 I hope!❤
I got crash Honda for sale
Well having seen what is possible on Freddy Tavarish's 765LT as well as his P1, then this ought to be a breeze! Think you need to tap up some of his contacts, but at least they're mostly in the UK! Good luck, looking forward to seeing how this one goes! Hopefully you won't need an engine and gearbox rebuild like your Ferrari...
Looking forward to the full NDT report on that Tub if repaired. At the moment its about as road worthy as the Titan sub was sea worthy. ie death trap.
You can do it Matt. My money is on you.
NO RISK NO STORY!
Big up Tony
Matt's dad is called Tony??
Bro didn’t have to do max like dat
Shhhhhiiiiit Mat! You know how to take a risk! I'd be stripping for parts right now but I'm guessing you have other ideas!
I knew Freddy was a bad influence on you Mat, well at least the pyrofuse is much easier to get to than the Porsche. Good luck with the build, hopefully you can find someone willing to repair the tub.
At 5 mins in I would be astounded if this can be fixed
if anyone can get the car back on the road it's you Mat 👍 you got this 👌
Ginger
His name is tony? 🙊
Amsterdam is not a country
They said they had it running
You’re nuts!!
Good luck with that
Mat You can.
Mike essa is such a boss! Great you called DDE
Was I the only one that saw a Batman logo 😊
get the guy from usa
MAT YOU ARE ONE BRAVE MAN, SALUTE TO YOU FOR THAT. 💪
You have never been stopped before.  Trust in you and Tony can take on the challenge.
The ‘country’ we’re flying too…..‘Amsterdam’
I think the guy was bullshitting when he said they had it running, no way they had it running if you can’t get it to run and stay running.
Did you like it? In the Netherlands. I live there
His name is Tony!
TONY
I love to risk you take with this project and hopefully your able to fix this one and do your magic
@mat, I think you found  a dishonest Dutchman. How could they have had that car running and also checked the gearbox
max verstappen is half belgian ... beware ;-)
I wonder if they said "No" because it is not fixable, or because they just don't want to deal with it?  They may have said "No" just because the liability and they don't see a profit margin in it.
So hyped
Should have been stacked for parts supply. Very bad damage indeed.
I can’t wait for this one 🔥🔥🔥
I’ve seen a few of these repair / rebuild vlogs by various YouTubers now , I would not buy a McLaren at all
Tvarish has the McNugget, you have the MatClaren.  I’m sure a good boat builder grp specialist could fix it.
What a scumbag move by that company they could of easily said nah via email and say £100 but instead just chose to be awkward!
Amsterdam isn't a country mate 😂
Ask Tavarish's guy if he'd want to fly over and try to fix it! looking forward to this build!
IS THAT MICK ESSA FROM DDE?? OMG  (jk but we fr need a dde and matt Armstrong Collab)
its chewsday innit
As long as the chassis is okay……..
Sadly… I’m gonna say break for parts….you are in for at least a £60k repair… and it’s LHD import with bad title and the “Batman” badges sort of implies previous owner was a bit of a boy racer, so maintenance history also suspicious…
Damn mat finish the ferrari first
I don’t know if the solution will work for bypassing the brake system on a McLaren, but it does on a Hyundai. Without putting  youth foot on the break, push the push button start in one time  to accessory mode, after that, hold down the button for about 15 to 20 seconds and it should start.
My dad would hit me right in the face when he sees that I buy a crashed expensive car, your dad is just chill man😂
Subbed for the god videos and good luck with this one. I have a feeling you get it sorted! 😅
Been waiting for a Mclaren build from you Mat
Idk why these supercars. Very very few of your subs can. Stick to sub 80k cars
0:50 Amsterdam is not even a country 😅😂 This made me laugh so hard 😅   I'm so excited to see the final result 😊
LETS GOOO, this project is going to be sick 🔥🔥
MF says "need to see it person", looks at it for 3 seconds from 10 ft away and right away "no". Bruh
Respect for you guys, I wish I had the money, time and knowledge to do it myself to. Hopefully you manage to do it, you will, I know certain👍
Time to go visit Tavarish plug
bro about to flex on dde
Looking forward to this...
Let's go ❤💪🏾
I love your content, get that maclaren on the road!
Fingers croooooooossssssssssed you find some help for that carbon…..
So his names tony
Sounds like the car is flying to the states for carbon tub repair 💪🏼
How did the Dutch start the motor and run through the gearbox and test it all if it leaks oil as soon as you crank it?? Sounds like they were actually full of it bruv.
Ship it to the US and speak to @tavarish 😊😅😢
I've watched a load of these videos now and you've got a great approach to adversity Mat. Never do you cuss or let your head drop when things aren't going right and I'm sure that this will be the very best build ever. Keep going mate.
" and the country were flying to...Amsterdam" 😆
I love all your builds and you do amazing work but this is one I think maybe you should of left well alone. Just my opinion obviously. Good luck Mat, think you're gunna need it with this one 👍🏼
have you actually contacted McLaren? Worst case I'm there Saturday... :D
Ferrari videos please Matt
Freddie has a guy that does Tub repair. Vtuned would probably fix that up for you too. Pay extra and noone will ever know what you did lol. Good luck Mat
I wish I could visit the country Amsterdam one day
Time to pay for this build.  Release a new shirt I can buy . Like not everything is possible. Mclaren paperweight!
The McLaren rebuild race is on.  Tavarish has the has the head start, but Mat has his dad.  Game on. My money is on… Tavarish
They could have just answered "no" already in the email... 🧐
No guts, no glory. I wish you all the luck with the rebuild 🤞
Poor mat he looks heart broken
Ahhhh yes, the country of Amsterdam
Oh dear😊
Bodge it up yourself Mat, no permission needed then! But then I guess it couldn’t go back on the road?
your content is never going to get old! it makes my day every time i see another video come out!
Whenever mat has a new car you know he lost his mind even more
You know more than those “techs” at McLaren as well. You’ve proved that with the Ferrari gearbox. Don’t listen too them. 😂
Im alarmed at how many times Mat's dads name has been used in this video. Doesn't feel right.
Need to get that chris off your channel asap mate !
I hope you didn't actually pay half price for it!  Oh, you did :(  Might need to find a whole tub / donor car.
you came long way from riding a bike and repairing cars in front of your house , just wanted to give you some positive vibes !!! Been watching you since first video. keep it up mate !!! cheers from Croatia
This seems hard 😮 good luck 🤞
Are you sure Amsterdam is a country?
The country we are flying to? Amsterdam!😂
hahahahaha the country of Amsterdam
We finally know mat's dad's name. 😂
171k views in an hour is insane
Donor car with knackered engine and gearbox and bad interior maybe an ex track day car.....I wonder if your old mates have one going?
As Richard Hammond said:  Mat, you're insane 😮
You've got balls Matt but it's a thin line between adventure and stupidity 😱. Good luck 🤞🤞🤞
Tony😅 Right, there's a guy not far from you. . An absolute wizard with Carbon Fibre, specialising in MK1/2 Escort parts but will probably be up for a one off project.
First tavarish the dde on the channel love it
why nooo shouldn’t have done it, but hope everything falls thru to get it back together 🥲
„The country we’re flying to… Amsterdam!“ 😅 congrats on the new project Mr. Armstrong! Godspeed!
Man you are totally MENTAL to buy a car in this state !!! Good luck
Broo 😭🔥🔥🔥😭 he never disappoints
"I've made a mistake" 🙄
I live in Netherlands
Watching it while screaming: "DO NOT BUY THAT!!!!"
Tony is a hero 😂
they said they need to see it in person and then on just looking at it for a split second he knew it wasnt possible... and he couldnt see that from the fotos? ..... hmmmmmm...
MAT'S DAD NAME IS TONYYYYYYY...
Tony's such a legend
do it for mcskillet
I'd take engine out and stick It in a old mx5 rolling chassis , make a kit car
Best of luck with the new car ! I know you will fix it , I so much enjoy these videos. It's like watching car surgeons :-) honestly I think you can fix almost anything GLHF .
I would be trying to speak to some carbon experts maybe someone who repairs or manufactures High end carbon fishing poles , maybe someone like tricast in Rochdale that makes f1 parts
This car shouldn’t have sold for any more than what the engine is worth. I don’t feel 60 is cheap for this car in that condition.
finally a car that has its wheel on the correct side  also, damn.... even when its broken, its 2x, what i might be able to afford, if i cut some corners on food...
the country is called: Amsterdam hahahahah and then says the dutch menu is in german.. classic move..
Worth checking out AGN Composites or the Aerospace sector composite wing repair companies. From a quick google there are a few based in the UK. There are also a few F1 repair places in the Milton Keynes area.
👍👍👍
Amsterdam my favorite country Mat!
The country Amsterdam is known for its bad drivers
Well, if anyone would fix that, it's you, Matt. It does look very rough, but with the way you've been going, I think you'll manage it 🎉
Just buy a another tub
Good luck dude 👍🙏
New video here. Thank u🙏🏼
Mike Essa coming in clutch even in the Uk haha
reminds me of the Lamborghini Murcialago
The repairers could have told that from photos without seeing it in person . Surely mat could have sent pictures with all the measurements
Amsterdam isn’t a country
Hi Matt Check out   CARBON BIKE REPAIR UK. They repair carbon parts have a look at the repair of Porsche Gt4 on their YouTube channel. Good luck !
Amsterdam is not a country...like London is😂
Don’t you say the same thing with every crash damaged car you buy ? Also, if you are queueing up to board an Easyjet flight, don’t then show a totally different carrier’s wing tip !
MA Dad's name.
Schau mal in Deutschland vorbei
Glorious country of Amsterdam.
This 720s was not bought in Amsterdam or in Holland, but in Fryslan! Completely different country 😂
You made a mistake, really!!!🤨🤨🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭.  Send it back where it came from. 🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪. Nah, I know you can fix it mate. Just chill and carry on.
Here’s me thinking the Lambo was completely impossible!
Fredie has that carbon guy in the uk somewhere
V tuned has a tub for you
If anyone’s  gonna be able to do it it’s definitely you and your dad and team 🎉❤
You want to find a boat builder who specialises in carbon boats.  I’m sure you will have already looked into it or you wouldn’t have bought it 😉. Looking forward to this one!!  What a stable of cars you are going to end up with!  Going to need a shmee style garage soon!
MattClaren approved.
13:30 Did the cameraman call Matt’s dad “Tony”? Am I the only one hearing this??
dear mat, I have seen your videos, and I must emphasize, that beyond the fact that you do not have the knowledge or training of a BMW or Mercedes or Aston Martin technician, you have plenty of initiative and grit to be able to demonstrate that anyone with little (or much depending on the repair), and with some specific tools, you can repair exotic cars, you are also extremely casual and friendly, which makes you a person with incomparable innocence and humanity, I have seen the vast majority of your videos and I have learned a lot I send you a huge hug from Argentina, and I would like to meet you in person and be able to share with you at least one afternoon among all these cars that some only dream of having, congratulations on your channel and I look forward to seeing what you go to next repair, greetings....
Sell it for parts
Love the videos but i didnt know amsterdam is a country😂
Will be ok bro, is reparable!
Hi Matt Amsterdam isn’t a country
For gods sake. Don’t do it!
Noone compares to Matt anymore ❤🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
Amsterdam is NOT a country!!!!!
Mmmmm, be interesting to see how this goes as McLaren are famously lousy even to regular owners...
I havent watched yet but if you can fix it please centre the exhaust and put a chassis mounted wing on it, they look so good
I drive past that place daily
Holy cow this is just insane! That fucking car is so wrecked^^
😮”omg”…….this is going to be a good one..good luck Matt…but once it’s done…Booom 💥👌🏻🤞🏻
Can't wait to watch this when I'm back from football!
I would’ve offered them the opportunity to give me the car
Disgusting that bodyshop has to ask mclaren to fix it. Not their car anymore. Got to be someone thatll be able to fix it that doesnt have to ask permission.
HWBT…got faith I. You Matt you always find a way. 😊
This ting is insane ps i am waching for NL😮
Bro bought my dream car
Mclaren and destroyed A marriage made in heaven
Matt why dont you ship the monocoque shell to the states as it will be very light so may not cost a fortune to ship and get Freddie’s guy to repair your shell as well then ship it back it maybe the only solution as he did a amazing job on Freddie’s shell just a thought
What have you done 😂
Oh mathew what have you done this time. 😂😂😂
Did anyone ring McLean and speak to them like the seller advised you to ? and see if they did have it running ?
This is a crossover event in the car youtube cinematic universe
at this point you should have a stockpile of pyro fuses :v
love the porsche logo at the pyrofuse part
U can start by selling it to Tavarish or giving it back. U got urself a lemon right there. By the way, give a call to Mclaren Netherlands and check the story of the seller.
Mat: And the country we are flying to AMSTERDAM 💀💀💀💀💀
Wait…did someone just call your dad Tony? Is he called Tony??😮😅
Please go and repair it. Do not accept any NO from carbon “pro”. Wish You luck. Can’t wait new episodes
Every time i watch one of matt's builds, i think he has peaked it! then new one start and blows my mind again, and reaches new crazy levels. unbelievable! i love it!
Matt!? What were you thinking?
Every fecking video! Priceless entertainment!! 👊🏻
Half car, half price.
How can those boffins not tell from a picture if they could repair it ? Man was 6ft away and said no ......probably a good job you're not getting it repaired by them
Put the engine into a different shell of car and make a track sleeper
Camera man you said Tony's name too much in this video
Tony!!!
You guys have got this 🫶🏻
Fly Tavarish,s mate over and ask him if it’s doable
Amsterdam isn't a country
Soon as I seen this video. I thought of DDE.... I think u need mike on this build.😂😂
Firstly, I've never seen that kind of 'spiral' stairs leading to a plane. Secondly, Amsterdam is not really a country, but we'll let that one slip! 🙂
Why the heck they needed the car in person, if that was a fast 'nah' by just seeing the damaged part, couldn't they see on photos? or ask if it was that big what the technician showed with his hands? But good luck on the build I hope that I will see this amazing car brought back to life
You’ll find a way, you always do! Goooooo 💪
This is the first one I have looked at and instantly thought "No way". With that being said, where there is a will there is a way and if someone will pull this off, it will be you. Good luck and I will watch as keenly as I do all your other builds
Same demage as dde
If it’s not a mistake it’s not MA….. we have faith…get the paper mache out and carbon fibre transfers…
Finally😅😅
Give desty marine international a call,  they do carbon work  and paint etc all day every day  and the owner (neil) has a mclaren too!!! i almost guarantee they will take it on. i used to work for them but got ill with leukemia . proper multi million pound company that do a +++ carbon like you cant imagine goood luck
hahaha flashed the Porsche Logo 14:10
Videos are getting better Matt. Love the humour
Hanging out with Freddy = taking on insane projects
Where the oil is coming out. Tony at the engine😂😂😂😂
The country wee are flying too? Amsterdam ;-) LOL
TONY???
Fly VTUNE he rebuit one
i dont think this one is making it to sema
The car is way overpriced but I'm just a beginner and it's just my feeling and opinion. I'm curious if you continue to build on it. Love your channel.❤
You'll be able to fix it look at tavarish is one and dde how much they have done to there's strip it it will be worth it when it's done you mite not get much help from McLean   you don't need them
«The country we’re going to… AMSTERDAM» 😂😂😂
stop 🛑 stop wth the drama 😂😂MA .. never not seen you work solution out yet  😏😏😏😏😏👍🏻 you have spirits / 👁️💫 watching over U....😄😄😄😄😄😄
720 gogart !!
V tuned did the same, took him a year and cost as much as it would to have bought a straight one in the first place
It doesn’t look bad at all. Easy..
Mat leave it where it is 👎
Amsterdam is NOT a country mate
Do not trust car vertical guys, i bought a report for my car and it only showed quarter of the history which has not been worth it at all.
720s
Omg that crack 😢
The channel  vTuned garage fixed a 720 they got a replacement tub with some minor damage. you just gotta be lucky finding one.
Sorry but if it was me seeing that damage at the start I would of turned around and run
You've been hanging around with freddy too much 😂😂😂
Why do they keep calling Dad, "Tony"?
I must admit, apart from the carbon damage on the drivers side, it doesn’t look that bad. I’ve got 100% confidence you’ll find someone to repair it and then do your thing.
Why spend £750,000 (or whatever the insane repair costs total out to) repairing this car instead of buying a 2 new ones?
How many DDE fans are cringing right now 😂😂😂 good luck mate you're gonna need it!
sorry, but since when is Amsterdam a country?
Sorry but moste dutch guys are actually not trust wurthy 🤣 they bodge job cars moste of the time.if they done electrical work you are in for a good time 🤣
"The county I'm flying to...? 'Amsterdam!'"
The biggest project yet Matt. But you always pull something out the bag. Just some pointers that may help with the carbon situation. Probably been mentioned before but see if freddies carbon guy can fly out to examine and possibly repair. If not the put the feelers out globally for a replacement carbon tub as the metal subframe looks usable and can be moved across to another tub. The McLaren authorised repairers haave limitations by the looks of it so im sure another third party carbon specialist possibly in the aero or nautical industry may be able to do more. If all else fails and you cant get a refund then get yourself a welder, tube chassis the damaged sections and make this a track/ drift only car. good luck mate look forward to more on this one.
Best of luck!! Awesome content as always!
who will finish rebuilding their Mclaren first? Mat with his 720 S Freddie with his P1 DDE with the 720 GTR
Country we flying to, amsterdam. Bro, that is a city
Its crazy that he was first rebuilding a Audi tt on him driveway and now he is doing this
"damn" said amsterdam
Dont bother trying to fix it, just sell the parts and get your money back simple
Bro why would you bring it to the mclaren service center you know that they only gonna say no remember to dde they said to him no this can't be fixed they all tryna rip you off
Wheel mania can fix that wheel.  Nice one Tony.
Hi Mat, huge fan, been here since the m5 arrived at the garage, I love the stuff that you do, that you are a positive guy about almost everything, your humor, enthusiasm, and courage are amazing, much love from Serbia! hope you see this :D Wish you the best!
MSB leaked ittt 2 day ago 🤦🏽
Might have to ship it to tavarish to get the carbon fixed
So the seller lied about the engine considering all you had to do to start it and the oil leak. Anyway good luck looking forward to the build.
There is another YouTuber on here that has done tub work on a 720s Vtuned Garage. Hit him up he is very smart when it comes to these builds.
Jesus your nutty mat what are you going to do with it now.?? You could make it into a  mclaren simulator he he good luck with it anyway.
Funny to see u in the Netherlands!!    I follow u a long time already and I'm dutch
Who's Tony?
Where would Tony start? At the start 😅
You are a very brave
I can see already that there's serious structural damage to the monocoque chassis.  This would be one to avoid at all costs.  It's way worse than any McLaren rebuild we've seen yet.  But for 60K pounds it'll probably part out for more than that, which would be the smart way to go.  But there's no content in doing that, so the best way forward is probably to tear the car down to a stripped tub, send the tub to America for Freddy's friend to repair, and when it comes back, start rebuilding the car.   Or maybe you can find an equally good carbon fiber repairman in the UK.
Dude I’m not doubting your skills, and I’m sure you wouldn’t make content on it if you weren’t sure of what you’re doing, but from a glance that’s a massive undertaking bro. Kudos to you in advance man!
YOOO DDE THATS SO COOL. Glad you knew to go to them cuz i just watched the 720 series on their channel aswell
Collectively, we've all created insurance for supercars. If it weren't for these views, these content creators, there would be no $$ to rehab these smashed up supercars. This is actually quite cool, a literal industry created that did not exist 20 years ago.
10:56 What do you mean “Tony”… his name is not actually Matt’s Dad??? I need to sit down.
Vtuned built 1 of these
"the county we are flying is.... Amsterdam!" 😅😂
I’m sure you can fine a good repair and get this build going. Good luck and looking forward to seeing what happens next
😂 sell it payed 2 much matt😢
i got a new matt video for my birthday! thanks for the video lmao
diy it
It used to be, I've crashed my car, I'll call my insurance company.      Now its, I've crashed my car, I'll call Mat Armstrong to see if he wants to fix it!! 😂
720s monocoques are going for ~£35k on ebay ouch, and I'm pretty sure that will have its own vin number.....
Pyrofuse, Manufacturers place these in loads of different places quick flash from Porsche 😂
Your father's name is Tony.
yes agree Dutch people are good people
You can say no to a car! 😂
Love your videos man learn so much thinks when you build does super cars
Can you speak to the fella tavarish spoke too who sells all the carbon kits maybe he knows somebody ✌🏻
You've got love how honest the Dutch are. It's car dealers you have to watch out for!
New or salvage tub? If such a unicorn exists
We finally know mats dads name !!,
You both got Mclaren projects 720s and p1 cool
"The country we're flying to: Amsterdam!"   🤣🤣🤣🤣.
Frame doctor needs to fly to the UK to mix up a carbon smoothie
Amsterdam is not a country, lol
I was on pins just watching you start it up 😂
Mat and the Lamborghini? Hug from Portugal
The animal in the car is a "steenmarter" in dutch, and it is a protected animal. It eets trough hoses and wires in cars it is a common issue. I hope its not the case with your mclaren...
20:09 bro said NO before he showed him the damage
Honestly, flying over Tavarish's carbon guy might an option worth considering.
Mat! I recently saw your garage at Malory Park. I saw your green mercedes which is stunning in real life! Can't wait to see you finish a Mclaren.
Now we know what Mats fathers name is.
Mat looks at the broken side mirror and is wondering if the glass is alright :D Made my day!
I can’t quite believe you’ve paid £60k for that
Can’t wait to see this. Love the fact you have no fear it’s hilarious. Keep smashing it 🤛
dutch people tend to be trustworthy?! Here we say "if a dutch guy didn't scam you, it's because he forgot!"
Sell the parts you can and swap the engine and box into something else and make a mad one off car.
U Nutter 😂  This kinda thing take HUGE balls!! 👍
Blimey you guys love a challenge! Good luck!
What about the Lamborgini and also the Ferrari?? I'm still waiting to how the Lambo looks after the paint.
Amsterdam is not a country
Everyone is rebuilding a wrecked McLaren 😂. Love it
Cant wait for the next part bro
I just dont see its worth it
Smashed it out the park again Mat!
Luvely! Literally, why do they pronounce it wrong if the word LOVE have "O", not "U" in it?! Dat British...
well that's gonna suck won't it
Have a look at V Tuned Garage and look at there videos repairing their 720s
The game is up. The mystique  of Matts Dad is  broken.  100s of video where his name is said once and it's  dropped all over the place in this video. All hail the great Tony
Cross reference the parts. I bet they used a mk2 clio for the tub. Do the old swappero job done
sombody got tavarish envy .............. ^^ .
No nice move to let them bring the car. With that immediate 'no' surely they could have given their evaluation from the fotos alone.
Buy frame of other same car
It was like “Yeah YEAH” 😂 good luck with this build Mat! 👍🏼💯😂
Don't the doors have to be closed as well to start up
Out of any one I think your the best person for the job. U and your dad are unstoppable
Hope you can sort it mat,looks like a good project,wishing and crossing my finger for the best outcome, how much is a new body?
So we finnally know dad Armstrongs name😂
The country is NOT Amsterdam but Amsterdam is located in The Netherlands… c’mon guys…
I think you've been done over, if the place where you bought it from said its been running, but you had to do all that work to make it start it seems fishy. And in grand scheme of things if you cant repair it professionally then its not worth repairing at all.. you wont be able to take it on UK roads with a MOT either.
Hope this thing was under 10k
He thought we wouldn't see that Porsche logo we saw that mate and they saw that too
We love Tony & Hannah
It’s the MattClaren
Hey bro,are you still working on that e24 635CSI?.
Shame Mat,it's a money pit brother!Good luck with this one ,u gonna need it!Gonna b an epic journey, wishing u all the luck with parts etc!🙏🙏🙏🙏😬😬😬👊🦾
Mat gonna be the UK expert in CF in no time 😂❤
Goonsquad did  a worst carbon repair on there lamborghini it's possible
How’s the pyro fuse gone if no airbags have deployed
Just ordered some yfoods. Cany wait to try
I'm not sure why the "specialist" insisted on seeing the car in person before saying whether or not they could fix it, they could easily of just checked a picture and given you the same answer. Anyways good luck with the project guys.
Somebody selling a tub on eBay 35k
Our Tony loving that wheel
I am not complaining but you do know Amsterdam is not a country... right? :)))
Calls Tavarish, Flies over his repair man 💯
Waiting for you to state "it's really not that bad"  !
I wouldn't with ti's one dude
Matt, you're either a masochist or just a mad genius. Can't wait to see how this one goes. Good luck mate.
the country of amsterdam. hehe
Yes sir
You might have finally met your match
This is crazy!!  Love from 🇮🇳
Welcome to the Netherlands 👋🏻
Seems like they could have told you that over the phone…
Damaged carbon tub is a bad choice in my opinion but Matt can probably get it fixed 🤷🏽‍♂️
Oooooooooooooo Hannah said Matt's dad's name!! TONYYYYYYYYYYYYY
On no, the tub is F**ked…. Run, don’t walk away!
Keep your toes crossed guys
Foreshadow: You either disassemble the car and send the carbon tub to the USA for the frame doctor to fix it or you pay him to visit you in the UK and fix it there. (3rd choice you find someone in the UK thats equally talanted and willing to do it) Good luck.
FREEEEDDDDDYYY HEEEEELLLLPPPPPPP
Another great build, good luck and can’t wait!! You got this!!
Yesssss! I don’t care what it takes, I’m excited for this one. This is going to be a great project
dde probably got a shit ton of stock parts for ya
Amsterdam is a beautyfull country
Have a word with V Tuned he has done a 720 s complete tub change.
Its a Tavarish x Matt Amrstrong x DDE wrecked Mclaren extravaganza
Now we know why squirrels lose half of their nuts
"And the country we're flying to... Amsterdam"🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
How does Mat have the time for all of these projects is my question
'the country we we're flying to, Amsterdam' XD Amsterdam is the capital of the Netherlands not a country bro
All you need to do is find another one with front end damage...swap front end over...thank me later 🙈🤣
Have you bought your own recover truck? Makes sense to get one if not may as well get a crashed one 🤣
Another deathtrap that will be quickly fixed then raffled off
Wow. A brand new country called Amsterdam.
This will be the best build yet
I think you're best bet is to have tavarish hook you up with his guy.
Dammit, we can’t trust the Dutch either. Who can we trust… maybe the space aliens when they arrive😎
No mat you didn't make mistake
Strip it, Send the tub off to be repaired if possible then repair it from there? You have a lot of work ahead of you rip Mat
Wish you all the best!
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
In last case he can salvage the motor and some other parts and try to recover the money.
Matt, chillout 😂 guys moving MAD !
Stuff a bit of newspaper in it and filler over it😂 fixed!!!
I love the Porsche logo popping up about the pyro fuse 😂😂😂
Quite sus that you guys are not showing the full CarVertical report on the McLaren, it would seem as though it won't show as being damaged 👀, who knows.
TONY will fix that no problem!!
Quite frustrating that the carbon repair specialists told you that they would have to see it in person, when it was clearly obvious that from a photo they could have told you that the carbon wasn’t repairable 😢
Taking chances like this is how you make gains 👍🏼💪🏼
Pretty sure you can get a kit from halfords to repair this no problem.
Break it up and sell it in bits
Matt think youve bitten off to much this time when you look at what the DDE guys are doing to there 720 and that had way less than this one 🤞🤞 You could pop up to Sheffield as  McLaren have a factory that makes the tubs for there cars .
I’ve lost track now of which cars are still unfinished. What a great problem to have.
Will be class if you can sort that!! Matclaren 🤙🏽
Shout out to the legends DDE!
very interested in this build ready to follow along 👍
Install p1 body on 720s
he said.. the size of the damage they allowed to repair... he didn't say it's not repairable,
Mat is a mad man. Can't wait to watch this
“The country we’re flying to… Amsterdam” 💀💀💀💀💀  1:07
find a tub for it
Today I learned that Amsterdam is a country 😂
Never knew Amsterdam was a country …damn 😂
Mat u are the king and for sure you are going to fix that Mclaren
Hi
McLarens are so complicated for the sake of being complicated...I think you'll lose a lot of hair trying to re-build this one Matt. Good luck.
I am on Google Earth trying to find that country 'Amsterdam'.  Only joking good luck with the build.
Holy crap batman! At least you're still smiling Matt.
@vTuned
Country...Amsterdam?🤭
That looks proper thucked lol
Anything can be fixed!
Seen this at gravity
Finally 😂😂 Mat’s dad I know your name 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
next will be a McLaren P2?
Hi Mat. You can gei in touch with company "MBL" in Poland. They are spcialzed in repair carbon on cars or planes.
Result no number plate for a start 👍
Mat i wish  u see a video of the  ddde macrlean crashed car and u relate on the the repairs its going to cost us alot
Ouch that’s took a whack and a half!
Did the dashboard let you to change language to British or just English😎
Matt's dad's name....  tony.
I can vouch for the dutch being solid as, shout out to dutch science nutes!!
Oooh big project Matt. Wishing you all the best with it, and will look forward to checking in on it.
We have carbon specialists here in the uk! Work your magic and find someone that can do it no need to send it across the pond
they say no, but you can make it happen
😢good luck
There's got to be other specialists in the uk that does carbon fibre repairs that could repair it
That looks like a lot of expensive work, don't get me wrong, I'm happy to upgrade a turbo back full exhaust, intercooler and a downpipe but repairing carbon fibre, il stick to my day job. Good luck with this build.
He snuck a Porsche badge in there😭😭😭
Well maybe the frame doctor is interested in a trip to the UK?
I have a question, what about floor damage ? Isnt that unsafe in time ?
720 gtr? letss gooo...
Finally we’ll done mate
Cant wait to see how this one works out
tony lol
I kept hitting the time left button as I didn’t want the video to end. C’mon Matt and crew, you can rebuild this bad boy.
Best video 😂
Well let's put it this way mate, you wouldn't have embarked on this crusade if it wasn't financially viable. So all the best with this build Mat.
This is going to be epic
Id not be happy with that repair place. They said they have to see it and without even properly looking thay said no. Im no expert but that could have been done via email. They wasted your time there.
Whaaaaaaat.... Now this I have to seee
60k for this pile of garbage xD you sir deserve all the revenue this will give you with the videos repairing it.
Fly the carborn bloke over from America that Tavarish  used on the P1!
it's french not german hahaha
Tavarish knows a " guy " that can fix that......
hey really love ur work and definitely its fixable i do follow another youtuber who is from us he has fixed a wracked s720 he had replaced the entire tub his channel name vTuned garage hope his video may help u
Oh man, I felt gutted as soon as he said, 'Nah'.... what a harsh blow. I do hope you can somehow get this fixed! Hard work beats talent bro! ;)
Dont give up.
"the country we fly to, Amsterdam"  Amsterdam is not a country issit?
NGL saw this car at Gravity and knew what it was before you revealed it because the break calipers were sowing :D Can't wait for this project!
the only person that can fix it is you, im not convinced with the carbon repair as all it is , is plugging a hole and carbon needs to be interwoven to assure strength. its not fibreglass . sure someone will explain it in more depth but mclaren wouldn't just patch it up
I’m dutch :)🇳🇱
Bro, That is some next level risk😂😂😂
Brave man Matt. But I have confidence you will pull it off.
Your dad’s name is Tony? Or is that someone else in the crew?
U nutta
Thought it was the light blue one i got out bid on copart for a monent 😅😂
Mate, time to change your channel name to Tabritish in honour of Tavarish.
Could the leak be from the mechatronics unit? I had a similar problem on my car a few years ago.
here we go again boyssss!!!
LEVELS  You’ve been spending too much time with Tavarish, Mat.  Looking forward to the content on this one. Maybe fly out Freddy’s guy who worked on the P1?!
Nederland! 🇳🇱🎉
Trade the motor with @richrebuilds
There is nothing gaffa tape can't fix. 😂     You will fix this Mat. You thought the same about the BMW , Porsche and other cars. You can do it.
i llike how a lot of your "I bought this and that car, but i think i made a mistake" begin that way but end up as beautifully rebuilt cars. Keep up the good work my man, the Audi RS6 looks beautiful too!
This gonna be the best repair of all... wont miss even a single episode!
Hi Mat, I work at MCTC Sheffield, building tubs for McLaren and unfortunately, that kind of damage is unreparable to my knowledge 😢
1:04 Amsterdam isn't a country
Oooo may have bitten off more than you can chew here. Hope not tho 👍🏼
Can't wait for this series
At least the steering wheel is on the right side😎
Nice heap Matt 🎉🎉😂
Matt your videos are so contagious. I love your passion and willingness to try new things. But I have to say Amsterdam is not a countreh. The accent does make you more endearing!
What if u bought a flood damaged 720s ?
Even with a lot of imagination, I find it difficult to believe that you would buy such a car without having started it locally first, sorry
The country I’m flying to AMSTERDAM
I think I know Mat's father's name! Tony, is it?
Looks like the perfect time to re-shell a McLaren
Mat you’re videos should be longer
Speak to the dde guys theirs wasn't as damaged as that and they had to do a fair amount to get it to where that is now
Sure I heard your dad's name 😮
I dislike the front lamps of this mclaren type. I think that you will never fix this car, because you will not get the parts you need for this.
WHERE TO BUY WRECKED CARS????
This gunna be the best series so far
DDE has hell to get the suspension issues
Matt 'not right in the head' Armstrong. 😂😂
"The country we went to: Amsterdam!" As a Dutchman, I can say you are not wrong 😂😂 Amsterdam considers itself a lone republic within the Netherlands...
What’s the price of a chassis ?🤔
How much cars u have
Don't do it you are going to lose your money
Thought he was on phone to freddie.   Sweet seeing dde
Excited to see how this one works out!! Matt’s Dad will figure it out …
Twijzel🤩
bomboclat
Amsterdam is not a country but a city in Holland
You Should Have Spoken With Freddy Tavarish First
I can repair that tub for you. It wouldn't take much but you would need t strip it all down first.
Cut out the broken and remold new custom pieces, build some carbon rolled pegs to edge it in like wood peg connectors. And make sure your top and bottom patch match the thickness. You got this Matt
Looking forward to this build Matt 👍
The country you were flying to was the Netherlands and the city is Amsterdam.
I think it was DDE that said the discs are special order from Mclaren & either 1 year or 2 years. But will be a cool build. But don't up the power without an engine build, Mclaren don't use the strongest rods
Look at all those red flags! I'll take it 😅
My instant reaction was, no way. But you might work some miracle :P
You could just get a new one
Looks like a new tub .... ebay £35k
Run Forrest run, I am six minutes in its not looking good. Find yourself a nice Mondeo to fix up lol
Max Max super Max
Good luck.
Replacement tub??
14:20 😂😂😂the Porsche logo flash
Love that you made a quick call to DDE, so cool. Cannot wait for this build, please do 2 vids a week, I cannot get enough of these vids 🙌
yes, the Amsterdam country
Slap a bit of fibre glass on it matt, it will be ok lol.
Strip it and put the engine and gearbox in something else.. make an insane drift car or something out of an old retro car.. 🤷🏻‍♂️
The fucking pyro fuse 🧨 😂😂😂😂
Check out vtuned Ben swapped out the whole tub on his 720s
The country we're flying to... Amsterdam... 😂
No mistakes here , its just going to be an amazing series for us viewers !! KEEP IT COMING MAT
Great ❤
Matt's dad name : Tony
Theres an old man in Europe who is the master off any crash damaged cars like in their millions ,  russian albainian german , ARTHUT TUSICK ,I think thats his name ,He is Amazing .
TONY!!!
Can definitely be repaired, the only reason they wouldn't do it is because McLaren say they cant but anyone without a link to McLaren wouldbe able to do it
Have fun!!!
Nah 😆😆💪
why this guy always buying broken cars and repairing them poor
Mat .Mokum (Amsterdam called by born locals)is a city not a country😅
They would say it cannot be fixed.  it can be
oh lol i might actually know where this car is sitting LOL. that town looks familiar.
Even if you can... how would it pass an MOT without a manufacturer approved repair?
I sincerely wish you good luck. But I don't know if you didn't make a mistake
I love it, best car on this channel 😍 hope you can fix it
So let me see if I understood right 🤭🤭 the mclaren has a LGBT oil leak? TRANSmission leak 😂😂😂😅
£35k for a replacement tub… gonna be cutting it tight with this build to bring it out below budget! I’ve got all faith in you ;)
What about ferrari video? 😢
Sneak dissing Porsche😂
Manufacturers like to put the pyro fuse in loads of different places - flash the Porsche logo quickly 😂😂
Thats not even a mclaren anymore Its a laren 🤣💪
Cool video , I really like your content , because it is very interesting and uncomon....
It’s the best car to rebuilt, you don’t need to worry about panel gaps
We’ll just ask Freddy for help lol
Kiwi black shoe polish will surely polish her out like new.  Another epic Matt and dad build. Cant wait.  Well done.
Get tavarish carbon doctor from his country and fly him over to your country to repair the damage to the tub.
the best channel you could watch on youtube!! I love what you do and you can do it best of luck
Just put some Bondo on it.  The rest will just buff out.
This McLaren builds going to be interesting…. Prob going to be a 5month wait on an engine gasket let alone some of the structural parts. 🫣😱
I will be impressed if you can pull this one off. This might be worse than tavarish's mclaren.
I love his dad's laugh (16:52)..it's just so contagious
Fly the bicycle guy over. Let him fix it, or see if he knows someone on your side of the pond
You just inspired me to o buy a Corsa  lite B and start breaking stuff up however I am working on a zero budget but I am determined to succeed. Dude from South Africa
nah...... lol :D good luck
If you want to burn yourself like a mutha fuga with parts prices… buy a McLaren!!
It can always be repaired but at what cost I've repaired vehicle for companies that cost a lot more to repair than they were worth and a couple that cost more than a new vehicle I've no idea why they weren't written off i wasn't involved in that bit i just repaired them i didn't care i was getting paid and kept me busy for many months at a time 😂
Im dutch and i can tell you, alot of dutch car vendors are far from honest about what they sell😅
Flashing the Porsche logo for the hidden fuse lol - that was hilarious!
"The country that we are flying to... Amsterdam" 🤔
your crazy but thats why we love you
you're a legend for taking the risk Mat!
Mat: "is the glass ok?"  Worried that the sideview mirror might need new glass!  Haha!
Thinks a few calls to tavarish mite be needed on this one 😂😂
Your dad 😂😂😂😂👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I'm already impressed with you and what you do Matt, but pull this one off you'll be the YouTube god as far as I am concerned 😊
You can do it just get another McLaren you’ve got the part car
The country we are flying to.. Amsterdam..
Pink slips with DDE but with a twist   First one to complete the build gets the losers unfinished one 😂
I think @Tavarish knows a carbon fibre man or three? 😉 How much is a airline ticket from the US and a boat load of carbon fibre? 😁
I dont get the car vertical advert mat your basically saying dont buy a car from the likes  of your self
Just new paint and you're sorted.....You can do this one as well..
Like you said, get the engine and running gear sold, scrap the body or auction it. Gearbox alone is worth a mint./
Let the challenge commence 🙏🏾
"the country we are flying to, Amsterdam". this gives England is my city vibes
Time to fly the carbon doctor in
Tavarish will be your brother 4 a long time🤣🤣🤣
Thank you for the compliment of the Dutch people 💪🏻
Watch the DDE mclaren 720 gtr videos they show reasons bits won’t work and why!
It might be cheaper to fly that carbon guy who repaired Tavarish P1 Tub over to fix it👍
I'd have thought Matt would travel with a pyro fuse in his pocket these days!
Bit of gorilla tape all will be fine
“All we’ve got to do is repair everything else” Lol Love the work mate. Keep it coming
£60k seems crazy for a car in that condition, mclaren or not
Vtuned YouTube channel built one of these
As soon as I saw the digital dash trying to come out I instantly thought of DDE 😂
*laughs in financial mistake*
love the little Porsche joke about the pyro fuse lol
DO THE VIVID RACING KIT!
Just fly Tavarish guy out to you and get him to fix it. Exposure for him some more and fixed car. Guarantee that's what will happen.
MATT HAS BEEN INSPIRED BY TAVARISH  :D
Parts City Ltd in Stourbridge. They have a tub for sale @ £35,000
Nice car. As you are not using an autoclave then it's like repairing fibre glass with layers of carbon and resin and the picture you showed where you have a step around it will key it together. The tub will be so strong that's not enough damage to concerned about in my opinion.
Seen this inside gravity car show next to your stand thought it might be the next instalment car wait to see how u get on with it 👌🔥also how did mclaren start it and say engine and gearbox was fine if as you guys found out it wouldn’t start and fluid was leaking etc ?
Every time I say nope! Every time I have been proved wrong. Not gonna say it this time. Please let me get one right.
No you didn’t.. You know what you are doing!😄
I have never seen a car brought on this channel then turns out can’t be fixed😂🤷‍♂️this channel builds always start like this, just give Mat 3 months and it’s mental😂🔥🔥🔥
Looks like you'll have to fly Freddie's mate out for a week or two to repair that in your unit! 😂
Super invested into this one, can’t wait for the next update
It'll all work out
This was interesting. Good luck with the build
Why not do a Panotara build with the engine and box
Wherr is lambo?
He who dares wins
Dont do it, dont do it, dont do it....oooo.  😭
I've bought a TT as a bit of a play thing while my C63s has some engine work done so I'm viewing your original TT vids and to go from that to a 720 is mental!! A clear testiment to your positive attitude, growing set of skills and just getting in their and making it happen! Like all your cars, I'll watch and see you succeed!
Oh my life what a project hope it can be fixed, or maybe it would’ve been better to leave it there time will tell🤔
that's the best dutch English accent I've ever heard!
The country was amsterdam? Its the netherlands😂
That Sly dig at where Porsche put their Pyro Fuse for the GT3 RS
Looking forward to see this amazing build
its just a mclaren. Makes sense 😂😂😂
Mat has been to Amsterdam and been smoking Amsterdams finest with this one 😂. This is the craziest looking project yet!
Why don’t you do repair some cheaper cars, cars what your viewers can afford
16:51 instant meme, love your Dad!
Look so sick  Thanks mat for getting risks for us
I’m thinking wide body, air ride suspension, carbon fibre everywhere and a wing bigger than a jumbo jet!!!!
Yes mat 🎉!! Looking forward to this one! And is that your own sprinter recovery truck?
NETHERLANDS! also love your videos mat i also hoop you will be able to sell in other countrys as well if you are going to sell it
You can do it! Yeah! 🎉
Can you fly Freddy’s guy to the UK to do the repair?
send the tub off to @tavarish , only option unless a specialist carbon repairer wants to take it on , good luck cant wait to be able to see the journey
Rub-a-Dub-Dub looks like you need a new tub! lol good luck with the 720!
Shits crazy
“The country we are flying too…. Amsterdam”😭
I am a big fan Mat - but what are you wearing on your red t-shirt !!!
Please do a gtr R35 nismo next❤️
Wonder how much a blank tub ans a new door
The country we're flying to, Amsterdam! 1:04
The country of Amsterdam lol? 😂
So how much is a new tub?
Nice, welcome to my home country!
You must be mad, I don’t know what you’re going to take on after this but it’s going to be hard to top. I am very much looking forward to this one 😬
Im dutch 😂
You act like you're not friends with Tavarish and his story hahahah
this build is  defently gonne be fire
I just saw Mat Watson face on Mat Armstrong's channel❤️ amazing
Mate! That's not even a 720s anymore. That's just s smashed. 💀
If nothing,  else you have a front end for a simulator 😅
Who finishes the Maclaren build first? Matt or Tavares? My mulas on Matt 😊who you got?????
14:09 Posrche has to pay 🥲🤧
love the 720
Take it to America, get the guy who fixed tavarish's carbon to fix this, you can then sell it there in a left hand drive market?
How annoying, they could of easily said no from pictures if it took them all of 2 seconds to tell you
Less than half the price for half the car! Bargain! 😅
Bro gonna go broke
I love this channel
This is going to be a interesting journey 😅
I know your dad's name😂 now
Mat you have a left hand drive 720S which is worth a lot more in Europe than a right hand drive car. LHD is worth 200k euros! So you have more budget for the repairs!
Someone says no to Mat, we know that we say YEAHHHHH 😅 LETS GOOOOO
I don't want to try and predict the future of this build. However, looking into my crystal ball, I see first class airline tickets from Florida to East Midlands for Freddie's carbon guy. 😊
Matt Uve done worse I know  ask tavarish if not  ask about for a new new tub but that isn't going to be cheep I'm sure I've seen another vid ov a crashed mclaran and there freind had a spare tub
So we’re all going to pretend like we didn’t know a McLaren authorized shop wasn’t going to touch that, and that Matt only bought it hoping they would after the old “Need to see it in person” line, when it was obvious even with a pic that it was bad, and that he doesn’t have a real plan with an actual carbon fibre specialist? 😂 ok ok a little dramatic, but still love ya. Just try to keep it real will ya 😂.
I really think this might be a horrible idea, so how did mclaren test it if the pyro fuse is blown? Im sure you have to reset the crash sensor also.. that would cut the fuel off to the car.. so yea i think the guy whos selling it is full of shit
I MADE A BIG MISTAKE  10 EPs LATER.....
he always makes mistakes it doesnt even show up on his card its change on  his  bill .DEAN just gets on with it  and rob and chris .
LET'S WELCOME NEW SUBCRIBERS!
TONY!!!
That "Dutch people" comment was insane 😂😂
ohh snapp i cant wait for this build i hope the engine is good and dont break the bank on you good luck man
Why.....just why.
Get the guy from the States that did Tavarish's car to come over. YouTube Gold. If Mclaren had an ounce of sense they would get behind you on this for the PR,. Looking forward to it, you'll smash it.
Fly in @tavarish ‘s carbon guy. He’s clearly not afraid!
Tonyyy!
Amsterdam isn't a country bro 😂
If Matt and his dad are working on a car together it’s going to get fixed, there is no challenge too big for these two
Nutter!  It will be awesome.
Start at buying a new tub mat.
Nice! I always thought the McLaren 720 was one of those cars you buy to keep forever
Love these vide9s and im learning a shit load about fixing certain cars
I saw this at gravity and got some pics of it. Can’t wait to see it be rebuilt!!
I believe you have some friends here in the US that are just crazy enough to take the journey with you
Can you Imagine 'you can't check the oil" whyyyy 😢
Wait wait wait @08:21 am I the only one who just discovered Matt's Dad's name????
Setiously just fly out tavarish carbon fibre guy to fix it.. id bet he would do it if he can get all the stuff there to fix it..
Amsterdam the "Country"
Mike esta legend
Since when is Amsterdam a country?
Need a 720 GTR body kit for it
SEND IT TO THE STATES AND GET ER FIXED
What country was it? 🙈
I have been waiting for your next video
My mate in Leicester might have some left over parts for his 720s build. He repaired and resprayed it at a McLaren approved garage in Surrey, they maybe able to help. 🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️
I would take the car apart. Check the transmission, check the engine, if those are good you can make good money out of them. Call Tavarish and have his guy come to London. That is going to be a few bucks but could be a way to go. I wish you all the best in this project. I think it still interesting.
Another great video well done Matt good luck with this build 💯
You're an absolute nutter, I can't wait to see this story unfold 🫡
Now I know what your dad’s name is Mat is it Tony
Jeez matt cant ya do some more sensable cars then raffle em off .. this cars too bad in another country and left hand drive.. i woulda walked away. Enjoy the cafe's
I was hoping you did a Mclaren hoot hoot
I am so curious about this build this is my absolute dreamcar!
Holy shit Matt you’ve got balls of granite to even consider doing this one 😬😬😬😬😬😬
Since when is Amsterdam a country? Just wondering
The frame doctor is getting a free trip to the uk.😂😂
Get the guy over from the states 😊
And we all know how finicky these motors are and this thing took a shot right in the side of where the motor is.. I will eat my shoe if there isn't massive damage to the motor from the wreck, I think once you get into it you will find ears broken off all kinds of things twisted, I've seen alot less damage and the motor is all tweaked. I'll be extremely surprised if there isn't very big damage under neath all this. And what If there us damage to the carbon tub? Do you know someone that can repair it? If there is call tavarish he knows a guy who can fix it. But if it wasent a McLaren and it had the same hit I would be more confident about the car....
Mat I’ve got my fingers crossed on this one. I have faith in you but not in Mclaren.
Finally McLaren!! Wish you all the luck bro ✌🏻
my dream car♟️🚨📈
Ducht people trust worthy 😂😂😂😂 broer is helemaal gek
Need to set up a body shop matt
Delete that stupid batmobile pin striping
As soon as I saw the 720s in the thumbnail I thought “yessss” this is gonna be epic
He gotta make at least 10 videos for this cause that looks like it's gonna take a while to fix
And they have crappy engines and are abysmal to fix.
New tub ?
So stoked to see the rebuild on this car. Best of luck!
Pls upgrade the pistons and rods, the rods and piston and crankshafts on these McLaren engines are extremely fragile, even when you tune it a 60 HP increase your gonna get a hole in the engine.
I feel like the "specialists" could have said they would only repair a small area before you having to buy it and ship it there for assessment. 🙈
Amsterdam is a country now?
Get a 2nd opinion, those guys seemed like bellends.
how about swapping engin to another car like to your ferrari ? :D or another car that would be def. interesting.
Been waiting for this since seeing it at the NEC along with yourself! Looking forward to this rebuild👌
❤❤❤❤❤
Fix everything else ship it over too Florida and have Freddy’s guy repair it, then sell it there it’s LHD anyways 😂
That tub damage is something else but it still doesn't look worse than tavarish 675 LT looking forward to the progress
We all saw the porsche logo flash 🤣
How did it run at McLaren if the pyro was blown?  And they tested the gear box but it has a major leak?? Seems fishy to me
Scrap it for parts and get 20k profit of that shit
Cannot wait for this build
This build is going to be epic 🔥
"The country we're flying to: Amsterdam "😂😂😂 England is my city💯
What have you put yourself in to now 🙆🙆
4:10 banananana
Let's go!!!🎉
Talk about stepping up big time  Best of luck Matt 👌
GOOD LUCK MATT you´re gonna need it!
Amsterdam is NOT A COUNTRY
You should had seen my face when I saw Matt Watson 😊 Nice video good luck love the content❤
Fair play calling the GOAT Mike Essa!!  Gutted the garage couldn’t have told you about the size they’d repair before you bought it!
16:45 did you press the start button more than once and that's why it tried to start more than once afterwards? just took a while for the computer to catch up?
I love this build it’s gonna be awesome
Looking forward to this build.
Looking forward to you proving them wrong! £5k seems bloody optimistic mind you! 😄😄😄
Should have bought a yellow one which went for a little swim around the flooded car park ..... cheaper to repair  !!   .🚖
bro Amsterdam is not a country haha
Did anyone catch Matt's dad's name? Hahaha
The country we're flying to... Amsterdam 😅
Mat, you’re going to need a garage like Freddie with all the projects you’ve got. Excited to watch this one along with the Ferrari and Lambo
Mad Mat strikes again 😂😂
We all know whatever happens, if that engine runs and you cant repair the car, there’ll be a transplant happening 🤭
Ive watched your videos for awhile but i think this was a bridge too far. Good luck, ill be watching
You always being positive 😎
The country we are flying to... Amsterdam😁
Maybe take it to the usa here lol we can fix it we don't care what mcclarin thinks
Matt , is there any chance that you can get the guy who repaired the tub on Tavarish's Mclaren to fly to the UK to repair yours ??
Good Luck i live in the Netherlands it is buitefol
the impact damage to the tub carbon may have transferred to other areas of the tub, dissipating the impact but damaging areas you cant see
Unreal Matt, one of my dream cars. Looking forward to seeing this series!
how do you find mclaren parts
Endless money pit.
To be absolutely honest with you I have 100% faith however bro, I think you really needed to fix and flip that rarri before another project
6:00 You all got a laugh out of this ;-)
Anything can be repaired matt just depends on price main dealers just don't want to know but good look matey from James
Fingers crossed for you Mat 🤞🏻
50% price off? I would not even pay 25%
is your dads name Tony?
Mat's dads name is Tony!
Probably not going to see a lot of videos with the McLaren,I mean just ask tavarish haven't seen a video from him in a month,he has just been making cameos and posting jacks builds.. good luck mat I know you got it in ya ..
it will be a great adventure.  I envy you this.
Never buy any vehicle that has lots of damage where the engine sits. Moral of the story the Dutch lied to you. There is no climactic moment where the technician was going to come out and say it's all good. This is what they are trained to say.....no.
The country you bought the car in. It’s the Netherlands. Not Amsterdam
More awesome content!
Here we go again! Excited to watch the process of this new project 😁😊
Love it! But how the hell do you sleep?
Swap the engine into a volvo why not😂
Mat: I made a mistake.  Freddy: Hold my sea water.  Also, Amsterdam isn't a country. 👍
DDE
So the dirty Dutch lied. They didn’t run it for a long time
I love how you always stay positive matt i would be freaking out
Your balls are massive to take this on, looking forward to seeing the following videos on the progress...  Who knows what will happen, Batman has his fingers crossed 🤞!!
Err Amsterdam isn't a country lol
Abit of filler and a wash and it’ll be good to go 😂😂 Good luck Matt.  You got this!
Is the Porsche staying in the us or is it coming over?
good luck with that😅
The is gonna be a wicked build, can’t wait to see the rest in the series 🤞
The country we are flying to.... Amsterdam, you kidding me 😂
The country we’re flying to is Amsterdam? Amsterdam is a city Matt😉
bro i love ur videos, i always watch them after school and here i am again, i have watched ur vids for like 4 hours straight😂 i wanna see how far u get with this mclaren
Where there’s a will there’s a way.      Hopefully 😂😂
My town
I really like how supportive the Youtube car community is.
Amazing car, and from the brand new country of Amsterdam 😂  Looks like a sick project dude, good luck, can't wait to see it progress.
Probably a married squirrel
Mat Armstrong is simply BOSS!!!
did she just say that the dads name is Tony??
Don't give up yet, Mat.  F%$k them so called specialist.  This will be one hell of a build if you can pull it off. You and your team is more than capable to get this done.  "If you build it...they will come"  LOL  GOODLUCK!
Hehe the country of Amsterdam xD
@vtuned changed the Tub
When is the Ferrari update video coming? Super pumped for the final results!
You're a nutter Matt love you bud😂Fix that thang!
Whenever Mat makes a “big mistake”, you know it’s gonna be a great build.
Hey Mat, What's new with LaFerrari? 😅
Oh, hello Tony!
At least it isn't covered in sand and dripping in salty water 😅 looking forward to seeing this one done 👍
any chance you can do several episodes and also get them out daily, now what am I supposed to do until I find out how your going to fix it ?? we need more videos and we want them now. 😂
As a last resort you could Ask the frame doctor if he would like a free holiday in the uk and of course pay him. I guess it would not hurt to email him some photos as well. Good luck I’m sure you can fix it.
i am so excited for this one
You can do it Mat!! Only you can do it and change the handle to the right hand side!!
fiberglass it is then 😅
Would have said 30k max haha
I used to work with composites, fiberglass, carbon (all different kinds) and the biggest pain in the ass material (to sand and get right) Dyneema. Before anyone says u can’t sand Dyneema, I know that but u can burn it to sand it if you know what you’re doing. Seeing the carbon damage, yeah it’s a lot of work to get right and fix and maybe McLaren wouldn’t do it but it is definitely possible to repair or replace and get the broken parts even stronger than before using the right technique and right materials.  Good luck with it Matt you’ll work it out 👍👍👍💪💪💪💪💪💪
It never ends and I’m here for it!!! Car after car this is sickkkkk
This one is gunna be a nail biter😬 good luck 🤞🏻🤞🏻
Check the video for a subliminal Porsche badge as he looks for the pyro fuse.
Don’t give up can’t wait for this to get started
Looks exactly like DDEs 720Ss did. Except theirs wasn't tub damage.
You can still fix it my man.
Dude, transplant the engine into something else 🤪
I have OEM used parts for my Mclaren I can give it away with cheap price. Full rear bumper and diffuser , and many other parts including exhaust and douwn pipe.
Damage Looks like DDE 720.
From an Audi TT to a McLaren. BLOODY GET IN THERE LAAAD.
Great to see Matt Watson in the video ❤
Where the oil come from His dad - “engine hahahaha”  He’s hilarious
worse purchase ever sell it right away good luck getting parts there extremely expensive and hard to find  youll go broke rebuilding it
You have to get Mclaren permission to buy it whats it got to do with them 😮
If they cant you can, you've learnt so much, and now its the time to show its possible uwu
i've never heard a funnier and sadder "nah" in my whole life 😭
I thought we couldnt use dads name!!!
Might need to fly the frame doctor out to England
I'm so invested in this build, love mclaren no matter the problems they have
i wont be surprised if you in like couple years you will be rebuilding a bugatti
Find a tub and swap what you can .
Country of Amsterdam?
If you manage to rebuild this beast you’ll be forever know an a Mclaren Specialist 😂
You are bonkers Mat. And we love it. 😂😂😂😂
Noice
10/10 video
Madness 1 step beyond 😂
Well why didn’t the guy say they’re only allowed to repair a small area in the first place, guys a waffler
I know @tavarish has someone that can sort that tub
Matt, you should check VTuned’s 720s build he replaced the tub on his 720s
What would Freddy do?😊
Yes🎉
Dads name is Tony whoop whoop
Looks like the frame Dr will be taking a busman's holiday to Worcestershire.
Dutch is not Germany brotha 😂❤
Mat! Your dad's name is Tony?
He'll have a hard time fixing the suspension 💀💀
Mat took this to Gravity where people have said its absolutely battered... if you manage to fix this I will be amazed beyond belief
I swear this mfer is gonna run out of money if he keeps going like this lol
Matt’s brain is damaged 😂😂
Im sure you will find a way mat,its going to be good watching this one! Good luck!
WOAHHHHH NEVER EXPECTED THIS
I’ve got faith in this build, go rogue and show mclaren you can bring cars back from the grave and blast them into orbit 🚀
Mat .....you gotta find away to go with this , the journey will be epic , kudos to you for trying this ! Think your dad's face said it all at the end 🤣🤣 great vid
Get some cable ties on it, it'll be reet
You are crazy! I love it!!!
MCLAREN WONT FIX.... Ofcourse they would fix whatever. If someone wants to pay for it. If the insurance decides its not worth it, then its not worth it. And then they will sell it for scraps to cover their losses.
There was a lot of talking about your Porsche gt3 ,that it would cost a lot of money to register it in UK. Wouldn’t it be the same story with the Mclaren once it’s fixed ?
You're amazing, love this channel❤. Cheers from the Netherlands!
holy shit a 720s CANT WAIT FOR THIS ONE !!!!!!!
Big shout out to dde
That Porsche logo flash when talking about the pyro fuse made me laugh 😂
For strange reason i feal that i want to pay you for this project😂
Ahh yes the country of amsterdam.. I know its a mistake but its always kinda of funny seeing people call the Netherlands Amsterdam or holland
wait did we just get to know mat's dad's name? His girlfriend called him Tony I am pretty sure
If the tub cant be repaired then parting the car out will likely make your money back. Best of luck. You guys are awesome!
tavarish made a bigger mistake than you . you should be proud that you join the mclaren familly
Vtuned is the guy for the job❤
Matt..... you fool😂😂😂😂😂😂
Buy a new carbon shell, buy the parts you need and add the parts you can reuse from this one  ……. Lol 😂  Love it. You’ll get your £60k+ back from YouTube Matt. We’re all rooting for you. 🙏🏼
Headache gear thst. Good luck 👍 😅
DDE❤❤ Mike Essa in the house!!
is this the car that u did a show it in  the Lamborghini Huracan video ( last clip )
Mat, i dare you to go a full project without buying another
This would be an awful decision..... apart from having 1.7 million subscribers which then makes it viable financially.
Is this gonna be a give away in the Netherlands😍
In a couple of years, mat and the crew will get a bucket of dust, run a carvertical on it, then built a laferrari out if it.
Well…..you can always part it out and get your money back…..probably…
Strip the car so you know the true extent of the damage. Chop out the damaged area, make a mould out of it and fabricate a new section. I know I’m simplifying it but there will be a way of fixing it even if it means having the frame doctor fly over and help.
Was your dad name “tony” if I’m right ❤
TONY!!!! I’m Ezekiel! 😂LOL
i pray it can be fixed !!
In Tony We Trust !!
TONY!!!!!
Mat saw Freddy's McLaren flavored financial L and said, "Yeah, I'll have what he's having!"
Love the vids so much!!! Just wish they were longer 😢😂😂
Gotta love the country of Amsterdam
This is gonna be one of the best rebuilds in my opinion if it’s possible to repair the monocoque
The boys at DDE will help you get this fixed. they're repairing there own now anyways lol. Almost done
Bro spends a couple months with tavarish and thinks he’s a McLaren genius. Seriously tho gonna be a sick build and if anyone can do it u can
His dads name is Tony!
Matt, surely the carbon guy in the states is the best to ask, he’s fixed massive areas on Tavarish’s P1…. Btw your mad 😂 Good luck on this mega build 👍🏻
Now we know ur dad's name Tony❤❤
Ask him for the bottom price they will go to' as you look like walking away from the deal
Babe wake up, mat just posted a video
Always pushing the limit🚀 Looking forward to this challenge🔥🔥🔥 Ps it would be a nice time to add mainland EU to the raffle❤
1:05 the country we are flying to: Amsterdam. Great job matt😂
Makes me wonder how the Dutch garage tested the engine and gearbox? Good luck!!
So… Tony is your dads name!
Hey mat ,hope u doing well I know this McLaren is going to turn good but I've been wanting to see you rebuilding a jeep trackhawk plizzzz 😊😊
Erm is a new tub a possibility????
it's a parts car 100%....i hate when youtuber make stupid videos and projects like that, just for the views 🤦🏻‍♂
Mad but going to be great for content
this is gonna be epic
21:03 😂😂😂😂😂
Send it abroad for repair
This is going to be a great build to add to the saga, best videos to watch on YouTube making me want to build cars
Take it to the US abd see if you cant get it fixed with Tavarish guy😂
Всем привет из Москвы! Отличный проект, ждём продолжения
This concerns me!
your going to have to take some notes from DDE repairing their modified 720s. just the suspension getting recharged was a pain in the ass for them.
So his name is Tony🦥😂
Omg why  do I want this 😅💯😵‍💫
Good luck with this one! Can't wait for the next episode 😅
Dont they cat B it and say break only
You win some, you lose some.
1:04 Amsterdam is not a country xD  I love the video anyway ;*
What I’m the DDE
The MatClaren 🎉
Freddie with the P1 and now Mat with the 720s lol
Cool car, but can it be fixed 😬
I said "you know it's bad when he says it" at the same time 😂😂😂
😬
man, that last 1m subs came fast!
Love the content matt❤ going to be a awesome build!!
End of re-build....
How much would it cost to fly Freddy's carbon man over to fix it ? Possible solution Matt good luck 🤞
Mat your a legend lol and crazy m8  this is going to be epic content ❤
I think this is a goner unless you can find a new second hand tub
Getting flashbacks to your first C63, but you’re a different beast now to what you where back then, you will think of something. Great content as always ❤
Isn’t it a carbon Monique frame?
I know you’re gonna need a LOT of this to do this one. So here’s a HUGE good luck. And there’s me thinking my M135i’s  damage is a pain in the a$$
Bravest build yet! 💪🏼
wait the dads name is tony? THEY SPOILED IT FINALLY 13:30 ish
This is almost as bad as the Lambo brother
I like the project. It is a great challenge and I am curious how you will solve the problem. A new monocoque will surely be too expensive.
Surely they could have told you they couldn't repair that from the photos!!
You’re my fav YouTuber
He finally said his dad’s name…Tony!😂
Oh my god, I’m on a 20 second unstoppable ad before the video has even started and I can’t wait !
😊❤awesome
Hope Matt has seen how his bmw rebuild bodywork is going coz them guys not getting enough credit for there fabrication skills come on people go drop a sub to them
TONY IS THE NAME!
Another great video
Mike and tim feature ❤
8:18  11:05 15:00 20:55 HIS DAD NAME IS TONY 🎉🎉🎉🎉
"The country we are flying to...Amsterdam" 😁
It's left hand drive anyway so ship to the US and do another Freddie/Mat Collab 😁😉👌
I just cannot imagine how I have seen rs6 run or gt3 run… that this will be normal car ever again but I’m all ready for it and I hope it will be like new cuz Matt is known for making things like that happen
As a german, I can confirm that the people of the country of Amsterdam definitely speak German😂  Honestly mate you should stop hanging out with Americas. It's rubbing of on you
The part when the pyrofuse mod was done and the porsche badge flashed on the screen got me dying 😅😂😂😅
See if Tavarish carbon repair specialist would be willing to fly over to repair it Matt! Loving all your builds 👌🏾👍🏾
Good luck mate
they had to tell yo in person then its an instant no, could easily have asked the size of it
All sense …. Gone
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Was waiting for Matt to buy a McLaren.. had to be 720… good luck with the build
What a long way you’ve come Matt , so happy for you!
GEKOLONISEERD
The country we are flying to...Amsterdam😑
Made in Sheffield them carbon fiber body's.  Give them a call
Dud you touch cars that the dealer and other car repair shops wouldn't dare to touch, it's too much of a liability for them, but you seem right at home with these types of projects. You are insane!, but you've made me your # 1 Bro Fan in Maryland... Lol
17:36 i love how we all have the tradition on matts vids to start the car almost together in spirit. 😂 please always do this. :) saying that i never knew how hard it is to actually start a damaged car when you mentioned about brake pressure and what the car is needing when its broke. Looking forward to this one. Not really a fan of mclarens but i am now if matt has a damaged one😂
Good luck Mat repairing the car, i have confidence you and your gang will succeed with this one
So the ferarri and the lamborghini ?? Supercars to complicated?? I did not see the end result..no dealership review for the ferrari or the lamborghini??  We want to see those car completed!!
Tavarish has entered the group chat 😅
Who else was excited to see Mike Essa 🙂
LETS GOOO FINALLY!! 🎉🎉🎉
MATS DADS NAME IS TONYYY😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉🎉FINALLY WE ALL KNOW NOW
Now you know how Alfred feels.
TIL Amsterdam is a country 😅  Greetings from the Netherlands
His dads name is in the video. Mystery solved it’s Tony!
FINISH THE FERRARI 😂😂😂
Tony is the name of Matt's father! Finally!
We got mat's dad name?   Tony?🤨
Honestly if you pull this off,this will be the best build so far.
Good old mike (dde)
I know your dads name now cause this video ahah
How much will you have to pay to register it here? Isn’t there a massive import tax on it?
This one is going to be the big one. But I'm sure you're gonna pull it off.
Whats your name TONYYYY
You can I believe the previous version of the McLaren share same parts with 720 so might be able to find some parts
have you seen dde and their mclaren 720 price for parts
Mat and Tony. I’ve got no doubt that you guys are gonna do this 👍🏻
Mat and Tony. I’ve got no doubt that you guys are gonna do this 👍🏻
Daai Kaaskop maak 'n lekker deal met die Souties...😂
Yesss!!
Time to ship over Freddie’s mate to fix the tub
Welkom to the Netherlands mat!!
The country of Amsterdam. Lovely this time of year I heard
Tavarish is here! lol
Think you've bitten of a lot on this one,  sure you will complete it bit the budget is going to be extortionate 😮 but i wish you all the best 🤘🫣
Honestly that looks beyond repair.
Oh my, a Mclaren 😍
Never thrust someone who want to sell a Car ! ! !
video good
Oh wow. Welp, I know how expensive it’s going to be especially since that’s the same area that Daily Driven Exotics 720s have. Also the suspension is going to be a pain for Matt to do because you have to take it to Mclaren to get the system recharge to work again. I’m curious of how he’s going to do this
Lol. Flashing Porsche up on the screen when he is talking about the pyro fuse 😂
Mate ….. you must have balls bigger than King Kong
Vtoned have changed a tob for his car maybe it’s better to call him😂
11:50  looks like french mate 😂
The country Amsterdam 😂 also known as Holland
mad lad
Surely they could have said the same seeing the photo you sent them , second opinion I would say …..😊
In a previous video Mat's Dad said nobody knows his name but it's mentioned in this episode!
Get a used tub? Vtuned in the USA has swapped tubs on one of these.
Probs stoned as fuck when it got totalled fair play
Someone can fix it, don’t give up
Jesus… that’s a chunk of work you’ve bitten off 🥴😂 keen to see how this one pans out!!
I'm guessing £30-40k in repairs!
Ha ha ha that is one insane project and I cannot wait to see it progress. Absolutely love the 720’s!
Who dares wins ❤
Good luck Mat
mar after buying a wreck car..."i think, i've made a mistake"
Oh Im ready for this
I love Mclarens....Prolly my favorite...This will be fun to watch but looks insane....
so glad to see the car on the channel now having being lucky to see the reveal at gravity!!!
8:20 So your dad's is Tony!!
This should be a really good one
That Porsche logo 😂
Ahhhh she dropped the ball, his names Tony! 😂
I was waiting for that video like a kid waiting for his grades 😂😂😂
2 videos in a week from Mat is an amazing wonder
Without the intercoolers connected the car won't start and idle, will just switch off
loved the max verstappen pop-up.... i hope you bring this car back from the brink...
Far too short M.A. , we need lonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnng videos.. well i do ..
Good Luck!❤
At this point I’m surprised you don’t bring pyro fuses with you when you go look at cars, it’s always a pyro fuse 😂
😮 massive job!
Looking at this and the cars that others on YoutTube are taking on I am trying to calculate when someone literally buys the burnt ashes of a car and tries to put them back on the road. Wishing you all the luck in the world, that one looks badddddd.
Man please post the video after 3 or 4 days don't take much time. Love from Bangladesh Love to watch your video
We finally learned your Dad's name!!!!
To went from a Audi Ty to a mclaren, Ferrari two lambo a rs6 gt3, gt4, lbwk Maserati and Aston Martin
I love how much Mat managed to fit in one video! I can't wait for this mclaren build
“The country we are flying to? Amsterdam.” This guy talks and acts like my 4 year old niece, and still I can’t get enough 😅 charmer.
Glad to meet Tony!! Aka mats dad😂😂
Never take anyones word for anything man!
Mike Essa is such a great guy!
So Mat's dad is called Tony yeeeeeeeh
The fact that he threw that curve ball at Porsche tho 😂😂😂
Freddy will help you
Love the split-second of shade thrown at Porsche when talking about the pyro fuse!!
i would have thought you'd have a bin of those pyro fuses on hand by now lol
The builds are getting crazier!!!! Fingers are crossed that this won’t be another C63 (the first one) 😅
Matt: "The country I'm flying to... Amsterdam"... it's hurts mah Dutch soul. Even though I've been living in Ireland for the last 17 years
no way im going to amsterdam in 8 days thats crazy. maybe ill see the car
Here we go again. South Africa waits for the final product.
That Porsche logo pyro fuse reference was brilliant!
I'm all for watching people rebuild cars and stuff, but when there's damage to the carbon monocoque, the risk just isn't worth it. A repair job, regardless of how good it is, will never be as strong as it was, and with a car like that and the performance it has, it just isn't safe.
Again a big mistake this guy keeps making fool out of himself.
Wait a minute…did you just reveal your dads name???
I do love the videos Mat. But you did just say Amsterdam was a country. Sorry 😂😂 ❤
''country we flying to: Amsterdam'' painfull
@Tavarish come get your mans
From fixing up a golf gti to a McLaren on YT in 5 years is awesome achievement 👏🏻
I dare You To Pin This
I'm at 2.52, please, please don't have spent over 50k for these remains. They should have given you it, fingers crossed.
mat armstrong (breakers channel) thank me later
yes dutch people are trustworthy 😁
maybe if u put the led headlights in the rs6 ull get some good luck
Didn’t realise amsterdam was a country
Hhmmm tub damage? Run away
New project 🔥🔥🔥🔥🍿🍿🍿
Make a vedio with carwow ...love from India ❤❤
Amsterdam is NOT a Country
Please remove this video!
i think it’s a mistake
oh jesus Matt your going to need a mircle and a big bank balance to put this back on the road 🤣🤣
I can’t believe your dad brought the car back to you in that condition 😂
I love your video plz mention me in the next video thx 😊
Your dad's name is finally mrntioned 😂
MCLAREN 720S?? LESS GO
"The country we're flying to... Amsterdam..." 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
So long as your dad is smiling you will be ok. 😳❤️👍
A McLaren and your dad’s name, all in one episode?! Niiice!
Welcome to the beautiful country of Amsterdam :p
Nice me like car
welp mats dads name was leaked GG
Your dads name is Tony right?
Uhm you never make a mistake! Lets gooooooo😂
I know what's wrong with it, it ain't got no gas in it.😂
Dde fam♥️
Matt has evolved so quickly, it seems like yesterday working on the bentley and S5 in the driveway
Amsterdam isn't a country :D
That sublimal jab at Porsche😂
Ah yes, Amsterdam. My favourite country.
8:15 oh hey Tony ;)
He must be super rich
Next car is probably gonna be split in half...
Turn it into a speed boat. 😂
his name is tony? 😮
Wow
TONY
Mc skillet had one as well 😂
Freddy has a guy that does carbon fiber.
TonY!!
MATTS DAD IS CALLED TONY. Finally the big reveal
NO WAY
Best YouTuber
We all know at some point Mat will get a Veyron or a Pagani
Mcclaren don't let anybody repair their cars with good reason.
Great video Mat and Toni, goodluck on the build 👍👍
Steering wheel is on the wrong side for a start
He We Go again 🔥
Nah bro this is a dead car
"Hey i have seen this one..."
Anyone else notice we got dads name reveal?!
Tony!?!
i love amsterdam 🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄 When in rome!!
Can’t wait for project 720s to start 💪🏾🔥
14:10 cheeky Porsche
Oh my god! Matt, you’re a legend!
TIL Amsterdam is a country
Amsterdam is a city, Netherlands is the country you flew to 😂😂
Should of run,run fast
Did you finally buy one that's beat you?
Thumbnail   😂 so cheap  Me who  is struggling to buy a normal car second hand🤣🤣💔
Ooh we got your dads name  again in this episode 👀 T***
At least you know who to call for advice 😁
I LIVE IN THE NETHERLANDS 🎉🎉
Tuned in from  Kampala Uganda 🇺🇬🇺🇬
Omg Matt posted
Let me guess.. you are gonna sell this too after building it right?
The video we’ve all been waiting for🙏🏻
As someone who made a lot of those carbon parts in the past, I’m interested to see how this goes good luck Mat
Absolutely astonishing content keep up with the dedication amd motivation Matt
Hallelujah! Been waiting for the day a McLaren arrives - can’t wait for this ! Nice one Matt 👌🏻👌🏻
Mate i am so ready for this rebuild to start  can't wait Mat Even i might to a rebuild for a nissan R34 Cheers Mate

Mat, now we know ur dad's name !!!!
Oh no ! You did it this time , at least you can sell parts of it !😁
Errr...is Amsterdam a country?
Did he just say 2 hr flight from UK - AMS ffs EDI (Edinbrugh) - ALC ( Alicante) is 2;30 ffs
OMG this is one of my Dreams cars ❤❤❤ Looks so incredible 😍
Yes finally a 720
I love this channel but I’ll never not find it funny in the irony of his sponsor. It is there to help you avoid buying accident damaged cars when thats what the Chanel’s main focus is 😂
@6:32 fellow Dutch people will know: this guy’s accent checks out as being a trustworthy dude.
Finally a Mac
Cats out of the bag his dads name was said on the video
You guys really need to check the DDE 720, suspension job is wicked. All parts are expensive. Damn
the country we are flying to, "Amsterdam". Yeah i'm pretty sure Amsterdam isnt a country 😂
You might know a man that has a few spare parts 👍
"The country we're going to... Amsterdam!" Bro skipped geo class
6:53  mans bullshitted ya 😂
I love the drama. Of course the car is not worthy of being repaired, but the worse it is the higher the YouTube views.
Amsterdam isnt a country btw, but this is awesome! good luck!!!!!!!!!
omg when u upload it makes my day  and are u gonna keep it when ur finished
All the Tavarish, DDE and V-Tuned fans looking at this......"its not that bad"
no way
Wow 😮😮😮😮 Serious Levels here now
nederland!
WhistlinDiesel has a Ferrari for sale....cheap!
Y wud u buy a left hand drive?
is channel 2 dead now Mat ?
mat stepping up his game, love to see that
@Tavarish can help you with this build. Should have a co-video with him.
legendary mat! Super excited for this one!
Amsterdam is a city not a country no?!?
The country Amsterdam 😂
Cant wait to see this in a drag race with Tavarish's P1, when they are both done.
I was hoping Mat would get this car
"The country we're flying to: Amsterdam!" 😂😂😂😂
This is INSANE lol
Did anyone notice someone say his dads name 😂 hey Tony 😁😁😁
Please help me I want to work with you please give me a chance
Amsterdam, my favourite country 😍
Yasssssssssss
Mat Amsterdam is not a country mate!
Very cool to see you comming to amsterdam welcome ! Cant wait to see this build! Know you can do it like always!
Mat 720s vs tavarish p1
i want to grow up to become amstrong
Mat loves the Netherlands and Max 😄
I always admire your enthusiasm Matt. Good luck with this one.
Iam suprised you didn't take any tips off Tavarish and not bother 😂😂😂
Half price for 3/4 of a car. 🤔 Why not! 😁
I watched one hit 227.8 MPH in a mile at elvington airfield in york the other week 💨💨💨
Amsterdam is not a country 😅
Looking forward to this project
The Country we are flying to… Amsterdam… uhhh… 🤔🫠
oh dis gone be gud. He said if freddy can do a p1 a 720 must be easy. please do a built motor!
The country we are flying to, Amsterdam 😅 ohh mat!
DDE might be able to help you same with tavarish lol
I'm too grateful to see this. Thanks for taking this car as a project.
You are mad!
Airport looked like east midlands lol like 20min away from where i live
Amsterdam is no country mate
1:05 Sums up how most tourist look at the Netherlands
Vtuned youtube channel did a tub swap!
everything is repairable :)
Can I have the damaged carbon disk
welcome in the shit city of the netherlands 🤣😂🤣
I'm gonna have to use my most well known phrase on you Mat. YOU PLONKA!
It's not a mistake just more work
That's a lovely accent you have. New Jersey? 😂
AMSTERDAM aint no country, would be sweet if it was though
I knew it called it days ago 😎thanks to MSB
Ask DDE the issues to fix a 720
LETS SEE A CORVETTE NEXT !!
mate, wtf are u doing?
Amserdam is not a country and you always say "I have made a big mistake" but at the end everything goes well, so stop crying.
I will be at gravity show meet you there
Hi Mat  GG
Sell it for parts to Freddy...he needs them
No not the mclaren, they broke even if they new
🇳🇱🇳🇱🇳🇱
Well welcome to the money pit call mclaren😅😅. Another epic build coming up. Crash in the Netherlands, build back in England
Nothing to say but good luck❤❤❤
please give some money for my new buisness
These McLarens look great, but the build quality is questionable, and the amount of repairs is almost like a really expensive Alfa Romeo
Let's go. Super excited for this build. Reminds me of the dde 720gtr. Nice seeing Mike, Tim and dave in the video
Yay it got better pretty
I was just wondering about you buying a McLaren and this just came out. So excited to see what you'll do with it. Best of luck!
I must be weird, dont like McLarens at all
Amsterdam is not a country! But close enough! (Coming from a dutchie! 😊) This project is gonna be epic!!
At least its not all corroded from salt water.
