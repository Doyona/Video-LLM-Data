For the newest raids April 25 - May 5th 2024 there is a 3% chance to get Salty Herba Mystica upon defeating either of them. As always, only one catch per profile regardless if you did this raid before.
I know I'm late, but would anyone have an extra Walking Wake they could trade?
Is it shiny locked?
Can someone trade me these please? I missed them  :(
How can I get it now?
Can u still get this in 2025
Praying these raids return again. The last 2 I’m missing for my full living dex on sv
Can you help me get fin zen evolved please
I hope they bring these back I missed them  :(
Battle lvl is actually 100
Ok so I know this is 2 years old but can we still do this? I just got the games and found this video. I have violet so not walking wake for me but I’ll take the iron leaves
I got both waking wake and iron leaves in violet
Is it limited time?
John I have beat in the indigo disc and I still can’t get iron leafs
Lairrrrrrrrrrrrrr😢😢😢😢😢
Time stamp 11:30 that's what she said
1:01 HOW DO YOU HAVE THE BOX LEGENDARYS
So u don’t need dlc right?
Can it also be found the base game?
I’m very late to the party here but is this Pokémon available in any other way these days? Or was it a 1 time event?
It didn’t work 😢
I managed to get walking wake by myself
Can you get both of them in the same game?
It's happening again. I just got Walking Wake
This raid coming back the end of this week  For one week!
Good News!!!!! They are returning from February 21 to February 27!!!!!
I’ve seen the credits, caught my legend and it’s not available in the new update for me in 2025? Do I have to beat the elite 4 a second time to complete?
Tree more days for my birthday
Can I have walking wake
😊
An water Pokémon that can be used in suny teams, thats a Nice surprise
I love that they brought back the legendary dogs
great, so I can't complete my dex..
Very disappointing that you can only get these via raids. I got the game only now.
Um im in october 2024 is it unobtainable now?
Just started playing i dont see the raid after following steps did i miss out?
Is it possible to go back in time by turning off the internet to raid this
Sad i missed all these goodies. Sucks to be poor
Was not true
Hey Austin John, I did what you said but my game made it so that I got a bunch of golden outbreaks of Larvesta and Bagon. So what’s that about? Just curious. If you responded and have an answer thank you.
Let s trade walking wake with shiny hoppip
How did you change the version of the game? I'm in version 3.0.1
Omg can we no longer catch them??
How did you get a future Pokemon in Pokemon Scarlett!?
And I beat the game
John I can’t find the raid for walking wake and I’m on the newest update what do I do?
Well missed it but phew don’t need it for the Pokédex
Will they ever come back
I missed it again :( I hope that they will return.
So unless we played those or trade for those we can’t complete the Pokédex?
I died in iron leaves raid and I’m guessing he doesn’t respond anymore does anybody know?
2.4K
Why do I keep getting blissy instead?!😭
I figured it out finally
Why isn't the walking wake and iron leaves event letting me catch the pokemon if I've never caught then before let alone I never part took in the original event either
In my scarlet game I’ve finished the game and updated it but he’s not showing up
It’s not working for me I can’t find it
Dude I SO want a Wlking Wake and Iron Leaves. Can someone PLEASE trade to me? I have some eggs to spare. I will only accept if the deal involves giving away an egg. I refuse to give anything else. The eggs will have good Pokémon.
I might use Terapagos with a DIFFERENT Tera Type (NOT Stellar) to annoy the other raiders because it glitches the game lol.
I have a problem. I once traded for (Japanese) Walking Wake, but I never caught it. Even so, I can’t get the Tera Raid to spawn. Does it count as “catching” it if it’s traded for and registered to a Pokédex?
btw i used iron leaves against walking wake and i somehow got walking wake cool!
Do we need switch online to do it with other people?
Why would you want to play Pokémon go now that everyone’s a Sheman 😂 what a joke
Its back baby!!
Yo Austin Thank you for the video I actually did a new playthrough 3 days ago just for Walking Wake and Iron Leaves Im doing a Challenge Catching every Gen 9 Pokemon only Poke Balls now this event is live I catch the 2 Paradox.  But Austin I have a good Feeling maybe the other Paradox Exclusive DLC will be Time Event just like Walking Wake and Iron Leaves Hopefully because that will be cool if they do that.  Keep up the amazing work.
Dude I don’t see that Pokémon on my game
Can I still get Walking Wake? Or should I wait for the event again? Currently playing Pokemon Scarlet.
I cant find any of my 5 star raids and I'm champion Are there cool downs for 5 star raids? I've never done one before
When he says water i hear "would er "
Hi! I’m playing again and right now I can’t find Walking Wake den. I miss my chance? Or I’m i missing something else to unlock it??
Such a L I can’t get this now
I didnt play the game at all,i just start the game one week ago van i still get walking wake or no?
Walking Wake, Iron Leaves, and Pecharunt are the only Pokémon that can be registered but are not required for the completion of the Blueberry Pokédex.
I missed it are we SOL?
I just got the game, is this still available? I have the previous paradox dogs, but not him
is it still avalible? i just got back to the game
where do we find these guys?
can i still Get it if i have one that i got from trading? Bc i cant se it. CAN I NOT GET THIS ANYMORE?!?!?!?!?!?
Wait this isn’t a permanent thing? So if you missed it you just missed out?
dam missed by 1 day, does anyone know if it is coming back ever?
Thanks for the tips. I just caught one
Brooooooo, my very first 5 star raid was the suicicune one, and i re-did it atleast 5 times until i gave up, i had my lvl 100 kiridon and i still cound't do it :L, also my spelling is perfect! :P
Looking to trade  Chimchar for turtwig Oshowatt for snivy Froakie for chespin Scorbunny for Grookey
Really need help with this struggling to even get even half down
with them being back now i´m glad i took a look at the video again before doing em again as i have some files where i need em
hey austin what's you're favorite of the 2 walking wake or iron maiden
For anyone returning for this event, I highly suggest a single strike Urshifu. Do a sword stance into a wicked blow and it's an easy 1/3 health gone (and this was with bot team), do a second wicked blow (assuming it hasn't put a shield up but for me it didn't until after second WB) and then by this point it might have taken tera charge and cleared your sword stance so if you have a shell bell you should be fine for this, but if you use black glasses like I did, maybe have an intentional death; you should have plenty of time left anyway, and then do sword stance, wicked blow, see if you can terastralize to finish it off, if needed that is.
I used Diaga with life orb and just used iron tail until I caught it. It was very quick too!
I used Diaga with life orb and just used iron tail until I caught it. It was very quick too.
Thank you
Can you make a guide detailing how to unlock 5 star terra raids?
I literally can’t win either of these, what Pokémon should I use? I get one hit with every Pokémon I use.
Me bringing lv. 100 Zapdos because i didn’t catch it the first time
how the hell does a water dragon know flamethrower?
From what I've read on Reddit (and later verified personally) when the tera raid enemy removes your buffed stats it is only for one turn. So the second Belly Drum is not necessary.
Who else is here checking this out bc you missed the event 9 months ago and gamefreak has blessed you with another chance to get walking wake and iron leaves   🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️
It’s coming back
R they comin back coz I got the games nearly a yr ago but have t started coz I’ve been getting other Pokémon from different games so I can put them on my violet game.
Can these Pokemon be caught right now without DLC? December 2023?
Can't believe i missed this raid
I was watching the video on how to catch walking wake and I went to the location and it wasent there i am in a newer update but then I think that wouldn’t effect and the Tera raid is not there
So this raid is limited to some date?
Can you trade me walking late because I am not able to get it because I am playing Violet and I can give you something cool
I *Really, Really* hope that when Indigo Disk DLC releases we will have another chance at getting these two…just not in seven star raids leave them in five star ones.
i thought in order to get the 5 star raids i had to complate all the main game arcs by doing 1. beat all the gyms 2. complate the 5 star factions story arc 3 after doing all the gyms beat he elite 4 and rivel to become champion and 5. compleate the area zero story arc
Anybody gonna talk about how good the outro was
Is it too late to catch them now?
Bro is a math god😂  Base 80 boosted by 50% is 140??? 😭😂
Is there still a way to get them?
Looking to trade a Shiny Donphan and  Glimmora scarlet version.  Looking for Sprigatito and Quaxly normal.
So I cant get this Pokémon now after finally coming back?
It’s not in my map
can you still catch it rn
I’m watching this video looking for this damn Pokémon not realizing this video 6months old 😂
Wait how did I just find out this was an event I thought it would come out in a dlc rip
Can we still get those Pokemons?
It makes me sad that i visit this as i just started Scarlet 2 weeks ago so i missed my opportunity 😕
That is really unfair that some are not able to get them without trading like me dont have the game very long cant get them anymore
If anyone can trade a WW like if you are shiny hunting by egg and has an e tra hit me up.
Six months later I just found out about this event 😭
I was watching the anime and I realized goh caught suicune and a friend of his caught virizion
What if I’m on software 1.3.2 because that’s what I’m on. Is it too late for walking wake?
I don’t are anything in 2023 idk
I just started Pokemon Scarlet and the gf started Violet about a week ago. I am worried that we may never see Walking Wake or Iron Leaves. Do you know if the raids will return soon, if not what might be other options?
I know it's probably over with but do you need to pay $$ In order to get these pokemon
Does anyone know if the Pokémon are now unobtainable or if they’ll add it to a dlc, I missed the event sadly
Are they still obtainable?
I hope when the DLC drops will be able to use and transfer over the original dogs
will we ever be able to get walking wake again?
I came late
What's the 6 digit link code for Walking Wake?
Are these gonna come back
So, super late, I was deployed during the release, is there any way to pick these two up now?
Thx
Are these still available on version 1.3.2?
I wish pokemon didn't do event exclusive Pokemon i got iron leaves but i didn't get walking wake
I have noticed that the future ones are just “iron something” but past ones are different names.
Is this limited
Can we do a link trade
Can i get free froakie please really want one
Austin
For some reason I can't get it
I cant find it
Walking Wake is easily one of my favourite Pokemon this gen. It's too cool
Iiar I can't find any one of them and I've seen the credits for the game already😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡
I Dont have Pokémon scarlet only Pokémon violet
Hi 😊 is this real btw u can also get it on switch in Pokémon violet??
So i went to the same tera raid but i didn't see the walking wake it was just a different pokemon is there anything that i missed?
Four months later and im wishing i could have these because i got scarlet and violet after this
Does anyone know if this event is coming back again?
I can’t find either one of them
Yo who wants to link trade me walking wake for zwelious? (RN ONLY)
Give me walkIng wake
It's not popping up for me and I'm champion
Why does the title say "over"?
I’m out for summer right now and I’m coming back into SV 😭 sadly it’s too late 😔
is there no way for me to get them now :(((
What year was this and day, month too
Will Nintendo bring back walking wake and Iron leaves for those who have missed the raids?
Do you have to be on ver. 1.2.0 or can you be on a higher version because I’m on ver. 1.3.1 and neither of them are showing up😅
I’m so mad I got the game the day after the event ended
Where is it
I missed it. I was WAAAY too lat to get them apparently. This was still helpful though. I still need them, but  unless they come out in another event, I won't be having them. I blame pokemon for making game exclusive legends limited time offers. It's a real middle finger to the customer.
My raid was a random Pokémon how come his is a legendary
Are these ever coming back :( I missed their 2nd run because I thought I had until 11:59 my time zone, but it was on a different time zone. I just got switch online so I've missed out on quite a few. Wondering if they're never coming back.
Does anyone know if this an event? Like, can I still get it today?
I updated to 1.3.0 and I can't find the den raid on the map, I went to the poke news too
I don't get it in my violet. I have been looking for 3 days and it still not appear them...I don't sure how to do with this event.
i was under the impression i could only catch Iron Leaves in my Violet version. But I caught both in the terra raid, Walking Wake and Iron Leaves.
Trade Link 6742 I need  Sandy Shocks
Anyone who is trying to do iron leaves, PLEASE use goldenghoul or unaware skeledirge, that being said, anyone who has violet & wants to join up to get one, I’ve been trying for HOURS and people keep using the wrong things 🥲
If anyone is still trying to do the walking wake, I managed to beat him with a level 100 raichu, moveset was nastyplot, lightscreen, thunderbolt, thunder, item held was shell bell. Light screen, nasty plot, nasty plot, thunderbolt back to back until terestalize, then continue thunderbolt
Wow the raid disappeared before I could challenge it, I just updated yesterday  Realized I needed electric type to beat it so had to go train 1, now it's gone, and I can't get it back
This really stinks because I lost my save and had to restart my game. Haven't even made it to the Elite four yet
I don’t have friends to raid with sadly 🥲 is there an easier way to catch Walking Wake without friends? I tried numerous times with multiple Pokémon and failed so so miserably each time. Any tips on how to beat it if you’re battling it alone?
Definitely should've chose Scarlet rather than violet...
I have a very minimally played scarlet and my other friends don't have much trained Pokémon (unlike my V) so we had to run my friends hands using BD and use wild charge off of the electric terrain as we hope and pray it killed in time
Is this still obtainable?
How do u get both
can u only catch one of each or only 1 and cant have both
Austin you genius... reposting.. for the hype
Why these sound like game titles and not pokemon...
So, I just want to be sure. All I have to do is finish the main game and I can encounter them? Because I did beat the game and battled both of the professors on both games
Walking wakes look like suicune
Walking wake looks like a fusion
Fun fact: Walking wake and iron leaves will return on may war so if you don’t have it yet good luck!
Can you do it in 1.3.0
So pumped this is coming back! I bought the game about 3 weeks ago, missed all of this. Excited to be able to get both via online! Walking wake looks amazing, excited to see how the other parts of the trio look.
im to the point that i can rematch the gym's, but i cant see the raid thing for Walking Wake, please help someone i also im up to date for version 1.3.0
DLC Is garbage, can't find how you start it meaning i wasted money. Pokemon needs to die obscurity at this point. Nothing fun about wasting money anď not making the game reasonable.
I’m hoping in the future we can get them in just a normal encounter I only had violet before walking wake came out and I was really sad I couldn’t get it since  it looked so cool hopefully in the dlc we can get it with the other two.
Missed this event
I captured iron leaves the last week of the event and i go and wanted to play with it a week later and its no wear to be found actually upset
Hey John do you know when the raids will be available again I think I missed the event
Am i late?
Skipping a day forward doesn’t seem to be resting my raid dens anymore… is that something they fixed in patch 1.2?
will this get another run coz i took a 2 month rest from playing
Can I use a different Pokémon than gimmiegold?
Anyone have a extra walk-in wake or would like to tera raid so I can get it.
pokemon scarlet and violet where the legendary pokemon return for the raid
God dam it I missed them that sucks
didn't get any notification for this event great ;/
iis this raid over?
I hate that I'm watching this 2 weeks from now and I really wanted CURSE YOU UNIVERSE!
How do you go from 4 star to 5 star raids? I’ve beat the game, but the 5 star raids are not popping up on my map. Wasn’t able to get these Pokémon because of this problem.
Thanks youtube for the recommendation today /s
I missed the deadline. Will there be another chance to do this raid?
Will this event happen again? I missed it
Seems that I'm with time, UTC+8 .. beat the Elite 4 but didn't get it .. :/
Thank you so much for the video! With your help I was able to get both!! Love your channel and all of your content! 💗AJP!!!
Omg!! With just two hours to go, I DID IT SOLO! Thanks to this video! I’m so happy man🤩🥳🥳   Two days ago I saw this, and didnt even had a level 100 pokemon, beaten the elite four ++.. soooo INTENSE few days of hardcore gaming😂 I FREAKIN’ DID IT WOOP🎉🥳😍🙏🏻
It says I caught the Pokémon and never received it, is that regular?
to me tera raid battles are the worst part of this game. they are not fun.
Is the event still going
wait is he gone as of march 12?
I haven’t been able to find one and now I’m nearly out of time, I updated my game and got the PokePortal news. I really wanted to get an Iron Leaves so I could trade it to my friend for a Walking Wake 😢
Im way late to the party and for the last handful of days i haven't been able to join any walking wake raids since i have Violet, it really sucks since i prefer it over what we got on our side
So i dont have resource nor time to build gholdengo. I use 20 rare candy to build my ceruledge only to fail misserably on iron leaves. Finally did it with Scizor.  I’ve wasted many rare candies😭  Also why is the timer is super fast when we fight online with strangers??
Does that mean you only do the victory road and beat the elite 4 and become champion to unlock 5 star raids? Because I did that but still don’t have access to iron leaves….
I capture iron leaves but it didn’t register in the Pokédex
Hiya. Today is the 3-11-2023. I haven't got the chance to find Iron Leaves. Could you help out on providing any useful advice?
John I caut both if you go to poke portal and Tera raid
How do u know when u are at the right updated and it not showing up for me
Gamefreak wtf!? We can catch 2 box art legends in one game but only one paradox that was added
How do i get these to appear!?  Im on violet and have even beaten the post game, but every 5 star psychic raid i go to is a bronzong or something similar
so i’ve only beaten the pokémon league and the rival battle  what else do i need to do to unlock the 5 star raid event  i have not visited area 0
Your pay to win cring bozo ratio😂
Can anyone raid it together with me i had a hard to time to defeat it
This Pokémon is totally gonna be in the dlc so if you don’t succeed, you’ll get it then
Question, i'm not at the endgame yet so it's not possibile for me to do the 5/6/7 star raids yet and i Just saw that the event ends in 2 days, am i able to still do them if i don't connect to the internet to get the new raids? I tried to look for the info on internet but i didn't find anything, does anyone know if it's possibile to still do them after the event ends?
Can you catch both in the same game?
Will you be able to get them later on or is this limited time
I just used goldengo with thunderbolt nasty plot light screen and metal sound went down pretty quick on walking wake
I cannot catch either. Every single group I join isn’t strong enough. Its extremely frustrating
I have iron leave there??
I have shine blue taourse??
I have walking wake there???
I used a Flutter Mane with assault vest and charge beam to catch this thing.
appreciate the heck out of these guides!!!!
Did they change the spot? Or is it different everyday - mine was outside Area Zero...and I haven't seen any blue star raids since the update.
Can u catch them in online raids? or do u have to do it alone with NPCs to catch them
Weird thing today only got 1 psychic raid and obviously it wasn't a 5 star don't think I'll be getting iron leaves.
I just grinded after buying this game just alittle over a week ago, JUST beat the champion and followed your first steps, and it’s not showing up, somebody pls help Do I need to fight Nemona again? (I fought her after the champion battle ofc) do I need to fight Arven or the Director? I really want walking wake
Ty sooooo much been trying for sooo long to get this😂😂
I struggled for hours.  I have no competitive pokemon so I had to juice a scyther to level 95
John maybe it’s in area zero
So i need to beat the game to get iron blades den? Because I haven’t found it yet…
So you don’t have to beat the post game and the two other story lines you just have to defeat the elite four you just have to be champion so the five star raid battles are available?
11:27 👀👀👀👀👀👀
Hey John can I bring my sceladerg to walking wake cuz it has shadow ball
Oh so we can catch multiple
You’ve said some false info that’s wasted my time, in order to unlock these raids you have to beat the elite 4, area zero and team star. Basically you need to see the credit roll. You said we only had to beat the elite 4 and become champion, please be sure when you make videos like this it’s super misleading and can waste peoples time
Medicham is beast against walking wake, give it clear amulet and use thunder punch/drain punch and you will never die in the fight 👌👌
Iron Leaves was super easy with my beloved Skeledirge !! 5 minutes tops
I got walking wake super easy using meowscadara with flower trick I just spammed that and it died kinds easy
Is it OK to use a level 84 pokémon to beat Walking wake
I wish these were a bit early on in the game so that I can get on both versions I haven’t played for a really long time on Scarlet.
Man they really did violet dirty. All we get is robots for every pokémon while scarlet gets actual different designs
Question how do you get a Charmander and are there going to be any other generation 1 Pokemon Nidoking
Still can’t win this raid my teammates get ko’ed fast
I really hate the delay in the raid battles. They really need to fix that asap.
I have just became the champion but not able to find these Pokemon!
This is making me try to finish the story before this event ends
Hydro Steam is what Scald should've always been
Hi love your videos!!!! I am having problems getting suicune Tera raid battle, I already have it updated but still no show. What can I do or  what is the problem. I haven’t passed the game yet I do have all the badges and skills for Koraidon, just need to fight the stars ⭐️.
I can't do any of these terra raids. They are way too hard I font understand it
Future pokemon?
Need to beat this game and do this
I think Iron Meadow sounds better than Iron Leaves ngl
I've beaten the Elite Four, I've updated my game, I've done the Poke Portal update, and even after changing the date on my system and restarting, Walking Wake is not appearing on my map! Has anyone encountered this and can offer some guidance cuz I really want this pokemon!!
8:05 Just realized I have the exact shirt you where wearing I wore it 2 days ago
Not sure if anyone is still looking for iron leaves answers, but I built a skuntank using screech, focus energy, foul play and taunt 252 into defense 252 into hp and dark tera, worked surprisingly well
I never even found the raid :(
Got a critical hit with a belly drummed Iron Hands and took over half the health of Walking Wake in  one. Was quite funny.
Can you masuda breed these for a shiny?
do i HAVE to be on the internet? i dont have nintendo account :(
I beat both of them first try dk if any one else did but hopefully u guys get them
Can someone please help me I can’t find it ( I play Pokémon Violet )
Why do they both look like pokemon that were already created in the past games?
I just want to ask this can you collect exp candies and Rare Candies to get your Pokémon to level 75+ or do you have to grind throu battles with wild Pokémon?  I have yet to even start Violet and I might replay Scarlet because I AM NOT fond of Sprigatito’s evolutions   🐈 Pokémon SHOULD NOT BE BIPEDAL
Hey sorry Im a little late but don’t get much time to play. I’m unclear, is it one EACH of walking wake  and Iron Leaves per save or only one or the other on each save?
My Skeldirge defeated it on first try, without it being specially trained, it was literally my starter.
Trade codes for walking wake for iron leaves??
Sooo the raid for walking wake arent showimg up and if it does its a sylveion or a garchomp its geting close to ending and im really confused on why i havent seen it :( i really want it
So Can you still get them in the game still?
one shot walking wake lol
crappy a$$ game got boring real quick after beating the game
Damn I guess I need to finish the game in a week. Only 10 badges in
Anyone got a walking wake raid I can join? 😢 I only have violet
i cannot find this thing in raids no matter what :(
When you said "dont bring  a grass type it has flamethrower" I was on my way with meowscara
I can't seem to find it anywhere on the map
Why won't iron leaves appear?! i don't want to miss it but i cant make him come!
I just got my walking wake and it has a mark
Ah yes, dividing 80 we get 60! Thank you for the math lesson today ;)
Suicoon had a huge glow up
I just bet the elite four and became champion but it’s not showing up for me.
Suicune on Steroids.
I used Annihalape for walking wake..1 boost and 3 screech and rage fist one shot. Haven't gotten iron leaves yet as my violet file isn't nearly stong enough..
I just became Champion but i can’t find the wake raid anywhere?
Bro I played on violet and it let me get the scarlet exclusive paradox Pokemon lol
I did everything right at the beginning, but I still haven't encountered Walking Wake yet. Do I need to do something else?
I didn’t get it on my raid. Do I have to buy the Nintendo net?
There’s no added area or story? How do i access it?
I beated the eait 4 and becam champion but I don’t see it
Do I have to beat area zero part for the Tera raid to spawn it won't spawn on the map I beat the victory road story part but no 5 star raids are for the any type
Iron leaves is broken super cheap. It doesn't matter if you follow these guides or not if it spams the same attack that can drain your energy all the way to zero there is absolutely nothing you can do. It doesn't matter if your max level and have the pokemon that is suppose to be strong against iron leaves type.   This games entire raid battle system is hit or miss.
NGL the one catch thing kills the key element of pokemon trading, and I dont like that they decided to make this a regular thing in S/V for special raids.
Im mad cus i actually like walking wake and i have violet
I can’t find it
Walking wake I ran with Espeon magic bounce Psych up, light screen, magic leaf, calm mind
I got iron leaves with lv80 Scisor iron def sword sance fury cutter and focus energy all  evs into def and atk nature atk+ SpAtk- item shell bell  Iron deff once or twice than focus energy and spam fury cutter
Austin, this Chanel and you has helped me incredibly much in different situations. So keep it upp!
ive done the the elite 4 but still cant find or fight them is there a reason why?
Beat Elite Four/Victory road quest and still don't see Walking Wake
I wonder if my lv 70s pokemon could survive this battle?
Anybody realize he had a cinderace in his boxes like how?
Was that Randolph on the Outro!?🤯
Do I have to have Nintendo switch online subscription to get this event ? I have just beaten the Ellite but I do not get the raid
For Iron Leaves I used Goldengho. Nasty Plot 3 times and Metal Sound and then I one shotted it with Shadow Ball while holding Wise Glasses.
I just beat iron leaves with my Ceruledge using bitter blade and shadow claw with charcoal and maxing out the attack stats with swords dance, thanks!
are the pokemon tradable because i have violet but i like walking wake more
I beat the champion but I don't see the den I think I got to beat the whole thing
OK I could use some guidance, I've beaten the pokemon league ad become champion. I however have not finished the area zero part. My issue is that I can't seem to find these pokemon in any of the raids for either game. Is there something I'm doing wrong or that I'm missing?
Murkrow is great against Iron Leaves
is it two weeks and it wont ever return? or two weeks then it wont be back until dlc?
With Walking Wake if they get frozen you can use hydro steam to dethaw yourself
Wanted more content not fomo
I didn't get the pokemon rade so what should I do
You can one-shot Walking Wake with Iron Hands-Belly Drum-Punching Glove-Thunder Punch
are iron leaves and walking wave available when the dlc comes out?
Does anyone have a walking wake there willing to trade? I keep trying to do the tera raid, but it keeps saying unable to join
Dat Pokemon is a dinosaurus
Am I the only one who can't hear anything?
How to start your treasure hunt teal mask
Wait so you can’t catch one of each? The one you catch is the one your stuck with?
Hey John i can't tend to find any if the iron leaves raids even tho i already completed the game what do i do?
I currently use this as my tutorial to freaking get access to the Read, and I just got to the point where you said don’t bring grass type because it has flamethrower. I brought my starter which is a grass type
For anyone who is playing scarlet here is for walking wake Slowbro you probably have from cinderace and greninja Stored power Amnesia Nasty Plot Slack off Held item: Clear Amulet for noble roar
Use miradon instead
Verizon wireless was the hardest raid I've done... took me 15 tried with goldenghoul and I ended up beating it offline
I caught a Walking Wake, but it isn’t in my PC or boxes. Any idea why?
Can u catch it before you beat the elite four?
I'm about to try to battle it online now but I have had lots of trouble trying to find walking wake (yes I got the new update) and I still haven't got it
I understand you can only catch one Walking Wake. But if you have Walking Wake, can you get an Iron Leaves later? Or is it just one of those paradox forms per save file? I'm trying to push to unlock these raids, and started the game when these were announced.
Ya know i got them easy i used grumpig while my friends used the slowbro method while grumpig confused set up psychic terrain reflect and light screen while for walking wake we used slowpoke and stored power it the entire way
quick question if i don’t like the 1 i got can i release it and try to catch another one? 🤔
If anyone is having trouble with Iron Leaves, I heavily recommend Kingambit. It resists Leaf Blade, is immune to Psyblade, and takes neutral damage from Megahorn. I used one with Max HP and Attack investment and Adamant with a moveset of Swords Dance, Taunt, Sucker Punch, and Kowtow Cleave with Electric Seed as the item. Taunt is to shut down Leaves's own attempts to use Swords Dance while you use SD to boost up. Idk if this is consistent or not, but after 3 SDs, I have OHKOd Leaves with Kowtow Cleave.
U lied I got pikachu
I kept failing with Kingambit for Iron Leaves until I ended up with foul play instead of kowtow cleave (sp?) and an electric seed. Iron defense and Leer helped a lot too
If anyone can help me get Iron Leaves for my Scarlet game, I'd really appreciate it. I got both for Violet but can't take Iron Leaves in Scarlet with what I have available.
Lol I beat the Iron leaf 2nd try with my lvl 100 murkrow
Another good option for Iron Leaves is Kingambit. Just used two swords dance and a kowtow cleave and it got 1 shot
I have a dumb question, might have something to do with my raid spawn luck, but do you need Nintendo Switch Online to encounter these pokemon? I've done the date/time swap a lot of times and still cant find my Iron Leaves
Why it seemed like the timer was going much slower for you but was going fast when I do these raids??!!
Hatterene can Magic Bounce Noble Roar back at Walking Wake, sometimes it will keep spamming itself with debuffs.
i just used the default azumaril for walking wake lol.. didnt glitch or anything
Paradox suicune is one of my favorite pokemon in a long time lol idk what all the hates about
So this is how I see things the Paradox Mons are not the past and future versions of the Mons we know. Instead they come from two different universes. The past come from a universe that is in a prehistoric time period maybe there are people around in that universe with those Mons. And the future Paradox Mons aren’t the future versions of the ones we know but are also from another universe that is set in a more futuristic time and instead of living Pokémon the people there have built their Pokémon.
Don't see how people are able to catch these 5 star and up pokemon in those raids. They make it hella difficult to do anything. And the terra transforms take up too much time!
If you are going to get the walking wake give the clear amulet a try it stops the noble roar from lowering your sp.atk/atk it helps
for those looking to get iron leaves, skeledirge has been the best for me so far
What are the best ways to get them both
Another W for scarlet version 😎
I hate it how you have to beat the entire game for These pokemn Luckily they will come back in future events
these raids are too hard
Boxes are still unbearably slow
i cant find the walking wake tera raid
Hello guys I catch those 2 from the 2 versions ( scarlet and violet) the natures was random and I want doing those again for the best natures. Because you can't catch more then 1 version per save "if i delete them and doing them again the game let me catch them if delete them?"
I had my switch and all my games stolen last month while in Poland. The console and games can be replaced but the devastating part is that I’ve lost about 400 hours worth of saves and shiny hunting across PLA and Pokémon Scarlet including all of the Tera raid event Pokémon. From what I can tell I’m pretty screwed here but does anybody know if there’s anything I can do regarding the lost save data?
Nearly one-shot Iron Leaves with Legend fish. :P
Lag lake is still lag lake confirmed haha.
I am not seeing my Raid for WalkingWake- am i missing somethin? I became a Champion but haven’t gone to AreaZero yet
When I battled walking wake I used my raichu with rain dance and thunder to defeat it
I’m hard struggling getting these aaa
That is so lame Nintendo to make it limited and don’t say anything about having to beat the elite four that I remember
You know what sucks? The fact that I neglected beating scarlet and now having to beat the whole game up until area zero AND level up and prepare my pokemon to beat walking wake all in a week and a half 😵‍💫😵‍💫
Me struggling to get iron leaves with npcs
So do you need online for it?
If you have Nintendo online you can get both mons by joining the online raid of the paradox mon not exclusive to your game
So I haven't been able to join either raid online bc it stops me and just says that I can't join due to a Pokemon in my party and I've swapped it 5 times including the hisuian zoroark they gave us lmao idk what to do
Bisharp / foul play :) for Iron Leaves
It’s a shame it’s a raid I didn’t really care for the raids
Just use electric birdy for walking wake. Tailwind and thunder work great.
I can’t wait to see the past and future versions of the other two members of the Jotoh Beasts and Swords of Justice, respectively.
Do I need Nintendo Switch Online to do this Tera Raid? I already beat main storyline, saw credits, and I did the Poke Portal thing like John says, but when I try to leave the Portal it warns me that I'll be disconnected from the internet. I then look around for the Tera Raid and nothing ever pops up. So do I need to pay?
I cant vind it in my game. But im conected to the internet
Thanks for this Btw👇       God LOVED you so MUCH that He sent His only son to die in YOUR PLACE so you won't have to die under Gods judgement but live forever IF you fully trust in Jesus, now that he's risen. Please repent from thinking wickedness 🙏🙏🙏
I'm all kinds of confused how an ancient Suicune can exist. Lore-wise didn't itself, Entei and Raikou come into being in the Burned Tower in Gen 2? It's been a long time maybe I'm getting a few things wrong but three pokemon died in that tower and were revived as they are now.  Now we really need a Legends Johto game to explain this. Lol
If i do not update the news will it stay?
my amphoros was great against walking wake but iron leaves is beating me down so bad rn lol i keep switching it up but there are some really great suggestions in the comments, so thanks everyone !!
I am not seeing how to change held items from the boxes.  Not during the Pokémon selection part of during raids.
Buy one per save, do you mean that if you catch one of the two paradox, can you not catch the other?
Do you need a Nintendo Switch Online subscription to get these?
Can I use time skip
Always love an ASJ video, always have great info. Thank you for your time and professionalism always. Keep doing you.
Well, I have 2 weeks to beat the game then. I hope rushing it doesn’t rob me of the enjoyment.
I love everyone complaining about performance and I’m over 400 hours on 4 play through of version 1.something lol… Its not bad and after way OVER 400 hours I’ve had no crashes on a new OLED.  I will update soon, just had to wait for any fun glitches to be found. No dupes or anything. Just love dropping out of the map and things. Defiantly time to update. Just got busy with other games…
as far as the game running smoother after you put In scarlet.. I seen a video when arceus came out about the game running smoother when it first boots up. over time it gets worse. I forgot the terms used but moral of the story, they said you should just restart the game every hour or so if you want it to be smooth your entire play through
Everyone!! If you have Nintendo online, you can get Walking Wake in your Violet game or vice versa! Connect to your WiFi, go to the Online Raid Battle button in the Poke portal. You don't need link code you can find the opposite raid to join of the different version of your game! I suggest playing once during the work day if you can wherever you live. Less people online then so you can get in a match. Then beat and catch! Hope that helps people! I didn't understand how many people both for a while because it sounded like you couldn't get the other in your own game unless you had the other copy. Wanted to tell others in case they find this video to help out before it ends!
Would have really liked a more clear explaination that I need nintenedo online in order to access either paradox forms for these Pokémon
just gonna -humblebrag about the first raid build i've come up with myself instead of copy-pasting from austin john or a comment on his videos- share my solo build for Iron Leaves:  Scizor @ Wide Lens Technician Lax (Relaxed will work too), 252 attack, 252 defense Fury Cutter Double Team Swords Dance Rest (didn't end up needing this, can be replaced)  Double Team once, Swords Dance at least once, spam Fury Cutter, reap rewards. probably helped that one of my NPC allies was Intimidate Arcanine, but still  i also considered X-Scissor/Scope Lens instead of Fury Cutter/Wide Lens. may try that version tomorrow
So i already became champion and updated my game and used pokeportal and even completed starfall and path of ledgends...but i still cant do 5 star raids? Do i need to do the post post game to get iron leaves? Am i do sonething wrong or were you mistaken?
120*
How do you get it to spawn? It won’t for me
Hi I was wondering if you need to finish all of the game to get it to spawn because he isn’t appearing for me I am already champion but haven’t gotten to area zero yet
Wait, if ho-oh revived scuicune, was there an ancient one that did the same thing ??
3 type pokemon smh
Is this the only way to get it ? Like u can't catch them in the game later on in the future
Why the need to make these raids so damn difficult gamefreak?!
how can i join you
I just did a Tera Raid and got Walking Wake, still thinking about if I should get Iron Leaves
Anyone knows the answer to this? Can I release Iron Leaves / Walking Wake so that I can catch a better one in tera raid?
Can you get both in one game if you link up with a friend
This was so stressful, I was able to barely beat iron leaves with grimsnarl after about 50 tries, and I got super lucky with a team of two iron hands for walking wake, I ended up just cheering them on to boost attack. I hope they don't do a bunch more new pokemon exclusive to raids cause I did not enjoy that.
I can’t even find walking wake and I beat the elite four and updated my game???
so i gotta beat the game first ?
Dang we beat him and we still lost the raid some how. Seem like the game froze then it he kept attacking while we couldn't do anything and he had no health. I was so confused.
You can also catch Iron Leaves in Scarlet caught mines yesterday long as you go to the portal.
Do you need DLC to catch these?
I got mine first try with my lvl 75 Meowscarada clear amulet and flower trick
What pokemon would you use for the scarlet version? Moves and training?
Small question, I still have Charizard with the Mightiest Mark spawning in my game. No Walking Wake at all...what is happening?
Hi Austin John. If I release walking wake, will.I be able to catch another?
Hey John what held item are you using on that gholdengo sir 🤔🤔🤔
This hurts to see because i just changed my Switch and none of my Scarlet save data was backed up so im starting from scratch 🙃
Calling it now the photo of the entei suicuine raikou fusion form was a hint towards all 3 getting paradox forms with the other 2 coming out in each dlc as well as a sword of justice paradox in each
Do I need Nintendo online to get it?
iron leaves is just virizon but in the future and IS WALKING WAKE AND IRON LEAVES EVEN A NAME???????
Iron leaves was difficult…. Had a 4 man team for that one…. Used roaring moon against it.
Walking wake was easy…. Used slowbro
Do you have to finish the game cause my friend just got to area 0⃣ and there not popping up
Walking Wake makes buying Scarlet instead all the more amazing! What an awesome pokemon!
Walking Wake and Iron Leaves are Paradoxes that aren't also legendary so their BST is 570
Annihilape 3 bulk up’s 1 screech 1 rage fist 1hko on iron leaves most effective for solos also recommend you have drain punch just in case your cautious
5 star raids are not easy. It mostly depends on the team
Wha??? I have to have become a champion to be able to get it?? So not fair!! And only 2 weeks?? Nooooo 😢😢
Walking Wake is not showing up for me. I followed all the steps, but none of the water raid dens on the map is Walking Wake when I get there. Online mode is on, and I've defeated the Elite Four and everything, so I dunno what I'm doing wrong here. :/
Wish I could get walking wake
i used a Shadow Claw, Swords Dance and Reflect Ceruledge and it was pretty easy fight with Iron Leaves
I'm so bad at Pokemon
I love the little talks at the end
I wanted to see how powerful Walking Wake was, so I just threw my lvl. 100 Meowscarada out holding a Metronome.. Did I not beat it first try spamming Flower Trick 😭 luck of the draw, he only used flamethrower once the entire battle lol
Hello! Can someone assist me in trying to figure out how to unlock access to these raids? I’ve done: -The Final Battle unlocking my Legendary -Gym Rematches -Academy Ace Tournament  -Unlocked Black Crystals  But I’m still struggling to find this seemingly elusive raid, is there something Im missing, I’ve updated to the latest version and stuff, so I’m not sure why it isn’t available yet, or if maybe I’m just blind or unlucky?
Tfs
It sucks we can only get just one per save file.  I hope that Walking Wake & Iron Leaves will be available again in the future.  I'd like to be able to get both pokemon for my collection, but I only have Violet version.  I'm even willing to wait a generation or so into the future.
I ended up nearly maxing out my Miraidon’s attack, speed, defense, and HP before actually being able to catch W.W. And even then it was down to the wire. It’s so satisfying to win though
Iron Leaves is impossible to beat!
pls tell me how to install the online version for pc
I’m looking to trade for a iron leaf. I have a full shiny living dex and doubles of tons of Pokémon including charizard, Greninja, and cinderace if anyone is looking to trade I have plenty of shinys I’m willing to trade for a iron leaf
I can't find walking wake in my game. I've beat the game up to the elite four and still can't seem to find the raid on my map.
Is this only a limited time? I haven’t beaten the game yet
I think it's pretty dumb that they only allow you to catch the version exclusive once. Not sure if you can breed them, but I'd assume you can't. Makes it so the people wanting a living dex, but don't have both versions/haven't progressed through the other version/don't have a way to trade with themselves are kinda out of luck here. I get it with the 7 star raid mons that those can only be caught once, but you can breed those and get more.
I have a little theory that if the two of them weren't JUST used as a marketing ploy for the DLC set up at the launch of the game, then we could get dual dragon type Johto Beast Dinos and Terminator style dual psychic Sword of Justice, but I feel as though the dragon typing for the Johto Beasts is easier to pull off because you saw how well Walking Wakes design was executed, you could just make Entei into some type of T-Rex and Raikou into a full smilodon, but with the Swords of Justice the psychic typing makes sense in terms of the original trio shared the Fighting type but the issue is even if they get their cybernetic redesigns the psychic type doesn't really fit the other two, maybe for Cobalion they could go Steel/Flying and Terrakion being Rock/Fairy? Idk I like the idea of the Sword of Paradox to all have typing that 1) reflect the original members and 2) beat out the original shared typing because power scaling and "uniqueness" and etc
Fun prediction....the paradox mons in the Violet and Scarlet books are still yet to be out in the game. I do believe those are forms of Virizion and Suicune but I also believe that the rest of the Dogs and Swords will get Paradox forms and then an item to combine all three of each into one pokemon...which we see on the books and are somewhat identical to the new paradox mons but are not the same...I don't think those Pictures were out there by accident and not be out into the game.
When in Paldea, do as Austin John does, never fails, thank you so much!!
Another pokemon in this video would work GREAT for Iron Leaf if you can get someone to get a taunt off turn 1 and that pokemon is Herocross with Swords Dance and Mega horn...holding Life Orb. Easy One shot with a support Mon knowing Screech and Taunt.
Do the new Paradox Pokemon count as legendary Pokemon
Do you have to have the dlc to get walking wake
Can't get both even joining a raid that hosts the other version exclusive.
Awesome 😎 can’t wait for the dlc walking wake was easy iron leaves took 7 tries
it is so stupid that one needs to pay for nintendo subscription
Hey, I'm not able to find the sparkling water Tera raid icon, is that a problem or is it just like a chance thing
Two things: 1. I guess this confirms ho-oh wasn't the one that created the three legendary dogs or changes it entirely. 2. I hate these future & passed designs, hope they are only a passing gimmick.
John I'm  a kid an I love ❤ you
have no idea how it happened but i used the same method for Iron Leaves as you, but i used nasty plot twice and my brother used one set of fake tears and using hex once killed it without a shield going up
It's really annoying you can only catch 1...
I am trying to hunt walking wake it's been 2 days but it's s it spawning I even tried to change my date and time
The Hisuian Zoroark is quite good for iron leaves if you have it. Dark tera type and tera blast does a lot of damage, and their new move bitter malice drops attack as well as does damage even through shields.
GUYSSSSS  I did iron leave right now.  It helped 4 bulk ups and lots of phantom forces with Ceruledge level 100 using shell bell🙌🏽💗
I used my Slowbro with leftovers with the following moves: Stored Power Nasty Plot Iorn Deffense Slack Off Run nasty plot till either you get +6 Sp Atk or half health then use slack off follow with stored power, terrastilize and use stored power
its not showing up in my game and i have scralet and i haev beat the eilte four and i am on the lasest update
Just started the game so I don't think I will make in time for this event, but on the official Pokémon website on this event they said these two Pokémon will appear again in another event for this game.
how was goldengo built was that a different video I missed?
Can someone tell me why the tera raid isn’t appearing for me? PLEASE!!!
i cant get waking walk to spawn. i finished all the gyms :{
I give up on this useless game. Been trying to beat this crap for hours and hours everytime I am near beating it time runs out. Pokémon has become a game you need to spend money online just to get legendaries or enjoy end game because it is unbalanced it is a joke.
do you have to buy the dlc to get them? im updated and dont see them \
So I have a question. Would their exclusive moves, Hydro Steam and Psyblade, have their secondary effects activated with a booster energy, or would it only be effective if it was an active sunlight/electric terrain?
I didn't know they were verison exclusive I caught both through the tera raid menu
So I have pokemon scarlet and I already caught walking wake. Can I catch iron leaves too if I join somebody's raid ?
OK I hope im not the only one with this problem. whenever I enter a raid, It says that even if I'm victorious I won't be able to catch walking wake. why is this?
I cant even win. So sad😢
Scizor+Fury Cutter (only) is the fastest win against Iron Leaves
Is anyone trading? I have not completed my copy of scarlet so I can’t get it.
If you don't have both games how can you get them both? I've tried Google no luck
So not sure if its something I'm doing but since updating and purchasing the dlc I am no longer allowed to launch my scarlet and violet cartridges on different consoles at the same time on do local raids to get the version exclusives :(
I hate that those 2 are tied to raids. Raids are what made me quit the game. Picked the game up again to try an Catch those 2. 1 hour later and I hate them more then ever. They lag like hell, are super glitchy buggy, are not really fun and honestly the second I see that stupid shield pop up with no one being able to terastelise I just want to quit.  + How can the online for those be even worse then the sw/sh was? Like I can not get into any of the raids on the bulletboard. They not once worked for me...
these were pretty easy to do but honestly so fun^^ i used miraidon for walking wake and chi yu for iron leaves, got em first try ^-^
Walking Wake took no time. Iron Leaves I'm on my 4th one.
are we doing join codes for these?
I love how he just said quash like he never heard of it
If you have a meowscarada I would recommend using it and spamming flower trick I beat it with a 80 level meowscarada I had very few time left but since flower trick does so much dps I pulled through
If I have Scarlet can I join an Iron Leaves raid and catch the Pokémon or do I need a Violet copy?
Use annihilape he one shot both of the new Pokémon let his health go down used bulk up and then rage fist
Man I haven’t even beat the game yet… so I guess I miss out
Whelp time to level up my goldenghol
I can't believe they made a patch that made raids WORSE  Screw the DLC, this game is a broken mess
I can't find the den for the raid, and I'm in the postgame. does anyone know why this is happening?
me and my friend were able to easily beat walking wake with iron hands w/ belly drum and thunder punch or a miraidon w/ charge beam and electro drift
Yeah I'll have to keep trying offline. These online raids have trash players for some reason.
Everything I bring against Iron Leaves seems to do okay, but the other players are getting destroyed instantly.
What date was this footage recorded on?
is it possible to do a walking wake raid in violet if you join someone else’s raid?
Hey 👋  Why can’t I find any of these raids!? I don’t see them at all! Someone please let me know why
Do you have to download the DLC first in order to encounter them
Ceruledge absolutely walked through Iron Leaves.
So after two weeks, we don't have a way to get either anymore?
What item did you use for gholdengo?
They could just do new pokemons, that suicine look a like shares too many similarities, quiet lazy to me for getting tons of money from their loyal poke fans
LOL, I beat Walking Wake in 4 turns, was lucky but it was too easy have to come here and brag. Miraidon: 3 x Metal Sound + 1 Electro Drift. You have to be lucky enough so you wont die...
Well I managed to catch Iron Leaves and if it makes a second appearance in the dlc well you know what I'm gonna do with the 2nd one
I haven’t played in a little while but am I right in thinking players in violet can still get a walking wake but just can’t host the raids? paradox suicune is just gorgeous I need one 😅
You're able to join raids to catch both Walking Wake, and Iron Leaves in a single copy of the game, right?
At least some people can’t say suicune is a legendary dog anymore. Beast always sounded better
Does anyone want to trade a walking wake for my iron leaves? I only have violet so I cant get walking wake
I caught walking wake first try iron leaves however was a pain
Bruh can someone help me I don’t see any 5* raids & I definitely beat the game just not post I’m literally in front of the gate arven tells us to meet up at since he gathered penny & bemoan to help out
ADD TRADE CODES
In your Vivillon video, how were you able to get Scarlet/Violet mon into Pokemon Home?
I already got the two yesterday.
Walking wake was   light work.  Maxed out ev Miraidon smoked him  For Iron Leaves I used Grimmsnarl.  He's immune to psychic blade and foul play or play rough hurts him bad
It seems dumb to have the event be 2 weeks
I'm going to need help to get Walking Wake, I tried the Pokemons to take him down, I tried Pikachu Lv 67, Abmomasnow, Leafeon, Baxcailbur, Zweilous, do you know how to make any electric pokemons strong?
I didn't figure this out on my own (thank you people in this comment section), but for Wake all I had to do was use Miraidon. Metal Sound, Charge, then Electro Drift. Miraidon was holding the Clear Amulet. Wake has a dragon type move, but it either never used the move, or the move only does half health. Unsure how consistent it is tho!
The designs are super cool but I can’t get around to liking the names… idk if I’ll ever get used to it
miraidon brutally murders walking wake, but viron leaves I don't know if there is any big counter to solo it. I did kingambit, but was extremely close
Game freak did another terrible job more trash legendaries designs are trash scarlet and violet was a waste so will the dlc all this money for both games and they gave us trash legendaries
If I have a Scarlet game, can I join a raid from a Violet game and catch Iron Leaves?
I used Iron Hands for Walking Wake and Kingambit for Iron Leaves.   Both worked extremely easily.
I am 100% positive because of this past water/ dragon suicone for dlc we will be getting a legends game either this this year or next or could be letsgo johto
I’m only able to solo that darn iron leaves if an npc has intimidate lol that certainly helps, if you you can get two npcs with intimidate it essentially cancels out swords dance.
For iron leaves it went well for me. I crushed it with my eviolite bisharp. Swords dance to +6 and night slash.
Basically hydro steam is scald on roids
So i need help my cousin released my walking wake is there any way ill be able to get another one?
I just started my scarlet version to get it going and oh boy, speedrunning to beat the elite 4 is oging to be fun...
I couldnt see it in my map. I have pokemon scarlet. Completed the elite four and became champion. Do the raids restart every day.?
FOMO has killed it for me. I’ll wait for them to release a Pokémon game that isn’t live service or FOMO centred.
If I have Violet, can only see Violent raids when I search online? Or was I just very unlucky last night?
So can you breed these? Or is it just unobtainable for the other versions?
Hey John, would you please be able to share your Gholdengo build?
Hey Austin or anyone I need your help I have physical copies of violet and scarlet do do I have to buy two different dlc for these or is there a way to buy both
If anyone is wondering you will need to beat the entire game all the way up to the credits to unlock the raid battle not just the elite four
I think that next year, GF is gonna do what they did in 2021. Release a remake of an older generation, (Gen 5.) and release a new Legends game all because of Walking Wake.
Bruh these future pokemon be rubbing me the wrong way 😭.  The primal forms and pokemon look way cooler and like they fit better to me, and I got violet version so that's saying something, still love the game tho, but scarlet just hits different fr
For iron leaves, I used a Scizor with iron defense, swords dance, and x scissor with Shell bell. Not perfect, but easier to get than goldengo. It took some luck but I did solo it that way. Resisting psychic, bug, and grass was huge for me. Max atk and Def EVs
I can't even join the raid battles cause I keep getting an error message saying I can't join the raid due to a problem with the Pokemon in my party 😔
Stupid that you can only get one. At least let me catch a second one so I can trade for the one I actually want, Gamefreak.
Why does shell bell restore that much health?
This might just be because I haven't played for a while but I feel like the game overall looks better since the update
Hoping the removed pokemon are just the static/always there spawns (there's tons! You'd be surprised look it up on serebii. They are full odds shiny so, useless anyway. The only static spawns that should stay are the wild tera pokemon.
Please I would like someone to answer me this question.after the dlcs are released do I need to buy the dlc to take a Pokémon from Pokémon home and move it in violet (for example if I don't buy the dlc can I still move a ninetails from Pokémon home to violet ?)
Scizor is an even better mon to use than gholdengo (at least i think so) .. set up 3 swords dance and use x-scissor and i am Pretty sure you can one-shot the future thingy .. i used 2 and it landed on 20% hp (no set-up mons were used)
Do you need them in the pokédex to get the shiny charm
I bet they're 7 stars 😭 I've only just finished the game and still struggle with 4 star raids haha (I'm not good with the math side of Pokémon - it all mixes around in my head and is too much).  EDIT: OK, 5 star is alright, I think lol
Wow apparently if you don't have pokemon online they don't show up
I beat the elite four but I still can’t find it on the map and everything is updated as well
btw kinggambit made iron leaves ezmode
Sooooooo Kyogre isn’t gonna like seeing Walking Wake I assume
do you need online membership?
game ran MUCH smoother for me too
I caught both on scarlet bec of online raiding
It's cool they'll bring these back at some point, I wonder if they'll do the same to the previous raid mons
Magnezone can be a pretty good support with Walking wake and Iron leaves, since magnezone can learn both Electric terrain and Sunny day! :D
I got mine with the grass type starter Pokémon
I just used Miraidon to get Walking Wake (which I had a friend trade over) and then Lokix for Iron Leaves. They honestly did well, but considering they are 5 stars going against level 100s, it wasn't a surprise.
Battling Walking Wake: “Huh, that was surprisingly easy.”  Battling Iron Leaves: “Oh Arceus have mercy this was a lot harder!”
I love that thr pokemon company are so griddy that if you Don't have nintendo online you can't play that
Got both let’s gooo
chi-yu also works surprisingly well against iron leaves! dark pulse, nasty plot, will o wisp, and anything else, with a shell bell, works great!
I had no problem beating Walking Wake first try, but Iron Leaves was annoying as hell
4:43 - the correct terminology here is "do we risk it for a chocolate biscuit"
A pair of Belly Drum/Play Rough Azumarril can take out Walking Wake pretty easily. Did it on my first try. I finally beat Iron Leaves with a Scizor and a little luck on his move choices. You know, after he destroyed everything I already had for five-seven star fighting.   Scizor Ability: Swarm Item: Metronome Moves: Sword's Dance (to max) - X-Scissor repeatedly (it'll ONLY get stronger as long as you live)
Do you need online to get the new mons or no? Cuz i have been here for hours.
Woopsie, I just realized that I was looking at 2 pokemon caught from the SAME raid, so OF COURSE it was the same! I just caught them on a 2nd switch from a different raid and the IVs and Nature are *NOT* Fixed. Sorry! It's a crazy day and a lot to cover! That has been trimmed out of the video
I beat Walkimg Wake by using rain dance to get rid of his sunny day. You could also use sandstorm. His water moves  weren't an issue for me and my friend, but his flamethrower was annoying.  Iron Leaves I recommend using ice spinner to get rid of his terrain.   Best of luck everyone!
How beat walking wake solo, my pokemon are only level 70 sorry i need help
One question do I need Nintendo online
I had some struggles getting Iron Leaves, even with Gholdengo and a full team of Kingambit. I finally managed to get it on a full team of random Pokemon by giving my Klefki Misty Terrain. As soon as Electric Terrain was down, the raid went from difficult to super easy. I didn't do much damage, but other people weren't going down in the first few turns, and that made all the difference.  Hope this helps someone!
I have a raid battle question. If it’s done online with people, who gets to catch the Pokémon? Everyone who participates or just the host?
My Walking Wake had a Naughty nature 🤔
I just used iron hands with booster energy and after belly drum, my thunder punch crit him killing it.  One hit.  I uess i got lucky with the crit.  I think an ally got a leer off right beforehand so that helped too
Walking Wake was easy for me I just used Miraidon... But Iron Leaves! Holy Moly that thing took forever! Finally got it but it was really close at the end.
John, are you going to put out another video explaining other Pokémon options to beat these raid dens. Thanks!
Do you need to finish area zero to get them? cant seem the find the raids
Im so annoyed you can only get walking wake in scarlet. I want it so bad he looks so cool compared to Verizon and I can’t wait until either fall or winter to maybe get him in the dlc hope the shiny looks cool too
How did you manage to get the same npcs as the first battle?
If anyone like me wants to solo walking wake. I did with A miraidon lvl 80 soo it's possible :)
So initial testing on walking wake. The original den build for annihilape is amazing. Especially if it does the noble roar move on you cause you get 2 props from annihilape's defiant ability cutting the time needed to boost attack in half. I just beat one without even using screech to lower walking wake's defense. I used slowbro for the one I caught though.
I beat my violet one easy with Kingambit
I just beat iron leaves and I catch it. But I cant find it in my boxes😢
Do you have to beat the game to get it because I can’t find them anywhere
My Walking Wake was Bold nature with 5IV. The reason you got the same ones was because you caught it from the same raid.
I got both in Violet cause I joined a Terra Raid
i did not know i had to be so far into the game. ive only defeated 3 gyms and the flying titan. this sucks man wth
I’m wondering why Hex over Shadow Ball?
They nature it's not fixed. We can hunt the nature we want by change the date on switch. Luckily i got my modest Walking Wake on 2nd try 😆
Miraidon worked great for walking wake as well got him 1st try
I used Gholdengo for Iron Leaves, but I’d say Scizor is the MVP. Managed to get into a raid with 2 Scizors who did 2 SD each; the other two did 1 attack cheer, 2 defence cheers and reflect between us - and Iron Leaves got 3-shotted.  Prior to that I joined raids where people used Chi-Yu, Tinkaton, Skeledirge - they did nothing but faint repeatedly. One even brought in Walking Wake…
i use miraidon (for walking wake), and iron leaves ( the hard 1 for me) i use ceruledge (on my bro account) and chien-pao (a bit hard cause iron leaves have bug type attack)
For Iron Leaves - i was better off fighting it solo with a Chi Yu. you only have to worry about mega horn, but if u put shell bell and do 2 nasty plots, you'll self heal while hurting even while its shield is up. For Walking Wake - i played tank support using Wo Chein, max def and sdef ingrain and leech seed, never died to it. Sucks that i dropped other players attack down - but when most of em belly drum, it doesnt matter anyway. A few light screens and heal cheers and and we took it down fast
Thank God I grinded the pikachu event for candies
I dont got any chance to find one of them...   No leaf Raid 4 or 5 Stars  No water Raid 4 or 5 stars  Saddly -_-
Hmmm, these new Paradox Pokémon are perfect double battle team members with the box Legendaries. ^w^)/b So: The best thing to do is use Iron hands for Walking Wake and Goldengho for Iron Leaves? =/c
Easy raids with Hyddragon for Iron Leaf ( Nasty plot, dark pulse) and Thunder Punch/BellyDrum iron Hands for Walking. Extremely easy raids but worth farming. I've got an ability capsule almost every single time I've done these raids. Iron Leaf is much more viable to use for raids after being Bte
they shouldve added chest or back cannons on the future paradox pokemon to make them look like zoids
Do I have to beat the whole game to get this walking wake
For Iron Leaves i managed it fairly easily with Annihilape, bulk up to full then rage fist ohkod
Your math is off. 80 + 50% is 120 not 140
My heart shattered when i seen what thry did to suicune thats a disgusting thing to do to such a iconic pokemon gamefreak have alot to answer for ...who thought that was ok to do
Thank god you can get both Pokémon in one version via multiplayer But im dissapointed that they don't have pokedex entries yet.
you can catch both of these in 1 edition if you go onlne and find the raid from the other edition right?
Content is good! Video is looking a but over exposed though, your face is kinda blending in with the wall behind ya
As long as you have another player hosting the other raid you can technically catch both paradox mons.
Hi.., are these timed events? how long are they up?
I used Gogoat to solo walking wake and King Gambit to solo iron leaves hope this helps people also
I soloed Walking Wake with Appleton
What if scarlet was the past and  scarlet is like the future 😮
"Don't bring a grass type because he has flamethrower." I used my Meowscarada and spammed Flower Trick until it died. Worked 1st try lmao.
I just swords danced twice and used shadow claw on a ceruledge
Can my friend who has scarlet invite me to a walking wake raid?
Wait, I have to beat the elite four to get these raids? Bruh
I can’t find it… it’s not popping up for me I beat the league … and it’s not there
Volcarona solo for Iron leaves. Quiver Dance and Bug Buzz. Max HP & Sp Atk.
Walking wake was easy. I used Sawsbuck with swords dance and horn leech.  Took me like 5 maybe 10 minutes. Haven't tried iron leaves yet.
Has anyone else realize that these Pokémon don’t look anything like the Pokémon in the sketchbook? Guys I think we’re getting more Pokémon Paradox Legendaries it might be in the DLC pack 2 but I’m sure of it we’re most likely getting the other four of the 2 legendary trios
Mine is not Relaxed nature, mine was Serious Nature
Am i the only one who isn't getting the raid to actually spawn?
are you able to get walking wake on violet if you join a scarlet raid den?
I used the beast ball.
I could possibly beat the walking wake raid but i just can't get in a raid from the poke portal. Is it just me?
i have 4 cuz discords
YO IF SOMEONE SEES THIS COMMENT CAN I PLEASE GET A FROAKIE
I really don’t like that they‘re dumping these Pokémon into raids. At least make their implementation make some sense.
I'm not at the stage in the game where you can fight 5☆ TeraRaids. Is there a way that I can do these by invite or something?
Beat my Walking Wake while watching, that Miraidon set from one of your first videos did well
Any suggestions for walking wake
Is there a way to do the raid with friends (near me) without needing Nintendo online?
I  GOT A REALLY WEIRD BUG, i was playing scarlet once the update came. i went the the news etc BUT once i did a raid there was a normal type egg which i caught but it won't hatch, even with flame body i can send you some screenshots and video's but it is really weird
my trick for waking wake, lv 100 kilowattrel, learn thunder and increases speed spam electro ball , when shield upped using thunder *easier if induces paralyzed voila
Im on Violet. Took me a lot longer than I thought (Definitely tough but to be fair I went in with a Houndoom Ghost Tera type; Electric seed) but I got my Iron Leaves. Impish nature, HP 243, ATK 212, SP ATK 119, DEF 176, SP DEF 170, SPD 184. I spammed foul play on it since I knew it gets maxed out attack stats after just one Swords Dance. Definitely do not try my method lol.
Since this is 5 star does that mean I can catch it before finishing the game?
How can Suicune have an ancient form when the 3 dogs were revived and presumably created by Ho-oh? Why Pokemon? Why????
Does anyone know if you can get the other versions legendary after getting your own if battle in a friends raid? Like if I get my suicune in scarlet can I go battle in my friends violet raid and get verizion too?
Duos method:  Kingambit w/ Swords Dance, Kowtow Cleave, Iron Defense (electric seed) Bronzong: Iron Defense, Reflect + cheers (shell bell)
Hey, noob here, I play Violet and my girlfriend plays Scarlet, is there any chance we can get an Iron Leafs and Walking Wake each? Thanks for replies!
Iron Leaves was super tuff, but the Gholdengo strat ended up working after a few unlucky tries.
Ooof, these are difficult. Tried to solo with my Gholdengo yesterday, Psyblade does a tonne of damage even outside of electric terrain. I did pretty well until the end when I was KO'ed twice in one hit and thrown out...
Mine was Modest
I defeated the elite four and nemona after, updated my game, and checked the pokeportal, and for some reasom the terra den is just not showing up for iron leaves  Is there something I'm doing wrong?
Is there a way to not have the terrastalising animation because it takes like forever
full Perserker team worked really well for my friend and I for Iron Leaves. Takes next to no damage from any of its attacks and can absolutely smash it with 4 Steely Spirits active
What day did you update it to get it?
Late to the party but in case anyone sorts by "new", Scizor is a beast against Iron Leaves. Sword Dance, Iron Defense and X-Scissor and it'll go down in no time.
Easy tip for iron leaves, just use your Skeledirge with a shell bell, hit him with three torch songs, use your orb and hit him with any ghost move you have, I have shadow ball on mine, I ate his shield up with that, he nullified my stat changes I hit him with two more torch songs and that’s all she wrote. I did this second try it’s pretty free but walking wake is pretty hard.
The pokemon are not fixed natures... my water boi was gentle in nature
Someone please clear this up; If you catch the one in your native version, can you still catch the other via internet raids or is it strictly limited to one of EITHER?
I kinda hope they make paradox forms for Raikou, Entei, Cobalion, and Terakion too :3
Do I need online for this
Stupid question, can i take part in the raids From Pokémon scarlet Even tough i play Pokemon violet?
For those teaming up for Iron Leaves, the daushbun that was built for the Charizard is a great support. Instantly use misty terrain to remove not only the quark drive ability boost but also the 50% boost Psyblade gets. Then use Charm to lower it's attack. From there you can charm or use helping hand to help offensive members like sizor or kingambit
Pretty easy with Iron Hands on both of them. Caught them on the first try each time. Yes they are version exclusives but you can still get the opposite versions one with the poke portal which is great.
Really hate the people that bring that stupid fish that lowers spdef like why
I dang near OHKOed Walking Wake with Iron Hands. I had the Booster Energy equipped, used Belly Drum, then Wild Charge. If I took the time to set up Electric Terrain, I would have probably had enough power to finish it off. Thankfully the others in the online raid brought solid pokemon to put in the final damage when the shield came up.
I used armorouge against Iron leaf.  It was an easy win
Good luck with Iron Leaves everyone. It cheats and attacks you twice at some point with either Lead Blade or Mega Horn, then uses PsyBlade
As a 27 old seing this suicune. I only got one question. How do theu fck up 1 pokemon so baddddd who design these
My Walking Wake is a Sassy Nature.
I got both versions in Violet.  So make sure if you have internet.
If I had a switch and scarlet I would do a phycic terra crystal
Iron Leaves actually makes the arboliva npc a little useful, since it immediately kills the electric terrain
Omg i cant believe people is tking azumarill and charizards to iron leaves smh
Bellibolt just nerfs Suicine I was doing random raids one person brought tha violet box legend used Charge & I used acid spray then next turn we one shot it
No crit for me either
Bro this raid was so easy ngl
Can i have help i cant get any of them i cant find them
Why can’t I find the raid
Ngl Walking wake sounded like a prehistoric snorlax
WALKING WAKE IS SO COOL
A level 100 Miraidon completely trivializes Walking Wake.  Just use Charge and then follow it up with Electro Drift for an instant one-shot that skips the entire rest of the fight.  That's precisely what I did this morning, my Miraidon just outright one-shot Walking Wake with no trouble whatsoever.
Was able to get it done first try with a Lvl 100 Raichu. Thunderbolt, Double Team, Light Screen with shell bell.
already got both of them walking wake was so easy i used my vaporeon build from the greninja raid and for iron leaves is the bisharp evolution iron defense and kowtow kleave
Dude. I used a plant pokemon to two shot it
50%is 40. So 120…..
I'm having a lot of trouble still with iron leaves. This is the toughest 5 star raid ive ever done
Simplest setup for Walking Wake: Contrary Lurantis w/Shell Bell. 1 Grassy terrain, then Leaf Storm until done. Beat it in 6 turns, first try.
While fighting iron leaves I found a way to help nerf it by using flutter mane with mystic terrain
my walking wake has different stats than yours
Contrary Lurantis is really great for Walking Wake. Noble Roar actually helps by increasing Lurantis SpAtk. Additionally, Sunny Day really helps with Solar Beam spam.
Hey my guy you’re trending #8 on gaming lessgo!
Would I be able to join Scarlet raids to catch Walking Wake? I tried to join their raids but nothing.
hey everyone, nasty plot slowbro with amnesia works and one shots walking wake easily
Hydragon: 3 nasty plot, then dark pulse. Does a number on iron leaves in my battle.
Nope. My Walking wake was a different nature that actually lowered SP.ATK. and it is alert to sounds.  Yep Iron Leaf, swept my teams about 8 times. Until we finally went in with a decent strategy, oddly enough, 3 DRK and 1 GHS.
For people facing Iron Leaves: Foul Play. It will typically have at least a +3 and already has good attack
That awkward moment when you haven’t beat the main game yet 😅
Can you breed them ?
I'm having problems pugging with Iron Leaves because people's bad picks. Or they want to run Ceruledge without Clear Smog and get bodied after Sword Dance.
Could you be a little more Philadelphian, wouder
Can you get both in one game? I'm playing Violet and i keep trying to join raids for walking wake and it won't let me in.
Nice!
I just used skeledirge on Iron leaves
Walking Wake was super easy to solo with Iron Hands (252ATK). One belly drum, one drain punch to restore the lost health, one wild charge. Two hit KO if you include the drain punch.   My Iron Hands fainted with the Wild Charge but it didn’t matter in the end.
Do u need internet ?
I feel sorry for anyone who' has to join an online raid to catch either of these Pokemons.
I get the feeling that they’re gonna release 2 more past and 2 more future pokemon and there’s gonna be like an item to combine them with their respective group to make the Imagined Pokémon seen in the Scarlet and Violet book, as it looks more like the combined forms of the past and future legends instead of the 2 released today
I caught both using the Tera raid sceeen in poke portal.
do you know you can get both in the same game by going in the Tera Raid battle in Poke Portal? i found out i can get both in the same game that way, do to both battle come up in it.
having trouble finding iron leaves  Ps I caught walking wake dows that have anything to do with it?
chi yu for iron leaves is amazing
People really paid over $35 for outfits for almost a years away dlc. 🤦🏼‍♂️🤣
I was going to say that Hydro Steam will burn the opponent Pokemon like Scald, hence the steam in the name. After Austin read the description, it doesn't. Great move either way!
Still farming pikachu 7 star raid 😊
I’m going to stick with the dinosaur (Walking Wake) and Not get the deer (Iron Leaves) because the deer hits like a truck
I used Taunt Leech Life Spidops and it worked lol
Hey Austin how the hell you get you graphic so smooth?
Lotta misinformation. Still thanks for updates
It's crazy seeing the AI in your battle with Iron Leaves stay alive so long. Every Pokémon I, or anyone else had on the field, barring Kingambit would get Oh-KO'd and the match would be over in 4 or 5 turns. Even my level 100 Miraidon would be one-shot by Psy Blade.
Hey John how that 7- Star Pikachu is that good against Walking Wake with Light Ball? The only problem I hate is that it has Water as Tera Type!
I had to do Iron Leaves online because I own scarlet and it was... rough. My best luck was with Grimmsnarl. Taunt turn 1, reflect, then cheer and foul play when there is nothing else to do. If your team has one competent damage dealer, it works really well. If I went the damage dealer, however, he would just swords dance and one shot everyone.
Could someone please answer if it worked for them but am I able to join a friends walking wake Tera raid when I have Violet ? Can you join exclusive raids that aren’t in your game ?
my raid wont spawn. i even checked the news, left internet on, updated game, any idea anyone?
Annihilape will one-shot Iron Leaves after 3 bulk ups, one screech, and a rage fist.
Got them both but..I'm annoyed that 1 there was zero story involved with their appearance and 2 zero dex entry. We know nothing about these new pokemon once more! And even if they did add anything it would probably be vague like all the others paradox pokemon probably.
great video. personally extremely disappointed in the design of iron leaves; literally just a reskinned virizion. super lazy compared to the completely new pokemon design of walking wake...shame
If I miss out, will I still get a chance to catch them later?
What is the ev spread for your Goldengo mine is max speed and special attack
Great video! Thanks for the tips!
Bellibolt is really good for Wake, Kingambit is really good for Iron.
My walking wake has an Jolly nature
This was a fun raid for a five star. Both Pokémon are pretty cool.
Man, every single time I've tried to kill an Iron Leaves raid, I have been getting absolutely pummeled into submission. Doesn't matter what I use. I've tried Magnezone, I've tried Kingambit, I've tried Hydreigon.
Aw my nintendo switch was being repaired and won't be shipped back for a while =(
Just caught Iron Leaves using my Kingambit, Lord Vader. He completely owned the battle, highly recommend using him.
Defeated Iron Leaves in first attempt solo with Hisuian Zoroark. Just added Foul Play as a move on level up to 100 and Hyper Trained. 0 Ev training
I catched Walking Wake 1st try with just a Meowscarada Flower Trick spam. It was close though, did not expect the Flamethrower 😅
Basically, you have to pay for NSO in order to get these new paradox mons (I'll pass because I refuse to pay for nintendo's garbage online service that have no substance or value period)(I don't pay for online on consoles period)
This may be the best place to put this but there is a bug with EV training. I can’t get the Well-Trained Mark anymore. Maybe an error on my end but I’ve done this before the update. @AustinJohnPlays
I hate that they're only letting u get 1 of each. Because it's hard to find people to do this with
80*1.5 = 120 not 140.
One piece of advice for Iron Leaves, Bulk Up Rage Fist Annihilape solos it ez
Thanks Austin!
Miraidon sweeps this raid
gonna be honest feel like violet got kinda shafted with iron leaves scarlet gets ancient suicune which is cool as hell then violet gets one of the worst legendaries especially in looks as a future type I woulda rather had entei raikou or hell any other legendary woulda been better then one we got also iron leaves is way to small
Their signature attacks are 120 power after the 50% boost, not 140. I haven’t seen a comment about that yet but thought it should be known.
I soloed it with my king G pretty easily
hey AJP, 6:26, with the sun up that move does 120 damage, not 140. 80 base power, 80 x 1.5 = 140. you're welcome
I somehow did it super easily. I made a quick stream on it because I couldnt believe it.
Would you be mad if I told you that I beat Walking wake with a clodsire on MY FIRST ATTEMPT?? I was online with other players but still.    Iron Leaves was way more difficult to me so i didn't get it first try.
Iron leaves seems impossible
"Don't bring a grass type."  Me, who beat it with Arboliva: "lol OK noob"
For support against Walking Wake a Screaming Tail with snowscape and light screen trivializes it’s attacks. Only issue is impatient Iron Hands and Azumarril using belly drum turn one before you can get light screen up
Are you able to catch the one from your version, trade it for the other version's, and then re-catch your version?
king gambet is op aginst iron leaves it almost cant go down
Walking Wake was one shot. Easy. I AM RIPPING MY HAIR OUT WITH IRON LEAVES!!!
Question is anyone iron leaves timer going down rather fast and it sticks while fighting it
I got hasty nature on my walking wake
I'm a little confused -- is it that you can only catch one Walking Wake and one Iron Leaves per save file, or is it that you can only catch one of the two paradox legendaries per save file and you have to choose one? Edit: You can catch one Walking Wake and one Iron Leaves per save file. I have both now. Successful event was successful 🙂
I wish Walking Wake didn't look so similar to Koraidon lol
I soloed walking wake with my azuramill with huge power, play rough, light screen, belly drum and liquidation just for an added water type move
i use chi-yu holding shell bell reflect taunt nasty plot dark pulse dont even have to tera
My Azumarill absolutely stuffed Walking Wake. None of its moves can do anything meaningful.
Beat Iron Leaves with Kingambit.
what website do you use to check pokemon stat just like you did at 3:00?
how do people just level and train a pokémon so quickly??
As a Violet player I feel scammed
Thank you i barely beat it with my level 79 meowscarada
Does that mean if someone has scarlet they can never get the violet Pokémon?
We want the Snyder cut!
Cleared the Iron Leaves in 1st try with Kingambit shell bell. 3x Sword Dance then just Kowtow Cleave to victory.
Would you please give me Iron Leaves for a Grafaiai? I really want an Iron Leaves.
Kingkambit x3 sword dance and Nightslash one hit KO
I’m excited to see what the rest of the Beast trio and Swords of Justice trio will look like
Got both yay 😀
My brother and I got Iron leaves on our first try using Kingambit !
Hey man - What was going on with your camera settings? I'm about to start shooting content which is going to be a talking head with b-roll, just like how you shoot, and I'm curious as to whether I should be shooting overexposed and editing it down after. I don't mean this as a criticism - I love the channel and I just want to learn!
I love my new Walking Wake. It's big. It's a water type which will be turned into a steel type for extra resistance and equiped with Terra Blast.  And it's a raptor which is a hardly used design for pokemon in general.   I know it's not getting the love it wants. And everyone is upset it and Iron Leaves was just dropped without any kind of content lore. Nor is it matching up to the sketches in the books.   But you gotta admit Walking wake has a good design and hopefully Raikou and Entei will get the same Raptor design if they make it
I just 2 shot the wake with miraidon pretty easy. Charge beam then drift
I just want to be clear here, if i catch iron leaves i cannot catch the walking wake?
do i need the dlc for iron leaves?
Cake walk compared to that damn pikachu
For Iron Leaves, I personally use Kingambit (Adamant Nature) - Sword Dance, Iron Defense, Kowtow Cleave. Iron defense for 3 turns, Sword Dance 3 turns then just spammed Kowtow Cleave :D
Suggested builds for New Paradox raids  🍃🔮 Iron Leaves 🍃🔮  (1) Iron Jugulis (Tera dark) Modest Max Sp Atk Hold Metronome Spam Dark Pulse  (2) Kingambit (Tera dark) Adamant Max Atk Hold Metronome Spam Kowtow Cleave  🐲💧 Walking Wake 🐲💧  Miraidon (tera electric) Modest Max Sp Atk Hold Metronome Spam Electro Drift
They really made the future paradox mons look like straight poo poo
I got mines today and able to one shot iron leaves with kingambit with 3 sword dance with life orb
Can you catch both Iron Leaves and Walking Wake in Violet? Or am I really limited to either of them? I’m assuming people can advertise either in Tera Raids.
And yes, I used Gholdengo from the start against Iron Leaves solo. Nasty Plot + Shadow Ball did the job just fine. It took me three tries because of unlucky crits, but when I was paired up with a Intimidate Staraptor, it was over.
Against the Iron Leaves, I used my lvl100 Ceruledge with Bitter Blade and Swords Dance and it went perfectly. I forgot to switch to a ghost move lol
Is anyone else having trouble joining raids online? I have tried to join 20+ raids and it won’t let me
Hey can you still use the greninja slowbro for the raid or no
I was able to solo walking wake using the Laurantis from the water tera Pikachu raid.
I ran Azu Tera Fairy and used Belly Drum + Play Rough with Shell Bell against Walking Wake. So much survivabilty! Every move was not very effective. I recommend Azu instead of Iron Hands if you go solo.
Isn't thier signature moves power technically 120 seeing as the base is 80 plus 40(50%) on/in the correct setting?
Question, is there a limit to how many we can catch?
Meoscarada with shell bell MAX attack and health flower Trick you'll thank me later
An interesting play against iron leaves might actually be to bring the hisuian zoroark that you get as dlc bonus if u choose to get that. Idk but could be fun
Do you need to finish the game to access the raid?
If I miss this event will I ever be able to get these pokemon again? I'm not sure if I am strong enough in my game at this point.
Done already for Walking Wake.
I managed to get a great walking wake with sp atk focused stats so he hits really hard at the cost of his speed being decreased lol
Not the same - mine is Timid. I see others posting that as well, but hoping on the bandwagon
Not a fan they put them in Tera raids. This will be annoying.
This is really just underwhelming. The DLC doesn't look great and we're still 7 months from it. These limited time pokemon being shiny locked is really awful. That basically ensures that everyone does the raid once and that's it. Replayability is not there and it's just eh. I was hoping for something better. Why play the game for the next 7 months?
Q: I have violet. If I raid with someone who has scarlet can I get suicune?
can you get walking wake via internet in violet? i keep trying to join but keeps telling me i’m unable to join. 😩
I hope they are available in the dlc
I’ve beaten the elite four and became champion but I still don’t see the Tera raid
I am excited about the Pokémon scarlet and violet dlc and me and Chrystal are preparing for our upcoming rematch with my brother and his ghost type pal Gengar and me and Chrystal are going to win
Is it possible to encounter it even without beating the elite 4 and champion? Classes are back and Iam short on time 😅
I caught Iron Leaves with Scizor holding Rocky Helmet, moves: X-Scissor, Pounce, Swords Dance and Iron Defense. Maxed out its Attack and Speed stats.
Scizor would eat the living sht out of iron leaves
Iron Leaves keeps wrecking everything. I can't catch that thing. I'm about ready to give up on catching it.
Can you catch the other version exclusives via the bulletin board?
Pro Tip for Iron Leaves: Chi-Yu with Nasty Plot and Dark Pulse.
I've been inspired by MandJTV to use more traditional pokemon names for the paradox mon, and I even tried to come up with names for these new Pokemon. I have Terrorizion for Iron Leaves but I'm stumped on what to call Walking Wake...
So... little late to get into getting this game for these... huh? 😕
Seeing iron leaves run around all happy like is funny with primal suicune just sleeps
120* base power on both psyblade and hydro steam if on the desired terrain
Iron leaves is a pain to fight
I need help pls help me I cannot find walking wake, I did everything, updated, checked which game I was playing, looked around the whole map and still couldn’t find it! So can someone at least let me know if it is always there on the map or if it’s rare to find?
<.< the fact is had sunny day and flamethrower still did not stop me from taking my grass starter in there and taking it out in one attempt
I was under the impression that the update was supposed to fix the problem that the raid bosses were overriding the player putting in commands. I did a battle against walking wake and only got three turns because I couldn't put a command in.
For Iron Leaves mons like Skeledirge or Armarouge/Celeiedge can counter it
Pretty easy to solo Walking Wake with a Lvl 100 Iron Hands.
Do ev’s and iv’s matter when you can build them from scratch however you want in about 10 min tops?
So can you catch both of the paradox Pokémon with one save file? Or are you limited to one choice. I’m a little confused from the video.
I was disappointed that you’re limited to just one each. Meaning I have to get creative with the moveset and build so I don’t need to recreate one every time the meta changes
Why are these raids so hard!😭😭
I have that same hoodie Austin!!!
Walking Wake was not that difficult, or i just got too lucky, but Iron Leaves was such a pain. I did build a Grimmsnar, dark tera type (Dark type by default makes it immute to psyblade), max def, max attack, and the rest on hp. Bulk up and Foul play as main attacks. Sucker punck just in case
Well I believe I’m finally going to call it quits for good on Pokémon. I had a “good-ish” last few years. Pokémon are just looking sad to be now. This is Trainer Will signing off
I need to trade for the past form
Is this a limited time encounter or will it stay in rotation?
It's nature is not fixed I changed my day until I got a good nature and I got a 5 perfect iv rash
Ain't it easier online with random ppl lol I ran a kilowatrel and 2 other ppl ran iron hands i basically making it easy
Can i get walking wake in violet? Like when i join other raids?
OMG, first run getting it, group defeated it,and cought it 💖
I hope these paradox Pokémon get reruns because I only just started the game couple of weeks ago and I'm not inclined to rush my gameplay :(
I'm tha only one that can't use tha game after tha download??
hydro steam is SO broken omg
I am going to get and put walking wake in my DLC team
Is there a way to get both Pokémon in one game?
Mine was a neutral nature
So I have to at least have beaten the elite four to unlock 5 star raids then??
Will there be Entei, Raikou, Cobalion, Terrakion, Keldeo paradox versions eventually?
Used a Kingambit for my run in with Iron Leaves. Max HP and ATK, Defiant ability Swords Dance, Thunder Wave, and PP Max Kowtow Cleave with a Shell Bell. When I go for Walking Wake, I'm setting up a support Blissey.
Iron leaves is so so underwhelming in aesthetics.
Can anyone give me tips to get the raids to spawn?
These raids reminded me how much I despise Tera Raids
Violet player here. I first got iron leaves because that was the violet exclusive. Then I joined a walking wake raid and used the iron leaves. Sword danced 3x then used leaf blade and I carried
How is he getting 140 for the base power? A 50% boost to 80 would be 120. Am i missing something?
I caught my walking wake with 100 ghouldengo with 3 nasty plot and thunderbolt  I didnt even tera
What on earth now this makes me excited
A Swords Dance Kingambit works very well against Iron Leaves.  Walking Wake goes down to Electric attackers, but any Pokémon that can absorb or tank those Water, Dragon, and Fire attacks should do just fine.
no way to get the other?
Hi just wanna ask, do you need Nintendo online to be able to encounter this pokemon?
I already got em big deal
Mine was Naive… you said fixed at Relaxed…. Guessing that isn’t true?
I used a Meowscarada with foul play to counter act it's swords dance.
I was able to  both in scarlet
I have caught them both already
How are they gonna have an ancient suicune when the legendary beasts were created by ho-oh when the ecruteak tower burned down?
How horrible is the new design Suicune. I get being water/dragon that’s why it looks like a frilled neck lizard. But wow, the original depiction and picture you find in the book, the centre of its face should be more entei like, plus no raikou resemblances shown. I’m hoping they’re still planning on creating paradox forms for the other, still hoping they fuse into what we saw in the book. Because man, that Suicune is an abomination so far. The Virizion looks okay though, I’ll give them that. But y’all gone and destroyed the legendary dogs…..
Can you catch these pokemon at different sizes? Like a jumbo Walking Wake that is larger than an average sized one?
Just use iron hands for both lol
Meowscarada is good for this one.
is the raid 100% supposed to pop up immediatly? i cant see it
I can't beat iron leaves :(
How come it don't appear
I do not have the means of creating a raid ready pokemon in time, especially for how hard they seem. I guess I'm just missing out on them
What changes are recommended for these two
Can i do the ter raid solo?
I was not able to get Walking Wake even though that I defeated the  elite 4 do you know why Austin John?
Walking wake gonna be broken in showdown also roro pal is gonna be on every team in vgc now who in the right line is not gonna use the walking wake it’s sick
Begs the question are we getting the full trios as paradoxes or is it just a 1 and done thing
Miraidon maxed out help me solo'd walking wake easily without dying once. just a tip.
I’m so sad I bought violet instead of scarlet 😢
Wait I can only get one paradox per save ? Then why did I caught the two ?
Walkng wake seems to break the backstory for suicune, anyone else agree or does it add to the backstory?
Ones I buy part one and two but not now because I'm poor right now I want to rest my game why because I want to and I don't really care? But I just like playing as the dlc first then the game because when I got the dlc for the dojo in sorwd and sheld I felt stronger in spirit and in intelligence so I will like to feel that again but this is my opinion
Is there any reason my raid battle for iron leaves isn’t showing up?
just use Miraidon for Walking Wake it's as easy as that. 2 Metal Sounds, Charge, Electro Drift it's an 1hit
I just realized… they call it iron leaves yet it’s tera type in the dens is psychic 😂
People still play this embarassment of a game? You idiots didn’t get your refunds?
You can get both pokemon in one game by joining raids of other people having the different game. Just saying because I see it is not obvious to some people.
So if you use the violet legendary, it's way easier. No joke first shot is half health with electro drift on walkin wake . I just got one
Used Miraidon against Walking Wake, beat it in 7min lol it wasn't hard at all
I hate tera battles I'm annoyed they force you to do them to get the cooler pokemon
Can you battle iron leaves and walking wake in a poke portal Tera raids?
why am I still having sylveon and garchomp? I'm on 1.2.0
I found that a combo of Gholdengo and Ceruledge was 100% success for Iron Leaf. My wife used Gholdeng for dps and I use Ceruledge to taunt and reflect with cheering to keep the party topped off. She hasn't beat the final 4 yet.. and has Scarlet. 😥
Are people aware that these aren't version exclusives, they can be found in the Tera raid option in the poke portal
I have a fully ev’d miraidon, iro  leaves is gonna be great when paired with it,
So Scald was basically a Wal-mart version of Hydro Steam.
I used kingambit with real ease  Swords dance a few times, iron defense a few times and then spam kowtow cleave
Flutter Mane is preeeety good against WW, tough. The hability procs for both so you get the boost as well as imunity for dragon.
Thanks for this i now have both of them
I got walking wake on my first try, but it took several tries for iron leaves, and I really like them both. Now its time to not play scarlet for 8 months until the first DLC comes out
They should stuck with the forms in the book instead of this garbage lol
And they say they are Reincarnation of Houndours, weird  Also why is Ludroth, of monster hunter, in a Pokémon game
Took em down first try, shout out miraidon and iron heands
I hate how slow the dens move when you play online. I do 2 moves and the timer just goes down and nobody does a move then the timer bar just goes way down really quick. I don’t understand…anybody else have this problem?
ah yes 50% of 80 = 60   AJ
I've said this before, but thanks for always making such in-depth, informative, yet somehow straight-to-the-point videos.  That's a talent, man. lol   You are mine and my friends' go-to for new Pokemon news/events.
So is there going to be other times u can catch them later on in the dlc or is it only for these 2 weeks ?
Is this for the dex?
I used ceruledge it worked great
I fully believe this is just a version exclusive version of Galarian slowpoke, released as a “you get one for now” thing to hold us over for the dlc
With walking wake I got lucky it took me out twice third time I got it
Easy way to beat it is with miraidon
Recommendation for Iron Leaf is to get rid of it's Terrain immediately.  That stops its Quark Drive and weakens Psyblade, so it does a lot less damage.  If you are playing with others, a Flutter Mame with Misty Terrain, Taunt, and Charm can shut it down pretty well.  The only issue being the Flutter Mane's Def is pretty poor.
Doesn't quite work out, but I got a flying tera Pikachu.
I used for walking wake Miraidon fast and without any problem
I managed to take out Iron Leaves with my Scizor.  Double Team to start, pop a Swords Dance, and go to town with X-Scissor.  After losing to it with four different other of my raid ready Pokemon, Scizor absolutely cleaned house.  I took both of them on with my sister who has the other version, who doesn't really care that much about raids, so I asked her to take in her lowest level Pokemon so the timer doesn't go down much when it inevitably died.  Her level 5 Pikachu with Static actually ended up being really useful lmao.
Used Baxcalibur for iron leaves. Soloed it with ease.  Gotta find a good counter for waves.
Just got it first try with lvl 100 Miraidon. Two metal sound, one electro drift.  Edit: Alone
I used Annihilape alone and it was good. Had loads of time
FLUTTER MANE CAN LEARN THUNDER
Hey there Austin I am having trouble with the walking wake so I ask you for help if it’s okay
Thank you for showing me how to defeat them I have to start over so I might miss out if I don't have the regular switch and both games in time phew
That means I'll have to be quick with finding a Walking Wake raid online, since I play Violet.
It is not the exact same! I got a Timid nature WW, so they're all different.
Hey does anyone have waking wave tera raid codes?
I already got these mons hours ago, I'm just watching because it's an AJ video
I dont have the game now and i have no time to play 2 weeks Pokemon. So player who dont have the games now can never get them again??
Is there an online trading code yet to exchange these two between versions?
Metronome torch song skeledirge destroyed Iron leaves
can we get a goldingo build plz?
What is the song used during the tera raids. It sounds great
Maaannn... violets paradox pokemon are wack! Compared to scarlets....
So... can we catch one of each? Or just 1 of both?
Unaware Skeledirge with Wil-o-wisp, hex, and shadow ball was pretty effective in groups in my experience
I defeated Walking Wake with a Grass Tera Type Flareon.  It's surprisingly easy
Why do I only have evees spawning
Do you need Nintendo switch online for the raid to appear? I downloaded the last version of the game and still I can't find Walking Wakes raids
Can you catch both in one save (via internet)?
John probably answered this in the video, but I only have pokemon Violet. Can I still get Walking Wake? If so, how?
I used an Iron Jugulus I gave the Rocky Helmet to for Iron Leaves and it took a couple tries, but I got it online!
I have a quick question: Im currently on my way to the 3rd gym, with my team on lv30ish. How hard would be for me to beat E4 in time to do this raid?
Do you need to get Nintendo online to get access to this or not
I'm honestly pretty disappointed that they made these paradoxes exclusive to event raids instead of putting them in the DLC
I managed Iron Leaves in one go with an Umbreon rocking Foul Play. Judt did a reflect and then terastelized.
I caught mine it was modest nature so they are different
when i saw hydro steam i was really worried that after removing scald to help nerf bulky water types that they were gonna give an alternate form of a defensive legendary water type with a better defensive typing a move with a high burn chance and high power LOL
120 BP, not 140 BP
Um Austin i just used a skeledirge with torch song and shadow ball took 5 minutes and 1st try
Lemme guess, there gonna release these shines years after this event’s popularity
I solo the iron leaves with my king gambit 3 sword dances and kowtow cleave will do just fine
can you see shinies in the box yet
Will regular suicune be in this game? It’s my favorite Pokémon, I like the paradox version but I prefer the old one and would love to have it.
Might just be me, but Walking Wake looks like a fusion of Suicune and that electric fossil pokemon from sword/shield.
Can you breed the new pokemon or are they legendary pokemon.
Really hoping these can be Shiny in the DLC. Would love to see their Shiny forms!
I used the ceruledge build to beat Iron leaves and blissy build for walking wake went down easy
Looks like taking my time enjoying the game is gonna bite me in the ass I only have three gym badges and have been leveling up the Pokémon I caught it sucks I don’t think I’m gonna be able to catch these Pokémon
Max HP and Defense Murkrow with a bold or impish nature, holding a eviolite and using foul play is very good for Iron leaves
I actually got the Suicune with an Arboliva with full SPEDF, flamethrower did like 50PS in sun + modest nature, idk, maybe I got lucky with the damage taken. lvl 100, 252 spedf, 252 spatk. Shell bell -Growth (it gives a +2 in spatk and atk for the sun) -Solar beam -Giga drain -Whatever  And for the Virizion... I used Goldhengo too
Just a friendly piece of advice, the highlights on your skin are slightly too bright :) your face would look better if you brought them down a little bit while recording. Have a good day.
Do you need online to get this. Also will it affect the shiny charm for those who don't have it?
I got them both using an iron hands build for walking wake and a kingambit one for iron leaves it was super easy ngl
Are we going to be able to connect with the other version to catch the other exclusive?
Thanks! Your guide helped me a lot :D i got both mons
I genuinely thought this was just some fan art bs. The fact that it is real completely goes against pokemon lore and the origin for which Suicune was created. Pokemon officially died for me in the previous gen. I will no longer invest time and money in any future pokemon games.
Just caught mine, I love them
yeah they'll be available in the dlc afterwards it's kinda of a head start on the dlc
Do you have to purchase the DLC to get these pokemon?
Only an hour
What’s a good nature for Walking Wake?
Does anybody have good nicknames for walking wake and iron leaves
Walking Wake can walk on water which is awesome!
Any other suggestions to take down iron leaves for people like me who dont have golden boy?
I'm no mathmetician, but I don't think 80+40 = 140. Unless you're counting stab. In which case it would still be incorrect. Cause I believe then it would be 160. Someone check my math, cause it's a 50% boost from stab then another 50% from the terrain. Not even adding the boost from Quark Drive. So I can't tell if that's 160 or 180 because if it adds 50% to 120 (Move's power after stab), then it'd add 60 with Electric Terrain involved making it 180. Or did AJP forget about STAB and got 140 from the 50% boost plus the drive boost? This shit's why I flunked Math.
"My friends see me shining, Like I got the charm!"  Keep getting song stuck in ma head. Where can I get full song?!
Scizor is M V... mutha loving P against Iron Leaves..... Swords Dance 3x... pounce pounce pounce, do not terastalize
I’ve got my Suicune at the first battle but I still can’t get Virizion but I’ll use my 7up buddy now
Just so you know the nature can be different, my walking wake has an adamant nature from the start so it's not always going to be the same
Link to the Gholdengo build?
Why can’t I see the sparkles for the iron leaves, my game is 1.20, help!
I need a future cyber mewtwo that would make my life happy mewtwo was always so cool
My Walking Wake was Brave nature for some reason.
What happens if i dont do this in 2weeks will it be gone forever, i hvent started scarler yet, still playinh arceus cuz i got both, is it gone forever?
I assume they are shiny locked
My raid bugged and turned into an egg
caught it used using Annihilape
Is it just me or does ancient suicune not make sense according to how the legendary dogs were created. It’s like they don’t even care lol. But he is really cool nonetheless
Does anyone know how long it will last or is it a permanent tera raid until u catch it
I’ve eventually started to get bored of the game so I haven’t played it in a couple of weeks. But now is a good chance to hop back on and play a little
Pro tip: If you have access to Skeledirge, use Unaware choice specs max special/HP and just click torch song. Heal if necessary but 9 times out of 10 you won't even need to. Works well for most raids that don't clap the Skeledirge.
Is this what they looked like before they were resurrected by Ho Oh?! 3 legendary beasts were burned alive in the tower fire and then brought back to life by Ho Oh right?? Idk. Im just trying to figure out how legendary beasts born from Ho Oh in the remains of the tower can have a primitive paradox form.
Thank you so much for this tutorial! I was able to get both Tera Raid Pokémon with minimal fuss. Five star raids have been difficult until today!
beat iron leaves first try and still working on walking wake
Can you get both in one version without trading or am I going to need to do this in each version?
Can you use the trade code trick to get either pokemon you're not able to get in your game?
Walking wake is ugly no cap I’d only have one to complete the dex but that’s it
I updated my game but didn't get an option for suicune?? It's still giving me 6* hydreigon. Am I missing anything?? I can do all levels for the raid
I’ve beaten the elite 4 in both scarlet and Violet (and champion) but I only see iron leaves & not walking rage. Can I only get on on a acc? Do I have to get a 2nd acc to do it??????
I do wish this wasn’t a FOMO pokemon.
I don’t know if this will help, but I had the Clear Amulet on my Dragonite with Thunderbolt and it cancelled out the Noble Roar on Walking Wake
Do you need online mode for this?
That patch is garbage!!
Walking Wake is easy to catch if you choose Miraidon, because it gives you a great advantage! While against Iron Leaves use a Dark-type Pokémon like Iron Jugulis!
im not seeing any of the raids and im post game....
My walking wake is lax nature with 215 special atk
512 HP ON SHINY IRON HANDS??? I can only get to 389 XD
Can you please make a statement of this since pokemon pays attention to your videos, TERA RAIDS ARE NOT FIXED, it still just sits there draining the time while you are frozen in place along with your team and you cannot do anything about it, furthermore when you go down it always is random on how much of the time gets docked (which shouldn’t be a thing when teammates go down because it is NOT like that when playing with the AI)
Would houndoom be good for the future one
Hey Austin, love the emerald hoodie. Where did you get it?
Waking wake kinda odd. Not gonna lie. Water type that "needs" sun to activate it ability. Not to mention move sets are very underwhelming.
walking wake was pretty easy     note that i used a lvl 100 miraidon  that is ev trained in physical attack.
I don't know why Walking Wake was so easy for me! I solo'd it with Thunderbolt on lv80 Kilowattrel holding a Shell Bell!
Secret sword ⚔️ 😂
How do I get Paradox Suicune in Violet?
What is the website he's using to identify the raid Pokemon stats and attacks? 3:00 for reference
Wait so if I get one I can’t get the other?
John it's base power is only boosted to 120, cause 50% and its original base is 80. So 50% of 80 is 40 then add it equals to 120.
Virizon wireless💀
Hi Austin John, you said that you can only get them from these raids UNTIL the DLC drops. Is it confirmed that you will be able to get them from the DLC? I’m asking because I haven’t even cracked open my copy of violet yet and won’t be able to do the raids, but I want the iron leaves! Thanks for the great video and info!
Hey Austin, for Iron Leaves I used Annihilape with Taunt/Bulk Up/Rage Fist with Shell Bell worked like magic!
so, Ater looking at the moves of both of the pokemon: for Iron leaves, try using a dark-flying type mon. dark cancels out Physic, and Flying makes bug and grass-type moves weak. then get it to learn dark type moves and if possible, ghost type/bug type moves (since the terra type is Physic). for Walking wake, a water-fairy type is favored (the only one in the game is Azumarill though) since fire and water are both not very effective against water, and fairy cancels out the Dragon (dragon pulse). get it to learn electric and grass type moves, if you can (since the terra type is water). of course, you can use other pokemon- but these are generally the best types to use against them!
My belly drum play rough azumaril was able to beat it pretty comfortably
Can you breed these two new mons?
Why is there a past suicune when the story behind suicine is it was a vanporion  that was reszes by ho oh
Walking Wake is actually really bad, it's a Special Attack Mon that can't learn anything that boost it's Special Attack at all, Nasty Plot? Nope and Calm Mind? Also nope. But it does learn Hone Claws, Dragon Dance and Agility. So it's a special attacker that's wants to be a physical but it's physical stats are lacking.
Does anyone one know if you can get both, when for example joining your friends' raid?
Man, screw nintendo. Only 2 weeks to get stuff they should have released from the start.
Funny thing about the lag, it's because of the world not being loaded in chunks like the Pokemon
Please setup a code link I'm gonna breed so i can trade for iron leaf
Wait you can only get one? Can you trade for the other or just join a 2nd raid?
These Future Paradox Pokémon have the infinite potential of Mecha fusions….
Raids still run like dog sh!t lmao. Glitching as hell with hp bars
I just barely beat it on my first try with iron hands
I hate the fact that the good features are locked behind nintendo switch online
I used the same Lurantis raiding Walking Wake that I used with Unrivaled Pikachu
Do you think we will be able to get extras of the version exclusive once dlc comes out? I only have scarlet but I’d love an Iron Leaves too.
do u think we will get the gb and gba games
John @1:40 Its not going to be extremely difficult" ...   20 Psych Blades Later...After Swords dance 😤🤦🏾‍♂ Thanking God it was just A 5-star raid 😁😂🤷🏾‍♂
Idk how Austin John  Is able to kill this thing so easily He’s very difficult
How can you catch the other version exclusive without the game?
Still didn't get mass release tho 😐
Your math was off with Hydro Steam. it gains a 50% boost, 50% of 80 is 40, 80 + 40 = 120 base power.
Solo Iron Leaves with Metronome Fury Cutter Scizor in 5 turns
Base power of 120
I became the champion, got the latest version, and the water symbol isn't on my map.
unaware skeledirge wrecks iron leaf
One thing I’m not fully clear on, if I’m playing violet can I catch both (iron leaves from my game and walking wake from a raid hosted by a friend?)
I kept having trouble on Virizionwith randoms while buffing a Scizor and instead opted for Forretress Def/Atk. Used Ice Spinner to negate the terrain, then Reflect on the party to mitigate. Poison Jab with Poison tera for the win!
Pokémon Presents hugely disappointing, but not going to lie, these two are pretty sick. I hope I can get both easy, if I can see and join a raid of someone doing the other version (Violet)'s new Paradox Pokémon.
Can you trade them and then catch another? if you can what are the codes for it
Iron Leaves is giving me a hard time. Walking Wake was much easier
austin your bio for iron leaves says its level 100
Can u catch both
I use Kingambit on Iron Leaves
Got the violet one solo. Whoooo lol, was tough. But done. Shame my online subs expired. Shame I can't get the blue pokemon xD lol.
Bro I was so happy when I saw it was 5 and not 7 star😂
This is strange. I understand an old Pokémon or a mythical having a limited time event, but it’s a Paradox Pokemon, and we don’t even know if it’s a Legendary!
Walking Wake's move is so much better than the other one.
Trying to get the other version's raid like: "You weren't able to join. You weren't able to join. You weren't able to join. You weren't able t"
So I can catch only one? Does that mean I can’t join a scarlet raid and catch walking wake if I already have iron leaves?
Finally, swookeen can return to me
I really like these legendary‘s it’s sad though that their time limited which means if I start a new Playthru at any point after this events I won’t be able to get them😢
Iron leaves is so much harder than walking wake
i was really hoping the boxes update would load the mons faster but nope boxes are still laggy and slow
Iron Leaves took out my fire Pokémon with in 3 or 4 turns enough to make us loose.  When I used Scizor it stayed up for the whole round with out fainting.   On Walking Wake I used Cloudsier  and the OTHER members of the team KOed it before I could terestalize  and that team was the typical Iron Hands,  azumarill team up
I got a Walking Wake with different stats and nature
Im happy to say I'm factually the first person to use walking wake online
Anybody hosting scarlet raids
Got both using a level 100 dragonite
I already caught both of them, but not on their best stats! My Walking Wake has a Quiet nature, and my Iron Leaves has a Hasty nature.
Have I done something wrong? Can't find my Iron Leaves raids. I have updated my game.
I always got trouble with Iron Leaves bcuz it always spams megahorn and psyblade
When you have no more money for the membership for online…
I managed to solo Walking Wake using the Own Tempo Lilligant I used for the previous Pikachu Raid. Gave it Solar Beam to take advantage of the Sunny Day setup; After getting knocked out, I Tera-Grass and spammed Petal Dance, healing up damage using the Shell Bell. Despite having Flamethrower, for some reason, it kept on using Noble Roar.
Mine was a jolly nature
120 BP, not 140. 80*1.5.
I used Belibolt for Walking Wake and Scizor for Iron Leaf
you can definitely bring a grass type to the raid i wrecked him with a lvl100 meowscarada
I've got to get my 7 star pikachu before I try this. Walking Wake looks freaking awesome. Too bad I only have Violet.
Wudder type
Never really like event pokemon… hope these will be available in the dlc or something too
Yes please analyze the new update for performance and quality of life improvements. Im specially interested in the performance issuses
I had a raid for walking wake with mine and stranger's meowscarada just using spam Flower trick and the raid lasted less than a minute because of how much  we destroyed it.  Iron Leaves on the other hand... Though I owe my frustrations to all the jabronis bringing Iron Hands, Lucarios, Azumarills, and Scream Tails...
Another strategy you can use for Iron Leaves, is to bring a pokemon that gets rid of the electric terrain to reduce it's attack. I brought my shiny lvl 100 Weavile and used Ice Spinner to start, and got rid of the electric terrain that lowered Iron Leaves attack. Any other move to get rid of the terrain is a great strategy as well. Just wanted to out that out there
Can I get one of each?
Of the two, Iron Leaves was wayyyy harder. Even with trying to set up on it.   Walking Waves was way easier.
Damn Austin’s some miss information happening here
I might have not been looking at the video well but can we get both as long as someone else is hosting for the people who don't have both
Whoever names these things needs fired.
I dont think natures are fixed. The Walking Wake i caught was Timid, while the Iron Leaves was modest.
Just pointing out hydro steams power is only 120 under sunny day not 140
I have both of these thanks to the Terra Raid on Scarlet going to work on Violet later today
So I was able to catch both in violet. They aren't exclusive to specific games right now
I was totally able to get Walking wake solo with Meowscarada, was a bit lucky but can't complain.
Roaring moon worked very well for me against iron leaf
Easy way to solo 1-shot Walking Wake that has worked for me is max Atk Iron Hands: 1. Belly Drum (Sitrus recovery) 2. Charge (give +1 SpDef which probably isn't really needed, but helps - main thing is double your next Electric move) 3. Wild Charge  EVs (not optimal, this is just what I already had on hand): 4 HP / 252 Atk / 100 Def / 152 SpDef
Can you change the date on switch to get more of the walking wake raids I only saw 1 of those raids on my map
mine came out sassy specially stronger physically weaker overall bulkyer same speed
Hi john i think those moves are 120 damage when met those conditions. Normal power 80 damage 50%-40 damage 80+40=120
Meowscarada for me solo’d Walking Wake, it could probably solo Iron Leaf
Sooooooo refreshing and I’m SO HAPPY ! Pokémon is REALLY showing out. I LOVE this-
Is walking wake shiny locked?
YOU CAN GET BOTH WITH THE TERA RAID ONLINE
Dang, Walking Wake has Flame Thrower, I was plan on going to bring my final evolution Grass Pokemon to the Tera Raid Battle. I’ll might use the Mystery Gift Pikachu that I got from earlier instead for catching Walking Wake.
Fun fact: you pretty much nullify all their strongest strategies by taking away their Electric Terrain. Did it with Iron Leaves, and it was SO much easier to beat. 🤣
Are you using a JB switch?
Gholdengo sucks I just got one shot
The lag forest is much better now
For people playing violet, just use scizor with x-scizor and you basically win
Dat cocaine bear   They been forgetting to Button to box and botton to party for what feels like centuries now
Kingambit is amazing for iron leaves
You're right, they weren't easy to beat - at least Iron Leaves wasn't for me. I beat Walking Wake pretty easily with the usual Azumarill Belly Drum+Play Rough combination. But since I only have Scarlet, I had to play online to get the Violet version exclusive one and my Charizard stood no chance to the psychic attack. In the end I managed to catch Iron Leaves with the help of my trusty Tinkaton. :3
These both look incredible, but they definitely dropped the ball on their names
I got both of these with no issues at all, someone more or less two-shot the Scarlet one
They butcher suicune
If people have trouble against Iron Leaf for some reason  Iron defense + Swords Dance KingGambit completely counters it since it has no fighting move
so you can't capture both? if you go online with it? like if I went online with my scarlet version people from violet can't capture him and get their version too?
Not "Easy" Took out waking with one thunder punch...
when you 1 per save do you mean  1 Iron Leaves **and** 1 Walking Wake per save?  or  1 Iron Leaves **or** 1 Walking Wake per save?  It feels like the first is obviously what it is but it sounded like the second even after watching the video again.
Tried doing so many with randoms fail after fail...
I'd like to see Austin multitask a raid with 4 switches next time
I just got home from work and the thumbnail spoiled all of it, but I guess that's hype.
I soloed Walking Wake with just a Miraidon using Metal Sound until it hit 3 times on it then using Electro Drift on it. Iron Leaves on the other hand since I don't have Violet I had to join randoms and it took me 8 Iron Leaves raids until I was able to catch one.
I've finished the Pokemon League and became Champion, but Iron Leaves Tera Raid still haven't spawned on my map at all. Am I supposed to actually defeat the entire post game first?
I defeated Walking Wake first try with 2 Iron Hands. Iron Leaves took 3 tries.
kingambit with taunt seems to do wonders for ironsleaves to me
I don't want to beat the game, in case the DLC levels change like in the first SwSh DLC (also don't have time). I hope this comes out in the DLC.
Walking Wake was super easy with Iron Hands but Iron Leaves was a pain in the ass.
I iron leaves but it doesn’t show up in my boxes or in my inventory
I had a great counter pokemon for Walking Wake. Arboliva with Absorb Bulb, using Terrain Pulse, Mega Drain, Energy Ball and Leech Seed. The leech seed plus it's ability to make grassy terrain helped it to not faint even once.. granted it never used flamethrower on me.
Natures are not the same.  I got a Modest Walking Wake in my first den, and then a Brave one for my other game.  Oddly enough I managed to get two Sassy Iron Leaves from two different raids
Has anyone not been able to find its den cuz it's nowhere on my map and I'm on the latest version
I think ur method for walking wake was good but I went with drizzle peliper, because I knew that it would knock it out at least once and when it did, and came back the rain would stop it’s protosynthesis. Still can’t catch iron leaves tho :/
Use gholdengo for iron leaves. Don't expect to win easily but it's doable with luck.
They were a PAIN to catch but I eventually succeeded tip of advice for both versions I recommend you catch Iron Leaves first so that you can use it against Walking Wake to catch it since Iron Leaves has a type advantage over Walking Wake at least during it’s Terastal Raid battle anyway.
Quick question, do you need Nintendo Swtch Online for these events to be acsessible? I wan´t to get Walking Wake but i currently don´t have a NSO account
I almost flung myself out of my chair seeing Walking Wake's size 🤣
Very painful to hear that 80*1.5 is 140 twice :(
What are the stats for gholdengo?
Bulky ting-lu with shell bell did it for me in one attempt for iron leaves. Only dark type I had built for the raid.
My nature on Walking Wake is Sassy.
Lvl 100 Hypertrained Miraidon With metal sound solos Walking Wake no problem. Specifically the electric tera type Miraidon
I updated my game and it keeps saying that I weren't able to join the raid for Walking Wake
hmm I am not champ yet, is there any way I can get them too?
I beat Iron Leaves on the first try with my starter. I just alternated with Torch Song and Shadow Ball
Awesome
Not fixed btw, my Wake was Timid and my Virizion was mild.
Just confused why only 2 weeks I don’t understand that part
Iron Leaves = Kingabit:1*iron defence, 3*swords dance,1* kowtow cleave = high chance to OHKO Walking Wake = Miraidon: parabolic charge to soak up dragon pulses then terastalize and electro drift.  not everyone gets the same.
So there is a special breed of chickens in Japan that don't molt and have extremely long tail feathers. Walking wake reminds me so much of that chicken
How do you get the new clothes? Do you have to go to a store?
Did Pokémon home hit
I can’t find it on my map
11:55 That’s what she said
This actually got me super excited thank god I got both Violet and scarlet
I am kinda sad as I couldn’t get these Pokémon as I don’t have the game yet :(
great video, thank you so much Austin!
Pokemon Violet and Scarlet are by far one ruffest poke games
Is it one of the two per save file or one of each per save file?
And when you select to move a pokemon, you can go to the boxes and select which box you want to go to rather then shuffling through them one at a time
Thank you
Can you do this without Nintendo switch online?
I got Walking Wake the first try and it took like 3 attempt's to get Iron Leaf.
I tried ceruledge for iron leaves, i got close but didn't win. Going to make try other builds for sure
Is it safe to assume that these are shiny locked?
For anyone struggling with Iron Leaves. Getting rid of terrain asap is gonna be super helpful! I used my dragonite with ice spinner. Getting rid of elec terrain deactivates quark drive and 50% psyblade boost allowing you a better chance to rack up damage!
Walking Wake is so freaking cool. Absolutely my new favorite from this gen.
oh yea if u want to get both in one game just do the tera rain battle ull find both there but good luck geting in any of them took me a while my self
So when ho-oh created the cat trio did it try to recreate this suicune but made a different one
This game isn’t really that good ngl
Slowbro is really good against walking wake
Can i try the Raid before completing the game? u.u
walking wake only took me a few mints to get on the other hand the other took me 10 mints to get
I wonder what happens when u don't catch it in time
My Iron Leaves was quiet nature and destroyed it with Annihilape and rage fist
Guess they are considered Paradox Legendaries so them being more difficult checks out
6:20 half of 80 is 40, so it's 120.
I would be happy for the to make boxes instant again in exchange for the old sprites
Hi all, I'm looking for someone to help me capture ironleaves. you can help me?
Walking Wake was pretty easy and I solo'd with Meowscarada before I knew it had flamethrower
You probably got lucky with getting both Walking Wake's being relaxed. Mine turned out to be Jolly.
6 time 6 fail i hate raids
I broke my switch lites screen and just gave it for repair   It will take around 4 days and thank god this raid is for 2 weeks cuz I almost had a mini heart attack thinking it’s only two days like the usual raids
What is with these names did they just give up??
I need you guys to tell me, do I need an active nintendo online subscription to catch this or can I do it solo with no online sub?
Lemme save you some time -  Suicune Walking Wake - pokemon with Defiant (Annihalape or Kingambit is easy), or good ol Azumarril but it might take awhile Verizon Iron Leaves - Chi Yu (immune to Psyblade, can Will o wisp to burn and reduce attack, and resists its other two attacks)
Yo these people suck I've already lost twice online bout to lose a 3rd because the host is using a moushold wtf
Walking Wake is the new Tatusigiri Game Freak You made a Big Mistake It suppost to be grass and steel
Nature isn't fixed at all. My Walking Wake was docile with different IVs and my Iron Leaves is different than yours.
So is it possible for Violet players to join a scarlet raid for the respective new paradox and vice versa?
So you can only catch one of the two or both if a scarlet player hosts for a violet player?
i can't wait for gen 10 where 70 of the pokemon either have a dumb evolution method, force you to use a bad gimmick or the big one require you to play online in a game where most people play solo.
Not to be a nerd, but your math is wrong. 50% of 80 isn't 60, it's 40, making Hydro Steam's base power 120, not 140.
I got a calm Walking Wake with 4 perfect IVs.
Bro walking wake looks so cool!!! WHY DID I CHOOSE VOILET
I caught a Walking Wake from a hosted den and I lucked out. Mine was a bold nature with all six IVs maxed. The Iron Leaves in my den and another's hosted den had four maxed IVs and were different.
I used iron hands to win the ancient one immediately, took less than 5 minutes
I’m confused? People are saying version exclusive but I was able to get both on my scarlet game.
Mmm can someone explain to me how a “past suicune” is a thing? Like, I understand “future virizion” (somehow) but wasn’t Suicune a creation of Ho-oh AFTER they all die not so long ago? Like, this Suicune looks like literally came from a Jurassic Era.
80+50%=120
Iron leaves was definitely harder. Took about five tries to get it. Mostly because I didn’t know what to use. I used kingambit as well but I still struggled. I was not able to solo it and we barely made it. Walking Wake got it on the first try with a defiant Annihalape with two other people using iron hands and a Miraidon.
By the way my walking wake is not  relaxed it's impish so relaxed is not fixed
Can you get more than one
4 what?! 4 gym leaders or the Pokémon bosses?! Please I need to know
I was lucky and beat WW first go with my sylveon. But Iron leaves is tough! Lost against it 5 times so far lol.
I did iron hands for suicune and chiyu for iron leaves
I've seen a lot of people talking about how the paradox pokemon are different from the sketches... Perhaps something was changed in the past or future when the professor did what they did (trying to not say spoilery stuff)? Or maybe Heath didn't get to complete the sketches and therefore had to take liberties based off the pokemon he believed they resembled?
found it pretty cool that you caught the walking wake at the crytal cavern because the original form is the box legendary for pokemon crystal.
Hey I got a question about the new legendary, I haven't finished the game and beat 3 gym, 2 titans, and 2 star.  Would i be able to still catch them
I really wish i got scarlet and got chonky suicune Now I'll just get green deer
okay for competitive wise. (i know austin is not much in the competitive battling but maybe someone els can help me out) is it better to do walking wake with specs + timid nature? or modest with max speed/sp att? or dow i go something in between where i try ti make the gap between sp att and speed as minimum as possible with speed having the upper hand to maximize dmg and speed without being locked to 1 move with specs? so many options
Arboliva with light screen and clear amulet. Light screen turn 1, flamethrower does almost nothing
So this is just a new Pokémon, the dog trio was made when 3 Pokémon were stuck in bell tower and hooh revived them as the dog trio. Suicune doesn’t have a past form cause it didn’t exist in the past
hope they will fix the box speed because damn it is still horrible
I had a quiet nature walking wake
Kingambit was clutch for Iron Leaves. Meowscarada was nice for Walking Wake.
A lot of people online are saying how hard the raids are, but I was able to catch both within about 15 mins of the event going live on first try in my games.   Iron Leaf went down to ghost Terra annihilape with screech and rage fist and Walking Wake went down to the same Lurantis build I was using for Pikachu - flamethrower hurt but it was nothing that synthesis couldn't get back (since it throws up sunny day anyway), and even if you drop once just Tera after the first drop and hit it with leaf storm 4x and you win
Not fixed
Can I catch walking wake as a Violet player if I join a Scarlet player's raid? Also, is Azumarill good for this raid?
The natures and IVs for these pokemon are not preset; they're random, like other five star raids. This isn't like a seven star raids where their parameters are preset.  IVs are in the same range as what is present with most five star raids. So several max IVs, but not guaranteed to be all of them.
Can you catch one of each? Or is it one or the other?
Love walking wake. He's a cute creepy raptor ludroth thing.
9:43⛳🏌‍♂️
Hey! I’ve got a question. I’ve made sure my game updated to the newest version, everything seems right. I load the game and start looking for the raid and it’s not there.. any help would be greatly appreciated!
Walking wake looks great
I beated walking wake with a level 71 Meowscarada
Editing Austin is my spirit animal
Nature's are not fixed, they are random
The moves are actually 120 base power in the Sun/Electric Terrain. 80 x 50% is 40, not 60
I caught both in pokemon violet
I solo'd Iron Leaves with Annihilape because it kept using Leaf Blade instead of the the super effective ultra strong move
Austin your math is slightly off. 50% of 80 is 40, not 60. 80 + 40 is 120 base power.
So as a violet player I cannot get Walking Wake without trading, correct?
I have Scarlet and I caught Iron Leaves by joining a Violet raid after 3 attempts using Gholdengo,  so Gholdengo is the best pokemon to counter Iron Leaves
Still want mass release for boxes for it to be perfect
I'm starting to regret my choice on violet
kind of disappoint in waking appearance.....was hoping that he will be an older vision and more majestic vision of the original
What's the setup for Gholdengo?
I've found my main water type 😍😍😍
Bp of signature moves is 120 after boost, not 140. Love your videos though! ❤
Hey can someone help me? I keep resetting my map and when I look for the raid , it doesn't show up
I am playing violet and I am wondering if I join a scarlet raid can I get Walking Wake?
nice video. it I don't have the games yet damn
Great in rain and sun pretty dope
WAit u cant catch both????
Kinda sad these are shiny locked. I would've loved to try and get a shiny Iron Leaves
They're definitely setting up for a fire 🔥 water 💧 type pokemon with all these scolding type moves 🤔👌
This is why Scarlet is better, the designs of the Pokemon are new unlike Violet where it just says let us make them into robots and change nothing.
I got him using iron hands with belly drum then thunder punch x2 then used drain punch until finished sense he will have that energy guard
kinggambit with sword dance, irondance foulplay and kowtow cleave was great for the iron leaf raid,. set up defense and then up atk then kotow or foul play and bingo bongo easy raid. as long as the others in your raid dont mess it up
Heh. I brought Arboliva since I saw it kept setting up the sun. I survived and set up with growth... it was a wrap 😂
Are they shiny locked?
I love the irony of using charizard for the water dragon, and using fluttermane for the grass psychic. That really made my day 🤣
I used the exact same WoChein build from the Pikachu raids, tera grass with Giga Drain and Covert Cloak (can use different item)
I can confirm that iron leaves is amazing in raids. Swords dance leaf blade 1 shot walking wake.
Used Annihilape solo.
You think a dark Tera Greninja would work well Virizion?
r u able to go online and catch the opposite mon even if u caught your version?
No gba games for switch tho?
They really need a patch that solely focus on all the raid issues have online iron leaves raid was horrible ended up waiting three minutes just for the game to load all the sound effects for attacks and the release of energy sound after being kicked out on screen and this was after updating the latest patch.
Can I get an Iron Leaves and Walking Wake on th same save file?
Kingambit worked pretty well against Iron Leaves for me.
Since I don’t have violet will I just have to trade until I get iron leaves?
Yeah I'm playing scarlet and just got grass type I'm confused
Wait you ask for box changes and mass delete wasn't one of them?! I'm disappointed truly
Walking Wake is an massive adorable dinosaur
L event
Do you guys know if you need nintendo online to access the raids, I am a bit confused and would like to get these paradox pokemon before the time is up.
My monkey boy one shot him with two bulk ups
Miraidon with Electric Tera is also really good at taking down Walking Wake. With max SP.ATK and max HP EVs, he can easily tank even Dragon Pulse with a Charge or two, which backloads his damage but keeps Walking Wake from dealing absurd damage. If you are solo, you can spam Parabolic Charge until you terastallize . If you're in a group, spam Charge Beam instead and cap off with a Heal Cheer if/when needed. Once Terastallized, use Charge then Electro Drift and he'll fall over easy
Kingsgambit for the win against Iron Leaves.
I ran clear amulet gardevoir with thunderbolt calm mind electric Tera type For walking wake  Mirror or shell bell Kingambit for iron leaves
Great Stuff!
When you didn’t read the fine print and ended up using both your code for one game and was only able to get one Zoroark instead of two. 🤬😑😢
"Quash" "What's that?!"   Hahahahaha idk but the way you said that made me laugh loud lol
Anyone know if you can do a raid search and find someone posting the other version's exclusive and then join that to get the other one?
so version exclusive- so I can't just like, boot up my copy os Violet and join a raid someone is hosting in their copy of Scarlet, and catch Walking Wake that way?
To echo the other comments - nature and stats are different but got alucky modest wake
Anyone wanna trade a Roaring Moon For a IronHands?  I need iron hands I’m on scarlet
Are walking wake and iron leaves free
Can we join online to catch the other version exclusive?
Austin I'm looking forward to your guide on connecting to Pokemon GO!
How about naming pokemon I hate their new half ass names
You’re super late on this, lame asf
These paradox pokemon are underwhelming compared to the drawings in the game
A totally underrated pokemon I'm not seeing but am using is Bellibolt. Lovely pokemon for the suicune.
I don't know, but I feel like Walking Wake looks like a noc off fusion of kuraidon and kommo-o or helioptile. It's designed is kinda meh in my eyes. I was thinking paradox suicune would have look similar to drampa or heck shenron from DBZ. Virizion it's ok.
I love future Austin
So right after the pokemon direct, I went to the poke portal  and did the update to get the walking waves. I went to the water Den and instead of it being walking wake, it was an egg with the normal type. My game is currently going through the whole update process but I see absolutely no one talking about this egg that was in the den. The egg has a teal colored pokeball attached to it.
Thanks so much Austin for the tutorial when I saw Walking walks I knew I need to have one, thank you so much for the tutorial, but here is a question do 5-star raids appear before you battle nemona after becoming champion or 5-star raids come after you beat nemona and become champion?
I’m so satly I don’t have scarlet yet walking wake looks so awesome I probably won’t be able to get it 🥲
I did both with Miraidon
I grinded my violet for charizard event… now I gotta grind my scarlet for this new suincune
Guess I have 2 weeks to get a bunch of Pokémon to level 100 from 70 ish
I think when we transfer school to blueberry it gonna be like a battle tournament
I used anialape
For Scarlet players, Azumarill ( Charizard build ) can be used too. I beat Walking Wake first try easily.
I can not believe that they finally listed the exact percentage of a move's effect in game.
50% of 80 isn’t 60
If I’m understanding this correctly.. They’re version exclusives, but I’d be able to join a raid hosted by the alternative game to catch the other paradox?
Got the DLC pre-ordered. The eShop dates for the releases are 31DEC23 for part 1 and 30APR24 for part 2. They usually over estimate just in case?
so like I one shot walking wake with miraidon by just using charge and electro drift, also one shot iron leaves with a shadow ball from gholdengo and 3 nasty plots
i just my azumarill for both raids and it was really good especially against the walking wake
I'm confused? I defeated iron leaves first try with gholdengo, nasty plot and shadow ball. sorry if I sound a little rude I'm not trying to be
Do I need to have nintendo live to encounter them?
You can only catch them once and the item glitch is patched. Before you updated get rid of your duped legendary or else you will be stuck with it forever in your party. I messed up by not getting rid of it before updating.
it def runs smoother and didn't notice a difference of amount of mons but maybe a diff in how they are distributed in the area
Haven’t watched the full video yet but are they shiny locked?
Not everyone gets the same walking wake… I caught a modest one …
Is Iron Hands and Ghouldengo the only good options? I have Scarlet and am far from 999 coins
Virizion is hard to get simply because  I'm on scarlet so I can't just solo it. Every host is AWFUL.
I just used meowscarda for both. It worked perfectly
so in order to get one in violet we will have to get friend to link trade with us ?
I want the suicune more than verizion. However I only have violet. Sad Times
I used Meowscarada on the Suicune and beat it easily
"Quash, what's that?"  Tell me you have never played VGC without saying you've never played VGC XD  I'm just having fun! Lol. Thanks for the info on this!
Can you catch both in one game if you find the raids in PokePortal?
Today Austin taught me 50% of 80 is 60 🤯
Using a future paradox pokemon against a past paradox pokemon: Future on Past violence.
Is Austin John using CFW? His homescreen background is pure black which I don't believe is possible without CFW and themezer
Can someone clarify something: Am I to understand that in these raids each trainer can only have ONE OF THE TWO or is it ONE OF EACH?
I wish they weren't in raids I hate the new raids 😥
Sylveon worked for me with Iron Leaves. Set up misty terrain and reflect then dropped its attack a few times with charm before helping hand-ing someone's Kingambit. Hope this helps someone!
Hate to be that guy, 80 +40 = 120
I took on Walking Wake with Arboliva, caught me off guard with flamethrower but my olive Reith was tanky enough to take it
I one shot my Walking Wake with Miraidon on what should be a test run 🥳
Waking Wake runs on water like lore accurate Suicune!!!
i want to see how terapagos looks in game
Use Meowscarada for P Suicune and Goldhengo for P Virizion   Easy
I was able to catch both pokemon on one game, so yea, you can have both of them in one game, even if you only brought just pokemon scarlet or violet
What is the level star of the raid?
My walking wake is bashful, it's just cos you did it with 2 in the same den
Can you get the other legendary if invited to a raid from the other game version like previous raids?
That Suicune form better be available in the DLC because I want Walking Wake so bad! I dont have the new gen game yet and wont be able to get it for a while.
Will the event come back again after the two weeks?
Damn austin is pumping out the update rapidly fast
Austin... 50% more of 80 is 120, not 140 lol...
I beat iron leaves with kinggambit
they are NOT fixed. My Walking Wake was Jolly. My Iron Leaves was actually modest.
“Don’t bring a grass type” I beat him with Meowscarada 😅
What changes when the dlc comes as far as the amount of times we can capture it? You made that comment and I don’t understand sorry.
I got insanely lucky if the natures are random. First Iron Leaves I found and caught after the Presents had an Adamant nature. I’m super excited to use this in raids now  Thanks for the guide AJP!
All you need to win sucuine is iron hands and gholdengo for virizion
Surprisingly, the Hisuian Zoroark from DLC preorder gift code is quite good counter on Iron Leaves. Bitter Malice is super effective on Psychic and decrease the Att. on oponnent. 252 Sp Att and Spd, with Wise Glasses and Modest Nature Will do just fine!!!
Can you catch both once on 1 save or one or the other?
Great video as always! You’re the guy I always look to when a new S/V event comes out.   I haven’t tried the Iron Leaves raid out yet but Walking Wake was incredibly easy for me. I used my Miraidon that was built for special attack and easily OHKO’d it after 3 metal sounds plus throat spray boosted electro drift
I brought meowscarada (LV100) And beat it first try with my friends so wake wasn't hard, the venison pie (Virizon) is harder... What was the goldengo build?
I like how at the end Iron Leaves was going bat sh!t in the background and Walking Wake was just like IDGAF and snoozin. Love the contrast. Also, hes a BIG BOI!
Miraidon does great against walking wake when given a shell bell.
Still don't have mass release i see
Why did they limit these paradox pokemon to 1 catch per save?
My walking wake is naughty
I'd say two weeks right now... But when DLCS are out I'm sure you can catch em..
Appreciate the work you do!
I got a different one. Everyone isn’t getting same one
Unfortunately, I have scarlet so I have to use online to get Iron Leaves. Which wouldn't be to bad if I didn't keep getting matched up with people using Iron Hands into a Psychic Terra Pokemon. I swear people don't actually know what types are
Did they fix azumaryl huge power?
Walking wake was easy for me but iron leaf keeps sweeping me
Only one catch?! Lame
Can confirm it is very possible to defeat Walking Wake solo with the Clodsire setup used for Pikachu. 6 Curses, 3 Earthquakes, Terastylize and go ham with Earthquakes. It is a close battle even with a Level 100, Max Attack EV, Hyper-Trained mon but it’s doable. I had no Intimidate mons and no Arboliva.  Haven’t done Iron Leaves yet.
Dude idk why the violet one was so much harder. It was 1 shotting me EVERY time
There is no way your raid timer for iron leaves is this slow, I battled this Pokémon 6 times and each time after 2-3 turns, the time literally ran out with it still having full health 😡🤬🤯
Also do I have to beat the game that get to the Terra raids
so is the pikachu 7* coming back after these guys leave?
Nature is random. I did both raid with friend and they had two different natures.
I can't find it, I have 5 star raids available and I've looked everywhere
I got Iron leaves Bold nature
Managed to catch Walking Wake on my first try using my lvl 96 playthrough Meowscarada spamming Flower Trick. Was paired with a Haxorus, Corvinight and an Arboliva. The timer ran out just as I took my last move and caught it with a Lure Ball :)
Can anyone help me answer the question up can I get both
this is absolutely terrible. looks like an Arctozolt dressed as a Suicune. freak of absolute nature
As much as I liked Violet, the Scarlet paradoxes are so much cooler.  The Violet paradoxes are so… boring.
I love them both but I do love Iron Leaves a bit more visually.
I'm not loving this live service approach to the game this gen. Why can't these Pokemon just be available for me to catch in the game I paid for when I feel like getting to them? This FOMO approach to stuff really detracts from the game for me.
I took down Iron Leaves with my level 100 Kingambit with NPCs. It was pretty easy.
it also surprised me when I saw how big Walking Wake was. I thought it'd be way smaller.
80 base power, gets boosted by 50%... That's 80+40, not 80+60. 120 base power for both of the new moves.
When does this start?.. :)
I got a jolly walking wake, dont think natures are locked
Got the grass one but waiting till newr end date to catch the water as farming pikachu raid still
I'm disappointed and it's not far too People who just recently started playing the game which I'm not even close to the Elite Four at all!😢👇  This isn't fair! I'm going to be battling against the Normal Type Gym Leader Larry, 2 Members of Team Star to take down and once I defeat Larry I will be battling against the Ground Titan!  There's not enough time to do this in just two weeks what a completely letdown!
How do you get 140 on those moves? I could be wrong but 80*1.5=120 for stab, 120*1.5=180 for condition
Do I need Nintendo Online to get Walking Wake?
Definitely adding these to my Team. I need the shinier though
I ran a support purrserker on iron leaves cause it kept sweeping. i ran taunt and  chilling water and a goldhengho and kingambit did the damage. i feel like these raids are easier solo.
Lvl 100 Arboliva with giga drain can solo this ez. For those of you who are having a hard time. you can also have growth and petal dance for the end after the shield. if you want to ev just do max SP atk and HP. Ez mode. Good luck and HAVE FUN! For Walking Wake!
Walking wake looks nowhere near as cool as the scarlet book pokemon
What are the stats of this Gholdengo?
this raid requires DLC purchase?
The Lurantis I made for Pikachu decimated Walking Wake.
When you have Violet but the Scarlett exclusive is for the first time better than the violet ( my opinion )
I'm guessing that we will have the other 2 of each trio have their own paradox and your fuse all 3 pokemon from each trio to get the paradox that is in scarlet/violet book
Best pokemon for Iron Leaves is Scisor with following move set Fury Cutter Swords Dance Iron Defense X Scissor / Focus Energy  Miraidon is good vs Walking Wake Parabolic Charge Metal Sound Draco Meteor / Dragon Dance Electro Drift  I have solo'd these multiple times with these pokemon and have easily solo'd random raids for players as well easily.
Walking wake really question if the paradox pokemon is really a past pokemon since the legendary dog was a pokemon created by ho-oh through dead eevelution so not that far past to where walking wake to exist.
Can a Violet player join a Scarlett player's Walking Wake raid, and vice versa for Iron Leaves??
Say If I catch iron leaves, can I be able to catch the other one or can I get both in one save file
Love the videos man! Just a heads up… the 50% buff on the signature moves make them 120 power, not 140.
How is there a prehistoric suicune when it was created in gen 2?
since you have two switches and can trade between them, can you see if Walking Wake can be traded and then caught again since it is no longer in your game?
I just used Ceruledge with Will-o-wisp and Clear Smog against Iron Leaves. Worked out pretty well
Thanks for the how-to Now if only I could find a reason why I would _want_ to...
Yeah they aren't the same pokemon. Because I've used Kingambit and Foul Play took out half its hp in one battle and then barely anything in others.
I just want to give a quick warning to everybody, that is doing these once you catch one of the Pokémon always save because I was trying to get iron leaves and it crashed my game so I really want to give everybody a warning that your game might crash and you must save your game. If you catch one of these Pokémon or both so you don’t lose them
If u trade the pokemon away, would u be able to catch it again?
I wonder what would future coballion be called.
ahh tysm for these videos and good to know i have time to finish my new playthrough of scarlet in order to get Walking Wake in Scarlet :D
Ruined my guy suicune
Ya my walking wake was quirky natured and im assuming you got the 140 total from the stab for hydro steam
I updated the game but i'm still only seeing 7 Star Pikachu raids, does anyone know why?
Leaving a tip for those wanting to SOLO Iron Leaves: Use Scizor! Iron Defense, Swords Dance, maybe Focus Energy if you really need it and either X-Scissor or Fury Cutter while holding a Shell Bell. Trust me you'll need it. A defensive nature preferably Impish or Lax use a mint if necessary you are going to need all of the defense you got. You can invest or choose not to invest and setup until you are ready to begin attacking. It won't wash away your stats and ability until after 8 turns have passed. Good luck out there!
i unfortunately got an adamant walking wake for mine :'D
Hydro steam and Psyblade will be 120 base power, not 140. The 50% boost will be 40, not 60.
Btw moridon is good agans iron leaves
I used Kingambit with swords dance, iron defense, kowtow cleave and night slash and did not have a problem with Iron Leaves
He's enormous!  Also a sleepy boy 🤣
What have they done to suicune????
ngl hoping we can shiny hunt them when dlc drops cause something tells me there shinies are gonna be perfect.
Annihilape melted iron leaves. It didn't even Tera.
I died once to each, i felt dumb. Brought Iron hands to Walking Wake and Annihilape to Iron Leaves. Annihilape not the best choice forgot about the fighting but still took it out with Rage Fist.
Wish you could catch more than one...
Post-John is best John no cap. 😂
I've got a question Can I catch one of each If I have Violet can I get the Violet exclusive then join my friends Scarlet and get the scarlet exclusive Or can I only catch one
How tf is your homepage theme pitch black?
Iron leafs he is so annoying
Would be possible to catch both with only one game through look for raid feature?
That thumbnail is phenomenal. Best one yet
Can I join Walking Wake raids hosted by Scarlet?
The ai is weird, I brought an arboliva and he did a couple of water beam and noble roared the hell out of me.. not once he did used flamethrower 🥴
love that this was front and center when i woke up today instead of the actual direct
I beat Walking Wake on my first try solo using Leafeon. It took me down on the last turn but the AI team finish it off.
Already got Iron Leaves on first try with Annihilape, I even forgot to bring my Leftovers for it. I was lucky to get the CPU partner with Arboliva which used Grassy Terrain and nullified Iron Leaves' Electric Terrain, although TBH I don't think it mattered that much, considering my Annihilape had Bulk Up that boosted both it's Atk and Def, so it would've manage to deal with Psyblade pretty well regardless. Anyway, Iron Leaves is really cool, and so is Walking Wake. Gonna use Iron Leaves in a future team for sure.
my walking wake's nature and base states are different
My walking wake is gentle so doubt it's fixed to relax.
I'm glad that these are 5 star raids instead of 7. The 7's are annoying to win, even with optimized mons.
I soloed Iron Leaves w Annihilape, and co-opd Wake w Meowscarada, defeated Wake 2 times, second time got lucky and it didnt use a Single Fire Type move, but w Shell Bell Flower Trick Meowscarada gets decent sustain
I mean the game still runs at an embarrassing frame rate so there's that
That’s wild I battled walking wake a few times and he never lowered my stats. Seems to be a random setup it’s using in battle.
You can catch both:)
I've got 2 beast balls 🙌
is this shiny unlocked??
Austin John Is The Best 🙌🏾
you're wrong about the classics in last week's videos. what you saw was a fan made announcements
You'd think you'd remember from farming 6 iv dittos that people in the same den get the same pokemon.
Now what is tbe best ball? Beast maybe
Walking Wake walks on water…
Anybody know if you can get both by joining someone’s raid that has the opposite version?
Wait, what? only 2 weeks to get those pokemmon?
I was able to beat walking wake with Slowbro build you showed us !
I thought these were version exclusive. I just caught both in the same game Violet
Personally, I used a Shell Bell Flutter Mane for Walking Waves and a Rocky Helmet Corvoknight for Iron Leaves.  Both just shrug off any and all damage. Flutter Mane rips WW a new one as it sets up with Calm Mind, and Corvoknight breaks down IL with chip damage while using Roost to heal off any minor bits of damage that come its way.
Does anyone know if you could join a tera raid battle for the pokemon opposite to the one in your game and catch it?
Went into an iron leaves fight for first time. We all chose perfect counters to what we expect to fight, all very strong pokemon too. It uses sword dance turn one, then proceeds to one shot each of us. Was hilarious!
Used Leafeon with Shell Bell and surprisingly tanked those Flamethrowers
For Iron Leaves you can just use Swords dance Kowtow cleave Tera Dark Kingambit since Dark is immune to Psychic
I got a quirky one
I just destroyed iron leaves with skeledirge. Not ev trained or anything, and I just spammed torch song.
My internet is total trash. Trying to update the game right now and it's saying it'll take 2 and a half hours...it's been saying that for the last 40 minutes 🫠
If i catch a Walking Wake, and then invite a friend with Violet to join another raid, can they then still catch their Walking Wake?
Yeah, good luck to anybody who catches it. I’ve already had five encounters with it and I’ve failed to catch it it’s ass.
lol imagine picking pokemon violet
I don’t know if the update affects overworld spawns, but the game seems to run smoother for me.
Man they see me shinin’, Like I got the charm Stay strapped got that jet ball in my palm, Fell from the sky, guess I’m the chosen one And if you need to know how check out Austin John! Choppy and flow flow, Yeah, I got that, choppy and flow flow
For some reason, it is not letting me participate in their raids. Like, I have already downloaded the update and everything. But I can't see any of these raids on my map. Furthermore, when I try to access the PokePortal to join one of their raids, it doesn't allow me to saying there was a communication error because there is an issue with one of the Pokemon in my party. And it is only their raid; none other. I've already restarted the game, turned the console on an off, connected and disconnected from the internet, changed all of the Pokemon in my party, but nada. Does anyone know what is going on?
If a player doesn’t have Gholdengo, I used Kingambit to great success. Taunt turn 1 so it doesn’t set up, sword dance x3, then cleave pretty much is a one shot
i was able to beat iron leaves with unaware skeledirge i had shell bell and used torch song, hex, and will o wisp
I just want to shiny hunt iron leaves
I don't know if this helps anyone, but I used an SD Scizor with Pounce for Iron Leaves and my Vaporeon from the Greninja raid with calm mind and stored power, holding a clear amulet.
Man my iron hands is not near in health
Suicune looks incredible. But doesn't it having an ancient form invalidate the lore that was given it in gen 2?
Now this is what I want to see from these events. Not Pokemon I already have that drop prizes I don't even want or need
I like the designs but I was hoping more of sabertooth tiger desig
Can you join an Iron Leaves raid from Pokémon Scarlet or a Walking Wake raid from Pokémon Violet to get both paradox forms with only one game?
The Clodsier and Kingambit  was pretty easy to run with.
Gholdengo is the best Mon for Iron Leaves hands down, and I got lucky with no Dragon Pulse usage, but Miriadon is great for Wake with the standard kit
I don't know if this helps anyone but I defeated walking wake with Miraidon pretty easy. He never used the dragon type move
I'm actually relieved to see they are only 5 star raids. I've been really slow with the post game and training Pokemon, so I don't want to struggle a lot to get the new Pokemon. Walking Wake looks awesome!
I used leafstorm contrary lurantis to get walking wake
Use Lokix for Iron Leaves. You’re guaranteed an attack drop with lunge and you’ll always out-speed it. Plus if you use Tera dark psyblade won’t affect it and same goes for you dont. If you use Tera bug you’ll get hit with it but Tera boasted lunge with a guaranteed attack drop even through shield means you’ll pretty much solo it
The only thing I got for the update was a drifting controller and I can’t trade anymore
A water pokemon that gets better in the sun is shocking to me.
Friend Ball Iron Leaves :)
I have a question is there a certain way to build the gholdengo and iron hands I’m not good with this type of stuff any suggestions would be much appreciated thanks
Has the Pokémon home update been announced yet?
I used swords dance and kowtow cleave Kingambit for Iron Leaves, managed to solo it my first try!
Hey John, I’m trying to get the Hisuian Zoroark Mystery Gift but I never got the code, I purchased the DLC and everything! Yet I never got the email. What should I do?
Ah, so both versions of the game can get both if they just participate in online raids hosted by the other version of the game.
I missed Pikachu but definitely catching these two. Already got Walking Wake using Iron Hands but no item on him so that kinda sucked but I still beat it
So I can only have one of these on one save file?
Can Scarlet players join a raid for Iron Leaves and get it that way? And vice versa for Violet players?
It's not to difficult. I was able get the suicune paradox on first try with iron hands
Y did suicune have to look like a dinosaur Y😭😭
Beat both, solod iron leaves with ceruledge and beat walking wake with azumaril
Thank you Austin!
Walking Wake debunks the eevee myth, because now we know what suicune looked like before Ho-oh revived them. Can’t wait to see Entei!!
So is the DLC available in stores now or when does it come at the stores??
I am very upset Gen 1, 2, and 3 weren't announced
I got 2 of  both good god it was a bit annoying  (2 switch consoles) it’s not nature locked I caught my second one with a quirky nature and both my console s are hack free
I managed to solo Iron with my Chi Yu, but it was quite clutch. It’s got quite a lot of coverage with mega horn, leaf blade and psyblade, and likes to sword dance a lot. I also noticed the timer is really, REALLY strict in this raid. Like, one of the worst I’ve ever seen.
Unsure if you meant to say 60 or it was an accident, but its base 80 so... 80(Base) + [80*.5=40] (Sunboost) = 120 + [120*.5=60] (STAB) = 180. Not really sure how you got the +60 for 140.
I cached my walking wake in first 3 minutes after they were realisted
Didn’t the swap items already work before the update?
Can confirm, you are able to get one of EACH pokemon per copy of the game 👌
Is it one of each kind or can you only get one of them.
I'm just glad I can traverse Casseroya lake without the game becoming a powerpoint presnetation.
I just did Charge with Miraidon and then it's signsture move and ohko Suicune
Now... can people who haven't beaten the game and gotten end credits still get these is my question? Like, will they only be available this one time, and that's it?
Got Walking Wake first try with an online group. Iron Leaves?! Omg so hard. I’m still working on it. I’ve tried at least six different Pokémon.
Bro. Where did you get that drip
The idle animation for Iron Leaves is so unnerving... it has to be the only pokemon that looks like a fricking statue. I hope so much that it's a bug...
Violet players getting shafted. Just plain psychic type and barely looks any different from the original. Meanwhile Scarlett gets a water/dragon type that looks super cool and unique.
every returning pokemon was leaked austin. im so happy
How could they butchered suicune? LMFAO I dont think Id even wanna get that ugly thing.
New update? Pokemon now always go to your back?
um hate to break it to ya but the pokemons nature isn't fixed i checked my walking wake & it had a quirky nature so they are random it just falls on to RNG
So Suicune goes from being a dog species to a water dragon type species interesting
Gonna update my game now I was still on 1.0.1 because I was duping Items with a glitch
That edit at the 8 minute mark was perfection
i can't seem to find iron leaves and walking wake raids
I beat it first try solo with a azumaril.   And for violet I solod it first try with a lvl98 Un ev/iv trained ceruledge.   Not difficult. But fun Pokémon with good designs
I was reading the stats on the spreadsheet and thought it was its base stat total and i about shat myself lol
Will we be able to get these paradox mons in the dlc or just in these raids?
Isn't 80*1.5 120?
Trusty Gholdengo came in clutch for both
Not everyone has a Gholdengo. Virizion is very OP with Electric Terrian active and Swords Dance. Megahorn will kill you with both ATK stats boots up on him. I've seen raiders use Dark type Pokemon to try and take him out his attack needs to go down so Chilling Water can be useful.
How is the Dlc pay to play considering the base game 😐
can you do the iron leaves raid in scarlet if you find it in the tera raid menu and vice versa?
I got both of them through the Poke Portal raids so you don't need both games to get them both.
Mine was naughty nature
I just brought my dlc
I was gonna wait to finish the game with the dlc, but man, they really streched the release
Do you need to buy the DLC or need Nintendo Online to get these two Pokémon?
Hydro Steam is a water move that gets stronger in sunlight since you asked the question.
Time gated content doesnt exist to me 🤣
I beat Paradox Virizion with Annihilape with 4 bulk ups and 1 rage fist, but since I have to play with randoms for Walking Wake, I've failed like 8 attempts so far lol
Do we know if these will come back? I just got the game, I won't be able to get these in time unfortunately
Make sure to update your game before attempting to catch one of these, guys. Or you'll end up like me,  tera raiding a "bad egg", thinking that it's a rare encounter but actually catching a corrupted version of Walking Wake/Iron Leaves that you'll never be able to use or even re-capture after the game auto-saves 😞
I used pawmot lv 100 had no best stats hyper training all with a clear amulet so noble roar didn't affect it. Used gholdengo with leftovers for iron leaves. Neither took too long
I used my mighty Pikachu to beat that thing
We have to wait till December for the DLC?!?!?
I found Skeledirge (best with Unaware ability) and Meowscarada to be valid options to handle these new pokemon if you are tight on exp candy: Meowscarada's Flower Trick bypasses Walking Wake's Noble Roars with each hit beina a crit. Skeledirge can tank leaf blade and psyblade, stat sp. att. per torch song, and unaware ability helps with the swords dances it does as well
Boxes I never had in issue with them lol. Guess I was a bit lucky.
I know they will probably come back again. But I hate when they make non mythicals limited time events. Like come on… on a positive note: thanks for uploading! Always come to you for latest Pokémon news as well as help in games :)
Just to make sure the math is correct 80 time 1,5 is not 140 it is 120 (80 x 50% = 40) tell me if I am missing something
My game is not smoother! I'm driving about and the lag is ridiculous
I dont know, i just used my level 100 Krookodile from my base playthrough and destroyed iron leaves.
For the iron leaves raid, a good pokemon I found is a chi-yu with taunt, nasty plot, and dark pulse, using taunt to prevent it from sweeping with swords dance, then boosting and taking it out in 3-4 hits.
O play Scarlet and i managed to face and capture both of them I thought they were versión exclusives
Can I help my brother who is playing on violet catch it if I’m on scarlet?
I got walking waves first try did not even set up shied iron leaves took me like 4 tries
Could a lv 74 dragapult be ok for iron leaves?
Noone talking about this in videos. Can you catch both new pokemon or only your game one? Like can i catch my verizion in my game and join a multiplayer and catch the scarlet one?
I just sent my Annihilape against the Walking Wake. Kinda just wrecks anyway.
Great a timed event when I'm stuck in hospital
God I hate raids. Why were they the main gimmick which stayed from 8 to 9? So dull, slow, repetitive, and also means that pokemon was able to drop these two with basically zero effort or interest - here’s two new pokemon! Go catch them in a random raid den like you would any old mon >:/
i just got the game. I dont expect to unloc 5 stars.....these i hope just get released in dlc
A great Pokémon to use for Iron Leaves is Gholdengo. It was fantastic
Iy was harder to get into the raids online than the actual raids were
Just another reason why Scarlet Paradoxes are way better
Would be doing it rn but apparently downloading the update somehow messed up my sd card
10:56 Oh, so just like.....  No it is worse. The only good Electric terain setter is banned, the other move has an additional bonus in sun, psychic moves are not very good since Steel and Dark types are popular.
Man I don’t know if I should build him for Raids or Competitive
So as always players are being assholes during the raids, they bring Walking Wake to Iron Leaves battle, or Zoroark....or even worse Azumarrill, it's a mess, players really don't know how to play cooperatively and just spam moves
for iron leaves, its also usefull to use kinggambit,
If you snooze you lose!
I don't think the Nature is fixed. I got a Jolly Nature Walking Wake (Don't have Iron Leaves yet)
The Hisuian Zoroark is quite good for iron leaves if you have it. Dark tera type and tera blast does a lot of damage, and their new move bitter malice drops attack as well as does damage even through shields.
More like Walking Nightmare. Also, these new raids didn't even last for 2 days, since release, Iron Hands was by far the best option for any raid and that's it.
One hit Iron Leaves with +6 Kingambit fyi
so they're one per savefile, do they have perfect IVs?
Walking Walk was easy.
My Walking Wake was Adamant when I caught it
50% of 80 is 40, my dude, not 60 XD they're base power 120 when boosted XD
Guys, if you got time… just fly to Casseroya Lake. Omg they really did fix the performance. Even boxes operate faster in that area too oddly 😏
I think we're gonna get an ancient form of the justice trio akin to the sketches and a new future paradox of the legendary doggies. Just my two cents
anyone tried volkarona holding a shell bell using calm mind to setup and bug buzz to attack?
It’s interesting that Iron Leaves gets Quash as the move is usually reserved for pokemon that are “royalty” aka have king or queen in their name.     *isnt there a king of paldea?*
The nature isn't fixed. My walking wake was timid. I can't speak for walking wake, but Ceruledge very easily handles iron leaves with swords dance, bitter blade, and clear smog.
Shiny lock?
Hydro steam in sun 80 x 1.5 (sun) x 1.5 (stab) x 1.3 (protosynthesis) = 232  (If Tera water then 312)  Unless bad math
Lets do math. The attack does 80 base power  + 80 for stab= 160 now add the 50% for the move   that = 320 times that by 2 if its teralized that is a whooping 640 if I did the calculations right that is not counting evs holy smokes
Kingambit destroys Iron Leaf
Soloed Iron Leaves with my Ceruledge holding Expert Belt running Bitter Blade, Shadow Claw, and Swords Dance.
Only 2 weeks oh I gotta get on this now
how do u allways manage to make every raid look complicated when there so easy xD
I used Meowscarada against Walking Wake and Skeledirge against Iron Leaves. Both holding shell bell
I'll say annihalape destroyed Iron leaves first attempt with no issues
You don't even get new Pokedex entries for them? Or did you just catch them already and didn't show them?
I joined someone's tera raid that has scarlet (I have violet) and my walking wake has a bashful nature with a 212 Sp. Atk. so maybe its different if you join someone elses raid?
Had 4 miradons take out walking wake haven’t beaten the second one
For Walking Wake, I used grimmsnarl online with spiritbreak and light screen. Makes Walking Wake hit like a wet noodle, its great. As for Iron Leaves I soloed with Chi Yu. These are pretty fun pokemon so pretty excited to see what the dlc is gonna be like
To defeat Iron Leaves I used my EV-trained Skeledirge with a Ghost-tera type by spamming Shadow Ball.
I've updated the game. Beaten the elite 4 and champ. I go online and update pok news and I can't see him anywhere. Do you need to complete area 0 first? Anyone able to help?
1st time i caught both exclusives within 10 mins of each other
Austin John: "80 + 40 = ...140!"  BOI
I soloed the Walkin Wake with Meowscarada with the clear amulet, beated it on my first try! For Iron Leaves, Kingambit and Iron Jugulis work quite well (just bring a shell bell to keep blastin like crazy)
Actually you could always switch the held items with the X button. I do it all the time! ❤❤❤❤
So you only get one or the other per save? It's not like the other version specific raids where you can do other raids via online for the others? Or is it you get one from each version using online?
I used the Slowbro prepped for the Greninja raid, and linked with my brother who used Luxray for Walking Wake. It took 3-4 tried to catch Iron Leaves. I had my Garchomp & my brother had a scizor prepped for that one
are you sure that the dlc will let us get more of these walking wake and iron leaves
PS. for those struggling with Virizion Armarouge is the perfect counter. set up psy terrain willo-wisp reflect and shadow ball and use psy terrain asap then willo wisp then reflect then chip health away.
these paradoxes mons will be back in tera raids, it was mentioned in small text in the presentation
No pokemon mystery dungeon news, Scarlet gets another banger paradox (violets is literally JUST VIRIZION...........), and no gen1-x on switch....  Not my favorite pokemon showcase but...yay dlc ig
I used the fire starter to just demolish the iron leaves.
im not sure the natures are fixed cause i caught adamandt Iron Leaf and saddy Walking Wake 🤔
got hasty on both while 1 had 5iv and other had 4iv
Walking Wake is NOT exactly the same for everyone in the world. It was the same on both games for you because you caught the exact same one from that specific den. Do be wary on that claim as many might like to reset for 0IV Atk.
It walks on water... so dope lmao
For iron Leaves Foul Play would really do some damage
Once again, thank you SO MUCH John for your timely and informative videos. You are one of the few people I get my Nintendo news from! LOVE YOUR WORK! KEEP IT UP! :D
A note on the stats of the caught raid pokemon, they're only the same for all the users who participated in the same raid, but 2 different raids will produce 2 pokemon with different natures and IVs. Wake and Leaves have 4 perfect IVs as 5 star raids grant, but which ones as well as their natures will vary per player, unless multiple players do a raid together. All players who catch the pokemon from the same raid will receive identical copies.
Austin John, they are not fixed stats and nature, I just caught one while watching this video, mine's Brave with different stats
How will you be able to get the other versions one
Guys also us for iron leaves sizor
Hi
Waking Lakes is a reptilian version of Suicune so Suicune is a lizard till this day?
Lol pokemon day also happens to break up into poke monday
Anyone know if they’re hostable online? Like can I (with violet) join a raid for walking wake from my friend (in scarlet) and catch it?
If I update will I lose my Charizard raid?
I have been using Scizor with a shell bell with great success against Iron leaves
Can someone get on datamining the update If the past is anything like today they may have left data on returning pokemon in today's S/V Update.  I need my Unova homies back!
Skeledirge and the azurmarill from the charizard raid clear these two very easily. Also saw a lot of people using Ceruledge
Bellibolt seems like a good option for the Walking Wake or whatever it is
Walking wake... am actual legendary beast... love it, can't comprehend the design
Props for videoing editing and posting two videos in one day
I was so confused when they announced dlc part one fall 2023 and part Two winter 2023..  I'm thinking isn't it currently winter 2023? lol do they mean a Christmas release 🤷🏾‍♂️
Just just got Walking Wake
Saw someone on reddit say you can solo Walking Wake with a choice band Meowscarada and Flower trick. Just tested it and it worked first try, it died once towards the end but still managed to beat it. My Meowscarada isn't properly EV trained  (most EVs are in attack tho) and didn't have the optimal nature (hasty instead of adamant) so I think it should be a pretty good counter, especially if you have a better one than mine.
Got a different nature
My question is can you see the violet exclusive in scarlet when your looking for another Tera raids
So can you get both? Like I have violet so I know I can get iron leaves by myself, but after could I join an online walking wake raid and get walking wake too?
Hey Austin, will you ever be doing Hogwarts Legacy videos? I'd love to see it on your channel
Didn't you only get the same stats on each profile because everyone who catches a Pokemon from a specific raid instance catches the exact same pokemon, like it works on every other raid?
The nature is not fixed
Has anyone heard anything about encountering an egg if encountering the raid? I challenged the raid and now its a black highlighted egg. help would be appreciated.
I would like to address real quick, for Iron Leaves, he hits hard, regardless if you are level 100 or not, he hits hard, so be sure your pokemon have high/max defense and special defense, or an item that boost those, while having high attack/special attack. I only say this because Iron Leaves I had a hard time getting, even with my level 100 pokemon, and my lvl 100 pokemon all have amazing and high stats. Basically Iron Leaves is easy to get the health down, but it will basically hit you and your teammates hard, sometimes even one shot you, to try and run down the clock, to where it can blow you out the cave. Oh and then, obviously, use moves that are super effective based on its type.  I used Ceruledge and hyper trained it's defense and special defense and gave it the armored vest.
Actually their natures are random, because I got different natures than yours
I caught Iron Leaves with a Friend Ball, Iron Leaves matches the Friend Ball so much..
Tyranitar with iron defense, taunt and crunch does amazing vs iron leaves long as you have stats maxed out. cant be hit with psyblade either.
I'm so sick of these bots that compliment the youtubers in the comments...
Iron hands, life orb, belly drum, charge, wild charge one shot lol
Does anyone know if you can size hunt these?
As a person who hates raid dens and hasn’t played scarlet and violet since 2 weeks after release and who’s Pokémon at mid lv 70’s I had so much trouble doing it solo thank god I barely play my switch every time I come back for whatever game nitendo always offers me a free 1 week online trial which I turn off auto renew. These  2 raid Pokémon were 1 shotting my Pokémon thankfully I got lucky finding people who actually do raids who were able to almost 2 shot these raid Pokémon. My living dex is now complete.
I got both iron leafs and walking wake from online raids 👍😁
kinda sucks they're currently tera raid exclusives cause the 7 star raids suck for casual players
Already got both of these! Thankfully they are only 5 star so it's super easy. The raids now seem a lot more stable now as well!
I beat Walking Wake 1st try, but can't seem to beat Iron Leaves...
Kind of dumb there’s a catch limit on these.
Can I join others online in the opposite game to catch the one not in my game?
Nature is not fixed between raids, my Walking Wake's Sassy while my Iron Leaves are Rash/Relaxed, haven't yet grabbed a second Walking Wake yet.  EDIT:  Also if you haven't seen it yet Walking Wake literally walks on top of water in a nod to Suicune's lore.
Nature isn't fixed I've got a modest nature walking wake
I defeated Walking Wake with a Meowscarada (Lvl. 100) using Flower Trick 7-8 times
I don’t have a lot of friends who play Pokémon so I love when you post about it. Makes me feel like I’m playing with a friend ✨🖤🥲
I should have gotten Scarlett... :(
These look fun!  Hoping for more convergent pokemon in the future DLC along with regional forms, too!
I beat wave first try with the same arboliva I used for pikachu
Do we know if these are shiny locked or not?
Hello! I didn’t see this mentioned in the comments but my Walking Wake was Jolly Nature, so I think the Nature and stats may be determined per raid. So everyone in a raid gets the same one, but redoing the raid would net a different Nature and Stat spread.
I was able to do it with my level 91 meowcarada
I think it is really stupid that you can only get these pokemon in tera raids. Not everyone does tera raids. I certainly don't.
Austin, the nature isn't fixed. I got Serious nature for mine, NOT relaxed.
Walking Wake can be very easily soloed if you have Miraidon. Simply click Electro Drift a couple of times and it should be good to go
Bug Tera volcorona did work for the leaf machine
I guess I dont need to watch this video! I dont want EITHER OF THEM!!!! They are both absolutely horrible
Finally, a raid event that Iron Hands can actually handle.  EDIT: Also in case anyone is curious, a good choice for the Iron Leaves raid is Kingambit. Since the only move that Iron Leaves has that can even hurt Kingambit is "Mega Horn", and even then it's only does neutral damage. Also, Kingambit can use the move taunt. Which is important in stopping Iron Leaves from setting up with Swords Dance. Here's the build I used, you can change it around If you want:  Important IV's: Atk, HP, and Def  EV's: 252 in Atk, 252 in HP, and 4 in Def  Moves: Swords Dance, Kotow Cleave (or Night slash), Iron Defence, and Taunt.  Ability: Either works  Item: Covert Cloak, but you can probably get away with running most items on Kingambit.  Strategy: Lead with taunt or Iron Defence (depends on if another player has a taunt user). This will weaken the damage that Megahorn does to you. After that you need to use one or two Swords Dances. Generally it didn't seem worth it to me go for three, but depending on your HP and the bosses HP. It may be worth going for.   After your done setting up, start spamming Kotow Cleave (or Night Slash) until it dies. (When Iron Leaves resets stat boosts, I recommend going for only one Swords Dance. As it's not worth it to go for more In my experience.)  Good luck!
I defeated like 3 iron leaves but only one walking wake, he is much more difficult, but if you have iron leaves then you are good to go
How does it work if you have the game physically but you have the dlc on the nintendo e shop. Can you still use the dlc?
Iron leaves I kinda annoying it covers it weaknesses so annoyingly
are the stats predetermined?
anybody have a lure ball for trade i want to catch suicune in it
Hey Austin John, you’re probably not gonna see this, but everyone is NOT getting the exact same Pokémon, the reason the two you caught of each are, is because they came from the same den, this applies to all Pokémon that are found in raids, all members catch an identical mon.
I found Annihilape with Leftovers made Iron Leaves super easy, 3 Bulk Ups and a Screech, then Rage Fist one-shots it
i used annihilape for iron leaves was easy
I just got my Walking Wake. I named him Mizu.
For Iron Leaves: I brought Annihilape with muscle band, used Bulk Up for 3 turns, then hit it with Rage Fist. It was over in one hit.
Scizor running max Defense & Attack OHKO's Iron Leaves if you run 3 Iron Defense, 3 Swords Dance, and X-Scissor. I found that out by searching for good Pokemon to use, finding that Scizor was recommended, and then just trying to work out a good raid set for it. I put Leftovers on mine, but I think Shell Bell would be better
Can you breed these ??
Natures are not fixed. My natures were Rash and hasty
already got them
So I don't think the Nature is fixed because the one I caught pairing up with a friend was Sassy Nature on Walking Wake and I got Naive Nature on Iron Leaves while my friend got Impish Nature. Also for Iron Leaves we kinda brute forced it by pairing my Friend's Skeledirge with my Grimmsnarl. Only thing I'd Change going forward with Grimmsnarl in this set up is using Break Spirit instead of Play Rough.
If hydro steam is the new scald I will be so happy
Love your videos super helpful
Kingambit does really well for both. Love to see it
Can we really only catch 1 species per save? I really hope we get to encounter these again or more frequently in the future 😕
My walking wake was a neutral nature, so it’s not set nature. And it’s a huge Pokémon. Walking wake is a bad ass.
Like I said previously, an alternate for Virizion is using Kingambit due to resist and having a straight inmunity. Meanwhile I just soloed Suicune with my Assault Vest Tsareena lmao
Arent the moves 180 with stab and weather/terrain effect?
Great Video, although the math is a bit off. The actual boosted base powers for these attacks are 120, not 140
Haven’t tried the Virizion paradox yet, but I’m tried Walking Wake with Azurmaril and done it first try. Just don’t tera into fairy. Trust me.   Huge power/Belly drum and Play Rough Azumarill with shell bell.
my walking wake wasn't relaxed
So I soloed Iron Leaves with Kingambit, I used 3 sword dances and 1 Kowtow cleave and it was down. And FYI Austin the natures aren't fixed because I have a Impish Walking Wake and a Hardy Iron Leaves
Great content been playing Pokémon since 1998 and you provide what a good player needs
Thanks for the video and happy Pokémon day
I didn’t even know DLC was already announced. The first one isn’t releasing until December though?? That’s not the correct date is it?? That seems way too far out.  And it’s $35 for each game?? The hell is that???
Austin John I hope you hit 100 million subs you’re my fav poketuber and the most dedicated and helpful plz can I have a shoutout in the next video I gratefully appreciate you
My walking wake is Brave nature
This was easy. I don’t even have online subscription I solo’d it with Gholdengo
Walking wake is the best of the two. It's just beautiful.
You can 2-3 shot Walking wake with miraidon - Charge and then electro Dift
Only 2 weeks? That's unfortunate
I was able to get walking wake my self
i got both immediately using an annihilape!
Can you get both of these Pokemon one from your game and the other from another game online?
so just to make sure you can catch one of each or only just one of them. Like only walking wake and then you can't get iron leaves or does John mean one of each Pokemon.
I used Miraidon for Walking Wake, and one shot it, for Iron leaves I used Kingambit and it was not that hard
I personally found these 5 Star Raids pretty easy with Bellibolt with Metronome for Walking Wake, and Gholdengo with 3 Nasty Plots + Shadow Ball for Iron Leaves.
can u get both pokemon on the same save?
Woo
Walking Wake: 515 BST, Iron Leaves 590 BST. The regular forms are 600 BST. I wonder why walking wake only has 515 BST.
You sir, are a saint ❤
Iron Leaves solo was easy. Used the gold dude and just used nasty plots and shot em down.   Used grimsnarl support for Walking Wake
im liking using kingambit against iron leaves
They are not the same the nature's and IVs vary from raid to raid
Hey, definitly not fixed I have a Bashful Walking Wake, along with stats being diff.
What do we do if we're trying for both? Do we just visit a friend's game go game on the raid?
7:05 My walking wake had a bashful nature...
stats are NOT fixed I have done different raids and reset after and gotten different stats, austin got the same stats cause he was in the same raid and the same raid gets the same stats lol
Has the best patch fixed anything performance related?
Austin i just want to say i am a big fan of your channel and videos, I have watched you for years. I was hyped for your video about pokemon presents, love your videos keep it up
For anyone who’s caught walking wake take it out of the ball….. ITS HUGE
Hey Austin my walking wake had Hardy nature so I'm pretty sure it can be any nature
I so regret getting Pokemon Violet. Pokemon Scarlet has the far better Paradox forms.
My stature different
Iron Leaves : *exists* Me with my shiny strat Tera(insect) Slither-Wing : "And now look at me and this opportunity, just standing right in front of me~"  (I love my big moth bby 💖)
Natures don’t appear to be fixed. My Walking Wake was careful
sucks that its one only. now i gotta wait till i can get nintendo online for my alt too get another iron leaves too trade
Anyone else wondering when they will make a paradox Pokemon for violet that doesn’t start with “iron” 😂
Took down Iron Leaves on my 1st try with Iron Hands
Baxcalibur with sword dances and crunch or bite does wonders to virzion
Heads up nature and IV are not same for everyone. Just who you tera raid with
As usual with the informative and efficiently timed content from Austin. Real question is where is your hoodie from? Because I need that in my life...
Suicine/walking wake can be solo'd by Iron hands  Iron leaves, I used a skeldirge online and it was fairly easy
Iron leaves is a menace he hits so hard
Hey ! You are so fast as always ! FYI stats and nature are not fixed ! ;)
can you join the raid of another player to get the other version exclusive?
Stats and nature aren't fixed! I got a Relaxed WW and Bold IL
That's a sick hoodie! Thanks for the info AJP!
Man I want to use my shiny charzard
Also the nature is not fixed my walking wake had a different nature
bruhhh walking wake is insane looking i regret buying violet🥹
7:00 that just means they are from the same raid, as mine is sassy walking wake and quirky iron leaves so no, everyone will NOT be getting exact same
Just solo’d both of them, pretty easy. I like the Water/Dragon typing!
I'm rocking Violet, and I was able to raid and catch them both. 🤷
For Walking Wake, I had Aboliva use Solar Beam when it used Sunny Day.  I was able to take enough Flamethrowers. Got it on my second attempt.
Can someone send you a walking wake Tera From Scarlet to Violet?
is Walking Wake and Iron Leaves shiny locked?
Had my Azuremarill take it down. Definitely not a easy 5 star lol.
welp, I guess im not getting the cool dinosaur/robot horse because my pokemon in both pokémon scarlet and violet are too weak to do a tera raid battle. I hope you can catch these two in the DLC without having to do a tera raid.
Is there a way to get both mons in one copy of the game without trading?
Iron leaves is brutal I’ve already done 15 fights with it and all of them failed because as soon as we get in five turns later we’re dead
Bro I’m still trying to get a iron hands from your stupid ass trade codes that don’t work for scarlet players!!!!!!!!!!
What kind in the Suicune name is this?
Ah yes lovely, another raid I can't beat Edit: but thank you so much for your hard work dude
Got em both, and it's lame we get all these things, but nothing to do with them
If Austin is anything he is EFFICIENT
Already got them easy fight
Both was super easy to catch for me
Do you have to have beaten the game to unlock these?
These 2 were hard but got em, why did their sp atk and atk heighten in battle and then the ones I catch had speed lowering and defence heightening nature's 🤣🤣
Austin can u pls tell me the best way to make a Pokémon good for raids(also how do I get 6 star raids)
I thourght they would be 7 star raids but no that's strange
Beat Iron Leaves with my *shiny* Kingambit and beat Walking Wake with Miraidon and got a shiny Teddiursa on the way to the Iron Leaves raid!
CRAZY how quick he got this up lol
Most likely, you will be able to get these paradoxes in one of the DLCs.   I'm hoping there will also be Paradox Raikou and Entei and Paradox Terrakion and Cobalion.   There's also a part of me hoping that each trio can fuse to become something like the sketches we saw in the base game!
so many people on discord saying this is so easy and dismissing anyone having trouble with it..
Crap I got the game a few days ago and am still playing through the story, hopefully I can get these in time :(.
I was waiting for the raid video after the direct one came out, thank you for all your tutorials Austin! They mean the world to us
AJP, you've made my Pokemon Day! Thank you for putting these raid guides together and being the real Poke OG
@austinjohnplays are you bummed about No GBA games??
thank you so much, could you also do how to get the zorark code as it wasn't really explained in the presents
I beat walking wave in one try. I’m currently on my seventh for iron leaves. Since I have scarlet it’s meant that for every raid I do, I have to get communication errors at least 3 times
Walking wake gave me trouble since I was in a raid with other people. I still managed to get both. Iron leaves is really easy just use a slither wing with lunge and Tera bug no need to boost stats just use lunge. I like both of these paradox legendaries but wish they had story relevance instead of being just delegated to raids.
Now I have to finish both games in two weeks in order to get these Pokémon 😢😢😢
Guess I’m not getting them
Another legendary variant lets gooo
Does anyone knows when can i transfer pokemon from pokemon home to scarlett
when's the next seven star raid and what is it
Omg they're so cool!
Since there only 5 stars you don’t need to make a new build and can use any old one which is nice
Let’s goo❤ thanks Austin you the goat man 🫡
how does he do this so quickly💀
I'm glad it's 5 *
I hope they add it so we can release Pokémon in groups
It was so stupid of them to make this a raid.  I’m not done with the game yet but now I have to finish it FAST
Bro iron leaves is kicking my shins with unparalleled aggression
A better name for iron leafs would have been Verizon wireless
Too late, they were fairly easily to beat!  Iron Hands manhandled Walking Wake, and Ceruledge with Phantom Force are Iron Leaves.
This notification was like a blessing to me as I was frantically searching about the new Pokémon
But both Walking Wake and Iron Leaves will return in the future. Wdym 2 weeks only?
Brother you are the best for this content and thank you for what you do. Can't wait for more news and to catch these bad boys today
Need Walking invites
How to get deez
Hi how are y’all
