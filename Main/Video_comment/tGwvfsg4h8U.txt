The Saab was the best one! Plus the fact that Simon had a blackout while driving his beloved Saab, it got sold on and he's since managed to claim it back again and repair it and do more mods to it. Needs more appreciation
Hey. Do you guys still do this kind of thing. I’m a regular watcher and know some beautiful people that could do with the help on a Land Rover defender.
Hilarious boys , Rory is a legend.
Rory's anthracite grey voice sounded like a perfect impression of Michael Gove
I would never buy one, but I like the Nissan Juke. I like the look of the thing, I like how it has a big but small vibe to it. I even like the lights on the front. It's the sort of car I'd persuade my wife to buy so I could have a go in it now and then.
"This is boring, it's awful, it reminds me of a Kia"  Me sitting her with a Kia.. -_-
anyone have the mr2s socials??
The BBC guy is in the way.
I want to buy Volkswagen
Nice seeing you guys together this way.
Nice one guys
Hope all four of them should be together forever 💪💪💪💪
I  love this channel
😂
Saab and Alfa were decent 👌🏽
Volvos 2 for 2 thumbs up LETS GOOO!!!
Real good
Hey
I love you Alex!
I love that 850 in fact I will replicate it on fh5
I love the MR2 though
those volvos were filthy
Good
Really cool
🔥
Good
Lovely
I don't have a car for you to roast sadly 🤣🤣
Okayy
Hmmmm.
💙
You guys should be roasted for the awful sound quality of this video. It sounds shittier than a shitcan exhaust on a clapped out Civic. You know better!
cool
The bean reference was so bad 😂🤣😂🤣
Rory is used to finance shitboxes that no one can afford, completely out of touch.
How can a red Alfa Romeo ever be shit? And it's a hot hatch, Giulietta QV is a 1.75L 240hp that not just makes reliable power, but also drives good in "N", is sporty in "D" eating up the corners, has Alfa's DNA system, etc. It's like saying Rory is s#it because I don't like his haircut. Besides the fugly headliner, had everything carbon, nice rims, perfect condition, etc. And since when is a hot hatch a shit box? Is he making too much money reviewing cars that a hot hatch (any model) is a shit box? F..ken Alfa haters. They know nothing about Alfas. I'm 90% sure that he did not understood at that time the QV part or did not knew what a QV is.
I’m starting to see why I don’t like journalists commenting on cars and you guys have a lot in common I do thoroughly enjoy your show Alex but as a mechanic of 25 years I disagree with a lot of opinions
The 944 is an Audi anyway
See Rory and can't watch, the bloke is worthless!!
Class Video! More with Rory haha
What was wrong with the Alfa Romeo? Was honestly surprised by that.
The Volvo was lovely they didn’t praise enough!
I love you guys!  All best. 🤩
So, I've just got my first car (2010 Corsa se). I've always wanted to do up my own car but I'm not sure what mods to put in first. I want to make it lighter, faster but also keep somewhat comfy because it's a daily. Any help from you or the community would be appreciated. Anything I can do for looks on this car?
Rory is absolutely hilarious 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ngl I skipped through this vid
Actually, cranberry jam on steak is f*cking rad
Reggie is just too annoying, sorry :( bb
Should spend more time showing the cars, as you've done in previous episodes. We kinda get you have Rory on, but showing the car for 2seconds and then roasting it for a minute kinda forget what it even looked liked.. :/  Its called Roast subscribers cars, not watch 4 men on the casting couch.. 🤷🏻‍♂️
He loves the 'simple' Volvo, but shits on the Civic for doing the exact same thing... Right.
Would have been interesting video but then there is Rory who has absolutely no zero understating about cars, we've seen that on that horrible season of so called "Top Gear".
Very little time showing the cars.  I know we are here for the reactions but at least show the photo of the car in the corner or something.
Rory in Metcons whaaaaaat
£1000 car vs G-Wagon pt.2?!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nUvSuvI2Bk&ab_channel=CarThrottle do u remember this ?? !!
The Alfa was sick - what you guys smoking to call it a s**t box??
The first car there's one of them around were I live its sick
I'm here
Them making fun of an anthracite grey Saab hit just a little to close, just don't like at my old videos haha
Turned into Roasting Ethan there for a minute lol
That MR-2 though
i can almost garentee this wont be seen but if youguys at car throttle do a q and a can you awnser what age you become a car inthusiast thanks
Your guest is a bit of an arrogant @@@@@, by the way!
Show the photos for longer, please.
Not the same without Alex.  😔
Rory is not a car guy. Never will be. He just likes anything new and standard.
Agree with the starlights making it look a lil bit too much, but the Giulietta QV is bloody beautiful. How is it a shitbox??!! Would rather take this rather than any hot hatches of its time.
That grey makes it look like an Airfix kit that they built and then never bothered to paint it.
Love how many Volvos was there❤️
I have a question I am about to buy a rx8 but what kind of oil brand and type do you recommend ?
Rory brave while wearing them on his feet
I dunno who got roasted more by Rory, the cars or Alex LOL
Rory's a tadger.
why is Alex on this channel?
So what does Rory drive???
Does this setup mean we’re gonna get the podcast back?
In next weeks episode we roast Rory’s trainers!
Podcast !!
Where can I send you my ride?
He is calling a Giulietta QV a shitbox.... 🤡
That volvo with ferarri wheel caps is the most ricer thing I've seen in a decade.
Dat Mercedes 190 t-shirt. Just epic.
Jalapeno jelly on steak and eggs with toast. Heavenly breakfast.
how come rory is acting mature and decent when he has gone over the top everytime he modified a car on top gear. he is flashy "ahem trainers" and extravagant. is he getting old? or that nissan leaf has made him boring
DOO MOREEE BUDGET ROAD TRIP CHALLENGES !!
That first livery was a good job for me. The owner gave some thought and put some effort into the livery so that it fit well with the shape
That Volvo 850R tho 👌
Hating on the giulietta got me mad.
I thought the white MR2 was the best of the bunch 👌🏻
Rory was the last decent presenter on Top Gear
Guys you really need to find better cars than just some standard cars with lowering springs and tints, borrinnggggg
Need less time looking at the presenters and more time at the cars if they're still talking about them. Could maybe put a small image of the car in the corner.
I love that you don't hold back calling people bellends lolol.
The orange Volvo was the best.
Shitting on the AR Giulietta just because of the Starlights is like shitting on CarThrottle as a whole because of something stupid and small 👀... Make it make sense
Come now gents, you’re too good at this to have this poor of sound; explain yourselves.
Too many ads
nice audio lads
Rory talking about small man syndrome without a hint of irony though....
What was wrong with the Alfa?
What has Rory got on his feet
That alfa and juke nismo are awesome
why would you send a picture of a juke to these guys
It’s not a Nissan Juke, it’s a Nissan Puke😂😂😂
What a lemon
Is it boring if I just "mod" my car to make it more quiet and comfortable?  Sound insulating foam & pads, better shocks etc.   Don't get me wrong fast cars are fun and all but if I only have one car I'd rather be relaxed and comfortable driving it.
Never understood your hatred towards the giulietta qv, its a beautiful car inside (albeit without that headliner) and out, and spanks almost all other fwd hatches of the time
You should make more of these!
That Aygo was super sick, a lot of european hillclimp cars look like that. Even such amateur racing is super expensive here so people use cheap little and light cars like that to race.  These widebody kits often look a little bit rudimentary like the 80s and 90s boxy touring cars because people build them at home because its an easy way to get a much wider track while conforming to the regulations.
I fucking love Rory Reid 😂
I've never really been a massive fan of Alfa's but that one was clean, not sure why it got roasted so much. Okay the roof lining was a bit unnecessary but apart from that it was mint.
Ngl, that gulietta looks good imo.
how is a mega clean Giulietta QV a shit box, separate from the interior lights as well? What's the line for shit box then?
Love that MR2. That Volvo aswell(both of them), adore it.
The shitbox Lupo is the buttcrackmobile
Alex, where did you get that t shirt? I want one!
sub should rost yours cars
That corrado is sick
Getting some big "we don't have enough chairs" vibes over here.
Love seeing CT work with Rory! My absolute top content creators
Rory Reid, a name any Husky could effortlessly pronounce.
we would love to see the cars instead of you four talking:)
Rory is really not funny it’s embarrassing 😴
Aha was great to see the V70 made it back onto the channel!
is it when you don't work for car throttle you get to wear shoes in a room?
Is that a mb w201 or a w124 on the shirt?
Rory doesn’t pull any punches does he 🤣
850R on the 10k’s worth of wheels scrapes through as ok 😂
Alex... you have my car on your T-Shirt. Top man!
Rory is looking sharp. Where do we get that hoodie?
Brill
These need to be so much longer
why even record this video if you're just going to shit on any original cars? haha
Audio was less than awesome. Real hard to hear what's being said
The Volvo 850r that you guys showed here in Sweden if you have that exactly car you are going to be bullied
Awesome video you guys!! Especially the Super Swedes 👌 👍 Volvo and my beloved Saab 😎
I love Alex's t shirt that's awesome
The aygo looks like shopping cart lolz
Did the autotrader man just insinuate the most raced car in the world is not a sports car?
He isnt wrong on that BMW, its ugly
v6 is worthless
I loved the Corrado v6. Legit future classic. My neighbour had one and I've always liked it. Don't like scissor doors on a normal car, but if you're gonna do a racing livery, why the fuck not?  Also that Saab is goreous.
Speaking of Juke's.. I've never been more pissed off when driving on track than when a guy started pulling away from me in my Civic EG9 (B16a2 sedan) with his Juke 1.6t because it started raining and he had awd... 😅 God they're hideous!
Harsh but hilarious! I would just add, please don’t put Ferrari badges on any car, unless it’s a Ferrari!
Get matt Watson on
Bad editing.
The audio suck. Didn’t the mics work?
Is it me, or Rorry is the the guy that keeps failing at auto journalism?
***Subscribers'
Does Rory like any cars?
Sound for the picture in Peterborough top man 👌
Tell me you don't know shit about cars without telling me you don't know shit about cars: *say a Giullieta is a shitbox* ... And he probably raves on about Golfs too... Fuckin' hell 😂
You can’t say shit about other peoples’ styles while wearing those ugly ass Nikes
Finally, car people have come around to loving Volvo station wagons. Was about fucking time.
Alex the widebody aygo
Who forgot to press record?
Well that was shit wasn't it ..
Could we see the pictures for longer time? Maybe leave it somewhere in the bottom of the frame
Good to see Volvo’s are proving to be cool. Glad I still have my 850R shit box!
This one was absolutely hilarious please have Rory in the next one!
Corrado was not bad at all. Scissor doors are strange but they’re strange at the best of times tbf
Maybe more time showing the cars and less of the guys please
Dafuq? That Guilietta was pretty nice outside, whats with all the hate? Starlight headliner is a no go of course, but come on, it aint that bad of a car. Also in general, the roasts were pretty lame this time. "its just shit" is a shit roast.
Please Do more with Rory and more of these. This was fantastic.
The only shitbox here is Rory.
Ah man that MR2 is a piece of art
I actually liked the alfa
Want the the 2 volvos
You guys sound like you're talking from the toilet
He is dead right about the bmw looking like a Kia  I was looking at a Kia and did actually think it was a bmw 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Token black dude again 😣
That 850R! Congratulations to you if it's yours and you're reading this. Also, please get in touch if you ever want to sell it😀
This  is cool....
Alex is spot on about that 2series lookin like a Kia. Couldn't agree more. 😴
1:43 kinda arrogant and dumb from someone who promotes electric converted "classic cars" on autotrader, even worse classic sport cars, keep those cheap chinese EV pieces of crap out of the classics 3:10 You couldn't be more right Alex. 6:07 And yet you say that electric "classic cars" are a good thing...
Datsun Duck was a great place to finish. Love your work 👍
Omg I've got a car you need to roast in from the convict colony Australia
That was my 228xi gran coupe and I have traded it in for a 2022 230i. So it is definitely gone. Thank you for featuring my car.
Keep the cars in the corner of the screen whilst they roast it.
Best: MR2 with the V6 Worst: Crackmobile Tied for Killer Ride: Both Volvos! Both the 240 and 850 wagons look great with mods.
Alex? He quit...
it's not the bat Mobile its the crap mobile 🤣
Lmao this is more like character assassination rather than roast the ride 😂😂😂😂😂
That red Volvo wagon really does it for me and I have no idea why!!!!!
I always thought the 944 was a tacky shouty 924. The 924 is most definitely the prettier car.
Rory needs to try bacon jam on his steak.
Please leave the car pictures more on the video, like if you also agree!
5:22 no wonder he looks so damn serious 100% of the time
Love that shirt Alex! Where do I get one?
Dude literally quick top gear the best car show ever 😂. Has no room to talk really
Whoever did the edit at #5:47 is a genius! Brilliant!
Rory Reid? Please nooooo
The Alfa was mad, what's wrong with you people?
Rory Reid = meh... they took him off top gear for a reason
6:05 You can have jam on steak, but you are supposed to have it marinate on it for a while before you grill it. I’ve never done it before, but we’ve used honey. People will even marinate it in Dr Pepper, which I can only assume they sell where you are. If not, Mr Pibb?   -BBQ enthusiast from Texas
Rory Reid is about as entertaining as cancer
I like the video but it is a bit cut short. I would have loved a bit more shit talking about the cars. You guys have been a bit too aggressive  on the edit
3:00 Luton, seen this mess driving around like a chav ! Its noisy and slow.
I couldnt send pics of my new runabout think words may elude theses guys i call it mutley its lets just say a strange old puma.... but a good laugh to drive!
Poor Rory.... I see them grey hairs, haha
Rory makes a great 4th with the CT guys.   However…  Rory judging peoples taste/style choice while wearing those trainers 🤷🏼‍♂️
"Here's here so he's done something right" hahaha
Now I want to buy a portacabin and put star lights and a 4D number plate on it 😂
Not remotely exotic? It’s a VR6 Corrado. It doesn’t get much more rare. However the doors on the rare VW are a crime. I’m calling the police.
Lupo is solid. Not that one though.
Rory will never own anything as cool as that T5. #RorysClueless
I’m a slut for a Volvo estate. Of all generations.
Dat BMW wagon though. 🥺
Seriously hilarious. Cheers!
Please help me find the socials for that MR2, I need to know more Had an MR2 years ago and always regretted letting it go, been thinking of a project recently and this just ticks all the boxes
Bacon Jam is actually a thing 👍
Ethan's face when he looks up whilst Alex is talking about the bmw touring.... priceless 🤣🤣
I've sent some photos to your Instagram 😊
Leds in footwell IS NOT A MOD
Oh I really like the first car
6:44 What is that offset!? Bro needs to have 0 offset rather than +30 and remove the spacers!
Never realised how funny Rory is 😂
I'm tempted to submit my car lol but it's completely stock
what's the obsession (and a dumb one) of putting prancing horses on cars that aren't
That metro is absolutely rapid btw. 275hp in a car that weighs 750kg. 1.8 turbo rover k series engine
Rory fit right in with the lads. The vibes in this video are immaculate
Rory is a miserable sod isnt he. No appreciation for the individual at all
Rory and Car Throttle! win!
i hope we can all club together and get Jack some proper trousers that fit him.
the volvo appreciation made me smile
Getting called a bell end by rory reid is a highlight of my life ❤️😅
Don't mean to be negative, but not a fan of Rory in this set up. He's good on autotrader, but idk the existing trio is something else.
Watching this makes me realise how much I disagree with Rory! He actually made me feel sorry for Alex and that is unforgivable.
He’s a boring whopper is. Reid
1:35 i throw up
Leave auto trader to auto trader. You 3 are better without.
Good on Alex for doing his own thing. I really hope the Car Throttle thing continues, the dynamic between Ethan, Jack and Alex is what makes the show for me.
It's odd that YouTube will let you say shit, but you have to bleep out the word wank.
Brilliant laught out loud points....rory, funny as
That aygo is rapid Rory.... Little weapon
Wait he left car throttle...?
9:36 this is just damn rude.. calling a alfa Romeo gullietta qv a shitbox , nothing special. Stupid no one Rory who??..
Remember watching that metro on officially gassed. Shame it's a bit more 'send it' now but hey ho. Still sick
Lol @ that dude in the heels; He says the mr2 isn’t a sports car, but it’s a rwd mid engine car. He dislikes the cool little wide body hatch, and he called an Intercooler a number plate, plus that “send it” decal is from Hoonigan which most car guys would know. It’s a roast though so fair play, I guess.
Rory's cool. He should get a job with Top Gear or Autotrader.
Rory's anthracite grey rant was a perfect analysis of that SAAB
The Alfa gullietta looked cool on the outside.. I don’t know what’s wrong with it on outside..
5:45 I think the e46 bmw is pill off crap ( I had an 328i and every 2 weeks something went wrong with it . Luckily I sold it.
*''i put fuel in it''*
Blueberry jam on steak is amazing, don’t knock it until you try it, honestly
"When i see send it on the number plate i think bellend" one someone calls a intercooler a number plate i think bellend hahahahaha
If you haven’t already, go and subscribe to Alex’s new solo channel.  I will still enjoy Car Throttle but Autoalex is posting the content we have always wanted…PHIL!
Send it on the ‘number plate’ 🤔 hmmm 😂
I love the 850R
Yey should do living with a vintage tractor
Had enough of Roasty Reid. Please don't bring him back.
You still havent done mai kar 👍👍👍... awesome ......😭 been sending emails since the first RMR episode ...... hundred thousand years ago ..... STILL..
The almost non-reaction to this famous white MR2 hurt me in my soul.
@ the Volvo owner
Seen videos on that MR2 @2:32 before.. omg that thing is a beast! sounds insane! Spoke to the guy through dms and he's a super sound bloke!"
Still a massive fan of car throttle and so happy for Alex and his channel (auto Alex cars) keep it up team and thank you 😊
Sorry guys cack  Yr normal so much better 😌
Rory is just rude, he is just unfunny. 😂
meanwhile in austria, putting jam on shnitzel
When i was reading the title i tought its a video from donut media lol
Rory is savage! 😂
nice roast but the audio kinda sucked, almost sounds like you used the cameras audio
That slow zoom into Ethan! 🤣🤣🤣
Good video. Absolute shit audio. Someone needs a slap for that.
Of course he likes scissor doors! He's from Essex right?
👉I HAVE CARS YOU GUYS CAN ROAST😎‼️
The Dutch Volvo 🤘🏻
1:00 - calls corrado vr6 not exotic. Hurts my feelings, bought 2.9 corrado a week ago 🥺
how do we send photos of our cars in?
anyone knows what sneakers Rory is wearing?
"I put fuel in it." lel 🤣
Great collab! Cheers!
I think the Alfa Romeo is beautiful - besides the starlight roof of course
8:30 #teamEthan ... that Porsche is a sort of sight. Not a 911, a 924. It won't be mainstream, THAT is why it is elegant. Also .. I would want that as first car. Get that Juke a deflatine!
When will there be a new car throttle podcast episode?
I got an idea for a cheap car challenge, instead of picking a type of car you guys can pick a manufacturer. Its a bit like top gears £1500 Porsche challenge but you're all going to be together obviously
Sorry, but I must be the only person that does not find Rory at all funny....adds nothing to this otherwise funny episode....
Jam on steak sounds amazing I’m gonna try that tomorrow what jam should i try it with though ?
Yaaas, I'm so nearly a bellend 😅🙏
If you intentionally buy a juke I disagree with you. I don’t disagree with your decision, I disagree with YOU Looks massive, has the leg room of a Ryanair flight.
Oh good lord... Rory smashes it. What a legend.  Another great shows peeps. 👌
Would love to know why Jack and Ethan had their shoe wearing privileges revoked 😂
Nice, but please show a little more car, and a little less you :)
Is that Alex from Autoalex Cars?!
holy shit these roasts were so mediocore I got food poisoning
2:42 that's the perfect car
Can you ask Rory how Mark Dennis is? For me please?
Roast My Reid
I thought Alex had left car throttle ?
The most awesome car in the whole video is on Alex' T-shirt haha
My car is such a shit box if I sent it in they'd feel sorry for me 🤣
Wtf? Why is the Giulietta hated so much?
oh gawd another guy...
Rory on top form today 😜
Should send in my MG Metro or Golf Mk2 collection or my Scooby XT
Something I can't stand about when people modify their cars is when they put badges from different car manufacturers on. I saw it more than I would've liked to here and it just doesn't look right. That Volvo was almost perfect until I saw the Fezza horse on the wheels, and then that Saab 9-3 had a badge near the indicator light. Damn it, man.
Love content like this 😂🔥
5:50 Him realising he's in for the same story about a f*cking BMW again, made me laugh so hard i farted
6:45 anyone else pause to stare at that sexy 850R
Can't take this seriously when he's wearing high heeled trainers 😂😂
Oooooo getting closer to top gear Alex
I'd rather have lupus than own a lupo 😎
Jam on steak is fricking delicious! Dont knock it till you've tried it
How has no one mentioned those heel shoes !?
A while ago I submitted my Mitsubishi Colt for a good roast. It is very well possible they didn't do it because they didn't want to get a tetanus shot for a stupid video 🤣
Rory comes across as abit of a fool. Swears to make up for lack of car knowledge. Small wide cars are sh1t? Countless rally cars prove that point to be  stupid. Dont bring him back chaps
Following that aygo on tiktok I think it’s cool as fuck 😂
the metrog ..... dragged kicking and screaming into the light before being blasted down an isle at halfords
Oh jokes on you Jack i have never put gasoline in my car
Just want to ask where was my Polo i sent in 😂
I love when the camera tightens up on Ethan and the audio fades when discussing the e46 😂😂
You should check out the hideousness in the car park of Network rail in Milton Keynes on a Saturday night.
Why bother to mic everyone up to then use what sounds like the camera mic's inaudible echoey mess. :(
Stick to your regular 3 guy format !
That 245 man. That 245.
Lol that Volvo with the Ferrar wheels is from my town
the MR2 is slick! kudos to the owner!
Rory is hilarious, used to love him on top gear, great guy
6:44 Now imagine that, but with a Wartburg 353 estate. Same gold BBS wheels, dropped/bagged with a GDR green paintjob, probably original from the 60-70's, towing a camper. I can confidently say the wheels cost several times as much as that communist car was worth new but damn the execution was perfect.
Can’t wait to see how much of Alex we see on CT when his channel takes off! 🤪
Does this mean that podcasts will be back since there in the room where they filmed the last several podcasts before they took a long break from podcasts??
Hello and welcome, my name is freelance Alex
Alex I like your t shirt
YESS!! our nismo made it on the show!!! Get in!!!
Liking a Volvo with Ferrari rims and calling an Alfa Romeo a shitbox..
Trying to make a lupo look mean is like trying to convince people that your kitten is actually a tiger
Glad this has come back, was thinking about these last night, now we just need the podcasts back
I like Rory's hoodie. Does it go in with colours or whites when washing though...?
I would watch these types of videos for hours
I want you guys to roast my car but how do i contact you guys
Rory talks about cars like he's in his 60s can't be different than factory if so ur a bell end 🤣
Beanz meanz fartz!!
Where was the roast? Seems like you guys put no effort into this. This whole video felt like you guys tried to improvise with some quick witted insults, but all you can say is literally shit.. thats pretty terrible..
No better start of the weekend than when CT release a video👍✌😁
After the scizzor door comment i should put them on my R53 MINI XD
Alex living rent free
Idk but I thought that Alfa was dope. It was the second cleanest after that red wagon.
I saw that 850r at fitted uk 2 years ago was awesome
Some great looking Volvo's in there , and the nismo juke is great.
I love these videos please do more
The fact the Rover 100 had 'CRY' on the number plate, tells you all you need to know 😂  The Volvo 850R is the car for me. Trying so hard to be a bellend, just like myself. A match made in heaven 😂
Wonder if alex will show in future ones as a guest or never show again. Pre recorded before he left, sad times but his own channel cutting Phil up is awesome 🤣
I already loved the roast videos, but Rory made it even better! I'd happily watch hours of these
Cant watch this stuff with rory in it. Hes okay but hes rude full stop and disrespectful. Reason why hes not.....
Could we pause on the cars for a bit longer
The first car was a great car
It always throws me off that Rory is 42. He's so down with the kids.
Rory is to funny! Keep him coming back
I DONT EVEN LIKE GUILIETTAS CUZ OF THOSE FRONT HEADLIGHTS BUT THAT ONE LOOKS SICK FROM THE OUTSIDE YOU PEOPLE ARE DAFT
"Casting couch"
WHAT DO YOU MEAN that 4d number plate looks GOOD
wait what?
“He’s not gone too far”, they say… whilst focusing on the Ferrari wheels attached to a Volvo…
Rory does not get to give an opinion with those shoes on his feet
what happened to the podcast? :(
I think Rory added zip to this.
i was your 530th like :)
I remember seeing a vw corado with a ferrari f40 body kit on it looked amazing
We want more
Please Bring back the Monday Podcast.  I used to listen to it on the way to work. It made my Mondays just a bit more bearable.
Rory got high heel trainers?! 😳
Well all I can say is I quite like Anthracite Grey.
I personally love volvos, I have 2, but you can tell by this video that volvo has money invested in car throttle lol
i saw that volvo 850r at the late brake show live in manchester and it was bloody gorgeous
Car Trottle = Best YouTube car channel
Loved the video.
🥱
Thought alex left
Nissan Dukes are awful. I’m amazed people like them.
Rory, Matt, Chris H. and Sabine were the best Top Gear presenters after the original trio. BBC really screwed up letting Rory and Matt go.
I really liked that VR6, is there something wrong with my taste?
Rory even copied Clarksons "voice" for a car nerd..
Thatsilveraygo that aygo is crazy! Cool little car
Are you guys keeping this shooting location? Can I ask, where is this, did you say a farm building?
Love seeing CT work with Rory! My absolute top content creators
3:41 😂😂😂😂
That volvo is clean asf for what I can see from the pictures. Props to you
Been waiting a long time for this! 2:55 😎I am a small man btw
yes Jack! love the scissor doors too!
People really be sending in their grocery getters
Hope Alex's relationship with Car Throttle continues to be healthy for years to come!
Didn't you left alex
👍🥰
I would add some more sound deadening to that room if you guys are going to record more video's in there it's a bit echo-y
The hood vents on Phil look sick, Alex!
The audio could be a bit better for a 3M subs channel. :)
It’s a good day when car throttle uploads 🥰
Yee-eees this is one of my favourite things!
Love that the roast is back!
Love these vids
