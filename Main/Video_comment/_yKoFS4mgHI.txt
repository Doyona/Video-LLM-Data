16 KEEPERS IN 16 MINUTES WITH 16 MILLION VIEWS.

You knew that billy gonna score😂. They are just to good. 1:48
stop copping abdallah ramdan
Me whatching this in 2025
16th keeper enters and keeps a cleansheet.
Why not 80 keepers? As long as they are all standing in the muddle of the goal, it doesn’t do much difference between on, two or 100. Weak.
Anyone can tell me what shoes Jeremy is wearing?
Join Barcelona
I’m watching in 3029
This video is with 16 keepers and has 16 million views

I guess if they spread on the goal line they will have far better chances to defend but I guess they need money too right?
Ronaldo is the best player in the world

POV: Uruguay in the 2010 WC Quarter-finals against Ghana
14:15 Did Jeremy say he's going to sacrifice himself kamikaze style!?!?
Its more like 1 keeper with 15 people in front of him ...

Boume Sama scored on 20 keepers
16 gokep
Dumbs
Nice
Literaly football at my school
The YouTuber BouméSama realized 20keepers, look this vidéo brothers😉
That hard
Literal les tapo más Courtois que los 16 arqueros
Bro is kopy Tudor Butan from Romania
Put a part 2
Why didn't the goalies all line up across the net so they don't score
imagine will be 1000 golkeeper  wow thats a lot
As a goalie myself, this would be an absolute nightmare to try to block. My vision would horrible with all the people in the way
i miss you
bro scored against Courtois
2:56 this is the moment when you will find out about the existence of the camera man
Boume Sama scored against 20 keepers
It is a bullshit the keepers can do this because they are too many, they depends each other and the position where are they standing it's Disturbed to the man in the back to see where the ball go
Just stupid, no one of them is standing in the corner of the goal.
Useless video
Why didn't they just spread apart across goal , any keeper can jump up at save , 6 goalies going middles seems a bit odd .
Why the hell they are not standing side by side
https://youtube.com/shorts/e1cCATQ_6Nk?feature=share
This is click bait. All they have to do is line up across the goal and start up. And no one can score. Senseless video. Stupid goalies 😂
Horrible positioning from the goalkeepers.
11 keepers is called Serie A
hi whıch camera use?
Why don't they just stand all along the line?
400
POV: you play against Atlético de Madrid
The goalies aren’t trying. You can tell based off their positioning
This is bullshit. Unrecommending
This is stupid- why wouldn't the goal keepers stand at the corner posts. Clearly staged lol
why all those keepers standing in the middle and than jumping for the ball to the side XD stand in a line wtf
keepers are guys just standing there? lol wtf
Next vid... you guys against a corrupt referee...
Keepers  is  win😃
I’m feeling generous today 😊. Comment below if you want to get credited $100 on your CashApp without any upfront payment ❤️ ✌️.
Who’s idea is this? That much keeper is no point at all, if really want test I think 3 is enough to stop the ball. Why don’t u put 20 or 30 keepers? Non sense….
all line up straight lmfao
u should get Cal the dragon into the goal :D
3 keepers are enough if they cover the  left, center and right. Those 16 were in the same place leaving the corners free.
How hard is it to assign two of them to only cover the top corners lol
what a joke video. They can't score against 1 keeper.. oh by the way 1:41, slow the speed to 0.25 and watch the keeper avoid intercepting the ball.
16? 🙄 Zlatan can score against 60 goalkeepers.
now without teenagers goalkeepers
12:52 did the guy on the right glitch?
Are these guys pros ?
Why all the keepers are in the middle? they can make a barrier where they don't even need to move, but somehow they decide to be in the same place one after the other
Hh
14M Views and 14M Subscribers
Lol
Boys club
The fact that the vid is also 16 mins 💀💀
Me personally
Omg it's the tiktoker that I always watch
More topins then Messi & Ronaldo
Isnt the smart idea to put 2 keepers at the posts???
여긴 매번 뭔가 나중엔 가라네 좀ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 저리 세워두면 인원 추가된 의미가 전혀안보이네 띄워서 까면 앞에는 의미 일도없음ㅋㅋㅋ
16 gp VS R.CARLOS ?
Man, what’s the purpose of having many goalkeepers in the middle. Just 3 keeps with proper spacing with be hard to beat
they are not keepers bro
Hi
Vim do reversão
What is rhe name of the white and pink predator boots? P S reply omg i love it
Why are the keepers so stupid
And guess what views is equal to subscribers - 14M😂.
No matter how many keepers you put in, if they all stand in the middle, doesn’t really matter if there’s one or 10 🙄
At what point are the keepers just playing as defensive players lol
So sickkkkkkkkkkk

7:46
Totally
You can tell it’s an amazing strike when no goalkeepers even try to get it
You scored on your # 11 try in 11 or 12 keepers
You can say that again
Keepers biggest mistake is thinking it will miss. Don't think - jump.
You are great footballers. YOU ARE THE BEST FOOTBALLERS
I LOVE YOUR VIDIOES!!!!!!!!!
Make cr7 shoot

How much did the goalkeeper save in this football match.
Your so good
Why did all of the keepers stand in a clump and not stand by the sides of the goal where the shots were coming in?
do 26 goalie keepers pls and that was amazing
Great
This is how many goalkeepers real  needed vs barca
Can you guys come to South Africa and play for my team Orlando Pirates because they’re struggling here😭😭😭
20 keepers with decoy and rebounds from keepers or the posts
Guy in right corner so bad …
Imagine playing your whole team as keepers and not keeping a cleansheet :)
Fking views money
Interesting
0:00
Just make a wall right in front of the goal
What’s boots is Jeremy wearing?
Enjoyed at  all its best. But truth be told,  Freestlers  simply tucked goalies into centre corners wide open
👌 of course if keepers are lined-up, it makes the challenge less difficult. 🍍 Verumy entertaining  session though. Thanks
Actually the keepers are in the middle and the keepers in the back can't see the ball coming so its an advantage for the shooters 💀💀
Bruh why is all the Keeper in the center - why not at the left or right side of goal post
When the ball went in versus 14 keepers, it was like Matrix 3 when Neo left the fight and you had 1000 Agent Smiths all staring at each other thinking why didnt you stop him.
This challenge need Ronaldo and messi
Boumé Sama did 20 Keepers he beated you
All the amazing goals that would be recordé in history if these guys was pro bro 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
The shooters are pro or GK's are idiot...why didn't they all just stand on the goal line sideways...They won't score even a single goal even if there are only three
f2: tells us not to doubt the keepers they have the keepers they have: makes us doubt the keepers they have
Damn, what are those boots?

JEREMY
Screaming like wee Lassies scoring into 14yr old Goalkeeper’s. 😂😂😂
Lol

Damma a
Mr top bins
Watched it 3 times
Im sorry, but these goalkeepers aren’t approaching this properly. They gotta position themselves in certain positions. Like 1 keeper per corner. And like 2 watching the middle. Realistically 5 should be able to block 99% of all shots. What are they doing leaving the top bins open?? Absolute rubbish.
Exactly
i love how the vid is 16 minutes long and there are 16 keepers 🤣
Dont play with my friend or else you'll cough out your esophagus.
Next time can u add some girl keepers to this
Hi
Lol
These guys are insane.😃
Would love to see Son and Kane
Ronaldo is good but I perfere messi
probaly becuase at the points where they could easily save it they dont to move the video on
Ronaldo shof  din  the  palo  do
Good one
04:42 Why would 5 keepers stand RIGHT in the centre? lol. Stupid.
I support Man City is it ok
F2 big fan I was if could join it soccer team I will send u a video of how I play
Bruh
But they were 11 and I am 10
I did 20 keepers they were saying I was bad so I told them to be the keepers and then I juked them all out and then made the shot
is that the tsubasa ball nice
Karaca
Geart job Billy and Jeremy
YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST
i am alsow left foot
Gooooooo goaliekepper
Lock Jezzin the container
Lock Jess in the container 😹
I was at a football match yesterday and i can score against 19 keepers
billy scored most of them
Next time do 25 keepers⚽️
hi
Come on Jezza!
16 th goalkeeper  was like "can I go home " are you all done 😅
wow
.
wow bro 16 keepers you won't score against anyways great football game.
Wow!!!! Amazing
I thought that if Billy did a Trivela, it would have been unexpected.
Good goalkeepers for once, but still F2 done very well
You are good
Nice player and goal keppers
Wow you gise were amazing sea you on the rea match
is this your frafrou fidyo
how are you so good?
kenapa kamu tidak ikut club sepak bola
If neuer was în this challenge:Too easy to save
Their are no trained goalkeepers like you guys that's why you can easily goal after 2 or 3 try
The fact that this is 16 min makes it even better.
Imagine Barca against PSG I close match will be
How are you guys so good at soccer I wish I was so good at soccer
Nice change♥️♥️🌹😭👋👋🤭👋
Can I be in your  video
Jeremy lynch should come with his avengers set
How many gold have you scord
You have the most sails I have ever seen from Jamie
Was it hard  Billy and jezer
If the all stood on the goal line you wouldn't be scoring pathetic
Ok ❌ Owkey✔️
Can you please face 36 keepers
Wasting of time ⏲ 😒
billy...now that i watch you look like Hazard
Are your soccer balls and boots original or fake
Why didn't they spread out...
This is obviously staged and they told the goalkeepers how to line up. If just 3 goal keepers line up in the line with one on each side and one in the center these guys would never score
Ayo the 10gk goal was the Best how did you make that
16 kaleci = 1 İsmail çipe
кто с России?
Nice challenge dude l love it guys
If you guys look at 5:40 seconds watch closely to the ball it glitched 0n the blue container
Just wondering how many of them might have gotten a ball to the face
That 16th keeper is Kieran brown and he ain’t a keeper 😂😂
Тупость, почему надо вставать друг за другом, когда можно стоиять на одной линии
only keep one guy on each side, simple... so stupid
How do you strike what bit of your foot
Neo vs Agent Smith :)
caco
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rO3KeISFVzQ&t=3s
Clickbait
It is easier for them to score 16 keepers than t courtois
This video is fantastic
f2 can score backheel against 2 keepers but Sakka can't score against 1
They talk weird.
Average Lewandowski training session
But you have clearly told them where to stand. So it's a bullshit challenge really. I can score against however many keepers I want if I could tell them where to stand.
It's more fun to watch the keepers scramble... Imagine the keepers on a "V" form. They would just jump straight and raise their hands to save.
This is actually pretty difficult for the keepers. More the worse... They are blocking each other's vision... 🤦🏽‍♂️
Get Reese a contract.
2 grown 30 year olds vs 16 teenage boys
🤣😂
Accuracy 120%
All standing in the middle . Pointless
It’s quiet funny how sometimes they stair at the ball
Back two guys rarely move when the ball is kicked in the corner hahahaha oh well. Still good ball strikers 💪
https://youtu.be/tXPKzk3qdhY
Where is the dislike button? or bring me “just one good keeper”..
Bruh Bad keepers ngl just one euch top and bottom corner and the others for the middle and its done
Bruh 5 keepers but All standing close to euch othrr xD
Dia Bukan Tidak Jago Tapi Dia Takut Dengan Bola Yang Begitu Cepat, Kalo Di Indonesia Takut Kejebret
Chutiya bana rhe h
Chutiyapa
Everyone stand in the middle and also try not to save it...
احبك
what the point if most of the goalkeepers in the front and the left and right side of the goal are open?
keepers? xD😅
What is the point of all of them are standing one behind the other...ppl at the back can't even see.
What a bullshit...
Improvement suggestion: light up soccer ball with fire then kick it!
hm.... can i ask why there is 1 girl between 15  males ?  🤨🤨🤨🤨
Yes, but can you guys do it against 16 ducks!!
Well after the 5th goalkeeper... everything was setup. So I skipped

Less video, more BS
Stupid goalkeepers.
10:20hat er scheiße gesagt

بیشتر دربازه بان ها مثل یه بشکه بودن، من خودم دربازه بان هستم و سر در میارم هرچن از اون شوت ها نمیشه گذشت
دربازه بان های بی عرضه
I really enjoyed the vid and The goalkeepers were great but when they were increasing they needed to stand in the corners 👀! As you can see 4:55 🔥 🔥
what is this? click bite? or what? where from you gust take those ''goalkeepers''? sale in Asda? I seen better keepers in Sundayleague...

That was good I think you can do it next time
Who has been watching f2 freestylers since their first messi vs Ronaldo video?and still watches them ?     Amazing channel guys you have never disappointed keep it up!
Its funny how they don't know to posing with another goalkeeper
hello
Do knuckle shot
16 goal keper 16 minute
F2:- 2 free-kick strikers with 16 gks Me:- trying to convince my friend for being gk for 5mins.
how about it tho, 16 keepers in 16 minutes
3:11 WHAT A GOAL
On 11 keepers there were 11 shots taken before a goal which is one over limit so technically they failed the challenge
Do 1O pro goalkeepers, like donarumma, neuer, Allison,ter stegen,courtois,ederson, mendy from Chelsea,de Gea,onana from Ajax,And oblak from atletico

Ma quanto sono scarsi quei portieri🤣
12:32 Jeremy lynch actually does a bad shot for once 😯😯 am shocked, first time i've seen it
اول عربي😂✨
Not being funny but the positioning of the keepers is shocking when there are more of them.  When there was 5 they were all pretty much central meaning the sides of the goals were an easy hit still.
Love your videos.
💪🏼
This song goes crazy🔥 man used ocean eyes sample https://youtu.be/Q4Ap09w_HGI
The goalkeepers keep blocking the ball then it takes them about four shots then they make it.
They are beasts I will not mess with them lol they are to good for 14 goalkeepers.
How many times you hit the cross bar ????????????
YOU ARE GOOD
Jeremy lynch
i turned off when they made all the keepers stand in the centre. joke
Hi f2
Was Kieran Brown one of the goalies
Isn't this Jeremy lynch the funny tiktok guy😊
To F2 Give you self impossible challenges and your bound to get one right and that would be you best football
Billy’s voice was getting tired when he was saying yes
If you said all goalies are ine the middle try it
Every keeper that's a yard off his line is already beaten and blocking the actual keepers vision 3 keepers on the line well organised no chance ⚽️
You mean 16 kids standig there like morons then yes
you are legends
There are all bad
Get some keepers over 5 foot
25 keppers pease
I have the same cleaks
Video is sixteen minutes long

Cambridge United!!!!!

Cambridge!!!!
U scored lots because there’s woman keepers
Can you do a 50 goalkeeper

If it was 16 Donnaruma of Neuer…
Hi
It was insane. you both are machine.
One thing is for sure. These aren"t very good goal keepers.
The wall against
Football sound little bit weired
SCRIPTED
Bro i don't have football shoes
This reminds me about Nikey( last game ad)
This is what defending is like in fifa 22
John Arne Riise would be proud with some of those goals . Screamers
Este reto hubiera estado bueno para cr7 o Messi pero con porteros de verdad (no necesariamente profesionales) no con estos pinches costales
Join premiere league vro
The pose at 1:50 tho 🥶🥶🥶
how about spending some time studying physics?
Is this Dave Beckhams younger brother?
The fun part is that they are planning like they are gonna kidnap the princess
Man! where the hell did you find 16 goalkeepers? At my pick up games we have trouble finding 1 then having to do last down!
Jesus love you, he died on the cross for you, accept him as your lord and savior he can change everything. For God so loved the world that he gave his only son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life" (Jn 3:16"  But you must repent too. From that time Jesus went about preaching and saying, Let your hearts be turned from sin, for the kingdom of heaven is near. (Matthew 4:17)'
They should have just made a wall and guarded  there very little area
That screams 😂😂😂
let me join on 17
You boys should stand in the center while we shoot at the corner of the goal post  #easiest  challenge of the year
Left shoot danger
You guys are bad at shooting
Fake, keepers told where to stand. Absolute Bell ends!
14:08
😐
When video is scripted not a single goal is impossible 🙄
Jerm lýnch
Wait, is that savage dad?🤣
Next challenge: Scott Sterling
I can't even score with no keepers
How do u kick it in the side but it goes in the goal
Think this is a load of S### all standing in the way of each other easier than scoring against 1 keeper 😂😂👍🏽
More like 16 dumb keepers.
Us are good
16 ręczników a nie bramkarzy 😅
100 keepers plis
Did anyone seen that the video is 16 min and 16 goalies
Damn that's some low power shooting
11:20 song name plsssss
What a joke! Only the back row at the sides are doing anything
If the keepers weren't just stood in the middle of the goal, this would've been over after 4 goalies
Why are they all standing in the middle of the goal?
Who ever spot a puyol in the keepers 😆
https://youtu.be/RUIkQICp0Pg
16 keepers but looks like 2 only 😂
Son unos muy buen tiros pero se pueden dar mejor
❤💙👍
просто бесполезные вратари
Lot of keepers and still stand in the middle. Pure stupidity.
Coba nyebar.
They are  not goalkeepers just random stranglers or people u found ..They not even trying... People just watch anything Now days do they ..Nice shoots though
Just stay as a line and block the goal entirely for god's sake. There are 16 of you. I mean come on!
Did Beckham had an unknown son
Utterly useless Video
super
The way the ball moves in the air is so satisfying. And also when the keepers dive for the ball
15 stupid goalkeepers !  😞
This is bulllshit
11:09 он на русском сказал ЛУЧШИЙ ГОЛ?
This video was really stupid.....you know why 👍
Them balls got some heat on em sheesh
Everyone in the comments talking about how flawed this experiment is... we all know and so do they. It's for the spectacle and the title.
I was just here to watch jeremy lynch lmao
F2 are as big as the sidemen? Mad. I didn't know that.
What version of english language is spoken here.....i cant hear a thing
Most keepers are not of the same quality as set piece takers.
Is all good when there's no pressure but I bet these are useless in a proper match
To save you time, 14:08 is where there are 16 keepers 👍
De qué sirve poner todos los porteros juntos en linea recta y apelotonados??. así como si pones 30  Con poner 3 en paralelo con la portería, a ver quien clava una.
Scripted.
The first goalie is really good, rest unhhhh. They keep shooting the other side and most good saves are from the first keeper itself.
I had to stop watching how staged and set up this was. All keepers all in the middle. Come on. What bullshit. Either they’ve told them keep the sides open or the keepers are very silly not being spread out over the goal. It’s set up and staged. Only good good for a 1 year old to watch. Disappointing
This is crazy
Is that Jeremy Lynch?!?!?!?
Dump goals
The positions of the keepers are dumb they needed to stand by and they hold every ball
One of thier shots is literally the equivalent of the best shot I've ever made!... and they do it over and over again against 15 keepers! Love the F2! Ya'll are awesome.
It is mean that many doctors , child die.
Aq biz halısaha ya q kaleci bulamıyoruz adamlar 16 sini birden kaleye sokuyor 13.5 m takipçi olmamız gerekiyor herhalde
Nothin perfect
They have gone there whole life and they have gone to far
I always thought jess was Jeremy lynch
stupid  challenge just for the views this is easy all the keepers are standing at the same place 4:48 and so
Like scoring against nick pope on fifa
How embarrassing would it have been if they'd have gone out in the first round.
2 guys having fun - 16 guys waiting annoyed for when it's over, finally
3:19 that shooot❤️
Hi
166 keepers in a row, I also score a goal
Imagine not being from Cambridge
الااتااسننننب
Şaddaklık.
These Freestylers have better finishing than the guys of the crappy german channel Freekickerz.
Why 16?
Even you put 100 all were standing at the middle of the post. That left and right corner is always empty and they can keep scoring. Don’t say toughest challenge
What if you were the first goalie and got scored on 15 times?
16 but all center position ,,this is setting condition lok
Y
why they all in the middle
Just gave channel name freestyler but in real then just normal player
You all are just normal player who play football in freetime
I don't think you all are freestyler because freestyler have trick to shoot
Kiper surih di tengah semua kocak nih
Lah, si madun juga bisa kalo gini mah
16 player= 16 mins
These keepers are so bad that if they can't be in top team like Liverpool and man city. 😂  Why you play with these trash player.
Normally hard enough to find one keeper let alone 16
سبحان الله وبحمده سبحان الله العظيم
صلي علي النبي عليه افضل الصلاة والسلام
I feel for the lady goalkeeper in front.
Wow this is so crazy I think this is how Messi and Ronaldo practice lolz
Agreed to the hundreds of comments on the "Multiple Goalies" at the nets. Its pointless and stupid. Doesn't make this challenge any more difficult. Or maybe yes more difficult, but towards the goalkeepers blocking their own view. Dislike.
Só chuta no meio KKKKKKK
That would be hard
They had to line up like bowling pins. At least have 1 in each corner. Idiots
È molto ovvio che 16 messi in quella posizione si fanno ostruzione l'uno con l'altro ed è solo più facile segnare...non è che siete bravi voi.. poi sono tutti bambini.. basterebbe metterne uno FORTE magari della vostra età per non farvene fare neanche uno.....
Why are they all standing in the middle of the goal? That's like having only one keeper. Therefore, the challenge doesn't mean anything. You're basically just scoring against one keeper.
ASHISH
Not bad savage dad
Should put a few premier league strikers taking the shots!!   would that make a difference???
♥️
These guys are beasts
Very amateur keepers👎👎👎👎

The camera man just fucks this video up
For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast them into hell and committed them to chains of gloomy darkness to be kept until the judgment; (2peter2:4) - Because he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed; and of this he has given assurance to all by raising him from the dead. (Acts17:31) For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. 17 For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. (‭‭John‬ ‭3‬‬:‭16-17‬) Jesus loves you, he’s waiting for you to repent and put your faith and trust in Him 🙂
Nice

Bullshit nothing 0% challange

Hi liked that please
lol with the amount of keepers one could just stand in each corner i mean the vido is obviously staged and made easier for the schooters
test Ronaldo kick like that with his hard kick
are you more of a lefty or righty?
This is basically a close range free kick Gaelic football 😄
Why this guy not has been taken to world football🤔 he has more skill
POV:most of the people can even get through 1
Maybe three keeper are enough to defend.
They could have brought Dr. Strange instead.😂
Can yall make a vid how to shoot like yall pls
jeremy is better tictoker
The keppers are so bad, an ancient can do it better
This is how many keepers man united should have if they actually want to win a game
Why are they all standing in the middle of the goal? That's like having only one keeper. Therefore, the challenge doesn't mean anything. You're basically just scoring against one keeper.
Why 15 when you could've just had cal the dragon? 🐉
I thought the thumbnail said 16k keeper 😅
I'm surprised a keeper didn't take a rocket to the chops or that two keeps didn't clash head to head.
good vid
You are amazing bro
that's bare keepers
1 keeper in the middle and 2 keepers on the sides it would be enough
Video: 16 keepers. Video length: 16 minutes. Me: even in 16 years I want be able to play like this
Why are they all standing in a line? Have they been told this I assume?
Why dont they line up next to eachother? This video was below expectations
POV: your coach hasn’t arrived to practice yet

wats the point having all the 16 keepers in the middle of the goal, its just like having one keeper
Wtf why the goal keepers are not standing in edges
Why does this dude look like Jeremy Linch
Pros and should be in the premier League
Most boring yet interesting video
这几个门将控制范围和反应都不如我
I can guarantee you that many of those shots would have been saved had the been 1 goalkeeper instead of that many. More keepers just get in eachother way. No-one understands goalkeeping apart from goalkeepers, not just for this reason though. I talk about this to my coach so much.
The corners wide open.
tutoria like kick?
F2 you guys are amazing
Can't they just make a wall
Why would you do 20 if you can’t do 16?

Hi Jeremy
CAN YOU MAKE A VLOG WITH 100 GOAL KEEPERS IN THE GOAL AND YOU HAVE TO GET A GOAL SO MORE KEEPERS CAN GO IN THE GOAL
Can you mute the voices on the replays next time ? Hard to enjoy the great goals with the screaming 😅
Bill with the deadly left  The other dude rolls the ball for every shot...

Plot twist : The F2 has told all the keepers to stand in the between the blue lines No goal can be scored otherwise after 4 keepers of good level
Wait he is Jeremy lynch
Next challenge, widen the keepers..😂😂
legend watching in 2021
Ciao
Was that intentional the video being 16 minutes and there being 16 goalkeepers
This is a stupid video...all the gk are standing in the centre...make them stand next to each other
If the 16 keepers were allowed to go at the side of the net then the f2 would've lost at 5 keepers
Totally scripted
i spend most of the time on "recording"😥 ,  "editing😥" and "uploading". i need my supporters.🙏
https://youtu.be/3MKvxG_dfvY Relaxing Rain sounds to relax your mind and improve your mind
Can I ask one thing is it scripted 😏🙄

That’s a lot of gingers
Is it just me or does Billy resemble David Beckham a bit?
Nice video friend 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷
Mezzanine
I feel like it'd be harder the more keepers you have (harder for the keepers)
1:16 is definitely a goal. Stop the video on 1:16.
Good
fire🔥
LAAMOOO🤣🤣
Why are all goalkeepers in the middle of the goal?
5:28 όχι ρε
Do the 16 GK challenge but with Helium, surely a test for both you and the Keepers!
Why don’t all of them just line up on in the goal line lol
كفو
I don't understand why all the goalkeepers are crowding the middle part of the pitch. CHEATING!!! Lol
20
Shaolin soccer⚽
Jez always has to go in the semi circle and get closer lol his power just is not on par with Billys
Haha
i want you to do20 keepers
no
Even 15 keepers didnt beat these amazing footballing duos!!!
Lynch, get off that high horse kid.
its finally good to see the keeper getting paid to actually try
This just shows there skill level.
All these keepers are probably 70 rated but there so much more than that   On fifa
You guys are the best All the clubs should beg for you
BILLY
Umm.. Bit off-topic but is it only me that thinks Billy looks almost identical to David Beckham just without all the tattoos?
Unbelievable 😯😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😯😯😯😯😯😮😯😮😯😮😯😮😯😮😮😯😯😯😮😮😯😮😯😮😯😮😯😮😯😮😯😮😯😮😯😯😯😯😮😯😮😯

I love how there was 16 keepers and the vid was 16 min😂
I think they can be better than Neymar junior
To me: It’s a lame one
Nice shot fella
ladies and gentlemen, here is the match against PSG
Good
Why were they all huddled up together instead of just lining up to make it harder?! Seems proper scripted.
What a idiots omg
Billy and Jez need to dribble the keepers cus there’s too much keepers😂
Billy looks like hazard anbody
The right foot kick better
Y they r standing together
How do they hire these guys from pro clubs Pickford is therer
Put soccer on tik tok plz
Interesting 🤗
if you were a pro footballer you would have been sanchez
The goalkeepers in front are useless
You all are cheating.why the goalkeepers stand together, they should stand in a straight line across the goal
🙂
This deserves many more likes
15 goalkeepers and you still score you couldn’t do 16 but where are these keepers coming from
These keepers are trash there are literally 5 or more and they still can’t save honestly it’s ridiculous
I can't even do 3 XD Good job! I did not waited that good. This video deserves to become a viral
Shots from leg foot guy🔥🔥
if only england had one of those keepers
Have to feel bad for the 16th keeper having to wait that long
Good shot
i don't know if those goal keepers are completely retarted or are just instructed to stay in one line and act like idiots
You guys must play dream league soccer 2021
Did you tell them to just stay in the middle before you shoot
idiots they are standing in middle ofcourse you will score..if they would be spread in goal you cant score to 3 goalkeepers🤦‍♀️🤡🤡
Let hulk shooting
most of ppl cant do a goal vs 1 person them have more then 14
In your country the goalkeepers aro so bad this is approved
Siuuuuuuuuuu
They all are standing in one place
16 poopers
World of an applause..

I love these challenges🤣🤣
Try shooting against 16 PL keepers
Finally they have nice goal keepers cause the others don't even try like some shots even a 4 year old could save it lol
Someone: saves a shot Billy: i liKe ThAT
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
This is a good econ lesson on diminishing marginal returns...
Liverpool  needs  1,500 goalkeepers
16 because they failed at 17 ;)
Is it just me or did most of them look like Pickford?
Jeremy Lync you are my idol
уже неизвестно
To be honest only the last line 4 goal keepers are doing all the saving others are like when do we touch the ball 🤣😂
Can we get a shooting tutorial on different ways to shoot a ball by both of you
You called cr7😂😂😂
if they stand side to side, 5 keepers is enough to cover the whole post. But if they all are standing in the centre in front of each other, a shot to the corner with enough power cannot be blocked by even 20 keepers 13:05 see the gap they have left for them to score even with bout 15 keepers
3 keepers would have been enough to stop them if they letter them take position they wanted.
I would pay to be one of the keepers for them ngl.. just like you wanna face good keepers as a striker, you dream of facing amazing strikers as a keeper..
16 keepers and 16 minutes in the video
great video

Everyone thought 2 goalkeepers was hard...
Love you guys you made me play football you make it look easy but it’s hard thx so much
Sometimes the goalie can get some good saves but other than that they cant get past F2
was fun watching this video
No way he makes a goal
why didnt the keepers just stand in a line reaching their hand up?
how do you guys get so good?!
What boots is billy wearing

Lol. Might aswell just ask the gk to line up one straight line in the middle of the goalpost.
Keepers must stand separately then can do standing in a row is not protection  of saving from goals
This is kinda like the bystander effect. The bystander effect, or bystander apathy, is a social psychological theory that states that an individual's likelihood of helping decreases when passive bystanders are present in a situation.
I feel bad for the 16th keeper bc he has to watch them have fun while he is waiting to get put in
Ma hanksh bothennnnnnnnn

some of the keppers were really good billy and jezza must be so good. do they have a contract to a club

If you do this challenge again you can shoot a quick back to back shot so that if a keeper try’s to dive for it and blocks the first shot the second shot will go in and the diving keeper will be in the way of the other keepers

6:38 they all turned their heads at the same time
Beastsss
16 keepers 16 min video
If we took a shot of tequila for every time Billy says ‘top bins’ we would be dead mid-video.
goalkeepers are braindamaged
Guess were gonna see that rematch
even my granny would have scored with this line up of goallies even with 25 goallies and her walking rack..some or almost outta da box and they cheer like they won the CL
F2 vs 2 world class keepers
I swear lil T was a goalie in this
هل من شخص عربي ياولد 😝
The thing is these are youth keepers theres no way your getting past 3 prime buffons
I alone would have been okay
Where did you buy all these footballs
I cant even score agaisnt no keepers
Throw your X up!!
The quaint cardigan superfamily rub because custard neuropathologically increase into a round yew. awake, brave skin
They missed ten shots at 11 keepers
They al look like wacht other
timo werner should accpet this challenge
Malayali mar undo like adi

*Nepal have Great Footballers, But we are not getting any support to Show our Performances* 😭😭😭😭
This training session was inspired on the One that atletico Madrid uses 🤣🤣🤣
Good
looks like he miss something 11:55
Iaiaka
These keepers are amazing 👏
That’s so spectaculary !
That is easy
9:00 when your team has got 9 red cards and it’s just you and your mate to score against them
idu what thees keepers was doing
One shot = a dozen goalkeepers on the ground
Why the keepers in front why don't they spread out duhhh
16 keepers en16 minnets
What if you make it 15 goal keepers and 15 shooters, it will be a barrage of shots.
This is like mission impossible movies it says it's impossible but by the end we all know it's possible LoL
Why Could t the goalies just get it a line
Anyone here after 13 mil
90% of the video I hear THATS THE ONE
Billi has some hell of a power in that left foot, and its all just techniue. Pure Tekkers
Make a 9 vs 9 with the keepers on field and you in the goal!
2:21 call an ambulance
Magic in air
5:00 ال خمس حراس عم يصورو
Just one word impossible😂
Any malayalis
That set up of goalkeepers is soo trash......spread in triangle shape, no ball shall get through
20 keepers would be really easy
NO GOAL 🥅
you'll know the ball goals in when the music become more intense
All fine were just standing in the same spot in the middle hah why
come on cambridge les gooo
i didn’t understand for a second i thought it was turn to turn
Only billy is scoring 😭
Where do they find so many keepers 😂
that's what Tottenham need
Italian pizza 🍕🍕🍕🍕🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹
Messi watching right now
You 2 guys are amazing but why the fk those 16 goalkeeper stayed in the middle lol 😂 nice planned
This is how many times F2 hit the crossbar 👇.                                                   look at the views
Billy look like Beckham
when the beat drop comes you already know they scored it
Y
At the one only with the 1 keeper Them:hit all of them Goalkeeper:saves 1 Them:nice man
Is it just me or does Billy look like Chris Pratt in this video
God love you in Thailand
5:29 ΟΧΙ ΡΕ

👌👌👌👍👍
Gzummoin
H
why they are standing in one pleas
Nice
Bro is that Billy or Hazard
Oh! may god 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️ So so beautiful 😍
Not to take away from these guys fantastic skills, but after a few keepers, just adding more to the middle doesn't increase the difficulty that much. The corners are still wide open. And half the keepers can't see anything haha. Was still impressive and fun to watch.
Fake
keepers are paid artists
tik tok
AWWW WHAT A SAFE
You guys are amzaming
اتمنى اشتراك في قناتي على اليوتيوب

Top class keepers my ass

Should have invited modern goalkeeping lol
the goalies should have kept a  formation
4:46 keeper are like synchronize robots
Of 4 keepers stand on the same line it will be impossible to score lmao
How much did you pay them ? 😂
Ennit billy looks like eden hazard
16 keepers and 16 minutes
Imagine 16 kepas in there!

16 goalies standing in the middle hasn’t so much different with a single one
Sickest footballers I’ve ever seen
Please try the glass chalange of ronlado
I think you are best shotest ability in the world
Corona be like ._.
I love how if Billy/ Jezza put it top bins and the keepers don’t move
Shoot through 🔥 please
The keepers are dumps they just should make a line and they will defend the goal for sure
Me thinking these men shoots better than Messi and Ronaldo 😭😭😭😭
Instead get one pro keeper...this is just chaotic
Fantastic
with  16  goalkeepers   is  so  hard
I love how all the keepers are resting while 1 keeper is working his butt off
is  to  hard  for  you  guys  you  guys  are   storng     don  t  give   up   f2
The 11th one looks like goalie from kungfu hustle
Literally no one:   Me: Billy kinda looking like bonucci ngl
https://youtu.be/bTcdETsIBQA
As a keeper I say that the first one wasn’t good because of he’s technic
why are all the keepers in the middle of the goal? Isn't it easier to defend if they were distributed in "areas" of the goal?
You are a good footballer, please join in a football club please 😅😅😅😁🤔👌👀👌🏽👍🏻👍🏼👋🏽👍🏻
Join in la liga please 😂😂😀😋😋😅😄
Roberto Carlos pretty sure smile take a look at this challenge.. 🤣🤣🤣

Why are the keepers clumped in the centre? That makes it much easier for them to score
Part 2. I cannot wait for the rematch 👑👑👑😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥💯💯🔥❤️🥳🎊🔥🔥❤️🔥💯💯
My heart was beating very fast when the 16 goalie came.
It is hard to beat one keeper. How can they beat 16 keepers?
If you do it you get a subscribe
Just imagine If there were÷ Oblak , Alisson , Ederson , Neuer , David de gea , Ter Stegen , Courtois and Navas
5:13 his look like a Neymar and game also like this
100 keeper billy and jezza please do
Billy if you had a twin it would be eden hazard
These are looking like the formation that like in bahubali last fight 😂😂😂😂😂
seems quite socially distance
thats like IMPOSSIBLE dude
Has anyone noticed look closely at the thumbnail there is only 14 goalkeepers 🤣😅😂
F2 are pros truly!

Bro there is only 3 keeps all of the others dont do anything this is clickbait
These keepers play for clubs?? Most of em don't even move for the shot...
How much do they pay the keepers to let the ball in🤔🤔🤔
I want one football nitrogen one which you you f2  Btw love from india
This reminds me of when Neymar was up against all of the bots in the Nike animated commercial
I have the same boots as jezza           Wise man
Professional 3 GKs are more than enough to keep you on zero guys. A gk without a plan is nothing. None of them are standing with a plan and are leaving the gap for scorer. Regards from unknown GK.
You should’ve faked a shot
Easy
Hi
Amazing videos guys well done ,I really can't wait for more
CSM 🤣
F2:great saves lads love that   There head : get out the the way and let us score

Did you know it is 16 minutes
6:52 since when did mahrez become a goalie
Superb Conversion Rate!! by Billy Wingrove got nearly all of the goals Awesome Goals by him!! Jeremy Lynch nowhere near his Goals Tally!!

Jezz give it an old knuckleball
The aberrant action immediately paddle because freeze aetiologically turn on a steadfast aftermath. petite, mighty hyena
Ronaldo and Messi👀
Anybody know what shoes they are wearing
Number nine magic goal
They are not scoring a single goal if they are in a row
Could'nt they have lined up on the the line and just jump. Or maybe make two rows of keepers, one row jumps, the second one just stands still.. wouldnt that be nearly impossible to score against? 🤓🤔
And the vid is 16 mins long lol
crazy man cool
90°
Assalamualaikum
Next time put different goals. It would be even more interesting.
The last goalie always has fun
Goal achieved! Hundred thousand likes 👍. Now go again. We need 20 keepers this time, let's go Billy n Jezza⚡!
*cringiest and disrespectful video ever*
Lol putting all the keepers in the straight line
Go against 16 keepers at once like all of the keepers in front of the goal and I want to see if your good or bad
They should have crowded the goal like at the start
4;47 all five are standing behind each other how will they save or see the ball planned video
Why they all got the same trim😂😂😭😭 Brit boys
That keeper that caught the ball at 10:03 😱😍
Inglesi e americani:sono dei fenomeni hanno provato a mettere 16 portieri Italiani:zw lo ha portato per prima
hi
I wouldn't like 15 other goalkeepers getting in my way. Id have no problem playing agaisnt them :D
My practice session: https://youtu.be/84lBTi8AFlc  Will appreciate your time if you see and suggest some inputs
Make they 20.
but F2 IS BETTER THAN KEPERS
O
Nope keepers 👎
jezza have spoken tooooo soon when he was gonna score on the 16th keepers he spoke way too sooooooon
WGAR JEZZA WAS GONNNA SCORE ON THE 16TH KEEPER I THOUGHT I DID NOT EVEN NEED TO WATCH THIS VIDEO I WAS 100 PERCENT SURE THEY WOULD SUCESS THE CHALLENGE
What a script
You should have done your hammer kick
LMFAO looks so funny with 16 keepers in goal 🤣🤣🤣
I just watched a video of 2 people saying ' What a save' for 16 mins
Love from bangladesh
A kids maximum goals they can score against a goal keeper is 2 f2 maximum 💯 lol

This is how it feels like to have Neuer goalkeeping
Next time you guys have a goalkeeper Ask modern goalkeeping
Si ustedes tienen 12.1 millones de seguidores no son capaces de realizar el regalo de 12.1million de balones
You did better on 10 then 1
he really said start working calls
The only reason they scored the top and bottom corners was the gks were short
I bet their favourite sport is water polo
TRY AND TRY 20 GOELKEEPPERS NEXT TIME
AMAZINGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
Mantap
They are getting their goals because of they are placed forward not side side to protect the goals .❌
Who
Nice shot
Thats incredible
Next challenge vs 16 keepers : right footed to left , and left footed to right footed. If u pass , then u become a versatile player.
ไทย
Surprised lynch didn’t mention his car before the video kicked off

It would take my team around 37 keepers to win s tittle at my amateur league
Jezza kiiiiiiinda looks like van dijk And billy also slightly looks like Beckham

You should get pro keepers in football
ليش ماكو ترجمه للعربي 🤔
Modern goalkeeper wants to challenge you guys
16 keepers in 16 minutes Lmao 😂
12:38 🤯
16 goalies... That is INSANE!

Fake shot all of them 🤣
I don't like them
I love how some time every keeper dive to the same way and the other side is leave open
16
Cool, nice beautiful!
Come to Egypt mens
This is how many times they said great save.
this is some next level modding in f2
Why are they all in the middle? I would have guys on each post
The ball sounds like it's very heavy
Bill's left foot is an absolute weapon
Is it just me or does billy look like Eden hazard
SELATIN
Every 5 seconds “great save, love that.”
20
Reminds me of my elementary days during recess where it was girls vs boys and the girls needed their whole team as goalies to save our shots 😂😂
Billy 5:56 NES!!!!! A normal person:huh?
he cocky
Social distance man
cool.  f2

I seriously love this challenge!!
So true
Legend says it hard to get likes from f2 freestylers
Those are great gollkeapers
1:50 old f2 vibes kick in
Me  scoring  against 1 keeper is also difficult
I scored against 18 goalkeepers in college soccer
Like your cut billy
what the adidas top the black guy wearing anyone knows?
One courtois and you are all done
16 goal keepers more like 16 minute video
how much you DID pay them to eat the goals? As the system and positions that the goalkeepers taken is ridiculous. Some of them may be playing for first time. IF YOU WANT TO DO A CHALLENGE DO IT RIGHT! DO not set up a challenge. THANK YOU!!
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxNGD07fXrSqxYN6KJslolw
Neuer = 16 keepers
This is actually entertaining to watch keepers being cooperative between eachother
Hhhh

The video is named 16 goalkepers vs f2, video i 16min and 16sec  and thats a fact
You guys are really did do 13 🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐😛🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
At 6:20 you can see they three do everything at the same timing
How are the not mates off camera🤣🤣
Go on
*OOOHHH WHAT A SAVE*
when billy put it top bins on 9 keeps there heads just all bop around   october 2020
اصطورة
That is what happend to me in fifa 17  v Chelsea and when in and I was spurs
If the keepers were positioned well then they’d have been done after five goalie maybe four
Hi
The keepers literally have 0 iq
TÜRKİSHHHHHHHHH🏅🏅🏅
Seeing 16 goalkeepers in 16 minutes that's a coincidence.
Don't you talk about BARCELONA and lionel Messi is the greatest player in the world
Title : Shooting again 16 keepers   I saw how many minutes of the video : interesting,, Ohh lets watch it.
If you guys ever come to New York and wanna shoot a video on a crappy field I’m my jv goalkeeper and i can make almost any shot look amazing by how my diving is soooooo if you wanna im always down
Nice haircut billy I like your cut g
Sixteen goalceapers and sixteen minits
the first keeper is good
Seems unfair for the keepers lol
Billy is just too good he has shot power damn Jeremy has the placement
I dare you to do 25 keepers 😂
it is realy goob evan thoe i have not whached it
It doesn't matter if the goalies are pro cos Llorris Karius is a pro and look what he did in the UCL final
cool
The only thing I hear ever time the goalies block their shot.   Great save What a great save  Lol
if it was the professional Goalkeepers Like Marc Andre Ter Stegen, Manuel Neuer, Donnarumma, David De Gea, Thibaut Courtois, Keylor Navas, Hugo Lloris, Ederson, Sommer, Alisson Becker, Bernd Leno, Kasper Schmeichel, Nick Pope, Jordan Pickford, Jack Butland and Petr Čech.  Your Done Got That?
Why are they all bunched up what a waste of keepers. Should just one in centre, 1 either side and then 1 standing on each post to block out the corners, then layer the rest of keeper like that
العراب بانتظار التقليد الكول راح يقلد
F2 can beat 16 but Marcus rashford can’t even beat 1
How can u question the keepers in an f2 vid all those who say this u try and be the keeper
Challenge modern goalkeeping
Man put Mahrez in goal lol
Barca directors; let's discuss that horrible loss to bayern Quique setien; I begged Suarez to go in goal but he refused Directors ; both of u get out of here
Where were these goalkeepers when bayern thrashed barca
Quique setien needed these goalkeepers against bayern he should have put Suarez as goalkeeper coz he wouldn't have a problem holding the ball
we NEED more videos
bro
2019: 3 keepers wow 2020: 16 keepers
If the person on the right kicked left and the person on the left kicked right at the sametime that would be a goal most of the time
You know when their going to score because of the beat drop
When u dont pay the keeper 😂
14:13 you came for here for this
Dislikes in 4k😂😂😂
Thats true
Haha
Thank you all
wow😱 👍
did you guys used to play profetional soccer.
why didnt the keepers spread wide and instead kept lining up in the center? :S
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
TBH Billy is a better kicker he got the power and accuracy
Ive done 8 keepers in a smaller net though, but I was 9, and I made it
Why were all the keepers squishing together in one place while they can spread out to make the challenge harder?
Where’s the social distancing 🤣
13:52 all keepers look back
why are all the keepers in the middle?
Bagus sekali gais
F2: 16 keepers next to each other in one goal. Coronavirus: Am i a joke to you?
if u play so well then u must be selected in a international team....but unfortunately not selected🤣🤣🤣..lol....
That is basically how Atletico Madrid play
Now u know that the goalkeepers are also a big part of football
Anyone been watching them the whole time over lockdown
This is more like Defenders than keepers try having them all at the line of goal have them line up in a line
16 goalkeepers that's a lot
Nice shot
Y’all are the best
https://youtu.be/RWNbRpJhLa0
I 8-2 much
Covid distance: :v
This how meant goalkeepers to save my little girls shout
7:50-7:54 ho ho ho hoaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
Billy wingrove is literally messi
Getting complimented is probably the biggest sign you’ll get into an academy.
At least the keepers aren't 2 by 4 keepers 😂😂
Where tf did they find 16 kepas
Your insane billy and jezz
This how many times he said save ⬇️
Where is your,SOP
Maybe de gea enough to safe all of the shoots
Billy giving me David Beckham vibes
Hi billy I am a goalkeeper for my soccer team
F2
Nobody:  People at 3:01 : THAT SPEC IN BOTTOM LEFT OF THE CAMERA !!!
2 metres at its finest
Now where did u find 16 keepers
A 16 kepeers and a16 minute
Ronaldo needs to take note Messi . . . Nah hes already beat them
The goalies should've decided them and have 1 portion on left the other on right and the last in middle.🤦‍♂️
How are they standing
jezza lynch
Nobody : Literally no body :  Not even millions viewers :   Music tell us the future before F2 scores goal .😂😂😂
Damn..they're pretty good
Social distancing ?
Wwwwwwwwwwwwwwaaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwww
Who thinks the white guy makes funny sounds and voices
Can you do it?If there will Neuer, De Gea, Allison, Casillas.
okay so why are all the keepers all congregated in the same area of the goal. Mr lynch is taking shots halfway into the D. lmao why did i watch this!?
The goalkeepers did'nt Keep Social Distancing 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
🇸🇦🇸🇦🇸🇦🇸🇦🇸🇦🇸🇦🇸🇦🇸🇦🇸🇦🇸🇦

Beating 2 keepers is more impressive than 16 blokes made to stand centrally, in a line and in each others way. Poor video
Most used words great and save
Why are all the keepers standing only in the centre?!  I don't know football  that much.  Is there some rule that goalkeeper should not start standing from sides?
Yes
Why havent they all standard on the goal line
https://youtu.be/DaJqoMKAx38
Its fake
11:56 vamos JAJAJAJA
16 keepers 16 minute video
When you have practised crossbar challenge more than freekicks ;)
Hence proved, too many cooks spoil the broth. ;)
A video recommendation is that you should team up with unisport (another set of youtubers that do soccer videos) and have a soccer game  F2 vs unisport
Half the video was replays I swear
damn i was subscribed to this channel since it was at 990k or 2 mil
Double or nothing: if you want a rematch and to get bragging rights, clear 16 and double it. Otherwise, all credit to the keepers
The guy who is using left leg is very dangerous
Fake
What boots are you guys using
У живого футбола украли xD
Ok.... now I'm starting to think Billy's left foot is as wicked as leo messi's
They all are at wrong position.
Videos like this 🤩
Invite Neuer and try vs him 1v1, you can't pass him. He can block you in all ways.
OMG 😱😱😱
W sytuacji, gdy jest ich już kilku na bramce - no kilka ciamajd ustawiło się gęsiego i chcą bronić... Masakra. Jeden powinien stać przy jednym słupku, a drugi przy drugim, reszta mniej więcej w środku, a nie, że wszyscy się ustawili gęsiego, a ci walą po oknach, no to jak to obronić?
Billy carried jezza
It’s actually more enjoyable with really good goalkeepers
soy el unico que piensa que Billy Wingrove es muy parecido a David Beckham?
Wonder why they didn’t place like this:  I🙆🏼‍♂️🙆🏼‍♂️🙆🏼‍♂️🙆🏼‍♂️🙆🏼‍♂️🙆🏼‍♂️🙆🏼‍♂️🙆🏼‍♂️🙆🏼‍♂️🙆🏼‍♂️🙆🏼‍♂️🙆🏼‍♂️🙆🏼‍♂️🙆🏼‍♂️I
Next.... 30 goalkeeper
What a super
When they don’t pay them
This is how much KEEPERS BRASIL needs against DEUTSCHLAND in the world cup 2014
Superb bro. Iam seeing last 2 months your channel it useful for me
After 5 the keepers were not distributed among the goal and were missing all the balls
Go face 100 keepers 😂
What is the best football shoe in 2020

6:37 see just feel that ball strike in your face
yo what is up
The Keepers won't even trying
The more goal geeper the easier for them to score... because they have no space to dive and each keeper are depending on rest🤣😌
*3left 3 right 2 front 2 back that's is the way they catch the ball   easily*
not realistic, 2 goalkeeper are enough already...

Jeremy looks looks like dwarf from waist down, funny legs 🤣🤣🤣
Wtf are these suprise rules, if 5 keepers could position however they wanted you coudnt score 2 goals back to back never(no same time or 3 seconds delay shooting!)
Looks like COV 19 is non existent there 😂😂
The keeper goes easy for vids
Some shots are just impossible to save regardless of who the keeper is, you can have ter stegen in net but if you shoot the perfect shot he still won’t have a chance on saving it
THEY ARE LITERALLY STANDING IN ONE LINE
What.about.16.ALISSISONS😂😂😂😂😂impposible
THIS OWSOME
You should make a vid on the keepers individually to see who is the best like take 10 shots each against them all
This is a humiliation for goal keeper
There is no use even if there are 20 keepers standing in a straight line....😂
Those keepers have more saves than kepa
What we’ve noticed is when we tell them not to stand in the corners  we can still shoot in the corner and score.
F2: “If we miss 10 consecutive shots, we lose”  F2 later: *misses 30 consecutive on each level after 7 keepers but still advance because its for the video*
Surprise at the end they didn’t shoot when they were congratulating the goalies
Sub to Tomer Inbar
This challenge is rigged the goalies are in kindergarten doing a single file line
dude on the left is a genuine douche
Well if their "field of vision" is blocked maybe try standing side by side instead of one behind the other...
thats amazing
The Goalkeepers couldn't even save a word  document.
Good and learner video❤
The front goal keepers do almost nothing tho
i love your vids i play for a team in Texas called high plains drifters i would love to be in one of your vids
I have a feel they intentionally miss for the first and second goalkeepers
ya estan viejos :c
Whats going on with the slander of Lyncho?
all goals at right top corner. well paid 👍🏻
Why the keepers don't stand along the goal line instead all of them stand in the middle.  That is illogical
👍👍
If keepers can’t spread well it’s not so hard...
I cringe and my balls go inside out when he looks at the camera
What cleats are those
Its is the same if u have 6 keeper or 16 keeper....lame concept....
Thats to close distance
6:48 doesnt that look like Mahrez
Could henry or Denis bergkamp beat 16 keepers don't think so
Now, this vid featuring : Oblak, Ter Stegen, Alison, Ederson, Neuer, Navas, Lloris, Sommer, Burki, Mandanda, Lopes, Schmeichel, Sczezny, Buffon, and Onana
Don’t forget he’s better thanks Thierry Henry, Denis berkamp, and Robert pires
Jesus jezza since when does it go from 3 to 16
Do a challenge that Ronaldo scores against 10 keepers
How’s swaz
can we talk about how hard the ball sound
goal😎😎😎😎😎😎
Person throws the ball over the fence 😂😂😂 musta missed that clip
If they would have stayed on the line it would be impossible .
I honestly lost count after number one
Good strikes
ממש טובים
הם טובים
מגניבים
The way f2 creates videos are one of the most encouraging ways to make people take on new challenges... this is insanely good
so          they cloned karius 16 times
The keepers are meant to spread and cover the whole post Nice vid tho
Try 15 shooters, 15 goalkeepers, 15 balls.
Do a ball throwing machine vs 16 goalkeepers
The keeper standing in the centre be like= what should I do
Why are they all just stood in the middle
Loving this video, only half way through
The keepers aren’t professional standard
We all know three keepers placed properly can stop all those shots
I love your posts especially the paint ball one could you do that again /F2\ I have subscribed turned on notifications and liked
i'm a keeper to.  these keepers are amazing how did you choose them
U said good keepers or dumb ass kids??
buy me a football shoe for me .... pleaseee🥺🥺
Y didnt they just stand on the line
Found better keepers who play blind football
Honestly I was cheering for the young lads
14:53 me being annoyed there’s no where to shoot😂😂😂
If that was me I would give up 😂😂 if I couldn’t score
i love Boyle mor
a friend group is not a friend group without the two sporty 2.  like if you are in school now
The keeper on the left side of the goal was weak.
Totally fake
Billy much more skilled as he hits the majority of shots from a dead ball.
it’s still scripted tho, otherwise they would have stood infront of the corners, but clearly they’ve been asked to all stand in the middle and get in the way of eachother
that took some serious swaz tekkerz !
I got 32 goals in one seson
Love the social distancing
Can someone explain why people are hating on jezza? And saying swazz
I literally come here for Billy I don't think his YOUTUBE revenue should suffer because Jeremy is a vagina
Get big G in goal
They on work experience or something
Just imagine Roberto Carlos kicking, the damage that was going to be done.....
มีไทยแลนด์​มั้ย555
collab with keiran brown
Lynch is a lynch
Ground knuckleball tutorial pls
you guys scream too much
why they not all stood on the line hmm
surprised Jeremy didn't mention Spencers Social Blade Numbers at all xD
They are just standing in the middle of the goal
Poor number 1, had balls flying at him all day
Lmao your goal keepers are so good that they just watch it go straight in lmao. Tell them to actually make an effort next time 🤣
How many of the keepers do you think swaz was nice to off camera? I’ll take a guess at 0
Only 2 keeper on the line
Only 2 keeper on the line
6.15 the sound of the ball😘
16 Keepers and 16 Minutes video is long🤣🤣
Also swear they said 10 shots and they lose, they’ve done about 16 shots with 16 keepers
Could tell swazzy boy was getting pissed at every save
This is time wasting
Jezza means keemokazi (tik tok) right
Was it the cold that you needed long sleeves
https://youtu.be/T4oAFMJLeeo
yeah id like to see this with goalkeepers actually standing on the goal line and not in-front of each other like idiots.
Guys i'm from Brazil, i watch your videos all the time, i'm a big fan of you, hug, are let's go Brazil kkkkkk
Fukry ....,..because they in the middle only smh 😑😑😑🙄🙄🙄
More than 3 kinda just get in each other's way
Covid19: exists F2:lets put 16 guys together in a goal
Social distance
You should do a video we’re you have to dribble around 20 defenders one ☝️ keeper . First start with one keeper and 1 defender then 2 3 4 and so on and on to 20 good luck
Swaz
Bro make a video of scoring against 100 keepers
Congratulation guys.  You're selected for Chelsea next transfer out of 10 upcoming
What the sense while in straight formation
Wow this is nice
anyone know the song at 1:34?
You guys literally made all goalkeepers stand in the centre. Make them stand side by side and then see.
Today is my B-Day. Can I have some love?
Barca playees after watching this vid Barca: oh uefa please allow us 16 goalkeepees in next year's champions league Uefa:sure why not. Barca: yesss Uefa:if your manager can buy them. Barca:he does have a point
16 keepers 16 minute video
I think I’m the only one but I freakin hate when they roll the ball especially Jeremy
in my community if anybody scored in the goal with 16 goalkeepers thats stuff of legends right there we talking about that for years to come, campfires, chatgroups, heck we telling our grands kids this
https://youtu.be/JDfdImnjCrU
This is too easy for the best Player on the ball at arsenal
Man I just had to watch this with no volume. I mean, their voice is just so... annoying.
Your really good footballers
Chamar esses cara p jogar no meu time
Please remove the audio from replays
they failed challange 11 they got it in in shot11
WOAH BACK UP I TOOK A BREAK IN MY INTEREST FOR SOCCER FOR LIKE 3 MONTHS AND YALL HAVE 12 MIL SUBS?!?
Why they are all standing in the middle and disturbing each other, they should be standing all over the goal
I think you guy can do it
anyone know the song at 7:14?
Bet the keepers just get told to not try too hard and save to many 😂
The goalkeepers’ decision to stand almost in each other like ants, makes me a bit angry. There would be a lot easier strategies
Hello Arvin dude even Barcelona has humiliated Bayern so plz...
I love how they always praise the goalkeepers after a save
Lmao wtf did I just watch. We all know you wouldn’t have made it passed double digit goal keepers had they actually been standing in a more logical formation. Not blocking their eye visions 🤣 this was more funny than impressive lol
Billy sounds and talks like David Beckham
DAM  barca need maximum 20 keepers to win
More like brainless keepers?
Imagine being that 16 th goalie and just watching everyone have fun while waiting to get in
Jezza you got a new Lambo?
Toughest challenge because the keepers actually move
16 keepers that don’t move
Not need 16 goalkeeper only need manual nuar...and the goalpost is vanished to score goal
New album  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCquQtOjtgHxAYgwot64UuyA
Why don't yall play for top clubs if u that good
Make tutorial for knucklleball🙏🙏
The one with the long wasn’t good
No
I'm 13 and I'm better than the goalkeepers
Most of the time I heard great save lolol

azerbaycannnnnn qurban qurbanov

Ironically..... When the keepers are increasing goalscoring is kinda easy
129700.like😁
F2 *stick 16 keepers in goal* Social distancing: *Am I a joke to you?*

Why don't you guys play professional football?
Still no one can beat score hero keeper
OMG who came up with such idea anyway😂😂
What the heck are they doing  Just line up from left post to right post c'mon
Son buenísimos
Algunas palabras en español se ve que sabe
Dijo vamos
Y’all lost y’all shot it more than 10 Times
that’s not social distancing
2:56 ..I can't be the only one who had a reflex of kicking that ball that was approaching 😂😂😅
16 keepas for 16 minutes. Unlucky jez and bill
It would have been so easy if 16 of them were kepa
You guys should be in premiere league
Why they all are not  on the goal line ???
Hahaha Barca needed kiper like him
Next Video: Yes Guys! Santander the official bank of the Uefa Champions league have challenged us to score against 100 keepers!
Please Play 50 goal keeper Please
These many keepers =Neuer
not even these could stop lingard
I like how the goalkeepers looking how the ball going into the goal
1番前のキーパーが1番怖い
https://youtu.be/dGw2QFdAUgE
This normal football for mourino
You guys have great sportsmanship!  Great save!
Justice for stephen
Now F2Freestylers is getting into real business.
the keepers are not even good
7:01 did somebody fart??
At 5 goalkeepers, why was no one covering the left side?
that gk on the left stood still most of the time
Goalkeepers=16 Minute of video= 16
they all good keepers
When are they going to accept the fact that nobody actually likes Jeremy and Billy is the only reason the channel is still  alive
I'll not lie.these keepers lack cooperation
I love football
SJ got 3’ed up 😂😂
Gta players vs rockstar
Wankers
This was better!  I just don't get why there's so many hate comments here.
Fekir to the goal was a solid option 6:48
What's the name of song at 1:45 min in video . Please some one tell me please 😔
Barca would need more keepers VS Bayern
Wow I dont expect that fake content.
outfit details and football shoes pls
Did you hear he had a Lamborghini
Actually insane
This video is crazyyy!!!! I loved it
Billy ceo of !WHAT A SAVE!
So after this u 2 need to  pay all 16 keeper ya
Funny that you edit out about 300 shots to make it look like you score within 10 shots. Literally saw Billy start running to kick the ball and then the camera angle changed.
F2 please challenge modern goalkeeper  So we can know if he is a real keeper or a fraad Like guys so they see it
is it me or is billy looking more like david beckham back in the days
messi is retire
I think only one goal keeper the one with the white gloves was conceding most of the goals. I pity him
copiaram na cara dura do bzk
U guys are sick
One on one? how about 16 on one
After 3 keepers Lets just line up for drinks break
Your left leg is very powerful
They are better freekickerz than 99%of proś.

Sterling has left the chat...

you guys are legend
https://youtu.be/8NgswG7Tjpo
Wtf guys...spread on the goal line, don't just stand in each other's way....
Well it wasn’t really that hard if the keepers are in a straight line and not filling out all the gaps in the net
Vamos
Where did you find those keepers lol power scares em
I was only able to do 2
This is how many people watch  BfordLancer48 👇🏻
What did jezz do so much hate towards him in comment section
this is how un payed goal keepers play like
there all stood in a line WTF
imagine being the 16th keeper getting 2 minutes on the pitch
Its only me that see that the video has 16 minutes and the idea of the video is scoring with 16 GK in goal...?
Why are all the keepers staying one place That doesn’t make sense
5:24 They had the exact same animation.
Am I the only Fortnite YouTuber that watches the F2
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPTCPQOVF2anicpCvOBqRQA
Wowwwww
C'mon bruv . Maintain social distancing .lmao🤣
Hola
16 keepers vs ball launcher next?
I feel bad for the keepers on the front they aren’t doing anything they should’ve just gone on the corners to block every shot 😂
That was a good idea
Ouch!
f2 + gk vs u16 sunday league team
Lol all the goalkeepers could have easily stand on the goal line... But they were giving space
But they could play for rubbish clubs but there but actually good or best
Feel like cause the keepers can only stay one step from penalty spot it's pointless in there being more than 3  Just a bit of an ego booster
All the keepers should have been hanging on the post
Nobody wants to be keeper against these guys..top bins
The goalies bearly tried
Do this with 16 premier league keepers
Nally keepers😂😂
I 8-2 Inform you but Bayern would have still won
Yes
T H E Y   A R E   N O    H U M A N

Nobody  Literally nobody:   Billy: YeeSSsSeS

Can you do 20 keepers?
When they dribble towards the keepers it just reminds me of how Scottish teams play against rangers 😂
You are the worst jkkkkkkkkkk got em
Where were any of these keepers in ya latest video though...
Too many cooks spoil the broth
Awesome
Billy has a sweet left foot
One keeper is better than de gea
Your  goal keepers are still  sukish
i have the ball they're using
the reason y you guys scored that many goals really fast was because all the keepers were standing in the middle.
Call only 1 keeper like Manuel Neuer and invite him for challenge ✌
Do a riboner
You should have tried the trivela to get to the bottom left
this looks very hard
They should be pro
Just when ppl think they can do everything they do an even MORE IMPOSSIBLE challenge
Amazing interesting video 😊🥴
Imagine someone walking past and sees this
can you guys do some more card shootout challenges i love them ❤😍
Wonder if jezz is getting a new car at any time

Are those keepers NPC's
KICK JEZZA OFF F2
4:44 why were they all in the middle 🤷🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
Bill are you happy that liverpoool  won the league
disappointed there was no mention of his car in the title
Sterling watches this nervously.........watches his miss aagain
all the hands of the keepers just looks like the wave
Has anybody else realize that billy looks like eden hazard from far
This  is.  So hard
WOAH NO WAY YOURE GETTING A LAMBORGHINI?
If someone can tell me how to train in a small room during lockdown. I really love playing football but I dont have much space I play with what I get and where ever I can. Plz help me amd thanks

I wish u can come to India to find football
When I clicked the video, it’s already 1 0 0  0 0 0 so F2 do another one
Dudes what about korona?  What about social distancing?
sorry theres like 8 gk's why cant 2 of them just stay on a post each. its as if theres not enough people to cover the middle already.
u have to do a rematch
🔥 keepers are so hard to find how you get that many 🤣
Shouldn’t be a problem for the best on the ball player at Arsenal in the Invincibles season.
Great Video
Why you guy don't wanna play for arsenal or any other clubs after this,idk
Do another Messi vs Ronaldo part 3						Like if you agree
Whh aren't the f2 professional
Let’s see 15 keepers actually cover the goal
I came here just to write a comment and leave and I pray that Jerome see’s this. Mr Jerome Linch.. you are an absolute legendary man child, you wouldn’t even make it in today’s Arsenal and that is saying something. Nice Lambo though, I hope you’ve got enough in the pocket for when you’re in your 40’s and these football videos feature more ambulances and hip braces you old old man x lots of love Middle class guy
Sterling could never do this....
😎
15 goalkeepers except they aren’t allowed to actually stand where the ball is going
looks so easy
As if they didnt shoot when filming the outro, best decoy move
Do another but 20 but u have to score 2 all the way til 10 but not consequtive after 5
U R THE BEST I EVER SEED LOVE BOTH OF YOU⚽️⚽️❤️❤️
You've now got 100k likes, waiting for u to make the rematch!
the Internet is seeing Jezzas true knobead colours

I would like to see Billy and Jezza as goalkeepers 😂
Now YES! Karius is no longer a Prime Icon 😂
This channel is turning into dude perfect

Even funny how much theyve edited the vids to actualy score and just to let you kmow the keepers are told not to try at all to make the f2 look good but there not

Gks save everything and when they score once they beat em... wtf ??
i love this
Jez is the biggest wipe
Can u guys do part 3 of messi vs ronaldo pls
7:52 Billy’s battle cry
I think Bill has slightly a better touch on the ball so he’s a little bit better of a striker than Jen, but I think Jez is better with dribbling than Bill and Jez still has a great strike... maybe a better knuckle ball than Bill but overall Bill better shooter in my opinion but both guys are amazing a super dope
Jeremy ‘I’m a muppet’ Lynch

Grow up Jeremy you’re 32
My god f2 is world class footballers, like Messi or Ronaldo long shots, absolutely brilliant if they play in big leagues like the premier or la liga
I sold my newborn baby for an Audi R8. #babyswazz
What a bunch of wankers
WOOOOO
Good goalkeepers like the best on the ball at arsenal don't make me laugh
Aye Cambridge united lad in goal let’s go
“HES GETTING A NEW LAMBORGHINI”
Crush: do you like anyone? Me:yeah, you Crush: sorry i have a boyfriend Me:yeah, you?* Billy: 12:44
F2: 2040 playing against robo players
Its the best player Arsene wenger has seen
Fixing videos just for entertainment not real
Jezza your still a prick
Bro I am a little kid like 9 and I have done it with three keepers
Put some stones in place of those keepers🤣
Billy/Jezza, do more videos with Jabz. Too funny! Love them. @f2freestylers
Wow is the incredible
I'm sorry but this Chanel is such a con, 12 keeps all stood in a forward line just allowing space if they all stand on the lien and great 2 horizontal lines in front of each other the F2 won't score. But obviously the F2 have to score otherwise the keepers don't get paid. CON
Stephen would batter you
The goalkeepers are just diving
F2 would actually be good to watch if Lynch F’ed off
Jezza a battyboi
so much swazz in this vid    sorry i meant spazz
That Jeremy is so cheesy I played with him at arsenal when I was 14 he wasn’t good enough then
the f2 are twats
Do you have an Audi R8 mate?
Can you make a  giveaway for some balls
The Hungry Professor, if you know you know
i came here just to laugh at jeremy
15:04 that shot went in lol
why are they standing altogether that's a joke hahah
F2 told the first keeper he was doing good, just think of how honored he is
the guy with  green stripes on his jacket attempted everything as much as he can..
So cool
Yooh movie fans pass by.
OmG sOcIaL dIsTaNcInG
Stephen the 🐐
Could I try out to stop your shots ?
who do you think is better Jezza or billy ?

100 keepers ????????
Wow is that the ‘best on the ball player at arsenal’?

Barca could only win if Messi was upfront and rest all in defence
ILove f2
ikr

Jezza is a tosser #teamstephen
Billy should make his own channel, the other guy is boring af
Are you believing yourselves guys? They are all in the middle  If they spread out on the line  YOU WON'T SCORE.
he front GK how much the pay for u standing right there?? stupid
Nice social distancing lmao
smells like beta in here
Mr and mr vs 16 keeper🤯😳
Only here to leave a dislike. Stephen all the way
Joga muito 👏👏👏
That feeling when u shoot and the keeper still in the same spot but when u do it to 16 keepers 👌perfection
Billy is the player enough strong ❤️❤️👍best
F2 really think we are stupid  This videos is sketchy  The shots they are shooting are way to easy to save why are the keepers making seem as if thy are trying  If they want us to believe their videos aren't fake get proper keepers not amateurs who can barely react
Jez is a real life case study on why money doesn’t negate being a 5’4 cringe little cock
Surprised lynch didn’t mention his car before the video kicked off
Social distancing.
16 goalkeeper in 16 min
Were you the best ball player at arsenal
Jezza ‘SWAZ’ lynech
its funny how the video lasted 16 minutes
Jezza is a Tosser honestly everyone likes Stephen more
Bayen probably could beat lyon with like 4 gk`s
Do a no bounce challenge doing a rabona
The keepers needed a better strategy
They aren’t the tallest keepers
Jeremy “spazz” lynch at it again
Yes yah
Are yeah thats not me
I have now sold my house to be an audi R8 to achieve true swaz
Obvious they're going for the sides. These 16 "professionals" just gathering in the middle?!? should never be playing for their clubs ever again
Surprised your massive head can fit in your Audi Jez....... swaz that
Hi me barsil you cards in fifa 21?? #99
NOW THIS IS SWAZZZZZZZZZZZZ
Wetwipes
Great!!!

This is how many goalkeepers Barça  needs against Bayern
9:38 calm down
Can you guys do a messi vs cr7 plz like to try to see a new video of these amazing player
16 KIPPERS      16 MINUTES OF VIDEO
F2=ronaldo and messi and mpappe and neymar
Why not try ball launcher vs robo keeper
This is me and my friends when teacher discusses about something.......... Just stand there and do nothing
Scoring goals against a whole starting XI in net seems a bit dodgy to me🥴🥴
Please send me a crampon

Guys you’re the best Duo on YouTube but also the most humble and genuine people on the internet. F2 in da ❤️
9:07 when the year 11’s stole the year 7’s ball at school and they tried getting it back😂

Fifa keeper glitch in real life
Sign him,barca. Sign him
Aboné a adam yt please
https://youtu.be/UWuJpxbPqaM
I think the keepers face should be blured because they may struggle to find FC after this video
Keepers you that it's embarrassing for you
i want binod as keeper

Sterling left the chat

بدنا عربي
كفوو
Nice
16 ads about weetabix popping up as well 🤮
This is every strikers dream🤣🤣 to shoot as many balls as you want and you don't have to get it back
Actually 3 goalkeeper is way tooooooooooooo greater than 16....
Sterling cant even score an open goal...please challenge that coz tis is too easy!!!
The 1st Keeper is actually the best one out of all
Yeah a 16 minute video. Love that💯
If you think we're all idiots and would actually believe this script,  we are n_......  *looks at the views and likes*  - Okay we're idiots, now when's the next vid coming?
I could see a fungus spot or dirt at 2:46 which is extreme left of the screen. You need to clean your camera!
At the time were 5 keepers  I think they are que up in a beverages
I'm not questioning the skill of the keeper, but they don't seem very intelligent when they're standing in a line
They should have started frm 0 gks...
Keeper: *breaths*  F2: ohhh great save!
Please please do a messi vs ronaldo
I hope them goalkeeper succes in their Carrier
they should stay in the line 🤣🤣
f2 are the best. class guys well mannered. well done
me half way through realizing I HAVE THAT SAME SOCCER BALL!!!!!
Are F2 trying to get a contract at man city 😂
Come on now, 6 feet apart
This video should’ve been called how to get Covid-19
14 F2Gk = oblak + courtois
silly.... if all the goalies stood on the goal line, they'd never score... making them stand narrow and behind each other makes it easy
What boots are Billy using?
why don’t they just spread out on the line
Ochoa enters the chat
What is the point of this if they are just going to stand in the middle
Op
7 keepers skill not covering all sides ... but great shooting guys
The keepers are like a bunch of NPCs lol
All the keepers are David De Gea(s) LMAO
messi vs ronaldo vol 3
Qué se siente ser derrotados? (a huevo ) 🎊🎉😄🏆, eso sí, tuvieron que ser 16 porteros😀
Wow so happy they all did covid tests and came back negative to be so close to each other. CUTE
They just shooting bullets towards those front goalies 😂
Unreal stuff Swazz Tekkers, you’re my hero
Do the sledgehammer next time they won’t see it coming😉😂😂
F2 we want 20 keepers
Corona is about to end these men's careers
The first 2 shots 👀👀👀 come on f2 u better than that
I’m a goalkeeper too, I’m actually amazed on how good these keepers are 🤩 hopefully I’ll be as good as them ❤️
There was like 5 gk and they are all behind each other? Why don’t they just spread out ffs🤦🏼‍♂️
There won't be a second part because the UK just got 16 new cases of COVID-19
Are you guys brothers
Imagine all the amazing freekicks we'd enjoy if Billy was a pro
hey hey those keepers should be social distancing
What cleats were those
This is how many times they said ‘WHAT A SAVE!’                                                              👇
The goalkeepers could’ve been more far from each other then no goals will be conceded
Hai
🤯🤯
keeper in the red boots in the back is dirty
if each keeper covered one side its impossible to score with more then 5 or 10 keepers, this is dumb they all just stood in the middle and left the corners open smh
im not saying the f2 are not good but wtfff  this is so stupid, the all stand in the middle
Do 20 to 50keepers. Nice try F2 and awesome job keepers.
Best on the ball player at Arsenal during the invincibles showing his worth here 😂
Bill>Shooting but Jezza>Tekkers
I wanna see the F2 vs. Jan Oblak
Why they all stand in the middle
Next challenge : f2 tryna score against 3 ucl goalkeepers
If there was 2 keepers the shooters would be smart enough to shoot both of the balls where the keeper on the right side but if the other keeper in the middle he would have probably saved the shoot bois straight physics
is that rabona gk in 2 goalies
Good social distancing
The 10 goalies should have spread out in the goal
Just shows you have 16 S##T keepers 😂😂😂🙄
1 keeper 15 holograms
theres a reason why the game nees only one good keepers
Not sure why they all stood in a line 😆
6:48 is Ryad Marhez converting into goalkeeper ?
John from the pub just lost his job 😢
COVID 19🧐😳
Ναιιιιι=greek =yesssss
Rematch with twenty goalies but with two goalpost attached together
Is it just me or this looks super easy considering all the keepers were in the middle of the goal
There shooting rockets so close like what do they expect there not good f2 are garbage
Jez was the best on the ball player in the invincibles season and you can see that clearly here what a talent he would walk on to any club in Europe
Barcelona need 16 goalkeepers 😂
Who else is just thinking give me one of those keepers for our Sunday league team cos all of our keepers r full of shite
Finally they told the keepers to try
Bruh social distancing
Social distancing at its best
Cambridge United keepers??
F2>Messi+Ronaldo
What do you think about 16 good goalkeeprs (?)
10:07 the goalkeeper like a boss
100K Likes boys! We'll do this 👌
Corona doesn't exist...
Social distancing
Billy’s left peg is unreal !
Fajny filmik
Algún shileno?
Good chance of one of these 16 goalkeepers playing in the prem one day
Great to see social distancing isn’t being considered... 😂😂
Get the 100k likes I want to see this happen with 20 keepers
meanwhile sterling misses an open goal.
Wth it's summer. But great vid
Billy is the CEO of hitting the post
Русские тут?
3 keepers would be enough not to let them get in, if they spread across the line evenly. The middle keeper would step a little forward not to get on the side boys' way. Such a pointless challenge
billy shots be killing it with the accuracy ⚽️🎯💯
U can put 100 keepers in goal if make them line up this way it still counts one. U didn’t score for 16... it’s all made up bullshit. u probably wouldn’t be able to score against 3 or 4 keepers if they line up as a triangle and have 2 keepers at the post.
You have to take it quickly like taa
They should add this to fallguys
Love you guys
The way the goalkeepers arranged themselves was too biased....to keep f2's respect i guess🙄🙄🙄
Saveee great saveee 😂
When Billy screams the first thing that pops in my head is DON'T LEAVE ME DON'T LEAVE ME  DON'T LEAVE ME
“Toughest challenge yet” 🤣 said every challenge
The video is also 16 minutes 😲
TOTSSF Shoot Out PLS
*Social distancing has left the chat*
Its corona time
Y las mascarillas donde estam???
Whoever can get the ball pass 16 keepers to the back of the net is just a legendary player 🏆🥇⚽
F2 doing some bullshits nowadays No rematch needed mate
16 keepers, 16 minute video ;)
The best is 2 keepers but more than that is distraction
At 15:05 sure the ball goes in
SOCIAL DISTANCING ??????
Did anyone noticed that the goalkeepers were not covering whole goal they were standing line by line
This felt like an Adidas ad
Who is the goaly it's look like a girl
4:44 F2: Don't move ya'll. Keepers: Ok Done!
@Billy, you should have hit them with a sledge hammer
hi f2 i am in india in kurnool city can you reply
Big io
The 1st keeper that was on the goal sucks he dosent know how to dive all he does is rolls and does parkour when he dives man fck that maniac    Thx for atleast 1 like 😒😒😒
جزاءري دير جام
This would be better if they were 16 of the world's best professional goalkeepers
Imagine there being 16 of the best keepers in that goal
Fans: when we getting a real goalkeeper F2: okay let's shh the crowd and go from weak goalie to 16 club goalies and still score against 15 in the goals😂🔥 F2 fans: *quiet*😂
LİKEEEEE.................
Eles diviam ser jogador profissional
Who ever read s this have a good week
4:54 but why they all are standing on same position they can easily cover the post by standing side by side🤔🤔
I’m sorry but most of them were dead
https://youtu.be/wmZbMSJRsKw
Shakes from supa strikas wouldve knuckled the ball through all the keepers
I'm feeling bad for those 16 Paid guys !!
I'm actually waiting for a prank now
Is it just me or are the f2 shots are unbelievable everytime they shoot
Why aren't there any girls...
The music gets louder as they are going to put the goal
Barcelona shoulda used this against Bayern 😂
that is  the most EPIC" video every       like if agree  :)
Epic.
20/20
Man Utd need you both
When watching F2, I expect/count goals only when the beat drops. (Lifehack)😌
LAME

Howd you manage to find 16 garbage keepers these are you're average weekend league keepers what a joke
This like when you got too many Mii characters and they just stand about doing nothing .
Keepers at the front blocks the sight of the back ones
2 keepers were better that all of them
Why are they standing in a line
When you die the real you( the spirit inside your body) either goes to Heaven or hell. Going to either path depends on if you accepted or you rejected Jesus Christ as the savior.  Heaven is a very good place with no sins, sorrows, crying, lust, greed; in other words there is no sin there and it’s full of joy.  Hell is very terrible and it’s very very hot, you can’t survive placing your hand on a hot stove for 10 seconds, don’t even think you will withstand burning there without being consumed, The thing here is you will be burned without being consumed in hell the same same way you boil a hard rock in water you will be there for eternity, Again after judgement you will be thrown in lake of fire forever. Matthew 13:50 (UKJV) “And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.”   So how to get salvation and be on your way to heaven?  First thing first; Believing at Jesus Christ does not involve worship of other gods(church leader&ancestors), object(hand bands,car stickers,trees e.t.c) Muhammad,buddha e.t.c. It's only believing at Christ as the perfect sacrifice for your sins. It's your choice but know that rejecting Jesus Christ will send you the wrong direction.  No works can save you, there is no physical thing you can do to get saved but you are only saved through faith at what Jesus Christ did for you as simple as that.  Ephesians 2:8-9 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.  Believe and confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ was crucified and he shed his blood for your sins at the cross and was buried but risen again on the third day and alive in heaven now, that way you will receive salvation and be on your way to heaven during rapture or after death.  After believing at Jesus Christ as the savior you must change your ways and try to stay away from bad works or sins as hard as possible, you must show that you are a new individual in Christ. e.g stopping fornication, getting drunk, homosexual acts, masturbation, pornography e.t.c.  As a human you will still fall at some sins of course as no human is perfect, but you must not swim in sin you must try your best to fight against sins and live a righteous life.  Also grow in the word; I suggest the following YouTube channels; Real bible believers, Robert Breaker and Pastor J.D Farag..
God is coming soon repent from ur sins
Maybe next episode 16 defenders against one striker ⚡
This vid was amazing plz so a re-match
👍 nice dudes.. I know you can do it .... 👌
The are so good in shooting.☺
The ginger-haired kid tho...
Im the jawa
Just wanna say for all those saying the goalies don't move (in other vids) they actually do many takes until its perfect
Can't even score the penalty in reality 🥴
Imagine marcus rashford was in

Can you Provide me  nike Football shoe

Sir please I wanna be trained by you sir
The quality of keepers was 10/10 this time. Finally!
Im now in minute 5 and the keepers are not in the corners. Why dont the stand 4 next to eachother on thr goal line and 2 on front of it.
I mean ... you're lining them up in front of each other. Kinda lame. Technically it's like shooting over the yellow practice wall men. Still takes skill to go top bins. But the thumbnail should be how they line up. Cheeky bastards
If all those keepers stay in a line cover the whole gol there is no way you can score! When I sow the title I said there is no way that is true I should see this but then when I sow how the keepers were standing I got disappointed!!
What are the white boots you guys have called ?
I love you billy
you guys are really fabulous....... I don't know from where did you get this ideas
Where did they all come from
3:33 please anyone can tell me what type of tshirt that man is wearing  ??

F2: *Take a bad shot that the keeper easily saves* F2: “Great Save!”
Never clicked on a video this fast
SUBTITULOS PORFAVOR
God these poor kids, getting these wham shots over and over. Props to number 1 being there that whole time and the guy in red and black that saved that mad top corner shot
Covid-19: ‘exists’ 16 keepers staying 1cm away from each other
Billy: Call me Lionel Wingrove 😭😭😭🤣
Jez do you really have to roll the ball to kick, why dont you just be like billy having the ball be in place?
2-8... That's all i gotta say
The rules you made, made it easier for you!!!
Something tells me those goalie reactions are fake.
Everyone asking for  " X amount of subs with no videos "  I'm a tiny YouTuber with 300 subs just trying to make fun CONTENT
Its proper satisfying when they all look back at the exact same time
F2: We can score against 16 keepers Lingardinho: Pathetic
I hope this rematch doesn't take as  long as the predator one
Could they not all just stand on the line?
I guess it's more hard with 2 goalkeepers.
He should play with greenwood

This now deafeated my opinion of sticking everyone on are team in goal as a wall ☹️
I think F2 should go head to head in a 2v2 match against Messi and Suarez. Like FIFA 20s VOLTA football
Every single goalkeeper there is better than de gea
Kral 👑
Is the 8th goalkeeper Riyad Mahrez 🤷🏼‍♂️
Can you do that with 20 keepers?😂💯
Omg buen video brother
They’re all better than Kepa ffsss
Billy changed his boot.. Then changes the tally of goal scored.. 😎🤗👑
COVID has entered the chat
I wanna see them destroy @moderngoalkeeping
Hey you lot go a new track out! Please take a listen, it helps!
No one is covering the corners! All bunched in the middle! This is BS!
Like 👍If you want Messi to score a hat trick in next match. 1like👍=1 Joule of energy for messi to score a goal.
what is the goalkeeper doing .. spread out in the goal, and stand in two rows for heck. too easy🙄
Umm cough cough social distancing
Pretty scriptual
Cool boys
The really said coppy paste with the goal keepers
2 adult men getting excited about kicking a football and screaming
- How many keepers do you want?  - Yes.
We Shud have given all these keepers to Barça to play against Bayern
2 goalies: Doing good job splitting and covering both sides  7 goalies: Aight boys, make sure to line up straight for the fire drill
Billy is such a better finisher then Jezza is
Can you PLEASE continue the f2 prank wars? I’ve now watched every prank 3 times because I love them😂.
To be honest those keepers weren't using Their brain. They should be alert and prepared to jump on either side and the centre ones remain at the centre.
To the person who is reading this :  You are amazing stay blessed stay safe and have a wonderful day
https://youtu.be/TCSUKIhjevo
Yeet
Have them all lined up in the line and no goals would have gone in...

You guys are good footballers you guys are strikers
👍👍👍👍
*Literally 1% who are reading this, you may become successful in the future❤☺*
How stupid are these keepers, everyone is huddled in the middle instead of spacing out to cover as much of the goal as possible. #Amateurs
Love you ❤
MOuse
Just waiting for some idiot to come along and criticise the goalkeepers
6:30 🥵
Impossible
The way they understand each other is just unbelievable
Latinos?
Why are they all standing in the middle of the goal? If three were spread across the line you’re not scoring.
https://youtu.be/TCSUKIhjevo

There are better than Karius and Kepa
all these keepers are better than having both kepa and de gea in goal
Should’ve knuckle balled it against the 16 keepers
Try do the same with pl keepers
Change kiper position
F2 is the best
Barcelona seeing this be like : 👁👅👁
The first keeper who was in goal is my goalkeeping coach
Fist time seeing youse on my recommend in a long time
Can you make a ZLATAN IBRAHIMOVIĆ overhead goal challenge PLZ
Billy absolutely carrying this video! Most talent player arsenal have ever seen barely getting a highlight 😂
Wheres the corona virus? 😷
5 gks and all stood in the middle of the goal okay lol all stand on the line never score
Would have been a lot harder if the keepers spread out
I’ve a video for best an idea to score a goal in this situation .
Dang
If they spread out the keepers they wouldn't have scored even past 3
16 keepers 16 min
What happened to socially distancing
So they obviously said that they can't put one on the post then.
Hello beautiful person scrolling trough the comments
Billy carried this 🤣
Make the GKs stand in distance
taoh meul knea mneak mdong
I am a big fan of you bro
16goolkeppees=16minute
4:43 all five keepers stand right in front of each other 😐
How much f2 pay them for just being doll right there
Seeing one keeper flat footed while it flies top binns is good this is next, next, next level 👏💥🤫🤣🤣🤣🤣💪
I like how all the keepers couldn’t physically fit in the goal
16 keepers and they all stand in front of each other with no ne in the corners - yeah, this is great. Come on.
I mean where where this in Barca's match
"Shooting against 16 keepers" - Ah okay I guess they're kids from school teams or some bad clubs maybe.  Also F2: *Goes against academy goalkeepers*
That rasta boy so useless there😂
That how social distancing should be
Make a video with Phil jones!
They call this impossible... Hahah
Best YT Chanel ever
Nice Vid
Only if Barca had that much.
Why the goalkeepers are all in the middle just spread in the corner job done
https://youtu.be/Ap0BCt4Qus0
someone: How useless are you??😏 me: i m  like the keepers standing at front😴
Physical distancing dude
6:50 that guy looks like Mahrez.
*these ain't no keepers, they dont even jump fam*
Messi and Ronaldo when they retire they should join you guys and such challenges...would love to see them do this...
In order to score beautiful goals, you need to train! Well done boys
one of your keppers looks like an actor
7:49 thats the sound of a hyped llama
The goal keepers can't be goal keeper
6:48 Mahrez
Forgot covid doesnt exist on a pitch
Il
Filmed before lockdown?
Does anyone else think that billy looks like hazard when he's shooting?
why the heck dont people dislike this..
Keepers were really good f2 always listens to what people tell them so they improve love that
If barca players would have been like by f2 they would have won atleat scored
انا اتحدكم
The ones at the front are just hindrance to the real goal stopping keepers.
chelsea should really sign the first lad..
i mean the more keepers there are the less coordination there is, the ones at the back wouldnt even be able to react as quickly as they normally would be able to, and i mean, first guy, stop overexagerrating like honestly u hit the ball right in front of you and u roll and end up 3 metres away no need mate no need lol
They should of done 8 on l the line and 8 in front of them :3
One of the poor fellas conceded 15
16/2=😂
The f2 need to do more longer videos like this
Watching F2 work together to beat many goalkeepers make me want to see F2 vs Trent Alexander Arnold + Andrew Robertson. 2 vs 2 the best duo vs the best duo.
I think after Barca Bayern Ter stegen is free hahaha
I love it how there was 16 keepers and the video is 16 minutes long
Mi consigliate le Copa con i lacci e senza calzino? Copa20.1
Can you give Chelsea a goalkeeper ?
That's like 1 semi pro keeper because all of them are useless not going to lie
16 keepers : JOINED THE ROOM Social Distancing : LEFT THE ROOM
Barca should sign these  2 guyz for replacement of Messi🤑
I still don't know why they didn't go pro At this point they are better then a lot of other pro football players
Sign them gaffer sign them
Warum stehen die Keeper nicht einfach auf der Linie wie im Intro?? Das wär dann doch viel schwerer...
11:54 is loser keepers 😭
Can you make a video with 6ix9ni
Its  really crazy
16 kepers skills  goal challange
Fake keepers they aren’t smothering the ball when billy and jezza dribbles it in and uses their feet not hands
This is how many goalies nan city needed against Lyon 😂
They should've add karius
The most liked comment here in the comment section really pisses the Satan out of the ass of Barca fans
When do the F2 goal?  O when the bgm drop comes
why  didnt the keepers cover the corners they left the corners exposed  all the same it was exceptional.
Not gonna lie I was hoping to see a trivela goal
I feel sad for the 16th keeper!! He hardly got any play time!
16 keepers 16 mins video what a coincidence
Just thinking about the storage container! Billy's got bad memories lol
Vedio should have ended at 3 keepers..
Multiple keepers but standing behind each other... Whats the fuck8ng use
Very good F2
Might as well play without a goal at this point
All the people wondering about the position of the keepers either didn’t watch the video or don’t have ears.
Me end up knock out all keepers
Fifa glitch alert
Is that jeremey ? The tiktoker
Oh yeah that's right
Just why
Just check their positions in the goal😂😂Useless
To nije turnir o preckama
For god sakes, spread the keepers. Why are they standing in a straight line ?
You guys are getting crazy stuff every next video.
16 keepers =Neuer
To be honest just having one half decent GK in most of your videos would be a step up
For those saying the keepers should spread across the goal, that leaves no chances for Billy and Jazza to score so what’s the point of the whole thing ? Cmon mate use that thing in your skull
I don’t know when they score a goal why they celebrate cuz another one just going to come in
On 5 keepers they all stood their looking like their a beech one direction
Tbh  Ter Stegen was just fyn the problem was at the defence It wasn't the keeper But anyways hardluck Barca  Next time
Left you you’re awesome
Omg 😱 16 keepers !!!!
Next cortois and oblak
Next can you try freekicks and penalties against a pro keeper
Put two goals next to each other to make it harder for the keepers
Barcelona need this much defenders too😂😂
Its fantastic  but why the goalkeepers didn't spread they were all in the middle if they were you wouldn't even score a single goal
Όλοι οι Έλληνες κάντε λαικ σε αυτό το κομεντ για να λένε οι Αμερικάνοι ότι είπα κάτι σημαντικό⬇️⬇️

barca need 100 keepers
Can you make a billy n jezza top ten goals?
16 Sunday league keepers is probably 1 Neuer
Wingrove was the on fire
I need a goal keeper for my under 15s here in Melbourne Australia.
Jez is a melt, Billy’s alright tho...
If only Barca had sixteen keepers...
If only barca used these many
Quality content
This was crazy and fun to watch
I wonder could they score if all keepers stand on a horizontal line in front of the goal
who came from ksi's public video for some reason cough cough
Why every goalkeeper is standing in the middle if the would spread all over the goal you wouldn't even have a chance to score against 10
SCRIPTED OP GUYS
No words to describe their work.....its just soo great
The Element
Hey what about social distancing
Hi
Why keepers are standing one behind other instead of spread in both poles
How many of u think that f2 should play in popular teams?
Why  cant they spread out FFS
😂16 keepers 16 mins long
Is this pro club?
nice try and good luck
I think they told the keepers to leave some of their shots coz it seems impossible against 16 keepers
Imagine putting the keepers in 2 lines in the middle to free up the corners.......
For 16 goalkeepers 16 minute video
Any indians watching this....full support.....😎😎💪
Can they please show how and where to shoot the football
He said toughest challenge yet like 50 times 😂😂😂😂but mind blowing technique thoo🔥🔥
why are the keepers in the center lmao
They were all in the center🤣... they could soread and its impossible to score unless they missed or something
May they be friends forever
Malayalam
This is goalkeeper needed to barca against bayern
Solution - stand 16 keepers in a queue.
Stopped watching after only 4 keepers, wtf is the point of this when the keepers stand next to each other?
safe distancing is not respected on a football pitch
V20keepers 👇
Can you do same with 50 keepers
Social distancing
bro they didnt even covered the whole goal
Sixteen archers
Why are they all in the middle lol
they say its so tough but they make it look so easyyy
Indo ada kah?
Wow that really is Impossible
F2 you guys can do anything
If the keepers have 3 or 4 in the back row, all you need to do is make sure they can see where it’s going early on. Most at the front wont react fast enough to get a top bins shot so it’s down to the back row to get to the top bins, and they need to see it early.

Y haven't u guys joined a team
like si no entiendes los comentarios
O my god 😧
Crazy
Swaz lynched is a tos
6:49:  Riyad Mahrez, is that you?
I like how to try and make their point that the keeper was good, they kept conplimenting them throught the vid. 😂😂
Why don't they just stand side by side and hold their hand up? No one will ever score a goal against that
Dude my team struggles to find a single keeper
I like how 1 keeper wouldnt have stopped me.
Chelsea should scout one of these guys
What psi do they pump their footballs to?
Wow. A football video where the keeper actually does something
You are right
surely they edit out the misssed shots, they hit the target every time
Jes We will improve the goal keepers  Goal keepers stay in the middle of the goad
When is the predator coming back
I wish they just lined up all along the goal and jumped when Billy and Jezza shot.    That was like my childhood dream to defend
I like when the keepers arent paid stand in goal and let the balls in
Barca wouldve needed 30 keepers to not get scored on vs Bayern
5:40 WAOWWW
2:57 who else felt the urge to just tap the ball back to billy and jez
RIP positioning.
Social distancing
They are like the WAVES 🌊😂
Time of video: 16 minutes And there are 16 keepers   COINCIDENCE??
These guys can score against 15 goalkeepers from 14 yards while Sterling can’t score against 0 goalkeepers from 2 yards... 😂
Thats how many goalkeepers Norwich needed Last season to keep a Clean Sheet
If u wonder how will Messi and Ronaldo play together: THIS IS HOW.🔥
Social Distances!!!
Social distancing
Social distances not a thing🤣🤣🤦‍♂️
Social distanceing has left the chat
8:02 the head movement is satisfying
some of these guys need pro contracts
Nice work
So true 😂😂😂
U all guys r to great.  Can u please show us how u  maintain yur body your workouts, diet as an video, please 😍😍
Barca should put this into consideration🧐
Nothing like 5 keepers looking at the ball
Kepa take tips
where is the social distancing
Prick
F2 played well       With Terms and conditions,lmao😂
This is  'impossible'
Wow yo guys are good
Y’all think your smart lol let me guess they couldn’t score when the goalkeepers are spread out so they told the keepers to stand in the middle behind each other lmaoo the left and right side are wide open
You just can’t beat the f2 you just can’t
Billy always breaking d hardest part❤️ but...
Barcaldine could of used these goalkeepers
If the keeps were going as hard as they could I think they would have got 5
What happen to  social  distancing
@6:47 F2 so rich they got Mahrez to keep for them
Tell me why that guy looks like Frenkie De Jong 6:06
Billy's shooting ability is too hot to handle.
Yo buscando un comentario en español
Pro clubs be like
They should have done a trent alexander corner kick shot
This looked like fun for both sides
I fell like Oblak can save better then all 16 keepers
One of the coolest videos from you guys I have ever seen more of this
F2 should make a vid with tekkers kid
great !
Hello! Im from VIETNAM
I feel bad for the keepers just standing there in the middle😂
Billy’s finishing is something else 💥
little did we know the players got sold after the manager watching this video
Coronavirus?
Modernday GK is the type of guy to do this but have 16 people take shots at him 🤣
The last keeper waiting like 👁 👄 👁
Good try 💪🏼💯
Ye Man True..😂😂
don’t get me wrong I love the F2 content but why wasn’t there any female keepers? There’s some out their just as good as male keepers!!!! Would be good to see some more female ballers on the channel ❤️
How many people can let Manchester city out of URL?                                                           Only one: sterling
If the keepers stand side by side.. f2 will struggle mahn.. good stategy to make them not save..
Was still easy for you two. Why are the keepers all in the middle, part 2 spread them out a bit. Would like to see this
U guys got talent  Do u ever think of being a professional player???
that's how managers want to test their players
Sterling today against Lyon missing an open goal. The F2 scoring against 15 goalkeepers.
Whe need these keepers in Barcelona
The keepers get paid to not save it sometimes 🤣🤣
Fifa 21 should have f2  ratings
If they were actually adult keepers this would be a different story... 🤣🤣🤣
Can’t help but hate Jeremy
One of these keepers can easily be in the Chelsea first team squad!
4:40 Why the hell are all the keepers standing that close? Open and cover more space in the goal. FFS
Make legends card shoot video please
شكله انا العربي الوحيد اللي اتابعهم):
That left footed guy should play professional football. His left foot is deadly
Do a challenge where you bring all the keepers from this video back you take ten shots between you and whoever conceded the least amount of goals wins something
Yeah F2 I have watched your vids for years u guys are pros bit freestylers
16!!! Cor blimey thats not easy
Social distancing?
Man City needed this kind of finishers to win against Lyon
At 7:49 they all did the same movement at the same time lol
Great video how old are the goalkeepers
The keepers should have just made a wall with some laying on top.
I have the same boots as Billy
It’s the difference between having the worlds best player and having a great team, it’s why Messi has never won a World Cup
Imagine being the 16th goalkeeper😂😂😂
The fact it takes 16 keepers shows that the keepers they choose aren’t good enough
This is how many keepers Leipzig will need against bayern
Bello essere l'unico italiano dai
The keeper with dreds was an extra 😂 that was no keeper
Every single one of them poor chaps got rona now
Biggest fan🔥just wanna thank you guys for everything
I did 10 MUScle ups in  a row, watch if you want!
Atleast now you guyz started considering the keepers👌👌👌.  Before all was just dummy.
This is how many keepers barca needed vs bayren yesterday
Ayo I’m a depressed fat kid, train me please. Honestly ain’t got nothing left anyways.
Why does jez always roll the ball before shooting
Love the vid so cool well done to the both of your for trying ng
i bet you the 10th- 16th keepers thought they would never make it to the post
No one,  Literally no one Billy:call me lionel wingrove😂
That number 5 keeper shot was bare sus why the all standing in the same place?
If they were to make another favorite 10 goals episode, the list will change
Legendary video boys 🙌
No social distancing tut tut tut
I think Billy’s shooting is better
F2 can do this challenge they can do anything
This falls under the category of the most impossible challenges in the world and it was made possible by the F2  Keep it up lads🥳🥳🥳
They forgot to mention the rule about the keepers being as centered as possible, but its alright i guess
This proves that the F2 are insane!
LFC
F2 has genuinely got me through lockdown 😂
1 like means +a kepper how many gk neesd barca to win a match?? 👇
Yea go bayern
Holy
If you think about it, when they tried scoring against Courtois, he performed way better than these 16 keepers. And Courtois isn’t the best goal keeper around. Imagine if they went again Oblak or Ter Stegen.   Impossible...
You guys should do 16 shooters 16 goalies
Imagine 16 Allison's 😌
Who's here after Lyon thrashed city 3-1?
SOCIAL DISTANCING WHERE?
Glad to see you've acknowledged how 💩 your gks are usually
F2 : scoring against 16 keepers Me: did u know the video is also 16 min 😏
More keepers=More confusion, but dont get happy, it still aint gonna be easy to score😅
اذا ما تبيني اقول اسم امك لايك
All english goalkeeper or real one?
*M I YUSUF - HEAD UP* *OUT NOW!!*  https://youtu.be/4wpzPHkUhfA
F2: this is impossible.                                            Also F2: scores loads of goals
F2 fans power in like❤️❤️❤️❤️
F2 fans power in like❤️❤️❤️❤️
this is the number of the goalkeepers in the street match😁😁😁😁
Looks to me like the keepers aren’t exactly social distanced like there supposed to be
Unlucky
How about a sledge hammer or a swaz
Nice
150.000 likes deserved
Yeah that’s true
16 keepers video ironically 16 minutes long
What are you guys made of seriously 😂✊🏽💪🏼🐐🐐🙌🏼🔥🔥🔥⚽️⚽️
https://youtu.be/os5RxLP0J5E
13:25 Me trying to explain my bad grades to my mom
Pes commentator:the shot was tough even two keepers wouldn’t save that
Replay
The keepers never occupied the maximum width of the blue restriction zone. If they did, F2 would not have scored a single goal. This looks like a setup and the quality of F2's shooting ability. Is questionable.
https://youtu.be/fEEZ3pofDjI
7:51 Billy’s scream is hilarious love it🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I recon a bit of knuckle could go far in this challenge 👌 that would be my strategy
نزلو مقطع مهارات كرة قدم😁😅🤣😂
Billy low-key carried jezza in this video
12:35 oh what a safe😂
Everytime the keeper saves   Billy and Jez: ah beautiful wat a save
Those keepers are shity
Wait.. F2 and decent keepers? No way
Plenty of social distancing going on here 😂😂😂
You guys should do a FIFA game Billy vs Jezza in jez's cinema room It would be class
The F2Freestylers are acc crazy cold
Social distancing
مى فيه واحد عربي
Hi I am a big fan pls  I hope u will reply
If Barca just had 16 keepers...
I'd love to do this but I've got severe knee injury
1:53 Jez be acting like Messi and Suarez
lets see f2 academy players vs f2 in goal!!!
9:12 how many diffenders barcalona  needed  to beat  bayern
I was wondering how they can possibly pull this off, then I realized the goalies were just uselessly stacking in front of each other instead of spreading in goal
F2 just ignore every corona rule. 16 keepers ALL from different households standing next to each other. I unsubscribed
this is how many goalkeepers  brazil nedded in the world cup :{-
Why do some of them look like brothers or relatives from the same family
At last a good goal keeper in f2 😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 lol
?
Impossible 1000
15.05 bill actually scored against 16 keepers just wasnt a great goal
This is how many keepers man united need to win the premier league
barca needed that kepper
I think the reason they scored at higher quantity is because all the goalkeepers became dependent on the others, like in high numbers they expected others to get it, that’s why they looked like mannequins on some goals. Also they didn’t divide evenly, they were all near the  middle.
Billy and jezza is on fire............ 🔥🔥🔥
F2 "well done lads" Meanwhile girl walks past
I love the astrsulian accent
YOU GUYS NEED TO JOIN PREMIER LEAGUE TEAMS YOU GUYS ARE SO GOOD
ბარემ მეც ჩავდგები😂😂
The first keeper was amazing .... would like to see more of him
5 STAR RATED WELL DONE F2
7:48 billy I love your scream and well done to the keepers and jez and billy
that is a lot of keepers try 30
Good keepers
6:50 - seems like Mahrez
I would definitely not score with all them keepers lol
Why dont they all just stand in goal instead of all over the place. The keepers suck donkey
F2 legends
Who wants second part 👇👇
Did anyone else think that Billy was saving the Sledgehammer for 16
Sometimes I don't believe in their shorts its too wow
Need that De Bruyne free kick drop!
This is how much goalkeepers barca needed in the bayern   Munich match
Sv2 and savva should do this

You missed "Yes, guys" at the begining  :D
The first keeper is the best
I love Juventus,,fans Juventus like
Alternate title   Bayern vs 16 barca keepers
why all of them r standing in middle of goal
No social distance😂
The 16th goalie must have felt so useless
Why did they not all line up on the goaline
Billy’s shot is so powerful
billy next time try a sledgehammer
I'm moslam 😉
Nice social distancing 😂
ya Barcelona really needs that
song at 8:03!!!??? PLEASE!!?? thanks <3
Do they mean that they need 16 keepers to stop them
1:51 ohhh the confidence from jezza
What team do those keepers play for?
I think they wanted the video to ne 16:16 min. long 😅
Oi oi social distancing boys
How many dislikes can I get in 24 hrs
Esti tare
Your the best football channel I can think of you deserve every bit of support you get keep up the good work
Me:😐 Me when the beat starts to get louder and build up:😯
Y a des français ?
Well played to everyone Good shots billy and jez
meanwhile barca decides to use this idea LOL
That is what I was  going to say
Jose Mourinho: right this down
Billy's shots are like bullets👊
Ur gonna get a lot of hate 4 this vid cus corona virus
No social distancing with them keepers 😂
I actually feel sorry for the 16th keeper  "You're gonna be in an f2 video!"  "You're gonna get 1 minute and 20 seconds of screentime"
Why are they pinned in the mid, make them wider to save the top bins shots, great vid tho
Very socially distanced
Bro Barcelona need to sign one of these goalkeepers 😂😂 they would have win Bayern yesterday
Hands down one of your best videos ever
F2: claim to be the best at shooting...               also F2: we can add decoys so it’s basically impossible for us to miss
My tryouts are Monday for high school wish me luck guys 😁
next one we want 16 strikers vs ksi in goal that would be funny as hell
Imagine Barcelona having this much keepers against Bayern Munich and still losing
Rly wish these guys werent so cringy. They’re so good but so cringy to listen to
Jez saying that they had professional keepers for this video made me soo satisfied
F2 brings in keepers that actually saves shots   “Everyone liked that”
What a video must if been hard 💯 love you guys❤️❗
Nice challenge. We have challenges, too. Watch my channel for challenges
If all the goalkeepers just lined up on the goal line, it would have been so much harder for billy and jezza
Remember that video you guys did with KDB. Try doing his technique he used on free-kicks.
F2 taking advantage of the bystander effect
Nobody: Not even a single soul: *F2: SHOOTING AGAINST 16 KEEPERS*
Social Distances is important guys, stay at home an be safe. *Hires 16 goalkeepers on next month videos*
FIFA 20 FUN
You guys were on the news in my country today! Congrats lads!
Hahaha yes
Nice
What position do ye guys play
Next video is ronaldo vs 16 keeppers against pls
Have to say by far one of my favorites
16 keepers in 16 minutes
This would be a great vid with man like haks the f3 😂
Ngl This is dum  It's like that over confident cr7 fan boy who always wants to take all the free kicks      Obviously not hating;) I'm saying this cuz the keepers dont look happy
Why can’t jeeez hit a dead ball lmao
This is BS. If the Keepers lined up, these 2 frauds wouldn't score any! What a sham!
6:52 THE KEEPER MAHREZ EXISTS!!
Exactly ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Why are they standing in the middle? Made the challenge easier if u ask me
Social distancing do me mad rn
4:47 from here I know that the keepers were just acting
Why they all standing  in the center?
This Is How Much Keepers It Needs To Stop Ronaldo From Scoring In The Champions League

why would the song say ‘im a lunatic’ directly when jezza scores
Nyzz❤️
Next challenge.: F2 against 2 pro keepers
I feel like if I was a keeper for these guys I don’t know if I’d be embarrassed or awkward
If only Barca had this many goalkeepers on the pitch
Social distancing - None
Y don't F2 play 4 a team
Ya true fact
Basically you’ve just got to reverse everything..
I think you guys should make a second channel with mostly pranks and all that
Binod
F2:Today we are going to do a 16 goalkeeper challenge. Doctor to the Goalkeepers:Make sure you maintain Social Distancing
Best challenge ever!!!
F2 are the best in the world
That looks easy asf
Should bring the predator as the last keeper💀💀
Billy is much better than jezz
16 keepers and all standing in the middle!
Like my comment please 🥺
I love how supportive they are of each and every one of the goalkeepers who took part
The keeper in green was toooooo sick 🔥🔥🔥
Social distancing 😂😂
Lol why did they all just huddle in the middle. Like spread out
NEXT VIDEO HOW TO PLAY FOOTBALL AT HOME
Even 100 goalkeepers can’t stop you
Me: Maybe I’m gonna be first My internet: NO!

Lionel wingrove
Patean desde el borde del área, cual es la dificultad, si fuera desde más distancia, eso sería algo impresionante,  pero así como lo hacen,  cualquiera
Please  hire one goalkeeper  for barca.....
me: can't score against one keeper  f2: 16 keepers destroyed
Think of the players standing in front doing nothing other than seeing the ball
Wow F2 you guys always surprise me.but am not sure it is your videos or moves that surprises me.
The eight goalie kinda looks like Kyle Walker tbh
2 hous 23k 😮😮
23 keepers
12:33 what a save🤙🤙🤙
Bill's voice was hilarious in replays
IT'S COMPETITIVE IN FOOTBALL
Messi wife: wake up its 9.                        Messi: they scored another one 😳
I wanna see it again for the fun of watching you guys
F2: So today we made sure strictly good goalkeepers  F2 GK: Am I a joke to you?
Cant wait for the rematch
Barcalona has 16 keepers in their next starting line up
I think the ginger kid was the best keeper he was saving a lot of the shots.
This is how many GK Barca and Chelsea need to replace Kepa and Ter-Stegen😂. Bayern score too much az dey would say!
BRO 16?
Those who are sad for barca please like the comments
Superb guys
Hi
F2 made this video after Bayern Scored 8goals against Barca.
I am waiting for another video
And also you are the best a
Some one should have done a trent
Pls tell where are you from             I am from India
No one: F2 goalies: we won’t spread out so that F2 can score and we get paid.
I am sure you can do it because you are the f2
6:48 Mahrez plays GK??
I love you
well after 3-5 keepers, the difficulty is probably the same to score. They just do not have a clear sight.
Tell shaune hi
Soo nice to see one girl between 16 boys
"Call me Lionel Wingrove"
F2 vs Sheffield United
Amazing can't believe
Why are they not spread out??
Not hard to do when the right and left side is just open like facing one keeper really
30 keepers
Why couldn’t the goalies make a wall that covered the whole goal
My new legends
nice social distancing 🌝
Realistically, this is basically playing against whatever teams Mourinho manages
Who else counted the keepers?
They do a mediocre shot and say great save to make it seem decent 😂
How is it that cold that you would wear a thermo legging
It's is a very difficult changelle 😵 But your the F2 u always finish changelles without losing them💪🔥🔥
Who else thought all the goalkeepers were going to be in the post at once
Nice
6:49 Mahrez and fekir combined
Lol bayern would've still scored yesterday against barça even if barça had 16 keepers😂😂
The keeper should be scatter...  Why all are in middle ? If they had scattered it would easy to save isnt it?
the keepers in the middle are just steady chillin
Billy is your hip injury ok
LEWANDOSKII- it was a pretty easy training session against barça..VIDAL- what! Was it a training session for you?
16 keepers 16 minute video nice
Lol
OMG
Nobody: Literally nobody: F2:it's a tough challage
What's your favourite sex position?
I wish Barca had these many goalkeepers against Bayern
Great video👍😜

Amazing video
Well I am not able beat single goalkeeper  F2:🤐🤐

Give you a best wishes
Well p
We’ve all loved this series🔥⚽️⚽️
next vid: 16 ucl gk vs billy and jezza  also the keepers: 12:03
6:08 when a keeper knows they should've covered the near post
After Barcelona lost nt good
Been a while since you put a long video
Even with 16 keepers Barca wouldve still gotten trashed by Bayern
Please make a vedio for 50 keepers
Why are the keepers congested in the middle?? Seems stupid
Next they should do 16 keepers with pk's 😂
It would help if they weren’t all stood in the centre
😍😎
You are amazing  I love your videos
Where is social distancing
Smash like ⚽🎯
Keepar 8 = Riyad Mahrez
10:07 that was really smooth 😂
Playing against 16 keepers and the video is 16 minutes 🤔
Why didn't they just spread out on the line of the goal? Stupid challenge if you don't do it properly..
Fun fact: you’re not in full screen
Great save . Great goal .in 1min
The keeper in black is very good    😂😂😂
F2 script : First 2 shots gonna be saves Next two shots goals
Iam your big fan from 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
I like Jezzas tiktok the best
6:50 Mahrez walking in like a boss
Did anyone notice that jazz almost always gives the ball a touch before kicking it.
I can never finish a full video because the music is so shiite. I’m not tryin to hear some aggressive shitty dubstep when I’m watchin footie skills
Karius would have been good.....               If there were these many
This is how kany keeper barca needed against bayern
This is cheating. Why are they both shooting simultaneously. And the keepers are novice. All of this is planned..
Next time 25 keepers
Barcelona need f2
If the keepers are placed in a line only deflections could beat them Love the f2
they are all KARIUS AND ADRIAN!!
This is what Barca needed
1:13 the ball changes in a few, how many attempts did you need to score against a goalie?
The keeper staying in middle is just watching
Fifa 20 fut champs script be like, not today boy.
Good thing is that this kinda also teaches the keepers to never lose focus
Where is the Corona At
AJユナイデットが尊敬してるYouTuber
Just see the Accuracy of Ball on the Pole of Billy
Most times when the beat is about to drop You know they score it
BILLY can Do Cross Bar Challenge Very Smoothly
It’s all good skill and shots but where was it against Ware U18s who had one keeper
BILLY Which part of the leg do you hit?
The definition of “no keepers saving that”
I'm sorry Bill and Jez but as I'm a goalkeeper myself, I was on the keepers' side for this so I'm glad they beat you 😂😂 #Goalkeepersunionforever
The ones called Alex and Louis were pretty bad
Juventus still has more lost finals
Any social distancing between these keepers????
What happened to Corona Virus???
Lionel wingrove Has a good ring to it
Barca could’ve used them yesterday, absolute shambles😭
This is how many defenders barcelona needed yesterday to stop bayern attacks.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤love u from iran
0:00 if you look closely you can see that the video is starting
Quique setien: how many keepers can we put on next match?
Who else skipped to like 10 mins to see how they were doing
Even 16 keepers wouldn't have been enough for barca yesterday 😎🤣
This is one of my favorite videos you guys have ever done! Thanks!
12:28 great shot jezza
Billy is really smashing goals

Jezza: how many goals have Bayern scored vs Barcelona?  Bill: 8  Jezza: alright lets duplicate it and that number would be the keepers of the next video   Bill: 🤯
Simply amazing...
Hay nhỉ
Billy's voice was really irritating today.
If Jezza and billy were in Barcelona than they would win yesterday match(Barca vs Bayern Munich)
And then there is me who cant score even if there is no goalie
Did you see barca vs Bayern Munich 8-2
Me: Imagine if someone scored against a goal full of goalkeepers The F2:Hold that thought
Can anyone dislike this vedio

You put 300 gks they are still gonaa score  Then what's the point of shooting a video
Pro clubs looks alot different
Please Subtitel Indonesia
Shoes name please!!
This is how many goal keepers barca needed against Bayern yesterday
only 1 hour and 146k watchers
Billy: call me lionel wingrove *because he did a fake shot and scored even tho Suarez scored that yesterday*
Who are your favorite players modern day
Very good op video
F2 were a bit rusty with shooting some down middle normally top bins
14:08 is what you’re here for

Cooooooool
This is literally playing football in 4th grade school
100 kepers
You should of just got jack Jutland
Great one :D
Can you do this please do it next week
Big fan of u two 🙂

Wow that's quite a lot of Goalkeeper's
Barca need these keepers😭😭🤣
I am a great fan
Billy:Call me Lionel Wingrove Meanwhile Messi:We lost to Bayern yesterday cuz Billy took my name😭😭😢😢😫😫😫😖😖
Cool brother I love your videos
Great shot by F2 pros
Very nice content
Oe castaño
Jansnfnaa
The 3 keepers at the back deserve a trail at a premier league club
Hey f2 how can i join the academy  i want to play football at my best
So I literally just watched 16 minutes of grown men complimenting themselves
https://youtu.be/nYLWLU6MJrw
Do you have 100 balls to score against sixteen goalies
There is no such word "impossible"
Thats probably  staged
pls make me a footballer
If only the US could get corona under control
YES BRO NICELY DONE PROUD OF YOU
Nice
PERFECT GUYS
Who is that ginger gk been in since 2 keeps he is actually unreal
Barcelona need this many defence cause tier Stegen fine it defence lol I'm a mens fan but he need to know how it felt lol
Yeah
How many are here for the thumbnail😉
Gg
10 pro keepers vs f2
Any manchester united fans here !!!👍👍
YA'LL ARE TOP PRO,S
It’s like playing against atletico
Billy=call me lionel wingbrove. Me=Barca lost 8-2 to bayern
yg kidal gila sih👍🏽
Me: "After reading the title" OOH THIS IS GONNA BE INTENSE!
Credits to these keepers, they're really good, like really really good
They worse more than tier shtegan
Kollam poli saanam
I'd die to see F2 collab with TgF
Frank lampard scouting leap's replacement
They invite 16 keepers to fight to corona virus
last line cant see anything !!!
Next pele-f2freestylers  Ant near them-Me
Dout ron that much, 4 steps max on the shot, dig left dig right dig left , shot with right, ar 3rd Step it thats 😩
Nice work you where so close
😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
U should do a video with woody and klieny it will be funny and they are former freestylers so they can do the tricks🔥🔥🤘🏼
Imagine F2 vs Oblak, Neuer, Ter Stegen, Alisson, Ederson, De Gea, Navas, Szczesny, Kepa, Courtois, Handanovic, Onana, Donarumma, Pickford, Patricio, and Leno. 16 KEEPERS
16minute video, 16keepers
Linagard could do this easily
3 goalkeepers are enough 2 in corners 1 in centre😁😁😁
How how how how how how how how
Extremely socially distant
On the first goal the keeper didn't extend his arms for the ball, probably would have been a goal either way. But the second goal... The ball goes under the crossbar AND HE GOES DOWN ON ONE KNEE????? hello men??? wat doink
Who are the the keepers names?
Where’s the social distancing in this then
should’ve put ter stegen it would’ve been easier
I love you from the 200k
Banger of a video🔥🔥🔥
30 keepers
Billy vs jezza videos are more fun... The same video, if you could do Billy vs jeez would bee much better. This is already awesome, loved it
Sad for Barcelona 😭💔
They could fr join a club but don’t?
I hope Barcelona signs everyone.  Ter stegen will be unbeatable 😂
I thought that the goalkeepers were gonna be like Chrismd goalkeepers.
Jesse Lingard: “5 keepers too easy.”   F2: “Hold up their Jesse”
8 2 say it but the keepers weren't particularly social distancing
what the f is this. Why cant they have the keepers on the line?
Type of content I’ve missed from the F2
Imagine this comment getting pinned
Why are left foot strikes so much more appealing than right foot??
Why were they standing like that
That keeper with the long hair was actually pissing me off.
IMAGINE A KEEPR HAS CORONA AND SPREADS IT TO THE 15 KEEPERS ILL BE IN LAUGHTER I CANT EVEN FEEL MYSELF
First 2 are good goli
Change ur camera angles to just straight we cant see the shot properly
Whoever reading this comment may you become a professional footballer in future
Yeeeeeeeeeh caman,,,,,
Bill your starting to go bald there pal 👶
F2  is the best . Like if u agree
I LOVED FANTASTIC
Petition for not rolling the ball before shooting
Get 100 keepers !!
#messi wingrove
F2 vs one bajillion keepers. Bill with free kicks like Bale. Jez with free kicks like Ronaldo and dribbling to right wing crosses it Bill does bicycle kick
Nice
You are a legend footballer
What the hell I can’t even score a goal with only one goalkeeper
Jeremy lynch the biggest prat on YouTube.
i don't get why they were all standing in the middle as a pack, why not just stand on the goal line and create a freakin brick wall
#bhai rip binod
The guy at the front who had dreadlocks couldn’t keep for his life
They act like they lost but they beat 15 keepers😂😂😂
Hello idol 🇰🇭
ARE YOU KIDDING ME 16??? well maybe try 100 😂😂 jk! Just try it and see how it goes
The whip is wild.. goodness gracious Bill
These goalkeepers are just what to say
F2 are such an inspiration  Can't score against 1 keeper  These boys score against 16 😐😐 One day for sure...one day 🤞
I imagine Davies would be on the ball.  Holt my meep meep
密です。
Love from Bangladesh ❤❤❤🇧🇩🇧🇩
Good save Reece
You two are real level freestyle legends
Keep social distance 😁😷😷     😅🤣
No one:   Billy: 8:31
Bruh that's more than a team
Nice challenge !!
So ur telling me 16 keepers can’t even close their angles 🤣
9:08 some keepers they are. Keep neuer alone in there he'll tackle the hell out of them
https://youtu.be/XQnw6cMOBxk
Barca:We should sign them they are better defenders then pique and kepers are better than her stegen
toi la nguoi VN Nice:3
f2:shooting against 16 keepers neymar:i am better than those keepers
There are 16 keepers and the vidoe is 16:17 min 😂😂😂😅😅
Im hyped!
the keepers should be covering angles like they would've taken places then youcant be able to score
why don’t they just line up along the goal
No need for 16 just get modern goalkeeping 😂
Billy or jez who's better for me jez
I love how it’s against 16 keepers and the vids 16 min longs
Who wants them to do 16 professional goalkeepers
Manchester Citi = Like 👍 Lyon = comment 📝
I 8-2 be a Barca fan now
Lol look at the positioning of the keepers ... Easy
I swear billy scored literally all of them
الكل ايحط لايك أعتقد اني اول عربي اعلق في هذا الفيديو⁦🇩🇿⁩
Who is more likely to become prime minister  Billy = like Jezza = comment
CORONAVIRUS
No one:   Burnley: When there drawing 0:0
I think Barca need 16 keepers last night to avoid the goals...
Playing agaisnt 16 keepers feels like when ure playing fifa 20 with ter stegen in the goal
Me seeing the thumbnail: wtf Watching the video : oh they're shite
I am a big fan from Nigeria 😍😍🤩
How it's possible?
Chelsea need to sign any 1 of em
6:48 Riyad Mahrez becomes GK
i the f2 should be pro
16 goalkeepers 16 minutes
Happy independence day INDIAN'S
😃😃😄😄🙃😂😋😋😷🤗
Wtf?16 gk
BRING PRANK WARS BACK
what happened to social distancing
Can I join your academy I am good
I think it is possible !!
This is how many goalkeepers barca needed against Bayern yesterday
🔥
Do rematch 16 keepers with weak foot
Gr8 video
Please practise social distancing.
😻 love it
Brilliant goalkeepers😘say hi to all of them
F2: "We brought in top goalies.. like.. they play for teams"   Also F2 Goalies: 12:03
i missed these type videos so much! love you guys
If you have thought about life sucks ,just look at those keepers
Best football channel
not impossible !!!!
Me: That was Awesome 👏   My mum who just seemed to be watching: well that’s not social distancing is it
Are YOU gryce
Let's call Roberto carlos
Wtfuck
Que bien que le pegan estos enfermos
Stupid
What if R.CARLOS would shoot with all his power 💪
Did anyone realise that they could all just stand on the goal line put up the arms,would hurt tho lol
4:45 When me and my friends saw a beautiful girl in the school
can you guys do reacting to fifa 21 top one hundred ratings and racing fifa 21 players in real life
You be the keeper
This is stupid, "all have to stand on the penalty spot" basically, then just curl into the top corner. Could be 55 standing on the spot. Go back to the gimme keeper so you's can look talented.
That little dark spot on the left side of the video has been bugging me the whole time
738
Omg Hi ❤
Waooo very nice ❤️ brother what is Ur from? Im big fan to u.... I'm from Assam north east...
Do 50 keepers in 2 hours
Social distanse be like
Couldn’t even save a word document
cambridge united where you at? 👇
They should’ve spread out in the goal
Who is better jazz like Bill comment
Me trying to predict the goal by the music 😂
😲👍👍👍
Jesus christ
Man Billy's top bins were phenomenal
When the whole team gets in the net in pro clubs real life version:
Wtf
Who is better jazz like bill comment
You should get a keeper for the mini-goal Now that would be the hardest challenge
Love it
The keepers are in the middle. If they were well positioned they would score much less goals.
Are they not allowed to talk?
what are your real names
Me: missing open goals. The F2: scoring with 15 goalkeepers. Whattttt??????😭😭😭😔😔😔
I mean 16 keepers yeah it's tuff. But do they know positioning ?
Guys can you review all your soccer boots
reminds me of wii tennis where you would swing and both characters would swing
Next video: SHoTtInG vS 32 KeEpErS AnD sCoRiNg
Huge love ❤ from india
Guess thats what Barcelona needed yesterday 😂
Please like my comment f2
With F2 everythink is possible💚🇧🇩❤
This straight up looks like a fifa glitch😂
No one: Sheffield united
These 16 keepers would have saved bayern’s 8 goals against barca
F2: OMG this is going to be tough.  Messi : why fear when I am here!!! Ronaldo : wait, let's battle to find who is the best!!!!!  Me : I can't score past 2 goal keepers( this is the truth)
Nice super
I can't stop thinking about it 😂😂😂😂 8-2 😂😂😂😂 Who all get it?
New sub u got here 🤪
this is actually a brilliant video idea, well done F2!
The power and accuracy in those shots were insane🙌💥
Jezza was superb!🔥
Nobody:   F2: WHAT A SAVE!!!!!!
hey f2 i love ur channel and i also would like u to take a look at dis challenge   i want u guys to play a ball made out of tape tanx and bye
4:54 ter stegen yesterday 😂😂
If you see this...God bless you and family
They are so good!!
I get lucky when I have 1 keeper to train with idk what I’m doing wrong
these guys are running out of ideas
The first three keepers was best
How the keepers in the back can see the ball????🤔🤔🤔
16 keepers,  16 minute video
Which bargain bin did you get these ones from...
F2 vs 10 alphonso Davies
🇹🇭 👇​
If Barcelona only knew. They would have atleast recruited them and we wouldnt have faced all that embarrassment
8 -2
How many Keepers are needed to keep a clean sheet!!😂     a small youtuber here
ok
This challenge shows who is better shooter
Is it just me who thinks they could actually get passed 16 keepers but chose not to show it to be humble and give credit to keepers.
how many tries have hit the post 32 thats more
Watching you both makes goosebums
WOW! amazing!
F2 vs F16
This is how bayerns keeper lookes like to barća yesterday
I Am fan of Barça and you?
Easy shot
Big faan
Kepa worst gk
Billy and Jezz scored with 10 keepers in goal. Lingard makes scoring against 1 keeper look impossible
5>best video c/>
Nice guys.
They wouldn’t of even got to the 16 keeper stage if they let them stand in better position other than all centre !
“ 1m restriction rules just went down the drain “😯 sshuuuuuuush 🥱😂no one cares
16 keepers, 16 minute video  "Coincidence? I THINK NOT!"
2:58 golden touch from the cameraman
20
Why are all the goalkeepers in the middle
This video made me hate keepers more
I LOVE YOU F2 IM FROM SYRIA
Keepers were awesome the goal u lads scored were phenomenal .
F2: LİKE FREEKİCKERS:COMMENT
This is how bayern wins against barca.
you are amazing  ..everytime i see your videos..i get inspired...iam also an goal keeper too🤩🤩🤩
Please
https://youtu.be/BoMj0xfqVm0
Whole team of keepers inculing substitute  Just stand in a line across the goal 🤨
One question How much time taken to compete it Plz Comment F2
Discover MRU
Obviously the keepers from a Sunday-Farmer-League, smh
There ar so many keepers, so why the are not standing on the edge of te net. They all are standing in centre
FT is the most entertaining channel on YouTube hands down ✅🦍💥
This is how many keepers barca wanted against bayern
16 Lenos are very easy to score against
6:50 Riyad Mahrez entered the lobby.
F2: we are gonna prove that our keepers are good  also F2: *scoring against 16 keepers* (PS: they r decent keepers and yeah they scored against just 15 xd , just kidding)
these keepers look very unhappy ☹️🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why don’t u try signing for a professional club??? It looks like you all r gr8 I mean maybe you could be really good in professional games
Cool
I'm telling you if The F2 brought Roberto Carlos with them to do this "Keeper Challenge" I guarantee that you will see no Keeper in net. I mean ask the French GK who tried to save Robert Carlos's Free Kick in the 1998 World cup 🤣🤣
F2 For Life Who Watch this video Like This Comment
What about corona virus
It,s awesome
How many times they said beautiful and lovely
They all are standing in the middle
So are we just going to ignore the fact that all 9 of them stood by and let that shot go in ?
8:16 what a shot
heard the balls are magnetic to the top bins
Anyone noticed here 8:33 everyone in goal just made the same movement? lol
Bring predator back and f2fc
F2 vs 20 keepers + THE PREDATOR
If only  they actually spread out in the goal properly
Great safe loved that
This the best 16 goalkeeper football challenges I have ever seen in my football life man and you guys are smashing it with football freestyle tricks or skills F2 freestylers or bros even!❤❤⚽️⚽️⚽️💯💯💥💥🔥🔥🔥🌟🌟💫⭐👀👀😱😱😱🤙🏾🤙🏾👍🏾👍🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾

This 16 keepers is equal to THE NAVAS.                                            agree so like don't like dislike
Always better better and better . Finally one day you both became my ideal 😍

Billy that fake shot was cheeky
Love you
WTF
Omg u guys r insane 16😱
Hi f2
F2 should go pro imagine pro football jezza and Bill
Literally all keepers were standing in the middle leaving the corners open
we need 5 keepers and 6 defenders
no woman?
Can you do a tutorial on a bunch of shooting techniques like the swaz and explain how to do them
I think if they didn’t all stand in 1 line then there’s no way that they would have got that far
16 Keepers defeated in 16 minutes 💪💪💪. Well done ''F2''
Nice
can you make detail tutorial on how to do swaz
Billy is a better shooter than jezza but I love jezza more
RIP social distancing
https://youtu.be/NnbiepXbd8o

We want part 2 f2 vs 20 legendary goal keepers.
anyone notice that is 16 minutes long
Finally,goalkeepers came that really work.The goalkeeper in other videos was a dummy.The difference between the previous goalkeeper and me was he was watching f2 live and am watching in youtube😂😂😂
Was it jusr me that noticed but it was 16 keepers and the vid was 16 minutes long
they couuldve just spread out
You are shooting so close to the keepers😂
😮🔥🔥🔥🔥🤤🤤🤤♥️♥️♥️ nice guys ⚽🥅🥅
Just cover the corners and they won't score simple  Kepa logic player manager
Goalkeeper-positioning: 0,264 / 10
the fact that they are able to score past more than 5 keepers is amazing
Fact:it's impossible to watch an F2 video without smiling
I’m a keeper to!
Guys I need help reaching 300🔥Any help/support is appreciated
Corona has left the chat
you are youtube  legends🤙🏻💪🏻
I think this many goalkeepers can save barca
It's a shame as a goalkeeper to see this🤦‍♂️ like really some many keepers and they still score
Why are every goalkeeper not standing on the line ?
Top
Omg
U guys had a great kick...love from Indian manipur

Well i dont want to insult ter stergen or anything but these keepers played better than he did last night
this is realy hard challenge
F2 fan like this  comment♡
So satisfying seeing all the keepers not budge and just stare at the ball fly past them 😂
Why didn't they just stand in a line on the goal line
to be honest that challenge was really hard
F2 In 2050 : Scorinng a goal without touching the ball
whats the song at 11:00 ?
Social Distanting at its finest
The best🔥
now that's swazz
16 keepers with a 16 min video
Good video
These lot got no brain cells
I though Billy and Jezz were not going to score a goal but Jezz did, Imagine if they allowed that amount of goalkeepers in a real soccer game.
Making Impossible Possible is the work of freestylers.
Why not 17 keepers
who wants f2 to start prank wars like before   👇
Fam, if Billy and Jezza vs top 16 pro goalkeepers, they would get offers from Juventus to Real Madrid.
409
💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This insane guys!!!@
8_2 bayern 😂😂😂
Nice
That was mad
In 2025: F2 : Today we will score goal without a ball.    Ball commits suicide
Omg 😅
Well done
Easy work: Roberto can power shoots.
Anyone in this chat pls pls subscribe to our channel
their consistency is actually incredible

Social distancing? Or this before
Make ps 5 unboxing video
What a crazy challange
Me: oh i can't do goal to 1 keeper F2: ToDaY We ShOohT aGainSt 16 keEEPeRs
For me: If There was no keeper F2: Bring 8 pairs and let us do the work
yo wtf, more keepers more, mb next time you will shoot against ppl that died due to coronavirus or make new history of that one that has been already done in 1939? Cool idea isnt it? (no offense, all i said here is just for fun without hurting someones feelings)
https://youtu.be/R93VpCGDNDY
