I want you to help host a Pitfight Tournament and help design the arena.
Perfect punishment for the cheaters in Pokémon. I want a permanent Pitfight in the highest layers of The End in Minecraft’s 2b2t. It would combine the best Minecraft prisons with the colosseum and a place to PvP in a 2b2t tournament.
I wonder if you're allowed to use Withers, Iron Golems, Wardens, or other mobs to help fight.

I love the "if everyone has an advantage, no one has an advantage" style of these fights. Because _everyone_ is using hacks, it becomes a game of skill again, around just how well you can manage your hack client and play the game at the same time, while countering other hacks you may not be familiar with.

Can anyone give me the timestamp for when FitMC said “Don’t bring a bow to a crystal fight.”? Many people are quoting him, but I didn't hear him say it. Did he even say it or are you mass gaslighting me? I searched through the transcript by selecting all the text and searching through it in Notepad (YouTube should really allow us to search through it easily), but I couldn't even find the word "bow".

It's safer for the spectators to be much further away since freecam can go as far as your render distance. Right below they can easily be attacked after withers destroy the arena.

Don't bring a bow to a crystal fight It's crazy how different crystal PvP is. It's a strategic, endurance-based contest. And the different strategies one can do, too! Who would've thought Withers would be powerful not because of damage output but because of their spleefing ability?

This but without hacks, so just traditional PVP, would be very interesting to watch too
Actually, you probably would want to bring a bow to a crystal fight...   Especially in 1.12 when you don't have crossbows. Weakness arrows used to be good but hacks make them less good now, slow falling arrows help you get crystal combos, harming arrows do tons of damage, and if that weren't enough, this is a video of THE best crystal pvpers on 2b2t, and even they're using bows! What more proof could you need that it's a great idea to bring a bow to a crystal fight?
I like the people that were on top sniping away, but still, you should not bring a bow to a Crystal fight.

What happens to the arenas after the events are done, do they have a cleanup crew come in and delete or are they just left for the griefers like historical bases/builds are?  Also has the server ever had any legal issues/incidents that went beyond the anarchy status?

I've been playing MC since the last alpha/first beta version. I've always been a builder, not keen on pvp (and admittedly nor the pve) and because of my upbringing, I don't really find using hacks, griefing etc. enjoyable so servers like 2b2t just aren't attractive for me at all. But this seems fun even for me. It just goes to show how versatile mc is.

I'm confused as to why the referee allowed all those PvPers to attack the audience anyways despite the rules. Not to mention, by exposing all those PvPers and audience members without a filter, all those hundreds of thousands of viewers watching the video might swarm them, asking for a invite no matter what. Also, are the previous underground  tournaments on YT under certain names to watch (and given the new patch is soon to be up, will the players have access to netherite in future events)?

Are you aware there is an exploit that can make you invulnerable but will prevent you from moving, rotating your camera or placing blocks? It involves nether portals and suspending packets from being sent to the server as it keeps you invulnerable when travelling between dimensions. Assuming it is not patched by the servers anticheat you could theoretically use this exploit to spectate these events without being attacked using freecam as your player remains in stasis.

Eh, they're all using hacks.  Yeah being able to coordinate and manage all the stuff at once without being kicked by the anticheat is as you said hard. But winning this without hacks is technically possible even though your chances of winning the largest lottery in history with only a single ticket is probably higher, winning the 2b2t pitfight without hacking *edit - and being solo* is technically still possible with an UNFATHOMABLY EXTREME amount of luck and skill.  Now I may not be able to gamble and pay the person who wins this without hacks or exploits and with playing solo (if that ever were to happen which, again, it could and is technically possible but the chances are so absurdly low it's probably not worth it).  I still would pay them for their achievement in my own way.  They record it and put it on YouTube or whatever and I begin to open and duplicate a few thousand tabs of the video and play them each on loop and at 25% speed for a full week straight.  I've given many other channels such absurdly difficult challenges and offered the same reward but so far none of these challenges I've proposed have been completed.  My offer to do this still stands.  I still swear on my life if one of the absurdly difficult challenges I suggest are completed I will keep my promise but eh.  Probably not gonna happen any year soon, if at all.

0:28 And there's truth behind that assumption: It's always not Hacker vs Hacker, but Hacker vs non-Hacker. And if it comes to 2 hackers meeting in a match, it's very rare that they fight each other, most of the time they just run away from each other, or only one of them wants to fight. In your example, these players aren't even using the hacks those no-skill hackers use; force field, aim bot, reach. But yes, it is very fun to watch hacker vs hacker. (in like 100 hacker reports, 1 had a hacker vs hacker fight)
"Hacker vs Hacker requires skill!" Duh xD

Respect for the amount of time, energy and patience it takes to set stuff like this up from the people running it.  Administration of groups and getting people together is hard enough but throw in the fact you’re dealing with a lawless community ready to pop off whenever, it’s pretty sweet.

Hey, Fit. I just wanna say that you have much more potential for discussing other Minecraft topics. I'm not saying that you should stop with you're currently doing, I'm just saying you could do so much more than just 2b2t. I've been watching your videos for some time now & have been thinking. "Have you considered discussing other Minecraft topics before"? I understand if you wish not to & Don't mind at all if you want to keep making with 2b2t content. After all, It's what you're good at.
