Yeah, it may be only a preseason game, but that first penalty call... good grief, as convincing evidence as there ever was that VAR is essential to the integrity of the game.
Two goal keepers best players on pitch, rest were so bad. Thought I watching a league one game! They both better improve fast fr start of season, Leeds shud have got 3 goals easy, Dan James lacks composure, missed so many chances by rushing snatching....slow down ys bell end, we are Leeds coaches doing n saying? James never learns! 🤣
7:31 in case like this where the player doesn't even apologetic toward his reaction, need to be kicked back. They should make a rule like this. Either kick back or 1 year wages goes to the victim. Select 1.
Best Double save since Almunia and then a 1 on 1 was just unbelievable reflex save👍👍👍 Wasnt a pen in the first place, but fantastic saves By Meslier👏👏👏
Melier is the next lloris
Who else thought that Brenden Aaronson plays very much like Johnny Giles
Ings looks like angry young don carleone
Now day the VAR doesn't work how it's possible the referee don't take his own time and gona to see the monitor it wasn't penalty it was awful decision referee the tecnologia you have and made mistakes like that it's awful I think    the ladies are more better referee than man's I can see the level in the euro women's.
Good saves by the keeper but why travel that distance for a friendly. Certainly plenty of options in Europe, doubt fan base or shirt sales will increase like Man Utd or the Scousers.
Well impressed with how the new signings look at this stage MOT
What a signing Leeds have got in Tyler Adams
for sure, Meslier the next No. 1 GK France
Leeds United good game, Meslier respectively
Meslier is a huge talent
That was a red card tackle by John McGinn if I've ever seen one. Terrible refereeing
My boy Brendan Aaronson tearing up those defensive lines. This is gonna be one squad to follow.
Mid table or both
We need a clinical striker. Bamford is good we want to strike fear in the opposition defenders.
Can we please move on from Dan James..Yes he puts in a shift but clearly Championship standard
Lovely tackle by mcginn, hard but fair
didn’t do much wrong at all, 2 penalties 1 goal scored, get their shooting boots back on and we’re looking good
Leeds mush, here. Glad they got beat because of "cheating" by the Davies one. Anymatch, anywhere, if they be cheats, esp in a "friendly". Not on....Hope he learns from it !
Appealing tackle made worse being a friendly. Mark McGinn out for 'treatment' at ER
davis not good enough. too close for hndbll.
ings and mcgin look like cumbrian tarmac layers ffs. do they live in white transits?
james and bamford missing everything as usual. aaronson superb, fast accurate decision making in last third. DESPERATE for a decent striker ffs. Everything crossed for terrier.
Ik ruik Feyenoord voor sini tch?❤️🤍
I think leeds players know its not soccer but rockby
I think leeds players know its not soccer but rockby
Villa fans are nothing but Crossroads Benny's and just as thick with no reputation and get put in their place in the city that owns the name. "We have won more trophies than you" ha ha ha. 45 years head start on us and most of what Villa have won were in the Jurassic Park era. Open their trophy cabinet and Madeleine McCann would probably walk out. No one cares about Villa outside of Birmingham. I find it highly amusing when a Scumchester fan gets lost but somehow manages to find themselves on our official channel to tell us that Villa are bigger. Probably never visited theirs ha ha ha. Carry on with your one sided rivalry. You aren't remotely close to our radar.
This tells us what we already knew we need a striker. Bamford is all or nothing and Dan James couldn’t hit a cows arse with a banjo.
Dan James striker again for fucks sake …not impressed defence wide open
i've said this sine his Midtjylland days...Rasmus Kristensen looks like an absolut  lunatic! There are plenty  of players stronger than him. But his mix of aggressiveness, physical intensity, buzzcut and wild crazy eyes, are actually  fairly intimidating (pretty rare for footballers) 😨
Villa fans outnumbered Leeds 70:30 - good turnout from both clubs.
Whats the difference between a villa fan and a DC10?.....A DC10 stops whining when it gets to benidorm
meslier absolute beast in goal
Hopefully mcgin gets what’s coming his way sometime soon….scumbag
Aaronson is going to be special
Seems to me that we were far better than villa and the only way they were capable of getting a goal against us was  from a penalty that's just based on these highlights
Leeds keeper man of the match. Some incredible saves!!
Good work 🔥Leeds⚡
Mcginn why?
Daniel James very very bad No lucky
Disgraceful from mcginn
Kristensen is our best signing so far imo
James needs to start scoring alot more. He always shoots but hardly scored for us.
Hehe, this pre-season match looked like a real EPL match😉
John McGinn what a nob
Imagine being proud of taking a 16 year old out 🙄🤷‍♂️
I'm convinced  we will finish next season above that shower of Brum shite. Comfortably, too.
Time to stop crying about the McGinn challenge since he won the ball and Leeds weren’t exactly playing in “friendly” mode either. Was a fair game, hope the kid has a safe and speedy recovery 🙏🏼
I went to this game and the atmosphere was crazy, good game❤‍🔥🔥🔥
Villa, bunch of thugs and animals 👎👎👎
some doggy calls from ref my dase
What a garbage penalty call on Adam’s! But an unreal double save! I do Love how the Leeds players came to Adam’s defense and the relatively low emotional response from him for the bad call!
As an American I’m really excited to see Leeds this season with 2 of my boys being signed
Sorry but James still misses too many chances for me, good all round team performance though
Meslier what a keeper !
Tell me theres not shades of pack-chasing the ball like a under-11's game? 🤔
Dan James please work on your finishing. Had 3 beautiful passes from roca, arronson
Aaronson brilliant no.7
I went to this game yesterday and it was a fucking blast...a real sporting atmosphere with both sets of fans sitting together and enjoying a real spectacle.. Plus Villa won but great friendly banter 👍✌️👍✌️
get ronaldo x
I was there and met a bunch of Leeds players it was lit
Dan James could have had a hat trick,at least now he is hitting the ball on target as opposed to kicking it in the stands,that is a massive improvement 👍
Is no one else ravings the Tyler Adams hand ball? It so very clearly wasn't his hands that hit the ball, your hands don't come directly out of your chest!
Daniel james nic performance
Can someone just give me some advice. I subscribed to LUTV from New Zealand, tried to watch the delayed coverage of the Brisbane game but it said content not available in this country. Yet it allows me to watch the full coverage of the Blackpool game. Is LUTV exclusive just to the UK .
Think we have a lot of problems ahead. Probably go down
The premier league is gonna be very competitive this season
Dirty Villa.
some really promising performances there despite the result + Archie. Feel like we've always got a defensive mistake in us unfortunately but attacking look very fluid
How did Aaronson play?
I'm seeing some little bit of improvement. Hope we gonna smash Palace 🔥 And pray for Archie 💛💙
The first half our players played very well and we can compet with aston vill and ther players with a lot of money we played very well but the second half we was a poor our players cant build up and transition from the back to front the first pass we need more players to be honest
Dan James should of buried some of them chances
that is one of the worst refs i have ever seen in my life were the hell did they find him ???... and as for mgin .. doing that to a 16 year old in pre season from a pro like him was disgusting
Gray didnt go in properly he went in half heartedly and got hurt its what happens when you pull out of a challenge
Villa will definitely be relegated, they're utter shite
McGinn should have been sent off for that challenge 🤦🏻‍♂️
When are leeds gonna buy some players? Or do they want to go down this season?
biased commentary much? I get this is LU Offical channel but at least pretend to be neutral for the 90 minutes. No mention of the simulation for the secone penalty for one.
6:46 can anyone tell me why this hurt his face so much?
Can see we need a striker being in the box read to pounce rest of the squad looks solid tbh
not bad at all leeds just need to work on the defense a bit city fan here
Quiet happy with that performance , hopefully we will improve , Meslier though is hot property.
I think James looks like a totally reformed player. Looks calmer, more disciplined. I think he'll turn out for us this season
Good performance in a very dirty game thanks to a below par ref! In much need of a clinical cf, as much as I like James and Bamford we need a proven goal scorer👌
No Keenan Davis on the subs bench ? Is he off back to Forest ?
Dan James had a god number of chances...just couldn't finish one
Super save penalty
Beautiful action from Leeds
Well done John McGinn. Hope Leeds go down this season.
Leeds are pony. UTV
Ya got shut of Phillips, didn't ya? And what about Raphinha? Did you show him the door, too?
Don't hate me - AV 🦁  fan here - I know not everyone will agree but IMO both sides were competitive throughout as our games often are. Although I do think the Ref lost a little control with some poor decisions which led to some irritation creeping in. I am sorry about Gray, although a poor foul it wasn't intentional, McGinn isn't like that, he is feisty but not mean.   One specific note as some have commented. IMO competitive preseason games are a plus as you want to test the team so you know what areas to specifically focus on for the looming start of the season.   Game aside, I do want to say that I do have a lot of respect for how Leeds play and I enjoy the fact that the players take our matches as seriously as we fans do.  And for what it's worth, I both love and hate playing you 😆 as its always so unpredictable. I loved Bielsa, old school unique brand and can see how Marsche is building on it  IMO you look sharp, fast and there's now more control and maturity in how the team plays. Good look in the coming season..except against us 😆
Dirty bastard McGinn. Hope he gets done this season. No room for Ayling in this side
Meslier did huge great saves and  Robin Olsen is a good keeper, But We got so many chances and we can't route it into net ,our final touch is so poor,it has to be improved
James,Koch not premier league level
Played well should of been a draw, none of them were penalties. Poor decision very harsh.
Commentator is deluded (surprise) it’s a blatant hand ball
We really need a left back and a striker, those are a must. A back up GK and a quality center back we can also use, but those are of lesser priority.
dan james brilliant...plenty of goals of him this season ..
2 superb keepers
Idiot commentators. Do they think we appreciate a stupidly bias opinion when we have our own eyes and brains? Second save from Meslier was top notch. Good work out more important than the result.
Need a LB offer a billion for Robinson
These PKs for handballs,  it’s become a joke.   Players can’t amputate their arms to play this sport.  Arms go up, in often “unnatural” looking ways, so a player can keep balance when lunging , jumping, doing anything athletic basically.  It’s very natural, though looks awkward in a slow mo replay.   Why give what should be a free goal, often deciding games, over accidental hand balls?   Makes zero sense, other than we’ve all just gotten used to it.
Up the villa
pre season referee looks ready to screw Leeds over (again)
See yah later gray get splatterd by meatball utv😂😂
expected more from leeds today,,  kind of sat back first half,,  looks like its a more restrained game under the new boss,,   which mght be more effective,,   villa decent and controlled the first half,,  second half was a clown fest but still of interest,,  good workout,,,
Watkins 1 on 1 ...i repeat with him up top we're going no where
Time we got another striker Sell James and Fitpo bogof deal 😀
When will we join MLS..!?
The Lousy Refereeing appears to follow Premier teams, even while not playing in the premier league.
Dunno if tjat was a penalty i think he was protecting his face
Glad to see bamford playing. If he gets back to form hes a good goal scorer. Last season couldnt of been any worse for him
People asking for a red for McGinn clearly haven't been Leeds fans for long or have severe dementia
Shouldn't be feigning a head injury for the second pen
Great double save from Meslier tbf, just a shame he was off his line. In a PL match that would be a re-take. Hope your boy is ok, nasty follow through. Unfortunate.
Looks like the ref only gave the foul when he seen Archie stay down. Also what was going on with that second pen? Pretending it his face lol
Fucking good game questionable ref
McGinn will get a nice "friendly" leeds welcome next time we see him
Meslier!!!!! Improving!!!! So happy
We looked great all game against Dirty Villa.
This referee should retire, he does not know the difference between ball to hand or deliberate handball
Great game, Meslier was GOD, gracefully the result wasn't in our favor and we have to improve to start the season well, the defense may improve and Bamfort I hope he recovers his level like in 20/21
Having been at the game it was interesting to see that most of the Villa fans were wearing brand new replica kit, whereas our fans were wearing battleworn jerseys spread across many decades.
Dan James is so overated I cant believe people cant see it , the amount of times he should of scored , I think he would be good in a championship club at best , in the prem he is not good enough
Thanks for the win up the villa
Think they looked decent tbf… not sure what all the negativity is about. Players still gelling and shaking off rust. Good effort lads!
No raphina no Phillips no premiership……
Championship pending……
Mark Viduka really left a Huge legacy and massive influence for the Aussie to support Leeds United even they were not competed in the top flight League more than a decade.
Spiderman Spiderman does whatever Meslier can!
Dan James is so bad
So will McGinn's bail money be coming from gerrard or from the club owners
What a shit penalty and follow up miss haha
Strikers strikers strikers....  ..
Leeds created chances but diffensevly still need some good quality  signings.
As usual we get a shite ref lol, challenge on gray was nasty pick on someone your own age bully
Agora vcs já sabem quem é o batedor oficial danny ingles
Did a Villa player injure one of yours?
I know we lost but fuck me we do look good
It looks better than last pre season but we still need that striker and LB signing. With Raphinha gone we’ll struggle for goals if Bamford gets injured again.
The Lads played well Meslier man of the match for Leeds good again to see the new Lads get a run out the ref was hopeless Mcgin should of been sent off over 40,000 good turnout by the Supporter's 🦚 Leeds everywhere 😍🤩 Dan James played well again. Still need a striker & a left back Victor. Marching on together, we all love Leeds 🦚🇮🇨✊👊
Not bad we played well in stages by looks of it, unlucky not to get a point at least
Meslier man of match
Dan James has improved, but he still can’t finish. Marc roca is gonna be our standout player this season. Also we need a striker for gods sake.
Great goalkeeping by Meslier for the first penalty and justice was done, as that was not handball.  Good to see Leeds have a large following in Australia.  The injury to Gray: not saying it was intentional, but if you watch the slow-motion replay you can clearly see the Villa player going in studs up and not looking into the tackle.  Poor technique, at the very least.  Hope Gray recovers quickly.
If that challenge was in regular life it would be straight up child abuse
The handball rule is so dumb. I guess everyone should walk around with their hands behind their backs. Sometimes the ball hits the hand, that in and of itself shouldn't make it a handball. But they constantly change the rule and I don't think anyone knows the rule anymore. the "natural position" interpretation is silly too, it seems to be viewed as natural is only when your arm is straight down touching your leg, which is extremely unnatural when playing football.
A clumsy defensive moment by the defender caused us defeat! Central Defence looks vulnerable! Not quick enough!! Must bring an experienced reliable Centre Back before window closes!!
i was at the game great atmosphere
Watkins AGAIN! through on goal misses the chance ~???? The dude frustrates me so bad how many he gonna miss this season again?
Villa fan here. Archie comes on and immediately gets a yellow then gets fouled back. That's what I call justice. If you don't like that it would serve you right if he's out for the season 👍🏻
Bamford went missing …as usual …..
Big man mcgin well done fella hurt a 16 year old kid
The ref and linesmen were abysmal. Hope to never see them on a football pitch again .
Adams  is  crap.  I  know  is  only  pre-season  but   looks  like  the  team  still  aren't  good  enough  even  with  the  new  signings.
I only hope no injure player this season!! All player IS back...👍 Keep fighting LEEDS
Tough season ahead for Leeds.
John McGinn doesn't have the spirit of a professional player.
Good Game Leeds Well Battle
Jury is out for everyone except Meslier. Lads are not quite sticking yet but we still got month and a half to figure it out.
Got feisty out there absolutely no need for that challenge on gray it was payback for an earlier gray foul could see it coming a mile away
Not impressed with Leif Davis at all. He's simply not fast enough to track back. And to think he tried to fake getting shot in the face, when it was a handball, is idiotic. It's clever thinking, but it's not the smart thing to do. It's just embarrassing for the fans. Just admit the foul and move on. Meslier though, what a game he had!
Leeds keeper awesome, man of the match for me. Leeds fans moaning about McGinns tackle on Grey seem to forget Grey's earlier tackle that left his opponent needing leagnthy treatment, Grey's tackle for me was the worse of the 2 but neither warrented a red! On both penalties Leeds tried to con the ref (great saves on the 1st pen) but what a cheat on the 2nd implying the ball hit him in the face, dirty Leeds up to their normal tricks with bender Bamford his usual self (detest the man) I'm surprised no one tried to buy James tbh, never stops working!  UTV SOSH
Think we actually had the better chances and deserved something from that.   Besides two soft pens, Villa had virtually nothing in that game.
Unlucky had chances but that tackle straight red in the prem
New signings look good, disgraceful tackle on Archie. We were unlucky not to get something from the game. MOT ALAW
Thank you for traveling to Queensland, Australia! It was a ripper game watching it Live
should’ve won this tbf
McGinn has always been vermin...
Ref was a melt , no way worthy of a penalty , the ref was looking for any excuse , he was protecting his nose been broken , villa got away with Murder ,.Mcginsters needs to give his potatoe munching head a wobble, clearly trying to.bully a young lad for a naive challenge earlier in the game . We played really well though , we look promising so far
Meslier incredible. Dan James MUST work on finishing as top priority if he’s going to constantly find himself in positions to have a crack at goal.. Bamford still doesn’t look at full power
A good game to realistically show where the lads are at rn
Hahahaha cry
Meslier was brilliant. We just need a striker but new signings looking good. Just hope Gray is OK after that reckless challenge
Love to play against mcginn he would  know what a tackle is arsehole
Well played the scoreline does nothing to sum this game
💛
Are these the Leeds highlights or highlights of the game. Why is there no Aston villa attacks or was it a one sided game.
Bro I was there
I think we should of won the match not villa onhestly tho
That penalty save from Meslier.. outstanding.
Played some nice stuff despite the loss.
The Americans are actually standing out more than I thought they would they seem great but they rely to much on passes it seems sometimes I wish they would just shoot the ball
If only we had someone who could put the ball in the net and not right at the keeper
Looks like there was some promising cutting passes from the 3 new midfielders.
Coward McGinn knows his Scottish International career is about to be replaced with Archie Gray who at 16 is far superior to anything he ever done.
Dan James body is too quick for his brain, boy just fluffs it in front of goal consistently. Love the dynamic feel of the midfield and really like the look of Aaronson. Typical dirty challenge from McGinn, absolute scummer of a player.

Talk about Bias- You put your arms up like that and it even glances- its a pen!!!  Both keeper M-O-T-M
I think Leeds will win more games this season, especially against sides in the bottom half of the table. They will probably lose home and away to teams going for top 6.
วิลลาใช้แต่พลังไม่ใช้สมอง
Honestly those shots by James were pretty damn good, if he puts his head down and works on shooting with some proper dedication I think we could be seeing 10-15 G/A
Didn't realise premier league officials were officiating today as well 🤓
McGinn is a disgrace. How does he not spend half of every season banned?
How did we lose
Villa are pretty average considering all the money pumped into the squad over the lastfew years.
Surely they now are going to tick off that pre-season bucket list that you have to keep those hands close to the body....
That referee gave villa the game worst reffing I've ever seen.
is the commentator sitting in a library?
Thought we played really well and I’m looking forward to the season.  We do need another striker to help out in the final third. I don’t understand how Aston Villa didn’t get the memo about this being friendly. Hope Gray is going to be alright. Come on Leeds!!
New signings bedding in well, we looked the better team. Exciting times...
Really hope Archie is ok
Aronson plays in Harrison instead of bamford and we go one up.. different game then. Need to be more clinical in the pl
Liking the little intricate peices of play between the players. Very unfortunate to lose courtesy of the impaired brain of the referee. But hey it's only pre season, Leif Davis, I'm sorry to say needs to move on. Not convinced with keeping klich and Rodrigo they also need to be moved on in my opinion.
Feel like with kalimoundo in the line up some of this chances would get slotted home so I’m still happy despite the loss
Because of the economic crisis and the rate of unemployment, now is the best time to invest and make money 💯
Brilliant Save From Illan Meisler The Iceman Sensasional. Leeds United Defeat Againts Aston Villa In The Optus Stadium.
You guys lose the game, I won the bet.
Absolutely shocking, defence clueless as usual. McGinn should have sent off for that.
The rat goes studs up on a 16 yr old hope your OK Archie
Aston Villa are thugs, just like their manager.
We'll take 6 points from Villa this upcoming season without a doubt.
ABSOLUTE disgusting challenge on gray isn't it a friendly game hope he is ok! Well played Leeds especially MESLIER fantastic 💙💛💙
Shocking tackle for a friendly by a captain
Dan James. Why we still got him. Too many chances missed
Absolutely horrid referee, with poor decision after poor decision.
That McGinn tackle was hardly malicious, literally a millisecond too late, nothing in it.  Red card ? Pfffffffft 😂😂😂
VILLA UP TO THERE USUAL SHITHOUSERY!! MCGANN’S GOT IT COMING!!!!
When’s orta gonna realise we need a decent proven mature left back !!  Another creative mid won’t go a miss and a decent striker. The tackle in Gray was outrageous leaving the studs in the kid. He should be banned for first 3 matches. It’s a f king pre season game !! Arsehole
Don’t know what’s more disgusting McGinn’s tackle on a child or McGinn’s face!!!!
Kids don't realise they should NEVER  go into a tackle slightly earlier ..(make it a 50/50 or slightly late ) especially against a senior pro who has a nasty streak.......
Villa are just rich Burnley it seems
How did McGinn not get a red card?
So many Leeds fans compared with villa. It’s never a friendly against that lot. Lots of positives. Hope Grey will be ok, gutted for him. 🤍💙💛
Leeds needs to make proper signings before they get relegated next season.  Raphina and Kaivin Phillips must be properly replaced.
For all those fans saying we need a new keeper watch this performance from meslier, hes our number 1 and was great last season, he just needs a better defence in front of him
Same problems as last season can't take our chances. Hope Archies ok
I’m a new Leeds guy by way of the Philadelphia union.  I absolutely love their heart!  I’ve alway just followed the US players and never really had a team!  Love  the Leeds fanbase an the whole organization.
Leeds need a striker .
Friendly Match?
We have looked brilliant in pre season but again which is typical Leeds wobbly defence haha … hopefully we get a decent LB in like tagliafico from Ajax or I’d even take ZINCHENKO from city tbh but a striker is also needed bamford just looks slow and so off the mark I think he’s done tbf
Wonder where they dug up that ref? Hopeless performance.
Hope mcginn is proud of himself , stamping on a teenager ffs .
Love😡🍆🥒 you McGinn
As I went to this game, the referee was terrible. The tackle on archie gray was a red card, the first penalty given to villa were poorly refereed. Honestly, I think we should've won if he had of had a good ref.
som1 should of gone off at that weird looking hills have eyes mcginn for that tackle on a 16 year old kid
Absolutely awful challenge from McGinm.
They will get better it is just preseason it doesnt mean anything
Remembering when Leeds fans got all cocky to Villa
looked a bit like meslier stepped off the line on the pen, is that a rule in this?
These handball pens are a joke.   And so is our manager.
Villa were poor. The result didn’t match the performances.
Disgraceful from McGinn … Gerrard can say it was “unlucky” all he likes but to go studs up is not accidental and to do so in a pre-season friendly is just irresponsible and reckless
Quite unlucky with that Penalty. I can see the team is improving and hope they will keep that track in the league...
Shambolic from the officials,  lots of positives to take
Meslier great work today seems to have his confidence back James unlucky could have had 2 McGinn is a wanker a 16yo lad in a friendly trying to end his career before it begins
Still work to do, but well done to the lads for giving their all!
That ref clearly didn't like us, no way the first was a penalty.
WHY DID YOU LET THAT HAPPEN?
Supper unlucky lad we look great keep up the good work ALAW MOT 💙💛
what is mcginn thinking
Remind Villa this is preseason ffs, 3 weeks left until season starts you muppets! Hopefully Archie will be okay 🙏🏽 Really like what I’ve seen from all our signings. James needs to finish those, 2 sitters. Can’t wait to see Sinisterra vs Palace, Jesse confirmed he’s starting next game. Good to see Bamford play 60 👍🏽 Need a LB asap, Davis clearly not good enough. Hope Hjelde starts next game looked alright.
Close
Scoring goals could be a problem this season again. But we will see.
At 16 Physically should gray be in the first team?
Shocking officiating.  Stonewall penalty for us not given, minutes later gives Villa a penalty for a ball that clearly struck the chest.  Fails to penalise any of the bad challenges, as the game gets further out of hand.  Eventually gives the first yellow to Archie for a perfectly fair tackle, and minutes later fails to send off McGinn for going over the top of the ball and stamping on Grays ankle.  Yes McGinn is the villain for a ridiculous dangerous challenge, in a friendly, on a 16 year old, but the ref should never had let the game get to that point.   On a positive note, in the Prem with VAR this game would likely have been 1-1 (with one penalty given each), and Villa down to 10 men.
Cant wait for mcginn to get battered at ER😂😂😂scottish scumbag making that tackle on a 16 year old we'll have him
At the end Steven gerrard looked like he lost 10-0 lol
Unlucky lads
Unlucky today lads keep up the good work
Disappointed
Gg guys no worries 👍
RIP Gray❤️
