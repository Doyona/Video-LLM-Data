Absolute cinema.
Nah I’m giving Kenny my biggest respect
That why they call him KING Kenny
Wow
king kenny is the goat
KENNY YOU WON THAT BOXING MATCH
2 years after and i’m super proudddd of you KING KENNY!😭❤️ this is beautiful! everything! include you😂🤭
Nice one.
GOAT
Fair play to sensei he was a good sport unlike temperr who was a bad sport and fair play to kenny the best youtube boxer
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉Kenny what a banger
Yooo pls do a boxing match with betasquad and i will come fight💪
Omg this made me cry bc the support from his best friends and family too
Man honestly it's only been a week watching you and the beta squad guys but the respect and the connect I have built the goosebumps I get when the suspense part comes in the video it's different man considering that it's only been a week the connect I've built is crazy respect beta squad and you man peace
AMAZING INSPIRATIONAL MOVIE!! 🔥
Insane how he keeps his head down and grind without any drama. Kenny is a gem
Why this masterpiece still in Ks and not mils. This deserves more views, recognition and our king deserves more success. Love you Kenny❤️‍🩹 you make us so proud ❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹
Well done Kenny❤❤
Kenny you deserved this man! I honestly teared up a little! reminds me of how all the boys reacted
Aura.
i don’t care what everyone says. Whether it’s close or not you shouldn’t blame kenny. like can you hate the people that judge instead of the actual boxers. like come on both of them didn’t rig or cheat. they both just boxed and did their job. NAH NO MATTER WHAT, YOU CAN SEE THIS MANS WORK AND EFFORT. Screw faze because they were upset at the wrong person whether it was robbed or not. faze was wrong to do that 100%. But i understand groups lookout for their own groups and faze is a perfect example of just looking out for themselves
Kenny keep on going therbjust jealous🎉🎉
rewatching this like it's the first time i've watched this🙁❤ always makes my heart race. no comment, my favorite video from kenny
This is the best YouTube video ever  🔥🔥🔥
Someone told him he could box🤣🤣🤣looking like a flamingo out there.
Respect!!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤
Seeing this after him becoming on of the bests
❤❤❤❤
Those people are haters they thought that they could take away his win and happiness they are wrong Kenny deserves respect
no harm I like one of the faze clan members faze rug and I also like beta squad so I feel like its even for me
KING KENNYYY
I love. You KiNG KENNY 😩❤️‍🩹
Kenny won both fights👍🏾✌🏾♥️🙏🏾
L squad, sensei rocked ur sht. U lost
Anyone why are people saying he didn't
Kenny you are really good 💯  don't get me wrong
Beta Squad 1 Faze Clan 1…
he did not rig shit.. get over it he won and i think almost everyone agrees apart from that little small amount who are probs 12 yr olds
The best boxer is Kenny now✌️
It's so unfair for Kenny, the fight against temper was a really close one, it was either a draw or a slight win to temper, even I can admit that, but Kenny was amazing against him, both of them deserved that win tbh.   But the fight against sensei was legit won by Kenny mahn, the people online saying he didn't win are the dumbest people ever.   King Kenny, is a better fighter.
King 👑
The sidemen are right  It was closer than what the poeple are saying it was so close and its insiderstuff making him won
Kenny robbed both of them you can tell if you go rewatch it it’s just so funny how he thinks he won both 😂
love you kenny your so good
This sucks people complaining about a loss just get over it these men work hard just to risk their life for entertainment. Kenny deserves the win
its like a netflix documentary
This video, I swear to god, flipped a switch in me. Can’t believe it took me this long to stumble across this, but holy fuck. See you soon Ken, big up champ♥️
Wow what an amazing documentary! Truly inspiring. Well done Kenny, you did yourself and your family proud!
Wow unbelievable video well done Kenny your boxing is great💪👊🫡✅
Youre the goat kenny
go on kenny!!
Is that Tyrese haliberton
1 hit from chunkz made him even more insane
King Kenny 💗

King kenny wwwww 🤴
King Kenny for a reason!!!!
My fav🥹🥹❤❤
Sol cool
I was literally crying that was so motivational❤
Rd 1 sensei 10-9 Rd 2 kenny 10-9 Rd 3 draw  10-10 as they both brawl non stop Rd  4 kenny 10-9 39-38 kenny
ngl before this vid, the only faze member i knew was faze rug
king kenny is stronger
The shock on Kenny face when he heard watford was everything
Idc what anyone says Kenny on top!
Kenny is the best
i'm  year late but I SO PROUD FOR YOU OMDZ🥲🥲🥲
1:24 Chunks must add humor to everything 😂
I ❤️ you Kenny ❤❤❤
I know I'm a year late! As an American, I'd like to apologize on behalf of the fucking idiots who said Kenny didn't win that first fight. Bullshit. He won fair and square! And the 2nd fight was even better and he kicked ass as well!!! I love Kenny. His brother is an AWESOME coach and his little baby brother is so cute. I love how those brothers love each other. That's true family. <3 Makes me more proud of my own 3 sons. =)  GO KING KENNY!!
you beta squad 😊
King means Kenny and Kenny means King
Can't believe I'm only seeing this now
Whos here in 2000??
King Kenny 🔥🔥🔥
20:52  sharky & aj made me cry men
This is Truly inspirational ❤
almost started bawling his friends and family talking about how happy they were
Truly a motivational and an inspirational story. You deserved king
King. Those qho keep saying he lost..they dont know what thwir talking about
Movie of that year
Kenny your the best boxer in the world
Wow
F*** Faze
No joke i cried
So black people do get broken noses! Sorry, Kenny, love you! But darker skinned people say they don’t get broken noses! And you even said it (someone from Beta Squad did) in one of your videos
👑👑👑
Absolutely Beautiful ❤ Inspirational  Love it 💗
❤
King Kenny/Beta Squad don't let anyone steal your highs! Love this doco great role models.

Man Kenny’s little brother wisdom looks like Tyler the creator! Wouldn’t be surprised if they did an ancestry and were related! They are Nigerian so it would make sense
Beta has always had my respect. As a group of friends, creators, businessmen… just overall real guys
Chills
This Seeme Like it was Brothers Vs Friends.W Beta Squad
As I watch this video full of emotions. I can honestly say I have so much respect for you, Kenny. I see nothing but great things in your future. #TeamBetaSquad #TeamKingKenny
What a video 🔥
Loved this soo much ❤️I'm so proud of you
Loved this soo much ❤I'm so proud of you.

Why would ppl hate on kenny
YES KING KENNY
this is seriously well edited, and great quality content!
Soo proud of our king Kenny 🫶🏻❤️
THAT SCENE WHEN SENSEI AND KENNY WERE ABOUT TO FIGHT. KENNY IS LIKE MIKE TYSON #2 WITH THE DEADLY EYES FOLLOWING HIM. WOW!
What a movie 🔥
I’m a huge fan of beta squad and your boxing career & myself I’m half Australian half Algerian 🇩🇿  live in Melbourne also born in Australia 🇦🇺 🦘 please comeback down to visit. King Kenny you have got and gained heaps of respect ✊ from those with brains all the way down here in whoop whoop land down under 😂😂😂😂😂
You should vs ksi
just watched and know about this just right now, congrats man!
Great documentary, Its more of a movie, the video is really, really good, the fight is bullshit tho, Kenny won that, KING Kenny!! ❤
I really love this 👏❤️ I cried watching this 😭👏👏
So proud of u Kenny this was amazing this made me cry sm
wow how time flies, i first seen your videos when you were doing those videos with your little brother and now you're doing all of this stuff, proud of you!
King kenny CONGRATSSSS❤️
I saw on Reddit all that hate from a year ago and these guys are so stupid. FaZe Temper and Sensei both lost. I want Kenny to fight outside of the uk to prove these guys wrong
fire 🔥🔥🔥
My respect for Kenny after watching this 📈
this guy is a legend
The judges couldn’t do their job because they were in dangerous circumstances????BULLSHIT😂Someone has to look for that envelope given to them by faze 😂
This deserves to be on a paid platform
I actually cried
Bro that fight was crazy
Honestly kenny was doubting himself and temper had to just bring him more down by shiting on him when literally kenny is tryna understand because hes believed he won until he seen the internet. And kenny decided since temper wouldnt fight, him and sensi would fight and sensi was far more respectful and understanding
the only thing betta sqaud is good at is rigging fights
we all are so proud man, this was so inspirational keep up the good work ❤
Kenny the Goat absolute goat
LOVE THIS!!
20:41 who knew they these two are gonna fight now
Beta squad is friendship.
Easily best youtube video ever 🥹

You can be the next best thing just dont give up you have alot of supporters ✨️ well done to your brother 👏🏼 he has done a lot for you and hasnt give up on you that isnt a good brother thats the best brother you can have to stick with you in your journey ❤️
Still renember when his brother bought like 250K robux with his money. Time goes by fast
when will u upload again
Kenny can you do more wisdom pranks
kenny doesn't deserve all the hate by the interment and especially by FaZe And btw ur brother (Wisdom) has grown so much and so have you just remembering the past when u used to pull pranks on him and he used to throw a tantrum and now Ur WINNIG FIGHTS LEFT AND RIGHT and ur brother is proud of you now to see this is life changing Good job and btw FaZe group is just being bias
IKKK rlly late but happy birthday kenny (for today) have an amazing day also we are all so round of you!!!
I’m so happy for u great job
Happy Birthday Kenny
Some are saying  faze vs Kenny is robbery but its not a robbery Everybody saying that the match is robbery because faze clan is more known but yeah temper gave some fist to Kenny. Kenny  also have great round 2 3 5 (I am a beta squad fan so don't get replay that HE IS A BETA SQUAD FAN THAT'S WHY THAT HE IS SAYING THE MATCH IS NOT ROBBERY.
You look good in the ring, man. Congrats, Kenny.
Kenny, Are You Still Here, Please Speak to Me and Give me a Chance and Reply to Me Please?
This should be on netflix. kenny won both imo
hi king kenny

Yo Kingkennytv you barely post now I mist the old you man🥹🥹
New favourite movie fr
Welcome baxk
This was amazing Kenny ! Your spiritual, physical and mental growth is a beautiful journey and there’s  more to come 🙏
This is a super insipirational movie which tells everyone theat when your determined you pracxtice and NEVER GIVE UP you can achive anything, Kenny is such an inspirational person to me. Also I think that it is extremely disrespectful to ruin Kennys big moments because with the work and effort he put in for this he deserves to be proud of himself. And especially one of my absolute favourite youtubers 🤩Thank you King Kenny  Keep up the amazing work Never give up and always be proud of your victorys no matter what the support of your friends and fans is bigger than the hate of any haters! ❤
Are You Coming Back?
If you miss the old Kenny who used to prank his brother all the time..😔  👇
Kenny always brings a smile on my face
Truly so proud of you! This was an amazing documentary on your journey 🙏🏼❤️
King Kenny can you upload like did with your brother
YOU DESERVE EVERYTHING!
Kenny **** those ******* keep going!
Betasquad way better than faze clan😌
This feels like a movie that belongs in theaters, but not just in theaters, but Blu-Ray and DVD as well. Love this documentary man! It is an inspirational story done right, from his fight with Faze Temperrr to his title win against Faze Sensei and along the way, we see controversy be a permanent part in this story and it plays out really well to perfection! I have been a fan of your videos since you been doing Fortnite, and you were one of the only Fortnite YouTubers I can actually get behind heavily especially since the involvement of your brother Wisdom who to my delight, is in the documentary. Cannot wait to see your next boxing match when it comes out on YouTube! I give it a flatout 10 out of 10!
This is inspirational 👏  Thank you for sharing your journey with us.
King!
Fight salt papi 🙏🏼
kenny you goat
BIG RESPECT KING KENNY🔥
He beat temper
Wow felt like a movie/documentary. From being a prank YouTuber to this, insane
u know malek hamdaoui he is my teacher
I miss u bro Fr Fr
OMG this was so confusing but always proud of u King Kenny.Let the haters talk...❤
Lmao love the doc and the hard work but broo that's 2 whole robberies....
You rigged both faze fights
Hello king kenny I’m trying to find a clip from one of your old videos ( wtf are you doing In my fridge?) do you know where I can find that clip pleaee?
I've been following BetaSquad for months but this is the first time I've gone to your channel ... you rock!
Hi
Btw kenny I’m a fan and want to box when I’m older u inspire me and just keep on following your dreams if ur on the floor get up if ur losing fight if ur life depends on it
Only just watched this amazing to see the journey 🙌even though I disagree with the Sensei fights still you can see the time, effort and dedication. All respect Kenny
You know what is crazy after the fight only faze members said faze temper should have won
Well done Kenny!!! 👏
Fantastic video gives a great insight of what fighters have to go through 👊🏻❤️
Imagine Niko vs Banks and Sharky vs Jarvis Chuncks Vs Kay
Kenny should not have won yes he was the  underdog and yes it was a feel good moment but faze temperr have better punches no hate this is a good documentary but I feel like that was a robbery if you look at the first match you can clearly see temperr having better punches punches that connect equal points same thing with faze sensei I feel like beta squad was the judges 😂 like for real he was even surprised that he won
this was very inspirational man love it
I’m proud of you 👏 Kenny legend from somalia ❤
In my heart u are 2-0
Ngl I thought he lost both fights
Dang bro i started watching this when he was pulling old pranks on his little brother and I'm glad he hasn't changed since then, 5 years later i came back to see kenny is boxing.
I actually cried when Kenny won I was so happy
Kenny Kenny Kenny HEAR ME OUT   You vs saltpapi
love this so much. so proud of u kenny the dedication and hard work is honestly so inspiring 💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
44:16 umm Is temper tough
KING KENNY 🤴 ❤ !!!
love the clip of keemstar being a clown and making out that kennies wrongly judged win would be the end of beta squad. what a weirdo
C,mon
Bruh ends up winning the other on two
Very good video good documentary. But he lost his two first fight in my opinion
I’m just getting around to watching this, and I regret not watching it sooner. The inspiration this brings is crazy and brought tears to my eyes
Come on King Kenny❤❤❤❤show love
No one can question the King's work, but in my opinion he still lost both of his fights. However he still put up a amazing performance, showed incredible heart and I definitely wouldn't want to be in the ring with that warrior. 👑👑👑
This was one of the most amazing videos I have watched on Youtube. It was 44 minutes and somehow it kept my attention throughout the entire thing, I did not move or take my eyes off of the screen. amazing stuff.
You lost 2 both fights let’s be real.
i think its time for a pfp change kenny
Do you win
I’m gonna sound like a hater but sensei barley sparred for this fight so if he had a proper real training camp this fight would’ve been way different
Temper vs Kenny was close but temper was robbed
Bro them haters can stfu cuz Kenny u deserved that win and u worked hard for it so haters.....U jus keep hating
i’m so proud of you kenny💪❤
Kenny Won that I just think people are fake
Kenny barely got this win he was almost knocked out 2times but he got lucky first one would of been in the first round.
10-10 first round was a joke 😂 it was a 10-9 and arguably a 10-8 to sensei, UK judges 😂
Wow faze clan are sooks
Wait  i think Kenny teach me at unitas
Keep going man you’re the best❤❤❤❤
such a touching story.. your friends and family should be proud of you, how far you've come. Respect to you x
Aye kenny v kenny let's make it happen don't back out
Congrats
bro yt commented W and Kenny is the strongest in the beta squad
They just mad they lost 😂😂😂
faze won twice kennys whole team is full of bs telling him he won when he clearly lost those two fights.
W  for king kenny and his W BROTHER
This is the best YouTube video ever . Love you Kenny so much 🫶🏽🫶🏽🫶🏽
Bro went from making fortnite pranks to this💀
I don't get why people were hating on him it was a close fight he trained super hard for this fight just for him to win and soon after people are saying he didn't win like it's stupid
dude literally built faze and kenny told him he didn't know who he was 💀
When I heard wisdom talking,I realised how much kenny inspires people and how much he worked
Mastermind Robbery
I wanna see king kenny fight dat dean guy from USA 💭 he is  2-0  too!! I think dat would be a facking amazing fight. #King’sAreKings
<3
this motivates me..... king kenny FOR LIFE........
Not me crying from happiness that he won even though i don’t know him in real life but i am still proud. And this video literally gave my motivation to start sport again🫶🏼
1st Round! W!
Great documentary. Unreal
You lost bro accept it like a man
❤
Robbery
This is wordless! Fu**ing beast!
King Kenny !!!
Please return
How does Kenny have no body hair
Wowe
Boo 👎  boooo👿 boooooo🤬 boooooooo😾 boooooooooo👺
I hate kenny
The emotion and cinematic in this is incredible the emotion was soo raw and heartfelt even I got emotional ngl. I’m soo incredibly proud of sensei he continues to do us all proud no matter what and the fact that he beat sensei who has more experience then he does just goes to show that experience doesn’t mean shit it’s rlly about ur effort and determination and anyone else that Kenny faces in future is gonna be light work for him ❤️❤️.i loved everything about this I don’t know what I would if I had to deal with the internet controversy that Kenny faced the internet is soo toxic ppl just couldn’t accept his win man how sad is that. That’s how u know Kenny is doing amazing I have soo much respect ✊🏽 for u I can’t wait to see u achieve more and get more wins u have a future in this for sure. Wisdom is really lucky to have a brother like u
Can’t wait to see Kenny’s next fight
Kenny is such an inspiration and a superstar he is amazing just a little more training then you could go pro
You should try and take down all the faze members, try K and Faze Adapt them two are easy fights
kenny u deserved this win idec u won fair and sqaure
Woah tyler the creator never knew u were into that
Kenny what happened to that Anastasia bird you met on Fortnite you should do another vid with her
King Kenny comeback please😢
Now say who really won
faze sensei shouldve won
I’m halfway in and it’s amazing so far. Nice work 🎉
bro is the world’s biggest robber
Faze sensei is the Man
if anything it was a draw but in no way kenny won that im sorry but no way
why were they gassing him up for recovering after the punch like he wasnt saved by the ref 😂
you lost dog in my humble opinion but i mean life isnt fair
Faze won tho …
Your nickname should be the Faze killer
Prank war 2
Super inspirational to go for whatever you place your mind on is highly achievable  You are so determined, desciplined and dedicated The quality is crazy, this is a whole movie All the best with your future matches. "W" All the way
Super inspirational to go for whatever you place your mind on is highly achievable  You are so determined, desciplined and dedicated The quality is crazy, this is a whole movie All the best with your future matches. "W" All the way
This is quality movie content🔥 I'm super proud of you Kenny❤️ All the best with your future matches 🙏
All hail King Kenny🥺❤️✊️
Kenny your amazing. People don't understand boxing is not only about physical strength it's mentally and emotionally. Kenny is a perfect example of cool, calm and collective. Your a strong man your a fearless fellow. Your amazing Kenny and super proud can't wait for your fight in November
Gotta give respect to Kenny but he lost that fight
kenny W like always
Keep Goin!!!!!!!!!!!
Does wisdom still have a channel?
I cant' believe where he is now.This channel is my childhood I been watching when I was 7 years old and his little brother have grown too.Oh I missed the old them.
So inspirational 🥺🇰🇪❤
Cmon daddy beta
You are the best don’t care about anyone ho is saying you lost
Still didn't win thought
This is the most inspiring video I have watched
bro rigged another fight lmao everyone knows its 2-0 to faze
Lovely
Faze Sensai was the winner Kenny literally pays these judges off it’s ridiculous
Nah Kenny made respect for you!! You beat someone who eveyone was afraid of!! Bro you deserve that!
there wasnt even a knock out to base a rigged claim like flake pauls rigged fights
So proud of you
First time watching this and I'm in so much tears. Big inspiration bro🙏🏾
This was great! I've gotten so annoyed with people saying the fights were rigged. They can have their opinion on who they think won, but to imply you didn't truly put in the effort is so disrespectful. You worked hard, and you earned your spot.
Follow God
Tobi is a USELESS host-PART-2 https://youtu.be/Ha58C6y4d8A proof
Garbage
Even though this shows how much work you put in it does not make my judgement of that sensei won that fight but I guess this is how it can be deflected
Kenny vs Idubbbz. The loser faces Temper when he returns.
UK alwayse winss
idc what u all think kenny deserved both wins
Everyone in the comments switched up sensei won delete this horrible docu
the best thing I've watched all month, a wholesome and inspirational journey, a must-watch!
you lost
im so happy that king kenny won and i saw how happy he was great job kenny and i studyed all the rounds and it was you that won great job
Robbed sensei
Damn Wisdom has grown
I thought you won both fights. Great video, very well edited
Abeg deck that temper guy in the rematch 😭😭 like proper decking
Mad motivational!!
Beta square be the best ... Don't listen to negativity Kenny, they just mad u doing good
Cool abt this super inspirational and all but sensei won regardless both worked hard but if im right sensei worked harder bro , just a fact and the best part is when the appeal got rejected mainly with the reason such as "kenny had the center of the ring" bs .......
I love you sm fam loved your content for ages but it’s sad to see you not recognise you lost… like yeah your the winner  you got the W but anyone with a brain can see who the better fighter was that night I lost a lot of respect for ya can’t lie brodie :/
hi
You can win a fight off two good moments tho, especially when barely anything significant was coming back the other way 🤷🏽
You lost fr fr
King 👑 kenny! ❤️
King Kenny is such a humble dude you can't help but go for this guy
W
When I Saw Wisdom I was like nah bro that’s another brother that they his wisdom grower so much
Crazy how there saying all this knowing both of his fights have been robbery lmao, if u truly believe he won your delusional honestly. Man so happy he got to rigged wins. I’m not saying he ain’t put in the work I’m just saying don’t walk around like you won.
big ups bro... love you no matter what man.. we both kennys from nigeria... love ya my g
Bro I box and study boxing you were in amazing shape and boxed well but idk what fight the judges were watching. Saying we don’t know what we are talking about. He didn’t have just two moment he won round 1 and 3 easily without question. Round two I was thinking draw leaning kenny and 4 I was thinking draw leaning faze. How has any judge scored that kenny winning by two points. A draw I could understand and have my own opinion but kenny winning by two. That’s mental scoring.
This is amazing 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 Go KING KENNY👑  A WINNER! A FIGHTER!
Yes!!!!! Kenny
Go King Kenny!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I watched Kenny Since I was a kid and I remembered him doing McDonalds and fake Lamborghini pranks on his little brother but the fact that he has come to this, man it's just insane.
I don't watch documentaries, but this was worth every second. The emotions and motivation in every bit of it are appalling. Congrats King Kenny. You deserve the win for your Hardwork. And Your Friends? This is what Friendship looks like.
0 - 2 🤣🤣🤣
I think every youtuber needs to post a video like this after their fight .
Much respect 👏🏾

Respect to Kenny amazing progress wisdom is going to be Kenny jr train him hard✅👏👏
Temper watchin this rn: 😡👄😡
I’m proud of you kenny 10/10 effort
🔥🏆
For those who are really fans of boxing you know sensei won. Why else would they be waiting on commission statement
I respect Kenny’s work, but sensei for sure was robbed
No disrespect but sensei won that fight, i dont even watch nor care about faze but sensei got robbed
Kenny the moment you looked shocked when your arm got raised, all the credibility of this win was lost.. pathetic
You got rocked in round one and sensei was about to finish you off until the red saved you and you know it too well.
I honestly Have respect For Kenny this Guy Raised Me when I was 11 and that was 2017 now am 16 Kenny and I look at ur channel And I smile When I see u upload Ur First Fight I was pissed when u lost But Ur second Was Better then I expected Idc if people say it’s rigged u Definitely Deserved that win 🏆 Love u Kenny Bye 👋
King Kenny vs Salt papi
Kudos to kenny 💙💙💙 A true hero anyone can look up to 💯💯
Kenny lost both fights lmao this shit rigged
you are such an inspiration, Kenny. Thank you for sharing your path with us 💛
I don't care what anybody  says . This man is talented . You deserve  the belt . Can't wait to see what you do next... above all you get the ICB YouTube ranking cause you are that good.
LLLLLLLL
i feel like he lost to sensei but he seems like a great guy, i really hope he gets a win with no controversy next - I'm sure he can get it, since he'll just keep getting better
sensei got robbed he destroyed u lol
The deception is real. He chose every angle that made him look good and kenny cut out all of the sensei strikes. We all know what happened the full fights on dazn yt
Still rigged both fights
Did the judges just releasee Ocean’s 14? Because this has been the biggest robbery broadcast to a television screen.
U didn’t win

respect kenny, unfortunately sensei won that fight.
L
Family friendly PG clean
Is it just me that thought kenny was chris eubanks son/ nephew and they were somewhat related... lool then to find out he knew nothin about boxing yet his bro is his coach is jokes.. love it though no hate only appreciation. He deserves every bit of those wins!
Respect, what deadication we love an underdog... King Kenny! NDL all the way!!!!! ..love this documentary editing everything on point.. want more!
:)
never give up kenny
U lost i don’t care what the score card say but I respect u getting in there putting on a show but you know u lost
KingRobberyTv
LETS GO KENNY BIG UPPPPPP
Amazing documentary
❤❤❤❤❤❤ proud of u Kenny!!!
You would earn more respect if you accepted you lost
W youtube boxing
Soo proud of Kenny. He still did really good even if Sensei won.
Been watching you and beta squad for awhile now, but your journey is one that many don’t know. Keep thriving and doing big things man. You deserve all the respect in the world. Big Ups fam
you def lost that fight but respect to you.
Biggest Robbery In Youtube Boxing History!!
W Kenny
I’m proud bro your a legend
#kenvjarvis
Ken v jarvis
great job fella
Sensei is an honorable honest man
this is beautiful, congrats kenny. i am inspired
Everyone congratulating you for a rigged fight is funny
But you still lost 🥱
can’t understand how he accepts another rigged win 😭😭😭
Please upload more I miss you😭
theres no way you won that
Brainwashing in plain sight 🤣 he lost
I 100% Thought that it was gonna be a draw  but i was so happy for you when you won kenny
Faze lost two times against one person from beta squad they might as well stop
Rigggeeeeedddddddddd sensei ate you like breakfast but you paid the judges
This had me at the edge of my damn seat the whole time. What work and dedication it took. Incredibly hardworking and humble to the core. Also the way it was documented and edited was awesome. Congratulations 🎉
Why did ref stop faze sensei from whoopin dat ass??
Faze won Ibsr
this is a whole movie, super inspirational
He won clearly
i strongly disagree
This is beautiful
How much do you pay the officials?
Truly inspirational. What a goat! I believed in you!
As a faze fan, it’s amazing to hear what the other side has to say, it’s great. Love and respect to all the beta squad
Sensei is an awesome support in that moment you deserved your win both times tempa is just a sook lmao
You deserve it all Kenny you legend
16:00
this deserves to be viral you worked for it
Yeah nah you lost clearly bro
i smell a temper v kenny 2
Who's next salt papi? Or ksi either will be the only people Kenny will call out or even maybe jake Paul
Best video I’ve ever watched❤️‍🔥
You are delusional about your fights. You have benefitted from 2 shoddy decisions and the people around you aren't being honest with you. It's not intentional, they are unconsciously biased to you. As a result, you are lying to yourself to maintain the illusion that you won. In the eyes of most observers, you are the clear loser of those both fights. I believe that, deep down, you agree. You releasing this documentary to try and sway people is evidence to your insecurity. Please, just be real with the fans and yourself. You lost.
From making fortnite videos with his little brother to winning in the 02 arena against an opponent with 10 years of experience
the song make it even beater
🤡
You lost
You lost both matches. Especially the temper fight. It wasn't even close. The sensei fight was way closer but you lost that too. All your friends and family are obviously going to be super biased toward you, but the rest of the world isn't. You even said your supporters were saying you shouldn't have won. You lost both fights and the judges definitely scored in your favor due to home field advantage. It's bullshit. Sensei doesn't care so he probably won't appeal, but that was another robbery. You're a great boxer, don't get me wrong. Especially for the short time you've been training.
This guy can’t handle the fact he lost finding an excuse
Netflix should buy this
Next fight faze Jarvis or rematch Kenny and beat him brutally
MOVIE
Ok but it's not fair to sensei
i cried two fucking times
I loved this video so much. Thanks KingKenny you have done your country proud. What a legend. Keep up the work
Both of the flights were a tie
More like princess Kenny you robbed him 😤😺
King Kenny is actually trash
Is this Kenny doing an American accent?
I always begin my essays with this same intro 😂
So we just going to forget he robbed sensei? Even the commentators think the same
So inspiring I love you Kenny
Deji's face after winning is probably the face that makes me most glad
Yo get bradley involved
Kenny deserved this win, didn't realise the FaZe Clan was this dumb, atleast be a good loser. Unbelivably unfair.
is the coach his boold older brother or he just calls him a brother in like a homie way
Love kenny, Sensei definitely won the fight tho, robbed again
Incredible fight but u didn’t win
KENNNNNNNYYYYYYYYYYYYY
I’m so proud of you! You deserve every accolade!!
he kicked your ass high key but you still did great
Lenny can never win a fight for real. He can just win because of the rigged judges.
12:20
I want a comment that has more replies than youtubes
What a documentary. So inspiring man. CONGRATULATIONS KENNY!
YESSS! KING KENNY THE LEGEND IS BACK AND WON!.
This made my day
Mans called wisdom 😂😂😂
Not gonna lie I have a ton of respect for Kenny as a boxer and he’s easily one of the best in the scene but a lot of this video felt like coping for what where obvious losses based on how boxing is scored.
Nice
We need a chunkz v kenny rematch
love this proud of you brother
You did a good job 👏🏼
Keep going pal
the truth is you stole the lime light AGAIN. It should be you putting in the appeal not sensie.
King Kenny, you’ve inspired me that anything is possible if you work for it thank you.
King kenny vs slim next
Thank you kenny for this inspiration
0-2
A like and a new sub. I love this type of videos im a sports fan so thank you
Kenny bro u are a proper gangsta., I am 43 yrs old & this is my sons account but I love the effort & sincerity u show, wish u all the best & know u will succeed in everything u do
This needs more views.
Yeah he deserved that
Is this Jidion doing the voice over
I still think it was a draw
W FaZe Sensai L FaZe Temperr
Pls make more of these, it allows people to see what goes on behind the scenes instead of what comes to the audiences first impression
Respect! 🗿🔱
bro ur 0-2 against faze now wym 1-1😭
Bro when is this fight gonna be overturned
You did great
Sense I won the fight fair and square it could not have been a draw because the fight was one sided. Kenny didn’t do a thing in the fight. They couldn’t even find good highlights for him. Props for getting in the ring and putting in the work but he lost again and again they’re trying to get him to be the winner. Something is weird right about now. 2 fights in a row of the same bs. I think the best thing Kenny can do is own up to the fact that he did not win the fight and give his opponent the respect he deserves
Bruh they really robbed Sensei so this dude wouldn't be 0-2 after making this corny crap.
This fight was a draw to me and a lot closer then people think, but everyone  on the internet knows boxing apparently 😅
Love Kenny, as a sensi fan…..but ….run it back
You tried your best the results weren’t there, but big props for even stepping in the ring. Go at faze Jarvis now
the people know sensei won so whatever bullshit the commision says to cover up this shit show is pointless
this needs more attention imo
0:56 I love Kenny but dude how do you now know temperrr 😭 he’s literally god father of faze
A fucking beast I have been watching for years
Nah you lost. Rigged again. 10-10 draw first round? Lmfao what a joke.
I remember when Lenny bullied his little brother lol
He deffo lost both fights but fair play
so proud of u kenny! unbelievably inspirational, you should be so so proud of urself x
Someone gave the first round a 10-10 gtfo 😂. If the first round is given a 10-9 then it should atleast be a draw.
Production level of this is insane.
Yoooo I’m gassed so he actually fucking won. Yessssssss
Legendary video, top 10 yt films I watched oat, got to give huge props to not only your coach, but your Brother!
Kenny won idc what anyone says
33:00
If kenny gets robbed, AGAIN with a overturn, that would just be mad and in a bad way.
You lost
Lost
I used to work with Kenny at Asda Watford nice guy but this is all bollocks..
Hey i just wanna say that GOD loved the world so much he sent his only begotten son Jesus to die a brutal death for us so that we can have eternal life and we can all accept this amazing gift this by simply believing in him (Jesus).  Ty for reading
Straight goosebumps 🔥
Why am I crying??? 😭😭😭
This is giving Rocky Balboa vibes😷😭🏆🏆🏆🐐🐐🐐
Kenny you should fight Faze jarvis it would be good match!
🔥🔥🔥😷My eyes got teary @ 40.14, ⚡🔥this is soooo inspirational 🚀💪🏽🏆SO King Kenny!!!!🐐🐐
Congratulations! You deserved the win, ignore the haters 🙌
Undoubtedly, the 2nd fight was Kenny's moment and nobody can take it away from him
no hate. you didn’t win that night bro. nor did you lose… but hey bro they robbed sensi lmao
❤️🏎️
I always believed in you
ROBBERY ABSOLUTE ROBBERY
❤️❤️❤️ very emotional 🥹  Very proud of you man
Come to the states and win here. Ksi did that and he earned universal respect. That would earn you the respect you try to demand. You say you’re a real fighter. You say you’re confident you can beat anyone, but you refuse to fight in a place where the judges aren’t on your side. Gib, Ksi, Slim, etc would fight anyone anywhere. I like you. I want to see you ko someone and put the critics to shame.
This a movie. Big ups Kenny🤩
Kenny i love u but u didnt win, ive seen other ways i could judge the fight but there was no way i could give u the win
I love Kenny , but he ain all that bro , he ain all that of a boxer he clearly lost the sensie fight , he 0-2 , but againist good boxers
You did not win that fight. No matter what you say. You did not win
pay the refs 2 times thats sad
Kenny stfu you won🔥 it’s all the haters. Kenny we love you!!!!
I dont care what people say. Kenny won and thats final.
W documentary, production quality's elite 👌🏾 I'm kinda surprised by the decision, but it doesn't matter, hopefully next fight nothing will be left to the judges 💪🏾
And old faze solos Beta squad
0:57 that’s cap temper used to be huge
Niko needs to box
Robbed
Who you keep paying to announce your victories?
Wing Wenny
i was here before he changed the title
BIG UP KING KENNY  👑
Chunks should box
Rigged as hell
Kenny, I don't know if you will read this comment, but if you do then please continue your grind to become the best youtube boxer. You have made me a fan of boxing. You are an inspiration. They should never have taken away the first victory against Faze Clan, because they were just salty that Temperr didn't win. You are a fucking legend. Congrats on the win. Now it is the time to take on Alex Wassabi or Slim. Can't wait to see you in the ring again. Legendary documentary!!!
Loser documentary
🔥🔥🔥
Take on salt papi
How did they rob temper he got knocked out
respect💪
Uk on Top🇬🇧🇬🇧
cool, u still lost lol
Kenny. A true king. Can't wait to see who you fight next. Who ever it is, they should be scared of the man the myth the king KENNY. God bless and good luck with your future fights
Wow this is absolute fire Kenny !!!
Massive respect kenny you've come along way man respect❤️‍🔥
The truth is Faze was robbed, He outboxed you Kenny as much as i like you you never won the fight man.
I don’t know why the ref bailed Kenny out with that standing 8 count. Like why the fuck would you stop a boxing match when someone gets rocked… sensei could’ve and would’ve finished him round 1.
Lol robbed Faze Senei and acting all oblivious to the fact hahaha lucky Sensei just a humble guy
4 years ago I never thought Kenny would do boxing in the future, truly a legend.
Sensei was robbed
GOOD ON YOU FOR WORKING HARD! But you lost that fight.. But still Respect to you Kenny! 💯
Kenny got sum long ahh arms
WENNY
Change the title too The riggedness behind Kenny vs faze sensei
This was sick well done to everyone who made and edited this video and congrats to Kenny bro you put on a show 💯
Sensei vs Kenny was the best fight technically by far, and I can't believe the robbery that went down. Kenny lost the fight convincingly, but has now won twice without actually being the rightful winner.  Kenny keeps celebrating fake wins, it's sad. Realise that you didn't win, how can you expect to improve if you think you won, when you actually didn't?
This should tell you, you should never give up ☺
To be honest this is one of the best 44mins in my life
Honestly i think king kenny deserved to win he won the first one people hated on him ,he won the second one they hated but didn't succeed like the first time .  King kenny well done and keep going we are behind you god bless😉🙏🏾
Love you Kenny but fuck these judges man
24s hat too Wavey
wowww, this has inspired me
Both fights were well deserved 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿 well done King Kenny 👑❤️❤️
FaZe salty🧂
His team are full of YES men. You need a new circle.
He robbed temper and sensei
The title and thumbnail changed. Lol. It used to be "The Truth Behind Beta Squad vs Faze Clan". Edit: They changed it back to its original title. Lol.
robbed
changed the title
you did great, but you lost im sorry
Close fight but kenny deserved the win
U did all this just to lose the fight u need to come forward and admit u lost the fight! Or ur just playing into the corruption of British boxing.
This was crazy good
Phenomenal video. So Proud of all the boys who won! big Dubs.
Not A Robbery... Ypu Won Kenny!!!
production value was exquisite
Kenny you won both of your fights no one got robbed bro Like wtf🐐🐐
Great video now since you and temper are 1-1 run it back and see who comes out on top misfits 2
RESPECT ❤
brought tears to my eyes it shows if you put your mind to anything you can do it.
Karma caught up to temper 😂😂😂😂
Congrats❤️👏👏👏👏
Proud of you. 👏
You still lost LOL
Faze got robbed bra
Proud 2 see Kenny go from making a diss track about little bro 2 fighting on the big stage
You lost, and the ndl aren't to be trusted. BIG L
this is a whole movie, super inspirational 🔥
You lost bro cmon
This is so inspirational!!!
You lost lenny🐵
With respect, Kenny did insanely well against Sensei but I think Sensei got robbed of the win again
Very one sided opinions you don't need to know boxing to see sensei and temper won those fights
U lost both of your fights
Are kenny and daley half brothers cuz they look very different to eachother
We get no answer on "the truth", epic Transformers music in the backgroud and a man talking about himself in the 3rd person  . . . . . ..  .44min of cringe at its finest!  BTW a knockdown round is a 10 - 8! The boxing rules were not followed.
respect brother. ggs f the haters
Letsgooooo King Kenny! Inspiring af brother!
Sensei is my favorite fighter out here I’ve been supporting since he was in faze in 2015 but now that he is going to retire the mantle for now I gotta support the man that Sensei respects and that man is king kenny 🫡👑
W kenny you deserved it
Robbed both fights . I’m never watching a Kenny fight again. Robbery.
Can't wait for the next chapter for you kenny, CHAMP!
I don’t really even watch Kenny but this was such a good watch. Glad to see Kenny thrive
Quality of production is insane ! Congrats 🔥🔥
Sensei got robbed
Why did he do the narration in a american accent?
It's not over 🥊🥊🥊🐐
Cant hate on this guy man
I love you Kenny, I really do and I think you fought great and you’re genuinely one of the top yt boxers but sensei beat you in that fight
bruh
Good on you Kenny now I have to ask why did you post this? Are you gonna box again?
Big w for u Kenny. I'm so happy for you!
Dumb ass YouTube boxing has to be followed by a script 🤡🤡🤡
Rigged 😭😭😭
Kenny we love you, I was there in the o2 screaming honesty I’m proud of you forget what others say yes it was a close fight however the pba believe you won so congrats❤️
rigged
I thought kenny vs temper was closer than sensei vs kenny   i defo thought kenny won againts temper  However Sensei vs kenny was different, i thought sensei won, but they should of atleast put a tie  So i do believe sensei did get robbed  But i aint sum professonal so the pba and everyone else knows better, so congrats to kenny
KENNY WON ALL HIS FIGHTS IDGAF
I respect Kenny so much man. He NEVER ducked smoke, He WANTS to win, He WANTS to fight, and he’s not scared of ANYBODY in the scene. Keep working, keep grinding, and show everyone why you’re the 🐐
Let’s be honest kenny you did not win your fight
I was routing for Sensei, but my respect goes to you Kenny!
sounds like Lamont holt narrating lol
Can't believe this is the same guy who used to record fortnite videos with his brother
Respect 🫡
Enough to make a grown man cry
KENNY THE GOAT FR. Y’all gotta give bro his respect
This video is incredible. Kenny is a true King. What a legend.
👑
*“Who’s Been A TRUE FAN FOR OVER A YEAR”.🎂*
king kenny GG
Narrator like JEEN-YUHS
Why celebrate after that?
He’s full of shit
This was a good video but you didn’t win either fights looolllll
man i remember watching u doing prank wars with wisdom im so happy for you kenny🏹🙃
What I want to see is Kenny vs Chunkz
So when are you  fighting chunkz again to complete the circle ,Great job you did everyone proud
Beta squad robbed faze twice 😂
you are the most professional fighter in the yt scene u should go pro
No way that’s wisdom with that deep ass voice 🥲
! ! !
I just want u to know that u lost this fight and idk how dis refs do the voting thing but this is crazy 1,3 round ez sensei he scored a knockout and 2,4 he did better landed more punches so FaZe clan won 2 times and got robbed those 2 times
goosebumps, fr goosebumps
The bias in this video is crazy
This is the time for jarvis vs aj
Look at Kenny man. So inspirational!
AMAZING VIDEO can’t wait to see the temper vs kenny 2 rematch both 1 win 1 loss im sure so let’s go
Well done Kenny. Great vid, great prep work for the fight and congrats on the win. You made the UK proud
Love you kenny your awsome people who are saying that was rigged there just jealous
Jidion with the Voice Over? Common W
Faze 2 dubs u 0 faze got robbed agaib
Who’s shaking right now
Congratulations king wenny
It should have been a draw or a win for sensei
The intensity of emotion in this documentary was so powerful. The most incredible part of this entire experience is the determination you set as an inspiration to anyone, is greater then any win. You won one of the hardest battles anyone can face…DISCIPLINE.
Everyone who said Kenny won also said he won the first time. lol  How can ANYONE say the first round was a draw? One of the most respected fighters the UK said it was a rob lol.
Rigged
Faze sensei won ‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️
No hate but why tf is every damn youtuber turning into "boxers"
Is that Kenny Doing aAmerican accent
The judges are ruining his moment. If someone gives you a false win it’s worse than losing and it gives that person loads of hate.
🎥🎥🎥
Good documentary but LETTS BE REAL hes 0-2
Realistically Kenny is 2-0
It's so frustrating for people like kenny to work so hard and put on an amazing and proffesional performance and people who watch with no knowledge give him shit even though he won the fight and regardless whether you think it is a robbery or not he stood and according to the PBA won against the scariest man in the scene with less than 2 years experience. Absolute champion Kenny keep working.
Just came across your content like a week ago. But yoh! You are amazing. The commitment is something else... Especially after being used to you guys bring jokers
Double robbery
Dude made a whole movie for a fight that he actually lost not his fault though but if we want to be honest everyone knows that sensei won
You got a win you didn't deserve... FACT!!!
How is this not on Netflix ? How is this kind of video on YouTube ? And it’s free ?? Huge respect
I love temper and kenny but cos I love both idk what side?
@kingkennytv Won that fight fair and square it was close! But King Kenny won with the gab and more active! 🥊 💯  congratulations kenny!
“When temper sees my next match, he’s not going to want to rematch me again”. You sure as hell aren’t kidding. Why would he want to rematch you after another rigged outcome in your favour🤣🤣🤣🤣
rigged the fight with sensai he won
w
You a winner man keep boxing dont be demotivated keep beating faze
Sensei won . But u were great
I have no respect for Kenny and his coach after that absolute coping session at the end of the video the world knows the truth either way the pba probably doesn't want sensei to win because this might possibly be his last fight
Sick work Kenny! 👊🏾
I honestly love Kenny watched him for so long and to see the commitment this guy has done is so motivating to the younger audiences. RESPECT ✊
❤❤❤❤❤
40:42 kenny and deji r such a good duo
Faze Sensei Got Robbed bro
the truth he lost on 27th it was fk up score
I've never been interested in boxing, but this film is just incredible, I have to say.
You work hard for this Kenny weLL done on your dub
Kenny I’m sorry but u definitely lost
Sick! Content dont know how you edited this
u did soo great kenny. me and my entire family LOVE you and will support you till the end. Keep up the good work man <3
We love you king kenny😭
Let's Goo team Kenny
MB01EOPSRNFHZAB what is this
My 2 favourite Youtuber in the ring😍😍😍
44:00 no the issue is you wouldnt have had a standing 8 count if the ref didnt fuck up and pull sensei off of you. It wouldve been a first round KO.
kenny u deserved this. ur hard work payed off. forget the haters their jealous. keep doing what your doing
Goosebumps all the way through 🔥🔥🔥
bro wisdom greww...
sensei won that fight and its clear
Faze Sensei won.
That journey was some real shit!
sttfu u lost
Next fight Jarvis?
After the PBA publishing reasoning I can see he definitely won.
what a movie. kenny deserves this❤
proud of u king
You have put in the work you will definitely win one day KING Kenny. what a GOAT
Sensei got robbed 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️
This is the same guy who came up with ‘sloppy sec-uhnds'
You robbed faze for another win
You can tell how much effort and training he put into himself within a short span of time to bag this victory! Good job Kenny!
Kenny did nothing dont no how he won
I really hate how people are hating on him even though the judges decided not him..
AJ, Sharky, Chunkz: Beta Squad  Niko Omilana: Kenny's first subscriber  Niko is a menace 😂😂😂😂 #NDL
This a movie 🎥
After this I changed my thoughts, I have to tell my self not to judge a fight if you don't know boxing. Congratulations, Kenny the beta warrior.
where’s kenny little bro
As Much As I Love The UK And Beta Squad, Faze Sensei Was Absolutely Robbed. No Bias At All. Still Respect To Both Fighters, Fight Of The Night In My Opinion.
Yall can say what you want but I domr think Kenny list against Sensei because it you rewarch it Sensei was really good defensively but hw did very little offensively
Hey mad respect for this quality work! U got a new subscriber here! Fuck ksi jake all day
Im ngl aj does not belong in these type of vids
Watching it in 4 k makes it sick
This is insane man ngl
Give sensei his belt back you cheat
Such an inspirational video  Very proud of you Kenny  Keep up the hard work ❤️
Faze be doing everyone dirty, congratulations Kenny and thanks for showing the fight on YouTube, you won both based on the judges and the judges say who won, not kids.
From watching this guy playing fortnite with his brother 4-5 years ago to watching him in boxing this man is 🐐
That fight was still rigged so doesn't matter
how is the boxing coach his blood brother? i dont get it
Add slim to add squad 😂😂
You lost my boy give it up
amazing!!!
Can we all agree this video would be excellent if he actually won lmao
Respect to you bro, but you didn't win the fight.
This would have been a good video if you actually won kenny
A second robbing 😂😂😂
Niko chunkz filly and aj were excellent judges great job
41:20 Kenny you 100% won that fight, when you got rocked, u came back and landed jabs over and over again, which made you win every round or most, judges had so score you up because sensei couldnt get past ur jab and was on the backfoot not letting his hands go. DEFEND THAT BEAUTY OF A BELT,   YOU ARE THE FIRST INTERNATIONAL CRUSERWEIGHT CHAMPION.
When I saw people saying sensei won I was like no Kenny won because literally he kept hitting with Jab yeah it wasn’t big moments like sensei who did 2 big shots but it was the jab that kept landing and people don’t understand that that is what also helped you with the points some of these kids saying it was rigged don’t even take time to understand that one big hit don’t mean automatically sensei won like no literally Kenny recovered so fast and kept control you guys saw how he had the middle in control ????? Literally Kenny won fair and square
You lost the fight, why is it so hard to accept that you are the loser
Qmazihg
I love how that coach only defence is ahh its kids that dont know boxing lol theres grown men that have watched boxing for years, even fighters with experience said kenny lost lol
Judge #3 is the plant. He scored the first round 10-10 when Sensai scored a standing 8 and is the only judge to give round 3 to Kenny. SUS AF
Non of beta squad posted that he won. Non of them jumped into the ring and that’s because they had doubt and know he didn’t win.  Respect to him for training hard, but this fight wasn’t his to take and there is no shame in that because he took a hard fight.
Love this
You lost the fight. Clearly rigged.
Team beta 💚🤍
To be fair though after seeing Kenny’s next fight, I don’t think Temper wants to rematch him again
I'm sorry but you lost that fight. I don't care what they say. YOU LOST THAT FIGHT and everyone knows it. First off that fight was over round 1 if the ref didn't rip Sensai off of you for some reason. he literally stop Sensai from winning first round and kept you alive. But even with that you still lost by decision. Ridiculous but this is what happens with a babysitting commission. But it doesn't change the fact you did amazing against Sensai and looked good out there. But you lost that fight. And whoever is chopping it up to teenagers talkin is delusional. Even the commentators agreed and every single boxing expert/ combat sports expert agrees you lost. You really think they were going to admit they messed up judging your fight 2 times in a row? Na they doubled down to save their a. At least that's what I think. No other explanation for such an obvious misjudge.
I want kenny vs slim
Honestly, YouTube boxing is mad crazy but Kenny's awful decision winning makes it soo disgraceful to even watch. Man almost ruined the whole event for us in the arena but thankfully a real skilled boxer like deji brought happiness again.
Kenny I’m sorry but you lost that fight bro
Soooo useless. Lemme tell you something. You'll lose your next fights against people who don't care about you like that. Against ksi, saltpapi, Deji, Slim, weller you'll lose
Kenny
Kenny vs slim make it happen
King
These useless idiots are a disgrace. Kenny lost that fight period. Sensei is too nice, Kenny lost hands down. Why hasn't he made them overturn it
This is trash Bro. You know you deserved to lose. You didn't do shit apart from last 3 seconds. You'll never beat someone like KSI, Saltpapi, Slim, Deji
Disgraceful. Honestly sooo Disgraceful. The guy was trash. Sensei beat him. Why hasn't this been overturned
We love Betasquad. But we don't like this stupid thing you guys are doing. He lost the fight, Faze Sensei beat him. The ref shouldn't have let Sensei stop hitting Kenny, they'll beat him
Well put together production here fasho watched it through and through
daley is really a win in your corner! inspiration to watch him coach
both of your fights have been incredible. you've chosen to take the hardest fights Faze has to offer, and both times have been draws. yes your first fight went from a win to a loss, it should have been a draw from the start, there was no definitive winner, and the second fight was the exact same just less tiring for either of you and was a lot more professional
wow like seriously do u hear the sounds he makes when he hits I am impressed
People saying sensei won. A standing count doesn’t mean you win the round and so may not even be scored a 10-8 if the fighter comes back to dominate the round
And unfortunately sensei got robbed now. There is no two ways about it
Cool 😎
Tbh kenny can easily beat temperr. He should've easily beat him
Congrats
Did great bro been a fan, but I think faze got it
This was above and beyond Kenny. Congrats on everything you've accomplished bro
Faze Sensei got robbed
You lost.
Wenny
for real kenny looks like muhammad ali 🧐
Am 22 minutes into this and I will say… this is really good … a story well told
INSPIRATIONAL 🔥
42:05 Deji casually winning in the back
Proud of you Kenny
I watched this without knowing the PBA already posted about it 😭 lets fkn go!!!!
Another rigged fight
This is a proper proper movie.Goodluck in the rest of your boxing career and pray you maintain your belt🤲Fuck the hate man the controversies ain’t nothing don’t listen to them.Just keep going champ😮‍💨
The standing count ruined it for Kenny, you can see that kenny regained his stance before the ref grabbed sensei.
I had to go to dark web website to watch the match …😂from Uganda 🇺🇬… much love … glad the Betasquad got this W
kenny deserve every single win
Respect to you Kenny, I respect all the hard work u put into this and hope u win your fights in the future💪💪
Kenny so proud come on I wanna see u in more boxing events
7:09 is this where they shot the recent Sidemen sunday when they were sparring?
This was so well shot wow so proud of Kenny he’s come such a long way
no matter the decision of the fight, you have to acknowledge the work both these guys put in and how hard they trained. its not kenny's fault if u think sensei won
This Is so sick... totally shredded when the 2nd match came around. U looked amazing during the fight. Hell yeah
Kenny is mad underrated you know, not even 2 years and he went toe to toe with the only youtuber everyone would hesitate to call out. Hes definitely only going to get bettet
kenny got saved by that ref, if only temper had that same ref he wouldn't be a meme 😂
Respect!!
I’m so proud of you, you are a 🦁
Lmao these YouTubers really think they r real boxers
proud of you king 👑
L
An example of hard work and dedication. Congrats King Kenny!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You deserve nothing but RESPECT. All hail KING KENNY!!
Nahh this is bullshit you lost the fight. You can paint this picture all you want but sensie got robbed
great doc
Alright man, every fighters got a story. Some more entertaining than others.   You're privileged enough to make bank from the fight, make a documentary and have many supporters still. Admit you lost.  Sensei won cus you we're a step behind in iq the whole time and you probably sensed it.   Been there, just not on the big stage. Heal up that ego big man and use your brain more in your next one. You have to constantly doubt ur proficiency to get good.  In some fights you gotta fight using ur mind. Dont go on autopilot while your mind wanders why you're losing.  The jab isn't the most powerful weapon, your mind is.
It's a good thing that this Misfit event lot of knock out/quit Cuz we know UK judges biased af I still don't understand the judge on Deji Vs Wasabi and Kenny Vs Temper
But we all know that faze won the fight
16:59 don’t mind me jus wanna come back some latter time 👀🤣
This is so well done! Great story and great film. Director deserves a shout too. MF x Dazn should pay them to do a series like this for other fighters
Congratulations on stepping into the ring but it’s important to say the truth because when you look back at this fight you have to ask yourself if you truly won or not. Don’t worry about what others think. So with that, I’ll say what I think is the truth. It was a close fight but I’d give the slight edge to Sensei. Can’t wait look forward to your next fights.
Biggest robbery of all time
Man you lost to faze clan I was a subscriber of you and beta but you rigged so sorry to fans
Why not challenge yourself and go for slim instead
Loved this doc, HOWEVER, to watch this back and not see how sensei CLEARLY won or at least deserved a draw is blasphemous
Congratulations for the win and we waiting for you to get another wins
so inspirational
MAMBA MENTALITY
W
He deserves this🔥
respect but still think kenny lost the second fight, close but think sensei had the upper hand
U lost, coward for celebrating like that.. robbed the victory in the moment from 2 guys, something they will never get to experience. It’s not your fault it was rigged, but it is your fault u didn’t put on a winning performance
The ref robbed sensei of a tko when he got in the middle first round. Sensei should have won this fight. No doubt. Kenny you did good bud but you lost twice to faze. Even though sensei don’t care you lost
Them posting the score cards says nothing. The score cards were wrong 🤣. Sensei won the fight end of discussion.
I remember watching you when your brother used to prank you by buys a bunch of fidget spinners 👍
Kenny I rate you highly but I think you could of done ten times better
He has had 2 fights and lost both
Kenny you a legend dawg. This shit was so inspiring 🥇
🇵🇬🇵🇬🇵🇬🇵🇬🇵🇬🇵🇬🇵🇬🇵🇬🇵🇬
Sensei won that though
KING KENNNYYYY
Ksi Vs King
What a documentary kenny keep it up and hopefully u get ur revenge on temper
W Kenny, you proved them wrong ! Love you bro and keep up the boxing career <3
I got goosebumps watching this🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
Kenny got belt so he can hold to title Sensai was retiring this was rigged and staged ur video is staged but congrats all the fans saw a different fight u lost
So much love Kenny
I have some of that Blue stuff if you want it for a price
This is a movie , felt like a showtime series
I still think Kenny won the first one
Kenny’s first subscriber 😂
Kenny deserves a ton of respect for fighting the guy no one wanted to fight, and winning. All I wanna say is congrats Kenny. I’ve watched you for 5+ years and seeing your journey is INSANE!!!
One of the best videos I've ever seen💪🏼
W
You should take a tune up fight like idubbz or Alex wassabi
Temperrr is a FaZe OG I like beta squad but FaZe the fuck up
im crying rn we love u❤️
LOVE U KEENY DONT EVER GIVE UP. ❤️
You still lost the fight bro
sensei robbed
Good job keeny this is epic keep it up good job on the fight against seanzi kenny
Regardless of the outcome or what anyone says, no one can’t deny the amount of work Kenny put into boxing. Just the fight with Sensei made me appreciate Influencer Boxing because of how professional YouTubers can be in a ring. I hope these controversies doesn’t demotivate Kenny and I want to see him fight again. Congratulations on the victory
Kenny went from an underrated pranking YouTuber to a big YouTuber cause of him being apart of the Beta Squad
❤️❤️❤️
banger
Legendary moments!
You the best kenny! Keep working brother and don’t listen to the haters, they are always going to talk 💯
I knew Kenny won both fights honestly he should be 2-0
Nah you lost fav
Robbed
Its hard to take these shmucks serious LoL 😂🤣
idk but still robbed as hell
SHARKY YOU DONT LOOK SERIOUS
King Kenny! This is a masterpiece. Period. Your journey, hard work, dedication, improvement etc have not gone unnoticed by your fans and the fans of boxing. No one can take anything away from you! Give this man RESPECT! Keep doing you and keep winning!
aww i feel so bad for kenny everyone screaming faze was robbed but his victory is always robbed by everyone else’s opinions BUT KENNY U DID AMAZING AND WE’RE PROUD OF UUUUUU
Sensei won
Common Kenny W
Get in there King !!❤️✊🏽
U didn't win though Ur both fights is rigged They gave u the win but u lost brother u celebrate in the both fights like u won Like u celebrate like U actually won That's what we don't like about U know u didn't win in the both fights but u still celebrate like a idiot 😂 Love beta squad
No matter what people say no one else would be able to do what kenny did. Respect
Watched the whole thing , I’m so ready for the rematch 🔥🔥🔥 let’s go Kenny put faze temper-pedic too sleep !!!
it’s so funny to me that this is so serious but beta is still jokes. even in a serious docu they’re still cracking jokes and keep the spirit up
That shit was not a Draw ✍🏽 King Kenny was definitely more active and connected more hits in the last round
all these fights was for clickbait.. but it wont last for long
everyone better be putting respec on Kennys name he put the work in!
Well deserved Kenny. It’s so crazy to say I grew up watching your content, now look at you bro. Keep going up 🔥
Kenny’s a legend
Faze Sensei got robbed
Being honest the ref saved Kenny the fight in that first round he shouldn't have stepped in like that it was fair game
KENNY VS TEMPERRR 2 LETS GO
Sorry, you lose against sensei. It just too obvious
ok i’m ngl this is kinda sick
You lost bro
I RATE THIS!!!
Kenny robbed two fights so far niko is probably waffling to the judges lol
we are all so proud of you Kenny ❤️
Rigged fight u lost bro stfu
Ayo what’s this going on yt 💀 it should be on Netflix ffs. 😂 nah but on a real the second fight was close but clear that you won in my eyes icl
Respect. Thought he won against temper, but he lost against sensei.
u lost but i still love u
Saying kenny robbed sensei or temperr is really dumb to say in my opinion TBH. Both fights where so close, they could have gone either way.
Although I thought sensei was going to win, I respect that you were able to go against all odds and win by working day in and out wanting to prove people like me wrong. Nothing but respect ✊
Are you erasing comments that talk about how ocntroversial the win was? I thought there would be more
Undeserved win🤦‍♂️
Should be 2-0
CHAMP.. Wenny!!
31:15 that counter was nice from weji ngl
legend
Nice fight
Wing Wenny 🔥
Ksi has worked harder ngl
Cmon king you did a such a good job man I’m happy and proud you’re just the best❤️!
Kenny is a fucken amazing boxer and warrior, he definitely has that killer instinct but he just didn’t win this fight, a draw maybe but sensei took that fight man
Big respect to sensei what a guy he’s humble in victory and defeat but it’s clear to see in that fight kenny won, half these people talking shit don’t even know how boxing works lol
W
U lost flat out Just be honest bro take your second loss and come back better don’t let doubts be on your name be a man bro
The first fight Temperr won but the second fight idk you can say Kenny didn't if you actually watch every round u see Kenny jabbing every round sensei got 2 big shots and sat back
what video, got me emotional and shit
In not gonna lie,..I kinda start to see how biased Wade is... that boy screamed robbery both times..with passion... something doesn't feel right with that...  just like he didn't even reviewed the last card,but only dropped a video calling it... Sensei got robbed
This was an amazing video to watch the journey has been crazy for you to learn boxing in such a short time nothing but respect. BUT, as much as i appreciate you and don't want to take anything away from you from the fight between you and Sensei i truly believe Sensei won that fight. Its kinda bizarre how a standing 8 count has apparently 0 value how does that make any sense and i believe if you didn't get that standing 8 count it would've been a KO or a stoppage.
Sensei won 🏆
Deep down you know that sensi won that fight Thier is no way you won that, the judges can’t judge for shit
Chunkz vs Salt Papi!!!!!!! make it happennnn
Thats what i am saying, its unfair to give kenny hate because of the controversial decisions a jury makes. He wents in there against tough opponents and just fights so people need to calm down
W Kenny and W Sensei
You lost against FaZe sensei as well if you watch it you know you lost that fight! Lets be real Kenny I hope they appeal it and sensei gets the win he deserves
eeh i still think you lost
Lets just hope the American puppets one day understand that a standing 8 count doesn't say shit... and doesn't give someone a certain win!
Did they overturn the results yet? Kenny lost that second fight.  3-1 rounds.  I like Kenny more than Sensei if people are thinking I'm hating.   Just facts
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
I’m not crying, you are!! Well done!! 🥹
This video is so wholesome ❤️‍🔥. Welldone kenny
Ngl how tf was the 1st round not a 10-8 if the ref didn't step in you would've been knocked down. Respect for not picking the easy fights like JJ and deji tho.
Robbery at its finest
Wisdom is so much older than I remember. man, time goes by fast, i was 7 in my room watching kenny and wisdom playing fortnite, now kenny is a boxer, a very great boxer, and wisdom is 14-15. time goes by fast man.
honestly what a W video what a W guy
The ref fucked up though ngl
Less go kenny!🔥🔥
You lost the fight 0-2
How can the ref stop sensei in the first round and give u a standing count not be 10-8 sensei?? Doesnt make any sense the ref had to stop him from dropping you in round 1 and it doesnt count as a knockdown?
i really want to know what would have happened if the ref didnt get in btw sensei and kenny after that 1st rocked shot kenny got caught with. felt like the ref really bailed him out cuz sensei looked like he was gonna try n go in for the kill. guess well never know. shout out to kenny though for shaking off the cobwebs and getting the dub
🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡
10-10 in round one those judges must be high 🤣  KENNY THE ROBBER(btw I supported kenny)
you still lost
Sense I got robbed
LETS GO KENNY!
Kenny has balls of steel
I mean the second fight was also feeling a little riged e.g the first round. I thought it was draw.
Good shit Kenny much love from Canada.
crazy u lost
The amount of effort Kenny put into this is actually crazy this is one of the most motivational videos I have ever watched, going from watching him playing Fortnite with his brother 3 or 4 years go to this is absolutely insane
This video is a masterpiece much live king ❤️
You lost
This is just beautiful, you go Kenny👊
My man
Beta squad are number 1 and king kenny is my favourite one. Better then sidemen all day
Let’s go🤴🏾🔥
If you watched this without tearing up something must be wrong with you!!!!!! 🥺😭😭😭😭😭Proud of you King kenny🥺❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Its mad how Kenny went from loosing to Chunkz in a flippin youtube video to beating Faze Sensei one of the best Boxers in the scene 👏❤ well done bro 💯
sensei got robbed regardless i love beta squad but nah, kenny barely hit back .
kenny should fight temper again
🙌🙌🔥🔥🔥
Sensei was robbed
Yessir
both was clearly a loss to you clearly got battered something aint right here happened last time where it got appealed and will most likely happen again
ROBBERY
Sensei was robbed and no matter whose fan are you. There was no way kenny won. Hate if u want now
Keny 💪🏽
you still lost stop robbing people
fight again win convincingly sorry you went through this .
so proud u deserve it all
I want to see kenny v ksi
loved watching every second of this documentary 10/10
Yo this documentary is firee 🔥 good job kenny i had it a draw but those jabs that u kept hitting him with won u the fight congratulations
But Faze Sensi actually won ggs tho
Best movie I’ve EVER watched. Big up KING kenny 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
Kenny really put in all those ads cause he knew ppl were gonna watch👏🏾😂 but respect to him
Good job Kenny 😎👍🔥
I love it
One of the best videos I’ve watched as of late 👏
ive watched you since i was a wee boy but mate you lost that fight im sorry i respect u heavily as a fighter but you lost.
Sensei robbed
I thought it was a draw, but if the judges are 100% on their decision then noone can say a single thing
sensei robbed
respect to Kenny but also big respect to his blood brother Daley
You guys go from hating to supportive like please make it make sense
This was a close fight
Even keem try to turn it over Well that did not work for him 🤣🤣
Jarvis should’ve fought
I Kenny was controlling the ring but sesnsei scored more punches in round 1,3,4. Kenny was stamped in the middle of the ring but was barely active. Kenny imo won round 2. I don’t see him coming back in round 1 because sensei connects more punches towards the end of round 1.
This is sick 🔥🔥
Any other beta squad gna box
This was elite
Congrats habibi
Determination and discipline are the KEYE
You wanted to make the scores even again but you lost again.
bro u lost smh
The faze fans are being bias
41:20 I feel bad for Kenny bro .
Sensei got robbed bro
Since Sensei doesn't want to fight again and respect to that he's the best dude out there the Temper rematch has to happen!
i didn’t deep how kenny had this much skill in such a small time it literal looks like he’s been boxing for years!!🫶🏻
Fuck what everyone says Kenney won
Love kenny
Fucking hell Kenny he went from doing a McDonald's prank to being a beast at boxing
Bro you lost against faze sansei
King Kenny!
amazing documentary ❤️ im proud of you kenny! you did great, that was very brave of you 🥊
The biggest test for Kenny would be Slim. Book it !
Congrats Kenny🔥
This documentary is sick man! huge congrats on the fight. keep going, love always
I’ll be honest with you bro. I was one of them people saying that sensei got robbed coz I focused on the good hits he got on you but after watching this video I admit it I was wrong. Big up you man. Congrats 👏
Kenny vs slim in the January card please
Kenny deserves this all the hard work,time and commitment he has done has really paid off! Congrats King!
Cold
I’m proud of you but you still lost bruh
i scored the fight for sensei because i thought it was quite clear that he won but fair enough to kenny he worked hard and wanted to win.
let's go champ🤩🤩and so much respect for daley and sensei
this was such a good watch, proud of you kenny
NDL
W kenny
I AM INSPIRED!!! Let<s go Kenny we are so proud of you, you shown us all how dedicated you are to this sport and to winning. You are forever solidified in histoty!!!
Fraud. Paid the refs twice now
So much respect to Kenny and Sensei u deserved it I thought Sensei won I couldnt root for one boxer but u both were warriors keep going Kenny u have a long path ahead!
U lost tho :/
Kenny vs JJ before tommy
You’re the champ
Big up King 🤩
Amazing editing really brought out a message within the video
Best video i have seen in a while
i feel like this is a death do cumentury. with the musci and stuff 😂
I’ve been a major fan of Faze since the jump. I’ll ride for Faze allday everyday. What I can ride with, is the delusion some of these guys have. No fuckin way Kenny lost. I’m not even sure how anyone could even come up with some shit like that. I’m sure the UK rides for their own like we do here in the US, but there’s a fine line between fact an fiction that some of these mfs need to jump over. Let Kenny celebrate his victory, he’s earned this. Hopefully the next fight will be in the US. I’d like to go to one, I’m just not leavin the Us for it lmao
17:28 💀
24:40 that aged well
Opinions are like assholes… everyone has them. Go enjoy your win, Kenny! 👊🏼
this is absolutely beautiful, congratulations king ❤
17:32 keny looking a young after boxing
I fking love you kenny but surely it’s 0-2 now..
Hard work beats talent, that was hard bro despite everything against you 👊🏾
Huge respect to King Kenny for grinding non-stop 🔥🔥🔥
This is beautiful ❤️ irrespective of the broken nose he still pulled through ☺️ you are a motivation to a lot of people man! 😎
A MOVIE
This is beautiful ❤️ irrespective of the broken nose he still pulled through ☺️ you are a motivation to a lot of people man! 😎
Kennnnnnnnnnny ❤️
Kenny still hasn’t won a fight and that’s facts.
You lost that fight you didn’t deserve to win
Another rigged fight 😂
eyyy can you just give faze sensei his dub now you didnt win accept it
what a video.. wow♥♥
24:10 yeah right....
much love from Ethiopia king kenny..fuck da haters
Quality content brother ;
YOURE THE GOAT
I think Kenny lost the fight, draw at best. but he didn't pick the Judges and he shouldn't get hate for it. Even a loss is an incredibly impressive performance
Yes Kenny 🥊
37:00 ngl that stop there by the ref is RIGGED
Mate you worked hard no doubt but you’ve robbed 2 people of there deserved win in the ring 🤷‍♂️
Faze Sensei Won.
sharky was speaking facts yoh
no disrespect to kenny but faze sensei deserved that win.
👍
32:24 such inspirational words
Bro this should have more then 9k views!
Best video ever
Still a robbery
Kenny hasn't won a round
No way wisdom
This was actually fire, you should consider making more documentaries like this in the future. 10/10 fight and 10/10 movie
Respect to sensei  Living as a sensei
Bro why this so deep
That is mad good
idk how you can watch the fight and say sensei won it was very clearly closer to a draw than either winning im glad kenny and sensei had respect for eachother im glad kenny won i hope he stops getting hate for something out of his control but by PBA kenny won and im proud this was a beautiful documentary
22:21 thats true, people are giving him hate for nothing he did, he went in the fight and tried his heart.”
Kenny the goat
my guy made a whole movie and he's 0-2 LMAO
38-38. lol ok
21:55 hes so nice wtf, im literally crying man
I rate you bro but you didn’t beat sensei none the less you got the win it happens and I don’t blame you ur not the judge so none the less congrats
This is the biggest L UK YouTube has taken in a while
21:14 kenny “if you win, and the majority of people online said you lost;, its like you domt wanna win anymore” bro awww im about to cry hearing this, hes such a nice guy
Great fight between Temper, but the event was an absolute shambles lol
Big respects for a great fight but lets all be honest sensei won that fight clearly
Big up kenny ❤️🇳🇬💚
Big up kenny ❤️🇳🇬💚
17:35 AWWWW THE WORDS FROM HIS LITTLE BRO
SO LOONG SINCE U UPLOADED
16:50 after the judge said the 2nd scores holy i was so fcuking nervous, i felt my heart stopped and i couodjt move
Your a champion brother ! People can say what they want to say
I’m proud to be a fan of yours for so many years now. You’ve made my childhood. Thank you. King Kenny!
Kenny with the dub....but sort out yout hairline
This was insane! 🔥
Beta squad rigs there fights aka Kenny to win
I respect you Kenny, you’re a good fighter. But you did lose both faze members twice
How on earth can u score it 39 to 37 for Kenny,That is some of the worst judging I've ever seen in my life,Absolutely rigged to the max.
15:08 bro kennys face holy, man was fucjing going hard
Bro shutup this entire thing is so biased,He didn't win he probs paid off the judges with how they scored it.
This is so inspirational
I swear Niko is just waffling
9k views in 2 hours is actually mad your channel is dead
Can't believe it man! Ignore all the hate you're sick at boxing !
This is kinda cringy lol. Respect for the hard work but those fights were so rigged. Y’all are dramatizing influencer boxing like it’s a heavyweight championship. You guys are YouTubers 😂 not fighters. Don’t make stupid rivalries that don’t matter at the end of the day.
“the spars that hes has, and hes still there the next day” thats so inspirational 8:05
King Kenny won man I just think he did 100% LES GO KING KENNY!!!
I was so emotional watching this nearly cried it was maad i wanna box now
KENNY U NEED TO BRINF THIS TO WISDOM
THE ICB INTERNATIONAL CHAMPION:  KING KENNY 👑
I wish i actually had a brother like Daley.
My king
Kenny won against Sensei
the temperrr fight was close but I went 48-47 for kenny with temperrr winning rounds 1 and 2 and kenny winning 3 4 and 5 with the 3rd being super close but hey its up to the judges  the sensei fight I scored it as followed R1: 10-9 Sensei R2: 10-9 Kenny R3: 10-9 sensei R4: 10-9 kenny  so I scored 38-38 I thought it was a draw but as soon as king kenny won I was like  I need to get better at looking at the rounds got the temperrr one wrong and the sensei one wrong (technically I was right cuz a judge scored it 38-38)
All what Kenny did is he was just boxing. Kenny didn't make the decision the judges did so get mad at the judges not Kenny 🤦‍♂️
Kenny you won both fights, don't listen to these people who don't have there own opinions
🔥 kingkenny
Bro how can u score a round with a knockdown as 10-10? Even if you did win the round thats a 10-9 at best. Respect to you both but these judges..
been a fan for years and I'm only 15 i do boxing and while i was watching the fight as i saw your dedication i automatically saw the improvement in you. You never stopped grinding and you inspire me in my fighting. From young and until now you still give me the motivation for my next fight in October. Im happy to see my childhood youtuber and still 1 of my favourite youtubers till this day overcome hate and pressure im so proud and you should be to ! You keep doing your thing as once again you really did shock the world !!!!!!
Absolute king
Great video bro
Hats off to Kenny's coach
Big respect to Kenny been here Since he was playin fortnite wid his little brother YES KENNY 💯💪🏼
Bro, have some self respect and overturn the decision, it was NOT a close fight, you were beaten with relative ease.
i said the same explanation on most videos , saying sensei barely threw any punches
Let's go!
So proud of you Kenny🤍
One of the best vids I've watched big up kenny keep strong and keep going www
👏👏👏Congrats King kenny
I'm so proud of Kenny, huge respect to him. Love how everyone is hyping him up especially the beta squad members, he deserves to win for working hard. ❤
17:00 bittys
I'm sorry he just simply didn't win this fight. If you can't admit that or see that, then you truly are delusional. Completely outboxed.
Enough to make a grown man cry
Spectacular movie 🍿 love and respect from Italy Mr kenny
I watched all 44:52 minutes of the video and idk why but this hit deep remembering that Kenny used to just post vids in his bedroom to doing all of this. We are proud of u Kenny🙂
Lenny
2-0 against Faze
W vid
love to see black men win
I need to have a confidence like yours.
After all this, it pains me that people still couldn't give him his praise, Kenny won that fight <3
lol he lost though.
Kenny is the uk’s creed
Man i love this vid made me tear up man 🥲
Now this is quality content ! KING KENNY !!🏆 WELL DONE CHAMP
Kenny lost both fights, however I believe Kenny is still an amazing fighter and can definitely change YouTube boxing really soon. -My opinion (your welcome to disagree)
Great documentary, but hopefully the result of the sensei fight gets overturned… we have to be truthful.
This was the best thing i watched in a longtime, congrats Kenny well deserved bro
I hope Sensei appeals and wins. You clearly lost. Even you were shocked that you won. Stop rigging fights Kenny.
respect, but you did NOT win that fight... The fact you allowed them award you as the winner is quite twisted, sorry but No
Faze sensie  was the real winner ♥️
Literally does not matter if you win or lose.   The fact that an overweight youtube prankster that made fortnite vids with his little bro learned boxing in a year or less and fought twice taking on BIG challenges is more than enough to make kenny proud.  This is a SPORT. As long as you do your best and never quit then you sould be proud of yourself.
Faze Sensei is a good person and he dont care he got robbed because if he care you were 0-2 but gg kenny next time try win more clear
Faze got robbed
BRO YOU WON BOTH FIGHTS FAIR AND SQUARE IM PROUD OF YOU KENNY CONGRATS❤🔥
Chunkz: I am trying to tell him what to do, come on punch him
proud of u🫶
I wanna see AJ vs Rug that would be funny
Amazing doc brudda!
Incredible documentary but you didn't deserve to win and thats the truth
This could definitely be a Netflix documentary! It was a pleasure to watch your boxing journey this far!
But you lost tho
"living up to his name and reclaiming the throne, your icb international champion...king kenny" that final line gave me CHILLS
Faze sensei was robbed
this is incredible content! so so so proud of you and all the hard work you put in. i'm a fan for life
18:50 🤣
🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
I have to comment again, I'm in half way... Is such amazing documentary ✋✋✋✋ almost make me cry 😂
Is daley kenny’s actuall brother??
amazing.
WE NEED THE TEMPER REMATCH, PUT THAT BOY TO SLEEEEEP

WHOAAA KING MADE BOXING LOOK EASY... bro Congratulations u did great work, Well Done. #UShockTheworld #KK
Proud of you Kenny❤
no matter what kenny is my winner<3
The beta squad brotherhood is something else Mashallah
If you are going to let a documentary change your mind about a fight which was quite clearly FaZe Sensei’s win then your deluded. I’m not writing off the fact that they both worked hard. I’m just judging from what happened in the fight
Kenny deserved this win and all the respect that comes with it from everyone.
so proud of u!!!
now we see that he dezerved the win
But Kenny, you rigged a boxing match not once but twice. 😂😂😂😂😂
You lost
So proud of you kenn!! 💞
Big respect for U brother ❤ Killed it 🔥🔥
This got me so emotional, well done Kenny! So proud of you!
So proud of you King keep up the good work n stay healthy n blessed
Kenny fights have all been controversial 😂😂 with sensei, his performance was horrible!!! I love beta squad but kenny you didn’t win that fight.
I have so much respect for you Kenny. The amount of determination, soul and unending strength you showed along this whole journey has to be admired.  In all honesty, I watched the fight thinking it was a draw but seeing the judges scorecards and breakdown left no questions - you're the champ and I hope you are able to relish this win the way you deserve.
no ifs or buts about it faze sensei won the fight  even the the commentators were baffled
LETS GO KENNY!!!!
This was like watching a Rocky movie. Big up man
It's a shame Faze sensei got robbed smh
Bro that ending was so emotional! Congratulations Kenny 🥊
Honestly mad respect but the fight was a draw at best, you did well but you didn't let your hands go you literally stood behind a jab that missed or was parried 80% of the time but same goes for sensei he didn't do enough Wich is why it should have been a draw if anyone disagrees with this just rewatch the fight you will see exactly what I mean, the first couple of times I watched it I thought sensei won then I thought Kenny won but after watching it 6 times now it's literally a draw at best.
Kenny I’m soo proud of you ignore those people who said that you didn’t win you did FABULOUS you went soo far I remember pranking people but now look at you  we love you kenny 💕

YESSIR KENNY
Man, I like Kenny, but this was just too cinematic for the subject, I'm only 2 minutes and 14 seconds in and I'm cringing hard bro
So proud of you Kenny, you deserve everything 🙏🏼💚
Damn wisdom has grown
anybody who scores the first round 10-10 has no clue what they're doing. Sorry man but that round was not yours in any way shape or form. You heard the commentators ( that you edited out of this ) saying you needed a knock out in round 4 to win. True geordie said it was the most disgusting thing he'd seen that it was a blatant robbery live on the stream . I want to see you win, but it should be deserved, This one was not.
16:58 👀🤔
I mean faze clan
I'm glad that you won 🎉🥳
Ur Brother is the best coach
U lost bro
Why was Jarvis chatting shit 💀guy needs to focus on getting unbanned on Fortnite 1st then speak 🗣
Brilliantly documented! Congratulations and well done, Kenny. With love from South Africa. 🇿🇦
I was about to sleep , its 1 AM here. But the fucking quality of this video , made me stay here . Props to you and your team kenny , and congrats on the fucking win.
Its alright kenny....  Do your thing. Don't listen to the haters.
Let’s gooo Kenny
U got my respect
These mans had a whole documentary ready as damage control for the 2 rigged fights lmao
My boy i wanted you to win but no lie you lost that fight he got robbed so bad you trash for not taking that l like you're supposed too
Kenny u won and in ur heart u know it, forget abt what others think social media is horrible but u won we all know it
You tried really hard but in all honesty sensei won he just too humble to admit it but all in all great fight 🔥👏👏
Agreed !!!! 1000000% everyone thinks a crazy knock down or hit ( he never actually got knocked down ) and that fights a write off. Kenny was WAY more active with the jab and held centre ring 95% of the fight. Last 2 round he was more active and pushing forward. Very close fight and could’ve went either WAY !
Beautiful.... Just beautiful 👊❤️
Proud of you !!! Thanks for all the laugh and nice emotions you give us :) big up Kenny ... Ndl
Big ups from Sri Lanka ❤️
I have never seen the beta squad so serious. CONGRATS KENNY 👏👏 👑
icl you robbed him he didn’t deserve to be robbed like that he’s a humble person too humble
Faze sensi was robbed

12:12
proud of u Kenny so happy u won bro
This feels like a real movie I’m so glad Kenny won great fight😄
W video think u won
Faze Sensei was robbed. Kenny doesn't deserve the W he got out of corruption. It has happened twice now, Probably Kenny's big brother who is a Professional boxing trainer is involved in this nonsense
Mate even eubank said sensei won its rigged
we love you Kenny!!❤️👏🏾
KSI is right your the best 👍👌💙💙💙👏👑👑👑

Love "Kenny's first subscriber"
This is a movie. I hope people watch this and understand the commitment and hard work you put into this journey. One years worth of experience and you’ve taken the hardest challenge EVERY SINGLE TIME and went toe to toe with both opponents. Massive respect to both guys who shared the ring with you but you’re only getting better and you deserve RESPECT. CHAMP.

Well done for going the distance with a fighter most people were afraid to face and handling the decision the right way . Well done Kenny 👏
yooo i was watching this guy’s old videos earlier for nostalgia and now he posted again😭💀
great win commision confirmed it
I thought it was a draw but I was hoping you would win Kenny! LETS GOOOOO!!! Respect to Sensei too, I didn’t know him too well as a person before the fight, all I knew was he was a good fighter but didn’t know how nice he was! Respect!
Kenny deserved the win he out jabbed him. Boxing is the sweet science.
i dont care about the result you are always a king in my eyes🔥🔥
King Kenny tvvvv ❤️👑
you did us well kenny❤
kenny finally uploads😭
The King has won again 🥊🤴🏾🔥. Congrats Kenny 🤩
You Lost the first fight and sensei got robbed the second.
And thats why kingkanny is kingkanny💪
Lol if you are an alpha male like this comment
W
no matter what they say..u def got dat win🙌
He finally remembered his YouTube password 👏🔥. Glad to see you back, Kenny.
dont worry about any hate kenny 💪💪 youve just been unlucky but we know you will be one of the best eventually
Just admit they rigged the fight again. Faze sensei was supposed to win. You are lucky that he is really a nice guy or else he would admit that he deserved  to win the fight
Regardless of the results, in my eyes your a Winner, keep your head up ig 💪
