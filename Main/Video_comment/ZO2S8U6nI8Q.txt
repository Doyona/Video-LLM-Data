Thank you for sharing Grandma Holla with us. I was raised by my grandparents and great Grandmother's who are with us still. In Ethiopia, elders are just as important as the Tribal Sheikhs and their Clan Chieftains. It is the elders who helps the Tribal Sheikhs coordinate the tribes. Elders are the guardians of tradition. The last King of Saudi Arabia once said that the day when the youth are to busy for the elderly, they have nothing else to learn. Always seek guidance from elders and they will pull you right from wrong~ King Fahd bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud
Mya I love how you trying to care for your great grandmother

She said you fuc$ing up my fame..🤣😂
With all the money she receives, the other day a follower asked that she have a tripod  and the granddaughter said in a nasty manner , “well the P.O. Box is...”  you know all those around that bed have their hand out for grandma Holla. Smh ... why they can’t get her a tripod with the money 🤷🏽‍♀️
More than 20 years ago I worked at at psyche facility. This one middle aged black guy, who seemed pretty normal (most of the time) kept saying he was kidnapped by aliens. We never paid any attention, we though he was crazy! Then one Friday I was working the graveyard shift, and decided to read over some of the patient's charts. I happen to pick his chart. Tell my why I was blown away when it said, "unknown object lodged in right temple!" I never forgot it, or him.
She needs to get rid of them and get her peace, with professional commentary, where they can watch and learn, because they are just taking her money.
Love those glasses 👓
Adorable maya
God bless u
Omg let her drink&eat what she likes at her age it doesn't matter. She's great xx
I just recently started watching Holla and she keeps me crackin up!! I just love her and may God bless her with more energy to keep us entertained. 😘😘😘
Love her glasses
Beautiful
God bless her soul. She has better memory than me
God Bless you Ms Holly it's a blessing to be 96 yrs old still your right mind .May the Lord continue to bless you and keep you.🙏
Love you
Heyyyy Holla, Chelle, Mya and family!!
I love her,& always will.dome people not to be going through what she is,they would just be glad to hear her voice at all.never know your futures journey.cancer survivors & people who truly know God will excuse all because she is trying not to give up.God forgives & understands.i pray that he gives her many more days,& years of contentment.its not over until God says it's Over💯💯💯
Holla is wonderful woman with a lot of wisdom! I love watching her amazing energy and strength! To be 96 in your right mind is the anointing from GOD! My granny passed at 99 1/2 just a couple of weeks from 100!  She too had her right mind!  When your grandparents are that age cherish the moments.  Michelle, Myra, Kendel, Jackie and all the family I cannot imagine the blessings GOD is pouring into you all lives for taking care of your grandma Holla.  ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ Blessings to you all.

This beautiful lady is funny.  Is weed in there.  she opens her mouth.  She funny.

Blessings  to you and your family
I love Holla, and you all that have her doing these videos are starting to look Thirsty. Some of your actions show that. I ask the Lord to bless her and if you all are not doing and being right I ask the Lord to stop you in your tracks.
Praying for a speedy recovery. I just found her and enjoy all of her videos. I pray also that she accepts the Lord Jesus Christ while she is still here because he has her here for a reason. May she continue to give us laughs
Stay blessed 🙏 mother queen Ms holla.. keep on keeping on..
Miss Holla looks so much like my mum  she passed in 2010 at 94 ❤ I wish you good health Miss Holla watching from the Caribbean
This is beautiful I love this video blessings to everyone in it and even the people who sent the gifts amazing this made my morning prayers

Don't leave her alone with the fat one, the way she was forcing her neck/head while braiding her hair seems a bit off!🙆🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️...oh wait lol the youngest fat one with the all black on 🤷🏽‍♂️🤭
Love ma'ma take care
When Ms Holla said Netta from THE COLOR PURPLE! I fell out. She is so smooth with her delivery.😂😂😂..🙌🏽❤️🙏🏽 Question: Where can I find Miss Holla address to bless her. Thanks in advance...
Me and Queen have the same bed sheets from Target 🎯  Welcome back auntie ♥️🌹
Ms. Holla has been here so long... She has every right to act any way she wants to act at this point...she def don't mean no harm... But this is her time... And energy being used... Y'all need to stop tripping cause she wants a few dollars for her time... I mean... Don't we all? Ms Holla just real enough to say it... Also she is extremely funny and entertaining....why not get paid for that!!!

No disrespect but if Maya cannot read cursive she needs to get a tutor because she's old enough now to be able to read cursive and like I said no disrespect but it was certainly be helpful at her age to be able to read cursive come on Mama help your child because that can be embarrassing as if she has a learning disability
I love you!

God is so good. Welcome home Ms. HOLLA. I'm so thankful to have found your videos.  You remind me so much of my grandmother (R.I.P Lib). She was a pistol too.  What some people don't see is the wisdom sitting on that bed. At 96 yrs old and still have your mind is beautiful.  Sit with her and let her tell us of the history her eyes have seen and the faith and grace that brought her through. I would give ANYTHING to have those moments back.  We are losing our elders and not appreciating them while they're here. God bless you. To the family,  I see the love and care you have for her. Don't let people's outside view disturb your peace. Keep loving her and filling her with laughter. I love every curse word out of her mouth!! Be blessed and be well.
I love her I take no offense

Hello beautiful praise God you're home you make me smile
Y'all are making it about y'all and y'all was all talking that's why the person said please be quiet. You told her viewers don't by the company's merch because she will have her own merch was rude and disrespectful to what he did for her and his company. Everyone knows Mrs. Holla may not have long left on this earth and y'all trying to capitalize on her success and y'all show it very well and that's ok but please be humble and let the videos be about her. You blocking people because they telling the truth. Mrs. Holla don't care about what they saying that's why she said don't do that. Stop making it about y'all.

Tell her that she's exceptional (all) to the rules or principles but being a woman is not fulfilling someone else
Hello Ms Hollar I'm very happy you on Facebook and I'm so glad you are doing well from the hospital so do you want to be my wife causes you so gorgeous

I love her singing  voice  she so cute blessings  young  lady
I find it funny that kids don’t know cursive anymore 😂.
You have a Beautiful singing voice❤️⭐️🙏🏽🙏🏼
People let her drink her Mocha in peace.It really has nothing to do with Cancer.She is a 96year old "Black Queen"that is "Queen Enough" to do as she pleases ! No doctor is going to take away her Mocha drink so why is it a problem to you....
Thank you Lord
When you get to live long enough that you got some serious age on you you're thankful everyday this woman is a blessing. She is 96 battling cancer and yet she's still able to be home right mind talking God bless her soul. And for those that talk negative against an elder especially someone that's sick watch out, like my mother used to say sickness has no name and it is not personable it can hit anyone at any given time
At that age, she can do and say whatever she wants lol
Looking good
💙💙💙
We love you too Holla ❤️🙌🏽🤗🙏🏽
Does she refuse to eat healthy food because I've seen just a few videos and I'm seeing McDonalds all the time, I have to see the rest and hope she's eating some veggies too.  So precious and her family loves her but all that fast food is not good and I know she's 96 so she can live life as she please but I just want her to feel as good as she can and that fast food crap is horrible on the body!  What's her cashapp?  I want to send her something

I love watching Ms. Holland she reminds me so much of my gma whom I lost at 90 in 2020. Her humor is a wonderful delight.
Watching this two days later and it breaks my heart to hear the comments from some of the people. Shame on y'all.  I have worked with the elderly all my life and this is the best time of their life so whatever they do or say is all good times to place in our memories 💜💜💜💜  Ms Hola I'm sending all my love to you and family😘 Thank You for sharing.
Krypto Chronic.

We need to get McDonald's to sponsor you Holla!!❤️💯 Much love from Denver, Colorado!!💕 When Holla started singing and giving us her thank you speech I got a bit teary eyed. You can tell Holla is grateful, but cancer is painful and she's doing her best!! We love you dearly Holla!!!💕

Y'all please don't let Miah do this next time. Michelle, I love how you and Mom Hollah communicate. But Miah...? Uh uh It's only proper to read the letter while live. We understand Momma Hollah and her lil cussing. But Miah....smh.
🤎🤎🤎🤎🤎🤎
CBD...THC...is medicine
We love you Soo much.
I really wish she would stop cursing because she’s leaving this world soon and going before the Lord Jesus Christ and she will give an account unto Him for everything said and done. Where’s the praise and worship music and the Holy Scriptures and preaching of the Word of God 📖 PLEASE Lord save her! James 3:9-10 “But no man can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison. With the tongue we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in God’s likeness. Out of the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers, this should not be!” All of NEED to TAME our TONGUES! Death is real and Jesus Christ will JUDGE all of us! 🛐 📖 ✝️
Miah getting on my nerves. Mother Holla is so loved that people are sending gifts. She should simply listen to her mom...spell and give out people's business emails like the scented rocks. People don't have to be nice. Mom Hollah is blessing people with the essence of a southern black grandma. We Love her.

🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
Ugh the ratchet ghetto family…Holla should be in a more calm & stressless environment. Let the woman rest in cleanliness & peace. Y’all are beyond disrespectful & do way too much in a attempt to go viral. The family is preventing it. All of y’all are obese & may not live as long as Holla so show some respect to her wishes to make her comfortable. Got her yelling because you have no self control.
I needed you in my life! Thank God I found you!! Please get your rest, Queen!!
Ms Holla makes my day!! Love you!! 💕
Great to see you again thanks to God 😊🙏 she might not know it but see makes my day love her keeps me 😂😂😂😂😂😂 laughing every video
Bless your beautiful heart! 💞🙏💞🙏💞🙏💞

Psalm 23🕊🕊🕊🕊🕊🕊💯👠💯👠💯
Love it!!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
It's just hard, when everyone is talking at the same time. But bless her 96 year old heart.
That granddaughter dont need to open the gifts she has an attitude out of this world. Glad granny got her in check
😍😍♥️♥️♥️♥️🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Holla said I’m too old to be lying 🤣🤣🤣
Please Miss Holla detox first, body and colon.  The Body was meant to heal itself when cared for properly.  God have Us herbs from the ground, they didn’t have Man Made Medicine then and They were healed.  God put Is in Your life for a reason and We wouldn’t All be telling You the same thing if it weren’t true.  Essiac is good, American Indians have used it for over a hundred years.  You NEVER see them in the Hospital with Cancer.  Hispanics use Soursop which is also good, there are so many natural things that will heal you.  My Doctors back in 2002 said I wouldn’t live or walk again, and I drive Buses over the Road.  I’m sending Prayers and Love.  Darla from Las Vegas, NV ❤️❤️❤️🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
lol dont try fixs its already break ! love Morher prayer to this Family.
Glad you’re home Ms. Holla missed you so much, prayers to you and your beautiful family God Bless you all. You are such a blessing to so many me included ❤️🥰🙏🏽

Welcome home Holla❤️🙏🏽
Yes Lord keep your hands upon our Granny,  Lord knows she always gives us life and gives us things to look forward to if we just keep living and trusting in God.🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
God Bless you Michelle. You take such good care of your mom. I absolutely love Ms. Holla and I will continue to send her gifts. Please take this as love, but you shouldn’t let Mya read the packages. She’s kinda rude and impatient when reading the cards. I genuinely believe you are very thankful for all of the support, but Mya’s lack of patience to thoroughly read their cards and letters after sharing their hard earned money is off putting and slightly offensive. Also the girl in the background continues to over talk Mya and it’s distracting from thanking people. We couldn’t hear the information for the scented rocks lady. Please accept this as constructive criticism because I want Ms. Holla to continue receiving as much support as possible. As I said, I genuinely believe you guys are very thankful for all of the support!! Will be CashApp’ing a few more dollars for Ms. Holla’s Lottery Tickets.
Holla is adorable😘Get her some weed for her pain if the Dr. Say it's ok.
She said "Thank you, I can't smell shit" 😂😂😂
Good to see you Holla keep singing

This is cute and all, but low key inappropriate. The lady is obviously ill and tired. To constantly bombard her and record for views is cringe worthy. Why does everything have to be a social media moment these days!? I pray for Ms Holla’s peace 🙏🏾

As soon as I am working again I will share my appreciation for you as you are truly one of God's Angels and I am so blessed to have you in my life. Stay strong and blessed.

I'm weak! CBD ABC 🤣😂😅
Awww I love when she sings 🥰
I don’t like when holla about to tell us how she feel they hurry up and tell her shhh… or no don’t do it but I thought it was about her keeping it real and being herself so let her be herself how can you tell her be quiet when you feel like she about to say too much but yet the reason why people is watching is because of her 💯 but when you wanna argue with the views and holla say be quiet you don’t respect her wishes ignorant stupid disrespectful azz I love holla let her do her
So glad and grateful my favorite and beautiful celebrity is back at home🙏💕🙏💕🙏😁😇

I am so glad that she’s home  I’ve been going through a couple of losses in the past 2 weeks & watching her really makes my day. 💜🌹💜🌹
Glad she's well 🙌🏾🙌🏾
Holla you have a beautiful voice
Love you Ms. Holla.  Stay healthy & may God continue to bless you! 🙏🙏🙏
OK, Maya is just a kid. How cute.  How nice.
Ms holla God bless
This channel would be awesome without Holla's Grandaughter and that kid.  They talk, Not Holla.  Not here for that ghetto banter.  Bless You Holla. Love Ya!!!
🤣🤣🤣 Ms Holla have me hollin…love her ❣️❣️❣️
Ms. Holla, I just love you! I am so glad you are in good spirits. I have adopted you as my grandmother and my best friend. Sending prayers and love ❤️.
Prayers stay blessed beautiful 😘💪🏾
🥰💜🙌🏽💪🏾
The hell you ain't,  I LOVE U G MAW HOLLA!!!!!!!
Just started watch you this week, and bring back so many memories from grandma just listen to you, your family are so lucky to be bless by  you,special lady. Iam a Tejana born raised here in Houston. You are so beautiful.
Thts smell so good I can’t smell shit we’ll why u said tht because u told me too 😂😂😂😂😂
Aww I was thinking I may not be watching as much because you cursed at your daughter. Also that she couldn’t read two pages and didn’t handle that right and yes how rude your daughter was so sad. No she didn’t show the black shirt. I knew Holla wasn’t being rude or ungrateful but when she said she was grateful and sang so precious. And that was the close but the girl needs to not be rude and you all still are reading and talking shit to anyone talking shit as I am. You are all ruining it for her and I’m saying this because you stop people from wanting to bless that wonderful grandma. She loves you all and I know you love her so please block me if you want but you been on long enough to know by now how to have you tube presence. Please learn and act like you have class or don’t disrespect your selves in public for the world to see. I truly hope you realize that this will be out there always for new people to see. I mean come on “we don’t need t shirts because Holla is gonna have her own merchandise” that’s rude and seems your greed is coming through. You put your selves out there so don’t get mad when people say anything. I wish you would listen and learn so that it can be a loving fun experience to listen to her talk and bring us who need her and love her the joy she brings us. Have scissors ready for gift time open her packages and show her the items she received and show us be nice about it and let her act how she wants because we know she appreciates and cares . Please listen to me and others who want to help make this fun without your remarks that ruin the fun. Look at your show and tell me what you think. Show her people you know how to do this right and keep it fun for the Queen Holla. I tried to send her Fifty the first time I saw her but couldn’t didn’t get to sign up but she cracked me up about you calling her a hoe ha ha loved it. I decided to send her a special gift and I know she will love it.  Please don’t be mad but do this in the best professional way and grace so that she can shine without the back noise for everyone to enjoy all her life and beyond. Thank you!
Ms. Holla is such a blessing. She has fire, spunk, and class all mixed up in her beautiful soul. 👋🙂👋

Did you really say don't order that shirt bc Holla's going to be selling her own merch?!  The nerve! That person sent something out the kindness of their heart and that's what you said?!  There's enough money out here for everyone. Y'all need to check yourselves.  Y'all are a mess! And old or not, Holla does act ungrateful when ppl don't send her a lot of money.    Shit used to be funny but now it's obvious that y'all are exploiting your grandma for money and internet likes.  Do better!
Welcome back home Ms. Holla God Bless You
Yeeessss! Amen
I love you Miss Holla I miss you Praise God

Ms. Holla Beautiful Lady 😊💖💕💕💕💕 God Bless 💖 Beautiful Family 😊🤓🥰🙂 Stay Positive 😃💖
You guys please take care of her and let her eat all that fool it's not good because she want it.
Love you Holla! Praying for you 🙏 ❤️
So Blessed to see Holla back at home. I have been praying for her she has become like family to me. And she has no problem telling you exactly how she feels. And her mind is sharp as a whip to be 96 yrs old and still up to-date on whats going on in the world. At 96 please give her what she wants I don't think it will make a difference if she drinks Frappe or Green tea. And Michelle please ignore the haters they're not sending anything and they're not making any effort to take care of your grandmother. You all are doing an awesome job cause a lot of folks don't do anything or put them in a nursing home. So anyone who wants to be a Blessing let them Bless Holla and you and the family. The Bible says its more Blessedly to give then to receive. So let folks get their Blessing. And continue to take care of Holla and you all be Blessed ❤️🌺💐⚘️🎀💕💞
Thankful she’s home ♥️ we missed you!
🙌🏾 ❤️ 🙌🏾 ❣️❣️❣️
Wee señorita .. French and Spanish.. holla is funny as heck. 🤔💃🏽🤌🏾🤣😂😂😂

Y’all be in y’all feelings too much & that 16 year old need to stay in a childs place. She quick to say something. You’re receiving the gifts, but don’t want to read the people warm wishes. That’s wrong. We under holla, not y’all nasty mouths. We’re the viewers & we don’t like how y’all do. Not letting her finish her statements & on to the next person gift. Smh Still praying for holla 🙌🏾🙏🏾❤️
I HOLLA!! hey ladies, be careful with those germy packages, never know who's sending what
We love you Ms. Holla
❤
Glad she's back home..Continued prayers to you 😘
❤️🙏🏾❤️🙏🏾❤️🙏🏾
Ms Holla you are a blessing for all of us and I appreciate your love and time.  If the family could contact Yahki Awaken so he can help her with that cancer and heal her now.  He has cured cancer and many other diseases and she will stop that treatments that's burning her body up.  You all are a example of love and family.  Dr. Jones-ATL
Yessss so HAPPY 😊 🥰🥰🥰
I’m so glad you’re home. Ms Holla God bless you and your family.🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
I love the bun! I wear one EVERYDAY ♥️
🤣🤣🤣
I don’t think she is ungrateful for the money or anything. She is very interested in the kind and caring words in the cards. She listens intently to all the blessings everyone says. Btw, only Holla is allowed to have and cuss. Lol 😆
We serve a mighty God may He continue to watch over you keeping you in prayers🙏🏾🙏🏾

Chelle and Miyah, you all can't continue to allow the trolls to get to you. It takes away from the beauty of your family sharing Queen Holla with us. You have to have thick skin to be on a public platform. I wouldn't even say their names on the videos because that's what they want is to be recognized. To an asshole, attention is attention, whether it's negative or positive. Just love on Queen Holla and keep her comfortable and tune out the haters. Love you guys 😍
At her age she deserves any and every blessing she receives also to do any and everything she wants !!! 💯💯💯
But God!! You look good Holla❤️❤️❤️Glad to see you doing better😘

Hi! Ms. Holla good to see you back in good spirits you are such a wonderful person.
Thank God Ms. Holla is feeling better 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽 🥰🥰🥰😘
Glad she’s better. But I since a bit of exploitation and misappropriation from her family. She don’t know nothing about social media. So why not just document y’all moments and keep them for yourselves?? I hope she gets to enjoy the money that was given to her as well as everything else. Just seems like it’s not for her benefit. Btw In case y’all are confused most of us watch for HOLLA!!! She’s the star here.
So happy to see you back and well. ❤️
I Love You Mrs. Holland!!!
God is Good😊
Glad miss holla u r home from d hospital praying for u God bless u

Hey Mz. Holla you ain't going Nowhere 💪We ❤️You stay strong & sassy!!!
I'm glad to see you looking adorable and feeling well.love watching you guys ❤️💐💖💞👍
The best BIRTHDAY GIFT EVER .. LOVE YOU MZ. HOLLA 🙏🙏🙏❤️🙏🙏🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡
So glad you're back Ms. Holla ❤❤❤❤
You Look So Beautiful Miss Holla!!!
Her bun looks beautiful! I just wish ya'll would let her do more talking. She can't even say "thank you" without one of ya'll talking on top of her. You are presenting her gift to the audience more than your presenting to her. How about you explain what "scented rocks do" or teach her HOW to control the BLANKET WARMER so she won't be afraid to use it? She needs to feel in control of it and not just "wrapped around some electrical equipment she knows nothing about". I know you ladies are well intentioned and are doing your best to let the viewers see she got the gifts and money. But the BULK of the BROADCAST should be about HER, her "thoughts and views" on it and WHATEVER ELSE she tries to say. She the STAR! And she feels OVER SHADOWED  by all this "busyness" going on around her while your filming. Thats why she keep saying "your tryna steal the show". I know your tryna to HELP and make sure her viewers see the gifts and money being given. But ya'll talking over each other AND her. And you gon have to find a way to LET HER SHINE and be EXACTLY WHO SHE IS! No "forced thanks" are needed. The people genuinely LOVE HER - FOR HER!! LET HER BE and HAVE WHATEVER THE HELL SHE WANTS. And if you say NO and she CUSS YOU OUT - LET HER!!!! The people are thirsty for her FIESTYNESS AND SPUNK and the fact that she says EXACTLY WHAT THE HELL SHE THINKS!! And its quite REFRESHING...
Praise God! Ms. Helen you looks so good.  Continuing blessings and I love you. Keep fighting.
Praying for you Momma😍
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Love you!! Holla 🥂 Positive Vibes!! Only Thank you Queen 👑😘
So glad to see u doing better 💓 💗 💕 ☺

People got to realize for 1, Ms Holla been in the hospital, 2 she has cancer 3 by Gods grace she has been on this earth for 90 something yrs. 4 she is in pain because she has cancer, she is elderly & she just got out the hospital. If ppl think she sounds ungrateful, they don’t have to watch. Bet if it was anyone of them going thru what she’s going thru they would not even want to be opening gifts on YouTube. Let Ms Holla act & say what she wants. She’s got plenty of followers that love her & will support her regardless!! I been thinking about you & praying for you since your very 1st TikTok I ever seen months ago Ms Holla! I love you & im sending you healing energy. Chelle don’t let the haters win. & Maya I understand why you feel the way you do. People can be so negative & ugly. Try your best not to entertain them. Take care of Ms Holla & thank you for sharing her with the world.
We love you to Holla!!!!
I'm so glad that God saw fit to bring you out! I missed you Holla and I was on my way to East St. Louis to see about you.
