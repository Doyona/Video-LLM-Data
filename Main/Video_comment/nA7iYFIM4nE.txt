1:21 is a clear indication that he has demons. It said “I took over through murder.” Murder is an open door for demons, and also the reason why the sixth commandment is “thou shalt not kill” 🤦🏽‍♀️ smh. God bless his soul and the people who listen to him.

🗣took pain for me to find my purpose. make sure i was worthy.
After millions of times, watching this, I see the fight for his soul . This isn’t just blasphemy if you look closely he goes to a priest. He stands over the cross ✝️. Puts the blood of the lamb of God on his head. It’s like he wants to see who will win his soul. May God forgive him.
He told y’all he sold his soul back in September he was gone ball forever
Im 29 years old leaving in morocco broke but 6 years from now i will be multi millionaire in this song will be one of the first ones to put on my RR Wraith

Yeah I just don't get it it's not to be cool or shock value they sell their soul because that's a part of the agenda and the New World Order you'll see
devil worshiper
The people that don’t like this song should get a Covid test , they ain’t got no taste . 👅
Banga ! 🔥🔥
The Lord created the universe and everything that comes with it. He created man In his image and endowed us with free will. This in itself is a blessing and a curse ( oxymoron).Parameters set buy the one who gave us the ability to choose but are chastised by their choice(10 Commandments) Hypocrite, how can u dictate the choice u provide but allow it as a possibility.
Them may Taurus are real demons!!!
👎🏾
The second verse- all i gotta say
🔥🔥🔥🔥
HARD
I had a book before I wrote a hook 🧏‍♂️
Might be the most evil song I’ve ever heard.

Definitely sold his soul but son fire
My guy then sold his soul smh ….. the music industry is ran by the devils minions if your not promoting death and destruction than you don’t eat take a look at how the music industry gradually took a turn the 1980’s all about singing and woman the 1990’s was about making money by selling drugs and woman the early 2000’s was when trap music started it was all about how many bricks you can sell and how much jewelry you can buy everybody was rapping bout keys for 10 grand lol …. Around 2010 is when drill came and now it’s all about murder and intake of drugs not selling drugs but doing drugs and killing ppl ….. pay attention ppl this was all planned by the higher ups
Like y’all bucks ain’t slow enough 🤣🤣I caught that niggas Int out side too hunt big diss
They get the low and don’t do nun, we get the low and sober up  😈

Hello everybody in love I say turn away from the world it's influences and sins. The Lord Jesus Christ loves us all and died for our sins so that we may get into heaven through him for he is the only way. Accepting Jesus Christ as your lord Savior and following his ten commandments and accept him as your lord and savior. You're doing yourself a disservice by not submitting to him out of love and not anything else. Seek the kingdom of God first and all things shall be added on to you. Be blessed brothers and sisters.
to many people are sleeping on him, they got to wake the fuck up.

Life is a transaction, whether you sell your soul for happiness, success, or money. We all sell our souls for something in the end, just make sure you get you money’s worth.
I ain't say nothing and they all heard me!

We are all born with a sinful nature. To live eternally in paradise and escape eternal torment in hell, we must accept the sacrifice that Jesus made on the cross.  Even though Jesus is God, He came to earth to be a sacrifice for us so that we could live with Him, God the Father and God the Holy Spirit forever. We can't save ourselves by doing good works. Only faith in what Jesus did will save us. Just by believing, we are saved eternally. It can't be lost no matter what. After that, we trust God to do good works in us. It's all about what Jesus did, not what we do.  ...if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.                                                Romans 10:9
this was fire

Right in our face, but it's just acting lmaooooooo ok
ok
I ain't said nothing but still they heard me🥶
if you call this shit music? then you are a fucktard
Our hearts are evil and sinful,  making us unworthy of going to Heaven. But because God is so good and because He loves us so much, He sent Jesus Christ to die for us on the cross. He died and rose from the grave three days later, and now sits on the right hand of God in Heaven. if you believe this in your heart and confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, you will be saved from Hell and go to Heaven. but you also must turn from your sins and live according to the Word of God, the Bible. if you are willing to give your life to Jesus, repeat this prayer with me: “Lord Jesus, i pray for forgiveness of my sins. i believe you died for my sins and rose on the third day, and i claim you as my Lord and Savior. i repent of my sins and promise to live my life for you. In Jesus’ name, Amen.” Jesus will come back very soon to collect His faithful, but everyone else left behind will go to hell. i don’t want you to go there. He loves us very much even through everything bad we’ve done. He healed me from so many things, and i know He can heal you too. God bless you :D

People are dummies. Now you saying he sold his soul to the music industry just because he’s successful and made this video. He’s just playing off of the demon line in the lyrics. This video did exactly what they wanted it to do. Hard asf.. Open your ears.. He sold his soul to the streets.. He’s never talking any industry shit. Pay attention. He’s telling his story on every album. Every track. Y’all making baseless claims off of one video.. Smdh
