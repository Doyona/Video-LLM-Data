We need one of these from TEMU, James.

But I absolutely love your videos
I haaaaaate him
Only one who thought his eyes was bloodshot red at the end
I   love.    It
you 10/10 cute
the only makeup i  have in literally shein sheglam dupes but i am a 13 year old girl
Would never purchase anything from SHEIN far as makeup i told my daughter don’t do it reason being your face may break out and i feel like the products are not authentic as a Mac or Sephora or Tarte or TooFaced if buying makeup it has to be authentic
james, idk if ur gonna see this comment, but if ur not getting product out of a powder blush or contour, put a tiny dab of water or moisturizer in the palate, mix, and apply with ur finger and blend with a brush. hope this helps!
eBay please
i love it omg !:3
Why 2025 this n my fyp😭😭?
Temu
She in makeup is actually really good now. It doesn't copy anymore and the closet it gets to it is kinda dumping it but making it difrent. Ngl they have like bunny tounge quality lip glosses😭
There are so much better make up on she and then those
I’m not gonna lie , this look was really pretty for it being SHEIN
Hey James could you do the most expensive makeup even if you have already made one can you make another
idk i feel like i cold get wayy better prodcts

4:00 that pink and Purple lol
Wow❤
SHEIN is a great site to find affortable things because not everybody has a high salary and is willing to give out 100 dollars on 3 products just because they are high end brands.
But the final look is gorgeous 🥰
Like I would believe this guy. Him talking about integrity is hilarious.
❤
James I have a crush on your brother😅
Face carcinogens = clowns ! Take your chains back and keep them! Women be done now.
The ONLY kind of people whose faces makeup belongs on!
James Charles I❤u😂😂😂😂
your skin is literally amazing without makeup
A naked face used to look way different. 😮
No
Can you try Thanksgiving makeup or Christmas makeup or spring or summer makeup before?
Man wth is this😂
Honestly shein has some great makeup products, if they actually bought really good/popular products such as the liquid blush, contour, and bronzer, i think there would’ve been a better outcome!
tbh, i really do not care how old this video is, but i think james is incredibly talented, and VERY funny when it comes to commentary. i love watching his videos no matter the time, place, or day, this will forever be my entertainment <3
Bro want to be a girl 😂😂😂
SHEIN makeup lowkey is good

I’m here in nearly 2025 lol
he looks like edward from twilight with that glitter on his face lol
Sheglam has definitely improved and doing so good now that i watch this video after 3 years
He chose the ugliest colours ever and then called it bad
🎀child labour is SO aesthetic🎀
It looks ok i don’t like the eyes but its good
SHEIN is the worst company ever, remind consumers not to buy, they will not refund even if the package is not delivered, this is my personal experience, please do not use it again because it is equivalent to fraud.
i think its a pretty nice makeup look!!!
I LOVE IT
the makeup is actually so pretty
i now you r 🏳️‍🌈
hi...
He should do a full face from quo beauty
The makeup is looking AMAZING like what
That thumbnail gave Kris Jenner

I love the eyeshadow colors it’s captivating looks like cleopatra
James- "It's not giving!" Looks like the most gorgeous human in the world.
You're extra feminine then me😅
your so rude to that one girl
Do a full face from Etsy
Love your makup from after !
He needs to get himself a skincare headband it would be so slay❤❤
This proves that it's not about the product, and more to do with skill.
James was so creative. The way he took a “bad” color combination with the eye shadow and added a gold shimmer to make it really unique and gorgeous. ❤❤❤
0:00 hey sisters

I just got a add for shien
YOU ATEEEE
🤩

Bro, that looks so pretty at the end it’s kind of giving Cleopatra vibes

Honestly I used to watch James Charles a lot and looking back at this he looks high as fuck cause his eyes are low and glassy and I feel like they look different in certain videos
Lovely
love your videos!!!
I don't like it
with my salad concealer 💀
do a video where you give james 2 different makeup products to try for every step and have one be expensive and one cheap but wrap them so he can’t tell
I love you content
Can you do a full face of makeup from Temu
Everyone saying it looks good, have you put it side by side other of james' looks? Its no where near as good.. his skills are what makes it look not that bad imo
I use a couple shein products, they can be hit and miss. I like the makeup look tho!
love your makeup lol
Is it just me but the  makeup was GREAT for shein quality! Love you james you worked well with what you had x
What happened to you? Hello say what happened to that.

The makeup looks absolutely stunning! But i get what you mean.. I got the same contour stick and the formula is just sticky and it feels like tape on your face. The glitter ate thooo
12:03 ill be your friend James 😅😂😅
I think this looks goof not sure if its you  face which makes it good

Am I the only one that genuinely likes James charles ? Been watching his videos for years and always enjoyed them
It’s fucking hideous.
you should do a full face from temu
Shein makes good make up lol and looks no different on the face than designer brands stop the cap cause you want to uphold some kind of uppity image.
OMG!! This makeup look is such a slay, looking forward to the next vid haha
Is it just me or after James put on the eyeshadow did his eyes get really red and almost like he’s high 14:28
Can I just say that his makeup 💄 looks perfectly fine
shein Reviews ARENT usually by the star, because if you give five stars, you get points (enough points = a discount) most reviews are accurate only by the words.
Guysss… I kinda want a James behind the scenes.
Hey cheap makeup can be the best makeup!!!!!
umm james i iknow im 2 years late but its 5 am right now and im watching u
Ooo my gosh, 😮 do you know me, your childhood friend when we were  young  in Libya 🥺🥺

Love your videos ❤
The way it looks like he already has foundation on his eyes
Oooo
New fan. I really like it, however it doesn't match your outfit and that may be why it's not giving for you. But, it looks really cute.
wHaT SALAD? SALAD!!!
The hey sisters is not used very much anymore 😔
I do
Alot of shein makeup is from korea and even it being there cheapest its still good and better than usa. Sadly. Korean beauty isn’t for everyone but isn’t bad. If you are on a budget this is not bad to get by and slay. Also… sheglam products are amazing!
THERE WAS A SHEIN AD BEFORE THIS
Can u try full face of Temu makeup
Don’t call me sister
If u want emo makeup 👇
i’ve been feeling very anxious and genuinely just not good at all, and these videos have been a form of therapy. they’re very distracting but also entertaining to help get my mind off of my breakup. so thank you james🤍🤍

how could people hate this girl, shes so sweet
Do make up temu
Can you do a full face from benefit cosmetic
So i personally Doesn’t like the brand Shein but I actually think that you got some good products from the prize of the makeup like the things was like 10 - 1 dollars and that is cheap make up. And I actually loved the look you got and I think you got it to work really good and I loved the end result💅🫶✨🌸
can you do shein again since them have a great stuff now
im looking at this now and that pallet looks like a lawsuit cause ur new pallet
the chemicals in the sheglam liquid contour burned my face and it hurt so bad😭😭😭
james is so honest. I also like how he is not other youtubers and bribes us to suscribe
While I was watching* this 8 got a shein add
For the price everything is fine😂
10:50 😂
Do temu next!
Can you do temu makeup next
You are a man so act like one
DOOO TEMUUUU🎉
Rare beauty please
shein top
I think a better primer and two coats of foundation would have helped the base, then the colors on the shadows could have been better ..
It’s really good for a cheap brand ❤
You should re do this makeup again!! There is definitely more products and they’re pretty popular in the makeup industry.
❤
Tôi thấy bạn make up  rất đẹp. Tôi là người Việt Nam nhưng tôi rất thích cách make up của bạn.Cảm ơn nhiều
So cute xo
I’m doing makeup with u
14:59😂😂😂
The product didn’t seem good but the makeup slayed   As usual
you slay all the time james keep beleivening yourself sorry spelt that wrong
while watching this i get a add for shein😂
To be honest, I was focusing more on his jawline😅😅
I think looks bad. Even on james he always looks immaculate but the product sucks and makes me feel i need to invest way more on my make up
THE FINAL LOOK LOOKS GORGEOUS WDYMM😭
am i really your sister... 🤨🤨
You look lovely
He's so viby
Slay
U look good with any Makeup
I don't know about you guys but I thought that the blush looked good and that "salad" was not half that bad but I'm sur e that was just the trick of the light and that in real life it would show better bug on set I will give it a 3-10
you should make your own primer, setting powder, and setting spray.
HI SIS, I LOOOVVVEEEEEEE YOUR SHIRT
he saying “She-iiiii-n” me saying “SHEEEEEN”
I love the makeup
Who’s watching this in 2024?
Sheglam is not a shien brand and a lot of ppl think that but is not :) 2:18
Can you please do a new Sheglam video
You're a true expert in your field. Keep it up!
I actually really like it😅
"ive been into cream recently" james, sister 😂
not my type but is okay my type is your fav makeup
Bold! God only knows what’s in that makeup 😮
everyone saying it doesn't look bad its great he is being dramatic needs to understand its not the products its his MUA skills T.T. the quality of the makeup can still be bad
I fell like you may of done this already but u should do this with Temu
You GUYS ARE TRYING TO HIT ON BFF DONT CUZ SHE MINE
You GUYS ARE TRYING TO HIT ON BFF DONT CUZ SHE MINE
You guys keep saying he’s dramatic but he’s just being honest…like do u want him to lie? Leave him alone
My brother  is bullying  you sorry James 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢❤❤❤❤😢
SHEIN and Temu are literally the same and you hyped up Temu

*ive been thinking about getting a SHEIN-GLAM cream blush bc many recommended it and love it.. if it turns out it’s good I’ll maybe repurchase and MAYBE also buy a primer!*
2:13 the nail taping😂
you should have one of your team members do your make up
Hi James I just wanted to say that you make up look was fine you just needed to fix a little of things the products will actually high quality but I I I just think that you need to just know how to use them better I'm a make-up artist from Italy spend a little of time in America and I know your language pretty much I have stayed there like 43 years so it was easy for me to learn I think so I just wanted to say that you have to just practice a little using your makeup products
sheglam is like… LUXURY in my country
❤❤❤❤
It's looking good sister because you doing ❤❤❤
Do a full face of makeup with REVOLUTION
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥 love you so much Jammies Charles and I have your products of makeup 💄 🥰 love it💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥💗❤️‍🩹💖
Do make-up from ur Own Brand
I’m sorry but SHEIN products are actually somewhat good. His thumbnail is making it seem like it’s a bad thing to own makeup from there..
If think this dude is weird ah 👇🏻
can’t believe all of you guys are still supporting James..
Werk
I got a shein add during the video
I don't usually watch his videos...but I was soooo bored I decided to watch whatever came to suggestions....Aaand he yaps alot😂

Your makeup is so good
I’m starting to think this was an ad for Sheglam😭
omg you look so pretty
BRO A SHEIN COMMERCIAL CAME ON WHILE I WAS WATCHING THIS
Oh my god bro stop overreacting not cuz shein is cheap or it's online makeup means that it's bad , my makeup looks flawless and i use sheglam makeup
JAMES! Do a full Facebook of Wet and wild please
Its pretty. If it is all one can afford then go for it
It’s not bad but not good..
Such a complaint box
The eye look is giving sandy beach... I can't decide if that's a good thing or a bad thing
its kind of giving bc like SHEIN did pretty good with the pigment of the eyeshadows and it looks rly good
how does james always smash out these looks so well?? 10/10 🌟🌟
fqr9wl kann jemanden öffnen bitte
Hi, my name is Grace and I would like to have some of your make up that you’re not using that show would help meOut
Beautiful 😊
Honestly I automatically skipped to the end of the video before watching and tbh you wouldn’t even know he got them from shien🤷🏽‍♀️ this kinda dragged tbh his makeup looks just as bad or as good as he usually does it🤷🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️ dont understand 😭🤦🏽‍♀️
that shirt is atrocious
Okay, don’t get me wrong. Ik this was made 2 years ago but I still have a comment. Sheglam is paid to get all of their stuff on shein. Most of them are safe.
It is your opinion but I think It looks absolutely amazing 😍🤩
OK, you know why it’s got all five stars because they’re looking at the price and value for what they’re getting as well for four dollars. It’s giving a lot. It’s four dollars. It’s given a lot for four dollars. Lol
Just shhhhh it looks fine I love shine
I  have  your palit
Do a full face of tiktok makeup

Hi you guys my name is kalani
At the first commercial, it was the SHEIN commercial
You went into this with "an open mind" huh? I literally cannot stand you. Sheglam makeup is incredible and they have such better products available. I feel like you and your team didnt even try to get products that you would've actually liked.
james unintentionally did the pat mcgrath look
hi! you should do this video again because sheglam has REALLY improved!!!
Somehow, I am less concerned with the copying and more concerned with the chemicals in their makeup. I hope you're not using shien makeup regularly and disposed of it carefully.
SLAYYYY
Most of the makeup u have is from Shein 😂
But we don’t hate you we love you 🥰
James did you what the video saying you will hate James Charles after you watch this  video
hii pookie

I hate this guy, he is not humble at all. He’s lucky all of these blessings came to him because he honestly probably didn’t deserve it.
i genuinely think that this look is very gorgeous. the only thing i didnt necessarily like was the gold on the eye. i feel like a purple wouldve looked nicer. still very very very beautiful!! i love watching these videos. :)
15:45
He showed a whip..
I am going to do this now it looks so fun

Setting spray left the chat i am dying 😭😭 Anyways good makeup 🫶🏽🫶🏽🫶🏽
Can you get along with Franchini so good? Ariana Grande’s brother.
I get most of my makeup and clothes from SHEIN and it’s actually all super nice and good quality. I find SHEIN clothes to fit more my style than when I go to actual clothing stores. (I can never find good clothes or clothes my size- I’m only 13 and I’m a curvy lil b-)
i love shen so much ❤ and you ❤
It looks very good❤❤❤❤
The reviews are 5 stars bc u get points from giving 5 star ratings
I can be your friend since you hate the one you have now

LOOOVED this video slay as always 😘💗
The makeup quality is good and the foundation is full coverage, the only makeup he used wasn't good is the the translucent powder and he used the wrong shade for the concealer
Hey 😂
I think the makeip he owns are from shein and outfits  like  dudeeee
Can we just appreciate that how flawless James skin is...
The cream bronzer is giving Fenty Beauty and that powder is giving elf set in place powder shein is known for copying products and making them cheaper😂😂😂😂
You look gorgeous
I love this look❤
The make up blenders are sooooooo cute ❤
Reminds me of Chris Tucker's comic relief part in the 5th element.
i think you should do updated version of this!But honestly that's pretty good!!!
Hey Sister James i wanna try Shein
We all review it 5 stars for the points 😂😂
Is he a girl?

I literally got a shein ad while watching this video😂😂😂
I feel like it looks so good!! It’s just the blush that highkey ruins it 😭
👍
I think the foundation is a bit light
Flawless❤
slay😄
I loved the sheglam products actually🫧
I actually love ittt
Bruh their was a SHEIN ad after this video
I love shein
10\10😀
Hi sistersSlay
Hi sis
This looks so good in my opinion however I think that the colour variation from the shirt to the eyeshadow  just  made it look a bit weird
Not gonna lie.. every close up had me at gun point, that salad concealer hurt it was like.. chunky the eye shadow was pretty, just not with ur shirt and the glitter puff was giving me very much glitter force transformation 😰😰
Ur team bought The worst stuff I buy some shein makeup and there so good and pigmented
Do a full face with Temu
Lipss
The makeup look so pretty
I actually want that lip gloss
It literally looks like all of the other makeup looks he does. And why are we asking someone who only uses the most expensive products ever to review products that normal people can actually afford?
We need a sheglam video updatee
omg i love shein
The contour is a makeup by Mario dupe
The brand is fast fashion however for James to lie and state that the makeup is horrible questions if any of his reviews are honest because he was very negative for no reason
I really loved the look OMGG
DO A FULL FACE OF TEMU MAKEUP PLZ!
He should do a full face of Temu makeup
I think your makeup looks great 👍🎉
Nine dollars is actually alot In a third world country,thats y u got a good finish bca its actually good,expensive quality to some
Well I think u look good I'm gonna order me some lol
Huh
7:41 it’s giving...... Makeup by Mario Douuuuuuuppppppp
"she-in" 💀
This actually looks so gooddd❤
Sweatshop Make-up.
Can you do a full face of fendy beauty?
Fr
Not the brushes literally being the ones i use...
REPENT OF UR SINS!!! THE GRACE OF GOD WILL END ONE DAY!!!
As soon as I clicked on this video I just got a shein ad 😂
i think it doesn't look too bad but its the cakeyness on with the foundation and blush mixed with highlighter for me lmao but that itsn't your fault its the shein products
Why did I just get a ad for shein
the reviews are real 😑. james has like barely any knowledge of anything stg
do dollar general makeup 😂😭
He used the wrong blush,that blush is really shit,but the cream she glam blush is really good and pingmated.its like rare beatys.
It’s not that bad it looks really pretty. It’s giving monster high Cleo De Nile
Please make a video where are you do a full face of elf
the makeup look is so good, I love the lip color!!
i love my shein brushes ❤
someone from 2023
It looks Amazing!!
Can you do elf!!
Ngl salad is funny
You should get the liquid blush it’s the best! X
He is being too picky maybe because it's not high end but I hv seen people use these products and love it
James those are real people they only give 5 stars because they get points 😗
Do a full face of Temu makeup please!!
I love the make up actually And It was from shein? wow thats a.surprise
Updated version!!!
please do an updated version
I clicked on the video and then an advert for shein Camd up that’s creepy ahh
Idek anymore his content is still so funny 😭😭
slay sister
noo the liquid blush is so good
Your make up looks amazing like all the time
Next you should do a full face of makeup from Temu please!
even if people ask for it you should not 1 buying things even if they hyped, use your own brain and don’t support brand like it (wish included) 2 don’t encourage people to purchase any products from there filming videos and potentially saying something works something is worth of buying and so one  shein being EXTREMELY BAD is not an opinion is a FACT
its not THAT bad?
HE NEEDS TO DO TEMU
Love
so my make up from shein  is sharper then that
I think it looks really good lol
theres a difference between sheglam and then the "dupes" of good makeup brands
Shien makeup if actually a make up brand they just sell their product on shien
Now we need a full face from temu
So good!!!!!!!!!!
You are negive in every brands😂😂😂😂😂 nothing is good for you 🤣🤣🤣
DO A FULL FACE OF RARE BEAUTY IF U CAN PLEASEEE
ادمي كرنجي لابعد حد
UR MAKEUP LOOKS SO GOOD I LOVE IT ❤❤❤
You now need to do a Temu makeup look and these 2 sites are so similar it would be good to compare them.
We need Claire’s now!!
Shein sells toxic stuff. Google it.
Be grateful plus stop being a woman. Be a man, you're disrespecting God.😢😭😭
I hate shein mekeup
Girl slay😂❤
Instead of the powder blush and highlighters u should’ve used the liquid ones from sheglam at SHEIN they are really pigmented and are great quality!!!
Full face from eBay??
I can't watch this shit lol
James should try shades by shan or floss. i love both of them
I think the final look is a bit too shimmery James definitely did his best
Pls dooooooo full face of no makeup makeup
15:00
It actually looks good 😊 ❤
i dont really like the foundation! buts i love this video!!
it looks so goodd
that looks fab i will kill you to me it matches the top because of the shade of colour
try a full face of maybelline!!
he’s being too dramatic n picky it’s really not that bad
He’s being so dramatic.. it doesn’t look that bad and still is presentable 😅
I like the look but i feel like the makeup was just really bad😂
i got a shein ad💀
You chose the bad products from shein there is really a very hood productd there
now we need temu
Hey
Literally got a SHEIN ad lmao
He’s too picky the make up is great
Well cotton candy is sometimes white but still it doesn't give concealer vibes and maybe they referred to the white sauce that is in the salad  but still it's weird(I call it white sauce Idk what it is lol)
Flash back mary😂😂😂😂😂😂
I love how you do your makeup
I see you James with the periwinkle, love😘
You … my little friend are part of the problem EDUCATE YOURSELF
I think it didn’t really look good the glitter puffball never seen that in my life think it’s the coolest thing ever put the eyeshadow didn’t really match your  shirt so that threw me off a little bit but other than that it looks OK
This actually sounds like a load of bs.  I've never seen 100 percent 5 star reviews on Shein, they can't have been reading the site properly.
I love that he uses his hands when he talks it’s so cute
be so fr right now
'GiRl whAt ThE F-'
U act like a spoiled brat , at this pount im convinced that if they tricked you and put the products in gucci packaging, you woukd say the products were amazing. You act like a little preteen girl
I got an add for shien
15:03 got me dying on the floor 😂
I GOT A SHEIN ADD ON THIS CIDEO NO WAY😂😂😂
❤❤❤ Love Love Love
I want u to try so more shein products 😊
James that makeup is amazing
I want you to do a full face of Gucci makeup
I think it's so funny how he can pretty much make all makeup look stunning and if he can't it shouldn't be makeup lmao
Shein makeup isnt bad tbh the only thing i dont like is how they package it the way they do the products are at high risk of coming broken luckly i havent had that problem but im shore some have had that problem
If you do a review of dollar general makeup (idk if it’s just an ohio store) I would strongly recommend the diamond lashes
Hi sisters
i have 4 shein eyeshadow palettes and they are incredible. i feel like you need to redo this because they’ve updated their makeup
Okay I order from them I don't pay much so they are a ass safer
His outfit looks like it’s from shein
Can you do a full face of make up using Temu?
IT LOOKS GOOD JAMES
due your most expensive make up look
I am a 49 year old woman. I do not ware make up often i hate the way it feels on my skin it makes me feel claustrophobic . Living in south Georgia U.S.A is another reason it is too dang hot to ware make up. I will ware a tinted gloss and a nude shadow from time to time and call it a day. Maybe when i have to renew my drivers license in 2025 i will get my make up professionally done being i do not know how to do it.
L
can you do one on temu?
the flashback😐😶
You actually suit it … it’s not bad
SALAD LMAO
It looks great
Doesnt match the cloth
LOVE THIS!!!!! :P
I love how a shein ad came when I clicked the video 😂
James, you should try again!
The makeup looks so nice! So why do you think it is horrible?
Your the best 💗 btw this week i ordered some stuff form Shein like :eyepatches٫face masks ect.
If he didn't know this makeup was shein, and told a highet brand he'd love it.
Bffr I got full. Face for 35$
hi
Love the earrings❤
Temu next
Please do a full face of Florence by mills makeup
That is so cute
Pretty
most people rate shien products really good because its cheap and affordable and its mostly good quality, and most people review it really high because they want people to like their review for shien points just to let you know.
Love you so much!!! Your honesty is refreshing… sometimes winning the battle is more important then winning the war… don’t listen to haters. Got your back.. thanks for the entertaining content ❤❤❤❤ ~Kimberly
It looks good!
You should do Walmart!
So pretty
How the hell this  guy hands are prettier than mine 😂
Update of shein!! They have new productsss
I love how James risks his life with a shein oreder
U should try temu makeup full face
Can u do m&m do Ur makeup please 🥺 I'm begging u
This makeup look was actually cute ngl...
Do titok makeup
You need to do this video again, Shein has gotten so many new products since then!
okay but were the brushes worth it?
to be honest i love it
The fact it came from shein I think it looks nice ❤
*watching this peacefully*         *shein ad comes up*
Honestly, I feel like it could’ve been better if you had picked up the products and what you felt would be good for you and also I feel like some setting spray would’ve helped
"Its the sun rays
He or She?
If the clothes from SHEIN are filled with toxins then imagine what’s in the makeup
You video is so good  ❤❤
Honestly, if he wasn't good it was she in he wouldn't have been so strict on it. The makeup actually isn't that bad, from someone who has some makeup from she in to. To think he's so just for what
I subcribed
that was a nice , makeup look
i love how he does his make up when i turn 15  im going to try to do his make up look ❤
Its the sunshine
La gente hace reviews en Shein por que reciben puntos, y los puntos los pueden usar como descuentos, aun que el producto sea malo de igual manera  hacen reviews…
I love ur nails girly
SHEIN is controversial because it’s unethical. Believe it or not but a lot of other big high end companies (ie; gucci, nike, uniqlo, adidas, hollister, a&f, and basically every other fast fashion brand out there)are unethical, almost all of them benefiting from either borderline slavery or child labor. SHEIN is singled out because it also copies work from small businesses owners. Try to avoid shopping at the mall and try thrifting, if you could! Thank u ☺️
13:41 don't his eyes look so irritated? 😶
I have the contour and I honestly love it , It did feel like a normal contour to me but they may have changed the formula tbh
At least it's better than what I can do. I suck at makeup.
I think James should pick the products from shein because there is a lot of verity and I feel like he could put something gorgeous together.
Hi sisters James Charles here
You should do a makeup videon from Temu
OMG 😱
I use it especially their matte lipgloss in Crimson that I replaced my MAC retro that I have been using for 7 years.  For a drag Queen look, he nailed it. So much fuss and negativity eventhough it looked great.
I love your makeup look😊
nasty you need god
Hi james
it looks Soo goodd whatt
It is nice but the tectures are not that good by looking at it?!?!
CAN YOU DO A FULL FACE OF MAKEUP FROM H&M ?
For this to be shien makeup  I do agree that it looks stunning. I think nowadays a lot of people don’t have the money to go out and buy high end makeup products. Therefore this is definitely a dupe! Especially in that sunlight!
him trynna pronounce the word 🤣 for the warnings 😂😂😂😂😭😭😭😭😭😭 just give it up
U spent 277.62 on wish and SHEIN🥹
mad pretty 4 shein <3
Love it
Can you review Grove Products from target?
Nice, I tried it and it was so good!!! Thank you
Br. When he said she in is known for their coupon codes a shein add just came up….l
its irritating his eyes if he wore it any longer it will probably give him an eye infection
A lot of people in reviews lie and make it sound better, because they get Shein points Everytime somebody likes there review.
i9t is nices
Either your team picked the wrong shades and palette for you or you cant really see how good it looks on you!
This video is just shady af
honestly, i start to think people just judge make up based off how much it is 🤷🏾‍♀️
girl you look so pretty with out make up
the eye look is giving beach vibes
it looks beautiful xx
Can u pls do a full face of Gucci makeup products pls x
your a man
It’s cute❤❤❤❤ you should have just put on a blue outfit
You should do a full face of Temu makeup
Better then I could ever do!
it looks perfectly fine
Ok but ur just saying its bad when it was actually really good because its no 150$ like ur used to.
walmart next
By the way shein does exploited labour
You forgot the eyeliner and the. Highlighter😠
I ❤ it
Youre so butyful without makeup
Ate that❤
Honestly the foundation looks really oily and wet. But that is just the product and I’m very confused why all of the products got 5 stars….
“GIRL WHAT THE F-“
Please make a video using oversized everything // mini everything from brushes eyeshadow ect
Your face ain't giving what it should 😂
I got a SHEIN ad-
Bro better shut his goofy ahh up cus he be hating just cus it’s shein 💀
i have the concealer in the shade coconut flakes and it’s really hard with the applicator and it cracks a bit but it’s fine other than that and i have the highlighter it does okay in shine
:)
Like the eyeshadow but I think there is to much shimmer
Literally got a SHEIN add while watching this ☠️
Shut uuup that´s look great
It looks gorgeous but it just doesn't go with the top though
I think It looks great but I think he says he doesn't like it because he is used to better cuality makeup
Do a full face of essence pls❤❤
Can you do a full face on NYX please?  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)ᵇᵗʷ I love your videos!
Why does he look great in everything
It looks good would totally do that look my vibe.
I think it’s beautiful but you with out makeup is even more beautiful  I love you true self
is he high at the end orr….
It looks so  beautiful !!! ❤❤❤
Hypocrite
I is so pretty
I love how James said like in your opinion he’s just so open minded
HEY SISTERS👹
DO TEMU
I think it was really good honestly
but this isn’t bad! this makeup look is SO good especially when he went outside 😭 I love the glitter ball thing
ITS PRONOUNCED SHEEN
I love 💕 it
ITS SO BEAUTIFUL WYMM
do an updated version
I like SHEIN but one thing, my mom bought me pants and it you can see the color of my underwear which is embarrassing, and also I bought a sweater which was very cute but again, you can see the color of the shirt I’m wearing. I feel like the clothes feel cheap which I do not like I wish the material of the clothes were more stronger and you won’t see through it 😓
I think these products are great for the price! I have Sheglam products myself and I love them! They are great quality and I can't complain! The make-up looks great in my opinion!💗💗
omg slay!
Even though the make up products were bad, but  you really nailed it you look really good.
Since I'm not doing well on money rn I think shien is very useful except for the fast fashion part
I love the shoes,clothes and probably the necklaces and that kind of stuff
Yes I liked my own comment
It looks pretty good to me
Honestly no hate but it kinda looks the same as his normal makeup hahahha at the first
the flashback picture made me cackle💀💀
Can everyone stop dragging James it’s his review not yours, if he doesn’t like it who give a crap that’s James opinion and also u do realise he’s tried hundreds of different makeup products and has reviewed popular brands and doesn’t like there makeup either so why are you all complaining, grow up it’s just makeup not a natural disaster 😂😂
Ur makeup is stunning! 💗
I don’t need a BOY telling me about makeup…….
I am so confused when it comes to makeup so I thought I should ask you this lol what does a primer do? 😭
I do agree with James. You can see the products are not blending together & it looks blocky. Each product should compliment the next to create a smooth transition overall.  Not a fan of Shein myself but my daughter loves it. 😊
I love this look sooo much! Even though there not the best products you made it look so fancy and like it came from expensive products! The outfit might not go well with it but if it was matched to the outfit it would be even better! My opinion is you look good in everything!
SLLLLLAAAAAYYYYYY SISTTTTEEERRR SSSLLLLLAAAAYYYYY!!!!!!!
I mean tarte
Can you please do tarter.
And it looked even better in the sunlight! :')
I liked the look
James needs to do this again since their are more cute products
Can u test make up off etsy
Shelglam primer the first item he used I have like more then half of my cart in SHEIN is full of shelglam makeup and skincare stuff ! And it’s coming on the 27th of Aprilwhich is 2 days for me
i think it looks pretty good for shein cheap makeup. 😁
I would never put that makeup on my face
Can definitely see the cheapness of the makeup products. So, I completely agree with James. The eyeshadow wasn't good. Although he did very good applying it.
You shud do a full face of nars
2:13 кайф
ни шин а шейн
Why is it when his team pick his makeup his shade match is 🎉🎉🎉🎉❤
Not me getting the ad to download SHEIN while watching this-
Lol at 4:32 he sounds kinda dumb
If u just showed this makeup look in a video without  saying anything about it being shein i would never guess that it was.
Please do a review of drunk elephant!!!

His eyes bing red from the make up I gusse  /when he use a rare beauty brand his eyes stayed normal
SALAD 💀
it looks nice just to much gold, and glitter btw love the vids
I’ll be your friend I’ll respond to all the tiktoks
At this point he could be a male or female and personally I forgot 💀
And also they didn't try some of Sheglam's most liked products like the liquid blushes and cream contours !
Why is he saying that he didn't like even though he chose the colors ? Like wtf
I one tried a Shein lip tint and had a severe allergic reaction 😭
itu bagus dah
and the shirt he bought  Seems like he got it from shein
I like it
I want to congratulate you James, for getting out of the stereotypes because you dont even know how many people you are helping-but dont ever get stuck on any stereotype yourself- Be yourself! F@$k people!  Amen 🙏🏼  Its hard to be a human
Go queen I love u
temu makeup !!!!
can u do aliexpress sometime James you always make everything look pretty on u
I just love your top...
IM SO HAPPY JAMES CHARLES SAID MY NAME ,btw my name is MILANI GIRARD AND U SAID MY NAME I always say I own the brand Milani but I don’t sadly lol..!!!!!!!!
it looks really pretty but you are obviously talented and not all of us are and it was just the fit throwing me off like you said it just want a match
Am I the only one comparing James and Brad Mondo
The color combo on your eyes is very pretty but as for the rest of the makeup 👎🏻
James
litterally the products were fine, he just cant do makeup
He low-key complained the whole video, than tried to put shein down before even trying the makeup. Weird.
All reviews are real bc every time yih get a like in a review you get points
i love the look
Can we talk about how cute the shirt is
I thought James Charles didn’t exist
You should make a video of you trying makeup products that everyone loves on TikTok ❤
I love your outfit James:)
I like the makeup look but it really doesn’t scream James it don’t look like u but it still looks amazing as always!
It’s good, but James just makes it sound like it’s a 1/10. I mean let’s be honest, if it was a more higher and loved brand of his favorite makeup products he wouldn’t shame it at all.
The nails are not given
I ❤️it
Pt 2 ? Pls
I watched this before 1 year maybe and I decided to never use sheglam but now suddenly their products are getting fine. I didn’t get the foundation only blusher contour and concealer.
yo si vería los videos en tiktok que mandas james jajaja
it would look good if you change your shirt
I actually really like the lipstick 💄 😊
He actually looks pretty good
hi brothers
IMA STILl try they foundation lol
you should really review shein again. they changed their formulas and really improved!!
9:43-9:48 was my all time fav moment of this entire video.
But why are u keep saying that "i am not going to lie " tho
14:05 HOW HASNT HE SEEN A EYELASH CURLER WITH A COMB
i think this looks amazing and cute on you
I like it exept  the eyeshowdow color compination you probley should have went for more of a natural look
As a female, I allow James Charles into the woman’s bathroom   CONGRATULATIONS 🤩🥳🎉🎊🥳👏🪅
Their make up is not the worst, but the sponges are no good. They tend to soak up the make up and just pull it off my skin.
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
Hi James Charles
Casually flips us off
He should try Temu
so ironic when he notices cringe things.
People have to remember that James is TRYING to make it look better  It looks good, for sure. But it took a lot more effort and time to get there.  Product a takes 10 minutes, product b takes 2. Product b is gonna be a better experience
I feel like if he didn’t know it was cheap makeup he would of said better things about it
Love the nails😂
omggg i love this makeup
khalas im begging u . enough is enough 🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧💔
It looks fine
it looks great Ur AMAZING
Do Sephora next time
SHEIN makeup is acc good
Lots of people rate the product 5 stars bc you get shine points for rating the product well but if you check the reviews it will show you photos/negative/truthful reviews underneath the 5 stars. never judge a book by its cover right? lol
I cant beilive you are adding make.up from your face but you are aboy
they actually have a few really good products. a liquid/cream contour and blush that are amazing that i love
Slay
A SHEIN ad has just came 😅
@thatoneshopaholic
Hi sis i love you can NOT DIED girl I do not  give shit
i dont already know if you have done this srry if you have but do honey make up face
I actually like it a lot🙂❤
ive got shein on rn
He is probably used to using higher end brands with an quality that he doesn’t like the SHEIN make up but if he was used to using cheaper brands he would probably have liked the SHEIN better
JAMES ILL BE YOUR FRIEND AND WATCH YOUR TIKTOKS❤❤❤
I absolutely love this video but I think u should do a full face of SHEINs makeup brand sheglam!! I think it would be a totally different vid if u used just the sheglam brand!!!!
Skutveny teplos zajeb si dvere na hlavu❤
Do this again please
i think that you should actually get a degree in cosmetology 😂 lol jkjk but you ate that shit up
“ makeup turns out great”  “he ends up hating on it” it’s probably because the price tbh
As a person who knows nothing about makeup I think it looks amazing!!!! But I understand how you don’t like it as much, because your used to higher end products
You should redo this with a more glowy look because SHEIN make up has changed a bunch
Feels like he's trying really hard to not like it. Had his assistant say each product was at least $40 and by a famous celebrity... I'm sure 70% of his opinion would change 😂
🤍
I have those beauty blenders and I don’t hate them
if it would've been a live glam makeup type of video or some high-end makeup brand even if it was bad he wouldn't respond negatively but I think he thought that shein makeup is bad even tho- he thinks its good just bcz of media attraction and agree with a lot of other people
I think the makeup looks really gorgeous. Especially when you stepped out into the sun. I'm not understanding 😅
He looks like a badly either way
I personally don’t like the company SHIEN for stealing from smaller businesses and their treatment to their employees but their makeup products are actually really good, AND cheap. That’s literally all I need, not 40 lip gloss.
Sorry. SHEIN WASTE CLOTHES AND IS PART OF FAST FASION, which mean a bunch of materials and clothes are wasted one fashion moves on and they throw away the unsold clothes and add on to landfills that'll take forever to de compose! And abuse their workers to working 18+ hours and paid little money!!! Along with stealing small designer's designs!and use child labor!!!
Can you do a full face makeup from Temu if you’re still doing this? :)
sheglam is not makeup from shein, sheglam is their own makeup brand nothing involved eith shein besides that u can buy kt on there
Honestly, Sheglam makeup is better than alot of drugstore makeup and alot more affordable. Not everyone has tons of money to spend on something like makeup.
I had a shein ad before the video started playing…
lmfao if it was a more high end brand, you definitely wouldn’t have been so negative. most of the products you used on your face looked exactly the same as some of the other makeup brands you say you “love”. 😂😂☠️
SHEIN have the best makeup
Say gosh instead of using the Lords name in vein
could you try a full face of makeup from ur followers pick, so u scroll down ur followers, pick one and dm them the step
you always look lovely james :)
I was watching this then I got a BEAUTIFUL sheen add and I’m like 😳
I feel like they  just needed a different eyeshadow palette there’s a purple one in Shien too
People rate stuff 5 stars on SHEIN so we can get points from it
Full face of makeup from AliExpress!!😜
OMG came here because i was looking for make up reviews and try and see what people are buying etc. But this guy drives me nuts never ever watched a video of his before but my gosh maybe he  can afford all the things in the world but their are others out their who can't.  Plus the reason why their stuff has so many likes and reviews is because it is world wide not just in the USA.
gorgeous🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🥰
Gyal u slayed that
His hand’s threw out the video😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 I can’t stop laughing 😂
I love it I think looks really pretty but maybe with a different top it look better and match but I thinks so pretty and I love SHEIN
You should rate SHEIN clothes
Do temu
Please do makeup by temu-
Love the shirt!!!
Send me ur shein makeup
we need a full face if makeup from aliexpress
My sister has that lash curler but in purple from SHEIN!🤣
Soz James I hate it, the colour combo is just not my vibeee x😊
I love it it’s beautiful 🔥😍
I never know if james is going to say it good or bad
it slayed but like change the shirt
IM NOT REPRODUCONG , THANK GOD!  XD XD XD ,,
I don't like the eyeshadow
SO COOL
sis a bost aj kol hr karma😝😝😱😱😱
can you do alliexpress
Hi james
It's not controversial because they steal clothing, they are controversial because it's literally a sweat shop that doesn't pay their employees 😭
i think the makeup was reallyyyyy nice
you should do five below!!!!!!!!
The reason it is all five stars is because they want she in points to buy things
I love it how James always pulls off any makeup look using any product. He truly shows that we don’t need to have branded products to get amazing makeup look but skills which he surely has! Lots of love James💜 n always love ur makeup looks despite of u not liking them! 🤭🤭🤭
I was just watching video and I got an ad in between it and it was a sheen add
Don’t buy clothes from Sheen guys, I mean do whatever you want but if you don’t want to kill all life on earth then don’t buy
Wow
IT LOOKS SO GOOD
You should do Gucci makeup next please for me!!!! 😊 please I am a big fan
your lashes are amazingg
you should do sephora
You should do a updated version of this because shein has made a lot of new and better products
I’m OBSESSED with sheins concealer for some reason so cheap and I’m a full coverage gorly
He literally make’s anything work the makeup is literally beautiful
You got me backed up
I absolutely love you vids I try to get Half of the products my mum doesn’t let me I’m only 10 😂
JK ITS ADORABLE!!!! nvm ITS SHEIN
its ok for SHEIN!?
funny how a shein ad popped up while i was watching this video
I loved the makeup but it’s sad that some products didint work good together :(
i do think this makeup is really pretty for SHEIN but i think SHEIN's clothes are better
It’s so cool how James can look absolutely gorgeous even in the worst makeup✨💖💅
You should buy makeup from Alixpress
I absolutely love shein! I've ordered a lot from there if I'm honest 🙈
To be honest  it really  looks good
HI SISTERS
To be honest I think he should  do it again but with the cream blush bronzer highlighter
You should use the liquid blush it’s better.
Hi  it is cheap
I feel like he only says good reviews ab top tier brands
The make up itself looks really good on you. But I agree with what you said about the products! They are cheap, so the quality should be low as what you and I expected. But you still look stunning regardless! Stay classy! 🫶🏼
Pls do TEMU next
The only thing I hate about James that he trolled Taylor swift with kardashians and Jenner 😢
How’d you buy a full face of makeup from Sheglam and not get the iconic liquid blush?!!
i love the way louis says "that says salad? does it not". love this mans dry humor :D
don't get me started on the  sAlAd  concealer!
James your talented but do you really think talking negatively about brand or brands that everyone likes just because you don't Penifit from the brand
I think that you worked the makeup out because you are really good in makeup, but the brand sucks …
This is the definition of its not the product it’s the skill
I sometimes get my clothes from shein
😂 Thanks for the warning about the chemicals. Why are they selling this stuff if it has toxins in it? I think the makeup looks nice, but maybe it’s because you know how to apply makeup. I am still learning how to apply makeup. I have one of your eye shadow palettes from Ulta and it has worked well for me so far.
its look Good
Can you please do a face with only L’Oréal Paris♥️
Overacting 💯💯💯💯💯💯

ALIEXPRESS NEXT TIME PLEASEEE
If you think USA sun is bad then you’ve never been to Australia 🇦🇺 🦘🍻
I rated something on shein for 3 stars and anytime I clicked anything else, it went back to 5 stars
Pls try the liquid blush pls bbg
Pls try the liquid blush pls bbg
Pls pls pls James I’m you biggest fan pls do DHgate makeup it is soooo good and cheep love you James😘
i have those shein makeup brushes!!
Looks good
The only reason why it says "in the state of California" is because California is very strict on ingredients in products where as the other 49 states don't have as strict of laws that require notices
I like it!
Sooooo ima head to shein and buy all these products cuz you look bomb lol
I actually really really like this look though
Not the shein ad playing halfway through the video
I love your videos but I don’t think shein is as bad as everyone says yk
We all gotta agree James makes any makeup look good
Bro bought his face from shein
Shein is trash they pay people poorly
En lo personal creo que tu asistente no te trajo las cosas más bonitas de Sheglam, pero por favor podrías hacer un vídeo con lo más viral? Demasiada gente te lo agradecería muchísimo ❤️
Tienes que reaccionar a lo nuevo de SHEIN pero en español ❤️🫂 me encantaria, SHEIN tiene unos brillos corporales y sombras monocromaticas hermosas, te adoro.
Bro, not me getting a Shein ad right before this vid
Help why does he look like a sim..
He looks high in the thumbnail 😭 sorry James ily!!
I had an ad for Shein during this vid 💀💀💀
يعمي يسب كل مكاييج الاوادم عشان يقنعنا ما نشتري و ان منتجاته احلا
Can I do a full face of e.l.f please❤
Use dollar store products
How to get lead poisoning 101
You look beautiful amazing 🤗🤗🫣🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹
I was watching the video and there was a shein ad😂
😊
honestly james looks good in everything
Looking
His skills make every trash product good
james you didn’t get the correct makeup to try!! liquid blush and contour are amazing! completely stand by shein and they’re products. let me place and order for you for the correct makeup!!
Vanilla, cotton candy, coconut flakes, and salt.GURL WTF💀💀
The fact that I got a SHEIN add right @ the beginning of the video 💀💀
Soon as I watch this video I had an ad from Shein
U should’ve done the liquid blush
Espectacular, aunque sea makeup barato él lo puede pulir como si fuera casi caro. Amazing.
what i hear: AND I PUT SO MUCH EFFORT, FOR THE CONTENT I- *hey, it's me, ur skin, and cerave clenser is just what i need.*
what are their pronouns? also STOP SUPPORTING SHIEN THEY ARE TERRIBLE TO THIER WORKERS U ARE TORTURING PEOPLE EVERY TIME U BUY SOMETHING FROM THERE
Am I the only one who like doesn’t care how I do my makeup I just want to look good 😊 ❤ love you James 10:50
I can't believe he tried the worst make up from SHEIN! 😩 I honestly feel sorry for him and his face!😭
Ничего не понимаю, но как же он балдёжно разговаривает
SEVEN ELEVEN MAKEUP PLSSSSSSSSSS
It’s giving Ursula
U did a great job with what u had available!! 😍😍😍😍
Temu makeup??
While watching I got a SHEIN ADD LIKE. A COINCIDENCE!?
Part 2 shein makeup please
We’re did u get it
You should make a whole makeup brand and not just pressed pigment/eyeshadow!!
If you know what kind of shop shein is )sweatshop(
hii queen of makeup
It’s okay! She in in my opinion is always dry but ya !!! Have a great day!!!
6:38 I’m thinking the salad and cotton candy is an undertone shade name I’m sure they had a reason for naming it salad it appears to have a green undertone
I like the cream blush from shein
you should let skittles pick your makeup so what ever colour you get is the colour of the packaging for the product . Eg: colour: purple. product: primer so you would have to find a primer with purple packaging
James the make up looks good so good ☺
11:08 literally have that
at 10:49 in the video IK EXACTLY WHAT HES TALKING ABOUT!!!!!!
I'm 44 and just started getting really into colors and playing with makeup, and tried shien before more expensive brands. Honestly, it's pretty good! I've since moved to better brands, but still have a few shein pallets I reach for! I'm also VERY new to beauty youtube and just found your channel! (Don't come for me 😂 I can tell you're big by the subscriber count, but new to me!) I thought this look turned out very pretty!
More pigment then his pallete . Sisthers
I think shein makeup is good but not the best I think he mixed the colors very weirdly together but if he matched with his shirt that he was wearing then it would maybe look way better anyway I think the makeup was a 7 out of ten!
I mean like I just ordered my shein cart yesterday and I got concealer and blush with some highlighter
Why do I kinda love it?!
Yasssssssss girl!!!!!😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻👸👸👸👸👸👸👸👸👸👸👸👸👸👍👍👍👍👍💎💎💎💎💎💎
Jesus died for the sin of the world and defeated death, if you accept and follow him you will be saved from the wages of sin (which is death) I understand this doesn’t have relation to a James Charles video but I felt convicted to share and maybe someone out there will hear the Gospel and be touched by the Holy Spirit, God be with whoever that person is
your literally soooo beatiful!
Stop buying from shein it’s not good it’s underpaying people and it’s stealing designers and small businesses designs
I really liked the video
I love SHEIN ❤️💕
and from hacks 123go
full face from target
It look so good for real
Finally a video without any arguments  With everyone agreeing it’s not that bad 💀
No bc befor this video started I got a sheen add 😂
I love how James always dose✌✌💓
I love your. Nails
For some reason a SHEIN add came up lol
The edits 😭😭😭
I love my SHEIN make up it really good
What these products lack in pigment they make up for in sparkles
Not he looks amazing for the quality but he’s obviously the professional so those products probably don’t feel as amazing as higher end ones do
i wish you got the lip oilssssss
U pronounce it as sheene no hate tho xxx
honestly I  love  the makeup look but contour could have been better
I just wanna say that u should have used another blushes and bronzer higlighter and a lot of stuff u picked The worst produkt their best produkts is when they are cream
Te ves muy bien con ese maquillaje
OMG I love your shirt😍
What was the coupon code
the makeup looks pretty. @nikkitutorials actually like the makeup by sheglam and both of you guys look amazing! I don't see why you don't like it.
Face from temu
i love your vidos and it looks good
Babe stop this looks like your everyday look …………..
Ok honestly I wish James would do it close up like when he was showing the powder for the full video
The technique is what’s nice.. I’m Sure the makeup itself is horrible lol But good job with placement .. eyeshadow colors threw me off

Ik right
Personally i think it looks great but the outfit and the makeup doesn’t match
I have not seen any of James Charles videos and now I'm addicted✨
its not the best  🐕🐕🐕🐕🐕🐕🐕🐕
Fabulous
Get clothes from shein
LMAOOO WHAT THE HECK BEFORE THE VID STARTED I GOT AN AD ABOUT SHEIN 😂
I have SHEIN makeup and I love the makeup from them
if this was sephora or nars he would have probably replied better
the fact he made it look so good tho.
the eyes are giving euphoria
I see and respect your perspective on shein, but the purpose of them “copying” brands is to give people dupes of styles they can’t afford. All love babes 💓
You should do a Full face of make up from Florence by mills
what the f*ck are you a a man
Tbh the makeup looks good for being shein
hey james i have lots of shein makeup and personally i think the cream blush and bronzer is really nice and i personally love the cream hilighter aswell and the dobble sided mascarer with a thick and thin side is also really nice personlly i loved all ove my shein make up and the coslearer was a bit to light for my skin tone but other than that i loved it.
do a full face of ur most expensive makeuppp. like most expensive foundation and stuff. you could also do it with cheap makeup
YAS gueen
ngl this was cringey to watch just because like the setting powder looked quiet tackey & just  seems odd seen as it isn't a huge brand
not the filter from the outside clip  😒
I actually think it’s very cute/nice
I think the blue and gold eyeshadow look is great on James it kinda reminds me of jasmine from the movie Aladdin
I’m not rich so I love the SHEIN DUPES
I literally got a shein add while watching this 😭
“Salad? SALAD? GIRL WHAT THE FU-“
I love this look❤
this nibba talk so much
I don’t like it
Not me getting a SHEIN ad while watching this😭😭
Or ebay
U should do a full face of makeup from Amazon
7/10 but only for the lipstick and the eyeshadow
i wonder how much makeup james has in all 😅
Your right
Could you do a video of you doing like someone else’s makeup routine? Like could you look up on YouTube like a small YouTuber and try their makeup routine if that makes sense? Luv u! ❤
@alicefraanca 😍
Amo ❤️ suas Makes James
it looks fine  no hate:)
tone
why say uuuuh
california u?
reproducing?
6000?
not tell
“It is not giving”
He sounds a little tired I hope he's OK. But low key James is so gorgeous literally 24/7. 🥰🥰🥰 love you James
This looks really good,but you didnt keep ur word when u said u were gonna keep an open mind.Because it actually looks beautiful and u were criticizing it.🤷
I bought an eye brow pencil from shien and i absolutely love it!
Do you live in KentuckyLouisville😊
I love SHEIN!
Omg that actually looks really nice 😄
James drop the skin care.
The eyeshadow definitely took a turn but the res wasn't the worst and the blush was ok
California has strict label laws 😂 everything has a warning
Another video idea can be ask your team there favorite Color then make a makeup look with those Color’s 😊😊
I have made a rule were every New Year’s Eve watch James Charles because I grew up watching you and you inspire me so much you could even believe it.❤stay safe❤
Ummm I actually love love love shein
Damn the last part of the video sounded like James was rapping
Idk whats ur problem its awesome
Great video
the make up is really good but the eye shadow dose not match the outfit
Ngl you look so Beautiful without makeup and natural!
omg i love the shein cloths  but there makeup is not it
You do look great, but I’m not going to buy the stuff.
Funny actor
Hahaha 🤣
Hey  james
Tbh his makeup always looks like this and he’s just complaining abt shein
Meh, it’s actually not that bad.
DO IT FROM TEMU ITS SO CHEAP
it's ok it also looks good on you
It looks so nice
I think it could be better
I have never ordered or use shein makeup but I personally love their clothes and their deals. In my opinion this looks stunning on you but it would look hideous on me😂
Please do KFC makeup 💄
😮😅😊❤
SHEIN is just a store fr more affordable things for people who cant afford the actual item but after all shein is a great app
Looks kinda good
My my a mini heart attack💜
FoFo Boy🙄🤙
Y’all gotta hush. He’s not being boujee. These ingredients are trash and I’d never put any sort of shein product on my face/ body
My aunt worked on the movie dune
Idc cause I’m poor and shein gives me cute clothes 😊
The makeup look you did looked amazing on you brought out your eye color a little bit but you can tell that the foundation was coming off when you put concealer and the bronzer cream on and the blush was just not cutting cutting it at all but at the end of the video it didn't turn out bad
Ima whore for SHEIN makeup I love it
wow u look  amazing
You should try children’s make up kits
how did you not use the famous liquid blush 😩
Hi
You are so beautiful you can pull off anything :)
I like it
I love it this videos
Try a full face of makeup with shame!
is it wasn't shein and it was mecca or something i wouId be annoyed but it's shein, come on, that's impressive for shein's Iow quaIity-
Gente, que vídeo péssimo. O desdenho desde o início, sem contar que ele é chato e fala muito!
you should try the sheglam liquid blush!!!!
Fatherless
Why you support this corrupt brand?
You are so cool I love your videos
what fondation brush do you reccomend?
do ebay!
I love the rainbow Creditcard
Um to all the people saying he’s just bougie and can’t look past price : first of all it maybe look good on camera but that doesn’t mean it will last or that it is comfortable. Second he was applying the makeup and knows how well it went on. He is a professional so he could make any crappy makeup look decent🙂 third, he knows what he is doing. He is a pro and although he might be more spoiled than us with  expensive brands, he does know how makeup should go on and how it should feel/look.
Just found this but being fr the shein lip oil is pretty good for $6 (aus)
It's cheap because it's from the Philippines🇵🇭  And 1 dollar is equal to 50 pesos So y'all Americans are getting a HUGE deal, so don't complain
Gate
I buy clothes from SHEIN
Why his nails look like a period clot 💀
Dogs are so cool
hey sis
you should do makeup off if aliexpress 😅
"if he didnt know it was shein he would like it 🥺" he doesnt even like some higher branded makeup. hes not getting paid for this so hes being truthful
Imagine being as talented as him that the more he didn’t like the makeup, the better the results.
i personLLY LIKE IT, but the blush is not giving tho..
THE LIPSTICK IS GIVINGGGGG
i love it so much i think its better than those expensive companies
Gorgeous
lmao in europe most makeup/food yall have in the us r banned cuz they aint safe 😂😂
Ar you grul
The eyes look good it’s just under the eyes look a little pale😊
Umm it did not work out
I’ll be you are watching the video about SHEIN  and you got an ad for it
I LIKE IT
I have an elf setting powder that was only $6. I'm not sure the exact name of the product but I got it in translucent and it was actually translucent, it was only when you started piling heaps of it on that it made a difference, but I only did that once for Halloween. I use it mostly everyday and it is a great cheap drugstore translucent setting powder.
i love you babe
why did james look so good in this video, like every step, unfair.
Why is he so much more beautiful than most of my friends??? Oh right, he’s James Charles! ❤
Omg  JamesZ U look so pretty than me slay girl support🏳️‍🌈❤
Do a look of all Amazon! Or Etsy!!
You look amazing 🎉
He's just so boujie SHEIN makeup is so good
I personally think thy it looks spot on
Love it
He’s blind ? Lol
If ur good at makuep everything is gonna look good no matter the product
Can you make a video about what the names of the makeup are like different kind of make up for your scan
🇧🇷 🇧🇷🇧🇷
He just used all the products I use
Just so you know Glamzilla she is a beauty guru and she used that white powder and she wasn’t mad about how it was and how it turned out
Can you try Walmart plzzzzz❤
92 cents actually
We NEED 5 min crafts
アメリカでSHEINの新疆綿使用の認定がされました。ウイグル強制労働で作られた商品であり、虐殺の疑いもあります。  すぐに動画を取り下げましょう。
i love you
It looks adorable I'm actually falling in love with you now
He said he was aging so badly and he’s only 23
you should do one with romwe!
Ngl if he was never told this was SHEIN makeup he wouldn’t be hating…🤥🫠
James be funny as hell😂
I'd never shop at shein but I like hearing ppl talk about makeup
Lol people dont like things they’re doing
Y’all gotta know that the lighting and camera makes the makeup look better on the screen but it still looks bad irl.
Not me dying when he said periwinkle
I love you so much Jamesss!!!!
i cant even do mascara
the eyeshadow looks kinda bad butb the rest looks fine
Every other influencer have only good things to say
.

Are you nice
I think that it looks really good and that I could never be able to do my makeup like that but seeing your other videos with other great makeup looks I think that this one is not the best no hate it still looks great I could never do anything like it my rating would be a 5/10 again no hate.
James is good at makeup, but I don't support him
i aggry
I think the look was amazing it just clashed with your shirt horribly.
my friend loves you and he’s your idol @ttvgodpogger😊
do one from wallmart
When I make purchases from SHEIN I get coupons for giving 5 star reviews on my purchase.
The point is, no matter what makeup he uses, he is always so prettyyy❤
♡.♡
He only talk about Shein stealing design but Not how the millions clothes made every months that are Not used are being trow away in landfills HYPOCRITE
DO A FULL FACE OF MAKEUP FROM ELF
Shein is so nice and if something sucks it doesn’t mean everything else and shein is so much better then wish
Istg, even with the world’s cheapest makeup you still look good 👍
SALAD  😅😅😅
Do you live in la
6:24        It's egg salad honey 💅🏾
I love how it looks..he is to extra 🤦🏻‍♀️
You should try makeup from five below
I love SHEIN there clothes and others are so cheap
We need a part 2
You are so cute without make up
i loved your vidio!!!
For me the makeup looked very good!!!!
Where is he’s girlfriend?
It looks okay for it being from shein!
james love i get were your coming from saying  you dont like it but love stop judging your self you are a icon rember that girlie x
Te rog să mă duc să văd cum sa faci bani
Please do a full face of amazon makeup
Personally I like it
you should do a full face if makeup from small businesses… you could help out the sellers and help them improve.
Make up’s gorgeous😍
I have the highlighter and jelly lip gloss I love it lmao
I hate shein a lot, I got a foundation they said was ALLERGY FRIENDLY and I got a huge allergic reaction.
just wanna say that I think because he always wears expensive make-up he compared it to the shein make up so he said that it was very bad!I think he’s so right because it just is bad
I think it looks pretty okay,but it’s shein what do you expect
Watching YouTube makeup
Bro really- You look so good I feel like you a little picky just a little anyone agree comment and like if you agree 😀
This actually looks so good
please try out missdarceixsheglam, its an orange blush
The makeup looks good.. idk what he’s talking abt
James can make anything work though and still look stunning 😍
just a reminder even Zara Is a fast fashion and copy big brands . that's not a big deal seriously since people are complaining then go spend 9k on the big brands since people don't like fast fashion
You do shein dirty James:(
You are hilarious ahah!
You look like Charlie and Amelia’s brother is so mean
I thought the blush looked so nice
I’m confused?! The make up looks good in artificial light, but for it to look really good in natural light?! Baby!!!! That’s definitely a win. I am not a professional when it comes on to makeup but he was definitely being too judgmental…. Is it because it’s cheap make up?? What if it was Dior? SMH
In my opinion, that eyeshadow combination.. it's not it sis🥲
you always look lovely james :)
I love it 😍
I love you 💕
Hear me up. He just beeing toooooo nagative about it. I get it, he's use to SUPEREXPENSIVE makeup but still, it's not bad. The makeup is nice tbh
Wait James Charles your amazing and I love you but the love wasn’t even that bad
You should review millie Bobby browns makeup Florence because I use it and I think it’s pretty good just an idea for ya ❤
Okokokoookookokokok okokkookookokokokok
im NOT your sisterr😐
That the heck is this jako nee
My mom and I have tried different a types of foundations from expensive to now cheap and believe me when I say the best foundation was cheap the first one from primark and now one from shein is just wow I’m loving it , I feel he’s been really extra when he says he doesn’t believe people actually like it I feel like the new make up that they have done is really good and the packaging is just wow, my mom finds it hard to find a foundation she likes and she’s in love with the one from shein
To be honest even if sheen isn't a good make up distributor. It's a good alternative for people who don't have money to buy the expensive brands. Even if it's not the best kind of brand it's better than most
You are such a inspiration 😁😁😁😊😊👍👍👍
im such a big fan
Do a Fenty beauty video!!!!
WHEN ARE YOU BEING MARRIED
Can you do a holidays makeup looks, like thanksgiving, Christmas look, like a hair look but for that holiday
Shein have new brodact for makeup and that is good
ABSOLUTE ICONIC LOOK!!!!!!!!!!!! 10/10 would try to recreate this. pretty good for being SHEIN as they are a knockoff brand.
I think it looks stunning
the whole base is giving flashback mary 😜👍😭
Meh
Your a famison tiktokor
stop
Ngl the end look turned better than I thought
i mean it is sad because i can't evet buy them.. what a life 😅
U should do AliExpress
i am not going to lie it was so so butifle on you james charles
Can you do a full face of your favourite low key high end makeup like Clinique,mac, Morphe..💜💜💜
Bro he literally complained about how the eyeshadow colors that he chose weren't matching his outfit and blamed the eyeshadows for it lol. Those eyeshadows were beautiful and pigmented what more do you want from an eyeshadow palette lmao
I actually like it 😭😭
FLASHBACK MARY vibes by that translucent powder
It don’t even look bad. It actually looks great. I think you just wanted it to look bad so you were doubting the makeup
l'm not going lie, Shein is great online shop also Amazon
Hi, James you should do the only using rimmel London product challenge!
i think the lipstick colour and shine really compliments you shape of lips
Idk if you’ve done it but a full face half with expensive other half with knock off versions of the same product
u should do a full face of essence make up
What’s my obsession for the words ‘hi sisters’
At 2:12 literally he was doing ASMR without knowing her was doing ASMR with his nails loll
I SWEAR WHEN I WAS WATCHING THERE WAS A SHIEN AD WTH
Nah nah nah
no  pls no note the vibe
Can you make another video of a full face of Shein
cool!😍
they should do a makeup review without telling him where it’s from, do w cheap &’ expensive one. half face of each.
That's why I dislike and like this man
complaining for what?? its good like chill💀
James can you please re create this video again, I really enjoyed it and its almost been a year since this video came out so shien might have new products u might wanna try out!
I’ve tried SHEIN, they have really good lip tints and pretty decent contour. Also had concealer in my shade, I’m very pale so that’s hard to find.
Why is he being so mean shein is better than him so hijs kkr hc
You are a boy but wears make up and nail polish …….what a weirdo🙄
How dose makeup ppl have so good lips like bro I need there lips when i look at there lips 👁👄👁
Tbh you come across as very negative towards any “affordable “ makeup brands.  I happen to love Shein and they deserve a fair review.
And now gold shimmer lip gloss is a trend
“Look at how powdery this is” bestie my James Charles palette and every morphe palette I have is just as powdery with most shades
Dying to try that she in blush that kinda stamps on ur cheek
Love the look in the end
I think anything looks good on you because you're so amazing at doing makeup 💄💋
Ignorant 🤦🏽‍♀️
I’ve tried quite a bit of the makeup so here’s my thoughts. The concealer is fine. But elf camo is much better at the same price and you get more product. Eyeliner is trash. But the chisel eyeliner is awesome. The foundation is seriously the best ive ever tried. I’ve tried everything from elf to Mary Kay to Clinique and the Shein foundation is the best I’ve ever used period. And it’s only $10!!!! I’ve never tried their eyeshadow since I have other pallets but I’ve heard they are pretty good. Overall Shein has awesome makeup. I buy from them all the time.
oh your fine
Weirdo.
i like it its not bad buut the products are a bit shit
Seven 11 make up please 😂 I want to see if they have improved at all since @SafiyaNygaurd did on her channel!
GOD LOVES YOU!
God loves you
I lik your vid❤
The fact that James looks so good with and without makeup is crazy
SHEIN reviews are... Well, everytime you buy something, they give you points for reviewing them, this points are redeemable in your next purchase and they can actually save you a good couple of dollars... the thing is, you can leave a review even when you hadn't receive your products yet, most people don't actually review the stuff, they write generic bs just to get points, on top of that, there are people that had a bad impression of the product AND STILL LEAVES FIVE STARS, I don't know if the site changes your rating or the average SHEIN costumer are preschoolers that don't know that 5 is more than 1 yet. Worst of all is when I have buyed stuff that is literally shit and the reviews are "this is the best x I've ever owned" like... level up your standards, people!  I used to buy often from them but now I'm on my way of trying to be more environment conscious with my purchases.
I was waiting for the eyeliner but you didn’t even use eyeliner
I buy things from sheen rarely
Tf are those concealer shade names 😂😂
Agree but why it looks amazing nice
That was good
Hi
I agree with the person under me
Google translate babe, it’s pronounced “shine” 😭
The makeup look came out good but I don't like the gold with the blue.
12:06 My sister is the same way, I send her Tik Toks all day long and she never watches them.... F them James, we need better people to send Tik Toks to 😅
9:27 I don't know anything about makeup, I thought this looked good but I can see the red coming through
4:57 I love your nails
You should do a part 2 now. A lot do the formulas are way better now
Girl who gives a crap if they're knock offs shet is good😂 and I'm poor
Some guys make make-up better than a girl .The true
first off everyone stop attacking james 1. Yall say SHEIN is literally the best quality but u never know maybe he got another product or idk maybe he has a different skin type!?!?! 2. PLS stop saying "omg james it looks good stop being so judgy" he has stated in other videos that due to the lighting it looks different irl and different in camera ( also he is quite the perfectionist so if something is just a lil of he might care and thats just his opinion so let it go) 3. Stop saying " if he didnt know it was from shein he would have given it a better review" james gives really honest reviews and if some gucci palette is bad he will say its bad and he does not like it like i have seen him give bad reviews for expensive brands too i just want yall to know before u start goin off at him
James your makeup is giving Ukrainian vibes 🇺🇦
u should try doing a full face of makeup from different korean brands <3
no
For people who can’t afford expensive makeup, these kinds of makeup brands like shein should be supported and first used by professionals with good reviews and feedbacks so that deprived people can get a solution for their makeup problems
Lmao for the first product they way he's reacting as if that same disclaimer doesn't come on every vape product out there . I'm sure James atleast uses a vape or smokes once in a while
Idc what people say he is the queen of makeup❤️
I am wondering what you do with all the make up you dont use because if you just throw it all away its such a waste . Alot of people are forced to work and barely get payed to provide you with make up . Please respond wanting to know if you throw it away , re - use it or just throw it all away .
Full face from aliexpress?
I would love for james to do a "trying out viral make up products from tiktok" cause i saw lots of other beauty influencer do it and would love to know what james thinks of those products as well❤️
Jesus loves you all no matter what he is coming soon and you all better be ready amen amen 🙏 ❤
I mean I like some of the products but Idk 😶😐
3333
UHHHH.   hi  and I have a good idea for a
I fell asleep during dune lol was boring as heck
The movie Dune is an amazing movie, I thought it was halfly random at first but as the movie went on i started to get action to it so id rate it a 8.5/10
But you have boy niples
Because I know you have a girl you know what
You should do a full face of make up from Sephora
Do another with their new products
hello
He needs to do a miss a video
Bruh doin too much hes judging mad hard💀
Ok and?
It’s pretty 🙁
the flashback mary reference lmao
That look good James gurl it’s fine get a life don’t br hard

😆😆 cut my crease with my SALAD concealer … best quote ever
Love the intro
SLAYYYYYY
I both this phone so  my name is mkodrag but my real name is Anastasia
the makeup look in the end looked amazing, but it was on camera so who are we to know? and hes an expert he knows consistancy and he KNOWS his makup
ارجعوا الى الله  يا أمة محمد (صلى الله عليه وسلم)
Nice nails 💅
🥗 😆
I'm not going to lie but I don't really like it the lip gloss is too shiny for me
tbh this makeup was pretty asf bro
The colors have to be meaning undertones
Please re create this look in your everyday/normal products 😄😄😄
The fact that James can make any makeup look good still shocks me
She in?
It was not the best make up look you’ve ever  doneBut for shein and I was surprised
sis your pretty no matter what so I still think you look gorgeous.
Not gonna lie this look is for me but the eyes are kinda weird and to much powder on face
I'm not a big fan of SHEIN products but u look good with this makeup so stop whining to much ! 💀
I dont really know much about makeup but if ur a professional at makeup it wont even matter if the products are bad because you would slay it anytime.
Can you do another one with the sheglam makeup from shien
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
Hi sis a Love u soo much 🖤🦋
cara ele é muitoo chato, critica tudo, essa maquiagem ficou muito boa pro quão barato tudo é
I love ur videos ❤
I think james just has hate for shein
I think it looks good on you, but it could be different in person!!!
Love it and love shein
tu eres el experto en maquillaje y formulas, y si tu lo dices que no te gusto bueno asi es, sin embargo se veia lindo el maquillaje quizas fuiste muy despectivo y burlezco  por ser baratos, y no les diste oportunidad a los productos, segun mi perspectiva, pero si se respeta tu opinion
The disclaimer! I cannot! 😫  Your videos crack me up! Love you James!❤
❤️
Kayla 💕💕💕💕and on Monday that I'm going back for dinner tonight but
Hey James I would never do  SHEIN before I want you to do my makeup like Beyonce look or cardi B or Bruno Mars or Selena Gomez I don't know do you prefer I prefer the Beyonce look.
love the intro james you go sister
I really want to say thank you for being an excellent role model for the lgbtq community
I think it looks pretty
The thing about the concealer and foundation. The concealer is WAYYYY thicker than the foundation and dries like a matte lipstick so I’d put it on under my foundation

I got nails and they are so good and stays on like if you want to take it off if you want
I LOVE YOUR NAILS
the fact this looks stunning on you! ughhhh <3
shein is pronounced sheeeeeen
She glam eyeliner has been one of the best liquid eyeliners I’ve tried in my life, the tip of the liner didn’t break off after some time very very pigmented and was hard to take off, even a after cleansing most of the eyeliner was still there, of course after water cleansing it washed off but it was such a affordable and best eyeliner
PLEASE.....THE MAKE UP IS PRETTY UGH!!!! YOU COULD BE MY MAKE UP ARTIST🛐
SALAD 🥗 SaLaD 🥗 wE hAvE tO uSe SaLaD 🥗
Is there any way you can do cheapest make up from AliExpress ? ❤️🥺
tbh
the fda are npcs i swear
Everyone subscribe to James Charles he's almost at 24 million congratulations 🎉 Like if you love James Charles 👇 👇
Is so awesome to finally get to have an honest review about cheap make up. Not all of em are bad but some of them truly makes me feel so dry and here I thought it was only me 😂
I love it looks good
i have been using shein products my whole life and know ur telling me its not that good? shein products are good its just that ur used to expensive brands.
sister i love that top!
shut up
HI SITERS
✨hI sIsTeRs✨
i  LOVED LOVED LOVED this look it looks amazing
You look amazing with this make up!! Ita like a 7/10 2me! 🤍🤍
etcy
Do a full face of Florence by mills
To be honest with you I love the look I think you should do it more often 💄
You should do miss a make up
Hi
i love that look
Can you please do a video where are you have a a five $5 or $10 budget for buying make-up
Watching James Charles when I’m high and he talks so fast I couldn’t hear what he said 😭🫶🏼
U said the name wrong
It looks bad
you know the make up pallet you showed that was from shein i got that exact one i used it and it wasent that bad actully
为什么会喜欢你。。。。
I loved the way U did ur makeup and showed everything ...But honestly speaking There is a huge difference between High END and Low Quality brand ..it showed in the makeup ..... And just for the record for ppl saying he wudnt have been saying these things if he didnt know it was from Shein ..He wud 🤪 KNOW its not High end 😉 Just saying ...❤️
Slay queen🤪♥
Random thought but... what a beautiful human being>>>>
Wait why what who where What’s the Intro?
you should do a blind brands video so like some is shine and some is Sephora or something fancy
my  mom  like  you
I don’t know much about make-up and I rlly want to, but to me it seems okay. It’s just as u said it didn’t mix so wel.. most products is impossible to see on camera, but yk it looks great on you! Everything does !
It actually looked better outside in the sun
First and last video Im ever watching from his channel
I actually pretty like it
Love your profil picture!
Is it just me or did he put on a LOT of concealer??😂😂😂 (No hate though lol)
I’m such a huge fan I made my mom buy your pallets and she looks beautiful with perfect make up
It wasn’t awesome, but for shien I think it was okay.
Honey that is       G        L         A         M     O      R       O          U        S
He says hi Sisters like everybody is a Girl bugohohohoohohahhahahhihuhugggo🌚
Boy 🤫 i love SHEIN makeup I bet it’s better than yours lmao 🤣 so judgy ugh
i really love the look  at the end it's so pretty !!!!!!!!!!
I think it looks fine , it's okay,the blue eyes shadow hmm... But you did a good job you maie it look nice and fine in same time i think i will order some of them ,thank you ,P.S that glitter puff was amazing i want it 😅❤️🤗
Shein is really hardworking tho
Honestly James that blush is not giving and that eyeshadow is not it....
You could get a Maybelline foundation instead of a shein foundation
Well I could get a full face makeup with Maybelline, wet n wild, la colors and elf
It looks good 😌
i love it
its so pretty😅
The thing is that the reviews are from actual people but when you give five stars you get points which means that you get more coupons and then money off your orders . So people usually say what they think about the stuff they bought but always put five stars . Btw I loved that video❤️
خف علينا يالغني
Ik this is 2021 but anyways, on shein you get extra points for reviewing stuff 5 stars and points are dollars so people usually do 5 stars even if they don’t mean it 👍
استرجل😡
Do a full face of miss a
Definitely user error 😂
It seems like the makeup was bothering your eyes… toward the end it started getting red 😅 I just bought some she glam makeup as well. Everything I bought that I’ve seen good reviews about were diff then the products you’ve tried so we’ll see how it goes 🤷🏻‍♀️
hey james i just want to know if the shein products came fast.? also u can pull anything off even tho u think it looks bad  but u are the professional so i do respect your opinion , but i still think u look beautiful . 😍😍
Please do a full face of make up from The Avon!!!!
I’m sketchy about buying makeup from shein so I just get lip gloss and beauty blenders and clothes ofc
Hi
You Look sooooo pretty 😘😘😘
I know it's not about makeup but you could do just outfits from shein:)
Why do ppl hate him he so entertaining 💗
it looks good just the gold whit blue is not matching whit your shirt but its good
James Charles...... i have your makeup pallet i got it for my birthday yesterday and i love it so much, It's so pretty and really fun to use!!!!
"GIRL WHAT THE F--"  Got me rollin
I was in shin and I saw a knock off of Sister apparel lol
It’s pretty
The makeup look reminds me of Cleopatra
At the end of the day if u know what u doing u can make anything work!!!
BRUH I CANT WITH THE "Hi sisters! :3 "
I love it so much 🥰
Um this is not his best makeup but it look good
Cool
U really got think it’s really good for the price and like come on it literally looks like ur normal makeup u do everyday
Bro is pretty
That's your bad makup? I can't even do concealer properly
It looks good
Sheglam makeup is really good quality and very affordable idk why he's being so negative🤨
I actually love their products they're the only ones that don't break out my skin and their liquid blush is amazing.
you look like a moose
Slayyyyy that’s acually looks good
To be honest I actually think it looks quite pretty and it and it looks like your photo
Damn all he does is complain now.
Slay slayyyy
I’m in love with SHEIN WELL THE CHLOTHES AND ACSESORIES LOL
I live on SHEIN and the makeup is good it's just that the eyeshadow is not giving
I don’t understand the people saying he didn’t know it was shein when he literally says it’s from shein multiple times
Watching his video for the first time, I had to subscribe to his channel, I really felt like I was speaking to my inner self listening to him 😳
it looks rlly pretty but ik it could look better with other makeup
He’s so judgy, it doesn’t look bad. It actually looks good🥴
Woah nice makeover
it looks really good but not with the outfit ygm
بحب كل فيديوهاتك ♥️♥️♥️
you look amazimg
It looks ok
the first thing from SHEIN
do you live in where it cases canser
Lol have you done Walmart or Target?
Wow it’s actually not that bad considering it SHEIN!! Like that’s a bang for ur buck I mean it’s not amazing but just as good as drug store and it’s even cheaper so def a bang for ur buck
I like
Don't call me sis couse i'm not your sister
james is such a hand talker
Where can I get that top lol
Controversial for just stealing designs ? What about exploiting workers in less economically developed countries
.
He got a lil money and start acting like everything it trash because it aint high end iont like that
Am i the only one who reads SHIEN like shine
Either way you are beautiful ❤️
It,s great 😍
Can you do a full face of makeup at Poundland
SHEIN makeup is some of the best low priced makeup I’ve ever used. Nikki tutorials reviewed SHEIN and have it incredible reviews. I bet if James didn’t know it was cheap he would have given it a better review. I cannot stand him and I hate the way he’s complaining when these products truly are good quakity
Not James literally explaining what FDA means as if not everyone in the fucking world knows what the fda is
SHEIN SELLS MAKEUP?
I like it ALOT
This is not offensive but are you a SHE or HE?
I cant stop staring at his shirt👁👄👁
I actually really like it!! Looks pretty
You can send me tiktoks I’ll respond
I love it can . Can you do a second part please?
Please
Can u where cheap make up for a week
James is the best 👌
He does so good even with the worst makeup love ya ♥
If he literally didn’t knew the brand name he wouldn’t have give this kind of review
The more he said he didn’t like it, the better the makeup look came out 🤣🤣🤣😂
I think that  this make up wouldnt be ideal for someone who is used to lets say charlotte tillbury but instead would be good for someone on a budget.But in my opinion the makeup is fine for its price.
Like it's literally looks so good i will say it 😶🔥🔥
Maybe use a different lighting and we can actually tell? 👀😊
He is always like it is bad but really it does not look bad.
Do you still have a Willy or did you cut off
Looked pretty decent! I think u looked pretty good Fr she in! Just not the color combo or primer! HOWS UR SKIN?!
It’s good rely
Try ShopMissA
It looks rlly good tbh!
Hey James
I like it:)
honeslty if he didn’t know if it was from shein, he would’ve not talked down on it and talked negatively
It looks good in the ☀️
Just saying...    I LOVE YOUR EARINGS!!!!!
Can u do Walmart
It looks good
Beautiful
It so cute what do you mean lol❤️❤️❤️
its looking nice on camera
0:31 when someone asks me to describe James Charles
"Ok my crease is cut with my salad concealer." 😆
Since when did Shein started selling makeup products
I honestly love the look and the eye shadow is amazing
a lot of products are cheap but work really good too be from were there from
OMGGF I LOVE U JAMES UR A BEAUTYYYYYY
His videos are so overexposed it’s annoying
i actually ordered some of the better products to try out for myself as I am someone who is still experimenting and learning about makeup!
Their ingredients must be shit
I really like the eyebrow pencil shame he didn’t touch on that more
Ru trans
Not as good as I thought is was gonna be
You should try this again using their new products (foundation in a pot and liquid blush)
My name is brenna from America I'm a huge James Charles fan it's. My dream to meet James Charles in-person   I love all James videos s I watch James Charles videos every single day  hey sisters
Rainbow make up video with James Charles I love all your videos James Charles hey sisters

well it's k but I would rather say that rainbow one that you did I liked it (still do)
يع يعني الحين اللي يدعمون المثليه يدعمون اشكالك
finally
It’s not as bad as you think it is
DUNE WAS SHIT       *just my opinion but use this as the “dune was shit” button”
Can I do a full face of makeup from Amazon please please please for your fans please James it will mean the world to us love u James 😮‍💨😚😚
....I BOUGHT THE SAME EXACT GLOSS FROM SHEIN TWO DAYS BEFORE WATCHING THIS
I like it! Love the eyeshadow
Do a makeup look as yourself when you were a teenager!
I looks like shit no offence i love your videos
It looks good but I don’t have it on my face and I don’t know how it feels or how it actually looks in person because sometimes the camera makes things look better than they are
I think it looks totally flawless! Love you james
I liked your makeup
it looks good...
Why do you look like a girl and talk like a girl
Me:crying in the corner with she in makeup on my face and thought it looked good
I'm a big fan
the editing has me CACKLING
It looks so good🫵
It's the products you used but you really made it look lovely  😍
Omg i love your video and you ❤️
as a personal dsmp fan I kinda hate you james
Hey girl I followed what you did and I did my makeup it looks worse I hate this so much 😭😭😭😭😭😭💔
I love you sis
ummmmmmmm im now looking on shien for makeup lol
Would never try anything in my face from Shein. 1. Shein is so unethical 2. The products for face are toxic 3. Shein is unethical
don't by from shein
I mean, the concealer names are creative af
A Chinese fast fashion brand that  uses child labour, and destroys the planet. And doesn't tell you what is in the products you're putting on your face. No thank you.
You should try creating a full face of Essence! It's a really good and affordable makeup brand! Love you James 🤍
It is good on you but it's not your taste
lol he looks absolutely nice considering ....
صرت اكره شي ان
Its amazing the problem is ur color combination
Youre so pretty damm
I love my SHEIN makeup 😂😂 I'm horrible
I’m just glad I’m not the only human who didn’t like Dune 🤷‍♀️😂
The setting powder flashback😭
Is it just weird that I do I did sing that little chance because I'm 11 years old I was in fourth grade we were in gym girls versus boys basketball I made all first shots all first shots cuz we're doing this relay type thing relay basketball don't even mention it it was very weird but all the girls and we started chanting that and that was in 2021
i like it but it could use a ocean blue with shimer gold swirl top with a NOT shimmery powder so out of ten i give it a 6.5 out of ten.
you do you, I’ll use products from sephora 🤷‍♀️
You should do a baking video
not his eyes having a red tint😭😭😭😭😭😭
He said cringey name but thats the name of one of maddie Zieglers makeup products with MORPHE
8:54 WHAT💀
bruh don't expect high quality it's just worth the price
Your not a girl your a guys stop trying to be 🤡🤡🤡
It looks good. WHY ARE YOU BRINGING YOURSELF DOWN SIS!
omg ily james
PRETTY
nice
Hi I love you
I love ittt
SHEIN is the best I get fidgets a pretty cloths especially dresses and theynare so cheap
Who is he to say anything? His shirt looks like it's from Shein.
Sister don’t worry I’ll be the one to look at your TikTok text that you sent me I’ll go right ahead and fill that little spot
It looks hidious
sister you look amazing especially in that sun. slay!!!
You sould do a vid of gas station make up!
i just dont think he knows how to do makeup lol
The lashes fixed it
is it me or does james always look good with bad makeup lol
I haven’t watched u in a minute so I love to see you do this😁💙✨
I think the concealer was named "salad" because there is a sauce called "salad cream" and your supposed to put it on salad and it's the same colour as the concealer so I think that's why it's called "salad"
Yes sir
James sister slays at picking his outfits
We want another bretman and charles colab
It looks good because he is a make up artist and has good lighting, doesn’t mean it feels good on the skin.
The eyelash curler with comb I actually got the pink one from Shein and it’s actually really good!
It looks good
It looks so good
Don’t buy for them before you whach a video……
that was cute just the blush was a no for me 😂
I love you James c
there from china and they are made with dog fat
Ruan mandou um abraço
His eyes literally turned red at the end of the video 😳
shoutout to james editor bc the editing is hilarious
The makeup looks good for being shein so chill ur being a brat but ok
You should do only 5 below makeup 💄? It would definitely be a challenge
No no
👎
I swear James can rock any kind of makeup look even if it is a bad makeup product or a great makeup product.
stop saying sis 💀 cringe xx
You should do one like that but from dollar tree or five below
😂🤣😂🤣😂🤮🤮🤮🤮🤣😂🤣🤣🤣🤣we really need a new nuclear war,☠💀🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
i love you daddy!
The assistant is funny.
The overall look is decent, but I know you could do better
You should do a fu face of makeup out of Walmart/ makeup kit from the good but cheap makeup from Walmart                                       Or   A full face out of aliexpress
I'm on the road to California 😂
it legit looks good
IM CRYING I HAVE THE SAME LASH CURLER
You should try Wet and Wild makeup. I love that product.
I like it
Yay shein
Negative the entire video for no reason
IDK how I ended up here from watching liver king 🤣 but this guys is an artist ,I have to say it!
Soo I keep seeing people says it looks good , good for you but it's james into on what he think about it😗
I just recently bought makeup from shein, and it AMAZINNGGG

Can  u so  a Arianna granday look ,Taylor swift or Billy eyelash
Love it sister
This man tripping this makeup don't look bad at all

You look so beautiful even you not makeup 😍
Not him at the end using the Puff and ending up looking like me at age 5 spilling a highliter palet on my face
oh ! it looks nice for it to be from shein!!
That blush looked really pretty and the contour palette
it looks ssooo beautifuullll iii loovveeiiitttt
I like it but I’m gonna say it is a solid 5/10
Can you do a makeup from Mac
James did a great job on this but James is also somebody that could do a while makeup look with a variety of animal poop and make it look like a Gucci glam! Love you James, you did an amazing job!
i love sheins lashes though!
Not really but it’s not bad but the blush barely done anything and just the shirt, other than that it’s fine
Good looking 👍🏻
I have lot of shein clothing and ther fit me
Is there a module that teaches these vloggers to use their hands a certain way and always be ' super excited'?
12:38 omg it was pink and it turned green 😭😭🤚 or are my eyes messing with me 😭
Wow
wig flew
I just saw you in another people's channel and it was really great 💖😃🤗🥺🧁😇♥️💜💛💙🥳🌷😀💗🥳💝💝💚❤️💚❤️
its not that bad in the sun I just bought some of the same things that you just got it was not that bad it not perfect
After watching this I bought  some of the makeup and it wasn’t bad at all. I don’t know why he was complaining so much about it.
Luv ur nails :)
I love you James Charles
You are a boy you were needing to stop this stop calling us sisters I am an emo and you were going to stop wearing makeup
Why does he look high
this makeup was perfect🤝🤝🤝💕💕💕💕👌✨✨✨✨
Same I’m not gonna lie it’s actually pretty good for SHIEN and tbh your right the eye is not bad but the base wasn’t as good
You look so pretty with out or with make it what it is on the inside
Do make up frome amazon next please shout out
I love SHEIN
you can send me your fyp vids
I love it ❤❤😊
Your eye makeup looked amazing!
Ummmm its giving....Ukraine
Can you please do a full face of make up from miss a
I got the same bronzer stick and I think you just got the wrong shade but the look is really pretty for shein
I love it
I love how she always makes her videos so entertaining
I love your videos
Omg!the makeup is sooooooooooooo amazing !!!!!
Just so you know after you order something you have to give it a review and you get points for the review so I think that’s why the reviews were so high
can you do it with kylie cosmetics
Bruh. Do you realise James just risked his life for us??!! He needs some serious respect after this!
I'll watch your tiktoks 😢
It’s so pretty
The shot outside is 😍🤩
I actually got some shein clothes and they gave me the new Limited clothes!. But they ran out the new limited clothes sry..
wtf....
YesStyle makeup?
Bro when he said salad I got an ad for a fruit and vegetable market 💀
I love you James Charles
i just want to say that, don't use the name of the Lord or His Word in vain(whether to curse/expression/etc.)❤️thank you, may God bless you
I love shein
shut up it looks very good
Gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood
omg gurlie i smell your perfume from back here
It good but the eyes......blue and orange Um...noooo
you have high expectasions put them lower
Great video…!
Did you do cherr
Great!
Why are u spoiled
if he didnt know all the makeup was from shein he would of rated it rlly good. But i feel like he is giving it criticism because shein is known for some ripped off outfits what i disagree with.
It looks so good😍😍🥰
Im pretty sure most of sheins reviews  are bought. Ive bought a few things from there and Ive written a few reviews and put some negative things on it and it wouldnt let me post the comment. But its not only a problem for me but a few of my friends as well.
You should do a video where you aren't told the brand names. Just put the makeup, rate it and take a guess on what brand it was.
You made it look good
I think it was just a bad color combo it could have had potential

Excellent
I’m Australia we say Shien without the E so shean
i really do love the makeup, but im with you on the eye shadow  loll
How are you still relevant?
I love the Shein beauty blenders 🥰
You should do a full face of drug store makeup if you haven’t already 🤘🏼
I lovehow cheap are the stuff in EUA. I get like GOSH, in Brazil u have to sell ur house to buy a dress😮💁
Thank you so much for helping out because I order a lot of make up from SHEIN the primer I actually bought it and it’s so amazing I love it in the foundation that in the shade nude I’m gonna buy it thank you so much for helping me out
it’s amazing for it being SHEIN
ryan’s little “yayyy”🥺
I don’t want to lie to you James, I don’t like it
Orange brown brown green orange green yellow orange yellow yellow orange red green
Hi I’m leaving my house now and I’m going to get my hair done now lol 😂
love the outfit james !!
bro ily but u cares about the price and u r so cringe
It feels so illigale to watch James Charles but it doesn't matter about what people say I will forever be a true sister 💞🤩☺️
Put it in my chili ring
Ok the make up looks ok, just the formulas suck and the way some of the products were lifting everything was not it but the look is ok considering where the products came from and the eye shaddow combo was better than I thought
when you were talking about the makeup being bad i was like sister um you call pull  anything off
Amazing!
Heh James can you do a full face of makeup form Walmart plz.
One like for James equals one prayer for his skin😅
It’s giving baddie on a budget
James is Now harming the earth😃💀💩 this my dads acc
I love this😍
Full face of makeup from ebay
I love shien
I love it
it looks great and really nice in sun
You look so Beautiful with and without make up .
Nice
James hating makeup from SHEIN, boo so bougie 🤌🏼🤌🏼🤌🏼
👍
YASSSS QUEEEN
This whole video is really cringe, I came here cause I saw that recapp of the  video with him and Zendaya
Bro you should try the popular cream blush from shein
I feel like when you’re a professional at something, you notice all the tiny little mistakes and all of the bad things that other non-professionals (no offense) wouldn’t notice. So I honestly don’t blame him for not liking the make-up look and I won’t judge, but I still think he made it look good anyway.
Can you do Gucci face makeup plz James!😜
I'm obsessed with shein actually I love it's products♥️
BROOO 1 YOU TALK TO FAST 2 IT LOOKS FINEEEE GEEZ UR SO DRAMATIC ! - no hate on u  btw
Do t.k.max
It looks good
Ok let’s be honest here, even if James found the makeup in a ✨dumpster✨ he’d still manage to look fabulous either way
Its so pretty
Hey sisterssss - Justin
Ok question are shein clothes good like comfy just asking cause im trying to buy a hoodie from there
6:17 6:18
I love you, James, and on camera it looks good but in person, it might look different and with your outfit it doesn't look the best hope that my opinion is helpful.
Your crew should’ve boughten the sheglam setting spray
James you look so pretty and one day i am going to be like u enjoy ur day!
hi im thegirl in the photo i love our videos
:)
😊
“Let me do the cReAm, I’ve been into that recently.”😩
Personally from me it looks really pretty
❤️❤️
it all depends on what your basing it off. it’s good for shein! it just doesn’t compare to some other looks you’ve done. it looks really good thoug!
That is actually good for shen!
I love it
Try a mermaid makeup brushes they are really good also good to blend contour
Im watching this video only ro see gow Shein is pronounced 😂😂😂
ammmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm girl i think your eyes are broken because i cant do that in a thousand years .
Your make up looks so pretty
omg yas girllll
wtf
It looked good at 480p, but when I changed it to 1080p at the end I could see why you didn't like it. Is not terrible by any means tho! You did an amazing work with what you had, I tried cheap makeup from shady websites myself and let me tell you I wasn't even able to make it show no matter how much I packed the brush (wich tbf, was also from the same website so)
You make it look good for sure and u r experienced in putting makeup .
I be sharj g makeup and shei  and rbey sag shein doesnt sell make up
I am not gonna lie James say he doesnt look good in this make-up but every time I see him even he do a bad make up i just see the galm perfect look in him..... 😍😘😘  I just love watching ur videos James nd lots of love frm India
Фуууууу
Lol😂 that’s cool
I think it’s not bad it’s decent
Bro i bought a hoodie it says it was glowing in the dark it did not glow ATALL I GOT SCAMED
Actually I have used the SHEIN makeup and it was really good. Some people think that SHEIN make up it’s not good because it is cheap and not that pricey like The luxury make up brand, You really don’t need to Pay a lot of money to have a good and perfect make up.
It’s give me what it    👑👑👍👍
كرييييييه
👍👍👍👍
Flash back 8:54 here u go sisters
u should try their liquid color eye liners, the best thing they have
You have to rate it when you buy it andafter it comes that’s why it has 5 stars 😭
I didn’t even know that shine had makeup
It looks exactly the same when u use morphe products
Are you a girl
Oh my gosh I cannot stop you’re so beautiful
I loved it! The blue and gold eye look was so pretty and the lip gloss too! Gold and silver makeup has been my favorite lately <3
It was good but I would not get it and it has way to much glitter or like gold
you look amazing
hi
I love James Charles so much
James ur being ~OVEREACTIVE~ It looks fine
IM SORRY BUT JAMES HOW DO YOU LOOK SO PRECOUS. clothes?!? AHEM WHERE?!
IM SO CONFUSED...SALAD???
smash
I absolutely love your TikTok also I love your morphe palette
,
Yas
I hate makeup on boys so cringe
I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS JUST BOUGHT YOUR LATEST MAKE UP MUCH LOVE 😍😍😍😍😍😍
looks so pretty but some times shein does not look good
I honestly do not like the blush and the eyeshadow colors
Lol I love it
ITS CUTE JAMESYS
You always think about yourself you don't think abot the ppl that doesnt have money.
Just cuz you are rich doesnt mean you have to be so dramatic and like ahhhhh ohhhhh noooo of cheap makeup
You are so dramatic if someone is poor and love's makeup does are the prices they Will bought
Not y’all switching so fast lmao
“let me do the cream i’ve been into that recently”
I hate him lol
Actually I have SHEIN outfits and they are cute!
The contour was invisible lol 👄😺💖💖💖
Great makeup👌
it looks better then i expected!
You better get on it
Can you please please do one from Daiso
You look amazing with the full face shiglam makeup from shein . If you didn't say it' was full-face makeup from Shein, I would not believe it's Shein. I would be happy if you could do a full face makeup with warm nude colors for everyday makeup look from shein🙏🙏🙏 I really, really liked the look ....  I believe that a full face shein makeup look with warmer colors will be no less beautiful than the blue shades.  Thank you.🙏🙏🙏♥♥♥
Beautiful and nice presentation
the look was good but I felt is the eyeshadow matched with your shirt than it would pull the look together but it looks good love it and love you
it's beautiful James 😊
Him saying SHE-IN instead of SHEIN
sheglam isn't that bad... 😭 he didn't say one good thing about it...
ok but if you didn't know it was shein. i think you would have responded better.
Why are you wearing make up you are a man not a woman😬
Do aliexpress
I literally started to laugh when he used the blue pallet and the first shade he used started to make a snowfall it looked like literal chalk🤣🤣
I like it its really pretty
Hello I love u
not the best but it's good idk
You guys should do replace  the James  Charles palette prank and see if he notices! :)
the flashback made me laugh so jard
Whyd you block me on Instagram?
I like to show it off I love your make up go get it for free
Good
me not knowing makeup and just agreeing with everything he says 😭
it could be way better but it's alright
close the classist mouth, not everyone is going to spend a fortune on makeup
Pls  do you sipe James  and lil nas
I must say James is one of the best makeup artists, no matter if it’s from shein or any other brands.. 🙌🏻
~ is it jzt me or is speaking a lot more faster now 😭
When he said:”I need better friends to watch my TikTok’s” me:I’m here😂
James you look so beautiful
Do Amazon as well
The makeup looks good ngl specially it’s nice on u duh
Jesus Christ loves you 🥺
I love your vids and I love when your yourself and inspire other people to be there self
to be honest it looks so cute in you and keep doing these videos:)))
Horrifying flashback picture you look like a marshmallow sorry but it true lol
It's cute except for the base no offense
"My crease is cut with my Salad concealer"....🥗 😅
Your videos are so funny I love them
bestie u talk to much START THE MAKE UP
good video i liked it
love ur nails
Waitttt what lashes are thoseee!!!!
U look good in everything and anything
cute makeup ❤️
For me you look amazing with that make up ♥️
I was dying when he read the concealer names 💀💀💀SALAD
I live James Charles but he talks too fast for me sometimes. Breathe sister 😩
I feel like James Charles is super picky about his make up but your girl still loves his YouTube channel
I learnt how to do my makeup at 9 years old thanks to you James keep up the good work 👍👍😁😁👍👍😁😁👍👍😁😁👍👍😁😁👍👍😁😁👍👍
love it😆😆
can u please review sace lady products. it is known for being very affordable and has good products. they are also known for their full coverage concealers and long lasting eyebrow products. alot of people love them here in asia
I think his makeup always looks good because he’s experienced and knows how to use makeup correctly, but the product can still be bad quality and used well
I like this it looks good
It's nice, but then again probably bad for your skin. Please stop hurting your skin James if you don't want to. Aslo everyone don't support shein its Fast Fashion and in a way modern slavery. Workers don't get paid enough for the hard work they do.
Too fine
On my way to buy that puffy glitter thing
What ever make up he puts on he makes it look good like how I can get good makeup and I look terrible
Don’t want to be rude(in the nicest way possible) I strongly dislike it
well u get points on shein for rating it good lol so we rate evrything 5 or 4 stars
Tbh, I thought that the eye shadow look was very creative, and the lipstick and the blush could've been a little better but hey, you tried your best and that's all that matters. Just trying to look out for you sister. I love your channel and I hope you see this. Have an amazing day sister!
Ok. I hear you with the formula. But their lashes are great and love the lip oils
Why is it so hard to believe that the ratings are genuine? Most of them are verified buyers and SHEIN is that girl✨ most cheap makeup is better than higher end anyways.
L
hey sisterrrrrr
wtf is this 💀
it ok but is your denim
You should do Walmart to make up
I counted the amount of times he air quouted.....🤭
it looks good! but pls stop badhing shein just bc it's not your fancy make up lol not everyone can have that
Well the products isn’t that good but your talent makes it perfect
'SHEIN is extremely popular, but also very controversial as well...'  mans describing himself
He looks like Dua Lipa
Is it just me or do the brushes look like morphie brushes????????
Jesus loves you so much!❤
as much as i don’t wanna watch james’ videos, i’m really curious about the quality of shein’s makeup
Omg salad as a concealer name! It got me cracking up 😂
The look was OK I think it would be better if the shirt matched
I like high exposure makeup so when he said the powder was ghostly I really did consider it
My friend at school she has a shein jacket
It is very cool and creative!!!!
Love the blouse.
Okay that warning is nothing be afire of lmao a law California passed almost everything says that, even all fast food places and even random things that aren’t food or beauty
Recite kalma Shadat for accepting ISLAM & Obey the rules of Islam to achieving you own HEAVEN also forgiveness from ALLAH at the time of Judgement Day spread this Message to Others. According to PROPHET MUHAMMAD PEACE BE UPON HIM.
you look gorgas!  lol ik i  spelled that wrong
Ngl, this was pretty nice for SHEIN and it was better than my going out makeup.
I was expecting a lot worse to be honest
That’s stunning james
So all of you guys say that shein makeup are dangerous , ok fine , but are you sure 100% that other makeup brands are safe too , be honest , you don't even have the reasons to say that shein makeup are dangerous , there are so much other brands out there that killing animals for test , why you all don't talk about their companies like loreal , maybaline and other famous brands ???? Be honest okay
Love the ear rings
you should do a target one
I love SHEIN-  Their clothing anyways-
I’m ngl this is amazing for shien
Why do you do makeup when your a boy???
I love it
Can I have a video of u showing all the product u have and like which one u use more. and I'm also curious, where do u put all the bad product u use? do you just throw them or what?!
I think he can pull this look off 😅
salad dressing lmao
I mean shein sorry
Its good,make up i Wonder stein is the best make up company
This makeup is horrible for me
Shein uses child labor
the makeup was amazing in my oppinioun
It’s not bad BUT the shimmer glitter thing just ruins it I mean 6/10 not bad
Sister slayyyyyssss any makeup brand Swear to god
Your makeup 💄  is so good  and you are a makeup artist 🎨 Jame
It is not bad , yeah
Me who doesn't know how to do makeup- James your make-up is damn beautiful broo
he's giving a rude vibe i dunnu but hate his attitude
It’s looks good like I personally wouldn’t spen 100$ on shin makeup in the first place but for she in and heir prices just for funzies I would
I love it 🥰
You look gorgeous honestly love the makeup I have tried all their makeup was good but I don’t like the eyeshadow and eyebrows wax
James Charles can make every makeup look good
the look itself was 8/10 but i  guess that is  because you are a professional makeup artist and if it was given to  an amateur  it would be a mess so the makeup itself would be a six out of 10
Everytime I watch James's videos after watching others, I feel like I speed on 2x.Really fast talking haha   ( Eng is not my native language )
Your weird
Its pretty good tbh
Hey ich bin ein kleiner Youtuber aus Deutschland und werde demnächst auch ein Sheglam Makeup Video hochladen, schaut gerne vorbei, würde mich sehr freuen 🙈
its pronounced shine but spelt shein
Hi
Bro AliExpress next
He should start buying the products instead of his team
Bro this dudes team be dooming him with the shittiest products
NEVER BUY OF THERE IT IS RUBBISH
Primarks makeup
Nice video
I think that the highlighter was not pretty but the eyes where pretty good I have to say
hate how he's dragging sheglam and calling it shein, I've used it and it's real good
You look great James you’re beautiful inside and outside
Is it just me or anyone else thinks that james nose looks so unrealistic I love the glow on the nose...
it looks so good james
Why don’t you start a makeup brand way as cheap as shein and also as good quality as you were expecting.. the truth is you get what you paid for. So foolish of you to expect chanel like quality in 5 dollar product.
Its okay but I could see why you say it doesn’t look good and the foundation and stuff where pinch and didn’t look good I like the eye shadow Color but the pinch lip stick was pretty
اسرع شخص يتكلم😵‍💫
full face of aliexpress
Do fashion nova makeup
the products are ok but you make it look amazing sister
34:45 má ơi cười xĩu khúc này

The SHEIN makeup actually looks good
That lipstick was actually SO PRETTY
I LOVE your intro
He looks better with shien makup then his James Charles makup I love shien and I don’t like the fact your disrespting them
Yo creo que no se esforzó en hacer el maquillaje bien! Solo por ser de SHEIN 👀
i think the highlight just made you look SUPER oily
i found yo lil bro :skull:
Makeup is for women only.
I think the eyeshadow look is fine just the way eyeshadow product was awful.
I feel like shein deletes the bad reviews coz everything there is almost always 5 stars
🤘🤟👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎🤙👎🤙🤙👎👎🤙👎🤙🤙👎👎👎🤙👎👎👎👎👎👎
do you guys say it “Sheen or Shein”
Hi sister can u pls show us your makeup collection
Yay 😊
Its relly good but The blue dont get me it would be Nice If you had purpule or pink as
Pleaaase do one on a dark skin
Um bitch really said in all 48 states but in California like um sir I think you ment in all 49
James: I think I need better friends

So cool I love shein is was fun to watch keep going 🥰your amazing 😁🤪😂🤪🥰😍😍😍😍
Ur eyes 👀👀REEEED!!🙌🏼❤️
It looks really pretty 🤩
Him: fumbles to pronounce tge words. Me being science student: Rolls off tongue like it's nothing
forgot the setting spray😃
Shein sucks btw
he’s only complaining cause it’s from Shein 🤦🏻‍♀️
Listen James, you are talented, if I were to give you sand and  mix that sand in food colouring you do makeup with  that  you would still look amazing.
I mean it's not that bad so....
It looks fab
It actually looks pretty good
Why do u look like a whole square bru
The blush was a bit too much maybe should of tried a lighter blush for your skin tone but overall it was good
Stop making videos
მოგიტყან დინოზავრი დედის ტრაკი
maybe it's not the make up? maybe it's the "artist"....
You should do a Tesla picks my makeup vid that would be great! Btw love this vid!💗
Pls do a full face of make up on Andrew Davila.
If people in Indian start doing the same type of make-up as him(James) then I'mma be going in every single wedding
Firstly, JAMES LOOK STUNNING IN EVERY LOOK 😭❤️ . Now being honest , being a makeup artist & make-up enthusiast, i see the points that James pointed out and have used a few shein makeup products (which were a gift from my aunt , cuz in india shein is banned ...so she gifted me a makeup set ) i honestly agree to James on so many levels and i generally am a budget friendly person, so yeah... few of their products are good , but few i genuinely don't like , especially their blush pigment , it's not it. But honestly it's not bad. It's okay , few products are good and few are okay.
And because the items are cheap but high rated you think that’s wrong..?
THEY DONT STEAL DESIGNS THE SELL IT CHEAPER OR RE CREATE IT AND SELL IT CHEAPER SO PEOPLE CAN AFFORD THE STUFF BECAUSE SOME OF US CANT AFFORD EXPENSIVE STUFF
😍👏🏻
Shein is a fast fashion brand that exploits cheap labour and heavily pollutes the environment, we don’t support them
Shine is one of the great shopping apps that I use but I stop using it because there was a necklace that was supposed to be Satanism but it had a Nazi logo on it-
I love it
it is so cute
face it yall james looks good in anything and everything !!! love u sister <333
I HATE Shein. Like I am so sorry, but I hate how their company steals designs not from mainstream companies but also from aspiring designers.
I shop at shein all the time and for that I got a free bag it's really cool!
i mean i am not a professional makeup artist so i dont need anything too special and shein helps anyways thank you james
I really liked this look honestly any makeup looks good on you ❤
Can u do all cover girl makeup plz
Love your shirt
We need a video where you blindly compare Shein and a high end makeup brand
do a full face with Miss A {that is a brand}
Hi sister
Literally what the hell you complain so much bro it’s so nice and high quality and affordable for people who can’t buy high end makeup 🙄
I’m sorry but it annoys me how he says SHEIN bc i am so used to saying shEEn
I actually use their foundation. It’s the only one that really works for my skin. And I love it. You should of tried their liquid blush. A lot of people use that from them.
The reason why people give a 5 stars review is because Shein gives you more points when you give high ratings.
yo look GORGEUS
TRY REVOLUTION NEXT!!
Хай систееерс

You talk too much
This is not it
omg love the videoooooooooo but that makeup product is scaryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
It's actually pretty for it being shein!
bruhhh I don’t know why I can’t see any makeup on Shein☹️ just tools. does anyone know why??
it looks fineeeeeee
This is the first time I see a video of u n I loved the way u make up n ur way of being very funny ☺️, u got a new subscriber here ☝🏼by the way, I loved ur morphe palette which I have ❣️
*cough* not me looking at this thinking it is the most professional makeup i have seen. Also okayyy perioddd james you literally pull off anything love you<333333
I loved this video! I actually use SHEIN!
I mean it’s not the best look you’ve done but for being so cheap I mean it’s pretty good alternative for people who can’t or don’t want to spend much
Well it kinda looks good, buying some cheap staff and buying some drug store and high end make up together as a mix will do the best jobs but not all cheap you know…
JAMES to be honest its not BAD
Oohh my gooood he speak very faaaaassst
It looks really good!!!!! It’s just the blush that’s throwing me off!
روح تداوي ماخصناش هاد لخنز نشوفوه
SHEIN is known for clothes not makeup
Jesus loves you
I really like your video you are very confident too and talented
You always look so good even if you don't like it I do it's sooooooo good
James, PLEASE, do a video using make-up products by brazilians influencers! Like Bruna Tavares, Boca Rosa, Niina Secrets, Mari Maria Makeup, Fran by FR
James, PLEASE, do a video using make-up products by brazilians influencers! Like Bruna Tavares, Boca Rosa, Niina Secrets, Mari Maria Makeup, Fran by FR
I am not a fan
i love you daddy
Babe , seriously though it does look good . Gorg
Omgosh his face
Os produtos me pareceram bons
I accept it James it's really giving the glam in the way I expected but l learner the way of many techniques and got many tips at choosing a product ☺️☺️☺️☺️
Love it
I’m sorry did he just say the ingredients in his palette aren’t safe for your eyelids lol
OMG!  I am 9 years old and I love you so much!!!!!!!!!! you look amazing!!
Its amazing
the reviews are real tho
can you do a full daily budget friendly makeup toutorial
" lets do both "" slay
i loveeee you're makeup james.
The reason they have all good reviews is because when you give something stars and rate you get points which can take money off your order when make a lot
The makeup turned out good, his just shading the brand cause its not expensive
De donde ere?🥰
I love  your  makeup
honestly looked good but it depends on the quality of the products
You look so pretty
Im just being my whole shopping on SHEIN and my friend too
You talk so so fast I swear! I like the lipstick 💄
It was fine but not the best I love ur makeup videos
Bro is dissing SHEIN when his nails looks like he got them from SHEIN i shouldnt of comented or watvhed this bc its promotes him and i dont promote child predators but wtv hate you james :)
It’s the sun rays😂😂😂😂
I love SHEIN its so cheap yet so good
OMG I WANT TO BE IN YOUR VIDS!!!!!!!! U LOOK SOOOOOOO PRETTY 😍
It looks good
Honestlyyyyy- from Shein-  thats really good..
Can you please try products from Kiko Milano? It´s my favorite <3 <3 <3
she-in💀
i 😫😫😩😩😩😩😩 4 U
literally the only person I know that has shit on this make up brand, he was reaching from the start to say something negative
its good but i can see the pores were he did he's concealer but not bad
I like the way your lips looked after the lipstick but that’s about it for SHEIN makeup. I honestly think you have a beautiful complexion so when you start adding the bronzer to your forehead and nose it starts looking like too much make up! But that’s just my opinion! I love that your videos are so upbeat and appreciate you showing us these products so I don’t waste my money!
how did i end up here
Do full face of Amazon makeup
It looks good
Lol one time I got a mushroom sweater from shein
I actually rly like it
The skinn😻❤️
Why do you speak so fast?
It looks pretty good😗💜️
okay the lipstick ruined the look to be honest
Be man.
Are you man or woman?😁
Sup
I only bought a eyeliner from Shein and it was the best eyeliner I ever had. I cried and slept with that eyeliner on and it didn't move an inch form where I put it. Girls/Boys/Everyone if you have a spare 3 dollars go get it
It’s cute for being from SHEIN. I did not like how the foundation started lifting and how the powder was super light even after spreading it out. All in all I think it’s really cute and If I was you I would wear it out.🥰🥰
aah i LOVE your Tshirt
the makeup looks normal
👍🏻
Still you should get the same Mickey Mouse Morphy set I’ve seen YouTube videos it’s supposed to be like really good I’m a very good make up person but I only have eyeshadow palette so you should do a full face of make enough Marcy
You should try using a Mickey Mouse Morphy palette it has more pigmented colors I got one for Christmas and I’m nine years old
its alright
WAIT WHAT DOES HE MEAN ABOUT DUNE! THAT MOVIE IS GOATED 😭
i like shein
omg i got a really cute hoodie on shein and they gave it to me in the wrong size
Love how he expects bad rezultāts just because it doesn't cost $20+ like not qll cheaper stuff is trash
Everything looks good on you James!!
not gonna lie, the lipstick looks bomb asf
It looks soooooo bad
yaaaaaaaaaaassssss queen

i was doubtful, but this look really looked gorgeous in the sun ☀️!! <3
Not everyone has extra money to buy expensive stuff. Shein is my to go idc💗
Make makeup out food
Personally I hate the look I love James but noooo it’s just I don’t have any words to explain it but princesses barbie
Don’t underestimate SHEIN
the reason why it’s 5 stars is because we’re just too lazy to change the stars rating. When you do rating, it’s 5 stars already but you can change the rating of course—but i don’t change it at all ‘cause im just too lazy to do it
The way he speaks spikes my cortisol
LMFAO 15:27
Now you gotta do aliexpress
I like it and it is also from shein so give yourself a break james
👼🏿😇😇😇🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻✝️✝️✝️👼🏿👼🏿
the fact his eyes were bloodshot at the end-
It looks soo good
Shein has good makeup type. He just acted too much in the video saying it bad 😒😂 dumb
This is all I’m going to say 👍💄👑✨💅
“HI SISTERS”💀💀
It looks amasing I think ur second guessing it because of ur shirt
Omg yassss queen
I love shopping and shien
Girl it’s bad and good

I love makeup!
What shade was the foundation?
I love u James Charles
I would love to see you try and put a nice colour look together using different colour story palettes
TBH shein make up products are better than kylie's
Eee sharmanda. Uyal yurishingdan
Man this man talks tooo much and too fast! Shit.
James I Love it
What you mean flashback?
you should try SHOP MISSA, the online makeup dollar store
James someone said something really rude about you and I reported them because I love you sister and you don’t deserve the negativetea
It look go form sein
Omg James it’s okay I will give it an 9/10
James, you made it look good on you❤️ on me it would look terrible
the blush is what threw it off
It’s ok 👌
It was 100% the sponge taking off the foundation and concealer, I am very careful with sponges & brushes !! I had my Lancome foundation come off BECAUSE of the sponge I used. It has nothing to do with the foundation or concealer but the sponge.
Yeah but james can do anything makeup look great
This is my first time watching one of your vids , to be honest your personality and approach came across as rude and obnoxious.  You appear to be somewhat of a snob .  To be fair , based on the price point of the SHEIN products I thought they did their job , can you purchase better of course and also worse .
It’s rly nice James love ur vids should do a lot more of these vids xxx
It looks beautiful james don't doubt it it looked fine ❤️🥰
Can u just stop cuz literally shein makeup is good and ive been trying it for a while and a lot of people ask me abt my make up i bet you’ll not say those things if those products weren’t from shein
OMG LOVE IT SO BEAUTIFUL 😊😄
I actually just ordered a bunch of makeup from Shein so I decided to just randomly watch some reviews to see what other people think. Honestly, it's some of the best quality makeup I have ever tried.
OMG your hair is so cute
you is so cool i like yo makeup
bestie you should do a “ wearing shein for 24hrs” that would be a better review
its amazing its not that bad
i luv how James is literally complaining how cringy the names of the shades are when one of his shades in his palette is literally DADDY
Why didnt you get shein lashes
god you are so cute
I always think about how me and  James are born on the same day and year..... its so funny.. I'm also a triplet so thats fun haha
i think it looks good
You actually look good
I think this look is actually pretty good
You or amazing 👏 😉 at mature
Are you e boy or a girl
The salad concealer 😂😂😂
PSA😭 remember to use your primer and foundation in the same base like if your primer is water based use a water based foundation or if your primer is oil based make sure your foundation is oil based too or else your makeup will lift and it won’t blend right :)
i like your nails!
the blush ruined it
I loveeeeeeee make up from u. I mean shein is completely fine and good 💖💖💖
It’s a no from me 😭😭
get shein lashes some of them are actually really really good
I understand y'all are the experts, I am not. I only watch James Charles videos bc his commentary/his personality. Althought I think why the products didn't work well together was because when you think about shein/wish, it's supposed to be affordable so you need less products. For instance maybe only do one thing on the face: concealer, glow whatever stick, crappy foundation, then less color with the eye shadows and not  both lip stick and lip gloss. Just not made for full blown artistry. Have to say though, I did love the lip stick before the gloss. :-)
they have all 5 stars on everything because they try to take down all of the 4 star reviews and lower but if you look enough you can find people putting 5 star bad reviews so they don't take it down.
James if you were wearing a different shirt then the look, would look great.
Do you like BTS💜
YOU LOK PRETTY I WILL GIVE YOU A 12/10
He's just used to rich products that's if it's cheap but does the same job as the expensive one,he just can't except  that some of the cheap one is actually a 5 star product
Hi  WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL
Glad u stopped talking about dune before u decided to get more hate then usual
Man’s shirt even looks like it was pulled off of shein.
Not gonna lie it looks great
I think James Charles did the makeup really good
I HATE HIM
Your face turned out so good!
Its ok 👍
nice video
Sister slaying u look fantastic James like always u pull of anything
I really quite like
Honestly the make up look doesn’t look bad the eyes are terrible but everything else looks really nice
I hope you're okay I love your videos
Why do I feel he is full of hate from the beginning before he tries the product 😅
The fact that the makeup he did from shein is better than my everyday makeup 💄
me searching on shien for makeup then seeing this video also me: damn they really be stalkin
Omg your intro is so amazing ✨
Okay but it was giving until the blush😭
I got your pallet for Christmas and I'm in LOVE!
try out shein's chroma collection! i think the colors are wayyyy too good
i always sang the U  G L Y u have got no alloby
yes but the product could be WAYYY better
Great job 😂 but with your products it would be better
I need part 2 sis…
It looks so good 👍
Edit so nice
Actual People leave reviews not just randoms
Not gonna lie he is just being a hater because this was actually really pretty 🤩 ❤️🥰
SALAD?!
be thankful😒
You look really good. N the makeup looks good too!
Do euphoria themed makeup !
“It’s the sun rays” hahahaha that guy needs more appearances in your vid’s he’s hilarious
Maybe you should try the most expensive make up from shein cuz i know shein has some really good products
James chill you look good asf
I love your outfit 💚
The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up Matthew 11:5  Whom the Son sets free is free indeed. John 8:38  For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life. John 3:16  Receive Jesus as your savior today
I like some clothing from shien
Is it just me who thinks the makeup looks fine 😭
listen de sun sculp liquid contour is good
It’s like James is literally bashing SHEIN makeup for no reason… the blush was there, and he chose the worst combo for eyeshadows 🙄 but oh well…
IT LOOKS SO PRETTY!
REPENT AND TURN TO JESUS
DOES ANYONE KNOW WHERE HIS SHIRT IS FROM???
DO ALL MAKEUP FROM MISS A
That foundation looks like Navidadas foundation
Honestly everything looks pretty on you
Seems to come across as super snobby… 🤷‍♀️
U look so prettyyyy
It was super good
I really think you look beautiful definitely going to try next 🥰
My Nancy has those brushes
Hello hi I'm sure you from Jamaica I see you do a lot of makeup son I love your makeup and do you do your face all the time so I'm a person that's just starting and I don't know how to do make her up so can you teach me first time on your program
U NEED TO DO A VID TRYING AMAZON MAKEUP

MATERIAL GWOORL THATS PERFECT
What about Ulta Beauty?
It look very good
I like it and I wish you could do that for me
It looks amazing and I wish you could do that for my sister
I'm really interested in buying makeup from Shein because of the prices but the Prop 65 warning really does scare me😭
yeah, no. He's right. it's not good.
Wow ❤️❤️ you are beautiful James ☺️😍
its niceeeeeeeee........ yuh lol
If I would be honest I think it’s good but other then the acne u will have , next morning
It's not good but your face made it pretty 🤍

shiny forehead
🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
do people still like him?
the makeup was pretty fine considering its from SHEIN😅👍
I like it and actually shows up in camera well. The blue eyeshadow and pink  blush is just not a vibe. The look was good just not the concept.
No offense that Eyeshadow looks like it was done by me I’m terrible at eyeshadow
James Charles ur the gayest guy I’ve seen I can’t tell if ur trans or not thats how bad and screwed up it is
Did u get ur shirt from shien too sister??
Honestly if he was wearing a different top that matched the eye makeup that look would have been on point
Kenny you meik a video with ameson 👑😙🦋🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Ana
"Salad" concealer was everything!! 😂
Looks good!!
Loving the into!!🙃❤️
Hi

The kettle 🤣💀💀 06:10
Hi  James Noel's  Sorry for the  late  for  this Noel's  but  can you please do  dollar  store 🙏
I'm gonna buy the matte foundation and see how it goes
You should do a guessing if it’s shein or original brand challenge
I love this
do one from amazonnnnnnnnnn
I’m not gonna lie it’s hideous
I love the look
rejectly modernity,embrasing strongly
It looks gorge
Heaven and hell are real turn to God
"Right in front of my salad!" -- I've seen that video clip before somewhere else 💀
Not sure about these products lol
U kinda sound like those spoiled girls 😂😂
I liked it all except for the eye shadow
The only thing that’s distracting me from Roblox
Ελλάδα
James plz why you tallk so faaaast 😳
😁😁😁
Hello im new
I review the clothes I get from SHEIN…. They are  real people
I think you are very talented to make SHEIN make up look good.
I feel like one of the reasons he doesn't like the makeup is because he is so used to high-end, expensive, fancy makeup because he has money to buy expensive stuff
Try huda beauty products
When you have play the video slower because he talks too fast 😂
why the fuck are you using and promoting fast fashion
OMG can you do like re-creating your intro outfits PLEASE
When you hate a thing it will never work well with you because you hate it and this is exactly what is happening in this video like wtf I use shein makeup and everyone be like so surprised because of the looks of my makeup and they think that I did it with a makeup artist.... everyone I highly recommend buying shein ( sheglam for specific) it's so good 👍🏻
Your a QUEEN! You can even wear makeup from the dollar store and you will still look glam!
The salad concealer 😂
Okay but that eye lash curler was actually terrifying 😭
He have a great skills so the reason h he don't like this look 😂but seriously i love that ❤
lmao i got that same makeup bag off shein
Child labor <3333
SO PRETTY CHANGE AND MAKE A TIK TOK!
wassup
love
How is ur face not breaking out, I have to use special products cause my face is so sensitive
5:37, James looks…. Ghostly 😳
i know this was ages ago but i had that clear through lipgloss and it was clear might just be because of the lipstick on it?
omg idonot have any make up 😳😳😳😳😔😔😔😔😔
I heard Shein makeup is the same factory that makes colourpop and kylie makeup
1:07 LGBTQ flag?????😲🏳️‍🌈
Umm its your fault not theirs

The problem is not Shein, it's your face 🤡
The problem is not Shein, it's your face 🤡
I definitely want to try their lipsticks for that shine. Did it stay glossy or flake up or dry out?
Should have bought lashes from Shein too, they are scary
OMG!!! I LOVE UR VIDEOS SISTERRR!!

sNaTChEd ✨✨
ok James i'm going to be honest you can do better on that colour combo on the eye shadow, like girl that gold and blue is not it.
TRY A FULL FACE OF ETSY! they got interesting stuff even plant based makeup its cool af to me lol
It’s not fair that he said the two eye shadows are not  gonna look good together so why do it!!!
Its pretty. Nice 🙂
If I’m not lieing it looks fine but I don’t like it that much I don’t like the eyeshadow the other stuff looks fine
In all honesty its not bad but not a very good quality either, but I give it an overall okay review, personally the makeup colors with the shirt didn't match but other than that it looked pretty good!
No
I looovveee your nails 🤗🤗🤗
This issssssss pretty pretty 😍 love love love this
In all honesty I loved the look !!!! The reviews n the actual look spoke two different languages
DO ALIEXPRESS
James is the best and he always made me happy:)
Pretty sure if it was a high-end pricy brand you wouldn’t be complaining so much lol.
There's a pallete similar in shape to the blue one ypu have but in red color scheme that i got and i loved the formula so much  that i wanted to try all the other palletes
hey does anyone know where james got his cute lock and key earrings??
The state of California has that same warning on a sign before you go into Disneyland….
He’s lowkey hard on these products for no reason.
Hey James I’m a HUGE fan I love your videos I’ve been subbed since 2019 I love you videos my mom MIGHT (hopefully) she’s getting me the James Charles pallet I’m 8 yrs old tysm for entering us   Your inspiring to do makeup I’m HORRIBLE I mean HORRIBLE at makeup watching your videos make me try harder and do my best tysm
Rocking that turtle neck
yk not everyone is rich right
I think for the eyeshadow it's act kinda k-beauty formula. and k-palette is usually formulated not as pigmented as American palette.
I'm glad I'm not the only one who didn't like Dune lol
OMGEEEE QUEEN!! I love this Haul!!! I just did a SHEIN haul as well!! plus size edition 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥✨✨✨
Achei a maquiagem muito bonita e muitos produtos que tenho da SHEIN realmente funcionam. Gosto das maquiagens
Don’t we all just love James dissing shein when all that makeup on him looks a lot better than most of us could probably do😂
OK I can’t be the only one I thinks But this is actually kind of cute as a make up look I mean it might just be the fact it’s gone through editing and like perfect lighting and stuff but still
No hay comentarios en Español? 🥲
Firstly, You chose the wrong blush. Wrong eyeshadow palette. But still you look very pretty.
Hi

Nice
Where is your top from? Looks really nice:)
Okay the clip filmed outside was BEAUTIFUL
Eu não acho os produtos tão ruim assim , euu em
4:40 They are true. I mean I posted a lot of photo on that site. Cause it gives you points for the next purchase. So yeah they actually “pay us” giving us points for reviews, but it’s more like a choice to review or not and it’s not obviously based on what you type or what vote you give.  I’m interested into the consiler
We’re do you live James
JAMESSS INDIAN BRIDAL MAKEUP PLSSSSSS INDIAN BRIDAL MAKEUP WITH FULLL ACESSORIES YOU CAN GET EVERYTHING ONLINEEEE AND YOU HAVE GOOGLEEEEE

it’s not the makeup product, it’s the artist who uses it 💁🏻‍♀️💅🏻
HIIII SISTERSSS
james is like very pretty for no reason 🤨🧐
For shein its amazing but ur saying its bad but the only reason its good is bc you done it
Stop promoting SHEIN ✋🏼✋🏼✋🏼
i truly believe, if he didn’t know this was shein makeup and he was told this was a new higher end brand, he wouldn’t have responded so negatively
He was just overreacting to the facts that he knows twas’ from shein.
You should do a full face from 5below
Ive tried she galm eyeliner and i definitely think its 10/10!
It’s not to good but it’s ok for staying in the house
Lol it really don't look too fine lol whole he showed the eyeshadow palette I was just wishing you would not pick the blue and gold one but we'll you did lol
i love shein
Can you play ice skating ballerina by cocoplays
Do u have pink eye on both eyes?
Y do your eyes look so red????
It looks good~ 🥰
OMG I M SO GLAD I LOVE YOU IT LOOKS SO GFOOD
“Salad” 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
the sad part tho is that the amount of lead content in Shein’s clothes scares me enough to nOt try the makeup.. since China’s labor rules allow a wAy higher percentage than FDA approved concentration 💀🤚
Ngl it’s actually good
not gone lie one of my favorite makeup (blending) brushes is from shein lol
Im not gonna lie?? Why is this sausage hog so in love with salamie 🍌🍆🌶😂🤣😂🤣
I like the eye look, you look so shiny, even before the puff. Love u💜
15:52
So not gonna lie. Let me give you all a review about them their makeup is insane. I bought very less products in the start but now i am so in love with them i bought all the makeups from them for my czn who is a bride. And she fall in love.   Just a bonus point: buy SHEGLAM products the other ones are meehhh. But sheglam ones are best and pocket friendly too
PLS SHOW YOUR SKINCARE ROUTINE
can you do glowing makeup i d'ont know hiw to do makeup tutorial can you do gold and some brown tuto makeup i love it this tutorial
It looks soooooo great I like it💖
Okay it looks good but too much glitter and I really love the lip stick not the lip gloss tho.
Can we show some actual detail of the skin?
I don’t think it looks so bad 😅
this makeup look actually looks pretty good
You becoming very cynical like Jeffrey Starr these days. The old you was better, kind. Makeup reviews are not your thing.
Speaking of zendaya .... It would be sister cool to do a collaboration with her. Like ya know
shein customers are actually just lazy to rate stars when they review it, you'd mostly have to look through all the reviews to find out if a product is good or not
The dude in the back is now my spirit animal 😂
💗💗💗💗💗💗💙💙💙💙💙💙💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💙💙💙💙💙💙💗💗💗💗💗💗💙💙💙💙💗💗💗💗💗💗💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
my mum loves shein
can you please stop them bunny ears.
AM I ONLY WHO NOW THIS DAY SE NEW INTRO? 😭😂
Heyyy
i love ur shirt
Pretty
James I feel like your bashing SHEIN 😭
Love love love the zoom ins
Amazing
Hey James! If you ever order a Shein product again be aware that the good reviews are only so people can get points. Points bring coupons and make their payments cheaper than they actually are which is why people make such good reviews. Love ya! ❤️
can we PLEASEEEEE get a full face of shop miss a makeup?!?!? it’s all $1?!?! PLEASEEEEEE REVIEW THESEEEE💞💞💞💞
salad
i did know that it will come out like this it is super gold
Plsss do trying kylie Jenner makeup we neeed to see it plsss
I like it a lot just change into your outfit tell Matter and then it will be presentable enough for my brain to process
Love the makeup ❤️ wish I could bring myself to go bold with eyeshadow 😇😅😣
i feel like if they slapped an expensive big name brand on these products he would LOVE them
I don't like the blue pallet but everything else looks good I want to see the other pallet
stop promoting fast fashion on your massive platform maybe?? just to churn out content? you are literally the problem
Ti looks great 👍
It looks good wdym 😭
Shein is amazing we always order clothes and decor but they dont have the best makeup products
Its not bad but will not try after watching this
i love that eyeshadow combo : /
WAY too much shimmer. It looks sweaty :(
slay sister
Not bad she in
Not to be mean but the outside look was looking like SpongeBob not going to lie
I love my Shein eyeshadows ❤️
James foundation match has been getting better
🥰
Amazon
no...no nononnonononono love you but i was horrified. and don't endanger your skin!
Lmao everything was cute besides the eyeshadow look
Wrong products !!
Salad is such an odd choice of names for a concealer lol
hey james! so, as i am watching this im playing this really fun game called makeup artist. so i think it would be so cool if you did a video where you tried to re create the looks on this app!
Yasss it looks sooo good
James you forgot setting spray
That warning for the birthday skin thing was on the back of my bookcase— what a small world 😋😋
WAITTTT NO IT LOOKS PRETTY GOOD BESIDES THE BLUSH
Salad reaction😂😂😂
“RiGhT iN fRoNt Of My SaLaD” anyone else know where that scene is from before this…. 😂😂😂
I LOVE you james charles good youtube wow 3,809,087 and subscribe 24.4m love you james
It looks good!!!
i love your vids you are amazing
The reviews are obviously to get points like a coupon and brings down the price you pay
James where did u get that shirt
Honestly.. I’m not mad 😂
Kusra
u should do a goth make up vid reacting or putting on the make up
I used to like you but I don’t eny more your just evil
I love videos like this but he just talks too much and too fast
Did anyone notice as soon as it hit like near minute 11 in the video, his lips got like super red or is that just me? I may be hallucinating cuz im tired but tell me im wrong if I am lol
Don't know about the products but you are looking beautiful ❤
OMG SISTER JAMES I LOVE THE SHIRT ❤️
I feel like he is just hating, it looks good 💁🏻‍♀️
It literally looks fine
She’s high
🤮🤮🤮🤮
I am loving the new intro!!  🥰
just bc u can adored  expensive  make up  i think its fine and  bigger  influencers love it and the facked u can still poste is baffilling
That’s freaking gorgeous
not me putting the cream lipstick in my cart
For Christmas my mom got me a James Charles pallet
It was very pretty
That looks good. I just notice your eyes kinda red? if you do  not like the products send it to me hahah 🤣😂
Whyyy it looks good
I feel like sometimes things look ok for us to others but others don’t feel ok. I feel you James 😭 but you look amazing
I love it it doesn’t matter the brand, it’s the hands that create the art *_*
do make up products from amazon prime
Don’t support Shein. Please look into it. Modern slavery, child labor and the list goes on😓 With every dollar you put into this stuff you support alls of what was mentioned prior. Do your research!
You always looks amazing sister!!♥️  Only you could pull stuff like this off ♥️
Can u do a natural look pls xx
i lovvveee the eye shadow combo it looks soooo cute i love the color combo but the shirt definitely dont match thats just me -\_(:3)_/-
Idk how but the eyeshadow palettes color changed when james took off the cover at 12:39 am I blind huh
I’m 6 seconds into the video and I already love his outfit
he has female face a pretty one
u should try a full face of make up from shopee
You can get lashes from SHEIN to
I like it
the makeup look is okay but if it were your makeup and the eyeshadow and that powder that u used at the end it would be stunning.
Stop hating on shein
ما ادري على ايش شايف نفسه الادمي ذا !

блин он реп читает😩
Oh my God !!  James Charles can Transform all Shein Reputation !! I love you james ❤️💋💞😍
My oldest daughter purchases products from SHEIN, very often.  And, for the most part, she is extremely pleased with the items she receives.  But (and it's a pretty big 'but'), she has never tried the cosmetics.  So, I forwarded this video to her.....to see what she thinks.
Todo te queda excelente mor
Omg Same james I can relate
You look bad  every  time
Do Five Below!
im a huge simp notice me senpai
Hi sisters
Olta
the makeup doesn’t look as bad as i thought but his eyes look like me after i finish smoking
hii im new to the family and cant wait to watch more the look was okay but not the best
why are you even still posting ☠️
It’s meh
The thing was that confused me was when James said that he didn't like the eyeshadow combow blue and gold because it didn't match the top , it was you who chose to were blue and gold but at the end of the day i thought it looked great and better than what ive got at home which is your makeup  pallet
I love how james moves his hand left, right up, down😃
I think it looks gr8…but you need to wear a different outfit if ur going to have that makeup 😂
It’s not that bad for shein
What you wear on your nails?is it red henna that  indian wears during wedding?
OMG james U  should do pennys makeup a full face of it
we can buy it on digital market like amazon but we use shopee
well here in phillippines we can buy make up just using 10 dollars
Salid❤😂
SHIEN isn't even that bad 💀 it's just not $1000 worth. Just because it's rlly cheap doesn't mean the quality has to be bad 😭
I like it ,it looks good in the sun
Do a full face from walmart
i like really like it
it looks awesome what the heck are you talking about!
It’s not she N it’s shean
Plz try h&m makeup
Honestly shein would look good for the "perfect skin" people who just use small products like mascara, or eyeliner. with a bit of highlighter and maybe blush. Shein just DOES NOT work for makeup LOOKS. but it's not too bad.
SALAD 😂
The makeup look is gorgeous!
I love it James I don't get why you don't like it if I'm honest but it's your opinion so I can't hate on that
The makeup was really pretty😊😊😊
I have the app Shias
Why is everyone yelling SHEIN and not putting shein  .-.
I liked the eyeshadow look on its own
Me dressed head to toe from shein like 😬
It looks good
idk shi abt makeupso this looked goold
I kinda liked this but, i don't think the eyeshadow and the top goes together
Actually..I lowkey love it
Is that a ring on his wedding finger??
You should try out the fashionova maven beauty makeup line
ITS CUTE
The orange from that pallette was picked by you <3 its not there fault to put it there :/ ugh , this was so over dramatic
James Charles you are a boy
dumd
I’m not lieing James is pregnant
James! Where did you get that shirt? I love! 💖
I actually came here to see if it was worth getting the foundation and I didn’t really get too much feedback on the particular foundation. But I’ve heard really great things about their eyeshadow palettes and their brushes. So I guess the only way to find out is to just get what I want from this company and do it myself. But thank you for showing me some decent products
its looks so good in the sun
in the last few minutes of the video he looks so high😭 chemicals getting to you babe?
love it
Please do o we full face of makeup because I’m skeptical to buy pls
We going full coverage today lol 🤣
i like it just the eyeshodow colors that u chose arent giving
i love your nails those are so pretty
To literally the 1% that is reading this, god bless you, stay safe and have a wonderful day and/or night
SALAD
and you makeup was great queen<3 like pop off even when you get shitty makeup you make it work
i wonder if oyu could do a how to do makeup for beginners and like recommend cheap but good products im 13 and want to start wearing makeup
I am not gonna lie but I kinda hate James but literally SHEIN IS FRIKIN THE BEST BC MY SISTER USES SHEIN ALL THE TIME SO ITS LEGIT THERE CLENSER DOES NOT GIVE ME JAMES FACE WITH OUT MAKEUP 💄 BUT I AM SO SORRY SHEIN GET A LIFE JAMES
I think it looks good but you need to change into a blue and gold\yellow shirt and it would look really good!!
james your being dramatic.. its so cute
So I really like the end product but I did not like the brushes Bc when u when putting the eyeshadow I felt like the brush hair was about to like break if h know what I mean. And the highlight it’s pretty but I feel like it would look prettier if it was like if little more creamy and less chunky and u are the one who’s trying it so u tell us how it feels but other wise it looks good
shein wow
When I was watching this video I was doing  my makeup  with sheins products
Do a full face of Addison Rae's makeup line
I like it 😍
I have lots of little boys for you James…. I heard they are heterosexual aswell.😳😳😳😳is that to your liking?
Ok but like can we have a skin care routin pls your skin 🤩
12:00
like  am i the only one that taught the makeup was beautiful bestie just have to change to matching outfit and it would be perfect
I think the rest of the look was fine but the blush and the eyeshadow was just no...
I’m dieing if love I LOVE YOUR MAKEUP! LOVE YOUR VIDS!
Not to shabby James! It looks good and love these types of videos!
i think the eyeshadow threw it off with ur shirt and the opposite colors on ur eyes just didn't look right. overall its really not bad whatsoever for shein but under the eyes i agree with u on that it wasn't looking right but overall 7/10
im not a karen  and I'm a big fan of James Charles but buying from shein is supporting child labor
hi james im a big fan
James, you said you need better friends.... pick me ill watch them Luv you sister😍😍
This was a really funny video to watch
Their things are rated 5 stars so they can be the top rating but it’s not real
"My crease is cut, with my salad concealer."
i’m just saying what he did was wrong buttttt he said sorry
15:59 I HAVE THE SAME PALLETTE JAMES
Yes
Ok so, I literally just starting watching u again. And sis. Your intro be cuteeee
can you try a full face from walmart
James I just got your pallet for Christmas and I need to know how to use it can you do a video pls?💗
James charls is a great make up artist he has a lot of hate let's appreciate how much he does for us
Omg please do a full face of make up from Amazon
The sheglam blush is really good I haven’t finished the video so idk if you used it but the blush recently became popular
no
Give your life to christ commenters
why y'all still watching james charles
ok just gotta say, love the nails James👏
I feel like you couldve really ate if you wore this with a blue outfit. Even then tho the look isnt half bad for it being from shien. I like it!
Thank you for see things we cannot see, I like the final look knowing you did your best so it doesn't look bad.
E
James, "ooohh this is NOT what you want" Me, "that looks better than any of my makeup jobs on myself". Also, can I just say that your natural look gives me nostalgic Molly Ringwald vibes.
your applying is amazing I can tell it was cheap
No offense it is not good
Listen u did ur work after all good but products were of bad quality and the way u do with good quality make up is different from this one
Congratulations for 2million
Can we use it for every day
i use the eyelash curler with the comb, prolly the best lash curler i’ve ever owned 💀💀
It’s givingggg
😡😡
You are beautiful 😍
I think the look is fine but change the top then it would look even better.
It was great what are you talking about
You have to make a foundation I would buy it so quick
Блин в русской озвучке вырезают мемыы
Wat’ay sausage hog😅😂🤣
on this honey oh honey just no   no nononono
Omg so good! keep up the great work  james  i order all my makeup from SHEIN to lol
Walmart
You should try a full face of makeup from Walmart
I love shein, addicting to look on what they have in store, not the best quality but really cute stuff and in the decor stuff looks really pretty and omg the clothes can be just ADORABLE
It does not look that good
It does not look good
It’s not for me . I don’t like it
You are so handsome that everything looks good
I'm with James, this was not good 😂
elf foundation is 4.99 and it works great
I think it look pretty good and SHEIN have good makeup I try some makeup and i am ready to jin the family.
I think everyone can agree that James talks to much.😅
Looks realy nice
I love James Charles
His face literally said : " I don't wanna be here " in 15:31
Wtf it's a dude
C’mon i love their makeup it feels light and lasts for so long
the shade of the eye shadow just aint doin it for me and the bronzer is just shit
omg omg
lol
Hey James I am insecure about the way I look and I have depression because of the way I look and what people think about me and you help me cope so stay positive 😁👍
the amount of times he used air quotes wrong just in the very beginning. good job james, but chill.
ehh its okay ig but not the best
Ok - the blushes and hilighters from Shein SLAP! They don't give you acne and they actually sit beautifully on the cheeks - eyeshadows are a hit or miss and you don't want to get any of these products in your eyes.
Tbh shein makeup honestly works well for me especially being that I have extremely dry skin I find that it works more for me but certain makeup doesn’t work for everyone
I know James has made it super clear that he has yellow under tones but I am for some reason I am convinced he has pink undertones...
Is it just me or is he using WAY to many black memes?
I only just get cases from SHEIN
James saying how bad they are  Me going to buy them anyway cuz the are really good
It being from SHEIN could be worst
You really look pretty in this look.....it's not that bad it's totally okay
The eyes look good not sure about everything else
-hello ily so much and you are the only reason i love to do makeup ily 🎊
Can you pls do a hole video with the SHEGLAM -TIE DYE FOR palette- plssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
Which do you think was better shein Or wish?
Very nice vedio👌 and very bootyfull makeup👌
James dressing for the age range he’s trying to attract…
You're anyways gonna look beautiful in anything james 💗  These bad products cannot win against your beauty 🛐
imagine being able to afford any makeup brand u want and still giving ur money to Shein..
Actually the makeup is fine and all but the hilighter kinda ruined it all of the stuff looked good on him tbh
Its honestly pretty good considering its frim SHEIN!
Part 2
Hi
They put toxic chemicals in their products and they underpay/mistreat my workers
ok but i use the contour stick everyday and i love how it looks on me
🃏
Not gonna lie I never liked shein
I honestly checked if my playback speed was normal
YOUR NAILS THO! 😍
Hi James would you like to try swedish cosmetics products of skincare routine and makeup products too and make honest review about the oriflame Sweden European cosmetics company's products    please do reply and make  a video on all the products while using it.
Ok but he needs to stop being insuceer I mean come on he is like fr one of the most drop dead gorgeous human being I've ever seen
Wouldn’t it be funny if they bought a knock off James Charles palette for him to try?
Ok it’s not that good
it   looks     good
omg I love this video I love you James Marry me right now;0
New intro
i think is not that bad in camara bt only james knows how it looks in reality
It looks actually really pretty but it just looks funny because of your top
i was legit about to buy it i needed this thankuuuuu
Not going to lie it's really good for SHEIN
please don't buy from stein James
Beautiful blue 😍💙
And also shein uses child labor. Good one James.
It looks great I mean it’s better then we could probably do
i think shien is good because people who re struggling with money can get stuff for cheap
try chi chi it is quite good
GUYS please stop buying from shein they are so bad for the environment and are unethical please stop
You are so much better than me at makeup.
its gdd
i dont really like james but this is nice
Как он быстро говорит.. ваау
this look is one of the best  it could be worst
I actually like it… it looks pretty good. But I don’t really do makeup I just like your vids. But I like it.
Yes
You make anything work!
Me: doing my makeup while watching your video and using YOUR PALLET
James, can you please do a full face makeup from primark 🤞🤞
each time I see his videos each time he puts more blush until he looks like hello kitty
Obviously shein makeup can't be compared with other high end makeup brands bt ig its not bad for a middle class avg girl who cant always afford luxe brands bt loves makeup...i mean it isnt that baddd....or is it?😂😅
SALAD 💀
I mean it look good far away but maybe it look bad close up
wats is shein i love shein no is much hate pleace is real so not cute but noooo
It is a little like white under eyes but the highlighters is like really chunky but I mean it’s pretty good for a off brand store from online so I think it’s decent I wouldn’t say it’s good but I think it’s OK
the makeup was pretty good especially as they were from shein!
ngl I think about Ankha now when I see blue and gold
Honestly I think it look good for the products and the quality of the products but I'm also super cheap so I think it look good all in all.
His old intro was a lot better lol
he looks like the boy version of charlie damilio for some reason
So sad he didn’t try the liquid blushes☹️☹️☹️ those are my fav
SHEIN IS BAD STOP HURTING THE ENVIORMENT AND CHILD LABOR THIS IS TRALLY DISAPOINTING
Erm why not the she glam blush when that's such a popular shein product?
10:40 you ain’t old they are just uncultured 🙄💅
8:54
It looks good coming from SHEIN. Especially in the sun, look how the sun kiss looks on your face. 🥰
pls do mac* lisa collab makeup for blinks
The top part of the insta powder is not the under eye and the loose powder is for the face
the FDA is anyway less strict about makeup regulamentation than Italian legislation (this makes me laugh everytime because our makeup is more light than american children's makeup lmao)
He's really good
you dont like anything jeez 🙄 it looks good to me
I’m cheap so, makeup that cost $20 is already expensive. But there’s nothing wrong with high quality makeup.
If this looks bad my makeup must look horrendous to him 😂
Team James cullen lol
Baby is really bringing back that 80s glam
i think it look rlly nice for sein ,buttt it look ok inside but outside it looks much better .love u james
Honestly I can’t tell a difference from his normal make up from this one
❤️
We love you 💜
I like the makeup but the blush and the hiliter is to shavy
🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Hey sister, can u do a full face if target please❤️
Nop, he is not open minded
Lol The editor inserting white James Charles lol😹😹😹
I have never seen this type of cool makeup don't judge it it is really good
I hope shein was not banned in India. I could buy such beautiful products in such cheap price🥺🥺. Honestly we don't get fenty n all luxury brands here. So it would be a good alternative with it being affordable for all. We really rarely get such fancy shades in the market 😭.
I really don’t like shein cuz ya know animal testing but u looked amazing
Doesn't shein work with sweatshops?
B E A U T I F U L   YOU ARE SOOOO BEAUTIFUL 😍😍😍😍😍 love the way you talk and also the way you shred your reviews 😍🥰🥰🥰🥰Loved watching you .. for the first time i saw someone sooo energetic 😊😊😊 soooo happpyyyy
I like the lip color it looks great on you
It looks okay but I tried it and it is horrible so I am on your side
Nah bc your team did you so DIRTY picking those products 😭
James: says that the result looks bad Me: can barely put eyeshadow on       Sister James you literally look stunning!!
look i think its a good makeup look u just need a different fit. like a blue shirt and yellow dunks with black jeans or smth. I think it looks really good and you couldve taken insta photos outside with the look and the pants cuz u were really glowy.
sheik died for me after watching this video
You’re so pick lmao, for SHEIN this was great
Creep
I think your eyes and lips look gorgeous 🤩
your skin turned red
does anyone know where his lashes are from
it good
i think it could of been better but the eye shadow was REALLY pretty
Love your vids!
Tbh for the people who are saying it looks good it cause of the editing and all the lighting which makes his skin glow and only James and his team can see how bad it is
yeah it looks like chizz
Thanks for doing this
I couldn't stop laughing
I would literally never order makeup from shein hahahah
James Charles definitely know this ICONIC salad scene 6:27 😂😂
I love the make uppp
Omg! The makeup queen is back!! ❤️ I love your videos you make me smile!!! 😊
Is very good James
Hi guys
ما في من القران الكريم
15:30 OMG SHE LOOKS GORGEOUS. I love it
SHEIN. SH-EIN. Not shien plz😑
You could do a full face of makeup with the most expensive items
Ok I like Shein but why online are none of the models boys?
Let’s remember he has top of the line makeup brushes so don’t be fooled into purchasing
You are my favorite you tuber!!!!
HI SITSERS :)
I love it
Impresionante como no entendí nada. Dm rápido ko ya hablas 😭😭
💜💜💜
some were good especialy the eyeshadow and the bullet lipstick but not all things are bad at shein
The final product is jot bad bit the products r bad
I saw dune and loved it
It looks great
thought i'm on 2X speed
Please do testing Pacifica Makeup :)
What the hell r u wearin bro

Ngl I forgot you still make videos
A while ago I searched SHEGLAM and its actually a brand....
"The sun rays"  LMAO

Hater
He literally talks toooooo fassttttttttttt💀💀💀💀💀
lol
"Well, I'm not reproducing. Thank God!" LOL
Why are you about if u are girl
I love the makeup look
i feel like james is the annoying friend of his group
Are you a girl?
it actually looks good, James. LOL
The lipstick 💄 was good though...no?
how-
🤢🤮
that look looks terible
I think it’s pretty good for shein.
When are you getting a girlfriend
bro parli troppo velocemente, non capisco
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Salut je suis française j’adore tes vidéo
sis I wanna see yar make up collection pls!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The look is actually bomb ngl
I think it looks great
Doja😂😂😂😂😂
I don’t want to bring this up but I hope that you can bring back the James Charles X Morphe pallets. I don’t put make up on but I heard a lot of great things’
Honestly I think you can make any makeup look work just bc you know what your doing.  It's the talent that makes it good not the products
Your makeup looks better than other looks you have done for sure and hi sister
You should do a video using all seint makeup i really perso aly like it but I would like to know what you think no abt it
it is amazing
Imma just stick to going to primark
I loved SHEIN, I was surprised at the quality of the makeup products. I have loved everything so far!
u should have used the liquid blush!! its really good!
funny enough, what James is wearing looks like shein product
Do Amazon next!
I really like it really exept for the eye shadow and the blush that was not it but overall I love it
is he a girl or a boy so sorry to ask this-
Why i keep seeing hilary duff in his face
مو مصدق عدد التقيم مايدري شكثر نشتري منه😂
You should do Walmart full face
You should do a full outfit from shein
You should do a full outfit from shein
You should do a full outfit from shein
You should do a full outfit from shein
You should do a full outfit from shein
The makeup is really good I don’t know why he’s tripping
Not bad but you can do better next time
hi james, i’ve been binge watching your videos and realized you haven’t done a video on your everyday makeup and what you use the most.. can you PLEASE do a video on that because i’ve been struggling to find good products
We need a VIDEO with ur brother againnn
I would have loved to see how they wear throughout the day
This makeup look actually turned out great!
I noticed that your eyes turned red😟😢...Are you okay???....be safe please....you are so much precious❤❤...just remember that🙂
I like your makeup suggestions
Hi I know but can you do a Makeup from penny’s
Are u s boy
I feel like I can't breathe You are beautiful in the makeup and without it💗💗
Imagine if shein watching this right now he/she/they/him or her is like:👁💧👄💧👁
Pretty
no and no. you have successfully horrified me.
the makup was fine but i think the eyeshadow ruined it but ti did not look horrible
James you look so pretty no matter what makeup you wear!!!❤️
it didn’t even look that bad nfl
James sheins just a cheap alternative and I feel like clothes shouldnt be as expensive as they are so SHEIN is good for people just trying to have cute clothes for cheap
Salad
Hey girlfriend I love you so much and your make up tutorials but you need to stop talking so much and just get to the program
Can you be like a boy not a girl
honestly i think it turned out pretty great, just me?
I whould give this a 7/10 i dont rl like the eyeshadow and lashes but i loved the vid anyways :)
I love the eye look
wow
I don't know why you are saying it looks so terrible I think it turned out looking really nice I agree on picky I like my clothes to match my eyeshadow so why didn't you match your eyeshadow to your clothes then
James, you are beautiful with or without makeup, but be aware that not all makeup you use every day because it is not good for the face
He should have done mascara and lashes and las glue too
Vk
The concealer being called salad had me dying
"I'm not reproducing so thank God" PULEASEEEE💀💀
2:29- UM👀😶….
I think it looks absolutely beautiful😊
It’s beautiful
I love the look but the eye they r nice but with the make up I think it would look realy nice if u had sunset eye shadow and the eyes and t shirt didn’t realy match
I LOVE U
Can I have a shout out???PLEASE
Why do u talk so fast
I want to see him try multiple outfits with only SHEIN clothes
Shien definitely got review robots 😂😂😂
james: wow, i saved a dollar 🤩 also james: time to use that one dollar for the dollar tree makeup ✨✨
Do you live in California?
Love love love your outfit like surely where do you get your earings!? And surely your eye shodo is butifule!! I wish just wish I was as good at make up as you!
Hey sister 🤪
i but EVERYTHING from shein
Shes giving me "chalky" lol
24m subscribers or 24m Sisters😏
YOU LOOK OK
I love shein
It is shein
That is the worst look ever babe, but magically you look good😂♥️
You can take little girl and use her makeup supplies and the girl will use yours
I like your nails
My whole class bullies you and in my head I am like that is not right and I love u so much I copy sum of your makeup tutorials✌️
THEY HAVE MAKEUP FROM SHEIN WHAAT
I want him to do my makeup someday😭😭😭💞
James you Got some talent Like make up it’s Like your painting art you perfect no matter what ❤️❤️🙂
-does see any redness or drying because every makeup YouTuber use a bullshit "blur" filter
can you do a full face make up with bratz makeup revolution? 😭😭
James, we need a collaboration with addison RAE
The Make up was okay you don't have to be so harsh
WOW!! really pretty james! don’t be so hard on yourself it looks perfect! you can pull off anything even SHEIN!!🤣
Omg I actually thought that highlighter was gorgeous!!
Omg I actually thought that highlighter was gorgeous!!
I was shocked with the primer actually his face visibly looked smoother after
Do one from five and below 💕
get a new editor pls
James I feel as tho the products with too many reviews all 5 stars you had to just give a bad review on the app just cause…. Just to see what happens
Hey sis, can you plz do half SHEIN makeup and half of face James makeup plz plz plz
its super pretty!!
Well better believe it 🤣🤣 I love Shein makeup
It looked fine but the creases ummm yeh
I am sorry
I am sorry I just don’t like that blue I just don’t think blue looks nice on anyone
sad how he didn't use the viral shein cream blush
I don't understand why he needed to edit the thumbnail to make the makeup look bad...
Your makeup looks so chic in daylight. Loveeedddddd it 👑 ❤️❤️
Wtfff I’m so glad you reviewed the primer as it’s sitting in my cart and I was gonna buy
Can you please try helaz beauty make up. Wanna know about it
Wondeful
You are beautiful so everything looks great on you …  Always love your videos  Actually I don’t do makeup so I don’t have any makeup sense but you do so good in your videos that I can’t help my self watching it . So keep it up lovely .  Love you always, One of your biggest fan  Ridney Rasel
Y’all are forgetting this looks way better with lighting and filming in real life he sees that it is very bad
Wow 🤯 You are so handsome man 💞🌹🤤 Your beauty is so mesmerizing 😈👑🔥💯💖
I can only watch  ur vids slowed down
James? Were you high or you were recording at night? Your eyes baby boy.. they are very red 🥺
As a makeup artist I can’t believe your prices on your eyeshadow pallet yk you could sell it for like 100 dollars like a normal pallet that size is the exact same is that price and crappy yours is amazing and it’s from a famous makeup artist so it’s crazy to me
it looks good
it’s not bad!! one r again better than what i can do!
I think it looks great, but your outfit is just... nah
“My crease is cut with my salad concealer “ had me on my ass 😂😂😂💖 I love you James. Such a mood
Honestly I use some makeup for shein and I think it works great :) definitely good money wise and I love it
Oof I got shein clothes (like 30 clothes)
Please try Indian brand - Lakme
Even though the makeup is from shein you made it look great
honestly, the eyeshadow didn't have the pigment and the opaqueness you would expect from the top view of the palette, but the overall look was really pretty, and I luv your vids!
Girlll it’s fine your perfect sister<3
“MY CREASE IS CUT WITH MY SALAD CONCEALER 😭😩”
I’ll watch the tiktoks u send 😩😩 pass it up
Well kinda thank you
James has not done an orange look in a while so thank you
This is how you know he’s just boujie and can’t look past the price and he only seems things expensive as being good rather than actually being able to judge the quality rather than the price. I’d love to see him use the exact same products but them not tel him the brand and then cover the labels and see his reaction
The eyeshadows were also impressive
I love the chunky gold eyeshadow, actually gorge!
He’s overreacting sooo much the products were literally fine
The way it looked exactly like how all his other makeup looks looked after he finished the base and he was like it’s not giving 😫🤣
his intro said james chares and not james charLes
The powder puff is actually such a cute idea.
his eyes are so red🤣🤣🍃
I have a question about the controversy with Shein: about a year ago a tiktok got some heat about using Shein bc it is apparently ran on CHILD LABOR. Is that true??
I think the makeup looks great I think the clashing of the top is throwing u of if u were wearing a top that matched it wouldn’t have made u think of the makeup as badly!
Did you hire a new editor?😀😄
Who wants to see a dollar tree full face makeup?
THE GLOSS IS WHAT I LIKE MOST
Isn’t SHEIN controversial because of the child labour not the knock offs
Do amazon
I need advice I really like wearing makeup and I feel confident with it one but my parents won’t let me were it. All I put on is mascara and some concealer under my eyes. How do I convince them to let me were makeup?
honestly i think u made it look really good! the lipstick looks really good on you….now i kinda wanna try shein makeup lol
It doesn’t look like his normal look but it doesn’t look bad either. The blending with the setting powder is a bit light but he looks stunning as always 🥰👌✨
Please try full face Indian brand and a Indian look
You look like a boy but you look like a girl
Please try a makeup from flormar !
Omg I always buy clothes from shein but I'd NEVER buy makeup from it
HEY SISTERS
Actually the makeup’s really good it’s just that it didn’t match your clothesssss
Edward Cullen who
ai like et
He makes everything look good ngl 😭
Their products are not safe .. clothing and makeup... chemicals ...
I think it's also important to mention how bad fast fashion is for the environment and human rights. It's not just stealing designs, it's their workers earning $1,100 for 312 hours of work each month. For comparison sake, the average American makes $5,783 and works 160 hours a month.
the makeup is fine it’s just you😶
I agree with everything youve said from 15:49 and onwards however YOU made it look good O.o
ya dont talk
after the glitter puff your skin just ended up looking realy oily
Pleas Arab sub to your vedio
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Yeah let‘s drag the most criticized brand atm to distract from me being the most criticized YouTuber. Hating on things that other people are also hating on doesn’t make you any better James
المشكله ان فعلا كله حلو البرودكتس كلها حلوه وكلنا مجربنها بس معرفش كل حاجه وحشه بنسابله ليه
It’s giving 13 going on 30, I’m here for it
I love that shirt, kinda makes me want to see what is currently in your closet.
The eyeshadow is so pretty!!! But the face is TRASH!! Not your face, you’re gorgeous queen 😁
That’s look really pretty I mean the makeup is cheap and willl the results are good
Merry Sismas!
no 6/10
random guy: "James how many siblings do you have?" James: "one brother and 24,5 M  million sisters"
I think the lipstick is pretty
Oh my gosh 😅
I hate it, everything is too shiny.
i luv the singing in this vid < 3333
yay was sssooooo helpful ,nah i'm serious
that warning is everywhere lol. they are even on glass doors
Haha
Idea for video: a Victorian or Georgian style
"My crease is cut with my salad concealer" 😂😂😂
Full face of make up from a catalogue like Avon or Mary kay... Or Any similar brand
I like it. I don't think you can have a bad look with a face like yours! :-) <3
10:27 i have that blush
It's looks fine
Shein makeup is kinda a thief, like a bootleg of a good mark. I tried it, it came even worse than you could expect
Can you post links to products you used
i think its looks great but it may look better on camera but to me its looks AMAZING
honestly your makeup is soo much better the SHEIN but he did this lovely make up from SHEIN
Ok I’m definitely not a fan of James. However, I want to know what shien makeup is like- LIKE OK FINALLY CHEERS FOR TELLING US. But I still don’t like you (and yes I’m in giving him views but that’s ok because we’re all mature <3 xoxo
it actually looks pretty cute even though the products are from shein
James throughout the vid: "    "
"right in front of my salad" IYKYK 🥴
its gorgeous but you guys choose THE WRONG brand theres somthing that is more good than that from shein
Hi hi ladies
It’s fine
Can you do a full face of Kylie cosmetics makeup?
Pro tip with shein reviews ones with pictures are the best!!!
Honestly the eyes look good and also the lips but the blush is not it.
I love Shein makeup it’s the only kind I’m not allergic too lololol
Love u james
Ssssoooooo nice
Love from india ❤️❤️
No it’s actually not just for California we’re getting the same ingredients as everyone else does thank god they warn the Californians
It looks good
it look find
try Indian bridal make up or just Indian makeup
Wait I love this😘
love you Jamse
I’m 30 and I used to say that in school 😂😂😂
Prop 65!! Lmao
I think it looks really good but I think the products are a bit dull but overall my favourite part is the lip stick a lipgloss I think it has a really nice shimmer and overall I will give it about 6 out of 10
No sis ples No
my sensitive skin could NEVER
it’s giving 50s or euphoria
I like shein.But your look is awsome like angel💖
OMG, that blush🤐
do H&M makeup next
My 6 year old just said, Oh My God that’s…
can you do full makeup of W7
My crease is cut with my salad concealer 😂
The hand gestures and catch phrases though 💖💖💖💖
I dont like James but damn is his make up tutorials helpful
Eyeliner ❤️
Heyyy James missed you!! love you!
Do dollars tree
now do dollar tree!!
Try the wigs from Shein !!
HI SISTERS😩😩
I thought the eyeshadow look was great, but the consistency of some of the products...........
James should do a full face of drugstore makeup
Some people aren’t just trying it out lol it’s there day by day make up !
Ok but they do have good cheap lashes
i dont like makeup but i am happy you belief in your self
James hands - 🖐️🙌
your beautiful face is ok no matter what james
hi James, i just wanna say that Jesus loves you so much, He is with you!
THE NEW INTRO I LOVEEEEEEE
Erm love the lips but that’s about it 🤷🏼‍♀️
The FDA is not only outdated, but it is wayyyy to relaxed. They only ban like 11 ingredients, but the EU bans 1,328.
Girl
I think that it looks okay but the colors need some work not gonna lie
They give you coupon points to review. That is why some products have so many reviews.
That looks so danm good gud job xxxx
You are the best. What is your favorite color
I love your videos
i don’t like it sorry james
i really do not like it and i’m on 8:07 and it’s not going good no affence  james
You've definitely done better James. But I think it was definitely the top that made it more... Meh!
You make any product look good
not him trying to be the mean girl 😗
Why the concealers got weird names like the one called salad it made me think of the color green so I was like wait what like girl I thought he was finna pull out a green concealer
Hey James so my sister loves SHEIN (not make up) but she always say that there lashes are great I hope you could do a part 2 and try them thank you!
9:52
James the makeup literally looked perfect what are you talking about 😂
Try to 1$ make-up kit🤣
Omgggggg it looks soooooo goooddddddd sis
Maybe it’s supposed to be an egg salad? 😂
How can he take anything and turn it it to a beautiful look love you James ❤️
*watches as I spent $55 on the new sheglam horoscope kit”
that was the worst definition of fast fashion i’ve ever heard. what about the child labor and environmental impact?
The editing for this video has been dying!!!! Betteeen the moose and the flashback pic   I was holleringgg
Hi 😮😮😺😸
OMG I FREAKING LOVE YOU!!!!😩💙
what lashes is he wearing ?
9:44 hahahah it reminded me of the movie too
Wait so we forgot…..?
He can make any makeup look good, so I can’t tell how good the products are.
I honestly thought it was fine better than I could ever do lmao
I get anxiety stressed af from him.... my bruxxism kicking in
but it looked too cheapy
Love it!!!!!!!
i thought it was good for the pricing of the makeup. Could you do some more videos of makeup products for people on a budget? I think this would help so many people out!
SHEIN is also controversial because it’s not ethical at all. If you look on any websites that show you how ethical a shop is (very helpful btw we don’t wanna burn from climate change) they will not recommend it at all. SHEIN is cruel to animals, the environment and their workers get paid in cents. Come on, people.
Looking like Edward Cullen in the sun 🤣✨
Salad
Sslad😂
HEY SISTERS AAAAHHAHH
I dont like it, I agree with you james
shein
why tf is he doing quotes with everything he says
Why didn’t you use shein eyelashes!! They have sooo many
the subtitles HELPP
That actually looked so good
Love it with the eye lashes too
I think the look looks pretty good. Really it very very beautiful and the product are also very good
I mean it’s okay could be better bus it’s not as good as the X Morphy pallet
Everyone is saying he is being too negative while all I hear is honesty here
Well done James I cant do makeup and if I want to learn I can't do it because I have two spots under my eyelids. I wish you a great day if you are reading this ( to everyone)
Shein is actually cool and awesome but you are not  Mind i think i do harsh but i subcribes
james we do the reviews for points srry
Ok James I am just saying Mecca in Melbourne is not selling the James Charles palatte
Video recommendation- I know you done react videos on your old YouTube Channel but I think you should do another one to the webcam on December 4 on December 4 because it’s coming up :p
the makeup litterally looks so good huh
love the top sister
JK. I am so sorry for you and your salvation.... it isn't too late for you to go to God😞
hey James, love you and your videos!
so as a person who shops on shein they have really great products! For such cheep prices I personally think these are good products. I believe they mean well and most of the time there clothes GIVE!!!! But I do see where your coming from, I dont think I would use the foundation... BUT you should definitely do a video buying clothes from Shein!!!🤎
the makeup gave me kinda 2015 vibes of  u with the powder and the blush i didnt like but the rest was stunning sister xx
Hi
Love you intro ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
When you first put on the foundation you looked like the peanut butter baby
Integrity? 💀
no dop
I like the lipstick
I love you and it’s so pretty and there’s knock off things but yeah
you mach your make up
can you do the moon
Il Dio ghane
So Pretty!!!!!!!!!! You're Gorgeous
Shein is bad for the environment stop buying from there
It looks find but the eye shadow was not matching
why u still posting
Shein is unethical af
oop
It looks good
Please do a full face colourpop
I appreciate sheins warning, but something makeup artists don’t realize is almost EVERY makeup brand except for clean beauty has dangerous chemicals. I’m a makeup artist who still uses them too, but SHEIN isn’t worse in the makeup department
James you should try she glams liquid blush or is cream idk but it's really good 😀😀
But it looks good though...
The make up is fine for being Shein but why are your eyes so red
I dont like james but this video was hilarious
Your makeup in the sunlight though??? My $1000+ makeup routine doesn’t even have my skin looking that snatched
Oh my goodness**
Oh goodness**
i think james needs to look up how reviews work. not everyone has to rate it 5 stars for it to say 5 stars 😭😭
JAMES wth did ya do to ya face. BLUE!!! BLUE EYESHADOW!!!!! NO!!!! Your blush was too pink and your contour was too dark for you to pop in a BLUE!!!! You should have done red, orange, and gold. You had all of the colors and it would have been beautiful. Sorry I might have gotten a little out of hand. Or should I say a little out of COLOR PALATE? Okay, I'm sorry about my rant I'm done now.
you make everything look good ❤️❤️lol
Do dollar tree makeup next
Why don’t u sell ur pallets anymore I was going to get my daughter one
Loved this! PLEASE do a part two with different Shein products as well as a follow up saying whether or not this irritated your skin, thanks for the awesome content!
ok she looks BUSTED and I know its from shein but ooooof
It really looks good
it looks very beachy and i love that <3
most products have 5 stars because it gives you extra points and also if you dont slect 5 stars it asks you why and then you have to answer loads of quetions
I feel like, for the price you're paying, you were able to get a pretty decent makeup look. The eyeshadow honestly wasn't bad.
I would watch your tiktoks if I had it, sister c: ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
He really said “with my salad concealer”😂 I’m rolling😂
Actually looks beautiful unless you do pink and purple but it’s still pretty but can you pink and purple in the next video
James is so against shein, I love him 😭😭
Hi James
I was actaully buying clothes from SHEIN so ya
CHILE ANYGAYS SO
You have been my fave for more than a year or 2
Is you likeing the buying on robux????????????
the shimmer puff looks so cuteeeeeeee
please review  beauty bay x jade palette
It looks fine but too shine and wightish cind of
A Devil Live
Still look the same not good
why the SALAD concealer tho
its ok
YOU SHOULD TRY MARY K MAKE-UP  PLUs THEY ALSO HAVE SKINCARE PRODUCTS AS WELL
does it weird anyone out that he’s using meme’s with POC when he’s making a joke. like pretty much every single one… like he’s trying too hard or he’s making fun of POC… don’t like that at all either way
it looooks amazinggg, love the blue & gold ughhh <3
Its cute but not the best
it's u g l y
Is there any way that you can please do dollar tree makeup
i looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooove your videossssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
NEXT U HAVE TO DO ELF
Looks great on film. I’d have to see it in a natural light.
I loved this some much
I love the look!!!!
it's awful lmao
en camara y con luces de estudio esta bien, pero para salir o con el sol es horrible
James I’m a huge fan
SALAD CONCEALER
I’d love to see an essence product review
tbh its not ur best ook, BUT either way it still looks rlly good in the sun and that's all we need :)
The top is not that good but the bottom is so good
I think it was good for the price. Ofc there are much better products but for much more money. Personally I would probably get the foundation and the eye shadow but the rest is not for me. But I mean you kinda get what pay for in all honesty! But you rock any makeup you make it look good love your vids James <3
i almost had an asthma attack at 13:07
I feel annoyed that I told my friends about SHEIN before it was popular and they would make fun of me and laugh at me cuz I thought it was cool. Now I see them wear EVERYTHING from SHEIN, and it’s SOOOO ANNOYING!!!!!
This looks good but your a beauty gurue so it’s gonna look bad for ur
Very good job..
Shein is for the people who cannot buy or afford  expensive things it's just because you're rich. Plss understand them too
Why are you judging shein
Heyaa James, newbie here but i can say the eye make up is really bad.
The makeup, is not bad I feel like the simmer puff is not worth it I dose not make sence
The mem tho 🤣😂
Honestly it looked great on you James, you can honestly make anything look good! Personally the blush was too pink for my liking and it kinda clashed a bit with the blue and gold eyeshadow but I think the look turned out great 👍 💛❤️
I just logged on to this channel and really really like it! 😍😍😍
No offense but I kinda really hate it. But don’t take it like in the wrong way I love you and all ur makeup ideas, except this one lol ❤️❤️❤️
You look beautiful
Jeffrey star is quaking
I really don’t know why he’s complaining so much from cheap 5 dollar products. you get what you pay for. and it’s shein, of course it’s going to be cheap.
Hey James! I’m wondering if you could do an honest review of the “SHEGLAM Jelly Wow Hydrating Lip Oil” I really would like to know whether I should buy it or not :)
It was pretty James ❤️🥰
....
I love James' haircut
The make was fine
I love all the videos u do
U look more beautiful , without makeup.....😅
once again james… it’s fine
It's cute
It actually looks great just change the lips and shirt
I started with SHEIN makeup , the concealer wasn’t that bad but then again I was a beginner I have 2 or 3 makeup pallets from SHEIN, they aren’t to good but I only used a few colors , and they actually still gave me a decent look how ever like you said supper powdery and hard to blend, I now have a james Charles pallet a simpsons pallet and ngl a few 5 below pallets that I use the highlights on , there actually pretty decent
I tried some of the sheglam makeup brand and it was juuuunk. Melted off my face in 20 minutes 😅
You still look good but it’s not a LOOK if that makes sense love these videos tho!
Noo jamesss the blush…. U could have got the liquid one it’s pretty good
That look is beautiful
Amazon
It came out nice I'm honestly not a makeup person but I do love there clothes
James, you're amazing! You really made these products work... Although your eyes did seem a bit red after you put on the eye shadows, hope they're fine! But aside from all that I really loved the whole look especially in the sun... Loads of love! 💓💓🤍🤍
Except the EYES everything else looks fine James
يشبه واحد بالضبط موجود بمدرستنا 😭
هذا كيف عنده 24 مليون
My brother says I’m a weirdo because I like your videos💀
The only thing I like personally is the glow gloss
OMG why are you so CUTE  Now i wanna try SHIEN makeup products
He forgot to buy the lashes from them
what kinda shirt is that like wth
you look beautiful sister!
James im a big fan can you do a makeup tutorial for beginners pls!!!!
I love the eye lashes curler
No Bestie You Are Serving!         At McDonalds..... (IM SORRY)
Too make Thai funny you should do Walmart makeup that would be so funny and cool
uhh the blush is like way to strong and it looks really cakey ngl
he went from complementing shein to tapping them off
that was very good
I think it looks good
‼️⚠️SPREAD THIS⚠️‼️ JAMES CAN YOU DRESS UP AS HISOKA AND DO HIS MAKEUP??
Not perfect but it's okay
So can you breathe when you talk???
not good :p
Do make up from Amazon
You are man or womer WTF
The only problem wit.h me is it didn’t match the shirt
Can you do like zodiac based makeup
la combination no me gusta prefiero el normal
Ok babes I'm a really honest person so Ima give you my review  The eyeshadow colors don't really match The foundation,concealer, and primer are just pealing off The highlighter is fine just not the best The bronzer is fine And the gloss just isn't doing good AT ALL.  Love ya tho.
Why are you so irresponsible, James? Shien is known for basically human slavery, and given the low price of their stuff you can just imagine what they put in their makeup and the animals that have suffered for it. DO NOT advertise Shien shit as "fun and trash" when you should outright seek to outlaw them to your viewers.
5:36 Me: OHH MY GOD
When it comes to anything that touches your body you need to know where it's coming from and how is it made.
The year 2021.... Omg.
Not trying to be rude, but NOT EVERYONE CAN AFFORD MORPHE LOOKIN MAKEUP!!!!!!!!!! I've tried all of these and came out with good results. (social links will not be provided for privacy reasons ty.)
It i Beautiful you ❤️
The product quality was a 7/10 but the overall makeup 💄 look was a 9/10
😂😅
Or it says dalas 😂
It was better than wish
Completely spoiled out of his mind by his parents. Omg his mother has babied this man to the point of delusion. Who calls a grown man baby?  Is he charismatic and articulate? Yes. He’s also spoiled and self absorbed to a degree that’s scary.
I love you so much I love my work and you are very kind, I really admire you I hope one day I can see you😍🤗💜
is it just me or are there more memes..and more black ppl. i love it ofc
Love u James but u said good color on the foundation and u looked like casper
do  romwe now please!!
I think that makeup look is really pretty and I love the eyeshadow combination and to keep the draging going to James, James it looks fiiiinneee
His editing is so boring
do a drunk makeup challenge
You make everything look good! It honestly looked pretty good and i personally think it looked better inside then when you did the outside clip💕
Your red face on your cheeks kinda looks like blush no offense sister mwah <3
I think it overall looks really good but I’m not the biggest fan with how powdery the eyeshadow pallet. But overall it looks stunning <3
The products were horrible ❤️
Pls do a dollar tree makeup full face 🥺
You didn't use any of their best seller 😭
If y’all want a better review from someone who isn’t super biased, watch Robert Welsh and his review on SHEIN. He gives a good review. I don’t hate James but I understand he’s used to super expensive top tier products. So of course he’s not going to like it.
I did I full face shein makeup and it looked amazing☺️
How are YOU gonna talk about integrity?
What is your zodiac sign😊 I'm a sagittarius  ♐😊
I am in love with the result and yes of course James has his opinion to it and we all have our opinion to it so yh......but i love the eyeshadow
He looks good just maybe change ur shirt to white or black bc any color can go with it. just my heads up for next time!😁
It’s a pretty cute look but only with you I think not with me for sure!
Oh so I can’t use my pallet on my face??
I like but the highlighter is not good enough because it’s chunky
I wish you would’ve tried the cream blush!
I Acutally really like the eye shadow palette and Lip gloss
awesome video
The blush sucks for sure
James, are you ever getting any more piercings?
You should do a video on ur friends reacting to the videos you send them
His introduction is the shin in my day
The face looks a little greasy but the colors are great.
I laghed when he said that the contor was named "saled" LOL
I actually like the eye look alot, changing ur shirt would alter ur entire view of it. Honestly the entire look wasn't that bad, and when u went outside that sparkle was everything. Like seriously high key giving me Twilight 🤷🏼.
Ok the makeup wasn't great but you are so good if I did it it would look like I came out of a trash can lol
My skin is oily and dry some parts so my skin would probably be patchy with foundation rub off with glasses lol
i put 5 stars for points XD
I read a bit of the packaging for the white powder and it said don’t put under ur eyes I’m screaming.
Pink saled🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
Saled😂🤔🤨
James you look good no matter what 😁🌻🍧
Why are you still on you tube didn't you request photos that you shouldn't have
HI! It's my first watching ur video and I wanna say that u r an inspiration! I love the way u respect and love what u r and what u like  U look great without makeup and about ur makeup u look amazing with ur makeup

For being that the hole look was from shein, James definitely slayed!!
He looks like a girl  is he gya
Lmao, no. That’s all ima say, plus he’s way to pretty to make ANY kind of makeup look to bad :))
You actually made that toxicity look good 😂
Love you
He’s giving very much 🐠🐟

Everything is perfect but the lipstick is weird

I’m Ellie I love your  videos so much your the resin I started make up 😍
It was all good beside the blush
“Let me do the cream I’ve been into that lately “ 😅
The reason they are all high rated is because you get SHEIN points for rating and the higher the rate the more SHEIN points
I think that you look beautiful!
its so bad- especially the eyeshadow
U should try outfits with matching makeup from Shein like u should buy some outfits from Shein then u match it with makeup full face makeup hope u sweet my commwnt
I love it its so beautiful 😘🥰
I can just hear James’s skin screaming
I don’t like the look but you did better than I could have with those products!
JAMES YOU CANT TALK ABOUT EYESHADOW BEING POWDERY LOL YOUR Make up  palette is worse . Way too much powder . Looks like you doing cocaine. Don’t be talking shit about other brand if you aren’t perfect 🤨🤨
SHEIN CAME OUT IN OCTOBER 2008 I JUST LOOKED IT UPPP

James Charles roasting shein makes me laugh

''Its fast fashion, and this is why its bad.'' *completely ignores child slavery and the environmental impacts* ''they steal designes.''
James still being gorg with no make up on. I love you!
Nah cause James should do a outfit combo with this eyeshadow look cause it’s so cute
8 out of 10 look but fr u slay anything lol
Okayyy but the eyes are giving Cleopatra vibes 💙✨
Shein is just the English version of Wish 😂
You should do Florence makeup
heyy baby girl
YOU ARE SO SO COOL
Hii
You should do an elf makeup Tutorial!!!♥️♥️
it looks nice
HI BRI
I LOVE THIS VIDEO!!!!!!!!!
I would probably be a happier person if I was James
I bay makeup from SHEIN for while and honestly all the products that I used was so good and even the brushes the quality was so good. But I didn’t try the products you used so unfortunately that not all the products good or bad
Okay but the clothes from Shein is actually good.
OMG I think James should do a video were he  does makeup and takes it of
it wwas not bad
I love u James
The makeup is just so so Beautiful and The more he puts on the make up the more I want to go get make up from SHEIN but I’m scared for my face because my mom said that the make up products are going to get pimples on my face so I already have that so I’m good
it's a layer 😅 I'm sorry but I'm already using alote of products from sheglam and every time I'm embraced with the quality, I know that the concealer is not good also I don't like that but thier eyeshadow is ensan in my opinion.
James I love it to be like for real I would love to have that stuff
Why do u move your hands that much  I like it I am just asking🥰🥰🥰😇😇😇
why don't you zoom in when you review big brands ... ? this isn't that bad but your reaction is so weird ...
Ok but the clothes on she in are giving but you have to search the right stuff
Shot up
hey can you give me some  make up plz 😥😥😥😥😥🤧🤧🤧☹☹☹☹☹☹😕😕😕 i don't have any plz i am beging you.
He thinks he's a singer , he's convinced 🙄 🤣

Sisters that is so beautiful I am jealous you look really pretty it is so beautiful ❤️❤️❤️🥺🥺🥺
His face was glitter and was only glitter😭
I ABSOLUTELLLLYYYY LOVE IT!!! Eeeeeek. Then again not a big makeup artist but that's why we all have u

I Love iiiiiitt😻
That really pretty James aasaaaah!!!
Im new in this channel. How about catrice full face? 🥺
Your SO PRETTY 🤩 😍
OMG I have those brushes they are AMAZING💕💕
James one of my friends said u like girls and u are g** is that really true? I’m not saying it is but my friend said that u like girls and ur g**
Can you do a face of makeup by Pacifica?!? It is a really great and healthy brand! It is vegan and it is really pretty makeup set, I think you would really like it!
Could you do a fulll face of makeup from dollar store
oh. hes. back.
I love your makeup😁
hiiii I love your videos and I hope you will say hi to me🥰
omg hiiiii i’m a big fan my twin isn’t really but i love your channel
I haven’t heard the No alibi song in years I used to say it all the time
IT LOOKS SO GOOD
James makes bad make up look flawless. Love you James from Australia 🇦🇺❤️🤍💙
I love this video!
Ok but now I wanna know your review on dune
Idk if James already did this but it'd be cool to see him do a Korean style of makeup. It's the complete opposite of his usual makeup of heavy contouring and having a matte finish and I think his natural clear skin fits well with the Korean makeup.
Hey beautiful people- This is with No hate ❤️But Shein is a horrible company. They support modern-day slavery, exploit the environment and overall fuel Fast Fashion. I understand that it might seem intriguing to buy from there since they offer very trendy products at dumpster-low prices. However,  some people have to pay with their life and freedom for the products we will wear on our bodies. There are many ethical companies which offer high quality beauty products at affordable prices and are completely transparent about their ingredients. All Love 🌈 Have a wonderful Day ☕😘
She thinks shes a guru shes convinced!   She thinks everybody loves her shes convinced!
I think it looks fine on its own if I only look at your face but I agree the shirt and makeup color combo just ain't working for me.
It is beautiful
The fact that he says he’s going in with an open mind but all he can do is talk down on shein👋🏼
yall do know that the makeup is tested on animals, right? this is not it
You're so fine looking with shein makeups❤️  Love lots from Philippines ❤️
James your editor is just fabulous 🥰😂
I don’t know if u know this but u are being a inspiration to us love u James
U are a boy?
James does makeup so pretty 😍
I think the blue is like the beach like the water of the beach a day I think it's kinda of working together and I love the theme of it I like the blue I think it's like the beach and....... I miss the beach because in south India there is rain that is like the road is covered in water so I can't go to the beach are anywhere so as everyone in South India
.
"Only in California it's the sunrays" NO FUCKING SHIT IT'S 90 DEGREES F IN NOVEMBER
shein has better products than u
the look was fine and cute only the eye shadow was a problem but always looks good on james
can you come to new zealand
maybe i'm delusional but the whole final look (with the top included) is giving me y2k winx club vibes and i'm kinda in for it
omg imagine a full face of make up from aliexpress
hey sister my name is maddy i am 11 years old i have been wacting you for years now i love your vids so much i really like the editinbg it so sister snached and cute i know you proubly wont read this but just know you are so amazing
You looks so good dude I love it!😍
my friend called u a bigmac
i orderd a knock off huda beauty eyeshadow pallete from shein for like $9 and let me tell u i love it lmaooo
Its better then I could do
I actually really like it, I feel like if your shirt were to be blue and/or yellow it would look Excellent!
From Amazon but with low ratings 😁 PLEASE
Hi sister James, can you try Ariana Grande makeup please? I would loooooooove it! Also, i would love if you do her makeup.
can you do a stranger things look please 🤔
I have NOT tried any SHEIN makeup but it wasn’t THAT bad lol it just needed a little shaping🥴😂 but for me just getting into this I LOVED this video lol I want the Puff sparkle ball
how can anyone like this
i think it looked good
Well not a lot of people have that kinda money to be buying $10,000 bags. So yes SHEIN is a great alternative for the people who don’t have YOUR kind of money 🤦🏽‍♀️

REM BEAUTY REVIEW PLEASE ❤️❤️
so nice and not what i expected but not bad and i maybe order makeup from shein
honestly, it looks fine, not the best, just fine, but it would have looked better if you wore another top.
Saw him on The Toonight Show on YouTube, people need to go watch it.  Not real but so funny
you look beautiful sisterrrrrrr
It looks rlly like cakey lol
Its looks ok but not my favorite make up look ▪-▪
No.
It’s the commentary for me 🥰
Are you he or she ? 🤔🤔🤔
Am I the only one that actually thinks this looks kind of good.
I don’t really mind this look, for what it is and how much it cost, it’s pretty good.
It because it not like 30000$ that tooo much
I love the SHEIN😍😍😍
5 stars
What the heck!!!!!!!!!!
uhm why was every little vid he added was a black person.... 😀😀
It's bad but when you were it it's stunning
james talking about the 1% as if he isnt in the 1% is Not cute
Hi James I Love Your Videos And Your The Reason I Got Into Makeup
I think it looks fine and is really good for being from SHEIN
not the anna oop thumbnail
I think it looks great. I mean anything looks great on you
Please just be aware that some of SHEIN stuff have very bad toxin in them like lead poisoning. Please wash y’all items it helps take out some of the toxins but not all

Do a tutoring vid on mathematics or "sumthing" get it 🤣🤣
You actually look gorgeous in all makeup styles
It’s ok
Jamesss you look so good I love your videos!!!
Ridiculous the other 49 states are fine with the product except for California bull crap
I am digging this new intro so much right now
James flicked us off on the low 😭😭
For shein, this is great bc u gotta think about the price difference between shein and like kylie bro its not the best but i don't mind it especially on camera
I think it looks great!
You should do a video but do everything you do but Backwards
I love makeup but I have sensitive skin
so the only thing wrong with fast fashion is knocking off other brands? Really??? Nothing like worker's rights or anything....
8:11
i’m praying for your skin James🥲💜💜
13 going on 30 vibes
James should try makeup from Amazon!
Are you a girl or a boy?
Ohh rolling ray
in the video the makeup didn’t look bad but idk abt in person 😂
I cannot stop laughing at the thumbnail
Cab do cab
ITS REALLY NOT THAT BAD STOP JAMES
It looks lovely James.. ❤❤
heyy james could you do a full face of makeup from amazon colorgram?
It's ok
Love you James
I love your makeup you’re my favorite YouTuber!
I love you so much
I HAVE A QUESTION WHY Why are you so mean to Kenzie
Shhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!
8:29 it’s giving flashback Mary era 😻😻
At first i agreed with everything james said....then i saw the blush...guuurrl way you so perfect you make every thing work tho
The makeup isn’t that bad tho
💙🤗💙ENJOYED IT💙 DON'T KNOW I'd BUY IT💙🤗💙11.14.21💙🤗💙
“My crease is cut with my salad concealer” i died 😂😂😂😂
PLEASE STOP SUPPORTING THIS BRAND! When you make purchases from this brand and post it on your channel for views you are encouraging others to make purchases too. And although some people cannot afford to shop more ethically YOU CAN. I know that you and your team must care about this planet, or at least say that you do, but you have to do your part. You can afford to do better things for the environment so please do.
You should take another video like this one because I want to see the cheapest make up ever so I think you should do another video like this that’s just my opinion
Do Sephora
I love the makeup
It’s butter full
Shein represents Child labor abuse at its most glorious. Watch Justine Leconte for more informed shopping. How do you think they can sell at such low prices 😡
I THOUGHT YOU DIED
LMAOOOOOOOOO  6:17
I feel like you could put mud on your face and it will still look good 😂
; the fact im wearing a shein hoodie rn..
It's schin
I PROMISE TO WATCH ALL UR TIKTOKS JAMES
8:53
i love him and i love his videos and every thing but... he was being VERY strict with the products and that SUCKS
Dislike
I bought a small pallet and it is so fucking pretty and works so well
ratio ?
James!! Do a full face of makeup from the little girls “toy” department 😂😂
I would love you to recreate your crews make up
Is it just me, or does his eyes look red asf? 👀👀
No hate but its not bad, but its not tradable but it's not good. I love u james but this is just not sitting right with me😬
Bestie…
who the fuck asked
I think that everything was great except for the highliter
8:54 Here you go sisters ❤️
no matter what products u always do ur makeup way better than me
Your so creative, smart, kind, and beautiful... You are awesome and don't let anyone tell you the opposite (or at least don't believe it). You deserve the best... ❤💕(❁´◡`❁)
Thankyou so much besto friendo
Idk what it is with your videos but it always help my mind calm down in a way or declutter also brings me peace when something is troubling me so thankyou so much for it 👌🏻♥️
I love shein its were I get my clothes lol btw they do figets
The speech he made about him needing better friends was so dramatic and relatable lmao😂😂
Jame be like: 😯 not gonna lie it gives skin tone vibes
Love the intro
The eyeshadow reminds me of a butterfly
Other then the highlighter I love it!
NEVER BUY ANYTHING FORM THAT BRAND OBVIOUSLY THEIR STUFF IS TERRIBLE LIKE A LOT 🤢
the makeup is good
The makeup look, looks fine to me. Idk anything from SHEIN but it gave a good quality on this look. And I do hope you can make a video of using Ariana Grande new makeup line she released. Idk. I guess it’s just me who wants to see this video.
I love the nails
I like the shimmer puffy thing lol. That can be used for like a summer look
It looks amazing. And I do use shein products!
she In lol ima say it that way now
ITS BEAUTIFUL
it looked fine i do think there was too much shimmer LOL
All i think is that if your really good at makeup you can make any product look fabulous 🤷🏼‍♀️ its all abt the skills
In the sun it looks looked decent. But the glitter inside just added this oily mess effect 😭💀
okay but i need to hear your opinion of dune.
its good you look pretty
I love itt😍😍..I wish I can hv some
can you please try namshi
the iconic hey sistersss ive been watching you when i was 13
Are you a girl ore a boy
Omg James here’s a video idea: a full face of makeup from Essence makeup (it’s like european elf lol)
I think now he has to do a full face of itsy make up
Hi SiStErS
Hi James
13:15 HELP IM CRYING
It’s not bad like the products seemed like they wanted to work but not rlly
I liked the makeup you did, it was a crazy and perfect combination ❤️
তোর ধন কাইট্টা দেমু।
I wouldn't get any make up from shein
My bothers name is james
Lots of them were pretty good but the lip gloss ruined the pretty lipstick 6/10
James; you should do a full face video of IL MAKIAGE Products! I use them n love them! I think it’d look Amazing on you!! Plus there products are amazingggggg
its a beautiful look James!
I love how he calls it she IN
Personally, I think it looks beautiful! I think you used a little too much blue eyeshadow but overall, it looks AMAZING!
this video is perfect, you look like a christmas ornament
Please do a full face of Fenty Beauty or Colourpop
Hi James I love your videos
I like your nails james!
James! The look is actually not that bad. If you were wearing blue or a cream colored top it would be gorgeous! I would've loved for you to try the SHEGLAM Stay Wild Jelly Glitter (in ICY, specifically) it's so so pretty! It has these pretty star and moon chunks in it that look really stunning and edgy beneath the eye or as a cheekbone highlight. If you ever do a part two to this video, please try it out!
I really like it! ✔︎ ت
Can you please do a fullface of kylie cosmetic?       like if you agree?
You are a pro at make up so u r too hard on makeup and yourself but yes some products didn’t work well but you wouldn’t know as you looked amazing
James Why Did You Bully A Teenager she was Helping You And You said You're Never Gonna Win
That’s so cuteee your my fav YouTuber stay strong be your own self
i love it and keep it on!!!
Can you do another clean out your makeup room video? It’s been like 2 years James! Or maybe another have the people in front of me pick my makeup? But these r just suggestions, love you sister!
The movie that cheer was from was Wildcats. Yes you are dating yourself, but I really am.
It would be funny if he did dollar tree or the 99 cents store or both together
omgoodness be careful with that primer, id be scarred too.
I think the look was AMAZING but it was just the color combo. what if you did ROMWE?
Thank You!!!!!!!!! this will help a lot!
I also  bought  those brushes ❤
omgg what lashes did james use ?
this looks really good but the puff ball was just not it Lol
YUH
Claires omg u should sis

No! Hate but why are you useing black people only in  this vidoe???
JAMES PLZ REVIEW NIKIES BRAND NIMYA
Sis u look as pretty as mee
R.E.M BEAUTY JUST LAUNCHED!!!!!!
can you review rem beauty?
There all five stars for points I’m such a sucker for points tbh
Why did the people watch this??
cool 😂💞🥺
The thing about James is when we do our make up most of us can’t get it even close to what James can do and that is why he thinks these make up looks look bad because he knows he can do better so that is why he doesn’t like it
it’s also fast fashion because it’s killing the environment but i know that must be difficult for you to comprehend with you little brain
Full face of Ariana Grande new R.E.M beauty makeup?????😟😟
plz review rem beauty by ariana grande
YASSSS queen
it’s actually pronounced shine
Wat nat yeu nat meching vidioz
It looks so good omg
still dont like you but you look high asf
Elf next😀
Do a full make up look with just ur palette
Honestly I love it girl but u do u girl friend
james charles you’re the worst human being  why would you bully kenzie and telling her she would never  win ?
Love yuh bish
I rate most things 5 stars bc they’re actually good and I’m like a child so I can’t afford to pay a bunch of money for fancy shiii
Ight, it would look better with some nicer products and that’s Lacey’s Opinion :)
I cracked up when he said my crease is cut with my salad concealer 😂😂😂
Hi am new here plzz can someone say me is he a boy or a girl?
THAT TOP 💗✨🥵
I’m so sad that he didn’t do any Halloween videos like he did last year but maybe he will with Christmas
It looks good though
The clothes are good
You're just fking jealous of his fking successful life, yall need to work hard if you want to live comfortably stop dragging influencers on the Internet that are trying hard to satisfy your fking eyes to watch their videos all you do is to fk around and want the attention of this guy not knowing that he feels uncomfortable, depressed, sad    And etc.
He's not saying the price of a make up HE'S POINTING THE FELLING that he gets about the foundation, the QUALITY of a product and the COMBINATION that he feels isn't right. If you guys going to spent your time hating james i recommend you to look at the mirror and judge your fking life
👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
do people still support him after the shit he's done? Wtf
I agree with what you said.
It doesn’t looks terrible with that price it’s fine
stop encourge this brands
You are a boy??🙂
The 'hi sisters' just makes my day better :))) '
Common James you look gorgeous, I know you are a big makeup artist and needs       ✨ PERFECT✨ look, but all of the looks you have rated "okayish" "or fine" are GORGEOUS! OK?? You are an amazing makeup artist so shut up
HI
james i have a question ! i really need advice on this, so because you use so much makeup, ofc it must be damaging the skin in some way, so what is your skin care routine?
amazing sister
JAMES I LIKE YOUR VIDEOS , KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!!!
Wow nice dress👏
its fine just we have to dig in for getting the shade of the eyeshadow
I don't know why,but i felt soo satisfied when i watch James Charles's videos😤💕
Try out country wise best make up brands.. Start off with India please 🇮🇳😘
You look good but I could see your pores and the highlighter is too chunky and the blush is overdoing it but the lips looks good
hey can you please do a collab with olivia rodrigo  aye what do yall think idk I just think it's will be fun
Honey plz the contour u look good tho

I think it looks good that's all I have to say everyone in here has long stuff to say but I don't I don't know what to say so it looks good
Hi I was watching some old videos and I found out we have the same birthday sister !!
ive missed alot if chapters! THE NEW INTRO IS SO COOL
U should do a half ur make up and half shin (did I spell it right ps I'm 11)
You should do a makeup challenge without looking at your face like no mirror or phone screen or anything of that nature that would be very interesting to watch
Hai James I love watching your videos your inspiring and everyday I watch ur vids and I love when u say HI SISTERS it makes my day keep up the great work James!!!
It’s a no for me boo 😬
Hey sister
I loved it it’s just your outfit doesn’t match with your makeup

I. Love. It
it looks really good for it being the fact the makeup came from shein. i shop on shein alot and i can say when it come to makeup on shein its a hit or miss type of thing. they do have some products that are really good and than theres the products that are just horrible. but overall the makeup look did come out really good.
The Ellen dab surprised me, I love it
*hi James Charles I love your videos and slayyy*
Mama! Mama o mama mama mama Mamaaaa *gibberish* *screams*

I love love love Shein makeup, I almost have everything but not the creme products!!!

Okay to be honest I'm camera it looks fine but when you're outside it looks really messed up because of the makeup products used
Everything is good but underneath your eyes
it actually looks rlly good

Why are there no ads anymore?
that face was beautiful as always you shine James
Supppppp people
Amazon
You talk so fast
That says salad “Does it not”
We wanna know how it wears through the day James...
I have heard that the lip products from shein are made out of poop cow pooop
So many awful chemicals in that makeup.  You're face will fall off.
Oh
Your still better than me
Hi James Charles Dickinson
Omg please do a video of reacting to SHEIN reviews 😭😭😭 they are hilarious JAMES PLEASE. !!!
I Personally Like This Make Up But I Think James Charles Makeup Will Look Better (Duhhh)
I is not good makeup set but you have done a good job
I shop in SHEIN
it is pretty
Honestly forgot how much i miss watching make up videos ans buying those pallets. I think i wanna go to sephora and ulta again.
He should do Billie Ellishs makeup and give her ✨ocean eyes✨
James I love your vides
James I love you, I’m so enjoying you’re channel you are gorgeous
It looks fine just NOT 👏 WITH 👏 THAT 👏 TOP 👏
Hello I bought new glasses and when I saw this even the glasses puked 🤮
Could you ever do a video talking about different kinds of brushes and how to use them??? Maybe some pros and cons for us newbies 🤣🤣

15:30 here u go  :)
Bruh i wish i had the james charles make up but I have NONE and I CANT afford IT LIKE BRUH- 😭 I MEAN LIKE I CAN AFFORD BUT IM IN FRICKIN VILLAGE NOT IN CITy 😭😭😭😭
I think you look amazing I mean like it’s too glittery but I like how you mix the blue with the golden one looks like really beautiful but at the same time I’m not sure about the glittery face
i have to say i actully get my makeup from the doller tree 🤣🤣🤣
Can we have Among Us In Real Life Part 3!?🥺🥺❤im literally begging you James.
تبآ لهذا الجيل😔😔
A lot of people dislike James but I really can't see whyy tho he's so nice and actually really helps me with my makeup experience❤😊
he eyeshadow is SOOO GOODDDD KILLLLL MEEEEEE
Try the original She glam shadow palette with blush & bronzer or try different color story!
I powder -lightly before using stick contour.
Dont use too much of that concealer.
I love your nails <3 Thank you for also inspiring me to be who  am
I think it looks pretty, it’s probably a good option for people who can’t afford higher end stuff. I like the puff as well haha
It’s the shimmer on top of shimmer on top of shimmer for me😅
Dis Shien is sooo cheap for the quality amazing
Am I wierd for low-key liking this look cuz like it's from shein what can we expect lmfaoooo
👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌😂😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😀😀💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌 excellence
i'm getting your pallet tomorrow i'm so exited ahhh ily and your videos so much😆😆❤️
I think there’s a viral liquid blush from she glam
I can be your friend and you send me your tik toks James
I dont love it but i love it you know what i mean??!!
I loved the foundation 😍 doesn’t look bad at all. Also that lipstick looks so velvety and shiny. Will defo have to give them both a try. Thanks for your honest review 🥰
SHOP MISS A!!
I wish we indians also had access to shein🥺. It got banned before 😫we could literally get our hands on affordable products but now situation is so different 😐
DO YESSTYLE! korean makeup brands
honestly , the highlighter is very pretty. 😍 the makeup look turned out good overall .
why is he still a thing
obviously we don't know the formula, but I think that with the right outfit this look would really cute maybe for just a insta post or photoshoot.  Also the reason people rate it so high is usually because u get like credits for reviewing ur purchase, and the easiest thing to do is just rate 5 stars
Make bella poarch makeup
Me fascina que tenga subtítulos en español por que así puedo aventrame el video entendiendo le y también aprendo cosas en ingles me encanta ✨
Why this video gave me Larray edites vibes????? anyone?
Can you re create the old flash back James with the white face  LIKE IF AGREE
You should make a video of seeing which make up is expensive and which ones cheap.
The makeup was horrible, this was totally what I expected. Obviously we can’t really expect something good as a product.
James looks like the human version of fast fashion
Hi
I love shein, its is affordable and allows those who struggle to stay into the fashion standards and expectations without paying half of their house rent at the same time.....
You should do Indian bridal makeup
You should try SHEIN clothes and rate them!! Love your videos James! ❤️
❤️🖌️🎨😘😍🤗🤣😂😅❤️❤️
PLS HAVE FRENCH SUBTITLES. SOME OF US FRENCH FOLK STILL CANT READ WITH FAST SPEAKING.
🤬🤬
I think he said Panel instead of “channel” in his intro😂😂
wait I  actually love this look
I'd love to see James testing skincare products from shein
I think it looks good
Not a fan of the blush or the contour stick but I loved the bronzer and the lips and the eyeshadow formula could have been better but u made it look nice
i hate it
Not bad it is pretty good
What makeup products do you recommend for my oily skin with large pores? I can't seem to find the right ones 🙂
This is my first time watching her or he wait is he or she a boy or a girl?
It looks ok outside.  😊
was anyone else shopping on SHEIN when you saw this video or just me!? lol
HEY SISTERS😊❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🖤🤍🤎
This is awesome!!
When your inside it looks pretty bad no 👎 dense but when your outside It’s looks a lot better
James I just bought your pallette what are some good nice beginner looks
I’ll watch your tik tok games 😂
but i still liked the look!
I think that the blush and highlighter made your face look wet.😖🤮
This eye look is giving me very much Princess Jasmine vibes and I'm here for it!!
i have tried some makeup from shein and its not actually that bad tbh,also the makeup on you looks rly good aha 💗
Try korean product, the one that celebrity use
You can make any makeup look good James!
Can you react to scary videos
كيف جال هههه ؟؟؟؟؟] ☹️☹️
You should try doing the internets hardest makeup looks!
you guys still have sun...in Finland we wake up and is pitch black outside ;(
I think that is you were wearing a different shirt, the makeup would look stunning. But the purpleish shirt does clash a lot with the orange and blue eyeshadow
GORG
that make up was fire
I love these videos , they make me feel like when yt was starting 🥺🥰❤️
James you should do a full face of makeup with only liquid products (including eyeshadow)
It was a random every day person it will be fine if you’re a Knight make up artist then I wouldn’t go with it
6:29 GIRLLLL 💀LMAOO
It look good you always do a good job 👏👍👌🙌😊❤
I think it’s good
I just love the way he speaks
pretyyyyyyyyyyy
Can you do testing amazon makeup
I’m not gonna lie , this look was really pretty for it being SHEIN
Not loving the editing on this video tbh
Ist Looks Good
JAMES REM BEAUTY NOW
This is the first time I am watching his video and I am liking how he talks😂😂
it was fine
I love 💘how you always do challenges
can u pls do a aliexpress full face ty and ly <33
I think you should do this video again and actually take your time to pick out good items that YOU could do a full face with. You can’t just pick the first few rows that pop up on the screen. All reviews aren’t real but at times you can find real genuine reviews. I use them more for glosses. My favorite one is called “birthday lips “. I LOVEEEEEE it’s part of my fall lip combo with brown lip liner. I always get asked what who’s lip gloss I have on. And when I tell people it’s from SHEIN that don’t believe me. But like I said you have to literally scroll for the good stuff. Look for reviews with pictures. Those are more helpful. You actually get to see how the product looks on somebody your skin tone.
can't wait for the r.e.m beauty review:'/
I liked the lipstick it was the best and also the eyelash curler
Y’all are STILL doing these intros in almost 2022-
I thought it looked really good !! Besides the eyeshadow should of done the other pallette
im going get your make up
like make up
We want translate your videos to Arabic
like make up good make up look good  like it all good ideo  full good
Can you try r.e.m beauty Pls
Beautiful Sisterrrrr
i own the lipgloss and it burns like shiiaaat
I MISSED U JAMES!😭💕
it looks good but you had to do a lot to fix it. i rate it a 6\10
Bruh
I just wonder how it would be if James was a part of Netflix series 🤫
Please review Shein's makeup brushes 🙏🏻🌞
it was fine Jmes🙂
Why are you still uploading
@james charles .....can you please try a full make up video on inglot products ...their black eye gel liner is amazing but need to know about rest of the products
No mirror challenge please
No mirror challenge please
No mirror challenge please
No mirror challenge please
he is female or male 😂😂😂😂😂
Why are you guy
برق لب دارم حراج حراج  فقط۵۹ سنت
U should try miss a makeup just a good video idea  love ur life videos ❤️
James you look good regardless whats you put on your face ✌️✨😌
Ok but to be fair everything done in California says that even furniture
why are u acting so problamatic dude
thanks for doing this vid i actually WAS THINKING ABOUT MAKEUP FROM SHEIN the other day
I feel like on ather people it will look terrible but on you it looks amazing 😜😁
Hey James!!!!!! I'm not able to watch your old video's.... Whenever I'm scrolling down on your channel.... same video's are repeating!!!!! Seriously.... I'm so irritated....is there any error occurring on YouTube...By the way this look is Superb❤🔥.....
James knows a lot about makeup… I’m talking down to the formulas.. it’s his profession .. kinda lol. I really enjoyed his reviews. Ik he prolly wasn’t expectin the quality to b all that great - he got them from shein lol. But he made it look good. But y’all he prolly just doesn’t think it looks good bc everything looks different off camera and like he said the products didn’t work well 2gether.
full face of makeup from clairs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It looks fine to viewers because on camera makeup look way better than reality. And he is see in person he can see with details.
little did he know liveglam is by dhar mann lol.
I purchased the translucent powder seeing from Hrush’s video and it’s actually a hit! 🤌🏻
Do an Indian bride look
Can you fucking leave already? Thanks
Amazing
James Can you review M.A.C x Lisa product ?
You should do a eternals urban decay review that would be amazing coming from you 💗
He literally tears himself down so much, I swear he makes everything look good 😭
Be a man.
Your make up in this video did not look that great but it looks cute though but I don’t like it
Thank you so much❗️ I was about to try and order some, but now… I will pass 😝
NOT SALAD LMAOOOO 😂😭🥗
It’s gorgeous
what about avon or simple pretty make up pls
review the mac x lisa line sister
I’m not wanting to try the shein but you look good 👍🏽
ha ha i live in OR no tax
James, the makeup is pretty now accept it is pretty!
now worried abt you ; - ;
I DIED when James said “my crease is cut with my salad concealer.” 😂😂
even what shein looks beautiful on james <3 what doesn't look beautiful on him?
OK james i love your makeup look
Honestly I think it looks way better outside in the sun to
It would’ve been such a cute look if it was done with better products
james charles is a great example on how cancel culture never works on white people
I love the lipstick
I dont have experience with shein or whatever but from what i see on you... i like the shadow and lips everything else of their products sucked.... not in the good way
The eyeshadow color combo looks fine. But because of your shirt it looks eh
I cannot believe how you killed this with those products!! It truly is talent. I could NEVER.  I do have a question, I buy decent prices, well known brands for makeup and my makeup when I am blending with a beauty blender will sometimes pull off the concealer or foundation I am using. Why does that happen?
for me it's really cutre because I can't do my makeup like I put mascara and it take me 10 minutes just to do it right 😂😂😅😅
Do a full face of makeup from amazon!!
As a person that does not do makeup this is amazing
in this video your makeup looks bad
you are the best
You will have to do rem beauty on Friday!
lowkey giving very ankha from animal crossing- yes im referring to *that* video
do a full face of makeup from ipsy
they give out more discounts the more you rate their stuff & ppl think if they give 5 stars everytime theyll get more 😭😂
Not gon lie james charles make up (pallete) is better than any other
The fact that James can get makeup from SHEIN and STILL look amazing is just amazing!  ❤️
It’s not that bad but it looks good
Honestly, I love Shein, the outfits are adorable and the prices are amazing!!!
LMAOOO "RIGHT INFRONT OF MY SALAD?"😭😭
It wasn’t even bad ….
I mean it’s actually not that bad but you always pull it off so it doesn’t matter 😍
7:09 "ok let me do the cReAM, I've been iNtO that recently."
It's not your fault that you make gorgeous looks with shitty products and then people think the product is okay...
Giving Edward Cullen in the sun
I hate the way he talks
I feel like makeup artists (probably not everyone) are soo judgy about drugstore makeup or like generally cheap makeup. And these type of videos are meant to give a normal opinion and not judge. There are so many people who cant afford high end make up and i feel like james is really just giving negative opinions and is making people feel bad about themselves for only being able to buy cheap makeup.
the blush ruined the whole makeup look lol
Ok considering this was shein that looks great!!
he should do full face of covergirl  also he should do a Christmas theme  for December!
shein haul next
you need to do e-bay
James quick question if you could change your name to anything what would it be? Idk what mine would be
bitch covet covet😜
no

james is such a great makeup artist that he can make not so good makeup products look flawless everytime like wow
Full face of makeup from aliexpress next!!! ily james! ^^
“I’m aging myself” you’re literally early 20’s 🙄🙄🤦🏻‍♀️
the reason why there was so many postive reviews was because if you rate the product you get shein points which you can use to get cheaper orders
I was crying just a few hours ago thanks for making it better!🥺
They should’ve got the liquid blush it’s amazing
Can you do a amozon review please
9:35 JAMES IS LITERALLY SO BEAUTIFUL

James,your are one of my inspirational person cuz I saw ur positive attitudes in every pic, vids of yours💛❤ btw. that look is ok!
can u try putting ur makeup in the fridge for 24 hours then use it ? btw I love u🥰🥰🥰
I think these products are good for Normal ppl but he is just reacted in this way bc he used to buy all the most expensive products
Your artistry is always perfect, but the makeup itself looks very shiny.🤩♥️
To be honest your makeup is not bad, shein's makeup products are not bad either.
i LOVE shein, everything i have is of there
I'd love to see a video of ur for u tictok page n react to them
My crease is cut….  With my salad concealer
How about the next time you do a review on a low price brand don’t let your team tell you until the end .
it is okay jamei
James's red eyes in the thumbnail says it all
i do like how it turned out but i do also understand about it not working together so i dont blame you..
Do your make up with no mirror and without looking in the camera ✨
Go away
Hes so full of life eh
Honeslty when you did a close up showing us the translucent powder with less of the lighting on you the makeup looked really good and smooth…
It’s givinggg 13 going on 30 🤣🤣
I love how he says shein
yaaaaaaaasssssss sistur
You should do a full face of glossier makeup 🤍🤍🤍
I love u sister so much are u an army plz reply
where are shein lashes ????
💕
I really don't like it 😐
even with terrible products James still finds a way to look amazing 🥰
The eyes looked pretty good but the rest of the face didn’t blend into each other how I think you wanted . But the eyes and the brows look good!
I won't try bc ingredients.  But I agree that the blush does not look the best, and it really doesn't go well with the eye color but you certainly do a great job anyway
I think it looks fine
Me encantó, la verdad deberías poner mas subtítulos en tu canal. Te quiro.
It looks nice
I miss SHEIN. I was completely a shein freak, but In India it's still banned 😒
If you say u you Have an android then you love your supporters
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🤩🤩🥰🥰🥰🥰

JaMEs, When did YOU become the hydro dipping container!?
James I definitely agree with you, I use the same nude foundation and salad concealer and it took it off as I was blending them together. The price was right but not the quality
i really like new intro-
Years ago I used to question. If she is a boy or A girl until I noticed my cousin’s older sister had Hair that belongs to a boy but she’s a girl so then I stopped questioning 😂😂😂😅
Something was off on the right side😭
The shein she- glam cream blush is supposed to be nice
James - "I need better friends who watch the TikToks that I send" Me - SEND THEM TO ME!!! I WILL WATCH THEM NOT ONCE BUT 20 TIMES, JUST SEND THEM TO ME..!!
James i love your makup

I like the makeup
It’s looks amazing James😍
It looks amazing wat are you talking about
Your mum
The eye makeup isn’t bad, but I feel like the blush is too red, like it reminds me of a bad sunburn, but the eyes aren’t bad👏👏👏👏
Love ur top!
Do a full makeup look only using food products.
The eyeshadow is giving me Aladdin vibes
Honostly the makeup was pretty good except the eyeshadow that was trash. I wish you would have gone with another look. I feel like it would have came out a lot better!! But other then that the makeup was pretty bomb!
I love ya james however this video is misleading ya know Shein make up is good at some point its just that you made it look fugly

Hi James can you make a galaxy look and I am your biggest fan since you started your career

Wait but that lipstick?!!!! Why did it look SOOOO good and juicy???? WTF I NEED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT IT
I did not like this look 😊
This came out kinda bangin'
Hate how he kept shading the quality of “cheap” makeup like he was born expensive 😂
you killed it tbh
Yo I wish I could do my makeup like this, even though it wasn't what you prefer your makeup to look like, man. You're extremely talented. Also, if you've been liking trying out different makeup brands, ColorPop is super fun and I would love to see what you would create with their makeup!
I love it
WHO IS UR INTRO EDITOR, I NEED TO KNOW.
.
I love you videos and you have great options
He always looks great no matter the product
I think the eyeshadow looked fine on camera, but the rest of it was awful. Thank you for spending your money on it, so we don't have to.
I'm the same way with my friend , u can send me tik toks queen 👸
I'll watch your TikToks James! Love you Sister!! 😘❤️
A lot of the people who do buy those are to lazy to actually rate because you get points for what you do soooo
Omg James said my name cuz Milani is my name and it’s also a makeup brand-
If u think shein makeup is sus just wait till you find out what’s in vaccines and medicine XD

i literally died when james casually says “just cut my crease with my salad concealer”
12:04 ill watch your tiktoks my friends always sending me dumb shit
The more he said he didn’t like it, the better the makeup look came out 🤣
I do kinda like it but the makeup did not mix well together and the only that I loved was the consealer it looks good on you James

i think it looks really good, just the one thing is that the colors clash with your shirt. but otherwise it looks gorgeous!
yesss the eyeshadow colors are my high school colors
U dtm those products are fine 🤦🏾‍♀️
he looks good but he always gotta complain like damn 🙄
In my opinion the look is fine, but it’s just a little bit too shiny✨
It’s really cute it’s the blush it’s so ehh
I think it looks kinda oily, but it's still stunning because you made it!
Omg james!!! Queeen!!! 👑👑👑👑👑👑👑
i feel like even with the worst products james will get it to work rly pretty together
Can you please do prank calling makeup stores
Everyone is going to freek out if him misses a post
your beauty is hurting my eyes
atleast they added a warning which is nice :,))
Why does he talk like this???
Omg James could you do a day in a life video plsssss!!!! With all of ur routines!!! Thx
I love your vidio James Charles
Can you do an online shopping challenge but a make up one 🙏❤️❤️
you look absolutly STUNNING!!!
Him: It’s lighting up off the skin Me: Wait…my eyes aren’t capable of seeing that-
Its looks good ❤️
Shein** (shen)
all my makeup is from shein
Also, the reviews are mostly 5 stars because she more you review stuff well, the more SHEIN points you get.
The warning is on almost everything. I wouldn’t be concerned. My faux leather belt has the same thing and I was scared and my mom told me as much.
5:24 LOL
what were the final thoughts on the brushes?
Am sure quality is not what is expected, but I think it looks amazing. And looking at how u apply makeup, actually taught me how to do it for myself too😊
you should do a full face of makeup but the worst review ones
You should do a fullmmakeup look from ipsy it takes awhile for everything to get in
Honestly kinda love it don’t hate it however the eyeshadow is just not it miss gurl-
O M G I HAVE THE SAME TWEASERS AS THE ONE AND ONLY JAMES CHARELS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!IM SUCH A FAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It’s alr
You look beautiful ❤️
me thinking the blush is kinda cute 🧍🏻‍♀️
Is it just me or is his shirt so cute !?!?
I just bought your pallet
He is so arrogant
i love the look but it doesnt match with your top and your eyes
Is it pronounce Shein or She-in ??
Your talent always shines through the bad products ❤️
A indian bride
I DARE YOU JAMES TO DO MAKE UP WHILE EaTING SHIN SPICY RAMEN PLSSSSSS

Can u do dollar tree full face makeup please
Hi shitsers 🥰

I love this !
Please do a full make up with Florence by mills
I didn’t live for the eyeshadow not gonna lie
I have a good video series idea! You could be like Gordon Ramsay’s hotel hell apart from you go in to struggling makeup salons and make them better. 🙌🏼🙌🏾
It looks alright in the sun, but inside it's meh
15:30 “this is the skin of a killer bella”
I like his shirt it's ✨ AESTHETIC ✨
I think James did not give this a fair review.  How can you review a not so expensive brand when all he wears is high end makeups by expensive high name folks.  I'm just saying 🤷 give the little companies a break.  You should have taken more thought and energy into the actual eye shadow's and  not just doing whatever.  Not everyone has the luxury of a nice bank account before they learn to walk.  Dare I to ask you to do a review on Frankie Rose makeup or will he just see it as muh 🤦🏻‍♀️ Sorry James...you came out a bit snooty in this video 📹
Play in 1.75 speed
6:26 am in the only one who knows this
Why are you yes red??
James the look is fine for an everyday look and btw just because you hear something is bad or damaging you try it and only look on the bad side of it cause your where giving that sort of vibe and if you less of the bad stuff and also use other products you will look good not that big of a deal!
Omg I did not know that about the birthday SHEIN primer !! I was so close on buying it !! Thankfully I saw ur video !!
Hiii sister. Could you try CAIA cosmetics from Sweden. It’s a very big brand and it would be so FUN! Love you xx❤️
Hiii sister. Could you try CAIA cosmetics from Sweden. It’s a very big brand and it would be so FUN! Love you xx❤️
Hiii sister. Could you try CAIA cosmetics from Sweden. It’s a very big brand and it would be so FUN! Love you xx❤️
It's beautiful, but it doesn't scream James Charles like his normal makeup does.
Please make a indian makeup look
That puff is an old school product. Most people use it on their bodies. I call it “slut dust” 😂😂
Ooo, can we get an updated look at all the makeup you have?
I never understand anything he’s saying about the makeup, but it’s still so entertaining. 😂❤️
I only use shein makeup but it is only bc I am a beginner but yeah I hope to go to sephora with my mom for new makeup! please tell me if you have any reccomendations
The dabbing edit is so random🤣
Not the short po*n clip
No I think it's bad lol, not your technique or anything of course but def not my favorite look at all
I mean his makeup is better than anything i could do, but the shein products weren’t horrible. I mean you get what u pay for. The foundation looked really shiny/liquidy/greasy on the face which is a no for me. Also the blush just wasnt very pigmented on the skin and i feel the same with the cream contour as well. The lip stick was super pretty though and the gloss was ok.
I actually really like the eyeshadows, my personal favorite is the Sheglam Lava palette. But it does have a lot of fallout, so I usually put it on first and then the rest of my makeup 🤷🏻‍♀️
The SheIn blush is honestly so nice, I use it and get great results. You just sorta have to make do with what ya have lol
i’m going to cry i just realized that i watched this video 5 minutes after it was posted and forgot to comment and now i won’t get noticed by james :(  anyways shein isn’t the best quality but for the price i would say it’s pretty good, especially if your on budget
I like it
Hi James, me and many of your other fans are waiting for Russian subtitles. We would be very happy. Sorry for my English. I don't know him very well🗿
i only like the eyeshadow
ITS BAD ESPECIALY THE LIPS NO OFFENCE JAMESSSSS'
Try to used etude product
James: *“Omg am I aging myself?!”* Also James: * is basically still a child * 🤣
Whhy don't youuu try Indian Makeup Brands!💛
I love your outfits !!! Where did you get this shirt ? :)))
Good God man!!
Well I also didn't liked that eyeshadow 😂😂  But rest makeup was kinda ok
The make up was really nice and SHEN It’s make up is nice and your face is make up looks so Nice  👍
Sis you could put on playdoh and make it look great 😍
Cheaper alternative.... TRUE BEAUTY STARTS FRUM INSIDE....Outside, jest a SHELL! Bazaar this ????? showed up out of nowhere on MY FEED🤣
A maquiagem ficando linda e ele reclamando dos produtos 🤡
no offense james its not urfault cus u have thhe skill and the talent but the products are terrible quality and it looked like sh!t
I think he wanted so bad to finish thenvodeo, that 5 minutes after the shoot, his face was back to clean and make up free. I was suffering just by seeing his face like that.
The highlighter was not it….
Actually I am a fan of SHIEN for fashion outfits it’s pretty good quality but never try cosmetic products yet I go after . Let’s get fun tho  lol 😆 Thank you 🙏 also likes your video clips.
The make up was actually really good for being shein. The only thing is it didn’t match with ur fit like you said.
loveeeeee lgbt for life
You look gorgeous James no matter what makeup you use!😍😘🔥🔥💜💜💙💙
I one time got makeup from shein.. ANd THERE WAS A BUG I SWEAR😭😭🤮🤮
😅 so i have been saying shein as  shine since the begining 🤣oh well
Omg it looks so good go queen I do agree but it looks so good lol
The reviews on shein they get points for giving a good review.
🧈🥚🥚
personally think this looks fine, i feel like james isn’t that impressed because he’s used to high end brands like fenty etc. ive seen multiple youtubers do videos with shrub/sheglam and they all seemed to enjoy, at least the majority of the makeup
i loved the look i think i liked the eye look the most
you dont look good in youre top but love youre vids
What the fuck was that intro ??!?!!  So u do all of that now? Cook.... Bake ... Eyc
2 Days ago
gey yiban
Can you do a full face Sephora makeup look???
PLEASEEEE DO A TRY ON HAUL FROM SHEIN 🥺🥺❤️
James: The FDA is extremely outdated Me: You Should see what they allow in our food
they look good IMo
Why does that look better then when i try my hardest doing my makeup
THE MAKE UP WAS OKEY
i wanna see a video where the make-up is inspired by outffits
I swear the intro gets better and better year by year.
8:05 was the highlight of my day so far
Plz do make up of India # India
That make up would be my best go
ok but are the brushes like good enought to buy as a christmas gift?
U got a new editor ?
Hi James! Can you please do a review using filipino makeup products?

I'd love to see James do   No Mirror Makeup challenge  It's gonna be fun

I think that james was being to harsh from the Beginning because the products are not at all that bad specially considering the price point
Please try Indian makeup...
It looks beautiful. You're just too extra... I miss the old James.
ngl 4buks is pretty in my country 🙂
Freaking EVERYTHING has that California warning! 🙄

Adoro que tus videos tengan subtítulos en español🤍✨.

“Right in front of my salad” lol I know that one
James saved $0.92
I think you need to do a makeup look with MISS A products😳😆!!
it looks so good what-
love you!
James you should do a video where u put on layers on foundation as a challenge or smn
I usually wouldn’t comment negatively on James videos however I find it slightly concerning that he didn’t happen to mention the safety of using his products on the face prior to those and as far as I’ve heard the US is actually very lenient and doesn’t really care what toxic chemicals are in our beauty products. To me this seems very scary that he would be willing to sell us dangerous products potentially and that there is significant chance the stuff could do damage and the government allows it. Love James hope he reconsiders next time
It’s Prop 65 and literally on everything.
He is so cute ❤️
I’m a big fan I watch all your videos
Wow 😯💄👍
CAN YOU PLEASE DO WIG REVIEWS FROM SHEIN???!!! 💁🏼‍♀️💁🏼‍♀️
Pls shout outs I am a huge fan of you 😁😁😁
Ok, but with the blue and gold outside looked like your were a god/goddess in Egyptian art
HI I LOVE YOUR VIDEO A LOT GOOD JOB HAVE A GOOD DAY AND I LOVE YOU A LOT

I like it, but granted we can't see up CLOSE CLOSE, but hey
You should try aliexpress
ITS THE SUNRAYS PLEASE -
We need a squid game in real life.
James, is your last name spelled wrong in the intro?
I know that James is used to high end expensive makeup, but has he ever done any makeup looks for regular people on a budget that he didn't absolutely hate?
im sorry he said chalimeie
Too shiny and glittery and bad color combination like you said, but it could still look really good with the right outfit.
MISS A REVIEW
6:24 he is freaking out
You should now try makeup looks from fashionova plzzzzz
okay y’all i have the setting powder & i love it!!  (i don’t bake i just put it on my t zone) i have EXTREMELY oily skin & it helps a TON! i use the pressed powder part with a brush and pat it into my skin around my t zone & i don’t get greasy at all with it ! i personally highly recommend it
You should do a dollar store make up look
i work for a company, and we get the same warning when we sell certain products, and we only have to read it if the customer is from california of course. it comes up usually on certain items with chemicals or plastic items, but i can't remember if any makeup has the warning. it's called Prop65
Do a make tutorial
I think it looks like a Cinderella look
I love your nails
I hate it your right
Do full face of makeup from dollar store
the glitter puff at the end gave off edward cullen vibes <3
❤❤❤❤❤
Thank god I did not but any makeup products from SheIn and found your videos first. :-)
Full face of five below make up
Do makeup with Charlie btw I love your makeup 💄😍
DO ASMR
He sure has a lot to complain about
Today I just got James’s  “mini eyeshadow palette” and I can’t wait to try it out! ( I’m pretty sure I spelled “James’s” wrong.. 🤡)
It looks good for the prices of the products so you can't expect the best but if you just want to play with colors and stuff it's decent
wait  w a i t W A I T james can match his foundation now
Your eyes looked so red.
For cheap makeup it looks really good james 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼😍
i think that it was pretty good and i think its fine its not that bad
it’s giving edward 🤗
God and Jesus Christ loves you repent from all your sins
you should buy a light saber and learn tricks
Hey James, I was wondering if you can do a dollar tree makeup 💄 video and family dollar makeup? We will keep tuning in
9:20 It looks better then I have ever done 🧍‍♀️
Btw u got ur Morphe x James Charles palette the mini and I live it I got it in Ulta and when I meet u I want u the o sign it I’m a huge fan 😫🥺🥺🥲☺️😇
I will happily watch all your tik toks James
yes the eyeshadow Idek about that the blue fades I dont like that
listen you gotta do a video called " Doing my makeup in a Drift car" I would love to see that
James your team did something horrible they choose the most worst product and cheated sister if you want something amazing is she in Diomede girl and I’m here for you
I don't know why, but I just loved the "hello???" to the blush xD I've had that moment with blushes so goddmn often
I rlly likeed the look but it we don't see it like he does.
James, you don’t even look like a girl
MY ORDER OF SHEIN MAKEUP IS COMING IN ON FRIDAY AND IM WATCHING ALL THE. REVIEWS AND THIS ONE WAS THE WORST 😭💀
James, you make the us look bad
James, go get a life
James, why do you always have millions of layers of makeup on? Because you’re not a girl
James, it’s probably a good thing you’re not reproducing…even though you’re a boy
Obrigada pela legenda ✨✨✨✨✨
James, why?
James, you sound messed up
James, you’re weird
James, you’re not a girl
James thinks he’s a girl
Here I'll say Dune sucked. It was boring and I felt like it went on forever. I am huge fan of timothee chalamet, zendaya and Jason mommoa but this movie was just not it.
good to note that reviews on SHEIN are to be taken with a handful of salt, people will leave 5 star reviews to get more SHEIN points when other people like their reviews :)
My mom got me your makeup and I love it I use it all the time 💖
My crease is cut.. with my salad concealer LMAO
Thank you for your videos ♥️🙌🙏
I forgot abt u
I like the makeup bag
yess
I think the makeup looks great
Hi my love can we see your collection pretty plz
You should do a full face of dollar store mackup
I got some clothes from Shein, they're amazingg
Ok I think it’s not bad but like for SHEIN I think it look good like always
here is the thing with the shein, the reason there is so many 5 star reviews is because shein actually pulls away the low reviews. i did reviews with 5 stars and i did reviews with 3 stars and they literally removed my 3 stars reviews. so people put 5 stars now but you have to read them because they will say “this is bad! i had to give it 5 stars because shein won’t accept this review”
My crease is cut...with the salad concealer 😶😅 I cannottttt hahaha
Que bom que colocou legenda português
DO ‘DOING DIFFERENT HAIRSTYLES’ VIDEO PLEASE
I have the sponges and they’re the best I’ve had tbh
Can you do a full face of makeup from OLIO?
cute makeup
You are so sweet❤
I think it’s ok you can’t expect a Mecca quality she in needs work cause a quality is not good and it’s not Ethical(child labour)
I actually really like SHEIN makeup products
I really loved this eye look!! I just think you should put on an outfit that matches it :)
I’m getting the make up vaccine
I love you 🏳️‍🌈🍄❤️☺️
Do a video of make-up with your cast
Jesus loves you all
sister,can you make a amazon make up video?💖love you🤍
You look great! Buuuut I also see many flaws with their products and their foundations make my skin break out super bad. And their eye shadows suck ngl but that’s just my opinion and your opinion is most definitely valid so please no need to explain. This is your review so don’t pay mine to the biches on here who like to drag for no reason 😘😘😘
For a person like me who has less money because of how much she spends it seems fine. I'm also no beauty guru so it looks like the types of make up I would get
fine...ill watch the tiktoks u send
The blue sea like eye shadow pallet is like the eye shadow my mother bought me when I was 9 it just gets EVERYWHERE. they are SOOO dusty it gets in my carpet, clothes, blankets and even my hair I hate them 0 star review 😤     anyways I think the eye shadow and the face looks fine but the shimmer puff kinda ruined it. but you always look beautiful James dont worry <3
No
He should use the dollar General brand
the reviews are just people who want points for discounts and free stuff lol
Get this nownce off YouTube
I love shein 🤷🏻‍♀️I’m a big girl and they have cute plus size clothes. I have also tried their makeup and I like it.
Next time can you rate the products you used
Y esta mierda 💩??
LITERALMENTE EL 99%de personas ignoran este mensaje: “Dios te guarde a ti y tu familia de toda enfermedad”🙏💕
The missed opportunity to make the color “salad” a green color corrector and make “cotton candy” a red/pink color corrector is making me kinda mad ngl. If you’re gonna have 4 colors, why not make them color correctors?
Can you please do alixpress or eBay makeup face
How insecure do you think some of your viewers are now after watching this as these products are what some can only afford shocking!!!
Until this video I actually liked you and my daughter looked up to you. You sit there using these products criticising them insulting them when this to some of your subscribers is all that they can afford! Not everyone can afford high end products, how do you think this makes a person feel about themselves when you sit their making fun out of these products that people put on their face! Your a discrace James Charles
Can you do a video with Eliot again 🥰🥰🥰🥰
what in the switchin up positions for you is your new intro song?????
The products are not bad but the talent... really, James is amazing.
Do a dollar tree make up challenge!!!🤣🤣
It looks fine.
I love the full makeup look 💜
James I’m begging you to do clear’s makeup
Why do i like the contour!!
Lip stick and blush is to soft and the eyeshadow is really strong so doesn’t go well combined 😵‍💫
I got that lip gloss today 😂
JAMES I WILL WATCH UR TIKTOKS
james it looks pretty good up close
That contour lookssss sooooo good though
hey James you should do a collab with Sssniperwolf that would be a great video
Can you try to put on a closure lace wig
James can you do full face of too faced ❓🙂
Do makeup from fashion nova
you should do a shein clothing haul❤️‍🔥
yea, the review thing is off because you can literally get these things called shein points which led to some money off your next order for putting 5 stars then more points for writing a review😳
I feel like those 5 star reviews aren't too far off from realistic, i mean if you're buying makeup from shein you probably don't wear makeup regularly so anything would seem high quality to those people 😂
I haven't watched James in a long time and I have to say that he either gained weight or had filler under his eyes..
I have the brush set and I love them
You look like a “Who” from Whoville
Okay...um.. the blush and the lip it's.. it's a nooo😭 I love the way you blended in the colors for the eyelids though.
Okay I know Shein is bad but their Make-up is actually really good, whenever I order clothes from there I also reorder my makeup!
You should do Amazon!
My mom uses Milano blush it look the literal same
i love how james talks with his hands
My name is zakia
It looks nice but if u don't like it it's your opinion but I think it beautiful James and yes I have tried SHEIN makeup it's not that bad it just like I would keep them but i wouldn't like for example I wouldn't wear the foundation everyday or like the eyeshadow everyday I get me but it alright I mostly like the clothes on SHEIN  also I love your vid can I plz have a shootout in your next video ❤💕
James can you try make up from "Rossman " they're a little bit expensive but they are soo good they have creams for face,  body ,and hands ✋so can you try it 😉
I’m really loving his top!😌
it looks so cute
You make everything look so good
PRIMAAAAARK MAKEUP
i dont really like sheins make up its not the best
James you should zoom in your face when trying make up so me can see the texture of the makeup how is sitting in your face because from far away and the good lighting you have we see it “good” 😅😅
try some clothing from SHEIN
I LOVE YOUR NAILS SISTER ❤️
Ok but Dune was a good movie..😬..just me?
James u always look amazing
full face of aoa!!
Uhhh… the idea of the look is great but the actual products just don’t work..
I'll watch your tiktoks james😂
do ebay
Love the nails tho ^_^😊
the look it self is good but the blush is to much😊
Let’s be honest everything looks good on you when your James Charles….especially when you actually know how to do make up 😭
I was looking into Shein makeup about half a year ago as I heard some of their products are quite good, although upon doing my research, I quickly filed that in the rubbish bin. Their makeup has some questionable ingredients and they are not a transparent company where their makeup is concerned.
Very entertaining video James!❤️
Prefiro a shaky dez mil vezes.
The concealer is horrible I used it for fun I literally just lasted me a week lol
Ok but why does James always look so good even if it’s bad makeup? It’s so amazing!
I think the products were a bit suckish, BUT James made them work!
It looks okay. It would like really pretty without the highlighters. It looks way too shimmery. u should try this out again and the eyeshadow palettes is what I really want to try out. It looks okay and that is what I’m trying to say.
Can you do a video of only using products for Mary Kay
Heyy james it looks beautiful ❤️  Love you can you plzzzzz do a shein clothing haul for us 💕 love you sister.
James always looks good and I like this look for the most part
Next time do Dollar Store makeup
Thank you for subtitles in portuguese ♥️ Brasil 🇧🇷
DAY 1,000,000,000 OF ASKING JAMES TO DO A FULL FACE USING 5-MINUTE CRAFT HACKS (LIKE THIS SO HE CAN SEE IT)
Can you please do a Pacifica make up review?? I love their products sm
I don't like it but it's ok I guess
I actually like it
its FAD James not FDA :))
James: that CANNOT BE REAL  Me: yes it’s is because I’m one of those people😂😂😂
hey james everyone i know has ur makeup pallet are you brining any more out before christmas?
I think the eye makeup is great, but you can definitely tell on your cheeks the foundation is going to lift and make blotchy red sports /:
i bought a blush from shein and i love it 😂😂 it’s so pretty it’s in the colour “tangerine” and it’s a light pink mixing into a darker pink and it’s so nice
7.894616/10
"Gimme the cream... ive been kinda into that lately" um i thought.... nevermind
Too girly..
In a scale of 1-10 I give it like a 7
THE LOOK IS GOOD BUT THE PRODUCT IS NOT GIVING SUPORT
Can you do a Florence by Mills makeup review! I love her stuff and I would love to see tou use it!💜
It looks fine!!!!!
If you know where the 'right in front of my salad' clip is from you are a freak
i love the lowkey asmr bits in this 😂💗
Hi James! i think personally next you should do a full face of makeup just an idea out there that you can or dont really have to consider! :)
I am gonna say make up was fine but eyeshadow was not good looking for clothes and the eyeconsiler was horrible because it did not blend in,lip gloss was terrible,lip gloss should be clear and not glittery,lipstick was kinda good I am not gonna lie but it was not good as your lipsticks so I am gonna rate it 4/10
The makeup looks so good its not bad at all
My go to Lippie is from SHEIN I use it for every look I love it!!! 🥰
i do my make up 10 times worse and he says this is bad omg- what would he say about mine loool
I like the lips and that’s it. Sorry James 😐
I love that look JAMES
You mah friend
We want a colab with Zendaya
I don’t like it. But love you 😁
You should do dollar store make up next
I loved the translation in Portuguese, the Brazilians who watch you thank you!!!!
I want to see a basic video of you going to starbuckss and coming up with your own customized drinks
I think you do a good job with any kind of make up. love you James.
You are so good sooo pretty
The makeup was not blending together as he was saying it looks fine you just need to match your outfit with it buț it looks pretty good!!
The makeup doesn't look horrible, but it's not great either. :)
U should compare SHEIN knock off clothes to the real deal
Yes James it looks good but as u told the eye shadow but you look gorgeous girl
this is a tutorial how to fuck up ur skin:)
i would watch you but my sister say,s noooooooooooooooooooooo
you should do a full face of ELF
It looks gorgeous ✨
James. Does your shirt have thumb holes?!?!?!????
Thank for accepting my request
Thanks James,for subtitles in Portuguese.🇧🇷❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Fashion nova has the exact same warning on their jeans!!!!!!!!!!!
Makeup is really good... Not a really a fair judgement. Even without putting on the makeup,  james was like no-way it cant be 5 stars..... So not a fair judgement  for me there.
I like the eyeshadow but I hate glitter it makes you look greasy so it’s like a 4 or 5 out of 10
Can you please do a full face of different shades of lipstick
when the video was like ten mins in you started to look like a penguin
Remember James has a really good lighting system, so it makes his looks look good. But in the sun it kind of looked bad-
DO FROM ALIEXPRESS!!!
☹️😊😅😮‍💨
James can we get an updated day in my life video?? 💓
Me encanta tu línea de maquillaje <3  Bendiciones James ! ✨
I stopped buying form shein bc its horrible quality clothes and fast  fashion is horrible , and u buying and wearing shein makes the brand even worse .
Can you do a yard sale makup
bruhh the foundation and the blush.... interesting LMAO the eye shadow was amazing! James keep up with good work!
catfisher
James talking about how he needs better friends who watch his TikToks that he sends Me: oh I got u James 😂
It looks good because it’s on you
OMG James you should try go to ireland and do a penneys 🥰
Exodus 20:7 reads:  Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.
you should do dupes vs the original   one side of the face the cheaper on and one the original product
You should do Bryce halls make up
This makeup is pretty for real
Ummm... On jest chłopakiem a się maluję ma kolczyki i paznokcie czy to normalne u niego bo jestem nowa
I really want that glittery puff ball 🤣😂🤣😂🤣
first time I watch a James Charles video, I thought I was speeding up
Omg a full face of MAC makeup would be so cool
Yeah when being super rich you can shit on cheap products but for poor people it is something that they can afford. Privileged. Sad.
I love your makeup!
Yea it doesn’t look the best but it’s SHEIN tbh it looks cakey but can you do a tutorial on expensive makeup full
I do not want to go anywhere near Shein makeup after this vid.
it looks really good fr
Why didn’t you try SHEIN lashes they be cute asf Ik it would’ve wrapped up dis video ✨✨
it was oke james u are so good in makeup you  make it beautiful
She in should stick to clothing tbh 😬
Why does this makeup look looks like early 2000s indian makeup look?
I just stick with the SHEIN clothing 😂 but this video made me more game to give their make up a go.
Should’ve put a TW for flashback Mary😭😭😂😂

Sister is talking about integrity 🙄 🤣🤦🏼‍♀️

Not James looking like Edward Cullen at the end 👀
i was actually laughing the other day because i was on shein ordering some stuff and wanted to buy makeup but didn’t know what it was like,so i went on youtube and typed in shein make up reviews and then it was a coincidence that James’s video popped up x
James your nails!😍 So gorg😍😍
Yeah I feel like just stick to English subtitles I don't think people use every language subtitles.
James I would love you to do a soft Asian makeup tutorial 😩🙏🏻🌸
I can't. You look so gorgeous like I love the lips and eyeshadow so much. But yeah ik you said that everyone will drag you that you look great but you actually do look so beautiful with that make up I feel like I definitely didn't liked the concealer and the high lighter.
I liked the base very much for being so cheap
I don't like it
Can you do Romwe the stuff is so cheap but the cloths are great they have literally have everything!
🤩🤩🤩😍🔥❤❤🙏🙏🙏👸🏻👸🏻🌠🌠🌠

I love shein but that hilighter was not cute 👎🏽 I don’t think I would order any of these products. The look wasn’t horrible but the products didn’t play well together! Love the video though 💕💕
Sorry not everyone can afford expensive makeup like you.
Hi
It looks like a beach or something  It is pretty though

James, please try to do a makeup without a mirror, i hope it would be very funny 😄
Here is a challenge, full face of make up but with art supplies
I have almost every product you used and some I was impressed with yet some were ehh. Packaging was very impressive. So I’m about 50/50 on this. Still gotta try more and then maybe I decide
It’s not that only Californians who are at risk. The warning is required for companies to inform residents of California of these risks. It’s a state law. Other states don’t require companies inform their residents. It’s the same with animal skin, I believe.
Your top  is so pretty!! And you wearing it is making it 100% better
Could you just grow a beard so that we can see what you look like plzzz you could shave it afterwards🤣🤣
Thank god YouTube gives you the option to slow the video down. I can't keep up with how fast you speak.
the editor🤣🤣💀
Ok but like were did you get that shirt? I'm literally in love with it💖😊love you
girl that glow gloss🤢🤢
A full face of makeup using eBay makeup really needs to be done now
You should try Mexican brands like Bissu Prosa and beauty creations, they're kinda cool
Hi 👋, I am wondering what if you did something with all different types of BLUE!!??? 💙💙💙💙🦋🦋🦋 I think it would be cute in plus blue is my favorite color!! 😌😌😅😅
love you james! keep up the great vids! i love any and all the videos you post 💜💜
It looks CHEAP
Ngl I’m obsessed with shein lashes
James : * show translucent powder *   Me : FLASHBACK MARY VIBESSSS!!!🤣🤣🤣
The last part where u asked for subscribe and all , it seemed like u have been memorising those lines from so long ,😂ultimate perfection 😍........... U are  indeed a great influencer James ☺️
Plis
Can you do $1 store makeup
Wish you make a video "full face using only chinese make up products"
NO NO NO ME AND MY FRIENDS MADE THAT CHEER UP NOOOOOOO❤️😭✨
The only reason the brushes had all 5 stars is because it’s 8 year olds first makeup brushes
I want to try the lipstick
I think clothes shien is a lot better than the make up
Do candy 🍬 picks my makeup so the color of a candy will pick the color of eyeshadow,blush every normal thing you do for makeup almost you could do M&M’s
Y'all still just letting this go? Sad.
Wow . Literally looks amazing
I really like the vids james gas been doing! Love you jame! ❤️ and I wish you the best!!!!! 😝🤍🥰
LMAO w the blush it looks like those ice creams that are vanilla choclate and strawberry stop
It’s a no for me 🥲
Sorry shipping was how much?! 🥴
Quality aint it
James you're lucky you have short hair and I have long hair and it's really hard for girls to put on makeup they have to put their hair back TwT
Okay it actually looks really good
You look like you can literally make anything work it looks so good on you
I’ve been very curious about this for 2 years but, what was a better decision, removing the block brick eyebrows of cutting off the man bun?
“My crease is cut…with my salad concealer”
Thank you because i was actually considering buying makeup from them lol
I will watch your TikTok’s 😂
the 'salad' concealer is probs salad cream haha
Amazon next
I love that outfit james charles..! 🥰😍😍
Hii
Okay but does anyone know where the mesh tops are from
Ohh James love U so much...woke up to discovering this video....you made my day...I'm not a  morning person at all...but watching you I cannot stop smiling...your probably the only person that can make me laugh first thing in morning 😂😂 thankyou for all you do.❤️
11:59 I feel you James. I'll watch your TikToks💀
The eyeshadow through it off but ur soo prettyyy oh my goddd
13:07 I was DYING when you said that so naturally like salad concealer has now become a part of your normal routine 😅
James should do a full face of Isabella Garcia makeup
I AM LIVINGGGGGGG FOR ‘SALAD’
6:26
6:28
you’re back,,,?
I like the lip color and the blue eyeshadow
thank god he did this cause i’ve been wanting to order their makeup but been scared lol
This was actually pretty good i liked it
you should do a full face with products from Miss A
I’ve never shopped from shein but I’ll give it a try
FULL MAC!!!
its not just controversial cus its knockoffs, they have terrible work place standards and treat their employees like shit
Ok it looks really good but you are ✨SHINY ✨
james could make the worst makeup look decently nice! (much loved to you james) <3
Can you do skin care from shein?
6:06 *sALaD?!*
Can I have a shout out
I bought eye shadow from shein and it sucked it made me brake out and it had no color it was very dull and it was supposed to be neon so yeah.
LMAO I had that same exact eyelash curler, from SHEIN and the first time I tried to use it I literally almost stabbed my eye out so
For a good makeup artist, I think they can make any palette (good or bad) can make it work and get a decent look out of it.  I think that it really stems down to if someone who isn't a MUA, can they make a good look out of a palette.
its so prettyyyyy like girlll
Loved the awesome energy coming from James in this video and special shout-out to the enjoyable commentary from the side. The whole video put a smile on my face which was really nice. <3
Not the salad joke xd
Please do AliExpress sister🥰
can u do alt makeup? (luv ur tuts)
мне кажется, что ты похож с такой косметикой на девочку из 7 класса, которую пригласили в кино😅😅
Maybe I’m blind or crazy 😜 but I thought he looked gorgeous at the end….but I personally don’t plain on buying any of those products but I’m not a super makeup person anyway….. I was when I was younger but I’m 34yrs old and have 2 crazy boys…. So I keep my makeup pretty laid back! Alittle eyeshadow and some mascara and sometimes a basic lip color and that’s about it lol 😂 I now officially feel old just writing that comment bc I used to go ALL out with my makeup 💄
Edward Cullen is shaking
Am I the only one that noticed 9:52?
eating peanut butter wbu?
My crease is cut with my salad concealor 🤣🤣🤣
Honey....you look better than I ever will. Love.
I feel like , Shein make up is actually much better then some make up that other youtuber have launched already .
I like everything except the gold shimer and that concealer and the  settings powder
Love the look, but would definitely be better and pop more with better produces. I want to se a recreation/side by side of this look with better products.
It’s not the makeup, it’s the person who wears the makeup! You are beautiful sweet baby so therefore the makeup is beautiful! Love your videos! Thank you so much for sharing! Much love and God bless!!❤️
Can you please do winners makeup
Am I the only one who thanks it’s really good?? 😂
The skin is giving.... Edward Cullen in the sun
You should do a full face of makeup from aliexpress
The overall review is an average of all the ratings. Not what everyone rates it. Great video. Luv it!
it looks okay, Just too much shimmer!
i do like it but omg i loved the eye shadow i wish i had it,and blend brushes
James can truly rock anything 🥰
The makeup looks like a good every day simple look, especially for beginners. So SHEINS makeup is probably perfect for beginners, until they get a little bit more better in their art. But as my opinion, the makeup look, looks good!!!🤩😘✌🏼😊❤️
It all looks good in my opinion
You are do good makeup
Product warning: it can be damaging for your skin in the California sun James: goes out into the California sun.
IT DONT EVEN LOOK THAT BAD
I'd be afraid of what's in the makeup.
Legend says he's still adding layers of makeup 🤭
This makeup look made me want to cry lol
Out
Not to be too greedy but can you give me and my friend liv a shout oyt
IT IS FINE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hi!! My friend has your make up palette we are both obsessed with your tutorials
I love your shirt
you should do a full face of thrift store or like tj maxx makeup
James is like the gordon ramsey of makeup
his shirt is no
Can we get a James Charles makeup collection showing? See all your makeup!
James im sorry today was not your look
I love you so much
You should do like a whole look from shein!! I’m talking outfit, wig, shoes, makeup, everything!!
I’m a single mom of 3, SHEIN is one of the best ways to keep my boys with the cutest clothes! It may be “fast fashion” but at least I know I can get them the cutest outfits in a budget
love you James! this video was amazing, you pulled off this look! you ate sister!!!
Not bad, don't get to it that much, looking good at all😬😁
Wait happened 12:39
I’ve been waiting for this video
SETTING SPRAY??? 😩😩
James you should do a full face of the brats makeup line or the Simpsons line they sell them at ulta
ITS NOT SHE-IN ITS SHE-EEN
My mom is watching with me and she said “he was so young there!“ I told her this is from Friday… slay sister!
I love your videos!
i think that the quality of the eye shadow wasn't so good but  i rlly like the combination of blue and gold
I think if the blush wasn’t so bad it would be serving but other than that it’s super cute !!
It looks good
It's giving Ursula
I bought a palette from ulta since there was a sale. So excited to use it!!!
OMG- I HAVE THE SAME SPONGES THAT JAMES HASSSS! but I brought them way before him though
Little does he know ppl get points for giving 5 stars
I got the brushed I loved them
I love the lip color on you!
James and Benoftheweek should colab like they should do something together
When rolling ray popped up I died 😂😂😂😂
Hi James 🙋🏽. I think that the makeup was okay. But you're beautiful ❤️ you can wear anything and STILL look fabulous 🤩❤️.
Try full face of Walmart makeup
The only makeup product I really like from them is their eyeliner 10x better and cheaper than huda beauty + other top brands … their lip stains are okay… matte lip creams nah … hyaluronic acid is a yes/better than okay … and you look stunning by the way!
Jesus Christ is Lord
🙂😀😃….. Not that bad.
i loooooove the zoom at 9:18! do it more often baby <3
I always brush through my eyelashes after I curl them I feel like it separates them before I put on mascara and makes it apply nicer, so I can see why they invented that eyelash curler
i actually hated this look untilllllll u put on the lipstick and gloss. tbh.
the lashes fixed it  ,the eye shadow was well fine the blue was bad
a dark blue lip would look better
The reason I watch James Charles is because of the background music
Me buying clothes from shein…….
now you should definitely do a video on a full week of outfits from shein!!
Video idea - go to different makeup stores blindfolded pic some products and do a full face of makeup
Imagine having a creditcard
Full face Milani?
James: Doesn't like the makeup look Me: Can't even get my eye liner wings to match-
Hi  sis i love u soooo much girl u ar the best iam in love with ur videos and u م go♥️♥️🏳️‍🌈
James sponsoring ikea for free lol
NOT THE "RIGHT IN FRONT OF MY SALAD"💀💀💀
james can u make a holiday into like you did last year?!!!!!!
Is anyone gonna talk abt his EYES?! THEYRE RED?!?!
Honestly the products aren’t that bad as you reacted on them , idk I just felt that you hated everything but the truth is that these products are perfect for normal people who can’t buy from an expensive brands
But always end up looking great✨❤️
We believe in you ❤️❤️❤️
praying for you're skin
the look is a little overloaded but it okay
The conceiler combo was not it but even after that you still look cute because you have amazing skills. On anyone who isnt a pro....tragedy would happen
Watever you do with your makeup names   What ever you do with your makeup it always looks amazing stunning magnisafint
It looks like the eye makeup is hurting your eyes James!! They are SO red. 👁 👀
Shopmissa next?
The whole look don't look bad on camera tho
Yay! James in Trending again! Love that he’s back! And so relaxing watching his videos on the weekend!
SheIn is fast fashion. Im not mad at them for copying stuff because all of them do and we arent all able to afford those original creations
Shein has very good products... like the megafamous eyeliner! I was waiting for that👐 But it's true that u have to know very well Shein to find this jewels😊😊😊💜💜💜
could you do a makeup video showing the texture of your skin? I would love to see you embrace textured skin. It would make me feel so much more secure.
It looks amazing sister
James you should play Roblox games that are about you for a YouTube video
whoever edits this is amazing
I’m asking.. can I have $10,000? 🥴
I haven't tried any Shein makeup products, but I don't really want to after seeing this look.
for some reason ur intro makes me want to listen to Christmas pentatonix
Don't do the closeups man. It blows my heart and mind away!♥️🥺
2:46 : goes to SHEIN to take the birthday skin primer out of my cart  Cuz wthhhh 🤣🤣🤣
It looks sooooo amazing 🤩
Do dollar store
WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU GIVE MONEY TO SHEIN VOLUNTARILY
not me having the gloss in my shein cart 😭😭😭
WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU GIVE MONEY TO SHEIN VOLUNTARILY
Your a man, act like one
The look isn’t as bad as james is saying it actually looks similar to his og makeup style
hi
a
I love ur outfit OH MY GAWDDD
The strongest people make time to help others,Even They are Struggling with Their  Own Problems, Your One Click can make me happy 😇 GodBlessYou🤲🙂xa
FULL FACE MAC NEXT!!!!
No matter what challenge James does he ends up looking stunning- HOW
You are beautiful all the time!🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃❤️❤️
😍🥰👏🏻
I feel like from far away this look would look great (with a different outfit <3), but up close, sis, just buy quality makeup if you're gonna buy any at all (especially when there's a chance you can get cancer).
Do another one
Pls try indian brand make up products ♥️💄💄💄💄💄
For the price, the makeup did its job.
I wish James made a video similar to "SPILL YOUR GUTS" show where he would answer most juicy questions from subscribers. I think that could be entertaining😄 Who agrees??
What about the mascara and lashes lol
Never tried makeup from SHEIN & not going to😂
is that makeup fire proof
15:45 😂yes they did, it’s the first thing I saw
You should do ASMR makeup look
I don’t like ur channel but I dislike how long it took-
I got the same warning on a cookie kit 😬
the puff looks kinda cool tbh
It can’t just be me who thinks that James in the intro where he is animated he looks just like his brother Ian
You may not like the makeup but your making it look good because you know how to do makeup lol love your videos ✨💜💓💙
you can send me your TikToks. I’ll watch them lol
I love you jamesssss
It would look better with a different shirt
The makeup looks rlly good but the eye shadow is giving peacock. The lipstick is good but I still want a bad one. Please do a video having a person who barely knows what makeup is to do a full face of makeup with NO HELP! love u sister 🙏🔥💖👀🌴✨☁🧡
I think it looks nice but i‘d be better if the eyeshadow colour would be matching with your nails ;)
Love you sister♥️ keep up the good work
Honestly, james can make any makeup look good because its in how you apply it and you're so talented in what you do. Even if you dont like the look itself, the process is always fun to watch and the commentary from your friends is HILARIOUS! Love watching your videos as always. Stay blessed sister! ❤🔥💯
James puts on a ton of blush  Also James:Its not giving
It does really look pretty in the sun
You should try Essence glam🙃
considering the makeup is from shein, we already know the quality is going to be low. so i think with that in mind, this look turned out beautifully! 💗
Love it
Lol 😆 your getting drag just like you said, I 100% agree with you tho 👀
unapologetic pr*dator, you will pay for your actions in hell
I KNEW DIS VIDEO WAS GONA HAPPEN
The only logical answer I have for "salad" is that ice/iceberg got lost in translation and turned iceberg into iceberg lettuce which equals salad.
If something sucks then you will make it work James Charles I love your videos so much you deserve all the subscribers and likes you get
How about full face from amazon
If salad was a fair light color... What was the coconut one???
Do a dollar tree make up look!!
Early bish😉
Do a shopmissa makeup review next
Can you do a fordeal makeup please
I thought maybe “salad” was a color corrector 😂 nope
eeh it looks decent but i dont like the fact that there is a pink lip with red nails blue and gold eye with the shirt
Can you buy from shein Clothes?
“Right in front of my salad”😂
Can u pls do crazy artistic eye looks with ur pallet
get off the platform!
Hey James u should test essence and make a full face video please
Lord!!! Can we talk about james outfit here 😍
It’s really not as bad as I thought shein makeup would be!!!!
I actually love the look on you but usually I would use morphe palettes and revolution products
Next video “FULL FACE OF SHOP MISS A PRODUCTS”
yall forgettng shein abuses their workers?
James you can literally make any makeup look, look good! I have to agree that the colors don’t really match with your outfit though.
Make a video on indian makeup brands Kaybeauty, Manish Malhotra, Renee, lakme etc
Honestly James could be given a news paper and make it into a look
do a makeup review on beauty bay!!!!!!!!!!
Sister slaying as always!
"My crease is cut with my salad concealer"
James you need to try makeup by FRAN its a brasilian brand
Please make a make up video only using beauty blenders and not brushes 😘
Honestly makeup look is really good
you should do edible makeup! example: peanut butter for foundation Nutella for contour ext
hi James Charles I love you video so much I watch all of them
It's already past Halloween and here is james bringing back flashback mary
Idk how to do any makeup at all I just watch so many make up vids
Has James done a dollar tree one!! If he hasnt he totally should!
I’m not mad at SHEIN when it comes to clothes. I bought a lot of shirts that I won’t find somewhere else
This girl reminds me of this boy down the street I grew up with.
Booooo boooo booooo boooo boooo boooo
Try using the foundation in your normal makeup routine and see how you like it. At some point it was getting a lot of hype.
Hate on James all you want he is actually SUPER talented and intelligent. PERIOD!!!🥰💕
You actually killed it james
gays life expectancy is 20 years less than heteros for known reasons
it's ok
I think you can make the worst makeup in the world look the best!!!
FYI dune was a waist of 2 hours lmaoooo when is the next one coming bcuz that was just a prep for part 2
It looked good I just say maybe do like a eye liner wing with a new shirt because it does not really match the shirt but otherwise, I love it!
Hey James what's your favorite setting powder. I either look too yellow or too white
it’s giving 60s & 70s look 😭😭
i can't take you seriously saying "using my salad concealer" HAHAHAHA
“my crease is cut with my salad concealer” LMAO
Me thinking James was drunk while filming when I actually had the video speed on 0.75x for half the video and didn’t realize 💀
I love you, I hope you see my comment😩🖤
It's not that good
before i watched i said "low quality...low prices ..... AND SKIN DISEASES!!" now my head is bangin
I think it looks good
I loved this video James! You did an amazing job!
It is good but not the best make up you did❤️❤️
Do Full face using sugar cosmetics please
I think it looks great!❤️
More than James makeup i love his personality and him  "It's clear that he is the best makeup artist"  Lub u James ❤️ Wait did James Charles proposed  the famous and accurate "Charles law" ?  hehe just kidding lol
Love the new intro!
.O. me hab Milani:D
7/10
Don’t even need to put the video on 2x.
James I thought it looked pretty good! I love you and I hope you have an amazing day!! 🧡😘
why was the lipstick kinda giving though
Love shein
Love u sister😊😊
It was fine u just have high expectations
oh my god his skin is so nice and beautiful crying
6:11 daddy chill
Hello can you please do a video reacting to all I am James Charles cousin videos like other celebrities cousins
Glitter💜💎💜✨
Where did you get that shirt?! That is SUPER cute!! 💜
honestly the products didnt perform that bad LOOOL like ive had loreal and maybelline products perform much worse.
On camera looks very good but in real i'm not sure 😁
WTF
Ehhhhh its ok
Honestly it’s just the blush but other than that I like it 💙
Will you be on instant influencer s2
Because he did it any makeup really looks awesome ngl 😃
LITERALLY no matter what products you use, or how cheap it's or how bad it's James, it's gonna look good on you, purr.... ❤️
It honestly looks good
In the next video can you do Sephora makeup  only?
It looks fine but I’m not wearing it so it might feel horrible so people should not just attack you and get mad at you for saying you hate it because they’re not putting make up on
Do douglas😂
Jamie baby if THIS is bad, then what is mine? 🤡🤡
SOOOO many air quotes.
i have my 567th pinkity drinkity!!!!
10:56 .........           and i started seeing kris jenner in james
It’s okay but I’m sure you could do much better but you did great with those products
Okay, but his shirt is so cute!
I love shein for the fact they are affordable and have soo many options for everything!!
james babyGOORRLL that turtle neck ain't it...
I have some products from sheglam and I absolutely LOVE them, the powder literally blurred all of my pores, and it feels really comfortable on the skin, I got a matte blush from them and it's absolutely STUNNING, and I have a couple lip products from them including a matte lipstick, a lip oil and a lip crayon , and they're all amazing .
JAMES IM OBSESSED WITH THIS MAKEUP LOOK ONE OF THE BEST EVAAAA LOVE THE LIPSTICK 💄 XX
IM YOUR #1 FAN!
Please do a video doing a full face of makeup with essence makeup
skin tone vibes ? 🤡🤡
I have that eyelash curler 😅
Such an amazing video !!! You should also try doing a full face of ali express makeup ! it’s kind of like wish but relatively cheaper. I’m a huge fan ♡
I don't buy from Shein because of their tendency to exploit their workers, but I can see what you mean by the makeup not working too well together. If I'm being honest, it could be the formulas that they're trying to copy from other brands just not mixing well, and because it's cheaper, they wouldn't really attempt to make it nicer because they want to make money, and cheapness is a way to go. But your makeup look would honestly look really good with a sky blue shirt and a pair of gold asymmetric earrings i think ✌️
try shein clothes
You picked the worst products, next time shop better to tailor to your interests. They have plenty of matte blush shades for example, and colored eyeshadows are always the hardest formulas for makeup brands. Their neutral eyeshadows are pigmented and blend well
Charles you are my idol the way you never give up I amazballs👍🏻❤️🥲
its good but the eyeshadow colors is bad
I love your look you are so beautiful
“OUR GOLD SHIMMER PUFF!!!!!”  Imdead😂🤣😂😂😂🤣
I am a sister
I Love your videos
James always makes his makeup look amazing, no matter what he's working with! You've outdone yourself again, sister James ❤️❤️❤️
The fast talking is back🤡
I think it looks absolutely gorgeous! I wish I could do my makeup HALF as good as James
you should do this with make up from shopmissUSA
it’s been a long time since I’ve watched James, I miss his “Hi Sisters!” so much. <3
james makeup is good like omg omg omg omg  omg  omg omg omg omg omg omg omg omg omg omg omg omg omg omg omg omg omg omg omg omg omg omg omg omg omg omg omg omg so gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo so fine and good james
Can you do a full face makeup using only foundation (using different shades ofc) not only foundation it's mostly about  doing full face makeup using only 1 type of product  Only if it's safe though.. P.s. love your videos 😍😍 (I really don't know if anyone else already did this)
I really like it i just wish the blue was a lot better and more pigmented
James just makes EVRYTHING great!!!!🧡💙
I swear by sheglam skinny brow pencils. In fact I buy 4 at a time. I love the eye shadow pallets and own a few. Also, the cream blushes are fantastic. For me... I cannot justify the price of high end make up and if you know what your looking for shein has some really great dupes.
Please try makeup from Amazon too James 😩. BTW ly ❤
The makeup looked beautiful James is able to pull off anything♡ ps sorry of the spelling is bad or dosen't make sense I'm literally 12 years old
we need full face of sugar brand makeup who wants it pls like
When I saw the title I was like “oh god his eyes are red what did they do to him 🤭” .The makeup looks great but I just noticed that…
Do a full face with fruits and all of th things will be fruits. Tip: pomegranate as lipstick
Bestie, you looked amazing, considering it was from SHEIN.
I think it looks too shiny
😍💝🥰😍😍😍
He should try romwe makeup!!!💋💄
Sister I guess you forgot to put on the setting spray 🤔🙃
Ngl this looks does look really good, James I just think your able to pull off any makeup look with any makeup products tbh besides whenever you do makeup views or videos like these I want your opinion on them first before I go and use them. I think for another video idea you could probably do like trying on outfits from shein😍😊❤️💕
“my crease is cut… with my sALAD CONCEALER 🥗” IM DEAD-
U should try item beauty by Addison rae
I love the eyeshadow colour lmao xx
Anything from anywhere you make it beautiful
do a full face MAC makeup look as well pleaseee
DO A E BOY LOOK
🇧🇬❤️
It looks good vivent the fact it’s SHEIN but it’s not somit I would use I like full coverage not buildable coverage x
When will the 2nd season of Instant Influencer be released?
ok i loved the nails at the end the clicking ooooooooooooooooooofff
Everytime James says the products suck... He looks amazing 😭❤️
hi james try korean make up
I LOVE IT you look so good and you are my idol
Sometimes all those are reviews are people just getting point to get money
7:59 It did not give what it was suppose to give..
8:04 HELPPP ROLLING RAY
😬SHEIN sucks I don’t recommend you using there makeup
Shein  is just Fine
You look super cute in that look you did really good 🤩🤩🥳
The makeup looks fine, it's just the blush that didn't blend well but have a good day 💋
U look Beautiful and u are good at make up 💜💚🧡
The makeup looks good but doesn't match with your outfit .
Can you just have a full face of make up just from your pallet
Well I definitely learbed something today...always thought it was pronounced SHINE not SHE-IN 😂😂😂
Your makeup doesn’t even look bad lol
The makeup is really really hot I don't really care how you look but it looked really good on you it really fits you don't just just do what you think's best for you and have a good life
Umm I really think it looks fine 🤷🏻‍♀️
We love a shein sister🥳
Girl ... I'm poor this looks fine I don't expect it to be mac or fenty or Bobby brown like ... what are you comparing it to ? It was honestly fine ... maybe wet the brush to pick up shadows  but if anything it's fine
Can u do a Indian make-up look pls
Do a makeup look with only target product's
James, your top is insane!!! Love it!!! The makeup was great!!!
Hi sister u need to try these wine lip tints they are popular on tic tok
It was great u did could no matter what and I live your nails they are so cute 🥰
man I haven't heard that cheer in so long that brought me back to the days of the original All That show on Nick
It’s a little much they did not like eachotger
what did we expect,it wasnt that expensive but the items were from "SHEIN" it could have been better "btw im from the Philipines!"
Do amazon next
Is it just me or James always finds ways to make the worst make up to the best face of makeup 💄
James you should’ve tested the viral shein makeup products that everyone talks about on tiktok!
Honestly dreams can make any make up products look pretty good but I would read it a 5 out of 10 for the shimmery stuff and the foundation but the eyeshadow I would rate 7.5 out of 10.  I love your video’s They are so entertaining and fun
I don’t like how u like bullied mackenzie ziegler doing ur makeup bc she's bad at doing it and u only respected her sister maddie ziegler bc she's good at makup
I was doing my painting than I got notification for ur video   Then I complete my painting and watch this I have nothing to say />  U look hella fine😍😉😉
too oily ngl
Didn't expect to be early?
the only thing im concerned for you is that...is ur face okay after the primer?? I'm really worried for u ngl >.<💖✨
James can literally pull any look with cheap products
despues los españoles hablamos rapido en fin hahah
I love you James Charles you’ve inspired me to push myself and I’m so grateful to watch your content I love you
I have question that what is your gender 🤔
Shein is worst✌🏻 gud that its banned in india they literally just copy everything
Your makeup is stunning Sister 🥰
not that bad🙃 just sand them to me if your not gonna use them😂😍 ❤u sis ❤
It actually does look pretty but that’s probably just because James is a professional and wiggled it around and made it serve
The lashes are bad but the rest beautiful
James Charles be a boy not a girl are you a girl maybe I think you’re a boy so then be a boy
I think it looks pretty! I love the gold eyeshadow and the lipstick! You should do a blue and purple eye look with a hot pink lipstick.
Loved watching this. BTW: Can you share a video, of all the BLOOPERS (out-takes)?
I actually really love it! Or it's just pretty james
omg next you should do longest wig or dress in the world!
I love your earrings! Need those! Help me!
I need that shirt
You need to do The singing my makeup  routine those were my favorite !!!!!!! pleaseeeeeeeeeee repost everyone if you agreeeee
I like it but you’re
How about Liza Koshy's One of One??
Hi James, I love your videos
*tbh i think it looked pretty good and it’s a great option for people on a budget*
I think everything was good except the highlighter and that little golden glow ball thing
Not really related to this particular video! But I’ve been saying this for a while: “You should collab with Brad Mondo!” 🥰
The editor 🖤
can james please do a full face of makeup using face paint pleaseee😏
like it
Hey ☺️ can u do a video with Lele pons
That actually looks okay!😅 Definitely not the best, but at least it looks fresh and not too dry :D
Omg I feel you about your friends not looking at the tiktoks you send them 😫
I wanna try the salad.
i like this video it was good
😍
Oh no no no, honey..  it was the salad and lip gloss for me.. I laughed so hard. 😂
It looks gorgeous so stop saying that please they make up is perfectly fine and it’s beautiful!!!!
Oyes
it is fineeeeeeeeeeeeee   lol
I like it so much
james educate yourself about SHEIN.
Im glad you did this review, I was planning to get rid of my entire makeup set and buy a new one from shein. Now I know what to expect. Really appreciate it❤🙏😘
🧡
I like it
James you have 24.5 subscribers to your channel; you are reviewing Shein and you do not mention neither once the how unsustainable their products are... this is very disappointing
Love you sis! ❤️
It’s giving ankah 🧍‍♀️
Loved this video!!!
Do a depop review 😂
James I love your videos but boy you talk so bloody fast 🙈🤣❤
Me can't stop smiling I love again so much
Am I the only one who misses the old intro!?🥲
James should really do a skin care routine video🥺❤️
Honestly I like the eyeshadow makeup and the products from shein arend so bad
Your Skin Look Flawless💕✨
Arabic translation
I've never heard of Shein and can see that I haven't missed out in anything.
James we need  you to test the 5 minutes craft video again!!!.
Your career went literally FLOPPPP 😂 careful what you wish for babes
Ngl the thumbnail looks like hes gonna cry. Geez the makeup was that bad ?😂
I like the look
i feel like james can make anything look good haha
How about you try some SHEIN outfits next James?!
It’s not that all other 49 states are fine James.. the state of California has to put that due to certain laws that are in place lol you’re hilarious love you
you can leave reviews for points that save money thats why there are soooo many ily
FULL FACE OF AMAZON MAKEUP!!!
LOL does James not know that most products in the US have that warning on them? Lmaooo
The fact his nails are very small compared to the other ones 😦 -
Can we talk about how the brush applied the foundation with a full coverage effect !!
Full face of Amazon makeup!
stan a salad concealer
in england shein is like gucci. we love it
You should look for James apparel designs from Shein
it was actually not that bad for shein plus it was cheap for a full face
Shein makeup actually isn't that bad well the makeup I have tried from there atleast. I think your team did you dirty lol 😆
I love it
Prop-65 is very misleading
Hey Sisters 💕 Sister James is it possible to change the backdrop colour because I feel like white is too blinding for my eyes 😭🥺 thank you in advance 💕
James is an artist .. just fact.
No ads? Where is he getting money from now?
I just like the foundation  and the eyeshadow pallete 😬
I love you James, but today's look was hurting my eyes 🙈
I'm not sure to feel about this because i'm not a FAN of SHEIN but I don't hate it. There is odd things on there...👀
I like the lipstick… that’s about it 😂
Wow! at the ending,  it was the fastest you talked in a while. its hypnotic hahaha
It is better than I thought
as a person who used to buy from shein 24/7 when I first saw this video you know I had to click. And to be honest it doesn’t look as bad as I thought it was going to be
We need a outfits from shien plz James 😔💞
I love James Charles makeup choice. But what in the name of Davey Jones locker is a sal-lad?
Oh that shirt is so cute. Look how the light purple blend with rosy pink.
Please review shein outfits next!
Nice look🍪
Sisteeerrr where is the turtleneck from? From the second i ve seen the post with it and the jacquemus purse on the 1st of October i was so obssesed, but i couldn’t figure out where is it from. You look absolutly stunning in it and btw the make-up is just GORGEOUS. AND THE VIDEO AT THE ENT IN THE SUN IS JUST 😍😍😍😍😭🍭
I'm so glad James finally did this video.😆😜
Hi I love your channel this is one of my favorite videos

Beautiful makeup James!
James: *i'm very responsible with my money* Also James:
Salad should have been called Salad Cream 😂😂😂😂
Shien also do child labour..... :/
Eye shadow didn't match 1st of all. It's overall OK. But not very satisfying. Keep it up James.🥰
Does James know that shein give you points if you review and most of the people that review is just because they want that points to have More coupons
Shein literally uses child labour
James why do you insist on saying “like” before and after every single word you say :/
Could u do a video in which u do ur daily makeup using ur usual products pls
Anyone will agree with me:- that top is so doja cat😩😩💜❤️🧡💚💙
As all the europeans can agree, WE ABSOLUTELY NEED A ESSENCE FULL FACE OF MAKEUP VIDEO!!!!! LIKE ITS NOT A WANT ITS A NEED!!!!!!!!
What did he say? Lol
I love you! You make my days better.
Please make a video trying on 1$ makeup from miss a 😌
Tbh the "salad" really did not do it 😂😂 and the blush.. Oh lord😂 I think you saved it a little bit at the end with the eye shadow but this is honestly just not looking great lol I literally have that same lip gloss with the gold shine and it's just really sticky and shitty after you wear it for some time
What is you review on DUNE James?💀💀💀💀🤣
Full face of ASOS makeup (I love ASOS)
Can you please do a video with your fans sending you makeup products???

James! Hey! Love from India! Why don't you review skincare products for your next video! Love your videos! <3
Fab-u-lous however the skin tone does not match u sister
James for how fast you speak I need some subtitles! I’d love to see them if you put them on again 💝
You are so cute
PETITION FOR FULL FACE INDIAN MAKEUP.
For me the lipstick is very cute but the eye thingy doest blend in the outfit
Hey sister.......u look kinda drunk with that look! But it's okay......I still love u the same!😉💜
It’s pronounced shine ✨ ,  German spelling
You should do full face of makeup using 5 minute craft hacks
A thousand times better than wish tho
The Lips seem good James ....i really liked it ..it suits you ❤️✨
im really surprised about the quality of those cause i thought they'd be worse! however i actually have an eyeliner from shein and it's the best ive ever tried, its really pigmented and it stays on the whole day💅🏼 i really enjoyed this video and im really excited to see what you do next!! love ya james<3
I think except for blush everything looks really good!
Please do one next from “Shop miss A” I would love to see that
I really liked the final look in the sun Like wow!
Love your nails James
I’ve got to say the eyes don’t look great
Can you please do a video on transforming into Ariana Grande or Olivia Rodrigo pleaseee ❤️❤️💕💕
احبك ❤
Try doing this wearing makeup from a country
I wish I had that makeup      In my face...
I love your tiktok videos
It's looking really good sister but its the salads for me
It’s alright it’s not what James would expect due to the ones he wears but it looks alright James it really does!
Thumbs up 👍🏻
😳😳
Pretty!😍😘😻
Eye shadows really a disaster up there 😂
JAMES PLS DO MORE BAKING VIDEOS!
Still can’t believe you have followers. I used to love u and ur videos…such a shame what u did
When James said 'Thank God m not reproducing 'that got me
Okay but the eyelashes from shein you guys are absolutely amazing and so cheap I have 100’s of eyelashes now. I’ve probably only ordered one set that I didn’t particularly like but they all came as expected other than that
Hello I'm a new fan from Philippines! Omg I love your videos. 💖
SHEIN don't need no paid marketing...
James, James, James, You have SAVED MY LIFE, U R THE COOLEST YOUTUBER AND BEAUTIFULLLLLLLL 💞💞💞💞🥺🥺🤧🤧💅🏻💅🏻💅🏻
Such a good video!!You are so much fun!!
That “warning” is literally on everything I’ve bought headboard, organizers etc.) from wayfair and Walmart with that warning, if and item that has a chemical on the list of this proposition and it’s sold or available to be sold to California people legally they have to put that warning on it. It is called proposition 65 . Which has to do with California’s water supply being contaminated with chemicals a long time ago. Its a warning that really doesn’t matter, you don’t need to worry about it.
Louis is my fav- also I love the banter between u and ur friends
very fun video and i really love your nails
James can we see you do a Korean makeup or trying out Korean makeup product. ❤️
THE LIPSTICK IS STUNNING IDK WHAT U R TALKING ABT JAMES !!!
He should’ve bought the famous liquid blush, seems to be really popular and good
the make up was little bit bad but fine i like it
I love it com on
do alll dark makeup dark foundation dark lipstick dark contour it will be so funny
It's ok but bad
He is so Kind!
OMG my package from shein is coming IM ADDICTED TO SHEIN 🥲🥲🥲❤️
Hiii James I just got my first ever James Charles pallete and its absolutely adorable and beautiful I really loved it looking forward to get your cafe collection😍☕🍻🌈🎆
I agree that it doesn't match the outfit but I loveeee the eye shadow and the lips... they look stunning 🤩
James can we have a vid with your brother
Looking nice
Please please do Indian makeup challenge
Please do Indian makeup challenge
I appreciate you doing this video. You’re insight is very real. The products just don’t work together. But hey I guess if someone is on a real budget they might try. Although I would just stick to elf or something
it was i little to much shine
lmao its my bday tday
The makeup is perfect. And the blush looks cute as hell . Love you dress
James can make any worst makeup brands look beautiful ❤️
I would be thankful if anyone can suggest, brown skinned make-up artist
The turtle neck 😭😭😭❤❤❤❤
You should do a video with a full face of only cream and liquid products
The makeup musk look bad off camera and good on camera because it looks so good to me😭
Wtf is he wearing-
I actually think it looks really nice :) but I can understand why you don’t like it considering you’re used to using better quality products
I have been watching you since I was in 9 th grade  I enjoy watching your videos so much  I messaged you on your phone no. Which was in the description but I never got any reply 😔😔, but it's ok  I love you so much James 🥰🥰🥰 Hope you are happy and healthy ❤️❤️❤️🥰 Lots of love from india 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳❤️
I love it but not with that top
I’m so obsessed with James theme song 🎧
pls talk about dune
Could you do full face of essence makeup. Its a cheap but mostly good drugstore brand, you have once tried their highlighter and you liked it💕
Whatever it is u look absolutely stunning. It doesn't matter what the product it is, u just pull up everything so beautifully ❤. Lots of love 💕 .
No matter where the products are from, you pull the look off.
We all know where the “right in front of my salad” came from, right? 🥴
removing makeup asmr pls
Setting spray my fav part can't believe u forgot it 😭😭😥😥😢😢🥺🥺🥺
My crease is cut with my Salad concealer.... LOL James is so funny
I think that the makeup wasn’t overly bad it was obviously different but I think it was worth a shot and it wasn’t too bad!
What’s not to like about it even out in the sun it looks great
its cheap but, bad qualtiy!
He said fuck it we gotta open it 😂😂😂😂
OMG if James hasn’t already, he should do a full face Mac makeup look.
So beautiful stop saying it's bad 😘🥰❤💓
Ahh I need to see a review on ipsy makeup 😳🔥🔥
U really need to try k-beauty James
james still looks good
Do a shein rating clothing haul!
Ur makeup looks beauty sisterrrrrrr!!❤️❤️❤️
James literally is so talented
Do a review of Honest Beauty and other clean beauty makeup! :)
Do a review of Honest Beauty and other clean beauty makeup! :)
James, please try Beauty Glazed Eyeshadow pallette ❤️❤️❤️
IVE LITERALLY BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
No matter what challenge James does he ends up looking stunning- HOW
Honestly, I’d have been WAY more worried about wish makeup than SHEIN makeup 😅😅😅if you survived that I’m sure you’ll be fine 🥺
can you do emily from tim burton’s corpse bride?
James pls done a full face with korean makeup and love you
I had a SHIEN cheeseburger
the amount of times he did the hand quotations is kinda scary
James, stop... this looks so good. Are you kidding?? In my opinion shein makeup reminds me of certain drug store makeup and this reminds me... you should do a full face of drug store makeup, if you haven't done one yet.
It's pretty bad to be honest It's just disappointing because you spend a lot of money and still got a result like this
Salad! Salad!
i like shein so i can look boujee but for cheap! read the reviews first tho bc thats a MUST
Video idea: using makeup from the dollar tree
I wish I was good at make up
i love shein.
I'm such a big fan but I can't get any merch or your pallet :( but I hope thats ok
I'd love to see a Nimya review
Wow
Damnnn besteh this actually looked good..didn’t expect that lol as i have a bad experience with shien makeup line but u absolutely rocked everything dude  Loads of love from korea❤️

It’s looks fine James it actally looks pretty ✌️
he can do make up with anything and end up looking gorgeous
Can I get a heart sister please it's my sister's birthday
James should do a K-beauty challenge!!
Tbh i like the final look 👀
It is not as good as your other makeup looks
James :chein Me: SHARON
i dont like the top with it but it looks good
I will say that I bought a red lipstick from Shein and it’s MY FAVORITE. I haven’t tried much makeup products but I definitely love shopping there.
ngl James but it doesn't look that bad cause u can  pull off any makeup look sister but I dont really like it cause of the color eyeshadow you used the blues where ok but when you added the yellow it just killed the whole makeup look. But you slayed it sister love ya
wow this is so beautiful!! ur lit gorge
7:25 I LTERALLY BOUGHT IT TOO!! IT WAS AWFUL ABSOLUTELY NO PIGMENT IN THAT CONTOUR-
Dune was indeed slow, yo can say it 😩
That brush set is giving SIGMA !!  I’m not feeling the look tho. I agree with u , makeup from sites like that scare me 😭. It’s too much good drugstore makeup u can get right away for all that.
The foundation is great. I use it as my everyday foundation.
you should try second hand stores/ thrift store makeup
Y'all please don't buy from Shein! They use slave and child labour to make their products, plus they underpay them. Their working conditions are also dangerous, and are really bad for the environment! Sure they have cheap and cute clothes, but its really not worth it for low-quality clothing that also puts their workers in danger. Btw no hate towards James
It's GOOD!
In my personal opinion it doesn’t look like James it’s kinda off but it isn’t James fault it’s the makeup he used today it looked kinda off for James to me personally but if we like see from like more far away it would look good
I mean don't know anything about makeup but James you look stunning! All your makeup looks amazing and once again you have pulled off another amazing look.
*Whoever reading this. Don't give up. Hustle everyday.*
Not James not realizing there’s 51 states instead of 50😂
The blush and the eyeshadow is just NOT IT LMAOO-
it looks very good and probably very easy look for like beginners but if you see what you do with your and better pallets and better products it’s not as good but it looks very good onto you
James omg your hydro dip outfit looks stunning 😍 omg Sister luv you happy 24 Million Subscribers 💖 Omg Sister James You Make-up looks Good I mean it's too glittery it's on spot it's alright we can't expect much in shein
I was waiting for this!!
The thumbnail lol !!! James u r so funny
Me: Enters the vid and watches it. Also me: I WANT THAT TOP!
I really loved the eye makeup..like without looking with the top...it's beautiful ❤
Love Shein on their affordable clothing pieces.  I’ve not tried makeup from them.
The way he uses his hands to talk
Become a barb
I have been watching him for 3 years and he still is awesome
I got that same warning on a pair of pants I ordered from fashionnova which is super strange, it was on the tag when they arrived in the mail which pissed me off because I wish I had known before purchasing them I wouldn’t have bought them!!
makeup - uhm okay next challenge - make a makeup frm. all dark shades then but them. from the dollar tree and then get some snacks from the dollar tree a d vlog it all pls
Love u jamess
Reminds me of when Ross mistakenly wore a top Rachel bought for herself😁
do another unedited video!!
How should I come out to my family about being bi and gender fluid?
Hi hi
You should watch and react to makeup tutorials (bad ones)
James you should try buying clothings and accessories from shein it would be fun
u look soooo greattt i lov the palettes
Ah love the outfit 💗
I have some make up pallets from Shein and it's very pigmented and good actually (it was the 2nd pallet that James used)
not the rainbow card 💀
You should do a full face of makeup by petite and pretty! please, please!!!
I like it....obviously not your best...But it looks pretty good James...🥰🥰🥰love u lots...😘😘u're amazing...😊
the fact he acts like he did nothing is kinda sad and how he’s still majorly supported
My friend send me tiktoks and OMG there's a lot I still watch them and reply back but sometimes it gets tiring but they're my friends so I do as they say or watch
its not a bad look its a 8/10 for me 🙂
I forgot about u bro, dont rape people anymore fr ong
I love your shirt
If you struggled with it we would definitely look a hot mess using it. Of curse you made it work but I doubt I could.
U look like a 🤡
James, when are you going to tell us about your boyfriend?
finally someone that’s says shein RIGHT !
I love the way you introduce yourself so cheerfully James ❣️❣️
I hate to bring negativity but as a fan, it’s so crazy to see the difference in views and support. Love you James 💕
SALAD?!!
It doesn't look good tbh. There is better things but this is could be good for beginners of the want too risk it that is.
Do a marvel makeup look
English subtitles?
Another idea for a video…fly me out; do my makeup😁
I would love to see a review of Believe Beauty!
VIDEO IDEA!!! Work w/ Mimi Choi, she’s amazing!!! Just reach out PLEASE
This makeup is alright, I think it just wasn’t my favorite😐…will say though that that has to do w/ the fact that I don’t think it goes w/ the outfit so much
Can you do a full face make up look with eBay products
"I just did a crease cut with my salad concealer..." literally 💀
HI JAMESSSS I LOVED THIS VIDEO, can you do TRYING CLOTHING FROM SHEIN PLEASE 💕💕🥰🥰🥰🥰
You make fast fashion look good. I love your look even though I do not like shein.  You always look fabulous!
Its good makeup for us people who cannot afford expensive makeup!!
So beautiful ✨❤
Hii sister James! Would reallyyy love to see you use make up products from different countries, like have a playlist based on that concept. Where you pick a country and use all make up products from their country, be it drugstore or brands from there. Pleaseee add India to the list! I know sooooo many of us watch your videos and would loveee to see you! Hope you see this!❤️❤️ Loveyouu
I think it looked good, James. For the price it turned out pretty nice. 😊
It really doesn’t look bad either that or you just have great skin !!!!!😛🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
I don’t want to say to much bc I really would not know with my moms old dollar pallet, but I think it looks way better than I could ever do and with a blue and glue outfit I think you could work it!💕💗
I thought it looked beautiful. Don’t like all the gold you added to your face. But honestly wouldn’t ever buy make up from them or anything else for that matter lol
Its all 5 star ratings because shein censors all the other star ratings snd deletes them. Many youtubers have covered this topic.
for shein products they are pretty good. I feel like you just make it work! ilysm🥰
do another cooking video!!
Oh never mind
I LOVE SHEIN!!! They are a great company!! Most of the reviews are legit because people will post pictures with their reviews.
Hi James! I Love your videos❤ You are so good at makeup I hope I can be as good as you one day😁
I think it's kind of cute
The makeup is not that bad
Uhhh...no James that eyeshadow. That's all I'm going to say. Always love your makeup looks but just not this one.
I loved the New intro!!!!!
James
It looks good in the camera 📷 soooooo IDK

ALIEXPRESSS PLEASEE
You look beautiful in anything and any makeup 😊😊💜💜👍👍
Do fashion nova makeup
This made me order 15.00 dollars worth of SHEIN jewelry so excited
I think for a beginner this makeup can really work but for people who are into makeup already we definitely like different products . Although I love SHEIN’s lashes .
Loved this challenge. Your a good sport👍🏼
Anyone else memorized James intro song haha. Ik I did
Pretty cool but you look like always
YASSSS LOVE THIS.
Why are most of the memes black people? Are u trying to tell us something James?
James look up Prop 65 - California. That is why the brand has to put that disclaimer.
Its….okay and not that bad
I feel Like whatever James puts on I His face looks amazing like omg he never looks bad!❤️😊
James looks really good.
When I lived in Florida there was a bag of chips that had the same warning
James, you look amazing! I know you are used to the high end quality but this looks just as great on you. 😊❤️
You should try a full face of Amazon dupes, I think that would be great.
James why dont you try a makeup product from Malaysia? Such as alha alfa myb
Hey fuckers not sisters
It looks so good
I’ve been waiting for this video
I love it!
Please try doing a full face using shop Miss A
Video sharing skin routine!!
Omg it looks good
I've seen people saying good things about shein liquid blush , wish james tried it out !
Hey the eye shadow looks beautiful  sister don't degrade yourself so much
I feel like your team kinda picked the worst products cuz they have so many recent good products
james love the outcome but you should do a ful face of   florence by mills makeup hope you see this!!!💜💗
Please do a full face of dollar tree make up
The Blue Eyeshadow Palette wasn’t it. That and the concealer were both flops in my opinion.
the makeup looks good to me but i also think that it might be because you have a really good camera
james can u do a full face of florence by mills produts pls. ily
I think it looks good 😘
The reference on 6:26 killed me.
This is the full face of h&m Make-up Button 😍
IM SO EXCITED YOU DID THIS VIDEO AAAAAH
I get a lot of my makeup from SHEIN it really is so good for the price point.
JAAAAAAMES HELLOOO IM HERE
Ok 👌🏻 in the sun his color and skin looked amazing
Salad could’ve been a green color corrector..they really fumbled the bag there🙄🤚🏼
U look amazing. I think u could pull a good make up look out of a bag of coal ❤❤❤❤
In my personal opinion, it seems a bit basic for your talent level. That's why you have morphe isn't it?
It's pronounce "Shine*
Love your videos James got your pallet and brushes
"The most desirable feeling" - James Charles 2021
Wait, I kind of like the gold shimmer puff!
james, i’m so glad you did this video haha, i was just wondering if i should buy makeup on shein bc makeup is expensiveeee… thanks for answering my question 🖤
Thank you love 💕
A beautiful look!!
U should do a video where you try makeup from India
U should do a video where you try makeup from India
I think it looks amazing
literally every product i have ever bought that was all natural says that about California.
Can you do full face rare beauty 😍
I have the same makeup bag that James is using for this video

His eyes actually were a little red at the end😱

I was literally waiting for this video! Thank you for posting this!!!!! <3 I actually really like the look!
15:32 she really said Edward Cullins lmao- the look was pretty good tho!!
YOU LOOK GORGGGGG ❤️👏🏼
Well damn not everyone can afford the real brand ups to the companies who dup items for people who can’t afford the real thing
could you do an original get ready with me ?
This whole look me of my auntie in 1990.
Full face with Miss A products!!???
I love SHEIN’s makeup 🥴 their brow gel is just like Anastasia’s
Wait do you live in California???
SOMEONES NEW INTRO IS LOOKING BETTA THAN EVAAAAA GET AT IT BESTIE 😭
I just came back from school and I was so happy when you uploaded this video…………….. Me and my sister just came home and wanted to watch you before going to sleep We were so happy that you reviewed SHEIN makeup I actually tried SHEIN makeup and it was not bad 👌 I loved how your videos are so funny and cool!  My sister and I are very inspired and we both want make our on bu3aty/ skin- care line
The body suit tho
OMG your mine and my bestfriends idol we love your make up and beauty videos you make our day we love ur videos so much🥺
The formulas were kinda bad but the makeup in general was really good!!
Shien is banned in India 😭
I feel like you didn't even give it a chance, you had your mind made up about it before you even tried it.
do a full face alone use beat by debs products
RANKING MY ICONIC MAKEUP LOOKS
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE EYESHADOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Love the idea for the eyeshadow Sister but the product is just no and sorry but I would say it doesn’t go with your outfit. U will always receive love and support from this sister ❤️ whether it’s good or bad. Love u sister  ❤️
I think you made the look work, despite its failures. I liked the way it came out with the eyes. I wouldn't necessarily try it for myself,because it looks too oily. I do love how you go outside of your comfort zone. I think the powder bronzer  added depth to the cream. If that makes sense. Love you, Sister!!
I like what u wearing in this video 😌🙇🏻‍♀️
Watching the video I did notice the quality wasn’t the best but the end result ended up famous! Like if someone who doesn’t know makeup and just looked at your face I feel like they wouldn’t have notice the lifting or the not very pigment eyeshadow. I can see how your not a fan of it but James let’s be real you can literally put dirt on your skin and make anything look amazing!
On camera it looks good but in your home in real life it look bad I should have told you not to do it. I SEE YOU
eyeshadow color combo is giving very ✨marching band vibes✨
It may or may not be a sweatshop took don't know
That first product warning was pretty scary 😬
I actually love it
Makeup: Shein Fit: WISH
SALAD HAHAHAH WTF
The makeup looks good..
12:06 This is a HUGE mood!
i enjoyed this video but if you didn't know shein acually uses child labor soooooo..
I like it lol
even with cheap makeup, james STILL looks absolutely GORGEOUS!!
Honestly I think it’s fine for people who don’t wear a lot of makeup. But putting it all together is…questionable. 😂
He is a vibe ❤️
Cute
- - U
I love it just not with that shirt or outfit
Honestly you have such a good camera that we can't see what you see 😩
I don’t think the foundation looks good
How are you still going on after getting demonetised!
The outcomes good despite the products
I think it looks greatt
They shadow formula was probably not good but neither was your morphe pallet, you should be use to jt
I think that you should do a blindfolded outfit shopping video!❤️
yay he listened to the idea💜💜
You look so gorgeous I wish I could do that
I feel disrespected I asked on the last few vids and my comment wasn’t up ther e I- (I’m jp James I love you)
When I saw this YouTube channel it was six hours ago so you James Charles made it six hours ago it’s June 4, 2021
ok so even though the makeup sucked, why does James make it work..?!!
Personally with the pricing it doesnt look that bad but u pulled it off
Love those nails James!
LOOKS GREAT!
I like the way you did your makeup and the the product could be a little better it looks like your face is a little oily but it looks ok
I LOVE this makeup look it’s just the shirt makes it look strange. But I love the makeup look
Not the "right in front of my salad" reference plz💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
ترجمه ي ورع
You should definitely do full face of essence makeup
The thing is is there’s like other products that are way better on that site than the products that are used on this video
I love it
You should do full face of makeup from dollar tree
You should make a tiktok every hour of the next video
The make up is okay but its not good at all. But I like this video.
I just don’t the eyeshadow for this makeup look sorry 😬😬James still love you tho 😍😘
2 days later James hair falls off and then he’s the bald head again
please dont tell me im not the only one who knows where the { RiGhT iNfRoNt Of My SaLaD  } is from💀💨
Its beautiful which ur always beautiful sister..
“My crease is cut with my salad concealer”😂😂
I doubt the reviews are paid. If the products worked for people with that budget, I'd be impressed as well. If I can not afford the expensive brand and haven't tried it yet, I wouldn't know if there's a better option, right?
ily james
stopppp I CANTTTT my friend knows i love wearing rings so she told me about shein and i love all of their rings that they show on the website yet I've never bought them. my bestie ordered me some and then this video coincidentally pops up on my yt page, im shook LMAO
Not good 👎👎👎👎
Do a full face makeup by ROMWE
"should we talk about our opinion about dune?"   "No i dont wanna get beheaded"   the man knows...
I'm sorry but when he was putting of the face powder he was  looking awful!
Ahm.. James.. Wanna be friends? I will watch your sent tiktoks.. I also worked on my fyp, I am sure we will have similar taste
Honestly, I don’t like Shein makeup products based on this video, but I had fun watching the video
I agree with you james 💖
Though I didn’t rlly like shein I badly needed jackets and you can get them like anywhere so idk bro
You forgot setting sprayyy!!!

I actually really like the eyeshadow it’s pretty! 🥰 Anybody else agree?

I get so many ads for that powder!!! lol
Wow James you look so good at the start of this video and that shirt girl shut up! Pastel is so right for you. 💄💅👄👠📿🤪
I think it  is  not  that  good  of  make up. You  did a good job  putting  it on.  Also  you  look  ok. It  was not  that  bad.
Pls go to dude pls James you are missing 😢😔🙏😞😭😫out
James can make any shit make up look fab!
Cali just cares more about the people and tells you and gives warning ⚠️
i like it
icl every time he uploads my heart lifts and im happier
Let’s just hope James comes back in the next video
The makeup look was definitely giving ✨blippi✨vibes
JAMES!!!! The R.E.M. Beauty line is supposed to be starting early November!!! What are your thoughts on it. And what are you hoping to expect? I can’t wait to see a review!!!
was it just my eyes, or was there some sort of filter on this whole video that made the side of his ear gray...?
Just leave the company alone even know this is ur opinion
Two be honest it looks ok..
Am I the only one that thinks James films most of his videos high? Not judging I have my own medical card just curious if it was only me
The body puff looks fun to useeee
Is it me or James has been losing subscribers
Actually, that not bad and the eyeshadow is pretty good.
James, stop risking your skin just for us to see btw looks good
I don’t like you but...JAMES? JAMES CHARLES? DOING A REVIEW ON ONE OF MY FAV MAKEUP BRANDS?
They way the have a good liquid blush and they buy you the one 😂 .
if james sent me a tiktok, i’d respond within a minute every time 😭
Idk it’s not the worst but honestly compared to other affordable brands that kill it wet n wild/e.l.f, it should be wayyy cheaper in my opinion
Can we like talk about James nails?? Beautiful
I like it.
James! You’re so funny and so fresh to watch, inspiration 100% Please so a full face of essence makeup, the highlighter’s brand you used in the cheap vs expensive video
Ceyou. Do a Hello. Kitty  meyk. Up
your eyes look red, that's not good
100,000000/100,0000000
Props to James for making any brands makeup look amazing 😂 ❤️
It may be bad but looking at your creation gurll look fantastic and not that bad even though it doesn't go along with your purple wear still look fine to me.
“You ask and you shall receive” ite, gimme 1mil James
I really only watch these for the commentary in the back
The amount of hand movement in this video 😂
Can you guys, translate into Arabic  💛💛
The makeup looked good just not the blush with the eyeshadow color
PLEASE TRY SOUR PATCHS MAKEUP LINE!!  <333
"my crease is cut with my salad concealer" 🤣🤣
it was OK
You should do a full face of L'oréal Paris Makeup! Love your makeup James!
Omg u should try out yesstyle Korean makeup
James: This blush is just not giving what its supposed to be giving Me: thinks of Dojas IG Live* Doja Cat once said: It did not give... what needed to be gave... to be highest... of giving
James... That puff... Nooo... It made you look greasy HAHAHA other than that everything was fine tbh lol
James literally slating Shein… Me who literally owns half of these items and uses them daily: 👁👄👁
Almost all of my makeup is from shein
Try fashionnova makeup
This man with no education really said the FDA is outdated
James looks the best he's ever been! his skin looks nice, hair best, and his outfit, great. even down the the nails. his skin for some reason looks a lot better than usual, almost plump
I was just looking at shein makeup reviews yesterday Ty this is crazy
Personally like like this style of content, just dream and George having fun
Idk why are you complaining tbh! First, It looks soooo good and the price is amazing! Second, you can’t compare it to high brands! like what’s the point of the video! you ordered it from shein
Or do a CLOTHES HAUL WITH FASHION NOVA , SHIEN AND OTHER CHEAP CLOTHING WEBSITES 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
AHH, So pretty james rocks any make up look!
still obsessed with the new intro. vocals are insane 🤩
DO A VIDEO SHIEN OUTFITS TOO !!! 😁👏🏽👏🏽
DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM SHEIN
i like it but idk bought u
♥️♥️♥️
I feel  like the eyeshadow could look good
His makeup really said 🇺🇦
DO A SHEIN CLOTHING HAUL!😆💗
OMG james’ top is giving Techna from Winx vibes! so cute!
The  makeup looked amazing!
Why would you promote this?
omg James love your vids btw it will mean the world to me if you reply I've been trying to get you to reply for almost a year pls reply😍😍😍
Hi
It gives me beach vibes. James can you please recreate that eyeshadow look with your pallet or a different pallet.
Rich people need to buy in their pay range and leave cheap stores to people with far less money. It's okay you did this bcuz you do makeup and it can show people if it's worth it or not to even spend money they don't have to spend

lets just talk about how james can do an ok makeup w any product
Your makeup looks great but in my opinion the pink lip stick dose not look great with that eyeshadow.
Glad im not the only one who really didn’t feel great about Dune the movie😬
personally i like to get cream products fro she in, because they aren’t so full coverage they’re nice for when i want to go for natural, minimal cover looks, i don’t purchase sheglam when i’m trying to find a full coverage product
Hey James can you please make a video  where you recreate makeup looks from Instant Influencer? I loved the show and now i’m watching s2 with ZHC. 💕
I actually like it u make anything work sister 🦋
🔥🔥🔥🔥

“My crease is cut with my salad concealer” -James Charles 2021
Can you do a make-up review from florence by mills?💜
But how were the sponges tho??
James u look so beautiful ❤️

Tomorrow it’s my birthday 🎂
Fashion is great from shein
"tight in front of my salad!?" the gays know
Not Right in front of my salad! 😂
its ok
James looks like Daisy Duck on that thumb nail 😂
James your makeup is flawless even tho the product is bad,you make do and do amazing.I cant even cover a pimple in the morning =')
Girl I think it looks amazing and you did it
You still look great even with the cheap stuff.
You should do a full face of makeup using Amazon products.
Yeah, no I don't think these products worked well together
Everything was a bad formula but to me it looked fine and the eye shadow looked really good!
Sooo Gob mykb my from 🇸🇦...
You should do makeup from Sephora 🥰
I love the eye shadow look the most
yaaaaaaaas so excited for this video!!!😁😘
you see, im a mexican guy, and besides havin fun watching the content of the vids, i enjoy learning to understan english language by listening james charles talking SO FAST!
COULD YOU PLEASE DO MAKEUP IN THE DARK !! 💖
Ummmm, no!
Sister... you didnt try any shein lashes. They are quite popular for their lashes hmmmm. I heard youre coimg our with more makeup. Are these your LASHES???? interesting....
I am i the only how think this, is James still a virgin??
Does anyone know where James gets these shirts from??? 😭😭
I LOVE IT OMG
Your nails are giving me christmas vibes💅🏻🎄
Dude, your lighting is too good to register any flaws with products :P
I used to adore sheglam makeup I feel like you already decided they aren't that good before trying them🤣
This was actually a very helpful video for me. Rly enjoyed it <3
For shein, its actually not bad but for your usual make up... Yea they bad
James looks so pretty in any makeup look He's just sooo gorgeous 😀💕
It’s pretty to me it just clashed with your outfit
OMG YAY!!!
Pleaseeeeeeeeeedeeeeee jammesssss
Ok but James looks absolutely gorgeous in this look. I love all the shimmer personally and the lip color was beautiful on him 💕
IS HE ENGAGED?!?!?!?
7:00 flashback Mary has entered the chat 😂 Jk love you James😍😍😍
Yeah, I didn’t like this one either, James. Lol
I just had to pause the video. The 🫖 just killed me omg 😂😂😂
“shein contributes to fast fashion” *continues to spend £137 on a makeup haul type thing*
Rude james
I’m your biggest fan I am Aubrie and. I am 10😂😂❤️😍😏😘Hi sister
“My crease is cut with my salad concealer” 😂💀
I’m your biggest fan I am Aubrie and. I am 10😂😂❤️😍😏😘Hi sister
Y'all the makeup was fine given the fact that the price is 📉📉. It does look good because first, the lighting and the set up is everything. Second, it's james face duhh he's gorgeous purr. And lastly, he has a TALENTTT. What's the use of having so much high end and expensive makeup if u don't know how to blend? U know what i mean? Duh
👁️👄👁️U G L Y, you ain't got no alibi.   ✌️Peace, punch, captain crunch, I got something you can't touch.  💅Bang bang, choo choo train, wind me up, and do my thang.   🤣Reece's pieces, 7UP.  You mess with me, I'll mess you up!
FULL FAVE IF MAKEUP FROM DILLAR Tree
Ok, sister. The blue eyeshadow was good but not the yellowish-orange color on top sis. And that, should I say "lipgloss" is horrible. Like sister horrible.Good thing you didn't have to go anywhere after that video.
No because the names remind of tumblr for some reason
James " you ask you shall receive " me can I have a million dollars plz
I’ve actually tried a few of the shein eyeshadow palettes and I really love them, I ordered the primer a few days ago and I’m not really sure if ill like it, I’m definitely picky with primers
A Y LOVE YOU DRESS AND IM IT IS COME IN YOU VIDEO.
Happy bonfire night everyone 🎆🎇 !
ngl the makeup looks actually really goodd !! i love how he was able to pull of such a great look with some not-so-great products
Hi ate jamesss goshhhhh yourrrr so gorgeous🥺😍 hahahahaha for me shein is not worth it , well maybe for those beginner but gosh u made the final look stunning❤️ magandang Umaga from Philippines 🇵🇭
To be honest, the makeup was was fine. But I do think Wish was better!
Giving me very much granny vibes ❤️❤️😂
Nice top today James 😘😘
listen you make every thing look good AF so dont ask us
Tell me you love James without telling me you love James   HI SISTERS

I was gonna buy the eyelash curler with the comb but after watching i think im good.
Ajayyy!
And to this day I still follow James on tik tok and Instagram
James outfits is everything and cozy and love the nails they match the crop top and the into is so cool and loved the makeup love you james
Shein traffics slaves, I would avoid buying anything there altogether! Do the right thing!!
“My crease is cut, with my.. salad concealer” HAHAHAHAHAHA
i haven’t tried their makeup but i LOVE shein lashes
You should do a week worth of outfits from Shein!!!
“Shin” i felt that😩🙇🏼‍♀️💅🏼
Omg waited for this
I was WAITING for thissssssss
That's giving me very 2018 trying to look good vibes ✨
Can you get makeup from river Island
We want full face make up from essence
Can you Play squid game IRL
PLEASE TRY ILL MAKIAGE NEXT PLEASEEEEEEE
WEAR THE LONGEST PANTS!!!!!!!!!
Hi James! I love your videos but actually almost every other country has regulations on makeup as well as a ton of other products bc of all of the chemicals. The USA has the least amount of limits on our products we consume
Honestly, the makeup look was good overall, but the quality could be a tad better. Considering they are not named brand; I guess it's good to make due with what you have if you can't afford necessarily "named brand makeup" but considering the makeup price for the makeup was affordable you are gonna get what you paid for and honestly would rather get the drug store makeup instead no hate to shien tho they are still a good brand to buy from. But in my personal opinion, I'd prefer to buy eyeshadow from the drugstore than Shien. You look stunning as always sister! Thank you for informing us on the makeup from Shien! xoxo
and also, did anyone hear the lisp when he went into his second shade? 😭
I think you did a great , job and I think shine make up is great for someone who don't have a alot of money to spend on expensive brands
You literally have no taste
🏳️‍🌈CARD. THIS IS WHY I STAN JAMES
عربب
i REALLY want him to re-create flash back mary! 😭 this video just made me think of that.
Beautiful!!!
James whats your skincare routine? Like if you want his routine! 🥺
i don’t like how u talk down on something u haven’t tried before
I literally got the notification to this video while I’m shopping on shein , so weird
Ok idk if anyone else noticed this but when hi logo pops up Charles is missing an L
James I’m not sure if you will see this but if so can you pleaseee tell me where you got that shirt ??? The purple one !!
The powder giving flask back Mary vibes🤣
Honestly it was FINE James... I mean you could've had more variety but tbh I've seen worst so I think it was fine
I miss when he turned out looks no matter the products or the challenge
If you had a different outfit to go with the look you would look even more 🔥 ❤
OMG YOU DID IT😭😭
The makeup wasn’t that bad x James
Amazing as always
Okay but I want your top hehe🤍
The commentaryyyyyy !! just ties the video together i lovee! 😂💕💕💕💕
James looks good with anything❤️
The look looks 🔥 the foundation and concealer look so full coverage I’m gonna try
James you can send me tiktoks all day and I will watch them
I think the makeup looked fine. Personally I wouldn't choose SHEIN as a place to shop for makeup because I would be worried about the quality of the products, but I have bought some really cute clothes from SHEIN.
was the eyelashes from shein?
Do it but with a drag look
I have the foundation and I love it. It works really good on me and last all day
I am fucking in love with him.... And i am single just becuze of him  I know i am crazy ..anyway  Love u
I actually liked the blush and contour 😅
L you fell off
James … you look like a grandma 👵 lol SHEIN did not serve.  Love you though ❤️
On SHEIN I got a makeup book
you barley showed 1/2 of the products....wish we could've seen more.
That makeup bag looked like ur baby milk insulated bag lol
6:27 NOT THAT CLIPPPPP💀💀💀
Hey Sister James.. You know whatever brand of makeup you will used for your face will  absolutely look stunning. You look super pretty.. you make the Shein brand look so expensive in your face. Good job.  I think everyone who is in budget would purchase that makeup after seeing this video . So do I ❣️❣️❣️
13:08 “my crease is cut with my salad concealer” THAT CAUGHT ME SO OFF GUARD LMAO
James needs to stop blurring his face, we can’t really see how the product looks because everything is smoothened!
Can you pls test the swedish make up brand CAIA?? I would love to See that❤️❤️❤️❤️
The lipstick thoo girlll is stunningggg
I loved the look I just think you shouldn’t have used a couple of the items
it actually looks good
James you are so talented and awesome. All the love and support to you from Jamaica
James you are so talented and awesome. All the love and support to you from Jamaica
I just feel he was gonna talk bad about Dune and I think I’m just biased but I was gonna pop off if he said ONE bad thing
😍😍😍
my miss the screaming
JAMES YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL EVEN IF YOUR MAKEUP LOOKS BAD
I love the look
Comment 1412❤😂😂😂
Hello James i love your vídeos 💜
💘💘💘💘💘💘
💝💝💝💝💝💝
💞💞💞💞💞💞
💙💙💙💙💙💙
❤❤❤❤❤
welp I guess I am taking the shein makeup in my cart out :p
It looks amazing i think the lashes brings it together
I wouldn't buy the make up from Shein, but you actually made it work and it looked decent haha. 😅😅
It looks nice!
hope you can also try palettes from beauty glazed
I’m very interested in makeup and his videos are sooooo inspiring! If he were to see this it would make me so happy 😍
Omg James trying shein makeup Iv never throws there makeup but I love their clothes literally obsessed
ATTENTION: do not order from shein, they use child labor!!!!!!!!!
That warning label on the primer is the same warning label on all Taco Bell food
I like the  eyes but the blush is just something else I think it is way to pink for the look
James is just being super harsh. His approach is already negative whereas if you're going to judge, your approach should be unbiased so you're able to be honest.
NEW VIDEEOOOOOOOOO, YES
in my opinion, it looked weird.  because I'm used to natural looks.
It’s so pretty
James Charles is a very good makeup artist! 😀❤👍
next u should do aliexpress !!
that top is pretty
I think it looks AMAZING!!!!
I love it James so cute!!!
Yeah I definitely would not try SheIn
Nothing was wrong with it I think you just you just don't like them it's your opinion
I think you looked nice 🥺
It looks good even w tht shirt lol it doesn’t have to match exactly James
He’s so pretty omgg!
You should do a full face of make up from target
recreate twilight and use the sparkly puff to give a nice shimmer ✨
I like the base but the eyeshadow…….. I’ve seen better no offence
The eyeshadow colours are really pretty fr
i would watch the tiktoks bae
You should do a 100 layer challenge with makeup
Uhm JAMES U DIDNT EVEN REVIEW THE EYEBROW PENCIL
Sister u look beautiful with and without makeup I love your style you are like my inspiration we love you  you are the best❤️❤️❤️
To be honest that's not a bad look for him even though it's not his forte on his normal glam looks
i was bored while ago... but wait James has just uploaded a new video...maybe people make fun of me but it was really really changed my mood..love u James❤
JAMES!!! loved the video🤩 so funny😂 please do more gaming videos please😩
why the sun came threw and said, bitch watch this werkkkk
I insist on loving fridays sister James ❤️
Oh wow wheres that top from 😍
I love it James it's just sat I think sheehan could work really God on their M makeup products because it is all of that could have killed you anything very bad for you yeah it's OK but I should look hideous how
California is the state with the law that says you always have to say if certain elements are present, no matter how small the quantity is. In most cases, other states don’t have the warning because the amount is negligible
Plz help me how do I get rid of bad acne on my face btw I love uuu
Te quiero James ❤️ hermana  i love you James ❤️ sister
for me it's a 8/10 it look great i love the eyeshadow so much For u it's a 6/10  (cuz you're a makeup artist who used to look perfect) i don't like how the contour and the blush look on u
Don't know much about makeup but I do know what I like. You're face is gorgeous but I think your eyes need work.
giving 13 going on 30 vibes ✨
I can't wear makeup as I'm too sensitive or allergic.  So I live vicariously through you.  Love your shirt color combo.  I think the base and contour were good.  Not a fan of the highlighter - though I loved the "gold puff" at the end.  Your eyes looked stunning.  Though you're right - they didn't go with the outfit.  Here's a quote that comes to mind for you sister: “Ordinary people believe only in the possible. Extraordinary people visualize not what is possible or probable, but rather what is impossible. And by visualizing the impossible, they begin to see it as possible” ― Cherie Carter-Scott
Plz do lady gaga make up review 💋
It honestly doesn't look that bad
are we not talking about shipping being £64 WTH that’s so much
best part of fridays
The glitter puff us literally a knockoff of Fenty Beauty’s glitter puff 😂
i love james charles
The back round music he has is the same music as Coleen
James can you get another vídeo in spanish latinos and latinas love you sister ❤️
He still looks good though..
US don't have any restrictions compare to Europe !! Your things (make-up, food...) are too chemical and it attack your well being.
Do a full face of huda beauty
Maybe I would try the lipstick....
Actually James yes it can be true they have that many reviews with that many five strata so many people but from shein I mean so many and most because of tiktok leave a review I’ve done it myself every single time I shop from there
Makeup 👎 nails 👍
I really want to see him to work with makeup from ipsy one day. Please? 🥺🥺🥺 or do a collab with a fan.
I can say from my point of view. Makeup look is really good. But I could see that some of the products that you did use did it really blend in together very well. And I feel like the look at so they release it as well with the outfit you were wearing. And the color is really cute we can say it could have been better. And I don't blame you cuz you do have expertise and doing makeup I blame the products. And they all had like a little gold Sparkle to it and I didn't like how they have all their products with a gold Sparkle.
I would really love to see you make a video about products that you use everyday. I would love to see you educate your viewers on the best products and how to properly use them. Like me personally, I love doing my makeup but what I've noticed is no matter how hard I try my makeup seems to wipe off really easily throughout the day and I absolutely hate that.
you know he loves us when he risks camcer for us. Love u james <3
You look amazing 🤩
🥰
10:51 not James trying to recite our kindergarten/ 1st grade vibes
Everything fell apart from the foundation. Way too oily!
I love the look it cute 🥰
I love your shirt James!!! So cool!
I think it would of looked a lot better if he used like a light pink for the eyeshadow
Keep the makeup, burn the clothes.
What the hell is on your nails
Tbh it's not a masterpiece but it was fine like an average
That top though😍 I love your videos I hope you go back to posting more often!! Once a week isn’t enough 😭
James, you have a large audience in brazil, what do you think about adding subtitles in portuguese?
james face looks shiner than a new iphone 😶
Don't know if anyone said this but when u write a review on SheIn it gives you points that convert to discounts, so don't believe all the reviews if they don't show an image or something.
Sister James, how pretty you are
“My crease is cut, with the salad concealer” 😭
u hate deaf people
A lot of people on Shein give good reviews just to get savings points.
Hello sister, you are very pretty ❤️
Hi
Its literally fine
I loved how low he was on this video it seemed calming 😂❤️
James makes anything look good so I am not sure why he’s tripping . 🤣😂
How can u not try the liners and colored liners!! Also, I enjoyed Shein make up. I think you’re too used to eXpEnSiVe make up
So everyones forgor
James,want a kawaii makeover piwijjjjjjj
Esque solo en California sale el sol 🌞 🤣🤣🤣😅OMG Shein

✯ᴗ✯       ꈍᴗꈍ         ◕ᴗ◕ ✿     ✿  ♡‿♡👑  I love you James you are beautiful ◍•ᴗ•◍ ❤ 🌟🤩✨
Love this video James❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍😍😍😘😘😘😘😘😛😘😛😛😘😛😘😘😘😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Ooh love this James!!!!!!!!! I’m so sorry for all the hate

But why do his eyes start looking so red after he put the eyeshadows on!? Poor James lol
Hey, 1 hour ago better then, a day ago am I right.
Guy’s am I the only person watching James Charles makeup videos and stills can’t do her makeup no matter how hard i try  Please let me  know am not the only one  Makeup is a work of act and if you can do it well  You are an artist purrr But I still love watching  his video for fun knowing am not good at it😔
The makeup was fine... Until the EYE SHADOW because Girl..that's when it went wrong.
The reviews aren't "paid" necessarily, but shein gives you points for every review and like on the review and giving a higher review means more points sooo
Love this
😂 lol
SHEIN Is pronounced SHEEN not she in. Sheins clothes are so nice sometimes
"that looks like a torture device" 🤭😂
James please make a squid games video with the others from the among us video, it'd be col
Do a review of Fashion Nova makeup
12:29 James?
I love this aaaa
Do a review of arianas makeup when it comes out on Nov 12
Hey James, LOVED this video, but for the next one I would love to see your ‘everyday’ makeup routine with your fav products. Thanks!!
You should wear only shein for a week video
Buying things from Cali scares me I rather stick to the ones without the warning label 💀
James I like your nails you did them good!🌟💕🌼
When are you going to do squid games in real life ?
IT LOOKED PRETTY GOODDDD! YOU LOOK SO PRETTYYYYY
Ok but shein accessories is where it’s at 😩

Full face of dollar tree makeup
Honestly the look was fine but I agree with u James, some of the products didn't do it..
yesss pay the child labor company 😍😍🥰
Can you try full face makeup from 1 dollar store
Love the shirt  Period sister James!!!! Love you the most 💓 💛 💗 💖
you should buy James makeup but not tell him where it’s from so he can give a review based on makeup w out knowing the price or store
I love him shedding light on the positive and negative effects of shien cause it's clearly there
I just don’t understand how James can make every single look STUNNING!! Also, HUGE respect to the editor, I couldn’t stop laughing!
You are my favourite youtuber 💖💖
Do a ebay full face look and I'll share it to 277 people
Do a full face of makeup from Amazon!
Love you James❤️❤️❤️
YOU SHOULD DO A FILL GLITTER MAKUP OMG 😱
Hello james .. please try local Brand from the Philippines .. like Vice Cos. BLK Cos .Colorette Cos. Thank You and Godbless 😘😘
Oh my god I was waiting this video for so long .😖🙌 Love you James 💕
it looks pretty lol
I’m sorry but instant influencer season 1 is way better than season 2
What days do you post????????
This makeup look looks ok it doesn’t look bad
Sister u rock
I watched dune and I LOVED ITTTT
Cm
DING DING DING SOMEONE SAID SHEIN RIGHT!
Its not cute to me tbfh
Next make sure to check the reviews especially the ones with pictures shein is good quality and cheap but people don’t check the reviews with pictures then you can actually see if the product is good
Omg i bene waiting for someone to do this I LOVE U
You should do the most expensive face of makeup
I think the pallet has potential I think the colors were pretty giving and you could do something with it and I think the foundation wasn’t bad at all I like how much coverage it gives, but that concealer and powder is a just big no for me 😂 overall I like what you did with the products, but I think ill stick to buying clothes from Shein 😝
Wow I was just shopping for makeup on shein what a coincidence 😅
i love timothee chalamet
james the look is SO CUTEEE
In my opinion... The makeup that you did is very beautiful... But the blush is a little bit off... Also, we all know that you are one of the best makeup artists in the world and you can do a lot of different things on your face... That makeup is not the best bc you can do better! Love you sister❤️❤️❤️❤️
The reviews numbers are real because when you buy a product if you insert a picture and write a review you get points you can use this points in your next order to have a discount 👀👀 and add a coupon so you get double discount 🔥🔥
Personaly I never tried SheIn make-up but I have tried skin care and clothes on their and it's honestly amazing stuff but James love we all know that that make up look looks fine it's not bad at all honestly your bad is my best
Judy Garland
I am horrified
I really think the lashes always bring these kind of looks together - you look beautiful james! lol loving the puff work
Really looking like a twilight vampire in that sun clip
As much as i hate shein, am i the only on who thought he looked amazing?
I have about 4 eyeshadowpalettes amongst  the Artistry Palette and that one is fine, a blush palette, mascara, pro face palette with one bronzer and three highlight shades, Contouring Palette and 2 liquid lipsticks and I am exited about almost every product. But you know James, you can not compare a budget brand with a high end brand, if both were equally as good than why should you buy high end, just for the name?!? Although the colors did not match your shirt you made it work! Also I bought your eyeshadowpalette (the big one) and I am gonna review it really really soon on my YT Channel!
Ok look Queen I love you but wtf is that shirt
Love you sister
You look sister stunning in  any look but you should feel beautiful not me telling you so yeah that's my opinion. Can't wait for more videos and new looks and new challenges  Love ya 💗
I have been waiting for this 🤍🤍🤍💀✨✨✨
Every time I feel like super manic and depressed I just zone out watching James Charles and I feel like I feel so much better after
not hate or anything ofc but isn't it pronounced more like sh-a-yn or sh-e-yn or something like that and not sh-ee-n? btw really enjoyed the video and anyone reading this - have a nice day. :) <3
I’ve ordered from Shein before and they literally spam you with emails about reviewing products and then if you do you get lots of point which can get you discounts for the next order so I think that why there’s so many reviews <3
"This makeup is like a Monet, from far away it's ok but close up its a big old mess" - Cher Horowitz
SALAD?
I really don’t like it on me but on u yes sister
hi James huge fan loved today's video but I definitely will be sticking to my usual products but i found it hilarious that a shade of concealer was called "salad"
I dare you to talk without using your hands to show expression of what you're saying
How about you could do a full face using foundation
James you're amazing seriously i am obsessed with your channel and you btw you're nails are amazing
I love your top
i love the edits😭
I like it but not really
I don’t know why I’m watching this but so much love from Mexico 🇲🇽 Charles
i died when he pulled out the salad concealer
So pretty 😍💗
Your makeup is fine
First of all i have never seen james with hot red nails... His nails are always baby pink ire nude or maybe some blue shades...  Btw love it gurl!!
I like the eyeshadow colors and the lipstick but not together and the face products aren't the best looking especially the blush
Okay  not going to lie you look good with makeup and with out makeup but you look good
I think it actually looks really good but what doesn’t on James
People put 5 star reviews on shein so that they can be on the top because bad reviews shien hides
hi james ur my idol i love you so much :)
Hi james Charles your makeup look Good
Sorry James, but no!!! Please wash the brushes and sponges before use!!!!!
So many memes 🙄
Hello my name is Marwa from Iraq and I live in Germany as refugees and I would like to try the makeup you produce, but unfortunately I do not have the money to buy it and I am honored to follow you
I love shein
em why did it kinda giveeee hunny 💅
It looks greaaaaaat hehe ( yeah that’s goinbg to be a no)
THANK YOU
Sister where did you get that shirt it's  so cute
That palette had so much fallout, I imagine if you used even a few more shades in this video, it would quickly start to look the way yours does after years of using it without cleaning it.

i love your shirt james!
USE ONLY MORPHE PRODUCTS RNNNN
James what're your review on the movie Dune by timothee chalamet and zendaya?
USE ONLY MORPHE PRODUCTS FOR A VIDEO
Cute
Lol I'd watch all your tik toks
It looks nice omg
James u are the influencer that trys help all of your fans by trying new products and risking your own skin if they have chemicals u don't know that but u still try it love u for that James thx for being to kind to us 😘
You should make a series when you try out OUR makeup routines!
Try on clothes from SHEIN please!! Love you sister ❤
You should do an outfits videos from SHEIN
The gloss took me out ngl 💀😂
Its great but the blush its just not giving it yk
🤩❤️💕
Next Up Pottery Barn Teen
SQUID GAME IRL
Hi sister
James u looking amazing
Early (kind of )
People on SHEIN rate it 5 starts because they get points if they rate the items high!
okay but salad- we love her
More Videos James
Love you James ❤️
Yaaas so excited James !!😄😄😄
Use Walmart makeup products
James could u do a collab with Laurdiy plssssssss ❤️
I NEED THAT WORKOUT SHIRT anyone know where its from/?
James flopped
UAYYAAYAYYAYTA
Love youuu
it’s not the worst. but it’s not the best. it’s still pretty. if you had black on or blue or gold then it could work🤍🤍 love you sister 🤩💄
the lack of definition on the close-up shots, girl go easy with the filters, we see u
the outfit is just chefs kiss💋
OMG MY CONFIDER IS THE SAME COLORS AND DESIGN AS YOUR SHIRT!!! AHAHHA
SHEIN is a huge fast fashion brand meaning that they are not sustainable and do not partake in fair trade . PLEASE PLEASE stop supporting slave labor and enivronmental crisis
James it’s sure has been a while since I watched one of your videos  This made my day
I like shein eyeshadow and their powder puff to set my face but I mix their powder with airspun to get the shade i want. I loveeee all their clothes and head accessories.  Try a video like that.
Thumbs up if James Charles is fabulous!
Its so pretty like why doesnt he like it
heeeeyyyy
It’s good on camera but behind not to sure lol 😂
Please just do a collaboration with my boo mills ❤️
wow, where'd the lips come from suddenly?! :O
IT IS NOT BAD
Do from etsy next
Loved this video and the makeup actually looked drugstore product standard (at least from far away), my under qualified verdict is that it was really pretty 🥰 Definitely not the right top tho 😂
Okh james you have to doo the video of using make-up from different countries 😳
I ment dm
Thank god you posted sister now I can eat and watch a good video YAY
Here in an hour  * claim here *
I don't think I would use Shein or Wish for makeup. It's honestly not that much cheaper after tax and unfortunately are supporting fast fashion. I see so many amazing drugstore tutorials on you tube to help contribute to healthier industry while looking incredible on budget.
No one’s talking about how James flipped us off🤣🥲
You ain’t got no alibi! Haha James is cultured on trends before his time, ok? 🥰
I like it personally. Being able to keep up with trends even if you work minimum wage is good in my books🤷🏼‍♀️ but like he said, its controversial
You should do Etsy
James, you should do a video of showing all of your makeup and makeup stuff
@James Charles
i have the foundation and its my holy grail
Go
you should do a full face of 5 below makeup
Keep in mind shein gives points (which can be redeemed as coupons) if you leave reviews on their listings. That’s why many listings have 1000+ and have 5 stars
I love your videos James
James can make anything look good
I love u sister
it looks good
I died when I seen the clip of the girl saying " not in front of my salad" if you know you know 😂😂😂😂😂
I really ENJOYED this video!!! thank you sister
IT LOOKS GOOD JAMES!
pls do food vids plsssssss
I wish James could bring flash back marry for one day😫
Isn’t his shirt from SHEIN?
This is literally the first time that i hated james eye makeup😂
James you are an amazing sweet person and your makeup looks are phenomenal and beautiful I love u and I have been watching you for 2 years and a half year and I love u so so so so so so so so so
“SALAD?!” “SALAD.” 😂😂😂
its actually really good better than i could ever do! your amazing James! 🤣😊😁👍❤
NO DUNE SLANDER
My favorite foundation is from shein. Can't find anything that's better or can even compare with the price.
I LOVE YOUR TOP OMG
I’m not getting an open minded vibe at all. You totally went in with a condescending mindset…
Ya
You should look emo for a day
For me I don’t like to wear heaps of make up I find a lot of foundation very heavy and thick on my face I would like to try the foundation out and see how it feels .
The reason why it’s got so many good reviews is because shein shoppers can write a good review and get points which goes towards money off their products :)
The color combos do look weird but I still think it ended up looking really pretty haha
IT LOOKS AMAZiny
James I love u so much , I always become so happy whenever I watch your videos. Thank you for doing what you do ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
How does he make everything look awesome 😝😌
Your video is too face tuned, make it real and maybe reduce the filters
The kettle 😂😂😭❤️
Worried about shein makeup 2:37
this look was gorgeous but with a different outfit and maybe another brand not shein
Be it Shein, Or Chanel or Nars Or YSL- James can literally create the best makeup look from products of any brand and that is the reason- I love him so much- And can we miss out on his nails- They look so sister freaking good-
Hi sister! ilysm
Tbh with you it actually looks really pretty I'm not gonna lie I love it james 😍🥰
Will you do Among Us in real life again?
do a clothing haul from shein.
This was posted 35 mins ago and it already has 11K LIKES!!!!!. Plus mine
Regarding the reviews they give points for every review you give and you can trade your points for  discounts so people do review as much as possible
James omg this video is wrong Shiens sells clothes that are made from child labour
Amazing from chloe from wirral xx
Do a whole face of Sophora products
Hiii James So like the makeup products you used were really bad cause I have tried them or well most of them and well hats of to you , you created a presentable makeup look out of almost nothing you are sooooooo talented and I love you the absolute most
So the face was just not it, but the eye shadow look would look absolutely STUNNING if you recreated it with your pallet! (and probably put on a shirt that matched haha) <33
salad
Can you do a full face with essences?
Not sure where you live but in California we get this warning on almost everything we buy, including name brand products in the US, even non food and cosmetic products like household products, toys, clothing, and furniture.. If we care about that label we pretty much are out of options
I was literally just thinking about watching a video of yours and a notification popped.Thank you James!🤍
Love you James ❤
Californias Prop 65 is a joke! Lol  please dont worry. I'm a lab technician and I work under my mom who is a personal care chemist.
Is it just me or is James’ eyes look pinkish red at the end???
Not to mention child and horrible labor
Can you please do a full face of makeup from Walmart
james is salad ahah
Rest in peace sister
yummy
james underestimates his makeup looks... me watching this and i could never
Do makeup with essence...
SHEIN has the best eyelashes . You will never find anything better. Can’t convince me otherwise
I love you, James you’re so inspirational
I knew these products wouldn't be the best but I just came to see James rock this as usual , also that's a cute top i can't stop looking at it
THANK YOU
Honestly I love SHEIN makeup Some of their makeup I use a lot
SHE(in) DID NOOT
I think the makeup looks great, queen 🤪🥰💖
Cute makeup
this looks 1000x times better than every makeup look I've ever done and i thought i was good at makeup. sorry james 🤡
I would love to see you trying on products without knowing the brand or if they are high end, drugstore or super cheap ones. I guess when you know they are cheap your brain is already biased, so a better review would be in a blind study type try on
As far as I understand it, those Proposition 65 warnings (like the one on the first product) are totally worthless. They’ve labeled every other thing under the sun. It’s a ‘cried wolf’ situation to me.
I think it's fine!
You should do a cooking video of cooking your mom’s Facebook recipes :)
Your makeup is horifing today
I've done my nails yesterday and it goes perfect with your outfit 😍 you look beautiful sweetie❤🥰
New video idea  Start to challenge people on the street and if they win give them a make up shoppingspree
Can you do a llama mackup look
You should have tried their mascara it is bomb!!
James can make any kind of makeup look good 😍😍
The make up is cheap so you can’t expect a lot. It think it is good for beginners to use to practice. Just remember to wash it all away because cheap products can cause acne.
15:30 I think James is looking glamorous to me. I really like the shinyness  on him ✨😍
Hey James can you do another sing off with Zedd I loved those or maybe someone else maybe Larry
LOVE YOU
I think it’s really cute for some cheap makeup. I agree that the eyeshadow didn’t really match with the outfit. The lipstick was kinda cute actually. The blush was a little light, but you made it work, and I love the layering you did with it. ly 😊❤️
You are adorable 😙😙❤❤❤
❤❤❤
ياعيال حرام عليكم الرجولة وين😑
I think it’s beautiful 😍

For the price it was okay 🙄 you cant expect it to be like a high brand quality.
the makeup look is giving mildred from suite life on Zack and Cody lol
We always say that the makeup look flawless and really good just for the fact of James is a really fantastic makeup artist and can make products such as Shein's look amazing!!
Your videos always makes my day! You're literally the best person to watch when having a bad day.. love you James! <3
i bought shein makeup recently and actually really enjoyed the products that shein produce themselves (eg; the concealer and foundation) but the one thing that really upset me was their use of mica in their pallets. 😭
i like the look but with the shirt it doesn't look as good as it could have :)
I like it but you can do a lot better love your videos by the way but people at my school laugh at me because I watch you but I love you videos so if you can reply to me and say hi I will be really happy ❤️🥰
The makeup is def giving off Elsa ❄️ ✨ 🌬

Everything looks good. The eye color was wrong and didn't look like it blended well, but everything else especially the first lipstick looks good.
Salad?! 😂
7:55 THAT IS A GLUE STICK SISTER

saladdddd
The look is a no for me dawg
Shein
I love how he does videos that people comment just to make us happy. 💖
Yess I’ve been waiting for this
The eye makeup doesn’t look terrible what are you talking about James
7/10
claim your here in the first hour button here
Honestly it’s not too bad. But I can see how it would be inconvenient for the products not work well together.
Appreciating James Charles for doing so much for fans even though we don't what will happen to James Charles skin💎💎
Hi I'm a big fan
Do full face of meukup whit target
7:35 I don’t know about the stars rating but ik when u buy from shein and if u comment on everything u buy it gives u coins so they Review is 100% true
James looks like a marble cake. 💜
I can literally see his red
hi
you should of done the cream blush its amazing
I think this is very nice for the price too James is overreacting I try these products they look very nice on the face but James has a lot of money I don't think it suits him he just fits me the hard
It looks good
Looks ok. You just put the wrong eyeshadow on with shirt coloring.    It is what it is. You bought cheap makeup and got a cheap look.
James Charles makes my day luv you so much sister
You high asf
All jokes aside I love the look tbh
Hey james !! Loved the video and I just wanted to suggest another video idea,, how about doing a full outfit / clothing haul from shein? 👀😌
James your gorgeous!!! I would love to see you play piggy on roblox with ur crew <3 love ya💗
Bea u tiful
love u sister <3
It's been 37 minutes and he has 7.8 likes
you should do a full face of kock off makeup
Hello beautiful baby. 😎👏👏👏😘
Shein makeup is actually pretty good for it's price, you can't expect it to work like high-end products but it's not wish makeup either. Shein has their own makeup brand which is Sheglam so they're not robbing other brands. I've tried their foundation and I like it, their eyeshadows are ok, their primer is supposed to be a smoothing one
Watching your vids is my favorite part of the weekend!💖💖💖
In Christmas we gonna something good
I'm probably the cringiest person ever but I had a dream in which I and James spent a whole evening together. Probably the best dream ever ❤️❤️❤️❤️.
The eye shadow colours were not getting along with eachother
JAMES! You need to do a full face of makeup from dollar tree! Pls it would be so cool
James can you do a video with Another tiktoker or youtoube
Dislike
I always get so happy when you post a video sister <33
Hey
Poooopp
Omg sister James can put on trash and still look so good
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
i’ve heard the primer is great for oily skin? i’m so tempted to try it!
When he put the concealer on it made him look a lot like flash back mary😭
Them red acrylics are VERY distracting
SHEIN gives people points if they post a review, so if you looks at the reviews most of them will be 5 stars and lyrics. 😂
But seriously he inspires me so much. I love to do makeup because of him.❤️❤️❤️❤️ I really hope you see this James. We love you ❤️❤️
I love your makeup, it is beautiful
"GIRL WHAT THE FU-"
I guess SHEIN make up is for customers who don’t pay much detail on facebeats
RLLYYY slayed that look
I'm gonna be honest. Like James said that was probably the worst look ever. 😭
After watching I do want to try this line.  I looked at the site, and I was impressed.  The prices knocked my socks off!
We need one more to finish the series  make up from amozon
We love james!
James, the intro is so stunning on this video!!
Jamees! Why not i tried some bunch of clothes from shein They have some good stuff tbh
I never heard such bad reviews of Shein makeup, everyone else that I've seen review it pretty much loved all the products
bRFKt
James could rub dirt on his face and make it look glamorous. So talented and gorgeous!
love u so much james
Hes gorgeous💖
The look is not the best but it not bad
Full face of dollar store/ dollar tree makeup!!!!!🥰❤🙏 I am only 13 and you have inspired me since I was 8. You have bosted my self confidence and helped me love who I am. Thank you so much! Love from Canada!🇨🇦🙏
it looks good but the eyeshadow combo ruins it- lol
James! I need a hi pls. I NEED IT so bad u won't blv 😭
The makeup looks fine, I've seen other artists make them work and have positive reviews. Making fun of the brands names for their products is so unprofessional. Your palette also has fallout?? Dont know what the big deal is.. I really thought their was a change in James but everything is the same, humble yourself.
I love this!
I have those same brushes 😂 they do the job
Congrats if your here within the hour!
Hi James I love you so much and I hope you a good life and a good health 💞
He shouldn’t of done the lightest color of concealer No hate I love you James and I’ve been watching you for 3 almost 4 years now
We need a video of you trying to teach someone who is CLUELESS about makeup. I will absolutely volunteer!
I love their foundation. And their lashes, that’s the only makeup products I use from them
So cute 😋 😋 😋
It's look goooddd 💖
Yaassssss queen slay, love you james
This is what ive been waiting for!!!
It's fine and if you used other kind of blush it will look better... Idk I just like their products.
I liked the highlighter🔥🔥👏👏👑👑👑you seem to make any product look good!!! Gorgeous Queen 👑
It's time for James to do viral TikTok makeup reviews🔥🔥
Pls do a full face of E.L.F. Makeup
Nah James I didn't like it either. The look you did was as best as it could have been tho.
Everyone is actually living for that setting powder right now tho

It's looks nice but change your clothes it doesn't match
Early

Hi sister!! :D
love your outfit james
No, just no.
Why does he say SHEIN like that ???
James your new editor is EVERYTHING 😂
yeah its not the best
Lolol Shein gives you points for reviewing things and I believe you get more if they’re positive? I dunno, it’s a mess. But I also can’t stop buying their shit.
love you james for everything 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
I LOVE YOU❤️❤️❤️
My favourite part of my evening 😫😭 watching your videos!! 💘
ya i’m bouta drag you coz u still look good
you should try nail art or something
please tell me I'm not the only one who goes "Hi SisTerS!" with James whenever I watch his videos
This is perfect. I had bought the shein brush set that you used in this video and I also wanted to purchase the rest of the products, so this review is great!!!
shein is probably better quality than you
Doing my make up while listening 🥰

I’m here at 14 min mark
Idk but I feel like the reviews are real on shein cause NORMAL people use it and like it. So professionals can not give a negative comment as these products will never be used by them. It's for normal people who are not as talented as professionals so they like the products and can afford them as well no hate . Just saying you can't ofc compare normal makeup products for normal people to high end makeup products
"Hi sisters" Never gets old.
I love SHEIN for their makeup products, however you should try a clothing haul. Their sizes are a hit and miss
You could say SHEIN didn't SHINE
I love youuuu
my teacher who was maybe 40 or 50 sang that lmao
Idk about the formula...but eye look llooks good ☺️
We love a good coupon. 😂
James was complaining but I think it looks good
YESSSSSSSSSSSSS

Why are you still on the internet?
