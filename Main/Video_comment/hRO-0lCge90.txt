St. Matthew 5:36-37 And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or black. All you need to say is simply ’Yes’ or ’No’; anything beyond this comes from the evil one.
Don't use God's name in vain
REPENT FOR YOUR SINS

Loskis cropped his flow of aitch
Jesus Christ loves you so much and He will save us from our sins if we put our faith and trust in Him! because we all sinned and fell short of Gods perfect glory (romans 3:23) and the wages of sin is eternal death! (romans 6:23) but the gift of God is this   john 3:16-21 "for God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through Him. whoever believes in Him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God's one and only Son. this is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but people loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that their deeds will be exposes. but whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what they have done has been done in the sight of God."   and romans 10:9-13 "if you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord" and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. for it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved. as scripture says, "anyone who believes in Him will never be put to shame. "for there is no difference between Jew and Gentile — the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on Him, for, "everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved."   so God is coming at a time we least expect, and if we put our faith and trust in Him He will gift us His grace and clothe us with the righteousness of His blood (but of course death could not hold Him, He is risen!) and we will have eternal life in His kingdom where there will be there will be no more death, or sorrow, or crying. there will be no more pain, for the former things have passed away. because He loves you so much! (romans 5:6-8) but if we deny and reject Him and don't repent from our sins to follow God, then we will have our part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death. because no liar, no thief, no blasphemer (using Gods name in vain as a cuss word to express anger or disgust) and no adulterer (Jesus Christ says in matthew 5 that anyone who just looks at someone to lust for they’re an adultery at heart) will enter the kingdom of heaven. so hear these words, repent and believe the gospel! accept Jesus Christ and confess your sins to Him so that He will forgive you and give you a life with truth and real love and joy and peace that this world can never give you or fulfill in you you! and the love and joy and peace that He will give you will never fade away or perish. this is all if you haven't done this yet and Jesus Christ hasn't saved you yet, also when you have time please you should watch this channel here on youtube called "Christ forgiveness ministries" and hear what they have to say, glory to God. God bless you! 🙌👑💟 . .

Stormzy's a giant. He can do whatever he want..The best thing I like he wants to be all the time is he likes to be honest
Loski sounds like aitch
Celebs should not be on pedestals.  If I wrote that as a rap, it wouldn’t see the light of day... the masses are brainwashed with fame and fortune
This awful. Basic. School kids rubbish. They even sing the same shore chorus to eachother. Flavour and favour. Great rhyming skills. Jheeze.  What’s next. Hip hop and flip flop. Don’t stop the Pringles. They about to pop. Can’t believe this in on the radio daily... crap!
Ijele!
Look at the shit parking at the start. Yikes.
"Ok miss do me a favour, favour favour, na actually I don't want a favour"  I'm at a point where if the human race ended, I'd kind of accept that it's time
What did Loski mean when he said he “grew up in a Gaza?” Sick song btw
https://youtu.be/o_WYIzToBZI

What’s up guys!   I am a hiphop artist from the UK, I’m trying to gain a small following of loyal hiphop fans and am writing this in an attempt to reach out to people across the globe on the off chance they may take the time to check me out.   My latest song “Don’t Call Yourself A Rapper” has just dropped on my channel and I’d really appreciate it if anyone who enough hiphop could help me grow by taking the time to listen and subscribing if you dig my style.   Hope you all are staying healthy and happy in these dark times.  And a very Happy Christmas  #ADMHipHop  https://youtu.be/C0hzscEbAaU

Hi I hope you're doing well. I make music and it's really hard to have visibility when you're little, but I do my best to make my art known. I invite you to discover my beats and if you are not disappointed, do not hesitate to subscribe and share with your friends. Peace;)
Love how they made a song about selling illegal ice cream.
Loski has absolutely no versatility it’s the same flow delivery on every track or feature you hear him on he will fizzle out eventually this is dead 💀

Loski looks like Jesse Lingard

ok miss whats your flava wit this zk i might shave ya
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping you from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteous. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.

I know some people will hate me for this and try to discourage me from chasing my dreams because sadly this is the world we live in .. but I just wanted to say I just started music due to my mum falling with a brain tumour and my sister can’t walk or talk and we are all alone so I’m chasing a better life and music is the only ting I’m good at I just started and released my first ever track on my channel music is the only ting I’m decent at so if you guys could spare a minute to acknowledge me I’m in my learning curve 🏆 may god bless everyone life really is full of mysteries
#duckncover
Here looking for a stormzy reply?😭
"Do me a favour, do not do my any favours"?? I'm confused guys...
THE MILLION-DOLLAR QUESTION: Will you go to Heaven when you die? Have you lied, stolen, used God’s name in vain, or lusted (which Jesus said was adultery, Mt. 5:28)? If so, God sees you as a liar, thief, blasphemer, and adulterer at heart. If you die in your sins, you will end up in a terrible place called Hell. But there's good news. Though we broke God's Law, Jesus paid the fine by dying on the cross: "God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life" (Jn. 3:16). Then Jesus rose from the dead and was seen by hundreds of eyewitnesses. He fulfilled all the prophecies of the promised Savior. Please, today, repent and trust Jesus, and God will forgive you and grant you the gift of eternal life (Eph. 2:8,9). Then, to show your gratitude, read the Bible daily and obey it, join a Christian church, and be baptized. Visit NeedGod.com and LivingWaters.com

Loski making tracks with Stormz big moves👏🏾👏🏾 never would’ve thought the yute tgat started out in 016 wearing a bally who made hazards n DJ Khaled would one day get Stormzy on his album😅😅 big up to Loski tho shows how much he’s progressed over the years🙏🏾🙌🏾 hopefully now he can stop the foolishness n stay out of pen otherwise he’s juss gunna let his talent go to waste🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️ nice to see him include his guys Miz n Blanco too👊🏾👊🏾 but stop teasing us Loski man give us the track with u 3 together uno we all want it😤😤 the blue balls we’re all getting from these little teasers are too much now😭😭😭😭 u already did singles with them both individually now u can all link up together🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️ this track was hella commercial but if u wanna make something of ur life n wanna leave the roads behind u that’s what you’ve gotta do✅✅ look at people like Headie for example he’s gone clear now after doing the singing ting n leaving behind the hardcore drill👍🏾👍🏾 I expect to see Loski at that kinda status very soon🤝🤝
🤣😂😅😂🤣
‘need my lady and my blunt’ thought he said he stopped bunning
Loski's hands must be freezing cos the boy can't stop rubbing them haha
look like stormz driving his nephew to school fam
The thing that's annoying about songs like this is that if they actually went on a more rap or drill kinda beat they would have hit even higher numbers by now.. Probably 2 milli in 2 days tbh. They didn't need to try do this wavy beat ting especially when they both King's in their own ting. Silly move tbh especially when drill is on radio all the time now.
Tell those Americans how to spell 'FAVOURITE'
I wouldn't have known about this artist if Stormzy wasn't on the track. I'm happy for the collab, find a new interesting artist and see Stormzy doing some more traditional rapping style. POG
Loski’s come a very long way, glad he upped his game abd is consistent 🙏
half the tune was the hook
Aytt.. This is deadd 💀
Stormzy is just accepting defeat at this point.
Still waiting on Stormzy's Reply To Chip 🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️ 😂
Poo

Very catchy song
Sic banging tune
What car is that

Not bad, the way they got there caps irritated me 😂
How's the man acting like he doesn't even have to reply to chip😂😂trying to avoid getting embarrassed
Storm is COLD

loski calm down ight calm down cant show waps on the snap so i whow the bust down
Dead tune
Ain't gonna lie listening and watching this straight fire 🔥 track for the interest in it saying ( with Stormzy ) but stayed for that flow & delivery from Loski mans so cold 🤧 and was that Blanco & MizOrMac adding a little it more of a flavour to this qaulity video .. All a madness . Bless up . ✌📿💯
Oh that is my grandma 👵 😭😂😭
Garbage!!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥
cool kid flow thats hard
STORMZY: “don’t compare me to these guys, I am the king here, all these little rappers spending all their advances” -( jab at Chip)
They talk about “flavours” but their bars be dry as hell
🕺🏿🕺🏿🕺🏿🕺🏿
This is low-key the deadest tune from both of these two
15 seconds took me to press DOWNLOAD!

ThAt was soo good!!
So he’s just going to act like as if he didn’t even go to chips house And nothing even happened LOL
Steel Banglez does some of the best beats! This one, Fisherman, 47
Anyone else surprised to see Blanco at 3:37?
This is too commercial 😂
2:18 “Punching out your teeth Boy” The way Stormzy looked up when he said that was him looking up at Chip’s Apartment in that Video PMSL!! Anyway this is a banger just like “Flipz x WSTRN & Loski’s” song
Wavy tune still 🔥

UK rappers spin some roulette wheel when they want feat
But when you going to reply to Chip tho....
Banglez on the beat always🔥
stormzy might come back yano because he's making bare songs with other people but maybe
if this was on stormzy's channel it would of banged more views

Banger 🙌. Can anyone else hear Eminem the real slim shady??
Dead tune
Still no reply for Chip though. I feel Wiley getting reallllyyyyy active again. Other hand, Wiley hasn't "come for" anyone yet as well. Starting to think this is just another publicity stunt.
Dead
Epic
I Don't get the hook🙄
mizormac in the cut gave me chills , thought he would drop a verse but anywhooooo we move
Loski yes g stormzy washed fam
J Hus vibe.
1:57 I stopped my 9-5 with the help of, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
The Nigerian in me thought Stormz was the passenger when he hopped in the whip 😂.
Loskis Workrate 💯
Got the sweetest beat though still 😌
BANG BANG BANGER FLAVOUR
Loski really linking with everyone

Stormzy doing his up most to dodge Chip
https://youtu.be/NMFvWEsObwc
Hard collab for sure
Miz & Blanco cameo was too smooth
People better not expect some Chip disses this song was made and previewed last year😂
Featuring Stormzy means I’m listening.
How tall is loski
Is this a promo or what
Ok ok
“Hold on dont compare me to these guys yeah I’m the king here” “little rapper spelling all of their advances ah shit”
swear the beat is just the start of a kahoot
Old Loski 🤩
visuals and ideas wise UK have very talented people goodness
These two together are pure fire🔥🔥🔥
Miz and Blanco sneaking on scene😂😂
Here be4 a mil 💯💯💯
Chorus delivery reminds me of a 2002 Eminem song
Nice tune🔥🔥🔥
You have nice hands.

The car shots looks like stormzy taking his son on a school run
Man said both of us are a win win to an old granny

No ratings till you stop running from chip you pussyhole. You and drake retired now. Pusha and chip 👑
This is a ad..
Man said “with”
why does loski look like stormzys child looooooooool
See it's a good song but I'm 50/50 with the choice of Stormzy I cant lie
How can man call himself The King and can't even defend his crown? Maybe Ed told him about chips pen 0.o
Man still calling himself the king after running from chip, that's lannister energy right there
This tracks wack bwoy...Wtaf😒👎🏾
The two man that Loski is not allowed to be with are in this video. Miz and Blanco boying it 🤣🤣
I used to be a fan, but after hearing this masterpiece, I'm a whole air conditioner
why do they go so well together 🥶
Anybody know the instrumental?
There's only One JHUS....please don't try to copy
What happened to the chip reply.
Stormzys any guy.
All these rappers spending their advances 😂😂😂😂

This ain't Stormzy, this is Stiff Chocolate.🤴🏿
Banger 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Do me a fava. Kmt. This is rubbish
Who would of thought these two would be making music together🤝
Veiws are lackingggggg
“When I’m not around put me onto your playlist” He’s basically saying don’t forget about him if he doesn’t beat his case, hence the reason he’s releasing so much music.
Loski flow 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 levels
mizzy and blancs una

Loski will always be cold the way he can just switch up his flow
Kinda annoyed this is lacking views but it is what it is
Big up the grandma
Big strategic move from loski!
Like if stormzy is scared of chip
This was literally Stormzy bringing the mandem up to his Level!! This is more than just a tune.... this is love.
Man Stormzy can rap
Preferred Craig David's version 😂
This song is a mazza.
stormy standing next to Loski made him look like a kid 😂😂😂😂
Yeah yeah , flavour is all well and good .......... but stormzy, have you thought about replying back to chip yet ?????? 🤔😳😳😳😂😂😂😂😂

I can't lie I was expecting Stormzy to talk crud on a drill beat when I heard this collab was gonna happened
Big up Cr7/Sw16 🔥

Rahh is this the new thing in drill... chattin up grannies. Stormzy really desperate after getting bodied by Chip
Loski is growing as an artist and that’s amazing to see, I hope his album comes out and does a mazza!!!
2017 afro beat vibes
the way loski is able to switch up his flow and still sound wavy is why he’s top 5 in the scene rn

Waited 2 years for this
loski spazed fuck stormzy pussyboi tho
Stormzy the king of grime
First Loski  Then Ofb  What More can we ask for?
im not impessed but i like the beat
beat is too hard
Lazy
✋🏾✋🏾BEFORE A MILLY TICKET HERE!! 🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️
Stormzy the bottle arse
Gone heavy on the visuals on this one
Other rappers: "Ft/x Stormzy"  Loski: "With Stormzy"
Stormzy looking like Loski's uncle.... this is hard tho
Loski only brought a vid out for this tune with stormzy cos he knew it Would blow with him
Real Fans been anticipating this tune for ages
I pray who ever reads this becomes successful, and we can all arise...  (Thanks to everyone who subscribed as well👌)
Loski album gonna be disgusting 😅
I can’t be the only one that clicked the Eminem sample
2016 Lowski coming through again
You ain't the king until you reply to chip my guy
Stormzy stop running from chip

Trash!
Hard tune tho cold beat an unexpected collab. Need to get me some flavours 🔥🔥
loski is hardd
Skiiii go harrrddd❌🧢

Can someone explain the video concept ?
Who was here before 1 million
stormz probably weighs more than that car🤣🤣
Flavour delivery boys
Chip still spun you
The height difference is mad
Wavey 🔥🔥
Chip the king of the Uk scene, stormzy a pussy dodging and hiding from chip and still tryna claim king. Non of the real ones believe that, just ur white fanbase. You showed chip was better and ur self proclaimed status is more  important then ur pride.
I surly wasn't the only one rewinding stormzy verses trying to see if he said anything cheeky lol
loski been best in uk this year
Remix with blanco and mizzy
Loski is the king👑🤴
That random person who likes this will be come a millionaire one day
Stormzy calling in the backup...
Kings get beheaded.
Mad 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
1:44 when you bring your mother to school
Love to Loski for including Miz and Blanco in the vid even though can't be around eachother atm. That's real love 💯
Anyone else get gassed when they saw mizzy

Free Loose man, he’s got too much talent
Too repetetive and the actors are cringe as fuck
Stomzy really pulled up to chips nan
Absolute shit
Stormzy still ain’t replied to chip tho
SPARTANS
Love how they put mizzy and  blanco in this too
He's definitely not replying to chip..
Who’s better stormzy or chip
This is hard loski really been putting in work since he came back out of pen for the 3rd time and I hope it’s the last time he’s too talented to be rotting in a jail cell bmt
Here for the Ghanaian man🚀☈
Looski be getting good
My girlfriend said this is trash. She is married now!
Behind the scenes https://youtu.be/tLLsVG-7XMs

On the 30/06/2020 my younger sister Olebea Sinclair (Crissana) died under tragic circumstances. She was only 28 yrs old leaving 3 kids behind. On that day when I came home and saw her life less body on the ground I started crying and from then on I never stop shedding tears. I lost apart of me and I keep praying and hoping that one day I may find the strength I need to heal the continuous pain am feeling inside daily. I have been doing music over 15 yrs so i did this tribute to her life and memories, this has been the easiest and hardest song I've ever did. Take a few minutes to watch this video and listen. Feel free to leave a comment like and share. THANK YOU!!  Produced by K.M.T/ O.N.P Distributed by hapilos21 Video @xavieproduction #cry #ripcrissana #sip  https://youtu.be/fNH2RPTPlHE
