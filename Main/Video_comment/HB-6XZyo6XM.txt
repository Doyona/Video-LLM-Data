Thanks to the Cod3r for his repair attempt (Even though he definitely does not know how to apply the perfect amount of thermal paste! LOL). Check it out here and see if he could fix it! https://youtu.be/K1-re0bchew
I Bet You Could Fix My Xbox The Original From 2003 It's An Old Console, It Has A Non Stop Spinning Camera On One Controller Port, And The Other Moves The Camera To The Sky Without You Doing A Thing, I Know That's An Issue With The Mother Board. The Disc Tray Is Not Opening Because Of A Broken Piece The Needs Replacing. I Betcha Tronicsfix Can Fix A 2003 Xbox.
y a quien se lo enviaste?
I somehow never knew that roaches cause a smell. I guess I could have assumed, but damn…that’s so weird.
OH GOD ,WHERE A MASK
Our apartment got broken into when we went on a family vacation and they took everything including my God Of War ps4 :(
A console with Gooch powder...........................
I can disassemble items like this  like a PRO!!!!! ........ Its the putting all back together that gets a little bit frustrating!!! 😭😭
Telling the wife you cleaned up after a cockroach..........and paid $592.00 for that privilage!!!!
Roach smell never come out once it heats up it will release the very rare 500 million aroma of roaches
One thing that always bugs me, is you never use a vacuum!! Use a vacuum!!! You would be cleaning that heatsink out so much better if you were to be using one, instead of just brushing the dust around.
HTF do bugs infest game consoles?! Are these people living in trash heaps? Are they storing food in them? Wow...
That's not a repair, that's a parts swap and janitor service. Next time put that Motherboard in the dishwasher, youll thank me for it.
good job
I'm about 90% certain that the heat sink was full of dead skin flakes...
One of the ps4 pros i was cleaning had cooked ants all over the motherboard there was even a few ants that looked like they exploded across the board but found they were after the thermal paste
loved watching this vid since mid 2023. Crazy how u have a limited edition ps4 pro now
Ok. So I've got a question I've got a PS4 that continues to say data is corrupted CE-34054-6 and then restarts PS4 why is this?
Wonder if you double up on the mother board wonder what would happen
i have a white ps4 pro with the blue death light , can this be fixed by changing the motherboard or can i just throw it away ?
Not sure why someone buys a special edition and just don't care about it. Good thing the original owner sold it. It deserves much better care from someone else
el traductor  latino no jodas🤣
I had the blue light on my old one and just went into safety mode by holding the power button and reinstalled the software and worked perfect after
Bug infested! 5:10
I know this is an older video but I hope someone can help me with this. My ps4 is giving me the same problem as the ps4 in this video at the very end. Something about the software? I updated it from a usb and the internet but every few days the error page comes back up. Does anyone know how to fix that?
Pls gift me a playstation 5
He maks me laugh every time he buys something and says limited addition 🤣🤣🤣
Its now transformed from ps4 pro to the original ps4? I wonder if it did bcz you changed the motherboard???🤔
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉what
I got lucky and found one of these for $300 CAD locally. Complete in the box, but had scratches from use though. Looks like guy placed the controller, and games on top of the console :( I never drove faster for a marketplace pickup.
There all over ebay rn
People should spend money on getting rid of bugs in their place and not on PlayStations lol
whyyy don't you vacuum out the bugs right away
Sorry for the question, forgive me if i missed but what was the problem on the mainboard? What did you fix on it?
those bugs will soon be in the food you buy to help save the planet.
Heh.  I got one of the controllers never could find a console locally.
I'd just like you to know you just gave me a cockroach phobia with this video 🤢
Might as well upgrade to SSD
Some ppl don't deserve these consoles....😓  Tried so hard to get one, and the state on this one makes me so sad 😓  Well done 👍
the perfect amount of thermal paste love it 👌
Im trying to go to school for this.... I seen your videos bro and i know what i want to do!! As a kid always wanted a game never could get one cuz of no money or family dint want us playing games!! I want to learn this to help kids who cant afford one!!!
I take everything expensive I own apart for cleaning reason and being broke when I was younger to buy a new ones if it breaks I’m going on YouTube buying parts and attempting the fix regardless!
In Belgium you can buy a working one for around 1450 dollars and an extra 50 dollars for shipping it with insurance that they deliver it to your home
How the hell do people have bugs in their consoles. Like how nasty is your home.
Hey tronics. Love your co tent.  Is there a way that I can pay u to fix my switch it charges sometimes. I bought two. Different brand new batteries. I dropped it I. Water but it still works but I think maybe some oxidation or something is going on . but it works . but I've fully charged it but after fully charging it it show 100 then ten minutes later it battery I. The red. Please help my gaming enjoyment
If I were to ship my PS5 disc edition to you, would you be able to repair my PS5? Went to update system and says disc drive not recognized/available.
I really thought he was going to peel off that she'll it would have been so satisfying😢😢😢
Glad you won. German roaches are attracted to filth so it was a tax return purchase.
He could check the CMOS battery
Cod3r?
In my opinion translucent plastic on things like controllers make them look cheap
Why not a 2TB SATA ssd instead of an hdd
ive had one and kept the box i did know it was rare???
It's nice to see you glove up.😄
My ps4 is broken just broken
I got one of these from Best Buy when they came out I still haven’t opened it
What's so special about this playstation that you had to probably pay a lot more extra for and also broken, when all it has is an upgraded hard drive that you could have done to any playstation and a transparent cover, which you could have probably got a cheaper variant of online 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 I can't with simple-minded people, get off my recommendations, This is just as bad as the people who sell try sell on here the third party handheld emulators, when you can just get a laptop or PS Vita and do the same thing and its cheaper 🤦  It's like the Taco Bell gold playstations that came out every playstation, Go to Walmart and pick up some gold metallic spray paint and there you go 😂😂😂
What kind of pigsty was the owner living in,to have so many cockroaches in his/her PS4 ????
Mine is scratched up and I was looking into ways of maybe removing scratches? Theyre not deep just annoying. Thought about polish but a bit scared and unsure.
If I have a friend like you (who can REALLY fix electronics), I will be one happy person. 😂🤣
wow i can't believe some people are that dirty and living with that many roaches in there house , they sure have enough buy a new console instead talking that money fix for roach problem . i never could live in a home with roaches i live outside before i live with bugs, some people just don't care i guess
Just put it in a sonic cleaner?
This one's kinda like  .  Meh. You didn't fix the actual ps4
My man have the 500 million edition and the New York edition 😩
wait.. I have that
For the smell issue, have you tried placing them in a small space with an ozone generator for a short period of time?  I've seen those work wonders for cigarette smells in car cabins.
damn I will not touch that ps4 what so ever.
You talk too much. less talk a lot of work
The PlayStation 4 is no more. My PS3 is faster then that. There's no reason to save junk. I moved onto the Xbox. At least it works better.😂😂😂👍
Wow! Didn’t know that the PS4 Pro would be released on my birthday. (the one showed in the video)
I have the #1 built, i sell it for $20,000, sike i dont have it but i wonder who does.
"I've Been Trying to Find One For Years" it takes 1 search and u can buy it...
Never knew there was a 500 million edition
He’ll maybe send it to Linus
Hi, what are the bottles you use for the alcohol? As well as the squeeze tool you used? I checked your parts list but didn’t see them. Thanks and great video as always! Keep up the good work.
How much to clean my infest ps4
I bet the motherboard goes directly to the north side of that bridge...
ohhhhmagah
I really want to start but times are rough and idk how
Did you try putting the perfect amount of thermal paste on the original board?
Kinda hurts when you realize you basically paid 500 for just a shell, matching controller, and a few spare parts.
13:45  People ask me why I love my job. This. This is why. You get even more satisfaction cleaning something yourself.
For those asking about why roaches are in it. One answer hood.
You mention this is the 7th most limited version of PS4. Where I can I find that list?
I have a PlayStation that sounds awfully loud and have cleaned multiple times to remove dust and debris however it never gets any quieter and sounds like a rocket taking off when playing games
Who you send it to
*James May:* _Oh cockroach!_
As a collector this is ultimately worthless. Over time the gaming console it will be a PS5 to PS6 to PS7, PS#, etc. Making a “collector” series doesn’t make it a collectible. An original PS1 is a collectible. Like an original Apple. Not a 2GS or an 2E. An original.   Having said that maybe someone will buy it. But over time this one is going to become worthless. Love your fixing content though.
Put the motherboard thru the dishwasher with the best tablet u have then iso clean and low temp oven bake at 60-70c
I wish I had my controllers fixed by you 😇🙏🏻 my R3 button be stick drifting
Why not use a qtip or a rag on the fan blades to get it actually clean though? 😵
I started smelling maggots as soon as you pulled the metal plate off. No need for smell tv, I'm already there.🤢
Very cool
For me  it just a another PS4 Pro
Fixing to me is finding the problem fixing that u basically just engine swamped a car because it wouldn't start and saying it's fixed witch it is but not sending the ps4 away and just swapping the bored on something rare like that without having to just takes the value to a working ps4 is a transparent case It's simple no longer original it will be overhauled not repaired  If it wasn't as rare who would care but being that rare I would have put alot more time into fixing not replacing parts that number in my mind no longer means much just a case now
The PS4 Pro was a beautiful console. Easily the most visually appealing console of all time imo.
I’ve got the Advanced Warfare special edition Xbox one and I so badly wanna take it apart, clean it good and replace the disk reader but I’m too scared bc I’m not knowledgeable on it.
Umm, So, So what. I just Bought a 2023 Kia Stinger GT2, And it works just , well, awesome!! But IN real life who cares, and I'm sure you don't care either.
honestly id really have liked to see the air compressor clean.
I bought two of these lightly used a few months after they had released. The price still was around retail so I took the chance. Sold one a few months later for what both costed me so I ended up with a free 500 million edition that I still use as my main PS4 to this day. It's really beautiful.
the hard driver will be not the problem at first because even when there is a hard drive problem, the  ps4 will show it on the screen.
Why no SSD? It makes games load so much quicker, and it is almost no more expensive as an HDD.
Looks Cheap 😅👌
Now that these disc rollers are nice and clean now buuuut I'td be a shame to go this far and not address the optical lens dirt accumulation lul
that alot of Friends
Tried to like the video like 4 times😂😂🎉
Wat if da ps4 has been hack
But the disc drive will not work with the doner motherboard.
This is a cool console but I think it's a bit over hyped. The whole translucent look when light up doesn't look all that good to me. It reminds me of someone creating a cheap looking console. I feel like a version like this on PS5 but better would be perfect.
My friend wants do some maintenance on his PS4 before it dies and I'm just hoping theres no bug infestation or anything crazy 💯
Man, someone was selling a complete in my area for like 400 bucks when PS4s weren't selling for much. I'm STILL kicking myself for not grabbing it when every fiber of my being told me to. Just couldn't swing the extra cash at the time.
sooooo who did you send the board to?
Just my 2 cents, if I was buying a LE game system, I would prefer as original as possible. So I would prefer the original HDD if it still worked. Nice resto, great video.
Love your videos but you def use TO much thermal paste lol <3
Commenting just to help the algorithm since you forked out extra purely because you wanted a copy of this edition
9:55 more like "i clean computers from bugs... literally"
great video! when you do another air compressed cleaning it would give everyone more asmr feels if we see the compressed air in action (we got a side view but not a view of the grill). The thing that gave me anxiety was seeing this PS4 and the one from the previous video so close to the edge that it might fall lol.
My cosin has a ps4 and the hard drive broke but it didnt get a blue light
Keeping plastic on your console is a damn good way to overheat it. I understand people want to try and preserve the console because of its “collectability”… but if you’re looking for a console to play on, it shouldn’t be this one!  Ps— who can live that way?? With so many roaches?? Jesus Christ. Throw that board into an ultrasonic cleaner!!!
Dam that PS4 looking like Joe’s Apartment 🤦‍♂️
Have you used CRC Electronic Component Cleaner? Ive used it before to clean up arcade boards works wonders for stuff like that.
I have that console
Face reveal
Nice work fixing the RoachStation mainboard!
fantastic
These cockroaches lived in a dream house 🤗
@tronicsfix- when you have bugs or dirt, why don’t you get in there w a vacuum (maybe w a brush attachment)? That would help keep your mat area and shop clean.
That is a Gorgeous console, i'd love to get one some day. 😅👍
TronicsFix: Oh yeah sorry about that my whiskey bottle fell over and got the box wet
Personally i would’ve tried to fix the original motherboard then the value of the unit would be much more
You wouldn’t be able to sell it as a genuine 50,000 Limited edition you would have to sell it as a 50,000 limited edition with standard re-placement PS4 motherboard. You wouldn’t Able to get the limited edition, money, type.😮
Bro, there is no perfect amount of thermal paste, you really should spread it everytime you change it. Otherwise the chip wont have a full connection with heat sink. Try mounting heat sink and then remove it, you will see spots without thermal paste.
Do you by chance happen to have any PS4 with firware 9.0?
I have no idea how, why, when, where, whatever conditions would lead a console assummed in use by someone, to become INFESTED with cockroaches. 🤢
I would love to have this ps4 😊
Hey I was wounding where you buy your broken ps4/ps5? I'm just getting started and don't normally buy stuff online. I just wounding trusted sites
Seriously that barracuda HDD is meh... you should try upgrading with a SSD. The load times are worth the upgrade in my opinion! Anyways good work!
Can u give away one of ps4 for me
This is the apu problem I think I can fix it
What bugging me is that you put a bug infested board in a nice clean well maintained system, hope it doesn't get software bugs again, man so many bugs. Fyi this message is from my bug friend, Spiderman, 🤣.
Please peel the film
How people can treat their electronics like this when you have damn nest of cockroaches in your PS4 pro. Damn.
😂😂😂😂😂😂
After jb 9.00 my PS4 idu option is enabled, but I don't know unfortunately my PS4 software is updated 9.60 my self, so please how to disable the idu option.
Hell yeah dude. I’m happy for you and was hoping it was gonna work for you haha. 🎉
When is there a new tronicsguide video
It is painful to hear all the crack sounds, but nothing was broken. Thanks.
Literally had to skip a giant chunk because of the bugs.
Love these videos. Amazing work.
How do people even get roaches into their console?
Man!! I fix consoles for hobby and you dont belive if I tell you that I just get a PS4 Yesterday with bug infested (very nasty thing)I wonder why this right video pops up into my YouTube selection 😂
Shocking how many ppl live w cockroach infestations! 😳
Super Putze
6:21, IMAGINE if he by mistakenly held a roach instead of a screw while putting them back..
for the love of god why is roach damage so common in playstations
Watching the video with your PS4 hanging off the table gave me some real anxiety lol.
maybe someone help me , i confused search the videos / googling but no one the treads discuss / have problems like me  yes , my ps4 get problem in the bd room , that case is rare , but i hope someone answer and help me to fix it  okey that case , while i put bluray , the bd room just spinning normaly , taking disc , reading disc normally , but few minutes the revving from the spinning bd room get problems like sometimes while revving at high rev suddenly the bd room get down to low rev and then to high and the low rev , and this case repeadtly , i check the bd room in the upper , and no one stuck / mechanism problems , i checking the optics read normally  just the bd room motor have error while revving , and the conclusion while the revving get error , the reading of the bluray disc having take a long time to read and didnt install any casette while casette have 10 gigs above , and sometimes the reading of casette have error
I'd love to see at the end of your videos, the q tip trash pile
An ozone machine may be a worthwhile investment if you get any number of these or processing them is worth it for you. It'll get rid of just about any smell.
I wanted to see you pull off all the plastic coating so bad
Found one of these awhile back but thought something was wrong because of the case 😂
cod3r
cockroaches on ur ps4
I would highly recommend doing any “dust” removal outdoors. With how disgusting some people’s homes are, you really don’t want to be breathing or ingesting in any way what could be trapped in those machines. Then again, you haven’t lived until you’ve heard your doctor use the term “fungal pneumonia” when discussing your test results 😷
I remember I was getting the blue light and started freaking out because I had done nothing to it, only to find out the hard drive was the reason, bought a monster hard drive and luckily I have been good since
Que gran video, gracias por compartir
Don't worry.  The 10.5 update will brick it....
Does it matter if its a 2.5 or 3.5 inch hard drive for a ps4 slim? I really want to upgrade my internal storage, because I already have an external hard drive but that is not enough. I also don't have space for another external hard drive because I don't have a USB port because I usually drive on my steering wheel
Do you resell what you fix? Where can I purchase one?
500mil limited edition, lol 😂, till now only 117mil got soled ps4pro, so how can call this limited??? 👀
Looks like drywall dust
That's really gross that has cockroaches but I don't know about a PS4 motherboard but  computer motherboard after they do nitrogen overclock they actually wash them in a dishwasher on low mild wash because you use Vaseline as a coating to keep the moisture off the board itself when doing nitrogen it is cooled as translucent downfall as a injection molding process technician the resume use I really don't like I think it's Polly permilla hide which is acrylic and after so long it will dry out old oil and barely touch it or bump it and it will break same stuff they use for your see-through plastic cups you buy as so best thing for that PS4 a clear case for it to sit in with fans for airflow
500 roach edition lol
This would've been hilarious if he accidentally put the wrong/Bad motherboard back in lol. Still though, great work man. I swear u guys make it look so easy and here I am still contemplating on taking apart my OG launch PS4 for maintenance.
I was asked to fix a commercial microwave i oped the cover and it was full of live cockroaches i left the place leaving it disassembled thats one Indian restaurant i wouldn’t eat at lol
Big man
Why would you want to see throw it? It is just a chunk of metalic ugly sheets. It is pointless. There is nothing to show in the interiors...
I cant believe that ps4 sold for more then retail and its broken. Mind Blown...
You paid 500 for a clear outer case. Is it rea;;y a limited edition with a new hard drive and mobo?
Yes because you would just wipe the real dead roaches onto the rest of the console while "trying to fix it" wouldnt you. Of course.🙄
Just a quick question, ive only heard or gotten the yellow light of death just wondering if theres a difference
Reminds me of my green or blue see through n64 me and my brother had as a kid he had thr ps2 and I had my 64 I loved those days go karts and video games !!!!!!! 90s only
What?! How the hell did the cockroach get into the HDMI port 😂
They left the plastic on, but apparently practiced their nunchucks on the front of the console.
Man... You said bug infested and I was imagining just numerous code issues... Was not expecting actual bugs!  I could only imagine what the owners home was like!! 🤢
Bros uncle Dane 💀💀💀
I can see you have no experience in fan cleaning. Use round paint brush about 2cm. Toothbrush is to stiff and to short.
I've ordered a brand new PS4 pro 500 million 3 days ago from Slovakia for 1.2k$, got it just for the sake of collecting.
I really hate cockroaches I may have some phobia to it or something but while repairing a xbox 360 I found it infested inside and I swear it was one of the worsts moments in my entire life.  Also DO NOT EVER open a second hand or console right in your home, if you buy it online open the package outside, in your garden or on your balcony somewhere you can easily spray insecticide and clean everything up fast as possible, you don't want that inside your home, you'll get really lucky if those mf are already dead
I still. Have my 500 million ps4 all accessories and two controllers I love that thing more than my ps5
You ever seen people who are just dirty ? You don’t know how or why but they are really rough in stuff and dirty and end up breaking stuff and not taking care of anything? That is where this ps4 came from
I’ve got two of these that haven’t even been open for sale if anyone wants them.
I wish you were in my area I’d pay whatever to have you take my console apart clean it and replace the hard drive the attention to detail is truest professional and I don’t trust most of the repair guys around her most definitely don’t trust myself
Started a couple weeks ago seeing your YouTube shorts, first full Video I’ve seen by you and loves it bro. Really cool. I just got a Series S , keep it up bro!!
Should add a lighting kit
14:33 That is way to much thermal paste all you need is a dot the size of a pea.
Dude gloves his hands, but not his lungs… Classic! Invest in some N95s my man!
Why didn't you put an SSD in it. Special edition deserves special attention.
It’s amazing to see how good he is at fixing and cleaning these things up!
People are disgusting pigs to live like that around filth. I don’t envy your job bro.
Cockroaches dont care what they live in -  one crawled into our fridge and caused a short which almost killed the fridge
I wanted this console so badly. I was all set up for the launch time with multiple pages open to order from and managed to order it from Curry's just before I had to go to work. They confirmed the order and I was over the moon and obviously closed all the other pages. I went to work buzzing that I'd manage to get one. So, I get home from work and I have an email from Curry's... "Order cancelled". NO YOU F***ING DIDN'T! 🤬 They had taken more orders than they had consoles. 😡 I was fuming and have never forgiven Curry's for this.  Anyway... gorgeous console. 😍😔
I started working at a recycling place and have been finding a lot of ps4s taken quite a few home now hoping to learn to fix them haha but it's honestly shocking how often they show up there
I have 48,000 and it kicks people out of helicopters in gta some how
Imagine being one of the people with the 1 or 50 millionth one, literally the biggest flex ever
I have a question for you. I ask as I see lots of your videos.  I took apart my PS4 to clean it. I also ended up replacing the internal fan.  After I got it all put back together. The only thing that changed is now my kids cannot use the mic to talk to other people. As a dad, that is a enhancement. At any rate, is there any way to fix that? Are you interested?
I have been watching your videos for about 2 hours now, I think I'm going to stop. Your videos are so entertaining.
Two words, my dude: Shop. Vac. Buy one. Live it, love it, USE IT.
Something to try, plug In the rgb cables the yellow white and red, with the included wire then turn it on, if the settings are set on rgb it will never show anything with hdmi plugged in
7:04 Yes, dump them into the ps4 instead of on the table..
Blue light of death wasn't really a thing. The red light of death on Xbox 360 was definitely a thing. In terms of more frequently happening that is.
Man I could never find one of these consuls, and I’ve always wanted one. I thought they look so cool they still do.
500 million and limited edition dont go together.
Where can I get one of those alcohol bottles? That is so nice.
Ix that the most you've ever paid for two pieces of plastic?
you should invest in an electric duster..save you alot of money in the long run instead of using air duster which has chemicals in it  also how come oyu didnt troubleshoot the other board first since it was in such good condition?
Seagate sucks! Had 3 hard drives from them and ALL fail within 4 years of normal use.  Still have some 10 years old WD
Do you  have a source for fixing one of the old school fat PS3's?  I think my issue was the secondary board in it.  A place I took it to years ago tried a reflow but it did not work.
1month later… so who did you send the motherboard too
send motherboard to the Rossman Group?
Why not ssd?
bug infested.. that actually not so bad... i bought one which is far more disgusting.. but its still working fine. and.. i managed to clean it.
i dont understand how can a person house have so many roaches? they stay in a garbage dump?
I have one of those with P.T. Installed in it. Am I holding something valuable?
if that had been mine, you would have got it in all piled up in a paper bag.
Is that 70% or 99% isopropyl alcohol?
Couldn't he used an Ultrasonic cleaner
maybe a stupid question 😅 butt you always seem to use like a toothbrush to clear out the dust, i like to use a paint brush because it's softer and longer than a toothbrush, easy to get in tide corners and one swipe does the trick, it seems a lot harder with a toothbrush, do you have a reason for this or something? i'm currious 😇  learned a lot on this channel, keep up the good work, nice content! Greetings from Holland!
I am a sucker for translucent game consoles
I think the board is going to "TheCod3r"
Dude! those consoles would be in a storage unit away from my house and taken apart someplace else to make sure I didn't get any German cockroaches like in that console in my house. I freaking HATE cockroaches.
I'm still happy with my golden taco bell PS4 😂
I saw one of these in Tokyo last year listed for $900- working but it was more than the used PS5 right next to it. I was like 😮😮😮
I think I damaged my PS4 pro from playing Skyrim and accidentally turning it off hardware issue?
My PS4 from 2017 still works but my New PS4 pro got blue light of death few months later... Woo
I dont understand. is APU so easy to break or damage? You get a lot of them lately.
I love this content, i could nerd out all day with stuff like this.  Thanks for the content, keep the videos coming.
I saw this PS4 since 3 years ago at Shoppee apps.Didnt know it was rare but the price was definitely pricey.
good vid,BUT why do people still use can air,when you can get a handheld comp that never runs out lol.
My PS4 Fat is working proper 3 an 4 hours playing games But problem is when I turn my console Blue light💡🔵 not working only white ⚪💡light what you say is this okay
Can you do , apu  reballing video . TronicsFix. 😬
I have a old ps4 pro that you can have
it hurts me that this console was used like that   it's in so bad condition
I have a question, my ps4 had a broken flat cable from mb to the cd drive. Now with a new firmware update it won't udate anymore as it can not detect the disk drive. Do you sell used flat cables or can I bypass the update? The hard drive is used for other purposes right now so I will need to install the entire OS again. What's the best solution for this?
Those scratches by the USB port tells me the owner doesn't take very good care of the console.
"7th rarest" doesn't sound that rare at all to me, how many ps4 pro variants are there? 9 ? lol
What kind of flux do you use and where do you get it?
Reminds me of when my room was infested with bed bugs, I found one going into my PS4's DVD slot, so took it apart to check and clean it, thankfully it was just the one bug...nothing like this.
Hey I have an Xbox elite controller with stick drift I was wondering you able to fix it for me ?  also I love your video
My local Sears had like 100 just sitting there a couple years ago
I actually have one almost 100% perfect !! Console never been opened has factory film on one side the top has light scuffs everything else is in perfect never used condition down to the ear piece my console is number 47,284/50,000
What's the best way to regularly clean blank plastic outer surfaces like these without scratching it? Both my PC case and various electronic devices get small scratches or residue over time with damp cloth, paper or wet wipes. Leaving them more matte and faded than they are supposed to be. Fine cloth for glasses seem to not pick up dust very well for large surfaces like these (cloth gets dirty and doesn't soak it up).
happy new bro....hope you had a good one...was missing your videos since december..at list i have a lot of them to watch...love you bro
Seems strange you say you've been looking for one for 4 years and they're everywhere on eBay
Quick question as soon as I plug my xbox one in it constantly turns it self off then back on on off off on off could this be a dirty fan or console
Your going to send it to Shane fix?
I wish they  sell through shell for PS4 slim
15:30 what a fantastic game! I loved Trials Fusion
I still have a first release Ps4 one of the first from the batch sold in USA and its going strong but sounds like a Jet lol.
just found this channel lol i have one that works and you could have just had it i never use it
Hey Tronics, can you make a video addressing the PS5  liquid metal spillage issue or non issue?
Yo can I have the motherboard 🙏
lol is iea tea ur father
Hey tronics, I can hear the noise the camera's zoom does, example at 6.26 on the zoom out. Right channel.
You sent it to Louis Rossmann didn’t you
When you clean/repair the consoles do you use some kind of ground mat/band to not destroy the components from static electricity? And is it necessary if im cleaning my consoles? Just asking so I don't break them and have to buy another  one.
dude a ps4 is not rare dude
If there are that many cockroaches inside the PS4 how many cockroaches were inside the house? Yuck
awesome shirt!
😘😘👌👌
your gunna send it to thecoder !!
I'm selling my PS4 is not working hdmi port and is in good condition 500GB space and 1TB external
Similar to your ps5 video my Xbox doesn’t read disc. It used to but traveling on deployment with it might have messed it up. Would that probably be it getting disconnected from the motherboard?
Salute Fam you are a miracle worker@@@
I have one still in box, un opened , sealed🫣
managed to buy the controller of a friend i want this console sooooooooo bad or they should make a ps5 version
are you able to fix my xbox series x
The roach'd board is definitely one of those cases where having an ultrasonic cleaner would be a huge boon.
I have a Nintendo switch that won’t hold a charge and no one in my network of people wants to even attempt to fix it. What should I do about it?!?!? I neeeeeed it back
I got a serious question about the Liquid Metal rumor for the ps5, doesn’t it have like a protective area, that’ll keep any Liquid Metal from seeping into the mother board even if it’s vertical position
The first thing I did when I got my pro was to install a 2TB Samsung ssd. It's a night and day difference.
Beautiful console man. I’ve been wanting one for years, one with an SSD would be amazing
I have one of those and I removed the protective plastic , I regret it later, Nyah 😢.
There German cockroaches there very nasty and hard to get rid of once you have them
Could someone please give me the link for that 2tb hard drive? I need one for my PS4 FAT.
Can I bought this from you ? Lol
Hello what camera do you use to show pcb boards ? And where can I get one Thank You
would you be interested in a 20th anniversary ps4?
It’s only the shell that is rare and collectible, swap the shell onto a working unit and job done.
Is there a class I can take to learn how to fix electronics like you
I don't mind case swaps. I did that to my destiny taken king PS4 when it got the blue light of death
TheCod3r is the YouTuber
That’s that cockroach “musk” you can smell! I can identify that musky roach scent as soon as i walk in an infestation 😂 makes you want to take a lunch yeah?
I have one of these still brand new, never opened. Always tempted to sell it, but here I am with it still just sitting in my closet - same with multiple other random special edition consoles over the past ~15 years. Nice pick-up!
500 mil limited edition.. LoL
Sony wants to know your location
Aahh..so this is the one that the other dude also gave up..he cpuldnt fix it too
Walmart has one for 1500 one in stock 😅
If only the ps4 could talk to you. It would probably say I can breathe no more roach smell
So you paid $500 for a clear blue case 🤔
I have that exact stand for my PS4 Pro, just in a smoke color. If you keep an eye on eBay they come up for $20-$30 brand new, and the insert you need would be in it. I’d bet a lot of money that you’d never see the smoke insert once it’s on the console!
Cool.
hey man i have a laptop when i plug it in it says its charging but its stuck at 2% i didnt know wherre t go and who to ask and i remembered u do u have any suggestions thank u i love ur vids also
I hesitated to buy this system when it was on sale, I regret it.
I have one of the 500 million controllers. one of my favorite actually. wished I was able to get the ps4 with it. but they made twice as many controllers as the consoles so they could sell the controllers as limited too
Wondering why you didn't install an ssd
Hearing blue light of death gives me ptsd
A toothbrush? Wth?
I love cross overs lol
Fingerprintsssss!!!!
Lmao when he said bug infested I immediately thought he meant viruses and what not
why would you pour the cockroach corpses off of the motherboard BACK into the case instead of into a trashbag?!?!?
My one shows the scratches, how do I buff them out
Burn the bugs
I have a pair of turtle beach stealth 700 that won't stay powered on unless it has an aux cord plugged in, I've read that this is a common problem and nobody was able to fix it, I was wondering do you have a video on it
**bug infestation** Me: "oh so like some malware or something?"  **100s of exoskeletons fall out of motherboard** Me: "oh..." 😂
i had a ps4 with delay didnt got it fixed
Thanks to the Cod3r for his repair attempt (Even though he definitely does not know how to apply the perfect amount of thermal paste! LOL). Check it out here and see if he could fix it! https://youtu.be/K1-re0bchew
:o
Do you fix Samsung one connect boxes for a U55HD9000
So Thecod3r got the faulty board
damn i should have bought one. didn't really think much about it at the time. there were a few sitting at my local Fred Meyers for weeks....
I have an idea, who you've sent the motherboard to. Hope it shows up on that channel in the foreseeable future. :)
There not rare at all
I recently cleaned a PS4 where the heat sync was even more thick with dust than that I'm surprised it didn't blow up
As a kid i always used to take apart all of my electronics because i was so enticed to see what was going on underneath. your videos really make me relive those times!
Really cool stuff first video I have seen by u and I am a subscriber now thumbs up
I feel like i have to mention that the disk drive from the old motherboard, while it might look like it's working, will actually not read disks at all, as the drive needs to be married to the motherboard. To actually make it work, you need to swap the daughterboard present on the blu-ray drive of the special edition ps4 with the one from the unit you took the motherboard out of.
That guy's deserves nothing in life for keeping that plastic protection on it.
I have playstation 3 turns on and everything juss the disc drive something wrong with it the games dont show upissing the toppart cover of the playstation can u fix minee please a conplete repair it would show for an awesome video to make miss my old playstation with the over 20 games i got and al my old saves😢😢😢
I know you probably wont read my comment but I have really good tip for you. I saw u used a toothbrush or something like that to clean the dust from the fan. I recently discovered that using one of those make-up brushes that women use to apply powder on their cheeks is probably the  best stuff there is. It gets everywhere pretty easily and is very effective. If you randomly read this comment consider trying it.
We in iran change the cpu apu and gpu
Pleas reapor some cellphones
Hi, what camera and tripod do you use to record your videos? Especially from the top view perspective.
To whom are you sending the MB ?
It aint rare. it's well done.
Hey Tronic's what's your take on the ps5 liquid metal debate?
The roach infested systems that confuse me the most are Xbox One S. I genuinely don't understand how they get inside of them as aside from the ports and vents which don't even give large enough access to the inside, there are no large openings. But somehow they get inside of them and when you get a roach infested one there's usually hundred/thousands in the tray at the bottom of the system.
I owned this PS4 and motherboard was fry, sold it over eBay for 400€
I really wanted one of these, but then I got my ps5 on launch day and I was probably luckier to have that 👍
I have a broken original ps4 pro. I'm thinking about some time this year sending it to you to try and fix. Not sure yet tho. I might try and make it a project for me to learn....
This was not the best video to watch during lunch...
"Hey honey, I cleaned out cockroaches but I got a bad ass PS4 pro to show for it!"  Your job is awesome and as always, appreciate the content!!!
so I have this first gen xbox elite controller and i was wondering if u could give it a look do a few fixes
if you don't already have it, you now need the 10m edition ps1 to match!
to sum up these videos over all these amazing years...I wouldn't say "they are broken" For TronicsFix they are mostly "Not working currently" IMO broken means "damaged" and "Not working currently" well...Tronics can fix anything, and its been a pleasure watching these over the years,bringing back life to amazing Electronics that people discard sometimes like Sunday Trash. Thanks for all the Wow's over the years!!!! P.S My name is Also Steve and that makes these videos that much better! Steve's hold it down!
This version of the console looks cheap to me. I still think my God Of War PS4 looks the best
Could it be another board sent to Cod3r? Or perhaps this one goes to computerbooter
What is a good internal hard drive for a PS4 slim? I've heard you mention one in particular I'm trying to look through your videos to find the brand because it's reliable.
My friend went to get one of these, he stopped to look at the games and noticed someone else buying one, when he went to the counter to ask for one he was told they just sold the last one, gutted
There should be PS camera v2 with a stand in the box for the 500M edition.
It is outrageous the amount of PlayStations with roaches in them, perhaps it’s my area & the demographic, but man about 2/5 of ps4 that come in for hdmi/psu/disc drive, have some degree of bug infestations. 🤢  As a fellow repair tech for like 10 years now, trying to break that stage fright and make exciting content soon, I have a few ideas I haven’t seen out there, I appreciate what you do shining light on the repair world.
Why don't you use an ultrasonic cleaner for your electronics with this gross of a mess? Or even liquid damage?
LOL!!! When you was telling what to tell your wife when you get home I just thought of how John wick would tell his wife that he killed a man with a book and a pencil
Hi, can you please make a video about a series s? thanks
You should look into an ultrasonic cleaner. Or you should make one for yourself. They work wonders. Just make sure you use the right medium.
Hi who did you send the motherboard to i would love to watch that video..
Now go find a PS4 (PS1 Paint Color Edition)
But where did you send the mobo?? 😊
I love how it's screaming as if everything is breaking while you take it apart. Am I alone in thinking it sounded way worse than normal?
Dang that ps4 is sexy
The tools you list are fantastic. Could you also list some budget tools that get the job done? I do want to repair my own devices but it seems excessive to spend nearly $3k just for the soldering station and hot air station. The products are great but to me don’t seem feasible for the average person looking to repair their stuff. No shade. Just a suggestion. I love your videos!
Why do you refer to this ps4 as a 500 mil edition if Sony only made 50k ?
will get one when they fix this problem
ps4 ps5 architecture flaw afther 2 years fans start  to scream even if you clean the fans
I guess it is time to try next level of restore, to start changing the faulty memory chips or even the faulty processor.
I need to find a metalized polypropylene film capacitor cbb21 105m250v do you know where I can get them
We need a return to consoles having funky cases like this, the translucent coloured plastic cases were peak 90s and there was something about them that just made them more fun to own
Guy speaks weirdly.
Great find, having the box and everything is awesome
I just got a ps5 and there is roaches where i stay should I box it back up and open when it’s bug free here
Ps5  lquid damage can because for vertical standing?, 3 repair Man says youtube.
Wait i have that
I love how unbothered you are to the roaches anyone who’s been in the repair industry just builds up an immunity the first few times I popped a pc open and seen them I shivered but after a while you just become numb 😂
FYI, swapping boards does not qualify as fixing. I don't know how you got so many viewers when you show nothing in your videos. Basically it's all click bait.
i would put a 1/2 tb ssd inside... they are also expensive now... Why arent you using a normal aircompressor ; yeah its a little bit loud, but it gets best results in a lesser amount of time; especially for those about isopropanol, but i wont use the brush an dust and stuff a compressor blows out.
green seagate decent? I do not think so. We do not put those in consoles/ntbs because they are faulty after a year and they are pretty slow. We use at least Blue Western Digital or Samsung EVO SSDs.
Talking about rare hope you fix a Fist Of The North Star PS3 sometime
Hi do you fix phones ?  Got a s20 ultra,,,needs a new screen  Can you help ?
Love that, didnt know about the special edition.  You should get an ultrasonic cleaner for the motherboards.
There should be something linking the MB to the Case for special editions, usually like the MB having special code showing “special edition” if I remember correctly, with the number matching the case number.
Didn't even know this was a thing and now I'm jealous. I've always like transparent electronics, especially blue or black.
You said 500,000,000 edition a few hundred times when it's the 500,000th edition...  It killed my OCD.
Working ones are that much. And there are a few $450 that work but I guess you made that much from this video.
These things are damn bug magnets unfortunately. They FLOCK to the inside of these ps4s for some damn reason.
Good job bud
You should invest in a sonic cleaner. Roaches are gross.
I don't think "500 million" constitutes a "limited edition." (500 maybe, but not 500 million)
How do people allow their systems to get so dirty?  Just a little bit of compressed air a few time a month will help with that!  Also the systems with the roaches just imagine what their house is like if their system gets infested!  You can get an exterminator pretty reasonably and if it's an apartment someone probably has a really nasty apatment and here in Texas there are laws on that and they can make that person clean it up and solve the roach problem!
Top markotop
Why not buy a 2tb SSD drive? It improves load times and is great paired with the ps4 pro. It’s what I did for my ps4 and worked
So who did he send the MB to? I wanna see if it can be fixed but Idk who he's sending it to....
Broken stand? :(
Hey. love watching your videos, would like to see more old school stuff like cassette recorder, DVD player etc!
Never seen that one before
Best option to keep roaches out put stick traps all around it and replace them daily
If you ever see a rare console out there better snatch it pretty quickly and I don't care about the price if I have the money I'm getting it . I don't know but I think Sony has either  1 or 50,000 usually they keep either the first or last of the rare models
SeaGate????? 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
What does the thermal paste do?
Who's the youtuber you sent the pc to?
Is the broken one more rare than the unbroken one?
Roaches will also kill PC power supplies. Wrapping window screen around the PSU stops roaches while allowing airflow. My relative was having to replace their PSU about ever six months, after wrapping their new PSU with window screen its lasted about two years.
They can afford a ps4 pro but doesnt bother with some bug killer products LOL
i would love to learn how to fix things for a living but i don’t have the money to pay for a class or classes
I wish you could fix my 2ds XL because I dropped it and the screens broke and Nintendo said they can't fix it because it is to old
I miss see-through stuff. Everything was see-through when I was a kid and I loved it all.
That 500M edition probably died because they didn’t peel it, keeping a bunch of that heat in.
does Gamers/buyers make console so dirty or when they sell, and it gets dirty by roaches in time?
Seagates the worst come on everyone knows that!!
I wonder if the Motherboard goes to The Cod3r.
I had a bug infested house before and had opened my PlayStation to replace the disc reader and there where no bugs
Do you have site for buying?
That was enjoyable
Had someone told me a couple of years ago that I would be following a couple of guys on the tube doing board level repairs on electronics I would have laughed in their face. Yet here we are.  I understand the yuck factor but kinda laugh a little when you pull out the gloves, I worked on locomotives for a living and never wore gloves, not understating your desire to remain yuck free it is just amusing to me... lol.  Another great video of course and your production, scripting, conceptualization, editing and content are phenomenal and on point Steve, bravo!
What a beautiful system! I'm glad I live somewhere where there isn't roaches 😂
I have mine brand new! But, unfortunately is not for sale! 😢
I would suggest a good ultra sonic cleaner to clean boards like that. It works great.
Do you not test boltage on chips, fuses,ect? Thecoder dose all that and changes parts to make the board work.
Have my 500 million headset still going strong, something special about clear colored plastic
Could u do a xbox modification into a see through xbox case ?
Hello. I am interested and trying to get more into small electronic repairs and was wondering if you had any tips on what to do to get started! What to expect? And how I can turn this cool hobby into a side gig! Love your videos and all the information packed into them! Thanks!
I actually bought a ps4 today for $60,they said it didn’t work so I was going to disassemble it like you do and try to fix it. But I plugged it in and didn’t display anything at first so I move the hdmi cord and it actually works.I guess I won’t be playing on my Xbox 360 anytime soon.
I would be pissed knowing this is the history of my special edition whatever *insert name*
😊👍
I have a GoW edition Pro (which I still have) and tried to buy one of these when it came out too…but was not able to. Now I mostly use the PS5 though. It’s cool that this limited edition console was actually used and that you brought it back to life with a thorough cleaning…and put the perfect amount of thermal paste! 😂
You are great and I love watching you but why oh lord put the cockroachy board into that beautiful angelic god machine?? 😭 It's just wrong! But if you left the roaches on there you could have watched them running round like a cockroach terrarium lol 🤢
Wow I never even knew these PS4 consoles released! That looks awesome!
Just wondering, why dont you use a real air compressor that can be reused instead of the disposable air cans? Also there is a lot more power (adjustable) which makes the cleaning process much easier.
Kinda ugly tbh but cool video
I was wondering which digital microscope you use...or which you recommend? I've been looking at getting one and yours looks to produce a great image! I don't fix electronics for profit, I just fix stuff for family and friends...so I'm looking at something reasonably priced. Hope to hear back from you. I love the videos. They've helped me out a ton in fixing things. They are also therapeutic...rewarding in a way to see you get something working again. Thanks for all of the videos!
Engaging so you get your $500+ back lol
who the youtuber that fix motherboard\
why didnt you fix mobo instead replacing whole thing? what kind of repair shop are you, if you just exchange parts? xD
I got one of them still use it, got the box and all the accessories with it aswell
That's a great steal! Definitely would love to see some special edition xbox consoles as well
only in america
So... you've basically just cleaned and replaced? Where exactly is the fix? I really wish you would try more solutions to fix these electronic parts. Every time I watch one some of your videos, it feels like it is ending unfinished. I rarely see in your videos all the solutions to try fixing them and more than that, this one seems like a misleading video title.
Great content!. why don't you have an air compressor? to blow all the dust out?
First of all... I rly like your content, dude! But isn't the disc drive married to the motherboard? Greetings from austria 🤘
You have a job where you get to see how nasty people are
The roach Hotel got one hell of an upgrade 😂 Great video as always Steve 👍
You'll be sending it to the Cod3r?
500 Million Cockroach edition. Now THAT'S rare!
People living with roaches are gross
Hey. Can you help? I've got a PS4 Pro and recently bought a game that vibrates really noisily in the optical drive but reads fine. I've then noticed other games disks make a noise, not as bad but it's constant rather than when the disk is reading. Any ideas? All disks read fine just very noisy. Thanks.
The Cod3r
Mymatevince is the one you sent it to
I initially thought it was the grey 20th anniversary edition but I had forgot about this one
Hi TronicsFix. I did the same thing to my limited Edition PlayStation and switch the motherboard last year. But I came up with a problem like yours. How do I install the soft drive to the hard drive for the PS4?? Or use the hard drive from the other PS4 where I have taken the motherboard from?? Need your help.
I love the idea of giving stuff you can't fix to other tech repair channels, would love to see more of it!  Maybe even them sending stuff they can't fix to you? Could be a nice wee series, even if it was a monthly or even yearly thing.
There’s a few ps4 limited editions I want lol the god of war one the dragon quest one with the little slime character the 20th anniversary one I also really like the destiny edition one I want all of them but my wife would be mad lol oh I like the metal gear solid one too!
they only made 500 million? very limited
Couldnt have been looking to hard... I see these all the time on ebay..
I remember those selling out so fast! For me though, as nice as those are ive always wanted the 20th anniversary ps4
The ps4 retro ps1 edition was very cool very hard to get at the time, and  it was really expensive. I'm going to check and see if there's any videos about that console and see wat they are worth now. It's the 20th anniversary ps4 I was thinking about and it's the most expensive ps4 ever according to Google
right how the f do you get bugs in your console
What do you say about PS5 spills liquid metal positioned on vertical, have you seen that before?
Hey, Germany here. Why are there Bugs in this console?? I never see that before. How is this posible? What looks like the apartment where the the consol is from??
I once found two standard PS4s sitting on a pile of trash on the side of the road. The owner told me that they are old and dirty so he got rid of them. I took them and cleaned them completely and found out that one is firmware version 1 and one version 5. And I even got a third one I bought as broken after someone "broke" it after cleaning. It turned out he damaged the drive cable and didn't connect the small additional PSU cable resulting in the PS4 not turning on. So now I have three custom firmware friendly PS4 which all work (one has a broken power button I don't know how to repair as it is a board issue with the touch button. I soldered a small button on a cable onto the pads inside the DVD drive that turn the console on as a temporary fix. But I have to put some time in later).
This is so relaxing to watch
Which youtuber did he send it to?????
See through consoles are my favorites. I wish I could buy the Nintendo 64 when they released
First video I did't like
I have no idea what happened to my PS4... Went to turn it on one day it started then immediately turned back off, it's not worked since.. sad as I still have it sat collecting dust.
Don't these exclusives have something imprinted on their motherboard ? And why you still haven't started working with faulty cpu and bridge bga chips for so many years??? It's not that hard
sweet fix there
@thecod3r would give this a goood go :)
Hard drive? In 2023? Go with an SSD they make such a difference. Even more so in a ps4 pro than a ps4.  yeesh. Awesome work though :D  Also you gonna send that to TheCod3r?
If you have one, you could just use a dishwasher with regular dishwasher tabs to clean the motherboard. After that you just have to rinse the board with distilled water. It works very well
Looks like a $500million bucks
Do you sell the things you fix?
Hello Steve. Can i ask you where to buy screws for the Ps4 Slim motherboard metal plate? i think they are the same on the Ps4 Pro motherboard ( min 11:22 )
Been watching Steve for ages and just now realised he looks like Sheldon from that one big bang theory episode where they all grew beards😅 Amazing repair as usual
11:14 a few weeks ago I was taking apart a ps4 and I remeber that I couldn't for the all the power in the world (without risking to break something) take out that power cable so I eneded up just working around it. Come today to this video where I was left comepletely dumbfounded when I saw you pull it out in less than 2 seconds.
hey quick question since you seem to know what youre doing. i got a standard ps4 that keeps overheating. ive tried everything from cleaning to replacing the thermal paste. i even drilled holes into the case where the fan is which helped just barely enough to prevent overheating. now the last thing i read and havent tried was to initialise and therefore wiping the ps4. is that something that could actually work? i can take losing all my saves but i dont wanna do it unless i know exactly that it will help...
Coolest Limited edition! Controller looks strange to me as no sticker with info on the back side. There should be sticker with sony info. Congrats!
PS4 Pro Squished Cockroach Edition.... Ugh. Glad I live in a place where cockroaches are hard to come by.
00:31 you mean the bottle of isopropyl alcohol you keep your vodka in! 😂
If you’re gonna replace the HDD might as well put an SSD in it.
I still have mine. Still working since 2018.
My ps4 stopped working right around when this console was released and with little hesitation, I bought the console, extra controller, and headset at around midnight. Although I figured out the issue with my broken ps4 and replaced the hard drive fixing the problem. I still have the console and accessories unopened and more unlikely now that I have a ps5.
When you said bug infested I thought you meant it had been hacked. Doh.
This might be out of place, My PS5 is gathering dust inside what is the best way to clean it ?
"Perfect amount of thermal paste" *proceedes to hack a hairball size glob on the cpu
I wanted him to peel the plastic off the surface sooooo bad lol
Hey steve im a one of ur biggest fans I learned the best from you and i had a question is it true about the rumors of standing you’re ps5 vertically could the Liquid Metal leak????
Ill subscribe if u give us ur ebay user  I want to see if u sell some ps 4 s 😩
I never heard of this one before lol. I have the GoW edition Pro. Sold it for a pretty penny as well.
didnt know this existed, awesome console
Roaches also like small spaces. They seek out places where they can feel solid surfaces on more than one side, like between a motherboard and a back cover.  Roaches are also attracted to the electromagnetic field that surrounds power wiring and especially transformers, coils, inductors, etc.  And they also like the free warmth.  So all together, they find electronic devices absolutely irresistible.  As for WHY they are so common, roaches have thrived alongside people for centuries.  People are messy, leave food out, don't clean, and they live in places where other people have the same habits. Even if YOUR apartment is spotless, chances are at least some of your neighbors have a roach paradise and those roaches are inside your walls as well.  It is just a fact of life.
500 million is rare? - thats like every single US American having one (toddler to ancient) + tens of millions so spare.  it was was 50 million, i could agree that it is somewhat rare. But my idea of rare actually ends at maybe 1000  edit: oh - or do you mean limited edition for the 500 million sold units past?
Weird YouTube recommended but good video 👍
my pc came with an unwanted broken graphics card rip
Make sure to keep the original board with the 500mill as it adds value 👍
I actually have one of these but for whatever reason I never got like it. I love my PS3 way more than this thing 😅
Please a video about ps5 new issue "leaking liquid metal on the console."
Hello I love 💕 how you refurbish consoles and your attention to detail. I'm wondering how I can purchase a refurbished console from you? I would buy a used console from you over any GameStop or best buy!!! Please let me know how I can buy from you and what you have in stock. Thank you. KJ-CJ
I had two of the 20th Anniversary PS4s at one point. Never opened them, so I don't know what numbers they were.
I wanted one of these so bad... lol
Nice saving that ps4 limited edition. But you forgot to clean the controller, Steve.
Just straight human skin lol
7th rarest? So what’s the first one then…
If it flashes blue, it's a boy, if it flashes Red it's a Xbox
Isnt time that you invest in a ultra sonic cleaner?
Where can you buy that canister which is holding the isopropyl alcohol?
The 500milloin edtion costs almost 2k here
I bet he smashed the ps4 and will refix it lollll
I actually just got my hands on a Death Stranding Edition PS4 Pro. I was lucky enough to find it for a great price ($350) and it came in like new condition with everything included. It didn't even have dust inside it, I was super impressed and a bit shocked.
Hey Steve, how about using an Air Duster?
You seem pretty good at fixing stuff, could you fix my marriage?
Not everything is "amazing."
Man I've been trying to get my hands on just the controller to go with my original colour scheme one and Darth Vader one
Man I wish this content existed back in the day. Ps3 yellow light oven videos are stone age material at this point
Can you pls talk about the issue when you put the ps5 vertically it can cause serious damage on the ps5 because of liquid metal leaking
Are you sending it to the coder?
People will blow 3-$400 for a console but not an exterminator💀
How do you know you won't have live roaches in one? Would suck to get an infestation due go that
Insect debris and other organic waste isn't too bad to clean up. I've used 90% isopropyl alcohol and a sonic bath to clean those up fairly well and sanitize them, but I absolutely refuse to repair any electronics with tobacco tar and such debris. Bugs are an easy fix. Tobacco tar is just flat out disgusting and toxic.
Hey TronicsFix, late question here, will you address the PS5 Liquid Metal Spillage Issue that is exploding rn on the Internet? Great video btw as well!
That one and the ps1. Version so hard to find at a good price
So I would like to ask something...  I have been trying to clean out my 'recently' obtained(got it near Christmas a while back, not christmas 2022) and I was trying to remove the CPU fan... and the connector and a small part of the motherboard came off. I think nothing too important like any of the traces weren't broken, but the cpu fan has no power. Any suggestions about how to fix that?
Hi Steve, Requesting a Mechanical Keyboard and a Gaming Mouse video!  I think there are a ton a people who'd be interested, and I hate to see so many broken devices go to waste, give them the tronicsfix treatment!  Great content as ever btw.
Anything can be fixed it’s just we’re does the power stop I could even fix it.
I've been hearing that all version of the ps5 current are suffering from a design flaw and if u use it vertically, it may end up bricking your device. Has anyone ran into this issue yet? Repair shops have also stated this, should I start laying down my ps5 horizontally?
I think you'll send it to the guy in the UK. I'm drawing a blank on his channel name. Edit: the cod3r
I worked at a Gamestop warehouse when we shipped these out. I was able to purchase one. I still have it sealed in the vendor box :)
just curious, but have you ever thought about caving in to purchase those electric air blaster to replace those canned air?
dude I never seen so many roaches in a ps4... dude thats one dirty house
be careful, a guy got a shellfish allergy after being exposed to cocroach remnants. nearly killed him, and all he did was inhale. he also wasn't weakened before hand like so many people are these days. (auto immune related problems).
With the amount of work you do im surprised you use canned air. Get a compressor they are cheap.
I can’t imagine how filthy your house must be to get cockroaches in your console. That’s disgusting.
Fixed?
Worst case scenario could you switch the guts out keep the casing? Are those hard drives hybrids?
I dread the day I’ll have to disassemble my PS4 pro and my PS5. I just LOVE my PlayStation’s! I keep them both dusted and use compressed air regularly.
Hey could you talk about the liquid metal problem or if it really is a problem?
If anything, just removing the hard drive would be enough to make the console boot into safe mode.  No need to completely replace it if you just want to test quickly... at least in my experience.
There's nothing really special about this version
I was really hoping you'd peel off the plastic
Please wear a mask while cleaning nasty consoles.  Love your videos.
Why dont u use air compresor, this air in a can is not Earth freandly
It's probably Rossman, I bet it is
Buy an air compressor my man, those cans add up..
That controller is beautiful, it looks like expensive candy 😍  When managing unknown devices, please use gloves! 😢  even if it is 50 or even 100 dollars more than you would've paid for it, it's still worth it 'cause it's a commemorative edition: they're unique pieces, each of them  Glad to see it worked in the end 🥰
you're gonna send it to @TheCod3r
My first ever youtube comment (i think). I have an original 60gb backwards compatible PS3 if you fancy a shot at fixing that?
You skipped the part where you swap over the Bluray drive from the donor as well, or the controller board if the donor drive is also roach-infested. You can't just swap the mainboard as this video seems to suggest. You even commented this yourself on an old ifixit video!
Be glad u have that job man. I work at a rest area 😪. I would rather clean roach poop honestly haha.
i bet your gonna send it to My Mate Vince
i also really wanted one but could never find one
Wow you fixed this! Incredible. You should try fixing my marriage. Becky took the kids last week..
is it going to Rossmann?
I had one of those. Sold it when I got my ps5 back in 2020. Mine was number 45k or something like that.
No thanks to that replacement board
I love your videos I feel like I can repair mine when it’s time because of your information
tolti osam
Have a old console area for the website
Nooooot sure if I consider that a fix, but cool console regardless.  Guarantee @TheCod3r will fix that MoBo...
Worth it. Thanks for taking the time to try and find one. Great vid
Why wouldn't you switch components with your best ps4 pro. Weird man
Where can I get really good potentiometers at?
how much you want for that ps4 tronics
my mate has one of these he won it.... 1 of 50,000 made...... jammy git
Leaving the peel on killed it from the heat
i am convinced that thermal paste is steve's life blood
good stuff man!
I have a PS4 that needs a new motherboard. No matter what won’t turn on. Would you be willing to either buy or repair? We can work out details if you wanna hit me up.
There's only one i know of capable of this fix and that's the main man himself Mr Cod3r :)
I worked at Microcenter back when the Apple //c was still popular. We had a guy bring in his "Roach Mobil Home", for the free mother board upgrade because all you had to claim was you got a faster modem and the original motherboard could not support those serial speeds. It was INFESTED!!!!! Rod hit one with freeze spray and ..... well they did have to have the shop treated for roaches, cause they did not like that blast of cold!!!   more to story but you get the idea. Thanks for the memory, and a chance to tell the story again.
To whom are you sending the motherboard??  I would like to see the fix of the motherboard
I have a day one launch ps4. It’s been ran since that day, hard. Never cleaned once. Watching your content makes me wonder what it would look like if you went through it and cleaned it. It’s still working perfectly fine too. My friends went through several ps4 systems but mine never failed me.
i would like to see what was wrong with the old board but idk who is the YTber that will get the mobo
500 million "limited" edt. lmfao
Such a cool looking console! One I'd like to get, but still a bit high for me at the moment.
Great video!
I have one and it is my prized possession of my gaming collection! Love it
Need the opposite?  Send me working consoles and I'll break them in creative ways for you so you can fix them.
What would a new unopened one be worth these days?
I really felt the excitement that you are feeling while repairing this limited edition ps4. I hope you can keep it in a transparent box. 😅
i reckon you sent it to  TheCod3r to repair
I bought one of these locally complete in box with extra 500 Million edition controller for like $450 I believe.  The guy was in a bad place and needed money badly, I felt terrible he had to sell it but I got a good deal love the box love the console! I dont recall what number mine is.
Thoughts on using the rechargeable air dusters? I have one and it's decent. But I do find that it does take a little more effort and time.  Enjoy your content!! Watching your stuff has given me more confidence to do the more minor things to my pro.
Who's the other youtuber?
Thats a badass ps4
If you can afford a PS4 you can afford an exterminator
you certainly roached your way through that one
I have one for sale in Sweden.  Works perfectly flawlessly.
Hey man, I’m sure you heard of the Ps5’s seeping liquid metal issue. Do you think if Sony doesn’t offer a recall then it could be fixed with a slightly thicker seal around the apu to stop a leakage? I’d love to hear your opinion? Thanks
can you please stop touching the dead roaches man?
Did you send the board to TheCod3r?
The perfect amount of chitin paste
Hello :D Some months ago I watched some videos on replacing mobile phone batteries and it worked. I thought myself maybe I can repair my DS lite topscreen, but I hesitated. After watching your channel and a lot of your repair videos I was encouraged to follow my curiosity and bought some stuff. The only thing left is making a bigger order in Ifixit to get some special tools and replacement parts. :D  Now I have a question...is there something I can do for you (recommendation code or something) on Ifixit, so that they can see that you contributed on getting them a new customer? xD
Hi Steve I need ur help please read this I need help I was playing on my Xbox And I turned it off and tried to turn off my monitor and it fell Now there is a Crack please help I Have emailed you
Sometimes the HDMI can cause the BLoD. On my PS5 when I did not plug in the HDMi cable correctly, it kept blinking blue. So it might not have been the MB
We need more movies of cockroaches edition ps4 😂😂😂
Awesome stuff, really enjoyed this episode!
Love the video’s but the SFX when zooming are not my favorite and they are not the perfect amount of SFX ;-)
Would love to see you try fixing a BLOD PS4.  It does not have to be a sucess video just to see you try if it works Great if it does not still Great..
lmao @ bottle of alcohol...then ensures he corrects his comment...You still need to invest in a sonic cleaner ;)
can you show us your shop?
I had one of these before sold it and used that money to buy a ps4 but I really regret selling it 😫
Why are you using hard drives at all professionally kioxia 500gb are cheaper, better and last longer.
Amazing work, hopefully one day we see you bought all the equipment needed to fix this kind of problems.
now im worried.. I glanced at my ps4 like 20 times while watching this vid.. man this creeped me out
Send to the 8 bit guy 😂
someone who can afford a 500 dollar PS cant afford 30 dollars for pest treatment, WTF.
does sonic cleaning a board remove the roach smell?
Thecode3r😉😉😉
that edition is so cool
İlove you ifix
Need fix the Xbox one
Awesome video bro! You just got a new subscriber
Wouldn't cleaning bug infested parts in a ultrasonic cleaner be a better option?
**ALGORITHM**
Wish you could have fixed the original motherboard instead of swapping it now it's just the shell that's original
The perfect amount of thermal paste, now with sparkles AND god-like humming music!?
I love your videos and admire your skills.  However, I can't understand why you clean parts of the diskdrive right above the lens you've just cleaned. Why take the risk of small particles falling onto the lens?
This is my first video from you from a YouTube suggestions, great video man, i think i'll stick around :)
The question is not why they are in the console, question is why are they in the homes? Never had cockroaches in my house. Would be really disgusting.
I just dont understand the "special" part of the special edition. It's got a see through case with a blue color. Is that it?
Over to you TheCod3r!
I'm guessing you're shipping that motherboard to TheCod3r.
Nothing beats a NCS style song with a dental tool pickin Roach bits....Internet Nirvana
Freaking bugstations Health issues breathing in 🪳 pieces the smell u can get rid of with ozone machine when we refurbish them if too far gone they resold them to scrappers 😂
“Fixing” is not a proper word for replacing dead mother board by working one, i suppose.
Is it TheCod3r?
I was trying to repair a robot vacuum for a friend and it was full of fly worms. Some were still alive 🤢
I keep all my systems on a wire rack shelving. Not that I have roaches or anything.
5:47 it reminds me of one time when i was fixing customer's PC with burned PSU. When I opened it was full of cockroaches. They were dead and soldered to 220V power lines in PSU. They made short circuit 😁
If I had to guess, I would say you're going to send it to TheCod3r
I find that q-tips are helpful for those types of fans, brushes can't really get down in there.
Nice Nice
Its a ps4 bug edition 😁
Jealous
I wanted to watch this to breakfast
My ps4 pro has a blue light of death  caused by a faulty harddrive . If the ps4 was put in sleep mode , it would come to blue light of death and had to reinstall the software. I put in a ps3 500gb and now it work fine.
I bought the 20th Anniversary PS4 and couldn't justify buying this one as well. Really would have liked to get ahold of one. 20th A is still sealed in box though.
I'm guessing you're going to send the broken MB to "TheCod3r".
Me: Hey Fix, wanna go out and get some alcohol?  TronicsFix: Sure, I love Office Depot.
When you were popping that case off, those cracking noises had me so nervous
It’s not repaired though It won’t install firmware because it’s paired to the bug instead Blu-ray’s drive
Oh, who did you end up sending the broken mobo to if I may ask?
Best looking ps4 pro and glad you now got one and it's working after a swap and right amount of new better thermal paste. suck that the stand holder is damaged.
Changing the board is not fixing. Repairing the broken component is fixing.
can you please comment or make a video about the huge ps5 news!! (vertical and liquid metal)
Would be great if you could get the original motherboard fixed and put back, I know it is the same, but it would be more "original" in my opinion
Perfect scenario for an ultrasonic clean job. Nice video Steve. Love that edition Pro!
Hey Steve can I get a ps4 original motherboard? And how much will it cost me?
great work
I saw a broken one on ebay the other day
pls help, my ps5 keeps turning off when im in the middle of a game, I dont know but it might be a power supply problem.I was 30 mins into NFS unbound and it just turned off, and same with fortnite,but with fs22,I had no problems.
I remember seeing about 3 of these being traded in back when I was still at GameStop 😅 of course it didn’t happen at the same time
clear console only good for either OG GameBoy or N64
Some people though. Just imagine owning a ps4 pro (inaccessible) for many people and some people just hey i live in a trash bin what could spice that up? Oh i know a 400 dollar console.
What the hell! Who'd you send it to?... I'll forget about that MB in a couple minutes, not cool
Wait.... so we/you paid almost $600 just for a case ? !!!   Send the board to @TheCod3r ,  for sure he will fix it. @Tronicsfix
Did you send that board to Andrew Paul?
cool video...thank you
You really need an ultra sonic cleaner!
I always enjoy your videos! It's great to see you know what you're doing, and that you're able to fix what would usually be things thrown away, or just kept in a junk storage. That even though the job can be gross from time-to-time, it's worth watching you work, and the end results are usually always successful. I'm sure fixing something like this one is always satisfactory.
They have a few on eBay and in working condition
0:32 Trust me Tronics I don't think we thought any different
@Tronicsfix The only way I found to remove roach funk / cat urine from electronics is to use an ultra sonic cleaner and just submerge the boards.  Same for the plastic shells, but just let those soak in a tub of hot soapy water.  Even if you scrub the boards with rubbing alcohol,  once it's reassembled and the unit starts to heat up, it'll turn into the Glades plug-in from hell!  I do not miss that part of the used games industry!
What YouTuber did it go to?
I just had the blod issue after replacing the retimer chip and was able to put it into safe mode and save it. Why not try safe mode first before replacing the hard drive? Or replacing retimer first, then try safe mode?
Really digging the new zoom sound
The cleaner, more rare PS4 broken. Can’t fix the motherboard. The filthy, disgusting roach infested one? Works great!   Weird how the better more valuable variant has to borrow from the inferior version
My PS4 Pro has so many symptoms I don't even know what to do anymore. Does both the blue and white lights of death lol - White light on gets to account screen then click on account and screen says no signal - Other times goes past that to main menu for a while then looses signal. Makes me think hdmi port is ok. Looks fine no bent/missing pins... I have to always unplug to start over.  - Sometimes while rebooting it gets stuck on BLD. Hard reset to safe mode then 50 - 50 chance it will be white again... Anyone has a clue on what could it be?  My PS4 Pro is the limited edition "Dad of Boy" edition btw
I've seen some collectors sell this somewhere around 2 - 3 thousands dollars for a bnib.
After watching this... I can only imagine how much cat hair is in my Xbox Series X lol
An air compressor would do you wonders! like compressed air but unlimited and more powerful, you will want to have a dryer on it though so you don't mist the electronics.
I managed to find one on FB Marketplace and paid $350, and drove 100 miles to pic it up.
I dont feel like using my ps4pro500 after all the dust that you Brushed off. Can I just run a blower through it?
Really enjoy you videos. Lol at telling your wife. Keep it up!
Why didn’t the owner just return it for replacement by Sony under warranty??
Obviously the Cod3r is getting the spoilt motherboard.  Steve just had to install a Roach infested motherboard to an ultra rare 500-million edition, lol.
The almighty 500 million edition. It's beautiful
Was it able to go in safe mode ? If so try rebuilding tge database and installing the update file.
Its TheCod3r
Hi Steve can you tell us where did you send the motherboard to fix so we can all watch how can he fix please you are the best in YouTube
I bought a PS4 Slim back in July 2018. The regret of not knowing about, and not trying to hold out another month for this 500 mil edition PS4 Pro still hurts me to this day.
A nice end result.  That PS4 is definitely a keeper!
Does it have theme in software
The PS4 Pro disc drive isn’t married to the motherboard like the PS3’s was?
Hi Steve, love your videos and always appreciate the thorough cleanings. Would you try ultrasonic cleaners for a hands off cleaning approach? I ve seen them used in retro computer restoration.
Wait, so you had a roach-infested PS4 just hanging around?? I'm actually a bit saddened you put that gross board in such a nice console, even if it was scrubbed. :/
If Steve can't or doesn't care to fix it TheCod3r will probably do it just fine?
Definitely going to UK.  @Thecod3r is good with motherboards
The only thing wrong with mine is that the heat warped the bottom surface and there's like a small spider from one of the motherboard holders near the center luckily I changed the thermal paste and cleaned the heat sink of dust before it did any more damage It's unnoticeable for the most part, I love this thing.
I was able to get the 20th edition one only 12500 made. It's was ps1 gray with all the symbols stamped in it. I sold it sadly, helped pay for my dream car tho.
13:39 I slowed the playback speed to 0.5x and zoomed in...very satisfying
Gonna fix mine after u made me break it on ur disassembly video
Nicely done man 👍🏾
I like how he is going to send the board to another guy to have a go,So many people won't do that.
Your videos make me paranoid about roaches being in my ps4... I'd take mine apart to check but I think I'd rather just not know...
whos the board going to??????  maybe cod3r???? im sure we'll soon find out.
This dude looks like the cartoon version of mr.bean
It reminds me of the special edition ps2
Is this the board  you sent to "TheCod3r"????
Curious why would you not clean off and test the board before putting it into the other one? Could you not rig up a quick power supplier to give the board direct power to test it? Is that even a thing or do I not know what I'm talking about? If not I won't be offended I promise that's the usual reason I'm wrong pretty much most the time.
"no one does crystal consoles anymore der der" sony: hold my sake
New here love the videos so far 😁💪🏾
isn't the BD Drive married to motheboard? shouldn't changing that basically stop it from working unless you change the board on the Drive itself or was that removed on PS4?
6:29 if you find it disgusting, don't try to take a look at how kitchens look like here in Asia.
16:02 this is so fun, seen it before. unfortunately many units is donated to landfill.
I don't think I'd be able to resist peeling that plastic off!
I would love to do the things you do on your videos for a living. Or something similar, I just love wires, chips, and general electronics. Do you think electrician trade would be possibly satisfying? Or what should I look into? Your (TronicsFix) or anyone’s opinion would be greatly appreciated.
it's so weird to see bugs in electronics. it doesn't really happen in here since we don't have cockroaches anymore really and basic hygiene is pretty ok. honestly didn't know that the problem even exists before this channel although I knew some ants might cause shorts since they seem to like those places.
I don’t understand the obsession with these things.
Did the original hdd work in the PS4?
You keep saying 500 million edition lol
Love your channel. How did you learn to do all of this? because I would like to learn.
Happy new year Steve! Hope that whoever that other YouTuber is can fix it.
💥👍🏾👍🏾
Parabéns pelo seu vídeos eu adoro eletrônica cada  vídeo um aprendizado parabéns muito show
Looked like the controller barcode sticker was missing
$592 for a non functional console is outrageous.
Ha you wouldnt belive the stuff i found inside disk drives, once i found a 10$ target giftcard with the money still on it
lol. I remember seeing these in my local Fred Meyer and thinking about buying, but they were there for months...  For the other one, do you bag them when they're known infested? I'd be paranoid about eggs hatching and infesting the workshop.
Bro ill send you mine right now, mine has been going into a safe mode loop and doesnt fix😂😂😂 it says i need to update, but i get en error when i try to.
If it weren't a ps4, I would probably try fixing the original motherboard so the serial number will match the shell
I've seen 3 on eBay after 5 minutes, can't believe these were hard to find
I just thought of an amazing idea after you talked about the alcohol. So, hear me out, but you should get drunk before trying to fix something. I think it would be tremendously entertaining. If you agree like this comment so Mr. Fix sees it.
Wait, who's the other YouTuber!?
Any chance you could just go ahead and tell us what  YouTuber you sent the motherboard to for repair?  I have been watching all the content I can find on PS repair, as my son has a broken PS3 (one of the rare ones that is backwards compatible via hardware) that I either want to fix myself, or send out for repair.  It would be very helpful to know the names of other YouTube channels that either offer repair or show you  how to DIY it.
We wanted to see the peel to celebrate fixing the PS4!  Also, why not go with an SSD instead of just installing another HDD?
Can you show your collection pleas make vidoe
The only thing I wanted was to see that plastic come off how could you toy with my emotions
StezStix Fix?, My Mate VINCE or Joey Does Tech
sorry, but the roachboard would be a no-go for me
Send it to @thecod3r Steven you brilliant and fixing stuff
Hey Steve, couple questions. Did you change the disc drive also from infested console since motherboard and drives are bonded? And did this version has a home screen theme that differentiate from normal consoles if it had that I think you should reconsider fixing and putting original motherboard back. Thanks for the videos.
Personally I would not like a serial number mismatch between motherboard and sticker on the back so i hope you get that board fixed
Hi there, about cleaning the xbox series x will it be okey to use a vacuum chube or will it damage the console
you know how many cockroaches one must have for them to be found inside consoles 🤮🤮
I remember a few of these being sold in my country, for about $900, back in 2019/2020. If I knew they were so rare, maybe I would've gotten one.
Smart move at the end! Don’t let the party stop here! Great vid!
Ok, but serious question, why a hard drive in 2023? Like, you can get name brand 2tb 2.5" SSDs for around 150usd? I don't know, I don't watch videos about consoles, but in my experience with computers that extra 25 bucks is way more than worth it... Maybe I'd understand if you were getting the cheapest hard drive possible to just quickly flip it, but your getting a decent Seagate drive so its really not that much cheaper?
A limited edition cool looking console like this deserves an SSD upgrade, I did it to mine when I had and since the PS4 Pro uses SATA III it will take good advantage of it unlike the base PS4 which is only SATA II ofc it will still not be on the PS5 level but not too far behind!
I couldn't watch 🤢
13:44 dandruff Scene
I've mentioned it before, but using small makeup brushes instead of q-tips would be better! The small eyeshadow or lip ones.
Such a source of inspiration! Thanks Steve! I was repairing a lot of consoles in 2021 and a little into 2022 but stopped and recently started watching your videos again. These make me want to dig around in broken stuff to find a fix. Great videos and great attitude!
If you have cockroaches in your house, you have bigger problems and  probably shouldn't have a PS4.
I hate when people buy something brand new and don't peel off the film before they use the product. That film at this point has been on for 4 years and it doesn't help protect the system at all.
Did you forget to switch the disc drives as well? Or are they not paired to the boards?
That’s cool I miss my ps4.
I wanted one of those so bad when it was released.
Awesome video, but now I need to know, who did you send the board to?
$592? That's more than the RRP of one of these things - totally not worth it, in my opinion...
9:15 just start cod mw2 ez bug fix
Are you sending the mobo to MyMateVince?
Who did you send it to so I can watch the follow up? I don't know of the other tech repair people on Youtube.
Wow. That's one cool ps4. Had no idea they existed. Wonder how much more money it's costs for that extra memory and special case.
Air-dusting dirty heat sinks is one of life's simple pleasures
4:14 - oh god, no! Seagate Barracudas are literally the most vulnerable HDDs that you can find
Looks like the pefect amount of cockroaches to me!
The Cod3r?
This was all a labor of love! And it paid off in the end
Ps4 500 million “roach motel” edition.
Just to clear it up... Cockroaches inside a PS4 doesn't mean the person that owned it is a dirty person. My house is pretty much spotless, but because we live near a field and woods, we are prone to bugs and other stuff. I went through 2 PS4s before I learned how to take them apart. Most of the time it was the power supply. I have to take my PS5 apart once a month to clean it out. I don't smoke, so that's never been an issue.
... And peel the knackered film off and apply a new one, they can be bought cheaply.
9:26 If you have cockroaches in your house, CLEAN YOUR DAMN HOUSE!!!
had to pass on this video - was eating
Is it still considered a special edition when it's just the shell and disc drive?
the 500m limited edition Xbox of Theseus.
Hope you sent it to Vince.
I would just submerge the board in deionized water (like for a car battery) with a splash of IPA and use a brush.
The guy that bought that shouldn't have opened it. That will be worth loads in 10-20 years
This PS4 looks very good!
I still have mine sealed. Cant get myself to open it after all these years. lol
Dirty ass people
Funny enough, those bugs are "good" ones. You can clean them fairly easily. At least you deBUGGED it. Some bugs are in games or HW... FOREVER!  By the way, about that thermopaste - I once tried to re-paste my PC and it worked (same style as you did). But much later on, when IT tech replaced weaker processor for stronger one, he basically said I´m a moron, becuse it needed one small drop of it. So I don ´t  really know.
steve i think it was better to check to main motherboard, for your last videos i dont see fixing you just change the parts,but before i saw you work on the bb boards and you solve the problem on the broken board not changiy the part,as your fan i subscribe you to learn fixing ps and xbox boards not changing good motherboard to broken motherboard
For anybody that has cockcroaches in their consoles, Instant negative rizz.
I guess it's going to Alex
I wanted this one so bad when it came out. ❤
the fan wasn't that much more clean, could have done better.  still looked dirty, why go through the extra effort to only clean it 50%
That boards destined for TheCod3r!!!
is he sending it to Andrew Paul?
Great video as usual, with the amount of crap you clean how do you not have a compressor or one of those handheld air compressors?
how can you just remove a hdd and put in a new one? doesnt the OS read from the HDD? how does the system boot with a blank HDD and no OS? this question has always stumped me
how do people completely gouge and scratch the heck out of their consoles is beyond me. If that plastic was not on top, this console would be so scratched up and ruined cosmetically.
I hate when people leave the plastic on beautiful machines on, it ruins the look of it
My job is working with cockroaches and other invertebrates (science educator). most of what was in there were moults and poo. My roaches love their tropical fruits to eat! Luckily they have a nice terrarium and not a home in my ps4 ahaha
You sending the broken one to the coder? Anyways, if I may? When me and my son did a PS4 Pro (bad hd and dirty) we use soft hair brushes for the deep areas. Works wonders. Another PS4 Pro saved from the scrapper. Also, since roaches pee and poop, you also have to watch for their urine and fecal remains. They are acidic and if left too long, that can cause corrosion on the circuit pathways. Also that makes the dirt stick even worse. Great video though!!!
Isn't the canned air spray flammable? Is it safe to use it on things like that?
I wanted one of those so badly. But in hindsight, it's ok.
Are we going to see this on the coder's channel soon?
Who are you sending the motherboard to? I want to watch
I am over here still excited about my PS3 lol. I figure by the time PS6 comes out I will have a PS4.
😇👍
Bro people are disgusting.
I bet you'll send it to TheCod3r
idk abt other people but id love an asmr-like compilation of cleaning consoles/parts. i think it’d be so relaxing to watch and listen to
The motherboard part was making my skin crawl 😮‍💨
Gross. What is up with all the bug infested consoles. Do they attract bugs or are they just in really gross places?
Cockroach corpse heat sink pads on the ram...  very nasty.
Yes, that's a bottle of IPA.  But I don't think that's isopropyl lol
I like your fix videos. I wish I could understand repair work like you.Who is the other youtuber by the way?. Can you share with us ?
For the love of God Almighty, why the hell cockroaches ended up in a gaming console, in what conditions did the owner lived when he was playing it...sheesh.
(while far from being the same thing), you just inspired me to fix a PS1 (was a gift form a good friend of mine) by also replacing the motherboard. The original issue is the optical drive power socket came off while trying to remove the optical drive power cable.
What happened to the stand?
I just worked on a Wii U gamepad the other day and it had way more bugs then it needed to, I think the joysticks were the nests, it was real bad
I want one of those Perfect Amount of Thermal Grease shirts, but also I want to know how much IS the perfect amount of thermal grease?
I wonder who has number 1-10 of the 50 thousand.
Awesome! nice unit!
U sir are an absolute gem 💎
I just don't know how people's houses can be so dirty that they have cockroaches... or is it a more common thing in America?
That console was gross. I have never had a console get bugs in it. I have no idea how people let their houses get that bad.
Isopropyl Vodka...
I only have the controller. And it's still sealed. If I had that console. It would have never been opened.
Hmm a bit of cheating goin on here.🤔
I don't understand how you're so skeeved out by roach bits, yet so casual with the dust on other the parts. You know that dust is comprised mostly of *human skin cells*, right?
Bro you need a vacuum attatchment to vacuum the dust from heatsinks and so forth. There are good ones with a brush too.
I hope you send that motherboard over to Coder to repair.
whos going to fix the board?
Are you giving it again to the: TheCod3r to fix? Nice PS4 pro special...but more then 500$ broken...wow!
Who did you sent the motherboard to?
Great video as always. Can anyone tell me why replacing the hdmi port wasn’t an option? Maybe it’s something I missed from the video. Thank you
Hey I need some help on my ps4
Back in the day seagate was a cheapie budget brand
Is it going to Phill, in the UK Steve? Consolefix/thecoder?
Will a ps4 take discs while experiencing BLOD?
Hey you should get a air compressor
so glad I finished my breakfast before the halway mark of the video >.<
hopefully its JoeydoesTech…. 😊
you also could have placed a new power supply into the bug affected console and sell it as "special" edition as well
Are you going to send it to Joey does tech like you did with that ds mobo
I always wonder why you don't have a small, 15 gallon air compressor. It would make cleaning the out dust from cooling systems much easier.
Anyone can replace the motherboard. Replacing APU/mem chip is a whole different matter. But it is doable.
Instead of using compressed air, you can pick up a little air compressor cheap.  I got an old air mattress air pump and it works brilliantly for a $2 investment.  If you look, you can actually find these little air compressors at thrift stores quite frequently.  They sell similar ones for PC cleaning for like $25 - $50, easily pays for itself after 5+ cans of air.
I find your Videos Super Informational Thank you for These!
Have you also repaired a blocked ps4?
My brother gave me his ps4 pro that he broke (the power port) I don’t know if I should attempt to replace it, I took it to a repare place but they say they couldn’t and well I don’t have more money to put into it 😢. Can someone tell me where can I get the little power piece that connects to the motherboard? I really want to save the ps4 pro because it has a 3Terabyte hard drive in. Thanks!
VINCE!!
Maybe fix some Guitar for PS3 or Xbox? They are quite rare in Good condition.
While, its true any bug infestation in a console is gross, its also a pretty straight forward process to clean up especially with a quality ISO, and well worth the effort to have a fully function console.
@tronicsFix How do you make it seem so effortless to remove the connectors with tweezers? Every time I try, I can't get a good grip.
Are you going to send to the cod3r?
Am I the only person who thinks the translucent plastic looks awfully tacky? Especially the controller!
Bought my 500 millionth when it came out. I did pay a little more for it, but it’s a beautiful looking system
How is it even possible to have roaches in your house? Do those people eat on the floor or what? Ive never seen a living roach in my house in my entire life.
Hope it's stezstix fix 😁😁😁😁
HEY if you like to clean a lot of hair and do not have a roach infested PS4,  then check out the back of your toilet you will find a lot there!
The YouTuber you sent it to was the coder! I feel it
Where did he send the board?  I guess Louis Rossmann
Did you swap the board in the DVD drive?
I'm from Germany, we don't have cockroaches. Or maybe we do and it's not that big of a deal here. I'm not sure. So, I'm curious. How bad is it over there for you guys? Is it common to have cockroaches in your electronic devices or is it just a case of "haven't cleaned the house for 5 years"
Ok🤷🏼‍♂️ u only put a standard pro motherboard in a 500 shell in my opinion I fix the original motherboard🤷🏼‍♂️for instance u have an Audi a6.buying a bumper kit and engine from an rs6 etc for it and saying it’s a Audi rs6. So it will be a knockoff 🤡
Awesome video!!!
Wow what a deal to get it in such amazing condition with all original packaging and documentation.
My Favorit PS4  Place 2 the 25th anavirsity  Place 3 MGS4 Place 4 death stranding
Do you ever get retro consoles and fix them  Could be awesome to see something like a n64 or dreamcast getting fixed
Hey, can I have the link to the mat you use when doing disassembly and reassembly?
100% going to StezStix Fix? ! Love your channel ❤
Great video as always! Happy new year! 🇺🇦❤️
Would have been more interesting to see the original board fixed, rather than a simple swap
He seriously just ended the video with that film still on there.
To replace a motherboard, does it have to be the same model number for the console?
Well. Sorry for that motherboard. But a really cool video. I never knew there was a 5 milion edition.
sorry but the zoom noise is very distracting pls don't include it in future vids (y)
I held my breath hoping the second time I’d turn on. I digress you are awesome at what you do and definitely inspire me to leave things clean like you do.
I just found one of this, in working condition, on eBay for $3000. Wow.
That's dope, wish they had more promos for their consoles because I didn't even know these existed, I just found out last year Sony had a special Sakura design PS2 only launched in Japan
Put the gloves and wear a mask beforehand.  Try to obtain boric acid if you are having difficulty dealing with infestation.
Seagate HDDs are NOT decent AT ALL. They suck; get a SATA SSD.
I would highly recommend not using the Seagate two terabyte barracuda drive. I had one fail on me two years later and it caused me a lot of problems because it was on my jailbroken PS4 and that means that I can't get my games that I had downloaded or other things back that were associated with my profile. Highly recommended different drive anything but the Seagate. It's a known faulty drive by the company and a lot of people have experiences specifically by using them in PS4 pros. If you do a quick Google search you'll find the information that I'm giving you.
Congrats on the better than new PS4!
If i sent you a tablet would you repair it for me on the show mabey? the USB connector inside the port is chipped off. Otherwise is a perfect tablet just over a year old.
Now I wanna know who you sent that board to.  I really enjoy these videos, they helped me buy a broken PS4 a year or two ago and get it fixed up and it's still working.
i'd like a followup. i find it hard to believe it could be a user error. you had a seller that wanted to use it himself so he plugged it up.
Wow, really cool. Nice asmr cleaning the heatsink BTW 👌
I'm pretty sure it's Cod3r.
New fear unlocked —> my PS5 getting bug infested 😮 (never knew such thing could happen, and I wish I didn’t find out 😅)
4:07 You've installed a 2TB 3.5 mechanical HDD in it? Who uses mechanical HDDs this days? Come on, put in an SSD!
I bet my firstborn that he is sending it to the lad in the UK that fixed another PS4 board that was having some bad ram chips. Forgot his name but i subscribed on his channel years ago. Let s hope the motherboard can be fixed
I'd always use a ssd
My Mate Vince about to get a PS4 board in the mail (maybe)
Your videos have a great way for I and my youngest son to take on a project. We got the tool kit that you show on your videos and love them. Thanks again for sharing the great videos. Thanks David 😊
How much would it cost to fix a broken controller ? And do you sell controllers as well ?
Should actually put an ssd in it that would make it as good as it can get
Nicely done Steve!
Damn the dust left on the fan especially on a see through console irritated me beyond belief lol. Nice work though as usual!
I lost my ps3 to a Lightning Strike… I would have loved to send it to you 0:46
If you ever want a spider man ps4 pro lmk ;)
Board goes to theCod3r...
Awesome video and console but, help a boyo out what gloves you use?
Wish you fix one every week I do enjoy watching
Does anyone know the Youtuber who might've fixed the broken motherboard?
Just use a manual spray bottle with IPA for the cleaning. Use the toothbrush like you did. Finally you just spray it with plenty of IPA holding the board vertically and then blow it with compressed air (high pressure, not from a bottle). Fast and easy.
Am I the only one who wanted to know what the board smelled like after getting cleaned?
Weren't the optical drives tied by firmware to the motherboard? Or was that only on the Xbox?
why dont you put the bad smelling ones in a ultrasonic cleaner?
i get it its rare but essentially all you paid for was the case on the limited edition idk feels kinda not worth it imo wish it did something cool.
that PS4 Pro looks amazing! Awesome 👏🏻
Awesome
I just found one of these controllers at a Mardens a few weeks ago for $75. Was honestly suprised to see it there at all.
Just seen one on ebay for £ 26,000
Wow I can't believe you paid 500 million for it. 😺
I'm waitign for a ps5 slim ;)
I am the proud owner of one with the number 08262 and the best part is that i won it in a newspaper competition, and i kept as much of the protective film on the console to protect it as much as i can.
You're getting pretty dang good applying the perfect amount of thermal paste
I have a ps4 pro that has the blue light of death, and cant figure out the issue, what to do?
woof! Gross, but cool.
Do you use any kind of ESD protection for you repair ? An ESD bracelet or something? I never see one of those in your videos 🧐
50 million edition complete with 50 million roaches
Think you can cheer Louis up with that?
I tried to get one of these at release but it was impossible 😮
You selling this one?
Can't wait to see TheCod3r work on it 🙂.
I saw the purple bag the console is in and assumed there would be a bottle of Crown Royal in there.
Did you send it to Louis Rossman @rossmanngroup?
I was able to get mine when it launched. Still mounted on my wall.
im not a big ps guy, this is dope though...never even heard of these
Anyone still reball ps3’s?
If you know someone with a resin printer, you might be able to print out some replacement parts.  There are dye kits for resin so you can color match it.
This video is a nice weekend gift. Thank you.
I've done the 'pour IPA and toothbrush' combo on a board before and was worried if it was safe.  Glad to see Steve's approval
“It’s not that dirty” 😂more like roach war world 4
How can I get contact with you I have some questions about my ps4 pro it isnt working basically hardrive issues I'll explain more if u can get ahold of me please and thank u
I came to watch a repair video, not a motherboard transplant.
Awesome and excellent first video of the year, Happy new year Steve and your family....
You should keep this one in a collection!!
At this rate one day one of the repair channels will just bring out a gigantic cockroach infested with PS4s
I've never seen a warranty that covers roach damage, but maybe they should start. Man that's nasty stuff.
The cod3r watch incoming ps4 board with faults
Your going to send it to the cod3r
this is a case of the Ship of Theseus? if you replace the parts is still the Theseus' Ship?
I really need the blue vertical stand and the blue earbuds. Were i can find it???please help me
@thecod3r send it to the cod3r
Had 2 of these, although both were only in good condition only…want a near mint to new.
Isn't the optical drive married to the board on ps4s? If so, your PS4 500million wouldn't play the disks
Be you sent it off to The Cod3r
What youtuber are you sending the broken PS4 Pro Motherboard too? I do not know. I am interested to see if it can be fixed.
Dude I love your channel but you didnt even try fixing the motherboard.  No testing no nothing. Why? You are huge in this space, why not getting a reflow machine and go more in depth or try other things?
Question. How are you able to change the motherboard, but not the disc drive? They are married to each other, so wouldn't this lead to only having a blu ray player and it not being able to play PS4 Games?
Here did you send the board? Did you link the Channel anywere?
I’m guessing that board is heading to TheCoder ... if anyone can fix it he can 👍😀
send it to stezfix so he can rap for you
I think you should change the thumbnail to what is in the box but blur it. From my understanding it would help the view count of the video (don’t count on my thoughts yes though I’m still trying to make stuff of my own on a separate account)
That translucent blue is phenomenal! I'm a sucker for translucent things, still have my translucent atomic purple gameboy color
Pls!! give that board to  TheCod3r!! Pls!! And greetings from Argentina!!
Say Hi my favorite youtuber
Best thing was when this came out people tried to sell for thousands and in the end no one was willing to pay way over the odds
I never heard of this version...
Ive just eaten
Right when he said it might be an APU issue i was thinking about TheCod3r... :D
Wow that controller looks so good. I really wish manufacturers still made translucent controllers.
Great job! The bugs in that ps4 were gross! Little concerned about my ps3 now,I bought it from an area that was warm enough for cockroaches..... 😳
Bruh you really didn't peel that film off after doing all that, great video by the way.
Hi I bet you going to send that broken board to the Cod3r. Great vid man...
What do you clean the boards with? Just IPA? On another channel that I watch that fixes Classic Arcade Boards (Classic Arcade Repairs), he cleans the boards with Simple Green. I know that will get rid of any smell that there is!! Also not sure if just for the video, invest in one of the Data Vac hand blowers! You save so much over canned air and they are so much more powerful!  Last, you sending the board to Cod3r I bet like you did in your past video..
im scared to see mine
It seems like I'm loving my console more and more thanks to you.
It would be more interesting to find out the true cause of that BLOD, but I guess that's TheCOd3r's territory, right?
13:12 Thank you for enunciating "discs" very clearly there.
Going to TheCod3r? 👍
Back in the day when "rent to own" electronics was a much bigger thing (CRT TV's and VCRs in particular) it was very common to find roaches and other bugs living inside of repossessed units.  Many stores would fumigate all repossessed electronics prior to offering them for sale again.
Just curious do you have an air purifier where you clean the consoles?
It's kind of obvious you sent that motherboard to Shane fix
Oh man, the absolute best looking PS4 they made! Glad you finally got your hands on one! I can't justify the cost of even the controllers anymore, let alone a whole console XD
Preordered mine from Best Buy. It's number 34474/50000. Also got the matching headset and extra controller. First thing I did was put in a 2tb ssd. Still works great!
Gosh, it's hard to watch the cleaning bug part of this one. Great find on the rare one!
Steve, with the recent news that PS5s may fail prematurely due to liquid metal spillage when installed in the vertical position, some people are recommending keeping it horizontally.   But when placed in the "designed" horizontal orientation, the liquid metal is then sitting facing downwards and is being pulled down away from the board by gravity. Should the PS5 actually be installed the reverse horizontal way so that the liquid metal is then just resting on the board and facing upwards to ensure longevity?
Mobo definitely going to the dude in the UK. Great video as always Steve!
I got a feeling that mother board is going to pommy land
Bro you were saying they made 500 million limited edition lol
It's crazy what cleaning can do to your old consoles. Your videos have inspired me to venture into this myself and I got a lot of supplies for x-mas to get started. Cleaned out my old Game Boy Color and replaced 2 batteries in my Pokemon games (although I need some practice with soldering, haha!). Cleaning my Game Boy Color did wonders to it and the sound/power work better than ever.   One question, I have the same digital microscope you have, but I have found myself struggling with holding down the mother boards of the cartridge games. Are there any small clips you would recommend to help hold down while I am soldering and won't damage the board? Feels like I always need a 3rd arm for these things 😂
There is far worse than having cockroaches inside a PS4. It's too have them in your meal, in your dishes, in your bed... And I know what i'm talking about as i've experienced it when, as a teen, i was living with my parents in an appartement @ the 8th floor of a tower
Unboxing this system was actually my very first Youtube upload back in 2018!!
Steve, with as much compressed air as you use, you should have an air compressor instead of canned air probably. :)
what kinda brushes do you recommend for cleaning fans and heatsinks ?
But Steve dont you have to also take out the board from the disc drive of that infested PS4 Pro in order for it to work? i thought those were parented with the motherboards, so if you swap motherboard you also gotta swap that, dont you?
Hey steve, where are you selling that ps4 pro? I'd like to get my hands on one with the assurance that it'll work fine
Sent to thecoder
I’ve been wanting to fix a console have an extra on hand
I’ve actually taken the colored fat PS2s from Japan and swapped an American motherboard in, matched the laser bios to the original one from the Japanese drive with FreeMCboot and the lens changer program. Reason I mention this is that I have a translucent ocean blue model that’s see through like this where I did that swap 😎👍🏻
Long-time Xbox guy here, I love the 500m edition of the PS4. I really wish Microsoft would do something similar, it looks so good!
but it's not that special now though
Should've put a bit of hot air (100°C works) onto the warranty sticker before peeling so it doesn't "void" it. Obviously no warranty anyway but a fresh sticker looks better
I used to watch your videos as you were cleaning roaches from consoles and say "this dude is crazy".  Last week I was going through a big console lot I bought and cleaning out roaches from the inside of an Xbox 360 saying to myself "this is crazy". 🤣  I really enjoy all of your of your work my friend. It's inspired many of us to step out and learn new things. 👌
I remember I could've bought one of these consoles, I had the money and there was one available at a local Sam's club, in the end I didn't buy it because I felt I could've used the money for something better. I ended up spending it in food for my dogs and a some accesories for my gaming laptop. I kind of regret not buying this ps4 but I guess it was for the best.
Who is the other youtuber?
I have always wanted this version of the ps4 just because of how awesome it looks 😍😔
Awesome! What's the plan for this console? Keep it? Sell it? It's beautiful!
I was already thinking it's going across the pond and there's the man himself Cod3r lol
I'm guessing its getting sent theCod3r
Great video! Anything to save that beauty even a big cleaning.😅 I'm a guess you are sending the board too Joeydoestech.
Lol I got that same blue bottle of alcohol at work
I wonder if its going to Hugh Jefferys
cool console
peel it!!!!!!!
Is a great thing doing what you love as your everyday job, that means that you'll never work a day in your life! 🙂
Nice repair job. Excellent.
You don't have a compressor?
Managed to get one of these 500M PS4s and was like a giddy school kid. It's a bit scratched up now but didn't want to let it sit in a box unused forever! Love the transparent light section when the blue power light comes on, it looks awesome!
I'm curious of what the cockroach smell sounds like. Can you describe it Steve?
Ppl sell this one on Facebook for $3000. I always thought it was a crock. Guess I'll buy it then
How does a person let it get to the point where they have a cockroach infestation inside a device that’s inside the home
I bet you are sending it to the Coder!
Hey Sony, maybe put a mesh screen on any vents or openings on your next console, people are a little tired of bugs
I have one of those mines is 38,871
I have one of those mines is 38721
Please buy yourself a decent compressor and not the cans. And longer brushes, then you can also clean the fan better.
Great video, and I love these collaborations. Your iPod video introduced me to DankPods!
I remember that "fancy" ps4.  I think there was also one for 500 million sales. I also remember the 20th anniversary one.  I think the first design of the PS4 was the best, but I don't like the glossy plastic. (Think later, it was changed to Matte plastic)
Just a tip on cleaning transparent plastics. You should rather use a microfibre cloth to clean them, this will prevent you from making any very noticeable scratches.
Loved this video definitely helped my Friday 😃 awesome find on that ps4
The bug ones are so disgusting. 🤢
On PS4 PRO APU best is Honeywell PTM7950 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 better than any thermal paste and liquid metal
You need to do more special edition stuff. It’s great!
Zack is def getting that board
Maybe a shop tour would be cool like a behind the scenes look
7day sleep 😀
I wish this was just how they looked. We need that early 2000s translucent plastic back.
I wanna see one after GameStop Refurbished it lol
Is the new board on a firmware that's still exploitable?
If you have roaches:. Sell console, hire exterminator.
Welcome to California bruh!
Apu Repairs are easy. I’m surprised you don’t do that kind of work.
Find somebody to take care of you just like he’s taking care of that special edition Playstation 4
Just a question, at this point why don't you get a reflow station or tools to do that proces, it will help you a lot to try to fix consoles that you have deemed unfixable
That PS4 Pro motherboard got quite the upgrade from it's old home.
Why not a SATA ssd? Much faster than any hdd
Don't you have an ultrasonic cleaner you could use for boards like that?
how is 500 milions is limited edition?
Nice Steve 😃
I already had a feeling it was going to be the 500 million edition since you didn't show it in the thumbnail and  great video by the way
stop with the zooming noise its terrible to listen to
You should’ve put the old hard drive in to see if there’s any special 500m stuff on it
do all that work and didn't even upgrade to an SSD?
I got one of these when they first released them. Ended up with system # 33,333. Still have it and it still works perfectly.
grill the smelly ones at a reasonable temp and the smell should go away
I am kind of curious that if you changed the mother board and not flipped the chip, is it now just a regular PS4 with the 500m shell? Does the 500m do anything special? Does it have a 500m unique display when it starts up?
Man the 500m edition is really special looking. Love it!
Was this console actually used ?
Oh god ... the donor PS4 ...
Man that is not a fix ...👉👈
Beautiful machine, must get my hands on one soon. I’m sure Phil the coder will appreciate fixing the board now he has his new chip templates for reflows
Forgive me. What fixed it in the end?
Wow, long term PS lover, I had no clue this existed beautiful console and controller.
So glad you uploaded I love your videos
The Coder will definitely fix it
"If you have a PS4 in a place with cockroaches..." HUH? Who on earth would knowingly and willingly just let cockroaches be in their home?! I always feel like this is bizarrely common.
Surprised you don't vacuum them out
The perfect compliment to this system wouldve been a Solid State Drive to boost its performance and load times.
Did you send the motherboard to My Mate Vince? 😀
Did the smell from the donor motherboard go away?
i am jealous i have always wanted one i cant believe my friend has one and treats it so poorly!
Awesome! A very neat PS4 Pro model. One question though, I thought the disc drive is married to the motherboard. Isn't that the case for the PS4 Pro?
The motherboard transplant is awesome, but I can't fathom why you'd use a roach stained one for such a rare special edition.  Even sanitizing it, there's still stains that don't come off or go away.  I guess you can always swap a clean board in later when you find a match.  I guess it just feels wrong to use a worn, damaged piece to fix such an otherwise great condition console.  Still, the video was great, as always!
By far my favourite looking PS4, but can you imagine the scene if it had the roach infection, it would be like your own little farm, and I think Vince might be in the picture for a motherboard fix lol, great fix Steve.
Hi honey, what did you do today?  Just the usual, hardware debugging ;)
:D
Phil will definitely be able to fix .. then hopefully you can swap the Limited edition board back into limited edition case
Have you ever considered buying an air compressor? You'll get a ROI super fast given the price of those duster cans.
I love watching your content!
Sent to the cod3r?
There is also a likelihood that roaches are attracted somehow by electromagnetic radiation given off by electronic devices. Otherwise there are plenty of other warm places they could go, but they seem to congregate in electronics in particular.
TheCod3r
I've got 5 Xbox controllers that need repairing - Watching your videos have given me the knowledge to try and repair them myself. I think...
Don't eat while watching this one
Definitely not the cod3r lol, he'll get it fixed!!
Reminds me of a roach infested car someone gave me. A factory workmanship defect in that when the car was built who or whatever applied the car body seam seal compound applied too much sealant at the taillight housing area and rain water would pour in and fill the spare tire well.  The car's owner was an elderly person so I can't blame them.  The roaches had a water supply. I repaired that boo boo and applied a homemade taillight housing gasket.  Low mileage but I spent a lot time removing all the leftover dead roaches(hundreds) and their feces. I practically nuked the whole interior of the car with cleaning materials.  It took a few months after that for the roach smell to go away. Sometime afterwards I observed a roach trying to get into the car through the cowl air intake vent but the mesh was too small for it to pass  Your video brought up the memory of what it smelled like. Yuck!
I dont wanna see the home if the playstation is already this disgusting :o
Would have been nice to see you 'actually' fix the PS4. Do you really not do any board level repair?
That is such a nice looking console! 😍
I never again trust Seagate HDDs. I'm a computer technician and I had some HDDs die on me. But only two of them started to burn and caused fires. Both of them were Seagate Barracuda drives.
WARNING. Don't eat while watching this video.  Like so people can see this before starting the session.
Im glad you finally found one! That Transclearant blue is so majestic and pretty!
I remember when these came out too, and I wanted to get one but had no luck. I love the translucent shell. I wouldn't be able to afford one now, not even a broken one with my current financial situation, but that's okay. Videos like this help out. :)
I didn’t even know this existed… I’m a big PlayStation fan too.. this is bad ass
How this man still hasn't bought an ultrasonic cleaner for dirty boards and such is insane. lol
I was expecting a fix on the original MB rather than a full replacement, but whatever works :)
That will be the cod3er your sending it too then 😁
Love it! You saved 500 Million Edition 🥹
🥹
Lunchtime release. Not lunchtime appropriate HA. This video took a nasty turn lol
I don't see why manufacturers can't make vent grilles smaller than bugs.
I didn't even know the 500 million edition was a thing.
Do not even let me in your home if you still have the peel-offs on your electronics. I WILL remove them.
Motherboard to TheCod3r
The controller is missing a sticker at the bottom, no?
Is the roach issue a US thing mostly? Never seen this in the UK.
Who designed this? It looks terrible. Why bother with translucent case when there's just another case inside and you can't see any internals? Would be so much cooler if you could see fan and disc spinning, not to mention the motherboard. Or if they made it in PS1 colors.
Hey Steve can you find a console that got struck by lightning because my family friend’s son’s ps5 was at his girlfriend’s and it got struck by lightning and would not turn on if you ask me if you can have it I don’t think he has it anymore and just bought a new one
Neat video! I looked through your Amazon list, I didn't see the bottle you have with that little reservoir for your IPA. What's it called!
This is how I am selling stuff :) Complete package.
What about the stand ??
I Was Here! 17,797 views
By TronicsFix fashion I would think that it's labeled as broken but it works like new xD
What is the name of the channel that you send the bord😊
When he cleaned the heatsink I sneezed.
Question. Im trying to clean my ps4 and the long screw that holds the metal sheet under the top plate is stripped. What can i use to get it out?
theres one on ebay canada for 750can free shipping in box. its... a price
Is this just an American thing I've never seen bugs in a console in the UK
Bro im eating while watching this man clean a mother board of dead cockroach remains. Making me want to clean my gamecube before I turn it on again.
For the ps4 pro motherboard the coder
Nice find. I too have been looking for one for a while now.
Question: what if I installed some fine mesh to cover the holes? The only thing I can think of going wrong is the potential for dust to collect on the mesh which could restrict air flow. Other than that, as MattKC said, “I cleaned it with a lot of alcohol... and some ipa for the board.”
These BLOD boards are such hit or miss. Except for Phil (thecoder) almost always fixable haha
Spillin bottles of alcohol and hundreds of roaches stashed in a ps4? Must be new years at tronicsfix!
I would have liked to see what the actual problem was and trying to see the diagnosis of the original motherboard.
Dead roaches inside ps4
This is Definitely the PS4 I was upset I couldn't get. Looks so good.
roaches are the worst
Sending to "TheCod3r" for sure.
I wonder if the original hdd/os/software had a special theme installed too 🤔
I bought one last year and it is amazing console! I did an unboxing video in my tech channel.
Very good job 👏 😊
I wanted to see you peel that film cover off! 😫
Great work! but I never saw that ac power cord plug before. is it only limited edition stuff?
Shame they weren't still alive with the see through edition it could have been like one of those ant farm kits but with roaches instead!   What?
Nice video!!! Love ur videos tronix !!!! Keep em coming !!!
Great video so interesting to watch I love case of the pa4.
I don’t understand why people would rather buy a gaming console to having their house remediated of bugs.
31,513/50,000 here! Welcome to the club!
I've never been a fan of the triple-stack PSFro design, but that's a very nice dark blue finish.
Literally?
How do you deal with bug infested consoles? Do you have a quarantine area to make sure you do not get an infestation in your place? Do you use a special kind of treatment to make sure all bugs are dead ?
Happy New Year, Steve!
IS 500 MILLION CONSIDERED RARE?
How're there comments that are a day old on a video that was released 40 minutes ago?
Would be sick to see your console collection!
Is it Louis Rossmann?
Dude that motherboard needed an IPA power wash it was so groady! Amazing fix Steve!
I got one of those I got it from ebay it came with everything except the stand
Steve = Quality❤
Yes send it to phil @TheCod3r he's brilliant :)
That was the worst bug infestation I've ever seen on a console. Props to you for cleaning all of that disgusting roach stuff.
u selling it ?
You keep forgetting to tell people that the disc drive is coded to certain boards
2 questions.  1. What is the ipa dispenser do you use?   2. What do you have to suck up the dust in studio when you blow out the consoles?
I bet you sent it to The Cod3r!!!
Thecod3r will enjoy that motherboard. Wink 😉
Would soaking in IPA or a ultrasonic bath remove the smell?
Did you send the board to Alex at Northridge Fix?
Xbox is so bad even roaches won't aproach it
I’m going to guess you are sending it to Cod3r.
Put roach motels by your Play Stations. 😁
noo shot you put that disgusting motherboard in there that is VILE bro ☠
For bug infested motherboard, if the smell doesn't go away, try leaving the board or hardware in a bag full of camphor and handful of dry rice for about 24 hours and you'll notice that ugly smell will be gone.  You'll still need to clean the board with isopropyl alcohol later
Nice! вытери это
Eating while wathing wasnt a good idea...
put 2 tb ssd
We need more clear electronics
Happy new year Steve, i really love those special editions. Great video and nice to get it working. I hope you or someone else can fix the original mobo.
If this one is so special, why not a 2.5" SSD?
Bet he can Steve! 😂 thanks for the video
Where was the motherboard mailed to???
Hi, many thanks from Russia. Your videos motivate me to keep consoles clean 👍
I love see through cases but man they show scratches real easily if they arent textured. Im also sorry you had to deal with the roachstation 4. Das nasty
Cool
I hate when I see roach infested clean-ups,they're nasty and freak me out!
Great video, i cant imagine living in a roach invested home!
I wish your shop was near me in Portugal Azores lol my ps4 still works well but sometimes discs dont work at first try
I was the 500th like on a 500M LE console video. I think I'll buy a lottery ticket today! Great vid, hopefully, in the future, you wont have to deal with so many roaches.
you can ultrasonic clean and give it a good wash well worth the time and effort steve.
I might be late, but instead of using compressed air cans, can You use electric air blower/compressed air instead? Since you don't need to pay much.
have you considered buying an air compressor or at least a handheld blower? the compressed air cans are not very practical
i wonder who is he sending it to fix. (actually) ? anyone have an idea ?
👍👍👍👍👍👍
Someone please explain the "the perfect amount of thermal paste" joke to me please, I don't understand it T.T
I feel like it gonna be The cod3r!
they also like the humming from the electric going though the wires and whatnot
That board needs to be in the hand of NorthridgeFix guy...😃
I have one of these i stumbled across it when trying to get a PS5,  was also boxed and mint, also had an extra 500M controller and 500M headset with it, both of which where and still are sealed, so I bought it instead, and had change! still don’t own a PS5 lol  Mines number 18637
Other than the fact that they need to clean their house as to be full of disgusting roaches, this bug infested consoles must be from people putting consoles on the floor.   When will people learn that the floor is a dirty thing and stop being so disgusting.
Love the video steve i want to know have you ever worked on Microsoft Xbox Wireless Headset for Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and Windows 10 Devices i dropped mine and the mute button is stuck and i have to press hard to mute/unmute and none of the repairs shop werent interested trying to fix and im not a repairs guy haha
I had the halo green translate xbox way back in the day was a great looking console
For anyone who wants a PS4 I recommend upgrading the slow 2.5 inch mechanical drive to a 2.5 SATA SSD, they're a little more expensive for storage than an HDD but are very affordable nowadays especially compared to NVME SSDs. The change to an SSD will drastically improve loading times.
No controller cleaning? Great job though. Love seeing them come back to life!
Good job. I always watch your vídeos and that already helped me to fix a lot of things. take care and greetings from Brazil
Buuuugs. God.
Great video! So what youtuber did you sent the broken board to?
I could tell you were having fun with this one
Definitely one man who can fix it is Thecod3r
Steve have you ever considered using an ultrasonic cleaner and just dunking the board, rather than scrubbing with toothbrush/IPA?
13:39 dude take that thing outside with some compressed air, you're just flaking crap all over your shop.
Drive board isn't married to mainboard? I think you need to swap drives too, to call it fully functional...
Wow that thing was a roach motel ... Close to $600 Just for a shell Wow   Good to add to the collection
How many people got cockroaches?! I hope it's from living in apartments because all you need to do is remove their water source and they'll die
Is it going to Cod3r?
how could people live like that with COCKROACHES so Disgusting
What do you think of the stories going around that PS5 has a design flaw when placed vertically?
I have one and love it. Though i have a ps5 now, I will keep it forever. Mine is 00587. 😊
These are pretty consoles.
Great work Steve. Make sure to peel the plastic off if you plan to use it, I've had stuff like that left on where it just stuck to the console and removing it was a pain with some damage left over. Peel your stuff people lol.
The Cod3r.
If I had a nickel for every time I’ve knocked over my alcohol….
these cock roach ones are hard to watch tbo
I'll never understand why people leave the protective plastic on electronic devices. Yeah, you're protecting it from getting scuffed up and ugly by ensuring it's going to look ugly. But nice that you ended up buying a used one that still had it.
That's crazy I only ever got a Blue Light of death on a launch model PS4 but it was warrantied by Sony
Should probably remove the coin cell battery before dowsing the board in ipa
I have one good stuff man looking for the next one
500 million dollar edition more like
Looks an amazing console Steve. 👍 Bet you’re going to send that motherboard to My Mate Vince.
I love special edition consoles....hopefully we get these with the PS5
"This beautiful translucent plastic on the box"  *proceeds to throw it away* lol  Awesome video, Steve
you should get an ultra sonic cleaner. While I would clean up the obvious manually first, afterword the ultrasonic would remove the stench easily.
Could be Joey Does Tech turn for a challenge from the states but I don’t think he’s at APU repair attempting yet so makes me think The Cod3r.
hey man thanks for these videos. its amazing how much easier mobo and chipset repair is when watching your videos. not that the work is easy but i didnt think what you are doing was even possible lol
We can all agree that we like when  he says 'The perfect amount of thermal paste'
jesus this is terrifying... how do you ensure none of those pests spread to your home????
Amazing looking console!
Awesome fix Steve! You never fail to amaze me with these videos. Keep it up!
Nice's 👍
PS5 or this Ltd. Edition PS4 Pro?
Hey man your videos are amazing good job on finding one and remember to keep up the great work, I always look forward too seeing your next videos!!!
I have always wanted one of these I think they look so awesome
Wake up honey, New TronicsFix upload

Huzzah! Excellent first video of the year! Happy New Year! I hope you’re keeping this for your collection. I waited in line 4 hours for mine at a GameStop that oversold preorders. Thankfully I got the second to last one they had and still haven’t opened it. Congrats on adding this to your collection!
Awesome stuff Steve, I got my hands on a 500m controller once, sadly it was completely shattered, just like my heart when I found out. Good stuff, hopefully the original board can be fixed 👀 🤪
I would like to see more see-through console cases
