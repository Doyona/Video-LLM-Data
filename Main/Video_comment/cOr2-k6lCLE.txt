I have a crippling fear of debt too lmaoo
Such a beautiful house! Before my  husband and I bought our house in 2024 one house we looked out was built in 1920! Went to college after High School and lived in a dorm. My degree was only 2 years. So at 22 i lived partly with my boyfriends(high school sweetheart, now husband) gma and the rest of 22 I lived on my own in a rented apartment. And at 23 i got married to my high school sweetheart.
As someone who had student loan debt the fear of debt is so real. It’s not fun 🎉  But as I’m from the future… she’s gotten a mortgage and sometimes debt is ok. Especially when it has to do with your happiness (now + the future)
I can’t believe it’s been three years since you bought this house. I remember when you bought your first RV and went on your first road trip with your friends. That was a hoot.
How was watching the advertisement just as entertaining as the video
Micarah PLEASE make some of Cruella's outfits from live action "101 Dalmatians" or Disney's "Cruella". *THE TRASH DRESS or A (stuffed animal) FUR COAT!!??* I love the idea of thrifting a bunch of stuffed animals, and making a fur coat with them (and would love a tutorial..).    LOVE YOUR CONTENT, YOU'RE AMAZINGGG!!!!
I too have a Zillow addiction.
11:32
you are a delightful human being
Self affirmations: I don't believe in sidewalks.
Can i please move in
Anyone came here to reminisce after her most recent house tour? 🥰
Micarah, you will know you have met the right man to marry when he makes you as happy as buying this house made you. <3 From someone who experienced a broken engagement with a great guy, and then met Mr. Right and knew it in the depths of my soul. 8 kids later, it's great! Wishing the same for you.
Only ads I watch are yours 😅
I had such a funny funny little brain moving from UK to Rhode Island thinking I could buy a house for a very reasonable $250,000. I did find a house for $250,000 that was burned down in Washington state though!
OMG MICARAH I LOVE YOUR HOUSE CONGRATULATIONS!
omg i'm obsessed with zillow too!
Please don’t forget her comment on stalkers and creeps, that’s awful- i’m so sorry
Damn she’s sexy and funny ❤
5:52 "I won't show the front of my house" Micarah: showed it in the thumbnail
Don't show the outside of your house
So fun seeing you so happy! You will be this happy again 😊
You are by far my favorite YouTuber!!! You are so funny and inspirational, not to mention smart and gorgeous and kind!!! I have six year old daughter and I hope I do as a wonderful job raising her as your parents have with you!!!! You totally deserve your house. God bless you ❤
Ur so considerate, leaving a place for Harry potter to sleep
I liked that u lived with ur parents till u could've leave.
It’s so wholesome to watch you being happy about your house <3
I came from future and wanted to say that she does have 2 bathrooms now
Do you have a PO Box that you are comfortable giving out, to receive lovely gifts from your subscribers
CAN I COME TO UR TEA PARTTY!!!
Watching this after her 2023 Valentines video so seeing her talk about how she doesn't need a 2nd bathroom is so funny
Maybe a Regency party with your friends would help cheer you up? Hoping it gets better soon!
best youtuber fight me if u disagree
'I don't believe in sidewalks' me neither-
I also don’t believe in sidewalks. 🥹
I'm so happy for you!
So happy for you! Even if you feel people already know your location please make sure you have a good home alarm system. We have ADT and it's worth it for the peace of mind alone.
Cheesey to say, but I'm glad you never let anyone dull your sparkle
It's YOUR house but why am I crying though???
As a fellow ohioan..ian...dark romance author, sign me up for regency tea parties
Not fer nothin but you're videos are pretty funny, I laugh.
HELP HOPESCOPE 😢
That Titanic reenactment tho
When the sponsor makes you laugh out loud you know it’s a good channel
How does she know I’m scared of clowns 🤯
Do you want some eggs scrambled LOL
I wood love a house toor.i fil so happy for you
You really make me want to accept my chaotic hyped self🥺 thank you
CONGRATULATIONS!!!! Your house is GORGEOUS!!! I agree with a lot of the stuff you said! I’m living with myself parents too actually, and I share your fear of debt and mortgages! Im sorry about all those creepy guys, that’s terrible!! And ya know what…. A big brain like yours needs a big space to think in! All the best to you in this new phase of your life!!
That house that you showed is mine (I’m being funny it’s not really my house)
She said reason number w😂😂😂
her little smile at the end was so heartwarming
https://youtu.be/cOr2-k6lCLE?t=665 lol I love your dad

Wait- my brothers name is mark william
Thats a solid semicolon joke
Pls do a podcast I will watch it u are so funny and I just love u pls start a podcast
this is too precious, please invite me over to your house on bleep street
As someone in her 20s who just got her own house.......intensely relatable.
10:51 Oh sh*t! Hearing the letter you wrote to the owner reminded me I need to write my resignation letter for my current job :0 As a fellow scatterbrained person, thanks for the indirect reminder!
congrats <3 happy for youuuuuuuu
Me watching this at midnight when the rest of the people in the house are sleeping: Micarah: " i don't believe in sidewalks:)" Me: * bursts out laughing*  also i love the house!:)
This is the first time I’ve actually watched a sponsorship segment of a video.
"tewers" eh
Micarah is literally the prettiest woman i have ever seen in my entire life. Girly, i aspire to be just like you
Tewers 53234#
"I don't believe in sidewalks" Never have I related to anything more
Fear of debt is not weird, it's everywhere, especially with mortgages.
When you whispered “I love you house you make me happy” the put joy on your face made me teary lol🖤 congrats beautiful
I love it! It’s perfect!
The only reason I'm moving out next summer even tho I'm not finished college and thus am not exactly financially secure is because, well, it's kind of dysfunctional 🥴 but it's okay, I'm moving to my sister's house. GIRL THO YOU'RE MAKING ME EXCITED TO GET MY OWN HOUSE AND THAT'S LIKE YEAARRRSSS AWAY 🤣
I love you and you vids so much. I can’t wait to see what else you accomplish in you life.
You,YOU,YoU, are amazing!
shes so entertaining that she makes me excited to watch an ad
im so happy for u 😭😭😭
That was the world’s most captivating sponsorship
That was the best sponsored product ad I have ever seen
i am  tnt
wait, in one of her videos, she says she's jumped on a moving train and then jumped off. That wasn't on her illegality list XD. Either she's done the train jumping after this video was uploaded, or she's definitely hiding it from us in this one. LOL
Your dad zeroing in on reincarnation 🤣🤣
Such a creative woman. , May this house keep you safe and HAPPY  , , you have nice family please keep the love going strong  , ,it's rare these days believe me , , also did you make a video about a DIY BELLE dress from "Beauty and the Beast"  yet  ???
I love this so much 😍 Micarah is so encouraging. As also a college-less, living-with-parents individual, it makes me so happy to see that anything is possible.
The fact that she isn’t bragging but sharing her accomplishment is amazing. It shows a lot about her character.
I'm 22. My parents bought me a studio apartment and I'm so afraid that I won't be able to take care of myself financially. I was helping them pay the mortgage for that apartment, I finally was thinking wow I'm helping. And then I got fired xD I'm so glad I'm not the one paying the mortgage. I still remember how scared I was to buy a TV on my credit card xD
Congratulations 🎉🎈 🥰
Oh my god the fucking ad-read / amazingly hilarious comedy 🤣
It's been 2-3 days. I am watching her vids. I love this girl. ❤✨
You deserve it ! ❤️ congratulations 🥳
Hah my parents kicked me out when I was 15🤣 I want to be you😭
Your outfit in this video is actually really cute
She is feeling the unbridled joy of buying a house with her own money which is a feeling that most millienials will never feel. I will happily feel it through her.
Do you have any advice for other people who are learning how to be savers and want to save for a house? I would love to see a video on this - your story is inspiring and I love your energy! ❤
e g g
I freaking love that bird😀😀😀❤️
This channel is so real and wholesome 💕
that’s SO amazing!!!! i love your content it’s great that you’re so pleased with this house! i hope you continue to have fun with your channel
tewers
Congratulations! But oh to live in a place where it is feasible to buy a house in cash!   I live in Sydney and just bought a house. Happy with it, but unfortunately it’s not possible to buy a house here in cash unless you’re a multi-millionaire. So mortgage it is for me :p
Why do you actually make sponsors watchable and k love how your so unique
Omg.. u r so entertaining
You deserve it girl!
Awww you look so happy! This video brought me joy
What state is that? Congratulations on your house
My mom kicked me out and it was hard. So if you can stay at your parents home long enough, do it!
The best ad I’ve ever seen
Girl, I relate to you so much. I am now 23 and just moved in with roomates last year. For pretty much the same reasons, I did not want to deal with debt. I wanted to save my money. Bravo girl.
Help hopescope!!!
WHY HAVE I NOT SEEN THIS VIDEO 11 MONTHS LATER
Congratulations on your first home!
OMG I JUST REALIZED THIS VIDEO IS 14 MINS LONG AND SHE WANTED THE OTHER VID TO BE 14 MINS LONG
ngl i think i live on bleep street                                                                            (im joking)

Hahaha my dad asked about dippy eggs too!!!
I'm 30 moved out 2 yrs ago after I was able to buy a tiny condo. Worth it.
the fact that i'm 14 and i'm too obsessed with zillow-
Wait!  Aren't you a vegetarian and you have a deer head on your wall?
i drink cake
Im soo happy for you. You have grown so much!!
Best reenactment of Titanic ever
Me binge watching your videos…. I was supposed to go to sleep at 8. It’s 10:30. Now I’m mad at you. But also you’re house is awesome! And your channel!
Comedy gold
Omg I am dying laughing to the point of tears but also so happy for you that you got such a beautiful home!!!!!!!!
I think I’m just going to bought those lashes to make my own “titanic” version
fear of loans and debt IS real. I don't even know why I have it, I just like being in control of my finances and I can't really be in control when I'm giving the bank my left kidney which costs twice as much as the loan I'd get if I actually were to get one, because you know, interest and Maths and things like that. yeah, debt is bad.
She did it. I just realized it, but she did it.                 She made her video exactly 14 minutes!!
Congratulations 👏🎉👏 you should do a one year later tour!!!
I’m happy with you !!!!
You do deserve this !!!
Wow I’m so happy for you! I live with my parents right now because I live in NYC where it’s expensive af and I just have no interest in working obsessively just to rent a room. I can work obsessively to build my dream in my parents house comfortably. I’m leaving once I can get my own house.
Lol this is my first time finding your channel and you are hilarious. I rlly enjoy your personality!
That part when she went through that one part of the house with her socks and over sized shirt, Grant Gustin (Barry Allen, or The Flash) vibes😂
Wait, I just realized that Micarah said this in the video: 'I know I don't deserve this.' Well, you see, you worked hard on these videos and advertisers paid handsomely for the views your videos attracted. That sounds to me, like, you know, a JOB. So what's wrong with spending the money you earn from doing something really well? Nothing! You deserve this, that's all I'm saying ...
I’m so happy for you and I can’t prove to you that im not the creepy one but i would love to have tea with you in this gorgeous house hahaha stay safe and congratulations 🤍 ps. We need a tour or makeover or such things please ✨
Btw Ther is one second more then 14:00
This is the only channel where I actually watch the sponsors because it’s so entertaining watching her explain it
❤
This video makes me genuinely happy
fuck I'm crying you're living my dream. good for you, you beautiful soul
How did she make a mini SNL comic show from magnetic lashes?!
Take my money. She’s so funny and talented. Like a YouTube version of Margot Robbie
You do deserve this, Micarah💕
Don't put your shoes on your couch. Oh my god! It's dirty.
This made me want a regular house 🥺♥️ That house looks special I love seeing your excitement
Fun fact I read “omw” as “oh my wow” every time
You're so happy in this video it makes me happy :D
Lol! Congrats! You've earned every inch of that house!
I swear she makes sponserships so intresting to watch even though they have nothing to do with the actual video
aw it’s so emotional, im very happy for you :) you’ve worked for this and you deserve it! you’re one of the sweetest and most genuine youtubers i’ve ever come across and it’s heart-warming to see you grow
Love how frugal you are!!
I am extremely proud to say that I OWN THE SAME SWEATER THAT SHE WORE IN THE THUMBNAIL
Parabéns pela casa, você merece ❤
YAY
Mortgage means Death Gate.... You have good discernment Micarah. 👍
I'm middle aged and angry/despondent about the state of this patriarchy. I'm so revolted by the stalking of YouTubers/Any Person Who Identifies As Female On Line, and the absolute lack of care or repercussions for these entitled people who think they deserve someone else's attention. I so very much hope you are safe and getting support for the insane distress these people create. I'm so sorry I didn't fight hard enough to fix it before you became famous. I'm thrilled you have financial freedom.  Buy cameras. Install them yourself. Monitor them on your phone. You've got this. Stay safe. Well done you.
“I don’t deserve this” You do, you made dope ass youtube videos that make... lets see... yep almost 2 million people happy. Also you made a bunch of people take up sowing and that’s priceless. As a humble subscriber, I’m super happy you were able to buy a house
7:05 I love that throwback to when she drove a car through a river
okay but like you totally deserve it
This is house.... is... absolutely stunning, how DARE you steal it from me.
❤️
Congratulations on the house and getting the video to be exactly 14:00 minutes long!
Ok when you were talking about putting a wig on a dead deer the knocking sounded like someone was knocking on my wall-
i dont believe in sidewalks either! twinz.
She’s so happy Now I’m so happy  Her happiness is infectious
"Exactly 14 minutes" ****14:01****
In my culture kids don't move out. Parents live with their son or sons and daughters live with parents until marriage so yeah it's normal but I'd love to move out one day. Already started saving up!
its sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo sweeet so happy for you
I want a beautiful 2 bedroom house?
The creepy one's 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Am I the only one who thought she said I bought a mouse 🐭 🌝 BYE-
I think avoiding debt is very rational....congratulations!!
I am def guilty of scrolling zillow... a lot.
Awee how to be you po!! I'm a new subscriber and have been binging your videos ever since. You are an amazing, magnificent (all the other synonyms of amazing) person and you are literally my goals! Love all the way from the Philippines😘🤗
"All the letters are right next to each other" had me cackling
Thats the most YouTube thumbnail I've seen on this channel
WHAT IS YOUR JOB?!
Congrats Angel xxx
Just realized something: if I put Micarah's clip on 0.75 speed she sounds normal 😅🤔
Ah man people are really doing that to you??? I’m sorry Micarah, you shouldn’t have to put up with people invading your privacy. I hope it’s ceased and the crazies are leaving you alone. ☹️
In most latinoamerican countries we stay in our parents house until we get married.
This is the best news ever!!!!!!
1:35 this is the exact same way I ended up buying a house: my zillow addiction.
Her happiness makes me Happy😍 I aspire to be her!
Regency and Victorian tea parties yes Btw: YOU TOTALLY DESERVE IT
i’m sorry you dress up WHAT?
“Ya a Little…you believe in reincarnation??”😂💀
13:46
As an artistic scatterbrained woman who has sacrificed a cool satisfying life of 54 years for a straight gig in healthcare administration so I could have a home, car, health insurance, utilities and clothing for my husband and children, I applaud you as loudly as an entire crowd of WinterJam fans stuffed in a ginormadone with not a one fan wearing even one glove or mitten. You are fierce and fabulous!
IMMMM SOOO HAPPY FOR YOUU ILYYYYY SM
I love how the video ends when you stub your toe
Hey dad is the true joy of this video
I LOVE that thumb nail
i love how wholesome & happy you are about this house :) CONGRADULATIONS!!!!
11:23
:( I liked when u were in a trailer plus u were funnier but congrats
Guys, make sure to not show pictures of your keys. They can be replicated using photos!💜💜💜
Do you know what each room on the first floor was used for originally?
I love how she looks like Sabrina spellman
Finally, someone else who doesn't believe in sidewalks.  May you remain protected in a super safe bubble of safety that no weirdos can ever bite into, forever and ever achoo.
I can’t wait to see the updates on the house
This is so inspiring
This video is now the reason why your my favorite youtuber. I just love how quirky you are and that you're unabashedly yourself. I'm happy you're happy.
I'm so happy for you I watched it twice with all the ads
Just because other people really deserve houses too, even if they have worked longer than you, or more physically demanding jobs, etc - that doesn't mean that you are any less deserving - If they got that house, they would be happy about it, and I think that feeling bad about what you have won't serve any good, especially if you love those things!
i would actually sit through micarah's ad's bc of how funny she makes them
when i clicked the video i thought the title was "I BOUGHT A HORSE"
Being scared of loans and debt is 100% valid I’m literally twrrified
That house is gorgeous, actually my dream house
I’m not gonna lie I thought you rote “I bought a mouse” soooooooo
I feel the same way about debt or loans. I have vowed to never be in debt.
You picked an outfit to match your sentence aahahaah
You got it at 14:00 this time!!
Clap clap :)
The game is fun 🤩 the game is fun 🤩 🐶🤩🦩🐂🐃🦬🦘🦒💜🦀🐧👎🏻👊🦗🍓🍉🐹🐻‍❄️🐷🐢🦊🤩🤬🤖
i appreciate that your dads concern with that letter was you believing in reincarnation
Congratulations!!!!!  And soooo sorry about the creepy peoples, that sucks! :(:( I will pray for you so it can get better if you wish it.!:)
MICARAH SWEETIE HOW CAN YOU THINK YOU DONT DESERVE THIS YOU DESERVE THE WHOLE WORLD
Tewers
Plz pin this your my fav you tuber
Whatever Glamnetic is paying you, it isn't enough.
American houses are so cheap, beautiful and spacious, our UK houses are overpriced and unless you're rich small and claustrophobic sigh.
Live is alot easier when you refuse to go into debt.
Grrrrrrrrrrllllllll!!!!! Congrats! (5 months later)  you are so damn talented! Personality! Smarts! Wit and Gorgeous FABULOCITY!!!! Grrrrrrrrrrllllllll it takes a lot to make me laugh and keep my attention for longer than a second, thank you!  I will stop by complimenting you at this point ,or else you'll expect it at every damn video. Toodles!❤️🦙🦄🐇🧚
I moved out when I was 18 and haven’t looked back. I encourage everyone to do that same!!  There are a plethora of reasons to move out of your parents house EARLY. And go to college!!!!! It’s bathe best thing you can do for yourself!!
We have the same skirt ❤️❤️❤️ I love that skirt
I'm so happy for you!!!🥰
Your pose at 13:42 could be use for an album cover, Your that perfect!!🤩
I also drink cake Micarah, you are not alone
I love how happy you are about the house  . . .  It kinda makes me happy as well :)
I love this so much aaaaa  Also “I don’t know which of you are the creepy ones” LMAO glad you’re keeping yourself safe Micarah! A very belated congratulations to you!!
For real that's a really nice house. I don't have need for so many rooms but I would still totally live in it. Congratulations on your new home! 😊🏡😍
"I am very particular about which laws I break"😂😂priceless!
Zillow is very addictive.  I've already bought a house.. sold that house..  bought another house AND I still look at Zillow
WE NEED A HOUSE TOUR
You made an entire costume just to say you wanted an older house.
Everytime I watch one of her videos im stuck by her beauty. like shes literally a barbie. dang.  Also the whole stalking thing is very concerning.
dont you have an rv
Yasssssssss beautiful
You look like Taylor swift just a little! Love your channel
Terwers
"I've literally, actually, never gone to two bathrooms at the same time." No way!!! Me neither.
My parents even told me and my siblings that they wants us to stay with them until we think we’re ready to live independently
11:36 she is literally a disney princess at this point
they should pay u double for the titanic scene bruh
please make  a video about you decorating your house  PlEaSe
I WAS JUST IN OHIO
When the sponsorship part is so entertaining that you forget what the video is about lmao
Girl, everybody deserves a home, including you!  You even picked a modestly sizable home ❤️
This is the most mid west thing ever ❤️
I thought she lived in an RV
So happy for u, u deserve it xx
I'm not a creepy one please invite me!!
Awe gosh this is so sweet! Good for you!!!!
Comgrats on the house. Im the same way too about debt or mortgage.
She's so happy!!!!! It's contagious.<3<3
I love your vids, you are so funny 😂  Just Suscribed 😊
you know why she is in possession of 17 diamonds?? ... BECAUSE SHE IS GETTING MARRIED AND IT IS PROBABLY ON HER WEDDING RING!!! Mystery solved
The happiness she gets when she’s exploring the house hits hard
Congratulations  girl I'm 30 living in FL got my first house last month paid in c ash, feel so happy for myself and my achievements so far watching this random video. So glad I made good decisions about my finances that changed me forever
Your so pretty
I'd like to visit, but I'm one of the creepy people who believes in sidewalks, so don't invite me.  Congratulations, anyway!  I think a fear of debt is entirely rational, but maybe that's confirmation that I'm extra creepy.  However, I wouldn't turn down an invitation to see your house ... unless I might turn it down.
Congrats 🌹🌹🌹🌹❤️
i am a kid-…
This is the most wholesome video I have ever seen.
you deserve it all...u probably have no idea about the fact of how happy u make me and all of us watching ur videos.... everything in them is so entertaining even ur paid promotion parts are.....ilysm...CONGRATULATIONS ON THE HOUSE
Girl you should've  made a room to do MESSY stuff like art or make dresses and then on room for storage  or chill room I don't remember if u had 3 bed rooms but the 3rd on for your room
I ran across your Instagram when 5hensmo mentioned you on her Instagram.  You are absolutely adorable.  I am a grandmother of four granddarlings - all under age 12...just letting you know I'm not a stalker.  But, I really laughed out loud watching your House video - which is the only video of yours I have watched.  Welcome to home ownership.  It is mah-ve-lous at any age.  Congrats.  P.S.  I really enjoyed your humor!
Congrats! Make more video please❤️❤️❤️my 3rd time to watch this
hi i know this is kind of late and you probably won’t see this but i love you and your channel and i would love a full house tour and to see all of the things that you have done so far! ❤️
Im legit so happy that you bought a house.  I was kind of hoping that you would buy one when I found out you had been making dresses almost bigger than you in a Camper van.  Also love your videos and fashion sense
This video is like the definition of happy, pure joy.
😍😍😍😍😍♥️♥️♥️♥️ I love you so much.
THUMBS UP FOR REGENCY TEA PARTIES.
Houses in the US are so spacious! Houses of that size in UK would be mega bucks! X Lovely home:) x
You look like you are gonna start speaking brit accent out of the blue....whole video i was like now now nowwww bishhh 😂❤️
The fact that you said everyone should live woth their parents as long as they want, really resonates with me. I have moved out TWICE, but each time I moved back. Now, I live for free in my parent's second house ❤️ (They live on a farm, "my" house is basically a cabin in the woods)
This is so amazing! Congratulations on your beautiful new home!!!
Congratulations!!!
I'm dyinggg
You are so lovelyy! Your words and excitement always brightens me up! And omg the energy and creativity you put into the editing its AMAZIINGG! Always waiting for more and more videos from you :D
Of course you deserve it. No hate to you!! but that’s a dumb thing to say. Nothing grudgy but I feel like you might’ve have your tough share of life and to speak real, who deserves what. I’l glad for you and can’t WAIT to 😮😍🤩 on your house renovations projects videos ❤️💜
Having a closet inside your closet is a longlife dream
Formula claims voice actress nice 👍🏼👌🏼👏 😎
You're too hysterical!!!!
The house WAS made before 1910s.
I think you put your hand in our rental property. It’s okay.
What if I told you my parents sold that house to you.
I am so happy for you!!!! And you TOTALLY deserve this!!
MICARAH YOU DESERVE THIS HOUSE SO BAD IT HURTS. You're one of my favourite people on this whole entire planet earth. I'm literally 16 but I'm literally so proud of you💖
1:28 jesus I thought somebody was knocking outside my window I got so scared
I too am house haunting. I know the struggle and excitement. This is the second video of yours that I’ve seen. Love the editing and content and I too tell dad jokes.
“I know I don’t deserve this” what kind of crazy talk is that! Yes you had a few things going for you that made it easier but you have poured your heart and soul into these videos for years. It’s no different than making a TV show. You’ve earned this.
It’s really cool that you acknowledged not everyone has the privilege to live at home with their parents until they’re financially stable. It doesn’t take away from how hard you’ve worked for this but it is true it’s really hard to stay debt free or save money when you don’t have a support network.
so so happpppppppppppppppppppppppppppppyyyyy you should be proud of yourself <3
You are literally so precious, creative, and hiliarious! You deserve your house! Thank you for your inspiring videos! :-D
you deserve it! but check in on your dad and the duckies <3
Congratulations for the House, Micarah!!!! It looks lovely!!!!
You really deserve the house!
any one know where i can fint that sound effect at 3:15? she cheering cround one
When you said there all next to each other I had to exit the vid and go to the search just to figure out that they are not to each other
offend my great great grand ma
Your happy and I love it
no one does paid promotions better than you
But you do deserve it!! Your personality and creativity is unimaginable. Also you are freaking pretty, i cannot stop staring at you lol😂❤️❤️
I'm not a creep (I think...) But I can totally understand sum1 getting obsessed with you to the point of stalking, you have a magnetic absolutely loveable personality. I think all your fans wish they could be your best friend (or fiancé!) Good to know that your new house will give you the safety you need and the happiness you deserve 😉
were those animal thingies actually real
So happy for you! As I see so many youtubers buying big houses, I feel a little sad as we had to sell our house thanks to the crisis
Her: Then I went to my home My computer: Let's put a Disneyland ad right here... Disneyland: MY HOMEEEEEE
this is so wholesome. im so happy for you and YOUR NEW HOUSE!!!! :D
awww good for her
She one person huge house  Me 3 people tiny house
Beautiful house! Good luck!!
Oh my gosh I love your videos. New girl crush? 😭
12:37 I can gladly say I lived in iraq in my childhood and you reminded me of it … good day’s 😌
I got too dragged into the advertisement that I forgot this video is about house tour lmao
So now she has a house and 2 RVs.
I'm happy of you
I love you and I am gay😭
I am soooo happy for you!!
Ik im too but many people don’t know yet she is engaged to her school bf his name is joey
Please dress up as Bell form beauty in the beast I think it would be beautiful
Just a question. When you are settled in (moved in fully, renovated and all those stuff) can you give us the grand tour of your new house? (ik it's a stupid question and it's obvious that you will but just to comment)
Lol this is the first I've EVER enjoyed a spiel to sell absolutely anything. I even want the lashes more just because of the totally awesome personality they were displayed alongside of.
Wholesomeness
"and reason number W."
This is the most chaotic house tour I've ever seen
Congratsssssss, good for you!!!
Yooo I didn’t know she lived in Ohio. My brother goes to college there
I love the pure joy on her face
She's the only youtuber where I don't skip the sponsored parts
Wicked way cool man, I mean girl…I mean lady…person…human. Cool eh.
Are the 17 diamonds the amount of diamonds on your engagement ring??
I loveeee the backslash in the kitchen. Can't wait to get a bigger home one day to.
The bird just comes to her as she wakes up like cinderella PS keep that rolled up rug if you stain the carpet you can just cut it out and cut out a new piece with that rug
I felt the egg part
BEING A VIRGIN IS COOL VERY RESPECT MUCH ADMIRATION
14 minutes.
I would just like to say that I LOVE your house
I love this so so much!! So so happy for you 💗💛💗
DUDE MY DADS NAME IS WILLIAM MARK
I can listen to this woman all day long!
CONGRATULATIONS!!!
I dont cook, But for some reason I love  celebrities kitchens

You never think grass will be wet in the morning... but it dew
man she was so excited about her house I got excited abt MY potential future house.. also the inviting people over part reminds me so much of Taylor swift yayayayqa
I LOVE U for that Titanic thing I LOVE IT and I LOVE the movie l know ALL the lines to the movie and know to much about it
how the hell do u train ur bird
Your videos are completely delightful to watch, so thanks for that (:
CONGRATS, LOVE!!! I’ve been watching your channel since the beginning. So amazing to see how for you’ve come 👏 🐓  🦢 🦔 🏠
She is so different from everyone else on Youtube. She seems so nice and down to earth, even tho she´s incredibly talented and hilarious. I´m honestly so entertained by her videos and with every video i´m watching I wanna start sewing and be creative. So inspiring. Love it!
its a good thing the lashes are latex free because i'm alergic
I actually bought the lashes!!! 🤩
2 yrs later and I haven't finished  that vid
how did you train your bird to fly to you?!
this video made me cry, i’m so so happy for u. it’s my dream to have a house that i love one day, can’t wait to experience the same happiness :)
I'm 10000000% convinced you also came up with the commercials for purple mattress because it's the only advertisement as entertaining as yours.
I like how she supports people living with their parents if that arrangement works for everyone!  People are so judgmental of that for some reason.  IDK, I would totally be fine with my children living with me until they were financially ready to move out.  One of the biggest reasons I was drawn to this channel was because she likes to do things her own way and she is unapologetic about it.  She is an awesome role model, even if she is only one year older than me! 😂
Hey micarah, I highly doubt your going to see this but me and my dad love your videos and we always watch them together and it’s been a amazing bonding experience. But I’ve been trying to convince him to get a kitten for 3 years now and if you could just help me give him a gentle nudge into agreeing into one of your videos it would mean the world to me. You have such Beautiful relationships with your pet bird and I aspire to be like that with this kitten. From your number 1 fan
No she didn't bring Titanic in to this 🤣🤣🤣. Laughed so hard my stomach hurts .
Where did you buy a $40 couch?!?
Omg I am sooo happy for you ❤
"i don't believe in sidewalks"-Micharah Tewers 8th of march 2021
aaah congrats bestie!! AND YOU DEFINITELY DESERVE ITTTT 🤍🤍🤍
Her i got a rack ME SHE HAS THE SAME RACK AS ME
Oh also not creepy. Just a 23 yo that lives in Ohio and wants more cool people to hang with
Oh well I break that law every time I wen to look at apartments and houses in the past 6 years lmao oops 😬 btw I’m from Ohio if that didn’t click with the law they have about pics and vids of places you’re going to buy or if it’s also applies to renting
Oh my goodness I’m so over the moon for you! This is so exciting & YES you deserve it! Also just bought some glamnetic lashes to try using your code!! ✨✨
Your Dad is fabulous ... "maybe the part about reincarnation"  hahaha .. He is just  so calm ...
YOU DID NOT PUT A WIG ON A DEAD DEER MICARAH
seeing her this happy about the house, gives me so much happiness
Congratulations 🎊🍾🎉
please make a dress out of aluminum foil
This is where harry potter will sleep when he comes to visit HAHAHAHA
It makes me really happy seeing how happy she looks in that house
im so happy for you Micarah! and also im sorry that people were stalking your other house :( ill keep you in my prayers
Ok i've been binging Micarah's videos since yesterday when i first found out about her channel.. but one thing i've noticed is how she looks literally identical to Xepher Wolf. Like it's kinda uncanny, especially right here : 3:16 on the right.
It's very heartwarming and comedic at the same time
It's very heartwarming and comedic at the same time
This. This was amazing!
Also... I just bought a Class A Motorhome after seeing all your sewing videos. the plan is a Mobile Sewing Shop!  Still need to come up with an AWESOME name for it!
HOLY CRAP!!!!  IM SEW EXCITED FOR YOU!!!!
I have a hard time keeping the liner actually ON my lips.  it just peels off. :(
Aww! she's so HAPPY!!! I'm happy for you Micarah!!! <3
Omg i need the lashed, but im broke....
You pouring whipped cream into your mouth from the bottle is something I dream about. And I lucid dream.
Congratulations!!! But I cannot get over the last part 🤣🤣
6:29 You are a model 😍
The adhesive porch nomenclaturally vanish because ex-wife visually expand at a gainful caption. uneven, unused yacht
PLEASE MAKE A DRESS FROM THE NEW MOVIE CRUELLA
Micarah is being sus... She said “ one and a half humans” referring to herself, and called her dad “ grandpa”.... hmmmmm
Congratulations 🎊🎉🍾🎈. So beautiful 🤩
I don't seem to blink when I watch her videos 😳💛
6:44
now THIS IS how you do a sponsorship cough cough
THANK YOU FOR MAKING ME FEEL BETTER ABOUT MY OWN IRRATIONAL FEAR OF GOING BROKE 😭😭😭😭😭
Can you create a dress from the Cruella movie?
I'm sorry, the cop recommended WHAT lmao edit: but wait, how much was the house? I've been on a zillow binge too lol
Congratulations on owning a house! I watch your spastic videos because you are filled with creativity and truly adore what you're doing. You have all the energy a 24 year old should have but with a sense of purpose. You are a true role model to your generation. Enjoy tinkering in your old house & keep those creepy internet trolls far away. Which reminds me, my favorite program when I was 24 was This Old House. Love the dude with the beard
Okay. Let me paint you a story.   I watched your most recent "I DIYd My Summer Wardrobe" video. I expected the usual DIY video... but I got you. I was most happy with this stumble upon, because I too grew up in a small town in Ohio and grew an unhealthy unease for the Amish. However, I now live in Pennsylvania... where the Amish are more abundant and I can confirm - some of them do smile. So I went back and watched all of your videos from the beginning, so I could know to whom, exactly, I was subscribing. I do this often.   Regardless.... watching THIS video made my heart swell with joy, as I genuinely love seeing other people's happiness. I. Am. So. Happy. For. You. You are a beautiful soul.   I won't lie. The fact that you name dropped religion in a lot of your videos almost turned me off... I grew up very religious, and because of that I'm pretty jaded toward most religious people. But woman, you have a true heart of gold, and make me proud (?) of what religion SHOULD be about.   Just. Thank you. You're awesome. And I love your content. Also.... creepy people - stop being creepy!
Zillow are Renders (computer generated images furniture light colors and spaces are fake)
You super deserve it :)
The only ad I’ve ever watched all the way through
Love ❤️ her sense of humor!! But she is giving you kids in your 20’s VERY GOOD ADVICE!!!🥰  yes I’m old. Sorry.
I love how she spends the whole video blocking images and photos of her house out just to show it in whole during the tour video
This made me so happy 😭😭😭
Omg i adore this girl im so happy I came across her! I'm a tall chick to I love knowing there's fellow tall girls lol your dad incessantly offering you scrambled eggs is hilarious.
😂😂
I’m so happy for you oh my goodness!!!
LET’S SEE SOME RENO VIDEOS!!!! So excited!!!
Pls a makeup tutorial pls plsssss those lashes ughhhhh pls
Okay, but she didn't need to call out us coulrophobes :(      (twas a joke)
Normally, I don't watch videos of people talking but for you an exception was made. I couldn't stop smiling for you
A hardy congratulations on your purchasing of a building made a long time ago just for you! 🌟 I too bought my 1st house last year so we’re basically the same. Except I’m 40 and you are...not? I think. Since we are the same and all I don’t have to tell you what a joy it is to walk into your sewing room (or any other room but really holy bleeping bleeps I have a sewing room!) and expound on your love for your old house. Like I just wake up & walk into my vintage kitchen and get those heart flutters like I did when I was a teenager in lerv with a very stupid boy. For realz tho my kitchen has an ironing board in the wall and it even has a sleeve ironing board in there too! 🤯😱😍 We have decided that the mother & father of our house who gave birth to her in 1950 were Sherman & Betsy Ann. Sherman did all these amazing things to this house that make so much sense & makes me seriously concerned about why we’ve stopped making houses like this. (I’m 40 so I get to worry about these things & stuff like inflation which also gives me thoughts like why would anyone pay more that $5 for shoes when there are so many at the thrift store but again we’re of course the same so I don’t have to tell you about my passion (obsession?) for thrift stores.) Its sexist to assume it was Sherman but let’s be real here. Can I just add that on my list of things I wanted in a house was a laundry shoot? Those who things are pure gold. So anyways I wanted to thank you for my invitation to your regency ball & Edwardian tea that I will pretend are in the mail. You’re invited to my garb-b-q but you don’t know where I live so maybe you should have one of those too. Also 🙌🏼 team Historical Sewing with ADHD! 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼💃🏼 #overrelating
ALSO i love your attitude and overall personality, it's so good to see someone so genuinely and purely happy over they're achievements; big or small. I hope that someday I can muster the bravery you exhibit but for now I canNOT WAIT to see how you renovate this beautiful house! You're so inspirational!!
OMG CAN YOU LIKE TEACH me how to make turtle necks?? I LOVE them but can't sew for shit so please save me mother micarah
Ok but Micarah moving into any small patch of sunlight reminds me of me obsessively moving my tomato plants into the sun all the time.
That house is so nice
I am so sorry that men are so creepy and you had to move! Like this video is funny and all, but that shit is scary.
I just get over how similar our living situations are/has been . I used to live in a RV with my husband in the Netherlands and since like 2 weeks ago we also moved into a house .  Love your stuff ! Xxx
Congrats Micarah!!!!!!!!
New series!!!!!
with all the titanic references i can assume we’re gonna get a titanic vid
i thought the nails were going to be magnetic too 💀
Your house is SO PRETTY!!! 😍😍
Not even gonna lie I relate so hard to this woman lol
It’s beautiful congrats!
Most relatable sentence: "I'm really skilled at forgetting what I was supposed to be talking about"
you do deserve this!! can you do a house tour when ur finished decorating
........ESPETACULAR......MARAVILHOSA......INCRÍVEL.......
Show the finished house
Micarah: didn't go to college bcs fear of debt Me, double degree in foreign language and arts & craft: what can I say I'm a masochist 😎
Nahh gurl u deserve this! U don't know how much you made me happy by just being you. I am legit happy for you!
can i come over? i'm good kind of creepy like you
I almost cried seeing Micarah this happy. Congratulations and best of luck!
I love all her jokes and her
What a cutie
This was the only time I didn’t skip though the sponsor
just a responsible young adult passing through to say DONT GOT TO PEOPLES HOUSES UNIVITED! k cya
I can't get over how cute the thumbnail is like why can't I look like that...
That house just fits Micarah.  I can’t explain
Ok but you ABSOLUTELY deserve this. You’ve worked your ass off to give us all of your wonderful random energy via the internet and you got yourself a thing!!!!
Congrats on the new house! I'm new to the channel, so is your bird's name in reference to the Belgariad?
Congrats!!!Soo proud :)
on words "i know i don't deserve this..." i started crying.... you do, i love you
It took less time than the length of this video to confirm the address...
😍😍😍😍😍 congratsssss omg
You deserve it!!!
congrats <3 you deserve all the best!
This was so cute it made me cry😭 💖 I can't wait to grow up and have my own house🤧
just wondering if the chickens will move in
you do deserve this
What are you going to do with RV's? If you're selling them I will seriously make an offer. I will do anything to not have to pay to live on campus for the next 2 years 🙃😄
wow its so pretty!
U need MORE THAN 1 million subscribers u NEED LIKE 10 million 😭😭🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
.
I MISS YOU!
Fucka mortgage you have a good investment guys and gals pay attention.
Congrats!!!
Aw, good luck!!!
This woman is as good at writing sponsorship bits as Sam Riegel and that is SAYING SOMETHING.
In your last video I literally just thought you went into someone's random house to film your reveal and didn't question it for a second!!!! LOL!!!!! 😂
Awwww this was so sweet!!! I love seeing people being happy!!! ☺️
Congrats!  Make more videos.  We are proud of you.
I stopped watching tv like 25 years ago because of commercials. But I would seriously watch an entire show of just Micarah doing random commercials.
You look soooo much like Jessica Alba
Aaaaahhh!! I just got it. 17 diamonds. SHES ENGAGED! Congrats! 🤩🤩🤩
you should totally recreate the costumes from La belle et la Bete! They are absolutely breathtaking!
Can you give a tour when your house is fully renovated?
Fun fact: only 15% of people understand what she means when she talks...lol!
Me: *gets and add* Add: I am house add
Congratulations!
I’m obsessed with looking at houses online , lol.  Trulia and Redfin are my jam..  It kills me that people don’t stage their houses.
Great Job! Very happy for you. I have always enjoyed your videos, so great and exactly how my Adhd brain works. I don't know any thing about measurements, I just eye that shit out too. I get you girl! Good for you on the house. I hope every thing goes up from here. <3 <--- I don't know how to use emojis on youtube.
Your fear of debt is NOT irrational. And I wish I had that fear.
Wait until that first party comes and you only have one bathrom!!!
"Then it dawned on me."  LOLed.
I never wear eyelashes; why was I so tempted to buy them xD
you showed the front of the house in the thumb nail. what are the karens gana think
The titanic skit has me dead 🤣🤣🤣💀💀 I must be Jack here🤣🤣😜🤪
That is wonderful and awesome!!! Also, I wanna be your friend 😊💕lol
Wow IT nice And funny👍👍👍👍
Congratulation 🎊 🎊 🎊
I somewhat expect a white room dedicated to painting different types of murals like what Drew Barrymore did in 50 first dates
Congratulations, and yes, Zillow is addicting. I love your videos.
I miss you my dear hopefully you are okay
Your excitement is so real! I’m happy for you and I love your house already 💓
You've redeemed YouTube. You deserve everything. Holy crap, prolifically creative.
In Asian culture, kids ideally only leave when they get married (some well into their 30s), and some don’t even leave even then (which is wrong, methinks). So there’s absolutely no shame in that!!
I can’t wait to see what you do with the place !!! I know you will give it that unique Micarah touch !!!! Do you know how hard it is to type your name on my iPhone? It just kept fixing it lol
Congrats queen ❤️
that fireplace looks like the one in Coraline 😳
ITS SO GORGEOUS!!
Your house is bigger then mine and I live in ohio with 6 family members lol
This was the very first video I saw by her and I never finished it. I ended up going and watching like 10 of her other videos because I was enamored with the way she talks! It's so fast and she says the craziest, funniest stuff! Anyway, just came back to this video after about 2 weeks to finally watch the rest. So glad she got a house. You can tell it means a lot to her, as it should. Congrats!
Scientists have found ways to install extra bathrooms in one-bathroom houses making them two-bathroom houses.
Wow I liked the add better then the video
love u micarah <3
5:44 I'm really worried now, girl!
And i just went into escrow 2 days ago!!!! 28  days to go!!! Should I make a video. Not...
"Shocked Face"  YOU'vE seen Risky Business? lol
Omg I love her heels!!
She is so gorgeous. Why was i born so ugly 😭😭😭
Just wanted to say.., the input of your Dad, with just that lil bit of Spiritual guidance..., is PRICELESS...I recognize  it in your  Character.., never lose it...luv ya gurl...!!!
Congratulations on your house! Love your videos you are always entertaining can’t wait to see what you create next 😀
Why so flex on leaving parents house n getting a house we Indians literally spend whole life with parents in parents house 😎
That's literally the only sponsored ad I've sat through in a long time
I’m vegan
Micarah and you’re a little woman ranting video you said that you love the one made in 1948 but in this video you said that anything made past 1910 is tacky...😂😂😂😂
please do a video when you are gonna do a makeover on one of the rooms!!!
I don't believe in side walks 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Able to host regency tea parties! We have a mutual house goal <3 but I am not there yet. Also able to host a Regency banquet and ball.
Congrats on your purchase!!
Ah! I'm so excited for you!
Comment number 12,001 I love your house. I am creepy. No, I wont come over.
Love you... But NO pink!
I watched the ad before this video❤️❤️
I hope glamnetic paid for the house because this is the best sponsored video ever.
Micarah talking about her “irrational” fear of debt made me feel so included... because I have the exact same fear. Legit that’s why I joined the Air Force to pay for college because of my fear of debt.
you're so adorable  <3. - if you ever need a next ex-husband, please call me!!!!
congratulationsssssssss
During the ad I forgot what i was actually watching and just thought to myself I need to go to glamnetic and buy something, anything really and then the house video was back on and all i could think of was, damn what a good job you did.... EVERYONE SHOULD SPONSER YOU
I love the thumbnail it looks like a professional photographer took it
As someone who has debt and a fear of clowns - I feel personally attacked.
OMG I JUST HAD THIS SHINING IDEA IN MY HEAD SHE *NEEDS TO MAKE THE OUTFITS FROM MELANIE MARTINEZ'S K-12 PLZ COPY AND PASTE THIS PLZ WE NEED TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN
Cool
You have been a huge blessing to many of us, so I really believe you deserve this! Don't sell yourself short, you're God's amazing creation! Stay safe ☺️
also, please have a tea party
how did you learn to sew dresses?
My desire of owning my own cabin in the woods just became HUGE. Doesn't matter I love where I live, I have the nicest flatmate and cat and the garden is huge. I want a place to live that is MINE.
where is her chicken
"Let me have my fear."
People talkin bout those 17 diamonds and confirming that she’s worthy of the home. I just can’t get over the $40 couch! I had to rewind to be sure I heard her correctly.$40?!?! What a great find!
I have to admit I got a bit teary-eyed, Micarah.  I'm so happy for you!  Seeing the pure joy on your face fills me with joy.  You 100% deserve that house, and you inspire me to be more fully myself by being so unapologetically you.  It's seriously a beautiful thing. </3
I love how the add for this video is the same in the video
i dont wear lashes but now im sold.
I GOT A LASH AD ON THIS VIDEO AND I GENUINELY THOUGHT THAT IT WAS THE NORMAL VIDEO AKXJWJDJWJDJJWJFJD
❤️omg queen u so beautiful.
how awesome! I look forward to all your Micarah's house shenanigans. high five! sorry, i don't know how to access the emoji's on this computer.
Now im waiting for the “my house is haunted” video...
I'm just refreshing again and again the page till she gets the 2M subs she deserves.
I wish Micarah would do a like home ma over vid I love her so much and that would be soooo cute x

this gal is about the only youtuber that can make me watch a long ass promotion all the way through
I bet she is going to make a dress out of that extra carpet.
Congratulations
CONGRATS!
I was watching your brother's video earlier today and in it you talked about how you dressed up a deer. And then you mentioned it in this one and I was so shocked. It was so bizarre because that video was posted over a year ago and then you mention it here.
The inexpensive ikebana curiosly crawl because fly socioeconomically interrupt underneath a magnificent oxygen. like, cultured india
I don’t wear lashes but I fr just watched the whole ad without skipping 😀
Ahhhh, you showed too much of your house. I recommend wayze or however you spell it cameras for the outside
Im so happy for you, well done! And dont let anyone tell you, you do not deserve this. Even your self
Omgggg i looove you micarah 🤣🤩
11:38 Cinderella is that you
Actually that's not how a semicolon is used... That's just your way of pretending menopause isn't coming
u deserve this !!!!
Congratulations
Second video...omg dead!! You are hilarious!! an humid succes!!
"Insecure of normalcy" I have no problem whatsoever clowns you do you! But I do have a problem when they eat children....nightmares...IT..ugh!
OMG SO HAPPY FOR YOU YOUR HOUSE IS SO PRETTY <3
My mother used to make me "dippin" eggs!
Your happiness is so contagious, I'm so happy for you. I teared up when i saw how happy you were in the end. Nothing like making a place your home.
happpy 4 u, I can't even have a room -.-
Idk what I searched to stumble upon this channel... Saw over a million followers and wondered why... I'm only to Mr.Bill/Hand style Titanic scene, but I now I understand...
You deserve this💓💓💓🌹🌹🌹 keep thriving we're so proud😍🥳🥳🥳woooo
Her deep voice is so fitting. Glad you add it to your videos.
Super wise to stay out of debt.
She’s by far the most adorable and genuinely appreciative youtuber I’ve ever witnessed and it’s great
I’m so happy for you and you DO deserve it and then some. This is the product of YOUR hard work, mama— YOU did this— great job! It looks beautiful. Do project videos! Cant wait to see how you transform it and make it your own :)
The disclaimer 😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Of course you deserve this. Isn't that what we learnt in school is the idea of ,,the American Dream"?!
hey i never comment on your videos but i do hope youve been doing well your comment about being stalked has stayed in my mind wish you safety and happiness!
Congratulations 🍾 I’m very happy for you!!! God bless u!
I can't believe how unbelievably happy I am for you since you showed the inside for the first time. That house really is a dream house, and I hope it will be your dream home for a long time. I can't wait to see what you make of it :)
whoa... $40 couch. Nice find!  You're so interesting - seamstress/dressmaker, intelligent, funny, quirky... you're like... everything! I'd like to present myself as authentically to the world too :)
2:18
What type of bird is garion??
YAY you got a house
This gave me physical, visceral jealousy—living in a one bedroom apartment with curtains for doors.
Oh sis, you are fun❤️😀👍
Nice house!! More room... for more hens :D
Congratulations! I love your videos and you are my favorite youtuber! I am so glad that you were able to get this house!
I am fifteen and I go on Zillow every day as if I could actually buy a house
Shes so hilarious I watched the whole sponsorship part of the video
I AM SO SO HAPPY AND PROUD OF YOU GIRL     FANTASTIC
First 3 weeks
Ты ж моя солнышко
Uhhhhh...more videos PLEASE
Congrats!!
dude when you get to five minutes and it's STILL AN ADD... You used to be so relatable.
I wish I could like this more times than once, because my face hurts from smiling more than I have in the past 12 months
imagine being this pretty and funny and talented all at once.
Girl i dont even know who you are
The ad that came up before this video was the same sponsored ad that is part of the video
Lol.  Congrats!!!!!
Where did you get that gilded looking backsplash?! it's so beautiful!!
Okay but can we show appreciation at how much of a genius Micarah is with the way she designs her videos and how ever random thing/joke connects to each other eventually. Like the illegal movie website with watching movies while doing your nails. Then veganism with the animals. *chefs kiss*
she said she wont show the front of the house but then she showed it.....is better if she didnt say where she lived
So happy for you =) love u
My last house (as opposed to your first house) is one state away from you and also has a deer head on the wall. His name is Jerry and he was delicious.   I'm retired so I also chase sunlight squares around in the morning. Later, over coffee at the diner, we discuss what not to do today so we won't miss Him if Jesus comes back today. Later still, I sew. I am so happy for your new house. You are insanely talented and hard-working so you deserve it absolutely.
So Happy For You!!!!
I got your own glamnetic add lmaooooooo
Who else had her Glamnetic ad as the first ad Like the actual skippable ad lol
Congratulations!!
I love how appreciative you are about your house and towards your fans ❤️ Most successful youtubers think their sh#t doesn't stink and have an entitled attitude and act like their audience is below them 🙁 Good karma comes and stays to those who deserve it.... Good for you! 😘
1208-..
"do you believe in reincarnation?"  "No, but they might"  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
To hell with the imposter syndrome. YOU DO DESERVE THIS. Youve worked hard for it. Be proud of your accomplishments. I wish you nothing but the best!
I always follow patches of sunlight when I'm home at my parents house. My own apartment does not get enough sun ever
❤️ thanks for your awesome videos!!!
YOU DO DESERVE THIS
Proud of u
I felt that fear of debt
I love her ads. I don’t know why at all
I never thought I would see the day you took sponsorships lmaoo
Sis serving looks in her new house. Congratulations! I’m buying a pool for my mom’s home and I feel like an adult 😅
Your fear of debt is definitely not irrational in America
11:32 That was so cool. I want that. How did you do. HAAAAAAAAAAAAA
wait... are the seventeen diamonds she possesses on her engagement ring...
I bought my first house a year ago. I literally reacted the exact same way as you. And I LOVE IT. It is truly amazing having ypur own home ❤

Congrats! Can’t wait to see you turn it into an atelier full of gorgeous clothes! 👗
i cant explain it but she soo .. soothing? relaxing?? MICARAH I FIND COMFORT I YOUR VIDEOS
Tewers
I dont believe in sidewalks either. :)
Holy cow!!! ❤I'm so HAPPY for you!!!!  NEVER STOP HAVING WILD DREAMS!!! This world needs more dreamers as wonderful as you. GOD BLESS YOU!!!! 🙌🙏❤💖✨♥🙌🙏❤💖
I’m just curious but in your state is every house made with low ceilings?
Did anybody else get an ad with her in it before the video started it this was perfect
Seeing Micarah so happy to have a house makes me happy XD
1.5 persons? Grandpa??!!?!?!
When all of your wishes come true, many of your dreams will be destroyed - Marilyn Manson
In India and some other Asian countries nobody moves out of their parents house, if they get a new house the parents move with them. Only in America do we despise being around our parents so much. I would hope to see her buy a big house and move everybody in so we can have the same shenanigans as always. Now she’s just gonna be just a normal YouTuber.
My husband and I actually looked at that house! We decided to stick to the cuyahoga valley area . Moving from Georgia.. . Funny cause The second we decided to move to Ohio I immediately thought “what are my Chances of running into micarah at goodwill”
I cried a little watching this ngl
You deserve it!!!! 💖💖💖💖
Me, first time watcher, utterly confused, checking the settings to see if I had accidentally left the playback speed on 1,25 only to be even more confused when it's still on normal wtf x'DD
<3 I'm so happy for you !!!!
watching the last clips of you reminded me of this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wqsiPazPoY Congrats! Wonderful house!!
Never say you don’t deserve it!! You do ♥️
I understand, much happiness in your new home.
I clicked on this video and got the add of yours from this exact video XD
Did anyone else get a midroll ad for glamnetic with micarah in it Right after the sponsored segment? 😂
I'm so happy for you <3
micarah i just want to say that if you kinda script your videos then you are an incredible writer or if you don't you are incredibly witty and a great storyteller
Congratulations (:
Lol when I got your own ad while watching your video.
I didn't subscribe to you to watch makeup ads!! I miss your older videos! 😒 Where do you go?? ..u subscribe.. 😒
EEEEEEEEPPPPPP YOU BOUGHT A HOUSE!!!!! :D *jumping and dancing excitedly in spirit with you*
this is so wholesome im so happy for you!!
One of my ads that played before the video was an eyelash ad with Micarah
If joy was a person your happiness is contagious I'm very happy for you congratulations 🤗💕
I would like to repeatedly kick every man in the balls that has ever violated the privacy of my precious internet big sister.
Congratulations!!
Micarah, I've had the glamnetics site open since the day you posted this video. Unfortunately I've never put fake eyelashes on myself so have no idea what size or shape I am. Can you help?? Or if anyone knows any online resources to figure this out...I'd appreciate it! 💜
yay congratulations!!
i'm so so so happy that you are able to find a house and be an owner after thinking you wouldn't be able to 💞💘💓💘💞 you deserve it
Congrats
SHE TOLD US SHE WAS ENGAGED IN THIS VIDEO. HOW DID WE MISS THIS? (2:17)
Congratulations.
What did I do? How did I get here?
I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU MICARAH!!! YOU 100% DESERVE THIS!

I hope those animals weren't real No hate love ur videos find them so funny
Did anyone get the Micarah  ad for glamnetic as an actual ad with a Micarah video. Because I think I just had a micarah inception
I am sooooo so so soooo so happy for you aaaaaahhhhhh it actually made me tear up idk why it just happened shhhh anyways congrats!!!!!!!!!!!
God loves you !!! :D
Hyyyyy congrats so happy for youjuuuu😍😍😍😘😘
What's difficult is not recognizing you deserve this, it's recognizing that everyone deserves this. Don't ignore them to punish yourself.
I got somethings from glamntice
please tell me I wasn't the only one who saw the same pink engagement mug at the end (13:45) from her Atonement video...? congrats Micarah!!
Please tell me where you got that blue blouse.
My friend said she would rather you tell her you’re a vampire
You are f***ing insane!! I love you soo much 😂😂😂👌 mint!
Literally got her magnetic eyelash ad right before the video played 😂
THE VID IS EXACTLY 14 MIN!
What bout ur dream house? 🥺😩☹️😖😣
when her dad was recording and she was showing us around it reminded me of a five year old showing me her new playhouse for her barbies...
yoo know whts funny. her last video was 14 minutes ,long. and this vid is exactly 13:59 mins. WOW
I'm soooo happy for you!! The house looks great!!!
I bought my 1922 bungalow in 2014. It checked every box: hardwood floors, tall ceilings, cool built ins strange shaped rooms and a big backyard. It's a dream come true.
It is an amaziiinnnngggggg house! So cute!
OMiGurSh, I am obsessed with anything that has to do with the Victorian era. Also, you look so happy! I'm super happy for you along with plenty of other people I'm sure. :> alsooooo (sewing a Victorian era dress for the sake of your nonexistent tea party)
I'm so happy for her she FINALLY moved into an actual house.😱🧡🤯
Congrats! Best feeling ever! Live your best home owner life! Woo!
you make watching ads fun.  you deserve this house.
I’m so happy for you dear ,please do enjoy your humble abode 🎀
I’m so happy for you success! You deserve it!!! Congrats since 🇲🇽 city 💛💛
Holy ____.... A deer in a wig😂🤣😂🤣
Congrats! I hope you have wonderful moments and times in your new abode!
I image that really old house is haunted but the ghosts there love her so much they don't wanna scare her away
Just now realizing her saying she’s now in possession of 17 diamonds at 2:21 was her foreshadowing her engagement - her diamond ring!!!
Warning! This video contains serious crimes           🤣🤣
I’m addicted  to Zillow too since we started looking for a house (in Ohio too- your house reminds me of a few houses I have seen 😳) and now 5 months later I keep opening that damn app almost every day
Those are my dream shoes where.... please where ;_;
So glad ur happy
Micarah: I hope u don’t mind that ur ears will   Bleed Me: I do not mind at all
talking to your house is a type of magic :')
love the house congrats about your engagement <3
Me my cousins and sister and I would get along well 😂
im so happy for you even tho i dont know u that much but you seem pretty down to earth it makes me feel like ive always known u
We'll miss your RV though... and your chickens? Don't you miss the simple life?
It’s so pretty 😍😍😍
that SMILE just shows how happy and grateful you are! I'm so happy for you
When did her videos start becoming half advertisements ? Super disappointing from a YouTuber I loved so much 😢
Lmao I got an ad for glamnetic lashes 2/3 of the way through the video and it was literally a clip of this one
this is why i don't skip your ads because you deserve good things ;u; so happy for you <3
Jack Sparrow: I've got a jar of dirt! Micarah Tewers: I've got a house!
Congratulations!!!
You deserve ittttt and moreee
6:15 One of my lifelong biggest fears has been *death.* ~was what I thought she said.
YOU SHOULD NAME YOUR HOUSEEE ALSO CONGRATS U DESERVE IT!!!
Smart, talent, funny and beautiful 🤩 the perfect woman ever.... biz biz from Paris 🇫🇷
"I don't believe in sidewalks" It's a really pretty affirmation, ill be using it from now on ✌😌😌✌
rewatching this video, i realized that she already had the mug that says "does this ring make me look engaged?" at 13:43. if you watched her video after this video, you would have seen that mug when she was talking about the difference between americans and british. wow i feel like a detective trying to find her easter eggs to her engagement lol. btw congrats to you and joey :)
She has come so far from when I started watching her almost 2 years ago and I'm so proud of her. She truly deserves it.
AHHHHH YOUTUBE PUT THE AD VERSION OF THE SPONSER DURING THE MIDDLE OF THE VIDEO I HAVE PHOTO PROOF
Eeeeeeeek!!! 🥳 How Exciting! I am almost 60 and love watching your videos! You  work so hard and are so funny, smart, unique and creative! But beyond all of that you are humble and grateful and that is what makes you even more inspiring and beautiful! Congratulations... you definitely deserve it! 💖
I have come here to say I totally misjudged you and I apologize
Ah, that feeling 😌
YES! Micarah purchased a home!!! Can't wait to see what you do with it! Congratulations!  My parents had a couch just like that years ago. I loved that couch!
1. Your glamnetics ad came up on your own video and it scared me 2. You look gorgeous 3. I love your lounge couch
are people really stalking you that badly? that's really awful. I'm sorry you have to go through that. you're very brave for continuing your career here on youtube. I wish you luck, Micarah
CONGRATULATIONS!!!! I don’t wear makeup stuff, but I watch the sponsor part anyway
nice Lolita outfit...is this woman one of the Housewives of somewhere?
watching the video after watching the Glamnetic sponsership, and then an add played for the same footage from a glamnetic ad lol
YOU LIVE IN OHIO?!? \(>.<)/
If I had cool and understanding parents, I'd have no problem staying at home for longer! Good for you on getting the house in your own time.
wonderful!! great job lol
I bought a house (and half of the video is sponsorship)
GIRLLL YOU DESERVE IT SO MUCH!!! CONGRATS ✨❤️❤️❤️
Omg btw did she say she now owns diamonds because there are diamonds on her engagement ring???
Also, has anyone noticed that her last video was supposed to be 14:00 minutes long, and this one was 13:59, Lol?
As a crime Junkie. PLEASE KEEP YOUR ADDRESS PRIVATE! I like watching your videos and would like to continue!!!!
Ok but did NO ONE notice the ghost at the 4:55 mark.. I had to re watch it a few times
First this and then she's engaged I'M SHOOKat how much we don't know about her. Really happy for her though and I wish her all the happiness in the world 😍
i have never worn fake lashes in my life and had no intention to in the future..but your ad really had me questioning whether I need glamnetic lashes xD
You deserve this. You're so talented and funny.
I can't stop smiling!!! Im so happy for you girl!!💕💕💕
Now knowing that Micarah is engaged- I understand the “17 Diamonds” comment MUCH better! Congrats!!!!
Earlier I got a 3 minute Glamnetic lashes ad featuring Micarah. Did not skip at all even though I’ve seen it before. So happy for you, Micarah! You deserve everything!
Congratulations, you DESERVE IT! Lot's of love all the way from Australia xx
I am so happy you bought and found the house of your dreams, it’s stunning. You so deserve this. Lots of love from the uk
"i am now in possession of seventeen diamonds" ANYONE ELSE NOTICE--- (that's a nice number of diamonds to have on an engagement ring ;)
not me rewatching specifically for the glamnetics ad bc i want to buy some....;)
Only me who thought my video speed was at 1.25?
You're welcome
iam so glad for yooou i know how amazing it feels to finally feel at home and how exiting it all is i wish you the best best best things in the world you are an amazing person you deserve this!!!!!! a lot of love from croatia!!!!!
CONGRATS SIS now you have a bigger space to do anti social!!!!! Stuff-

CONGRATS!!!! <3
Ur so funny lol🤣
YAY! I’m so happy for you.

I love how happy you look in your house. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
The way your dad looked at you so proud while you were reading the letter :')
I'm sorry people have been stalking you but baby you deserve this house!!!!! You DESERVE IT!!! I'm so happy for you
"I am now in possession of 17 diamonds" HER ENGAGEMENT RING
Im sooo happy for you, that video honestly made me more happy Keep going girl!
seeing her so happy makes me so happy for her!!
I'm so happy for you but side bar: the fact that Gary navigates his way around your house to your room is incredible and I think I want a pet bird now 🐦
I think this is the first advertisement in a video that I followed up with
CONGRATULATIONS!!!! <3
WHY DID THE LAST BIG MAKE ME CRYYY
Is nobody going to notice how the video again is 14 minutes? 😂😂
You are way too beautiful naturally to wear so much makeup! I miss your originality. Sponsoring makeup? Really? Please don't be a lemming.. I'm unsubscribing now. With a VERY sad face.. 😟🥺😆😬😁😎👌🤘
Holy crap  One  I’m in love with ur house  Two SHES SO FREAKING PRETTY OMMMGGGGGG three I absolutely LIVE for ur videos Period
I thank you for the invitation to your house and I must say I respect your decline because some people may be creepy.. but congratulations ❤️
LOVE this video, you give GREAT advice! You really deserve this, you're so generous.  Please only share what you feel comfortable sharing and stay super safe!!
Did anyone notice that this video is exactly 14 minutes long?
This is sweet! Don't loose your values and morals as you get more famous! Stay centered on and grounded in the Lord and His word and be a light to your followers! 💛 He's blessed you so much and given you such a wide reach!
If any of yall creeps get close to micarah its on sight 😡😡😡😡😡Yall lets protect her!!!!
Congratulations!! You do deserve this! I can’t wait to see you enjoying yourself there.
Bleep Street is such a great street. Love Bleep Street.
No joke sometimes when I go out because I have really long eyelashes some people come up to me and Are like, do you have Mascara on or false eyelashes, on and I’m like no, and they’re like what.
11:38 you cannot tell me she ISNT a Disney Princess
Aaaaah!!!! I just got that she was referring to her engagement ring when she said that about the diamonds!!! Good one Micarah! We had no odea
Looking at her hair in the beginning gives me Sleeping Beauty vibes
CONGRATULATIONS!!! I am so happy for youuuuuu♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Not me getting an add of this exact video before it started 💀
why are you so cute
i got ur ad for glamnetic when i clicked on this lmao
Can someone tell me what her shoes are called?
Well now you‘re just getting me excited for the day i get to have a house and get to decorate too
“That’s a flaw, I like flaws, no one likes perfection” - alien 2021
she fucking sold me on glamnetics.  Online Marketing A++
Can some of y’all respect her privacy especially the people who went to her dad’s house
I like how I was watching the video and was wondering "huh I wonder where she got those lashes" then BAM sponsor lmao also I'm so happy that not only does she have over a million subs but also views because that just shows how much we all truly love watching her (even me whose been watching forever but doesn't sub because I'm afraid of her never showing up in my recommendations after)
13:41 thats such an aesthetically pleasing shot like look at that
I'm glad she is taking her security more seriously.
I love how grateful you are & responsible too. I moved out years ago at a very early age. I shouldn’t have done that. Now I advise anyone who will listen that the best thing to do is to live at home for as long as you can. Bills are not fun. Having a savings account is fun. I’m glad to see I’m not the only one who thinks this way.
Her reaction to her house was the cutest thing omg
we love you, Micarah  you make us happy
you deserve this actually, you brought me a ton of happiness during this panoramic
Congratulations! Very much deserved it looks amazing!
You make me wanna have a house
So happy for you Micarah ! God is the ever giving 🤩❤👌
Youuu deserve it allll
Yeayyy Micarah’s house 👏👏👏👏👏👍
Ahhh congrats 💖💖💖💖
I can't wait to see the makeover videos
Congrats on the new house,. so happy for you Micarah. You do deserve it! you're so funny, talented and positive.
💜💜💜
You already know that she's gonna be an old lady with a deep love for her house that has taken on her character over the decades and everyone in the neighbourhood is gonna be like "oh that's Ms Tewers house"
that house looks like it fits your personality so well I’m so happy for you!!
Get a few camera and security system please. You deserve to be super happy and safe!
Not me getting a ad it is glamnettic and it is her ad
Okay but how the frick did you know I’m scared of clowns.?
Your add ( 2:10 ) played before the video I love it ❤️
I blame the princess and the pauper for making you scared of debt
AHAHAHAHHA you make the craziest sponsors jajajajajaj
Girl yesss!!! I got mine recently too! Old and tall AF!
Yay
#lashesordered
You do deserve it
I'm so so happy for you  I wish I was your friend I would love to come visite you help around the house make tea parties together
CONGRAAAATSS!!!💖💖
aaa i’m so happy for you! congrats on your new house!
You are lovely Micarah Take care
Ironically, right before the video, I got an ad of that exact clip.  I know it was an actual ad because the skip ad button was there😂
Congratulations
Don't forget to blur the front of the house/ views out the windows in future videos so creepy people don't work out the address. Sorry to hear creepers be creeping.   But congrats on the new house, you deserve it because you worked hard for it, so don't put yourself down. 👍
Congrats!💖💖
Congratulations on your new home! Can't wait to see you decorate it! All the best!
Buying your first home is amazing. My first was way too big (3600 sq ft), but it was 100 years old with amazing arches and doors and glass knobs. And a fully remodeled basement that had a 2nd kitchen and a massive dining room for all of the huge holiday dinners I cooked and hosted there.  And best of all,  a lot of amazing memories.  My daughter got ready for all of her dances there,  graduated there and that is where she flew the coop.
I always watch your ads babe! 😘💲💲 Congrats on your house!!!!
I'm legit almost crying because I'm so happy for you idk why but like, this is obviously so important to you and I'm literally just so happy cause you worked literally so hard for this, you deserve it Micarah ;w; <3
The house is like 5x bigger than my house lol
4:05 <- my fav!!!! :]
I’m a I really happy for u like honestly u really deserve it u work so hard and always entertain. I love all your videos over the years and ur extremely entertaining I’m happy I found ur home and can’t wait for the new content.
Congratulations gorgeous! You deserve it. It wasn't just because of us. You earned it and are so so very talented. Never forget that you are the reason why this is all happening
Guys please stop following people and celebrities to their houses 🤦🏽‍♂️its hella weird!! And your not a real fan if you do!!
Southern Indiana is watching.
Michara: *sings for house with feather quill pen*
So happy for you 💞
It's so freaking beautiful and cozy, congratulations girl
Hun if you have lived in a mobile home for most of your life, are carful with with your money and have generally worked and saved for your dream house, then girl YOU DANG WELL DESERVE IT!!! and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. FYI it's the people who have never worked a day in their whole mantion filled life, just waiting for the day their mommy and daddy bye them their own mantion who 😡DON'T😡 deserve it 😁
everyone deserves a house! don't feel bad you found a house meant for you!!!
I got your advertisement by magnetic eyelashes and I was just about to watch your video. ( what a coincidence )
Omg this house is PERFECT for you and I’m so excited to see more!
How can sponsor clip be this funny lmao
about 5 minutes into the video a glamnetic ad popped up and it was literally the clip from earlier in the video at 2:09... idk if that’s a coincidence orrrr
This video brought me so much happiness! Congratulations!
OMG so jelly of all that space!! How gorgeous! I live in a victorian terraced house and it's probably the size of your sewing room hahaha
Your house is soooo beautiful! Congrats to your dream coming true! What a beautiful, delicious house...
Super happy for you!!!!! I’m looking for the same reasons ❤️
Omgg congrats!! I'm really happy for you, you definitely deserve this for everything you do to make all of us happy❤
Her Valentine’s Day dress vidéo what she wanted to be exactly 14 mins it: 14:01 This almost completely unrelated video:14:00
I want a neeeewwww video!!!!! Come onnnnn
Sorry to put a bit of my own here. I am doing my thesis on sewing patterns and specific on zero waste patterns. So I hope there are some people here that might be able to help me out by filling this in (takes about 2 minutes)    https://saxion.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8pHqlimxok3Sg9o
Omg, u gave me lili rienheart (I think I spelt that wrong) vibes! Please do a dressing as lili for a week 🥺
Now you can jump on the bed and lean back in your chair.
YAY!!!!!
Good
Micarah, you deserve every single good thing in this world!! Especially a house!
Can't wait to see what costume you make with those drapes! So happy for you and Tweetie Bird!
Fun fact I got this exact glamnetics sponsor section as an ad before this video and I was confuse for awhile linger then I carr to admit
Am I the only one feeling strangely sad when she wrote: haven't felt that kind of joy in a long time? :( I hope you're doing good micarah ! We love you!
I hope you do yourself a big favor and get a security system. It’s worth it.
I'm sure you give up on reviews at this point, but I just wanted to tell you you're my favorite youtuber.  You and another have convinced me to just start making my own clothing. And, I wanted to thank you for inspiring me to do this. I'm proud you bought your new home. Good job!
Wow it is going to be such a cool serie !! Congrats !!
I am so excited for the day that I can do this one day
You should totally make a dress from the hunger games I would be so haoou
i luv u
You’re the America I believe in !
I think it’s funny, she’s says she wanted her Valentine’s Day vidéo to be exactly 14 minutes but it was 1 second longer but this video is exactly 14 minutes!
I’m a dude that doesn’t wear makeup, but i have to admit that those lashes look bomb.
So happy for you! Thanks for keeping it real but also keeping yourself safe is so comfortable and important! ❤️
i just looked up "what breed of bird does Micarah Tewers have?" It said bald eagle XD
I believe your faith, your loving family, your supportive friends, your genuine creativity and kind heart and down to earth demeanor is why most of us subscribers here love watching you and are so happy for your blessings and success. You deserve it!     P.S Also your humor is so side splitting tears of joy funny that if I had to choose one youtuber to watch for all eternity, youd be my hands down number one choice. You are the closest thing to a disney princess who teaches us how to sew clothing and thrift
I have never seen Micarah this happy that I started crying at the end of the video I'm SO happy for her
I am from Windsor  and I LOVE  YOUR DOWN TO EARTH  videos.  I love you.  And I live in Germany  now  so i took full  responsibility for euro adds ....  lol kiddin.  But i am spreading u.
I feel like I saw this more thank a week ago
That's amazing that I didn't scroll the Promotion part at all.
Micarah, I had a dream you invited me to your house and I accidentally drove a car into a window of your new house. I woke up believing this to be real for a solid 3 minutes. I apologize for any stress dreams you might suffer about people driving cars into your windows due to my reckless dreaming.
PLEASE MAKE VIDEOS DECORATING :)
The black sneeze nally scold because drum reportedly deliver behind a ready wax. psychotic, squalid twine
How do I get a house ?
That house looks lovely. God bless you! You deserve a nice home for yourself. You've accomplished so much in a short amount of time. Bask in the beauty of what you earned. It's amazing. No regrets.
i’m so happy for you but you underestimate crazy stalkers!!!! Too much info girlfriend!! I hate that i’m stepping on your joy and i have to say you totally deserve this and everything you’ve worked for!
You deserve it. You are so  entertaining.
Love this video! Congrats ❤️❤️ love you girlll❤️
I have watched this video multiple times mostly just for the ad.
I literally just moved into my new house this past Friday too! I feel you. It’s an amazing feeling.
It is currently921 and March 17 Wednesday and tomorrow is saint patty's day oh I'm kind of scared yeah We have no milk we don't have anything ready graysen's making a tiny little note out of store for same party person won't come in his room and destroy it and yeah that's how it's going for me
is any one else just genuinly happy for her? casue im stoked at this. well done and thank you for being an ispereration for  me.
You deserve this, c'mon! By the way CONGRATULATIONS!
Adulting Micarah here :0
i love ur house so much
does anybody know where her shoes are from???
This will be me when I can finally afford to get my own house. It certainly won't be as big and beautiful as yours though haha! Congrats, you do deserve it! I appreciated the affirmation of staying at home until you can actually afford a house - I'm scared of debt like you too haha! Might as well start life off the right way if you can :P
that is the cutest thing I've ever seen!!!
I am so happy for her!
I never really wanted a house. Until this video. It made me so giddy and happy for some reason. It really shows just how much you love it. Please don't say you don't deserve this. You're brilliant at what you do, and you give us so much back with your videos. Cannot wait to see a full house tour!
When she said she wouldn’t show the front of the house for safety reasons I half shouted the word “MEN” the same way Draco Malfoy says mud-blood and I’m really happy a Harry Potter reference comes up later in the video.
Congrats on your house!  Do you ever look at pictures of your child self and wish you could still fit in some of your old child clothes? If you do, can you please make a video recreating a few of your favorites?
Congrats!!!!! So happy for you ❤️
I'm So Happy for you!
This house is gorgeous. Love the character,vintage style. Congratulations on your new house.❤
Did I just watch an entire youtube video of advertisements and like the video before I even got to the real content because it was so entertaining?? Yes...Yes I did.
I'm a little late, but congrats on your house Micarah, you deserve it. Stay safe y'all 😊💕
👏👏👏👏👏
Not me being 18 and obsessed with looking at houses on zillow that I know I can't afford 👀
SO HAPPY FOR YOU, OMG!!
Congratulations. Keep winning! 🎉🎉🎉
I'm so happy for you Micarah!!!! <3 Don't say you don't deserve itttttt.
So happy for you! You've worked your butt off for this!

What kind of bird does she have?
Heartiest congratulations 😘😘😘😘u the best🌻🌻🌻
Sooo happyy for youuu
I love this dry sense of humor  wait what, no you DO deserve this
disappointed in your use of the word "spastic" around 11:46 which is a used as a derogatory term for disabled people (or when you want to call someone unintelligent by comparing them to a disabled person)...i imagine you didnt know but when i heard you say it i instantly felt distanced from you and sad :(
Hello Micarah! Can you re-create Taylor Swift’s Oscar de la Renta F/W 21 floral dress she wore on the Grammys the other day? Thanks!!!
not her calling out your fear of clowns
Ohhh congratulations!!!! 🥰✨🎂
I need a whole video on her adorable relationship with Gary
"im very particular about which laws i break" is a whole mood
congratulations :)
CONGRATULATIONS ❤️
I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU DUDE! You absoloutly desrve this you have worked for it! stay safe isa
Micarah! You are the queen and you WILL have that mansion one day.
Princess And her animal sidekick  in the Room

I love how she was having so much fun with the sponsored products.
Why does her audio sound like it's on a higher speeeeeed
Congratulations!!!
your subscribers did not give it to you, God did. and I'm so happy for you! praise the Lord
“I’m very particular about which laws I break....”   Same
I dont wear fake lashes or nails but you bet your sweet bippy I'm sitting through this sponsorship
Of course you deserve it!
Hates debt? Saves? Stayed with family until financially stable? That’s a Taurus alright! 🙌🏼
u sold me on those lashes
Sis we need more vidz please. It’s visceral
Me watching this wearing glamnetic lashes 👁👄👁
Congratulations 🎉🎊
I doubt your gonna see this comment but can you make a Agatha costume from Wanda vision

You should make that 5 minute crafts jeans chair. I think it would look great in your house
You do deserve it :)
I'm so proud of you!! Congratulations 🎉🎉 <3
she is so funny
I love how you can see the happiness just inside her when talking about her house. 😂
She’s so cuteeeeee🥰🥰🥰
She's not tall and that's not a Victorian house, it's a junk modern house made of cardboard and staples.  A "victorian house" is a house which was built during the reign of Queen Victoria.
1:44 can anyone explain to me -a dutch girl- what she's talking about here? because I don't know what it is and I feel left out
Aweeee
I am so happy for you!
that couch costs what i eat out in nyc in a day HUH!?
willingly saw your whole ad. it was great.
THE LASH HAND GOT ME please advertise all things
My role model bought a house!!!!!

So happy for u ❤️
Can you make the 2015 Cinderella dress?
I thought you said you're scared of DEATH not DEBT. Both scary tbh.
Okay but that ending of pure happiness gave me joy😭😭💖💖
~I don’t believe in sidewalks~
YOU. ARE. SO. CUTE. Gosh I’m so happy for you
EGGS
Its nice to see other people happy.  I will never own a house while I'm young. I'm not going to be a business owner or a famous YouTuber orrr have a partner that will help.  I live with my mom and I'm the youngest. I have a full time job thats about it.  But I'm very happy for you.  Watching you happy makes me happy
Can you try to make a fishtail dress in royal blue fabric. It would be amazing if you could.
Omg. First video I've seen of yours and I've died from laughing hahaha. It's okay. I came back alive and subscribed lol
yay
please don't include flashing lights like those at the beginning without a warning aaaaa
WHY HAVE I NEVER SEEN YOUR CHANNEL BEFORE WTH

I hope her and her loved ones are safe from those creeps, can’t begin to imagine what that feels like.

Ok so I don't have Instagram and if you are going to recreate a Grammys look you will probably put a poll up there, BUT... Can I request you to recreate Taylor Swift's dress? 😁
I bought my first house in November, and though it ain't as nice as yours, the feeling is mutual. Congrats! You deserve it 100%

Congrats on your new house Micarah! Your joyful quirkiness and positive energy are bringing smiles to lots of faces making our troubles fade away. Priceless if you ask me, you deserve to have any mansion you want. Thanks for spreading happiness. BTW, don't tell your sponsors but I prefer the before. Also, that lady at 5:58... Simply irresistible! 🤩 Can you cast her more often? Pretty please. 🙏😉
Literally the most precious person on Youtube. We appreciate you
If anyone deserves a house, it is you! You are thw most humble person on youtube. I wish i could have a personality more like you! I can only imagine what you do to your house to personalize it. Also my daughter really thought you were barbie in your holiday barbie video!
Am I the only one that is gonna miss her dad randomly popping up in videos now that she has moved out?
I love when he thought the reincarnation part of the letter needed tweaking. Lol why did I think the same thing right as you read it. Lol
Okay but this makes my heart so happy - if anyone deserves this its Micarah!!!
love this
am so happy for youuu, like this video was so wholesome and cute❤. Plus you looks so gorgeous in the sunlight❤❤
Late to the party, but Congratulations! You’re excitement for the house is so wonderful.
So this just popped up on my recommended page and YOU GO GIRL I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU AND I'VE NEVER WATCHED A VIDEO OF YOURS But, you know, women supporting women ❤
Totally deserved it. I'm happy that great things happened to a wonderful human.
PLEASE show us the renovating process!! i would love to see it cause I just love that sort of thing and also I'm pretty sure most people who are subscribed would also enjoy it!! <3 CONGRATS ON THE HOUSE!!
im 18 and still at home unlike most of the people I know. i think it makes much more sense to live at home until you can actually afford something.
you ABSOLUTELY desserve this house.
Congratulations !!!!! 🎈🍾🎊🎉 I’m so so happy for you!!! You deserve it girl. Now it’s time to make new memories in your home. 😃😃
Micarahs sponsorship commercials are the only ones I will watch cause’ they are so dang funny.
I love you. This was hysterical and amazing
You’re so much fun
Congratulations!! You deserve it
i want to cry? hello? i cant forget the day i woke up really early for school and was mindlessly looking at youtube, and you popped up in my recommended and i fell in love with your videos and personality, and just went on and watched EVERYTHING   AND NOOW AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH that looks like a lovely house to start some chaos in, im so excited to see what you well get up to in there!  this whole time ive been smiling, im like, sosososoos happy for you! this is lovely, this.. this is lovely yes  you gotta dress up like a man from the 90s and open the front door and go "Honey! im home!"  and then yes  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
I read "I bought a horse" for whatever reason and thought _you did WhaaAAaaaAt?_ but then again... It's Micarah, everything's perfectly fine  So I clicked and found out it's not a horse... Was minorly disappointed Congrats Although it's not a horse
It's the best thing ever to see you so incredibly happy!!! Congrats! I'm so happy for you and Gereon!
Looool best commercial for fake lashes, ever! 🤣
OMG im so happy for you!! YOU TOTALLY DESERVE THIS BLESS YOU AND ALL YOUR FAMILY <3
CONGRATULATIONSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS. Yes '
Her house is fucking amazing
Is micarah ace?
Puta ama que eres, es que eres la mejor de verdad ! ILYSM
YAAAAYYYY!! So happy for you!! Congratulations 🎉 what an amazing blessing!! Also: you’re my brain with legs. Watching you is like watching how my brain actually functions out loud. Maybe it’s an artist thing, I’m a photographer, and also spend much of my time editing, going to the bathroom, forgetting to go back to editing, playing Candy crush, rushing to finish editing by midnight 🕛... lame
Debt is terrifying and an extremely rational fear to have!
Congratulations!! This is a very cool and funny video! I don't know you but I am proud of you.
Holy COW I’ve been here since your first video and look how far you’ve come!!! Over a million subs and a HOUSE? You go, girl! As a former fashion design student, it was your transformations that first attracted me to your videos, but it was your personality that kept me around. You deserve it all!
You do deserve this!!! I'm so excited for you!!
Im so happy for you what the heck you deserve this
anyone else cant wait for a clothing line from this incredibly talented queen of weird?❤
I love the dieing at the end <3
Where is ur chickens?
Congratulations on the house, you deserve it😁😁😁😆
Not gonna lie. As I am 22 and sitting in my parents home, I needed that little talk about how staying with parents until you're financially stable enough to move out is okay.
u should make giselle's dresses from enchanted!!!
so happy for you! :3
CONGRATS !
This house is stunning. Congratulations!
Your giddy excitement running through the house is top tier wholesome content.
You totally deserve this. Everyone deserves a home they love❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
The house is SO beautiful and i can’t wait to see how you make it your own!!!
Congrats! Your house is beautiful!
FRIGGIN ADORABLE!!! You AND the house!! Congratulations!!!!
My comment got deleted or i deleted it ILY
Congratulations 👏👏👏
I would never mind ads if they were presented the way you did it 😂😂😂
30% of the video = micarah showing off her legs 30% of the video = micarah freaking out about her new house    40% of the video = micarah making jokes i could never think of
do you REALLY think you don’t deserve this?! girl you have worked your lil butt off so hard with all your videos and things you do outside of youtube, i remember when i first saw your channel when i was about 14, im almost 21 now and it made me tear up seeing how much you’ve achieved and grown 🥲🥲🥲 U GO GIRLLLL
awwww congratulations you deserve it!
I love your house and we will enjoy it through you
Do you have a PO box? I'd like to send you a housewarming gift :)
I wish Micarah made every single commercial ever.   I actually want to buy Glamnetic lashes now, and I will regardless of the fact that I definitely cannot afford it. Lol
That ad was far to long
THAT HOUSE IS GORGEOUS ONG CONGRATS
Micarah’s dad: Can I offer you an egg in these trying times?
I bought glamnetic lashes bc I trust you lol
FELICIDADES AMIGAAAA
im so happy to see her happy it literally almost made me tear up
Why did I see this video and read house as horse
I'm not creepy, you can invite me :).
It's not irrational. It's smart. I feel the same way, I have never had a mortage, I lived humble until I could afford my own home and pay cash for it. I took the bus until I could afford a car. I still choose not to do something rather than take out a loan. With this attitude I have, however still managed to buy a house, buy a car, travel the world got to uni and obtain a master's....twice. Basically, banks have made us believe that we must have it...NOW!!!! and that we need to be in debt in order to have it ..... NOW!!!! We don't. Good on you. I am very happy that you have your house now. Congratulations.
Now don't take a year to redecorate your house lol
I am so happy you made it!!! enjoy your house
I had the weirdest dream the other night, and it involved you in it. Like I think I was having dinner at a Bob Evans, and you just showed up at my table, but you were like really weird and snobby. And I was like “that’s not Micarah, what is the devils magic!” And then I woke up, and I was just like... what the H E double hockey stick just happened? It’s okay though, I still absolutely love you and your channel!!!!!!!!!  😍🥰😘😂🤣😆
Congratulations on the new house woohoooo! 😍❤️ also good idea to not show the front I can’t believe how creepy and disrespectful of boundaries people can be! 🥺 stay safe sis and enjoy your beautiful new home!  You DO deserve it! 🥰
You're  videos have made so happy! I've watched you grown into this amazing woman, and I'm EXTREMELY happy for you! Congrats! 💃🏾
HOUSE TOUR AFTER YOU'RE DONE ARRANGING EVERYTHING PLEASE!!!
OMG, Zillow is addictive! adulting.
Really really respect your principles!
Finally you have a house  no longer live in a van
You are entertaining AF, your editing skills are freakin amaziiiiing, and you're hella inspiring. freakin LOVE your house♥
Oh baby you deserve more 😂😂😂🤍
Happy Micarah is the most precious thing in the world and must be protected at all costs!
GOSH I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU!!! ❤❤❤ YOU TOTALLY DESERVE THIS 🥺❤
OMG CONGRAAAAATSSSSSSS
Congratulations! New house... Yay!
Strangers stop at your house because they saw your YouTube?! WTF... (shaking my head)
The part about how you told your dad out loud what you wrote to the sellers made me laugh so loud oh my god...I think its the fact that your dad is like......I have no words. You are the funniest content creator Oh my god....😂
cant wait for the decor and renovation!!!!!!!!! congrats micarah!!
Congratulations 👏
You are so sweet! I’m thrilled for you!
This brings me great joy.
I’ve never seen someone have this much joy in their eyes. You truly do deserve this, can’t wait to see it in your videos and love it right along with u!
I keep cycling between wanting her to be gay so that I have a chance (which I have 0% no matter who she likes cuz this is a parasocial relationship and I’m not insane) while also wanting her to be straight cuz seeing her with another girl would be heartbreakinnggggg😭😭🤣🤣 just become a nun! For my sanity🥰🥰
I live with my parents (I pay rent) because the county we live in is unnecessarily expensive. I do, used to think I wanted a mansion (mostly for the express purpose of having enough space to have several people stay over at any given moment) but now I think I'll be happy if I just am able to afford having any place that is my own. also I have never been so tempted to purchase beauty products I don't really care for until princess Micarah came along.
next glamnetic ad put the lashes on the taxidermied deer
awww congrats u woman☺️
i was expecting a box for her to live in ;'(
I’m so proud of you miss gurl ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
A WHOLE SWEETHEART
U totally deserve it <3 congrats
Congratulations on your new home!
Keep bringing us the magic that the rest of us (who were cruelly conditioned by constant exposure to the outside world) can never get back. Congrats on your house, I hope it brings you endless good memories!
omg I love your house and i am so excited!!!
Where's your berd?
Sooo happy for you!! Woot woot!
I''m late but YOU GOT A HOUSE!
I feel your happiness, I'm moving into a new flat with a few friends soon and am thrilled beyond whatever is positively far away
I just opened your last video to get some peaceful Micarah vibes before sleep.. And boy did your excitement wake me up and even gave me energy.. CONGRATS on you purchase 😉😃
I’m so HAPPY FOR YOU!!!!
YAY! Congratulations Micarah and Garreon (I know I spelled that wrong, sorry!) !!
Congratulations ❤️❤️❤️🥳
If anyone deserves this it’s definitely you!! Congratulations 🎉💜
Awwwwnnn, congrats Micarah
This is the longest yet most fun ad ever
LOVE THIS FOR YOU BBYYYYYYYY <3
Idk why but I get Giselle from Enchanted out of Micarah
you just made my day.
Hooray, congratulations!🎉🥳 I'm so happy for you!🤗
congrats!
I would pay you for publicity. Titanic, I died
Thank you for your words about living with your parents until you're actually READY to move out on your own terms! I agree, but there's a lot of pressure out there and it can get you down if you move at a different pace than most of your peer group!
Dude good for you. That's awesome
Congratulations!! Hard work pays off :) I love your videos
Omg I’m so happy for you! Can’t wait to see all the renovation-ish videos!
I hate advertisements but omg that was so chaotic I loved it 😂
Omg I need you to be a guest on the sweet boy podcast. I’m convinced Garret is your long lost brother.
I’m so happy for you... this is well deserved 😍😍
Please tell me that the house in the thumbnail isn't actually your house (for safety reasons not bc it's ugly)
Finally someone who gets my obsession with Zillow.
You should try and recreate miss piggy’s dress from the bicycle ride scene in the great muppet caper movie!
4:33 into your video and I'm like: What the heck?! Stop! I clicked on this video because I wanted to know how you bought a house darn it! 😆 Why do you make the best commercials! I can only imagine how much in sales Magnetics have made solely from sponsoring you. That Titanic reference was just so good lol.
you seem so happy it looks like you get pure joy from this house and aaa this makes me so happy!!!!! i love victorian homes as well omgmggm
Congratulations darling 🎊wish you the best enjoy your time 😊. (now u have no excuses for not making more videos, cuz you don't have enough space, now you can keep on hoarding haha! 😝)
Am really  happy  for you I lo e the house
Congratulations hun ❤❤❤
If this isn't the most wholesome video ever......     WHAT IS????????????????????
Omggggg Congratulations❤️
I am convinced she is secretly a witch princess with magical dress making powers and nobody can tell me otherwise!
It makes me so happy to see her so happy
Congratulation for your new house! you deserve it girl💖
Omg congraaaaaaats!!😍
Congratulations!!
You do deserve it you worked hard to get to where you are at. The time you spend in your videos is crazy and your content is amazing. The fact you sew and create stuff takes time. You are amazing!
Congratulations love 🤗😊🎉So happy for you 🙏you deserve the best coz you are amazing ✨💖
😃😃😃
Congratulations!!! The inside is FABULOUS!!!!  You deserve this - you are a brilliant writer/performer/editor.
Day 2 of asking Micarah to make a 6 feet social distancing dress.

Glad to hear you don't have anything against my country (iraq) love you 😂💞💞
How are you so amazing and funny and just wonderful?! HOWWWW
The titanic plug in is so good I laugh hard
Im also in fear of debt!
This is exactly how I hope to be when i move out 😃
"You believe in reincarnation?"  "No, but they might!"  Bwahahahaha (and then I remembered there are emojis for that.) 🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
This is the first video of hers I see, and now it's literally hours later and thank you 💫 algorithm 💫
I feel the same way about mortgage and new buildings 🤭 Love seeing you happy! Congratulations on a beautiful purchase!
I’m really sorry people made you feel unsafe. I’m so happy for you about your new house though!
This video was so heartwarming. Congrats
SO SO HAPPY FOR YOU!!!!
Is there room for the chickens??
Congratulations! I, too, would love to have a Disney princess as my neighbor.
Congratulations!!
Aye 513 gang!!
Micarah at the start of the video: *explaining the audio in the house is deadly* Micarah again: I hope you don’t mind ;D
this was the most WHOLESOME hfjfjfn i am smiling so much rn u deserve this
everyone always talks abt how she’s the only person who’s paid promotions we watch but can we also talk abt how we don’t scroll through the comments during her videos
Girl you do deserve it! You work hard and are talented
Hahaha but rly looking forward to the decor onslaught of vlogs, blogs and or clogs she'll have for us next. 🆕 🏡 😜
I'm really sorry that people violate your privacy. That makes me so sad, but watching you be so excited about your house makes me happy.
She's younger than me, has two mobile homes and now an actual home - clearly I've made the bad choices in life.
Congratulations well deserved queen
I want Micarah and Amber Scholl to be friends
I’m happy for you.
When she talks I feel like a psychiatrist
Debt is scary because once you owe someone you're locked into that until you pay it off, no matter what happens in the coming years. It's fine to want to only pay for things with money you have.
Congratulations. You do deserve it. I like the paint color of that teal green. Enjoy your new space!
Can you please try to sew a dress with really long press on nails on?
I'm surprised that no cut word or cut clip of something in the a Video Lol I was waiting for it...!!! hahaha
I never wanted a bird until now and I was in my room and I said I want a bird and then I whispered halfway I want a bird and then said the rest and demonic voice
i love watching her ads LOL never skip them
I need a congratulations I like the video before watching it cuz bye I just knew I was going to love this and it's also my way of saying yasss bitch  get it I guess
you should make a tea room!!!
me watching her put her shoes on the couch: 👁️👄👁️
this is my first time watching her videos and she's so damn funny I really enjoyed her paid promo rant ✋🏼😭
Congratulations! Looking fwd to seeing your journey in your new home!
day 17 of asking for a  QnA
Um- WHY DOES SHE LOOK SO FLAWLESS????
the only youtuber who I know i won't skip any pars of the videos
My dream to have a house at least comparable to yours... Probably never gonna happen, all my life I've been living in poor houses with exposed bricks and no comfort at all (lmao it literally rains over my head)
Congrats!!!!!
The only adds I'm actually happy to watch
that promotion deserves an award
Congratulations 🥳🥳🥳
Hand puppet was hilarious
U need God repent of your sins
lol girl im so jelly! but at the same time I really enjoy you and your channel you really deserve it for all your hard work <3 Really happy things are going well for you Micarah!
I love that she sounds like Barbie
Girl is it haunted 😦
Day three of asking Micarah to make something with no stitch.
That giddy "i have a house" moments is so cute. For some reason I'm so proud of you.  You deserve everything you have.
how'd they let a bird in the bank?
This video made me cry. happy for you. <3
I'd like to know if you saw Nomadland and what you thought? Congrats on the house :)) <3
We are so proud of you Michela
Omg that bird ?!!!
I hope that’s not THE key in the thumb nail. Read people can 3-D print copies of keys. I know she took precautions but if you use sold filters on Zillow you can likely find the house.
congrats! :D
Firstly; You 100% deserve your house. The fact you think you don't is really fucking sad. You made that happen, you deserve every square inch. Secondly; the way your dad looked at you when you were reading out your letter to the original owners, omg. You could see how proud he was.
Why did I watch the entire ad portion
You should make an Anya Taylor joy Doir looks!!!
But the RV?
Your house is beautiful 😍
omg i'm sooo happy for you!! i'm sure you will turn this house into something amazing and i will be jelly that i'm not that creative :D i want to paint my walls now... dammit...
I'm so happy for you!!!!
Ah yes, the millennial fear of debt that none of us realize the other one has
Dang if the first issue that came to mind about my Dad was too many offers for scrambled eggs, I would NEVER move out lmao X'D
I literally cannot wait for a house makeover/tour!!!
rock on chick, AWESOME!!!
You're awesome, just wanted you to know ^^
OMG!!! So exciting! 🎉🎉🎉 🥳 congrats!
you have a cupboard under the stairs!!!!! omg that's the best part of the house!!
Hosting Victorian and Regency Tea parties?! Girl I’m all for this!!
i am genuinely so so so happy for you!! ❤ you DO deserve this!!
When I was watching it I had no clue you bought a house my mind was on the other side of that possibility.
how did you make our chickens Diapers
Omgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomg 👁👄👁
Congratulations I’m so happy for you!!! You work so hard for what you have and entertain millions with your amazing personality:) Also I am hoping with all my might that you share some DIY house edition videos!!! We would love to see you updating your spaces :)
Girl we love you, SO HAPPY FOR YOU. You deserve it
So pure 🤍 Congratulations!!! You deserve it
I laughed when Micarah said "I'm very particular on which laws I break"
Pray to God. He wants to hear from you <3
Omg you'r amazing
I love you  ...and this is a huge compliment, but you would've made an excellent demon in supernatural
I’m in the middle of buying a house at the moment and it has been such a long, complicated process that I’d almost forgotten it was meant to be a good thing. But the sheer joy that emanates from this video is infectious and, for the first time in a long time, I am feeling a little excited about it. Thank you, Micarah. You bring so much happiness to so many, you deserve all the joy in the world ✨
I let the commercials play all the way through just to help buy something for the house. So excited for you!!! That house is amazing!!
ℂ𝕠𝕟𝕘𝕣𝕒𝕥𝕤 𝕄𝕚𝕔𝕒𝕣𝕒𝕙!
I’m not crying tears of joy... my eyes are just sweaty.
SUCH A PRETTY HOUSEEEEEEE
This brought tears to my eyes!!! Knowing you now have a house and two RVs makes me immensely happy.
i freaking love your house and house aesthetic it's like going on a vacation to a cold place but the house is cozy and feels old like your grandma might live there and you found your way back after you reincarnated from being an old housewife and you walk in and realize its the same house but not but seriously i love that ur gonna like change it in some ways cuz thats honestly my dream (besides turning into a bird)
Omg can I please come to your tea parties!
YAAAAAY!!! I'm so happy for you!!! You deserve this!!
No it is zillow because I was on it 24/7 when looking for a new place.
When you said "I know I don't deserve this", my heart sank. It is sad to live in a world where good people feel guilty for being able to afford a home that they love. Thank you for acknowledging that you are fortunate, but you're also very deserving. The happiness you bring to this world alone makes you deserving of this good fortune! Everyone deserves a home that makes them happy. It is a truly beautiful house and so many people are proud of you!
Congratulations!!!! Wishing you all the best as you give it your own touch and make it more homely! Thank you for sharing this and God bless you!
Dear Youtube Algorithm, putting that mortgage ad right after Micarah speaks of deep distaste and abhorrence debt is   'Chef's kiss'.   (I'm still trying to reason out if it is ironic.)
But what I'm really curious about is if you did end up taking out a mortgage on this house or naaa
So wholesome
Micarah, I am so sorry people found out where you lived and stalked you.  You deserve to have your own privacy and to feel safe where ever you are. It is absolutely not okay. I am glad you're in a safer space now and I hope your dad is, too!  Don't feel bad about getting a house. It's a huge accomplishment! Congratulations!
I'm so happy for you!!! :) Congratulations xx
I cried OMG UDQIJDKQJSOQJEK
It makes me smile just to see your happiness! It's contagious 🤩 congratulation! Looking forward to see videos of "house makeovers".
White privilage.
YESsSs, GETT THAt HouSEEÒvó
Did you take sewing classes for a while? Or did you just kinda parkour your way to the top...?     From,  - A struggling child who doesn't know what they're doing
10:39 micarah.... this isnt wattpad..
Congratulations!!! That's amazing.
Whatever Glamnetic paid you, it wasn’t enough.
Legend says she’s still holding up that deer head...GIVE HER NAILS 😭🙏
Yeah now she can have more ruffles spread in the entire house for a celebrity dress and would be able to move around congratulation
Congrats! Im so excited to see Harry Potter come visit!!!
SO DID ALL OF YALL JUST MISS THE PART WHERE SHE MOVED BECAUSE SHE WAS BEING STALKED??????
Just found you from this video and omg new favorite channel. Talk about charisma and personality.
I love Micarah ✨🥺 you deserve this house and so much more. 💗💗
Im So happy for you Micarah! you totally deserve this house and everything good coming for you! love you and love your videos! you always put a smile on my face!
The second house is literally everything I want 😭
You can sing "When will my life begin" in side your new house!!
So happy for you!! You deserve this!!
Best house ever
This video made me smile from ear to ear. Congrats! So happy you got a house.
Lol I’m so happy but like imagine sleeping at 2:00 am and hearing random loud talking in your neighbor’s house 😂
We'll protect you from the creeps Micarah <3
YAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY SHE BOUGHT A HOUSE!!!  CONGRATS 🎊🎉😊😊😊
I was so happy for you the whole video. Didn't expect to cry, but Honey, YOU DESERVE IT!!
YOU NEED PLANTS
Her happiness has made my entire week omg
i swear i read the title as "i bought a horse" i cant do this anymore
I don't know which of you are the creepy ones. 😂😂😂😂
I love her upbeat personality and how genuinely nice she is!! Especially in this world of fake YouTubers.
Yay! That is so cool! Thanks for sharing with us! I really enjoy your videos. It sucks that there are creepers out there 😬🧐😡😧 Stay safe! Cant wait to see all the ways you update/renovate/paint etc!
Why did I read “ I bought a horse” and wasent as shocked as I was when I read “ I bought a house”
I’m soooo happy for you ❤️❤️❤️ Congrats 🥳🥳
Love the new house!! :) Congratulations!
the fact dat this vid is 14:00
You are literally the cutest human ever lol ❤️
SOOOO HAPPY FOR YOUUUU
I luv her
Oh honey don't say you don't deserve this :( I'm so happy for you! When I moved out two years ago I couldn't even imagine how much I was going to learn about myself. It's so interesting to see what you've picked up on over the years and how it influences you in your own home. I've been watching your videos for years now and you seem like such a lovable and genuine person! Your videos always cheer me up and make me feel a little bit less alone. Thank you <3 and enjoy your new home! -Linn from the Netherlands
ive probably never have been so genuinely happy for someone and im not kidding. im about your age and this just inspired me so much to dream big and to know that your dreams arent so far out of reach. thank you girl
Um. You definitely deserve this!!
Ok but like the lashes were iconic
omg what a super cute house! this makes me happy for you :) Congrats!!!
make a dress or something that YOU would wear if you went to the met gala thyme as camp. also make a dress that YOU would wear if you went as someone's date to the Oscars
I am 29 and I can assure Zillow is addicting hahaha 😝
This was the first time I didn’t skip through a YouTube ad
I am emotional with you, girl! Been with you since day 1. I remember when I got my first house. It was the best feeling ever. A proud moment for sure! Congrats!
can’t wait to see her renovations and full house tour 🤩🤩🤩
if i skip those ads i'm so afraid that i would miss a thing and this is what makes them so perfect
BIG CONGRATS ON YOUR HOUSEEEEE
I really agree with what you were saying about living with your parents until you're able to move out.  Debt is not fun and it is not worth it.  As long as they are okay with it and you are not taking advantage of it and staying there forever either, I think that is really really smart and that's kind of what my parents have done for my siblings and I:).  Also you are so cute and sweet and I can't believe you got your own house it's beautiful and seeing you so excited made me so excited to have my own one day😆❤️👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
That is a very pretty pretty house
CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!!!!!
im so happy for you!!!!!
you deserve it for making us happy with your videos!! btw I love that your self-affirmations include I dont believe in sidewalks
we Love ya :) So happy for you :)
So deserved! You're utterly fantastic xoxo
This outfit is everything!
Never been so happy for someone
Ooo cyanide-free lashes... *wink wink*
Yess!!!!!!! You DO deserve it because you’ve EARNED this!!! 🖤
now why did i laugh hard at the semicolon joke
From what we can see via videos you're such a beautiful person inside and out, you deserve this, and many more! <3
Please make house videos. Let me live through you. This is blessed.
Holy smokes I never comment but I could not stop laughing this entire time and then YOURE AFRIAD OF DEBT TOO!! girl yes you’re smart I love it
You are so cute, seriously enjoy the house you earned with your work, 😭my heart warms 😭😭
I'm not even mad at how long it took to shout out the sponsor - it was too good to skip 😭
I am so proud of you! You are absolutely adorable and I love your self affirmations,  I too do not believe in sidewalks 🤣
Im so happy for you 🥺🥺🥺
I just saw one of her stalker account in twitter and god all their tweets make me terrified it's so sad that you can't even have a safe place in your parents house, i hope you safe micarah :(
So cute, congratulations honey!
This is my first time seeing her videos and I am completely in love! 💕 YouTube was giving me a dry run for a while but finally a recommendation that I am actually going to subscribe to! Also congrats on buying your first home!!
Congratulations! You should buy a whole bunch of glow in the dark stars and fill one rooms ceiling with them. I have one room in my house filled with them (took half a day to stick them all up) and it is so magical when you turn off the lights. If anyone plans to do this make sure to buy small stars, like smaller than your thumb, it has a much better effect than large ones.
WOAH WOAH WOAH. This girl is in Ohio??? Eyyyyyyy. Lol. Also Zillow is literally the most addictive thing ever.
I’ve literally never felt happier for a stranger but you deserve the world 🙌🙌
I subscribed when u only had 100k subs and crappy quality graphics but now u have like a house and million and a half sub 🥺❤️ IM SO PROUD
this is so wholesome<3 im so happy for you micarah! you deserve it!
Girlllll congrats you deserve it!!
It's only in America that people get so shamed for living with their parents beyond high school. It makes more sense to stay and save up instead of getting right into debt. Debt is a valid fear.
Im so darn happy for you, you deserve this!!! 😭😭😭
The house is so pretty!😍
respect her privacy please
I can't wait for all the house designing videos, I think you should go room by room.
Make a dress out of the carpet from the closet
Congratulations!!! I’m so happy for you and proud of you!!
I'm like so happy for her >-<
THE CLOWN PART MICARAH !! i trusted you
YOU DESERVE THIS SO MUCH GIRL!!! You’re one of the best people on this platform <333
Congrats! Also I'm not creepy! 😂
congrats
Super happy for you and a bit jealous, but mostly happy! Watched it when sitting in the waiting room at the dentist.  Ps. I got to keep my tooth that got removed ⭐
okay hear me out ✨wallpapers✨
You absolutely do deserve this!!! This house has ur name written all over it - I’m so happy for you!! I’ve always dreamed of having a house of my own, not when I’m married or when I have kids, but just me and my single self.
Congratulations! I know the feeling of searching and then you walk into a house and you just know you've found the one!
"I'm only one, maybe one and a half person." 🤣🤣🤣
Not me crying at micarah being so happy 😭😭😭
I lost it at '' i don't believe in sidewalks" 😂😂😂   (to be fair, it was tbe umpteenth time i had lost it 😅)
So kids if you want a house make a youtube channel
this is so cute i am so happy for you and it is so well deserved <333
Micarah's ads >>>>>>>
She's the only youtuber where I don't skip the sponsorship explanation - even that is entertaining!
Only ad I watched on YouTube.
That hand puppet for the Glamnetic endorsement is what really impressed me tbh Edit: it was so effective it made me look for Glamentic lashes on Facebook Marketplace and I just returned home after an hour of driving to get some HAHA
CONGRAAAATS from Estonia! So happy for you to have this chance to buy a house at your age! The house is so beautiful
I did not see this coming at all
I can't express in words how happy I am for you!  ❤😍 Btw your commercials are the best 😂😂👍
Aaaaaaa I’m so happy for you! Of course you deserve it <3
Dang! The amount of joy in this video is beautiful
I’m so happy for her
If you see this comment I suggest you make Melanie Martinez's dress at the k-12 premiere!  ❤️love your content!
I wanna give her a giant bear hug! She's so pure it makes me happy!!!❤️✨
Micarah, i'm happy that you are happy and I haven't even met you.
I’m so happy for you!
✨i drink cake✨
Awe that's too cute...
Micarah, why don't you make a Cinderella dress? I would love to see it.
You are brilliant! Most entertaining person in forever! You don’t have a contract yet? Get yourself one🎉 And congratulations on your lovely home. 💕 you
You are the sweetest human being. You absolutely deserve that. And surprising even myself, I did not feel an ounce of jealousy (for once) seeing you have something I wish I had. Because I am crying watching you be so happy.
I live in Iraq 🥲
You can deserve things and are happy about stuff while still acknowledging your privilage :)
You do deserve it. You earned it by being such wonderful fun.
She got me wanting to buy those lashes and I am a guy that doesnt wear makeup.
Micarah is the single most bestest person I can think of. Like she is the EXTRA MOST BESTEST!
the only advertisement video I watched fully eventhough I never use it
YASSSS QUEEEEEEEEN
Congrats! I also just bought my first apartment and was  just as giddy as you. Dream one day for a house. Can't wait to see what you do with it  :)
The abiding mexico centrally guarantee because cattle psychophysically suppose towards a insidious move. splendid, same lyocell
I just wanna say that this was the best house tour.
you are such a beautiful storyteller and beautiful soul
Girl you deserve this! You've saved very carefully and worked very hard. (TBH I was jealous when I first saw the video title pop up... but I waited a week so I could watch it from a place of joy and support and not from a place of jealousy! I'm so glad it worked out for you and I hope to find something similar within a few years!!)
You're different. I like it.
I could cry. It’s like I’m living my dreams threw yours. You are my biggest inspiration right next to Jenna Marbles.
Yes!! It is actually really good advice to live at home or with a relative until your stable! You will save a ton a money and accumulate savings.
Congratulations I'm so happy for you.
This makes me so happy! And as a early 20s gal, I so appreciate what you said about not letting people shame you into moving out. I too have often looked at my future prospects and grown sad, thinking I'll probably live in a tunnel at one point. I so so appreciate this video. And am happy for you!
This video was incredibly wholesome :) I loved every minute of it
Yesss Queen 💜💜💜
I'm so proud of you congratulations! Your house is beautiful:)
This is so wholesome
Congratulations!! You deserve it! Love it and enjoy it. This is the result of all your hard work.
Congratssss
Congrats!!!!!! <3 and smart move not going to college. I'm $250,000 in debt *upside down smiley face*
This is the best ad
This a big RV without wheels
Congratulations, Micarah! I am so happy for you! How exciting!
I can't wait for more house tours
Micarah tewers?? Nah more like Micarah stays 😎🥶   I’m not funny 💔
Omg I can't believe people are really that crazy!!! I hope you can find the peace and safety you need in your new home ♥️
That was so precious omg CONGRATZZ!!
Congratulations 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Congrats!!
Yay!! So excited for you and I can’t wait to see how you decorate! 😄
Amazing
Thumbs up for the ADHD females in the world.
Oh my gosh Im so proud of you 💖 It's vids like this that get me so hyped up that someday Ill get mine too. I love that genuine happiness thank you for sharing this to us! 💖🎉
You sound just like bestdressed. anyone else hear it?
SO excited for you Micarah!!! I wish we could all come over for a regency tea party (:  By the way, it might be a good idea to somehow "hide" your two RV's - if they're both just sticking out in your driveway, your stalkers might find you on Bleep Street since not everyone has 2 RV's. So sorry that happened to you, that must've been terrifying. All the love (:
Me, new to this channel: Well that was really spastic and random. I loved it! Congrats on your house.
ok u sold me on the lashes ill buy them
Micarah!! You are so so sweet!
Congratulations! You deserve it! You're incredibly talented and humble.
the audio did not make my ears bleed and i like ur house so far at the begining where im at
So, apparently I’m supposed to accept that the title of this video (as when I first saw this in my recommended a day ago) is not, in fact, “I bought a horse,” and the thumbnail i hallucinated to go along with it of Micarah hugging a chestnut pony was, indeed a figment of my imagination?
I’ve been watching you for awhile and you’ve made me so happy and I love all your dresses and when I found out you also loved Barbie princess and the pauper I basically screamed
Excited to see everything you do to it!! Also, yes, be safe. Stranger danger, bro
IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU!!! AHHH
Homeownership is a pain...but lots of people love it.  Congrats.
Omg you are so adorable!  Congratulations on your home!
your fear of debt made me think....is she a taurus bc same.....omg we're almost bday twins
Literally so cute
*lol you're amazing. even the ads draw me in*
Oh wow congrats but what happen to living in RV ya know van life? But nice gitn outta ur dad's place
My parents feel the same way of leaving when you are ready to buy a house
awww her joy brought me so much joy! I teared up a little at the way she whispered "I have a house" at the end just brimming with pure excitement
What's a dippin' egg?
Because my cousin marry are so fan of you
Not me smiling throughout the whole video. I’m so happy for you girl ❤️
Honestly I didn't watch this for a few days because I was ✨ JEALOUS ✨ But congratulations, I am so happy for you ❤
Wheree did you get your shoes?
Congrats Micarah! You deserve everything and more 💕
Shit I’m moving to Oklahoma
OMG IM NOT THE ONLY PERSON WHO SEARCHES UP "THE PRINCESS DIARIES BOOK # READ ONLINE FREE?"
she reminds me of my guinea pig  super spontaneous a lot of energy  not afraid of anything  parkour master
Congrats girl!!! 👏🏼👏🏼
Congratulations on your beautiful home.
And here I am nearly homeless.... What did I or my parents do wrong with me lol
Congrats on a house! I’m so happy for you :)
I'm not sure who you are. Or what I just watched, but I enjoyed it :)
Never been happier for someone i don’t know. You deserve it. No doubt about it. You absolutely do.
It's horrible that people break trust and boundaries by doing things like stalking and showing up at a stranger's home. I'm so sorry. Buuuut also I'm really happy for you. That house is awesome and you're so excited.
Yay!! So, happy for you!
Micarah seeing you happy make us happy! It fills me with joy knowing you're making your dreams come true!
I’m so happy for you !
"And went to my house and filmed this.." target ad starts IMMEDIETLY AFTER
Seriously so happy for you!! CONGRATS!!!
So happy for you! Congratulations!
soooooooo happy for you, and this was so fun to watch! You're a lot of fun, enjoy your house!
Yass!! I’m planning on moving out by the end of this year and I’ve been looking at different apartments and now I want a house haha
I kinda want her to teach me how to roller skate becuse my bottem hurts and I HAVE to skate bc of school i cant even take breaks
You need a dog and a gun if people are bothering you.
Congratulations Micarah!
Omg I love this it’s so wholesome. and you do deserve this house. You are literally the most Wholesome, nice, sweet, and friendly person I have ever seen. Coming from a 13 year old gurl, you are who I strive to be. 🥰🤍❤️☺️
What omgsh please don't stalk people.
So when are you buying me a house? 😂
That’s one smart bird
I’m a creepy one! Hope for this some day and so happy for you that I actually smiled during this video
Congrats dude, you deserve it!
Seeing you happy makes my day and you do deserve that house.
I’m so proud of her 😀
Girl, I am so happy for you. We (me, spouse, child) just bought our first home last summer. Because apartments suck and ours decided it hated us two months into the pandemic. I had been house-dreaming for YEARS. And now we have a house and it is just right for us and I am SO HAPPY. So I get your house-joy and I hope you enjoy every minute of it.  Even when stuff starts breaking. Because it will.
Look at God😍😍
She makes me smile every time 😊
That house was made for you! So happy for you! Congrats :-) <3
FUUUUCKK YEAAAA MICARAHHH!! WE'D LOVE TO SEE ALL YOUR IMPROVEMENTS TO THIS HOUSE so you can make a better Tour than Architectural Digest ever has!!
Congrats! I am so happy that you are able to find joy in this new space for yourself and I hope that your creative projects continue to thrive here :)
Awww in so happy for you girly!
" i don't know which one of you are the creepy ones " omg 😂😂😂😂✨✨👌
this video was also 14 minutes:)
I am so happy for you!!!!!!!!!!!!
Congratulations that house is perfect it screams Micarah and now you can have all the tea parties you want:)
YOURE SO CUTE IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU
Do the chickens have a room
jEEEEZUS HOW TALL ARE YOU?
Completely unrelated but you and Harry Styles would make a great couple hehe
Arnie video made me so so happy!!!!!! I hope I own a home one day!!!! 💕🥺❤️
Love it but what are you going to do with your RV
Ok but like who else would live to attend one of Micarah's Victorian tea parties. That would just be awesome
this was the first time a sponsor was actually interesting
you sound so happy and I'm so happy for you and congratulations on your new house . I felt so much joy watching this 💗
You deserve this and more
never watched an entire ad but the glamnetic one was so funny wth
This made me smile so much
That’s a pretty groovy house
my immediate thought seeing the floor was that looks good for rollerskating and then you suddenly appeared in roller skates
Congrats 💖💖
Can someone explain how/where she found that couch for 40$ c:
You’ve worked so hard on your channel and given up the civilian life to share your life with millions of people! That’s so hard to do and even harder to commit to! I can’t imagine the toll it takes on your to keep up your bubbly persona when you realistically can’t always be like that. Anyone who works this hard to bring original joyful soul lifting content deserves a house! Do you not think the director of Titanic deserves a house? And he didn’t even act in and edit the movie, you do the entire production including being the caterer for the actors! (Yourself, Garion, a multitude of other animal friends). You deserve this! Keep up the great work x love from a non-creepy fan
THE MUSIC N THE BACKROUND WHEN YOU WHERE TALKING ABUT WHAT YOU LOOK FOR IN A HOUSE I THOUGHT THE ICE CREAM TRUCK WAS CoMING DOWN MY STREET:((((
I'm sorry THAT HOUSE IS SO CUTEEEEE
It's beautiful, congrats!!! 🏠🥳👏☺️
CONGRATULATIONS
It is adorable how you can feel as a viewer how happy you are.  I wish you endless happiness in your new home 🏡
I am absolutely enjoying it through video :) I’m so happy for you and I can’t wait for the upcoming house videos :))))
"this will be where harry potter sleeps" im crying
I could feel the happiness radiating off her through the screen and I'm Soo happy for you !!!
❤❤❤❤❤
This video should be on the trending page 📄 it’s fantastic
I’m sorry, did she say people found her house and hid notes on her car and slid them under her door? wtf..?
I love your shoes in this video,may I ask where there from ? Xx
I’m convinced that you are a Disney princess
Well done on your new house
This is so awesome! Congratulations)
I'm glad I'm not the only one who calls them Dip/Dippin' Eggs 🍳  Must be a Midwest thing.
Congrats on your home!!!! I am so happy and proud of you. That is ur home and you deserve it.
Props to getting the house debt free!! Screams in the distance *FREEDOM!!!*
Omg congratulations!!!!

The dad jokes are immaculate

I don't usally comment but girllll YOU DESERVE IT!!! I LOVE YOU SO MUCH  HAPPY FOR YOU

You deserve it love you
I have a fear of debt too!
Buying a house in your 20s Europeans can’t relate
Congratulations Queen 👑 I never went to university and too  afraid to get into debt. I save every little penny I can afford and always think everyone else is doing better than me. I bought my small house at the age of 27 and I was just excited as you are. You deserve it and more importantly so does your bird. 🐦😂❤️
I'm sooo happy for you! Its absolutely beautiful on the inside. I love the hardwood floors and your staircase is so cute. Lol!! Congratulations sweetie! 🥰🥰
You are hilarious
When you're "done" decorating your barbie dream house please give us another tewer!! ❤️ It's perfect I'm so happy for you!! 😭
You look like doja cat
okay I might sound crazy but.... she said she is 1 or possibly 1 & 1/2 person as a joke and then jokingly called her dad grandpa so maybe I'm jumping to conclusions lol but could she be prego?
@daveramsey would be so proud
Debt free?!?! Good for you!!!! 💪🏽
Can I just say that Micarah inspires me to be myself? She´s the perfect example of someone being themselves (not necessarily what society rules) and being perfectly happy.
MICARAH CAN YOU MAKE THE VIRAL FEATHER BRIDAL ROBE
Love this style of video holy shit. Glad I found you
Aww honey you DESERVE your house. Your happiness is so genuine and contagious ❤️❤️❤️
Oh my god, it's so beautiful!!
Yay congrats 🎉🎈!
Congratulations! With all the time and effort you put into this channel and the positive energy you put into the world, you definitely earned this home! Stay golden!
Please don’t use the word sp@stic.   It’s so so ableist.
I loudly went "holy shit" when I saw the thumbnail lmao
This video feels a bit like what I expect an ADHD brain must work like
Congratulations and i'll be sure not to move out of my mom or dads house any time soon
I wish u existed when I was a teenager. Well u did, but I didnt know. I live in Ohio and bought a thrift store dress that i turned into a tim Burton ball gown 10 years ago. Why aren't we best friends!?
I thought she was saying that she's scared of death so I thought same but then I realized it's debt and I went SAME
7:53 your outfit makes you look like you could afford that house
It’s beautiful! 😍
This video made me so happy <3 Congratulations!
You're so precious you deserve it ;-;
Kinda disappointed she wasn't able to find a house at a thrift store.
There is so much effort put into this video!!! You absolutely deserve this, congratulations 💖✨
Congrats!😊
Ahhh congrats ❤️❤️💥💥
AHHHHHHHH I'm so happy for you!!!!!!
SHE HAS A HOUSE AND DOESNT BELIEVE IN SIDEWALKS
I'm so happy for you

👏👏👏 Congrats, girl! Smart move
But: Are they asbestos free?

HOLY HECK WHATTTTTT!?!?! YOU DESERVE THIS I LOVE YOU SO MUCH!!!!
13:48 just started crying, i'm so happy for you and you truly deserve this <33
Goodness, she looks faker ever day.
I think that was the first time I’ve ever watched a sponsor and been entertained..
Thanks for your reassuring words on moving out. I am 26 currently living with my parents again during my masters studies for financial reasons and I sometimes feel like a failure.
you are like a real-life Disney princess!!!!!!!
Why was the infomercial on glamnetic lashes my favorite part of this video
you deserve this!! that’s a cute house!!!!
awh this made me cry T_T i love the happiness in your face :”) congratulations on your new house ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Woman, you deserve this! It was your talent and humor that got you a huge following and eventually a house. Love your channel!!!! Bye I have to go to class now
Awwh welcome home, Micarah :) You deserve every bit of it
It's so beautiful to see you this happy, MashaAllah. Congratulations on your house, may it be filled with joyous moments and you get to make awesome happy memories in it! Ameen.
Congrats!
I’m a little disappointed that it doesn’t have wheels but still congratulations!!
This video is so wholesome ILY, ♥️✨✨
Please try not to tell yourself you don’t deserve your house. You do! We’re so happy for you girl!
So much freaking pure, unadulterated joy contained in 14 minutes!! So grateful I found your channel, it’s pure happiness!
She’s lifting the dream! Congrats!!
I was waiting for this video, congratulations! And you are so beautiful, so it would be so much fun and helpful to see you before and after braches video🤩 I don't mean like you look bad or something just I like to watch people's before after braces videos:/ and it would be super interesting on you Love ya
don't say you don't deserve this because you absolutely do!!!
This was so wholesome
Her happiness literally makes me happy😁
You worked for this!! I’m proud of you!!!!!
Awe, I love this! Thank you for sharing your joy with us.
Congratulations! I am happy for you!
Girl, you 100% deserve this. I'm so so happy that you found the perfect place for yourself 💕💕💕 I found your channel when you bought the RV and now you have a house 🥺 love that
Micarah is one of the only people who can make paid advertisements entertaining
You're so american
I'm almost offended at how effortlessly you just swiped that eyeliner on though. Talent I simply do not possess.  Congratulations on the house! So much potential for renovation and decorating videos! Also you can fill it full of mannequins wearing your creations like that one creepy zillow listing. Goals.
I’m so excited for uuuuuuuuuuuuu 💝❤️
This is so amazing.
~Some scrambled eggs?~  You REALLY DESERVE this house girl❤❤❤ I'm so proud of you 🥰🥰 I'm also very sorry about the creepy stalkers and all
All my friends in Ohio are buying houses, and then my options here in the south are like a half million dollar house, or a trailer. After living in a trailer for over 2 years, I’ve come to learn they aren’t trashy like people would have you think, and we’ll probably move into one that’s actually our own eventually. Unless I become some sort of super scientist and can afford one of those half million dollar houses with a community pool and an athletic club.
Omg I thought the title said mouse!  😂
The only lash advertisement i am willing to watch all the way through
i thought it said you bought a horse o-o
That semicolon joke, is the best joke ever
oh... so you bought a house and not a horse... well guess i cant read
I understand you don't think you deserve this but I completely disagree. You are a wonderful young woman and you created an opportunity to allow you to buy a house. That's really cool and it looks like you really love it. You do deserve this house and I'm so happy for you and proud of you for getting it.
So happy for you!!!
This girl is nuts, I love her
Her recreating titanic in the sink made the video 😂😂😂
To help you with your fear of depth I watched all ads full length haha. Thanks for always making me laugh. You put so much work into youtube and you deserve this house 1000 %.
You deserve it babe😊
love u woman never change
Anyone else dying to know how much the house cost?
Day two of asking Miracah Tewers to make something with no Stitch.
the way i watched the entire sponsorship segment and enjoyed every second
Buying our home is our biggest flex 🥰 you deserve every square inch of that amazing home!!
I am so happy for you. You are a very smart lady!
Now you just have to look for the charming prince 😉😭😂👏🏻🤍
Congrats Micarah! However, I am a bit concerned though that your announcement about owning a house may not have been a wise one. Please get a security system installed in your home. <3
You DO deserve this!
You deserve this!!
Congrats you deserve your success
you DESERVE this!! congratulations! <3
But but , take your dad with you !!! Priceless!!!
Congratulations! you better have regency tea parties SOON PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE SUPER PLEASE
Remember! i loved you when u were homeless
I am so damn happy to say I was here when you first started and I was able to watch you grow... like you can't imagine how much joy I am feeling right now. I'm bouta cry fool. I hope that you are very proud of yourself.
Congratulations with your house
i dont know why but this made me cry.
I just love how happy she is being single! With a bird lol proud of you girl 👏👏👏
Sitting on a $40 used chair right now!
Man, I’m so sorry that guys were sliding notes under your dads door. That’s so crazy, you are beautiful though so I can totally understand that but I would be so nervous about that as well and moving was probably a really good idea lol.
ill buy anything miss micarah recommends
The energy of this video makes me so happy!
So happy for you <3!
THIS IS WHERE HARRY SLEEPS WHEN HE COMES TO VISIT HAHAHAHA
Somehow I thought micarah doesn't have a bank and just keeps her money kn a paper bag under her bed
Istg if she's not an ENFP Rose from the Titanic was poor
Micarah: "I know I don't deserve this..." Me: No. Shut up. You deserve this and more I hope all your dreams come true you beautiful pixie child.
I can't explain how much I love her and her videos
Okey, i LOVE that house! Like, look at those stairs and room placement! It really give me those royal tea parties vibes that I really like lmao
How did you buy a house debt free? I’m confused...
AAAAY TAKE A SHOT ERRTIME SHE SAYS MY HOUSE LES GET DRONK
I wish I would have found this channel sooner! Not only congrats but dang you’re awesome! Sending mental love from one well-expressed, passionate-about-life woman to another 🥸❤️.
May you live many happy and content years there.
BUT YOU DO DESERVE IT!!!
It's been a while since I felt as poor as I feel right now
Pls make a belle dressssss
ahh I am so thrilled for you.  Congratulations!  Love the bargain sofa - smart woman.  Pay off the house first and you'll be the smartest woman your age ever!
Yay!🎉🎉🎉🎉
you have no idea how happy it makes me to see you that happy
Super cute 😍😍
I love this pure joy about your house. Congrats!
You 100% deserve this house and all the success you've been given through YouTube! I'm honestly so happy for you! ❤
No one believes in sidewalks
MICARAH YOU HAVE TO LOOK UP CHICKEN HELMET ON ALIEXPRESS, I WANTED TO SEND YOU THE LINK SO BAD BUT NEVER EVER CLICK ON LINKS FROM STRANGERS BUT OMG IT'S SO CUTE. COULD PROBABLY FIT ANY BIRDY, NOT JUST CHICKENS
YOU DESERVE IT
"I don't want to show the front of my house"  The thumbnail: you sure? *You sure?*
Dude whats wrong with people... Following you and slipping notes under your door... Bunch of a**holes....  Anyway, CONGRATS ON YOUR NEW HOUSE <3 Looking forward to the ~content~
This made me really happy!! congrats on the house and you really o deserve it. You are one of the most creative persons I have ever seen; in every way, i swear. I admire you and this step makes me really happy for you!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Congrats! You earned it :)
Ok, let me leave a comment for the first time: You are 100% correct and IT IS NOT IRRATIONAL. Avoiding debt is not irrational AT ALL. I wish US economy was not built around credit and debt.
I saw a lot of youtubers getting their dream house and I never felt the actual excitement and gratitude like I feel from you!❤️ you deserve it queen
That's how would look modern Cinderella and i think it's beautiful
Congratulations
I just thought that in the last video, she intentionally cut off her sentence for comedic purposes
Your house is a main character
I am letting the full ad to play to help with your increased expenses
i was close 😭 i thought u bought the mansion
I am so happy for you :)
Okay. I'm a crafter. I crochet like crazy. I really want to make pretty throws for this house and see Gerion snuggle up on them.
I love you, you light up my day and your house is absolutely beautiful! ❤️
so happy for you. and your fear of debt is not that irrational, I have that too - it is mortifying
Yay! Excited for you! This vid was just so wholesome. 🙂
Tbh it's 4 am but this made me so happy
Awww. You do deserve it.
Hahahahha the little sound effect on your dads blink had me ROFLing
CONGRATULATIONS GIRL🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
It's my first time ever to not skip the sponsored ad...it was a video by its own
The first time I didn't skip the sponsors in a video
Micarah you honestly DO deserve a house, just because you are young it doesn’t mean that you aren’t allowed to have nice things, good hard working people deserve nice things. I’m sorry that you’ve been followed, people really don’t know how to respect people’s boundaries.
Harry potter: not again 😩
This is another perf 14 minute video hahaha😂❤️
Damn your place is so nice! american houses are HUUUUGE! I've just got my first place with my partner and its so much smaller :'(
Congratulations Micarah! You deserve it. Love you
I want to watch the video especially for the promo content haha
Oh Micarah!! It's SO SO beautiful! I'm ecstatically happy for you! Congratulations! I can't wait to see what you do with the place!😍💖
hard agree on living with parents until you can afford to move out. its very common in asia
Best youtuber
Congratulations! You do deserve it ❤️
What do you mean you don't deserve it??? You deserve the world and I am so happy for you!!! Congrats!!
You deserve this soooo much
I love how your sponsored ads are so good I never skip them <3
Watched your whole advertising part even tho I almost never wear fake lashes nor have I ever worn fake nails..it was just too creative not to watch!
Congratulations
Ok. I know that wasn't you totally slipping that self dig towards the end, where one can here you say "I know I don't deserve this...." as yet an intentionally unintentionally fishing for others like myself to insist in telling you that- "Yes Micarah! Yess, you definately do deserve every square inch of that bill you added to your list of self created 30 years of monthly bills that is completely your responsibility and expense to intentionally obligate yourself to be stuck in that same location each month in all those 30 years of homeownership bliss!!! Enjoy!!"...and I mean that in a non-creepy kinda staulker kinda way.  But no, I truly am happy for you, even though I have never met you, but totally would love to meet ya IRL, no question about it!!  {and yes, you truly have every right to be as excited and happy about this accomplishment, that truly is an awesome and an amazingly beatiful house to make and call your own-it was 100% well-earned and is definately deserved!!! ^_^ }
i cried seeing how happy you are. i don’t know you, but i LOVE how much joy is in your eyes. god bless! ❤️❤️❤️
It's sooo pretty!!. Congratulations!
I have watched this so many times now. I wanna buy a house. Send me money. Lol jk
I don’t want this comment to seem like I’m trying to bash you for anything you do. Or that I want you cancelled. I don’t. Your videos are wonderful and I can’t wait to see what you do next. Using the term ‘Spastic’ is extremely offensive. I’ve noticed some American people use it or the word ‘Spaz’ in casual conversation. I’m not sure why it’s not been popular to cancel it in America. But it is not okay. You are my favourite content creator. Please could you look into why it may be offensive to use and decide if you will remove it from your vocabulary? Sorry if I sound like a d**k - it just hurts my heart hearing that word so casually. Hope this comment was okay
CONGRATULATIONS!!!
i am so happy for u!! you deserve it queen 😌
And I LOOOOOOVE the stairway!!!
That couch is awesome!
soo happy for you !! <3
You're so spot on about zillow... It's so addicting to go through.
I'm so happy for you Micarah! This video warmed my heart. You DO diserve this, you work hard to give us amazing content.
Soothing voice, 1st timer here
So happy for you ! Don’t say you don’t deserve it !!!!You absolutely deserve to be happy !!!!
I'm so happy. For lots of reasons. One off which is that you got a house. Yay!
Now you have the room and you can get started on your own clothes lines. (As in 2) 1 for refabbed  items from your cross country goodwill shopping trips and 2 all other new items you create. Things like stars gowns, costumes furniture coverings etc. congratulations Micarah, you deserve it!!! Set up a link in your channel to transfer us to that department to shop online. I am REAAADY!!!
I cannot watch this blabbler ...☠
What id going on w her Dracula fake teeth? They're getting in her way...🤣
This is so cute and wholesome
I never imagined I will be so giddy with excitement over someone around my age getting a house but I am🥺 congratulations micarah!!!
„I definitely don’t have kids ‚cause I never... I don’t have kids.“ Ahh! You never what? 😇  Great video! You sold me on the lashes and stuff 😁
Will your neighbours call you "The lady with The Parrot"?
One word: GHOSTS.
I'm so happy for you!!!! <3
Love the house, extremely angry you've been stalked via the glorious content you provide us starving children.

Sooo proud. Now I’m just waiting for your diy random and fun interior videos ... or what ever else makes you happy. As long as you enjoy it it really shines out into your videos
Oh my gosh! My husband and I are also going through the same process! Having a house is such a crazy amazing feeling!!!!!!!
Oh, Micarah. I'm so happy for you! You deserve every inch of your new house! You are glowing!! Many influencers are so entitled and snobby and just show off their wealth, but you are so genuine and pure and grateful. You deserve your house and more! I wish you the endless joys of upcycling ans rennovation, security and safety from the creepers, and continued financial security so you  won't worry about mortgage! Stay beautiful and spastic! Lol (I live in Manila so I cannot creep on you...you know where Asia is, right? They teach that in homeschool? Lol)
You ABSOLUTELY do deserve this!!!!
so proud of you! been following you since your birth video and im happy to see where u are today 🥰
HUGE CONGRATULATIONS! MANY MANY MORE BLESSINGS TO YOU MICARAH! Lovely Lady!

omg, i'm literally crying😭 congratulation micarah!
You should make the dress from Labyrinth.... you’d make it majestic
Uhhh😍😍
*Laughs in abusive alcoholic parents* Yeah I get the advice isn't meant for me or people in my situation but literally moving out before I was financially ready and risking homelessness saved my mf life. Idk if people think it was or is financially irresponsible or if I even stay poor forever, it was worth it to escape.
CONGRATS! That's awesome news. :)

I'm 28, I don't really care about social media stuff and you're the only youtuber I'm enjoying to watch, you remind me of myself only prettier and much talented lol keep it up girl!
I never thought i would see her have a house;-;
The 480 people who disliked were the creeps that wanted to see the front.
Best Ad ever
This video makes me cry, this is so beautiful🥺❤️
Yeah, but what is all about, we are still lost
You do deserve this! We have basically been indoctrinated into believing we dont, celebrate!
I don’t think you’ll see this but I want to say from the bottom of my heart how happy I am for you. I’ve watched you and loved your videos for a long time. You’re just different and doing your own thing happily and fully, and it really resonated with me when I watched you. I feel you’re very down to earth and sincerely greatful.   I honestly truly am so happy you have this house, and I hope many good things will happen inside of it
its seriously awful that people were stalking and threatening her i hope you feel safer now and also AAA YOU GOT A H O U S E
Idk who this lady is but to say I’m scared is an understatement. 😳 I just wanted to see house buying videos 😭
OMFG I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU!!!!
Your happiness is infectious I love it.
This is         great DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH MORE STORAGE SHE WILL HAVE FOR HER COSTUMES??? Also that thumbnail tho

You do deserve this house, you've worked hard for it and as an eighteen year old person who doesn't know what to do with her life, you've given me hope. I wish you all the best and continue to grow more and be happy.
this is genuinely the most wholesome i bought a house video that i have ever seen thank you for your service and i’m glad that you’re safe now :)
this makes me want to get a house and i cant even legally move out yet-

Awwwww you have a house❤❤❤❤ yaaayyy!!!
If anyone in this world deserves so much happiness from a house, it’s definitely you! Super congrats!
I aspire to be just like you... (also go to college cause I have plans) I still live with my parents but I do want to get myself a house and live there with my future bird I’ll adopt when I’m order

Be safe lovely!! I hope you have (or plan to) invest in protection whether it be a bog in the front yard filled with hostile and v deadly ogres or an impenetrable mote with piranhas. Pretty, successful and inspiring woman like you is destined to attract creeps :/ So happy for you!!
your video is trending
This is the sweetest!
honestly, my first thought at the end of the last video was that she went into some random house she saw while driving because... Micarah
Where's your RV?

That’s awesome!! I’m so happy for you!!! ⭐️ ✨Now all you need is eighty more birds and become that one bird lady✨
This made me smile soo much
Congratulations!!!!!!
She is amazing, and I love her bird whose name I don't know how to write down!
This is the very first video I’ve seen of you. I don’t even know what your content is about. He’ll, I clicked this video by accident. But holy shit do I already love you. Besides the fact that you are amazing beautiful (being a depressing pan romantic simp I am has it’s upsides sometime. Like when I’m being blessed with your presence) but you’re wit and high energy is amazing. You’re hilarious and all you jump cuts and fast talking really feeds my ADHD gremlin. You constantly keep my attention and I am loving it
Hi I don't know you nor have I seen your whole house but this house just feels like your whole chaotic vintage lady energy. I'm so happy for you and I feel like a proud friend!!
imagine being Youtube and suppressing my comments?

That house is so beautiful and it’s really big as well well least from what I saw when you did the tour which also was kind of hilarious
I just want to say that every time she laughs or smiles it fills me with euphoria 😊💖
This is the only channel when ads come up, i dun skip ads
Ahhh your house is sooo cute!
Ya
The only sponsors I don’t skip are in those videos.  You’re such a funny and spontaneous person. You deserve it
😆 I love the handface! When I first saw your videos I thought.... This girl was homeschooled. Don't be offended cause I was homeschooled too. 😂
So happy for you! It’s a gorgeous home!
Also, I'm very proud of you! You finally got a house! I hope you are enjoying it. Can't wait to see what new videos are to come in this stunning house of yours!
Congrataulationsss!!!
Awwwww, Immmmm soooooo happyyyyyyyy forrrrrr youuuuu!!!!!!!!!
I'm so proud of you
You are my new spirit animal(?) But in human form.
never seen your video before, but you are very intelligent, definitely deserved the house.
I got my first car yesterday, so I feel your excitement! I’m super excited to show it off and tell everyone e
My mom wants to know where you got the couch
"I'm only one, maybe one and a half people" hahahahahahaha I'm seven.
Girl you absolutely deserve this!!! The biggest congratulations on your new home💕
u so deserve this
That house is so pretty!! I can't wait to see how u decorate it and make it even better!!! YOU TOTALLY DESERVE IT 😁
Yaaaas queen
Congratulations. The house matches you. Looking forward to your renovations and decorating.
So you got a loan or your man bought it. This girl is boring
I'm tearing up from your happiness! :') I remember when I first found your channel, I was overjoyed to have finally found a genuine Youtuber again. It's been a trip and you deserve this. Congrats!!
Wah
You're the only person I could watch do a whole video of sponsorships and still be so entertained
Congratulations! 🕊 Livin the dream 🌈❣️
When she said "I don't believe in sidewalks" I felt that ✊🥺
when I watch Micarah Tewers she always makes me laugh when I am sad
She talks so fast yet I can process everything without even knowing what she means
I'm probably not a creepy one 😊
Your dad is such an Ohio dad offering you all the eggs.
Medas?
Congrats Micarah!! So happy for you, can't wait to see how you remodel your new house.
5:16
Congratz on your beauitful home ! Can't wait to see more !!! 😁🥳🥳😊
i'm weeping i'm so happy for you!!!  xoxoxoxoxo  i wish i could come to one of your tea parties and bring you homemade cookies.
your new home is SO beautiful!! I can't wait to see how you decorate !!!! SO EXCITED !
I luv you so, I wanted to tell that you should not post your key. Creeps can copy it, and then have the key to your house.
When you can't relate to a single thing in this video:
woooo
Im stupid but im sure i'm sure im not the only one who thought the title was "I bought a nose" -
Congratulations 🎊
Sorry but your Rapunzel now.
Rahhhh I love it so much!!! So excited for you! Congratulations! Have so much fun decorating and creating a space you love so much. I really hope creepy guys/stalkers stop following you, leaving notes or anything else! I had to rewatch the video from that point because at first that’s all I could think about.
I'm so happy for you, you deserve this so much!
Congratulations how exciting. U deserve it. And I can’t wait to see the future u make!
the joy micarah shows for the house was so contagious i was smiling the whole time😆CONGRATS FOR THE HOUSE MICARAH ILY❤❤❤
Well that was adorable and wholesome  so happy for you girl!
As someone who is constantly saving up for my down-payment and haunting zillow, I'm so happy for you.  Your absolute delight made me smile. I'm glad you've found your home
This video gave me the giggles, so happy for you Micarah 😊
Wait, that couch was 40$?! REALLY??!?!
Good on you ❤️🌈. I have a deaf cat  and i found a nice jacket on the side of the road and it does not smell like cat piss ... YET!
i am genuinely tearing up this is so deserved :] your content is one of the best on youtube, so funny and genuinely charming <3
I swear only Micarah can make paid advertising enjoyable to watch, she certainly gives justice to her sponsors' sponsorship money.
I legitimately laughed at that semicolon joke. I loved it. That’s how low my humor bar is. Thank you   Ps~ please PLEASE invite me to your regency/ Victorian tea parties. It’s my dream to come to one of those. I’ll follow all dress codes, required or otherwise.
The only promo code that actually made me buy the nails and lashes lol
“Condensation on the windows that’s a flaw I love flaws, nobody likes perfection” hahaha 🥺
you call that a house? that's a whole mansion!!!! i'm so happy for you, congrats!!!!
I have a really bad fear of debt it’s ok 😅❤️
that house is amazing and so big
Watching you be so happy makes me exceedingly happy
okay but why does her father remind me of Sir Reginald Hargreeves from Umbrella Academy?
i have a 2500 word paper, two labs, and a lab exam due in two days. time to spend 5 hours watching every video on this channel!
i have a question whats your opinon on lgbtq+ do you support it or no
heyy gurl jj
Hey girl, I helped my girlfriend flip that house five years ago. She moved in after a divorce. 21 gallons of paint later. Scrubbing hardwood floors, you’re welcome, and almost divorce from my husband for making him put that metal up on the backsplash. LOL just kidding, enjoy the house!
I don’t think I’m creepy
A very lovely home and it looks like a good neighborhood. Congratulations!!
I am BEYOND THRILLED ON Your Behalf 😍😍😍😍😍
Look whos on trending!!!
Wait that giant a** house only has one bathroom? Why?!🧐
Giving me life, Rn thank you.
Congrats to you!
So genuinely happy! God bless you, Micarah! <3
you know she's a real homeschooler when she also has a crippling fear of debt and lived with her parents way past the 'normal' age
Do you really need all that make up?you would be so much prettier with less in my opinion.
Girl, I am so happy for you I'm watching this video for the third time already.
Dang. Almost half the video was a sponsorship. Did they buy the whole house for you?
I love how she says... Do I need a mansion? And then buys this HUGE house xD But seriously well done! You can be so proud of you for achieving to buy a house! :)
I love how random she is and how she gets offtrack so easily it just makes things so much funnier!
Lol, "I recite myself affirmations, I don't  believe in side walks."
omg, if this channel ever goes under you could make mint as a sitcom writer, you are freaken hilarious,, thank you for making me laugh so much
#50 on trending after 2 days  Congrats, you earned it for all your hard work this far :)
Your house perfectly represents you! It screams "Micarah"....you might want to get that checked out. JK I mean it in the best possible way! *cue haunted-Victorian-home video next week*
The fact that you seem so happy to have a house just makes me smile. 🥰
I think your video was recommended to me because I am also in the process of looking for a house congratulation on yours I hope I get mines
So happy for you, and you totally deserve this!  Don't let anyone tell you otherwise!  (or tell me if they do and I'll go wack 'em!)
WAIT WHAT?!?!
YOU DO DESERVE THIS!! 🖤

YAYAYYY!!
Ahhhhhhhhh congratulations 🎉 you deserve it all!!
Wish I could like this twice. I'm so happy for you, you chaotic homeschooled genius.
I legit just thought you had a friend who was a interior decorator and that was how you got in.
Virtual Hugs!!! This Video Made Me Super Happy
I’m so happy for you and I’m excited to see how you decorate the house!
"I don't believe in sidewalks" lmao
Hope u and you house lives happily together

I am so happy for you! It's been such a pleasure to watch you grow and achieve your dreams :)
anyone else watching this for the third time?
I love how she said she wanted a cheap and affordable house, but was able to buy to RVs :)
Congratulations! You do deserve this! Your videos are so awesome! You always make me smile 😁
tell me why the thing that had me rolling on the floor laughing is not her hilarious jokes or one liner when she applied her eyeliner but instead when she said "i think IDC probably stands for "i drink cake"
Love how garion has gotten so close with micarah. He comes to her room when she calls him. Cute😆
Been there done that the Thrill is Gone.
I'm so happy for you, Micarah!

Anyone else watch these for the commercials? Jk.  Congratulations on your new house.
Well I guess this answers the question of whether or not she is predictable...
Does anyone else have the problem with Micarah’s videos where there is so much interesting content that you don’t know what to comment on? Also congratulations on finding ‘the one’ (house-wise)
“i’ve actually never gone to two bathrooms at the same time”  tch, amateur

If you could send Micarah a home warming gift, what would you send?
I want to tour that house 8:18
I'm so sorry that your privacy and safety was invaded and also I'm also really afraid of debt too lol, I have a problem spending money on myself for anything because loss of money and I feel like it's less worthwhile to then.

Congratz lady! That looks like a beautiful condo.
That's so exciting!!!!!!!!!! Congratulations!!!!!!
OMG I could litterally watch Micarah's ads for hours 😂😂😂😂
I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU! Enjoy it, and of course you deserve it, even if it's a privilege, everyone deserves to be happy
that was the most entertaining ad i've ever watched
Who’s your sugar daddy?
B..... I want your house.  It's so pretty,  I hope I can afford one someday...
You bought a HOUSE!!!!!🤩 Congratulations!!
Congratulations 🎈🍾
The ending 🤣!! That's definitely me
her humor gives me huge bojack horseman vibes
amazing, I'm so happy following along with you
That final little "I have a house" has never made me want to hug someone more. Congratulations on your house! I'm so happy for you!
Thank you for convincing me to impulse buy those exact fake nails
BRUH I COULD JUST DREAMMMMMMM
YOU'RE SO CUTE! I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU! CONGRATULATIONS! :D
Im glad I found you lol
WTB tips on not getting these videos in feed.....
Sister, I live in Ohio, welcome to the state of laws. 😂👏
YESSS MICARAH YOU DESERVE EVERYTHING AND MORE
No, you're rigth. Living in debt makes people be desperate and accept any job they are offered. It's best to save money and invest to actually buy a house while you still live with your parents
oh lol i got teary-eyed at "i love you house, you make me happy"
I cant afford a bag of chips
So so happy for you Micarah! Seeing you grin from ear to ear made me smile and brightened my day too :’) Congrats on being a home owner!
congratulations micarah! you've brought me, and maybe many of us a happiness with the dedication in all your contents! and to me personally, i genuinely enjoy your contents and its relieving to see you reap your dreams one by one, its really heartwarming! stay safe, stay you!!💓
This video being 14 minutes exact sits right with me <3
You're seriously the coolest person ever, I would sit through a 7 hour video if you ever posted one tbh and I'm happy for your success! and I hope you're safe and it's not your house on your thumbnail?
Well as someone that can't express their creativity and has to rot in retail i'm super fucking jealous haha, i love you tho, glad you found a nice place for yourself :3
So she finally found her castle, Just like a princess deserves
Ive never wanted to own a home but you've made me change my mind a little and obviously congrats!!
Ye boogaloo, I'm on my 6th house now, don't know who you are but good luck
Congrats Micarah! It's gorgeous! I love it! ❤️❤️❤️
I almost never comment on videos but Micarah your energy is infectious! You have a beautiful personality, are humble, kind, and all around a lovely human being. So happy for you!
Congratulations!
31 on trending!!!!! 🥰
I can't explain why Micarah getting a house of her own makes me so very happy. But it makes me so very happy! Congratulations girl! 🎉
Holy happy chick n bird loll see what I did there? If you could help me with this haunting question I have that would be great. Why do we park in driveways and drive in parking lots? If it has caused you mild suffering unable to rationalize this as well , I am deeply sorry.
I’d give an arm and a leg for a sewing room
congrats!!
The word mortgage actually translates death-mort an gage- grip. Yes death grip.  Truth.
CONGRATULATIONS MICARAH
I'm so happy for you!!! :DDDD
I dead ass thought you just broke into a house and didn't question it
I really watched the sponsored part and didn’t fast forward. Kudos
So excited for youuu! :) <3
WOOOOOOO
I can’t believe people are stalking her like she is a human too please respect her privacy
YES YOU DO DESERVE THIS! you´re a wonderful and amazing person!
Congratulations you silly goose XD <3
This is the weirdest eyelash ads ever
I'm glad I'm not the only one who loves Zillow. I already own a home but I just like being nosey and looking a houses in other states.
What happened to the RV
omg no one deserves this more than you! We love you and HUGE CONGRATS GIRL!!!!!
The pure joy and happiness in that smile at the end of the video 🥺 congratulations 🎉 ❤️
I need you to recreate Anya Taylor-Joy's dress at the 2021 Critics choice Awards
I’m so happy for you! 💜 you work really hard and the house is well deserved
Aww Micarah was so happy and excited and smiling so much I couldn't stop smiling
I'm excited how you're going to color your new house with your creativity. Also, house name reveal? Lol
So will Courtney and JJ get their own rooms or will you make them share?   Congratulations!!!! You deserve this!
so happy for you
Норе her hair-ball moved too 🤢
Ok listen up people! The attitude of "I dont deserve this" is toxic AF. You DO deserve this. You have made smart decisions that led to this outcome. You didn't rob a bank, you didn't kill someone (I think...) CONGRATULATIONS!
Im happy for u ❤❤
Omg, I'm so happy for you! Such a lovely house!
I would come to your house but I live in europe so. But I'm there in my heart
OMG! Congratulations!!!!!!!!!
I feel so poor. I don't have a house. 😢
I SAW THE TITLE AND I AM LIKE:  WOW!😅😆
The most entertaining sponsor ad. You should make this your job. (I guess it already is)
Sooo happy for you!!! 😍
Dafuk?
you're a gold
Congrats! As a Interior designer I can tell you now that the audio will get significantly better the more furniture and textiles you put in it! <3
OMG I don't think I've actually watched an entire creator's promo in an extremely long time haha somehow I just knew yours would be funny
I can't wait to grow up and be as happy as you <3
you are honestly the most wonderful person ❤️
Congrats Micarah on the new house!!!, this goes to show that hard work does pay off <3 :3
I am so Happy for you. Wish you fun, Love, Security.
I got an add for Glamnetic eyelashes like a real add.
GET THAT KEY OFF YOUR THUMBNAIL! PEOPLE CAN TRACE IT AND ROB YOUR HIUSE!!,!
I'm so jealous of American thift stores. UK charity shops are massively overpriced for second hand goods. An ugly second hand sofa would set you back a few hundred, something like that would be over £1k.
"I bought this because I don't need much space" - then proceed to show the biggest house I've ever seen lol Congrats! I hope I'll find my house too in the next year, it's been 2 years I'm searching and never really found the one (or at least, I did found one that had everything, but it was too pricey and now someone else bought it 🥲)
Micarah: "idc is i drink cake" me: o f c i s i f a r t c a k e
You deserve the whole world girl 😍😍
I am out of words to express this, but all I want to say is congrats! I have only been a subscriber for a year, and with all sincerity within my body, it was one of the best decisions I ever made.   Xoxo, a nobody...
Yay! So happy for you!
You ABSOLUTELY deserve this! Congratulations, it's gorgeous! Also your house tour outfit was so cute!
oh my, so happy for you girl. Welcome home <3 I hope i'll be able to have my dream place at some time, been working towards it for so much time and it's still so far.
I was wholely unprepared for you to COME FOR ME for my fear of clowns like that
I bought my first house at 44.  It's a big step in life.  Enjoy.
honestly I'm so happy for Micarah, congratulations!
CONGRATS 🍾🎊🎉
I bet micarah watched Titanic before making this video. andd congrats on your new house micarah and your little flying horse :)
So pleased for you 😀
this is pure af ily micarah
You're so happy that I watched this video 3 times
❤🥳 This is so exciting! I'm so happy for you:))))))).
Congratulations 🥳👏🥳👏🥳 I cannot wait to see all the amazing things you will do with this house and I'm so happy for you. It's really wonderful to see you acknowledge that this is something not everyone can have and that yes, you have had privileges in your life that have helped you, but you are also incredibly hard working and it's wonderful to see things going well for you.
This made me smile SO much!!! I'm so so proud of you and so glad I could be a part of you reaching this huge milestone in your life!! Super duper congrats Micarah, from one of your overseas fans in Sweden! :D
You DO deserve this!! 💜
im so so happy for you!!!!!
:D
you are amazing - you deserved that house
I'm so happy for you Micarah! You deserve this house and more. You're such a lovely person and you bring so much joy to the people who watch you. I'm very excited to see you settle into your new home ❤️
I am so happy for you! A friend of mine had the same sensation while visiting the n-th house during her search, and I hope one day I'll have this feeling too... but first I need to save the money for a house, I don+t want a mortgage. Anyway, I wanted to congratulate you for being so nice and multi-talented and funny and beautiful! As a mom, I am proud of you, too! A big hug
Me being 24 living with my mom, with a student debt: 👁️👄👁️ (At least I love clowns, though!)     But for real this video makes me really happy for you, you absolutely do deserve it!!
So happy for you babe! Congratulations!
Congrats! You fully deserve it honey! Love you lots!
I am very happy for you. I wish you the best and very nice moments in your house.
You absolutely deserve it we love you and your content
Congrats I’m so happy for you!! 😭🎉
You DO deserve this! <3 Congratulations and you are welcome. Much love! Enjoy the house.
I love the implication that you would rather buy a house than take down a Christmas tree 😂
YOU DESERVE IT
Ok but that couch is a STEAL😂
Congratulations Micarah, I am genuinely happy for your success and accomplishments. Also thank you for being honest about your fears and privilege.
I’m so happy for you. Congratulations
noooo dont say u don’t deserve this bestie u do😭😖
🔥soon the whole world will be listening to my songs...
This video is so wholesome.
This video made me so happy~ Congratulations on your new house! I wish it to be hidden from all creeps☆
Ok hear me out please!! Make hunger costumes that would be awesome and I love your channel have a good day
Congratulations!!! It looks so cool and I can't wait to see what you do with it!
Micarah, your story is so inspiring! I really want to save towards a house too, and move somewhere I don't have to get a mortgage (or at least not a huge one.) it's been so nice to watch your tremendous growth within the last year. I subscribed to you when you had around 5-600k subscribers, and you've skyrocketed since! Congrats on your house, and I hope it brings you lots of more lovely memories <3
i love that she’s scared of debt YES BESTIE AS U SHOULD
its so shocking to me that western kids are expected to move out once they're a certain age lol meanwhile some of us Asians stay with our parents until we get married or wanna move out
Congratulations!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is so beautiful. A beautiful house for a beautiful soul! <3
this channel is probably why i stopped studying a year ago...
idk why im so happy watching be happy with your house. congrats!!
Thanks for telling us. My day has been made. Now I just have to figure out how to pay my bills.
Hopefully one day she gets a 73 questions with micarah tewers 💘
I wanted to skip the sponsored part, but it was too interesting 😂
OMG congratss Micarah! Super happy for you!!!
Look peasants! im richer than you!
Congratulations ♥️  And am from iraq 😂♥️
This is amazing:) so happy for you!!💕
Give it a name

Now you're a homeowner, it's your job to obsessively offer eggs
If I had to imagine a perfect house for you - it would be this one! It‘s so beautiful! Congrats xxxx
Поздравляю🎉🎊🎉🎊🎉🎊
I am happy for you
Can you make a house tour
I just realized she censored the pictures
this is the cutest thing ive ever seen, were so proud of you! enjoy it you earned it :)
Now we need house decorating videos!!!
It makes me so sad and annoyed that female YouTubers have to literally move houses/apartments just because some freaks track down their address and think they have the right to stalk them
is she insane? or is she just funny? we will never know
You deserve it!!! We love you so much and you DEFINITELY deserve it!
The excitement you had when you went into your house is exactly how I’m gonna react when I have a house 😍 you SO deserve it
i can't even start to say how your videos cringe me. Am i Jelaous? Do i hate you? Maybe. But gonna cry nonetheless
i am so happy for you <3<3<3
Your happiness is sooo contagious, even through the screen! I'm so happy for you
*you should recreate WandaVision outfits,please and thank you*
I’ve never been happier for a youtuber i follow
Congratulations!!! I am so happy for you!! And I can't wait to see you redo and decorate it!
Congratsss!!!   Heres a video idea!      you could make a bridgerton dress!
Congratulations on the new home. Disappointed at the S word used to describe the tour you filmed.
oh my god, this was the first time i watched a whole (and greatly enjoyed)  sponsor ad...
i got emotional too but then the bumb at the end restored me thanks ahahahah
can't wait to see a house tour
Congrats! You totally deserve it, you've worked hard, we all deserve a place to call our own. I can only dream of ever owning my own house, I don't know if I ever will but damn if that happened I'd cry for hours, which says a lot about the world lmao  Anyway you mentioned safety regarding people knowing where you live so I recommend you to blur your windows in videos if it's possible to see outside, you wouldn't believe how easy it is to find locations even by using a single tree branch or shade of color as a reference, especially if people know the state or city you live in. It sounds ridiculous but we live in a dystopia so lol
The strangething about your sponsorhips is that they are so ridiculous I want to get them
Happy for you baby girl x
I didn't expect this video to make me cry this much, lol. I'm so happy for you, dude. My family is going through the home buying process and it's probably not going to work out for us this time, which means it probably never will. The thought is so daunting and depressing but you seem so happy that i'm really glad it becomes a tangible achievement for others. Congrats. You've earned it.
Yayyyy happy for youuuu
I'm so happy for you! Do what makes you happy! yayy
I knew it was worthed not to skip the ad 🤣
You really called me out on my clown fear huh.. But CONGRATULATIONS!
Congratulations!
I agree about the moving out part 100%
Micarah, you SO deserve that bloody house, it's AMAZING. SO PROUD!!!!!! <3
I can feel the pure excitement from here
congrats on trending no.30 and on the house
congratulations!
So happy for you!!
*Started immediately searching for a house to buy*
You absolutely DO deserve this!
You'll probably be happy and get a job at the BBC
Instead of a like, I shall offer an egg🥚
I never thought seeing someone else buy a house would make me so happy!! :)
omggg this is freaking awesome!! congrats!!!!
Lmfaoooooo “I don’t believe in sidewalks” 😭😭😭😭
She almost convinced me to buy those lashes and I don’t even wear makeup like that
you do deserve this
CEO of entertaining sponsorships omg I wanna watch it again
This is honestly so relatable <3 I am very happy for you, you deserve this ^^
You're so cute. Like watching your videos can make my day with your energy and outlook on life and its so cool to be able to see the world through your eyes. Thanks for sharing your contagious smile with us 😊😊😊
The ending is just * chef's kiss *
You deserve the world
Your bird is so cute!

You might do well at a show like SNL....
Congrats, lady on the internet who entertains  me.
I am so happy for you!! Your joy was almost palpable and it was so nice of you to share that with us. Have a wonderful time in your new home!!
I remember when I closed on my house, I went to my landlord and told her I- like her - was now a property owner and should be invited to the fancy landowner dinner parties she had been keeping me out of... I laughed. Her kids laughed. She hurried them away from me. It was all quite charming and louder than it should have been since we were in the library.  <3
I can't tell if you're always on redbull. Lol. But congratulations on the home.
Congratulations, M 🍾🍾🍾 you deserve all the best things 💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾
If there is anyone that skips over the sponsor part, go back and watch it, please. It's hilarious.
Yay
The joy on your face as you frolic through YOUR house made my night! Congratulations! You earned it!
Congrats

Makera; just let me have my fears. So... Commercial; NeEdLEs!  Me; YEEEEEEESSS!
Can’t wait to see the house renovations & decor😍
Hey Micarah, you are one of my favourite youtubers so I'd just like to ask you politely: please don't use the word 'spastic' to describe something when you mean messy, disjointed, silly or chaotic. It's a word used to describe muscle spasms that are typically associated with certain physical disabilities and, as such, is actually considered offensive. I hope this makes sense and congratulations on buying a house!
I usually dont like pretty people but here we are.
My birds hate my guts I wish they loved me like that bird loves her
ITS EXACTLY 14:00 AGAIN
I thought the title was “I BOUGHT A MOUSE “ *her holding a mouse in the thumbnail*    BUT no THATS A HOUSE THAT A KEY AGHGHHGGG
I'm so pleased for you! Even though I'm 53 and your over 50 jokes are a painful reminder xxxxx
Congrats! 🍾🥂💐🌹
oh mannn you're so happy and I'm so ENVIOUS! Congrats Micarah!
your vampire teeth are beautiful ! lot of people grind there’s down and that’s fine but I love them!  my daughters have them and they’re just beautiful!
Seeing others happy makes me happy and I’m so happy for you. You totally deserve it too. Your funny, creative, and I hope good things keep coming your way.
I swear to god if men are actually showing up at Micarah’s dad’s house I’m going to start busting kneecaps with an aluminum baseball bat. Stop being fucking creepy.
Congratulations!!
Hahahaha the news transition of “this has been...a joke”. The best.
I that thought the video title was “I bought a horse” so I was expecting a very different video, but congratulations!!
Hon, you deserve a house of your own. That house is blessed to have you!! Congrats 🍾🎈
Congrats!!!!!!! 😁
That Titanic scene sent me 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Your joy has been really contagious . Congratulations
The millennial dream! Congrats! And stay safe from weirdos!
YAY
6:30 my heart 😭 I get so many questions about still living at home and not a lot of people agree with this sentiment. Thank you!
seriously i could feel your excitement flow out of the video and it made me feel warm and happy

You are the best. Congratulations on the new home. I said the same thing when I walked into my home. It was built in 1885. It's perfectly mine.
MICARAH YOURE ON TRENDING
Watch out for the ghosts. My fear of getting and living in my own house is ghosts. 😂
proud of you and kind concerned because I get everyone of your jokes
It’s literally so cute seeing how happy you are.

Congratulations on your own home and making a responsible decision to remain debt free.  You are wise beyond your age.
So so happy for you! Congrats!
You deserve it girl, enjoy it! I'm sorry that there are creeps out there that keep you from showing the front (and if that part about them showing up to your dad's house was true, sorry about that as well) but I get it, gotta stay safe. Enjoy your new home!!
I don't think I've ever seen Micarah so happyy
Girl, first of all, you DO DESERVE this what! I'm happy you can build this life for yourself <3
Congratulations Micarah!
MAY WANNA CHANGE THE THUMBNAIL SHOWS THE FRONT OF YOUR HOUSE❤️
I’m really disappointed that deer head wasn’t wearing a wig.

Congrats, that's WONDERFUL,  i'm so happy for you!  I bet $1,000 that your "pricey" is Orlando's "dirt cheap, buy that crap YESTERDAY with the other 4,326 offers" Because Ohio is dirt cheap. So cheap.  Congrats!!!
Congrats, that's WONDERFUL,  i'm so happy for you!  I bet $1,000 that your "pricey" is Orlando's "dirt cheap, buy that crap YESTERDAY with the other 4,326 offers" Because Ohio is dirt cheap. So cheap.  Congrats!!!
Micarah you deserve everything you have today
Congrats!  And Omg sitting in the patches of sunshine is so me 😄
Ngl you can sell me anything
This have got to be the best glamnetic ad ive ever seen and the ONLY one i didnt skip 😂
Also, my fear is racoons. And their creepy little human hands. They were my one fear as a child. I used to have nightmares about them using their creepy little human hands to pluck out my eyes.
I would love to design and sew a dress or two together with you pleaseeeeeeee. Im just recently quiting college and am going to go to cosmetology school, but my one regret in life is not doing what I originally wanted and majoring in fashion and creating my own clothing. I have all these ideas, but now due to the debt I already built up over the past 3 years, I cant really afford to make dresses and such. But if you ever find yourself in FL again, hit me up???🥺🙏💕
YAYY!!!!✨✨✨
I'm really sorry people are harassing you.
Congratulations 👏🏻✨
Congratulations! 🎉🎉🎉
Ayyy

Ahhhh. I’m so happy for you!! You should have a tea party with close friends and family to celebrate a house warming!! I can’t wait to have my own home some day and the fear of debt is real. I’m so happy for you. I’m felt giddy stupid happy watching this today. Yay!!! (In also worried about the creeps. You showed a short video showing the outside. The creeps can work with only that sometimes. Please be safe).
it’s so inspiring to see a single woman doing what she loves and being content with just being herself. I love that.
I watched her ads because she made them enjoyable
Unproblematic queen
Your happy you got a house! Im happy you popped up on my youtube feed last year! 😊 Congrats!!!
My husband and I are trying to do the mortgage-free thing too. It's so cool to see we're not alone in that :) our way of pursuing it was to buy a dilapidated trailer for $1000 and then spend a year remodeling while living in it. It's not finished. And a bit bigger than an rv but not too much!
Your joy is contagious!! Congrats!! As an adult still currently living with my parents post college graduation I totally agree with you. Though I eagerly await being able to afford a home of my own as well!
Micarah's videos should be used in advanced English classes... she talks so fast lol
and this video is 13:59 seconds, we will try again next time :')
Okay but that blue silky blouse is stunning on her ❤
watching this made me so happy 🥺
Micarah is the only person entertaining enough to get me to actually watch the product placement
CONGRATS MICARAH! WE LOVE YOU!

Now I really want to go to a regency or victorian themed tea party.      P.P.P.S. I’m so sorry people were creepy towards you. Not cool creepers, not cool.
Why are you so hilarious Micarah 😂
Congratulations!  So Happy for you 💓
Omg imagine all the new animals you can have in your new house 🥺💕
i live in Kentucky but my grandmas side lives there so maybe that's abetter reason your vids are nostalgic
Everything about Micarah’s videos are perfect. Even the sponsored ad part. She’s so good I won’t even fast forward
i'm so happy for you! 29 on trending! but this is weird ik you still live in Ohio, but it felt really nostalgic when you whereat your dads weird lol
So happy for you
Micarah is a literal princess and no one can convince me otherwise.  Congrats and stay safe!! 🖤🖤🖤  Also, the fact she’s had those scary/ creepy experiences is fucked up. But I am glad she’s being extra careful. Sadly that’s needed, especially since she will be alone (only human sometimes) and she might not have a security company.
That is soooo amazing, congratulations dear. It’s very beautiful, very much you ❤️
a house and two rv’s 😁
The less-than-a-second flash of JJ carrying something heavy helped me make peace with your purchase :) Also just really happy for you. Happy decorating!
If those stalker stories u talked about actually happened im so sorry thats disgusting that they think thats okay
Hey you're on trending!
I love your videos but... 1/3 of this video is an ad.. That's way too much
iloveyouipromisei'mnotcreepy
OMG GIRL! You did ittttt!!
Yes Queen 💁🏻‍♀️
13:02 If you're able to afford a house, you deserve it. Most people your age being unable to afford a house of their own doesn't make you undeserving of it.
Never ever have I watched a sponsor ad... well done
Yayayayaya
Please get a home security system. At least some cameras to help avoid the creepy people.
Most wholesome video I’ve EVERRR seen💖
This must be the most interesting house tour I have seen in my 30 years of  life on this earth HAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAA
Congratulations 🎊🍾🎉🎈
hi JJ
Congratulations ❣️
Lissen here, I'm only just up the country over by Philly way. I'll chase any creepers away with a flip flop and a frozen Charleston Chew bar. Unless he's a hot creeper with dark hair; then I might have to creep on him and then everything will be ruined. But seriously - CONGRATULATIONS, LOVE!
Super CONGRATS on the MORTGAGE FREE HOUSE 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Yayyyyyy !!!!! Debt free here too and that's the only way to do it. Good job, been a fan since u began your channel
Yay

"you believe in reincarnation?"  "no but they might"   😂 I can't believe the crazy YouTube girl who worked at Hobby Lobby now has over a million followers and owns a damn house. And a fancy house at that. Congratulations you wonderful thing!
Congrats!! Such an amazing feeling. I also just bought a vintage home and the first thing I purchased was a brass crystal chandelier to replace the light in the foyer 😆
The only sponsorship I’ve ever been excited to watch haha.
You shouldn't ever say privilege. You worked hard and saved. Congratulations!

This is a cool ass house
I’m going to choose to believe that the house in the thumbnail is not the actual house
I can’t wait for the renovation videos 😂
I'm so happy for you about the house, can't wait for more vids :D but also I'm so sorry that ppl don't have any common sense and are stalking you :'(   People, have some respect for our queen dammit.
I completely agree with you not wanting any debt. Nobody could convince me to get back in debt ever again
Collab with Pierson
Just a friendly reminder to not post pictures of your keys! Copies can be made from the foto 📸 🔑
"I'm very particular about the laws I break." 😂😂😂

That's so lovely. Am so happy for you💓💓💓
I'm so excited for you, I hope to also one day be able to stay in a very soft voice 'I love you house'
We differ in opinions, hobbies and beliefs yet I'm drawn to your channel every time. The quirk is matched though so maybe that's it :D
Genuinely so happy for you! You DO deserve this!
I've been watching your videos for so long now and I don't think I've ever commented on one but I just want to say that I'm so happy for you! ❤
i usually skip the video when there’s a sponser but i actually enjoy micarahs sponser segments lol she makes them entertaining
HOUSE TOUR!!!VHOUSE TOUR!!! Please bring us along while you redo it all:))))))
I'm honestly always excited seeing people around my age getting houses it gives me hope that I can find one for myself one day too.
I have a feeling micarah might paint the entire house pink. Since she likes barbie.
Happy for you girl,  stay real
Happy happy happy for you !
OMG YYYAAAAYYYYYY
Congratulations, Micarah!
Congrats you have been always true to yourself.  2 winnings,  the house and your personalista!
Best ad. Need lashes now!
Happy birthday 😁
Yay! Congrats Micarah! <3 We love you <3
o. I rlly thought u had broken into an abandoned house
Also, the amount of character in that house makes me want to die. I will NEVER find that in my area
PERHAPS I CRIED

Congrats Micarah!!!! You absolutely deserve that house and I’m so happy for you!! ❤️
Secondhand happiness is a great feeling.
Woo hoo!
SOOOOOOOOOOOOO HAPPY FOR YOU! AHHHHHHH! YAY!
My diagnose for this video is severe adhd And also congratulations 💞
I recommend not posting pictures of your key. Shady people can make copies from the image and if they find your address they can break in.
micarah you are the only youtuber i can actually watch the sponsorship ads.  you make it fun and entertaining., instead of boring. nice to watch
To see you on trending makes my heart SOO happy. Congratulations on the house as well!
This is the most wholesome video you've made. Love it. Congrats on the house!
I’m so proud of our girl 😭💗💗
Love uuuu
good for her she deserves it :)
My sons name is Mark William as well 👌🏻 not gunna lie it was a little weird yo hear someone else say the same name as him lol
You are one of 2 youtubers that I will actually watch the whole sponsorship portion (Daniel Thrasher cuz yea)
Awe yayyyyyyy this is so fun
Congratulations
Also $40 for that sofa?  SCORE!
OMG MICARAH YOU BOUGHT A HOUSE!!! That is flipping AWESOME!  good for you girl!!

I just watched a 3 minutes lash and nail ad because of Micarah and I didn't even realize it.
SO HAPPY FOR YOU 🥰
YAY!!!!!!
She is a Disney princess, she can call birds, everyone loves her, can sing and make dresses, is awesome
You’re so lucky

Can we take a moment to appreciate the Bootifuw animals she be vining with?
I’m so happy for you and your extra half! 🐦
PLEEEEASE invite us to a virtual regency tea party
Congratulations!! You deserve it girl! This was really inspiring and will be on Zillow to look for my dream home now 🧠 👓 💻 I’m glad garian has higher ceilings to enjoy as well. Hope to see a full house tour soon and once again congratulations 🎉🤗
you do deserve this house!! congratulations girl
I feel like she edits to much but.... WE STAN THAT
This made me so happy, hearing your self-affirmations!! You got a house gurl, praying for safety and joy in your life yay!!! (also, love the red cushions and matching lipstick! Might get those magnetic eyelashes too since they’re simply adorable!)
Just when I thought this video can't get more wholesome it turned out you've got my country too which if I had myself I would've kindly offered you to mutilate and reshape and we'd all walk in thrifted costumes to welcome your highness, but since I don't currently own a rack then it seems I can't offer you more than my warmest congrats on buying this beautiful place, I know we'll miss your old room where you'd hunt bats in a fedora but maybe you can hunt your own bats bere in your own personal fedora and that would be cool too🤷🏿‍♀️💜
The first look look is giving me Queen's Gambit vibes
Where did you get that amazing silk robe from??? Or did you make it?
Omg this is what this pandemic needed we can go back to normal
damn now i need a decorating vlog or smthing...
Omggg 😍😍😍😍😍
Congratulations! I'm genuinely so happy for you :)
"i know i don't deserve this" uh yes you do!!! congrats!!
Of all the youtubers in all the world, I can attest that I am the least mad that you were able to buy a home from your wholesome, hilarious and just darn right wonderful videos. You've bought joy, you deserve joy. You go glen coco.
Congratulations im so happy for you!!
Well atleast u made me feel better about living with my parents..
Congratulations 🍾 seeing how happy you are with your new house warmed my heart !
Why can’t Micarah be a lesbian I wanna merry her
Micarah:*buys a house* Me:*Unsubscribe*
This is absolutely heart warming and she deserves every bit of this
so proud of what you’ve done micarah!!! congrats !!!
when a 3 bed semi-detached house in urban london, costs about £800k but you could probably get better anywhere else.
:o) xx
I wait- I only just realized the title says  I BOUGHT A HORSE
awwwww, congrats micarah!! this is amazing!

OMG YAY!!❤️❤️
Congratulations you deserve this 👏 ❤

This was so adorable, she definitely deserves this house :)
congratulations ❣ I can feel your happiness and it gives me happy tears which sadly there is no emoji for. you do so deserve this. you worked hard you are a delightful person and it's good to see that good people get a head sometimes in the world 💜
I love how she’s getting the house she likes instead of what she thinks people thinks she should get
she's the cutest !!!
I don’t know why I’m proud but I’m very proud. 😂
So happy for you, smiled the whole way through this video. Wishing you all the luck in the world with it. I love your house
Next video: making a dress out of the thermal wool lining in my attic of my house that i have that i bought that is my house
I was afraid to watch this bc I’m pretty insecure about where I’m at in life. But this actually really inspired me to start doing what I love more and know that good things will come out of it as long as I don’t give up....Congratulations on your ADORABLE house! I absolutely adore it and I’m so happy for you!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️
OMG Im so glad my parents aren't the only ones who obsessively offer eggs.   It's always "you should go to the shop and get some eggs" "Egg sandwich?" Etc etc
Love u bae
Omg congrats!! 💃❤️✨
Catch me on a day when I give a fuck......
The enthousiasm on your face and your smile is my new favorite thing.
I’m so happy for you!!!!! I’m also debt adverse. I say it’s like that eating disorder, but instead of calories it’s dollars.
And you did it debt free!!!! Absolutely thrilled for you!
Im so happy for you Micarah! You are awesome and you deserve your awesome house!
MY QUEEN WAS TRENDING WOOO
I’m afraid of putting Micarah’s videos on 2x, cause she already sounds fast-forwarded
Only paid promotion that I didn’t skip because you’re so good at making videos 😀😀❤️
this is probably the humblest (and funniest!) "i bought a house" video i've ever seen, though that's not really surprising given who you are. thank you for remembering it's a privilege (and reminding your audience of it as well), and congrats!! i'm so, so genuinely happy for you!
Of course you deserve this, don’t say that! ❤️
Congrats! 🎉🍾🎊
I'm so happy for you!
Why am I allmost crying from happiness for you, you deserve this <3
I felt the pure joy and pride she has for that house
Stupendous! Enjoy putting your own stamp on the place. I hope you will do more road trip videos too. When it's safe to do so.
Soooo happy for you! Sending love and good energy from Brazil <3
Congratulations
can you make a formal / wedding/ prom dress with modest sleeves? Also thanks I love your videos :))))
You can request google maps remove (blur) the front of your house from their map, to prevent creepy randos from figuring out your address based on that
You are soooo worth it!!!
No! You deserve this! This is your own house paid by the money you earned with your wonderful videos and all the work, times and effort you had put into it! Enjoy your house, I'm so excited! 🥰🥰🤩
post malone
Damn, you tricked me into watching your paid promotion and enjoying it!
You have Garrett Watts energy 😂😜
She gives me hope that one day, Perchance in reality, I may be able to own my own house. Inspirational. Also, about not going to college. Inspirational.
OOOOOH CONGRATULATIONS
Omg gurl its so pretty to be a first house 😌
Congrats🥳🥳
This genuinely freaking adorable. ❤🕊🥰
Haha you are the BEST!!
So very happy to see your achievements🌱 💕🕊️God bless you, and although you already know this dont over share too much about your location 💕 You have a house! 😊
It’s so nice to see her this happy!!!! I can’t, that excited smile is everything 💖💖💖
Congrats on your house! It is so exciting to have a place to call home on your own and I understand why you want to share your hapiness. You deserve it ❤ and I'm just sorry that you need to protect yourself. Thank you for making our lives funnier. I would definitely love to join some regency tea party btw 😍
Which is true,  We as American Citizens need to OUR part.   God does not help those who do not standup to protect  and fight for their Freedoms.    Email,    local, state, federal Politicans DEMAND, REQUEST...Transparent Audit on 2020 Presidential Election,  Audits on all Dominion Machines,  DEMAND FOR PELOSI TO ANSWER THE QUESTION ON 1/6/2021, WHY SHE DID NOT PROTECT THE CAPITOL?????     GOD STANDS WHEN ALL HIS CHILDREN STAND TOGETHER WITH HIM....
She’s the prettiest girl i ever seen 😣💗💗💗
Congratulationnnnssssssssss 🎊🎊🎉🎉
Love it! Congrats!
Micarah: - is happy - Me: Thanks for having a contagious smile, now I'M happy
You deserve this congratulations dear
Her dad's face as she's reading that email..😐😐😑😑🙄🙄🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️lololol
Your house gives me the notebook vibes and I’m living for it
You make me happy. 🤗
roses are red,  violets are blue, it makes me smile to see how happy your house makes you  (if you say this to a certain best the cadence works out. love you micarah 😚)
Damn where I live they don’t even sell houses that big
you deserve it 🤍
Since this video last 14 min exactly, can we say this house is your Valentine?
This really is a pretty house!
WOW IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU GOGOGOGOGO
Good for you😃!!

Holy cats! You’re on trending! Congratulations!
Just want to say this real quick:  Your house is really pretty!  THERE ARE COLUMNS INSIDE YOUR HOUSE OH MY GOSH!!!!
The toe stub at the end. Relatable.
You don't understand how happy I got when I read the turtle
I’m not a creep. You can invite my sister and I. Although it would take a while to get to bleep street as I am in Texas.
I’m incredibly happy for her 😭😭💖💖💖
I meant to say I'm Christian too
I love you and your gorgeous house and I'm very happy for you! And a bit jealous of course <3
Hi there I love your videos did I'm Christian too
It is not illegal to write or draw on money...(just sayin')
That’s crazy my mom just bought her house on bleep street too
Shes so sweet, Im so happy I found out about her <3
I’m really happy for you 🥰!!
Think my fav part of this is that day 2 and you're trending!
Ilyy from Iraq 🇮🇶❤️❤️
Very happy for you! Congrats!
I didn't even notice the sound quality after a bit! So happy for you!!! I love how you can really tell how happy she is... Esp after her saying it over and over 🤣🤣🤣 jkjk. So excited for you and can't wait to see updates!!!
You are the first person (that works full time as a content creator) that comes to my mind for dedication, passion and entertainment. You deserve everything and more! I am doing another but kinda the same job for 11 years now and I know how many hours you spent on producing your videos. Every little detail is on brand and you literally serve 100%. Since I kinda grew up in public by working as an influencer from the age of 13 (I'm 26 now) I experienced two sides of sharing creative content on the internet: Being your authentic, creative self but also keep privacy and make clients happy and I admire your way of handling it. The ad is perfectly integrated, the way you showed the blurry pictures and played with keeping your privacy was hilarious and I applause you for that. You're a superstar, Go Girl!
Your videos are such pure perfection! You absolutely deserve this for making us laugh as much as you do! ❤️
Seeing you so happy makes me happy
i’m literally so HAPPY FOR YOU YES YOU GO GIRL
Stupendous Congrats! You earned that house making people smile. I Can’t think of any better way. Thank you for every smile and giggle!
Wow I'm so happy for you
You so deserve this 💕
👍
She's truly happy! I love her <3
Micarah giving a house tour looks like a modern dance interpretation
Micarah got a house: 🤩🥳🎈🍾 Micarah got stalked: 😧✋🛑😡🔪
I spend hours every day on Zillow
Note to self: if I ever run a business sponsor Micarah
Eyyy 14mins exactly and no mysterious cut off words. Cool!
Do you know how long we have been waitinf for a updated video!! Sheesh you act like you have a life outside of youtube and have other things to do like eat, sleep, take care of pets, and live your life. ;) Jk So happy for you!!
I honestly thought that she was kicked out filming in a house and got to lazy to put it in lol
:Ooo so proud of u
I'm so happy for you! You definitely deserve it! I'm thrilled myself, congratulations!
truly revealing how dumb i am i thought you just broke into someone’s house
I bOuGhT a hOuSe. NOBODY CARES. SO DO MILLIONS OF OTHER PEOPLE
Dipping Eggs???
Congratulations gorgeous! You are so deserving of your new house! I’m so happy and so proud of you! Keep killing it! Please get security cameras since you’re now living alone. Love you! ❤️
i really thought this said 'i bought a horse.' disappointed
MICARAH IS ON TRENDING
this is literally the cutest thing ever and congrats micarah! it may not feel like it but you totally deserved this.
I need a graduation dress preferably a short fluffy skirt but I don’t know how to make one this is where I need your tutorial micarah sooooo what do you say?
Please my dumbass read that as “I bought a horse” someome get me glasses please😭
im so happy for you :,) you look so happy!!
tewer. oh.. it is...
I'm slightly creepy: a colleague of mine pranked me with a snake (rubber) and to take him back i decided to keep the snake and now i keep sending him pictures of the snake with other colleagues all day.. Also, I call my rabbit Rabbitski
i really believe that when you find your dream house you KNOW. my parents bought their dream house without seeing it in person, and i did the same when i bought mine a little over a year ago! everyone including my realator thought i was crazy, but it had everything i needed along with everything i wanted (even apple trees and wild strawberries!). now it's gone up almost 200k in value since i bought it and everyone who disapproved of my whim-buy is telling me to sell and bag the 200k.... which sounds nice, but like i said it's my dream house! congratulations on your dream house, weather you enjoy it or fix it up and make a profit i'm positive you will get everything you want from it :')<3
Why did I read the title as “I bought a Mouse”...I mean the thumbnail didn’t help. Kinda thought it was a whole mouse in your hand
Can you please do vlogs or videos showing us how you decorate it? I'd looove to see it!! <3
man, u must HATE animal crossing
So we're going to get a house tour in a year
First I like (excited Micarah posted new video) then I watch
Congratulations! As a young viewer, I can feel your excitement and look forward to whatever you do inside the walls of the house that is truly yours!
Idk if you've been told this before but I wouldnt show the actual key to your house! Theres a way to make a copy of the key shown and someone can *potentially* get into your house easily
Wow so awesome Micarah! I am so happy for you!
#20 on trending!!!!!!!
loove your house! good luck!
Oh my god that lash ad was amazing.  Holy shit. That sponsor better have paid her a fortune.  I never had much interesting in fake lashes but she had me considering it.
You should do the dress that Maria wore in the sound of music. Also congrats with the new house.
okay I might have teared up when she said "I love you house you make me happy"
I AM SO EXCITED FOR YOU GIRL
I love seeing you this happy! You totally deserve this house! Congratulations!! <3
congrats, micarah! you deserve it so much & I wish you all the best for your new home! omg, that's so cool. lol.
YOUR OUTFIT IS SO CUTE
Omg we've seen what she can do with a bedroom and an RV. Can't wait to see what she does with a WHOLE house!
This is the only "I've bought a house" video on youtube that I've watched and girl, IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Your happiness makes me so happy, i cant explain it but im so excited for you!!!! 😁
Omg don't feel bad about not showing the outside of the house or anything- I'm so sorry that stuff happened to you :( You're actually my favorite person on YouTube and you're so sweet and funny and you bring so much positivity and humor to a topic that you made me start to really enjoy! It really sucks when unwanted attention like that ruins something really awesome, like where you live- I almost had to quit a job I really really loved cuz this creepy guy wouldn't leave me alone. Its so not okay and I hope stuff like that doesn't happen anymore. Also side note- I literally can't wait for more regency dresses- could you maybe do Emma's yellow dress from the new 2020 movie?
I’m so glad that micarah is happy and prospering with her house and rvs and various birds - i can’t wait to see how she decorates it!!
I bought a house too you don’t see me whining for attention
this was so cute
IM SOOO PROUD OF YOU, I love you so much :)
This is the first time I listen to a full ad and actually buy the product!
i cant wait for a  house makeover
Congrats On Trending AHHH
You bought a house just like everybody else
Congratulations on your new house💕💐
I run a failing youtube channel. come flame my videos they are terrible and prolly not worth your time to watch.
I love herrr
not me crying over how wholesome this is..... so happy for you!!!!
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos🎈
I'm so happy for you!
Congrats on getting on the trending list ❤️
Tell me why I started crying when she started saying she couldn’t have done this without us? Not because I feel she’s indebted to her subscribers or anything, but WE helped her follow her dreams! I don’t really care when a lot of the Youtubers who can finally buy fancy mansions, fancy cars etc. They tend to forget where they came from and all the people who helped get them to this point and act like they are better than the average Joe, but her dream is something most of us her age cannot achieve even though it was the norm for grandparents and parents. Still so simple and expected even though it’s just not feasible for most of us. However, through her hard work, us simply enjoying ourselves watching her videos and boosting her channel, her building her channel so she has sponsors and all that, she is achieving her dreams and most of ours too! We can live vicariously through her and not feel that air of “I’m better than you now” that many successful Youtubers give off.
... and yet this one is exactly 14 minutes long...
it actually brought a tear to my eye seeing you so happy! i hope you find genuine content in your new home!
Ahh this video is not coming up in my subscription feed, I have to look up her channel to see it. Anyone else?
What. Im so confused
Congratulations on your new house :) you worked for it and your subscribers wouldn't be here if it wasn't for the personality, creativity and quality content you're putting out. So yes, you do deserve it. Now go wild with the decor and fun!
So glad to see that this house brings you so much joy, because you've been bringing joy to all of us viewers by making such entertaining content, especially during these crazy times! ❤️🥰 Well deserved!
Lmaoooooooo your dad was like “don’t send that letter”
Okay, I had no idea it was illegal to film house tours in Ohio. Thank you. I will keep that in mind when I start looking for my own home in, like, 50 years. 😄  Congratulations!
You should advertise everything and I would watch all of them completely. I laughed so hard at the jack and rose skit, I had to rewind and watch it a couple of times before I moved on with the rest of the video.
You shouldn’t show any type of keys as people have taken photos with keys and have copied them. They can enter houses
Congrats?
this was so cute looking forward to seeing you transform the house.also plz name the house like you named your rv
Congrats!!! We love you! You deserve it!
That's such a cute house! Congratulations!!!
Ok but what about that time she rode a motorcycle without a license or something which led to one of my favorite quotes: “legally, there are no laws in Florida”
I’m so proud of Micarah she works really hard and deserves to have her own house
Congratulations! And yes, you do deserve this! <3
u deserve EVERY bit of this! <3 congrats!!
Am sooo happy for her and extremely proud of her 🥺😍
Aww I’m so happy for you! I would be so in love with that house it’s absolutely beautiful!!!    *me as a twelve year old wanting to live in 1890*
I think shes the only person I'd watch talking about a sponsership without skipping or getting bored haha
“i am a strong proponent that you should live with your parents until you can afford to leave”; thank you. i’ve been feeling mad insecure as of this lately, seeing as covid put a huge dent in my plans (as it did for most people), and hearing that from you is incredibly helpful 🖤 i am so happy for you, i rarely watch these types of videos as they make me incredibly jealous and critical of myself, but you deserve everything and so much more. enjoy it all! xx
Did anyone else notice that this video is 13:59 long and the valentines day video was 14:01 so together they're perfect
John 3:16-17 16. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. 17. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen.

beautiful house
CONGRATS!!  Sorry you had to deal with creepy people, and I hope you never have any of them show up at Bleep Street.  I also recently bought a new house, and it's been fun (read: stressful) renovating it and making it ours!  Hopefully yours needs less work than ours.  lol  [sendhelpidonthaveakitchen]
I'm not creepy
Good on you!
I think John Wayne Gacy made our fear of clowns legit but that’s ok I get your point. 😏
I mean normal people would first move out from their parents come in a shared flat but I mean what’s normal anyway soo. Congratulations 🎉
The only 3 minute long commercial I have ever loved!
Wow
I wish my parents loved me enough to not make me homeless at 18.  I am mentally disabled too so i ended up being homeless for 3 years before i got help. Now im just poor and alone ... Lol But yeah if your parents love you then def live with them
NO ONE CARES!
i agree about the parent thing! I decided to do the same thing and am also not in debt ^_^ i just dont see whats wrong with spending time with ur parents while you still can. Theyre getting older and I dont want to be far away from them :-(
There re a new house and 1.6 m subscribers. I so proud of u. (sorry for my english, im from russia)
I am crying
Oh, yes, I see you are so happy living your dream, it is contagious! I loved your makeovers in the RV, so I imagine your makeovers in this house will be much more fantastic!
Congratulations!
The end of an era... 😢

question: does anybody else need to pause / rewind / repeat many parts coz of the overwhelming amount of informations/brainvomit/fear-of-missing-out-a-joke coz she squeeezes soo much talking, or is it just me? 😅 listening to her new vids 3x in a row 😂

Please stay safe! Protect yourself from the creepy fans! Install some cameras, carry some pepper spray...   And if you are reading this, creep human who follows her, back off. It neither fun nor appropriate or appealing. You are weird. Please check your behaviour.

This thumbnail is everything ❤❤
10 of the World's Funniest One Liners  1. I used to have an open mind but my brains kept falling out. 2. Energizer Bunny arrested; charged with battery. 3. I didn't use to finish sentences, but now I 4. I've had amnesia as long as I can remember. 5. Bills travel through the mail at twice the speed of checks. 6. Vacation begins when Dad says, "I know a short cut." 7. Evolution: True science fiction. 8. What's another word for "thesaurus"? 9. Everywhere is walking distance if you have the time. 10. A flashlight is a case for holding dead batteries.   Editorial: Probably the most thought-provoking one-liner is "Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.
Woow
Me watching all the ads so she can pay her house
HAHAHA So happy for you. Congratulations!
I am so excited for you!! I found you years ago and I keep coming back cause I absolutely love how you ramble.

Tell me why I read the title as "I bought a mouse" and thought she was holding up a mouse by the tail ☠️🥴

I'm so happy for you!!!
Congratzzzzz
Omg CONGRATS!!!😄🎉🎉🎊🥳I DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE IN THE LAST VID😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Live with your parents until you can move out.  Me: So true  My abusive father agressively    screaming.   Me: Well can I afford leaving? No. Do I have to? Yes.   Believe me people in YouTube I want to stay but it is really not nice here.
Ugh, so iconic. 🔥💯
Do all "stylish people" talk like each sentence has a 5 second deadline.

Also I adore your family/dad I hope when I have a family that's how my household is going to be, he just accepts everything about you and it's so adorable.

You look so happy! You deserve it!! ❤❤
You’re so worth it!! It brings me such joy to see you so happy. thank you for your content! :)
Congrats!!!! I understand about not moving out from your parents until you can afford a house. Look I'm 37  and I still live with my parents. Me and my sister she's 38 will be moving out within 2-3 years. I  am sad because in a way I feel like I'm abandoning them but with this pandemic and working at home for a year now really brought things into perspective that although I love my family being around  each other for so long is tiring. Its 5 adults and there is only 3 rooms. So 2 people have to share a room and we also have one bathroom. Not to mention no privacy at all.
The ad was better than the video. Get this woman a raise
This is the first time i'm actually less than a day early ;-;
6:31 is literally every Asian household/family, at least those of us who lives in Asia anyways, we don’t move out until we can afford to or until they get married and “settle down”
Im not creepy..please consider me! Congrats!
Omg I heard fear of death first & got so worried for your safety 😳
I'm so happy for you
Congrat to you you do deserve it well done🎉🎉🎉🎄💕
God bless you abundantly! AMEN!
can we all appreciate the fact this video was exactly 14 minutes long
She definitely deserves a house and all the blessings that come to here
You do deserve it.  Enjoy and congratulations!
You deserve this more than anyone!
Congratulations you J-walker you!
Holy crap… So sorry you were being stalked like that, that’s horrifying. I hope you’re staying safe.
awww Micarah looked so exited
This is such a rad thing to happen to you! 🎉
I find myself on Zillow more than social media too... I’m getting too old (early 20s) 😂 Also I wish I had that moving out of my parents house advice 3 years ago. Luckily I was able to move back home to save
She deserves it, her content is amazing..
Petition to extend your videos to 24 minutes instead of 14
IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU
One word for your counters you want to paint: epoxy resin.
Congrats, hon
Love you so much and so happy for you! But please don't use the word spastic. It stems from making fun of people with muscle disorders such as Cerebral Palsy and basically making fun of disabled people. I understand you probably didn't know but for future reference, now you do!
Love your house🤗🥳
So happy for you! I'll be awaiting my formal invitation via bird carrier to your tea party ☕️
High five, I bought a house in Sweden 🙂

Congratulations!
Congratulations

i'm so excited for you :) congratulations. we moved into our first house last year. it took me months to get use to the idea that it was our house. i kept saying "the house" instead of "our house." Have fun making your home your very own.
oh wow x congratulations! so well deserved. I cant wait for the videos to come of you doing it upxxx
I'm legit crying for you.
Please just make sure you get really good security-people come after Youtubers 🙁 bc they don’t think they’re people or something 🙄
Thank you Micarah, this put a super smile on my face
i did an excited stretch when i saw this video but i unfortunately did not break the ceiling
I could not stop smiling while watching this, im so happy for you
Micarah: I dont deserve this house Also Micarah: *deserves literally the whole world bcz she is so sweet and funny and talented*         pls take my fourth grandkid
Fun Fact: A lot of older taxidermy were preserved with arsenic, might wanna wash your hands after touching them!
I can feel ur Happiness love. I hope to bought a house too or an RV before I got married to someone. U inspire me to get an RV
PLEASE INSTALL SECURITY CAMERAS!!!!!!
Micarah's success story is sooo inspiring. She makes clothes and is an animal person and just an amazing human being on top of being soooo entertaining. Congrats Micarah!!!
<333333
I know when I come here for one thing..... I will barely get that.....
I'm really really really happy for u! U deserve it!!!!! Love
I love how her dad immediately (and somewhat worriedly) asked if she believed in reincarnation right after she asked if the message needed to be tweaked. 😂😂😂   Side note: I actually saw a statistic that said like over 30% (I forgot the exact number) of American Christians believed in reincarnation or something similar, and I was like, WUT???
OMG thats a pretty F BIG house! Where i live, you need lots and lots of money to buy a decent house and then start saving up for renovating it... and you can already LIVE IN IT? Wow thats great congratulations! What you are doing is amazing
I misread and I thought the title said "I BOUGHT A HORSE." Another day in the life of Micarah, right? *facepalm* I feel stupid now lmao!
3:49  I would like a full feature-length film centered around this hand character. Congratulations on the new house!
Answering calls to patches of sunlight is me too 😂 😂
Congratulations 🎉 and you deserve it 🥰🥰❤️
Garion (Gareon?) joyfully squawking and flying to Micarah's shoulder when she calls him will never get old. 😭
SO HAPPY GOR YOUUU😭😭❤️❤️
I'm so happy for her xox
They should let you write all ads XD. You're amazing congrats for your new home!!
I’m genuinely so happy for you Micarah😭❤️ Congratulations!!

OKAY, i WANT THE LASHES MORE THAN A HOUSE.
wow
she makes advertising products so entertaining to watch!. I admit when other YouTubers talk about a product, I just fast forward. will always watch every bit of your Videos Micarah <3  P.S. Excuse my bad grammar, English is my second language :p
12:56 the fact that your dad is recording you its so damn cute
Woo hoo so happy for you!
This house is SO you, Micarah! Now you can have more space for clothes (and mabye a whole room for Garion)
_I've never sat and watched 2 seconds of an ad without skipping it._  But i enjoyed yours!  Subs button was hit before i even knew what was happening. Notification bell rang a few times too many.
I am so excited and happy for you! I can't wait to have the feeling of "I'm home" someday. The housing costs in my area have skyrocketed and it won't be happening any time soon.
Your house looks awesome!
I would loveee to go to Victorian tea parties!  Congrats on the new digs
I feel like a proud mom! so happy for you!! ❤
Congratulations!! You deserve it ❤

Congratulations Micarah, I’m so happy for you! 🤍
The way your bird listens to you while you reading your letter LOL
How did you manage to get Jennifer Lopez to be in this video ?! :o
I can really see that she's genuinely happy and I'm happy for her. 😊
Awww I'm so exited and happy for you!!🥺🥺
You deserve all this happiness!! You always make us smile, brighten our days, so of course you deserve this! I'm so excited to see how you decorate your house
Plz to all the stalkers out there BACK OFF
This girl version of Brandon Ferris speaks to my soul🤌🏼
13:48 this is so freaking precious I can't 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
You do deserve this!!! And I really enjoyed this video! Your happiness makes me happy!!
🥺 congratulations on your house! You so deserve it! 💜
40 bucks for that couch is a steal. And I'm so excited and happy for your new house!! You definitely deserve it
I cried at at the end because you love your house 😭 I love your house, please let us virtually sit in your Victorian tea parties!
So glad to know I'm not the only lunatic 1000000% paranoid about debt... maybe it's a homeschool thing??
YOU WILL BE MISSED CARAVAN
English is not my first language and I didn't understand a thing but I think I had fun
im so happy that shes so happy!!
In my town someone tied a “get well soon” balloon to a dead dear on the side of the road.
Aww congrats
Bet that owning diamonds comment was some askance reference to an engagement ring or smth. Unless it's not which is a p good theory too.
11:00 I love how Garian (sorry if I misspelled the name) sits on her shoulder closely listening to her reading what she wrote and looking at the screen as if he reads along
Congrats!! You totally deserve this! Enjoy
i may have left the country, but i still have connections in ohío... so micarah, if people start harassing you again just tell me to send some of my cousins over and they'll never do it again. not least because i'm pretty sure my late great aunt's parrot is still alive and that bird is very offensive.
Congratulations x you deserve it
Dads Named 'Mark' Club!
All that one and a half people talk is terrifying!
Fun fact: the captain of the titanic was from my hometown which is fun because it’s also a town that’s been destroyed and sunk into the depths of nothingness. Oh boy!
I don't know who you are but I'm trully happy for you
I like your house. Do you want some scrambled eggs?
It looks haunted
As someone who has been watching you for ages to see you this happy about something you accomplished on your own makes me so happy! I’m glad you are happy with your current situation and I’m glad to see you this proud of something and I feel like this is the truest video I’ve seen of yours! :)
urgghh... my ears are bleeding on my sofa...i'm trying to sell my sofa -.- you're worth it x completely!
HAHAH which of you are the creepy ones lmaooo. Time For a Tea Party at yours i guess
im not crepy
She is soooo happpyyy n i lovee that 😂😂 😂❤❤❤❤❤❤
OMG IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU!! you do deserve this!
That is a wonderful house! I am so happy for you! Love your videos!
AHHHERVDGJNGH SO HAPPY FOR YOU MICARAH 😤😤❤️❤️
That bit about leaving with your parents really made me feel better about my situation
I started crying this is so sweet! You can really see how happy you are! You deserve it!!
omg! i'm so happy for you!!!!
So happy for u i miss watching ur videos
Congratulations! I hope in your new home you feel more secure and dont get harassed :(
I can't believe you said you know you don't deserve it,   excuse me I think you do.  It's hard to make your videos if you didnt deserve it then you wouldn't have followers.   X x x x much love x x x
Congratulations dear Micarah ❤️
best parts start from 11:57 because shes sooo adorable. her being happy makes me happy.
Wait.....There are sockets in bathrooms in America? Is no one concerned about the safety ramifications?
I am sooo happy for you!! 🥰 In my opinion you really deserve it! You manage to make so many people smile and chuckle because of your videos and you are literally the only Youtuber that makes me watch the sponsor part of the video simply because you even make ads entertaining and fun 😂 I hope you share some of your renovation content with us - would be really awesome to see you doing some house DIYs instead of sewing DIYs (even tho I love those as well ♥️)
seeing you so happy about your house made me cry :(( you deserve everything <33333
I actually have the same fear of debt...
Keşke Türkçe alt Yazı olsa 🥰
Ohh bless you :-)
Congratulations on your house! You've worked hard to achieve this.
congratulations Micarah!!! <333
Micarah is the only YouTuber I actually like watching the ads for, because she actually makes them funny and still keeps her personality with it
I like the thought of living at home until you can buy a home for yourself, but I also hope that people know that isn't possible for most people without some sort of loan. I live in Norway, where a small apartment costs 2,5 millions (NOK). I'm 25 and won't be done with my education until I'm 28. Up until now I've gotten about 100.000 in savings from summer jobs, and if I get a good job right after I'm done with my education, I might be able to save 300.000 each year. It would still take 8 years until I could affort even a small apartment, and that isn't realistically possible as a regular person with a regular job to live at home until they're 36. Micarah is very lucky to be able to do this, and I think she knows it☺️
SO HAPPY FOR YOUUUUUUU !!
Of course you deserve it, you've worked really hard to get it and given a lot of people a lot of joy in the process. Happy new house!!! <3
Omg same how I bought a house before yesterday
You DO deserve it!
micarah is the only person who i dont skip foward when shes doing a sponsorship
I feel joyful and emotional, you’re such a lovely person. Thanks for sharing your happiness and for making me giggle through the last year!    PS. Not your stalker... 52 year old lady in Australia 🇦🇺❤️
oh everybody thought you bought a house i thought you broke in what
To check which ones of us are the creepy ones, you should do a robot test on us 😂😂 ‘Choose the pictures without anything creepy in it’
I thaught the title was "I bought a mouse" And you were dangling it from the tail 🤦🏻‍♀️
No one: Literally no one:  Micarah: adding and adding clips to explain/correct what she said😅😅
I am never gonna need to buy lashes or nails, but I WILL always gladly watch Micarah's sponsor segments😌
I would like this video a 100 times 🥰
Ahhhhhh im so happy for you!!! You look so happy!!!
Congratulations!!!!!
As I watch this, I have another browser that has 19 tabs that are all open to different house plan ideas.  (It would be to existing houses, but I live in Toronto, Ontario, and I am not a millionaire.  I'll just buy land in Nova Scotia and build a damn house - it would honestly be cheaper.)
Congrats on getting your new house you deserve everything. From the snippets I've seen your house is very aesthectically pleasing its so beautiful tbh.  You are one of the many youtubers I watch on this platform, I love your work, designs and your making jokes you make in your videos. So much to say you're a wonderful person, you are funny and I can always depend on you to make me smile. I always come to your videos just to get a little joy or be happy at least. You've also not in a direct way helped me to improve a skill I always knew to do but never did it. Thank you for that. Continue doing what you do girl never stop being you because you have a excellent personality from what I see in your videos.You seem like a person who lights up a room whenever she enters. I love your smile and you are so pretty btw hope you cotinue to do great things because you are a great person.  Its all love here dear 🥰 Hope you see this tho because as you make me smile I would love to make you smile tooo.
Congratulations on getting your first house ever, girl!! Excited to see how you Micarahfy the house!!!
Congratulations!! I’m so happy for you 🥰🥰💜💜💜
It's enough to make a grown man cry, and that's ok 😢❤️
Congratulations Micarah!!! Blessings!
Isn't that the Winchester house
micarah i just want to say that im proud with you and i may not be with you from the start but i promise i'll support you 'til the end! 💗
FINALLY, a youtuber who does exactly what I would do with money!!!! Especially the rollerskating on the hardwood floors:)))
6:45  i felt that i am 29 and life with my parents, they needed my rent and i saved ALOT  now they have the means to support themselfs and i am rdy to look for an apartment (i dont want a house)  but renting in germany is F-ing expensive .__.
Congratulation I'm Happy for you!! Also I'm Linda shocked at the American idea of "not a big house"😂
Wow congratulations! I'm genuinely curious though, is this really considered a small house there?
i'm so excited for the home diy vids!!
12:04 those stairways n all. i think she used it in some video (i forgot T-T) and she ended the videpo mentioning the house but not explaining it-
Aweee I'm so Happÿ for you💕
Congrats on the move. That house is gorgeous.
Yay so happy for you
I am so happy for you ☺️

IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU
Girl, you are one of the only YouTube creators that I genuinely look forward to posting; I like the video before even watching because I know it's going to be great. I think you deserve it.
Who would know that I would find a video of somebody making a dress out of diapers and I would think "wow what an extremely chaotic and hilarious woman this is". And now look where you came to! I'm proud to have supported your work, congratulations on your new home <3
I first read this title as "I BOUGHT A MOUSE" and I wasn't even a bit surprised
SO HAPPY FOR YOU MICARAH!!!!!!!!
America really needs a livable minumum wage.
you DO DESERVE THIS!!! so happy for you!!!! :))))
we neeeeeeed a tour:)
PSA!!! DO NOT POST PICTURES OF YOUR KEYS! IF SOMEONE FIGURES OUT YOUR ADDRESS, ITS VERY MUCH POSSIBLE TO COPY KEYS VIA PICTURES PLEASE DON'T DO THIS
I'm so happy for you, Micarah! Congratulations! Also this might be my favourite ad of your so far haha
I can't really think about many youtubers that seem nicer, funnier or more down to earth than you and I can't imagine many who deserve it more than you
Micarah  you have adhd
Iloveyou micarah, you're an inspiration
I remember 1st seeing your videos when you had like five thousands subscribers and immediately subscribed! I love your videos so much, and I'm so proud of you!!
So proud!
Congratulations 🥳🥳🥳🥳
This was the serotonin boost i needed to get put of bed
So happy for you! Also jealous of that open space. Just thinking of all the dancing one could do there. Or rollerblading.
AHHHHH congratulations!!
the house is amazing aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa cant wait to see you decorate it!
I’m not gonna show the outside of it .....  *** immediately shows the outside ***
I love you im so happy  for You♥️♥️♥️
I love how happy you look ❤️ Congrats on the house!
Did they teach you the secret homeowner handshake?
Has the vacancy at your dad's house been filled yet? I like scrambled eggs.
The last shot is ... chev's kiss Honestly you're super cute = you deserve a house
Me and my husband bought our home and I absolutely was the same way I had everything in the apartment packed before closing and I was just overly excited about it was build in the 1900 and has add ons now that its started to get warm I can start remodeling and painting! We were both 21 at the time and I have never been more proud of myself and my husband for making thinks possible for our daughter.
This video was so adorable and endearing! I am really happy for you! :)
Watching this video is making me so damn happy and giddy! Ive been watching your vids for a long time and its  feels so good to see you come so far! Congratulations!!    Also, the whole creepy men situation reminded me of something that happened recently with a tiktoker where a guy literally broke into her house while she was filming a video. Like wtf ppl
God damn it that semicolon joke...GOD DAMN IT!!!
it's the ' *let me have my fear* ' for me. ✨🧚
Every conpany should be fighting to get your sponsorship spot, with the amount of effort and fun you put into them!
I’m soo happy for you! Your house is gorgeous! I love your Chanel soo much and I just find u hilarious! You always make my day. U deserve every piece of happiness in your life. Can’t wait to see u take over the world!

YAY YAY YAY
she has evolved
hi i love u
The ads are as good as the content!  💕💕  So happy for you 💕
You saying "I have a house" in that soft voice at the end made me cry such happy tears. Your videos really gave me the courage to try my hand at sewing and I'm still doing it. You have given us endless amounts of laughter with your content. You deserve all of this success, Micarah. ❤️
congratulations!
I'm so happy for you and your house
You deserve this and more.... congrats
does anyone else just want a whole video for garrion the bird?
That eyelash commercial was top notch.  They should be just buying you a house with all this creativity!
i think the whole 'you should live with your parents until you're fully capable of leaving' is very good advice.
But those brown shoes you're wearing with the red turtleneck are adorable😍
I just want to say that u are, Micarah, is an absolutely gorgeous and beautiful person, u are fearless, that’s incredibly inspiring
It would be awesome if you call Mr kate to interior design your new home
Ahhh I'm so happy for you! I can't wait for new videos💕
I'm so happy for u!
I'm so proud of you 😘
I’m NOT too creepy!!!   😜
Congratulations 😊
awwwwwwwwwwwwww u deserve it!
She bought a house without a wheels?!?!? My world Will never be the same 😬😬😮😯😲
I dont even wear makeup and I'm really wanting to get some
Damnn CONGRATULATION!!! You have a house
It has been such a privilege to go on this journey with you and to experience YOU BUYING YOUR HOUSE!!! WHOOOP 👏
Congratulations, you deserve this! Don't feel obliged to explain to your viewers why you bought yourself a house - you simply worked up the money to buy your own property. We will only miss the quirky daily interactions with your precious dad
ok we gotta beat up whoever is stalking her
I was so excited/happy for you over the RV!!  Now YOU GOTTA HOUSE!!! A REALLY GOOD HOUSE!!!  Btw!! You absolutely deserve this! You are so talented and quirky and awesome! Can't wait to see all the things you do to the house! With your imagination the possibilities are insane to think about. I mean that in the best way!❤❤❤🌞🏠🏡
I am so happy for you!
I am genuinely thrilled for you. I know you will love your new home! Congratulations!
I. DONT. BELIEVE. IN. SIDEWALKS!? i spat coffee EVERYWHERE XD XD XD XD
You can see how happy she is 😭 You deserve it
I'm planning to buy a house and I really hope I am just a tenth of how happy you are :)
Im so happy for you
Omgg congrats Micarah
tbh, it makes perfect sense not to want to be in debt. the whole thing about being in constant debt is nuts. i'm so happy for you!
Of every YouTuber, you def deserve and are humble enough to buy a house without feeling guilty or anything. Congrats!
I am so happy for you 😭😭😭
CONGRATSSSS! Love the house!!
glamnetic better have paid for the whole house considering the top tier quality of that advertisement
I'm so happy for you ❤❤❤
You deserve this baby girl so proud of uuu!!!!
Congratulations 🎉  We are proud of you!!!!!!
LOOOL I HATE YOU MICARAHHHHHHHHHHH HAPPY NEW HOUSE!
I’m so happy for you and you DO DESERVE THIS!!! Enjoy it! ❤️❤️
When she says "Oh... even better..." with that face, i felt that lol
Her happiness is so honest and big I lived this moment with her. I am so happy for her.
I know nothing about makeup but dAYUM those strong magnetic lashes are seriously sooo cool **^w(◉ ▽ ◉)w***
wait that house is so pretty
Can I just say, that u DESERVE that house
Congratulations micarah.....you surely deserve it❤
Congratulations!!! Your house looks lovely ☺️
who else just LIVES for these videos?
You make me wanna buy a bird 😁😁😁
I feel a lot better about my fear of debt after this video. My family lost quite literally everything after the 2008 recession and as a result I've decided not to go to college or move out too. I didn't know someone who inspires me so much was having the same fears as me. It gives me a lot of hope to see Miss Micarah thrive and be able to show her creativity. I hope I'll be like her soon, too.
Omg! You are the Ad-Queen of YouTube 💞
Your energy is so vibrant, I could feel your excitement! I'm so happy for you!
Are you gonna give your house a name?
I HAVE TO SLOW DOWN THE SPEED OF YOUR VIDEOS TO UNDERSTAND YOU
I love this for you! This made me so happy
I love Micarah Tewers! I hope you are well-compensated for all these great commercials you are doing.
Your house is lovely, I hope you are very happy there
this also happened to bestdressed :(( whyy
I am so happy for you😍 can't wait for the make over videos
So happy for u ive been watching ur channel for so long now. U deserve everything good that comes ur way
So happy for you Micarah! ☺️ The house IS really pretty
That house is /beautiful/! Now I kinda want a house but I'm a student and a broke artist 😅
14.00 SPOT ON - that’s some serious new house vibes making the dream work - or vice versa.....?! Ok. I’ve confused myself now. 🤷🏼‍♀️
I JUST LOVE YOU and i'm sohappy for you ♥ NOW, i wanna see you redecorate it :)
Wow, that's great! I'm happy for you!! 😊
CONGRATULATIONS MICARAH !!!
Making Harry Potter sleep in a cupboard, savage 😂
Ok I'm so excited to see how you decorate your house! It would be amazing if you can share us the final result
You deserve your house.
OH MY GOD im so happy for you!!!! I've been watching your videos for years and its been so cool to see your platform grow!! :D you are one of my idols and i hope to be like you ❤️
Congratulations ☺️

"I dont believe in sidewalks" caught me so off guard I literally choked😂😂😂
Congrats on you new house Micarah. ❤️❤️❤️
*I don't believe in side walks"😭😭😭😂😂😂😂 please the amount of planning it must take to make your videos so _everything_ ties in❤️
Awww you're so adorable Micarah~
micarah's first few minutes really was the way i think
i was about to comment on your last video just buy a house
sometimes I watch videos in x2 but Micarah sound likes she's already in x2 speed
omg
Am I the only one who was thinking "well she probably broke into an empty house" when seeing the last video and was completely fine with that!?
Congrats its adorable
"I know I don't deserve this" of course you deserve thiiiiis so happy for you
Congrats, Micarah! You deserve it! Thanks for being a much better role model than most popular Youtubers.

This is so wholesome !! Congrats on the new home Micarah!
You ABSOLUTELY DESERVE THIS QUEEN!!
Congratulations 🎉 much Wuv micarah ❤️❤️
I Hope my mom will soon find the perfect home because we are currently living in a small house with 3 rooms and my mom me and 4 of my siblings live here and we have been looking for the perfect house for quite a bit though she is still doing very well taking care of me and my sisters and working usually home at 5 or 6 pm and she is 51 and a single mother she is amazing and I love her I hope when she’s really old I’ll be the one taking care of her
Awwww girl this made me so happy! It reminded me of how giddy I was when I bought my flat and I just know the feeling! Congrats!
I’m crying at the hand saying “wow” 😂😭
I am so sorry that you have to hide where you live for safety reasons. People really are awful. I hope you are safe now 🙏💕💕
This is so cool!! Yay! ✨
You give me life and hope :) You are the proof that uncondicioned people can turn out so amazingly talented and wonderful  ♥️ Congrats on the house!  And don't let the creeps ruin anything!
"I know I don't deserve this" exCUSE ME?!?!!!! yeah no yeah you definitely deserve a nice home, you put out so much creative fun content, we literally see how much work goes into your sewing, let's not even talk about the work of editing videos, you deserve this house. Don't let anyone convince you otherwise!
Here in Asia, living with your parents is normal. So, realizing that in Americans, could like make fun of people for staying with your parents is weird.
Congrats!!!! The house looks like my dream home too. Maybe one day I'll get an old victorian home. 🤗 And that couch too. 😋
i bought the dang lashes
I am so happy for you!!
omg, i love this I love you and you deserve it dubo<3 muah sis
CON-FRICKIN-GRATS Micarah!!!!! 🤩  I just got a 1.5-bedroom appartement (I rent of course) and I am equally excited 🤪
I'm hoping the house in the thumbnail isn't the actual outside of her house. It really stands out and I'd hate for her to have more problems.
:’) you deserve it
I feel like the house tour was the exact exciting chaos that was gonig on in her head ahahahaa
It’s amazing to watch you. There are some people that have a natural, special shine to them and you’re absolutely one of these people. You deserve the world 💙🌈💙🌈💙
I actually watched the whole ad lol
that moment when you habitually skip people's sponsored content but micarah is just too funny. Also, damn but 1910 is a NEW house, not an old house. Also PREACH living with your parents until you can afford to leave!!!
So happy for you Micarah!!!
I am genuienly so happy for this girl! Such a treat of a content! Even her ads are brilliant!
My dad also offers me eggs all the time. Curious
Congratulations on the house Micarah! (P.s. you *do* deserve it, be happy 😊)
Your happiness makes my happy. I love that you are super ok with living with your parent til you are ready. I am in the same situation. Extremely happy for you.
BUT will we see Zelda and the other chickens visit? 🐤
you deserve it 👏 💓
Something about this video is so cozy
bro why am I crying tho
Wait wait WAIt. You mean you’ve NEVER been in 2 bathrooms at once??
Your happiness is so contagious. You deserve this wonderful home for all the fun and happiness you bring us! ❤️
I've never used eyeliner or false lashes, but u just sell it so well O-O
I hate thinking that she is being stalked because that is just absolutely nightmarish. Knowing that there are people who lack basic respect for other's privacy makes me unsettled. I know she didn't want to show us the outside of the house because of safety reasons but I still hope she also has some type of security cameras and alarms installed, maybe some type of covering for the RVs, since two RVs will stand out. Instead of a dog, maybe an attack goose? Just anything to make this less stressful for her, because she definitely deserves this house and peace of mind.
would love to see you do some edward scissorhand-style shrubbery scultping for ur house.
It made me so happy to see how genuinely excited you are. You deserve this girl. Love you.
Am i the only one who heard  that she is one and a half person maybe?? Hahahahaha damn preggy girl WORK IT hahaha
Congratulations! You deserve it!
“This is where Harry Potter will sleep when he comes to visit” 🤣
When you came sliding on your floor in the white I immediately thought of what a man gotta do
Anyone know the breed of bird?
I’m not gonna lie, I genuinely thought you had broken into a house in that video
I've been watching you for so long (not in a creepy way) and I am so happy you got your own place! It's honestly so cute from what you've shown, bask in the new-house serotonin! <3
So happy for you Micarah 🥳
So happy for you 😍😍🥳
No one else going to mention how she made this video exactly 14 minutes long too...
At first I was like, wow she must be incredibly rich now, buying a nice house and all but the I remembered - this is the US and if you live in this kind of area you can get a gorgeous house for normal people money oml my country has such small expensive houses 😭
Micarah is the only person that actually makes paid promotions entertaining
its so cute how one of the reasons you moved is cause of gareon
micrah im so happy for you
Aww! I’m so happy for you, Micarah!
I feel like she still wasn’t careful enough with not showing the house and surroundings and stuff. I hope she doesn’t get stalkers :(
So excited for you!!!  And, stop thinking you don’t deserve it!  You do!  You are a wonderful supply of sweet entertainment for many!!!  Who cares if you didn’t go to college!  People go to college so that they can better support themselves and you already do that!  One might say, you’re an over achiever!  (It’s me, I’m one.)  Enjoy your new digs!
You SO do deserve this.you are so creative and entertaining and unique and interesting. Don’t sell yourself yourself short. Congratulations and so well deserved!
I'm so happy for you🤍
You do deserve it though. Also I laughed out at "I don't know which ones of you are the creepy ones"
“ I don’t know which of you are the creepy ones” 😂😂
I feel so bad for Micarah. I hope her dad is safe!
am I the only person who thinks that her teeth looks like vampair teeth
fly free . your videos are always the best
Omg your house is so pretty! I like the old timey look it's gorgeous 😍
So happy for u! Congrats!!🎉 (now get security cams)
She is the blue print for the Gen Z Bimbo... just saying... a QUEEN
CONGRAST QUEEN
I knew it was your (homeowner) house! I'm so happy for you (homeowner)!! Are you (homeowner) still gonna keep the RVs? The house (yours) is so gorgeous! Can't wait to watch how you (homeowner) decorate and renovate the place (your house omg yaay)!!
she really is doing that 14 minute thin huh!!!
Awww! <3 Sweet girl! How amazing! I'm so happy for you. How exciting. I can't wait to see you fix it up to be exactly yours and all the shenanigans you'll get up to there. Congratulations!
Happy for you!! :) you deserve it!!
I'm so happy for you😭😭💞💞
Yay
This made me feel so happy like it was me who bought the house 😄. Congratulations sis happy for you
You posted this on my Mum's Birthday 🐸
So happy for you
I totally get the random joy/crying. I've lived in my own apartment for 3 years and I've finally had time to renovate it. It's been stressful but it's 3/4 done and looks awesome.  A large portion was done while we had social distancing and 3 full quarantines. My parents don't go anywhere other than for groceries and hardware curbside pickup so we bubbled together.  Also Kijiji and yard sales are definitely helpful (depending on your COVID levels though). We had literally 10 people sick when my mom found an oval Victorian mirror for me. 💜 (My house is 200 years old and my bathroom is Victorian and French country).
Happy for you
You are so precious and deserve your own house. ❤️ I'm so excited about lots and lots of new content!
I just wanted to tell you that I came across your channel recently and I bought my first sewing machine shortly after~ aaaand I love it! I never considered sewing (like ever ever) because I thought there were lots of rules and stuff and since I'm an American the only rule I'm subject to is not keeping my own wisdom teeth. I've been wearing my new creations all week. I didn't know sewing was the creative outlet I so desperately needed. Anyway, maybe you'll see this, maybe you won't, but I just wanted to say thank thank thank you. Also, you said whether we like it or not you pray for your subscribers and I just wanted to say jokes on you, because I'm praying for you too! Supernatural creativity and wisdom in abundance! Congratulations on your new house!!!💗
I'm sooo happy for you😭😭😭❤
Oh my god my mum always offers me eggs!! It truly does wear on a person
Literally watching this as I wait and wait for a real estate agent to call me back and tell me if I got my new home. It's a tiny one bedroom unit though, so either money buys a lot more over there, or you're killing it on YouTube.  Either way, congratulations, and keep your fingers crossed for me!  Ps. Sorry to hear people stalked your dads house, that's so fucked.
Congrats!!
YAYYY
AAHH IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU!!💜💜💜
AAA CONGRATS OMG I REMEMBER SUBBING TO U WHEN U HAD 200K OR SO IM SO PROUD AAAAAAA ILY
Here's me leaving the country at 19 and haven't been home in 15 years...
Kryptonite free?🤦🏻‍♀️
I would like it on the record that my fear of clowns is not irrational. When I was about 6 years old there was a clown at a friend's birthday party and they decided to do a trick which involved juggling fire over someone. That someone was my mother, who they spray with what they told me was accelerant to "make her go up faster" if they dropped a flaming club. My trauma is real.
youre literally the purest youtuber
You DO deserve this. You have earned it. Know your worthiness.  God would want you to know that you are worthy of abundance and good things that bring you joy.
Omg you guys call over-easy eggs "dippin' eggs" and my family calls them "dippy eggs" because my sister forgot the name one time and that's how she told my Dad she wanted her eggs cooked. Now I can tell her she's not alone!
I love watching your videos cos you have the vibe of an older sister and its really comforting ❤
WELL DONE GIRL!!!
Just because it's a privilege doesn't mean you don't deserve it!! You work hard, and you earned it! I am so happy for you! (and also a bit worried that guys have been harassing you, so stay safe!)
Congratulations well deservedddddd
"ive literally actually never gone to two bathrooms at the same time and i dont think i ever will" lmao
6:30 I agree with and appreciate this statement so much!! I'm 18 and I still live at home, don't see myself moving out anytime soon, because... I'm totally not ready or capable of living on my own yet! It's so annoying that a lot of people still think this type of thing is weird.
I am so happy for you and I am incredibly glad that you can express your creativity as a job instead of retail for life!!!  It is not cool for anyone to creep on you please be safe, carry a taser.
SOOOO HAPPY FOR YOU!
OMG CONGRATS!!! You definitely deserves it, and I'm so happy for you 💛
I;\'m so happy for you. I found you in early 2020 and fell in love with your unapologetic personality.
My congratulations!
AANND the best video on the internet, i am simply happy, imma go conquer the world now
Oh so precious. Congratulations love. Of course you deserve this. Age is just a number.
I love this, and am so happy for you! On a side note, if the thumbnail is in front of your new house, you may want to change it so it’s not findable 💕 i drink cake!
CHECK YOUR VIDEO...sweet, charming, delightful , NAIVE Micarah ( it's ok it's part of your ADHD)  I could get to your house... Take a hard look at your video...PLEASE
OHH  MISS GURLL, CONGRATULATIONS!!! I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU :))❤️❤️❤️❤️
omg this was so wholesome thank you for making my day start a little better
You deserve it
I'm glad you got your house without having a mortgage.
What part of Ohio are you from? I'm from Youngstown!
Do you have a patreon group?
I accidentally disliked for 0.2 seconds (bc I misclicked trying to hit the thumbs up) and I feel so bad!! Love you and happy for you!!
YOU GOT A HOUSE!! So happy for you Micarah <3
Oh my goodness, so excited for you! Congratulations!!
any stance she takes looks like vouge's coverpage.
I don't do makeup but that brand is cool af magnetic lashes
the last video was 14:01, and this on ewas 13:59. You were so close. SO CLOSE
this made my day <3
you just watched a 3 minute in-between advertisement and did not skip even once
Oh my gosh I'm so hAPPY FOR YOU! OH MY GOSH!! I can totally empathize with the joys you are feeling right now! I currently live with my parents and they are of the mindset (and have the room) that I should stay with them until I'm financially stable enough to afford my own place. I am still at the point where I'm imagining "Oh gonna have to marry a rich dude, or maybe I should just trick out a van and live there... but I love baths too much so I probably won't be happy for long."  I long for the day when I can buy property, security, someplace to call my own, whether it be a lovely cottage in the forest, a modest suburban home, a lovely little Tudor, or heavy help me a Queen Anne house with a turret!! I am so SO  S O  Happy for you girl! You deserve this! Your creativity and talent you share with your videos is worth it!
You being all giddy in your house made me so happy! Congrats on your new house, this was so fun to watch :)
Congratulations! My husband and I got our own house last year)) and I understand your excitement! It’s nice to live with a loving family, but as a creative person you need a lot of space) so good luck in the new home!
Don't be ashamed of a privilege, you deserved it
Congrats on the new house, hope you make happy memories in it.♥️
Oh my gosh, I am genuinely happy seeing her this happy XD
Congratulations!
So happy for you! It's so cool!
ughh this is such a cute video
Oh, so I was the only one genuinely comfortable with the idea that she broke into an empty house to film the last few seconds of her last video? Ok ig...
I can't believe I'm watching your Glamnetic Lash ad. It's actually entertaining that I don't feel like skipping.
I, too, have a Zillow addiction, gives me hope that I could someday afford a house
Congrats Micarah on the home so exciting! BTW you're my spirit animal if I ever had one.
I've been following you for so long and I love how you've grown and your content always makes me smile + the talent you have - GIRLLLL 👏💖 CONGRATULATIONS 🎉🎉🎉
You deserve it! I’m so happy for you!
Okay you got me. That was a good commercial
nice house!
CONGRATS!!!! YOU DESERVE IT ALL!!!
your joy is infectious. congrats on the house !! so happy for you
QUEEEENNNNN ABSOLUTELY!!! CONGRATULATIONS ICON I AM SO HAPPY FOR YOU THIS IS SUCH A BIG THING
ok
I'm soo Happy for You Sweetheart  🕊💕 🙋‍♀️🏻
Congratulations!  I’m so sorry to hear about creepers creeping around. I’m glad you have your very own house in an undisclosed location. Maybe invest in some motion lights and security cameras for a little extra peace of mind.
Congrats Micarah, it's gorgeous!  13:23  ☺️🌷🌷🌷
Congratulations ❤❤❤❤
this made me SO insanely happy. so proud of you and you definitely deserve this !!
And exactly 14 minutes again!! 💕💕💕
Your outfit is giving me a Micarah-fied version of “Chilling Adventures of Sabrina” and I’m here for it 🥰
PLEASE install security cameras around your house, both outside and inside, especially if you're living alone. My home is also riddled with CCTVs and one time a stray cat came in and ate my sandwich. Beware of stray cats lmao
I just admire Micarah's uniqueness. I too have a fear of normalcy and I've been wondering who I wanna be and at last, I wanna be the weirdly and peculiarly her
“This has been A JOKE” sent meeee
Excuse me!! YOU DESERVE THIS MAAM
i watched the whole ad forgetting what video i clicked on originally
so, so happy for you micarah. you absolutely 100% deserve this ♥️
I told my friend once I'd never buy a house if it meant taking out a loan and she thought I was weird now I feel justified
I was just wondering at school if you posted a video yet lol
This video is also 14 minutes long. MICARAH, WHAT'S HAPPENING?
See I thought you snuck into a vacant house to take photos
this is the first time  ive been genuinely interested in a sponsored product
Congarts guuuurrrrlll keep slaying💚💚💚
Congratulations on your new home 😍 seeing you so happy is great and that titanic scene 😂
The people at Glamnetic: Man this girl is weird but she can sure sell our cyanide free lashes.
this is my favorite advertisement for anything ever. thanks, Micarah.
when Micarah said about the fear of clowns I was like, how did she know!
I'm so happy for you! :D
Your house looks cool
THE SMILE ON UR FACE IM S GAPPY FOR UUU
I was squealing with excitement right along with you,  This made me so happy!
your house is really pretty, im so happy for u micarah!!

This video being exactly 14:00 minutes satisfys me just as much as this actual video
YOU TOTALLY DESERVE IT WDYM 😑
🌈🌈🦋🦋
So happy for you!! 🌠
i want micarah to make every youtube ad, if she did I'd never skip it
Okay but I actually cried bc I felt so happy for you
Dave Ramsey would be so proud 🤣 You’re an inspiration to us budget-conscious former homeschoolers everywhere!!! 👏🏻Congratulations, you’ve earned it! 🎉🎉🎉
so happy for you 🥺
This was so cute !!!!!! So happy for u. You definitely deserve it
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS this is very exciting, love our new home
Congratulations ❤️❤️❤️❤️
What about the van?
Is it just me but I hate big houses I rather have a small cute house (if it was pink that would be even better 😂)
congratulations 😍🎉
Im so proud of u aahh and u deserve every freking inch of that mansion...and u are jst omg everything...u deserve it ......u are a gem hun
the way micarah actually made me want to buy those lashes
SHOW US A TOUR OR TRY MAKING PANCAKE ART BUT TRY TO DO DREES ART
The only channel where I watch sponsors and never skip them. 🤭
Well done!
Yas micarah qween U-U i need micarah and i luv u
“i’m very particular about which laws i break” ok same- i mean what
I also moved into my new house recently I can feel you 😘❤️💕☺️😍🥰✌️🤗
Me trying not to be poor and envious.. I succeeded you’re cool and it’s dope you got a house!
YOU DO DESERVE THIS! Congrats!!
SHE TOTALLY EARNED IT
you forgot the part where you are in escrow
Omg congrats! I'm so jealous! I do wanna see some remodel videos ❤️
"I know I don't deserve this. I know this is a privilege most people my age don't have." You're absolutely wrong. You totally deserve this. You've existed in this world as your absurd self and not given in to society's pressure to be a certain way. You've entertained millions of people without harassing people or making racist jokes like the majority of bigger Youtubers. While it's true that most people our age can't even dream of owning a house, it honestly shouldn't be a privilege to be a homeowner. I'm very proud of how far you've come and wish you all the happiness in the world. I can't wait to see what you do to your house!
OMG I AM SO HAPPY FOR YOU
IM SHOOK SHE BOUGHT A HOUSE
Happy for you!( just please keep the RV pls)
I love that you casually roller skated through your house, it was fantastic
How excited she is, I was this excited about getting a wide brimmed fedora hat 😂
Congratulations, you're adorable!
7:12 same... mortgage is big.
So glad you’re able to purchase your own home at a young age. Congrats! Hopefully you can get a security system set up soon so that you are as safe as possible from any unwanted creeps, I’m so sorry you had some unfortunate happenings at your dad’s place. Again, congrats and can’t wait to see what you do with the place!! 😍
I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU CONGRATULATIONS
Congratulations Micarah. Enjoy it.
I'm  a long time subscriber omay
you SO deserve this! we're so so happy for you Micarah!!!
Ok but this is literally my dream house *opens zillow*
Micarah you deserve that house ❤️
omg
I hope you’re investing in a security system For those stalkers 🥺
So happy for you!!!
You more than deserve it, you bring so much joy into the world! This video is so inspiring! Congrats, Micarah!
She's so sweet 🥺 I love how happy this makes her
Bless her
you deserve only beautiful things! i'm so so happy for you! you give hope to people our age to getting to our dreams and having a house of our own too!! you gotta make a video on shopping for furniture / assembling furniture / diy-ing furniture tho -- just a suggestion
Why do creeps think that randomly stalking someone will work? Women don't like to be stalked by strange men. This isn't new information.
Wow I love it! ❤️
You've heard of snow angels - try wood floor angels (I did carpet angels) - best angels
YOU DID A WHAT?!  That was my honest reaction.
Ok so I was at the supermarket and checked my notification (as always looking for a new video from you ) and when I read the title I started smiling. I can’t explain how happy I am for you! You deserve it so much, I pray for you to be the happiest in your life!! God bless you!!!
im so happy for you!!
Hearing you support living with your parents until you are fully capable of moving out is so reassuring.
_I want a tea party🥺😍_
Congrats on buying your first house!!
WE. LOVE. YOU. You. DESERVE. This. Thank you for bringing us joy
Congratulations!! I'm so happy for you and I can't wait for future vids in your new place! 😭💖
I am so happy for you, Micarah!!
I never enjoyed watching ads before this lol😂😂
Congratulations!! And I agree if you have the opportunity to stay with your parents and it’s a safe environment for you to grow, Do It!
Congratukation girl
CONGRATS GIRLLLL IM GONNA MISS THE RV
'i don't believe in sidewalks' said the true jay walking queen
I've been your subscriber for a long time (tho I'm not frequently commenting bc I'm lazy lol) but I wanna say I am very very happy for you!! congratulations to your new house, you deserve it because you work hard for it. thank you for showing this and inspiring us❣️❣️❣️
Congratulations! I just bought my first house too & i understand how you feel!
Good for you. It’s great seeing someone of my generation actually achieving something worth-while. Congrats.
ngl when she was in a the vacant house in the last video I actually thought that she broke into a house.
She’s so cute I love her
I just feel extremely happy for people getting their own houses it's such a big step in life. Also just a dream for many so congrats!!
You deserve it, congrats :)❤️
When I saw this video wasn’t at least 20 min long I got sad.
Oh my gooood I'm soooooo happy for you Micarah💞💞💞
Congratulations girl!!!! So well deserved. Thank you for being you
Ok so all your videos are wholesome, but this one was extra wholesome omg congratulations!!!
I’m so happy for you 🤍🤍
I am SOOO happy for you honestly. I was smiling the whole way through
Congratulations!!! 🙂
IF YOU WERE ONE OF THE CREEPS WHO STALKED HER I WILL BE HAUNTING YOU AFTER I DIE JUST FYI
I have fear of both mortgage and clowns... let me have my own fears in peace Micarah😭
You make me scream with gleee!! Congrats Micarah, you deserve it!'
congratulations!!!!!!
“I’m going to have to let go jack...but the lashes never will.”~ Micarah’s hand
I’m so looking forward for renovations videos on your new house!! 😆😆
Honestly debt is not an irrational fear. It's very reasonable. Unfortunately, the way our society is, most people can't avoid getting in debt. Doesn't make it a good thing.
You’re really pretty! When you put yourself in front of the blocks of sunlight I went 😯💗
The Serotonin I just got from this video is throw the roof
Congratulations Micarahhh <3
Micarah do you want some eggs?
this the complete depiction of what absolute joy is !!! couldn’t stop smiling this whole video — so happy for you ! ☺️✨🤍
very sorry to hear people were being incredibly weird about where you live, but am so happy that you got to find a dream house! can't wait to see the amount the renovation you do
So we're gonna have a dedicated series of you DIY-ing your entire house, right?
Congrats Micarah! Also, your outfit from when you were running around your house with your dad is V cute
So proud of you
omg congrats!!!
seeing you be so excited about your new home made me so happy for you!!!!💜
Congratulations!!!! That's a beautiful house!!!!
YO CREEPS! IMMA FIND YOU! Mess with my girl again and your straight up dead. I dont make threats, но мой папа казнит их.    Anyway so happy for you! It looks perfect for you!  You definitely worked hard and you deserve it! 🤩🤩🥳🥳🥳
I hate how literally every female youtuber I watch has to eventually move because some psycho dude finds out where they live and start harassing them. This is way to common. It’s gross, ridiculous and unfair.
The fact that the The letters for TEWERS are right next to each other is what really sold it for me.
"It's also lead-free, cyanide-free, and kryptonite-free!" Your silence about arsenic is deafening
Omgg please do a house decoration video i am so excited congratulations❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
No. Freaking. Way
Yay!!!!!!
This is the cutest thing ever. Especially the ending! I’m soooo proud of you!!! 😭😭😭
Super happy for you micarah!! thanks for blessing us w your vids
I am so happy for you Micarah! Thank you for actually making your sponsor breaks entertaining so I don't have to skip them!!
Very Happy for you!! Im glad your content which makes me super happy has meant you can get this house!  Well deserved
Congratulations! I'm so happy for you! Staying out of debt is extremely smart, young lady. Also, if all you did was make a video with punctuation jokes, I would definitely like it.
I'd love to come to the housewarming, but I live in France and I can't fly over there....
You DESERVE a house! Don’t ever say you don’t! You work hard and make money and are an adult who can spend it how you like. I’m so proud of you and happy for you and I can’t wait to see how you make it your own! ❤️💕
OMG CONGRATS! LOVE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!
Love you vids and when I saw you bought a house my heart filled with joy because I know it is hard right now my mom is trying to find a home for meher and my brother to live in love you and thank you for making me smile  I know you won't see this so it was a waste of my time but much love
WHAT? OFC YOU DESERVE IT!  SO HAPPY FOR YOU. ❤❤❤
We did it.... *The video is exactly 14 minutes.*
congrats on the new house!!!! Buying my own own is also a goal of mine for the future so i'm really glad for you that you bought one for yourself!!
When she said she wasn't gonna show the front of her house but did it anyway jfkgslfjgskl
I'm so sorry you had to go through the creepy unsettling unsafe feeling of having someone creep on your dad's house ): that must have been awful
Congrats sis!!!
You deserve my queen!!!
This is so cute,  I'm so happy for you!
Congratulations!! Good for you! ♥️
How does your bird just free roam? It's doesn't poop everywhere?
THE VID IS 13:59 SECONDS LONG IM SO ANNOYED RN

PEOPLE STAY AWAY FROM MR. TEWER AND HIS HOUSE AND DON'T YOU DARE TO GET NEAR MICARAH'S HOUSE OR ANY OF HER RVS!!
You looks so happy hope your new house treats you well
I’m so proud of you, Micarah. I remember when I first subscribed to your channel & I’m glad I did that!
I'm so happy for you!!!! You absolutely deserve this!!!!!! This was a win for the people!!!!!
So so so happy to see you thriving
Congrats 🎉🎉🎉🎉 i am so happy for you   .stay safe💛
You've come so far. I'm sooo proud and happy to be one of your viewers from day one. 🥺 Well deserved!
I don't believe in sidewalks either...but people are jerks if you walk on the shoulder of the road so better keep.my distance
I didnt even piece it together...I was just like oh she probably did break into a vacant house
✨
I kept reading the title "I bought a horse" and I didn't think to read twice, because at this point I wasn't't even surprised she bought a horse. 😂
OoooOOooooOOOoo
Yaaaay so happy for you!! ❤❤❤
All I have to say is this time, don’t go sketching a dress on your fridge. Unless you really want to 😝
Seeing several icons interacting on this video makes me so happy 😩😩    I’m so sorry that there are stalkers
You're one of those show characters I watch one episode of and I do everything in my power to copy your personality
Micarah I am very proud and happy for you <3 I've been watching you since late 2018 and I'm so happy to have watched you grow and make content the last few years. You've inspired me so much in the things that you create and your fun attitude! Congrats on the house!! Yay!!!
Congratulations!!! You deserve this!!
Congratulations . You go girl.
CONGRATULATIONS 🍾🎈 🎊  I bought my first house In November of 2019💜 I hope I learn to be as creative as you are. Sending all the love
Congratulations, girl! We’re all so happy for you! Glad we could be part of the journey. :)
I love it!!! It has so much character!!!
so victorian on the outside and edwardian on the inside?
I love it 🥺
She needs to start an acting career
I saw this and nearly screamed. Then I remembered I was in public
It's like a magnified caravan, with a higher ceiling, bigger space and rooms. Especially with that one bathroom, it's like saying passively it's a house for one and only person, it's owner 😍.
This was perfect
IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU. You totally deserve this and that's a lovely home.
I’m sooooo happy for you Micarah, I truly wish you the best. God bless you❤️
How awesome! I’m so happy for you!
10:55 that- that looks like the entrance to the house i saw in my dreams- i... i saw that house in my dreams... is there a swimming pool?
I’m 34 and we are in the process of building a house it will be the first home I have ever owned. I’m probably going to bawl at the signing when it’s all done.
FUCK IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU
Omg I love the chaotic joy coming though this video!! I might need u to direct every home tour ever 😂
so true about not leaving your parents house until you have the means to do, never understood why people (with good parents ofc, i understand needing to leave a toxic home) feel the need to move out as soon as they're 18,, iN tHis EcOnOmY??? also so gross about the creeps :///
So like congrats on the house... and darn those shoes are freaking cute!
So happy to see you move into your dream house, you totally deserve it!! 🥰❤️ so wholesome
I mean...you do deserve this
Stay winning!
Yay! More space to work and for your costumes😂😄
“No, but they might” 😂
Girl, you deserve the world 🥺 you are such a bright and energetic sweet soul, you've brought me and so many others so much happiness in this crazy sad world.   We're all so excited for you 🙌 and we can't wait to see what comes next!!
I'm.so happy for You girl!!!!!!
OMG I'm so happy for you and also a tad bit jelly! I want a house of my own too soonest!
Why are your goodwills  better than mine? 😭
t h a t s i l l e g a l
Why did I read it as “I bought a horse!”
I'm so glad you know what dippin' eggs are!! No one I know understands until I forcefully thrust it upon them.
CONGRATULATIONS!!
This is the first time I've seen a house tour where someone legitimately seems so happy and blessed to have it. I love your videos because you just seem so genuine.   But also you're very goofy and I enjoy that.
Just love the vibe
cant wait to see what you and your Pop turn your house into. makes me happy to see you happy! and girl! your house is gorgeous!!
You deserve this Micarah. I am so happy for you, Congrats on the new house!
So happy for you!🥺🥺🥺✨✨✨

Your excitement is so wholesome, I'm so happy for you Micarah!
SO EXCITED FOR U!!!!!!!!
I watched that whole sponsored part of the video like I needed it.
Micarah you are truly one of a kind and we thank you for sharing even a slight piece of yourself with us! Hehe ;D This was well deserved and I can't wait to see what the future holds for you! Sending you love and positivity!

Congrats!  Looking forward to the makeover vids!
"And this is where Harry will sleep when he comes to visit," Harry watching this: :']
Me, seeing that Micarah bought a house: :D Me realizing that means less screen time for her dad: :(
Congratulations! You deserve a great house!
You 100% deserve this! Congratulations 🎉

Aww, this is so wholesome! X3
Your smile made my day
I don't know why other people's happiness makes me so happy that it makes me cry tears of joy.
Congratulations on having your own house where you can slide on the floor with your white socks. You deserved it!
Dont show your keys, there are programs where they can copy that key, and now, have a copy of your key
Is it me or is the sponser ship part fun to watch
i usually just skip the commercial, but this- this is FUN
Congratulations!!!!
Congratulations!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
“I don’t believe in sidewalks” is my favorite quote from this video
WHAT ABOUT THE RVVVV
I got an ad for a RV dealership before this video...... Come on YouTube you had one job!! This is one of the videos where she *doesn't* buy an RV!
IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU ITS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL HOUSE EVER!!!!
Girl congrats! 😂 I wish I could do that!
CONGRATULATIONS!!
Awe congratulations! Your authentic self made us want to support you, so really than yourself for being so awesome!
Congrats! It looks amazing 🤩
THE LETTERS ARE NEXT TO EACH OTHER 😂😂😂. as most of the letters on the keyboard

I was having so much fun until the 5 min mark. 🥺 Can anyone else she how terrible what shes saying is? I dont think its just a comedy bit. Is someone stalking you?? What the heck is wrong with people?
i'm so happy for u <3
loved it, im so happy for her!!
13:59 minutes of pure wholesomeness, my cheeks are hurting from smiling
girl are you too tall or are the doors too short???!!!!
May i please buy your RV?
💕💜💕
LOVE THIS! you deserve it
Creepy dudes suck but I’m also so happy that something good came out of it! Stay safe, happy, and healthy!!
You might think you don't deserve it but your videos make people genuinely happy so if having a house makes you genuinely happy then that seems pretty fair.
Yayyyyy bring on the renovating and decorating content 🥰
Didn’t she show the front of the house in the thumbnail...
I am a lot older than you and don't think I'll ever be able to afford one, so it makes me insanely happy to watch someone who works so hard get to enjoy purchasing their very own space. Yay for house decorating videos! (They are like clothes making videos but the clothes you are making are for the house)
im sooo excited to see how she decorates her place!!!!
Big hugs, congrats!!
She has a cheatcode for Millennialism. She owns a house now. This woman has been my idol for a long time but now she's the ultimate
"Please don't give me a virus *this time* "  Honestly me
Yay!! Congrats!! (Screw the scary weirdos, I’m sorry 😭) so glad you found a house, you deserve it!
Congratulations!!!
I’m so happy for you!!
Hello, it is currently 3:55 am and I have just awoken from an unpleasant dream. Cinderella says if you tell someone your dream it won't come true so here we go: I dreampt I was on my computer and a tab showed up so i clicked on it, it was for a real estate agent and the house was labeled Micarah Tewers house then just below that it read 'it's not actually her house but a similar one I found'. So I was looking through the pictures, the house was super pretty then there was a video of the person who uploaded the photos who in fact had just moved into the house, or maybe they were squatting (it became hard to tell). I don't remember exactly what happened in the video but it was a little odd and at some point the eyes of the paintings in the house were a shaded blackish colour and the person in the video started to notice that they weren't the only person squatting there. At that point I noped out of watching the video (verry rightly) and I watched amylee33 instead (idk why but it was like bubblegum in my brain in comparison). At some point however I wasn't watching amylee33 anymore and I was inside the house (this didn't faze me because these things don't when your in a dream). However this now meant I was in the house with that other thing, it began to appear in the shadows and tormented me (it looked like that clown from 'it' which is a movie I haven't seen because I don't like horror). No matter how many times I poked him in the eyes to get him to go away cuz his eyes are terrifying HE KEPT POPPING UP. I am a verry jumpy person at the best of times, my heart was not ok. Then hope gleamed on me: A family moved into the house. I realise I'm either a squatter or a ghost but either way I can't leave this house. The new arrivals are unfazed by my presence and I try to ask for their help to expel whatever demons territory I have ended up on, however I think he possessed them cuz boy was that scene not pretty. A few more horrifying jump-scares later and I forced myself awake. Your house is really pretty. The real one not the one from my dream. Imma try to sleep now. Goodnight :)  P. S. I'm sorry.
So happy for you!!!
"I don't believe in sidewalks."
Yay🥳 I am happy for you I am also getting a house this Friday
You did way too well at selling me those eyelashes
Awwww I’m so thrilled for you!! I’ve been subscribed for many years and it’s just so exciting to see your channel grow❤️
I didn't even know you bought a house!!! I thought u just went into a random one LOL
PLEASE ALWAYS BRING PEPPER SPRAY WITH YOU..! Q-Q even in the bath and in your sleep
Yay! This made me so happy for you!!
You're so humble and achnowledge your privilege which is another reason why you're my favorite YouTuber. This is definitely deserved! Congrats :)
Spoiler alert: She does show us the front of her house. 11.49
I don’t wear fake lashes or much makeup but damn I want fake lashes now.
Seeing you happy, makes us happy!! Congratulations on your new house bish yaaaas!♡
Congratulations Micarah! And you do deserve this, you make such fun and uplifting content that brings joy to so so so many people! Can't wait for you to fulfill your dreams decorating and living in YOUR home! Sending only good vibes!
By the way, if you don't believe in reincarnation look up "September 11 reincarnated kids" on the internet. There are children who know their previous lives first and last names. There is also the story James Leininger a kid who remembers his life as a World War 2 fighter pilot that was shot down. His story is well known and documented.
What are dippin eggs?
Its so amazing seeing younger people able to afford their homes. Such an inspiration.
This video is so happy, I needed it
IDC I Drink Cake sounds about right
Girl! You deserve everything. Never say you dont deserve something there is no room for that kinda talk in your new house. Congrats on your new home.
I'm certain you have a bright and prosperous future in marketing/advertising 👍🏾
5:45 bummed me out. Micarah should get SimpliSafe to sponsor her if she hasn't yet and secure her new home. 🏠 🔐🗝️ 🚨
Your so pretty
CONGRATS!! This is so well deserved ✨
I'm so happy for you, such a humble girl, you deserve the world 🌎
reason #5 is very commendable
🍾Congratulations!!!!!🎉I think it’s awesome God bless your new house and you.
Can I come over? I'm one of the creepy one's but at least you know up front!
Yo I thought the nails were going to be magnetic too and I was so excited lol. In hindsight that would probably never work.
CONGRATS!!!! I am so excited for you! I have been a long time watcher! I love youuu! So glad you got the house of your dreams! Also you are freakin gorgeous! You aremy fav youtuber and when you dont post i find myself rewatching yourvideos over and over! Keep being you please no matter how much hate you get! (As if people can hate on someone so pretty and hilarious!) Also so sorry about your dads house! Stay Safe! 💗💗💗💗
Watching all the ads because we gotta let you live (and continue to pay for) your dream!!
Congratulations 👏 ❤🙏 God is good!
You are the only youtuber that i don't skip the sponsor part💖
Congratulations babes! You deserve it!
Where are your shoes from I love them!
Congrats on buying your house!! I hope to see some house renovating videos in the near future!!
A fear of loan and debt is nothing but sensible and smart.
This is so wholesome.
Micarah you are a literal ray of sunshine and my day gets 1000X better whenever I see a notification from you Enjoy your new house because you deserve it 1000%! Also stay safe please
I love your house!  You're by far the funniest YT personality out there!  I really enjoy your humor, amazing design talent and great video editing!!  Keep being you- as it inspires us all to show up as who we really are- and that is a wonderful gift to the world!
Micarah basically has 3 house now
What camera do you use?
How much was it
Im supposed to close on my first home at the end of this month ! Would love some home videos to get me inspired to fix stuff up too <3
She can have a security room now
i may not achieve much in my life but knowing im 1/1600000th responsible for helping Micarah Tewers get a house is enough for me
Okay that dad joke left me wheezing.
I'm so happy for you Micarah! And as for the 'deserving a house at your age' thing - you worked hard and you waited your turn, and things lined up for you so you could get that house. Don't bring yourself down by thinking you don't deserve things. 💜 Also your bird must be pumped at all the free space he has to fly around in now. That's awesome too lmao.
4:40 it's the sarcasm with a touch of panic that does it 😂
I'm sorry I didn't watch this earlier, I was rewatching AHS and Kyle Spencer is my comfort character
micarah’s ads are the only ones that i watch without skipping 💀
Congrats! Beautiful home!
Congratulations 🎉❤️🔥😭
I LOVE YOU LOVING THE HOUSE... WE LOVE THE HOUSE.
GREAT JOB GUURLLLLLLLLL
Why you so precious
I thought I was the only person who obsessively scrolled on Zillow so this is very validating
We need more house updates!!!!!
YAAAAY WE’RE SO HAPPY FOR YOUUU
Then tell us how ur feeling🙈🤭😋
Thats so awesome. I'm happy for you
"I know I don't deserve this" bruh you deserve a happy life with a nice home and low debt. You are indeed in the privileged situation of affording a house but you still deserve it. Look how happy you are in this video
When she says i love you house it is the cutest thing EVER
It’s beautiful!!!!!!
You deserve that house, I’m so happy for you!
micarah sis are you like... okay? are you good? im worried for your safety and wellbeing. pls be safe <3
congratulations :)
I love the pure excitment and happiness radiating from her
Congrats! You've made a lot of people laugh and brightened our days. You totally deserve it. This is house is gorgeous and is exactly the kind of house I'd love to have one day! I'm dreaming of being able to paint murals all over my walls lol
You absolutely deserve it! Every video you upload I'm amazed by your wit, creativity and how much work must have gone into the process. Congratulations Micarah! <3
That is so awesome! Congratulations on your new home! 😊
oh no
Congratulations on the house!  Get yourself a baseball bat you leave by the door... steel.  Remember nobody is entitled to your time or kindness, it's hard to learn when being kind is jammed down your throat from birth.  Also home security cameras these days are worth it (sadly sometimes having something to show the cops is helpful).  Lastly don't let the negative extinguish your creativity and amazing personality.  You have a lot to look forward to.
I want glamnetic lashes now but I've always had horrible luck of buying ones that are fearfully long or shorter than my natural lashes. Help?
Congrats on the beautiful stunning victorian house!!!!!!!!!!! i'm so hyped to see you personalize it!
Hubby: "Oh, is that that My-carrie-ah girl again? What's she doing?"  Me, trying to figure out how to pay to fix the car and rent: "Oh god, being successful and gorgeous." Hubby: "Man. I'd be jealous." Me: "I CAN'T. SHE'S TOO PURE. I JUST WANT TO SEE HER MAKE PRINCESS DRESSES ALL DAY." Hubby: "...."
Omgosh I'm so happy for you! It's utter PERFECTION! And you do deserve this.❤️❤️
Awww this makes my heart so happy
That house was literally made for you .
congratulations!!!!
I love it!
You are one of my favourite youtubers and im so happy to see you happy you deserve the best girl love you 💖💖💖also I'm following you from iraq🇮🇶💖
best friend you do deserve it ur an icon
Lol new house ikr don’t like
I want the type of love you have for youre house and someone to whisper to me the same way you said "I love you house, you make me happy ✨💕" 😭
I live with my parents, as evidenced by my mom just saying "Can you turn that video down? All that fast talking makes me nervous"
Congratulations 🎉 you DO DESERVE IT! You bring millions of.people joy with your creativity, authenticity and wit. Very well earned...the house is incredible
hi micarah!! just a note, the word you used at 11:48 to describe your tour is an outdated ableist word, i know it wasn't your intention but thought you would like to be told if the language you used could be potentially harmful! It has been used throughout history first used as a term in the medical field, and then in society as a way to belittle and other those who have cerebral palsy and other muscle related conditions, which then progressed to being used as an 'insult' outside of the context of those with muscle conditions.   i love watching your videos and can't wait for what you are gonna get up to in your new place🥰 you absolutely deserve all of the happiness and prosperity you have worked for💞
honestly you have made my day every time you post and you rightfully deserve it❤️
YOU DESERVE IT!!!
CONGRATS!!!! 🎉🎊🍾🎈
YOU BEING HAPPY MAKES ME HAPPY AND I HAD THE WORST DAY EVER BUT WHEN OTHERS ARE EXIDED IM EXIDED :D
Yayy!! So happy for you!! ❤️❤️
I'm happy for you.  Hope you enjoy your new home
I AM SO CUSSING PROUD OF YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!
“You should live with your parents until you can actually afford to leave” is now my favorite quote. I haven’t moved out of my parents house and I’m 35, so thank you.
Congratulations!!!
You deserve happiness and if it comes in the form of a house then that’s perfection.
Congratulations!!!! I'm so excited for you, investing in property is such a great thing. I also love you're choice of a very old house, my family live in a 1914 house and its ✨Wonderful✨! Nothing beats un-renovated (though certain updates are ok) old houses (pre-1960s generally, I like 1930s and older).
I literally spat out my tea at the titanic sink sponge moment.
Girl!!! I'm so proud of you Micarah! Miss you lots. ☺️❤️
WHAT??? YOU FCKING DESERVE IT
i’m really happy for her🥺🥺
And she's still funny and lovable,  money did not change her,  I hope the house wouldn't in the future 😂 love you! 😊😁
Honestly I feel such a strange type of joy for Micarah. Like it’s the same kind I get when something amazing happens for my friends. I know I’ll never meet her, but it’s like I know her and I just want the best for her. I’m so happy for you Micarah and we’re all so proud you’ve come this far! (Btw I’m actually gonna go fight the jerks who have been bothering you at your dads house, that’s 100% not okay)
I love how hardworking you are & the quality of your videos👌
FINALLY!! i commented on one of your videos yeaaaaars ago saying i hope you get a ton of subscribers and move out with youtube money. i'm so happy for you!
Can you please make a Katniss Everdeen dress?
"Cycling my creativity while working retail" omg! There IS hope!
Why is this house my dream house?? <3 Hope you stay safe Micarah!
Love your style! So excited for you!
SO HAPPY FOR YOU!!!
“I know I don't deserve this" your right you deserve so much more! 💛
omg we have the same bottle
Please be safe!
You should make the closet in your closet a giant mirror in the wall with different angles and lights...
legit tearing up :,)) im so happy for you!!! cant wait to see what you do with your house, you were already so creative with your rvs!!
Congratulations!!!!
but man im so happy for you!!! im starting the process of buying a house tooo!!!!!! but i have no credit at all so i have to get a credit card and buy gas and pay it off and then ill have credit and i can buy!!!!!
Fear of debt isn't irrational. You could be dead and your family will still pay for you. I don't want to burden people with that. I'm cool with holding on my money real tight. Better be stingy than drowning in debt.
I love you and I’m so happy for you and I can’t wait for you to make the house yours 💖💖
can you do a video of you remodeling the house kinda like you did with the rv, that vid was so funny😂
MICAAARAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!! CONGRATULATIOOOOOOOONNNNSSS!!!! 😍😎😍😎
That is a very nice house, well done not being precious about bathrooms ,yet.
I've never been more happier than this for someone with a new house
Can't wait to see your house in Hoarders.
Congratulations on your lovely new house!!!
awww congratulations on the house! Get simpisafe to sponsor you!
i can't even begin to describe the pure joy this video gave me
👁👄👁- OMG . . .   YA BOUGHT A HOUSE-
seeing her being so genuinely happy with her new house warms my heart, fuck you guys who tried to find her house tho. absolutely disgusting, i hope shit gets better with this house
I just realized that she can make people watch and enjoy things that nobody considered worth time before
💖💖💖
i too, don’t believe in sidewalks
Her happiness is *shining through the screen* I'm not joking, she's beaming in this video!
I started crying for you, happy tears. its so exciting to see you get your own house.
Soooo proud and happy for you! You deserve the best! ❤❤❤❤❤
It’s frankly too adorable how excited she is. I love it!
wait ur jokes are always unpredictable i didn't expect "i drink cake"
this could be a dumb quetsion. do you write scripts? before you shoot the video?
This made me want to happy cry more the any chick flick has😢😍😍
im glad i have been a teeny tiny part in making micarah's dreams come true. tbh it has been an honor
you 100% deserve this! seeing how genuinely happy this house makes you is really heartwarming ♥
Good to know, ive been follow8ng her for sometime now ad Im happy for this news
YOU DID IT!
First thing I thought when I saw the title was “girly if you’re living by yourself don’t make it obvious where it is!” And then you confirmed that you are a brilliant woman by not giving your location away. That really sucks that there’s creeps out there not respecting your boundaries. I totally see your next sponsors being home security, internet security and self defense products. If so- do it! Can’t wait to see how you thrive in this new space!
You deserve this beautiful! X
omMGGG :)
Micarah, you should name your house!
I'm gonna cry.
Awe I’m so happy for you!! I can’t wait to see what kind of shenanigans you’re going to film!!
Im so happy for u
I would be so intimidated by Micarah if I saw her walking down the street, but I love that she is just as goofy as she is gorgeous :P
im so happy for you ¡¡¡
At who was the creepy stalker of Micarah? I just wanna talk my guy 🗡🗡
Congratulations! I also love looking at houses eventhough I have one😁 It was built around 1900.
How cool it is to be able to have a place that is 100% your own.
When the video is so good you watch the whole ad
The little self affirmations she did at the ends is what I do when I get a new phone or something 😂😂
Definitely teared up for you by the end of this! Your gratitude was the 🍒 to this video!
Everyone has these magnetic lasses and they are so expensive
Yes I knew it I commented on the Instagram post the other day and it said guess what the gif news is and I said a new house!
pls invite me to ur house sign below if u want to be invited too:
You made me smile so much LOL especially in the last moments!!! So happy for you <3333 We could really tell how happy you are !!
not me tearing up :') im so happy 4 u micarah u deserve it!!!!
CONGRATULATIONS on getting your first house!
Lol i was caught off guard with "I drink cake"
Congratulations!!!
i fucking love how she weaved the illegal princess diaries bit into the nails at home bit, like it’s simple set up and pay off but she does it SO well and continues to do it PERFECTLY just EVERY TIME
I am so happy for you. That is terrable that someone found where you live. I hope they leave you alone and you are safe.
Man, it's like I'm growing up with you!! Seeing you move from your dad's house to an RV to a full on HOUSE AAAAH, a dream(!!!) As somebody who isn't very well off I can relate to the fear of debt, I'd also love to be able to buy my own house someday ^~^
Congratulations!!!! And many happy memories!
Billy Mayes who?
The fear of debt is so much better than our nation's addiction to it.
Your house tour was the most adorable thing ever and obvious gratitude renews my faith in humanity...at least for this evening.  Congrats!,🎉🎈🍾🎊
yaaa
Please recreate a look from the new Versace collection
Oh yeah, I totally get that Zillow addiction!! 😬
congrats💗
i legit thought you just came across an empty unlocked house, so i guess that shows how smart i am
congrats!! im so happy for you ! and stay safe !!
I am so happy for you omg, you’re so stinkin cute girl! I am so excited for the ensuing chaos.
Awesome sauce!! Bleep street is the best!
That was great, I love seeing someone so excited for something! :D Congrats on your new house!
OMG THE TITANIC SCENE 😭✋
This is going to be me when I get my own house! I’m so glad that you were able to accomplish this!  Edit: This may be me in JUST A FEW MONTHS! I have the money for a down payment AND closing costs! I have my loan set up AND I’m talking to a realtor! This is INSANE!
I can't wait to see future videos shot in YOUR house ahhhh
house,, in the middle of the house
Congrats!!!
I’m so crazy happy for you, Micarah! Your house looks incredible and it’s so good to see that huge smile...a few things from the last few videos make sense now you’ve revealed the stalker issues you’ve been facing. I hope the police are taking the issue seriously. It’s never, ever ok and it’s really scary to go through. I’m so sorry you’ve had to face this, you seem like such a lovely person and I hope this truly is the start of only bigger and better things for you!!!
CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AHHH!!!!! CUTE HOUSE!!!!
Omg you seem so happy!! Congratulations on your house!!
This is really weird but every time I think of fresh eggs and making dresses I think of you. 🥰
Congratulations 🎊
You look so genuinely happy I love it 🥰
u r awesome i love your vids :)
Congratulations 🎊🎈
Are you not going to film in your dads house anymore? I love it. So messy but wholesome and cozy.
🥳🥳🥳
I can relate to that fear of debt 😔
The only ad I look forward to.
Dude, I am just genuinely happy for her.
You absolutely deserve this. Even if it is a privilege and something many people won't have, it doesn't mean you don't deserve it. Everyone should be able to own a home and live comfortably. It's a good thing that you can.
omg i love u so much, congrats!! 🐉🐉
I’m so happy for you!!!
" i dont know witch one of you are the creepy ones.."  ....That would be me....
What an inspiration!! Follow your dreams, love on your parents, be yourself and dreams will follow!!!
you most certainly DO deserve this. Thanks for making us, your audience happy. It's your turn now to feel the happiness that you give us :)
You do deserve it. You are such a treasure and I’m so happy that we live in a time that that fact can be monetized to benefit you.
Is there a bedroom dedicated solely to the Ariana dress?
This video is so wholesome 😭 (except for the stalking part but anyway). I’m so happy for you! Also, I know we didn’t really see the house that well, but I’m pretty sure it’s super cute
I want to have a regency tea party!!
Oh mah gawd she's  no longer in a R V
$40 couch?! Where did you find it? It's a beautiful couch.
Omg this ad is EVERYTHINGGG
"That's a flaw. I like flaws. Nobody likes perfection."
Next video will be how she swears the house is haunted, as it creaks and groans.
I am so happy for you!!!!!!
This video convinced me to buy a house, and I'm not even old enough to own one
this video was so cute!!! you totally deserve this house and i’m so glad you found one that makes you this happy
Are the 17 diamonds part of your engagement ring? Or are you just super rich and fancy now that you own a house!?
the way I teared up at 7:45. Micarah you deserve this and more for being such a force of chaotic good
So happy for your Micarah! You've brought a lot of laugher and whimsy to all our lives when we so badly need it. You deserve all this and more!
This made me feel so happy and forget about my troubles! Congratulations and you so deserved your house!! 🥳
woah, im here before a million
Congratulations your hard work paid off!!!!❤️
"I know I don't deserve this," my girl, you've got 1.6 million subscribers that think otherwise. Congratulations on being a homeowner!
This just made life worth living again. Yaaaaaaaaaaaay!!!! <3
Gosh, it is SO beautiful... A craftsman costs about a million dollars where I live, and sadly, usually get torn down for ugly boxy modern condos. 😞 So glad you could get an older beautiful home with so many original features!!! 💖
MICARAH I AM SO HAPPY FOR YOU YOU DESERVE THE WORLD ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Congratulations and you completely deserve this house with how much you entertain me😊
*I DID NOT EXPECT TO SEE THIS I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER WITH GEREON IN YOUR RV I-* (congrats btw u deserve it and ilysm 💗🥳)
Im so happy for you 💖💖💖
YAYYYYY IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Youre a talented, funny, lovely young lady. Congrats on your new house, let the games begin!
👏👏💖
why is she a genius when it comes to promotes XD lmao
Similar to how I found my house!! Was looking at others, and Zillow recommended similar houses in the area, and despite being detached, it was listed as a condo (simply part of an HOA) so I never would have found it! Walked in, and knew it was the one!! And I take A LOT of time to research stuff..  but sometimes, you just know 😊
CONGRATULATIONS!!! <3 <3
Haha im allergic to eggs lol
you deerve this!! it makes me so happy to see you feel so happy in your new home :)    also can we collectively hate the men from the internet that feel the need to make women uncomfortable in their own homes youre gross
It's literally gave me so much joy watching how happy you where. I was so close to squealing in joy 😹
Congratulations on your new house .... I love watching your videos and will keep watching them too cuz I love testing my sewing skills
Micarah has the most amazing sponsor adds! They brought me much joy :)
I drink cake I can't oml
That house is gorgeous! I'm in love with the collums and that view in front of them with the stair case behind them!!! So freak gorgeous!!!
Congratulations 🎉 ❤️❤️
ok why did i actually think micarah convinced someone to go film in their house (btw congratulations !! :D )
Even the ads are a Masterpiece
Congrats girl
THE SEROTONIN THIS GAVE ME AHHHH
I usually skip the sponsored sections but I knew that anything Micarah does is the epitome of “I was homeschooled” humour so I watched it and it did not disappoint
Congrats!! 🎊🎉
YAY!!! We might be around to watch your videos but it was you who saved! You made the videos for us to watch! It was your hard work that got you here and you deserve every bit of goodness from it.  Also give me the info of those creepers, I'll fight.
Simply safe needs to sponsor you next
Omg what do you do with your canper
I watched the ending of this a few times just cause you're so happy and your joy is so present!
I'm soooooo happy for her
Awh how sweet. Congratulations on the house.
Awww congratulations
You DO deserve it. We didn't give you anything for free. You worked for it by making these awesome videos and making all of us happy!!
Omg plz do a Bridgerton themed tea party. 😭♥️
Congrats on your beautiful home, so happy for you!
AHHHHHH CONGRATULATIONS!!!!! Also the apology look was gorgeous
Her talking about her stalkers broke my heart; she seemed like she was really really scared.
hi!
Tewers they close
Seeing you this happy makes me happy too! You definitely deserve everything you have right now 💖
What kind of negative person thumbs downs a person's success.  This is amazing news!!!
Congratulations 🎉🍾🎊🎈 so happy for you and we are all here to keep helping with likes,comments and views thank you for amazing videos 🥰🥰🥰
Right on!  Seriously your new home is super cute and I don't know what I love more.  The kitchen that over looks the whole center of the home, the french back doors, the grand columns, or the overall cozy af feel.  Also I  am just in love with that staircase.  Super jealous. Congrats again for an excellent purchase!
Ugh that sucks you have stalkers. LEAVE MICARAH ALONE 😭  ♥️ Love the house girl it's beautiful ❤️
I totally get what you mean, but I don’t think it’s that you don’t deserve a house, it’s that a lot of people who do deserve a house don’t get one. In conclusion, you do deserve it and congratulations! 💛
I hope someday Micarah goes to college and studies fashion history!
You deserve it! You worked hard and saved your money ❤️
omg I could literally feel your excitement during the house tour :''D congratuladions💖💖💖
Micarah is a house hugger, and I am living for it.
OMG U BOUGHT A HOUSE AND I LOVE IT!!!!!! btw u do deserve that house u r such an amazing person and work so hard so u really do deserve that house and so so so much more and i know u  probably wont see this but i also wanted to that u, yr vids helped me get through my sever depression i would be having a really bad day and then i would watch yr vids and i knew everthing would get better and it has so thatnk u so so so much u r a real hero!
I'm so happy for you ❤️❤️
Congratulations
MOVING ON UP!!!!!! home girl got a home!!!!
Love you Micarah <3
Ahh congratulations! Part of me wishes that I could buy a house too.
I dont know you technically but I'm so proud ..............
Are you richh?? Cuz you have 2 rvs and a hpuse
Micarah you’re the only person whose ad content I will not skip!
Yay! Good for you! #taurusgangforthewin
Your make me want your life even more and I love it :)
I'm not proud of how I screamed at a lashless Micarah at 2:39   It was just so sudden
house....with the House font......yes!
congrats on your new house! We're all so happy for you Micarah
omg im so happy for you, I've literally been watching you since you had 2,000 subs and I'm so happy you've gotten  the subs you deserve
SO WHOLESOME I LOVE YOU AHHHHHHHH
CONGRAAAAAATS THIS HOUSE IS SO PERFECT !!!!
Congrats girl & be safe!
Throughout this entire video I'm just very proudly saying good for you every 5 mins lol I'm honestly so happy for you, like I am the one who bought a house XDDD
Congrats on the cute house!
Not me assuming it was way more on-brand that she was trespassing in an abandoned house before the thought even crossed my mind that she would maybe want to live in something bigger than a truck.
This is the best! So happy for you!
My sister just moved to cincy and had the same realtor issue lol
She is the only YouTuber who’s sponsor ship segments I won’t skip. They are just as funny as her videos... 💕
Whooo Hoooo! High five sewing sistuh!!
I drink cake...I- I’m done
The montage at the end reminded me of when Miss Honey adopts Matilda and they roller-skate in their living room, it’s so heartwarming 💕 im so excited for you!! I first started watching your videos in January of 2019 because my grandmother who had cancer really loved sewing and I wanted to learn more- your videos mean so much to me and always remind me of her so thank you
Anyone else notice how she kinda posed in the same way she did in the "I BOUGHT AN RV" video?
We've been waiting for this video for two years!!!! You deserve this so much!!!
are you gonna name your house???
The only ads I will ever willingly watch, thank you. Truly a masterpiece 😂. Also you 100% deserve this home ! this is the only channel I cannot live without. Keep being unapologetically you!
that house is so cute omg
Reincarnation is real lmfao
I'm sooo happy for you!!!! Congratulations!!!
Micarah is the only creator whose ads I don't skip. They're that entertaining.
Yessss
your happiness radiates through the screen like it's soo genuine and as genuine as I am so proud of how far you've come micarahhh I'm now stupidly smiling bcos of this awwwwwwwwwwwwwww
I want to write something witty, but mostly I just wanna say I’m so happy for you.
COGRATILATIONSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
OML CONGRATSSSS 🤩😍😍😍😍
No apology necessary. I actually won’t watch videos that are  over 14 minutes long.
CASA DE TEWERS 2.0
Why is micarah literally the purest human ever
seeing all her pure happiness is making me so happy right now...
Congrats on the house! Definitely read as "horse" at first and was really hype about you getting a horse, house is good too though.
AHHH ITS MADE FOR YOU !!!
Micarah is literally the definition of humble, and it just warms my heart.
OMG CONGRATULATIONS
I just watched your ads in full so you would get income from YouTube! You need as much as you can get to decorate your new digs.
I seriously started crying tears of happiness at the end when your smile changed and your voice went soft and you, “I have a house”.  It was the contented happiness.   I’m very happy for you.
I am simultaneously SO VERY HAPPY FOR YOU AND YOUR NEW HOUSE and ABSOLUTELY ENRAGED BY ANY MONSTER WHO WOULD STALK YOU AND FREAK YOU OUT!!! I can't wait to watch you work your magic on this amazing and beautiful home. I hope the monsters stay the hell away from you!
Congratulations
thank you for being on earth also your family
Congrats on the house! It’s a big responsibility. We got to watch our house getting built, wandered through the frame, stood in the fireplace…I think I was more excited for my daughter. I was excited to paint but now I’m tired of the color.  (It’s been 18 years.)
I'm sooo excited to see her renovation and decorating videos!!
house - i love you house - nice
she's got a house
I love love love your house, jumping and laying on my counters would be the first thing I’d do too  and roller skate because I could/can’t do that in my parents house❤️✨
This was the purest I just bought a house video. It’s amazing being able to see all of the changes that have happened in you life in just the last year or two. Congratulations and I hope it’s everything that you need and want.
Why did this make me emotional? I love your videos and I am so happy for you!!
HECK YEAH!!!
So incredibly happy for you! Sounds like your house makes you as happy as your videos make me! ^U^
Congrats! You deserve it.
You are the best!!
i've never watched such an engaging sponsorship ad
Congratulations!!!!!!
I love that you have found success just by being your quirky self and having a good time. ❤️ Congratulations!
Amazing house! Thanks for another entertaining video.
when you don't even skip Micarah's ads because they're so entertaining and weird lmaooo
Ahhhh!!!❤❤❤ Congratulations!! You deserve it!!
Ok wow the creepy people showing up to your dads house is so scary.  Im so sorry that happened hope ur ok
If youtube pays enough for a house mortgage free in a couple years with a million subs, youtube is paying way too much. Happy for you, but SMH.
I'm really happy for Micarah, except the fact that she was being stalked. BUT CONGRATULATIONS FOR NEW HOUSE!!
Congratulations, Miss Tewers. You are very talented and you do deserve to enjoy the fruits of your labor. And now if you’ll excuse me I’m going to order some of those lashes for ladies over 50. 😏
Yeah, you only need one bathroom until you have plumbing problems, or your a-hole brothers visits and sets up camp while he evacuates his massive bowels... so glad to have two... bathrooms, not brothers. I could do with fewer than the one I have....brothers no bathrooms
that house is STUNNING oh my gosh
Yay! It's a great house, can't wait to see what you do with it! So happy for you, Micarah!
I remember this feeling buying my first house. It's kind of hard to believe even as you fall asleep in it and wake up in it. Sadly, I sold that house a few years ago when I moved and I don't like my new house as much I loved that first house. But still, I remember that feeling. Enjoy it.
You do deserve this. Mostly for staying humble and funny and greatful.  Also get some home security. Creeps be creeps.
That’s terrible hearing about the creeps
May we be friends?
Happy house!
GIRL THAT'S SO EXCITING SO PROUD OF U
just bc of u im starting to think on buying a big vintage but still modern house and im still in highschool-
congrats. it is well deserved.
You definitely deserve it. We all wish we could buy houses and im glad youve been given that chance. Hopefully more of us get the same chance! :D
CONGRATS! you deserve it!! hope you stay safe in your new heaven
Yasssss honey
FUN FACT: you share a birthday with my mom. :)
I'm very happy and proud of you. Your house is very nice. I like it a lot. I don't know about you but the first thing I would do is upgrade the security like door striker plate screws from 3/4 inch to 3 inches. The longer screws make it more secure. Also consider replacing the striker plates from the small ones to longer more beefy type that will take a punch. Go around the house and install windows locks and outdoor lighting to illuminate dark areas. Always cut your lawn because an uncut lawn tells criminals you might not be home or are rarely home. Put a lock on your outdoor electrical panel. Criminals like to open your panel box and turn off the power to your house to see if anyone is home, so lock it up. if your front door has glass all over the place replace it with one that is mostly solid wood or covered in steel. It shouldn't be possible to crack a simple window and reach in to unlock the door. Now that you live alone always have a spare key on you when ever you leave your house. believe it or not people lock themselves out of their house a lot. When they do they realize they don't have a spare key anywhere on them. If you plan on hiding a key outside of your house it shouldn't be a simple place. I don't like the idea of hiding a key or having one outside but everyone is different. Best wishes.
Congrats!!!
Omg I am so happy for you you totally deserve this! 😁
What a wonderful surprise! We really had NO IDEA you bought a house. Lol Congratulations! So happy for you. God is so good! 🙂
Congrats girl! You deserve it. Always so humble. :D
The one sponsor bit I actually watched and enjoyed 😁 You are a treasure!
Watching her have a house makes me happy ^_^. I've got a few years to go, but also aiming debt free! Enjoy your home!! Looking forward to seeing you make it your own.
@13:10 I'm the creepy one. Now you can invite everyone else. :) Jokes aside. You very much deserve it! Congrats!
I wished for this 😍
This was the cutest thing ever 😭congrats Micarah!!
You are giving me Netflix Sabrina the teenage witch... But make it fun. Like real fun.
You got your 14 min vid lol 😊
□ _Single_ □ _Taken_ ■ _Living vicariously through Micarah~♡_
So happy for you! I love your new home. It has a lot of character.
all of this happens because of you, YOU. you're talented and entertaining, that's what makes people takes interest on watching your video. it's not because of us, all we did is click on your video and watch you being amazing
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
She looks so happy!! Now I'm happy! 😆😆
Gotta watch the ads through ofc 😌
You do deserve the house. It's going to be fun seeing how you're going to customize the house :D
Congratulations on your house! 🥳🥳 It’s honestly an amazing achievement in this day and age...pretty sure the only way I will ever be able to get a house is if I make it a la WandaVision
I feel like one of your new neighbors could potentially be your soulmate???????
Moving out! It's a good feeling
CONGRATS 🥺🥺💕💕💕
Congratulations!!!! I love this! I can't wait to see what you do with this gem on Bleep Street! ❤ You're awesome!

I’m so so proud of you and thankful. For the joy,  the laughter and the DIY videos that it helped me get through not only high school but my now second year of college. Love you and so happy for you!
CONGRATSS DEAREST!! I'm sooo happy for you, you deserve it soo much! You bring us so much happiness and childlike creativity and fashion and beauty and hilarity. We love having you as a part of our lives ❤❤❤ Enjoy your house and keep your privacy❤❤ I'm so sorry you had to go through all that, that's frightening...

I love your house! (And I’m not creepy)
Micarah, if you don't get a Super Bowl level ad one day...a True Crime.
I love seeing how happy Micarah is about her new house! You really deserve it! :')
Who gave this a dislike? Ya'll sad because you don't have a house.
Awwwwww yay!!!!
I can't wait to see you become Dr. Dolittle in a few months with the amount of animals you plan to fit into your house.
Im beyond proud of you and soooo happy to see you thrive! You inspire us sewers so much. Youre living proof that the dream is still achievable. Youre one of my biggest inspirations and this just gives me so much hope and motivation. Thank youuu and congratulations!
Yay!!! Congrats! May it always be filled with joy and laughs!
the genuine happiness you have makes me so happy! Congratulations 👏
"I don't believe in sidewalks"
IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU!!!!!!! you are a source of joy for me right now and I am so happy that you are happy if that makes sense. A snake eating its own tail of happiness, if you will.
You deserve this so much <3 thank you for bringing us joy
Congratulations you deserve it all. Girl u don’t know how happy you make me feel, mostly because your sooooo funny you make my day. 😂😂😂
Congratulations!
this was so sweet aww we're happy for u!!
You must dress Victorian in this castle. Lady Micarah.
You deserve every square inch of that house. Thanks for all the laughs and good times.
You earned this house.  I'm happy for you!
i feel bad that women cant feel safe in their own home because of some weirdos out there
Congratulations! Enjoy your new home! Stay safe.
I’m sooo happy for you ! You deserve it so much ! I can’t wait to see you decorating ! I’m happy that you are so happy
You are so awesome and deserve every happiness!  Congratulations!  Enjoy!  I can’t wait to see all the wonderful ways that you decorate and have fun in your new home!
“I’m very particular about which laws I break.” -Micarah
$40!!!!! I need the address to the thrift store, also Congratulations🎉🎉🎉
I’m so happy for you ! That is a beautiful house !!!!
Stop making ads entertaining I'm confused and want to continue hating ads!!!!!!!!!!!
Congratulations!!!
my happiness for you is like im the one whos got a house...thats how happy i am for you!!!!
Absolutely on the front of living with your parents if they want you there and you can't afford a place of your own! It's ok to ask for help! Financial security is mature and responsible. Also student debt is horrible.
wow i’m so happy for you! you do deserve this!!!
"You believe in reincarnation?" "No, but they might." can I please hire you as my real estate agent?
Let me tell you when I saw the title I was like, “WHAT”
Dont worry I feel the exact same way about loans and mortgages
not me wanting her to make a dress out of that piece of carpet she showed
aaaaaaaaaaa this makes me genuinely excited and happy like i bought a house !!!!! congrats on the house micarah !!!!
this is so sweet and pure.🥺
Soooo happy for youuuu ❤️❤️❤️❤️
But what if I was made after 1910?
So dissapointed that it's not an cheap old house that you'll renovate into your dream house, but congratulations on the new pad! 🥰
Omg wow your house is soooo beautiful
I really hate it when you do a Glamnetic promo cause you remind me every time that I can't buy them 🙂
Congeatulagions!! I'm laying down on my phone and that awkward typing came out, I almost fixed it, but then I realized you like that kind of weird stuff 🎊🎉🎊🎉🎉🎉🎉
Yay finall
Congratulations!!!
AHHH IM SO HAPPY FOR U I LOVE THIS SM
🔥🔥🔥
omg
i never skip her ads LMAO theyre entertaining as fuck
Gerreon is the luckiest bird in the world.  You should do a dress where he helps you pick the fabric.
Guys, we should really be congratulating her on getting her video to exactly 14 minutes
Congrats! You should buy a dog just in case those creepy people try to follow you.
I feel like you are the future of infomercials... 🤣 Congrats on the house. The red fabric and  white ish couch surface are a mood.
Congratulations!
"How about I make you some scrambled eggs."  That is exactly what my husband says to our kids all the time! Too funny.  They are 23, 23, 20, and 18 years old.  I hope they live with us as long as they want and until they can afford their own place.  There is nothing wrong with it.  I'm sorry you had trolls literally trolling you.  No one deserves that.  I'm excited for you and your new home and look forward to watching you decorate it and host interesting dress up parties with your friends.
Congratulations on your new house!!😁😁
IT'S BEAUTIFUL!! Congrats!!
why was the glamnetics ad just as entertaining as the video???? how does she do it
Her sponsorship portions are the only sponsorship portions I will watch all the way through
Congratulations!!
You’re house is super cool... on another note you made me realize that I’m probably going to accumulate a ton of college debt... haha I’ll just be in debt the rest of my life
You have the best work ethic on YouTube! You deserve it!
Yay!
Me: "youtube to mp3" whoops. Its not illegal if you dont get caught
Congrats on your new house..
Congratulations!!!
You absolutely do deserve this house. You chose to introduce the internet to your humor, your charisma, and your creativity! I stumbled upon your videos a long time ago while falling into a YT hole of sewing videos even though I don't sew and I'm glad I stayed! <3 Girl, congrats!!!!!
You convinced me to buy the lashes, they just look so pretty on you.
Congratulations!
Seeing you so happy about your house literally made my whole day, you’re amazing and wonderful and deserve your happiness!!
You do deserve it!!
I cried through the whole thing. I'm STILL crying. I'm so very happy for you. It's a beautiful house and I can't wait to see what you do with it! Yay!
Congratulations, Micarah! You bring us joy and laughter with every video. So happy you get some joy of your own! Sending homeschooler blessings to your new house! 😃🥳💖🙌🏡✨🎆🎇🎆
Micarah please sew a Edwardian Dress to match the house
YESSSS
What is with people stalking Youtubers? Like I know you’re not okay upstairs, but do something useful with your life, please do us all a favor, and just, mind your own damn business. K. Thank you. Also, so happy you bought a house Micarah lol, I’m so used to the RV’s, gonna have to adjust to this change 🤣
I'm so happy for you!! You absolutely deserve this!!! (And very sorry creeps were bothering you)
OMG CONGRATULATIONS yall we should start a go fund me and give her money as a house warming gift to buy furniture or stuff for her next video
Congrats!!! This is so amazinggg
Congratulations! I’m so glad you live on bleep street and can enjoy your home in joy and safety 🛠
I'm SO HAPPY FOR YOU!!!!!! <3 <3 <3
OMG this is a sign! I'm 25 and I've been wanting my own house for years now. I've resolved to find one in the next few months and for some reason I FEEL that this is the time to buy. Seeing you get a house too just solidified my resolve. Thanks for sharing!😊
Ive never been this happy for a stranger from the internet
did I hear that right? did she just say she put a costume on road-kill?!        [no I'm not going to rewind- I'm to lazy for that.]
Micarah is the only person that could make me rewatch a sponsorship
"I know I don't deserve this" GUURRRLL if we could give everything in the world we would cause all of your viewer's know that you deserve the world.
Congrats girlfrienddd :) I believe in you and god bless
AND YOU DESERVE THE WORLD so happy for you!!
Vicarious excitement- I go get pre-qualified to get my own house tomorrow!!! You go girl!!!
Congratulations! This was so sweet to watch. 😌 You are absolutely lovely and deserving of your house!
Love your vids, but you are showing too much of your house. Don't dox yourself!
Idc : I drink cake
Congratulations, when I saw the pink I was like "yes, it's Micarah's"  Quick question, are you going go be leaving the barbie car at your dads or are you going to have it at your new house?
I've also been on Zillow 24/7! I am getting surgery this week though so that's all my down payment and then some, gone. I also have never been in a significant amount of debt (mix of stinginess and luck/privilege) so that will be weird if I'm able to do it.
So happy for you!!! I love your dad reactions btw haha
Oh my god I am so so happy for you!! Congratulations, you totally deserve it 👑
I’m so so happy for you and proud of you, you deserve everything love you a lot and I wish visiting you one day maybe hehe 💞 ( Her excitement while she tells us is priceless 🥺)
What an iconic video. This house gave her room to grow so now her jokes are just *chef kiss*
I didn't get my own house but your genuine happiness about yours is just bleeding through my screen and I just can't help but feel so happy for you 🤧❤️ I'm just one of many of your fans, but thank you for being such an inspiration and source of happiness to many of us!! I'm now excited to also get my own house... even though that's gonna take a while 👀 All the love from Philippines ✨

i choked on my crepes watching the real titanic play out 😂😂😂
I usually skip it when youtubers talk about sponsors,  but not for you!
Happy new house x
I absolutely refuse to believe you're any older than 21 what🤯
This is awesome!  Congratulations!  I have a similar story: I bought my tiny shack fixer-upper one bathroom house though an auction that no one else bid on and after getting all my paperwork done I shouted at people on my way to my new house that "I bought a house!"  Cuz I felt everyone should know 😆🙃
Congratulations!!! You deserve this and so much more!❤
It’s beautiful! My husband and I bought our first home in December and sometimes we still feel like a government official is going to tell us we aren’t adult enough to own such a nice house 😂
What a lovely house! Congratulations - it will be wonderful home!
Reason 3 is a genuine reason for me too.
"I know i dont deserve this" BITCH you really do know nothing because yes you do <3
congratulations!!!!!
if u host a victorian tea party invite me im not creepy i swear         i mean-if u want to or not thats fine  *cries*
I KNEW IT!
What do you mean you don’t deserve it you worked for it congrats 😊
You had BETTER cut 13:02 from this video right this second, because you 100% deserve all of this and more! It’s your creativity that draws all of us in, like moths to your intensely glowing flame, giving us no choice but to subscribe lest we miss out on one second of your hilarious, delightful, wholesome, punny-as-heck content. Congratulations, girl. This is only the beginning!
ALSO ITS BASICALLY A 1 YEAR ADOPTION ANNIVERSARY FOR GARRION (or however you spell his name bahahah) AAAAH
SO SO SO SO SO excited for you,  Micarah!! <3 you deserve all the happiness! So happy this dream came true for you!

My grandpa offers an insane amount of eggs as well. Although it might be because he has a farm. "Emmy you want me to fry you an egg?" " Hey try my scrambled eggs I put basil in there this time" "Emily get over here and see how big this egg is. I think it'll have double yolks" and the thing is is that I hate eggs. I had a bad farm egg when I was like 10 and haven't touched them since. It does wear on a person.
This is day 1 of asking Micarah if she wants eggs  hey Micarah, want some scrambled eggs?
Congrats! Your obvious happiness makes me happy too.
OMG THAT IS AMAZING I AM SO FRICKEN EXCITED FOR YOU AND TO SEE ALL THE AWESOME THINGS YOU’LL DO WITH IT ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

The word mortgage is derived from a Law French term used in Britain in the Middle Ages meaning *"death pledge" * and refers to the pledge ending (dying) when either the obligation is fulfilled or the property is taken through foreclosure. The definition of mortgage is spooky.
"i don't deserve this" uhhhhh. what?
It was so heartwarming to see how happy Micarah is, you can clearly see she's overjoyed and that made me smile too!
Ahhh! congratulations!
😭😭😭 i am so happy for you!!
I knew it🥰

Best ad ever

Congrats!  Now get some plants!
CONGRATULATIONS!!! Really happy for this next chapter in your life Micarah! :)
My husband and I bought our first house last year and I can't even count the number of times I literally cried thinking about it. Basically, next to my salvation in Christ, my marriage, and my kids, my house is the best thing ever. 😂
You deserve it all girl! So proud of you and happy for you!! 💕
Micarah you are the only youtuber that I don’t skip the sponsored sections of because you just make it SO entertaining
IM SO HAPPY FOR YOUUU, EVEN BE4 I STARTED THE VIDEO
Imagine having THE Micarah Tewers as your neighbor..."yep she's out there in a ninja turtle costume with her rat again"
This is your best video! Somehow you’re just so inspiring
Micarah-- could you please hire my husband to come make your new house sound awesome and get us out of the way expensive state we currently live in? We want to move back to the Midwest so bad!! But he hasn't found audio or software work in the Midwest that will get us back there... We are stuck here... And we miss the Midwest...
This person just made a 5 minute sponsored ad entertaining... juat H- H-  How?
Eeeeeeey 14 minutes exactlyyyy
If I was invited to your house I will go into harry Potter's room and never to be seen again
Queen of the infomercial
You have EARNED THIS. You give so much joy to your viewers and the fact that we could give something back to you, even indirectly, is so so incredibly amazing. Congrats!
This video made me giddy with joy!! (but also kinda angry at whoever's stalking you, I'm so sorry that happened) You totally deserves your dream home and I couldn't be happier for you!! Looking forward to all the house makeovers videos ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Best lash ad EVER. I'm SOLD 😌💸 Happy for you Micarah, you deserve all good things!💖
I am also in a relationship with my house. I just rent, but I knew I was home the moment I walked in to check it out. It's wonderful to be in the perfect home, and living alone is the absolute best. Congratulations on your new relationship. 🥰
I *PROMISE* I'm not one of the creepy ones...can I come over?!?!  Oh okay....but still, you TOTALLY deserve your beautiful new house!!!  You are my favorite person I don't know.  How can one person be so beautiful, hilarious, whimsical, AND also so incredibly sensible???  Every time I see one of your videos it brightens my day!  Thank you for continuing to make videos for us!
I'm so sad that people have been so creepy. 😥 I'm glad that you are taking charge of your privacy,  good for you. ❤
I am so so so happy for you. I can't think of a single youtuber who could deserve this more than you. I will enjoy very much watching you personalize your house. Ps: I cryed at the end of the video. Seeing  you so happy was just overwhelming.
i LOVE those brown shoes you're wearing for most of this video, they're so cute and they look so comfortable, i hope i find a pair like that at a thrift store eventually
I can’t even handle how much I love you.  We all do.  You absolutely deserve this.  Thank you for being you ❤️❤️
Agree 100% on living with your parents until you can leave. That's how I was raised, and I feel like a more grounded person because of it. I wish everyone could have the same opportunity
yo DO deserve all of this ur a HUGE inspiration to me and I LOVE YOU
I’m sooooo HAPPPYYYY FOR YOUUUUU ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
wow sabrina
Ok but.. that sponsor hahaha i mma want to purchase eyelashes even tho i dont use them
I have the same velvet skirt from Zara or h&m I don't quite remember
congratulations!! im so happy for you, you deserve the best life has to offer!! i hope you love the house and have all the fun victorian and regency tea parties your heart desires!!!
This was sincerely amazing. You do deserve this! Yes, I will buy your lashes. 😵 Honestly, this is something I've been striving for myself for the first time in my adult life and it's so reassuring to know it's attainable, and can be at a young age, with some serious creativity. A home is a GREAT thing to buy if you work straight out of high school. Live at home as long as you can, talk to your parents about them keeping a low rent in a savings account for you when you can afford to move out. This is all solid advice more young people need to have, and especially for those who have also thought they would be stuck having to marry up. Lol. I completely relate to that. It feels so good doing this on my own, though, and I think that's the tone that comes across. Micarah deserves this. Every single woman deserves financial independence and her own home, and to feel safe in it. ❤
Just realised this video is also 14 minutes long... What is she planning?
I’m so happy for you 🥺!
I want you to buy a pig... I don't know why I think about it... But I heard pigs are cute... And I can't have a pig.. 😅
i think being afraid of debt is pretty normal and rational
ok but like im not creepy nooo not creepy definitely not creepy why am I still typing i swear I'm not creepy
You deserve it ! 🤗🤗🤗
CONGRATS 😭😭😭😭😭 u deserve it! your videos are amazing. ur personality, ur talent with clothes, ur humor, UR EDITING, AMAZING 😻 hope garrion can memorize the new massive floor plan soon!!!
So happy for you 😁❤️ owning a house has been a lifelong dream of mine, as I'm sure it is for others.  I hope you have many happy years in it and make lovely memories.
You could see how happy you are 🥺💙 congrats !!! Seriously that’s amazing
uhhh im the creepy one, lucky for you i live in another country :)
Gratulations I love the house😁😊🏠🏠
Congrats girl!!!!
WOOOOO!!! YOU GO!!
Girl, congratulations!!!! You totally deserve this!🥰🥰🥰🤩🤩🤩🤩
So Touching....
Congratulations🎊🎊🎊🎊🎊🎊
Congratulations! You are hilarious and so pretty! ❤️
Congrats on the house. You deserve it. You are a great person. We are proud of you. 🎈🎈🎈🎁🎁🎁🍷🍷🍷♥️♥️♥️🍻🍻🍻
I barely watch her but I saw she bought a house and I was like: WAIT A DAMN MINUTE
OOH THIS MADE ME EXCITED!
Why am I crying?? I'm so happy for you! You absolutely deserve this!
Congratulations❤❤❤
Cool. I just found out that I'm allergic to latex
I DID listen to old time rock and roll while watching the clip, and I want you to know that your spin timed PERFECTLY with the music
Welcome to the homeowners life! That house looks beautiful; I hope you enjoy it for years to come.
Not gonna lie, this was informative and a great way to convince me to work hard to buy my own house and a bird.
I hope your going to be showing us the renovations, I wanna see it turn into a pretty house fit for pretty lady things.
Have you seen that tik tok of the fuzzy worm and "Somebody come get herrr" playing in the background?
I have to wonder if glamnetic properly appreciated the titanic promo skit
Micarah come on. You deserve the house. I'm happy for you.
OH MY-
Ok Regency parties? I'll need an invite. 🤣 Jk i live in MA. That would be quite a carriage ride. 🤣
Why did you make a third of your video an ad tho? Not mad about spons the ratio of actual video to advertising was just frustrating
I'm so happy for you ong
DOES THAT MUG SAY “I NEED COFFEE PIG TIME”??? IF IT DOES I HAVE THE SAME ONE ILYY

Congrats T o T I adore  how the only comment your dad had about your letter was “you believe in reincarnation?” LOL I can see where your hilarious and genuine personality comes from!!!
I love it hey!!
U do deserve this uve worked so hard I'm so happy for u
“This is where Harry Potter will sleep when he comes to visit” ugh jealous
YAS GIRL. YAAAASSS ❤️❤️❤️
congrations!
It is deserved Micarah. You wouldn't have gotten to the point you have without being so funny and genuinely entertaining to watch. You inspire me to be more true to myself even if that is being what others may call weird sometimes. I also loved your outfits in this video!
Gorgeous home! Congratulations. You definitely deserve this, because you provide a lot of amusement and enjoyment to people all over. I'm sorry you had creepos coming after you, though. Stay safe!
YOU BOUGHT MY DREAM HOUSE (plus another bathroom tho)
Honestly the dream I'm so happy for you and your son (Garrien)
I’m so happy for you 💛
had to stop the video at 4:26 to give it a like. Incredible
Umm, which was the chicken room?
God is good! I look forward to my regency invitation, I mean a house with that size, and wood floors is made for dancing..
Love you Micarah and so happy you bought a house.... but does half the video need to be an ad?
I smiled through this whole video I’m so glad she sooo excited!!
I want a house too, but I live in Boston 😭
I love her ads hahaha
Those shoes-
Congratulations! You truly deserve this house, your absolute excitement for your accomplishment is so wholesome & genuine, it's so touching ❤️ very happy for you. All the best girl.
Congratulations Micarah! You totally deserve this 😊
Her right hand shoullda gotten the Oscar 4:28
This is so cute! I am so happy for you!!!!
Yay!
She should...honestly probably avoid filming with the windows in near view. Ashley from Bestdressed had similar issues because people found out where she was from the view of the street/buildings from her windows. It's extremely creepy, but a genuine danger.
OML this was poted at 4 am and i missed the notification T-T
can't wait for the incoming interior design instagram polls
im so happy for u 🙂
so happy for you! :')
What !! Omg yay
not me actually playing "old time rock and roll" when she asked
each  time i wacht your vidos  they make simle you desrv this new  hoouse congarts
Anyone else LOLing at the semi colon joke? 🤣🤣🤣 (hope it's not just me)
I really I appreciate that you take your time to do the sponshorship some youtubers just recite them then move on♥️
Congrats!! Why do you not have your own show by now? So entertaining and well thought out!! I think your sponsor videos are the only ones I don't forward through!!
Okay I love the matching curtains, pillows, and shirt they are 🤌✨mwah✨🤌
this made me smile today :)
She definitely reminds me of Felicity Smoak
My families house came with 3 bedrooms and one bathroom. It was renovated to have 5 bedrooms and two bathrooms
Congratulations!!
This is so adorable omg 🥺🥺🥺🥺 congrats
Yayyyyy!!! You have an entire sewing room!!!
Funny my wacky father always offered eggs too. I don't like eggs unless their hard boiled or hard fried. No gooey yolks.
Awwww this is so great! 😍
You look so radiantly happy and we are happy for you!!
Congrats! I was concerned about you living in a trailer. So proud of you about your frugalness.
you look like kate mckinnon
Gasp
congrats!
Another youtube I follow turn from small unknown creator into be able to buy their own.. Its amazing and inspiring!  Me too I hope will be able to buy my own home..
You are amazing and you deserve your beautiful home I  hope you have a good day!!!
The sheer joy in this video makes me so happy. Congratulations!~
You look so excited tho. Glad to see you look that happy. And one day, I want to buy a house too, just like you huhuhu. And I just wanna say that, your house is pretty and perfect too me💗
So does this mean she owns 3 homes now?
YOU DESERVE THIS!!!! You have put so much work into the channel and you deserve every bit of your happiness and excitement from your accomplishment. Wow I sounded somewhat smart.
you know how  you said that the room under the stairs was Harry Potters room well take the door off and then make it your parets room
OMGGGG congraaaaats Micarah!!! I'm so happy for you 😻😻😻 really looking forward to the tour once you personalize it!
Congratulations! Also, I feel like that roll of carpet in the closet is going to end up in a future outfit.
Watching Micarah for a few years now, this video just makes me so happy for her (I was gonna say “proud” but I thought it’d sound weird). She’s incredibly deserving of this house, which is absolutely beautiful btw, cuz she’s worked so hard and has grown over the years whilst staying true to herself and not letting this whole YouTube thing get to her. Micarah, I know you said you don’t drink so let’s all celebrate the accomplishment with some apple juice 🥂.
I am so happy for you too. I just bought my first house too at a young age and it's amazing!
I love you Micarah!! I've been watching forever and I'm so glad you found your house :)))
You deserved the house 😭🙏
You are me outload you deserve this and more sweetie thank god I found your channel ♡
i love your commercial voice
Congrats!
I'm super jealous. Just so jealous. Your house looks fantastic. And I am so happy for you
how can someone be so pretty? like WOW your BeAuTiFuL lol i don’t wanna sound weird but she is!  Like if you agree :)
Aw that was awesome! I'm almost 50 and unless I get a popular social media presence, which, let's face it, won't be happening, I'll never be able to own one myself, but I'm so happy for you! It's very byootiful!! 😁☮️
You actually make me wanna but the lash and nailsssss
Omg congrats! You really look happy 🥺🥺
Yay!! I’m so happy for you!!!
YES YOU DESERVE A HOUSE!
Micarah, this video was so heartwarming and joyful, I'm so happy for you! You deserve it all!! ❤️
I can't wait for the tea parties 💕
for sum reason the last part made me tear up a bit jlJSKLAJ u deserve this ma'am <3
Yessss I’m so proud of you ❤️
“Ur ears will bleed I hope u don’t mind” what?!🤔   👁👄👁
Micarah is the only youtuber I can watch a whole video from because she makes my ADHD go brrrr and I don't get bored or distracted because there's always something to focus on :D
Go, girl I'm so happy for you! You just inspired me to work harder for this practical research class I despise from the bottom of my heart.
i hope to see at least one house makeover video in the future. the house looks fantastic- but i hope to god you repaint those teal walls
CONGRADULATIONS!!!!!!! I actually just bought a house on Christmas and still get giddy thinking about MY HOUSE. You definitely deserve it! You worked hard for it! Enjoy it!
Around holidays every year, someone in our neighborhood takes roadkill, dresses it up for the theme of the holiday, and puts it in a small chair in a spot that greets most people as they drive into the area. I think they got caught, I haven't seen it in awhile... 🤦‍♀️
What have you named your house?    Gladys? Ethel?  Blanche? Dorothy?
Genuinely happy for you micarah💕💕💕
She is so thrilled! I'm so happy for her!. I love Micarah!!!!
This is the best ad I have ever seen in my life. I want glamnetic lashes NOW
I’m so happy for you ❤️
I’m so excited for the renovation vids!!!
I'm so happy for you ❤
Congrats!! Is it just me or on some angles she looks like Doja Cat 😂😂😂😂 maybe i'm drunk
Congratulation!! OMG I'm so happy for you girl! 💜💜💜💖
Harry Potter doesn't need to make reservations, he is her first guest.

Congratulations, buying a house is a huge milestone!! And 100% don't share the location or front of the house, people are crazy.
It makes me mad that people would disrespect your home and sense of safety like that.  I’m sure some of them were just shy and trying to be nice, but oof, that is not the way to go about it.  Just because you’re on YouTube and you’re a nice person doesn’t mean people are allowed to violate your boundaries.    Ngl, I am super curious about what the outside looks like since I love Victorian and colonial homes but I’d rather you feel safe.  And this home is so pretty.  I love that tufted couch and it’s perfect for a sitting room.  I’ve only seen a few of your videos but you’re always such a joy to watch.    I hope the chimney wasn’t completely removed and that chimney repairs to make that fireplace functional is within the realm of possibility for you (if that’s something you want)  I’m excited to see how you make this beautiful house your own.

Hi, of you're reading this and are one of the ones following her and sliding letters under her door - stop. She's scared. We are all scared about these things. What if a stranger did that to you? How would zou feel? She does not want to get to know you. She wants privacy and doesn't want to hide and have to be so careful out of fear.
This might sound bad but I never realized how awesome it would be to own a house. You have so much freedom. Congratulations on your new house!!

I’ve done many crimes, I’ve stolen bananas from my parents 😌
What made you think some of us are creepy stalkers and you can’t trust us with your new address?  *tries to sew back on ear I was planning on mailing you* 👂 🪡
Who just found her and now is obsessed  Well me
Went from having all the misadventures in the RV to a full on house now, next time Micarah's gonna buy a warehouse and we wouldn't be prepared at all
Congrats on the house! One thing I do hope you invest in is security! Being alone with an unknown stalker out there means you need to take active steps to preventing anything going bad. Maybe some window alarms and cameras all around the perimeter?

I can just see that red curtain being turned into a dress
Congratulations Micarah! You deserve all of life’s blessings x
CONGrattsSS
You are beautiful and funny and energetic and inspirational and absolutely deserving of whatever putting all that special blend into the world creates. The others in your life are pretty cool too.
I'm so happy for you!!!!!
I just wanna know what your budget was. 😂 I want an old house I can remake!
That’s so cool! Congratulations!!!!
I'd like you to know that in celebration of your VERY DESERVED house-buying I DID play Old Time Rock'n'Roll during that clip and it was perfectly timed 💖
So incredibly happy for you! Love this for you!!
Congratulations! From one ohio homeschooler to another! Xoxo P.S. you ABSOLUTELY DO DESERVE IT! 💯
How do I get an invite to those tea parties, thoooo?
bruh why do you need to apologize- getting exactly 14 minutes on valentines day is an achievement- gurl- you are making me wheeze
OMG I am the same way! There are a few kinds of houses from the 20s that I love, but I LOVE love Victorian Houses. There's so many in my neighborhood and I have so much envy! House is so freakin' cute! Congratssss! I'm also afraid of debt so you're living my dream! So deserved!
So gosh dang excited for you. Don't ever say you don't deserve it, because you surely do. CONGRATS! 💛💛😘😊
i cant believe she took away the hardwood half panels they were one of the best things
Hell yeah zillow is the best lol
I’m literally so proud of this girl, like she deserves every ounce of happiness life has to offer. We all love you and are so proud of you Micarah!!!
I'm so happy for you!!! You deserve all love, opportunities, and happiness in this world💛
This was the only publicity I ever watched on purpose
Congratulations  I'm so happy for you 🤗🤗🤗
Congratulations!!!

🚨🚨🚨DON'T TRACK DOWN PEOPLE ON THE INTERNET AND VISIT THEM. 🚨🚨 I REPEAT 🚨🚨. DO NOT INVADE PEOPLE'S PRIVACY AND MAKE THEM FEEL UNSAFE. YOU ARE THE WORST KIND OF PERSON IF YOU MAKE SOMEONE FEEL UNSAFE IN THEIR OWN HOME 🚨🚨🚨
You are just the best thing ever. 💋
I saw the video title earlier and was like omg Micarah uploaded, but I was in class so I couldn't t watch it. So after class I saw the title and was like oh she got a horse? Huh, that makes more sense. For a second I thought she got a house.😅   ... Oh wait 😢
girl you deserve the house!!!! you don’t need a disclaimer for buying your dream home. happy for u!!!! ☀️😍💜
You deserve this 10000000%. You make so many people (including myself) so happy and always giving us a great laugh.  P.S. I'm glad you didn't show the front of your house. Too many scary people on the internet :( Congrats congrats congrats!!!!
you are so pure my love, your happiness makes me happy
I LEGIT READ THE TITLE AS I BOUGHT A HORSE AND KEPT WONDERING WHERE THE HORSE IS AT
im so happy for u :') its so cute<3

CONGRATULATIONS!
Holy god, this is a dream, right?
Does anyone else remember 500k??
Only u can make ads entertaining
you say we shouldn't live your house until we can live comfortably on our own. Bold of you to assume we live comfortably with our parents lol
You bring us so much joy and happies, that you should have no question that we're *thrilled* for you!  Congratulations and enjoy it!
Haha! It's like 2 at night in Greece and this video made me so happy! I'm so freaking happy for you! I can't wait to see what you'll decorate it with! I always feel you're the weird cool aunt from the movies with the interesting house lol can't wait yay!! 🤗
YAY
Are you going to put a wig on that deer?
YAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
CONGRATULATIONS GIRL! You deserve this soooo much!!! Cant wait to see all the cool things you do with this place!
Congratulations! I love you 😊🥰
At least she's aware of the creepy people. Unlike the 9 who share everything about them and suddenly wonder why they're being stalked by some pervert, GOOD ON MICARAH!!! Happy women's day sisters
03:55 — That handpuppet thing is sooo cute 😍
Oh im so proud of you!
See, those business cards your mom gave out did pay off 👍
i never thought i'd see this day 😮 congrats on the house!
so pure. so happy for you!
Congratulation Micarah! So happy for you <3
Micarah's videos are the only ones I don't skip the sponsor talk on, cause she makes even that fun to watch.
Oh my gosh how exciting! I agree with everything you said about debt, living with parents, real estate agents etc. I'm in process of buying house right now too!
i feel this on a spiritual level... because i also just bought a house
Congrats!!!!
the only youtube I-bought-a-house video I support
I aspire to be you micarah, thank you for being here. it’s so amazing that u help us and we help u ❤️🥰🥺
I've had a bit of a crappy day but seeing you so genuinely happy and excited made it a little better. Thank you for that, also congratulations on the house 🥳
i’ve never been more happy for a youtubers success :’)
i saw this and i kinda got scared when i did ngl but go off homie
I’m so glad you are so happy with your new house!! Congratulations! 🎊🎉🎈
c o n g r a t s !!!!!!!!
Congrats Micarah!!! So happy for you, such a big step!
Micarah's dad "can I offer you an egg in this trying time?"
"I know i dont deserve this" says the youtuber who literally calms my anxiety, distracts me from my depression and makes me laugh and smile on the worsts of my days, i actually wanna thank you for just being so wonderful and so uniquely yourself, it gives me so much inspiration to just... say fuck you to everything and be me qithout judgement! but still im so glad i found that "recreating ariana grande's dress" video because i been happier ever since! thank u <3
A princess in her new well-deserved castle ❤️❤️.  We love you humble queen!!!!
Garien my baby!
Loved the titanic 💞
I’m not a creepy one
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THE TITANIC SCENE??? IM DYING 😂
I’m so  proud of you I’ve been watching you since you bought the RV just before Covid and you made that video where you were going to dye your hair but you were going to keep the gloves 🧤  😊😱 Super proud of you
i read " i bought a HORSE" and still didnt think anything about it, cause it could be normal for her
This is awesome, ohhhhhhh why am I so excited!?
I AM OBSESSED WITH UR HOUSE!! its so perfect for you!! <3 Congrats love!
You deserve this, Micarah. It is because of your efforts. You may think it is because of our support, but we do because we enjoy what you do. Whatever video you make, you always make it so bizarre and entertaining that we have no option of leaving. We love your personality. We love you. Congrats to your new home! Glad you are happy! ❤
the dislikes are the creepy people who are mad you moved
Your literally so cool
Congratulations Micarah ❤️ this made my day !  ( I’m not crying by the way)
The most wholesome video. Made my day.
You should dye the couch dark green or turquoise! Oh my god your house is so cute! Is do like a Victorian style
Congrats Micarah! You are absolutely most deserving of a house and everything you have received. As someone whose enjoyed your content from the very beginning, I am so proud to see all of the hard work and thought you’ve put into your videos pay off! I’m so excited to see what new ventures are to come! xoxo
As a Brit, I adore how this is a “small” house. Good god
Congrats! It's well deserved!
This was so wholesome! You go girl ❤️
im so excited for the future vids in that house congrats micarah  you deserve it 💖💖💖💖
I have a feeling that the fast talking ad part was not sped up 😭
AHH CONGRATS GIRLYY :D
my iraqi self watching this like: 👁👄👁 12:37
CONGRATULATIONS!!!!
The only YouTuber I am genuinely happy for with their home purchase. You really deserve this!
This made me feel a different kind of joy man. No woman in the world deserves this more than Micarah. Those last few seconds where she’s just genuinely happy made me cry. I love her and I’m so happy to see her thrive.
THAT HOUSE IS SO CUTE WHAT THE FUCK
Micarah is so wholesome and deserving plz stay like this forever🥺🥺I wanna cry cause seeing u happy is testing my eye water bagsssss❤️
“I don’t believe in sidewalks.” Affirmation of the year
I thought she broke into the house
this was so wholesome
Wow! Congrats, girl!   I look forward to random videos of Garion flying around! Lol
Congratulations Micarah!!
Your sponsorship ad was the most entertaining I've ever seen lmao
I KNEW IT
Congratulations!!! ♥️ I’m super happy for you. Please please please make home renovation videos 🙌🏼🙌🏼
I'm jealous, but happy for you.
im so happy for you micarah! <3
You DO deserve this!!! It’s beautiful and so you. Enjoy 💖
The second hand excitement of this video. I'm just sitting here like "she bought a house!!!!!!! She bought a house!!!!!!!!!!!!" About a person I've never met and likely will never meet djskdbkebdkebdk  Enjoy your house!!!!!!!!!!!
Congratulations on your new home! wishing you the best.
Lol they should simply add this video to a house hunters season as an extra 😂
I forgot how funny you were
Congrats!
so so happy for you!
Woop-pee, hooray, hallelujah, amen!  You bought a house!  Congratulations!  I'm soooo happy for you!  ❤️🧡💚❤️🧡💚💜💙❤️
Omg u deserve soooo much❤️❤️
Im so waiting for your personalizarion video
Eeee I can't wait to see more of it!
i’ve been following you since the snap away pants video. and i can’t believe you have gotten this far
I read this as "I bought a horse" and clicked at the speed of light
You totally deserve this and I’m hoping more good things come your way.  Also, install an alarm system to deter would be creeps.  I’m so sorry that’s happened to you.
Congratulations on your house! :)) I hope to become as fortunate as yourself one day but living in one of the most expensive cities in North America...probably not lol. Enjoy it to the fullest! More videos of mr birdie please! :)
Congratulations!! That’s so exciting! That whole titanic scene was priceless 😂😂😂😂
bro this video is so pure
Are you secretly a cat? Because mine does that thing with the patches of sun. Just asking.
i am like so happy for you uwu
i'm so glad to see you so happy!! congratulations!!
be honest. you bought a house so you can have more room to put stuff in.
The Glamnetic sponsorship, mere 2 days after I just about HAD IT with  my cheap magnetic liner must be some divine intervention.     Long story short, I am now awaiting my lashes & liner while having proxy excitement about  the cutest house I've (never actually if you think about it) seen
how rude to say you dont deserve it! of course you do! you deserve the best : )
Well I've been hanging out with you for a few years now and you've brought me so many laughs and happy moments.  And I'm tellin' ya, if there's anyone that deserves a happy happy home, it's you!  Congratulations on your new home!!  I remember buying my first house all by myself all for me and I totally remember being the same way about it that you are.  Enjoy it and I know we all can't wait for house updates!  YAY!!
i must say, that is one beautiful sofa
It's a gorgeous house! Can't wait to see what you do to the parts that need some love. 😍
Awww I'm happy for you!! That's awesome!!! Congratulations!!!
PRETENDS TO BE SHOCKEEEDDD
You are the best
Congratz!
Amazing :)
Oh and congratulations 🥳👏🏼👏🏼💟🐧
"I have never heard of a wholesome "I bought a house" video on this platform they're all narcisitic. They just don't exist-" Micarah: *exists*  "Nvm"
Unlike other creator’s, I actually really enjoy when Micarah has a sponsor, she makes it really fun to watch 😁
Y'all guessed that Micarah bought a house??? I just assumed she broke in.
"I don't believe in side walks. "  FAKING ICONIC 😭👏
I’m really attracted to Old Man Micarah and I’m not ashamed of it 👀
congrats on ur house !! i’m so happy for u <3
This is the best and most joyful video I've seen for years! Endless congratulations!
I can’t wait to see the home decorating videos
Congratulations on your new home!! I recently moved as well and it’s all so exciting! Cant wait to see all that you do to you’re new place!
Congratulations girl!!!
Congratulations Micarahhhh ahhh! 🥰💖
I’m definitely NOT one of your creepy fans, so you should DEFINITELY invite me over
Aww this is so wholesome and you deserves it! Congrats on the new house
You totally deserve this! You're amazing!! 💕 Heh this gives me hope for my own future💕
its great that you got a house but you really really need to be careful filming outside. Honestly even those pictures you took of just the inside could probably be reverse google image searched to find the address. You're a really pretty and nice girl but sometimes other people are not so nice. There are worse things creeps can do besides sliding notes under your door. Please be safe <3
This is the first time I have actually watched through a whole sponsor. Lol
CONGRATULATIONS MICARAH. CONGRATULATIONS!!!!
I’m so happy for you 🥺🥺❤️
You lie, you say you don’t deserve it...YOU DO DESERVE IT!!! You make content that brings a smile to so so sooo many faces, you can brighten someone’s day, you’re a special kind of human❤️ You deserve the happiness you bring others and seeing you happy makes me happy! Congrats on the house!😋 I wish you the best❤️
the fact I got happy for her shows she deserves this house
I am not one of the creeps. I promise lol.
Currently watching this from uk. (Tear) This house would be like 3 million in shittiest london suburb. man...
Literally cried happy tears because of how happy she is
oh my goshhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
JOY!
Hiiiii i love your vids
Congrats! You deserve this and so much more! 💕
I got distracted for one sec bc of hOMeWoRk and saw this 4:15 moment out of context, and then repeated it and it still looked out of context, lol
You totally deserve it! Congratulations 💖
CONGRATS ON THE HOUSE! IT'S PERFECT! I'll be anxiously waiting for decor videos!
Congratulations!!!!!
possibly the only sponsor skit to ever be entertaining
Congrats! It is so exciting to find a place you love to call home !
How is it possible that you could fall in love with a house just like a person??Q?!!?! That sounds so much better to me cause your house won't leave you. lol
Thank you no shame in living rent free till your 31 only haters gonna hate on me for not having bills
And this is why she is one of my favourite youtubers
The pure joy and excitement on your face says it all.
I'm so happy for you girllll <3<3<3<3<3
You DO deserve it!! You’re so kind, smart, hardworking and SO deserving. So proud of you!!!
I'm so happy for her 💓
Omg you're so cute, congratulations! ❤ Hope you and your new house the best. Knowing your lovely teste I'm hoping fort a next "House tour".
11:49 micarah… you just showed the outside though????
I'm happy for you! A little jelly but overall happy.
your happiness is so pure it makes me happy
THIS WOMAN IS A WHOLE PICTURE LIKE SHE IS AN ALBUM COVER AND AESTHETIC COME TO LIFE
The fact that I would be soo happy with just a mono lol
Congrats on your new house!!  Have a Wonderful life there!
why am i sobbing
Congratulations on buying a house!!!
Well I don’t know about you about you but cake is my favorite drink too
Girl I am so so so happy for you!!!! My literal dream is to own my own apartment so I'm so happy that you were able to find and achieve your own dream!!💖💖💖💖
I drink cake
How many neighbors are going to question her?? 😂
I am so proud
I can just imagine her saying: “so we have a sewing room here, craft room, Disney room, movie room,” lol 😂 I just love your creative skills like hoowwwwwwwwwwwwww
As soon as I saw the floors I was like ‘PERFECT for roller skating’ so I am very glad you added the clip at the end!!!
Congrats! You do deserve it!
Omg I’m so happy for you 😁😁 I hope we get a house remodeling and tour like with your RV!
THE THUMBNAIL IS AMAZING!!!!!!!!! 😯😁😮😁
Happy for you Micarah... Your house is really nice
Omg no lie I started crying when I saw the title. I am so happy for you Micarah. You deserve the world. Thanks for continuously making me (and my mom) laugh! We are always entertained. Love to you! 😘💕🥰
Loved your video!
CONGRATS!!! You deserve it! I can honestly say you've made me laugh atleast 10x per video and if you multiply that by all of your vids.....that's gotta be the price of a house, right? (Adjust for inflation) Keep being yourself and doing w/e you frickin want, I'll keep watching! Haha
CONGRATULATIONS
What will Micarah buy next? Find out on next week's episode of Tewers The Sewer.
Finally a lash that kryptonite-free.
I had the same feeling when I bought my house! My realtor and I were standing in the kitchen and I said "This is home. Gimme the papers!" And she said "don't you want to see the bedrooms and the rest of it?" A mere formality--when you know, YOU KNOW. Congrats Micarah! Welcome home 🥰
I like how your stairs are similar to your family homes
Ya know, I'm not even that jealous of you and your house. Because yes, you deserve it!
Ily
<3
I'm sooooo happy for you!!! <3
Did she rlly just cure my fear of clowns by saying exactly what they are
Congrats! Your reaction was exactly the same as mine this morning when I got an email offer about a studio apartment i had my eyes on. The lease is within my price range, the placement is perfect and the community in the house is going to be awesome!!! 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Am I the only one that thought she was holding a mouse?
as a language nerd that first joke was on point!
Omg you advertisement never got me bored😂
I know that habitat for humanity. LOL. Congratulations. It's beautiful. (btw, not a creepy viewer. I just happen to have been in that store 2 Saturdays ago.)
Micarahs sponsorship ads are so interesting I watch them all the way through
thank you for this perfect quotable "I'm very particular about which laws I break"
I'm so happy for you! Your affirmations and joy gave me so much serotonin and also inspiration to do that for myself!
aw micarah, I'm so sorry about the stalking. that must've been so scary. its happened to too many of my favorite female you tubers :((
IM SO HAPPY FOR YOUUUU!!
I’m so happy for you!!! you deserve this❤️❤️ such a pretty house too
So happy for you! Can't wait for more house videos!
14:00
I cannot wait to see you fill these beautiful living quarters with your sewn masterpieces! Congrats
Congrats! It’s lovely!
the titanic impression killed me 💀 "rose, never let go" "i'm gonna have to let go jack, but these lashes never will"
I can’t wait for the house renovation videos !!!!!!
I swear I’m not one of the creepy ones!
I just bought my first house too and I can totally relate to the excitement!! I’m so happy for you!!!!
If you actually play old time rock and roll it makes the ending pretty good

Congratulations! So happy for you! You deserve it!
I love it how excited she is for her new house omg. That just puts a smile to me face.
Eeeeeek remove the pics of the inside of the house! Out of curiousity I wanted to see if I could find the house on Zillow and it was TOO easy with those photos
Idk why I felt sad seeing the title of this video. Like I’m happy for her but also Micarah’s growing up 🥺😪🤧
Is everyone having a Titanic thing right now??
Congrats on your new home!! 🥰
I drink cake
Congratulations 🎉👏 Can I be at the tea party?☕

Barbie's house is always pretty just like Barbie. Happy new home. Micarah deserves all the happiness❤️ 🏡❤️
Love your handy costars on glamnetic
she is so funnnny
SOOOOOOOO DESRVING!!!!!!
OMG!!! It's soooo PRETTY!
The Only and I mean ONLY YouTubers I will not skip a sponsor for because she makes it so funny I wonder why I’m watching it in the first place.
congraaats sending love and peace
I can't express how much I want to be her friend, make her wear a huge Victorian style gown and do a full day of photoshooting around that house     Oh wait I guess I just did express it   Hurray me
I’m excited to see the interior design videos!
ur the cutest ever
Congratulations on your new house! You DO deserve this house and all the best in life!
OMG
Congratulations!  You are drop dead gorgeous and you have a funny squirrelly little voice that I can't get enough of.  And you got a house!
ok now i'm kinda jealous because that house looks actually fantastic
I freaking love how happy you are about the house and I aspire to love my future house/apartment this much too
This is very touching but her daily affirmation of "I don't believe in sidewalks" took me out it was expected
13:42 could be an album cover. Do you sing? You should sing.
omg really you bought a house
YES YES YESS YOU DESERVE THIS!!!  I'm so happy for you deaaar!
Congrats Micarah, when u said that u didn't think that u deserved it I was like, gurl, u put up with the embarassment of walking around ur old neighborhood in extremely gorgeous, but over the top gowns and have to suffer thru the pain of making them. U deserve this SO much. I'm so happy for u. Oh, say hi to ur little half person for me. Haha
I don't know how to express how happy and proud I am, i literally want to cry because she truly deserves this. I'm just happy. congratulations
I would love to vist you that would be dream btw im and not creepy😄 love you micarah your amazing❤
That video just made me smile through out. So happy for you! 🥰
This made me happy :)
Girl you definitely deserve it! You've put in the work and earned your success. The amount of joy you bring to people is way more valuable than you think. Can't wait to see you transform the place :)
Seems like you got a new camera and lighting too, I was wondering why you looked extra beautiful!
seeing your excitement is so cute 😭
Awe, Congratulations!!!
So weird to say that going into debt is an irrational fear😅 It's normal!! Why would any sane person buy a house on credit ?! Also the bathroom thing...it's normal to only have one bathroom ? Like why would you need more😅 I mean I appreciate a double sink but a whole other bathroom seems just excessive if you're not sharing a mansion with 20 people or something 🤔  Also: safety !! Hope you don't get creepy visitors 🙏🏽
Aw look at our girl, all grown up🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
❤️❤️❤️
Micarahs sponsored ads are the only ones on youtube I genuinely sit through because they're just as interesting as the rest of her videos 😂
"Most people don't want a house with only one bathroom" that's such an American thing
I thought it said "I BOUGHT A HORSE" and I didn't question it, I just thought: typical Micarah
Im legit so happy for you i cri
girl I watched your videos a year ago, it's crazy how far you've come since then, And you were always so beautiful!! But baby girl you need 2 bathrooms for guests, or when someone moves in with you...lol 1 bathroom is super inconvenient when you're having family over or an event and more than 1 person needs the toilet lol..And lastly, "I don't believed in sidewalks" 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This is soo wholesome! Congrats
I’m so happy for you ❤️
your new house is literally dream like. especially that light blue room 💙 congratulations!!
I will always love your creativity with your sponsor spot. Also you have brought sooo much humor to the internet you definitely deserve this
OHHH MYYY GOODDDDDD
If one day I go to USA I want to meet you
What a blessing Micarah
oh, to be a young woman buying a beautiful house just to yourself.... amazing
congratulations!!! now, what are you going to call it?
“I’ve never gone to two bathrooms at the same time”😂
Guys, don't be afraid of debt! Be afraid of *irresponsible* debt. Two totally different things. Most of us need debt to build a credit history to live life.
I’m so happy for you!! I can’t wait to see all the fun things you do with the house!
i drink cake
You deserve this so much!?!?!💛💛💛💛
petition for micarah to direct every youtube add from now on
Oh great! Now you can ask Grandpa JJ to marry you and you guys can life happily ever after ❤️
Congratulations! It looks lovely and I hope you are very happy in it, you deserve it. It's good to see someting nice happening for good people. Especially as you bring great joy to many. Never loose that happy glow. Looking forward to your Home Improvement series :D
Love this for you!!! <3
you totally deserve it!!!
Can’t believe people would dislike such a great video
I love that when you call his name Garrion comes all excitedly to you I LVOE YOU BOTH
affirmed that there are no sidewalks on bleep street
Girl I'm so happy for u my cheeks are hurting💕
i’m sorry you put costumes on WHAT??
Congratulations!
That house is so so cute! I think I'd get a similar house if I had the money. I love the living room with those columns/half walls, the glass door, the L shaped stairs... it's so quirky and fun.
Congratulations!!!  I'm so happy for you!
I dunno Micarah, a house WITHOUT wheels seems like a downgrade
How is she able to do her eyeliner like that?????
I'm okay with clowns but balloons give me anxiety 🤣
I just wanna know where you bought that couch for $40????😭😍👌
Congratulations!!!  My husband and I start looking for a house again in June (we were out bid for my dream house last month, and have to start over again, but I needed a few months off cuz it was stressful).  When we get a house I'm going to plant a pecan tree, I don't like pecans but when I was little that's what I thought owning a house was, owning a pecan tree.  Can't wait to see your sewing room!
At the end of the Valentine’s Day video I... uh... well, I just though you broke into someone’s house...
i read the title as horse and just accepted it and was like alright time to see a horse micarahs bought
so happy for you!!! i love those colums
Congrats girl, you deserve all the best ❤️
as a closing agent and someone working towards purchasing my first home I can understand your excitement and hope you had a risky business housewarming dance party!!
I'm so happy for you this is honestly such a heartwarming video. Congratulations on the wonderful home you now own and im. Looking forwards to seeing all the wonderful shenanigans and experimentation you are going to do to it! ( and I'm all I'm for the Regency era ball! ⚽💃)
I know so many people moving to the Buckeye State (from CA)
congratulations !!! stay safe
YOU DESERVE THIS MICARAH
im sry u didnt feel safe at ur dads house :(
wait wait wait. I live in ohio. I have toured so many houses. I've always filmed each one. I always asked the person giving me the tour if I could film it to watch it later. They always said YES. I live in ohio. I am confused why youre saying its against the law.
OH I WANT THAT PKAY AREA
frugal taurus legend
Bruh tell my why her letter made me cry hahaha
Omg congrats! Looking forward to that house make over xD
Name a better person, just in general.  Spoiler: *you can’t*
Wow!!! Congratulations!!! (Also, I'm not one of the creepy people who follow you. At least I don't think so)
CONGRATULATIONS
The patches of sunlight beckon me as well. 😌
only sponsorship i sat through
I'm so excited for you! Your home looks like it was built just for you to play and restore/decorate it to its future glory ❤️. Happy house-warming!
I am no surprised she bought a house! I love it!!! ❤️
just imagining the Edwardian ghosts in this house going from "what on earth is happening?" to "ok, we like her"
CONGRATULATIONS 👏👏👏 IM SO PROUD FOR YOU.😝😝😝😝☺
My parents: your not allowed to live in our house over 18 unless you go to college and pay rent
AAA I knew it!! Im so excited for you!!
"I don't believe in sidewalks" would be my senior quote if I lived in the US
So happy for you !!!!!
I strongly believe you do deserve this. You are my favourite YouTuber and if the internet had more people like you the world would be a better place. I am always excited every time you post and honestly strive to be like you, congratulations Micarah, you earned it❤️
this is SO COOL
But I will tell you keep Florida on the back burner. I know that the Lord is calling people of His to go there.  In my own life the enemy has made sure to make it so I hate Florida. At one point I stated “I would never moved to Florida”! But a couple years ago the Lord placed upon my heart that He wanted me to go to Florida!!! I wasn’t saved when I said I would never go to Florida. Then I got saved and now I’m going to Florida😂  Be careful trying to give out tricky Bible teachings. It doesn’t matter what somebody believes in. It matters what’s in the Bible and what you believe in. I’m just telling you this because I have been watching true Christians crash and burn lately. For doing things like tricky Bible teachings. I would’ve emailed you but I’m afraid you would’ve never got to it. I would’ve come to your house and warned you in person. But I can’t find you now because I don’t know what your house looks like! I knew if I made a comment Grandpa JJ would see it and tell you all about it!
Micarah being so happy at the end and saying how grateful she was made me cry.
also congrats on the house!
Just clicked again to say I saw the thumbnail and I feel genuinely happy for you! Hope it brings you loads of happiness. Sorry about the creepy people.
bro if i was your dad i'd be proud to have you as a daughter just off personality alone. like everyday i'd hear one of your zingers and sip my coffee peacefully thinking, that's my kid!
Dude I love your videos so so much. They make me so happy:) Thank youuuuu
you absolutely deserve this house don’t let ANYONE tell you otherwise
“I know I don’t deserve this” michara you deserve this more than anyone. You make so many people happy, thank you so much for the smiles. Enjoy your house! :)
yes good
This is so wholesome ❤
This is cute and I am so happyyyyyy!!
Based on the amount of joy you brought me, one out of the literal thousands of people who have watched and will watch this video, I think you totally deserve the house
Oh girl, I feel you.  I looked at SOOO many houses before I found my house.  I was losing hope.  Then I found my home!  You know when you find it.  I have no regrets.
i’m sorry- the video is so fun and i literally love her but we need to address how people literally stalked her like that’s not okay :< so- i hope you’re safe <333
Love You girl. You deserve this. You always worked so hard on your videos!
Congratulations!!
I'm not the only one with a zillow addiction?? Phewwwwww
This makes me very happy
tell me why i thought the title was “i bought a horse” and i was like yup sounds normal for micarah
YES! QUEEN! YOU! DESERVE! HAPPINESS!!!!!
this is soooo adorable omg
I don’t even mind the adds as now I can help fund your mortgage. Welcome to home ownership!
Congratulations

Seeing you so happy makes me so happy. We love you, Micarah! ♥️
IM SO EXCITED FOR ALL THE HOUSE MAKEOVER VIDS
A 14 minute vídeo, talking about nails and lashes for 5 minutes in a vídeo about a house. Ok ahahaha
Now 2 of my favorite YouTuber just got a house!! I'm so excited for you. I miss my house so much (in anothrr country in a smaller apartment atm)
So I'm not the only person terrified of debt
I can't wait for royal ball videos like the ones in Little Women or Pride and Prejudice
Micarah: The demon barber of bleep street
Girl, you totally deserved it. You worked so hard on this channel! I can see that you are going to be big one day; You'll make banks and be able to afford any house you want, but nothing will match the excitement, joy and gratitude you experienced with this house.
Perhaps more room means a friend for bird ehhhh?? (a second bird)
I legit teared up when you were expressing how happy your house makes you. 💕 up until just now I had forgotten what true uninterrupted happiness looked like. I'm happy for you and can't wait for the first house renovation video 😁😁
I apologise is this real
Dang your house yells fantasy and I'm here for it ✨
What the heck
Omg! Congrats! You so so so so deserve it! Its gorgeous
I'm so happy for you! You bring so much joy to people and appear as such a beautiful person. You were shown amazing places, it's great you found your home. Can't wait to learn about you and Gereon's next shenanigans and maybe see some decorating.
Congratulations thats a dream come true
Now this is a good Monday
this is one of the only times I’ve ever watched a sponsored part of a vid ngl
🌙So happy for you! It looks lovely!  Thankyou for all the joy and laughter you give to your subscribers 🌾💙
glad to know someone else loves house-hunting as much as me. Have 5 apartment tours in a few weeks that I've been looking at for a few years
OK WAIT   everyone just stop and appreciate micarah's email  that thing was a gorgeous work of art  ok that's it keep scrolling
Wow awesome! You look so incredibly happy and your smile is contagious!
Most youtubers: move to LA or NYC Micarah: moves to a pretty old house in her hometown near her family  That's just so incredibly adorable (and more sensible than moving to LA or NYC (not already living there) on a youtuber's unstable income).
OMG, I'm so happy for you!! Congratulations on your new home!!! xoxo ❤❤❤
congratulations ~ and you are welcome hehe and HEY CREEPS LEAVE HER ALONE!!!
YAY I'm so thrilled for you! I just bought my first house too and it's such an amazing feeling. Doing things up, making it mine!  I can't wait to watch your future videos about house things :) Congratulations <3
The way she says “I have a house” at the end made me actually tear up with happiness for her ❤️ Micarah you absolutely do deserve it
Oh, im so happy for you!💗💗  I hope that in it you can form wonderful and beautiful memories. God bless you!
Ahw congratulations, I’m sooo happy for you and so curious what you are gonna do with all the rooms! Maybe make a forest in one
Love it!!!!!!

It is a problem that so many youtubers are getting stalked, it happened to Bestdressed too and you both had to MOVE.
your genuine joy brings me joy, im so happy for you, EEKKK!!!
I'm so proud of you.
Originally I was gonna post "you can invite me! I promise I'm not one of the crazy ones!", but then realized that's exactly what a dangerous and potentially deranged individual would say, so............ Congratulations on your first house!!!
Best ad I have ever seen.
Omg I'm so happy for you! Congrats🎉
✨𝓘 𝓭𝓸𝓷’𝓽 𝓫𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮𝓿𝓮 𝓲𝓷 𝓼𝓲𝓭𝓮𝔀𝓪𝓵𝓴𝓼.✨

I’m so glad she got Gareon.
So happy for you!!! 😍 😬 😆 Congrats!!!! You made me cry of happiness and now I want a house too 😭🤣😆😉
Congratulations! Very happy for you 😊
I am so stinking happy for you!! Not that your stinky, I saw you take a bath; i mean i saw you in the bath; i meant i saw you eating ice cream :/  I live in Ohio as well, dayton that is , at bleep address. I am not creepy. I just creep along the... hallway... in my house. I have a house too. I also have a husband and a girl and a boy!! Maybe one day you will too!!! if you want to, that is... Am i done yet? do you know?......
My Mom grew up in a house with 10 siblings, 2 parents, and one bathroom. She yells at the people on HGTV who insist that they can't live with one bathroom. Especially if it is a couple with no kids. Mom said to say "CONGRATS" and she loves your house. Also, stay safe.
Congratulations!! You deserve it!
Yay I’m so happy for you!!!
Micarah is the only person able to make me want to watch her talk about her sponsor and not skip it
this video gave me so much serotonin, so happy for you!!!!
She's so happy and oh my god I am so happy for you. Seeing people happy makes me so happy and I think I'm crying now. I love you, I hope everything gets to be as happy as Micarah one day😭❤️
I’m so happy for you
this is great!
Micarah will always be the only one on this whole Earth that makes me watch a full sponsor that lasts more than a minute without wanting to skip it. Btw she's not a princess, she is a QUEEN.
Congrats!!!
You know how you have the one YouTuber you watch all the time? When you see an upload you just get comfy and enjoy the ride. Yeah that youtuber uploaded but then i seen Micarah uploaded and i immediately skipped original favorite to watch her video.
you deserve this so much and you have worked so hard for this so go you Micarah <3
Congratulations 🎊🎉
Honestly didn’t question the fact you had a vacant house to film in. Didn’t even blink. It’s just something you would do 😂
She really is so very tall. Either that or every single doorway in her house is very short. Also I have never figured out why she bought a second rv. Can someone please explain to me why. Seriously.   Congrats Micarah!
Watching how excited you were about this house made me genuinely excited as well
Wow. So happy for you! I thought the rvs were you living our dreams but rvs and an old timey house you can make your own that you own-own. Wow. Goals. Really happy for you. Can't wait for all tbe crazy remodell vids
Congrats on getting your won house! Be cautious and don't film to much (directly) outside  of it or else some unwanted creeps are gonna apper. 😘 Have fun decorating ~🎄🎃🧸
The neighbors will love ya
So proud and happy for you Micarah!
Micarah talking about how she’s only one person... then she proceeds to clones herself.
im really happy you found a house you like, also don't worry i also low key have a fear of debt,,
Kinda want the frame at 4:29 as a poster lol Also I'm sorry you had to deal with stalking, that's really awful :( sending love
So happy for you!!!!
I can’t tell you how happy I am for you!!!! And Zillow is so hecking addictive and I’m in high school.
Congrats
This is so cute!
omg bestie so excited for you bestie!!!
Didn’t watch you for a while and forgot how much I love you😂❤️
I am soooo happy for you 🤗🤧 Welcome HOME 🏡
YAYYY YOU DID IT and I love your vids it inspired me to make a dress SO YAY
You absolutely do deserve it because you WORKED for it. Super happy that you are happy <3
I was actually just thinking about you the other day, when I rewatched some of bestdressed videos and I got to the one where she gave an apartment tour because she was moving AGAIN after some creep found her apartment and tried to break in or something. And I thought about how often you post outside your house and hoped that hadn't happened to you but of course it did. God, people like that disgust me, but I am glad you found a new place!! And you seem so excited!! And it really made me giddy with excitement too!!! But ALSO you DO DESERVE this Micarah!! You work hard, you are your amazing self, and that is why this opportunity presented itself to you. I'm so proud of you for being able to buy this house!
this was so precious :)) CONGRATS MICARAH WERE SO PROUD OF YOU!!
You deserve the world
Alright so congratulations on the new house but I have a suggestion for a dress could you please make one of Charlotte La Bouff’s dresses from princess in the frog specifically her dress from the party she threw for prince naveen or the dress she wore for her parade wedding
This... this is what makes me smile so much!! Seeing someone genuinely entertaining and so original succeed! You go girl!!!  Been following since the beginning however I am confident I still cannot make any wearable peace of clothing 🤣.  All love from Latvia and the Netherlands. <3
Does anybody else want micarah to be your best friend
🧡
This made me so happy congrats 🎉
The first time i rented my own apartment i felt similar joy, i can't wait to experience it on a bigger level, you deserve it <3
That house suits her so well😁 i can't wait to see what she does with it😍
yet another ad of yours I watched because it was just so well done n funny. Also sorry about those creeps :( must be scary, fuck those guys.
Ooohhh. Nice. I’m so glad you got a house.
your house is so beautiful!!
Omg your house is so pretty !!!!!
I love your videos! :)
Best wishes for the new house can't wait to see how you make it your own.  Wish you lived next door door to me so we could craft together lol
want some eggs
Why am I not roller skating in my own home? Lol
Congrats!
Ok I feel like everyone has J walked AT LEAST once
I am beyond jealous. .That is TOTALLY the kind of house I want to get in a year or 2.
Absolute queen..... you literally have the life I want for myself in five years. I look forward to what chaos you'll wreak now that you have a whole property to yourself. Also, house remodeling video? :0
Congrats!
Congratulations !!!!
micarah makes me so HAPPY
Congratulations on your new home!  I hope you turn it into your own wonderland! I hope you occasionally share the fun things you do with it!  Furthermore, I'm so sorry that people are harassing you with creepy notes.  No one should have to put up with that and I sincerely hope it stops now that you've moved.
Micarah: I am a responsible adult that bought a house Also Micarah: I don’t believe in sidewalks
our dads have the exact same name
did I just watch a basically 6-minute long ad for lashes and enjoy it? yes. *yes I did.*
CSo is your fear of clowns" Ooooouch feeling called out...
micarah is one of the rare ones on internet that has the looks, AND personality AND talent , I'm impressed
When you cut it off I thought you were making a joke about breaking into someone's house 😳
You know when she talked about doing a happy stretch and then breaking your ceiling, I have also done that. It's the problem with drop-down ceilings.  Happy stretches are not a good idea
I’m from Iraq
My dad also aggressively offers to make me scrambled eggs and now that I'm in college, I definitely miss it
I’m so happy for you! Finally getting the house to settle down in and calling your own must be the best feeling ever:
Living in a shack would be cool
i ate a frog today 😀 😃 😄 😁😜 🤪 🤨 🧐 🤓 😎
CONGRATS MICARAH!!!!!! Well deserved. Now please tell us about all the ghosts - what their names are, when they died, how many siblings etc....thanks in advance!
I love how Gerrion flew right up to you, what a precious baby <3 And now he's got big ceilings
Yayyyy
CONGRATS!!! It's gorgeous !❤️🌼 I burst into tears with my house too 😭🤣🌸
Yes you deserve this!
Periodt!
this is the cutest thing ever- congratulations!
“I know I don’t deserve this” says the most deserving girl this side of the Mississippi. Or that side of the Mississippi, I’m not sure where she’s standing in respect to my current location. We might be on different sides of the Mississippi. But still deserving none the less. I hope I get inspiration from her paint choices since I haven’t settled on any myself in my 3 plus years of home homeownership 😅
Im happy for youuu!!! 🤗
her neighbors are  going to be like , "looks like the girl next door is doing that sun chasing thing again! i wonder what she'll do tomorrow!"
it's such a cute house, i love it! i'm so happy for you!!
Now that is a lovely house 😍
leave micarah in peace. stalking isn’t ok whatsoever. shame on you.
You are literally, NOT figuratively, the only social media whose ads I watch. I relaunch games when the ads happen. You're just so durned funny!!!
AWHHH SEEING MICARAH HAPPY MAKES ME HAPPY
I have a feeling that they’ll be many, many decorating videos
I got a mortgage ad in the middle of her process of going home   I might've internally laughed-
oh, I cant wait to see what you do with it. Enjoy it have fun girl, you deserve it
Girl i literally joined the army to avoid my school debt 😔😔😔 like i would rather die than go in debt.
come on- we all knew she would get this house someday
Why do you speed up your videos?
So happy for you!
This is probably my favorite YouTuber home reveal
I smiled SO much when I saw the title
Congratulations so happy for you that you found your dream house and you are so sweet and hardworking you absolutely deserve it
If anyone deserves a house, its her.
Im so happy for you! You make me want to buy a house😂
You’re the only youtuber that gets me to watch the sponsored section of ur video
I watched a true crime documentary the other day and it said the music was composed by Micha Tewers, I about lost my mind. It has to be the same family right?  Congrats on the house!
OML FINALLY
I just love Macarah and her energie she's sooo precious . If you see this this comment I love youuuuu 💕💕💖💖💞😌😌🌼
Congrats!
The only youtuber bit for an advert ive ever not skipped lmao

.......
"I don't believe in sidewalks" LMAO when I tell you I shrieked
OMG I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU ! YOU TOTALLY DESERVE IT GIRL
YESSSSS MICARAHHHHHH!!!!!!   You *DO* deserve this! Enjoy your lovely new home <3
Congrats!!! YOU DESERVE A HOUSE! <3 <3
Jajajajajajajaj 🤣
I can tell you right now, whatever they are paying you to promote their stuff, it so NOT ENOUGH! Before you came along I had never actually WANTED to watch an advertisement. You are adorable.. (P.S. I am not one of the creepy ones)
So happy for you! Working hard pays off! Enjoy your new home!!!!
I am so happy you are happy, and you do deserve the house!
So genuinely happy for you😍
wait this made me so happy?
Oh my goodness Micarah! I totally thought you bought it! I am so exited! I literally screamed. I am not kidding. I am so happy!
I'm literally so happy for you. I've been watching your videos for so long and I love seeing how happy you are ❤ your story is also helping me feel a lot better about my journey so far since I have gotten some backlash for still living with my parents and planning to do vanlife/rv life for a bit in order to travel and save for a house. Thank you for being my favorite youtuber ❤
micarah i am SO HAPPY FOR YOU. you look so genuinely happy and u dont know how happy that made me too. i promise, you deserve that house !!! we love you micarah <3333
Can I come to your tea party
This video gave me so much second-hand happiness! Also I love the funky nook with the TV in the kitchen
I literally was on the checkout on glamnetic before I realized I’m moving in a week and don’t know my new address yet lol
Nobody is gonna talk about  the fact that she made this video exactly 14:00 mins long?
So usually I skip the promotions in videos but  I took a chance  Now I want this stuff Dang it
i’m pretty bitter when ppl succeed but i’m happy for u🤌😍
Aww Micarah I am so happy that you got your own house to do all your fun shenanigans in!!! Hope you love your house and have an amazing time in it!!!!❤️
And can u do a tour?????
Currently in university with three kids in a bachelor apartment. Not lying. I’m jealous a bit. But not envious. This is goals! Good for her!!!!!
Yay I’m so proud Micarah
Omg... the house???? It’s such a pretty home for uu
Ok I have a great video idea! You could make a bee dress! That would be cool to me.
Congrats girl!
U do deserve it
NEED A ROOMATE?
Me: it’s late, I should go to bed _Micarah uploads_ Me: Sleep is for the weak.
IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU!!!!!
MICARAHHHH IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU!!!!!!
Just found out she’s an entp AND IT MAKES SO MUCH SENSE
Nobody:  The little girl next door when she finds out Micarah moved in:  *OMG BARBIE MOVED IN NEXT DOOR*
don't deserve this? Nah, you make awesome content and you work your ass off. you definitely deserve this!!!
YAY SHE POSTED! THE QUEEN IS BACK
There’s no one else on YouTube who deserves this house as much as you, honestly. Youre far too sweet, creative and entertaining.
hi i’m not creepy and i live in ohio and i wanna have victorian style tea parties a you 🥺 we could be bffs
I usually skip when people sponsor stuff but I enjoyed watching you sponsor the lashes lol
Congratulations young lady.🥤🍳 🥤the soda because you don't drink alcohol...  🍳 and the eggs .......................  Welllllllll   those are from your dad.. lol
Now that’s a nice house with character. Renovating this will be fun.
neighbors: why is there a duck on her porch.
Seeing her this happy makes me so happy and I hope someday I can be this happy :)
you DO deserve a house! You've worked hard for it!!
Noooo you’re fueling my zillow addition 🤣 in all seriousness this house is gorgeous congrats
The glamnetic promotion was my favorite part of the video 🤣🤣🤣 10/10 and I agree I never want to have a mortgage ever in my life. Even on campus housing or rent in my state is so expensive that I the moment I step foot outside my bank account would be dry for years. 🤣🤣🤣
I think that's the first time I've happily sat through an entire promotion and actually enjoyed it
lowkey would die for micarah
You deserve it!
YAYAYAY I GOT SO HAPPY THAT YOU POSTED!
I'm buying the product just because of how wonderful you promoted it
Im so happy seeing you this happy! Not in a creepy way, belive me im not one of those. Gareon knows me
Oh Michael Williams!!!! I'm so happy for you. Congratulations! 🎉🎉🎉 You DO deserve it. Can't wait to see your renovation updates. P.S. Your offer letter was perfect. I hope you didn't change anything.
The only commercials I actually watch.
congratulations ♥
Only she can make the sponsored part of a video entraining 🤣
So were not gonna talk abouy how she dont believe in sidewalks?🧐😆
IM HAPPY YOU’RE HAPPY !! 🥺🥺
Congrats my dude!!!
This was awesome I am so happy for you!!!
Did anyone notice that this video is also 14:00 minutes long XD XD XD
Grats!!
Congratulations!
Congrats! I'm excited for you and you don't even know me. But you've made my 2020 brighter. Please enjoy your home!
Best advertising ever, I thought I will never say that 😅
When you have regency tea parties please invite me thank you also congrats on buying a house <3
Congratulations!!!
Omg I’m so happy for you heheheh now your chickens will invade the neighborhood hehheheheh😈😈
Your not kidding right!!!!! Now you can fit all of your outfits you made!!!!

OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!ITS SO PRETTYYyYyY
This is so cuteeee
Are you kidding me? You deserve this! I am honestly SO incredibly happy and thrilled for you, and proud of you to vintage boot. I am SO excited to see how your renovations go. just plz for the love of hilary duff plz plz don't use contact paper as wallpaper in the bathroom again. ALSO DANG THAT ALUMINIUM TILE BACKSPLASH IN THE KITCHEN.
Congratulations! This is gonna be fun. So many rooms. So many opportunities for weirdness.
Aww.  So happy for you!
Don’t worry Micarah, I don’t believe in sidewalks, either.
Send as much redecorating and home renovation footage to us youtubers as you can! I LOVE seeing homes redecorated.
I AM SO PROUD OF U AND U KOOK SO HAPPY MWAH <33
Oh my god! I literally screamed of joy when i saw the title of this video!  The only dream i have is to own my own home, and i am so incredibly happy for you!!
But what about your chickens? They ever coming to visit?
Congratulations Micarah! The house is sooo pretty
You truly deserve it queen🖤
actually so happy for you!
Congrats🖤🖤🖤🖤
Congratulations.
OMG CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!! I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU!!!!!🥳🥳🥳🥳
I'm very proud of you as a young person making your way.   I learned from a very wise woman that children need more supervision, not less, as they age.  For one thing the results of their mistakes can be permanent at that point.  Young adulthood is just a very hard road without a lot of support and guidance.  I think you have chosen the best way for you and it is a good one.  Okay rant time:  If you put your shoes on that white couch ONE MORE TIME!!!!!!! lol
If she ever dose host tea parties I hope she invited me! I'm English!!! Also Beautiful house Love!!!
Can you make Disney Katrina Van Tassel drees PLEASE!!!🥺
ah, so the zillow tidbit was definitely foreshadowing.
I'm so happy for you!
the amount of pure joy in this video is so wholesome
this was honestly so wholesome yet hilarious yet exciting yet chaotic yet fabulous yet heartwarming
That was the cutest shit ever
We're all so happy for you!
Hey micarah!!!! I found your channel a little while ago when I was going through a small crisis where I could only see on b&w and you helped me through it I want to thank you for it!
Entertainment at its finest
Hey I really really appreciate that bit about how you shouldn't be ashamed of living with your parents. My partner and I really want to live together, but we're being smart and waiting until we can afford it to make that leap. So, we both still live with our parents. We're both happy and our parents are happy, but other people like to judge, so that was a nice little reminder. Thanks <3
I will only sit through an ad if it's done by Micarah
That final fall onto the couch cushions is so heartwarming you look so happy
You do deserve it though! You seriously branded yourself, and I love to check in for (semi) informational sewing tutorials, but mostly hilarity. You have shown me as someone who sews that there is a lot of room for error, dont sweat the small stuff. If supporting you is as easy as clicking subscribe and watching ads, then I'm in. Thank you for being yourself!
My parents are getting divorced are your videos are the only thing getting me through this and I just want to say thank you so much for making videos. ❤️
EEEEKKKKK
IM LIVING VICARIOUSLY THROUGH YOU I LOVE YOU
Damn if you start making renovation videos this channel is going to be the absolute best thing on the internet. Can't wait!
I love your house its so beautiful and i share your enthusiasm and excitement 😊. (Btw im 12 and your my inspiration ❤)
Micarah, your excitement for your house is so wholesome and cute! I am so happy for you!!! <3
Your debt fear is relatable
I swear shes the ONLY youtuber i enjoy watching the sponsorship
Congratulations I’m sooooo happy for you
who ever dislikes this video is a jealous puppy hater.
Oooooo I love your house❤️
I want your house
:,)
You’re so funny bro. I love you, never change ❤️
You're Welcome. :)
Good for you :)
This video is making me excited to be an adult
Think I just fell inlove with Micarah all over again. So cute and excited in this video. Can’t wait to see what she does with all the space she has now
This made me feel so good🥺 I'm 19 and I already feel the pressure of moving out from other people
10:32 did anyone else think of Steve Harrington?         sorry i have watched stranger things way too many times
MICARAH GIRL IM SO PROUD OF YOU
I’m so happy for you!😃😃  You made my day bright! You always make me laugh
This was so wholesome. From your gratitude for your channel to your only complaint about your dad making you too much food lol. You deserve this!
actual tears rolled down my cheeks because I'm so happy for her 😂
Modern/Contemporary Amelia Bedelia - congrats on the house 🎉🥳🎊

Those patches of sunlight clips just hit different. Ohio life <3
SO HAPPPPYYYYY YAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Why am I literally crying bc I'm so happy for her 😘🥺🥺🥺
You know, I don't think there's a single youtuber or even just content creator whose as genuinely kind and humble as you. Please enjoy your new house and I can't wait to see all the funky DIY home improvements you decide to do. I definitely loved your videos on fixing up your RVs the way you want and making them special and just for you. I can only imagine how crazy amazing you'll get with a static, actual house.
The puns were coming faster than my puny brain can understand help
Gereon's gonna be in awesome free flight condition 10/10 parrot mom
I've been watching you since like video 4 and you have idea how happy this makes me
Guys we are witnessing a historical event
Never been more excited for a house tour,,, I know you’re gonna make it look BEAUTYFUL
She better decorate this as soon as possible.
What are you gonna do with the rvs
I'm so ready for the house makeover video >:D
Congratulations! Owning a house is the dream for so many 35 and under, I'm so happy for you that you found -home-! I hope you have all the happiness possible :D
YOU DO DESERVE THIS YOU DO DESERVE THIS! I’m so proud of you and so happy to come along with you on this new journey!!! ❤️❤️
Is it just me or is my YouTube premium subcuription useless because there’s still promotions and adds no offense to her but I think that YouTube premium should filter all adds and promos out
Omg wished i were ur neighbour ! Ur amazing really watching ur videos  since u started and look where we r now! I feel so happy fr u ! Well deserved congratulations grl!
YOU DESERVE THAT HOUSE, BABY.
This just made my day, thank you- I thought i was missing something and it turned out to be this lol
Congratulations 🎊
IF YOU LOVE YOUR FANS PIN THIS COMMENT  Just kidding ik that kind of stuff is annoying, but i would cry (with tears of joy) if u did Btw i think the thumbnail is beautiful
You do deserve this
Matching your outfit to the curtains!!
Congratulations!!the house is beautiful 😍💕❤
i feel like i'd be a lot like you if i hadn't been traumatized early as a child :')
wait people found ur dad's house... and so u bought ur own... cool!
You're excitement is contagious! I cannot wait to see all the reno videos that you'll do!
you deserve it so muchhh
Ok but she did it she made it 14:00 like amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!
All my life I’ve lived only in rented houses — parents weren’t too well off and we would move about every three-five years. It’s my dream to own a house and live in it. Seeing you so happy is so motivational, because I hope one day when I actually buy my own place, I’ll be at least half as happy as you! 💖🥺
I GASPED when i saw you upload
I’m so genuinely happy for you 🥺
You buying a house and moving out of your dad's house has somehow made me more confident in buying a house
ahh, the ending... I could feel your happiness. Congrats!
I’m so happy for her, her house is so beautiful! I’m so excited for room decor videos
GIRL I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOUUUUUU!!! YOU DESERVE ALL OF THIS! your success is well earned
The house looks awesome! Btw, what kind of bird is that? I kinda want one 🧐
OMG u killed me with Oldness
I love you!!
Yayyyyyy
If the house is old I hope you don’t get ghosts. But you probably don’t have anything to worry about, I bet ghosts would actually like you tbh.
I’m so happy for you! I just started using Zillow myself to look for apartments!
Finally, a new video from this absolute ICON
Aw I’m so happy for you! Congratulations!
So happy for you!!!
That fear of clowns comment hit deep...  but also congrats!
Girl, can I just say what a blessing your videos are? They bring a lot of joy to a lot of people! And each one is like a work of art. You are so talented and have such a wonderful heart. Thanks for letting all of us have a peek into your life and get to feel like friends of yours just for a little while! ❤️☺️
Congratulations!
This is so wholesome
Micarah - lives in a small RV for a while: does just fine! Also Micarah - moves to a big house and stubbs her toe in her spacious kitchen xD
Micarah is literally the definition of funny 😂
This is so sweet 💖
I can't wait to see the decorating videos! I'm sure the insta polls will be epic. If almost makes me wish I was on instagram. Almost.
Congrats on your new place! Glad you and your family are safer now. Sorry for the creeps
MICARAH can you make one of the muse's dresses from hercules 🥺💜
Immensely happy for you 🙏🏾💕
Omg! I’m so excited I can’t wait to see what you’ll do with it! So proud of you girly!!!! ❤️
Are you going to sell one of the RVs now that you have a house?
:0 Congratulations! :D
I love your videos so much! And your house it fits you so well! You could classify it as effulgent :)
The self affirmations got me😂 “I don’t believe in sidewalks...”
Congratulations
She’s literally the only YouTuber I know that can make a sponsor funny and enjoyable to watch 😂
I was literally JUST thinking I needed a new video from you!
Omg I’m so happy for her❤️
Super proud of you micarah. I'm so sorry if you were or are being stalked. I would maybe consider getting a personal protection dog or something if you keep having problems like that. You dont have to buy an offical ppd, I was able to make my pet dog into one. Best of luck and I love you and everything you've accomplished. You're super awesome girl and dont let anybody tell you you're not.
This one just makes me happy. This can’t be good 😌
Genuinely so happy for u Micarah u deserve it! ❤️❤️❤️
Congrats!! It's gorgeous!!! Very very happy for you!!
You do deserve it‼️ Congratulations 🥳🥳
I’m telling y’all, she’s a Princess.
The fact people have actually shown up to your dad's house or even actively looked for his address and found it is just beyond anything we should have to deal with as an actual decent human society.
yes so proud of you !!!!!!!
Congrats!! So happy for you. Mean people who scare people ruin lots of things for regular people.  Nothing will ruin your house for you!  Enjoy!
I’m so happy for you, girl ❤️
Congratulations!!!! 🎉🎈🎊 you do deserve all the joy your lovely new home gives you!
I swear I'm not a weird fan, looking at people on the street makes me nervous because I don't want to come off as a creep
I’m soo happy for you
god i love u
"..and I'm very particular about which laws I break."
I love watching Micarah's ads😂
Have people actually gone to your dads house??? Im so sorry, that's super scary.
You do deserve this Qween!!
We can really tell you love that house so much!!
Honestly I didn't assume she bought a house from her last video.. because I assumed she would have like broken in due to her chaotic nature
Sooooo Happy for you! Congratulations!!! Time to sew some drapes!!!
"I repeat my self affirmations, I dont believe in sidewalks"😂😂😂
So so so excited for you!!!! You absolutely deserve it!!
I’m so happy for you micarah! 🤧💓
Aww I am so happy for her 😊😊
I know Micarah is a goddess but still how quickly she drew the wing line shocked me, yes even more so than the lashes themselves!
Can u ask ur dad to adopt me pls. Thnx
I wasn't planning to click on any videos without music but I saw that Micarah bought a house and was all, "What! Must see!" Also, Congrats!!!!
Well deserved 👏🏻👏🏻 congratulations on your new home 💕✨
The thumbnail looks like a millenial vlog skdjbdhd
this video is so absolutely adorable. it fills me with joy to see you so genuinely happy <3
Congratulations girl 🥰
I am so happy for you wow I’m big jelly
Congratulations!!!! I'm so happy for you! 🎉🏠🎉
Ok I know you said there’s no way that you can tell if I’m creepy or not but if you ever, ya know, want to invite me to one of those tea parties... I highly doubt I would refuse. This is not a hint, it’s just a statement that is irrelevant.
CONGRATULATIONS!!! So happy for you <3
love you micarah! you inspired me to sew a dress for my school dance and i really enjoyed it :) i appreciate u so much!
✨ *s c r a m b l e d e g g s* ✨
you should give garrion a room
I'm so happy for you 😍 Seriously your probably 1 of my favourite youtubers, your so humble, extremely talented, down to earth, relatable, and funny as hell! 💗💗 you deserve all your success and more xxx dont change! And thankyou for always cheering me up xxxx
Creepy ones: you ruined our chances of hanging out with Micarah at her new home, i hope you reflect on your actions and try to understand that pinneaple on pizza is good and yall are just weird af
Congrats 😊 So happy for you 😊
This morning I woke up and couldn't remember which side the sun rises on, then it dawned on me hehehhe
Wow still only 14 minutes
I was about to skip the promo as i usually do with other youtubers but then i remember i am in Micarah's channel so i know its gonna be a good one
This house is so freaking adorable - I would move right in. 😍😍😍  (AND WHAT THE FFFFF WHAT CREEP MADE YOU WORRY ABOUT STAYING AT YOUR DADS!! IM GONNA FIGHT HIM LEAVE HER ALONE!!1!1!! .... okay, good, needed to get that out of my system.... love youuu)
can i cry now :")
so excited for the future episodes of house decorating !!!
IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 IM SO PROUD OF YOU 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 OH MY GOODNESS!!!!!!!!
Zillow can get downright pornographic. Wraparound porch and a master suite? Oooooo
I could see Micarah breaking into the neighbors house and stealing their furniture and making it into a dress and wearing it to a dinner party.
I love you but it made me a bit sad that you don't know anything about
I’m seeing this in school rn and I’m sooo happy for uuuu🤗🤗🤗
Girl let not start on your outfits, YOUR HAIRRRRRRRR.
This is so exciting!! As a fellow Zillow scourer, congrats!!!
I don't have words strong enough to explain what should happen to the people who came to her house and harassed her.
It's been a while since I've been so happy about another person being so happy!!!
She is the one youtuber that I feel personal joy when she buys thing and succeeds in life. I too am so frugal and I'm so happy for her.
Do you guys remember when she made a dress from a bag of chicken feed
Congratulations 🥳  🎉 👏👏❤️👍🙌👌
I’m do happy for you.
Scrambled eggs... I’m always offering them to my father
You're the only youtuber that makes your sponsored ads interesting and I watch them and forget it's a sponsored ad
smartest and most entertaining way to promote the lashes LOL LOL
Ok Micarah, I played Old Time Rock & Roll for the last 37 seconds of the video. Happy times!
7:15 THANK YOU I AM SO GLAD SOMEONE ELSE DOESN’T SEE A MORTGAGE AS SOMETHING FINE!!!! I am also afraid of debt, and I honestly don’t think its irrational. If you have a mortgage on your house, and you can’t pay it for whatever reason, NO MATTER HOW LONG YOU HAVE BEEN PAYING FOR THE BANK WILL TAKE YOUR HOUSE!!! Also some banks give you lower initial interest rates to pull you in, then will jack it up after a few years!!! Also if I were you I’d wait a while to buy a house because there is a good chance we are going to have a house crash soon, so wait til then.
Reads title.      FINALLY!!!
Ok but this was so cute, especially the end when you were smiling. I love seeing people I care about happy.
Is that law about not being able to record at house viewings written down somewhere? I looked for it online, but didn't find anything that said that. It did say that sellers could record video in the homes, but had to get consent before recording audio, nothing about the buyer, though. I'm curious to see what the law actually says.
Congrats on finding a house Micarah!😊💕
I AM SO HAPPY FOR YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Such a BEAUTIFUL home ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
:0
I'm earlyyyyyyy 💃🏾💃🏾😎😁
Glamnetic lashes eh? I’m sold 😂
She should do a moving vlog
This is the cutest video Ive ever seen
im not creepy i promes
Has anyone tried these lashes? They actually seems really awesome. I'm a sucker for things that can be reused
I couldn't stop grinning for the entire video! So happy for you!
Debt is a terrible thing. I live on a boat that is fully paid for, I know what a wonderful feeling it is not having those monthly bills.   Congratulations, you have worked very hard for this. I hope your home brings you many hears of happiness.
Anybody else notice a floating orb at 4:54?
My favorite was the Titanic reenactment scene!!! Also, I would love to visit (only on invitation of course!) so I could serenade and thrill with some Chopin Etudes on your piano!
Congratulations! I'm sew happy for you!
ahhhhhh congratulations :) contrary to what u said u DO deserve this
Awwwwww can’t believe the same goober getting 300 views a video is now a house owner 😭😍 so proud of you

You totally deserve it! Congrats!!!!

I am so happy for you. One day I will be there too
I’m so excited to see how you decorate it :D
i read i bought a horse & was very confused with the key in the thumbnail 😭 congrats 💛
CONGRATULATIONS YOU DESERVE IT
The only influencer that gets me to watch every ad and promotions and make me buy fake lashes and nails, even tho i don't use either
I am so happy for you! Congrats Micarah, you absolutely deserve it! ❤️❤️
Micarah, that living room is PERFECT for running through whilst wearing a massive ball gown!
I’m so happy for you Micarah 🏡 🕊
Can you pleeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaas House tour
This was the single most wholesome video on YouTube
im also in the process of buying my first house at 21. its so stressful and so exciting. my offer was rejected on what i thought was my dream house this morning, and im touring my alt dream house tonight. im really excited to follow along and get inspo from your journey! congrats micarah!! <3
Congratulations on the house.
WOWOWOWOWWWW congratulations that is awesom!!!!!! so coollll
Congrats! I love your videos!!🥳🥰
Yo funny, magnetic, hilarious woman. Send my love to your house.
So glad Micarah isn't stifling her creativity working retail. I can't imagine that.
9:50 THATS BARBIE FROM THE 12 DANCING PRINCESSES NITENDO DS GAME
Congrats!! Where’s the blue top from 💙
You are a unicorn! So funny! Enjoy your new house! 😘😘😘
your house looks so cool ! happy for u :))
wow I need to watch your videos at at least 0.75 speed to understand the whole thing :D ;(
*”i don’t believe in sidewalks”*
Two big things:   1. I am so, so happy for you for getting this house, that's incredible. Your videos have been almost the only thing to actually make me smile for the past year and it's great seeing you shine and be happy and have your own full-sized space!! 2. Thank you for saying that about adult children staying with their parents; I've been in the middle of controversy about it for years (I'm 27 and live at home) and while nothing's going to change re: me getting kicked out I'm always happy when I hear the insanely rare opinion that it's actually fine!
Congratulations on buying a house, Ms. Tewers! It's quite I SENT THE COMMENT BEFORE I TYPED IT OUT WHY AM I LIKE THIS. I meant to say that it's quite unfortunate that there are creeps out there trying to find you.
This video made me so happy !
I feel like she is enjoying all her new options for unexpected jokes in this house XD
You deserve it!
Houses in America are so fucking big ... this would cost so much where I live
Im just so proud 🥲 I’m 25 and still live with my parents but someday in the distant future I will buy my house. I have it narrowed down to 3 choices: one is a beautiful Victorian overlooking some scenic hills, another is an Italianate with some really cool hidden garden paths, another is a standard farmhouse on some forested acreage.  Until then can I just live vicariously through you and all of the old house instas I follow?
i actually played old time rock and roll, it was so worth it)
This woman is smart, funny, beautiful, talented, what else could you possibily need in a friend?
I love her with my whole heart. 😂
Congratulations!! Wishing you all the best in this new chapter!
Im the person that broke in          Jk dont aresst mee
Congratulations
I want to do victorian tea parties too!
This video that made me feel SO HAPPY
Glamnetic should make this an official ad.
I am watching the ads for you and only you
So happy for you. Also such a perfect announcement ahhhhhhh 🥰
You are so beautiful. And now I want to try these lashes lol
Congratulations
Micarah, I have a very serious question for you. Who/what is your muse when it comes to your jokes? I'm dying to know (inside, not out. thank goodness sakes).
Oh my god your promotion ads are so entertaining
This is such awesome news! <3
can i please be invited to the tea party in your new house?
I love this video (I am also house hunting), and I can't wait to see what you do with the house, Micarah! I am so excited and happy for you. :) If I could prove that I wasn't one of the creepy internet people, I would totally be down for a regency tea party. No joke. But in lieu of that, I will just look forward to the youtube video version. Cheers!
If you make another video about your house, you could title it “If Bleep Street Could Talk”   but seriously sooooo happy for you!! You absolutely do deserve this!!! ❤️
I knew it ... you are cinderella! Congrats on the house, legit a little jelly... a house that size would cost near half a mil where I am from. Also you are legit awesome, i love your brain and all it’s wonderful wrinkles :)
I dream of the day when I'll have my own house to decorate however I want and live with all my pets! I'm really happy for you!!
Can’t wait for a new house decorating series!
that ad is the most amazing thing I have ever seen
Do you believe in reincarnation?  No, but they might JSJAAAJSSS omgggg
Congratulations!!! You deserve this for all your hard work and creativity, wish you the best 💕
not you randomly shaming me  for my fear of clowns........, anyway ily
Congratulations!  If anyone deserves to buy their dream house it is you!
Why doesnt glamnetic just have Micarah do all their adds??????????????
I’m so proud
Video no. 4 of me asking Micarah to make one of Scarlette O’Hara’s dresses from Gone With The Wind
Congratulations Micarah! There is very little talk about being frugal in this consumer driven world of ours and always nice to see that it has paid off and you have a house that makes you feel so happy :)
I’m so proud of you ily
Wishing you and your house a long and prosperous marriage
hey I'm not the creepy one me here 👉🏽💃🏽 but i am the on that doesn't live near you so can't visit
Micarah, I promise I'm not one of the creepy ones!
AND I AM LATE 5 HOURS NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
for real i started watching u in y12 and i was depressed as all hall and your strangely appealing prom dress video strode across the bleak city of youtube up to my office, and i just had to say yes. the journey you and i have taken individually has been immaculate, from my depressed state to a fully realised human being doing a degree in the arts with friends and life, to your journey from singular RV owner to Floridian to duo RV owner, to homeowner is truly a blessing to watch
Random question, this may show my arrogance regarding my limited interaction with home schooled kids but... Has Micarah ever been tested for ADHD? Shes got the ADHD vibe but Im not sure.
You have been working hard, so, you deserve the house.
Congratulations!!! Isn't roller skating inside just the bee's knees😄
I adore you! CONGRATS! <333
Micarah! You DO deserve this! I'm so happy for you, you look so incredibly overjoyed to have a house and man, would I love to live on bleep street.
That sentence joke was amazing. 😂😂😂
CONGRATS! That’s all I’m going to say
Congratulations! Please don't ever stop calling it Bleep Street. Also, people suck! Be careful. Maybe get a big ass dog and gun.
YAY
Nah mate I still reckon she still stole the house
Your excitement makes me so happy your adorable
My 24 year old(yes, old lady’s watch your channel😬), just bought his first house near Orlando.   It really is so fantastic and such an exciting adventure. He’s single😏.
I wanna go to Regency and Victorian tea parties
I'm so happy for you, you deserve it, it's the fruits of your hard work and the joy you give us
Just pure, unfiltered joy for 14 minutes straight? hecc yeah!
I'm so happy for you!!
Congratulations on your new home!
Congratulations on getting your own place 🥳
Omg I LOVE IT, I’m living my house dreams through you
If anyone acc did stalk you then that’s completely uncalled for & entirely creepy - I hope they leave you alone
This is so exciting
This is where Harry Potter will sleep when he comes to visit   Me: YES
I am so happy you finally found your dream home now you should have enough room to cut fabric
i'm so happy for you!!!!!
Please, remake that amazing cupboard room from Herpes Poster. like small barbie place with pool or miniature growroom for fungi ♥.
I’m so happy for you Micarah!! Congratulations! Thank you for mentioning “staying with your parents until you are capable and comfortable”. That’s something I’ve been dealing with and it gives me some relief to know you are understanding. Anyways, cheers hun!
you deserve it aaaaall!!!  now read it again.
This was great advice. We need to normalize taking ur time to move out ❤️ and I also fear debt sooo I feel y’a there🔥
I almost cried this made me so happy seeing her so happy
I want to see the reaction of the people in the bank when she signed the papers with Garrian on her arm.
I'm so happy for you. 😭
Congratulations on the house! It looks so great! And might I also add how oddly inspiring this whole video was? I'm also a twenty-something still living with my parents, uneducated and scatterbrained. I'm currently stifling my creativity while working retail, and my dreams of marrying rich (which my dentist also recommends) are quickly disappearing. This gives me hope that maybe some day I too can find and afford my soulmate- I mean, dream house.
The people shaming your dad's home are the same people who will end up thousands of dollars in debt, so I wouldn't worry too much about what they think. Congradulations!
but you DO deserve it! you make people smile and forget about their troubles while they watch your videos. that is a valuable thing to do. glad to see something that makes you happy in return! ☺️💐💕
You're living the dream
God bless you I love this
I couldn’t be happier for a stranger than i am right now 🥺 congrats hun! 🥂✨🎉
HAHAH THAT TITANIC SCENE 🤣🤣
Off topic but your hair looks AMAZING
I just bought my first house too! Congratulations I know how stressful of a process finding a house is, but I felt the same way about mine when I walked into it. It felt right and it’s honestly the best feeling in the world. I’m so happy for you micarah! You deserve it 🥺❤️
When I saw this I thought it was fakeeeeee YOU BOUGHT A HOUSEEESS??!?!?!?!?!?!?
I just know that this house will be decorated beautifully and with so much character. I hope we get to see some of the renovations
I’m happy that she’s happy ❤️
I appreciate the contriversial statement as well. I’m 23 have ptsd anxiety and depression as well as being legaly blind. I still live with my mom and she’s supper awesome. She never makes me feel ashamed with living with her but when others find out I still do I can hear the discuss in there voice. Making me feal ashamed and embaresed but they don’t know how much I struggle on a daily bases. Sometimes it’s hard just to get out of bed or take a shower so to even think about living on my own is the last thing on my mind. It was just really refreshing to hear you say that nobody should be ashamed. It honestly made me cry tears of relearn that there’s at least a few people out there who don’t think you have to fallow a certain path through life.👍💚🕊🏚🏘🏡Ps you definitely deserve this. You have worked day in and day out saving and working to get to share you are now. You should be proud and I am proud for you👍🏚 💙💜😊☺️
CONGRATULATIONS 🎉 ON YOUR HOUSE 🏡
Oh wow. I'm so happy for you! Congrats :)
Congrats, it's very cute!
Is your bird named Garion because you've read The Belgariad too many times?
Congratulations!!!! 🎉 🏡
I know we're all supportive of the hoarding, but the collection of various vehicles and locations in which to dwell in the past few months was not the direction I was expecting this to go...
Good job
I 100% agree with the debt and living at home. I am 30 and single and i just don’t have the income to buy a house. However the amount of SHAME people put on you for living with your parents and the constant battering ram of questions of “when are you moving out” gets old. The reality is i would rather rent comfortably and afford all my furniture etc outright and not have the pressure of a mortgage over my head. People forget that being single (and particularly a woman) means significant disadvantage getting into the housing market and even being approved for rent without somebody else agreeing to risk themselves for your benefit. It sucks and I’m sooo happy for you!
Your personality and your smile is so contagious (no pun intented lol)
Oh my god! All the happiness in your new house!
I’m so happy for you!! Congrats!!
Congratulations!! And also I'm sorry creepy people creeped on you and your dad. Not cool!
You ABSOLUTELY deserve this! ☺️ So happy for you!!
IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU !!!!!!!!! AAAAAAA
Your style in this video looks like Blair Waldorf
Congrats! I have been watching your videos for a while!
She’s finally gonna live out her regency garden tea party dreams🌹 And I am soooo ready for the insta votes to do the sequel to the rv makeover series
I just got the notification for this video and I don't have time to watch but I had to come say congratulations to you!!! What an exciting endeavor! 💖🤘
If you see the reply. Pls
am i the only one who did not question for a second how micarah got into a vacant house to film..? i mean.....,, it’s micarah
Old homes is where it's at. Keep all that old house charm and please don't paint old stained wood.
don't say you don't deserve this! you totally do that home is gorgeoussss and yess disney princess calling her bird by name and having him fly to her hand <33333
This was so cute and I'm happy that you got a house that you love so much, I wish you happiness in your life your so sweet
so happy for you!!!! you so deserve it, thanx for sharing your wonderful barbiefull life with us with that's awesome narration voice!!!
Bought my first house at 18. It wasn't nice or fancy. Wasn't in a great neighborhood, but it was and has been cheaper than rent. I worked 2 and 3 jobs to do it, and sustained it along with another house I bought as a single mom.  I still have my first house rented out, sold the second one and bought an 1885 4300sqft Victorian in a small town.... because normal people can't afford city living.
Getting your first house always feels amazing! Congratulations 👏
That was really cute at the end
Don’t worry I am a kid and I am not creepy
from what i hear about chipotle when you go there you can use 2 bathrooms at the same time.
I’m almost twenty and completely unable to move out of my parents house for various reasons, but oh my gosh! The amount of hope this gave me to have my own cute home, I can’t wait  Edit: I want to thank everyone for their support and stories! It really makes me feel so much better. I'm constantly told I need to move out but I have alot of disabilities that make it hard. Honestly thank you all so much, it really makes me feel alot better about my situation
Thumbs up if at a glance you read I bought a horse
EEEEEEEE SHE GOT A HOUSE, WHAAAAAA
ILYSM
That house is adorable! I can't wait to see what you do to it!
congrats my queen! and rip to gary for having to learn the layout of a new place. he really said don't interact, only the real homies know my pain.
This is so wholesome and I'm so proud of yoU, YAY!!!
I too don't believe in sidewalks.
Congratulations Micarah! I hope you make a ton of happy memories in that house!❤️❤️❤️❤️  Okay but seriously I NEVER skip her sponsorships. Like she actually makes them entertaining. Sis knows how to sell a product👀💅🏼
You are the only channel where I actually watch homemade adds. They are very funy and imformative.
You never fail to make me laugh Micarah
Oh I’m so excited for house renovation and decoration videos!!  Edit: Wow this is my first comment on this channel 😂😂I’ve been subbed for maybe 6 months???
Congrats!
real takeaway: she doesn't believe in sidewalks
K i commented before i finished the video, this is so cool. So happy for you!!
YAYYY
Oh my God I knew it
Dylan is in trouble and you would make the best couple
Working hard to be able to buy a house isn't a privilege. You worked for it. You deserve what you work for.
wow ur literally a disney princess you called for ur bird and they actually memorized ur house layout and came😭
But if I don't go to the nail salon for my manicure, who will ask me uncomfortable questions like if I have kids or want kids, and tell me how small my hands and nails are?
I guess we were too dumb to figure out you bought a house in the last video 🤷‍♀️😂
Congratulations! I'm so proud of you! 👏👏👏👏👏👏
congratulations!
congratsss!!
I Amm sooo HAPPY FOR YOUUUU🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I’m so proud of you!!! I watched this with my bird! Well not really he kinda of just tried to stand on my phone but ended up falling over
I know it’s tempting but guys no one go over to Bleep street to visit Gareon, he has a very busy schedule.
Omg my third comment but do you have a fan mail address
Congrats on the house! You deserve it! Thank you for making my day better every time you upload!
Housing around here is as bad as my health.  I might probably never be able to actually buy a house, but even finding a place to rent around here has proven a near impossible job. But this video has sparked me so much with joy! AND HOPE. I am so happy and excited for you to have a nice place for yourself and your bird, and I am longing so much to have that for me and a little cockatiel that I could just feel the enthousiasm like it was forshadowing for my own future someday!  I starting watching your videos whilst I became unable to work and they have been inspiring and empowering. You gave me my confidence to sew, create and craft back and are definetly one of my positive influences that I really needed. That alone (and I am sure I am not the only one whose days or motivation get a little better thanks to your vids)  is a fair enough reason for you to deserve this! Congratulations on the house! <3   And to think I first came by your videos because I saw a chicken.
the fact that ur so happy about it gives me so much serotonin
Now that she is living alone , please don't go to her house , if you ever figure out where it is . It is so scary , especially when someone lives alone !
wow so micarah is making so much money on youtube that she got to just buy a house cash without a mortage??? damn! impressive... makes me wonder why i am studying and working so hard and not even enjoying it just to work a job in which i will be hardly able to rent a nice house and not even buy one while micarah is enjoying her "work" and making apparently a lot/enough to buy a house...
OMG CONGRATS
CONGRATULATIONS!
What about the RV?
This is like the only “I bought a house” video that I have seen that didn’t sound like bragging about their 200,000 sq ft mansion
she’s so naturally hilarious i love her
I’m going to finally reveal..“coughs like an iPad kid”
I thought I would never see the day she would buy a house 😂 does this mean we will see less of your dad because it’s not one of your videos without the chickens or any bird and your dad
So, I haven’t followed you for much time, but you have this level of likeability I’ve never seen before.  Seeing you feeling this happy and accomplished made my day!! I hope you have the BEST time at your new home!!!
ok Micarah is GENUINELY funny like i actually love watching her from start to finish😂😂
Your house is beautiful
My god. I hope Glamnetic up the amount of money they gave you for that sponsorship. I have never been more entertained by a sponsorship AND wanted to buy the product😭😭😭
I’m so happy for you!! Congratulations and keep up your hilarious exciting videos. You always make me laugh at least 10 times right out loud!!!
Congratulations, it looks like a lovely house and I'm looking forward to seeing you create things for it in your future videos
Congrats on the house! And I am sorry about the creepy dude...
Anyone else notice how she made the video 14 minutes long?
This is kind of weird and annoying but you being so happy makes me so happy you don’t even know
Micarah: **posts**  Me: **looks at homework** it can wait  I am the queen of the procrastiNATION   😂
She is the only youtuber that I don’t skip her sponsers
Congrats Micarah! Where does one go for fourty dollar awesome sofas?
You have the absolute most patient father
Okay honestly i was like not thinking that she bought a house because watching for so long we would’ve assumed that she just entered a house illegally an shot there lolol but hey congrats
Congrats Micarah!! We can't wait to see what you do with the place!!
I guess she has 💫debtphobia💫
Girl props on doing the 14 minutes again
I would gladly watch some commercial if I know it has some part in making you so happy. A non creepy fan from Romania
YOU DESERVE IT BAE!
Congratulations! It’s a gorgeous house! Those columns are it. Also those look like great stairs for a dress reveal. Like those scenes where everyone stops and turns to watch the main character walk down the steps after some princess transformation or something.
Congrats on your new home. It looks very welcoming.
Glamnetic sales after th video 📈📈📈📈
Sooooo how does one send her something
I thought the cutoff in your last video was an intentional cliffhanger for us to mull over 😂
You've mentioned Titanic a few times which could either mean you just watched Titanic or maybe your making a dress from the movie 👀
Yay girl may I ask if you would sew something like a tutorial please
I CAN RELATE SOO MUCH WITH A DAD THAT OFFERES YOU 24/7   SCRAMBLED EGGS!!!!! 😆
OMG MICARAH im so happy for you!!! You most certainly DO deserve this house!! 💖💖💖
When the fear of debt joke hits too hard 😬😬😬
So many titanic references yes
Jesus Christ people, don't go to her home.  Quit being garbage.
<33333333
I'm gonna be honest, I genuinely had no idea how you got in that house. The thought of you purchasing a house never even crossed my mind lol But that's great! I'm very jealous but also super happy for you! ♥
girl you 100% deserve this!!!!!! congrats <3
I'm so sorry that your dad's house was disturbed. I am from Russia, but I saw a video on youtube about how some crazy fans figured out the location of the famous American bloggers' property and came to visit them without invitation, and the terrible thing is that some crazy guy did it without even looking at a house. He saw the clouds circulation and the dislocation of the stars in the sky and calculated the location... So, it's up to you, of course, but I think you'd better not to show the look outside your windows and the facade of your house😐Sorry for the unasked advice
I love your affinity for laying in patches of sunlight! I too seek them out and take a nap like a cat. I’ve related to you in other ways and I think its because we were both homeschooled! You’re giving me confidence to be my weird self and I am happy to be apart of your audience!
oh my god im obsessed with you
Congrats, well deserved 🎉 👏
This makes me so happy, she totally deserves a home and a wonderful one too. It's a place to run wild with creativity and I am excited for whatever comes next :)
The way I thought you just broke into a house
this made me so happy and excited omg sending u all my love
So excited to see chaotic house content :)
congrats!!!!!!
I’m moving back in with my family and I highly recommend it, I’m going to save about $400/month
Micarah, this video made me smile. I've been sick for the past two days, and your video was like a ray of sunshine peaking though the dark clouds. Thank you so much, and congratulations on your new house.
hahaha I can Feel Your Happiness, Congratz!!! Good luck and Fortune to you and your new house!
So happy for you!
“i bought an RV!”  “i bought another RV!” “I bought an House!!”
Does anyone know if she has a PO Box?
Congratulations! How exciting!
Congratulations 👏
i wish you the best life ever in your new home <3 Congrats and hugs from Germany ;)
Congratulations!  What a charming home. What a smart young lady you are to stick with Dad and do things right. My daughter did the same thing. Your father must be very proud.
Yay!
Micarah has fantastic taste ❤️ I love that house ❤️❤️❤️
YEAH YOU DID
I am so happy for you! you deserve this. you are amazing and congrats!!!!
micarah: tewers is easy to type, letters are next to each other belgium: *cries in azerty*
Omg I am sooooo happy for you
I got so happy for you and Garreon I cried. 😅 You two are the sweetest weirdos out there 💜
That letter to the seller is a work of art I would pick you over any other offer
I can't believe my favorite part was the glamnetic commercial
CONGRATS
congrats !!!!
OMG You look so HAPPY! I've been watching for years and seeing you this excited over this is making me excited too!!
You are amazing ! So happy for you 😍🤍
No one deserves it more than you!
You are so precious
you straight up waterboarded that hand puppet lol also  congrats!!!! ur amazing and i’m happy for u!!
lol
That house is amazing! I love that style too. Somehow I've become an antique-er. That's a word. And I'm now a proud owner of several beautiful antiques that would look great in a home of that style. Maybe someday. Enjoy your new home!!! 🏠🛼🕊☕🍾🥂🎉🎊🎉🎊
Oh my goshhhh congratulations!
Normally i wouldn't even watch videos like this but when i saw this I said. 'OmG Micarah got a mf house '
you still filmed the outside of your house... unless it was a deception
i can’t think of anyone else more deserving than this! I love you so much & it made me emotional to see you so happy!
Sooo happy for you!! I got a house (to rent, but still) accepted today and I'm equally as giddy!!!!❤️
If you’re the butthead going to her dad’s house and being creepy, I will PERSONALLY fight you. Cut that crap out. 😡😡😡
I literally closed Disney + watching princess diaries to come to YouTube and now im here in the comments after 1.05 mins
I don’t think I’ve ever seen a YouTuber be so happy about a house before.
No problem sis ^_^ happy i could make you happy 🥰 thinking really seriously about those lashes tho... i mean someone has gotta pay for your furniture!! 🤣
"you, You, You, YOU. have given me more then I ever dared to dream." Me: "awwh thank you" "well that's not totally true" Me: "oh" *deep hurt*
Those clips of you basking in the sunlight were hella cinematic 😂 Aaaaah, this video made me so happy for you!! What a well-deserved privilege, I'm so glad you get to have it ❤️
Realtors are the same in Australia,  useless.   Congrats on the house!
Her brain works exactly how mine does and I love it
🖤
I'm SO happy for her!! go Micarah!! go Garreon!! you deserve this so much!
You looked so happy that even I got happy about the house! I have the same fears as you lol
YES QUEEN
djlsjdiwkdi You deserve it! I'm so proud!!!! ♥️
Wow Micarah that is just gorgeous! The house is beyond beautiful super happy for you! #goals
I am so sorry you have to deal with creeps. Please take all the precautions you can for your safety it will be money well spent.
Seeing her happy makes me happy :)
this is like the only i bought a house video which is genuinely wholesome im so happy for youuuuuuuuu <3
I've been following you for a long time, way back when I couldn't believe someone so talented would have so few followers. Now you have over 1.6M! That is incredibly awesome. I'm very happy for you, you certainly deserve to have purchased your dream home. I look forward to following you for many years to come.
Cg cg cg
Congratulations Micarah 👏🏼 so happy for you, your humble self deserves to be happy.
So happy for you! Congratulations!
This reminded me of Danny Gonzalez's house tour, "don't be coming to my house" 😂😂
Congraaats! ❤️❤️❤️
Oh what did i just watch,, I think it was a representation of my thoughts of my brain in real life for everyone to see... "Wow that was scary".. Just kidding love your quirkiness
Congratulations!! This is super exciting and I can't wait to see what you do to the place. Birb birb gonna fly free and happy
What about rv
I have debt phobia too! Although I'm in college. I just worked my whole life and got a ton of scholarships.
You deserve your house and more Micarah 💖💖 Also I feel so much better about being 24 and living with my mom now 😂
AHHHH
I'm so happy for you! My husband and I can't wait to get a house!
You seem like the person to have a bunkbed just to have choise where to sleep
CONGRATSSS
are you a trump supporter, somebody said you were
Oh my goodness I’m so proud of you xx
This is so wonderful! You definitly deserve this! <3
omggg I KNEW IT why do u say u dont deserve it? you DOOOO
I'm so happy for you I'm crying
I don’t believe in sidewalks 🥰
WOW
Congratulations! I’m happy for you! 🤩🤩🤩
Micarah I am so happy for you ! You are my role model and seeing you so happy makes me happy ! I hope you stay safe and no one finds out your address 🙏
This was actually the best house tour I've ever seen.
I love your face I can just see your happiness I love you❤️❤️❤️
OMG.... I'm so happy for you (: congratulations.
This is wholesome! But im concerened were she got the rack out 🤣 But I hope everyone respect micarahs privacy and safety.  Please stay safe!
Congrats
wtf? why is there a law against filming in a house tour??? it should just be that its allowed if the owner allows you to film
I CLICKED SO FAST I DONT THINK ENGLISH CLASS IS IMPORTANT
I found it funny how it just randomly cut off
all jokes aside i hope you are well and safe. i hope you feel secure in your new home.  and for the people coming by to your dad's house: GET OFF THEIR SWAMP!!! not okay. even if you are fans and want to bring gifts it's still not okay. that's just fucking creepy.
its so beautiful how happy the house makes you! Just watching makes me smile! Seeing someone that excited brings me so much joy!
I'm so excited for u yay
That was wholesome AF
I actually kinda teared up at the Risky Business shot just knowing how much fun you were having I am so happy for you 😭
the way i watched this while deciding whether or not to get an apartment with my first full time job (within my first month of working). thank you for this advice you unknowingly gave me at the exact perfect time.
This woman just lives the dream and I’m so excited to be like her some dat
Fun fact. YouTube always adds 1sec more to the video time. So if you wanted it to be 14:00 you have to make it 13:59
Thought that said horse and I was confused but excited
My son is 20 and he still lives at home with me. He has been told he can move out when he feels ready and able to do so.
Omg that semicolon joke tho; it was fantastic
I bet I’ll also be as happy as you are when I get a house also. I’ll probably also be very suprised
You've made my 2020 a hundred times better. Thank YOU. you deserve this!!!! 🎉🎊🎉🎊🎉🎊🎉🎊
"I know i dont deserve this" GIRL WHAT??? YOU DO YOU DESERVE THIS AND MUCH MORE!!!!!!!!!! 🗣 I'm so happy 🥰🌸
aww dude, that's really awesome! i hope you have plenty of privacy and comfort, that place is beautiful
Your house is Beautiful beautiful it’s amazing I love it ssooo sooo sooo much and your bird is thee most adorable bird I have ever seen also did you have to train him to come to you or does he just love you so much that he comes when his name is called
American houses are so funny to me. Like “most people didn’t want only one bathroom” I honestly believe that like... probably 80% of houses in my country have only one bathroom lol, usually only an extra restroom downstairs if it’s two or three stories. We shared one shower with a family of six growing up and that’s pretty normal here
MIRAH YOU CANT JUST TELL US YOUR HOBBY IS PUTTING WIGS ON ROADKILL AND NOT SHOW US PICTURES
This video is wholesome, you can tell she is genuine about owning her home. We are happy for you Micarah and 1/2! ❤️
That was the best ad I've ever watched through...
So excited for you!!!! I feel so happy that in a teeny tiny way each of us pitched in for you to have The Dream House!!!! Looking forward to new videos from there!
so happy for you!!
My mom is a realtor, and I wouldn't just look on zillow because it doesn't show you an accurate price and doesn't show all of the houses problems Just a helpful tip :3
I look forward to those "redecorating my ______" chaotic videos.
Belonging somewhere is a really good feeling. Glad you’re home.
Aww I’m so happy for you!!
Awe I'm so happy for you 💗💗💗
im so happy for you!!! ♥️♥️♥️
That's so cool! I want to have a tea party with you. I can bring my tea set. It is footed (imagine a tea set and a clawed bathtub had a child) and is very pretty. But I doubt that will ever happen. Oh well. Have fun in your house!
“And hopefully host regency and Victorian tea parties at” a whole mood, please invite me
Your sponsorship was so good I forgot there was a video afterwards and got confused 😂😂
I'm so happy for this girl. She's just has a certain kind of genuine personality that I should get annoyed with but I end up loving. You all know what I mean 🤣🤣
Congrats!!!
So happy for you!!!💖🥰
THAT'S SO ADORABLE
Yay! I can literally FEEL your joy through the screen! It's amazing that you have a house now! By the way, you looked really pretty flopping down on that bench where the sun just perfectly hit your face-
I am from Iraq😎! Congrats on the new house, I totally get the reaction when you first got into it,  had the same when I bought my own... Stay safe out there!
Omg I have also never used two bathrooms at once we have so much in common! We should talk more 😂
...And they say money does not make you happy.
I love this video! This is a good one *nodds*
Happy for you !! This is amazing
Great house! I love the antique quality products that went into making houses from the past. Congrats!
I am so sorry that you get harassed by people
Can you invite me to the regency tea parties? ☺
Anyone else want to boycott liking the verified comments? All they are doing is looking for likes and people to look at their channels.
Rv give away?
She called me out when she said clowns 😭✋
When she said that her biggest fear was debt, I thought she said death so I was just kinda like “what does death have to do with chewing one piece of gum for 4 days??”
YOU DESERVE THAT BEAUTIFUL HOUSE ENJOY IT GOSH DARN IT
I was having a bad day and this video cheered me up so much. You radiate such positive energy and you helped me realize that one person can do so much and find their happiness in so many different ways. Thank you for this, so happy for you xx
Her smile when shes says she has a house is the most purest fucking thing I have ever seen
Imma be real in the other video I thought youd just trespassed ngl
Yay! Congratulations! How many animals are you going to have now??
My house was made in 1908 so you can move in here and also it looks like the 1950s in here
I don't know which of you are the creepy ones skskskskks
Omg that's such a pretty house 😲🥺❤❤
congratulations broski
We're so happy for you Micarah! You've worked so hard, created so much, and your videos are inspiring and hilarious. You've earned every inch of the house you just bought. Can't wait to see more in new videos! :D
Congrats Micarah!!!!!!!
That was very wholesome ❤️
If you can’t accept it for your self then accept it for us. We crave home renovation content
YAY MICARAH!!! Congrats on the new house!!
I. Would. LOVE to attend a Micarah Tewers Victorian tea party. I promise I’m not creepy 😇😂 also just saying Micarah could literally be a model like those shots with the sunlight just *chef kiss*.
So sweet watching you be this happy!
Aw! My cat was sleeping but the excited sounds from your bird woke her up haha! She's very confused now
your house is sooo pretttyyyyy i am jealous
Too bad y'all are creepy stalkers with no concept of boundaries because I'd really like to see her pretty house from outside...
You’re the perfect level of weird. 💜💜
i didnt even watch yet but congrats!!!
awh, I'm sooo excited!
Congratulations!!! You're new house looks AMAZING!!!!!
I'm genuinely happy for you :)
does Gerion love his flying space?
Its so bizar to me that she made so much  so fast with YouTube video's . Offcourse she deserves it ! I freaking love her ... but the influencer pay  is crazy and i dont think it should be this high....  its bizar ....something is Just not right with this system
This was a nice unintentional birthday present.
(・∀・)
Call me shallow, but I love seeing you your legs in a cute skirt lol. Your editing process must be crazy. Always an outstanding job. I keep thinking Bravo or the Discovery channel are going to give you a call and ask to create a Micarah Tewers show. The Public will surely love you as much as I do.
Congrats! I am so happy for you 💗
i am so incredibly happy for you. your videos always make me smile and you've worked for your success. you're a truly inspiring person. congratulations on your new home ♡
“Let me have my fear.” Amen!!
CONGRATS!!!! also screw those creeps what the heck.
..I would love even a cheep studio apartment and here she is with a house... One day I will leave my parents.. one day
HELLO WE LOVE YOU
NO WAY YAYYYYY
Lol she’s the only YouTuber that I won’t skip the sponsored portion cause she just makes it so funny and fun to watch
I didn't even realize she was talking about the sponsor-
Damn, I’ve been watching you for some years now, I’m so proud 🥺🥺🥺
happy for you micarah ☺️💜 it's just so weird how the standard of living differs wildly from country to country...it boggles my mind how people my age can just go and buy a house or an apartment, where i live that's basically a impossible without getting into a massive debt that you pay off for the rest of your life since you'll never earn enough to pay it off in a reasonable time lmao
Congratulations on your new house, I think that you do deserve it.
I saw the title and though "congrats" and now im here soooooooooo CONGRATS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Awww I'm so happy for you❤
I’m so happy for youuuu🥺
im so happy for you

Wow, did you guys know she bought a house?

congratulations!!!!!!! also i swear i want like a video for each room that you redo youre rv makeover videos were so fun.
Watching her can bighten any mood
You absolutely deserve this! You've made so many people happy, or grossed out depending on which video they're watching. Enjoy your home, Micarah 😊❤😊 Can't wait to see what sewing projects you start and then inevitably procrastinate
Love you Micarah!! You totally diserve it, with your hard work. Love ya giiirll! You are the best! 😍😍🤗🤗🤗
You are the only Youtuber that i watch ur inbuilt ads for because you make them so good
CONGRATS MICARAH!!!!! we all love you and we're proud
Congrats! I’m so happy for you 🥺🥺
AHHHHHH IM OBSESSED WITH YOU! pls notice me?
I’m so excited you bought a house. You absolutely deserve it! We can’t wait to watch you decorate every inch and host tea parties. And thank you for rationalizing living with parents. You are a treasure!
CONGRATS GIRL! :D <3
Yes!! If you can live with your parents while you build to financial independence there should be no shame in it.
The 1 bathroom gag was fucking hilarious
I know this wasn't the main focus of the video but it's honestly so heartbreaking to hear about your experience with creepy people. *NO ONE* deserves that and I hope you're okay
You definitely deserve a house! Congrats & Well Done! Also Garreon is the most amazing bird ever lol x
What an uplifting video! I'm so glad for you and wish you well in your upcoming home-owner shenanigans!!
This video had no right being this entertaining
your videos make me SO HAPPY :D
I'm so glad you listened to my instagram DM letting you know about creepers who would be able to find your address. 5:51 in the video.  You should opt out of the sites that have your information like I said so that they don't list your new address.
I’m shook
I'm so happy for you!!!!
My mom was just talking about these lashes!! I have got to buy her some!!
I'm so happy for you Micarah! You sweet, talented, and hilariously crazy soul deserve it!! <3 <3 <3 Congratulations you house-owner you!
So! Wholesome! TT TT I wish most new house tours vids actually has this type of energy. Like being genuinely excited of the house they bought, not just a knockoff MTV Cribs episode.
Woooooow I've never seen Micarah soooo happy! Congratulations!🔥🔥🔥
Over three minutes of advertising for a 14 minute video, and mink lashes? Girl, I know you gotta mortgage to pay, but don't be a sell out, and stick to the content that gave you so many subs in the first place.
I'm happy to see you so excited!!! Of course you deserve this house. Congratulations!!!!!
This has become my comfort video🥺❤️
When you said "I have a house" at 13:48, I couldn't stop smiling.
Congratulations!!
Congrats!!! You definitely deserve the house!! :) Btw, I also don't think that being afraid of debt is a bad thing. It's a very good thing!!! (As a European, I think it's a bit weird how easily most people from the USA spend "credit card money")
I'm sorry... had to exit this video after that "joke"... but I came back bc I'm too much of a fan and didn't want to lose my cool! 🙃🤭
She makes me want to homeschool my future children.
Happy Micarah makes me smile :)  I hope you enjoy it!
POG
Congrats♥️
Congrats Micarah!   Hope you and Garyen (sp?)  enjoy your beautiful home.
NEED MORE HOUSE VIDEOS
I feel same way about debt and not wanting to think of buying something if I don't have the money in my bank account. Phew, not alone
Oh congratulations!! It looks amazing and I'm sure you'll make it even prettier! <3 (and sorry to hear abt the creeps, hope they go away :[ )
Aaah so exited for you!
The makeover is gonna be insane
As someone who's been teased by a few of my friends for being 24 and still living with my mom you saying you believe kids should stay home until their ready meant a lot to me. I'm not ready leave home one day but I know I'll be ready some day.   Anyways congratz on the house!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm so happy for you <3 So exciting. Congratulations <3
y'all do realise that this woman is not just as but funnier than SNL.
Y’all hear that Micarah got a house? I heard she got a house.
you have a magical ability of keeping me entertained through a sponsored section and you should be very proud of that
Now you have room for your Ariana Grande dress 😂😂
Congratulations, enjoy your house!
micareh I'm so happy for you! You definitely deserve this!
You’re welcome is all as I can say as one subscriber watching ads for you 😅😂🤣
I AM CRYINGGGG THAT WAS TOO DEEP
OMG!!! I'm so excited for all the chic hoarding!! 🥰🤩
God bless you and your home! I love you and you deserve it!
Congratulations! It's a beautiful home. I love how the upstairs windows go all the way down to the floor. Can't wait to see what you do with it.

I'm just so happy to see you so happy !!
“you believe in reincarnation?” “no but they might.” omg i love you and i’m so happy that you’re happy with your house!!!
Ohio needs to review it's laws on filming/photographing houses people are just thinking about buying. How you are going to appeal to the youtubers OHIO? YOU GOTTA STAY HIP! GET THE LIKES OHIO!
Am I the only one who can't wait for home decore videos
I was thinking of moving out of my mom's rn (I'm 18) but seeing this made me decide to stay, put up with her, and save up for my own house where I can do backflips all around my own house and run around saying "I HAVE MY OWN HOUSE!!!!" thank you🖤
Micarah’s videos must be the only ones that I watch and WANT the sponsor part to keep going
You are a frigging crack up! I live for ur videos
clapping all the way through 6:33-6:45
So many congrats! This is amazing! So when you making a dress out of carpet?
Hi Micarah, first I would like to said I love watching your videos. Watching them reminds me of learning how to sew by my grandmother. And I am so happy for you for buying a house and I'm total with you on having a fear of loans and debt. It's one of my dreams of having a Victorian house more specifically the house from practical magic but I realized that it would take so long to clean and too many rooms for one person and very expensive to build. So I made a new goal of getting a condo and this video just help me stay motivated to keep working for it.
I READ THE TITLE AS HORSE??@?=?#*#*#*"
HELLO
Gosh you are the sweetest, very lovely home !
*Harry Potter liked your video*
You're so cute omg congrats!!!!
Micarah: I don't want to show the front of my house because of saftey reasons The thumbnail: 👁👄👁
wholesome. congrats on the house!!
Micarah talking about "people of her age" and I wouldn't be surprised if she was either 14 or 44.
this was so cute ugh
Omgggg I’m so happy for you, love your videos and I’m sorry some people have been stalking you :(
Congrats!!!
me and a friend are trying to design u a tiny house for an architectural competition,, now it is a bit pointless I see:(((( congrats though!!!!!!!
That email though XDXDXD
Love the house!!! I must request an entire video of garian. Thank you.
MY DAD OFFERS TO MAKE EGGS LITERALLY EVERY TIME I AM HOME😂🙌🏼
The first thing I said befor even watching the video is "aww congratulations!"  and I'll say it again "aww congratulations!"
you absolutely deserve this. you worked hard and saved and you bought a house! ❤️
Muchas felicidades por tu casa 🏡💕
This house suites you so much! I can't wait to see all the painting, diys and tiny renos you do! 💜
24???? Girl I thought you were literally 18
"Fear of debt" honestly that might be the most normal, rational thing about you :)
This is come Queen Shit right here
u da best
She is so happy that it makes me happy
Oh, Micarah, we're your viewers. We're all the weird ones.
Video suggestion: The Heathers outfits or just one Heather (I think you'd look good as Heather Chandler :0 )
I love your Videos, and am so happy for you and Gerion. You deserve the house, and am so excited to see what you do with it.
I am so happy for you, yay!! Can't wait to see what you get up to with all the new space.
I’m happy you bought a house but this was the longest commercial ever
seeing you this happy makes me happy!
Congrats!! It’s adorable and I have no doubt you will make it a quirky, beautiful home that matches it’s owner! ❤️
Congratulations.   Now you need to fill your new house full of birds or children. Whatever calls to you. 😂
YAAAAAS CONGRADULATIONS!!!!!!! :D :D :D
I hate those creepy people v much. I hope you got a security system!!
We need to stop the idea that young people don't deserve a place to live
So now Micarah living rent-free isn't exclusive to our brains.
I’m so happy for you! You’re amazing and you and your son deserve this!
i usually skip through 15 seconds advertisements but I watched her 3 minutes paidpromo entirely, she's just so entertaining
You deserve this!
Congratulations on getting your new home! Also welcome to adulthood where owning a home can become stressful at times.
Of course you deserve this your so talented and funny. You make my day better every time I watch your videos. It so glad you found the perfect house can’t wait to see what you do with it.
You know her decorating is gonna be really interesting
You do deserve this !
Everyone should have a right to have a house like this to be honest. Its so sad that few of us will get that option.
She made me so happy at the end, and when she was screaming out her window that she got a house
You are adorable, and I’m so happy for you!!! Congratulations on your beautiful home!
Congratulations
I am so so so HAPPY for you girllllll !!!!!
Can all the youtubers promoting nails please STOP hating on salons. I have paid money to go to school and I have paid money to open my salon and I continue to pay money to keep it running.  This is my livelihood!  Not a freaking hobby!

Congratulations!!!
That is a darling house and a REALLY nice sofa! Congrats... you deserve it!!!

That's some poker face you brought to those negotiations.💚 Congratulations!
Well. I want fake lashes now.
I am soooo happy for youuu 🥺 You are such a cutie piee 🥺❤️
For the first time ever on youtube, im actually happy a youtber bought a house because they guineinly seem happy and appreciative instead of like they shouldve gotten it to begin with. this woman deserves so much and i am so happy for her.
I feel like almost any other youtuber would make me roll my eyes on them flexing because they got subscribers but I'm legit just so happy for micarah. Like yes, I got my baby girl a house! 🏠
That’s so exiting!!! I’m happy for you c:
Are you going to make one of the rooms into like a display room for all your dresses?
Omg Congrats Micarah and of course you freaking deserve it!!!!!!

You absolutely deserve this! CONGRATS!! 🎉🎉🎉  Also, as a 25-year-old who hasn't yet moved out of my mom's house (even though I'd love to), thank you for making me feel less judged. 💖
Real happy for you!
She’s the only YouTuber that I don’t skip the sponsorships for because she makes them so interesting and funny
Such a beautiful house, it suits you! It has a lot character, love it! YOU DESERVE THIS
this is the most wholesome thing i've seen in a while :') I felt the same way when I moved out of my mum's home, even though it's rented lol but it's MY rented apartment and I love it for now so it's all good
oh the hand lashes give my own eyelashes shivers
“I don’t know which one of you are the creepy ones...” 😂😂😂
She's me like I bought something pretty cool and yeah all mine
OMG HOUSE
How can a video be so chaotic and cute at the same time?
Congrats Micarah 🎉🎉🎉.
Oh honey you deserve this!!! You deserve all of this- thank you for all the wonderful content you've given us. All the great memories and silly stories, seeing you get a house is amazing!!! And other positive adjectives!!!! Adjectives? Hmm no that's wrong anyways yay!!!! HOUSE!!! (Also I'm sorry people are creepy that's not okay)
Omg I'm praying for your safety i swear one of my nightmares is getting followed it feels bad  STAY SAFE EVERYONE
Don't show your house key on the internet (the thumbnail)! People can recreate it using only a photo!    Also, congrats! This makes me excited to buy my own home one day! 😁
You're an inspiration. A unique muse.
who art thou and how did ye apear on my recomended
Micarah, congratulations!! I love the house, it’s gorgeous! The color of the floors are lovely!
You are a wholesome drop of sunshine; your creativity and wit bring so much joy to this world. You 100% deserve your beautiful house. Also if creepy guys are being creepy at you and violating yours or your dads privacy/making you feel unsafe, I will fight them.
I can definitely see how genuinely happy you look! Congratulations, Micarah :3
😁😁😁😁
Wishing you lots of love and happiness in your new home!!  (I also read the title as "I bought a hose" and was thinking- what is she up to now with a hose and why so excited? . lol)
I swear we are the same person sometimes. Lol when I get art famous, may I attend one of your fancy Victorian tea parties parties?
OMG ARE YOU GONNA GET A DOG NOW
its the titanic scene for me
Congratulations! ✨💕
Congrats Micarah!!!! Yay
It's terrible how you were forced out of your parent's house by nasty men, im so sorry you went through all that.
What about your RV?
you gave that lonely bird the best life
What about your chickens? Are they staying with your dad?
I'm happy for her but like... wasn't it her dream to more to Florida? Why buy a house in Ohio?
Congratulations on being a home owner!!!
Can confirm I am 100% not the creep kind. Can I come over now? 👁👄👁
I smiled the whole video. Does that make me a creep? I'm just so happy to see others happy. And are you kidding with that beautiful sofa? Only 40 dollars? You're amazing!
YOU DESERVE THIS!!
Your house is beautiful!!! You are super talented, you deserve it! ❤️
I'm somewhat sad you're moving from your dad's house cause it feels like an end of an era. But so happy for you, too!!! You do deserve it.
You do deserve it !!!!
The one sponsorship product I would actually buy
IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU I CANT WAIT TO SEE HOW YOU DECORATE
proud of you <3
LOVE U AND YOU DESERVE ALL OF THIS
ONCE AGAINNN AN 14:00 MIN VIDEOO  Check its actually 14 min and Micarah didnt have to cut off her words this time
This actually came as a surprise. I was like I did not even think of second thing you cut the thing off. I have seem the Valentine video a few times and I did not gave it a second though. I have seen comments saying their not surprised. I am also, surprised how does peolpe know where you live?! I thought were doing good at hiding it. Well, I am glad for you and I am also scare of debt. HAVE A GREAT DAY!! Also sorry for my grammar.
Can you make a video about Garian? I want to know what breed of bird he is and how you trained him so so so well! I’ve always wanted a bird and he seems so darn sweet and loving 🥰
You’re welcome, Sugar Booger! ❤️🏠  Congratulations on your new home!!
Congratulations!!! 🥳👏👏👏
This video is 14 min too  Sooo is this gonna be a THING ???!
seeing Micarah get a home gives me hope that i'll be able to afford one one day

MICARAH HOW DID YOU KNOW ABOUT MY DEEP FEAR OF CLOWNS
i was just looking at houses to buy, but I am only 18
This content is just so next level wholesome I love it
You had me fooled, in your last video I just assumed you had broken into a cute house to take the pics
Yaaaayyyyyy u bought a houssse
Hey!!! BE CAREFUL!!! Your key is shown in the thumbnail and people can copy it based on that image! Its not easy to do but be CAREFUL!!!
You are honestly the sweetest person ever. The ending nearly brought me to tears. Congrats Micarah
I’m so proud of her 😊
Wow
If you don't feel like painting your counters, try putting contact paper on them! We're using it as a temporary solution for our stained and dingy counters and they look GREAT. The Handyman's Daughter has a good tutorial on it, and a link to vinyl contact paper!
13:40 you just casually laying in the sun is so elegant like how?!?
Congratulations, Micarah!
So happy for you! Pls take us along your home decor/remodeling projects! Also, glad ur moving away from the creepers!
you're so happy omg i love it you're just so happy it's infectious even through a screen and now im happy too :)
Gosh, I’d marry you.   #hilarious
Honestly you DO DESERVE THIS!!!! I’m so happy you are who you are (an amazing YouTuber that can entertain me FOREVER!) thank you for doing what you do! ❤️❤️❤️
I am LITERALLY SO HAPPY FOR YOU!  I teared up when I saw your thumbnail, and I just wanted to say I love your personality and editing style. I adore the elegant and fun aspects about your house, and I wish you blessings as you create into your own!
I'm SO HAPPY that my watching your videos helped in just a small way to afford such a BEAUTIFUL HOUSE. LOVE YOU MICARAH!!!

MICARAH I AM SO HAPPY FOR YOU !!!! THIS IS GREAT !!!!  You absolutely do deserve this house and I'm so glad you found one perfect for you !!!! This brought me so much joy to watch :D   Also appreciated that bit about living with your family until you're ready as someone still living with mine.   CONGRATS ON THE HOUSE 💞💞💞💞

I KNEW IT!! Congrats micarah!
OMG congrats Micarah!
The most responsible, hilarious and helpful YouTuber I follow. I’m so happy for you! Thank you for always sharing your advice, I definitely appreciate it!
Goodbye RV life
you deserve all the happiness in the world
Honestly after buying 2 rvs I was confused why you didn’t just get a home since those two purchases equal a down payment.
Good for you girl! Your success will be celebrated without envy. I am genuinely happy for you! God bless!
Have to watch twice, 1 what she does, 2 what she saids.  Congratulations!
micarah recreating titanic with her hands will never not be funny
LMAO IMAGINE A GIRL WITH A BIRD COMING INTO THE BANK TO BUY YOUR HOUSE & SIGNING THE PAPERS WITH A FEATHER PEN they've must've told everyone they know i know i would
shutup you absolutely deserve this. seeing how much work you’ve put into your channel doing what you love, garnering a following with your personality... not to sound like a suck up but you deserve it. enjoy your house, the sense of freedom must be insane. i feel pretty bleak about my future right now, but i hope if/when i come out on the other side, im as happy as you are.
Congrats!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️ You totally deserve this!
Congratulations !!
I am so happy for her, but can I ask for a second van tour. Just because we’ve seen a new house, but no van tour.
Congratulations, your excitement is infectious! I too now feel the need to own a space to fly free
i don't know if glamnetic deserves her 😩😩
I live in Ohio. Please let me come over 😭 I’ll bring my cat 🐈‍⬛
You so so deserve this! I'm so happy for you Micarah. I hope you enjoy life with Garian <3

🌷🌷 What do u mean u don't deserve it?!  Of course you do! You are the funniest and most creative and inspiring person I know (but actually not know)!  You deserve this house and so much more!  This video made me spill out milk from my nostrils while laughing and it was so enjoyable and funny to watch!  Congrats on your new house!  Thank you so much for wishing that you could invite me along with God knows how many other strangers in it!  Btw, happy women's day!  Thank you for deciding to do youtube ans not going to college, and being afraid of mortgages... thank you FOR BEING YOU, because you bring me so much joy and hope for my own self through your content! I cannot express my gratitude enough!
IS IT MY SECOND BIRTHDAY OR WHAT?
so happy for you!!!
congrats!
ILY
Appreciate the “controversial opinion” people really shouldn’t be shamed for sticking around with their parents if it helps them save and all. That’s extra time I know I won’t regret
13:02 Everyone deserves a house actually, including you
The first few times I read the title it read as "I BOUGHT A HORSE" I am a dumbass
SO HAPPY FOR YOU💖💖💖💖💖
I thought I was the only one who was deathly afraid of debt, which is why I didn't go to college. I am dedicated now in working on what I am passionate about, and seeing you be able to get a house reassures me. I am close to being able to get my car too, and that gets me excited.
The genuine happiness in this video makes me want to cry! So happy for you! ❤️
You do deserve this!
omg... totally thought the title said "HORSE" not "HOUSE" and I was all ejfbi;ewbf;iw3rgfbli3bfi43rfb WHAT?!?!?!!?
Yay! Congratulations on all your success girl!
I’m so excited for you!!!!!!
congrats!!! seeing you happy makes me soo happy!!!!!
I LITERALLY ALMOST TOOK MY NEIGHBOUR'S CHICKEN AND DANCE AROUND WITH IT, IM SO PROUD OF YOU MICARAH!!! 😭😭😭
That is such a pretty house!!!
Congratulations love! You deserve the world! Cant wait for more videos in your new abode as Garian flies about 🥰
So excited for you! You deserve all good things!
Congrats Mariah
If people actually came to your dad’s house, I’m sorry. That’s kinda scary.
Congrats on the house, you absolutely deserve everything you have. And thanks @glamnetics for the sponsorship hopefully helped with the down payment or at least furniture
Congrats. It’s beautiful. Also I think it‘s huge 😲
Low key jelause
You can put a desk in the closet in tour closet and make it a little cute nook
I AM SO HAPPY FOR YOU, YOU DESERVE EVERYTHING IN LIFE GODDESS ❤️ xx
her happiness makes me so freakin happy micarah you deserve everything
if you try to find and go to micarah's house, get some help...
🥲
You DO deserve the house. You worked hard to get it. Being a youtuber is a real job. I'm very proud of you!
I am so happy for you, the pure joy on your face was just so wholesome!❤️💕
I’m so happy for Micarah! Her house looks so cool! 😊
Ah I thought she would always stay in the RV
but why don't you believe in sidewalks?
I have a fear of debt and clowns!!!
CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Congratulations! I’m so happy for you, the house is exactly the kind of house I would think you’d buy. It’s so cute.
That house is really pretty tho
That tiny old tv in the wall would have sold me too!
"...I recite my self affirmations" "I don't believe in sidewalks" honestly same  I'm hoping to buy a house in the next year or so, and I'm really excited to do so at 24/25. I'll have a mortgage, but relatively low (and no other debt, I was privileged to get good enough grades I don't have college debt!), and I know it will be so good for my growth as a person. CONGRATS!!
It’s gorgeoussssss love the columns
She’s so awesome I even considering buying those eyelashes
I’m so happy for you girl!!!! 🥺❤️
I think the creepy one's are the people who disliked the video 😅😅😂😂 so happy for you🤗 your home is wonderful
Congratulations! I'm glad you're so happy. : )

Semivow Noun A vow but I won't get *as* angry at you if you break it.
how many ariana grande dresses can you fit in there 😩
this actually made my day <3 im so happy for you micarah!
Crying while watching this because I found out today that I *cannot* buy a house.
I wish I had been able to stay at home until I could afford a house! We wanted a house and put an offer in and it went for 100k over what our offer was, and what we could afford. Congratulations on yours! You deserve it!
Thats was very cute 🥰 hope you have all the best moments over there 🤩
When she mentioned about her father offering her scrambled eggs it reminded me of my mom's habit of asking if I wanted a bottle of water when she checked up on me.
congratulations sis!
You deserve all this and more :)
Congratulations Micarahhhhh❤️
IDC I drink cake 🤣
I’ve been waiting for this to happen cuz i wanna see the makeover
It's amazing how life can go so well for a young woman when she's raised with a loving dad who made it a point to be involved in her life. Now don't mess it up by getting involved with the wrong guy. Keep your standards high.
Beautiful house! So gorgeous. I just moved out too after years of saving. Thanks so much for sharing and as always love the editing! You Rock :D
Congratulations dude you deserve this!!!!
i don’t believe in sidewalks
*furiously googles “bleep street, Ohio”*

Congratulations on the new house!🌟
I am so happy for you!!!
Love It! Im so Happy for you... I had the same reaction when i chose my home 🥰
I think you deserve it <3
Would you be able to move the embedded text higher up in the video so it isn't illegible and hidden behind the subtitles for those of us who use them? The text above the head is great, but below it tends to be not great. A tad higher and it would be perfect!
How exciting! Congratulations!
Bruh her vids are funny af. And this is the only channel  I will watch that has sponcers that aren't boring
fun fact! construction on the titanic began in 1909, took 3 years to build and set sail and sank on its maiden voyage in 1912
Omg!! Congratulations I'm so happy for you 😄😆😆
I LOVE THAT HOUSE AKDKAKDJAJDJDJ- just needs more pink and old suff (im my opinion)
CONGRATULATIONS AND WELCOME HOME
I'm happy for this lady right here in this video...so so happy. ❤
You absolutely deserve this
Brands need to pay her more for sponsorships just because her endorsements are so entertaining people will actually watch them 😅
I'm very happy for you!!! Good things are coming your way
Omg!!!! You have to show us how you decorate every room!!!!! I absolutly love seeing videos about home interior!!! And your house is so pretty so I can't even imagine what you're going to do to elevate it more!!
The way micarah talks is soo ADHD... And I couldn't relate more
can you make Katniss’s wedding dress from the Hungar Games? btw love ur videos :)  like so micarah can see 👇🏼
My horse (you know, the one I TOTALLY don't deserve) whinnied right as you stretched out in a patch of sun... I seriously thought it was in the video. 😆
I'm also scared of mortgage, that's why I live in a 100 years old school on the Swedish countryside. 3 years in, still no ghost... I think...
micarah, WE bought a house. we are also remodeling our new house we all live here thank tou
Ahh I'm so proud of youu!!💕💕 you better frolic around that housee!!!!
girl, being afraid of debt is a good thing. Don't shame yourself for being smart!!!!

I am so so sorry that people are being stupid rude and creeping. That's awful. But you got a house! 🏡💕 That's awesome! Do be careful though. If Your pink rv might be visible, and I'm just worried, I'm worrying now. Please be careful. Don't put yourself in danger for our entertainment. Not in this way anyways.

that's such a pretty house, i'm so proud of micarah 😭
I KNEW IT! Congratulations Micarah! So happy for you! My husband and I are young and trying to buy our first house right now and this gives me hope! 🥳❤️ Do people seriously stalk you like that?! I can’t tell if you’re joking. If you’re serious, I am so sorry. That’s an awful thing to go through and I earnestly pray to our Father in heaven that it stops. ❤️
Awwww. Congratulations! That is so cool! Be happy.
AAAAAHH congrats Micarah!! You seem so happy! I too wish to buy myself a house one day, but you getting yours was really fun to see! Btw Garian is so freaking cute
I LOVE U YAY
you are the cutest gal in the world and you deserve all the blessings!!!!!
YAYYY FINALLY!
Is it just me or do I click soo fast when Micarah Posts. NO matter what the title is... :)
Congratulations  You bought a house
Congratulations!! I hope you fill your house with much love and joy. I doubt you’ll see this message, but it doesn’t matter. Wow I just had a massive blast of deja vu about this entire video and situation. Oh ok it’s passing. That was weird. Anyway, congrats on the house!       ~ Me
omg ti cant wait for house decoration videos :o
Ahh congrats Micarah!!! I can’t wait to see what you do to the place <3
Congratulations!
Congratulations Micarah! You may think you're a scatter brained, uneducated, undeserving young woman, but none of us view you through those dark lenses.  I'm a mom.  I have kids who have some friends who are "put together", college educated, and think the world owes them every bright shiny new thing on the market.  Your fear of debt, your ability to make magic out of thin air, your sparkly personality and your continued commitment to make a life for yourself by doing what you love puts you far ahead of many others your age. Keep creating, keep reaching, keep safe, and by all means keep sewing! ;-).
girl you may be 10 years older then me and I may have never met you but GOD DAMN,  I FEEL LIKE A PROUD MOTHER  WHO'S LOOKING AT THEIR HAPPY CHILD!
i watched the entire promotion edit: thinking about getting those lashes ngl
I'm sad you didn't buy an old house with a tower for the sheer fact that you could've called it "Micarah's Tower." But still, YOU ARE THRIVING AND I AM LIVING FOR IT. And I'm sorry for any creepers and I'm glad you're safe and cozy and home.
You deserve it!!!!!!
They better have paid you so much for that advertisement! Not even going to lie I don't even wear lashes but you totally sold them and in a very entertaining way!😂😂
video: watched smile: on my face
Congratulations!!!! I feel like i'm happy with you!!! ♥ I very much idintify myself with you ♥ but I don't sew, now have a pet/son bird.... and I Most Definetly honestly don't have a father so we're very different, but I feel like I can Relate to you :3 YAY Congrats...
I hope she will be painting the whole thing pink because I desperately need the serotonin!!
You are so deserving of this ❤️
Owwwww congrats!!! I'm so happy for you 🥺💜💜💜💜🥺
im soo happy for you! :)) Legit fan here! :))
Congrats! I'm so happy for you!
So happy for you!
I am so, so happy for you!
Congratulations on the house.❤️
make a dress from that spare carpet
I'm so proud of her tho
...putting costumes on roadkill
I think she has a house.
Being wary of debt is actually extremely rational and I share this sentiment with you. Congrats on your house!
Congratulations!! I always look forward to your videos, because I never know what to expect. You're absolutely hilarious! 😂😂😂
She’s that classic Taurus combination; materialistic yet cheap
ccooonngrats <3 and make a gorgeous grand ball with your loved one - and loved jokes too- AND REC THE WHOLE THING PLIS
Yay! Congratulations 🎉 That is so great! If me procrastinating by being entertained by you gets you a house, it's a win win situation!
This video makes me emotional. She's come so far. Owning a home is a pipe dream for me, much less in my 20s!
I am very happy for you!!! 💖💖💖💖💖
Yay! I’m so proud of you! The house looks gorgeous and it totally fits your personality. Are you going to name your house? Can’t wait for all of your chaotic interior design diys😁
FINALLY
Exactly 14 minutes! 👍🏻
Congratulations 🎉🎉🎉✨ you are such a light in this world. Thank you for entertaining us❤❤
Omg your house is so cute
👏👏👏
You trully deserve it!
"I don't deserve this" the absolute LIES. YOU DESERVE THIS AND YOU WORKED FOR IT!!!! You got this B^]
girl of course you did
Zillow is the first type of social media I check when I wake up 😆they email me at 6am every day for some reason
Can't believe you bought a house!
Micarah is one of those rare people that look just as good with eyeliner as she does without it
it's so good to see genuinely good and chaotic entities doing well in life
Micarah's reaction to having a house reminds me of like when you get to see a person you love or a pet you love a ton and you're just beaming with good vibes and love. She fr loves this house , and she totally does deserve it omg
so happy for youuu!! 💗💗
so happy for you !!! 😭😭
omg this is epic!
im so proud of u micarah :,) !! u deserve the best <3
Very congratulations!
congratulations!!!!
I didnt realize people were confused , it came off pretty obvious considering you were running out of space! anyways congrats on the house!
I’m so happy for her omg 😭
Congratulations Micarah!!! 🎉💖😱
YAYYYY congrats! Now you have more space for your ever-growing fabric collection
Here I am trying to escape ohio lmao
"You believe in reincarnation? No but they might" I'm crying😂

RIP OUT THEM CARPETS GIRL
Congratulations!
So proud of you! Living my adult dreams through you lol
Omg it’s so beautiful what the heck 🥺
Very happy for you. I love your quirkiness and how funny you are. You said that you didn't deserve this. But how wrong you are. You deserve everything good thing in life. You're a wonderful person and you entertain all of your subscribers and make them laugh.  Although your letter did make me teary eyed. You keep on going honey. I believe you are so blessed with a talent that is infectious to others. Making them laugh of course.  Also, your sewing abilities as well (lol). Enjoy your new home honey!
Make sure it's not haunted.
Pretty sure I'm in love with Micarah.
You deserve it sweetie! Happy to see you happy
She thanked me personally. Sorry other pleebs.
Congrats@!!!!!
One day I'll have mine too 🥲
Omg congrats
WHEN SHE WAS READIN THE LETTER TO THE OWNERS AND THE BIRD WAS THERE :D 🥰🥰🥺🥺🥺
IM EARLLY i think
This is what happens when you don't get raised by narcissists. Your creativity and trust in yourself is never destroyed
idk why but i felt like i got a house and now i am sad cause i actually dont have a house:'-(
Congratulations!!! 🥳 Your house is already looking very charming🥰
Congrats!!! who else is so happy for her??? she absolutely deserves this!
Congratulations, you deserve it 👏🏽
your house is so pretty! congrats!! :D
Congratulations, may your tea parties be the talk of Ohio!
Wait was someone actually stalkering her??!?
OMG Congratulations!!! I got my house when I was 29 through the USDA Rural Development program, and that first walk in when I actually OWNED it was one of the best moments of my life! So, hurrah and hooray and I'm happy for you!  That said... I'm sorry people are creeping on you, and you might remember that you can look up who owns what property pretty easily, so I would invest in cameras everywhere and possibly a security system.
WE’RE CRYING OF HAPPINESS FOR U😭❤️🥺
I can't believe people were stalking and harassing her 😔
The fact that some people are stalking her... I feel like even some of those sneak peaks could help them get to the house if the pictures of the house are still laying around on some random house buying website.
You have a Harry Potter room?! So fluffing jealous!!!
So so happy for you!! 😭💕
i neither belive in sidewalks.
I'm so happy for you!!!!❤
I'm so envious of you. I hope I'll have my own place someday so I can live in peace  without worrying about my abusive psycho family. You deserve all the best things Micarah. Enjoy your house.
so adorable
I am so excited for her!! It made me so happy to see her so happy haha🤣 And I was reminded of my own goal to own a house someday with no mortgage!!
Ohhh congrats Micarah!! You absolutely deserve it, don’t ever doubt that! Love your videos
that hand.. just had to think of taco flavored kisses
Happy International Women's Day Micarah!  In other words,  awesome timing for your video!
I'm so happy for you!! The house is beautiful and I can't wait to see videos of your regency tea parties!
I am so happy for you! You have a beautiful home ❤❤❤
Just got onto youtube  saw thumbnail  forgot about life and clicked

I’m so happy for you Micarah, you deserve all the success you have, you’re my favorite YouTuber ♥️
Her ad was hilarious loll
Wow! I can’t believe that was the non-selling point, you can always add a bathroom! 😆 Congrats on your new home!
ZILLOW ADDICTION IS NOT A JOKE, JIM

Thinking that my subscription was somehow a tiny part of this makes me so happy - congrats!!! 😁❣
Micarah you deserve all of this! You’re a Disney Princess with actual Talent!!
5:44 excuse me???? People please stop stalking you tubers. That’s absolutely terrifying and disgusting
Please give me the numbers of the stalkers. I JUST WANNA TALK *agressively cracks knuckles*
Congrats. Now I feel obligated to sit though the mobile game ads
They don't pay you enough for their sponsorship!!!!!!
YOU DESERVE THIS BB!! I love seeing how happy you are ☺️💕
Your so talented! You deserve this I’m so happy for you!
So happy for you !! You deserve it. Just because your work isn't some classic desk job doesn't mean you didn't do hardwork to achieve that !
You are such an inspiration! I love your content! Also YES Zillow is so addictive!❤❤
OMG
I’m 16 and I absolutely love Zillow. I have so many houses saved like I’m gonna buy one anytime soon😭
why am i so happy for a yter who just got a house? Idk but YES GIRL YOU FO GIRL WOOOO
maybe I’m just on the brink of a mental breakdown but the little “you make me happy” at the end made me cry. congratulations micarah, you deserve this so so much!! xxx
U being happy makes me happy
YOU DO DESERVE THIS!! all love, enjoy your new house <3
I am not creepy one invite me😁
Congrats!!
This is amazing, but let's not forget that everyone should be able to have a house that gives them this much joy. Affordable, nice housing should be a right imho. But congrats anyway  Micarah, it's brilliant news!!!!
This issue sweet and wholesome
Oooooo she got money!!!! 👑😩
Congrats Micarah! Cant wait for regency gathering videos! Those columns will be perfect
5:43. Wow, I didn’t know she had stalkers and how serious they were.
Wait wait wait , you do deserve this ma’am it’s not OUR fault people our age can’t normally afford houses! You worked hard and you should never discredit that
Omgosh I love you so much God loves you
Congratulations!!!!! You so deserve it💖
Congratss! And you absolutely do deserve it, that's a beautiful house
So so happy for you! Your deserve it!
IM SO EXCITED LIKE U FINALLY BOUGHT A HOUSE EEEEEE
awwwww
I'm so happy for you. Congrats you home owner
heyyy , not the creepy one, i m so happy for you:)
Micarah I hope you're happy with my naive ass who didn't actually know why you were in that house at the end of last video. You successfully kept the secret from 1 person
girl I'm soo afraid of debt too, I know exactly what you mean!
she can draw better on her hand than i can do on paper
Congrats on your new (old), lovely home! Also your fear of debt is not that irrational; student loans suck, so more power to you for avoiding debt!
I'm so glad that finally someone said it's okay to live with your parents!!! I'm mideastern and it's very common for you stay to with your parents and it's very rare to leave your parents house unless you like get married or something like that but I agree with you wholeheartedly micarah!!! Thank you for saying this!💖💖💖💖
Yay! Congratulations!
YESSSS IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU BESTIE!!!
Yay! I am sooo happy for you! I love your videos, they are so entertaining and educational at the same time! You are one of the best YouTubers ever! :) lastly, you are sooo pretty, and I am sooo surprised you don’t have 1000 people wanting to be your sponsor because unlike other videos I actually watch your “commercials”. And please keep us posted with all the projects you do on your house just like you did with your RV, I would really enjoy that and I think other people would too! Great job, and you should be sooo proud of yourself and everything you accomplished!!!!!! 😊❤️
Oh my gosh... how wonders for you!! Congrats!!
AWSOME to see your success 💕👏
This is the most wholesome and exciting “I bought a house” video on YouTube.  ALSO, when you were rollerblading through an empty house last video, the idea of you buying a house was the last thing I would’ve thought. Tbh, I kind of just thought you wandered your way into some abandoned home. No bs haha
This might be paranoid much, but you did show a bit of the front of your house and It'd be awful if you got stalked by creeps again-
Congrats on the house! Thank you for being so entertaining ☺ every video you upload is like a gift.
Your eyelashes look so goooood
High five hun 🥂 I'm currently saving for a house it feels like it's going to take forever!
record yourself decorating each room.  one room per video. that would be pretty entertaining.
I'm late nooooo
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWW
I appreciate your videos so much! Thank you!!!
Find someone who loves you as much as Micarah loves her house.  (just-kidding-love-is-a-verb-go-spread-love-and-joy-to-others-and-you-will-recieve-it-in-return-thank-you-have-a-good-day-don't-believe-in-sidewalks)
Congrats on the house!!!!
Congratulations on your new home!!!
I'm so happy for you!!!
Yay! Congrats Micarah!🙌
She is so happy..
This is adorable. I am someone also terrified of debt and I have been lucky enough to still go to university and stay out of debt. I always imagined after finishing school I would go travel Europe since I'm a language major and all but seeing this maybe I'll stay home and save up for a house... I am really scared of becoming an adult because I don't feel like I know what I'm doing but seeing your joy over your house makes adulting look a lot more exciting. So thank you :)
You are so funny! Thank you for making these videos!<3
I'm not quite sure but....I think she's excited
It’s not illegal to draw on money
Congratulations now make a house inspired dress 👗
Me when I have been at a friends house and I get home
kinda feel bad for Dad Tewers coz he's gonna be living alone now
4:36 I've never seen such a nice big-8 pool table on a wall before...
yeeeeeees so happy for you, of course you deserve this
Congrats!!! You’re so cute and there’s so much room for you to create, be inspired, and grow! Can’t wait to see what you do next. Thanks for sharing with us
I’m so happy for you
Sorry about the creepers and congrats on the house
Can you give me the names of the creepers that found your house? I just wanna...talk. I’m so happy for you the house is perfect!!!!
Congrats!!!
Ma’am??? You DO deserve it! We’re all here watching your ads and using your discount codes because you’re you and we want you to own mansionS. You’re wholesome and hilarious and  ✨ u n i q u e ✨   Yes a lot of people your age don’t get to buy their dream home, but that has nothing to do with your fate. Keep being you!!
I love your Lucifer reference
Congratulations
Oh my goodness!!!
I mean it honestly didn't occur to me that you had bought a house in the last video. I just thought you found an empty house and went inside to take pictures. It seemed in character.
I wish there was more of people like you in the world! you absolutely deserve it! God bless you!!  P.S: I feel we would be best friends in real life. XOXO
You're an adult now!!!
Just realized my face hurt from smiling so much through this video. So happy for your accomplishments!
I freaking Screech when I saw that clown *shudder*
oh YOU SO DESERVE THIS MICARAH  i’m happy for u my queen
Congrats! can't wait to see the makeover videos!
aaa, im so excited for you and this new chapter of your life :)
Bruh. I will add you to my Disney+ account. Piracy isn’t a victimless crime. (I hope you remember or know to what I’m referring🤣)
The most amazing house tour I've ever seen!
OKAYYYYY QUEEENNN (not me getting notified of the upload 2 hours after)
Your ads are just so entertaining, and you hit the important points.
I just had a dream about you the other night! We were stealing from Legoland ( a theme park in UK idk if you have them in America)
YESSSS MICARAH PERIIOOODDTT
YESSSSSSSSSSS
I’m happy crying
You totally deserve this. I am in shock by the amount of work that it must a e taken to shoot and edit this video. Girl you are skilled and you deserve every good thing that comes your way. I have up next to my sewing machine because I am sewing but you inspired so much in me to want to see and I am so grateful for that so I am happy for you. P.s you are a great writer, this video is well written.
ahhh congrats!!!
montage is the best thing i've seen in weeks :') micarahs happiness is that infectious !!
I was so happy, i felt like I just bought a house too. Lmao I’m so happy for you congrats ❤️🏡
SHE IS SUCH A PRECIOUS LIL CHAOS <3 BUT ON A SIDE NOTE, PLEASE HAVE SOME FORM OF SECURITY FUNCTION IN UR HOUSE, KINDA WORRIED THAT THERE REALLY ARE CREEPS OUT THERE FOLLOWING U :((
Congratulations on your new home! And thanks for including that blurb about Americans and their weird societal pressures requiring everyone over 18 to move out of their parents' home.
Yaassss congrats girlfriend!! You deserve every blessing that comes your way! ❤️❤️❤️
aww congrats ! so happy for you :) !!
Congrats🥳 I'm so proud of you💫💜💜
THIS. This is my favourite video of yours. You ar so pure and niice and lovely.
Am I the only one who feels like she’s a female version of Garrett Watts? Like her personality? I love it
Congratulations! So happy for you! ❤️❤️❤️
After 8 years we are finally ready to put our house on the market and find our dream home. This gave me all the feels! You deserve all the happiness you Hilarious ball of light and love.
Proud of you as a fan!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ I’m so happy for you Micarah ☺️☺️
I’m so happy for her!!!
Im so so soooo happy for you!! And PROUD 😭💖💖 seeing how happy you are made me happy!! Please stay safe and do whatever makes you happy ✨💖💖
now I wanna buy a house.
The montage in the end was so wholesome🥺❤️
please...the roadkill story, be fake...
You make others happy by yourself being happy
I’m so happy for you~ but as someone who only has one bathroom. Good luck. It is fine by yourself, but the moment you have company and two people have to pee....you are in trouble.
The way you keep making me want to spend money. 😭 First the wigs and now the lashes and nails....I'M BROKE I CANNOT AFFORD THIS. XD
Congratulations you deserve this and much more never say you don’t deserve it you are amazing!!!
Yay this is so cool!
You’re so beautiful and pure and amazing and deserve everything good in the world 🥰 so happy for you !!!
Yay! I don't care what you say, you DO deserve it! I smiled the whole time during this video because I was so happy for you :)
I'm so happy for you Micarah, you deserve this and much more! Enjoy every moment of it, you worked really hard for it 💖
My godddd congrats!!
Was having a pretty shitty pre-birthday day but this melted my heart. YOU GO MICARAH!
I AM SOOO HAPPY FOR YOU!! it looks like such a beautiful and you 100% deserve it!
So happy for you!
That house looks so amazing!
11:37 disney princess moment
i literally thought it said you bought a horse at first until i was 30 seconds into the video
Oh darlin', you DO deserve this. You deserve all things good and happy. Never doubt it. CONGRATULATIONS!!
SO happy for you girl!
Well, this was just the sweetest video ever. Congratulations Micarah xx
congratulations :)
aw you look so happy you deserve it!!!!
Congratulations on your beautiful new home!  You ABSOLUTELY deserve it.  (p.s. THANKS for that regency dress tutorial, you saved my butt!  And yeah, that's a huge-butt neckline )
Congratulations, Micarah. ❤
absolutely amazing! she deserves this house — a place where she can feel safe, explode with creativity, and feel like home!
My lifegoal is complete  0:13  I'm so exited for you🤗
You know what this means right? HOUSE TOUR AND DECOR!!!!
was that a five minute ad read
But does the house have hidden wheels that allow it to travel ?
its so nice to see you so happy, and you do deserve that house:)
¡¿¡What freaking planet did you come from!?! 😂😂😂😂😂  Congrats on the house btw, you are glowing 🥰
What i did NOT expected was the CUTENESS!!! What a wholesome video
A house
brb im just gonna cry because ill probably be renting until im in my 40s at least im happy for her
Omg congrats!!! Ur actually Barbie now and you deserve it!!! 💖
Congrats Micarah!!! I'm so excited for you!
I love your personality....
So exciting!!! Also, did I hear her say that she doesn't have a mortgage? Way to go!
Don't stalk Micarah.
YOOO CONGRATULATIONS!!!
When it’s Micarah I don’t even mind watching an ad.
Congratulations on getting your own house 😊 Much Love 💖
YOU FINALLY BOUGHT A HOUSE
Omigosh OMIGOSH OMIGOSH CONGRATSSSS...you're neighbors are in for some fun lol ❣❤💕💕💞😂😂
Hooray!!! Congratulations!!! 🥳🎉😄❤️
Don't let this economy fool you into feeling guilty! You absolutely deserve this house and we all couldn't be happier for you :)
It's beautiful! Congrats!!  That sucks you're being stalked, I had to move twice because of someone heavily stalking me; once in college when I was about 20, the guy would approach my roommates about coming in the house, the second when I was 22, he'd follow me home from work and ask if I wanted to ride, I'd refuse, and his truck would be parked across the street by the time I'd get home. It was soo scary, sorry you're dealing with creepy people. Stay safe!
Who else almost got excited as Micarah was, and was just filled with excitement?  p.s I love your videos your so funny and bubbly and very talented
Oh honey no....
Omg congratulations!! I’m so happy for you!
Your dad is named Mark William too?? Wow so is mine! Nifty!
*I thought this was a clickbait*
congrats!! love the house:)
I find it really sad that you guys in the states need to choose between debt and a college education... but I guess it leads to people finding other ways to reach success like you did, you're such an inspiration!
oMg YAESSSSS
CONGRATS!!!!! I called it! Wooooooo🥳🥳🥳🥳🤩🤩🤩🤩
YOU DESERVE THE WORLD GUURRRL
Your house is beautiful and I can’t wait to see all the wonderful things you will do and make in it. I am so happy for you! You absolutely deserve this! <3
This is so wholesome! Congrats on the new house Micarah! Will you be putting a framed painting of La'Trexa somewhere?  Hopefully the harassers will learn they're being too creepy :/ no one deserves getting harassed
You deserve it Micarah ! Congrats 😍
I wish I could meet you! Ahah we would have a grand regency tea party indeed. 🤣
You deserve it!! You are so talented!
wow... you KNOW you have money when you can buy TWO RVs AND a "victorian home"! Also I LOVE it
Guys I think Micarah got a house
CONGRATS!!!!!!!!
Hoooow is it even entertaining to watch Micarah promoting these eyelashes?! WTF
Dude where in the world do you get a couch that nice for 40$, also how did you get a house that big for so little, I'm from the state that doesn't exist and houses here are like 130,000$ just for a one bed one bath apartment and I live in the middle of knowhere.
YAY SO HAPPY FOR YOU!  Don’t feel bad for your hard work!
A DEER IN A WIG JAJAJAJAJA
Taht is the most beautiful house I have ever seen it is GORGEOUS😍
i'm so happy for you
I am so proud of you!!!
CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!
This video makes my soul hurt 🥺💕💕💕💕💕
I have never laughed this hard on an ad before
CONGRATULATIONS
:0
This house is literally so perfect
CONGRATS
Hey, Micarah!  I have to say that you ABSOLUTELY deserve to have your dream house and the happiness it brings you! I've been subscribed to you since you made that prom dress 2 years ago and I stayed because your personality and genuine excitement brought me happiness and comfort in tough times. There never once was a video that I didn't enjoy! I have never met you but I have no doubt that you are the most amazing person! I really hope you'll be happy in your new home and please don't think that you're not worth it. Also please stay safe and be careful. All the love <3
That looks like an Awesome house, I’m jealous. Congratulations!!!
Yay!!!
Congratulations lovely lady!!!
I'm so excited for the makeover/renovation videos to come!! :D
Congratulations!! That is a huge accomplishment and you should be very proud of yourself! I can't wait to watch you make it yours!
PLEASE do a room with Mr. Kate!!
Can we talk about how well trained garreon is?? Like for someone who wasn’t planning on getting a bird Micarah did a great job in my opinion
You should have a room full of manequins wearing the biggest gowns you've made!!
Im so sorry to hear about those creeps. Congratulations on your new home! You're Epic!
I was not expecting that last part lol
thank god i'm not the only one with a life-ruining addiction to zillow
I'm so proud of you! seeing you smile so big makes my day! i hope you are very veryyy happy with it and can't wait for the transformation that's to come!
Wow! Congratulations!🥳🥳🥳🥳
AHH congrats
So happy! Hope you enjoy so f much! Hope I get that feeling one day, it is my dream. A place to call home
I’m so happy for you! You radiate light and good energy and I’m so happy you found the one! Wishing you many happy memories in your new space. You’re awesome
I'm crying.. Micarah, you deserve this! <3
I am genuinely happy for youuu!
This was the sweetest thing ever! So happy for you! Congratulations!!!
I, too, have a crippling fear of debt. Unfortunately, practicing engineering without going to college is “frowned upon” and, in some states, “illegal”.
I am so happy for you Micarah, you are one of those hardworking influencers that I would venture to say that you 100% deserve every positive thing that comes your way. I hope the best for you and I'm so happy my fave is thriving.
You absolutely deserve it Micarah. Congratulations 👏
Congratulations! But also... That moment when she's talking about clowns and an ad for the Ronald McDonald foundation started...
I’m just engaging with this video because the sheer joy on your face when you said YouTube is making your dreams come true made me feel all warm inside!
i am soooooo happy for you Micarah, congratulations on your new house!! it already looks great xx
Congrats on finding your home - what a beautiful place!
Three cheers for Micarah!!!! I'm so happy for you! Cant wait to see how you end up decorating your new home!
That’s so cool that she got a house! Happy for you, Micarah! ❤️
i could literally feel your joy through the screen
Aww she makes me so happy! Congrats Micarah! Enjoy your new home ❤️
Micarah has an incredible ability to make every single second of her videos extremely entertaining.  I'm so happy that I discovered her channel last year - best videos on YouTube.  So proud of you, Micarah!! <3  Also, the thumbnail is gorgeous.
Wish I was Barbie's neighbour
Your house is soo pretty 😍
Real mink lashes or faux?? :(
This is equal parts funny and wholesome to the point that it literally made my day
I'm so happy for you!
But also ✨filming space✨
You deserve nothing less.
why?
Zillow is soooo addictive
so proud 💕
So happy for you!! Also, I'm totally obsessed with your shoes, they're too cute!!
Nooooo I'm 2 hours late😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Amazing! so happy for you
IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU🥰🥰
Aaaaaahh!! You are literally who I aspire to be! I’m 18 trying to get my life going. Buying a car, going to school, working etc. Sometimes I feel like I should be moving out already but this video was really encouraging. You are freakin amazing!!!
I'm really happy for the all the opportunities and achievements you've got so far girl! Might be a way of coping with my own fear of mediocrity or smthing, but I'm really happy for you! Congrats!!
Do magnetic lashes work for idiots who can't do lashes though? Also I wish I'd get an invite to a regency tea party 😂 3rdly, try hanging extra long curtains over short windows and hanging different curtains on the outside than the inside to avoid stalkers.
I’m so happy for you! I’m excited to see what you do with this lovely house!
I’m so happy for you
u deserve it, we love u sm and thank u for making us smile
Your house is beautiful 💜💜💜💜 Im so happy for you and thanks for the invitation when I go visit I wanna stay at harry potter's room, cant wait to see new vids in there
I am sooooooooooooo happy you got a new house ahhhhh lov it
I'm so sorry that you had to deal with safety issues! And just to mention, please blur out or close the blinds to the windows when filming because people can be absolutely crazy and try to find the home through the street view/etc. Best of luck in your new home! It looks absolutely beautiful!
sigh. *opens zillow*
I am so happy for you, i hope you make a sewing room, that is my dream
Can I drink cake too 😩
Ok, but why is your mind SO big?! The editing is so creative.
oh baby you totally deserve this and much much more!!!
Congratulations!! Totally deserved imo,your videos are incredible. Im somewhat nervous about how much you've shown based on how creepy people have been to other people I watch though
This is so exciting!!! Im so happy for you!!!
No More van????
Congratz on your purchase ! This house seems perfect for you.  The look on Micarah's dad's face when she's reading the letter to the estate agent is so sweet and tender, I just can't have enough.
I am so genuinely happy for you 💚
I watched the whole ad segment without realizing it  :)))) very entertaining
MICARAH YOU DESERVE THIS YOU SWEET SUNSHINE BABY
YES ROOM MAKEOVER VIDEOS HERE I COME ~jk please don't feel obligated to do any videos you don't wanna do~
im so jealous :< watching this from a homeless shelter in scotland, happy for you micarah!
Ur so adorable
One day, you'll live both of our dreams, hosting a Regency tea party Edit: will one of the rooms be for your chickens?
What? I thought the title said "I bought a horse"
this is who i want to grow up to be-
I am so happy for you! Congratulations!
In the Armenian culture its encouraged and sometimes even frowned upon for kids to move out before marriage. Before anyone says that's outdated... you can move out for college or in general if you want to its not a law. But I did move back in with my parents after college and then moved out once I got married. this allows you to work and save up because of your limited financial responsibilities (house rent or bills...) and once you are ready to move out you have a big chunk of saving there to help you. I wish everyone could have that opportunity. because it does keep you financially stable and mentally healthy (if your family is your support system) all things we could use.
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH AND IM SO EXCITED FOR YOU!
I'm so excited about your new house but also kinda heartbroken that you were being stalked at your last house. That's so disappointing and I hope Dad Tewers doesn't have to deal with that :(
Holy fuck you crack me up!
This is so crazy how far you've come I've been here since like 100k and now you have bought a house :o
Wow I wish you were my neighbor
So happy for you you worked hard for it!!!
Nah girl you truly deserve this and we couldn’t be happier for you! Congrats on owning your dream house 🎉 (with your two RVs and very own dream house you’re now officially a Barbie <3)
I will now be waiting on a video in the future about how to host a regency tea party (post covid)
i'm so happy for you!! (also very jealous)
So proud and happy for you Micarah!!!
omg this video was a whole lotta ad. im glad it was funny at least. hustleeeeeeeee
It's exactly 14:00 minutes AGAIN! Great job micarah on timing it perfectly.
oh my god can you imagine how confused the tik tok algorithm must be trying to figure out what to show micarah
You deserve this - you worked hard on building your life as is and as a 33 y-o who's got over 40k in debt, I'mma say well done. You succeeded! Enjoy it and thanks for the all the fun content Micarah!
I’m sooo happy for you
I‘m so happy for you! 💕
How you do that thing with your pets were they follow you?

You did WHAT—
OMG!!!!!!!!!!! Congrats!
I wasn't prepared for this level of wholesomeness
I am so happy for you! You deserve this 💜
so happy for you
So when are you going to make the dress out of pistachios shells? I really want to see that!!!!
My dad is also constantly offering me eggs. It must be a dad thing.
Garrion coming at your call is the most wonderful thing I have ever seen.
You love to see it!! 🥺🥺💖💖
I’m so happy for you! The house looks so beautiful and elegant. Sorry to hear about the security problems you’ve been dealing with. I truly hope those creeps leave you be. Much love & happiness you! 💜
We are sooo happy for you
So happy for Ya! You deserve it ☺️🙌
congratulations!!!
I loved every second of this video!!
Your house is awesome and you deserve it. Congrats. P. S. I swear I'm not the creepy one
Im so sorry you have to hide your address because of creepy men.
I would watch micarah commercials for entertainment
Okay, so a couple things, first Micarah is sunshine and rainbows personified.  Her unabashed joy over her new house is more contagious then covid, and it's so wonderful to see someone so authentic and weird and simply happy.  Second, I am super jealous of that home, it is gorgeous and I can't wait for her to wear Victorian costumes and dance around that place so I can live vicariously through her.  Third, if you are one of the creeps that harassed her, you are a bad person and I hope you get arrested.  Long live personal safety!
Just wanted to say thank you for being your awesome self! I was having a bit of a rough start to the day, but your joy is crazy infectious! Consider me cheered up! And a huge congratulations to you on finding your dream home! Love from Canada~ 🧡
At 28 I'm about to get my first property. 25 acres, 2 houses, a barn, a huge garden and  a pond dude I'm so excited. My birthday is the 27th of this month and I'm hoping that we can start moving in on my birthday 🎉🎉
Aw im so happy for you girl!! Congrats!😊
This gurl has 3 houses woah! Love you MT
Congratulations dear❤
Hosting victorian and regency tea parties is also on my list of reasons to get a house! :')
Congrats!!!
This made my day.🤣😆🙃
Congratulations! I hope you make a series decorsting each room.
Congratulations!
so happy for you! if anyone deserves this it's you <3
I'm seeing my future when me and my husband actually buy a house. I guarantee my first time in the house after closing will be just as spastic as you, aww this got me really excited for house hunting once we move thanks for the positive vibes!
i'm so happy for her <3 she deserves everything
You definitely deserve this! From what we can see, you're an amazing human being! I hope you'll post more DIY decoration videos for all of us to enjoy!
Congratulations 🎊🍾
you’re literally the only youtuber I watch the hole video, sponsor and everything
IM SO HAPPY FOR U
I’m soooo excited for you
Aww I’m so happy for you!
Most hilarious woman on youtube. Got me to watch the entirety of a 3 minute ad.  *edit* I feel like I wasted my comment. I have some thoughts -Only Micarah can get away with putting a wig on a deer when the police come knocking -I hate that you've been stalked and followed. My sentiments. -A house you want to be able to...mutilate? -She can SUMMON Garion!?
Thank you sooooo much for sharing!  I work full time driving with Lyft. I always say I'm doing it for the down payment on a house. I don't care about the structure, I just want a yard I can get dirty in (garden) and keep a pooch happy in. Thank you for sharing!  Your paid promotions rock! I haven't performed in almost 20 years or coached/taught in 10. You got me thinking about updating my old pom squad performance dress code for the next coach that will NEVER ask me for it. I still have eyelash glue that old in my performance kaboodle. Your ads are THAT good.
This is the only channel where I dont skip the part when they talk about the sponsor because it just feels like it's a normal aspect of her vids
I Love it 💗
Micarah, if there’s one person who deserves a house it’s you, we all know how hard you work to give us fun content, we love you and CONGRATS! (Fun fact when I type your name my phone corrects it to Nicaraguan every time..)
You deserve it girl!!! 😘
My question is can I come to your Regency & Victorian Tea Parties?
Lashes AND nails? that's news to me
Does she rotate out the pillows and drapes so they always match her outfit? 🤔
I am so unbelievably happy for you!! Honestly, this video brought me so much vicarious joy!! Wishing you so much more success and happiness in the future 🥰❤️✨
Coolest barbie ever
so happy for you micarah!!!!!!!! can’t wait to see your imagination come to life even further in such an enriching space!
Micarah had me crying tears of joy for her. Congrats dude it’s Gorgeous
Happy Internation Women's Day!!
@Micarah Tewers, CAN YOU PLEASEEEE MAKE A VIDEO OF REVIEWING THE HAMILTON THE MUSICAL COSTUMES ON HISTORICAL ACCURACY?
She deserves the best
You ABSOLUTELY deserve this, congrats!!! Can't wait to see what you do with it!
Of all the youtuber I watch you Deserve this most. You literally put so much h hard work into every video. Congratulations. And I totally think you should make the "Harry Potter room" look like the "borrowers" live there & make a video of it. I know you know the "borrower's" movie from 1997.
You deserve this
I'm so happy for you
She’s the only YouTuber that I don’t skip the sponsorships for because she makes them so interesting
I CANT WAIT TO SEE VIDEOS OF THE REMODELING PROCESS AHHHHHHHH
I’m honestly so proud and amazed of how far she’s come 🙈❤️😌💅
Congrats!!! I’m excited to see what you do with it. You’ll have so much more room to create and dance with your mannequins!  Nobody has made me want those magnetic lashes before. You did. You have done the impossible.
CONGRATS  I’m on the market for one right now!
Ahhhhhh I’m so happy for you!!!!! You truly deserve it!!!!!! 💕💕💕💕
congrats 🎉
☺️✨I don't believe in sidewalks✨☺️
OMGGGG
this video made me grin several times <3
I wanna know how the glamnetics people react when they see your ads
pffft who cares that i have a test rn, Micarah bought a house that definitely more important
Congrats ❤️
Just got my own house last month and its been a month of cleaning and painting and peeling wallpaper.
I'm so so happy that by simply enjoying your videos I helped you to get this fantastic house 😊 Huzzah!
Idk why I read it as "I bought a horse" 😂😂 I was so excited and clicked. Wasn't disappointed either way though,I absolutely love your videos! Congratulations on your home!!
your genuine joy about this makes me so happy!!! <3 And you do deserve it. For signing with a bird on your shoulder alone.
YAAAY!!!!! I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU!!! It's so much fun renovating your own house and have your own routine and finally not having other ppl tell you wear to put your stuff
Omg yes a whole sewing room and closet so excited for you! Congrats!!!!!
CONGRATSS!!! I hope someday I can buy a house too or build one lol
That's the big news you were talking about!!?!!!
Micarah taking away the shame I feel for being a 30 yr old living with her mom in 30 seconds
AHHHHHH THE GIRL BOUGHT A HOUSEEEE
omg i have the shoes that u wear in the start of the video that’s so crasy >:D
Awww
Your ads are the only ones I watch, they are so entertaining!
Congradulation !!!!!!!!!!
“They’re just men who are insecure with normalcy” Me, a trans guy, in the middle of literally putting on my clown makeup after sewing another clown ruff because I’m obsessed with clowns because they’re a comfort to me: 🧍‍♂️
When I say I have literally never been so happy for someone ive never met before, I mean it. You look so happy and Im happy for you. You are my favorite youtuber, and im legitimately so proud you have come this far! Good luck with your brand new house!!!💖💖💖
Leave this beautiful angel alone you creeps. And you absolutely deserve this. You have no idea how much joy your content gives everyone, there is no price you can put on that.
It's so sad to hear my generation say we don't deserve homes. And just accept that as fact. Anyway you deserve this. Also, all people deserve a home.
HOW IS YOUR HOUSE BIGGER THAN MY HOUSE THAT 4 PEOPLE LIVE IN.
I figured house shopping.
I think you are fantastic and love your videos. I am so happy for you and hope you make lots of wonderful memories in your new home. Did we ever find out why you got the second RV?  BTW could you please not say SP****IC, it is really offensive to some people.
Right at the end when you said “I have a house” you can see how happy and excited and proud you are and you totally deserve! Love to see my favorite youtuber making moves!
Is it just me did no one notice she said one and a half people living there? Baby?
Did you just call your bird over like a living Snow White?
Congrats to my favvvvv 💞
i love your son T___T
But you do deserve this! Enjoy what yoy worked hard to achieve and give yohrself credit as well! We didnt hand you a house. We were just there along the way :)
she's so happy about her new house that i can't help but smile too ^^
Oh now I know why you keep on cutting your sentences...
Congratulations!!! This is so exciting! And you definitely deserve it, you have put so much work into this channel. Your videos are amazing ❤️❤️ (also please stay safe 😬😬)
Micarah I think I've been with you since like 75k subscribers and I am just SO PROUD OF YOU and so excited to see what you have in store!!!!!!
I’m happy for you! I’m currently looking for a house and it’s a nightmare in my city! (North of France) The struggle is real! Send me your good vibes!

Since Gerion was at the signing, that makes him part owner. 🦜
Okay but that was the best ad I’ve ever seen. Truly the only ads worth watching haha Congrats on the house!!
I drink cake..... I will use that
I’m so happy for her lmaooo
so happy that you feel happy with your house, and I would like to apologise that you felt the need to move because of creepy fans. Know that they are not the majority and that the rest of us love and respect you :D
love going through Zillow to look at rich houses I will never be able to afford
this made me emotional :') been here since the tear-away pants it's so great watching you grow! <3
Seeing you so so happy is so heartwarming, you deserve this!
Congratulations hun! Happy happy for you!

Omggg I'm so happy for you and honestly you look so happy and excited
I am really sorry to hear that people have been creepy.
OMG cool congrats on getting a house :D
Congrats Kiddo.  You are now, officially, more of an adult than I am. I'm assuming there's a vegetable/herb garden getting planned for the eventual 'post-covid costume drama gown back-yard BBQ' to be hosted in... - Cathy (&, accidently, Steve), Ottawa/Bytown
Congrats on the house!!! If you ever throw a Regency Party, which Bridgerton outfit would you go for?
The last seen though!?!? Yo you good ??
So wonderful congratulations!
Micarah on earthly foundations feels wrong
What do you mean you don’t deserve this ? It’s yours you deserve it you’ve worked for it :)
SO HAPPY FOR YOU!!!!
DONT EVER FOR A SECOND THINK YOU DONT DESERVE THIS. YOU DO. I LOVE U MIC STIX
The way Micarah is just so excited and happy to have a house ❤️❤️❤️
I freaking love you!!! Congratulations!!!!
I hope i will be able to be independent some day the way you are. It’s so much harder when you haven’t been to university
That's wonderful! Congrats Micarah!!
👍👍👍👍👍
I’m so excited for you!!!! Congratulations ✨✨
ive been waiting for this moment. congrats, try not to burn it down in the first few weeks.
The stairs of your new home looks tiny, maybe it's because of the angle of the photo, Congratulations, hope you make beautiful memories in your new home💖
YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE NEW WANDA MAXIMOFF OUTFITTT

I've always wanted a Victorian house BUT I CANT MOVE OUT

I’m so happy for her 🥺 Old houses have such beautiful architecture! I can’t wait to see how she decorates it! 💕
I WAS RIGHT?!??? Wow.
I love you Micarah❤️
I'm very happy for you! (also hope you stay safe, sorry for the creeps)
Very happy for you! ^^
Congratulations!!! It would be nice to make a video of you decorating your new home and giving it your personal style!
I read horse at first
I swear, brands should just hire you as their official ambassador already.  Your sponsorship skits live in my head rent free.  Also because there is nothing else in there.
Micarah is the 2nd popular youtuber I follow who has had to deal with creepy men. Bestdressed had to deal with them too and had to move apartments bc of it. I'm sorry the same thing is happening to you. :/
I don’t believe in sidewalks  Love you
You've earned it by giving us so much enjoyment! Bask in it and don't feel guilty :)
THOSE STAIRS
CONGRATS MICARAH! You deserve every single thing and more!
IM SO HAPOY SEEING YOU SO HAPPY OMG
Omg congratsss!!💛🥺
CONGRATS!!!! THIS HOUSE IS GORGEOUS
congrats on the new house! that’s awesome
Congratulations!!
Having someone slip notes under your door saying nasty things is reprehensible. Please install security. Not trying to scare you, I just don't want you to underestimate how crazy some people are.
Rebecca says: “I love your videos and I really want to make what you make.” Chloe says: “I’m happy for you, that you got your own house.” Rebecca says, “say that for me too.”  🎊🎈🎉Congratulations!  🎉🎈🎊
Yaaaaa you will have even more space to sew and stuff !!!!!!!!!!!! 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
Hey, Micarah, at the risk of sounding like an annoying PSA, please, please, invest in a good alarm system for your home. There are a lot of freaks and you are a single female living alone. Don’t take any risks. We love you too much.
i was just on zillow.. rip
Seeing Micarah happy  about her house is so heartwarming
You deserve this so much micarah you’ve brought so much joy to so many people

So happy for you! 😊
You need to sew a dress for the occasion..... maybe something someone would wear when they moved? Like a housewife or something? Idek but you are amazing!!!
Congratulations!!!! I am so happy for you. My parents bought a new house in 2019 and I think we all had the same kind of excitement that you have, so I can relate : )
Micarah! Open a PO box please! I wanna send u some buttons I found!
"I'm very particular about which laws I break." Haha mood

Yipppeeee
Thank you for continuing to be a youtuber who is not only family friendly but, a woman of grace, dignity, kindness and humor my preteen daughter can look up to.
Congratulations on your house! I bought my house in 2014 and it's amazing to finally live somewhere you own. Please don't forget to buy home owner's insurance. It's not mandatory if you don't have a mortgage but it's so important to have if, god forbid, something tragic happens. A few years after I bought my house we lost some roof shingles in a big storm and my hard wood floors got a serious amount of water dumped on them. My insurance paid for a new roof and helped get my floors back into good condition. Very recently my sister's pipes froze in Texas and a pipe over her master bathroom burst. Thankfully her bathroom is by an outside wall and the burst part of the pipe was facing that wall so the only room damaged was her bathroom. Her insurance is paying to help her get a brand new bathroom. Home ownership comes with unexpected expenses sometimes and if you don't have piles and piles of cash hanging around, home insurance is a good way to help with those expenses.
god ily queen i'm really happy for u, and dw, you deserved this!
What's a dippin' egg? Also do you need a roommate? I promise that I'm not one of the creepy ones. JK (on the roommate part not the creepy part) I'm not even from the same state.
I'm genuinely so happy for you!!!!
I AM SO HAPPY FOR YOU!!!
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Yoir reaction was very much like mine when i baught my car hehe, i cant wait!! Well done Micarah! Woop woop!

I'm genuinely happy for her and that she enjoys the chance to give that house the perfect home vibe. Also that place looks amazing.
I hate you date me already haha just kidding I don't actually know you, but I'm happy for you Micarah. That house suits you so well, can't wait until I move into my own crab shack and just go "toot toot" everywhere
Loved the fact that you prioritise financial security as opposed to fake luxury <3 haven't seen that one from YouTubers before
I love your excitement and vivacity...may you forever be happy in your new home xxx Thank you too for saving Garion from the pet shop!!❤️❤️
Honestly can't wait for the DIY projects that are going to be going on in that house
i haven't seen her this happy since she got Lasik
I am so happy for you, you have a house, may you use it with joy and happiness
Hey girl, just your friendly neighborhood security check - I was able to find your new address with the few details and photos you provided. Just letting you know since I know you’re worried about security. Maybe consider uploading the video again without key details - *number of bathrooms* *square footage* *year built* and photos. I know you’re proud and want to share, but just thought I would let you know.
This is so exciting!!
If I could go back in time I would cancel all seasons of MTV Cribs and replace them with Micarah prancing around her new house like a giddy fairy and I guarantee the world would be a better place for it.  The joy in the video is palpable.  Good for you!
nice joint, girlfriend.
I remember the time when Micarah only had 10,000 subscribers. She has done so many things to inspire and brighten our days. Micarah you deserve every bit of this! 💖
Congratulations! I’m so happy for you <3
your son is so behaved.
Yup there's the million dollar smile 😃  Congratulations girl 🎉🎉😀🎉
Congratulations! Well deserved!  I’ve watched you grow, and you have entertained us all with your humor and your talent. God Bless!
why didn't she put the lashes under water but only the eyeliner alone 👀
You deserve this so much. You bring such an amazing vibe on YouTube that always makes me smile. I love your content so much I’m so happy for you :DDD YOU DID THAT PERIOD
Congratulations 🎊 🎈👀💐
I AM SO EXCITED FOR YOU!!!!!
11:05 “Do you believe in reincarnation?” “No but they might” I’m dead
I am so happy for you., 💐
Watch Princess Diaries online Please don't give me a virus this time Julie Andrews is a queen Micarah Tewers is a house owning adult and the sudden desire I have to buy those lashes is mean (In all honesty I'm so happy for you! I'm excited to see what you do with the place!)
MICARAH i found your new address, i'm not a creep and wont post or share obviously but am worried someone else could.  1 * * 8 * U * * Ave just so you know i know. i can message you how i found it in case you want to stop others from doing the same.
So happy for you, you deserve it !
ahhhh so happy für you💫💛
I got my house a month after I turned 21 so many people were so shocked and many even thought it wasn't a good idea. (Spoiler it was a wonderful idea) Me getting a house actually made all my cousins want a house of their own and they're already older than I am. Idk why I'm rambling no one asked but I'm happy for you and your new home ☺️
Yay! So happy for you!
THat couch was $40?????? THats a steal!!!! I would have never guess that low!!!
“I know I don’t deserve this” PLEASE YOU DESERVE THE WORLD
love it :D!!!! Congrats!!!! It looks so nice :,))))))))
This made me teary-eyed 🥺 You’ve come so far girl! So proud of you!!!!
I've watched you for so long and seeing this video on my feed made me tear up. so proud of you
She uploaded on my birthday yaaaaaay😀😀😀😀🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗best bday ever
Good for youuuu
So you didn’t ,army one of the Jonas brothers? (My guess)
LEAVE CLOWNS OUT OF THIS THEY ARE JUST VERY FUNNY DUDES IN MAKEUP IN WIGS
i thought she said her promo code is “tumors” which i wouldn’t be surprised is it was
Woot woot I am 27, a fourth year teacher and am still at home because I live in a HCOL area. :D but :'( Edited to add: You ABSOLUTELY deserve this!!
CON GRAD U FRIGIN LATIONS!!!!! 🎷 👏 🔥 ❤
<3
That was the best titanic remake I've ever seen.
I’m glad you moved and are more careful about not showing your house. You posed in front of your dad’s house in a couple videos and I realized I was able to locate your house on google earth in under 10 minutes.
Of course you deserve it !!!! You worked for it !!!!!! CONGRATS !!!!!!! This home is so pretty!!!!!
I'm so jealous. I wish I had a house.
Fear of debt is 10000000% rational
Oh wow! As someone who is literally about to start house hunting within days and *also* never thought that would be possible, this feels like the hilarious sign I needed today! Congrats ladycakes!
So excited! Also does that mean you bought the house with cash?
I found someone who is as afraid of debit as I am
11:26 IM LAUGHING SO HARD 😭😭😭😭😭
congrats Micarah!!! I'm sooooooo happy for you!!! 💗💗💗
I totes understand the mortgage/debt fear as a scatter brained person myself I can't trust myself to manage debt #adhdthings.
Hell yeah you deserve it girl! I'm so excited for you and for the content that's about to hit us!
Yaay, I'm so proud of you! You're like the hilarious sister I have always wanted! (I do have a sister, but she is mean)
Im soooo happy for you!!
Old, lol, my house was built in 1751
WOOHOO!!!!
YAY!
You can invite me over I swear I’m not one of the weird ones....................maybe
WAHOOOO LETSA GO
When the dad blinked I cracked lmao
I really happy for you <3
4:31 is that reference to peacock in urdu or am I Iooking too much into it!?
Oh ok
Omg yay
Congrats!!!!! Im so happy for you Micarah!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️🎉🎉🎉🎉
Congrats, really happy for you!
Waterproof! Might give these a try, once I have some money leftover. My eyes are very particular towards anything water soluble
I'm so proud, congratulations!!!😭❤️
congrats!!!
Woah it has a staircase AND big windows you got a good one
SHE DESERVE EVERY SINGLE SUCCESS GUYS CAUSE SHE WORKED HARD FOR IT SO PROUD OF YOUUUUU WE LOVE YOUUUU💘💘💘
Aww this made me feel all fuzzy warm inside and I'm a cynical old dog. Congrat.
in need of scrambled eggs?
oh god you make me yearn for the day when i can buy my own house it seems so thrilling 🥺😍
Congratulations on your new home!!!! Especially announcing on women’s internal day, we couldn’t even own homes a while ago!
Congratulations!!! :)
Congratulations, my dear  Although it shouldn't be a rarity for someone your (our age) to buy a house). Our parents and grandparents HAD houses at 13 and 18, depending on the generation.  And yeah, me too, I REALLLLLLLY old houses, like from 1846. Or even older. Like if I could get a house from year 1, I'd like that.✅  although my favorite architecture I from the 1960's especially 1963-64
I usually skip the ad, especially the long ones. But THIS WAS SO GOOD
Work hard and this is exactly what we can achieve. Love to see this. I cried lol needed this motivation today!
A creative millennial with a house, that is a rarity, so congrats!!! You are such a hardworker!
Now you can get more chickens!!!!! And you have more space for all of your fabrics and sewing supplies and random things you collect !!! I'm very happy and excited for you  young lady. You earned it
Awe congrats!
luv ur vids soso muchhh
The inside of this house is absolutely beautiful!!! Congrats!!!!
Trailer queen to house queen
An affirmation is something positive, like a quote. People use them while shifting realities - for example, they say "I'm going to shift" which is positive because you believe in yourself to shift.
SO HAPPY FOR YOU, you really deserve this, congrats....i laugh so hard the that hand talking and the titanic scene
Yu definitely deserve that house micarah💜...yu make everyone of us enjoy and lough insanely..... I'm wishing you that yu and everyone may have wonderful memories with your house (mansion)🙈..god bless you dear 🦥
This really made me start crying 🥺 the only thing I want in life is to own a house
My goodness Micarah, seeing you this genuinely happy fills my heart. You deserve all of this, you've worked hard for it. Thanks for the endless laughs and smiles. Bless your soul.
Can I please be invited to regency tea? I will bring food and cake!!!
This is going to be the most creative house in the world good for you sis
You 're so fluffing cute when ur happy and congratulations on the house!
even im excited about your new house 😂 btw im not one of those creepy once👀😅
So happy for you!!! You deserve it!!!
GET SOME DOGS
You should do some videos where you make Disney princess dressed historically accurate.
* whispers:* but Micarah.... isn’t the thumbnail shoot in front of your house? can’t someone find you from that? I’m scared... just want you to be safe from creeps
MICARAH PLEASE WHERE ARE THOSE BROWN SHOES FROM OMGGGG SO CUTE LOVE YOU
You should make a dress out of that spare carpet.
The only time I won’t skip through a sponsor in a vid, lol
Congrats
Your sponsorship sections are the only ones on here that I don’t skip through, because they are so entertaining.  Also, congratulations on your house! It looks lovely.
Wow! Yay congrats!!
she looks so happy i didn’t realize i was smiling with her
Your “Making aValentine’s day dress” is 14 min and ONE second
I'm so happy for you omg! :)
Let's be honest everyone's happy for her.
Well, how did you train your son?? I mean he doesnt fly away im amazed
Congrats!!! You’ve earned your happy home!! Enjoy every moment of making those amazing memories in it!
Oh my word I LOVE it!❤❤❤
It sucks that people have to be so creepy! But congratulations!  You do deserve it! You worked hard for this! You get support from us because we enjoy your content and personality!
*I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO WORK OUT* for 2 years if this girl was certifiably insane or TOTALLY SOPRTDED...  Turns out she is TOTALLY SORTED.
your poor dad, he's so sweet to deal with "all of that!" LOL!!
Omg. My fiance has an addiction to Zillow too!
Congrats on your house Micarah it looks beautiful
12:13 i dunno bout u but is harry ok there-
Oh that titanic recreation was a cinematic masterpiece
I sometimes feel a little envious when young people my age can buy such "things" but not for Micarah. She deserves it all. The two RVs and this house! You deserve it all 😭😭😭
Dude!? THE THUMBNAIL???!!!
AHHHH! so cute, so happy for you!
yo- why tf does it have the same colors, and bones as my house-
awww im so happy for youuuu
os vídeos da micarah me dão saúde kkkkkk
Congratulations Micarah!
Seeing her literally frolick through her house made me so happy, especially when she threw her shoe. It's so satisfying looking at good people receive good things
That was the sweetest “I bought a house” video I’ve ever seen, so happy for you:)
I'm so excited for you!! It is absolutely gorgeous <3
YOU DESERVE THE WORLD SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU SO HAPPY
Its been my dream since i was a child to own my own house and do whatever decorating i want on it. Im so happy for you!!!
your dad is legit soooo precious
You should do a video inviting som subscribers to ur house for house party and teach us regency stuff. Make sure to do security screening tho. Also probably after COVID. I’d fly to Ohio for u
Also, the fact that after you read out that letter to your dad, the only thing he thought needed changing was that you believe in Reincarnation HAHAH
Let's pretend like we didn't know 😂
So wholesome
Ok but I want those magnetics eyelashes but I live in Latin America AND WE DONT HAVE THEMMM AGHHHGHHHHHHHHHHH
you look so happy it makes me happy
2 Rvs and a house for taking pretty pictures in!!
You bring so much joy to other people (including me) through your videos. You definitly deserve this! <3
Omg congratulations Micarah!!! You totally deserve this.🥺We can't wait to see your magical new chapter unfold in this new house!! Excited for all the new videos and good luck!  ❤️
yay, now i want a house, are you allowed houses when you’re 14?
Congratulations on your new 🏠 home🌼🌼the regency parties is such an aesthetic idea💜👀👀I wanna try them too when I get my own house...
😜😜CONGRATULATIONS 😜😜 And you do deserve this! ❤️
For all the laughter you bring us :') you're above and beyond deserving of that glam, gorgeous, spectacular h0usee
Congrats, that is amazing and it looks like  beautiful house! I prefer fewer big rooms over more small rooms too.
You remind me of Dot from MadTv so much in this video <3 Congrats Micarah! You deserve it all, every nook and cranny.
Oh my! Your house is so pretty!! I also am scared of house debt. I want so badly to buy one with only cash. We’re saving up and hope to do that some day. Congratulations!!
I think you deserve it and you can always add an extra bathroom late. And I am literally in love with that sofa(the sofa of my dreams) I wish they had good second hand places like that around where I live. Anyway congrats and May God continue blessing you.
gereon flying through that big ass house makes me happy
Omg congrats!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
YESSS FINALLYYYY
Yey! I'm so happy for you! The house is lovely❣️
Im so happy for you. You're wrong, everyone deserves to have a home they love, just not everyone gets to experience it. You so deserve it and I hope you have fun decorating :)))
Can’t wait to see your awesome room makeovers
My partner and I bought our home a little over a year ago. It was built in the early 1930s, having a home really is a privilege, but it’s even more so when it’s an old home, you almost have the responsibility of maintaining it for future generations. Congratulations!!
so happy for u !! 🤍
Why is no one talking about how ppl found her dads address and are leaving notes there...?
I, Asmi, swear that I have skipped a second of your advertisement. Micarah, congratulations, it's beautiful, i hope you the best and to the future house tour plus makeover videos. P. S. I find rollerskating on the floor to be the best idea, a goal after buying a house❤️❤️❤️
micarah has always struck me as someone who would roller skate in their house like Ms. Honey and I am glad to be proven correct
H o u s e 🧍‍♀️ i love it!!!!!!
I was smiling the entire time I was watching this video ahhhh I’m so happy for you Micarah!!! CONGRATS!!
I'm so happy for you!! You deserve this and more. Enjoy your house ❤️
Hi Micarah, congrats on the house. Safety tip though is to NOT post a picture of your house key. There are programs that thieves can use to duplicate the key and gain access to your house solely from a photo.
I just want someone to love me like Micarah lover her house
Congratulations 🎈🎉 ❤️
Jajajaj she is funny i love her xD
knew it
my enital reaction to seeing the notification was"YESSS MICARAH"
YAY CONGRATULATIONS 🥳 IM SO ECSTATIC FOR YOUUUU
YESSSSSS
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes I AM SO FRIKKING HAPPY FOR YOUUUU♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️. am i exagerating?🤣
Girl.... h..h...ho...how do you stay alone in that hella big house? I'm even scared of my own shadow.
The fact that I wasn't even surprised about her getting a house says a lot.
Congrats!

I'm SO incredibly happy for you! Omg even tho I don't know you on a personal level I feel so proud and ecstatic for you!! 💛💗 I can't wait to see what you do with the place and all the personal touches we know you'll add around the place! 😊
You are so deserving of this, I’m so happy for you I almost cried. This is so exciting!!!!!!! Hope that God blesses your house hold. Btw big fan ! ❤️❤️❤️❤️

HOUSE TOUR HOUSE TOUR
I am so proud of her! Congratulations girll
Btw congratulations girl🦋
You’re amazing Micarah!! You do deserve this!!! Enjoy!!!
I feel personally attacked that I, a realtor in Cincinnati and subscriber, was not asked to be your agent. I'm heartbroken. BUT CONGRATULATIONS!!!
what does it say when Micarah's "promo ad sponsor bit" is the only one I watch till the end?!
OH MY GOOOOOD! Happy International Women's Day to us. I'm so happy you have your house! Cannot wait to see everything  you´re going to do in it!
We need room makeover
How dare you not believe in sidewalks
Oof that “don’t move out til you’re completely comfortable and capable” thing hit hard because I’m 18 and moving out in a few weeks for university and I’m honestly so scared and don’t think I’m ready to live on my own but my parents say that I should, plus my university is far away so if I don’t move closer I’ll have to take a train for three hours to get to school everyday.  So basically living with my parents isn’t really an option for me but oh how I wish it was
i have nothing to say but i wanted to be included, hello
Congratulations!
Congratulations!!! I'm Soo excited for you
Eek so happy for ya!
happy to see u happy :')
i’m so happy for you !!!!
Congratulations 👏 👏
I read a title as i bought a mouse kind of makes sence and still watch the video thinking when will the mouse appear till it ended and reread the title ,makes more  sence the second time round but... Congrats!!!
why did i watch this video like a proud parent?
You put sooooo much work into your videos. You absolutely deserve it.  Thanks for keeping us entertained. ✋🏡
Best marketing choice Glamnetic has ever made.
You deserve it and I'm so happy for you!!
I hope I’m like this when I get a home of my own ☺️
Congratulations!!!
OMGG congratulations im so happy (about time) XD 😂😂
Ok, but can you share the photo of the dear in a wig 😆😆😆
Want an egg?
YEEEEESSSSSSSS!!! just bought a house this year and I resonate with so much of this video 😅 we waited forever because we were scared of debt, I am also homeschooled and without a college degree however I decided to pop out some babies... So that slows down the house buying. But when we walked into our home I instantly knew it was the one for me! And we've been here over 6 months and I still every once in awhile will call my husband while he's at work, tearing up saying: I'm home!!! I'm so happy because I'm home and I love it here😂
Woah my dads name is Mark William
I’ve never seen someone so happy to have a house :,)
Can I just say Micarah, you SUCH an inspiration. Thank you so much for always being so unapologetically you. You deserve every thing good in life and I can't wait to see where it takes you next!! 💞💞💞💞
OMG CONGRATS Also, thanks for validating living with your parents until you can afford to move out. I'm 23 and still live with my mom and brother and when I say people keep asking me why I haven't moved out... 🙄🙄🙄
CONGRATS! That's so exciting! Very happy for you :)
YRABBHHHHHHHHHH   Why is your thumbnail so cute😭😭😭
Soo wholesome
I’m so happy for you!!!!!
I just got the notification 😖 AN HOUR LATE
Congratulations 😁
I knew it! I commented on the last video asking if you bought a house!
Tbh especially the last minute made me so happy for her because you can almost feel her happiness through the screen Congrats
hi ily bye
Congratulations Micarah!  🎉🏰🎉
Micarah 100% deserves this! So happu for you!
Cool.
congrats!
It's so weird when I see that americans are so pressured to leave their home once they are like 18. Here in Mexico its pretty common to live with your parents until you get married sometimes lmao
Yay! I'm really happy for you. I can't wait for all the room makeover videos. I'm going to live vicariously thru your house. :)
I'm so happy for you!♥️🙏
I am so happy to realize that my favorite YouTuber also has a last name with all the letters right next to each other (From a Fellow “‘ewer”). Ps congratulations on being a homeowner, you deserve it all!!!
Congratulations 🎊👏
Congrats, this is so exciting! Also, Your ad reads are the only ones I actually enjoy watchings
I love your house so much and i will live vicariously through your happiness in buying it
I have had an awful day but ngl seeing this vid and your absolute joy and excitement has put a huge smile on my face

You're amazing, everything you say makes me smile and think. I believe you have stolen my heart. 🥰  Also you totally deserve this.
You DO deserve it gal! Congrats!!
✨ _I drink cake_ ✨  THE ONLY SUITABLE WAY TO INGEST CAKE.
if anyone deserves such a beautiful house as this one it’s you Micarah. IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU!!!!!!💕💕💕
welp, Didn't see that coming
WOOOOOOOOO LETS GOOOOOOOOO!
I'm gonna assume the dislikes are from the stalkers who are upset that they do not know where she lives anymore... get a hobby, preferably one that does not involve being a creep! 😒
I have had to watch 2 minuts of video to realise that you bought a HOUSE and not a HORSE... I'm disappointed because 1 : I can't read, and 2 : You would have looked so nice with your pretty horse... :( (but I'm also really exited to discover this house so back to the video! )
I am SO happy for you! 💜 you look so happy about it that you have me a boost of serotonin through the screen
Wait what I hope this doesnt end Van fun
YAY
OMG THAT'S AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU AND SO PROUD!
So happy for you!
Im soo happy for you micarah!
Congratulations! You deserve it! 💕
This makes me wanna have a house even more now!! Im working hard for it!
I KNEW IT
Micarah: "So as you can imagine" Ad: you can get whiskeys at Soriana for 50% off!!
I love how excited she is about this
i love youuuu! genuinely happy for you, can't wait for a tour honestly
Fear of debt is legit.
CONGRATULATIONS! IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU IT IS SO CUTE AHHHH
I just wanted to say I am so proud and so happy for you, you say you don’t deserve it but you really do, I hope you paint all the walls and rip it apart and make it your own. Seeing you have a house gives me a soon to be freshmen in college some hope
Oh umm.. actually you DO deserve this! ❤️❤️❤️
IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU!
I am SO HAPPY for you!!
Wow I'm so happy for you! You deserve this so much!
Congratulations Micarah! And for everyone who made this move necessary 😃 How about we all don’t stalk youtubers, celebrities (or anyone for that matter) and not force them to buy new houses and move out for their safety. 😀 sound doable? 😐
I’m the creepy one!
OMG no one deserves it more than you!!! Content queenn!!! Congratulations 🎊
The titanic joke sent me😭
you completely deserve it I am soo happy for you !!!!!
OH MY GAWSH I'M SO PROUD OF YOUUUUU AMAZING WONDERFUL I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOUUUU! YOU TOTALLY DESERVE IT
So proud of you! I loved to watch you and your channel grow, you truly deserve this beautiful house ❤️
One day I would love a house tour where you somehow got everything in.
I admit it....Im happy crying cause of your obvious joy in that last scene. Congratulations!!!!!!!
Can you PLEASE tell me how you got a house without a mortgage? If you did get a mortgage how did you save for the down payment? HELP I WANNA BUY A HOUSE NOW
You’re going to have to do a sewing room tour
Awww Yay I’m so happy for you Micarah I love the house too!!!
I'm so excited for you!!!! Enjoy it!
I love how half of the video is her making a commercial of glamnetic nails and lashes  Also congratulations on your house I I pray that only the best and good things will come, and no debt or mortgage. (Sorry if I cant spell😅)
🎊🎊🎊🎊🎊🎊🎊🎊
Congratulations!  🎉🎈🎊
Just to let you know I’m not a creepy girly     Or maybe I am who knows
Its comforting to see someone else who is terrified of debt 😅
NOW MORON CRIME lmao
Omg I am so excited for you and so happy that you found the house you really love may  you live long and happy in your new home ☺️
So happy for you!!!
so happy for you lovee🥺🥺🥺🥺
Whenever anybody says that a sidewalk somewhere dies!!!
I’ve been watching your videos for almost a year now and you are honestly my favorite YouTuber
“I recite my self-affirmations...”  “I don’t believe in sidewalks”
Quality of the videos just keep getting better! ❤
Congrats Micarah!!!
you're an actual disney princess oh my god
When she said that she didn’t deserve this, it broke my heart. Girl you absolutely DO deserve this. Just because you’re young doesn’t mean that you don’t deserve this amazing house!!!!
I’m so happy for you!♥️
Wow you didn’t have to call me out at 7:21
I’m so happy for you!!! I hope your house is only filled with joy, warmth, and great experiences which will make it transform into a velociraptor, a computer mouse, a penguin, then finally a “HOME”!
i'm so so happy for youuuuu
I’ve been in that house! (Don’t ask why) CONGRATS!!!
I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!
I love how the first thing Micarah  thought of doing was jumping ontop of the counters when she enters her house
Did everyone get an ad for zillow or was it just me?
I'm so excited for you ( /^ω^)/♪♪♪ \(^ω^\ )
I knew it! 🎊
so happy for you!! ahhh!!!! <3 <3 <3
I literally said out loud "I'm so proud of Micarah" as if she were my daughter and we're not probably the same age
I wonder what you would get if you got a past life reading. Maybe you really were an 1890s housewife
I am crying for you!!!!
PEEEERIODT QUEEEN
Here an hour in! Woo go Micarah!
Congratulations
Congratulation!! Enjoy your Happy house :)

I'm feeling more brave about my business because of you.  Here is a heart...cause i have no emojis on this device atm ;)

People still buy houses?
My dad liked to make me eggs too. That's how we found out about my egg allergy 😄
Congrats!
Why do I feel like I need to comment to give her money because she got a house?
12:39 thank you for having nothing against my country.
This is wonderful, I am so happy for you and I am so happy that there is someone like you, Micarah, who is a role model for your younger audience. But my only question is : ARE THE CHICKENS MOVING IN?????
So very happy for you!! Congratulations you homeowner you!!!!!

Awww congrats!! The house is gorgeous!! But need in depth Michareh decorated house tour pleasee!!
I got excitedly giddy omg congratss, what a dream. Lowkey realistic disney-independent life
I am both happy for you and shocked that your security was threatened. I got so nervous, when you did film an outside part of your house :/ Please stay safe!
you do deserve this!!! you’re such an amazing person and you make such amazing things- congratsssss 🥳🥳🥳
CONGRATULATIONS 🎊🎉🎈!!!!
I wish I had the money to buy a house WITH a mortgage, I'll never be able to just buy it all at once 😭
Omg congratulations!!!!!!!!!! You absolutely deserve this!!!!! Yes, you have privilege, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't have the house, it means that others should have the opportunity too. But enjoy it, you did it!!!!! It's yours!!!!!!!

I'm so happy for you Micarah! And you absolutely do deserve that house.
YAYYYY IM SO HAPPY!!

Normalize staying with your parents for as long as they’ll let you
Congrats! I’m so happy for you! 😊 You put in so much time and effort for your videos, nice to see it paying off.
OMG I am so happy for you! This video was hilarious as usual. I wish you have wonderful memories in this new house
This video was the cutest thing I've ever watched and also gave me the most satisfaction in seeing a youtuber I watch get the house of their dreams.  If anyone deserved this house, or any house, it's you.
I'm so sorry folks were being creepy, that's not cool! I'm so happy for you and your new home!
Congratulations on your new house!!🥳
OMG ITS BEAUTIFUL 😍😍
This is so endearing
1:03 is such a mood because I just watched princess diares 1 & 2 over the weekend in an illegal sight
😲 didn't see that coming!
Micarah out here living her best life
This was actually really sweet hahahaha
don't mind me, just smiling at Micarah's happiness :D

CONGRATS GIRL! I’m so happy for you!! You totally deserve such a wonderful and vintage looking house!!
I was smiling while watching every second of this video, I'm sooo happy for you, you deserve it <3

Stay with your parents if possible.  They get very lonely and helpless when they get old.
your happiness is so contagious!!! congratulations we love you so much!!!!💗

She a big girl no more RV 😔😭. Congrats love you deserve it ❤️
I wonder how many times she retyped "Tewers" to get that shot
This makes me so happy ☺️
I'm so happy for you 🤩🤩😍
you deserve it so much for giving us great content 💜💜💜💜
You think having a fear of clowns is bad? Well think again!   You don’t see clowns walking down the street 24/7 *well halloween in 2016 is a different story*  but you know what you do see?   Butterflies!   Do you know what I’m scared of?   Butterflies!   It sucks man…
That fear of debt is relatable!! I'm living my fears... But nontheless CONGRATULATIONS!! XD you totally deserve it.
first it's yoongi day and now my favourite youtuber got a house?? i'm smiling non stop :D
Weird ... never been in a 2 bathrooms at the same time  , that’s sus

Congratulations on the new house!! You DEFINATELY deserve this 😁 We might not be able to have a party at your house, but we'll be celebrating in the comments for sure!
40$ for a WHOLE COUCH is a steal in my books
Why did I like the ad so much.....
Just FYI please don’t mention your stalker in vids again, they love any attention they’re given as they think it’s messages just for them and it’s code between the two of you! The POS isn’t worth it!
i’ve never seen someone so happy, congrats u deserve thid
I’m here my queen ! Edit: I LOVE THE HOUSE you are so lucky to have a sewing room I only have an area in a guest room.
YAYYY
Who else is just so HAPPY for her I literally was smiling so hard watching this.
Micarah you ar so talented and you diserve it
Micarah: I am afraid of debt  Me:laugh in rich and never have to work to get money and will never be poor then start crying because I feel bad for the people that are in poverty and i can't help  Legit I cryed once because of some of the kids were so happy even tho there in poverty then when they get so happy about  any little thing you give so cute 😊 them
Dude that looks like such a nice house! We are all excited to see how you make it your own. A homeowner at your age (25 or 26) is a big deal where I live in the Northeast, so a lot of us are mad jealous haha. Congrats!!!!!
I‘m so happy for you!! You totally deserve this  ❤️❤️❤️
The neighbours will be  confused.
YaY!! ConGraTUlatiOnS!
Congrats on the new home.  It is beautiful.  I can't wait to see a full tour and to see what you do with it.

CONGRATULATIONS ☺💖💕!!
awhh I'm so happy for you!!! The house looks so amazing!
Woohoo!!!!! So exciting! Have fun decorating and making it your own
this young lady is a tornado of energy and talent. texas could use your energy to power their entire grid. her smile and awsome sense of frenetic humor is contagious in the best way possible ! welcome to home ownership. and keep up your goofy outlook on life
Do a house tour once you finish decorating and fixing it up! 🌸💜🧡
I really wanted to say this and this time I actually have a chance of Micarah seeing it, so I just wanted to say that Micarah's older sister Shaylyn has the exact name and spelling of my first name. (I think I spelled her name right, this is how I saw it was spelled in her "watching my birth" video so ya)
I'm so happy for you!! your content brings me so much joy, I'm happy that you are thriving, sorry about the creeps tho
Please for the love of god don’t try and figure out her address
The fact she brought Gareon to the signing the lease that is so precious 😂❤️
Micarah congratulations!!! And you're so humble but you deserve everything you got and more! :) You always make my day (and I'm sure many others) when you post!! You spread joy to so many people, a house is like the least you deserve. <3
queen i'm literally so happy for you
knowing micrah, someone couldve told me this was a prank and I wouldve believed every part of it
You do deserve this
OMG it's BEAUTIFUL!

CONGRATSSS 🎉🎉
So happy for you! It’s BEAUTIFUL!❤️
“I know I don’t deserve this” Yes you do dont say that 😡😡
I think it's amazing how grateful she is that we all just sit her and watch her for 14 min and that it's been able to get where she is! It's all her and her hard work that got her there and I hope she feels very proud!
Congratulations Micarah!!!! <3
Now you can get chickens!

Oh my goodness, I'm so happy for you! It warms my heart to see you so full of joy 🥺You absolutely deserve everything you have, especially after all this time you devoted to us sharing your life and making us laugh 😍😭❤️❤️❤️
Wait, so you paid for the house in cash? Also, my close date on my first house was 2/19 😊 I have a mortgage, tho 😒
I literally want to live there 🥺
uurgghh I just love how happy micarah is right now... congratulations on your house girlll x
Okay but, seeing Micarah happy about her new house just makes me happy 😊😊😊
CONGRATS!! 😆
Please, if you ever host regency and Victorian tea parties, invite me! I'll gladly pay an exorbitant amount of money to hop on a plane and go to the US... I mean, exorbitant specially for me that Brazilian Real is worth almost nothing and a ticket to go to the US is ridiculous expensive (to my standards) .  Idk, help me, I just want tea parties and all my friends are no fun to come dressed up to these things!
Oh i love your house!!
My eyes initially read 'I BOUGHT A HORSE' and now I want to see that video too lmaoo
Wait what? Youtube is moving mad for not giving me a notification
she is the only YouTuber ware i like to watch a paid promotion
As a fellow taurus this is totally inspiring. CONGRATS MICARAH!!!
This is the greatest house I've ever seen! Those poles! The details! Everything!
Why is she so goddamn cute - like who gave her permission to melt my heart like that?!
did you thrift your brown shoes? omgggg i love them
I'm so happy for you! Congratulations on the new house, you look so happy and excited!
I’m so happy for you!
I feel good and bad for her neighbors  Good because- cmon she’s amazing And bad  because-
I feel so much joy for you! Congratulations :)
I hope I'm not a creepy one, even though I DM'ed you about feet pics once (like not wanting feet pics, but being concerned with you being asked about your feet). Have a nice day in YOUR FREAKING HOUSE YOU EARNED IT !!!!!!!!!!!!! GO GIRL! UPLOADED ON INTERNATIONAL WOMENS DAY
Last Saturday i forgot your name so i told my best friend about my favorite youtuber Mikayla Tewers.
The look on your dad's face 😂😂😂

I remember the first Micarah video I watched, it was the one about chicken food bags. I love her jokes. Her videos inspired me to try and make a dress for the first time ever. The bodice is done, the skirt is almost done, and I’m loving it! I’m so glad she’s got a house of her own!!! I'm happy she's happy.
Congratulations you deserve it  ♡´･ᴗ･`♡
You DO deserve this house. You are hardworking and dedicated to your goals. You go girl!!

Everyone deserves a home, happy for you
Got ads for mortgages throughout this video. :)

A Micarah video????? Best birthday present ever
I saw the notif at the library and decided to stop studying and leave in order to watch this lol
Who else wants Micarah doing a video made  of just commercials
You should make a k-12 dress crybabies version
MICARAH I AM SO EXCITED FOR YOU!!! The place is so cute (I'm obsessed with built in shelving) and suits all your needs!!
Her happiness makes me happy:)
Me: Bored scrolling threw YouTube Also Me: Oh Micarah bought a house....WAIT WHAT
So happy for you!!!!!!
Figured it out a while ago but glad that you finally announced it!!
Aw ☹️ I read the title wrong and thought you bought a horse 🐎😓
I have such house envy
I literally didn’t even question the final scene in the last video, and that’s saying something 🤣
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah im so happy for you im crying. for real God bless you
I’m excited for a house tour, (only inside)
Congrats, so happy for you!
MICARAH GIVE ME YOUR HOUSE  Just kidding I’m not that creepy guy slipping notes under your door 😅
micarah flexing on us kinda making me want to get a house too
Her home is beautiful, and it suits her well. I'm so happy for her🥰
You so deserve this!!! Definitely need to make 1 room your Barbie room!
Micarah did it again she made this video exactly 14 minutes long
Congratulations!!!!
You're more deserving of a house than most ""influencers"". Seeing you happy makes US happy!
I'm so happy for her!
Omg please show us when your renovating the house. Kinda like the RV video. I really wanna see what you do with the house.
“i don’t believe in sidewalks” LMFAO
Love this so happy for you Micarah! You bring me so much joy with your content!
4:53 SPIRIT ORB you caught a spirit on camera
I am SO happy for you 💗💗💗
“I don’t believe in sidewalks” you are too cute.
Yay! MoRe SpAcE mOrE dReSsEs
I’m just glad you have a house that can store that ariana dress now
ok its time to act shocked and surprise that she got a house; Oh my sweet Jesus. I did not see this coming at all (read it in a very sarcastic way). Joking aside, congratulation!
I'm so happy for you, and your house is GORGEOUS.
I got a Zillow add before this video, and now I’m second guessing where I live with this video and all...
Congratulations party hard but safely. ... sending lots of love and warm wishes
You are the best.
She bought a house by sewing and speaking, Lol love your videos
youre absolutly adorable
Micarah, I will GIVE YOU my Disney+, please stop illegally watching Princess Diaries
I'm sooo very happy for you micarah!!!!!!!❤️😊
Im happy for her but also sad that we don’t get any rv vidios
oh no she did not bring her bird with her to the bank!
omg i feel so happy for you like you just made my day with your joy and i hope you'll really keep on feeling good in your GORGEOUS (i'm litteraly in love) house and be the happy virus you are damn ily
I really happy for you! I live with my dad still and I'm saving up to buy a little piece of land I can build on!
Also can I just say I love the fact you bought a house but still get your furniture/clothes from thrift stores. We love a responsible queen! That’s what I’m gonna do when I get my own place one day. And with your sewing skills you can just make all new cushions and curtains and stuff!
"which leads us to our next sponsor..." LMAO
House tour
I'll always be jealous of how cheap american houses can be, but I'm so happy you are able to own one without dept! Honestly ur so smart and you worked so hard for it so don't feel bad or that you don't deserve it. You made content that people enjoy and that's enough haha!
Congratulations!!!
Congrats on home ownership! I love my house too. Though there is much I want to change about it.
Can't tell if that's an embroidered horse or a schmutz on your sweater... Love it
YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY THE CUTEST
Congratulations on the house! Sorry to hear about the creepers.
I'm so sorry you had/have to deal with creeps. Sending good vibes. Congrats on the house!
I skipped bio notes for this video, and I am glad to admit that I have still learned a lot
Happy happy happy for you!!!!!
Congratulations!!!!!!
Congratulations, we’ve been supporting you since  before the first RV
We’re so happy for you!
Yessssss! Congratulations!
The genuine excitement that radiates from this video makes me excited! Does anyone want to give me their house?
YAY, CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IT LOOKS SO PERFECT AND BEAUTIFUL AND YOU TOTALLY DO DESERVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Just because it’s a privilege doesn’t mean you don’t deserve it. You work hard and the universe decided to bless you for it
I hope it's not haunted!! ... or maybe I do... muahahaha!
When she put a make up on her hands with lashes be lyk:        🍃    🍃       👁️👄👁️

Congratulations on the new house
Seeing people genuinely happy is so cute and makes me happy 🥺💖 I’m glad you got a house it looks amazing!!!

She’s the only person I actually like watching through the “paid promotion” rant 😂
E
That video is incredibly wholesome ! 🥰 So happy for you ! I hope we'll still see your adorable father now and then... He must be so proud and happy for his little girl ! 🤩
FALSE! Titanic was constructed in 1910😤😤😤
Congratulations on your house!!!
YOU YOU DESERVE IT
This video just made me so incredibly happy! Congratulations on the house!
it was just me that felt and smiled for her happiness and excitement? :P
You’re living the dream man. It’s my goal/dream to buy a home in cash; a mortgage is my sleep paralysis demon.   I’m really happy for you, and I hope you’ll always have the ability to live your dreams out in reality. 💕
Congratulations, hope you always love it.
congratulations!!!
I AM SO SO HAPPY FOR YOU, MICARAH 😘 YOU DESERVE THE WORLD
CONGRATTSSSS 🥳🥳🥳
OMG YOU DON'T KNOW HOW HAPPY I AM FOR YOU MICARAHHHH OMG CONGRATULATIONS AND YOU *TOTALLY 100% DESREVE IT!!!!*
anyone know where those brown shoes are from? they’re gorgeous
Are you saying if Marie Antoinette used Glamnetic her head wouldn’t have fallen off?
on a serious note, it really sucks that people have been harassing her etc. micarah seems like such a nice and fun person and she doesn’t deserve to be scared of people like that :(  for the people who are confused, she talks about it at 5:42
Congrats!!!
i cannot believe you call them dippin eggs!!
Glamnetic when micarah technically fulfills their sponsored video requests via interpretive titanic hand dance: 👁👄👁
I just hope you and you and your son can safely share the bathroom ❤️❤️
She makes me want to buy a house lol
I didn't know I needed and hand-face reenactment of Titanic 😂😂😂
I've had a rough few weeks and it made me so happy to see you happy. It's a gorgeous house, and you absolutely deserve it!
u deserve this !!! congrats🥰
So happy for you Micarah! X Videos of absolute madness and genius-ness to be followed!
Congratulations!
Congrats!
I saw the title in my notifications and got so damn excited, can't believe I'm only living through her
Aaw I’m so excited for you. My fiancé just bought a house too, and I never thought that would happen to me in my twenties. Wood floors are a MUST. 🥰🥰
Yayyy! Congrats boo!
Your videos never fail to make me smile! I know it feels like you don't deserve this, but every day you are making someone's life a little brighter one video at a time. You were the reason I started sewing!  Thank you for making such wholesome and hysterical content !
Your house is perfect! It’s so quirky like you. Of course you deserve it.
CONGRATULATIONS!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼so happy for you
It stared with one rv, now we buy together everything and i love it XD
Did she watch the Titanic right before making this video?
Your joy is so genuine and contagious. Congratulations~^^

Aww congrats Micarah!! You deserve it, I’m so happy for you!!

I am so happy for you!! I bought my first house last year and it's the best thing I have done in life so far! Girl power!!!! Happy International Women's Day!! You are so funny and make my day during these tough times. Hello from Houston, TX!!❤
How is her dad last name Williams and her last name is Tewers?!??
I still want a pistachio amor video with your new houses you have enough space to collect an entire room full of shells for it!
This made me cry and I am also super afraid of debt so I will never have my own house probably but damn it's nice to dream :)
she gave us hints in the last video "i'm running out of space" "i bought another RV for more space and I'm still running out of space" "if you're wondering where I got this vacant house to film in"
waittt, this is actually so wholesome 8-8
guys i think she has a house
You so do deserve this! You are pure and talented and maybe a bit odd, but so so deserving
I FUCKIN KNEW IT
Congrats girl!
okay but is it okay to be so PROUD of you?? omg lots of love from France queen

Well, that was cute.

Oh look, I'm not the only person with an irrational fear of dept
wholesome
"i dont believe in sidewalks" is it weird that i understand and relate to that?
GOD i love her bird
YAY!! Congratulations!! (Also I played Old Time Rock and Roll while watching the montage as requested)
I'm so happy for you I hope you have the best time living there and make to many memories ( and great content that makes me laugh while trying to eat food)
I love seeing people happy :)
FINALLY
whats the weight of the house
Im so sad you were having horrible men follow you - I hope you get all the safety and security you deserve with this new move!
Okay but hear me out: make curtains out of shirts you don’t wear but can’t get rid of
I'm happy for you, dude!
Best advertisement ever
You totally desserve it Micarah!! Im so happy for you! I guess I was that 1% who didnt get it in the previous video 😂
I am so so happy for you! These are exciting times!! Your hard work is paying off!! 💜💜💜
When u spend like five minutes  of a 14 minute vid talking about deer and wigs, and then don't put a wig on your dear head thing.
Omg I’m so happy for you. Girl I’ll be 26 this year and I’m still with my parents. Can’t move out unfortunately. I can’t wait to see your restorations to your home! Whoooooo!
this house has so much character! i already know your renovations are gonna be mind-bogglingly weird yet perfect so i can't wait!!
I just had a idea for your next DIY costume. I'd love to see you do a WandaVision costume. Or Agatha. Either would be so much fun to see you pull off. Thank you 🧙‍♀️ 🧹 💜
You so super deserve this Micarah! Thank you for being such a joy and unapologetically yourself!!💖💗🤗
Sooo happy for youuuuu
wow! i really like this house too and i think you deserve it. Ever since i started to watch your channel i fell in love with the victorian era and may i just say that this house isnt really like a victorian house but thats besides the point that my dream house is like a modern victorian house. so its victorian but it has modern stuff in it. ( i am not old enough to buy i house but i have dreams.)
Are you bringing chickens?
I feel the same way about debt 😐
Ahh CONGRATULATIONS!!! X
You are the only YouTuber who can keep my attention during an ad
So excited for you! It's been awesome to see you grow on your journey over the last year-ish! So wish I could meet you in person!
I feel like people are overlooking the fact that she admitted she's had security problems... LEAVE YOUTUBERS AND OTHER INFLUENCERS TF ALONE. ☺️🥰💕✨  Thank you for reading. (passive-aggressive smile)
She such a fun and optimistic person
seeing Micarah this happy is actually heart warming-
You're the only channel where I sit through the sponsors. And good thing I did, or I would've missed that heart-wrenching reenactment of the titanic.
“I don’t believe in sidewalks”  So inspiration
I am SO HAPPY for you, Micarah ! 🌺🌻🌺🌻🌺🌻🌺🌻🌺 🎊 Congratulations 🎉 And every Blessing to you and your family 💐
Not me crying cause i’m so happy for you! And you totally deserve a house! You bring us so much joy, i’m glad me subscribing played a tiny part in your happiness because it certainly plays a part in mine 💖
hey, CONGRATUFREAKINLATIONS!!!!! you definitely do deserve this, please don't let anyone tell you otherwise! you've worked hard, creating and doing what you love and you're inspiring tons of people while doing so!! so so happy for you, i wish you all the best with your new home endeavor and i can't wait to keep seeing you thrive!!!<3 <3 <3
Her neighbors are lucky to have someone this entertaining living right next to them.
i did not notice she filmed in a new house because i am unobservant
Congrats Micarah!!
No way that’s beautiful! The eggs part was hilarious x
Get in loser, we’re going to bleep street 🥰 anyways congrats!!
Congratulations Micarah!!  Please pray that I will also land a job after years of study and owning my own house soon... 😆😆😆
Christmas Tree will be missed :(
Why. I love u but why
You ABSOLUTELY deserve this!!! We’re so happy for you and can’t wait to see how this next journey in life will go 🥺❤️❤️❤️
Yay Micarah!
So my guess on the last video was right, you did bought a house :D
You crazy gal! Love you! <3
“I wish I could invite you all to my house, but I don’t know which ones of you are the creepy ones” 😂😂😂😂
So happy for you!!
Me and her both live in Ohio so we should hang out no I’m joking buttt.....
She’s one and a half person and here I am feeling dead inside 😭
I love that Micarah always does things completely different from other people on youtube! Not once in this video was I feeling anything other than happiness for someone as amazing and dorky as her!
Alright which one of yall are the creepy dudes that harassed micarah at her old home bc I will find you and fight you (from a distance bc, you know, pandemic thingz)
I can't wait to see what she does with it. ♡
Gongrats
not me actually crying because micarah loves her new house
It's not even my house but her happiness is contagious I'm genuinely happy for her  🥺🥺💞💞💞💞
This somehow filled me with as much giddy exitement as you were feeling or maybe even a little more! Congrats on achieving this!
So happy for you! Congratz 🎉
You deserve it! So happy for you!
Oh my gosh, I'm so happy for you! ^-^ And I really hope none of those creepos find it this time! Please be safe! I've heard of one YouTuber where a creepo actually found their address based on the the type of window frames they saw in one video (aparently they were really rare). I just hope this doesn't happen to you and you can enjoy this beautiful dreamhouse of yours for the rest of your long happy every after disney princess life ^-^
I am so happy!!! I've been waiting for this day for years now. Congrats!
You are literally the funniest person I know
just asking why would you buy a house when you have two RVs?
You are literally what the world needs
Love the video! But it makes me sad that people don’t respect your privacy. Hopes it gets better now.
Ok kay now I want magnetic lashes. HUBBBY YOU GOTTA BUY ME MAGNETIC LASHES
Sigh I be living with my father and brothers (I love them don't get me wrong). But I wish I could buy my own place. I'm 21 and I'm currently in college for computer animation! something I've been wanting to do ever since I was a kiddo! I'm so happy I got this far and I cant wait to see how the future goes for myself.
That Twin Peaks outfit is everything 😏✨ Congratulations!!! Enjoy it 💖💖💖
Those $1.37 packs of gum DO add up 😔
as soon as she mentioned clowns i SCREAMED I FEEL ATTACKED
At this point i just feel like i'm part of the family too, and that makes me happy ♡
im so happy for u AAAAAAAAAAAA
Even if Micarah's videos were just commercials, I'd still watch every second hahaha ...now I have a strong urge to buy eyelashes... completely unrelated to watching this.
You DO deserve this!!!
I hope glamnetic is paying her well because this is the only sponsored portion of a video that I refuse to skip
Don’t worry about waking up at noon, you avoid the regrets in the morning this way.
Your reaction is adorable! You most definitely deserve this!
i’m so happy for you!! congratulations! you deserve it!
$40 😡 , I literally paid $1,800 for that same couch. Congrats Doll 👏
Oh but you absolutely deserve that house! Everyone deserves a house tbh, but especially you because your videos make all of our lives a little bit better
Congratulations on your house!
Nooooo, I just convinced my ex to keep his tiny trailer because of you. Lol
Congratulations! 🎊🎉🎂
In school cant watch rn I know its gonna be great!!!
The para-social tendencies were strong with this one. Enjoy your well-deserved house Micarah.
omg
As  your fan you make us so proud Micarah!! 💖✨🇵🇭
im so happy for you!!
I don’t live too far from you, I wish we were friends! You seem like a good friend to have😂💕
I'm happy for you! :)
i literally check the speed of my video bc i thought i was on 1.25 so i put the speed at 0.75 and it felt normal 😂😂
Your house is so beautiful l'm so happy for you
the fact that there are so many creepers a-creeping in the wild bums me out... BUT OMG, YOU HAVE A HOUSE AND IT LOOKS SO COOL ALREADY AND I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU! :D
Omg I'm soo happy, it's as if I bought a house🥺🥺❤️❤️
I’m genuinely so happy for her ahhhh <3 congrats Micarah, I only hope one day I’ll also buy a house of my dreams 😭
the video title should be: micarah being awesome and making her house awesome and telling us how awesome it is in 14 minutes
Im impressed with the exact 14minute-length of this video
You do deserve it though. You work and you live in a state with very rough winters. You deserve it.
Micarah’s sponsors are the only ones I don’t skip through
This made me happy seeing you happy :))))
I thought you simply Broke into one of your friends house again
That’s called ✨👏character development 👏✨ right there
omg micarah you absolutely deserve that house!!! congrats!!!
🎶  Open up the champagne, pop! It's my house, come on, turn it up  Hear a knock on the door and the night begins Cause we done this before so you come on in Make yourself at my home, tell me where you been Pour yourself something cold, baby, cheers to this...” 🎶   It’s all I could hear while you were walking around.
Omg I literally screamed!!! I’m so happy and excited for her
Too cute 🥰
Glad u bot a house.  Dont blame u and I know how much you love your parents.
I'm so happy that people can afford things because other people watch for free the content they put on the internet. 😊😊😊
Micarah is the best. ..
I was binge watching last night and now I wake up to this.....never been more excited 😂
Nobody deserves it more than you
We're very happy for you, Micarah massive congratulations!!!
Your house is absolutely gorgeous
You look so happyyyy!! It's contagious, I swear 😂 I'm so happy for you and I'm so proud of you, can't wait to see more videos in YOUR NEW HOUSE!! 💕
I only ever skip the ads that are full on movies, and podcasts so ye
IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU OMGGGGGG
MICARAAAAHHH!! This is so exciting, congratulations!
THERE WAS ROOM FOR LASH JACK ON THAT SCRUBBER
14 minutes 02 seconds would’ve mean 14/02 (14 february) i’m so triggered
OMG YOU BOUGHT A HOUSE!!!!!!!!
Watching this video felt like watching a friend realize her dreams, and redefine success for herself!! Getting a old house is also a dream of mine that feels so far into the future I can't even see it, and you have the same dream, and IT CAME TRUE!! (sorry, that feels like yelling). The most amazing thing is that I don't feel the need to feel jealous, I just feel happy that you have realized your dream and I will live vicariously though you till I can get my own old house. Totally worth losing being 20 minutes late to class!
Aaaaaa
I've always been intimidated about the idea of being a homeowner but after living in a similar situation as you were pre-homeowner, it honestly makes me think about it in a less scary light
I tried to like your video three times and each time I remembered that I had already liked it before even watching it
Congartulations....So happy for you 🥺🥺🥺🥺💖💖❤❤😍😍
Congratulations!
ok i literally misred the title and thought you bought a horse lmao... I'm so happy for you!!!! you so deserve it
Joke's on you, I'm not scared of clowns. However, I am scared of tape measures
Omgggg....I am so happy for you...you deserve this...we love you and will always support you 💜💜💜💜💜
I LEAVE FOR A BIT AND THIS IS WHAT YOU DO?!?! Anyways, congrats on your new home :) EDIT: I just finished watching this video and it's so cute-  CONGRATS MICARAH WE LOVE YOU
I am so happy for you, and you do absolutely deserve that house and the life you're living, you found a way to monetize your amazing creativity in this bleak capitalist world and you should be proud of yourself. I tell you this as someone who's creativity is also stifled by low pay job and is constantly fighting to find a more fulfilling way to earn my dime: you DO deserve this. Enjoy it fully. Love ya :')
i love her so much she makes my day so much better
This is my favourite video of yours because you just so gosh darn happy in it and it makes my happy by proxy. Congratulations and I wish you and your new house all the love and joy in the world :))))
Genuinely happy for you! Definitely well deserved✨
I hope she is getting enough for that sponsorship
Oh, I def saw a ghost @ 4:54
Your so happy it’s gonna make me cry 😭😭
Congrats Micarah!! I'm so proud of you!!  <3
I swear if I ever need to sell a product ima sponsor Micarah
OMG THAT HOUSE IS EVERYTHING
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ congratulations micarahhh!! You Did it!!
I was litterly just bingeing you're videos and I was like dam id like to see her decorate a house
Congrats!!! This house looks awesome!!! I’m like sixteen so I can’t exactly get my own house so I’m just gonna live vicariously through you don’t mind me
I am so sorry you had to move due to creepy stalkers. I hope you feel much safer in your new home!
Idk why but the sound effect at ur dads blink made me laugh so hard 😂😭😭
13:42 legit looks like a cover shot and she ain't even trying! Effortlessly beautiful <3
You didn’t fool me. Good for you
So exciting!! You are going to be the world’s coolest neighbour!
congrats! 🙃
That's what you deserve!!! I'm so happy for you, enjoy it girl! (btw I feel same about loans and mortgages)
How can I be so proud of someone I don’t even know?   well :)
Good job. I'm so happy for you.
That's so exciting!! Congratulations on your new home. It looks so pretty! ♥️
“I don’t know which are the creepy ones”    ... that’s it ladies and gentlefolk! That’s the comment. Goodbye, the end.
Can we hold the excitement that she got a house and just talk about how she is Cinderella...
Girl! :-) did you buy this without a mortgage? Amazing job! So excited and proud for you  :-)
Omg ur house is my dream house it’s slightly vintage and just gorgeous overall
I’m so happy for you Micarah! Can’t wait to see the eventual house re-decorating video you do
Congratulations Micarah! You deserve it!
Girl you literally taught me how to sew (well you and Bernadette Banner), you deserve this so much!! I'm happy for you!
Ahh you absaloutly deserve this house. Seeing how happy and hyper you are is making me happy and hyper too ❤️
Your dad is adorable ❤️
Aw Micarah, I'm so happy for you! The house is so lovely and pretty and- I don't know what else to say other than it's just perfect.  P.S.: Thank you for making the video exactly 14 minutes long. 😂
its so great to see you this happy!
A home?!! When can we move in?
You're gorgeous and so is your home! Congrats!!!
Congratulations!!
Ugh sorry people were being creepy, hon. That's gross
6:30 ma'am, you do not know my parents. 😅
You are the most captivating person on the Internet, I almost went and both the lashes, that I don't even use, but I remembered that my country can pay me double on the border for it :D
OMG MISS GURL MICARAH WE ARE SO PROUD OF YOU . if you ever feel unmotivated to create a dress, just remember you have millions of people who love an support you. Your humor gives me life and your personality is so cheerful. No matter what people may say, remember that we love you. Sorry for the long message.
I don't believe in sidewalks
The whole videos just for screaming I buy a house
I am so happy for you and your house. I'm glad it got such an amazing and loving owner!
wait wah we eciugy
It's perfect and you definitely do deserve it, congratulations Micarah. Old Houses are the best. I live in a Victorian house, I wouldn't wanna live anywhere else. Happy for you 🦋
technically the construction on Titanic started in 1909 and ended in 1911 so still existed before 1910.... hehe  Titanic enthusiast/nerd/obsessive (also I have a phobia of clowns)
the video actually starts at 5:14
Oooo now you can pay for it by letting us watch you renovate it! Smart cookie you are
Congratulations!!
Congratulations!! I just bought my first house too at the ripe old age of 22 and I know what you mean, it's so humbling. Literally I close on it two days from now so when this popped up on my feed I was like !!! The only tiny difference is I will have lots of debt lmao
Aww she looks so happy!!! That made my entire day♥️
Okay now show us how you trained this adorable bird ♡ super happy for you :) you deserve it
Why did I read the tittle as... I Bought A Horse
This video made me so happy that I just started crying. You deserve that happiness!
Can confirm, my dads house was made in 1910 and the ghosts in it are way more cool than the ghosts in my moms house
What’s a girl gotta do to get a heart from you 👁👄👁
Spastic is a slur for those who suffer with cerebral palsy if you didn’t know x
that was so wholesome oh my god
i wanna have an 18th century tea party i could wear my evening gown and my favorite bonnet
Congrats love
Micarah, I am so happy for you! I can't wait for the videos to come in the beauty of a house and I am glad you feel safer here and are so excited. I love seeing you so giddy. Congratulations!
Congratulations! Also in Ohio if you need help renovating
I'm so happy for you!! As a musician in her early 20s, I fully understand the feeling of maybe needing to not pursue my passion so that I can make money to survive. I'm so glad it worked out for you, and I hope one day it might for me as well.
WE WANT A HOUSE TOUR...❤😍
ok i cried    why did I cry
I am happy for you micarah🥺❣👏👏
My girl bought a house, happy for you 😭😭😭
Garion just casually leaning in while Micarah read the personalized letter is the most adorable thing in those whole video
I appreciate your thoughts on living at home with your parents/family until you can actually afford to move out. Why is it more acceptable to live with a bunch of roommates but not your family? I don’t get it. But we live in different times. Student loan debt is crippling and things are much more expensive than they were 50-60 years ago.
I know noone asked...   but im IN LOVE with your house <3
Bought my house at 19. What a great investment for your future and to live debt free. 👏
You're wrong, you TOTALLY deserve this house!!!! I am so happy as if one of sibllings had gotten a house. Congratulations!!!   P.s: Are your chickens with you???
Very excited to be your neighbor
Congratulations on the new house!
I am so happy for her she sounds so happy????
Congrats queen!!
That is such a nice house wow
I got chills when I heard your letter to the past home owners.
AHAHAHA YOU BOUGHT A HOUSE
So happy for you!!! CONGRATULATIONS!!! Loved your content from day one and so excited for your future!! Sending all the positive energy :)
Congratulations!!! You deserve it
I feel  so proud of Micarah, she deserved it so much
This video was exactly 14 minutes
I drink cake
So cute I love this for you. Congratulations woohoo
YESS MORE SPACE FOR YOUR SEWING SUPPLIES
I’m sooo happy for you!! You really deserve your own house and also wow I have been seeing this thing on tik tok about how people can manifest things in their life I kinda feel you you did something like this lmao
I need more than a thumbs up for this video -- I need a heart!  SOOOO happy for you!
I’m so excited for all the decorating and making the house her own type of videos! I love these hehe so happy for you!!
YESSS CONGRATS MICARAH!
Yay I’m so happy for you it looks beautiful
Micarah: pulls out left over carpet Me: she’ll probably make a dress out of it Btw so happy for you😊😊😊😊 have a blessed day!
I'm sort of early
Wow, I've never seen anyone so happy about getting a house but I feel you. I wish i had my own house. Well, congrats Micarah. Love from Malaysia 💜
Question do you ever plan on having someone move with you or get another animal ?
This video is sponsored by the Abyss... No one knows what it is or why it exists.
Happy for you girl
Yess Micarah! 💗 love the makeup too :)

I am so excited for you and I cannot wait to see how you decorate your house!!
You make my day a little more happier with your happiness thannkss🐥

So cuteeeeeee jesus

She looks genuinely happy, im hsppy for your upbringing Micarah, because you have a good and positive spirit, you deserve everything good in this world  🖤
I'm sweating from my eyes
that was so cute omg so hapy for you and your new house
I'm so Happy for you!!!!!!!
Seeing you this happy, makes ME very very happy! <3 you absolutely deserve every inch square of this house and yard and your RVs ;P
Brooo how did you train your birrrddd
iam so proud of uuu!!! u tottaly deserve this :)
i am so happy for you! you are one of those youtubers that is so genuine, and have worked so hard for your following. you deserve this house more than anything and i can't wait to see new content with it!
So proud of you!!! 💕
YAY SHE’S BACK!
.... I wish I had come across that deer in a wig. Also, please put a wig and lashes on that deer head
Im so happy for youuu!!! ❤❤ and also... SHE SUMMONED GARIAN!! 😂
The house is beautiful 😳
I want a house I can host regency and Victorian tea parties at
I read the title and i was shoooketh-
The lashes 😂😂😂😂
Micarah you say you don’t deserve this, but that couldn’t be further away from the truth. You are SO incredibly talented, funny, creative, intelligent, and if anyone deserves this, it has to be you!! I’m so so so happy that you’re happy. thank you for making me laugh and inspiring me to be unapologetically myself, you’re one of my favorite content creators, hope I get to continue watching you grow🤍
So sorry that people were stalking you
So happy for you Micarah!!! :)
WAIT this was the house on her previous video omg ✨foreshadowing✨
But why do people do creepy stuff like stalk you?
micarah posing on the patch of sunlight is so stunning ✨✨
i just realized the couch cushions are uneven
the pure happiness on her face is so satisfying!! I feel bad for you about the creepy guys though, hope you're doing better :D
i was watching this my mom and she said that her joy is just radiating through the screen.
That’s crazy that the one you wanted has been on the market for a while! Sometimes little things like that make me feel like Jesus is saying “ I want you to have this.” So excited for you! Plus not having a mortgage will be worth more than a $1 million dollar home. It’s such a blessing
Congratulations on getting a house!!!
Watching this video warmed my heart! Congratulations on becoming a home owner!
YAYYYYY!!
Micarah only YouTuber’s sponsors I don’t pass because they’re generally entertaining. If you know what I’m trying to say
you are the most wholesome person on youtube seeing you happy makes me happy
I'm so happy for you!!!! You deserve every bit of it
Kinda disappointed finding out the house wasn’t three or four RVs welded together to be honest.
i’m an idiot and didn’t even think that you bought a house last video, congrats on fooling one person
You really do deserve it Micarah! Just look at how talented and hardworking you are! And,Happy Women's Day,Congratulations on buying the new house!💗
The house is beautiful, you deserve it!!!
I- I was literally up until 2am thinking you broke into a house and how you could be in jail- I-
0:35 i LOVE the colour coordination
Im so happy for you. Watching this vid makes me smile.😊 enjoy your house ❤
Hey guys I'm not one to start rumors but ... I think Micarah got a house
I don't have time to watch the video but congrats my girl.. I'm so happy and excited for you... I'll be back when I have time to watch the video..
I actually got so giddy for you, seeing how excited you were during the house tour!!  (You should definitely start your own tour guide company called 'Micarah Tewers tours) You do deserve it, you've been such a huge inspiration to me, and I think you deserve all the things. Except for the stalking, that's not cool.
Micarah matching her new interiors in the frames 🤩❤️🤍🤎 edit: cannot not add how happy I am for her
This video gave me all the feels!! I'm so happy for you!!
Wowwwwwwwww you did it girl! I pray when I start my channel I be as successful as you
I'm so proud of you ;-;
Congrats :) I'm happy for you :)
“I have a closet in my closet” that is all you need.
It's an end of an era!!! The RV times have ended, now I'm highly expecting you to now walk around this damn mansion dressed in a bright pink floofly millionaire dressing gown with Garrion perched majestically on your shoulder... Or head.
I am so happy for you! Congratulations love, you deserve it. ❤️💕
I’m so happy for you! I only discovered your channel last year but you have become my absolute favourite YouTuber since then! Thank you for the laughs, and inspiration and joy your videos have given me! 🥰
Congratulations!!!! Super happy for you. Your joy brings us joy and you work hard to spread that joy. You deserve this :)
"I don't deserve this" you enjoy so much happiness, we are all so delighted for you!
I bought an appointment last November. I know that feeling so well. Just lay down on the floor and spread out. Take in the sights and smells of your own home. Also high five for sewing room. I got one too. Oh! Don’t forget to get a chest freezer to store the dismembered bodies of eatable plants.
As someone who is also young and unlikely to ever own property I am so happy for you and your new house is gorgous
"I don't believe in sidewalks..."    xD
Congratulations girl!
I've never been simultaneously jealous and extremely happy for someone at the same time, so yay.
You are amazing and deserve every ounce of success that you have earned! :)
Congratulations!!! 🎉
I'm watching a video on how to dissect a frog in science rn, but this is better.
It's so gorgeous omg you deserve it and it fits you so well! Also damn I want a second bedroom for a closet I have 2 roommates in a 1 bedroom apartment should I move to Ohio where I can afford more than like 400 sq ft?
Congrats Micarah for buying your first house!!!!
Omg I can’t with 🤡🥶
Congratulations! Now do you feel like a big girl?

OMFG THE ADS ARE KILLING ME😂😂😂
She does so much effort for her sponsors!!!
I READ THE TITLE AS "I BOUGHT A HORSE" LMAO-
It’s the bird in the bank for me
I am happy for you!!
I can't tell if the editing has gotten better or if I've just rewatched her videos too many times and I'm used to it. I think it's the former.
YAY MICARAH!! CONGRATULATIONS!!!
CONGRATS GURL
if she finds a dead animal on the side of the road she should dress it up as a cop #can't touch this😂
I'm so happy that just by watching I helped you fulfill a life dream!! I'm so happy for you!  💕💕
This is my favorite video!! 😍
Love you're new house! anyone else still living with their parents { new subscriber check✨✨✨🎇🎉 }
❤️❤️❤️
Yay im so happy for you i cant wait to see how you decorate your new house ☺
congrats girl 💗💗
Girl, you're awesome and sweet. Not to mention a competitive saver, so of course you deserve a house that makes you happy. The year's still young, so kick it off with a bang! (A good bang like confetti bang n-not a bad one...like fire-bom-you get what I mean)
Why is your joy so contagious! I love it! 🥰 Congratulations! You deserve a house that makes you as happy as you are right now!
so are u guys just ignore how one reason she wanted to move was bc OF CREEPY GUYS???
Congratulations  Micarah  I’m so happy for you 🥳 also you outfit is really cute 😊
MICARAH YOU ARE TOO CUTE IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU
I Love the old Time Rock n Roll in socks with no pants reference so much! This is literally what I feel like doing everytime I am alone in some place lol
I don’t know what state you live in that it’s illegal to take pictures or video of the house you’re touring because you’re considering purchasing it but that’s not the case in Illinois. Or Indiana. Or New York. I’ve looked for houses in all of those states and taken pictures and video. Someone lied to you.
Is it weird if I say I'm proud of you? And I think you deserve your own house? Your videos are such a gem among the trash YouTube has to offer. I love your humor, your cheerful personality, and the dresses you make.
i don't know why but you are the first youtuber that makes me happy when they make a video about buying new house
This video is filled with a lot of joy and that is very uplifting :)
I can't wait to have my own home. I live with my parents too.
Wait, risky business?
Please invite me to the regency tea party thank you I love dressing up 🥲🥰
Congrats!!! :)
so happy for you 🤗🥳
Seeing her happy makes me happy😭❤️
Congratulations! I’m jealous of your neighbors
I like your sofa  Edit: Micarah you deserve this so much lysm ✨

I'm so happy for you!! Like literally!! ❣️❣️❣️✊😔
I am so happy for her that I feel like I bought a house😭
What are dipping eggs??
I  am soooo happy for youuu🤗
Love that she bought a house! Hate that one of the reasons is stalker fans😕
hi side note, can you strip the sofa cushion covers. Please. please. Im begging you. green machine tf out of the rest of it. please. (please)
But does he offer you deviled eggs? Because I'm down with that and would never leave.

I NEED a deer in a wig
i am so incredibly happy for you!!!!!!!!
The beginning Lmao like all her videos 🤣🤣😂😂

Forever my favorite YouTuber! Haha! So funny. Just the best. ❤️ Congrats on your new home!
it's really great to see Micarahs work flourishing and all the work she's done to make the videos and she's doing something that makes her smile and recieves the things that make her smile (aka the house and much much more)
YOUR HOUSE IS SO BEAUTIFUL AND HAS SO MUCH CHARACTER OMG
You are really good at making the ads entertaining lol

We're gonna riot if you don't invite Karolina Zebrowska to your Victorian tea party
This is the most beautiful video I've seen ALL WEEK!! *CONGRATS!!*

You should do a house renovation video hgtv style

I'm so happy for you..God bless you dear 💖💖🌸🌸☘☘  Love from India 🇮🇳
Congrats!!! 🎉break a bottle of champagne...ah no that’s when you buy a boat😜🍾

Omg are you ok?!?! at the end of the video the worst thing happened to you! YOU STUBBED YOUR TOE ouchhhh
I'm so happy for you
I love this for you 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
im so jealous and proud of you. you've grown so much the past years! I'm worried for my own future, I want to be like you but everyone is just becoming a star on the media and I think that's so boring. I don't want to go to college as I'm so insecure about money. But I enjoy watching your videos
So happy for you! Glad you were able to find something you live and hope to see renovation videos soon!
i want to drink cake
rich queen omg so happy for you its so cute
You do deserve this! Just because you enjoy your work doesn't mean it isn't work! So happy for you!!!

sir i'd like to live with you
the way i’m so emotionally attached to this human i don’t know that seeing that she got a house put i’m in a happy and excited mood
What i find absolutely funny about this is that my mom just got a new house
I'm so jealous of that house, it is so cute! I can imagine how much fun you're going to have renovating/customizing it
The most unique way to tell your subscriber that you bought a house
Happy for u. U deserve that house. U work hard at enjoying life and u make us smile.  Thanks for being u. We love u
the most precious thing i've seen all day
im so glad for you!! the house looks Amazing, i cant wait to see how you style it to host victorian tea parties ☕🍰
Some how her voice really manages to calm me down lol 😆
You deserved it some much and I am so fucking happy for you. People like you make this world a better place, please don’t ever stop being you ❤️
Congratulations on the house!   I'm sorry about the creepy people you had/have to deal with. I hope you and yours are safe.
The absolute maximum level of joy and chaotic good energy radiating from this video warms my distressed soul
did you find princess dairies online for free to watch?
YOUR DAD DOESNT BELIEVE IN REINCARNATION!!!??!?!?!!!?!?? asfj$#fkkk@###@!!&$#**!!!
OML!
Im genuinely so fkin happy for you micarah <33333
Micarah!!! Can you do an inspired look on the character Georgia from the new Netflix show Ginny & Georgia!!??
"I don't believe in sidewalks"
My dad also offers me scrabbles eggs everyday. Slight problem: I’m allergic to eggs…
I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU IT FITS YOU SO WELL ❤❤❤
Haha, and i thought you broke into a strangers home to film the last videos ending. Im kidding, I love you micarah! 💕
Your enthusiasm for your house is just too wholesome
Am I the only one who cried a little at the end?
Congratulations, Micarah! You deserve it! I can't wait to see what you do with the place. <3
Congrats Macarah buying ur first house is a big accomplishment
🥺 so happy for you <3
It's no house, it's a Garion Palace. congrats!
“I’m very particular on which laws I break...” 😂
awww how cool is that. It's literally my dream to have a house, but I don't have a successful youtube channel or a successful career in any way, shape or form (I don't even have a job...) so I dunno if that's ever gonna happen... Maybe when I'm in my 40s lol
looks like someone is obsessed with the titanic recently
Okay so I was having a horrible day, and then I watched this and seeing Micarah so happy made my day a whole lot better. I feel happy too now.
why is the ad like half of the video I-
Why are so many of my faves from Ohio? 🤔 Also, why does your piano look like the Twenty One Pilots one. Is it an Ohio thing?
I dare to say Micarah is the first who ever fall in love to a house 🤣🤣
When your from Iraq: ..guys!!! We've been noticed!!!😭🐈😺
Hey I'm totally not one of the creepy followers! Please invite me to your house! Please, please, please, please, please :)  Okay actually you seem so happy and I'm really proud of you! I'm already waiting for the next videos in your house!
I love how the video is exactly 13:59 long LOL
why does micarah's hand have better makeup skills than me? i guess I need to buy some glamnetics *wink*
Almost this entire video I could not stop staring at the beautiful red pillows 😍😍 I need them I'm my life
I lived with my parents until I was like 24. I graduated from college and started teaching so I lived with them for my first three years of teaching and saved most of my paycheck until I was able to afford to move. I agree that if it is an option you should def stay with your parents until you have the money to move!
I thought i was the only one who was obsessed with Zillow, I'm glad Micarah is suffers the same addiction!
This made me so happy! Congratulations on the new home!!!!!
So wholesome, must protect! Congratulations. Prayers for peace and safety ❤️👏😇
I’m so excited to see all the ways you decorate your house!
-Semi vow-     the motto every homeschooler lives by...
I'd never skip any ad/sponsorship in your vids.
OH MY GOSH!!!! SHE HAS A HOOOOOOOOOOOUSE!!!!!!
Despite the questionable legality of Micarah putting a wig on that recently deceased deer, one would still have to say that said deer had a better bidet than the handful of problems Micarah's hand puppet of Jack from Titanic had remaining on that sponge.
Oh Micarah I'm so happy for you!!! Congratulations!!!
This just made me so happy watching her being excited about buying a house. YOU DESERVE THIS!!!
This is so wholesome and well deserved, can’t wait to see what more you’ll do!!
this is actually so CUTE HAHAHHA
Soooo happpy for you!!!!!
I love that this makes her so happy, it’s makes me happy seeing her happy lol. I hope you have fun in your new glamorous house!
That tv at 12:01 that is amazing
Congratulations
5:32 Ooh!! Can you invite me Micarah? If we joint host, we can make it a thing and call it the mica(ra)h parties.
she's so creative😂
I am so happy for you! 💙💙💙
So cute, I'm happy for you !!
YOU DESERVE THISSSS
Omg OMG today when I got on YouTube, I knew it, I could feel it Micarah had uploaded a video, it’s a sacred day ! 😌🤗🥳
Why is no one talking about the lashes it looks so cool or they've been here for years and i just didnt know🤡
I'm so happy for you! I'm trying to save for my own house, so thanks for the inspiration!
the last 15 seconds are simply the most adorable thing ive ever seen its so crazy that im so happy for someone ive never met
I did play Old Time Rock n Roll during the last clip and I must say it was 100% worth it even though I couldn't understand a word of what you were saying and I didn't know when to stop playing the song so maybe in your next video you could tell us when to turn off the music because I don't want to hear it while sleeping, thank you dear crazy lady
Congrats on getting a house!🥳
omg that house is so cute congratz Micarah!!! Really thrilled to be here to witness the process of you making home of that place 🏡❤
I was afraid of taxes
The amount of effort you put into your  videos and YOU thank US? Congrats on the house!
I’m happy for you Micarah
Her being giddy about the house brings me joy. Looks like it was worth every penny 😊✨
I am very happy for you. And you do deserve this. Congratulations!
Micarah, that roadkill story.. eh that was actually really sad for me because many animals are hurt by cars and left to die, for hours or even days in pain with for example broken bones ;< My kitty was hit by a car and this person ran away, my sister found her after few hours and it turned out she had broken spine. She was on the road with broken spine in incredible pain. My vet clinic tried to save her for 3 days. I have seen many animals that were hit by vehicles and left to die like that, I don't see joy in that, this is a proof of pure human brutality and huge pain of animal
So happy for you😊👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Get you some lashes that are (literally) more likely to stick around than Jack from Titanic
Her: gets house, and films in it, everyone noticing   Me: *...wait she bought a house? I thought she just used someone elses 👁👄👁*
Congrats!! I just found my house at the end of 2019, and immediately touring it I knew it was the only house for me! I also lived at my parents until I was ready- post 30yo...
I don't know how, but the sponsor moment always catches me with the guard low.
Ive never met anyone in my life with as much personality as this girl
Are you gonna get chickens?
It's the instagram of responsible adults  The "adults" in instagram    *LOOK AT MY ASS IM BETTER THAN U*
Micarah: "i'm afraid of debt" Me: *laughs in medical student*
OMG CONGRATS but your R.V was better like totally pfft
I AM SO HAPPY FOR YOU. ITS SO BEAUTIFUL. I love how open it feels TT W TT I aspire.
Congrats!!! You definitely deserve this. Enjoy it! 💛🧡💛
I'm so happy to see you happy ( so much happy going on xD) My point is that it's great that you have a space of your own and your dream has come true well, at least one of them I guess. Anyways congratulations! And Happy Women's Day!
Congratulations!!!!! I am so so happy for you!!!Enjoy!
tbh I think mortgage is a worldwide fear
Fun Facts- Don’t freaking stalk Micarah. Just Wrong.
If there's an echo I read on Twitter that you can put a rug down
Awweeee! I'm so happy for you! Congrats!! <3
IM SO HAPPPYYYYY FORRR YOUUUUU!!!!!!!!!!
Congrats to your new home!!!  That house definitely needs a new dog too! You know, to guard that house and keeps weird ones away.  I can bark ma'am.  OWA OWA!!!
I'm gonna cry for her
❤️💜❤️💜❤️💜❤️❤️💜❤️💜❤️
Congrats on your beautiful victorian house on Bleep Street!
Girl congratulations 🎊
I'm so happy for you, and that part of "leave the parents' house when you're comfortable" speaks to me, in my country I would never be able to find a place even half as great as yours, we're condemned to the small hamster cages at ridiculous prices :'( Sadly I'll have to choose something very soon, and is very unlikely that I'll find the dreamhouse...
In the last video, it didnt even cross my mind that you bought a house😂 it was just micarah in a random empty house. No questions are asked😂😂
I love to see my favourite Disney princess succeed, congrats!!!!!!!! You´re amazing!!!!!
Haha, last video was 14:01 and this video was 13:59 XD. I guess she still doesn't have a video that is exactly 14 minutes long
Why am I so excited for a woman I will never meet (I live in Ireland) and who I will never know (again, IRELAND) on her new house with her Bird??? BECAUSE IT IS YOUTUBE's MOST WHOLESOME, FUNNY YOUTUBE PERSON! Congratulations Micarah!!!!
Girl... who says you don't deserve to own a house. You spent your hard-earned pennies on that bad boy, you deserve every square inch of that that house, flaws and all.   P.S I'm so jelly, that's such a cool house.  P.P.S This video has inspired me and motivated me to try harder at saving my money so maybe one day I can do the same and buy a cute house to call my own and decorate it however I please, that's the dream... unless you're my dad in which case driving through a car park space so you don't have to reverse out is living the dream.
So so happy for you and hope you feel safer!
wowowwo the house is so big and nice! im excited to see the transformations
Yess! So proud of my favorite YouTuber!:)
I'm feeling excited just watching you show off your house. At the same time it kind of makes me want to cry?  Congratulations on your new house!!!
I’m so happy for you!! My husband and I bought our first house in October of last year and this just reminded me how much I loved buying my own house 😊 congratulations!
So sorry to hear about creeps invading your privacy and threatening your safety 😡 i hope this gives you more peace of mind!!
ok so she bought TWO RVs, and now a HOUSE?! this is very exciting news
Garion's must be so excited: "Look at all this SsspPAAaAaAaAAaAcCCEEe I have to fly around in!"
This girl's personality is GOLDEN!  btw: U inspired me to get a parakeet. His name is Limon, he says hi...well more like screams hi
I'm so happy for you :,)  Congratulations Micarah! 💘💘💘
Hahahaha congratulations 🎉 I love your videos!!! Keep doing what your doing girl !!!!!
I'm not a creepy one! invite me! It's super safe especially since I probably won't even come because I live in Canada
The only ads I like are: Micarah’s sponsorships   And flex tape
YOU DESERVE THIS ❤️
Look at her! She’s so happy! That makes me happy! I’m so happy for you girl, way to go! ❤️
I keep forgetting this video has a purpose i just got lost Also pls can u make a video of ur favorite outfits and outfit ideas?? I loveeee ur outfit in this vid
This is adorable and wholesome! I would buy that house too, no joke 💕

WOW WHO COULD HAVE SEEN THIS HAPPENING
it’s so pretty i’m obsessed!!!! so deserved!!!
So I had wandered down the alley of songs like Cradle by sub urban but I wanted to see something not quite so dark before I went to sleep cause then I get nightmares, so came to Micarah's video and yeah... It's all good now so goodnight everyone :D
Soooo happy for you! So proud of you! You do deserve that! You are modest selfless and like real life princess. Forst video of you i watched was you making cindrella dress so i guess you got your own castle! Can't wait to see you sawing curtins and doing makover of hpuse. I hope you'll make video on that! Enjoy your happines i am happy with you!
petition for Micarah to make one of the rooms a bird room.
sooooooo Proud of you!
0:57 making scribes on dollars isn't a crime
Yay congrats!!
13:21 Tom Cruise !!!
Wait....can you even put wheels on a two story house?
Oh my gosh Micarah! Yaaaay!

Go Girl... Soon you will buy a villa..... Maybe
I'm jelly       JELLY BEANS
IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU EEEEEEEE
Only channel where I dont abuse the forward button during sponsorship.
Don't ever tell yourself you don't deserve this place. You worked for it. You got your sponsorships, you made your content, you do all your editing, you engage with your audience, you've put up with invasions of privacy (had to pause the video and take a walk around the house when you talked about that because *WHY DOES THIS HAPPEN TO EVERY SINGLE YOUNG WOMAN ON THIS DAMN PLATFORM* ???) and what have you done with it? You've invested in your future by buying a normal, family home! Other Youtubers your age with your momentum are up and moving to LA in flex mansions they can't afford. You *deserve* this house Micarah. Don't talk yourself out of believing it.
Oh my god I love how happy she is!!
What's with the "posting only once a month" thing with Youtubers whose content I enjoy?  I'm not trying to be mean, we miss it really.
So happy for you, I have been watching you for 2 years and you deserve it. One new address today, keeps the creepers away.
I read the title and though it was about another RB🤣
The house looks really nice, the wooden floors ♥.♥ . I've been dreaming of having my own house for a while now, but will have to wait some time until I actually have money to do so. Your excitement is really nice to watch, gets me excited. I think when I will buy a house in the future I will be as excited as you are. (I've been traveling around a bit today and was actually looking at houses and thinking what stuff I liked about it).
i cried of joy, i'm so happy for you micarah!!
Last time I was this early to something, I took a nap in my car and then was late to it 😕
4:56 "tewers" my mind is blown
Meow
OMG congrats gurrlll! Just wiping some blood off of my ears...
Been watching since that first prom dress video and man oh man you absolutely deserve it <3 congrats!!!
she is probably one of the small amount of people on yt that i'm geniually happy for XD the rest i kinda don't give a shit about ...but she is a bundle of joy! Congratulations on your new house :D
Yyaaayy!
I gasped
you are the most deserving human-youtuber that has ever existed, now please make a haunted house-house in halloween when you can.
You're the only YouTuber whose sponsors I sit through.
in honour of international womens day, maybe the creepy stalkers could do micarah a favour and BOG OFF <3
Just watching this made me so happy 😊
nooooo i thought u and garian were rv dwellers oh well the house is lovely micarah congrats
Congratulations!!! 🎉
Omg!
Oh my, you're too darn cute (not in that creepy way stalker-ish way (im not the ones you're talking about!), but in that female-supporting-another-female-girlpower-way) im just gonna stop talking... You just look so happy, congrats!!
Congrats blonde woman and bird.
Im so happy for you <3
SO HAPPY FOR YOUUU
So happy for you!!! Congratulations!!! :)
That in debt aversion is the most rational fear I've ever come across.
I'm SO happy for you, sweetheart!! ❤️❤️ God bless you even more!
I'm convinced your house is just two RV's stacked on top of each other in a trench coat, but ok.
So incredibly happy for you, Micarah!! Thank you for always putting a smile on my face!! You deserve everything!:)
I’m in class and I saw this and was like I NEED TO WATCH THIS💜💜
Congrats!
I actually choked on my saliva from spontaneous laughter watching her ad for magnetic lashes
Oh my god!!!! Congradulations❤❤❤❤
You do deserve this 💛
I am so beyond proud and happy that my time wasting my life on YouTube means Micarah can buy two RVs and a house and live her life mortgage free. All that time wasn’t wasted at all! And tbh it was never a waste anyway because Micarah could never ever be a waste of time and don’t let anyone ever tell you otherwise! Anyways go you Micarah! I love you!
this is the emptiest i have ever seen a space with micarah in it.
Has an entire aside about how putting wigs on deer makes people laugh and then doesn't put a wig on her taxidermied deer head ;_;
Congrats on the new home!!! Here's a virtual house warming gift 🍾🎄🪴
It took over a year for a an rv make over video,  how long will it take for the this house remodel video?
I saw the title and went “WHATT?!!” How could she be ever buy a house while having a frickin’ RV?!
I actually choked on my saliva from spontaneous laughter watching her ad for magnetic lashes
I love your new house!  I'm really proud of where you are, and you deserve it. Plus, that titanic segment with the hand lashes was brilliant.  You demonstrated the power of the product in a genius way by attaching it to your hand and making me care about your 12 second old child.  Keep doing what you do!
This probably the most wholesome thing i've seen in a week. Thanks for this micarah, you deserve it, and i wish you more blessings.
“I’m very particular about which laws I break” big relate
So happy for you!!!
Dear Micarah Im glad to say i found you very early in your youtube carrier, and i know you edit your videos and we only get to see what you want us to see, but from distance and viewer perspective i just want to express how happy i am for your achievement. You are truly a special person, and also your friends and family, to me is awesome you let us see a little of your colourfull life and feels like sunshine, in the internet world there are many people who gets attention, but you should be truly proud of who you are, because thats the charming of your channel, so so so happy for u, i cant only imagine how much joy your house is bringing you, and how proud your parents must be. You deserve it keep being an inusual but awesome person
comgratulations! also, men watching this, DONT FUCKING GO TO HER HOUSE
Ever wish: *Damn I wish I wrote that comment*
yes yes yes imma speak it into existence: house renovation vids !!!!!
AWWW
I'm so proud of you 💜💜💜
I know I've never met you and probably never will, be can we all agree that Micharah feels like family? I'm really happy for you! Congratulations on the new house! :)
so like... wheres my diamonds?
that smile on her face is so infectious im so proud of how far this girl has come
YAY YOU FINALLY BOUGHT A HOME WITHOUT WHEELS
Micarah got house !!! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh. You need to make an decorating my house series. PLZ DO !❤❤
Congratulations!
I'm so happy for you! :)  Can't wait to see what shenanigans you get up to!  <3
yeahooo so glad for you girl!!!!!
Well, she bought her house. My question is are the chickens coming with
Instructions unclear: what do I do if I have a fear of mortgage AND clowns?
micarah talking about her sponsors is so funny, i don't even want to skip it also, I'm happy for you!!!! I'm hoping you'll make vlogs or other kinds of video decorating the house and all that
I share your excitement. I am very happy for you.
Is it weird that I got a little teary eyed watching how happy you are? Probably...Well at least that means I’m not one of the creepy viewers..just one of the empathic ones..so happy for you 💛!
Im so happy to see that my comment from two years ago on the chicken feed bag video which states: "
Congratulations! I bought a house this year too. But mine has a big mortgage payment to go with it ;). Happy for you. Buying a house in cash is very Dave Ramsey of you.
Got notif and said WHAT 😄🥰
Ok I am early finally also love your videos
So happy for you 😊😊
maybe it’s because I’m not from the Midwest but what is DIPPING EGGS
1) I’m so incredibly sorry ppl have done that to you.  2) tiny houses/small houses are the bomb. They feel like home. I live in a small house and it’s plenty for me and the kitchen is like tiny but it screams home then anyone that sees it loves the kitchen.
The fact that someone at glamnetics had to watch and approve this video.
AAAAAHHHHHH IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU, I HOPE BIRB BOI MEMORIZES THE HOUSE LAYOUT SOON  I'm moving to a house next weekend so I share your hype!!!!!! I'm so excited!!!
So happy for you 💖 well deserved Also me: crying in broke millennial
congratss Micarahh 🤩 this video really motivates me :))
I wish to own my own house soon....cmon cmon cmon good juju vibes✨✨✨✨
this is so wholesome
OMG I literally watched Titanic for the first time two days ago so I was able to get the joke!! lol
Watching you smile made me smile even more! I’m super super happy for you Pretty Girl, even tho you might not see this but GOD IS GOOD and continues to shine in you!! Have a great day !! ❤️❤️🥰
SO PROUD OF YOU SINCERELY, a subscriber since 22k subs
Ah, I’ve been subscribed since since “Making a dress out of bird feed.” I gotta say, being with you since then has been a journey. I’m grateful that I could. With the boom in popularity, I felt jealous because now the best kept secret in YouTube was out. But, as mundane and weird as this may sound, (and you’ll probably never see this,) I’m proud of you. Great job Micarah! You are mah hero.  (*^▽^*)
I was NOT prepared for this.
I love it how it is 14 minutes again
Congratulations!  It is beautiful and I’m looking forward to seeing how it continues to transform.
How sweet
That home was built before 1910?! No way...
the titanic scene-
Omg! I’m so proud of you!! I started watching you when you were under 100k! I showed my friends your Cinderella video when you went bowling and I was cracking up the whole time... they weren’t... oops! Anyways I still always crack up! I guess humors different to everyone HAHA anyway.... I’m so happy for you, you deserve it 🥺💖💖
HOW DID YOU TRAIN YOUR BIRD NOT TO POOP EVERWHERE ISTG
pov- your watching this in math class :)
YASSSSS!!
Why am I in love with your house?
Congrats 🎈🎉🍾🎊 💖🧋❤️
So so happy for you Micarah, congrats ! Your video gave me such a huge smile, you're The Best (unfortunately, my mouth is rather small so I lied, it was a reasonably sized smile) Also thanking you for what you said about not letting anyone shame you for still living with your parents - I needed to hear that <3
the fact that micarah's hands are moving so satisfyingly is kinda weird.
Im so proud!!! 🌺 Greetings from Serbia!
MICARAH I'M SO FLIPPIN HAPPY FOR YOU!!!!! ENJOY YOUR HOUSE GIRL!!!!
This made me want to buy a house too  It looks so fun  But im 16, unemployed and also irrationally afraid of debt so its going to take a while
Omg I've seen your dads doppelganger, he lives in southern Sweden
I LOVE UR ADS ALSO CONGRATS
Big congratulations!
WHY DID I READ IT AS HORSE NOT HOUSE AND GET SO EXCITED
Can you film the process of you fixing up the house. We would love to see it
Wow! So sad you've had to deal with such creeps and stalkers. I'm glad you've bought a new house and that you're safer now but it really sucks that you and your family had to deal with that.❤❤
tell me why i read this as "i bought a horse" at first and didnt even question it
I'm sooo happy for you ☺ 😁🥰
I'm so happy for you!!!! :0 also i'm sorry that people can be creeps :( we will protec you

Bruh I find this video so inspiring😄
Congrats!!!!!
this is the best youtube video i have seen in months!!!! thank you and congratulations!

You ABSOLUTELY deserve this <3
girl your sponsorships are always so entertaining, i never skip them lmao
I'm so happy for you! You do deserve it, you wonderful, wholesome human being.
Although I’m never sure what I am about to watch with your videos, I am always so entertained. My attention span goes about 1 minute and somehow I watch every video until the end. You are awesome
is the door under the stairs the front door?
CONGRATS MICARA
You have amazing taaaste
When Micarah Tewers and Tom Scott post at the same time. 👀
I love youuu!
Can't wait to receive my invitation to Victorian tea time at Tewers Manor !!
I am so happy for You, congrats! At the same time I am worried because while ago I was wondering if some creeps from YT are stalking You and how You deal with that. I am glad You moved somewhere else but I hope Your family is safe too ✌❤
Congrats about the house and being able to pay cash! I finally got my own appartment last year and I still just walk into a room and think "that's mine". Hope you'll get a lot of joy from renovating!
So happy for you! 🤍
This was a love letter to your house, wasn't it
You can tell how happy she is... I’m so happy for you❤️
yeey
Your videos make me laugh on a sad day.
I thought I was the only one who re-enacted Titanic scenes!
You’re so happy! We’re all very glad that you are able to achieve this milestone and we can’t wait to see your first creations in your new home!!!

it is currently 12AM here and im watching this and i have class tmr....and man i just wish my life will hold on like how micarah's lashes hold on to her eyelids 👁👄👁
Imagine watching this video in the living room with people passing by....how are you going to explain that the two hands acting out a titanic scene is normal here🙂
Micarah is the only person who can make a paid promotion funny and enjoyable to watch! HEY ADVERTISERS: THROW MORE MONEY AT HER!!!!
AH that's awesome congrats!! so surreal  -estate :)))
I have seen your home on video SO MUCH - and never thought to look up your address....some people have no life. Stay safe queen.
No pude parar de sonreír en todo el video, i´m so happy and proud of you, you really deserve this <3
I smiled through out this whole video
The patches of sunlights were so pretty on you wtf
For a second I read that as horse and thought she was going to make a dress for a horse
Ur look in this video kind of reminds me sabrina spellman. Sorry not sorry 😝
"That's a flaw. I like flaws. Nobody likes perfection" I wish that was my yearbook quote  Hope you're safe btw :3
I honestly should have dropped out of film school and learnt how to edit from Micarah’s videos.  This is the future of entertainment
I've been waiting so long for one of micarah's videos that I clicked on this immediatelyyy. Congrats on the house!!
i'm so happy for yooooou 💚

So what you're telling me is I still have to know how to put on eyeliner in order to use these lashes. I CAN'T DO IT MIXARA
“I don’t believe in sidewalks” my favorite line out of everything she has said today 😂😂

You inspire me to buy my own house😳  (way later in life since I'm only 16 rn😐)
Congratulations Micarah. You deserve your beautiful new home ♥️
aahhhh i cried watching this
OMG OMG congrats!!
Oi, No! You do deserve it! You put a lot of thought and effort into your videos, you even edit them yourself. Lots of credit where credit is due and a house is a lovely way for you to be rewarded for your life and choices.
Rule number one to any crime, never admit anything! Luckily you only said it here among the select few
ok so now she hase 2 RVS and 1 house ok sorry was confused
my heart kinda melted <3
Honestly the house looks so good. Im kinda jelly
11:38 Oh no big deal just Micarah being an actual Disney princess behaviour.
Make sure you install fire alarms, fire estinguisher, get house insurance and all that fun stuff! But congrats!!!! <3<3<3 luw u
You should train Garrian to become an attack dog to keep the creeps away 😁
yes, this is the only time i wont skip an advertisement in youtube videos, because you always make them fun and unique
4:19 THE TITANIC SCENCE 😭✋
You deserve this house :)
ugh im so happy for you Micarah!
I love this for you :)
//gasps// YOU ACTUALLY DID??? CONGRATS MICARAH!
Such cute emotions jest bursting out u that is extremely sweet wow ........
Bold of you to assume I don’t already watch my favorite movies at the nail salon I don’t do my nails, but that’s beside the point
I really love how happy you look in this video💜
I'm so happy for you! Congratulations :) I've really enjoyed watching your channel grow and im so happy to be here go watch as you continue your journey.
Congratulations!:))
woah
you SO deserve this. I am so happy for you! <3
This is so exciting I am 100% living vicariously through her joy
Now that's when you know you made it. 👍
"Won't show the front of my house"  *isn't that your front of your house in the thumb-nail?* 💀😂😂  Unless u used a stranger's house 😂😆
You are so precious <3 I'm so happy for you :')
I have never wanted to buy something sponsored more
GIRL CONGRATULATIONS IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU!
I’m so happy that Micarah is happy, she is so sweet and deserves that world
I literally am thinking to buy my own and I can totally understand it feelings 🎉🎉🎉🎉👍👍❤️❤️❤️❤️
more space for fabric
It's so beautiful, congratulations!!
So happy for you 💗
You 1000% deserve this your videos make me so happy well done on ur new home! 💘
Can I come over if I'm not creepy, but refuse to come over without bringing my cat? She loves birds...
Micarah looks so happy <3
Sidewalks are just a myth, kind of like ice.
uhhhhhhhhhhhh ive been waiting for thiss..... so happy!!
im so so happy for you i literally shed a tear at the end of this video
Mt biggest worry is she might decide to put wheels on her new old house.... Wait a minute best not give her crazy ideas!!!
Congratulations baby you are so sweet and amazing <3
I do not believe in happiness being brought by physical possessions... Just kidding real estate and cars do bring happiness, enjoy the house cause it's awesome.   (also sorry about the *bad reasons* why you had to move out, i guess it's to be expected on the internet, but if there's someone who doesn't deserve creeps and assholes going to her FKN house it's certainly you, your content is just educational, full of positive vibes and funny as hell without bashing others, not sure why there's still random creepy asshats dedicated enough to find your dad's house...)
the moment i read the title i felt a rush of excitement within my body
so happy for you <3
Very excited for a beautifully chaotic video of you redecorating and painting and making this house an antique wonderland coming soon ☺️💕
wtf i’m so proud of u
You do deserve this girl friend! Your videos are such a gift:) take care and enjoy your new home!
You deserve this so hard! I am so happy for you!
I'm just gonna wait for the renovation/decorating/furnishing videos
...can I have your rv then  Fr congrats tho!
That is such a beautiful house. I'm so happy for you! I hope I can have something of a similar build someday.
This is literally her being cute and excited for 14 minutes
Damn! I'm compelled to buy the damned lashes! 😂  Also, super happy for you and your happy house! 😍
I'm so proud of her omg 😭😍😭😍 our sewing mom has a house!!!
you absolutely deserve it!!
Its creepy with the people who stalk you, I hope you won't come across those kind of people again :/ anyway, congratulations on your house. :)
Where did you buy these shoes ? They're really beautiful
yAy
"I don't believe in sidewalks" 😂  I'm so happy for you! This is awesome^^
I’m so proud of you !!!
next video: House makeover!
Y’all BETTER respect her new address & not show up there. Micarah deserves nothing less than feeling safe and secure in her own home!
congrats you deserve it!!!

A regency tea party though! Best thing I’ve heard all day
"I don't have kids."  5 minutes later: "Come on, Grandpa!  Just kidding he's my dad."

hi :) im so boring but im earlyyyyyyyy
“You believe in reincarnation”  “...no but they might”
I may or may not have spent the entire second half of the video smiling like an idiot because you're so happy and I'm so happy for you :')
She's the only one who can make a sponsored ad worth watching ♥️♥️
i am glad a youtube career has helped a decent human being get a house in this economy, without having to exploit anyone.
I literally read the title twice before realizing its house and not mouse HAHAHAHAHAHAHA btw i love micarah so much not like seggsual but like a sister idol or someone but not seggsual ok HAHAHA  Edit: - You deserve it all
Oops. Just did some house shopping in Ohio and I guess I’m a total law breaker 😅
I'm so happy for you... You genuinely deserve all you've gotten thus far. Thank you for sharing your daring personality with the world and your budgeting fashion skills (sprinkled with skills of *life*).
This video is so wholesome, it comforted me in 14 minutes more than my parents did in 19 years
Congratulations girl . I'm so happy
It made me smile seeing Micarah so HAPPY, her happiness is really contagious!!!.... I wish one day I will find a house I love as much as she did!!!

For some reason, my brain couldn’t comprehend the idea of buying a house without a mortgage. Congrats, though, Micarah!!
I'm so happy for you! It's great to see you come this far since I started watching way before the first RV <3
You should make a video about each room you renovate and you moving in
i’ve went to 2 bathrooms at once.
You are probably the only youtuber I watch. But your videos are just so goood!
Good job! Congrats
I'm just sitting here with a big fat smile on my face, excited for someone else's house... What have you done to me?! So happy for you girl <3
Me with bleeding ears : I'm so proud of you :')

My friend told me she didn’t like micarah  She got run over by a bus  I lost my bus license that day .  Jk karens don’t come at me
Seems like Barbie finally bought the Dream house ! Love you Micarah <3 !
I loved seeing the pure joy and admiration that she has for her house, CONGRATS MICARAH!! <333
What happened to those 12 chickens and ducks that you bought a while back? I think it was your second prom dress video.
Sidewalks are an illusion
I love how happy she is! This is a big step for her and I'm glad to be apart of it!!!
Nice.

I AM SO HAPPY FOR YOU
You do deserve this! We’re so excited for you to have more than 2 Christmas trees width to work in 💕
the only youtuber i don’t skip the sponsored parts of
me seeing this title; OH MY GOSH MY GIRL IS GOING UP IN THE WORLD, FIRST RV'S NOW A HOUSE IM SO PROUD NJBHGVCFXDS
Congrats Micarah!!! You do truly deserve this. So happy for you!
Who are these people disliking the video of Micarah buying a house and being happy the whole time?!
your bank even moving to your house
queen i love how there is 1581 comments in 22 min
Congratulations! ✨ 🎉
Not you getting a house making me emotional 🤡✋
well congrats ma'am
Congratulations!!! So cool ...Cant wait to see what you do to it !!! 🥳❤️
13:22 is exactly like some dutch music video that was always on tv when i was a kid and i for the love of god dont remember who did it except that it was some famous dutch dude whom i also dont remember his sister
Okay but in your dad's defence, you guys DO ACTUALLY HAVE CHICKENS. It would be a crime to not constantly offer people eggs when you have an endless supply of them.
gotta applaud the sponsor portion being worthy of its own video. I couldn't get myself to skip it from all the turns it took. I don't even need glamnetic lashes
😫😫😫
your house is so pretty omg
omfg I never thought this would happen... good for you!
I am so sorry you had to deal with crappy fans stalking you. There ahould always be a divide between the fan and the creator. You are not there for us to push farther than simply enjoying your content and supporting you in any way you feel comfortable. There should never be an instance where "fans" go to your house ever.
Yassssssssssssss
It was “I don’t believe in sidewalks” for me hahahahaha
Congrats on having your own house, wish i will have mine in the future (which for 26yo should be now xD), we are so happy for you!!!!
🤣🤣🤣🤣
WTH
Bish said "financial stability"
Micarah is the only youtuber I'd watch a 5 minute ad for
AAAAAAAAAA  I just stabbed self with a fork
CONGRATS!
I saw the title and went, 'she did what now?'. Like, I don't even know why. It's something as simple as buying a house and my mind can't wrap the idea of Micarah moving out of her RVs into one. Those RVs will be missed but I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU! I literally smiled the whole time watching this, especially when she excitedly went 'I have a house' in the end
Oh my gosh i saw this video and started freaking out in a good way  Congrats hope you enjoy your new home We love u Micarah <3
who would've thought I'd cry over u getting a house
i'm so happy for youuuuu I can't wait for all the videos :)
Nice for you and happy women's day
My crippling debt and horrific clown phobia really got attacked somewhere round the 7 minute mark and if I weren't so entertained, I'd be offended or somethin
no cuz why did I think "she's pregnant" when you said you had news😭😭😭🤧🤧🤧
I’m so happy for you Micarah!
IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU <3333
I just want you to know we're all so proud of you, congrats you definitely deserve this!!  (also now you have no excuse for projects bigger than Ariana Grande's dress :) )
you should make a room a sewing area and you could paint the walls with your previous dresses and designs!
I couldn’t stop smiling ! I’m SO SO proud of you!  Also I whispered “micarah this is a lot of ads!! But it’s okay I understand houses are expensive”😂
I love how happy she is about a house :)
Congratulations, I'm so excited for the new decorating content 😊
If anyone is deserving of this Micarah is!
Micarah I am so happy for you and I love you so much! Have a great day!
YOU DESERVE IT BABYYYY!! also, can I mention that your camera isn't your iPhone anymore? we stan GROWTH
I'm so incredibly happy for you, you crazy person. 🎉😭
I'm not creepy! Invite me please!🙆‍♀️😂
Your adoration of this house is precious. Enjoy the journey of making it your own!
I always think about that “Instagram for adults”
Congrats on the new house! And hi to ur Birb :)
i'm not crying you are
Congrats!!!
WO! Congratulations on the house!! I'm so happy for you!!!
CONGRATS MICARAH! I just know God helped you get a house. I hope you enjoy this house! GOD BLESS YOU AND YOUR BIRRDDD!!
That house is gorgeous!! It has soooo much character! Great choice, Micarah!
It’s just so wholesome and happy, I’m dead. A lot of creators on here force smiles and don’t express true gratitude for their followers, but you can see on her face how genuinely happy, excited and grateful she is. You deserve the world Micarah 🥰
this one of the purest videos ive ever watched
Micarah, are you........ I can hardly say it.... Adulting?!
Our Snow White Micarah got a CASTLE?!?!
i’m very happy for u and ur house
This was the most genuine video I've watched on YouTube in a while
Yess

thankgod u posted..i was litteraly bout to kill myself coz of my exam
VERY happy for you Micarah!!!!! Such a beautiful place!
kryptonie
Micarah, look for some "edison bulbs" for your chandeliers. They look awesome in older homes especially with the wood floors and trim.
Congratulations!!
I'm so happy for you hope you make it perfect ❤️ praying to have my own one day xoxo 😘
I’m so excited for MICARAHHH this is so awesome
SO HAPPY FOR YOU!
YAAAAAASS
omg early
Micarah always coming through with the serotonin 🙏🏻 (Except when she mentions people stalking her YIKES y'all need to not do that 😬😱)
New houses are the best! Especially when you can make them your own! Wishing you fun times painting, changing, and altering your home!
Titels i also would have accepted without questioning it: "i bought a hearse" "i bought a horse" "i bought a hog" "i bought a hovercraft". At this point i'll never be surprised by anything you do ever again. And i mean that as a compliment 😘 Nice house, btw.
Congrats!🤗❤️
Furnished house tour house tour
Soooo are you gonna buy a horse next?  PS: Greetings from Germany 🇩🇪
If you ever needed a second bathroom, then get yourself a backyard porta potty 🤠
this is the wholesome content I signed up for...
Soo happy for you, you really deserve it!
At the end when she said "ily house" "you make me happy" i litterally said and i quote "awee im so happy for her she got a house that makes her happy 😁" ilysm! All of your videos make me want to learn to sew and you inspire me to make outfits! 😄 Edit: OMG IM CRYING TYSM FOR ALL THE LIKES!! 😭😭😭
i promise im not the creepy fans, please invite me :)
I've been watching your videos for a long time, at least it feels like a long time, and I am honestly very proud of you. I know that means practically nothing from a random person on YouTube, but I've watched you grow so much and im just so proud of all the things you have aNhieved and how big your following has gotten. P.S. this video was really cute and extremely wholesome
Best of luck on your new, used house. I hope you have many, many years of fun and decorating.
congrats micarah!! I am sooo soo happy for you and I was just grinning throughout the video and I love how happy you are at the end!!
I KNEW IT
I don’t even wear makeup let along false lashes but I need these
i'm happy for you! congrats, micarah! <3
Seeing you so giddy makes me so happy and now im gonna cry.
Beautiful house ♥️♥️♥️ are you going to have a house warming party with friends (I can see you doing that) have fun!  Ps. I want a video of you decorating it :)
I can't wait till you do a full decked-out house makeover! What a big accomplishment, super proud of you Micarah!
Omg micarah 💖💖💖
Congrats!
GIRL IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU
So are you going to drag the barbie car to this house and like turn it into a pool or bbq or something
OMG yes💖💖
You deserve it! Can't wait to see what you do with the closet inside your closet
honestly, I really thought it was going to be a third RV ! lol
How did you teach Garrian to fly to you when you call him?
Micarah has McMansion energy can someone get her a McMansion STAT 🏃🏾‍♀️
you go girl! good job making sure you're gonna be safe (and I'll pray that nothing major breaks - at least nothing that your dad can't fix)
Aww congrats! You got us all through the scariness of 2020, and you totally deserve it! I am excited to see how you decorate! Looking forward to a tour ❤️
If anyone deserves it you do!
I’m so happy for you queen
I´m so happy for youuuuuuuu <3
U bought a house ?
I'm so happy for you :)
youre the only one i dont skip the sponsor part 👉👈
Congratulations!!!
so cuteeee congrats!!
Congrats!! I just started watching ur vids btw. I love your personality and the dresses you make <3
Congratulations you amazing woman! ❤️👍🏼🤠
I came here when it said “9 Minutes Ago”
So happy for you. I’ve been watching you since your early days and have always loved seeing how you, your family and your friends are so unapologetically yourselves... Humble, open-minded and also hardworking. I’ve loved the tidbits of life you’ve shown us - thank you. Enjoy your lovely home THAT YOU PAID CASH FOR. Well deserved 🥲
Congrats bby!!!
I just realized that nothing makes me more happy than seeing people so happy they might die AAAH MICARAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHhh YAYY
Why did I read the title as "I bought a horse" and wasn't even surprised or excited 😂✋
So happy for you!!!
Congratulations Micarah!!! You look so happy!
IM SO PROUD OF YOU ❤️ HOORAY
This was very pure and joyful!!! I’m happy for Micarah and her house!!! Congratulations!!!
We've finally unlocked the secret of the last video
your dad really said ‘teardrop’ but as your 1890s father who loves eggs.
I would like to apply for the position of throwin hands with the guys making Micarah uncomfortable. Cause f** them
i literally spent 1 minute trying to come up with a funny comment but I give up I'm trying to watch this video without any distractions 😾
Congrats! Now you have more space to make more dresses with too much tulle!
GIRL CONGRATSSS!!!!
I love genuinely happy and excited she is in this :) you deserve it all
I love how excited she is!
Yay!
micarah's energy is so good. I love seeing her this happy because it makes me feel happy and I don't even know why. seeing this video just really brightened my day <3  also the house is SO PRETTY WOAH
I want to leave a comment. So here it is
When you were one of the 0.1% who thought it was a show house that a realtor friend let Micarah play in for an afternoon.... WHY DID IT NOT EVEN OCCUR TO ME SHE BOUGHT A HOUSE???   edit: mispelling house and having to edit it really only proves further my lack of brain function
okay seeing her so happy made me happy!
congrats 🎉🎉
I am so happy for her and her beautifully magnetic lashes!!!
Bro I live bear ohio like only 20 minutes from there
you make the sponsorship part so interesting. u are one of the very few people whose vdo i don't skip
This is amazing!! So proud of you!!
You're so cute! I'm so happy you bought a house! It looks amazing! I would totally do everything you do if I bought a house like that. Rollerskating inside. Goals!
This motivates me soooooo much. Congrats! ❤️
I knew it!! Congratulations!!! You seriously deserve it!🎉
IM SO PROUD OF YOU OMG   Also do you think you’d ever open a PO Box???? Since you have a lot of room in your house you could have a “letter room” and feel like a real Victorian wife as you receive letters and go “ugh, reading? then put them in the letter room. It’s worth consideration
I’m so proud of you
Ughhhh im so sorry men are men 😩 but I’m glad you got a cool place! Stay safe!
Omg you look so excited💖💕 im  happy for you
CONGRATULATIONS!!! I am so happppyyyy!!!!!!!!
My favorite part of a house is the door handle
Lol totally did not see this coming when i saw the end of the last vid😂
I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOUUUUU I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHERE THIS GOES!! also I don't even wear makeup or do my nails but I almost want to try glamnetic stuff because of you XD
micarah please dont ever show one sec of where you live. unknown ppl are scary when you really think about it 🥴 and also buy cctv or set up cameras. just stay safe
13:23 I'll be playing What a man gotta do, by the Jonas Brothers instead. I hope that's okay
gotta attach wheels on it now
AAAAA I JUST STARTED THE VIDEO BUT IM SO HAPPY FOR U!!
congratulations!!!! you do deserve it, girl! enjoy your new house 💜
I'm happy for her but it sucks that one of the reasons she moved was the creepy people. :(
they grow up so fast.
Your so happy so I’m happy
So happy for you woooah. We're  excited to watch you sew a dress again your new 🏠
I'm so happy for youuuuuu ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
i've been watching you for a year now and i am so proud of you and your achievements! i can't wait to see you succeed more in the future 💗 i'm a proud micarahcan!!
So when are you going to get some chickens for that house?
I would love to see a closet room that holds all your lovely outfits and dresses youve made, plus if you turn a bedroom into a giant closet, you can put that really pretty ariana grande dress on a mannequin to scare any burglars, because on a mannequin, it'll look like an entire person/fairy godmother iis there
Micarah Tewers?? More like Magnetic Tewers        ...its ok i'll show myself out
Congrats💗💗💗
You’re one of a kind! Sometimes I can’t believe a person can have a character/humor like yours. You should have your own show! 😄😍
This gives me mad "i can't wait to own a house and decorate it" vibes
I've been binging your videos all weekend when I by chance happened upon your hilarious and informative Little Women video. After going through the roller coaster of your delightful channel, I can say that I am genuinely so happy you were able to achieve your dream of buying a house (debt free!!). Your hard work shows and the positivity and hilarity your work spreads on YouTube is very much appreciated, especially during the pandemic. Congratulations :)
I can't think of the last time I felt so happy for someone on the internet. You seem so content, and you absolutely deserve it! <3
AHHHH IM SO HAPPY FOR YOUUUUUU!!!
You were the Queen of RV’s and now the Queen of houses 😂
IM SO INCREDIBLY HAPPY FOR YOU!! ❤
Congratulations! It’s beautiful!
OMG I'M SO FUCKING HAPPY FOR YOU... CONGRATULATIONS

Hi

YAS GOOD FOR YOU GIRL
Literally the only YouTuber I watch where I don’t skip over the commercial portion of the sponsored video. Like more people should sponsor her because the “commercial” she does will actually be watched because she’s hilarious and brilliant.

Its like watching my kid grow up 🥺  I'm 15
Sorry but the cops were called on you for wearing *costumes* ?
Awww. I’m happy that micarah is happy ❤️
As a subscriber she deserves to have a house, love you micarah
Idk why but seeing you so excited about buying a house makes me feel like a bought the house too. is that weird? lmao
I saw the thumbnail pic on insta and 100% thought it was a chocolate lollipop  that you had bitten into in front of someone's house ✌
I'm soo happy for you!!! We'll always be there to support you❤️ And f*ck those creepy guys, same thing happening to best dressed 🙄 Stay safe💜
Aww, Congratulations Micarah!  I am so excited for you!
the last part reminded me of the beginning of tangled, where she sings about all the stuff she does in a day
Sees that she has posted 15 minutes ago and just came from a long drive (aka 30 minutes) and too tired to watch it and it is all night in India it is 10:04 (as time) you shall be lucky to find this comment
You're absolutely worth all of this
I'm in the middle of moving myself in a pretty big house for someone my age so I can totally understnad how you are feeling right now, I can't wait to see you renovate it!
I think the house loves you too Micarah we all do! <3 . . . . . Unless your birb starts squawking in a frenzied panic for no apparent reason in which case GTFO your house is haunted 👍
I thought you got into someone's house to take the video lol
🥺🥺 this video makes me smile
Congratulations!! What a beautiful house!! When I searched for mine I also looked for one with a lot of character! I am excited to see all of your home projects.  =)
So happy for you Micarah! And so sorry that creeps have been...creeping. You keep on making the most of life girl! 😘
Literally 14:00 long, AGAIN. I love it.
Congrats!! I'm so excited to see how you decorate this house
this was so cute omg!!:') congrats on getting a gorgeous house♥️
SHE DID THE RICK ASTLEY 😂  AS IF SHE WASN'T ALREADY MY FAVORITE YOUTUBER!
YOU DESERVE A HOUSE
So proud of you, Micarah! You totally DO deserve it and it seems like such a nice place. I can’t wait to get my own home one day 😊
I bought a house! Surprise  Me: I think it's not much of a surprise....
Awwwww I know you think it's quite a luxury, but you've worked hard for that house and you deserve it! Congratulations Micarah! Hope Garreon likes the new layout!
Glamnetic lashes dont work for me. It geos on but the liner pops off the inner corners in less than 3 minutes every single time.
Omg I was so excited when you bought a house but I was very amazed with the Valentine’s dress it’s so cute! I love you channel! :D💝
For me, this was posted 14 minutes ago :>
It’s so cute seeing people in the honeymoon stage of homeownership. Enjoy it!
I'm not creepy😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐
I can’t believe she finally bought a house!!! I’m so excited all the new adventures she gets into
I’m so happy for you!! ❤️
This is such a cute video!
i’m so excited omg
Omg congrats 😂 🤩!
i actually bought two things of the glamnetic nails, the boba and aroura. those are a great combo if you were wondering, which you probably weren't but its fine.
It’s so perfect!
Congrats! There is nothing more exciting than your own home. Enjoy, girl!
You deserve it !!!! Keep on being you girlfriend!!!!
oooooh
That advice about living with your parents was really good ^^

She bought the house so she could store her Ariana Grande dress
I'm so happy for you!!! Really wish you the best. I feel like you have a good heart and you deserve good things. Are you bringing your chickens? 💖
I knew something like this would happen
This. This video is my favorite.
I usually click away when people try to sell me things but that was great❤️🎀❤️
I'm so excited for you!!! I can't wait to see how you make it your own!!♡♡♡♡
I live in Iraq 🇮🇶😂💙

IM NO CREEP :/

aaaaa I'm so happy for your new achievement, good luck!
YOU DID
Aaand she's bought a house...(-_ど)
I love how happy you are!!! Congrats!!
this make me so happy!
Ok, but the fact that your sweater matches the pillows and curtains is a queen move. 😂
I'm so happy for you, congratulations!!!
Wow it's beautiful ! You're so lucky... you've always seemed lovely!
The ad was so good I actually watched it instead of skipping it lmao

That's why I thought something was... E h
YAAAA HOUSE!!!! LETS GOOOOO
Omg shes so pretty like the house and On my way! I have no words ily micarah
Luv your editing 🙃
Awwwwwwww this was so precious to watch you deserve it!
Just a thought, make sure the house is cleansed! I'm not sure if you totally believe in this but moving into a house can awaken negative spirits that could cause a lot of trouble. I suggest talking to your priest about it just in case!!
Congratulations!  Enjoy!
that titanic scene remake was emotional
This was way too adorable. I'm glad you love it, it's gorgeous!!!
you do deserve it and congratulations!
Tell me why I said her name and not even a second later she posted this! Are you listening to me? Are you my FBI agent?
She so happyyyyy ☺️🤗
I've been waiting for this one, TURN IT UP!
i gasped.
✨Gold✨
Oh sweetie! You totally deserve this house! You've brought me so much joy that I can't express and I'm super grateful. Keep up the good work!

Half way through I got a tiktok ad for buckling up before driving and I didn't realize it wasn't apart of the video until the next ad played.
I am genuinely happy for you. Seeing other people do life changing wise, makes me happy and gives me hope. I cried a tear.

This house fits you really good (even tho I don’t know you)
No no no please you 100% deserve it you have the purest and funniest soul and the best sense of humour 😂❤️
"I love you house, you make me happy"

Congratulations on your new house 🎉🏠🙌 and you do deserve it. Your so talented and funny 👌

CONGRATS!
Micarah is the only person I willingly watch and enjoy the ads
I was the 15,500 person to see this video lol
HAHA YUS good job :3
So happy for you!!
RV women youtuber is no longer an RV women Now introducing *house women youtuber*
Now i feel silly cause i had no idea what you said in the previous video...
Very happy for you! You def deserve it, you've worked so hard on your videos! Also incredibly sorry you've had creepy people bother you. That's a huge invasion of privacy and super terrifying. Wishing you and Garrion the best <3
Micarah blink twice if someones stalking you 👁👄👁
I'm so glad we could help you fulfill your dreams! You totally deserve it!
This is amazing
Congratulations 🥳
So now it’s possible to meet you :)
That Titanic scene should have been in the original script... On that note, why isn't Micarah writing for movies??
Can’t wait to see how you have a sewing room... I said this more than a year ago. Now it’s come to fruition!!! Sooo darn awesome
Can’t wait for it to become a hoarder’s den
IVE NEVER BEEN THIS EARLY IN MY WHOLE LIFE
Guys I think Micarah bought a house
Me: reads the title Also me:.... I KNEW IT!!!
K I’m genuinely concerned that you have a stocker. Girl just give us basic info and we will find them and destroy them. 🥰
THE WAY IM SMILING
i- why is the egg thing so relatable *gets war flashbacks *
I got the notification and got really excited, and then got really excited when I saw the word " I BOUGHT.…...." EVERY SINGLE TIME
I’m glad you’re able to do this. It’s heartening to see people around my age having their dreams come true
Garrién just flies to her?? That’s beautiful 🥺🥺
Great job on reenacting the titanic. I couldn’t even see a difference between the real one and the one you made
She talks so casually about her putting a wig on roadkill and a cop stopping to talk to her about it. And how she managed to convince him that seeing it would brighten peoples day??? I’m happy I know this story
Omg congrats girll
1. It still amazes me that we're allowed to have an amazing human like Micarah on this planet B. Her explanation of real estate agents is so spot on that it's sad. We sold our house and bought a house without one.. 10/10
THAT HOUSE IS SO PRETTY MICARAH
Congrats 💜💜💜
HIIIII EE IM SO EARLYYY IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU!!!
I actually prefer micarah over spaghetti.
Do you have a name for your house??
Yet you still put your shoes on the couch...
I thought the cut off about the house was a joke.
Oh my gioissshhhhhh
YESS IM SO PROUD OF YOU MICARAH HECK YEAH
This is the Best. Finacial Advice. Ever. Buy what you need when you can.
Liked the video before watching it cause it's michara and her videos even though they used to be filmed on potato, they never sucked
Omg!!!
I love this woman. I have tripped over and fallen for her
i cant wait to see how you decorate it
shes alive.
I remember when I subscribed when you made an entire wardrobe for your cruise vacation and now you bought a house we love growth here <3
AGGGHHHHHH
Congratulations!! Love you🔥🍒❤️🎀❤️🍒🔥
well happy woman's day 😊👩🏻👩👩🏼👩🏽👩🏾👩🏿
How am i so early. anyways I LOVE YOU IM YOUR BIGGEST FAN ILL ALWAYS BE YOUR BIGGEST FAN!!!
guys i think she's excited about her house
I love your videos, they make me feel happy 🌚💓  Congratulations on your new home 💅🗿💞      I hope there are no ghosts in your house 😂😂😂😂😂👍
Your reaction about getting a house is literally me when I passed my driving license last week!
i was going to study but... i can wait another 14 minutes
Yummy house
I'm so happy for youuuu🥰😝
I DRINK CAKE.
Sooooo incredibly proud of you!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️ Alsooooo, why did my dad use to offer me eggs ALL THE TIME too????
Like I kinda prefer you over spaghetti
happy for uu
This girl is so FLIP FLOPPING precious! Love her 😘😊
Aww I’m soo glad ur happy 😊
wait we have the same sofa but mine is grey and one is dark green
When I tell you I LEAPED onto my bed when I got the notification.
I just got so excited for you boo!
I expect that if there is enough room Gereon will have his own room
I'm so proud of you!!
When my queen stops I stop everything. What I mean Is I watch her video
Youtubers should learn how to do an ad from her damn 😂
She moved for Gereon, which is the best of reasons.
"But so is your fear of clowns" Alright I'm in this video and I don't like it lol
Ahh!! I cant wait to watch all your new house related videos!
*Micarah posts new video* Me: clicking without even reading a title
i knew it was hers.. congratulations! 🎉❤️
CONGRATS ON THE HOUSE! You 100% deserve it :)
Eyy now you can bring more bird friends home : D
Congratulations!!!
Micarah: i won't show the front of my house Micarah on the thumbnail: 👁👄👁
Aw those people who stalk you aren't true fans. No one who really loved you would invade your privacy ❤️
Congratulations!! WooooopooooooowwWw!!   Don’t read further if you don’t want to get bummed out...  sorry about the creeps out here ☹️
Heloooooooooooo
I always get so excited when one of her videos comes in my notifications
You've never been to two bathrooms at the same time?! Guuurrlll, you're missing out.
I love living vicariously through a youtuber
I’m planning on buying one, too, this year!
ok so micarah is just liking people's comments so i thought i'd just try my shot lmao
Glamnetics is probably like "wtf did we sign-up for?" lmaoo
Me seeing she bought a house.        👌👌👌👌
BUY A DONKEY 😩
Omg i clicked so fast cause its michara
THIS. AD. IS. EVERYTHING.
hiii
"If I ever needed an evening gown for anything I'd spend less than $13 making it." 😂😂😂
Lmao that semicolon joke 😂 I am DECEASED. Ha we got another joke-I mean one liner. It is a good day. Edit: Also Micarah, are you ok? Did..someone actually do that to you? Stalkers are terrifying I'm so sorry if so 💔
You are so awesome.   also your house is so beautiful! I know you will make it into your dream home more so than it is right now! You deserve everything blessing you've got!!! Ly<3
reading the title, "HOLY SHEESH SHE GOT A HOUSE YOU GO GIRL!!!!!"
Early gang
got an ad for adult diapers on this video, thought i should share.
micarah please make a cameo . i will pay any money for any video as good as your ad spots
Yee yee
who would have thought that I needed magnetic eyelashes all along
Ahhhhhhhh ! Im so happy for you!! And jealous too... But im happy for you!
"I bought a House!" Me: Okay, what did you do Micarah-
Congrats Micarah!! Been here since day 1 with the chicken feed dress video
Yes!!!!!! I’ll just be here waiting for all the renovation videos. Even though it doesn’t actually look like it needs any!
I KNEW SHE WAS GONNA BUY A HOUSE!!!!!!! :) :)
I hope you plan on painting the exterior pink #barbiesdreamhouse
Thank you for being my favorite Youtuber and just one of my favorite people. You make me proud to be a homeschooler. (Well I mean I already was, but you make me even more so.)
house!? extra storage for micarah!? yes!!
I might've watched too much of The Umbrella Academy but you look a lot like Elliot Page
That Titanic reenactment was just beautiful.
IM SO HAPPY FOR U OMG
Yayyyyyy!!!!!! It’s sooooo cute I can’t wait to see what you do to it!!! Yes you do deserve it I can’t wait to be like you when I’m older!!
I drink cake too. I love your vids!
lol i love the whole "putting costumes on roadkill"  wow most people have committed like underage drinking  or shoplifting (idk im wierd)
Wooooow👏👏👏👏👏
Hello love your vids
thank you for the videos i couldn´t stand watching the same episodes of say yes to the dress
When I read the title “I BOUGHT A HOUSE” I was so happy for you! May good luck on your house!
AAH CONGRATS!! :D
Hii
The only paid promotion I have ever seen without skipping forward lol
i've been waiting for your videos (((-:
We didn’t need you to come through like this, every video is le *chefs kiss*  😘😍
I also have a fear of having debts, and for me, it lingers despite I know I can pay it late cuz my brain gonna be be like "mmmmm what if you need to buy something big for emergency and u can't pay for this item as a result?"     The fear doesn't stop my hoarding habits doe-
I would wear nails if they were magnetic
Hi Micarah! Love your channel, got any tips on how to make videos? Specifically sewing videos☺️ I want to start making sewing tutorials inspired by you so I would appreciate if you answers😊 (I don’t have a good filming camera, I just have my phone and my iPad to film on)
AAAAAY
Micarah's ads are literally the only ones I never skip.
VICTORIAN BARBIE HOUSE!!!!!!!
As a dude, I don't think I've ever been nearly as convinced to buy fake lashes.
I was not expecting this
E G G S
I can't believe I saw a 5 MIN LONG ADVERTISEMENT WITHOUT WANTING THE SKIP ADD BUTTON. 😱😱
I'm gonna miss your dad..... congratulations on your house 🏠
This day just got better 🍀
Are we just going to ignore that she dressed up roadkill 💀
i'm so happy for you!
Barely started this video, but CONGRATULATIONS ON THE NEW HOUSE Finally more floor space for bigger measurements like cows or lakes
I thought the title said I bought a mouse and I was like “wHy iS sHe HoLdInG kEyS and then my pea sized brain reread it-
I saw this and snorted. Don't ask why that was an appropriate reaction. CONGRATULATIONNNMNNNNNNNNNÑ
Not going to lie, I expected a house on wheels, those houses you can move😂
Turn up the playback speed and you can’t hear what she’s saying anymore
We all better be watching all the commercials now she bought a house 🏠🙂😄❤❤
I'm soo happy for you 😃 😃 😃
🥇
my ears bleeding are worth it i love you
omg you are so adorable! we all know how hard you work and you totally deserve to buy such a lovely house ❤️
Um.. So...... You DId Dis 4 Watt!! I have been asking my self about your last video.... okay!
Omg I’m early
ну наконец-то. лол как возможно комфортно жить в трейлере? рада за тебя.          черт, никто ведь не знает тут русского.
Micarah is gonna decorate her house so well I’m literally so pumped ahhh :>
Congrats dude!
Slight piracy? No I prefer full piracy. Who wouldn’t want to go full out pirate?
Result? Now she has 3 houses.
I'd probably watch a whole season of you and that hand. Was her name Handilla?
How tall are those walls O_O
I got an ad for eggs on this video ??????
I absolutely agree with living with family for as long as possible, unless family is toxic
this icon got a sponsor for her HOUSE queen behavior
What the heck did we do to deserve such a wholesome human being
Gosh I missed you💯💓❤️😂
I came from Instagram as fast as I could
How did you settle on Ohio?
Micarah I’m so so sorry about what’s going on at 5:44, that breaks my heart :(( I hope you and your dad are both as safe as possible.
International women's day? I'm wondering what amazing thing my favorite woman is doing.♀️🏋️‍♀️❤️ Was pleasantly surprised 🙀
Your outfit in this video *chefs kiss* Actually, excuse me, outfitS
Hi I missed you! 😊
: D
STOP IT!!!!!!
Congratssss bb
“It’s the Instagram of responsible adults.”😂😂
new life goals being born in me  today... buying lashes uhmm a house
First comment            I think
does the queen reply? :)
The look on my face when you described the built-in bar
go you!!! ❤️❤️
Yesssss giving you virtual hugs 🥺☺️
7 m
I feel so happy for you, you truly deserve it. Wishing you nothing but good things from now on 💛
Micarah: I bought a house! RV: Am I a joke to you? Congratulations!!!
Congratulations I can't believe it you bought a house House do you still have any of these?
I am soooooo excited for you!!! Congrats!!!!
Why did i read the title as "I bought a homie"
I noticed your nails before you mentioned them - so pretty! And a huge congrats on becoming a home owner. You go girl!!!
I literally was just thinking that I needed a new video from you. It’s like you just always know... hmmmmm 🤔
I’m so excited for you!!! I haven’t even finished but I’m so happy for you! Now you’ve got a huge rub to decorate that you also can not drive. But also more room for a fabric hoard!!
I literally love your vids been watching for 2 years
I don't know if you'll ever see this, but I just wanted to say that I love your videos and you truly inspire me to be better and more creative. I love that you have such a great relationship with your family and friends, and you just genuinely inspire me to be a better person. Best of luck!
Glad to see I wasn't the only one who thought the title was "I bought a horse" and was completely unfazed because that seems exactly like something Micarah would do.
Next vid idea : putting my rv up for adoption   Obvi you wont do that AND DONT. Put your rv up for adoption❤️✨
Literally got here at 1 second
SO HAPPY FOR YOUUU
I have never clicked on a video faster-
MY HEART WENT 📈📉📈📉📈📉📈📉📈📉📈📈
YAY
Yay you got more room! More room for things!
What if the title said 'I bought a horse'! I wouldn't be surprised
im so poud of youuu 👩‍❤️‍💋‍👩
Congrats!
I called it!
Hi Micarah
This is an addiction at this point
Bruh now you own a house
Why is it so hard to be depressed while I watch these?
When you honestly didn’t think she bought a house and instead broke into a broken down house because you feel like that’s something she would do ✌️
Congratulations 🍾🎉
She's getting a house, and I'm wondering if I can afford vegetables this week LOL I can't wait to see the renovations
Moral of the story: dump jack and date lashes lmao
I already loved your channel but after you referenced Titanic i was like: aaaaa(Titanic forever!!!)
yessss im so happy for u!!!! 💕💕🥰
What’s the houses name?!?!?!?!
What are dippin eggs? -.-
Would love to see an actual reenactment of a Victorian tea party😀
Now you have 3 houses!
i don't even mind that she posts infrequently because its always good and entertaining content :)
👑QuEeN
MICARAH, MA’AM, HOW ICONIC
where are those white boots from?? i loveeeeeeeeeeeee
"it dawned on me" Top comedy
YES! Congrats, Micarah!!!
You are so pretty. Both from in and out. Love yourself
LOVE FROM MÉXICO ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I have nothing funny to say so here is a: Last time I was this early I wasn't even subscribed to you.
The ads you do are the only ones I don't skip.
I KNEW IT
Haha
Gonna watch a 2 minute add to try and support:)
I have the feeling that this is my first time commenting on a video of micarah but anyway, love the video
UGH I’m sorry you have creepy men invading your privacy. They are everywhere I tell ya!!!
Ahhhhh I'm so happy for you!
I love the commercial😂😂
I was doing my homework and started to get bored and this masterpiece appeared
the neighbors are gonna be so confused when they realize that a disney princess and her animal sidekick live next door
A no-debt queen! YES!!!
There is something about your voice  .................your voice overs sounds like cursive handwriting
I love these glamnetic ads,  I could watch them on repeat , please make this a regular thing ! ( just kidding...you dont have to do that EVERY video)
I am so excited for this video!!
the blood was worth it
Congrats babyyyyy❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️Hope you wake up and feel proud. Rooting for you.
YYYAAAYYY!!!! So happy for you!!!😆😁😁
Micarah - ** draws a face on her hand and recreates the titanic**  Me - “so I’m not the only one...”
Yayyayay I was waiting for her viddddd ayayyaya
I thought something was up.. SO SORRY 😫😫
me: school... Michara's video... yea I'll do the latter
To whoever finds this deep within the sea of comments...              𝐻𝑒𝑙𝑙𝑜
micarah can i be your friend? you don’t have to like me
bloop
One of these day, Micarah is going to be hired as a spokesperson for something. Doesn’t even matter what it’ll be. I don’t even think she’ll care for what it’ll be. As long as people remember her for it.
SAW THIS FROM INSTAGRAM
Uhggg, omg but liek can I have your rv 🥺😝😂🙌🏻
1:28 thank me later
2.3k vs 1 thumb down
Wow  it about time  space for her works😃😀
I like your creative way of advertising
Ahhhh I love you soooo much! Congratulations on your new house!!
I loved that the reason she chose the code TEWERS was because it was quick to type out🙌
I had to look down at my keyboard to check that the letters for "Tewers" were indeed right next to each other
Hard work pays off.  You didi well.  congrats! Now me! 😈
I Love her vids big hello from Germany
AHHHH CAN I PLEASE BE INVITED TO THE TEA PARTYYYYYYY
Congrats! Also, I love that outfit with the red top
Okey, I lost it in the Titanic part, like how are you so creative??? Love from Spain ♥️ Pd:You once said that Jesus made something incredible for you and I would love to hear your story. 😘
Congratulations so happy for you
i screamed when i saw the title miCARAH DON'T DO THIS TO ME
[puts on my glamnetic lashes] mining time
Congrats you deserve it :)
*Insert Thor Meme* I KNEW IT!
That one dislike is probably the original owner of the house lol
Okay but you need to get a bidet if you don't have one Micarah... genuinely life changing. Also better for the planet.
Congratulations 🎉🎉!!
Heyy 💞 💕
actually laughed at the dawn joke omgg
Thanks for spoiling the end of Titanic for me
Next year you should buy America
Aww I love that house
glamnetic: even waterproof mascara
“I’m gonna have to let go, Jack. But these lashes... never will.” 😂
hi you are one of my favorite youtubers
here after 5 min but idk what to type
I love they way you do your adds. I wish other YouTubers did it the same way. It's an add that makes you happy to watch it.
I was like "finally gurl it was timee"
never been so early in my life
I don't question u now
You are pretty , hilarious, and talented. You check every box.
I'm soooo early not really
"I'm very particular about which laws I break"
I've started to reduce my phone's brightness at night.
Oh no! The eyeliner/lashes reenactment of the Titanic was so sad!! 😂
You brought a horse?     Where?    Oh.
OMG 😱 😍 congratulations to u and ur bird
who else was expecting it to be a house made of rvs.. no just me.. okay
I was wondering when this would happen!
_still convinced Micarah just broke in and no one questioned it_
“This has been a joke”    -Micarah Tewers
we been knew  Congrats girlll
I knew it!!!! shes just been waiting to tell us
Just say it you bought a new house to get more space because 2 RVs were not enough.
Greetings from Germany
WWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Omg congrats!
Talks about the eyelashes....  All of a sudden...  speaks faster than how dealerships speak when they say all the disadvantages to them having a 50% off on all these terrible cars
Me too!!!! Congratulations 🎊🎉🎈🍾
Literally 99℅ won't see this but God bless you and be safe during these times I'm struggling to hit 5k ....
oh I can’t wait !
"I know I don't deserve this" queen what are you on about? You are such an amazing human being and I feel so so happy for you!! We're proud of you Micarah, and you do so deserve this. Can't wait to see all the videos from your new home!
Micarah and her ever expanding residences 📈 We love to see it

The matching curtain, pillow and shirt *chefs kiss*
Congrats!
Hahaha
I saw micarah and clicked. Have a nice day
Micarah: I bought a house My eyes: I bought another RV My mind:hmmmm
Congratulations!!
You're so funny 🙃🤣
Am I the only one seeing the orb leaving her body at 4:55? Just me? 🤔
I thought she said “moron crime” cuz yes some of these laws are moronic
I saw the video and immediately audibly said, "you wot mate"
SO HAPPY!! CONGRATULATIONS QUEEN!!❤❤
The way Rose sat on one corner of the door bahahah
Last time I was this early Micarah Tewers hadn't bought a house.
👏👏👏
MICARAH MY CAT WITH A WEIRD MUSTACHE IS SUCH A BIG FAN OF YOURS
WHATTT
OMG QUEEN CONGRATS!!💖💖💖
Yay!!!!!!! Congratulations!!!!! 🎊🎊🎊🎉🎉🎉🎉
I can already see the home renovation videos 😏
Can we just talk about how gorgeous she is?
Micarah : two RV's and a house  Me : 1 room

Congrats Micarah!
Saw the title and had an immediate "aww!" Congrats on your new adventure with your new home 🖤🥰
OMGGGG  All I can see is it’s pink- love it already!

She has a home on wheels, a home on land...now she just needs a houseboat
I KNEW IT
EVERY TIME I SEE ADDS IN YOUR VIDEO I GET SO EXCITED BC YOUR GETTING MONEYYYYY 💴
I was sewing... thinking: “guess we’ll have a house tour soon” magic! Happy for you
I thought that I was early since she posted just 3 min ago but here we are with almost 700 comments
She’s done it guys. She’s escaped the *christmas* *tree*
Barbie has millions of jobs  Micarah has millions of living places  Thay are practically twins  Nickname the plastics
hi, what's your opinion on socks?
Knowing her she's probably gonna rip the house from the foundation and put it on top of her two RVs. And drive around the USA looking for all the thrift stores, upon her mobile castle
HOUSE TOUR!!!
From the title I just want to say congratulations!!!
Watching this instead of listening to my English class
i was half asleep but i came here as fast as i can. what else did you do now?
I love how you made buying a house into an ad about lashes 😭
IM SO PROUD OF YOU MICARAH.
i really like how you explain things ironically in a way no one else would
I have the same tweezers
The growth of this channel is ASTRONOMICAL
Your stories told me to come watch the video :') congrats!
Wow, I left my game just for this
I’m so glad you’ve posted again. I was watching like aaaallll your videos while hand sewing. I find you very inspirational.
Wait your dad ISN’T called Jerry???????
I knew it! CONGRATULATIONS!!!
So do you now own a house and two rvs?
Yeeeeees I was so excited when I read this!! You deserve this so much and the house just screams Micarah. Cannot wait to see what you do with it!
I’m gonna miss the RV🥺 but happy you got a house😃😄
CONGRATS BY THE WAY!!
Yeah
EARLY FOR HER HIGHNESS > THE QUEEN
honestly anything u make a video about is entertaining
Finally!
MICARAH OMG YOU HAVE A HOUSE!!! SO MUCH ROOM FOR SEWING!!!!! idk why I am so excited for u lol
What happened to the RVs it must feel sad and lonely  And also I thought that if she got a house and posted about it then it will be a DIY video
Can we just appreciate how good the outfits in this video are ?
Way to go!! Micarah!!! Im So happy for you!!!!
I knew it! Heheh can wait for all the videos
Its the first time that I’m early, but wow! Girl what are you gonna do with your rvs now?!
aaah so happy and proud of you!! now you're a homeowner lady with two RV's how cool is that!
Petition to have micarah start a podcast bc her voice is litterly PERFECT.

YESSSSS GOOD FOR YOU
good morning
this is the video that finally made me realise what a semi colon does so thanks
This is so nice omg
I honestly want a bidet. Cause... periods. And disposable wet wipes aren’t a good solution. I often end up showering the bottom half of my body after school, but I could just use a bidet instead! Wow I need one haha
