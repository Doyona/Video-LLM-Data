Excellent video, just cut the voice bars during the clips, too much going on the screen then.
Can you make the background music quieter
1:44 shows JJ just fixated on the same kind of shot that knocked out our 6ers in 2019
KLAY! Very inspiring, imma need to get a boat or floating house with oyster reefs
bro they superdeep gp2
Whats crazy is that he didnt even mention Andrew Wiggins who has gone from perennial disappointment in Min to all-star caliber on GS. He will be the biggest X-factor on this team come playoff time
Kendrick Perkins: screams at myplayer in nba 2k22 for having YouTube channel. JJ Redick:
And we aren’t even talking about Wiggins playing the best ball of his career
BUCKETS!!
He competes....
The Warriors need to readjust to playing with Klay again. He’s as good a shooter as Steph and needs to be treated as such. They’ve played without him for so long, Steph can relax a lot more now and I can see they’re not adjusting to that yet.
The highlight package and graphics in addition to the commentary is elite.  Love the attention to detail.
,he stole the snarl by my boy TYLER HERRO,tsktsk😅🤣
He is playing more iso and dribble focused games which is not gsw basketball. Also his form seems way different from before the injury, don't know if he is still gonna make those small window 3 daggers in clutch with new one legged shots. Otherwise he seems healthy love to see him on the court
Do you know who is soon going to be irrelevant soon at GSW? Andrew Wiggins. Myers need to go after Ben Simmons now or this team is riding on false hope.
I really think this Warriors team is done getting hurt for a few years. They've all had their bouts with health, one way or another. I think they've got some years left to win a few chips. They can do it, too. As long as their core stays intact and they're surrounded by role players doing what they're supposed to, they have a shot to win it all each year.
Howto make franky
Everyone ripped Kristaps when he did this exact thing, but Klay gets praised😂💀 alright, I see how it is🥱
The BASE at the Beginning of the video! My ears were reminded of my youth!
I will say, his fade away looks GREAT.
https://youtu.be/1SOc9yHEmjQ
Should've simply said "Go Hubie but I started it..."
I hope it happens as it should. He and the team deserve it. 2022 🏆 🏆 🏆 🏆
Klay not in top 75…
It scares me when he dunks xD

Everything fits except for Chioza! Hopefully he gets traded for someone more experienced or athletic
Guy scored 17 in 20mins!! Thats insane! esp after almost 900 days off from the game!
Most of websites’ online stores are out of gears… 11 …mmm
Klay already had his sea legs 😉
Who else literally feels like YouTube is their best friend during Covid ? 👒👑🍓👒👑
I'm so glad you do these videos JJ!!
January 9th unofficially Klay Day going forward
Can't wait for grizzilies vs Warriors tomorrow. That game is gonna be amazing
None of those shots were his shots. It was weird watching his highlights.
Now that he’s back, where will Wiggins be traded? 😂
Klay is my favorite player. Can't even describe how happy I was seeing him play again after 2.5 years.
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life. told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and liberates and gives eternal life535
I would be ok w the warriors winning 1 w/o KD ~ from SA & a spurs fun. Klays great
Scared 😱 no but nervous yes. And it’s game time. I give Klay till after the Allstar game to be really dominant. Steph won’t be on a shooting slump Drey will be back OMG…. Conference Finals…… Warriors and Suns 🤷🏾‍♂️
Klay was the best defender in the league before his injuries. I hope he gets back to that level soon.

yooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
do more of these and sell them to ESPN. you don't need to be debating those clowns, lol
JJ you sound like a broken record value value value value. Your professional broadcaster start talking like one.
Great breakdown JJ. Honestly.
The warriors biggest flaw is the amount of turnovers they commit. A lot of careless turnovers but they play such good defense it helps cover up lost possessions
When the Warriors were destroying teams in 3 quarters, Klay didn’t need to expend the huge amount of energy necessary to play d. When called upon to play all star defense Klay was fantastic.
You’re still an athlete JJ, just an ex pro… and a good one at that.
shut up JJ,your among those Who says Khlay can't be himself after two surgery, You said Warriors haven't played bigger teams so they can't be rated even though theyve been winning, the funny thing JJ You rated Lebron Who happens to be lossing, JJ hates Warriors
KLAY, DRAY, and STEPH IS DEADLY,, NBA SHLD WATCH OUT
Not making the 75 (complete joke if you ask me) has gotta be some great motivation when you know how good you are. Klay's gonna make a lot of people remember how much of a problem he can really be in the league.
Your take on the Warriors at the end of the video is the best I have heard.  You were spot on. Just subscribed bro. Thanks for your thoughts.
Iggy will also be a hall of famer
What’s scary is wisemen still hasn’t came back and devoloped yet
Scary times
Thanks for this, but it's weird not to see you talking (one of the nicest things about seeing the person talking is that makes the communication more human).
Klay is just a baller. Point blank.
Klay I wasn't happy with my plus 2 ? Most people would be happy with +2
Kay Thompson the greatest #2 ever. Over Pippen and over Wade.
Great breakdown! I feel great knowing I view the game the same way.
I need u to do a breakdown like this of Alex Caruso this season
He didn’t get his feelings hurt.
He got a slam down dunk between two defenders crossing arms , and then got a block
Bjelica hasn't really been good at all
Shocking, the answer to these injuries is rest. Kawhi KD Klay wouldn’t come back the same back then.
As a Warriors fan, Im pretty new to JJ Redick but I really like this guys commentary...smart dude.  Made me go back and watch him as a player just because I was curious.
Jj would know , he has to guard klay .
I’m more impressed with 18 jacks in 19 minutes. - JJ reddick 2022
Klay looked good last night but he did look really slow. With how the warriors play now they play so much faster compared to 2 years ago. With green coming back they be playing even faster pace. That's what I'm worried about is at the speed they play at will he be able to keep up. I think he is far away from fitting in with team at this point.
I thought the grizzlies were the best defensive team in the league.
JJ a closet Racist on the Low......
This is a basketball nerd's wet dream
I'm calling it now Warriors vs Nets in the Finals this year.💯
I jumped out of my damn chair when he dunked on the Cav’s big man.
Steph, Klay and Draymond about to have the same amount of Championship Rings as Lebron James. And will have a better record head to head vs. Lebron in the Finals.
Bet LBJ coming up with trade packages right now to send himself to Golden State! 🤣
JJ describing Klay's Defense (as well as DefensiveRPM) makes me hate statistics even more.. Especially Knowing Klay has only 1 All Defensive SECOND Team selection
JJ has been putting out great content. I will listen to JJ podcast over Steven A. every time. After a while you realize that S.A. Is just loud noise, bug words, and no substance.
JJ is an elite level analyst. No hype. No hyperbole. Just practical and accurate insights communicated clearly
Thanks for covering this. All the media today kept talking about the Lakers losing, instead of the biggest story in the NBA of Klay not playing for almost 3 years and coming back and looking good. It’s like they wanted to avoid talking about it smh
If KLAY n Steph win ANYMORE rings - both of them become better than KD... PROVES KD NEED THEM
Please do more of these! This was a great video
Lakers and Nets are teams of NAMES.   Warriors, Suns, Bucs are teams built around a single NAME.   that’s why they’re better.
JJ you are still an athlete. One of the best to do it in the world. Appreciate you.
JJ is the best analyst in sports! I love the way he communicates, the logic he applies to his thinking and the facts to support his positions.
JJ ...I didn't like u because u were a CLIPPER BUT I ALWAYS RESPECTED YOUR ABILITYS ...I HOPE U CAN GET ON A TEAM AND I LUV YOUR CHANNEL ..KEEP IT PIMPN JJ LOVE FROM EAST OAKLAND #KLAYAREA #SPLASHTOWN #MACKLAY #KLAYDAY
Make JJ Reddick a gametime espn commentator
Basketball is back to normal with Klay back! The game has missed him greatly!
people keep saying he may not go back to what he was as a defender but even if he doesnt, they dont need him to guard the best ball handler/wing like they needed him to do in the past, they have wiggins for that now, klay doesnt need to be prime defensively for them to succeed
The league is in fuckn trouble
His green light is always on! Lol love that fire that burns in him. He mad he got snuffed from the 75th anniversary team too
I love that we have JJ to breakdown basketball for us now. #Blessed
Klay coming for revenge on what idk  but be afraid NBA be very very afraid.
Jj I haven’t seen you on First Take lately. SAS got tired of you making him look foolish?
I am not a SUPER fan, but enough of a casual to understand this was a HUGE moment for Klay, the Warriors and all of basketball really. To me this just further extended Golden State as the favorite to win it all this year. Combine this with Steph breaking the shooting record and it makes for a great season story. Good luck to Klay
JJ is the best analyst online.
I don’t know how klay hasn’t made a all defensive team cause he’s guarding all the pg Steph is supposed to guard
He believes his body that is capable of doing moves he wants to do in his mind.  His dunk was the metrics that he knows he is able to do it…. I was shocked and freaked out at the same time… please take it easy Klay! 😄
I liked the comment on the use of the term "scared". It's a silly term. Of course no player would be scared. If they lose, they lose. They will be sad, not scared. I think a lot of fans from others teams are kind of sad. So the term that should be used is different.  I'm saying all of this as a massive Dubs fan. So, teams are scared of the Dubs? Hell, no. But these teams might feel sad after losing to this Debs? For sure. Fans of other teams are sad? If they're not sad now, they might be later.
The snarl was lame
The Draymond thing was lame
JJ reddick might be the most fairest and one of the best analyst in the NBA media
Somehow everybody likes the guy. Myself included. I'm not a GSW fan. Yet I rooted for this guy to be able to make a meaningful comeback. The only other player who I had the same feelings for was D Rose and his injuries.
Hot take but I think Klay might be better than Steph
i had to hold my breath for a second when he was running down court chasing the defender and stumbled when he hit the back of the player’s foot. that was his right foot too 🙏🏽
This could be their best team ever.
Nah man. Thompson and Curry are overrated.
Take a 10 day JJ . Listening to u is very difficult
I enjoy this JJ only episode. Kinda refreshing to just have a long, uninterrupted take.
Hi JJ!! this gotta be my fav sports podcast from one of my fav players ever. love your analysis bc of the depth you dive into different aspects of the game that a lot of ppl don’t have the ability to. keep up the awesome work!
We were all scared when he went for that dunk but tbh I’m glad he did it. Imagine thinking about your every step while playing.. that mental block woulda messed up his game 💯
Then wiseman comes back beastin
That dunk should have everyone in the league in complete fear
What I haven't heard anyone say about that dunk is that it's VERY close to the situation that got him hurt originally with the raptors. If anything, that was the moment I knew this guy had healed from the injury emotionally. There was no hesitation or trauma. He just did it.
Was a tiny bit worried about his defense, seems to be rusty, but some lateral movement might be permanently gone - however, he was by no means a negative on that end
Do they need a big centre though for the playoffs or no? Especially on defense? Looney is only about 6'9 and we don't know what Wiseman is going to be like.
JJ pod up there with All the smoke. Keep going !
Love the aggression...the mean mug on the dunk??? Who is this klay Thompson??? We love it in the bay. Jj is right..some people nervous with those legs after injury. He trusts his legs. He's back. #Dubnation #webelieve
Klay side mouvement in defence was really really impressive after 2 injury and 2 years out. 🤯🤯
I think I speak for everyone when I say we need more of these breakdowns. Great stuff
That dunk was all I needed to see, his confidence is 100  which is the most important thing after being out with a severe injury
Shoutout to JJs content team, need more of these! Easy content to produce and pump out for you guys. Let’s maybe put the audio bar on the top right or something? Instead of overlaying on the whole video, just a suggestion but love it!
Can’t wait for Grizzlies vs Warriors tomorrow. That game is gonna be amazing
I feel like Klays shooting form has changed a lot. (I feel like that happens after a long time leg injury) but it just looks like his guide hand flares out to the basket a little more kinda like kyries now and before it was as straight as ever. I mean who cares right the man is still a bucket 😂😂
If that last 3 he shot went in, I would've won £1500.   Honestly thought he'd get to 20pts, & had him getting 20 + 3 3s made.   Annoying af.
JJ, I like listening to your analysis. Being a former player who also understands the game well, plus can form an unbiased opinion.
They will get Wiseman at some point.  Sheeesh, that squad is going to sweep through the West.
The way JJ talks is so articulate and enjoyable to listen to :) we do all love Klay btw he seems like a great gent
He looks better than he did b4 the injuries
941 days. To finally be out on the court with  competitive basketball juice flowing through the veins... Feeling and hearing the fans... Throw down on defenders head... Had to have felt so Damn Good. 😤
Some of my favorite players are the chill guys like d rose, kawhi, klay... glad to see klay back
jj goated
Former athlete .. I feel for the local rec league players when you show up !
this podcast is just amazing, super cool to watch the game being broken down by a former nba player.
Amazing content, you will have an awesome career in basketball analysis, broadcasting, whatever. Hope you stick to this style, really bringing in a player’s perspective from your time in the NBA. Loved the insight that no NBA player is scared of the Warriors, but the Warriors are scary due too…Subscribed and looking forward to more content.
Snarling Klay!   Watch out.
SO HAPPY TO HAVE KLAY BACK MAN!!!! Missed him so much, and yes, everyone on this team understands their roles well, esp. the big three. NO EGOS or DRAMA and that's why they're the best team ever
Read the title of this video back to yourself. Grammar is your friend.
What's craziest thing to me is that Klay only have one NBA All-Defensive Team in his career. He's been an elite defender since 2014-2015 maybe even in 2013
This y I like jj never like him when he played lol   But respected him
There is a mistake, Iggy will be in Hof too maybe not first ballot but he will be voted
I’m just so happy to have him back. Not even as a fan of any team, for the sport.
I hope it happens as it should. He and the team deserve it. 2022 🏆 🏆 🏆 🏆
I love the fact that he's a true 2-way player....plays tough hard nosed defense....plays off the ball on offense....total complete player
I'm not the biggest Warriors fan, or much of a Klay fan for that matter, but last night felt special. The NBA is a better place with Klay playing.
“as an athlete myself”   JJ still wants to compete…and I’m here for it
If a rusty as hell Klay can still play 15 minutes and hit 3 or 4 threes, the NBA better be on high alert.
Klay is special
Thanks for this JJ your the first to bring it up this morning
Its crazy how you can just post anything you want on this chanel
Has Klay ever made an All Defensive Team?
I can see why Fans still voted him in the all star game, Media might've forgotten who Klay is but trh Fans haven't
This podcast is absolutely amazing,I can't believe how awesome this podcast is. I've been a fan of your game since your days at Orlando. I always thought that you were one the most under appreciated marksman in the league. Again great podcast
Ly JJ, you talk about the game I’m such an honest way

JJ is the best basketball analysis out there right now
Klay’s confidence is second to none. He was out for so long and comes back with with the fire like he never left 🔥
"scary" started in boxing, only works in combat sports
Kai return was fun!
Look at Klay man, so inspirational
Warriors winning the chip with Klay back
JJ sign a 10 day contract for the hec of it bro we really miss you 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
https://youtu.be/BqglvB8hNYE is a recap of Klay’s performance yesterday against the Cavaliers and the Warriors games this season
Klaaaay
Finally he’s back I’m happy for him
It was an average game in a 20 mins return to play, which is fantastic! The dunk is historic!
