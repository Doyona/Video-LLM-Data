Жду когда выйдет 2.2
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
im in pain trying to figure this out
Que bueno
How?
🧐🧐🧐🧐⚔️😭😭
What we need is a triple mode and more modes, orbs, speeds like: 5x 6x 7x 8x 9x 10x 20x and more, mode suggestions idk how you make this though..: 3d modes including: cube, ship, wave, spider, ball, and swing (i think thats all) so please make other portals like: vertical portal and a portal that goes like this: ↗️, ↘️, ↙️, and ↖️. And you can try to see what happens if you make a speed that makes you go backwards. We need tons of backrounds, grounds, and middle grounds (this is my suggestions for the next update!)
why does keyframe trigger look like that
Вышла 2.2!
I don’t know how to do this, and it does not show me a Thing is it just a added thing

Hi RobTop! I wanted you to show how the trigger Link Visibility works. Because it resets and dont work and I dont know what it does
2.2 вышла!
I’m really excited for this update now!
THIS IS REALLY HARDER
how do I use it
Robtop 2.2 is good I will thank you for making 2.2😊
Ok so theres some changes between this one and the one we have in 2.2, this version of keyframes originally used the animate trigger, but in 2.2, it uses a new trigger called the “keyframe” trigger, scaling and rotating didn't get any changes other then the fact, at this time, changes between rotation hasn't been made (at least to what can me seen in the video)
Very cewl robtop
is scam I try but not working 😢

Cool but pls delete "Round 1" bc I struggle on it in gdw
Bye bye move trigger
GD is Colones
How უθω
What do you use For key frame
Amazing! You know how much easier bossfights will be able to be created when this feature is out! Because honestly the move trigger takes to long to operate, this is extremely useful for people like me who don’t have 94 hours to operate move triggers for 7 eighths of that time,         Second comment: Finally, the animate trigger is useful now, it used to be just for aesthetic purposes, but now it can be used as a multi move trigger
Robtop cuál es tu nivel favorito 😶
I like music    No se si lo escribí bien hablo español
Pls can u make the app available again
pls add faster or app store will take u down 😭😭😭😭😭😭
Robtop pls where geometry dash 2.w
everyone excited? hopefully we will manage to invent time machines so we can actually play 2.2!

This would definitely make the move trigger a lot easier

🎉

Omg 😂

КАК?
ITS BEEN 8 MONTHS SINCE THIS VIDEO RELEASED????? WHAT???????
Aw damn skeleton
Me impacta 😃
gd feature length film
Ok!
I wonder what you can do with these things...
Do you want delete move, rotate, scale (2.2) triggers?!
wait that means you can make jiggle phisics cuz the skull can stretch and squash
man this is such a cool feature why does no one remember it         well i keep forgetting abt it too but still
This makes the move trigger useless now.
Why can’t I log into my Rob top account. I know my password exactly how I typed it I know my email exactly how I typed it. I know my username exactly how I typed it, so why can’t I log into my account please explain
As an animator who played geometry dash back in the day, I approve.
I can already see this feature being really useful for bossfight creation.
Разработчик отключить на русский язык что офигел какая цена на ГД версию geometry –did you douche я тебя прошу удали цену ГД пожалуйста 😭😭😭
Rob you make really cool games keep making updates
Finally, advanced aesthetics usable by people who arent insane
V
500 fps btw
The song reminds me of Fernanfloo
Robtop i want ads on real Geometry dash
Where did you get it I have 2.2
I have no need to use After Effects anymore
man made after affects in a video game
I bet someone is gonna make porn with this when 2.2 releases
Buenisimo
as soon as 2.2 comes out, can somebody make the video for the rickroll with this?
something that would be REALLY needed, especially to compensate for the lack of vectors, would be an erase tool, allowing us to cut out parts of objects as we wish.
RobTop you should add in 2.3 all these things: - cube orbs - ship orbs - ufo orbs - wave orbs - robot orbs - 2 new levels that includes all these things - new Zolguroth shop - new icons - new secrets - now all the shopkeepers of every shop you can click it as in the 2.2 new feature  - 5x speed portal (very insane) - new gamemode - new portal that includes that gamemode - new backgrounds
pog
If people dont know how rotate  is animate (help me i dont know how to write)
That one person: YoU StOle JiNiPEr'S FoNt

I wait new bug😁😁
The universe is about 100 light years long, but the WHOLE UNIVERSE IS 10B LIGHTYEARS, when all of that collapses, it will finally come out
This will make boss animations so much easier!
This will replace the move trigger
Robtop you are one of the laziest smartest people out there 🤣
Geometry Dash 2.2: The Video Editor update
When implement blockchain
Give robtop some time, patience is a virtue.
Hh waw
*2.2 drops* “he grandpa I found this game a wile back and 2.2 just came out” Me “son let me tell you a tale”
Waiting for 2.2
My great great great great grandchildren will love this
Trippy but cool
2.2 is going to change the forever
Ya quiero ver épicos niveles de geometry dash con estas nuevas herramientas !!!
Oh
I can't wait for my great great great grandchildren to get their hands on it I'm 2 btw
Hola
No wonder 2.2 has taken so long.  But seriously, this looks amazing. Can’t wait to see what creators make with this!
.
As someone who is VERY bad at building, I’m excited about how easy it looks to use!
This game is slowly becoming adobe animate
This is fuzro dash
👌
/rubrub
Looks pretty cool! I definitely see creators using this for a smoother transition than the move trigger in 2.2.
this is gonna make a bunch more troll levels possible
i dare you to get 69 creator points in 1 second
You can also generate a animate boss with toggle trigger in 2.1
Lil
geometry dash is turning into adobe animate in 2.2 i swear
м удачи
we are waiting for the developer update
where 2.2?
I guess move trigger is now useless
WOW!
Bro's recreating After Effects in the GD editor
goofy ahh levels in gd 💀
Hahaha, cool feature, I can see this thing slowly turning into aftereffects bruh or even already turning into unity..
WOW. Now you've really outdone yourself this time Mr Robert.
Really cool
UPDATE IT. RIGHT NOW.
YAAAAAAAAAAA WEY
Damn that must have taken forever to code. You'd have to make it detect  where all the points are and make the thing move to the points and detect if it's the last one or not well detecting where the things are to move the item to the place.
your cheating! [top left]
😯😲😯
За Россию
Hola Roptop Games Soy tu Fan numero 1
Nice
I’m excited to see people make such awesome levels that won’t animate at the last minute to kill you in the recent tab :D
Awesome

Apple has introduced a restriction that applications that have not been updated for several years will not be available for download in the app store and the author decided to make an update to iOS 16. In another case, the author did not release the update, if not Apple
Wow 👏

No.. there's a curve.. NOOOOOO
Cool new features :D
Nice :)

Wtf
Это новая и упрощённая эра. БОЛЬШЕ НЕ БУДЕМ СТРАДАТЬ С МУВ ТРИГЕРАМИ!
What about mobile?
if you go on gd lite theres an update and it has like portal skins and the change colour section is different theres way more colours and new icons and in the colour section it shows a swingcopter
Man it sucks I'm not good at creating levels. Hey maybe my grandchildren will be better when this update comes out!
this is what I call GEOMETRY dash
Can't wait to play the new Geomtry Dash 2077
Very cool👍
2.2 When Rob
Что то много снек пиков подозрительно
I wish geometry dash would add the song ily❤️❤️🎶🎶
Judith I understand that it will have been trying the 6 is on
Cool
This trigger will be perfect for animating instead of using move and alpha trigger
Ахвааваааааааававвавваав
😲🤠🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
Wow, it looks cool!
Wow
Con este sistema pueden hacer bossfight más detallados, Y no andar moviendo cada coso
this is the dumbest and funniest update ever
Who else is watching all of RobTops Videos while waiting for sneak peek 2
I can't wait for 2.2
AN ANIMATE TRIGGER TO ACTUALLY ANIMATE LETS GOOOO!!!!
WOW
Nice robert
Xender Game: my time has come
Q ay osvaldo
Amazing
It would be fun, but you can add Russian Greetings from Russia
This will help with my levels so much!!
Plataformer Mode in editor? Amazing!
Its a cool feature but move trigger would but use less now.. Rotate triggers can be useful too
Rob is just making us hack geometry dash tryibg to turn it into 2.2 ngl
Lo único que me caga es que todo está English 😒😒😒😒😒
Sneaky sneaky
Very uselful for animations
hey, you should add a system to add icons to the level, that is in art style, because having to do it is very time consuming, and also copying it from other levels is useless, since there are icons that you can't find. There are many levels that use icons as decoration and this will be faster, I hope you read me :)
That features are good
:') it's a dream come true
This is cool, but please stop adding new features and start bugfixing and polishing.
Yes i love geometrydash
sneak peek 2 when?
I hope patron & sponstron  are happy with this feature
you can't to oblige many peoples to play your levels to upload ¡NO! And your is a bad man
🤔🤔🤔🤯🤯🤯🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓

Hey robtop I have dare for you if you see this then here's my dare on geometry dash world if I reach 135 stars which is hard for me since I'm new if I reach 135 stars then you have to give me free access to the full version without making me pay for it!!

Is 2.2 being released on the 10th anniversary or something? Not trying To be impatient but it's been like 5 years since the last update, and it would be pretty cool if it was on the 10th year of GD. But for now we shall wait for another preview or hell, even a release date(which might never happen untill next(next) year).
can you do a how to add text video i wanna add texts but dont know how to
Everyone pls stop asking for things for 2.2. let 2.2 start
where's my sneak peek? i think i dropped it into the void
Rob pls fix the wave trail for mobile devices including for Android tablets and iPads not for PC and Mac

Why does geometry dash full version not work on mobile all it does is kick you out right as soon as you go in?
Maybe it could also change the color of the objects while moving, it would be very cool I think.
Robtob puedes meter más niveles en geometry dhas

Hey robtop your game no work 😭 your game crash 😭 No 2.1.1 no 2.2 please you got help me 🥺
nice
I can’t believe this video
@RobTopGames it says your game works for ipad but when i got it, it just says RobTopGames and exits me out of the app
Don't get me wrong, all this stuff is cool, and as an artist I know the importance of keyframes...  But the fact it's been over a year since the sneak peek, and FIVE AND A HALF YEARS since 2.1 released, is a sign that... Maybe it's time to draw the line on feature creep?
Can’t wait to see what I’ll be able to make after 2.2 comes out in 3792
Happy I’ll get the chance  to see this in my 30s (13 rn)
WOW  😊
Ok?
Cuando saldrá la 2.2
Robtop, si hablas español ¿me puedes responder esto?
Hi just a question I downloaded the geometry dash like the one you pay for it is not letting me go on it it crashes every time idk if it’s like that befause I have an iPhone 7 plus
No ahora enserio esto es una broma? Ya va para 4 semanas!!! Para hacer un vídeo de 15 segundos??? Creo que se está riendo de nosotros literalmente 😂
Hey Robtop. I have a question to ask... (Respond if you see this)

Robert, we've been waiting for 2.2 for five years...
O o omy gatttttt
Please correct the error crashes on iOS15
yo, ik I shouldn't be adding ideas, but I think that making a "console" in the settings available for speedhacking, noclipping really cool, and if this was added it should work like when you have speedhacks enabled (or noclip or smth else) even if you play a level, you wouldn't gain any percentage on it.

You need to use 2.2 it's Aug 29th, we need 2.2!

So, 2.2 for?
Stop being selfish and content hungry and give us an update. Stop making new stuff and release what you have now, save it for 2.3
its like a more advanced move trigger
Hola donde esta mi sneak peak?
New sneak peek is never coming, neither is 2.2 😔

wish the developer continued easy !
Sorry rob i love your game... but i quit....
Please just release 2.2... You just keep adding more features without even releasing the update... I feel like people might be overwhelmed by the amount of stuff suddenly added, they should at least get used to each feature one by one so they fully understand it
I Cannot Wait For The Upcoming Potential 2.2 Has!
Robert please realise 2.2

This is an advanced, easier and better version of Move, Rotate and other related triggers.  I love it.
Невероятно полезная функция. Она очень упростит создание движений объектов, что позволит уменьшить количество тригеров во много раз, а также упростит создание уровней для новичков

i love you rob
Oi can u pls fix geometry dash on iOS because we’ve all paid money to play the game and we would all appreciate it if u would fix the game on iOS.
It’s a very good for creating
robtop can you add notifications when you follow a player and posting a level?
funny
From what I can see the default interpolation is Bezier will we be able to change that to linear constant and things like random and ramp up/down   in lame mans terms, the spike travel from one place to another by acceleration a deceleration (beizer) wonder if I could make it stay the same speed through the transition (linear)  or make it start slow speed up and stop abruptly (ramp up) or make it start fast and slow down (ramp down) or make it randomly change speed through transition (random)  I don't know how difficult it would be to code, or how useful it would be to creators, but its worth a shot
fun fact: sneak peek was 1 year ago lol
Here we go again
прикольно
This is going to be a sick update
Cool
faster version of move trigger
I love this feature. Now Ill have to wait till I have a whole family, house, car, degree in applied genetics, the economic collapse, just for this?! I love it Rob keep up the amazing work :)
CONFIRMED RELEASE DATE :2050 is when the beta comes and then the actual update release is 2100
can’t wait for my reincarnated cockroach self in the years 4040 to play this
does anyone notice the new elephant icon???
I'm starting to think robtop already started uploading 2.2 but its so big it takes years to be uploaded. And he just hypes us up yearly.
Ты жииииив
in Geometrikal dominator to match bags
OMLLLL YOU MADE THIS ON MY BIRTHDAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY  @robtopgaming
Uh Ok
2.2 when I'm waiting
GD is one of the most frequently updated games and that's why I love it ❤️
bug report: If you die and restart the level at the same time 2 retry screens apear. Not major but please fix robtop
Where's the 2nd Sneak Peek
This man is adding more features to this one update than most major gaming companies can do in ten.
Won't this make the move trigger useless now?
This is going to make animation so much easier
This is the biggest update ever seen in Geometry Dash History. From a simple cube game of jumping into a game where you can make bosses, custom game modes, camera animations, and even more useful features. Every new update improves Geometry Dash little by little, but this update is just. So mindblowing to see really creative levels. So no more GDPS Editors or early access editors needed when 2.2 is out.
Más rápido Robtop
can't wait for 3022
10 years for this video XD
ho yea again?
2.2 release date :20XX
Their taking so long to release this that i lost interest in the game

Well friends, see you in 2028, this gossip goes a long way, many years for an update, this game is already more than dead
Can't wait for 2.2👍👍👍
Please update.
Dude this new tool looks easy and good to use, Nice job robtop
wow :D
Когда выйдет 2.2?
Necesito la 2.2 !! Y otra cosa,espero que ya se pueda jugar en iOS 13 y superior porque si no es así no podré jugarlo :(
2.2 when
This looks really cool and I cant wait to see what creators will do with it. Rob, you're doing a great job on 2.2 :D
Очень круто получается надеюсь моим внукам понравится🥰🥰🥰🥰
Why can’t I play geometry dash on iOS 15?
yo another robtop vid
Rob...here...2.2...will Avaible for mobile from full version
wahoo! :D
This is simply amazing. I absolutely cant wait to use this in 3022. Nevermind lol, 2.2 IS OUT!!!!!!
Hope I can play the game on my phone when 2.2 comes out. It just crashes when I click on it.
2.2 is here?
Oh noo... i can sense the creativity with this rising. I can tell that effects are gonna be really awesome.
Maybe this is too much, but for 2.3 (or other versions) I have an idea for a trigger: the video trigger, that the creator of the level puts a video in the trigger and the game recognizes the blocks of the video with those in the level and if in the video there are those blocks that move, rotate etc. the game does this automatically in the level.
Probably sneak 2 is gonna exit tomorrow
Whenever I hear this I instantly think of Colon’s video on rip-offs
maybe the sneak peak will come in next week
Why 2.2😡
wow can’t wait for this to  play this , Half-life 3 and gta 6 while watching gravity falls 3 in never!
Can't wait for next movies that would come in GD 😆
On all iPhones below iOS 16 geometry dash does open at all. A huge part of the community is missing out on playing the game and wondered if there was a fix for this coming soon
heart this robert jk lol
cool trigger
I love lt
Wow
Give Me All Skins And Colors Please
норм
W
Yes
Why can't some 2D animating studios be this easy, dang
the game is growing, too much
Lets GOOOO

"Did they like it?"  "I don't know. I don't speak spanish."
Даддададада

This is a miracle for animators
Cool
Zendergame is gonna have an absolute blast with this system.

Это конечно классная возможность , но что то мне подсказывает что воспользоваться ей мы сможем ещё не скоро .
GeoDash went from a music platformer to an Alternative to Adobe animate

Historic moment

Wow cant wait 18k years until this update finally gets a release date
Yay now i dont need to learn the move trigger in 2.2
i need this        WAIT HE'S ALIVE
i bet in 2.2 someone is gonna just spam a bunch if objects and use this feature to move them around to create the new recent level theme
2.2 is so exciting I heard GTA 6 would be released on the same day
No wonder 2.2 is taking years to come out
Wow
What an amazing feature! Can't wait for my kids to use it!
Buscando mujeres con un carro normal (solo los olds entenderan)

That's like project arrhythmia I am so excited
J'avais oublié qu'il devait y avoir la 2.2 ...  Ca fait des années que pleins de gens ont décrochés et ne savent même plus faire des niveaux verts... (un peu comme moi =') ) Il serait peut-être temps de la sortir et de garder le reste des idées pour la 2.3 non ? lol.
It’s feels more like bundled move, rotate, and scale…
When is next 2.2 info coming out
finally i can make geometry dash intercourse
Toop
So this is why 2.2 is taking so damn long     It's gonna be worth every second when it does come out
omg robtop did some coding after 5 years
NEW VIDEO
Since geometry Dash is almost a decade old, and 2.2 is a big update, does that mean that it will publish in 2023?
Robtop rate acheron
i know he said it’s gonna be optimized but gd lite is kinda laggier than 2.11
Can't wait. Already thought about 2.2 levels that I may make.
200 years after...
haha now i can make robtop wide and fat now
Epic the new sneek peak uffff xd
I hope we don't have to wait 2 more years for the 2.2 release
Fun fact: The 9 years post robtop retweeted wasn't about the anniversary...
When it comes out 2.2?

This is cool 2287 will be cool

Wow~ I hope you finish geometry dash 2.2
그니까 이거하겠다고 하지말고 빨리 만들어서줘...ㅈㅂㅈㅂㅈㅂ....
Выпусти эту версию уже блять!!!!
Will the new trigger be able to like go, to a straight line, up curve down, scale up and then curve down while scaling down?
if you don't hurry they can delete your game (just kidding it's true because of the rules of the play store
So Geometry dash is becoming a literal game engine in a game...
1 question: why does SubZero have before 2.2 controls/Keys and the you insert more 2.2 things?🤔🤔🤔🤔
Yeeeeeeeees
This seems really cool but I have one question, how will this work on mobile devices?
Cant wait to have my 100 year old grandson play this
I am so want 2.2
it will be very useful for beginners, I am sure it will be very actively used
*MAKE 2.2 COME OUT NOW PLEASE!!*
Good lord Robert, you are insanely skilled as a game developer (I’m assuming this isn’t going to crash a bajillion times when we try to use it? LOL)
NO WAY
kurva mode💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
YO
Better than After Effects...
geometry dash is slowly becoming like geometry dash subzero
like if robtop released 2.2
Damn can’t wait for 2067 levels!

Ill become a senior citizen once this update is fully released.
Yoooo that looks cool!
finally 2.2
Roptop dale pasame la 2.2 por bluthu💀
Love the concept
Nice, this feature looks really cool and intuitive to use. Maybe it'll help people get into level building, say, in about, 40 years.
This is way better than using MOVE trigger
When 2.2?
This will make things SO much easier to move in the editor, ESPECIALLY for me. I'm pretty bad at move triggers
Робтоп когда выпустишь 2.2

Auto community is happy
And you still can’t play it on iPhone

I think at this point the community is struggling to care because they just want to play the update. I've just stopped playing at this point because I've lost interest it's been that long.
it's been over a year daddy plz just release 2.2 already

Feature looks extremely cool. Can't wait to see how people creatively use this trigger to make some really amazing levels!

when is this shit dropping
That's so cool! Can't wait to see what amazing things my great grandchildren make with it!
I'm not sure if RobTop will even be alive by the time 2.2 comes out. Maybe he'll pass on the job to someone else.
spu7nix is gonna get a kick out of this
When comes 2.2
People are going to make edits and full on animations on funny jump game now
YEEEEES
Can wait till spunix gets ahold of this
1 Entire Years From This...

Jeez, I sure love getting excited about new cool editor features while barely getting even the layout stage of my own levels
Can't wait for my great great grand children to experience such an update
Rob! Is this in 2.2 or 2.3 or 2.4?
Ngl I was kinda firstly disappointed by it.  But then I started to think about it.  This is literally amazing.
Wow.

FINALLY NEW VIDEO
ah yes, robtop my favourite youtuber

I literally just watched lemoncake react to this and say that 2.2 is never coming because of previews
I figuratively and literally can’t wait for this to come out in 2.2!
Where is 2.2
Can't wait till someone make a whole short animation movies with geometry dash
Woah Thats So Cool Robtop!! But You Are Delaying The Update Can You Release The Update As Soon As Possible?
imagine white space sequels when this is released
Yooooo this is an amazing feature I can't wait for it to release in 69420
Rip individual triggers/buttons: Move trigger, Scale, Rotate trigger
пон
Ohhhhh shit 2.2 gonna be packin
Бля дропни обнову уже
geometry dash crashes when i open it on iPhone, can you fix this?
We really have been through a pandemic and 2.2 still didn't come out bruh 😭😭💀
сука когда обнова?
When does the update release?
WOWWW W
Can you please make it Less laggy in 2.2 in mobile bc some player is getting kinda bit disappointed about fps drop bc they can't play some of there favorite level and I've been supporting geometry dash for many years on mobile so it would be better to make some thing that can make mobile player can play gd without having a fps drop and thank you
2.2 к окончанию 4 мировой возможно и появится
what
move trigger was honestly poorly made but this is Soo much better just imagine the boost of players and appeal of lvls when 2.2 releases
good
This looks so cool I hope the next generation of gamers use this feature properly
OH THANKS
Wat rilis geometri Dash  2.2
Sneak peek 2 Is when?
This is how i actually thought people moved objects in the editor the first time i downloaded the game , for half an hour i was trying to figure out how til i watched a tutorial
iOS 15.6 crashes
GEOMETRY DASH
Moving objects just got a whole lot easier
When will 2.0 come out?
Wow
2.2 when
He's legit gut making a game engine at this point.  Scripting- can be pulled off with triggers.  spawn trigger can act as function. some sort of if statement with count triggers, can only count interger values tho. prob only functional programming only, no oop. Variables can only be global interger values (but... almost anything can be represented as an interger value if you know what type the variable is)  Animation - move trigger and now a trigger KEYFRAME TRIGGER!  Collision - object and trigger  Graphics - you have a whole arsenal of stuff the skies the limit, jesus...  Gameplay - various speeds, jump pads, portals, sizes, game modes (ie. dual or platformer)   Save game- can be done with a key system, can't write something to disk tho.  Sound effects - eh not really. (Maybe could be done with a VERY polished system where a ng song has various sound effects, and when you do something the song trigger moves to that sound in the song, you would also probably have to make a bunch of spawn triggers detecting how long EACH SOUND IS so when that sound is done it then goes back to a silent part in the song so it doesn't keep playing other sounds)   Music - either or, sound or music. Cant play two songs at once in gd. Would work the same as the sound trigger, but with music and a sound looping system.  Editing to add some more...  Camera - trigger to control it.  Shaders - trigger, can do many screen effects now.  GUI - can be possible, but way harder without a simple mouse detecting trigger...
I can't wait for 2.2
ribpot do be gaming
Yay new video
This will make animating way easier. But there's no point because move trigger and alpha trigger exist.
Вот какую длительность видео мы заслуживаем за год когда не было видео на канале RobTop Games
OHMAHGHOD NEW 2.2 UPDATES OMFG AAAAAAAA
Rob where two dot two???
When is this coming out?
How did u make that :o
P epic
I love it, can't wait to see it in 2090
🔥🔥🔥🔥
500fps?????
Hey Jesus Christ here, how about adding a feature called "Remove assigned groups" where when you select a trigger a button pops up, then if you press the button it will automatically remove all assigned groups of the trigger.
Meant to say hiped not hoped
Is anyone here hoped for 2.2 though?
4 years
Amigo como haces todo esto es genial
2 . 2
More progress has been made
will your phone feel heavier after the latest update?, because it hasn't been updated for a long time, it's likely that many features will be added later
I should make a breaking bad series into this lol
Gonna be fun to play with when I’m 80
Honestly cant wait
Wait Rob stop adding too much just release 2.2 xD
i cant wait for my grandkids to see it
For the first time in 69 years, RobTop uploaded a new movie. I'm amazed :)
Bruh working on sneak peek 2
имба для картоделов
Robtop go go go 2.2
Recent tab levels are all going to be free demon levels
Gamers, i would like to remind you that 2.2 releases at an undetermined point this year, this year, at last the wait of not knowing what year it will release is over, now its time to see when it will release this year...
Oh,rubrub is coming :)
М

Wow

What?
When 2.2
Finally after so long we finnaly get another video from RobTop himself. Thank you for the sneak peeks.😆🤣
So......when 2.2
Дропай уже

I’m scared how difficult Demon  Levels will be in the future
а теперь вещи которые никто не заметил  новый шрифт видимые хитбоксы стартовая точка для платформеров

Игроки: 6 лет ждут 2.2 Роб:  ДА ГОСПАДИ ОПЯТЬ ТУТОР ДЕЛАТЬ ЧТОБЫ ВСЕ ДУМАЛИ ЧТО ОБНОВА СКОРО
I like this :)

THIS IS SICK
Ты обещал обнову 2201 очень где!
Wow really cool 👍
More thing are coming
I can't wait for 2.2
I can’t play gd on my tablet cuz it’s broken 😩😩😩😩
Al fin xd
After seeing the robotop upload after a long time, I have a feeling that the geometry dash will update
Waiting for the update in a year
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
RobTop!
This feature is so fudging useful can't wait to get my hands on it later on
Hyper will surely improve on these new updates
Слушай ты сперме масиве гамес выпускай 2.2
So when will 2.2 come out i know its gonna be a BIGGEST update yet but i cant wait so when will it come out
Rip 2.2(
:0 as a YouTuber from my country that is Mexico says AHORA SI BIENE LO CHIDO :"D
Real neato👍
thanks, now i can make better movements for blocks to build something more decent than before
Just, wow
ultra violence is now easier to make lol don't have to use a thousand move trigger just to animate
Low obj level though? Wow
I can now animate, ah yes time to destroy the whole wor- I mean uhh nothing
RobTop wtf!?
woah. this is amazing. no wonder this update took forever!
Can’t wait for 2.2 to come out! :D
Quit making awesome thing robtop.
Muy genial y todo 👌🏻👏🏻 pero algunos como yo,no entendimos el video 😂
RELSIXE DATE
Will this come out soon?
Dis epic
UPLOAD TELL RELIZS DATE
The biggest advantage this feature alone gives is the amount of objects lessened to created such movement, I will assume a lot of creators will have their levels filled with the animate trigger for precise movement.
2.2 pe
ROPTOP NEW VID POG
Esta muy bien pero la 2.2
Top)
Update yah!!!  Please
Se vienen cositas 🔥🤑🥶
2.2 выйдет .... Потому что роб НЕ ленивый как всегда.... Вовремя он... Выпустил снек пик, демонстрируя: новые блоки, новые трикеры, система аккаунтов и мультиплеер, так много всего! А всё потому 2.2 выйдет.

Roptop is gonna work from iOS now?
When will 2.2 sneak peek 2 come out?
i cant imagine how 2.2 auto levels would look like
Honestly, I remember this game, it was awesome. The thing is, before I quit the game, I was looking forward to this exact update. Now it’s 4 years later and it’s still not out yet. This is why I stopped playing, I think it just takes to long for the updates, just my opinion.
someday
after effects in geometry dash wow
My grandchildren will love this!!
The level is  Difficult
The level is  Difficult
is it still missing for 2.2 to come out?? •́  ‿ ,•̀
this genuinely looks very cool. I just love the fact that it's implemented soo well
can't wait to watch movies in gd
i really hope robtop has like 100000x backups of the source code

. . . :0
oooo
And yet I still don't know how to do anything in a level besides place stuff like blocks and spikes, changing the background, and changing the music. I have no idea how people get fancy pixel art in their levels
This will be awesome!
Hi ROBTOP! I have some ideas that you could implement in the future update 2.2...  1° Make some objects use as a mask to other objects. That will facilitate the creation of the "BG". 2° Make the trigger "lents circle" only "lents" and that in the trigger configuration you can choose the shape that will have, such as squares, circles, stars etc ... many more figures, the same with the "wave shock". 3° and the last one would be that the "invert color" triger call "negative" and that this can be configured to these areas of the screen to carry out more effects, you could create an invisible block during the gameplay which serves as a mask for the trigger and thus be able to make the negative effect by zones have movement with other triggers...  it would be great!...  Please 🙏
just release it PLEASE JUST ADD MORE FEATURES AFTER PLEASE!!!
Wait... GD COLON???
Rub rub geometry dash lite agree:blast prossesing,theorie of everthing 2 and geometrical dominator

Can You Imagine How Difficult Extreme Demon In Version 2.2
I'm tired of waiting, half of the players too, it's an indisputable fact that half of the community will not care about the update, because it hasn't been released for a long time, there weren't even hints of it for a long time. Do you know what the person who was waiting for the update would say? "I don't care, I moved on to another game a long time ago."
Will move and rotate triggers stay in the game?
THAT IS BEAUTIFUL
Can't wait for 2.2 this decembsuamarpril!
Hey Now It will be easier for Bossfight creators to make Bossfights for Me MUHAHAHAHAH

Якакашка

robtop isn't going to update 2.2. he's just gonna keep adding random stuff and then never update it.
its amazing how far this game has come, from a simple copy of impossible game to one of the greatest mobile rhythm/platformer games out there!
Robtop is like apple, Simple but needed
Робтоп пожалуйста скажите что зделать,у меня небезопасный пароль я не знаю что сделать ,дорогой робтоп зайдите на мой акаунт  Мой ник sjsujs пожалуйста скажите что сделать.

WOOOOOW
Через год выйдет еще одно видео на 30 секунд с показом новых кубов
TELL US WHEN 2.2 IS PLEASE
Ждём
👍
Yo robtop how much longer is it gonna take for you to drop the update man? How long does it actually take to make a sneak peek ? You had an entire WEEK as you said, and all we get is a 32 second video, after this many years?
congrats on 10 million
OMG
Hey robtob what’s the problem with geo dash on iPad 6 it doesn’t work so I f u can try to fix it
WHEN IS 2.2 OUT ON MOBILE ROBTOP  PLEASE RELEASE IT ON MOBILE AND ALSO ON STEAM PLEASE
2.2 is evolution
wow
amaizing!
Wow. One more fact why i waiting 2.2
Love you RubRub ❤
I came here to feel my childhood.
R.i.p 2.2 doesn't exist memes and hello 2.2
Finally, Animate is useful now !
now I understand why 2.2 hasn't been released for so long, wow
This is gong to be so useful in new levels and will make some levels super cool
Thanks Thanks
Just please fix the mobile crash glitch. People paid for this game and can’t get past the loading screen.
Wat
There goes the move trigger
ITS BEEN 5 YEARS ROBTOP
We missed you
Hello RobTop when 2.2?
No more move trigger
그래서 언제 나와
We need geometry dash 2.2 in this year
*its been 20 years robtop...*
This is cool ngl
Robtop pls update geometry dash and geometry dash world plssssss
when is 2.2 gonna come out
R.i.p 2.2
THE LAST ONE THO
WOOOOOOOOW
levels will be impossible to get rated in 2.2, a good update but it might be the end for alot of creators.
The more I need to wait, the happier I will be to play 2.2 !!!
Finnaly creators won't have to use 2.3sx move and rotate triggers, just to make animated 1/8 of level
I cant wait to see all the new levels with the animate trigger!
ahuet'
Бедный робтоп, старался, ролик аш целый год делал☺️
At this point 2.2 is such a large update that we should just call it 3.0
Fernanfloo music yay
6 years robtop, ITS BEEN 6 YEARS, JUST RELEASE IT ALREADY.
We need balls
SHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESH
I'm so glad you added this! Not only does it make the animate trigger a lot more useful, it makes it less trigger heavy and optimized when it comes to creating animations!!! It will be so much fun to experiment with this!!!  This is really exciting!!!
:O
С этой функцией будет дохрена всего крутого... Хотя.. О чём я? 2.2 итак будет крутой, чтобы там ни говорили вернам и т.п.
XD no creo que me responda no creo que robtop me entienda el español
Just shapes and beats refence
Robtop please give me link to dowloand this version geometry dash for test
ОООООО
Cool
I think it is not so easy to use the editor mode but this could change everything 😎
Xender game: aw, good idea, les make 2.2 level
RIP move Tigger
not bad
I love you robert
You know. As much as I am excited for this update. I am more excited for if you guys will add an update with Christmas levels to make the players more engaged, and around that time of year you get a special Christmas cube. don't take my word on it but it's just a suggestion I would really love to see. If you ever do read this them for listening and hope you pin it so I can change up the comment to the communities preferences <3
My prediction is 2.2 will come out in 2023 or 2024
10 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS!!!!!!!!
When the game developer falls to feature and keeps adding game-breaking features that continually delay the update! 😳   Okay this is unironically really good and I might be able to create now that the move trigger is usable to people like me who don’t want to count pixels
We need this
You back
oh my god
Didn't realize the 1st 2.2 sneak peek was already a year
1 año esperando video para esto :V
Or maybe Rob is done with 2.2 but won’t give it to the public
wow robtop should feel good because he finally finished some of the update!
Alfin 😎
looks like robtop uploaded a video in 1 year ago🤭
Can't wait to use this in my 80s
This increible!!
ROOBTOOOOP I LOVE YOU
It’s been 6 years Robert
When 2.2 well come out
Editor examples 5
gd slowly turning into editing software
rubtop omg wirnfin
I think we all know that update will be released in december 2022 (u know 2022=2.2 and robtob like to released games in that month ;)
Animations would be  alot easier with this.
No more move triggers, but this is way better
premiere pro and after effects be like
woooo
Muy chida la 2.2
this will be for explorers
2.3?
Yea
hey robtop for when the 2.2
Now geometry dash is a literal game engine
okay im interested now
Hey, Rob. I have one word                                                              \                                                      melom thanks for listening to my peptalk
and the snake?
2.2 when
Recent levels
i'm here before 1M views
This is a good goodbye to GD :')
Wow
and I stayed all day waiting for the sneak peak ;(
Me when robtop said if things go well 2.2 will release in July. I guess things did not go well
Good idea!!
cant wait for my great great great great great grand children to play 2.2
Tremenda kgada, para esa chingadera tardaste 5 años?
I can't believe it!!
Omggggg
Para cuando la 2.2   Ya a pasado años
Pa cuando la 2.2
This makes it better when making these kinds of things. Currently, you have to edit X to maintain in the players screen as a base and put a bunch of move triggers to make them move around
Ya saca la sneak peek 2.2 pinche robtop >:(
When is 2.2 gunna be released? I’m excited📐
2.2😍🔥
Suggest for 2.3: Add Portal JetPack and You can fly straight up
COOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
New update to GD demo and now this? This is amazing :D Can't wait for 2.2 orginal version
and I liked the new mechanics😃😃😃😃
RobTop, who is JinxDaSinister
I don't care if it's late, I'm fine as long as it's out
This is going to lead to some BEAUTIFUL levels. I can't even imagine how creators will use this to its max!
2.2 has the train of hype at +200% of its capacity...
Nm
recent levels are going to be so bad and i love that
They’re about to make Fortnite in geometry dash
sneak peek when
Nice features but the update was gonna be better if you were slowly adding new features with smaller updates for example once every 2 months…You made too many changes to this game and that’s why it takes so long…A game should be updated at least once every couple of months,not once every 5 years🥲
2.2 WHEN PLS TELL ME
this is test that roptop is still alive :D
Queeeee vamos a tener eso :0
If only it came out
(This is no shitpost) Guys there is a hacker in gd that wants to hack into zobros's account and we need to stop him! (Video about that coming 15:00 germany time)
when does 2.2 come out?
We technically won't need most of the triggers with this.
YES MORE FOOTAGE
When will 2.2 come out for mobile devices
I will probably have grandchildren when 2.2 is released
Поскорее бы 2.2
This is going to be fantastic. I can’t wait to see what creators build with this in the year 3000.
Gay thats gay
move trigger rotate trigger and scale trigger when animation trigger shows up
Nexus: This will be amazing. Im gonna make it blow
rob, the sneak peek!!
Cool wont get pinned
U almost done?

Finally, the animate trigger is useful!

this feels weird, like minecraft vertical slabs
omg
I love geometry dash I ask my dad to give me his phone every night he comes home

Joke very cool waiting for 2.2
yeah 2.2 editor is basically: a game engine, an art and animation program, a computer, an editing software and more  cant wait for people to recreate geometry dash inside geometry dash, by first making a pc from the ground up, make a game engine, recreate GD then run GD in said engine and pc
I’m on mobile and my game is not working I downloaded the full version but still cool
Второй сник пик которого мы достойны 🤣🤣🤣

Robert impressed us somehow, can't wait to see my grandchildren enjoying it!

Gd 2.2 will in 2200

Is there going to be beans?
This is pretty much just raising the standard of what’s considered "a featurable level"...  Man my levels are gonna SUCK

Урааа
We are hoping 2.2 Happens 2022
OMG!
Nice
Can't wait for the change to cat icon feature 😈😈😈
Wanjay
Robop!!!!!!!
There's only 3 possible paths that may happen after the release of 2.2 1 - Many levels gonna be created with 2.2 triggers ( Rip phone users ) 2 - the community gonna be expanded and levels will increase its upload rate 3 - no one gonna play it cause it sucks ( will never happen
OMG NOW VIDEO OMG OMG OMG

Наконец-то от Роберта вышло видео
Holy shit now i dont need to use a million moves and triggers just to animate a series of objects ~3~ optimization has never felt so good.
Wow! Soo coooollll!!!
:O
frame by frame feature: *exist animation meme creator: "allow us to introduce our selfe"
Ok .. and the sneak peek?
Esto hara de que la forma de animación sea mas facil 👍👍
Slept like a log last night … woke up in the fireplace.
I was making a level the other day and I wanted to make something like this, but it requires to many move and rotate triggers. Now I look at Robtop's YT and I'm like "No way"
Really cool to use in 2033😃👍🏼
I'M CRY NOW
So when’s 2.2 coming out?
THIS IS GONNA BE AMAZING. i love everything related to moving objects and this just makes everything better. Cant wait!
They already released the sneak peck 2?￼

This is a good fit, Why isn’t it on consoles yet?
Decepción

2.2 will just turn Geometry Dash into After Effects
Lets be honest: it wont ever come out. And I stopped playing until 2.2 actually does come out
No hay que dudar que la 2.2 será muy genial!!
New feature cool for new people in the creator system :)
Y ahora para cuando la actualizacion, ya dejandonos de joda Robtop?? Ya esperamos mucho 🙄🙄😬

Why i'm always shocking when this guy upload a new video?

New extreme demons?
(We are in the end of times. Repent and be baptized. Turn to God.) Isaiah 45:22 Turn to me and be saved, all you ends of the earth; for I am God, and there is no other. Acts 2:38 Peter replied, "Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit." (Pray and fast) Philippians 4:6 Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. Joel 2:12 “Even now,” declares the Lord, “return to me with all your heart, with fasting and weeping and mourning.” (Turn to Jesus while there is still time.) John 14:6-7 Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. If you really know me, you will know my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him.” John 3:16 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. John 3:18 Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son. John 8:36 So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed Luke 18:20 You know the commandments: ‘You shall not commit adultery, you shall not murder, you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony, honor your father and mother.’” (Follow the Two Greatest Commandments) Matthew 22:36-40 “Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?” Jesus replied: “ ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’ This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.” (These will NOT inherit the Kingdom of God) 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. (The absolute truth of God's Word) Hebrews 4:12 For the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart. Romans 10:17Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word about Christ. 2 Timothy 3:16-17 All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.  (Present Signs) Luke 21:20 When you see Jerusalem being surrounded by armies, you will know that its desolation is near. 2 Timothy 3:1-5 But mark this: There will be terrible times in the last days. People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, without love, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of the good, treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God— having a form of godliness but denying its power. Have nothing to do with such people. Matthew 24:4-5 Jesus answered: “Watch out that no one deceives you. For many will come in my name, claiming, ‘I am the Messiah,’ and will deceive many. Matthew 24:6 You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come. Luke 21:10 -11Then He said "Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom. There will be great earthquakes, famines, and pestilences in various places, and fearful events and great signs from heaven. Matthew 24:14 And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, then the end will come. 1 Timothy 4:1-2 The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons. Such teachings come through hypocritical liars, whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron. (God's anger through weather) Psalms 18:7-12 The earth trembled and quaked, and the foundations of the mountains shook; they trembled because he was angry. Smoke rose from his nostrils; consuming fire came from his mouth, burning coals blazed out of it. He parted the heavens and came down; dark clouds were under his feet. He mounted the cherubim and flew; he soared on the wings of the wind. He made darkness his covering, his canopy around him— the dark rain clouds of the sky. Out of the brightness of his presence clouds advanced, with hailstones and bolts of lightning. (Deny yourself to be a follower of Christ) Mark 8:34-35 Then he called the crowd to him along with his disciples and said: “Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me. For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me and for the gospel will save it. (Confess Christ) Matthew 10:32-33 “Whoever acknowledges me before others, I will also acknowledge before my Father in heaven. But whoever disowns me before others, I will disown before my Father in heaven. (God demonstrated His Own Love for us) Romans 5:8 But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us. (Help others in need) Romans 12:13 Share with the Lord’s people who are in need. Practice hospitality. (Keep the Sabbath Day Holy) Exodus 20:11 For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but he rested on the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy. Make disciples of ALL nations.Spread the gospel. Matthew 28:19-20 I suggest to download the audio Youversion Bible app & have it playing day & night when you sleep to learn & stay in tune of God's Word. Stay in prayer and repent. Questions, Prayer requests, Bible study or just to talk about God, our Creator. See my page or email: beprepared100 at yahoo. I'm sharing the Word of God. God is the ONLY ONE who can save us with everything going on. God bless you. Jesus loves you.

If this gets 100 likes I will play gd everyday until 2.2
It would be so awesome, it would be so cool
Wait im confused, so the animation with the skull you only used 5 frames, yet the animation is so clean. Im wondering if it gives you a free transition between frames, because the frames were quite far from each other.
why add an effect that will never come out
Woah
RubRub is 2 cool for my phone so its gotta boom 💥💥💥
I can't imagine what's next 😵💥🧠
Ого
it's been a year
Cool
GD 2.2 pls :-D

Al pedo tanta cosa, ya perdiste a casi todos tus jugadores
ARG ARRGGG
I hope RobTop knows that Geometry dash is completely unplayable on IOS devices
Wow. I can't wait for 2079 for this to release!
2.2 не выйдет:(

Analyzing this deeper, robtop is showing a lot of things here. New icons, new fonts, why does the cube stop when it hits the animate trigger? What is the purple line shown behind it before the level starts?

Looks like I ain't needing premiere pro anymore
Xender game: let's make a simple boss fight
Holy shit an upload, lets go
This song got me twerking and shi
I can't even imagine levels people will make in 2.2, creators like Knots, Serponge, ViPriN will KILL IT! At the same times well-known bossfight creators like HHyper and XenderGame will destroy your RTX 6000 PC •-•. But still, they're levels will be SICK!        Btw, that elephant icon looks FIRE, and also the recent tabs gonna be SHIT so make sure ur ready for that..
RobTop ты топ!
OMG
Time for the traditional "Can't wait for 2.2" comments again
Мне кажется, что обновления meltdown и subzero это не просто так!
When 2.2 comes? ROBTOP?!  (When impostee is sus? DABABY?!)

small thing i noticed: That font isnt in the game yet.. so possibly we have new fonts coming! edit: another thing I realized: another new icon is going to be in the game! (elephant)

NOOOO I MISSED IT  oh well😐
Cool!
Wow es ... GENIAL
We're gonna have someone making a literal Geometry Dash anime opening once this is out.

Hey rob WHAT is the day of the second sneak peak?
@RobTopGames please give us 2.2
:o
Al fin nuevo video de robtop! ,🤗
I love the concept but it just makes me wanna get 2.2 even more
So you're telling me you have created a non-laggy, less time consuming animation studio.          Hell yeah!
Omg robtop PLEASE stop making so many ambitious changes I just want the game to get an update already 😭
Grandchildren gonna enjoy this more than i do
We don’t want sneak peeks we want 2.2

y?
When the fuck is 2.2 coming out
Ancioso por la 2.2 se acerca chic@s no se rindan 💪🤩
pin me i need attention
This looks amazing! I cant wait to see what creators use this for when this update comes out
wow
😯
Оцените мой контент, очень классная зборка чернухи 🤡😂
Remember that we first thought it only would be Platformer, Cameras and 2 New gamemodes in the start, now we are at goddamn Animations and Keyframes
This will definitely fuel GD creators' levels to the brim. Can't we grant Robtop enough respect for that?
Épico 😎
0.o
something that I see that nobody talks about is that they may add more sources to the Geometry Dash
Мы ждали это год🥳🥳
Woh
2.2 when?
Es 8 en tendencias :0
bro, your work is going so GOOD
1. If you adding 2.2 to full version then add 2.2 to gd world 2. The animation group is looked amazing 3. Cant wait for 2.2
that's a nice concept, too bad it aint gettin released anytime soon
I dont how much years it has been since last update but I stopped caring. Its so sad that the game I was addicted to was killed by lack of updates
Imagine how much supplier it would be to create bosses with this
Yessss
RIP move trigger
Cool elephant icon👍👍👍
So theoretically, a dynamic level could be made without move triggers using only follow triggers and this thing.
Аче Всмысле
ого... круто... прекрасно... хаха лол... аче всмысле... пресс старт момент?.. ада это так работает...
Bro I just want to play gd from my ipad pls
Bro it will take long time to learn everyting about 2.2
When will it come out
Everybody asks when's 2.2? But nobody ever asks How's 2.2?
Ye
We needed this. You’re an amazing developer rob
Это скам?
Geometry Dash is now far from just Geometry
After a few years, you finally figured out a new feature to add to 2.2 👏
I have always wanted sth like this !!!!!!

Imagine how long the building tutorial is gonna be…
do the arrow things work as normal blocks?
ayo a new editing software??
Ñ
Incredible....
I have an idea.since this update is going to take a long time why don’t you split it in half like what mojang did in Minecraft with the 1.17 and 1.18

I can't wait for this SmAlL uPdAtE to come out !
Can't wait to 2.2...
ЧЗХ, робтоп всё ещё делает 2.2 ?!?!?!?!?!??!?!

Amazing!
I cant To WAIT 2.2 UPDATE
Les go rotop
This is great for creators!
RobTop, pls tell when 2.2 out?
32 место в тренде
Geometry dash 2.1 - standart game, Geometry dash 2.2 - game maker
Wow
RubRub, can you go onto gd, search DashrProGamerGD, press my levels and make Fetre Lvel (the newest lvl) and feature it? It’ll help a lot and make it as magic and vertify the coins? It’ll help alot. Also can u comment on it and rate it easy? And maybe make it a daily lvl?
2.2 is basically gonna be an entirely different game at this point
Wow!
Yoooo theres no 2.2 never coming jokes
Cool BUT ….. the GD editor is so complicated that it is harder to learn than SolidWorks. All the new features will only be used by the ones who know the editor since 1.9. A newbie in 2.2 will be completly lost. (Were is sneek peek 2 Rob, its been one week come on !)
Boss fight re ganna be good in 2.2
o
2.2 is going to be a game engine at this rate lol
ичо
holy crap we might actually get an update
2.2 не выйдет никогда...
Ого
лучше бы обнову выпустили
Wow, looks amazing, just thinking about how many things we can create with this...
looks cool!
2.2 is coming yeah
This sneak peek is the Best!
Noice matte

Hey you back!
Мув тригер: я для тебя шутка?
Robtop is just bezy  with the things we don't know
This looks so good I can't wait
There is still hope thanks robtop
Cool
Cant wait i hope 2.2 will come out soon 🙂
WOWEEE
w oo w
WHEEEN  2.2 ?!?
i have been waiting 6 years for an update, i was 12, still a kid, and now im 18 ans have real problems to worry about including a geometry dash update
you took something that was really complicated and made it really easy  best game dev seriously
Ah yes, the new moviemaker engine
!!!??? A
finally robtop read my mind and added a trigger that combines move/rotate/scale/toggle/alpha
AAAAAA HOLY THIS IS RRREVOLUTIONAL AAAAAAAAAAAAAA
10 Mil subs robtop let's celebrate
This makes me look forward to 2.2 even more!
I've been joking to wod about 2.2 for like 5 years or something
Honestly, 2.2 might just be called 3.0 at this point
People are gonna make every Episode of Dragon Ball Z in GD now.
2.2.... pls 🙏
WOW
2.2 when?
очень круто!!! хорошо что гд 2.2 идëт к лучшему!!! удачи в завершении версии игры!!!
Holy geometry a new gd video
5 YEARS FOR AN UPDATE BRO
Can't imagine what 2.2 levels look like...
Looks really good can't wait for 2.2
another sick upload from robert
Okay, that's really cool, I never thought about something like that. I thought we already know everything what's coming in 2.2 and Robtop still manages to impress us. You're wonderful, Rob.
My favorite part was when RobTop said ”It’s Geometry Dash 2.2 Keyframe System time”. I almost started crying
this is the greatest keyframe system of ALL TIME
Move, scale, togle and rotate trigger😭
отлично, хоть одно видео за год.
Can't wait to play in my 90s
lol looks cool
Is this the second 2.2 Sneak Peek?  I thought you'd show us the Explorers level...
I like to play geometry dash
I can already see how this is gonna help a lot of creators big times!
когда уже блять?
OMG LETS GO
2.2?
2.2 is evolution :O
Wow cool
Honestly I love every single feature that this new update will bring! Except for the screen flipping. We’re so used to GD going in a straight line and to all of a sudden have the screen moving all about like 3Dash is something that can trip you up. Love everything else though! And that’s the only thing I’m not fond of.
I’m gonna be confused to crap about this! I rarely ever use animate triggers so this is kind of a problem! Also, can someone please come and tell me how you use dynamic triggers?
Me be like: Waiting for Geometry Dash update on Mobile.
I am waiting 2.2
Wow
Normal lvls:no Auto lvls:yes! Yes! Yes!....... YEEEEES!!!!
Ooh
Can you stop adding features already?
Can’t wait for 2.2   Especially because I can’t play on my phone until it’s out
Топчик!
LETS GO A NEW LEAK
Jesus christ this is getting to the point the game is becoming a literal animation engine
2.2 when fuck
holy shit he updated the animate trigger
please rob 2.2 this year please 🙏
2.2 when
2.2 whan
next day 2.2
2.2 gonna be awesome, prolly be worth the wait
COOL!! (I am Russian)
OMG
ало где обнова
Is 2.2 coming on phone and tablet
OK but you didn’t tell us how much more years
yay another 2.2 upload any thoughts on 2.2 release? like, what month? *plz september*
интересно когда выйдет
OMG
So that's what was taking this long. \*Hands on the hips*
I'm so excited for 2.2 I hope it's gonna be fun to play and create the level so I can try it out myself.   This is going to be fun!!!
Now i can make some animation 😆
This is amazing, wow

2.2 не выйдет никогда, потому что роб ленивый как всегда
Another rubrub upload
2.2 не выйдет никогда
Perfect for troll levels
Love it… 2.2 looking promising to come soon!
This art is max level bro I'm so excited for 2.2    By coming soon robtop means COMING NE-
Страшно представить, какой бум случится после выпуска 2.2, и главное, чтобы обновление успело в срок, ибо больше комьюнити ждать не может
This is going to be so useful and cool
Да! Я люблю цим!
is 2.2 will out?
It's okay to update now, so please update as soon as possible. Please update the function from version 2.3.
2.2 please
Robtop podría hacer actualizaciones pequeñas, añadiendo este tipo de cosas, y el juego estaría mil veces más vivo, no se cual es la necesidad de hacer actualizaciones enormes y olvidarse del juego por años. La comunidad se exprime todo el contenido nuevo en unos días, y si hiciera actualizaciones pequeñas esos días no se sentirían rápidos porque quizá en unos meses haya alguna novedad.
Sorry but this is taking years
Omg
Вау
This good
Goodbye formula to move
Sneak peak 2 will never came out
No estamos preparados para la actualizacion
:0
Wow, Rob, its look very cool, very good job 🗿👍
can you say hi to me robtop please
Hold on brb gonna make anime on the GD editor
This is sooo cool
Holy crap I can actually have movement in my levels without needing to know exactly how many pixels I want a singluar block to move by the millisecond
i am excited
make accessible for newer iPhones please thx

Waat
It is very cool
WOW

Can't wait to see what done with this in 10 years when 2.2 gets released!
Robtop on his way to add more features in 2.2 so he would spend less time making 2.3
interesting
This game is dying easily
2.2 when?!!
Ждём ещё 2 года до выхода 2 снек пика
Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh
"Needed to create some effects in the level and thought it turned out pretty cool" RubRub moment, literally every feature is created FOR HIS NEEDS
Robert, please add in 2.2 the ability to write punctuation marks in the level name! This will help a lot of creators and players a lot.
:0
WOW
2.2 when? 🫲😭🫱
avoid the animated trigger spike game i wanna make maybe or smth
OMG finally new sneak peek!!!!!!!
Well, now we need to wait another 2 years for the next video
Bruh, Why don't you release the game as it is now? And releasing updates on the way, we didn't ask for much :(
let us know when the official 2.2 update is available
I hope 2.2 will be in 2022
Nice.
This will make creating good levels far less time consuming
Yes yes yes :D
Чооооо
❤️Robtop top👍
2.2 top
тун тун тун
Can i get moderator in 2.2
I'm very hyped for 2.2 but, I'm just worried about the new bugs, abuse, recent levels getting worse, and other things. But on the other side, I feel like it will be more beneficial to creators too so that's going to lead to new masterpieces! 0w0
in 2.2 i also want advy to be OUT

Remember when gd is just a block obstacle game? Now it's a full game engine. Feel old yet?
:v
Can you just release the damn update already?
Where’s sneak peak 2.2??
I could use this in so many ways :)
AYO SNEAK PEAK 2 IS NEAR BECAUSE ROBTOP UPLOADED THIS
If i could only install the game for free 😅
I always thought of this as a way to make objects move in certain ways without using multiple move triggers, this is brilliant.
RobTop специально build не показывал?
Was this sneak peek 2?
THIS IS AMAZING!!!😀
This is cool and all, but why are you making new stuff in 2.2 again. Save it for 2.3 please, we don’t really care about these new additions if we can’t use them in the first place.
Improved animation
Hahahaha Great 👍
WHAT
When a quarter of your channel have become a storage for all the sneak peeks
GOOOOOOOOOO!!!
When 2.2
This is still be worked on? lol
Где обновления блять 😠
Would you like to hear some good news? This is the best news you'll hear. Everyone, including you and me, has sinned and falls short of God's glory (Romans 3:23). And because the wages/punishment of sin is death (Romans 6:23), you are headed for Hell for eternity. But because God loves you, He graciously offers you the gift of Eternal Life through Jesus Christ. Jesus, as God in the flesh, died for your sins on the cross. He took the punishment you deserve, and He rose again on the 3rd day. If you believe this and confess that Christ is Lord, then you are saved (Romans 10:9,10),  and regardless of what you may have done, there is no condemnation for you if you are in Christ Jesus (Romans 8:1). You are saved by what Jesus did on the cross, not what you do. Salvation is simple and free. "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life."
When 2.2? Im Neuropero, WHEN 2.2?
*ME WANTS!*
Wow this game has come a long way. It’s almost not even GD anymore haha.

2.2 beautiful
Me encanta loco guau
2.2 is gonna be revolution
Free creator points is about to begin in 2.2
Begin log: The year is 2259, Robtop has released another sneak peak video for the upcoming Geometry Dash update 2.2, it was so *sterky. I hope it won't be too long before the update comes out. The United States of Russia and the Canadian Republic of Japan have severed their meteorite trade with the Mexican empire, this may hinder the power production from the eastern seaboard's banana radiation plants. If there isn't enough power for all of our electric appliances, cars, and pets, then the prices for power units might go up and I won't be able to afford enough for my tablet to update Geometry Dash. Hopefully Robtop updates soon.  End log.  *sterky: a slang term meaning "cool" but also "long awaited". Orignated from the last words of Betty White's preserved brain back in 2245. Dripsters use it alot.
Me : litterally dreaming 2.2 was here  *10 min later* me : wake up   Also me : NOOOOO ITS JUST A DRREAAAM :::::((((( (Also its real)
Duh but ¡Amazing!
is this sneak peek 2
When tho

LETS GOOOO AT LAST
hello and I'm playing with cheats, and I realized that I lost, but just reinstalling the game is not enough, since there is my progress with the passed impossible demons (slaughterhouse) and I can’t create a new account either, because there is my level which I’ve been doing for 2 days already, please can delete my progress on my account, but leave my levels in the editor😫 Nickname:SozaQ

OMG COOLLL
Oh my gosh, I thought what 2.2 version new features has over... BUT HERE APPEARS TWO MORE
The first robtop upload ive seen after subbing and only 9 hours after.
Nice
WHEN IS 2.2 ROB?
Hurray! THE VIDEO HAS FINALLY COME OUT! After watching the video, I realized that version 2.2 is still being prepared. And everyone has been waiting for this update for 5 years! This is an incredible number of days! About the video: In this video we were shown that in version 2.2 there will be an animation trigger! This trigger is almost the same as the MOVE trigger! With the help of the animation trigger, you can move blocks, spikes and much more! They can also be moved in different ways, for example: by the movement of waves. Thank you so much for creating this game!!! GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR NEXT PROJECTS!!!
SNEAKY PEAK
Hey geometry dash creators....Why are the levels of the game so hard to pass? Does it need to be perfect timing so I won't die in the spikes?
you announced the trailer one year ago
2.2 will be...
Oooooooooo new feature???? Thisl speed up some things i have
Maybe it will help my stupid movement! I did not do very well with decoration hmm
Wow
Is that the elephant from "achievement unlocked"?
No 2.2 sneak peak? 😧
Awesome new feature, but I think it would be nice to be able to change the animation UI from this to the UI, similar to After Effects or other programs
Bruh
#9 on trending?
Why in mobile is not working 2.2?
This is about to be awesome; looks like the Cooler Move Trigger.

OMG one video robtop proved to me that 2.2 will be chic before this video I was skeptical about 2.2 but this feature will be very convenient useful and in general robtop is a legend.
Animation trigger used to be useless, but now its gonna be INSANELY useful in bossfight levels and animation levels!

Va a ser histórico tener esta actualización algún día
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
As an effect creator this is so helpful
Simplemente hermoso
holy hell that’s awesome
This fixes the problem with moving objects being tedious
Finnaly i can make animation without that move thing even i need to wait 1 year --
2.2 it's real
Spu7nix will have A LOT of work to do LMAO. His SPWN language will need a big update after this release, we'll need some volunteers
Imagine they actually release the update... Seems impossible for that to happen...
2.2 pls
😎👍
This should come out next monf
ANOTHER GD POST!!!
Pov: animators I will abandon the move trigger for this
Yoo :O
HOW ARE THE COMMENTS SO FULL ALREADY???
Geometry dash is slowly but surely becoming a game engine of its own :P Wonder how the new generation of "games inside GD" is going to be like...
Rubrub perceives time differently
Imagine if robtop actually responded to this comment
Finally another video
2.2 is coming... 👀
A la verg4 500 fps
2.2 seems to be more of an editor update which would lead to some insane levels being made. Hopefully the update releases
when 2.2
THIS WILL BE EVEN MORE EASY TO ANIMATE
:00000
wow
What
This is some juicy stuff can’t wait to use 2.2 editor to make some fantastic levels
Holy- THIS IS GOING TO BE SO USEFUL FOR A LEVEL IM MAKING
tu abuela
i'am losing my"confidence" because I am playing in "poco x3 " phone gyro good but I have no wifi . 😩 I had skills like DAD GAMER but no one support me

When?
OMG THIS IS A HUGE GAME CHANGER FOR CREATORS ROB good job!

Can't wait to use it after 10 years
Imagine having the audacity to upload a video. This isnt Robtop this is a faker! Robtop knows better than to upload on his channel
Oh My GOD FINALLY ANOTHER SNEAK PEEK :))))
omg dude what the hell, i thought that this was already dead lmaooo
WOW
I once thought it would be so cool when you can use bezier curves in move, rotate and scale triggers. But Robtop really took it a step further.
Hi
AKFIFWDHDHDHSHAHJXJFSHJDJXJSJAJDHDJSHFJDJSJSJDJFJDSJJSJDJDJDJDJDJSJFBDJWDJEJDJDJWJFJFJS

XDDDDDDD
Bro I CANNOT wait for 1 the second sneak peak but especially the actual update 2.2. RobTop you are actually awesome
This will open up so many cool posibilities for future creators, can’t wait to see it
This is just amazing. It will allow to optimize animations in minigames a lot!
Will you hurry?!
Glad to say I can actually be a tad early to a Robert video. I'm proud.

Damn those look awesome I can’t even imagine all the uses for this
Robert releases 2.2!
Wiw

Finally, he uploaded
Can't wait to see Sneak Peek 2!
THIS IS THE REVOLUTION!
Woah! Cool.
God damn I hope you optimise all of this
I swear, if I see a level that is using the animate trigger used inappropriately...
cool
omg

OMGGG
rob top OMG I BIG FAN!!!
This is incredible. Levels will have SO MUCH MORE movement!
Nice, but where is the release date?
Animators: Interesting

VERY COOL
Cool...but realease it!
Oh my God... imagine what would happen if this was in the hands of someone like amoraltra or xendergame 🍿
This will make editing WAY easier
Ayo rob #13 on trending let's go
Porque son todos los comentarios en inglés
Wow
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH I CANT WAIT TO BUILD WITH THIS
This makes it so easy for new players to move things, I did not know I needed this until now!

The way you used kevin macleod music makes it perfect
Juro que lo de animated groups era lo que pensaba de la forma de usar el trigger animatipn xD
Wow robtop you do the pretty awesome job
This ganna be epic
"Я больше не буду добавлять ничего нового в 2.2" говорил нам Роб
Whoooaaa
Wow its good but maybe early 2.2 will be bad

Y la Sneak Peek?
This is amazing
OH MY GOD, IT'S HAPPENING
Bro………. Just……. Release…… nvm

AAAAAAAAAAAAAA OMG
WOWOWOWOWOWOW ! How practical it will beeeeee !!!!
damn
2.2 is bad
Lets GOOO he uploaded again!!!
Wow
OMG NEW VIDEO OF ROBTOP!!!!!!!
I still don't have 200 diamonds ×_×
This is way easier than using move triggers.
1 year = new video
Nice!
when sneak peak 2 @RobTopGames
ah cool
Omg
:O
2025 :D
гг я ливаю тима раков !!!!
wow 2.2
Epic
im so glad i caught this
It's a nice feature, but why? Why don't you post new updates cut one by one, instead of one giant update which will bring Geometry Dash a lot of weird stuff, completely ending new creativity for a newer one? Why making the community wait for so long? I'm ONE HUNDRED percent sure 2.2 will arrive with atleast 10 different bugs, which will take atleast 5 months to get rid of. Why making such a huge update for more than 5 years, and making people wait even more knowing you are still not done with 2.2?  For you guys: Multiplayer is not a reality, 2.2 will be messy, and 2.2 will completely change the mechanics of the game, turning Geometry Dash into pure chaos (that's if 2.2 will even come out, because I don't think it will)
Gd isn’t working on iOS 15.
woah big beautiful update i can't wait this update
ROBTOP UPLOADED
I'm not creative enough at all to be able to use everything in 2.2 but I'm definitely excited for the kinds of levels we're going to be seeing from others
How que buena animación ropa top👏
Yes no meibi aronou yu can repit tha kueshtion
Nothing beats the feeling of seeing a new robtop video… Now, I have high hopes for 2.2!
Full Release soon after Sneak Peek 2?
I want to play GD 2.2 now!
Пфф, я тоже так могу
Making bossfights is now easier!!
NO WAY IVE BEEN WANTING THIS SINCE 2.1
Cuánto falta para 2.2
Heloo
Cant wait
FİNNALY
Damn, that so smooth
This might be one of the best additions to 2.2. Amazing!
When is released? It been many year
This is REALLY cool and will make animation and movement 10 TIMES easier!! Thanks, Rob!!!!!!!!!
WOW
YOOOOO
Is geometry dash editor becoming an animating software?
10,265th
Damn that’s crazy bro, but-
Now the real question...    *2.2 when???*
wtf new video!!!
fix GEODASH for IOS pls
This will make creating projectiles and bosses so much easier.
Nice Glad to know my sons will be able to experience this in like 20 years
Ive waited 6 years for amogus skin pls add It im still waiting
That looks cool! Can't wait for 2030
Release it already.
Hmmmm
THE MAN THE LEGEND HE HAS RETURNED WITH MORE EXITING editor stuff
Date For 2.2?
This will change america
HOLY SHIT WHEN I SAW THE BLUE DOT MY JAW DROPPED!!!!
Will 2.2 even come?
Bruxd
chido 🖒
What????? 2.2???
Shocked me when I first saw this vid lol, Thanks for Sharing!
No robtop, we wanted the sneek peek
can i have money
when is 2.2
Saca la 2.2 ya pa por favor
Another video from the legend
Сука хитрец на робтопычах как будто комменты купил. Всё так счастливы, сколько фич появляется, и никого не волнует, что их с каждым годом все больше, и он почему то не может их добавлять постепенно и заставляет игроков терпеть и ждать
finally... I have in my lvl (layout) 455 move triggers (34 sec)
¡¡¡SACA LA 2.2!!!
Ya acabala porfa
La 2.2 está muy cerca que emoción
Press start is back
Yes.
Wait wot
GD is now going to be movie editor... Nice
I'm starting to think he used this in press start
WE'RE ARE  THE 2.2,IM WAIT IT SOOOOO MUCH TIME
Dios mío que tanto porque no puede salir y yaa
The skull is pretty cool, YoRied is gonna take advantage of that...
As an animator and video editor I must say this guy is crazy. He's literally designing a really complex sistem of editing. Now I understand why this took way THAT long!!
Looks like GD platformer mode is becoming SMM2
And now we wait another year for another video 😎
WHEN WHEN WHEN?!?!
а у меня аккаунт слетел до нуля, к чёрту дальнейшую игру
New icon elefant
ae
feature almost similar to Adobe Animate xD
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
After long year are they gonna pull the update next year?
Wow I love this sneak peek
Ay
what about level routing? since 2.2 can make the cube move backwards, then the percentage and the bar goes down, it would only makes sense if the bar still goes on, just like subzero.
Tu sigue así, que nadie recordará el juego que tanto nos hizo felices
this is amazing
OMGGGGGG
Hope 2.2 Comes On December :)
Animation time!
esto es genial, me imagino lo que se puede hacer con estas nuevas funciones para el editor :D
En serio un año de espera y nos encontramos un video épico de nuevas animaciones
So long since you posted something 😢
Gosh that's actually useful for making transitions
Damn bro this is cool
This looks so good i can't imagine how will look like The futur levels
Well, time to wait for a year and a half.
very cool
Hi omg
Many GD : When 2.2? RobTob : this video
Esta actualizacion 2.2 sera una locura!!
FINALL!!
Cant wait to see the animations people make with this
W
*sad move trigger noises*
Are you going to fix geometry dash on iOS?
Ayy les goo
HOLY THIS IS HUGE
Wow
we all heared that gd will be used to pirate whole movies in the future
Cool
2.2 Will be so awesome! If rubrub will release it someday
I am really glad that my grandkids will use this feature
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Ooooh nuevo video de Robtop
this is still GD?
Geometry dash is still a thing? Loved it but the amount of content is just a disappointment. He is adding and adding  and is losing a lot of players (probably, i didnt check the daily visits of the game). I am just disappointed from you Rob. Sorry :/
I'm a lot more hyped now
can't believe it's been a year since the last sneak peak at 2.2 it really feels like yesterday
Hala  Epic
For the love of god we dont need this many features
poggggg
OK
looks dope
gamer
Ideas de robtop para la sneap peek 2   2.2 de geometry dash :) estoy sorprendido por los efectos de seguimientis de flechas :D
When 2.2 sp
como se piratea??????(es broma)
Finally i can make anime in Geometry Dash
I can feel al The gd community on their way to create new 2.2 levels
Help im stuck in 2.11 ¿what do i do?
honestly, rename the 2.2 update to Geometry Dash 2. that is literally what it is. a sequel to geometry dash.
cuando la 2.2
2.2 may indeed be revolution
Honestly I am happy with this. I thought this was the sneek peek and I wasn’t even sad this is insane. Levels are going to be amazing with. Don’t feel to pressured to publish it when unfinished. We love you Robtop. I loo ok be you Robtop. 💙❤️💙❤️
This is cool
Whoa im early
nice
Now we actually can't wait for 2.2 to come out.
Next trailer in 2023 🤌🏼😂😪😪
Para que emocionarme si se que no la va a sacar 🫠
Epic
I'm not a creator, but I gotta admit that this is awesome. 2.2 is around the corner, I can feel it.
2.2 Looks So Cool! I might make a rate worthy level when it’s out with all the cool features!
HELL YEAH! I’m so excited for 2.2!!
omfg
God damn it RobRob, just release the update as is and update it progressively afterwards
Woah 😳
ok
0)
1 of my hardest time when try making some effects are smooth moving objects. This really helps a lot
Я жду... Я жду...
i like that
At this point GD can probably be classified as animation software  Any screencapture software does the exporting
Wenomechainsama
Ooooooooh 2.2
IM SO EXITED LOL
Esa música Rob por dios 🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑
😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
2.2 is gonna be more than revolutionary. Every streamer will be playing it just like everyone played fortnite TRUST calling it rn
Also you can do it finish what you started! Go rob
0:28 Skull from press start
Q bien, ahora a esperar otros 2 años...
Genial mecánica para hacer niveles con boss 😮
gg's bois we have removed the purpose of, move, scale and rotate triggers (even though the rotate trigger and this come in the same update lol)
Прикольно
This'll heavily reduce object count for current animation methods I think
So good
Oh no more troll levels😟
Legal mas e a 2.2 ?
Cant wait for the update
I can smell them errors🗿
Nice
This video released on my birthday, great timing rob!
Epic
THIS IS AWESOME! i cant wait for 2.2
Whoa

Para cuándo la 2.3?
Yay
YOOOO!

Looks like bossfights and other moving obstacle courses are gonna be even more badasser (and of course it seems gonna be more difficult .-.)
LOL 2.2
real
Ohhh nuevo mecanismo que bien rob
∆∆∆
Cool very Cool
Yes! I can finally use my animation skills for this!
amazing
This is great but I feel like we still have to rely on move triggers for blocks
This will render toggle triggers a little bit less usful
Where the sneak peek 2? 🤡
Wtf robtop
Saque la 2.2 robtop pls
Woo
Really hope the update comes out soon, I don’t know if anyone is having the same problem as me but I’m on IPhone 8 and every time I start up the game it keeps kicking me out
Adobe animate update looking good

When is 2.2 mr robert
Sonic wave, but spike
I love this trigger
it will be more interesting than those
That's super cool I love it
:)
I wasn't building in GD for like half a year, but even I can see how cool this feature is. 2.2 is gonna be very nice!
I hope it can be played in another life, because in this one I am not enough...
2.2 = revolution
I'll finally have a reason to do a better level...
2.2 looks so awesome I hop my grandkids can appreciate its release like I would’ve when it releases
Waiting form 2017!!
OMG AND U DOING EVERYTHING ALONE??? SUCH A GENIUS
It seems to me an extremely stupid idea, for such nonsense that this game is delayed more than 5 years.
Yes very cool but we all wanted the sneak peak :c
La song es una referencia a Fernanfloo 😱😱
Bruh I don’t think this is coming out lol
So geometry dash is After effects the game
Que guay!!
SO READY FOR 2.2 your doing great rob much love and support
This is such a cool and fun feature
Wow a new feature
so it still alive :D
MORE 2.2 VIDEOS
Gooooooood
goddamn robtop you make unexpected features again
I just can't wait for 2.2! You are doing amazing Robtop
It's so surreal how the GD editor could be a level editor, video editor, and a programming language, all at the same time.
* He sits down to wait for the sneak peek 2 *
So nice
I just love how RobTop casually posts these teasers for 2.2 meanwhile the people who left the community still believe it’s dead. It’s like coming in saying “Don’t worry I’m still here.” Love you Rubrub, keep it up
Geotry dash
Xender game after watching this
La espero con ansias (la 2.2)
OH MY ACTUAL GO-
no way roptop uploaded
2.2 is probably going to be the best and most detailed update so far in the history of gd (very likely actualy..)
If you go and put the newest comments in this video, you will find young people being impatient and saying stuff like COOL BUT RELEASE SNEAK PEEK NOW I hate it
Con esto no esta ca saqueando? XD
Do you adding the choice to play with controller on ios?
I think For a sneak peek like the last year but si no bad
OH BOY I CANT WAIT FOR 2.2, seriously i cant even wait for the 2.2
Por fin!! Ya hay mas esperanzas de  que salga la 2.2 en este año ;V
Bruh this will be a life/time saver! Keep up the good work!
i bought gd in steam and google play store, i have more rights to demand 2.2
Good feature but would be better if it actually came out one day...
Robtop, you are amazing!!!
What the hell?
This feels like such a Geometry Dash way to make an animation feature, simple but incredibly versatile
wowowowwowow another sneak peek buaahahahahahaa so it means the release of 2.2 is near
This isn't a sneak peek >:(
wow 10kth comment
Wow I have been playing GD for 1 year and I still can not figure out how to use the editor.   :(
This is so ridiculous.. it’s not even a new game and were all still waiting being hyped
Epic
at this point were just stuffing the 2.2 editor with features to the point where a regular player wont be able to use it whatsoever. sure, this might be cool for the professional creators who are willing to spend 100 hours mastering a single feature, but mark my words, 2.2 will kill the casual side of geometry dash, and practically cut off the stream of new players coming in, as it will be the least newcomer friendly update, and will drive people away from the game.
AND... The sneak peek?
SACALA YAAAAA AHFKDOABFJ
Guapardisimo tío la nueva sneek peak
Coming soon... 2.2
5 years for an update I know it's difficult because robtop works alone but it's already a long time xd
Ok dead cube game
oh my god I am going to abuse the camera and these animation things! 😁
When  is 2.2 sneek peak 2 coming
Wake up babe, robtop just uploaded his yearly 30 second video
This feature is so cool!
dear god please let me play 2.2 really soon
2.2 will be the most fun and liked update ever from the game
Dead
Why no sneek peek
fix the game on ios
Its 1 uptade in geometry dash! Stars will now be easier to get!
This feature looks cool. I really like how it was executed, and creators wi find a way to take this feature to it's limits. I'm so hyped. Can't wait to get 2.2 in my retirement home!
научите меня выкладывать Одно 30 сек видео в год и набрать 10кк сабов
As a Modern Creator. i would love to use this for Small Animations to make my levels more lively without using to many objects! :]
:O                                        Can’t wait for 2.2

I didn't expect this, this is crazy imagine the bossfigts It will be crazy and the levels of 2.2 :D
The recent tab is gonna be an absolute mess

epic game epic audience
seriously robtop :(
This could've waited for 2.3...
New font?
looks useful, can't wait!
wonder if the game will need more than 1-2 gb to download and install and the sys req would be different
(:
Wow making trolls will be easier .,.
Robtops posts are sacred
This looks so sick, and i can already see millions of diffrent ideas with this, actually such a nice feature to have as well

Looks like it's gonna not take years to learn 2.2 editor
Where's Sneaky?)
Why you post the second I get of my phone?
Yes!
Que mierda es esto robtop
famila, hoy se come 🐔
I don't mean to sound ungreatful, this is amazing, but will the free mobile versions get an update? I'm broke as hell and finished all the free games
Roptop never stops adding new features. Is that a good thing or a bad thing? Who knows anymore
2.2 is just GD 2 at this point there's so much being added
I'm calling it now. That skull at the end is being used in the 2.2 main level.
Oohh This is going to be beautiful
Lol the levels Will become insanes
2.2 will never come out...
adobe animate trigger (real)
I can already imagine myself being in the editor and not knowing how to do anything
New 2.2 update is awesome.
Is better than nothing.
Geometry dashes annual upload
I can't wait for this update, and finally be able to make an omelet with my pc
Can't wait for 2nd sneak peek and 2.2!
Pinche robtop quería la sneak peek 😭
Don't you like it when comments get more likes than replies? Btw this video is really cool!
When is 2.2 coming I don't have twitter
Now im even more hyped for the 2nd sneak peak let alone 2.2!!
Oh yes a teaser! *11 years later* Another teaser?
:0
This is going to be amazing, but i think you just removed the use for move, rotate, and scale triggers
Heres to another year of waiting 🥂   Can’t wait for 2.2 man!
poor mobile players…
Mmm It was worth the wait
It's very ccol !
Super duper cool :O
An actual editor thing, wow

Does gd not work for Anyone since iOS 15?
O_O
'О'
YOOOOOOO THIS IS SICK
coming soon..
Who
This looks so promising! Finally I can animate things without a move trigger, toggle trigger, and a gazillion more triggers
the editor is gonna go crazy in 2.2 holy
This is straight up how I though move triggers worked before I got the full version.
Kinda cool
How I can play the 2.2 I take the version of pay

Por favor ya no me ilusiones más :cc
Ohmaingod!

Now i can animate bossfights more smoother!
We're going to have actual movies in 2.2 holy shit
this the 10 million subscriber special
Reminds me of replay mod in Minecraft.
That gonna be soo AWESOME !!!
Omg this is what I imagined the move trigger would look like, but 9 year old me was bummed how difficult they were to use. This will be huge for getting new creators in!
Physics in objects and custom objects when?
Eso fue todo???
Увидимся через год!
This man really adds everything in 2.2, so nothing will be added in 2.3👌👌👌
Y la sneak peek
Imagine this is the new sneak peek
yooooo sicckk
in the end it was not the sneak peek of explorers but FENCE! ;D
cool
Omg This Is So Cool!!!
Well this looks epic, can't wait to play around with it
Tengo 54 años y he esperado por esta actualización, veo los sneak peeks para sentir lo que no pude hacer
Esta cada vez más cerca :D

This one of the first things im gonna try to learn in the 2.2
45k views and 46k likes
THAT'S INSANE
Wow
Yay robtop after a eternity posted a video!
My grandsons will play the shit out of this update..
:O
the old animations of 2.1 are no more
LOL Guitar: hoy se come

I am going to have a blast with this feature and I can't wait to see what other creators make with this. Great job toprob
This looks so cool!
que cómodo se ve la 2.2!
dude the keyframe system literally makes move and rotate triggers look like trash
I didn’t know that Geometry Dash would become an animation software
Ok, my phone says 45k views and 46k likes. Something ain't adding up here. Anyways, can't wait for the sneak peek!
I can tell that 2.2 is going to be a HUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGE UPDATE!
rockruck games
nice
YEEEES this is always how i wanted the move trigger to work
Ooooo
robtop upload
Lo esperamos con ancias
Amazing!
Happy 10M!!!!
best update
soooo cooooool!!!
Now i can build a cool bossfight
and yall wonder why its taking so long
Now it's easy to use animations!!!
2.2 when
This will be great for people who do not know how to use the editor (like me)
This is probably the single greatest addition of 2.2... seriously this is HUGE
Nice! :D
Rob saw 3Dash’s editor and was a little envious lol
Very nice add
Looks nice ngl..
Move trigers are pretty much over 😢 but this seems better!
LETS GO ROBTOP
FINALLY
AYOOOOO
thats the best u can show us in 6 years....
You should add statistics for levels. like total play time and most common places to die. also, will we be able to play the game like currently? where we dont have to hold arrow keys to move?
finally we have news for the 2.2 version ! It's been about 4 years now...
I actually wanted this to be in gd but i would have never expected it to actually happen!
Finally we dont have to use 10 move triggers to animate 1 spike
Bro, we literally gave up on playing because of so much waiting.
Finally a reason to actually use the Animate trigger
Когда 2.2?
This was the sneak peak 2.2?
aleiz14 sigue esperando
Just fucking release already holy shit
woah
Nah, de locos
I hope that the update arrives later this year, and that there are several main levels
круто, куча новых фич, можно сказать другая совсем игра.... но.... зачем столько контента, которого больше чем во всей игре, в одном обновлении? почти все уже наигрались за это время в 2.2 и особого восторга от нововведений не будет (за исключением радости от того что спустя пять лет оно все-таки вышло)
Creators have made other games within GD, but when this new update comes, its gonna be like your Isekai'd to a better world.
No more move trigger!
Ахуеть
9,616th
I Can't wait to play geometry dash 2.2 with my Grandchildrens
Aja y eso para que servirá?
The new era of recent levels is gonna be worse than hell itself.
Mmmmm jajaja, esperamos tanto para esto?
Yes, this is all fine, but I want 2.2 already, but there is still no approximate date.
Robtop, when will 2.2 be out it’s been 4 years?
Quedé,3stup1d0 .__. t3 0d10

2.2 is 2023??
cant wait for 2.2, oh boy
How will this affect Lebron's legacy
Holy fuck this is much better than the traditional move triggers
The games file size is gonna double at this point lmao
The move trigger:  panic*
And the sneak peek?
Nice, Serponge will finally be able to make Cyberpunk 2077 in GD next update
HOSTIAAAAAAAAAAA
I think this is the best trigger in the whole universe of geometry dash --- Мне кажется это самый лучший триггер во всей вселенной геометри даш
Ya casi me imagino como seran los niveles de la 2.2 :0
I was here
Ok so when is this gonna come out 2024
Wow

Who was gonna unsubscribe to robtop games before reading the videos description?
Lmao R.I.P. move trigger
:0
Hola wenas
These 2.2 functions will replace all the millions of triggers in maps, so they will be more optimized  Well, GD doesn't seem to be very demanding, but anyway there are good news for players with old laptops, phones etc.
I hope it's worth waiting another month to see Explorers' sneek peak :°
we’ve been in 2.1 for 5 years and theres still stuff happening in the community before the update, I still can’t fathom the amount of new posibilities we’re gonna have with 2.2..
This will be great for bossfights! I can imagine some wacky stuff being done with this system.
this will make our lives so so SO much easier
Good Job zhenmuron. I cant wait
WOW

Imagine crating your monster like bat or beast
2.2 Looks Awesome
Oh man that’s amazing
МНЕ КАЖЕТЬСЯ ЧТО У НЕГО ЕСТЬ НЕ КОТОРОЕ ОТСУТСТВИЕ УМСТВЕННОЙ БАЗЫ. СКОРЕЕ ВСЕГО ОН  ПАРАЛЕЛЬНО РАЗРАБАТЫВАЕТ И ПАРАЛЕЛЬНО УЗНАЁТ НОВЫЕ МАТИМАТИЧЕСКИЕ ЗАКОНОМЕРНОСТИ ЧТОБЫ СОЗДАТЬ ТОЙ ИЛИ ИНОЙ ПРОЦЕС. ТАК КАК  НЕ ДОСТАТОЧНО МОЗГОВОЙ АКТИВНОСТИ ПОСЛЕ ВЫХОДА ИЗ ВНЗ/ВУЗ, А ТЕМБОЛИЕ РАБОТА И СОЗДАНИЕ ПОСЛЕ РАБОТЫ ИГРЫ, ТУТ НУЖНО ВСЁ ВРЕМЯ ЧТОТО УЗНАВАТЬ.   Ну к примеру:  Разработать рабочее приложение, которое будет сортиторовать чтото за алфавитным порядком за наименьшее количество ходов.  Или например: Создайте свой калькулятор.  Или вот еще: Сделайте програму/фикс который будет достравивать отсутствующую область картинки по пикселям, допустим будет ограниченое количество пикселей на 1 площадь, к примеру 100. (без использований нейросетей). Вот насколько это сложно..... Всё строиться на математической структуре
Imagine how levels would look like in 2.2
2.2???
Yo that's sick
I am so excited for 2.2
NO MAMES
Thank you youtube, 12k views and 44k likes

You know those animations which are typically Auto-Rated? Imagine how those will be seriously taken up a level in 2.2 with this..
Adobe geometry Dash
wow robtop
muy rico y todo pero y la 2.2?
As far as I remember, in September or something like that they were going to start deleting the applications from the play store that hadn't been updated for a long time, I don't know if Robtop takes that into account xd
1h = 8 k comments lol
This is so cool!!!
OMG i need THIS update
LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

Were is sneak peek?
nice!! gj Rob...i thought that you forgot ab your game but i was flase...gj rob...gj*)*(*
Just release 2.2
It's good that the Geometry Dash lives and then everyone thinks that there will be no update, but I believe! I believe that it will all be!  The game is being developed for a long time because there may be bugs and you check them carefully and fix them! Thank you for making the game! P.S. the text may be unclear because I am Russian.
Looks inspired by 3dash
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO ROBTOP'S VIDEO IS BACK!!!!
Its a good day when RobTop uploads a 2.2 related video
:D
This update will improve auto levels
Boss fights are gonna become easier to make
Omg gd x jsab idea

БОЖЕ ЭТО ГЕНИАЛЬНО
This is going to save hundreds of objects, groups, and hours in the editor. Good job, Rob!  But please find a stopping point to this update and release it! You can always resume adding more features in updates to come.

roperop released a new deckpeck
Hago convocatoria para hacer un undertale en geometry dash
Ok now give us an actual level sneak peak
bruh i played gd when i was like 9 and look how far we have come!
Like Blender
The 2.2 editor is going to have so many tools that builders aren't going to know what to do with them. Some levels will be amazing once builders figure out how to take full advantage of the new tools at their disposal.
Jeje
BRUH some comments were deleted,  it was 9024, but now it is 8724🙄🤔
epic
Bruh when 2.1 released i was in 5th grade. Now I’m in High school 11th Grade, I can’t wait for this

Geometry Dash is turning into a game engine and this is fantastic.
How exiting
Wait… the 2.2 come in short time?
Роб раз в год вспоминает пароль от канала 🫠
WOW
Esto es muy importante para crear niveles epicos

Holy crap! I’ve been waiting for this video! 2.2 is going to be the best gd update yet!
This makes move triggers look primitive now
You Should Add The Ability to rotate blocks
You already dint even make 2.2 your ideas flow like a man getting a girlfriend

34k likes and 4k visits is very epic xd
robtop never pinned this comment....
2.2 isn't going to ever come out.
I don't think he should call this 2.2 anymore, because of the long time and the many features being added, I think it is time to call this 3.0.
0.o
YEY A 2.2 SNEAK PEAK
When
Hay caray eso si me interesa🙀😀
the sneak peak???? Robtop??
Drop utopía
Давай реще выпускай 2.2
are we going to be allowed to customize the speed of each point
are u sure this is not a game engine
Y la 2.2 para cuando 😢
Yes! A tutorial on the editor by RobTop himself :D Can't wait for 2.2
when 2.2
Great!  A new trailer, and the update?
Ö
This is going to be the best update. Ever.
Reconozco q va a ver niveles increíbles, pero habra gent que lo haga tan bien como los creadores de los niveles con rate, (tratando d NO ofender a esas personas sin niveles rateados) buen trabajo rob ;)<3.  I know that there are people that will do incredible levels but there are people whose works are not that good (trying to NOT offend them) great job rob ;)<3
I can’t even begin to explain how hyped I am. I’ll be heading through the recent tab for hours on end just playing insane stuff. I love you RobTop
Elephant icon?!
I WANT 2.2 ALREADY AHHHHH!!!!!
Will Rob fix the ios 15 issue ):
no way robtop hitting us with the 2.2 leak?
Alot of people liked it and watched this video that the  viewer count broke
я гей но никто об этом не узнает так как тут слишком много комментариев
Tremble animation programs
i think Spu7nix just nutted
Ya saca la 2.2 roptop
Actually can’t wait
Oh its so exiting
Omg
Ayo we all waiting
Good Job Roptop👍
Épic trigger
F
Does that it mean it will be way easier to create boss battles for example?
when 2.2 comes out, you said more in 6 months or at the end of summer
Cant wait for 2.2
This update is so cool
COOOL i can make skull anim so i can kill the player better if they mess up.
Just curious Robtop, what is there in 2.2 that still needs fixing? If there isnt anything, then why not just upload 2.2 instead of another sneak peek? Im starting to think it might be sneak peek 1 all over again
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Robtop cuanto tiempo sin ver un nuevo video tuyo espero que pronto salga la 2.2 que ya hemos esperedaro demasiado tiempo
It is so close
All epic 2.1 levels will now be just rated💀
Вы ещё тут...
Update 2.2 is progress wow!
FINALLY
Cool
Bruh at this point the GD editor is just it's own game engine, I have never seen anything more complex, maybe besides Bethesda's extremely outdated and overwhelmingly overcomplicated Creation Kit
Are you gonna update subzero again to add these or not?
Ooooh
So this is why 2.2 is taking half a decade
new video=upteide 2.2
Amazing!!!
Wow its good!
I LIKE IT BUT I CAN WAIT FOR 2.2 HOW YOU HAVE THE REAL.
Damn!
Very unexpected
This might be one of the best additions to 2.2. Amazing!
:0 lemonz is gonna slap at this... or did he quit geometry dash i dont remember. Been too long.
me da miedo y emoción que el juego cambie bastante el contenido en una sola actualización
Lol finally after 6 years 2.2 is coming out soon
Esa canción me recuerda a fernanfloo 😔👍
Yeeees
I waited 1 year for a new video and finally
.
Por lo que veo la 2.2 será la actualización más grande que a tenido
when the animate trigger is useful
This will be so useful in 2.2!
Post the game now
WHY ARE ALL THESE THINGS “NEW” stop adding new stuff holy shit 💀💀💀💀
This update just keeps giving
5 years, but 2.2 is the NEW revolution!
Amazing!
Optimization will be insane!
OMG

We need this update!!!
earlyy
Дааааааааа
Se que esto se ve muy prometedor y tambien veo que a pensado mucho a la comunidad, osea los niveles ya que todos supongo que quieren hacer algo mas y no la tienen, entonces el robtop lo hace.  Eres un capo robtop ;)
epik

Si que sera una actualización muy divertida
Any more thing we need to know
potboR,looc si siht dna hsad ytremoeg ekil I
Out on april 1st
Me like it
We've been wrong this whole time... The thing we call the "player" the thing we try to stop from death, the very thing we sought to protect was the villain all along. It's mission was not avoiding death, but instead it's mission was to die. An explosion nearly powerful enough to tear through the very fabric of space-time. Thousands of years ago RubRub was entrusted with millions of universes, each with its unique buildings and monuments.  However evil forces sought to destroy every last one and take their power orbs until the only universe remaining was their own that they rule over. RubRub used all the energy in millions of orbs to create one defensive building per universe... The great wall... capable of turning any weapon back into the orbs it was crafted from. The evil forces built up an army of cube shaped bombs they attacked all at oncefrom behind one cube per world. The cube army was attacking from the opposite side RubRub expected and the great wall lay miles away in the distance. RubRub hacked and gained control of the cubes but he knew he couldn't stop them all. So he recruited you agreeing to reward you with orbs from the cubes you disarm. The closer you get the cubes to the great wall the weaker they become and the .ore orbs you get. So next time you load up geometry dash remember your not playing as a gamer but as a protector of worlds.
THAT IS INSANE
Hahaha among us

my only problem with 2.2 is that, with all these tools. imagine what it takes to get a level rated. and with the rate system of 2.1, its probably gonna be a issue. other than that, this update will be great

robtop, I want you to add another button for the platformer, with the help of which it will be possible to climb under the block
GD is becoming a game engine.

РобТоп 2 года назад: *_всё, больше никаких нововведений, только доработаю сник пик, и всё._*  РобТоп сегодня: *_выпускает новое видео с этим_* ☝🏿 *_содержанием._*                       😕
Fuck it's been a long time ROBTOP disappointed that the second sneak Peek hasn't come out

I remember the day 2.1 came out. It was awesome. I can’t even imagine what it will be like when 2.2 comes out!
Ok, this is so cool, but isn't 2.2 taking long enough to come out already???
Epico!👍
WHERE 2.2 UPDATE ROBTOP? HUH!?
2.2 will never come out Robtop only releases random content, about his ideas...
wow
I need It 😭😭
Ya déjate de mmdas y Saca ya la 2.2....
No me imagino el trabajo de tuvo que hacer rob para que esto sea posible. Este sistema está muy bueno. Hacer animaciones ahora será muy muy fácil ngl
Robert "RobTop" Topala, you are my favourite person atm.
Im scared of 2.2 ...
2.2 UPDATE SPOILER!?!!?! Ok
Im so happy finally
2.2 is going to change the way people make levels, i cant wait for all the creativity that can be done in this update! Cant wait

Can’t wait for 2.2 (6 years later)
ROBTOP GO 2.2
Finally 0_0
move trigger is dead
Kinda out of the blue
2.2 is going to be even better!
Mobile player: *dies*
Wow! The animate trigger actually has a real useful use
ayo
This looks awesome!
Bro, 2.2 just gets better by the second. First was zoom, static, and offset camera triggers. Then reversible orbs and pads. Then there was camera rotation and visual effects along with the ability to literally play vertical gameplay, and then there was custom enter and exit animations and even an auto build system. And then after that there was a new vehicle added, the swingcopter. And now there’s THIS, literally a custom animation trigger. GG RubRub, hope to see it come out this year 😁  Edit: I know that I didn’t say the features in the order they were announced, I’m just super excited and can’t really focus on the order 😅
Today The gaming lifes
Ur so cool do not hurry and 2.2 will be fantastic! 😁👌
That would be a legendary function.
La 2.2 tendrá que esperar cuando termine la segunda sneak peek yo creo que es explores creo

Now I don't want to sound ungrateful or anything, but I think Rob has made too many new things for 2.2  I'd rather see like 30% of what is promised, and other stuff to drop later. It just takes too much time
Asombroso!
We need the actualization. No more sneak peeks, stop dude WTF are u doing in this 4 years

OW SH-
2.2 comes with too many new things, I think it should be the 3.0 update, the way to name the version would be correct and it would also justify everything that took a little
This thing will make creating levels Extremely easier. Cannot wait for upcoming legendary bossfights
Keep up the good work Robtop

No era lo que esperaba, pero estoy satisfecho
Can't wait!
i actually dreamed of this last night
Can't wait for this to be released in the next decsde
Bro this is EXACTLY what I wanted! My animations are gonna go crazy!
finally i can create humans in gd
I hope this game becomes playable. I’m assuming it’s because of the new update which I forgot was happening.
but update your game nothing no Rub Rub? I'm getting bored
this is gonna be soo useful in the bossfights
Siempre decepcionando.....
Sick! Can we get the top comment of this video?!
Everyone: "I don't want to play with you anymore"  *Drops Move Trigger*
WHATTTTTT
I can't dominante actual triggers, and seeing Robtop's will add this triggers is just a blowmind
OMG SNEAK PEAMK
va
Ура
Refusing to believe that this is actually coming out :D
Geometry dash will just slowly evolve into a game engine.
Hopefully the wait is worth it
Art levels and bossfights are going to be on another level with this.
I already see it. This will be featured in XcreatorGoal`s new video
damn looks so fun. finally we get to use the animate trigger!
Wow

Stop adding more feature
épico
This looks so cool
2.2 has had some major development problems, but I don’t like anyone saying Rob is a lazy dev. This looks great.
oh this so cool just imagine auto levels with this feature i can't wait for 2.2!
I expect 2.2 levels to be some of the absolute best in the whole game
Christmas has come early this year! Bless RobTop!
Esto mejorará mucho los nuevos niveles de la 2.2 :)
Holy that is so good
powerpoint tbh
Y... Y ya??
O good
i was here
This is sick. 2.2 really looking like a golden age of GD.
how many things will you add? :O
This will be a game changer
JOE BUCKEN ROCKS! WE acended!!1
Ok robtop will sneak peek 2 will come tomorrow or in another week?    Edit:probably it’s coming 24 august or more
2.2 valdrá la pena por mucho tiempo:')
Wow, this actually looks like a user friendly tool, that is easy to learn how to use
I'm bad with level design
wow,this cool👍
A new video?! And it’s EPIC!!!
imagine an auto level creator with this feature
Next video: 3D graphics
AYO ROB UPLOAD POGGGGGGGGG
Uuuuu, que es eso
This will make moving objects a lot easier!  Really excited for 2.2 it’s looking like the biggest update ever!
Anime gd
Carajo al fin
Díganme que esto no es la tal “sneak peek”
2.2 will be the biggest update than all updates combined
2.2 is going to be sooo awesome, the possibilities are endless!!
Siuu
low detail mode 💀
I was there
Imagine Rob gives us the ability to have voice audio for our GD levels while animating the objects. This is really nice! I like that the arrows pointing represents the objects that are rotating in that direction of the arrow.
Finally the Animate Trigger has become more useful.
That is so cool holy shit
Ojo
This is very cool i like it that it makes stuff easier than before btw hyped for sneakpeak 2 😁
wow
Essa demora toda não me anima
Im scared about great creators using this
what
The possibilities of this and the amount of potential for creativity is exciting!
2.5 k view and 19k likes…. Makes sense
damn
Omg
It's so amazing to think that sometime in the future, this video will be nostalgic.
Super cool, so excited for 2.2 :D
Esto ya es como editar un video en cualquier editor de videos, esta mierda es una puta locura y hace más cómodo todo, ya no se qué pensar con el futuro de Geometry Dash con todas estas herramientas :0
NICE!
so random XD
damn so cool
This thing has so many posibilities :0
The future is near!
Actualizarlo deberías vrg
Estoy muy emocionado aaaa
I thought you stopped adding more stuff to 2.2. Or was this added before that statement? But I gotta say this looks really dope. So I wouldn’t mind if this was added after the statement.
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️👍👍👍👍👍
finally a worthy function for the animate trigger
Wow
5410th
All we made 1 by 1 in the 2.1 gets recked by 1 damn trigger i thing this sucks alot. it was about the limits. Because of the limits we all thought that the levels are amazing. but know you just say oh ok he used that trigger and that destroys mostly the hours of works. but its just my opinion its just helping peopel who started creating and thats a good thing so yeah idk 😕
NICE, it's so cool for animations in auto levels
THIS IS ROBTOP GAMES OFFICIAL!?
It would be amazing if we could draw our blocks in the way we want
I made this game
Un pequeño salto para los cubos un gran salto para la comunidad
Wait... WHAT

It will economize time as f*
This will make everything so much easier and 2.2 more worth the wait!
Volvio :D
2.2 is a revolución?
Aaaa mira, tremenda la rolita
Revolutionary omg the if you want your level rated in 2.2 you need to make a level that takes 6 months
nashe
O-O
gigachad
The bossfight potential is unreal
sick birthday present!!!!!
Love you, RubRub. ❤️
This can make for some interesting levels
Let's how long the comments stay active
Aja y eso que tiene que ver qué en México el kilo de tortillas este en 30$ PTM
As a creator I can't wait for 2.2 now xD

that looks amazing
Fiuuumba
Im one
Когда выйдет 2.2
Rob.. Where is sneak peek..? 😭😭
LA 2.2 SE ACERCA GENTEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Hey Rob. If you’re reading this, I’m really grateful that you created my childhood. I remember beating Stereo Madness and I was so excited that I told my 2nd grade teacher, and she actually thought Geometry Dash was a math game, good times. Take your time with 2.2, I’m no expert at programming but I assume it’s not easy. Keep up the great work.
Trolls levels be like:
Pretty sick! Do you think 2.2 will come out this year?
Wow interesante mecanica ya siento como se acerca la 2.2 ya no puedo esperarla :D
dam danial. Yup yup yup yup
Limits exist only for Rob to break them. I can't believe how further things will increase with lesser and more efficient toggles and mechanisms being used instead of heavy walls of triggers to recreate it.
Well random generation levels are going to be way worse
Wow
Alguien sabe el apk de la 2.2 que tiene Robtop ???
2.2 👍
When is it coming 😭😭😭😭
AIN'T NO WAY
Pen3
Yey! Animations!
very awesome
Time to enjoy some cool new 2.2 sneak peeks knowing full well it isn't coming until at least mid-2023
No puede ser :0.....
It's amazing 👏
hostia
gg
Mapache que porqueria Igual ta god
omg
Wonder what creators are going to do with this
the move trigger with fewer steps
Woah
Wait, you're gonna add something everyday, but not the update?
No hope for 2.2 ever releasing. Robtop is just unable to stop himself from adding features
I am half excited and half meh on it but it looks rlly good so far! Cant wait to see it!
:O
Cannot wait to see this implemented in levels
I can’t believe I’m this early to a robtop video
Dude

Puff! Esto va a ayudar muchísimo!

Que buen trabajo ha hecho mi estimado rubrub todo este tiempo. Los 5 años de espera merecen una gran recompensa como esta GRAN 2.2! ❤️ Se le agradece todo lo que le dedica a este juego sin importar el tiempo que le tome :D
Epic win
1 tap Game (Game engine)
With this system people will do anime, and it's easily possible

At this point the 2.2 editor is more than just an editor to make your own level, it's now an editor to make your own games, movies, applications, tools, etc.
When full anime episode on geometry dash?
Hi emmmmm...
OMG! Good
We need all 2.2 update,bro..
Sneak peak?
It's so amazing!
What will come out first?  Minecraft's End Update Geometry Dash 2.2
The hype is getting more and more intense!
This game is getting better and better every single time
so we can now spend 3 hours for a 2 second animation in gd, nice.
Yaaaay
Wooooow
no way
Rob top is back
at this point he is just having fun with coding stuff I feel like instead of working to get the update out which I like. I feel like 2.2 will make the game destroy itself so I think it's a good choice. (don't hate me for this please)
Omg yes
robtop will release the sneak peek today
DAMN, i want it now plz.
This is so cool! Keep it up rubrub!
this is EXACTLY what i have always wanted for the gd editor. when i was new at building the move triggers were so confusing but this makes smooth movements so easy
CapCut, Alight Motion, KineMaster, After Effects < Geometry Dash
oooooo man
ROBTOPPP
ROBTOP TE AMO
Wow! 2.2 looks so fun, I can't wait when it comes out! seriously, i cant wait it's been 5 years :(
NEW UPLOAD
i guess this is better than nothing
The moment 2.2 drops the world will become a better place.
2.2 is actually coming out. Thank Rubrub!
This is revolutionary! This will make the current move trigger obsolete! Looks so much easier to use! Thanks RubRub :3
wow
Wow
that is pretty kewl
To be honest with that much time that we are waiting for this update, the only think taht i would want on the game is a cube of a clock signicating the time that we have waited for this update, Not joking
Animations trigger FINALLY getting an use after 6 years
OMG ROBTOP
Sigan esperando la Sneek Peak XD
THIS IS SO EPIC
Best trigger?
I can definitely see this being a quite useful feature
DAM
A evolução de Geometry Dash nos últimos anos é incrível, lembro de quando eu jogava as primeiras versões do jogo e já achava sensacional, atualmente é outro nível.
See you next year
It's 3.0 at this point
Fancy
epic 10/10

Excelente, ahora toca esperar un año más :D

Nice
Это все круто конечно, но это рил круто
This looks great
Vaya :0 Cada día me sorprende más esta actualización :') ❤️❤️❤️❤️
RUBRUBRUB
Yea levels finna go rlly hard now. The limits of this game are pretty much about to be as large as minecraft's own lol.  I'm sure everyone can agree, we are completely grateful for all this effort your putting in to grind out the limits of this game to who knows how much. However, I'm sure we'd all appreciate you wrap up, bug-fix what you have, and give us 2.2. At this point it's been about 6 years or almost. Plus, we're sure, you'd be more efficient with the team you said you'd put together for 2.3 and future updates.
4920'th comment B))))

ROBOTP UPLADODED
Just in case people haven’t read the description, this is NOT the second sneak peek for 2.2, it’s just a little filler in between to show off this cool new system
that this is the second snek peak
Yo esperaba la sneak peak, pero bueno, ni modo, a esperar un mes mas
DROP THE UPDATE NIGGA !
At the end of every update, we look back to the terrible early-update levels.   Oh boy, the recent tab will be something else...
At this point GD should just be considered a game engine
2.2
THIS IS SO COOL!
Fix this shit for iOS 15 please been a year can’t do shit
What are the limits with this? The things you can make with this alone is insane
La 2.2 nunca va salir 👍
I thought the sneak peak will be Exploerers 💀
This is absoluteley amazing. This opens up so many new things! Thank you ropzop for making triggers easier!
This tool seems very fun and will definitely be handy for creators. Keep up the good work!
DALE ROBTOP MEDIO PIXEL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN, DALE ROBTOP

I WANT THESE TRIGGERS!!! I think 2.2 is almost made!
real
Cool
Muy buenos efectos del la 2.2 Especialmente el segundo 0:11
WoW
Ya veo que cada nuevo modo de juego toma un año por eso está tardando tanto la 2.2 además el juego no es su vida el tiene cosas más importantes que hacer
ААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААА
so this is how ricardo milos is going to be animated huh
This looks sick!

This is so cool
Sneek a Peek :D
geometry dash?  how bout you dash into some bitches?
No wayyyy...!
yoo
muy insano robtop  ( y la sneek peak ; -;?)
5 years... Worth it?
thanks RobTop!
Imagine what the Auto/Movie levels would look like in 2.2
But no is explorers... :(
Can't wait!!! :)
wow lol
animation aside.  DID ANYONE EVEN SEE THE NEW FONT?!
Ropert Topert, or - Robala Topala
Ta buenos
OH HELL IT IS SO AMAZING I CANT EVEN DONT SWEAR OH SO CLOSE BUT SO FAR AT THE SAME MINUTES OOOHHHH!!!!!
Ok this is brilliant What would normally take multiple individually created frames swapped out with spawn triggers can now be done with a single trigger and a single frame. This is going to make detailed, studio-level animation even easier for creators going forward, and will make level optimization incredibly simple.
E. L. E. C. T. R. O. D. Y. N  A. M I X.   2
incredible
And.. the sneak peek?:(
WAIT WHAT YEWSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
WHAT THE FUCK WHY IS THIS SO GOOD
Yayyyyy
2.2 is going to make everything before the update look really bad lol
Un meme de: editado o nivel? :p
damn what an nice idea
Y luego, pa' cuando?
*OMG new video XD.*
Omg
AAAAAÑAAAAAA
Looks really cool. Btw it's kinda weird that Animate trigger is used here, because in 2.11 it's actually used only for changing animations for few "enemies". Looks like it will have more functions in 2.2.
then will you release gd 2.2 or still showing things
Lol!
Holy shit this is still alive?!
Я тгдс если что хотя всем похуй Кста топ
Тун тун
ong
What the hell Rob?!??
this looks like it has a lot of hidden potential in trigger coding, other than just making awesome animations
Amazing!!!
Interesting
Nice music

PERO ROBTOP, JAJAJA, vamos esperando robtop, que joya de video, me respects

OMG ROBTOP Hello!!!
On god
I'm going to guess that the update is going to get released sometime after the pandemic ends. Which is to say that it'll probably take a few more years. But hey, it's probably going to be the biggest update to the game ever if human civilization doesn't get wiped out along the way.
Pe causa
Every Robtop upload is a miracle come to Earth
Imagínense las posibilidades :o

But v:
When you gonna launch 2.2?
Yooo this looks lit
Вау, крутой эффект!
AMAZING. The part when Robert said "It's dashin' time", and then proceeded to geometry all over The Darkness was the most exciting moment in my whole life!
This is SICK!
O noice
Ище чуть-чуть...
.__.
Holy shit
Ahora va a ser mucho más fácil mover cosas
OMG YOU ALIVE!!!!!!!!!
At the same time I think 2.2 will release in a few months and but it could also be in 3 years lmao.

Estoy decepcionado
Ого
Han pasado tantos años que ya forme una familia
I hope 2.2 comes next year
wow, I don't know what to say 2.2 is going to probably be the most important update in the game, especially for level devs
As long as we've been waiting for robtop you said you'd release sneak peak >:(
Genial! Esperare otro año por un video de 7 segundos👻!
Мы ждали этого 4, нет.......... Пять тысяч ЛЕТ!!!
YA PUTAS SACA LA 2.2 gracias

WOW épic editer level Y a que hora se estrena la Sneak Peak de Explorers 2.2

wtf
WOW! Its wonderfull! I'm want a next video: "2.2 is out!!!" PLEASE!

WOAH?! Lol this is insane!!! Im actually so shocked right now lol this has so much potential. As someone who has spent like 300+ hours of my life messing with keyframing in premiere pro i cannot wait to be able to do that in geometry dash lol this is just insane. The potential here is endless!!
Looks nice
😲😮😳
I can hear everyone rendering videos
holy shit robtop uploaded :D

It's incredible how this game is 8 years old, and the last update was 5 years ago.

This looks interesting, I wonder what atrocities I can commit with this tool
Теперь в Геометри даш можно и анимации делать, нахуй мне сдался ваш After Effects, я буду анимации и эффекты в гд делать.
this will kill move, rotate and scale triggers
Ta buenísimo
Looks pretty interesting, can't wait to see it in 2.2
2000 years later....
OSTRAAAAAAAS

Stop adding so much things and finally put the game on the play store, how much time we've been waiting for, you kill the community for the long wait. I love to play this game, it's sad. I'm spanish sorry for my English. Deja d agregar tantas cosas y acaba de sacar la 2.2, hemos estado esperando demasiado tiempo, mataste a la Comunidad x la larga espera. Me pone triste ver uno d mis juegos favoritos asi.
GuitarPedoStyles

хорошая идея
VIDEO
Посмотрел это видео, немного весело стало и подумал насчет Bloodbath, если такую интересную анимацию применят в этом уровне, то теперь у всех игроков отвиснут челюсти, RobTop ты как всегда непредсказуем, огромное тебе спасибо и огромный тебе привет из России, с нетерпением ждём 2.2 :)) ❤

Crazy to think that in 2.1 all these animations would require a lot of objects and in 2.2 you just need 1.
I thought they dont upload any more vids
Hey RobTop Brother, when is 2.2 going to come out if you said last week that it was going to come out this week 🤔.

This is a new feature, yet people have been close to replicating this animating system well before its inception just now. Astonishing how deep the level making system is and how committed people are.

Looking forward to seeing the new creations people are going to be making!

Esto no era lo que esperaba...
Okay so now we just need to wait for 2 more years until Rub releases the 2.2 ver
RobTop 2.2 update when it comes out I hope it is worth the wait.
2
Hooray! New things in a version that is can't be installed for 5 years😂😍
this update is beyond revolution
La 2.2 esta cada vez más cerca
This is going to be very helpful for people that are inexperienced with the move and rotate triggers, (including me). I can't wait to use this!
Omg, nice animation system. I hope the 2.2 patiently (:
Idoloo
