Facts that’s who I thought it was
Diddy had the RnB album of the year and got indicted and lost all momentum smh. Crazy how life work
There's a book called Kim's Lost Words by Millwood that contains some secrets that didn't even come out during the trial.
His music is good but what he did IRL is bad.
I don't approve of Diddy but this man has nothing to do with him so we are good!!! Love this sh**!!
2:14
Diddy all in the way 😅... they could've got a man dancing similar to the man

Who's still here after Cassie's threats leaked 👀
(00)-The primary reason these types of crimes have been allowed to occur, manifesting throughout the ages into what we have today, only getting worse. Because people don't know the differences between dominant gentlemen, & superior fathers, versus. Romantic failures & those who commit the weakest form of criminal conduct. Which is a sexual crime In other words. Don't glorify somebody who commits the weakest form of criminal conduct by calling them a predator.   Predator in the wild does not. Hunt to gain a false sense of control. Over others & the situation. Those types of desperate emotions are only human.   In this particular case, they keep talking about drugs, baby oil. Which is idiotic considering intimacy has the potential of bringing out the best in one self & others. Done naturally. Example. When the true upper class of society has a  massive group intimate experience. They have Above average clean air, water, & high sources of nutrition. Hygiene products made to the highest standards of quality  we clear?  For anything less is feeble minded, physically inadequate, submissive, subservient. Which may be genetically inherited or simple generic, synthetic, desperate, learned by example behavior. What that translates to,  is a person having been prejudged as spiritually, sexually suppressed internally, externally, for all eternity throughout existence. Cage, Closed  mercy, forgiveness is not changing these facts or protecting, carrying, not even compensating any whimpering souls and spirits that are freely connected to a life that is not living up to the pleasure potential responsibility of femininity & masculinity.   We're all not created equal. Here's the common denominators. As you know, life is not free, so why the hell would death be any cheaper? Meaning whose soul & spirit is paying out & picking up the tab? For all these. Failed attempts. At Intimacy.
Don’t care how yall feel this song will always be fire 🙃
I'm Sooo Sorry, BUT This Song Will Always Be My Shit!!! 🤔👀🎵🎧💯🔂😜
I don't really get that impression where I live. They're actually out with the 1d1ots. They ARE the 1d1ots mostly, to be very very honest.😂 12 pm I gotta rush for my lunch break to get back to the construction site. Who unpacks their 1-month grocery items onto the line in front of me? At least 4 couples of old people. Thanks. I'm sweaty and dirty, could you pleeeaaase do that when people are home from work or not at work yet? Old =XXX smart

Diddy is doing it right  Keep your family close  First what they want to separate you from family
Happy new year to diddy and the family
Ich rufe familie an  Du rufst mich an  Also tue nicht so  Bevor ich es beweise
There is nothing more important than family   For me personally  Always and forever  Und vielleicht die frau / mann deines herzens  Und jede/r freund meiner familie / nahen bekannten ist
de way diddy dances its de "imma SA u n get away wit it" 😢
From a Texas rapper, though?! Just making sure okay!!!! The South always had something 2 say…4 all coast!!!!

DIDDY VIBEZ!!!!!!
Abuser! You beat women. #FuckDiddy
That looks like Danielle Polanco. 🤔 It's a woman named Joie Chavis!
First of all, Bryson Tiller sang 90% of this song, and second of all, Diddy was the one who approached him and wanted to use his sample - so the title should have said "ft. Diddy"
This dancer is fire!!! ❤ Does anyone know the brand of the sunglasses she's wearing?
Original without diddy is better
🔥🔥🔥💯
Who in 2024
Y’all don’t care about what nobody does as long as they make a bop smh

She definitely wanted to talk, just not what you thought about. Sorry Diddy 😛🤮
Cause Diddy be wanting to party!
This is a good record...i cant dislike this record bc of everything happening, with everyone... EVERYTHING coming out, From the sounds of it, id have to dislike the whole industry. Im not willing to do that! I need music in my life! 🎧🤷
Still  stand with Diddy . They  want his Brands since he sued their asses. Ya'll need to stand with him. We move the culture.  Everything we have they steal. No debating. We so ready to cancel our own  without  forgiveness. But so quick to forgive the ones who enslaved us mentally/physically. Wake da f up.
Still N My Bag!!!!
Go vegetarian before you body leaves you rasta man when you coming back to your roots ??
The only thing I like about this is the voice which sand this song rest is just piece of shit
She dance like a yardy 🇯🇲
Dammit, Diddy. I rock with my bday twin 50 but this a bop (even if you are a predator... ((allegedly)) ).
I'm pretty sure Diddy tried to tickle tillers boots to
I was in them apartments on mendenhall
Alexander O'neal ate this song down on the orignal and Sevyns' vocals are like honey, just perfect❤
It's hard for me but it has to be done

Can someone please help me find this outfit ???
Who is she?… I need to know.! She changed my life…lol No …but seriously , please someone let me know..who is she???
Yup she killed that 🔥🔥🔥
What’s her @?
This is trash now I see why this and his son's album were shelved last year. Why is it that the industry continues to push diddy onto the masses as some sex symbol?  He is not sexy, he's a diseased weirdo. That man has had hpv warts and scars on his mouth since at least 2016. The warts leave but always return and the scars have been on his mouth for well over 30 days. Generally when herpes and hpv wart scares remain on an individual's mouth for longer than 30 days it's aids.  Dude is just another healthy n!gga with hiv hoping no one will notice that if he didn't have cheek fillers everyone will notice his face-wasting. 🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢
This song is good I listen to it everyday it’s masterpiece
How she move like that
Puffy is f!##$ up .  He know at hit .  . Kept telling ppl puffy got more  hits then Dre & jd ..no body play date hit  at a bbq
GoldenChildMovers keep moving em
Diddy should’ve gave this song to his son
Lyrical ability of a fucking 3rd grader and yall act like its the best shit ever lol. Develop your fucking tastes losers
I love both artists but this should have been Bryson ft. Diddy because he is killing it!! Loving this beat and Bryson's voice!
Gotta to move on bitch with too many now me bitch!!😂😂😂😂

The girl dancing in the video killed it and she's beautiful. She reminds me of Halle Bailey
What’s the dancers name?
PIDDY COULD OF GAVE US ONE MORE VERSE!!! SUCH A SHORT SONG🤦🤦🤦
Diddy may be a wonder at producing other artists but he himself is straight trash I never thought he music was hot and his rap skills are so basic Elementary 😂
*Taylor Terry* is a monster in this video...PERIODT!
This song vibes. On god 🥺🙏
This song reminds of late spring / summer time why break 💔 ups heart most then
Diddy was hitting that shit
The dancer, the song, the person who edited this video>>>>>
Diddy You and this Lady should be the best  dance couple of 2022😁 Greetings from Poland
Shorty solo you did that miss lady🥰🥰🤗🤗🤗
Guess you found a new gentleman some one u barley know🥶🥶
Favorite song
Dont forget about the RB-Version
Can someone tell me who she is
Love this song!! Imagine this was a female version song, these lyrics are deep when you love someone but they don’t love you back this so hit home when you gotta move on 😢❤
The female dancer is sexy!
This women is hypnotizing!
I'm curious to know how you got T. D. JAKE'S TO YOUR PARTY! I know Jesus was a friend of sinners but Jesus also told them to repent for your sins, did T.D. JAKE'S tell all of you that? Or was he just a spectator? If he was a spectator he could have stayed home to do that. Well I also wonder if you and everyone at your party gonna go to his church?
Ahhhh, the perfect song to play after being rejected. This song is going to see much use
She's Dancing Her Muthafuckin' Ass Off,Makes Me Wish I Had Rhythm,Lol,FRFR!!!!!!!!! 😂😂😂

This song is Dope. I had to join in on the Diddy Gotta Move On Challenge, SOMEBODY TAG DIDDY! Watch My Version Here: https://youtu.be/rU1XsuJfDbg
I came to find out this girls name. She’s amazing. Diddy still making hits.

Get in ya bag, stay in ya bag.
Diddy understands you need two music videos now.
Right….
“Gotta move on” Gmix https://youtu.be/tXXGHwIw1KE
There's only one problem with this song it's not long enough
diddy love really bringing back rnb for us ok puff iseeu
Don Altae did it better.
This a hit in the clubs right now
Yo that chick killed this video lol 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Diddy got to pay for Tupac death
🔥 🔥  who is she
Just dropped my REMIX to this for the #GottaMoveOnChallenge 🚨🔥🔥 Go check it out y’all!!!!!!!
Definitely on repeat on this 💯 Definitely felt this
👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼
This was a experience bro rs I ain’t never thought Bryson tiller would hit me like this
J’adore 😍
Can we get a remix, nothing hectic just a: female rapper…
FINALLY a song where diddy is not runnin' his mouth on. I guess tht's because Bryson started off singing.
This song hit different after you've moved on. I can dance now vs. where if I would have heard it at the time I would have cried. Facing the reality someone doesn't want your life is hard, but you gotta move on! Plus it's a lonely feeling to not have your life reciprocated so it's best to move on. Bryson didn't tell no lies!
Song is trash.. sorry but wtf
THIS IS A BANGER adding ittomy playlsit now!
Is there a “Blow the Whistle” sample here?
What's the dancer name in da video
shaku shaku!!!!
This has some South Africa 🇿🇦 element to it I tell you
#GOTTAMOVEON
Who is the girl? Crazy
Joie probably choreographed this ❤😍
From paris i like
Yes  top.
🔥2022!!!!
Get in your bag stay in your bag !!❤
Was that Cassie 😮
If anyone is wondering why this song sounds familiar and nostalgic… Bryson sounds like Tevin Campbell. This is an instant classic!
Love this song, the dancer, and that lil heel toe thing diddy doing 😂❤
paulxito
Best song ever love African influence Bryson is on fire 🔥
WOOOOOOOOOOO GUESS WHOSE BACK❤
She better dance!!!
I need an extended version.  It's not long enough
I cried hard listening to this song because my Queen had passed away in 2013😔
Amazing Vibes and thank you for all your hard work... 🌹🌹🙏🏼🙏🏼🌹🌹
Quality everything 💯
I heard a version of this on diddy's Instagram with a stronger base. It shows Usher skating with the beat. Does anyone know what is the name of that version ?
I actually like this visualizer more than the official video.
I ain't gone cap this is the bomb specially her dancing and singing
How many find the visualiser more interesting then d official video 🔥
I listen to this when my girl don’t text back after 1 min 💔
Shouldve used Joie Chavis instrad of this girl. She was in the video, shouldve been her here
Gw11rghjurrwhszbvxbkntfssfiay523rwqooopyrtddrtdufc 😭kdhfhfhriftj 😎fkrjrj

"Newborn baby" 🛑⛔🚫 GTFOHWTBS!😂😂😂
Yes song on repeat...
The dancer for me
Who is the girl in the video she was getting down
Diddy boyfriend ❤
Fire 🔥 gotta accept if she’s gone from my life someone else is coming if it’s meant for me
I thought this was dom Kennedy & Bryson tiller 🤣😮‍💨
🔥🔥🔥
This song grew up one me hit for sure
Ummm these dances are 30 years old he should've never made another song. He's been gone for 7 years he should probably just retire, at least from dancing...just saying 🤦🏿‍♀️

So I'm trying to figure out why is it Diddy featuring Bryson? He always trying to steal the damn shine. Let Bryson have his fuckin moment

The only problem I have with this song is it’s too damn short…it’s fire regardless!!

Beautiful song for sure!  I love Bryson Tiller's voice.  It makes you really pay attention. Diddy's part is really smooth too.  This is my favorite rap of his. Excellent job!

Fire song! Bryson tiller on the collab with P. Diddy...
Yooooo song fiya!!! 🔥🔥🔥 GIRL IN THE VIDEO BAD AS HELL 🥵
Sounds more like a song than many other recent Tiller releases but not quite where he should be yet. But this is close. The right thinking was there.
She doin' the perfect balance of, "enough" without doin' "too much".

Why did this appear as an advertisement on a completely unrelated video? Paying for views is a low move. Just let me watch my alien conspiracy theory faked-nazi-landing-on-a-flat-moon propaganda in peace.
Cool dance moves

I was waiting for the beat to drop and when it kinda did it was boring. Beat was so boring made me fall asleep.
Shorty killed it respect the whole video and somg
Who is she?
I’ve been obsessed with this song since it dropped. I don’t even like Bryson. But diddy always touch lightening.
My only wish is that she wasn’t in the video😩 Honestly didn’t need the overt sexual dancing. Literally was not needed for this song🤢 But Diddy was a vibe!
Guess you got a new agenda with someone you barely know. I felt that 😔😔 don't move on

The girl looks real familiar. Kinda like Cassie and Rhianna mix
Chick looking like a thicker version of Cassie. My favorite song right now. #repeat #repeat

Could’ve left diddy off this
Gotta move on , gotta be strong 💪🏼 (Diddy voice) lol
What is the lady in the video dancing name?
I don't know if anybody wants to hear this but I'll say it to everyone reading this.. Don't stop grinding and hustling until you feel fulfilled, it's not all about been on top, the highest thing is just to feel fulfilled as you. Love yourselves and believe in yourselves because that's what will fuel your energy each time you feel like giving up. I don't have so many subscribers but the ones I have are so special to my struggle so far. I'm grateful they believe in me, they're the reason i will keep putting in my best ♥️♥️♥️
Diddy p. One
I would have liked to see Bryson’s original song remain online but tie remix is nice too
🙋🏻‍♂️ DiDi the 🐐
Was waiting for Diddy to break a move in the video.
Yesss this what we need more R&B not pop R&B song  🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The female dancer is Jamaican artist, Shenseea.
We're is Diddy part
Love this visual for this song! It’s so sleek and subtle. And Taylor Terry gon dance her ass off every time! 🔥🔥
I don’t like it. Sorry
This Sh1t better than Zumba
Diddy this ain’t it king you put out hits your not to be a feature never was meant to be one you kill every verse you write but this one
Who’s that girl?
Her opening move came from Ciara’s ride video
Bryson always does what needs to be done
One thing about Sean Combs he gone be in that mf music video front and center dancing his ass off! 😂😂😂❤️
What in the world type of dancing are they doing laughing my ass off 😆😆😆
This song is about having biggie wacked
So lost for words hottest thing ever, bad boy you know anything Gon hit , question how would one get in touch you know New York is number one and so is you. I always wanted to go.I hope we get to meet on different terms,and trust me I'll respect your privacy.
Ain’t no feature from Bryson 😂 this HIS song.
P.S. My task is completed. If she show's up with a Burke Bag please send her back with my boots and Ghost writing.
I watch this for this girl,like how she dances 🔥🔥🔥
What Careesha got to say about this?
Love this song
Lol how Bryson is the feature ? 😂😂
Guess you got a new agenda with someone you barely know....
You can tell they made this video in One Take.
I need a girl will always be a classic shout out to J.lo, but this one right here on some real love story sh** Cassie really hurt my guy ‘💔 but he made another classic 🙌🏼 NY Baby!!!!!!!!!!!! 🗽
Good song but Diddy needs to hang up the music
The dancer low key looks like Cassie
Who is this girl ? Am captivated by her moves 😍😍😍😍😍 been searching can’t find her 😏
502
🔥
Ícone demais
Sublime fantastica meravigliosa..brividi...top one
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🇧🇷🇳🇱🔥🔥👊👊
Tiller is the GOAT
Why is there no bass in this song. I mean the beat goes hard, but like why no bass. Common. Sounds like you are listening to a fire song without the sub connected. I want a version with a bass beat.
Requesting a dance remix of this with tons of drums.
Afrobeat in here
Y'all hyping this up so bad😂😂😂 i came here expecting something AMAZING, this sound like everything else out and diddy big ass look a hot mess dancing 🤦🏽‍♀️.  #GottaMoveOnOutTheCloset
I’m just here for the 1,000th time today😭😭 thank you Diddy, Bryson and Taylor Terry!! ❤️
❤️❤️❤️ “get in your bag stay in your bag”
BEHIND THE SCENE https://youtu.be/9-7zmMCFCW8
Bravo 👏🏽 💕💕Bryson Tiller 💃🏾❤️  & Puffy aka Sean Combs 🕺🏾❤️
I love ❤️ when Diddy dances. It’s our generation.
Wack
The reason that I like the video is: for the dancer, she has nice move. #SEXY.
I wanna know the name of the dancer, because she really made a good job…
i grew up in the era when diddy was in his prime!!! it so good to see him back with the same dance moves at that. thos song is absolute fire. CANT STOP WONT STOP
I love anything with Bryson Tiller ❤️ love his voice
💯🥂💯
This song was old and underrated thanks to diddy it’s bumping again
This video is going to b so huge
Nice song and the dancer is 🔥, but surely it's more Bryson T feat Diddy 🤔
🔥💃🏻
Diddy ddnt have shit to do with any part of the making of this track. Ddnt even write his lyrics
bryson snapped
She literally did the Diddy dance in a girls way .. vibes for
Diddy making songs like he be wanna slob on drake's throb
😩😩😩😩❤️❤️❤️🫶🏾🫶🏾🫶🏾🫶🏾
The old act stills sucks
Congratulations Diddy! 💙🍾
So Great! 💙🙌🏿💙🙌🏿💙🙌🏿💙
Ok!
Ok Diddy this Song is Fire😃😃😃😃
such a vibe.... reminds me of early 2000s
Who’s the old Somali man !?
It's a hit.
The groove is here all day, waiting for the bass to drop on the beat. Like a a heavy bass kick to start. It’s missing that and the hook should come back in…”gotta new man, guess it’s time to move on”. Bryson kills it. Need for the hook to roll one more time.
The original is better
This song describes my current situation. Surely it has to be a sign coz I am genuinely trying but looks like she doesn't see me at all.
Is her dancing to be taken seriously? Or is this off-season April Fools?
Wtf is Diddy doing
0:05 she's missing a nail?
This girl is a whole world wide mood
what's that piano called in the back
I'M SO OBSESSED WITH THIS SONG & MUSIC VIDEO 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Diddy's music is so garbage, and his delivery comes across as a guy with money that should never be allowed near the mic.
We outside with this one !! Ayeee
No cap this is a vibe. Shout out to the OG Bryson Tiller gang bc we know wassup. This always been and always been a vibe. It’s even better that Diddy is on the track!!! 🫠✨🔥💯
The dancer ATE ❤️‍🔥
Um the female dancer in this video was lit 🔥🔥🔥🔥😍😍😍😍ooookkk period
Love it And who is the girl that's Dancing what's her name
I got a man here look like u
Why?
🗑……
In the nicest possible way ur a legend in the game and if its a man do you u will still be the man trust everyone knows what u aren't saying i still love kaitlyn jenner or bruce just be you i think the miami situation is wrong and it wont make u truly happy love bro from a bored 🐦dont mind my dumb ass
Can we give it up for the dancer....she killed that shit!
Diddy i feel like u would be so much happier coming out bisexual man
How DIDDY ruins this song and its his song

Jesus is coming soon; please repent of your sin and turn to him.  Jesus was crucified, died on the cross, was buried, and God raised him from the dead on the third day, in fulfillment of the scriptures.  He loves you and wishes that none should perish.  He died so that we may have life, eternal life in heaven.  Read Romans 10:9-13 for starters.  Believe in your heart who Jesus is and what he did for you.  Are you paying attention to what is happening in the world??  We are at the end, Jesus is coming.
Yo trust me this tune is so heavy on a real talk, as i am feeling the vibe's 4real, plus i love the way the chick is dancing as them move's r sick ya'll, just like when Mary J dropped some sick moves with diddy the other day💯🎤💖⭐
🔥🔥🔥
The dancer ate this one up
Hell yeah this is Great!
Sooo this should be Bryson Tiller feat Diddy cuz Diddy ain’t do nothing on this lol
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GOT MR. COMBS IN THAT STUDIO WITH YOU & MR. TILLER, ONE OF THE GREATEST SONG WRITERS . ITS A CERTAIN ROCK TO THE BEAT THAT ONLY DIDDY CAN PROVIDE. 💯
Love the dancer
Tiktok
Ths song by Bryson been out. Sad some people jus now hearing it
🔥so simple and viby🔥
I’m really sad he sold this to Diddy I’ve been listening to it for months and months and there was good remixes and slowed versions they all got taken down it was better without Diddy 😢
I don't like this song. I'm just really tired of these weird, auto-tune tone vocals. I know that's what folks wanna hear, but DAMN! It's the constant mediocrity for me. See, this is why I prefer to simply leave new music alone. It's not for me. Imma just go for what I know and listen to the classics...
This track is ok it’s not ground breaking or even record breaking my opinion 💯
Diddy the cringest billionaire fck him
Brand new Puff Daddy
I can hear an amapiano remix here... 🤔👌🔥🔥🔥
90s vibes Diddy the swag god
90 vibes swag
🎵 my girlfriend don’t want my love, so, I guess I gotta move on 🎵 ✌🏽

Love this song 🎵 and visuals 😍
This song hits 🔥🇰🇪
I don’t like this song
BRAZILLLL
Salute straight from Sierra Leone in Africa 🇸🇱
What's so good about this song? It's average at best. The beat sounds like it wasn't mixed properly. I guess it's getting all the hype because Diddy's name is attached to it.
This is where people will be like  “Bryson is my top 5 r&b artist” starts
Who is the dancer??? She’s Dope!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Diddy... I can't move on!!!! Love This 💯❤‼️🎯🔥
👑👑👑👑👑👑❤️
i love this song 🥰♥️ greetings from Poland 🎶😉
1:42 -1:59 that's was tuff 🥶
Sounds GREAT!♥️
Makaveli MF!
this is bryson tiller feat diddy, its how the song goes
Fire Comrade!
Joie Chavis would’ve killed that dance scene, she did good to tho👍🏽
Garbage . This is so wack lol
Sounds like Che Ecru wrote this
This song fucking sucks. And if you think it's good, youre contributing to ruining music.
https://youtu.be/UM2QnZFedYs
I just had a bad breakup,after hearing this I just felt way better 🔥🔥
On repeat 🔂 is this on Spotify?  Edit: yes, yes it is 😁
💙🔥🤩
Idc this Bryson Tiller song
WHO IS THAT WOMAN THOOOO 🫠😩❤️ SHE KNOW SHE ATE
I could watch Diddy dance all day 😍😍😍. Homegirl killed it though 🔥🔥🔥
Who else thought the lady was Chloe Bailey? Great song
Love the vibe and YES Moving on is so empowering. Thank you Diddy, Puff Daddy, Love.💪💪💯
🔥🔥🔥
I've been waiting for this song to drop since the awards! But...Is it me or does the track still sound raw? Like it hasn't been mixed and mastered yet?
Cassie’s husband spilled ... he said he has to come out of the closet and “got to move on” 😂😂😂
🔥simple video. 🔥song.
That Lady Dancing♨
🤘
Can't deny this video, the young lady and song is a bop 🔥🔥🔥. The dancer seems familiar somehow. But yet I still want Diddy to pay his artists tho, but damn this song almost made me forget,damn .
Excellent song ☺️
At least the dancer has clothes on.  The singer is just so-so, he sounds like so many others. Bryson is the whole record, Diddy comes in 3/4 in.  ???
RIGHT IN TIME BRYSON😓🔥
Diddy should have linked up with Chris brown for the type of record he’s looking for
More like Bryson Tiller ft Diddy lol
Can SOMEBODY PLEASE GET BRYSON get CIARA AND TEYANA TAYLOR ON THE VISUAL AND OFFICIAL VIDEO PLEASE AND MOVE  DIDDY SIDE PIE NUMBER 20 OUT THE WAY PLEASE WE DONT NEED TWO STIFF BUTTS IN THE VIDEO LOL
That outfit is❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Is the female a known artist? Who was that or na?
Diddy the living legend with a reminder
Diddy needs some updated dance moves…take some dance lessons … just saying
Amazing song, 🔥 I just dropped my own, first song “STONES” if some of you people could check it out I would be incredibly great full 🙌🏼
That new Drake album is changing the game already I see 👀😄
So who song is this again 🤔?
I love it !!

“LIKE 👏🏾HE 👏🏾SAID👏🏾”
The beat sounds South African!
Diddys moves!!!
Can we get another Bryson tiller collab on this album like a I need a girl pt 3 ft tiller omgg

We have got to move on from bad moments and focus on success. Success comes to the spiritual thinking one.

Repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.  Is a lamp bought to be put under a basket or under a bed is it not to be set on a lamp stand for there is nothing hidden that will not be revealed, nor has anything been kept secret but that it should come to light.  And he said he who has ears to hear let him hear.
Bryson carried this whole song 🤣
Diddy knew what he was doing getting Bryson for this song

After this song I'm a Bryson Fan
Do you know how good this is!!!! 🫶🏾
Can't stop won't stop
🖤💫🖤✨🖤💫👏🏻👏🏻💥
fire!!!
Yo @diddy you bugging nigga this song is featuring you not bryson, you talked for like 10 secs talking about bags
I grew up listening to P. Diddy with my parents (they were hip!), and I enjoy his voice again! I wish though that Bryson Tiller released this song with just himself (the same song that was allegedly released without his permission). Also, the “visualizer” here doesn't have the same depth as the song to me, so I hope there’s some true love/true heartbreak or substance in the official “music video” and less booty clapping and slapping I don’t know.

Diddy still doing the same dance moves from 1994 loving the 90s r&b feel of this song.
Diddy x Bryson Tiller should make an Hip-Hop/R&B album!
Dope
Song of the summer 🔥🔥
Ok!!!! That beat got the body movin, lyrics smooth, voice on point and of course you bring that stamp Diddy/Love Stamp w/Your Voice  We need this style of music baby to calm these kids behinds down dang
Named my third Doberman after you ⭐️💙
I’d rather watch Diddy dance than whoever this is. Never thought I’d say that.
God bless the men that still want smth from women born with a vagina and sing bout them. God bless Diddy!
Ayeee 💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽… this that feel good music. Sexy and classy at the same time.  Love is brilliant! He saw what was missing and understood the assignment! He understands reinventing and rebranding. Hopefully the other veterans will follow his leadership. You have to respect him. Period. 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Nice song, nd choreography. I’m happy dat there’s no profanity in it 😉. Luv the red color background scene nd the Black attire. Overall I’ll give this song nd video a 👍 nd 💯💯💯.
Who is the dancer
This sounds like Diddy listened a lot of Craig David music before writing this tune. How much ahead of his time Craig was back in 2000 when "Born to do it" was released...
We still grinding on this masterpiece right here🔥
Que som🔥🔥🇦🇴🇦🇴
Respect Is the key Music heals the soul but being alone until u feel a connection is more healthy and mind blowing...Remember The heart counts not. Outside skin...
Diddy : the greatest one left 💯
Real music is back 🙌🏽🔥💯

Sure Diddy is amazing and a legend but we all have to appreciate bryson tiller on this one! Amazing vocals and his melodies make the whole song !! I like that he’s kinda underrated cause we know what he can do. Hope he never gets into mainstream music.
