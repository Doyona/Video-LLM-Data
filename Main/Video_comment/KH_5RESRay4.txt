Such a cool and genuine dude. He deserves his fame.
taking drugs even if they are psychiatric is totally not sober.
I was on Zoloft. Made me way too tired, boring, and never wanting snusnu. Long story short, its better to be anxious all the time, than sedated. 🤣
Directly before seeing this, I watched Simon Pegg's essentials video and he also "recommended" the AG1 stuff. Suspicious much??
Love steve o but I’m leaving a dislike for the athletic greens (scam product) sponsor
I've tried that ag1 stuff and it's not delicious
im still getting high but i love ya dude 😂
so glad to see stev-o clean and in a better place, this guy alongnwith the rest of the jackass and wild boyz crew brought me so much entertainment growing up and inspired me and my friends to do similar stuff which made growing up a blast
Surprised there’s no monster munch
Steve o. Почему зубы не сделаешь не съёмные настоящие. 💯👍
Dickograph got me laughing so hard
I remember having a water pik as a kid.   It was very satisfying.
Wendy carried this!
You forgot ego
Steve o is the nicest humble person
U swallow the pick water bro?!
I think ill save these ideas for in the future 10 yrs
His tooth why did he take it out
I like charcoal toothpaste I do
Y know Steveo is crazy when one of his essential (items) is a dog
Can someone please explain how I can get my dog to become a service dog? I can’t find any information on specifics. Everything is so vague and difficult to find where I can actually get this done
I love that his laugh reaches his eyes. It's honest like that!
2-2-22
Anyone else triggerd by the fact that his pill organizer starts at sunday :D ?
👎 on tricking yourself zoloft works
Also it isn't a computer he said it is a laptop
Interesting but it is actually illegal to take pictures and send them to anyone of your private parts I also hope he washed his false tooth thoroughly before putting it back in when he put it on the table
I do love Steve O, but I cannot help but feel this video is just him trying to sell me products.
💪🥲👍
I take Zoe loft and cafress for my autism
Wendyyy❤❤. Xanax mix❤️
What about the raycons? Does this count? I want my vm recording!
That back scratcher is actually a back washer for the shower but ok
that AG1 got a link
AG1 is a scam. Don't buy it. You get all the vitamins you need if you don't eat like a pig all day
Anyone else tried Zoloft? I got “bipolar, depression and anxiety” no meds rn just trying to keep on keepin on. Looking for something that would help though
Nothing makes me happier than to see steve-o clean and sober
Why his dog look stuffed
this shows how steve o is just a pure human being
Im surprised a skateboard isn’t on here
Haha Stevo you're my favorite of them all xD
before i watch this im gonna say half of these are his sponsers lol
Wendy all the way ❤
The dog is number 1....as it should be
I would've loved to see this interview at the height of his insanity I bet it'd be all kinds of crazy stuff
"Saying Steveo has bad breath is like saying wee man is short!"🤣🤣🤣
I first used zoloft, but it stopped working as well, ive been through three other meds until finding a new one that works well.
I’m surprised he didn’t mention Liquid death
Steve-o is so practical
Get $not on this
For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life John 3:16.
He can't live without hospitals either
Bro sounds like a mind controlled robot to advertise products
His voice irritated my sinus, very weird, however I couldn’t stop watching it till the end 😂
Proverbs 16:8 Better is a little with righteousness than great revenues without right.
Raddest dude to exist
Life is such a trip. If someone told me 23 years ago Steveo will be a great inspiration to me I would’ve called them crazy yet here I am and he really is my hero
Contiguous cups are disgusting- that trigger mechanism gets so grungy and you can’t clean it
Bro probably has anxiety that their gonna make a new jackass movie
There’s an alternative timeline where Steve O died or is brain dead. Happy to see he’s sober and doing well. You made my childhood awesome bro
it's cool to see him talk about using sertraline, i take them daily too so it's pretty cool :)
For those with Generalised Anxiety, Zoloft can be a great help. Always talk to your doctor.
how the, HOW did he takeout his tooth
I’m soooo glad he survived all them drugs and stunts. 🙏
Wendy is everything to him
No hate on Steveo but he seems incredibly inauthentic. Specifically in his podcast. He just seems so forced.
I totally only watched the whole video to see adorable and precious Wendy, knowing she'd be #1<3
amazing
I never seen the hotsauce
what kinda cameras are those ?
he's such a sweetheart. Honestly one of if not the best member of the Jackass crew.
All that progress for nothing when he mentioned Zoloft
Her daugther ( Wendy ) is such a charm. Long life Steve O
I would like to take that as a Challenge of having a full blown Studio in a bag pack    When I travel I have like 3 or 4 bag filled with all kinds of electronics
LMFAO! Steve O is officially a middle aged dad hahab
LMAO "clean and sober" yet taking zoloft
What tablets is he taking?
I got a anxiety disorder and got on medication and counselling and agree helped me with everything in my life anxiety wise
what about monstermunch
his hands.
bro Steve-O i take zoloft too
what prgoram do you guys use to edit this videos ? thank GQ
sharpies + his pup are in his top 10 essentials!! that really shouts volumes of his awesomeness!
I bet he still sniffs them markers
without his tooth it seems
He’s so very cool! Especially sober! What a great guy!
Thats because its a lufer not a back scratcher!! edit: does anyone else find it telling that he likes hot sauce too.  pain = pleasure for steve-o
Steve o can't live without trying to sell you sauce and AG1
What’s the organizing shelf he has? I need that.
I always thought Stevo-O was a huge jerk turns out he's a nice persone
good doggy 🐩🐕‍🦺🐶🦮🦮🐾🐩🐕‍🦺🐕🐶🦮🦮🐩🐕‍🦺
Steve-o just changed the way I pack my luggage
Johnny knoxville: "makes comment about his breath" Steve-O: And i took the personally
Your ok but my like is for Wendy. Not sorry 😂👌✌️
Wendy is very gorgeous 🥰
Don't swallow water pick runoff, it has plaque in it and it'll clog your arteries
Coffee is a drug Steve-O........just kidding
Jesus loves you ‘
...he swallowed his floss water?
dude u advertise zoloft... not swifty
Brother your tooth is gone. Tooth fairy. I got all my pulled out at no oneshowed up
I love the fact that Wendy is your number one essential. 😘🤗 God bless you for rescuing her. It says so much about your character. 🙏❤️
So happy for this guy, to continue being clean & sober. Nice, Steve-o!
These are actually essentials
Someone try replicating Steve-o's back scratcher. C'mon man.
He shouldn't be promoted, what he did his whole life was stupid and pathetic, he destroyed his body for a few chuckles for kids of the late 1990s and early 2000s to end up a mangled mess and deformed. Don't be like thos loser
at least he has gasp of what ESSENTIAL really is.
2:35 brooo I take Zoloft everyday too and we are both r3tarded twins yay! Let’s gooo 🌚🌝
He actually uses those things
I ur number 1 fan.. but why still take zoloftt
Hands down my fav celeb
Just a giant ad
love you steve o
0:42 Every single time someone says "Back Scratcher" it rinds me of Peter Griffin lol
i just noticed wendy has a ufc collar
Does this rub anyone else the wrong way?
Product placement king right here!
a man who loves his dog can't be all bad. :) except Hitler.
I just can’t believe I live in a timeline where Steve-O meditates.
Did he really just water blast gunk and bacteria out of his teeth and swallow the water 🤢
Funny thing is i have the same back scratcher as Steve-O
I’m just happy he has found happiness in sobriety, many people don’t get that
That’s a scrub brush not a back scratcher
Rich guy problems
Steve-O is a lot like Mike Tyson as he gets older. A reborn, pretty standup guy with a past that’s kinda hard to excuse. Two rare examples of people who ‘stepped over the line’ of morality and decency to become wisemen who try to show others the path to not do what they did.
The answer is coke.. mountain's of coke
in recovery  u rock 🪨🎸  alway watch u crazy guys
ammmm okay
MAN WHAT SUIT CASE/ PULL OUT THING IS THAT??? someone tell me plssss
Everytime I see this dude i think of the show *Jackass* 😂😭
in peru we love him cause he did what many people doesn't do here, adopt a pet
Zoloft really helps me be who I truly am too Steve-O!!!! I completely agree with you.
Hi GQ
Really glad to see him taking such good care of himself 🤘🏽
i feel like the jackass crew are all a bunch of professional morons, and i love it, just hilarious
GOD ALMIGHTY Loves you all give your life to JESUS CHRIST ALMIGHTY Before it’s to late and live for GOD ALMIGHTY NOT FOR THE WORLD. GOD ALMIGHTY bless you my friends
Jesus loves y’all! God bless y’all! God loves you and is your protector and healer. Praise be to Jesus!!! “God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble.” Psalm 46:1.
❤❤❤👊👊
Steve-o is such a great example of human's ability to change. Also congrats to him on finding the right medications for him. Sometimes people have a chemical imbalance that makes the depressed and need medication for it. It is okay to take that even if you are trying to be clean and sober
That was depressing
Lmao he forgot to show his crack pipe
i love steveo so much oh my god
She looks traumatized , like most Peruvian s
Like seeing who he was in the Jackass series and seeing who he is now, is beautiful. He looks great!
What model of Waterpik is that?
Me n Steve-o have the same speaker lmao
Bruh wendy looks like shes seen stuff
his opening line is straight gold
His carrying toiletries is oddly adorable
Good for you Steve O
Obviously not his teeth
Anyone suprised he just took his tooth out like that? Cause I'm not!
Zoloft for the win! Hahahaha very good for anxiety and depression. Couldn’t really function without it
i wish he was immortal. :(
I was lucky enough to meet Steve-O after one of his shows a couple years ago. At the end of his show, he said he wanted to meet everyone who was down for a meet and greet. For free. Almost everyone stayed for the meet and greet and he spent time talking with every one of us, signed anything we wanted AND took photos with everyone. FOR FREE!  He was soooooo awesome, I remember him asking what I did for a living and when I told him I was a Vet Tech he brought out Wendy 😭❤️  He’s just the best. Such a genuine guy. Yeah Dude!
steveo the professional unprofessional
I met Steve o in 2019 at the funny bone chill guy took a picture with him and everything
I like how every guy I’ve seen has brought his dog
*BRUH YOUR SUPPOSED TO HAVE YOUR MOUTH CLOSED!? I USE MY WATER PIK WITH IT MOUTH OPEN..... ON THE HIGHEST SETTING LOLOL*
My school’s band named a class pet after Steve-O It was a bag of mulch. Be we all love Steve o
Ugh the quick Athletic Greens plug.
That portable studio tho…
The orders he gets the crazy it is
11: Health Insurance card
I hope to be sober like this dude
LEGEND
Attention...x10
I always figured Steve O breath stank back in the day
Steve-o has gotten more and more pathetic over the years. He just needs to go away
The anxiety medication bit hit me different ngl
Lovehim. God bless him. ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Legend
Gotta love him <3 Childhood herooo 🤘
I have a waterpik and it’s incredible :D
Steve-O is the man.
is steve o more organized and healthier them me? 😂😂
Me encanto ❤️
Is it me, or is Steve-O looking like Knoxville now?
He didn't mention his cocaine, meth and Crack.
Jesus Christ is Lord and King and Our Savior!
I adore this man.
i wanna hug steavo befor i die
You would think your house your vehicle or a job would be in this list but apparently not yours we love you Steve-O
i used to hate this guy. now i feel a huge respect for him. brave and strong as it can gets.
That’s cool but, I went to Walmart yesterday and got a cool green red purple green blue pink yellow and black rug that was teal. Nice.
someone should tell him that these hard drives like to fail and lose data often  happend to me and many of my friends  i willing to say that i hate this brand and it’s not durable ! the rubber stuff doesn’t protect anything and like i said even without moving it , it can loose data sone times
When he pulls the tooth out i cracked
"I'm sober. Let me show you all the drugs I take to stay sober"
Wendy ♥️
I wanna kill myself after just 2 seconds hearing his voice.
I love this man
steve-o look so good and happy
😎😎😎
I was prescribed Zoloft at 14 years old for depression. I took it until I was 16.
I always find these cute when the celebs have dogs 🐕
This man helped me realize I can do fun things without getting the cops called on me. Although they are stupid
7:40 👏😏
Not gonna lie but when Stevo said he got the backscracther because he was feeling old and decrepit, that got me. Also, Knoxville calling Steve's bad breath, is like calling Wee Man short just killed me. No wonder these guys became famous.
He’s an entertainer
Yo I take Zoloft tooooooo🥰🥰. I love I take the same things as steveo😇
Steve is one of my favorite human beings. He’s always just him. Love him! Been a fan always will be!
Bring back World Peace
Not me thinking ag1 is something else😅🤨
Wendy is the best
I also don’t think he could live without saying “Yeahhh Dude!” at least once a day.
Wait thats a back scratcher?i use that as loofah
what's with meth heads and markers?
Surprised there’s no skateboard on this list
I love youuuuu Steve-O!!!
Disgusting child predator, people don’t even know close to the truth about STEVE - O
I didn't know he had a fake tooth
He is the only one who can be cast as Plastic-Man
He white so he can get away with doing stupid sh**
Uhh drugs?
What are the orange hard drives he uses?
i have the same thermos
I love this guy
Love it 😊💯
Can someone PLEASE tell me what lights he is using!!!!
Mannnnnn... If I could not love Steve O even more.. putting his meds especially, mental health meds in his essentials!!! I ❤️❤️❤️ YOU STEVE O!!!!
Dam I’m surprised that Steve O isn’t dead
P.s. Steve o if tu you can my dad just found out he has terminal cancer he's the reason I started buying big brother magazine he's a huge fan too could you send  a steve o fat chicks shirt to my dad he loves that shlirt I showed em on ur website but even if u don't I'll always a fan and a friend you haven't met yet my names Joe cushing
doggo
He predicted the water flosser
I like when Steve-O laughs. Lol. 😂
Crazy guy Haha, their is never gonna be another Steve o.
Good thing this wasn't made like 10 years ago
Steve-O is a walking W
i was fortunate to meet him and wendy last night through the tacobell drive thru line in mebane, nc on his way to Tennessee for a show.....nice man!! wished my kids who adore him could had met him. Dont worry they are 17 and 18.
The most open and honest man alive. So refreshing seeing someone not be ashamed of himself or his issues. I just love the guy.
I just can tell Steve was choking up when he brought up the bad breath story. Poor guy. Love you, Steve-O.
I gagged when he swallowed the waterpik water.
They should do a second installment. Not sober Steve-O 10 things. I bet there would be at least one water pipe, a case of high life and a 5 liter bottle of nitrous.
Unfortunately he is dependent on the zoloft. That is still a drug which he doesn't need </3
taking Zoloft you are not sober
This is a rarity - a "can't live without" featuring someone I've actually heard of.
Lvyou Steveo miss you awww Wendy....i remember you went to Peru right after I meet you at San Antonio TX 2014. Say hi to Scott for me 😉....and im really happy that you and your loved ones are doing well.😇
Such a shame to hear that steve-o isn't sober anymore and relies on Zoloft, I really hope he can make it out of that situation healthily. Antidepressant addiction is no joke and abusing them through continious use (more than a few months) has such terrible consequences. They're simply the lazy option and dumb you wither down your character so much, maybe his doctor should prescribe him an excersice routine instead as he's an obvious adrenaline junkie.
Belgian malinois and Xanax mix hahah 😆
salt
If you don't love Steve-O, you're a jackass. No pun intended :)
He sounds like he smoked at he age of 6
Thought hes gonna pull down his pants as the 10th essential^^
compare this to rappers' essential...
Wendy is an Angel!!!!
Knowing Steve-o takes Zoloft is weirdly comforting and relatable
I love you steve
Best glowup in human history.
Dang steve-o gettin chunky
She's a beauty. 🐾
Lol he pulled out one of his teeth
thats not a true belgian mallinois tho lol
The nervous chin psychologically check because dragonfly extragingivally play apropos a childlike ferryboat. daily, acid airship
Its crazy how steveo survived this long considering his dangerous stunts.
I’d love to see the 06 version of this
I love that he always brings Wendy with him ❤
i met steve o one time in hollywood, he was a jerk. Maybe he was in a bad mood...but he should've just told me....he's a jerk
doesnt sound like he is sober, sounds like he is addicted to zoloft
The dog is so cute, she looks like a great family member
4:03 Man that hits hard!!!!!!!! love ya steveo
this vid made me smile lol so pure
How can someone hate Steve O man
He deserves to have life figured out, his metaphorical and literal toolkit. He’s been through so much, put in the time on discovery and experimentation, gained the wisdom, now it’s clicked together as it should.
maybe time for a new brush? kinda gross lol
Very good and interesting content your a role model for a lot of us who are still alive after partying for 30 years. I'm still toking green but  so free and happy being off the booze thanks for your honesty.
It’s funny how most people of not everybody’s essential items are things they can carry. It’s never a house or a car or anything like that. I like that.  My 10 essential items:  -Photos of my family -Straight razor -Custom IEM & cable -Smart Phone -Aveeno Face Cleanser -Cologne -Soap -Boosted Board -DSLR Camera -Gerber Multi-Tool
Not me feeling emotional that Steve-o is on the same medication as me for mental health
I’m just here for Wendy
steve-o is great
Try and be a minimalist  greatest challenge  of your life scale down everything
His sauce names are exactly what I’d imagine he’d name them too 😂
what hapenned to his voice?
Stevo is awesome love his Podcast 😍🥳💯
Zoloft lol
great intro. Smart and straight
I take Zoloft too man😂
An ounce of cocaine...
ZOLOFT ADDICT
No TALENT
Zoloft really helps me too, its really nice to see a celebrity that also takes it.
I genuinely love Steve O, to be so transparent, open and real about himself is a true inspiration ❤ We're all human
Cocaine??
This just reminded me to take my Zoloft 😭
I love to see him with Wendy :)
since when did he have fake teeth like he just pulled it straight out like nothing
You can see that Steve-O definitely regrets his dental care when he starts to choke up when he tells GQ what Knoxville said to Wee Man about his breath. So happy he's in better shape now, he deserves everything in the world.
Where do I find that fold up organized hanger thing that was in his carry-on
So amazing to see Steve-O thriving and well! Yeahhh Dude!
Hey man, thanks for sharing, I had to get on antidepressants too but I've been really uptight about it and embarrassed. I shouldn't be and watching you be open about it on such a huge stage gives me a little strength. I don't feel as embarrassed. I mean you're rich and famous, I always get down on myself for even feeling bad because I know so many other's have it worse. Thx again Steve-O 🤘👊👍💯
Wendy +Steve-O = pure love. You rock brother! It's so good to see how you control your demons, yet still are in touch with the wild mofo we all wish we could be.
Pasta spoon = Ultimate back scratcher
Yes.
Western people has  lot of axiety because they need a lot things to live in they cannot live simple coz they thinks its boring they want to live a life soo much that they forgot how to live  with a goodlife and end up having a badmoments
Yeah Dude...I love Monster Munch too...Your a legend in ur own pants... And Lux & Wendy 😘
What an iconic personality, one of the few
Love him. So awesome to see him healthy 💛
Steve o you the man 🤘
bruh the dog does NOT want to be there
imagine him doing this interview 2 decades ago vs now
The fact that we got to see this man age is a miracle
What is so crazy about Steve-O is not just the fact that he has survived everything he’s done, but also how healthy he looks today. My guy is GLOWING.
Steve-O doesn't stop to impress me...  I actually recently began having tiny instants of jealousy where I entertain the notion of trading places to have his life...  Because if this guy isn't really living _some form_ of his _best life_ I don't know of anybody who ever did or will.
drugs
I KNOW HE DIDNT MENTION ZOLOFT 😭😭😭
That’s a pretty cool collapsible dresser!
Met him last year 2021 in the LAX airport, he was genuinely an awesome person…told him, i listened to his podcast and he told me to get my phone out so we could get a picture!!!
Zoloft was horrible for me
The part about his anxiety and going to a therapist to get on meds, though it was short and sweet I felt that and strangely made me feel better. Love this man a true GOAT.
You gotta love the modern Steve-O!!!
Protect Steve-O at all costs 😂😂
Such a rad dude that he literally carries around premium markers to sign autographs for his fans. Love this man!!
The sound effects he makes for the thermus 😂😂😂
Yeah dude
Steve o!!
The MAN
Sheeesh
Bro I was excepting him to pull out his tooth
Honestly. Zoloft is an incredible thing. Night and day difference.
My back scratcher is super important to me too so....I get it lol
He is so fine
*SPAGHETTI*
dog: *i am essential???!!!!*
Such a good dog.
He's an amazing guy, funny yet sincere. Love him!
love this!
ZOLOFT PEOPLE RAISE YOUR HANDS 🙋🏼‍♀️
Bro I love steve-o
Wendy is perfect
🐝
other people on this show: *yeah one of my essentials is my hundred thousand dollar, iced out rolex*  steve-o: *yeah so i like these markers*
It’s awesome to see the boys get their life back on track l… well Bam needs help still
Wendy is adorable
I love your hot sauce
OMG Wendy is so adorable! 😍
Idk It’s so upsetting for me to see them grow old after I’ve grew up watching them. But it is really awesome to see Steve O so happy
Love his list. He's just humble.
I have a Belgian too!!!!
He's come so far and I'm happy for him.
Steve-O is a role model he was at the bottom of his life then he realised people would pay for his stupidity/stunts and made a living out of it with Jackass and all the other things he does
lets be glad that steve o is still kicking and still sober, its sad that bam couldn't do the same
Bees was on this niggas sick 😟
We need Valentino Rossi 46 on GQ
Steveo’s just one of a kind
Haberme sacado a mi también de Perú
it's so funny to me to this man being rather mature  and organized while advertising for a movie that's gonna be him reaching the truest lows a person could find lmao
As an ex addict/ alcoholic myself the zolof thing is massive crutch for u, curious to know what it is,
He’s basically turned into a responsible older guy..  I just got my first waterpik, they make portable ones now which I think is neat. Loved Wendy and the fact you have all those markers. Very caring about his fans 👍🏻
been a fan of his and the rest of the jackass crew since i was a kid. would love to meet this dude one day.
Bootleg George clooney
Thank you Steve-O for the shout out for mental health awareness!
Without his tattoo of the baby getting *** ? Google Steve O baby tattoo
I’m watching you. Help me prevent World War 3!!! Help me make the Universal Basic Income happen today!!!!
Steve-O and Adam Carolla look very similiar.
What's up with this guy..
No one cares about a washed up drug head that glorifies drug use
The back scratcher might be easier to replace if he calls it a shower brush instead.
I like the shirt
glad zoloft works for stevo cause it ruined me and i have yet to find a med to help
Steve-O is truly my hero
“This is for you guys” 😂😂
Steve O has managed to make himself and Jackass overrated mainstream garbage
Drugs
I’m so happy he got sober!
i love you steveo
love him
Why am i watching this. Gave up after 2 mins
Wendy is by Far his #1
I would love to see 10 things Kim k can’t live without, it would be so iconic
Went to a standup show of his in Chicago. He literally stayed hours after the show and took a picture/signed autographs for anyone who wanted one completely free! Definitely a genuine guy
All Steve-O needs to do is search up shower scrubber on Amazon and probably find the exact same one or something super similar 😂
I don't think that's a back scratcher he can replace, since its used to scrub your body not scratch it 🤣
Rappers: “can’t live with out my thousands of dollars and my diamond jewellery”  Steve O: “I got markers, wanna see my dickagraph?”
Steve-O seems like the coolest guy. He’s definitely been through a lot but he seems to keep bettering himself because of it.
I adore this man
I love Stev-O.
Even though I love this guy but can't deny that he has the most punchable face ever.
Does anyone know what lights he uses when he shows his studio kit?
When he took that tooth out it Brings back so many memories
So we need zoloft
I only wish I could achieve his level of post drug addiction
I get pissy when I notice my back scratcher isn't within reach. Lol.
All my youth, and my first years as an adult. Hope he’s ok, and still be sober. White heart!
This really warmed my heart. We all love you Steve-O <3
I like how he’s still so badass that he swallows his floss water
Legend
Steve-O I remember when you participated in the Gumball 3000 Rally back in 2001.you slept through the entire rally LOL.the Jackass crew took a minivan and a jaguar 😆🤣
I love this dude so much man 🤣🤣
ayyyoooo steeeveee ooooo
Zolf Addict
Can we do justin bieber
I love that Wendy was number one! Love to see you so healthy and happy Steve-O......I went to the Swap Shop Circus in Ft Lauderdale many times back in the day, I wish that I had seen you there.
Love Steve 0 then and love who he is 2day alot of growth he is awesome
It's STEVE-OOOOOOO!!!!!!
So respectfully Steven?! Why Bam can’t have the same lifestyles? And be on jackass? I didn’t watch it because of that drama. I don’t agree with you guys dropping him like that brothers till then end? He lost a best friend. No matter how bad he got. You guys should of had some support not just drop him. I know it’s hard to watch I’ve lost friends to that lifestyle. Maybe that movie would have straightened out him at least alittle. Maybe not. You can’t abandon your brothers . My opinion that was a bad move.
This guy is pretty much the best thing America (or actually England) has ever produced. A heart of gold and such a great sense of humor.
Hurting himself is the answer
Love this and Wendy is the best!!! 💜🙌🏻❤️
10 sponsors that Steve-O can’t live without
The 🐐
I love steveo so much
Are you a stuntman, comedian, an author, actor, etc?  Steve-O: *YES*
That also is my go to coffee mug
Please do pro skateboarder Neen Williams!! 🥺😅
Who else came here just for Wendy??🙋‍♂️ I love that girl so much and want to give her so many hugs and kisses.
0:00 that phrase itself describes literally like 99.96% of influencers
Could anyone please tell me what those Sony cameras are?  Please!
What a kind gentleman im sure his past was about studying a lot and have a lot of degrees!
Like this for Wendy 🐕
Steve's an idol
I want his teeth
Steve-O the goat ♥️💯 glad to see him doing well
just pass out drunk in empty beer cans scratches by back all the time
What does he get out his suitcase that hangs up!?
These are "actual" essentials, not the diamond chains and watches we see at times.
I always thought it was weird that he had super perfect teeth.
He looks like Adam carolla
Number one: attention  Number two: cocaine
They didn't mention talking (non-stop) or interrupting other people talking with his talking .
so he will kill himself if he doesnt have it..?
Such a role model.
I just came here to see DA DOGGY
I love Steve O I was small watching your videos when I was like 4 or 5 😂🔥🔥
Wendy #1
Steve o is truely a legend
So happy to see him doing well and talking openly about sobriety and his mental health. I was one of those millions of people who watched him meet and fall in love with Wendy. Amazing that he turned out to be an incredibly wholesome human.
I want he's baby
OH MY GOD I LOVE WENDY
How about your girl lux
He's clean and sober, he just has to regularly take powerful anti-depressants every day now...
Wendy is precious
I'm so happy for Steve-O. What a great dude.
More dirty than usual in the movie More clean than usual behind the scene
1:55 makes me wanna lose a teeth, idk why but i love how steve-o looks... there's smth about it, so handsome and goofy
I met Steve o at a car show about 10 years ago. I have his autograph on a receipt and never getting rid of it
Athletic greens? Waterpik? Is this an ad?
Do I can't imagine how the GQ caramel looked at him when he took off his tooth lol
If GQ did one for Bam Margera it would just be one thing:   Drugs.
Yeah Dude!
I like how he called a god an “item” 😂
This is just a 8 minute long add
I'm so proud of SteveO  Keep up that clean and sober life man.
Steve o is the man.
Wendy was so little before this
where can i buy that water flosser?
Seeing him so happy and healthy gives me such joy
I have that same thermos 😆

Very interesting. Thank you for sharing  If your reading this I hope you have a great day and know. “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16‬ ‭NIV
gotta love Steve-O
One of the most unique speaking voices I’ve ever heard.
Steve-O is such an awesome dude. Stoked to see him sober and thriving
best one by far
He’s suddenly relevant again
It’s cool seeing him be happy in love with his dog Wendy
Love seeing positive comments for steve-o , spread the love
This man is absolute legend
This guy Steevo man is a true national treasure
4:33 how much for that piece of paper?
This is so pure
He shoulda been a skateboarder
Did he just swallow the pick water lol yikes actually he swallowed a goldfish and threw it up so nvm guess that’s normal for him lol
GQ is way better than the JQ
So steve-o hasn't been sober; Zoloft is technically a drug, even if it is a doctors prescription.
What's crazy, I've just seen the new Jackass Forever movie
Casually calls Wendy an item at the end
Crack
#1: life insurance
What a great ad GQ 🙄
All of these gqs are ads
I'm only here for Wendy, the best most awesome dog ever.
Idk who dis is but he I’d a gamer boy
What a legend !!!
Wee man once went to a bar saw a good lookin lady at the bar standing and he got a chair stood on it and gave her a kiss and that lady was my mom I couldn’t be more serious
Ohh Wendy <3
that steve-o guy remember him? yeah he fell off. all jokes aside,  mad stoked to see clean healthy steveo
Watching this, I'm thinking "this man really takes care of himself". Then I see his three cameras and I'm wondering "Why does this man not have a YouTube channel?" Wait...(searches Youtube for Steve-O.) Win.
So humble and honest! 💕
STEVE O WHAT WAS THE CAMERA STORE IN DC ;______;
Can’t feel anything but happiness for this man
I remember watching the documentary they did about his drug use. I’m glad to see he’s still sober after all this time and can joke about his shortcomings.
I've seen Steve-O's comedy show about three or four years ago and the man is so sweet and humble. Getting sober truly made a difference in the man's life and he definitely takes Wendy everywhere. It makes my heart so happy to see him getting attention and praise!
It's kind of funny how you get to climb a statue but no one else can enable to get slapped but jail time but you just got slapped on the wrist Celebrities should not get special privileges like you
How did all this fit on his carry on
If you did this 15 years ago it would have been a VERY different video. I'm genuinely happy and hoping for his health and happiness like he's an uncle or something. We all have so much love for him.
i love steve o bro
I swear by waterpiks. I struggled with dental hygiene for the first quarter of my life and still do. After years of abuse traditional picks cause a lot of inflammation and pain which means I stop doing it. The waterpick doesn't hurt and it's also kinda flashy and makes me feel rich even though I'm well below the poverty line
Shout out to Steve - O for mentioning his zoloft prescription.
We freakin LOVE you STEVE-O!! Super happy you got sober and have maintained. Congrats! :)
I’ve found that Zoloft takes the edge off of my depression. Prozac straight up got rid of the depression, but turned me into a couch potato zombie, which made the switch to Zoloft feel really scary because all my depression seemingly came back. But I think Zoloft is kind of perfect for actually helping you come to terms with being able to LIVE with your depression, as opposed to making you SLEEP AWAY your depression. Anyway, big love for you Steve O x
The story of Steve-O and Wendy is one of my fave things of all time.
Anybody know what luggage/organization hang system he has?
Boring
I absolutely adore SteveO
Fr clicked this thinking it was jim carrey
Finally someone who’s not here to brag but to really show his essential things!
A xanax mix 😂😂
I came here just to see Wendy ❤
Check yo privilege.
Man got 4k cameras to catch himself in 4k
Doggo :)
You cannot stop a man who brings his dog everywhere
😳🤯!!!  https://youtu.be/qFYK6pTqR0A
shill
what song is at 1:10 ??? I've heard this track before, kinda like this music
big fan of him since like forever
1 thing Steve-O CAN live without: all of his teeth
Wendy seems a little pissed
Wendy is so cute
My uncle looks almost just like Steve-O
GQ hear me out, Rob McElhenney?
thumbs up on the mental health part
I plan to meet you bro ! It’s for my bucket list
go hard Steve O you always have love Wendy she's like my boy Otis funny bull terrier winning show bruz
i came here for Wendy <3
He uses an ecollar on her, he electrocutes that dog if she doesn’t listen. That’s probably why she looks so docile on his lap. He’s full of crap and he exploits and abuse that dog for fame. I have no respect for him. You can see it here -> https://youtu.be/ms2ipiatwfs
Wendy and Steve-O are my favorite duo
Love you stevo! Can’t wait to see the movie soon!!!!!!!
The hot sauce is actually really good 👍🏽🔥
Wendy!
Steveo is the best.
We all know what bam can’t live without.
Surely this is the first one where someones brought a pet
Nonchalantly pulls his tooth😭
Love you Steve-O 💚
Desde Mayaguez te queremos
Didn’t know he took meds interesting
He forgot the nitrous
Steve-O doesn’t seem like the guy that would mediate lmao
those of you wondering (like I was) what kind of carry-on that is, it looks like a Solgaard Carry On Closet. It comes with the folding storage thing
This dude drank his floss water
The sound of his voice makes my skin crawl. Reminds me of the sugar water guy on MIB
Ohhhh Wendy❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
looks like Steve-O wants all the attention because his daddy didn't love him enough
Can someone please tell my the brand of those portable lights. Those are awesome!
Joe rogans athletic greens AG1😂
someone needs to tell him thares a terabyte sd cards that can hold 4x the one he has
Controversial opinion: Steve o was cooler when he was on drugs
Steve-o Zoloft saved my life too. So I feel you on that.
My exs stepdad was his tour guide while he was in our town, and he said that Steve-o was a genuine, funny, very polite, pleasant and nice person to be around :)
Even cuter sober
0:07 I thought he was going to say “I’m a jackass” but then he disappointed me smh 🤦‍♂️
I would have like too see his essentials in 06
Ngl I seriously thought that thermos was a fleshlight and I thought: ”That makes sense”.
That dog is so chill ❤
Haha, i knew he had false teeth! you can tell it a mile away! i thought he would have more than 1 though.
I thought he was a jackass I didn't know he was a comedian
such a legit dude
at least he's honest about himself not everyone is like that
Wait wait Wendy is not an item you take that back! 😡
Best one ever
I swear there's not a single Jackass member that isn't a sweetheart Steve-O is just the freaking best Stay gnarly!
My dude Steve-O!!! Love him!!!!!
i have no idea who this guy is ,,
Love me some Steve-0o he such a cool white guy!!!!😂
I 💕🐕Wendy
OMG, those teeth!, I thought with how pearly white they were they ALL had to be fake, he talks about how he didn’t really take care of his teeth during all the years of drug use and such, and with all the stunts I figured he would have lost most of them over time, but nope, just the one.  Those teeth are awesome.
go watch steve os videos so entertaining
i absolutely love steveo
where drugs?
all this product placement tho, americans lmao
Dude my dad has the same Cup
Is this video brought to you by Pfizer, Waterpik and Bluetooth Speaker manufacturer. BUY NOW BUY NOW BUY NOW
Isn’t that backscratcher just a scrubbing brush? 😅😅
zoloft gang
fr the goat
I cried when he brought out number 1. What an amazing human being.
Zoloft commercial
Happy, down to earth and living his best life. Stone cold Sober Stevo!
The xanax joke got me
He forgot to mention how his hot sauce got the name… it’s what you would expect lol
Stev o Zoloft done me dirty my man, I would recommend 0.1 to 0.2 mg of psilocybe mushrooms every few days, life hasn't been the same since :)
1. Attention
“and evidently xanax mix” LMAO 😂
I feel like My voice got heavier For some reason.....
We all love you Steve-O!
Seriously ironic that he takes zoloft. SSRIs are known to be very addicting
Steveo can’t live without fatal injuries
The song at 1:12 is OTE - Pretty Funk
Is it just me or does everything feel like there just trying to sell you something I mean literally everything like the world's an ad
1-10: Being sober. Whoopsie!!!
Met Steve-O in the Jack n the Box on Cahuenga and Sunset in 2007. He was strung out in the bathroom. Wasn’t his happy self. I’m so very happy to see him in his current state. God bless Steve-O
Why is this so cute
You definitely got my attention,  love & respect for rescuing Wendy!👍🇨🇦
Steve O you rule
Sweet Steve o and his dog
Oooft Zoloft is not for me I rather feel anything than nothing at all
Wow I have the same brand of thermos
That carry on luggage . He covered everything but that carry on luggage he keeps it all in . That things dope n I want it
Me wondering if Zoloft owners paid stevo for this.. Then realizing this is America and going back to sleep.
Steve-o is an entertainer. He will entertain no matter the medium! Love the dude for it!
Steve-O = Million Dollar Man
Love your dog! I can’t imagine life without a family 🐶
Anyone know the brand of the waterpik? Can't find it lol really want one
Thank You for laughs Steve-O all these years.
He’s come such a long way.
How this  guy hasn't made a serious breakthrough into Hollywood to become a major film star is beyond me.
Love this guy. Much respect to who he's grown to be. Proud of em.🤙🏽
I needed this 15 years ago
When you take the same anxiety medication as Steve-O
Can't wait to watch the movie
I am the same age as Steve os back scratcher
Was anyone else waiting for Wendy to make an appearance the whole vid?? She’s the goodest girl 🥺
Hes such a down to earth guy, I love Steve-o
“It’s called Zoloft man!” Yasss!
Gotta meet him one day
Give this man an AG sponsorship
Mans getting paid to push zolaf the water stuff and he pushing his hit Sauce Lol Steve o said ina get addicted to money now
He's starting to look like Adam Carolla lol
What lights were those?
Steve-O you're the most awesome dude of all time.
Food? Water? No. Back scratcher
wheres' the weed  ?
This dude rocks!
Every time I see him I think he has to be the most-“lived” human being in history. Seriously, he’s gone everywhere, and he’s don’t everything. And that’s something he said when he took a Russian fighter jet to the edge of space way back when Wildboyz was on, he’s down so much since then. I seriously can’t think of one single individual who has experienced more than Steve-O. And he’s had a totally amazing attitude everywhere he’s gone. I certainly wish I could live like that, but I don’t think I’m wired that way unfortunately. I don’t know how he does it, but if he were to catalog every travel or experience in general, he’s done and seen so much more than anyone, I’d bet. What an inspiration.
Yeah dude !
Wendy ♥
That dog is iconic
Steve-O and the rest of the jackass gang are the only attention whores who will be well respected.
number 11. drugs
what's that song that starts at 6:24
Steve -O legend!
The hot suace is surprisingly good on nachos and bloody marrys
A drone is way more essential than a dog
ZOLOFT GANG
the light ??????anyone know what brand?
Calling Miss Wendy a Xanax mix is so sweet
Yeaaaa Dude!!!
I’m so happy I went to see his stand up and got to take a photo with him. He was so nice to every single person
Legend
Ha
Ah
This guy is like one of people who we will never gonna forget for all of that stuff he managed to make us laugh with his comics apparently, it makes me wanna say that this man deserves a medal of on what he's doing like IMMIDEATLY.
Im going to see Jackass Forever tomorrow.
Love the pup
Any ideas on where to get those lights?
GQ pushing 🅿️
Wendy is indeed magical. Amazing what a animals love can do
I’m 18 and I grew up watching Steve-o and I must say I still love the guy
Dang steve-o your old but still rad
Love Steve 0 so much
Nitrous oxide
i have stevos autograph  good man
he should try to and fail
The F happened to his voice?
Zoloft is literally the essential item
Omg I used to be on Zoloft
One of the weirdest men to ever walk planet earth XD
the 🐐
Remember y'all: You wouldn't make fun of a diabetic for using insulin - medication can be an important tool to help us be who we truly are. Really cool to see Steve-O be genuinely health and happy.
Sh1t...steve O has grown old...and I remember when he was younger than I am now...
cocaine
I love Wendy lol
Steve o legend
its genuinely impressive how hes sober now, i dont think i could quit weed completely and he quit basically everything, respect
If your reading this then your a good person and if you dislike this comment then your even a better person.
Love you, stevooo❤️
Number 1: *Oxygen*
Steve-o's hot sauce is legit amazing on burritos! It's like super spicy salsa
I love Steve-O. Met him in Philadelphia such a genuine guy. This was the most in depth essentials video i have ever seen! These companies should all give him something for endorsing.
2:02 and you drink that all
Glad he's still alive 🙏🙏🙌
zoloft! 😊 lulz
Steve o is my spirit animal
Lol ive had the same thermos for years its the best. Stuff stays hot or hold in it for mad long too like ive found ice water in it after leaving it in a hot car for like an entire day and over night. Forget where i got it tho i think Walmart? Contigo, ive seen similar ones like Royal Farms sells and those always suck.
Steve-o starting to look like a mob guy
A water pick isn’t actually a replacement for flossing though. Also Zoloft really helps me too! 😊
Does anyone know the name of those 2 lights that he uses?
Really disappointing he still needs drugs to be happy
I remember listening to him on Joe rogans podcasts about his life rehab the lot. What a crazy life this guy has lived and couldn’t be happier that he’s making his millions
Anyone know what brand shirt Steve-O has on?
Steve-O is one of the most beautiful men ever created
i need his back scratcher!!!
Dog life change
I've wanted to meet steve o for so long. Dude seems so cool
Love steveo so much man
what camera does he have?
I love how he didn’t even do a movie plug in that’s how you know his intentions are genuine
Great job 👏
Why are the americans so soft so much meds and Supplements just poor
It's on my bucket list to meet you one day man
steve-o's essentials are more organized then my whole life
The back scratcher
Pre zoloft... badass..post zoloft... toiletries are very important to me...
I didn’t see cocaine on that list…just kidding! Glad he got sober. He’s 10 times better. You know people tell you that, “you better sober” and it’s hard to see it or feel that way when you are but you can see it with him. Glad he reached a place where he loves life and enjoys sobriety. Keep it going Steve-O!
Anyone know a website I could watch jackass 4 on?
Love Steve-o, but did he just swallow the water he used to clean his teeth with? I feel sick.
This dude is just very likable :) Love the doggy at the end.
Jackass Forever was basically exactly what I expected and it was GREAT. Watching it puts you back to a simpler time.
Yo I have that same thermos. It really is a good one
Remember kids don't do drugs
Go wendy
Steveo turning into prime Casey Neistat
he’s one of the most relatable celebrities to ever walk the earth, everyone needs a Steve-O type person in their life
Contigo make the best drinks cannisters. I have gone through so many different ones over the years and Contigo's are the best. Sounds like a weird comment but its true.
Seeing Steve-O make a complete 180 to being his healthiest self is so inspiring.  We’re all proud of you, man!
I like that he’s honest.
can I get a link / brand / model number on that water pik?
replaces cocaine with 24oz of coffee
Steve o caught in 4k
Lo mejor que han tenido en GQ🎈
i take the same pills stevie.
I love sober SteveO 😍 he gives me hope for others sucked into addiction
Refreshing to see that Steve-O and I share the same coffee cup
1. Attention 2. Making everything about him
"I don't use drugs"  Drinks alot of coffee....
He has a podcast it's great
No I think Steve and the rest are backstabbers. Bam helps all these punks out and they just drop him. Glad Bam came out good at court. So kids don't forget to watch the movie online. Just stream it
mf really brought his dog 💀💀💀
Steve O makes me feel better about taking my anti depressant medication. Kinda sucks, but can't live without it
This man is a true former addict. But has not become dependent upon new essentials. 🤔
Next we need Trevor Bauer
Dam he aged quick
"She's a Belgian Malinois and evidently Xanax mix"🤣🤣🤣
"It's called Zoloft, man"  Felt steve-o, felt. I love you, man and I'm glad you're doing well.
Surprised health insurance isn’t on the list
All the new movie is missing is Tom Green
I always thought that cup was a fleshlight
Oh yeah, me too. High five for Zoloft lol.
Wendy proves there is a dog for everyone. She's super chilled.
Dam steve o look like he'll
When he removed his fake teeth lol
Best man ever ❤️
Steve a real one
definitely no product placement here..
When the Chef was gonna cook him up 😂😂 Steve O came a long way
Aww Wendy, that is so cute of Steve-O
For those people who have been there like myself and defeated it can relate. Respect to steve 0 and to all who are still struggling. You can do it!
Wendy 💖🥰
It’s funny he said his malinois is zanex mixed cause I swear their is no way mine could sit still that long 😂
YEAH DUDE!!!!!🤙 You guys have healed an entire nation with laughter.  May your bones suffer no more and no less🤞😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😚😙😘😗😏😶😚
I take Zoloft and seraquill too
He is a saint
those aren't even his own teeth....they're implants or something....he lost own teeth a looooong time ago...
the dog will eventually die someday
Love this dude and the coolest dog
Steve-O just talking about hot sauce is making my mouth watery
The dog looks pissed
sure johnny is rich and all can buy expensive pure bred dogs  but non of that arent interested since wendy came along johnny changed his life
This is the most authentic thing I've ever seen on the internet.
They can’t be real💀💀
This man started off in clown school...
Apparently I have the same coffee cup as steveo
Watched jackass yesterday it was hilarious Man this man is wild bzzzz 🐝🐝🐝🐝
what’s the link to the water pik
Wendy is a star
Steve-O signed “paper” is on sale for only $99,999
Okay this dude can bring a dog in  Yet Yungblud couldn't ?   https://youtu.be/vnm0_-GvZZ8
Sounds like a drug given by the government 👍🏽
🤣🤣
When u realize non of his choices were his wife😂.
When I saw Steve o hasld to click
In the beginning when his dog is on his lap she was so still I thought a taxidermy of his dog was on his list
Same with me steve-o. I can’t live without meth. Without it, my mind goes to dark places too. Thank you to the psychiatrist that I found on the street
Is it just me or is Steve O looking more and more like Adam Corolla?
I take  Zoloft it’s for anxiety and adhd
Who is Steve-O
Xanax mix 😂😂😂
What were those Light cubes that Steve-O had in his camera equipment?
Ayo what's that thermos where do I get one 👀
Zoloft is not a narcotic btw, full steam ahead my sober brother
Wendyyyyyyyyyyyyy :D
This just feels like one big giant advertisement
This dude is a warrior in modern times
It seems like Steve-O forgot he was doing this and just whipped out whatever he had in his hotel room.  "A tooth brush, toiletry, back scratcher, prescriptions, and my tooth." 🤣🤣
Still can't believe how much steve-O changed
This ones been a long time coming
Those things are usually rappers flexing bs things. Steve O is just as real as it gets he is awesome
sertraline gang let's go
Wendy is essential
what are those camera s?
#11 a baby gator clipped onto his balls
I'm taking bupropion for my anxiety and depression, I have severe anxiety and depression, if you need something ask for this as well^ it works
Why would you do this to meee
Awesome
Steveo rocks
Steve-O 👍👍👍❤️ so glad he living his life to the fullest and taking care of himself. He keeps it 💯 that's what I like about him 😎👍
Man it's so good to see Steve-O doing so good, every time I see him he's always positive and happy.
I've loved him over half my life. I swear he's only become more lovable. Forevermore
0:07 me too ‼️‼️
I'm so glad he got sober. Man, I wish Bam would follow his lead.
Bro Steve-O in like 2000 2002 would have just pulled out a luggage full of cocaine
Man that is impressive camera equipment and set up.
love
What exactly camera lights are these? Thank you for answering :)
I am happy to see Steve-O meditating and getting his mental health in order. All that trauma he's been through with Jackass and his personal life. Way to go Steve-O 👏
That’s not a backscratcher mate, that’s a back scrubber.
always loved Steveo, but now he is my hero!
He seems kinda outta it
He forgot Crack
Tldr Steve just flogging a bunch of adverts
Great  pick
Wendy needs her own channel. Queen.
Watching the bond between steve-o and Wendy was one of the best things I've ever seen on the internet. So happy for them both. It's gonna be the worst day in the world when that incredible girl goes :( ... K this went dark sorry.
If someone asked me if Steve-O was a comedian or stuntman, I would say he is a professional jackass
The name of his hot scauses are hilarious
My back scratcher is a back scratcher BUT I duck taped a hair brush to it and I use that side 😂
Awww wendy
We need mr beast here
Love you Steve-O. What a guy!!
Only clicked this video cuz I saw Wendy
So glad to see Steve-O is doing well <3
Love you Steve-O.  Thanks for changing your life style but not your personality.
Who else click on the video just to type "who?"
His voice is irritating
Close your eyes. Whoopi Goldberg is at GQ
Sick
Most importantly, eugenics. Steve-O is a big eugenics proponent!
I love stevo😢
I like steve but he’s a walking ad now
Wendy forever
Him being open with the antidepressants is awesome. It’s true, some people have too much goin on up there and too much of a negative tendency to keep their head on straight. Some of us need Zoloft and that’s okay hahahaa
I think it's important to note how many things he does for his mental and physical health - he doesn't just take Zoloft, he also eats well, drinks water first thing in the AM, supplements, exercise and has his dog, not to mention his spiritual development and meditation. It's never just one thing that prompts change or health in general, at least in my experience. There may be a single catalyst, but cultivating and maintaining takes many facets of a complete lifestyle etc. Steveo kills it.
The fact that Steve O considers sharpies to sign autographs as an essential item is too cool for words.
super nice video.
I picked up a bottle of his hot sauce when I saw his stand up and I gotta say, its actually way better than I thought it was going to be.
Wendy looks just like my dog she's a German Shepard malinois mix
I remember stevo 13 years ago, now he's a millionaire! Steve-O is a roach who won't die
None of these things are really essential to him. He's just playing this channel. I'm glad you're still alive stevo
As a former addict myself who is on anti depressants, it's cool to know that he's still able to have his sense of humor and to share this stuff with us to show he's just a regular dude. Nothing about him comes off as rich and fake. I also have lost teeth so I know that's not fun to share with the world, either.
Me and Zoloft get along just fine. I'm on the same meds Steve. It helps
W
Do the insane clown posse
he is a sweetheart
I’m the 1000th comment
-Things Steve-o can't live without -brings out a box of cocaine
Knowing that Steve-O takes Zoloft makes me feel so much better about the years ive also been on Zoloft. Thanks man, you rock👊
He’s an Entertainer!
The Fuccin backscratcher 😂
Best intro to one of these ever
Lol I take zoloft too
Such a good dude. Love his dog too!
we love you Steve-O
Hmm… has a toiletry kit as essential but no first aid kit
< 3 3 3
Hi Steve-0 ! Stay healthy be happy be appreciative of what you got! It’s been a wild week for me…   I have a waterpik that thing is awesome 😎
i enjoyed his essentials fr
Umm,
The only thing that can take my head out of a dark place is my girlfriend.
Hey I have a fake tooth in the same place and I take zoloft too! We should be friends Mr. Steve O!
How can you not live Steve o
He's the friend we all want
So around 2 years ago it was july 22nd it was my birthday and i was having the worst day ever i live in the 757 so i was in town center i look to the right of me and i see steveo in a building after his show i had no clue he was in town i was so happy he let me take a picture with him dude made my year I always think abt that moment
What lights are those?
Okay this ag1 is everywhere all of a sudden
love dis motherfuker
I thought it was crack. Lol.
son of Satan? come on steve ! you can still come back to Jesus..he's waiting for you..you can do these in his name and be blessed
I like how all his stuff is actually used
thats the shirt he was wearing when i met him :)
Just seen Steve-O on tour in Columbus, Ohio and legit amazing dude. He even stayed after to take a picture with everyone who wanted one. Gave a skateboard away also during the show. Such a nice guy
Steve O is amazing!! So proud of him ❤️
I need to see a Johnny Knoxville 10's things i can't live without it VIDEO.
I need a dog like Wendy in my life.
Athletic greens should pay him for that promo haha
man i've been taking Zoloft/Sertraline for 10 years now! After i got assaulted 2 times..! Man didn't thought you where on the hardest "drug" for the brain!
I'm curious: why a waterpick instead of flossing?
awesome dog
How he’s still alive is nothing short of Devine intervention
Greatest thumbnail in the history of GQ’s 10 essentials!
Wow no idea he was on Zoloft.  Really cool he was honest about that
I want a waterpick now 😂😂😂
Wendy!
AG1 is everywhere lol
steve-o is such a handsome and interesting person.
Somebody tell Steve-O he’s actually looking for a scrubber for the shower
*I'm sorry to offend anyone but this is the best one ever.*
Absolute legend of a man. Who would have thought he would turn out to be such a wholesome and inspiring chap in sobriety? His podcast is brilliant too.. a man of many 'talents' who deserves every penny he makes.
What kind of lights does he use that he showed
Would've loved to see this list 15 years ago lmfao
most well behaved dog I've ever seen
The fact this guys lived such a massive rock and roll lifestyle, his essentials are pretty boring and tame really lol
Steve-O is the absolute best! Absolutely deserves everything in life!!
Ever since Steve O stopped with all the partying and craziness it's like no one gives a fk because he so boring and not entertaining. But in real life we not here to entertain anybody. That's what the clowns are for.
Gq got Steve o to do a Zoloft advertisement . So sad
“Give me that Z...O-L-O-F-T...”
Love you Wendy ❣️🤙
Steve-O for President
They better pay up my boy steve o. For the add  Now Im buying some of that ag1 drinks.
This guy is an absolute beauty and a great example for people struggling with addiction. Basically made jackals what it is. Thank you sir
He’s about to be here in Hattiesburg,MS super excited🤙🏽
knowing steve-o, i couldve sworn the AG1 was condoms lol
The last essential is an absolute gem ❤
Lol when he took his tooth out!!🤣🤣
My favorite one yet!!
Thank you Steve-O for being a MAJOR part of my childhood 🙏🏿
Love this man. He’s so happy and content. Love to see it!
*Steve-O is a LEGEND*
Jackass forever !!!!!!!!
So glad you got your life sorted out and found a way to really live. Wendy is so frickin beautiful.
Wendy always blowing it up 💨💩🤣🤘💯
When I was younger I used to hate the jackass, I don't like the stunts that they are doing, now that I'm older I realized that they became a part of my childhood memory. It never failed to make me smile whenever I saw the cast of the jackass esp. Steve O and the stupid tattoo of his face on his back. 😂
We love you Steve O but we really love Wendy!!
Love this man he shared his personal details. I take Zoloft and it does help. Seek help if you need it man mental health is key 🔑
Zoloft = Zoned out Loft
Think that back scratcher winked at me.
Wendy!
I love his relationship with Wendy
#1...Your dog, Wendy!
really enjoyed this
He sounds a lot better now.
His voice will forever make me happy 😊
I still wonder why steve-o sounds like he`s never cleared his throat
Best hot sauce
GQ publish!
He forgot his pickled onion Monster Munch 🤣 But in all seriousness I wish nothing but blessings and happiness for Steve-O. The man is borderline saintly.
One who finally started taking meds few years back you really don't realize how miserable you are till you do find something that helps . That would been my #1 thing cause everything else revolves around it .  Glad he has stayed on the right track so long .
I really hope Jackass isn’t why his anxiety issues got so bad. That much adrenaline can be a double-edges sword. But his voice sounds much better and he looks healthy. With this last movie I hope he can retire and live long and happy with his dog and iconic back scratcher.
I got the same coffee mug and it is absolutely essential and I'm glad I haven't lost mine either lol
I love his bond with Wendy, it's so precious
my boy steve-o
IDK how, but this is the best ESSENTIALS ever! No longer than any other, but so fulfilling. Thanks Steve-O.
Great video!
Steve-O, still one of, if not, the absolute coolest dude/s out there.
Who cares? This guy is brainless
I like how Steveo has been popping out his fake teeth haha.
zoloft is good, im off it now, but have it on stand by
Looks a lot like Johnny Knoxville now doesn't he?
Steve-O is the coolest guy ever. Humble, expressive, and a hero for all who struggle mentally. ♥️
I like Wendy 🙂
I can listen to his voice but Seth Rogen not so much.
Really wish they would stop animal abuse on jackass
Of course he has that hot sauce 🙄
Wowowooww
Wish I knew what model  those cameras were
So proud how far he has come
Steve o looking a lot like Adam Corolla
How tf is he still alive
Finally someone who do not count jewelery as essentials.
Idk how I feel about Steveo having the same back scratcher for 13 years
Only 1 Steve O
Steve o grew into such an inspirational, wholesome person. Such a cool guy with so many crazy stories. It’s hard to not love this man.
Just watched jackass forever tonight, great movie.  Sad in a way because that’s the last of the guys together we’ll ever see but great way to go out.  Stunts were just as good as back in the day.
#LuvWendy
Crazy how he got sober and Bam fell off.
Zoloft huh
Belgian Malinois make for the best companions
I love that he included his dog, Wendy.
Crack
Steve-O is the man.
So authentic I love it🤟
My mom has that exact same thermal cup💀 she loves it.
The fact he brings his markers around shows how much he actually cares about his fans.
Love Steve 0 Jackass was a huuge part pf my childhood, My mom hated it! haha
Wendy and Steve was seriously meant to be the dynamic duo Wendy keeps Steve grounded
Wendy's face is so done, she is like, "dude really? AGAIN???"
i’m happy that he’s doing so good for himself yet he’s still the same idiot we all love
I love steveo
Thank you Steve-O for opening up on mental health. I’ve been on Zoloft for two years (I’m 24 years old) Before I didn’t think I was gonna have a normal life. I never left my room, hardly ate and thought everyone hated me. I grew up in a very destructive household. Now I’m loving life with a stable job and my own place. Life is beautiful keep going
Steve-O is the greatest
I just love his positive energy...
… did he really swallow that …
Wendy is probably the #1 superstar dog in the world since Lassie and Airbud
I wonder what old steve-o would've said in this vid, what a crazy turn around in this guys life.
Where's the leopard thong? Lol
Outstanding Steve-O I’m glad you’re well man
Call me Steve-O ima wild boy ima ima wild boy
Should be marked as an ad...
Steve-O I just got a little over 5 years clean and sober, I have watched almost everything I could find that you were in and I have to say you are a huge inspiration. I was so lost for over 10 years and your story's and everything you have been threw has helped me stay strong. I just wanted to say thank you, also is there any place that you sell signed merchandise?
Smooth seas don’t make good sailors.
2:00 between teeth ?,  you don't have even microcaps naturally, because of fake teeth
"I'm attetion wh**e", what a honesty!
Great ad for zoloft
Anyone notice how well Steve's voice is doing since he started doing that vocal therapy?
The Dickograph lol
He’s definitely lived a full life lol. Exhibit A:”I had a great experience at a camera store in WA DC. It was the same day I got arrested for climbing the Lincoln memorial.” 😂
8min of merchandise
SteveO is YouTube essential. Hopefully I meet you someday in life. India awaits you
The legend
Where is cocaine
Steve-O the new jackass movie was hilarious. But what happened to the shark bit with poopies ? That wasn’t in the movie :(
Seeing Steve-O in good health and staying sober brings me joy. Been watching Jackass since ‘03, so watching him be happy and healthy makes me happy for him
hot sauce is still sold out!
I love wendy ❤️
Great choice with the peak design backpack
I love this dude. He’s legitimately inspiring to anyone looking to turn themselves around and change for the better without ever compromising who they are. He is who he is, but he’s much wiser, healthier, and ultimately more endearing, I think.
#1 is his cheetah thong
So genuine! 🔥
Steve-Of-AllTrades
It’s funny how drastically different Zoloft can be for people. I’ve been prescribed it twice in my life, once as a kid and again in my early 20s. As a kid, it put me in the darkest hole I’ve ever been in (which is saying something, considering I was prescribed it AFTER a serious attempt to end it all 😂). As an adult, it just made me unfathomably sleepy/exhausted.   Meanwhile, many other people feel they can’t function without it.  Brain chemistry is weird 😐
Missing something
Now this is refreshing, real and super entertaining. I am so glad you survived sniffing wasabi to bring more joy to the world. ❤️
I had a pretty wild life. Not as wild as these guys. But when I had to get sober I hated meetings. I knew I needed some sort of help, so I’d listen to Steve-o and Novak and I would tell myself if they were this bad and are clean now I know I could do it. Would listen to these guys talk about addiction for hours.
Cant help but love Steve O
His essentials rly age him 😂
sober steve-o is best steve-o
Stevie is a sell out ..I hope one day gets back into drugs
But wtf is wrong with his voice
Most wholesome man alive
I'm so confused right now. Did he just say he was sober while also saying he still takes drugs? 🤔 Just gna leave this right here.
Hot Sauce, just like Paul Newman's salad dressing!
the dog❤️
He looks healthy now. I'm happy for him
Johnny Knoxville and Steve-O were my 2 favorites
He can't replace the back scratcher because it's a body scrubber for showers lol
4 cameras ready we aint missing a thing lol
Steve-O is one of my favorite people of all time. I’ll never not like him.
stay cool steve
Respect for the Zoloft!
One observation: That insulated drink container is not a Thermos, it says Contigo right on the side.
can we get willem dafoe essentials???
Steveo comes out with a video:   Comments: it’s great to see him sober and happy.   We get it, he’s sober and has been for almost 20 years, let’s talk about something else.
Dog was the best part of this video 📹
Who would've thought that all those years of fckin' up and making wrong decisions would make you a celeb and earn millions that would set you up for life? And here I am studying in a university to become a doctor.
would have been hilarious if they did one of these back in the Wild Boyz Days
Was soo hoping to see the doggo!!
I love how open and honest stevo is
So open and honest of him to tell us about his anxiety and using zoloft, I've just started taking it again for the second time as I struggle with anxiety and having dark thoughts, it's so reassuring to see people like Steve O openly speak about it
Y’know steveo’s a real one when he’s bringing up zoloft as a positive.
If you close your eyes and listen to Steve-O talk, you think it's Whoopie Goldberg.
Steve is a LEGEND But the back scratcher looks like it stinks tho... 😂
I use the same coffe thermos!!! this is for sure not going to spill!!
Steve-O became one of my favorite personalities although I grew up in the 90’s and at that time I thought he wasn’t that nice!  Now the guy is sober e truly an honest person… keep it up SteveO
This man has come so far, and it really is a success story. Something, at least for me, people can look at and say "if Steve-O can get his mental health together I can too!"
Steve-o is awesome iv met him twice after his shows and he will literally stay until everyone has gotten a picture and autograph that wants one super genuine guy
Honestly the most well thought out appearance on this channel
Wendy is amazing and Steveo is even more amazing for having rescued her
I feel a little uneasy seeing him age because that means I’m old now too
Wendy is awesome. She’s so chill. Steve-o and Wendy definitely found each other for a reason. Clearly meant to be. That’s dope.
My dr tried to give me zoloft and i diddent wanna take it even though i need something.   Uncle steve has never steered me wrong so ill schedule another appoitment and give it solid try
Wendy is the best girl
Good to see him sober and happy.
I really like Steve-o, but this was a bit too shameless of a commercial hyping his sponsors LOL dude is an absolute legend
What cameras he did use!?! Sony what!?!
The results are in and wiki has determined, you ARE an entertainer.
Steveo has to be the craziest wildman thats gotten sober and lived to tell the tale. Respect 💯
Steve is gunna live way longer than all those fat moms who hate him
jackass always gets popular when people are starved for authenticity
How candid Steve O is with everything is so inspiring. I feel like he truly does know himself, which is more than I can say for most people
I thought he found Wendy in morocco
This video is great because I can get all my YouTube ads at once instead of having them spread out over multiple videos
Steve, ... buddy, Wendy is not an item.
That is not a back scratcher. That is a wash brush.
I clicked just to see the dog
Haha! Wendy has a UFC collar😂
Best top 1 item ever! Also, I might need to get one of those water flosses.
Awwwwww Wendy ❤️❤️❤️❤️  Steve-O is just such cool dude, absolutely i like him. I am very proud of his sobriety.
❤️
I watched your show man!! Nice bees on the balls
Shot out to Wendy!
I'm afraid of Stevo- o relapsing 😭
The best of this series.
Steve-O is an inspiration to all
Cool dude period. Crazy but cool.
Proud of you brother.  A BIG INSPIRATION FOR ALOT OF PEOPLE.  WE ALL THANK YOU BROTHER STEVE
Zoloft really helped me to bro.
15 years ago his 10 essentials would be weed, booze, pills, blow, glass pipe, bong, lighters, condoms, nitrous, cigarettes
Wow. I think I need to get a few of those things for my anxiety myself. Steve-O is Such an inspirational dude <3
Wendy<3
Most authentic Episode
I swear I've seen that back scratcher at the dollar store , but, it's technically a back scrubber , well, when you shower obviously, but, the way Steve O uses it , I too would use it as back scratcher, I would rather uses bristles than wood.
Nice
stevo I love you!!!
This all feels like an ad and I love it
I love how you picked Wendy. Fantastic and best video you made
Love you Steve!
What exact camera is the one he uses all i know it’s the Sony 4k camera lol
Seeing steve-o’s show on Feb. 18
I mean that’s not a back scratcher but okie doke lol
I knew Wendy would would be no.1, she's a beautiful soul just as you are too 💗
I’m glad I live in the universe where Steve-o got his life together and inspires people to be better
zoloft tried to off me, good for you steve-o
I thought Steve-O was off drugs, guess not LOL.. You can't say you're sober on happy pills.
It’s so good to see Steve-O sober and healthy after all he’s been through. And for him to be as transparent as he is with his journey is really refreshing
I need a dog.......
Coolest dude in the world
SteveO lookig like Knoxville in my opinion
Man, if Steve-o can get sober and turn his life around Bam can too.
Smoke some weed
I am watching this waiting for the Jackass Forever previews to end
I don’t watch rappers top 10 but I will watch Steve 0s
Steve o’s the best
Out of all the people who’ve come on here everything he says he needs actually seems legit
I love this episode very relatable stuff. Even though he can afford much more pricey things he maintains down to earth.definitely one of the better episodea
I don’t get the joke about the malinois and Xanax.
He didn't mention that they tell you to use a water pick when you get dental implants.
Jesus Loves Yall And Is The Way To Everlasting Life 🤍🤍🤍
Anyone know what lights those are ?
That's not a back scratcher
In those southern america continents it's normal to see dogs wonder around the streets because people out there are filthy just like in certain poverty areas in china. So I'm glad steve o took the dog in
WEEEEEEENDY!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Just keeping it real thanks much for sharing GQ
I have a lot of respect for Steve-O for the man he's become. Yeah, dude!
That’s a nice shirt stivo
We all love wendy
Wish every person who is struggling with whatever problems, can turn there life around as much as Steve o has. Shows it's possible for anyone. Steve O was saved by his friends but if you are alone you have to take the first step yourself.
Drug free takeing pills to live don't sound to sober
anyone know what those camera lights are called?
Steve-o is so positive he makes my mood better every time I see a video of him
Anyone know what kind of lights those are?
If Zoloft is ssri I wonder if he can replace it with mushroom as an alternative eventually
I bet a thousand dollars steve o looked to see if his episode has the most views lol
The jackass guys are doing well with the promotion for the new movie !
What’s the name of that clothes hanger he hs
Imagine doing this video 10-15 years ago hahaha
I did not know he was missin a tooth
Wendy! 😭🤗
1:27
Hearing that Stev-o is taking Zoloft just made me feel really good about myself. I just started taking it two weeks ago for anxiety and depression, and I’ve kind of been scared about it since. But when someone like stev-o can say that they’re taking it and it’s helped him a lot, it makes me feel better.
I was gonna riot if Wendy wasn't number 1
Health Insurance
Saw that paper he signed on eBay
“And I send it to my girl”
Adam Corolla??
Steve O's 10 things he can t live without Drugs, alcohol, more drugs, more alcohol, money for drugs and alcohol. Drugs alcohol, money for rehab. More drugs, more alcohol, more money for drugs and alcohol. A little time in rehab. more drugs and alcohol. Money for drugs and alcohol.
How can you say youre sober and take zolaf and zanax?
what is that ? 1:38
The service dog part kind of undermines actual service dogs.
Maaaan, I also highly value my back scratcher lbvs 💯
#steveo you should come to NH or lower Maine
I love Wendy since ultimate expedition
So basically everything that sponsors his podcast 😂
This is a strange ad for Zoloft.
My back scratchers my wife
Anyone know where to score the lights? Have a brand or model?
I really love how he owns his flipper tooth. It really gives me a strong relation to him. I too am missing that same tooth, and wear a flipper tooth just like that! It's nice to see a celeb kind of owning it, it's like ahh yea. People are always telling me to get a bridge or a implant even thought my dentist doesn't advise it (bad for the neighboring teeth etc..). I love Steve-O lol
Watched the video with Wendy way back and viewed Steve-O in a whole new light afterwards. Bringing a dog into your life can be transformative. It was for me.
Biggest inspiration, man’s a goat
Zoloft is a dangerous SSRI and can lead to suicidal/homicidal psychosis in some people. No thanks.✋
Me and Steve o take Zoloft 💀
I love Steve O so much!! He looks so happy and healthy now!!
Gotta love Steve O's laugh
I remember Wendy was a pup
Ex druggie preaching prescription drugs
Love ya Steve-O
Steve-O is one of my favorite people I see on my screen
This was just an ad for all his products. Amazon links in the description. 😉
It's Wendy ❤️🐕
MSG gives me violet depression. It should be eliminated before a person takes drugs for ill moods.
Maybe there’s a problem that your back itches a lot.
Steve o is going to die a legend which will live forever such a genuine nice crazy guy lol
I rather smoke weed than take zoloft wtf Steeve O?
Johnny Knoxville next
I really love who Steveo has become..& might I say has gotten hotter with age.. maybe it’s the new smile..🤷🏻‍♂️😂
Just like my mom!!!!!!
What did he take Zollab? What is it
Wendy is a queen and Steave-O is amazing.
Wish this was a wild boyz era steve-o essential episode. That would've been wild to see what that Steve-O would've brought to this haha. Nitrous cartridges and bottle would've been 1 for sure
I love Steve-O and I'm so glad he's such in a good place. Watched him so much when I was a kid in high school in the early 2000s.
This guy is such an amazing feel good story. Just an absolute mess for decades and now hes a good dude. Hes just a solid good guy that seems vey open and honest. His sobriety is inspiring for real.
Steveo is truely one of the most interesting personalities. Love steve
Full steam ahead baby 🙏
Steve-O looks so clean he looks like he never did drugs 👍🏿
Lol. I have the same thermos haha
owmagaaaa! my back scratcher is a cheap stainless sandok. the Asian version. LOL!
Sober Steve-0 is awesome 👏
Can't live without... Erm I'd say crack 😂
Living without Healthcare or a pension which resulted in a bunch of old men hurting themselves in Jacka$$ is just sad. SteveO need a real JobO
Im severely allergic to zoloft
So happy you are happy, Steve-O
Proud of Steve-o he legit gives humanity for better
Didn’t expect to see my girl Wendy😍😍 love herrrr
Absolutely adore steveo it's great to see him thriving
Steve-o I got your hot sauce for Christmas and man now I put it on everything I eat love it man not to hot but full of flavor it’s basically the perfect hot sauce!!
Steve-O please check out Houston Jones!!!!👀 You guys could do a rad collab!!!!
Deff getting some Steve-O hot sauce! Never knew
That "back scratcher" looks more like a shower brush. That's probably why you said you can't find another one. Because you're looking up the wrong thing.
Yeah dude!
Wendy-O ♥️
Steve please come to fort Wayne, indiana on your tour!!!!!
What a stellar feller! All the other celebrities essential videos have chains, cars, super expensive stuff. Steve-Os is exactly that, essential! The waterpick was hilarious!
“Still got those million dollar teeth”
You should have Si Robertson on the show
Someone tell my boy to search for a back shower scrubber instead
I’d love to hear more about how he got his dog Wendy trained and certified as a service dog.
What a guy ❤️ God bless if you see this
This episode is brought to you by athletic greens,
This is Steve-O's brightest timeline. ♥
I’m just not ready for Steve-O to be looking like Adam Carolla
He forgot to mention cannabis.Dude is a total stoner and his voice is shot
These days, I find myself constantly taken aback by Steve-O acting like... Steve-O. He's sobered up, he's older, and he generally looks and dresses very nice. And then he busts out the #dickograph and I remember Oh yeah, that's Steve-O. 😭
A true success story! So proud of SteveO
If this was the 2000's one should have been coke.
So, he takes pills to stay sober huh?
He’s sure done a lot. Great 2 c him enjoying a happy sober life. Way the go!!
People who don't know steve o watching this video are like...o a normal looking guy  People who know Steve o......pickachu shock face with how far he came I honestly thought he would die...there is a certain amount of drugs you can do before you are destroyed
he really caught me off guard when he took out his tooth 🥴
Steve-o is so wholesome
1. His false teeth
STEVEO IS THE BEST !
I’ve got to be honest I started using a water flosser when I was 17 and had braces. Since the removal of my braces I continue on using it and my teeth have never been better
Decided to give it a $$$
Watching and listening to a dysfunctional degenerate functioning among us is the biggest oxymoron I’ve seen.
I’m so glad this man survived everything he went through and is still here
You guys need to put Mayweather here
Great dude 🐾 Love the dog!!
He's proof you really can change
Looking forward to seeing the new Jackass
The first time I used a waterpik, it felt powerful enough to take paint off a car.
he's a national treasure
Waterpik? That means waterdick in danish.
Zoloft is Good one !
We are all attention whores
Wendy is one Rock Solid Doggo.  What a temperament.
Such a lovely bloke so humble
Wendy! 😍
Just like me fr 😀 2:17 but the difference is she's not my girl and Risk getting reported all the time
Steve-o is a national treasure
Steve-O was down bad when he was young and Bam was living life and doing great, 20 years later complete opposite
🤣🤣
Wow
Steve-O is one of the few guys who is impossible to hate.
That dog is incredibly behaved!
So happy to see him doing well.   Side note: Wendy is the calmest Belgian malinute I’ve ever seen. They’re usually bouncing off the walls.
to be honest stevo deserves all the success that has and will ever come to him
Wendy ❤️
🇵🇪💯
Steve-O is freaking awesome! I could listen to his stories all day.
i wonder if he can have kids after all the drugs & stunts he’s done?
such an inspiration for our generation. there’s nothing this man can’t do
Take care of yourself
Im glad somebody like Steve-O is using his platform to voice that he's taking prozac for mental health issues like anxiety. On our way to decrease to the stigma related to mental illness!!
Best one yet
Man stevo is getting old
I had a drug problem and ive always been a jackass fan . When this guy got sober i did the same thing . I toughtif he can do it than  so can i .... so tankyou steve o . I havent touch any drugs in a long time and im proud to say steve o inspired me to do so thank you dude hope you live forever 🤙🏽
Wendy made me cry 😢   May you both live forever! The world loves you
i love steve
God I love Steve-O
https://youtu.be/y49ggLveMpM
Steve-O is next level
this video was amazing, steveo is such a cool guy but really i clicked here because of wendy i love her
I am I a man with a robot voice
If you dislike Steve-O There's something REALLY messed up with you .
The dog being #1 says a ton about where his mental state is. Much love Steve-O!
Wendy da real MVP
I didn't know Steve O was on Zoloft. Now I feel like I should be on it or something of I want to quit be addicted to drinking and cocaine
For those who don’t know, steveo actually started seeing a speech therapist and he sounds so much better in this interview. Can’t help but feel proud of the man, he never stops trying to better himself 💕
Imagine how different his essentials would have been if it was still 2002 😂
I absolutely love him. Probably the best guest you've had on this. He's completely open, completely genuine - and yes, an absolute gentleman. Thanks for being a part of my childhood and someone I can look up to today.
Some Peruvian guy is going "Hey where's my dog?" XD
There’s no one like Steve-O
Que paso con tu pagina de YouTube steve-o en castellano  Steve se te estraña y mas yo que fuistes un amor desde la primera ves que te vi e tus videos jackass
I hope you guys do a Johnny Knoxville one too.
I did coke with him in Cancun
He looks so old 😲😭  I can barely recognize him. Especially with all the hair 😄😄😄
Yup marker my bro gave me a steve o mugshot poster with your signature 👌🏼 the best
Do u think Wendy knows both Spanish and English?
This is essentially an ad…….wtf
If only Alec Baldwin had one of those coffee thermoses he probably would understand triggers better.
#JACKASSFOREVER
That was so good. Way better seeing actually real things people use and not just selling us a bunch a crap 🤘
Stevo brand back scratchers?
Steve- O Himself is essential to pop culture and 90s babies.
Loved this episode. Wonderful seeing Steve-O, he looks great!!!
I'm so glad He isn't on here shilling a 1000$ speaker or watch.
not good to swallow plaq
Anyone elses back feel itchy when he scratched his?
In danish, the waterpik means waterpenis, pretty funny lol
Steve o is a true inspiration as someone who Is sober this guy gave me hope that hope that if he could do it, anyone can
Oh no not the zoloft....😧☹️ I wish steve o wont do Anything for himself ..because ive buried many friends who wqs on zoloft or prozac Ssri snri Antidepressants drugs with black box warning. Its all bad...☹️ Wish you well Steve o! 👍🍀
I saw this man at the comedy store in San Antonio sat right in front of the stage. Got a pic and a signed shirt form him. Such an inspiration
Legend.
genuienly one of the greatest humans on this planet
yoww jackas...
"It just doesn't compare to you..."-Stevo singing to his back scratcher.
Backscratcher?  Lol.  Pretty sure that's a shower brush
Steve O Can't Wait For JACKASS FOREVER
I really enjoyed this. Thanks for looking for attention, I am ready to pay.
Happy Thursday Steve -O
Wendy is so cute. I'm happy you rescued her.
Florida man
Wendy is essential
He doesn’t always swallow his waterpik water though does he?
The more I hear Steve-o talk the more I like him. He seems like such a genuine nice guy and humble.
He's crazy u Kno that right?..😅😅
Athletics greens *happy Joe Rogan noises*
The legend
You can tell he's been working on his voice! They way he talked normally damages his throat
Steve-O hijo de toda su reputísima madre como lo amo al desgraciado
Stevo-o deserves it all! Lux is a lucky girl, congrats on GQ spot, this is amazing!
Glad he’s in good spirits
What GQ didn't realize is that steve-o snuck 2 advertisement's 😂 the man is a pusher of product's God bless him 🙏
Can’t live without God ❤️❤️🙏🏾🙌🏾
He's Gonzo
Steveo’s butt hole destroyer hot sauce is the best name I’ve ever heard
This was everything I needed
Did this mofo drink his waterpik floss water?? Classic Steve O 😂😂😂
Bless you Steve o
We all love Wendy!!
i can see steve-o as an big mouth character
His hot sauce is incredible
STEVE O!
OMG, what a sweet fur baby!! Wendy is such a good dog, I can't believe you found her in the streets and she's that docile and was able to become a service dog! I don't know how I'd react if my husband sent me a d*ck pic everytime he went somewhere w his toiletries, but to each their own and I'm surprised you've only lost 1 tooth in your career!! I'm glad to see he's sober and thriving!! I'm a struggling addict myself! It's motivating to see that!!
Such a legend and a good dude
😂😂😂😂
Mate your dogs so well behaved I have the same breed his  nothing but  energy
Wait a minute...so steve-O can take Zoloft but Bam cant take aderol?
LEGEND!!
Steve has evolved into Adam Carolla
I knew #1 would be wendy❤
That’s a back scrubber lmao but I’m sure it gets the itches real nice
if this was made when he was in his prime , he would of just drop drugs on the table😂
So after all that, he isn't actually clean! Unfuckingbelieveable!!
he's fake well it seems
#1 fame
What is that clothes hanging thing called he brought out of bag lol?…I need one
No Monster Munch?
one of the greats
If someone told me back in 2001 when I was watching Jackass on MTV that Steve O would become one of the most wholesome celebrities out there,  I´d call them well crazy.
0:02: ..."Why do I sound kinda like Whoopi Goldberg?..."
This is beautiful, glad to see you doing all this great things god bless g!
STEVOOOOO SUCH A LEGENDARY ICON
What a sad human being. Good luck to him
Johnny Knoxville is a Legend.  Steve-O is Immortal.
I recommend watching the video where he meets Wendy. Its beautiful.
How many items did this man pull out, defs more than 10! I wish my pullout was this strong
So happy to see this guy surviving and honestly thriving, such an inspiration dude, keep on doin your thing
I ❤️ Wendy (and the video of Steve rescuing her).
love steve
I want a Wendy..
It’s odd how validating it is to hear Steve-o say how much Zoloft helps him
That dog looks awsome.
STEVE-O YEAH DUDE! 🤘
This comment section is just full of love and I love it.
One bam will be here
He swallows his water pick water
Love u G!
Yep, still a Galactic tool.
Steve is becoming Adam Corolla as he gets older, except he’s funnier, cooler, and better in every way.
These are terrible items
So proud of Steve! He looks amazing! And I just love beautiful Wendy ❤️
Some Peruvian military dog trainer got dishonorably discharged.
I love Wendy’s UFC collar
I have Zoloft
wendy awwwwwwww
Love the podcast bro!! Everyone watch Wildride with Steve-O!! Wendy is such an awesome dog💯💯 you're an inspiration brother
You can only respect
There's a level of sweet chaos to Steve-O. I'm really glad to see he's in a good place. He seems like such a genuine guy.
U rock homes
Omg a Mali! Did not realize that in the video of you finding her !! So smart so beautiful, my favourite breed and future breed this year in a few months
lets mia khalifa go undercover on the internet
“And there not paying me to say that “ 😂 Steve 0 is a classic gotta love him
With most people, this kind of change would be seen as disappointing, but with Steve-O it just makes everyone happy to see him so healthy and happy.
Why don't they post the items and where they can be found
Man everybody getting old😥
MY HEROOO
If you do Johnny Knoxville, he’s definitely bringing that Catheter.
really disappointed that he didn’t pull out the cheetah thong
Steve-o is right about the Waterpik, way better than flossing
This is just an ad for his hot sauce and that'd bs supplement ag1
Yo
Wow camera stores are my happy place too. Highkey therapy, j just go there to hang around.
As a dental hygienist I love that he travels with a water pik!!@
Bro I'm so proud of your sobriety! I fight those demons on a daily. I love every thing you do!!! Much love!!!
I have the same exact thermos
I trust his AG1 recommendation than everyone on YouTube getting sponsored by them
Yeaaaa Steve-O !!!
I want to buy Steve’s back scratcher when he passes 😭
Bam not on the list?
Peak design!!
Omg best one by far!! 🤣
I like how steveos essentials are so much more practical then most others that have been presented.
It makes me so genuinely happy seein this dude still grinding and bein happy after all these years. I feel like a lot of the jackass guys kinda stagnated after 3, but this dude started up a whole new career with standup and youtube
Surely he can't live without the late great Ryan Dunn, RIP man youre always missed
Yeaaaaaaaaah dude!
It showed Wendy and I almost hugged my phone.
so he is taking something
Proof addiction is a disease. Proof people can get better. Physical evidence.
I grew up with Steve-O and I almost teared up. Glad he's thriving
Wtf is wrong with his voice…
Zoloft is a life saver. Little to no side effects and is a great boost to your mental health. By no means can you feel it like a drug but it doesn’t allow you to go to the depths that depression allows.
How adorable is Wendy tho, seriously??
Wendy is the goat!! Forget steve
Imagine if Steve O made this video 10 years ago for the Jackass movie. Would have been a completely different video
STEVE O IS AN AMERICAN ICON AND HERO.
Very well spoken Steve
Most of these essentials videos are stupid. This one was actually meaningful.
Best ad athletic greens could ask for
Awesome guy right there good to see Steve O back in action
I have been waiting for this video to happen for so long
NIIICE!!!!! Love his mobile media carry on!!!! So sweeeet man!
GOOD JOB GQ!! LOVE STEVE-O!!!!!!!!
💜💛💜💛
not a back scratcher
his tooth bro😂
Steve-o is just a legend man
He looks like a young Adam Carolla
that dog is such a gentleman
6:26 I thought that was something else..👀
best one comes last
Sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo...... This whole video is a plug?
his smile is one of the best things on this planet
Steve'O's life is like a movie that everybody would say is unrealistic
This video brought to you by Zoloft
Street dogs are actually pretty smart and some can be friendly towards humans.
Sweet an 8 min ad 🖕
I’m happy to know Steve-O takes Zoloft. It all makes sense. He was self medicating for so long when he was using so when he finally got clean, him and his therapist were able to find the root cause of his mental health issues.  For myself, PAXIL for life!!!!!
after all these years of tom foolery, im so glad to see Steve O is such an avid self care man
I love this fella!
Man this dude did come a long way.
YEA DUDE
It's good he said it because I would.
Wendy is definitely the top essential, can de-stress you instantly. Everyone needs a Wendy.
Any Wendy Day is a good Day
idol
I'm waiting for him to say whip-its haha
I eat those peppers. So Im definitely buying some. One to eat, one for buttchug
That back scratcher bristles actually used to be white
Problems with substances? hook up with SteveO
I need that hot sauce!!
He loves his dog more than his girlfriend hahaa!
I don’t see the duct tape
wow he's looking old
*Steve-o* didn’t include Raycon earbuds. He owes us earbuds now.
love him
Good stuff Steve-O 🤙🏻
That’s a cool thermos
LETS GOO STEVE O
If living things count, what about Lux?
1 more day can’t wait!!!!
Manscape !
If dialysis isn't one of them, it will be
The O
Bam, if Steve-O can do it so can you
I love Wendy’s UFC dog collar
Being a steve-o fan you know exactly every single of these items he listed
Steve -o is a legend
I like sober steve.
It's crazy the how different the essentials are between the young goofy "celebrities" and the people who've been around like Steve-O
Who else thought Steve O would be dead by now? Lol   In all seriousness,  im glad to see him healthy
🐐 👑
what the dog doin
Steve-O is the comeback of the century
What a legend
Peru loves you Steve-O🙏🏻🙏🏻🇵🇪🇵🇪 I'm sure Wendy has a blast traveling the world with you💯💯
Steve-O really is an inspiration. Everything he’s got in life he earned himself. Also being sober for years is amazing. Especially when you see how bad he was. Well done Steve ❤️
Shameless plugs. Will you never stop?  Lol. Love ya Steve-O!
One of the best episodes
Steve-O, man, myth, legend, master of chaotic energy… also, apparently the  most organized man I’ve ever seen 🤣. Love it!
It's so relieving to see Steve-O so happy. The fact that he's so down to Earth and has no issue joking with the interviewers shows that even after everything he's been through, he's still a lighthearted, goofy personality.
Your an entertainer and a very interesting man Mr. Attention who're lol
steve-o is such an inspiration
Yeah dude
does anyone know what cameras he has?
This dude is still relevant? Lol
This is the best one by far. I really love Steve-O. Y’all should check out his YouTube Channels.
I love Steve-o being honest and open about his mental health and his meds, when you know that everyone else that's ever done one of these is definitely on the same stuff. Just refreshing to have someone take a little more stigma off taking care of oneself 😊😊
Love this man
You know how drug and alcoholic people are all annoying when they're high. Steve o actually is just annoying every minute of the day high or sober.
Steve ooooooo best guy
The 🐐
So happy to see he's come such a long way into the icon he's now today 😊
Cant wait I'm gonna try to watch your show in my city mr o
Wendy!
Someone explain why my gums could feel the water pic tickling em.
I saw a vid of steve o in morroco or maybe turkey. And he played with a stray dog. And let it stay in his hotel for the whole of his trip. So much respect and juju for this guy man.
I usually don't care about "celebrities" but I love Steve O and the crew so much they've brought so much genuine joy and laughter to the world its so good to see all of them still going so strong I just hope Bam can get his stuff together once and for all
Love u SteveO!
steve o !
This man made my childhood and still is making me laugh at every video deserves everything
I appreciate how his essentials are ACTUALLY essentials and not him trying to flex like others that come on the show.
I love steve-o especially his graspy voice idk why lol 😅😂💙
Super Stoked for Jackass Forever 😎
Wow.  That bit about Zoloft was suuuuuuper off-putting, huh?  😕 That was like a combination of a commercial and a description of dangerous side effects.
Please do young thug
“10 things Johnny Knoxville can’t live without” next please!!
I feel like this is one of the few "things I can't live without" where you can tell he actually uses all the stuff he talks about...
The best character on this format, ever.
I know they say it’s a terrible thing to waste your time looking on the internet for, but I had to this time for my man Steve O
Man Must’ve worked Rly hard to get where he is today, so hard that only he knows how much courage, will, enthusiasm and passion it took to get that drive……..hoping y’all r productive and happy this year too :)
good video
Steve-Oʼs voice sounds so legendary, his voice is almost deeper than the ocean.
I think he's a complete degenerate, but when he admitted to Zoloft being essential, you really have to admire his honesty. It's hard not to respect anyone being that open about mental health issues, especially when he encourages people taking things that have a stigma attached to them.
Is the hot sauce good? Anybody try it
exact reasons why we love this guy....
One of the coolest humans to ever live on this planet
I can hear his stories all day lol He’s a legend 💪🏽
Ill scratch that back for you dog. Please no other stunts though.
Weirdly respectable personality
Steve-O kicks asses ! Wendy is so cute and in love with Steve ! :) Way to Go Man !
This man is my whole childhood 😎
Steveo is the perfect example of celebrity turning his life around and being a complete hero at the end of it. I never used to like him in the early Jackass days. Wasn't a fan of his character at all. Then he sobered up and I ran across him again and he is genuinely the nicest, sweetest, most happy, friendly guy of the crew. Always so happy to see him in these new uploads.  To think Bam was my favourite over him before.. now it's completely flipped
finally a 🐐
Steve O is a National Treasure and must be protected at all cost
I love that he was so honest about his struggles and that he takes medication, it empowers so many people to take care of their mental health ♥️
The man, the myth, the legend, the walking bodybag, etc
What a likeable guy.
Where’s the N20?? 🤣🤣
Steve-O is a personal hero. When i was young and destructive, he was too. But in a way that was non-harmful to those around him. As someone who went through alcohol and party issues myself, he was an example of strength and perseverance to me. As someone who loves nothing more than to travel and experience life in ones own way, seeing him now live that dream in a clean way, with a dog companion is awesome. Seeing Steve-O now makes me happy and proud as a fan and co-struggler in the crazy game of life. As i am for anyone who overcomes addiction and mental strife.
Shoutout to Steve-Os tour bus almost running me over in Milwaukee a couple weeks ago. Driver did not give two fucks and ran a red light downtown
So glad to see Steve-O looking so healthy and happy. Dude's a legend.
The only one and legend Steve-O, Yeah dude!
so humble and cool - no overpriced RMs and gold chains
Being hooked on zoloft isn’t clean.

This was a really enjoyable episode.
These are the most realistic items compared to what other celebrities have shown.
i just love steve-o
I just watched that video of him finding his dog Wendy and almost melted brooooo
If there was ever a man who deserves everything he's ever achieved its this man
Steve o saying “my girl” sounds pretty cringe 😂😂
Steve-O came prepared!! and I respect that a lot. Some people will come in with like, airpods, a chapstick, a phone, a lighter and a key. Lazy and boring.
Yeeee
Wow
didn't expect his vulnerability, honestly beautiful
here before it blows up
Among my random stories, I once sat at a Hooters with Steve O.( the Manhattan one,dunno if it’s still there)
That is the calmest Malinois I’ve ever seen. Mine would be losing her mind without something to do for that long
You just can’t help but love this guy man
Why did I not know something like a waterpick exists? I need to order one asap
“Xanax mix” 😭😭😭🐕
This is crazy for the last two days i've been on Steve O videos marathon and now this
Early
The mfkn *G.O.A.T Of MadLads Worldwide* 🌍 🐐 👑 🌍

Steve-O came a long way in his sobriety. He’s living his best life and props to him
Literally just cried… I love Wendy! Lost my German Shepard “Rocky” 3 years back.. hasn’t been the same.
Shout out to my Zoloft crew
Lol my dad has that “back-scratcher” it’s not a back scratcher though it’s for the shower
Steve O will forever be that guy 💯😂 MTV DAYS

“2022 WILL BE MY OUT BREAK YEAR IN MY MUSIC CAREER”…🙏🏽
Steve-Os been through so much I'm so glad he's clean. God bless Steve-O.
My wife just asked me is that Whoopi-Goldberg talking 🤣🤣🤣
The only douche u cant hate he a legend.
The zoloft sponsorship.
You know you made it when sharpies are essential whenever your traveling on tour especially when your bringing 4k cameras
Good video!
11th thing: going crazy
Steevo's wild ride is so dope man.  So glad he got clean.
