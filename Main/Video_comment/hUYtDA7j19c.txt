Congrats to Smokin' Ed Currie for breaking a new Guinness World Record for hottest chili pepper! Like if you need more content with Ed and Chili Klaus.
When he said it's a lot of fun when he watches people in the fight or flight mode I just thought man you sadistic mother trucker
THE CHAMP IS HERE
What's it like when it comes out the other end? Emergency room? You probably can't sit normally for about 10 days.....
bring my boy chili back sean more klaus content
"I love seeing you but also I don`t like it" 🤣🤣🤣
Smoked em edd
That looks fun.
Klaus: Did you invent that pepper? Sean: Yes Klaus: Why? It's kinda funny :)👌
I'm 2 years late but I enjoyed the whole thing :)
Sean eat a steam not even the pepper disappointed 😢
Why aren’t people talking about how Ed never feels anything…..
Think the next sauce should be called i m in heat
“White people don’t know flavor” “White people don’t season their food”  White people just for fun:
Noah has such a friendly and reassuring smile!
I am very curious what happens next day when u go to the toilet 😂😂
the orange hat guy is a psyo
9:35 When Ed said it’s more like 3x hotter than a reaper you could see Klaus go from concerned to SCARED…you can see the regret in his face 😂
Ed like: Come at me bro.
HELP I HAVE NEVER SEEN SEAN SUFFERING THIS MUCH IM CRYING
Sean Breaking Bad: Tight, tight, tight!
When your first reaction is creating a stabbing motion with your hand...yeah we get it hahaha
The best funny reaction ever "i'm in Heat" 🤣🤣🤣
I honestly don't like stuff much hotter than a habanero pepper. After that the flavor goes down as the heat goes up. And i mean the pepper, not the flavors in sauces. But still a pepper or two above that and now i cant taste whatever you put it on, i just taste the heat. But i still love blowing my tongue up once and a while with insane heat
I made a very spicy jerky, can I send you a sample?
"I think theres some oak in it.... and pencil"😂😂
It even looks poisonous
Love it -- Did you invent this pepper?   Yeah!    Why?!
Ich mag auch scharf, aber ich glaub davon würde ich sterben. ☠️
I would love to grow one little pepper x plant but im sure it would even be dangerous just to have it around
Skip to 10:37
I love passionate people man and you can see how proud dude is, love to see it.
That was beautiful when he got his certificate ❤
Ed is , undoubtedly , the David Blaine of peppers . Impressive. Love this guy for all he is 💯
"it has no real throat burn... But that comes on later when you're in pain 😈😈😈"
Pain is excruciating,
What's the friggin point of this?
😂😆Respect🤙
Я один понимаю, что от этого можно умереть? 😮
Everyone else: Dying  Ed: casually says “im feeling exactly like you’re feeling” without any expression.   That man is not human. 😂
Ed is clearly a time traveling Terminator...
Dont you guys get excruciating stomache aches?
Did you invent that...yes...why...😂😂😂😂
Ed tanking it, this guy is badass
Soooo if you get a pepper x pod can't you just extract the seeds to grow your own?
He's in heat !!! hahahlolol
I just ate a whole reaper today. Shared 6 of them with friends who all ate little specks of the pepper lol. I handled it better than I thought I would. Went back and got scorpion peppers for tomorrow
That comes out later ... when your in.....pain!! 😆
😂😂
“I’m in heat” Chili Klaus. 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Did you invent this? - why?! 😂😂😂
First thing he looks for is caps with minors... were gunna need Chris Hansen
If Chili Klaus dies, we riot! 😂
you had the smallest piece ever you fraud
You would never see me touch these things. It would be sure fire see the light!!!
That was great! Shake it off. Ha!
a
why would you willingly consume a chemical weapon.
انتي متعه الضحك والمسخره😂😂😂😂😂😂
Chili Klaus hot in da house <3
for anybody wondering - ed doesnt speak until he fully chews the pepper, that way he gets a full mouth of saliva to dumb out some of the heat.
Ed calmly  experiencing the heat  wgile others suffer he admits others are suffering like him
I ate 3 banana peppers once.
Make the best tasting pepper.
Is Ed a wizard?
That inventor dude looks like he would be able to spell Pepper X let along invent it... but actually he is very well spoken, super informed, and impressive with weaving in casual promos for their pepper.  Well done sir!
Congrats Ed and the team. If it ever gets beat I'm sure it will be you who does it...
You know it's for real when Sean will not eat it.
Congratulations,  bro! You're a hero!! :D we LLLLLLOVE YOUR WORK, SIR! :D
Dude Ed a savage.
Dude Ed ate it like I would eat a banana pepper and act like im the master of spice
Ed Currie is a very unwell man
A comment for engagement
Man Edd is awesome! <3 Congrates my guy.
"Whats the culinary experience you try to create" he asked very calm. All i heard from Ed was a fancy way of saying "i want to hurt people and make them miserable so they learn to appreciate taste more"
5:23 SUGAR WATER ED. SUGAR WATER. BIG DIFFERENCE. Now we know why your sauces had a vastly different scoville level when another channel tested it.
I hope Ed does really well with Pepper X so he can fix those dreadful teeth.
Ed eats way too much pepper
👏🏼🔥
“Oh no klaus is breeding” 😂
Beacuse it's logarythimc scale it means that 2.000.000SHU is less than 2 times more than 1.000.000SHU. It's logarythmic, but not with tendency to go up, its just more flat on a graph.
I have no idea why anyone subjects themselves to this type of elemental pain. Just insane! I eat anything a little spicy my buds don’t like it, and my backdoor pays the price for a couple of days!!
Now there's a guy that loves his craft! .. Congrats Ed!
The way ed describes what everyones feeling (while admitting that he is feelin it too) reminds me of when I'd introduce friends to salvia in my early 20s. I'd done it enough to get high on it but still know what was going on around me.
It comes on later when your in pain😂😂😂
"Im in heat" 😂
Can this be damaging to you body inside?
I love the snaps!!!
Chili Klaus is goated! xD
I wanna see Ed with veneers
Congratulations my friend! I love that feeling for you!!
Ed is a maniac hahahaha
Just like his Scandinavian cousins? 😅
This was great! 🤣
Lol. I'm in heat!
I have made peace with myself, and decided that I'm okay with going to my grave having never tried Pepper X! I thank you Sean, not only for the great interviews, but for demonstrating why I will have no regrets for my decision!  🙃
Ed: “I would be feeling what these guys are feeling if I hadn’t long ago obliterated my palate, leaving only a smoking hole.”
Their comments had me laughing repeatedly. “Did you make this pepper? Vy did you do zat?”
I didn’t expect to laugh like that …..
The gods have assembled
"Im in heat" 😂😂😂
Masochists.
One of these days we will collectively discover the fatal result of eating Satan's saliva as the intestines of the people who ate Pepper X start to dissolve within their abdomens. The burn in the mouth is just the beginning of the internal destruction!
This is hilarious.
The thing this reminds me the most of?  Slap fighting.
High Pressure Liquid Chromatography mentioned!!
Better than the moonlanding that never was😂
Can't wait for the day I can get some of these
I love how people often just start talking crazy.. with words just coming out no filter.. Ya, obviously the foundation of Hot Ones.
I love watching Klaus eat hot peppers.. just for the very entertaining responses and ways he deal with it.. the hickups and snapping makes me giggle.
That would send 99.900000.1 % of people straight to the ER
episode is kinda mute when we now know the acual heat of the x sauce ,, if you dont know its milder than the bomb , witch is acually the highest ,, sevral celebs have more or less comfirmed the same ,, the pepper x itself is prob the hottest but not the sauce they made
12:00 the way he says, "there's an intense burn!"  Perfect delivery!
Ed didn’t even flinch lol
I swear that chilli klaus is funny af 😂sometimes even without knowing it absolutely hilarious 😂😂😂😂
Oak & Pencil 😂🤣😂
Is there an antidote for spicy food that takes the heat away immediately 😂😝🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
Would be fun if they started an episode eating the thing in the opening. Just eat it straight off the bat. Then go through the show completely wrecked. Just a suggestion.
I've seen the last bit of this video about 20 times now and I can't stop laughing at Klaus "I'm in heat" it replays in my head and gives me a good giggle frequently
Klaus running off camera at the end. You could tell he was hurting bad
such tastings can be dangerous
Holy jeez, I felt their pain and I didn’t even eat one.  Ed just shook that off.  His heat tolerance is probably unrivaled at this point.
Bogus
Chili Klaus is great 😂
To be fair he didn’t take it out of the “war chest”, it’s not available to the public, thus can’t be tested apart from the one sample he gave them, which could be hand picked. Which definitely is hand picked I mean. So we have no idea if it’s truly legit. Do your research, there’s a lot of controversy around this pepper. Anyway I am not saying it’s NOT the hottest, it’s just kinda convoluted so it’s hard to tell for sure.
WHY?
"Did you invent that pepper?" "Yeah" "Why?" I was wheezing at that part for some reason.
Reviews for the sauce say it isn't that hot. Did they dilute it or something
liked that f@@%ed up faces at the end 😂😂😅  testing part was so fun
No johnny scoville?
You completely broke Klaus!
stop touching peppers with your bare hands. your eyes or nether regions have no reason to meet these oils
Klaus OG for having the whole chilli
Ed’s passion for chilli’s is so wholesome
Ed currie a true villain
Should have made the Guinness guy eat one
Congratulations Ed!
I just came across a Smokin Ed's chicken korma and I could not resist. I did not read the box apart from "WARNING 18+ only" It was only when I had cooked it for dinner and began to eat that I had to go and get the box to read about it and then check out the "Pepper X challenge" and discovered then that I was eating a curry with the hottest chilli pepper in the entire world! And then it made sense as to why exactly my mouth was in utter pain. I did eat quite a fir bit of it before telling myself Ill just put it back in the fridge for another day. Congratulations Ed for making it to the record book you and your crew deserve it for all the years of hard work YEEHAW!
I'm in pain just watching Chili Klaus suffer.
haha Klaus
The Hot Ones Pringles ad ran in the middle of this, and i think they missed an opportunity to do a Hot Ones Pringles Curated Experience. Shorter can, and from the top to the bottom every 3 or 4 chips would get progressively hotter and hotter just like the show
How in the world , can Ed Currie be so  calm  ?
I feel the exact same way when people eat my edibles
Need to know about the orange cap guy...
it was so spicy he turned into an owl for a second 11:09
I'd eat a whole pepper x
"That comes on later when you're in pain" good lord 😂😂😂😂
Totally fun to watch.. Personally though, would NOT be fun to eat. I appreciate the craft though 😂
I feel like Sean is faking every time I swear he doesn't feel the heat
I xan hear Danish but I'm South African, weird but interstimg
Chili Klaus is the star everytime 😂😂
Hes going to take the warthog pepper and breed it with something else I guarantee it.
I really want to try this sauce. I am not big on going too far outside of comfort when it comes to heat... but there is a Ghost pepper based sauce I can't stop going back to because they nailed a flavor heat blend I really enjoy... Id eat more of it but its a couple days of pain, the second phase being the most uncomfortable that occurs on the exit.
did you invent that pepper ? yeah ! WHYYYYYY ???? xD
When he says that the peppers come up is more cerebral, it makes me think of a wasabi or horseradish type of hot, I wonder if that’s how it could feel somewhat
The owner eats it no reaction
the duo once again
Did you invent that? yes!, why?!
Yall dealing with a MAD Scientist
Schadenfreude can bite back Ed.
Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster ahh treat
Why?
Klaus is in heat because he was thinking about his hot scandanavian cousins
the eating seems fake
There's a man that loves what he does, congratulations ed
Holy SMOKES! You people are FRIGHTFUL!!!
Bro ed not gonna hurt him, the pepper X did…..
Pepper x is not the hottest. Sad how marketing and money makes things happen
It looks like something that was tortured for 20 years. This must demolish you 😅😅
11:00 Sean found the replacement for Botox.
I equate the Scoville Scale with the Richter scale, but with a bunch of zeros added onto the end
I thought I was cool after eating a ghost pepper and a scorpion pepper. I will take your word for it on this one.
Poor chili.... Such a great friend to suffer for views for this channel.
I do not like the flavor of the reaper tbh. I’d say I want to try pepper x but the cap cramps from the reaper were pretty brutal.
Holy cow! I am just watching this and my eyebrows just singed up.
That Ed Currie guy is a f-cking strange individual
I didn't know that hot peppers ruin your teeth. This guy probably makes enough money to make his teeth as white as Jo Koy.
How does their nose not run?
Oak and pencil overtones
Lol at the end, did you invent that pepper? Yeah, why??
I kinda hate the hype around Pepper X. and theres no seeds available. Right now theres not even Carolina Reaper Seeds on puckerbutts website.
A normal pepper maker couldn't have made a video like this. It takes a huge personality like Ed to step in and serenely narrate the absolute devastation in the room while his cohosts are at a loss for words and the utter mercy of the pepper gods just like him. Absolute legend.
buddy needs a dentist
IM IN HEAT 😂
AWESOME
there is more emotion in that "why" than I've ever heard in any human speech to this date
Chili Klaus: "I think I'm dying" Ed: "Nice flavor"
I'm guessing Ed Currie has the highest heat tolerance in the world?  Pretty amazing to watch!
Why did Sean eat so little ??
11:37 “What do you think of the flavor?” Klaus answer and physical reaction are great!
Ed being a Swiftie 😆😆
🎊👏 congratulations !
How are they so confident??? Pepper x seeds are for sale online😂
4:02, me processing how much pain sean evans experiences
Lowkey gonna drop $120 to get a lineup with some Xperience
Is Klaus ok now?
I seen people choking eating taco Bell hot sauce 😂 Imagine this
This NEVER gets old!! 😂😂😂😂 I love it!!
Pain is so much the expert had to describe it 11:55
What a legend
If you think the episode where the peppers go in is entertaining, just wait for the episode on the way out!
“I like when people get scared eating my hot sauce”  THIS MAN MIGHT BE A PSYCHOPATH  Edit: he’s tearing up trying to thank his team, this man is a gem and a lunatic and I love it
Chit yourself hot!
Makes me happy they still bring Chili Klaus back every once and a while 😊
My man in the jean jacket is literally dying on set and they are laughing! Classic!
I'm in heat xD XD XD
MAN YAL SHOULD OF BROUGHT OUT GORDAN RAMSEY FOR EATING PEPPER X....😂😢😅
Chili KLAUS = Legend 🥇
It’s the devil incarnate as is its creator.
Looks like an infected boil. Tastes like the sun. Congratulations! You did it! 😆
So fun watching four grown men in pain.  Aren't we all sadistic?
Two cool video ideas. Shaq, the man who doesn’t make a face in response to spicy foods, eats one of these evil fruits. The other, Mr. Evans and Mr. Klaus eat the coldest foods possible. Sean, if I may be so bold as to refer to him by his first name, has said more than once that when him and Mr. Klaus, it’s always like what we just witnessed. Flip the script. Let us see what that is like. 😊
"I think there's some oak in it... and pencil" Sean: "yeah, definitely pencil"  gets me everytime, i'm dead
Chilli Klaus looks like he's going to quit. How is the inventor able to keep his face so static
loved this!
The middle guy Ed is so wealthy money wise and he wont go to the dentist 😢
pepper X is scam
I wonder when the one chip challenges come out for this im glad to see ed's business flourish and his acknowledgement of his workers that made it possible
So lame Sean didn’t eat a whole one
Ed Currie’s ability to consume literal molten lava and not look phased in the slightest is a true superpower.
ed had 10 years to build a tollorance to this pepper so no wonder he took it like a champ
My man Chili Klaus the GOAT never fails to make me laugh until I cry, love him!
But Ed. You’re not actually telling us the culinary purpose lol. Anyone else notice that? He just keeps talking about the heat.
Please have Josh and Ollie from Jolly on the show!!
it's crazy how the hotter a pepper is, the more evil it looks haha
11:33 Eds aura just increased X10 from that laugh
2:50 What if you ate that?
7:20 Congratulations but I’ve never in my entire life heard someone be a pepper skeptic LOL
Does Sean even like spicy food? Poor guy
God bless this crew.  2 Great
Congratulations Ed and all involved... 2025
I gapsed and then cringed as soon as I saw Klaus and Ed put the whole pepper in the mouth. You can feel the heat and burn just from watching their reaction.
Poor chili klause
Where can I buy some pepper x seeds
Hiring assassins to steal peppers lol
i don't believe ed actually ate that.  he bit the stem off and then spit it out.
The very very very final question is :      Why someone eat this?😂😂
Pure Insanity 😢😵‍💫🔥
So I wonder when Pepper X will make it into the Hot Ones line up?
Congrats to those brave warriors 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
When he said it took a team and it made me and him almost cry he is a real one Andy and his team deserves this respect 💪🏼🤙🏼
Chili Klaus reactions never fail to make me laugh
Dudes 1 liners are 🔥
11:10 🦉🦉🦉
Ed has so much hot pepper in his system that mosquitos explode when they try to bite him.
Why?
Some oak and pencil. Thats a serious cute dude. I guess, he is a very likeable dad.
Fantastic
They didn’t show the part where they all puke it up and writhe in agony over a toilet for 4 hours
This would be like taking acid with Jerry Garcia, he’s cool as a cucumber, I’m talking to a cat on the moon 😂
A laughed so much when he said "what is the culinary epxerience you're looking for"  As if this thing is anything but pure pain.
Ed is a psychopath.
No one’s trying to steal pepper secrets like that.
Guinness world records is an absolute joke.
Ed Currie will eventually come up with a pepper that will be lethal, then what?
I'm afraid I can't do much beyond a Habanero.  And even then.
And the inventor was just fine, like he ate a paprika
I can only imagine dumb thieves trying to steal from Ed’s war chest like “what are we even stealing?” “I don’t know some kind of fruit, it must be good if it’s worth stealing let’s try one” *cheers* *SATANS MOUTH GONERREAH INTENSIFIES*
...IM.. IN ... HEAT
Why?
Did Plancton try to steal the PepperX?
The sauce that you get is really not that bad. there are much hotter sauces out there. "da bomb" hot sauce is spicier than the last dab by far
If you taste oak and pencil after eating a chili pepper, the pepper may have broken you. 🤣
"I'm in heat"-Chili Klaus
Why am I watching 4 people legally get high? 🤣
I will try one eventually. While i was in rehab i would eat reapers straight out of the garden to get new people to try them because yeah they are hot but the only reaction i really get from them is hiccups it was fun watching guys freak out trying one for the first time.
This tells me I dont need to buy any 😂
Get Bill Murray for this one if you can make him acknowledge it you got a winner
I would love to try a Pepper X
❤ alright Ed. Well done boys. 👍😊🌏🐬
he's like a culinary firefighter. normies freak out in a fire, he feels the heat but is cool/calm
Oak and Pencil??? LOL I think you broke his taste buds with this one.
Whis i could get my hands on a few seeds,and grew it,even just only once
I can barely eat burger kings jalapeño poppers so my hats are off to you gents..😂
Why? Lol
10:38 thank me later
You guys lie about your actual scoeville ratings on your sauces though.   And there's controversy over pepper x as well
Cool
Bet it felt like 💩 out 🌋 on the toilet afterwards
That ........................Why..................says all you need to know about that pepper
Ed making chemical weapons on his farm
11:30 Sean was literally crying!
I want to try. 😅
This guys like the John Hammond of the pepper world
Don't you guys ever get tired of pedaling this scam?
I will grow my own..might take me 10 years.. but I will make something hot.
3:15. Such joy doing what he does. Congrats on finding what that is for you, Ed.
why only take a slice !?
Not the host of hot ones but his guests he has in this episode there trying to incurage people out there to eat a pepper that has killed a person so the people that are watching this do not I repeat do not eat pepper x because it's killed a person already and I don't want anyone else out there to die from eating pepper x
Jason Statham has a hot sauce channel?!
That comes on later when you’re in pain! 🤪
Ed genuinely enjoys the pain.
Aww as a neurodivergent i feel like Ed is one also and it is so heartwarming to see him accomplish something with his speacial interest😭
Never had a pepper X would love too. I tried a Carolina reaper and it was the most beautiful experience. Yes there's extreme burn and pain but you feel amazing after.
I don’t think Ed likes klaus
Why this video have less views 😢😢😢
I can't find the listing for this last one. 😅, i have someone who says they love it hot, so i figured to get him the hottest of the hottest,😅, can't find it tried looking in the store. Need more information
Cant help but notice Ed chewing those seeds as long as possible he knows Its better to deal with the heat in the front end where you can chew rather than the back end lol
Ya.... no thanks
The other two ate a baby green pepper lol
It’s just another day at the office for Ed.  That dude would slay in pepper-eating competitions.
Chili deserves the honor of eating a whole pepper besides the creator. Glad to have him back again!
Kinda neat how Ed just got this record but he created the pepper 10 years prior.   He’s probably gonna get 2-3 more of those.
bro why dont ed get new teeth?
The fact that Ed Currie is just standing there chilling like he just ate a sweet fruit while the others are dying is so funny
Hey Ed!.....Stop eating.
Ed's love and appreciation for his team brought more tears to his eyes than Pepper X.
7:11 I don’t care what you do, if you have this much passion … I think you are awesome.
THE REAL SPICE KING!
Great acting....
I can understand crying because you won a super bowl or you want some major game in baseball or a death in the family or you know someone save their life by becoming a Christian but not over a freaking pepper
I’m in heat ……yo that’s killing me lolol
Badass
Wow smokin ed curry has set a record im impressed and im happy for him god blessed him with such achievement
1:32 why does it look like a small hand GREDADE???  😱🔥☠💀
I am dying!!!😂😂😂
Going from “2,693,000” to seeing Ed almost tear up was an emotional rollercoaster.  What a wonderful man.
whats about a Challenge: Who can longer take the heat from any kind of chili? not eating 1 pepper. eating one pepper every x time till last man standing...
What a weak name for the hottest pepper ever created
Velveta mac and cheese with carolina reaper powder on top is amazing
"Thank you very much" I lost it 😂
Love Chili Klaus!
I have grown Carolina Reaper peppers from his seeds... I thought I could take hot... I look just like Chili Klaus. Pepper X scares me...
That has to be a brutal pepper.
He just explained that he designs a pepper not just for heat, but for flavor as well. Okay you just said it would be easy for you to make a pepper that's much hottter. If you wanted to.
How much did he have to pay for them guinness money mongers to acknowledge his work?
Ed out here creating weapons of mass destruction just for the fun of it
I'm glad you've brought Ed to the front so he can be seen. I imagine he says alot more than you see in the show. Is he always so eloquent? I'd like to think he is.
2:00 "For what we thought was the maximum" He has something hotter already, you can just tell.
At the end you can see that Ed is also feeling the heat, but he is so calm. Chili Claus is the most experienced danish chili eater and he burned up in this one. Ed, Please visit Chili Claus in Denmark for some chili eatings. Would be a blast.
ed currie has a weird arrogance
Oak and pencil?!🤣🤣🤣
Ahh yes just guys being dudes
Seeing ed this emotional when he get the record shows how much this means to him
magic peppers
Next one: Pepper Y me?
That is going to hurt even more coming out.. I would never let the origin of my being experience that..
I wonder if he's got hotter in the war chest
Klaus took the world hottest deuce later that day.
How can they eat that thing 😢
Ironic he doesn’t want his pepper to be stolen.
Sean with the fake out, then eats a sliver. No judgment from me.
He’s breeding is great
6:45 Him showing the hair of his hand going up is such a wholesome moment, well worth the hard work buddy, enjoy
This guy in the cap is not human 😂!
Imagine if that pepper scientist chose another field of science to advance humanity toward more heat, Nuclear Bio Ai 😂 that man's as cold as Agent 47
The fear in Sean's voice as this episode starts I knew he was gonna get rocked 😂
There's no fun in that.
I'm such a fan of Hot Ones.  Sean is easily the best interviewer out there. No one else, on TV, podcast, or any format, even comes close.  Smokin' Ed...what can you say about this guy?  He's the mad scientist who gave us the Carolina Reaper and the Pepper X, and somehow he's immune to all of it.  While the others are melting down, he's calmly giving us a deep dive on the flavor analysis.  And then there's Chili Klaus.  The way he contorts his face, snaps his fingers, and somehow keeps it together just makes me smile.
I like Sean but he kind of pooned out with the sliver❤😂
Ed’s endorphin system automatically kicks in when he starts talking about hot peppers…so that when he goes to eat a few, he’s already on a natural high and feels no pain.
Why is Sean not eating the whole one like Klaus?
Well done to Ed. A really sweet moment with the Guiness certificate 😍😍  imScott 🤓🤓
He’s in heat like a female dog
Please tell me he lived.
It's weird I am no way saying I'm a chili head..but when doing crazy spices or say the 1 chip which I have done..I never get the hiccups..but hate the ears part 100%
Ed is a superhero.
Not spicy😂😂😂
So I hear milk doesn't really work when eating hot peppers. Is this true?
Fred Guinness wasn't available?
All 4 of you; still crazy.  : )
Ed is the kind of guy I'd love to work with.
😊😊😊 Great Job Yaw  😊😊😊
💛🖤
So guy's have you try Pepper X i search video of it , i guest only few people were chosen for the hottest chilli eater
I bought the sauce, and it's delicious.  Hats off!
I love how Ed casually explains how insanely hot Pepper X is. For everyone, it's a fight or flight response. But for him, it’s just another day at the office.
The creator of the pepper was straight BOSSIN' that pepper.
12:50 and 12:54 I think is the closest we’ll ever get to seeing Ed lose his composure. This spice must be the real deal
Pepper extracts are unnatural
Ed released a video today where he was reviewing some hot sauces on Epicurious. He said there’s another new pepper that’s hotter than his that’s going to come out soon.
Lock him up!
Funnily enough,... drink a Guinness and the heat from the pepper is gone.
Have watched this a bunch of times, but the combination of Klaus, Sean and Ed is just a winning combo..  I love it.  Greetings from Denmark
Pepper X is the beginning of 'I LOVe You'. I = 9 L = 12 = 1+2 = 3 O = 15 = 1+5 = 6 V = 22 Pepper X, the 'I Love You' pepper.
None of the last dab sauces are hotter than maddog 357. Why is that?
Hahaha😂 thanks for being team player. Hahaha, "I am in heat"
Ed Curry always happy unless he is moved by the effort of his team.
Did you know that lemon extract helps cancel out the fire
That looked freaking miserable. I can't believe there are people who do this to themselves for fun.
Ed you legend. You took something you loved and made it your life and now your world known and a legend. Well done sir. Well done
The worst part has got to be coming out the other end
I got to get my hands on some seeds. It's time.
I don't know...If somebody is eating Pepper X, and its burning their soul, the last thing in their mind would be flavour.
Can we make a pepper spray using this pepper?
bro is pepper scientist
Viola Davis, Joel Embid.....they took real bites! So many sissies on your show that nibble & tap out
Ow and ed going mmm lets casualy enjoi this wile evry one is dieing 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Te scofield value 😮😮😮😮😮😮 i would be so scared
Looks like one of Satan's testicles ngl
Why? 🤣🤣🤣
Is Ed Currie an evil genius?  Like, what are we gonna do today, Ed? We’re going to take over the world!
Ed getting choked up over the record but not his pepper is everything. And how quick he was to mention his team! What an absolute legend.
Ed isn’t impressive.  His taste buds are obviously either dead or completely broken. To eat this and not bat an eye says that you have REALLY bad taste.
"im in heat!" 😂😂😂😂
Like you ate a grenade and then it exploded?
I don’t like pain
Totally insanely hot
I love how Ed looks almost completely unaffected.
This lovely case of Klaus not being a native English speaker and getting a new classical phrase with "I'm in heat!" - he does not understand it means something else, he wants to tell everyone it is spicy!
I got weird tingling in my head like when your foot falls asleep and then the blood rushes back one of the times I ate a real potent, very fresh Reaper from Melissa's. I did a fresh reaper and fresh ghost pepper video each season when I had my store.  That one in particular did something beyond just immense pain.  It was a physiological reaction that brought me to the point of almost blacking out.  I was on the verge.
Congratulations Guys! Instead of calling your wonderful creation Pepper X.. I would have called it Demon's Bile . 😂
Both Da Bomb and Mad Dog 357 are hotter than this sauce...it's been tested
I’d be more impressed with a super fragrant paprika pepper…
In one word Klaus nails it: WHY
How is the Scoville scale logarithmic? It's not.
Ed Curry is the GOAT!
Wow!
I wish AI could create Chili Claus Kinski.  Watching Claus Kinski react to a hot pepper would be epic!
looking at these 4 gentlemen one would really wonder, men are so complicated
At the end of this video when he said, “be careful around your eyes” the very first thing I thought of was “and don’t go to the bathroom!”
OK where is @GMM with trying this pepper?
Im telling my kids Klaus there is Santa. Theres no way its a coincidence 😂😂😂
Ed eating a 2.63 MILLION SHU pepper the same way I eat a cherry tomato blows my mind.
When I end up eating super spicy stuff, I end up sneezing like crazy, with lots of hiccups in between.  I don't know if that's natural, but it's a really really miserable experience.
I would like to test myself against pepper X on your channel
This makes my stomach hurt.
Congratulations to the team for getting into the Guinness Book of World Records….. what an amazing achievement….. 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Before actual people can have their hands on the actual pepper, it won't be the hottest pepper in the world.   It's like the best album in the world, but the band only released a demo of it.
Chili klaus is a GANGSTER
If the pepper x is three times hotter then the caroline reaper. You can probably use that in warfare lol
Sure scovilles doesn't stack, but the heat absolutely does. Ed can't deny that. It's again, the scientific logic against actual life.
I was a particularly big fan of Ed's comment, "I've got a little tear in my eye" surrounded by the others completely losing their sh*t.
TEDWARD THE CHILI CLOWN
Pepper X does not exist!!
So, basically edible pepper spray
Check out howtown's hot one's video, it shows that these sauces - while spicy aren't the spiciest - the #8 sauce is still the spiciest hot sauce since it has the highest concentration of capsacin
Your awesome Ed we love your peppers 🌶️ ❤
Weird idea but I wonder what mind of perfumery could be done using pepper x
Guinness world records does give out a lot of phony records these days but i think the original creators would be proud of this one
11:36 cue the snaps 😂
Ed is the Nick Saban of peppers. The voice the dedication is spot on 😭
Experience sauce has only 64k scovile score not in millions, its the scoville score of actual pepper that’s used to make that sauce
Congrats you are officially awesome. Took for us to tell ya “Guinness”
I’m currently growing a Carolina reaper plant … man these peppers 🌶️ are hot 🔥
Klaus: "I think there's some oak in it... and pencil" Sean: "yeah, definitely pencil" + "i'm in heat" has to be some of the funniest I've heard in a while
Sean really let us down on this one
This guy that creates these peppers 🌶️ is a mad 😠 scientist 👨‍🔬 😂
12:32 😅
One recipe i make to put next to my food.  A few carolina reapers, a few onions, vinegar and some garlic. Put it all in a blender, and blent it till it becomes like all very tiny little chunks. Add some more vinegar, and let it sit for a day ot two. 1 or 2 teaspoons with your meal is literal fire.
I'M IN HEAT 😭😭😭😭🔥🔥🔥
Man did he get his teeth from a horse?
He is right.A lot of people will try to steal the recipe all the brand..... You have to protect it..
I’ve had hot sauce made with Pepper X. It hurts.
I am in heat!
Love smell of carolina reaper, taste is nice too. But its so hot, it will burn you for 15-30 mins
I feel like there was a lot more comments about the primotali a year ago when this come out.. cant find none now!
Ed's just a treasure, gotta love him
Chocolate primotalii and warthog are hotter
12:13 💀💀💀
these guys are certified madmen
I want some!!!!❤
Grow up
Idiots
CONGRATULATIONS ED BIG FAN IF YOURS YOUR A COOL DUDE
Congratulations!
12:16 The indigence on Klaus's face when Ed says "no real throat burn"...
Pronouncing his name “Claws” is hilarious.
Ed was crying more from receiving the world record than actually eating the pepper
Klaus is a beast....
I could feel Klaus’ distress and panic through my screen 😱
Ed seems to be a really down to earth guy not flashy or conside blue collar guy
Come on Sean Evans why did you check it out and let everybody else have the fun?! 10:48
Smoking at a living, legend 7:44
congrats to Ed for his record, and for showing us he is in fact a human. Millions of scoville can't shake him, but the love and pride of his team's hard work brings him to tears. Just love it, dude is awesome
Ed’s pain tolerance is unreal
Take my like
Sean, if you're not willing to eat a whole pepper, stay home.
Taste like a pencil is crazy😂😂😂😂
this is the best episode. I don't want it to be that way because the others are so fun and entertaining but the endearing vulnerability and life time passion that lifts the burden can't be beat. thank you for this episode.
I’ve had the last dab xperience. Super hot sauce. I’ve only done a teaspoon as of now, and it was hot
Shoulda made Guinness guy eat one
ed looks like he tastes like a cinnabun
😅😂😂 Absolutely Hilarious 😅😂😂🤣my head is swelling just from contact Heat High 😊
Props for how calm he was the entire time…. He slowly talked us through, what he thought was his demise.😂
I'll never understand why people put themselves through this!
That was hilarious.  They must be insane.
I’m gonna get the hot sauce
fraudsters
How can that dude talk about flavors when describing something that's inedible because it causes imeadiate and severe pain. Describing how the pepper flavors pair well with certain foods when in truth it does nothing but ruin any type of dining experience is Straight BS. they should describe the flavor as battery acid, lightning bolts, and slowly burning to death in a cauldron of boiling sewer water. I don't get it. I have tasted an extremely hot pepper before and unknowingly touched different parts of my body. It was an experience I'll never forget and would never voluntarily put myself through ever again. Once was one to many times. Flavor....GTFOH!!
Aside from adding the guiness world of fraudsters in for zero reason this was a nice video.
Just so everyone knows, the Scoville rating of the hot sauce is only 5% of pepper X due to dilution to make the sauce.
Ed is a legend
I like Ed a lot. I just found some videos of him yesterday didn’t even realize he was the guy who made pepper X. Seems humble and genuine and he’s funny. Best of luck to him on his next hottest pepper. God Bless.
Pearly gates😂
How ironic, the dude that cultivated the worlds hottest pepper got the chills receiving an award for it.
Celebrating my 50th with a Hot-One's challenge with 100 friends and family tomorrow.  I have 3 bottles of the Pepper X Final Dab, on line & t-shirts for those that complete all 10 sauces.  Can't wait!!!  (thank you for creating such an incredible journey and experience for myself and our guests) - :)
scoville is like watts, it dont   add up
The others: "Aaaah im dying thats so painful, im burning up" Ed: "I got a little bit of a tear in my eye"
Ed:  We have the spiciest pepper in the world.  Chili Klaus shows up:  Ed:  It's really not that spicy.......  It's spicier.
Ed: "Guys I am suffering too. There's a little tear coming out of my eye" LOLOLOLOLOLO
the morning after is gonna be very fun
You should have a spin-off called "Afterburn", showing the toilet effects on guests! I would watch that any day!!!🎉🎉🎉
Chili claus is starting to lose his melanin
I eat ghost pepper sauce on a semi-regular basis (I use a few dabs in tacos, burritos, etc) along with some other more moderate (habanero) sauces. I've tried a Reaper based sauce once and it was just unenjoyable. With this? Nah, I'd be screaming twice... Once when it goes in, and the next when it comes out...
I always love Chili Klaus’ reactions but Ed looking like he didn’t even eat one was absolutely surreal!
Is there any Scottish single malt to go along with any spicy pepper, hotter than habanero?
that guy is a hero ahahahahah
watching ed being able to eat a whole carolina reaper without winking and getting locked up after the award says alot. This man really worked his heart out for it
Ed is an absolute machine the way he took the heat from that pepper! Sean's face instantly went red, Klaus looked like he got shot in the gut, Noah actually handled it really well too, but Ed... Man, that was impressive
I just wanna be best friends with Ed
Watching Ed narrate what everyone is going through, whilst going through it himself, is one of my top spicy pleasures. Currie is a certified G.
Nobody handles heat better than ED..except LORDE lol Iykyk
OH THE DRAMA
They still didn’t explain how they measured it to get the figures. I didn’t understand the creators repose about taking water out?
3 of them (1 in particular) dying, and Ed just calmly talking about how it tastes and what effect it is having.  Honestly hilarious.
“I’m in heat” ok me too you’re not special xD
Can you get Johnny Scoville to do it with you?
Nice acting and marketing campaign.
Cannabis edible activation time: one hour  Ed Currie's edible activation time: five minutes ago
"d-d-did you invent that peppa'?"... "yeah!"...."why?!"
I’ve seen a few vids of Ed now and he seems such a genuine nice guy.
I am from.landnofbghostnpepper northeast, india. Good job guys❤🎉🎉🎉😂😂😂
hahahahahahah 😂 they should have eaten the pepper while awarding the Guinness plaque 😂
Nobody going to talk about how they don't have water or milk
Tasting wine: slightly angular flavor. Earthy but with a nice citrus aftertaste.   Tasting peppers: Tastes like pencils and violence.
Algorithm keeps suggesting Ed videos.  I like that.
I planted these peppers. I love it.
нашелся достойный соперник. это битва будет легендарной - хотя нет , я просто сьем его и все)
2 hours!?
Imagine if the peppers were fully matured???!!
That pepper looks like it does NOT want to be eaten
…. “I like the way people look really scared from eating my hot sauce..” 😏  I bet you do sir, I bet you do. 😂
Chili Klaus is one of my favorite people on the internet ever. This poor guy just gets lit up endlessly.
No one discusses what it feels like when you excrete it - that seems wrong.
What's the trade-off from eating these? Do you dull other aspects of your palette - potentially permanently or increase sensitivity? I wouldn't want to lose umami just so I could tolerate hotter and hotter sauce, that seems self-defeating.
12:33  pause
If no one can enjoy the pepper then what’s the point? I’ll stick to Serrano
"WHY!?" 😂
Missing out on things like this is one of the few things in life I'm jealous of. I'm immune to capcaisin, something to do with my genetics and my trpv receptors. So I can eat a phaal curry and to me it's no different to eating a korma. I don't get any heat at all, nothing. I've eating naga chilli's whole and its the same as eating a green bell pepper people put in salads. Just no sensation of heat whatsoever.   That being said, I do feel it on the way out 😂 but I still don't get that head rush or feeling of heat like normal people do.  I've had people in the past tell me to enter chilli eating contests and such, but as I said above, I still feel it on the way out, so I don't think eating 20 reapers in a minute would be a great idea.  The only things I can feel heat from is mustard, cinnamon black/white pepper and and I think that's a different compound in that compared to chilli peppers.
me being a spice lover, i wanna try this RIGHT NOW the heat is what I live for🔥🌶❤️‍🔥
Protect this man at all cost.
Wild.
“I’m in heat”
Klaus is what 60% of the population would actually be like if they tried this pepper
My a****** started to burn by just watching this😂
Always a good time lol
"Did you really invent that? [yea]... Why?" HAHA 13:50
I love it when Claus said “ WHY”
What about the Ghost pepper???
I want that guy who eats chillis with not mamma jamma sauce with all other chilli extracts on top to say this and not bat an eye
I wish Sean had done the whole pepper
Nope
I am klaus 🌶️ 😂
I am klaus 😂 at the end 😂of the
"im in... HEAT".... i love that klaus couldnt find the word (i imagine he tried to say "im on fire" or smth like that) and all bro managed to get out was smth about the heat... but it came out like he's a cat in heat LOL
Ed looks extremely calm because dude probably eats hot peppers pretty regularly at his farm, so you naturally build up a tolerance to spice the more you intake it. i can only imagine the endorphin rush ED is feeling right now and as a chili head myself, its something i only dream of experiencing one day.
Habaneros did this to me many years ago. No way I'd try this Pepper X. Bravo guys!
Nothin is quite like watching 4 grown men engaged in a 'Colon destruction party '.......
Ed be like " i eat pepper and drink pepper". Anything else is obsolete.
Theres only one Smokin’ and it’s Joe Frazier.
"it continues"😂
Netflix should do a movie about Ed's life
Like this comment if you are very unhappy Sean didn't eat a whole pepper. We need a redo
Ed fix  you’re teeth..  man you got the opportunity living in USA and enough money please take care of yourself !! Our health begins in the mouths if are mouth is unhealthy it just sets up for more unhealthy issues as you go.
so there is no chili in the world that can make Big Ed break out in tears. Shouldn´t that be a world record in itself? 😆
NO ESCAPE FOREVER STOP PLAYING Luke 16:24 KJVS And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.
Ed was really getting emotional 🥲
😂😂😂😮😅
now your now what the gollum felt!
Sean you have to eat one bro I'll do it if you do
somebody get them boys some chairs 😂😂😂😂😂
This aged like fine wine
Yes smoke kin ed curry give it to them..
If I was 4 years younger, I would have seen Sean in our highschool lol. Crystal lake central was where we both went and his senior class photo is up on the walls as well as everyone’s senior photo since 1928. Crazy to think I just missed seeing him walk the halls 😂
How long before we can get them to grow like the reaper? I want!
I always stop to watch this.. probably seen it 50 times.. but I still stop every time. Klaus is too funny
According to the chili heads that eat these peppers, the hottest is now The Warthog!
This pepper has been in storage for a decade. Let’s let that simmer for a second. . . . A decade.   This isn’t the last pepper he’s got that’s been in storage. He’s probably got 3 or 4 more that he’s just sitting on. Brilliant business strategy. He’s waiting to see if someone wants to rival him…..and then he’s already got them beat.
@12:27 Klaus is gestating a fire baby 😅
I would try it but my *hole doesn't allow anything over longhorn pepper.
But let's be honest...that's something only high school kids try to do, to act tough or to pose in front of girls. Where's the enjoyment in that? No one is going to eat it because it tastes good or because they like it a bit spicier.
Are the seeds available yet?
Where can I buy said pepper?....
Why's the sauce only 60k scovilles then?
At 11:58 Klaus actually makes the Dark Souls death sound.
I'll try it
We need to get this pepper to Rhett and Link ASAP.
You should imvite someone from Guyana or South Asians, like India, Pakistan.  Your pepper X is nothing to those guys.  They'll munch on it for  snack.  😂😂😂😂😂
Not a lot of benign mad scientist out there
Why would people even enjoy these peppers
Are we going to get a hotter paper? Is it in the works? And, if so, WHY!? 🤣
This is why women live longer than men 😂
Why anybody should eat this it makes no sense
All Legends
smokin ed currie not even fazed mans got a stomach made of titanium
Love how Ed is so casual about it. Like the dude seems to eat those peppers on every meal he has
They look like they took some serious drugs😂😂
Two hours later?!!!??!….(makes one wonder when the endorphins will kick in)???—-people,that’s incredible!!!🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵
Getting high with chillis😂😂
love the snapping!
Congrats to Smokin' Ed and his team but.....a bit late but im not too proud of Sean for not taking a whole pepper... I'm not mad... just dissapointed
Im just watching this and I’m afraid to touch my eyes.
I eat this hot sauce everyday.  It's amazing.  Love the flavor and the overall heat.
Talk to Troy Primo (;
Ed getting choked up while talking about his Pepper X is so sweet. The man (and his crew) are so passionate about what they do, it’s super awesome.
There is a reason Ed is last with chewing.
Poor chili 😂😂😂lol
NO THANK YOU!!! You people seem like pepper-masochists! This whole video is perverse!
Who had cartman farting fire pop into their head
Pepper X , 3.18 million SHU ,
I would love to grow this pepper, and its very sad that he is not selling the peppers or seeds.
My god.
hahahaha watching Klaus short-circuit made my day. Poor guy is awesome.
seems like ed is not a fan of brushing his teeth lol
Him rubbing his head starring at the pepper thinking about all the decisions he's made in life 😂
🎉🎉🎉 congratulations Ed
These guys are Legendary. There is no way I would eat a whole pepper x.
Thanks Ed my insides are melting
Ed saving the day with the commentary like an absolute champ!
Amazing, that all 3 are wearing long sleeves.
I’ve eaten pepper x curry in the uk made by them
Do you get the same sensation when the pepper comes out? 🚻
So Ed likes hurting people? Is that the point? JT
Ed absolutely handled this like a boss😂😂😂
The King 👑my hero
was it spicy?
How can you not get explosive diarrhea for days?!!!
That's OK. I'll watch other people in pain. They' just scared me.
Poor klaus this man was dying 😂
Investing in a new high rn lol
Need to see more Chilli Klaus 😂
I got in my mind the im in heaaat😂😂😂
Klaus is the MVP
I love Smokin Ed Currie, such a nice man. Good luck on the next pepper sir.
Hva fan Claus, du virkede ikke helt på toppen🥵😂
That is the definition or rather the pure essence of eating spicy food and reacting accordingly
“I’m in heat”
@trychannel
Not really sure why anyone would enjoy that.
😂
So I'm assuming all the online adds selling pepper x seeds are scams?
I love watching honest people win.
Pukerbutt should look into some whitening tooth paste😳😳
I love how Ed is just calmly chewing, with a smile, while the other guys are dying inside. :D
What a wonderful thing to do on the show. You can really see how much he works on his passion. Congratulations
If Klaus cant handle it you know its hot af. Ill pass. 😂😂
I just bought the sauce i am scared
I did a teaspoon of Da' Bomb just for giggles. Regretted that for a good 45 minutes. Like gargling fire.
Congratulations Ed and Team
Way to Smoking ED
Carolina is hot enough for me.
Klaus said that pepper wasn’t fully mature then Ed said I’m not gonna hurt you Klaus… so was it not at the full hotness?
Absolutely priceless😂
Its logarithmic
Once that validation sets in, it becomes a whole nother beast.
But his sauces are all scam?
Ed's a cool guy.
Hmmmm, Andy doesn't want a bite???
So cool to See Ed take a moment to gather himself before sharing his thoughts. You can tell how much passion goes into what he does and his love for his team.
Dude.. I make  a few different hot sauces at  home that will rock your world lol.
Bruh I'm not a spice person i start sweating just watching these vids
this man feels about peppers the way bubbles thinks of kitties, the real ones know what I'm saying lol.
This is so heart warming. It also looks heartburning. 😆
I ate a little hot pepper, I am causing resuscitation - Meanwhile, people - Я съел немного острый перец вызываю реанимацию - Тем временем люди -
Chili Klaus is my favorite
I have a ten year old carolina reaper plant who's given me many babies and so so many peppers
Lol this is a joke the pepper is not probably no where near as hot as they put on or else he would have others try it and prove it but he isn't only released a weak sauce plz ed is a fony
Oak and pencil, what a lovely flavor!
Brilliant!!! 🤣🤣🤣
Klaus walking out was a surprise :D
Some people say Ed has a twisted sick mind but deep inside he's kind and friendly.
Imagine have rhinitis and eating this...success! hahahahaha
That "I think there's some oak in it"  was one of the most painfully said things i have ever heard 😂
I would have loved to have seen Ed Curry's grow before he got busted.
I think Klaus was gonna say he is in a new heat dimension (never explored before) 😂
Ed needs the slogan "im the man that wants to watch the world burn" lol
I want to try eating one!!  Challenge accepted!
Bring chase the heat on this show.
Pepper X marijuana
Good to see that Klaus didn´t die
For once I wish Sean would stop talking
two people are breaking down, meanwhile this guy is monologing "yea I'm feeling it too"  ...bro, what are you even made of?
Ed is a poser attention seeker.
Didn’t Ed Currie steal pepper X?
These guys are just insane man..
The more spice that ed is able to cram into these peppers the more evil they look
Ed is insane dude, that guy creates masterpieces
Isn't this dangerous? 🔥
So that means no one can actually buy a pepper X and use it whether it’s hole or chop it up and do anything with it protecting the pepper and the only way you can get it. I guess it’s just a bottle that makes me sad Carolina. I have this that I want to sit there and eat one of these pets, and it’s a little sad to me, but I might not be able to have that opportunity ever I guess unless I become buddies
Ed is the truth that didn’t even phase him crazy
not much relevance to the culinary experience if your sensors burn out
“I’m in heat” 😂🔥😂🔥😂🔥😂🔥😆
ED YOUR THE MAN !
Da bomb beyond insanity is king no matter what these guys make
I like this guy Ed he loves and cares about what he does
7:10 When we all cried with Ed
Ed really wants people to look at his forearms
Ed’s sheer passion and devotion to the peppers makes me so happy to know that he’s the sole owner of all of it . If you can imagine your boss being so invested and sticking to core values and being so happy to talk about the product . Who wouldn’t work under them? Love it and wish nothing but continued success to this insane human being 😂
What's the point?
Can’t believe Adam the host of this show wouldn’t eat a full wing with that hot sauce, dude this is literally your job
So the real point of eating these is for the experience?  Obviously it's not the taste if it immediately goes away and then just torture.
I think when a pepper gets to the point where it doesn't even taste good and it's simply too spicy to consume in any fashion then it isn't really good for anything. I think "Pepper X" would find better use as an ingredient in mace or something rather than a food.
To Ed Currie, his fans and workers. Congratulations.   And to the corporations who are trying to take Ed's work... F*** you.
Gotta be honest.... the last dab isn't as hot as the Chocolate Plague. The last Dab, I can eat a lot of without it building heat, perhaps due to its inclusion of Tumeric, which is anti-inflammatory.
If you're can't eat spicy food, don't try this sh** .  And Don't try to prank your friend with this
It's funny no one could beat the Carolina Reaper, so Ed did it himself
He’s gotten fame and money from his show on making others eating hot wing and he would not eat on pepper that’s suss
Never....
sean shoulda done the whole pepper come on now!!
Did that tool describe it's flavour as "duskier"? Not a word fucko.
Some hundred years after a hypothetical apocalypse, a lone child of a nomadic tribe stumbles upon a farmland in South Carolina. There, the child injests the devil's fruit through the mouth. That child has yet ever tasted anything spicy in its life, lest it's five consecutive previous generations of ancestors. Reborn, a new Silver Surfer to the Spice Lord emerges.
Pepper X? Dude needs Dentist X.
I didn’t realize how inhuman ed is until eating a whole ghost pepper today. Dude is an absolute beast
I put Tabasco on most of my food not to brag just I like hot food. Honestly I've never tried this pepper but I really feel like I could eat several of these not a problem. Maybe I'm wrong but I've ate jalapeno pepper whole like nothing and also Serrano so I don't think a pepper can get too much hotter than those but who knows
I’ve came to the conclusion that Ed is a lunatic
Ed probably also has the world record for spice tolerance
Every time a new hottest pepper comes out they look even more like they were made by satan
Beautiful.
The invention of Pepper X invites the inventions of Peppers Y and Z.
Great acting
It's not the hottest pepper and they know it.  Warthog all day baby
How is ed just laughing he's a monster for eating that that whole thing and he is just acting normally
Was the medical staff standing by😂😂😂 you know just in case one of them dropped. I bet the next time Sean calls Klaus he does answer.
Sean should have eaten more but acted like he ate an entire pepper.
Welcome to 2024- the year of getting a High on Peppers 🌶️ 🫑 🥵😂🔥🥵😂🔥
A come up?! 😂 let me explain what is happening when you eat HOT 🥵 PEPPERS 🌶️  in the simplest way …   (The consumption of these foods releases endorphins and dopamine. This creates euphoria similar to a “runners high.” Or a uppers high)  🔥✅🔥✅🔥✅🔥
Why didn't sean eat a whole one?
Ed is a monster
Absolute animals.
Oh no what happened?🤯😄
Pepper Y will delay for bull fertilizer reasons.
That pepper X even looks kinda evil. 😅
12:49 ed‘s only reaction😂😂
Ed is the worst trip sitter lol
Ed has such a dry sense of humor i love him
I started laughing so hard as soon as Sean started talking after eating the pepper. It was so obvious how unpleasant it felt immediately. 🤣🤣🤣
The pepper must be much hotter than the sauce..
I have purchased from Ed before and I have the gator sauce with the pepper X in it and it is truly one of the most delicious hot sauces. It is extremely hot by all means but it is delicious. I’m just a little dab will do you and it’s definitely fun to share with friends I would recommend, anyone get yourself a bottle and share the experience with your friends
11:10 why does Klaus sound like an owl 😂
bring this chilly to north east India we would love to try the hottest chilly
Ed is "feeling the same burn" but talking in a calm, even tone and not even a tear. 😅
10:23 the silence and the laughs 😂
Love Chili Klaus!❤
It would be good to see certain regions of south asia that produces ghost pepper try this and see how it is different. They are one of the professionals when it comes to tasting hot peppers.
Just had my first Carolina Reaper of the year ripen from seeds straight from Ed’s company. That was a remarkably delicious pepper. It blew scorpions and ghosts away in heat but the flavor was on point. After eating a slice i cooked the rest into a delicious meal. Love your work Ed! These chiles give me the best buzz i’ve ever had!
Why didn’t Sean have a whole one?
Too bad this isn't really the hottest pepper, otherwise numerous chili channels would have gotten them to review how insane they are...
Smokin Ed lives down the street from me. It’s weird seeing a famous guy at the grocery store on a regular basis.
Ed seems mildly inconvenienced by the experience...
Hot Ones is proof that First We Feast is THE YouTube channel for Hot Sauce lovers.
Ed has all his taste buds dead already, it would seem like he were eating a hamburger, how  does he do it? it's insane.
“It continues…” - Chili Klaus
Chili is the most huggable looking man on earth.
Even Johnny Scoville didn't eat this
That's a man who loves his job
6 MILLION views already and only posted 10 minutes ago???? Nicely done!
Already a hotter pepper out now. THE WARTHOG!!!!
Great watch start to finish !
Cool but come on and release the seeds to the World!
Do you know what is ironic about this? Chili Klaus is from Denmark (a country that banned Korean fire noodles deeming them too spicy).
He needs Johnny Scoville on here
I'm still gonna call it Pepper Twitter. F*ck Elon.
Wow how time flies. Klaus is all silver now! Awesome guy, great to see him again
At what point will these be deadly like Pepper Z at 10million SHU
From what I understand this guy beat addiction with passion and that's awesome 😎
Congratulations Ed. The guy is living proof that no matter what you do, even if it's growing peppers, be good at what you do and it will pay off.
I tried the Last Dab sauce and immediately felt the heat and began sweating for an hour. It really transformed what was once a bland plain pizza slice.
This is BS. It’s not the hottest pepper in the world. (if it even exists) And these people are all being paid to do this. Stop being so gullible America. These people are after one thing and that’s your money. And by clicking, liking, and following, they get paid.
I think this one was hotter than his Danish sister 🤣
Chase the heat, Johnny Scoville says the warthog is Hotter then even his favorite  I have the Hottest pepper! To be released by thanksgiving look for it!
How do you know Pepper X is the hottest pepper in the world? I highly doubt it
Ed is the man, Johnny Scoville jealousy is getting out of hand 😂😂
Anyone who actually knows anything about peppers knows there’s quite a few peppers hotter then the reaper and that the Scoville isn’t always accurate at gauging the hottest peppers
"I'M IN HEAT" 🥵😭🥵😂  He gave birth to a PENCIL ✏️
My reaper is definitely not average
This is not the world's hottest pepper!! Independent labs have tested pepper x hot sauce, that contains over 90% pepper x. Have found the sauce alone is in the 65,000k Scoville Heat Units. Therefore pepper x, can not claim to be the world's hottest pepper. Guinness World's records is not the gatekeeper of facts, Ed Curry knows this all is a scam, 10yrs he's claimed to have been growing out the pepper to a stable F8+ phenom type. Still won't release one pod, seed or plant to the public. Therefore, pepper x is a scam until the above mentioned changes.
Nobody takes Guinness serious.
Phony pepper hyped on lies, cmon now
Wow I think I would hiccup for 5 minutes then die ☠️ 😜
1:32 that’s nothing more than a Mustard  Moruga Brainstrain
1:00 his war chest of stolen pepper seeds he didn’t create? He’s literally known for renaming other ppls peppers whos to say he didn’t get seeds for pepper D from Mike Gardners farm and call them Pepper x the reason he called it pepper D is to clown Ed cuz he claimed pepper x was the hottest 10 years ago then nothing happened
I had a sliver of a fresh carolina reaper, this is nuts
All you clowns who believe this and believe Ed created the worlds hottest pepper are uneducated
I’ve never heard of Chili Klaus who is he a friend of Ed’s I don’t see any murderers row where’s Johnny Scoville or the Scoville unit? Who are these nobody’s? I guarantee they were okay’d by Ed Currie cuz he’s a fraud and he needs to make sure they will say his new stolen pepper is the hottest I’m telling you the C-3PO is 3 million SHU peaks it 3.5 million SHU
Can you call this a murderers row? Where is Johnnie Scoville where is the Scoville unit? Where is the chili King who was a fraud anyways but I’ve never heard of these people who are these people people you paid people who can eat Chili’s are they friends of Ed’s they must be I guarantee it. I’ve never heard of any of these people if.Ed was serious. He would have one person out there, trying his pepper Johnny Scoville, but he doesn’t because he knows Johnny Scoville will tell the truth and he will say it’s not the hottest pepper in the world. The warthog is the hottest pepper in the world right now other than maybe the C-3PO or the zing or the RB 003 or the massacre pepper or the Primotalii
You guys are brave!!!
Ed is a beast
Is the pepper guy differently abled mentally? Trying not to offend or use r word.
Dude, the chocolate buhtla blows your pepper x out of the water.  They got some great hot peppers but I can think of several that are hotter easily
I've been tattooing for 25 plus years, and I still get bothered by how much pain I put people in. This guy is the devil
Klaus is the man
What's the culinary experience you're trying to create? Hate. The answer is hate.
Puckerbutt Pepper Co. Is in Fort Mill, one mile from where I live! I had a drink at Hobos today!
Ed said look i have a tear in my eye ha ha ha
Then sell it you have so much of pepper x 😂  I’m actually breeding mutated dna peppers cut stem lol
Ed just standing there poker face and even smiling at their pain XD I freaking cant
I had the world's hottest in 2014 . It was miserable
It’s great and all but something that hot is just not right to eat.
SC!! The hottest State!!!!
It's hard to believe ANYTHING can melt Sean's insides.
12:09 Ed "Oh NO😮😅😂Whats going on" 😂😂😂😂
Poor Klaus
Ed is such a genuinely nice guy
10 months on and still no one can eat this pepper. The sauce is OK, but seems to lack the heat that the label promises. It's certainly not in the millions of SHUs.  C'mon! Give us the pepper!
The Freshness just goes away immediately..  yeah thats because you are now being blasted in the face full bore with a flamethrower LOL
Chili Klaus is just the best!   The most interesting pepper man in the world  :D
It continues....
💀😭😭🤣🤣🤣
This sauce is a sham!
Ed Currie is a schmuck who takes credit for Tony Primo’s work
Ed Currie is a con man
I love Ed!  His carolina reaper video was awesome and at the end he did say if anybody beats this I have another.  Must of been pepper x!  As a gardener anyone could do this.  Probably cant beat Ed with pepper unless your going sweet maybe, but with tomatoes radish corn squash onion anything!  You can breed your own unique creation!
"Did you invent that pepper?"  "Yes" "WHY!?" 😂
I cannot even imagine what pain they were going through... THE NEXT DAY!
No where near as hot as the Deadpool pepper or primotalli
@pepperpaul714
This was so wholesome 🥰
Dude is the heatking
Dude is the heat king! He ate the same thing as chilli swash
Real question, what do they do to figure out the scoville level?
Perfect ad just played. As Ed got emotional about the record, an ad cut in, it was capital one and she goes, “are you crying? There’s no crying in baseball” couldn’t be more perfect tbh 😂
Sean reminds me of dude from breaking bad "tight, tight, tight, tiiiight"
Does this mean I can finally buy some pepper x seeds???
When a guy called Chili Claus is asking why you made a chilli that hot, you have to ask yourself some serious questions
That Office Toilet deserves a Guiness World Record. Worlds most spiceyest afterburner.
If you look at his teeth, you'll know he's had a few of them. Guy doesn't have a normal pain response to pepper, got his super power nailed to his profession.
True passion. Well done!
Masarap Sauces. Amazing
So touching when Ed was so overwhelmed with joy. So happy for him.
Ed is smiling like Emperor Palpertine/Darth Sidious
the real challenge is in the toilet
Oh my good lord
2025 hot chip challenge about to be Wild 🔥 🥵
Imagine the BUUUUURRRRRNNN when it comes out the other end!!!!!😮😮😮😮😮
If these guys react this way towards this pepper, I’d be on the floor the minute the pepper touched my lip. 🥵😂
Ed has learned to manage the heat. 😎
Top video I’ll be swerving that pepper 🤣 scotch bonnet is my limit
I love the involuntary stabbing motion Sean does when explaining the violent flavor. :D
I grew up in Fort Mill, SC and still live pretty close! I need to go visit his store. What a great guy! It shows what kind of man he is for acknowledging his team so much. I’m so glad this has been such a success for them all❤
Im in HEAT LOL
Het Conan O’Brien to try this pepper pleaseeee
14:00 Hes the MAN
Poor klaus 😂😂
🙋🏼‍♀ Well deserved Ed.
Could have named it cow killer.
Ed seems tough but fair. I am sure he can be a pain to work for but a visionary has standards. Congratulations Ed on your creation! I have had your pepper via Heatonist and it is tasty, albeit a little regulated to novelty due to: "just try it, it's an experience."
lol klaus is breeding  haha
Hottest in the world? Idk iv had some spicy jalapeños lol
Watching Hot Ones makes me want to eat spicy food, more like normal food but adding spicy sauses on top of it. Then i do that. Then i come back to Hot Ones after couple weeks, when i forget all that pain, so i can do that again.
Ed choking up and giving props to his team is awesome Edit: RIP Chili Klaus
I’m a Winthrop grad.  Interested that my alma mater did the testing for this.  ❤
if someone can make it happen and wants to record it i will eat a pepper x.
yeees Chili Klaus!
FUNNY!!!!!!!! I'll face the full fury of a woman before I do something like that 😅😅 I think 🤔
It's great for your memory. Next morning you get to remember what you ate before....
Havent seen chili klaus in awhile. Should have him on again and has ed ever been on to do the challenge? Smoking ed and klaus would be a great reunion episode
I’m sure there’s some handshakes and deals made behind the scenes but to have this chili guy on vs Johnny Scoville is disrespectful.
Can only imagin how bad it is on the other end...
Gotta be honest i dont believe they have a "war chest" i think they just release them as they make them
Ed is built different
😂😂😂😂
AFTERBURN OF 2 HOURS!????? ED YOU SADISTIC MF. I LOVE YOU. CONGRATS SIR!!!! MASSIVE RESPECT!!!
Ed is the boss. No big deal to him.
That Pepper looks like a tasty little blob of guacamole, just looks so innocent..... lol  XD
10:38
Did Ed eat a fake pepper?! How is he that calm?
So that facelif product really work? 😅
More with Chili Claus please 🔥🏆😂 * I am in heat!!!
That looks unpleasant af...
I am in heat 🔥🏆 World class line
Ed looks like he was chewing gum hahaha what a legend
Not the hottest pepper
Ed, "How is the flavour Klaus?!" Genius!
I love it when you and Clause meet up. It’s always a guaranteed good time.
I didn't realize I was holding my breath for the lsst two minutes until the plug came and I immediately gasped for air. What a visceral experience. Felt like I was there  This is great TV. A joy.
Bring Jena Ortega to test pepper X. She definitely gonna react react to this one, oh yeah.
No doubt his pepper is the hottest, but Guiness is not a record keeping company, its an event management and novelty company. No Guinness World record means anything and does not have to be verified by an "independent" source
add the Carolina Reaper to pepper x
Pepper X is man made it's not natural
The man is in heat.
I’ve had like tai food which can be relatively spicy but tbh I kinda wanna know ☠️
poor guy he looks like hes dying lol
Is it weird that my 8 year old doesn’t experience “spicy”.
You guys are insane. Respect. Love you guys. ✌️
Ed receiving the certificate and getting emotional.....I got something in my eye watching that ✌️
I dont think Mr.Klaus will be attending another tasting😂😂😂
Chili Klaus choking back tears saying “I think there’s some OAK in it😭” KILLED me
Love these brave boys!
If you are SMART, You "ACT" like you chew a few times, but you just swallow it.  ;)  The more ya know.
Imagine a show where celebrities drink more and more caffeinated drinks. And then it sparks a culture of people who try to make the most caffeinated drink.  Everyone is so dumb.
Chili Klaus looks like Ray Stevenson (RIP)
I don't know how but they broke the Chili Klause.
That’s a true lover of his product right there, so refreshing ❤
He bought my uncles gunshop to put PuckerButts there. Fort Mill,SC
conan o'brien tries pepper X
that actually looks like the devil's pepper
When Ed says "no one's been able to take us out" what he really means is that no one has the money to get that title, because to be named "world's best" anything you have to pay a crapload of money. There are plenty of peppers that are likely hotter than Ed's "hottest" peppers, but they're grown by small growers who don't have the cash.
But how's the flavor?
If you make a hotter one in the future call it pepper Y and the next pepper Z 😮
Never saw chilli Klaus that bombed away!!!😂😂😂
Ed is like guys chill, this is just the beginning
Shawn Evans need CM punk on the show
Fck that!
"I'm in... Heat. I'm in... Heat. Thank you very much." 🤣
"Did you invent that? Why?" 😂
Where can I buy some pepper X plants/ seeds ?
11:40 The fact that these plants developed these chemicals to stop animals from eating them...but humans went: "Yeah! I love that!😢
"Oak and pencil" Klaus need say no more. Then he does, " I'm in heat."
Bro thought he was at the Grammys for a sec 7:00
Pencil 💀  Good god, absolutely not. I cannot imagine that running its course through the GI tract. I ate a ghost pepper once and could feel it radiating in my body til it came out. With this being however much hotter than even a reaper, you got me fcked up. 😂
They keep saying the last dab has the same scoville as the pepper but it doesnt, Its diluted
This is not entertaining at all
"The pain, THE PAIN!" (c) Metal Gear Snake Eater Subsistence
Pure self torture lol
Did you do that? Did you invent that pepper?  Yeah. Why??  hahahahaha
PS- I’m convinced that Ed is the Dexter of hot peppers 😈
Bro if Chili Klaus barely survived that then I ain’t tempting fate 😂
Now all we need is someone  to invent  a liquid  drink antivenom  that will  extinguish  the burning  quick smart a d in a hurry ...
The pepper X last dab is not nearly as hot as they advertise. I pour this sauce over my chicken and it doesn't even remotely compare to eating a Carolina reaper.
Ed: No real throat burn like the reapers Me: Nice, that’s a relief Ed: It comes on later while you’re in pain Me:🫣
I am Convinced Ed doesn’t have capsaicin receptors like everyone Else in the world…
Bruh, that pepper just looks evil…
I don’t think anyone has earned their career more that Sean 😂
It seems appropriate that his voice sounds like Buffalo Bill from Silence of the Lambs
Loved the last exchange between Klaus and Ed Klaus: Did you invent that pepper? Ed: Yes Klaus: Why?
Ed Currie is the goat. And you know he has hotter
1:35 Okay, that thing looks straight up Evil. That thing looks like it was not grown on this world. It was never meant for humans to consume.
I'm In Heat😂😂😂😂❤❤❤
That's the first time I've ever seen Sean taken down!!!
Ed be like, "Oops, I only ate a yellow pepper. My bad."
😂😂😂😂 chili claus “I’m.. in..  I’m in heat.”
Finaly CHilli Klaus is getting ask back about the flavor in absolute pain.
Watching dudes talk about eating peppers as if they’re cannabis strains was not on my bingo card for today
Ed is an actual mad scientist and we love that for him.
roller skates and space shuttles are officially animals
"It's actually more like 3 times hotter." 💀
Ed and Noah completely unaffected by Pepper X. With Sean and Klaus going thru it. Unreal
Ed Currie as a guest on Hot Ones???
Sean totally got high at the end there.
The "Klaus Pepper" is a good name
This is our pepper 😂😂😂anybody can grow how dumb
Real human,,,, 🙏🏻✌🏼❤️🇺🇸
I heard that only few have tried it so far (in order to survive), maybe not a correct info. Mix it with drugs, secretary, distribute on the streets ,,, and no more druggies or the demand. :p
PAIN
Hope medical proffesions stands by!
It's strange that he hasn't had Johnny scoville on his show
Legend has it you immediately astroproject once that pepper lands on your tongue 😅😂😂
Dude looks like Randy Blythe's father 😂
The guy is in heat. I feel bad for his buddies lol
he needs to invent a tooth cleaning chilli
I just had a chip with three drops and I think that's probably the perfect dose for this delicious hot sauce.  It's amazing how good this pepper tastes despite being so hot.
When the other guys are paralyzed in pain Ed does some translation.
Ed I bought some of your pepper x table sauce from the hot sauce expo in Nashville and it was one of the best hot sauces I've ever had but it was really really hot too 😂
Why do we genetically engineer peppers thousands and thousands of times hotter than what can be found in nature? Because we can.
“Why” is a powerful single word question
I would love to try pepper x.  I love Carolina reapers I love spicy food. I eat spicy food every day as spicy as I can make it.
This is the dream team vid
Ed is an absolute animal. Barely touches him.
JFC, Ed's tolerance must be among the top in the world, from so much testing and culturing sustained over the years.  Given the effects of a 'regular' superhot - 1.5M to 2M, I can't imagine going further up the scale. You might as well just throw bear spray in your mouth.  Kudos to him.  I do remember hearing about Pepper-X a good 7 or 8 years ago, and I remember the disbelief and accusations.  Even then the rumors were about 2 - 2.2M.  Some thought the chocolate butlah would actually be hotter. Well - nope.  This one is going to hold the record for a while, I reckon.  I think I've had some Pepper-X sauce already, but not with tablespoon like usual, but a toothpick.  I'm tapping out. lolz
“I think there’s some oak in it… an….. “ 😢
Dabs: pause
"I feel the same as Klaus."  Hmm I think not 🤣
I guess at some point Ed just decided "im going to legally hurt people"
God bless you Ed
Corporations are predators
How do I get a hold of a pepper x
Ed be casually chewin' it like it's some bubblegum 😂
That thumbnail is funny: Klaus and Sean are in major pain and Ed is like "Oh, what a nice sunset!".
imagine how painful it's gonna be the next morning
He's such a fantastic interviewer.
Why no shipping to South Africa???
Poor Klaus. You should have just given him a piece of it, too.
Khang Starr invented a pepper and no one gets credit for that except him. I mean, he was even giving the seeds away to people all around the world and asking other people to just give the seeds away to everyone else. He doesn’t want anybody’s money or trademarks or copyrights. But he gets 100% credit. The fact that Ed doesn’t even release the pepper for other people to grow, selling it, or not, is pathetic. especially after 10 years or more. It takes time to stabilize, I get it. But come on. It’s like, no one cares about it anymore. If they can’t see it, eat it, grow it. Does it even exist! All the hot sauces made with it are a lie. They don’t contain the Scoville heat units that they claim they do. Not even close as a matter of fact. This guy’s lied about so many other things and we’re supposed to believe this. Who really cares anymore. Such a childish move on his part. Very selfish. This guys about money and nothing else. We all know you made a new pepper Ed. It’s not rocket science. You got your money and your 15 minutes of fame. Time to move on. This guys a disgrace to the pepper\chili community.
Invite @ChaseTheHeat next time for analysis😁
I love how Shawn waved the Guinness guy in.Haaaaaa limp wrist funny wave.
old style FWF - Much more original than the new 'rich and famous' versions
It’s not accepted by the pepper community. Simply because no one can buy them so it’s not real until it’s available. CHOCOLATE PRIMOTALI REMAINS SUPREME!!!!!!🔥🔥🔥
“Oh no… Klaus is breeding ! 😮”
I genuinely developed heartburn watching this
I need Rhett and Link to try this! 😂😂😂
Can you get the pepper x seeds to buy? If so where?
It looks like a pepper stuffed with wasabi
His pepper x made him cry of proudness 😂❤️
Chili Klaus's patented hiccup is always fun
JP Pirhana is the world's hottest now
These people are masochists
Rollerskates, Spaceships, animals?!
"I'm in heat" 😂😂😂😂
you can just feel and hear how nervouse they got when the peppers came out
"I love seeing the fear on peoples faces when they eat my sauce"  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Ed is a badass
I honestly think I would die if I ate pepper X. I suffer when I eat a habanero.
“I’m in heat!” 😂 I’m gonna start saying that for now on lol
Ed Currie is the Nick Saban of creating hot peppers.
Dude, that looks like a mushroom you aren't supposed to touch.
Iets wat zo heet is kan geen smaak meer hebben🤷‍♂️.
Seeing Ed talk about peppers is beautiful
Scoville aren't logarithmic though, so it's not three times as hot as a reaper (even if it was logarithmic, the difference wouldn't be x3 at a difference of 1000000 units...). It's linear.
Love these Guys!  Congrats with the new record Ed!!! :)
Chili Klaus is a chili legend!
Klaus is messed up in the head
✏️
One of the funniest things I've seen in years! Love Klaus!
I don’t get it. Why would someone want to experience this?😂
Seeing Ed all emotional when he got the plaque was amazing
Change the name of the pepper to “I AM HEAT”
I so want a pepper x seed, it would be a great addition to my garden.
God that pepper looks diabolical
You do not want to hide the heat, flavour and the euphoria
This is the best lol so wholesome
Ed & Klaus really are such a dream pairing
Pepper X, it's the spice mixed with Chemical X  Get some Sugar and "Everything Nice" and you can start creating the Powerpuff Girls!
Can’t imagine the pain when it leaves your body 😅💀
He used violent to describe what was happening in his mouth. I don’t think I’ll be trying that pepper 😅
Can they make a pepper so hot you will just die?
Chili Klaus is becoming more and more like Santa is he lived at the South Pole.
Heat haha😂
BRO STOP RUBBING HIS BACK!!!
Bro is tweaking. What corporations are sending other people to steal peppers? Conspiracy lunatic detected.
Can someone please buy Ed a New, Nice Shirt!! 💪🥵💪🥵
Not to be a party pooper, but I doubt Pepper X is going to "take over the world"
That man owns that pepper by more than anything with the way he can eat it and have zero reaction lol
Bruh Ed is a gangster!💯🤣
He must be just trained, years of eating hot chilies
Chili Klaus was in HEAT!
Just got a bottle of Xperience, for those scared to try don't worry... It only hurts A LOT
"There is no throat burn." "Oh, good." "That comes on later, when you're in pain." Best sly comment ever made on this show.
As a Dane who has followed Klaus for years since he started doing chili challenges in Denmark and having followed hot ones as well. This was amazing to watch.  To see that you actually brought Chili Klaus to saying "I'm done" and "I'm in heat"... Well freaking played guys!
So awesome to see Ed Currie get his props! I’ve been a fan since day one and this is STILL some of the best interview content on Youtube. I would love to see Sean go a little deeper i to the culinary world of peppers and spice. Maybe help tell the story of John Young and the Bellissimos (the inventors of the hot wing). That would be awesome!!
Why would you do this to your self good lord
What I appreciate about Ed is he is first and foremost a top tier botanist and farmer. Extremely intelligent. He’s got a great personality and is a very kind and humble person. He’s broken two world records and highlights his team.
It's about time.
Ed is well on his way to becoming a real life culinary Bond villan. Waiting for the SPECTRE pepper.  Him and his team earned it, take over the world Ed.
"Ahhhhhhh" thee biggest reaction I've seen outta Mr Currie 😂
Chilli Claus is awesome... Pure sweet and awesome guy
whats with the green cast on the tight shot camera
Wow, y'all made this the most exciting pepper experience. Congratulations Smokin' Ed!!
Ed currie started sounding like Cleveland brown for a few seconds at 12:15 lol
I'd love to see a sauce-off with YouTube's Tech Ingredients perhaps combine it with an experiment with an interview too
My husband is absolutely giddy seeing Chili Klaus again. He is a total OG.
Smokin' Ed is a PoS
Now this is a great group of fellas.
The Scoville scale is not logarithmic, it's linear.
PepperX is the new bottox
QUEEFIE Love Sean Evans! Great, underrated host. Boom.
There’s corporate espionage in the world of peppers?!
The bald guys eyebrows turned green and yellow like the Pepper X 😂🤣
Elon Musk should taste Pepper ❌ 😈
I'm in heat, hahahahaha 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hey did u eat such a small one Sean?
How are Sean’s insides not pure goo at this point? It is incredible how he is able to keep doing stuff like this😳
the fact that the spicyness that peppers have is meant to ward off predators by causing pain and humans just being like "OW oh wait hold on it hurt but it good" and then forcibly trying to make them EVEN HOTTER because we cant get enough is really funny to me in an attempt to stop getting eaten the pepper ensured that it got eaten but also forever ensured it would never die because we would keep growing them
When do you know if u have gone too far. How much can a human take  😅
Ed Currie back there all chill and taking it like a champ...he be like the teacher trying to get his students to understand a math problem while their minds are a million miles away.
😂😂😂😂🎉👍👍
I AM KLAUS!!!
You need the real deal League of champions spice Queen👑 🇬🇧 on your show
3:58   And then they get really scared. I like the way that people look when they they get really scared from eating my hot sauce. You know? It’s just a lot of fun. -Jeffrey Dahmer
The fact that it made chilli klaus suffer tells you everything
I love watching grown men hurt themselves for our enjoyment
It's immoral to patent life
Love smokin ed - i love his passion and dedication
Ed is a serious Badass!!!
Just had some of the end flatline.. pretty hot stuff. How does that compare to pepper x?
Ed is a beast
The danish guy looked like he was regretting everything about his life when they brought out the pepper.
The fun of peppers is being able to grow your own makes pepper x pointless
That pepper just looks like it would destroy your insides
If Chris is acting like that!.....it's gotta be hot!  My 3 bottle just came!
Lies, all lies. The sauce is only about 61 000 scoville. How is that possible when it's made from %91 of a 2, 6 million scoville pepper?
It's not hot until Chili starts snapping next to his ears. That's when it goes Gonzo.
I already know I could take this pepper on and not make a face 🙂
Imagine if this guy do marijuhana,, how high can it go
If you were to eat it, handling it without gloves would be dangerous. And also, if you eat a whole Pepper X, it can be fatal.
Sean is so nice to Ed and the team.
Ed is fun to watch. He seems like a genuinely kind person who happens to also be a pepper genius, haha!
I love Chile Klaus his reactions are legendary and he absolutely loves the pain and is such a great sport.
9:31 Edit: 10:21 THIS IS WHERE IS STARTS! - Get ready for the end of humanity! "I'm not going to hurt you" he says, while everyone holds a PEPPER-X. - The giggles kick in like it's THC. Edit: LOL "I am in Heat" 12:26
Ed giving props to the team before himself is the testament of a true leader.
Pepper x infused alcohol
I love these guys man, ed proud of you! You deserve a spot in Guinness and chili klaus is such a lovable badass. lol Great episode! Need to re-up on my heatonist hot sauces, best hot sauces ever!
That moment when Chili Klaus starts rubbing his forehead 😂 before even trying the pepper 🌶️ lol he was already regretting it 😂
It's mad that the hottest pepper is 2.6 million SHU but you can get pure capsaicin extract that measures 16 million SHU. Look at what 2.6m SHU does to Klaus then imagine SIXTEEN MILLION.
Watching ed just describe the burning with little to no reaction is crazy this man is a supervillain
You can tell that pepper X is really HOT when Klaus says first that he's done.
Joel Hansen somewhere having traumatizing flashbacks
Sadly this chili tasting felt rushed. The first Sean's Chili Klaus encounter with Carolina Reaper was more pleasing. But  "I'm in heat"  partly saved it. 😂
Casually bringing klaus out just to attempt killing him with peppers is a hot ones classic
My God, I love super spicy but don't think I'd survive this,,,PepperX 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Watching the first 20 seconds of this makes you realize this is truly a legendary episode.
Can you buy Pepper X yet?
Yeah . . . NO!  No way - surviving the intake is one thing . . . it's the other end of the process that would just disembowel me.  No thanks!
Is Chili claus ok after this?
7:00 min too8 min 😂😂gimme a break😂😂
Why are his teeth so disgusting 😢😢😅😅
A friend of mine do an hybrid of Caroline Reaper and pepper x....he still in critical condition....
May the 4th be with the team behind Pepper X and everyone else who sees this!!!!! 🌟 💫 🌶️  🫑
Only people with strong natural acid in stomach can handle.
Adamlar yapmış ağğbiiiiii
Vanilla ice-cream work
Why
“I think there’s some oak in it… and pencil….” 😂 I love Chili Klaus
Hope they don't try to take dude out to get his peppers
Less talking and more doing.
It's weird seeing the shop behind my house on this show but I couldn't be happier for smokin Ed and he makes my community proud
I have to try it. I like spicy
There is no way I would eat that no way!!!
Everybody collectively dying   Ed: ya the throat burn comes later when you’re in pain   😂😂😂😂😂😂 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Klaus - Did you really invent that pepper?  ED - YES.  Klaus - Why?  Gets me everytime 😂
10:09 at that moment Klaus is rethinking his profession choice lol
Snapping takes away the pain.
Klaus is breeding lol 😂
Do you think Klaus was heading to the bathroom? He took the whole pepper like a boss. Love Klaus!
Ed eaten so many peppers his pupils are permenantly dialated.
There's sum danged oak in it 😂😂😂😂
Honestly seeing this man tear up and start shaking after getting the recognition for his 20 years of hard work by him and his team is one of the best things I’ve seen in a very long time. Can’t wait to try this sauce this weekend
This is like Spicy All Stars. Amazing.
I didnt know Prince Harry like peppers
"did you do that did you invent that pepper" Ed: "yea" Klause: "why?" XD
I loooove tis show man. Watching this one was funny as heck man
I wish I would've been lucky enough to work for Ed before his notoriety.
Sean and Clause dying while the other 2 js chilling XD
Why??🥵
Where can I find pepper x?
First time I’ve seen fear in Klaus eyes.
I literally broke out in sweat watching this
Ed is not a normal human being.
A good name for the world's hottest pepper would be hells 🔥 fire
I dont know how he handles that so well
Ed is the best!
I hate watching Klaus suffer It's like watching Santa suffer...Santa...Claus...Klaus... OH MY GOD!!!
Klaus is the best... legend of the show
Choked up and goose bumps. You are a good person for sharing that credit with your team. As per usual, Hot Ones/First We Feast is always a class act! ROFLMAO I love the flavor, think there is some oak in it!
10:38 you’re welcome
Klaus is sooo Goood :)
As an HPLC analyst, I'm tempted to sneak some of the sauce on the instrument when on the clock
"did you invent that pebber ?" "Ye" "Hhwhy ?"
The host is a pepper fanboy. Grow up
It would be cool to see Johnny Scoville and chilli Klause in the same room testing out peppers and sauces
Congrats. Nearly 2,7 mio. scoville for a chili pepper is crazy.
Poor Klaus, having to concentrate on speaking a foreign language in this moment.
I AM KLAUSE!
Klaus: I'm in heat 🥺😭  OH NO HES BREEDING!
Ed! I love you ❤️ brother and thank you 🙏 for all your hard work.
PLEASE STOP CALLING CHILIES "PEPPERS."
Ed Currie has a desi Gut for sure
.  WHY ? .
Chili Klaus looked really uncomfortable, I felt bad for the guy. Tough watch.
Whats Prince Harry doing there?
i will say, the inventor did not eat one of them cause he had ZERO reaction to it.
The Heat Is On (Glenn Frey song)🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵
“I’m in heat!” is unfortunately going to wash out what is, to me, the best part of this vid.  Ed Currie getting choked up by receiving Guinness recognition.
Outta my pepper league 😭🔥
"I'm out!" 🤣🤣🤣
I haven't even watched the video yet and I can see that's one evil pepper 😂
Do not know if I am right but the pain makes the body release endorfins against the pain so you can get a little high and blurry vision
No natural hot sauce can compete heat wise with some of the crazy extract sauces that are out there!!
11:04 😂😂😂 poor Claus
We do you get those wonder toys? I cant wait to try one 🔥🥵
What's wrong with Ed? He is a human or alien?
It is weird that I started sweating watching them eat those peppers?
officially from guiness means nothing though...
Give it to your average Joe and watch their reaction
all the legends brought together! epic!
7:15 Yeah I did that, me, I was the one who made him break down, and I bask in this moment, deliciously.
the inventor should be forced to eat one of those peppers whole every single day until a hotter one is developed
I dont understand the point of showing so much in the intro… just me?
Gotta respect Ed, seems like the most genuinely nicest guy. He probably puts pepper spray on his cornflakes so I wouldn't want to hang out with him but still.
Endorphins are great.
“Oh no, Klaus is breeding” 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Sean/Chili Klaus: writhing with pain  Ed: you won’t feel it in the throat  Me a concerned mother: Thank God  Ed: That comes later with the pain  Everybody: What?!
11:10 11:31 11:39
Uncle needs to come to NorthEast India
I’m sweating 😓 watching this video 😮😮😮
Wanna try it 🤤🔥🤌
I love to watch people eat incredibly spicy foods.  And then I do it myself. 😁👍
Oh no dont hurt Animals
Owner is totally fine
Edd straight up is Insane
Put that pepper back in the vault 😂😂
I'm afraid to rub my eyes after clicking on this video
skip to 10:38
12:26 we know that tear is coming from joy and not coz it's hot.😂
why people do this..
OMFG! The inventor of pepper-x, does not seem to react at all the same as his guest. Is he so good at transcending the pain. Is smoking Ed Currie real?
Imagine inventing a new hot pepper and it looks likes thr hobgoblins left nut. "Its done"
why doesn't Sean Evans eat the whole pepper?!
Claus , "did you invent that pepper ... why ?😢"     😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The eating of Pepper X just coincided with the mating ritual of the average Danish man 😅
Until Johnny scoville says it’s the hottest I won’t believe it. There’s a reason ed hasn’t let Johnny have one…because a farce
This pepper is a gimmick
Crazy
That was hilarious! 😂😂
C'est un mauvaise mort amis partout
Chili Klaus ate the pepper and got cerebral palsy...
Ed ate melted candle wax, prior like Homer 😂
WOW👍👍👍👍🇺🇸
Ed is like a zen monk. He’s probably having explosive diarrhea as his insides liquify and there’s no hint of any of it on his face. What a champ!
How is anyone falling for this? They are not in pain at all
Jalapeños are hot to me. I tried a tiny piece of Habanero once and it almost took me out. 2.6 million scovilles?! There is no flavor at that point 😂
Oak and pencil ha ha
New torture device  😅
He gives me Jeff Dunham bubba J vibes 😂😂
I swear to christ, Ed could narrate his own death on The Rack in a calm voice.
Apparently they haven't read the studies that show high concentrations of capsaicin can have mutagenic effects.
yeah, I bet car battery acid has intense flavor too guys
Pencil 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Pepper X is a terrible name, Elon Musk probably likes it, which automatically makes it terrible.  It sounds like a brand of mace for women who just got out of an abusive relationship.
Lol these guys sounds like they talkin bout smokin tweeds
Great video!
When math strikes the fear of God in you, "But that scale is logarithmic."
YT content creators like these are many time more interesting and respectful to me than the Hollywood culture of emptiness and shallowness.
Awesome episode fellas!
is the pepper guy wearing a life jacket under his shirt?
Can I still drive right after eating that ?! 😅
Eating this should be illegal
I love how Ed cries when given the plaque, but does not care after eating the pepper.
as a chili head, THIS HAS NO APPEAL TO ME!
Ed doesn't even flinching at all 😅
Ed is just one of those men who loves to watch the world burn
That dude has 3×Ds! That's disgusting
Why do these extremely hot  peppers always look so demonic.
As bad as it is when you eat it, it's ten times worse when you excrete it....
Tight tight tight tight YEAAAH
Nope
Crazy
@10:39 they finally taste the peppers
My scalp and nose started sweating just by watching their reaction.
Man! I’m literally sweating watching them eat it!! 🥵                       🔥
This guy is unreal Ed is on another level
this is the definition of the opposite of food, the one thing that your body REFUSES in every way. flawless victory.
Man its so rare and fun so see sean in pain
Snap it out klaus
This isn't really complete until it comes out the other end, thats the real test. 😄
Ed's amused look as Sean and Klaus are in visible pain; as if he's thinking, "Fellas, it hasn't even started kicking in yet."  😁
Make a sauce out of the pepper X
Ed looks like he smells of chilli
I love Bhoot Jolokia ❤
I doubt ive ever laughed that hard at a YouTube video.  Hahaha.
Did you invent that pepper? Yeah! ..why? 😂😂😂😂
What’s crazy he’s has one that’s hotter
Klaus is hilarious 😂
smokin' ed is like a final boss fight in a game that the developers intended to be nearly impossible just to see just how far the people are willing to go to try and beat him
What is the point of eating one. Dangerous to health for many.
Peppers are to enhance foods and other flavors.  Not to burn your mouth, lips, sinus, or butter. I enjoy heat, but if not used correctly, it can totally ruin your food and enjoyment.  Love the show and if not for exchange, duty and delivery I would be buying from Hot Wings.
danish people are always in heat btw
Ed used to be an alcoholic and used hot peppers to quit. It’s an amazing story.
Klaus er helt ude og skide
Prince harry
😂😂him breaking down saying he thinks it’s oak & pencil is so funny. 💀
would you plzzz bring garyvee to try this one? 😂
Did you? Did you invent that pepper? Why? 😂 😂😂🔥🔥🔥Great Episode!! Thank you
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😍😍😍😍😍😍😝😝😝😝🤪🤪🤪🤪
Ed could get pepper sprayed and he might start describing the flavor 😂
I'm fucken cracking up over here😂😂😂 fucken Clause 😂😂😂😂
Wish someone would create a pepper that hits REALLY hard but dies away quickly.  Now that would be moreish.
wonderful & beautiful….and a testament to together we are stronger, literally 💪😉👍 well done, deserved & delightful ❤
green pepper but red sauce 91%?!
Chili went off camera and quietly passed away
At the end, Sean Evans sounds like Bobcat Goldthwait and the Pepper X guy sounds like Marvin the Martian....
If I acquire a pepper x, I am going to dice it into 10² pieces to make it last a long time and eat it one piece at a time thawed from the freezer.
Ed currie talking about how watered down his sauce is because he knows it tests at 61k for his last dab sauce. Dont but it thinking its a superhot sauce. Its not hot
I bet that felt good coming out the other end
Pure heated passion 🙂 A little input about Chilie Klaus. We have NO tradition for spicy food in Denmark, it is not like he has been used to strong chili form he was little - love what he does :-)
It was satisfying watching the girl behind you going through a sea of emotions, from disgusted to impressed
I just love everythikg with chili klaus 😂
A spoonful of peanut butter will take the burn away in 2 minutes!
Ed Currie and Puckerbutt are a fraud!
12:27 Klaus: "I'm... in... heat..." 😂😂😂😂 God he is so unintentionally funny
and that was the last time we'll ever see klaus lol
Sean handled that much better than reaper
I had to go to the can just watching this
Hot
Moment of death ☠️☠️💀☣️☣️ 10:36 >>> 1:30
😂
I've got his personal gardens Carolina repor peppers.
I guess the successor to Pepper X deserves the moniker Pepper Y  Or perhaps Pepper Why?  😂
I’m in heat 😂
If Ed's toilet could talk it'd claim domestic abuse
You should have one of the legends on the show johhny scoville
chilli klaus is such a legend  im in... HEAT  did u invent that pepper?  >yes why?
All gentlemen and scholars, I respect you all... little sad to not see Jonny Scoville as a part of the og crew.
I like this video.🥵💪
"Why?"   This is the correct question.
I want to experience this pepper 😊
If Sean is practically knocked out, it must be hot.  He breezes through those Hot Ones challenges.
You should invite Ed Currie and have him supply beginning from stupiT to  instant death variety of his personal stock of sauces.  Bet you will have a fun time.
this chealleangs is for a live kids dont du it at home
"Did you invent that pepper?"  -  "Yeah"  - "Why!?" 😆
At this rate they'll be growing peppers with capsaicin trichomes coating it like some nice sticky buds
Fan"Fin"tastic! Ed stands there watchin' them & talking like he's only got gum in his mouth! 😆🤣😆🤣🤣🤣
Sadistic Taylor Swift!
If Ed Currie ever played a villain he would be that guy who kills his victims with snake venom and while they slowly die he would just be calmly educating them on what the venom does to their tissues, organs and nervous system.
Did you invent that pepper? yes. Why? :D
I loved this guy, so much. I hope you will success even more. and god bless him.
That was hilarious!
Weaponized food... Seems legit!
And people wonder why he isn't making pods and seeds available. I mean, it would be irresponsible to do so.
"I like seeing people get really scared when eating my hotsauce" cracked me up
I guess Coolio wasn't available for this one.
Invite L.A Beast and make him eat a whole jar of those things.
God bless Ed in Jesus name 🙏 he is such a a cool guy
I love me some Chili Klaus!!
Ed Currie is brilliant but the scoville scale isn't logarithmic.
Ed is just being normal bro😂
I'm just disappointed that Sean didn't eat a whole pepper.
I love watching non chili eating people try vicious chili 😂 Ed is a champ.
Oh my goodness that looks miserable
Does anyone know why Sean didn't eat the whole pepper??
"Did you invent that pepper?"  "Yeah"  "Why?"  🤣
Why do people even bother with guinness anymore? It's common knowledge that they are essentially just purchasable marketing.
did you invent that reaper? yeah... why??? 🤣
The Apollo sauce is really good
Ed poppin them like strawberries
Guiness is a joke
Whatever happened to  the Chocolate Bhutla? I thought that thing was screaming near 3 Million SHU. Have they discontinued trying to stabilise it?
I love how Pepper X almost looks like an alien fruit from a movie that you know the main characters are going to eat even though the audience is screaming don't.
They’ll only stop when somebody dies 😂💀
Wow.... That "Ed"" guy that engineered this pepper is about as weird and creepy as it comes😳😳
Pain is NOT a flavor!!
I love that he continuously said “ we”. Very modest.
Mans shed a tear over making a hot pepper. He luvs that ish
Ed eats it like it's a piece of candy.. that men is something else.
as entertaining as this is ill never understand why people do this to themselves or enjoy it
I bought a jar of pepper x sauce with the intent of putting a video on youtube. i marinaded chicken tenders. needless to say the upload got cancelled. i was told by my wife (she laughs uncontrollably) that i hung my head in the kitchen sink and was speakng in previously unknown languages. Also, i had a combination of snot and slobber on my shirt. Other than that it was a tasty hot sauce
i'm in... i'm in... I'M IN HEEET!
"From roller skates to the space-shuttle, there two totally different animals."  *Runs, grabs biology book, flips thru pages and finds roller skates and the space shuttle.* "Yep, it checks. They are two totally different animals."
Somebody give these men a medal.😂😂 i love hot stuff but even the reaper is alot for me id never eat a whole one.
Notice they had to eat the entire pepper for heat and not the sauce? Because it's not hot! They should issue an apology to everyone who bought this
guy in the middle seems put together and successful in his own little arena, so get your teeth fixed they're awful
Ed or Johnny scolville? I take ed for the win
make this guy the owner and ceo of the FDA
After finding out the SHU's of Ed's xperience pepper x sauce 61K SHU it's questionable to the level of truth behind pepper x.   Not trying to get blocked for this comment but it's pretty serious if your promoting 91% pepper x sauce and it's been documented by Ed himself that it was tested over 2 mil SHU's and it's really only 61k shu's.   I feel this is worthy of an explanation to the pepper community! The ball is in your court just be honest!
He really likes to see people panic....lol. Sick and twisted
Liars
I love ED CURRIE🤩🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥴🥴🥵🥵🥴🤩🤩🤩THE GODFATHER OF HEAT. Where can i buy it in Holland( Netherland ) please WHERE?????????????????? Greetings from holland, Amsterdam✌🖐
Ed exposed as the creator officially is all that matters.
He's in heat? OK I'm not trying one of these.
That thing looks evil...
I just watched all episodes of SuperHots on Hulu where the Primo was tested as beating the Carolina reaper as the hottest pepper in the world at something like 1,600,000 Scoville where the Carolina reaper is at around 1,500,000. The show seems to have come out fairly recently so I don't think it is a coincidence at all that he unveils pepper x to the world for consumption around this time. He will not be dethroned! All I have to say is I reapply hope Shahinna does not eat these. She has suffered enough for her undefeated pepper eating contests. Meanwhile, I shall stick to my seranos and jalapeños. 😅
So awesome of First We Feast to ensure this guy got the credit for his own pepper! Sounds silly but imagine if someone else did get ahold of it a decade ago and we never even heard of him
Pepper X is a sham! The Last Dab sauce was tested to only be 61kSHU.   BUNCH OF LYING CLOWNS! 🤡
Is it a right of passage to be able to handle heat when wanting to  work for ed lol
This whole show is theatrical like the pepper X
91% but only 61k SCH?
His bouquet of peppers 😂 love this guy
What flavour ? hahhahahha best one i ever heard
mentaly ill...ok..get some help
So the guy that broke the record and did all the work is sitting in the backround??
To say one gets high off eating hot peppers...KNUCKIN FUTZ!!!
The last dab was sent to a lab. Results were 61k SHU. If the pepper is green why is the sauce red when it is 91% mash?
Ed does not have worms that's for sure. ;)
61,019 SHU. A total scam (as expected from these fools).
Why is this sauce not as hot a thai pepper? false advertisement. Is pepper x fake then. I just want a legit sauce with pepper x.
He has been challenged pepper D just saying and really 60,019 shu in a 91% red sauce from the mustard (green pepper) 🤡 show lol
Complete frauds, Sauce has been lab tested at 61k. Go grab a habinaro sauce it's going to be hotter
Complete fraud. Will FWF address the testing completed on the X hot sauce only hitting 61k SHU? Of course not… it’s smoke and mirrors for the uneducated masses.
oage fuachn oida, brenns da eine, du voifloschn
Finally.. I've had the gin honey infusion for some time, and it has seemingly become hotter over time. It is about 1 year and 8 months old now
That made my day thx
”I’m in heat” 😂
My happy zone doesnt go much higher than Thai Birdeye (80k). For me, anything hotter is just misery without the matching joy.
I think Ed is Lawful Evil.
I absolutely love these hot peppers & sauces but I have to cycle up & down so I don't destroy myself. The ride from a jalapeno up to a reaper again is always a fun ride.  As always, use the RIGHT amount (of spice), not the white amount! - Uncle Roger
I don't even want to imagine how taking a dump after that feels...
this channel is obviously using sub and viewer bots...
Chocolate scorpion x ?
what the heck happened to the Apollo pepper? I thought that was supposed to be hotter than Pepper X
They almost killed that man 😂
Thats an insane heat level for peppa x, sounds like its around double the level of a reaper! How much further can you go heat wise before its hazardous to eat it?
Have Ed eat a chocolate primotelli
old mates on the right are like..........walking it out no problem......thats called addiction
you see now i DONT GET TOOLS or SPORTS MUCH but manly chilli bonding......i get that
CHILLIIIIIII KLAUUUUUUUUUSSSS!!!!
Ed biggest Fraud in the game. Stole the Reaper, x and y.
Why?
Man, Ed Currie is a beast with heat lol
So eating spicy peppers is like a drug to these guys😂
Ed scares me ngl
lol the boss guy stared at claus to make sure he wasn’t gonna die at first
Are we sure Ed isn't a serial killer?
_Did you invent pepper?_ _Yeah._ _..why?_ LOL i burst into tears laughing, Klaus is a precious person.
you know its a real episode when chili klaus shows up
I know a lot of folks love to joke about how ridiculous the heat of peppers like Pepper X or Carolina Reapers is, and it is absurd to be breeding peppers this hot.  However, knowing Ed takes it so seriously, and that he respects the people he works with and how hard they've all been working to create this pepper, I'm so happy for him. Seems like a real stand up guy, and incredibly humble.
Pepper plants: "I'm gonna make myself spicy so animals leave me alone" Humans:
Ed the kinda guy to eat a bag of the one chip challenge for a snack 😂
Congratulations Pepper X team🌶️✨🥲
Chili!! ❤
I love the way Ed talks, like the way he says “pepper” is almost like “paper”. He’s just such a pure soul
Man, my guts just roll thinking about how my body would react to eating something like this.
I  can only imagine the pain of a whole pepper coming out the other end. 🚽
People who don't actually eat Chiles have no idea about the hottest pepper quit being sheep folks and going off of what you're fed and get some real life experience!..........
It's not hard to barely break a sweat when it's not the real deal .
I literally laughed until I cried!!
I can’t imagine to myself 😮
Legit nothing can be said about Sean ever.  Won't be stared down by anyone or any pepper.
A restraunt I worked at we did a hot ones challenge. It wasn't on the menu and you had to be in the know, but the owner made sure we had them on hand. Can't remember the exact lineup we had but they were put away put of order so I had to basically run the Gauntlet and make my best determination as to the order. This lineup had Da Bomb and Apollo at #9 and #10 respectively. Da Bomb truly has no redeemable qualities, it is battery acid. The Apollo sauce is genuinely one of the best hot sauces I've ever had. Spicy and very flavourful
12:27 He's in heat.
It acutally will make you feel high
Fun fact you can actullay die from it
By Eds reaction, you'd almost think he got a fake pepper.
Chili Klaus is crazy
What is the risk of people dying after eating one of these peppers? Surely that amount of insane stress on the body runs the risk of heart attacks or strokes?
This looks miserable.
Pshhhh everybody knows what the three major capsinoids are
I want to know who hurt Ed? It seems like he’s taking hot,delicious revenge on the world!!! lol congrats Ed
I cried when he cried.
That Extreme Chili Pepper: Pepper X, I'm Going to have Diarrhea from Pooping
Man bro f that
I watched Oppenheimer last night, and this feels like another cautionary tale about the dangers of man's scientific curiosity lol
Smokin' Ed - What a lovely person. So happy for the team that reached that achievement!
I don't like these designer peppers... the greed, the copyright, the lawyers... it kills the spirit, in my opinion. I'm all for humans breeding new peppers, but the selfishness, the desperation for credit, for cash, for fame, it just makes me sick.
I have never seen Chili Klause look like that.
Chili Klaus - "did you invent this pepper?" Ed Currie - "yes!" Chili Klaus - "but why?"
Love it, everybody is on their last leg, their body is braking down, collapsing, they are in an excruciating pain, Ed - "I got a bit of tear in my eye" so calm, so measured, no dramas at all ... LOVE IT !!!
tbf those reaction looked underwhelming, so im skeptical  need a regular joe schmoe for comparison
7:00, 10:17,  12:30
Im in heat!
I wonder how much stomach lining they have left.... 😂
I feel like they are exploiting Smokin' Ed. How can they stand up there with that guy and not be wrecked with guilt for not taking him to a dentist?
Dramatic..
getting closer and closer to actually making a Guatemalan Insanity Pepper   heck, that thing actually looks nuclear 😂
Gotta say, the Xperience sauce is amazing. I've had other super hot sauces before, and usually the flavor is lost beneath the spice - not here, it's got a rich earthy flavor to it. Congrats on another record!
That first part when he got the award was so wholesome 🥹
Ed Currie reminds me of an Observer from Fringe, no reaction to the heat!
3 legends
The heat doesn't bother me too much, it's the stomach ache after that is brutal.
IP ownership of a pepper is lame.
The last dab xperience is bulls—t it is less hot than habanero when I use a large dab of it
I cannot even imagine how it must feel like. Insanity :D
"I'm in heat"
“It’s very spicy.”
I can’t imagine how their stomach feels about 20 minutes later.
Ed: "I'm starting to get a little tear..."  Everyone else: *gasping for breath*
The passion to suffer together!😅
I wonder how Johnny Scoville  would do with this pepper.
Wasnt that Guinness World Records guy in that Squid games challenge series on netflix o.O
I swear Ed must have had some gnarly flu at some point and lost his sense of taste. He looks like the pepper fkn terminator.
Ed is going to be the only non combatant to ever face war crimes
Yesterday I ate a Carolina Reaper, a Scorpion and a Ghost Pepper all at once. It was crazy hot. Lol
Smokin' Ed was just chillin'!! lol. Congratulations to him and his team on this incredible accomplishment!
First time seeing Sean break character and suffering 😂
Congratulations to Smokin Ed Currie, and his team, for this achievement. I like spicey hot, but I could not handle anything near this heat. I like a locally made independent brand of hot sauce (shout out to "Hot Heads" hot sauce). It is very tasty and has just the right amount of heat for me, but Ed and Sean would probably consider it like maple syrup on pancakes. Hats off to you guys!
I ate a sliver of ghost pepper and I thought I needed to call the EMT'S
Oh no, Klaus is Breeding
Almost as bad as the heat a fellow participant Ed cool as a cucumber Oh no Klaus is in heat smiling,Devastating!
Chili Klaus is a legend!! Been there since the start ❤️🇩🇰
I'm pretty much out on the show by now but i'll always come back for some Chili Klaus and Ed Currie content.
I'm in heat is going on all my profiles effective immediately.🔥🔥🔥
Far out Ed's tolerance is inhuman. Unsurprising given his line of work but still... He didn't even flinch aside from a tear and was able to fully articulate the experience. Incredible.
Cheers to you Smokin Ed!
I can’t even eat a habanero
That Y chromosome, man. LOL.
How. Just How? I cant handle a finger chilli, at all!!
Quite simply the best and most wholesome episode over
How do you test the scoville?
I would like to have one or two
Spice King needs to do this
Sorry, not to forget.... Happy new year😊
Dear sean, why you call it pepper when its chili? Sorry im infected by beeing danish. I understand the most. But not all.
I think there is some oak in it ahhhh LOL
8:20  🔥🥵
Whyyyyyyy?!?!?
I bought hot ones sauce at puckerbutts last week!
MAPA MAGA
I felt the hair stand up on the back on my neck when Chili Klaus tossed that pod into his mouth.
When will it be possible to buy seeds Pepper X?
Fort Mill is my hometown. I'm 4th or 5th generation Fort Millian!!! ❤❤❤ looove how Puckerbutt, REALLY put Fort Mill on tha map!!! ❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
Why Why Why Why Why Why Why Why Why Why Why Why Why Why Why Why
Nope. 🥵🥵🥵🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️
I'm convinced Ed Currie is some kind of robot because nobody can casually eat that pepper and not burst into flames
Pass
Zero reason for Noah to be there and just awkward the whole time
I made a salsa with 2 reapers from a friend, but he said they weren’t that hot this year. Still pretty warm. I’ve gotta get some of this sauce!
Thats how the Xbox was named
Congrats!!!!
“I’m in heat” - Famous last words
LOL!! Im in heat.
Unaccustomed people could DIE doing this thing.
Ed has some serious manmeries
I got a hold of a bottle of hotsauce with Carolina Reaper, ghost pepper and habanero. That thing was insane! Tasted great, but was so insanely hot.
No thanks. Nothing about this seems like fun.
great strain starts with sativas   ALWAYS
Can you imagine growing the genetic ability to defend yourself against predators and then seeing that defense get advanced to astronomical proportions just for the predator to point it at themselves willingly for their own enjoyment? People are wild
Everything right in the world!! Sean gentleness towards Ed - classy Return of Chili!!
I love how he’s just chilling there describing the burn but completely unfazed. How do you do it? I like spice, but I’d be squirming if I tried that  The other thought I kept having was “Don’t touch your eyes!”
I liked how Klaus asked Ed.Why he invented “Pepper X”!
Why ? just Why 😂😂😂
Um I can't even handle blue heat takis so I'm good on that offer😅
Woof must be hot for Chili Klaus to react like that haha Ed Currie is a boss
We need a movie about Ed and the team's journey. Cast Paul Giamatti as Ed perhaps?
Good job and I never eat it.
validated? By Guinness. Whaaaaaa? Is this serious? Is Guinness now a scoville measurement company?
"I love the flavor!" - Yep. Sure. 😂
The best 😅
Charlie would die here xD. @penguinz0
Guinness, the universal experts of hot peppers. No question about Ed's team's efforts and their achievement, but Guinness kinda flattens the meaning of the achievement knowing how out of touch they are with many records they archive and the amount of nonsense records. The achievemenet is much more impressive without them.  I'm curious why they report the heat at millions with so many numbers when I understand they can vary a lot per pepper.
I think you should try and see if the guy that has the you tube channel everything spicy would like to come on your show.
For anyone out there that has never ate some of these. I ate a ghost pepper once but by far hottest thing i ever ate was habenero extract. Pure excruciating heat. These guys crazy😅
Congrats guys, very nice to talk about the whole team
Love Ed's love for what he does.
Ed is the man!
How can I get any Carolina reaper or pepper X in my country, Jordan 🇯🇴?
if monsanto can patent their GMO garbage, ed should be able to protect his plants too.
He got teared up over the teamwork and winning yet once again. Dude cried more from his heart than from the pepper. Thats awesome man. I love hot food and people's passion for it
Why would you make this pepper Ed 😯💯🇺🇲💭 Hot 🔥🥵🥵🥵🥵
Congrats to Klaus for being only the second person in the world to eat a whole Pepper X. It looked really intense.
Chili Klaus : Why did you invent that pepper?? 🤣🤣
Hottest thing I have ever experiences was FOX OC Spray at 5 mill SHU! In LE we carry that it was bad!
You can tell with those somber faces that they FULLY understand the seriousness of what they are about to do to themselves......
Hvad fanden laver chili klaus her?! Eller ja self skal han da være her, men vidste da ikk han var et “globalt navn” Kæmpe kado fra mig af🤝
We love Chili Klaus, man's a legend.
“What do you think about the flavor”, lol. He should’ve said “tastes like burning!!!”
Noah and Ed are Legends
the guinness guy is an actor on squid game's reality show
Ed and his wonderful team deserve all of the fame, fortune and success they've earned. It takes a lot of hardwork and dedication to persevere decade after decade. Ed is humble, hardworking, and Amazing! God Bless him❤❤❤
Ed is not a human,cant be 😂
He aint humble hes just made he didn't patent the Carolina reaper, the pepper x is solely for profits for him. He even took peoples peppers to make pepper x so humble he is not 😂
What is GOD doing here ? :))
Pepper X is actually a great name.
bro gives the longest intro like just say his name and bring him on set dont need ur whole backstory
Yeah I think Ed is immune to peppers
Claus🤣
Bell pepper nose
Ed barely reacting is insane. lol
You need Johnny Scoville on the show. It's a piece of cake for him.
This is so amazing and moving, lit these guys guts are moving.
Ed taking over the show after the men ate Pepper X….
I came here because I just ate a reaper and I'm already looking towards my next conquest. My body is collapsing
I was fearful for chili k lol glad to see you Superman thru it! Thanks hot ones. Long live Smokin Ed
Ed is such a sweetheart and clearly an amazing person to work with.
Smokin' Ed Currie is a CHAMPION. Look at how he just takes it.
I'm going to try the pepper X is it actually legit super hot I went to the website and they rated it 14/10 lol let's say I'm going to put it in my mac and cheese or  egg roll obviously I'm not going to put the whole bottle I'm just going to like a few drops
Congratulations Ed and his Team! "I'm in heat!" LOL
5 people in the world have eaten the pepper whole... 4 of them are here...
Awesome, Chili Klaus! How many snaps will we get this time.
Impressive that the one guy just dosen't react
I dont really like spicy anything, but i love ed and his love for making hot peppers. The emotion in his voice when he tried to thank everyone involved just put a big smile on my face. Its great to see people doing what they love and being recognized for it and seeing the joy it brings them.
I Love eating Hot Peppers. These Peppers I Don't find them Fresh Markets .To Eliminate The Heat Is drink Hot tea.
Wouldn't matter what flavor that pepper taste like, pretty sure the heat won't let you enjoy it anyway...
This one felt so YouTubey.
"Im alittle excited man" -Smokin Ed Curry
THIS WILL MAKE A LEGENDARY HOLIDAY GIFT
Is Ed Curie a relative of the family that discovered radioactivity? 😂😂😂 jk
The klaus I’m in heat moment…I was rolling on the floor 😂😂😂💀
They seemed way more bothered by the reaper tbh
Didn't Ed make that pepper years ago how is it just now being recognized as the hottest pepper
3 Legends. This is classic. Yall still missing Ted Berrus
Earthy flavor, yeah sure, they're talking about the flavors youll taste like it didn't just destroy your sense of reality and send your soul to another plane of existence.
SEAN ONLY HAD A SLIVER!? FOR SHAME, YOU NEED TO BRING YOUR ALL FOR CHILI CLAUS!
Klaus: I'm in heat 😂😂😂😂😂  "Did you invent that?"  "Yeah!"  "Why?"  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ed did what Sean does where he tries to make the other person feel like he's going through it with him 😂
"Did you do that? Did you invent that pepper?"  Yeah...   WHY!?
Kinda wonder what would happen if we introduced these to the wild by planting them there.
Someone pleeeeease give these brave men some MIIIIIIIIIIILK!!!!
Ed is such a humble guy that just loves his craft, and he loves it so much
freakin love these guys. Klaus my nordic brother is amazing
I'm not dare enough to taste the current Hottest pepper in the world beating out the carolina Reaper 10 years. This is the most painful pepper in the world pepper X
You know that scene from "Airplane!" where Leslie Nielsen starts narrating the symptoms of the affliction and the poor pilot starts twisting as he goes through each stage? this 11:58
that’s actually insane
Award presentation at 6:18
There's so much concern behind that "why?" At the end😂
they eat hot pepper the hottest peppers
Can we please get some pepper X peppers to Johnny Scoville.  If it's REALLY 2.6 MILLION SHU Johnny will know and say.
We need a gordon ramsey collab with chill klaus
Reminds of when Chili Klaus ate peppers with that woman in Africa. She was feeling how he did in this. 😂 Also, he skipped the whole water treatment he used to do.
Klaus is a madman.  Immediatly popping that thing and going for it after being told by Ed himself that it should be around 3 times hotter than a reaper.
Ed was more fazed by the world record than the pepper
The saw the guiness guy in the new squid game series or am I tripping?
10:21 When they actually start to eat then
Amazing
Made me cry! <3
Klaus begging to be put out of his misery
Eu mudaria pra Green Reaper. Pepper X é muito genérico.
I guess these chilis can be used as fuel in spaceships. We will be able to fly far away on it. Hahaha😊
Every guys dream should be to find a woman who loves him as much as Ed loves peppers 😂
Is this the pepper that was created in a lab and doesn't have an actual name but a letter number designation?
He eclipsed his own pepper by another million scoville... jeebus
Ed is not human!  Feels like eat a strawberry 🍓
I commend those heat seekers, because I wouldn't eat Pepper X unless I got a check up with an approval from my doctor and then! there'd have to be $10,000 check to go with it, so I guess you know I'll never be trying Pepper X
I’ve never seen someone so passionate about peppers than Ed Currie. I love how he gets emotive when receiving the world record and how he thanks his team. Such a great man!
I loooovvveee the set up. Two people on one side is chilling and the other two is dying 🤣🤣🤣
RIP
Ed is not human
12:33 BRUH EDS THE GOAT💀💀💀he’s hilarious
the look ed gives the dude on the right at 11:18 💀
11:10 no one:   the owl outside by bedroom window at 3am:
I would love to try that sauce. A coworker gave me a bottle of Carolina reaper sauce and I dump that stuff on scrambled eggs, in sauce that I use on chicken sandwiches/ French fries/ boiled eggs
Talking while Suffering from something hot like that makes it so much worse. Breathing air past your tongue can’t feel worse
Still the best video that reinvigorated my interest in the channel again
Subtotal $22.00 Shipping $29.00 Total USD $51.00  bit much for a bottle of hotsause lol
Crybabies. You should just eat the pepper and take it like a man...😄
La beast this is for you my friend
I want to see a deer accidentally wander into the field and eat one of these.
I'd like to see Nasty C here on the channel 🇿🇦🔥🔥
Any time Chili Klaus show up, stop the presses! I have to watch.  That dude is awesome.
Ed has been a family friend of ours for years... still weird to see him all over YouTube nowadays
You can feed this to criminals and they'll confess everything
Ed got WRECKED😂
I guess all the guests Klaus had were watching this video with great pleasure 🙂 Also: congrats to Smokin' Ed Currie for this chilli!! :)
Not gonna lie, Pepper X sounds like a War crime.... im so down where do i get this.
There needs to be a “I’m in Heat” sauce
I love that the second person in the world to eat a whole Pepper X is Chili Klaus! Score for Denmark man! He is so awesome!
I'm ordering two bottles right now! Congrats Ed, Xtremely well deserved!!!
Ed sounds a little bit like Cleveland, doesn't he?
Tell me how the guy who made it ate it like Candy
klaus went popeye mode
Ed is a beast he took the heat of that like a champ man God Bless lol
Why is this so emotional. lol 🤭🤭🤣🤣😂😂
Yes congratulations Ed 😇
That's a NOPE pepper 🌶
I can't stand ed...that guy loves the sound of his own voice far too much.
🤩🤩🤩
"I am in heat" 😂😂😂
Ed: "Even though I don't look it, I'm feeling just like Klaus is feeling. These guys are right now feeling there's an intense burn that happens immediately..... *goes on* ...but that comes on later, when you're in pain. I've got a little bit of a tear in my eye." Klaus: "I'm in heat... I'm in heat! .....Oooh. I'm done."
Ed is so stoically watching everybody.
Congrats to Ed Currie and his team I love the videos of hot ones as well especially this one
That pepper even looks line the devil would avoid it😂
If Ed started asking Sean questions? 😂
Bought and paid for hottest pepper 🙄😡.......
Klaus looks like he had a slow but very effective reaction. But, nobody is fuming at the ears more than those big corporations who couldn't get their claws on that beautiful pepper.. Good job, guys! 👌
That's awesome!  I'm glad for all of you to be able to share that moment!  I think you're all crazy, but I love it!  Keep on doing what you do!
this <3
Yo ed is a fuck8mg monster 😮
Greetings from Denmark 🇩🇰
It just looks like something you shouldn't be eating. 😬. I wouldn't.
We alsmot witnessed a man have a heart attack for the purpose of science 😂
I think Ed is a freak with no heat sensors. He's just trolling people!
Como faço para ter ela?
Awesome video. Edd is a study. Hoping a few of these are sent out to Johnny Scoville, and the UK Chili Queen.
This had me in tears😂
I'm glad the views on this video beat Cardi B.
"Oh no, Klaus is breeding!" is the line I keep coming back for 😂
The burn on the toilette tho 😂
We need a ‘follow-up video’ to talk about the 24 hours after eating it. LOL
I'M READY FOR HIS SNAPPNG FINGERS lol
“I’m in Heat”  You’re in heaven? “I’m in Heat” 😂😂
Its only fitting that the inventor of pepper x have a high resistance like a snake and its venom
I grew a few scorpion and reaper plants years ago. When I harvested the scorpions, I sliced them then dried them in a dehydrator for 2 months. During that time they put off an amazingly sweet smell that was totally unexpected.
Michigan Hot!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
The pepper spray that is going to be done with this. $
Shouldn't count if we can't enjoy it as well!
I love all these guys, can't wait to try my 1st jalapeno next month..
People don't understand how painful this is, eating a full raw pepper x is worse than birth pain
I'm in heEaAt...
I’m not crying 😢 it’s the hot sauce 😢👏👏👏👏❤️🥰🖖
Don't play poker with Ed
"I think there is some oak in it, and pencil." I'm dying laughing, so funny.
That Klaus guy kind of looks like the Klaus from John Wick 4 without tats
Sean kinda pussed out not eating a whole one
The Scoville scale is logarithmic!? Naa, that doesn't make any sense.
Big congrats to Ed but the fact that Scoville is logarithmic was the scariest thing I've heard all week
Claus: "did you really invent that?" Him proudly: yes! Claus suffering: why!?
12:20 epic quote from Claus , I love him
I love ed 😂
On behalf of all of us here in South Carolina, congrats ED! We don't get many people from here that do cool stuff, (hot stuff in your case). I can't wait to see what ED comes up with next.✌️
It has some subtle tones of citrus and-PAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNNNNNN OH MY GOD I'M ON FIRE!!!!!!!!!!
Klaus is in heat
I hope he gets rich enough to fix all his teeth <3
Where I can buy pepper x?
Just gonna say it says Sean ate it. They lied. He nippled on a tiny piece. Least tell the truth
Very fitting for a Chili Klaus to take this on. His Viking Ancestors would be proud lol
Now’s not the time for throat burn…That comes later.
Lorde eating Pepper X: "Mmmmm it has that sourbess to it which gives Pepper X a nice flavor "
um roller skates and space shuttles... they arent animals
Why didn’t they eat a ripe one?
everyone in the comments that actually believes this is factual is not a real chili head. the guys a fraud! all these people around Ed are paid off to support the scam.
Id love to try ine of these some day, the pepper itself, not the sauce
I rewound just to make sure Ed Currie actually ate one, while everyone is almost dying he just stands there having a good time 😂
lol det så ud til den kunne få klaus i knæ :)
No one has hick-ups?
I checked the pepper X, it's nothing compared to the Romanian pepper I got from a town called Buzau.  True, the Romanian one is just pain and no flavor.
Hands down the best video you have done. You are all Legends in my mind.
Rhett and link is crying right now
I bet Chili Klaus regrets his life choices after eating Pepper X. His face says it all. 😂
Ed going straight into thanking his team made me really happy. Congratulations to them!
Legends 🙏 Love the content, Love Chili Klaus, congrats on the new pepper X ! 👏👏👏
Klaus is breeding.
How’s your hole 🤣
Lol, "I'm in heat"... I assume he meant "I'm on fire" but the way he said it is definitely funnier.
Those teeth
That’s not a real Guinness official
"I love the flavour I think there's some oak in it And... pencil"  lol
That chili looks absolute fire. 🔥
One of the best ever episodes
Klaus is now pregnant.
The question is: is klaus OK?
Apparently It's very spicy
I like peppers, but I'm not suicidal!!!
"Did you invent that pepper?" "Yes" "Why?" 😂
I would like to see that tictok pepper eating guy try this pepper. Lol
bruh.. i will get slowly up with less spices xDD
This was so funny 🤣😂😂 Did you invent this? ... why 🤣🤣🤣
Send one to Johnny Scoville at chase the heat
I'm glad he's on our side
Wow, I can't wait to try this!
Sean is so sweet 🥺🥹
You crazy Alchemists, suffering for your art
He says cost me more money. Spend some on them teeth ed gross
So is Pepper X actually legit then. For a long time when it was announced all the pepper heads were really disappointed and said it wasn't even as hot as a reaper. Even people who tried both last dabs said the Pepper X ones were a lot more underwhelming compared to the reaper/scorpion variants.
😮
“I’m in heet” :D
Smokin' Ed Currie looked like he was chewing on a stick of Juicy Fruit. 😂😂
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤congrats 2 all survivors
Habanero is as far as I'll go. A man has to know his limitations.
"Why???"
Klaus doing a good owl impression 11:09
When the guy held back the tears and composed himself was the best moment!  Congratulations! 🎉
Why are Americans so emotional 😅
I'm now convinced that Ed isn't human 😳
klaus sweating before he starts the first bite🤣. To the editor who added 'Im In Heat' at the end, thank you.
Worst actors in human history
No Thank you
I love chili claus reactions 😅 i always laugh
Ed is such a real dude. I'm gonna go visit him from Iva SC very soon.
I get that face tighter thing watching this video from laughing 😂😂😂
Flavor? When something is that hot, it tastes like burning plastic dipped in battery acid. Is that a flavor? This pepper is a notable accomplishment and these guys are justifiably super proud, but this is like waxing poetic about the subtleties of dropping your male member in boiling water versus a white hot poker.
Who best kept thier cool running the gauntlet? 'The mayor of flavortown'?  Can they handle this level of heat?
My saliva drips when I see hot chillies. Is that normal?
Onde consigo comprar dela? Sou do Brazil
As a Dane, I think it’s so cool Sean and Klaus are great pals😂🇩🇰
When eating hot peppers, I hope to be like Ed. It takes a special person to reach the....."ED ZONE" 🥵😵🫡👍
Guys i tried this and i couldnt move well for two hours and had stomach pain for a whole day I recommend you do not try this
Guiness gives records to authoritarian dictators.
Sean spiking the camera with pure fear in his eyes @10:36
Hahahahaha. Why????
I've eaten 2 Carolinas 4 ghost peppers and da bomb is hotter why?
How come women dont do this you got 4 men eating the hottest spicy pepper in the world lol
Klaus is the 1st person to eat pepper x and last lol
is it just me, or does pepper x look like a necrotic toe?
I thought Chili Klaus was about to turn Hulk 😮😮😮😮
Ed curry is the man these peppers he invents bring such joy an excitement to the world I can't wait to see all videos of people trying this pepper well done Ed an crew
Apparently the Primotalii pepper is hotter.
I started sweating just staring at the pepper.
Chilli Klaus!
Ed is the most passionate and frightening pepper creator/curator the world has ever know. And it all comes out of Rock Hill, South Carolina!
My love and respect for Ed 📈📈📈 He is the pepper king.
I grow carolina reapers...pick them with gloves. I can imagine one picks pepper X in a full body bio hazzard suit
I definitely need some seeds, hope I find a chance to buy them this year for the next season
Give it to Gordon Ramsey to chew 🤣 that would be the episode of the century )))
It's Like Drugs all The People Out Of Control
Ed telling the sensation of what you should feel while eating the pepper X when he’s just chilling out vs Kalisz who’s dying.
Why?
Ed calmly watches the two drama queens spazz out.
i couldent imagine
When you breed the peppers for maximum capsaicin, the peppers start looking bumpier and gnarlier. That's basically a good rule of thumb for hot chili peppers: the tinier and bumpier, the hotter they will be.
Sean acknowledging and thanking the Guinness book of records guy is good, just nice.
Claus came in to say  he’s in heat and then out. Legend
I just dont understand why people put themselves through torture? He asked why he made this pepper? WHY ARE YOU EATING IT??? Lol
all those feelings you get when you eat these peppers is your body telling you that you are killing yourself.
This is why Klaus hasn't aged. The face tightening effects of peppers keep him wrinkle-free.
I feel so sorry for their butholes. Real heroes here, ladies and gentlemen!
Oh my god I love Clause so much. The just, “I’m out.” 😂
Dude is like a horror movie director
Sean did not eat the pepper for real.
I laughed, I cried, I enjoyed every minute of this.    Who would have thought peppers could be so emotional.
"i HaVe A LiTtLe biT oF a tEaR iN mY eYe"...  😂
the “I AM IN HEAT” cracked me up so bad
He going to cry in the car.
Ed is a mad scientist
I'm in heat😂😂😂😂😂
Smokin Ed not only broke his previous record he blew that sucker out the water lol
Pepper X, newest hottest pepper and Twitter changing their name to X, 🤔 🧐 🤨
Thank you guys.
Ed has the vocal stylings of Ben Stein from Ferris Bueller's Day Off. This was an entertaining episode! 😂
but why?
Ed is the man! What a legend!
one of the most wholesome shows doing one of the most wholesome things just so great to have a brake during rough times
invite johhny scoville from chase the heat on here let em eat one with yall lol
Klaus is the 🐐
The “did you invent that pepper? Why?” at the end was the best part.
Stop stressing the words, so annoying
🔥
Beautiful 🎉
Weird that the hot ones sauce that claims 91% pure pepper X is no where near this heat when it should be.
Thank you Ed Currie for your passion and maintaining the purity of the peppers you have developed. As such, I went to Puckerbutts to make sure I get authentic reaper seeds.
Now it's time to come for that title to see what else you got in that vault.
I don't love the name of it
What a cool group of guys
Just watching this made me wriggle with a buzzy feeling
Pencil
Ed is like that lovable uncle but behind the scenes he is a mad scientist lol.
That was awesome that guy ed really loves his peppers u can tell he was gangster eating that pepper good job guys
Thaankyaw
This is so heartwarming massive congratulations to Smokin' Ed and the team keep rocking it guys much love and much respect!! 🔥😎👊🏼🌶🔥
I dont know why but I feel like Ed and Paul Stamets would be friends.
always fun
Never will Eat it colon won't let me☠️☠️☠️
that pepper is basically a chemical weapon and ed just eats it like its nothing.
These people are insane
The Elon Musk pepper
I’m not impressed with the sauce
Do u sell these seeds
Ed is just standing there chewing on it like its nothing.
Congrats Ed and Team! You are masters of your craft and art!
My eyes watered looking at it.
Loves when dude calmly starts explaining the burn when Sean and Klaus get slowed down for a sec!😁
Ed is a beast man he had the straightest face the whole time
Oak and pencil taste. Naiiiis 😂🤣😅😆😁😃
"Did you do that? Did you invent that pepper?"  "Yeah"  "Why?😢"
First off, congrats to Ed and the team, absolutely astonishing achievement! Second, Ed is a certifiable madman and should be locked up for societies safety.... (of course I'm kidding) but wow.. I was sweating just watching.
11:58 "I'm drowning here and you're describing the water" kind of moment.
Sean comforting him when he was awarded. So sweet.
Even a guy who's known right now on youtube for handling hot stuff better then anyone had a hard time with the new sauce stating its the hottest sauce hes had like for sauce of course lol. It's insane
That's hilarious. Thank you chaps, but I'm out. X
There's no way that's as hot as Los Calientes. No way.
I find people should be able to grow them
I heard they're not going to sell the seeds for pepper x Is that true
im scared of touching my face by just holding the phone.
Incredible moment!!!! It's all love and good vibes (and burning heat ^^) I don't know him but I'm really glad for Ed Currie: you can feel how this has been so  much work, teamwork,  and determination to achieve that strand of pepper, and preserve it. Congrats!!!!!
I love hot and spicy but when it gets this hot what its the point?
Klaus: ,,Thank you very much" (for the biggest pain in my life) Sean: ,,Yeah yeah" 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Scary that people would get corporations that would hire others to steal a super hot pepper. Corporate Pepper Pilfering.
12:40 this is the hardest I've seen Sean laugh like ever
Ed causally in the background high af smiling is a vibe
I want this as a pepper spray.
I bought the X sauce, i keep it in my truck for coworkers that spout off about liking hot stuff.
You sick sick man!
Do you have some kind of detox for these peppers if things get out of hand? for example, if you are bitten by a poisonous snake and you are given a detox injection to survive.
Ed is freaking crazy Genius when come to making peppers
I start sweating, and salivating every time I see Ed on a video. Ghost is the highest I could I ever go. These guys are freaking insane!!!
Ed is like that one friend i had back in the day who could eat a whole tenstrip of acid and be like “yeah man i’m good” meanwhile everybody is on a whole other plane of existence 😂👍
This was brilliant to watch. Thank you and congrats to that record!
Did they ask Elon Musk to name that pepper?
I think I would die straight up
Klaus is in heat and Pepper X is much hotter than his Scandinavian cousins.
This is truly the work of a mad scientist. 😂
Oh I have to try it!!!!
And there's also round 2, in the bathroom when the pepper comes out.
Congrats SMokin’ Ed!!!
Must have been fun coming out!🔥
After 1 Pepper X. Sean and Klaus are dying - Ed is giving live commentary on what they probably feel. Hilarious. :D
Those teeth definitely been chewing alot of peppers Ed
Why is the Pepper X so unattractive? The Reaper was beautiful. Did you Ed C have any control on the appearance?
Sean just ate a sliver of one and it rocked him lol wow a whole one would be hellfire 👺👺👺
Klaus is on heat
ed eatin candle wax
Klaus will probably block all your phone numbers now 😂😂😂
May i buy this recipe bottle? thank you..
I love Ed. He is amazing! The reasoning behing what he does...i watch his YouTube videos and i am just amazed at his patience with what he does. And it seriously makes him happy!
Their @ssH@oles must hate them.
the hottest peppers look evil.  ed is the pepper king for sure.
This is some real pepper passion
Protect Ed at all costs!
Nothing like a pepper high
This single episode has sparked a whole interest in Ed and hot peppers
Ed almost broke down crying when saying thank you for the World Record. But eating the X, just another monday :D
I love chili klaus's beard
Chili Klaus is so funny 🤣😂❤💞
Are the veneers new or am I missing something?
Why? Why not!?
It's safe to say I will never eat one of those peppers.....thanks for an enjoyable video....
So I bought this new hot sauce and let me say I’m underwhelmed with its heat. No face burn, throat burn, no chest burn and no extremity sensations. It just made me sweaty with a little tongue tingle.
How is it that the 2 on the right are not even sweating 😂
Why would any sane person do this to themselves?
I had to continue watching to see who would be wheeled out by the paramedics,
I gotta get this. Amazing achievement.
I think ya'll broke Chili Klaus
I really want to try pepper X after seeing that! Pepper X vindaloo sounds tasty.
(1) humans have to be on both sides off something to measure it length.. tone... and light.       (2) close eyes it's never been light inside where your soul is because your soul is in the FUTURE B4 light created.  1/2 god and one side of light  (3)  Open eyes.. foggy area around peripheral is time and space forming B4 light created and bounces off atoms slower than light and BACK TO YOU IN THE FUTURE SINGULARITY DARK B4 light... the light is the PAST AFTER LIGHT "created" center vision 2 eyes to simulate one god view,   (4) you always walk around in the MIDDLE OF CREATING CREATION ..b4 words children never questioned god as they felt it and didn't think or speak they are so in awe...  your on both sides of light to see it and the frequency red apple red light room... you must... travel b4 light created or everything would be ONE COLOR
sorry but the Chocolate Primotalii is still the Hottest in the world until this idiot releases this so called pepper X
Klaus is back!
If its that hot coming in, whats it like when it comes out   AM IN HEAAAT!
Never seen me fellow countryman Klaus being so scared of trying a chili 😂
Make some pepper spray  our old that.
Hot
Klaus is breeding
Can’t wait to homegrow these; been growing reapers for years now and they’re lovely when used right. Really nice flavour
I bet he has a hotter one in the roster incase someone beats this one lol
He has to protect his work. He bred the Carolina Reaper too and every corporation and hot sauce maker stole it from him. He lost millions in profits.
I wanna make a mash with brine and no vinegar.
Can you name these people who doubted you please so they can live in shame? Thanks.
too hilarious, :)
😅😅
🎉🎉
@FirstWeFeast.  You should get Johnny Scoville on your show.
Pepper X = walk in the park
people getting high on the internet :D i like that, now try ketamine
Yes indeedy,....Smokin' E. Currie take a bow,....dude, you didn't even flinch,....I enjoy hot sauce/ chili peppers,...and I've tried a bite of an orange habanero,...& it ruined me for about 15 minutes,....S.M.C. is da man!.
Ed seems like a humble standup dude. Nothing better than seeing people like him succeed and get their props.
Flavor of the pepper is pain
'Oh no... Klaus is breeding' 🤣
In London I saw some Indian guys around Bethnal Green eating spicy chicken with what they said it was the spiciest chilli ever. They were betting money in a square like you'd bet on dice. One of them fainted as if Tyson Fury would have hammered him. Passed out cold
The "Why" from Chilli Claus is so funny 😂
Need Kevin hart to taste it
It even looks evil! 😂
Y'all should have Johnny Scoville on
This is ICONIC.
Chili Claus is the Best ever, "I'm in heat!"😂
"Pencil!" Lol
"I'm in heat...  I'm in heat...  I'm in heat"  🤣😂🤣😂🤣
That has to be the first time I’ve seen Chili-Klaus speechless. 😂❤
I'm watching this while pouring Tabasco on my lunch
This is a beautiful historic moment and be the most sought after product of 2023/2024. Congratulations to Mr. Pepper X ❤️🎉❤️🎊
I think the gauntlet would push me to the edge bad I can’t lie, but this pepper would genuinely send me into cardiac arrest   I wouldn’t even want to be in the same room as that thing
“i’m….in… i’m in….. i’m in heat”
Great video!
This is mandatory YouTube viewing .
Ha, ha 😂😅 I’m laughing, crying & enjoying watching these guys give there critique on Pepper X
Awesome! Now I need to see Smokin' Ed eat one with David Blaine!
I've seen lots of your interviews.  Nice to see something different, really showed your interview chops.
Me: there’s no way I’m eating this Ed: Klaus, you’re the first person in the whole wide world to eat a whole pepper-x besides me Me: we ball
Ed took that chili like a champ. That's crazy.
That thing even looks angry just sitting on that dish. I hate hot and spicy food, I can't handle the burn or the stomach pain/acid. I would probably be going to A&E on the first hot sauce he usually tries with guests. I couldn't imagine what I'd be like if these guys found it a bit much....dead probably.I'm sure people must've had heart attacks eating this kind of spicy food😬
As if this was ever about the culinary part of anything. This is just going over the top in a lower form of food poisoning
Poor Klaus! That looked like it hurt!. I’m reviewing chili peppers myself in my channel, but would absolutely NOT dare to take a bite of that 🔥 of a pepper😂
Ed Currie is the scariest man alive!!!
"It continues..." 😂 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Did i miss something why did Sean only take a sliver... Medical issue? he never backs down
Harry FINALLY doing hot ones!!
What about jenny schovile he says chocolate promotali is the hottest he has had
Ed is a beast!
Why?
Sean sounded so high in his outro!! haha
Can you breed Carolina reaper with X now
🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶 Congrats 🙂 🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶
The next day morning: The rocket is ready for launch. 3, 2,1 liftoff!
I want like a dozen for my chilli 😁😁😁
I think Andy from Guiness should have to eat one. Contrats to Mr. Ed Currie.  Wow! Ed is so cool, calm and collective after eating the hottest pepper in the world.  And NO, you never get use to it.
There's a *real problem* with this pepper. Ed is not releasing the seeds, according to PuckerButt, never ever. No whole peppers either. Its like he made a car that can reportedly do 500mph but decided to leave it parked in the garage for all eternity. So I suppose we'll all just have to take everyone's word that its as hot as you say it is. Great.
Is Klaus ok.....jesus
Well Done Ed and Team Wow After dealing with Covid I sure hope both Pepper X and Apollo are Available as Seeds and Sold as packaged peppers available at all markets/farmers markets and online as well 👍
Awesome and congrats I definitely gotta try that sauce
Is Klaus still standing?
I love Chilli Claus
Ed eating his pepper like a cheese.
Chili Klaus is my new favorite internet person 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂.
Ed is the hot pepper God. Not to be surpassed in our lifetime.
Those peppers don't even look real bro. They look alien. Weird color and shape
Jesus Christ is Lord, King and Our Savior!
this guy is  a madman, he actually got more peppers that are actually spicier than pepper x, and he lines them up in case someone actually tries to challenge them for the world's hottest pepper
Said do I look like Taylor Swift
We know what it does going in. I want to know what damage it does coming out?
Man, I teared up too!! Congratulations!!
disappointed you didnt eat a whole chili
You guys are my people! It's like the show See... all of us pepper people actually created a pepper that made us go blind and everyone else couldn't handle it and died off. Then we just flourished as blind pepperheads not knowing what happened to the world because our great pepper also erased our memories... 😁
Sean and Klaus just dying standing up while Ed is just "Fire? I was born of this"
Did you invent that pepper?..... Yeah .... Why?🤣🤣🤣
Man I can't wait I ordered a bottle to try with family and friends
Two guys with an extreme fetish enjoying the suffering of two guys with a kink* is a more appropriate video title.
This is LEGENDARY
Careful around the eyes, Ed.
What's a 'come up'?
You broke chili klaus XD
Congratulations Ed Currie  Your truely Awsome far beyond what you realize. Thank you for your work and thank you to the whole team at puckerbutt pepper company.    Love you guys and keep up the great work ... can't wait to start my seeds  for next years growing season....  bless up 💚
Good god pepper X is scary lookin lol
Well bring on ...one chip challenge hurry up ...i need some moneyyyyyyyyygyyyyy
Klaus: Did you do that? Did you invent this? Ed: Yes. Klaus: Why??? 🤣🤣🤣
YESSS HI to Chili Klaus from Denmark
Congratulations Ed!  I'm sure you have a hotter one in your back pocket that perhaps we'll see within the next 10 years as well.  When you reveal that one, I'm sure you will already be working on one or two more even hotter!  Unbeliveable how Chili Klaus was taken down while Ed maintained his composure!!  🌶🥵♨
Chili Klaus is in heat! Klaus min danske broder, jeg elsker dine direkte oversættelser! det er smukt! :D
i’d watch a heist moving of some big corpo hiring a crew to try and steal Ed’s secret super spicy peppers
“no one has been able to top us” yea Ed you’re kinda in a class of you’re own.
HEC YAEH GO ED!!!!
Wow! Ed and family are happy as happy can be. Great! work gentlemen. Ed ate pepper x with the crew and he had a grin as he chewed his creation.🔥
I love how Ed responds the same way old heads do after decades of experiencing LSD. It's still hitting him, but he's just so much better at keeping it together.
The Carolina Reaper looks like an alien scorpion that will sting you and leave you to die. Pepper X is like an alien plant that you approach out of curiosity, and despite knowing it might be dangerous, as you approach it with caution, it just devours you whole in two seconds.
An i wanna see Johnny Scoville eat this too x
I wanna see the "spice king" Cam who shows no reaction to eat this 🤣🤣🤣 x
Eating a Pepper X should count as ‘Cruel and Unusual Punishment’. 🖕🏻
music underneathe is annoying
is this pepper legit or is it like the reaper?
Glad they mentioned the Flavor. That fruity Aroma is the Reason Im not a big Fan of the Reaper. Looking forward to taste the Pepper X some day.
LOL - Claus. "im in heat" - not realising what that mean in english
I want some straight peppers to toss in the smoker.
huge fan of Chilli Claus (Godt gået Chilli Claus :D
What do you think about the flavor Klaus?
This Ed seems like a great guy I like that pep talk at 10:28. Very nice
So 4 guys takes the chili and 2 of them in unaffected and the 2 others are dying?
I like the way people look scared eating my hot sauce  -ed  currie 😮
Klaus turned into bubber
The insanity is real, condolences on your sacrifice Klaus!
Can you die from eating that pepper?
What’s with everything in 2023 having the letter X in it?
11:15 That smile says it all. LOL
Still a liars nobody will ever know the truth because this liar won’t release it to prove it! Nobody’s taking the paid off word of  Guinness. Your still a fraud until it’s in the hands of the public!
These guys got paid a lot to put that act on!
I love chilli klaus
Pepper X just morphed Sean Evans into Dana White
I have such a spicy food addiction but my spice tolerance is too high and I feel like I can't ever get my fix. I'm going to have to try pepper X. I feel like one of those perverts that can't feel anything so they try hellraiser cenobites.
SHOUT OUT FORT MILL, SC
This is a tremendous pursuit of excellence
Chili Klaus and Sean have such a fun rapport it's almost too bad it got destroyed so quickly by Pepper X. Though have to admit Klaus had some hilarious comments before he tapped out. Would love to see a follow up conversation with him about the aftermath of eating Pepper X.
I ate two Carolina reaper chillies in School when I was 15 I loved spicy food and I was relatively fine. I gave the chillies out to 12 other lads and they all had to go home. However when I got home I had to sit on the toilet for hours, the sting was legendary. Godspeed Klaus's toilet.
I swear I’m sweating watching them eat this hahaha
Ed is the KING !!! He is absolutely not fazed !! 😀 😀 😀
Klause im in heat made had me dying 😂
“I mean I had completely skipped the tingle phase and went straight to the drool phase”.  - Jordan Belfort
FORK YOU GUYZ ARE NUTZ!! 😂  Congrats to Smok’n Ed ya Beast!!  And always a show when Klaus is around with Sean. What a Number that was!! 🥵
Im in heat is the best part
THAT CRUNCH
I really love what youve built here, Sean. Its beautiful to see how youve brought the boys along.
When Klaus says oak all I hear is ‘poke in it’. Try and unhear it now especially after he says pencil.
Too bad this guy paid guiness to give him the record, its marketing folks this whole videos a giant ad
"Did you invent that pepper?" "Why?"
Probably my new favorite video. They’re the best.
I don't ever want to hear another person say whites can't handle spicy food.
I will never eat his peppers. But I do love Smokin Ed.
@1:55 ”raised the heat level to something we THOUGHT WAS GOING TO BE the maximum” Ed and his team have not spent the last ten years twiddling their thumbs. Can only imagine the next pepper in the war chest waiting to be unleashed!
Im in Heat. lol
I didn't know rollerskates and spaceships are animals.
Lol Chilli is the man
Will I ever get to eat a whole pepper?
Humans are fascinatingly weird.
Wonder how many lawsuites from heart attacks etc.
I love the heat but I'm nearvous about this pepper !!!
Is Klaus ok??
Sean refusing to eat Pepper X both excites and worries me
You shouldn't sweat while watching this
Ed is what we call a Trip Guide 😂
Just broke a sweat watching this...
Klaus made this video perfect, but seeing Sean getting torn up by the sliver he ate really drove the point home about how insane Pepper X actually is.  I definitely enjoyed the Xperience sauce, but it's best used in moderation!
Every time I go on the site everything is always sold out
CIA watching this like 😃
🌌👏😁🌶🌌
That pepper blows your head ace dack pouch right the fawk off😂
How ironic, Ed's worried about someone stealing "his" peppers.😂😂😂
🤣🔥👍👍
Way to go Ed!
Oh no! Klaus is breathing! lol
Ive been waiting for chili klaus to make a return on the channel
oh, my gosh,  poor Sean's trippin'!!! wait, wait...here comes Chili....."whhhyyyy????"
This is a legitimate documentary,  Mr. Evans, and the fact that he goes right to gratitude for his team. Good folks.
Oh boy turn the hobby into  several Guinness world records  !!!  🔥....way to go my friend , way to go ! And you can see the passion in his voice when he talks about him and his team, absolutely phenomenal !!
Whenever people say white people can't handle spice, I'm always like, "well, yeah, or they're so crazy they make the spiciest peppers on the planet and eat them on the reg 😂"
I'm still eating habaneros. I do wish to graduate to the next step tho.
Klaus' reaction made this episode
03:44/Sounds a lot like the psych profile of a serial arsonist 😂😂😂
i m.o the yellow Trinidad moruga Scorpion Chillis are the tastiest....😊
I was afraid to touch my eyes just by watching this.
"Did you invent thay pepper..... YES .... Why?!?!'🤣🤣🤣 SPOKEN LIKE HE JUST MADE FRANKENSTEIN 🤣
He is on heat, hahahahaha
“I’m in heat”  “Klaus is breeding”  😂
Can we get a wellness check on Klaus? Has anyone heard from him since this video???
Then everyone threw up.
Ed is such a sweet, sadistic man lol
There's no point
I'd love to send a borsch marinaded in pepper x to Vladimir Putin.
It's so good to see people with such a passion for their work and see them succeed!!! I love this
Well-earned record and emotion. Good on ya!
This looks so brutal , and you guys are pros...
i just got my pepper x seeds, cant wait for the babys to grow
7:16 i feel ya homie.  Congrats to all involved.
"I'm in heat" sent me off a cliff 😂😂😂😂😂
its crazy how ed's able to speak perfectly well after eating it he truly is the mayor of scoville
Put this in my MARIJUANA/ clone
Watching a group of people who are so passionate about what they do is amazing. Huge congrats to Ed and the team on the World Record. Klaus is one of a kind and the all-time greatest guest.
Well done, Ed! Congratulations to you and your entire team for your dedicated work to this project. It leaves me wondering what you have up your sleeve for the next one.
CONGRATS! This emotional Reaction got me man!!!!!! <3
"Why?"...
I've probably rewatched this like 20 times by now. Probably my favorite video of yours
the color of his teeth though o_o
Too much tag line for pepper x. "Im in heat" "Pencil" "It continues" "Why?"
Ah this is good
Wait, I don't know a lot about these guys. How is Ed eating his pepper unfazed?
Wherw can you buy the pepper x not the sauce but the pepper?
I’m definitely gonna try this
OK...now we need Lord and Dave Grohl to DOUBLE GUEST. They were the OG kings--now, who can withstand the X?!
This is by far the best episode yet!  We love you, Chili Klaus - "I'm in heat..."  Congratulations to, Ed and the team. :)
What do mean? What do you mean?
@SteveO
They should just mark the spice level as: industrial
I love everything about this!
Sean why
Corbel headasszss
Sean should have eaten a whole one
Now to order a bottle.....
What does it say that Ed choked up during the award but not after eating the pepper? This is an amazing human right here.
Smokin' Ed is nothing short of being a brilliant mad scientist. I see the pain inflicted on these lords of hot peppers, and I still want to try it. Why?! Why?!!!!!!
Johnny Scoville would skool you guys and love you guys ❤
Awh Ed!! Got me tearing up !
Ed is obviously a very smart and genuine guy. So we’ll spoken. His product is amazing.
How did they independently verify the level. If Ed said he had it under lock and key. He wouldn't let anyone else check it.
Chili Klaus is awesome!
Did anyone else catch that the Scoville heat index is a logarithmic scale, rather than a straight ascending scale? And that, according to Ed, it's 3x's hotter than the reaper?
I want to grow it.  I have been growing Reapers for 4 yrs now   This is awesome
I’m in heat!😂
I don’t understand why ppl are mean to Ed on other forums and videos
Get these to rhett and link
Witnessed a guy at work have a heart attack and eventually die eating a hot pepper. These levels are getting beyond raw edible.
It's the outtro that will hurt
1:44 really only a single word away from ending up on a watch list
Watching this made my tv sweat😳
I am here for Chii Klaus. That guy rocks.
Yikes, watch your eyes! Finger by your eyes... NOOOOO!
I love these guys especially Ed such a pure soul.
I want one named "Pepperation H".
My standard is right now, is Scorpion Tabasco. I use small amounts of ghosts and Carolina reaper in my foods. and sauces. I even like making homemade Sriracha and altering my store bought hot sauces and making then actually hot and flavorful.
Seeing Sean break down is so funny
A true horticultural achievement.
It’s to hot to laugh
Ed aint human 😢
When are you going to have Kenny Omega
I dunno…I’ve tried a jalapeño (just the one) that had NOOOOOO business being That hot
(I 'm in heat) will go down in history 😂😂
Need to see the atomik menace try this!!
Why 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I received my bottle of XPERIENCE yesterday and tried it 3xs today (increasing amount) at work and am addicted. I love the earthy, almost smoky flavor. The aroma is inviting. Comparing it to a good Kentucky bourbon.
I want to eat half of one
Guinness isn't official, it's a marketing company. The pepper guys are cool, though. Great work!
The real battle is tomorrow. 🛐
How the world did i just sweat from looking at this video? 😂😂😂
Sadistic. I love it.
Gotta ask... why?
My mouth is watering just by watching them :p
I feel like the worst part that no one talks about is the aftermath lol. I ate a reaper once and yeah the heat was bad but it went away. A few hours later is when the real torture started, worst stomach pains of my life.
it doesn´t get more biased than this lol
Smokin Ed is dead inside - In a good way
.... Ed LYING he not even red.
is it tasty and hot? or just painful. I love spicy.. but I've tried sauces that's just painful with none of the taste or spiciness... just painful. I don't like those.
so, are you tellin' me this is what gave the Powerpuff Girls their powers? -chemical- pepper X?
"Did you invent that pepper?" "Yeah." "WHY???" 😂😂😂
The trilogy is complete, took 7 years, but glad to see these two together again
10:30 is what i wanna be remembered for doing, one day
Claus question and reply to Ed had me cracking up. - Ed.. Did you create this pepper? - Yes.. -Why? 😂
You gotta feel for Ed. He created the Carolina Reaper and he and his family have not benefitted as much as they should've from it. Corporations were making all the money off his back and didn't give him his fair share. I hope pepper X is different.  Also, theres no doubt Ed has a lineup of peppers that are hotter than this. You don't just make the hottest pepper ten years ago and stop.
The I'm in heat comment made my cry 😂😂
"I think there's some oak in it"😂😂😂😂😂
Ed seems like a genuinely nice guy!
Ed Currie is a genetic anomaly ! How does he do it ???
Chili Klaus is back!!!
I love heat and I could never do this 🤣☠️
Ed is the hot pepper god 😂😂
Well one of them is called daddy 😂 🔥
Chili Klaus: "Did you invent that?" Smokin' Ed Currie: “Yes.”  Chili Klaus: "Why?"   LOL
Praise the LORD for creating peppers.
Why keep creating this awful peppers
WOW.. CONGRATS ED!
Did you invent that pepper? Why?  😅
"I'm in heat" - say no more Klaus - I am in stitches 🫰🫰🫰
Klaus is the man
Is the Apollo Pepper (in theory) hotter than Pepper X?  If so when will Ed seek for Guinness to certify it?
When it comes to chilli... It is ed's domain...
Instant classic
So fun! Absolutely love this.  Congrats Ed and team. Gotta get some.
F that!
I wanna see @spiceking eat one lol
I appreciate what these guys accomplished but I wouldn’t go near that pepper lol
Shoulda made Andy eat one too. Haha 🌶️ Ed is just delightful. And totally does look like a young Taylor Swift.
I was genuinely worried about Clause lol if he couldn’t it’s over.
Ed is the new Chili Klaus...lol
Needs to take all that excitement and brush his teeth with it
I react the same after eating sriracha   sauce
Im sweating just watching this
Chili Klaus is the best
I feel bad for chilli Claus he's actually hit his limit. And asking why.
There is no word in English of what Claus was trying to say.  In Spanish it is called enchilado.  It means you are suffering the effects of something that is too spicy and you are in an ecstatic state of euphoria from the pain of eating too much hot stuff.
"It's very spicy."  "I love the flavor."
I started making my own hot sauce.   Easy 3 ingredients.  1.  The peppers of choice.  2.  Sliced onions,  4 onions to 1 pepper. About two fistful of salt.  This makes about half gallon of delicious hot sauce.  The salt draws out the onion juice and you just let it sit in a dark place for a few days.  You can add vinegar or saurkraut brine if you need that sour flavor but it is perfect with just onions and salt.
Spice boys
Thank god Ed Currie has made enough money through peppers to afford an adamantium toilet.
I do not understand. I have never understood. I will probably never understand.
Ed Currie needs to be introduced to a periodontist by his psychologist.
Lol his face instantly turned red 🥵
Very thoughtful to have Guinness present him that award. That mans earned it.
Pause at 11:37 chili's reaction 💀😂
So happy for him ❤
man owns a whole pepper farm but no toothbrush
"Why" is the correct question.
So all of you have to wear diapers for life right?
One heck of a video. I need to start trying peppers Ed makes it look fun
Holy cow, pure capseicin scores 16,000,000 on the scoville scale. Those peppers must be dribbling oil!
Pure dedication.
This stuff is good. The heat is nice, not as bad as I had anticipated but it's so good and the heat is perfect. Great flavor.
Beautiful moment. Congrats guys! !
That pepper looks gnarly af. Lol by looks alone it's sinister
That's going to burn so much more coming out
First we feast…….then we die………
Wonder if anyone will take inspiration from The Simpsons and call the next hottest pepper (if such a thing is possible) Merciless Insanity?
2.69 million. Of course.
Him dead😢
Hahahaha Nice Job 🥵
They need to change the name. Pepper x makes me think of Elon and he's icky
Amazing ❤
Nuh uh... the pepper itself looks evil...  😂😂
Congrats. Waiting for the seeds
You guys are 🤪
It's wild to see Ed visibly reacting!
That was GREAT…. 😅😅 can’t wait to try it.   Ed you are insane but we love you.
This is a moment in world history equal in importance to the first successful working atomic bomb
The pepper X sauce needs to have "I'm in heat" somewhere on the label 😂
Please add “I’m in Heat” at the end of all your videos like a production tagline. That would be amazing
Is that guy dying???😢😢😢
Please make a hot ones. I'm in heat t-shirt. Please please please please please please
Shane you know you should have ate that whole thang ! 😂
id eat 10 in a row no problem
Mr Hot Ones can't even eat a full pepper....Weak
why?
Ed got that "so preoccupied with if I could do, I never stopped to think if I should do it" mentality. What a goober.
Pencil!? Really, i think more the brain shut down and is unable to coordinate the proper word.
Congratulations ed
-congrats
Currie is a monster. I wonder how often he must eat incredibly hot peppers like this to eat a whole one of these things and just be standing there like he's not even moved by it. I ate a whole habanero one time and I will NEVER eat anything hotter than that. It was incredibly intense for me. This guy eats habaneros to COOL his mouth.
I AM KLAUS
Hold on..the two  guys not even flinching, like they just ate nothing??whoooaaa
quiero probarlo con helado de chocolate natural....  😁
Why?! Best comment
Looks gnarly...
“I’m in heat” 😂😂😂
Intelligence organizations taking note.  Good bye waterboarding, hello Pepper X
Eds kind of a chad
You boys are crazy lol. Good vid
😂
Great one guys, and congratulation to Ed Currie and his team.
As soon as I see my fellow dane I click!
We need Johnny Scoville on this show
I don’t believe in Santa Claus. All I need is Chili Klaus!
fake AF
“The pencil is really coming through”😂
Bro only ate and sliver but he can act perfectly fine with his hot sauces take a FULL PEPPER
u could've dropped the danish bs dude, his socalled "spicy habanero" sausage total rip off
Im sweating just watching this 🔥
Poor Klaus I wanna give him a hug lol 😂
Chili: Did you invent that pepper? Ed: yeahh  Chili: wHy?? 😂😂😂
I ordered a bottle of the new Last Dab Xperience It just tastes like the throw-back Dave's Insanity :(
I have to give it up to the Maker of pepper x. He described it perfectly exactly.  Edit : and congratulations. Is not easy to make something to hold a world record. It is something to be proud of
OH MY GOD!! i am in pain watching them.😢👍 Better them than me.😂 Question, can this be dangerous to people?
dude didnt even flinch
The guy who invented it barely blinked
They should have invited David Blane.
Congratulations! This was what I've been waiting for
Claus - "Did, did you invent that pepper?"  Ed - "yeah" Claus - "why?"    This had me dead!! 😂😂
Did Ed even eat the pepper??? 😳 he’s so calm
Ed almost cries for the record.... eats his own pepper and looks like he has forgot to turn off the coffeemaker at home while everyone around him is dying.
For a guy that is simply known for his hot peppers to still be humbled by receiving the distinction of the hottest pepper (and it not even being the first) shows what a class act Ed truly is.  Congrats to all the team and of course to Smokin' Ed!
Gotta love Chili Klaus
Oh, all the secrecy so no one steals anything like Ed did with a whole bunch of other phenomes that he claims as his own? Gee, I wonder why he would be so scared...
What is never mentioned or discussed, but I am 100% sure is on most people's mind, is how long these guys spend on the toilet the next few days.
Smokin’ Ed was not fazed at all 😂
the other 2 guys are so used to it.
Chili klaus, a man who has the same tolerance to spicy things as everyone else, but chose to put Chili in front of his name
There must more intense peppers in Ed's cupboard judging by his reaction.
"I'm in heat!"  ♥🤣
i clicked faster than ever before when i saw this gem in my feed! lets go!
Congratulations, Ed! 🌶️❤️🌶️ @7:06 !!!
✌️😁😁😁❤
need to invent a pepper that can remove those smoke stains on them teeth
Episode X Breaking Klaus
We can't forget he only released this pepper because no one else was competing he has to have something to best someone else
I found you through the Washington Post.  Quite interesting.
Yeah, you can really feel the pencil coming through 😅😅😅😅
Pepper X is hot! I received a free bottle of the classic and without realizing I had a nice amount and it was the pepper x edition!  But man is it good! 😂
Smokin Ed just seems like such a good guy, happy for him.
Can you test my theory that pure lard in the mouth will neutralize the release of capsaicin in your mouth.
There’s something beautiful and poetic that Ed chokes up being presented with the Guinness world record, and not from eating his insane peppers.  Huge congratulations Ed. You continue to push the boundaries, proving others wrong.
Got 2 bottles of it, fricken delicious
I'm so disappointed sean didn't eat a whole one, he should have at least done half
Congratulations to Smokin’ Ed. It was a joy to see him with Sean AND Chili Klaus (his first appearance back on the show since the season 4 finale) and the trio tasting it together 🔥  Next time Sean has Gordon Ramsay on Hot Ones, the multi-Michelin Star chef should be served Pepper X. Gordon would be unleashing the full wrath of his sailor mouth like there’s no tomorrow
It really must have some "poke"😂
Sheesh! Ed looks like he could go for another! 😂
And his humbleness is worldclass much respect to you ed
Ed's emotion when talking about how it took a team was genuine and from the heart you have appreciate and respect that I love hot things I have beat alot of hot challenges it's not easy can't wait to try pepper x congratulations Ed u deserve it respectfully 💯
did you invent this pepper ed? yes :chili clauss why? 😂😂
Growing up in the 90s was like Dragon Ball Z. Power levels growing like scollville levels.  The Habanero was king. Now its a Yamcha compared to the peppers of this day
Chili Klaus was hallucinating 😂😂
😂 that was the best watch I've seen in ages. Haha
Not to take away from the achievement, but Guinness World Records is a scam, many other YouTubers have discussed this.
Nope.
It's too bad that COVID killed my ability to handle spicy foods, because having a fellow South Carolinian win a record like this on my birthday is a real treat. Congrats, Ed!
Chili Klaus: "Did you do that? Did you invent that pepper?" Ed Currie: "Yes." Chili Klaus, in massive pain: "... why?" 🤣
Klause: “I’m.. (hiccup) in (hiccup) I’m in heat!”  Ed: “Oh no.. Klause is breeding”.  😂😂😂😂
Congratulations to Ed. And don’t forget to add Mark Weins to the challenge for  Pepper X.
Love me some Chili Klaus!
I'm in heat 🤣🤣🤣
Love to see Ed finally releasing this, and enjoying the fruits of his labor. He's a great guy.
👏👏👏Congrats Edd👏👏👏
Im just curious. Is this hotter than a chocolate primotali?
I love their smokin racha but they make tons of great sauces.  Also watching everyone but Ed die is hilarious
Lets get jonny Scoville to eat one
Haha. The amount of money one has to put up to Guinness to get a World Record is dumb.
It is a strange phenomenon. It's like women who get beaten up by their boyfriends but keep coming back.
Ed is the mad scientist of the scoville universe and I respect his efforts.
I cant wait to see Johnny Scoville take this this on!👌
They should’ve called the pepper, “The Hades Pepper!”.  Congrats to Ed, Noah and Hot One team for eating it. Pepper gods in one room. ❤
I’m glad he finally to it to get rated
Yeesh it’s gonna hurt coming out😟 is there anything else that can beat pepper X
Why? I'm with Chili Klaus on this one - a pepper this hot has no value other than to induce agonizing, gut-wrenching pain, so I don't see the purpose in something most wouldn't consider food.  I suppose watching someone else participating in self-induced agony is entertaining - and great content - but I can't imagine why anyone else, with any sense, would put themselves through that much torture?
Huh
I love Chilli Klouse
When somebody ask Ed who he is I'm hoping he replies  Explorers in the further regions of experience. Demons to some. Angels to others.
Ed had more tears for the record than from eating the pepper itself. He is made out of something else.
Currie looks like he's eaten a cherry
Ed literally wants to see the world burn.
The slow chaos that unfolded on Chili and Sean's side of the table made this so fun to watch.
Chili klaus joins the show to say "its very spicy" and "i'm in heat"
It’s official, Chili Klaus is a cool cat…or hot cat.
Gone be worse when it comes out the other side ^^
Pretty sure "Weapon X" is a more apt name - congratulations!
why did sean only eat a sliver of the pepper but make klaus ate a hole one?
Congrats Ed and all invovled. And seeing Ed just standing there while the world burns😅😅😅😅
I love that ending did you invent this? Why?
Why???????
with notes of... pencil
Can we get Jaime Oliver next
Huge (... and that's an understatement) respect to Chili Klaus and congratulations the Ed Currie and his team!
I love how passionate and genuine Ed Currie always is. ❤
@10:36 if you want to skip the filler and see them eat the pepper
I feel like Ed is literally the saw puppet dude.
hahaha this was cool and funny to watch
so watching Johnny Scoville eat this may or may not punch it in to my thick skull. Just how unnessessary this pepper is. Johnny is the measure stick
would love to see the full 2 hour journey back to normalcy
Klaus: 😖"I think there's oak in it" 😭 "and pencil!"   Sean: 😢🫳 "yeah! pencil really coming through"  Ed: 🤓
You guys are too crazy 😮
Ed sitting there smiling after eating that. Klaus is over there in heat lol.
Politicians should have to eat Pepper X every time they've been caught in a lie. After just a few days, no politicians would ever lie again!
The more I see Sean Evans the more I think he is inmortal
Can he taste jalapenos
…Not judging anyone but repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. The Lord Jesus died and was resurrected on the third day for us so that we might have eternal life through believing in him and obedience to him and the word. Accept the lord Jesus as your savior today if you haven’t already have a blessed day. The lord Jesus is coming back soon be ready 💜💜 ✝️✝️✝️🧡🧡🧡💙💙❤❤❤❤🧡🧡🧡🧡❤❤❤
Not sure how "taste" is a factor on these super hot peppers
The broken why sent me 😂😂😂
😂 Taylor swift.. shake it off.. Ed you funnyman
I'd never considered a Mount Rushmore of chilli. But yeah, this is it.
There's a reason why the bell pepper exists. 0 Scoville units.
PURVEYORS OF HEAT
Klaus is a legend ❤️🇩🇰  My late Uncle lacked the receptors to feel spicy food, he could have eaten these like popcorn.. but his stomach would punish him later that day 😅
Ed is just one of those instantly likable guys.  Even if you dont like super spicy food,  you cant help but root for this guy.
As someone who cannot eat anything hotter than a _pepperoncini_ (ie- Friarelli peppers...you know, those ones that are SO *not* spicy), I am equally fascinated and horrified at this.  Hats off to you gents...you truly are "Men of Steel"
Pepper X isnt too bad of a price either think ill buy a bottle ive eaten up to 1.5 million scoville without much problem curious as to how this will go. Of course I will be using it very sparingly and have milk on hand.
Imagine claiming that something that hot has taste. Out of all the things they could have been, they decided to breed peppers😂?
So funny!! I would seriously be more afraid of the “fire hole” later if you know what I mean.
I LOVE YOU GUYS!!!!
Hahaha “I’m in heat….” Is the best quote, y’all should make it a t-shirt with Klaus’ face on it
So great to see just how appreciative and valued he felt when Guinness validated his record. So great of y’all to set this up and so glad to see his dream come true
Man when Ed chocked up I felt it… 10 years of testing and R&D… well deserved, really, really big achievement guys!
Ed built like he puts the peppers on cheeseburgers
My hemorrhoids are screaming 😱 😭 😂
You know a pepper is hot when it makes the likes of Sean Evans and Chili Klaus cry. And yet, Ed just eats it like nothing. He must be part bird or something. :O
Lol shaun so high on pepper at the end 😂
I was afraid somebody might die in this episode. Holy falujah that looked hot.
Dudes teeth look like them peppers lol
Klause and Sean need to have an ice cream date where they just enjoy each other’s company without hot peppers.
If one of them doesn’t make an “I’m in heat” T-shirt it’ll be evidence that these things can cause brain damage 😭
Ed is such a G man
Amazing Episode 😮❤
Nerd alert. I think Scovilles are on a linear scale.
The bloke that's grew it is an animal ĺol
Ed’s passion for what he does really shines through when he was accepting that award. It’s refreshing to see someone that’s honest and hardworking and loving what they do
Hats off to these guys knowing what was coming. I grow Carolina Reapers and would never again eat a whole one. Pepper X scares me. They are great peppers to mix with others for my sauces. Can you do a show on how you make your hot sauce?
Klaus is breeding
We will sign thee contracts fly out too you.
Dude get Ed cury too send johnny scoville of chase thee heat a pepper x  right now I need Ed curry find best pepper x too send johnny scoville I will personally send you stuff that you guys really want I will come out thee vault for you.
We need the Extended Cut of Chili Klaus. Love this man. ❤
Could they potentially breed Pepper X with a Carolina Reaper to make an even hotter one ? call it Pepper Z then retire as the GOAT of the Pepper World.
When you think Sean is a pro at handling spicy and then you see the Ed all composed after eating Pepper X while Sean is dying. You realise there really are levels to this 😂
“I’m in Heat…” ❤❤❤❤❤
I just want somone who is as proud of me as Ed is of his peppers.
Pencil !!!!!
chili klaus is so awesome
I made a mistake with some homemade chili a few weeks back. I only had 4 peppers 🌶️ left. I was sure it wouldn’t be able to add that much heat.  BOY WAS I WRONG!!! I was so freaking hot, nobody could eat it including me. I pitched it instead of wasting more food trying to save it.  Lessons learned the hard way.
14:08 😂
Ed is a beast!🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bless him you can see how much the record meant. Good for u playa
Those peppers even looks pure evil. Congratulations to Ed on the plaque. It´s still kindda wierd to see a fellow Dane being so well know in the area of such a well known thing as chilis
The skin on my face feels tighter...🤣🤣🤣
The delivery on Klaus asking "why" absolutely killed me
I can’t wait to try this pepper! I use reapers in a lot of things and this flavor sounds amazing.
While farmers thrived during President Trump's administration, they are subjected to be robbed under Sleepy Biden's rule. What a shame!!
Chiliiiiiii Klauuuuuus!
It's a pity Ed Currie won't release Pepper X except as a hot sauce.
Congrats to that framer.
2023 and we’re all pepper geeks. This I did not see coming.
Chill Claus: “ I’m in heed” Sean: “heaven?!”  😂🤣😂🤣😅🤣😂🤣
This is the most white men video ever
O mundo inteiro ja quer experimentar essa berração.
Ed’s reaction to eating one tells you he’s 100% eaten something hotter 😳
Such dedication, love. Amazing.
looks like Pepper X is even hotter than Klaus´ Skandinavian Cousins :D
"did you do that? Did you invent that peppah? WHY?" 😂😂😂😂
You can literally hear Sean’s voice waver when they bring the peppers out
I don't understand why people eat this stuff. Is because they're masochists? Lol
Man i want some seeds. Just for growing it at home...i really wish him success and he deserves his money...but at least release them sometimes
Ed thinking "Oops! I suppose I should have offered them some of the antidote first? Ah well, too late now." 😂
Wow so much regret😭😂
congratulations
Dear sean, have you ever thought about inviting mark wiens, he's an fulltime eater but most of all he eats everything with so much peper. Would love to see him eat your peper x saus.   Love your show. Kind regards Angéla
👽 thanks for Pepper X ❤
Ed, you're an animal!
He has the fitness gram pacer test voice
Nobody talks about it coming out the other end when you poo. What is that like? or do you have diarrhea for days?
Congrats smokin ed! Keep it Up 👍🏻
The fact that Ed has no reaction proves: A) he's a robot,, B) he's a psychopath or C)he's a robot psycholopath
Ok well i better get prepared for next chilli eating comp...
And Ed has already gone on record that he is already confident that he hasn't come close to what he can create.  That is frightening.
“Did you invent that pepper?” “Yeah!” “Why?”  😂
y’all are crazy. 👀🤦🏻
I adore Chili Klaus, I don't know why, but it so much fun to watch him with Sean.
This warmed my heart as much as Pepper X warmed everyone in this video! Congrats, Ed! <3
Shake shake it off, perfect
How does ed just not react at all😂😂
Noah Chaimberg is like if Ian from Smosh took a vastly different path
Well deserved Ed. 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼❤❤
Why
Chocolate primotalii and the Louisiana creeper were wayyy hotter then the reaper (previous guinnes worlds hottest). Can’t wait for Johnny Scoville to test this.
I ate a reaper on a dare at work a few years back, after 15 minutes, I felt compelled to go and hang out in the bathroom “ just in case something terrible happened”, During this time, I sweat through my uniform. Once the pain subsided, I actually felt great for a good hour or two.  Needless to say, I won’t be doing that again.
Psychopaths !!! All of you!!
Cool, but... according to puckerbutt's website they won't sell seeds of this pepper. After years of hype this is turning into a big disappointment. Nobody will be able to eat these peppers fresh. Now it may be the hottest but if I can't have it why would I even care?
thanks to everyone and their bholes for this one!
You went Pepper X . Dude...
How about pepper X because simply they have been hiding it for 10 years...  You know Roman numerals.
I tried a Carolina Reaper Pepper...Just ¹/⁸ " of an Inch I felt not heat in both my ears....But pain!!
I love Klaus
I love chili klaus!
I legit believe a pepper this hot should be classified as poison
Looks fun
Crazy people 🔥
Joy.  Thank you.
I think Ed is some kind of a big bird
"I'm in heat"
Brutal
aint the reaper floral fruity nah just taste like heat, think the pepper x will taste like the sun
YES!!!!! Chilli Klaus is back baby!!!!! 🎉🎉🎉
"Pencil"  LOLOL
That’s messed up. I read it hurts for 3 hours. Lol.
❤❤❤what a great episode! liked it a lot as it was very touching and informative.
Super stoked about trying the pepper, I had a sauce with this pepper that I bought from their shop a few months ago. I really like and appreciate Ed and Noah, they seem like awesome dudes, and I like the content here, but I'm so sick of Sean lol
I watched people in the pepper game doubt the existence of pepper x for years. I’m glad to see it win the record. Can’t wait to get my hands on some seeds.
Huge congrats, Ed! 🎉
Wow that was great so that’s the new wing 10?
Wait for the toilet time😂
“I’m in heat” It’s literally all he can say.
"Im in heattt" had me dead 💀🤣
He should put his skills into cannabis
So when are we getting the chili Klaus “I am in heat“ shirts? Because I’ll totally buy one.
This is hilarious 😂 Claus my man!
Having tried the hot sauce Klaus saying, "I'm in heat. I'm in heat." truly explains EXACTLY what that felt like 😂
I want to try it but like with food, I hope the flavor is as powerful as it is brutally spicy
Why? Those hot peppers have no taste, it’s all just heat.
Ed has been robbed blind for a decade. Over 300 products have used Ghost Pepper and Carolina Reaper with zero royalty for Ed
Is it 2.69 million or 3.4 million Scoville units, I have read both.
why is the name reserved
the peppers been around for 6 years
Poor Chili Klaus, I've never seen his so beaten.
This was an instant classic. The ending was also great 😂😂
Ooh man
11:10 Chili Santa starts going into heat.
It even looks mean...
Whats the point? From a culinary standpoint, this is useless bullsh!t. Pain isn't tasty. Anything, that eliminates the actual flavor and makes you wanna eject the food, is just nonsense. I don't get why people do that.
I AM IN HEAT 🤣🤣🤣 . Why 🤣🤣🤣
😈 Ed Currie is the devil incarnate!
I know and you know and Ed's knows he has a pepper at least 10x hotter than pepper x
I was so surprised how tasty Carolina Reaper is. Hope PepperX tastes just as good.  Btw: Why didnt Sean eat a complete one?
Love to see Chili Klaus back on set with Sean🔥
A young Taylor Swift 😂😂
Rhett and Link come out of retirement for charity
Just saying, Being danish, watching Klaus's first video a long time a go, being in NYC 2016 just random going by a small store in Williamsburg selling hot sauce, talking to such a cool down to earth person behind the counter, to years later stumbling upon Hot Ones and first then realising the connection - to watching this video. It really warms my heart u guys! ❤❤❤❤
Klaus is toothles
🥵🤯
Some people just want to see the world burn...
I don't understand the point in making something too hot to eat
Wait til it comes out the back end. Lol!!😅
would love to eat a pickled pepper X. maybe in small quantities at a time though!.
Congratulations Ed. Poor Klaus 😆 I'm going to order some of these for the guy stealing my food.
I really want to see Devid Blain eat this Pepper X.
Nothing more entertaining than watching grown men torture themselves!
I would like to point out that all peppers in the world are native to the Americas. So this should be a national pastime for every country in the Americas. ❤
I feel like Ed doesnt feel the burning and he wants to make the hottest pepper ever to feel something
I want to buy 1 Pepper X please
Holy Moly. I get heartburn eating a bowl of cereal.😊😊
it has been a journey. nice to see some old friends and newer ones coming together for this video! congrats on getting the record.
You have to love Ed, what a cool guy. I would be great to sit and have beers and peppers with him and hang out... maybe not HIS peppers, probably some habaneros or bonnets, they're more my speed.
congratz to ed and his team of genius pepper lovers for creating a great new pepper and other way to voluntary  torture myself with and maybe challenge my friends with :)
I really need like. 10-15 minute post credit to see how rheyre doing
World record but the world can't get it to find out? Release the pods!!! 😂
Sean lurched back when the heat kicked in lol burn baby burn
The real challenge is later when its on its way out 🤣
Put the babywipes in the freezer
Chilli Claus is back!
Chili Klaus would now be able to Extrakt seeds from his "going number 2", because he ate a whole Pepper X! So if there are seeds available one day, not from Ed...we know who did it! 😂
Where's the spice king....oh yea no one cares
It's great to see Ed literally get his flowers. Beautiful.
Does ed have any taste buds left lol
I was just thinking the peppers currently available aren't nearly hot enough
I needed introduction
It's like a new album just dropped!
Deep down, there is a very sadistic part of me that would like to try it, but stacked on top  of that desire, is many MANY levels of sanity that will forever keep me from knowing what it feels like.
Chili out here having the best reaction you’d want to see
Pepper X....more like Weapon X lol I know it's taken but you get it lol
Watch out this is a Con job
Ed talking about how he feels about people eating the Apollo… haha that diabolical smile
Congratulations. I'd probably be on the ground screaming like a little girl trying to scrape it off my tongue with the carpet ... But i still would try ;)
We need more people like Ed!❤❤
Such a wonderful moment to share with everyone. Go Ed & team!
The amount of money he has made from all the chilli's he has sold you think he would of gone to a dentist!!
Congrats on the pepper 🌶
I wonder how much money Ed is going to make off of government contracts for crowd control weapons
Ed "there's really no throat burn, but that comes on later when you're in pain" says with a straight face 😂
I hope chillis stomach is okay after that dang
Idk these guys but to the dude who said he was excited for this pepper to take off, congrats to you man.  I dont even eat peppers, but if you're happy about it then im for it. 👌
YES YES YES!! Finally !!!
Man I just love this episode so much
I feel like Chili Klaus while eating a Red Savina, I can't begin to imagine what it could feel like eating a Pepper X...
the pepper guy is so sadistic...love it !
When Chili Klaus is out, do not  touch it. Great job and congrats, Ed!
I only hope and pray someday that we get to grow these peppers to…if you can ever figure out a way to get all the dollars from the seed sales…I will gladly pay you for them Ed…just saying.
You see Ed has the secret. He done this for so long with many types that he turns thats pain and heat into a high.
Dude, Ed's dark brah
"I'm in heat" HAHA had me rollin. congrats on the world record
Awesome
Scoville scale is based on units of sugar water not just regular water
ATG's A Pepper Z will soon pass Pepper X Edd, you should be more concern about your health. Please take care of your self & do some exercises for starter
Pepper X creator made me tear up. His passion is felt. Congrats! 🌶️
I was hoping to see chili Klaus snaps and I was not disappointed 😂 can't wait to try this stuff
When will you invite Johnny Scolville on this show?
🤣🤣🤣
Klaus was the true star of this episode😂
Klaus is my new favorite guy 🤣😂🤣💀
Man that pepper looks beautiful and terrifying at the same time. Impressive!
beware of corporate takeovers
heat creates bitterness
The fact ed, immediately mentions the team behind the achievement speaks how humble and passionate he is in the craft that they do.
Yeah nah
Sean only ate a sliver and he got fried imagine Klaus and Ed ate a whole pod OUUUUUCH!!!
They stole the chilli and made it mutant from North East India( bhoot jalokia) , but congrats to Ed, for winning the Guinness world record. Now, I from north east india from the state of Manipur will make sure we BEAT this record!
The spicy squad 🫑😂 Klaus is always entertaining and the science that Ed and Puck team are doing is taking our senses up a notch🥇
scoville scale ist not logarithmic
What a perfect episode to see ♥️
This is hysterical , These guys  are dying and the inventor is just chugging along
I just noticed sean and klaus are conditioning themselves to hate each other.  Everytime they see each other its just connected to pain.
Congrats Ed on making a sauce the light the @$$es on 🔥 coming out 😂😂😂😊
Great performance guys. No way I am going to try these Pepper X.
Ed seems so grateful, that's wonderful 😊
10 seconds after eating = two in pain and the others happy   lol
LOL...  "Did you do that? Did you invent that pepper?"  "Yeah..."  "WhyYyyYyeee?!"  ahahahaha
Being Danish, watching Chilli Klaus (also Danish...) is a treat 👍. He us usually rather calm and collected when eating hot peppers - but he looses it here, forgetting what being "in heat" means in English...😂😂😂.
I’m super happy for Ed, he seems like a really good guy. Guiness world records are known as a total sham these days tho.
Why did he create it?  Because he could.
Pure Gold! A modern day group of mad scientist testing their own super human serum on themselves! Evans,  Klaus and Currie have dominated a full factor of the human experience that is "taste"! These people deserve the whole culinary world to join in on their exploration! Humanity deserves this new evolution of flavor experience!
Those two dudes deserve another Guinness award for being unphased while chewing on the world's hottest pepper 🥵
Good work!!
Pepper X formally known as TwitTwatTang pepper.🌶️
Thumbnail looks like you’re eating baby monkey heads.
IT was that HOT Chilli Klaus couldn't do his clicking nor his ears properly
I'm having to watch this with nitrile gloves and safety glasses.
I want to try it.
Let Johnny Scoville from @chasetheheat try Pepper X!  Are you worried he won't be impressed?
Even a "handshake" With Ed is enough to give you a third degree burn.
Bring it to India, let's see 😁👍🏻
You can tell how much this world and his team mean to the guy. What a genuine man. 😊
Made the hottest pepper and isn't going to share it. Selfish
ED Peppers 🌶️
Never thought I'd see The Chili Klaus have to tap out. That's extreme.
Well done ED!!!
Did the peppers do that to Ed's teeth, or is he from Britain?
Sean and Noah not taking the whole pepper???.... Oof lame.
when he got emotional over receiving the guinness world record I almost lost it  It's a fckn pepper, not a space shuttle 😂
Congrats Smokin' Ed and crew for holding the record and bringing the heat!
Congratulations Ed, very well deserved, as much as I love this show and push myself to try hotter and hotter sauces I don’t think I’m man enough to try pepper X
What's he mean by stabilizing a pepper?
“Oh no, Klaus is breeding” killed me 😂😂😂
Afterburner without the Jet? Endpoint Skin and muscle graft? Colonoscopy alternative?  Laparotomy ? Shadow Intestines controlled by AI? Influenza cure?😂🤣
Ed doesn't count cuz his taste buds are permanently damaged
"Did you invent that pepper?" "Yeah." "...why"  😂
My eyes would start watering just being in that room. I like heat but not like that
Ed is just there chilling after eating that Pepper X lol.
I just love the fact that the guy who makes the world’s hottest peppers is called Mr Currie.
Best line: CK - Did you invent that pepper?   Ed - Yes   CK - WHY? 🤣
14:08 🤣🙌 Glorious
Ed's just chillin' at the end
Claus : "Did you create this?" Ed: "Yes" Claus: "Why????"  Best lines
Tell the people what it cost to have Mr. Glass present that award. It's alot like winning the Grand Prize Game.
Anyone who adds distillate to hot sauce is not worried about the wholeness of the sauce. They chemically extract the hot stuff from the pepper and then claim its full of natural flavors.
If im ever on this show im bringing 20 chili toreadors one for me and one for the host
We really need a post pepper review from Klaus.  I’d really like to hear his thoughts after it’s all over.
I had the pepper called paprika once. I actually didn't think it was that very hot. I could eat it in a salad without drinking milk. My eyes got a bit runny, but that was it. Very nice flavour. I am gonna buy some of these x peppers and try them. I bet they are not as spicy as they say in the video. I am usually quite good when it comes to spicy food. I can even handle grounded black pepper if it's in a sause or something.
I love Chili Klaus so much ❤❤
Not enough money in the world!!
I started sweating.. as soon as they all ate it 😳
I'm in love with Smokin Ed Currie
no one is talking about how Ed completely tanked that pepper
Zero charisma
Old guys being idiots
That is one uggo pepper.
I would have called it Nurgle's hemorrhoid.
that pepper just looks evil!
He looks just like Taylor Swift and aounds just like the "There's a Visine for that" guy lol. So happy for him! Cant wait to try the sauce.
I think there's some oak in it....... And.............. Pencil
I think buffalo wild wings barbecue wings get hot id die if i tried it
They finally made the closest thing to Chemical X from powerpuff girls
Klaus is such a G, love to see this dude. What a savage
My bottle just showed up.  We're doing it at work on Sunday...
Sean come on now, you can’t just eat a slice, we have to see you eat the whole pepper at least once
i want to eat that pepper
“I’m in heat”
At some point Sean, you guys/gals need to have like a Tournament of Champions, but obvs call it something better. Like All Stars, or something, and have people who have been the best of the best so far, and have them do a murderers row of the hottest of the sauces over the years.  But have this be the only time you exclude Da Bomb.  I would substitute it for WDS if it's still around.
Congratulations!!!!!
At the end of the video " I'm in heat " got me
Nice 😂
What was the original name for Pepper X?
Honestly never understood why ppl want these kind of things
The fact that they ate A WHOLE F——ING pepper!!!   “‘’ COOOOOOMMMOOOON”””
“I’m in heat.” 🤣🤣🤣
Could you die eating one?
The Carolina Reaper as far as flavor is amazing and addictive on many items. I really hope pepper x tastes just as good or better!
Don't eat this when you're asthmatic and it's not completely controlled. Inhaling it will likely trigger an attack.
Pepper X sounds like it could make uranium cry.
Seems like a pretty good guy.  Good for him and his team.
You guys are all insane. 😂😂😂
My Xperience is on the way!  Can't wait to try it!  Thank you Ed, Sean, and Noah!!  Oh, and you too Klaus for showing us just how diabolically (and possibly dangerously) hot this thing is!
Why hurt yourself? 🤨
Lol I’m sorry but I just don’t see the point or why anyone would even want to do this
14:08
Human being hurting themselves and enjoying it! Lol😂😂. 2 are suffering and 2 are just zen like Buddhists monks !
Mad respect to everyone here
Did you do that, did you invent that pepper? Yes, why….😂😂😂
I have only known 2 people to eat peppers like Ed. I had a friend whos dad was from Mexico and he could eat Pequin by the handful like they were nuts. I thought they WERE nuts. I was mistaken. I had another friend who could chew up anything you gave him and never break a sweat, found out he had no sense of smell.
This was Great!
IM SO HAPPY FOR ED!!!!
I feel like the next step from here, is to create an extinguisher product, that is the best product to counteract the effects of a hot pepper, perhaps on a reverse-scoville that deducts from the total down to a lower scoville, when taken together..
Dude that pepper looks angry
Seeing Ed choke up broke me. He's such a great human being
Chili Klaus is a legend
Waiting for the one chip challenge with pepper x
Sean what happened?
Did you invent that pepah? Yes  Why??
Video starts @9:40
Seeing Sean Evans on the other side of the gun amazes me😂😂😂😂😂
Man when smokin Ed started to tear up I couldn’t help but tear up with him 🥲
Why on earth would you eat that?
Based on this video, Ed 100% has a nuclear bunker and a supply of everything needed to dominate the apocalypse
"I'm in heat" 😂
You guys need to get CM Punk on the show!
I wanna try the peppers 😢
Ed is a straight G!!! He stands there like he had a jalapeño 😅
I wish i could buy the seeds man.
I’m getting the impression that Ed used to be very heavy and lost a lot of weight due to capsaicin tolerance.
Chili Klaus: Did you do that..... did you invent that pepper?  Smokin Ed Curry: Yeah!!!!  Chili Klaus: Why........  💀😂
Meanwhile X man chewing it like it was a gummy bear. 😂😂
Any vid with chili klaus is instant watch! Congrats Ed!
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 ❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤
The new world? Which one is that? First we feast needs a lesson on grammar
Also wasn't pepper X 3.1m?
Get rid of Noag,he’s a capitalist pig.
"why?" Lol.
Congratulations to Ed Currie! If I find them on HERE on Irish shores, I'm trying them RAW!
Ed must've been struck with the deadly venomous bite of the mythoillogical pepper snake.
Ed's reaction or lack thereof is amazing.
yes, more klaus.
І саме на цьому моменті я зрозумів,що більше відео з цими людьми я більше не побачу… R.I.P. 😂😂😂
I need to try that pepper!
A lot of people compare it to a what?? @2:40 can the paragraph guy please explain😬
Ну на цьому моменті я поняв що люди на цій планеті не помруть своєю смертю 🤣🤣🤣
Very spicy D
Eds got some real milkers
I feel like the implication is that Ed has something hotter he is saving for when the world is ready
they look like they took payote
Monster X
I ate a Carolina reaper with ed at PDX hot sauce expo 2023!
11:39  Klaus is just so happy to be here 😭
Ed is not human
Those guys swallowed them Ed just mashing it up in his mouth and says “even though I don’t look it” 😂
The most incredible part of all of this is that there is no burn. Nothing. No chemical reaction is happening. No damage is occurring to tissue. Only the capsaicin binding to your nerve receptors. All of this is in their minds.
Ed's pretty chill, and you can tell, that moment at 7:10 - he does this for the true love of it. Mad respect Ed!
Chilli Klaus is hilarious 😂
lies
Dude needs to bleach his teeth.
🗣️ "Im in ..HEET" 🗣️
"I'm in heat" -Chili Klaus
I don’t know about you but as far as I’m concerned, Ed eat an apple. 💀
When you make Chili Klaus question life you've done well.
🥵😭I think there's... some ... oak in it... 😭🥵
Don't watch the Hollywood make-believe stuff. That's trash. This is what peak human progress actually look like. We will look back in 100 years and be genuinely proud of this.
Smoking Ed Currie is both the sweetest, and spiciest man on the planet. What a gem!
"I'm in heath."
Respectfully, I don't think Ed understands logarithmic scales.  The Scoville scale is, in fact, linear and the perception of hotness is logarithmic.  So Pepper X won't taste 3x as hot as the Carolina Reaper.  It will taste hotter, but not as hot as the Scoville rating difference would suggest.
i feel like he has hotter peppers in his vault hes just holding on to them untill pepper x goes threw the motions then when it cools off BOOM tripple X reaper pepper 5 million
😭😭😭
Best lineup yet. Awesome and so funny.
I dont kniw whats funnier, the fact that Ed seems barely phased or Klaus saying "Im in heat"
Hahaha this is golden!!
Lucky, I wish I could try one :(
He worked so hard for this... congrats Ed !
What a great episode...that might be the last pepper Claus decides to eat
I love the intro.... did you invent this? Yes..... Why?
Aw man, seeing Ed getting emotional about this massive accomplishment is enough to bring a tear to my eye. What a cool moment.
congrats to Ed and the whole team  at puckerButt...It is so amazing, to see your passion and all the afford you put in this. Well deserved. Also, great Episode and great to see ChiliKlaus again...
poor people...
man who made this pepper is the absolute best kind of psychopath... hope he makes decent money off this for life...
I demand an extended version of this video! Every second is a gift!
gg
The smile on Ed's face....hahaha...is priceless! (11:21)
I cried with you Ed when you got the plaque! Wonderful moment
Man that denim Klaus was rocking was on point!!  Love Chili Klaus
Chili Klaus is the Chris Hansen of Chili. There is just something in his voice that makes you do what he tell you. "Oh should I eat this extremely painfull torture fruit that makes tough men cry in pain? Sure if you say so"  Ed is the kinda of guy that uses pebberspray to clear his sinuses
I love chili Klaus lol he makes the best reactions 😂
best
I love this show but not at all a fan of Ed Currie. Many of us will not believe pepper x is the hottest in the world until it's released to the world. Until then, it's a marketing ploy.  Prove us wrong Ed Currie.
Jesus h Christ
I'm sorry, but how does that guy not understand that it is SUGAR WATER that is used to measure the Scoville scale?  How can this guy be that clueless?
I think they really could’ve done better for a name then ‘X’. Ghost pepper, and Carolina reaper, those are great names! Anyway, big, congratulations to Ed! I know it’s a passion and we’re all happy for you. I love watching people eat these peppers. Have fun!
Such a joy that Puckerbutt keeps our little corner of the world on the map for something as cool as World’s Hottest Pepper! Congratulations to Ed and the whole team! I’m sure I’ll meet up with PepperX before too long.
Chili Klaus is the master, but Ed is the God when eating peppers! 😎👍✌🗽
Wow, i just realized a jalapeño is only around 4000 SHU, pepper x is redic
8:50 for dA boy Chilly Klaus
I love Klaus to Ed... did you invent that? Ed-yeah Klaus-WHY???? 😂
Claus literally had kittens 😂
Eds personality is fun.
Been a while since ive watched an episode... best one to restart.
Is that guy okay?? 😂😂
I wonder if ed uses pepper spray like binacca... 😂  fresh breath spray!
As someone with IBS and GERD, I’m almost positive eating one of these would put me in the hospital
I would genuinely be interested if a few people who taste peppers for a hobby got together, and separately ate the pepper, and put down the 'flavour', whether they would put similar things, or at that heat level, does your brain take control and just make up flavours? Congrats to Ed and his team, you can tell he is very proud of his achievement and I hope he continues with his love of peppers for many years to come. :))))))
Does i look like just Taylor Swift? 13:58
Ed sleeps in a gas chamber without issues.
We have have the first video recording of an extraterrestrial. We name them "Ed"
Says they need no introduction.  Proceeds to introduce them.  Smh
Smokin' Ed is an entirely different animal than the rest of us.
Legend Ed tearing up more from recognition than nuclear by-product.
“I’m in heat” 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
Of course i wamna try
Gotta be honest, Gen modified peppers should have their own category
WHEN YOU START HICKUPING THAT IS WHEN YOU KNOW.
I cry from eating peppers and from watching Ed get that Guinness plaque.
Wow that pepper looks like a dangerous toxin. It's screams leave me alone!
Dayum I want to try this pepper 🔥🔥
So what they were describing is basically a fiery brain “freeze” (blast).
My ears are ringing I’m laughing so hard
I'm in heat... 😂
Man... I could only imagine the ring of fire afterwards😂
Ed probably doesn't feel the same level of beat bc he eats the peppers so often, and you definitely get used to the heat, with each pepper you get more and more used to the heat. Might not be easy but but he's done it!
I’m really hoping Ed releases pepper x to the public. I heard he won’t though. No one will be able to eat the pod to see how hot it is.
Well.. if someone goes full emo and say's I just wanted to feel something, give them one of those peppers....
Congratulations Ed and your awesome team!! Your emotion showed just how much you've been through with this and how much it means to you! A sensory overload in all aspects! Now on to the next!! Bc i know you won't stop there!! You're probably already working on another even hotter, or a more flavorful Pepper X! Congrats again! Ya'll deserve it!!!
Ja når chilien bliver for stærk så bliver man nød til at ringe efter forstærkninger fra Danmark :D
Amazing
Chili goin thru it 🤣
Perfect gift for my sister, who loves eating spicy food 😂 and Christmas is just right around the corner, too.
Meh, who cares? If no one is allowed to eat the pepper, a "world record" means little. Congrats, pepper X is the hottest pepper no one is permitted to eat...  Looks like the Chocolate Primotalii will remain the hottest pepper available.
Chili klaus such a funny guy holy smokes. And congrats to ed for world record
How that man is able to be that calm is amazing!! I know wat heat like that can be like. It's torture😮
Is chilli klaus ok???
This is a video I know I'm going to watch a billion times.
4:02 “I like the way people look when they get really scared from eating my hot sauce 🤭”  Oh Ed 💀😂
Chili Klaus was ok at the end? that man looked like he was actually in bad shape.
I’m in heat is as good as it’s hotter than my cousin comment. 💀
It says a lot about Ed that he acknowledged his team immediately and sincerely when he was asked how HE felt about getting the record. Being the face of the company, it would have been so easy to just portray it as a moment of personal glory. We love Ed
🥲😜😝🤨🥵🥺😡 "It's very spicy... Tastes like... Pencil" 😭 - Chili Klaus 2023
Johnny scoville needs to try this
“Why?”
Ed teared up more receiving the award than he did eating the pepper x
FYI, Apollo in the Greek means destroyer
Skip to 10 mins to see them actually eat hot stuff lol
There is something about watching otherwise rational beings purposely subjecting themselves to highly irrational experiences.
Huge shout out to Ed for the record!!  I've never seen Ed before but was immediately impressed with his knowledge of his peppers and the pepper game. Dude seems super chill, if my inside's wouldn't melt I'd def eat a pepper with him; and everyone else in this video for that matter lol. Grazt to all 4 of these gents for surviving this pepper
tasting pepper ? no thank you i am ok
Too bad itll never be released to the public.....
I worked at an Indian restaurant, and we would use Carolina Reaper powder in our hottest curry. Wherever we would wash the container we kept it in, it would gas the entire back room and cause everyone's eyes to water and for you to have a strong cough.
He wont stop until someone quite literally dies from his pepper bombs.
13:50  “Did you invent that pepper? “ “ Yeah” “Why ?!” 😂
I appreciate the effort in growing these but I just couldn’t do it!  Great job guys!!!
When Hunter S. Thompson, Johnny Sins, Prince Harry and Ron Swanson have a Chilli Tasting standoff
This is awesome I gotta try this congrats Ed!
🍉
"Did you invent that pepper?" "Yes" "Why?"  Such a calm exchange, yet riddled with underlying pain, agony and emotion 😂
10:35 tasting starts
Those peppers x look genuinely evil
Sometimes its scary how hot a pepper can be
I had to rewind just to make sure Ed ate that pepper, jesus christ this guy did not even flinch… 😮
I am definitely drooling at 10:58 🔥🤤
Why was he crying about being the best at making a digestible poison? Yah!!! Your life’s work.
Ed is insane 😂
I see Chili Klaus, I click
d-did you do that? did you create that pepper? :0 yeah :D why? D:
Im sorry but when peppers get this  hot there is no flavor
This makes me wonder if he's got many other peppers even hotter than Pepper X  that he's just been holding onto. Man's likely got a treasure trove of ever-hotter peppers he's just waiting to release every few years.
"I'm in heat" LOL
think about it : Klaus and Sean are notorious chili heads, they eat peppers that would lead most of us to the ER (or to at least a terrifying case of explosive diarrhea), and then you have Ed, who barely seems to register the heat. that's both impressive and a little terrifying.
Do I look like Taylor swift? Lol
Ed almost breaking down crying when he was saying thank you for the World Record and thanking his team and supporters is so wholesome o7
Lil late to the game. This strain of pepper has been around for about 10 years now.  Had the chance to eat one in SC in 2013 and it was a game changer!
Ed looks human….. but he just cannot be.
Bruh when Ed said he likes when people get scared eating his hot sauce Sean was shaking his head with so much disapproval. He was looking like Ed's a war criminal describing his exploits. Just pure contempt at 4:00. Sean knows what Ed does for a living 🤣
I’m fascinated to know how much Sean’s tolerance of heat after so many episodes of Hot Ones softened the intensity. Imagine if he never did Hot Ones. He’d surely pass out?!
Bro ate that like a champ.
Ed is obviously a corpse! I get hiccups eating half a jalapeño.  Absolutely not.  A big ole bag of NOPE!
"Pencile" took me out 😂😂...  "Im in heat"  bahaha
Do I look just lime Taylor Swift 😭😂
The avengers have assembled
"I'm in heat......... I'm in heat ..........!"
Congratulations, Ed,well Deserved record 🤘
Pepper master is my dream job xD
Oh my that was so so funny.  I love Ed’s dead pan expressions and Klaus crying. Well done Ed.
The fear in Sean’s voice right before they eat the pepper…
The 'Shake it Off' T-Swift moment with Ed at the end was hilarious and so wholehearted! Nothing but goodness to this man, his team and their endeavors!🙌🏾
Wait till the exit 😂
You know it's a serious pepper when you see Chili Klaus actually tapping out. He's been able to talk during other challenges, but it's clear this one really overwhelmed him.
That’s right. Set your colon on fire.
Not that hot
Elon Musk's favourite Pepper
RIP Chilli Klaus...
Imagine sending your boy a pepper and he gets more famous while you just stay unknown😂
Ed is such an awesome guy:) much love to everyone on his team for the pepper, and everyone on Sean’s team for sharing this cool story with us!
KLAUS! KLAUS! KLAUS! KLAUS!
How ridiculous, and who said so? Guiness????  BS that’s like saying. Your mom says you are the best. Come on people! You guys haven’t explored a thousandth part of the world and you dare to make such a statement. You should go and try Chilli Piquín in Mexico and do not doubt there are also as or even spicier Chiles in Asia.
Love ed he’s got so much passion for what he does, great to see people doing what they love. massive congratulations to you sir
I see two different experience, seems its a drama
Lol Chile Klaus?? Really? What a Joke!.   Get Johnny Scovile to eat a plate full of these things!!!
Are you kidding me!? Chile Klause? Lol Jokers! that man has ZERO power. Stood up against the Goat, the Chaser of Heat, the great, Johnny Scovile he'd crumble. Get Johnny some of these Peppers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I’m kinda sweating and I’ve never even had a really really hot pepper before lol
Salvation is found in Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ loves you all
what legends
Love seeing the passion from people doing what they love and getting the validation they deserve.
Jesus
Ed Currie is a monster... ROFL.
With all respect for everyone involved..... "Officially from Guiness" means absolutely nothing. These guys hand out records as if they were candy.
"ohhh no Klaus is breeding" 😂😂
Ed Currie is a psychopath, but in the best way. I am morbidly curious, but also too intimidated to actively pursue a taste of Pepper X.
masochism
You guys are amazing for surprising Ed with the Guinness World Record!!! Definitely brought a smile to my face, right on!! 👏🏼
Jesus, he took down Chili Klaus. Literally broke him. "I'm in heat!, i'm in heat!!"  Meanwhile Ed just chilling there like hes got a mouth full of ice cream.
I suffer with IBS but still want one.
Love chili Klaus.
omfg, i'm crying with laughter here. Klaus is a gift we are not worthy of.
Hahaha when they’re all laughing together 😂🫶🏻 Seemed like they were high as kites on those peppers lol
Love to see Roger eat them I bet he wouldn't break a sweat 😅
Genuinely one of the most interesting videos I've seen in ages. Nice work.
Why
I'm salivating.
It looks like Ed is calmly commenting the process of dying of Sean and Klaus... :⁠-⁠D  But hey, they're all adults and do this to themselves voluntarily. ;⁠-⁠)
Ed is the GOD of Spicy
Ed seems like a great and nice guy ... But also looks like the Heisenberg of the pepper industry 😅
What's the ne of that hot sauce in the video ? I've checked the site but can't find it
why in the world would anyone want to do that to themselves. Congratulations Ed Currie for the spiciest chili in the world.
When you eat something hot, don't drink milk or yoghurt or ice cream. Just have a cucumber. Immediately it goes away much faster. To make it even more effective, dip it in mayo.
Chili Klaus is a riot 😂😂
Im currently at the second before they put the pepper into their mouths and I think this is insane. INSANE!
12:15 Ed making things so much worse in the calmest voice 😂
Dude making real life smile fruits out here
Ed’s passion is palpable. This man is a testament to what happens when you love something so deeply, with such determination. Congratulations Ed, the team and Hot Ones!
Limited edition Guinness World Records stamped bottles?
Sean's teeth look expensive
Ed is completely built
I love how he says "we" over and over again, not "I" or "me"
I’ve never seen a Danish guy say ‘pencil’ in such agony before. 😏
Can’t believe they got Taylor swift to do this video ❤❤
Been living in Europe for a few years and my heat tolerance is waaaaay down. Even Cholula has a kick haha...but watching these pros go into heat was awesome. I'd prbabaly start chasing horned chrubs around the studio.
Nope.
PuckerButt 🎉 great name
This MIGHT be the most wholesome video I've ever seen
Sean you're such a coward
Perhaps these peppers can be used by the scientists here in Western Australia, who are finding that hot peppers…can have a positive effect on dementia patients.
It's nice to see a man, who's passionate about this craft, getting the validity he deserves for his hard work. Congratulations Ed.
They're gonna need to wipe their *ss with a fire extinguisher. 😳🥵🥵🥵🫨😵‍💫😵🔥💥💀
Oh my god, i love this, smoking ed is the narrator explaining in great detail the slow and painfull deaths of the poor soldiers dragged down into diablos dungeon for a solid torture session.  And he is with them sounding inhumanely chill about the whole program.
Ed is a pepper god 🌶
I swear I had to watch like 6 ads to get through this video
At family gatherings, when my cousins and uncles say "Hey, we are masters of the hot pepper, let's see how hot yours are, can't be hotter than the ones we have in our yard", I'm Ed. I can tolerate a habanero with no visible reaction but the reaper and even the naga have me panic after a very small bite. Ed's tolerance is just out of this world.
Waiting for the pepper that has a 90% mortality rate.
Grown Reapers , need to grow Pepper X, but don’t think Ed will release to growers
Aw, thats sweet, he didnt know he was about to win. Just bought 3 for my family for Christmas.
Chillk Klaus is the best
Chili!!!!!!! Congrats to Ed and the team!!!!!!! Hot Ones!!!!!!!
Men that enjoy pain have a different auora
Having sampled how evil a small amount of a Carolina Reaper is, I would not go near a Pepper X. Spoil your day in one taste.
Ed has been working on this pepper for maybe 5-6years now?? FINALLY it gets recognized! Congratulations to Ed and his team! :D
Shawn really should have had a full one with Klaus
No wonder his teeth are orange
Come to Indonesia they   love it
Happy days! This was a wonderful video. Respect
yo why drop the ad right in Ed's emotional reaction to the award? undercuts the moment
'I'm in heat' is the best soundbyte ever
Would love to feel the experience of that pepper 😮
These guys were mad Elon Musk took their name of "X" for twitter so they felt like they had to release it early haha
Pardon me, Ed
The guy w/the glasses looks like Dustin Hoffman in that shot...like UNCANNY from nose up
11:35 "I love the flavour, I think there's some oak in it... and pencil"   If that flavour profile is not on the bottle of Pepper - x; would be disappointing.
DED CHU INVENT DAT PEPPUH? YES ....WHHHYYYY?....
Ed standing still at a techno dance comp, 'Oh don't worry, I'm moving just like these guys, just on the inside!'
The fact they're handling such a hot pepper without gloves terrifies me, imagine rubbing your eyes with that. O_O
Congratulations to Mr. Ed Currie indeed!  Mr. Ed Currie, my question to you is that will there be a version of pepper x for people who are not so accustomed to such high levels of heat to try so that me may still be able to enjoy the flavor of pepper X without so much pain?
“I think there’s some oak in it…”  Hahahahaha!!!  Another instant classic 😂
Klaus: ”Did you invent that pepper?”  Ed: ”Yeah”  Klaus: ”Why…”
Free Palestine!
Ed is the fukin man!
Not in a million years ill touch that
Massive congratulations to Edd and his team ,as  a newbie I shall not be tasting the pepper x 😅😅😅😅😅😅
Watching Ed eat chilies that make you feel like you are dying like its nothing still blows my mind Carolina Reapers are hot enough accidentally had a sauce i thought was just hot but was 80% Reaper and was a mess
My mom has always lived in Fort Mill SC and I’ve passed the business on Main Street thousands of times and wondered how they were still open. The businesses switch in and out all the time but they’ve been there for a decade or longer now. Now I see why he stayed opened. He’s made this hottest peppers in the world lol. Go little Fort Mill
That is a Big Mustard Mama.
What a great episode! Just didn't want it to end! 😁
The inventor is a straight gangster! If you ever had next level peppers its like someone attacked you from the inside
Ed is truly a legend & a hero... Definitely tougher than he looks!
Rip 🔥🥵🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Hahaha! Klaus, for h******! 😄😂 En ære af de helt store, så måske kan man godt forstå at du bliver lidt ... opstemt ... i situationen. Men ligefrem parringslysten havde jeg ikke lige set øhm... komme. 🤣  🇩🇰 Viking Chili League 🇺🇸
and best dressed goes to: Chili Klaus rocking Canadian business casual.
I love how Chili Klaus gives everyone one final hug before they all melt.
Surely it’s time to get chili klaus in for a row of all the hottest sauces from every season so far! 20+ wings too much to handle??
Mark Wiens would make a great guest
I was afraid to rub my eyes just watching this.
10:38 is when they eat the peppers :)
Ed you were so preoccupied with whether or not you could, you didn't stop to think if you should What hath thou released upon this world? 😅
1040, suffernig starts
Bravo!!!
How do you best protect your priced peppers? Pepper spray? Can you make one out of Pepper X that doesn't violate international laws against chemical weapons? Questions over questions...
They really need to get johnny scoville on here
Bro “I’m in heat” absolutely killed me 😂
Sean Evans has to be the worst interviewer ever. The dude is so robotic and weird.
When a pepper looks like that, it's telling you to fu@% off, or else.
I feel bad for laughing 😂
Pepper x. Isn’t that how the powerpuff girls were made
This is reparations for ww1 and ww2.
You can tell Sean was dreading this 😂
“I’m in heat” destroyed me more than that pepper destroy him lol
Ed deserves the recognition don’t get me wrong but Guinness World Records is a joke
Klaus has finally broken 🤣
Seeing Ed barely have a response to this heat leads me to think that he eats all the peppers that they make regularsly, like a way of gauging the potential of a line of peppers, regardless of their heat
I don't think it's that bad.
Nobody is thinking about this coming out the other end?
Ed is a mad scientist but on the side of good.  He uses his creations to torture people and ppl are happy to come back for more 😂. Congrats Ed on another Guinness record!
My family has made it a traditional to do the challenge on my birthday every year. The last dab pepper x is instantly hot! It wasn't as bad and the bathroom visits the next day lol
Quit every job until you end up working for a guy like Ed.
congrats Ed!!!  👏
Does Pepper X relate in any way to Twitter X?
I remember my first jabanero when I was 10.. This looks line fun.
Ed: Im feeling like them 😌 Them: 🔥🔥🧯🧯🧯🔥🔥🧯🔥🧯🧯🔥🔥🔥🔥
😊it's almost like he's going to keep trying till he makes one that gives a reaction like Claus... It's good but not just there yet...
Love how they compared having pepper x to a come up...referring to mushrooms. Such a weird feeling to get used to.
He probably got the hottest breath in the world too😂😂😂
make a thai level spicy pepper!!
Chili klaus lookin distinguished with that grey beard now! Ed lookin good and so happy too :)
This was the best commercial for this product. Im buying 2 bottles today.
Funniest 🤣 ever 😅
Love these guys
Bring YG back for the pepper X sauce!!
Strong notes of oak and pencil. Ok…😆
Congratulations Ed your evil masochistic ways have laid off again.
Pencil!  I'm getting pencil!
Nothing like an intense shared experience to bring people together
When I seen the record I was wondering when the collab would happen
Just looking at that pepper burns my eyes!
Man created a chemical weapon
Alright no one is saying it so I am going to say it. Get the Spice King
I for one do not want BLISTERS on my tongue....
“I’m in heat” 😂😂😂
My god, Ed. How do you barely have a reaction to eating a whole pepper?
time to tell the folks at Good Mythical Morning
Imma pay 15 large for Guiness to rank my jalapeños world's hottest... Better make it 20 grand
Find something that you love to do 1% as much as this guy loves working with peppers.
Dear God why?!?!?!!😳😳😳 But Congrats!!!!🍾
That pepper took out Klaus. Congratulations on the world record for sure!
Sean is gonna forever regret not doing the entire pepper
Klaus reminds me guy from latest John Wick
lolololol my forehead is sweating just from watching the video
Ed scares the bejesus out of me, any man that can eat that pepper like its nothing, is either an alien, or the superhero we've always needed
Ed seems like such a genuine guy who just loves his craft.
I'm in heat! needs to be on a shirt.
You guys are nuckin' futz. I love it!!!! I'm sticking to Siracha and Cholula though, lol.
"I think there's some oak in it" 🤣
Klaus saying “I am in heat” sent me😭😭😭
Why couldnt sean eat a whole one?
I want to know what happened the next day.
Great vid. Would love the outtakes ,that come up an hour later. When there all swearing and cursing life
Dude got the droopiest man jugs I’ve ever seen
Ed is a straight machine  love him! 😂 SUCH A BEAST
Aw what a genuine guy. That's sweet.
I love Ed. His vibe is *chef’s kiss*
Can’t wait for the one chip of this😂
“I’m in… heat. I’m in heat.” 😅😅
I grew Ed's pepper the HP22 ! Years ago Fell in love with super hots , Thank you for your work Ed!
This is the best thks for the funniest entertainment amazing how far this show has come
Iv'e bought Eds sauces. You see him in the background rocking back & forth...😳🥺😜🤪😝😡😣😓😩😫☠️💀 Ed love your sauces! 🥰😤
I see you suffering, and I don't want you to, but at the same time, I already ordered the last dab and I am waiting to launch the video the second time with a wing of death destroying me. I'll be with you guys, with the wise words of the Chili Klaus "WHY?"
That was legendary !!! Especially if you love eating heat
This is basically an ad for Ed and Heatonist and I love it. I can't wait to try the sauce. I love the Apollo sauce.
I love you smokin ed curry
He already had the world record.  Hua?
Pepper literally looks like a habanero that sat in chernobyl for a decade then a demon pooped it out 😂 insane!!!
Tripping Balls....l😅😅❤
Sad to see Sean/Shaun not eat one... Wot The... I'd love to eat one!!! Poo out the seeds and grow a plant Chilli Clause.
OOOOOH MY GAWD.....right when the took first chew......OOOOOH GAAAAAWD
CHIIIILLI KLAAAAAAAUUUUUUUS
Great to see Chili Klaus back he is such a vibe. Congrats to Ed & his team on the pepper :)
Last Dab is so good on eggs in the morning I have to watch myself least I burn through the entire bottle in a week. Congrats Ed, any clue when you will be cutting loose powder?
Prince Harry... Wot The!?!?
Ed is superhuman, Bless him. Poor Chili...lol!
Congratulations Ed on the Guinness record, well deserve.
Fantastic! I love how composed Ed is, and able to explain us what the boys are going through xD
"I'm in heat". I am now forever saying that when I eat something spicy 😅
At like 10 minuets you can see the concern on Klaus' face lol
Kurt Miller decided to talk smack about Ed Currie and thinks that because he thinks his name is Johnny Scoville, but it isn;t he is Kurt Miller and just a bully in pepper world.
Sean and Klaus had their soul leave their body, meanwhile Ed: -munch munch munch-
But that comes later when you're in pain! Sweet Jesus
Ed is a legend
let's grab a bite from the most *powerful* plant based *chemical weapon* on earth in front of cameras 😅
I wanna see the behind the scenes
The hottest pepper In the world is really a chocolate Primatano Pepper Serious Stuff you can make. Pepper spray out of it.
Who cares if it’s a hot pepper if no one can obtain it , I don’t think anyone is going to care much
Better eat some ice cream after eating Pepper X. You'll be looking for some relief the next morning whilst sitting on the "throne" "COME ON ICE CREAM!!!"
Ed names his pepper Pepper X.  Elon Musk has entered the chat.
Oak and pencil 🤣 I loved it. Start to finish.
Shall thoes trying to steal what Ed has created recieve colon cancer.
Important note that was only alluded to in the video: I read an interview with Ed about Pepper X, and he said that part of the motivation behind the release was control of and income from the product. Carolina Reapers got out of Puckerbutt’s control and out into general circulation faster than expected, and a lot of companies - even massive multinational corporations - rolled out products that had (or claimed to have) Reaper in them but never shared a dime of the profits with Ed and his team. They’ve tightened up legal control over the name “Pepper X” and at least somewhat over distribution rights, in the hopes that this time they’ll be rightfully compensated for all their hard work. Good on ‘em.
The creator looking basically unphased is the craziest thing.
It’s so sad that a man’s hard work can be stolen by a corporate giant!
Ed won’t be happy until someone’s head explodes from one of his peppers. Then he won’t be happy until it happens immediately.
Why? He asks 😂❤
Send two of these peppers to Rhett and Link.
I had Reapers and capsaicin drops with Smokin Ed at a hot sauce show a few years ago. If I meet him again I’ll try X with him. Lol
Y'all killed Klaus 😂
Ed's reaction to this pepper tells me that his vault of hotter pepper varieties goes wayyyyy hotter than we think
I respect u all more now 😮😢😂❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Bro after pepper x it should be illegal 😂
I just presume his food company is a cover for military research at this point... 👀🌶️🔥🥵
a lot of people compare it to a what?  a come up?  what's that mean?
Ed is a monster 😮
Is always nice to see Chili Klaus suffer
I love that Ed is not tv trained.
Is there any way i can get seats to grow them in my salsa garden?
I just wanna grow these in my garden next year… of course when i finally grow some reapers theyll let this out lol
I love this 😂 dude gonna come back with a 5m Scoville
"Did you invent that?"  "Yes."  "Why?"
I’m disappointed that you didn’t eat a whole one with Chili Sean. You gotta redo it with him
Wow
I love how its not even something they just recently managed to make. Theyve been sitting on the f*cking thing for 10 years😂
Ed is truly one of a kind
Congratulation Ed and the whole PBC Family ❤🌶️
I think Chili is dead
How does this pepper compare to the Apollo pepper
3:57 "I like the way that people look when they get really scared from eating my hot sauce, it's just a lot of fun" absolute savage 😂 i love it
I hope  Orpa in Malawi is watching Klaus experience the flavor😆
Klaus looked like he didn’t want to do it.
The pepper was so hot that Chili Klaus actually went in heat and started looking for a suitable mare
"Did you create this 🥵?" "Yeah 😅" "Why? 😭"
@11:17 Ed's face haha
Ed is a freaking gangster.
I was reminded of that Simpson episode where Homer poured candle wax  down his throat and didn’t react to anything.. feels like Ed’s throat is naturally candle wax
More moved by the award than the pepper! Smokin' Ed crazy for that
how that dude eats and stand's his creation is just.............😶😶😶😶😶😶😶
You could see how nervous Sean was!!! Shaking! I would be too man
Didn't even need an introduction, the moment I saw Ed on screen, I knew how terrifying this video was going to be
Ed’s bees or somebody’s got on my sweet banana peppers this year. The peppers lit me up. I live about 25 miles from FortMill in York SC.
I never believed it, but here we go, straight to Planet X.
Sean struggling to speak after eating a sliver and all i'm thinking about is how Klaus is probably being incinerated from the inside out after eating a whole pepper.
Poor Klaus
12:37
That's hilarious!  I've never seen men give birth before!
You made your friend come by airplane  And you didn't even eat the entire chilly  That is low.. 😅
WHY WHY WHY.😳😳😳 someone will definitely die when eating this.😳😳😳
Pencil lol
Ed is the boss. 3x hotter wow
When does the pepper actually go on sale in stores?
O LOOOOVE CHILI KLAUS!!^^    Aye, yaw crazy for that!! \O>
He wiped around his eyes one too many times 😂 they were actually swelling up
@10.11 when he rubbed his brow.
"Im in heat!"
Congratulations to Ed & his team <3 Og Klaus, fra een jyde til en anden, du er fantastisk!
Im in HEAT..
Ed is a badass, evil genius.  That thing looks like pure concentrated evil.
"I'm in heat!" is going to become one of my favorite catchphrases ever!
Did you invent that pepper? “Yeah” Why 😂😂😂😂
Love that Sean Evans rocking that Saint Alfred… shout to Chicago Wicker Park!!! Also go white sox!!!!
Is there any way to send you a hot sauce from Berlin, Germany? Would like to see an international version 🔥
The pepper looks gorgeous, I wish I could grow it myself one day to see the whole plant and all the different shapes of the pods.
Amazing! Congrats to the whole team for bringing us this epic video.
I'm in heat... We will never know how that sentance is gonna end.
I would like to buy a whole pepper x. Can that be done?
all of them snapping like that at the end is so hilarious for some reason.
Ed is not human, no way
...it continues😅
Ed is an absolute unit. Love that guy.
Ed grows these puppies right by my house in fort mill sc. right outside Charlotte nc
"I'm in heat". best thing I've ever heard
Mr Currie well done 👏You have destroyed the competition! You have blown away the Hot Ones best! Above all you eat that pepper x as if it was a cheese and onion crisp. Amazing! I'm wondering if you can breed a pepper as hot as police issue pepper spray which is around 5 million scoville?
The best interviewer ever.
Did Ed Currie make this because a British guy beat him with Dragon's Breath?  Nobody seems to talk about Dragon's Breath, it was created by a British guy which dethroned the Carolina Reaper  So I guess Ed Currie got jealous because a British guy was better than him and made Pepper X.  Just a guess.  You should have Neal Price on the show. (The guy who made Dragon's Breath and beat Ed Currie that one time)
I have waited for this for so long
Klaus, Klaus, Klaus! You give a lot of yourself!
hope everyone is ok ❤felt every minute
This is so wholesome!
Smokin' Ed Currie could easily survive in outer space
New hot ones sauce coming soon lol
Bro you guys made BBC news
That chili was hotter than all of Denmark’s cousins combined.
2:39 But a come up of what? LSD? Mushrooms? MDMA?
I love how the guys that invented it are subtly talking about it after eating the pepper while Klaus and Sean are holding on for dear life!! They instantly turned yellow’ish white after taking a bite!🤣
Ed explaining how everyone is feeling, so poetically, while everyone else is dying, makes this video for me.
every room klaus steps in becomes 10 degrees higher
Suriname people make sambal out of bonnet peppers :)
Sounds like something a serial killer would say man.
It's funny how us human being love watching people's get hurt, smh.
"Did you do that? Did you invent that pepper? WHY?"
Ed not only broke the record but he broke Chili Klaus!
Congratulations on achieving weapon grade SCU in a natural pepper 🙂
I laughed out loud
The heat of the Pepper X is a joke, only the Guinness Book of Records pepper can bring real tears in Ed's eyes!
The real spice king, not that cam guy
Love how giggly Klaus is before them eating it lol
ED was more emotional receiving the award than after eating the chili pepper. 😅
CRAZYNESSSSS!!!  The Reaper took us down!  INSANITY!!!!   Congratulations Ed!
David blaine needs to try it
What a lovely guy. So passionate about what he makes and getting emotional when rewarded for all his hard work.
Did you invent that pepper? Yes. Why?
I love Chili Klaus, he one of the one.
Why had a pepper where it’s almost impossible to eat it lol
Bring it on
I want to know what it's like coming out the other end
I'm in heat
Until this, I was always proud in saying I'd eaten the three hottest peppers in the world. But I can't say that anymore 😭 and I'm afraid of pepper x tbh
Currie is like, "Is this a habanero"?
Has anyone checked on Klaus since?
AS a straight, 45 years old, married german hot ones Fan: i am deeply in love with Klaus and i also admire Sean and Ed and the whole freaking Team! H❤T
Ed Curry biggest pepper fraud ever, stolen CR genetics from 7pot Primo
Cheers.. 😅😅 you're was the host, awesome job.
Ed, Taylor Swift WISHES lol
Congrats to Ed for turning his addiction from something bad to a positive...well except for the pain from the heat. im 5 yrs clean from opioids
Got goosebumps when he got choaked up! You can feel his sincerity that he believes in his team and the effort of everyone. Always makes a win that much better 😊
🥲🥹😢 AUGUST 23 AND THE PEPPER IS A VIRGO
Ed is a living legend! This is an amazing video and massive respect to you all!
Ed Currie showing us why he is the real SPICE KING. 🤯
Rated x pepper adults only
can we get max and chad from cold ones on here and you on there
Congratulations to Paul Giamatti. Who knew!
thank you for bringing the goat back in action again. and by that i obviously mean the undisputed king Chili Klaus😂❤
Such a bad name though
I would love to test myself ;)
Why do some guys crave screaming hot peppers? I think I know. In what other situation do men cry openly, hug each other passionately, and “feel each other’s pain” so acutely? Fascinating.
I don’t like 911 dispatchers
Chili Clause ❤
I appreciate and applaud every effort into this pepper i love spicy but don't think I'll ever try it  but congratulations 🎉
❤ X
Did you invent that pepper??......... Yes.......... WHY 🙈😂😂😎🤟
KLAUS  IS  B R E E D I N G
Team work, makes the dream work! 💯
If "Pepper X: I'm in Heat" isn't their immediate motto, they need a better marketing team
I grew Carolina reapers once, never ate them except touching a piece to my tongue.  They're so hot after I washed the knife i used to cut out the seeds, i touched the knife to my tongue and my tongue started burning again. So i washed the knife again (each time by hand, so i properly scrubbed it with a sponge) and it burned my tongue again. I then washed it a third time and after it dried i touched it to my tongue and it burned again.  Maybe because it was serrated, its possible the grooves could've still held some pepper oil but this pepper is insane. I cant wait to get my hands on pepper x seeds. I just love collecting weird plant seeds, poisonous, spicy, intoxicating, etc.
I simply won't believe Pepper-X is the world's hottest pepper until it's in the stomach of Johnny Scovil of Chase the Heat and I hear from his own mouth it's the hottest pepper he's ever eaten. Nothing else could convince me because it's shocking the hottest pepper pod in the world is not a chocolate pod. I want to see Johnny Scovil tell us from his mouth it's indeed the hottest pepper he has ever eaten.
IM IN HEAT!
Is PepperY or Z on the way? Oh, be sure to take a Fire Extinguisher with you to the WC.
Wow! Three times hotter than the Carolina Reaper, as Ed explained? I can't even fathom that level of heat! This season, I grew several hot peppers, including the Carolina Reaper. I believe mine didn't quite hit the expected level of heat – they felt somewhat below average (I'm a chilli lover but new to growing them). However, when I sliced a pepper in half and took a bite from just a quarter of it, I quickly discovered that my heat tolerance isn't as robust as I thought. 😅 Huge respect to Ed for cultivating these fiery gems and to all of you for sharing your experiences with us!
It's really sad to hear that people are trying to steal his intellectual and physical property.  It's a cutthroat world for sure.  Congrats to Ed and their entire team!
klaus didn't say the line! i am so disapoointed
people who just stand around slack jawed with their mouth open are so weird 💀
First "hotter than my scandinvaian cousins" and now "Im in heat", Chili Klaus is the best 😂
Does anyone else physically sweat when watching people eat spicy food.. No joke, I always get really hot and start to sweat when watching people eat spicy food.
Congrats! I love chili Klaus 😂😂😂
ok this is scary hot
If you are ever in heat, eat a pepper.
"I'm in heat"
Everyone has known it's been called Pepper X for like 6 years now. That BS about the label is made up.
I love Chili Klaus ❤❤❤
Smokin Ed is officially the Walter White of peppers! Well deserved! Thank you for so much pain in my life!!
Another banner, but Ed cares just as much about every single one. Fantastic stuff.
It’s just why would anyone hurt themselves doing this?  If I tried this, a small piece, I’d die.
Ahh I love South Carolina. Also, Reaper Pizza is something that you should try!!!
Pepper X should be called either  Devil's Breath  Demon Seed Hellfire Inferno
Wow! At over 2 million SHU, that’s not a flavor. That is a weapon! 😮
Smokin' Ed is the genius of the pepper world. Seen this guy years ago in many documentaries. I look forward to seeing him in many more for years to come! Congrats to him and his team!
Great peppers and such, but ole Ed needs to work on bleaching those teeth!
"Did you do that? Did you invent that pepper?" "Yeah.." "Why?"
Congrats to Smokin' Ed Currie for almost killing Chili Klaus
Pepper X  sounds AWESOME
Can you get hurt from this? I imagine the ring burn alone sending me to the hospital
This is the dumbest thing I've ever seen!
Gongrats to Ed & the whole team behind pepper X! This is my favourite line up ever! :) I'd love to see an extended cut and more from this crowd. Maybe tasting of differetn varieties together?
I love chilli Clauses last question 😂😂
Savages! Also, congratulations!
Congratulations, I've got my Last Dab Xperience on order.  And just to save time before I try it, you're all monsters, and thanks!
"I'm in heat!" 😂
"I'm in heat..." Klaus 2023. 〰😎😅
How could you NOT love Ed? He’s just such a cool guy. He had really humble beginnings and I’m so glad he’s made it to where he is now!
“I’m in heat” 😭😭😭
Ata boy Ed!
please combine peper x with a sweat peper xD i want to know what happens
Chilli eating starts at 10:35
Ed currie is a madman
CHILLI KLAUS, GOOSBUMPS!!!
Until Johnny Scoville reviews this pepper I won't believe it. You pay big money to get in Guiness.
Scam
Ed seems like a very cool guy😌
Why does he keep almost-touching his eyes? :D so nerving :D
😂 I love this!!! I want one now 😅
Klaus looks like a cool guy to hang out 😂
No one:  Chili Klaus: IM IN HEATTT!!
While I have no doubts that X is the hottest pepper in the world, Guinness are some of the last people I'd take it from
Clause heard the rating and immediately looked like he was regretting his decisions 😂
Ed almost crying from happiness while receiving the Guinness award was so touching. Well deserved, thank you for bringing the spice to the world!
HE HAS BEEN SLAIN!
OK, Ed Currie eats peppers with over 2.5M Scoville and skips through his day, but a plaque tears up his eyes!!  Just kidding Ed!  Congratulations on a job well done!
lol
And the question is....WHY?
Carolina Reaper @ a measly 1.6 million Scoville units !!?..... so it is basically a breath-mint nowadays .
Klaus gets all the love! Everyone here is wonderful, great vid
Chili walking off told me that's a hot lil number.
I'm a simple man; I see chilli klaus and sean evans, I like.
Im guessing Ed has far fewer TRPV1 receptors.
YIKES!
Thank you, guys. Love this show and Ed for something I love and have been eating hot stuff for 20-plus years. I'm coming to SC to see your place soon. You guys make me laugh.
🎉❤😊 is it possibile to buy some?
No amount of money in the world would make me do this
I love the flavor... I think there's some oak in it
How the F is Ed not even flinching
CAME FOR CHILI KLAUS.  STAYED FOR CHILI KLAUS.
Sean has not PTSD but PCKD - Post Chili Klaus Syndrome
This begs the question that even if you could, should you do it?
Can they put pepper x in pepper spray.
They should've called it the Demon Pepper or maybe the Devil Pepper. Pepper X isn't particularly noteworthy in any way.
Pepper X = Krabby Patty in terms of secret formula security
N. F. W.
This is my new favorite video
All four of you should have sekz. That would be hot and spicy
Repent and believe the gospel! Jesus died for our sins and rose 3 days later so we could be forgiven of our sins and be gifted with everlasting life. Put your faith in Jesus and follow him! Life is short, please make the right choice today!
ed, noah is not to be trusted
Looks horrible!
Pepper-X, it's less painful than a vasectomy.
I’m in heat!!!!!
come on Sean, as the host of the show you should have eaten a whole one
What a holesome moment when they announce the surprise, so sweet.
But.. but why??  BECAUSE I CAN
It even LOOKS dangerous.. I'm surprised they don't spontaneously combust
You guys should have invited @skippy62able! The beast is the legend of eating spicy stuff
This is my whole heart such a great channel and people
IM IN HEAT!!
How about a pepper spray made with pepper X for a new product line.
Shawn rocking the new teeth! Had the rolly for awhile now... movin up lol
The guttural fear in Sean's eyes when they bring out the pepper to eat. That is a man that has never forgotten his experiences with the reaper.
lol there in pain and he’s like I’m fine like the meme
This guy has veen hiding this for 10 years? I cant imagine what else he has.   That peoper just looks incredible, cant imagine how they got to that pepper. Makes me just want to see how peppers are created.
Any pepper that doesn't have an amazing flavor that overshadows the hot isn't worth eating
Ed ate that like a champ true inspiration
What's the address he said in the end? I with my faulty english just tried 2 addresses, both were wrong.   Thank you
Ed is prob thinking making a hotter one that can break him; He didnt even flinch on that one.
Give everyone In a warzone this spicy peice of peace and they'll all chilli out man
What I learn from Ed is that when you get the greed and mega-corporation out of business and replace it with love, the world gets better and people get closer. Congrats brother!
Its the hottest in the UNIVERSE!
CHILI KLAUS!!!!
Thumbs up for introduction but the capse factor 🙄😞 F. U.C . 🤬 Take that to the clubhouse
"i'm in heat" :D :D
Your face does get tighter. Everything swells.
Sou seu fã Ed Currie parabéns por essa pimenta maravilhosa! Estaremos no aguardo aqui no Brasil.
I love Chili Klaus.....  "I'm in Heat! and Did you create that pepper????? Why???" are classics.  I know it was hot, he could barely speak!!!! I love this
This is a huge win . Great job .
Congratulations to Ed and the team from Crystal lake!!!  Can't wait to try it !!!
“I’m in heat~” Chili Klaus 2023
11:39 when you hit the blunt and they ask you whats in it
So how does PuckerButt come up with pepper names? They get absolutely 420 blazed and just start talking. 🤣🤣
Ed ia my man!!!
Sean too big time to eat it with Klaus now?
Anyone else appreciate the irony of Ed choking up, tearing up and having issues talking while be awarded the official Guinness hottest pepper?
Man, Ed really deserved this.  You can tell this is not a job or simple hobby for him.  When he found out he had won this record he almost cried.  This seems like a "magnum opus" kind of moment.  The passion he has for these chiles is a kind of passion not many people have for anything, and there's something about that kind of dedication, hard work and expertise that you have to admire and respect so much.
Wow! This is my favorite video! Congrats to Ed, his team. I would love to see celebrities that are willing to test themselves.
amazing!
Yeah I looooooove the flavor burning
Ed seems like such a genuine person. Seeing someone passionately love their work/art and be recognized for it, is such a beautiful moment!
Ed's tolerance is crazy
Dang, even for Klaus that Pepper X just looked like torture. Mad respect for eating an entire pepper
10:07  When Klaus looks concerned...  RUN!!!!  DON'T DO IT MAN!!!!!!!!!
I M I N H E A T
So happy for you Smokin' Ed, you deserve this.  I know you will continue to up your game.
It was so hot we only got 2 snaps from Chili Klaus at first 😂😂😂
This is the hardest I've seen Ed struggle with spice.
That was awesome! Congrats Ed!🎉🎉🎉
11:35 it's very spiceum
I don't even want to know how it burns on the other side!! 🤪
I never thought the creation and tasting of insanely hot food would be so humble. What a journey
The two on the right took the antidote
Coming soon Pepper X pro Max
I accidentally rubbed my eyes while watching this and I am burning now!
Lost so much respect for Heatonist for using extracts, however major respect to Smokin’ Ed! Amazing work Ed! Love what you are doing!
Lost so much respect for Heatonist for using extracts, however major respect to Smokin’ Ed! Amazing work Ed! Love what you are doing!
the im in heat in the last seconds of the clip was toooo good LOL
there is a limit to that “just because we can” or at least there should be
How in the world Ed didn't even make a face after biting his Pepper X
WHy:) The tears of Sean is so funny. Please keep these comming up;)
Peppers are like big shops. You pay at the end.
There is no need. Anything more than your average jalepeno is overkill lol
i just lost al respect for Seean because he didn`t eat a whole one with Klaus. ALso respect to Klaus for taking on the worlds hottest pepper!!
".... i'm in heat"
Old dude's teeth are so yellow from being burned by hot peppers.
This whole capcaisin culture is fascinating to me. In terms of ethnopharmacology (to give it a fancy word), the hallmarks of the pain trance that the Scovilles cause all technically could be called psychedelic. The "(head) high" Sean often references, along with all the varied effects, sometimes even including mild hallucinations and almost always involving the creatively expressed emotional honesty that comes with shared bonding in anguish, seems like a truly transformative experience.  When they said "cheers" and popped the peppers, it immediately started to resemble a shared trip till the very end -- a beautiful sight to behold! ❤  Congrats and thank you to you all, for all your incredible work and your amazing attitude 😊 I began using more heat in all my food due to Hot Ones; so thanks for that as well! Spicy travels! 🔥
I literally saw an article about pepper x being officially ranked, and knew this video would come
Ed is not a human.
I'm in heat said no one ever... oh....
so actually what Dumbledore drank in the cavern was this cool to know
Is chilli claus still with us?
Great episode. Moar Ed and Klaus!
"Oh no, Klaus is breeding" 😂
The man , The Legend.... Chili Klaus... Why!? =D
I want a pepper x not a lastdab the last dab is weak atleast the prev one
Gotta love Ed's passion!
Ed and clause are brilliant.  please get that mad scientist on more. he's a cool customer
Congratulations Ed and the rest of the team! ❤️ Pepper X #1
whoever named this thing pepper X. bro was one step away from becoming a super villain
It's always fun watching Sean and Chili  take a heat punch🤣🤣 Go through the video frame by frame when they take the pepper to the face and witness all the emotions with every new frame!
Am sure they had days of a yogourt diet to put several coats of lactease to protect their innards. God forbid if they use Crisp-R to design a hotter pepper than X for consumption.
I want to buy but I didn’t find my country Saudi Arabia????
👍🏾👍🏾 crazy
The look of that pepper is enough for me to say nope 🙅‍♂️
Too bad Guniess world records are a sham that is paid for. Just look up Tommy Talarico. That said, I believe Smokin Ed made the most gangster of peppers out there.
Just want to inform everyone that this video hast 2.6 Million views.
Chili Klaus: "Did you invent that pepper?" Smokin' Ed: "Yeah..." Klaus: "Why!?" That was next level pain-induced humor.
Congrats to you all for trying this new pepper!  also to you and your team ed!
I was legit worried for Chilli Klaus
Pepper x , formerly known as Twitter
I bet its not that bad
Horrible episode.. more Klaus!
Ed Currie, very calmly: We're in imense pain, our arms are burning, our whole body is burning, I have a single tear in my eye
Good God Almighty, 2.6 million scoville.. a million more than the reaper. You are a mad scientist Ed Currie. You are a gift to the world. Congrats for the World Record
Jalapeños are spicy to me
A moment of silence for these guys lower GI tract. Except you Ed..yours needs to be studied.
Im confused, hasn't Pepper X been out for a few years?
12:14: "It's got no throatburn like the reaper, that comes on later when you're in pain."  I'm sure they were just thinking "hey, where's the nice throatburn?", Ed is an attentive host.
I can't wait to try it.  I can eat any pepper by the handful.
Ed acting like he's eating a Big Mac
I bet it’s hotter than his Scandinavian cousins …
I’m sorry….you couldn’t pay me enough money…
Is Klaus still alive?
Cant forget collong farrell impersonating klaus on chillis, hilarious
For someone that eats hot peppers and wings a lot, what does that do to your body over time?
How is ed so calm ???
straight to stomach cancer
That's the first time I've seen chilli Klaus bow out to a pepper like that. That is some serious stuff
They've made anew biological weapon 😂
so its basically a carolina reaper but on steroids.
WHERE IS THE EXTENDED VERSION?
We love the Carolina reaper we dry them in dehydrators  Powder them up in a blender add garlic salt A little pepper Italian seasoning They are a perfect fruity flavor And a little goes a long way so you don't have to use much of the powder Just remember when you're drying them split all your peppers so they dry even l And after a day and a 1/2 2 days into dehydrator put them in a blender Perfect for anything you eat just remember a little goes a long way
Chiiiiiili claus
OK, but why though.    WHY?
That was amazing.
👏👏👏👏👏 👍😁👌
What a switch to see Sean be the one flailing and trying to deliver a plug under duress!  🤣🤣🤣 Hilarious
Why do I love giving people da bomb at home? Am I sick? 😂
That was beautiful. Just what I needed. Well done Ed.
Klaus: Did you do that? Did you invent that pepper?  Ed: yes  Klaus: ...why?
Congrats Brother!
Chili Klaus is right up there with Lego, HC Andersen and Mads Mikkelsen as the pride and joy of Denmark! Vi elsker dig Klaus!
Very happy to see Klaus back again!!! His episode is still my favourite to this day. Also love the way Ed gives recognition to his team for the success of making Pepper X. Truly very humble of him.
Ed is the man!!!!
Chili Klaus: Did you invent that? Ed: yes. Chili Klaus: WHY?  ROFLMAO!
Man’s said he was done!!!!
This is a must try
Dude there is absolutely no way, Ed said it last 2hours!!! So causally too 😂
If "nope" grew on trees. 🌶 🫑 🌶
Chilli Claus came in to season.
When legends meet!
Bro when are we going to get Nardwuar on Hot Ones?!?! We have to know!
You should have ed and klaus on here more often lol 😂
This video had me grinning from ear to ear the whole way through.
his teeth have the same color as his peppers
Chilli Klaus : ‘I think there’s some poke in it’  ‘Pencil’ legendary 😂😂
This man and his team impact the whole planet. No wonder he's in tears
I feel sorry for their buttholes lol
The mannerisms of Klaus and somewhat Sean definitely reminded me of myself when i am wayyy too high. It was mentioned that it almost feels like a 'come up'. i wonder if capsaicin might have psychoactive effects at extreme doses?
My thoughts on new pepper:  F**k you.
Recently ate my first reaper and it was a small guy… I can’t imagine the psychoactive pain Chili Claus is going through.
i never understand exactly what is meant by "the scale is ligarithmic". the ammount of SHU in a pepper is literally defined by the capsaïcinoid content of a product in ppm multiplied by 16 (at least for the 2 main capsaïcinoids naturally present in peppers, other naturally occuring capsaïcinoids are not as "spicy"). hence, pure capsaïcine scores 16.000.000 SHU (16 times 1.000.000 (parts per million)). this means a carolina reaper has 100.000 parts capsaïcine for every 1.000.000 parts of pepper, and pepper x has 162.000 parts of capsaïcine for every 1.000.000 parts of pepper. The scoville scale was designed in 1912 i believe, and the original scale was based on how many dilutions where requered before a chili extract was no longer experienced as "spicy" by taste testers. now adays we measure SHU in an objective way, by determining capsaïcine content. the conversion factor of 16 between ppm and SHU was implemented to make sure that the objectively measured results more or less correspond with the subjective research done back in 1912. the fact that dilutions where used to define SHU in 1912 does not mean that a pepper with twice the amount of SHU containts 10X the ammount of capsaïcine. however the eater experiences it is subjective, but the correlation between SHU and capsaïcinoid content is definitly linear, not logarithmic.
There is something special about eating super spicy stuff with other people. It's cathartic. Get you some really hot hot sauce and do toothpicks with your friends. It's strengthens relationships going through it together.
I have to say. I'm disappointed Sean didn't eat a whole one.
Epic.
I will let you in on a secret, the one who is trying to steal your peper X secret is Elon Musk. He needs your formula because your peper X makes the most potent rocket fuel.
"just that violent and ever growing" 😂😂😂 made his face tighter. 😂😂😂 Ed sounded like he was about to throw up😂😂😂😂
Chilli Claus is the ultimate scoville victim LOL
Shaun, Chris Evans evil twin brother..🤔
I'm in heat 😂
Doctors play God Ed plays the Devil’s interior decorator.
Ed is a literal mad scientist
has any one of the four threw up after the cameras stopped rolling? asking for a friend
it's one of the dumbest thing I've seen for a long time. I just don't get it. What's the point?
Love how ed is the calmest out of all of them
" .. two, somebody is going eat this .. and it wont be me" 🤣🤣🤣
Finally we can see the showmanship of the show 4 people eat the pepper. Two pretend to die for the camera
Congratulations Ed, four brave men eating the pepper made me laugh out loud. Well done.
Eds out here like 🤨 analyzing the flavors while there just dying 😅🤣😂
I NEED 1
Did I just sit through a 14 minute ad?
I wonder how much damage this does to your internal organs?
Chili Klaus is a legend.
I'm genuinely curious, is there any culinary point to this whatsoever?
Dis you invent that?  Yeah..... Why? 🤣🤣🤣🤣
13:48 - the best part of the video
All of these guys are just so nice ❤
I love Chilli Claus 😂😂😂😂😂😂
This is madness. 😂🎉
Ed is the literal Dr Pepper. Crazy to think what he still has up his sleeve.
Amazing. I want to laugh but feel such empathy for the pain. I’d probably just faint immediately….
Nope
I absolutely love this video!!  I was smiling the whole time.  I dont do that much anymore so thanks for that!!
0:07 Klaus asking the important questions.
I understand hot food. I understand sometime stepping outside of your comfort zone to try something different. I do NOT understand eating food that makes you feel fear, or pain. I do not believe something this hot could have a flavor to it, as the burning would make tasting so secondary it would be meaningless. It's kinda terrifying that people keep making hotter and hotter types of these things, to the point of what feels like near insanity. It's like trying to breed a natural version of condensed pepper spray mixed with just a little bit of nerve gas gel for flavor.
do people actually buy these? Is the company making profit off it?
Yes please and i would love a full PepperX aswell
"Did you invent that pepper?"  "Yeah."  "Why??" -- Audible Pain in his Voice
Finally the Spicy Gang all together!! 🪄🌶️🌶️🫑🌶️🌶️
So hot melts bottle
Bro even im feeling the heal through my screen 🤧
Klaus always just leaves lol.
And what happened afterwards...great work from Ed and the Team!!
Hope that new record holder Pepper X has the better lineage than the Carolina Reaper which is fake and 7Pot Primo in the real.
Love you ed thank you 😢😅
Trippers ❤️
Pepper X is so potent... it made Klaus ovulate! 😄😄😄
Poor Chili Klaus!!
Chilli Klaus ery hilarious every time he eats hot pepper 😂😂
"I'm in heat" 😭🤣
10:35 to skip to the taste test
10:30
Get Klaus some ice cream 😭
You guys are crazy. 😆
epic
Ed choking and tearing up when mentioning his team then laughing when everyone is on fire, Klaus trying to hold it together so sweetly, four guys making history suffering hideously but so gentlemanly: what a jolly good show.
Very cool seeing this science being pushed to its limit but I’ll have to take your word on the heat and taste.
That was the best episode ever
First time I ate a habanero I vomited after 10min of pain. Idk how these guys do it
Sean's scared of Spicy Cam.
For the ones that don't have flavor, use it to make pepper spray.
Ed. You need protection just reach out. To body some corrupt gov official is every guys dream
Chili Klaus went all white in last few years..looks good on him.
Chilli claus: “Was… was it you that invented that pepper?”  “Yes” Chilli claus: “Why?” 😂😂😂
I lol'd REALLY hard at Klaus' "why?" !   😂
This has been created. The ghost chilli pepper remains the hottest and the spiciest natural chilli in the world.
Ed has to have COVID. 🤣 Crazy how he downed that!
Chili Klaus was the second person in the world that ate a whole pepper x. Does that mean that  nobody but Ed on the farm dared to eat 1 in the 10 years since they made it? Scary stuff😂
That pepper just looks like pure evil 😈😈😈
When will the seeds of Pepper X be available for purchase at PuckerButt?
Any episode with chilie claus is so memorable I love that man “I’m in heat” had me dying 😂
Where is David Blaine
Congrats on the record and fp for even attempting the challenge, my face would peel off and dissolve if I even had a smell of it 😂
Missing the legendary Johnny Scoville. 😢
I want Chili Klaus to retire from this craziness, and retire to mere scotch bonnets!
The bros dying and ed is just like oh i got one tear
I was scared to rub my eyes watching this
The pepper bouquet at the end 💀💀
I seen a story about the Pepper X on the news last night.
Nearly 2.7 million scoville, wow.
“Why?” 💀
Did you invent that pepper….  yeah why?….. 😂🤣😅😂🤣😂🤣😂😅😅😅😂🤣😂🤣😂😂🤣🤣😂😂❤️❤️🙂
I like how he went straight to stating that it was a team effort to make that pepper ....Respect 🤘😎🤙
Chili klaus coming in hot to take the punch. What a hero
They just keep making these chillis hotter. Its ganna be at the point were its just absurd haha. Like just the smell is ganna end up singing nose hairs
6:32 Ed says "hey Andy" like they've had multiple run-ins in the past 😂
Poor chili klaus. I hope he's alright
Maybe the best youtube video ever.
It's nice to see someone with the passion that Ed has for his business.
What a cool, fun job would it be to go around giving out those Guinness World Record awards?
It's not 2.7mil, it's precisely 2693000. I'd like to see the formula.
And here's me.. Hot ketchup is too hot for me 😅🤣
"Did you invent that pepper?" "Yeah!" (in pain) "why?"  Klaus has my heart. Congrats to Ed and the team!
Sean is totally lame for not eating a whole pepper 😮 . Wusss
I love watching people succeed at what they love doing. Good job team Ed Currie.
Hats off to Ed, that man is wholesome and just awesome to have on the show. I'm buying some sauce!
Please show us how the capsaicin levels are measured. Get really nerdy in the explanation. Thank you!
Eds a beast haha
I want to try one of these!
This is amazing, and terrifying, in equal measure.  Congratulations Ed. You rule. Officially.
I love seeing you but I also don’t like it😂😂😂 Sean and Klaus are the best duo ever 😂
My favorite pepper name has to be the chocolate bhutlah still.
This was so funny. 😂😂 “ am in heat” killed me 😂😂
So when they gonna start using capsaicin for a localized anesthetic?
Congratulations but ill pass on eating that 😂
Probably burns even worse coming out😂
Im not sure I understood the explanation of the Scoville.. if its based on dilution in water, then how can adding more of the same pepper not require more water before it is tasteless?
When you take pepper business seriously
That is a gorgeous pepper. Its looks like Oscar the grouch, beautiful in its funkiness. This was really fun 🙂 hosting and interviewing while consuming that must've been a challenge.
11:16 pleas name music ? :)
"I'm in heat" is the new "It's hotter than my Scandinavian cousins"
im in HeEaAATtT hahaha Ed just stood there like it was candy
What a beautiful, sadistic man.
why?
- *sobbing* Did you do that? Did you invent that pepper? - *proudly* yeah - WHY…?
My dude in the blue cap is a pepperopath 🤯
You broke Klaus! Love that man!
I cannot wait to eat one of those peppers bro. Eating a Carolina Reaper is a life changing experience. I cannot even imagine what this would feel like.
"I'm in heat" 😂
Wow, Ed just ate the pepper and went on with it.  Pretty amazing.
Hva så chili Klaus❤🎉
Kick a few to Mr Johnny s I Trust his opinion
Has Sean always had those awful veneers? I never noticed his teeth before
How could you do that to your friend 😂😂
@12:33 they are all high as a kite off of Pepper X.  Amazing what endorphins will do.
Ed looks like the most normal guy in the world... but he's lowkey scary... a guy with this level of pain tolerance is unstoppable
Oh man the Epicurious video with Ed is one of my fav on YT. I looooove watching that video. He's so great. So to see him out here in the wild with the boys and taking us through the experience while CK is dying over there, is just so fantastic :D ED WE LOVE YOU! (Even if your award winning chilli tastes like pencil.)
We need jonnny scoville to review this ASAP!!
Time to let pepper X loose on the celebrities!🥵
Pepper X shouldn't even be legal to sell. It seems legitimately dangerous, and people can be seriously hurt.
Chili Klaus coming through clutch!! Lets go 🇩🇰
These are the real devil fruits.. 2.7M SHU!! Good Lord!!!!
There's an old saying some men just want to see the world burn. This man is one them
I could handle this pepper no problem
Chili Klaus is an international treasure
Surely large corporations wouldn't be unethical. They're run by such nice people.
Ed should be the picture of a mad scientist 🥼 🌶️
Who they trying to fool? There is no flavour to anything even close to this hot.
Yo Ed’s insane.
I would be in the hospital in a coma😩 I cannot understand how or why people do this to themselves
I have tried the pepper x and it's no f***ing joke!!! The burn was like standing in front of a blast furnace. The way it made my body feel was like an out of body experience. I am a true pepper head BUT I will NEVER eat another pepper x.
I need one to testing😍 i hope i can fast order seeds in Germany
There’s no flavor it just pain.
lol comes in later when your in pain lol 😂
10:20 you’re welcome
IN HEAT CHILI IN HEAAAAAAT
Klaus plays it up for the camera.. so annoying
"I'm in heat!"
Sean’s not that guy anymore
what kind of weak sauce stuff is that sean.. to not eat a whole pepper.. dude...... thats a massive let down.
YES, been waiting for Chili Klaus to make another appearance
Sean's little hand on the back bringing him to composure has my cold heart waaarmed.
That thing looks scary, I need it.
😂
Congrats Ed and team! So much effort and work has paid off!
Ain’t nothing but pain and hot poops. There is no flavor guys.
Had the chance to meet Ed at the pepper expo he’s a great guy to chat with
Tried a dragons breath pepper last week. It was flavourful and smelt delish. Then I died
so hints of tangerine, oak, and....pencil?
Klaus is breeding. LOL. Poor fellow is shifting dimensions
I always love Ed.  He’s so genuine and is all about the 🥵
Imagine Ed making his new RnD place in South or Southeast Asia.
Congratulations! It paid off man!!!!
I’M IN HEAT 🫠
Soon these peppers will be literally lethal.
Have to harvest early so no seeds
sean fell off.  How could u not join them and eat this new pepper fully.. cmon..
My god that pepper just looks dangerous
Can't be healthy.
maybe dude should invent toothbrushX next...
Ed described exponential, not logarithmic.  Taste IS logarithmic, so 2x the capsaicin won't taste 2x as hot.
Can’t wait to try Pepper X. Carolina Reaper is one of the most delicious things i’ve ever tasted.
So... Whats the limit the human body can withstand?! Because i honestly dont want to find out ☠️
Claus is breeding!😂
"Did you do that? Did you invent that pepper? WHY?" -Chili Klaus
Ed is clearly very desensitized to the heat from years of practice. But more than this, he surely has some innate genetic variation that causes his body to respond more weakly to the capsaicinoids, i.e. he feels less. Not to take away from his experience and training, but to be not only good at this but in fact among the best in the world, you must have some natural gifts.
Legendary
The very last "I'm in heat" as the video is about to end has me rollin 😂
I don't think Ed can even feel the spice at this point. He barely reacts.
I will only believe this when @the_johnnyscoville tries it. Guinness  records is a business so …
Me immediately: make the Guinness guy eat it
I love the flavor. I think there's some oak in it. And pencil. 🤣🤣🤣🥵
“It has no real throat burn like the reaper, but that comes on later when you’re in PAIN.” 😭😭
Did he steal this pepper from Troy, too?
I hope Rhett and Link eat it soon!
as a Sauce, I think Apollo still taste the best good combo of heat and flavor.
Is Klaus ok? Jeez? That might have ended his career lol
Nothing funnier than watching people explain good earthy flavors while looking like their being stabbed by satan himself
All celebs should watch THIS episode and see how much effort these geniuses put not only in creating the hottest pepper, creating the last dab and also Sean and the legend for tasting it once again, together.  If i was a celev invited i would put that last dab 2, 3 times in honor.
If I'm not mistaken isn't the Apollo pepper a cross between the reaper and pepper x?Also is it not hotter or just the Apollo sauce that is hotter?
Genetically modified pain lol
im sweating just watching them eat it. Congrats Smokin' Ed and team, cant wait to see the next infinity stone!
Grats Ed, now buy a tooth brush
Tastes like a Spicy pencil that makes you go into heat is quite a tagline for that pepper
Ed is the man
😅😰💦
I remember when I was in college we had a seminar on what makes food spicy. A food chemist described how originally the Scoville test involved someone tasting a pepper and then it was based on the amount of sugar water needed to make that taste dissipate. Crazy how much science in the realm of food chemistry has advanced. I don't even think it would have been humanly possible to verify a Scoville level above the 1 millions back then until the more advanced system was created.   It was fun, we had the choice to try a ghost pepper. Took me a few hours to get over that.
More Chili Klaus appearances please!
Wow speechless broh ........
More chili klaus pleaseeeeeee. ❤❤❤
How do you not love Ed after that response to the plaque and honor?  Would love love LOVE to get him on the Coarse Grind Podcast to tell his story!!
Had no idea the pepper biz was so high stakes.
Fake dramatic "reality" show stuff. c'mon
Am I the only one who heard you’re officially amazing🤔
When I ate the Reaper I said that was my limit....but now pepper X?? Not sure how the exit will turn out with this one😬🫨🤯
Seeing him so wholesomely delighted in their agony gave Gomez Adams vibes.
13:50 - Why?
Johnny Scoville will probably eat 5 in one sitting 😳😳
Imagine the monsters that guy has locked away still....
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Klaus is awesome that was genuine joy congratulations to everyone for being that brave
I have a question.  *Why.*
"I'd like to thank the academy, do i look just like taylor swift" im dead that was too good🤣
Ed is an alien.
Sounds just like cannabis
it looks so unappetizing 😕   also, i hope someone checks on klaus. buddy didnt look like he was having a great time 😂
Legends have it Klaus is still in heat to this day …
🔥🔥🔥🔥 Literally
Notes of oak and pencil. Yumm.
😂😂 I think there some oak in it😂😂
The passion for growing the hottest pepper!!  THATS WASSUP ED AND TEAM!!  CONGRATS!
“Do I look just like Taylor swift”. I love Ed so much, never change. Also no, you are way hotter
Ahhhh, the irony. 😏
So made up for Ed and his loyal team.
Eventually someone is going to breed a pepper 🌶️ that literally burns through your esophagus and kills you
Ed breaking up over his teams achievement shows just how passionate he is about his craft. Well done and congratulations Ed.
I’ve driven by Ed’s store PuckerButt everyday for years and had no idea how prolific he was up until yesterday 🤯
im like 97% sure i would just die. i cant handle red pepper flakes or cayenne
We need an aftermath video of this haha 🤣 Again high quality Shoutouts to the heat masters! 🤘🏻🌶️
Smokin' Ed Currie is the GOAT. Dude loves peppers more than most people love their first born.
Love chili klaus! 😅
“I’m in heat” 😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Are you ready for it ?
There is not a remote chance I'd do that to me. I like me. I'm my favorite me, the best one I have.
Thanks for the name, Now we all can remember this PEPPER ❌️.
IM IN HEAT
I just picked up a bottle and can’t wait to experience “I’m in heat”
I understand.
New way of tor*ure I wouldn’t want any part of 😂
6:30 hey Andy. Edd!    When you're on a first name basis with the world record adjudicator you know you already won your hobby
Masochists... all Masochists
Y’all should do an episode of eating hot wings in cold climate! Cold relieves the spicy! With a side of sweet maple  drink  to neutralize the pain!
I’m so proud of the FWF team, Ed Currie, Klaus, and the team behind Heatonist for this achievement. I’m crying about a pepper; not from eating one. Thank you guys for this video. It hit me right where I needed it. Keep up the good work. 🖤🫡
“I’m in…heat…” 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Good reminder Sean is indeed a human
Nobody with any sense would think the Scoville units would increase by increasing the volume, that would be like sed paint increasing the redness when you add more paint.
How does this man still have the same stomach 😂 ?
Congratulations....but was he crying because he knew it was got rip his intestines apart... or because his b][@!& was about to be ripped apart and then off...kicked in the dirt soaked in melted glass and then had a drop of sugar added just to be nice
Chili Klaus is such a legend
Chili Klaus is even tapping out after tasting one and Ed just standing there like he tasted something much stronger is making me worried 🤣
How many years has Sean taken off his own life?
I will never understand why you would eat something that gives you extreme pain.
Holy moly ed is an absolute tank
USA USA USA ………🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
It wouldn’t be possible to breed the worlds hottest peppers without the sheer bravado and passion for eating them as a lifestyle as Ed Currie does
That was funny.
Jalapeños are too hot for me !
Did i just watch someone die?
Shake shake it off...LOL!
Your editor did a bad job. Oh, well
We need a hot ones with Chili Klaus And Johnny Scoville together.
I need some seeds.
I'm in heat
Should have offered some to Nick from Guinness ;)
It is not just the going in but there is also the coming out the next day.
If Klaus is hurting like that us mortals would frigging die. That looks lethal.
The "Why?" at the end was hilarious. 🤟🤠👍
Can they make this into a self defense spray?
❤️‍🔥👊
💯 Woohoo!!!! 🎉 congrats!!! And Poor Chiliii 😭 I got worried! Love the video!!! Thanks Sean!
It's man made who cares...
Pepper X? Elon Musk would like to know your location.
I would have loved to see if David Blaine handle it lol
man what a great group of individuals, I feel like Klaus & Ed are such close friends
I want some seeds 😂😂😂
Another funny and interesting video. Would love to see you have the WWE Faction The Judgement Day on your wing eating show.
I’m in heat😂
I would do it with others around   LOL
Klaus was like “ I’m getting too old for this”
That dude said I'm in heat I started dying laughing
I want to see Sean interview Benjamin Netanyahu.
I thought pepper x came out a while ago? Am I the only one who feels like this already happened?
But that comes later when you’re in pain ☠️
Why is The king of pepper eating Johnny Scoville not present for this?
Nothing is secret not even those peppers 😒
This guy loves his peppers
I’m sorry “what we thought was the hottest “ does it get hotter ?!?!?
So...I guess the plan with spicy peppers is "keep making them hotter until someone literally dies, then we can stop"?
I want to see Spice King eat this pepper!
Watching them touch their faces and stuff after handling the pepper 🥵
Dude that's freaking awesome 😂!!!!
Fort Mill, SC  is so incredibly proud of Ed! I get excited and I feel a sense of pride that Puckerbutt Pepper Company is in our town!
We went from wine tasting to pepper tasting 🤔
Fantastic video lol 🤣✌🏻🔥
that guy is so goofy and weird
"I'm...I'm in ...heat..." This got me so hard😂
I think Ed should concentrate on growing a tooth brush lol
The pepper looks like it was pooped out
A proud son of Superior Carolina.
You guys need to have Lisa Nguyen on the show!
I have no idea why anyone would do this.
They should get Jared Keeso from Letterkenny for Hot Ones!
Not sure how much is in Ed's Gator Sauce, but it is really a great sauce with Pepper X.  Ed's the king, with yet another crown on his hot and spicy head
finally. it took what, 2 years?, for this pepper to finally get tested
That guy with the glasses is clearly not in good health. His gut biome is destroyed from the heat.
We need Klaus tshirts. I would have to smoke a carton of cigs after
Ed wins the Guinness World record and wins a chilli eating contest at the same time !👌
“It has no throat burn…that comes on later…when you’re in pain”  LOL epic
Remember. Hot in - hot out.
Looks like no fun, just self inflicted suffering  I wonder if any of these guys would eat one alone, no cameras  😂😂😂😂😂😂
They need to get Johnny Scoville in on this
“I think there’s some oak in iiiit” 😑 These guys are legends!!
10:35 for pepper x. youre welcome.
Dude this thing looks brutal I MUST HAVE IT!!!
Tried it the other day... It was GOOD!
God I love Klaus haha I wish him all the best
Can I buy seeds?
I love Ed
I’ve purchased hot sauces that have 5M+ Scoville scale but they weren’t hot for some reason.  The real peppers are much better
Gotta be much hotter than those Scandinavian cousins
Dude I hope they paid chili claus like 100k at least
I'm in heat... 😂
I think there’s some oak in it!… 🤣🤣🤣
It looks like the one thing you don’t eat when you land on an alien planet in a movie
This was easily THE BEST episode ever on First we feast.  I just laughed when Chili Klaus asked Ed "Did you do that, did you invent that pepper?" Ed "Yeah" Claus - "WHY?" ROFL!   Good job guys, Congratulation Ed!  "I'm in HEAT" LOLOLOL
Ed is a beast whoa boi😅
I love this so much. I'm a baby when it comes to spicy, I literally sweat watching all these videos, but it brings me so much joy! Sean you are always on point with your questions, and delivery. Ed, the silent moment you had with Sean when you got goosebumps gave me goosebumps. And then I started tearring up. Why???!
Just guys being dudes hahaha this is awesome. It’s cool to see how far Sean has come
Jesus...the way they describe them.... is it pepper or poison?
Ed's the gramps we never had
Congrats to Ed and his team. Looking forward to the next hottest pepper
Man I wish Johnny scoville could have been there! That would be so awesome!
That's not "your pepper", pepper is for everyone - at least every masochistic individual ;) Seriously: What a beautiful fruit, a work of art IMO!
Honestly Sean Evans looks like Walter white 😂
Congrats Ed. What content! Ed's breakdown amongst the suffering 😅😂
Such a awesome episode!!
I can barely handle spicy food, but I will watch an Ed episode every time. ❤
I want you to get pope Francis on here lol his mouth needs to get usto burning things
This was legit wholesome. Dude has pride for his team first, then their product. Good for him! May they all have many blessings upon their lives!  This was cool to watch. Thanks ❤
🔥🌶🔥🌶🔥🌶
That man who makes the peppers must not have any tastebuds left. LOL
Ed has a twisted mind. Lol  3:53
I swear bro fakes that he’s in pain 😂
If you didn’t know that they are those peppers and turned the sound off. You’d swear those guys were high.
Man the guy that made the pepper doesnt even flinch.
When Sean had such a vivid reaction to the sliver, it gives you more respect for Klaus eating a whole. Ed we all know is not human so his reaction doesn’t matter.
no thanks , a fresh reaper is for me close enough to death
Would love to see Chili Klaus vs Johnny Scoville in a pepper x eat off
So this is basically like SM, the release of endorphins in your brain.
He is the Frankenstein of peppers.
Did u invent that pepper, why?
Was hoping to see Johnny eat pepper x first. Been waiting a long time.
"I'm in heat" at the VERY end is so good 😂   And   "....why?!" Kills me
I love spicy food... but I ain't interested in a pepper that hot!
didn't eat a whole pepper with klaus. what a let down. you threw him under the bus and left everybody hanging.
Celebrities: why do i hear boss music?
i love you both! so fun to watch both of you eating these spiciest pepper 😂😂❤
Ordered some Monday, can't wait !
My glasses are fogging up just watching this.
That’s nuts.  I’m in pain just thinking about it
my man is in HEAT and you're laughing !!!
It doesnt even look like a pepper. It looks like poison. It looks like nature screaming, "DOnT EaT Me!!!!!"
That was amazing. Chilli Claus' reaction was magnificent!
That guy is not human.
I grew up down the block from Ed’s original home in ROCK HILL SC he used to have all kinds of exotic plants in his front yard and the back was a full garden didn’t know then that it was peppers and to think this pepper was being made and thought of is insane
I’ve had the tiniest little spec of reaper and it destroyed me, I can’t even imagine the pain klaus was in..
Man... smh... I love seeing people get emotional about their passions. I'm happy for Ed man.
still not hotter than NM green chille....
I fully believe the things millennials eat is the reason why colon cancer is on the upswing.
And the rest is history. 👀🌋🌋🌋🚬👍
I am in heat   Shake it off   Best ever😂
Ed is poetry in motion. very inspirational, if you love something go as high with it was you can.
Smokin' Ed!!!
Ed explaining whats happening to the guys is just like that scene out of Airplane.
"Why?"
Bless Ed for giving South Carolina the chance to be first in something besides STDs and low SAT scores.
I wonder how many people this will end up killing by accident....
I came here for the finger snaps. 😂
I'm no expert, but I would say when it comes to food, flavour should always come first...
This video warmed my heart 2.693 scoville units! Beautiful to see the joy of accomplishment. Thank you for this. For calling Guiness. For flying Klaus out. It’s all just lovely to see.
just like Taylor
Go team pepper x 🎉
Bonkerzzzzz!  That's a military grade chemical weapon and yall 4 just swallowed it.
I love home so much❤
I have eaten a full Carolina reaper pepper and I almost saw the pearly white gates for 2 hrs. I cannot imagine eating this pepper Jesus Christ (literally) 😂 congrats to Ed and the team
Flavor profile- pencil
I love that Ed is actually asking Klaus what the flavour is 😂😂😂
Shout out to Sean for eating that pepper and still doing his speech at the end without messing up
"WE"
He got the teeth of someone who eat peppers allday
Grabbing it with their bare fingers, that is so daring
Congrats Ed! All of you guys are nuts but I applaud your tenacity and grit! Keep up the great work! Chili Klaus and Cucumber Ed (as in "cool as a") great intro for Pepper X!
Surely ed also has a record for highest tolerance too
Im in heat.... Im in heat.... Chilli Klaus's famous last words.😂😂😂😂😂😂
Elon will sue for the "X" copyright xD
I'm in heat 😂😂😂😂😂
Ed handles it crazy well.
L.A. Beast needs to eat this pepper now!!!
Danes can eat spice like no other white people.
I need to see David Blaine eating these!!!!!!
So the Twitter pepper
I don't know any of these guys, but all seem like good dudes.  well done
What an honor to watch. Congratulations Ed and you all are amazing on this video. Great job.
W Chili Klaus
"We stabilized it..." not something u wanna hear eating a hot pepper😂
You had me at "come up".
9:29 It may be logarithmic but it's the opposite of what he said. I know he is excited about his pepper, congrats, but the higher it goes the ~less~ effect each Scoville has, not more.  A Jalepeno is about 5000 Scoville; a habenero is about 275,000. Is a haberno 55 times as painful as a jalepeno? No, that would put you in the hospital, and were not even talking about the millions.  All good fun though.
The ultimate question "Why?"
Should have had Guinness World Records Andy take a dab of hotsauce
Such great questions..
It's not avoidable Sean, you'll have to get Klaus back and both of you have a full pepper!
What I wanna know is, when is johnny Scoville gunna get one of these!!!!you all know he'd slay this pepper!!!!
Ed Currie is actually fireproof.
I been waiting for this vid since I heard the new pepper was out hahaha. Beaks to the wind boys.
Was hoping Klaus was going to talk about his hot ears again, but at least we got ''Oh no! Klaus is BREEDING'!'
Sean asks Ed about Pepper X and the first thing he says at 1:13 is....  "Well you know, we stabilized it"  Stabilized? Why TF is that even necessary?   It's gonna get to the point when these demented pepper sadists will have to include in their new pepper introductions, what's the half-life of these stomach bombs.
Congratulations on the Guinness record. You couldn't pay me to eat that chili 😂
Man, ketchup is too hot for me. Respect to these guys.
About time, I was wondering when this was gonna happen. We all knew that pepper x was hotter than the reaper.  Congrats, Smokin' Ed! :D
Violent and ever-growing 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Why does Pepper X look like a pepper taking a dump?
I have a feeling he’s got hotter peppers than the pepper x ready to go
Anyone that knows Ed's full story cant help but be immensely proud of him
Single best episode since the duo ate the Carolina Reapers together in the pub.
How do these homies prevent getting stomach ulcers? Good grief, their poor colons.
R.I.P. the studios’ plumbing.
Gotta love Smokin’ Ed and Chili!
What I wouldn’t give to see Taylor Swift do the Hot Ones Challenge. Would also love to see if she can bake using Pepper X and then have the team taste it!
Just when I thought Chili Klaus couldn’t top his “hotter than my Scandinavian cousin”, he pulls out the “I’m in heat”, and now I’ve gotten an ab workout from laughing so hard 😂
Ed is an absolute legend! Congratulations to him and his team! Now, time for his team to stabilize the pepper that outperforms Pepper X :)
Watched this a second time. To me there is something special to this ❤
This. This is frightening to me. I barely manage Apolo. I tried something higher/in between to test myself. But this. Oh boy ! Not sure if I can handle that...
Bro treating the pepper game like the mafia 😂
Chili Klaus, Chili Klaus, Chili Klaus!!! The episodes you two make are always epic! Together you lift the entire chili community
Even though I know why? I still ask myself, WHY???????
You should bring Mark Wiens to the table. He would love this!
Did you create that pepper? Why? 😂😂😂😂
Call it "dragonheart"
I'm almost positive that these same developers of this pepper are same people trying to convince women that they can take brutality
how Ed Currie can eat something like that totally unfazed is nothing short of superhuman. jeeeez.
Epic absolutely deserved well done!
Idk man I kinda feel like anything that needs to be "stabilized" shouldn't go in your mouth.
Ed sounds like Ben Stein lol
Why? 😂
There is not a more Genuine man on this earth than Ed
I don't think I've ever heard Klaus sound so confused and in pain as he did with that "why" 😂
So when a where can I buy either seeds or a plant to grow my own next summer??
Klaus is ovulating...lol
Please tell me its not female dog heat 12:32 LOL 😆
It’s nice to see this dude uncomfortable. 😂
I'm almost scared of this pepper
This is awesome congrats to Ed and the team!
Those new fake teeth look ridicilous.
Love it!!!
I've had Apollo...I felt like I was going to die. I have tried the other(except for da bomb) and none were near Apollo in terms of duration of the pain
Biggest Thief in the game.
Legends in the room
Currie’s insides are coated in an iron like substance. This dude’s dna is 45% spicy
Considering GWR's track record, I wouldn't be surprised if they confirmed this by forcing feeding peppers to live test subjects until they went comatose.
I sincerely hope Sean doesn't have health issues later in life from all the spice and scovilles that passed through his body.
A scorpion that’s gonna taste like shit
You know it’s hot if it’s named after Weapon X
and peeps eat these for pleasure they say lol
I didn't cry when Ed choked up! You cried!
I thought of you guys a soon as I heard about pepper X🤣
Wonder if he’s gonna breed the reaper with pepper x
Everyone looks like kids waiting in a doctors office
Ed is definitely a serial killer that hasn't been caught yet....
That thing looks like a hemorrhoid
"Did you do that, did you invent that pepper?" "Yeah" "... why?"  _gold. just gold!
“I’m in heeeeeeeeeeeeat”
I don't like anything spicier than sriracha but I love to join my 13 million brethren who all love the spice lords.
Ed’s story of brought him to making spicy peppers is amazing
what's the word on appolo pepper?  if this was a hybrid of pepper x and carolina reaper.. when will they officially come out with scoville rating?  Apollo sauce was not as hot as I expected so I'm very curious...
ed is the man
You guys are absolutely ridiculous. I'd rather smash my toes with a hammer on purpose.
Very cool moment to bring all the spicy bros together.  Congrats to Ed and his team for their achievements!  And always love seeing chili klaus!!!
i was convinced that it was a infected big toe from the thumbnail before i could see that it was Hot Ones
I can see Johnny Scoville own that bad boy like a pro. Can't wait to see him review Pepper X
🎉🎉🎉🎉
Get Johnny Scoville on your show!!
Ed going to Klaus' door on Halloween like "Trick or heat?"
I'm so high watching this at first I thought it was serious. It took me a minute to realize it's a skit or something 😂
WHY!?
I think Johnny Scoville said it best in his recent video "the world's hottest pepper is subjective to each individual and that Guinness World Records is a marketing company and Mr. Curry will have to pay Guinness yearly to retain that title until someone else comes along".
I got tear in my eyes. He have no reaction wth
I've always wondered what dusk tasted like.
"did you invent that pepper?"  "yea"  "why?"
I got a secondary high just watching them eat that 😂
Either chili Klaus has on High heels or you are All tiny ! I have met him a few times and he is the smallest danish man I have ever met 😅
Ed you inspired me to make my first hot sauce with carolina reapers and it came out awesome!
Enough to make a grown man cry. You sir have the respect of all my pepper eating ancestors 🫡🫡🫡🫡
smokin ed looks like 1 of those white guys who makes better mexican food than actual mexicans
Klaus for helvede...... Hatten af for dig !!
Surprised Sean "chickened" out like this. Dont get me wrong, I would not eat a sliver of any of the strongest peppers lol, but Klaus is stealing the show here. Ed is just on a different level altogether, so Im not surprised there.
Black pepper is too hot for me. This is mind boggling
Flavor? Personally I find the Carolina Reaper and the Scorpion to taste terrible. The ghost Pepper however is delicious.
Can confirm Ed is a cordial guy when the cameras aren’t watching too
I'm sure that Chili Klaus had a whole sentence describing the flavour and consistent of the fruit, up in his head ready to launch. But in that moment, it was all converted down to..... I'm in heat...... I'm in heat.... 😂😂😂
Could tell Ed was getting emotional. Good job sir! And thank you for bringing this pepper to the world despite me being too pathetic to ever try it.
„Did you do that, really, did you invent that pepper?“ „Yes“ „Whhhhhhhy?“
Why? Such a great question :)
I kept screaming at Klaus stop touching his eyes.
Is Ed even human?????? 🤣
Get Johnny Scoville this pepper ASAP
All the oxygen in my lungs left me at “I think there’s some oak in it..and…pencil” 😂😂😂😂
Why?😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hard pass
Congratulations  This is great History to witness
Congrats Ed! He sounds like a cartoon character, can’t work out which one though?
I am sweating just by watching the video
Mad respect for Ed and his team
i actually was sweating a bit just watching this madness
Who else ordered the Hot Ones Apollo Sauce?
You killed chilli on set
i want some of those seeds to grow
I wonder if you could make moonshine with this pepper
Should have been Lorde. She would have said "Hmm okay, tastes alright, kinda hot."
Chili Klaus is always so fun to see.. I love him... He's a champ amongst champ!
Thanks but no thanks, I want to keep my internals intact!
I started sweating just watching.  Good stuff.
I'm afraid to even scratch around my eye watching this.
Ed seems like such a cool down to earth guy.
Wow ive been dreaming about you guys meeting up for years! Chili Klaus opened my eyes to chillies and later on i found Ed and Mr Evans. All star of heat
ya know Guinness world records is a scam, you have to pay them to get the record
Just ordered my bottle 🔥🔥🔥💪🏾🥵
Didn't they just pull the last chip challenge for it potentially contributing to that kid's death? I do wonder about this on the same level...
Congrats to Ed for taking his passion and turning it into his life's work and accomplish such amazing feats
"I'm in heat!"
Klaus has become heat.
love you Chili Klaus <3. what a legend.
Did you event this pepper? Yes Why?  I would like to ask J. Robert Oppenheimer why did he invented the atomic weapon
The return of Chili Klaus!!! The world has been waiting for this!! We got to see him in heat.
I think we all got goosebumps with you Ed!! Congrats to a legend! 🔥🔥🔥🌶️🌶️🌶️🫑
Klaus:  "Did you do that?  Did you invent that pepper?"  Ed:  "Yeah."  Klaus:  "Why?"  comedy gold!
Can we get a welfare check on Chili Klaus?
The Puckerbutt Pepper Company is very close to my house. I've been there many times and I've spoken with Smokin' Ed Currie personally more than a few times.  We always have some hot sauces from Puckerbutt in my home. My sons all handle the heat.  Love that little shop.
My head started to sweat with you guys TALKING about it. I would die, 100%.
Disappointed Sean didn't eat the pepper but understandable:(
Boys in heat. Meow😅
"..Im in Heat..."
papa dont look so good, dont know ifi wanna be workin his diet
Ed is seriously the Einstein of Peppers. He needs the Nobel Prize next!
I'm sorry it's kinda embarrassing how Sean reacts to a single slice. Smh
CHILI KLAUS !!!!
Ed calmly talking.... while the rest are squirming in pain lol.
How hot is pepper x compared to the primotalii? Haven't had either pepper, but I'm currently growing primotalii's and t-rex yellows. They won't be producing fruit for another month or two, but I'm just curious.
The love <3
Were those peppers that they ate the real ones? The experts kept touching their eyes after handling them 🤔
"Do I look just like Taylor Swift?" "Shake shake it off.." 😂😂😂😂
Did you invent that ? : yes .............. Why ! .........
Klaus legit sounded like he was crying inside, taste some oak 😭😭😭 some pencil 😭😭😭       😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Was he about to cry or did he have flashbacks of hot pepper in his mouth?
How does Ed do that!
👏👏👏👏Congratulations Ed 🥳🥳🥳🥳
Can't believe Sean didn't do a whole one. Scandalous!
Yeah I think we’re going to pass on this thanks though!
The government is now raiding Ed's compound for his secret weapons.  Remember, we never saw the SR71 until there was a replacement.
This was amazing to watch. It is also incredible to see someone who has such a high spice tolerance be wrecked so bad by a new pepper. The creator of pepper X is an absolute beast. Eating that thing and just being chill.
This has NOTHING to do with taste...
He is a great example of a leader and not a boss.  He doesn't take the credit for himself.  He acknowledges everyone and the team effort. He chooses to use words like "we," not "I," and he has a team mindset.  Ed currie your awesome. Keep up the great work!
10:37 you’re welcome
You can't brainwash me that it taste good in any way.
Klaus clutching the table and barely breathing saying “I’m in heat!” is the funniest thing I’ve seen today.
Fool's!!!!
“I love the flavor,” he says painfully.
It's crazy to think that Ed created the 3 hottest peppers in the world and is always trying to make something hotter
dude if i ate that thing with my gastritis   id pass out and leave a giant star shaped sweat strain with brown at the middle
Who cares!!!!
Most peppers like alcohol is nasty.
If this has been sitting around for over a decade, it means the plant patent will expire in about ~7-10 years?
It was so sweet seeing Ed receive the world record! And seeing him get so genuinely excited to eat the peppers!
I don't even believe him that the "flavor comes second". His hot sauce is so unbelievably good.
Guys, thank you so much for sacrificing for us. You two are a blessing.
I got to meet Ed at a hot sauce festival in Illinois this year he is a very chill guy to talk to and I loved trying the sauces he brought to the festival
Official worl record pepper? Great! Where can i get one?
I'm in HEAT
If you have money your world record is safe👀
ITS very intersting... In my country we didint ever est spicy things. I dont understand all that world of spicy things
Looking forward to buying some pepper X sauce. Kind of.
Ed is not from this world. He is not a mere mortal. Good lord. Chili Claus’ reaction says it all and he’s a scholar with heat
Klaus "did you invent that pepper?" Ed "yeah" Klaus "why??" My favorite part🤣
10:36 - Skip the bullshitting and get to the pain... let's go boys!
Oak and Pencil ✏️😂
Insane, but so good, love this!
It’s been way too long since Chili Klaus has been here!!!!
You can tell they are not playing around and begging for the camera to stop rolling so they can roll on the floor and scream. 😂😂
I don't think it's gonna take long before people are going to try it
Chili klaus the 🐐
Wow! so cool! wow! :)
I'm barely 2 minutes in and I have to say thank you for this...
And what kind of culinary experience do you expect to bring to humanity? Pain and suffering, with a bit of a nice taste.
Awesome!! Love chilli klaus 😂
Man, I eat some pretty hot food, but if Klaus can't take that heat, then no, thank you, lol. I am good on that.
Ed is AWESOME!
Klauss: Ed did you really eat (or invent, couldn’t tell exactly what he said) that pepper?  Ed: Yes Klauss: with a tear in his eye, Why? I’m dead! 😂😂😂😂😂
I want to see David Blaine eat a pepper X
Never thought I'd see Chili Klaus tap out like that.
Ed is an absolute unhinged mad scientist in the best way
Feed Guinness World Records folks a pepper for every dollar they charge you! I bet they drop their rates!
Even jalapenos can make me hiccup uncontrollably. Not sure why anyone wants to experience anything hotter than that, except for entertainment value or bragging rights.
I have heartburn from watching this...
"Klaus is breeding" 🤣🤣🤣
I would die from heart failure and shock.
Klaus(dying): I’m in heat Ed(fine): Oh no klaus is breeding
The episodes with sean and klaus is funny but how can they top this one😀
Now please get your teeth fixed.
Ed is not human
Klaus : I'm in heat.......I'm in heat.......I'm done
Just heard you on the BBC - 5-Live Ed, you totally deserve this kind of international coverage. Passionate and driven guy. The King of Peppers.
Oh man this was so good 🤣🤣
"I like the way people look get really scared from eating my hot sauce" xD
Kudos gentleman. I ate a reaper once and I prayed for a quick death. Never again!
I teared up a little myself. This was so special to see.
Sorry to say this. Yes this may be the hottest pepper in the world, but the way this guy has patented the pepper and the seeds. I’m going to say may try it but not for a long time. I now live in Europe, and this tactic of greed and ignorance makes it hard for those that love hot food. Exciting and extremely disappointing. Pepper X I’m mad at you.
"I'm in heat"  🤣 These guys are insane. I wouldn't touch the reaper much less this one. Kudo's Ed and team!
So happy for them, and that they are right here where I live!!!
Are the official seeds available to buy?
real steep falloff from "Carolina Reaper" to *pEpPeR x*
Chili died that day
Awesomeness
Congrats to Ed and the team! Hope to grow these when they become available. The name makes more sense, now. Would love to hear what the proposed name is/was had the lawyers followed through.
Ed is not a mamal, he is a fckng LIZARD 😮😮😮
Congratulations Smokin Ed. Keep doin your thing
Did you do that, did you invent that pepper? "Yeah" why?
Can you imagine the hot snakes later
Ed may be an AI robot
Ed is so humble. This was awesome 👍. Good episode guys!!! Whoop! Props Klaus can't believe you are a whole one.  💯💯 y'all brave 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
How is this not instant stomach ulster?
If you don't make shirts that say "I'm in Heat" you're doing it wrong
I love this. Great job to everyone involved. I couldn't live without hot sauce at this point. ❤
"Klaus is breeding" 👁👄👁
Hahaha i love chili klaus, missed him so much 😂 That was a great episode
Men
You can hear the sheer terror in Sean's voice
It's so wholesome to see his emotional reaction to receiving the record. It makes me happy to see people being validated for their hard work.
can we all just take a moment to appreciate how many people are going transgender
Ed's a boss👍🏻
The worst I’ve ever done was eat a whole habanero pepper and the spice wore off rathe quickly and wasn’t actually that bad. I did it on an empty stomach and was trying to go with no milk however after an hour or so it caused so much stomach pain that I felt as if I’d given myself severe food poisoning and couldn’t do anything but lie in pain. With no end in sight I chugged a glass of milk and the pain was alleviated within 5 mins surprising how quickly I went from feeling absolute death to completely normal. Suffice to say if you want to challenge yourself with spicy peppers, always keep some sort of dairy on stand by 😂
Ed is THEE Scovillenaught
When Ed said that he loved seeing the fear in people’s the yes after eating his peppers, he straight up sounded like a serial killer 😂.
"I'm... In... Heat..." said my 🐩 too 😂
Whats scary is how the creator isnt twitching from his whole pepper he ate.
This was so fun to watch
Won’t be long now before Elon sues for calling it ‘X’
Ed has developed such a tolerance that he’s barely acknowledging the heat 😂
That pepper actually looks deadly😅😅😅 he said I'm in heat.
Yay <3
I will say this though lol that was an AWESOME episode. Keep up the amazing work!
If Sean ain’t eating it, you know it’s for real….
I gotta have one .... Looks intense
Hopefully this sauce will make him enough to afford to fix those teeth
Ed literally sounds identical to David Blaine if you close your eyes
You should do, Justin Bieber for hot ones no yes
Respect to Klaus
Why don’t ya talk to Troy Primoux? The reaper tastes like fossil fuel lol the x I’m sure isn’t gonna be all that either. Good job on the record though.  Let’s just be 100% honest the reaper didn’t taste good at all, I hope the X is better. Truth be known I’m a Primo fan. The pepper tastes batter, the hot sauce is better tasting. Good work Ed , to you and your team. I don’t hate ya I’m just a big fan of Troy. God bless !
This whole thing makes no sense at all to me 😂 why why why
Its a real Slugworth situation
It's always really wholesome to see people who are into farming/gardening go crazy with one specific type of plant  There's just something about f*cking around with seeds and dirt that feeds your soul.
Congrats Ed! Well done by you and your team!
Here comes the 2024 peper X paquai one chip challenge. 😂
Klaus: 🥵🤯😵😫 Ed:: 😐🫠🥱
Klause is my freaking hero for just taking that whole dang pepper
God is weeping as He knows I will use those to make fuel for aerosol dispensers to be used against other human beings.
That was really special... Congratulation Smokin' Ed!
Whose coming up w/ these new hot peppers?
Death has never looked so tasty.
I am looking forward to the availability of seeds. I loved Carolina Reaper and have grown a lot of it
Is there a point where it is TOO hot and becomes actually dangerous to consume?
Chilli Klaus is my favourite human
Straight outta SC lol😂😅
Klaus looks like he's about to die 😅
Very similar to a young Taylor Swift! 🤭❤
Warms the soul seeing people be so passionate about what they do.
I got a question. Can someone pass out from eating something too spicy? If so, has it happened?
This looks awful😂😂
Guinness World Records mean nothing.
This is awesome! Seen a video on this guy creating hot peppers a few months ago didn’t know he had this cookin!!!
10:45 of this video my mouth began to water. I know that look, I love heat. But there is just sometimes where you go past "I love hot" to just physically punishing yourself.
Elon Musk makes peppers now?
🤣🤣🤣👑🔥🚒🔥
My stomach would explode if i ate that 😂
Ed seems like a small guy. Not impressed.
I am sweating just by seeing this No lie!!!
It makes sense that the guy who created the hottest pepper in the world,  Is practically bulletproof when it comes to eating them lol
You only emotional reactions like this when someone devotes everything they have to something they truly love and need to succeed. Amazing work. My guts hope I never accidentally try it.
Chili Klaus is such a Riot, through all the pain he has the wherewithal to talk about the flavor. "I think there's some Oooak in it. And... Pencil" xD
Anyone else think Ed sounds exactly like Ben Stein? In fact he kinda looks a little bit like him too.
Yesterday I was talking to my wife about the episode when you and Klaus were burping away the pepper.  Coincidence? I think NOT! 🔥
Elon musk enters the chat
That's not food, that's medieval torture!
Come on Sean let’s see another episode when you eat the full pepper.
Ed casually explaining the experience 😅
when will @beardmeetsfood  try pepperX? He loves spicy food
Im in heat 😂😂😂
hahaha
But the chocolate primatoli is much hotter
WHY   ?
I am become heat
Lol Ed looks fine (I know he said he didn't feel fine). That's what had me laughing the most. Good job, team.
I love this episode. The guys explaining their process and the science made for such engaging content. I think you should have Paul Stammets on this show. I think he would be a great guest for this cross-section of your viewership.
This episode is on fire in so many ways 🔥 🔥 🔥
Wow
this is the content I'm here for. I remember him saying to his competitors they had 3 or 4 peppers already hotter than the Carolina Reaper to stay on top.
What's the point tho?
Love Sean's interviews and the people he does interview are great people, but you can see each of these men is a TRUE LEGEND, in their dedication to the craft. BEST episode ever!
My head started sweating watching this
That thing just looks alien lol
🤣🤣🤣🤭🤯🫠🤢🤮🤐
they really need to make a "I'm in heat" shirt
When the American and the Dane are on the same video together, you know it's going to be a blast!
Now Sean knows how it feels when the guest is dying and he's calmly asking a question 😂
13:00 that dude in the back like "bruh I might have just killed this guy"
A classic example of finding humor in the pain of others! Can't imagine what their morning BM the next day is gonna be like! Pain in, pain out! No open flames please!
Sean is hollow on the inside.
I think they broke Klaus...
love seeing people as passionate about their work as ed
I was today years old when I learned you can breed peppers and just make one up 😂
Congrats Ed & tram! The dedication to your passion really shows.
That’s pretty awesome to see his dreams come true. I don’t see Ed stopping his journey here, this is so cool to see his story that was a hardship that he has overcome and continue to make it positive.
Yes, yes, all good and well - but was it VERY TASTEFUL??! All snark aside: always great to see Chili, and mad respect for Sean.
Kakva lakrdija. Debelo plaćeno da bi bila najljuća paprika a u stvarnosti nije.
BEAST MODE!!!!
This goes amongst things you didn't know you were waiting for.
Breath like a dragon, shoot like a rocket!
Finally! All the hype for Pepper X for years and years. Its official! :D
Ah the finger snaps of the impending dopamine/endorphin dump. I almost want to try one. I’m sure the high is fantastic.
Lol yeah hard pass. I like spicy food and all but there's a point where it's not enjoyable or fun to eat. Makes the whole thing pretty pointless at the end of the day.
Chilli Klaus the boys are back. This is like Christmas for me
Hmm, do I want to take my chances with Pepper X or Ebola? I think I'll be safer with Ebola.
Bring David Goggins to the show!  "YOU DON'T KNOW ME SON!" *Proceeds drinking Da-Bomb
Oh what a glorious bear Chili Klaus has. I'm in awe.
Pepper X looks like something you would find in a very ripe diaper.
Ed forcing one tear to show he’s not an alien while Chili Klaus is just squeaking and gyrating in pain is a level of humor I didn’t yet know  existed
I did the One Chip Challenge a couple years ago and i felt like i was dying. Pepper X is double what that chip was. This is PURE INSANITY.
Nice to see it back. I haven't watched for a while. I think there was a guest that I hated and didn't watch/ stopped watching but now I can't remember who it was LOL
12:32 “I’m in heat” …..ohhhh no. 😂😂
"I'm In heat"
There's no way that you can taste anything after three seconds. It goes from 0 to pain so quick.
"I'm in heat.." -Chili Klaus
As a Dane, I think I might have deciphered the code: in Denmark you could say "Jeg er i brand" which word-for-word translates to "I'm in fire" (not "I'm on fire"), so I think that Pepper X probably just short circuited Claus' brain replacing the word "fire" with "heat" making it "I'm in heat"
Where can I get this hot sauce?! The website you're provided in your video brings me to a German website that has nothing to do with hot sauce
Wonder if he stole this from Troy Primo too
I am in heat too 😂 that was hilarious!!
Nice to see someone appreciate the process of creating this so much as Ed has. His emotions are further proof this isn't about the money, but more so sharing his passion with the world.
Chili: Did you do that? Did you invent that pepper? Ed: Yeah.. Chili: why? lol🤣🤣
Hot
10:38
Biological warfare 😂
"Im in heat" Chili Klaus for faen :D
"Did you invent that pepper?" "Yeah" ... "Why?"   💀
Stop touching your eyes, Klaus
Imagine making pepper spray out of pepper x your eyes would melt out ur skull 😂
Yuck Guinness World records, gross
That end "Did you invent that pepper?" "Yeah" "Why...?" was so good :D  What an amazing way to celebrate. Congratulations Ed!  You know its hot when Sean is tapping out and have to call for reinforcements in Chili Klaus xD
Did he say Oak and Pencil??? Legend
Chili Klaus in the Canadian tuxedo is the best.
I'm glad the Red Eyes guy finally found another use for his product
of internationally known Danish people, Klaus is a very cool one. "I'm in heat" 😆
with the color of the pepper id call it Goblin X
The fact that chili said he was in heat is amazing. I was thinking ‘this IS how they make more chili Claus’ !!
Huh, so it actually exists?
Nooo Sean left his brother in heat hanging 😅
The legend says Klaus is still out there walking, snapping his fingers.
13:51  "I did you that, you invent that pepper?" Yeah, "Why" 😂😂😂
CAN NOT WAIT!
i can only imagine Gordon Ramsay's reaction eating this! 😅 😅 😅
First they aren't the only ones to eat a whole pepper x.  I have.  Johnny scoville has eaten multiple at once.  Second they only believe pepper x is the hottest because they've never eaten a primotaili.  That's the true hottest pepper.
There is no way in the world you could pay me to eat that. Me and death would be the best friends.
The Pepper X looks so angry 😮😅
It can cure cancer
Chili Klaus and Sean must have some mean stomach ulcers or will get them soon 😬
Currie is such a beautiful personality.
I don’t know you Ed but I am so freaking ecstatic for you! Congratulations 🎉
i like how ed is so calm and unreactive while claus is withering in agony lol ed is built different
You need milk. Lawd!❤
Jalapenos are gross and too hot for me but the reapers are fruity right off the plant and their heat isnt near as bad for me and my youngest.  My wife and our oldest like jalapenos and hate super hots
Wait the Scoville is based on the water dilution? I swear I read it on a book ages ago that it was based on grains of sugar required to neutralize the heat.  Well, glad to rewrite that part of my mental archive.
Hearing Ed talk about the with he and his team put into Pepper x and his passion for it reminded me of the quote “if you do something you love, you’ll never work a day in your life” and you can tell he loves what he does by how proud he is
Congratulations! This was an historic event. Loved the reactions, and the love for peppers. Marvelous work, all of you.
You can just see how passionate Ed is about his craft. The emotion as he was given that award and talking about his team and all the work they all put in, that was pretty great.
Chili Klaus!! 💯💯💯💯🤘
What a moving video! Ed rules!
2 records were broken by Ed this day. How's he so calm after eating a full one? 😅😂
That was fun
The way he said was very douchy & full of himself  Saying this show is now vaild because of my pepper 😂
A friend of mine has a bottle of the last dab and I enjoy putting a few dabs of it on my burgers whenever we hang out. It hits hard but it's great experience
11:40 pepper’s so hot Klaus goes Jamaican
So u paid for the record because that's how you get into the Guinness world records these days
"I'm in heat." - Chili Klaus. Hahaha
HYPE
This is the greatest
BEST OF LUCK ANDY!! YOU'RE GONNA DO GREAT!
Who else was just waiting for the snapping as soon as they saw chili Klaus?
I teared up when he got the Guinness world record. Well deserved. ❤
I feel so bad for it coming out the other end on these guys
All the work he put in it you can see it in his face
You guys are seriously BONKERS !!
THE RETURN OF CHILI KLAUS
Seeing the emotion wash over him, when speaking of the hard work put in to make this pepper possible was the best. Congrats!
I wanna know when I can buy some of these pepper x seeds lol I LOVE growing these ultra HOT peppers
Sean Evans squinting the whole time makes him look like Sean Strickland😂 if you know you know
WHY?
Funny thing capcasin, the more u chew the hotter it gets. Same effect as an onion. Little diced onion in sauce hella stronger than a whole onion.
Try pepper X they said, it will be fine, they said... Chili Klaus is in pain, Sean is about to have an out of body experience, Ed shows he's done this before... Great show...
Where's MatPat
8:38 Literally
Awesome group of guys right there! The legends!
Don't miss the last clips of this video (as a Marvel fan I know to wait through the after text - same for this!!!)
Congratulations Ed, you can see the pure passion and how much it means for him. He deserves all the praise and respect he gets :)  Stakkels Klaus, håber du overlevet det, legende :)
I think I’m good
At this scoville level, you're basically just putting pure pain in your mouth.
“Did you do that?  Did you invent that pepper?” “Yes” “....why?”
Now I want to eat that one too. Yea, maybe (absolutely) I will be rolling on the floor in pain, but it looks so challenging! Also great job, massive work of Ed Currie and his team, my congrats!
I can’t wait to see Rhett and link from good mythical morning eat these
1,000,000 scovilles barely cracks a sweat, but a plaque brings on the tears.  What a guy.
We should start a Go Fund Me for Chili's GI tract.😂😂 I felt so bad for him watching this. We love you foreverKlaus ❤❤❤
This whole episode was amazing. Congrats to Ed and the team! Truly an inspirational accomplishment, and what a treat to see Klaus again!!
I have never seen Sean growing more afraid by the second as the pepper is brought up, nevermind Klaus straight up malfunctioning.
😂😂😂 “I think there’s some oak in it”
Good for them protecting their pepper crop. Need a great guard dog? I'll lease one out to you.👹
Finally Chili Klaus is back!
I presume you feel that 2.6 million again in a few hours?
😂 oc spray is 2000000 the pepper is literally a weapon!
....pencil...
Everyone dies Ed: "i think i have a tear in my eye"
Am in heat 🥵
Bro U have to eat a whole one.        Why did U only go for a tiny peace.        Chillie your the man.   Ed..... your twisted and I love it
Smokin Ed is some kind of cyborg. It’s like it does nothing to him.
Ed's about 3 new peppers away from advancing his pain tolerance to Wolverine levels.
My old head missed all these guys.
Where can I buy it!
When are gonna be able to get seeds?
I got problem breathing just watching this!
“I am in heat”😂
these hot peppers are literally melting Ed Currie's teeth
Sean chickening out
Ed Currie literally is just a crazy mad scientist who gets high off peppers lol
As much as I love you guys… The „experiencing“ the heat part is waaaaay to short😂😂😂❤❤❤
Would love for Sean and chili Klaus to try ice cream or something nice and chill 😊
CRAY CRAY
"I'M IN HEAT" Hehehehee. Chili Klaus always has the best reactions ... Never forgot "Its hotter than my danish cousins". :)
Ed being the most casual person while eating the pepper
Congrats to the king off peppers you deserve this.
You may have a murderer's row of spicy food legends...but, you ain't got the sheriff Johnny Scoville have you!  Stop flapping about and make it happen already!
"It kinda points people towards the flight response, instead of fight response, and then they get really scared.  I like the way people look when they get really scared from eating my hot sauce."   That dude in the middle is a sociopath!
Its the only pepper who gave a tear for Ed. Apart from that he has no reaction lol :D
i haven’t cracked up like this at a video in a long time tbh 😂
How does Ed no sell eating that pepper!? Like honestly how is he able to do that? I can't imagine what that guy's digestive track must look like
EXTREMELY RARE SEAN EVANS L!!!!! For not eating a whole pepper with his good friend Chili Klaus!!! ☹️☹️☹️
What sean eat is?
Chili Klaus is a global treasure!
Smokin Ed you deserve it. But I'm not gonna eat it. 😂😂😂
The intro alone got me really intrigued into the video.
I’m Mexican and I have a good tolerance I eat habernos now bcuz serranos don’t do anything to me no more , this looks easy I’d try it ,
So good to see Smokin' Ed and his crew get the recognition they deserve, and it's always a joy to see Chili Klaus, that man is adorable and must be protected at all costs.
I have been waiting years for this collaboration!!!
Just hearing how high the scoville is made me nauseous. 🤢 2,693,000 scoville. Why does this exist? Just doesn't make sense to me
I cannot handle spicy food, peppers, salsa, whatever. I would probably die if I did this.
Those things just look evil. All spiky, rough texture and a pointy head that just wants to pierce your tongue.
This was nothing short of AWESOMENESS!!
pepper x is the last dab? lol.. ps.. the hotter a pepper gets, it doesnt get hotter.. it gets sweeter.. remember that..
Ed is a master badass
YOU NEED TO HAVE MARK WIENS ON THIS CHALLENGE. HE LOVES HEAT. NOTHING HAD STOPPED HIM….. BRING  ON THE CHALLENGE
smokin hot...
At this point I think we need to start questioning “Has science gone too far?” I’m crying a little just watching this.
i just heard about this pepper today.. you already got a video out yesterday..
Congrats to Elon Musk!
Ed Currie Tha Dawg
you know, this pepper is so hot that even body reject it
Aw, you can tell this is a really special episode for Sean, Ed, and even Klaus! I feel it, too!
the more insane thing is this is the pepper ed was ok releasing. odds are he has like 3 more in his war chest the are being stabilized as we speak.
Yay Mr. Klaus!! What a legend. Always a pleasure to watch him.
Thats messed up man, make the old man eat the entire pepper while you eat a sliver, especially when your the host on a show for eating product made with those very peppers. Just messed upppp
Is there a scoville measurement on this pepper yet?
😮😮😮😮
I am 10000% trying this!!!! send me some and I'll make some salsa LOL
Ed with no reaction
Chili Klause! What a legend, his snaps put peppers to sleep 😂
"Pencil" and "I'm in heat." The reaction did not disappoint! Loved it hahah
11:04 the first and only thing/sound he really needed to utter lol
Did you invent that pepper?  Why? 😂
You're missing the one person that really needs to judge this pepper and that's Johnny Scoville
Ed ate that thing like it was a gummy bear
Going from "There are high corporations' willing to take what is not theirs..."  to "I like the way people look when they get scared eating my peppers'"...........there really is a fine line of things you want to share on the internet........
When the pepper is so hot that you have a strong desire to breed
Klaus: Did yo invent that paper?  Ed: yeah Klaus: Why?
here i am eating pickled jalapeños with my nose running 😅
Everyone: *Dying, writhing in pain, begging whatever God to make it stop* Ed: *A Monday*  Ed seems so genuinely cool
When chili said I’m in heat at the end was icing on the cake with the hilarious reaction
This is like the most wholesome thing I’ve ever seen, seriously
Congrats ed ! And just the hosting Charisma of Sean is unmatched . Never a boring episode all these seasons later if hot ones . Take a bow for yourself sir
Anyone else in the Hot Sauce - Guitar Venn Diagram overlap who wonders if Klaus and Danish Pete have been to the same family reunion?
Holy Jesus, Ed is BOSS
Is there an instant remedy for pepper? I know for sure milk dont work. Best thing i had so far is aloe vera drink, but i have never had anything of that spice level.
I would love to see a  live thermal imaging of these guys after they ate this.
Ed has passion that some can only dream of.
Do you think we are straying into a point where these should now be classified as weapons? Weapons of toilet destruction, heyoooo. 😎
Congratz to Ed and his crew! I have in the past bought his Carolina Reaper seeds and we have grown our own. Now I'll be looking forward to getting my hands on the Pepper X seeds. What do we do with them people ask? I make my own hot sauce. Not for sale, just for the burn!
Wow dude. Major congratulations to Ed n the entire team!!! Props to Claus for bein such a monster.
That’s gotta do a number on the colon later on
"Im not crying. Its just a reaaally hot pepper"
Just ordered a bottle of The Experience!
Every time they said "pepper x" I was thinking "pepper ann" and now the theme song is stuck in my head.
10:35 thank me later
I think I would die if I ate that.
As a pepper grower like ed and even have Carolina reapers, super happy for ed and his pepper x. I have eaten Carolina reapers and can't imagine anything hotter than them
😂 I'm in Heat!
Watch out, Elon is going to sue you for calling it X.
😂I'm in heat!" I haven't laughed that hard in a while 🤣
Here I am barely able to handle a ghost pepper burrito good lord imagine
I am so glad that pepper x has succeeded the Carolina Reaper. There have been many peppers throughout the years that would have dethroned the Carolina Reaper unfortunately the most difficult thing to do in creating a super hot is stabilizing it. I remember the chocolate bhutlah a pepper significantly hotter at the time than a Carolina Reaper but unfortunately it could not be stabilized.
This is impressive that you understand the dilution factors. Congratulations are in order🏆🍶🏁
Congrats Smokin Ed. You deserve it! I can't wait to grow the pepper X.
Chill dudes😭🌶🔥💀🔥🤒🤕🤑🤐🙃🙄🤓🤖🤧🖤
Reaper is honestly one of my favorite flavor wise. A fresh reaper sliced into thin slices on top of just about anything. Nuclear candy
Ed just made Sean look like Gordon Ramsay lol. Unbothered. 🌶️🔥
That pepper LOOKS evil!
Mama Liz’s chili oil
I want some PepperX xtract😅 for reals
Still haven't cracked my bottle yet, can't wait to try this one!
Klaus touching is face so much had me nervous
people who are masters of random trades are always so wierd 😂
I love that Ed has even hotter peppers than X in his spice box
Oh come on! You should have at least showed a clip of 20 minutes later at the end. I have a feeling that was a rough day.
😂😂😂 this may be Chilli Klaus's last appearance 😂😂😂
This kind of parallels with AI research. Spicy pepper folks will keep pushing heat levels until they're fatal and AI researchers will keep going until they create Skynet.
Klaus, you truly are team player n warrior !!  The 2nd man in the world to eat the whole pepper other then Ed, well done Sir. 👍👍  A massive Congratulations to you Ed n to your team, your a real Master at your craft by far. Well Deserved !!..   With all do respect though, I'll never eat those peppers sadly.. 🙃
God I can’t stand how u guys give the reactions away in the beginning! Like why?!?!?! Just save it we know there are gonna be good reactions! COME ON
That thing looks like Shrek's earwax Yum
I can see how this could be comparable to a insane trip. They look like they’re going through a Ayahuasca trip
Way to go ed! Thanks for adding a new experience to the world!
Ed is a freak of nature.
Bravo boys…bravo! 👏🏼👏🏼
It's a joke when they talk about the peppers tasting good.
Ed deserved it. ❤
Pepper X. It continues... 🔥🔥
A new king is throned!!! 🔥🔥🔥🌶️🌶️🌶️
Can we please get Roger from "The Hot Dang Show" as a guest?    Also, congratulations to these guys hard work making Guinness book of world records
now mail some to Rhett and Link lol  we need more content lol
Pheno hunting peppers is like pheno hunting cannabis plants I love it
I hear Pepper X is how you turn the PowerPuff Girls into the Spice Girls.
Ed you have changed.  You named the peppers hp for higher power but you don't follow the bible.  You are sueing your brothers and sisters over seeds God's creation not yours.   You work for money not God
Mad respect to Eddie for his impressive green thumb and not letting anyone get their hands on his peppers!
Bring in Johnny Scoville. @ChaseTheHeat YouTube
Guinness is a joke
Ok....now eat a Chocolate Primotalii pepper
Ed, you're much "hotter 🌶" than Taylor Swift
It’s the sequel we all dreamed of
I will Now call my little friend “pepperX” in winter. Since it looks like a shriveled up wee wee😂
David Blaine needs to do this again with pepper x
Elon Musk might buy the rights to this Pepper "X" 😂
They all have the same flat eyes. Idk why that stuck out to me. 😂
RIP Chili Klaus, lol <3
When Ed gets the plaque the first words out of his mouth were in recognition of the team that helped him get there. That guy is a true leader, and that is the reason they continue to reach greatness. Congratulations!
I was wondering why Pepper X wasn't available in supermarkets, or just seeds for grow it yourselfers. Now I know why. Can't blame the guy, power to him!
South Carolina, baby! Well done, Smokin Ed!
You guys are all NUTS!!  Haha
Watching how much he touched his face after handling that pepper made me nervous for his eyes...
It wasn't a matter of if Smokin' Ed would be on Hot Ones, only when
I know Ed has admitted repeatedly that he's addicted to the feeling the peppers given. This is fine but he's just standing there so chill and on the other side of the those two are just losing it. 😂😂😂😂
Klaus is a hero😂
Chili Klaus "I'm in heat" and Sean laughing in pain, was more than I could take! I laughed so hard, I cried!!!! Way to go guys!!!!
Oh no Klaus is breeding
Who's Smokin Ed's friends? Magneto? Hannibal lectre? Godzilla?  I'm saying he's super villain. He's a gosh dang super  villain😂😂😂😂
These men are all such sweethearts. Congratulations and well-deserved!
Ed is such a dedicated dude. Kudos man.
I thought Chili Klaus was going to pass out for sure!
Congratulations ED!!!!!!
Ed is legend. Super congrats!
"Did you invent this?" "Yes." "Why?" *dying slowly*  🤣🤣🤣
"I'm in heat" 😂😂😂
Smokin' Ed is just standing there like, "Really, it's not even that hot."
Missed opportunity to have David Blaine absolutely tank pepper x
Congrats Ed!!
Wow.  I did not expect his reaction to that world record.  That man is passionate about his peppers.
❤❤❤
Had Carolina Reaper chicken tender just today. One day after it lost the title of hottest pepper
This is by far one of the best episodes I've seen. I love this guy.
When you have a passion that others can respect. You feel nothing but love and joy for this accolade. Keep those peppers growing.
"Let's watch 3 guys torture themselves."  Congrats Ed. A record well earned.
It looks like Satan's hemorrhoid.
Nope.
This just means he's created a hotter pepper than pepper x that he'll now keep in the war chest.
Woulda loved to Sean eat a whole pepper😢😂
Incredible as I open my fridge and look at my 2 Carolina reapers that I have left! Now I want one of those. Congratulations Ed you truly deserve the best. 🌶️
I had to eat a bottle of rolaids just watching this
Super congrats to Ed and all those who have stood with him!   You freaking rock!!
In the same year that Oppenheimer releases; the WORLD WILL NEVER BE THE SAME 😮
It looks like amateurs on the left verses experts on the right 😂😂😂😂😂
Ed Currie is a fukin beast
Ed is one scary dude.
YES
Klaus visited the volcano. Ed lives in it.
Ed, every Chef around the world tips our hats to you brotha
I am so excited!
Ed is a very gracious winner. Good for him.
It has no real throat burn like the reaper. But that comes on later when you are in pain. :D
So it's not deadly
When I first read “pepper x”, I was like “what did Elon do now? “🤦🏻‍♂️
Someone's gonna die eating one of these, right?
That thing is going to leave a helluva exit wound....lol
Congratulations Ed, fantastic work, keep it up and wonder how much hotter the pepper can go.
Klaus is a champ!
Ed's a mutant.
His last pepper is hot but tastes like shat, hopefully this one is not as disgusting in taste.
We need to see a behind the scenes
I loved how he had to show off the goosebumps to Sean. ❤
Thats passion
Done put Claus into submission 😆
That's Ed's baby so apparently it can't hurt him
Awesome. Congratulations! Can’t wait to buy one soon Down Under! 🇦🇺 It looks spiky and prickly. lol
We love and live for all things FirstWeFeast and Chilli Klaus.
Ed is a maniac
0:36 "...who needs no introduction." 0:38 *introduces them*
I'm buying a bottle!
“I’m in….. I’M IN…….. I’M IN HEAT!!!”
How does this sauce compare to Da Bomb?
"It has no real throat burn like the Reaper, but THAT comes on later when you're in pain."  He says while everyone is only 15 seconds into eating a Pepper X and complaining of chest heat and no throat heat.
Chili Klaus is so funny
Oh no!  They killed Chili Klaus!
Ed seems like such a cool dude, really loves his craft
Everyone is dying and then there’s Ed.. “I gotta little tear in my eye.” 😅
No way would I ever try that. Good lord. 😂😢😅😂
I'm a simple man, I see Chili Klaus ans Sean Evans on the thumbnail, I click.
Congratulations to you and your Team,  it was finding puckerbutt that's caused me to go from mild to wild, but  don't think it will be pepper X wild. Rite-on Bro. Well deserved.
Chili Klaus is the best .... Sean tapping out .... disappointing.
I drank the while bottle of Pepper X Xperience and it was no fun! Dang it Ed!
Can't wait to try this new record breaker.Congrats Ed.Good job Sean Much love from a chilli freak in the UK
I'm kind of sad I feel like Sean kind of left chili Klaus hanging
Ed getting emotional when talking about the team 😢 how sweet
Did they live?
I like chilis but, I have to ask also:  WHY? How does actually enjoy this pepper?
Cannot believe the spice legends converge once again! This is a meeting of the century!
KLAUS! yooooooooooo that vid in the bar with Sean was one of the first I ever saw on Hot Ones! Get these guys on a delightful sleigh ride again!
So in other words it gives you anxiety attacks when eating these peppers 😅
"Did you invent that chilli?" "Yes." "Why?"
This is the Avengers Endgame of hot chili peppers.
as a hot ones OG, we are gonna be looking back on this video just like we still do with the first video of you and klaus. heres to another 10+ years of hot ones!
Поздравляю Эдда, с новым достижением!  Прошлого рекордсмена, Каролинского жнеца, просто обожаю, в любых проявлениях, от соусов, до свежака. Спасибо великому селекционеру за рипера! Хочу попробовать и этот перец!
I'm genuinely concerned for Chilly.
Oh no clause is breeding. 😂😂😂😂😂
Ed is an evil evil man haha
Fake news.  :)
Chili Klaus looked major hurting, he's ok?
I look forward to adding a dab of a pepper x sauce to a batch of chili...if I ever made a batch the size of an Olympic swimming pool.
👍🏻
I want to see David Blaine take this one on
Guinness guy should have tried it too! That would have been the cherry on top for this video! Congrats Ed!!
Ed Currie eats the hottest peppers in the world: no reaction Ed Currie accepts the Guiness plaque for the hottest pepper in the world: nearly cries
Chocolate Primotali is still hotter
"I'm in heat!" "Shake, shake it off"
Ed is the heat got apparently
Ed Curie is not of this world...
This filled me with such joy to just see four guys getting emotional about chili peppers.
I'm so happy for Smokin Ed, he seems like a really genuine guy, and his reaction was so heartwarming had me tearing up with him fr
Congrats Ed!
Congratulation Ed and team! Amazing :)
Great video
Great job Ed! Keep it moving!
Thank you for your suffering for our entertainment. Klaus makes some of the best faces when he's really feeling it. 😆
Elon Musks favourite pepper
Chili Klaus "I'm in heat" Sean Evans "Heaven?" Chili Klaus "I'm in heat"  I absolutely lost it at this point.
Elon will buy it
Ed currie is a insane lad.. Taking that pepper like it's nothing
Maybe Pepper X should be considered a bioweapon!
9:48
Love these dudes. We must protect them and their peppers.
- im in heat. you broke chili klaus... newer thought id se that happen.
Ed is a madman 😂😂
"Did you invent that pepper?" "Yeah!" "WHY?"  Seriously, that's a great question. I think he's just trying to perfect his 100% organic pesticide :D   Also, Ed Currie just comes across as a guy doing what he loves to do. Everything else is just details, and it shows.
It just looks more evil than any other pepper I've seen.
ive read headlines today about pepper x. OF COURSE Hot Ones is lampooning the effort with a PEPPER-X SPECIAL. Exceptional.
Ed is a boss
Dude Ed is next level.... wasnt even phased
When you cry more from the award than from eating the Pepper X.  You know it means a lot to the man.  Respect…
Love Sean and Klaus. What's not to like?! Hah!!!
Hot food NOT enjoyable at all 🛑
love you guys
Chili Klaus! Woohoo! And the Great Ed Currie! Congratulations🎉
I still find it unbelievable that Ed and these peppers are from my small town!! 😂
Uh oh, Klaus is breeding 🤷🏼‍♂️
Hahahahahaha Awesome video guys!
Yous guys rule
This guy made the carolina reaper......then got bored and beat his own record.
Soo... can we get Ed on hot ones?? Seems like a Genuine interesting guy !
'Do I look just like taylor swift?' ok I officially LOVE this man!
HAHAHA IM IN HEAT IN HEAT IN HEAT!
King of spice one liners LOL. "hotter than my scandanavian cousins", "I'm in heat" 😂🤣👍👌
And Ed doesn’t blink an eye when eating these!!
Man just swallowed a live grenade and got asked “how’s the flavour?” Hahaha
Klaus is up for the task!
A bottle of the pepper x was sent to me like 6 months ago. I haven’t experienced anything hotter in my life.
Love seeing Chili klause, took it like a super soldier  I salute you all cause I wouldn’t eat that pepper
Pepper X is officially the hottest pepper 4hours ago
Too bad none of those hot sauces are naturally organic.
Waiting for Johnny Scoville reaction!!!
Did I mishear when he said, “we STABILIZED it.” Like does this pepper have nuclear qualities!?
Grats Ed
I didn't expected to cry watching some guy who created this "evil" pepper, but here I am
Looks fun…..
Smokin ed, should rename himself to "mad scientist"
Why that dude keep his mouth open like 😮
should have showed more longer.
Yes Ed you do look just like Taylor swift 🤣
did sean eat one?
The board of me has considered this proposal and has concluded that I will not be trying this
Only hot ones video I give a f about congrats and good job to the entire team
Klaus bro what flavour?😂 It must taste like death💀
Can you buy this sauce anywhere?
Congratulations Ed all his team 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
I love how Ed made the single hottest thing on the planet and then goes meh I can do better, then proceeds to do just that. Absolute mad lad
introducing: Zyklon B. its the hottest pepper known to mankind! also known as poison gas!
My man spoke like he won the Super Bowl but gotta love it, mans passionate 😂
We shouldn't be giving mad scientists respect for crimes against humanity!😂
Love this team for creating this video, and especially Ed and his team for this creation, let's not forget Chili Klaus is awesome as well!
I love chili Klaus hahaha
Each time I see a video or story about this, I ask the same question in the opening.  WWWHHYYYY!!!
“I love the the look when people get scared after eating my peppers”
Poor Chili, he got it the worst somehow.
Waiting for pepper x on Chase the Heat…
Sean not eating is us so sad. It’s not that much worse the a Carolina reaper.  Lame. Be better it a whole one in another vid I would…….
When i finally bought and  wanted to try world hottest pepper - Carolina Reaper - you decided to released this monster. Thanks guys :/  Just kidding, congrats!
Pepper x Just read about this an hr ago 3x times hotter the reaper
Chili Klaus is the best!
‘I’m in heat’ 😂😂😂
hahaha
I'm surprised no one died.
Lets be honest, these things don't have flavor - they just scorch your mouth.
I realized right after that I wouldn't even touch my own eyes while I was watching this video 🤣🤣🤣
Congratulations ed Currie I'm glad you made hotter then the Carolina reaper I was the person that messaged you 8 years ago to make hotter and you haven't failed what a legend you are
Congratulations!!!
This farmer is legit a modern mad scientist
GD Ed is the man. No tears for the pepper but plenty for the award.
I would have to drink milk after just smelling it.
What are you people doing to poor Chili Klaus
Now, bring on David Blaine. 🥶
Let's goooooo congratulations People!!!
I've eaten a Reaper. I think I'll skip out on the X.
skip to 10:00
I'm in heat. Had me rolling
Haha nutters, true respect
A "Murderer's Row" would include Johnny Scoville who wouldn't even flinch at Pepper X.
Klaus is so happy he is even crying 😭😭😭😭
Just ordered a bottle of
Ive never see Chili Klaus react so painfully. He was in such trouble haha. But hes the man! IM IN HEAT!
Thank you Ed for introducing us to some of the hottest peppers in the world. Me and my dad have a Carolina Reaper bush that produces some of the most beautiful red reapers and that’s because of you. Knowing pepper x is so much hotter than the reaper, I think I’ll leave this one alone Ed 😂. Watching Ed eat that pepper and not bat an eye, LEGEND!!! Ordered me a bottle of the sauce also.
ED?! NOAH?! ARE YOU GUYS OKAY?!
7:15 you're getting people through a lot of different emotions, here, on First We Feast! ♥ Congratulations for the Record, well deserved! 🔥
Our Local news had a story on Smokin’ Ed ❤️ 🌶️
WHy didnt sean eat a whole pepper ? Kinda lame
Elon Musks lawyers are calling
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 😂😂😂
Pepper X needs to be the last last dab!
"I'm in heat" may be the funniest thing I've heard and watched.
Fucken Gold
Ed took that pepper like it was nothing!
Jus fir fun Ed Currie reminds me of an old man Pastrana 😮
*Return of the Klaus*
Hopefully we get to see the wings sauce of Pepper X and The Mississippi Queen.
Well deserved Ed and great job everyone who put his product out there and hot ones for giving us great content!
The pepper God
Congrats!  And man i Love Klaus........*snipping earlobe´s"
Best one ever! Poor Klaus!
that man is pure evil.  😂
K L A U S I S B R E E D I N G
13:42 I love Ed
In before Guinness accidentally sues the video for copyright infringement.
How much did the adjudicator cost?
My buttholes burning already😂
Two words: weaponized "food".
😂
I appreciate Chili Klaus' honest and humble reaction. Hot is hot! If it isn't hot for u, then u are simply gifted with faaar lesser capsaicin  receptors.
The irony of him keeping the pods/seeds locked up😂 if you know you know
Let's take a moment to appreciate that Ed is a multi-millionaire but you wouldn't know that by looking at him. He's kept his roots!
Andy bodied that pepper
Lawndog would be proud
I hate that 95% of people think the Carolina Reaper is the hottest pepper in the world
Why didn't Sean eat a whole pepper?
can someone ask ed currie,  does his huge intake of hot peppers combat colds and flues, ? are bugs etc able to even grown in his system , I have a theory hot spicy food keeps cold and flue at bay but keen to discuss more, haha
The im in heat blip at the end credits killed me, im wheezin
You guys must hate yourselves to eat such impossibly hot things. :D
Jeg tvivler på om Chili Klaus ved hvad "in heat" betyder, haha
It was so hot Klaus changed species for a moment.
More Ed!!
Not saying this isn't the hottest pepper, but people should stop enabling guinness scammers.
Petition for to nominate Lukedidthat to try Pepper X to see his reaction 🥵
Did the Apollo sauce ever get a scoville rating?
“I’m not gonna hurt you Klaus” LYING IS A SIN ED
Did you invent that pepper? Yeah! why!!!
Honestly the emotion from ed shows how much he views his life work. Just amazing
Hahaha the "I'm in heat"-thing makes so much more sense in Danish, but is lost in translation. He's not in heat, he's in a hot place. He's hot.
That's not Smokey Ed - that's Special Ed 😂
'murica baby
A very special day were I'm very proud to be Danisch 🇩🇰 Congratulations Ed 👌👍🙏
They need to get Johnny Scoville on here!
Man Chili Klaus is such a champ. Standing next to Ed to have eaten a whole pepper x while the other two just ate a slice, you can really feel Ed had loads of respect.
My granddaughter just texted me and she wants a bottle. She is not human- last puckerbutt bottle got her to finally grimace. Her dad and I were crying in pain
Congrats ed
Wait, Sean didnt eat a whole one? Why!?!?
Chili Klaus is an absolute legend
Congratulations, Smoking Ed and team!
Is broier a word? Anyways, it doesn't get any bro'ier than this. Love these guys! ❤️
Chili Klaus ist the best.
Me & the boys do the same cheers ritual before we eat shrooms
The “I’m in heat” killed me 😂😂😂😂😂😂 I couldn’t stop laughing at your pain guys… sorry ? 😂😂😅
12:12 got me too good 🤣the way he says "that comes later when your in 𝖕𝖆𝖎𝖓"
God Ed!
“Did you invent that pepper?”  “Yea” (dying on inside) “why”
That pepper LOOKS evil.
"I love the flavor. There's some oak in there,  and...pencil."
They should of made it longer, we love seeing santa cry😂
The greatest respect Ed. Well done. I was  thinking tho... Pepper X (= Pepperex = pepper rex = pepper T rex) You could make an awesome label with the head of a T-rex? I like that... Anyway goodjob Ed, 5 years till the next one, cant wait
Chili Klaus: “I’m in heat” Sean: “Heaven?” Chili Klaus: I’M IN HEAT”
Ed didn’t even react. That guy is a beast
I love when Ed comes on. He’s the best and doesn’t hide it when it hits him.
Ed mentions the Scoville scale being logarithmic, and that it’s 3x as hot as the previous pepper. That’d be exponential.  The Scoville scale is chemically a linear scale, however, by perception it's more like a log scale. Tolerance builds logarithmically, which flattens out dramatically.  Regardless… too hot for me 😅.
Pepper x and professor x epic video lol
What's the point of making a pepper that causes body pain for hours, not to mention any internal damage it does over time?  There are easier ways to get an endorphin release - like physical exercise.
we're already crying and havent even tasted the pepper yet
So silly. Flavour....shut up! It was created to destroy people on YouTube and make money out of it.
When can I buy seeds?
I was afraid getting my fingers near to my eyes after watching this  you can really feel the heat klaus is in lol
Ed is the Joey Diaz of peppers
Some people just want to see the world burn...out of both ends.
new world's hottest chili just dropped, and yet da bomb still feels hotter 🤣
Oh man, this was great! Tasting that devil pepper with its creator and Chili Claus too.....big fun! 😆
Pretty sure curry stole the chocolate butlah prob made this out of it
I’ve been waiting for this moment for a long time
Can you make Pepper X pepper spray 🚓
MY NEW FAVORITE  EPISOPE
It's kinda cold of ya to only eat a sliver and hand your guest an entire pepper... 😅😂 🔥
Lol awesome 😊
I'd love to see David Blaine eat one of these, he was one of the very few to not even blink even after eating a wing with Da Bomb sauce on it! And ate a raw reaper also with no reaction!
You guys are crazy man, no way would I try it lol
We lover of spicy foods gotta come to this video atleast once
Can't believe Smokin' Ed dethroned Tommy Tallarico for this record
Look at smoking Ed taking it like a champ!
That was magical.
Y hasnt the Primotalii been tested?
"I'm on the edge of my seat". Lowest IQ Sean statement?
Ed Currie is a demon lord isekai'd to Earth to create the world's hottest peppers.  "I was a Demon Lord Slain By The Hero in Another World and now I am on Earth using an S tier pepper growing cheat skill."
These things (Carolina reaper, trinidad scorpion and now X) arent "spicy hot"- its more like "chemical acid burns"
Serious props to Sean for somehow rallying enough mental faculties at the end to do the outro.🤣
Man, to see chili struggle is enough for me to say, no thank you.
No freakin' way! Not for a dime less than $100.00 !
We need to get Rhett and Link to eat this now 😂
I need to try this pepper it looks delicious
Love it! LoL! You guys are awesome. Congratulations on the world hottest pepper! Lol!
love this guy.
This is the most wholesome and fantastic video. Ever. Geniuses and heroes all together! Congratulations Ed and company!
Smokin' Ed Currie should receive another world record of eating the Pepper X without reacting to it.
Sissies! All y'all.
One has to wonder, has mans hubris gone too far?
Lol, lots of good laughs. I imagine the next bathroom run would be great entertainment too😅
Ed currie eats raw jalapeños to cool down
Sean went from normal @10:58 to bright red @11:03 REAL QUICK lol
Ed is a Master Craftsman. You can see the passion for what he does
Ed made a follow up video describing the horrible after effects... Id love to know how Chili Klaus faired after the cameras stopped. Looked very uncomfortable lol. Gongrats to Ed on the Guiness Record, that was very sweet of you Sean to facilitate that and I dont think anyone blames you for not eating a whole pepper.
Sean: 🥵 Klauss: 🤯 Ed: 🗿
I want to see the behind the scenes for the next 6 hours of following them around.
finally sean breaks his calm face while the pepper beats his nerves and taste buds
When Klaus starts snapping you know it is bad.
These dudes are such sadists & masochists 😂
hilarous
Eds tongue must be DEAD!!!! No way on this green earth im trying one of those!!
Ed, did you invent this pepper?  Why?!?!?!    - Greatest moment ever!
This has such classic hot ones vibes lol. Klaus and Sean are a hilarious duo
Has to be hot to put a man in heat
Respekt Ed 😊❤
This is the best episode that First We Feast has ever released! Thank you for sharing this with the world. If I didn't live in Mexico I would be buying Last Dab Xperience this very moment!
So funny the contrast between the Danish guy and Ed
Pepper X made by ELON MUSK?
Im in...... heat 😢😢
11:38
In an article I read yesterday Ed said he felt the heat for over 3 hours, followed by horrible cramps, followed by lying flat on his back outside in the rain groaning in pain for an hour.  He also hinted that he already has something hotter than this in the works.
This will make for an excellent torture technique... force feeding Pepper X's down someone's throat.
Got a little bit misty-eyed myself watching Ed react to receiving the official Guinness World Records plaque. Such a stand up guy, so passionate about his craft. Great work Ed and team, looking forward to what you produce ten years from now!
Send some to YouTuber “Uncle Shane”
10:09 that’s what sweating bullets looks like 😂 🌶️🤯🫠☠️
I am so ELATED for Smokin' Ed! Every man (,woman, etc) deserves to achieve their dreams and REAP (*wink*) what they sow and are entitled the FRUITS of their labor. Today Smokin' Ed got the recognition for thousands of hours of blood sweat and tears and that is just such a beautiful human experience that we get to witness here <3 just warms my heart. Good job Ed, keep on smokin!
Klaus at the end had me rolling!!   "Did you invent that pepper??" "yes" "Why????"
Better put a seatbelt on your toilet
Im sure smokin ed has a couple defense contracts
The day Ive been waiting for.
"Did you Invent that Pepper?"  YES.  "Why?"  Says it all, I won't inflict this on myself but well done on quite a ridiculous achivement - in a good way!
My eyes started watering just watching this...
You can tell Ed actually loves his staff. He seems like a down to earth guy.
Poor chili klaus😂 im in heat
Sounds like eating rattlesnake venom
Look Ed's pepper was noticeably green and danish bro Chili Claus ate the ripe X ! So yeah it's the spiciest! He just ate almost 3 million units of heat units! My question is, how many peppers does it take to make that little bottle of heat sauce? My guess would be one pepper per bottle, should do it. Or is it a recipe secret? Thank you very much!
Claus is touching his face so much it's giving me anxiety
"Did you invent that? ...why?" 😂
it's been 6 years
All tears shed on this show are real whether they are spice-induced or not.
Chili Klaus almost drank Carolina Reaper sauce for relief. 😂❤
passion, love it
It's exciting to see someone so excited about a product they've created. The fact that he can rub big corporation's noses in his success just makes it so much sweeter.
Wondering how Lorde's composure would have held up against this thing.
I'm in Heat. Thanks for that huge laughbreakout , Chili Klaus XD
Ed changed the world again and 5 yrs from now there will be "Pepper X" tacos at taco bell.
When you know the Guinness guy on a first name basis you know you break a lot of records
It was dope hanging with yall last month.
Never seen the pepper King like this dude
I love watching klaus and sean together
Da bomb is going to be so much tastier and so much meaner if they get a deal for these peppers.
Why would you 😂
Drugs seem like a much safer alternate
"I'm in heat!"
Wow!!!!!! Congrats on the pepper!!! I can not wait to get my hands on a couple and to try out the new sauce :D  F#*K YES!!!! YOU LEGEND SMOKIN ED! And to those that helped! You guys rock too :D
can we just take a moment to acknowledge ed’s unflinching resolve in the face of that pepper
I love Ed so freaking much. He is so amazing and passionate. Good for him for this win and I hope any corporation trying exploit his hard work and innovation for their own profit. Unconscionable.
It’s crazy I visited his store here in south right down the road from where I live and then started seeing him all over YouTube. His store is in fort mill sc in case anyone wants to visit
“I’m in heat”…haha!😆🔥🔥🔥
I love comments where people state the absolute obvious. It’s my favorite.
Sean: " I love seeing you, but I also dont like it" Love him & Klau's chemistry.
How can I try this pepper? Do I need to go to the farm?
I love this so much
I'M IN HEAT
Ed getting emotional about the recognition for all the hard work he put into something he's passionate about is what I'm here for.
12:00 Klaus looks like he just wants to lay down 😂😂
Im in....going to order the sauce tomorrow
Ok, call up Rhett & Link, they have a new one to eat.
What was the music in the intro?
So happy nobody died :D <3
Congrats Ed! Thanks but no thanks.. there's just no way. 😂
Soon enough peppers are jist gonna start hunting you instead of being spicy
That messed Klaus up!! Lol.  Weh
Chilli klause your the man bro 😂😂😂😂
I wanted Klaus to confirm once again that the peppers are even hotter than his Scandinavian cousins'!
Does Klaus seem a bit depressed? Inflated by life choices that let him here?
How does one acquire Smokin' Ed Curries build?
If you didnt feel the heat and sweat watching, your not a spice fan 😂
How cool is that!? Congrats Ed and team!!
Absolutely a great video!!
I think there's some oak in it 🤣🤣🤣
Chili Klaus !!!!!!!!
Smokin ed doing the lords work 👏🏻congrats to the heat goat!!!
Chili Klaus is the best
What an Emotionally Charged Pepper eating video. Loved Chili Klaus and Ed.  Thanks and Congratulations Ed on such a huge achievement!
Correction, it's the "Guiness hottest pepper."  They only sample selective groups.  There could be hotter peppers out there that are never given to Guiness.  Not to take away from Ed's accomplishments!
The creator of pepper x literally the living embodiment of the creation can never harm the creator. They're all getting bodied and he's just there trying to talk them through it all lol 🤣 like yea your measle tear isn't comparable to their pain love it 😂
The Apollo pepper is hands down my favorite.
This is the Hot Ones content we need! The guests have not been as great lately but this is awesome! Thanks for this!
It needs a better name
Dude hahaha how are them peppers even legal??? 🤣🤣🤣
Congratulations Ed, To the whole team you guys are pepper gods 😂
Pepper X owner almost look like he have Covid lol.
Love Ed’s work, but when Guiness gets involved it just cheapens it all for me.  For those who don’t know: Guiness is basically “pay tens of thousands to basically get any record you want.” They are a novelty company NOT a record keeping one. 9:06
Love that receiving the award is what makes Ed get choked up and brings tears to his eyes and not the almost 3 million Scoville pepper be ate.
Ed needs to brush his teeth...
I had no idea Ed was just an hour down the road from me. I’ve gotta take a trip soon assuming they have a storefront. Hopefully I can catch him there and he will let me sign a waiver to suffer 😂
awesome work, inspirational!!
If Pepper X is what destroyed Ed's teeth, I ain't trying it.
Don't you have to sign papers to buy these things??
i am still suspicious. i need third-party testing results regarding the alleged, capsaicin concentration of pepper x.
Ed is an absolute mad scientist. Look upon my works, ye mighty, and despair.
If I ever become a villain bent on taking over the world to have superheroes save it, this is how I would torment my victims.   Make them eat tons of Pepper X and watch for my own personal enjoyment
You should call it "The Flower of Evil". From some angles it looks like a pitted flower bud.  And it's a book of poems from Charles Baudelaire.
Another reason I'm proud to be a South Carolinian! Hot stuff is state-wide!
Vayolence
Pure violence in your mouth.
Just release the seeds.. speaks about big business, behaves like big business
Wait a minute lol. Sorry I'm still trying to wrap my head around the fact he has a war chest in case someone else gets something hotter out he has nuclear options at his disposal. He probably has a pepper 5X in there.
It looks like nurgles testicles
IF I could muster the strength to eat this I'm scared it would acually cause medical grade damage to my insides.
Congrats ED!!! Thanks for a great HOT ONES episode! It was EPIC
Can't wait for Johnny Scoville to get ahold of these Pepper X peppers. Dude is a Beast💪
I love that you can see how much love and time he put into making his pepper. Receiving the award really choked him up. Absolutely love it!! 👏🏽 👏🏽 👏🏽
You know he probably has even hotter peppers waiting for the right time to release.
Never....😂
Ed is a God amongst men.
This was an incredible episode! Ed’s emotion, Sean’s support of Ed, and Klaus coming in and cracking us all up, truly so special!!
Ed's clear passion for peppers absolutely wonderful, and him talk about loving to see people's fear response from peppers was hilariously diabolical.
where can i order this?
Wait till it comes out the other end!
Don't even know the guy but seeing him receive his plaque gave me so much joy!!! History is made shoutout to Ed!!!
wonder if u could eat the pepper with seeds, and collect them later if ya know what i mean?
Pepper-X everyone has been gagging to get some X seeds for at least half a decade. Hopefully they will become available in time for the next season. Though it is best to start indoors in January.
What is the scoville of the Xperience?
watch this channel since high school ....lol...
Love when he starts to explain what they are feeling!
Heat😂
Whenever i see chili klaus I know I’m about to hear hiccups and finger snapping 😂 😂
Stakkels Klaus, poor Klaus ...wow what a ride 😂😂😂
People and corporations trying to steal Ed's peppers like he's Chili Wonka.
"We have a surprise for you!" They looked so surprised when the guy, standing right beside them and they where on first name term with, suddenly moved in to the frame.
Plz make a shirt “im in heat”
It's an amazing feeling to finally be validated after much pain.
Pepper X seems fitting considering it gives you a more cerebral experience… professor Charles Xavier using Cerebro… you pickin up what I’m puttin down? Eh eh eh? Lol 😜
Congrats to Smokin' Ed Currie, amazing story.
7:06 There's something so inspiring to me about watching people who give their heart and soul to something that most other people don't really care about. Like this dude just wants to make spicy peppers - that's his dream - and watching somebody be moved to tears over something that may seem silly to other people is really inspiring to me. Obviously, there's a financial incentive for him, but I get the feeling that he'd be working just as hard at this if there weren't a penny to be made off it.
Irony of Ed Curry talking about stealing peppers.....
10:35 when they eat the pepper
Ed has so much passion for what he does, it's inspiring. What an amazing guy!
These guys are badass!!
"I'm in heat."  "Heaven?..."  "I'm in heaaat."  Incredible.
What a treat! All my favorite Hot Guys together! Chili Klaus, I luv the way he kinda whispers in his sweet little voice, like he’s hoping that hellfire brewing in his mouth doesn’t cause his vocal chords to incinerate.
Big Pepper is no joke
"I'm in heat" GAGHAGAAHSHAHA Chilli Klaus is hilarious
So entertaining. I tried a similar sliver of ghost pepper, and I’ll never do it again. I could only imagine eating an entire pepper X. 😳🙌🏼👏🏼🤘🏼
My stomach is burbling 😮 just looking at it . please stop making these food bombs 😅
Why would anyone eat this lol
Pepper OG is out at it again lol
2.6 million SCOVIL  is CRAZY!!!!!!
That can't be good for you
Side by side those are both the bad and good fits of a trucker hat.
Just bought the Trio Package. Can’t wait to try the X sauce lol
Ed is the BOSS. You broke Chili Klaus!
Film them tomorrow after coffee
Why do you guys never have Johnny Scoville on the show? He’s be perfect for different levels of heat tolerance
Serious congrats to ed and his team and his farm and his pepper!! That was truly the most beautiful moment to watch a pepper and a farmer recieve such an amazing honor and award!!! Absolutely beautiful, a freakin tear of happiness... then I died laughing watching all you silly people suffer through eating pepper x... lol except ed...that guy was having the best time!!! So much love to this show... you people are good beautiful people!! Genuinely.
Ed be like, "I use pure capsaicin as table salt." "And it's quite good actually."
I love when y’all do these lol
It's all just an ad for products in the end
Ed's the man.
Chili Klaus! "I love the flavor 😵"
Has anyone heard from chili clause since this episode?
Hasn't pepper x been a thing for a few years now??
chili is a national treasure, protect that man! hahahaha
Mad respect ❤
AWWWW!!!! Gave Ed the chill bumps with that award! LOVE IT!
11:10 'ooo' lol
I don't really like the Guinness company being called in, since they aren't the authority on anything and have a past of not doing their homework on the records they put out, as well as allowing themselves to be bullies into stating untrue records, such as Billy Mitchell's and Todd Roger's videogame scores.
I love how everything went from calm, collected and proud to everybody crying and rocking on set. 😂
Pepper X no relation to Malcolm X😂🤣🤣
Why? That thing has spikes growing out it. 😅😅😅... just hatred.
Thats Fantastic!!! Congartulations
HotOnes do a fan season and I will absolutely be there 💯
I would imagine how it feels when it goes out to the rear end.
Congratulations Sir. Cannot wait to grow this one.
i think the carolina reaper was rather weak, so would love to try this one, maybe it can make me react in some way
12:26 "I-I'm in HEAT"
Mr. Currie took that like a BEAST
not guinness
Yes, The kings of chili are back together! Great to see Klaus back on the channel!!
Great job man! Sadly guinness is useless and can’t be trusted.
This is so good. Just nice people being great. Love it.
THIS is the stuff I love about this channel! GREAT video! I laughed hard :)
"Look at his eyes. He looks like he's trippin bawls."  "I love you, man." Hahahahha
14:00 Ed, imma let you finish, but…
klaus is looking like regret before he ate it xd
I love how Smokin' Ed is explaining the pain and you can see Chili Klaus as a prime example
Ed kinda seems like an assholr
LOL, two People dying on set, two to watch and smile
I always make sure to have a bottle of hot sauce nearby whenever I’m watching videos like these 🔥
"What's it taste like?"  "Pencil."  Sounds delicious.
"I'm in heat!" hahaha, god i love Chili Klaus :D Skål in Mælk!
Ed reminds me of David Blaine, the magician. While everyone is in a state of shock, he just calmly explains what is happening (even the voice is similar). It’s crazy how composed he is after eating such a hot pepper.
Ed you are sick man and awesome at the same time.
Love to see Klaus back on the show, It's always juicy :D
Ed talking about flavour being the most important when he bred the reaper is hilarious, that thing tastes disgusting.
The part was the “did you invent that pepper?” “Yes” “why?!”
Orange hat guy is so hot 😍
What you came for starts around 10:30 😀
HAHSHAHAHHAHAHA THIS WAS AWESOME
INSANITY, on my first viewing i somehow missed that ed had eaten one of the peppers. it wasnt until coming to the comments that i run it back and am just BLOWN AWAY by ed having NO reaction what a champion!
I love seeing someone that gets recognized and truly loves his work. Wonderful to hear him speak. What a sweetheart
Ed is a beast! Dude really held it together
Ed Currie is not a human
I'm very pleased with Ed Currie. It was really sweet how happy he was, it almost brought me to tears to be honest. And I hope he continues to be successful with his company and the chillies. ❤️
Congrats to everyone!  Now this is how you advertise.
Chili Klaus  <3<3<3<3<3
Congratulations
The one chip challenge next year is gunna be fun to watch.
Ed seems like such a great guy. I always love seeing him in videos. Congratulations to him and his team!
Congratulations Ed on the hottest pepper in the world but I don't see me eating one of them in my lifetime..... Unless a lot of money is on the line.     😂
could've invited also johnny scoville from chase the heat.
This pepper looks actually dangerous😂
Mmm oak and pencil flavor notes are my jam!
is guiness '' official '' though. eh. still. kudos Ed and I'd never attempt to eat one.🤣🤣
Also Sean looks like a Titan from Attack on Titans after eating the pepper 🤣
Chilli is so hot it sends Chilli Klaus into heat
👊🏻🍖🌺🔥🔥🔥
CHILI KLAUS!
Lasts two hours😮
Chilli Klaus is the best !!! I’m in heat 😂😂
My eyes burn from just  seeing this💀
Wow! What an honor and WHAT a pepper !!
You wanna know how we know Ed is a good man?   At the moment of truth, he kept saying “we” did this, “we” did that, not “I” did this.
I'm soooo interested
Congratulations to Ed and his crew. Ed seems like a great dude. Not a chili head but I love some heat might give it a dab. 👊🔥🤘
“I’m in heat!” 😂😂😂😂
Don’t eat pencils.
“I’m in heat” took me out 😂
Klaus was ready to breed after that haha
i love these special episodes. i nerd out whenever u guys get together!
😂 I always love when I get to see poor clause and Sean together with a pepper in hand ❤😂
🌶 Chilli Klaus that DOOD!! ♡ love ya man.
Face feels tighter? Maybe we can use these as natural temporary Botox wow
Ed getting emotional about the record 🥹
Who knew this would choke me up 😢
I love ed  ...his autism is comforting
3 times hotter than the CR.  LOL.
“I like the way ppl look really scared when they’re eating my hot sauce” 😂😂😂 a true “heatonist” 😂
Tusind Klaus for at være CRAZY nok til at være den anden i verden til at smage en hel Pepper X - STÆRKT!!!
The trinity of chili madness! Just lovin it! :)
ConGratz ED. keep up the amazing work and thanks for giving us the plessure to see both shean and klaus in absolut panic for once,  its so rare to see sean panic like that from spice so its nice to see he got human toleranses of pain aswell. =)   looking forward to trying your new pepper out.
epic episode
Dude just munched the worlds hottest chilli and didnt bat an eyelid. Does he have the world record for chilli eating too?
I'm used to tearing up because of smokin' Ed but now it's because of the feels in my heart and not my mouth.
Did he survive
I love Claus so much! Let’s give him some love🤟🏻
The point where Ed gets the certificate says so much. He is so emotional he can barely speak. It shows how much work and effort was put into this for years.   Real passion towards his coworkers and his craft.
Klaus is the best lol, IM IN HEAT
These guys are so cute together 😂😂😂
Ed broke the world record and everyone else but the best tag comes from Chilli - why?
i wish i could love something as much as Mr Smokin' Ed loves chili peppers, it's beautiful to witness, congrats.
P.S.  Ed's genuine reaction and appreciation, priceless
Happy for this dude. This rules.
Chiliklaus the og heaterrr
Thanks for the 😂🤣!
The ART of asking questions, Sean you are a MASTER
They broke my dawg chilli Klaus
Chili's back! 🌶
The pride on Ed's face around 6:36 is awesome.
Absolutely ZOOTED 😂
Lol  Klaus is breeding
1.2m views in 18 hours - I think that says it all
Ya'll NEED to get Johnny Scoville on here for stuff like this.
"I'm in heat" 😂
LOVE YOU GUYS!!!!!!!!!
Brilliant! Congratulations Ed and the team.
Bautiful moment ❤ congrats!!
All hail House Currie!
Now there's head high and body high to peppers?
One day these guys will die from tasting the new hottest pepper that's fatally hot
Noone gonna mention the disgusting yellow teeth?
The way both pepper dudes just chilling after eating the pepper and they are laughing. Haha. They have no reactions since they have no taste buds from tasting it all the time. Or maybe they just know whats gonna happen. Haha
So good to see Klaus  back!
I was just wondering when klaus was going to be back on the show. 🎉😂
Ed's such a real guy even when hes is known for being modest and keeping it to himself you could see all the emotion coming through him as andy gave him the certificate All props to him and the team!
Might be the first time I've seen Ed struggle at all which is insane
🇩🇰  Copenhagen supports
Them: This is gonna be fun!  PepperX: Ah... Here we go again. Maybe end their careers, or just incinerate their insides?
Ed is a beast!
Great! I have waited so long for this reveal, especially with all my favorite pepperheads on the planet! ❤
Oh no youse done burnt Chilli Klause up!!! Ed lookin like he only ate a green bell pepper 🫑!!! I love   the reaper but...don't think I can handle the X... maybe I'm just scared 😱
I have to have one
"it has no real throat burn like the reaper..."  employee instantly; "i'm getting throat burn actually" 🤣
Love hot but don't like going beyond a certain point.. however,  Ed's passion and hard work make me want to do the damage and go for it😊
Klaus:  "i'm in heat!" Ed:  "Klaus is breeding"  😂
I had to pause the video to say, Chili Klause presence makes for completion. I might start a sports league where it's  mandatory to start with, Oye, one, oyeaaah... Chili Klause!
It starts at 11:02 (with the exception of King Ed) you notice a significant change in less than 30 seconds! They go from cool calm and collected to a wild bunch in a matter of seconds! Congrats! 😅🌶😮🌶😂🌶
11:15 Ed's just looking at Sean seemingly thinking, "what on Earth is he talking about?"  🤣🤣🤣
He said oak and pencil
Let’s give these to captured terrorists
Beautiful color on that pepper
Looks like you've been growing it too close to the nuclear power plant😊
Ed is the average man  He pours his heart and soul into his passion and n ok thing is more rewarding then saying you done a good job  We are simple creatures
The my Rushmore of spicey is these 3 men and whoever first invited the first hot sauce. That's the only correct my Rushmore of hot
I need to see Johnny Scoville's take on this
I love watching people eat super spicy foods while discussing various topics.. but I'll never understand why people would put themselves through this on purpose? If their sphincters had any say in it...
“I’m in heat.” 😂😂😂❤️
What happens, if somebody ends up in the hospital from consuming that?
How is Klaus now? He was seriously hurting
Yes it does... about 2 hour's 😭😂
Wow people trying to steal his hard work.
This is pure joy. All ways around. Congrats!!
"Congratulations, you're officially amazing." 😂😂😂
Did you do that? Did you invent that pepper? Yeah. Whhy?
Pepper X's name should be Peppers of Mass Destruction
The only person missing from this was David Blaine.
Seeing Ed tear up and thankful for his team's achievement was worth it. Just harvested my first Reaper this past week and tried it. So good.
Is very tasteful 🤣
Ah so Ed finally got cashed up enough to get Guinness to certify the rating.   It's been a lot of years to get it consistent enough.
Congratulations Ed 🎉
BOUT TIME KLAUS RETURNED!
Smokin’ Ed does it again
Im...in...heat 😂😂😂
🥳🥳 Im going to have an X-sample!
I can not imagine how you will feel when the Pepper X exited your body.... hahahaha
Haha i dont think Claus knows what it means to "Be in heat" 😆
You know it’s hot when Chili Klaus starts clicking 🥵🤣🤣
Would love to buy seeds for pepper x direct from Ed! Hope he can get the profit he deserves from the back of pepper x!
Quite possibly the best host ever.
Biblical
the involuntary arm movements are hilarious
I ate a half of a Carolina Reaper last week and thought I was dying as I lay on the bathroom floor at work for nearly forty minutes. Possibly the worst discomfort of my life. I'm not going near this one.
Love how that guy thinks its something to be proud of, it tastes awful and 99.99% won't try it.
Seems fake
Was there any specific reason Sean didn't eat a whole one?
Proven here - when people of fortitude get nearer to death they turn to humor to continue onward
most wholesome show on the whole internet is a bunch of guys toasting their insides with peppers. Its amazing.
That was such a feel good episode!
That quiet "why" from Chili Klaus got me
I'm sorry Sean, but you realise that having only a slice of the Pepper X means at some point you now have to do a full one with Chili Klaus! I say this only because I never will...
I will never doubt these men & their courage ever!
Love Smoking Ed, can clearly see his passion and love for his craft and his people
I’m obsessed with Smokin’ Ed Currie.
Yeah that's a no go for me if it tapped chili out nope not going near that one his faces were the best I see why Sean only did a slice so he could do TV oh but you're eating one Sean I know it!
Ed is not from this world
I will never understand how people willingly eat chiles to stay on the toilet for hours, maybe that's just me
Mt Rushmore of Spice right here!
You can start the video at about 10:00 😉
Let's snap it into the credits 😂❤
Is reaper is floral ???  NFW   ITS a tomahawk missile destined to do one thing only, total annihilation
I think I'd be needed to be taken to the Emergency room after tasting this pepper, I almost went to the Er once with Ghost pepper haha.  Or I'd be dead
"Do I just look like Taylor Swift?" 💀
Di I look just like Taylor Swift? Shake shake shake it off 😂❤
I got a little choked up I must admit...it was the pepper I swear, it got in my eyes.
I was hoping for David Blaine. Since he kept his composure while eating a Carolina Reaper vs Chili Klaus. Now I wanna see a Ed vs David episode with this pepper.
What a heartwarming video! 😊
"Did you do that? Did you invent the pepper?" "Yeah!" "Why?!"
He deserves that award ❤ him and his TEAM 🎉
Klaus is an animal. Ed is a monster.
Introducing the Heatonist before Ed? Come on now ...
"I'm in hEEt" - Klaus 2023
Imagine the pepper spray…
Insanity!! 😂
Incredible! Congrats to Ed and his team! Cant believe he crushed his last record by a whole million!!
The last dab should be an experience over da bomb. I hate that da bomb is still in the line up just for the reaction its honestly prolly the worst hot sause out there.
That pepper just looks evil
👏🇩🇰
You know, when you eat something that your body reacts to like this, it is not good for you. Peace.
The fact that its a dane that is the most insane person makes me smile :D (yes I am a dane too)
Watching Ed eating the pepper like it´s french fries is just hilarious 😆
😂😂😂 this was great!!! I really enjoyed this frfr congrats to Ed Currie 🎉🎉🎉 for some odd reason I love eating spicy food  while watching. Hopefully I can do the challenge in the near future ❤
I want to know what the highest tolerance to peppers can be explained by the Scoville Scale. ....because at some point there can be no tolerance.
There were several times when Chili Klaus put his hands around and next to his eyes. Every time it freaked me out. This chili pepper, if used incorrectly, would be a horrendous torture device on a victim. I can only image the pain
I wonder 🤔 what one pepper would taste like mixed into a Pint of Sour Cream?! Hahahahahahahaha 😂!!!
That... Looked painful!
I have heard rumours about Pepper X being a new world record and I have been waiting for so long for it to be officially recognised. Well Done Ed.
All I am imagining is the toilet seat 😂 the next day
all i imagine is, what is it like coming out the other end? curry always seems to burn worse the second time for me
You should do a Hot Ones with Mads Mikkelsen and Chili Klaus together.
Sean you should try adding God Slayer's hot sauce! 9 mil scoville
Made my day. Just bring on the peppers ;)
yes chili klaus ive been waiting for years!!!
MORE KLAUS! Klaus and Sean make up such a good duo!
So let me see if If I got this right. It is 1,000,000 Scoville Units Hotter than a Carolina Reaper. Ya, ok I am Definitely Not Going To Be Trying That!!!
Please, more Ed and Claus, as an Og I watch and show the Carolina testing video at least twice a year since it was released, this one is gonna be there, but need more 😂
ed snackin a pepper x like its nothing scares me xD
Here for Chili Klaus
Peppers as drugs. A+ advertising.
🥺
I know Shawn's got to much on the line now, but I would have loved to see him and claus pop whole ones together
Congratulations on the record, can't wait to try it, thanks to ed and his work force for all they do
"Why?" 😂😅
Legends
Ed Currie...the psychotic, sadistic mind warping nutcase we didn't know the world needed.
Hello, random watcher here. Found Chiliklaus does sell the sauces online in germany.  Want to buy a few for Christmas. But taste is more important then scovill for me. Would I be with Los Calientes on a good go since many pomis liked it? Whats else that tastes great, even tho its hellish hot?
“I’m in heat” x2   Followed by: “Thank You”   Chili Clause is an epic legend 🌶️
I bet that Ed already have another cultivar that’s hotter than pepper x
"DID YOU DO THAT? DID YOU INVENT THAT PEPPER?" "Yeah." WHY?
Congrats, but seriously, insert 'Nope' gif here.
"Oh no, Klaus is breeding" had me DYING
These guys are champions!! But also a bit sick to enjoying so much suffering!! 😂😅
So was this pepper previously known as Twitter?
I love these guys SO much. I like hot stuff, but I also want flavor. Just WOW!
Would love to see Johnny Scoville try one of these...
Amazing! I can only imagine the pain whilst eating and the day after. 😂
How could you not love Chili Klaus? That dude is a legend.
Missed Chilli Claus! Surprised there was no hiccuping😂
'I'm in heat' 🤣
"Pencil"
This episode is my dream come true!!! By far the Best episode ever!!!! ❤
lol I’m so high I read the title Sean Strickland and was waiting for him to come out😂😂😂
I love Chili Klaus
Ed was the guy that helps guide ppl through their highs 😂
Ed loves himself a little to much
🔥Smokin' Ed Currie 🔥   🔥King of the Chili 🔥  Everybody is dying around the table...... Meanwhile Ed be like....ok...so let me explain what's happening here
cant wait until some crazy extremist muslim takes out this loser curry guy
Lets get mr scoville to try and get an honest opinion, guessing that wont happen
That looked a little hot
Chili Klaus is back, baby!
We know it's real when Klaus snaps his fingers
Bathroom time will be great for these guys
lol i can see one of them swallowed the pepper immediately and pretends to chew it.  next time, slice it in small piece for a fair tect challenge.
Protections are legislated in the Plant Patent Act (PPA), enacted in 1930, and administered by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Protection lasts for 20 years and gives inventors the right to prevent others from reproducing, selling, or using the plant.
I have a feeling Ed is gonna try to make something even hotter than Pepper X eventually, can't wait to see what this madman and his team of lunatics come up with next.
I Hate the name pepper x, even though they explained why it still seems lazy imo
They killed chili klaus 😂! Congratulations Mr. Currie, I’ll never try one ever lol, but I applaud your success
Ed is a frikin machine ahhaa 😅
At the ten-minute mark, I wasn't even watching but just listening and the actual fear in Seans voice became super obvious. To the point I dropped everything and tuned in properly. He is actually terrified! 😂
Insane, amazing, hilarious, so good!
Beautiful
Hate to say this but I want to try 1
Can you imagine what an extract of this would produce?!?! Satan's blood is only like 600k Scoville as an extract that had me second guessing my life choices. I can't fathom 2.6 almost 2.7 million.
Get ed some whitening toothpaste
Man, Ed got to be a supernatural being, to stand up to something 3x hotter than a Reaper, and handles it like a Boss - while Chili Klaus is melting down... great video Sean !!
Maybe I missed something, why didn't Sean eat a whole one too? Just didn't want to? I don't blame him.
Ed is such a wholesome freak.
Man can only make out "I'm in heat." 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"I'm in heat."
“I’m in heat!” And “shake shake shake it off” 🤣
Love these guys. Amazing men!
Congrats Ed. Doing it again!!!! You are a legend!!! One day I will meet you. Im scared of this one for sure though.
Silver klaus is a vibe
10:38 🌶️🥵😊
really sean a sliver lol
Takes a bite....passes out
This is like my favourite lineup ever!!!
New tattoo: Im in heat
Ed's a national treasure
“Even though I don’t look it, i’m feeling just like Klaus feeling”  Sure, Ed, I can clearly see it.
Gimme dat pepper X! Gonna go grab some Xperience
Can we please have Klaus back more often?
No thank you!
I didn't even eat one and I'm sweating 😅😂😂😂
Next Stage: Powerpuff Girls
Wow great job Ed! You could tell he was proud of everyone who helped him reach this milestone what a fantastic thing to witness! Be more like Ed everyone.
I'm in Heat 😂😂😂
No.  No.   ummm, yeah, No!  Thank you, but no.
Y'all are CRAZY!!!
You broke Chili Klaus 😂😂😂
Ed is such a Humble dude.
I love it...Sean saying 'if you want to test yourself against a PEPPER X...'  Seriously?  I tapped out at about 500,000Scovilles. I think it would take all the gold in America to get me to try one of those! Smokin' Ed, congratulations on your Guiness record!
Couldn't help but laugh him getting emotional for his hot chilly award 🤣
demmm new pepper
So no one is disappointed Sean dint eat the whole pepper with them
Wow! Congratulations with the Guinness World Record.  The reactions after eating the chilli is hilarious. You're braver men than I
I really enjoy watching hard work paying off
“Klaus what do you thing about the pepper?” “Pencil.”
Even with the different spelling, I'm not sure it's a coincidence his career has been creating the hottest peppers and his name being Currie. He was born for this, lol.
Even the crunch of the pepper sounded hot lol🥵🥵
chili klaus!!!!
And thank you Guinness World Records
I’M IN HEAT 😩
I was one of those naysayers and non believers. I've never been so happy to have to eat my own words. Congrats Ed and team!
I might’ve shed a tear or two.
I dont think apollo sauce is very hot. The insanity sauce burns hotter to me.
I'm in heat!
I'm in heat 😂😂 Thank you for inviting Chili Klaus back for this thing.
😂
I'm in heeeatttt 🤣
Chili Klaus hooligans unite!
Congratulations to Ed and his team such a sweet great man punishing the world with his passion.
I'm worse than any of them from just a jalapeño. I'm actually scared that I would die if I ate pepper x.
50 usd for shipping a S22 box across the pond to Norway, Naah I’m good.
Ed ate it like it was a cupcake 😅 Ed is a GOAT!
I love Klaus 🫡💪🏻
On no, klaus is breeding 🤷🏼‍♂️
12:35
Emotional Damage😊. Concrats Ed and his Team🎉
The Chili Klaus Hiccup™.
This is a huge moment for everyone involved, literal history. Thank you for sharing with us.
I wonder what it would take for Rhett and Link to eat this...
Started watching just after COVID hit - never watched anything on youtube before that, enjoyed lots of episodes, never pulled the trigger on the hot sauces till today, found them pricey for Canada, but not today, that World Record had me flipping over the CC fast, best $76 CND i ever spent (3 bottles with pepperX) a moment well worth it's place History - I have eaten more chicken wings at different places in Canada wide than anyone, 8 months on the road coast to coast, wings for lunch and dinner, but that was 20 years ago lol they were $10-30 cent wings back then lol, LOVE the SHOW, it was made for PPL like me! now i can share in the pain!
@ 12:37 Klaus is breeding lol
Did I miss something?... Why didn't Sean do the whole pepper?
Really awesome all of his hard work is being recognized ❤
That smile on eds face after they ate it, is amazing
@ 12:28 IM IN HEAT ...lol
Congrats Ed   The best show on YouTube Sean.  Just awesome!
Ed is not human !!!
Smokin Ed is a MADMAN
Go ed!! 🎉
very cool…
Nobody can believe how calm Sean is during Hot Ones.  Then here comes Ed "There are levels to this" Currie.
Finally! Klaus is back! And you delivered :) Great video.
I hope they are fine after this
Absolutely the best news I've heard in a while! Congratulations, Ed! Watching Klaus, even I started to snap my fingers. 2,693,000 SUs might even top the Alien's acid blood.
Sean is going to end up having a Pavlovian response to seeing Klaus.
Legends! Congratulations ed!
Is Klaus alright? Somwbody please check on him. Lol
Bring Johnny Scoville on, cowards!
Huge congrats to Ed!  Well-deserved and a great pepper!
he almost made "heat level comes before flavor" sound good
How is Sean still talking🤣
Everyone else:" Dear God this is hot." Ed Currie: " You guys feel anything yet?"
Love the Chillie Claus and Sean Evans collab!
For an added amount of fun, it looks slightly like diarrhea
I love how nonchalant Ed is about eating these peppers   Just “You’ll be the first person, other than me, to eat this pepper”
I'm tearing up from Ed's reaction, congratulations dude and you did right by giving credit to your team.
Congrats! Long before Reaper, I remember using the breeding techniques for the 'Peruvian Death Pepper '. I, too won a different kind of horticulture award. So thankful
Congratulations Ed!! From the hairs sticking up on his arms to choking up and almost throwing out tears. Can we all take a minute to appreciate how amazing Ed is. The most honest and modest man around. His pride and love of peppers are absolutely outstanding! Sean, Chili, & Noah definitely appreciate who you are Ed and this video shows the respect and admiration they have for you. Great friends that will always be there for each other. That’s what life is all about. 👏 🙏 🌶️ 🥵 🔥
Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope.   Respect to Ed and his team and Heatonist and Sean but that’s insane.
“I’m in heat” was all I needed to hear to know I’m not built for Pepper X 🤣
I get some horrer vibes from them redneck smiles. i guess it takes one to make some.
i'm in heat
🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
Ed must have a tongue made of scorched leather by now, buddy was hardly phased lol
Klaus is back in town baby!!! and he is in heat!
I found out after eating a bunch of Carolina Reaper cheese last night that instead of drinking milk and swallowing it, if you put it in your mouth and just leave it it really does help
I love this group of friends
I love this man not a single reaction and this dude went into heat
Klaus: Did you invent that pepper?   Ed: Yeah   Klaus: Why? 😂
"what we thought was the maximum"..... og he got an even hotter pepper for sure LOL
I love my last dab sauce! I put it on my home made mac and cheese w/ bacon bits.  Congrats!
ed is definitely a sadomasochist lol
I want to see David Blane eat this one 😂
I would like to see Sean and these other guys try the tube of terror challenge I bet it's way hotter than just 1 pepper x
Ed sounds like Nick Saban.
Ed, Congrats on the World Record. I can't imagine what you have laying in the vault but how about a Blue Pepper X? :P
Have you ever had a pepper so hot it made you start breeding
Ed says he felt it…I think Ed might as well have had a scoop of vanilla ice cream Lolol.
Judging by the really disproportionate reaction, I cannot help but assume that Ed is a genetic freak, born with some kind of spiciness / pain receptor deficiency. Which has probably sent him along the path of creating such monstrosities.
I'm convinced you could pepper spray Ed in the face and he'd tell you about the flavor notes without breaking a sweat. Congrats to Ed and team!
Seeing Klaus brought back so many memories... time really does fly!
Congratulations All!! Teared up ...
CHILI KLAUS!!  - dying completely -"I love the flavor..."" -continues dying.     Epic episode!
Absolutely amazing ❤❤🎉🎉🎉
Please get the LA BEAST on this show!!
GG Ed, Keep Pushin For Hotter Peppers Man 🎉🎉🎉
Ed Currie is a terrifying man. I would love to meet him
The fact that Ed doesn’t even bat an eye chowing down on pepper X. But gets literal goosebumps and beams with such gratitude and pride for his team’s work is the embodiment of the kinda brand I want to support for the rest of time and makes me want to pick up a bottle of this even if I just carry it around in my purse as a self defense weapon. 🩵🩵🩵 we love Ed
Instant classic episode. Jordan & Pip are Sean & Clause
Ed tryin his hardest too make a pepper that's going too nuke the humans stomach
"I'm in heat" will go down in history as the greatest tag line ever of Pepper X. Classic! Well done Chili, well done.
It is nice to known that Klaus can STILL go into heat at hi age…..
Ed can eat chillies all day, but it was the Record Plaque that really blew him away. Such a humble reaction from a man who has dedicated his life to achieving this goal. Made me tear a little for him, not gonna lie 😭 what an immense moment of recognition for all the hard work done by Puckerbutt ❤️
Ed is a national treasure.
I could watch these guys for hours, just talking after the event. They are funny, knowledgeable, everything.
Did you invite  this papper? Why?:)
If Klaus is in pain, its got to be hott!
This was a delight to watch! Congrats to Ed and his team for dethroning the reaper. And thanks to Sean and Chili Klaus for the entertainment it's always a joy seeing them wriggle in pain 😂
When is Ed going to release pepper ex to purchase i want to grow it from seeds
This is the single greatest episode ever. Truly for the long time fans. Ed’s commentary as everyone is dying is classic
never understood why people like food so spicy? if i wanted to feel like my face was on fire id spray myself in the face with bear mace and then dunk my head in gasoline and light myself on fire.
Ed is a legend. Dude seems like a great guy.
Ed needs less peppers and more toothpaste.....
You gotta love Klaus
chilli klaus is too crazy
I'm commenting only for the algorithm 😂 Epic lads. Well done. Ship me a bottle to Aotearoa (New Zealand)!
Well deserved and I love this man!!!  Well deserved Andy and ur whole team
I follow several chilli eaters on you tube. This is truly exciting to see. I will likely never know what a supper hot is like, and defiantly not Peper X. I can't get my tolerance high enough.  I am waiting for videos of regret from the people trying this pepper who should not.   Very well done Ed on creating Pepper X and award from Guinness World Records.
Da bomb X coming soon
Am I the only one who thinks ghost, reapers and such taste grassy? I don’t like the flavor.
WOW they are insane for eating that pepper LOL Ed ate that pepper like a G!
I'm not gonna hurt you Claus... LUL the pepper is.
Ed is a true gangster...id love to see him and jonny scoville have a eat off of fresh pepper x pods and see who eats more and can tolerate it with a 5 minute afterburn of no drinks
Gotta have David Blaine try it next!!!
It ain't a chili klaus collab if he wont mention the flavor!
I WAS WAITING FOR THE FINGER SNAPPING FROM CHIILI CLAUS,AND THERE IT ITS AT THE END
lol ook who had the job of turning down Evens and Clauses sound! lol just because I can't hear them putting the marines to shame doesn't meen I don't see it. lol Klause: mmumble mumble. Ok i'm (mumble) done! lol I think have a good idea what he said. Aaa:11:55  I have pretty good idea what he actually said.
Currie is a menace to society 😂😂
Chili Klaus is a mythical creature. ✨🌶️
Lost all respect for evan for not participating,  smh
Saucinnn I’m saucinnnn I’m saucinnnn on yyooouuuuuu
I know it’d ruin me but i really want to try the pepper x
Get Rhett and Link here ASAP
He literally re weaponised the peppers self defense
At 12:05, Ed is calmly explaining what is happening to the body, and clearly is super amused by how it's destroying them. The smile he gets when he talks about their brains saying "what's going on?" I died. 😂😂😂
Paper Rex collab please
Congratulations Ed and pepper X
The color on B cam was way green. They didn’t match at all, and it wasn’t corrected in post.
@Chase The Heat! When are you going to get in on this?
I know it will make me cry but I really want to eat pepper x
It's so crazy how this long-running show has so much heart to go along with all that heat.
so the apollo pepper disappear? im lost.... or was the apollo pepper a hoax?
Ed is the reason I got really into spicy food, and chemistry behind it, pursuing the hottest sauces and stuff... to the point that I have Carolina Reaper tattoo above my D
good lord almighty....
Did you invent that?......... Why......?
Ed is a maniac and I'm here for it.
Can you make your sauces kosher please?
When you were building up for Chili Klaus, I was low-key hoping you were bringing out LL COOL J.
Chili Klaus!!! Love this..."im in heat"
I wanna know the longer term impact of consuming these things. Are they going to cause damage to your intestinal tract? Also it would be amazing if they could hook people up to like Heart rate monitors or MRIs while the pepper is making it's way through your system. I'm fascinated by what the physiological response is.
I just couldn’t stop laughing 😂😂😂 hey you guys gotta bring Luke West to eat it too.
I want to see spicekingcam on the show and do pepper x!
It's been a hot minute since Chili Klaus came on!
Wow Ed. Long time coming. Congratulations. Thanks for all your hard work, and thanks to Guinness for measuring and finally recognizing a new world record pepper.  Sean, you're a legend man. You're a bounty hunter for heat lovers all over the world. Much appreciated.
Rip primotali
This was so wholesome! 😊
Oooh boi! This is what dreams are made of, commenting before watching. I'm excited to watch!
Im ALWAYS so proud, as a Dane myself, whenever I see Chili Klaus on your show - LOVE IT!👍😀❤️🇩🇰🇩🇰🇩🇰🇩🇰🇩🇰
It looks like someone dipped those in diarrhea 😂
Ed being disrespectful af! 😂  Atleast act like it hurts a little bit!
I waited years to see Klaus meet Ed....amazing achievement for Pepper X!
Forhelvede Klaus! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA  Congrats Ed 😀
I’m so happy to be able to witness pepper history! Congrats to Ed and his team and looking forward to tasting Experience 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Choc primotali is the hottest. End of.   Tried the duel crisp with the pepper x, not even hot
Ed isn't human confirmed, dude just straight up tanked the WORLDS hottest peeper like it was a normal Tuesday for him
"Klaus is breeding"
Should send these to Rhett and Link to see their reaction
😂😂😂😂😂😂 Ed is the greatest
Congratulations to Ed & the team for achieving this global success on creating the world’s hottest pepper! 🥵🌶️🥛🌐🏆🥳🎉🎈🎊
Shake shake shake it off. Haha
Let's go Ed!
You think sean evans got hemmoroids from all that heat? ...I bet he do
ITS OFFICIAL
Acquired hottest supremacy :O
Great episode and thanks to you all for stepping up to the pain train for our entertainment; except Ed who was smiling like a little boy in a toy store. Congrats to the puckerbutt team.
Funny how he describes flavor of carolina, but every carolina sauce i bought here in croatia or stuff with it just tastes like rotting feet. But congratz on the accomplishment!!!
The way Ed is completely unbothered while eating that pepper is crazy
11:18 Sean and Klaus *DYING*   Meanwhile Ed…..*:)😊😌*
sell some seedlings already, I just want a few in my yard lol
New game, take a shot everytime one of them says "pepper". Good luck
Let's go Chili Klaus!
"i'm in heat" - chilli Klaus.   At this moment i thought he was about to achieve mytosis and split into two!
Crazy😢😬🤣
I wanna build up my pepper tolerance but I always start hicuping violently even off jalapenos
I cant wait to see Johnny Scoville eat one!!
I'm in heat just watching y'all 🙃🤡😂
Great video! You guys are nutzzz! It makes for great content. Pepper X is no joke.
I've been waiting for this forever
can we get pepper x sauces in australia yet.... looks like a joy ride :)
at 11:30 it's like sean turned into a complete imposter I've never seen this man make this face thats crazy
He needs to be excited enough to use a toothbrush if you ask me
pencil!! 😂😂
Legend - congrats Ed !
I love the emotional moments that you can arise in people Sean. That's a good thing.❤😊
I want to see more behind the scenes.  How long did it take Klause to come down?  Did his third eye reveal the secrets of the universe?  Did he touch the hand of God?
I love how Ed has zero reaction to the pepper lol
And by the way. Ed doesnt even seem to be phased. I know personality traits may come into play... but when I tried a chocolate ghost pepper, I couldnt stay still. How doez he do that?!?!?!
I could have watched another hour of this. So great!
If you printed a shirt that says “I’m in heat” I’d buy it. Just throwing that out there.
I really hope you all had multiple medics on set lol  Klaus’s Scandinavian cousins have NOTHING on that 😂😂😂
First time I’ve seen klaus 1) not excited to eat a pepper 2) immediately regret eating a pepper 3) not even try to compliment said pepper. I can’t even imagine how hot X has to be…
Hearing Ed compare himself to Taylor at the end there was the icing on the cake.
Congrats Ed. Sean, give Clause a break. He seem like a nice guy. SC rules! Home of gamecocks, clemson, and Ed!!!!
Chili Klaus has gone full silver fox!
Legends!!!
LAUGHING MY HEAD OFF, AT THE SAME TIME AMAZED AT THE SPICIEST CHILLI EVER AND TO TOP IT ALL OFF, CHILLI KLAUS'S REACTION BRINGS IT ALL TOGETHER..🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I live close to Puckerbutt and see Ed fairly often, the Xperience sauce is no joke. You feel it in your spine.
I just want Klaus to say "tasteful" 😂😂 I love him ❤❤
Smokin Ed ! 💥🔥🔥🔥
This is what we all have been waiting for!
Sean why do you do this to yourself? Congrats guys on the new record
no
excellent!
“It continues” “Yeah for about two hours”  Bruh if someone told me that I’d start freaking out
Man Klaus is such a legend. That must have been otherwordly. Props to all you guys handling that heat!
we love you ed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Congratulations!! What a moment
Ed Currie is insane!! How does he handle that??
Sean getting heat flashbacks while Chili Klaus goes into heat is too hilarious. Thank y'all for suffering for our pleasure. I'm actually tempted to get a bottle of that new Pepper X 🔥
Congratulations to Ed and his team, they are truly artists at their craft.  I've enjoyed the last dab appollo for some time and will definitely be trying your pepper x experience.
“Did you do that? Did you invent that pepper?” “Yeah” “WHY?!?” 😂😂
good video.
Seriously, I've been a fan for a long while guess. Ed fan. You should do a show, "one for the fans" where ya flip a script. Have fans do the challenge but able to ask idol questions and such 😅
“Do I look like Taylor Swift?” 😂
Smoking’ Ed didn’t even break a sweat 😂
Such wholesome hotness.
Chill Klaus!!!!!!😃😃😃😃❤❤❤❤ I love him 🥰🥰🥰🥰
Klause should also get award for the first one eating it
Every time Chili Klaus put his hands to his face I yelled at the screen. Also, his "I am in heat" had me crying.
Excellent work Ed! I have been waiting for this for so long! I can't wait to feel the burn
Chili Klaus is a gem
So i have to ask. What was the stomach cramps like
Ed seems like an incredible dude. Nice, passionate, knowledgeable, funny, and apparently impervious to his own pepper, if watching him eat it is any indicator
So if he sat on this for ten years, what did he put in the "vault" just now? The Motherbox? The Singularity?
That was so violent! Lol
He may be in heat, but I don't think anyone will want to kiss someone with pepper X on their lips. 😂
Sean is so sincere that is what makes the show special
Congratulations to smokin Ed and whole team for the for the world record award from Guinness. It's always fun to see these four guys. You all made me laugh as soon as y'all are some Pepper X.  Much love to you all
Poor Klaus - he inherited this awful honor because of us.
I love Ed!! Nuff said.
Chili Claus is in heat and that Pepper X just f*cked him 😂😂
Ed is a straight up animal
Klaus lookin good
Amazing accomplishment to all that were involved!  Smokin Ed, Heatonist, and Hot Ones seemed loyal to each other from the jump and now are in the record books.  Congrats boys!
Sean looks like he did this one WAY better than the last one they did.. But Jesus that must be hot
I live less than 10 minutes away from Smokin Ed Currie's shop. I stop by every few months when I'm feeling brave. Nicest guy in the world.
I live near that farm.  There’s a small spice shop that sells their stuff. Really nice guys.
gnarly
PENCIL
The pain lol😂 I’m gonna try it eventually but I’m scared
but ..... just..... why?
Great timing, I just got my bottle in the mail today!
I'm convinced Ed pulled a Homer Simpson (when he ate the Guatemalan insanity pepper) and chugged an entire melted candle to line his mouth and throat before eating that pepper. ZERO reaction.  Congrats, Ed. Amazing work on not only the pepper but also on keeping it from all of the corpos and government drones. Never would have guessed there was chili pepper espionage, but also  somehow not surprised.
This ruld
It continues. . . xD
I'm actually afraid to touch my eyes or face just watching Chili Klaus -
Wicked cool
I want to see the  Sturniolo Triplets on the show
Good god that looks like some sort of mutant plant from Fallout!
Wow...I've never seen Klaus get wrecked before! That was epic.
Looks like satans eyeballs 👁️👿
Crazy how they found a great host and a guy that can take the heat in the same guy. Sean the goat
I love Ed. He is a national treasure.
first
2hrs of pure full body pain and burn is insane lol
Chili mothatfuckin Claus!!! Let’s go 🎉
Wimps.
"Did you invent that pepper?"  "Yeah"  "Why?"  😂
Congratulations Ed. While Ill never try one ( Habaneros are my limit atm ), I can appreciate your aim to be at the top!   Also to the Corpos trying to steal his peppers, f**king stop you god forsaken grubs.
This combo reminds me of a classic mortal combat move....FINISHER Some would say its hotter then my swedish cousin lol
Congrats Ed!
You need to change the neon pepper that shows the Scoville units from a regular explosion at the top to a mushroom cloud for that monster
these guys are such gluttons for punishment! ;0)
Guy is too obsessed with it all. “Gotta be the top” Great show. But the Ed guy gives off spectrum creeper vibes
Y’all need Coconut milk to help cool that down.
The Mount Rushmore of Spice!
I love you guys.  I used to think I liked hot food.  Heh.  I love to watch strongman competitions and i love to watch First We Feast.  This was incredible.  Chili Klaus rocks!!!
Not gonna lie that pepper looks scary af.
Klaus is my hero ,he is in heat baby ,lol....
9:50 Is that a modicum of fear in Sean's eyes>
Sean only eating a sliver! Leaving Klaus alone.
Klaus saying it tastes like oak and pencil cracked me up so bad. 🤣
13:49  Klaus: "Did you do that? Did you invent that pepper?" Currie: "Yeah." Klaus: ".....(weak) Why?"   Dead💀🤣🤣
Congrats Ed 👏  love when u guys all get together it's always a funny episode 😂
Guinness is definitely going to be issuing a copyright strike on this video lol
Good job Ed
I just want a bottle of that sauce
"I'm in heat" - best line ever!!!! Congratulations Ed.  Please give Klaus a huge glass of milk!  LOL
Sean I'm disappointed you didn't eat an entire pepper.
I feel so bad but I can’t stop laughing at their pain from eating the pepper 😂😂 I’m so sorry but Sean and Klaus are so funny together 😂😂
Majors and minors. Sounds very musical. Pepper X needs its own soundtrack.
I think you broke Chilli Klaus!!
This is the dumbest contest. They will eventually create a pepper that bleeds sulfuric acid.
This dude needs a dentist ASAP
Congrats! Don’t ever wanna taste it. But congrats!
I'm struggling to get through the Reaper addition, no way I'm trying that.
Go Ed!
Dang, Ed's like "just another day" when he calmly describes the mental images of the Pepper X eating process.
Yeah, because I take Carolina reapers 3 times a day, and I was really looking for a new challenge! 🤣
When can johnny get a box of these for a snack?
Why😂
Bruh I thought chili klaus was about to fall out fr 😂
All the episodes I've seen first. Time truly seeing the pepper x... WOW !!!
What a humble yet proud man. Ed you deserve the accolades of creator of the World's Hottest Pepper.
Wow that was extra hilarious at the end.  Ed needs to be a regular co host or something.
The legend, Chili Klaus
These men are insane LOL
Ed is a beast the way he handled it, no surprise being the creator of it. LOL "Klaus is breeding."
I don't want to see the next pepper he is secretly working on! Hats off to you smokin Ed!
I wouldn’t want to try the toilet experience of this
There better be some killer "I'm in heat!" tshirts out of this deal!  😂😂😂
Wonderful job
Kudos Ed!!! Look forward to the next pepper..❤ the show Sean
Klaus is making me so nervous the way he keeps touching around eyes
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Looks like the devils uncircumcised d***
I’ve been watching Ed for years and to see him break down was really impactful. The guy values what he does, lives and breathes it, so recognition must feel so gratifying.
The trio of heat 😅lol awesome job Ed and as a South Carolinian we are proud of you!!!  But I’ll pass on this one the reaper is plenty for me
Congratulations Ed!  You seem like a really good man and thank you Sean for putting this team in front of the camera.
Wow! Congrats everyone! 🎉 CHILI'S "I'M IN HEAT" HAD ME GASPING for aaaaiiiirrrr 😂🤣
WE NEED TAYLOR SWIFTTTT
Remember, these gentlemen are capsaicin deities. This pepper would probably make an average person beg for the sweet embrace of death
That spice is so dense the pepper is imploding from the gravity.
omfg the look on claus face... LOLOL
What I love about this. Is you see the vanity and being exposed by pain. And the man who had to endure and create something to make himself valuable expose simple men.
I'm tryna buy that orange Heatonist hat
This is great content
Klause says he’s in heat. That was the funniest part of the video. Danish people, and I know a bunch, are the weirdest, sweetest people. So modest, but very sure of themselves. And Sean? He’s like the GOAT wrt to interviews and food shows. Respect
That poor dear sweet man 😢😂
RIP ted barrus
Awesome, and I will never ever try that stuff.
Congrats Ed!   The hottest pepper I can handle is a mild jalapeño! 😂 My son would love your Pepper X though!
Why does no one react this strongly to the sauce? Does the sauce making process reduce the heat?
I've never understood why people do this. I literally felt like my head was burning.
I really need to see a Mexican, or Indian trying this. Gringos are weak
Never thought I’d see the day Klause meets his match
Congrats, Ed. Also....Klaus is "in heat".  lol
That may have been the best Hot Ones episode yet.
legend!!! happy for him
Why? Hahaha Why?
Get Si Robertson on this show!
“Burn in the front..party in the back “ 🥵
Ed trying to sympathize "Im getting a little bit a of a tear in my eye" as Sean and Klaus are in tremendous pain. 🤣
I mean, Klaus summed it up when he asked croakily, "Whyy?!" But it's still  cool to push the limits!
Awesome video
ed is a maniac..... god job to everyone involved. so cool
The pepper x version of the classic is so incredibly delicious, the only sauce anywhere near that hot that I crave and truly enjoy the flavor of. Congrats!
Chili Klaus!!!
"Everybody knows the three major ones"  Everybody: 👁👄👁
From the sounds of it, you should have named it Sadistic.
Ed has so much to be proud of.
Smoken Ed doesn't even look affected. Poor chili Klaus
Bathroom  going to be hard
"Whenever I see him I melt on the inside." NIce double entendre there Sean.
11:52 - Dr. Ed with the medical diagnosis on what is currently happening to Sean & Klaus was just added to the hilarity.
I have to try this sauce... I eat Carolina reaper on everything, I have Carolina reaper puree and fresh reapers that I mince and I eat them every day. My tolerance is high so I can enjoy the flavor and not die from the heat lol... But I've been wanting to get my hands on pepper x! Sounds like it tastes delicious!
Congrats to Ed and the puckerbutt pepper company on the Guinness world record for the hottest pepper
good on Ed he's a real cool dude.
Ed is calm this means there’s more in the war chest for sure Pepper X is the tip of the iceberg
This is absolutely one of the most wholesome important journalistic pieces of our decade. Watching Smokin’ Ed’s legit reaction, just as physically manifested as if he had eaten some of his own world-class product, brings me such joy! (Not to mention inviting our milder Scandinavian cousins…)
I'm in heat
Congratulations 🎊🍾🎉🎈 ED!!!
Ed is an absolute BEAST.
I missed Chili Klaus! Glad to see him back
That would send me straight to the shadow realm.
Ed cried more at getting the award than he did eating that pepper
Klaus: "but why?" Lol😂
Congratulations to Ed and everyone involved!! I love when people who love what they do get their flowers!
The whole thing is sick. And great. There’s no explanation.
Klaus F’ed up ! 🤯🥵
very cool guys!! i will never do that tho.
You could see Klaus' and Sean's faces get splotchy almost instantly. Redder splotches and pale yellow ones.
You are an incredible interviewer 🥂
Ed ate the New most hottest pepper like a banana pepper no sweat nothing my God. I thought Klaus and Sean Evans were goats at this, if anything Ed is Mewtwo
Bro this dude just munchin on the pepper while klaus is dying is hilarious
Oh noooooo, the host went Hollywood and got new teeth? Weren’t his teeth just fine?
I would love to see a behind the scenes episode about how he grew the peppers. Clarksons farm was a great show. Imagin that with chilies
Klaus has gone grey
I've gotten some of Eds sauces....theyre amazing. Not all bites are hot, some are just flavorful. Hes the man as his sauces are the perfect combo of hotness and flavor.
It's the embodiment of ouch my tongue.
I was afraid Sean wasn't going to eat it.  I'm glad he did (even if it was only a sliver).  If he ever stops participating then its time for the show to end.
"Why?"
If it makes a grown man admit he’s in heat I don’t want it. Lol
Why????
mike rowe come eat this 😂🤣
Nice 😢 😅
As soon as they ate that my stomach started hurting
get so happy when i see klaus like he's a personal old friend ive not seen in a while
Invite Matpat,. he thinks he found the absolute counter to hot peppers.
Congrats to Ed Currie. Now lets see how these stand up against the Chocolate Primo. The most underrated superhot ever.
Ed: "There's an intense burn that starts immediately" Klaus: 🥵🥵🥵
Ed looks like he ate a marshmallow 😂
You know it’s getting serious when Klaus starts snapping his fingers
How did they let Sean get away with not eating an entire pepper?
Congratulations on a job well done to you and all your team as as the growers and makers of this chilli well done and be careful😂😂😂❤
anyway you can reduce the shipping cost to canada? $27 USD for shipping is wild and makes it impossible to justify
That was such a lovely video. Thank you for sharing.
OK, one question .... is it hotter than Reaper Squeezen's .... ?  If it is, I gotta order a bottle.
I think rhett and link will need to try this pepper...
I love growing peppers in my garden, but this pepper LOOKS evil. Like an alien pepper, the colors and shape and texture. I probably won’t be seeing this in the garden…
Double up on that congrats to Ed and his team!  Phenomenal!  And what better way to announce the much anticipated NEW RECORD on First We Feast!!
This is awesome!
I'm so glad they keep making more videos together
"I'm in heat"  Chili Klaus  absolute legend
Thanks Ed and the rest of your team for all that you do!! I’m happy people like you exist! 🌶
YESSSSS! Chili Klaus!  I missed him on hotones
I love how they are talking about the flavors while people like me would consider this torture under Geneva Convention.
Ed turning into Jesse Ventura while the others start to struggle, lost it.
that orange hat activities vibe ❤
Congratulations 🎉
I watch everything on @FirstWeFeast with @ChiliKlaus
not gonna lie the guys 3 minutes in look like reptile actors. the chief and the kitchen renovation guy
Ed is the man, keep on chasing the heat🔥
Best episode yet!!! Imagine what Ed still has left in the chamber
Lets go! I had a reaper! It made me puke and sweat but what an experience though!!!
Ed just took it like nothing.. One explanation! Ed's a Zombie!
Congratulations!! I used to spend hours at the library going through the Guinness book of world records. Such a fabulous distinction!!
I didn't know Elon Musk started making peppers.
Can you please have sean Strickland on? From the UFC.  Would be a great interview
This is brilliant! Congrats to Smokin Ed! And thanks to Heatonist for making this video. What a great show these guys gave us! And how awesome that they brought Chili Klaus! Loved every minute of this 🔥🌶️
I love when you do content with Chili Klaus 😂 It's so fun to watch
Ed is a LEdGEND
I think I just experienced every human emotion in those 14 minutes
Chili Klaus is so wholesome I love him
Me just sweating eating jalapeño and cheddar chips here😅
I tried a sauce just today from a company in my area called 'Maestros Sauce Co.'. It was good stuff. You guys should try it on the show. I had the 'Roasted Ghosted Garlic'. Good stuff. Just a suggestion.
Ed didn't waiver.
would love to see david blaine try this and go "hmm"
Congratulations Ed
Did we really need to make the pepper X!? I mean the reaper was rough enough as it was...
Somebody needs to do a welfare check on Chili Klaus.  :)  I want to try it and I know I'll regret it if I do.
Ed looks like he just had a bell pepper, and Chili Klaus needs to go to the ER.
Maybe ya'll shouldn't do that 😂🥵
2,693 million on the Scoville scale!? That´s beyond insane! Well done! Congrats! Although I kinda agree with chilli Klaus here when asking WHY! I also would be ready to chew one if offered one! Lets the wave of recorded Pepper X eating uploads begin!
Starts at 10:40
Ed sitting here like this is just Tuesday.
Crazy
A Klaus and Ed collaboration in one single video 🤩
This man Ed loves his peppers gd
I wish you guys could get cravin capsaicin
Watching Sean eat a sliver while Klaus eats a whole pepper is like not putting a little extra dab on the Last Dab
Did Sean Evans just get Sean Evan'd by Ed Currie. (He dying while Ed had to take over for a bit to carry the conversation on.)
Congrats Ed! I bought Season 22 and I told my wife that was the hottest sauce on the face of the Earth. I've had it 3 times now and after the shock of the first Xperience you really get to enjoy the amazing flavor.  Salud'
Not making fun of Ed, but does hot peppers ruin teeth?
I always (wrongly) thought the massive security at Mr. Currie's facility was a publicity thing. I didn't know the science behind creating peppers. There are some good call out videos on the YT.
Congrats Ed! Looking forward to giving this pepperX a go.
Ed's from just down the way from where I am!  Cool to see him getting his notoriety!
That's an evil looking little fruit.
Ed’s “do I look just like Taylor Swift” while holding the plaque and a chili bouquet at the end was really just the cherry on top 😂❤ 🌶️ 🔥 we love you, Ed!
hope the Apollo doesnt take as long
Is Chili ok?
1. Sean laughing hysterically ❣ 2. Ed being surprised with the Guinness World Record🥲 3. Chili Klaus♥
Really great episode, so many outstanding moments. Thanks
Excellent video!
Why TF would they do this?????
You broke Chili Klaus
i can almost smell that bonnet citrus coming out of their noses~
Oh my God, you killed Chili Klaus!  You b@stards! 😆😅🤣😂
We need an update. I hope they are alive.
Ed, I accidently crossed Tabasco with Reaper, Habanero, and Ghost. It is instant hiccup, shooting juice like a tomato. I have 8 seeds I saved, didn't really think about cross poly while they grew... Or probably an accident cuz I just do not know chit, hottest fresh pepper I have ever ate tho. Anywho, thank you for continuing to bring the extreme, Much love.
i loved "it has no real throat burn like the reaper..... but that comes on later when you're in pain"  Soooo brutal! lol
Congratulations Smokin Ed! You can tell this means the world to him ❤
“I’m in heat.”
What an amazing accomplishment for such a humble group of guys! I really needed to see that there are still really incredible things happening in the world! Thank u
That "why" just echoed unending despair. I wish I could eat hotter stuff. I have trouble with a 6% Reaper sauce with black garlic. Better than I used to be but nowhere near where I wish I was.
Congratulations! Pepper X is number 1!
The first time seeing Sean and Klaus that nervous 😂 they were little nervous for the reapers but for this they were having second thoughts 😂
Everyone dying of the Pepper X Ed: I have a little tear in my eye.  You're a legend Smokin Ed.
*chanting slowly and building*  “behind the scenes…” “Behind The Scenes…” “BEHIND THE SCENES”  gimme gimme gimme gimme
Congrats Ed and team! I’m looking forward to trying pepper x in the next few weeks while in SC!
Ed is insane, he didn’t even flinch.
Bruh. That dude had no reaction
They just ate it and didnt flinch
Incredible. I would love to try one. I’ve eaten a dozen Carolina Reapers and they never disappoint. Can’t wait to get my hands on X.
Best video of the year
He said it tasted like a pencil 😅😅😅
Hilarious. Awesome vid
Ed's a very good friend, and a total madman. The world would be a much duller place if he wasn't in it. Greetings from Livingston County!
EPIC EPISODE~!!!
Awesome! Congratulations 🎉🎉🎉
The Spice Boys are back
hot damnation!
That old man the devil I'd be on th floor crying like a baby
Ed Currie reminds me of a real life Bubbles from Trailer park boys - such a pure human!
Poor Klaus. 2 hours........
Bro is it me or they turning yellow from all the Chile they eating 😅
I'm ready for it. 😁
It’s crazy to think he has hotter peppers just waiting to be released.
So proud of ED and his team!! Also huge thanks to Sean for bringing in klaus!!! Love his energy and his work.
I haven’t watched Hot Ones in a really long time, but this one took me back to when I used to watch every episode. I’m always down to watch Sean and Chili Klaus hurt themselves with insanely hot peppers. It’s pure comedy gold. Ed is an animal.
Holy Smokes, Ed just acted like he ate a lame Jalepeno Popper!  ~  LoL
That looks brutal
I’m in heat.. 😂😂🤣🤣.. chili klaus is always awesome
Just imagine the toilet visit after this
Ed earing that pepper while remaining coherent is so impressive.
Ed broke Chili Klause! When Chili said I’m done, you know that pepper is insane! Speaking of absolutely insane, Ed Currie is outta his mind, and I love him for it!,,
Ed is unhinged in the best way 😂 he likes to watch people be scared of his hot sauce.
"Now I am become death, the destroyer of stomachs....."--Smokin Ed Curry
Buddy has been smoking some of those peppers
I don't care why.
finally offical, now for the Apollo
Not a chance. I have too many pain conditions; that looks like I'd get twitchy and set them off.
Sean looks like he is going to cry the whole time
Pepper X. Because it's been ten years! 😂 very creepy lookin'
Love Klaus.
That pepper has diarrhea imagine what it would do to you 😅
Sean is a treasure man.  What a wonderful show you guys have here.  You can just see the love and dedication to the craft here.
So great to see Ed get the respect he deserves and then like a true champion leader acknowledges all the people that helped him get that award. Respect my friend
I was interested to read the Ed declared himself a "genius" and that he "babysat for a Pakistani prince" in a 2013 interview in the New Yorker. It certainly seems like a tall tale amongst many. I LOVE FWF and your format, it is disheartening to see that this person who has created so many stories and taken credit and declared himself the founder of what others have actually done the work to be a part of the mix. Thank you for all you do Hot Ones, love the interviews.
Ed just cracking jokes about Klaus breeding 😆 🤣 😂
i wanna see ed currie go up against johnny scoville
Sean Noooo 😂😢
I'm in heat.
I wonder what pepper x smells like when you cut it open
I love that Ed doesn't even flinch while eating Pepper X, but almost brought to tears for Pepper X being certified as being the hottest pepper 😂😂
My man chili. 😅
Ed is such a good person! I'm glad you all partnered up!
Oh man....how great to see Chili Klaus again!!!   And congrats to Ed for his new record pepper!
Congratulations Ed and the whole team!!!! Ed acts like it barely burns!!! Crazy
Bro on the right ate a stem lol
Chili is so handsome i can't stand it
Congratulations Ed and puckerbutt. I love what yall do.
“I’m in heat…” 😆
Represent South Carolina!!! I'm happy we can keep that title in our home state!!! Congratulations Ed and Puckerbutt Team!!!
Ed well-deserved that award, all the hard science and work put into this product must be incredible to be around. Congratulations!
This was the best video on YouTube. Love all these guys!
Chili Klaus's "I am in heat" at 12:28 had me rolling.
😂😂😂😂
Chili Klaus just flew all the way from Denmark just to die
Ed is the Man. “I think there’s some oak in it…” Then… Ed had a delayed reaction.
the im in heat at the end was epic LOL
Awesome ‼️👍
Pepper x the new botox
I'm in heat, where are my Scandinavian cousins? Congrats Ed your a mad scientist!
I'm so glad this maniac decided to make peppers instead of nuclear bombs
"That come later when you're in pain" im dead😂😂
I love everything about this.
There’s something really special about capturing so much emotion and love and all around brotherly love in this video. My heart explodes to see a beautiful representation of men’s feelings and vulnerability
at what point do these concentrates just become toxic for consumption
Looooooove this!  Congratulations Ed, huge accomplishment to you and your team.  Chili Klaus and Sean, much respect!
LOL...Ed's just loving the fear in their eyes as they cheers those Pepper Xs.  Great episode, and congrats to Ed and the Hot Ones team!
I thought the guest was going to be Gordon Ramsay. Ha ha.
It's straight up like they went from smoking distillate/kief-covered joints, to DMT
I think they broke Chili!  I absolutely love him and now I'm worried!
Lol, Sean ate the pepper and became French Stewart
🤣🤣 Id wear an "I'm in Heat🔥" Shirt with Klaus and Evans on it 🤷🏾‍♂️🤔
Chili Klaus is such a baller
I doubt that pepper X is the hottest. Guinness won’t test other super hot peppers unless you pay them $25’000 a year. There are likely hotter peppers like the chocolate primotalli or peppers grown by hellgarden or a number of small backyard gardeners who don’t have thousands of dollars for Guinness. It shouldn’t be about money but it is. Put your pepper up against the small growers or I think it’s rigged.
Straight up thought Ed was wearing a Captain D’s hat at first and I was so here for it.
Best sauces ever but it's $40 to get in Canada.
I knew it! The industrial pepper complex is out to get us 💀
Chilli claus is back!!!!!
Wouldnt you just steal peppers from the field it is grown in than the guy carrying a case of them?
PuckerButt in Downtown Fort Mill SC, I Love it being about 15 mins from my house
I thought the Apollo Pepper surpased than Pepper X.
wow! such a special episode! great to see you all together! congrats Ed!!!
the was a culminating moment in my life
poor guy
"I'm in heat!" best Klaus line ever.
I got acid reflux watching this lol
I’ve eaten stuff like this a couple times. The insane pain when it comes out is like nothing you can imagine. I’m talking screaming someone help me pain.
Biological warfare.
These guys are the real deal, wow.
Everyone focuses on the initial reaction when eating cuz it's funny. What aint funny is the diahrea that comes about 6 hours later. Would love to see an episode on that. Sponsored by Preparation H.
Purely delightful, esp the outtakes at the end. Smokin’ Ed is on another PLANET of pride in ownership. How he gnoshes the X or the Reaper like he’s just tiptoeing thru a pleasant backyard garden is a sight to behold. The right man doing the right thing as it perfectly suits his God-given talents! Thank you for this vid, FWF!🥵🫶🔥
Why build for heat first and flavor second? Flavor is everything. Number one. I live with two Jamaican sisters who can raise a few blisters. Every savory dish they make will contain the scotch bonnets and variants we grow. The purple bonnets that I brought from Jamaica are smoky and hot. We have a variety, some from Grace Co., sweet reds from a family grower in Portland Parish, gorgeous red hats. This obsession with heat first and flavor secondarily seems more of a dude challenge with alpha peppers than a culinary experience. If we can only put a tiny amount into a dish and lose the flavor, it seems a tail wagging a hot dog. Is this what men can produce? A bro hug is cool, but what is the cost? The cost is flavor. 2.6 million Scoville is only a bar to be beaten. 350 to 500 Scovillle  with amazing flavor is a dish to be eaten.
"I'm in heat"😂
I love this hot ones stuf
This video captures everything I love about the "Hot Ones Family/Project". Dedication, expertise, great personalities and friendship delivered in the most consumable format. Keep up the great work!!
I love when Klaus comes around!..
Don't do this to yourselves!!!! lol
Ed is such a sweet, sweet, cruel and crazy man 😂
I got the Season 22 set of sauces and took them to work (I work in a hospital) and challenged my coworkers…and I won by a long shot!
I’m the kind of guy that’s too scared to even try a Habanero, so the THOUGHT of something that hot is absolutely terrifying….but that’s such an accomplishment and it made me smile at how proud Ed is, very happy for him and I’m excited (and scared) to see if he’ll try again to make something even hotter than Pepper X. Congratulations!!!
Sean b*tched out
When Sean and klaus eat the crazy worlds hottest peppers together is pure gold 😂😂😂
I loved this episode!! ESPECIALLY when Klaus asks ‘did you invent this? (yes)…WHY?’ Cracked me up the way it was so natural and everyone else cracked up too. Well done and congratulations!!
All I can say is if it burned Ed for 3 hours.. I think I will pass on eating a whole one.. I watched Ed eat a whole Jalokia and just say yup, it's warm.. So Pepper X scares me.
That was absolutely spectacular.
congrats to Ed. my dude just tanked that pepper lol. i'd be on the ground crying/screaming.
My mouth is watering just watching this
🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
YOU ARE ALL LEGENDS 🫑🫑🫑🔥🔥🔥
I saw a 69 in the numbers and that made me 😊
Chili Klaus is the best
God, Chili Klaus just seems like a delightful fellow to be around, paired with Sean they are a dynamic duo I could just keep watching. I don't like that fact that Ed mentioned that there are people trying to steal his property. Who would try and do this man wrong? I hope all they all get explosive diarrhea and run out of TP.
Hottest sauces created by psychopaths.
So Sean IS human...fascinating
Yaaaayyyy Chili Klaus is back!!
Ed’s pepper X has been in the vault for 10 years. This guys has bred and eaten peppers twice as hot as his current world record. This was light work Ed the Extinguisher. Would love to meet him someday.
I'm in heat..........I'm in heat😂 That poor man
What a great guy….  Ive watched his docs before…. That pepper looks like true evil
"IM IN HEAT!" is my new tag line. Thanks Klaus.
what a pleasure for you to share this world record pepper crowning with us, Thank you First We Feast for this video and thank you Sean, Noah, and most of all Ed. You hard work is being recognized by the world in this video. Work well done and recognition deserved
i full clenched watching this
Yay chili Claus is back!
The best , why did you make that pepper 🤣🤣
Can’t believe Sean didn’t have a whole one. Brother and sister in arms maybe lol.
Simeone's going to die from that pepper....Wow. There could be a 3 million scoville pepper in one of his batches, Remember it averaged almost 2.7 Mil.
Ed gettin choked up before delivering an impassioned speech is such a great moment
This pepper is BARBBED!!!
Ed is a madman. Just no reaction after eating the hottest thing on the planet. Dude is scaaaaaaary. Congratulations on the record!
May God have mercy on our backsides. LORD HAVE MERCY.
Klaus: "I'm in heat...I'm in heat"🤣
Guys I think Chili is in heat.
🤣 Klaus not gonna forget that anytime soon...
Alternate universe of that pepper guy is a serial killer I just know it
"Did you do that, did you invent that pepper?"  "Yeah!"  "... why?"  I love Chili Klaus
They ruined poor Chili lol
Ed didn't "invent" pepper X.  He bred it.
it was awesome to see such a passionate reaction not only to the world record presenter but also to the presentation and ultimately the consumption of the pepper.
who else clapped for him!!!
Congrats to Ed and his team🎉🎉🎉🎉
Klaus got wrecked
Melt your face goodness > Melt in your mouth goodness
Im in heat😂😂
I'm in heat. Put that on your merch...and new hot sauce
Ed is such a genuine guy with love for peppers!
I put the first one on everything. It's delicious. I have the bomb too and I avoid that stuff. Although it's also good if you put a tiny bit in a lot of chili but for love of God don't use too much stuff Is poison
“Oh no, Klaus is breeding”  Now that’s a line
Ed is no Spice king, He is a SPICE GOD.
I felt a bit bad for Chili Klaus!  Great to see Ed's reaction to the plaque.
Somebody is going to the bathroom and blasting to the Moon....
I have a question. Are Ed's tears basically hot sauce?
Did Klaus survive?
“Did you invent that pepper?” “Yeah.” “Why??”
The bald guy is taking way too much after eating the pepper.
Hotter than his Scandinavian cousins 😂😂😂😂😂
Chilli Wonka
Ed is a mad scientist an the king of spice who gets off on ppl pain an chilli Klaus is awesome that pepper is smashing him an he says thank you for getting the opportunity to eat it
I’m in Heat 😂
with friends like these....
Dude...why am I sweating so bad?
Ring of Fire X
congrats ed!!!!!!!!!! honestly the host of the show should have ate a whole one. Tisk tisk Sean.
Klaus: I-I'm in heeat  Currie: Oh no, Klaus is breeding  chad response
Sean showing us what show business is like. You have to swallow something unbelievable every day and you are going to feel it in your a** in the morning.
This is amazing
A great video. Never seen Ed before, but it's obvious how passionate he is about what he does, and how much the respect and recognition means to him. Loved his reaction to the WR. Klaus is great. I've never laughed so much at a man in obvious and very real pain 😅
ED IS A MADMAN
Wow I'm surprised they let sean get away with not eating one. Especially with klaus!
If you give chili klaus a pepper x to hold he evolves
Are you able to buy individual peppers yet?
Is he still alive? Did he make it?
@1:47 y’all heard it here first, this dude is specifically looking for hot minors. Disgusting.
Congrats to Ed and his team! Excellent video. All you guys are awesome!
Generally I don’t feel bad in these situations. Having enjoy the last dab sans x,  my heart goes out to these gents
Poor Klaus..😂😂
Love this episode of Pepper X as I’m eating Strawberry Crumble Satisfaction Ice Cream!
Wow 😮
Congratulations Smokin Ed, we know you have been waiting for this for a long time and I never doubted you!!!
Worst of the worst eating ghost hot peppers 🌶️🌶️🌶️🤮🤮🤮
Klaus and Ed have tastebuds of steel. 🫢
It's a really beautiful fruit. Shame it's so dangerous.
To Smokin' Ed and the team, Congratulations!! It definitely took years of sweat and tears (quite literally 😂) to get this massive achievement, and it couldn't go to a more genuine group. The story about naming "Pepper X" was quite funny, especially now knowing how the name stuck 😂 I didn't expect an unveiling of the achievement coming, but what an AMAZING way to have it presented to you. A very emotional moment, and one that will be remembered for decades to come. Again, congratulations!!!!!
Klaus almost crying with the hotness while saying "I love the flavour 😭"
The fact that he mentioned big corporations are willing to pay people to steal his pepper for them is wild. He definitely needs to watch his back for mentioning that. He knows that the big corps are  watching him
SMOKIN!
Hey Sean. Can you have Jade Cargill as your guest?
I think Ed burned all of his tastebuds out and can mo longer feel the heat. 😂
Chili Klausssss!!! What. He's the most charming man in the world.
i ordered a bottle just now!!
So happy to see Ed finally get his record for Pepper X!
Oh my god I’m so excited about this video I am so glad Ed is on hot ones
Pepper X just looks like something no human should no be eating.  It just looks mean.
i'm so excited i need thiss for tacos
ed needs some crest whitestrips
"but that comes in later, when you're in pain" hahaha brilliant, I burst out laughing
13:49 poor Klaus 😂😂😂
I love just the absolute out of left field quotes from Chili Klaus.  "I'm in hea-" "Heaven?" "I'm in HEAT."
FINALLY
The crossover we all needed
They broke my boy.  They broke Chili Klaus.
Sean, you don't have to do this anymore. You've done enough. Just conduct the interviews. Would be funny though if you lived to 120 by eating the most hot sauce of anyone in the world.
I like how the peppers are looking more and more evil.
Well that made me smile. Thanks Ed :)
Smokin' Ed...our Low Country Legend does it again!!!!
There’s no crying in hottest peppers, wait, oh yes there is, tho involuntary.
What a legendary EP. Congrats Ed! Hello to the awesome Chili Klaus! Sean and Noah just on the standby dying.
Congrats Ed
Fact that ed didn't even flinch 😮. That guy must have a lava in his stomach.
That was awesome!
I feel like 0:07 perfectly sums up this pepper
this episode is goated 😭😭😆😆🐐🐐👑🔥🔥
Congratulations Ed and team!! I will NEVER eat that.🔥🌶️
Ed is crazy lol
"Yeah, Chili Klaus? We got like this super-duper ultra extreme pepper, and we want to spend ten grand flying you here so we can watch you eat it and suffer on camera for six minutes."
2,693,000 SHU 🥵🌶️🌶️
The craziest part is that Ed was holding onto the Guinness World Record for a decade in case someone decided to dethrone him. That's gangster lol.
Klaus is hilarious 😂😂😂
I feel like this is what the inevitable heat death of the universe will feel like.
ed ate it and showed off "all i got is a single tear" bruh does he not feel heat anymore? 🤣
my favorite episode yet 😄😄😄
This was amazing.
I thought that was prince harry at first lol
Ed Currie is a fraud.
Respect
WHY DIDNT YOU EAT A WHOLE ONE SEAN
Kind of gutted that you didn't get Jonny Scoville on
3:26 Culinary purpose? None, of course. It’s just for BS like this.
I'm in heat
What turn around for smoking ed wow i love pepper's
Congrats to Smokin' Ed Currie well deserved. :)
GOOD JOB ED!!!!!
Ordered the 10 pack after watching, can't wait
Seeds for sale wen?
No thank you I can barely eat habanero.
Never tell a Thai chef light me up... I don't know what he put in my curry but son of a... He got a good laugh that day
This is so awesome for them, congratulations guys!🥹
Careful I heard that pepper can get you in heat.
Huge respect for Chili Klaus. He's fearless.  I wouldn't do it.
Out of all the amazing episodes you have put out this stands among them in greatness. 4 legends making a legendary video!
this is the best episode of Hot Ones hands down.
I'm sure you could butter bread with Smokin' Ed's teeth.
Fantastic episode.
Klaus snapping his fingers and his Clint Eastwood squint is the best part of watching him eat peppers. 😣
Well played to you all and a big CONGRATS! You're notes on th flavor was like describing a whiskey's flavor profile. So, we just ordered a bottle to try...and we can't wait to taste the new flavors.
I clicked on this for a quick watch just to see Ed and I’m glad I clicked. This was super sweet to watch. Heatonist really is a dope institution and Hot Ones has evolved into such a beauty family. Loved  this.
I wish Ed would stop dressing like a slob.  He seems like a smart guy and has a great business.  Would a button down hurt?
It actually hurts me to see Chili Klaus in so much pain. He's too nice for that level of pain. :(
I would have respect for Ed had he not stole the reaper and called it his own to begin with! For that this guy is forever a fraud until he admits it!
🎉congrats🎉 Ed 💪😎
Light one for Ed 🔥👍
Master Pepper 🌶  is calm, cool and collected. Everyone else dying in the complete 'heat' takeover 🫢🔥🥵
"So what's the culinary purpose for this pepper?"  "Oh, no. I just like the fear."
Poor klaus
Well spoken ed
Caroliner reaper is not even a little bit hot. It has a slight tang that is all!
Any video with Chili Klaus is comedy gold. "I think there's some oak in it.... and...  some pencil" 😂 And congrats to Ed!!!!
Best episode ever
pure insanity all around, A+
This made me eat 5 Thai peppers 🌶️
the finale is absolutely hilarious especially Sean attempting a showbiz to-camera sell while Chili Klaus is just flopping around behind him
I want some
Bob Ross of peppers
Honey! New pepper just dropped!
They have to sneak that pepper in on these celebs
This is truly his life's work and passion, I respect and admire that so much.
Kids don't do drugs! do peppers!
This was a fantastic episode. Keep dabbing!
Can you imagine being Ed Currie? Eating and creating the hottest peppers on the planet like it’s just another career. What an incredible dude
"Did you invent that pepper?" "Yeah" "Why?"
"Do i look like Taylor Swift?" 😂
Hey Ed, I love the Nugget Honey. Pepper X is wicked!!
You should make a hottest hot sauce gauntlet episode with Ed! I’d love to see the look on Sean’s face 😂
9:12 here’s the wild facts
I think you guys finally broke chili...
Puckerbutt. Lol. Brilliant.
Ed is a savage
skip skip skip skip oh woweee a world record skip skip skip skip okay they finally ate it nice
So awesome congrats Ed!
eating the pepper starts at 10:40
My boy Klaus is a beast
"It continues" ... yes, for about two hours lolllllll not the words you wanna hear when all you can say is "I'm in heat" lolllllll
Thank you for getting the band back together to celebrate Ed, Noah and their crew's incredible achievement. Chili Klaus is a one-of-a-kind warrior of the spice. Sean knows he owes Klaus, him eating a full Pepper X pepper on a future program together with Klaus. Muhahahaha...GREAT episode.
@FirstWeFeast X is Elon Musks favorite letter. I would love to see him on Hot Ones!
Ed is unbelievable. I don’t even know what to say.
Going to have get some seeds when available. In the middle of fermenting some garden peppers for hot sauces. I'd like to grow some of these to add that insane heat and flavor.
We love smoking ed
been wondering what happened to chili Klaus, great video, super enjoyable. Sean, why do you keep doing this to yourself?  lol
Congrats Ed! I hope Klaus is ok after this.
Why am I tearing up
Ed seems like such a good, wholesome person. I get very good vibes from him.
Chili left his Scandinavian cousins back at home! How dare 😅
Did you invent that pepper? Yea... ...why?
The return of Chili Klaus 🥹
10:14 "I'm not gonna hurt you, Klaus." ...but Pepper X will 🤣
Chili Klaus is back!!!!
I wonder if he'll ever make a pepper that's just straight up too dangerous for people to eat lol
Can't wait for Rhett and Link to do this challenge. 😂
Exciting for Chili Klaus to be the first person, other than Ed to eat a Pepper X. But also, poor Klaus :( i wish you a swift recovery!
“Did you invent this pepper? “W’yeahhh” “Why?” 😂 I’d say the same thing if I don’t die
Legend has it, if you wear a cap you will be able to handle the heat.
Chilli Klaus is my favorite! 😂🤣😂
Klaus is a Legend though. Ready for any hottest chillies of the world 🎉
If chili is in heat, lemme hit dat
Noah sounds like he’s got a terrible cold in every video I see him in.
They're going to regret not wearing gloves...............................
So these guys basically want people to hate spicy food and all but die. Got it
Legendary.
Aww Poor Chili.
I love spicy food and heat..but this?  No thanks..rather you spent time designing the most delicious coffee or something..lol
I would love to get a chance to try this pepper,  The sauce is very good, but I imagine it'll never compare to the raw pepper.
I have really missed Chili Klaus on this channel!
Congrats on All your hard work and sharing to the world 🌎
Reminds me a lot of the Mustard Naga's I've grown this season.
You should do this and get a brain scan
We miss you and Chili Klaus. Would love to see more frequent episodes with the two of you...
Great episode!!! Definitely ordering a bottle.
Im in heat song
That's not the Sean I know and love. He only ate a sliver!!
Ed has just the right amount of sociopath in him to do this.
Love seeing it, you can tell just how much this all means to Ed and his team! Especially love seeing you guys support these family businesses as well!
He said it lasted two hours!!! 😮😮😮😮
I have Apollo sauce in the fridge.... its beyond hot its painful.. i do not know how you guys did this. pepper X is way too hot for me.
Ed just straight chilling while everybody else is imploding on camera hahahahahaba
Amazing. I would never!
ed standing there casually eating the pepper, while the others suffer
If aliens show up and they are into spicy things, at least we know who the ambassador would be.
07:05 That was super neat. Happy for you Ed! That episode was so good. I wish it was longer.
Jesus that thing was so hot that Klaus barely did his heat snaps or rub his earlobes. Killer pepper.
Would like to listen to more about who is trying to steal his peppers.
A pepper that overwhelmed Chili Claus is not a pepper, it's a food-based chemical weapon.
I am gonna make a pepper spray out of this
You'd think with all that money, Ed could afford a proper dental program.
Always a pleasure to see Chili Klaus
I ate a whole carolina reaper pepper a few years ago, my stomach pain was brutal, i feel for these pepper gladiators 🙏
🥵 Ohhhh it finished Chille Klaus. It's gotta be a monster if it floored the legend himself.
Ed is built different. Wow.
I live vicariouosly through them here, as I'll never be heating something that hot....hopefully
How tf is Ed so calm!!!
Its official. Sean is chasing the high from spicy. Yes you can get high from spicy
Sean didn't eat a whole one huh..... lame
Congrats to Ed Currie! Well deserved!
Laughed so hard when Chili Klaus said "I'm in heat". 🤣😂 What you guys share the experience was really fun.
Spicyyy! 🔥
Ed is a terrible person who bought a record. This is a total scam!
niiiiice
I need an Xperience bottle 😍
CHILLI KLAUS IS BACK!!!! Thank you Sean for answering our calls to bring him back!
Seems worse than Da Bomb, wonder if it will finally get replaced
Carolina Reaper and Ghost Pepper are such badass names. Pepper X sounds like a deodorant.
Ok. Just pause on that shot of the pepper with his GWR plaque. Anyone else getting "danger" vibes? I would rather eat thermite than shoving that pepper hand-grenade in my mouth and pulling the pin. I'm crazy but y'all are insane, truly touched in the brain.
❤
Ed is Lord Beerus. Sean & Klaus are Goku and Vegeta
I see chili klaus i click simple as that
I knew something would be on YouTube about this
First we fea… watch adverts.
I love how Ed just isn't bothered by the pepper. 😂
will be interesting to see how this destroys Brian Ambs :D
In about 2018 at the California hot sauce expo I ate a piece of this pepper with Ed. A tiny little itty bitty piece. I thought I was going to die. Ed thought I handled it pretty well. He didn't see me 20 minutes later. THE END!!
This is such a cool episode.
Wow this was awesome guys.  Congrats to Ed! what a long road and achievement.   Well done to everyone for their support bringing this new chilli to the world.  Wow so happy to see chilli Klaus again he warms my heart and always makes me smile.
It kinda made me mad when he stated big corporations are trying to steal his recipe. Illuminati confirmed
Sean and Klaus are hilarious together. I love them.
There is no excuse for not having Klaus' back, I feel personally let down by Sean, unless he's pregnant that was a dereliction of duty.
Ed: Even though I don't look it, I'm feeling like Klaus right now. Me: I don't believe you, Ed. You must have an iron stomach to beat all stomachs, dude. You were talking normally and smiling away, while everyone else was dying. (Lol!)  You're amazing.
Ed is such a blessing.
epic !
I never thought that I'd tear up watching, congratulations to Ed and his crew!! And Chili Klaus... we love you 😍
"I'm in heat!" "This is more hot than my Scandinavian cousins."  Whenever Chili Klaus comes on, he just casually drops a one-liner for the ages. Absolute legend.
At 13:58 when he says "do i look like Taylor Swift" lol
Absolutely first class. Amazing video! This is the content that sets this channel apart from any other.
When a person gets successful, it is common to feel a bit envious of what they accomplished. But not with Sean, I'll never dream of having what he has right now, because if eating extremely spicy food can be a career then count me out. It is why I only feel proud of him for what he accomplished. He totally deserves it, not only for this extreme tolerance to spicy foods, but also to his excellent talent in interviewing.
Ed looks like hes blowing up realllllllllllllly slowly
love seeing how excited ed is true passion !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Klaus is in Esther ya’ll
New world order
"Did you invent that pepper?" "Yeah!" "Why?" 😂😂
A Slice PepperX should be optional for the Brave Ones, when they make it through HotOnes!
The closest I'll get to watching dark web torture videos.
Now he can afford some toothpaste for his yellow teeth
Tuned in to see the peppers. You guys are cool too
Closing it out with “I’m in heat” I lost it 😂😂😂
“Im in heat” oh nooo he is breeding lol had me rolling
finaly they hangout again :D
Ed being so calm makes me laugh so hard
Ed is a ducking psychopath...
Man with pure passion, well done
the primotali is the hottest pepper. not whatever that is
Can we buy seeds
I’m convinced the inside of Ed’s body is made of pure asbestos
Sean ALWAYS says he's never doing this again but yet he does
Great vid, gents!
Is it the hot sauce that gives Sean an absolutely perfect complexion?
GREAT episode and what a beautiful moment for Ed. As a fellow dane im so proud of Chili Klaus.
Chili Klaus is back yay! I've missed him so much
Andy Glass looks like a crypto bro who is about to swindle Ed out of his retirement savings.
Congratulations! That's an incredible accomplishment, but 2,693,000 scoville? That's a weapon!
Chilli Clause!! Brings back iconic episode moments
Chili Klaus couldn't even snap right it was that hot!? Holy sh..
Phew, I started sweating just thinking about the spice
We get high af and name em😂 Ed I was a fan before, but you just made me love you even more
This is the best hot ones video in a long time.
Chili Klaus IS A LEGEND
First We Feast!  That was awesome guys!!
Wait, this isn't Taylor Swift!
Ed makes me feel really proud if my dental routine.
The goal is to create tasty pain and suffering.
"Did you event that pepper... WHY?"
When Chili Klaus walks off screen, dying, you know that was a rough one. And I love him asking Ed "Why?" at the end there.
Love you guys you are doing a great job! But, not gonna lie, Sean should have eaten the pepper X with Klaus.
Smokin Ed, the man that put Chili Klaus in heat.
Ed that man LOVES his work
How is he just cool as a cucumber
I loved this and I would love to get my hands on a Pepper X. I wouldn't just scran it down, I'd create a delicious breakfast.  Spinach, herb and Pepper X omelette  Make an omelette with 2 eggs, 2 tablespoons trim milk and 2 cups baby spinach, and one large, uncut pepper x placed lovingly in the centre. Fry until the omelette is omeletty, then peel up the sides of the omelette over the devils pepper in the centre, until it resembles something like an eggy pod thing. Feed it to people you hate and enjoy the scenes.
Oohh I thought the Apollo sauce had X in it for some strange reason... so what is the Scoville of Apollo then? It doesn't list it on the Heatonist website
Any time Chili Klaus is on, it's always hilarious and sweet
Finally some REALLY SIZZLING content!
Klaus makes me proud of being Danish 😂🔥
Was wondering when pepper X would get the crown, congratulations to Ed on the huge acheivement!
Is there any ABU type of number for best tasting hot sauce? I feel like the hotness is just non-sense. I can add gasoline to Tabasco and have same affect
Hey yall should get the YouTuber bigjigglypanda on this show
I imagine Chili Klaus is trippin'  like Homer Simpson when he ate the hot pepper.
*(Klaus convulsing, in heat, breeding, snapping)* **Ed Curry narration continues**
This episode was for the lore lovers 💀
Awesome
Can't believe you guys are all standing for this. And Klaus kept touching his face!
I really wish no one would have anything to do with Smokin' Ed Currie who initially broke the record by stealing.
amazing work to Ed and he's gang...keep it going!
Chris, a hot ones like question for you, if you could have anyone on the show that is no longer with us today, who would it be?
Why do I feel like I could do this. No money for proof. I could for myself
left my guy hanging at 11:25 lol
Baylan Skoll took that extremely well
Ed just causally eat his is INSANE. This man is not human
YESSSS THE DREAM SPICE TEAM IS BACK !!! LFG ❤️🥵🔥
so good to see Claus back
Just tried habanero sweet pickles😮 yikes hot
thumbnail looked like some dank kush
as a  small  scale sustainable farmer,  i frigging LOVE Ed's energy.   effing TOWANDA, dude!
How many of us just skipped to when they ate it 😂😂😂
Ed’s voice shaking more thanking the team than after eating the pepper is insane
I had to go back to confirm that Ed actually ate one of the peppers also because he's super chill while the others are going out of their minds. 😅😅😅 Give him a crown for that also.
Congrats to once again the hottest pepper in the world perfect timing for all of the haters to shutup and drown in there jealousy to👏👏👏👏💯
I'm still confused about the Scoville unit
Ed’s a beast. Man is breaking down the flavor profile while the rest lost the English language. 😂
!!!CHILLLLIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII KLAUSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS MA BOI IS BACK!!!
Everybody was swinging high af by the end 😂😂
On the upside, hereafter Sean can coast through _Da Bomb_ like it ain't no thang.
Ed reacted more to the award than the pepper.
This was impeccable. With so many legends on the screen you know it's going to be an amazing watch!
I feel somewhat concerned for your rear exits 😮
This is a top 10 video of all time.
I love this so much more than a lot of the recent guests on the show
Congrats Ed! I am so happy for you brother! I can't wait to try this pepper!
“There is no throat burn” “actually I have throat burn”
Wonder what the cramps are like from that
The boys are absolutely fried in this one
When Klaus said "Ooooooooo" 😂💀
No God No!! I just used this to make chili for chili dogs. It is 1 hor and 40 min  later  and i can finall see well enough to type. I loved the flavor for maybee 4 seconds. I used too much hot Sause in the chili and then used too much chili on the hotdog. It feels like the skin on my shoulders and neck is stretched too far and made out of wood. The hiccups are mostly gone. What happens later is scary to think about. Just ..never mind , I gotta go.
Fantastic team of chilipepper eaters 😅💪
Klaus: having full body spasms, entering a new reality, a higher plane  Ed: giving a Carl Sagan like description of the pepper and it's effects with no visible pain
Royalty!!!! So great!  Sacrifice for our entertainment but we appreciate it so much.
I’ve been waiting soooo long for THIS. Thank you everyone who made it possible.
Sweet baby Jesus! :)
Sean looks like david beckham yk
WHY DID SEAN EAT A SMALL PIECE, WHILE POOR KLAUS ATE THE ENTIRE PEPPER???  THAT'S MESSED UP.  But congrats to Smokin Ed. And everyone involved  👏👏👏
This is my favorite First We Feast video now.  The reactions were hilariously great, and of course congrats to Ed for topping the pepper charts again!
I must have accidentally rubbed my eyes with a little bit of Reaper Squeezin's cause they watered up when Ed accepted his Guinness award.
We need Johnny Scoville of @chasetheheat on here, please!
CHILI KLAUS!!
Baller.
This is so wholesome. Love it
That looks like a nuclear pepper 🫑
Ed just enjoying them burning like they are on the surface of the sun, and ed isn't even phased by his own pepper. What a stone cold chili killer.
You gotta get Sam the Cooking Guy on here
Woooh! That was awesome! Chili klaus getting convinced to eat that by ed was priceless, he said "the first one? ok. *pop*!"
😂 that was fun
Just shy of 2.7 million scoville. Paqui ghost pepper chips are just about my limit for heat, so I'm pretty sure this pepper would destroy me.
Actually quite touching to see a person achieve something they didn't know was about to happen. Gave me the tingles
The guy in the right is just Sean evans with hair.
Sean & Edd broke Chili Klaus..... he's never gonna come back
I remember subscribing to this channel, i dont even know how many years ago, when you guys had like 30k subs and only started hot ones. Seeing where this has lead, never ceases to amaze me. I wish you all the best in the world and thank you for your content from the bottom of my heart <3
Ed is an icon! He's so passionate and it shows. Congratulations 🎉 Love y'all
Having previously eaten Pepper-X, in sauce form, I can confidently say that I enjoy it's flavor MUCH more than any Carolina Reaper. It still burns me about 20 seconds later. But tastes much better!
Easy Red Savina will provide medium heat maximum flavour
I wonder if he could get a contract for pepper spray. Pepper X Self Defense Spray!
You have got to love my fellow dane, Chili-Klaus, asking the real question here: "Why?"!
"did you invent this" "yes" *dying whisper* "why"   love it. gonna order some.
Congratulations! That hot pepper was created with love and knowledge from a farmer ! Not Mosento! Will never eat it but very happy about your success!🌶🌶❤️🤘👌👍👊❤️
Anytime Sean and chili klaus come together it’s a great video …..my favorite duo I would recommend for celebrity death match vs chili x
i love how smoking ed is just chilling like a supervillain in the background as klaus n sean just talk for a while 😎😈 lol love you guys  awesome work on making the pep x debut 🥳🌶️🔥😮‍💨
Santa Chili Klaus is hilarious 😂
Ed talking about how he likes to see the fear in people’s eyes when they eat his hot sauce was deeply unsettling…
So epic to see all of my favorite pepper heads at one place again!. Congratulations everyone! To celebrate I'm eating a mix of 8 super hot dried pepper flakes with my dinner!  Cheers boys and girls!!!!!!! 🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶
Does anyone have a link to the data? Guinness can say whatever it wants but I'd like to see the test results. Something this big should be accessible, don't you think? Mainly to shut people like me down, so where is it?
Oh i feel so bad for them but not ed. He made this monster lol but poor Klaus. He looked like that poor politician he had on his show, the one that didnt want to puke on camera 😂
Propepper X would have been even better 🤣
The word "hero" is thrown around a little too commonly these days, but...
Chili Klaus is a BEAST!!!!
Should’ve brought in Jenna Ortega!
Good to hear it's finally official. Way back at this show's debut, it was suggested that Pepper X had dethroned the reaper and then nothing else as said about it for years. I thought Apollo was the new official name of pepper x. Now I know Apolo was just another super hot, like the reaper version of The Last Dab.  Congratulations, Ed! You're the one and forever pepper king.
Smokin Ed definitely tortures people with peppers
Im surprised you dont suffer from gastritis
I beat the reaper pepper challenge and it was horrific but the next morning it was worse
Yes.  But was it Fruity?
Shout to Ed for his and his team amazing achievement🎉🎉🎉 klaus had me dying laughing when he said "I'm in heat" 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ed is the GOAT of heat.
This guy has bodies under his house no doubt.
Ed is a beast, everybody is in extreme pain and he chews on the Pepper X like its a gummibear :O
First 2 persons in the world to eat a whole pepper X... congrats and of them is a dane..
Ed's not human 😂
I see you ed ! Well deserved! Love your peppers !!!
The look and color of that pepper look very ominous. It screams, "Don't eat me."
It's been like 7 years since the last one
Free Palestine 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
Ed looks like he ate an apple lol
The legend is back!!! Elsker chili klaus 😃
Amazing video
If only Ed was as enthusiastic about a toothbrush as he is about his peppers
If you're gonna do something, anything in life, why not try to be the best. Congratulations Ed.
Evil looking pepper
I think you guys just Killed Chili Klaus 😢
I’m honor of Chili Klaus I always snap my fingers when eating something hot 🌶️
loved how moved he was when presented with the plaque
This is awesome, I didn't think it was a scam but after hearing about pepper x for years and never seeing one I began to think it was just a bornd of peppers or something. Excited to see Johnny scoville get his hands on one of these
I want to like this video more than once. Lol
Not going to lie... super nostalgia with Chili Klaus! Great video! Congrats to Ed and the entire team at Puckerbutt on the GWR!
Chili Klaus' "did you do that? Did you invent that pepper?" Ed: yea Chili Klaus: *why 😫*
If he's pullin' this out does that mean he has an even hotter pepper as back up?
I got high with them by just watching that xD
11:13 look at ed's grin right there lol. he loves inducing the pain!!
Also the ugliest pepper in the world also 😂.
I´m not gonna lie. Smokin Ed has the look of someone who has killed one or several men and has gotten away with it.
This was such an awesome video, from Ed getting choked up receiving the award to him bulldozing through the pepper like its nothing 😂 Chilli Klaus is such an entertaining watch too 😂
I'm not sure we should be congratulating Ed. It's like congratulating Oppenheimer.
Klaus is in heat
Is the pepper X a Trinidad scorpion pepper cause I use to grow them.
Seeing how they reacted to a sliver, Yeah nah I'm good
Why does this guy even have a show if he only eats a sliver of a pepper and his guests out do him?
God bless 🙌
You guys are are freaking nuts
I know they’re his peppers, but Ed is still a savage for eating that whole pepper and not even blinking an eye
Been waaay too long since Chili Claus was here.. Thank you🎉
Ed ate that pepper like nothing wow!
It makes me so happy to see Chili!
Very happy for Ed, Andy, and their team for their accomplishments and achievements 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Congratulations Ed. You totally deserve it my dude. May the gods forever bless you with good harvests. I could only dream of getting to your level
Chili Klaus! Oh man this is such a special episode
These fellas just BUILT DIFFERENT and I love it! Congrats Ed 🙌
Now why not cross the Pepper X with the Apollo and make and even hotter pepper.
Chili Klaus with the Viking bravery.
Now someone hold an event for the Guinness record of eating the most Pepper X !! I've seen the Carolina Reaper events.
That was f’in awesome! Congratulations to Ed! Is Chili ok?
"It's very spicy" ~Chili Klaus
everyone instantly dying 🥵meanwhile Smokin' Ed is just chewing away w/ ease 🤷‍♂🤷‍♂🤷‍♂
lol ed with a straight face.... this guy is a monster.... in all the best and worst ways...
I find it amazing that Ed barely reacts to it. I think that like anything you consume over time, you build up a tolerance to it.
He is right. Da Bomb is a good example of a disgusting hot sauce that is just hot to be hot.  A really good hot sauce should also taste good once the burn dissapates.
I can watch those two eat hot peppers all day😂
Just LAST NIGHT I introduced my gf to chili klaus/Sean evans and smokin Ed. This is insane. Lol
Ed eats that whole thing and reacts like i would to tabasco sauce, jesus christ on a motorbike! 😮
Smokin' Ed Currie is a broken man. He's the guy that would get bear sprayed and suggest it would be a delightful ice cream topping.
Chilli Klaus might be the biggest alpha in the world
Chilli was crying😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
🔥🔥🔥🍻🍻🍻☠️☠️☠️
Ed Currie looks like he has eaten so many spicy peppers that he has ruined his life. You know when someone has been tweaking for years and they smoke a bowl of crystals...no reaction. That's what has happened to Smokin Ed Currie....lol
Thants what i needed to see today, thank you. You made my day
Finally Ed gets validation.  All I’ve heard for so long was that that he was bs but the 3 last dabs I’ve tried are great.  Congratulations Ed and team ❤
how is Ed not dying? are their capsasin receptors not as active? lol
You could just feel the dread in Sean's eyes and tone while they were bringing out the peppers
Shoutout Smokin Ed
We have never been disappointed with these videos. Great
I'm in heat
Is sean getting off the spice train?
Torture to my ear and stomach 😂😂😂 bit I love the show
that was awesome!!!
Haha yes! Love the TSwift reference at the end
Pepper X looks poisonous.
The Apollo Last Dab was one of my favorite tasting sauces.  Heat with some flavor.  Looking forward to trying it.
Kinda bogus you didn't do a whole pepper too lol
RIP Klaus, lol
Made me start an order for the season22 pack  tomorrow  ill finish that orser 😎
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🥵KLAUS🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
hmm when he said the feeling goes up the back of your head, made me think of horseradish/wasabi.
I couldn’t have asked for a better combo than Sean, Klaus, and Ed.
Missed Chili Klaus!!!! His line “ I’m in heat” 😅😂🤣 too good. Congrats on the Guinness achievement 🙌🏻
What happened to Apollo pepper??????????????
I only found out recently that patenting pepper strains is extremely serious business. Peppadew peppers are only allowed to be grown in one specific part of South Africa, and the farm that has the patent on the strain has armed guards protecting it.
Huge shout out to Ed and the puckerbutt team for your amazing achievement of creating the verifiably hottest pepper in the world!
This is like a peppers avengers team
Yessss!!
Klaus: Did you do that? Did you invent that pepper? Ed: Yeah. Klaus: Why? 😆🤣
THEY KILLED KLAUS!!!!
Such an awesome special!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
These guys are insane
That’s fun to watch but I ain’t gonna do it! I have the heat tolerance of a two day old!
That's my Uncle Smokin Ed he's the best.
This is the best kind of content Hot Ones makes. Really wish Sean had also eaten a whole one 😂
13:50 That was hilarious. „Why?“ 😂😂😂
You're the man Ed!
Rhett and Link have to try this
Alien archaeologists will find this on some abandoned server, and they will then have no doubt that humans died by their own hands.
Why don’t you deliver the game Truth or dab in France?
lol The Guiness Records have been proven time after time that they are just a money grabbing company with no credibility whatsoever.
If things keep going the way they're going, in 10 years, the last dab isn't going to be a hot sauce. It's just going to be a police officer who walks in and pepper sprays Sean and the guest.
<3
Ed is such a cool guy. Klaus is crazy. Sean is smart for not eating a whole pepper. Poor Klaus.
I’ve missed this chilli klaus and Sean episodes always entertaining
The pepper looks like its growing thorns. I'm convince he's going to grow one with devil horns
More Klaus plezz
Congrats Ed and team! Y’all killed this ish!! 💪🏾 Guinness here we goooooo!!!!!!
I died when Chili Klaus said I think there’s some oak in it 😂
The first time in my life I heard the word "adjudicator", was in John Wick 3. The 2nd time? Pepper X: Sean Evans, Chili Klaus & Smokin' Ed Currie Eat the New World's Hottest Pepper.   What a weird world
I’m in heat 😂😂🤣🤣🤣😂🤣💀💀
I had a quarter of a reaper a few weeks ago and I got the sympathy sweats watching this.
the avengers assembled
Hahahhahaha
It's nice to see a dude so passionate about his product that he is willing to fight major corporations to maintain control and ownership of it.
It's nice to see Sean suffer a little. We don't get that often
"Did you invent that?" "Yes." "Why???"  I felt that sentiment.
Genius idea for a video…
them bills were hot GO BUFFALOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I wonder how tastful this one will be chili clause lol
Congrats to Smokin' Ed Currie, the Puckerbutt Team and the Heatonist! Ed, you went in against the odds, you proved them wrong, by showing what dedication and resilience can achieve! I will definitely scoop up some sauces!
Nobody can explain the Scoville Scale, because it's total nonsense.
Nobody wants it. Pepper X is such a pathetically weak Pepper. So many other experimental peppers that are hotter and more flavorful.
I think Ed broke Claus :)
Ed seems like such a sweet guy. Congratulations to Ed and the rest of his team!
You should’ve had Andy Glass eat pepper!
Heroes in the heat! Way to go Ed!
Mr. Klaus i salute you for your bravery Mr. Ed you are a genius i cannot wait to try one for myself.
"I am in heat" **proceeds to find some lioness to devour**
Så fedt at se Chili Klaus på sådan en stor platform! Det dælme hygge!
I can't wait to be in heat too
He’s a beast
Ed is such a legend. Driven and passionate but so down to earth. That's one badass pepper.
I enjoyed this so much. Had me laughing so hard 😂 Chili Claus is amazing. And hats off to everyone for trying it. Hot Ones is the best. Congrats Ed 🎉👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Chili is back! More Chili Klaus
"I'm in he...." "Heaven?" "I'm in heat!"
I feel like Chili Klaus saying "I'm in heat' was basically a sanitized version of saying "I think I have fallen into the fires of the eternal inferno and their flames are consuming my every cell."
Love this content. Three greats together. Awesome.
Love to see someone get the praise for their hard work and dedication.
Love this. Get some Last dab to the UK!
Tastes like acid
Why does Pepper X look like it was grown in soil fertilized by hate and xenomorph compost?!
This is like the Spice Mount Rushmore
This is so great.
I was sweaty just by watching this video
11:45 "and..... pencil 😭"
❤
The pantheon assembles...
that was so enjoyable. thank you.
I would Die! I can barely handle a Jalapeno. I'm such a light weight.
"Did you invent that pepper?" "Yeah...?" "Why?!" 😂😂😂
Nah Sean’s unreal, he’s pretending it hurt but let’s be honest
congratz!!!!!
Congratulations! I got goosebumps with Ed.
Sean's face looked as tight as it felt, for once it wasn't a chili-induced hallucination.
Ed is the Scoville king! He seems to eat peppers for breakfast...
I loved the Apollo sauce. Only had it like 5 or 6 times, though. It's interesting that he mentioned the flight reflex because yes, you want to run away, you feel like you HAVE TO MOVE. But you can't run away. You feel imprisoned in yourself. I have to try Pepper X!
Historians are gonna look back at the late teens, early twenties of the twenty-first century and wonder why the letter ‘X’ gained so much popularity and earned so much animosity 😅
That was just so funny, poor poor Klaus 🤯
I was just thinking Chili Klaus should come back to hot ones yesterday?!?!
Ed was so cute when the feeling came after receiving the Guiness plate
Please name the new sauce I’m In Heat !  Claus earned it.
I met Klaus once in Copenhagen at an event he was doing, he was coming out with these ghost chili sausages and I got to try one, and I saw Klaus was there and I wanted to say hi, and honestly, he was one of the nicest people I have ever met. I feel like at the time, he was kinda big here in Denmark, and I was worried when I met him he was just doing it for his 15 minutes, but boy was I wrong. I like spicy food myself, and I did a chili tasting like he does with a friend and I told Klaus about it, and he told me about some of his stories also. While we were chatting a crew from a TV station came up to him and asked him for an interview, he told them. "Not now, can't you see I am talking with my chili colleague here". And then we chatted a bit more, and he asked me about my opinion of the sausage, and then asked if I wanted one more with him, so we ate one, took a picture together after. I can really say he does it because he has huge passion for it, and he seems to really love to engage with his fans, the fame seems secondary to him. I do hope one day I cross path with him again :) Super wholesome guy.
:D
congrats
Prepare yourselves Rhett and Link
Great to see everyone together!
So hot Chili Klaus forgot how to speak English, an achievement indeed!
I feel like they might rerelease the skin soon. With these events they usually drop new skins at the store
NOPE
for some reason I was trying not to touch my eyes while watching this 😆
So good to see Klaus again 😂 ❤
Hehehe, next time Sean hangs out with Klaus, wear a wig identical to chili Klaus...
Seeing Ed get choked up with his Guinness Record was incredible!
The "why" after Klaus asked if he made the pepper was sad and hilarious <3 haha
Love this wholesome content!
It takes a special kind of people to devote themselves to relieve a world record. Ed is a real guy.
I mean, Sean really should have eaten a whole pepper. Maybe the lawyers didn’t let him! To be host of Hot Ones, you gotta jump in head first!
Chili Claus: "I... I am... In heat"   That is the h0rniest thing I have ever heard on First We Feast!
I want to see a proper 10 pepper sit-down with these guys one by one.
Ed's eats pepper x with no reaction  while Klaus and Sean are falling apart.
Congrats Ed! You rule.
Pity Sean chickened out
Love Chili Klaus disappointed Sean didn't get fully involved but i dont blame him. also that scale is logarithmic so its more like.....
Klaus and Sean are a hilarious duo 😂😂😂 love em. Well done to Ed and team!
My grandma was laughing crazily when she saw the episode of Carolina reaper in 2016, she passed away in 2021, she can't watch this episode now. I got emotional when I saw this episode 💔  May God grant her heaven 💔
Love these guys. Middle class all the way
I love you beautiful messed up people! Congratulations Ed (and team), so happy to see you recognised and validated for your years of dedication and effort.
The best parts was when Chili Klaus Say to Ed "Did you do that?  Did you invent that pepper?"  Ed says "yes" and Klaus says "why"  Hysterical!
Sean turned into Stevie from Malcom in the Middle after eating it! XD
History in the making!
Ed Currie was was obviously designed to be the one to develop these chilis!
Sean has such a warming presence. I'd be so happy to have him as a friend in my life.
Chilli klaus just made me laugh for a good 10 minutes straight😂
Yes.
Vy? Vy deed you invent that peppa?
The science geek in me would love to see a video where someone eats Pepper X and then gets a brain scan - it seems like there's so much happening in the body when one of these is consumed!! Lets do it for science!!
this is the greatest hot sauce I've ever had, definitely will be a repeat customer on the last dab Xperience, featuring pepper x
High as  🦒… ⛽️
wow honestly this was way more educational than i expected, i appreciate that man thx!
That must be so hot 😂
Im in heat 🤦🤣 Did you really invent that pepperr? yes. Why?! 😭😭😭
Would of loved to see Sean go full pepper with Klaus. But yeah, amazing video, amazing people, keep it up
We need the extended edition with Chili Klaus’ reaction!
Skud ud til Klaus 🇩🇰🇩🇰🇩🇰😂😂😂
love how everyone is in pain exept Ed  :)
Absolute legend. Congrats. When can we get our hands on some seeds? :D Much love from Australia.
I've missed chilly klaus ❤
Chilli  Klaussssss❤
Congratulations!!
Chili llama the legend is back
Awesome all around! I’m sure it’s been suggested before, but Hot Ones needs to get involved in the hot potato chips market! Can you imagine the success?! This was a feast for the teary eyes. 🥲
Ed is like the fighter pilot who talks normal while pulling 8gs at 9:21 on a Tuesday morning
...spices making my eyes water up to y'all..
Carolina Reapers have been a favorite of mine for a few years now, so I'd love to get my hands on Pepper X.  Make some hole in the bowl chili lol
Firstly, congratulations 🎊 🍻 incredibly deserved. Secondly, thank you 🙌🤌  Edit: Holy f*** that pepper looks like a grenade from Oddworld 😂 I want one
It's nice to see Sean in pain. LoL
THIS WAS GREAT!!! I LOVE U SEAN
Dude Ed actually has really good comedic timing
I loved the "I'm on the edge of my seat" line delivered with the aforementioned pulled back face.
Congrats- the naming of pepper X reminds me of my profession, X-rays… they didn’t know what it was so per algebra, the unknown is ‘x’
puts os caras comem pimenta mesmo e Mr. Ed. Currie não faz nem careta .... parabéns Ed. Currie, pelo lindo trofel do Guinness World Record .... parabéns a todos ... top de mais da conta SÔ ....
is Smokin' Ed Currie  in good health ? keep seeing that he's hand's are shakeing to much
Pretty sure Johnny schovile ate a pepper x ...
Just wow! Congrats Ed and everyone involved!
I have to say to be able to watch this in my lifetime as a Gen Xer is completely epic.  Congratulations on your success.  Well earned and deserved!
if only guinness tried just a thin slice...
Ed is like a modern day George Washington Carver
Praise jeebus
THE GOAT RETURNS! CHILI KLAUS THATS MY KING!!!
Ed Currie isn't human
The world needs this
The power of pepper X is legit.  It made a man cry over a pepper before he even took a bite.
These guys unilaterally declared war on toilets
Gladiators of spice lets go!!
what a marketing explosion. lol
I felt myself go into a cold sweat when they started eating those peppers.
These three are 3 royally different people that were totally made for eachother lol
This was like a feature length film in under 15 minutes. The build up, the emotion, the comedy, it was all there.   I really wanna see more of the aftermath from this.
We are proud of you chili Claus 😃🇩🇰 Vi er stolte af dig chili Claus 😃💪🏼
I've been waiting for this reunion for the longest
Anyone else get hyped seeing Chili Klaus?? It’s been too long
For a moment I thought Clouse was gonna die lol
The Reaper is an amazing plants, beautiful, great tasting pods with a special, very unique heat. I can't wait to get my hand on some of Eds new award winning genetics! Much love and respect to the entire team!!!
Spicy food is the best mind altering thing on the planet.
Aw ed :')
Great segment and congratulations, Ed, and your whole team
So happy to see Chili Klaus back!!
chili klaus flying halfway around the world just for some pain hahahah what a life
Medium Buffalo sauce is my limit when it comes to spice tolerance. I would probably die if I ate this stuff.
What a legendary episode
The goats of the show right here
Chilli klaus had me dying
dog straight up chuckled and said he likes it when his hotsauce puts the fear in them.
I can’t wait to purchase dried Pepper X when it becomes available in the future. I’m already starting to get used to dried Carolina Reaper peppers and they are amazing. I love the tropical fruit taste of Carolina Reaper peppers before the heat builds up. I live in Russia and I’ve been following this YouTube channel for about five years or so and I hope that someday Pepper X will be somehow shipped into Russia until then I’ll be waiting patiently. I really enjoyed the interview with Gordon Ramsey (I love how he brought gadgets with him like doughnuts and lemon annd lime juice as well as some sweet fruit beverage and at one point he put lime right across his tongue and then touched his bottom with lime) and Florence Pugh. Florence Pugh is passionate about spicy foods.
Legends in the building! Oh boy! Spice Lords!
Klaus has become a true handsome silver fox 😻
Plant: "I have a robust defense against predators eating my fruit".  Humans: "Hahaha"
Finally a episode for the chiliheads
After eating The Last Dab Xperience it felt like it kicked me into another dimension. Congrats to Smokin' Ed Currie though he made this happen!
Carolina Realer has been dethroned?!?!
LOVE THESE VIDEOS PLEASE MAKE MORE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Sean, I totally respect your decision to not eat the chilli (smart), but I can't say I'm not a bit disappointed.
The plaque hit Ed harder than the pepper should probably get a scoville reading on that
All I can say is congratulations Ed and Oh my God!!!!!😰
"Im in heat" 🤣What a truly great episode. Keep it coming guys.
So new challenge material... let's hope it doesn't claim too many lives - that seems like a weapon 😵🥵🥺
Just harvested my Carolina Reapers to use for a mead based hot sauce. I hope it doesn’t hit me like the Apollo Sauce. Ed is  correct 100%, I was scared after I dropped a wing in the dish forgot what I was doing and ate it completely coated in the Apollo sauce.
Hoping Ed has contacted the Seed Savers, and is putting seeds in the vault(s) for future preservation.
I can't believe I'm cheering for a hot sauce world record but it goes to show great a show Sean Evans and team produce.  Another epic episode in the books.
This was so wholesome :) Congrats to Ed and whole Pepper X team. And of course to Klaus and Sean for conquering another mountain of heat.
As a fellow dane. As chili claus asked "why" i really felt it. Known this guy for ages now. Way before first we feast. It's no joke.
I'm crying 😭.
About time Sean ❤
"I'm in heat!" LMAF
The Avengers of spice
CHILI KLAUS IS THE GIFT THAT KEEPS ON GIVING
I liked Ed's explanation of the Scoville scale, "if you eat three Reapers it's not 5 million Scoville, it's not additive" (paraphrasing).   So if you eat half a Reaper it's 1.6M if you take the tiniest of nibbles it's 1.6M.  So the system is based on the "power" of the fruit in a general sense,  and the total SHU drops as the pepper is more diluted in other stuff, so a fresh pepper is inherently less SHU than a dried one simply due to the water content in it.    But however it works it is not a realm I ever wish to delve,  jalapeno peppers tend to be too much for me 🤣🤣  and those are way down that list of hot things near the bottom.
As they discovered near the end, laughter is often an understated remedy for helping overcome ridiculous heat. I've eaten a reaper, and I can say: Don't go it alone. Eat the painfully spicy s**t with your friends.
I don't  get fruity from Carolina Reaper but there is a sweetness. Apollo taste way to much like what potpourri smells like and so I can't get behind it. I haven't tried pepper x to get an idea of what it comes off like
This was the episode we all wanted and have been waiting for, the hot ones dream team all together!
we need the whole session..the hours of rebirth
I miss the Hot Ones days of Coolio and DJ Khalid.  Great to have another two older faces in Klaus and Ed making a return to this channel 🤘🤘
Ed seems like such a sweetheart
I have missed Chilli Cluas . Thanks for bringing him back. And   Ed and Sean are the  godfathers of the American pepper love affair
Ed's a mad man.
Love it😂 😂😂😂😂
So is this the same pepper they've been using in The Last Dab for a few years?
Wow that looks HOT! And remember as Ed Currie said: Chili Klaus is the only person in the world to eat an whole Pepper X besides himself, Sean and Heatonist "only" ate small pieces, so even more respect to Chili Klaus. 🙏  - and a HUGE congratulations to Ed Currie for the new Guinness World Record! 👏👏👏  I have had the privilege to meet Chili Klaus in person a couple of times, and I can tell you he's exactly the same person in private as you see in the videos, nothing fake about him, he's a genuinely nice and down to earth guy.
11:38
Love Klaus. I've seen him for years here in Denmark :)  Also love the show First We Feast <3
Klaus is my hero. Such a great showman. When Ed just stands there.  These humans are legendary for this moment
Theres some oak and......pencil.
Im in ...heat. 😁🤣
Ed showed more emotion talking about the pepper than eating it.
ed trying to cure cancer with peppers and by gosh he just might
ty for tiktok upload, i am here now!
ed is a true madman hahahaha
That was definitely the most broken I've seen Chili Klaus. It is absolutely insane that Ed basically had no reaction to it.
Gastroenterologists everywhere will continue to have a job thanks to people willing to obliterate their gastric mucosa with this type of eating. 😂
I hope they didn't feed Chili Klaus after Midnight and definitely don't get him wet. Otherwise he'll breed.
Ed barely breaking a sweat and calmly analyzing the flavor and heat is the best part of this
To see the owners eat them and not break a sweat is insane!😂
oh wow, I thought you couldn't go hotter than carolina reaper, but this guy has an arsenal hidden from the world to experience whenever he feels like releasing it! hahaha awesome!
You guys are like the Avengers fo the spice world!
More Ed Currie he’s dope!
Ed must have a tongue and throat like a dragon haha... I watched him in person eat a reaper like it was nothing while one of the guys I work with ate one and thought he was going to die, coworker upchucked it about a half hour later. Ed is a fantastic guy.
Lava is hotter 😂
A very long time coming. Well deserved Ed!! Also, what a gangster just cruising while everybody is dying😂😂😂
Klaus ,where's the finger snapping at?
Make a 🌶 instead of getting 🔥it's cold
if your a hot sauce person his products are excellent. Started growing perrers because of this man
@5:00 i think da bomb should be re-evaluated with the new system. its definitely hotter than its scoville scale says it is.
Smokin' Hot Ed Currie.  Man is a legend.
World's hottest pepper 🌶️ oiiii i would try them!
❤
Blessed Love Family ❣️Put sweat on my forehead just watching. I need to start with Pepper O😂😅
Wow the Reaper has been dethroned 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Man did I miss Chili Klaus! Love that guy.
I'm so glad I got to experience this, .......so cool,.....!!!!
I'm in.....heat.   -Chili Klaus  Klaus is breeding. -Smokin' Hot Ed Currie
“I am Klaus” 😂
i would like this 1000x just because of Chili Klaus!
"did you invent that pepper?"   - Yes-  "Hwhy?"             lol
Good luck guys.
And there it is.  The snaps from Chili Klaus.
chili is hilarious 😂
Bro was dead serious about those lawyers😂
It starts at 10:30. Lets be honest... we came here to see one thing, and one thing only...
That was intense to just watch
You have broken Chili Claus. Don't do it! 😅
Poor Sean 😂
@guga you're next
Anybody who’s been watching since the beginning are prolly super hyped when they finally saw Chili Klaus in the thumbnail
Seeing Ed almost tear up made me almost tear up such a well deserved record congrats to Ed and team.
I wondered how long it would take Klaus to start snapping.......   lol
Next one should be the (wh)Y-Chili-Pepper, but just make it 5m+ - because why not :S
Watching Ed’s growth over the years to finally achieving this lifelong goal is absolutely amazing, I’m so happy for him
I could never.  LOL.  Kudos to you guys!
"Di- did you invent that pepper?" "Yeah?" "ʷ - 𝕙 𝕪 ? " dying of laughter, I feel ya
Anyone else think bearded guy was Nick Offerman from the screen grab?
Guinness world records are so fake, you could litterally give them a call and say that you achieved something and they send you the award with the frame if you pay them enough. But I‘m glad for the people who get joy out of the awards :) Congrats to you guys for Pepper X
I love how various YouTube channels have realized we should really just let Ed Currie talk and nerd out about peppers because his passion and experience bleed through even the mildest comments and expressions
I’m with Klaus “WHY”. You all are straight up crazy bonkers insane. Congrats on the new world record Ed. I don’t know how any of you still have the lining of your stomach or tongue taste buds. ❤❤❤. I love the name of your place Pucker Butte.
a scientist an artist and a true son of the land put in one person.
Congratulations to Ed and his team! Keep it up!
hmm.. i dunno.. i'm not sure they all ate the worlds hottest pepper. i know i've seen Sean eyes much, much redder from less scoville. it did seem a bit too easy ...?? no sweating or anything.  They all should take a pulse reading after 60 seconds after consuming and forehead temp reading too. that would convince me.
2+mil, It's a weapon, not just something to eat.  Congrats .
I AM JUST DYING AT THE LENGTHS THAT GROWN MEN WILL GO TO LMFAOCTFU
Chile Klaus has reached his final form.
The commentary by Ed describing the effects is just GOLD!!!
Why not eat the whole pepper, Sean? I was expecting to see you and Chili both pop one! SHAME! 🤣
SteveO?
My god. How Ed can speak while everyone is literally dying. Next level
WHY DIDN'T ANDY GLASS EAT ONE WHHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Brilliant, as always...😂
The hot ones we all needed😊🎉
I have never seen Chili Klaus not be able to speak really this was amazing and congrats on the world record
Ed looks like the snow plow driver from the movie Snow Day from when i was a kid
That looked scorching
the world needs more Chili Klaus
Please tell me you also have paramedics on set just in case
So wild ! !  I spent my life enjoying spicy food.  About five years ago I was told about a show centered around hot sauce so I found it and was almost immediately humbled.  The second wing eaten was sauced with my go to choice Sriracha, which I use sparingly.  I had no idea that hot sauce was made so much hotter and that I was such a wussy. If I was on Hot Ones I wouldn't last past the 4th wing.  Much respect to all involved with the show.  Ed, you're one of a kind and a fantastic person.  Is something hotter than X in the works ?
They do such a great job explaining the history and the making of the sauce! It’s so much better than “here is some hot stuff”
I’ve been waiting for these legends to reunite !
why is it so funny seeing people in pain from peppers lol
A very awesome chili Klaus episode
Everyone else: Dying Ed: I could go for seconds
sean, how could you not join chili klaus after already suffering with him twice!?
I couldn’t click this video fast enough!  Congratulations Ed and Puckerbutt Team! 🌶️
Love this! I'm DYING to see Sofia Vergara doing Hot Ones!! 🔥
Inspiring.
I will note that while it is groundbreaking for Ed to have the hottest pepper in the world, it's been debunked that Guinness World Records actually tackles the best or longest or strongest of anything. They give guiness records to anyone willing to pay to register for a new record.
He  said it's all about the flavour, so what about Da Bomb?
Congratulations man, keep doing what you love
2.7 million scovil - boooom!🤯 - may I never ever eat one of these.  Amen.  with ❣️ from Montana
These guys are all so endearing! As a fellow Dane, it's pretty epic seeing how appreciated chili Klaus is on Hot Ones.
You know its hot when Chili taps out!!  Congrats Ed!!!
The actual spice boys 😮😮😮😮
This is terrifying
10:09 Chili Klaus knows...
OH NO, KLAUS IS IN HEAT, WE ARE DOOMED
Wow, Chili Klaus the first one to eat the pepper who isn't named Smokin Ed.  All of them super high. That was awesome.
Congratulations Ed, It looks like it’s Smoking!!!
That's really touching. Great to see someone recognized for their hard work. Congrats!!
Elite Spice Lords
Did that dude on the right eat a stem? I wonder why...
I'm in heat 😂😂😂
I’ve been laughing for 20 minutes…”I’m in HEAT!!”😂🤣😂
Chili Klaus effin rules
This is why we come here - year after year. Chili Klaus is finally back, and this time - he's in heat.  I swear to God, that man never disappoints.
Sean ate as much of the pepper as jeff goldblum ate of the wings 🤔
"hej" :P
Yessss chili klaus is back!!
We need more Kluas
No way bro just chilling eating that pepper 💀🤣
I feel like this video needs to be sponsored by some kind of wet wipes company .... the pain oh God the pain...
When Klaus sais that he's in heat and Ed's response that he is breeding. The camera is shaking. Im sure its because camera guy Bill was laughing hard. I was in tears watching this
The way he cares enough to break down over his cultivation of peppers is so endearing.   It doesn't matter what's important to other people, it's about what is important to you.
The genuine disgruntled reaction by Ed and the price of lawyer fees is hilarious
Congratulations! Couldn't be happier about his wholesome reaction either. <3
Did Ed say the heat lasts two hours??
Dude Ed is just a machine for eating that and not even flinching
LETS GO ED!!!!
From what I've heard, Smokin' Ed came into possession of the Reaper through not so honest means himself.
The Scoville scale is linear, not logarithmic.
Gongrats! I love Chili Klaus
Chili Klaus is back ! woooh :-D
I didn’t want the video to end. All 4 of these guys are great!
The Captains of Capsaicin
Soo cool, really love seeing Chilli Claus again. More of him on the show.
That looks horrible.
This will be the zombie test in the future. Four guys eat a pepper, three guys squirm. You're done, Mr. #4!
I live in Rock Hill, SC, which is just 10 minutes from where Ed has his shop. I've been in there a few times and it's a pepper lover's paradise.
Well needed
🇩🇰🇩🇰🇩🇰
That's the second time Ed made me cry. 😅. This was fantastic.  🫡
You guys are crazy,lol!
Congratualations Mr. Curry. Thank you for your contribution and hard work!
*Finally...ive already mastered Carolina Reaper*
I'm terrified of what ed makes next.
I want to see Sasha Banks eat this and then say with zero emotion or zeal, "oh sure this is spicey"
I'm in heat!  LOL
Oh no, Clause is breeding!
Congrats Ed you're in the books now
Watching Ed almost cry at the award was so beautiful ❤ I'm so used to watching him laugh like a madman in videos when people talk about spicy creations... but watching his heart well with pride and almost cry was amazing. Good for Ed and his team ❤
I hope Chili is okay! Worried about him…
WWWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Thank you for getting Klaus on there, it made it.
BEING PASSIONATE IS SO AWEWSOME...LOVING WHAT YOU DO AND DOING IT!!!!
I accidentally mixed up some Reaper with Scotch Bonnets and ended up with a whole one in a salad. That was insane! I can't begin to imagine what Pepper X would be like.
Crazy. I like spicy food but not borderline torture 😂
I think klaus has mail
If Gordon Ramsey was on this panel, he would break the show's profanity record several times over.
Beware the Arthur Slugworth's of the world.
Na man seeing Klaus struggle so much makes me want to try it and never go near it ever at the same time!!
🌶️🫑💕
Congrats guys!!!! Love the content
I need one of these. Ate Ed's Chocolate Bhutlah (on my channel) a few years ago and countless reapers. I'M READY ED.
Awesome
Smokin Ed is def my kinda dude, would love to eat some shrooms with that  guy fr
Not trying to be mean but what's up with Ed's teeth? Almost looks like his mouth is bleeding are something
Congratulations Smokin' Ed! I remember meeting him at a restaurant in Rock Hill, SC. I don't usually approach people, especially at restaurants but I couldn't help it and to my surprise, he got up treated me so nicely and had a few minutes of conversation with me. He's a very deserving man!
Pepper X looks like an Elden Ring boss.
PEPPER CULT
I would kick a baby for these seeds! I'd feel bad about doing it, but I would!
Will they ever sell Pepper X and Apollo seeds?
Hot Ones has really taken off. Uploaded 2 hours ago and it's already got 200k views and over 1000 comments. Congrats to Smokin Ed!
Imagine how bad it's going to burn coming out...
The Unholy Pepper Trinity
Ed is a master at his craft. I love how he describes what everyone is feeling.
Oh please do a new hot ones episode with chilli klaus!!!! ❤
Chili Klaus! 🎉
Way to go Ed! Congratulations for cheating THE new hottest pepper in existance. 👏
YES! Congratulations Ed Currie and All at PB Pepper Company, A new Guinness world record for worlds hottest pepper is insane, well done to you guys! My question is, now that it's official, are we going to actually going to be able to grow Pepper X for ourselves now? Is Ed going to release some seeds for people to start growing it?
When will the pepper x seeds be available for purchase on his website?
Smokin Ed is a madman! 🤯 absolute legend!
Awesome
Chili Klaus is back!!
Everyone is writhing in pain while Ed is just through some facts about Pepper X.
Ed:… and we’ve just been waiting to take it out, but no one’s been able to take us out… Also Ed: people have been trying to steal (my pepper) for the last ten years… 😂
Do I look like Taylor Swift🤣
This was such a wholesome and incredible moment I'm so happy for you Ed you and your team deserve all of the success in the world. Side note, when do the hot ones hot pockets come out!??
Crazy to see how much of a science goes into making these hot sauces.  Much respect!
God you just gotta love Klaus! I'm in heat! 😂
Chili Klaus is such a badass
I dont know you, even i'm proud that you made it to the guinness book of records. Watching from Rotorua, my hometown of new zealand. Oh i'm glad i'm not the one eating that. 😊
And to think, evolution thought that this was the way to NOT eat this plant.....gotcha that time universe! Ha! Never underestimate the human spirit!
You almost killed chili klaus
happy for ed , congratz
Chili Klaus is the best 🤘🏽🤘🏽🤘🏽
That was a weak performance by Sean not to est a whole pepper an take a sliver....I'm upset
Did you invent that pepper ? Yes ! Why 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
If chili klaus couldn’t handle it .. I’m staying away 😳
The day has come....epic
Fedt haha, congrats
😮well done
That needs to go on the bottle.  "I'm in heat!" --Chili Klaus, 2023
😂😂I can't wait for YouTubers to make this a challenge 😆🙌❤️💯
I demand a behind the scenes!😀
And Ed just stands back with his arms crossed looking like, what’s so bad about it! At the end Ed is pealing a banana, is that a secret to stopping the burn?
Ed's taste buds should write a memoir 😅
Love you guys
I like how it’s called “Pepper X” like it’s a Bioweapon
Is it the same guy that presents awards for guiness???
Seeing someone have their efforts validated will always be wonderful. Kudos to everyone who made this happen.
This was LONG overdue!
They feel flavor?
well done Ed and the team
😱😱🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯 You guys should Name it "THE DEVIL'S FRUIT 😈⚡" The spikes make me shiver 😖🔥💯
I’m in heat 😂😂
Love Chili Klaus! And the snaps haha
😂 Chilli Klaus and Sean Evans love  when they eat peppers together
klaus:did you invent that pepper  ed: Yes Klaus: Why 😂😂😂😂  what a legend and congrats to ed and his team for the Guinness book of record fantastic 👌
Cant wait for the year 2050 🤣🔥🤣
Some men run marathons... other men climb Everest... Some men set out to go to space... Others set their sites on the moon itself... And then there are these men... Men who throw caution to the wind and truly discover the limits of the human body. 🤣
Ed is a beast
Amazing video
I dont know if folks realize when Chili Klaus has issues with a pepper, thats a hot pepper. Ed's nuts. He shares pics of the peppers he tries daily on fb but Klaus having problems like that. Thats too hot of a pepper.
guinness world records? ... ugh
Sean’s sweater is so dope!!
I dont know who this guy is, but this guy chili klaus just came here to die i guess
An't Reaper X hotter than the Pepper X and what about the Primotalii
Heck yeah Ed!
They just mentioned Taylor swift. Is this a hint?!?!
I saw Chilli Klaus and I got excited
That was the best episode in awhile 😂
🎉🎉🎉 Congratulations Smokin Ed on the new worlds hottest pepper 🎉🎉🎉
I hope they paid Chili Klaus well!  If it did that to him, I'd just go into a coma
Would love to have Taylor Swift on the show! She deserves to be interviewed with Sean's great questions and not with those who always asks her about her love life... I also want to see her beat those wings like the queen she is! and maybe suffer a lil bit too haha
Im not crying, you are!
HAHAHA 10:38 and beyond is PURE COMEDY.  You have, arguably, the number 1 chili aficionado in the world DYING, and all he can manage to say is, "s very spicey."  HAHAHAHA I laughed so hard that I woke my children in the other room.  "I love the flavor (continues to die), I think there's some oak in it (starts to die way harder and probably hallucinate),  and PENCIL."  HILARIOUS.  Thank you for that Klaus.  I hope you feel better.  You made my evening.
Wow, what an incredibly sweet sweet and so well spoken human.
They better have paid sean 7 figures to eat that pepper
It even looks evil……..
Isn’t dragons breath hotter?
Exciting news, dude who made the Carolina reaper dethrones his own pepper with an even hotter one.
13:53 😂
I cant believe ed broke Klaus.  Never thought i would see that happen.  Lol
I mean yeah congrats, but it doesn't mean a whole lot if no one else can get their hands on the pepper, sauces will never capture the heat of a fresh pepper. I wish he would release pods and seeds already. Like we get it, you did it, now let us try it.
Looks quite hot.
So like ... when can people get some seeds to grow their own? I wanna try this out, seems like fun! Are those on sale? Will they be?
I'm in heat 😂😂😂
IM IN HEAT
i felt the air snaps lol dont know why it happens but i get the same reaction
ITS KLAUS!!
masochistic
Innnnnnnnsanity!
❤
He was genuinely emotional when he got the world record! Well deserved
Yayyy! The reaper drama is over! Cant say that you stole this one 😉
Where’s David Blaine ready to chomp this down like a boss
Came to watch a video of some dudes eating some peppers, instead got tears in my eyes multiple times and a rare insight into this beautifully wholesome world of peppers. Such a beautiful video. I really got the sense that every single guy standing there is an absolutely top class human - humble, kind, genuine and authentic.
Wow.... seeing these guys panic is crazy
Congratulations to Smoking Ed! That episode was amazing like always. ❤
"I'm in heat" 😂
well done! a truly great American craftsman
This guy eating the world's hottest pepper and barely reacting to it that's wild
Sean's as hot as the pepper.
"Did you invent that pepper?" "Yea" "Why?"
Hope Klaus made it home okay...
3:00 bold words from someone who did exactly that.
Congrats Ed!
I love how passionate he is about his craft
Ed is literally the living example of every mad scientist in existence
Ed is a legend
Poor Klaus
Sean's visible dread as the peppers came in was amazing. 😂
Anytime you see Ed in a thumbnail, you know it’s going to be good
This video was pure joy! Chili Klaus is such an eclectic character!!
Noah handled it pretty well
Love Chili Klaus 👏🔥
2.6m. …… jesus
Ed is a freaking Beast!
These peppers should be used during the Navy SEAL application process.
"i love..the flavour" 😵‍💫
NOPE, NOPE, NOPE:)
Ok sight me up, where that sauce at ?
Im surprised with the amount of money dude makes on peppers he hasn’t spent some money on a new set of teeth. 🤢
You got world records, best friends, wholesome interactions and people blissfully in pain.  What more could you ask for with quality entertainment?!
Smokin Ed is the nicest guy ever.
I love Ed Currie's enthusiasm.
Amazing 😂❤
Why Smokin’ Ed Currie kinda shaped like a pepper? 😭😭
Chilly Klaus just bailing like 'I'm done, I'm out!' is the funniest piece of internet lately. 🤣🤣🤣
Poor Klaus.
Ed is an animal! Congrats! Tip of the cap to Klaus for powering through
Ed is like Sauron who crafted the one ring and Sean carries that power now but never wanted it.
Its not logarithmic
Now that it's official, will we ever get normal sized bottles of the Last Dab with Pepper X?
I'm in heeaaaat.   I'm dead.
Congrats Smokin' Ed!!! Now that it's been certified, do you plan to rename it?
Ed could do a mean ben stein imitation
Still calling bs... I don't trust Ed Currie
You know it's hot when Sean is wincing.
I met Ed at WPIX a number of years ago. He was showcasing the reaper pepper, and had some sauces on set. When i met him backstage, he pulled a up bottle of pureed reaper from his waistband. I said, "oh man...Are you keeping that bottle in your jockies? GIMME A CHIP!" lol. Holy moly was that hot. and It was only a dab
What a FANTASTIC lineup! You couldn't have had more suitable people present for the unveiling of the diploma.
Such a nice thing you guys did for Ed!  Had me tearing up 😅
Wish this episode was longer. Sean you should do a hot ones episode with smoking Ed. Would love to learn all about him and wash him crush the wings
I want to see David Blaine eat this he didnt need a sip of water after the wing challenge and ate Carolina reaper
Always. ALWAYS such a treat when I see Chili Klaus. I always go back to their old videos together with Shawn
My son and I did Smokin' Ed's "The Duel" chip challenge with the Pepper X and It is really No joke!  That thing is HOT!
Imagine what Ed could do with some cannabis....the strains he'd create
I think  I speak for the rest of the Hot Ones Community. WE LOVE CHILI KLAUS!!!!
Please send me one bro 😂
Knew whenever Chili Klaus came back it'd be insane. 😂
Oh NOO he’s Breeding 😂🤣☠️
"Do I look like Taylor Swift?"   As long as you dont act like her its fine lol she's freaking nutz, she lost her mind.
I'm in HEAT ~ Chili Klaus
Why?
Congratulations Ed!! It’s always good to see Chili Klause as well 🙏🏼
I love ‘Chili Klaus’!🤘
Would need a really big number toeven think about  eating one of those.
He looked just like Taylor Swift
I’m still eager to meet Chili Klaus’ hot Scandinavian cousins! {;
I love these people so much
"Congratulations, you're officially amazing." SO heartwarming. Literally.
🎉🎉🎉🎉woohoo ed! And 2 thumbs up for putting that in yalls singing holes😂😮😂!!
Congrats Ed and team!!
The trembling "why?" killed me. 😂  Good vibes all around, but I'll never ever let that doomsday berry on my plate. 😅
Congrats!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is awesome. I started my pepper breeding project after 10 years experience in growing them. Wish I started earlier! Not going for the hottest. I crossed a Bishops Crown with a Lemon Drop. Cant wait for next growing season!
Unrelated- only english Québécois over the age of 40 will think ‘pepper x’, has to mean ‘french twitter’😉😂
I love these episodes but also fear for you guys. Fellas! No need to go so extreme. Protect your health (mental / physical)
I've watched Ed loosely on his journey to create this pepper, seeing his dreams realized on this platform is an absolutely beautiful moment. Congratulations on your lifes work Mr.Currie you said you'd do it, people tried to stop you for nearly 10 years, and now you can reap the rewards. well done
You gotta love a chili Klaus episode
The Tsar Bomb of peppers. Loved this video!
I love how wholesome Ed's love for peppers is.
Am I the only one a little disappointed he didn't eat the full pepper with Klause
Chili Klaus  :)
Did they get permission from Elon Musk to use that name? lol
How could you do this to chilli Klaus?😢
Claus: Did you invent that pepper? Ed : yeah Claus: why!!!??
Yall made me sweat... wow❤
Once we bought a varolina reaper for our friend who likes really really really spicy food, tho were not sure but we swore that he had a schizophrenia for like 20 minutes... After seeing this video together, the devil is whisperingnto us to buy pepper X to see what will this do to our dear friend who we love him so much 😂😂😂😂
8:50 Mount Rushmore moment!! Chili Klaus, Sean Evans, Ed Currie, Noah Chaimberg! 😭🌶️🌶️🔥 If I'm crying it's from the peppers, I promise!! 😊❤️
Mans teeth where chocolate brown 😮😂 💩
Ed is a true pepper jedi. He ate that pepper like he was its loving master then level headedly explained to us the sensation. Everyone else was DYING
I think it’s finally time to take that TBA off of the last dab. Because it obviously is not hot enough. so let’s go hot ones take the TBA off of last dab hot sauce. Let’s call today.
That ended way too fast
7:10 there’s nothing more beautiful than just seeing someone’s passion shine through
Awe, him tearing up broke me a little, not gonna lie haha
Sean you should’ve ate a big one like Klause did not just a sliver 👎 c’mon man
CHILI KLAUS IS BACK!!!
Been waiting for this seqeul!
Holy jeez, the pepper x looks so EVIL HAHAHAHA
OH HOW I’VE MISSED CHILI KLAUS
just love Klaus at the end. "did you invent the pebber? why?"
I APPLAUDED.  Congratulations, Ed and team!!!!!!!
Wow chili Klaus was in serious pain
It looked like Seans face just went completely numb
ed is such a good guy! all of his sauces he makes flew right out of the bottle for me.  a good hot sauce is like a good wine. im glad its made it to this level where everyone can experience sauces and flavors of this caliber. thanks to all of you and what you do!
Congrats to the master of spice. Also I love to see Klaus again, always so much fun.
I’M IN HEAT!
I am so happy to see chili klaus again!!!!!
pepper man seems like a nice man
Yes, this is exactly what i need, Chili Klaus and Sean going at it again
Where can i get some pepper x seeds
Yay Chilli Klaus!
Rhett and link where ya at
More Chili Klaus! It's been too long 🍻🤘
I'm In Heat 🔥
Bout time. Js
Sean and Noah were wise to only taste a small sliver. Ed eats a whole pepper and is barely phased by it. 😆
ED is such a legend just standing there smirking chewing his pepper while everyone dies of the heat
Congratulations to Ed and his team.  But now I need to see people like Brian Ambs and Johnny Scoville try it out and get their opinions compared to peppers that aren’t “officially” as hot as PepperX
Isn't Chocolate Primotalii hotter?
I think you almost killed Chili Klaus lol
Always great to see Sean and Chili Klaus together (:
“Do I look just like Taylor swift” i too ask myself this 😂😂😂
Bringing back Chili Klaus to poison him one more time is a hilarious bit.
“I’m in heat” 😂😂😂😂
Awesome! What does this mean for the Apollo pepper?
This doesn’t look enjoyable at all, had a boss once that had a motto that the hotter the better.
You need to interview all the college coaches😂😊
I ate a whole habanero once and for sure thought I was in mortal danger. I can't imagine what this level of heat would be like.
Extended footage of the four after eating the pepper?
Ed's lack of reaction to the pepper is scary, but impressive.
Chili Klaus is The 🐐
LoL I comment you guys should hook up and nice
Congrats on the world record! And it's so good to see Claus again!
Ed what a legend.
CONGRATULATIONS ED! 🎉 🌶️
The return of Chili Klaus!!!!!
i wish guiness' "approval" actually meant something. i trust ed more than them
"Flavor" is a strong word in that context.
Klaus literally turned PINK!
My favourite sauce is 12 million scoville extract in it, lovely tomato, garlic and lime taste. Wiltshire Chilli Farm, Regret
3:05 Troy Primeaux has joined the chat. 3:13 Ed Curry has left the chat...
Klaus and Sean are dying and Ed is like "Eh, just another quality control test."
Has anyone checked to make sure Chili Klaus is alive still???
stop keeping guiness world record comitee around
chili Claus coming in dropping another amazing one liner then disappears until the new world record pepper shows up. "Im in heat"
the amount of pain i was in from eating diluted ghost pepper and these guys eating something so far beyond that i cannot imagine the pain
When yall started laughing I was like oh there goes the endorphine rush lol
I bet mosquitos who bite Ed burst into flames.
So proud of the 4 of you. That was no joke
It wouldn't be a Chili Klaus episode without a classic line like "I'm in heat..."
release the pepper x with surgeon's general warning
I'm in heat 💀
For Klaus to react like that you know it was hot
If Klaus is dancing like that I would be dead from that chili!
"I'm in heat!"
What's the point of eating lava?
That was a great episode. That pepper is not only the hottest pepper ever but the look of that crazy thing scares me most of all. It reminded me of some prop from the old star trek tv show. The planet of the killer peppers in the romulin galaxy. That thing even looks dangerous.
Someone get Ed to a dentist please!
what a fantastic group of people
So good!😅
Congrats to Smokin' Ed Currie n team !!
Very funny.
Chili Clause - "I'm Out. Did you invent that pepper?....Why?!!"
I didnt see Noah eat a whole pepper?? It looks like just a stem
“I’m in heat” plus Ed’s follow up of “Oh no, Klaus is breeding” had me laughing so hard. What a great video!
Sean I think maybe it's time to retire soon? I'm mainly concerned about your insides ♥️
So glad Chili Klaus is back
YES
thank you for the video
That was awesome! I need some of that sauce!
Love u guys. Especially when Klaus joins u
I can barely eat a jalapeno comfortably, so there's no way on earth that I'm trying Pepper X. I'll admire it from afar and appreciate what goes into making it.
Ah yes. Pepper X, the first of it's kind.. With notes of fresh floral citrus, oak, and pencil.    In all seriousness, congratulations Smokin Ed. You deserve it!
That chili looks angry.
Claus : Did you invent that pepper..... ED: yer........ Claus : why?......  hahahahahaha
chili klaus is such a treasure
Guys... he's in heat
I started sweating just watching their reactions
Champions each and every one of these men.
doesn’t matter how tough you are a pepper like that will break anyone down to their real selves lol
Passion is beautiful. Congratulations Ed and team.
There's a guy who loves what he does
What a cool episode congrats to Ed's team
7:51 Ed turned into bubbles for a second there 😂
Dang I felt sorry for Chili Klaus
one of the best First We Feast videos of the year
Congrats to Ed! What a moment to get that award!
Ed's chewing that pepper like its gum. What a mad lad.
Let's just ignite a road flare and eat the noisy end...
Klaus: "I'm in heat"  Everyone: ??  Klaus: "I'm in heat"
No matter what you do, what you love and what you aspire to be, treat those things like Ed does. What a great, great person.
I love how it looks like Ed just ate a jalapeno. Congrats to Ed, true icon in the world of peppers well deserved.
Nick Saban making peppers now.  Dude sounds just like Coach Saban.  LOL
Legendary!  From Ed to Sean and Chilli Klaus, you guys are amazing people!  Congrats on the new world record!  And Klaus, thanks for the new meme material! I’M IN HEAT! Hahahahahha
I couldn't stop laughing. "It tastes like it has a little bit of oak in it" and "pencil" sent me reeling. 😂😂
My hometown is Tega Cay, SC and I went to Fort Mill High School.  When I learned the Reaper was from Fort Mill it made me happy.  I’ve been by the store twice in the last few years.  Such great people.  I don’t know Ed but I was moved to tears for him today watching this.  The guy from Guinness seemed like he was on the verge of tears too!!  Way to go Ed!  I just called the store and left a message for Mike too!!  You and your team deserve it!!!
Get David Blaine back to do this with.
Will Pepper X be included in the 10 hot ones now?
"did you invent that pepper?" "Yes" "...why?"  Hahahaha
Ed aint ish 😂😂😂😂😂😂. I love it. "I'm in heat" 😂😂😂
It's tastes like oak....and pencil ✏️ 😂
This was brilliant. Congratulations to Ed and his team for this award.
I think it's fair to say that, Chili Klaus is the best looking dude in Hot Pepper culture.
why nothing about Noah??
I always love it when an individual gets credit for something that was clearly a team effort, and the whole team gets recognition.  Plus, it was genuine.  Not the whole, "I'd love to thank my team, and my mom, and most of all...God."
"Did you invent that pepper"? "Yes" ......"why" ?!?!??!?!?!!  Iv never laughed so hard in my life this was brilliant
I’m in HEAT!!!..😂😂😂
So not true. The primo is the hottest
Wow 🎉. Please give us more chili Claus!!!! Ed is hilarious but his spice tolerance is too strong!
Chilli Claus is a savage.
ed selling pepper x seeds now? going to have to grow some. ed is the man!
The primiotolli is the hottest pepper
HOW the F*** is Ed not given ANY F*** about what he just ate?!?!?! Godlike mindset! Proof of Mind > Body
Can’t believe Sean didn’t eat a whole pepper with his bro.  Then kept tryin like he was on the same level of pain 💀🤣
I love hoh sean asked what the culinary purpose was and Ed just says nah i just like to torture people
Klaus can't believe this?!?!?!?  I can't believe this!  The legend is back!
CHILLI KLAUS FINALLY !!!!!!!!!! THANKS
Chili Klaus FTW! 😂🎉
Congrats Ed!! You are smokin’!!!
Ed wakes up and rubs pepper X on his teeth and goes about his day.
Congrats to everyone involved in making Pepper X !! Thats some serious heat
Chili Klaus!!!!!!!!!
That thing could pass as a Devil Fruit from One Piece
And how do you  end up naming the peppers:  Well we sit around and get high and eat peppers and i feed the guys different stuff... AHAHAHAHAHA
When chili klaus starts the snaps, you know the pepper isn't playing around
“I’m in heat.” ☠️
Ed team up more when he got the award than eating the pepper u guys are nuts 🤣 ❤
Now the big question,,,will he sell seeds or try to keep it for himself?
Ed = nonhuman
Yes!!!! Ive been hoping for so long for another adventure with Chili Klaus!
I cant believe sean didnt eat the whole pepper with claus and ed
When this happens again, I'm not sure if you guys have a good relationship with Johnny Scollvile but I think the next time something like this happens he'd be a great person to add to this group of Pepper Heads.
Can we please check up on Klaus? ❤
This is so exciting, I honestly can't believe the pepper X really was the real deal. I was beginning to think it was exaggerated because I have done nothing but only heard about it since I got into super hot peppers about 4 years ago, but now that I have seen it be officiated as the genuine new Guinness record holder, I am actually very happy, and I am very curious if I ever get to try one, what a genuine 2.6 million shu pepper is going to feel like compared to the primotallies which at the moment have had a harsher bite to them than any other super hot pepper that I have ever had. It would be really cool in the near future if the seeds for this thing could be released, I would be so happy to get to grow these things.
This was legendary.
😵😵‍💫🥳
Legends
Were going to need to see Sean Evans eat a whole Pepper X now for science.
I just realized that Ed Currie is not only a genius but also very thankful. Well done Sir Ed! Speaking of Ed - does anyone else see that Chile Klauss looks almost exactly like Edward Van Halen? Epic!
Ive met Ed at many hot sauce events. To this day ive never asked for a celebrity photo, but always get one with Ed. Me, my 12yr and 8yr old sons all did the last dab, the kids didnt get a smaller dose either. We survived haha, i warned them, but they wanted to do it!!
As Phil Colin's once said, "I've been waiting for this moment for all my life"
So uh, did we just watch an old man die?
RIP to all the testers and reviewers of this pepper, as their anuses are probably forever and irreversibly damaged.
bless ya Ed.  doing the lords work :)
Oh you spoil us
Finally! Superb. Congrats Ed!
Could you imagine if Biden came on and did this
yeah!! :D
Klaus' look at first glance reminded me of Steveo when he had to do a stunt and said why do I have to be Steveo. Congratulations Ed on the world record
I felt that, even though it was on screen.  Congratulations on your Guinness World Record honor!!!!  And, thanks for this video!
I would like to see it go head-to-head against the chocolate primotali.
How the f*ck did Ed manage to eat that pepper and just stand there with a smile
There bums must be on fire
I WAS HERE ONE HOUR AFTER THIS WAS POSTED. MUM I MADE IT!
Never seen people so excited to  eat poison! 😃😃😃😃
Ed seems like such a genuine dude
Sean cmon now you have to eat the pepper on this tremendous occasion
Quick suggestion.. how abt… mixing da bomb and pepper x. 😂😂
The way everyone just shuts up and looks at Chili Klaus when he says, " I am heat" is so funny!! I love Chili! Such a good sport!
have you actually killed Chilli Klaus??? 🤣🤣
JFC. I need this. Right now.
I love the corp espionage drop at 3:00
Poor Chili klaus that was the funniest sentence I've ever heard "I'm in heat".
Ed is such a great guy. His story is inspiring too. He's grateful for everything he has.
I am in heat 😂😂😂😂
Chili!!!!! Love that guy!
Feel so happy! Ed's emotions! Legends!
Åh altid godt at se Chili Klaus på Hot Ones 😂
"i'm in heat" 🤣
Congrats on the Guiness World Record.
Pepper x heat lasts 3 and a half hours.
Been waiting for Pepper X to be unveiled man can't wait to see what it does to the eaters and have a good laugh!!!
Best video to date! Congrats Smokin' Ed and his team on the World Record! Sean and Klaus are definate legends! Cheers!🍻
I've been waiting for this moment. Congratulations Ed and Ed's team
Ed the goat ❤ Just eat a x and just smile on his face 😅
who is this weak punk....why not get JOHNNY SCOVILLE
Wow one of the best videos ever. First off congratulations to Ed for the record, and congrats to my chili dealer Klaus to be the second to eat a whole Pepper X 🌶️❤️
Chili Claus is in heat
Oh like you did too Troy primo haha 😂
Klaus: “Did you do that? Did you invent that pepper?” Ed: “Yeah.” Klaus: “Why?”
I LOVE seeing someone who is SO PASSIONATE about what they do. Awesome episode.
So happy to see Chili Klaus again!
Chili Klaus is a delightful man, I'm always happy to see him make an appearance, same goes for Smokin' Ed Currie, seeing him get so emotional was pretty wholesome.
They should all eat a chocolate primotalli
This is difficult to watch. I squirm after eating a jalapeno.
That "I'm in heat" soundbite will take it's place in the rafters. Incredible.
Okay. Where do I order it ?
awe this made me so proud for ed and his team. congrats
"Did you invent that pepper"  "Yes"  "Why????"  That had me rolling.
I WANT THE SEEDS. I WANTED THEM YESTERDAY I NEEEEEED IT
Ha! So glad to see Klaus back! and seeing Ed choke up from the recognition is the most wholesome thing i've seen in a while. Great show guys!
The way that Ed talks about the peppers is very similar to higher level discussions about marijuana. Were uneducated people simply focus on THC content, but educated people will focus on the cannaboids.
Gongrats Ed love from Danmark 🇩🇰😃👍
That was absolutely amazing. Three men die eating a pepper, and Ed calmly tells them he feels just like they do. 😂😂😂
I was literally checking just two weeks ago if there was a more recent video with Klaus, this is great!
i'd risk my stomach and sanity for a taste of one of those fresh peppers.... Congratulations! Ed has alweis seemed such a nice guy, he deserves it. and i'm glad he received his merits while on your show. all the best to you guys
Eats pepper X, the brain:"MY BROTHER IN CHRIST WHAT HAVE YOU DONE???"
I missed Chili Klaus. He's the best.
This was awesome! So many flashbacks. OG HeatOnes 💯
One of the best YouTube’s ever. Can’t believe you guys ate that for strangers to be entertained. That’s above and beyond the call of duty!
Congrats, Smokin' Ed & his entire team! Chili Klaus, together with Sean is my absolute favorite duo! I love it when you two get together. I wish you'd do it more often! This has got to be one of THE  BEST collaborations in food history! Bonded for life thru the love of heat! 🌶❤️‍🔥
Congrats Smokin' Ed!!!!
😮 I'm sweating on this side of the screen just thinking about it
The end.  Can you get Taylor swift on the show!!!!
Seeing Ed tear up reminds me of how genuine he really is. I remember ordering a couple things from his web store and he sent me an email. He thanked me for making a second purchase. Here years later seeing him get another world record. The man deserves it.
Whoah… that was insane.
Suggestion:  Have a Chili Klaus Christmas special episode one year.
I'm in heat! ....IM DEAD!!!! BWAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAA
Congratulations on the record! You guys are better men than me….
Chili Klaus is da man 😎
Don’t underestimate the ability to satiate other, much more expensive addictions. My  legit hero 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
"I'm in heat.. I'm in heat.." Been a long time since I've laughed this hard! Poor Chili-Klaus!
This is like the perfect episode, and I’m day 1!!!❤
Why ! 🤬 ( Joe Budden voice )
Pepper-X is a dumb name.
This guy is literally Oppenheimer of pepper making science
12:22  “I’m in. I’m in… I’m in heeeat”
I'm in heat 😂😂😂
This was wholesome. For anyone that hasn't tried it yet, yeah it is that hot haha. The sauce that is.
I started sweating 5 minutes into the video😂😂😂😅😅
Anytime I see smokin' ed currie i like the videos, he made all my favorite peppers!
Why would anyone want to eat one of them? Just asking  I'll need a gallon of ice cream until the heat goes away. But Congratulations ED!!  I wish I could be like you guys and be brave enough to try it.
Did that dude survive?
Not going to lie that was funny af. lol.
is Ed alive? I'm not sure....
dude Ed Currie is not human
Ed reminds me of David Blaine
Ed deserves it.
such a missed opportunity to give it a decent name
Why? Exactly.
So wonderful to see Chili again! We love you, Mr. Klaus!
"oh no klaus is breeding"   Can't delete that off the internet
why didn't they all eat one.... he always does with claus
Looking forward to the new GMM episode
Wowowow!
Wonder what smokin ed thinks about the kid who died from the one chip challenge.
"Did you invent that pepper?"  "Yeah." "Why?" HAHA!!! Klaus, hope you're ok. HAHA
Congrats to everyone who made that demon skittle a thing.
Yessssss!!!!!!!!!
My God …
any updates on the aftermath? aka second burn
When Ed talks about how he likes to see people scared, after eating his hot sauce was hilarious.
I'm coming for that title, old man. I want to make the hottest pepper before you die. I'm going to get some of those seeds and improve them. I just want to give you some competition. I know those genes are priceless to you, they're sacred to me.
The reunion we all needed!  Welcome back, Chili Klaus!!!!!
Congrats Smokin' Ed!
Y’all snapping fingers like the OG Klaus - best part of it. (On top of the award & reaction)
Dude loves Chilli so much his teeth have turned into tiny orange ones.
If you wanted your taste buds burned off eat this pepper.
Chili heads we gotta ride the lightning
And Chile Klaus was never heard from again...
I felt bad for Chili Klaus
Now that Guinness has done their thing, when can I get some seeds?
Rhett and Link should eat this lol
Great video.
Chili Klaus is in heat
god this episode was special.
Sweeeeeeet! Klaus and Ed!!!
'Am in Heat'...classic😂😂😂😂
I fken love these guys and this video is instant classic
Him explaining the Pepper X's effects while everybody is suffering is like a villain explaining in detail how the poison works that he just injected you with.  🤣 I can't wait for the new 1 Chip Challenge with Pepper X.
It seems Chili Klaus is slowly turning into Santa Klaus
Guinness record doesn't make it true. It bugs me every one assumes it the hottest without testing every pepper
Can we take a moment to acknowledge Sean closing the episode out like a champ after eating some of that pepper? Good job brother.
Congratulations to Ed and the team!!
Ed really really needs to get in better shape
"I'm in heat!" Oh, Klaus... never change! 🤣 Great to see you on the show again!  Congratulations on the world record Ed and may the people who try to steal your inventions get a dab of Pepper X sauce right in their eyes!
“I’m in heat” 😂 man’s turned into a dog from a pepper I’ll be okay without it
I wonder how the Chocolate Primotali holds up to pepper X
Klaus!
Ed is mad man!!!! Congrats on the title! Thank you for not killing Sean and Klaus! That just looked painful!
I really wanna try this pepper but I know how terribly that would go... Still trying to overcome Thai chilies so I'm far from being able to try this one.
CHILLI KLAUS!
If you're happy and you know it, snap your fingers.
Heh, congrats to Ed.  "I'm in heat."  There was no further required grammatical object in that sentence, he's in heat.  Made sense to me!  👍 😏
Of course, smoking Ed handles that like an absolute boss.
Why isn’t Johnny Scoville here?
Why not work on the tastiest hot pepper instead of just trying to destroy people's *ssholes?
His reaction brought a tear to my eye, this was lovely
"I'm in heat" ROFLMAO 😂😂😂
From the first sight, everything in my body keeps saying: "you need to stay away from that thing, son" Like it activated some primal instinct or somethin. That pepper looks terrifying. Congratulations Mr. Ed
Smokin' Ed didn't need this award, but you can see how passionate he is in his craft.  Well done Good Sir...that's HOT.  Pepper X deep dive rep is Chili Klaus...so great this group of gentlemen.  Fresh skin of a tangerine, and then it explodes.  Cheers. Violent pain.  What a ride...Thank you for sharing.
Its always a pleasure seeing Chili Klaus
Aye Shawn don't think since this had just made history, you have to change the design of the Scoville level, maybe the pepper size or something because the heat is going up due time?
Ed is not human
I'm in heat 😂😂😂
I didn't even eat this and I experienced dread.
I guess until someone instant dies from eating one of them, they will keep making them stronger
Ed was closer to crying when he received the plaque than when he ate the pepper haha
Pepper X... I cannot imagine how painful that one must feel... But in some way I'm compelled to try it too
Im in heattttttt Hahhahaha
Eds teeth look like pepper X peppers.
“I AM IN HEAT!” - Chili Klaus
It last for 2 hours....woaw
Imagine the fortitude required to taste pencil
Chili Klaus is hilarious.
Smokin Ed not even phased 🤣
Lol "I'm in heat"
Ed is a freakin beast. i can sort of fake it with reapers to get someone eles to eat one, saying yeah its not rally that hot but after they eat it ......
When you see Chili Klaus you know it’s going to be painful.
You'd think he could afford to get his teeth cleaned
Let's gooooooo!
Ed why do you keep inventing even more extremely hot peppers.... So I can feel something.
Good to see Chili Klaus today!
So touching!!  Well done Ed and his crew
We all love Chili Klaus ! He is such a sweet person !! It’s nice to see him with Sean again!
This is funny.  I am glad I did not do this
PLEASE have Johnny Scoville on Hot Ones and have him finish with a whole fresh Pepper X. Guaranteed he'd do it and it'd be amazing!
incredible levels of spice heat. 2.7m? what the heck. I would actually not eat that. maybe for $200000+ I might risk it
Ed's innards are the sociopaths of digestion.
Ed what a legend! I feel like I’ve just been part of a really special moment ❤ Amazing.
Incredible episode!
Ok, but was it hotter than his scandinavian cousin?
Great episoed
That is some scary $&!^ !!!
Aw, the steam team, what a group. Way to go, Ed! 🥰
This is by far the most humble of all episodes. Everyone involved is just so wholesome
The look on Seans face before diving in is hilarious. You can always tell when he's not looking forward to eating something.
bro im at the denist waiting room with tears in my eyes this is beautiful man
Brilliant news, well done Ed!!!!!
Klaus, is just so entertaining to watch... as he suffers... almost makes me feel bad 😅
In a few years, I'd love to see the Apollo Pepper have its heat level verified. I think I prefer the Apollo's flavor, it somewhat reminds me of a fatali pepper, but MUCH hotter. X still has some similarities, but like they said, a bit earthier. Overall, both are some wonderful tasting peppers.
The anxiety pepper. Good job Ed, you legend.
I thought you were gonna bring out the "spice king - @Spicyycam_"
Its honestly so so incredibly hot. started with a pea sized bit and it burnt me pretty good but went all in with seconds third helpings then a burrito with globs all in it. Completely wiped my gut bacteria out. i had hiccups out the back end it messed my up. absolutely amazing flavor for that much heat. made it the hour no drinks or anything.
The fellowship of the Pepper X
SEAN EVANS AND CHILI KLAUS!!! Never clicked on a hot ones so fast!
Chili klaus!! We missed you!
I love Claus and it is good to see him again!
Bro, what I would do to get some of those stabilized seeds 😩😩😩
Fastest click in a while. Worth it. Chili Klaus and Sean Evans are pure pure gold
2.693 million 🤯
Awesome episode.
I love Ed! what a genuinely lovely man
Reckon I could do a couple
Insane... and insanely cool.
13:50 LOLOL gREATESt mOMENT eveRRRR!!!!
Two on the left: 🥵🥵 Two on the right:☺☺
Ed is such a cool bro....  grats.
"I'm in heat" - Chili Klaus, 2023
I want la beast to eat this
Videos with Chili Klaus are the best, please bring him back soon.
Me everytime I watch a hot ones video "I could do that". Also me, eating mild hot sauce rarely.
Congrats guys.
Awesome!
So when can we get our hands on the pepper?!
“I’m in heat…!”
Disappointed Sean only ate a small slice. He can't hang with Chili Klaus anymore?
Ed is a hot pepper GOD 🔥
Hahaha
Video starts at 10:15
Oh man! Who else loves to see Sean suffer? 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Since he never really does since the beginning of Hot Ones lol
is Experience better/hotter than the Apollo last dab? I was not too impressed with the Last Dab.
“I like the way that people look when they get really scared from eating my hot sauce” whoa 🤣🤣
I was just looking for this episode yesterday.
The peppers are turning Chili Klaus grey 😂  Oh my gosh, discussing the terroir of the chili as it’s destroying them is one of the funniest things I’ve seen in a while 😅
jfc dudes I would have removed some seeds or something OUCH!
why would you do this again? 😢
I'm following the Legend, Chilli-Klaus, for years now and I never saw him like THIS! Holy cow.  Congratulatuons to the new achievment guys. Jeep it rolling
🔥
I only enjoy these endeavors for vicarious reasons! My rear-end can't even begin to contemplate the pain❤
The way he almost broke down crying when he received that plaque really tells you how dedicated Ed is to his team and the product they produce. Good on him for not just not selling out, but for buying in to himself and investing in the cultivation of strong meaningful relationships. He said it was a team effort, and I feel like he would put his whole teams names on that plaque if he could. Congratulations Smokin' Ed!
So happy for Ed and his team, he was genuinely touched.
Timing how fast the "im in heat" gets memed
Congratulations to Ed and his team for making the world record breaking hottest pepper in the world.
Does anyone actually like the little preview at the start? Like I am going to see it in 5 minutes, do you really need to spoil the reactions?
always a top tier fwf video with Chili Klaus
That pepper looks like it crawled out of a vat of toxic waste
It would have been better if they all ate a whole one.
These guys are sick and evil individuals to create such a thing.
Someone tell him what “I’m heat” means in America! 🤣❤🌶️
Definitely another potential tagline in there. "I'm in heat!" - Chili Klaus
I always look forward to seeing Chili Klaus on the show. Such a giga Chad 😂
Big congratulations to Ed and team on the amazing Guinness World Record.
Monsanto is trying to rob Ed.
aww seeing ed get emotional this is so sweet and diabolical
Oh no... Klaus is breeding!
Please sell a shirt that quote im in heat😂😂 or name a sauce or something to commemorate that funny quote
Congrats Ed!!!❤👏👏👏
Hats off to Chili Claus! Even he says "why?"
That pepper looks mean AF
It has... spikes... The pepper has spikes...
Epic stuff! 🎉😊
it's finally official. How long has Pepper X been out for....5 years now?
Awesome
Chili Klaus is an undersung hero of this show.
Nice to see Klaus again 🇩🇰😄
11:24 Every time I hang out like I love seeing you but I also don't like it yeah it's very spicy (that hit me)
Congratulations on your award, you deserved it with the love and hard work that you put into growing your peppers
Where’s all those YouTubers that do hot challenges now?? Let’s see you eat one! Lol
claus is hilarious, that end scene got me good
Wooooot!!! I cant wait to see a history chanel special now lol! Congrats Ed! Also congrats Chilli Klaus for being the 2nd in the world to eat one of those demon fruits!
I'm loving Chili Klaus in One Piece. He's a great actor.
What a wholesome video hahahaa
"I'm in heat" wonderful
Joe rogan: " it's like smoking DMT" LOL
Ed's got some serious moobs
If they're releasing this beast now, imagine what they're secretly cooking up...
As soon as I saw Chili Klaus I couldn't smash like fast enough.  He is the absolute best.
Lol poor Klaus
The guy with the glass is definitely a SUPER VILLAIN.
Ed is an amazing person, compassionate, and a legend amongst chiliheads.
💚…wait, it’s like they didn’t even eat the same peppers! 🤣
love chili klaus <3 love from a dane <3
Chili Klaus is a beast!
Super happy for Ed and the team! Always a joy to see Chilli Klaus even more so to see his reaction! 😂
That was amazing!
Where are the “Careful around Your Eyes” and “Im in Heat” t shirts 🤣🤣🤣
2:25 Oh no!!! Distallate...Sigh, I just lost my interest. All that does it cause pins and needles.
Why did Sean not eat a whole one?  I mean I can't blame him but still.
Ed is such a nice guy! I have met him a couple times at a local Italian festival that is held in Rock Hill SC every year and he's always really cool to talk to. My wife and I always stock up on the new sauces every year plus we try the hottest ones he has at the time just for some fun haha
Congratulations ed! 🫑🌶️🔥🔥🔥 officially the spice lord in the world! Lol is claus okay?
Chili Klaus looked genuinely frightened. never thought i'd see that.
This man, has dedicated his entire life, to it, he literally is so proud and he should be. I'm not a hot person. But i appreciate how, he worked so hard.
"I'm in heat" has me rollin' 😂
Eyyyy! Gutentag Mr Klaus!
The legends 💥
Ed seems like such a genuine dude.  Congrats to him and his team.
“I’m in HEAT” is a new t shirt for sale
Puckerbutt making history over here. A pepper that broke 2.69M? Nice. And the joy in Ed's voice just melts my heart.
People talking about peppers like wine and aged whiskey and cheese lol
lordy i been working on my Apollo bottle for toooo long, now there's one hotter? yaay I guess.....
Great job Ed to get yet another one!
Sean you should have taken the hit with the whole pepper with Chili Clause .
This was great. Thanks for the smiles
Klaus should be a World Heritage Protected Resource!  <3
“i’M iN hEaT”
this video gave me a stomach ache, thanks so much!!
Chili Klaus!!
That pepper looks like it woke up just hating the world.  When it woke up it's not even a choice, it always chooses violence cause it's the only option for Pepper X.
I'm in heat..... I'm in heat
Ed Currie may be the coolest man alive.   Chuck Norris has a poster of Ed Currie on his wall.
YEEESSSS HE IS BACK CHILI KLAUS
Stop upping the ante. It’s too dangerous 😭
This video is awesome. The man Ed Currie with Chili Klaus. The awesomeness emanating is just too much to handle. Congrats Ed!
Sheesh. 2.6M scoville units. As a pepperhead myself, looking forward to getting some PepperX. But i do love scorpion and reaper, they just have such wonderful flavor.  I literally finished a meal that had The cosmic disco sauce which has Scorpion in it.  Klaus is just an absolute LEGEND.
Ive been waiting for them to finally get an official scoville rating.  I have no idea why they waited so long.
No one has ever demonstrated more mad scientist vibes than Smokin' Ed describing his creative process.
Congratulations to Ed and his team!! You have worked very hard for this moment and I hope you get to enjoy the benefits! I for one will be trying this satanic creation you have introduced the world to today! Once again, fabulous work guys!!
I got last dab apollo and used it 2 times, before I gave away the bottle. No way am I trying any more last dab.
7:11 I know how it feels to want to say so much but it's a bit stuck, because of feelings and such. It's so human and a reliable moment. Good to see, love the program and what you do! Keep up the good work! ❤🎉
I have been telling people for years, there's a hotter pepper out there, it just hasn't been recognized as the hottest yet. Can't wait to show them this video!
Thank you Ed for bringing us such amazing and delicious peppers, and congratulations on the record! Much deserved!
Love it. “Did you invent this pepper?.. Yes.. Why???”😂
Ed really is the best, congratulations Ed!
You know it's going to be good when Chili Klaus is on the scene.
I'm crying 😅 ain't no way
I met Chili Klaus at the hot sauce Expo in Brooklyn, what a humble nice man! Was funny also watching him throw back these hot sauces and giving compliments on them!
The visible pain
noah’s name should be in the title (unless he didn’t want it there, of course)
This show has really gone downhill.
Dude, congratulations! I wasn’t even eating the pepper and started sweating after watching you guys take it down. Truly the hottest!
Always love seeing Chili Klaus!!!
Congrats to Chili Klaus for being in HEAT
You just see the passion in this man's work I mean come on it's been years and years and he just step the game up you got to love it man this guy is a true master of growing things I wish you would grow marijuana people wouldn't be able to stand up😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤❤
Klaus saw the ghost of Christmas past, present, and eternity with one bite.
I love a good bit spice but you can shuv that X where the sun dont shine😳🌶🌶🌶🌶
Having Ed commentate over them just dying is actually pretty cool. Also massive congrats to the man
Epic, that is a lot of pain tolerance.
Have some ghost peppers or reapers growing in my garden and u can definitely get the head rush he mentions, wonder if he would give me a seed to grow I like em right off the plant as they ripen😂😂  also edds passionate af about this his reaction to the record says it all 😊
Congrats Ed and crew! I’m scared but curious what he has next
Did you invent that? Why?
I’M IN HEAT!!!
Ah yes, men whimpering, my kink
Ed is such an absolute legend.
CHILI CLAUS IS IN HEAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm in heat 😂
Where can we get that orange heatonist trucker hat???
Love it. Love all my Last Dab sauces over the years but a raw Pepper-X?  Pass.
chili klaus!!!!
Congrats to Ed and hats off to those 4 for eating the pepper!
Get Mark Wiens on the show ! he loves eating hot stuff!
Have they tested this for fighting covid or the flu?  Im thinking the virus will want out!!!  🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️
sean didnt even eat a whole pepper dafuk?
they should try naga king chilli/ghost pepper/oomorok
Black belt hot pepper eaters
A pepper so hot you even start shaking and crying just by knowing it is the hottest pepper.
Have Vivek Ramaswamy on. He's Indian and might be comfortable with the heat! Hosting a presidential candidate would be legend!
Ed just want to watch the world burn.... Literally!
Curbjob or Pepper X your choice lol. Congrats Spice Gods!!!
I can only imagine the corporate espionage Ed gotta deal with. Man just trying to make some peppers
I've met Smokin' Ed! Puckerbutt is right down the road from my brother's house in South Carolina! (I live in Cali) I had to buy up the place! The only thing better than the quality of their seeds, sauces and merch is the quality of the people. Ed and his crew are family, and they made me feel like I was family too.
Smokin’ Ed needs to be a fixture on this show!!!
Smokin ed is a beast “I’m feeling like they are” 0 change in complexion or expression as he crushes that pepper
Chili Klaus! So great to see him again.
3:53 What does “pords” mean? Genuinely asking
13:49 Chili Klaus: " Did you do that? Did you invent that pepper?" Ed: "Yeah!" Chili Klaus: "Why?" had me ROFL.
klaus got blasted lol, i love watching his vids.
Poor Chili Klaus got destroyed by that
Congrats Ed! Amazing accomplishment.  At the same time, there is really something wrong with you.  you look as if you barely are affected by the pepper.
So when are Rhett and Link going to eat this on GMM?
Chili Klaus os the goat. So fun to watch while he's eating chilis.
Probably the biggest practical impact of the show: it's helped small businesses in the hot sauce world.
I'm in heat- klaus.
Man as a geneticist I can only imagine how many plant breeders and generations of progeny it has taken these guys to "stabilize" their pepper.
Congrats Ed! Absolutely deserved. One of my biggest regrets before I moved from Hampton Roads, VA out here to TX was not taking a drive down to the farm and shop just to see it.
Chili Klaus! Ogs have been waiting for this moment and it did not disappoint 🤣
You’re all idiots and I love you all.
Why didnt sean eat it? lame
Sean looked like someone handcuffed him and threw him down a flight of stairs. That man was in PAIN
CHILI KLAUS!!!! love to see a legend returning to the show
I am very interested to try pepper x!  Can’t wait to see how it holds up.  I am also happy for ed has done the community, and likewise to sean.  However, to be a bit of a pepper zealot, the world record company is a bit dubious at best, and i would be fairly surprised if pepper x is hotter than primotalii, the peoples champ.  Overall though congrats on breaking the record, and i can assume this will be even more good press for the pepper community as a whole.  I also have a fairly high capsaicin tolerance, and have videos testing pods if anyone is interested.  Looking forward to trying pepper x someday, and see how it stacks up against primotalii!  Cheers!
Ed is an animal.
I love how Sean and Klaus are having an Experience but Ed and the other dude are chilling, two very different sides/reactions
Chili Klaus is the G.O.A.T. of guests on Hot Ones 🔥
11:10 🦉
For the OG’s - what a ride this has been for all involved! Congrats Smokin Ed!
They must have had medics there. That is actually really scary. I'm sure this could take out many people. Great show though! Congrats to Ed on the Guinness World Record - you could tell he was really moved by this, I'm glad it does really represent a lot of hard work by him & others. Just awesome!
Even the hottest pepper in the world can’t break Ed but when he’s talking about all the work him and he’s team did and it’s finally getting validated, he breaks. He’s just a genuine guy that deserves it all
I'm in heat! 😂😂😂
No but really…………………is Klaus ok?
Hva' så Claus
Chili Klaus best man
"Did you make this? ... WHY?!" 🤣🤣🤣🤣 definite "your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they COULD, they didn't stop to think if they SHOULD" vibes. What a great segment. Thanks guys and congrats to Ed and PuckerButt. Also: Industrial chili pepper spies? That would be a hilarious movie!
I’m remember when Sean first started doin Hot Ones, man what a long journey and I’m hoping more to come 🎉🎉🎉
I cannot wait for the first X-Tali.   The cross of PepperX and Primotali is going to be savage.
Chilli klaus is a gift to humanity thank you for always having him on for these crazy taste tests 🔥🔥💨
Ed is such a humble dude, love the guy!
congratulations, ed!!!  well-deserved, sir!!!  👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Chilli's do not stack. Wisdom worth remembering.
8:36 could not have said it any better way.
12:37 "Claus is Breeding" (i'm in heat, i'm in heat, i'm in heat) 🤣🔥
Love seeing Sean and Klaus together. 😂
Ive never enjoyed watching people suffer more on a Monday AM than this. lol
It's weird to say I didn't expect tears in a video involving the hottest pepper on earth but here we are. Congrats to Ed and his team!
I just love the way you try to still hold a conversation. ❤️
THE SNAPS ARE BACK
Holly Molly
Send it to Rhett and link 😂
Now we need Gordon try it
_"Congratulations, you're officially amazing!"_ 🥲 This video is making me so happy. 🥹
2.7 million scoville. Yeahi wont be eating pepper X!!!   🤯
Badasses, the four of you. Congrats to Smokin’ Ed, and props to the whole crew!
The pepper tastes hella good y’all. It has a lime/citrus/sweet taste and the heat is immediate.  Taste better than the reaper.
Hes a mad scientist. Like just why?
Ed is so passionate, it's heart-warming. Wonderful to see. I wish I could taste some of his chillies/peppers here in South Africa. What a guy. Also, great to see Chilli Klaus again
CONGRATULATIONS ED!🥲🥰💖 🎉🎈🎊 🔥🌶🔥 🎊🎈🎉
I was expecting to the guinness guy to eat it too..
Chili Klaus!!!! The legendary chili viking is back!!
When is “da bomb” GROUND ZERO coming to hot ones????
So happy for Ed! Congrats man.
Guinness is bs. But that pepper is prolly no joke.
Congratulations, you’ve made a biological weapon.
👍👍👍❤❤❤
I don’t know if Ed wants to know this or not, but I’ve always thought that the last dab was always the best sauce, I didn’t even care about the spice, how it tasted on a Boo’s cheesesteak (if you know you know) is something I still crave. And I can recognize pepper x’s taste anywhere.   Also, yeah Apollo was the instant attack of pepper x, but had the growing sensation of a natural hot pepper. But I still believe the reaper is the hottest. They’re might be a limit to what the human tongue can comprehend if the stats say the other peppers are higher
"I am in HEAT" - Chili Klaus
Never seen Sean go cross-eyed before. 🤣
Must protect Klaus at all cost. "I'm in heat" 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Let’s gooooooo!
"but that comes on later, when you're in pain."
😂❤❤
He can eat reapers like candy. You know it's something special to him when the award is what got him choked up. Congratulations Ed!
Congrats Ed for your dedication creating the world's hottest pepper!  I wonder why Dragon's Breath doesn't succeed Carolina Reapers before this?
"That comes on later when your in pain"😂
My daughter surprised me with a Hot Ones gift box for my birthday. 😊 Klaus got me with “I think there’s some Oak in it, some Pencil”😂😂😂
Some people say he's still in heat to this day
Wow. Fantastic. Brave muthuah f#^ker’s.   Congratulations
I clicked for some Chili Klaus hiccups and snaps and I was NOT disappointed 😂 congrats on all your hard work Smokin Ed!!
"I've got a little bit of a tear in my eye"  -Ed  💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Good work Ed, you can tell he's very proud.
I am literally in the middle of going back through O.G. Hot Ones, all the way back to Jimmy's 43. This is perfect timing! Can't believe it's been 7 years
For sure buying this last dab sauce.
Chili Klaus is awesome! Congrats on the achievement!
Well it was enough to induce false mating season in Klaus
Fnally we get to see someone eat raw Pepper X.   Its only been like 5 years.
I'm in heat
Nobody noticed Ed just ate the pepper x like a candied jalapeno... No reaction...
"Im in heat" amazing.
Pepper X (formerly known as Pepper Twitter)
13:49 I could not stop laughing once they took the peper. Im in freaking tears 😂😂😂
Sean + Klaus + Ed = the holy trinity
“I’m in Heat.”  God love Klaus.  He was so far into the weeds he just couldn’t finish his sentence.
That was absolutely the most perfect place for him to receive the Guinness record
It looks like parts of the pepper litterally want to leave itself XD
Congratulations Ed Currie for ending up in the Guinness book of world records for the hottest pepper in the world 2.6+ million scoville units !!! 🎉🥳🍾
Oh my God, they killed Klause!
I would not eat this. I stop at habanero's
You guys are so brave. 😊 ❤
I love Chili Klaus!
You got thrown under the bus their bro😂 As the host, you get to take the shots. K+
When it’s too much for professionals why would I do anything but watch?
Someone check on Klaus
I never thought about it like that... One stolen pepper could ruin Puckerbutt. The security around those fields must be TIGHT.
Smokin' Ed is like the most honest guy  He just wants to make hot peppers, its so sweet
Congratz Ed!!
Yessssssss!!! Congrats from all of us in the Pepper Community!
They have a legendary bathroom now
"IM IN HEEEAT!"
FINALLY 🤣
Welcome back Chili!! Eds a stone cold Pepper OG
How do I buy it to grow
"This is more hot than my scandanavian cousins." and now we have "I'm in heat." Chili Claus getting lost in translation from peppers is now a Hot Ones tradition.
i have tried a carolina reaper one time, and i was too scared to do it one more time. How insane the pepper x most be 🥵
Ed is a LEGEND!
I love Chili Klaus! Him and Sean together make for the best entertainment around. I'm dying. 🤣😆🤣
Wait - why was Sean eating a tiny piece only? Did i see that correctly?
La Cosa Nostra of hot peppers
It’s hard to understand anyone thinking a pepper that hot would even be considered for its flavor.
You need to get that guy that doesn't get affected by hot peppers on your show
epic, legend, historical  thank you
I still haven't tried to eat the new last dab it seems so crazy. I need a group to come be apart of it.
In short  - best episode ever. Legendary! 🔥
Chili Klaus is in heat? owo
Idk why but "pencil" made me laugh lol.
Watching Sean Fanboy over Chili Klaus was definitely the spicy icing on top of this fantastically delicious Pepper X Cake.
There is something legitimately wrong with Ed’s neurons 😂😂😂
"The skin fits tighter to your face" I lost it 🤣
😂😭 Brilliant. Was concerned for Klaus’s wellbeing for a second 😂
1:30 That thing just looks like pure evil 👹
The moment I saw Chili Klaus in the thumbnail I put everything down to watch this. I love when these two (and now three) get together.
The Holy Trinity of Spice Lords: The Father, The Son and The Holy Host!
santaa claus is back
That doesn’t look as bad as the reaper when they did them together.
Mad Pepper Scientist! Genius...True Genius!
I'm so excited to watch eeeeee
Is chili Klaus OK?!?
I just learned about this guy the other day. He was literally the definition of pure evil for making and bringing such a horrible thing into this world. A real live evil genius.
I'm in heat!
I feel a little bad for Klaus. Can you imagine the terror in the back of that man's mind every time he gets an email or a call from Sean's team?
3:07 god isnt real, but the devil is green.  (In hind sight this could apply to the peoper itself but im talking about money)
Congratulations Ed keep it spicy brother 🎉
This is so sweet. Love this show. xoxoxo
Love his dedication to his craft. Great that he and his team get their flowers and official validation.🎊 BTW Ed could bake ceramics in his mouth, he's so calm - holy moly😬 And Klaus: "I'm in heat!"😂🌶🌶🌶
“I’m in heat” 😂😂😂
These guys are LEGENDS 😂😂😂😂 I bet they can drink the bomb to cool off
Ed eats so many hot peppers his body is melting
Ed just casually chewing his pepper while everyone else is dying😂😂😂
12:27 “I’m in heat.” 😂
Ed always brings a energy that shows that he loves what he does 🙌🏾🔥
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Bro is giving a whole speech while everyone around him is suffering 😂😂😂 absolute UNIT
Congratulations Ed!
I need more of these guys in my life. One of the greatest videos of all time
I'd marry Chili K.
its a pity guiness is corrupt
Man those are some yellow chompers. Buddy needs to brush
I think it's got coke in it!!!! 😂😅
Man its such a fkn pleasure seeing Sean and Klaus on screen again! Ed getting the recognition from Guinness, the team really appreciating how much it means to him, and last but not the least 12:21 WHAT 😂😂😂😂
Ed seems to have even more resistance than Johnny Scoville
Ed narrating while everyone is dying in the background is the content I came for - congrats on the record and salute to all who suffered on this one! Y'all the real MVPs!
Chili Klaus is my absolute favorite guest!!
Such a great video! So glad Ed and the team got more validation and recognition for all their hard work. Great video! I cannot wait to try a PepperX!
Buzzfeed owns this?
Seriously I like heat but I don't like it we're there is so much heat you have to sign a waiver just to eat it. I like a balance of heat and flavor but honestly I would like try pepper x just once...my poo will burn coming out
I started sweating watching them eat the peppers 😂
Nice to see the whole rouge squad together thanks for this
“I’m out like Chili Klaus” should be a T-Shirt
Lol watching people in pain is beautiful
Ed must be totally dead inside. I love it!
You know it's spicy when Chili Klaus starts snapping his fingers lol
"I'm in heat"   "He's breeding!"
I love these specials. I swear I can feel the heat through the screen.
I'm in heat
The typical american thing to say: no introduction needed. This is:😂
The difference between the left side and the right side of the table after eating the Pepper X is almost comical  😁
"Taste like OAK.."
If you get a new pepper, you should invite Roger from The Hot Dang Show (here on YouTube) to come on as a taste tester. He just put out a video where he used pretty much an entire bottle of Xperience on a pulled pork sandwich. The guy is a legend.   Edit: I just realized somebody might think I'm trying to promote myself. Trust me, that Roger is not me. We just share a first name. I could never eat that much heat.
CHILI CLAUS!!!! Its been a while. Love this man.
Ed is a BEAST!
Klaus is breeding!
Congratulations Ed!!! I would be dying like Chilli Klaus if I ate that pepper, which I will never do!  ;)
Congrats to Ed! I now feel obliged to get my hands on one :D
I guess Taylor Swift should be the next guest!
11:36 oh my god, the way chili Claus says 'I love that flavour' while in so much disconfort is absolutely hilarious 😂
Can't believe Sean didn't eat a whole one...
I actually had a bead of sweat at my hairline just watching you guys!  Crazy.
Holy!!! Klaus is the freaking man!!! Good to see him back!!! You guys are crazy!!! But I love it!!!! Cheers guys!!!!
so is it just going to get to the point where it finally gets so hot that it melts someones esophagus?? i mean honeslty how can it just continue to get hotter?
always glad to see Chili Klaus
Dang even the pepper itself looks mean lol. It's all spiky and alien looking, Such an angry pepper lol.
Chili Klaus is a true chili legend.
That does not look like a pleasurable experience at all. I want to try it.
Do these guys ever get colonoscopies done? If so, I wanna hear from their doctors!
OHHH WOW
He said it taste like oak and a pencil!!!✏️ 😂😂😂
"IM IN HEAT" 😂
Poor Chili Klaus … RIP my Danish friend
Can that be normally grown or only in special circumstances I know not available to the public just curious how it's done
A couple of National symbols of insanity of Denmark and USA.
Chili Klaus has to remake the chili orchestra performances, now featuring Pepper X :D
You need to do more with chili Klaus. I miss seeing him on the show. Love that guy!❤
So Hot!!
YEEEEHAAAAA!!! Klaus is back <3
I lost my mind at the "I'm in heat..." bit. Pure comedy gold.
Welcome back Chili Klaus!!!
"I'm in heat"  🤣
What is truly scary is Ed might have peppers hotter the world will never see since there is no one crazy enough to try.
Congrats to Ed and the team! So happy for Ed and his acheivments!
ooh wee
As DJ Khaled would say "Another One"
I think Sean just lost 5 years off of his lifespan with that pepper haha.
Never thought I'd see Chili Klaus speechless. 😲🤣🤣🤕
Tried this on a Chicken Tikka sandwich, SUPERB!!!!
Ed seemed more normal after eating the pepper.
whatever these guys do, all those decades of hard work, still can't beat Da Bomb... not even with the "hottest pepper" on the planet?? I don't get it
FINALLY!
The crunch of the peppers was incredible
"I'm in heat!" Lolz
Oh, no Sean... every time you and Chili Klaus do this I can only imagine how awful you feel the rest of the day, and frankly the next.  Hope this too shall pass, even if it burns as bad coming out as it did going in...
Klaus: "I'm in heat..." 😂
CHILI KLAUUUUSSSSSSSS
Congrats Ed and team. I appreciate all the work you have done to increase awareness of spicy things. While I will avoid pepper X in its raw form I will enjoy it in sauces 😅
Only complaint is that the video wasn't longer
10 years later, a 2 year quarantine, 15+ hot ones seasons, a lot of smoke from “breeders”. Pepper X is the new jewel to ed’s crown.
Congrats, Ed! But ya'll are just plain nutz! 😂 I LOVE hot sauce and can easily handle 1mill.SHU sauces in moderation, but this crosses all sorts of lines for me, haha! So kudos to you, fellas! Doing what others can't and making it look essy.
ed eats it like its bubblegum
Ed's just like... good pepper
One of the gifts of getting older is witnessing something beautiful like this channel & its community grow from small channel to a community of shared passion, just look how happy he looked getting that plaque 😀  Thanks guys & keep on keeping on
This was legendary ❤
Eds gonna grow a pepper and its just gonna peel away to solid chunks of Capsaicin
That is truly amazing! Scary as though
Amazing ! This will heal* more  than you imagine !  *Capsaicina IS MEDICINE FOR PAIN.  I use it !  Thanks ALL OF YOU,
Chili Klaus, YEAH!! I missed that guy!!
I don’t know about you guys, but I can’t taste anything but pain when I eat these!
Congrats Ed!
Congrats Ed!
Smokin' Ed is so cute and Chili Klaus is INSANE. I love it!
yall are gonna have some wild kidney stones or something some day
Y'all are crazy and we are so here for it!
You guys aint right in the head.
The spicy boys are back at it
Imagine distilling this and aerosolizing it, probably way worse than pepper spray could ever be
Wait, it's like an aphrodisiac?
Congrats Ed! Hope to be able to try the fresh pepper in the future! Incredible 🔥
Proud pepper patriot
Chili Fkn Klaus!
Chili Klaus says 10 out of 10 ouha's, would snap fingers again.
As soon as I saw Chili Klaus, my first thought was, "He's gonna get the hiccups."
Rip colons
Congratulations to Ed and all his team! And to Hot Ones for continuing to bring us the suffering of celebrities and normals alike.
Congrats to Ed! Love to see Klaus on the set, especially as a Scandinavian. The madman ate a whole Pepper X lol.
Yaaaay Chili Klaus is back! Let's gooooo!
That thing just LOOKS demonic. I can't even imagine eating it.
can you bring us the pepper that look of despair lol
Smokin Ed cries over his friends and family and all they do yo help him. Barely bat's an eye at Pepper X. Everyone else is ballin their eyes out over Pepper X.
This just felt right! =0)
Ed is scared to sell me seeds😂
No better way to start my Monday!
The video we never asked for. But some how we got it.
“It continues”
Always love seeing Klaus, he's such a great guy
4 GOATS 🐐🐐🐐🐐
Ed seems like a very genuine, amazing and insane kinda guy. You gotta love it
Smokin’ Ed is the only person to get more choked up _talking_ about chili peppers than eating them.
DAMMMMMM SEAN!
Almost 2.7 million Scoville.. ouch, lol.
Ed is a fantastic lunatic. watching him just stand there after eating that thing while CK is dying. incredible.
👍😂 good for him
I swear I was just thinking to myself that Sean and Chili Klaus needed a reunion.
Finally a Scoville for the last dab
"some oak and pencil..." 😂😂
I was just re-watching the other Klaus episodes and i wished so hard for exactly THIS! Thank you so much! ❤
No Chilli Klaus’s we’re hurt in making this epi…..
I can't believe I'm getting emotional over a hot pepper world record.
I don’t understand how Sean hasn’t gotten an ulcer yet from how much spice he eats😬 or maybe he has idk🤷🏻‍♀️
"I'm in heat!"  ☠️☠️🤣
How Ed just devours the pepper X and does not flinch one bit is just nothing short of impressive
Really need to get the next world's hottest pepper named something like Fairy Gumdrop or whatever. World be funny going from Carolina Reaper and Pepper X, to strawberry daisy. Lol
Oh dear, Ed's over there grinning like he's showing everybody his favorite child.  That's a bad sign.  And you know that pepper is belligerent when Sean immediately flushes red.  Wonderful pepper, wonderful episode with Chili Klaus, thanks all for finding the burn.
Hahaha....awesome
Epic meeting! All my heroes!
Wikipedia and most other sites still say C. Reaper. Time for an update!
So happy to see Chili Claus back on the show again. Without him there would be no chilli love in the Nordic countries. He opened up the market for the rest.
wow. it’s uhhh been a minute. cause i have no idea who tf those dudes are lol.
I’d like to think that if you made an extract of that sauce and dropped it on the top floor of a building it would melt through each floor, like the acid blood scene from Alien!😂
When will the seeds be available?
The Pepper Godfather has made history once again. Props to Smokin’ Ed.
Props to Chili for taking a whole pepper to the head!  Congrats to the Pepper King, the legend, Ed Currie!!  Dude still commenting while everyone else is struggling was hilarious.
"....I'm in heeeeat...." ---- LOL
The ads are still playing but I expect this to be a video of PAIN. I love Chili Klaus!!❤️🌶️ adding…CONGRATS ED! WOOT!!!
Today we are All in heat.
I LOVE every day I see Chili Klaus in a FWF video ❤❤❤
based
I miss Chili Klaus and often use his phrase "It's very flavorful" when describing hot/spicy
The holy trinity of Flame!
From their genuine reaction to the pepper, I won't be surprised if the CIA start using these during interrogations as torture device lol
Ed is an alien, keeping his composure...Only way thats possible
Nothing better could have dropped into my feed, pure bliss to watch 🌶️ ❤
Claus is in heat, maybe his hotter scandinavian cousins need to watch out 😂🤣
Tearing up. You guys are awesome!
Amazing seeing Klaus
I would love for Sean to have a Contest where people send in their audition videos telling him why they would love to be on his show. Then the winner would get to do a Hot Ones Episode 🎉
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽🎇🎉🎊 I really enjoyed this. I will never ever eat that a girl habaneros in jalapeños and Serrano’s and I think that’s my limit.
The passion of creating the most powerful and spiciest pepper is incredibly inspiring and diabolical. 😅 Excellent work to Ed and the team. What an intense return for Klaus.
Liked solely for Ed Curries reaction to the award
Am I the only one who needs to see an extended post credits?
classic
"What do you think of the flavor, Klaus?" Hahah old Ed had me dying 😂 what a legend he is!
LOL, thank you for suffering for our entertainment. much love to you all!
Love Chili Klaus
The Three Legends in the same video. This is gonna be spicy
LOL! after the credits - Klaus: "Did you invent that pepper?" Ed: "yeah" Klaus: "Why?"
😁😁😁👍👍👍🌶🌶🌶👍👍👍
I've been waiting for this!!  I only live about an hour from PuckerButt Pepper Company.. I can't wait to go check one of these out!
Yooo finally after 5 years Chili Klaus is back! Lets go!! So happy as a danish person myself that klaus is on here once again.
I started sweating just watching you guys 😂
I'm in heat... 😂😂😂
This episode is hotter than my Scandinavian cousin
Just by looking at it, you can tell that it's fire.😂😂😂😂
I wonder what a heelish chillie came when tehs 2 legend grow a chillie togther
Chili Klaus saying "I love the flavor. I think there is some oak in it." while simultaneously dying is the funniest thing ever... 🤣🤣🤣
awesome stuff congrats
Chili Klaus episodes are so great!! Another chicken wing episode with Chili Klaus please!!!!
My guess is the 2024 paqui one chip challenge will have pepper X
part of me wants to try this but I gotta work my way up the ladder, poor klaus his reaction was priceless though
I was afraid of touching my eyes the whole time watching.
I absolutely love Ed's enthusiasm to his craft and growing Pepper X, everyone should take as much pride in something they love to do in the same way that Ed does.
Congratulations man. I have never thought i would see Chilli Klaus like that .... This is truly a weapons grade pepper .
Chili Klaus!!
Ed is such a likeable guy..the way he loves and explains peppers is amazing
Wow, such an amazing moment to happen casually on youtube
“I’m in heat”  “He is breeding now”  😂
Nice send me one Ed I'll film it
Got an official Scoville level not just TBD!
We got more tears from Ed about the World Record than from the pepper! The man is a BEAST!
I'm so happy for Smokin' Ed!
Congratulations
Ed’s a legend
🔥
Ed is great 🥲
the brothers are LEGNEDS!!
I'm out
Really admire Ed's dedication to his team. Congratulations!
These 4 together is awesome. Always love seeing chili klaus and ed
Congrats to Ed and the team! We may leave the tasting to you guys…
The best part of this video was Ed getting his plaque.  You could see all the hard work, all the passion, all the love he puts into what he does, and his first thought was to thank his team.  Be like Ed, everyone.
good to see Chili Klaus back on the show
hows ed just standing there xD
Ed is some sort of monster. I know it’s your job and you’ve ostensibly become the pepper god but man at least try and put  on a show
When Chili klaus starts asking why... Its like that "Can we do it? Yes. Should we do it?"
"I'm in Heat" 🗿🗿😂😂😂
Even for Klaus this one was painfull he was not ok after
I Wana eat one
Ohhh this one can only be good.  *finger snap snap snap snap*  😆
Love me some Chilli Klaus
I use Apallo as a replacement for ketchup, and have not had a head high from a hot sauce yet, hiccups if I eat reaper or hotter too fast yes lol sweating when I eat more than one Berger slathered with Apallo yup but a head rush . . . I have not had the pleasure as of yet but I look fword to it.
Andy gives me such Bubble's vibes (trailer park boys) in all the best ways😊
"I am in HEAT." - Chili Klaus 💀
This is classic
Ed is a mad scientist of pepper 😂
Ed tearing up when he was trying to thank his team first...  Thats a true leader.
at what point does it turn into weapons development?
As it been tested against the chocolate primotalii?
This is just as cool as a Hot Ones episode.
Everyone is dying. Ed just explaining what’s happening as you eat it. Just smiling lol
Congratulations Ed, you are the greatest. Keep them coming.
ITS HAPPENING OH MY GOD ITS HAPPENING
Ed is awesome!
Chili Klaus is a super hero.
Hahahahahaha
Ed can't be broken by spice but his tender heart is touched by the confirmation of his life work and validation on his dreams
This is an amazing surprise to find on a monday! and big congrats to Smokin' ed on the new record! Love seeing Chili Klaus on the set who was my introduction to spicy youtube content way back during or before season 1 of Hot Ones. been a big fan ever since then and enjoyed the whole evolution of hot ones and the specials with Chili Klaus indeed!
Congratulation Ed!
KLAUS IS IN HEAT 💀💀
"I love seeing you, but I also dont like it" Sean is such a legend hes disrespectful in most respectful way ever
DREAM COME TRUE. Smokin ed and Chili Klaus have been my most re-watched vids of this channel BY FAR. The goats of the spicy world.
Thanks for taking another one for the team Sean and Klaus!
The video where u eat the carolina reaper is to this day one of the funniest videos I've ever seen. So glad to see the sequel!
😂🤣😂🤣
Never thought I’d get choked up listening to a guy talk about hot peppers
I hope you add this in your hot wings show
Sådan Klaus!
I keep reading that as “pepper twitter” 😂
If Klaus says "I'm done" Ima pass 💯
I started sweating just listening.😅😂😢
Ed's emotion when speaking about the team just shows he puts his life essence into this work.  Congratulations Ed and Puckerbutt team!!
CHILI KLAUS!!!!!!!!!!!
Congrats to Smokin' Ed Currie for breaking a new Guinness World Record for hottest chili pepper! Like if you need more content with Ed and Chili Klaus.
🍿
The OG fans have been waiting, thank you
Another Chili entry!  This is number 4 or 5 I think.
We all love Chili Klaus, so excited he's back!
Pepper X should sue Elon!
Chili Klaus & Smokin' Ed Currie together? Lets Gooooo!
Sean is a legend. The moment he wants to pivot into the traditional, non-spicy food talk show space, I'm supporting him and his crew.
Always love to see Chili Klaus.
The Father, The Son, and The Holy Sean.    Freaking loved this video.
all the rich youtubers buy a rolex now huh?
LFG!!!
CHILI KLAUS

Noti squad
Oh NO! Sean, Ed, AND KLAUS?!!?!?!?    ❤❤❤
A glutton for punishment.
Oh boy
They found a way to go even FURTHER BEYOND and that scares and excites me. Cant wait to see what comes out of the X
I was literally thinking about Chili Klaus the other day and was like, "What ever happened to that guy? He was awesome." Lo and behold!
