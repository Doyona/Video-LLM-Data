Stay the hell away from my girlfriend England knows about your cheating
Wow they removed all the negative comments 😂 classic
1:31 67
Tom Jones sucks
Thank you James for this all amazing years I will miss you❤  You are in our hearts and don't forget do your favorite things in your life
Este es uno de los malp4ridos miembros de la elite.
We hear they want to kill Jeff's family in Florida well I hope they do
I bet the USA is glad that he's moved back to the UK.  It's more expensive to live over there too. 😊
And then Trump came back...
i only found this show a year ago and now it’s cancelled. society needs more James Corden! not controversial or mean.
What is this song
I think my heart broke with James at the end.
I would have preferred Patrick Stewart as a fiinal guest.
I don't care what anybody says. I truly loved James Corden and still do. He got thrown into stardom suddenly and no-one helped correct or guide him on his way up but were quick to rip him down publicly and destroy him in the end. That says more about them then it does James in my book. If they'd cared, they would have helped him. I think they sat back and waited for their moment out of jealousy. xo.
Hello Jeff is doing well in the witness protection program seriously He's alive and kicking that was a fake funeral that's why we didn't go😅
17:52 the girl fainted 😂
no vuelvas más gordo
This should have literally been a 5 hour special
Why did you get married then if you're going to cheat on your wife
What the Hell
Hello we have our lawyers following Billy we want you people to stay the hell away from him you have a lot of nerve trying to kill Jeff and innocent man
i miss one direction
The girl who fainted after fist-pumping Harry? Oh no same girl, completely understand
❤❤❤❤
What did he do that was so bad?  Never read anything about it.
Who cares if Jeff's family in Florida was abused by the alcoholic drunk daddy they probably deserved it
I missed this whole thing which i regret, but glad i can see reruns..especially carpool karaoke!
BRAVO JAMES❤🙏👏👏👏👏🍁🍁🍁💐💐💐
No!!!! I just found you yesterday!!!! I binge watched for 12 hours!!! This 73 year old will miss your healing humor! ❤ 🇨🇦 🍁 🇨🇦
2025 anyone?
H
I still came back from time to time...
Hey Miss James you're the one that's stupid and foolish we will never kiss Irene's nasty black ass
Hey your games with the royals and Trump didn't work are lawyers have our money and we pay for our housekeeping sorry bud😢
I loved the SAFETY GLASSES,  gotta protect the eyes❤
As   I  don't  get  the  show  in  Australia,  but  I  love   all  the  stuff  he  has  done   with  Tom  Cruise   !!!!
Famous James the vice president was not satisfied today everybody knows
This is the first time i have ever watched his show. I only saw a few carpool ones and Tom Cruise, that one was amazing. I think your really funny. A really happy person that is a delight to see in our world today. Now i have 8 yrs of catching up. God Bless you James and your family.
I would have liked to have seen Tom Hanks and Mila Kunis as the final show guests just because they were the first.
watching harry say "i dont see why we wouldnt" in 2025 now liam is gone is absolutely heartwrenching.
❤❤❤🎉😢😂😂😂

Trying to get Brian Kelly to lie about us to make yourself look good you make me sick
Irene's mother the real elephant that nasty botch.
Go to your own goddamn restaurants stay the hell out of our lives
He didn’t whine like Colbert
And now we are losing Stephen Colbert. Late night shows are becoming a thing of the past
Can't believe it was his last show😢
Who cares
It is indeed important to recognize what the world thinks of the US. Great TV shows, high quality IT products, imperialism, child poverty, gun crime, opioid epidemic, coups d'etat, militarism, theocracy and child marriage.
Jeff callsindu the real fool 😢😢
Jeff don't give a crap about Mindy and the family😮
23:29 Fast Forward to October 16th 2024 we got confirmation that the reunion is forever impossible 😢,but we got it on the 20th of November only at a funeral 😢,RIP Liam James Payne 1993-2024 it still feels unreal that you’re No longer here Liam We Miss You So Much You will always live on in all our hearts Legend,one More time RIP Liam James Payne 1993-2024

Memories of souvenirs I'll show your wife you're cheating pictures
Watching this in 2025 still makes me to cry. I truly enjoyed watching James in all of his shows. ❤ love from SRI LANKA
They call Mindy the real fool ha ha ha I

Brian Kelly is giving out wrong information
We know where your wife and kids live
Irene nasty bush
Jeff yalked to the cops about irene and mindy teally
Love your message, James
Missing him already
Amen
Trump today's meeting
C'mon Corden, come back! 1 Million for a show really isn't progressive
Cordon simply is Great, and Britain 😊
Sincerity. If you can fake that nobility awaits.
Why was this show his last????
😂😂😂 that intro was hilarious
Jeff calls ugly mindy the teal fool ha ha 😅
Manny hrossman a creep 🎉
Had nice fun evenings.
You were the WORST late night talk show host ever and you will not be missed.
love u James!! rewatching it again
There should be a D reunion in memory of Liam😢
U GUYS KNOW THE SHOW ENDED CUZ HE IS JUST LIKE ELLEN...A HORRIBLE HUMAN BEING, AND EVENTUALLY KARMA CATCHES UP.....HE KNOWS HIS BEHAVIOR IS WHAT ENDED HIS CAREER.. POETIC TO ME
Hihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi lo cancelaron por pendejo
I just don't get why they had to end it. Such a bummer. Love James! ❤ 😢
After Letterman never cared much for this show. Hence never heard of this guy and 8yrs? No offense but that is a mere drop in the bucket compared to Carson, Griffin, Leno and Letterman etc. All the talk show hosts current or since. No matter the network or platform, just do not have the type of charisma, experience much the talent that all the OG talkshow hosts have or had.  Remember Arsenio Hall or Pat Sajak? Both don't get it wrong are very talented in other fields, but NOT as talk show hosts.
The world hasn't been the same since these shows stopped :(
His final show and they locked him out. Why? That was just so cruel and unjustified. Very amateurish behaviour by so-called professionals.
That was a wonderful camping trip for Billy he enjoyed it
With  "After Midnight" being canceled finally. I wish CBS would bring back James Corden and The Late Late Show.
James is the biggest One Direction fan 😄❤love it.
I struggled with active addiction for 11 years b4 going to treatment in May 2021. We don't screw our lives up in a short time we also don't get everything we lost back in a short time. This past year has been the most devastating and depressing of my entire life. My Mom who was 1 of the most incredible ladies anyone could ever meet. She was kind, loving, had tremendous faith and every good quality in me , came from her. She passed away unexpectedly very early on Christmas morning 2023. I was devastated, I didn't think I could feel any worse but 10 weeks later I lost my 33 year old daughter who was one of my 3 best friends, My Mom, my daughter and my son. I really never thought I would smile again let alone laugh but I started watching clips of James Corden's carpool kareoke , which led me to the late late show and I did start smiling and laughing. Its been 15 months since Mommy died and 13 since my daughter died. I am still clean and sober !!!! And I still have moments everyday that brings me to tears but thanks to this sweet man and his absolutely hilarious sense of humor I've had lots of moments where I have smiled and laughed so hard tears were pouring, happy tears. I wish I had been able to watch you all along while you were on James Corden but I am enjoying catching up on everything. If you had not retired coming to your show would have definitely been on my bucket list. Thank you for helping to ease the hardest most difficult days of my life. That's an incredible gift to have. I LOVE YOU JAMES & I don't even know you !!! God bless you and your beautiful  family !!!! Hug them extra and make every moment count bcuz none of us are promised tomorrow!!!
Absolutely 💯 💯 💯 😂😂😂😂😊
Why was he cancelled
They know about Billy
He would still have his show is he was nicer to  people .. another ELLEN ..  everyone on here knows that .. if your not in the entertainment bizz.. he has no time time for you or manners..  so suck it...
Watching this back and now I'm even more sad because Liam.... </3
A Man with great Talents ❤ and so very funny, that I will be a little sad 😢❤😊
Billy wear wites
28:10 😅😅😅😅😅 harrys face
To spit or to swallow that is the question
Im surprised nobody called harry daddy
And he shook my hand
I would have cried if i touched harry
Saddest night ever… but not for James. Thank you for your service man!
GOD BLESS YOU
17:51 Did anyone else notice the girl faint after fist bumping Harry Styles? 😮😅
James, this country is binge watching your videos praying for better days. I'm praying they will get us thru these next 4 years.
Thank god he’s fucking gone
Cordon sucked awful host awful person i cannot believe he was on the air as long as they allowed
I  miss
Love his acting at the start of this show acting all nicey nice to his staff when everyone knows he’s the exact opposite.  His show didn’t run out of money. He was cancelled for being a talentless, nasty piece of work, we hate him in the UK and the US can keep him.
Good riddance
Harry stylles,  cabeçudo, vc saia de perto do James,  esse homem te adora
16:38 16:39
Whos the guy in the blue
Harry styles need to not forget his accent... my neighbour james cordon , whos been there longer ,doesn't  ?....
End of a era
Can you pls do a collaborative with Straykids or enhypen?
I MISSS U COME BACK
Health department found out about the doctor's drugs
James is an utter bellend.
It's been a year, and this show is still the best Thanks for everything James Greetings from Peru, you will always be the best, thanks for everything
Is doctor got in trouble with the drugs poor thing
Sorry chef knows everything he will never get in
uhm yeah I am here after Liam's death and just cried after I saw how excited James got after Harry's answer to the One Direction Reunion question
And harry 🎉
Lol harry and he from England but yeah think blaming trump on this one. Sorry trump but yeah he gets bad vibes from lots over world so yeah did trump make him leave???
Alles von ihm finde ich nicht gut und trifft meinen Geschmack nicht. Ansonsten prima Beiträge.
TRY 1960
we lost james, we lost ellen. Honestly i find the other shows feel to fake. In my opinion, all of the great shows have now died.
I’m going to watch SNL The Continental 🤑🤫🤬
When is Harry going to stop wearing Gucci? 😴😑🤒
It’s David Letterman 15:49 🤢
the 1D reunion part :'(
you are all amazing
Man, I wish the president's duties were to appear on a midnight show and not try to invade other countries. Again
PREACH!! James May You and your Family be FOREVER BLESSED!! PLEASE REMEMBER what it was like eight years ago America!! Look for the JOY and spread LIGHT !!❤💯🙋🏻‍♀️🙏😇🎸💕🥳🤣🎶 Be like James and sing like you're ADELE A DIVA, and dance like nobody's watching!!!!
Still loved the Skeleton and the old Scottish fella. More laughing then singing and crying.  Craig Ferguson will live in Late night history with most non cooperate host ever.
Harry should’ve sung sign of the times, “welcome to the final show” 😭
He seriously quit the show bc he didn’t think $6M a year was enough? How unbelievably privileged. Wow.
They missed a trick not getting Craig Ferguson in that first segment
I miss him. He was so hilarious.
James corden the most horrible human being that I've ever met. If you don't believe me ask anyone that worked with him.
Why is this the last episode? Any reason
James corden had an awesome show
This was the best show! Wish it would start again
Jeff did file a lawsuit against Mindy really 🎉
Love James Gordon in gavin and Stacey    he's very funny 😂😅
missing this
SO GLAD THIS WOKE PROGRAM IS DONE. GONE WITH ALL THIS SHIT!!
Te amo One Direction
Te amo Harry Styles
America signifies absolute headquarters of the dark corrupt evil controlling world order along with the BRF and the wealthy. Look for the humanity and the light but no country especially not USA has the source of it!
I enjoyed his show
16:40 👀
Is it just me or is that Richard Ayode’s voice during the first clip?
I’m devastated that James didn’t take the chance for his final show to kidnap all of 1D and make them be together again.
Thank god it’s over hopefully no more of this prick
I hope you're having a nice life now
Unfeasibly gross luvvy. To all the yanks out there this two does not show UK 'talent' in the best light. A mediocrity at best😮
37:25 I thought that was RON
Love this James! I am 95.95% sure I watched this and one other episode all the way through. But YouTube of Carpool Karaoke gave and gives me life! Each one was Brilliant. Thank you my friend. ❤🍊
Thank you CBS and James for making me laugh through the years.   I wish you well in your future endeavors.  You will be missed.
Mindy the real fool ha haha
Why are they doing this ，they cancel the show，this hurts me so much.😢
babysh cc💒🏩💒🗼🏙️🌇📺❤
Will miss the laughter, the fun and your beautiful smile l love the episode with  Liam Payne
thanks man, good show, good moments..
Who knew he was such an arse hole
Song slapped
<3
Such fun! ❤
Harry and those ridiculous clothes!!
Joe Biden...👎👎👎👎
Hello Jeff won the lawsuit against the ex Russian landlord seriously he won a lot of money good luck to him🎉
I think I am going to cry now!😊❤
a reunion is not possible anymore😢
OMG I love it
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Not me crying watching this an entire year later. Miss seeing you James!!
Jeff knows who paid Manny Grossman off  so does the feds
Boy this was funny as all hell! Loved it! He acted so well, you really think it was real! Great acting! I miss him!? Lydia! 🎉
James is crazy about Harry🤮
hearing the one direction question: 😭
:( crying at the one direction reunion question
Can you please give us a show with one direction
This was so beautiful🥺 I miss the late late show
Suck that dock
Did that girl faint right after she fist bumped harry?
I was a bit surprised that the Biebs wasn’t there.
I miss the days when everything was fine
Harry is the nicest celebrity I've ever seen, and many celebrities adore him🥹
I love this show and watching the brotherhood with Harry through the years . When he said I have to say I'm selfishly excited your coming home. 🏹💓.  That hit me 💕
Gay and pedo?
James is a natrually funny guy ,this show has been great with him ❤❤😁😄
Will should go on ,im a  celebrity get me out of here lol 😁😄😃😀
Dhar Mann has a big mouth tells everybody about the weekend sex party's
28:13 Harry can’t ever hide his expressions😹
Me watching this now there never will be a one direction reunion. We miss you Liam 🕊
So much fun watching your show James Corden especially with 1 Direction and their solo appearances specially with Harry Styles.
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍❤
tkkkk
Still cannot find his neck!
Guys was this show really even that good?
20:49 his pissing of😂😂 HS LP ZM LT NH 1D❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥🥹😔
I love you, James   come back someday after family is ok with it. And you!! You are a light to so many!❤
The Late Night Allstars bit is effing GOOD!!!!! Was not expecting that!!!!!!!
17:53 did she faint?? Because mood lmao
James’ ability to hold it together is impressive!
harry's question and answer hits different now 😢. there wont ever be the 'right' time without liam 🕊
"Will there be a One Direction reunion?"  me in October 2024: 😭😭😭
i kind of like that show but something about Corden I did not appreciate. I have not miss him one second, the contrary with Letterman and Conan, I miss them and watch clips of their show.
Do people in America really watch this show voluntarily? Like , watching this isn't some form of corporal punishment inforced by the penitentiary system?
the only show i subscribed since i was 15!! thank you james! my favourite host!
Harry's answer is so heartbreaking now that Liam has passed away.
😂
Now the reunion of 1D will be in Liams funeral😢
How does it work for the crew? Do they all just lose there jobs and then have to find new ones now then? Like are they hired by CBS and so just get put on another show or are they all like contracted so have to now look for new work?
this show was my childhood
He didn't end the show on his own terms. They fired his overweight self. CBS was losing money, which is why they not only didn't hire a replacement but completely ended the late late show.
Nasty affairs weekend ?
Sad this show is not on anymore !
With two weeks until the presidential election this was the perfect video to re-watch. "More similar than different". Eagna ó Shasana. 🇺🇲
damn harrys question sure hits different..
Harry styles was uncomfortable watching corden trying to keep it together
Now wea are gonna have a One Direction reunion in a funeral RIP Liam 🕊️🤍
Will there be a One Direction reunion?   Harry: I don't see why we wouldn't.   R.I.P Liam 😭😭😭
We miss you on the late late night show James Corden.
It's a shame JAMES had to finish doing the LATE LATE SHOW 😔 AT LEAST THEY COULD HAVE KEPT HIM DOINGthe CARPOOL KARAOKE 🥰🇬🇧XX LISA from the 🇬🇧
Parang its showtime
JAMES, SHOW MUST GO ON
Please spread the word to the world. Listen to J apanese artist Number_i❤
Irene's mother the real elephant
HE IS A FANTASTIC ACTOR AND CONDUCTOR, FROM CHILE WE LOVE YOU.
Thanks james!
Jeff loves tolly James a real man ❤
Absolutely amazing how these hollywood manage to stat out of prison. James i just that video of you sniffing justin beiber. Asking him how old he is. When you already knew he was 15. Sick fuck. I Hope one day you and diddy can share a jail cell.
Who is Harry's stylist?  because his colors need reassessing.
Everybody .you send in Jeff's life they get in trouble
womp womp
James Invite NewGenes  please 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭❤
one dimension  !!!!!
miss the bit where he touched bieber
I wasn’t expecting to cry tonight…
You know a show isnt funny when they feel the need to add a laugh track.
Not sure why this popped up. But, I have a funny feeling James is coming back.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I felt a strong connection with the girl who fainted as soon as Harry fist bumped her 😂❤
Dhar Mann a jack ass
You're a side chick does her thing very good oh yea
Wow. Things do happen for reason. Please take the time to read what has happened not to me but for a world that seems to be in disarray. I just read Anonymous 428 and I couldn't agree more with this Father and for me 'a openly gay guy' please understand I look for joy and harmony/decency in people. The late late show has a hidden gem. At least it must be heard by Americans. Time stamp in the last show is '32:59 to 35:00. PLEASE PLEASE take a couple of minutes out of your life and listen to what James has to say.
Blow jobs affairs
Irene's mother was the real elephant
Love the James Cordon show. This is hilarious!
Where is conon
thank you
What is Harry wearing 😂
Jeff talked to the cops they know about Mindy and Irene
~🦾⚡🏆💫💫🏆🏆⚡🦾
james* define talent  ...  harrys mind* louis: define girlfriends
Back on here to watch this last show again. I still miss James Corden. He had the best late show because he was so different.
Why did the show get taken off?
❤❤❤❤❤
😂
James still you are loved and missed I hope you and your family are doing well!!! ♥️
Hey Trump take Jeff's Italian mafia family and shove it
James corden looks like a bully.

Liberal propaganda
Dumb show
👏👏👏👏👏❤❤❤❤❤
gaikaduai family wish u the best from tml manipur
не могу избавиться от мысли что у джеймса вайб майкла скотта из офиса 😭 ну fr…..
I always really enjoyed this show! James is such a complete talent; funny actor, singer, dancer and such a comedian. I read gossip that he was disliked behind the scenes; I find that blithering hard to believe. I hope his leaving to go back to the UK was the official reason; to take his family back home. Thanks, James! It’s been a real treat! Good luck! ❤🇨🇦❤
Everybody knows about the everybody knows about the
Did your wife find out about her she will know 🎉
How's your divorce going
Whoever cancelled this show is a jerk..BIGTIME..
James Corden ,  You're Simply The Best.   So Funny.       Thanks Luv
Hey Lady Gaga we have pictures of her with the ex-russian landlord's lawyers
Nobody's going to Connecticut go to hell
😂😂😂😂
AHHHHHH DAVID LETTERMAN🎉
What an incredible speech !!!🥹🥹🥹
I wish you come back, i miss your show and your funny reactions, and your sweey gestures to your guests
Maybe, I'm one of those people who miss James's late late show the most, but I understand life is about cycles and James ended a cycle to end a new one, by the way thank you for inviting Will and Harry to this beautiful farewell.
I miss this show.
All the screaming gets on my nerves 😂
I'm pretty sad that its ending, my favourite part of this episode  is 25:34 when Harry ever so politely put down the sledge hammer
Good show, hilarious 😂
I love how harry hits the detsk with the sledge hammer and then just puts it gently on the side of the table.
Did your wife and kids find out they will there's pictures🎉
20:08❤
This a right  mother fucking stupid stunt The media is so full of dumb shit heads
When one direction come back will the late late show?!🥺
Oh that made me so emotional 😂❤even if I don't know the show well
Whomp whomp
I MISS IT N I AM CRYING BIG TIME
Why??? It was such a refreshimg approach. Kudos!

Hey Mindy you're the real fool
I am surprised there is no negative comments
por que acabou ??
Harry styles makes me sick. I used to love him. But I realized after his watermelon sugar video all he cares about is skinny. Not one person in that video was larger or heavy.He's just like the rest, all about looks and surface.
Hey Jeff's family in Florida he says drop dead
playing radiohead at the beginning was a goated choice ngl
Jeff says you and Trump can go to hell
How was your plane crash there might be another one
How was your plane crash there might be another one

Irene's deals with the president didn't work out
We know what the deal Irene and the president sorry no money
God he sucks
Did you  get the.divorce. yet?
We will miss James funny guy much talent sir
What a trash
Now the last guest has gone from the Green Room and our last conversation is done. The final rehearsal is over and the final commercial has run. No more late late Tinder for swiping no more torturous games for a laugh. No more risking my life on a fighter jet or learning too much about our staff. I’ve been squeezing myself into Spanx every night for 1200 times in a row. So goodnight. Thanks for watching, that’s our show.  Now the last karaoke’s been carpooled and we all came along for the ride. The last spill your guts has been swallowed and I’m still feeling nauseous inside. And soon I will head home to London, but I’ll sure miss it here in L.A. The weather my friends and those micro green salads I claim that I eat every day. And Reggie will no longer ask people questions that aren’t the least bit apropos. “What is the nature of time?” “Thanks buddy helpful as always.” So goodnight. Thanks for watching, that’s our show.  That’s our show the producers, directors and designers, The ones who set the lights and answer phones and do the edit, writing sketches working cameras, building graphics making costumes, booking talent, mixing sound and never getting any credit. Our show was a creation of love and dedication shared by everyone here in the crew. I’m grateful for the 8 years I spent with them and the 8 years I spent here with you.  As the end of the show fast approaches, I gaze at the studio floor. We filled it with thousands of moments of joy, but now there won’t be any more. Yet I know as I look in the camera for the very last time as your host. That each of those thousands of moments of joy is the one I’ll remember the most. And part of me thinks why not stay here forever, but deep in my heart I just know. No more shows to be showing. It’s time I was going. It’s time. Thanks for watching, that’s our show…
Why is there a laughing track every second what in the Disney channel fuck is this
the national anthem at the beginning ??
I still have the faith that this men is going to be the one who reunited 1D again ❤
How's your wife and kids doing
Bring this show back 🥹😩
I love you James Corden - one of my favourite hosts ever!! Such a lovely person. So funny. I wish you all the best with whatever you do in the future. 🌸🌸🌸
Mind your own business , the doctor given out drugs
Got me all in my tears. That part in the end where he chokes up and sings about how a part of him wishes he could stay here forever but deep down in his heart he knows it's time...Ugh...where are the tissues? Amazing with all the hosts showing up for him like that. True unity and that's America!

Brilliant final!! This is my 2nd time watching it (: I miss him! So sincere and funny and talented (:
Thx from Germany ❤
Did you all see Joe Biden -he was so young back then😂😂 -
Still d ont know why it ended ????, but loved watching him !!
What a classy showman. I enjoyed this show. he got destroyed with the covid politics, but damn he puts on a good show. The tribute from his contemporaries, the president, his parents. good showmanship. I am eager to see what is next.
Loved it 💚
Mindy the real fool.😢
Will Ferrell is so hot
I hope he starts doing movies- comedy with a character that lasts for several movies.
i’m only 14 years old and i watched these for like 5-7 years now and i really cried during the last ones. Thank you James for always putting a smile on my face as a little kid and now too. I / We will miss you! Thank you for everything️
Mindy the real fool
Beautiful 😍.
When Biden says Who is that guy? He really means it!! Lol
Great Man
It was the first speech Joe has ever done that he didn’t mess up on. What a joke of a President
Hey irene jeff says go to hell no money
Hey Irene no money 💰
Fukn can’t STAND James corden ugh
Discovered crosswalk musicals/concerts during COVID and his monologs were always my favorites of the late night shows. This show was awesome and is sorely missed.
We know what you did James. And years from now the whole world will know
TMI😮

Everybody knows about the sex.with Irene
Irene Wiley nasty sex with prolly.
Thank you for this incredible 8 years❤️
Hey Irene Billy and his drugs cop knows
Jammmeesssss you could’ve waited 3 extra years to retire your show! I wanted to be a guest!! 😂 one day, I will be loved enough to tell my story and play games on a talk show, I wanted one segment with you! Your energy is beyond great and Spill your guts or fill your guts game was a banger. Great show forever!
I wish that everybody of the crew found a new job in a company with good qualities.
I'll tell Mindy no no no😮
My life is a mess. I am fighting to survive. You are a Millionaire but I am not jealous. What really counts in life is sensitivity, emphasis, humor, help, rescue, solidarity, heart, brain...... This is here a good example.
Rolly wonderful in bed 🎉
Very poor last show. Franklin, lazy.
❤❤❤ Thank you so much for being you...I will miss you. Xoxo from Toronto Canada

Hey Mindy and family jeff says go to hell
It was about time, this really boring guy destroyed "Cats".
I miss this show.
Hi everybody  I know  it's too late to see this show (late  late show ) I wish and I hope  Mr James all best  with my love 💓  Greetings Ozz from Syria
Came for the tears.  Because of all the joyous years. 🥲
Prolly my kind of woman smart and sexy🎉
I can't believe it's been almost one year since James Corden left us late late-nighters.  I worked the late shift at an international airport for a major airline in the baggage service office,  so James was my therapist between late flights, missing baggage, and yes extremely unhappy people for good reasons.  James provided the balm of laughter for tears, and the pure joy of just being alive and making it through another day.  Thank you, James, I miss our times together, me on the couch and you boxed in that  1990's TV set in our break room.  One night when flights were really late we decided to have some "James Corden" fun and created our own "baggage carousel karaoke and musical".  It was a blast, so much fun, you would have loved it, wished we had filmed our "musical escapade"  but we feared for our jobs if the video ever went viral.  Late-night television has never been the same since you signed off and with the 2024 presidential election, we need you more than ever!!!
Me and her is not breaking up.go to hell
All six guys are awesome 👍♥️🙏✝️✌️😎
That mindy the real fool
Started Watching this show during quarantine. Best late night  ever when his show was still airing. James will be missed.
wow the last epi
Love this guy, bright future for you James!
❤
What does James Corden do now?
US Late night shows aren't that fad in the Philippines but I fell in love the moment I watched the 1st episode of James'..and 8 yrs came so fast? Thank you James for bringing joy across the globe..😊
anonymous428 , i cant belive i havent seen this before, i saw carpool kareoke in liverpool (where i am) paul mcartney rocked it, as for "james cordon" ive watched loads of late late shows, chris evans was one of the best then julian cleary came along and i pissed myself many a time , sir you are a genius and i promise im going to sit and watch the entire 8 years of shows,only my kids make me cry these days but you have given my eyeballs a good wash tonight sitting watching show after show , the staircase sketch was aawesome well done and i look forward to seeing what you do next, final word la is much nicer than london give ya head a wobble , love from liverpool namaste alan.
If it wasnt for James, I would have never become a fan of One Direction. (SHHHHHH thats a secret! Lol) And then Harry Styles! 😍
Out of ALL the late night shows in this crazy crazy world, his was the best! (I can't  STAND Kimmel! He's a drama queen! Lol. USED to love Steven Corbet too, but he's a drama queen too!)
Hey doctor they know about your drugx.go to hell
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Why is this his last show funny guy!!
Did anyone see that girl pass out
Rip
I remember James Corden's first show; time has passed so quickly. When I first saw him, I questioned whether this guy would really be successful. But before long, I realized that I had been watching all of his programs without missing any. I want to thank James Corden, the music group, the writers, and everyone working behind the scenes for bringing this entertaining and wonderful program to us. Thank you all for sharing this delightful and beautiful program with us. I hope life continues to offer you positive and beautiful stories. With love from Turkey. I apologize if my English is not perfect; it's not my native language, but I couldn't resist expressing myself without writing a comment.Seni Seviyoruz James !
I'm so glad everybody's out of my life go to hell
🧔1 John 5 to 10. And this is the message🔉 which we heard from him and 🔊proclaim to you: that God is light,🌟 and in him there is no darkness🌑 at all. 6 If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth. 7 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanses us from all sin. 8 If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. 9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. 10 If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.
This guy is an ass
I think the BEST Carpool Karaoke was with USHER !!! They even helped push a car off the street !!  GREAT SHOW !! ( I LOVE USHER ❤)
James, your show was the Best Late Late show ever! You're better than all the earlier late shows combined & I anticipated you coming out of that curtain and I started laughing and didn't stop  until the
THANK YOU SO MUCH !!!!!!!! AND JAMES  !!!!!!!! YOU ARE MOST AWESOME !!!!!!!! : )
May I ask why it ends? This is an amazing show.  😂😅
Just bring back Craig...
We miss you James ♥ I hope you guys are doing great!
HO is pretty good scale!
I literally died when he was getting ready to introduce the video that Biden made for him and he said “this next person has relied on our show for the news for atleast the last 3 to 4 years” lmfaooo I’m so sad to see this show go Corden was truly one of the greats … good luck to you buddy so happy for you being able to follow your heart and go where your truly happy to be with your family…. Can’t wait to see what’s next for you !!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I don't want Mindy pig

I know you're games with Mindy. Sorry it's not going to work.🎉🎉
James Cordon ❤ 😍 🤩 🥳 👍 👌.From Norway.
The final episode of the late late show after almost 30 years!
The reason I came here was beacuse of the question being asked to Harry about one direction but got to know that this was last one.
Why is none talking about the 1D question tho I got so sad watching this for the first time
Narcissist.. Forced to close the show... What happens in the dark will always come to light.
😭 I wish you were back James 😭
We love rolly did you get your divorce.
Use a pen and paper 😊
Hey irene we don't give a crap about family

Hey Jeff's family jeff filed.a lawsuit against you.nasty. people
He didn’t quit.  The bad press of abusive behavior caught up to him.  He’s not working much today.
Health department for doctors
It's been eight months already, and I still can't believe it sincerely. It's been an amazing journey with you James, thank you for making us laugh, cry, etc. I'll always be grateful for all these karpool karaokes, that will always be something that I'll look up to cheer me up when I'm sad. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
GLAD IT'S OVER. GOOD RIDDANCE
Oh what a nasty affair  everybody knows
23:27 We all really hope there will be One direction reunion really soon .... It was not just a boy band but an emotion which each and every teen experienced in their life...... There songs were like a medicine to each and every cure.. ❤❤❤😊😊😊😊If One direction was still there i bet that they would have be one of the best bands till date.... Thanks for making our youth more joyfull and memorable😊😊❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤Hope to see 1D soon..............
You are an absolute doll..❤ty love sage travels😢
Yes it is finally over for how rude you were to the cast well deserved @TheLateLateShow
By the time this show came out I was just 16 years old. It seems like forever ago my god time goes by too fast
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Tongetha ❤😂
Simulcast on pinoyhits
She's still my girlfriend get a divorce
I miss the drive alongs, they were the best, so fun!
Thank fuck
He should stay and the rest should go.
Not harry kissing that bald guys head
Alright UK , get ready he's coming home! Sorry!  I used to think he was funny like Ellen, until he started getting exposed for all the nasty things he was doing so they're basically the same thing. I don't know how everybody else feels but I'm glad he's going back.  He claims that he didn't sign a new contract with CVS because he wanted to be with his children and his family but I think it has something to do with the fact that he has such a bad reputation here . My God, he needs to humble himself. Good luck to James, I hope you find  true happiness , and find some self awareness..
Love you gang!!! Thanks for sharing your beautiful selves with the world! Blessings on the journey ahead!
All i imagine when i hear him talk is Biggie from Trolls🫶🏽🥹
I FINALLY made myself watch this. Ive refused for all this time! And this is why DAMN IT! HIS final sign off fuckin killed me!
Good riddance man, didnt like James one bit. After Conan left, late night shows died with all the greats before.
Nice
I would love to see a movie with Will Fallon as ELF, mentoring Harry and James as up and coming Elves.🌲🎅
Boring sports on her radio show is Gordon there ?
Really wish his show was still on. Out of all the late shows this use to be my favorite.
thank god this show is over.
Thank you James for the great 8 years.. all the wonderfull and amazing personalities coming on your show . McCartney Paul and you  Karaoke's . Something to remember. Good luck ! In whatever you are focusing on doing in your next future.
❤ James  😢 !& 🎉 Covid was ok because, James Cordin, I had you.
Love him ❤
Obviously Harry Styles has no talent. He was in the right place at the right time. How did he become famous and Leona Lewis not?
God Im gonna miss this show so much, thank you to the crew and everyone possible for making such enjoyable episodes. Really has helped bring a smile on my face
How is Mindy's doctor Arthur doing ? I hear he has a nice wife and beautiful kids 😮😅 Mindy is a sick puppy 😮😮😮
What the mes
Poor guy, this whole show was an attempt to make him cry and him respectfully trying not to.
I miss James Corden his show was fantastic 💜
☺️☺️☺️
I love Marjorie Taylor green 😂
So sad 😢😢😢 good luck James. We will never have someone like you
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😂❤ love you 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😅😅😅😅😊😊😊😊😅😅😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
James Always a delight every night. I thank You. Much Love to Your family. Youre welcome back Anytime .tl So Cal. Mmwhaaah!
Miss you James 😢
Mindy the real fool I will never kiss her rotten butt 😮😮😮
I don't want James to leave :( I love him so much
Poop.
Harry... 20:48
Glad that's over.
<3
That was Classy! Well done. 🥂🍾
It was amazing, thank you James!!❤
I'm sorry you're a Leo and I'm a Leo that's probably why we don't get maybe we think the same way
i will spend pardoning time answering questions
its just so funny that it is now im fond of watching James corden show, the last time was the final carpool with Adele, that is smashing performance inside the car, and i drove around Philippines I still have that vibe to do it…thank you so much…so whats in it now after the Late late show? cant wait what you gotta do next!❤
Love James,  he's so funny ! And I personally think he's a great performer and he can sing well !!!
Why is this the last ever episode? Did Corden retire from being a late night TV show host after this?
As soon as the other talk show hosts came on I lost it
❤️❤️
See ya
15:27 Closedown
You’re so MISSED
It amazes me how people could be in anyway entertained by a talentless hack and  simp like Corden, , and even us Brits dont think he's funny. We dont want him back.
I did file a lawsuit against Roseanne and Anthony and family I have the last laugh
So happy that this idiot has stopped, what a relief! Craig Ferguson was 1000 times better
16:52
still sad that there wasnt a 1d reunion😢

They are filthy leftist millionaires badmouthing Trump.

Good riddance
A reliable friend in “the know” recently told me some shocking news.  Was told James Corden—when not in front of a camera—is a complete *hole.  I hope this is not true because I too enjoyed his show.  Please tell me this is not true.  If it is, tell it to me straight.  I can take it.  If it is true, please no more *holes! The day to day world has enough of them.  We turn to TV, to shows like this for comic relief from the realities of the world, a break from people who cause others grief.  If James Corden is the kind of person I hope he’s not, I hope the next night show host is a good person.
15:27
12:28 - 16:54
I still havent gotten over the fact that Will Ferrell sang a Harry Styles song and on top of that it was in front of Harry Styles.
harry didnt want to be there
I feel like this is a good relationship he had with TV. Restricted. And dumb mistakes.

I loved him as a host
Memories are the treasure of our heart, written in our mind's !! Tanx to give as that memories ❤
I can’t stand him
soooo who wanted him out do a puzzle
Love Harry! He made me tear up
Bring him back. He deserves to hold this spot till he cannot anymore. his showmanship is on point and the way he interacts  with his guests is perfect. He is a perfect late show host, up there with Johnny Carson .
29:25-31:08
I need a whole spin off show of James Corden hosting in the stairwell
Where’s the one from trump??? 😂😂😂😂
If James is leaving the tv is cause raught things are going to comeeee !! 😢
Everytime I see James Corden I think about my time back to when I was living in High Wycombe as a US Air Force 'brat'! Great memories! (English Mum American Dad)

Good riddance scum
A class act!!!
Does believe any word Trump says.
Sad he the very best of late night
I saw Trevor the world ❤❤❤❤❤
Miss James every single week😢night!  He was a wonderful host in every way possible.

We hate family

Los Vegas blow jobs
....will miss you James!
Papa Mochi out, Peace🥺
Thank God the nightmare has ended!
The last song really did need Cowbells.  And Will Ferrell could have fulfilled that need.  But, he did not.  Also, now this shows entire staff is without a job.  Corden's table was jackhammered to shreds and car karaoke 🎤 was brought to an abrupt end.  Also, James mum could no longer come to L.A. for Botox.  Adele will now miss her mate James.  I don't know what's worse.  This show ending or COVID.
So cringe - he had them all toast him as he went on stage. Where all humanity exists as a non-divided species? Los Angeles? Are you joking? because they are all woke there? The last Late Late show in CBS history? Pretty sure Craig Ferguson had a FAR superior version for 10 years, not to mention Tom Snyder's run and Craig Kilbourne. Of course they got Joke Biden to do a bit. Liberal crap. Thank god this dbag is off the air.
I've never actually watched the show before. Well, that's a lie.... right before this I watched carpool karaoke for Harry. But yes this has me in tears.
Ya lost me when Grandpa Joe came on…
James , you made me smile, laugh and cry.. Thankyou...now fuck off   lol
How long has he been doing the show now ?
I beg you to invite my idols Harry styles and one direction to this event. I request an Indonesian translation. I don't really understand English
This was another hard blow just 12 hours before this episode aired legendary, daytime, talk show host Jerry Springer passed away.😭😭😭
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN JAMES CORDEN HAS LEFT THE BUILDING!👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Thank you James Corden for being exactly yourself. I thoroughly enjoyed watching you all the time. You will be missed!!

As the end of the show fast approaches  I gaze at the studio floor  We filled it with thousands of moments of joy  And now there won't be any more  Yet I know as I look in the camera  For the very last time as your host  That each of those thousands of moments of joy  Is the one I'll remember the most  Part of me thinks Why not stay here forever?  But deep in my heart I just know  It's time I was going It's time Thanks for watching That's our show
Never liked you and you can never replace Craig Ferguson. Good Riddance!
James I am so disappointed in you, you didn’t get all the boys together in your final show. 🙁
Tony winner turned carpool karaoke late show GOAT cheers king to you, the family, the staff, styles, will, the BAND, and fans on a special 8 year run 👑🥂🇬🇧 🙏, and that assembled group of late night goats in James master bedroom with kemmel, letterman, Fallon, Meyers, Colbert was endgame avengers level 😂😂😂 🔥
All I can say is, “Wow!”  Thank you, James. Thank you
Thank you james for bringing so much joy in our lives x
I spoke with this sister tonight between maghrib and isha prayer (about an hour)  We spoke about Allah (The God) The One who has no beginning and no end.  The One who has full knowledge of everything that happens before it happens.  The One that is neither limited by time nor space, and to whom nothing is hidden.  The One whose vision encompasses all whilst no vision can encompass Him.  The One who can hear all and knows our deepest thoughts.  The One who flattened the earth and made it liveable for His creation.  The One who brings rain from the clouds and revives the dead land after its death.  The One who created man from dust, then from a drop of semen, and nurtured the foetus in the womb.  The One who gives life and death.  The One who over centuries revealed to mankind different miracles, inviting them to know Him and believe in Him.  The One who sent messengers to each nation and revealed scriptures to them, and sent Muhammad as the final Messenger and the Qur’an as the final scripture.  The One who created this life as a test and the afterlife as an eternal abode.  The One who guides whomsoever He wills and lets go astray whomsoever He wills.  Does it make sense, that  God has created us, then God will not make it clear what God wants from us?  We as muslims believe that GOD (Allah) has sent messengers and books down to mankind so that we may know who God is, and how to worship God.  God has made it clear to us that this life is a test, and the ones who worship God and do good deeds, God will reward them with paradise.  And those who turn away from God and refuse to worship God, then God will account them for rejecting the truth.  Our purpose of life in this world is to worship GOD (Allah) alone without associating any partner(s) with HIM, and to pass the tests He gives, and to work towards earning a place in eternal Paradise. By recognizing the meaning of life, our relationship with GOD (Allah) strengthens, and peace and tranquility increases in our lives.   I told her that Allah has been sending messengers and books since the beginning of time so that mankind may know Him and worship Him alone so everytime a nation began to leave or distort what the past messenger or prophet came with, Allah commissioned another prophet or messenger to call the people to believe in his message and everything that he came with and he explained to us that disbelief in him is disbelief in the one who sent him (Allah).    Allah has commissioned the final prophet and messenger for all of mankind; Muhammad may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him after the distortion of his religion and his prior books.   So us as Muslims believe in all of the prior prophets and messengers and all of the prior books as Allah has commanded.  and I explained to her that Islam is just the Arabic word for the same religion that was given to the first man, Adam. It simply means in English: "To submit your will to God's will."   Therefore, Islam is not a new religion, rather it is the same message preached by all earlier prophets such as Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus (peace be upon them all).   However, God’s final message to mankind was revealed to the final messenger Muhammad, as a revival of the lost teachings of previous prophets and as a reconfirmation of the eternal message, and that message is: To worship and believe in the 1 true God - Almighty (Allah) with no partner(s).  She asked me : are all the religions accepted by God!? I told her that islam is the only religion accepted by God and   No one will enter the heaven unless he believes in all the true messengers:-  During the time of Prophet Noah no one will enter the heaven or be true believer unless he believes in Noah  During the time of Prophet Abraham no one will enter the heaven or be a true believer unless he believes in Abraham and all the messengers before him  During the time of Prophet Moses no one will enter the heaven or be a true believer unless he believes in Moses and all the messengers before him  During the time of Prophet Jesus no one will enter the heaven or be a true believer unless he believes in Jesus and all the messengers before him  During the time of Prophet Muhammad  no one will enter the heaven or be a true believer unless he believes in Muhammad and all the messengers before him.  To be A true believer you must believe in all the messengers whom God has sent  God has mentioned in the holy Quran that who ever refuse to believe in any true messenger he will refuse him: read the following verse:  she opened the translation and read the verse from the Holy Quran:  "Indeed, those who disbelieve in Allāh and His messengers and wish to discriminate between Allāh and His messengers and say, "We believe in some and disbelieve in others," and wish to adopt a way in between -  Those are the disbelievers, truly. And We have prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment".  The last message from God Allah has been sent down to mankind and it is obligatory upon every individual who understands Islam and hears about the last prophet Mohammad, to believe and worship God in a way that He is pleased with; by worshiping him by himself, praying 5 times a day, fasting the month of Ramadan, staying away from fornication and so on.    So whoever here’s about this last message and rejects it then God will reject him.      I told her that Muslims must believe, love and respect Jesus and his message of worshiping God (Allah) alone without any partner   We believe that he was one of the mightiest Messengers of God (Allah) the almighty God (Allah). We believe that he was born miraculously, without any male intervention. We believe he was the Messiah translated Christ (peace be upon him).   We believe that he was NOT God, NOR the son of God NOR was he crucified.   In Islam, it is compulsory to believe in Jesus Chirst, we love  prophet Jesus, but we believe that prophet Jesus and prophet Muhammad (peace be upon them both ) are prophets, They were revealed to guide us to the path of God and path of paradise, path of love and path of peace.  The greatest benefit of being a Muslim is that a Muslim is promised by God the reward of eternal Paradise (Heaven).    Hell  is the abode in which the God  Allah  has  prepared for  those who do  not believe  in  Him,  those who rebel against His laws and disbelieve in His Messengers.  It is the punishment  for  His enemies, the prison  for evildoers.  Then I said to her: "Let me say this to you: “This life is  short as a dream ..no one knows when he will die! What will be your answer to your creator if  he ask you in the judgment day: Why didn’t you pursue the truth? Why didn’t you believe in the last messenger?”  The God (Allah ) explains to us in the Quran that many people will turn away from his religion because they hold on to what their forefathers are upon.    Allah explains to us that these such people have no excuse with him.   Then I asked her: So if that all makes sense to you, and you have recognized the truth in your heart.  Then you must take first step towards becoming a Muslim.   Don't let your past hold you back from doing the right thing.  Become a true believer today!  Then she decided to accept islam!  https://www.facebook.com/hayan.yafae?mibextid=ZbWKwL
#Jesus  was the way, the truth and the life?  Every prophet is the way to God in his time. Abrahim and Noah were the way to their people in their time.  If you say only jesus.  So Noah and Abrahim went to hell  Because  there was no jesus in their time.  John 14:6 said Jesus said he was the way, the truth and the life.  The way is the means towards reaching your goal, target and destination.The goal, target and destination in this context is God.  If Jesus was the way to God, does that make him God?Is God the way too?If you say, God is the way too, then the way to where?  If you believe in Jesus is the truth , the life and the way  , you should know that he isn't god but he's prophet alone ,  Bible says that Jesus Recognized, Prayed, & Worshipped the Only True God  Jesus prayed to God with the words: John 17:3 “…that they might know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent.”  Jesus prayed to God all night: Luke 6:12 “he continued all night in prayer to God.”  How did Jesus pray to God?  Matthew 26:39 ‘…he fell with his face to the ground and prayed, ‘My Father…”  Even Paul said: Hebrews 5:7 “During the days of Jesus' life on earth, he offered up prayers and petitions with loud cries and tears to the one who could save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverent submission.”  Who was Jesus praying to when he fell on his face with loud cries and petitions?Was it himself?Was Jesus crying in tears to himself pleading to be saved from death?No man, sane or insane, prays to himself!Surely the answer must be a resounding ‘No.’ Jesus was praying to “the only true God.” Jesus was the servant of the One Who sent him.Can there be a clearer proof that Jesus was not God?  The Quran confirms that Jesus called for the worship of the Only True God:  “Truly, God is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him (alone).This is the straight path.” (Quran 3:51)  No one will enter the heaven unless he believes in all the true messengers:-  During the time of Prophet Noah no one will enter the heaven or be true believer unless he believes in Noah  During the time of Prophet Abraham no one will enter the heaven or be a true believer unless he believes in Abraham and all the messengers before him  During the time of Prophet Moses no one will enter the heaven or be a true believer unless he believes in Moses and all the messengers before him  During the time of Prophet Jesus no one will enter the heaven or be a true believer unless he believes in Jesus and all the messengers before him  During the time of Prophet Mohammed  no one will enter the heaven or be a true believer unless he believes in Mohammed and all the messengers before him.  To be A true believer you must believe in all the messengers whom God has sent  God has mentioned in the holy Quran that who ever refuse to believe in any true messenger he will refuse him: read the following verse:   "Indeed, those who disbelieve in Allāh and His messengers and wish to discriminate between Allāh and His messengers and say, "We believe in some and disbelieve in others," and wish to adopt a way in between -  Those are the disbelievers, truly. And We have prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment".  So Islam is just the Arabic word for the same religion that was  given to the first man, Adam. It simply means in English: "To submit your will to God's will."   Therefore, Islam is not a new religion, rather it is the same message preached by all earlier prophets such as Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus (peace be upon them all).   However, God’s final message to mankind was revealed to the final messenger Muhammad, as a revival of the lost teachings of previous prophets and as a reconfirmation of the eternal message, and that message is: To worship and believe in the 1 true God - Almighty (Allah) with no partner(s).  Allah has been sending messengers and books  since the beginning of time so that mankind may know Him and worship Him alone so everytime a nation began to leave or distort what the past messenger or prophet came with, Allah commissioned another prophet or messenger to call the people to believe in his message and everything that he came with and he explained to us that disbelief in him is disbelief in the one who sent him (Allah).    Allah has commissioned the final prophet and messenger for all of mankind; Muhammad may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him after the distortion of his religion and his prior books.   So us as Muslims believe in all of the prior prophets and messengers and all of the prior books as Allah has commanded.  We believe in the book ( gospel  )which God has revealed to the prophet Jesus  But The bible had been changed greatly over time. That doesn't mean it's completely destroyed or altered 100% . There are still some verses that are consistent with the true message of Jesus and moses which is the oneness of God.  The greatest evidence for the distortion of the Bible is the existence oindifferent versions ofntof the Bible, while the Qur’an is preserved, as God revealed it, and the reason is that God promised to protect it from increase and decrease  In Islam, it is compulsory to believe in Jesus Chirst, we love  prophet Jesus, but we believe that prophet Jesus and prophet Muhammad (peace be upon them both ) are prophets,. They were revealed to guide us to the path of the God and path of paradise, path of love and path of peace,  Christianism is not the religion of beloved jesus christ, jesus was on the monothesim , the oneness of the almyghty God, that is Islam , so if you really love and want follow Jesus , then it is possiable in Islam only .  The last message from God Allah has been sent down to mankind and it is obligatory upon every individual who understands Islam and hears about the last prophet Muhammad , to believe and worship God in a way that He is pleased with; by worshiping him by himself, praying 5 times a day, fasting the month of Ramadan, staying away from fornication and so on.    So whoever here’s about this last message and rejects it then God will reject him.
Is it accepted logically that the Lord of the Whole world sleep? Then who takes care of the heavens and earth when he sleeps ??? Who manages the affairs of the heavens and earth?  Is it accepted logically that God who created the whole world needs food and drink? Then how will He discharge the filthy things?   Is it accepted logically that God who is perfect needs to sleep, to eat, to drink etc.  The True God doesn’t need anything or anyone. If He needs food, drink and sleep then He is weak.  Is your God weak?  Is it accepted logically that a God who gives life and causes death to die? Then who took His soul? And if He dies, what will happen to earth and all creation on the earth? To whom they resort if God dies? To Whom they call and invoke for their needs ?
He was a brillant, creative and verycfunny host. It's a pitty, that it ends now.🥹
I wonder if those employees were paid extra to act happy

Luding
You do realize that it was James dad that Harry kissed on the head in the audience? Why are we not talking about this?
I have never watched The late late show, I do not know anything about it except for the short videos here on YT. I came to this video led by some Harry Styles interview. But I saw the whole video of the last show. And I am crying with all these people I am not familiar with; I can feel their emotions and I am grateful for that. Whoever you are, where ever you are now, you made my day wonderful people!
Nice. All the best.
James WE MISS YOU!!!! 😢❤
This show was something I would look forward to and this being the last episode makes me so sad, but all I can say is thank you for being there for me when I needed it the most! Now I will continue watching every single video and continue laughing at everything you guys created! And one day I will share this with my kids!! P.S my boyfriend absolutely loves the one you did with McLaren 😂
Why didn't he spit on that war criminal.

Bye bye James—you won’t be missed. Don’t let the door hit your fat ass on the way out.
They should have asked Trump to do a clip. We may all have been up for a surprise! He may well have delivered a humble, funny and polite farewell. Naah 😂
I had no idea :( love u James 💓
バイデン大統領、早く退陣してください。世界が終わる😢
13:19
I only got to see the carpool Karaoke just a few ; I’ve never saw late late show ; I’m sure it was fabulous ; I had to work; sorry your leaving your job I’ve heard a lot about how fabulous it was . Good Luck 🍀 on your next journey
The One Direction renion!! :)
Did somone else noticed the girl that fainted when she fist bump Harry?
Doctor got fired
So gay I had to turn it off.
TT..
Everything good comes to an end 😢😢
Wow. What a way to finish 👏🏾👏🏾
I still can't  believe  it's over.  I want you back.
You will be missed!
Did the woman who fist bumped Harry Styles at 17:50 fall? xd
The talk host bit was missing Conan... Even though his talk show ended too 🤣
No worries for irene.jeff.lied.on his case
Funny on camera, but a complete wanker off it.
Get the divorce I'm out.of hear
did she just faint after getting a fist bump from harry 💀would be me
Did that girl legitimately pass out after Harry fist bumped her? XD Edit: Okay nvm she was good for Will lol
Having Harry as last guest is the realest thing I’ve ever seen. We all know it’s not just because Harry is super famous atm but they’ve been friends for a really long time now.  It’s even better seeing James attending in Harry’s final Love on Tour show in Italy last Saturday.  Pretty sure both of them were equally proud of what they’ve archived the last years and I’m pretty sure we will see them both again.   Thanks James.
You can invite Mr. Beast
Good riddance.
Dude I just love your show everybody is gonna miss you if i'm gonna say anything more than that then i'll sound like a Gay  but i'm gonna miss you buddy stay blessed.
❤❤❤
You made my life better by filling it with so many emotional moments and I want to thank you for that. I don´t know if all the rumors about you are true because I don´t know you personally and if they are true go f.. yourself but if they are not then don´t care about haters and don´t let them get to you.  Your show was funny and emotional to watch over the years and carpool karaoke has had so many wonderful moments of joy and tears, I will miss it and I wish you all the best. Greetings from Austria and in case I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening and goodnight.
Shot in the but and your too late you give oysters a bad name

Dude after rewatching this I just noticed the lad fell down after Harry's fist bomb 17:50.
Because he's coming home, are us Brits finally going to find out if he said Yes or not to OUR Nessa!?
Self entitled dummy.
who's Harry?  haha
This is legit making me anxious 😂
I love James’s ironiy 😂 and like him to receive the people with love❤
Okay, U.K., we've loved James' incredible talent and creativity for eight years. He wants to go home and has a great deal too offer. So, don't treat him like shit.
Jeff's family.drop dead
Even toasted by the walking corpse of Joe Biden. Wow
"And that's the way it is."
20:37 I just watched tattoo roulette before this and this part almost made me cry. Everything started flowing back. Also when Harry was showing the tattoo he was flipping us off 😂🥲
I'll miss your fabulous sense of humor on Late Late and look forward to seeing you next gig!
25:27 me next 🙏🏼
I just post that Andy Serkis should play Terence McKenna in a movie but if it were to be a complete comedy perhaps Will Ferrell could play part. Maybe a serious movie would be more of a respectful tribute or homage vs a parody by the comedy genius that is Ferrell
Amazing, 40 minutes long and not a single second of comedy
did no one notice when he fist pumped the girl when harry came out she fainted straight after
8 great years plenty of good moments to remember. Thanks a lot😊
Do they know about your affair?Do they know about your affair?
Great run James and team, best of luck to whatever you guys do next. I may have not watched every episode throughout the years but i really truly enjoyed some of your segments (and not just carpool). Take a break and spill your guts made me laugh when i really needed it the most.  Ps. I just love how Will and Harry both took the time to say hello to your parents.  I wish you and family all the best James.
It’s great to see Harry as one of the last guest considering after all the stuff they have done threw the years I feel like they should’ve brought the whole one d for it aswell
Last will haha
Im watching the last song ... i may vomit.
Thate fake applause and laughter. What a joke 😂😂
This show has made my day every single time I have watched this show and I love him so so so much he has changed my life I hope he finds joy with the rest of his life I’m crying writing this but it’s worth it
What can i say more. Love you, James, and love you all. You've changed people's lives, also mine. Thank you, and take care of yourself❤️ ❤️ Hope we'll meet one day so I can say it to you in person. That show was really incredible
Oficially heartbrokened
This man's heart is so big. <3
Am I the only one who notices the girl passing out after she did a "box" with Harry? haha
I can't imagine how hard it was for James to do this show. It's also hard for me to see it end. Good luck and lots of love. Crying...!
This was not a show, this was a happy but eyes filling ending of a movie. We'll miss you james.
The last episode should've had likes equals to the views.
Harry Styles sooo has Jesus complex, lol.
did anyone else see that girl faint when she fist bumped harry hahaha
20:09
this is amazing
i love your show. NOOOOOOOOO!!! THIS IS SO SAD!! :(
Why didn't the show end
James gordon acting like he's not a douche bag lol
For 8 years straight this show has brought me nothing but joy I will forever miss it😢
I loved this guy!! He actually made me crack up!!!
Bro spoiled the whole masked singer season for me
I’m. Only 15 but I started watching like 3-4 years ago when I started liking one direction and I found both of those thing in the worst times of my life and they have truly put a smile on my face every time so thank you James we will miss and love you ❤❤
All the best James! Thank you for the memories ❤.
Will Ferrell goated for destroying that fuckass desk
35:23 You nearly got me emotional at the end😢❤❤❤!
No Tom Cruise?
James we are so proud of your success of bring happiness to all of us here in America, and we will miss you as much as you miss us, we will be with in your heart every step of the way. We love you James❤️, and good luck with what you do next!
Why all of the love?  He treats family, coworkers and most people like garbage. He is a leftist propaganda promoter and overall bad person.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Buh bye
you know so well that if harry had ignored that fat lady in the beginning people will blow out their minds and call him fatphobic 😭
thank god this show is over, never liked this bloke, he seemed like a real a-hole.  just completely unlikeable and worst of all that phony progressive type,  good riddance.
Your go, new stop
Sale my house down 7
On thing that actually put me off will Ferrell ALOY, was it comment about England. Wasn’t necessary, no reason, why did he slag us off, Harry styles wasn’t happy either. What has England got to be mentioned in a phrase” when he is just cunting s off?  What’s been wrong when he’s been here?  Satin that on your show, is USA dissimilar England…, what the fuck have we  done to warrant that title. to him??? That wasn’t cool at all,was there , he know we’re English yeah, Harry had to sit and hear him cunting England off, cos he could, Harry didn’t look happy. Sad way to end it. And without him apologising or saying it was a joke. The comment wa unnecessary in the convo you had as well, it seemed he just has to get in a slagging off comment about England… unless I missed something.  I have gone off him now just from that one comment about England.  Patrtism don’t let you accept certain things dkrs it!  Gutted cos it just want even necessary didn’t even need to mention is y’know?.
Sorry, had to stop before you think I’m a terrorist. I’m not , I’m spurs fan, and listening to hiw she used to speak about going down, made me like her, her accent, she was a role model I thought. She’d be great. Then she went? She didn’t sing atthe new ground, champions league final, things you know as West Ham, are things yiyd give your tight tit I could do somwrhing for my fucking football tblub. Y’know, the blokes who did a few for us…. Died the year whl closed… Chas and Dave… massive they were… but nope she didn’t even as. You think how her just doing that, 15 20 minutes, singing spurs songs, the difference that would have made to players and fans. Cos shel looking like a liar, don’t ask about scores or anything Bosc, tables, nothing. I’m gutted. Has she chainedcos Americans suddenly made her think ‘she’d made it’ didn’t need us real supporters of fans bow… y’know?   But when I watched your karaokes, I was so fucking happy.  Tget rmweee they were really the only bits I watched, cos I found see you loved them, you were in awe and respected every on of them. That’s James cordon for me, mpitd, respect, unassuming, you’re not arrogant when you speak to anytime to anyone, your E proper researched them and you want this to be an interview you watch with grandkids for ever so I will do.  I could see the respect the admiration and the appreciation that they were en say there. You were worried in a few cos you thought they was t enjoying it, but you Judy needed to get out the car, be James - awAt from cameras, then it worked.  Th Adele wants were always good but even watching those bad one after another…. She’s changed a lot. Remember Bet  when she hated getting on stage…?  Ihad tried her every concert for tickets and this time I had got them. Phone for house had paid off. Lasts at to buy them, I was preparing myself to be disappointed. It would be her last date in uk and I said it’ll Roth be dad, amazing being her last one, or won’t happen. I knew people only applied this year got tickets straight away.  I finally got tickets for her last day. I sought care where they were because I know she did t like dancing, but I was going to hear her. I was going to hear that voice live, after all these years I’d be there singing them when she got upset ti help her and let her know, we’ve got her back! We’ll carry her through those so gaif she needs wrest!  I don’t even know if she has dates planned coming over here again mate and do you know what I’m gutted. It’s like the whol thing I imagined her to be in my head, I am seeing she is like that. I’ve had some bad stuff lately, lost my mum dad has done Something, we’ll just kinda disowned me I think and I have no idea why. How can a dad do that to this youngest daughter when she has lost her mum. I’m thinking maybe I’m the not right and always seen people totally wrong now, like looking back through my whole life. I don’t want Adele to prove me wrong and me … a fake American… why would sh do that? I have never understood people who suddenly hate their county and leave.  Oh on my another note. Tell Harry thank you please. His anger and wanting To know will Ferrell was definitely noted because I heard his comment andi was as fucked off as I think Harry was hearing someon Cunt our country off like that. He was actually but I think he was biting his tongue. -and to be fair, why the fuck did well feel he had to say that. What have we done to him… it wasn’t funny, certainly made me think oh he likes to Cunt Off England then then does he went he gets the opportunity… what have we done to him…?  No wonder he’s never became a BIG SUCCESS for someone as funny as him, obviously don’t know when to shut the fuck up cos unlike him and he has started something and how I will give a shit helping him in the future when he think they’re an amazing company and they helped James leaving a shift hole like England they saved him…. The cheeky Cunt whose life he is hoping I will keep alive.  But, I’m pisses if at the no, and need to try and leave this anger somewhere else Lee I don’t want it getting in the way.  I thing it’s tune everyone knows everything tonight tho, we tell each other what they think of us, see I’d they dare deny it, then watch them ask nicely if i can still see my mission through or will it be clouded…  To which I’ll say… first I would like to know which of your your relationships are fuckddotted I think that’s wants m Fred I know first and see who we have to change things atated who also seem to be unties king down when they sing their anthem..
even though i'm neither from america nor from the uk you have been a great addition to the show and you are a wonderful person. i have always enjoyed watching your carpool karaoke videos and i hope you'll have a wonderful life with your family wherever your road may lead to.
Thank you for the fun, James!
end of an era
james was always amazing...best of luck
Good riddance.
Oh Harry SAY ONE DIRECTION WILL GET A REUNION!!😡😡
Thank goodness he’s leaving
So back to england bro?
Bloody hell. You'll be missed 😮
Will not be missed
Why would they end the show as opposed to just changing the host
35:25

That was amazing......can't believe Biden strung a sentence together 👏
I cry a lot
So why did he leave?
I’d like to see more people of color, please.
THERE IS NO WAY THIS WAS A MONTH AGO
I'm sorry good luck with what you do
James Corden is such an unfunny, annoying zero .... just like the other unfunny losers
Ok, well, all's well that ends well. The book has closed. 😊
So, did he denounce Amber Heard, and publicly apologise to Johnny Depp, or did he forget that part?
My grandma is in an nursing home. I visit her as much as I can. She would watch the channel this would play on everyday. Today I was with her and she was watching the show before this and then the late late show turned on. When she heard it was the last time she started crying. I asked her why she saw crying and she said “Because this is the last time I’ll turn this off.” She sat up and got the remote and at 78 years old and turned off the TV. Thank you for bringing my grandma so much hell James❤
And am i going to spent an all nighter watching all of his videos with harry styles and or 1D in them? Yes, yes i am! And is it a monday? Yes,yes it is
Funny😅
Very well done Mr. Corden - we salute you for your service and I personally am excited to see what the future holds for you.
James, im living in sweden and you light up ever day of my life! 🤗
lol u all crazy. fake persona hahaha
I hear Angela is going to have an abortion good
Thank The Lord he's gone. Big phoney, huge! Bye james. Don't let the door hit you on the arse. 😅
i really believed that liam,louis,niall and zayn would of walked on but still its nice to see harry as the last episode ❤

I do drugs I don't eat really
Absolutely hilarious show congratulations on your next endeavor! 🎉💐
I miss you
Awesome. Another liberal show bites the dust. Keep politics out of "entertainment". A gratuitous plug for the worst president in history?!? Really? Ironically all of those "hosts" actually vote for President Trump but the networks won't let them promote that. Guaranteed.
wait so no more late late show / sad
Papa mochi😢
Oh Man!!!!! We want MORE!!!!!
How many takes did it take Biden to get that out? Talking to difficult for him ya know😂
were just pissed hes comin back ere mate
Harry styles ❤
Where is Conan?
Love u james 🇱🇰❤ Ur show is very joyful and interesting because of u
You’re all awesome 😎 Loads of love from South Africa ❤❤❤❤❤😢
Glad to see him go after what he did to Patrick Stewart, good riddance.
Does your wife and kids now know
The most lovable comdian in decades, now bows out with dignity and a inspired furture!!
Thank you James and everyone on this show. Your love and dedication has brought much joy to us. God bless you!!
Peace
That line “I’m grateful for the 8 years I spent with them and the 8 years I spent with you hits very hard.😢
LOVE YOU JAMES COVID-19 I BECAME A BIGGER FAN & WE BOTH LOVE BTS ❤️🌹 LOREDANA ROBERTS LOUISIANA ALEXANDRIA USA 🇺🇸
Thanks for  the unforgettable memories ❤️
I miss him already. However, he will get a talk shoe in England, if he doesn't they are fools. Love James! 💕 6/11/23
Thanks for the great show, James. Good luck on your future affairs. (Peter Rabbit 3, I hope)
Is it just me or that lady fell from just fist bumping harry
Why did the show end?
Awwww❤
Definitely my favorite host on the show hope he comes back one day
素晴らしい番組をありがとう！！
Always leave em wanting more. We’ll miss ya.
The girl who fell when harry first bumped her as he entered is me
This show brought me to tears. Amazing!!   My favorite late night show. Thank you for all the belly laughs that brought relief from covid depression. Best wishes. This is not goodbye,  because you are so talented. Look forward to seeing you soon. Love you James!
Harry: *Starts speaking* Everyone in the world: Awwwwww
Was in Margate few month back, with me nan and me Mam. Getting whelks at Mannings. There was a right to-do in the lavs. Me gran came out saying “fat fella in there telling people his willy whistles when he makes a wee” I lost me nut, took off in to the gents to find him. Turns out only Jimbo “Fatty” Corden. Dirty Beast and he had a winkle stuck up his back passage. A Rotter.
That was shit
Your are the best I Love your show such a blessing 🙌
Ah man why did it have to end! Him and Kimmel helped me so much through my depression its crazy this show was so hilarious and wholesome😢
Good riddance
Thank you so much for all these amazing years James, much love💗
I really thought he would do a last carpool karaoke with Harry😢  I’m so proud of you James thank you for making my life amazing for the last 8 years
He still has the tattoo😍😍
I’m trying so hard not to cry since the late late show was literally my childhood and that’s why I discovered One Direction mainly and I just love the show so much the Carpool Karaoke all of the everything it was amazing
All the memories😭😭
I can’t believe this is the end😢
where was Jay Leno in that opening skit? hehe
Probably a good decision to end the show now. It's still somewhat popular so they can go out on a relative high as opposed to total low
Sad that it ended, but so so glad that we got to experience it for 8 wonderful years. Thank you James and crew.
All The Best James Corden. Thanx For Those Wonderful 8 Years That You Have Entertained Us
It's completely understandable while you wanted to leave. But Thank you to You and your team for making it joyful! I hope everyone has many future joyful experiences in life and career!! Cheers!🎉
It’s over thank god the most annoying man in the business is gone
Never watched a single full episode.   I heard the show got cancelled because it cost more money to produce than it brought it.   How good could it have been?
Did any body else noticed that Harry flipped us off when he was showing his tattoo late late
Well done James. Ant n Dec eat ya heart out. You went and came back a legend. As a fellow Englishman, good luck for the future and you did a great job representing your country. RTID
James thank you for the hardwork and  dedication you and the crews put into the show will always remember and cherish the memories, the ending was wonderful and the song was awesome I had tears in my eyes seeing you so close to tears yourself it's sad to see you go but I pray that your future will be bright Good luck to your future endeavours may everything you do succeed in Jesus Name luv u🥹😘🥹😘❤❤

Thank you James, for introducing me to the iconic BTS on carpool karaoke.  ❤  Hate to see you go! 😢
Welcome h9me h7n, we have missed you ❤️ 😘 💕 much love Arlene from Dundee Scotland xoxoxo
James you will always be in my heart you are a really funny comedian, singer, dancer and your such a great man hopefully you will have a great future and bless your amazing heart James
JoeBiden's goodbye to James was so wonderful, can't imagine Trump evertaking the time to do this for anyone, or saying kind things to someone when he can't stand for any man to be praised, except of course for  himself.
Biden was definitely CGI
Oh waw, presiden USA
Aww Harry xo
Good old Will
That's cool they got all the other talkshow hosts involved
Who is the new host of the show?
How has it been 8 years?? That's gone so fast. It still kinda feels like a new show. But you look at someone like Harry, and he was first one with One Direction. Crazy
Irene lesbian orgy's
No money for Irene
Everybody knows
Baseball Mafia prostitution
Dodgers can't get it up
Nope depositions f    No depositions for irene and watch and see
No depositions for Irene go to hell
No money no huney
Jeff has a tape send it to t m z
No depositions for irene
Thanks James for the laughs, the music, the crew all these years your one of the reasons and inspirations I’ve wanted to have my own talk show one day 🥲💖
I literally had no idea James was ending the show I just thought carpool karaoke was ending 😭
Baseball and sports can go to hell
Is the show ending? Or did James just left the show?
It has been seven years since I started watching this incredible show, and I am grateful to be a part of its viewership. I would like to express my sincere appreciation to all the individuals involved in creating this remarkable program, as well as extend my heartfelt thanks to James Corden for his exceptional hosting.
Finally it's over. Good for all of us. Who's taking his spot tho?
Whole w for the internet
The start of this took my mind back to 'The Big Breakfast' with Chris Evans when he used to walk through the crowd to his desk for the show.
So funny, watching his whole ENTIRE crew / staff who all clearly fuc**ng hate him as he walks out!😂       I’m pretty confident this is the only time in history that people are actually blasé fair when pertaining to not being employed posted show ending. They are on probably uncomprehendingly stoked now they can chillax while soaking up their severance. The only issue they have right now at this moment in the show, is being able to convincingly hide the pure elation that has encompassed their being due to the realization they no longer have to be subjected to their contractual obligation’s to look at that Megalomaniac-tic Cheez-Dic of a fucking person EVER AGAIN!!!🕺🏽  -Fak-FUkEr!
So glad all three were posted so I could watch. Thank you!
My only thought... Why wasn't Conan or even Jay Leno on the skit? They should be the first ones on it... Just my opinion...
This is so sad. I've always wanted to visit a show :(
Wow....how is this in any way similar to fergusson's show....
I still can’t believe it ended .. I really really love ur show James u are the sweetest, wish u the best where ever u are whatever you’ll be up too XoXO
why did he have to smash the table tho... it could have been donated or auctioned and the money donated...
Thanks & goodbye james
if we would have had Will Ferrell do Carpool Karaoke, the internet may have possibly blown up.
This show .... Has been there for most my life. And honestly, it means ALOT to me, thank you for everything. Jame, the crew, and the guests, everyone did amazing and thanks for CBS for giving this shot. It changed lives. And it's wonderful, and this is truly an end of an era. Not just the carpool karaoke, but every single game that went on that dhow was fantastic, no words can describe the amount of joy i got from you James and yhe late late show. Completely speechless, Completely Sad for it to be ending although i really am happy for all the memories. And its okay to cry, we'd cry with you while watching, just Thank you! And thanks for having Harry and Will as your last guests. Its wws an astonishing episode. This one show, i will always be grateful for. Especially for The best, and the last, The final Episode.
I enjoyed his show at times. This just comes to show you must always be kind to EVERYONE. or you get cancelled.
WHERE THE FUCK WAS CONAN?
Will Ferrell is badass 😮❤
Hello, I am writing from Turkey and I hope you see this message. Your videos always make us laugh a lot, but unfortunately we don't understand some things. Please add Turkish subtitles. I hope you see this message. Please add Turkish subtitles
❤
😂😂
I cried days and days after The Ellen Show was cancelled.  And now The Late Late show comes to an end... I can't believe all of this is happening right now. These two were always my favorites .All the things that used to bring me joy are gone.  May peace flood your heart.  Because of you my parents still have a son. Thank you.... ❤️‍🩹
He bloody set me of crying when he said it was never my show it was our show
Starting the Video at 4:00pm. Now
THANK YOU JAMES❤❤
Harry Styles bringing back the 70'S housewife pantsuit.
Why did it end😢
Can’t believe it’s already been a month 💔
Why is this ending
Good show , he was always trying to entertain and never got to political. Thanks James
I'm from Poland, I always watch it on yt, why???? i loved this show
I wonder why'?
You can see that he really loved this show though. Even I almost cried.
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 James. Standing avation. It was just a great show.
im sure thom yorke is ecstatic about radioheads music being used in james corden comedy bits.
Goodbye James, you were my all time favourite late night host and you always will be ❤️ thank you for everything I mean it
❤
The end of an era 😢 love you James!
Thank you James ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Still here sayong that corden needs to bring out an album, such a brilliant singer, needs to do a duet with adele and everyone notable haha😂
Surprised Biden made it through the teleprompter
holy cringe imagine watching this xD
❤
Thank You James
The creativity of this show was supernatural . Goodbye and god bless.
Craig Ferguson did it better than you
Welkome home😂❤
Shut up James!! I was a HUGE fan of yours. I'm also from the UK and was really happy for you. Listening to this speech is laughable and not in a good way. My husband and I stopped watching your show when you dissed on Trump and helped divide this country even further! Keep politics out of comedy.
Love you James!
as a Conan fan, I've never liked or found him funny, so I couldn't care less...and after his true colours came through in the restaurant...
You will be missed 😢
James and Harry get on so well ❤
Love you man and crew. I'll miss you!
How come suddenly the table is fixed 😂
I think Tom Hanks should've been the guest as he was the first actor so the whole show comes full circle.
So freaking sad 😢
A toxic narcissist of a man! Good riddance
Anyone else notice the girl pass out when he fist bumped her😭😭
First one is the hardest one!   Congratulations
Thank you for the laughs, the cries, the fun, the smiles, and for the bad days you turned good, and the good days you turned better! We love you James and forever miss you and remember you! ❤️❤️❤️
James cries, I cry. 😭
What a way of ending this, everyone who has been a part of the show should feel very proud of all they’ve done for this series! Peace and love!☮️❤️
I dont know what people think about him in US but in Europe he is a living legend
So glad it’s over dudes annoying asf
17:46 that girl fainted after fist bumping harry styles, wow
Thank you for this show!
best late late ever, thanks James from Italy
I'm not crying you're crying 😭
me being british / aussie . it almost made me spew. absolute trash.
crap crap and more crap. usa comedians that are no way funny.
Thanks to everyone who worked so hard to make us laugh and to enjoy ourselves through the hard times we have faced ❤ love to you all hope that you all find jobs and your next steps in life and find fulfillment! ❤️❤️🥹
When he said 'give it up for him for the last time' I cried 5:13
Where are you? We miss you
Hey Angela good luck with the abortion
“From my favorite part: Gordon Ramsay’s Hell Cafeteria and Hotel Hell, trip to NASA training, Blackpink Carpool Karaoke, to this final show. Thanks for yours jokes and fun fun show” ~ viewer from (+62)
Why was the audience hugging like the war was over or somethin’ lol
Fakest intro ever
That song at the end...
That 12:37 hosts collab was the greatest since avengers endgame
i will genuinely miss james! what an incredible last episode :) <3
The show sucked. That's why it ended. Lolololol
such a great host
One Direction reunion, it's too soon.  Give it 15 more years when they're in their 50's.  That's what all the other groups do.
I was not a part of the show, nor guest, nor creator, but I am crying.
Harry Styles's speaking voice is sexy.
Why's the show ending??,
I so love James. Tissue time. God Bless you and thanks for all The joy ❤
Finally off air what waste of air time 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I was really really really really hoping for a final Steve Scalfati special for the news intro!  Ah well.  Please release a compilation of all the best ones soon! <3
COME   OUT  THE   CLOSET  JAMES  !!!!
Thanks from Madrid, Spain, cause you made me laught and gave me too much energy to stand up when I needed and I nobody was able to make me laugh but YOU ❤😊
Never found the show funny but happy retirement
Good riddance
I realized that the point what difference between The Late Late Show and other shows. This amazing show is not only forced James and guests, but also staffs and audiences. They all make this amazing show. I definitely miss this show but I will watch them again and again on YouTube ＼(^^)／
He's such a rude person. NO one is missing that Jack Ass when he leaves.  Good bye, so long, adios!
My eyes are sweating
The best show ♥️
i’m only 14 years old and i watched these for like 5-7 years now and i really cried during the last ones. Thank you James for always putting a smile on my face as a little kid and now too. I / We will miss you! Thank you for everything❤️
as one door closes another opens today we finally close the door to the past and open the door to the new future but we never forget the past and the thing we always remember is the good and bad memories the past gave us and we shall cherish them forever  thank you James for everything you’ve done and making us laugh each time
The bit with all our other late night talk show hosts!! Loved it!!
SO GLAD ITS FINALLY OVER THANK FUCK 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😂😂

Did anyone else see the girl that fistbumped Harry fall or faint at 17:52? Also, I got a bit emotional seeing this final episode of the late late show with James Corden and laughed a lot as well
I guess he won't have another show back in his motherlamd 🥲
17:52 she fainted. The girl the back
ouff i will miss this show, i loved ittt i will miss 2023, well bye bye 2023
Noooo!!!! I didn't know this is the last episode 😭
How nice seeing all the host coming together,  late2 show universe
Did James leave because of that rudeness scandal last year? Don’t really watch the show, don’t know
this has literally been a comfort show for me I was never not resonating or uninterested its so heartbreaking to see him go but I'm so proud of all of what james and the crew created for us in his time on air
That song to close out the show did me in. Thank you to everyone who was a part of this show; you brought so much light into my life. You got me to watch and enjoy late night! I look forward to what lies ahead for you 🥺🙏🏼
I wonder why the didnt renew his contract?.
Would you like to fly today with me for what you did for me? We can, I know 🎉
Well said JC
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
😊😊😊
So many emotions felt watching this! Thank you James and your crew for all your dedication to bring joy and laughter to our lives for the past 8 years. I wish you the best embarking on your new journey. 🤍✨
Good riddance. Guy is a complete D-bag.
A very gracious and humbling goodbye! James, I wish you the best in all your future endeavours! Thank you!
god how much im gonna miss this show
🥺🥺🥺,,,
Lol 15:01 the reaction
What will be watching if the late late show comes to an end
Ever since I discovered James this has been my favorite show. Every time I’d get home from work and turn on the tv to watch him . I know he made a lot of people happy . I thank everyone in producing as well , this show wouldn’t have been possible without you . I’ll miss you James you’ll always be king of the late late show
Puta madre!! Que buen cierre para James y para el programa!!
For all the people cheering, like this and props to you.

Final he's leaving.
God's blessings to you and your family.   You will be greatly missed!
He typed 4444 yet it still worked. :)
They should sell the pieces of his desk
20:50 is he flipping James off?
Hallelujah! Praise god!
Marvelous 💕🌺
Thank god this is history now!
17:46-17:51 Reggie Watts: It's Harry Styles!  18:04-18:10 Reggie Watts: It's William Ferrell!
Sorry your radio station stinks
😢😢😢
Chelsea handler should have late late night tinder as a show!
I’ve watched you since Gavin and Stacey… and I don’t think you realise how funny you are. A bit like my husband… but I hope you are coming back for Gavin and Stacey xx
He gets the award for brushing off less than a decade. I preferred the days of the Johnnys and Letterman's.
Or wait I thought that they were actually going to show Trump. That's why I rote that. Hahaha
There's no way that was actually Joe Biden. But I don't know that might have been Trump. Lol
This show has brought so much joy to me through the pandemic and two awful breakups - I will miss it so much. 🥹 Anytime I need a pick me up I watch some of his crosswalk musicals, carpool karaokes, take a breaks, and so many others. thank you, James! ❤️
Good riddance
I'm so glad I finally got a chance to watch this 'last' show that will last forever!!
Its good to see this ego maniac go! Yehaa off into the Sunset..
James, you are a ray of sunshine wherever you go! You are an example of someone who looks for the light and the laugh. Thanks for all the laughs and good times and best of luck on your new adventure. America was a better place while you were here.
I can't believe this is really over. 😢 You gave so much love and fun also here in Europe. I miss the whole gang. ❤ All the best for the future.
Don’t wanna give too many words but thank you
Great show and finale.  Thank you for the time, dedication, love, and laughs.  Kudos.  :-)
You know what they always say When one door closes another one opens Maybe someday we'll get another late late show host.  Maybe we'll get another late late show who knows? But for now we bid farewell but not forever.  Thanks for everything James

Thanks James.
Your show has always been like a peacefull place where I forget about my problems for a few minutes, thanks for bringing so much joy for us during those 8 years, you' ll be missed.
Allegedly Harry is a jerk in real life and to work with and so is James … so that speech is ironic imo
The band......ufff too much!!!
Carpool Karaoke was inspired. The rest of the show was meh.
Closed the last show like a true English gentleman… sit back and take notes USA👌
Loved your shows james  ,one of the best, THANK YOU and  love from IND ❤✨
James' last late late show, aired the very day my wife passed away.  I was in no frame of mind to watch TV.  I spent time with all my 4 children and we kept each other company, and busy.  It's been the worst two weeks of my life, but I love James Corden.  As a Brit, I am looking forward to him coming home, but will miss his Late late show.  Today I am finally able to watch the last show.  Thank you James for 8 great years.
ORIGIN IS COOL , YOUR MY UNCLE TOLK !
Christian Camacho Lands
Awesome cell
Christian Real Estate !
"Reins."  He took the reins.  Not the "reigns."
Poor Harry....  I'm selfishly glad he's GOING home!  We don't want him here.
Harry Styles,somebody told him he is a star,he dress like 5 year old kid.
When audience was clapping for him it was Trump town hall.
"We are more all the same than we are different." James Corden
Please do one last Carpool Karaoke, with Korn!
You know you created something amazing when the president gives you a goodbye message!!!
you're remains a legend for us
You're embarrassing your country 😂😂😂
James is a living Disney character. Thank you and bless you for the bright future!
The internet will never be the same without the James Corden show 🥺
This was so sad for me. But my question is how did the desk at the end get there?
Love you still remember watching your first show ever just randomly one night not knowing what it was and I’m so glad I was able to see your first and last show ❤
Thank god it’s his last show. How he’s managed 8 years in that job is amazing, oh no wait it’s not amazing he curtailed to his bosses wishes, never wrote material for show, isn’t funny at all, jumped on the hate Trump wagon with absolute conviction and he’s not even American and a complete sellout for money and fame. And he bows to biden, sad.
Lol. Good riddance.
We  don't want you back in London
Yo pls tell me someone else saw that girl pass out after fist bumping Harry styles

Damn james and jimmy were the goats it hurts seeing one leave 😢
Literally I'm sitting in balcony at 1:29AM and cried watching this show. Love you james LOVE FROM INDIA 🇮🇳
whens Smithy coming back to Barry
America  a country of optimism.  Yeah right
Who paid for the radio Jeff's Mafia family
The radio station stinks
Passcode is my birthdate!. 🤣🤣🤣
Sorry Corden is not funny.
That was a really good closing speech. His family should be proud!
Let's just face it- most of the boys that were obsessed with model cars and airplanes were just addicted to huffing glue. Halfway joking
Glad it’s finally over
holy shit. james corden sucked just bad as he did when he started.. lame as hell
Bravo ❤
As an expat myself I totally get the dilemma that he faces, to stay in LA living his best life, or to go home to family.  Returning to rainy England from LA is going to be depressing in so many ways and there will be days when he wonders whether it was the right choice. But on the bright side, maybe Ness can have an answer to her question now? What's occurring Smithy?
Finally this crap is over. Not just this but all the stupid late night shows, for now. I hope the writers strike never ends.
So sad 😢
What a great entertainer! James is funny, talented, unpredictable, all of the above! It's sad that he's decided to end his show after only 8 years, I thought for sure he was gonna stick it out with his late night show until retirement but he knows he's just got bigger and better things planned ahead for the future. Thanks for all the laughs and tears during the past 8 years you were on James! I hope we get to see you on TV again soon in the next chapter of your life! Until then....🍻, Best of luck to you and your family!
Why is it over
the end of an era ❤
Dang I begin watching this channel and it's already over :o
👀 looks inside my purse a lot off artiste 👩‍🎨 how many you want for your shows !!!
But why? Can anyone tell me the reason?
I loved this show, Iam shocked
I like how they avoided having Fallon walk in for the fake smile bit but instead walk in half a minute later.
There’s so much hate and division in the modern society and I just can’t describe how fulfilling and life-asserting these goodbye words were. I have nothing but hope that this word can be a better place even though it doesn’t seem to be like that. And this last episode was just so touching. Thanks to everyone who participated in making this show. You could even reach a girl living in Europe and make her laugh and forget the routine problems at least for a couple of minutes. It means a lot. Thank you!
Welcome Home James. I've loved watching your show on YouTube. 👏👏👏👏👏🇬🇧👏👏👏👏👏
You adorable adorable man! Lots of love 💕
); <3
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Hope the US hold onto him, can’t be arsed with him back
All of you are absolutely awesome ! ❤
Thank you for everything mate, from All the way from Australia
Finally
Surprised Tom cruise wasn't on the last show.
HARRY STYLES!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Let’s go
Wouldn't it have been easier to just ask the cameramen for help? Why would the production team not just help him? This seems staged... 😑
8 für die Unendlichkeit oder die Veränderung , the  6+6 4 no groll 2 the ppl in Statements  you left, we hope and wish you  to find a better Way in the Future as a free Person!  Thx  4 bringing Joy 2 us all, we are varry happy to see ppl still have a Way and dont get punished from old habits . Good luck in the future
Hopefully you will keep him in America
painful.
Bye 🥺💞💞💞
But why?
You are a GOOD MAN James.
Why is nobody talking bout the desk coming back??
I love his sense of humor and kind demeanor.  What a beautiful soul.  Thanks for the laughs.
Didn’t realise anyone actually liked James corden or his show
How is this possible? I am shocked. I never even thought it could stop some day! This show made people sing all across the world, spreading joy and confidence and laughters. ❤❤❤❤
We love you James! Casually crying over here. Have an amazing time back at home.
He cant ever be truly replaced but theres only one Id wanna see take the seat. Craig Ferguson.
James this doesn’t have to end…….do it here in the UK so we can all enjoy it 🇬🇧 🇺🇸
we'll miss you man. thanks for everything.
...and remember, you cannot send him back like you did with Pies Morgan, you have to keep him .
I love James Corden, but I'm disappointed that the final episode of his Late Late Show was such a white bro-fest.
Talent is the grandtotal of transformation of being an artist....thus the abbreviattion of smart est ....thus amzing things...thus for harry styles...a real king of pop ...king of rock n roll in pro genxt
I’m watching you from Nepal 🇳🇵… from Last 4 years…. Thanks For Entertain us 🙏 .. I Had so much Fun Watching Your SHOW… We will Missing You.. LOVE FROM NEPAL 🇳🇵
Terrible show....😢

Thank you James for doing this show
I thought Harry would be an amazing host.
Is James making way for Trevor Noah??
A lot of passion in your work,a lot of talent and good sense! Thank you all and good life!
Now go ruin another show
He finished typical English humor at opening.. respect for that
❤️🌻 to you All.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA I LOVE U
What a lame opening stuck in ge stairwell. It must ve because the writers strike that they came up with something scraping the bottom of the barrel idea. Oh the waste of that time and ill never get it back. THANK GOD FOR FAST FORWARD
My childhood😢😢😢
This show has helped me so much over the years and I am going to miss it
why couldn't he just stay in LA? We don't want him back in the UK! Dude is annoying as hell!
Go James, you bloody legend 🇦🇺❤️🥰🙏🏻
💞 Thanks for the joy James, l wish you all the happiness a ❤ can hold. ..Oh & I want to start a rumour & say your starting a Twitter Channel 🙏  🫂
Thank you James & company! You brought laughter & joy into our lives.
He went off on style it will be good to have him back in the uk
I always found him so arrogant and rude he took his "apparent fame too another level which disgusted me!😊
Gonna miss you James 🥲
Hes fake he's talentless wake up people
James is not talented in any way shape or form... lol @bianca
Had no idea Darwin is still alive
James and this show got me through my lowest times, depression and anxiety at their peak, but the humor, the band, all the writers and crew and staff, and the sincerety of their joy got me through it all. As I'm watching it, I'm trying not to cry buts it's such an absolutely beautiful and wonderful thing you guys have done.  I wish so much love to all of you and I hope you guys keep making the world a better place. ❤❤  Congratulations 🎉🎉
Just watched this final show.. and i am so emotional.. 😭
Why does every good thing needs to end 🥲
Bye Kimberly
damn the mods working overtime
Why do all good thing come to an End?😢😢😢😢😢😢
I wonder ( I hope)  if he will continue with driving and singing in cars singing. Sorry to here you are leaving I compare you with Trevor  North both of you have always (in my opinion) been very real. Good in your future  endeavors.

No matter whatever u start next we will support u James forever. Love u James.
I'm glad his show is canceled
damn right!
😥
Was that actually the entire final episode? Pretty disappointing really
We love you James 💕
Positive side is the "down low" is far more acceptable in Britain.
James thanks for making me laugh all these years and good luck on your next project, I will always root for you 🎉🎉🎉👏👏😍🥰🙏🙏
I wonder why his show is ending with this gold? lol he just needed to fire the writers and leave the woke BS behind. Go woke go broke. James even followed the narrative and still they canned him lol
5yrs tuned in with James and the team and here it is. So proud of all your accomplishments, how far you've taken the show and CBS, the fun, joy and smiles you've brought to my face and of all the others. It's so hard to hold back the tears because my mom had promised to get me on a flight to the US just to attend the show but here it is, finished! Thanks James and i can't wait to see what the future holds in stock for you... Much love ♥️, Georgie
Hello James Corden! I would like to inform you that I find your videos on YouTube very entertaining and interesting. I am a content creator on my YouTube channel in Russian and would like to use some of your videos, translate them into Russian and broadcast them to Russian-speaking viewers with a humorous subtext. I would be very grateful if you could give me permission to use your content. I will, of course, attribute and link to your channel in the description of each video. If you need anything else, please let me know. Thank you very much for your attention and understanding.
Dude why is no one noticing the girl that fainted after harry fist bumped her🤡
Thankyou James
This can't be😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
LAME
He’s a grounded lad the years he’s worked to get where he has today has been a long journey, his mum and dad made sure he didn’t get above himself and to be honest and true towards others, the stars he has around him are just like him, Adele, Harry Styles, Prince Harry Tom cruise down to earth approachable and kind. Good luck with the rest of your career james
I appreciated James' reminder to America that the world once saw us as optimists and we should all get along with one another. We were the lucky ones to have you as part of our daily lives. Best of luck and happiness to you and yours in England.❤
I loved this show so much so that this was my favourite late night show because it’s very wholesome and genuinely funny show. Love the band’s nuances, writer’s mid-show jokes and at last James’s funny yet don’t give a shit attitude. I guess that studio floor was a safe funny space for all the crews as it was for the audience and viewers.  I’m sad that the show is ending and I can’t look forward for new episodes every week on YouTube. But, at last Congratulations James and team for all the success, love you have got.. and Thank you for making us laugh through good times and bad times. 🤍
Everyone smiling and clapping at the beginning were paid to do so. Or just very happy this garbage is finally over 😂
You could see he was trying not to cry the whole time! I was too! I’ve watched this guy all my life growing up and he has never failed to bring a smile to my face! So watching this made me so emotional!! Thank you James for everything! For all the wonderful times we had with you! Those memories will be with all of us forever! Enjoy being with your family you deserve it! Wishing you and your family all the love and happiness!! THANK YOU!
Thank you!
What a relief, such a terrible show
minute 30 to 35, I'm not sure if I want to hug him or vote for him, I would do both
Did anyone else notice that when the woman got fist bumped by Harry is looks like she almost fainted
Will needs go jail for wrecking that desk like everybody do
Why the police didn't lock Will Ferrell up for tore James desk?
So James, you are so completely talented and I adore your comedy.  With that being said, how did you get our bumbling, horrifying, country wrecking, girl sniffing president to string together 3 coherent sentences?
So many tears. What an amazing man
is someone going through and flagging the negative comments. Ohhhh the irony. I standby what I said about this terrible person and shame on you for defending James and how he treats other people.
Do Americans get pissed off with all that pointless inane whooping & screaming? Or is it just the rest of the world?  Like wtf is that all about? Is the warm up guy handing out crack? I've wondered for years... Like any group of dancers that fumble & stagger about to hit their mark, line up, link Arms and get ready to unison High kick.... darn it, I bet some of you couldn't stop yourself from clappin anna hollerin before you read that I'd written darn it! Why? Why do you do it? Have you a clue how stupid it makes you appear to the rest of the world? No, thought not.
I'm full on sobbing, i'm gonna miss James so much, i've seen every episode for 8 years, i feel like im losing a part of me
The best thing about this show is its over
I don't want Irene to be a part of my family
The show was losing 20 million dollars a year. No one was watching this garbage beyond the absolute brain-dead.
Really sweet of Biden
I think he is consistently great on this show. An impossible task.
Wow I cannot believe that such an amazing show is coming to an end ,I watched the late late Show every single day   and I cannot even begin to imagine how it's going to be without you guys .thank you for putting on such an amazing show ,we will miss you .
thank god this show is finally over, good riddance to another unlikeable late night host
😢you will be sooo missed James. Thank you for all the years of laughing ☺️☺️❣️❣️❣️⭕️❌⭕️❌⭕️❌
rip bozo
I always thought the james corden hate was overdone but its criminal he didnt mention Craig Ferguson. Seriously how dare they just forget about the GOD that handed it down to them. Arguably the best late night host of all time going by unmentioned is crazy.
What a great 8years it has been. Wishing you the best in your next chapter. I hope that final message will resonate with everyone that hears it as the world needs it soo much!! Thank you for all the joy and laughter you brought to us all.
We have Corden, Colbert and Kimmel. Networks changed Colbert's show to accommodate losing letterman((huge mistake, Colbert is his own entity)) Kimmel and the tonight show I nothing new it's the same tonight show we've been watching since Carson. That leaves Corden, king of night comedy, and after only 8yrs the network is stupid enough to take him off the air?? He's perfect for late night comedy.  Another network needs to pick him up and create a whole new show for him  CBS=MORONS
Glad he's gone! Tired of Canadian coming to America and criticize us, bye piers Morgan bye Simon!
Thanks for all the happy memories man I loved every bit of your show, I Love You and I just hope you come back with something else to "fill our guts." Good Bye James and lots of love from India.
This is one of my favorite show. Sad that he is leaving this show.
James, thx for everything 😢
Dam wish I could of been there didn’t think it was going to end like the Ellen show
Most horrible host of most horrible show  I never met a James Corden fan in my real life
I can't be more happy James deserved this
We gonna miss you :')
Thank you James for bringing us joys and wonderful memories all these years 🎉 LOVE FROM CHINA🇨🇳  谢谢
We are all more same than differents. Love❤
this is so emotional
Never gonna forget carpools spill your guts and every other laugh James gave to us 😂
Get out yr sick bags
finally, 1 season was already too long for this garbage
So moving and full of love and gratitude. Great Corden!
James asking harry the most awaited questions for the last time was so much needed .. we love his efforts so much.. if ever 1d comes back please we need a part with james
❤ I was so proud the very first time i seen this show i was going through my divorce and James and The Late Late Show helped me get me through the hard times and made me laugh God bless you James have a blessed time back in the UK with your family on your new adventures God bless you
17:49 poor lady fainted
This show raised me iam gonna miss this man so much
Love you James 💙
I think that All food is delicious but made to look like disgusting 😅
THANK GOD FOR PUTTING END TO THIS SUBHUMAN PIECE OF TRASH SHOW. THE WORLD HAS BECOME BETTER.
I am so impressed❤ Thank you so much James😊 From Japan
JAMES PLEASE READ!!!! ❤ So many bits where my favorite, being an assistant, doing funny stunts, the eating gross food, car karaoke, which all was fun to watch but My families favorite was the intersection performances you put on during a red light, in the middle of a busy intersection.  We loved those. We actually still watch some of them on YouTube to laugh at when friends and family come over.   No one can fill your shoes. We’re going to miss you so much 😢 thank you for so much fun and laughter you brought into our home. Your show would bring my family together You brought life, joy and fun back to TV. We all loved and laughed, the kids would get our snacks together and we sit back and enjoy your show.   You’re the king 👑 of late late late late TV! Every episode we’ve watched was so much fun. It’s your personality that was something that made you so unique and so much fun to watch, there’s no personality on TV like yours. Thank you James for bringing some light into our lives during times when we needed it the most.   There’s no other show like yours. ABSOLUTELY NO ONE CAN Fill those SHOES! I’m going to miss your smile and the funny ways you make us laugh. You’re the best Late night TV host and it won’t be the same without you. Sending many thanks and love to you and prayers to you and your beautiful family and parents. ❤
Thank God. 🗑️
Still think James is stupid to walk away from guaranteed success.
🖤 Thank you for all the entertainment over the years, James Corden
This was one of my favorite almost shows to watch, it always helped me laughed. I loved watching everyday. Thank u so much.❤️🫶
thanks for gifting us with this full episode :) <3
Good. Now less jerks on tv
I love this show he is so natura
No one can fill James' shoes! YOU WILL DEFINITELY BE MISSED JAMES , but I APPLAUD YOU for taking this time to watch your BEAUTIFUL FAMILY GROW! A TRUE GENTLEMAN!💯☝️❤️🔥💔👶😘😚👋🌞
Be sure to order some disgusting egg yolk omelettes. Call the waitress silly has you scream at her. Frack you hoser.
Why why why, I loved this guy show, and his hansome face
20:50  Not Harry flipping everyone off😂
Thank you James!!
He is such a talented man. Love when he jumped out the plane With Tom Cruise, and then when he did the street crosswalk show with Harry styles, were truly hilarious..I think he's just all-around wonderful. His show will be truly missed ❤
I’m so happy this show is over
Grazie James per l'amicizia vera che hai con Harry, si vede che gli vuoi bene sinceramente, sei uno dei pochi, grazie per questo. Anche io voglio bene a Harry, anche se non l'ho mai conosciuto. Vi voglio bene ❤
This show was a down grade to Craig Ferguson, Craig Kilborn, and Tom Snyder.  It was still better than Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel, and Stephen Colbert
James sei una bella persona, ti auguro il meglio, e spero tu abbia presto un nuovo programma perché sei unico e meraviglioso. Ammiro il tuo modo di porti con gli ospiti, sei gentile e riesci a mettere tutti a proprio agio. Ti auguro tanta felicità e serenità. Ti voglio bene James.
Got a bit of time on his hands now, can we finally find out if smithy says yes to Nessa. And what happened on the fishing trip 😂
Around 2018 I found the videos from the late late Show with James Corden on YouTube, because I became a fan of One Direction. And I started to like the english language, the pronounciation. My native language is german. And my english teachers often told me, that my english is not good. And then, I found the videos from  the late late show with James Corden with One Direction as guests on youtube and watched those. And I was able the understand, what in the videos was said. This gave me more confidence, because I knew, that my english is not as bad as I thought. My english is still not the best, but I am able to understand interviews in english, maybe not every single word, but the most.   2018 I turnt 17, now I am 21, almost 22 and I love to watch videos on youtube from english tv shows. I like how english sounds and the fact, that I don't understand every single word in english. It isn't easy to explain.
Will be missing the Late Late Show & James a lot! ❤️
Love you, James Corden! Thanks for all the laughs. The USA 🇺🇸 was blessed to have you for a while. Best wishes for you and your family back in Britain 🇬🇧
Finally
One Direction reunion❤
Nunca pierdas esa sensibilidad.. Te Amamos James! ❤
thank god its over
Thank you...🎉😢
she'll be alright
Harry saying that about the one direction reunion made the whole fandom scream fr . And I think he made it clear that it might not happen but never to get our hopes down
Harry said “ TPWK THE TOMMO WAY “
Thank you James for 8 incredible years . Much love ❤️
Why is the show ending?
Thank you James thank you so much you make me happy when I’m having the worst day ever every car pull spill your guts all the games jokes news guests singing everything you do makes me so happy I’m gonna miss you and all of these nights so much and your crew I’m gonna miss so much this was the best eight years of my life you’re amazing and no one will ever forget you, you are a legend and I hope you have an amazing life! THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING YOU ARE THE BESTTT
did anyone see that girl faint after she fistbumped Harry 💀
You will truly be missed!!
I've watched the show for 6 years, it's sad to see the show comes to an end. I'll miss you, James. Thank you and the team for a great show. All the best!
I suffer with Insomnia.  JC, you have been my late night companion for years.   No one will ever make me laugh as much you do.  I wish you the very best with all your future endeavors.  God bless.
Finally!
James singin in last parttt>>>>>>>✨🧿😩♥️
I’m not crying, you are.
Thank God this guy won't have a show
17:52 whoops
We'll miss you James 😭 Wishing you all the best in life ❤️🙏
We will miss you, You are Amazing!
Was the desk Craig Ferguson too?
James Corden is a great personality and added a lot of fun to late night. Having all the other late nite personalities on was brilliant. And getting Will Ferrell and Harry Styles' to finish the Show was epic. Harry is so on-time funny i think Will couldn't keep up!! and Adele's Carpool visit  was the icing.. but the song, was perfect - love this guy!! I think his appeal was more fun than some of the other shows  ❤️
I cant imagine why such a show would make such huge losses and have such poor viewing figures when you look at the guests in the thumbnail lol.
Finally, this dogshit show axed❤️❤️
You gave joy to all around the world with this show and your crew. Wish you the best and love from Istanbul, Turkey ❤❤❤
The Late Late Show is forever! Love from Japan 🇯🇵 xx
WE MISS YOU JAMES
W
Hope the other "late nights" follow the same course.
20:50 he is showing the middle finger 😱
James Corden gets to send off his show in style. Tucker Carlson, on the other hand... LOL
Will miss you James❤😢.
Kumbaya, my lord Kumbaya, my Lord

Love u James ❤

when james said 'part of me thinks why not stay here forever...but deep down in my heart I just know' we all really felt it !

End of the era man we will miss you James Corden

We are gonna miss you so much James 😢😭
This was very emotional. Thank you James and the team for all these years! ❤ Your show has been a huge source of positivity and light in my own life. It has provided joy and laughter during times when it has been hard to find. Thank you.
💛💜
you may hate him, you may love him.... but, Corden has definitely given us a really FUN time run as a late LATE show host since his debut in 2015.  bye James...and good luck.
The world is finally healing James Corden is no more
With tears streaming down my face, I wish you James, a very blessed new chapter of yours and your families life. You are so sincere and such a beautiful person. I will miss you always. ❤
I’m going to miss this show. I would watch a daily show of spill your guts though no lie. That show would be so popular.
HELL YEAH! WE ARE FREED!
Thank you so much.  😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

Harry's speech was so honest
Goat. Will be missed dearly

No one’s talking about the girl who fainted at 17:47 after Harry Styles gave her a fist bump 💀
how dare u play an awesome radiohead song :/
35:41 THATS MY COUSIN IN THE BACKROUND BROO
My favorite show is your very first. It was daring, crazy, and very outside the box. I was so happy to go on that ride with you. Thanks for all the hilarity and joy.
All the sheep and bots in the comments. This dude was a horrible mess
As much as people wanna hate, ill miss this show so much!!!
My favorite host ever funny and very brilliant ❤
I’ve never watched a full episode, but the clips I’ve seen have definitely brought joy and escape. James is one of a kind!  Also: JAMES CORDEN FOR PRESIDENT 2024!!

Good riddance, jackass lol
I hope that papa mochi and baby mochi get reunited someday
Where did the new desk come from😭
James, we need one more carpoolkaraooke! With Beyoncé👑🐝
Oh my god 🥺😭💜🔮Love you so Much James and whole team ! For  bringing happiness and laughs in our lives! Forever Grateful and Thankfull !🌟We will miss you so much ! LOVE YOU INFINITELY 💜🔮
Finally 👏
We will absolutely miss you always @jamescorden 😢 I'm sorry to see you go
Let’s f3cking go, glad to see that the man that loves to harass public service workers is finally gone!
Good riddance
That song at the end was terrible 😂😂😂😂😂
Why did the show end?
I’m gonna miss this show so much. James, you have been an inspiration and a safe space for so many.
James you should do your own youtube. Channel to spend more time with fam
I'm gonna miss this😭
He says that the whole family is here...and say hello to mother and father...but where is the wife, children, the others???
A kid who went to holmer Green senior school in Buckinghamshire, England, went on to host the late late show in LA. Absolutely amazing and inspiring, I can remember my teachers talking about James when he first came on TV. We never knew he'd make it this big in America too. God bless ya James, mate.
Will crazy
I hate watching James tear up. By the end I was sobbing. James is such a wonderful person. I think that's why truly kind  people like Harry and Will gravitate towards him. I want to thank Ben Winston and crew for bringing us James and One Direction. America is better for it. James you are so sweet and we will miss you. Thank you for the last 8 years.
This show and with Jimmy Fallon is are my favourites shows.
Cried and laughed the whole time 🥹🥹
My goal is to host an original late night show of my own someday. Obviously people are gonna tell me i can’t do it and that I don’t the skills and vigilance to do it. I say to them, you’re 3% right, but 100% wrong because i am going to do it and kill it my own classy way. It’s the only way i will work.  James Corden rapidly became a powerhouse in my household. I was in high school when JCo took over the late late show. He did it is way, his wittiness and his own aura is it.
🥰🥰🥰I love James Corden!🥰🥰🥰 He should come back for his late show in AMERICA!🥰🥰 Raising a kid without money is hard! He needs to come back!😘
All the best James you were my most favorite host. Lots of love from India.
so sad this show is over!!!
Harry, Zayn, Louis, Liam & Niall, when I'm on the verge of giving up on everything: 20:12
love u guys
Please tell me I wasn’t the only person who cried at the the end 😢 I will miss him so match even though I have never tspalked to him but I feel so attached to him ❤❤❤❤❤
Thank you James for all the hours of joy. Welcome Home to Europe. I am looking forward to see your new Projekts.
Those were the nicest things that any outsider has said about America.  Great show.
Eu vou sentir muita falta do James e do The Late Late Show. Tenho acompanhado ele desde que vi o vídeo dos meninos da One Direction no programa. É triste saber que acabou o programa, mas já dizia a One Direction “É inevitável que tudo que é bom acabe”. Deu pra sentir o quanto o James ficou emocionado. Eu gostaria de ser entrevistada por ele algum dia, mas infelizmente o programa acabou antes que eu me tornasse famosa hahaha. Este programa sempre vai ter um lugar especial no meu coração, através dele, eu tive bons momentos enquanto eu estava triste :)
I was always waiting Dua Lipa to have Carpool Karaoke with James Corden, but finally this is the end of the show. I’m heartbroken, but I still love James Corden and the Late late show. And I had so beautiful time watching it.
Why James corden is touching harry too much
Tbh i only came here for harry 😀🙌
Although lots of people hate on James, I must say this show has been a big part of my life.
Funny how there is almost 6M views but only 147K likes.
Hahahaha your show got CANCELED!!!!  You are NOT funny!
YOU'RE EMBARRASSING YOUR COUNTRY😭😭
We also have one from Trump sent me😭😭😂😂😭
28:04 Harry's face 😂
This show was pretty much the only thing that got me through covid
Good timing for James. The recently new owner of CBS at Television City will be demolishing their offices and studios building in 2024 and rebuild bigger and better.
i wonder how many comments talking about how insanely egotistical he is have been hidden lmao
How i love this show ❤️ so sad this is the fina day🫤 I'm gonna miss miss you James Corden late late night show....
You're so horrible to staff, I'm glad you're off the air.
I love james corden hes such a lovely guy xx
The audience hugging eachother.. you sure left a mark James Corden and crew ❤
Thank you for everything James, I loved your show, I will definitely miss you.
❤
Great job, thanks to all of you guys!!!!
Damn it James you made me cry bro. Take care always my man.
Now James can be funny in England.
BTS again
Probably the only host whom each and every celebrity felt comfortable around with. He was willing to play the fool and make his audience laugh instead of making the fool out of celebrities. Thank you loads James! Hope you have a wonderful life with your family! ❤
Harry can tour in the summer when shows are on hiatus and do his talk show in the fall and winter😅
Going to miss this show and James Corden.  Let Harry Styles have a late show now!❤
Its really a shame to see the end of this show, mainly because there is a chance he will come back to the UK.  We have had 7 years of peace away from this cockwomble.  Please dont send him back to us.
Well done James. We love you.
Oh my 🥹🥺😭 Harry’s little talk with James & James’ speech about America 🇺🇸 just really hit me in the feels. Then, James struggling at the last few words to his song through tears… absolutely BLESSED to have had him entertain us throughout the passed 8 years ESPECIALLY with Harry ❤ what beautiful souls they truly are! I will miss this show so dang much 😢 thank you James 🙏
So grateful for this show ...it has gotten me thru a lot of terrible times... especially thru Covid...James is so brilliant energetic smart funny talented hillarious warm hearted! I was very Angry and disappointed when it was announced that the show was coming to an end...good luck in all of your future endeavors James Cordon🙏❤️✌️🌹💔💯
Honestly that was longer than expected 8 years Honestly was so so so boring was so fake what happened too tmz and the actual good talk shows 🎉literally felt like the last 8 years have just been shuved down our throats even his last speech felt fack 🎉😂
Love the Radiohead tune in the intro.
Will Ferrell is an a-hole. Yuck!
Keep picturing Not for Broadcast. Eek.
Excellent outgoing!
🎉What a great show. Thanx a thousand times.🎉❤😊
James is pure joy and hope. On my worst days I would look up video here and it made me feel a little better about life. I’m terribly sad that he’s leaving, but I understand that he has different responsibilities, opportunities , and ideas for the future💕💕 I hope to see that One Direction reunion one day with James doing some kind of interview like he did for the Made in the A.M.  album. The world loves you James Corden❤️
As someone who has been a fan of this show since its inception, it's bittersweet to see it come to an end. But seeing the impact it had on people's lives, like the commenter who used it as a source of joy during a difficult time, just shows the power of entertainment and the importance of spreading positivity in the world. Thank you to James and everyone involved in this show for bringing laughter and happiness into our lives. You will be missed, but your legacy will live on.
Isn't it amazing that a "foreigner" had to remind America why he came, what we were and what has happened to us in 8 years? Well done.
Why no conan?!?
By the gods. It took 1,200 shows but he finally made me laugh one time with that Biden comedy sketch... that was satire... right? 10:27 The irony.   14:26 Decision? Since he thinks his audience is too smooth-brained to know any better (and he may be right), he was FIRED for costing his state-controlled propaganda network $20 million per year due to terrible ratings.
Confirms what an ass he is when right away he makes fun of his mom’s Botox injections.
Enjoy Haites James!
Good riddance of bad rubbish!!!
17:52 after the girl just fist bumped harry and fell over in awe im. losing it
Sayonara, you unfunny soyboy diva
THANK YOU CORDEN 🤍🤍🤍 Will miss carpool karaoke, but go enjoy life. You've done your part, well done man
Im devastated at the ending of this show! He is so amazing!!
The light in the world just dimmed a little at this loss. You've helped me find joy and laugh in the hardest and most stressful times. Thank you, you'll be missed
I have to admit I never watched this show until the pandemic-but it quickly became one of my favorites because I loved the family feeling between James and the people who worked with him (staff seems too trivial). I loved the band and the team of writers, and Ian, and Nick! It was all just dumb banter that made me feel like part of this dysfunctional family. Thank you so much for giving me that feeling of camaraderie that I was missing so much while cooped up in my NY apartment!
Thank you! Thanx for the joy and belly laughs! This show will be forever loved and sadly missed.
james never failed to make us laugh or smile and im deffo gonna miss him smmmm
I'll genuinely miss him more than anything 💔
i’m sobbing, thank you james for everything!! the past 8 years have been amazing, welcome home ❤❤❤❤
why?
Did that girl faint when Harry gave her a fist bump?
national anthem RAdoiwHWEAD REFERCEN ??!?!?!?!?
was really hoping one direction would get back together on the last show
Welp on to jimmy fallon or Kimmel.
If only audience screamed less 😬
Never have I watched this show, of some English bloke with an Engluh accent. I couldn't understand a word he was saying.
Go woke go broke
Goodbye James and the entire staff of the Late Late Show. Thank you for 8 wonderful years ❤ wishing you all happiness and success in your future ❤
that was an amazing 8 years thank you so much james! The amount of tears i cried at this is unbelieveable. I may only be young but you have been a massive impact on my life so thank you once again for doing all that you have done. I am so greatfull!!🫶🏼
Saw this show for the first when time after my wife passed away and it helped so much into being able to laugh again..I'm very thankful indeed..I am not crying its just the dust in the air...yours very truly Alfonso Cantu USMC
Don't cry because he came Be happy that his gone
The fact that James Corden never stated that most of his bits were stolen from Sean Lock, is a disgrace.
Thank you for 8 awesome years 💛
What harry said about reunion yes or no?
One more " this show saved my life, my marriage, my etc..." im goin to bed
Just so you all know the ratio is 145k thumbs up to 2.7 million thumbs down 👎
WHAT A LOAD OF TOSH….😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Awful … Glad to see the back of it…
The last performance....
Llore ojala te podamos ver en otro programa te vamos a extrañar!!! 😍
awwww sooo sad! you will be missed!!!
Couldn’t have ended soon enough.
Senile Joe WoW you are going up in a falling world Janes could I call you Jim ir Himny perhaps anyway your alright mare Greetings from the North Riding of Yorkshire UK Godbless You and your mum and dad  ❤😊
this show was amazing James thanks for doing the difference , I will miss this show a lot
Brilliant show! ❤❤❤❤❤❤
We r done with u thx god
i can't believe it's over
love you james
i cried when harry say that things
my babyyyy harryyyyyyyy
Who watching this is gullible enough to think those were real tears?  He is a frigging actor!!!
He can run 😂
17:48 let's all take a moment to appreciate 1) the girl fainting after a fist bump with Harry and 2) Harry *grabbing and kissing* a bald man's head. i love that man.
This was the most emotional and amazingly memoriable closure to any show that i was fortunate to see. Thank you @JamesCorden: you are a gem with the right priority values and because of that you will continue to be great and do great things!
All those people who work behind the scenes are thinking He is only being nice to us because the cameras are on him.  If the public only knew what a bastard he really is.
Love you, James Gordon!!! Will miss your show and Carpool Karaoke! Enjoy Whatever is Next on Your Agenda and Be Happy! 🙂👍❤
The crew at the beginning clapping and cheering thinking 'the cunts finally leaving!!!'
Did anyone notice the girl falling after palm fist with harry style? 😂
ladies and gentlemen…(editors) the show where all your edit clips come from is ending. WHAT WILL WE DO.
personality ruined your own show and career 💕💕
Harrys Styles are 🤮
Honestly we are going to miss this🥺💔
Thanks James for all the memories! <3
Classy end to a wonderful late late show. Thank you for keeping us entertained all these years, James Corden.
I’m gonna miss this so much 😢😢
I'm gonna miss you Jaaaaameeees 😭❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Maaf james,, aku tau acara ini gara-gara BTS.. Dan karena aku suka maka aku subscribe.. Sangat sedih karena acara ini harus berakhir,, Semoga sukses selalu James,, aku akan sangat merindukan mu,, maaf karena terlambat tahu tentang ini😔🥺😢
Will miss it!
I started watching this show early on in the pandemic and continued watching through late nights awake after having my second baby in 2021. The camaraderie and trust tree that has been this cast and crew got me through a lot and I looked forward to it every day! I will definitely miss getting my daily news from James, but I guess now its time to go back and watch old episodes!! Thanks for everything, Late Late Show!
I’m going to freaking miss you.
Everyone clapping because his ass is gone not because they were celebrating him
You did really good job. I will miss this show so bad 😢
never cried that much just because of a show , you have been a huge part of my life and I'm gonna miss watching your show so muchh i love you james
Finally over 🙏
Thank you James for this show! I am honoured that I got the chance to watch this show!
Anyone see the big girl fall/pass out after she fist bumped Harry on his way in
I'm so sad cuz you also were the person to bring one direction really close to each other and asked all questions to harry which the whole fandom wanted to know❤
thank you guys for everything😫❤
it was going well until that crazy President came on
You will NOT be missed
Will Ferrell is ❤❤❤❤❤
Thank u James always be grateful for you
Will never forgive the internet trolls for bullying James out of the late late show
From the first 5 minutes I can see why the show got cancelled
Tysm for everything James.. This was one of my fav becoz of all the various content...it was never boring..  Thanks again James and staff
I love how late night show hosts participated in his last episode❤
James’ mum seems sweet and his only reply is about her Botox ...
He's leaving America because of the mass shootings.
Hate that America has gotten so bad that it’s most likely one of the biggest reasons that James left the US and ended the show.
The interaction with the staff at the beginning felt so forced and disingenuous … at least Ellen knew to quietly sneak away without a full-on production that read false start to end.
One word- CONAN?
James is a genius.  Sad to see the show.  Good fortune to you and the staff of the show. 34:27
Gw melihat ada niall
Humans it's all the same .. yawn, and how much do these actors get paid to kiss ass.  Maybe nothing monetary but they do by being promoted.  I always thought that as a child, what a joke.  HoLywOoD rules the world.  Bye bye James .. You will be soon doing yet another Car Coffee or whatever Seinfeld does, or whatever Letterman is doing now "My next guest" ... Super reach/super rich ... carry on with the demographic masses of humanity.  Indeed I have laughed a few times, but it's all the same.  PuRa ViDa ..chap
Will miss you James et al!!  Thank you for all the laughs.  It has been awesome having this to share with my family.  So many laughs.  Best wishes to you on your next endeavor.
JAMES  would  make a better king 🤴  in England  that king Charles   !!! We love James and we are sure the English  people  would love  James so much better than King Charles
I had no idea that James Corden could sing and play piano.  I hope he starts producing songs other than tv shows.  Amazing singer and piano player other than tv talk show host.
Tell me I'm not the only one that cry with THE ENDING of the show?? OMG IT WAS PERFECT. WE WOULD FOREVER LOVE YOU JAMES, THANK YOU FOR ALL THE JOY YOU GAVE US.
Miss you James
I love Will Ferrell he is so funny 🤣
What a sweet, warmly funny final show.
I still see him as daffyds little brother. 🤣🤣🤣
why are they ending it?
Fortunately that STENCH IS NO LONGER POLLUTING THE AIR WAVES 🤮. So happy that cbs wised up on the years of toilet bowl ratings and ditched this disgrace. Fortunately I was never held at gunpoint so I never had to endure a full episode, but the few ads and snippets revealed a self centered “I’m great, just ask me” narcissist.
and nothing of value was lost
sereno ricco di sentimenti
Allora siamo noi il nuovo
Loved the show!   Sorry to see it go. Best of luck to you James ❤
love the late show
See you for another level of show❤🎉
Final show could have been longer.
James not liked by all it seems...keep seeing bad press about him being disrespectful and short tempered. Bet the Late Late team have a few stories to tell.
Well, that was the suckiest 5min intro, in the history of all intros, EVER.. 😴
I assure that the most loved carpool karaoke would have been the one with Mac Miller
Hell no, I'm not even a regular watcher, but the smiles and joy, why end happiness, thank you.
❤🎉😂
When Harry said leave America, he meant James Cordon all along
I'm crying...life changing... Thanks James Corden
I miss James Corden already😔 Why CBS!? Why!?!?!?!?!?!?
Oh James🥺🥺🥺. You'll be missed. You're loved immensely
He missed the change to bring One Direction in the same room 😭😭😭❤️
We meet again, good lck and THANK YOU
first time they showed it in prime time in australia first time i watched it in full worth the wait love james very funny good move to go back to england wouldn’t like to bring up my kids in american schools 🇦🇺🫶
Im not going to lie and say Late Late show was my favourite, (in fact I cant really say which one is) but I really enjoyed some of the moments on here. The Tom Cruise bits, Spill your guts, crosswalk concerts, carpool karaoke and i checked in regularly for the lockdown episodes with just the crew as the audience. You guys provided some really good entertainment and for that I thank you.
Theres no way i could not cry if i was there. I would bawl and cry lol omll 😭😭😭♥️♥️♥️
Love you James Corden best of luck in what you do next in life. Enjoyed watching the show all these years
I love you James 🥺♥️ you absolute gem 💎 ❤ 💖 😘😘😘😘😘 take care love
You’re my fav YouTuber 🫶🏾🤎, I love when you post !
We Americans are losing such an amazing talent and beautiful soul! It makes me cry. But also, we can't hold it against you James, to "go home". I absolutely LOVE that you are putting your family first, and I know you will keep spreading light and joy wherever your path leads. Much love to you and all of your team for creating so much magic for us over the years! ♥
Brilliant last show ❤
13:23 so you all do realise that but still continue to do it
I will surely miss this show! Made me laugh and cry the time. Bless you James. Lots love ❤😢
No Nick?!
I really will miss the show, I loved the games, interviews, news, and especially the banter with the band and Ian, that was always so much fun. Wishing you and all the crew the best.
Where is Nick?
I am crying. No words can express the thanks to James Corden and his crew.   Sending positive thoughts and prayers for the next chapter in your life’s journey, James. ❤
Yes  finally the worst talk show by the worsr comedian in the world ends!
The solar eclipse seen from Indonesia  https://youtube.com/shorts/PVduUky-rKw?feature=share
Did this show end on James' decision or was it because it was losing money?
He is just the best ♥
Although I'm not a huge fan of yours, I really enjoyed some of the episodes you created. I still can't believe this show ended, because it's been a part of my life for four years.Thank you for being there for me in good and bad times; without this show, I couldn't even go on. You and the other crew members made so many memories and histories , whether it was Carpool Karaoke or spill your guts fill your guts, etc...  These are the moments I will always remember and  cherish. Many thanks to you and the team for your dedication to this show . For me, this is not the end, it's a fresh start, I am looking forward to your next plan.💜
Is it just me or is the crowd cheering really overdone. It went on way too long and in response to every little thing anyone said. It was so off-putting. Harry lifted his sleeve and you'd swear he stripped naked. He couldn't even get through a sentence without the audience participating.
All my heart!! 💜 James you are a beautiful soul. I was privileged to see Trevor Noah on his last day & seeing this just makes it more clear these shows have so much more power than inciting a laugh …. It’s really in the joy they leave us with. James we will miss you on the screen. 💜
Night James.  See you out there, maybe.
Love James!
I have only watched excerpts but I'm crying after watching this last episode. Very heartfelt. Best wishes to you James Corden.
I hope you're coming home, James!  Will Ferrel awesome.  Great night, great friends will always follow you - be with you <3
Love you James! Be blessed ❤
this was amazing!! thank you for everything James 🤍
Well now the the show is over i think  its time to unsubscribe.
Letterman stole the show with one line.
Love this show! Gonna miss it!
You can tell those women didn’t want to be touched by him 😂
James can do broadway or sitcoms😅
Damn my cheeks hurts from smiling… gonna miss LLNS 😞
It was a great, great- late, late show. I will miss karaoke carpool. If you didn’t like U.S. should have come to Canada, eh. Enjoy your future endeavors ❤
Plse guys i already miss him so much i cant😢😢

Omg I’m crying 😭
Closing A show that millions of people love, Stupid story!!! The television authorities have completely gone crazy !!!! Idiots!!!
I'm sitting on my couch thousands of miles away with tears. Enjoyed your show. It exuded love. ❤😊
Been a big fan since i first disocvered Gavin & Stacy, and James' first late late show,  when he knocked on his neighbors' doors yo tell them he was the nrw host, snd ended up broadcasting that first show from one of them. Love all his skits,  esp carpool karaoke, the musicals in traffic, and everything in between.  Thankful for Hulu,  where we can rewatch some of his shows! James will be so missed!! Reggie and everyone else too!!  😢🎉
GOOD FUCKING RIDDANCE
I'll miss you James, much love from Nigeria 😭💕💓💓🤎💚❤️♥️♥️💌💞💞❣️❤️
Definitely cried 😢 Gonna miss my morning monologues, every creative bit, and the hilarious crew...Come back to us one day! 😭💜
Hes been offered more money in England.
4:30 LOL
Im gonna miss this masterpiece show
James has been such a good sport and positive person all the way.  I really enjoy watching this show.  Thank you for making me happy and laughing by watching your shows.
I'm not crying T-T
God I will really miss James 😢
I always watched carpool karaoke and cross walk musical while eating.....this was my favorite thing to do during covid......love you james❤
How dare you to make me cry the whole time. i love this show so much and will miss it. But i think there is no better way for the last episode. I wish James and the whole team the absolutely best for the future.
Can we all appreciate the love and effort that The Late Late Show with James Corden puts into his videos??
❤
Was it part of an act in the stairs? 😅
Finally! It’s over!!! 😂🙏🏼🥳
why is it ending ?
I will be miss this snow(
You are an amazing soul James!
Sad to hear that this is the last one!!
THE MOST ICONIC EXIT!!
We love you, James, and we'll always miss you.  You're goodbye song was heartfelt and just as heartbreaking for us as it was for you.
Sorry to see this end you’re the best!
The best!

end of an era,you will be missed always😢
This was so wholesome
I couldn’t stop crying. You are the best James Corden! Thank you.
Why ending are always sad and painful 😢😢😢
Its sad because all the good talk shows are  diminishing
Glad he tried to keep us & the crowd laughing because the amount of times I had to hold back tears & throat kept getting tight is crazy, this show brought so many great memories & to see celebrities enjoy a car pool ride with laugh & all that. We’ll miss & love ya James thanks for the good times mate 🥺🥹🥹
Go broke get woke
That was pretty Good... Why do I feel like I need to say goodbye in some other language? Oodgay-eyebay. Didn't think I could do it did you?
Thank you for everything james❤❤
Sad!!! Right when I graduated college, I planned to come to one of your shows :'( now I'm sad forever!!!!! -- Good luck on your journey home, James! You will surely be missed!
I'm balling! 😢 but also, so full of happiness! ❤ James, you will be missed GREATLY! From little ol' us in CANADA! 🫂🥰
I will miss the show soooo much it has done so much for so much people you have been an amazing host James we will all miss you
wholesome
the late late show with james corden has been my favorite to watch on youtube for years and years. Carpool karaoke, spill your guts, and crosswalk concerts were my fave amongst the many and have brought me so much joy.   I remember when my grandmother passed away last year amidst covid, I restumbled across the carpool karaoke with paul mccartney and recall replaying it throughout the day and it somehow it made me feel better.   Thanks to everyone at the late late show for spreading a good laugh, best of Luck James!
🥺😢😭
We’re going to miss this so much. Thank you for all these years❤
Feel the love ,,,thank you love love love your show  love to you and your amazing family james we miss you ❤❤❤
YES! Thank you James cordon for ending this show! YOU ARE NOT FUNNY 😂
Loved how james exited and the staff that also build the show took center stage as deserved for the hard work they all gave for the show
James, I don't get CBS at home in Manila but i always catch your shows on youtube and all the things you did just like what you said has provided a speck of light in a rather varied series of unfortunate events in my life starting from my Mom's Cancer, Fighting it, Make it harder to fight it because of the lockdowns, financial instability because of the lockdowns, contracting covid , up until my Mom's passing this year. your show has always been a welcome reprieve from all the stressors and in turn that small retreat watching you and your guests make fun of each other and sing in cars has given me strength to persevere.   Thank you.   love from the Philippines
I couldn't stop crying for the last episode of The Late Late Show. It was literally, my therapy for so many years. I feel blessed and lucky to participate in the live audience once, back in 23rd of May 2018. At the first break of recording, floor manager (or audience animateur) cane straight to me and gave me the one of two giveaway tshirts with the logo of the show, wich I keep it like a treasure.  Goodbye James Corden, thank you for giving us the most valuable thing for our souls, thank you for making us laugh with all of our hearts and crying at the end as Chaplin did.  We love you.  (Try Greece sometime)
I’m not crying.. you are..😢 Thank you guys for all the laughs and the good time!
Can’t really express how much this show meant to me, thank you so much for everything!!🥺
I’m crying 😢💔
Why not Conan or Samantha Bee? Coco has a podcast.
Ive never watched the show but have enjoyed the carpool over the years. I dont know much about James but do know hes a fellow brit and good for him for making something of himself.
Bourgeois bullshit, remember to eat your bugs and boost as often as possible everyone.
Ooh!!I looove this...ooh getting all these TV show hosts together...this had been one of the best Hillarious Shows that the World has enjoyed for years!!!...ooh Love Corden!!!!
Knob
39:02 his last line transitioning to the guitar solo. Goosebumps
James' relatively sudden departure has left a bad taste in my mouth, now it all seems like it was nothing more than a money grab.
What's next ?
Nice To Meet You !!! ❤🙏🏻
I cried so much when he was doing his speech 😢😢😢
most positive person since Degeneres.
how could he keep it together?? I was bawling my eyes out
Good riddance
James we are grateful for everything that you and your team have done for us! You are a legend ❤
will ferrell
I will never froget this momment❤
I remember watching the very first episodes, so crazy and fun. And they honed it down and it evolved. Always great.
This is the only late show and my confort show when my life started to be a mess. But im gratefull to see him sing one last time 😢
Superbe show hilarant plein d'humour,  de merveilleux moments musicaux. Bravo !!
Well said, James. Thanks for reminding us that we have more in common , as humans, than that which divides us. Let's stop being so devisive and come together to compromise and do what's best for this planet. Love and mutual respect bring us together and hate tears us apart and does not solve anything. Thank you for 8 wonderful years of joy, James.
Thanks for being amazing❤
great finale. been watching since the craig kilbourne days. crazy how time flys. guess ill have to watch this new midnight show.
Finally it's over. What an overrated show with such awful slap stick comedy. No wonder it' has no UK following. Won't miss this one
Change for sure .. you should not bag on Mr. Trump. You wealthy stars are very lucky America is great .. Biden’s America is so dangerous .. and has cost many their lives. Fentanyl and trafficking through a gaping non existent border .. be realistic little stars .. funny yet hypocritical.
OMG i'm crying!!!
I watched some outtakes of the show over the years, but this was the first show I sat thru the whole thing, and it was really not necessary 😑 I'm fine with small snips ✌️
Love you , James... Thank you for your service and love. God bless you 🙏
Thank you James for putting smiles on our faces even for us all the way in Africa (Zambia).
Crying my eyes out here James… I’m gonna miss this show
I cant forget when u meet with gordon ramsey
Why does this feel like the nightmare I had the other day?  😂😂😂
We will miss u James🥹❤️✨
Gordon ramsay
You will be missed James. You were the very best late night host. ❤
Rip to the best late show🙏💔
Who's crying? Im crying, im crying really hard! thanks for a fun show James Cordon! will miss your carpool karaoke
President Obama mother side  came to the  new world  came  Plymouth  Massachusetts in 1630  President Obama mother side is Christian white woman  be here for a long time
Never seen such a real life A$$hole be portrayed as such an overly friendly & sincerely nice person on TV!!!
17:50 That Harry Styles fan fainted after fist-bumping him!!
James, you are a bright light and I will miss your show. Bravo! ❤
Cordon is definitely gay. Everyone knows it except him.
Did the Beyonce of Late night television just walk out?! 😭
Brilliant ❤
Tons of great bits over the years but my favorite is still (and you can still see it on youtube!) The Late Late Show and Jeff Goldblum Invade Tommy's House !!!
I can not believe that this is the last episode it feels like one direction has broken up again
Every segment they did was fun and creative. James Corden is a genius and the whole team are genius! I was really looking forward to seeing new episodes with my favorite artists in this show especially the Carpool Karaoke.. It's sad the show's has come to its end.
I can't believe it's over! That was so emotional. James you are one of my all time favourite hosts. I'm so sad to see you go. But I wish you the best!
Broadway pleaseeee 😊
great final show I pray the very best to James Corden and his family thanks for all the laughs
Embarrasing
This end was absolutely brilliant. Great way to say goodbye. Thank you, James Corden. Your content will always make me laugh
Sadly that's was so boring!
James & show crew, you will be missed! OMG not gonna lie, I'm in tears. James you are a ray of sunshine on a cloudy day. You have always made me laugh and smile and sing along with Carpool karaoke! I will truly miss you...🥹🥹 Best wishes to all of you🩷🥰🌟💐🌞🌈🌷💝
Its sad that it is ending
I enjoyed some these episodes I’ve been watching this for a long time even before I understood half the content in this show 😂
I rarely watched the Late Late Show except for videos like the spill ur guts with Gordon Ramsey, but i will say it's been a journey even if I didn't watch a whole lot. Congrats on ur retirement man.
Simply and unequivocally love you, Mr. James Corden.
I'm so proud of James for the reasons he's chosen to leave the show! ❤❤ He'll be missed 😢
This episode feels so forced
Thanks a lot James Corden for all the laughs and very memorable memories with the biggest stars in the world and has taught us many things in life. Goodbye.
I remember the very first time I knew James Corden was with Justin Bieber in their Carpool Karaoke and I really thought he was just a driver that drives around celebrities and sings along with them but the more I know he has always been the best late night host I've ever known ever in the whole world.
This was quite emotional, I didn't expect this would be the last show and it would end this early than I expect although I wish James Corden all the best in the future of the on coming challenges on the daily basis.
Thank you James
🔥
Cant wait to see Limmys reaction video
Aloha James thank you for everything. Going to miss your show.
Good luck James❤❤Thank u so much for every piece of joy the show bringing for me❤❤
Best of Luck to you All❤❤❤
Though he was gonna smash Corden with sledgehammer , oh well
*cries in a cool way*
irreplaceable presenter in late late show, will miss you
so sad, James hopefully you will do a great show like this wherever you go.
This guy was nowhere close to as good as Craig Ferguson.
I remember seeing James talk to the boys on 1D Day, and ever since then I watched his show and it got me through so much, thank you for being my comfort 😢
We miss you🥹💖💖💖😔😭
Finally end
Thank you James for bringing light, love and laughter to our evenings. 😢❤
❤❤James has been one of my favorite hosts and now that he’s leaving I hope he can enjoy his time off to the fullest with his family and the people that he loves. ❤❤  Now with that being said… I suggest Hasan Minhaj as the next host of any Late show.
Out with a whimper, not a bang. Missed opportunity. But, i guess bridges have been burned.
So so sad 😢❤❤❤❤❤
Glad its over, couldn't  stand corden
Will and Harry back together.  A must for royalists...
love from Mostar ❤
😢❤
VERY WELL SAID!!!   CHEERIO MATE!😅  ☯️🐯😎
James helped me to learn English back in High School. Then I got to see him Live in London... Now the years have passed, I'm in the middle of my twenties, and I can just say kudos to this guy. His show had a great impact on many people, and will be missed. All the best!
Had me crying after the first 5 minutes. I love James. He's hilarious. Going to miss him❤️
I was always a part time watcher of this show (the youtube algorithm is partially to blame) but this brought tears to my eyes. I wish the cast and crew all good things in the future!
This show is strictly for the Yanks. All the schmaltz, rehearsed-to-death dialogue and all-round goody goody makes a Brit sick to his stomach. Where's the vomit bucket?
We will always be your fans! Than you for those great moments. From Brazil!!
what the hell!!! this is an absolutely great show with original material that  makes me laugh out loud
Thank you, James and the gang! Best in every way. Sincere, heart-warming, loving. Я вас очень-очень люблю! ❤
We all sobbed right???
Did anyone else notice the girl faint when Harry gave her a first bump when entering @17:50?
definitely cried at the end of the show, thank you james corden for all that you've done these last 8 years - what a legend you forever will be!
😢😭😭😭😭😭😭😭💔💔💔 #sinpalabras 🤐 #thankyou 👏👏👏👏
aww that was definately a show! Great speech at the end... had me in tears. Thanks for the light Late Late show x
Didn't come close to Craig Ferguson
Best show ever 😍😍😍 love you JC 🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻
You will truly be missed. We love you Man 🥰💕❤💔
We wouldn’t Happen Ahhahah
I still cant believe james is leaving istg this show is amazing and i love it with all my heart, this video was so emotional and i actually cried and i absolutely loved it when james said we have to look for joy he's such a wonderful person and he has a white heart filled with love and joy ill never forget the days i sit and watch his show and laughed i also love how he's always so funny his show is one of a kind, he has done sm to come all this way i am super proud i love james and i wish him happiness all the time and id like to thank all the team for their hard work The Late Late Show will always be in my heart<3
what a beautiful way to close a journey
🙌🏼 ❤
the show was unique and so much fun, I'm gonna missed it. I hope he come back again...! the show must go on without changing anything.
Also will miss the voice of (robot) Ben during the show.  He is funny AF plus hot too. plus Ian's sharp-witted  humor and the band's shenanigans, and the banter with the 'senior  vice president', and the 'celebrity noses'. and the chit-chat with the staff of their weekend/holiday went, and the carpool karaoke, and the bit where the actors. replayed their famous movie roles, and the bits with the Ben (the writer) and the rest of the writers, and the camera crew *fins up baby*! 🤧🤧😍😍.
We will miss u James 😢 💔
this show was such a sanctuary for me every night after work. i used to come home and watch it on youtube coz of course cbs is not available where i live in Lahore, Pakistan. On bad days especially this used to be the show that relaxed me and helped me think clearer. James and his band and the genuinely funny rants every night with the team was hilarious, relaxing and so much fun to watch. It was lovely, i think i will watch the reruns on youtube forever just to relax myself with the banter and the sketches. we saw the staff/team get married, have babies, move on with their lives etc. and it was so human and fun to be a part of all of it. idk if you guys will read any of it, but it was fantastic. farewell James, I hope we get to watch you again in something great. also i hope that everyone who made this show see more success in their lives.
What a lovely man. Look for the light...look for the joy!
Awwwh... Harry Styles my celebrity crush 😅😅😅😅..Kudos James Corden...can't get enough of your shows...all of them...from carpool karaoke,crosswalk musicals,Helping Joe Biden n Riri break...The adventures with Helicopter.....The interview with  Prince Harry ..etc....Super Proud of You James🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
ill miss it af
loved it truly
"I implore you to remember what America signifies".... best part of this speech! ❤
This Was FANTASTICALLY Hilarious. Love it.
I'm sorry but I watched this whole Show is goin away the most time. It's not about the Show is goin to end. It's a whole Marketing Trip for each and every character, mostly of course for the Host. It's such Theater its  pathetic. Hollywood at its 'finest'.
Amazing ❤️❤️ I loved it I love you James 💞 we will miss you This was an amazing show 💖😥
this bozo finally gone from california back to his weird speaking country in europe??.......
Ended the show with a banger! Love this 😂🎉❤
We will always miss you James. Always. Blessings from Buenos Aires, Argentina. Durong the pandemic, you kept my family and me good company. We love you.
There are no words to describe the shock of how I felt when I heard that this wonderful show was ending... Although, I'm glad that James chose what he thought was best for himself, even if all of his fans are sad to see him go. Wish you the best of luck James!
You can see James trying to hold back the tears before he says his final goodbyes from USA before he spends quality time with his only son and two daughters in his home in London
This show will forever be the best talk show
Thank you vor everything James - Thank you for bringing the light you talked about Even To Austria on the other Side of the World!!! Thank you, we will Miss this Show so Hard!!!! ❤️🇦🇹
The table made a comeback...
Great comedian
We're gonna miss you guys. One of the funniest shows on late night good luck in all you do
So sad James is leaving 😢
did no one see the girl that fainted after fist bumping harry styles 😭😭😭😭
So sad , great show is ending
You can’t have all the late night hosts without Conan.
Seems like no one knows the dark truth about James corden… I use to love watching him but good thing this show is ending because he’s a terrible human being that mistreats his staff.
I will miss Karpool Karaoke but he grew to be very politically arrogant.
What a pathetic last show this was...good riddance.
Absolutely emotional this whole episode. We will miss you in American James! Best endeavors back home ❤
JAMES, I'M VERY VERY GRATEFUL FOR ALL THE LAUGHTER, HAPPINESS, AND JOY DURING WATCHING YOUR TALK SHOW OVER THE YEARS. I've never found a talk show as creative as this, it has so many programs and we'll never forget it, not even one. I'M CRYING, THIS SHOULD END HERE. JAMES, WE ALL LOVE YOU. I will remember all your messages. KEEP MAKING LAUGHS FOR THE WORLD JAMES!
Gay.
Conan! Lol.
it killed me when harry kisses the girl on the forehead and she falls
Nice 😍😍
15:47 This part was so perfect
James you are the absolute best!!!!!! You've changed America and made it great again with your presence and gift of giving us such joy, love, light, faith and laughter. I'm soo sad to see you go but soo happy for you and what wonderful things the future holds for you and your family❤❤❤❤❤thank you thank you thank you for everything!!!!!
Not funny at all....😢
I will always appreciate this talk show, it has brought so much laughter and joy into me every single time I watch it. I’m so sad to watch it come to an end but I am very much thankful this show came into my life. I wish James the best on his new chapter in life 🫶🏼
does that mean no more fake karaoke car ep's ?   xD
You made me smile every time, i watch you ..Bless your Heart James Corden.. You shall be missed. ❤ I do have tears running down my face. Your amazing Fan from Ontario Canada
This was the BEST late night show, bar none. I have always lived by the mountra to live everyday to the fullest. James, you helped me to show my granddaughter to sing your heart out (we do carpool karaoke but only QUEEN). I have shown her to laugh and dance and be the best person she can be. I cried through most of your ending monolog. You seem to get what most Americans don't. Thank you for all of your songs, skits and in general GOOD NATURE.  CBS.... YOU CAN'T FILL HIS SHOES NO MATTER WHERE YOU LOOK.  James, you are loved.... always.
Great show. Sorry it's ending but I wish him and his family well on their next chapter.
But...who will lick the DNCs bottoms clean now that you're gone..?
Good riddance.
later lardazz, your show was trash
Thank you do much for this 8 years of happiness. Brazil loves you James. ❤❤❤
You will be missed James!
My Fav. One!❤
And nothing of value was lost
Tbh. Lets ALL be candid. I am already in mourning, knowing that we will NEVER ever again see the level of candid, comfortabilty and genuine reflection of Harry Styles with any other host evar again. And THATS fucking special and worth mourning.
You did a brilliant job with the show over the years  ..James.. gonna miss watching your shows during my dinner out here in Dubai .. Wish you the best in your next chapter mate …
Really excellent show will miss James and his entire crew. I can't tell you how much light you brought into our homes. Much love and we'll wishes sent to all of you. Thanks again😊❤
Where's the rest of the episode? Would love to see the chat about the Grammy's.
End of another era. Funny how you don't realise  the impact of something that really should be superficial, and yet has become a staple in our pop culture. No matter what you think of James, we still tuned in,... he has always has the best guests, the best unique segments and let's not mention the iconic car karaoke! Farewell James. Its been grande.
Must be really devastating for Americans. I have never tuned in this show and I’m sad it ended.
I remember last year I had a major exam and your show brought me happiness and laughter. Can’t wait to see what you do next James.❤
The girl who fist pumped harty styles 😯i would die😁😁
Hey, James!!! You know you COULD have just given the reins to Reggie...
was it just me or did that woman fainted after harry fist pumped her 😂😂😂 honestly can't blame her
8:36 A.M. Wednesday 5-3-2023  James Cordon was by far the BEST talk show host and Mr. Cordon will be missed. Kelly Clark
His staff must love him so much to get him a message from the President.
I think I turned deaf after watching this. Please stop screaming ladies.
Ily james 💗
Im not a die hard fan. I remember hearing the name JAMES CORDEN from a movie trailer from the true story of Paul Potts titled ONE CHANCE. I  still haven't seen it.  But James if you don't mind would you be an absolute doll and swing by Montecito on your way to the airport to pick up Haz and Megsy Baby along with their 2 adorable imaginary children and take them with you to the UK please?
So emotional I’m gonna miss carpool and spill your guts😢
Thx for a great show, i miss u
Thank you James Corden!
one of the best endings to anything ever wishing you all so much love and enjoy coming home with your family James x
Thank you for the past 8 years. And good night and good luck. Great line up for your last night.
❤
I was up late one night and scrolled through the channels and there you were I’ve watched every episode since. Your the greatest natural honest funny and immensely cheerful. It may be your last episode but remember reruns live forever🙃. On a serious note can’t wait to see what the future holds you were a the Fresh Prince of late nite and can’t wait to see your next chapter. I was thinking a morning talk show like the guys version of the view! You’ll be missed while you get many offers I’m certain what ever you do will be amazing can’t wait! It’s not good bye only till we see your work again.
Thank you very much for the years of laughter , fun , creativity...I am from Singapore and literally watch your Late Late Show on YouTube. It's very emotional for those who loves your show and yes many of us definitely in tears. Thank you very much to you and your fantastic team. Thank you so much ..😢😢😢😭😭😭
As usual, lame..🙄   But extra 0.5 point, for the guests 😏
17:44 is where Harry Styles part started
Im going to miss this show so much 😭❤
I cannot imagine a Better show that can get the same rating and bring laughter and joy like James Corden😮. Best of everything to you in your future!!
what a great show !!! I will miss you,😍 I will miss James, 😍I will miss everybody! I am so sad😔 😃😃
Carpool karaoke in that car was my favorite and giving a person A Break
Back in the 90s, I used to collect magazines from the UK like Smash Hits and Big, there was an article that featured James Corden in his late teens/early 20s acting in a sitcom...as young as he were during that time, it shows how much he loves to entertain and is incredibly talented...Good luck in your future endeavor James!
17:50 After first bump, the lady went to another dimension 😄😄
Thank you for all the shows! You are one of the best host James.❤
the multiverse of late shows hahahaha love that part ahahah
Damn!
good riddance lol
17:52 the lady just instantly fainted lol
I heard hes nice on csmera but a pr off
The staff seems very happy.  Is it because he will be gone?
I ugly cried my eyes out 😢during his last song and re-watched it 10x. What a catharsis.
please don't come back to the UK.... Please.....
Thank goodness it ended before the writers' strike
I'm crying, can't believe this is the last show. But still, I wish you all a wonderful journey to the next chapter of your career!
Thank you James,I'll miss this Show.Good luck..Lea NZ
This show was my go to whenever I felt sad or was in low mood. This show really never failed to make me laugh, it made me think of things I’m greatful for. I would rewatch every show for the nth time, still revokes same feeling. This show will always be part of our lifetime ❤
James thank you for all the laughs, getting me through hard days & nights and severe depression. We were lucky to get to borrow you for 8 years and you’ll truly be missed!♥️♥️♥️
This is the most amazing final episode ive ever seen in Television. Thanks James and to all your incredible Team. Love from the Philippines. 🫶
all three are average
im gonna miss this show🙃🙃🙃
This show looks like a lot of fun and it brings a lot of laughs into my life
Why it ended though?
Absolutely lovely
Thanks for everything, million kisses from Spain
We are all going to miss you and including the celebrities as well cuz we all love you and we respect your decision to leave it's just we feel heartbroken that you're leaving but I want you to know that you have our support both us as your fans and supporters including the celebrities who love you we all love you❤❤❤❤❤❤
This is sooo beautiful ❤❤❤ Thaaank you very much for the joy
finally getting rid of this money sink of a show hosted by a two faced abusive asshat
I wasn't born or brought up in the USA nor in England rather in a country continents away from these two but that couldn't stop me from watching this show. This show has given me so much joy over the past 6/7 years but most importantly, I found my only source of happiness in life back in the start of 2020 from a particular episode of Carpool Karaoke and I can't thank James enough for introducing me to the world of what I now believe is the prime source of my happiness, joy and the only reason I am going forward with this life. As serious as it may sound, it is infact the truth that if weren't for that one carpool karaoke episode, I might not have been here writing this comment now. And, I will forever and always remember to express my gratitude towards James for that. One thing I must add that even if james didn't, as an aundience, I for sure took this show for granted because I never thought there would come a day when I'd shed tears over a late night show ending. Dear James, thank you for all those skits and segments and keeping me alive with endless entertainment during the pandemic, thank you for spill your guts or fill your guts, thank you for the carpool karaokes, thank you for all the singing & dancing and thank you for such a cool closure ! It's the song at the end that made me write all these big essays in the comment section, lol. But in all seriousness, I really wish you the best in your life, in your career and with your family James. I hope you'd continue to do what you do best even when you're not doing this show. Godspeed.
Oh no🥺🥺😭
We all love you I love you too and all of your friends too who have their own shows as well including your celebrity friends as well who were your guest on the show
You have a home in LA we get that I get there but you will always have a home here in LA never forget with love
I grew up watching this show 😢 It’s the best late night show ever❤ Thank you James for everything!!! Definitely gonna miss youuu😢😢😢
😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Man I don't want you to go I'll miss you so much You're an enthusiasm to the late show please don't go we'll miss you I'll miss you in the bottom of our hearts
Where was Conan Obrien in that dream sketch!!!?
Good luck James.
You will be missed!!  bless you in your new journey in life.
Well done!  You will be missed!
Feels like James and Trevor is running from a house on fire :|
Finally he's gone
Help I’m so emotional, this show never failed to make me laugh or put me in a better mood and I loved to hear James sing always! The last song I just started crying 🤍🫶🏼 thank you for everythring James!!!
thank you for everything James ! bittersweet goodbye, there’s nothing like going home ❤
Thanks, James and Team.
Where's Conan ??? 🪞 Awwwwww !

Got me sobbing at 1 am, we will all miss you. Thank you for everything!
Oh my heart 💔 We love you James! Thanks for ending our days with laughter .. All the best to you and yours ❤️Xo
Show was losing $20m a year. Course the spend time with family narrative sounds better.
I loved the bit with the other hosts! As always the show comes up with the most comedic bits that have me laughing out loud. That last song though! Thank you to everyone in the Late Late Show with James Corden.❤
I was kind of hoping Craig Ferguson was gonna stop by
James, thank you and your amazing cast. Literally the positivity your show brought was contagious. Wish you and your family the best! Bitter sweet but you’re doing what’s best your family. Respect!
thank you so much to james! i’ll give thanks from japan!!!!
The end speech that he gave was so nostalgic and heartwarming 🥲
James is unbelievably TALENTED!
How boring. Tv sucks these days
is that women okay at 17:52
Such a class act! Thanks James!
I’m so sad
The first talk show being with my hard time in my life，I feel happy，because this show I felt in love with talk show！Thank you！James！
❤😢😢 it is sad to see the show go!!!!
You can seriously feel his energy and how much he loves and cares about his show, guests, and fans. Thank you for creating a fun show that was always entertaining to watch. But how did they rebuild the broken table so quickly 🤔 I guess that’s the power of Hollywood
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Craig ferguson is back?👹
Why is this show ending?
I love this guy. He is my favorite ❤
Im going to miss this show!
Why this is his last show?can someone please explain.
Thank you James for everything Thank you Thank you Thank you You made me cry and laugh at the same time I can't express my sadness nor my heartbreak The show is over It was my favorite show I will never forget this episode in my life Thank you James.
What a great show 😊 I had a lot of good laughs 😂🤣😂🤣 good luck to you James in whatever life takes you and your family back home in England 🇬🇧👏👏👏👏👏👍🇨🇦
😢thanks for your show I loved it the episode with u bringing the jonas brothers back was by far my favorite enjoy your next chapter James and all the staff

This is great knowing what a kind of asshole he is. He's so disgusting in real life but this is fun.
Wishing you all the best, James. It's been a pleasure having you here for the last 8 yrs. You will be missed.
Thank you so much James and co... We will be missing you a lot.. Best wishes for your life
This is problem my favourite late late show video
Biden can say a full sentence now damn
😢🙏🏼👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I will miss this show with all my heart 🤍I feel so lucky to have gotten to sit in audience last year...Wow am I sad to see this show end 🥹🤍 Thank you for all the memories 🤍Much love and luck with everything that follows 🤍
❣️❤️❣️James, you are the sweetest and funniest talk show host I have ever watched and a talented musician! Thank you for the 8 years of being real to the people and mostly to yourself! God bless you and your family. Love, Renee
Growing up watching this show was so great I'm so proud of you James.. love from India💗
Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooo. Why??? This was the only Late Night show that I really liked :( James Corden was so funny on the shows, and he is the only one who seemed genuine for his guests, kind and funny. I will miss this show :(
WHY are u and your family proud of the KIMBERLEY part of your name??? Bloody colonialists! Proud of your white supremacy!??
Good luck although I never cared for your show
Beautiful, and wish you all the luck young man!
ジェームズありがとう！ from Japan
Wishing you a long happy life. Thanks for the memories.
Well doesn't that just look gay as sh!+
The girl fainted when she fist bumped Harry lmao
The end of a amazingly goofy, beautiful era
I'm not crying you are ❤
WAIT THE WHOLE SHOW IS ENDING??!!!
I'm not crying. You're crying. I've been dreading the final show since I heard the news. I look forward to seeing James do more serious acting work as well. Such talent. Good on him for making the best decision for himself and his family(to go back home). I REALLY hope his show "Mammals" gets a Seson 2! 💕
CBS couldn’t afford the show as apparently it was a financial flop. Making $20 million LESS than what it cost.
You and your crew have been great James, Thank you for opening up your view to me!
What a very talented man and a very honest heart we will miss you and we love James 🙏🏻🌈🙏🏻🌈♥️♥️♥️
James!!! I have never been a huge TV watcher or a giant fan of talk shows, but yours was the most creative, entertaining and fun!! Thank you for creating a place for us to come and escape, and to watch our favorites having fun up there with you! we will miss you James, you are the Late Late show!!
Now they are on Hollywood strike lol
That much people working for one show?
James Corden has been one of my favorites since I used to watch Conan back in the late 90s early 2000s. His carpool karaoke was my favorite. He will be missed! He has very large shoes to fill. Good luck to whoever gets stuck trying to fill them. I wish James so much luck in his future endeavors and can't wait to see what his future holds. Hopefully much more time with his family ❤
Fuuuu will ferrel got old
Brilliant, like James! 🇬🇧
W Radiohead national anthem at the beginning
James, thank you for all the laughs, and great times that you provided in the show. I´m 22 years old, and I met you around my 14´s, so you´ve been part of nearly half of my years, and I really want to thank you ´cause you provided that light when I needed it the most, and you encouraged me to free myself in talking in english, and to do what I love the most: music, singing and making people around me happier. I learned a lot from you, so I´m really, really greatfull. Greetings from Mexico, Puebla, and all the best of luck in this new chapter of your life :D
Why is he shitty to his mom?
Thank you! It was a great show! And you are the best Host! ❤❤❤
Thanks to the entire team, you became my family even though I never met you, I just can't put in words what this show means to me. Good bye.
Thank you James Corden for spreading a bit of happiness and joy all around the world 💖 Can’t wait to see what you do next!
Is he really gone please let it be true.
5 minutes on a locked door bit.  He'll be missed
I absolutely love him
Thank you James Corden for making us smile with each episode, we love you infinitely. 🤧🥺
So all of a sudden people forgot how terrible this guy treat others specially servers.
Phew, got it done just before the WGA strike.
Fvfvv hat
Finally, It's over...
That actually is amazing for Joe to remember something. Its rare thing. Hahahaha
Bye James, Gone but Never Forgotten!!!  And on to whatever you're up to Next!!
Thank You James Cordon and Bon Voyage!
Ellen, Conan and now James. Definitely coming an end to an era. Hopefully Stephen, Seth, Jimmy and Jimmy stay just a little longer
James, you are very talented 👏  You will be missed
Im really sad because this is the last episode James you've been amazing thank u thanks to CBS and yh fuck off init ❤😅
I never watched it because in my country they don't broadcast it and also nowhere on the internet except youtube, but on YT I watched a lot of videos here and I'm sad that it's ending :(
Anybody see the girl literally pass out after harry walks out and they speak to each other !?
Thank you, James 😊 you will be missed ❤
I'm gonna say it, James is my favorite late night host!  Before him, it was Craig Ferguson!  Both not afraid to be weird and go outside of the box!
Geee,  all the guests are So Sweet......seem like best friends with him...Love..
Just proves that the masses are asses
Thank you James for the 8 years of top notch comedy!! You will be missed.
Nasty piece of shit when the cameras aren’t on him. Despicable human being.
It's going to be boring without the late late show crew
Ppl really think this is funny?
👌👌🤣🤣🤣😁😁😁♥️♥️♥️
Oh, that message from President Biden is soooo sweet!!🤩
Oh, funny beginning.thanks.....and Wow....sad....last show!!!😗
I gave a like for it finally ending.  Interesting that James starts the show off with all the people in the unemployment line.
It’s hard to watch this after finding out what a douche bag James Corden is. I used to really enjoy his bits. Hopefully a little taste of humble pie will set him straight
I'm not American but that's the only American show i everrr watched in my life simply because James Corden is AMAZIIIINGGG 💕 love him soooo much hope to see him again ✨
So glad you’re coming home 🇬🇧 so proud of you James ❤
Thank you, our dear sire, James Corden! ✨❤️
For the year or forever??
An absolute narcissist on display. He got a big break, why? Hard to tell. And got so full of him self, that this is it.
I LOVE YOU JAMES!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤
Going to miss this guy❤️
Good luck James and hope you and your family have a safe flight back to London   It was a shame that James never got to say goodbye to BTS 😢
I love that the angel number 1111 opened the door! 💖 Synchronicity is often a very wonderful sign! A few years ago a video appeared in my feed with 888 views (the number of abundance) under a crosswalk musical and it was the very first time I saw James. With as often as angel numbers lead me to wonderful things and people aligned with the universe I’m convinced it was a lovely sign from my angels -  because to laugh is divine and James has the best and sweetest sense of humour. Toddleragraphy was my absolute favourite! 💖♾🧘‍♀️🌸🦋✨ (I opened a video of Oprah the other day suggesting one of my favourite mantras “Life is always working out for me” and there were 3333 views. No joke!) I don’t believe in coincident.💖
Goodbyes are tough.
Good riddance 😂
Harry is so sweet and so sincere and so kind and when he hugs James it is so sweet and so sincere and so kind... And then Will Ferrel ruins it. Hugs to James.
Forget about the money issue. A great man! A spectacular show! We will miss you! It's not a goodbye James, but just a see you later...
Literally biden ruins everything
I WAS WAITING FOR JIMMY
W conan
The girl who passed out 17:51 after getting a fist bump is literally me 😭
I especially want to thank the band and crew for making me feel a lot better during Covid. The shows without an audience were the best. I wish you all well from The Netherlands. xxx
Never watched complete shows, but loved the bits i did! Best of luck James!
Now lets bring Craig Ferguson back :)
Why is an America audience always screaming at the top of their longs?? You cannot hear the show. It's insane.
HAHAHAHA THE SHOW ENDS AND TODAY THE WRIITERS STRIKE BEGINS, LOLZ THE IRONY
Thanks for the update on the proxy server that got Nat a date with me
Please.. just leave... maybe now biden will take you in the white house with his army of brainless influencers
Help. Nat is doing a blonde
Could you please send me your address and I'll send you a picture 🖼️
I can’t say how much I love you James, I really loved your shows, you are one of my favourite ones forever, I started to watch your show after BTS came to your show, and after that I became addicted, I really love your personality and everything, hope you all the best and success in future, you make me cry tonight :(

harry has such an iconic place on this show's history 🥺
Trevor Noah wants to take you out for dinner and a movie
I'm not crying; you're crying!
What an awesome last Late Late Show✌️🥰. I only wish I had watched more episodes 💔. Carpool Karaoke was always the best and James you’re a wonderful singer and musician ♥️. You are well loved and beautiful 🥰✌️😎💐💜
This show was absolutely brilliant.  Innovative, funny, intelligent and definitely a bright light at the end of each day.  James Corden is a treasure.  We'll miss you, James!
I will miss you a lot James😢 , this show was my favorite  , God Bless you!! This is not the end!! Bless to your family!
This was too emotional 🥲. We will miss you James ❤❤❤
Absolutely love James Corden, talented, real with a warm heart, thank you so much for adding fun in my life.
Who is this guy?Just kidding, I usually change from CBS to NBC after Cobert to catch Seth Meyers for his "Closer look"".Now I am kicking myself for not watching more Janes Corden.
What an amazing last show!! Having Harry and Will on was a great decision and super funny. Thank you for all the car pool karaoke that was the best and if your next gig doesn’t work out you could go on Britains Got Talent and sing cause you have an amazing voice!! Wishing you well with your next adventure!!!
😪..............................Im Gonna miss You .................Thx James.... For All   .
He has enough money so don't cry
From a 68 yr old, still working, for himself now, you've been a wealth of laughs... With the world full of angry decades-Propagandized people, you are able to pass off as not worth talking about.  Not sure that helped, but it was entertaining...
😭
James .... nobody cares.
Thank you for everything you and the team gave us ❤
長年お疲れさまでした。英語は少ししか分からないけど、いつも楽しませてもらってました。またいつかすぐにジェームズを見れるのを楽しみにしてますね!
Well. You won't be missed.
we never got James on his Cruise Ship😢
James, You Made America Better!!! God Bless You!!! You Will Be Missed!!!
James u are gem❤️
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 I  really hate good byes
Larry outfits are so horrible, I can't understand how he can't hire someone with an educated fashion sense.
Had the pleasure of meeting James Corden at a charity do once. He was surprisingly down to earth and VERY funny.
Gonna miss u James, best late late host ever! Definitely made me laugh when I needed it  most ❤
Thank you very much James! Love you! ❤️
Thank you so much for your show ! It was amazing ❤❤❤❤
I've never understood why people like to dislike JC. I enjoy him so much. Well played JC. May you thrive from here on in ✌️
Love from Hungary James! That was epic!  ❤
What happened to txt sugar rush ride video ?
thank you The Late Late Show for giving us so many nights of smiles and incredible interviews. Thank you James corden for your charisma and project that positive aura in each episode. It is not a goodbye but a see you later.
This show was amazing. The karpools, and the way to be updated with the world news.  I watch from Colombia 🇨🇴. You will be globally missed.
the bit with the last night hosts was hysterical, one of the funniest things i have ever seen..... and to top it off had Trever Noah and he performing on the masked singer!!!  Brilliantly funny!!!
He was the only person who could reunite one direction but now its over 😭😭
Why is this on my feed???
his staff will be happy that he is gone - at least the ones he bullied...
Finally
THANK YOU JAMES I LOVE YOU
Thank you for making me laugh so many times and for all the incredible 1D moments you gave us. It was a pleasure having you as a host 🙈🫶🏻 i wish you the best James, you will always be in our hearts forever and evermore. Favorite host of all time
One of a kind.
I'm seriously gonna miss this show. Well done on entertaining us all for 8 years. Congratulations, James x
Why has he given that up. It was the best gig. ❤
Good & Fun 8 years🥂🥂🥂🥂🥂🥂🥂🥂
Thank god its over
why everyone start watching this show after thier divorced
pushing the BUG NWO AGENDA
This sucks! I’ve always loved that he had my favorite artists who most people don’t know like QuinnXCII and Chelsea Cutler
I don’t care what nobody say I love James corden
split up ideas like PIZZA
Tim Allen just sent a greeting to James
We’re gonna miss Late Late Show so much!😢
❤❤
Did anyone notice the woman fainting after Harry Fist bumped her???
Terrível esses gritos do público .. enche o saco...
😢
bruh did no one notice the chick that passed out when harry gave her a fist bump😂
Hes got one thing right:Will absolutely crushed it
I'm in Iran and its very hard using these platforms but anyway I tried to watch this show I've found it so inspiring and I've enjoyed the time watching it .  I shall never forget that being creative always works .
What an amazing show. I will miss it dearly. Please come back James, we need your energy and inspiration. I loved every second of this show.
Show is over but memories will always stay❤
Loved it. Will miss it always
Me and my husband of now 32 years have enjoyed moments of smiles shared some of Mr. Corden's political opinions especially the abortion over turn. But all moments sad or happy or even when seemed he was going through the motions, my husband and I always seemed to feel the same way. I fully appreciate so much that even on days when you could tell the atmosphere was off everyone eager for a holiday or coming back from having family life or drama happen that they always pushed through that to demonstrate that even during those times you can still find a laugh somehow and so you don't let it drown you just do it. Find humor every day. care about others when you feel a way then listen to someone else. Some way to not let yourself carry negative baggage around with you like armor or as a bag of weapons to use against those around you. I liked his use of Bits Games and random YouTubes to deflect negativity from news or life or online stuff get his show and its crew down. He just made a statement about it identified the situation then quickly turned it around with humor compassion or even a random commercial that could be purposefully placed that was slightly light or funny. He will always be the light that taught us how to deal with our own grief of losing all 4 parents in the 8 years of his show. The loss of Obama and introduction to the past 2 presidents that are so different from Obama its not even easy to say President at times in comparison. I will miss this show. There is no replacement for it. He truly put something together that will never ever be duplicated or replicated even if rights to his side shows get bought by any network. James Corden is in every way imaginable not replaceable. He left for family and my husband and I watched this show for the sake of our family. we had to try to learn from some of the best comedy writers and  Mr. Corden, himself, how to find a way to laugh be joyful in moments of grief strife struggle that are all apart of family life. So "Hats off waving as you fly away to UK Mr. Corden we thank you forever but know it isn't even enough times to show how much you did for our 32 year old family." Enjoy every day you get with your parents while you have them here on Earth. You made the best choice. You are right; no amount of money can replace a single hour of joy with family.
I will miss the fatty
I wish he was this nice in real life
James,You Are a Bright,Bright Light not Only for America!! But your Home country as well,having been Born American My Blood ,My Heritage Is 50 % British,and rest Scottish,German Irish So European I am Proud of My Heratage I'm 62 almost I always Dreamed of Going to Britain 🇬🇧 Idk? If I'll ever be able But I Just wanted to Say... I'm Proud of My Fellow British/ American That's would be You James!! You are Just a Great Soul And Funny as Shit!! Love ya you will be Terribly Missed Don't stay away too,Too long From your 2nd Home which will slways be AMERICA!!! 🇺🇸🇬🇧XXOO
He is mostly despised in the uk.
Oh what a character, and oh what a creation.... if I could reach the peak of my being, I might think I'm in heaven.... James, you have reached a pinnacle in your journey, only God knows how far you still have to go. Keep on climbing high. ❤❤❤
THIs was a piece of unique television history with that swan song ending and going out the curtain for the last time.. Congratulations on a GREAT RUN..
Britons can’t stand this guy….they were just so glad to be rid of him…
No way this started with the fucking National Anthmen by Radiohead xd
🤣

Thank you and good night James!
Jimin is  going to miss you ❤
Love ya James! TRUMP 2024 🎉
Cool
The worst man on the planet is gone. I’m devastated
Did you get fire?
thank god...
Thank you for the good times that you made me pass during the lockdown
I still remember James in The Wrong Mans. Put him on my radar as a very funny man. He is hilarious and very very clever. A comedic genius and I love him.....in a very manly way.
My heart broke
Amazing. Such a great show (the only late night show I liked) can be LOSING MONEY???
Lovely seeing present & former hosts  coming together to support James. Kindness goes beyond jobs. TY all for your work!
first of all all 3 of you are legends anyway so you don't have to do anything. you've already given us so much over the years. just bringing me joy seeing you together.  if i was james corden I would have done this  carpool karaoke to the show (Including will and harry)  then spill fill guts at arrival (Including will and harry)  then have some funny live skits w fallon, Kimmel, corden including harry and will  then have a musical with harry, james and ferrell singing   harry performing signs of times and telling 1d reunion is happening! (nice one it happened lets go!)
Wow! 😥😥😥❤❤❤
Way to end a show!! 😍 Thank you James for making the best years of our lives!
Good Riddance! Never thought he was funny
17:51 wtf did that girl faint after fist bumping harry LOL
😅too funny
Amazing! What an honor!  The late great James Corden everybody.
Can’t stop loving HARRY😭
I was hoping for a very last special news jingle 😢 Gonna miss you guys
❤
Thanks for all the fun and entertainment james. Will miss you buddy!

No matter how good you are if you stay for too long, you will end up loosing it. A good dancer must know when the vacate the stage. All the best James
Thank you so much, ❤James and the team. Best wish to y'all.
This guy sucked, did he not?
I Miss Harry so much, and James invited him to his last episode, i can't believe it!!!
Tbh I haven't been watching a lot lately but I'm kinda shocked it's ending already right now. And whatever other people think, I kinda grew up with this show and had some good times. It's one of the few talk shows that I watched.
They should have never let Craig go he was the best Sid and Geoff was the best
💛💛💛
💛💛💛
Putting all late night show hosts in the same room was BRILLIANT !!!! I wanted this to happen so bad ! EDIT : they should have concluded the show with Craig Ferguson the GOAT who started it all
Tou should keep the show going . Its a great show.   Why is it the last show?. Just moving on to new things ?
Your show sucks I can’t believe it lasted this long
All that bloody screaming ... STFU for at least five minutes
Happy you're gone
🫡
❤ I am so going to miss u love the car karaoke and videos of stars you are very funny and cool 😂 😎 🤗😘😊💜
I am still obsessed with the fact why James choosed Harry for his last episode? This shows how much 1D lads meant to James.
Bye!
Thank you James! You have brought so much joy thru this tremendously amazing show !!! You will be missed ! All the best on your future endeavors 🥰🥰🥰
Legend!

Потрясающий, душевный человек

Harry takes him back home...
That was a fabulous finale .. and the heart felt lyrics of the song were wonderful .. such a lovely touch to end the show on. ✌💜💙💜💙
I had been using some of the Late Late Show clips in class when teaching English listening class.  I have also encouraged my students to watch your clips.  Thank you for all the joy and happiness that the whole crew brought us.
Thank god its over! Bloody hell what a constant stream of falsities and nonsense. Ive always felt my life would be easier if I was a corden fan because Ive always thought life would be much simpler if I was a vegtable.
❤😢🙏
Thanks for all the laughs and memories James and late late crew 😇
Will miss you james
Thank you for finally leaving the show 🎉
Bye
We GoNnA miSs YoU😢

😭Perfect Ending!! Thank you for your all James.  You will be missed 🎉
Omg we will miss you James❤️🥺
The best since letterman my opinion

Clean the Toilet! 🚽🌟
Thank you James. Those eating crazy stuffs were hilarious.

i wish he did the speech from wolf of wall street “and that’s why i’m not leaving”
My favourite show i will miss him😢
Thank you james,for being an amazing host, thank you for the laughs,good luck buddy🙏🙏🙏🙏
wait am I the only one that noticed what happened at 17:52?? 😂😂😂 I'm on the floor
Well said James about our unity. 👏👏👏👏👏 Thank you for that and for the laughter 🤣🤣
This is my first favourite TV show and followed it on my YouTube channel the first EP I watched was when I was doing my pre-graduate research in 2016 and this show made me feel stress-free and happy every time I watched it :) and really Thank you for making me happy and being my friend every moment
This show was one of the few things that stayed constant my entire life, it was a liferaft for me in the hardest times. Thank you for that.
I love how short James is😭😭❤️❤️
The last 15 minutes is just straightup crying
It means incredibly much when harry styles claimes you a safe space to him, yet that he is sexualised and stigmatised and people cross his boundaries wherever he shows up.
Its an honourable thing to go home to UK to raise your kids .... Karaoke CarPool will never be better than you did it .... and your Tom Cruise pieces made me love Tom again and were so very brave of you and so so very funny. God speed to the UK James... well done you James.  It would be so hard to leave your team and I hope too that they go on to roles that they want to do and love....
Now what? Own show in UK?
the ending song was beautiful 🤍
You went woke, what did you think was going to happen?
Americas loss is Englands gain. Enjoy your life James we will truly miss YOU 💕💜💕
Nooooooooooooooo!!! 😥😢😭😭😭🤮 Why James, WHY!!!?!?
😢😢this show was so funny and uplifting. James a rare talent. Thanks James and your crew❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉
I'm happy for you and your family, but you should stay, James.
Will love this show always
tear fest 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Thank you for all the awesome memories! You are all that and a bag of chips ❤🤗 I wish you  love light and lifetime of happiness! 😘🙏🏻
Thanks for 8 years of the fun entertainment James... Good luck for anything you do next!
not me wanting to bust that door open because Harryyyyyyyyyy!!!!!!
Everyone will miss you James
So long James, you were absolutely one of the funniest faces on TV , Going to miss you bro ...
Why was conan not in the late night hosts bit :(( Need some Conan appreciation here!!!
Thank you so much. Good luck!!
Thank you James!!🎉🎉
I will miss you James……….you made me laugh.   I love the Sidewalk Musical’s.  They are great.
Aww, we'll miss you. Thank you so much James and Crew that made this, The Great" Late Late Show it became. What will we now do without you? 💖😔💫
Good riddance 😊
Fat Freemason Tosser
Bye
Lol, Im just finding out Harry was from One Direction.
Wow this was way grosser then I thought I didn’t realize he was a pedi too!!!
I refuse to accept this was the last last last show 😭
NO WAY IM CRYING
Always entertaining and very talented.  Appreciate the joyous moments.  Will miss watching. All the best for your future endeavor!
A charming English guy starts in the US in the shark tank of American talk shows. This must go wrong. No chance ! That is the opinion of many experts. But this guy is nice, can hold interesting conversations, can sing, is reserved, always up for a joke and a good gag. Logically .. because the base was also a nice and funny family. The laugh of the mother was unique! James is accepted by all important people and big stars. During this time he has gained high position and placement on American talk shows. And now he's done. He stopped the show and at the right time for him in my opinion. I think we'll see him again. We have a new show in a new place and a lot of new highlights. greetings from Germany
Good luck enjoy yourself with your family, the best show ever .I going to see you again tha for sure.
thank you so much for making us laugh and this 8 years has been amazing and good luck for coming future god bless you
I miss him! I'll miss his show always! I LOVE & HAVE LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT HIS LATE LATE SHOW! I MISS YOU JAMES CORDEN!!!
My dad always thought that the CIA assassinated JFK, they had Jack Ruby who had terminal cancer  shoot Oswald to clean up loose ends.
All because some network exec felt thier profits wasn't big enough 😢 America 💁🏼‍♂️🇺🇲
The reason I dislike James Corden is because he’s a dead ringer for Martin Luther.
Incredible ❤
I can't stop laughing and crying too. I'll miss this show so much! Thanks James for being a relief for me when I was down!
Will miss you corden!!
Good riddance
Damn James, thanks for the great great show !!
it's enough to make a grown man cry
Another divisive celeb that talks out the side of their mouth about unity & working together while bashing conservatives
I’ve watched this show since i was a middle school student. I was happy to watch your show! You made me laugh and gave happy memories good luck James🍀
This show is and have been amazing! James you have made us smile and laugh so hard. I am happy your taking on new things, all the best!
Cried with the last Carpool Karaoke with Adele and this final episode was no difference. You better have your show in the UK! I'll be watching!
Bawling 😭 thanks to the late late show
sitting here crying at 1am... ill miss this show...
I like this show. He would ask questions to celebrity's but it would be a game and he had to play as well
I have never seen any of his shows....but  best  carpoole  was  when  he  was  with Paul  McCartney   !!!  BEST  EVER   !!!  Good  luck  James...
I cried a whole bucket...James u are such an inspiration
I cried so much watching I love James and gonna miss watching the show it has brought me so much happiness and laughter. We will miss you so much James ❤
smashing that desk looked so therapeutic for harry
The first late night show I loved as a non US resident just because of Harry Styles. Congratulations and adios to all of the staff and crew. You did well. I'm gonna miss this show.
The speech at the end was so beautiful and humble and true. Thank u for that!!
Wake up America, you have hit your debt ceiling for printing money, THE WORLD is about to dump the dollar as reserve currency, the GREAT AMERICAN DOLLAR is going to be worthless soon.   The only options you have is to keep starting wars and conflicts so that you can sell your weapons. CHOOSE BETTER LEADERS.
😢😢😢😢😢. Why am I crying?
totally a different person in real life. sorry to say
I want him back!!!
The last bit was sad. 🥹
So sad, no more funny James Corden...
Sad the franchise has ended because of this annoying twat. Craig Ferguson done So much for this show and format...only to seemily be forgotten by brain dead Corden "fans" worst host of the late late show cant Stand him.. the way he screams and flaps his hands around. Hes literrly un able to speak without flapping his hands around. Corden will be forgotten soon enough but when he is remember...itll be how terrible he was ....even Kilborn was better....
Thank u for all the wonderful conversations on carpool karaoke,amazing pedestrian concerts and the crazy spill ur gutz! ❤
Amazing man, good person, we need more many men like him
JamesCorden, one and only. Will miss u. Thank u for introducing BTS to me
I'm gutted they never did the late late show on a cruise.
I will definitely miss James for sure....his show is very much entertaining from carpool to nasty foods to interview and so forth....😢❤🎉🎉🎉
Thank you CBS, James Corden and the late late show team for entertaining us, one of the best tv shows :) ❤
I hope the staff all can find a Job and good luck to the staff... Also I love at the beginning where he's high-fiving everybody and acting like he's friends. But man, I wonder how many people there were  forced to act like he was good to them, he probably didn't know their names.  The ones he did know he probably treated like crap. Atleast going  by what his staff said about him before his show was canceled..
até mais
The fact that the views at the moment I saw this 3:11 were 4,568, 821
we really miss u james , in last last show ....thank u for every funny moment.  ..... stay well 🥰🥰❤‍🩹❤‍🩹🧡❤🖤🤍🤧🤧
Awwww😢 that was a good show
Thank you James Corden! All the best to you in your new journey!
what about billie?
i will miss you
Great era of entertainment!
"You're embarrassing your country" too true, all us english can't stand him, why you Americans have to choose the most talentless, spoilt, annoying & undeserving when theres millions of other British who deserve it, henry cavill, harry styles, David beckham, tom holland, arctic monkeys and literallt every other british
Thank you so much to James and the entire Late Late crew. The show came into my life about 7 years ago, I was in a very dark place. But quickly became a fan of James and fell in love with the show. I have made so many friends and memories over the years from other lovers of the show over at Twitter, sharing our love in this public forum. So thank you for everything! And we wish you and your family all the best back in the UK James xx
Thanks Nate!
Fantastic man indeed
thank you so much for everything !!!
Good luck,,, hope we see you in another show 😢😢😢❤❤❤❤
Thank you James and your team for a great ride! Best of everything to you and your family.❤
thru ups and downs 8 years of my life, The Late Late Show with James Corden and Carpool Karaoke clips has been there for me! I just want to thank everyone in the team for sending joy all over the years as you all will be incredibly missed! i literally cried and my mind still can't accept the end of James Corden in these shows :(
Loved his serious message about the world, and his song at the end.  A side I hadn't seen before. Man of great values and talent. I only recently discovered him on YouTube and so sad I can't watch any live shows anymore.  What a great era he had!
I am going to miss you all the good guests and your kareoke will miss you love from Florida ❤❤❤ you’re welcome in the USA😢
This was it 22:05
I made sure to click on this in a way that doesn't actually add any view count.  Later loser, don't let the door hit your ass on the way out.
Much love  & appreciation for you.  Thank you for making us smile. ❤
Why retired
Thank you so very very much for the opportunity of sharing your brilliant talents.  We can't thank you enough.  We are missing you already and WHEN WILL YOU COME BACK TO LATE LATE NIGHT SHOW AGAIN ❤
Was he really playing the piano?
Going to miss you, JC!  😞
Thank James for how you honored those you worked with and your very important words to us as Americans!  Well Said!  Well Done!  Thank you CBS, the writers, the producers and every person behind the scenes for creating such great content!  Well Done!  I wish you all well!  I look forward to the new things that will happen for all of you!
Yc j k k
I know you probably won’t read this but if you can get Greta van fleet to come and do a carpool karaoke it will be the most chaotic and fun event ever🎉
Love that Will knew the scales for model rails. Maybe was set up but still funny.
Thanks for everything
God bless you James Cordon ❤
I knew I was going to cry. Huge THANK YOU for having the entire final show available. Know that you brought joy, and laughter to these crazy Americans, who couldn't sound english if they tried.
I’m seriously going to miss this show. Who’s going to give us car karaoke now!? I mean, I feel like I could do it… but not sure it would get as many views 😂😂
I wish they had Conan in this bit, so bad.
I've retired from a school or two in the past and it's always emotional to leave something you've done for a long time and grow relationships with people. Not been a huge Corden fan but he's lovely. Be well out there.
Hmm..I never seen his show...
Good luck James in your future endeavors I've had a.lot of laughs and fun with you helping me make it through tough times thanks again
Jimmy Fallon would kill the carpool karaoke
Thank you James ❤
Can we just appreciate how good that guitar solo was at the end??
no.... i can't accept thisss Jameessss,, come baaaaccckkkkk
I just love him, he is so funny, I watch the religiously. I have never laugh so much, as with james and all his crew , I can't wait to see what's next ❤
🇬🇧 over u.s. ANY DAY!
Thanks for all the wonderful years and I am ready for the follow up series of Gavin and Stacey! Did you say yes to Ness?
What a waste of 4 minutes of my life watching the most retarded start to a show. Sorry but that door code trick is not even funny

Can't wait for Jame's next project
When Will Ferrel started singing As It Was it was SUCH a perfect opportunity for Harry to be like "I'm panicking cause he's gonna steal my job"
❤😢😢 will mis you James
Everything about him is so fake. Even the at the start you can see all the people acting like "This is so awkward."
Finally got rid of the biggest prick in TV history!
We'll miss you, James!
Thank you for bringing joy to my life way before even this show, thank you for taking care of Harry whenever he needed you, joy doesn’t come into my life very often but you never let me down. I know that what is coming next for you will be incredible. You deserve all the love and success that will continue to come your way!
Best host ever. Always positive. Always funny. Always genuine. Best of luck James and crew.
Okay but like let’s be real if anyone should take over carpool karaoke it should be Jimmy Fallon 😂  I’m going to miss watching them 😭
❤ James has heart. Will miss this show. Well done, mate.
The way harry dresses is haram
And to think it all started with George..
It feels like just yesterday I watched the training montage for James to become a host. This show was also such a fun experience for me to watch. Gonna especially miss cross walk musical and spill your guts or fill your guts. But over all I will miss you James!😢
THANK YOU for the best show ever. Don’t know what I will do without you and carpool karaoke 😢
We’re gonna miss you😭 so much
We will missed you ❤️❤️❤️
Hope he stay in the usa
sorry, when I see this "loveable guy", I keep reminding myself of his berating the staff at that particular restaurant in New York
This show needed to go.
Thanks for everything James !
Thanks so much to James and the whole team of bringing so much happiness to my life. To James, you were emotional when thanking your parents in the episode one, I was watching and hoping you can succeed in the late night space. And you did it so well, I will miss the show so much. Wish you and your family all the best, thank you for making our life happier
What a ride. I will miss all the content especially Carpool Karaokes <3 <3 <3  Love from Denmark <3
Broo this was my heart,the world will never be the same again. I'll always be thankful towards this show and hiw the simple laughs carried me through the most difficult trails. Thank you soon much late late show❤

Your Prouders know we all love Willy P but we came for you too James 😂😢
That was a first class show ending. Thank you James and staff!!
The show was actually cancelled by CBS. It was not sustainable..... I will miss Carpool Karaoke.
😢
That thumbnail has Harry Styles lookin' like a hunched-back old woman.  All he needs are glasses wih a pearl chain.  Ohh, and he's wearing an elderly woman's outfit from 1986.
Questions since its Over Did anybody else not like his head band Guy...I mean i dont Hate him ...he just never gave me a reason to enjoy him 🤷🏿‍♂️😂
It's see ya later, celebrating 8 years of great times. Wishing you the best for ypu and your family ❤
I can't believe it's really over 😢. I love James Cordon. No one will ever fill his shoes, ever. I am so sorry to see you go, James, but I do pray this isn't goodbye. You are too charismatic to stay away from entertainment. It's in your blood. So, for now, see you later, my friend.
That's what a Tonight Show Host, RARELY says! You ROCK, JAMES!
This show has been shit ever since Craig Ferguson left.
4:53  that is how you open a  show!
🎶Don't leeeeeave us Jamesss....please stay with us Toniiiiiiight!🎶
Ohh I'm going to miss James but all my good vibes to him and his family. Regards from 🇵🇦 Panama ❤
Brasil ❤❤❤❤❤

Legendary.
Wonderful! I love you Games, may you and your family be very happy. you are a charming person. ❤️
“Passcode is 1111.”   Of course it is.  Actually 1-2-3-4 is the most common passcode.   People are so trusting.
Can you please explain what Will said about their country that Harry got shocked? I didn’t get it 27:58
Thank God you are off the air
Hope u will stay this way n will not become Ellen
Oh James…. I liked your show more than any other… looking forward for your new projects… good luck ❤
❤
You can always count on good old Haz!❤❤❤
Great human being and great show I will miss him and I wish him all the best thank you james
17:51 🫣
17:46: The girl who bump-fisted Harry Styles was so flabbergasted, she fainted 😭
Woo!!!
Hopefully he can come back to late night later on in life.
I'm looking forward to see what you come up with for your future, thanks for every laugh <3<3<3
Welcome Home James 🇬🇧 You Made The Right Decision Lovely To Have You Back Home 😊
Thank you for breaking out in song and dance every chance you got.  It showed me that my soul's deep desire to do so wasn't weird or wrong.
Enjoy your next chapter James 🎉❤

Thank you James ❤️
Take a bow, James, take a bow.  You’ve brightened my life so many times, in so many ways. Thanks to everyone for so much.  I can’t tell you alla what this show meant for me through the pandemic, as well as many other times. Thanks for introducing me to so many wonderful people, and for letting me get to know many people better. I appreciate and echo your final thoughts — let’s all look for what unites us long before we look for what divides.  Thanks again
America’s gain is the UK’s loss.
Thank god It's over but would miss the Carpool karaoke
james has bisexual energy and I love it
To many dislikes
Wokeism farts🤣🤣🤣
An amazing 8yrs but god his acting is still terrible.
Thank you James welcome home 🇬🇧 keep your home in LA though the weather is miserable here. Love you ♥️♥️

"And then there was the late late show... with the most unique guy I have ever known, James Corden..."
I'm really gonna miss this show. Good luck to you and whatever you do from here on out.
I cannot believe how much I actually cried watching this.
Who is that woman that keeps screaming?
Please come to Canada. There are not as many NAZIS here.
He has truly been like a light in dark times. I love this show. One could really feel that they wanted to make people laugh and not only about making money
What happen😮
Harry's Golden Golden,,,❤❤❤
😢
your show will be always in my heart. thank you for doing it. I enjoyed every second of it. this show meant everything to me and to everybody who watched It, thank you truly xx ATL.
Thanks for the laughs, K
I am so sorry to see you go, James. You were the very bedt of the best host they ever had. It is not a smart move on the network's part. I can't stand their other 2. In fact, I wanna puke when they come on. I immediately change the channel. But your show is such an inspiration. I look forward to what you'll do next. You are simply such an incredible talent!
It's so emotional to know that it's their last show 😢
I’m crying🥹😭 Thank you!! You guys changed everything for the better🙏❤️
I can’t believe this is ending. Going to miss u James

If there is one person that deserves such a loved and honoured ending, it's you. I wish more people looked at you and got inspired to be kind. You will be missed♡
Who's the one that looks like Mr. Burns from The Simpsons?
must say..  I loved the people I met in America, as a British man you think its false until you experience it first hand. Have a nice day! ha ha ha
Obsolete,  why 😮 Canadians! Absolutely
awww.. its a sad time! can you please do a take on carpool karaoke on youtube in the uk James please!?
I'M GOING TO MISS YOU JAMES CORDEN! YOU CAB KARAOKE! BLESSINGS TO YOU AND YOUR FAMILY!
Thank you and all of your team that making a great show. You entertain us nearly a decade so it's time to give it back to your family. Good luck for the next chapter of your life James, you will be one of my favourite Late night host. Nothing but the best for everyone who growing up watching James and all of late night shows. I love you all even we are from the other side of the World. After Ellen's quitted and now you, sometimes it's heartbreaking us but life goes on. Let's spread love and positivity <3
This show always makes me sad because it replaced Craig Ferguson
that pos is still on?  ....thought that crap went off the air years ago
Undoubtedly James and his amazing Team have accomplished a lifelong dream that will forever be remembered by all of us! Thank you for bringing light to our lives! It has been an absolute joy to watch you every single time!  We love you James and all of your Team!
I was here,,,
WOW !  BEAUTIFUL song performance by James Corden ending the Late Late Show .👍❤😢 Met  #2023
Can't believe this show is really ending, so so greatful and happy i got to know this show, THANK YOU JAMES!
First was Conan and now James Corden, wish things don't end.
this show has cheered me up soooo many times and especially during times when i felt my worst. i can’t thank you enough!
wow that song at the end has made me sob 🥺🥺
Dear James, thank you so much for this important message about joy and “we are all more the same than we are different…”🙏❤️❤️❤️
Fuck he made me cry 😂
England has national health care and is overall much safer in terms of shooting deaths,  good move he's doing going back.
I'm gonna miss the crosswalk musicals and the carpool karaoke
I am sad that his show has ended, but appreciate the reason he wanted to end- to spend more time with his family.  Thank you for all the great laughs and creativity!  Can't wait to see your next venture!!!
❤
Best Late Night show ever!! And I only found out about it in 2021 through YouTube. I'm so glad I found it, it's really helped make me feel better over these years!! Looking forward to what James does next!
harry is beyond AMUSED 😂
so what now ..?
Why did you go ahead and ruin your show with Joe. Speaking??????? Totally bummed me out. That killed it.
Cried and laughed! I’m so sad he’s leaving for good but so glad for all the wonderful memories!! My favorite Late Show!
James corden ❤

The final episode? So he woked up and got cancelled?
The nightmare is over
I think it's time to drop a huge thank you to james cordon since through watching his shows and the carpool karaokes espcially I learned english which my former english teacher dismissed as impossible - so thanks james ❤
Come back, we need more Gavin and Stacey 😂
Mama in tears right now💔💔
off to Gitmo too 🤣🤣🤣
I am gonna miss this show so much :(
Im sorry, but can anybody tell me why he ended it?
He used to be the most beautiful musician. Now 😢😢😢 nothing from the guy you don't know if he is men or women
Bravo James and Team!!!👏👏👏❤💔
We will miss this show James❤  Lots of love and respect to you!!❤
Thank god it’s finally over. CATS was the magnum opus of this man’s career, and I’m glad everybody saw his true potential through that.
In tears. Best show over. Well done James Corden
the song at the end was so beautiful
Just right.  I wish I had watched all of them.
Stay lovely bro.. we love your and respect
this was beautiful
finally.
Thank you bro james❤
17:48 look at the girl blacking out after harry fist bump with her😮👍🏻✨
We love you Brother's ❤❤❤❤❤❤  from Sweden 🇸🇪
Sure am going to miss this show!!! Please come back and do other shows
That is a very hard decision😢 he loves what he does, but he is leaving his job for the love of his family. I hope his wife and children appreciate the sacrifice
Well, James, that ruined it for me when you brought Biden on. Really, he's not amazing, he's ruined this country.
I'm hoping James will continue carpool karaoke on YouTube
felt like loosing one direction again
1111? luv it!
thank you, kinda see what my dream could be if it happened. Thank You James
Love the farewell song, it kinda summarized the good memories James will take with him back in London and treasure in his heart for keeps. All the best in your future undertakings Sir James Corden.
Oh James you will be missed.. from Canada
A BIG THANK YOU JAMES!!! ❤️
finally, fuck!
They could’ve included Conan O’Brien when the showed the hosts 😒
What a journey it has been❤❤
That intro was actually really funny 😂😂😂😂
Thank you James for all the wonderful showsss youve given us..🎉🎉🎉🎉One of the best!!!!
Any idea why it ended ? Jack Parr, Johnny Carson, Jay Leno and now it ends?  Political correctness run amok!
😢😢I cried the whole freaking show! He was the best host ! We’ll miss you !!
I love this show, truly. And I am going to miss it. But did anyone else see that girl faint at 17:51 after fist-bumping Harry?
-Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.   (1 John 5:21) -The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?   (1 Corinthians 10:16) -This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.   (1 Timothy 1:15)
<3
I sure will miss this show.
Never really cared for this dude
No Conan? 😱 😁🤣
No ers necesario que james lo acabara. Pero es su decision
No Conan!? Damn he got screwed out of a job again
What an amazing way to end the show. Thank you so much James and everybody from the crew for all the memories. It has truly been a light in moments where everything felt dark. It has been amazing and I can't wait to see what you do next!
Thanks for the wonderful moments you   are différent, and special  stay we you are and enjoy your life. Bisous ❤❤❤
Bye my friend.  Thanks for all the great memories. <3  You'll be remembered and missed. Enjoy your return home.  America loves you.
Will all those people loose thief jobs
Ive heard many times that absolutely  everyone working on the show cant stand james😂 literally everybody
I love you James Corden!!❤
This is so emotional 😮😮😮😮thanks for making is happy 😅😅😅
This made me cry, thank you James and crew. ❤
Thank you James for years of laughs and fantastic moments. Much love and wish you the best with your future endeavors!
Finally the shit show is ending
Thank you for 8 great years
OMG! I teared up more watching this last week than I did when any of my own co-workers left, haha. My late nights, sad times and British friend desire (haha) will truly miss his humor, but I’m happier to have had him for this time then not at all.  I wish him, his family and the whole team nothing but the best, and I can’t wait to see what’s next!
Great, can we have Craig Ferguson back now???
James should be next prime minister of UK
Thank you James! You will be missed
Well done James
I struggle to watch this because I can't believe this!? I is a manipulative abuser
さみしい、、、😭😭😭😭😭大好きだったよ😭❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
buy James Corden, and thanks! hope you'll come back soon with new project
This gonna be history. I know is selfish to ask you to stay but your decision is understandable. Hope to see you be active in other field soon.
Hasn't this dude been saying its his last show like for a Year already??😂😂
I really haven't understood the bad press James has gotten. He seems to have a lovely relationship with his team.
All of those people he listed in the end song that work for him, hate him.
Good riddance. I hate that guy.
Damn, this really made me emotional. Loved him and will still love him and all these people.
The same month JC started, I was laid off a job of 9 years, went through a traumatic breakup and had to move back home. It was awful. Late Late Show was such a comfort as I slept on parents couch for months until I could stand on my own. All the late nights are my favs (esp Seth I'm sorry 😂😂), but this one hits different and it's been a staple comfort I've relied on for all the difficulties we experienced. I've since moved out, got some jobs, got married... and currently going through a divorce this month! LOL (we're still friends, it's all good still sucks tho). I know it's just one of those things that remind us that part of life is going through change whether we're ready or not.. Selfishly no longer having my comfort show to watch on the couch (in my own home this time) is such a blow lol but truly so happy for James he's talked about going back for years. What a career! A million thank yous for all the good times and your infectious kindness 💖💖💖💖
Thank they lord! GOOD FUCKING RIDDANCE!
I wish you did have it from Trump
Did he get fired or does he want to quit and how long has he been doing this???
I love this show 😭😭😭😭😭 keep doing comedies, James Corden!
Pleaaaaase dont stop.. Youre PERFECT, and AMAZING 😢❤
James has been a joy to watch! Wishing him all the best!
😢 the song was incredible and made me teary eyed. Thank you james corden and late late night show.
BRING BACK CRAIG FERGUSON
Seth Myers’s is the correct answer, thank you Will.
I've got to say that must be one of the best endings to a TV show ever So well done
Ding dong the witch is dead
I wil dearly miss you Mr. James Gorden! You made LA and the US a better place all these years! I will be watching you on YouTube whatever you will be doing! BEST OF LUCK! 😍😀🙃❣❤❤‍🩹💝💖💞💜💘💔
I can remember thinking when they got a replacement to succeed Craig Ferguson back in 2015 like 99.999% of America did…who is this guy James Corden? And he’s British!?! How’s this supposed to work? Never mind the fact that Ferguson was born in Scotland and has a wee bit of a Scottish accent and so we’ve already been getting our American late night talk show comedy from a Brit…I for sure thought well this is about to be a disaster. Talk about shaking up the late late night landscape! James took a minute to find his footing but every week, month and year he was getting better and better and soon James’ show went from oh that show I might catch if I’m up late. To that show I gotta stay up late to watch because I love James and his bits, skits and singing shit. James made late night fun and interesting and more like you were watching conversations than interviews. I’m going to miss James and Reggie and the whole late late night show crew but at least I got to experience that magic for 8 years and for that I am eternally grateful!
Why would it be last? 😢 The only show that I always watch.
Can't belive the Late Late Show ended I'm so sad 😢
I am going to miss you and your show.  I loved it so much.  good luck in your next endeavors.
Thank god its over, James Cordon was an embarrassment to all humans. Stealing bits from other shows here with Peep Show stuck in the hallway bit. Stealing jokes from Conan. Being rude to everyone bhs and those poor restaurant workers.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. CANT WAIT WHAT YOU WILL DO NEXT! Love you, thank you! 💋💗
Whyyyyyyy whyyyyyyyy whyyyyyyyyyy
Thank you 🙏🏽
I’m not crying you are…
Why it has to end 😢
Im not crying, you're crying.
Im going to bet he will end up a guest on a late night show in the future! 😊 Thanks for making us all smile n laugh James, you stole our hearts with your talent and youll be missed so much! Youre a gem of a guy!
Holy sh!t Reggie, what an outro!
Alright I’m watching this again
THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU ALL OF YOU THANK YOU✨💙💙💙💙
WTFF MY TEARS ARENT STOPPING HELP!!😭😭😭😭😭
James Corden has such a great personality. I love him and the Late Late Show has always made me happy. May he still entertain us. We love you, James Corden and everyone on the show!
Feels like death of America with you leaving. My favorite show and host...love n blessings to you n yours James! 😢❤
James really is my fave host , thank you so much for making us laugh and cry. Good luck!
This guy is a loser. He is a different man when the cameras are not on. Treatment of restaurant workers is pathetic
John Oliver was missing
Dear, dear James, thank you for all the tears you dried, laughs you created, smiles you put on our faces, and so much more. Thank you for being the one who we can trust blindly. Thank you for this wonderful show that sadly came to an end. No matter what you will be doing after this, we will support you fully in your decisions. You make us the happiest we have ever been. Okay you made us cry sometimes, but that was mostly out of laughter. You never failed to put a smile on our faces. This show was definitely home to some of us. We have great memories to look back to and we will never ever forget them. Thank you so much for being yourself in this show. Thank you for never making your guests feel less comfortable or unhappy. They always leave the show with a smile. Just like we watch these video's. All the video's live in my head rent free, from the Carpool Karaokes to the tattoo roulette with one direction. From the escape rooms to the rip offs. We will never forget them nor will we forget you. Thank you for everything. All my love, Bieke x
Thanks for the laughs James. I'll miss you. Best of luck. Maybe Britan needs a late late show.
Paid clappers.. lol
And yes, it's time to go home!!!
I can only watch this show on YouTube, I live in the uk, James and the show never fail to impress, entertain and share so many laughs, what a special soul this man has, thank you James ❤
THANK YOU SO MUCH
Good night🎉
Wishing him and his beautiful family the best and overall...lot of health ❤
23:34 l LOVED THE QUESTION HARRY HAD😢😢❤❤
Ty.    💞💯💫😘
ABSOLUTELY AMAZING
Idkwhy but Harry gives Me an off vibe idk hes kinda gross butok
Why is he leaving? If he loves it so much and everyone loves him I don’t get why he’s leaving. I’ve clearly missed something here. Can someone fill me in? Genuine question 🙋🏻‍♀️
why so many dislikes?
I’ll miss u James!!💓
James😭💓
Hey, CORDEN! Are Colbert and Myers talented? WHAT!!!?? Giants!!! But let's face it...the Jimmys have taken what, 75 years of late night American TV greatness, to a new level!! So who are YOU!!!??? You're the lead face of Mt. Rushmore, THAT'S who!!!!!  Look at the love on the faces of your workmates. How would we know how beautiful and talented Reggie is if it weren't for our brother from another (country) mother to bring it to us (I'm American btw, duh!)?  THANK YOU for bringing truth, perspective, love, MASSIVE talent, entertainment and joy and FUN to US households like noneother in the Late Night space had EVER done. You rule, you rock, you DOMINATE in a class of world class  hall of famers. Good luck our brother, your departure is our loss. Love you forever
I've been crying the whole show😢 James...you've got me through my worst years of my life. I hope I see you again in something. Well done, James🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 we will miss you. Big hugs from Norway 🇳🇴
Bye.
Glad this fucking fever dream is over.
interesting
Thank god
The finale
I read an article by James about his decision to return to England.  One of his motivations was an aging family in England that he wanted to spend time with while he could.  Another was three young children that he didn’t want to raise in this country.   How far have we fallen as a country when someone as successful as James Corden chooses a better atmosphere to raise their children?  I hope we can rise above the damage MAGA has done to our country and return to a place to be proud of.  Best wishes to James and his family.  We will miss your humor.
Wish James every success in the future! I thought he was a fantastic host on a great show.
The screeching audience are a pain in the backside !!! Beyond irritating!
I am Australian… I am going to miss waking up every morning and coming to YouTube to watch the snippets and skits from the show 😢😢🥺🥺
God damn that speech made me get so emotional
I’ll miss the show 😢
The girls face after shaking Harry's hand is literally me.
Thank you so much CBS! Thank you so much James Corden. You never failed to give joy and laughter.  You are one of the reasons why I am in YouTube.
Wow!!! What a closing speech
James you're always the GOT
I find the irony in his final message to be mind boggling when for 8 years he preached the entire opposite
what a show it has been. love and dedication. thanks The Late Late Show
Why the last?
Blob
This can't be true, you are my favourite :( I wish you all the best! Love from Germany ♥
Cheerio. ❤
Thank you ❤ Glad you came to the USA. Sending HuGs ♥️ to you and your family! With best wishes! ♥️ You will be missed by this Fan! 😢 You are the BeST ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
why did end it?
Held it together what a pro! I bet there wasn’t a dry eye in the room ❤
We will miss you!!!! Why???
Timestamps where Harry apears: 3:47 17:45  :)
💚💚🍓🍒🍉
Wonder how long time it will take for Harry to regret that outfit. I had a set like that when I were 5. My parents called it a pyjamas. Pictures of me in it still haunts me.
Thank you James for making us smile and laugh during times when no-one else could. Good luck for future.
dammit it,it was one of my dreams to be hosted on this how by james , well i guess carpool karaoke wont be same anymore , well i am gonna meet him anyways but gonna miss this show so bad , i dont think i have ever liked any late late show except yours and trevor noha's
Thank god this guy is gone.
HARRAAAEEEEE❤
There are one specific person in the crowd screaming at a very annoying frequence

Finally at last a pain in the ass has gone

CRYING LIKE I'M LOSING A BEST FRIEND. DAMN. Thank you for everything, James and all the Late Late Show beautiful team. Cheers from Indonesia.
12:37am on CBS won't be the same without James Corden & The Late Late Show. Good luck to the people behind the new season of @midnight and also to the people at CBS News.
James you and your show, the crosswalk musical, the carpool karaoke it all got everybody here including me through the covid pandemic and we cannot possibly thank you enough for everything you’ve done for us and I can tell you people will be watching you still in decades to come it was a pleasure knowing you and thank you for bringing joy to our homes x 🎉🎉🎉

8 years to late !! Get back to the UK and make more shows like Gavin and Stacy
I gonna miss it. Thank you for your work.
Thank you, James Corden! ❤️‍🔥
Thanks for making it possible, to watch it outside of USA...
James Corden and the team you guys always brought so much joy to us. Thank you so much for all the hard work. We will miss this show so much.
The tragedy is that Corden’s narcissism is not ironic.
17:52 girl same
🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹😭😭😭😭😭😭 Ohhhh James we will miss you thanks for your videos it’s so fun and loving
Life's not fair...everything has a begining and also...has an end 😢
What a song at the end!!!  ❤❤❤❤❤
Wow!!!!!! What a show.  And so honest and so human and so transparent but at the same time so profesional, funny and well written.   Congratulations on these eight years and to keep alive those incredible memories
Mercifully, he’s gone.
Did not enjoy his political so called humor.
Goodbye James! We'll always miss you :'(   Thank you so much for doing the Late Late Show and making us all smile for so many years!!
Huhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhu
We’ll miss you 😢 😢😢
So little content in USA shows lol. Good though
I loved your show so much, you will be missed. Thank You for all the laughter en brightness
Wait, I'm confused... is the whole show ending?
Who watches Tv at 12.30am?   The ratings were 1.4 million viewers..typically it’s under a million.  300 million people in the country…even 1% of that is 3 million.  So he drew 0.5% of the population.
Fav late show🥺!
Thank you james for being the most funniest person and bring laughter on everyones faces, you really are a Gift from God, God bless you Amen
Bye bye
🥺🥺
29:26 why does he have the desk back
I cannot watch this useless waist of space
❤
How can anyone enjoy this absolute shite?
Thanks James for these incredible moments. I followed you from France, on youtube regularly, and I will miss you a lot. You made me so laugh. Enjoy your new life.
😢wow!
sad , thank you james! <3
Thank you for your words James. It's been a couple tough years for everyone, and I'm really deeply thankful for all the comedians and late night hosts to deliver their wonderful work and service to our people and ease each other's pain and worries by covering us in an abundance of hilariousness, art and a bunch of good and bad jokes! So ty for that, TY 🙏💜🙏💜😻💖🙏
It's too bad I'm finding this show near it's ending it is so funny this guy is hilarious so said to see him go I wonder why he is leaving the show?
This show will always be in our hearts.... Love you James!!!<3
I will remember the show  Mainly carpool karaoke 😢❤
His next show should be The Early Early show! 😂😂😂
I am going to miss this show so much. It always Brightened my trip to and from work.
😂
Turned it off when he gushed over biden
Loved that they ended a great show with a beautiful song ❤  So many people has been a part of this show and I think they were in the audience. Very emotional watching ❤❤❤
Well done mate. Through my uni days I remember this show just popped up at the right time an I was always like; yes the late late show. Thanks James for bringing joy to the home and being the best late late show of the past decade. All the best for the future Sir. Congratulations again. Cheers...
Tu as parfaitement tenu ce rôle difficile d'être un animateur bienveillant, drôle et intelligent. Ce show est merveilleux. Il va me manquer, beaucoup. La créativité, la qualité du groupe.... Un énorme bravo et un gigantesque merci de la part d'un fan français !
Could james host a chat show in good old blighty?
I'm truly going to miss this incredibly warm, openhearted, funny, lovely, genuine British man.  I'm sad this is his final show, as the energy and his show family were amazing!  So happy 😊 he's going back home with his family and his new 💓 American baby girl . God's Speed
Omgosh it's way too funny at 330am on May Day  thank you  Dave Letterman,  Jimmy Kimmel,  Jimmy Fallon,  Stephen Colbert  way too much fun
The most emotional part for me was the insightful remarks James Corden shared on how the United States has changed in the 8 years of the show's running (here's the transcript from minute 32:50 https://youtu.be/AeEYQ62t8hA?t=1966  "I will be forever grateful for what they've done for me and my family. It's been life-changing, It really has because moving here to America eight years ago was a huge leap for me, my family. My son was three, our daughter was twelve weeks old and we now have another small person and she's American ... We started this show with Obama, then Trump, then a global pandemic 😷, and I've watched America changed a lot over these past few years. I've watched divisions grow and I've seen and I've felt a sense of negativity bubble and, it points boil over... and I guess all I want to say tonight is I implore you to remember what America signifies to the rest of the world 🗽. My entire life if it has always been a place of optimism and joy 🌟. And yes, it has flaws, so many, but show me a country that doesn't. Show me a person that doesn't. Me, you, all of us, we are all trying to figure this out. We are every single one of us a work in progress; and just because somebody disagrees with you, it doesn't make them bad or evil, we are all more of the same that we are different. And there are so many people who are trying to stoke those differences and we have to try as best we can to look for the light, to look for the joy because if you do, it's out there and that's all this show has ever been about. All we've ever wanted is just to be a little, a little bit of light and levity at the end of your day. Thank you for letting me do this, thank you for letting me in your home every night... I've never taken for granted what an absolute privilege this has been." 🌟🙏THANK YOU, JAMES🙏🌟
im going to miss James Corden, i found out about him when i was in 9th grade and i had some good memories here. maybe we can see him again soon! there's no need to feel bad about starting over ya know?
Stop. Everyone is allowed to have bad days and say $hit they regret. You don't know Corden personally so please, stfu haters.
Finally
Good riddance, James Corden is a terrible person and doesn't deserve to have his own show.
23:23 DIRECTIONERSSSSSSSSS😭❤❤❤🤞
Let's go Brandon
How fun is that 😂  ❤  I'm going to miss you James Cordon
It's called the *late late* show for a good reason 👍
I'm wondering why the show ended. It's actually a great great show. 😊
I am going to miss watching this show.  He is so genuine and talented. Can’t wait to see what he does next. Good luck to you Mr Corden. ❤
This show has made the best memories I could ever ask for, it always made me smile when I was at a low point, although you didn't get one direction back together, you're still my favorite host haha, we'll miss you james!!
Wills entrance would have been overly dramatic... Had I not seen every episode of the Eric Andre show
I DON'T WANT THIS TO BE OVER
Lot of watching this video...
ugh thank god finallyyyy
THE GIRL THAT FELL AFTER HARRY GIVING HER A FISTBUMP IS SO ME

25:27 harry smashing the table 25:35 gentling placing the hammer down
Wow…this is the most heartfelt thing I have seen on regular TV. I am blown away. Wow! James…thank for being absolutely real and open. Thank you for your grace to open up and share all of this.
Oh, I miss you, James, you are unique
I was introduced to james about 5 years ago about the same time when my parents got a divorce. Watching James carpool karaoke and crosswalk videos were such a big part of my childhood and I will never get bored of it. Thankyou James for cheering me up after hard days. You will always be my favourite talk show host :) goodluck!
Thank you for everything James your such a woderful,kind,funny person...
When will said that about England I bet Harry was saying in his head “treat people with kindness, treat people with kindness, treat people with kindness 😅“ then he snapped but  James was laughing his head off   Also your show James is so funny and just puts a smile on anyone’s face and just brings you joy when you watch and I’m glad that you are choosing your own path for your self and family, so I say good on ya James ❤
Thankyou so much, James 😭💖. This show mean so much for me. I love this show and you. Thanks for all of your effort, your time, your energy. ❣️❣️❣️ Love you.
its so sad
This is the first I heard of this show 🤷‍♂️ Lauren is involved 🤷‍♂️ peace to you , love your films 😊 imagine having the money to promote, stick something in someone's face, and not have to say , starve and say do you want fries with that 🤬
It was about time....
hype no more james
Thank you, James
James, thanks for the memories. 😭
Goodbye James Corden 😢❤❤🎉
Welcome home James ❤❤
I don't think I've cried this much since my mum's wedding 😢
Thank you for the laughs! ❤
No "Celebrity Noses"
did you ever do a show from the UK?  How about bring the crew over for a week :)
Thank you.  Have Ian show you Portland sometime!
Best late night show ever.   Bummed me out
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS BULL SHT 😡
James corden we love u so much
I’m so sad
хайир жамес
Joe biden ruined the show.
Thanks James🥹🫶
Can’t believe it’s over. Been watching this since in my first year of medschool, helped me through the darkest days, and ofcourse made me laugh and cried like no other. What a show. Can’t help but cryinggggg for 40 mins straight 😭😭😭😭
Out of all the late shows, this one has been the best. Thanks for everything James ❤
Good riddance.
Why he quit?
Oh thank Jesus Christ, the show is fun only f****** over. Finally he can go back to where he came from and let the britons make fun of him properly. What a waste of space he is
As much as I like James, Will is not my fav..
I will forever remember James and this show. It brought so much joy. So fun, so beautiful, and so much joy and all the emotions I could imagine I could have. Graritude to you and the team from far east Japan! We will miss you so much!!
Sorry for Will and his LA Kings losing :P
To funny with him and Trevor on the Masked Signer
Wow, this is the first time watching this show. We’re they all this good? James seemed like a really nice person.
😢😢😢
😂 25:23 28:10
This show took me through medical school and beyond
HURRAY !!!... He was a talentless hack with the appeal of a rotting banana. He didn't do so hot in Britain either.... I am so GLAD to see him go. Maybe he can reprise his role as that lame a** show cats.... Adios, James !!!👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Hologram of Joe Biden
I miss you so much James, the best of all times 🥹🥹🥹
Now it's bitter to accept that neither late late show neither one direction are coming back 😭😭😭😭😭
🙏🏼 You’ve had a hand and helped divide this country unfortunately sad but true… I hope you enjoy time with your family and best of luck in future endeavors. God Bless
Will u stil be doing the car karoke
Much love from Finland ❤
Terimakasih banyak. James is one of the most talented hosts. He is more like an artist. He is a full-packaged entertainer.
will miss james cordon. what a talent and class act.
Corden is talented but he is a douche bag human being
i know we’re being sentimental in the comments and ive loved this show forever but did anyone else see the girl fall @ 17:51 after fist bumping harry styles
I love you James!!!!😢❤
James Corden is a talented and creative performer. We've been fortunate to have him with us these last eight years! Many good wishes to his family and him. His values are in the right place to put his family first. May he also have many other career triumphs ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Thanks for making these fun shows JC and for entertaining the world!
... We started with Obama  Then Trump  Then a(nother) global pandemic ...
ᴮʸᵉ ᴶᵃᵐᵉˢ ʷᵉ ᵃʳᵉ ᵍᵒⁱⁿᵍ ᵗᵒ ᵐⁱˢˢ ᵗʰᵉ show
Gonna miss ya James you're the best😢🥺
While I respect his decision to leave entirely (get your real life man. It goes quick. And once it’s gone u are gonna miss it.) I’ve very much appreciated James Corden! Dude, you’ve enriched my life and I’m sure many many others! Thank you for being here when u were and you’re just so iconic that people will hold a place for u should u ever decide to return. If not, much love to you! I wish u the best in your life and I can’t wait to see the projects you work on from home. ❤ if u choose not to work on anything than I just wish u the best man. Much love and thank u for bringing people together. 💪💪✌️
I watch their YouTube videos every morning when I get ready for work 🥺 I’m going to miss this show.
Amazing ending to the show! 🎉
Harrys clothes 😂😂😂
At the beginning they were clapping because the show was ending, not for you...
😢
Fare thee well Late late show, may your futures be bright.  Safe trip home Corden family 🥰💙
Thank god it's over
Thank you James for the amazing show for 8 years 👏👏👏 you are such a great host❤️ May God Bless you on your next journey in life ❤
Like si nunca habias visto un show completo hasta ahora por que no vives en estados unidos.
What a dirty narcissistic turd. seeya
The fact they got Biden to do a camo nice 👍
I cried so much I can’t believe ima miss him so much…
It’s that for real ? Unsubscribe is coming 😅
Wow i remember how emotional i was when Dave Letterman had his last show. James did well liked his closing msg. Also all the late night guys. Amazing. Wait i think the all did this show one time.
Never watched one episode
From Saudi Arabia I’m really gonna miss this amazing show ,thank you all❤
Wish you much success, thanks for all the laughs and that little bit of light in our lives
You did good James, you came in and changed the late night game. We’ll see you’re influence for years to come. Thank you for everything you’ve done 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Well that was a tear jerker ❤ you will be missed! Enjoy your next chapter ❤
He will be missed…one of America’s best hosts of the 2000s, and he grasped all our hearts even more when everyone said Craig Ferguson couldn’t be replaced- thank you for everything James- you are an LA legend
What a ride it has been, thank you James for making us smile and laugh during times when no-one else could. It's been a pleasure, good night.
So sad.  I literally cried. 😢😢😢 Gonna miss you!!! Thank you James!!❤🎉❤🎉
Taking a shot for James rn
💔💔🥺🥺🥺
You all will be missed 🩵
I’m gonna miss this show
Will is an amazing actor. ❤
We are going miss you jame 😢
17:49 are you ok?
I love that he did a final bow. I was secretly hoping he'd do that as he walked to the curtain. Marvelous ending. Conan had to end his show twice lol but both times he was super sincere and made very moving speeches; the final time, Conan almost broke and had to turn his back to the camera after saying goodbye. But I think Corden did just as spectacular a job, more of a showmanship farewell. I'm new to Corden as of the pandemic, so I can't believe how it's only been 3 years... and I used to watch Craig Ferguson but never made the connection that this was the same show! Amazing how Corden made it his own. I wonder if as I'm writing this, Corden isn't on a plane to London already or when he's actually moving.
Why did it had to end it??
Why must all good things come to an end? 😢
Where have I been for the past 8 years??? Never knew James replaced David Letterman. Or am i wrong?? I'm a night owl but not really watch regular tv only Netflix n some other app shows. Darn I missed alot of this funny guy. I jus came upon this video.
Wish you the best James!
Nooo, not the Late Late Show. I love James Corden ❤
this is sad
I am such a fan but the Joe Biden part.. really… he is the worst president we have EVER had! He did not deserve any part in your amazing accomplishments! Anyways, you will be so missed!! Thanks for all the laughs over the years!
Farewell. You were all amazing!!🎉
I know this was a hard decision but so happy for him and know he’ll look back in this time with his son and family and know he made the right decision… eventually, he’ll be in another stage of life and could always return or do some specials…  best wishes always!!❤
Thank god its over
He quits does that mean everyone loses there jobs?
17:49 wait did she pass out lol
Thank you James
Where was Conan
I’ve laughed, I’ve cried, it is so hard to say goodbye. This show has done something special, and has brought joy and laughter to so many. Thank you so much for everything from the bottoms of my heart. Thank You James Corden.
It's been a wild journey. Sad to see The Late Late Show with James Corden come to an end, but life must go on.
17:46 Anyone else see the girl faint when Harry gave her a fist bump? Because same, girl. Same.
I’m totally not crying ❤❤❤
Everting ends and so does life. The mark we leave is all that is left. You leave a mark we will never forget.
Isn't Ellen still on?
Come on James. You are competing with sham wow and flex seal infomercials.the network is not keeping the late  late show.who even stayed up to watch the show? 😂😅say ello to the king ,queen and all the royals.well not all you have to say goodbye to the spare before you leave la la land .I think he and the family are staying at Steve Harvey 's.house.guess you have to take that tour bus to locate steve.cheerio ol chap

Show pony
Love from the UK! I watched it few hours ago and I’m so proud of you. Can’t believe you’re be heading back to the UK and your did us proud. Thank you James Corden.
BRILLANT US HERE IN ENGLAND ARE SO PROUD OF YOU X
Thank you Mr   James for making me laugh, going to miss the karaoke car, you have so many talents and are a very humble person, wish you and family the best, hope you continue doing other things, again thank you so much keep smiling and dancing 🌹🌹🥂😘
Always have loved James Cordon. Gavin and Stacy, Red Nose Day, Comic Relief and everything else.  Your parents and family have to so proud of you.
No more baby mochi and papa mochi😭 bye imma go cry now
ick
Glad this show was gone…
Awful show. I love how he took a sweet moment from his mom and shat on it. And having Biden on? Well that's the perfect way for one loser to send off another. Happy cancellation.
Wow! I cant believe its over. I've had another baby, switched jobs 4 times, and moved twice. Carpool karaoke has always been my "mom" time, so this was emotional for me. Thank you, James!
34:01 wow just an amazing words uttered by James and it relates to each and everyone one of us and it is so powerful 👏🏻 best wishes for your future endeavors 👏🏻 🙌🏻
Didnt watch much of it but I'm still crying (?)
I love your show it’s the best , loved everything you brought a new way to a late show you made me laugh and just being amassed a what you can do ( was there anything you couldn’t do lol ) love you so much and you will be missed. I wish you all the best and maybe in the future we might do something again and I will be watching.
Good Riddance
finally he's gone
This show started when I meet my Girlfriend eight years ago. Now she is my wife. Thank you James for bring great joy and happiness in our life. God bless you and your team.
Conan should have been there and jay leno
james its look so fun if i can be you. a man full of talent, have a great job and people love it so much and have so much friend who proud of u. damn what a wonderfull life
For gods sake stop screaming
James, congrats on your show. I've been a fan of Craig Ferguson and in the beginning I was comparing you but you've done your own thing and it was really good. Congrats and thank you.
That ending by Reggie is just icing on the cake. I wish they kept it going for just a few seconds longer. It's soooooo addictive! Can you imagine if that had been the ending of each episode for the show?
Sucks go back to uk you be missed I just wish I could meet you before you went back but god bless you safe travels
JAMES W HARRY MY FAV DUO FOREVER!!! 😭🤍
thank you for everything, james :( i’m going to miss it so much…
What a great ending to an incredible show. You made me laugh so many times over the years, even on the hard days. Your smile was always contagious. Thank you to the whole staff for an amazing 8 years. You will be incredibly missed.
Boy how I am gonna miss James so much, I have always dreamed of going to the studio, but I hope he enjoys the rest of his life with his loved ones.
I’M SOBBING JAMES
james e harry juntinhos eu amo tanto vcs, vou sentir tanta falta mds😭😭
why did the show end?? what was the reason?😭😭😭
First Ellen, now you. The end of an era
Harry style loss his style
James Corden is truly a class act. I knew it was going to be tough to watch his goodbye show because of how humble he is; I just didn't think I'd be sitting here blubbering like a baby, heh. The fact that he wrote a complete song is not only totally him, but an amazing way to pay tribute to the last eight years in a nutshell to everyone who made this era of the Late Late Show possible. Wishing you and your family all the very best, James.
I'm sad I was crying watching James Corden last show. I'm here in Australia but always .love to watch his show. 😢😢😢😢thanks for the great show you always put on James❤❤❤ ❤❤
He will be so missed, no Ellen and no James…… endings suck:(. But I say Kudos that he gets to leave and go home and not have to deal with the crap going on in this country. We’re losing a happiness here that you can’t replace. Good luck James!! Hope we see you again!
Thank you so much James Corden, you will be missed and perfect final episode and ending, sending you wishes in spending more time with your family in London, you made us laugh and you are very funny and talented, have lots of fun!
No , you see. James you still need to get 1D back together again.
I like your show because it is not as politically vocal as the others. And it focuses on entertainment. Makes me laugh, especially the crosswalks and Tom Cruise type clips. Really enjoyed it! Love from Singapore!
Thank you for the late late show! I am bawling heaps after watching this ❤ God bless you and your family. ❤
Thanks James!! It has been awesome!!
You had a great run sweet Jim.. You will be surely missed by your fans! Move forward with greatness because you sure have earned it 😊 Good night my friend 😘💕
Love from Australia James! You brought joy and laughter to our lounge rooms every night and got us all up singing and dancing. I'm so greatful for the space you gave us to be silly and happy and not take life so seriously. We are going to miss it. Good luck. You will do more great things just please never stop the dancing and the singing coz the world needs this piece of your unique light. 🌻
I started balling my eyes out during class when James said "it's time" at the end of the song omg :( We love you James and we will miss you!
This shit is corney and not funny wtf are people laughing at
Reggie Watts finally free
Great Show, I can not believe he is leaving.
This is one of the saddest moments in television history, but I understand that you wanna go home to London and that’s fine. I hope you have an amazing future and I wish you all the best of luck James❤
End of an era
Thanks to CBS to leaving it avaible to everyone to watch it here, its such a nice move 🤗💜😩
AHHHHH
James I miss you already❤ God bless in all you do in the future❤
'.. more things that we have in common, than in different'    💜
Loved you since the first time I saw you on TV. YOu are so refreshing, super talented, a great lover of music, song and lyrics and that genuine enthusiasm that one cannot recreate with the passion that you possess. I will miss you and Car Pool for sure.
Thank you James. Welcome back home.
☹️☹️☹️☹️☹️
This show leaves like a wafting fart that never ends. We get it, you don't have a show anymore. Waft.
Thank god thats over. Absolute  cringe. Craig ferguson must be turning in his late night grave.
There are no words to express the joy that this show has given me. Thank you for 8 years of laughter ❤
P.S....you got quite a Voice
Awesome exit. God Speed James.  Carpool Kareoke was always amazing also
FAREWELL JAMES. Although we are all saddened to see you leave and for the show to be over, we are all happy for you and your family! :)
I will miss watching new episodes. This show has brought me more laughs than most. Thanks James..best of luck to you and your family. Enjoy your time back at home in London. Can't wait to see what u do next. Don't ever stop being you and singing and making people laugh.❤
It will always hurt, love you James. Thank you for making my life better with every show. Love from Ecuador.
Thank you 🙏🏾
Go woke, go broke.  This shows a perfect example....
What great star to show. 😅 Thank You for amazing 8years James Corden. 🙏🏼☝🏽♥️
27:55  Harry was like oh hell naw😂😂😂
WE LOVE YOU JAMES AND TEAM, WE LOVE YOUUUUUU!!!!! THANK YOU!!!!!
James is the best!!!
Why is the last one episode?
Now if we can get those other four idiots shows cancelled, and get some hosts that aren’t left mouth pieces, we can get back to funny night time television.
Well, he is certainly going out on a high. Are those Louboutin on his feet?
what a speech, bro . I am in tears like a baby. God I gonna miss you too ;(
Good riddance
God bless you 💖
Many congratulations for a wonderful show, and best wishes for what lies ahead!♥
Absolutely beautiful!! Ty for being you James. May you and your family prosper in the rest of your days!!
love you harry i just wanna say that 🤍🤍
: )

Just me or did the girl Harry fistbumped when he came in faint??

Congrats to James and the team for those 1200 shows. We will miss you too!
What the hell is Harry wearing
We will miss you James.  Thank you for all you have giving us.  The best to you and your family.  xoxo🥲
I cried so much during the song, it was beautifully sung, and most importantly it was sung from the heart.  Thanks for being an amazing host and giving us your time to make us smile. We'll miss you, James Corden! 😭💜
First time I've ever choked up at the end of a late-night show. You will be missed.
they nicked the starts from chris evans tfi and later with jools holland
Absolutely no one with a brain of their own will miss this garbage show
I love you forever, Thank you for everything 💝😭.
The great thing is…. He’s retired with a load of unearned money. Mayybe he’ll eat his own gut next
It's really nice that your crew got to share in the moment at the end. It's always so hard when a show ends and you have to say good bye to your work family.
ITS FINALLY OVER!!! WE DONT HAVE TO SEE JAMES CORDON ANYMORE!!!!
will miss this show
Keep him over there please. Vile individual.
What a class act
hi
Thank god
If only you were American then you wouldn't come home.
I am so happy I can watch the full show online from Germany 😍😍 Thank you so much for this incredible show James ❤
Why is the show stopping?
We will miss you James thank you for all the amazing memories ❤❤❤❤❤
What are you doing next James? Where can we see you from here?
Thank  you  james  best  off  luck  on what's  next
Harry’s so funny his just trying to make it better❤
Where is Craig Ferguson? He was the absolute best. That’s a different network I guess.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ Thank you so much, James Corden for all the laughs... Please come back soon! Love yah!! Appreciate the band, the staff, and the crew of the show.
Well done everyone. Was a pleasure watching from New Zealand ✌💚 Best of luck back in the UK James and family x
Touching all the people that don’t want touched as he walks through. Lol
Rubbish
I will miss the band... and Ian the most... I wonder if I will see him ever again 😢
Somehow somewhere over the fatty rainbow 🌈 I thought u r my cubby huuubyy!!!!! However I’m the Irish ☘️ Maid!!!
Reggie taking off the sunglasses did me in (and I didn't even really watch the show so much)
Literally like watching david brent
I can’t believe that it is over no why and we all miss it all ready ❤😂🎉😢😮😅
You guys are so funny 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I really hope not a single video on this channel - or the channel itself - will ever be deleted. I want to come back in 10 years and watch James Corden wrestle with the Red Hot Chili Peppers in someones front yard, that is the dream.
Thank you to the whole crew. I will very much miss Carmel’s sense of humour.
Thanks god it's over
This show has been a blast to watch you are truly hilarious and much love from Colorado!!!! Big fan lol
Instant radiohead 😏
Man i can't believe its actually over, All the memories, all the Momments, Hopefully all will be Forgotten ✊.
❤
Thank you for the joy you brought to many homes. You have a family in the USA but your real family is calling your heart. Best always James ❤
I miss one one direction
First Conan and now James. If the Jimmy's say their good byes it will mark an end of an era
James. You did a magnificent job that made people around the world very happy. Wherever you go and do, we will follow you. God bless you James ❤️
He sucked every minute of every show.  Insufferable, talentless.  Imagine picking this Tool to replace Craig Ferguson.  Of course he goes out with a hacky skit.
I'm Brazilian and I'm holding my tears . this show has always been so funny, emotional and clever. I'll miss it so much 😢
One of the best late shows that I've watched!🙏 Thank you for all the laughs and good times!❤❤❤ God bless you all!
He so dramatic,  and trust me they wanted him off because how he acted in the restaurant situation,  goodbye James have fun not getting a paycheck 😂
He's always been hilarious huh.. omggg this is so cool when all the American hosts gathered at his house for his farewell last show.
Corden has been very clever. I think I’ve read somewhere that a lot of people in Hollywood can’t stand him and that he’s been very rude several times and he’s leaving before he gets cancelled (I hate cancel culture BTW).  So… clever move , Corden. Family time and then going back to theatre or films.
let's goooooooooooooo this shit is over
YOU CHOSE THE WRONG SIDE JAMES AND EVERYBODY IN HOLLYWOOD IS GONE
Thank you for publishing the FULL episode. It means the world to me. What a fantastic farewell; I hope you enjoy the next 6 summers with your family, James.
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 this is a tearful!!! This man is a beast! HE SINGS ALL THE SONGS IN CARPOOL! His accent😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩
Wowww. Such a touching last show. So much honesty, openness, and warmth. Thanks team for making this show memorable and great
ESTOY LLORANDO
I enjoyed this show from day one and the final was just as grand. I’m sure you have more laughs to share with the world so this is not good bye but see you around!!!❤❤❤❤❤
What happens to all these people once they stop filming? I mean the filming crew?
thanks for everything james. ❤
Luckily it's over James can stop the acting now
You and the show were the reason I became a one direction fan back in 2015 when I was 14. Now at 22 I don’t know where time has gone. It feels like yesterday and at the same time, it feels like you’ve always been there. Thanks for the laughs and heartfelt moments.
I’m so sad…that carpool karaoke was my favorite thing ever 🥺❤️ good luck James. We love you
Having watched just 2 mins of this ego driven nonsense, it's even his voice when the doors are locked! Just do the show and bow out gracefully and  stop with all this over self inflated rubbish. Craig Ferguson you are not, let's see what happens when you get back here and we don't see you for ages when you are spending time with your family. Oh look, another Gavin and Stacey special... Which they all will do for the cash.
was he supposed to be funny
Thank God this is over...
The only reason this upsets me is is because now there's a fear he'll be back on British and Irish TV 😭
Goodbye papa mochi.  Until we meet again
I've been waitng half of my life for this day finally we wont have to ee this damn dude as much anymore
I'm gonna miss watching you James 😢😢 I hope there are more show for where we can still watch you
Ey wait what why?
So sorry to see you go but we all have to do what's best for us!
The fact it’s been 2 days and has 3.5mil views
Why am I bawling?! 😭
You can see how much this show meant to James and how grateful he was for everyone that had worked with him during the 8 years he spent there. Trust James to make it this emotional “that’s our show” had me in tears 😅🙈
we’ll miss you so muchhhh
this was always my favourite show i cant believe its honestly over so many years have passed so quickly thank you for making us smile and laugh  good luck for the future!
Im gonna miss getting carpool karaokes...... :(
Seriously, Letterman?!  Excellent
It will be a sad one if Jimmy Fallon has to go. He{s the funniest!
I have never been the biggest fan of Corden, but I’ll miss seeing his videos
17:49 that is literally me dying when meet someone famous
James gonna miss you buddy you bring so much fun to us you made us laugh for years hope so we will see you with something new super soon
THANK GOD IT'S JOEVER
17:51 that could be me
🙄🙄🙄🤢🤮
Are will Ferrell and Ron Perlman  the same person all these years 🤯
When he mentioned CBS I thought Nick Bernstein would pop in with the message. Nice last show! ❤
I’m dreading watching the whole thing. 😭 James kept me in check all during lockdown. Carpool karaoke was my sanity. I couldn’t watch this live because it meant goodbye. 😭 Love this show!! Xoxoxo
wtf that girl lost conscious just by bro fisting harry wtf
One of the most multi talented people on the planet has just left the building on his own terms. Quite simply, Thank You.
Our household loved you! we will miss your late night show thank you for bringing laughter to us i will miss carpool karaoke 💕
See, they love you in America, James - please stay there!
Where’s Conan in that skit?❤
what?!?!?!?
I WISH YOU THE BEST ON YOUR NEXT JOURNEY .GOD BLESS
...and you have bull penis.....which I believe......is in season.😂
What America needs, class. James is a legend.
Ok , but what he will do next ??
So from Tom Snyder to James Corden; 28 years of _The Late Late Show_ GONE from CBS.
You had me until Bidens dumbass was on. Peace out.
A one direction reunion 😌
Aww  am so sad 😢 I love James his the only late night talk show I ever watched & stayed watching His the best super sweet giving funny & so real ❤
('-')ゞ
Best show ever! The only one, besides Fallon lol that I would stay up for!
I know I'm just a negligible person for that super star. Anyway I was so comforted by his acting, humor and shows. He is the best show host in my life.
Bring back Craig Ferguson.. and Geoff Peterson.. they were way better…
What a great run, I can't wait to see what all this talent does next.
Utter cringe
Why does Harry styles have a fake American accent
25:25 harry hitting the mug at first  try is actually really impressive
Why is this show coming to an end??
Luv it. Thanks for all the laughs throughout the years James :)
@20:50 When Harry Styles flipped off millions, and wasn’t censored! 😂
American dream this is the 💩
Thank you ❤
I got to be a part of the audience and it truly was so beautiful, fun, and yet heartbreaking I got to sit behind James’ parents and his mom was teary eyes for most of the show, we had to reshoot the piano ballad bc James was crying and Harry got to tell his truth about his grammy performance but it got cut from the show bc of the time )):
What is harry styles wearing
I wanna miss this so much
i’m crying watching this episode, thank you so much james😭🥹🫶🏻❤️
17:53 She really fell god damn 😂😂
Guy was not funny.  Get the rest of the late night talk show host to retire too.
Corden. Despised in the UK.
Thank You For The Carpool Karaoke, The Best At That+
To be that impactful in 8 years says a lot about his character.
Thank you!
James, you are funny and talented and also seem like a genuinely good person. Thank you for sharing yourself so generously with us all. Take care and best wishes for the future!
Happens often, they dream with a success career in LA and when they got it, they just got bored and sick of it missing home! Anyway, it’s a fact that he created his own space in US and that’s remarkable!! 👏
Thank you James! It was just incredible to have you as a host of this show! You are unbelievable person with the brightest and incredible ideas! It was a privilege and an honor to see you as a host in this Late Late Show! I will miss you as a host!
not the girl Harry fist bumped straight up falling afterwards 😂
ThankYou James for always bringing me into laugh👏 Such a well done journey👏
puts the team on his back, still (corden). it's not a given.
say what you want about James but he knows how to make a good speech
Why are you leaving..
James and harry duo is the best we could have to this last episode. Love you james u r the best and will miss this iconic show ❤️❤️❤️
No more carpool kareoke :(
Hi is a legend thank you James
What a remakebel man’ we will always MISS HI SHOW  love from DANMARK 🇩🇰🇩🇰🇩🇰🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️
heck yeah such fantastic news 🎉
i remember coming home from school to watch this show and it always made me feel at present and optimistic amidst everything. now after graduating college here i am but no more feeling at present bc this will now be a part of my past lol
What a journey 🌹❤❤❤
What a ride, we will miss you, James. Thanks, everyone for the past 8 years, you have left your mark on late-night television.
The woke lossers of the left Scotland says you and Biden find a hole to sniff each others hair Trump world's president goes pick
What the f is that guy wearing..
the end :') 💓
Welcome home james look at the positives though mate your be able to invite young Harry to west ham . The first thing to do is train him to sing the bubbles song
I grew up watching the late late show. I was 13 when it started and I’m now 21. It has had a huge impact on me and it’s inevitable to say that I burst into tears watching this very last episode. I’m forever grateful for every laughter because of this show. Thank you very much for everything, We will carry you in our hearts❤️
….aaaand I’m crying…again….
Damn this is sad
When it really gets sad 10:56
I am crying 💔
Thank you James and all who made it possible. ❤
And thank you for hosting the FRIENDS reunion..
Amazing show! I will miss it!
The people crying and hugging at the end... Please
Ouu James!! See you soon, Have a goodlife in everything, thanks for everything I enjoy with U
Well, I'm thinking locked in the hallway is where the network has put Jim.  Money is the game. and competition is high!
Thank you for your "service" and greetings from germany
we love you so much James thank you so much 💙💙💙
It’s a talk show people. He didn’t cure cancer.
You can tell it's going to be a fantastic fucking show if it starts off with the National Anthem by Radiohead.🖤🤘
It's sad to see what happens to a dude who goes out of his prime, loses the fame he used to had and is then desperate for attention and clout so he has to create controversy like wearing dresses and shit and acting like a toggaf. That thumbnail just portrays it perfectly. 🤢
The nature of time is a complex and elusive concept that emerges from the entanglement between physical systems and their evolution, rather than being an absolute and independent entity in itself.
We'll miss you man. Hopefully you pop back on our TVs soon enough
I was literally growing up with him and now he‘s gone
I wonder how long ago did he decide to end the show cuz they made the final Late Late so truly EPIC. Stuning performance James, I can notice how much you loved your job as a host and how deeply you´re gonna miss having new adventures, can´t wait to watch your next move. Absolutely wonderful everything you did so far.
Can't stand him. Not funny...not a nice person, arrogant and annoying.
I can't believe the show has ended😭 I'm not from the USA but I dreamed about moving there since childhood and still dream about it as a teenager, and this show was the one of my biggest motivations... I studied English with it, grew up with it, sang in the car with that carpool karaoke videos... When I was feeling sad you gave me a motivation to live, thank you❤ Also I dreamed a lot about visiting this show, maybe even becoming a guest if my acting career would be successful... Now I know that these dreams would never come true, but it is not the end of the world. The late late show with James Corden gave me the confidence and laugh, gave me Christmas and love and many more things... Thank you❤ Hope you will be happy with knowing that you changed someone's life❤ Good luck with everything you will ever start❤
Thank you James, thank you late late show. It was on my bucket list to attend the late late show and now it’s going to be on the list forever ❤
Good riddance SEE YOU LATER! Xoxoxo
Love you James forever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Made me cry. America will miss you.
17:51, did anyone else notice the girl fainting after getting a fist bump from Harry Styles
I want to see Bidens goodbye message to Tucker Carlson.
I feel sad for show n all for the stuff that this show ask our boys about reunion stuff continuosly n we get hopes every time n now it's gonna end we ain't getting clues anymore 😭❤️
😢 beautiful words near the end Mr.   Corden we do need to all remember what makes America great, and it's all of us in collaboration!
Not funny.😴
After seeing 1D reunion I can die peacefully
This is the greatest show so sad its the end😣😣😣
Thanks to James and the crew for making a wonderful 8 years of an amazing show for us. Can’t wait to see what you do in the future james. ❤️🥹
ok ..falla good bay and see you on next show ..hehehe
That girl that fainted at 17:50 🙈🙈🙈
Top man and well done everyone who make this happen, great fun, and thanks for 1200 smiles.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ Thank you for the joy!
Not one of the best modern day talk show hosts, is a decent enough way to put it
Loved watching your show from Japan. Fantastic send off. Arigato for million tears and laughters! 😂
missed  craig ;))
It’s over thank god
*I don't like the cheap, childish humour..  like in the minute **19:20** when he destroys the desk, and they all pretend like that wasn't rehearsed. Like, what's the point on pretend when we all know it was rehearsed? And they act like fake surprised it's so cringy and I don't get the humour of it it's very childish, like the type of jokes you make to an infant. This shows is good for kids but the thing is that it's supposed to be for adults mostly so that's why I find it weird... Anyway I still think they're hard working people and genuinely wish the best of luck to everyone involved in this show from now onwards!*
To James, Long live the King to entertainment and late night fun, comedy and escapism from our normal boring lives. 😢❤
Good Riddance
You're still an awful person 😊
So sad to see James go, I know his mother well, we grew up together in Tavistock, UK. We chat on Facebook most days now, such a wonderful mother to James.
Simply, thank you James.  It's been a pleasure.
Well , thankyou for everyone who helping this show going well , I really enjoyed this show ! Thankyou James ❤
Major vomit. 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮. Is this same James Corden who got slatted by a chef in America and got told. Then he gravelled to the chef. Pathetic. If I was him I wouldnt complain to any chef, you do not know what they do to your food before you receive it. 😂😂😂
🥂 to the best show ever!  This is not the end.
Awhhhh man. You suck James. Love you
Biden? What a wonderful president! Your a funny man james. I like you. Lets go brandon.
aw mannn
Please tell me you're not sending him back to us in Britain?
Still waiting for reunion of one direction 🥹🤌🏻❤️
Remember when he left England and he had his show and I was crying. Like now on his American. I watched many and I've watched every episode that I can. I know that I will be able to watch and still enjoy even the ones throughout and enjoy even though the lost carpool karaoke was absolutely amazing with my favourite London girl just like me Adele❤. The last late late show made me cry, very much!! Our James playing piano and singing❤ absolutely amazing to see what he  has managed to accomplish❤!!!
So many who came to the show are getting old but James is not 😂
Well done show. Lots of fun. James, God bless you! You will be Missed 🙏🏻❤️
I can't get enough from you in this team I wish this show last forever ❤
Why did he stop now? Something happened or he just wanted to end his show?
His show was Truly funny and original. When it first started,  I didn't really care for what seemed like a UK show.  I watched it again and grew to Love the show! James was not only funny, but a unexpected natural comedian and good human being.  His appreciation for his co-workers is what team work is all about.  His Love for his family, the US, and not forgetting where he came from is something everyone should strive for. Thank You! James  for spreading your light and making us smile for 8years on your show! ♥ ♥ 👏 👏 👏 🏆 🏆 🏆
James I hope you read this. You were the funniest show specially during the pandemic and with no audience around. I wish the best for you and your family. Thanks for the laughs.
Good luck James ❤
He should leave singing to others.
I wish you the best new beginning, Let's Go :)
Oh no :(
Going to miss uniqueness of Reggie, the band and Ian too...funny good people
First time I have ever watched this, I am so amazed I got through the first 5 minutes,
this the first episode I have ever watched and that was unbearably unfunny!
He was crying “like in a cool way”😂😂😂😂
All the best bro
the girl at 17:50
Congratulations to James and the whole team for giving us this beautiful show. ❤❤
Was that a fart,? Or James breath?
He nailed his speech completely
What james corden did alone with paul mccartney is just mind blowing.
Please invite BTS then The Hu boyband
Just how fast the night changes🥺💙😭
What a great last video wrap up of a great friendship between Tom Cruise and James Corden that will live on forever.
This show has always brightened my darkest nights, James' energy is always so positive and to see the final carpool and final show showing such a real vulnerable side to James, holy moly. As sad as it is, I wish all the best for James and everyone else in the Late Late Show production. I am so glad for this youtube channel, please never delete your content <3
Good riddance
whats he wearing?... again!!!!???? can the Brit celebs stop!!
Who's taking over?
This is hilarious 🤣 to his final show. Love you so much. You are going to be truly missed.. I wish you & your family the very best & sending many blessings on your future adventures whatever that is.. Thank you for being us so much joy in our lives. When life is not always rainbows 🌈 & Sunshine 🌞
My Favorite Late Late Host, good luck with everything!!!
So glad it's over  all these shows got to political
I'm so glad this garbage is over see you never again James Corden
It’d been inspiring for me to learn English because the show seem to be always funny and interesting so I work hard and enjoyed to study English very much since I watched this show. Now I’m still struggling with understanding with it little bit. But now I work as an English teacher in Japan. This show has changed my life thank you for amazing 8 years 🇯🇵
ouch.....I will miss
Im not crying its just allergies… i late for the late late show man…
Why can't this continue in England!?!?!?!?!?! 😭

Well i guess all good things has to come to an end. But why? I have loved this show from day one.😫😫😭
wow
Omg I miss the show already
He will be missed but I applaud his reason for ending. There is nothing more important then family.
Thank you James for the laughs and joy you brought us all over the globe.
The first scene when he greets the whole staff with a big smile on his face? Could it look faker than that?  Now where will he find another place he can force people to listen to him singing when people preferably prefer to listen to the guest who can really sing and the one every people were interest in? Good luck pal
todos a la calle por su decisión
Thank you for all of the laughs and good times ❤
Thank you, James!
was not expecting to see Will Ferrel with grey hair, 55 ain't even that old anymore
As a over 60 person, roaring that the bird is better at tech than mom or dad. So true. What an ending!  What an harmonious group of talent. How humble for James to have them embracing in the final moments of the show.
👏
Te amo James! Gracias por hacer un show espectacular siempre y por hacer un espacio seguro para nuestros artistas favoritos ❤
just wanted to say thank you for all these wonderful memories 💜
We gonna miss u buddy!🥹♥️
sad goodbye James❤  you will be missed.  wishing you the best & Hope to see you soon❤
James Corden thank you for the show you will be remembered big love from India 🇮🇳
PLEASE,PLEASE,PLEASE keep him,we cannot have two wankers on tv at the same time here in the UK,we have piers morgan already here,so unless there is a swap deal corden must stay.
He was rude to his people and now they're all celebrating that he's leaving...
I don't get the James Corden hate??
Craig Ferguson was better
Guys, you are the best !!! I love you!!!🤗🤗🤗 God bless America, the best place on the Earth!!!🙏🙏🙏🇺🇸
Love james
Best end of a show! So heartfelt! The song got me!😢
Is Harry a cross dresser or just visually impaired. Yeah Harry you look amazing... Yeah it's true..
obrigado... THE BEST
Take it off take it off, take him out take him out..
i’m really going to miss this show :( especially harry’s appearances <3
James that was an amazing Life speech you will be missed loved every part of the show.  Hope to see you on screen again,
Gonna miss you on late nights, James. All the best. Love from Manila 🌺
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤‍🩹
Why is the show ending?
What a prick, the amount of celbs that say he is the most aragant and prissy bloke ever is insane, at the start of his career I really liked corden but then he went into Hollywood corden, and Hollywood corden is a prat, but I wish him all the best in his future endeavors, James get outta Hollywood and get your soul back maybe you'll get a 19th chance.
I thought 1D will guesting 😭😭
That was Harry’s opportunity to ask why’s Niall his favourite 😂😂😂😂
YaY James Corden, brilliant Showman, excellent Comedian💙
Love this dude. Good Luck James
Thank you James for the fun and joy and laughter you have brought us all.  So much do I wish you had or will have an "Early Late" show for families.  If not every early evening, then at least once a week.  We ALL need that.  Will miss you wholeheartedly. Thanks Again.
NO the poor girl that fainted after fistbumping harry 💀
James Corden...please stay in the USA...don't come back to the UK.
Couldn’t stop crying. It’s like losing the late night friend. Btw thanks for the show❤ This’s really meaningful for me as well.
This is amazing.  This is really unfunny. Like- wow. I'm even wondering how this show even made it past the pikot it's so bad.
Sen kväll med Luuk var vassare ändå!!!!
When he sung the last few notes he could feel the end cominggg. I will miss the Carpool Karaoke. I will miss the light James brought so many of us
super fake. ARMY dont forget
The end of an era, thank you so much James. I had tears in my eyes
Thanks James❤
God bless you and your family ❤
😢😢😢
If it was that good it would still be on there air
So happy you started this show and it's been going for the last 8 years. Thank you James for everything, I will forever miss it.
It ended because everything that goes to woke goes to crap
Love you James. Thanks for the laughs and all the great memories. You made us all better.
James Corden does not deserve a platform anymore
Wait, people are actually sad that this shite show is finally ending?
why the show ends?
Sure are a lot of CBS bots on here, with all similar comments, all saying they are crying, what a crock.
He's so fake haha why are all these people in the comments thinking he's some messiah. He's an arrogant, rude bastard and no one liked working with him. Apparently when the cameras were off, he completely ignored the audience.
James gets way more hate than he deserves.
Cool. Now bring Ferguson back
you been through some parts of my journey James, hopefully to meet you one day anywhere in this world. Wishing you nothing but the very best into what's next for you and thank you for all the crew and the teams that made us laugh and have such a great time and happy memories behind the screen. Loving you guys a lot
One of my favorite tv shows ever, started watching it when I was 17, now I’m almost 24, thank u James!! 🥹💕
best day ever
Love James Corden, love his ingenuity n witty personality!! wishing him the best to his future adventure ♥️♥️
❤❤❤
Balling my eyes out at the end, James you killed that song! You will be missed 🥹💔
I'm so saaaaaddddd!!!
😪😪😪
I cried.A lot.
I'm going to miss your talent and wit. I wish you the best, although I truly wish you weren't leaving.
❤
good luck james.
本当に終わってしまうのですか?こんなに楽しませてくれるトークショーは、あなただけです。とてもさみしく思います😢
Goodluck from the Netherlands and thans YouTube!!❤
Thank you for the memories, James! I'm happy for you that you will have more time with your family. Goodluck on your next journey!!
THANK YOU JAMES!!!!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉😢😢❤❤❤❤❤ MUCH MUCH LOVE From Canada 🇨🇦
Should of left Biden out of it.  Really made a downer at the beginning.  Surprised he could read his lines right.
"We're more similar than different" so true and a very important message today. Unfortunately, Biden (or any president except maybe for Obama) is not the best person to represent it. Great speech. Amazing job. In the future be less political and you can make the world a better place, not just more fun.
10:29 this is going to be so ironic if he wins the election lmao 😂
Damn that Harry styles outfit is so embarassing...day fuq 🤔🤔🤔
I’m gonna miss watching him sm😭
❤love you man
"I'm selfishly excited you're coming home" Harry Styles. Loved that😁
to soon
I remember the day James appeared on Craig Ferguson's show, the week prior to him taking over the Late Late Show!  Great Job James!  Thanks for making us laugh!  🤟🤟
I will miss him. I remember his very first show. Reggie and him going door to door looking for a place to do his show. James will be missed!!!
thank you James for the laughs and the fun times you will be missed here  in America  I wish you the best  thank you and goodbye.   late late show (2015-2023) 🥺🥺😊
Thankyou James and Everyone involved in The Show Thank Goodness for YouTube so I can revisit The Late Late Show for all my Favourite bit's especially Carpool Karaoke and Crosswalk The Musical Loved Your Song James at the end so Beautiful Many Tear's Chookers with Everything baci x
Great episode James you did a great job
Ah man!! I thought they'd take him out the back and shoot him...
James, thank you❤
Lots of love  ❤  keep charming
Good riddance 😮‍💨

Sad times

17:47 not the woman having a black out 😂😂
started crying at 32:00 also... wow, so moving, such a beautiful family..
18:59 I felt awkward too bro 😂
Although I dont like his personality off stage, feels weird that the show with him is now over. Probably for the best though.
Thank you James, I'll miss the the show!!
😢😢😢😢😢😢❤❤❤❤❤❤
Poor soul you’ll be missed and all the best

Just wondering, would the employees really loose their jobs? I feel so sorry for them.🥺
Where are all this employees going to go? 😅
OK.  My standards aren't that high.
It's hard to say goodbye James,i wish you every good thing this life has to offer,and for Harry thanks for keeping our hope alive, fingers across, waiting for the union 🤞
I sooo hoped conan would also be in that epic bit
Didn't know what to make of James Corden in the beginning, but over 8 years time, he grew on me and mine. Hilarious talent we didn't know we needed. Gonna miss this guy.
You will be missed James.   Good Luck!
So all the staff would lose their jobs.😢
One of the GOATs for fucken sure congrats 🎉
So long, James.  America loves ya.
I had so much fun with this show over the years, thank you so much to everyone who was involved in making it!
I understand why he's moving back. Families age and don't live forever. Thanks for everything and best wishes for you!!💓
I was watching this show last 6 years, it was incredibly fun, very enjoyable and wonderful. Goodluck James, you are one of the best comedians in our world..
Thank freaking god.
Good riddance. Awful human being.
Starting out with Radiohead was nice
I only watched carpool karaoke. This wasn't really my show but I think it takes skills and discipline to pull this off every night and I wish good things to Corden.
1d reunion 🎉🎉🎉wohoo...Manifesting
Thank you James.... You made my day. Will miss you in the other show
Woah Radiohead in the into.
Great job James and Team, proud of you all.
Adieu James. Lots of love from India

the ending was so hard to watch was cringing so bad
When Will started singing “as it was” I cried laughing 😂
One down and many others to go. Hopefully Jimmy Kimmel and the rest of these Late Night dumb shows go away.

Bye. Can’t wait for you to bark at the next employee at a restaurant
23:24
Loved the band everytime, each segment was only funny once, though. Over time, it has become too over the top and predictable. I loved every second of Craig Ferguson‘s tenure, but have been over James long ago. Not saying he‘s bad because he’s not to my taste, wish him well.
I'm srsly sobbing, we all love you so much James and are so proud of you, we will miss this show so much.
O James Corden no inicio cumprimentando pela primeira vez os funcionários que trabalharam com ele durante anos.
You are so great James Corden! Thank you and the late show team for some great work! Going to miss seeing your comedy sketches, hosting, carpool karaoke and musicals! All the best to you James Corden! ❤🎉🤗
This show with those writers and staffs with a better host will be unstoppable...
can anyone hear what did the person say around 27:20 that harry reacted to?
will always appreciate how you treated 1D members and specially harry. And all the things you've done and all the accomplishments of this shows will stay in my heart and thanks for making us laught for all those years. goodbye and stay humble,never change please😫
°•♡•°
Fantastic final show James.Thank you and good luck.
Had to have scumbag Biden on
I heard he was a c**t
Beautiful
As a Uk citizen i am glad to see the back of this fake and false man who has conformed just to make his millions in the US...he is not liked by many here in the UK as he is seen as a Simon Cowell type....i wont watch the video but i'm glad we dont have to put up with him anymore
I enjoy so much your show. I want to tell you Thanks so much for give us a great show. I hope everything you will do good luck and sucess!! THANKS for everything. God Bless you!
❤❤❤❤
It's probably so exhausting working for the male Ellen. Annoying a$$ dude
Thank you for everything, James. Can't help but cry watching this.
This is how to end a fantastic show. There couldn't have been a better ending.
I’m I just crying with you James🥲 it’s been a beautiful journey. Thank you for everything, I’ll be missing you ❤
😢❤ epic Thank you! There will never be a show like this one. 🫶
33:58 - literally every other country. No other country has illegally meddled in other countries' elections like the US which did it over 90 times. And don't get me started on guns and the masses of illegal coups that have been initiated and led by the USA. What about ingredients in food? The US doesn't require companies to write them on the package.    The US represents a double face in the worst manner: Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde like.
He’s the best comedy guy. From carpool, to crosswalk, to spill your guts, to all the funny skits I will miss it so much
Good riddance
America please claim this man he's an absolute moron and is rude and agressive
This will always be my favourite. I'm proud of James
I've always loved talkshows and literally grew up watching this show!! Thank you all for spreading a so much joy ❤❤
good bay james
James flew the flag for the Brits abroad and did it really well. I was only disappointed once with that restaurant outburst story but one incident out of 8 years is nothing really. Come home James. Travel safe and I hope your star will rise again.
Will miss you James!
Thanks James and team, it has been fun for me
Thank you James :') You will always be our favorite host <3
David wasn’t with them together
Good riddance!
💗!!!
wait why is the last ep ? wym final ? 🥺
I absolutely love and respect how he gave credit to his team and had the last camera shots of them. That is great :)
Am going to miss my fav showww 😢
I hope Limmy sees the ending part (the fake crying part) of this and then combusts
harry 😍
I have always wanted to see this show live 😢but maybe in another life I would ❤
This is cool and all until you realise why he's leaving...
just dang it!!! so sad but happy for him!!
Why does the show end? Whats the reason?
We'll miss you Papa mochi....
On the one hand I feel great because this is the last of this unfunny, embarrassing show but on the other hand he is apparently coming back to the UK… please don’t
You’re one of the ones that stoked it, janes. Don’t try to walk it back now bc you’re considering your legacy all the sudden.
Thanks so much for disabling the geo-blocker and allowing viewers like me in New Zealand to view the full-length episode. James was definitely one-of-a-kind and CBS will be hard-pressed to replace him. Thanks again and all the best 🙏
I'm not crying you are
Wow! 👏👏👏 What an emotional ride! Thank you ! Good luck to you all! From Portugal with Love!
Can anyone tell me why the show is done plz?
THANK GOD. THE NIGHTMARE IS OVER. LET NATURE HEAL!!!
Thank you so much for years of joy and laugh. Your show was a light in dark moments. No matter the mood, it was always a good time to watch your crazy videos on youtube. I will miss you ! A french fan of The Late Late Show ❤ Good luck on the next chapter of your life 🫶🏻
Bravo, James and Team!  🎉🎉🎉 It’s been a great run! Got us through the COVID era of our lives!
First time seeing an episode only for it to be the last. 😅
At 17:50 when harry fistbumps the woman did she faint and her friend was so ready to catch her
So proud of what you have done, James. Coming from being Smithy in Gavin and Stacey, going all the way to America and succeeding in becoming one of the most popular talk show hosts there. You did it, you cracked America and I bet they are going to miss you 👏 ❤️
God bless you! 😢I'm so sorry you and your babies had to go thru that..... 😢
😂Good riddance to this woke show😂
It's sad to know that this is the last show. I'm going to miss James Corden 😢❤
Who saw the girl fainting when Harry fist bumped her 😅😂
all good things come to an end ❤
You did it! You finally got rid of that piece of shit!
Thank you, enjoyed much. The final song is too good. Best wishes for the team.
Wow, fantastic beginning with the other late night hosts and the ending... well, excuse me while I go blow my nose!
Painfully unfunny. I bet the crew were fucking delighted when they heard he was leaving.
Why ?! Someone explain me why the show is cancelled? Please ??
Thank you for all this years of joy, James Corden&crew. Big hugs from Spain. Thank you!
Will miss the comrauderie of the band and staff, Jame's adventures with Carpool Karoke and crosswalk musicals, Nick(!), and Steve playing before, The News. I so enjoyed and so appreciated all you brought us during early covid years and needed you during the trauma of Trump years. Thank you for everything, best wishes everyone, and hope we see you ALL doing good things in the future.♡
😒uh, more Americans losing their jobs. Biden congratulations on that was cringey.
Corden's show is like a terribel omelette.
Youre going to be very missed.  One of the funniest hosts ive ever watched.  You brought a lot of joy to a lot of peoples lives.
Genuinely going to miss James & all the Late Late Show crew 😭😭
Really disappointed of the last show. Expected more fun and emotions. Farrell is cool but the one direction guy was definitively misplaced as last guest. He said it’s team outcome the show but we didn’t see the team the people behind the camera. His best moments he had was with the staff. I was expecting more like baking challenge with James Gordon. Good think show run out since he had his peak already 2 years ago and should focus on his family now. Damn so disappointed.
James you are such a class act ,hope you enjoy the next chapter of  your life, thank you for putting a smile on my face over the last 8 years.
Seeing Harry, James singing, spill your guts was the best thing that ever happened on a show•⁠)⁠♡
Thank you  James for incrediple 8 years of entertaiment, and funny moments with you and the Best Carpool karaoke Moments in this Time.
There is a GOD!!! Thank Goodness this heavy potato bag is OFF OUR SCREENS AS A HOST. - HOPE HE CLEANS THE STREETS TO LOSE WEIGHT
😭
SOBS IM GONNA MISS THIS SM AND IM SO FKN HAPPY THE LAST ONE WAS WITH HARRY
Omg I cried literally the entire show. I actually didn't expect to be this emotional about this! Wow. Good luck in whatever comes your way in the future!!
I'm sad. This show was my daily source of Reggie.
28:08 BROOOOO😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
For sure i will miss this show! I really love James😍
I like how Conan and Leno weren’t a part of the late show hosts sketch. 😂
congrats man you went to LA made your dream come true and now you get to go back home to london
I’m actually crying watching this, I’m going to miss the show so so much thank you James for the best years of my life watching this show <3
I’m sooo going to miss you!
10:56 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
james you got me crying stoppp but I'm so proud of u
I’m wondering if there’s possibly anyone in the world to hate James?! I wish it has more seasons, but for every start.. there’s an end.
We will miss you ❤❤❤
Thank you James for bringing us so much joy, great guests, amazing musical performances, endless funny situations and sketches and for doing it all with love and humility. I hope you will be happy in England and fulfill all the other dreams you surely have. I look forward to it! Love you!!!!❤❤❤ This was my favorite show ever!!!❤❤❤
Damn !! That’s alot if unemployed people
The Last show was crap
To the Crew! and James Corden! Thank you.
JAMES CORDEN said this week: “I’m coming home to magnificent, beautiful Britain.” Yes, having been away for eight years in the States, Chubs has made so much money he’ll never need to work again and is coming back to what he, I imagine, believes is an adoring Blighty.  I'm not so sure about that. And do we actually want him back? We’ve all read the stories about his high and mighty behaviour Stateside, how he barely interacts with fans until the cameras are rolling, how he doesn’t know or bother to learn the names of the people who work on his shows, how he’s rude to restaurant staff and gets in a tizz - over an egg white omelette.   Brits don’t like people who think they’re bigshots throwing their weight around and Corden’s got a lot to throw. He needs to practise “humble” before he comes back, although I fear that ship’s long since sailed
Thank god he is gone, I have heard nothing but bad news about the way he treats his staff! Got to big didn’t you James!
So many emotions but damn that 1D question caught me !! Broke me!! I’m destroyed now and I hope it happens❤
❤❤❤❤❤ I'll surely miss this show
Sad the show ended now i have nothing to watch when it comes to talkshows :(
Thank god it ended
Спасибо, Джеймс и вся его команда, за непревзойденную атмосферу беззаботности и доброго юмора. Буду рада наблюдать за вашим творчеством в будущем. Оставайся таким же настоящим.   Thank you, James and all your team, for an good atmosphere of carelessness and humor. I look forward to seeing your work in the future. Stay the same unartificial.  From Russia with love❤
Thank you for all the good moments, this show should be forever. Please come back soon and good luck❤
Crying
One Last Time 😭😭
17:52 not the fan fainting😭😭
Thanks for everything James,  what you did was extraordinary, all the best ✨✨
Yay , Finally you are Gone 😂😂
I really enjoyed the wild late night escape with James. His pizzazz dazzled and his heart was worn on his sleeve. He touched deep chords of humanity with his humor and dramatic flair. I'll miss you, James Corden!
I'm so pissed I missed it live!!My power went out that night and my tablet  is WiFi so,no power,no WiFi! I just finally brought myself to finally watch it. James killed my eyes with the song. Thank you James for 8 years of all the fun,as well as when things got serious. You will be missed!! Maybe you could reappear on Doctor Who!! Much love from Seattle!!!
17:52 did anyway else see the girl pass out after harry fist bumped her 😭😭 me fr
You and your show will be missed. I will miss all of the gang. Too bad you never got to take the show on a cruise.
More blessings and more life to you James, enjoy your life✊🏽
What a great time . . With take break , carpool karaoke , who could have a better host. You will be missed😢 all great things must come to an end
the question asked harry about the one direction reunion made me scream too much. i really hope there is because they are so special❤❤❤❤❤
Шикарно. Странам бывшего СНГ далеко далеко.
I love james corden. I have watched his show. I will miss him. 😢❤
Bring back CRAIG FERGUSON!!!!!!!!
Im a fan of this show. Karaoke  carpool. Maaan!! All the way from Manila Philippines. 🇵🇭🤟🏻😇
I really enjoyed the rap battles and still watch them on YouTube. Well done James and the team
how could they not have conan in it too ?
Miss one direction. atleast Harry came though
All the best to All of You! I love you guys. Thank you for all the amazing years! ❤
the staircase is funny cause it happen to me at work few times doors opened from only one side hahha
James Corden and Graham Norton are best and their shows are better))
I thought this was a really elegant and heartfelt end. Well done to the whole team and best of luck to the whole crew in the future.
I started crying when 1d doing the no control dance
Fantastic news, hope james corden never gets another stint on the telly. Awful guy
Stupid, silly and cringey as fuck. Hope he stays in the US!
Let’s be honest, Jimmy Fallon should’ve came out of the fake laugh closet not Stephen
this is heartbreaking and emotional episode!!! can't believe Haryy is in the last episode!!!
Another hope for the directioners
i can't stop thinking that this is the end... thanks for bringing Harry !
thank you james
We missed you as we were watching the show! Loved your ending song.  Too bad someone had to try and be funny by ruining your desk! That desk was special to you. Get an actor who's only big hit is "Elf," now we know why! Best wishes James and family!!!
Reason for ending show?
Reading some of the comments here should make James feel quite proud of himself! 🥰 And I am so happy to see you all had a good time while watching the videos! As I had! 🥰🙏❤️❤️
Dear America,  You wanted him, you must keep him.  You made the decision to adopt him after the British people decided they didn't want him on our screens anymore.    Much love,   The UK.
I actually i am not a great fan of this show but as a BTS army i really loved how james made them feel so comfortable now i am really sad this man isn't gonna be with my boys in 2025 😢😢
❤
creepy guy. hope that's the last we see of him...though I doubt it.
I'm sadden to see that this will be the last show James.  What an epic final, to have Harry Styles and Will Ferrell be part of it.  All the best in future aspirations James!!   Thank you for a fun and fabulous 8 years. 🥰😍
Thank You Jeezzus ... The toad has left the building.
I'm going to miss this show but on the bright side, I get to see what James does next.  And to all of James haters, you can move on with your sad lonely lives. Now you have the opportunity to redirect your rage and vitriol at your own reflection in the mirror.
Really gonna miss him  So emotional😢
Thank you for these 8 years! ❤
Aww ❤
sleepy Joe!!!  huh
Remember that game on the show where he was asked the names of the crew around him and he couldn’t name one but he’s walking out shaking hands like they are besties 😂
I will miss this show and James
Seems like only yesterday. . .
You will be missed!🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻the best most talented late night show host! Have a great life, James!
have some dust in my eyes ... Great finale.
Thank you, James, for everything all these years!
39:39 They already miss him... "Don’t Cry Because It’s Over, Smile Because It Happened"
Thank you for posting it here for us outside the US . Give him a shoe in UK, he is great at this🤩
It wasn’t the segments, guests, or performances that made this show. It was the general vibe of the whole gang, from the band to the producers to the camera crew and back fo James.  That’s what I’ll remember about this show, just how much fun they seemed to have making it. Other shows have pieces of that; but this was the first to really bring an organic flow to it. Well done.
where is Lior suchard?
I literally YouTube every show.  What am I going to do now?!  It’s literally my favorite thing to look forward to.  Thank you for bringing happiness in so many of our lives!
Going back to England to give his kids a chance to have extended family is amazing. Jon Stewart left at his height to enjoy his family while his kids were still young enough to want their dad around. They can afford it!
I’ll miss this
Thank you for an amazing show 🎉🎉. I really can't believe you're leaving 😢
OKAY BUT WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THE ONE DIRECTION REUNION OH MY GOD !!!
This is like white people olympics
I’m British & I was saddened that a well known great National treasure was moving to LA but it all turned out great.  Good luck to you James & plz enjoy the time that u now have with your British family, you have done them, and is proud   😭. Yes British people do cry & don’t have so much of that “stiff upper lip” that we are famous for…… well done mucka & welcome back to England. Maybe u can do more Gavin & Stacy now 😅
Facilmente o melhor apresentador dessa área de shows da América do Norte, nenhum consegue ter o carisma leve que James tem! Fará MUITA falta um apresentador que consegue trazer o melhor dos convidados com sua simplicidade e alegria!
One of the best shows that ever existed!! ❤️
And thats why dude only lasted 8 seasons. Have fun across the pond
But if you all really knew he is an ashole!!!! Diva tendencies and is so mean in real life.
Harry Styles really is a weird little man
This was perfect to end the late late show I’m going to miss you so much. having Harry and Will as your last guests was amazayn. Good bye late late show.
14:48 it just kept getting better
Never forget the stories of this guy being an asshole to waiters at restaurants
yours is a tough act to follow james. well done and we wish you all the best. and so very true this show is just pure joy. grin till my cheeks hurt 😂
Where is the other guy late night host?
This is not dc universe
I am so emotional and the fact that he brought Harry as his last guest is sooo sweet cuz they do have an amazing friendship. Him leaving is the same as when 1D went on hiatus
tiktok got my hopes up for a one direction reunion in this episode now I'm sad
End of an era. I remember watching the show for the skits and especially the Carpool Karaokes.  Then the pandemic hits, no audience. Then James starts bantering with the band, Ian, camera guys and soon enough everyone else in the crew joining...even Nick! THAT's when the show truly became golden and became a must-see for me.  Thanks for all the memories. All the best for James and the whole crew. On camera you guys seems to had fun. Hope off camera you had fun as well and get a good gig going forward. Who knows that you can have reunion show from time to time and get the band back together again.
😢 this was very emotional.. love you James and all the amazing team who worked in the Late Late show. ❤️ ❤❤ thank you for made me laugh so much!
good riddance
James, you had an impact on so many of us who tuned in to get some joy and laughter when it was a rare commodity. Words cannot adequately express how grateful I am to you and your entire team for coming into my home and leaving it a little lighter every night. I wish you nothing but happiness and warmth in your future endeavors whatever it may be. Thank you!
AND GREG GUTFELD IS  THE NEW KING OF LATE NIGHT. Corden is dead. Long live The Gutfeld.
Finally, this day couldn't have come any sooner.
What would’ve been better patrick Stewart
even though james was not very liked by people but u cant deny his show was amazing i wish you all the happiness in life James
I am so sad
Man this made me cry more then it should
We are going to miss ur crazy British arse, James! The show was amazing,but those Carpool Karaoke's were EVERYTHING!🎵🎶🎙 I absolutely get u wanting to be close to ur folks,since they are getting older. And u and ur wife wanting ur kids to grow up,with their loved ones... If I could leave here,I would too! TRUST ME! Enjoy it! I know that we will see u again,in some form or fashion.... For now....Be well....Do u..We will be waiting 🫂💜
Haven't been a fan of the show or Corden a whole lot, but this was a good ending. Kudos to everyone who put in hardwork for it!
Im going to miss this show so much not waiting late at night past my bedtime to watch it won't be the same thanks James for always making me laugh for the last 8 years and i'm sad this is the final show but i'm happy you get to spend time with your friends and family❤❤❤
Piss off lol 😮
haha
Thank you James🫡
Thank the Lord Corden is out
LOVE YOU JAMES!!!!!❤️🥰🌹
I've never been so emotional and cried watching any late night show😭
The laughs, the love, the genuinely amazing times: James Corden, on behalf of Youtube, I thank you. You've been an absolute gem to the world, as a whole: I know it hasn't been easy. I know there have been ups and down. The only thing I can say is: there are so many women who dream to be with you and so many men who dream to be you. You are a GOD DAMN HERO.
Thank you James for this last 8 years, you´ve been great... we´ll miss you...
first of all, he was asked to respectfully resign after all the crazy, disrespectful things that he did. They are making it look like it was his decision when it was actually the network that started seeing his popularity fall. He also tried to make it sound like he just wants to move back to the UK but he knows that he wont get this level of opportunity in the US again for a long time and he is running away from all the negative feedback for his behavior. He belittled hotel staff, he was rude to his wife on the airplane on a commercial flight. I am so glad that this man is leaving. He also is too touchy with his guests that makes me so uncomfortable, maybe that is just a british thing but still odd in the US.  His position was terminatated on such short notice that they had no time to find a replacement so CBS brought back an old show to fill that time slot. Anywayyyyy he never answers the questions and just eats the gross food but it's not impressive because he had that same bull penis a million times o its not even that gross to him anymore so his reaction to it is not genuine. Leave buddy, nobody cares.
Harry - “Terrible timing with this door thing huh, cause it’s your last show. I mean what are the chances you know?  Absolute disaster…cause it’s your last show”  😄
Heard Cordon is a jerk.
We are gonna miss youuuuu cordann❤❤
Good riddance!!! Now his ego can sit back down
And of course Reggie's last notes are just gorgeous.
Why is he leaving again
WOW! We'll miss the entire team and especially the host. Thanks for 8 wonderful years...
Thanks for the hahas. 😂😂Anyone see how many views your show had... 🥳
Thankrguy. Enjoyed the humour when life is a bore
i remember harry saying hes never playing fill your guts again and he kinda did
Thanks you James and team ,your lovely family for everything!!! Kind of devastated about the show ending ! Anyway,it was awesome!!!
Thank you James Corden for a Beautiful ride 1200 episodes your amazing and a sweetheart we love you and we’ll miss you Hugs & Kisses ❤
Good Riddance
i'm going to miss you forever james, thank you for all you've done. 💓
I really gonna miss this show and especially James. Hell of a job for the laughs. Amazing job.
Will miss the english humour
Thanks James Corden for your 8-year sincere service to world class entertainment!
the best talk show for me  no matter what they say about you james you will always be the best host in tv history  what you have been able to achieve in such short period the other talk show hosts can't achieve in a lifetime  muuuuch respect to you james and to every single person behind the scenes❤❤❤❤
I agree,usa changed so divisive,
Why mess with radiohead?
Biden is so dumb bring back trump
I remembered meeting a girl and got instantly connected just because we watched the Late Late Show. We shared how funny and entertaining James was, the games, and how the carpool karaoke became the ones we were waiting for... Thanks Guys, Thank You James...
Thank you for the great, fun, creative, inspired shows you and the crews had been giving us! This final show really made me cry 😢 You will definitely be missed ❤️ Good luck for your new journey!
Se ve que son de calidad NEFASTA!!! PARA QUE PROMOCIÓNAS ESTO!!!!

27:10 when you have friends like that, it’s a great thing. We don’t come across people like that often.
Why has this show ended😢???
THANK YOU, JAMES.  YOU WILL ALWAYS BE MY FAVORITE LATE SHOW HOST.  I AM GOING TO MISS YOU SO MUCH.  THANK YOU FOR KEEPING US AMERICANS LAUGHING THROUGH HARD TIMES, ESPECIALLY DURING THE TRUMP ERA.  I WISH YOU GREAT SUCCESS IN LONDON.  CORDEN,  PEACE OUT. ✌️🇺🇸✈️🇬🇧❤️🥂🎼🎵🎶🎤🎬📽🎞🎥
Didn’t expect for me to cry this hard but here I am sobbing while watching the late late show one last time thank you James for always putting a smile on my face I will miss you. ❤

I'll miss this show man. Thankyou James and team for all the memories
RIP JAMES CORDEN
Good Riddance!!

I have to say I didn't know who Harry Styles was/is... had to google it. Corden is funny though.

Last show had my whole house hold crying. My kids 10 years old on up. You are their late late show host, to of course my wife and I.   James, you’ll be missed watching your work reguarly. But I have a feeling we will still see appearances. We hope. ❤ 😢 best wishes to yours and your family’s future. Thanks for the laughs when I needed them the most.
Such an emotional and incredible farewell for him. Rly appreciated for the Late Late Show and James, it’s been a big part of my English learning journey. I did enjoy watching it and it started to be one of my best teachers ever. Thank and bye James. TT🤟
I really really expected that when One Direction came back they will anuncies in the late late show… I don’t know if I laught or cry or maybe both options
I just hope he takes on his own advice about being a kind person.
IM REALLY GOING TO MISS YOU JAMES! YOU WERE THE BEST!!
I kept help but tear up 😢 I’ve been here since the beginning and 8 years flew by way too quickly. @jamescorden you will truly be missed, come back whenever you can!!! ❤❤❤
we would always miss you JAMES AND ALL THE MEMBERS , LOVE FROM INDIA 😭😭❤❤
Radiohead’s National Anthem at the beginning of this episode was perfection! Thank you James and good luck
I can't believe it's over. I've graduated from college, switched 2 jobs so far, gotten through 2 tough  breakups, and now getting ready for master's. Crazy how this show has been a small but significant part of that journey. Really enjoyed the carpool, spill or fill your guts, emoji news. Each bit was awesome. Brought a smile to my face. Loved the musical guest performances too. I'm going to miss James' show. Hope to see more of him in any other form though the host role was perfect for him.
I was not ready to cry!! What a great ending. Thank you James and Late Late Night show team ❤
17:50 Did the girl fall or do a Beatles-esque faint?
So there isn't a show coming on a cruiseship?
I cried a lot watching this.. This show has been my favorite show for many years. Thank you James Corden and the crew for making such a great show. 🙏For have given us so many great segments and memories! I have laughed many times and enjoyed all the content! I wish you James and your family all the best in the future!
my Directioner soul felt happy
Wow!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
He’s such an idiot. Good riddance. Propaganda puppet.  He, DeGeneres and the others gradually slipping away, will be lawyering up during their down time
thank you for making me happy while watching this show! we'll miss this show!!
When I watched the show for the first time, I lived in Lewes. Then I left UK, but still have watched the show from Japan. Your team have been blightened my and my friends life. I’m so happy to know you. I hope I go back to Europe and to watch your show one day.
39:27 😢
Even though I’m from Sri Lanka I have never missed a single episode of your show. I’m sad. Good bye and good luck James, I loved ur show whale as well. Hope to see you on it soon ❤😢🔥👋
Best of luck James, your family, and everyone affiliated with The Late Late Show.  You ALL did an amazing job….
i remember really loving craig ferguson as a host and had some doubts when james was taking over.  now after so many years, it proves that James created another kind of vibe for the show.  thanks for all the music and dances!
this made me more emotional than i realised.
Did the first girl Harry greet faint lmao
Thank you for putting up the full episode for international fans
history was made. Hi future viewers !
Wow It is crazy that there is no people of color that host late night, no women either. And the fact his replacement is once again another white person is crazy. Why isn’t there any POC on late night. These guys are just not funny.
I don't know what to write to give this amazing show the amazing farewell it deserves. But truly and honestly whenever i was down and low, i would turn on the clips from the show here and it would help me out of my fog!!! James is such an amazing talent and such a positive light! Thank you for all these years and all the laughs 💟🙌
Nature is healing
Good riddance
i really hope he has changed as a person and doesn’t yell at waitstaff, or treat his employees badly anymore :( hopefully he has learned his lesson
I cried!! 😢😢😢 thanks james and all the crew for so many laughs. I really liked this show, I used to see the clips here on youtube. greetings from Mexico 🇲🇽🇲🇽
this was such a great show, gonna miss it.😢😢
It means the world to us that this is his last show.
No I was just in awe when all the other talk late shows host came on 😭😭😭 aaargh! I’ve been watching you since the beginning..every show here in Aussie & man I’m gonna miss you on tv
He's just like Biden,I GOTTA FIND THE QUESTIONS!
Thank God it's over!
8:52 wow he lasted for 8 years?
omg not me thinking 1D would be the last episode 😮
🥺🇵🇭
Now the show has ended,Maybe it’s also time to end my life. Bye to this cruel world.
<3
It's about time.
I wish I could thank everyone who ran this show in person You lot helped me through the sh*t times I made very close friends bc of this show I discovered new music & comedians bc of this show Thank you
Hi James, I’m from Vietnam and have been followed your show for 8 years. Thanks so so much for bringing lots of laugh and helping me thru worst moments, you will be always my best talkshow host. Can’t wait to see your next projects. Love!
I will always remember the carpools
Goodbyes are always bittersweet 🥹❤ Hope we see more of James Corden and his team in the future.
I literally cried this whole week saying goodbye to this show :,) thank you so much for being part of our life for so long 🤧✨
Been watching the Late Late Show for decades. It has helped lift my spirits and brighten my day in so many different periods of life. James was my favorite host and vastly exceeded any expectations. He went out with a bang. Happy for James but really sad that the Late Late Show will no longer exist. Thanks for all those involved with the Late Late Show throughout the years.
Good now leave
Ok but why did I cry! We’ll miss you!
Thank You James Corden. Happy Trails to you on your next adventure. Thank you again.
I am crying a lot, thanks James. For having Harry as your guests in the last show 🥹🥹🥹🤍 good luck James!
I love this show. This is the most entertaining show I’ve seen in a while. I love you James.

This show was always a safe space for me. And for that I thank you. Best of wishes. 🩶

❤️ you James and wish you all the best!  Secretly, I have always had the hugest crush on Reggie!  Will miss you all!
Thank you, James, from your fans all over the world (I'm from Peru). Your show has cheered me up so many times, it has really been a breath of fresh air amidst so much negativity going on in the world (and particularly on the television). Best of luck in everything you do next! ♥
The world wide impact this show made!
Gay
Sitting here balling my eyes out. This show got me through so many seasons of my life and I will miss it tremendously. ❤
Thank you James for all the love, laughter, and fun you've brought into my life!!! Especially during some very tough seasons I've gone through, as many of us have, and how you've impacted us in such a positive way!!! Through your brilliant sense of humor, teaching us how we can still laugh through some difficult times and not take ourselves or life too seriously!!!😘😘😘I love you James, and wish you and your family the absolute best!!!💜🤗
Lo que entiendo es que se va de la television. Eso es cierto? y de ser asi, por que?:(
Welp guys, guess it's time to start watching Jimmy Fallon again.
The irony here is that they needed an English host to head an American Late Late show!!! Shows you just how America lacks talent
Nos dejaste los mejores recuerdos James! gracias por estos 8 años! Que lo mejor esté por venir!
Final episode 😢what??
Good Prank!
Love Light Peace 🌺🍃🌸🍃🌺🍃🌹✨✨✨✨✨✨💫
Good riddance. By far the worst late-night host.
Did anyone else see the girl pass out after Harry Styles fist bumped her or am I crazy?? 🤣
❤❤❤❤
I do hope we see more of this immensely talented man in the future!  Loved his show.  Best late night show ever!
Wow what a way to end the show. It has brought me joy, happiness and laughs for a long time. Thank you James Corden, Reggie Ian and the whole crew. Have been so sad leading up to this day but this was one epic exit and we will all miss you so much. Keep spreading love everybody!
I hope you're not biden lover!
Great job James ❤ this was an amazing show and I know we all loved it!!! ❤️☺️❣️💕🥰😘😍
As a representative of the One Direction community (Directioners), we will really miss you James. Thank you for everything you have done for us, we hate to see you go but hey, we know its something you've got 'No Control" over. See ya and good luck.  Love, Directioners :)
don't know him personally nor do i care about rumors, i liked the show and wish him well.
Bye
did anyone else see that girl faint after harry gave her a fist bump?
Thank you James❤️
Oh no, poor guy has to retire and settle down at a very early age with enormous wealth because he wants to, not because he has to. I feel so darn bad for him… give him all the car pool sympathy he’s asking for.
He was never funny nor entertaining
It’s a shame James Corden was revealed to be a giant twat. This show actually had some great skits
The ripples you set in motion are infinite and eternal.........and to leave for your truth is a ripple greater still 🧡❤💛💚💙💜🤎🖤
Damn say what no more James 😢😢
You did good James, you came in and changed the late night game. We’ll see you’re influence for years to come. Thank you for everything you’ve done 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
is he been change or the show stop?  im from indonesia..
Thank you for making me laugh all these years.   Applauds in order.  Hope to see you soon in any other platform.  Much beloved comedian 😂😊🎉
😭😭😭😢🥲🥹🫶💖🍀
James you will be so very missed in America! We wish you the best.❤❤❤
Thank you James! Loved you since the first time i've seen you! You really helped me through some rough days, while i was in the hospital after my leukemia diagnosis. You made me smile again. I know i will miss this show very much as well. Unbelievable that it's done.  This last show has been a very beautiful tribute and ending! ❤
💜
About time
God bless you, James. Thank you for all of the laughs, the kindness, and bringing your joy to America. We'll miss you and wish you all the best in London! ❤
Who cares
I only watched snippets so hopefully I can binge watch! Love this man, good luck to him!
Yes finally that douche bag’s show is over!
So gonna miss u Ur so rite there is more in common then not amongst us earth beings😊
I am so sad ending😂 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂❤
Ugh thank goodness...the overrated ego has left the building!
I’m going to miss you, James❤❤😂😂😂
I love you so much
I have really enjoyed your show so much.  I will miss you, your cast, and your show.  All the best as you turn the page to a new chapter.
Yall can hate on this man for being rude at restraunts or seeming entitled or stuck up to complete strangers as much as you want but consider before that how much laughter n happiness he has brought to YOU and your family and maybe considering thanking him instead .
At least Jimmy Fallon isn’t quitting
First conan and now James...ugh. 😢
I'm crying and this is the only episode I've ever watched lol. I hate goodbyes. 🥲
Never watched it
Thank you James for making me feel comfortable to watch this American TV show eventhough most of the time I didn’t understand the topic or didn’t get the joke, but I really enjoyed watching James bcs he really have a pure heart and could always enlighten the room. May your shine will remains wherever you are ✨
The end of an era.. Ending with Harry is perfect, and i'm grateful for all the many memories i will keep with me throughout my life PS : Thankful for having the JoBros, once again, in the last episodes
God that is cringe. Especially that ridiculous song at the end. Spew
Beautiful 🥰🤩
Craig Ferguson was the best host of the late late show.   James Corden is just a try hard.  He's not funny.  I watched one with James episode, and it put me to sleep
Class
saddest sh!t since one direction broke up. love you so much james ❤️❤️
i’m not crying you’re crying
You did it your way!
can anyone talk about the girl who fainted after harry greeted her???????
Thank fuck
So happy you started this show and it's been going for the last 8 years. It has honestly brought me so much joy.
I can’t believe it’s over. I remember when the show was first starting and I had no idea who he was. I questioned the decision to choose James as the host. However I quickly learned he was not only perfect for the job, but one of my favorite to ever do it. I’m sad to see it end, but I’m great full for the time we shared
If will ferrer shows up in your last day it's prolly the best
Thank u James for all the good memories. I speak Spanish and your show helped me to improve my English. I love your charisma and I wish you best in your future projects. Love from 🇵🇦🇵🇦🇵🇦Thank u. #Godblessu
What a genius way to end the beautiful show,, I can't hold my tears ❤️❤️❤️
Thank you James and the crew who made this phenomenal show that has brought us lots of joyfulness. 💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
This show helped me during my low times
The end of the greatest era of late night shows
Good luck in all that you do in the future, Mr. Corden.  YOU WILL BE MISSED SERIOUSLY!
Yay Ferguson can come back a true talent!!!
Good riddance you rotund goblin
ILY HARRYY
🥺🥺 i was expecting a one direction comeback
All those people celebrating him can’t stand him…he is not a good person…
We will miss this...
Wow that was emotional... Thank you James and to your staff as well 😍😍😍
This is some real Big James Energy! The enthusiasm and charisma just exuberates from him continuously.
Where is Conan?
I cannot stop crying
A lovely ending song...I am sorry to see you go.

I was a huge fan of the show when Craig Ferguson was the host, and I wasn't familiar with James Corden at all. And now, 8 years later, I'm sad to see James leave. I can't wait to see what he does going forward, good luck James!
Dear James and crew of The Late Late Night Show: Thank you for all your work and dedication to making these past 8 years memorable for so many of us. May the next chapter of your lives bring you abundant prosperity, joy, love and peace. -Best wishes from your Canadian friend xo
❤

All of you kids are talented in most things you do as a performer. My apologies for not watching most Shows. I am a movie freak and love films. I watch films every night. I am sure you will find another job James Cordon, you have made so many friends and you are a lovely person.
😭😭😭
❤❤❤❤

Bonne route à toi James Corden, merci à toute l’équipe pour tous ces délicieux moments, tous ces rires et intenses émotions qui, ce soir, tard, très tard, emplissent mes yeux de chaudes larmes et disent tout ce que ressens ❤❤❤😭💕💕💕🎶❤️💕😘
While I'm no fan of Corden and find the guy to be an insufferable twat, I quite enjoyed it when Craig Ferguson was host. Regardless, it's sad to see the Late Late Show ending for good.
Thanks for the many laughs James. Wish you and your family all the best ❤
Who the hell is James Corden ?  Never heard of him.
Good luck James!!!😢🎉❤
I'm gonna miss you soooo much!! Big warm hug from Costa Rica! Love you James Corden ❤
The best to you James & your family  in your new journey. You will be truly missed

Thank you James!!!!!!!!!!

You are my favorite host James! Wish you happiness. From 🇲🇳 Mongolia ❤
Thank you, James
10:27 how embarrassing for the US 🙈
Thanks for your time!
Will he take over the GRAHAM NORTON SHOW in Britain ?
From all of us, thank you so much James Corden for bringing many smiles and laughter and love to many people around the world during times we needed it most.
Oh ffs !!!!! Cringe !
I’ve cried because this show was so much fun to watch, so joyful and so blissful. I hope one day James would come back…
James where can I watch you now❤️
The people in the audience reacting to Harry fist bumping them is too funny
The show will be missed.
Good luck man
Love you James!!! Awesome show!! Thank you for 1200 🤗🥰🤗🥰
Obrigado por providenciar momentos divertidos onde apenas o estresse e o caos reinavam, seja durante a pandemia, nos dias ruins do trabalho e até mesmo na luta contra o câncer. Siga em frente! Boa sorte James!
Perfection!!
So does this mean the whole show   is going to be taken over by another host or what? Are they also going to removed the episodes from youtube? No way !!!!😅😂😢😮
Wait!!!! I literally  come for the news jingle. You mean on the last day he didn't go all out?!?! Aww man
Terrible start to his last show
This comment section is so fucking botted, I'm here to level it out by saying fuck you James.
You watch when the media stops going on about harry styles he will start wanting to be like a sam smith dressing up as women and tbat to stay in the press
Thank you... my favourite bit was when you rented a double decker bus and toured Prince Harry around town. You have been a joy to watch and good luck as you return home. (Ruby from Alberta Canada)
The king is gone but  not forgotten. Your the man. Thanks James for  making me laugh for so many years. A true legend. Good luck on your journey.
Good bye James we love you. Let the light carry you forward
this show has made me laugh countless times. thank you james for your contribution to making millions of people happy. goodluck and enjoy the well deserved time with your family!
Its not too late to wish you and your family well, James! Thanks for all the laughs, the carpooling, and your sheer talent will be so missed!
Ah CRAP!!!!! That’s great, just great🤦🏽‍♀️…So What happens when I’m famous in a few years huh?… I can’t be on the show now. Ughhh I hate my life!!!!  10 years…that’s all I needed..
Thought it was suppose to be a gd episode lol
Now bye!
Made enough money to retire back to the English countryside i suppose.
The show was a disgrace
Love James and will miss the show
This feels so dystopian.
What is of value to you? Prove that girthed your loins.  i am also Matthew 12:26. i confuse demons, nonunless they attack me.  You battle demons till you leave Earth or they own you child.  HE needs you more than you need you. Amen. Alleluia.
He ran a lot and climbed so many stairs that I thought he was changing his profession to how to break down doors.  Really funny show and so much fun.  My dream of appearing on his show probably won't come true, but good luck in the future 🥺😃
It has been 8 years of energy,fun & laughter!
Thank you for all the good memories James ! Cheers
James was ok but the rest of the cast was incredible
Thank you James! It’s been a ride….Loved the BTS shows and the Crosswalk Concert with BTS!   Job well done will miss you❤️
A ROYAL close to your show James. Thanks for the years of smiles & laughs.
I don’t understand why the show is ending…
i love watching you Thank you for all the fun episodes
Thank God it's over
Thank you James and the whole crew!! God Bless🥰🥰🥰🥰
Well if it wasn't for James himself the show mightve survived. Kinda hard to let oneself be entertained by a guy that has a personality of a rabid porcupine in public but a fake ass one on TV. Im filled up on hypocrisy
It wasn’t the funniest talkshow on TV📺, but it was definitely the show with the most fun. Thanks to the whole team. And good luck with your future.
Jimmy maybe you can be in a musical for Pfizer.
Care to apologize for trying to abolish our 2nd amendment Limey?
Ahh I knew I'd cry! Gonna miss this show so much 😢 but I hope James sets up another show similar in the UK or work on Gavin and Stacey again. Love you James, thanks for making us laugh and for spreading happiness 😊
My Heavens. A masterclass in how to bow out with poise, grace, and class. Gd bless, James. Thank you, and bravo!
Going to miss him!!!
James and everyone at the show. A huge thank you, for getting many of us through some very rough times. Your light will shine on for ever. So much love to all of you. 💞🦋🎉👍
Congratulations James 💐 A beautiful ending to your last show and paying tribute to all the people that were behind the scenes. Thank you for all the laughs ❤️🇦🇺
Where's Harry's rings?!
I will miss your show especially carpool karaoke!!! Wishing you all the best. Please come back often.
the next Nobel Prize is for YOU ... Luv 🤩
From one Brit to another  - well done, James. A brilliant ending. You did us and yourself proud. Good luck in the future.
Bye 🖕🏾
😢
Wait this is the last show like video?
This was so much fun. Best of luck to you and your family going forward. ❤Loved❤❤👏🏽👏🏽👋🏽
Thank you James!
Thank God he's obnoxious
well done!!!
im gonna miss this show 😭
Can someone tell me why it’s ending?
Every time When I remember James cordon I will never forget how you treated staff members and others in public such a nice guy breaks my heart 🥹                                               😂
Isn't cosmetic surgery priceless? Yes. It is defined WORTHLESS and a joke that makes you a better person.
I love that one of the big reasons people hate him today was because of a story that broke out where James was with  Harry and he carried on like an ass while Harry was very kind.
I had tears knowing that this was the last show thank you for the tears of laugher during times I didn’t think I could laugh …we will miss you 😢❤😂
How's your wife and kids
We will miss you❤!
Im from Germany and rarely watch any TV Shows not even german ones, but to be honest, yours was like for real the only show i  watched if  i had time and it always made me laugh.  I hope you come back sometime  and continue these ideas like carpool or street musicals, these just were  genius ideas. Thanks
Thank you all at the Late Late show with James Corden for the happiness you brought to us. Blessed be your new paths in life!
Colbert next. Then Kimmel and Fallon.
People do HIS Will or not. No award or adoration is needed from others. The first Commandment, "No other gods besides me.". This World is so blind that i thinks it has a guarantee to Heaven. i am the late call, "NEVer!".  HE ALONE IS TO BE ADORED.  Even the demons prostrated to our Lord Jesus Christ.  "6 𝓒𝓪𝓽𝓬𝓱𝓲𝓷𝓰 𝓼𝓲𝓰𝓱𝓽 𝓸𝓯 𝓙𝓮𝓼𝓾𝓼 𝓯𝓻𝓸𝓶 𝓪 𝓭𝓲𝓼𝓽𝓪𝓷𝓬𝓮, 𝓱𝓮 𝓻𝓪𝓷 𝓾𝓹 𝓪𝓷𝓭 𝓹𝓻𝓸𝓼𝓽𝓻𝓪𝓽𝓮𝓭 𝓱𝓲𝓶𝓼𝓮𝓵𝓯 𝓫𝓮𝓯𝓸𝓻𝓮 𝓗𝓲𝓶," [Mark 5:6]  The horn of Babylon has risen. i am Nephilim.
Whats the reason that the show is finishing ?
Go woke...GO BROKE.
This show was my life, it helped me through out  the years im gonna miss it so much but im very happy that i found out about this show. The carpool karaokes we're my fav. Sending so much love, thank you so much
Thanks James and staff for one of the best late night shows probably ever. Your genuine laughter and especially your singing and brilliant ideas( carpool karaoke, crosswalk theatre.) we’re amazingly entertaining. May you be blessed in all of your endeavours!
How did biden manage to string a sentence together
Thank you for giving me laughter and joy when I was having a bad day and for making me smile despite the hard times. The creativity of the team on this show is unmatched and I applaud you for being so unique and for allowing us to see the crew behind the scenes of it all. I'm gonna miss Rob, Ben, Nick, Ian, Reggie, Winnie, Steve's news jingle, and of course James for always giving it your all with every show. So many great memories and sketches (I always do the dance when No Control comes on) :) ! I'm sad to see you go, but I understand why you have to and I will always come back to this show if I need a laugh! Wishing you all the best in what the future holds and thank you for everything!
Making people laugh is the best gift ever ❤❤
Thank god! Nobody won’t miss your ass my guy. I hope you stay out of movies and tv series lol. You’re ready of a human being and it’s sad the way you treat the lower class. Goodbye and don’t let the door hit you on the way out lmao
I loved this show! It's so sad it has to end
Why are pets and animals seen and treated better than a many children in just the USA? The con artists, the worms, have you convinced that you actually know what love is about. Spiked your cereal.
Thank you so much James and the crew 🎉
till next time :) end of a generational show🙏🏽💔
I'm crying with tears of sadness and yet with a joy in knowing that I got to enjoy so many nights with this man and his shenanigans. A special thank you to everyone that made this show I don't think anybody will ever be able to replace him. Your reason for leaving leaving gives me great respect and loyalty for your love of your family and your children. You are a good man and you will be missed.
bye
Thank you James, for absolutely everything, the memories i made laughing and enjoying all the content, you have made an impact on my life more than you will ever know.
Thank you James for all the many needed laughs and the love. Late night will not be the same. Bless you and your family ❤
The Late Late Show was my favorite of all night shows.  I am misty that he is leaving his show and America. Do all of you agree that he got a huge offer to have his Late Show in his native country?  Give your thoughts…..
Great show but Craig did it the best.
10:56 the “late night talking” pj🥹🥹
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
The World is in the Late Late Show. i the warn. Time is up, something coming down. All around, no one wanting to be.
Thanks for sticking around as long as you did James. Have fun and enjoy your time off.❤️
Thanks for all, like, legit
finally it was about time
Dear Late Late Show…we love you and thank you for all the laughs. Times I went through that James could just make it all better. Thank you so much!!!! We love and miss you!!!❤❤❤
Sleepy Joe 🙄
Love you and I will miss you ❤
Ok now blast him into the sun
Whatta great ride this show has been! You were all like family to me! Wishing you all the best is hard to do when someone is cutting onions. ♥️♥️♥️
Thank you james
James is incredible and will be missed.
❤😢So sad to see this show end. 💔I’m going to miss you.
❤ love u harry
oh i will sure miss you james corden and your beautiful interactions with Harry Styles🥹 we love how you love him🫶🏼
FINALLY!!!
😢😢😢
You had me bawling. Thank you so much for this show, it brought everybody lots of joy ❤
if james cordon can’t make a 1D reunion happen no one can 😭
The beginning stunt, stuck in the stairway, is dramatically and artistically correct.  Humans are mostly imprisoned outside of their hearts [spiritual one]. i am the menace that knows. HE WHOM IS showed me, me. Jeremiah 17:9.
CBS doesnt remenber Craig Ferguson?
where’d the second desk come from 29:23 took me 3 times to realise there’s another desk.
Honestly the best TV late night host in a long time. No fake reactions and he is the most articulate of them all.
Never watched before... And kinda happy I didn't as I could NOT deal with with wooping audience all night, jeez!, Reign it in America!
We will miss you soooooo sooooo much James you are our light, the most funny, talented, humble person. Love from France ❤️
Lol😂so funny
L O S E R
Thank you for the joy you never missed to point out and show personally no matter how dark and pointless life seemed to be for thousands of people.  You are a bundle of what a good person can look like.  Thank you for your hard work and for sharing points of love in the world.
Thank God
Thank you for 8 great years of The Late Late Show filled with humor and joy, James Corden. It's been an absolute blast. Wishing you all the best in the future. #ThankYou #JamesCorden
Oh James i am gonna mis your Shows Sir ! I wish you all the best for your return and your Future🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻❤❤❤🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻big hugs from Belgium Brussels and take care of you and your Family ❤❤
❤❤❤
Thank god it’s finally over
😢😢😢😢😢😢
I will miss this show you're best comedian james 😢😢😢😢 ❤ you're real jem .
I am sorry Will Farrell is the worst
I can't believe I'm crying because I don't weep easily. But this did it. Thanks to everyone involved with this show. I hope you all go on to do great things. I won't forget you.
This cancel culture thing is bullshit. We all know one of the biggest reasons he is walking away is because of all the cancel culture crap. Even millions of dollars aren't worth sticking around to deal with that. It sucks the show is ending. I never really watched it regularly, but when I did watch it, I was always entertained. Will definitely miss this show. Trevor Noah first and now James Corden.
Wow Harrys bodylanguage just screams 2011. It makes me warm inside. He is humble and genuin and still little shy though with all his success. I think we were able to see a little of the "true" Harry here and not just the "perfomer". His little speech were so vulnerable and honest and I think Harry and James are better friends than ive already thaught. Im gonna miss carpool karaoke😪
38:48 I’m not crying, you’re crying 😢 so sad to see a show and people who brought so much joy to my life for so many years, take their final bow. Thank you @latelateshow
What a load of self congratulatory nonsense.
His socks were so wrong!!!!!
Thank god it s over
I can’t help but think none of it is genuine and it’s all because of his bad press lately
Full of bull…
lol thank fucking god finally
It was a plessure.Thanks!
😢I miss u already, u are so entertaining to watch. Loved ur car concerts with various musicians. Please stay!❤
This show of this fat, gay man was amazing. It was cool for me to practice my English
Does anybody know the reason & why & what for that James Corden is leaving his show? Please please someone tell me!
I can meet you in NYC? where do you do the recording?
Thank you James Corden ❤!! You and the Late Late Night show have always been brilliant. We will miss you !! Enjoy your life with family and your beloved ones. ❤
Good riddance, would be nice if he could create a vacuum to take the other late night dipshts with him.
Fins Up!! 😭😭😭😭
Thank you. For stopping
Corden, Colbert, Fallon, Kimmel, Myers...  Are really the same person if you close your eyes.  It's like the Democrat Party issues nightly, state-sanctioned talking points.
James Gorden the last shaaaaaaauuuuu😎
*R.I.P.  JAMES  CORDEN,  JERRY SPRINGER.  4/29/2023*
*CONAN  O'BRIAN  COMING  BACK  2023!!*
I think the way Styles is dressed is just gorgeous. The cut, the design, everything is impeccable xox
Harry Styles, please sign me, I'm a SPOTIFY artist!!!
Wow!! His speech was so inspiring & all I did was cry like a baby... Good Luck, James, on your next journey to bigger & better things!! You'll truly be missed on The Late Late!! You are an amazing human being... Great Song!! You have so much talent in stored within your mind. Wish I could meet you I person one day... you are just AWESOME!! MUCH LOVE TO YOU & YOURS FROM ALABAMA, TO L.A., BACK TO LONDON!! Don't forget about us over here... Bye for now but never forever!! ❤
This was awesome. I just wish they had Conan too in the late night host sketch.
The end of something beautiful
James had an amazing run!
Why is he leaving? Where is he going? Why is this his last show?
All other late night hosts have a family I think he knew his snobby reputation was catching up to him and that's why he quit Not because he wants to be with his family
I loved the team. Mr Corden not so much.
don’t know how sad it is.. that the only and first full show the last is… from Europe!  ive enjoyed ALL clips/Bits and shows all the years - thank you James and crew !!!
Late Night With Craig Ferguson was better ‼️
For the whole 8 years he never made it to the town of Chillingbourne.
James  Gordon love your humour🎉
Ahh I wasn't ready. What a beautiful send-off. The Late Late Show will definitely be missed!! We love you James!
he is so full of himself
Why is he leaving the show can anybody tell me?
Everyone will miss You James ❤️ You are a wonderful person! So sad that I am not gonna see more Carpool Karaoke with You, or Spill your Guts and of course the Celebrity Noses 👃  If it's possible, please make every show from these past 8 seasons available to watch in Poland. Have a good and safe flight to England :)
James Corden, you're fantastic. But please remember, it's just TV. Not the world. Not really importent.
Thank you James for all the times you made my day❤️ i will miss watching your show, you were the best show in America, great humor great laughs, i kept on watching some episodes again and again from how its filled with laughter and excitement. Thank you for everything. Love from Oman🇴🇲❤️
Obrigado! 😢
James and everyone that worked on the show, THANK YOU for all the laughs and unforgettable moments.
An end of an era...you'll always be staying in our hears, James Corden!!!
*BLOWS KIMMEL SHOW AWAY,  BLOWS FERGUSON OFF THE AIR.* *WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD THEY CUT THE BEST LATE NIGHT SHOW??*
This show began when I started secondary school and now we graduate together Thank You so much for the countless smiles!!
So many laughs….crosswalks we’re the best!!
*WHY WAS SHOW CLOSING?  SHOW WAS GREAT.  ANYONE KNOW WHY OFF THE AIR??*
Don’t let the door hit you in your well fed arse on the way out
😢
That song was beautiful. Loved the karaoke too. Good advice to us, James. Let's come together and not tear each other apart.
Well done all involved. Its been entertaining as hell.
Because of him i got into bts army loves you i wish him well 💜💜💜💜💜💜
And Conan?
Great run gang! Can't wait to see what James will do next.
Finally that Asshole is gone !!!
...ITS SO SAD, IT WAS THE BEST TV SHOW ON THE PLANET...EVER!! RESPECT JAMES!!!!!
Loved this show, love James, but am sad for all the crew...   what will they all do ???     Good luck to all!!!😢
Congratulations 🎊
Really bummed at myself that I didn’t tune in more frequently to watch your show brother! Congratulations on your success and beautiful words from you about our country! Thank you! ❤👍🏻🇺🇸
Most iconic show!!
Love you James! I wish you, your family and the staff and theirs the best of wishes in whatever path life takes you all ❤🎉
Lol but where’s Jay Leno? 😂😂😂
Love that guy.
So his child born in USA? So she or he is American, wonder if his child would  have dual nationality
i still can’t believe this show ended. even with my dysfunctional and slightly toxic family, when it came to watching the late late show or carpool karaoke, everything seemed okay, we all seemed okay. i’m so thankful for this show as it made everything feel better, for a while anyways before it all went crazy again. sure as hell made us laugh too. 8 years of this. so many memories. thank you for making life slightly better.
That song brought tears down my face. Beautiful song and best wishes.
Love love love this man😂🥰❤️ god bless you. Going to miss you nightly 😢 but happy ur doing what you want!!🙏❤️
I hope everything goes well in England James! Thank you for putting smiles on our faces when we needed it 🫶🏼
Not a great specimen of a human
Finally this show sucks
Is he crying about what ? leaving  the show ?!
Goodbye James Cordon.. hope to hear from you
And not a moment too soon. James needs to be cordened off
James you did very well! thank you! 🎉.
Did that girl at 17:50 faint when Harry fist bumped her?
Thank you for years of laughs, crosswalk musicals and most especially for carpool karaokes!!! Brilliant! Will you be back in England in time for the King's Coronation? Wishing you, your family and all of your LLS team the best! Looking forward to the good trouble you all get into next!
By the way - this is also the end of the "Late Late Show" franchise as a whole. There will be no more hosts succeeding him or anyone replacing him. Tom Snyder, Craig Kilborn, Craig Ferguson and finally James Corden. It's over :(
And he will be back to UK and what he will be doing next ?
I love this show got me through 2020 Good luck James wished you weren't leaving thank you so much
I hope you bring joy and making me laugh as well I'm really so proud of you
Thanks for the laughs and memories james
Did anyone else notice the girl who looked like she fainted after knuckle bumping Harry styles 😂😂
I was fine until I saw Ian crying.
The fuck the Harry styles wearing 😅
now bring back Craig Ferguson
Show was good til you had Biden on
Thank you James, thank you for bringing laughs! I’m gonna miss you so much😢 from 🇮🇩
We love you James. From Kenya 🇰🇪
Thank you james, thank you everyone involved in the show. Watching through YouTube from spain, this show is the best talk show, and it always will be.
Thank God.
What??
That was so much fun watching this show, gonna miss it.
Te imaginamos James
Thanks James… 11:38
Yas love that Will Ferrel said that Seth is the best late night host, he just is 🙌🏻🙌🏻 #jackals
thanks for making me smile every single day, no matter what happened
soo wierd that they are all white and man
So sad to see them go… we always felt like we were a part of it; James created an intimacy that felt like family.  Peace on you and yours.
When this show came, my dog passed away, and I was leaving an abusive relationship. I completely enjoyed the show, and it helped me get through long, lonely nights. Now, I've been married for 4 years with an amazing man. Thank you for the Late Late Show James. Best wishes to you and your family. You made me laugh, and millions of others,too. Blessing
We getting you back James  Uk
Thank you James ... your show completed life ... ❤❤❤❤
Such nice words to try to bring a country together
Im suprised biden even got through that speech lol. Bet they have some woke bullshit replaced him. Thats the sad part.
I’m gonna miss you so much but I wish you the very best. Thank you James
LOVE YOU JAMES!
It's one of those videos I know I will watch a lot more times in the future. And I'll always have chills. And I'll always ask myself: why the desk repaired itself after guest segment.  ❤❤❤
Thx 4 all the legendary moments we could have spent with you James ❤
1D FOR LIFE
To hear Will Ferrell, however briefly, speak so earnestly about the success of another was truly shocking and heartwarming to me!
And ....?
Radiohead 💕🎶
Thank you for making me cry james😭😭😭
We will miss you here in the US, but I'm sure you'll start another great show there.
Thank you James and staff and crew for bringing love and laughter into this world when we needed it most! Good luck in all you do next!
we miss you already buddy!😌🥲😔
One more Gavin and Stacey then? 😎
Thank God. James was awful
‘Look for the Joy.”❤❤And that’s what I’ve always felt whenever I’ve watched this show with JC.🎉
Wat a story to tell wen james meets som old mates in the pub on Sunday in London uk    wen one says "aint seen you in yrs how ya doing mate"      gavin n Stacey  to  TLLS-   incredible 👏
im gonna miss this show n james tooo!!❤❤❤
Noooo
I will miss here in Africa. You are such a joker
this show always felt like a warm hug. thank you so much!!
Now it's time for the stories to come out 🤬
🤍
I watched this show religiously during the covid lockdowns, it was fantastic. As soon as they went back to a studio audience, I stopped watching because it was back to the same old crap.
I don't know why but this feels like a One Direction hiatus part 2😢
I MISS YOU SOOOOOOO MUCH AND YOU MADE ME CRY I LOVE YOU
James you have done great
You are the reason why I became an ARMY after watching the Carpool Karaoke with BTS. Thank you James! I will miss working from home with your shows on the side.
I just don't want it to end 😭
Thank you all for all the joy you brought to my life. Greetings from Czech Republic. Love you guys. 🥲❤
it takes a man to quit on the peak, well done man, wish you many fruitful years with ur family. btw, this was the first your show ive watched. it was really good ;)
Nicht eine Träne kaufe ich dem ab! Aber schöne Show mit Tollen Momenten.
thank god its over
James and Crew ALL OF YOU behind the scenes,THANK YOU FOR ALL THE GREAT NIGHTS  and laughter. I will miss you all, all the ad libs from the band musical and otherwise. And I'm glad you didn't ask  Pres Biden to sing too! I look forward to hearing and seeing you on stage in some  capacity. Good night James an CARRY ON!!
This looks like similar to JamesCordenMan from the LateLateVerse
You don’t realize how much late night hosts make your reality a bit more peaceful in life. I didn’t watch your show every night but your bits and humor always made me smile. Thank you james❤
Damn the ending made me ball my eyes out
Best final show i' ever seen!
Thank you James and the entire Late Late show team for bringing a piece of happiness and joy. 🌸
We will miss you
This is unbelievable, thanks to YouTube I encountered James (I’m from Turkey and you’re a celeb here too ❤) and for so many you made me laugh, happy with your show. Even in my bad days you were able to put a smile on my face 😊 thank you for so many great memories 🙏 although a part of me is angry cause you’re leaving, my soul senses that you earned this and have the right to spend time with your family, but just don’t forget  about this family you have around the world, ok? I love you James, hope you’ll see this, wishing you the best 🙏 May God makes you laugh and happy too, just as you made us 🙏🙏🙏❤️🇹🇷
Finally! I hope they never let him leaving UK again.
Endings are hard, I think Craig Ferguson got it right making his goodbye a joyous affair, full of laughs and humour. I think making it this big sob fest smells of ego but maybe that’s just me
they should have added Conan. he's a talk show host too.
he will always be my favorite talk show host
Thank god this is over. I heard how terrible he is and I'm glad he's gone now.
The God and MayFlower it's over
Thank you James Corden! Especially loved your episodes with Tom Cruise!!!!
We'll miss you James. You leave our TVs and our country a bit less funny. Blessings to you and yours.
Let's go Brandon
You know, I knew nothing about the show before covid. Then I discovered this banter-filled chaos, and it was the next best thing from the corona era after my second son’s birth.  Then I learned all this stuff about James being a horrible person etc etc. You know what? Either (a) this is just the usual media-enhanced drama crap, or (b) James is a REALLY good actor because everything about the show (at least the monos) looks super authentic.   And, well, having seen bits of Cats, I seriously doubt James is such a good actor. Which leaves us with (a). At least that’s what I choose to believe.
Thanks so much! I wish you wellness and peace.
I really wish James and Nick would have had one more little bit together.
Will genuinely miss this show. Thank you James and the entire team for 8 years of incredible work. Excited to see where you go from here! 💜
As someone once told me  “this is the end of one chapter and the beginning of another”.
Werde die Show vermissen. Habe oft "nur" Clips und Auszüge gesehen, aber diese jedes mal gern. Von Carpool Karaoke habe ich sicher auch jede Folge gesehen! Oft sehr lustig, emotional, spannend und toll anzuschauen und anzuhören! Da liefen auch ist paar Tränen beim anschauen. 🥹 Bin gespannt ob wir weiter von James etwas hören und sehen.. Wäre schön ! 😁💪🏻🙏 Alles Liebe. Grüße aus Deutschland 😁♥️
Glad he is Gone.😊
I've been an avid fan of the show from the very beginning and seeing it's last episode after all those years of laugher and joy that it brought me by just watching it on YouTube still feel surreal. I hate and love it at the same time. 😢😢
Gracias James ! 😢
The first full episode I've ever seen. Greetings from Europe, I hope the BBC grabs you James!
the former president wouldn't have been part of the last show.
Always the same lame answer about a 1D reunion… i dont think that will happen! Why should he? He is so succssesfull!
hold on did he mean sign of the times as the album
i’m 18 so i didn’t get to start watching late night shows until like 2016 and this show and this show has always been my favorite from the skits to games to carpool karaoke, it’s always been the best. james and jimmy fallon always had my fav personalities.
"We are more the same than we are different." ❤
Just imagine your boss make you stand in line an clap and cheer for him....and somehow top that with placing a black man near and ready,just for THAT handshake!! Cool,cool !!
Stop right now this was so sad
There's never been a show like this. EVER. And there never will be one again EVER.
Hopefully Corden will learn to be a better person away from the Tom Cruises and Harry Styles of the world and treat service people with respect instead of being the gross entitled little prick he's been in the past.
you - and your team - made up so many fresh ideas to the Late Show....thank you soooo much....I was crying while you leaving, just to know there will be no more show.....thanks a lot to you and your team for these fantastic moments....love to all of you !
Love love love you and your family i was glad when your dad was there we have seen him before❤️❤️❤️❤️🇩🇰🇩🇰❤️❤️❤️❤️You are the best and you are doing the best thing❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Im crying so bad yall don't even know. Thank YOU James for everything, I grew up watching this show and I will forever miss it.
À bientôt à Londres James, emmène harry avec toi je pense qu'il a bien besoin de rentré chez les siens qui l'aime et le respecte,  pas comme tout c'est malade qui on traînés HARRY dans la boue aux howards en février, tout sa pour avoir un truc de plus à posé sur leurs cheminée ils n'arriveront jamais à la cheville de ce chanteur si gentils avec un cœur énorme qui aime et respecte ces fanes par dessus tout, et comme il l'a fait comprendre au public ce jour là, si il existe c'est avant tout grâce à toutes ces personnes qui aiment sa musique achètent ces CD et DVD, et bien sur qui viennent le voir en concert dans le monde entier, bravo HARRY merçi et surtout reste toujours toi même, pas comme tout c'est cons et connes qui ont tous pris la grosse tête, gros bousous bousous d'une mamie de France qui t'admire 🧓🇫🇷.   💋💙🌹🤴🦋💙💋👏👏👏🐦🐦🐰🐰✌️✌️✌️
I’ll miss this show, but what a great run it has been! Fins up!
Je suis très triste 😢 du départ de James Corden.  Il est tellement talentueux. J'espère le revoir à  la télé, je l'apprécie beaucoup.  Au revoir James, je vous souhaites bonheur et joie...xo

Nobody really cares!
Thank you so much for all these years of fun and emotions that you gave me. I will remember it forever ❤

💓

We thank you and the amazing staff for helping us forget about problems and laugh and bring joy at the end of a hard day. We could never watch the live show but definitely saw so many on YouTube.  May our Heavenly Father guide you and the staff onto the next projects and we look forward to seeing you again and following you as always.  Love you from South Florida. ❤ PS: our favorite was the Carpool Karaoke and the crosswalk shows and we would always say please come do a crosswalk in our neighborhood!!! LOL

Best of luck James!
James I have always loved you from gavin and Stacey, ALOTO (if you know you know) and watching all your sketches etc on YouTube from the late late show. Just want to say I’m (we’re) proud from England and it’s great your coming home.
Hurting earth and innocent animals are evil thing that people could do you just have to tell the difference of evil and what people say or do think their own mind that's how it works or universe works but I doubt it they are right they're wrong for sure let's face it But go follow God's words what he wants or needs us to do to spread his words and positivity
Welcome back home to England, United Kingdom, James Corden.  From one of your fellow British Citizens from Birmingham, England.  I enjoyed watching your show as well.  Some of it was very entertaining such as Fill Your Guts or Spill Your Guts.  Just be grateful for the extremely rare opportunity that you have had to live & work in The USA as a TV talk show host.  Not many people get this opportunity to do this type of job.  And a bloody good job as well.  Getting paid millions to interview famous people.  I would love to do that for free.  I wish you all the best for the future.
James off doing more stupid dances to promote the dangerous experimental injections?
I will miss you ande the show so much!!! This was so amazing show !!! ❤
This is an ARTIST. Those were real artisans of their craft. What a last episode…cried thick tears at the very end, just powerful and vulnerable souls doing their art. Thank you, from a non native English speaker who really enjoyed your show, from other corner of the world 🇨🇴
I have mix emotions and a lot to say 🇬🇧🇺🇸 🥺😪 ❤️🙏🏻💯
I can’t stop crying this was the best way to end the show,  James you’re gonna stay forever as my favourite Host ❤❤
Thank God.  What a mess
harry kissing the bald mans head AHAHAHAA
Thank u James...❤
sad its ending 🥲 good luck for the future! thanks for all the amazing carpool karaokes, fill your guts and funny segments! gonna miss this 😭🥲
Never thought he could make me cry❤️love you james..i miss you already ❤️
we will always love you james.
Im pretty sure its not the last time we will see HIM.
I will miss you, so much.❤😢
sad 🥲
U know, all things considered. Maybe Harry will take over the late late show? hes done it before and it worked out. and he's here now? idk if its decided yet but if not maybe?
Most nights, this show is the last thing i see...
😢😢😢
Congratulations James on such a successful and fun filled show I know you’ll go on to doing better things I wish you all the best thank you so much for filling my life with positive laughter i will miss you but will carry the memories close in my heart take care James and the late late show your friend for life samuel.🌈💜🎼😎
i am crying i love james and this show so much
Why can't Harry Styles just dress like a normal man? I guess he just has to have the attention. Sort of like Billy Porter. Talented people don't need to do this get get attention. Next it will be the STUPID pro-noun stuff they will be using. Just one mans opinions. Bring on the nasty comments...I can take it.
James Corden... you are really an amazing human being.  Thank you again for what you said to America and for your humbleness and sincerity!  I love you!  :)
Well that was sweet.  Thanks for you work, James.  Good on you.
Well done to a great show.
did someone see the girl faint when harry fistbumped him..
❤
What a special final episode ❤. I got to meet Reggie recently when he visited UNT, so I'm devastated I won't be seeing him kick it with the band on these online clips anymore. I will miss James and all of the late night crew! During the pandemic episodes, we really got to know the crew and their humor styles, who was "peeved" at who, the bits that ran too long but it was perfect, and a Closer Look at the staff that was such a comfort during those early pandemic months. I will sincerely miss the Late Late Show with James Corden, and though this feeling is bittersweet, I can't wait to see what everybody does next. Best wishes to ALL that have been a part of this show's affect of bringing great joy to the audience at home.
11:15 my wallpaper for a couple of days
saw James the first time in the movie with keira knightly and Adam Levine and he has really done so great.  Well done James❤
Awesome video, thanks
Crying since it started!!
Good riddance.
I’m gonna miss this soo much 😢😭
Can we get some love for Reggie!??Dude will be missed. Can’t wait to see what you do next!
Use me as a sad button
You will be missed, James and Team. Thank you for all of the beautiful moments, inspiration, and more. We are indebted to you.
Is it true hes an ass?
Crying right now
Somebody should do a compilation of all the fake on the brink of tears, quiver voices all these late night talk show hosts have adopted over the past few years. Jimmy fallon, Jimmy kimmel and this guy are the worst
I will be watching old YT clips of carpool karaoke!  I loved it too.  Best of luck moving back home and I know your family will be so happy.
Job well done James... The World is your oyster ... bEST WISHES from the Emerald Isle ... ☘
One hell of an episode. All the late night hosts in one was amazing and perfect.
For me a person who lives outside America YouTube was the only way to watch the show, I'm just gonna miss it all😢😢😢
James, you are so talented and soulfull❤ Whatever you do in your carreer will be successfull.
this was very emotional for me...i recently lost my dad to cancer and a couple of childhood friends have passed as well after that and watching this made me feel so hopeful for some reason...there is always an end to a beginning and things keep changing... as is life..
ABSOLUTE LEGEND 😭😭
Where is tucker carlson ? If he had shown up to i dont know what ?? Lol ! 😁😇😂🤣
Glad this annoying, unfunny hack is off the air.
F in chat for the show
Thanks to all The Late Late Show team and James in particular. Great time!!!
I actually cried in your last number - I feel for you and really look forward to your next phase here where you really belong! Well done - a great gig!
Kiss the screen in tears... Thanks also to the Graphic Artists and Editors...Great CBS!   What a Joy 😂😂😂❤❤❤!
We're going to miss you James, thank you so much for what you've done for 8 years really sucks that you have to go but we've enjoyed every single show... Thanks again, lots of Love❤❤❤😢
I hate the fact that Corden has left.  Really going to miss him, but I think that Gordon Ramsey would be a perfect fit for an American late night show!
This show was a way out of darkness. I'm so proud of the moments we have passed together.
Love you, James! I wish you well in all your future endeavors❤❤❤
I can't believe it's been 8 years!  Carpool karaoke was one of the greatest parts. I watch Elf every Christmas too! 😅
worlds gonna be a sadder place without this show
I will miss the show, m in zambia,  I m not américain but the show  still resonated with me. It made laugh even on days when I was frowning or crying.  This was such a dope show.   All the best, James   @10:00 a goodbye keynote from someone that has relied on the show for the news😅  @12:25 😅🤣🤣🤣 that late night host bit had me flooring
Well done Smithy ❤ who’d have funk it 😊
I've never watched the show.  Is it good?
I'm gonna miss James and the voice of God 😂   ❤ from the EU
Such a great close to a fantastic show! Thank you James Corden! You are amazing and we are gonna miss you!!
The woman that fainted at 17:50
I love Harry and James’ banter
I'm definitely crying in a cool way now
James will be back 😊
And why is everything about this show so fake
An amazing run on Late Night tv !!! All the best James 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Man you made a man cry to today ! This was a really good good bve....hope that your future will be good in the future but help others in need too.
Stephen Colbert said the truest words ever: you’re embarrassing your country.
I come from Uganda, but this show had a positive impact on my life. James, we gonna miss you😢
12:30 The Endgame of Late night tv show hosts, loved it
Going to miss you James you are a great host. God bless you in all your future plans❤
Best to you James Corden.  You will be missed in America!
Each and every time I needed a pick me up or wanted to binge on laughter bc of hard days and nights of work…I always watched James Corden…I felt his emotion in his song especially as he was singing it towards the end. I cried like a baby and to see all those ppl in the audience hugging and getting emotional as well…goes to show how much this man has impacted on ppls hearts. You will and your show and staff will be missed. 👑☁️🙏🏾🤍
Please this is a prank.  Please this is a prank.  Please this is a prank.
I'm going to miss this show so freakin much...!!! Thank you James ..!!
Dont cry, dont cry, OH DAMN IT. Take care of yourself and your family.
James I am an emotional Wreck 😢 What A Guy you are ❤❤ So far your achievements are a fantastic legacy and you've got years yet! Well-done my favourite was always Carpool Karaoke especially Michelle Obama and Barbara Streisand Lots of love mate ❤❤🎉🎉
❤
Guy is a total jerk and glad to see him fail. The fact people watched his show for him to continue to perpetrate his garbage is a sign of the times.
The speech in the end is so inspiring. Good job Corden!
What an amazing miracle. You and your team are just a miracle.
most useless president
When Will started singing as it was 😊❤❤
It's good of the producers to 'let him go' gracefully... When they would prob prefer to just launch him off out of a canon!... Sorry James but you got caught out... Hopefully you can work on your temperament/ego etc in future... But you prob won't.... Ho hum.
Cheers to you late late show.   I gotta say I was a little disappointed there wasn't a last killer news jingle.
I always wanted to visit your Show it was one of my biggest life goals. I grew up with the Late Late show and i learned english through it. You and your team always inspired me with your pure joy, creatifity and love for each other. I‘m sad my dream couldn‘t come true but I‘m so thankful for those 8 years and wish all of you only the best! Greetings from Germany
I never knew James leaving would make me cry like this😭😭 stopping cutting onions🥹
Looser
I am literally crying now in the middle of my dark room 😢😢😢
Man of a thousand talents 🙌
Thank god its over.
Legacy
😢 nooo we will miss you
Thank you James and team for brightening my days for the last few years! So much talent! Wishing you all future success in everything you all do!❤❤❤
Cheers,  mate! You will be favorably remembered and dearly missed.
James walking around, touching staff he has until this moment, has likely never acknowledged.
So glad to see James Cordon leave. He’s so NOT FUNNY. I’ll never understand how he got so popular or successful. I saw him in a play in London years ago & he was a ham actor then & hasn’t improved at all since then. His acting performances are devoid of any genuine emotion & I’m astounded that Meryl Streep has chosen to work with him on more than one project. He certainly didn’t deserve the role of the Baker when there are far more accomplished singers & actors out there. Good riddance to a rude diva.
James is a terrible actor..
Thanks❤
I'm old enough that the thing I enjoyed the most was the Letterman cameo :D
The reaction of the girl to Harry’s fist lol 17:52
James…The heart that you have …One Heart is all we need…Light,Joy….We love you..The universe will miss you like crazzy
I’m so grateful for this show. It has got me through so much. I started following the show when my grandmother died which really hurt my family. We were struggling with her funeral and all the payment. But I kept watching this with my family that lightened the mood. James, we are so sad you are leaving America and we hope you visit again, but I send you prayers and safe travels back to London. I just want to say thank you because this show saved me.
We will miss you and all your talents James 😢😢❤❤❤❤
He’s been a funny guy, sad to see him go. Although it sounds like he was a total dick. But Who knows
so glad this helmet isnt in the uk anymore
That Harry is one weird character.
All the past years you made me laugh so hard, today you made me cry so hard.. feeling empty when mine youtube doesnt show your notification pop up in future but wishes you happy and all the best..
Thank you James for all the laughs you given us. We will miss you. Good luck on whatever you do next. The UK is very lucky 🥰🥰
You'll always be my favourite ❤love from nagaland North East India ❤
Waaau you was amazing . Thnx for the shows and hope see more ik London! 🥰.
What a class act!  James we will miss you, hopefully we'll see you soon on a better venture from England!😊😊😢😢😂❤❤
James came as a nobody. In fact, he is very talented. He is the only talk show host can sing, dance and act. 8 years later, he becomes an American household name. You are the reason why I watch late night show again. The last time I watched late night show was Jay Leno.
harry looks tired he really needs a break
I’m crying. The USA will never be the same!
You were always my first choice at night on YouTube… you actually made Covid bearable… I think everyone on your staff were so blessed to have such an incredible ensemble. Love to all… Godspeed James , to you and your family.💕🇨🇦💕🇨🇦😊😊
Omg since 6th grade and I’m in college now! Omg!
Thanks for the laughs! Good luck on your future endeavors. You'll be missed. 😥💘
Why is he stopping? Thought his show was doing well 🤨
This man is seriously very talented.
Give him a few years and he'll be back
I just can say, thanks for all
I Loved  this show. quite sad. who's going to do carpool karaoke now.
How many retakes you think they took for Biden 😂
Thank you, James, and your production team, for bringing joy to our lives. You’ll be missed!
Brilliant and we only see snippets over here unless you have satellite. Glad he touched the hearts of millions   Welcome home James….now get Gavin and Stacey wrapped up
😢...I will miss this show very much! 🥺 A very classy ( as always) ending. Thank you James for helping me through my depression and anxiety episodes. ✨💜🙏
Congratulation to you, for that part of my life the last 8 years. Sending you best wishes from Austria, with tears in my eyes. Thank you for so many great, funny, nice, lovely... moments. Unforgettable legend! ❤
Good. One less crappy show.
My love! U will be missed 😢
Goodbye!
A bunch of sad low people in this comment section

Farewell late late show😢
Mr. James Corden and crew...THANKS for the MEMORIES...all the best to you and yours!!!!!
thank you so much for bringing joy in our lives, thanks james for everything.
❤❤❤
Great speech
A special performer. I'll miss the mini-musicals.  Best wishes. Your home is England, and that makes sense.
What is he going to do now ?
An emotional final episode. I am going to miss watching James late late at night 😢, but thank you 👏
What a wonderful final episode!!
Love from Nepal
And the speech says it all who could blame you for wanting to go home bless and thank you
Ellen ended after the rumors of her show being toxic and now this is ending after rumors of James being hostile. I wonder if there is any truth to the rumor and if that really is the reason for the show ending.
You are loved James, and ong can't believe I'm watching this rn. This man rlly knows and loves his job and u can tell it. gonna miss him fr and thank you for everything! 🤍
thank you so much for uploading the entire episode!!
I’m glad his shows ending. I never understood why people enjoyed him or his show. In my opinion he’s bland not funny and quite frankly I don’t know why he was popular.
I love Harry Styles outfit on this evening so much! Yellow is just so hot on him! And can we talk how sweet Harry tonight was?! He is so cute and the friendship between James and Harry is insane! I love that young man so so much! But why is he not wearing his rings and nailpolish? ❤️
You are just amazing we will miss you 🥺,why don't you start singing in the future.
Love from 🇳🇬
Thank you so much entire crews for wonderful times.
Hola James, Muchas gracias por tan agradables momentos y originales entrevistas. Deseo fervientemente volver a disfrutar de tu fantástico talento en tu próximo proyecto. Un fuerte abrazo desde la ciudad de México.  Arturo Bustos C.
love you James Corden :) amazing host and a wonderful human being :)
I'll miss you so much James, I have always loved watching your videos. They just enlighten me! If the show goes on it'll never be as awesome as you were. Good luck on your new adventures.
We will miss you pal❤
So long jumbo tron, hardly anyone will miss you.
Too bad your show is ending. I kinda liked it.
James you really made me laugh for the past 8 years and I fell in love with musical because of you.
Will Farell looks like America's next president
A great show! You will be greatly missed! Thanks for all the laughs and incredible talent! Enjoy your life to the fullest!🥲ALOOOOOOOOOOHA!!!
I’m crying I can’t help it I wish I could go to 10 year back mannnnnnnnn 😭😭😭😭😭 I’m gonna miss this whole thing sm I hate how things change so fast 🤧
Oh no! They're closing! Do something, James!
James cordon we will miss this incredible show for ever but im very sure you will excel in new endeavour with marvellous things to come. Rock on and god bless you
I gave it a try, but it's not for me.  Glad you all enjoy 😉
James, you're the best presenter and I aspire to be just like you!!
0:37 What now?
17:52 same bestie
I'm so glad Harry Styles was there!!!
Him acting as if Biden is god and not a f*cking idiot is beyond me. He's the worst president. Best part of this show is obviously Harry ❤
I loved this show!! It’s was such a great tribute and honor that all the late night hosts . Got together for a great send off!! Loved seeing David Letterman!! Bravo James!👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Reggie’s voice when Harry and Will came out was everything!
We will miss you James Corden <3
i tried not to cry when watching this, between him and jimmy Fallon, he was my favorite to watch ❤❤❤ all the laughs from Jonas brothers, to Kevin hart, to carpool from Nicki Minaj, Adele to skits with the kardashians they were my favorites, watching this especially when Covid was going around made my system and nights better. You will be missed James cordon thanks for all the laughs, the cries, and warmth you brought from not only your family, friends, workers and guests. We are not just guests, not just family, we are an EMPIRE, and I couldn’t say any better! Love you and good luck and enjoy the rest of the memories and blessings back in England💗💗💗 Love you!!!
REST IN PISS
We all have flaws. 😊🙏🏾
Jump to 18:28. You are welcome.
Going to miss his humor and genuine self
I’ll miss you Mr. James Kimberly Corden❤thanks you for all the cheer you brought to me online in Ghana 🇬🇭 you delivered a great show😊kudos 🎉
Great Show!!! You’re amazing! 🤩🤩🤩
33:50-35:00 Thank you James for saying this. It is so important. We will miss you so very much!!

James corden one of the best tv host on earth 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢saying goodbye is bitter but i hope we see him on tv again one day

Why always so fake? Learn to be genuine like Katy Perry please 😅
Thank God no body ever wanted you here James
Thank you for all laugh you are awesome we will miss you 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
I <3 James! all the best
23:30
God Bless America, God Bless James Corden, and god damn that silly outfit harry styles is wearing, who in their right mind would wear something so ridiculous to a farewell show? It's almost disrespectful if you ask me... He must be on some strong Hollywood meds!
James .. I will miss you and your amazing beautiful show!! Your crew members and the band were brilliant and fantastic!! I’m gonna miss this forever 🥺.. you made my days filled with laughter and joy! Thank you 😊!!! Loveeee you ♥️♥️
I've watched this show so many nights, for so many years, through so many phases. From watching it on  hangout nights with my friends, to having it play in the background just because "good vibes", to watching it on my lowest of low days, as well as my most bright days.  to watching it with all my brothers. Now as I'm growing up and moved away from the family, taking on a new adventure, this show has been my comfort, the nostalgic memories of watching it with the family and friends, to the funny content that would help me fall asleep on a positive note after such a rough day at work. this show and it's crew has such a special place and will always be a comfort show for me. Thank you James for helping me create such great memories  with my friends and family, thank you James and the crew for always dilivering great content that still has that touch of classic of late late shows, thank you James for being you, you're energy is what brings that something speacial. watching this I started to actually tear up, I didn't realize all these years how this show has been such a big part of our lives. Good luck on your future adventures!!!
😭 will be missed ❤
We will miss the show james lots of love 💞
Nearly half of the USA is evil.  They're rooting for Putin, and put deadly targets on the backs of all liberals especially of color.  It isn't about a different opinion or view.  Fascism in any form is inherently evil.  If I had another country to run to, I'd be there by now.  Smart choice for the safety of your family, James.  It's not getting better here - the division was solidified when they waged war against the USA on 01/06/22.  And since - the fascist have gotten worse and still allowed to voice their hate, even though their stunt on 01/06 was no different than the stunt pulled 09/11.  I will never normalize terrorist even if the USA chooses to do so.
I seriously cannot stand the man.Couldnt watch Gavin and Stacy because he really got on my nerves with his stupid over the top laugh!
After the Biden clip James says “That’s amazing.” That’s amazing alright - amazing Biden could string two sentences together. What a buffoon 🙄
Will miss this show loved the carpool Karaoke and the spill your guts :) <3 <3 James, thank you for all the entertainment and laughs you brought us
Nos extrañaras pero nos volverás a ver porque este.....es tu show....como one Direction nos estarán los extrañamos y nos volveremos a ver 🎉🎉🎉🎉❤ los amo late late show (y one Direction jsjsjs)
no nod to Craig........love what you made of the show......good luck with what comes
Aside from all the tears and the great last show, i can't help but think this is related to the chef who called him out.
all my 20s, thank you <3
Will definitely miss his show ,  his show was entertainment at  its’s finest  , he may not have been the greatest host ever but he was a top entertainer on his show , and for me it was a treat to watch his show for 8 and a half years , James , his staff , & his band were all phenomenal , and I hope he comes back to tv in some  form or the other or even gets a chance to  do a talk show in London , i could not hold the tears back when he performed with Tom Cruise and sang “Can You Feel The Love  Tonight” James James James 👏
THANK YOU JAMES
Good luck pal. All the best. You've brought some joy.
I miss you 😭😭💖
I loved the Late Late Show and I love James! Hopefully this wasn´t the last time we saw him hosting a Show!
i love watching this show so much that i will surely miss every single sigment..carpool karaoke,crosswalk.the musical and others too! !!not having to watch it anymore makes me sad..but then,good luck james and each and every one of you  .God bless you all..and thank you  for such a wonderful ,fun,laughters and loving show for 8 years
this is such a bittersweet end
I literally was crying after watching this final episode. When he started the show in 2015 I was only a young kid and he used to make me laugh when I was anxious or sad. I hope he succeeds in whatever else he is planning to do ❤️
17:49 is cracking me tf up cause girl same
You're a block buster ending funny shows, James ... So long, farewell, I hate to see you go ... But Carpool Karaoke, Adeu! 😢😘💚💚💚💚
I'm not crying,  you are👀
the voice in the beginig sound like liam payn
Your show is so special James!  Thanks for happy, funny, sad moment that you shared with us. :")
I will incredibly miss watching this show 😢
I can't believe it ended
I’ve watched and refused to watch so many late nights hosts.  James has been the best by far.  Kind.  Funny. Kind. Talented.  Kind.  Cathartic.  Kind.
Seth Meyers 🙌
A great show, Thank You James Corden and all the team for this amazing Show. James you are fabulous.
Everyone kind of laughs and rolls their eyes at my obsession with James Corden but I started watching him when I was in my deepest depressive episodes and he was such a light in that dark time and every dark time since. Thank you CBC for posting the full episode!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
this is so sweet omg when he started talking to the crew and the band and writers i broke down fr
Home girl fainted with that fist bump from Harry Styles 😂❤
NO IM GONNA CRY HOW IS THERE NO MORE LATE LATE SHOW
lots of shouting in this show
thanks, thanks James and crew always!!!
is no one gonna talk about the woman who passed out after she saw Harry haha
I can’t believe this going to miss him he is amazing
love your show love the car singing with different artist
I truly love the message James ended with ❤ he will be missed
This show got me through the pandemic. Kept my spirits high through all the darkness 🙏🏾
I still can't believe it! I already miss the show too much!
Best show ever ❤❤❤
Mean little guy😁
this show has been my safest place for years and i can't believe that days where i wont wake up feeling excited to watch the new carpool karaoke or spill your guts . but what a run it was . thankyou for everything james we will miss you 🥰
most liked episode yet
I know he has a bad reputation. But I will miss him and the energy of this show. All the best
What an amazing artist and human being! Thanks for all the joy!
LOVE YOU JAMES. YOU ARE MY FAVORITE TALK SHOW HOST. THANK YOU FOR ENTERTAINING US ALL..AND MAKING US LAUGH😂 AND COMING INTO OUR HEARTS.❤😊  I HOPE YOU AND TOM CRUISE CAN STILL GET TOGETHER. YOU GUYS ARE SO FUNNY.😂❤  I WISH YOU ALL THE BEST.  🥰💖😘
💔
I've haven't and never will see an episode of the late late show but god am I happy James Cordon is leaving
Good, sad for those losing their job, but glad this duck is done.
♥♥♥
I’m not crying you’re crying!!
thank you James for being such a positive outlet for people. gonna miss seeing this show so much, but I can’t wait to see what you do next congrats and good luck 🤍.
Thanks for everything and wishing you all the best!
😭😭😭❤💖
whats the music/song they used for the introduction?
I think it says something when we can all name the staff and writers on the show. He left in a way that defines class and decorum. The show brought great joy and it meant so much so many.
An absolutely painful and fake series of ramblings to mark an end of a presenters run who was way too big for his boots, from the get go. James is a known nightmare to work with and most likely still thinks he'll be remembered as one of the best modern actors ever, absolutely ridiculous and especially when you consider the roles he's taken off other people as with Into the Woods.
Thank you James Corden! The musical numbers were such a delight for me! You pleasantly surprised me with your vocal ability. Thank you for singing! Thank you for the comic relief! To Your Health!
Thank you so much for all the lights , I love you James and everyone behind the scene. Loads of love all the way from sunny Dubai to you all ❤️❤️❤️❤️
what a journey! congratulations on a new beginning, James! thank you so much for making me laugh like a crazy girl. i will miss seeing you as a late late host and your wonderfully weird and funny segments, but with a creative mind like that, i know i will not have to wait for too long. see you soon, james!!! ps harry, gorgeous and talented and sweet as always muaaaahhhh
Thanku for Helping me through my rough teenage-years. Ily❤️
Everyone knows what his really like - they are all fake acting prenteding they like him
You're not dying, just moving on to bright, new things and I'm sure keeping in touch with all these friends! Looking forward to what you do next--full blown market square musicals? Good luck.
Thank you for all the memories James!
Every time James say “Last time” I well up with tears. This show brought me so much happiness. 😢❤
Ok bye, I want Craig or Conan.
i really thought harry would replace u as the host as a joke but im just happy he's on the show truthfully
Good, cya don’t let the door hit you on the way out
Damn it James I'm sobbing like a baby! I've loved  watching as much of the show as I could from here in New Zealand, it has been a wonderful journey and taken me through almost my entire 30s. Congrats on a wonderful achievement and enjoy your journey home to new adventures! xo
The girl that fainted after Harry gave her a fist bump was so real for that
Thank you James!
Welcome home :)
Thank your for the incredible memories James , you were always my favourite and you will be missed
I’m currently crying please come back for another season 😢❤
We love you all over the world!
Awww Harry’s words to James that made me almost tear up and I know one direction will come back one day I still have faith so I’m happy with Harry’s response 🥺💙 I love you James Corden I’m gonna miss you, I’ve watch you throughout the years you’re def my favorite host aside from Jimmy Fallon I will miss spill your guts too I loved seeing those episodes 🥹❤❤❤ god bless your kind soul at the end I couldn’t help but tear up when I seen you tear up too almost cry 🥺🥺😭 wow amazing last late late show
As an Englishman let me just this guy is very unfunny.
Love you James 🇧🇷❤
❤️
Jesus is the only way ✨🙌🏻✨
Welcome to the final show! ❤️
Good riddance
Such a great show! This last show was Amazing! Good luck on your future projects James and greetings from mexico
LOL the girl that fell back after fist bumping Harry is me
This is so sad. I will miss the show so much.❤ it made me laugh. When I was sad, it  made me laugh and James Corden thank you.
1:57 "I can't believe this" had the same energy as "I can't believe you've done this"
Damn! Colbert can really be scary and Trevor NOAH IS THE WEEKEND'S TWIN...
Well done

Only here for Will, idgaf about this stupid show and cringe guests.
cried
It was such an emotional end.
Admiro a las personas que saben "retirarse a tiempo", priorizando sus sentimientos por su país pero fundamentalmente, por su familia. James, eres muy divertido, tremendo actor y amé los carpool karaoke especialmente con ADELE! GRACIAS POR LO QUE NOS HAS DEJADO! ❤ BUENA VIDA! ❤
I bet James is a very good friend
Good he sucks,
Aww I’m so sad there wasn’t one last news jingle
I started watching as soon I found out that James was doing a show and kept watching every single episode and I just became so proud of him and I'm so thankful for him, I will miss him but I understand he has to take care of his family, I'm never gonna forget for what he did for people and the show and how much happiness it brought all the smiles and laughs.
Go well James enjoy your new life where ever it may take you .  I’am sure this is not the ending but only the start of something much bigger too come in your life thank you for your entertainment go well good sir 🫡.. from the beautiful people of the late late world you will be missed but we will surely see you again because it’s never over till it is your last days enjoy Mate .. 😊
Oh this travesty is finally over.
sorry to say it, but this makes me miss Craig Ferguson
I’ve watched your final show twice now James……cried both times. I really will miss you but I truly understand your reasons for leaving and kudos to you for making that choice. Thanks so much to you and the entire staff for always making me laugh. You are truly a family and that came across so well on the show.  Well done!  👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻  Best wishes to all of you! I know your light will shine brightly in whatever you choose to do in the future. Love to all and God bless! ♥️
17:51 me when I meet Harry Styles
How did Will and Harry both age by 30 years within the course of 5-10 years?
thank you James ❤
James,thank you !!for all the laughs 😊🎉🎉🎉❤
im not crying you are crying
I would only watch some of the carpool karaoke clips occasionally, but that was it, so I won't miss the show not being on any more. All that being said, I wish the kid Corden nothing but success for the rest of his career
😭😭😭no 1d renunion
tears, tears. =)
IM GONNA CRYYYY
cant believe it... im gonna miss it
Hope Craig Ferguson will come back
“We are all more the same then we are different”
I never found this show funny and i dont even know why it was in my recommendations
1st time watching the show, you're a funny guy🤣 Is this really your last show?
This show is incredible! We love you James, good luck💞
That was an awesome run, James. Thank you.
As someone who is only able to watch the clips that have been uploaded one YouTube I wanted to thank you for uploading the full final episode! The final week was certainly special and I'll truly miss this incredible late night show! James, you'll be greatly missed but I wish you all the very best and can't wait to see what's up next. Lots of love from Austria  ❤
This is so sad😢
bro dont go please
Love your show. Enjoy your time with your family ❤❤❤
I can’t stand these talk show hosts. Especially jimmy K and Stephan the pedos. Disgusting humans. Bought and paid for by the elite to spin whatever narrative they want them too. Never forget the hate speech that came out of jimmy K’s mouth toward the unvaxxed. That didn’t age well did it.
Made me cry. We will miss you here.
You created magic and we are truly grateful 🖤
James, hope you loose all those Hollywoodinised shenanigans when you're back home.
When Harry kissed James' dad's head <3
James Corden should audition and get the role of John Wicks Adopted Son. James runs around major cities jamming pencils down into people eye sockets who were responsible for shooting up his dad. Finally he kills them all and stands over John Wicks grave, reciting the poem, from Dylan Thomas;  "Do not go gentle into that good night" then John Wicks force ghost appear standing next to James with one arm around his shoulder.
This was my favourite of the late shows but I stopped watching all of them due to  the politics and division.Good luck James and crew on the future endeavors.
Ratings plummeted show terminated.
10:56
Anyone else see the girl fall over after Harry fist bumped her at 17:51
Thank you James and crew for being a constant glimmer of joy and laughter for the last 8 years and majority of my 20s.   Thank you all the best🤙🏼🖤
Gonn' miss you man
"You know, God did speak to me and he told me I don't need to be in this bit." im rolling
😢
Thank you James. We love you From Finland❤
❤️
Don't let the door hit you on the way out.
Hurry looks weird, this whole thing looks fake.
Your all awesome thank you for all the laughter.
why did they stop the show？
James ended the era like a rockstar, but with a class of style. I have watched ur shows during there years from here and there, but I binge watched for 2 days straight for the funniest episodes and bit of this! thank you <3
James, good luck, my man.  Thanks for your positive-fun energy over the years
❤❤❤
Thanks for all your late late night entertainment Mr. Corden. You will be missed on the late night band. I can officially say "James Corden has left the building." Godspeed.
Crying😢 This show will surely be missed. ❤
But now, who does continue Carpool Karaoke?
Thanks you james! Thanks for all the laughter and joy you brought to us! Looking forward to see the next big thing you'll do🌟🙌🏼🧡
how come they are finishing the show??
You can't leave without reuniting One Direction.
Lot's of great memories 😅
first four minutes wasted
Thanks for leaving James your talentless anyways.. Done well for a fat boy tho
This has to be the best finale of any show on TV.  Well done.😢😢😊
I want to give a shout out to an underrated but absolute gem of a skit- Take a Break. It was brilliant and I've honestly had the biggest laughs of my entire life watching those 😂 Thank you James & beloved crew SO much for all the joy. You are all beautiful and talented people who I know will continue to do great things. But let's take a moment to rightfully be very proud of what you did here the past 8 years ❤ Cheers everyone!!
I loved you more than anything James ❤ #forever
You need your own YT Channel James consider that !
Thank you for the great show! Been loving this since I was in University. Thank you again!
I dont think you would ever be able imagine how much your shows lightened up our lives and it still does. Thanks for all, you are special & talented and will be missed✨💚
So sad to see this show end! I have had the most amazing laughs and entertainment ever watching it. What a wonderful farewell tribute and song…brought tears to my eyes. Wishing you nothing but the best James!
good rIDDANCE
Never have I written anything while the show got into the YouTube but this is the last time the final time and it is the beast of very belonging of our daily life  Every time every moment in my saddest to my most happy ones this show was the one of the greatest moments of joy and entertainment   1. From Carpool Karaoke to Spill your Guts or Fill your Guts   2. From Comedy skits to Doctors of invention   3. From Bits of Hilarious Audience Q&A to News    Late Late Show has been the greatest game changer and entertainment giver of Last Eight Years   Let’s see who’s next as the host   Till then we know and we know for sure we miss you James    ❤❤❤ Love you James Corden
That was, without question, THE classiest ending they could have ever given this show. Bravo.
😢😢💔 I love you and your whole crew💔
I can’t believe it ended
His leave hits different when you know how he is really irl 😂
I was sure that nobody could fill Craig Ferguson's shoes. And James didn’t. But I'm glad that he got the big budgets and CBS actually promoted this iteration of The Late Late Show.   Cheers.
Everyone forgot that hes a mean human being that treats his staff and everyday people like crap? Bye James Corden
thank you so much james, we’ll always love you💗💗💘💞💖
As an Indian guy..I never thought an American talk show could have such an impact on me..that too hosted by a man from London. James does not deserve the hate he is receiving..this show has been a safe spot for me..whenever I am down, I used to turn on this show..one hell of a journey..Good luck James..and Thank you
I watched  from India and all his shows brought so much laughter n joy .Thanks for just being James Corden❤
💘💘💘
still amazes me how americans whoop so much without moving their mouths.
I can’t stress enough how insane and hilarious the “hobama” edits with Harry styles and President Obama are that are all over TikTok . I close that app, open YouTube, and here’s Harry again and it’s all I see now. 😂😂
good fucking riddance jesus
😢 I’m gonna miss you, I’m gonna miss carpool karaoke…. I hope you all the happiness and joy, you bring to me. You’re the best o one
I am happy for him but now what do we do hahaha. This is depressing!
You are my favourite and will be missed terrible ❤
Good work out for him
❤
❤ Dear James, i won‘t forget how you brought us through the pandemic! God bless you💕💕☺️
This isn't even sad lol, Johnny Carson hosted the tonight show for 30 years the GOAT, 😂
Why is the show ending
Why do they need to end the show ?
Watching this show has brought me so much joy and im sad its over but i hope james and his family will enjoy every moment they have together ❤

So sad that this came to the end i grow up watching late late show it made me laugh when i was stressed it also made learning English more fun, so it is therapy for me and still will i will still come and wach back  Support james decision ❤❤
That final song was really heartwarming 😊
The only thing stoping this show from being perfect was Taylor swift not having a carpool karaoke. Anyways, thank you James. You’ll forever remain my favorite host. Amazing job

Great show! It's been an amazing run. You had a stand out show and will be missed.

the fact this episode starts with the national anthem makes it a W already
He is a big doushe, anyone who knows him say he is entitled nob head... Most productions other then this show was disaster... 😅 I wish I didn't learn what I did about him, and live in happy blisfull ignorance. 😅
I love this show and this man so sad its over but them memories are for ever
Thank you, James, for brightening my days. I’ve shared so many things with my family. My favorite being the crosswalk musicals. Good luck to you, and please come back soon. Best wishes to you and your family ❤

https://youtu.be/yJFVvmJGfh0
I LOVE THAT
That was legendary, thank you 💞 Жаль, у Вечернего Урганта не было шансов на такое
Naw…going to miss this!!!
Harry is becoming more gay by the day
Can not wait to see what he does next! So much talent in one gentleman!
Thank you for 8 years of laughters , kudos for James and the Entire Crew !!! ❤
I loved ending of this show more than Ellen's but I loved Ellen's show in general too, just felt more emotions here
I love that they uses radiohead's the national anthem
Thanks for all the memories and entertainment, you're show will be missed. At least we have YouTube to re-watch it! Love from India 💕
Just take it to where ever u r going!!! 😢
Way last ?
James got a lot slack for being a dick at that restaurant, but people are allowed to have a bad day. I genuinely feel that he gave his 100% with this show, but it’s time to bow out. I will miss this show and the entire staff so much. No more Late Late Tinder 😭
It's been fun, emotional all the memories I have of this show with one direction solo and not, all the funny videos, the carpool karaoke, the spill your guts, when Harry hosted it, everything I will never forget it, thank you for this amazing show it's been amazing to have Harry at the last episode. You'll always be the best host of the late late show, big love to all of you ❤
Psychopaths are presented as new standards. GOOD BYE Western Civilization
We all gonna miss you James all over the world 💔💔 love you 💝
This made me cry first thing in the morning
Im crying😢😢😢
ugh any jenner garbashan, non celebrities at all.   James will be missed.
Good riddance. He has some anger issues he needs to work on
And the Zionist PROPAGANDA against the White Race CONTINUES...
Him, Ellen got caught and their world is crumbling down. Got the easy way out.
thank god hes done hes so annoying
As emotive as Tucker's last show.
Boy bye
Why? Another plan by you own?

Voy a llorar con los comentarios
Oh F I heard he’s back in the UK now! US can keep him
🔥 🔥 🔥
Ending for a reason, the dude sucked.
The national nightmare is over.
He will be missed 😭 But happy for him! 😇
Greetings from Argentina
Why is Harry wearing a women's bell-bottom leisure suit from 1973?
This is the worst thing I’ve ever seen. I hope he doesn’t come back to the UK as I can say with great confidence that we do not want him back 😂
Took long enough
Well done Smithy now can you come finish painting my living room pal 😂
James more to come,                                       new beginnings,                   for the LOVE of it,                     you make this life time better,     Roger &Paul.
😭
I'll miss the notification😢
I see harry, I CLICK
Thank you Mr. Corden. It was fun watching your show :o)
What is enjoyable about your show, it's always positive and fun! A nice break to the rhetoric of today's society!
James - you are a legend!! ❤We miss you already 😢 But I know you’ll find a new way to spread joy and laughter to the world! 💕 xxx
This show made my life so much better during corona, and before and after it as well. As an international viewer, in the evening after uni or work, my day became so much brighter because of it. The amount of creativity and thoughtfulness that was put into each show was outstanding. Thank you to every person who worked on it, I hope you all read these comments because this show was love in all its forms and you deserve to keep getting recognized for it! THANK YOU!
the nightmare is over
You will be missed significantly! :( Thanks for ALL the laughs you have brought to our lives!! 🥺🙏🏽🥺🥺🥺🥺❤
あいしてるーー
❤
Ill miss this so much!!😭
THANKS FOR JAMES'S INCREDIBLE AND MAGNIFICENT SHOWS FOR US SINCE 8 YEARS AGO UNTIL NOW, ALL OF US ARE VERY APPRECIATE FOR THESE@@~.WE LOVE YOU JAMES@@.THANKS FOR YOUR HARDWORK!!!!!!!
Oh that last song😭😭😭 it was perfection❤❤❤❤❤ but please don't go😢
Thank You James! ❤🥺
❤😢 dziękuję James za wspaniałe przedstawienia❤
Enjoy a mutch earned rest my friend.. thanks for all the laughs and a few tears..you are a true Allround entertainer and a master of the lost art of self deprecating humor..take the week off and start back at work on the next season of " gavin and Stacey"!!.😂😂♥️🇬🇧
I absolutely love how he ended the show with Harry as one of the final guests. The man's hosted the show himself a few times, I'll surely miss James' humor but all things have to end eventually. Use me as an "I was here before the end," button <3
I did my first dislike BC I can`t believe that Corden retired........I will miss his shows so much where , so often, I laughed tears ....... :( You will be missed! PLS do another one on BBC or any other UK station Mate!
Legend shit only
I LOVE TOU JAMES! thank youuu for everything!!! Thank you to all who made the late late show possible. Thank you for bringing joy all over the world. We love you. Thank you!❤
Its been a great run James and hopefully you are moving on to bigger and better things .Will miss you .Smiles 😃 from Canada 🇨🇦
He gave us the GIFT of 8 years of him! What more could we ask for? Good Luck & Best to you James!!!
Thank you James and all the crew members for bringing an amazing show and unforgettable experience to the entertainment world. What an 8 fabulous years, full of surprises, and out-of-the-box ideas. Thank you James and welcome home.
Plz come back & pickup where you left off when your children are older. Come back & do a show in the summer..
I will forever miss Crosswalk and rewatch them on the youtubes❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹
Miss your show already 😢
I now have respect for James.
James will go down in television history as a failure. Comes to L.A obese and 8 years later leaves L.A  obese. Couldn't lose the weight.
Omg will Farrell is Henry Style’s Father! They look exactly the same!
Great ending,,All the best to everyone
Thank god
Love how all talk show hosts came. Epic!!
("
Just one word THANK U ALL ok they are 3 but....  Really thank u for had put in my life happy memories and distractions of dark moments of my life. And a big thank u to James, even if we didn't know each other in person I always known that u were always there for me. So I hope to see u again in whethever thing u are gonna to do like films, even just a guest on something or in person one day 😅😊 Love u so much and  wonderful things to all❤ Giulia 💕
good riddance
Why have the show ended though??
minhaz Vai gaming😢😢😢😢😢
See ya cordon ! You won’t be missed
Being in Asia, I first knew of this show when a promo video was recommended to me by YouTube , but I have never been able to watch an entire show. Nevertheless, I have enjoyed all the clips uploaded to this channel over the past eight years (Crosswalk Musicals are my perennial favourites).  I truly appreciate the opportunity to watch the last ever show in its entirety! ❤  Kudos to everyone involved for a great run, and best wishes to all of you for your future endeavours...
10:04thumbs down.... you need to pick better guests.
They haven’t done spill your guts in a while (COVID). Who is going to take over that bit?
Thank God
The opening is James being told all the doors to him will be closed in Hollywood after turning down 50 mil.
Love you James ❤
Will and Harry could’ve just turned the knob 😂
Thank you james for everything. I grew up with the show. The time flies by. Such beautiful 8 years. We will miss you so much!
Ridiculous
Not sure why YouTube tried to shove this down our throats.
😁😁
You will be missed!  Always a joy to watch. Best of luck to you, James!
Gonna miss this show and the cast's antics
Crying my eyes out at this
How can you not cry saying goodbye? Love you James. Thank you for your love & your humor always.❤
You knew people will look for that last episode, so you gave us what we wanted. Thank you!
Okay good riddance
It's really sad to see a talk show host so closely aligned with a politcal party that the president of the U.S. takes time to tell him farewell.
Harry give your sister back her clothes, or maybe your bent.
It’s quite apt that everyone was applauding him on his way out. I bet they were all thinking “clear off you spoilt brat and never come back”.
I wish I could thank this show for the laughs and entertainment it’s provided me over the years. Thank you James and the crew!
Another band member we lost😢 But it's okay, we all are proud of u and wishes u very best ❣️
Men qiziqish bilan tomosha qiladigan america shoularidan biri. Ehtimol yagona. Jimmy Fallon dan tashqari. Albatta James bizga bergan quvonch uchun tashakkur. Uning istedodi chegara bilmaydi.
We absolute would forever cherish the happy memories of the show - truly coming from your lovely parents and family, thank you for the humor and happiness in making my mum and I laugh every time, especially when you exceptionally landed on the ground when skydiving with Tom Cruise. Farewell Late Late Show, will miss everyone part of it and I look forward to your continuous work James!
Good journey for James..    best of luck...   .     Good luck for everyone..   and for the ass...les. making poor comments go an find another place ... Better another planet
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
LOVE YOU JAMES!
best ever. reminds me of jay Leno and Conan ending
I will miss this show very very very much. thank you James and the entire crew that contributed to this show. it meant so much to all of us. we had our fair share of laugh every weekend, will miss this. thank you!
Omg! As a latina, I'm still surprised on how these kind of entertainment format can be that impactful, here we dont have such a thing. The late late show has been a vehicle for me to practice my English and getting to know new ways of humor, thanks for it, I could discover more world with you❤
I see a The Shinning remake with Harry Styles playing Jack Torrance. Thats just what i see
I hate goodbyes
Thank you having Harry of your  last guest.
Harry styles needs to start dressing normal. Wear a smart suit son your look alot better.
THE RIGHT WILL RISE AGAIN
Thank you so much James, for show for over 8 years.
Oh James! I will miss your show although I can only watched over YT ( UK here) 😘
Yes continue to show that men wearing dresses is fine, but whenever mental health is such a problem a person shoots up a school because they are not right in the head. Yall blame the gun like its alive collaborating with the shooter.  The number of mentally unstable individuals is huge, so quit normalizing it but promoting these sick individuals. Yes they are mentally sick.
I'm going to miss 😂you. In my depression I laughed cos of this show. THANK YOU
I loved the episodes with BTS and the Filharmonics. Thank you, James Corden!
Am I the only one that fast forwards through monologues on all talk shows?
Always so disappointing to discover the celebrity is a knob head:   I thought Corden was a stand up guy, but turns out he's an incredibly rude and arrogant prick.  Just ask several of his guests and many ordinary people who've encountered him in "real life".  There are plenty of videos here to prove it.  (He reminds me of Ellen DeGeneres.)
Crying? People are starving in the world and wars are going on! People need to change their outlook on life and what’s really important and real!
The glue must be every climate gluers wildest dream.
i was watching this show with my mom who doesn’t really know english. i used to translate some words and phrases to her, but sometimes she didn’t need that. that’s how she learned about all my crushes and always talked to me about it. she watched it because it was interesting even though she couldn’t really understand what they are talking. this is why this show has always been my favourite. thank you for amazing memories❤️
James loves Harry styles so much it's not a surprise that he is his last guest
I can't ignore a show starting with The National Anthem. btw, is that voice, at the beginning, from Christoph Waltz?
thank god he is done, i hate this man so much kekw
one of the best tonight show ever
Rip
Now, Ricky Gervais is happy Cordon is Out for good
harry styles what have you done to yourself
THE NATIONAL ANTHEM?
Bring back Craig Ferguson ! Please 🙏
Now harry don't only  dress like girl but he becomes like a girl and have girly personality now feel bad for her fiance and kids
Take a bow, well done & a huge congratulations. Thank you and see you soon
Yo did anyone else see that the girl who fist bumped Harry fell off the platform afterwards..😞
Who is replacing him?
J'ai adoré regarder The Late Late Show de France ! Bravo et merci James Corden ! Hâte de voir la suite 😍🙌🏼❤
Never really been a fan of James's show , its just not my cup of tea but i recognize that he clearly did bring something new to the late show table , some of it great and some of it not so great and rather cringe but you cant please everyone.  I do however wish him well , the respect I have for him regarding his decision is high, hes choosing family hes being true to his word with his wife who clearly means the world to him and wants to give his children the freedom and space to build their own lives and have their own settled childhoods while reconnecting closer with his immediate family who live thousands of miles away.  Say what you will about his style , his skills or his known behaviour outside the show, we cant imagine the stress being a showrunner creates and how it changes your behaviour 99.9% of us would fall into the same trap but this man loves his family and is putting his own ego aside to make sure hes there for his family.  That tells me deep down this man has a heart of gold even if its not visible at times. As we would say in the UK ..... hes a good egg.
Bru aint no way this show ending what im gonna click on now when I’m randomly scrolling through youtube
OMG does that mean he is coming back to the UK? Please keep him US !!!!
I knew harry would be his last guest
Harry ( Styles?)...
Congratulations to James Cordan on celebrating his final episode on the late late show with James Cordan
Thanks James for a wonderful ride!!  It has been a joy!!
harry going thru all stages of grief when will said england was a sh*t hole 😂❤
Are we going to talk about the girl that fainted after Harry fist bumped her?
He will be missed. What a great person he is.
All I see are a lot of people they're going to collect unemployment for two years and our taxes are going to go up because they don't want to get a normal job that helps real people.
Who cried when the no control video from carpool karaoke with one direction came on the screen 😢
I will miss you James!
O-Ren Ishii’s entrance music, mkay mkay.  🤣the girl fainting at Harry’s fist-bump tho. DED!
The introductoon was hilarious! Always innovative & creative!! I'll miss James a lot. His humor & talent was so refreshing in an often dark world. Xx
Can't wait to see what Reggie does next!!! I remember him from Montana Speech & Drama, can't believe Montana news hasn't covered the "local boy who made it big" angle...well I can, sadly, but I hope Reggie knows that his home state is proud ♥
Anything related to his restaurant behaviors, and overall attitude outside the studio?
Thanks for the laughs & moments we'll Never forget ❤
Good times James! Looking forward to seeing what you do next!! (Got emotional there for a min at there end 😢)
wait wtf james corden show is ending??
Thank god he's out!
Harry became suck a clown
Thank you James and crew for the memories!
Harry was so unprepared and awkward this time and I loved it.
James is definitely a talented guy but, his show was not quite my style.  I was a die-hard Craig Ferguson fan.  I respect his decision to turn down $$$$ to return home and raise his children in the UK.  (If I could, I'd do the same!)  But, I was hit hard by his closing comments.  Those 8 yrs he was here were really harsh ones here in the US!  He could see from the outside looking in how nuts it's become here and he basically told us to stop fighting amongst ourselves and get our shit together!  And he's right!
Finally this is ending
Best wishes on your future endeavors 💌 we will miss you
Good bye.
The song at the end was beautiful and the perfect ending
Final episode? Foken finally🎉
Christ, James. Been a fan of you since the days of 'Fat Friends' and I'm so unbelievably, weirdly, proud of you. Don't let anyone tear you down. You're wonderful and deserve all the success.
I am so grateful to all of you for helping me get through so many difficult years. It’s ridiculous, but you’re a treasured part of my day and it’s hard to say good bye. ❤️Anyway, decisions made for family are the decisions you don’t regret. Big hugs to you all.
Thank you James for everything you’ve done on the show and thank you team to for making this possible.
❤❤❤ Be safe everyone
Where's Conan and Ferguson been?
JAAAAAMES! Brilliant opening brilliant closing babes! Best of luck. You’re the little Turkish delight us Americans didn’t know we needed. I suppose we’ll let you go raise your family now lol. 😘 oh can you at least still do carpool karaoke? 👀 k bye
🙏🏽♥️
Having President Dementia in your show pretty much says it all.
Good Riddance
Don't be a stranger James! We'll miss you
Thank you James Corden and whole entire crew it been wonderful amazing 8 years show. I really miss this show and you James Corden ❤🎉🎉👏👏👏🫶. God bless you 🙏 and your family James Corden
He seems a bit "happy" anyone else agree? Lol
Should have had Conan and Jay come out when they mentioned late night wars in the host bit
IT'S NOT POLITICAL ..........IT'S GOOD VERSES EVIL.....GOD HELP US
All of the hate in these comments makes me sad. Geez guys what happened to TPWK
Not enough Nick Bernstein but great show on the finale.  I'll miss it
Omg I cried and laughed through this whole thing you are an inspiration to ppl and we sure are gonna miss all that you have done to make us laugh. I want to wish you luck on everything that goes on from here.😢😮
Came here because the UK couldn’t stand him. Just an overall douchebag. Now he’s leaving US because USA can stand him. Gotta be a really piece of work.
Good riddance!
Wow 😮people actually watched this poooo
the hate/cancel party that was created towards him over stuff that any humane can grow and learn from them was really fckd up💀🫠  I’m really going to miss this show😭💜
I’m glad this show is trash just like the other late night hosts besides Conan of course
During the open, who was that fellow Brit directing James from the booth?  I've heard him in past segments over the years but, never caught his name.  He was so funny!
Thank you, James and Crew. You've brought joy during some of the darkest times in our Country. Be well. ❤
Thank you James, Reggie, and Ian! You and your team have brought so much joy to all our lives. We are all better for knowing you. <3
Truly you will be missed!! Much love to you and your family going into your next chapter!! Hope we get to share more memories!!! Nice if you do the show across from the pond!!!!❤
I met James Corden one time in London about 9 years ago....we took a selfie. I never imagined he would become so huge. He was huge in my eyes back then. He's a great bloke. I only wish him the best on his next adventure!
In a world that is so full of up and downs , political differences and all the mumble jumbles it is very hard to find some one so pure at heart and #James you all did that. You talk about going back to London with your family but we too are your family here in the US. So here is a crazy and wild thought... Why? Why can't you show us London for those of us who have not Yet gone. Show is the similar things we do or we don't do? Take that idea run with it and take all of your crew with you. Yes the set, yes the crazy but funny band. And now they are still employed. Show us your side of the world which I'm sure is very beautiful. All of us who agree say I (joke/ not joke) ❤#jamedcordon #TAKESUSToLondon sunshine!!! We need more people like you!
Wow the bit with all the other hosts, amazing! I love Colbert going nuts 😂
James Corden started out great, but he went “woke” after a few years (as did many entertainment shows). I stopped watching most late night talk shows once they got on the Trump bashing wagon. Comedy is dead now since you can’t offend anyone without being cancelled. Homer-seck -shoe-alls and trans-people supporters are destroying the country with immoral, deviant behavior and inclusive propaganda. I choose not to watch such perverted garbage.
Bon voyage & we will miss you.😢
So glad now they can get someone that speaks English and has a real since of humor. Just kidding man good luck on your future endeavors.
Aw man, I'm not ready for this. I truly hoped to meet him someday but I couldn't get famous in time :(
Finally, an episode worth watching where we can say goodbye to this assclown
Does this mean he's on his way back to the UK? Say it aint so!
The girl who fell down after Harry gave her a fist bump is so me lmaooo
let's be honest.. no one in America ever watched this show before ..
This  Episode would forever go down in History as one of the best in the world
Finally we're rid of this insufferable man!  Britain can have him back!  The show hasn't been good since Craig Ferguson.
To Late Late, you changed the game, you made us all smile, so so proud of you all and thank you for filling my house with joy night after night. And to James, so happy for you.❤
Thank you for all the memories James going to miss you so much
part 2 https://youtube.com/shorts/KY3Wpd7-En0?feature=share
Couldnt even shake the audiences hands to say goodbye
Goodbye😞 Will miss you!😥Biden said it well for America...🤗☺🌹🌹❤❤🎉🎉🙏🙏🙏👏👏👏👏
James, we get it!  Get rest, come to your senses then you can do something fresh once a month, online “LIVE FROM LONDON”… Never say never.   I can see Fallon doing car pool karaoke hands down.  When I left my small town growing up, for CA, my mum would say “there’s more to life then weather”.  Thank you for the laughs and the light!
I loooved EMOJI NEWS!!! That was how I got interested in the show and always searched for videos on youtube about it…. Should have made one moreeee!!! Be blessed James! Family priority - awesome example for everyone!!
omg... no more carpool karaokes.... T______T
You are super cool and the beginning,  But a douchebag in the end....
Good riddance
See ya
I'm glad he's gone. Terrible host, terrible person and a terrible replacement for Craig Ferguson.
Thank god just came here to say James Corden sucks lol
This wasn't the entire show. Way too much missing to make sense
I’ll be sad when Fallon leaves… that’s about it
So many laughs I’ve laughed because of this show! And because of the person you are James Corden. May God bless you and give you favor and lead you with grace into the next season of your life! This is the best episode of any show I’ve ever seen. We will miss you. And of course we know this won’t be the last time we hear your voice ❤️
I’m crying in a not cool way 😢 Thank you so much James.We love you always. From Japan.
I don’t understand why people hate him. All he ever did was was bring joy and community together. If you want to hate then hate the Dalai Lama because he’s a pedophile  (like all other religions). Did James lick a child’s tongue? No. Did he sing and bring levity to how shit the world is? Yes.
@Elizabeth Bookey,  Thank you for sharing your story of how finding laughter here brought your family some relief. Those of us who can do understand what reaching out to find joy can mean to hurting hearts. The years of covid were full of isolation, fear & grief. I too found respite in late night comedy, the hosts became astoundingly vital to me as they opened their homes & hearts & provided the sanctuary of laughter & kindness to an old crone whose isolation was complete for nearly two years.  May we see the ugliness of spirit for what it is & know it does not either stain nor define ours.   Now I'm hoping i can find a source of laughter so my quota of sustained laughter is met. I've become quite addicted to the endorphins the necessary 20 minutes provides. Blessings, sister friend & to those who posted their support g their stories, hope you continue to share your joy, for that is how it increases.
Ditto to all the other comments. You and your crew are the BEST. Gonna miss you, James. Do something else awesome for us, ya hear? Loving you ~ Mrs. C.
Oh James! I'm so crying right now. I will miss you, your crew your band and every star you've ever had in as a guest. We have seen both your children born not your parents and watched you work your magic with all of them. What you dont realize is how the magic has worked in all of our lives too, your camera audience, all of the hard belly laughs until we all peed our pants laughing. Always, always such a good time and a great laugh ti end our horrible day. Smile my way to bed  every night. Ty so so much. I am devastated but yet happy for you.
Thank God this demon is off the air. What a miserable experience watching that show is.
The David Letterman bit was hilarious… The last good late show host
The end of an era 😪
thank you for sharing the joy...
What is the band going to do now?
I was 17 when this show first aired... My favorite ones are carpool karaoke from Adele, Bruno Mars, Ariana Grande, One Direction, BTS, and BLACKPINK. And also the performances as well. I'm 25, and I still watch those videos to this day :)
All good things come to an end. I'm going to miss you, man! 😭♥️🙌🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾
who?
The only thing that was missing from making this perfect would have been Migos.. R.I.P. Takeoff!!
I'm not crying.. you're crying! 😢
❤..much love and gratitude for so much joy and laughter 🙏
At 17:46 the woman got so excited fist bumping Harry Styles, she fell backwards. 😁
say what u want about him as a person but corden was the ONLY late night host who knew how to utilize the internet to his full advantage
Congrats on the incredible run!
Widely regarded as one of the rudest most insincere belligerent belittling arrogant “humans” in show business. Also, contrasted by the door frame he’s about 5’6”; makes sense
One thing.  Less or no Illuminati hand gestures would be appreciated.  The OK / 666 hand gesture is getting real, real old anywhere it is seen.  It is all over the entertainment industry.
17:48 SAME SISSSS
one of the greatest original writer of humorous talented skits. You have been a blessing to our world.  Thank you James Gorden for non stop entertainment and laughs
I have loved watching your show James Corden and you will be dearly missed bro!! I hope you have a wonderful time back home!
Thanks for the Joy you brought to my life and for being a bright light in this world. Safe travels and blessings on your next adventure
No news jingle?!!!???
As a woman in my 40’s who’s at a crossroads in her life, I’m extremely grateful for that ray of light that The Late Late Show brought into our world. In the shows earlier years I gave birth to both my kids and I would stay up late many nights. I’ve only recently realized that I probably suffered from postpartum depression. I’m so glad you were there to bring that much needed levity to the end of each day. Those were times when I was struggling and not even aware of it. As you stated, the world is in much need of all the joy and light we can reflect upon it. Thank you for all the AMAZING skits, guests, songs, and laughs. You and your crew are absolutely stellar, talented people, and I wish you the best in your next part of your journey. ❤
😢
Thanks for all the fun good times James and Reggie. Y'all Made some awesome late night stoner entertainment. Atleast for me. Good luck on your future endeavors. Much Love.
Thanks James and your team at the late late show you will be missed. I ❤d your show and I will miss it. Thanks again James you'll  be missed.
Nobody could replace him and OMG I LOVE HIS MOM N DAD!!! It just stated and I’m SOBBING!
❤️ ❤❤❤
Thank you, James. For always making us laugh, even when we didn’t feel like it. I can’t wait to see what you do next.
They should have had Conan  come down dresses like an angel 🤣🤣
Thank you James and Crew for making your show a bright spot in my life for eight years! 🥰🎉🥰
The crazy pathetic girls/women took away from the show. Anyway to edit them out so we could watch the actual show?
Brilliant last show governor.  All the best from one fellow Brit to another a job well done 👏🏾👏🏾
We love you James!
Wait.  This guy was successful??
They were handing him his hat.
I've never seen the show, but I will say what he said in his final speech was so true.
I'm so sad to see this show go :,(
this is a great show and ive loved every moment, the bromance is real <3
You made me laugh for years! Tonight, you made me cry. Thank you for sharing your talents. You will be missed!
Aww im going to miss him and the show
what a great suit
Please don’t leave us James! BRING HIM BACK😩😩😩
Thank you James Corden................ for the laughter and a fun hour through the years.
Wow. I'm glad I got to be here for the journey!!
That intro was really dumb
Thank you James ❤ is been a great 8years 😢
Thank you James you’re the best! And your crew, I enjoyed every moment!💞
Anyone see that girl faint after Harry fist bump her 😂😂😂😂
It's been entirely our pleasure to watch.
Good
What a horrible person. Glad he got fired.
I've enjoyed his show immensely. It's origional. There has never been a late show anything like it. Very talented man!!!!!!!
All this because lucy hale wanted my ex boyfriend  pietro bosselli.... she thinks I'm  unworthy
A real mystery why this cringy propaganda died... Thank you for no more of this. Disappear.
To be honest I never really watched his regular showings unless my favorite singer came on his carpool karaoke or got interviewed and I caught it on YouTube
Also I don’t know what it is but Harry Styles seems a lot more introverted now. I’m noticing a pattern with entertainers who get more and more fame they become reclusive.
Thanks to the crew! Sorry you had to put up with that insensitive prima donna twaat James Corden.  I hope you all get better gigs with bigger pay and benefits.
What are with people making Harry Styles into some legend?? The fact he made it on the last show sitting next to Will Farrell .. the audacity for James Corden to elevate him into some King status. This dude is literally a kid and he was in a boy band One Direction. This is literally coming from a 1D fan. He is NOT up there.. yet at least.
I quit watching when ferguson left
Thank God this is the last episode. I hated James Corden
I couldn’t stop crying! 😭
Thanks
What is with all the talk show hosts leaving all of a sudden and having this corny exit. First Ellen, then Trevor Noah.. now James ??
*why the heck am I crying*
oh thank god
As much as I am usually the corny one, something about this seems too corny and over the top..
The door joke was pretty funny.
Why this has to end😩i love James so much! Hope they’ll bring him back! He makes our life so happy😘
I never thought i would cry over a talk show, I’ll miss u James
God speed James!  Thanks for the joy you put into my life! 😘
The Bestest!!! 😢😂🎉❤ We Love You James & Family!!!❤
Will Ferrell was on the Epstein flight log and no one seems to talk about it.
What an absolute legend you are, James!! Your speech was spot on. Thank you for all the smiles, laughs & your amazing voice!!!
This sucks!
Good riddance to this cringe ass show
Stephen Colbert, Seth Meyers and Jimmy Kimmel all on the same stage at once?   Too many Liberal hacks for me.  Excuse me while I throw up.
So meaninglessness!
James, you made something new and beautiful in American late show during 8 years. My family and I came to US from Germany at the same time you came in here. I wish you good luck in your new project and I am sure you will be doing it well. I wanted to do the same as you are doing and going back but I couldn't . Family is important and enjoy your time with your family 🤓🤓
Goodbye The Late Late Show With James Corden. You will be missed ✌️🙏
Oh man he’s funny and a great actor
Thank you for all the great times.
“Such original comedy” will Ferrell thinks about James cordons bits
I’ve never cried more in my life then these past 40 minutes
James, you will probably never see this and that's ok! I just wanted to say Thank you. You didn't know it but you and your show were my bright spot when I didn't have one. You made me laugh and cry all in the same minute! You allowed me for one hour to not think about my illness and the battle I was fighting. You were my one bright spot that allowed me to only think about laughing and watching you sing, dance, drive a car and eat crazy stuff! You got me through to the other side of all my operations and pain! I got one hour of joy and not feeling alone in the battle even though I wasn't. Heres to you James! Thank you for everything you've done without even knowing it! Heres wishing you a life of love and laughter as it truly is the best medicine! Good luck James and you truly will be missed. Until next time! Thanks James!
aw he is the cutest lil guy ever!!
Now if we can get rid of ALL of them.  The “PRESS” and TV Shows cause what taught ALL of US HATE and JUDGMENT. Wish you well and hope that you find peace in your Journey.    One Love Keneth
Hope you know how much happiness you brought to so many during good times & catastrophic times…brilliant band & bits! Will miss you! ❤
Another late show gone but will never be forgotten. Thank you James and everyone who made this show possible, it was truly magical and a delight to enjoy
Such a beautiful soul. And what a team behind him. You will all be missed.
We Love You you mean alot to us God Bless ❤USA😘✌
My love to James & family.💗 You'll be missed. So sorry for the screaming idiots in the audience.
Love you James!! Great Journey, Great Adventure, Great Show!! Amazing Finally! Kudos, Sir!! Can't wait to see what's next!! 💜
james took a chonce on late late show
Thank you James Corden for the greatest 8 years thanks for all the super stars ✨ including ONE DIRECTION I'll miss you good night 🌃 😢😢👋👋👋
So…. This Corden character can go away and be a non late night TV show host who is rude to people now?
Good riddance you dork.
We, your friends and fans, will miss you tremendously!!!  Best wishes to you and your family for all your future endeavors❣️❣️❣️😁🤙
I will miss you James! Used to watch you every morning! Good luck to you and keep spreading the Cheer! ❤
It been a pleasure to watch your journey into late late TV. James Corden and crew it's been a blast. Carpool Karaoke will be a long lasting vibe. Thank you sharing your vision. Best wishes.
Apropacuntthatone
Dude wasn't even funny at all. Conan was the best.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
You weren't Conan, or Fallon, or Kimmel (and Kimmel SUCKS), but shit...you were...the 4th or 5th best option. And that means something.
◾The Late Late Show with James Corden (March 23, 2015 – April 27, 2023)   It's been a great ride and awesome talk show. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!! 💗💚🖤💙🤍❤💛🧡💗
Thank you while you were here! Enjoy home!
Goodluck  in all your travels, God bless you
22:26 Is that Bruno Mars framed in a picture with James cordon behind him? Lol
Sad to see you all go, have loved the show and you guys, it's been great fun thanks!
Your so full of ….
Thank you for all the fun times and for bringing us music and laughs over the last 8 years.  Cannot wait to see what you do in the future.  Wishing you and your family every happiness.   ❤
Exiting with the same amount of grace as Ellen 🤔😬😬😬😬
his speech at the end before the song is something we should all listen to (especially Americans)
❤❤❤
Thank fucking god 😂
Can we have Craig Ferguson back if James is leaving???
THE LATE ⏰ LATE ⏰ SHOW WITH JAMES CORDEN ON CBS 2015-2023: THE END 35:21  THE LATE ⏰ LATE ⏰ SHOW ON CBS 1995-2023: THE END 35:21
Class act.  Love you so much!
I so love you James this is definitely breaking my heart don't quit doing you✝️
I wasn't sure what to expect when he took over for Craig, but he exceeded my expectations! I miss Craig, I'll miss you, but also wonder...who comes next?
How was Jay Leno not in this?
What is the question the band guy asks I couldn’t hear?
I’ll miss car pool and crosswalk musical 😢
Never seen Harry touch his jacket so much
its about time we got rid of this guy good riddance.
Wow. Thanks for bringing so much joy and happiness to all! God Bless!
Thank you James Corden! For your humor, laughter and warmth that you brought into our lives for 5 nights a week, for 8 blessed years! You and your show brought so much joy and happiness to many people throughout your tenure. We will miss you! Best of luck and many Blessings on all of your future endeavors! ✨💖🙏❤️💫
Thanks for uploading the full episode here! 😃❤
Love you James!
Put off watching this until today because of the last goodbye speech .. cause I knew it would make me bawl .. it did 😢so much ..he’s right you know .. look for the joy .. thank you all for being that joy for 8 years 💜
17:53 did the girl that fist bumped Harry styles eat shit then get back up?
And Biden! WTF
having harry on the last episode was so special and a perfect pick🩷
Excellent last show James Corden! 8 years! The Carpool Karaoke was outstanding! Stevie Wonder was my favorite of the Carpool Karaoke! Thank you to the entire staff of the Late Late Show with James Corden!
Dang James here in Shelby nc you got me crying on my God durn couch Thank you
Harry? Really?
This actually made me cry so hard because I love this show so much and like it breaks my heart that after eight years it’s over ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
good
James Corden you’re not funny and glad your show is getting canceled lol
😳😐🙁😕😟🥺😢😫😭😭😭😭😭
Trump 2024
Is no one gonna talk about that girl who just went weak and fell right after Harry Styles fist bumped her? hahahha
K bye.   Now bring back Craig Ferguson
I’m surprised Biden was able to get through just those lines
Let me offer you some advice don’t fall for the trap 666 🪤 is the most evil number don’t give in .   I’m loving you 😂in the end here
So sad that the show ended. I truly enjoyed watching it.
thank you so much J i love you so much for every show and every bit of you're love you left on the stage and gave to many that will remember this show forever... LOVE YOU MAN❤🧡💚💙💜🤎🖤🤍 💯❣❣❣❣
Wait why did this show end?
Thank you ❤️
You just brought so much joy into our life. You are an amazing person! Best wishes to you! You brought us together from so many places in the world!  Always after a hard day at work you were always there to bring joy!  Thank You very much!
The girl that fell after Harry fist bump 😂
Wow They are flushing the toilet on everyone in media
You'll be remembered with all the greats James.
Nice. Well done. You're a good dad and hubby to put your family first. I hope you show us what's next over the "pond" for you. Take Care
Tryna force Biden down our throats. We dont like him boss.
Where is Nick Berstien. ?
Finally
Thanks for making the full version available here. I dont watch tv so would of missed it otherwise. Can't believe its over.
Been watching since he started .. it’s my nightly dose of joy that fills my tank and helps me navigate the rest of this life with a smile .. nothing at all comes close really and I say that as someone who watches all the late night shows every night ! The message from Biden was great ! Thank you James and all the cast , crew , writers, and band …every person that made all this happen for 1200 shows you gave us the very best .. nothing will be the same without you 💜🙏💜
THE FINAL SHOW??!?
Gonna miss you James and crew.  Good Luck James...
You, your heart were absolutely seen by America. We are better for you.
Final thought:WHY do L ATE NIGHT HOSTlook like Agent's in the MIB's
This was great and sad.  When I saw Harryt, I half expected to see Louis, Liam and Niall even  maybe Zane, but no 😔 Atleast Harry came to send James off on his new adventure.
We love you so so much!
Vote TREVOR NOAH for new host if  cbs continues.
👏👏👏🌈💜🙏 thank you for everything.
This show has been motivating me to go to LA and pursue my dream. I graduate in 2 weeks and am going back home as well. I feel so weird and sad. Thank you so much for everything
Late night was a good show before it became democrat propaganda.
Wonder IF all LATENIGHT SHOWS ARE finished
In a world of late night shows  there was one James among the Jimmy Kimmel's and Jimmy Fallon's.... Your show was amazing and really made us laugh and cry sometimes... Gonna miss you James. Thank you to all your team .  Gonna be hard to fill your shoes.
Over the years, whenever I needed a giggle or a mood-reset I would seek out the vast catalogue of James Corden sketches. His humor, his musicality, his humanity and his ability to shine a light on the quirks of life never failed to deliver to me a sense of gratitude, inclusion, and levity. His presence always felt like a big old hug. Let’s hope that he will find another venue to keep us all connected to his brilliant humor.. I miss him already
crazy. I've been watching this show since the first episode with Mila Kunis and Tom Hanks. I was 13 yrs old. introduced to Reggie Watts. infatuated with LA night life. going to sleep happy afterwards. truly thank you for everything!
LOL I DO MISS U."Corden"
will miss you james , have a great life back home
Thank you for sharing your experience! Absolutely in tears, knowing you will leave us for late late. 😭😭😭 wishing you all the best! Can't wait to see what's next!
I got to  O L D to stay awake  I ABSOLUTELY LOVE CORBIN  Missing you bro
Congrats on a wonderful run!
o7
thank you James and the entire crew for such wonderful 8 years ❤️❤️❤️🥹 I love this show sm
What is going on, is this the white man finale? This demographic landscape needs to change.
First show I’ve seen, start to finish,to be honest,just carpool karaoke clips! But I’ll miss him.
Thank god😂
Hopefully they can find a normal down to Earth and non fake person to fill in the slot now.
Going to miss carpool karaoke and spill your guts
So sweet
good riddance
Why was he leaving.
I don’t cry often to movies or videos. But this one got me. I’ll miss you forever James. I’ve watched you for as long as I can remember. You will forever have my heart ❤
GOD IS GOOD 🙏
can’t believe this is really it.
Thank God it's over
Just a bunch of sell out corporate puppets cutting it up
Bit confused on why everyone’s positive attitude, is this like the only good thing James cordon has done/made?
It's heartwarming to see that good people -with emotions even - still exist.! What a great ending to an Era for a wonderful person! You are loved James.....
FINALLY, ITS OVER
Yes this is so sad.... can we bring Craig Ferguson back now?
I’m not crying. You’re crying. Gonna miss James 🩷🩷🩷
I love reggie watts but when seemingly panders to this dude in so many ways its like tf are you doing? Even your the "bit" that made corden famous was a lie...
We'll miss you James. Good luck back in London.
Thank god it’s over. This person never deserved a single episode
God Bless you James and everyone who worked on the show, so many amazing, incredible and talented people. I will miss this show so much!  😥😥 ❤❤ All of you will be missed!! Love you James and sending hugs!! ❤❤❤
We have to move on! Goodbye, James!
I don't see why you have to go David Letterman Johnny Carson etc... Lasted for 30 plus years why are you leaving?
Never replaced..always missed...
Gonna miss your show! The silliness and random mayhem has kept me watching you the whole 8 years! Love you James!!!!!
Mahalo nui e James ❥ツ Mahalo, Mahalo, Mahalo. Looking forward to what you'll be up to next. Mahalo nui!
Trying cringe my way through this...wow 9 min in and its like no one cares if this show is funny
Will looks great with the beard..🧔
Thank you James for all the laughs…. You are loved and we will miss you immensely… god speed ❤
I’ll miss this show, it was my favorite last night program 😢
Well I guess you'll be crying in the rain in London.  Well piss off.  We want to thank your crew and cbs for great memories.  Every decade is hard in human existence.  And always nice to laugh when you can.  😢
Finally I heard that he was actually a cunt and people are finally realizing it now 😂 that’s probably why he’s ending his show
So proud he is choosing family first 💞
So funny!  I am crying laughing.  Best wishes for your future endeavors, and thank you for the laughs.
0/10 stars. Corden fucked up the eggs again. its always the eggs.
I’ll never forget the day you made me late for work with one of your crosswalk the musicals. Thank you James, let’s get loud.
Is Craig coming back?  I might start watching again!
Why is the show leaving
Harry styles the late show taking over the late late show James leaving omg 😱
Squash
Thanks for all the laughs! Especially the laughs where I almost peed my pants. Wishing you luck in your next adventure!
James don’t leave 😮😊
I wish Craig Ferguson showed up. That would have been the piece de resistance!
The other hosts was f👀kin awesome¡💯💯 #CarpoolKaraoke 🎤 🚗
Thank you James Corden and crew for always making me laugh....You all were the best late night show ever....I will surely miss you all......Enjoy your home in London Corden family !
I always looked forward to this show. Ever since the Craig Ferguson days. Thanks to all the people who kept the show going! Hell of a run
Neat
This was sad and yet so beautiful. Thank you Late Late Show. It’s been one helluva ride.
About time this ended 💀
James you will be greatly missed!
Thank you James for everything. You don't know how much joy you gave all of us.
You will be missed

I will miss this show. I love each of you and wish you well. Fabulous fantastic show!!!
James you are amazing ! That’s all I can say 😢
I honestly didn't expect to cry but honestly thank you so much James Corden and the crew worked on the show. My favorite was the carpool karaoke and sidewalk musicals. ❤ The good thing about technology is that we can always go back and relive those moments.
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
James corden is gone… this is the best day of my life 🥹💀🖕🗿
@34:00 We're all in this together! 🤘♥️
Currently crying
Loved the song at the end. So heartfelt and honestly gonna miss him on TV. Wish him and his family all the best♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
🌵 emoji news 🗞️ 😢
❤️‍🔥🤗
Thanks James and staff you will be missed ❤
Ahhh. Soooo many laughs from this show!!!   Damn.
I feel like I've lost a best friend😢❤. Really gonna miss you James.
If this was so easy, everyone would do it!  Thank you James for bringing your talents to the Broadway stage first then having the fairy tale adventure hosting your late late show in LA.  You, your staff, your family and your friends worked hard so we could be entertained.  You gave us your best!  We thank you - job well done.  Safe travels back to your UK home.
Well done James!  You will be missed, thanks the laughs..
Trio friendships never work; this video proves my statement.
Outfreakingstanding show James. Thank you for all the laughs...😅
this is so sad like he entertained us for eight years
We will miss you, James Corden 😢 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Thank God it’s over
Good riddance
I just loved and adored this show
Thank you!
Thanks for all the fun, laughter, entertainment
when  the  powers  first  cancelled  conan   the  usa  was going  thru  dark  times  ,    and  the  powers  kept  conan  as  a  bit  of  a  smile...  now  --
is the token black dude with hand shakes an inside joke?
Not a dry eye in that place! James is definitely gonna be missed. ❤
So sad, I will miss this show.....great farewell show
here's the deal here's the truth of the matter honestly
Rip bozo
Rip bozo
Finally
Bravo
Brilliant! Thanks, James and the outstanding crew, for a really positive and joyous show for the last 8 years!
❤️ Good Luck James!
Thank god
The late night hosts getting together to show him respect & bid him farewell was everything!  Each of them bring something special to the desk, but James Corden is truly one of a kind & will be missed so much.  Thanks to YouTube we can watch our favorite bits over and over and over!! 😂😢😂
Love you James C
I loved this show… I loved all the casts.. and crew… I’m gonna miss James and all the rest of the crew so much 😭😭😭😭
Can someone explain why the show has ended ??? Somebody told me because James got “canceled “ like wtf does that even mean
Almost cried when I saw Stephen Colbert. Not sure why
God bless you 🙏🏽 and your family ♥️ thank you so much ❤️❤️❤️❤️🍾🥂
That was the best good bye I've ever seen a host/entertainer/comedian do on TV. Really the Best and I remember Johnny Carson's farewell. This was so heartfelt. You really could feel James' sincerity. Some want to focus on that incident where he was accused of being rude; well clearly his entire staff adores him. Clearly his guests love him. I'm mad at myself for falling asleep too early most nights. But I'm grateful I got to watch this.
Wait, I'm confused. Why is it ending?
Good riddance
EVERYONE, EVERYONE AROUND
INSANE ONE OF THE BEST LATE NIGHT TV SHOWS IM NOT CRYING! 😢
James you always still be my favorite host I will miss you like crazy it was very inspiring when Harry say he was proud of you to me you always be my favorite host and actor thank you for being inspirational to me
Crazy how many m0r0ns still like this dude after seeing how he treats people. He is trash.
Good Luck With Your Future Endeavors James ♥️🎼🥂🎉
Does this mean Craig Ferguson is coming back?
❤❤❤❤❤
Can’t believe u would have creepy sleepy Scary, Joe on.    Looks like that’s why it’s ur last show.
Great show !! Everything perfect as always❤️ (except the Biden video lol ) I truly wish you lots of blessings
Creepy joe.   Glad it’s ur last show    I use to think u were ok.   U clearly aren’t
Sweet.
17:20 great skit
Thank you for 8 great entertaining years!  Wish you much happiness in London! ❤❤
I’m actually crying I’m going to miss this…
I wish all late night hosts were like James..really funny Really creative  Really brilliant  Full of joy and grateful. I love you James.  Thanks for the lessons, the inspiration, the unity.
Stawp I really thought one direction would magically get back together
Love him!!!!! Don’t go James 😢❤
You will be missed.
About time they get rid of you. Hollywood making stupid people famous. James Corden is a loose cannon, who isn't even funny. He's a joke and so is everyone entertaining all his BS lol
This is the first time I’m watching a full episode of The Late Late Show with James Cordon, and I’m so happy about that!❤️
Can someone help me with the song title at 35:17?
James make sure your exit can be returned if you decide to come back to late late night. When the kids are older. That may be your time. Brady did it. Why can't you James ... I won't say bye I will say see you later... 😊
Why is his show ending?  ❤❤😢❤❤
“how could i resist one more piece of bull’s penis in my mouth” this episode is gold
I will miss this show so very much!!!! Thank you james and everyone on your staff!!! You will do amazing in whatever you choose to do next ❤❤
I'm not crying, you're crying.
I will miss you James. ❤
chills
I am honestly hoping this is an April fools prank and this really truly is not the last show. I keep waiting for them to say ha ha jk. However, this was an absolutely remarkable last episode. This episode was amazing. Truly amazing last episode. James Colbert. We love you and we will truly miss you. I can’t wait to see what the future holds for you. You’re a blessing to all of us, your fans and the earth itself. What a great man! I can’t say enough, I love you and will truly miss you. You’re a saint. And just an absolute one of a kind. Beautiful episode!!🎉🎉🎉 let the party begin!
I don't like the never ending "song" he was "singing " at the end. He was a jovial guy .Sad to see him leave.
I’m heartbroken. Trevor and James were my favorite guys with accents. 😊❤
I'm sad they never got to go on that cruise...
So admirable why James is leaving such a successful show. Take a look at his interview with Howard Stern.  I love Jimmy Fallon and Jimmy Kimmel, and Steve Colbert is great too. But this to me was the best show on late night. Thanks to the Late Late Show team who put it all together for us each week.  I wish James all the best back in the UK. He's making the right decision for his family. I hope he picks up another show there, someday.
❤❤😢😢❤❤
https://youtu.be/Y06vLTRZNKM
they had to pay all those people to show up
James, thank you for all the entertainment you brought to late late show. You are a bright and beautiful spirit and excited to see what you’ll do next. My high hopes is reunion of one direction but…. I know you’ll be fine even if a camera isn’t on you at night. So if that includes a podcast, new musical roles or just being a husband, dad, brother, uncle and son to your family. Thank you to all the crew, unnamed people, interns, all the guest and Reggie. May God bless you all. ❤️
...The fact that this was the final...means people don't wanna see stuff like in on television. TV in general is a waste...only best in natural disasters, super bowel, and things in that nature.

Thank you for the joy, the laughs and the levity you have brought. You've been here thru some very interesting and hard years in our country and you absolutely nailed your goal of bringing joy. this show will be SOOOOOOO missed but I also want to wish you and your family love and success....and joy :) in your next chapter. I'm with President Biden, I can't wait to see what you do next! Thank you to all of you who made me laugh at every lunch break.
Crying
Very heart felt. James you will always be a shining light in this world, a inspiration to us all.  Los Angeles is going to miss you. Godspeed my friend.
James Corden is the goat of late late night 😂 You choose family first over money. I admire that man.....
James Corden for President!!!
thank u 4 bein such a joy to watch! I  luv the queen frontman battle and spill yur guts or fill yur guts and watch em over and over! good luck in london, yur next  big adventure with yur family!!!
I happen to be a wild ass conservative flag waving USA -USA-USA Texan Christian right wing zealot - who loves loves loves this show.  So sad to see it go - a place where we can all agree to laugh at each other and at this life.   God poured immense talent into this humble funny guy
Good luck &whatnot, Mr Corden.  How about Craig Ferguson 2.0?
We love you James!
Thank god. Hes an a$#.
The world will never be the same without the James Corden show. Thank you for many years of amazing memories ♥️
We need more James, not less but as his song lyrics said “It’s time”. Tears, laughter, bitter sweet feelings and I miss it already. Watched the week of shows numerous times. Will miss this talent
I hadn't watched but clips of the Late Late Show after Craig Fergurson left and James Corden took over, and I kinda regret that. James and his team really did bring joy and laughter to many lives over the last 8 years, and what an 8 years it has been. In a weird way though I've never watched a full episode before this one, I'm gonna miss this show.
Im not crying, your crying!
I cant see the other comments because im crying too much but we all love you so much, James, Reggie and Crew! I will continue to rewatch all the monologue and laugh at the title alone! Thank you for all the distraction and laughter and love.
Such joyful and entertaining is our James❤️
Biden was the best joke of the night!
This has been a wide ride and I cannot believe it ended. The videos, the laughs, the friendships, the comedy, and the love that this show has provided I am going to miss. Congratulations James Corden for 1200 episode and thank you for being that light in this cryptic and corrupt world I will always miss you.
I love that James is going back home to spend more time with his family but can’t believe he’ll never host this show again 🥺
James you are so darn funny! I have always loved you!!! Thank you for all of the laughs! I loved the carpool karaoke!! I literally cried on your last show.. You have such a huge heart!! Loved the song! and boy can you sing!! Many blessings in all you do with your lovely family!
Me trying to get my Apple ID password
Will Ferrell.  Funny as a migraine.
How long did Johnny Carson last?
The intro sucked...but hope he does well after this
We love you so much! We will miss you😢
I’m really going to miss this show a lot now because it’s so funny when James Corden does carpool karaoke and all of the funny comedy skits and jokes😂😂😂😂
❤😢
Loved it 🎉
If only all Lat Night along with SNL would end.  One can dream.
I just read why and i admire him for putting time with his son above all
I wonder what he’ll be up to next
Bout time this clown got took off air
Well I was liking it until biden came on....soooo now I am out of here!
I wish one direction was there all together❤
This was such a sweet episode! And so great to watch all in one place. I will definitely miss watching this show. James has been so funny and sincere and entertaining the past 8 years. Thank you so much ❤
Thank you soooooo much.
I'm glad its over haha
This was my childhood comfort show it makes me so sad that he’s never coming back to the show when I found out I was crying for an hour it was bad
thank god its over
What's wrong with you? People anybody that hasn't been living under rock knows what a nasty and official he is behind the scenes but hes so sweet hes so. Kind and he made my life so wonderful as he stepped on people like cockroaches. What the h*** is wrong with you
Best news ever adios
Adios ....GO WOKE GO BROKE.
awww I’m going to miss karaoke carpool 😢
Nobody watches this liberal clown that's why he tanked.GO WOKE GO BROKE
Thanks to a big team that is NOW unemployed....thanks for the memories!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Good riddance see ya bozo
Can’t believe he didn’t close with his Trump rage but at least he had “Brandon” which kind of tells you why he’s off the air.  Glad he had all the other not funny late night host on his last day so they can get an idea of what their in for.
Thank. God.
Liberal woke idiot go WOKE GO BROKE..
*Truly emotional. He really changed late night talk shows. He will be missed.*
Why is his show ending. He is the only one I ever found funny. Sad really
How nasty was he to other people in real life that he was banned from a NY restaurant?
Okay that last comment about America REALLLLLLYYYY hit home. It’s definitely boiled over
Thank you so much for the countless laughs, the fun sketches, and of course all the awesome music! I found your show too late (within the last year) and so i'm sad there won't be new ones, but now I will have to catch up on all the prior ones. Thank you so much again ~ wishing you all much love, luck, and success in future endeavors, and I will look forward to what happens next :)
yes, i cried
Good God...the sheer amount and volume of the screaming in this video is making me want to turn it off.
Wow!Viola on the hunger games!
I never watched his show. Only saw clips. I remember him from lord of the rings.
Why is the show ending ?  Seems like everybody loved it?
Aw man the onions got cut. I'll miss you James.
I'm gonna miss drop the mic.
Gonna miss carpool karaoke. Love James!
I already miss LA
❤ love you James Cordon ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍long live jimmy fallon!
This show has brought me so much joy over the years and made my day more than a few times! You are respected, you are amazing, you are doing the right thing for your family, and you are nothing short of absolute joy! I will miss this show terribly!
No news jingle finale..😢
10 years later still get chills from this ❤
Wait what do you mean  last 😳 🤔  is the show getting cancelled 😢😢😢 can someone explain please!???
Waveform update. ❤❤❤
What a great final episode. Love ya James. 1197 episode total. If James were to stick around for three more episodes then it would be 1200 episodes.
youdid a greaat job James and team.  We will miss you.  Hope you come back and do some specials
Screw him. How do u leave the biggest opportunity of a lifetime! Made his money & ran.  He used us all! I feel violated & robbed!
You will be missed!!!!  Enjoy family time back in England! 🥰
Oh Lord, we will miss you all so much. Thank you for such a good time.
thank god this is over
Wow what a great guy —James thank you
Gods rath is finally over thank god he’s off the air
This was his best show ever (my favorite show he did-and one of my favorite finales).
Glad you brought so much joy to so many good people out there, Mr. Corden.  That’s what makes me happy.  🤗
Good riddance, now get rid of the rest of them.
wow, it started with radiohead. already love it!
Man I’m gonna miss this show so much 😢
Amen
This episode was the absolutely perfect sendoff
❤😂🎉😢❤
He's wearing the same pajamas I'm wearing! 😄
Great way to end it. Thanks James for the laughs…wish all the best for you and your family.
Every ending is difficult; especially when it ends this beautifully. 😢
Crying to get of the US ❤❤❤ JC , you truly are a gem❤ sad to see you go 😢
Give the job to handbag Harry.  He and his grifter wife need a real job.
JAMES YOU CAN'T DO THAT TO US!!!!! YOU NEVER KIDNAPPED ONE DIRECRTION!! But in all honesty, James you are amazing and thank you for being my favorite late night host ever! Whenever I needed a good laugh, I would just come and watch one of your amazing videos that you and your crew have made. I have watched every single carpool karaoke videos that you've ever made. Thank you and we are all so proud of you. Love you lots. Love harry and Will too. I love your crew for making me laugh. I love all of you.
The girl passing out from Harry at 17:51 🥹🤗 that would be me
if MEMORIE  SERVES  ME  CORRECT   , James  was  Craig Ferguson replacement
I will miss you so much! Sending love and  well wishes to your family. God bless you going home ❤
Praise be the lord, the travesty has ended!!
Thank you all!
The late late show with Tom Brady  Late night with Tom Brady
Goodbye Late Late night!!! You have been a source of so much joy. Wishing everyone the best and I know that we will see you all flourish.
Love you James Corden! Thanks for all the smiles and laughs :)
We have more in common than our differences. Let it begin with me.
Funny guy good show the least woke of late night. 🇺🇸
Lol all the plant comments
definitely didn’t have to look away from my screen at the end becuase I couldn’t see due to a breakdown 😅
WORLD CLASS IN EVERY WAY!! THANK YOU JAMES!!!!!!💯💯🏆🏆🏆🏆
James, I'm going to miss you so much 😭
You were the best of the best James!! God bless you and your new adventures!!
we will miss you...the best of luck to you and yours.
Thank you for making me laugh, cry and enjoy time on Earth. You will be missed. I hope you enjoy your life's journey.
I was waiting for Johnny Carson to make an appearance and give him " the rules"! Alas James you will be missed. Rest in your new paradise 💙
What a classy guy
I understand why he wants to step away from it but this show was so special and I can’t think of another late night host that has done what he’s done in only 8 yrs . People hate on him but he is so talented and creative and such a joy to watch . I loved this show and will truly miss it . We love you James! Good luck with everything 🖤
Not sure I'm ready for this show to be over. :(  May need to watch History Boys tonight. <3
Missed opportunity -- Harry could have sang: "Welcome to the final show. I hope you're wearing your best clothes."
So emotional! I'm also sitting here thinking...We are not going to get a Carpool Karaoke of Harry's House! 😭😭😭
Oh man, this is the first episode I ever watched and it was pretty good.
I started watching the show since I was 16, now Im 23 time does fly.... I love how a British gentleman brings my life up to a level of joy that I would never dreamt of. You brightened up my dark days and nights, sir. Thank you so much for being such a great TV host! 🙌🏼🙌🏼❤
James is cool but I think the Conan send was better because he lasted nearly 30 years doing it
James, best wishes in your future! I do want to correct you on one point- we aren't all the same- there's NO ONE like Chump in the world!! The rest of us can find common ground, but he is truly toxic to not only America, but the entire planet. ✌️ Enjoy the next chapter of your life, and especially with your family.❤
17:50 😭
Thank god. Least funny show on tv.
A wonderful soul and entertainer. You’ll be missed.
James, love ya and bless you for doing what is best for your family.  Hard decision, but you are doing the right thing and that is how history will remember you.
i'll always remember james for being the host who introduced me to the weird nerdy gloriousness of BTS. i had seen the AMA performance of DNA, but i wasn't quite convinced... until i saw them play Flinch on this show. I feel like James really went out on a limb interviewing a k-pop group that had just started making waves in the US, the first one to do so, in spite of the fact that their English wasn't very strong yet and (other than RM) they couldn't really answer any of his questions. At one point he tried to get V & JK to talk about how they were feeling and they both just stared at him and smiled, and James just rolled with it. And the fact that the group covered both extremes of the most perfect Flinch performance (V for being an absolute statue and J-Hope for flinching so hard he fell over backwards). That was when I knew how special these guys were and that I was going to be a fan for life. <3
I admire James for leaving the comfort of living in his home country to follow his dreams and make it admirably.  I will miss watching this show, specially Carpool Karaoke. I enjoyed his unique comedy style. Thank you James. We will miss you.
Not Hazza casually flipping the world off when he showed his tattoo 😂   In all seriousness I love all of you I'll miss you. Good luck James!
Thank you James! It was incredible to see you in person at The Late Late Show and even getting a high five on TV from you. You will truly be missed. Good luck to you and your family back in England.
AWWWWWW.....I'M GONNA MISS YOU JAMES....THIS SHOW AND THE CARPOOL KARAOKE WAS AMAZING....THANK GOODNESS WE CAN WATCH THE SHOWS ON YOUTUBE....I WISH YOU AND YOUR FAMILY ALL THE BEST!!!😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️👏👏👏😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️👏👏👏😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️👏👏👏😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️👏👏👏💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐
Good riddance💜♥️💜♥️💜♥️💜💙💙💙
Dear James,    You will be sorely missed, I hope you the best and I know this isn’t the last we’ll be seeing you here in the second circle of hell otherwise know as America. But if you could please at least make some more Christmas specials or shows for Gavin and Stacy I loved the last one. Smithy is one of my favorites characters. Love you! Good luck!           Love,            M
The word on the street is this dude is a real life butthole
I heard James Corden is a scumbag in real life and that’s why they canceled it.
Thank God, I thought he would never go off the air
Oh the the tears I’m shedding ! Thank you James for your love & light ! Best wishes ❤️
What the F…..! Disgusting!!
I feel like I’m losing a family. I’m joyful for all involved to move forward and saddened that this group of huge talent is over. Reruns will still make me sad.
England, thank you for taking him back, can you please take Prince Harry as well
disgusting
WAIT WHAT ITS ENDING???
Good riddance
Thank you James! Tons of laughs over the years!
I will miss the laughs, the smiles, the tears and simply the entertainment that James Corden brought to our homes. Love you James! ❤
We also have one from trump.. got me LOL
HARRY WAS THERE IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU JAMES
I didn't realize he was allowed to leave
BETTER BE JOKING
nooo
Thank you James and the entire Late Late Team for all that you have done in the last eight years. It has been a pleasure watching and laughing at your unique comedy. Take care and bless you all. ❤👍😃
Thank you for so many laughs. You're a champ.
Sob count: 2   and its been 10 minutes.
Thank you for all of the laughter and the music. I and all of America will miss you. Best of luck in your future endeavors. Sending well wishes, hugs to you and all of your families
Thank God. He's a monster who treats people like dirt. Yet, there are still brainwashed idiots who love him.
Thank you to everyone for putting out such a great, fun show!  You will all be missed!
Did not watch one episode...not funny or entertaining at all
good ridence James Corden sucks
I preferred Craig Ferguson, wish he would return!
He could've just had Harry the whole time, lol. He didnt get to say anything. I wish James would stay. He really brought a jolt of fun energy to late night and I loved all the musical skits.
end of an era😭
Good riddance, bring back Craig Ferguson
The best part of this was the David Letterman cameo.
Omg the girl who fist bumped harry at 17:50 immediately fell over 😂
I'm so happy this ended. People support this guy? Like. How disgusting
So good
Wow You have "milked " this last show thing to the very last drop. There are rainbows in the sky. Blessings on your journey.
🥺❤️❤️❤️
This episode needs to be nominated for a primetime Emmy.
That bit with the other hosts was amazing!
I will admit, I wasn’t sure how I’d feel about James after being so into Craig Ferguson as a host. Especially since it felt as though Craig kinda got the spy’s goodbye. Very Low key and almost forgotten. But James and this show really grew on me. They really had fun concepts and helped revolutionize the way late night approached the format.
You definitely will be missed 👍🏽💐
Omg why is this ending ...
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
🤗🌌James you filled the Crosswalks With Broadway ~ You filled cars with Love Karaoke ~ Loved your Swipe Dating ~ Loved the Way you Always Loved Your Guests ~ Do not post anything. NEGATIVE here unless you have a Doctorate in Sociology History Linguistics Physics Geology Volcanics ~  Meteorology ~ if you do your are an uneducated troll with no nowhere to go without any talents.
It’s so good , laughs and Crys . We will miss you buddy
Better than being Lemmoned, I guess.  🤔 ... Don't expect me to group with the cadre of MSMified late night zombie proles, since I haven't watched any of this crap for like 5 years. 🤣
You're a treasure, God Bless you, and blessings for all your future endeavors, James!
James Corden fans are still masked up in 2023.
I am so proud of you, this actually made me cry. im gonna miss this show so much.
Well it was fine until Biden came out😂
Finally Ellen’s Gone , Corden is Gone we just need Kimmel to leave 😍
All the best, James!
Brought us all to tears James and crew/family. 😭 Thanks for 8 years of laughter, fun, and often being our light at the tunnel. It truly takes special people to see past all that’s wrong in the world and help us focus on what’s right. Very best wishes and best of luck to you all. You will be greatly missed. ❤
harry only wears women's clothes 🤮🤢🤮
My son looks a lot like James! 6:52
Thank god the woke show is over
How would I have made it through Covid without you/  Best of luck!
Colin Ferguson was the last, funny, late night host. He focused on being funny, not woke.
The little jerk is leaving. Buh by
17:52 Harry Styles' fistbumps have the power to make women faint  🤣  I would have fainted too being at this show. MY GOD you will be missed James!
What is it ending? What’s going on?
Thank you James for everything!!! For all the love and all the laughs you will be missed! On a personal note I wanted to thank you. You helped me through the darkest days of covid spreading laughter and joy in the darkest time. You helped lift up others and marganizled communities. Thanks in large part to your show and embracing everyone to be themselves I was able to come out to my family and coworkers for the first time and live my life fully, not being afraid and a shell of myself and be proud of who I am. You are a light of hope that has shone sooo brightly and you will be missed. I know you have impacted and helped countless others like me. Thank you from the bottom of my heart and wish you all the best!❤
I don't comment often... But I gotta say - if you didn't shed a tear watching this final episode you just might be heartless.   I'll miss you James Corden
Adiós.
The news segment is one of my favorites, it always made me laugh!
will he be in reruns? I have yet to watch the show.
I shouldn't have gotten emotional near the end
What an incredible last show! I laughed hard because it was so funny.  I also cried because it was the last show.  James Corden is man with such dignity and seems to be so humble & kind.   All the best to you James.  You truly deserve all the best! ❤❤❤
James Corden nailed it.  His final monologue was true and so factual.
Thank you James.  I rarely could stay up and catch the show but it was hilarious every single time I watched it.  I love your personality. I loved your show. You will be missed on late late scene. Never seen a carpool that i didn't enjoy.  Best of luck in all of your upcoming adventures. 🎉❤😊😢
Thank you to ALL! Will follow as many as I can find towards your next adventure 💕👵🏽🙏🏽
Biggest W ever I FUCKING HATE JAMES CORDEN
thank you for bringing my smile back. and thank you for keeping it there. i’ll miss you, james. but hey, with all this time off, maybe you’ll finally get a chance to kidnap one direction, eh? you’ve done a wonderful job, james. ❤️
Good thing we can find the reruns on YouTube
The MOST BRILLIANT… THANK YOU JC for ALL THE LAUGHTER .. 💖🤩
Classy exit Mr. Corden. Cheers to you for the laughs you gave to us. I will never sing in the car or drive through crosswalks without smiling thanks to you.❤
My fav duo is always James and Harry. ❤
Glad this fraud is off the show wooo
yea no the song at the end was my breaking point im sobbing
Truly will be missed❤
😭😭😭💔💔💔
❤
Too bad he was the one who got canceled because of his actions and now the whole crew is affected becUse he was canceled.
This has always been my favorite talk show. So much joy and laughter and music and AMAZING ideas (carpool karaoke and crosswalk musicals will forever live on in my memory). Thank you for an amazing eight years, James Corden. Good luck to you!
Was that desk made of paper mache?
Is the the show on Paramount + bc if it’s not it needs to be. I’m going to miss you James can’t wait to see what you do next.
Thank you James for being such a humorous person who always hosted a humorous show. You will always be and always remain a comedic legend and I will always remember your show and the funny skits/acts you used to do. ❤
spinal tap
lemme guess..he wanted more money and they said nope?
I'm going to miss you so Much❤😢
so glad this awful show is over
FINALLY, can’t wait to see this show off the air. Regardless of what “kind words” the writers wrote for him, this man has spewed mediocrity and nastiness to everyone around him.
I thought he went back to the UK
What a load of shit. Is this for real??? My God what is the world coming to, such bullshit
I cried like a worthless cunt. Thanks.
I've never cried about a TV show in my life... gawd damn you James Corden, I'm gonna miss you... love ya brother!!
It ended when Craig Ferguson left.
Surprised to hear it! There was no notice of it coming to an end?! I enjoyed the Carpool karaokes. The man has talent: his humor, singing, acting and hosting will be missed.  Best of luck James!
Gonna miss you James 😢
I didn't think anyone could take Craig Fergurson's place, but you knocked it out of the park!  I'll miss y'all!  Wishing you all the best!  Love and Peace!
My kiddos 😅 wasn't that the guy from land of the lost?🤔 Will Farrell😘😘
SO glad I chose to watch this! :) Nothing but vibes :D
Thank you for existing ❤️ you’re apart of our lives forever!
James 💔😭😭😭😭😭😭 we love you my babies & I love watching you Jimmy Kimmel & Jimmy Fallon💙💙💙💙
{tearing  up}  I started watching this show during the lockdown-I know, sorry-and i t  brought me, as a healthcare worker, SO  much light and laughter and a feeling of being in a family from afar that I can't even express it...and I'm a writer at heart. I can't thank you all enough for giving me those moments in the midst of so much intense worry, sadness and fear. I have kept watching since. It was just what I did when I got home. I looked for the last night's clips. They have never, ever failed to bring me joy and laughter and I thank you all from the bottom of my heart for sharing your family with us all. I will miss you every day at about 5:30pm. I wish you all a wonderful journey to come. Thank you!
lol….look at Biden, he set I can’t sing 🎤 He can barely talk 😂
Thanks James..my late late hours won't be same...😢❤
That's sad that the show is end  God bless you and your crew
This was a hard goodbye to this great show. James and crew. Thank you for all of the memories. 😢😢🎉😢😢
What a terrible show and final. Paddle fast across the pond and go demean your staff and servers in England.
Aww, Harry made me cry.  Good luck, James.
My cheeks hurt, no really 😢 I just fell out my chair laughing 😂😅🎉❤
❤❤❤
Amazing a Brit has to tell us how fortunate we, as Americans, are - thanks James - you ROCK ❤
Well Done! Well done James
Cheap ass desk.
Good bc that show sucked. He wasn’t funny and come to find out he didn’t really care about the audience or his employees. He’s worst than Fallon and that’s saying a lot.
I know Jimmy Kimmel, Seth Meyers, and Jimmy Fallon but didn't recognize the other 2 men in the bedroom scene.
Now's my chance to take over😉😉
So glad this show is over😀 Hopefully the industry from this massive mistake
❤❤❤❤
You will be missed. Congratulations and this is not the last show in your future.  Great...show.
Radiohead? Really?
Why is he leaving?
Thank god. James is a monster. Always has been. Idk how anybody in the comments can sit there and have a moment about this. He’s a dick.
Is James married?
You ended your show on my birthday.  I started watching you the very first night you came on back in 2015.  Have enjoyed every show.  Thank you for the many, many laughs and fantastic skits....... especially Role Call, and Carpool Karaoke. Wish you and your family all the best in your return to your home country.  Cheers.
8 years of shit. good riddance.
Good riddance!!!!!!!!!!
Finallu
Biden asking "who is that guy?" I imagine is a question that get asked multiple times a day, every day.
Thank you, James for the laughs and smiles. Indeed you were a light. You ARE a light. God bless you 🤍
I never got too watch the show because it was on so late in my area.  But I have watched Carpool Karaoke on youtube and loved the videos.  Good luck on your new adventures and being back in your homeland.
Thank you for the laughs the joy in our darkness. We will miss you James
Woah who loves AI MUSIC🤪🤪🤪🤪
finally!!! This guy sucks
Such a sweet man, so real and so wonderful!!! We need more like him
All of this show and it’s people will be missed, but always cherished! 😢
Thank you James!! It’s sad to see you go! I will miss Carpool Karaoke 😢! Thank you for all the laughs!!!! Wishes and best of luck !
1200 shows congrats to that James
I cried and I’m not ashamed to admit it
James you have entertained us for all these years. Wishing you  and all your family the best of luck on the next chapter! You will be missed but for sure it’s not the last time we see you. You are talented and creative and will continue to shine in that space. One thing only please your parents who I adore should continue to do the NFL Super Bowl bits. I want to thank you for sharing them with us. Good luck! ❤
okok' now i can officialy say i am depressed. Bye James! =[
James is unique!
I miss Trevor Noah, and I’m going to miss James Corden too.
I'm crying - thanks for the moments of light❤
Wow! What a way to leave it all out there 😮 so great to see. All the best James
Best opening!!
Finally out of the air thank God. Lol
I'm gonna miss you Reggie
National Anthem is such a weird choice to open a show
To be one of James Corden's family members or friends in England, knowing: he gave up 50 million dollars to spend time with us. Wow. What a beautiful lesson to teach the world (& hopefully my adult children & grandson too). Thanks for all the laughs & joy. Happy Travels ✈️😘🎶💃🙏❤️
Dear James Corden, The Late Late show I’m going to miss you so much. You became part of my life I feel this show and James Corden itself became part of my family. It will be difficult to know I won’t be able to see this show anymore. I cried so bad when James sang played the piano and all of the people from the show said goodbye. I’m crying right now. Oh gosh never thought this show would be so special. Thank you so much for the joy you gave us. You have no idea how much you impacted our lives. I’m gonna miss you uncle James.
You will never see this comment, but thanks James.
Please please make this the last white male late night walk show host, until there are a minimum of 3 non-white male late night talk shows hosts on the air...PLEASE JUST FUCKING STOP ALREADY!
We will miss you!
Where was Conan
eh...
We will miss you indeed! You are one talented young man! Well wishes!!
WHY? Ashe you leaving us????? We need you more than ever!!! Halve you read the paper today? H are we to not go (more) insane? We need you and Stephen and Seth! I may have to start drinking … again.
Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel, Stephen Colbert, and Seth Myers all in one room together
Thank you James for the Joy
Thank god
RANCID PIG PUKE!!!
the smartest thing is Corden getting getting out of here. He has to protect his family and I cannot blame him to get out. I only wish I could do the same thing. We were once so great. I am so happy for him getting out and living safely.
Is no one going to talk about the girl who passed out ? 😂
AMAZING send off!
This dude isn't funny or talented in any way lol.
😭
An act to always remember. ❤
This made me cringe so hard
I liked it up until you had our dictator pop up and try to talk
I'm going to miss him so much
What happens to these people ? They have no jobs ?
Oh, that's the guy who was in a few Dr. Who episodes. He had a talk show? Didn't know.
Thank you to all who made the show possible! Can’t wait to see what else you will accomplish!! You are one of my favorite comedy giants! Bless you and thanks for making us laugh!
im crying so hard right now! like a kid that got her favorite toy taken away!!! thanks for all the laughs James! ❤
He was amazing.  One of the best. Him and Tom Cruise…hilarious.
stfu this is sad af actually
Harry's equivalent of a puffy shirt...
Thank you James ❤
I remember when he was the one putting in the work asking questions on the streets!! Tonight Show 😢😊
I love you James but I gonna watch the show again and again and again on repeat since the beginning
Huge thank you to James and the crew for bringing joy to my mornings. While healing from a car accident during covid, this show gave me something to look forward to while mostly bed ridden and dealing with pain and brain fog amongst other scary symptoms. I truly believe you all helped me heal. buckets of love <3 <3 <3
Did not think this day would ever come. Never been so happy in my life.
Thank you and entire staff for all the laughs, interviews and serious moments.  Will miss Carpool Karaoke and the singing battles❤️
Thank you James and crew! Remember you’ve always got a home here. May you have nothing but awesome in your futures! Bye y’all. 🥲😢🥲🫶🏼
my ultimate companion when i was hospitalized because of covid. thank you for entertaining me while alone in my hospital bed for 10 days. i will miss you dearly 🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤
I always watched "the news" in the mornings. There will be void. I loved the segment with the other hosts.
The male version of Ellen Degenrous
About time !!
Never watched the show once, didnt know it was still on. Wont miss it and hope she goes back to England
Thank you for everything James ❤
HE STOLE MY WHOLE HEART. ALWAYS HAS... THANK YOU MR. CORDEN FOR THE LAUGHS AND THE MUSIC!! GOD BLESS YOU AND YOUR FAMILY, AND MAY YOUR STAR SHINE EVEN BRIGHTER...LOVE YOU!! 😪😪🤣🤣🙏🏾🙏🏾💝💝👏🏾👏🏾💥💥✨🌟🌟

OK, I see how you guys want to destroy my nose and eyeballs. But I didn't? Oh my God, turn on the water works again. I hope I can make it through the whole 40 minutes here because I'm going to get dehydrated from bawling. Shit😢
😂love will & all the late night fellas 😂that’s classic!!!!😅
it's actually shocking seeing all the late night hosts in one room like the avengers assembling for the first time or some shit
It's crazy to think how many people he just put out of work!
where was Conan great skit  thank you for the laughs
Thanks for all the laughs. Good luck in London
He literally got cancelled for a waiter being mid at his job
Ima check this out to tonight
Thank you James for such a brilliant show over the years. Your show has been an amazing source of joy, especially the innovative bits that your team created like carpool karaoke.
LETS GOOOOOO!!!!
The world is a better place because of this show.
Thanks, James, for your work. I especially loved when you brought on acts like Boyz II Men and Montell Jordan.
I know James Corden didn't have the best reputation, but I felt his genuineness during the end of this show. I think he's definitely going to be missed, but I don't think this is the last we'll see of him. He'll be back I'm sure. Until then, James if you read this, all the best to you and your family.
You guys, I got to say I'm crying the whole way through. I don't do this with a TV show usually, but due to your hearts, and the added effect of the pandemic through which you are sustained me with so much joy, I am just fucking bawling man. this is awesome and sad and horrible and you are all beautiful… I'm blabbering. Like I said, I'm not usually emotional about stars or TV shows, but I guess you just struck a chord with me for a long time now. Thank you hon, even though you get paid and shit like that, I am grateful for your beauty
so happy will said seth was his favorite!! i love seth with my whole heart <3
what a sweet, and lovely person you are James,  we going to miss you.
IS he going back to England because I want to go please take us with you, were all dead meat.
12:40 -------woke------- up the lat night host, get it?
they last one but I am not sure, change that combination on all doors LOL! keep him out!
Love your carpool karaoke, you sing fantastic & crosswalk musicals, and all the goofy things you’ve done to make us laugh. God’s blessings on you and your family. Safe travels home, & I will miss you. You are a kind, sweet man. Thank you for my smiles. I pray you get many times to enjoy your whole family.😘💖🙏 Hopefully time to relax.
Good riddance
Thank god
Going to miss James so much 😭😭 this show was by far my favorite
L
DAVE'S quick cameo was so money!!!!!!!! Did not expect that lol, good luck to ya James. Thanks for the laughs, thnx for the great fun. Cruise's stunts with you are still the best.
Going to miss you James. <3
Congratulations on a joy of a time!
Your seat is procurred on the "plane" to the "island". Thank you for towing the establishment  narrative.
James, Thank you!  Crew thank you  God be with you all in your new chapter in life  God Bless you all
Is our "dear" leader a robot? Looks so fake!
And now as we watch this YouTube channel die
IM CRYING RIGHT NOW, ITS NO ONE DIRECTION REUNION BIT AT LEAST HARRY WAS THEIR. Omg and when he put that little bit with 1d in 😮‍💨 gotta love the guy. We're gonna miss him, the relationships he had with some of these people, incredible. AND NOW WE KNOW THERE WILL BE A REUNION 😭
I must be the stupidest person on earth. I just saw your final shows for the FIRTS time and cant believe I missed out on 12 years of your shows. Boy did i miss out. What a very talent laden show. I'll make sure i will watch your next show.
Oh my gosh, this was truly the final episode? I did not know that and was wondering why it was so emotional… so sad…. I guess everything has to come to an end one day..
Loved 95%of your show. You're a good man and I'm happy for you moving back to England. America, especially California is going to shit and you won't have to be here when it implodes!  Now go back and start listening to Russell Brand! Stay Free! ✨
Thank you James.
Was a great show , he made it youthful and fresh compared to other talk shows on TV, sad it’s ending but on another note he should move to the internet !
I understand completely why he wants to go home, but America sure is going to miss him. Hope he considers youtube as a way to check in with his fans over here from time to time so we know how he and the fam are doing.
Love you all! Fond memories n laughs in the past and bright paths for James and his work family for the future!!
😢😢😢😢😢😢😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😭😭😭😭😭😱😱 we going miss you James Corden  we love you❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤💘💘💘💘💘💘💘❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤💙💙💙💙
Good riddance doughboy
The videos from this show on YouTube got me thru the pandemic..thank you so much for the fun— good luck to all— will miss
@17:53, did she faint??
ALL THE STARS CAME OUT TO WISH CORDEN THE BLUES!!!
I’m so sad I’m crying in bed at 5:50 pm and I’ve just finished watching this. First Ellen and now James. They were my favorite talk show hosts💕
Beautiful last song 😭😭😭😭😭
I'm going to miss the Late Late Show with James Cordon. Wishing him and his family lots of blessings.
Thank you James for always putting a smile on my face before I went to bed I wish you all the happiness in the world with the kids and r wife...enjoy r life we will miss u dearly..God bless you 🙏🙏
https://youtube.com/@Keenenknowles_solarken
Thank you soooo much! I'll never forget when you did the show w Demi in those kid's house😂😂😂😂
17:53 did that lady just fall down after fist bumping harry styles?
I didn’t know he could sing like that I’m soooooo sad
Well said James. Well said! Excellent, moving ending! 😭😭😭🙏🏾🙏🏾🖤🖤🖤
Wow I am going to miss this show so much!! I loved every part of the show!! It was so unique!! I Loved carpool Karaoke the most!!
I lost it when Ian started crying 😭 this show was crucial in so many people’s lives. Thank you all, for EVERYTHING.   Thank you thank you thank you. Never take these videos down because I’ll be rewatching all of them.   (Ian, Portland misses you! Come back soon!)
You have 50 other late night shows that are way more funny than this bum
Thank you James! Thank you….
When I awake in the middle of the night (yeah, it's often), I turn and look at my beautiful, adorable, loveable ,kind, sweet and gentle CAT. Yes, I love my cat but it was depressing a bit to have just her in the bed. So I'd turn the TV on and there would be James Corden. One time he was making Steven Tyler eat one of the disgusting foods. I laughed so hard, i almost peed. I was hooked. Loved his carpool Karaoke's. He's been the best Late Late Show Host E-V-E-R. Trust me, I've seen a lot as I'm 61 yrs. old. But inside, I'm in my Late Late 20's!
I smiled this whole episode! On to the next chapter JC 🌟🌟🌟
Hello James Kimberly Cordon, thank you for the memories, the joy that happiness, and the love you put in our hearts. sadly I couldn't follow a dream, a dream to be on your show because of the long distance between us, Now all I can say is let us wipe these tears and thank you for all the incredible time we spend watching you talk, smile, cry and of course laugh.  Thank you for putting together the most incredibly talented crew. And of course, thank you for being you.  At last, it's been a pleasure and a glorious ride James, Your friend, BoshehriQ8
Didn’t watch this very much, but when I did it was enjoyable to watch after work on weeknights. Thanks James and enjoy spending more time with your family. #Respect ✊🫡
The mission… the nightmares… they’re finally over
I hope this is the last time we hear from crazy James. What a horrible human.
I’m gonna miss you James🌟🌟🌟your a super🌟
I Just wish you well, Hope you find Humility and with that true happiness.
Yaaas Radiohead!
I watched the show from time to time. My favorite part was when he sang in the cars with different celebrities. I may not agree with everything he belies in but he certainly made the show so fun. Oh! I also loved when they performed on the crosswalk! So hilarious! James is so talented and so funny. I'll definitely miss him. Good luck with everything James!!!❤️🙂
Why is he dressed like someone's aunt 🤨🤣🤣🤣🫡🙄
Thanks for the memories James....and thanks for asking Harry Styles to wear his pajamas on  your last show :)
.....good riddance!....nobody gave a goddamn about that bore of a show, anyway.
Thanks for 8 years of amazing shows! I just have to say that some of my favorite shows were during the pandemic when there was no audience, and we really got to know everybody in the crew, and the camaraderie that existed between all of you. I was actually sad when you started bringing audiences back in because I loved those interactions so much!!!
It’s crazy. All those people cheering in the beginning are probably all employed by this show. I remember when the shows ending was announced, Twitter cheered bc they don’t like this guy, but all those people are affected as well, not just James Corden. Good luck to everyone affected by this ending
Luv me some James Corden & Carpool Karaoke! He's such a treat! 💜💜💜
Good riddance.
Also I think the comments James made after school shootings and other tragedies that occurred in the US and around the world were always touching and thoughtful.
I've never understood the appeal and he's an insufferable @$$ so good riddance. Britain didn't like him so he came here and the people that like him don't even like him they just like Carpool Karaoke. 😂 Conan is the late night 👑
38:30 was the lamest part.
hes a sweet guy... he was amazing as Craig on DR WHO
Good riddance!
Pure talent! You will be missed. What a great show it was.❤
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
James, you will be truly missed in Late Night. We look forward to what you do next. 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾❤️❤️❤️
Look for the Joy
Tom Snyder and Craig Ferguson were two of the best to host "The Late Late Show" I'm not counting Craig Kilborn. James Corden held his own and made the show his own. Whoever the next host will be , they will have some to shoes to fill.
Godspeed James!
Im laughing and crying at the same time. We'll miss you James! Can't wait for your next venture!
Thank god is gone from the Airwaves!!! Good riddance!!!
Biden Has to read a teleprompter. Surprised he didn't mess up
😢
James you have truly been a beacon and light.  I love your authentic self and wish you and your family safe travels across the pond!
Damn...it's like losing a good friend. Can we hope to see a British version of The Late Late Show?? I'd tune in nightly for that!!
Ever since hearing the reports on how James Corden treats restaurant staff when he goes out to eat, I lost all respect for him.
im gonna miss him 😭😭 he’s such a funny host. i hope u have a wonderful starting journey and life. THIS IS SO SAD 😭✋🏻
I like his show and I will miss it. It is entertaining and funny. What I don’t like is him being political and his comments / jokes in this area  are adding to the division of the country
This show with James has literally introduced to me to some of my now all time favorite celebrities. This show has brought me so much joy and laughter, so many adventures, it’s just incredible and there are truly no words to express how amazing it has been. I only joined the fandom a few years ago but it was truly the best decision. i love you James🥹im gonna miss you so much.
Didn’t realize how much this show meant to me until they announced it would come to an end. I’ll miss watching it every morning
if i see a single catch and release your done! only cut the chordes lock em up and bring me the next victim! no saving only reseting deletion is the action of reset- lock em up throw some beasts and let them feast - cana ball ism or carnivores idc just do it
Love James 💜
Something tells me in 20 years time he will be back for one last ride!
Powerful ending. Best to you and your family on your newest adventure, your crew too!
ILL MISS YOU JAMES 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Thank you all for all the fun, the stupid, all the silly, all the live. Best of luck and I hope your opportunities are endless
I am going to miss him sooo much!! I can always count on him for a good laugh. 😂 Thank you James!!! ♥️🤗
🙏 BEAUTIFUL.. brilliant show, James Corden ... THANK FOR MAKING ME LAUGH.... and cry... GOD BLESS 🎶😎😂🙏🧠🕯️🤘🐦☑️😉
I love you... Thank you 37:20
the last 8 years have been so fun and enjoyable with you and your team james. im so sad this show is coming to an end, as a harry styles and one direction fan im really gonna miss the moments you had with them and the fun videos you made for us to watch!
YOU GO WOKE, YOU GO BROKE ***************************************************************************
Glad I could catch this recap on You Tube. What a ride, but not the last stop.  I'm sorry I couldn't stay up a half an hour longer to catch this as it aired in Philly ; which is my home. I love James Corden and acting on Dr. Who is what brought him to my attention. Glad that his Mum, Dad and sisters joined his send off. Well done and I pray you enjoy time with your wife and kids as you go back home to the UK. I send my love and prayers for  continued success in your new endeavors. I'd love to take a trip to London. Here's to seeing you across the pond.💋
Fairwell James 😭😭😭 you brought joy to me with your show, even in sad times, much love and keep shining Uncle Barry
Too effin funny.
Yaaaaaay this host is terrible. I hope the staff finds work quickly. 🎉
🥹😭 thanks for a great 8 years!
This man is a treasure. He's such a kind and decent person. He's the kind of person you would trust with your children.
he was absolutely incredible and change late night shows my favorite by far you are a legend james
Must feel bad man. Tucker Carlson's 2 minute Twitter video has about 100 times the views. Lmao
I am glad it is over :D
ahhhhhhh Farewell.
just cried like a baby.
Y’all really helped give me some stability and comedy during the lockdown & I’m grateful for that. Great exit & best of luck to the whole team ❤
You gotta help me, I'm losing my mind Keep getting the feeling you wanna leave this all behind Thought we were goin' strong, thought we were holding on Aren't we? You and me gotta whole lotta history.  Thank you so much for the entertainment James and all the love you have given us in just 8 years. We will always remember these wonderful moments and have this marked in our memories, and just keep in mind that when we feel bored or lost we can always come back to these moments by just pressing one of these videos and laugh our faces off again. We love you! ❤
Thank you James and the whole entire crew for bringing us Joy!!!  I will miss the spill your guts the carpool karaokes!! Wishing you and your family the very best!!
I’m gonna miss it so :(
I love you and you have brought so many fun memories and laughs. THANK YOU!  I pray for success for you and your family, privately and professionally. I hope we see you in the future doing stuff, even if it’s in England. Enjoy your family. Sending you many blessings and well wishes.
I watched the late show every now and then but tbh I didn't buy his whole sad the show is ending act he never even shed a tear. I believed Ellen was sad her show was ending more than James, the whole first 30 mins was taken over by the other late night hosts and their bit; I am guessing he ran out of ideas this show is boring and glad it ended. Not surprised if the rumors about him are true and its his own fault his show came to an end!
I would have LOVED to be in that last audience ❤️❤️❤️
I cheated. I used a VPN the first time ever to watch this as it's locked to the US, and not available in the UK! 😂😂
Now that’s how you end a show
Thank You, James, the Tom Cruise skits were terrifying but hysterical! But I'm glad you were always his sidekick for them! Incredible Job bravo
Would’ve been more enjoyable if he wasn’t such a shit person to work with
James, you're the best!  Thank you for all the joy and laughter you brought to millions of people. Con mucho carino  y bendiciones siempre. Much love❤❤🙏🙏https://www.youtube.com/s/gaming/emoji/7ff574f2/emoji_u2764.png
I know they did not exclude Leno in that bit. Shame.
How long did he do this show?
Good riddance! Go back to your rock
James, you all served your viewers excellently! I believe Johnny Carson would have truly loved watching the show! Although it’s a drag you will not be continuing we’ve listened to you express how important your family is to you. Congratulations on making a great decision , and thank you for being a positive influence to your audience across the world! I wish you all the best, I hope you occasionally participate in televised special events, and don’t disappear into society’s background. You definitely deserve to have your picture alongside Johnny Carson’s!
I don’t know Why But I’ve always wanted to see him dance And sing to Prodigy fire starter
Gonna miss him and all his shenanigans. He brought originality to the late night TV talk show format.   James makes it all look so easy but he is immensely talented and willing to do pretty much anything.
Saying goodbye is always heart wrenching but without a goodbye, there would never be 'hello'.
👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏
It's a beautiful end to a funny, funny show. Wish I was able  to "like" it more than once! Enjoy the next chapter of your life, James! Bravo!
Wonderful. God Bless you all.
He the most I've ever seen. Efure
Whos more talented I wo Der who ummmm hs duh
Finally he’s fine thank god
good journeys sir
James Corden. Meh.
Big shout out to all the other late night show hosts I’m sure they’re going to miss James like we are 🥲
This really sucks. I remember during the pandemic, this show really helped me a lot. And even up till now 😢. Good luck to James and the whole crew. I totally understand, life is going by and he wants to be there for his family
If James Corden wasn't famously the worst, i'd be so sad.
Thank you dear James and the fab Late, Late Show team. We will miss you. Kudos on your touching take on the division in our beautiful country. We CAN disagree and still love one another. As Harry says, TReat People With Kindness! ☮️💜💚 I wish you you the very best, James. Enjoy your family time. Wise decision. Thank you to CBS for airing the entire show for those of us who live abroad!. ⭐️💜🙏💜⭐️
How can anyone not like James Corden?
Thank you James and all of the crew members for everything you've done for the past 8 years. I hope all goes well, The late late show has been one of my favorite talk shows for about four years now, thank you for the laughs, memories and more.
Thank you for this show!
sad to see this show pass on i hope cbs fills this time slot with comedy
Well that’s a freaking bummer……
Do people really believe that Biden even knew where he was or what he was saying?
End of an era. My family and I shared countless laughs and tears with you guys. Thank you for everything, James and crew. ❤
Very few people actually care about this Fat Talentless Hack.       This show was meh !!!!
Welco.e to the final show
Damn the ending song kinda got me sad. I am really gonna miss Reggie he was my favorite part of the show
Good Riddance!!!   Go away please!!!!
So awesome!!!❤
Since James has left the CBS Studio who will host the new late late show?
thousands of hours of entertainment, thank you James!  the only let down was after his Talk-Show Host Nightmare he didn't wake up to Conan laying in bed beside him to comfort him.
Going to miss James  cordens  show
Man gonna miss carpool karaoke
👎 Bad Silly Idea for this Final Show (overplayed nonsense about being locked out of stage door) A Final Show to what was a great late night series SHOULD BE a BIG Star Studded event with maybe a HUGE limo karokee of stars or some other splashy send off... Oh well... I will still miss what was a great late night series
You carried me through lockdown 🙏
Thank you James Corden and the entire late late crew for 8 years of this amazing show!
Damn. Never watched the show. But this made me cry. So he's just going bk 2 England?
I’m going to miss this show so very much 😢 thank you James!!!
Good riddance! I never liked him!! And the only reason he's leaving is because of that restaurant scandal from a couple of months ago. And people turned away from him.
💜👍🏽💛Laughter through tears is a beautiful thing.... Grateful for you James, truly!!!   . .and I'm quite certain that wherever U step.. as the future unfolds.. JoY unspeakable will be there too!!    🌏👏🏽
Love James Corden. Can't wait to see what he does next. Another Peter Rabbit movie, please?
Thanks for the great show James! Whatever you do next, I'll be watching.
We are going to miss you James Corden❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ thank you for making me smile, laugh and cry! Blessings and so much Aloha🙏💜🌎☮️🌎💜🙏
The late night host bit was *chefs kiss*
We love you james... thank you so much for bringing so much laughter and joy to us over these 8 years. Wishing you Many blessings 🩷
This was brilliant. ☆
thank god this shit is over. What a horrible tv personality
I've been watching you   starting from your very first show.  I was impressed then and could not be more proud now.  We love you so much, James Corden!!!  We're curious to see where your next journey will take us. XXXOOO 💖
Bawling my eyes out
CANT BELIEVE THAT IS OVER. I'VE ALWAYS LOVED THE SHOW
I'm a sour old man with no particular love for these people and I still cried
Unfortunately life is one big series of ending’s
Yup we’re the same ,  even working 36 years just made a 100k
I’m like 2 seconds into the video and I’m actually already sad.. James corden has always been the most entertaining talk show host to me, and has great chemistry with all his guests. really will miss his humor and especially carpool karaoke :,)
Time for Craig Ferguson to come back 😅 I love James as you but I miss Craigy Ferg
Good riddance
Thank-you James for that beautiful speech, I know we have problems and it seems like we are throwing it all away, but I will always have hope for us.  Thanks for always trying to be in the middle and not taking sides.  Good luck and enjoy the rest of your life. Love your parents they are adorable.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Why is it his last show? I love him.😢😢😢😢
He is the definition of a humble man. He will be so so missed. Love youuuuu
Aw man he’s so cool and Ana maxing person
Bro thinks he can use radio like this
Can't love this enough! You're such a bright light James. Thank you for 8 amazing years <3. We ARE more alike than we are different.
Thank you James and the team for all your hard work and the joyous energy you created and put out into the world! You will all be very much missed!
Harry Styles       is   the    best.
Can’t believe this show has come to an end. Loved this show so much brought so much joy in to my life😢
James so classy and in style  ....You will be missed !
Jimmy Fallon - Seth Myers - not many are left
We love you James! Thanks for giving us an amazing 8 years!!
This gave me chills we love you so much James 🥹💕💕🫶
Bummed Conan didn’t make it into the late night bit
Big loss to the world, hope to see what's next James, you rock!
Crosswalk musicals were my favorite.  Also loved his skits.  The Carpool Karaoke with McCartney had me in tears.  Thanks and farewell, James.
even though he was a jerk and all these rude reports of him being a rude prick... with the whole BTS thing... and now he's cancelled... sucks.  but wish him the best.
Holy crap I’m crying like a baby I just watched this whole episode
Harry Styles:) Harry is MULTI-TALENTED all the way.....
We're going to miss you 😢
Thank God it’s over!! 🗣️🙏🏽🔥🫡
blocked in EU, why
Thanks for all the laughs over the years James! You will be missed in the late nights. This was the perfect ending! 🥰
I'm sorry but was i the only one who saw the girl who fainted after getting a fist pump from Harry?😭🤣 at 17:50
ok isn't Conan O'Brien a late night Host too - HELLO.  Why are you all leaving him out of the mix for Late Night Hosts.  He's amazing.....
OW THIS FOOKIN HURT
Just your own carpool karaoke show, that was fun to watch.
These late shows are all bitter angry unfunny crap. None of these guys are classy like Johnny Carson.
I cried during his speech  I will miss seeing him on our late late show 😢😢😢 I’ll miss you james
God bless you and all the team.
😢😢will miss you so much, James and all of the late Late team ❤ I cannot wait to see what exciting new things you create going forward ❤ thank you for all the joy, especially during the pandemic 🙏🏻❤️👏
Thank you James and crew! Thank you for bearing with us for the last 8 years! You will be missed so so much! Love y'all ❤️
If you need someone to wake you up,  let’s have Micheal McIntyre wake you up!
REEEEEALLY wish they could’ve found some kind of way to paying tribute to Conan as well during the late night skit. Seems as though the talk show network has bullied him out of this category..
ABOUT TIME HE LEAVES LA.
I love you James Corden.  All the best wishes for you and your family as you return home.  You are the best!!!!!
The Radiohead open is dope!
Beautiful end!
love you for everything man
I can’t stop tearing up through out this whole episode. I’m going to miss it so much!
So bummed out
You are going to be missed.  I have enjoyed your show so many times.
Loved the speech at the end; this whole if you don’t agree with me then you are the enemy mentality is garbage.
So bummed, but understand why he's got to go. 💔 Will miss all the carpool karaokes,  & James Corden! Thanks for all the laughs!
❤
Good riddance!
Why did they close the show?
Thank God. We’re finally saved from this hack
We’ve all felt this type of panic, makes you feel less alone to see it like this.
Wow...this awesome guy made me cry so much.
I stopped watching during quarantine. Got too divisive. Happy to watch last show.
The only thing that sucks harder than this show is james haha.
not surprised he would eat bugs after eating random peoples gum in elf 🤢
How did you do it, Reggie? Sing that last bit without a tear in your voice after James left so beautifully and so elegantly...
Harry Styles sure does have a weird fashion sense
Thanks James, and everyone else at the Late Late Show! We will miss the laughs! ❤
This show was always a comfort for me to watch both on TV and on Youtube. I am truly going to miss it and you, James. Thank you for making it a safe space to feel all the feels.
Nice to see that Biden is as clueless as ever.
"Peter Rabbit 2", anyone?
All of those people lost Production Jobs.
Ew ... Biden .... Really 🤮
i wanna say good for you but at the same time i wanna say fuck you
DID ANYONE ELSE SEE THE GIRL FALL OVER AFTER HARRY FIST BUMPED HER
say what you will about James as a person, but he really gave us a show this past 8 years! Congrats on your run, and thank you and your crew for providing hilarious, entertaining, and viral moments in pop culture!
You are and will always be my favorite.  I can't wait to see what you do next!
What a fine man!!! A true jewel! We'll miss you!❤
<3
I started watching this show 7 years ago..where I would laugh and enjoy the show so much. Going to miss this show so much, but thank you James and the late late crew for the memories and laughs. Also, Having Will and Harry for the last show was the best choice ever..love them and love you all🥹💜
Damn 😢 in a miss the interview! One of my favs was the was with the infnlinty war cast!! U did an amazing  job with that being said I’ll miss this so so much!
Saw James’s show live in LA was a great time James and his staff were very kind. James spoke to the audience and answered questions before filming. Reggie sang in the crowd with us during breaks. Jordan Spieth gave me one of the golf balls he was hitting at James during a skit. And we saw the stranger things kids film a fun dance skit. Great show, everyone couldn’t have been nicer, and an amazing memory!
What a beautiful way to end the show. Thank you for entertaining us for these years James. I've watched here and there, but made it a point to watch this one. I'm glad I did. <3
James you're going to be missed. Good luck with the next project & your move back to England. You Rock!!!
Noooo Ugh.. I just started watching and 24 seconds in, I just don't feel like I'm ready for this ugh... Here come the tears.
This show sucked 😂
Good riddance to the pretentious man!
Biden saying “who was that guy” is typical Braindead Biden
thank you James and the late late show team for putting a smile on my face everyday with the show. i'm really gonna miss it soo much
Good riddance to bad rubbish. Hopefully Jimmy Kimmel what will be next😊
Love James Corden ❤️ going to miss the show! Best wishes in all your future endeavors.
Did that girl fall down or pass out after Harry came out? 17:50
Happy new journey James 🙏🏻♥️
POTUS didn’t even know who he was saying goodbye too 😂. He just knew you sent Hunter more blow money 💰 😂. Anyway, wish you the best….could’ve done without the bs political junk
He puts on this act of being the most friendly person ever but I guarantee he has NEVER said hello to half those people at the start of the video let lone given them a smile or pat on the shoulder.
This seems to be the only comment thread on the internet where James Corden is not being ridiculed and called out for horrible behavior.
🫡
You're welcome James. Best wishes mate to you and the Late Late crew.
17:52 did the girl faint?
I’m glad they’re ending the late late show bc no one could replace James ❤
Thank you James thank you late late
Stop. Don’t. Come back.
Did that girl pass out when Harry fist bumped her???
You will be missed so very much. Best wishes in your new endeavors!!
This made me cry, i absolutely am gonna miss you and this show and all the laughs, Harry being there made my entire year i just adore him and will too! Gonna miss this show for sure ❤
Gonna miss ya and everything you and your crew do!!!  :)  You are the only one that cracks me up the most!  Good luck and Thank you for every tear in my eyes from the laughter and thanks for the memories....  Cheers mate!!
All the best to James and the crew!  You got me through some dark nights! I started watching you when I was living abroad and I'm sad to see you go.
Very good show but why was the desk demolished?
I didn't watch this show very much, but I always enjoyed James Corden, he's a nice guy and I'm sure he'll be missed so much.  Good Luck James!  I hope your life is what you really want back in the UK.  Hoping that you visit LA at times; it's a crazy place but it's a great place to be. (from Sandi)
I don’t think James spent enough time on his guests. It’s almost like they weren’t there. We got a little like Andy but I think he could’ve spent a little bit more of his time on them.
I still can’t get over the girl fainting in back when Harry first bumped her 😭 17:50
2 words, Reunion Cruise🎉🛳🎉🏝🍹🎉
Why are ppl screaming ? I can’t hear the host it’s annoying
Good riddance. The show was subpar and as we all know now, Corden was an a-hole.
Okay so between James Gunn and Harry Styles can someone please tell Hollywood that the huge parachute pant bell bottoms look isnt good.
Thanks for all the laughs and smiles!❤❤❤
Best episode ever ❤
GOOD RIDDANCE! Finally this garbage is done.
❤ ✿❧🌿❧✿ ❤
Wonderful show to end a fabulous eight year run ❤
Cant wait for the new movie with tom cruise and james..hint,hint
The best late night show ever!
The way Harry kissed James dad head was so sweet... Love this guy!
Harry is so sweet omg that choked me up
I have a question Reji... what's the ingredient of time..... that this show will come back?
Letterman's laugh is everything!
Good riddance
Bravo! That's all l can say thru my tears. And thank you James, the whole crew, the Prez, both Jimmys, Seth, Stephen, Dave..
💞 don’t be sad it’s over, be happy it happened 💞
Tears all 40mins, man!
So glad it’s over
Stay safe in London .
James, I just wanna say we will miss you 🤍 and thank you for always making up laugh throughout the years . Watching your final episode brought tears into my eyes and I know many of us could relate❤️ Can’t wait what the future brings for you and your family I wish you all the best
James is the BEST!!! I absolutely LOVE and ADORE him. His original and outstanding natural humor is second to none. Oh how I will miss him in this “platform”❤ 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
He’s was right about making a late night show fresh and different. I’ve loved this show this much and I’m going to miss it so much! Here’s hoping James will do a new show in England when he gets home! Thanks again cbs and James corden for the laughs!
Good luck in whatever is next for you.  It's a brave decision, and I applaud you.  You are one of a kind, an amazing talent, and London is so lucky.  Best of British to you and your family !!
I will miss carpool karaoke, his humor, his openness, and just him..
Good riddance 😌
I'm not ready for this😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Your allyship has been invaluable.
Crying at the girl falling down after fist bumping Harry 😂
You're going to missed so much but, your decision to put family first is a testament to the great person you are.
He really didn't want to leave...he was forced out. Turns out pushing the vax and shaming Americans is not a good way to get ratings.
Good riddance to the fake sell-out.
James I want to wish the best of luck in your adventure although I don’[t think you really need it. You are super talented. Thank you for 8 great years of laughter and joy. Car pool karaoke was the best and your screens with Tom cruise and others were also the best.  You making me LOL always came at the right times. I will miss your show. Thank you and best of luck
Thank you for the laughs in a time so needed.  Will miss your cross walk shows and carpool karaoke but most your positive humor.  Can’t wait to see what is next for you.  Wish you the very best and many blessings. ❤️
Wishing all of you the very best.. thank you for all the moments of laughter, especially during some very difficult times in our lives. ❤
We will miss you Papa Moche 😂
what a sent off. Kind a funny actually is the first time i watch a full show and will be the last time.❤🎉🙏
Harry makin me cry!!!!
Thank you for the happiness James and crew!  Your show will be missed and remembered with joy and smiles :D
Oh My God! It was funny when all the late night guys walked out...Seeing Letterman was a treat, but the bit with Masked Singer had me rolling! I about died when I realized Trevor Noah was up on stage with James hahahahahahahaha
James - Thank you for such great entertainment and years of laughter. Best of luck in your new adventures.  Harry - You are NOT a flash in the pan!!  BTW...You going to ever post the footage you cut from this finale? I know there was at least 1 conversation about the Grammy's that didn't make it to air, so wondering what else there is. Do an extended version of the show on YT please!
Thank you James you were awesome. Good Luck in England and whatever you choose to do next! Peace!
I was half expecting a guy in the audience with a lighter yelling , " I saw his last show"!
Thank you James for every episode you ever done that was having a bad day you brighten it you will for sure be man go home and take care of the family........ 😢😢😭😭😭
💜🙏
Miss you too!
Where’s Conan??? 😭 where’s Conan where’s Conan where’s Conan

it's too bad it's over. I was looking forward to him eating more bugs
Thank you James you did so much changing Late night and thinking outside the box. Have a Beautiful life and enjoy your family God Bless.
I'll miss this show so much, Congrats ❤❤
I wonder if Tucker Carlson was able to say goodbye the same way.
Well done!
Why is his show ending?
I LOVED the song at the end. I'll miss this show so much. All the best!
I’m gonna miss carpool karaoke, spill your guts and covering someone’s work shift. Loved the show. James always made me laugh!!
Does anyone know what song he parodies at the end. I know I have heard the music before please help
The after party had to be amazing lol..
That is one heck of a goodbye well done James and team  I will miss you all a lot good luck back home and I really hope you get round to a bit more Gavin and Stacey 😂🎉🎉🎉
This should not have made me cry as much as it did.  James, thank you for all the laughs, the carpool kareoke's, the risking your life with Tom Cruise, all to put a smile on our faces.  We appreciate you.  God bless you and your family, and whatever it is you choose to do in the future.

So glad your trash show is over
I’m gonna miss him!😭🥰
An end to a glorious era of late late night talk show history. James and his cast and crew have always provided a levity that was not only unique and entertaining but also so necessary through a pandemic that crippled the nation and destroyed lives. He also helped during COVID too. We'll all never forget you and the countless amount of joy you've enriched our lives with throughout the years. Thank you James and thank you cast and crew. Leave with pride on a job incredibly well done. You will all be missed.
Freakin' hilarious opening tonight!!!
Hahahahaah goodbye weirdo!
good, James is a piece of shit to so many people, and doesn't deserve his level of fame, he literally popped up out of no where and were told that he is famous and to go with it.
I wonder what he's doing right now?
This is Epic. One of the best late night show. Just too bad that you are leaving too soon!!! Wishing you the best of Luck
Will Farrell has officially struck the set! LOL 😆
🎉🎉🎉Congrats and thanks for everything.  You really made a difference for all of us. Home is waiting.  They need you buddy. 😢❤🎉
Good luck to James and his family. I can see him continuing to do theater and musicals. He's very talented.
One of the funniest corners of the universe just closed. We need more laughs and smiles nowadays. Hopefully more will come 🙏
James, You and the crew and the band will never know how much you helped us all to get through some really tough times when the world was in a shut down! It was ones like yourself and all the ones behind the signs that worked SO hard to shed some light towards us when we were under such dark clouds and our country was being LIED too! So I only wish you and your precious family will be back on your home land and enjoy being with your entire family in England! Your Loved always here in the United States and your family to us all here also forever sir! With the Creators blessing and may you always remember that the smile you put on my face each night will now be your smile forever!!!
I will miss the carpool karaoke and the Tom cruise videos 😂👍😊
Ok, I'll say it! He's dressed as a banana, he's dressed as a banana, ey-ey!! 😄😄
We’re all going to miss you terribly. But you have to do what makes you happy. Thank you for all you have done over the years for all of us. Congratulations and good luck on the next part of your chapter!!!
Forever love this show! So sad about it!
Praise Jesus, the runaway meatvall is gone.
He will be missed
I love this show.   Thanks for 8 years of laughter & fun.  James Corden & crew you will be missed!
Thank you for the laughs
I'm going to miss watching you so much! Great Luck in your future! Love you❤
I will really miss this show. Thanks for all the joy and laughter. It was so often needed.
i cried like a baby! we love you james!!
as much as I really like James...you all needed to keep tiny Tom out of it.
Ive heard many bad things about James Cordon on how he's and asshole to everyone in real life. Bad shit happens to bad people
It’s sad but I do feel like James is fake . I went to go see him live for his show and he was just the rudest to us audience. Didn’t even   acknowledge us.
Shame it couldn’t have been Stephen Colbert’s last show instead
Thank God this guy won't be a late night host anymore.  How America ended up with an "America's Got Talent" show that features mostly foreign acts and is judged by all foreigners (Brit, German, Canadian & a Columbian).  Then our late night hosts are a Brit, a Canadian and the rest are Jewish.  American culture is eroding and the elites have been pushing for that for years.  Wake the hell up America!
Thank you James and crew for so many years of singing and laughing together. I had a great time at one of your tapings. I even got a shirt from your team!! Brian Cranston was one of the guests. You will be greatly missed. Wishing you lots of rest and fun times with your family. You are so deserving!! Cheerio!!❤️🥰❤️
This happens to me every time I try to get into my bank account, lol.
I'm really going to miss carpool karaoke 😢💯
Oh James C. We will miss you. You never failed to make us laugh.
Will came so that James and Harry don't cry.
this has me so emotional
I will miss James, Reggie, Ian and the rest of the gang.  This was a must watch every time it was aired.  I will be lost without all of you.  I wish all of you all the best in your future. xxxooo
Trevor from the Daily Show, now you. This is heartbreaking. We will miss you James. A farewell to an icon.  I hope Stephen, Seth and the Jimmy’s don’t leave too. This was an avenger moment for the late late shows. This could of been a movie.
I watched your show in the beginning (I'd watched Craig Ferrguson's too). Loved it and watched a lot on Youtube (especially Carpool Karaoke. I'm sad you couldn't get BTS for another episode but that's no big deal). Best of luck to you and your family in everything! <3
No Conan?
I can’t remember how many times I’ve watched every episode of your show on YouTube again and again because it’s my stress reliever. You are an extremely talented person. Surely I will miss you. Love you James ❤❤❤
i was apparently under a rock. i barley found out he was ending the show.  i dont get to watch on TV because i have to get to sleep for work. but i do watch here on you tube. James has been so funny to me. i love carpool karaoke and spill your guts. the last late night show i loved was Jay Leno. So James has always stood out to me above all the current late shows. Best wishes and can't wait to see what he's doing next.
I watched your show sometimes, because I can’t stay up late all the time. But, you ARE one heck of a late night host indeed! Thank you for all the joy, laughs, and lots of things in between to us, we really appreciate that. Good luck to you and your family! Bring your talents back to UK for your people, and we for sure will continue to watch you, James! Thank you!
This was very touching, he left the show for his family.
This was one of the best late night show ever and if I'm being honest, probably my favorite one. I wish Corden could've kept hosting it, it was just so fun to watch but so happy for him and all the success he had. I hope I get to watch him in future movies/sitcoms. Have a great time at whatever you do next. I wish we had one last amazing news jingle lol
Thank you so much for all the years of joy!
Wow. Just wow. Thank you to every single person who has ever been a part of keeping this show alive. I've loved every minute of it. Dogs in Sunglasses, Celebrity Noses, Crosswalk, the News and all the jingle variations... the chats, getting to know/see more of the crew after covid, I've watched every episode and I genuinely cannot believe there aren't going to be any more. I knew it was coming and it still hurt. Goodbye, Late Late. It's been fun. Fins up forever♥
Omg. Why am I 😢
What a journey, what a ride…I take a bow 🙇‍♀️ as I fan for all the laughs, and for making me smile 😃 on those bad days, and that’s what it’s all about.  My best wishes to you and your family ❤❤
I cant believe Jimmy Fallon didn’t walk in last for the fake laughter bit. That would have been perfect!!
Thank you James I'm wiping away the tears. You have given us joy and laughter. I guess it was time to get back home to London. The best of everything to you and your family.❤
I feel like I am loosing an old friend. I'm going to miss this show so much. I share many of the feeling of the people posting here about how this was the show that helped get me through the pandemic. Thanks to ALL of you, up front and behind the scenes that made this show something truly unique.♥
Harry Styles raided Hillary Clinton's pantsuits
Wish you had used chapter headings to jump back and forth but this is what we got ❕
Love you James 😭🥺 you will be missed ❤️ Sending regards from NYC!!! Safe travels and wish you the best 😊
Thanks for the laughter and for The New! May favor continue to follow you !
God bless I hate you
Where is Conan:) We want Conan:) Please..... Don't leave out Conan:)
I bet his staff are so happy they are out of a job. Never have to deal with that wide open blowhole of his. The guy always arounds with his mouth wide open gross.
james you have made my day for years and years i started watching u when i was 7 now i’m 17 and i’m watching you flourish and become the person u are today ur amazing james. we love u
Haha watching him walk though all those people who hate him… awkward
Where was Nick??  Love you James and everyone...thank you for everything! ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Thank you James and good luck on the next chapter of you life.
I'm gonna miss the show especially the  Carpool karaoke and  The musical Crosswalks thank you James for all the entertainment that you have given us over the years🎉🎉🎉
Lol I guess Jay Leno and Conan O’Brien were too busy for this? 😅
This is the first time I've seen the show. It's pretty good! Can't wait for the next show!
I'm disappointed the show is ending can somebody tell me why I'm really not in the loop about it?
And please don’t return.
Thank you for all you do. May the future be great for you
Honestly the BEST night time host we have ever experienced:) Beyond all the others - who I also love -but James Corden you are OUTSTANDING:) we love you so very much:) Thank you for giving us so much fun and entertainment. You have a beautiful heart my friend;)
Gonna miss youse 🥹🙏🏻
Thank you James. Can't wait to see what you do next.
We’re going to miss you, James! Loved the farewell speech and song at the end. Wishing you well in your next chapter, mate! ❤️
WERE HAPPY HES GONE
That last song I cried did you?
We cannot thank you enough for creating a show that got us through the worst of times and reminded us to savor the best ones ❤ Life would not be the same without this show ❤ We wish you the best for your future endeavours and hope to see you soon ❤
In true James fashion. Going out w/ a laugh. Tearing laugh.
Thank you for helping us laugh and get through some terrible days.  I can't wait to see what you do next after a much deserved rest and quality family time.  Cheers!
James was awesome to he made people laugh in a good way never put people down. He was funny loving with alot of people that went to seen him and that was on his show. He will be miss to alot of us, and loved.
Goodbye James miss you,I loved your shows they were so funny and made me laugh it feels weird to say goodbye but all my best wishes for you James all the best luck in just life in general
Thank God it's over. Let's get some funny people back to hosting late night shows.
🙋🏽‍♀️I fkn cried
Jam he very cool I like him
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Wonderful. Now if we can get rid of Fallon and Kimmel and Colbert, the US would be a saner place. Nobody wants to watch one sided shows. Media included.  Better late than never.  ✌️
Good luck
GOOD RIDDANCE to one of the biggest douche-bag a-holes on television
R.I.P. The Late Late Show (January 9, 1995 - April 27, 2023)  This was not only James Corden's last episode, but also the last episode overall. The show is being replaced with a major network reboot of "@midnight", which originally ran on Comedy Central from 2013 to 2017!
I Will miss your singing...
Im Grateful to have met James 🙌🎉 ❤️💙💜💛 You Fam ! See you Soon! 🤪
A totally fun show so enjoyed it
I never understand why people leave great jobs, where they are valued and appreciated!
Good luck James and crew on whatever the future may hold! Thank you for the reminder of what America represents to the rest of the world. ❤
He’s probably going to have a similar show in the UK 🇬🇧
You got canceled bc you don’t know how to act in restaurants and treat people with respect. Good riddance!!
I just heard a Super Nova explode, Because that, folks,  is how a star goes
Always the correct amount of mayonnaise. You’ll be forever missed Late late with Love ♥️ Love Cordon you will be forever cherished 😢😊❤ you 🤴
We love you, James & wish you health & happiness. I'm   looking forward to seeing more shows like Mamals❤❤❤❤❤
James and team, Thank you for all the laughs. Can't wait till we see your next adventure.
Cheese at its finest, Biden lmao 🤣
I was good until the last line of that song 😭😭😭
Didn’t think this would make me so sad.. can’t believe it’s over
Wow genius skit with other late night hosts superb 👍his last guest Farrell & Styles awesome👍his speech and last song 😭I will miss James Corden 🤩on late night but I wish him and his family all the best!  It’s time for him to be where his heart ♥️ belongs! Look forward to seeing him in his future endeavors….much continued Success🍾👏👏👏👏
Nobody has a problem with the United States funding biolabs around the world but they cry over a TV show being cancelled
Come again. Be safe
I can honestly say I've never seen the show modulate light shows like Johnny Carson watch TV any on sale can't get over the fact that people actually bawling over a TV show how sad is that
Thank god it’s over❤
I will miss James Corden and The Late Late Show!!!!!!  I dearly loved Car Pool and Dearly Love James.
And… I’m crying.
Too too much screaming by the audience!!! Hurting my ears. I would turn this off except I want to see his last show. Stop screaming!!!
Last show? Will miss you James....great job!!!
I love Will's Confidence! haha He knows! Harry's The Best as well of course. WE ALL ARE A PIECE OF THE CROWN. Hurray! ❤👑
YAY ITS OVER!
I'll miss you all so much, this show made me smile in some of the most difficult times in my life and for that I'll be forever grateful. I wish you all much success and happiness in your next adventures. Love you 💜🖤
You can tell Harry wanted to say no during spill your guts, his career has been stupidly good without 1D and he knows it
How was the legendary Conan not in that bit of late night showa
I feel like this final show is a good encapsulation of why the show didn't work. It had a few good bits but I felt like the whole time I was waiting for the show to start.
Man, this comments section must be being cleaned for this raging piece of shit to have so much positive praise.
its so wild that this is actually over I've grown up with it🥲
Even the President of the United States wanted to say goodbye and best wishes to James. You deserve it all James! Thank you to you and your entire team! You will be missed!! 💐💐💐💐💐
"We are all more the same than we are different." -- James Corden. Beautiful.
im suprised biden didnt get lost during that
I've never really watched his show to late. Watched during lock down.
Glad your gone.  Good riddance.
Carpool karaoke!!! I want it!!! I’ll fight a Jimmy for it!! We love you James, God speed from back across the pond! ❤
This show is on so many drugs bro 💀🤣🤣🤣
Touching last show. Thank you everyone!
17:51 that lady just fall from a fist bump !!
Where was all this support for him when he was getting cancelled?
Finally! Good riddance.
Amazing last show. 🖤🖤🖤
Thank you, James❤. your show has brought so much joy to my life. Your talent and kindness are truly remarkable, and it's no surprise that even the President of the United States, Biden, showed up. That says a lot about you and the impact you have on people.  The song you were singing came straight from your heart, and it moved me to tears. Your authenticity and emotion shone through. We miss you!!!
He's so F.O.S
I am gonna miss this show so much. Quarantine would have been horrible without this show. Really going to miss James Corden and the teams on this show. Can't wait to see you shine in your next project.
I hate that this show has to end. James your amazing ❤
You are making the right decision.  You are putting your children 1st and that is as it should be.  Good luck to you.
What a great ending!!  We'll miss you, James, so very much.  p.s.  hey, can you possibly do Carpool Karaoke from England?  😜😍 xoxo
Rest in piss
That was amazing, President Biden. I saw James do a bit on Bold and the Beautiful. Thanks for the laughs😅
Family and children need him more kids grow go to college and U loose out. Good choice
Glad this disgusting show is over!!!
This show had so many good moments, eat or spill your guts, karpoole Karaoke,  celebrity riff off, flinch, crosswalk the musical. Definitely entertained us for years
Everything ends in this life.  Well done.
He probably didn't know the name of half of the people in the first room
Your send off last monologue should have been your first and opening before every show. Remember you played a part in the division and the fire. People with platforms should ask WHY and HOW. “ The Moment you start pretending is the moment you stop growing. Dare to be different, Be The Change that you speak of. Maybe you can surround yourself with unbiased mentors and seek wisdom on your True purpose. We all have one, be it small or large audience we are to bring people together. Will not be missed .
I can't believe his closing monologue legit moved me to tears. What an exceptional close
The way Harry just casually stole Will’s glasses on live TV. 😂
👏 😮 👏 😮 👏 😮 👏
Thanks for all the memorable laughs, tears, and unforgettable moments. We’ll miss you James!!
why am i crying over a talk show
james: they took a chance directioners: 👁️👄👁️                       no, but seriously thank you james and the entire team for making me smile and pure fantastic entertainment!! we will miss you❤️❤
I will miss this so much. Just fun and joyful chaos. (As a side not, no mention of Nick?)
Enjoy your family Broo have a happy life and thanks for the everything 😊
I can’t wait to see what you do next James! So proud of you!! 💕
So many people involved with making this show happen, unbelievable.  James, you will be missed but then again, 3rd Street will probably flow better without the Crosswalk the Musical.  :)
❤❤❤
Thank you james❤❤
Having all the late show host in one bit just made my year
🤴Corden wish you everything that makes your heart smile🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🗣💎💎💎💎💎💎💎
I think he should have sing thank you for watching the late late night show instead of thats out show
So sad. So funny. So good. Thank you James and Crew. End of an Era. We'll miss you.
Thank fuck it's over. Corden is such a bellend.
Thank you James. We already miss you!
17:51 the girl fainted 😭😭
Such a fun and original talk show. The last song made me cry. I'm gonna miss the interactions between James and the staff, and all of the other segments like Carpool, Crosswalk, and obviously all the games with the guests. Thank you, James, and the entire staff, for bringing happiness to so many people, including myself, who saw your show as a fun "escape" from the world for a few moments. Congratulations on 1200 shows, and good luck to all of you in the future!! 😭❤
CRYING
Opening to a Radiohead song may have gotten me to watch more episodes. Oh well. Enjoy retirement dude.
I watched hoping for more of a Harry 1D moment so that was disappointing.    But then I saw, the love between James and his crew, and audience, and guests through the years and thought, no, this was perfect.   It was James’ night to show gratitude and to say goodbye, to this chapter of his life. Well done , James.   I hope we get to see more of you in the future.   And maybe you’ll bring 1D around then too.  Enjoy watching your family  thrive.    Good man to put family first.
James you will never be forgotten! Thank you for 8 years of entertainment and laughter! Wishing you and your family so much love and happiness as you head back home to London.  ❤❤
Guys Harry said maybe. It’s gonna happen. Soon. 💙💚🇮🇪💛❤️
That's the way to do it.👏👏👏
funny how Harry has to dress like that due to physiological reasons.. And many famous people do this... to draw attention to themselves  for some reason.... their insecurities I guess
They All $uck not funny at all
The late night hosts getting together to show him respect & bid him farewell was everything!  Each of them bring something special to the desk, but James Corden is truly one of a kind & will be missed so much.  Thanks to YouTube we can watch our favorite bits over and over and over!! 😂😢😂
I grew up watching this show and now I’m 25 🥲 Thanks for everything James and to your entire show, especially all the laughs ❤ I wish you the best in your future endeavors. Have a safe trip back home, thanks for bringing your joy to America!
❤️😂
Man first Trevor now James Corden. I am going to miss them so much. I started watching his clips online and then realized how funny he was and started watching the show here. Used to get me through my long car rides  to work in the morning. I  am really going to miss him and his show. He did an amazing job, So unique fun and special.  What a great talent. <3
Why dump on Trump? He isn't watching and your just upsetting his followers.
its crazy cus all i hear is that james corden is the biggest asshole of all time. dont know how he still has a show
Oh, congratulations James and wishing you all the very best that you so deserve. A grand finale to a classic series ❤
did no one call Conan? LOL
I liked Craig Ferguson more
I had the privilege to be in the audience with my wife on our honeymoon 6 years ago - Shaq was a guest and I got to give him a high five as he came down through the crowd!!! I’ll never forget it. This show was amazing start to finish. Thank you for everything.
I thought to myself when all the late night hosts were in James’ dream, “I wish they had put Trevor Noah in that skit, he deserves it!” and then the masked singer reveal… I legitimately bawled for 10 minutes straight! I can’t thank all these hosts enough for getting me through Covid and every night really, the laughter they bring is immeasurable and a blessing to this planet! Thank you, James and Trevor for your loving acts of kindness to humanity. We will miss you! I ❤ you
Going to miss James!!! He’s made me laugh through some tough times
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️Thank you ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
James and the entire The Late Late Show with James Corden team, thank you for bringing years of joy and laughter into our homes.  You are a fabulous performer and have had a wonderful team supporting you.  I hope to see more of you after you are back in the UK and have spent quality time with your family.  Blessings to you, your family, and the entire The Late Late Show with James Corden team!
Going out on top!  We will MISS you.
ok anyone else already crying 10 seconds in...? ok and then laughing 30 seconds later! hahaha
Bye James. I will miss you.  😔
Wow, leave it to a British entertainer to have the worst American President in history on his final opening. The pinnacle of obscurity, this is.
Finally this restaurant karen is off our tv
Gracias James. Te vas por la puerta grande. Siempre te tendremos en nuestros recuerdos con la esperanza de que tus hijos crezcan y tal vez decidan volver. Estoy seguro que aquí tendrás un hogar y una audiencia esperándote. Te deseo lo mejor en tu próximos projecto.
Will really miss Carpool Karaoke and my favorite Crosswalk Musicals. Wishing you ALL the best going forward, James!! 💖
James Correa is the man, the myth, and a Legend!😎😭
We’re miss you James
Thanks, James, for the best carpool karaoke Paul Mc Cartney.
Laugh, cry, angry, cry, cry…. all in one show!
Would of been cooler had the real president Donald Trump left him a messsage.
The way I cried while James was singing his song🥹🥰...I made sure to stay up & watch his last episode......too funny everyone wanted carpool karaoke 🤣😂⚰️...I too don't want it to end .....is there a way we can still get that🥰...blessings on ur new journey ahead James❤
I’m going to miss this show
I smoke weed to this show 😃
You will be missed. Best of luck to you and ypur family.❤😢
Gonna miss ya, James! Thank you
I don,t know about him walking away from $6 million dollar job folks, maybe  it was rumored  not for long.
😢(((Wow))) & Bravo!!! 👏 Bravo!!! 👏👏👏 Thank you James Corden You brought much Joy to my heart.. 💜 ❤🎉❤😢😊 May God Bless you!  See you soon !  Hugs from me to you and your crew! 💞
Loved this show always!!! I’m glad James and his wife are putting their family first ❤.  Will miss you James
Thank you w the memories on making America laugh  more sad times in America   Good luck and  Tks for making the world a better place
Such a fantastic show in general and such a beautiful final show - James you are amazing and I have thoroughly enjoyed watching you over the years ❤ Props to everyone who worked on the Late Late show for your incredible work!!
The final hours in Primetime and Late Night had my Mom and I ugly crying. 😭 To be honest, after Ferguson left, I wanted a female comedian like Amy Poehler to take over. We got another white man...Then, he started the show with his parents there and all emotional. And, I was sold. Never looked back. 😊 We will miss him and the band and the crew....Thank you ALL for the joy and distraction for 8 years. Thank you to your family too, James, for moving here away from family for 8 years. We miss you, but understand why you're leaving and it makes us love you even more. Take care. ❤
Thank you guys for all the British humour and what was supposed to be American humor. Love you and am going to miss you
Good Riddance! Less trash on TV
i'm in music class watching this with my bestie-🤣😭💚💙🇮🇪❤️💛
Where was Conan?  I hope they asked him at least.
Incredible show, always fresh to end or start your day.  James Corden don’t forget your loyal fans in “America”. Good luck and cheers !!
I haven't seen every episode, but I've been here since day 1. Truly love the show, and sad to see it go!
THANK YOU, James and The Late Late Show team! I'm gonna miss this show. There's only one Late Show and it's yours, James.
Now my fellow Americans, we can do better.  We didn't treat him well in the end and now he is leaving.  Brits still have self-respect and integrity.  Something many Americans lack these days.  But,  there is always hope.  This is the best decision for him and his family.  Smart move.
Thank you for the shows! A big thank you for the carpool, the news , the guests, and most of all the gift of your time.  Thank you James!
u dont get a talk show unless you spend all your time praising liberals and calling conservatives racists.
So sweet.  Harry looking more like Jude Law every day!
Thank You James and the band and everyone!! I'm going to miss this show, good luck to everyone! James Corden WE LOVE YOU!! 😊💓🤘✌️
OMG NOOO I CANT TAKE IT 😭 😭 😭 😫
I can't believe they didn't have Craig Ferguson on 😳🤔🤔🤔
I'd say Harry's got more talent but wills funny to.
Omg Trevor showing up on the masked singer cause he also left his show 🤣🤣🤣 so good!
Good riddance!
what a fake clown
❤❤ Thank you ❤❤
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU for all the laughs, reflections, and great comedy moments.
Man Will Ferrell is just an amazing character.
❤️💚💛🫂👏🏽👏🏽THANK YOU 😊😢
Damn I’m crying now
Goodbye D-bag!
Toda esa raza para un show?
Thank you James for the last eight wonderful years.
Thank you James for all the laughter and awesome interviews. Wish you all the best on your next journey 💞 😭
Was able to go to this show before it ended 🙂
With the talk show hosts and their evil laughter I was laughing like I was on space mountain 😂💀😂.
Ummm, where was Conan in that late night host bit? Booo
Just balled my eyes out
so sad but happy for your future! you've always been my favorite of the late night hosts :) (other than Conan haha)
Thank you for stopping this show. Was wondering when it would end just glad it was sooner than later.
I am soooo sad that you're show is over, you really were a riot, & not the Jan. 6th kind, thank God 😊  Like Joe Biden said, "YOU have brought joy into all our homes", we love you & miss you already! May God continue to bless you & long live the King of late night comedy 😊 #JamesCorden
I love him…hate to see him go❤❤ he will be great at whatever he does!  He is hilarious without being disgusting!
Wow talk about a massive tear dropping 😢  I'll miss you James & crew!!
You’ve made me smile many times…laugh often….we all need that.  Don’t always agree with your political alignments but you are genuine and want only the best.  Thank you.
Thank you James you have conquered the US wishing you, your family and team success in all your future endeavours CONGRATULATIONS 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
🎉🎉🎉 🍾🍾🍾
Will Ferrell became better looking than that Hairy Lady.
growing up watching wheel of fortune with my mom is a core memory as an adult watching your show with her has been the same thank you so much james for giving me and my mom something else to bond over the years will always be a fan of yours for the rest of my life
I sobbed at the end. We will miss you all.
I will go to miss you , your good moments, you made me laugh like a crazy many time , good look with your new proyect 👏👏👏👏
His heart.
james, thank you for the crazy funny bits and for the show and being one of the best hosts in this age <33
😂😂😂😂 stars
Loved it so much!!!❤❤❤
Why??? Why cancel?
James Corden you will be missed your show and most of all you my friend and your show is by far the best late show that's ever been on television but I can also understand why you need to go home family is everything okay I've raised mine already but hey I didn't have a 8 year TV show lol love the show and you too maybe one day we can see you again and you can talk to Mila Kunis and tell her I love her too lol she's a beautiful woman anyway take care of yourself and your family man..!.. later. (Paul)
Ya know I started watching the show because of a Brit host in America? That’s unheard of and I quite frankly love the Uk so I watched. Sucks you’re leaving but happy for you and these were the best two guests you can possibly have! The Tom cruise musical was epic! Adele carpool karaoke. You went out with a bang James! Can’t wait to see what you do next.. why not take the show to London?
BYE FELICIA.
Well done, James! Go well and thanks.
why was harry there for 30 seconds nooo
I feel like James left because the U.S. has become one of the worst places to live.  He mentioned that he's seen it change over the years.  The daily mass shootings and the hateful division created by Trump are driving all of the good people out. James is just a humble man who is authentically himself. He set out to make people laugh and he met his goal. As you fly away to the UK, know that you left a wonderful legacy of memories in the U.S.  What a great song you sang in the finale!  We will miss you!  You did good!
So funny 😂❤
Please don’t leave James.. you have given all of us so much joy even when all of us didn’t have much joy.  You and your whole staff will never be forgotten.  Love you all so much again I am so sad
I will miss your show James,  and what you said about All of us and America was  beautifully said ❤  I wish you and your family all the best.
Good vibes
What an incredible last show! Ive always loved that he was the musical theatre late night guy since I’m obsessed with musicals.
Finally, the world can heal now (they’re probably gonna delete this comment)
Best Wishes. Hate to see an ally go. Thanks for all the laughs.
*God bless and keep you and your family, James. All you and the Late Late Show crew have done, from Day 1, is to pour positivity, joy and love into a world that desperately needed it. Thank you for EVERYTHING!!!!* 🥰🤗🥰🤗🥰🤗🥰
everyone that brings such joy and love in the world deserves to be remembered like one of our best friend and one of our family, this you are, and all the people made and in the show among the years.Thanks for everything.........we will keep in touch and maybe one day we will see you all again on those shores. for a new adventure in the late night...have a great life, what a wonderfull world.
why it feels like a void on my stomach? thanks James for the ride, it was one for the books.
glad you are gone never do anything again please
Damn, I cried through carpool karaoke!
❤❤❤ I really enjoyed watching James. We'll miss you
Congrats on destroying a legacy
Bon Voyage! Family matters.
Great last show
You know if the show (The Late Late Show) had to end. It ended with a great host in James. He transformed the show and was very fun see to night after night. Good luck James in whatever you do next. Love ya since The Lodger
Harry calling himself "a flash in the pan" took me out lol
i love this show sm, thanks for everything James and the Late Late team!!
They gave Harry the fish milkshake since he’s a pescatarian 🥺🥺
I still miss Benny Hill and now this.
wouldn't it be funny if this turns out to be the biggest Click-Bait of the century and the new season starts the very next night? 😂
I wish him well, but feel bad for all the restaurant servers wherever he ends up. Dude is the worst human being off camera.
this broke me seeing james that sad i was waiting for it all night and that final song was just crushing. i really hope he does something maybe similuar back home and we can tune in. im sure he could get a show over there based on the views here.
Brilliant… absolutely brilliant…. Carry on lad, won’t be the same without you love. ❤
James, thank you for your contribution to my life!
Thanks for the laughs and it's crazy to imagine that this show is gone.
Congratulations James for the 8 years of late night shows thanks for all the laughs you’ve given us I loved the carpool karaoke best of luck back home in London we love you!
Big impact! Thanks for showing the country how to get along and not be at war.  I discovered James on you tube during covid.  You tube and covid did a lot for late night television. More song and dance everyone!
Douche needed to go.
something tells me Joe Biden relied on this show for all of his news.
no matter what my political view is that Biden skit was pretty funny lmao
It's been real comments section friends who've been here since the covid casual hangouts the crew did! We've commented so much, laughed so much, and now it is at an end. Safe trip back home, James!
One of many of his best was when he was carpooling with 1 of the  X First Ladies. THANK you sir. B SAFE
Why harry
Couldn't be happier. All these woke late night sh!t shows are worth skipping. Though there will be a replacement who is at least as cringe worthy.
I’m gonna miss this show so much 💔
Thank you James, Ian, Rob, Ben, Lauren, Nick, Steve, Reggie, Tim, Hagar, Guillermo, Susan, Scotty, Pete, Winnie & everyone of the crew of The Late Late Show! We will miss you all! Blessings going forward. ❤🙏🏻
I’m so ready to get a tattoo of James’s face on my ass 🥲 I’m going to miss him so much. #sobbing
Are they like deleting the bad comments or something? How is it that there are over 2,400 comments on this and none of them are discussing how he is absolute scum of the earth?
Standing ovation with tears streaming. 😢Missing you already. ❤
Good riddance!
I’m gonna miss you James ! Ever since you started you became my favorite! You and Fallon. Forever in our hearts. Love ya pal. Best wishes wherever you go next . Well be waiting to see what it is! Unless, of course you don’t want to do anything which is well in your right! Have fun! Whatever that may be .❤️
Thank god it's gone, I was wondering when this garbage was going bye-bye, let alone he had the guts to crap on Tucker meanwhile his trash is getting cancelled lol
thank you for finally going off the air, I hope Jimmy, Colbert follow suit, nothing but garbage on these late night shows.
DAMN YOU James for making me cry. Sorry to say that I’ve never watched a single episode and now I’m sad 😢. Guess I’ll be binge watching all eight years
Like other late night shows; James got caught up in endless negative political commentary. I understand, because I understand where CBS is on the political spectrum, and James seems to agree. Late Night shows spewing sometimes hateful commentary has nearly destroyed them all. We stopped watching The Late, Late show years ago, as I’m sure others have as well. 20 minutes of Trump bashing night after night. Even the tonight show is on the rocks due to political commentary many just don’t want to hear. Love James Cordon, but if you join the political hate heard, may the shows fail where they lay.
Wow, Thank you all!  Such a great run.  I'll miss this.
Omg James, I just realized who You remind  Me of, Chris Farley.  You totally get into character just like he  did. ❤🙋🏻‍♀️
Why is nobody talking about the girl falling down at 17:50 after Harry fist bumps her?? 🤣
It's a weird feeling crying and laughing at the same time. Love you James Corden. You have been amazing to watch for these years. I will miss you and everyone in the show so much. I am so emotional because the show was part of my nighttime routine. Wow. We will miss you so much.
Life is not going to be the same, first Trevor Noah and now James Cordon……good bye James and thank you for all the laughters! Nobody will be able to top your carpool karaoke and traffic lights skits! Wish you and your family well and all the best to your next venture ❤
I absolutely loved watching your show and you will be most definitely missed by so many people, god bless you and your family forever 🙏❤️💯
HAAAARRRRRYYYYYY😍🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
my heart omg
Harry, you did amazing honey 💕
The girl who fist-pumped Harry Styles immediately fainted, Did you guys see that?!
Thank you James for all the laughs and songs! It's been great!
that sound fun!
Nice Radiohead opener!
Where the hell Is Tom Cruise! Not even a video message? 😳
Thank god its over
Thank you James and the late late show…. I’m gonna go cry now 😢 Darling, I wish you, your family, and everyone who worked on the show the best of luck and tons of happiness on your new journeys.
thank god this trash is off air
You be sure to come back and visit now, ya hear? 💝
Really thought they were going to have an epic news theme
That’s definitely a deep fake of Biden. He can’t keep his eyes open for that long 😂
Thank you James and the whole Late Late Show family for welcoming each viewer into your family. Thank you for being the light that has guided us through such dark times. Thank you for transforming Late Night television with one of the most dynamic and creative formulas in late night television history.   The love and support that so many have shown you in these last shows speaks to the incredibly wonderful and positive impact that you have made in their lives and careers.
I'm not crying you're crying😭
anyone else think the video of Biden was CGI?
they're cheering knowing damn well theyre going to be unemployed
Will miss you, favorite late night show ever. ❤
why am i crying   🥲
Wish we got to see Nick and Ben and Rob Crabbe on this here last show tbh
WILLS JOKE 22.03 ⚰️⚰️
What a class act. Will miss you
So why did the show end? He just decide to retire or something?
You have made me laugh night after night, YOU ARE THE BEST ❤
Wait, you lost me at sleepy Joe
honestly i never comment on anything....but I will miss you so much, the warm way you talk to guests, all the skits OUTSIDE of the studio which other late nite hosts rarely, or never do...and just a note your role in Mammals blew me away...I will miss you on an everynite basis...but I look forward to anything you do next...lifetime fan
This video is not available in India 😢 Why?
I’m not crying, you’re crying! I’m gonna miss you James!!
Lol. This is the one and only time I ever watched his show. It’s ok.
Did they really waste 5 mins on a door slap shit comedy? Too long
Thank you James for always being a light during the darkest times of my life. This show never failed to bring me out of that darkness and put a smile on my face
Now time for Harry Styles to takeover! He did great as guest host!
The opening was brilliant!!
This show has always brought a smile to my face and so many laughs. I'm going to miss you, James. I'm going to miss the whole team of lovely people (Reggie & the band, Louis, Winnie, Ian, all of you)! I wish you well in everything else you do. xoxox
I’ll forever miss you! thank you so much james! you will be missed !!!
Just want to say THANK YOU!
Damn. Love him or hate him, this is the end of an era innit 🥲 Thanks for all the memories James and Ben
Please keep this man off of TV and movies. He's horrible, as a human being and actor. He's lucky it lasted this long.
You are truly one of the best humans on this planet! I wish you blessings upon blessings in your next chapter in life and for all the days of your life. Thank you for all of the laughs and smiles. Love you James Corden!😘
James big hugs I’m from England too how can I keep in contact with you on the next part of your journey. Gavin n Stacey all day 🤣🤣🤣👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽⭐️🌟🥇🎬👑
Awe James you will be missed. I was with you and the artist in your sing along in the car.  The street theater you had on Beverly and Genesses.   And the things you and Tom Cruise did.  You name it.  But you will be back.  I know you will.   Sending blessings your way and your family.   Tight hug
38:44 The final Curtain Call. What a glorious way to close the show and exit. Beautiful! I cried at that ending. ❤
Thank you James we love you and miss you 💋🌺🙏
i was laughing the whole time 😭😭 thank you so much james ♥️♥️
👏👏👏👏Good bye 😢
My first comment on the final show! Thanks James for bringing 8 years of smiles. You've been so amazing, best of luck in your next chapter
My hopes is over one direction will never comeback together
The other late night show cameos was awesome.  Dave !!!!
Ok but if they actually do give someone carpool karaoke we all k ow jimmy fallon should get it
I’m Not crying 🥹Gonna Miss Late Late
I only watch on YouTube, but I am faithful about it. You are kind and funny and so talented, great singer and dancer!
Thank you James for your show every night, we will miss you so so much.❤
Sir, Thank U for all the laughter. It's been a pleasure to watch you. Thank U for sharing your Family with US. I will personally miss you. May God guide on your new journey.🙏😢
Good-Bye, Adios..don't let the door hit your fat rump on the way out
GODSPEED MY MAN!!! Been so great watching you!!! So when are you coming out with YPUR OWN SHOW? ❤❤❤🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼💪🏽👍🏼 Wish you the best Sir
Why am I crying 😢
Not sure how I can live without him!
Thanks for the singing in the car bits. Wonderful
What a difference leaving a show with your head up with such loving and caring from everybody. And the contrast of another (news) host leaving in disgrace with his tail between the legs and nobody cares. Huge difference between uniting and dividing. Law of life, reap what you sow…
Missed opportunity or they just couldn’t get him but they should have had Craig Ferguson come out when James woke up lol that would have been a killer! I wounded who will be the next late late night host? 🤔 James was a good one! Craig was my favorite. But amazing job none the less.
As always what a show!!! I am going to miss all the shenanigans of the Late Late Show! ❤
James...We will seriously seriously miss you. Best Wishes!!!  BTW...We all have had issues with key coded doors.
Thank you James, you will be sorely missed!💔😨🙌🏾
Sophia richie PR. Realtime is what the people want.
You were and are a blessing and a gift to America. We will greatly miss you, James. Godspeed.
Very nice show . Very best in your knew endeavors. I would mist you . Everyone, still is nice you are going home and enjoy your parents , your country.
boring last show! I guess they couldnt make it great otherwise Colbert would look bad as a replacement
I will miss you James but wish you and your family the best. Good luck and whatever you choose next I’m sure it will be awesome and fun
This is harder than I thought it would be.... I'm gonna miss James like Jon Stewart Conan & Craig as much and will always remember this shows absurd hilarity. Thanks for the years of laughter.
James made the Late Late show his own…❤️❤️ he is going to be very missed in this time slot, never be another like him!! 🥰🥰❤️❤️❤️ he is so fun!! Can’t wait o see what the future holds for him!
Not me bawling my eyes out before eating breakfast. What an ending to an amazing era. Thank you James and crew for countless memories and laughter. You will be missed in our homes. Happy Trails. ❤
Wow James. What will you do now? There isn’t a HUGE success rate in the movie industry. You’re locked out man! Is that a glimpse into the future? Hope not! Hope you’ve saved your pennies! I have truly enjoyed your show:) Thanks especially for Carpool Karaoke. I have had SO MUCH ENJOYMENT for Carpool Karaoke!!! Godspeed!🙏👍
Thanks for everything James!  We bid you a fond farewell!
James, you got a fuckton of hate in recent years, but let's be honest. You were a true source of joy with all the cool things you've done and exposed us to with the whole Carpool Karaoke stuff and everything else you've done. One of the only Late Night shows that brought the crew on as main characters, and it's been incredible to watch how good of a host and boss you've been. Congrats to Ben as well for putting on his excellent show this last decade+.
Everyone acting like he doesn’t treat people like shit.
Best of luck James to your journey and thank you for a funny and fun 8 years!! Thanks to everyone part of the show and best of luck to you as well! We going to miss you
Thank you, James and your team for sharing your joy and amazing gifts with us. I don't have TV per se, but have followed you on YouTube and will surely miss you. All the best in London and whatever comes next.
Nooooo!!!! James cordon is the best late night show host these days, none of the other ones even come close... Jimmy Fallon is second best
Damn had to turn it off at Biden what’s shit way to go out
James I’m Guilty.. why do I only want what I can’t have?? I never watched.. because Zzzzz until I found Uhu on line  & now I’m obsessed 😂Aloha  Luv C 🫶🏼⚡️🔥⚡️🏄‍♀️👁️❤💚💛🗽🇱🇷🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
I hope Craig Ferguson takes back over.
So long James good luck on your adventures
all i see is people saying thanks, i think we are all so happy its finaly over
I'm not cutting onions.... Your cutting onions...💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗
RH gave permission to use their song?
Aunt Cassie if you see this text me 😢
thank god its over omg,
I thought people hate him. Glad it was a positive end.
Noooo. But why. Please don't end.  😢
What a wonderful journey❤
Even I cried when he was playing the piano how can you not be emotional this gave TV something original
Our torment has ended
It would have been funnier if the cameraman had the door passcode, but would only give it if James knew his name
thank god
As he ages Will looks more and more like Alex Trabeck
Thanks buddy you guys help me so much.
17:51 THE GIRL FAINTED
I stayed up till 4 am waiting for this, if i had just waited 30 more minutes! 😂
Why am I literally crying right now
We love you James! We’ve laughed with you and cried with you! Thank you to you and your entire staff. We will be seeing you love. ❤
"We are all the same..." Amen James. You now have more time to Get closer to the Creator of EVERYTHING and to get to know Christ better. Make sure your family is covered by The Most High❤ See ya around...according to your choices...
Justice to for Steve and the news jingle
25:26 me when there was no 1D reunion
🎉cheers and so many 😿 tears! I've adored sering the danger & silliness of seeing fancy actor/actresses risk their lives for Sidewalk theater! Learning CK was filmed on a trailer for celeb safety, should've known, still, a brilliant concept! Bless those 8 years, intellect & sass, 💋 kiss of too the UK. Its like SNL losing a season of cast geniuses & also Lorne Michaels. It was time to go. U did it right!
Glad Biden took time from eating ice cream and letting the country burn down to say congrats to this liberal beta 😂  priorities of the Biden administration
🥲🥲🥲
Ok.. my first and last time watching canned laughter.  A whole 10 minutes.  Terrible.
class act and you'll be missed!    You are truly one of a kind    Good luck on your next chapter ❤
You were part of my laughter therapy before bed..thank you SO much..and all the best to you and your family
Why is harry wearing a baby poo suit lol
Damn I can't believe it's over =(
Im going to miss that band. Maybe the greatest anti-band in the history of late night television 🎸 🖖🫡
What an absolute legend James Cordon is ❤
Late night talk show hosts bit was great. I was really hoping Conan was going to pop in.
Just outstanding. Thank you, James and crew!!!!!
The Door scene?  I didnt laugh. Waste of time. 🥱
I missed Johnny, Dave, Conan.. like family members moving far away.  But James didn't die.  He will still be around in some form or fashion.  And never say never about his talk show resuming down the road.  Retirement can be overrated & boring.
I still miss Craig Ferguson.
Why????
The door will always be open, The cheers from the crowd and the crew, Don't go too far dear Mr. Corden, We are all clapping for you.   May your time back home be a blessing, And your family gets time with you too. In England with laughs you'll be caressing, The ten Emmys and Tony we gave you.  So, James we'll all be waiting, One day for you to return. Until then, we'll continue our hating, Of each other and let Amerika burn.
Ian looks like he was a good waiter
I cried 😢 seriously one of the best shows of all time!!!
James Corden is a GOAT, wonderful entertainer and a decent human being. What a great show, a great team. With gratitude.
Biden is such a Sweetheart!  It was also nice of Colbert, Fallon, Meyers, Noah, Kimmel, and Letterman to honor him.
goodbye you brat.
Such an amazing show
Wow , Wonder whats your next move??
We will miss you and always have a special part in our hearts always James ❤❤❤
Thankfully this is the last. James Corden SUCKS ! ! !
Mr. Cordon, thank you for your wonderful talent, which you have shared on your Late Late Show for the past 8 years. You will be enormously missed. I have loved watching your shows and now feel a huge void. I wish you all the best and every blessing as you return to your homeland and reunite with friends and family. May your next venture be as successful as this one was. ❤❤❤❤❤❤
After reading his interview in daily mail … how he put down America!! You had no problem with this country making you a millionaire several times over … so don’t let the door hit you on the way out…. Don’t come back
I will miss you so much…..💔💔💔
😭😭 no words   The bit with all the late night host was genius. So happy Harry and Will were the last guest. I’m going to miss car pool Karaoke so much. ❤
One of THE BEST of All Time... Quality of Host, Band, Writers, Producers, Camera Crew, Guests! LEGENDARY!!! WISHING YOUR NEXT CHAPTERS TO BE EPIC ONES!!!
Why is his show ending? Is he choosing to end it? I didnt realize he was on 8 years i never watched him on tv just when he did carpools
Thank you James for bringing so much joy into our lives. We will miss you and good luck in your future endeavors ❤
At 10:56 I just started balling! I miss them all some much! Wish those 4 boys came too 😢but maybe soon……
Humans...
Good riddance
God Speed James!!!    Your show will be dearly missed!!!!
I'm only 13 my life can't end now!😭
Let’s go Brandon
Thanks James everyone will remember this hope to see the comes for you in the future
Fantastic final show, presented with class, especially the send-off song! I saw the 9pm show, but I couldn't stay up for this hour. Im so grateful that the whole thing is on YouTube! It is not a repeated video of the earlier show, but a whole new, fun version❣️  We will miss you and your entire creative crew, but i get it. You needed to go home. Kids, family, and friends are getting older. Time with them is precious.  Now we will all be watching what you will be going to do from "across-the-pond!" We are still with you, with love!😢❤❤❤
Wow. A shout out from the President of the United States. Congratulations 🎈🎊🎉
Love you James. America will really miss you!
Thanks for posting this on here
🙏🙏🙏💖💖💖💯💯💯👏👏👏😪💔Best wishes to you, James!!💖
Definitely an AI Biden video! There is no chance he could put that many words together, let alone remember that James Corden was ever at the White House! 🤣
1 down   4 to go
That was kind of rude what he said to his mom but whatever
Any idiot that thinks James is not a talented singer, performer and comedian just ate their words! Very well put together ending. Thank you for the laughs James and the entire team!
I still can't believe it's over 😢
He's not even genuinely shaking his teams hands! And did he almost grab a team members boob!!?!?!?
I dont understand why Conan doesnt get a show, hes the funnyest of all, Kimel is good, Corden is fine, but the rest are so boring
Thank you James, you been my favorite show and wishing you the best in England.
You have done an amazing job James corden & so sad to see you go but i wish you & your family joy, happiness & to new adventures!!
Why didn't Steve make a jingle "jingle".
Thank you to whoever had the sense to end this garbage.
Thank you James and team for so many amazing moments! You will be missed!
10:55 STOP IT DONT
Thank you, James!! God bless ❤🙏
Great run James, we'll miss you! Thanks for the laughs❤
Crap show and host…good riddance
Too bad Tom Snyder has passed away. He was the original host, and the best, imo.
Good riddance my friend! Start treating people more nicely :)
Miss You Already! Thanks for the most fun and upbeat shows James & Crew!❤❤
James, you made me laugh so much throughout the years. Talk shows will really really miss the authenticity and spunk you had!
F this dude
We miss you!!
Living in South Africa, this was the one show that I wish I got to watch live. It was the least political and often pushed back on both sides of the political isle, and although the show was more left leaning, it’s still was far more balanced the the likes of the other night shows which serious need to take a page from James and do comedy again instead of marginalising people who don’t agree with each other politically.  There was a lot of bad press around James Corden and although I imagine that he was not the nice person that he may make himself out to be, he was phenomenal as a host and his comedic timing was excellent and more so, he is human and entitled to have bad days, like we all do at times.  Carpool Karaoke and Spill Your Guts were amongst the best comedy bits introduced to late night comedy.  In 2015 to 2016, I thorough enjoyed all the late night shows and then they became SO political and I couldn’t even tolerate Trevor Noah, who came from South Africa! James was the only late show that I would watch clips from  An end of an era!
I love the late late show and James you will be missed ❤️
thank fuck
Thank you to all of the crew, the guests, and to you James for making me smile, laugh, cry, and even pee just a little bit.
thank you!!
I will miss my late nights! Good luck James whatever you do next! Thanks for all the laughs!
life sucks until we laugh, thanks james
This show started right around the time I got divorced. My life was a mess, I had two sad, scared kids that were now completely my responsibility, and I was really struggling to find joy. And for a long time, every morning started with making smoothies with my son, while we watched clips of carpool karaoke and crosswalk the musical. It still sticks out to me as some of my favorite moments from his childhood. It was a way to start our days with joy and laughter at a time when life was really hard. And I just want to thank everyone at the Late Late Show for sending joy out into the world. It’s more important and more impactful than you know.
A FULL EPISODE 🥹
Sucks that this show is over! I liked it. Just like the Fallon and Kimmel shows. Best wishes to Corden and his family. Hopefully, he will be back some time in the future.
They missed the opportunity to have conan in that bit.
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭THANK YOU !!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Bye Felicia!!!
Time to come home and get another Gavin and Stacey in the bag!
We will miss you, James!
Im a Kimmel and a Colbert fan, to the writers though, this is one of the best late night skits ever!
now if we could just get our boy Craig back
Reggie is so boring and at least well never see him again
James is the worst. Good Riddance.
Amazing 😢! Going to miss this show fr fr!!!!
Fu*king sobbing. Going to miss the show so much. Ty!! 🥹👏♥
crap it just started and i’m already shaking
He showed us elegance in the end. Filled us for years with laughter in some of the hardest times. Taught us to be less serious & embrace life. His amazing team helped bring the best shows to life. Your all brilliant & will go on to do amazing things. He ended his last show filled with gratitude & Grace & that was beautiful to see! Thank you for making us smile ❤ I have a strong feeling it won’t be the last time… just for now 🥂😁
Why is this being geo-blocked AFTER it was uploaded? LOL
All them people praising one jerk lol wow
Harry Styles I love you so much.💕
we’re just some funny boys…. who like to spread some joy!!!
Welcome to the final show, bye James Corden You will be missed thank you for changing my life with your show you brought happiness in my life with all the members One Direction.❤
I’m really gonna miss the late late show it was my favorite
Thank you James.  Thanks for the love.
I love them all, but it points out how white men dominate this segment of tv.
I am so very sorry to see this show come to an end!!! James is the best, he will be missed. Thank you for entertaining us!!
So many viral skits and clips over the years! Thank you for all the laughs
It has been a great ride. Thanks everyone.  Tell James when his kids fly the nest he can come back. We will wait. Lots of love.
Your speech about how America has evolved in 8 years and we as humans have mire similarities than differences was EPIC ....THANK YOU SIR!!
Gosh were gonna miss you bud!!!
Did anyone notice at 17:48 a girl fainted?
I watched ur first and now ur last with tears in my eyes. Thanks for making a huge difference in my life! U and ur family and ur friends and your team and Winnie rocks! James u are a good!
James were going to miss you. I saw the Howard Stern interview. Go home to be with your family. Most of us would love to have an opportunity to make the decision of family over money.
Well done!
All just for tv he is a  a ss when the camera not rolling...
There’s so many memories I have with this show, Thank You James so much for all the laughs you’ve brought! Thanks to the crew as well!!
Thanks for all the great entertainment for last 8 years but you deserve some happiness and to go back home and be with family! You will be missed
The final song had me like 😩😭
Any wish from a incompacitated old pedophile is defintely more of a dig than a step up
Cheers
That dream bit was some amazing respect. Every current late night host and more came out for James. And keep in mind, Colbert, Meyers, and Fallon had to come from NYC to do it.
I’m balling my eyes out 😢 thank you James for all the laughs you gave us through the years ❤ God bless
This is a nice show. I should start watching it.
We Know James is a spoiled star. He rages at his crew and doesn't tip waiters
LATER JAMES!!!! 💯💥💯❤‍🔥
This was my favorite show ever, I am gonna miss it like a crazy, couldn’t watch without tears 😢.  Thank you James and can’t wait what’s next ❤
So much love
😂I’ll miss you
12:24 That bit with the other talk show hosts was brilliant! Glad this last episode ended with a song. Best wishes to all the cast and crew!👏❤🍀
What a beautiful message and reminder he delivered on what the USA represents to the rest of the world.
The best ever late late show with the best person ever I will miss you forever ❤❤❤
The girl who passed out after fist bumping harry at 17:50
Give us the Harry Grammy clip
Missed opportunity to make the title “Welcome to the final show”
Won’t be the same without you!!! ❤
lol the bit with all the other hosts was probably the second funniest thing on this show. carpool karaoke is the funniest!
Uh oh.. watch out.. white male ragefully breaking shit. But he is a Hollywood LIb.. so that is okay...
Thank you for all the fun times you have given me, it is something I will never forget. 😂 we love u James
bye felisha
Thanks for enjoyable nights. I wished I was able to see it live. Thanks to you, the band, and crew. I'll miss it.  I hope Pluto TV will make a channel of your show one day.
Gonna miss ur show buddy!
Interesting. Will Ferrell was also a guest on the final episode of The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien a long time ago.
He totally missed a joke when he said it was 3 in the morning you should have said this is the time that I usually watch you sleep
Awww.... Good Job! It was a Good show! Great ideas! But, the time slot kinda sucked. It kinda dragged, at times but, I think his style, talent and energy is a bit too big for a stifling "talk show" format. Especially late late night comedy.. I  hope he finds his own groove, a new kind of shtick and has a ton more success!💫
I LOVED His clean nails 💅😍 HS made my day with not putting polish
I was a huge fan of Corden until I started hearing rumors of him being a mean person off cameras. Then the rumors became true. Lots of people have come out saying he’s not a nice person. Only nice to celebrities who are super rich or famous. Very sad😢. Go back to London and stay there!!!! 😡
Thank you, James and the the entire crew. All the best to all! I cried with this.
Corden and Noah on the masked singer HILARIOUS!!!
thx for all the laughs, james and everyone involved 😢
Love you James!!!!... Thanks for the laughs!!!...  I'll be watching reruns!!!!!🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡
James are you feeling optimistic or you just loving this to be a national anthem or something. Jimmy can tell you that Jesus Christ knows everything. Ask Jesus Christ yourself. The Holy Spirit with Saint Michael expect you too. Blasphemy is blasphemy. In Jesus Christs name we pray amen.
I’m going to miss this show!❤ Best of luck to James and his crew❤
James, you made the day of many people not only in the US! You are the best talk show host I've ever seen, I'm a huuuge fan and wish you all the happiness and success ❤ love from Brazil
Thank you for everything.  Truly a bright spot in the world of TV.  Thank you for your pandemic shows, Reggie, Ian, STEVE!!! (Love the News flourishes), Haga, Nick, Guillermo, Tim, James.    Thank you.  Also, thank you to CBS for posting the full show on YouTube.    Have wonderful lives, filled with love, happiness and good health.  Thank you.
It's pretty wild that Will Farrell was also on Conan's last Tonight Show
I just now realised that I have never seen the show from start to finish. A couple of days ago I read somewhere that the idea of the show was to have something to stream throughout the day. This was what you succeded in doing. I have enjoyed the way your show celebrated the theater, song and dance the way it did.
Just hit 18:03 😁 i know you want to!
Ps: love you harry
I’m crying watching and trying to do my makeup for work!
Thank you for making the YouTube version of the show 1 video. Also, this last show was so elegantly funny (no silly funny) from the beginning to the end. Thank you to the whole crew for 8 wonderful years of laugh, cries and "The News". Good luck to you all in your next adventures.
this is the first time Im finishing the episode with a sad frown on my face. Usually, I'd be dying of laughter or end with a content smile.
Goodbye james corden and we'll see you again
I’m just sobbing. Really, I wasn’t prepared to say goodbye.  James; this whole show has been my safe space ever since 2015. As a viewer since the very beginning, it feels weird saying goodbye. This show brought me through the easy last years of my teens and the difficult parts of my adulthood: my Grandparents deaths with cancer in 2017, Covid{obviously} the Trump Show[another obvious one} and now my college life where I’ll be a future journalist. The skits made me laugh out loud after hard days.  Carpool Karaoke made me want to get in the car with your guests and just roll the windows. Your musical parodies made me laugh.  Also: as an almost 10 year fan of k-pop, thank you for having groups like BTS, BP, TXT, etc on and introducing the world to them and making them comfortable. It really made me happy.  Reggie and the Band, Nick Bernstein, Pete,Ian, Lauren, the writers, etc; thank you for becoming like family to us along with James. It feels like we are truly losing something special.  Finally to the people over at CBS: thank you for taking a chance on James. It has made our late nights better and happier and we’re gonna miss it. I’ll just say this;  Congratulations on your bit of success We can’t wait to see what you do next.   Thank you for 8 years of Joy, James.  P.S who knows; maybe when the kids get older, you could comeback and try your hand at daytime.  P.P.S: Paramount Plus; Please put the remaining seasons on your streaming site so we can binge in case we miss James.  ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I just cannot believe a show such as this was taken off! It is such a great show and talent!
Well miss you james corden
Thank you all, you made my life better and the world even better. It just feels like this was the last day of my life as I know it, just thinking that I will never feel the feling of opening my YouTube and having a video of the Late Late show hurts. Thank you for everything.❤❤❤
James, Ian, Lauren, Rob, Ben, Nick, Reggie, Steve, Tim, Guillermo, Hagar, Winnie, Susan, Pete, Scotty, every other person on the crew of The Late, Late Show … thank you so much for the joy that you gave to so many people during the pandemic. When things were strange and you didn’t even have an audience, you became the “cast” of a show that I enjoyed tuning in for each and every day. You will be missed so much.
Thank you every single one of you for bringing much joy to our lives for past 8 years❤❤we really appreciate you❤
Why did the show end?
😢😢😢😢❤❤❤❤
Isn’t this the guy who’s completely rude outside of the show? The guy is as fake as they come and people on here are still saying they’re gonna miss him smh 🤖
Thank you so much for everything you have done I’ll miss this so much
Why is the show ending?
We gonna miss u bro💪🏾🙏🏾
wow, they rebuilt that desk incredibly quickly
Good ending. I love Will. Harry just adds to the sexy of the show. Going to miss James sweet goofy self. I love the late night host skit, they need to hang more often. High key I hope it's a female the next show.
You done us proud 👏 in the UK. WELCOME HOME❤
I love, Harry! Good luck, James!
Will dearly miss this show.
💜💜💜🤟🏼✌🏼🤙🏼🙏🏼🎶🎶🎶💜💜💜
This show has been a bright light everyday❤ thank you!!
😮🎉🎉WOW!!!!! GREAT EPISODE😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Thank u James and crew you’re all amazingly talented, very rarely do I tear up watching TV. U all moved me and just grateful I watched this 😢
Farewell....👋🏿👋🏿👋🏿
Having the other Talk Show hosts was AWESOME!!! Beautiful closing song ..🥰 Best of luck James !!! and looking forward to your next chapter!!!!!
Thank you so much❤
All those people no longer have jobs.
Thanks for the laughs
Knowing how big of a prick he is, glad to see him go forever.
😢Beautiful justbeautiful!
Thank you James! All the fun moments and great shows you've had. I'll always remember The Late Late Show with James Corden. ♥
Fantastic job James! Thank you for the laughs and memories!
omg I'm devastated but I wish him the best - and I know he will have it
this is the end of an era, thank you James and all the crew for these amazing moments. Thanks for posting everything on YouTube as you have a lot of non-american fans watching you! We will miss you a lot. Wishing y'all all the best. <3
Thank you James you done a wonderful job you will be greatly missed good luck on your new endeavours ❤
Almost a decade ago, I made the same decision to go back home from where I was living. 10 years later, still the best decision I made. When your heart tells you it’s time, listen. James, good luck going back home! I hope you make an appearance on Doctor Who ❤
In 2020, I left my job of 12 years that had become unsustainably stressful, but I did have a wonderful group to work with who made the decision to leave very hard. That summer as I began a new job working from home, I started watching the show online. The banter between the crew on the show quickly became my stand-in for that close group of friends at work. For the last three years I have looked forward to new videos being posted each morning. Thank you to the whole Late Late Team for the last three years, even though we'll never meet, I feel like we're old friends. I wish you all the best.
Genuinely this show holds such a special place in my heart❤️thank you for everything James, for all the laughs and all the good times!
Thank you James corden , that was a hell of an episode. Your show is going to be my all time favorite. I saw how painful that was for you, but unfortunately part of the journey is the end
Miss you already.  Best wishes to you, family and Late Late show team/crew 😢❤️🙏🏼
Bon Voyage James.  We will miss you.  I am happy for you that you and your family are going home.  Don't be a stranger.  Much love & gratitude from MD.
the girl falling when harry fist bumped her is so real
IM CRYING I DONT WANT IT TO ENDD
thank you so so much James for the awesome entertainment you have given us. thank you for all of the laughs and smiles. i will truly miss it so much. you are a legend :')
thank you james cordon and staff for this wonderfull show.
Thank you so much James, Ian, Reggie, Pete, The band, All the cast and Crew, The producers, The Wrighters, EVERYONE!!! I’m gonna miss this show so much. It has brought me and others so much joy over all the years! I wish James and everyone the best! We will miss you and we love you all! ❤️
It sucks he is leaving
That aint no dream n thank u funny man
and that's the end :)
l'll miss the carpool karaoke so much and definitely miss you and Harry styles conversations
Ohhhhh, First Trevor Noah, now you James……. I guess the networks don’t want truth through comedy.
❤❤❤❤❤❤
LMAO I thought Will was just riffing off of Reggie's nonsense, but I googled it - HO and N are both legitimate scales of model railroading 🫠💀
I honestly will miss this show. I actually really like'd James Corden, it took my a little while to start really watching it but he actually was funny a lot of the time. How sad he's gone.
I can't stop crying😭 Thank you James and the entire crew✨ah i miss this show already🥲sending love and hugs to you all!!❣
Thank you all for making this happen over 8 years!! Time for a new adventure!
bring back craig
Harry styles dateng cuman jadi bahan clickbait doang 😅
I'll miss this show so much.
This a skit but read between the lines
We're gonna miss you mister!  God Bless you!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
31:36
DAMN!!!!! I was never a REGULAR viewer of the show, but had to watch this one because I knew he would make a great exit... but DAMN... that was the most heart-felt, sincere goodbye I believe I have ever seen!!! It made my eyes sweat a little bit.   James, thanks for the levity that we all need, and reminding us how much we're all the same rather than how different we are.   Good luck to you and your family!!!
I have never seen a whole episode before, always just bits, sketches, etc. All of those transitions to next segments is an ad? Becuase some of them are like 5 minutes so it feels wrong if they are, somebody lmk please
I've been watching the show almost since the beginning, huge fan. I'm so thankful for all the laughs and the company. Thank you all and good luck. I'll miss you. You won't be forgotten. Wish you all the best. Un abrazo, from Spain
Apparently one of the biggest two faces in Hollywood. Every behind the scenes article written about him outlines how big of an A hole he his to his audience and coworkers
much love from Sri Lanka 🇱🇰
Love him so f*ing much 😭😭😭😭
Well done, James, band and crew. You delivered and then some. Hold your heads high, God bless and good luck in future endeavors.
<3
I cried so hard and sobbed my eyes out while watching this, as I’m sure many others did too. Thank you so much, James, for everything. I love you, buddy, so much.
Can't wait to see James shine in the UK ,James is coming home 🎉🎉🎉🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
Too bad they chose to end it with a fake thing. James pretending to play piano. Very tasteless in my humble opinion. I mean he knows how to sing, why did he have to also pretend in front of all that audience?
Class, hilarious, sweet natured and wildly creative! You will be missed, James Corden and YOU are a light! Thank you! ❤
best final show ever by a late night show host !!
Thank you to the Late Late Show for all the joy and entertainment.   Best of luck to you all!!
Congratulations james n everytime i did see it was always funny n nothing personal just humor thanks again
goodbye james we're gonna miss you in late late nights! nobody could ever pull off cross walk musicals like you!!!
I thought for sure Conan would show up in that dream bit
Their last show was just like their first, very well thought out and different from the other last shows
Bye James! Onward and upward ❤
I can't believe it's over. I really loved the show. Thank you to everyone that made the show awesome. Can't wait to see you on your next project
Thank you James, Reggie and the late late show family 🙏🏽
Fuck. Why can’t it be Jimmy Kimmels final episode instead
What do we do now?😢😢😢 what do we do without big drip
Thank you James Corden and the Late Late Show crew. In the last eight years; It has always been a pleasure for me to watch this program.❤️
We will miss you  love y I hope you live wonderful Life and I wish for you to be happy just like you Made us happy…and we want u to tell us when One Direction came back together🫥😭😭
Thank you to the whole team for 8 wonderful years. The laughs, The Skits, The Guests, and the Team has made this show what it is today. Good luck on all of your future endeavors. We Will Miss You All!!!  Much Love and Warm Hugs to each and every one of you!!!! <3 <3 <3  (Not a dry tear at all)
He is the coolest. I have a feeling we will be hearing from him. He is a legend.
Thanks for the memories James corden for hosting the late late show with james corden
❤ OMG thank you James, I really 😢 will miss you

Oh my God, nooooo! I’ll miss this show. Best of luck James!😢
Thanks for all of the laughs James!!!
Can someone tell me whats happening?? Seen so many different videos like this 😢
James will always be known as the biggest directioner ever! SO MUCH LOVE❤
17:45
James, you are amazing.  Thank you for being you!
What will the brain dead watch now?
If I would talking about america as story, so, late late show will take one of a big chapter in it
Not even a million viewers watched this show at night. 32nd (2nd to last most popular on cbs) place. With those numbers, it was a cult following like most late night these days.
Love this show, but I really thought this last show would be so much bigger. Doesnt feel like a good enough stand off for them.
Good fucking riddance
@17.51 that lady passed out omd
Next up the Gavin and Stacey Christmas special?… 🙏
Thank you James Corden from 🇨🇦🍁
thank u james!! i ll miss this soooo much even though im not in the us but i love this show. I cried soo much watching the last episode. i ll miss u. thank u james❤❤for eight years
Thank you James and the entire crew for all the memories and laughter. This was really one of the best late night shows. And good luck James on your all your future endeavours!
The stairwell was funny, ❤🎉 Cheers James
😢
Harry means no….. but when I’m not as successful and I’m old then yes
Annoying crowd
It’s the moment when the video ends and you know another episode isn’t coming, that’s what stings the most
Thanks James and everyone at the Late Late Show for being a bright spot in my day for the last 8 yrs. I will miss everything you do. Also loved Trevor's cameo xD
Omg I’m gonna miss this show so funny and well written.
❤❤❤
thank you james for so many amazing moments. for the laughs, the tears all of it. i will never forget any of it❤
Remember to be good to yourself and your family as you re-enter life back home.  It's not always easy, so be gentle.  Good luck and thank you!
i had the breach opportunity to watch it live but i can’t resist watching it again even though i cried.
This made me so emotional
Thank you James you will be missed terribly 😘❤️
I see a Santa Claus role in Will’s future 😄
They should just bring the late late show to England
I thought Fallon is gonna come out during the fake laugh segment 🤣
You've had an amazing run and  and opportunity. This was a job only some of us could dream of. You brought out the best in people who are famous and showed they are just like us and gave them a break to just have fun. Thank all of you for an unforgettable adventure. 😢
James singing at the end got me. I was holding on before that
Many thanks to every single one of you💚💙
this show peaked during the time of covid. Just these guys bantering, having fun during the monologue will always be the highlight for me. When the audience wasnt there.
We will miss you our British bloke
17:50 THAT GIRL LITTERALLY FELL LOOOL
Duno why Trevor felt amazing there he a big ass racist in his own country smsp.
Congratulations James, and thank you all who made this show so entertaining. I will miss my carpools :'( My favorite Late Late Show segment! Please do more even from England James. And keep doing your acting, James! :)
Now that James and Trevor are gone all we have left is Stephen Colbert. Will miss ya James!
Thnx 🙏
all I can say James...welcome home xxx
Thank you for eight fantastic years we are gonna miss this show so much ❤️😭
Good riddance
What an awesome and emotional clip to end the show..I'm sad because im gonna miss it..and happy for James finally he is bound home..thanks for the many laughs ❤❤❤
WILL MISS YOU ALL!!! Thank you for HELPING ME and EVERYONE laugh when we couldn't find a way to on our own  !!  Im crying... i really am.💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔
Thank you!
All great till the end lol he's not playing that piano...but I still had a tear in my eye
I just remembered the end of the Truman Show which everyone who was so eager about truman, when the show ends, change the channel as if nothing was ever happen before 😢
Thank goodness. Goodbye. 👋
Cant believe this one ended💔 thankyou james & everyone
The end of an era😢
What a beautiful ending to a wonderful show - well done and all the best to your next gig.
An awesome run.  Unforgettable.  Thank you If imitation is the highest praise, bring it late night hosts
I will miss know your role and take a break on the late late show
Loved the final show! All the best James
I'm sure that isn't the first penis.
Thank you for the joy and the happiness, it was literally the perfect show to watch, there will never be a show like that ever again  Thank you James and thanks for every single person in the crew  Love from Egypt 🇪🇬❤️❤️
Just Love!
So did they end the show due to poor ratings?

Sending my love and support from singapore
Crying. Love u james
I'm gonna miss your humor James!
Why Conan and Leno not invited?
thank you so much :( ill miss the show sm !! good luck for life everyone
James may not be the greatest person ever but I respect him so much for having Harry Styles as a guest on the last show and asking him whether One Direction will ever reunite. It feels like it's deliberately taunting all the Directioners, which is so funny to me.
No one cares, you want to leave then leave.
i’ll miss this show so much</3
What a awesome ending thank you James for 8 years best comedy on TV will be missed
Late night will never be the same without you buddy! Thank you for being you! GOAT!❤️
I can’t believe that the show has ended and I hate that it ended , but I’ll be forever for you James for this incredible show,we love and we’re forever and ever proud of you,thank you so much for all these wonderful and amazing years James and the whole staff 💛love you so much😊💜
I love the way Harry moved desk “shrapnel” from the couch so that Will didn’t sit on it. 😊
😢❤
Goodbye corny Show
Awesome show every night will miss you tons. ❤ love your carpool  karaoke. Best of luck with your next endeavors.
Thank u for everything james goodbye until we meet u again
such a bittersweet goodbye! thanks to the whole team for so many memories ❤️ the first time i ever watched this show i was 12… and now i’m 20… its safe to say that i grew up watching james transform the scene of late late shows! i’ll miss it so much, but all great things must come to an end. sending love!!
Thank you for sharing your show.
James you’re amazing, I’m literally crying the whole program and with that ending you kill me, I’m so proud of you and it’s so sad the end of the show but thanks for this 1200 episodes, you deserve everything you have and more, love you from méxico ❤
❤So touching at the end😢
12:32 My cat waking me up in the morning
❤❤❤Love u all& WELCOME BACK JAMES IN EUROPE!!!We need u❤
Literally couldn't give 2 fucks about Biden.. Not sure why he's even on here.
Thank you James for making my evenings what they were for the last 8 years. I hope whatever you undertake next will bring you happiness and success. Much love to you!!!
For some America as you said it  signify war destruction and death  For some, freedom but only in the USA. For some, racism but really we are somewhat racist. In the end we only blame our selves, no one else
Holy goodness the bedroom scene is amazing!
thank you james for all the memories, will miss you so so much and all the best for your future. Sending love from India ❤
8 full years of laughter! Thank you so much for everything james! I’ll miss watching the James corden show…. Good luck on everything your planning on doing! ❤
What a great song and lovely crowd to end.. gonna miss this show. Love from PH🇵🇭
Did the first girl fall getting in to her seat once Harry walked by??
That was pretty good:)
Will miss you, James! Thanks for always bringing so much joy ❤
first conan now james
Thank God this egomaniac if finally done.
12:10 The 'Mega Collab' we badly needed! All the best "Jimmy Kimberly!" 😀 #Jimmy_Kimmel #Jimmy_Fallon
I’m sobbing 😭 Thank you for entertaining us these past 8 years. I’m not even an American but you were part of my life whenever I’m feeling down and need a good laugh. Love you and the team, thank you all the way from Indonesia.
😢😢 why are you ending... Means your coming back to the UK were we have to suffer now. Can't you stay in  America, they want you more than us!!! League of Their Own is better now your not in it!!!
Good luck James!!!!!
Thank god it’s over
i can’t believe it’s over :(
Thanks for the full look, was Reggie's Q a nod to Craig? after the others. Super touch.
After Trevor Noah a couple of Werks ago, ist’s James‘ turn. Sooo sad to lose such incredible smart and human entertainers😢. In these difficult times for the entire world and its future, your extremely funny and smart voice will be deeply missed. All the best James for you and your family and merci for all the joy you have given to my heart
Imagine walking past the entire crew knowing 98% of them hate your fucking guts.
Pedo Pete issues him a farewell.....nice touch
😭😭😭😭😭
Thank you James the band, the writers and the crew wishing you all good luck
The biggest surprise in all of this was that the desk was just a cheaply made prop and not an actual well made desk
Thank u james for making laugh when I wanted to cry .u always made my day .I'm definitely going to miss watching u ❤
Will miss carpool karaoke 😭😭😭😭
Finally James Corden is literally male version of Amy Schumer
4:27 From "What's" to "What?", from "Door - issue - has been resolved" to "Door issue - Have been resolved" - flight of stairs - freed Astaire - fright of stars. It's some We after all. War is not the issue. "Horses".
PLEASE tell me everyone saw the woman at 17:52 fall over.
Good luck in this next chapter James and crew! Thanks for all the fun and distraction from the world that can be a shitshow sometimes 🩵
Damn I cried hard
James your a great man and I’ll still watch your karaokes and other stuff you did. Enjoy your future and your family.
Insane that Multiverse with Meyers, Colbert, Kimmel and Fallon.
My favorite part  ♥ 39:55
the girl falling at 17:51 …I get it
The Late Night Host scene was great but it really highlighted the lack of diversity in late night comedy.
Who will take over for him?????
This could be the late late show of the series
Can’t stand biden but that was funny “can’t sing worth a damn “ 😅
James you are the most light-filled and talented, cool guy I've ever seen.  Thank you for the peace and joy and laughs.  Love from Australia.  You are truly an inspiration.  Uk is lucky to have you back.
I love you❤
I love this show so much. I’m so sad it’s over. It’s such great vibes. James killed it. The band killed it. Ian killed it. What an awesome ending.
Will miss the karaoke. 😏
Meanwhile I’m crying the entire time
ill miss you james😢❤
25:26 18:28
James you are a legend... love from Nigeria 🇳🇬
Not surprised..... americans dont have time to stay up late when both adults have to work to make it....
final show with harry 🥺💗💗
Thank you for always being a place of acceptance and joy. I will miss this but can’t wait to see the things you will do
You can't get Biden to do a legit Press Conference, but he will do James Corden's last show.  Good to see he has his priorities straight.
I think James got jealous from Wil sitting so close
he is the moment🥺🥺🥺
I will miss this so much.  Love them all.
So much NOSTALGIA 😥💔
FINALLY!!!!!!! ITS FINALLY OVER!!!!
I don't even know how to express what this show means to me. I learned English because of this show. I fell in love with comedy, music and dance because of this show. In my worst times, James and everyone else have been there for me like family and I will miss them all so much and love them all forever.❤
What a total and utter fanny.
It could be April fool.
thank you james for the past 8 years, its been incredible for us
Some of the best skits, laughs, and entertainment in late night television.  You will be missed!  Thanks & Good Luck ❤🙏❤
It was perfect! Just perfect. Thank you to all for so many  years of fantastic entertainment. Can’t wait to see what comes next when you’re ready! ❤
Lets hope that Harry Styles will be hosting some more shows somewhere as I really enjoyed times when he has hosted things.
This might be the most emotional youtube video i ever watched. Not yet quite as "So Long Nerds" but close.
Thank you so much for the every joyness you and your crew provided me. As every thing, it is also over. Love you💖💖💖
Now James is coming back to the UK, A league of their own might be good again.
I’m gutted, if only we had beaten you in the World Cup you’d have to have kept him.  Oh well, at least it was a draw so you still got to keep Harry for us
That was such a beautiful tear-jerking speech. God bless you and your loved ones. Thank you for that speech and your beautiful being ❤️🤍💙😘
I love how Niall still got to make a cameo appearance😂
Please don't send him back to the UK. You can keep him honestly.
All the Best James for you and your family. Your Terrific ❤
I’m so sad. This is my favorite and the only late night show I watch. I’m going to 😢.
Why did Harry sound like he does a snl episode at the start?
Such an incredible ending to an amazing show. So many iconic events in such a short period of time. Well done. We will miss you and your amazing family.
good riddance
You’ve been a joy to watch all these years. Thank you. Go find your next exciting adventure James. You succeeded at this adventure

Thank you James and all who made the show possible. This is the stuff that brings people closer together. Looking forward to your next ventures.
The British will always give it up to the Americans knowing we are superior , but there to thick to know...lol 😂

All the best James, it was a great late night show, the best on TV imo.
I like Harry being the last guest 💚💙🇮🇪💛❤️
I'm crying
James, no matter what the reason was, we will miss you very much.
I'm actually teary-eyed! He and the show saved me during the lockdowns. Will miss this!
He's the worst
james show will be missed; his true persona would not. Go rot, james condom
I thought there's no way that Harry Styles won't be in the final show, and here he is ❤ it was a must, knowing the friendship James and Harry have.
You won't be missed
Glad that sucker is gone.
17:52 this would be me if I met Harry(the girl fell down)🥲
Now get Crsig Ferguson back...👍
Love you James, the best show and love from Australia❤❤
thank you❤️
i’ll miss this show sm
I'm going to miss James

Goodluck james ❤❤❤
Don't let the door slam you on the ass on the way out. Good riddance.
Welcome to the final show.... Thank you for the laughter and entertainment, to James and everyone involved! Love fr Philippines🇵🇭
thank you TLLS 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
good riddance to the least funny late show hosted by the dullest most vanilla milk toast blah of a guy ever!
James, in the immortal words of Johnny Carson:  “I bid you a heartfelt good night.”
At the end. It was his own doing that guaranteed his demise. It was a good run James, made a lot of good memories, but yeah.....
Lmaooo oooooooooo ooooo harry literally looks like he's late for a roller disco
JC - still in an annoying little shit, with a face you just wana bitch slap. But, hey, you can't deny, he has been a fucking good entertainer and host. 👍👍👍👍👍👍
Thank god the abomination is over
You gave light and joy.  You made us laugh.  We salute you and your entire crew.
Kimmel is the one who should be replaced by James
I'm so glad he's gone.
Goodbye
I will miss this show. I have e to say that I have never seen a show like this and I am sorry that he is leaving. James I hope that you learn the lesson of being a decent person. Treat people the way that you want to be treated. In this day and age whatever you do will come out.
jimmy fallon e james la cosa più inaspettata del 2023
lol what a loser
Stay there James DO NOT COME BACK
Joe Biden..really  James..yuck. I'll forgive you 🙂
Radiohead
Thanks to James and the entire team for such a wonderful show. You're gonna be missed. Wishing each and everyone all the best in their next adventure. 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
That bald guy must have some aura 😂
Harry is so so cheeky
So sad James Corden is the goat
I did not spell check or finish what I wanted to say, but I was really proud of James gathering all the late night entertainers together. When there was a war between all the late shows. You made so many friends.  I wish you had the first car karaoke on, not Mariah but George Michael ththe best ever.
Good thing another woke show dead
This show got me through 2020  and made me laugh on some of the worst days. I don’t usually cry at 8am but here I am. Thanks for the laughs James and crew!!
Welcome to the final show. Hope they wearing their best clothes.
18:37 And to think Craig Ferguson once had his desk taken apart by a karate chop from Bob Barker.
Harry? Really?
i’ll miss this. 🩷
Thank you James and  The Late Late Show Family for eight years of smiles and belly laughs. Carpool Karaoke will go down in entertainment history as one of the most creative ideas ever to air on television.    I am going to miss spending my week nights watching you! Good luck on your move back home and cheers to new adventures!
WHY IS IT ENDING ???????????????????????????????????????????????????
so weird for me, i’ve never seen his show, only the carpool karaokes , and i’ve heard so much shit about him lately, but this is the saddest i’ve ever been when a show ended.
James for PRESIDENT 🇺🇸
good riddens. james corden is a pompous prick. 😂
sad
Thanks for everything! We love you!
I literally cried so many times. It has been such a great time and journey can’t believe this was his last show 😭 I grew to love his show it made me so happy
I’d love this show so much more if we all didn’t know James is a massive knob in real life
All the late night hosts coming together for the final time is the best thing to happens on tv
Can we please have Craig back now?
Thanks for the laughs and entertainment greatest Late Late show ever gonna miss ya 😁🥹
Finally!
He's the only late night show host and comedian I watched..this is sad.😢..best wishes James.
A great Entertainer with an elite Team. Thank you all for your work. 😢
Hard to put into words how much I loathe this phoney
Thank you James for such an incredible show. This has made me happy when I’ve been feeling down for years and it has been just incredible
💔
ill say it…we were expecting 4 more guys to be there,but we really dearly appreciate you for having harry as ur last guest! Thank u james for everything <3
Oh my heart 💔 Great job gang, you'll be missed!!
I ❤James I been watching this when it Frist came on cbs
THE LATE ⏰ LATE ⏰ SHOW ON CBS 1995-2023: THE END
James good luck, thanks for hosting the late late show🎶❤
Thankyou so much James and the crew! ❤ I have never missed an episode, and even went to a taping of your show years ago when I visited LA from AUS.......was soooo lucky as got to sit in the first row and Tom Hiddleston was a guest 🥰 I even had ur parents on one of my Virgin Australia domestic flights when I was a flight attendant (pre pandemic), and I remember telling them how much I loved their son and the show 😍 I am truly so sad this show is finished, and ill definitely miss watching u everyday. Sending u and the crew soooooo much love all the way from Australia and thanks again for all the laughs 😂 Love to u all, and all the best with your future endeavours everyone 🇦🇺 😘 xx
I saw everyone except NICK......!!! A great cast, crew and staff, all so funny and heartwarming. Cherish what you have.......You've been a really great friend to all of them James.....You've been a great "ambassador" for the UK, the warmth and camaderie with fellow Brits.....Bravo.....This is a really good show.....!!!
Finally
Amid all the well deserved positivity earned over the 1,200 shows. Where was Nick Bernstein? Fired because he didn't get James to stay or ... ?
It was wonderful eight years ✋🤚🥹
James it's been a privilege and a  pleasure 🎉😢 🙏🏾 god bless u ❤️ good luck moving back home 🙏🏾
Dang....kinda sad... Thankz  PEACE
Thank you James and crew for 8 wondering years! Im going to miss all of you!
THE LATE ⏰ LATE ⏰ SHOW WITH JAMES CORDEN ON CBS 2015-2023: THE END
Ian really loved this show! Damn. Those tears made me tear up too
The end is just the beginning.
Corden is so funny and has such a likable persona. He was a regular company during lockdowns. Pity about his bad temper, he should learn how to managed that, it's a thing that can destroy careers.
It's been a great 8 years, and I have watched all of them.....A Big Thanks.....to a great cast, band, crew and staff who have featured prominently as part of the family and show.....Very talented bunch indeed, will miss all of them......And James, you have delivered some of the most innovative and creative sketches/skits/segments on Late Night TV....and this includes the very interactive format with the staff which became such a huge hit with your audience and fans. Poking fun and being full of yourself in some of the skits has been such comedy gold .....WELL DONE JAMES....safe returns and all the best.....!!!
Why does Harry dress like sissies, is he a boy or a girl?
i feel sick that he's on his way back here. God help us all.
Glad to see you out of the States, it was an experience, but any longer you'd become so insular you was becoming boring ...but great you embraced american insular culture , time to leave now for the real world...Good luck!!
A sad goodbye to James Corden's late night talk show.
❤😢
just here not to say good Luck,and goodbye and good riddance (im not even sure if i leave a like or a dislike cause im happy the peacock is gone  but also sad the show doesnt continue with a new host )
Love this! Gonna miss this show so much.
I will truly miss this great show, it was so refreshing through out the years.  Both his guest were amazing and so funny. The main thing that James  he brought all the late,  late shows
Can we just ship James over to London and keep the rest of this? Lauren or Ian could take over. It wouldn't miss a beat.
Next Chelsea Manager
I hope he's not retiring and coming home to write and film more gavin and Stacy ❤
Absolutely loved seeing all the fellow late show hosts and Letterman, that was brilliantly written and performed. Great final show ❤
"You are embarrassing your country."   He didn't have to do my man like that😭
Omgosh this is sooooooo sad  I missed why the show is  ending  I always love this man ❤❤❤
Miss ya James!!
James is one of the sweetest people along side harry ofc, their friendship is so adorable. its sad to see james go. I LOVE YOU HARRY, JAMES & WILL!!!
ig we were all delusional 😭
Finally the end to this washed up arrogant so called comedian
And Radiohead as introduction's music 😍🤩 that's just perfect
Radiohead W
REGGIE!!!! Best feeling ever. “Ladies and gentlemen, all the way from exactly where humanity exists, as a non-divided species…….”. Best statement ever!!!!   Should be on a tshirt! ******HUMANITY EXISTS WHERE THE NON-DIVIDED SPECIES ARE.****** (BUT!!!! You have to truly live that life, so there’s an application process)😬
So many agendas so little time..
Styles must have that ugly pantsuit in every color.
Does this mean we can get Craig Ferguson back now?
I'm gonna miss you so so much Jamse;) You personally and you with our boys❤️
One direction reunion is possible woohoo
"When I first moved here - to America to take over this show, everybody here was talking of the late night wars, then I came to realize we are not a war, we are family. We have been so much together. When you think about it, we are just some funny wars, we are allowed to spread some joy."
What a cheap table 😂 I am pretty sure it wasn’t the real one.
James you’re so amazing!
This has to the the worst “final” episode in all history.
I will miss you so much Jame, thank you for everything you have done. Is time to go home.
Having WILL PHARRELL and HARRY STYLES as the last was perfect 😭💗
וואלה התרגשתי
Who is crying? Me? Nah WELL YES
Would much rather had Trump!
You can tell how much of an impact this show has had on people when you look at the crowd. When James left, everyone in the audience was crying and hugging each other. 😭 We'll miss you James
Loved every moment and episode of this show. Thank you so much for these wonderful 8 years! ❤
We will miss you James!!!
Can we mention the girl who passed out after Harry Styles fist bump her? 😂 17:52
It's now the end of a franchise, as CBS has brought the Late Late Show to an end entirely.  It started with Tom Snyder in the mid-90s.  Both Craig Kilborn and Craig Ferguson spent some time in-between, and it's ending with James. Even if it did continue, they would have needed to tape elsewhere, as the current owners of Television City will be starting a big renovation on the property soon.
Damn I’m going to miss him!
This is subtle genius taking the piss out of American planning, it has to follow time scales to get all the adverts in , sod the content, land of the fee...lol 😂
This is the first time I've ever seen a full episode, and what a treat it was. From start to finish, I laughed and (almost) cried. Congratulations to James and everyone involved in the success of this show. The successor has big shoes to fill...Good luck to you all!! Love from Australia! Xx
Oh, this show kept me in a good spirit through breakups, loss of job, search for a new one, COVID, the beginning of full scale war and occupation, pregnancy, the everyday routine.. James is the impersonation of humor to me. Not irony or satire with their bitterness, but good old laugh. Huge thanks from your Ukrainian fans❤️
Another crappy show down the toilet, Where's the next Johnny Carson for this era?
I was truly expecting Conan Obrien to appear in the TV Host Skit
Finally, this piece of crap is gone.  Let Britain have him back
I first saw your show 2 months ago. I have 8 years ahead! Eight years of good, laughter, eight years of happiness. ❤
I’m going to cry James 😭❤️
🙌 33:30 and on Preach. Amen.  ❤❤
going to miss watching you as a host for the late late show i hope you continue to do big things so so proud of you
Not many in entertainment leave on the top. This guy did it perfectly.
I pleased you are coming back home can't wait 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
heartbreaking! but sooo much joy over the years. Thanks James!
It’s been a good run hope to see you in other stuff James when I make it as an actor/entertainer hope to collab with you
Thank you all for being a part of my life. That part is really beautiful ❤
James has smashed it James your come back with another great show  I'm sure this isn't the last goodbye  definitely  not  I laughed I've cried you are brilliant witty and everyone loves you thankyou for Been a great entertainment  entertainer  ❤❤❤❤
Thank you James and everyone. You really made the last couple years bearable. Letterman showing up made the night.
James, Reggie, Band, Producers and all the Crew backstage and in the front of the stage for all 8 years, just amazing, fun, emotional and enjoyable, lots of laughs for everyone James have a safe trip home and enjoy your time with Your Family and Friends .... ..❤😂❤😂❤😂..
Thank you for bringing joy and laughs from your 1200 shows during the last 8 years!
Thanks James for great content and your efforts and everything... we love you.  Goodluck for your next chapter of life 💜 we'll miss this show. 💜
Wow, he left and One Direction didn't happen.
Congrats James and team, thanks for the laughs! Best of luck with the London phase of your life!
fat boi made the $, dont worry folks he will land as always somewhere to be over-rated as always.xD
As an australian I fell in love with your show with the carpool videos. I will never forget when it was FINALLY my time to be in your audience in 2016... I WILL NEVER FORGET THAT DAY!
Gonna miss this show 😢 💜
Good riddance!
Feels like a breakup and I don’t want this to end ❤❤❤ You’re phenomenal James! Thank you for bringing laughter and joy into our hearts. We can’t wait to welcome you back to London! ❤❤❤
Gonna miss u James thanks for all the memories 🤍
Congratulations James.... 😊❤ But no one direction reunion????? 🤔🤔
Thank you james! I loved this show since the begining and i'll always! 💗💯
This show has been amazing I'm going to miss it so much best of luck to everyone ❤
Seems like the world is catching up to Prince style bit by bit see that harry styles outfit
Thank you James for everything. We are going to miss you.
Absolutely none of these shows will ever be repeated. Corden should reconsider coming back to the UK as there simply isn't anyone over here that will work with the fella. An atrociously untalented fella...who has zero talent.
THE DESK LOLLLL  Wait the desk is back? Videos must be out of order or I'm losing it ha.
One word.... Cowabunga! 👍
Pure scum tool.
24:06 bro I know for a fact that's a lie
Look at those LB shoes 😂
anyone else notice the John Wick music playing at the start
Thank’u so much for everything u done James, I love you so much 🥺❤️
Bravo
James Cordon is awesome. I will miss his show. Wish him well.
❤❤❤❤
Bye
Seeing James presenting the last episode of the show makes me wanna cry. It really has been so fun to watch. Good luck James and thank you for all the work you've done to just make us laugh we wish you all the best ❤
Hmm conpared to other comments about him
thank you for the show james ❤
To be honest, James looks bisexual 😂😂😂
Why is the show ending?
Thanks James and the whole crew wishing you all the best we will forever miss the show ❤️
Thanks for all the laughs over the years James!
Thank you
little me cant take this
Finishing the race well. Thank you Corden for your service. You are goated in my eyes. Good luck to you and your family and your future endeavors. It's not a goodbye, it's a see you later. Much love always. ❤👑
Good luck papa Mochi!!
What an exceptional group of people making this show outstanding! James Cordon, all the very best to you and your family....I mean...no one will be able to replace this type of show! All the movie stars that came with such good sport to bring some light at the end of days that can be most challenging.  We will follow you to see what is next for you Sir James!💝🇨🇦
Am i the only one thinking A. What a waste of a great table B. How strong theyre? Litterly if i tried, the hammer would get stuck, barely making a dent  C. I wonder if H knows Ws art...   What a great episode in general.
I'm pretty sure everyone knew Harry was going to be in the last episode
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I cried for someone who's i never meet. Watching you only on Youtube .Thank you James Corden . Thank you to the Band , Producers and all crew.
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
James Corden once beat out James Earl Jones for a Tony award. Oddly enough, James Earl Jones is my vote for the next host of the late late show.
What a beautiful send off. One of the greatest shows. James and crew will truly be missed!
OMG. I'M CRYING.. JAMES IS SINGING.. 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Why i cried 😢😅 OMG
Nobody gonna talk about the One Direction reunion?🤯
James Corden, you are good man, good luck!
If you watched this and didn't tear up, you're already dead
I remember I arrived in the US and only a few months later he started and he kept me company ever since. Good luck James for everything...and pls don't ever stop singing :P
The dream bit with the talk show hosts was sheer genius! Going to miss the show greatly. Always loved the news bit! Good luck to you in the future! 💙
im sobbing i cant believe this
Seriously this is the best team effort show, their deranged Covid news was the best thing at that time. ❤
i cried the entire episode and still am, He tried so hard not to cry the whole show but he couldn't hold it in anymore at the end, I cried the entire time I tried to hold it in James did a better job than i did and i will and we will miss him and thank you James for 8 years of laughter when i had a bad day your show made me feel better and i love you and thank you for being there for us. Thank you for everything James You will be truly missed no other late-night show is like yours❤❤xxooxxooxxoo
Horrible intro skit! I hate it when they try so hard! Nothing organic or authentic about it! So rehearsed it lacks creativity
❤❤❤❤❤Thank you James for being my favourite late night host , we will surely miss Ur show !
All got things must come to an end, not the case here but it had a long run
We love you James- you bring so much joy- so thankful for the many moments you brought us all a much needed laugh and made us all feel hopeful and connection- many blessings to you and your family- you will be greatly missed❤️🥰
keep me in your heart for a while ❤❤
good luck to james and the rest of the crew, some amazing bits has come from this show over the past 8 years
The Last Show. Thank You James & The Crew. You have kept me interested and vested in the show, it's people, the staff the stars and everything in between. This could have gone on forever. It's been that good. But it shows you, us as humans - if we can't be there for our parents when they have been there for us. Then what is even the point of it all. Love your parents. Money, fun and fame can happen to anyone, you can have it one minute and it's gone the next, and it's back again just like that. But your parents, when they are gone that is it. No comebacks.   See you at a Hammers game James! ⚒️
I hate that everything I've grown to love over the years is ending in 2023 😢
So strange that this is ending. I've never watched the actual show but have been following on YouTube since that first week hide-and-seek in a random person's house. It's been a ride. Gonna miss it.
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
After seeing so many Late Night shows go out, James Corden's final send off was bitter sweet but at least he did it on his own terms.  This was a proper good bye, definitely something I haven't seen in awhile.
Where is Tom cruise?
Its so sad when something end, but its the life, what can we do?
Is Craig coming back?
thank you james ♥️
tite
Ha ah 😂 door is locked James 😂😂
Good riddance 😂
Thank you James for everything over the past eight years. This show brings the world so much joy, and personally, the little segments (take a break, mystery pizza) helped me through some dark times and I'd go back to them again and again. James is the best, he's not only funny but he also has so much love for humanity. So sad this is over. Best wishes to him and his family ❤
Sad Steve didn’t go crazy on the jingle one more time 😭… will miss the show so much!!!!
I’m so beyond sad to see this show end thank you for the past 8 years of laughs and smiles it’s been a great ride
So fake even his normal stance looks fake
Another person loses their job this week that we are better for.
Bro the clapping at the start stopped instantaneously
holy shit i bet all you lefties loved this show lmao everybody on this woke leftist show are wronguns on every level .......#ifyouKNOWyouKNOW AND FOR THE ONES THAT DONT KNOW .....enjoy the show!! #weakmindedsheep
Finally,James become singer💝
You guys will be missed. Thank you for the fun times and laughters.
My heart… going to miss you buddy! Thank you for all the amazing memories

Thank you James!!!❤❤
Who still likes James Corden lol
Thank god james cordon cant desecrate the nightly circut anymore.
Will miss him and the crew.  Who can blame him for wanting to bring up his children outside the US.
i cant believe we're witnessing this
100% turn off that he had that creep from the wh on the show.  the viewers deserved better.
We filled it with thousands of moments of joy and now there won't be any more
Its finally over brilliant now just jimmy kimmel stephen colbert seth myers and jimmy fallon left
Biden was the highlight of the show 😂
Thank You!! we’re going to miss you 😭
I’m sad. It’s his last show. Wish he had stayed over in the US forever. So arrogant.
Thank you for all years , you often make me smile😊. You made the right choice, you're children will never forget that you made this choice for them. I wish you  much off love and hapiness with you're family❤. With love from Amsterdam 😘
I WILL MISS THIS AMAZING SHOW... JAMES IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST... and I'm really really going to miss car karaoke. Oh my goodness I had so much fun all these years watching. And the way that James new all of the songs it was just so much fun. I wish this wasn't the end of The Late Late Show because I've always enjoyed it but I'm happy for James that he's going out with a bang and that he's going back home but we will definitely miss him and a big thank you to the band and all of the producers and everyone behind the scenes that made this such an incredible show every night.
So now in which comment section where I spam get one direction back
Farewell James Corden 🙏
Waitt… did that girl just fell after touching harry styles!??? Right after that fist bump… 17:50
PEAK CORDEN
Thank you, James and the team ... God speed!
Sad tried to get tickets to London 2 or 3 days in a row each time got in line and sold out, and what’s worse 2 people in front of me where last people to get tickets, now will never have this opportunity again 😢😢
Harry dressed like everybody's aunt Nellie ..Jesus 😂😂😂
We are gonna miss u James........Now u can atleast be 1direction manager
Good luck to everybody working on the show!! It was a good run! sorry to see it end! x
First Trevor Noah then James, what are we gonna watch.  Much appreciated all 🙏💕💕💕
I just don’t understand why. They’re doing so well
Is he going back to England now to do a show there or ? Is he from England or Scotland ? He is very talanted. I haven't watch this show much since I'm trying to learn Spanish living in Mexico.
So sad 😢 I’ll miss you James
❤❤❤
His rich now so why not
Thank you! This show is incredible and i wish you all the best!! I do hope that you will somehow be involved in any future one direction reunions though! You are practically the sixth member!
We will miss you sooo much😢
I was expecting Conan to show up in the hosts bit.  I guess he is in Thailand now.
gg
I would like to be part of that James, Harry and Will sandwich
How many times did Biden have to repeat that one?
Bye, James
Thank you James.. For all the joy.. You've done a MARVELOUS job.. Sending a lot of love for you, your fams, and all the crew. ~ One of your fans from Indonesia 🥰
Late Late show was the first show that I saw, and I enjoyed it soooo much ,thanks james ,thank  you so much for late late show💙🧡🤙🏻
Thank you we will miss you best wishes for you and your family 💗❤❤🎉
Thank you James for providing us with so much entertainment and humour over the past 8 years... and for giving us One directioners even more hope of a reunion!!
dis shit finally ended.
This is crazy, I realised just how many years this show has been a part of all our lives at home watching - I literally grew up with this show. Thank you James and everyone who made this show possible and touched so many hearts through joy ❤
Don't let the door hit you on the way out.
Aww. Such a unique show. Cheerio 🥂
Thanks,James.
Thanks for putting smiles on our faces & all the best in your new endeavors ❤🎉😊.
This is how everybody wishes their last day at work went!
Loved the last show. Tearing up over James' monologue on the piano. So touching and how he got through that, we'll never know. The monologue reminded me of his performance when he hosted the Tony's...  Maybe he'll recreate a similar show when he's back home in London.
Thank god they didn't bring ellen😂
Azeshion was here
Dont come back to uk its a mess now
End of an era! 😢😢😢
James I am absolutely sad to know that this is last ever show.I just want to say massive thank you for entertaining us, thank you for all the good memories. As a Directioner, I am so happy that Harry was last guest. Thank you for always respecting and loving them as a group and individually. If boys ever decide to reunite, you should be the host definitely. We know how you love and treasure them. Thank you for all the hilarious segments,they will be in my memory forever! Take well deserved rest,hope everything will get better for you ❤ Cant believe this is the end….
God Bless You, James! Thanks to all of You for the Great Great Late Late Show :) БРАВО!!!
Can’t explain how sad I am. But also can’t wait to see what will happen next. Great show, great host. We will miss in this role, but, I’m sure, future will bring us some amazing projects of yours. Thank you 🤍
been watching since i was 12, im 19 now still up and running, i’ll be 20 in 2 weeks time
What a way to end the show with a song 😢 going to miss you James & friends
But I wonder why he ended the show they said it's because of his parents maybe his wife and kids probably some of these stars leave the show because of family comittments
Thanks for the fun James 👏
Thank you James and the band ❤
Good riddance
What's the music the plays right at the start? pretty groovy
Well, not every show needs a(nother) sidekick.
FINALLY an unfunny show is coming to an end
Will Farrell and Jon Stewart now look nearly interchangeable, as long s they both have beards.
Where was the greatest could talk show host of all time, Conan O’Brien ?
I'll miss this show so much. No more carpool karaoke? No more spill or fill your guts? Now who's gonna kidnap one direction?
Thank you so much for everything James, can’t wait to get you back home in London❤
Why did he turn into such a bellend?
Farewell James. Thank for all the laughs 😂 gonna miss you
It would be great for him to have another show maybe he wants to go into acting or on Broadway 🎭
The end of an era. To new beginnings 🌟
screaming from public is tasteless and demented.I struggle through it.
Will Ferrel should play Moses next 😂
I'm so sad this is ending it's beeny childhood for so long and this new generation is not gonna experience it and im so glad he asked the last question about the one direction reunion 💗 I LOVE YOU
thank you James and everyone behind the scenes for everything you've given us. Im sad to see it's all ending but I'll be forever thankful for all the amazing work you've put in for us all for the past 8 years. wishing you all the best of luck on your next adventure, and i know it'll be amazing. thank you!!
Thank you James for everything
I'll remember seeing the first show & the last. It reminded me my mom, times of that house, I miss those times.   I enjoyed both the 1st & last show, truly. Thank you to everyone responsible for the show. God bless. Thank You. Very sincerely.
The last bit took a piece of my heart. Sincerely, thank you!
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Thank you James, for finally cashing out. I hope you become completely irrelevant. Because you're an illuminaughty boy
thank you james for the many many years of happiness that your show has brought to me ❤❤
James I’m not Amerrrrican but I will miss the news…
Harry I love you I love you
Ian soo should have followed the "we got one from trump" by getting an impersonator 😂
He has some fresh ideas but the dialogue between the band sounds like only inside jokes and outsiders can't get it. Was Regie eating salad during the show? So I stopped watching until tonight to see Harry styles
Im glad he was trying to warn americans and to see common ground instead of  polarizing and dividing.
Good luck bro
Thank you, James.
Everyone has watched that becauze one direction...
I'll miss the lady playing bass guitar.
Thank you, James and the entire crew for all the fabulous entertainment over the past 8 years!❤
the person who collapsed after harry fist bumped them hahaha
Finally that prick is off TV for good
Oh this so sad man😢what are we going to watch now, best late night show ..we going to miss you James and Ian and Reggie and the rest of the fabulous crew..❤all the best back in the UK 🇬🇧love from South Africa 🇿🇦💚
mr. prick leaves :')
Good riddance!!! I'm still scratching my head as to how he ever got this gig in the first place!
Thank you for every thing
Please keep him over there in America, we don't want him back.
we need a jingle montage
A Brit telling Americans what America is about…? Yeah we kinda started a whole war so we‘d never have to deal with that.
Thank you for making us forget everything and laugh💕
I’m going to miss you so much james!
Thanks for all the great entertainment you surely will be missed
James, I know you’ll hear this a million times but you will be so missed. I’ve watched you every night. You’ve brought me joy and laughter every single show.  I have a chronic nerve disorder and can’t walk any more. You’ve brought me so much happiness during my diagnosis and the beginning stages of this condition. You made me smile and laugh till I I was crying so many times. You brought me out of the pain. Thank you for YOU. I’m so happy for you and your family going home. It will be the start of a wonderful new journey.  God-speed. And thank you.
Anyone here for a one direction reunion? 🤡
Next role cyber man in doctor who ❤ 😂😂😂😂😂😂😊
OMG! This is great! They are super! 👍🥰❤️💯🥰👍
😭😭😭💔💔It was my dream that if I ever become a pop star I will definitely go to the amazing Late Late show, but it will always remain a dream for me...🥺well i will always love u James ur carpool Karoke were really amazing, relaxing and entertaining for me...., I will always remember that there was an American TV show  named THE LATE LATE SHOW WITH JAMES CORDEN 🌟🌆🥺😌😊
How old is everyone in this comment section? James Cordon is a massive 🔔 end
not me crying my eyes out
What happened to that girl at 17:50 after giving a fist bump to Harry???!!! Did she passed out??
Wow, James collagen I am finally happy that you have your last show because of that because it’s been it’s been like over the years. Do you have a en show? Well done because I’m we are so proud and and miss well Danny Lam’s got it We are so it has been hard for you. Well done everyone saying thank you from Sahil.❤
love u james thank you for the laughter and happiness you’ve brought upon us all
President Biden sent video message to Mr.James！If James statesman he could 　be good messnger to same age Zelenski of Ukrane not U.K.rainy.NATO is like Jaoanese vegan food NATTO not nescessary only made Putin angry. EU is very important,U.K.should go back,Polish low wage warkers seems no harm to U.K.❤
♥️♥️♥️
That was a total class act!!!👏👏👏👏
Good Riddance.
Good luck for what's next James, thanks to all the crew for the laugh and the memories, it's been a lot of fun. Those 8 years went through too fast. All the best!
The prime time show was fantastic I can't wait to watch the DVR recording of the last last late late show. Thank you for entertaining us eight years, we will miss you, the band the staff... everything about The late late show with James Corden will be missed,
My feeling was quite complicate while watching the last episode. For the last six year I was alone in a foreign country, James cordon and the late late show bring me so much joy and  it’s a runaway from reality. I’ve seen how they struggled through the pandemic like optimistic pessimists, as the rest of the world did, and I enjoyed the safe and present space it created during that suffocating period. But when the show went back to normal, I find myself not a fan any more, maybe because I have so much to catch up in my personal life, or the late late show suddenly became irrelevant. I feel James made a correct decision closing the show, since we all need to move on.
goodbye James Corden America will miss you unless you make the movie in America
The end of an era after 28 years the late late show comes to an end
I really don't wanna watch this video being the last one here..... So entertaining with a host that knows his job It's so sad to see the late late show coming to an end💔
Harry's declaration of love for James :( <3
Should've left after the pilot.
Thank you so much James for these I love you endless and I wish you the best! ❤️
Thank you so much james and the crew for what you have done to bring smiles to everyone. Wish you the best of luck with your new journey
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
You have made me laugh for so long! You will be missed James!
YOU GUYS ARE HILARIOUS TOGETHER
Thanks James and the team! I’m not in the states however I ALWAYS enjoy watching your show on YouTube. You are a true talented and loving host, I enjoy every moment while you in it.  Looking forward to see your new projects!!❤ Thank for the wonderful 8 years!
The brilliance in America light is shining a little less brightly now that you’ve left the stage.  Bravo.
Thanks James, nice to meet u and I´ll miss u so much 🥺❤❤❤
This type of programming is brainwashing and exactly why our society is fucked.  Anyone consuming this or celebrating it is literally making the world a less intelligent, trashier place, and you are servicing the ruling class with your mindless consumerism.
I don't know what to say,  when I was younger, I always had this dream that I'd become famous and  talk to James on his show, sadly I won't be doing that now that is ending but the late late show will forever be my favorite show ❤❤❤❤❤
It's such a shame James showed his true colours, showing the world how arrogant and entitled he feels he is. I truly thought his show was great and that he's talented.
I've been waiting for this from the day when i heard the news that mah Harold coming in late late show 😭
This show is what started everything. James i love you so much, and thank you for being such a wonderful and respectful host. You're a beautiful angel
Dear James, you came to america and healed and saved the latenight world.  After eight years, it's time to move on.  I understand that.  Please come to Germany and do the same.  Greetings from Germany ^^
The carpool is the best!
Thank you🎉😢 James Corden for entertaining us for the last 8 years you created some the most icon clips on the internet,i hope you all the best in ur next chapter still bringing us a good laugh, Congratulations on the next chapter!
Have enjoyed watching from Australia. Thank you and best wishes. 🇦🇺💕xx
Don't tell him that Ryan Tubridy has resigned
Glad the show is ending. It's about damn time.
Now I want an SNL episode with Will Ferrell and Harry Styles co-hosting.
Aaaaaaaaaaaa finally 😭
Thank you James for spreading so much laughter and joy.
Good riddance. Poopoo head
Notice that someone has slammed that door handle against the wall before.
James and his team added something to the late night era. That final song was lovely. 🐑🐑🇳🇿🇳🇿NZ
Cordon has gone from being innovative, creative and funny before he went to the States, to an Americanised, bland unfunny idiot. Please don't come back. Stay there and wallow in canned laughter.
Karpool Karaoke was a stoke of genius.. James sure came along way from Smith'y to Gavin and Stacey which led him to the attention of America.  Can be very proud of himself 👍
♥♥♥♥♥♥♥
I don’t know what was more painful watching this last show or James cordons whole career
fat
Love. Gratitude 💙☺️ and best wishes of love and luck in your future. We’ll miss you.
I ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ELF, ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤HARRY❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤JAMES!!!!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Good Riddance!
James Corden stay cool, God bless you ♥️✌️😎
Thank you so much James! We will miss you !
Thank you for James and everyone at the late late show for everything you created❤❤❤❤❤
James,  I watched the last episode of your show today and I cried along with you, you are amazing and your show is amazing,  I believe in you and wish you success in the future and that in the near future you will succeed in uniting One Direction  from me with lots of love   Y❤️‍🩹
Good Riddance
Will miss you james Thanks to the entire team of late late show ❤️
Thank you for entertaining us for the past 8 years.
We are gonna miss you a lot 😢😢❤
did not know he could play the piano - knew he's an acclaimed actor/singer in his West End theatre shows (same as Broadway). He's very accomplished to play like that, esp. without looking!
Please don't go!!! I will miss your show very much!!!! At least make some movies!!! So that we can see you again!!!
That desk was definitely made in america
is Ian crying
goodbye. thanks from germany.
17:44 harry’s appearance.  No need to thank me <3

Thank you James & all the crews 🖤🖤🖤
Loooooved it and I just looove James and Harrys friendship! Glad H was the final guest ❤
You have been a great reason I watch your show on my phone nightly. I appreciate all that you have done over the years. I commend you and your entire staff. I am grateful for the memories you, Reggie and the rest have given me over the years. My sincerest blessings to everyone.
Thank you for 8 years of laughter, commentary, the great variety of skits, bits, musical numbers but most importantly the guests. You came and changed the landscape of late night shows and we will never forget you.
From the bottom of my heart... thank you for the show! <3
Don't be sad because it's over, be happy because it happened. Thank you James.
Honestly jb should have been here. They had such good chemistry.
17:52 the way the girls who fist bumped Harry styles fainted is totally what would have happened to me
Thank you James!!! The world is a happier place because of you!! Thank you for the sunshine!! Big love from Australia!!
You're still amazing - loved to watch your(s) show even from Germany! Keep staying such a fantastic person!
i still had hope for the 1d reunion :/
Thank you so much for uploading it for the rest of the world to see 🥺🙌🏼 I kinda understand why he's doing it, but also still can't understand why. I'm gonna miss this a lot ☹️
Beautiful show.   Nothing like it ever before
mio amore ❤
Really good last show but sad and funny at the same time last show very memorable. I'll miss you
Thank you for 1200 episodes of entertainment and laughter.  You will be missed.
Congratulations James : you are the best !
😮😮😮😢😢😢 but but but ..... I do understand it's James decision and i respect that....but are we going to see you again on tv is there going to be a surprise act with Harry ❤❤❤❤❤
I love James but Trump Magats are evil
Thank you James corden and team for giving beautiful memories since day one , I m your biggest fan from sri lanka  , lots of love 💟
Love from India 🇮🇳♥️
Please keep him in the US
Are we having more gavin and stacey.
Nothing really last for a long time anymore, imagine eight years is celebrated as if it was 25 years with tears and fanfare and I get it, James like many others build connections quickly, he's a great host, did an excellent job. Eight years just doesn't give many like myself the goosebumps as if I truly knew him.
I must say I really enjoyed this show all these years
🥹🥹🥹
We all can't leav you james😢😢😢❤
"sniff"  Thank you James and the whole crew.  I've loved every moment
Well done ! James Corden, Well done!

Will miss James.

Is it just me or we were all waiting for other members of the band to jump on the stage and join hazza the whole time?
God I’m so glad it’s over
Great last show! This show saved me thru the pandemic. Can’t wait to see what you’re going to do next! Love from Japan 🇯🇵
Thank you for all the great memories 🫡🫡🫡😭😭😢😢
I miss these The Late Late Show era we spend this day. So long, James Corden. 😢
Love that Seth was in his sweater still. He and Dave know what’s up lol
Thank you James and crew for the last amazing years♥
We will miss you james💕
The voice at the start sounds like Richard Ayoade
I think it's safe to say that they ALL perfectly did their parts for the last 8 years. We'll miss you guys and you deserve all the love you get. Stay safe!❤
Dear James,  your passion, enthusiasm, joy, creativity, sense of humor and especially touching voice every time you sing, you put your heart in it and your eyes had that shiny glittery smile, and it was real -> Thatˋs what Iˋll miss the most. I deeply respect and give credit to your decision to focus on your family and I´m so happy for all of you. You said your favourite topic is love. God is love, you believe in him, let he guide you and your family forever. Settle well in, enjoy life and new projects, laugh and love. Love from Germany to you and all around you in L.A. and U.K. If itˋs raining cats and dogs and youˋre missing the sunshine? In the north of Germany it says this: It doesnˋt rain until the fish swim at eye level. So then, have a nice swim:-) And… Last wednesday I finally (late late) quit my job, too. Thanks, bro ;-)
Fake until the very end.  Have to give him props for his consistency.
See you again James
can someone please explain to me why Harry Styles spat on Chris Pine in the last year or two years ago the awards someone please
Wow, late night talk hosts are literally all straight white old men
Thank you so much for 8 years with late late show ❤️❤️
having Harry Styles as the last guest was perfect and I was sobbing in my bedroom
glad this is over
Thanks people for 8 years ❤😢
Congratulations to the team monitoring the comments, you're doing an amazing job.
When did harry styles become a monk
Thank you so much James, we love you so much❤️❤️
When you're leaving from somewhere and all people remember about are joy, laugh, happiness, and all about positivity, then you can say that YOU DID IT! This is gonna be your legacy, James and team! Thank you for all the dedication into the show. You did it! Have a good rest as much as you need. We'll wait what you're gonna do next, James! Loves!  (Though there is a little thing hold me knowing that 1D reunion wasn't happened)
Please please please stay on that side of the pond, we do NOT want you back!
😢 Farewell James. We send you in love and peace. Come back to America anytime! ❤
Honestly very sad but wishing James all the very best for the future :)
that's exactly how great showmen & -women leave a chapter... I really hope Tucker Carlson watched how greatness and esteem are rewarded.
I was hoping to see Conan
Is this show really ending why why why🥺🥹🥹
Please Harry make it happen.  Yourr the one can make a way.

Thank you so much James for 8 years of such fun! Thank YOU!
I love that they mentioned Ariana Grande for their last episode
We’ll miss you James! I always watched online and you really always put a smile on my face! Please come back! 😢
END OF AN ERA ;(
I can’t imagine this show going offline.
thank you and bye James Corden!
Will Ferrel rocks !!!
Anyone notice the girl faint after fist bumping Harry Styles @17:50 ?
we will miss you guys
❤❤❤❤
thank you for this show❤ this show made me so happy because of the carpool karaokes and segments. will miss it so much. love you james! 💗💗💗💗
This show is part of my childhood and I really sad to see it go😭
I don't cry easily. But damn that last choke up really got to me 😢
Gurl Bye
Sus thumbnail?
Trevor Noah should have left like this !!! friends should have advised him as so … Love this kind of love and energy ————————> but it breaks my heart that Trevor missed such a symbol
Thank you so much for uplaoding the last episode. I'm gonna miss this show so much! Thank you James and the rest of the Late Late Show crew! Good job guys! 👏❤
what's with James Corbin anyway? He's not very good. Good riddance.
I know you will come back on tv doing something else or whenever you are Gonna have a reboot of the show
♥️I drive down Beverly Blvd everyday to go to work at Cedars Sinai and I get to see your big picture on the CBS building ♥️Thank you for the fun car karaoke you had in the show.  We will miss you James 💔💔😭😭♥️♥️
O gosh, James. 😭 I'm literally drowning in tears writing this. There truly has been so many beautiful moments in the show that I'll always remember.☺️ Since I saw your show for the first time, I've wanted to see it live one day.🤩 Go to America and somehow find myself in L.A. so I could see the real American late night show. Well... who did you say was the best host, Will?🤓
Im glad its over. James Corden was a dick to production staff, fans in public, and basically anyone who he saw as lesser than him. This show gave him a false, inflated ego, and im so glad its finally fucking off.
I remember the time that I was so happy that James is on the "Into the woods" musical.
Love you James....we will miss you. Thanks for the laughs. Go be happy 🖤
So many actors
Why did it end?
The song at the end 🥹
Thank you so much James, and thank you totally the team. THANK YOU also for still being in contact with 1D for us <3  we hope to see you again xx
This was a great show and I am happy Harry was there to end it .
So long James you are a very good person to every celebrity in the world and thanks for this show you did for eight years I love you wish you well in the future
This show has helped me get through some tough times in the last 8 years, thank you James and the crew for making me laugh and helping me have a good time. Thank you 🧡
I 🫶 you James. The late late show was one of the bests. You should be proud💗
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Thanks for all the fun, James. Specially during lockdown.
Now that the show is done you can go back to insulting the wait staff at random restaurants
Possible a league of there own special…..
39 minutes of screaming. I couldn't hear a minute of the show😮
Welcome home James Corden  Gavin is waiting for you!!
I was wondering during 3 days "on what channel could I watch The Last Last Late Late IN FRANCE", I found nothing and was so sad.. And I went here today and OMG the episode is online !!!!!  Thank you James for those funny years, those songs, and so much more. We love you !!! That was great to have Harry & Will for the last show 😊  Thank you for everything James ! From France with love 😘
Thanks for giving us some best laughs of our lives James.. Hope you spend more time with your family from now❤
about time this virus is off our screens for good
17.54 Can we talk about the lady that truly fainted after receiving a hand shake from Harry??😂😂😂😆😆😆
thank you james for the eight great years! thank you reggie, hagar, steve, tim, guillermo, ian, rob and all the writers, producers, and crews! you've made a great show. i'm seriously gonna miss this show a lot.
This wasn't really funny 🤔😘
Thank you James. You made us laugh for 8 years. The show was epic and fun. I used to watch it everytime he uploads.. And james was like trying not to cry the entire  show. And james thank you for making me laugh so much and alot of times. And thank you to the band too. I also watched his videos when COVID started because there was nothing to do. This has been an epic journey. Thank you James. 💙☺️
Couldn’t resist watching this as 6am 😭❤️
Thank you James and the entire crew!
Finally
Thank you James Corden and to the Late Late night show team for all the years of fun in such creative 200 shows! Success in your next chapters!!!
James we all will miss you very much!😢I totally understand why you can’t kidnap One Direction but it would’ve been funny I hope you still will be able to bring us entertaining content somehow! ❤❤❤ -The Biggest One D fan
Im not crying, you are crying
Will james tucker and don be doing a collaboration pod cast soon?
17:53 HAHAHAHAHA
Bevis and butthead he wears shoulder pads huhuhhh huhuhhh he eats more cows than your dad
brilliant way to end the show thanks James and the whole crew and team behind the show and thanks to CBS
Keep inspiring James.
Can’t believe this show is ending 😢 thank you to the entire team for the best most incredible 8 years 🎉❤❤❤❤
Marvelous entertainment. Simply marvelous
Thank you for the uploading the full episode of the Last Last Late Late Show 😢 I can't believe it's ending.
Thank you
17:51 did that girl fall over?? 😭😭😭
Of course Harry Styles. Always need one of your own to talk to and understand to get through the show with. No wonder this show is ending.🙄
People at the beginning are just happy that he's leaving
What's a stand-up comedian, and will Corden continue as one one one one?
We heard that he was awful to his staff? I don’t know how that contributed to his demise but I hope he will show up doing something else. I think he is very very talented. He was in a class by himself. Really different than the rest. I wonder why they didn’t move the time slot?
Onya James best of luck to you, Julia and your kids.  Much love from Australia x
Thank you so much for giving us reason to laugh, cry and get emotional. So many emotional stories heard and motivation received. Thank you ! Smiling from India !
Good riddance this guy is evil
This show got me through the scary early days of the pandemic. It is when I discovered James, and he has been an important part of my life ever since through his massive talent. Thank you, sir. Well done. Safe travels. We will miss you here in the US and for our nightly laugh therapy.
another end of an era…. the 8 years have gone by so fast 💙
For all of the Late Late show team; THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALL INCREDIBLE 1200 SHOWS!! Love you and we’ll miss you❤️‍🩹🥹
Will miss ya...
Na na na na. Na na na na. Hey hey hey. Goodbye. Na na na na. Na na na na. Hey hey hey. Goodbye.🎵
thank you
Congratulations to every single person who worked on this show. ❤
My God, I'm crying like a baby!!😢😢😢 Thank you, James and everyone! You and Trevor were the ONLY way I'd watch the news. You made it easy to digest. Everything about this show is pure gold. Enjoy home!  We'll miss you!
yes it is
I’m not even from America but I’m crying so hard 😢 I’m gonna miss waiting for new episodes online. Take care James! It’s been a wonderful 8 years. Sending love from the Philippines ❤️
Thank you so much James and the whole crew for giving us entertainment for the past 8 years! We love you so much! :)
Good riddance?
still waiting for that 1d reunion
There will never be another show like it! Thank you James for the laughs!!
Unparalleled talent and creativity mixed with gobs of humor and boyish mischief.  You were the good friend who we invited to a sleepover at our homes  and who kept us up laughing all night. Your show was a big warm hug during the darkest of times.  We love you James.  You are irreplaceable and late night just lost a little bit of lustre with your departure.  Be well, be safe and continue to be your joyous self.  Walk good.  We will miss you. ❤❤❤❤
I've really enjoyed watching these shows, they've been hugely entertaining & fun, the rapport between James and his team is what makes this show, and why it stands head and shoulders above the other talk shows. Thanks to James & the whole team who have made this show what it is, and I wish James & his family all the best as they return home to the UK.
this is so sad…. james always made me laugh so hard with all his skits and stuff. we will miss u james
Thank you James and crew for 8 amazing and fun filled years that brought joy and light every night  to us all 🙏♥️
"Seek for the light, seek for the joy" you have no idea how i needed to hear this. Thank you James and all the crew for all these fun videos ive been able to watch since 2015, been watching as a Directioner
Thanks James and entire crew for all the moments
This has been my favourite late night show. Thank you so much James.
Why does he have to come back to the UK .  He was a arrogant prick before he went to the US. Just imagine how much of tit he is now.
James alway give us great musical moment  His opening number for the year he host the Tony’s always gets me  And now this closing number r
great show, sorry it's over hello from Belarus❤
The fact that Harry styles was on the last late late show! James and Harry have another level friendship❤️
Such a beautiful episode 😍 gonna miss James Energy 😭😭😭
Why this is over?
I’ll miss you James. Best show!
Bye Felicia.
NOB
Wow, Biden, really!!?? I see why I didn't watch this show.
This is sad😢 we will miss you. Love you so much ❤️
so moving, and so funny in the same time. It have to be James Corden. Thank you from Poland for all what you have done here. All the best!
I love in the beginning where all the employees are clapping and cheering. "Yay! We're all unemployed now!!! Yaaaayyyy!!! Woohoo!!!"
Welcome home James, I just want to se smithy’s and Nessas wedding 🙏 😊❤ 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿
The WF comment about England was difficult to unhear.  I probably need to travel to England to correct my bran after hearing it and I likely won't be able to return.  James is unique.  The crew was amazing. There were things going on that I won't ever understand but I believe James was trying hard to build bridges.  I hope the bridge between England and USA is stronger.
Thankyou for the memories mate
I'm sure CBS will find a great infomercial to replace the Late Late Show.🙂  Great show.  Good job.👍🎉🥳
James, will love you and miss you. Good luck  whatever còme next. 🇬🇧❤
I love the other late shows hosts coming together that was really funny and touching they support him. Why am I crying we love you James your show and carpool got me through some depressed days helping me laugh.
What a farewell show! I hope that UK will offer you another platform. Many thanks to ALL and all the best.
As a regular republican from Kansas.  We are all extremely different but we are all the same. Peace, LOVE not war. Much luv to all!!!
Ian is the best !
thank god its over
Thanks for all the lovely moments James! ❤
shld have played Asking Alexandria's final episode somewhere
Dang, that last song tho.😥😢😓😞😰😨😩😣😫😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I wonder how many people are genuinely so happy that he's finally off the air...
I'll miss it 😢
❤❤❤❤
Late Late Trust Tree  The moment I know your show from a thousand miles away,  YouTube suggest your comedy bit because I'm bored anyway. Been hooked to your sketches in comedy, That I never saw from others even watching the 2 Jimmy's Pandemic hit & crew chimed in Never felt this closeness from within And now the show has ended, I still know that I enjoy it 'til episode twelve hundred. I will miss all of the interviews & sketches, Roll Call, Drop the Mic, & even Steve's news jingles. Ben, Robbe, Ian, Pete & Reggie Hagar, Guillermo, Tim & Winnie Plus who will never forget CBS Senior VP Nick that's a fan of jockey, With all of the gray hair that's bouncy. I know that you never know me personally But I know always that I'm a part of the Late Late Trust Tree  Sending love from your long-time viewer of 7 years in the Philippines
I am actually gonna miss this show, it became a stable for me during the lockdown and after❤️
Gosh Harry needs someone to tell him to sit up straight and not hunch over 😅
I’m gonna miss Harry and James 😢
It’s been a hell of the show, good luck James. From a fan in Thailand.
Thank you James and the entire Late Late Show team for this show. My mornings at work have now lost a little joy. Where else will i get my news now?? :)
I can so relate to the locked code doors. We have the same at work where we occasionally forget codes to various doors. The bit with fellow late night hosts is priceless! Especially with Trevor & James together.
Love ya James well said about the world <3
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Gracias james que te valla bien y   bienvenido a Europa tu casa 😅😅😅😅
Good to see you coming home to the UK for the right reasons James. Let's hope we can get Smithy and Nessa back together for one more show of Gavin and Stacey now you're coming back over here.  To get Joe Biden to say goodbye! It really must mean America took James into their hearts.
The sketch with all the late show presenters was priceless!!!!! :) 😀🤣
I’ve never watched this show, but I am crying
Not gonna lie, I was really hoping this whole "last show" thing was just a very elaborate "April Fools" joke... 😢
We'll miss you dearly pal
Thankyou... for ending it :)
It's a shame that this show is all done and will now live on in YouTube reruns or playlists etc. Thou I do wonder why there's no one out there to take the torch and keep the name going. You have had a Scotsman and an English fella, how about a Aussie ginger like myself, I'm an unknown but aren't we all at one stage, and speaking of stages what a great stage to come and work on. Thou in all seriousness James I first seen you on Dr Who, and you have come along way since then, you done a great job mate cheers for all the laughs etc and all the best to you and your family, and lets see what you do next. Take care mate and all the best cheers. From Neo in Brisbane Australia.
My throat is hurting trying to hold back crying
So hard to watch. Takes a brave person to end the way you did without falling to pieces.  Thank you for the laughs, especially in the hard times. Thank you to all the cast and crew for making it as special as it was. See you on the flip side, wherever that may be.💙💜
17:51  the way she FELL😂😂😂😂
Final?? Ohh no im crying
Thank you 😢❤
miss you😢
Thank you to ALL that helped make this show possible. So much laughter!!!! You're awesome!!!!Good luck James in everything u do!!! Thank u for everything!! 😊
😭😭😭😭
Thank you James 🌹
Why last james we need james show pls
This was a amazing 8 years i hope you are happy and im gonne miss you ❤
Bye 😢
Is it just me or is harry coughing a lot? Is he sick? 🥺
Any body else see the girl faint after fistbumping Harry 🤣🤣🤣 hope shes alright
Late to the late late show
James is a horrible human why do people still believe that he's anything like his character
If Late Late Show could have invited Conan on the skit it would be even more perfect for the audience and even James ❤ Goodbye my friend.
The fact that I have to wait to get home from school to watch this 😭
Thank you James for everything ❤❤❤ Love you always and miss you sooo much  I’m crying rn ‘cause you were there in my hardest times ❤
Miss you and your show.. My mom is a huge fan of yours ❤
Thank you so much James for everything. Been watching you for years. All the guest you’ve had on your show making it funny with your amazing sense of humour. Will miss the Late Late Show so much 🤍
I'm french, I live in France, the piano ending sequence made me cry. I'm a fan of the late, late late, and other american talk show, and this last late late show is the end of an era that i started loving from Craig Ferguson shows. I think CBS won't be the same without a late late show 😢
I can't imagine my weekdays without watching clips from the show the night before. I can't imagine not getting the life updates after a weekend. The sarcasm, the pure joy, the laughter, the dialogue.... the community. I wish you all the very best. The late late show with James Corden will truly be missed
Please, America, keep him. We don’t want him back! Thanks 🇬🇧
😪😪😪
This is the honest vulnerability we needed, and it’s coming from a Brit! Well, done, sir! We will miss you more than you know. It’ll be impossible to fill the hole your absence will make, but we support you with all the awe, pride, & love. ❤️ 🤗 👋
James Corden is like the bad guy off this show.
High Wycombe memories, are going home 😢
thank you for this fun show !!!
I guess they had to pretend everyone loves him for his last show 😂
this show literally grew up with me and im so proud that harry is the last guest on the show. Really shows how great their friendship is
Yeah stay in America mush
Even, Harry said things about One Direction, and I love them, I feel, it was James' time, for the last to shine in his own show. love it
thank you!! <3 :,)
No more show?
HARRYYYY
17:51 did that girl fainted,,,,?👀🛌
Great end to a good run God's speed James
This is one show I will miss, Carpool Karoke was the best & inspirational and fun to watch.
Thanks for making this available. I'm going to really miss this show.  I hope he has a great future. He should know it's his genuine kindness and honesty that many of us love not that he doesn't also have immense talent. He's  a really likable person and I hopevhe stays that way.
Thank you James and the entire crew. You got us through COVID, you embraced the whole team and introduced us to them all. The only show that included the whole crew in its shows.. we will ms\iss each and every one of you xo
Why this show is finsl show? Who is make a decision why don't you ask us? 😢😢😢😢😭😭😭
no one cares😅😊
Hi Mate!!  Terrible times with the door yeah?? The accent!!😂😂😂
it was the saddest goodbye ever, but also it was the best goodbye. I hope James will doing well after the show is ended now, and he'll have a great great time
I started watching this show very recently like at the start of pandemic and now I am so emotional that it is ending. It's just showes how much attached I became to this show which has been such a joy and has never been been so political like the other late late show and has always been about music and things that anyone would enjoy. 😢😭  P. S.  I wish James all the best for the new chapter in his life.
Ill definitely miss James a lot🫂🫂 the show was amazing thanks for everything ✨✨✨✨
LMFAO Nah mah nah nah NAH NAH NAH NAH HEY HEY HEYYYY GOODBYE! To the worst host on Television even Steven Seagal was a better host
Jame ❤ the family a lot he is good man . Thank you Jame for laughing and enjoying. Time ago  I saw jame begin again on movie 🍿
A dynasty comes to a close. We will miss you James🫡
James Corden is a living legend !!
Thank you James and crew! I Will miss this show and the laughs.
Was Really hoping a 1D reunion yet here we are...... But I'm happy for James and I'm never ever gonna forget this show !!! I've watched it for almost 3 years and I'm really gonna miss it !!! Will always love The Late Late Show With James Corden ❤️
Really sad reaching this day.  Past 10 years my life has been empty but your show got me through most of the time, which unfortunately will still last for not sure how long without your show. But I will take this ending to encourage myself also ending my emptiness. Thank you and will forever miss your show.
Melancholia  /ˌmɛlənˈkəʊlɪə/ noun  Characterized especially by profound sadness and despair  Example: • Last episode of Seinfeld  • Last episode of Late show with d.Letterman  • Last episode of Friends  • Last episode of The Late Late show with j.Corden
Aaaa!!! Finally the END!!! Damnn!! Thanks a lot James and entire Late Late show crew❤for each and every carpool karaoke,  take a break, spill your guts, crosswalk concert and many many many more❤❤❤  A big hug❤🫂
Ok, can we have Craig back now?
Thanks for 8 great years 😢
good riddance
Gonna miss this! Thank you James for everything. 🥲❤
You can tell on everyone’s face they secretly think he is an asshole
I’m missing you already ❤
I always wished his show would begin at 13pm to be honest.
well… no One Direction reunion
A bit over the top maybe.... The guy left a job after 8 years where he host a tv show that was on in the night and he thinks he's Elvis who is leaving the building.
Thank God, please don't ever show your face again
Fucking thanks james
I'll miss this show.. This show really has been so special and i'll always have a place for it in my heart :/❤️
Great show and I think James corden is great. All the best for the future
Nothing lost....😂😂
✨💫Dearest James and the Late Late Show Band/Cast/Crew,  What a legacy of a show. So much brilliance and creativity. The final week has been bittersweet and immense fun. Full of giggles and tears. Pat yourselves on the backs for the all of the joy & happiness you’ve brought the world over for eight years, which won’t ever feel long enough, but it’s absolutely the right decision with children at those ages. Time with the grands and rest of your family is also precious and will go by in a blur. It’s the best of both worlds. It’s a blessing they’ll grow and experience GB as you and your family did at their age.  Might I add, so many amazing skits this week. The finale dream sequence was SO GOOD!!! You all brought your own unique style and gifts to late (late) night and we are forever in love and grateful for the eight treasured years. Thank you, ALL for the beloved memories. Always loved and missed. Cheers, mates 🥂🎭 🇺🇸❤️🇬🇧 🎊💫✨
Harry Styles telling James that he’s his safe space had me in _TEARS._ He really values the people he loves and is closer with. Harry’s my safe space 🥹🤍
The way he moved his leg and licked his lips at hearing it was bulls penis lol😂
i remember when all of this started when this chancel had 100k subscribers 😭 what a ride it has been
Can't lie I was waiting for conan in the bedroom when they mentioned podcast.  Just think 15 years ago 10 years ago this kind of late night love never happened
We’ll miss you James. No reunion, we were just clowning
Ooh that's where Joe biden has been  too busy with James Corden  I know it's his last show but I thought he would of had more important things to do
What an unfunny twat! Good riddance! 😂
Thank god its ending. Can't stand James Corden and his fake persona.  Absolute prick in real life.
This is the first full episode I watched… I only liked Carpool Karaoke… But this was adorable  Good luck across the Pond. ❤
Wow thank you so much for uploading the full episode here. Perfect thank you to your YouTube fans 😍🙌 Your lockdown shows were the highlight of my days and made it just a bit more tolerable
Amazing guy. Amazing show ❤ you made the right decision for you - no regrets. We love you  This mans such a sensation and i love everything he has done for us when stuck during hard times 😭❤ bless you kind soul Even from today, i will always watch your show!
I read so many negative comments on Facebook about James from British and Americans alike. He seems like a nice guy… Why so much hate?
Very mixed emotions of smile and frown, but Best of Luck for your next carrier James Corden, I'm quite sure you won't be unemployed, Maybe! its time for Investing into podcasts. mate(british accent)..Just like Conan o'brien.
I miss him already!!!
We all gonna miss you so much :(
Jame and the crew, thanks for 8 years of great belly hurting laughs 😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤.  God’s speed and all the best on your next adventure 🎉
So sad this is the last. I’m going to miss this show so much. Thank you for a great show❤  and wishing everyone all the best!   Also I love that will Ferrel’s thing now is to appear at the last episode of late night shows 😂
We Will miss you a lot... Anyway, i do agree with you... Family first. Green from Chile 🖖😍👍🇨🇱
😢 this show will surely be missed ❤
Not my favourite show but the finale was perfection.
i love you James and i’ll miss you so much
I thought The ominous sound at the beginning was Britney Spears's "Oops! I Did It Again"
Hugs and kisses James......you made singing along and out loud so much fun  - I don't get life .. --- the foibles of popular opinion .... I will miss you... --- from Australia....
Love it... fab James and your team and everything! ♡
I'm gonna miss watching the late late show with you, James..
Never watched a single show of James live, but I respect his work and The Final Show was well done.
Gonna miss this show so much💔
It’s the masked singer part for me
一つの映画作品を観ているような、感動の最終回でした😭😭😭 『自分はこのショーの一部であって、多くのスタッフがいてこのショーが成り立っているんだ』って…本当に素晴らしい言葉でした👏  周りの沢山の人の支えがあって、その結果として8年後の今があって、関わってきた全ての人に感謝の気持ちを伝えたジェームスはカッコ良すぎです。  お疲れ様でした。 そして笑いと感動をありがとう！
It was an incredible journey. It really was. ❤️
WMAMWMAMSKIDSKODSOKDSKLDD
Thank you, James and the entire Team ♥️ I remember starting to watch this show because of the guests and how fun the interviews were, yet I stayed for the essence of this show, that is nothing but positivity and kindness. I hope life treats you beautifully, James. Thank you for the company.  Love from Portugal.
WE LOVE U GUYS!!
Cancel culture really sucks.
I didn't know Harry Styles was Australian!? 😉
Ohh I'll miss you soooo much 😭😭😭😭
Love the late late show and the carpool karaoke!!! We will miss you so much. Safe travels home!
I cried so much cuz I really thought we will get one direction reunion but It hurted me even more cuz I know we wont get it...I still belive in one direction any desision they will make I love them and I just wish they are happy cuz they deserve a world💚💙🇮🇪💛❤️
wasted question on harry smh
Too bad James got to this point. It shouldn’t have been this way.
Thank You James!
Thank you for everything James Cordon I haven’t watched you a lot in all fairness but you are truly great and inspiring have fun in retirement in london and wherever you will go!
Thank you for the many years of laughs. James and the entire crew. Best wishes for the next chapter 💙
We'll miss you, James. Thank you for all these years, for the countless smiles and laughs, and for all the beautiful memories. We are all so incredibly proud of you. Love you so much! Take care <3
The come back from his mum trying to make him cry 😢😢😢😢
Thank god he left the show after craig ferguson leaving the late late show the show was never the same.
So we all did clown for no reason 😔😔😔
Please tell Ian, that he is Welcome to return to Portland! and besides, the Blazers could really use all the Inspiration available! Of course, Talking Ball & that whole Blazer network is gone now, sigh, but hey, come on back anyhoo! And James, BEST on your return Home, you are getting the H out of this insanity just in time, i fear!
Thank you James for everything! I was so emotional while watching 🥹You’re my favorite host and always will be
Funny harry came out and the girls melted jaja…will comes out and the same girls that melted didn’t give a shit for will jajajaj…we all from the 80’s melted for will jajajajaj
Quote: "I am unprankable." (different video).   The im- Port - dance of Unprankability, before 1:53.    One randomly fixed (standstilled, "framed") gesture to my mind is indicating some shoving "my" hands into the pockets of my "jacket"/trousers, might form a fist. Seems Corden is willing to play that situation of door is locked - just through. Makes me think about the ending of his personal carreer, his role in the format of "talk". Because there is frame shifting in the "shows". After several years frame shifting becomes shifting of gears, thus "un-meta", and not really funny any more (Adele takes of her hands from the steering wheel. cp. Powell: We did not play by the rules). I think I will be able to think that over. In principle, there might be different "ways" to get out of being framed ("boeing"), which Corden might never term "been abused". No - just been in a making of a  Mr. Bean.  To compare with Ed Sheeran, of whom I watched a video titled: how Sheeran broke off on an interview: "I am not gonna let you/me (for a guy like me: it's a question: let me abuse me...cp. Robbie Williams: let me entertain you)  abuse me - just because...". Such talk might be named thinking out loud - and acting, both within a set, a stage, a situation that has been given, but that is live. Ed Sheeran, to me, stands alone, right, concerts are the guitar and me, inviting a friend - Corden did last exit with Adele. Adele to me stands for the dialogue that never is "directed" to the single person "uttering" random thoughts, but thinking is in dialogue, no one thinks to himself, only fools or crazy people do that, they should stick to their roomings  - that's what I do, who's counting words -- but always sees the audience that might be torn apart by what you say or do. You might think it over what you are up to not to "ruin everything" (when Lennon said Winston Churchill) or, thinking, at all, it's a quality, may make you a leader and a dare devil. Corden as a "master" might have induldged in that too much. If you connect the single mind in a circle of set theory to the highest skies, you're not even master of puppets - "you should" - but master of the universe which doesn't make very much laughable sense as it might, after a row of session become too serious: too childisch. If there is a torch to hand over to Styles, that might be a growing up with some.  The "door issue"  was able to make me laugh in the end. Not any specific moment. "The whole thing" with the appearance of Harry's face (gosh: Can he face-imitate people? Or express words or letters using eyes, brows and hairs?) and him actually humanitily "talking" to or with Corden the situation, the real thing, got really real, not even sur-real. Because: why does a knight like Corden hit the buttons? There must be reasons.   P.S. I swear I haven't heard the word "jacket" being said later on. I guess in my randomly chosen point in time-line that was some premeditaded (well-written) or masterly set "fore shadowing". Any pro may tell me. It's about the pockets indicated visually, and the word "jacket" being heard uh later on. :-) rotfl  Great shows! So sad, so to say.
You will all be missed😢❤
First, I'd like to say I have never related to anyone more than the woman who fell over after receiving a Harry fistbump.  We're really gonna miss you, James!!! Thank you for 8 years of laughter, love, and light. Can't wait to see what you do next! 💙💙💙💙💙💙
About god dam time. This guy  is just as bad as Stephen, jimmy and all the other so called "funny" guys.
Good Riddance!! Don't come back to England stay in Yankee land!!!
Thank you, What an amazing journey it is and all the wonderful memories you passed along.
Thank you James for everything. A chapter of my life comes to an end. It felt like you and us audience were cheerleaders of one another. It will take time for us to fathom that The Late Late Show wont be aired anymore, but we'll bite that bullet for your happiness. Keep entertaining us in whichever way possible. Have a great ride back home. Thanxx again James. Lots of love and admiration from a boy from India dreaming to be able to spread love like you.
NOOOO
Millions of British citizens are now throwing their TV's away, it's just not worth the risk.
I'm so gutted that he's coming back to the UK.  We don't want the prick 😂
good riddance corden
Well done smiffy👍
🥲🥲🥲💕💕💕💕🫂🫂🫂
I will miss this show 😢 Feels like saying goodbye to a lot of good friends. This team really was more creative with all their segments than any other late show. Well done team 👍🏻
Biden: WTF man, I  have been here for two years and you forget.
I'LL  MISS YOU....
I should start watching this show. This guy's pretty good. Stoked for what he comes up with next week.
God I’ve been watching this show since I was 14 and I am almost 23 now I love this show so much 😢😢😢. You have been an amazing host James and good luck for the future bro Love from Australia 🇦🇺
James I’m so sad :(
The show has been amazing and i really loved it
Harry fans understood the banana masked singer …I am glad to be here 😂😂
Amazing thank you speach amazing show amazing
I MISS YOUR 💋 KISSES AT THE CAMERA 📷.....NICHOLA B.PRINCE ALVES....THANK YOU FOR LIFE......
Certainly can sing but hey he wasn't playing that piano 🙃
Wow end of an era huh this show was lit.
What an incredible show that was, I have never heard truer heartfelt words than james thanking everyone for making him the person he has become. Never once did he try and put himself on a pedastal. Eight years of pure entertainment and I look forward to seeing what he does with the rest of his life and of course enjoying rewatching the shows again. Hopefully all the crew can continue the success they have made with james and enjoy themselves in the new direction they are heading
Xo to all the good times you and the team provided for so many nights ❤ Many blessings to you and yours 💝
Something about loosing something pure, is very sad. Everything is woke nowadays Where's the innocence
Apart from Stephen Colbert and his dancing vaccine syringes this has to have been the worst TV ever.
Final Show ... Hilarious!
Thanks for all the entertainment my dude !! Enjoy your time off and on to the next !! ❤
Happy 4 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
At the end of the Masked Singer bit, I thought James and Trevor Noah would look at each other and say, "We made a terrible mistake!"
Im sitting here 😭 this was magnificent, every moment🎉damn he'll be missed😢❤
Thank you for this show, I can’t even begin to count the amount of times I’ve had a shit day and gone back thru these videos and laughed my guts out, sad to see it leaving ❤
Brilliant last show!!!
we are more the same, than we are different.........amen to that.
You'll be missed james, Good luck for your upcoming endeavours buddy, the best show host, thank you
I Hate Goodbyes😔
current mood: sobbing
💙💜🧡💚💗💛🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
Wonder why people dislike him ?
Plesse become a better person, James
First and last comment!
James Corden is def one of the best host always made his audience and guests comfortable.
BURST IN TEARS!
Last Show 😳 this must be fake news 🤔
Corden a douchebag. feel for all the staff losing their jobs tho
Who is replacing this putz?
NOOOOOOOO!!! Don't leave us, we'll never make it through this next election without your humor James and crew. We love you!!   Come back James...Come back.....  (This rREALLY sucks, James Corden's bits are the greatest all time Late Talk Show show bits)  How else would I ever have gotten to see Jin og BTS being carried by Ashton Kutcher when they all played Hide N Seek on the show & JK got behind a camera & fooled them all by standing there operating the camera.. Car Pool Karaoke, every single one of those is LEHENDARY, Paul McCartney, Bruno Mars, Red Hot Chili Peppers, carrying Ariane piggyback, Adele, Mariah, One Direction he must've met every one of my most favorite celebrities/artists/actors etc.. ROLE  CALL too, SO GREAT! There was Samuel L Jackson, Tom Cruise and so many more.....this show should have NEVER ended.)
I am tearing up , thanks James and the entire crew for making such an incredible show that has become an irreplaceable part of not only yours but also our lives . p.s you were , are and always will be my fav late night host <3
James thinks he's better than everyone else since doing this show his attitude stinks to normal people and you all treat him like your hero and God get over yourselfs.
Don’t blame him for going back to the UK, the US is cooked
I’m crying so much stop 😭😭😭
the need to let ian host his own show 😢
Mahalo Mr. James Corden for great eight years! ALOHA! Have a great life! :)
Bravo to the Late Late Show and Thank you for entertaining us 🎉🎉🎉
We love you James. So sad the show has ended. Looking forward to seeing you on a new adventure. Thanks for being my safe space to laugh and experiencing joy. You are a gem. Blessings to you and your family. Sending love from Nigeria 🇳🇬❤️❤️
Only found this show during Covid, you guys seemed to have so much fun and so many laughs. Really loved the clips I went back and watched of old episodes. Gonna miss this show
He has very little time for Waite Staff why would he have to act so like this in the "Stairwell" ? . Who is his replacement ???
Wtf is Harry wearing? Isn’t he mean to have good stylists
I totally agree with the president joe Biden!💜🫶🏻!!
Everyone in Britain despises this man, fake laughter, fake tears but a real piece of work. Hopefully never heard from again.
yass harry wearing orange for kingsday in the netherlands, so true😌🧡
Good riddance to Corden. Hopefully now he can get a reality check and treat people with some respect. Pathetic man.
I’m so incredibly sad. You gave us a lot of joy James, we will miss you.
Why Will Ferrell?
About time
We want whole interview of Harry where he talk about Grammy, james upload that
Harry Styles and his Hollyweird friends....great
Thank you ❤
I enjoyed him brings joy to the screen.
I can’t begin to say how much I enjoyed watching this show, all the carpools and spill your guts juts barely scratched the surface on an incredible show this was, I hate that I cried watching the end of that but congrats James on the next chapter in your life buddy! ❤😎
Will Farell is an absolute legend
He is so fake
Diva James is off to the island again...a lot of staff will be glad!
Thank god that's over.
I know you tried to push away the tough parts, we are all the sum of Sunshine, Optimists Keep shine light into the dark James, and don't let them dim your light!
Thank you to James and his entire team for making this my favorite late late show to watch! Its fun, entertaining and joyful! You can always get a laugh no matter what I cant believe that its over but I'm happy that James and everyone will have a break. Also I love that Harry Styles and Will Ferrell are the last to be on the show. I could not ask any better guests! I appreciate you James and love you!
MOM AND DAD BON VOYAGE......HOPE TO KEEP HEARING FROM YOU GUYS 😢......
Whatever you think of James, he always tries to simply entertain. In a world of cynicism and pointless division, driven by power and money over human life, it is nice to have a TV show of joy. Best of luck James.
Watching this from Germany, having known you from your British beginnings, always have loved your way of entertaining. Thank you for your ideas, and for your love for your job. Wishing you all the best for your next endeavours.
Honestly, what's the real reason he's leaving? Anybody?
I cried before I started watching. Didn't want to click this. Thank you James, you have been amazing, funny, inspiring. Thank you for lighting our lives
Thank you! From Portugal
Never liked him glad his show is over
Please James Corden, Reunite One Direction before retiring. Please 🥺🙏
I’ll miss this show.. it was more fun than other late night talk shows
♥️♥️♥️♥️
thanks James and crew! 8 years come and gone too quick with lots of laughs and awesome moments. maybe we'll see you on that cruise ship one day.
The dream of being in James show as a guest will going to be a dream forever.
About time, his show should've ended years ago.
You have been a delight! Thank you! I wish you the very best.
Why is it ending??
Will Ferrell brought is wife, that's nice to see
Why the show has come to an end ??
Thank you James!
17:52 that lady will never be the same after a Harry Styles fist bump.
there was hope for a one direction reunion at the last show but no
Yay, Mr President! :)
Where is the writer that often perform in the skit?
Please don't go away. "All we need is love"... Love and laughter. Thank U for the Show, thanks to U and all the staff.
Please get a bus and put all the singers you can in it. That should be the last carpool karaoke
DON'T  LEAVE PLZ 😊😢
Now that's what I call "The Special Relationship!"    James is right. Despite its manifest issues the USA has always been seen by us in the UK and elsewhere as a place of deep joy and optimism.   Who would the free world choose as a superpower?  China, or the one that gave us Anchorman 2 and the Simpsons!
O man it was truly an and of an era
😅😅 Stunned 😮😮 wut happened?
Class act of an exit.
IM NOT CRYING
I'm sorry to piss on the parade, but when he buggered-off to the States there wasn't a person in the UK who was sorry to see him go. I live in London - and now he's coming back. Sod it!
A little bit dramatic . . .
Thank You from Canada 🇨🇦 James, we will miss you too eh! 🇨🇦🐢❤️🙌👏🏻🙏🏻
Oh boy I cried a lot!! James Corden and so humble to a great show and the wonderful team crew!  We are going to miss you. 😢😢😢
all men so far.  oh gosh
not the table smashing 🤣
it was great, yeah. But he also could’ve kidnapped one direction and solve all of my life problems 🥹🥹
That was a good ending
we love you james!
We’ll miss everyone SO much!!!!!! Thank you for ALL the laughs James & crew!!!!!
Oh my! I am watching this show on youtube for years now! Thanks so much for all the love, joy and authenticity, for being real and ALIVE. Wish you all all the best and James, keep wearing your soul inside out. It is so fucking inspiring, thank you 🙏🏼❤️🤩
Good Riddance.
thank god! no more left wing nut promoting mainstream media NPC talking points.
CONGRATULATIONS 🎉😢......I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO.....I WILL MISS YOU  DEARLY AND 😅 ❤...ALLTHE CAR POOL SINGING....NICHOLA B.PRINCE ALVES WILL MISS U..
Who's taking his place for late late night TV?
Thank you James and crew for all you have taught and given us. The President absolutely said it best. May God Bless you and your family eternally..
Dude but why did u have to make me cry ? Not cool. Later James Kimberly ✌🏼😤 thx for ur time. Enjoy the rest.
So many future unemployed people on his show. I hope they find jobs! I'm not a fan of James at all. I know his work visa expired.  So off to England you go.
Bye
Thank you James for the countless hours of humour, laughs, songs and entertainment, we will forever love you and I wish you the best for what's to come for you. I loved your final guests (I'm a massive harry fan) and we will forever remember this show. Much love ❤️💕🇦🇺
lmao ive never seen so many fake smiles (they all hate him)
I really enjoyed the last show😢I'm going to miss James Corden.Late Late Show will never be the same. Thank you James 4 the wonderful years you gave us. Great choice getting @Tom Cruise 😢😢 #Hugs Wishing you the Best!!
This was such a great show! James Corden such an amazing talent, as proven to the very end! Hope we will see you again doing something just as fantastic! Thank you for the many years not only to James but also the crew that was there thru the journey! Safe travels home!❤
One of the best talk shows ever, love you
James scared me. Because it dawned on me, he is leaving because he is afraid there may be a revolution.  And I think we are a very scary place to be.
Thanks for sharing the entire last episode. Truly enjoyed this show. ♥️ Thanks so much the entertainment!
Please don’t leave us forever james 😢 you brought so much fun and laughter into our lives thank you!
Gonna miss this so much 🥺❤️ Thank you for everything
I'm already so sad & shedding tears about this beautiful entertaining chaos being over but understand nothing lasts forever & being there for your ageing family is the most important thing in this life. I want to thank every single person in front & behind the cameras for all their hard work & dedication over the past 8 years to produce a unique great late night show that changed the landscape for the better.. wishing success & great health to everyone & the best in their future endeavours!!!!!!!!!!!!! Love you all!!!!
Thank you James!
Now you are part of my COVID coping archive history😢... Quite a tribute to you, and I want to thank you for helping me quite a bit. Laughter is the best medicine. Thanks Doc!
Ahhh I'm so sad The Late Late Show is ending❤❤I loved it so so much❤
thank you for an amazing 8 years
I'm ganna miss carpool karaoke
I have to admit I was bitter when Craig Ferguson left the late late show and didn't watch for a while after but here and there I would catch it on and tune in live. Fell in love instantly of course! Even though most of my views have been here on YouTube I'm glad to say James Cordens late late show became a part of my "catch up on clips" routine . Wish you well James Corden and thank you for all of the laughs! You will be missed! 💙 I can also say I've had the privilege of watching David Letterman's, Craig Ferguson's and James Cordens very last show live!
Iam gonna miss u james, u make ma day huhu 💗
James We say Thank you 😭🤗
Oh and I hope you and Tom Cruise do a movie together 😁😃👍
Cannot wait for Limmy to see this!
How does he manage to walk past so many people and not one of them smashes him full in the face?
Well done, mate.  As a fellow 1978 baby, it's awesome to see what you've accomplished and for putting family first.
😢❤
Excellent Stuff Excellent SHOW 👏
Fins up !
Good riddance frankly, nobody in the UK wants him back as he can't act and he's not funny.
Thank you James Corden for 8 years of AWESOME 👍 we love ya. ❤️
James parents are so adorable ❤
What a beautiful ending 🤧 thank you James and every single person who made this show one of a kind! I'll always cherish it. I can't believe it has been 8 years. It truly felt like yesterday. And I'll always love the crosswalk musicals and carpool karaoke! The last one with Adele was very emotional 😭 Thank you James for all of the laughs and great times! I'll always love this show ❤️
Love me love me love me!!!!
You all will be missed, nightly from now on. God bless. Such a great show will go down in history
Thank you James, for making me laugh everytime

the late late show and he coming in "late" was very clever writing😁
Goodbye james❤
thank you. merci. thank you from trinidad and tobago and the caribbean
Of course there’s gonna be a 1d reunion
Excellent, respected talented, wishing all the Best! Thank you, you will be missed😥😥😥💕💕💕
Pure class
😢❤
The show that got us through COVID and other great times. I will miss it!! Good Luck JAMES I will pray 🙏 for your future.😢
I'm so glad they posted this omg
thank god
I never heard of the late late show, or James Corden......The guy across the street with the red hair wrote off his Camaro last week, and his girlfriend threw all his stuff on the lawn yesterday.....There's always crazy stuff goin on over there......( She's really pretty, and he's got a face like a boot,.....you gotta wonder....)
That was a joy but also so hard to watch. I will miss you James Corden. Your humour and diverse talent is truly spectacular. FYI, I think London streets are perfect for a bit of UK carpool karaoke. Keep that flame burning 🔥 ✨💕
Amazing last speech. Especially for a dude from the old continent. 🤣
Rest in peace ✌️
Hope James will start new show in British ,so miss him show from now on.
We are gonna miss you Johnny
17:52 GWORL, SAME !!! I KNOW 😭
Will Ferrell: The man there when you leave a show.
Dear Mr Corden and Dear Late Late Team, I will miss you, so much. Thank you for making my everyday a happy day. Fair winds and following waves, Jacques from Belgium, XXXX
watching you gave me some of the best moments in my life. Thank you James!
Will miss the show 😭🥺❤️
My only favorite show out of all of them, and it's ending :(  Ffs now I'm stuck with Jimmy Fallon and Jimmy Kimmel show for the rest of my life :(( Will miss your show, James. Thank you for making me happy.
Not soon enough, the arrogant prik…
Thank christ its over!
El humor inglés💖

Cringey fake
I'm new to You Tube, and this is the first late late James Corden show I've seen! WOW this guys good right! I'll spend the rest of the month catching up - good luck James! 🎉🎉🎉
Will miss this show and you James 🥹❤️ you’ve done nothing but make us proud and laugh all these years. You’ve been the best and always will be
Thank you James for the laughs
like.
James, I’m so pissed you’re leaving the show. I hope you step on a Lego with bare feet and someone poor’s glitter over the curtain on you when you shower! 🤬😡😈💩  I started late watching your show, but the moment I did, I couldn’t stop. BRAVO 🙌 You are so special!
Somebody explain to me, how did he go from gavin and Stacy to the late late show
Never thought I would get attached to a show like this... Dangg am gonna miss you guys 😢all the very best every one of you ❤❤❤❤
Thank you James and the team!!! End of an era😭
enjoy the time with the kids !
got to see Limmy tear that intro apart
so happy this shit show is over
Thank you James 💙
So ... now the true question. When does Craig Ferguson get a new late night show?
Great last show. As a fellow brit I must say you are one of our best exports and on my evening commute through your home town of High Wycombe tonight I will raise a glass to you :)
you don't realize the amount of practice it took Biden to say that big prop
Interesting to see all the people pretend to like James Corden
We will always love you James
Thank you James, and the rest of the crew for getting me through the hard parts of life, and making me feel less alone ❤
Conan was missing 😊😊😊
For God's sake, go to bed.  Look at what time it is
give me a thumbs up if you like James Corden for President?
Wooow this is really the end, thank you to the entire team for bringing so much joy to our lives, thank you James for 8 great years can't wait for what you do next. This is the only show that has ever made me spit my drink, you guys were straight up funny. Thank you, God bless you and all the best in what comes next ❤
Original and terrific😀
I’ve always enjoyed watching this show, but im genuinely curious why there’s a lot of people out there who hates James?
This show sucked.
James, we love you so much!!!!
Will miss this people terribly! This show got me through a lot in the last years. I hope America heard his message loud and clear… we need to look towards the light, we are all more alike than different. Thank you for all the laughter! ❤
It's been an amazing company for me and lot of fun even when I was in a dark place I still could have a good laugh. So thanks for the show. Love from Italy. ❤️
❤
I've watched this show for years from Uganda, East Africa. Can't deny that I also expected a 1D reunion but Harry Styles is also a vibe. I've loved this episode, especially the one part where the fellow late night hosts scare the hell out of James. Congratulations James. I wish you the best in your next endeavors. Love from Uganda ❤️
Congrata to all the abused/mistreated writers and employees, hope you get on to better things!
well done. thank you guys for everything o7
Thought we were gonna get One direction reunion... "Im Crying in a cool way" Thank you James for giving us a lot 1D memories. ..
He can now afford to come home, he will soon regret that !!
Never watched one episode and il keep it that way
Spill ur guts or fill ur guts, guessing brit or american, guessing ppls height and jobs, late night tinder, emoji news and asking ppl about the late late show are my fav bits of this show im gonna miss that and im gonna rewatch them as i did before, so funny and enjoyable, im gonna miss this show
Several years ago I began to see this program as a homework to improve English, it is my favorite program for a long time. Thank you James and the entire team for brightening my days and making me feel at home, you were my motivation to keep going. I wish you all the best.
This literally made me shed tears this show will be missed
Harrrrryyyyyy❤❤❤
Bravo!
🥰❤🧡💛
Oh well, the world will survive.
❤❤❤
Where’s Conan? Not even Craig?
What a cultural staple it was, thanks for the show!
We miss you so much James, Thank you for all those moments, love you💖✨️✨️
thanks for uploading the whole show for your international fans ❤
It’s been an honour james!
What a great last show, i cried for most of the time. Thank you!!
I didnt cry You are crying 😢 thank you james.... for the incredible 8years, what a journey 🥺🥺 Edit: James you really have a good vocal❤
Thank you so much James Corden for everything you’ve given us with this show and platform. You brought laughter, joy, happiness, and most importantly togetherness, to everyone who has watched your show. You are always welcomed and invited to our homes.
What a passion, what a love 🫶🏻. We will miss you 😘
This is it !
So sad to see you go❤
From New Zealand.....Thank you James, best wishes for the future projects...always loved your show...cheers
Thank god its ending  i hope we never see carpool karaoke again with your annoying face
It was supposed to be one direction 😭😭😭😭 u did good James but it was supposed to be harry, Niall, Liam, louis and zayn
Show was fun while it lasted!  I'm fine as long as The Graham Norton Show goes on, one of best talk show host ever and most probably the best in the UK(at least for me) 👏
this show really has been so special i’ll always and forever have a place for it in my heart
I saw this live. Best show on TV.
It's Over ,Great..I don't think he's funny or relevent.. when he has other British people on his show, his accent gets THICKER and its annoying.. Thank god, I like this..
Thanks James Corden for all the years!!! Cheers!!
Farewell James, let's get Ariana if you are doing another surprise one lol
You will not be missed✌️😂
I love this show and late night television. Nonetheless, when you put them all together, we can clearly see that late night has a diversity issue. Yes it's sensitive and you can avoid it all you want to, but these are all network choices and networks have chosen to put straight white men in the seat for decades now. Boy, you guys are going to hate it when things change.
James is a real one ❤
Good riddance
Thank you so much for the wonderful years ❤
Harry Styles is just beautiful! Bye James!
❤ Thank You James !
We will all miss you dearly, James and your beautiful show, that brings so much light! ❤❤❤❤
Gonna miss you James thank you for all the laughter and joy you have given the world.. Love from Malaysia 🥰
Gobshite
❤❤❤
With power comes great responsibility.   Some people can handle it.  Some goes to their head.  A very funny guy.  They will probably offer him a show in England.   Hopefully he learns from this. Wyndmoor PA
The platform vans I’m dying
I thought this creep was cancelled?
Did that girl faint ar the beginning after getting fist bump from Harry? :D
Thanks James for making me laugh
If james waant a mean prick in real life this wouldve kept going
legend. i'm proud of you.
James welcome home buddy I truly hope you decide to do something like this on prime time TV back in Blighty. Inspiring hilarious musical genius (Reggie) and fun to watch back in the UK. One of our best ever exports
thank you james and the all crew❤❤❤
It’s now written in the memory lane
This Show with James corden Never Ends It will be Always Running in Heart
I agree...Will Ferrell is objectively more talented in general and within his field.
Dam...
What will he do? A show in uk?
We're gonna miss you james 😢
They didn't get Conan for the bit?!
I hope he starts a new show in England like Graham Norton ❤
That desk showed all the strenght an build quality of a tipical American house.
I remember becoming a fan of Harry and 1D after they split up, all the videos I’d watched of them from the late late show will always be close in my heart and it’s so heart breaking that if there ever is a reunion James won’t be a part of it💔
Please look after everyones mental health!
It was nice to see harry but God you can so tell harry is bisexual😂 look at that awful outfit hes wearing 😂 good final show james looking forward to welcoming you home to the uk and looking foward to your future projects
Thank you Mr. corden for a really fun show And I agree with you I get out of dodge 2 if I could.
Fuck sake, he's not coming back to Britain is he??
That's how a ERA ends 😢 thank u Mr. Corden!
We’re gonna miss you James, thankyou so much for always putting a smile on our faces in each episode❤️
I would say back to the UK buddy but i respect them too much
late night hosts getting together to do a bit , really funny bit , keep up with your good work guys
Everyone celebrating he is leaving at the start….so they don’t have to put up with him any more…
love you James ❤️❤️ we will miss you so so so much 💋💋 You brought me so much joy so much happiness everyday ❤️❤️ I’ll miss you so so so so much! I was crying most of the the time 😭 but don’t be a stranger 🫵🫵🫵
This was so emotional to watch Thank you for putting a smile on our faces for the past 8 years James I will really miss you❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤💚💙💛❤🇮🇪❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤💙💚❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

*We'll remember Carpool Karaoke with James Corden* 🎤
They took Craig from is, now they have taken James,what more will they take from us.☹️
God bless you now and forever,  Mr. JAMES CORDEN AND YOUR FAMILY.  YOU WILL NEVER  LEAVE US BECAUSE YOU WILL ALWAYS HAVE A PLACE IN OUR HEARTS . MR. JAMES CORDEN FROM ... from Dr. WHO TO MANY TALENTS SING, LAUGH & DANCE  FOREVER THE BEST MEDICINE FOR THE HUMAN SOUL!
Thank you James for always giving us a good laugh. Wishing nothing but the best for you. <3
It's been a pleasure Mr. James Corden. Goodbye. What an awesome 8 year journey. Take care of your family and wish the best of luck.
having harry as one of your last guests is perfect! this show has honestly been so much fun thanks james and goodluck!
13:21 I’m like 90% sure Jimmy Kimmel is not there and is photoshopped in
Oh, no 😢🥺!!! Thank you for all the shows and lots luck!
I’m gonna miss watching this show 🥺😭
Finally it's over!!! Worst late night show hands down.
After 8 years on the late,late show. I will have time to say goodbye to James Corden 😢😢😢. I wish 🤞it would have been more until a successful host take over. Congratulations and thank you for everything that you taught us for a fantastic 8 year run 🏃‍♂️ on CBS' Late,Late Show. God Bless You, James!
So so much love and respect 😭😭😭😭☹️ Can’t wait to see what else you do James corden 🚀🛫
Thank God this show is finished
CBS took a 28 year television franchise... and flushed it, right down the toilet.  Hopefully you'll hold off on pissing on David Letterman's remaining legacy at CBS until he's died.
Never really watched your show except the carpool karaoke. Brilliant.
One of these days Harry Styles will actually come across as male....not today tho.
Greetings from Germany and thank you for this great show. Will miss not having new fun bits coming my way via YT. Stay awesome and be kind.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💯💯💯💯💯💯🥳😭❤️❤️❤️❤️💯💯💯
Zero talent,America please keep him.
Beautiful final show. ❤ Thanks for so many smiles and songs over the years!
I knew it will be fun and entertaining  After watching it, I have mixed feelings, the end of late late, I can’t, we will miss James, I will everything about the show

Thank you for everything James

You had the opportunity to ask him anything and you ask him about ONE DIRECTION????? Who still cares😭😭
stop it. stop rubbing it in. ill cry. everyday. i can imagine my youtube feed without you james. please come back soon.
Gosh dammit this got me crying
I hope he’s so proud of himself he took a massive risk in doing this show and absolutely smashed it I can’t wait to see what he does when he comes back to the uk like will he come back to league of their own? I love that show ha
I'm really gonna miss James, the band & the whole crew that became a family during covid 😭😭😭👍
Such a cringy guy
You will always be the best late night show host for me ❤️
Thank you James for always entertaining us ❤
Oh god. Please don't come back to England. Stay there James
I love James Corden, white egg omelette or not. Which I personally think is a pile of shite.
You know these comments are being monitored heavily... Not a single bad thing to say about this untalented man child in the comments?

Thank God
What a celebration? Finally a time that we can all get together and celebrate in the fact that James Corden won't be on my YouTube feed all the time. Will not be missed.
17:45 be happy james its harry there 😊
My YouTube feed will never again be the same without new James Corden clips. 😢
I'm surprised when they did the fake laugh sketch that they didn't have the greatest inflictor of the same Jimmy Fallon
Just because the show is over doesn't mean James Corden isn't still a huge D bag.
😭😭😭😭
its about time
Women don’t like black men
We will miss your Creative  entertaining show James Corden,All rhe best
What a show. well done.
you will be missed james ❤
Should of wore a gold suit James go out in style 🤣
Loved the show with its every single part, cannot believe this is it, we are gonna miss you James. All the best
Love the song. Sad to see him go.  Heist the funniest among all late night hosts.
The fact that the last guest was Harry Styles tells a lot❤❤❤❤
We love james❤
Please have a reality show for James parents 😂
Well Goodbye James......you  have Been entertaining for 6/4 years.... Atleast for me.....I hope you get a second chance at entertainment.....Even just As an Actor.....Like your othermovies...  GoodBye and Good Night James.....You have been Amazing......R.I.P The late late Show🙏😔🙏💗🙏😔🙏💗🙏😔

Great show 🎉🎉
As a non-American Harry fan: thank you so much for uploading this 😊
This show has always been my comfort space I will always rewatch these shows thank you so much for everything James!!
I cryed like 5 times. I loved this show so much
I’m very proud of you James, I haven’t been watching the LLS for the whole 8 years, but since I tuned into watching it, it has been a great ride to tag along to. I hope the show really brightens others moods and yours too. I’m so proud of everyone in the LLS team, and I wish the best for you all in the future xx
hysterically crying over the fact it is actually over you will be so missed☹ and all the times harry and the boys came on the show forever iconic
Why is it ending?
First ellen and now James Corden?? When will this good news stop?
Will really miss this show 😢 watched every episode on youtube ❤
Even though I know there's no 1D reunion which break my  heart, I'm still here watching hoping for some kind of 1D reunion
Thank you James
Thanks James for and incredible journey 🙏😊
Thank god this trash is over
James Corden, he's like the TV personality equivalent of Coldplay. In a bad way, don't get any weird ideas.
harold 💚
What a run. Wow. 😊
Wishing you all the best James you made me laugh in my worst days I’ll never forget 😭💞love ya and this show forever will miss everything about this show forever
I hope that you have the best time on your new journey.  Enjoy your 😮family and spend quality time with your family.  Thank you for the laughs and the tears. May God bless you always  Im sad you'are leaving.
the lyrics from the last song should have been at the end "thanks for watching the late late show"... #disappointed
thank you james.
i almost had a heartattack when he mentioned one direction
James and everyone part of the LLS, this is my favorite show. Its what I looked forward to everyday. That's massive. What has been created in the show will always legendary. I remember sometimes being sad that more people did speak about the sheer genius of the show. I have such distinct memories of crying laughing during COVID-19 because of your show and your crew. I came to know your crews names and sometimes even distinct laughs (especially Dave) and loved their interaction. I loved your big stunts, musicals, bits. Nick telling us about his podcast with the lady in the Philippines (which I definitely did watch). I loved this show's humor. The news jingles by Steve. I LOVE THE BAND deeply. Dave's love for Patti Labelle. Rob joining in on the fun. Ben speaking from above. Winnie's distain for James. Hagar's coolness. Reggie's salads. All things Guillermo. Tim's humor!! I really loved the celebrity tour buses with the Avengers, and Prince Harry. Honestly. I could go on. The show was gold.  I am just so thankful. I wish it could last forever, but I have so much respect for James prioritizing his family. I hope every the ABSOLUTE best!! And for the last time. FINS UP BABY!!!
Suprised he didn't slap everyone on the way out
Im sorry, but what is that idiot wearing. Compose yourself young man, become the adult male you were always created to be.
Now bring back conan 😉
James acting fretted and anxious is the one note that he played. He's a human vuvuzeula
best late night show ever
I’m German and even I get all emotional 🥲  I will so miss this show 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🎉👍🏻
Thanks for entertaining us James❤
I'm getting emotional that it has now ended :'(
06:25 sad. Thank you talented James Corden
Wish you the best James in all your future endeavours. We'll miss you❤
Them starting off the video with 'The National Anthem' by Radiohead had me pausing the video multiple times coz you don't expect James Corden to use music by them xD
Thank you James for all the fun. The best show ever on television, when you and Paul McCartney hung out. ❤ Thank you for your creativeness, your brilliance, your kindness and generosity. You will be so very missed. Wishing you and your family, the very best!🤩😍💃🏼🍾
Harry smashed the desk so elegantly
..man.. gonna miss this guy!
James are you kidding me???    Thank you for bringing us such a great show all these years!!💯💯🔥
welcome to the final show❤
Who’s gonna replace him ?
Thank you James Corden for everything you've done, and I can't wait to see what your going to do next ! I wish you all the best and I hope you will have everything you deserve :)  Oh god, I just finished crying my eyes out..gonna miss you
Thank you James Corden❤❤❤for entertaining us❤
The way Harry smashed that desk thoo.. 😭 that seemed personal 😭💚✨      Love the show James! Hate that it’s ending but I’m exited to see what you do in the future! X
Congratulations James ppr all your effort and love that you have put into your program I hope you always have success in everything you do. How amazing that the last show came out Harry. ❤
Love how Will Ferrell just wanted to eat some bug trifle.
I only found out about this show like a month ago and now its over. Thank so much :D Love you always Corden
Thank you for doing global artists such as Blackpink and BTS!🥰
The final episode started writing itself when James was found out to be a horrible person that screams at waiters
stand up everyone . give it up for one of the greatest show host
Thank you for entertaining us for the past 8 years. I’m sad to see the show end but excited to see what the future holds for you
As problematic as James Cordon is, I have to admit that I’m sad to see this show come to an end. Cheers for the last 8 years James
ive been sobbing for 20 minutes
Many thanks for all the memories on the show it’s been a blast. Your the best, will miss you. All the best for your next journey in life 💯💯💯❤️❤️❤️❤️👍
Fun fact: People who hate James are the same person who watched Carpool Karaoke
bye
thank you james ! ♥
I’m still in delusion about the one direction reunion. Is there going to a sequel? An encore? 😢
Ty all
Such authenticity! Credit to CBS for seeing his potential. Hard to replace.
The beard and the grey/silver hair suits Will so well!
This show is so funny and entertaining. Sad it's over and I will miss it. Thank you and congratulations to James and the whole late late team ❤
He does a terrible job of acting like he's a nice person
thank you james and the team, for making my life more fun. For entertaining me, for making me laugh and  for making me feel good. thank you for continuing this show for 8 years.. I will always support you wherever you go next!

😭💔
Thank you James and the entire Late Late Show Team for such fun, humor, laugh out loud moments and very poignant ones too over these past 8 years.  Congratulations on such a wonderful show.  I’ll miss the Late Late Show and I wish each and every one of you all the very best!
20:49 Casually flipping off James/the camera it's hard to tell lol
Me just feeling how sad james would be
gonna miss it. so many amazing memories from this show.
They’re all so excited he’s leaving
The vibe is just not the same.
Fair play to James, hes done a great job over the last 8 years
Thanks to James and the entire crew for 8 great years!!!
The cold open is a lot like The Play That Goes Wrong 😂
I enjoyed Corden's prime time special with Tom Cruise but I fear his last show later tonight missed the mark for me. (First, I don't like Will Ferrell. Ferrell is simply not funny and has been running on fumes for years.) And as much as I love James, he should not have included politics in his farewell speech. I feel that was a bad idea. But I really like James and will miss him and the show a lot! And Reggie is such a musical genius, he will be terribly missed! There's no one else like him! The bit with all the different late-night hosts was great but I feel they should have called it an 'intervention' about him leaving. Good Bye, James, I wish you'd stay!!
Thank you James, Ian, Reggie, Pete, The Band, The Writers, The Producers, The Crew!  Wishing you all the best!
when was he at the White House!?
It was a great final episode but I got to ask...why does Harry sound American?
wish James corden all the best for his future , we ar e really gonna miss him because he always brought a smile to our face whenever we watched him thanks to James and all the crew of the late late show , have a good one
A reunion?!!?? Sshshshshs
Gonna miss you all ❤️
Magic moments, specially with Adele
Finally !!
18:37 Love that Harry's looking out for all their butts. No splinters on Styles' watch! Lol
The reunion will happen one day 😭😭
Wish Corden all the best, it’s been fun.
Out of all the time in human history congratulations on being here tonight to wish James the best will miss you james..
