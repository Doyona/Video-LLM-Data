This week's pinned-comment plug is for my podcast! Lateral is free every week at https://lateralcast.com or wherever you get your audio podcasts, and there are video highlights at https://youtube.com/lateralcast .
Only one third of a ton in weight? The bears at Brooks Falls are 1300 - 1400 pounds.
Do these bears get paid for their time :3
Follow up video: Go Pro is bear resistant
Don't feed the Bazz!
thats not a bear thats a guy in a suit dont lie to me.
"Won't someone please think of the bears".
The biggest problem is there is an overlap between a smart bear and a dumb human.
Good job
The thumbnail made me think it meant the BEAR didn't survive and I was so confused
The military base I was stationed on in Alaska had bears and moose on it. I managed to see both including a momma bear and her 2 cubs dumpster diving near where my unit was having a picnic, and a momma moose and her calf in base housing while I was riding my bicycle. The moose was scarier because they frequently attack humans and can stomp and kick you to death.
The bears probably think they're in a training facility for opening containers and bins
I wanna go hug them I don't care if they eat me.
"There is a considerable overlap between the brainpower of the most intelligent bears, and the least intelligent tourists"
I bet this is a great gig to have for a bear
Such a lovely end ❤
I wonder if just including a layer of gel that tastes absolutely awful but is otherwise harmless would be successful?
They're training super war bears capable of breaking into reinforced locations! Got a proper scifi story in the making!
And this kind of thing is the reason why it is so important to keep national parks funded.
Ey Tom, 1 Year away and we need you and your skills. Whats with the new Car dealership in Washington, how are the Bears doing without State funding and what happens in the world without us aid?
Randy Gravatt, facility manager, at 1:29 seems like a proper wrongun
I read this as “if this bear survives it passes the test” and saw the thumbnail and was extremely concerned/ confused 😭
ALL containers are bear resistant but VERY few are bear proof
I thought the title was referring to the bears surviving lmao.
bear says ty for the bath toy
3:04 "Come on, you piece of trash! Don't you die on me! You've got too much to live for!"
This video just proves that if grizzly bears ever figure out how to drive or use the internet we are so done for
This reminds me of putting dog treats in something my dog will spend a while trying to get into.
When the smartest bear is on par with the dumbest human
Could you just keep stupid people OUT of their area you are putting the bears at risk.  ❤🐻❤❤🐻❤❤
Also means that none of these bears will ever get to be reintroduced?
"it did not survive" 😂😂😂😂😂
Hold up, I was in Yellowstone when this was posted😳
Who else is here after the "man vs. bear" debate?
Bear
Please you’re trapping the bears
I remember when I was doing a little van sight-seeing tour through Yellowstone, the guide told us about a jogger who encountered a grizzly which charged him and ripped one of his butt cheeks off, and he was in the middle of nowhere so he had to go find himself some help, walking through the woods, de-butt cheeked.
GoPro not bear tested.
Now let them review smart phones.
If the bears produce a Gutenberg we're all in serious trouble. Thankfully they're still working with a crude oral tradition. Without the benefit of universal free public education.
"we're training bears to break into contrainers" time to let them loose into the suburbs.
"Bears aren't going to eat a camera, they're smart enough not to." Bear: Eats camera
"Why did you kill that bear?" "He knew too much, the risk that he would teach his forbidden knowledge to other bears was too high".
"There is an overlap between the most intelligent bears and the dumbest humans." People laugh at this comment. I shook my head and sighed because it's 100% true...
In a year, all I would remember of that video are "Bear giving CPR" and "Bear with a GoPro"
Those containers have to withstand unBEARable abuse.
"We ask them not to call out to the bears." Why!?! Do you mean to say that you put them on display and then intend to re-wild them? I have doubts. EDIT: "Bear with a go pro, definitely not recording anymore"...Did you make that up on the spot? Maybe it is a good thing that you stop making videos.
Remember be careful of wild animals and don't feed them also be careful with electric devices as they could be dangerous to you or someone else and or start a fire Also there's a tick called a lone star tick that to my knowledge can make you allergic to red meat (which I think is mammal meats) and other mammal products along with transmitting other dangerous diseases so from what I read you should get immediate medical attention if bitten Finally be careful with molds and mushrooms
I was there a couple years ago it was so cool
Hey Tom, I ran into you in New York at some bar a few years ago, probably 2019? Definitely pre covid.  I walked up to you and said, you're that youtube guy, right? I think the chances of that meeting were astronomical, and the chances of you reading this comment are even less so. I hope you're doing alright, and it was very formative for me.
"so Randy, what do you do for a living?" "I spread peanut butter on the inside of trash cans."  I'm sure he says something more like: "I work with grizzly bears to test bear-safe containers", or "I work at a wildlife habitat/Yellowstone" but I know I would say the peanut butter one.
Now do the Super Bear test by giving the bear a chainsaw
"We cannot blame Yogi for his actions. He is but a symptom of a much larger problem in society. FREE YOGI!!!" -BooBoo
no one will ever convince me that an animal with ears like that is an apex predator
i would rather not be around bears
he makes it sound like the bears are only in the park, they are not only in the park, they're all around!
Years ago I bought a very sturdy container to protect a sensitive and expensive set of weighing scales for the lab. The container claimed to be indestructible, with a lifelong guarantee.  However, the warranty gave three exceptions to that: bear attacks, shark bites and children under 5...
Tom: Picnic Subtitles: "Pick-a-nick"
test the plastic wrap hammock
cascades will NOT survive a bear
1:02 Going and showing off that garbage can, it just occurred to me: is that design of public trashcan not ubiquitous to many parts of the world? Obviously I don't expect China or Egypt to necessarily use the same designs for things, but just looking at the US, is that design not present all across the US? Having spent most of my life in a bear heavy area, it just never occurred to me.
Even bears are critics......
I love how the bear drools when it smells the food just like a dog would
Yet people give Australia sh!t for *our* animals. Well I can say I'm very glad I don't have to deal with bears.
this is how zoos should be. instead of small enclosures where u can always see them, have large areas where they can walk off if they want too
Engineers designing containers need to consider the overlap of the smartest bears and the dumbest people...
very nice love to see bears get a second chance!
Fun Fact: Bears are actually just big and fluffy dogs.
Are they testing tents to find which ones are bear proof? Seems like a real hassle camping in the US. Here in Australia we just have to keep out the mozzies, march flies, centipedes, scorpions, snakes, spiders, boars and crocodiles.
I appreciate that he tells the bear off
is that gopro passes the bear resistant ? edit: just saw the next video and it is 🤣
Am I bear resistant?
Bear: Hey! There's food here! Look everyo- Human: You know too much. (euthanizes)
Gone-Pro.
Oh my god, someone get an Anne doll (the ones they use for CPR) in the enclosure and see if a bear performs chest compressions on it. Would be an instant viral hit.
That's...  not ideal. xD
I stayed in that hotel behind Tom in the beginning of the video! Yellowstone is such an amazing place.
And by "overlap" the ranger must have meant that all of the bears are smarter than all of the tourists.
"The bear's favourite method, at least with the trash cans, is the CPR method."  Bear pushing up and down on the trash can: "DIE! DIE! DIE! . . ."
"can I put a go pro in the bin?" "sure, but I hope you're not wanting it back"
Was coming here to make sure the intelligence quote was present
Meanwhile in Canada a couple and their dog were killed by a grizzly recently
One GoPro was hurt in the making of this film.
The world needs more Tom Scotts to tell these stories ❤
Just heard recent “Stuff You Should Know” podcast “Night of the Grizzlies”. I can recommend it, as it gives good background for this video.
2:08 Yummie...
Those bear resistant coolers must be very heavy.I pity the poor fool who carries them.
I’ll always remember a saying about why there’s no bear-proof trash cans from a park ranger in Yellowstone. “We can’t make a bear-proof trash can because there’s a sizeable crossover between the smartest bears and the dumbest people.”
I didnt know mark hamil worked with bears part time
RIP gopro
Love the description " The bear performs CPR on the trash can to kill it " 🐻🐻🐻
the end gives major “Stop It bear, bear stop eating my kayak bear” energy
I LOVE the Grizzly & Wolf Discovery Center!  We got to see some rescued raptors there up close & personal, it was a great experience.  We also got to see Sam the bear get some quality outdoor time.  Absolutely lovely place to visit after walking/driving all over Yellowstone the previous day.
The main problem I can see with these bear resistant bins is accessibility. How do you make a bin that's hard for bears to open, but easy for someone with limited hand mobility?  So I don't think it's necessarily a case of a lack of intelligence in humans - there may be other reasons why they're unable to open the bin.
The GoPro I had in 2016 directly backed up any footage it recorded to my phone.   Homie sounded sad when he discovered the camera he threw into a bear enclosure was lost lmao 😂
seeing the bear performing cpr on the bin: if not friend, why friend-shaped?
Bear employees. X'D
"That's not ideal" -- love the British ability to downplay all things.
its interesting just how many corvids are with the bears
Tom: that's not ideal Little did he know that that was the most ideal scenario that could have happened
If not friend, why friend shaped?
That last bear is trying to become a vlogger :p
Still smarter than most Americans
bears don't pass on their knowledge to cubs
1:18 Hey BooBoo! Let’s see what’s in our picanic basket!
I live in Canada, admittedly in the more settled part of Southern Ontario. It never ceases to amaze me how many people don't realize wild animals are just that, 'wild'; even here in Canada. To them your as much a treat as any rabbit or deer they might get their paws on.
Yesss
That park ranger quote about the intelligence overlap between the smartest bears and the dumbest humans was golden
Tom Scott has missed the chance to say "Well I guess that bear is officially a blogger now."
To be fair, my pit bull has destroyed things that have passed my bear tests, but I just think that's because he's a bit more clever and has been conditioned to be a lot more driven.  Sometimes there's not a cliff to chuck things off.
The GoPro bit at the end is hilarious!!  No don’t take it in the water! 😂
“There’s an overlap with the most intelligent bears and the least intelligent people.” 😂
I wonder if Teddy is humming “Staying Alive” while performing CPR on the trash bin. 😂😂😂
Yogi is testing pic-a-nic baskets. 😂😊👍
Also don’t pet the fluffy cows, swim in the hot springs, and obey the rangers
I always thought it was funny how the main problem is the intelligence overlap between the smartest bears and the dumbest tourists
poor gopro
So the GoPro was bear resistant 👍🏼

"A bear given enough time will get into most-anything" is the new infinite monkeys on infinite typewriters.
Ravens sitting back watching.  "Have they figured it out yet? Oh, Bob has! Come on, dinner is ready!"
"that's not ideal" Translated American "omfg the bear drowned my cam" 😄
how does killing all aggressive bears 'keep the wilderness wild' lmao
for a second i thought you meant if the bear survives one hour 💀
Bears are Nature's Bros
I fear no man, but that thumbnail, it scares me
Huh. It seems that Juuso, a brown bear in Lapland, Finland, has a habit of testing whether it can break anything that gets placed in its enclosure. I know he has made a few paintings in the past too. I wonder if he'd like another part-time job as a half a ton crushing machine? "Bear tested, Juuso approved."
I feel like this video is very American. Or do other have countries bear problems as well?
it seems that Yogi Is not happy about being recorded.
I hope I will meet you in a very random place one day
bears may give up if a container is too difficult, but a sandworm will just be driven into a killing frenzy
A moment of silence for Tom's Go-Pro.
I have always gone to yellowstone nearly every few years and I love it I was so happy when I saw this video
Really wish more people were aware of the future dangers we'll face if they accept curious bears with open arms
I was there last year, a very classy operation that respects the animals. I wish more places would focus on quality over quantity.
I just realised these bears are living the heist movie/cyber thriller plot where they were caught breaking into something they shouldn't, and in order to avoid punishment have to make a deal with the government to work as pen testers to help keep the public safe from their kind. All that's missing is a third act twist where they double cross the feds and break into the strategic salmon reserve themselves.
1:15 rip yogi
"His face is so weird"
cpr method fckin killed me
Guess that lady didn’t watch this video
Tom's new job. Bear Proofing Go Pro's
What I've learned is that bears are just big raccoons
Hey, I passed out and smacked my face on the tarmac at that centre!
Hey, I passed out and smacked my face on the tarmac at that centre!
Or was it? see part two come later this fall?
Pic-a-nic basket. Hahahaha ah memories.
"There's a considerable overlap between the brainpower of the most intelligent bears and least intelligent tourists"😆
are we sure the crows present there wont learn to guide bears to campsites and bins so that they could scavenge off of the stuff the bear left behind?
It's gotta be a mindfuck for those bears...like, their whole lives they've never managed to successfully get food from messing with human stuff, then they get in once and all of a sudden they're taken to a special place where everything they've ever known is reversed. All of their conspiracy theories are confirmed 🤣
Now i know that if i need CPR and a bear is around, ill be good
I've never heard a truer quote than the bear/human overlap of intelligence.
Dr Mike would be very proud with those CHEST COMPRESSIONS!
And remember! Don't molest the bears
i was literally just there
23 videos left
Another great and educational video! Great to see the amazing work going on to protect both tourists and bears. P.S. I loved the cheeky "pick-a-nick" Yogi Bear nod in the subtitles @1:16.
23 remain..
The intelligence overlap quote followed by the bear taking the Go-Pro into the water at the end make this pure gold.
At least one person(me) appreciates the non-clickbait thumbnail which still draws attention and is interesting.  Sincerily, thank you for stepping out of line and having a pair.  I soley subscribe to/view said courageous channels. All others go directly into the nearest trash recepticle without hesitation.
If they train their cubs to do CPR, we are just a few generations away from _bear paramedics!_ 🎉
We got some footage from that action cam but the ride with the bear was unattainable? 😞
Tom’s in west Yellowstone which means he flew into Bozeman which means I was within a couple miles of Tom. Damn you Tom.
The Bear grabbing the GoPro specifically and bringing it to the water makes it seem like the Bear knew exactly what this strange thing was for and decided to mess with Tom on a personal level.
Does GoPro warranty cover "eaten by bear"?
Now that the bears have a GoPro I’m looking forward to seeing four bears sitting around one bear’s kitchen, telling jokes about Wikipedia articles.
So you're saying that if I dress like a trash can and then have a heart attack, there's a non-zero chance I may get reanimated by a bear doing the CPR method?
Bear-illiant, as always.
Allowing your child to climb and hang on the fence is very irresponsible and stupid! A bear charges at phenomenal speeds and can grab the child before you react. What's wrong with you lot?
Did you get your GoPro back? Was it 'bear proof'?
You risk a go-pro, you might lose a go-pro.
Fun fact! The trash cans in the Adirondak Park in upsate NY, USA are different from those featured in this video because the bears in the Adirondacks figured out how to open these trash cans.
God damn it Tom one of these days you and I will meet since you keep visiting places 5 days before I’m there too
I like how the quick search is “rick roll video”
If peanut butter/maple/kibble is in those containers i know I wouldn't pass the test...
So, a dumb question; if they have to keep providing the occasional win to the bears so they keep opening containers, could they theoretically just not do that and rehabilitate them for wildness?
Rip gopro
3:22 You got a little self righteous when talking about your concern for the bears. Did you think Americans were there to abuse the bears. They are letting them come to this area instead of euthanizing them.  Check your ego bro.
I know a guy who is bear-resistant. No matter how many he took on, he'd still be walking the next day. Said he could take on 10 bears.
RIP Go-Pro. 📷😢
Here in the Netherlands we have underground containers. A sliding meganism makes sure no one can access the trash that has been put in. Why invent something if its already invented?
Would have liked to see some backpacking bear canisters, but I suppose new products in this market are few and far between.
These people: “we can’t feed the bears or else they will become too close to society”  Also these people: puts bears in park zoo and feeds them The bears: “damn it I wish I was the bear in the park”
Me; Going for a walk in the wood, oh no heart attack.  Bear: DW mate, I got you.
what a perfect ending :)
Uh oh, looks like a bad day for the, Cott Family
Finally! A place I've been to BEFORE Tom Scott made a video about it!
People-proof bear feaders.
“Let the bears pay the bear tax, I pay the Homer tax”
Doctor mike would be proud these chest compessions are great
It would have been strange, if he wouldn't have gone for the GoPro.    :)
Wait if the GoPro was trashed how'd we get the footage at e.g. 3:12? Memory card survived and recovered later?
Pick-a-nick baskets 😂
Yup, bears are smarter than the average human tourists, that's for sure 😂
"Bears are very intelligent and would never take a GoPro it doesn't interest them" Bear instantly takes the GoPro and drowns it
All fun and games until the bears learn how to pickpocket, break free, and teach their bearethren how to bear tools and beareak through containers. I can bearely fathom the horror
Mark Hamill works with bears?
It's going for 3 days letssssssss goooooooooo
how do you lock out and tag out bears to comply with OSHA?
I didn´t expect bears to be that dumb. Any dog, cat, bird would have figured out an unlocked lid.
"It's gone ! That's... not ideal" xD
I’m glad you mentioned the quote. It’s one of my favorite quotes of all time. :)
rip gopro
Thank god for these trainers for teaching bears CPR, so if... no... WHEN the day comes that day and they see a human whose heart has stopped, they will be able to render aid.
"Thats a bear with a gopro" fills me with an odd amount of joy- I wonder, what would a bear do with a gopro if given the knowledge of what one is-
I very much enjoyed the pic-a-nic basket reference.
Thank you for your sacrifice, little gopro 😢🙏
3:15 imagine being unconscious and waking up to a *Bear giving you CPR 🐻*
coolest way to lose a GoPro tbf!
That go pro footage has to be great
lock them all up.
Bears get so smart they have to work a day job. America-core
CPR method 😂😂😂 not for me thanks, I prefer the reanimation palets 😅
"That's not ideal" is the best understatement ever when it comes to bears. My brother used to live somewhere where they'd be snuffling around his bins but they were never quite motivated enough to tear them to bits, mainly because he used a separate thing for food waste. They're still incredible to see up close!
Tom the kiddy diddler
I live in Western Canada in Grizzly Bear country.  What we say here is "A fed bear is a dead bear", so please don't feed the bears.  They are just fine without you
How did you get the gopro footage back?
Sir Thomas Scott: I am amazed. I know you are about to take sabbatical but the quality of your videos remains above and beyond!
That parking lot he starts filming in, I got lost there once. My 8th grade class took a trip all over Montana right before graduation, and that place was one of the stops. There was a filming building nearby the group left to go to, but I was left behind. Took me a while to find the group again.
BEAR PRISON
Only the bears that have unlocked the forbidden knowledge get this job
I vote you take over for BBC after the old guy dies
Did you get your gopro back eventually?
I cannot help but think this "product testing" also works as a form of enrichment.
When I lived in the city, I had two squirrels absolutely ravage my heavy-duty plastic outdoor trash cans. Can only imagine the damage a bear can do! Stand between an animal and food at your own risk, I guess.
well its probably about time to replace your Go Pro with a 'Gone Pro' anyway
Wow my family and I were just here a couple days ago
why not feed the dumber tourists to the bears? problem solved!
The Go-Pro was not bear resistant.
The bears are literally QA Testers, i love it
Oh wow, I just got into West yellowstone 4 days ago haha
You want to put a camera in the bear enclosure? Your loss.
I worked for a company making a bear resistant cooler in 2018 or so. It passed. I didn't get to go but I did get to play with the post-bear cooler.
23 Videos to go!
Another video demonstrating how unreliable GoPros are -- and, really, if they can't stand up to a couple grizzlies, what good are they?😄
"That's... not ideal." 😂
So the TL:DR is that the venn diagram slice between "humans can use" and "bears can't use" is extremely slim ok I gotcha
I will seriously miss Tom Scott's uploads when he goes on vacation 😭😭
4:42 😅
The CPR method 😂
I think the bear realizes what the GoPro does and took it to film the bear having fun in the pond.  Don’t introduce YouTube or TikTok to them…
I was there a few years ago. Truly an amazing place. Including the center
How did you get footage at 2:49 if gopro was destroyed?
One thing i saw about how hard it is to make a bear resistant trash cans is that there is a big overlap between the smartest bears and the dumbest tourists.
With 6 million subscribers he can probably afford to sacrifice a gopro!
Americans: Teeheehee! The wild animals in Australia are so scary! They're all going to kill you!  Also Americans:
This❤
Judging by the short go pro footage and the little clip at the end, go pros aren't bear resistant^^
4:43 One of the Hardest quotes of all time
Pff... bear-proof is easy mode.  It takes armor plating to make something raccoon proof.
That is a fantastically clever way to avoid euthenising bears and turning  their  learned bad habit into a positive for everyone
"You, uh, want me to get a bear to help you open that?" -Drake Parker
bear resistant trash can or cooler should be made out of steel with reinforced locks and hinges to withstand the punishment a bear can do to it, not some plastic which will break quite easily if a bear puts all of its weight on it.
Yellowstone National Park is renowned for its strong commitment to humane animal treatment. The National Park Service (NPS) is more about conservation than tourism. And it's a public service, not for profit. The NPS' main job is to protect the parks and wildlife from humans.
I'd love to see Tom in the bear suit
Love it, crush test bears. Smarter than the average bear boo boo!
So go pro is bear-resistant, at least the memory part.
😹😹😹😹😹poor GoPro it had a good life once, but alas it’s now pushing up them there daisies after the loving help of a Yogi bear who thought it needed a good bath after it’s peanut butter and syrup bath😹😹😹😹😹
I think it's great that (at least some bears) that have gone down the route of trying to steal food from humans are being used for this. They at least to live and they get fed.
This video was an absolute delight to watch. I hope the sanctuary might think around to streaming some more bear vs container testing; it’s a good watch!
Bears love a good pic-a-nic basket!
The GoPro wasn't Bear-Resistant xD
I love that the bear found something new and immediately started playing with it (once the food was gone).  Shows just how inquisitive they are.
"There is considerable overlap between the intelligence of the smartest bears and the dumbest tourists."
Did you get your gopro?
The bear wandering off with Tom's GoPro illustrates that bears are also curious. That's the only explanation for why a bear would pay attention to something that doesn't smell like food. It didn't try to smash it like a big coconut or something like that.
If that go pro survived, the shots would have been amazing!
Like for the next bear pool vlog next weekend.
Most people dont know how to work bear proof garbage cans
RSVP that gopro. It contributed much to science, but it really had no chance once that bear decided it found a new toy.
The 'CPR Method' made me laugh so bad.
bear jail. All inmates: grand theft picnic
If these bears escape no container will ever be safe again
Well it's good to know that if I fall out in the forest that a bear can perform CPR on me and bring me back.
I went here a few summers back before actually going into the park and I highly recommend seeing this place before going into Yellowstone. It gives you a great sense of what would happen and what would be trying to get into your stuff and the employees are very great at educating you on best practice. Just in general support this amazing non-profit
Someone left Cheeto dust on the go pro
Lisa, I wanna buy your rock.
Bears can smell the future.
Wait, so you got footage from the gopro but didn't put the footage in that had the bear carrying it in its mouth?
Instead of euthanasia why not send the bears there
5:35 And it's gone. ... Not ideal... 🤣🤣🤣 In french we say "J'suis pas pour ! J'suis pas pour !" 🤣🤣🤣
where’s the on sight edit
Currently studying for my bear test, anyone got some tips?
I read the title as “if the bear survives for an hour, it passes the test”
The problem is when smarter than your average bear is also smarter than a below average human...
Thanks for taking the time to show us a good place that respects the bears and in fact helps solve the issues instead of exacerbating them, that's the type of thing that makes you so special, Tom!
Tom: "The bear isn't going to care about this camera." Bear: "I definitely care about this camera."
YOU DIDNT GET THE WATER PROOF GOPRO?!!?😂
man i wish I could pet a bear
ffs those bears should unionize. They're doing so much work and getting paid in food only. Talk about modern slavery.
That bear knew to destroy the evidence on that go pro! They are certainly smart 😂
"Bears are smart, they're not going to be interested in a GoPro" >Cut to bear dipping it into the water.
NOTE TO SELF...GoPro is not bear resistant!   😊
The GoPro 😂
People are honestly using plastic for things that are supposed to resist bears...?!  Everyone knows all  you need is 5 to 10 millimeters of good, honest American made rolled homogeneous armor steel, perfect for everything from trash pandas to bears to thieving humans and even armored fighting vehicles
Is that the actual place that they kind of recreated in the game horizon zero dawn? (the frozen wilds dlc)
Where is the GoPro footage :-)
Welcome to Montana Tom!
I love bears
That's not ideal;)
I love the fact that they say there's a large overlap in intelligence between the tourists and bears 😂😂 so true
btw for the future, you can sream a gopro's video to another device just in case it gets destroyed, you have something to work with.
edit: here at the grizzly and wolf parking lot.
Since when does Luke Skywalker run a bear park
0:45 "And if the bears pass murderous aggression towards human beings onto their cubs, then suddenly...the wilderness isn't so wild anymore...." I don't think this guy knows what the word "wild" means?
I'm very happy that you included the supposed quote by a supposed park ranger. It's one of my all time favorite jokes whether it's true or not, and if you hadn't included it, I would have commented it anyways. Also a very enjoyable video 😊
Oh great, now you're enabling bears to set up their own YouTube channels.
I'm sure those are the happiest bears on earth. They get fun puzzles to break and smash and yummy treats if they win then they sleep good too I bet. That makes me happy
a bear with a taste for electronics 😄
Animal welfare king being concerned and looking deeper at the spectacle of the research center we love
Thank you for spotlighting this establishment.  Planning a trip to that area soon and just added this to the itinerary.
GoPro qualified as resistant to bear and tear, but not water.
Video idea:   As a Doctor of Pharmacy student, I’d love to see a video on the difference between pharmaceutical drug prices in the UK and US, particularly regarding the contrasting market structures and the role of the governments within.
They don't just test trash cans the also test gopros and now we know that gopros aren't even bear resistant
How'd this British guy end up all over America? Just asking questions
Tom asking if there's bears in the sanctuary whilst looking left and right is the funniest thing
I'm really going to miss Tom Scott's videos.
the bear habitat gets only 1 acre? oh no... they need at least 25, you cheap greedy Yellowstone national park people...
Did you get your GoPro back?
Hope you stayed to listen to the wolves howl!
This was a great video, thank you Tom!
Note To Self: "Do Not Hide In The Trash Bin"
oversized doggy fren gives cpr
The bear got the Go Pro. I hope he doesn't make TikTok videos now :D
cant the cans just blare sirens and flash lights if bear activity is suspected like a tip  or a button that needs to be pressed, you would probably see very few bears flashbanged return to trash cans soon
Ha-ha !  all you are doing is teaching the bears to wait quietly until you open the box for them !They already know what to do with cameras !!
They were told not to make peanut butter flavored GoPros.... They didn't listen..... They didn't listen
RIp GoPro )::
as someone from the UK the idea of wild bears seems like something out of fiction or ancient history. seeing a wild one in real life must be crazy
That bear will go on to have a successful vlogging career
23 more to go
That is a bear with a go pro! No not in the water 🤣🤣🤣🤣 so much for that footage
DID THE GOPRO SURVIVE?!
So can I work here please?
So too curious bears become lab scientists? Neat.
Can’t wait for Bear Vlogs
3:15 stayin' alive, stayin' alive
i miss you already
Im sure though that the bears realize something has happened to them, and ever since then, they've been in this place all the time that is the same every day, there is no variety in their surroundings and that they are even able to understand that something has happened to them, something bad that they survived and thats why they are here. They must know they are in some kind of rehab situation
A special shoutout to the videographer! Excellent footage! I wonder what camera / lens is used for the interview with Randy Gravatt at 1:28 such clean bokeh and perfect focus 😍🥹
Bear was using Tom's GoPro to taking bathing footage for the bear's FansOnly page!
There's most definitely a major overlap between the bears and humans.
Don't put peanut butter in a GoPro case, got it.
I have found my spirit animal. I use the same technique to open a pickle jar.
so now i know, if i ever need someone to do CPR on me, I should get a bear to do it.
Do a video on how you use bots to cheat your viewer and subscriber count..
And that's how you loose a go pro to a bear's mouth
2:38 I think you'll find thats 'ON' the bin and not 'IN' the bin 😂😂😂😂
Apparently gopro isn't bear resistant
I will miss the weekly uploads, but glad you're looking after yourself, Fact Man.
The bear was just trying to save the containers life, why are you all just standing there!? Call 911!
I was recently in Banff, Alberta and they had bear-proof bins. I couldn't figure it out immediately, so I asked someone sweeping the streets. We had a good chat about it.
rip gopro
aren’t these bears being taught to break into bins and coolers and things though? that’s not great surely
It's good to know that if you're in trouble in the wild, a helpful bear can give you CPR.
I live in an area with a lot of bears and tourists and that old adage is very true! Thanks for talking about the bears Tom!
The colour saturation of this video makes me unreasonably angry
The bear giving CPR to the bin: "Don't you die on me!!"
I would pay to see a bear test opening a carbon fibre submirsible.
How did you get the gopro back to get the footage off it?
GoPros can do a lot, but they're not bear-resistant in the standard protective case. TIL.
I was so excited to see footage from the GoPro...
RIP GoPro
What a coincidence that I was just in West Yellowstone yesterday!!
Most people thought that by 2023 there will be flying cars, but we'll have to settle for bears with GoPros, which is the next best thing.
See, Tom, with all your knowledge about the world you did learn something really new today: don't give GoPros to bears.  Even the experts overestimated the bear's interest in modern motion capture equipment.  They also like iPhones.
Tell me why I want to hug each and every one of those damm adorable murder dogs 😍
I hope that camera's last moments were recovered!
"Look at me. I am the cameraman now."  -Bear, after the GoPro became its new bath toy
Make sure you don't try to pet the "fluffy cows" while you are in the park!
Safe to say the GoPro was not, in fact, bear-resistant
I think it passed "bear" minimum
I remember outside of an Alberta private campsite, there was an old car with the roof caved in and the trunk in shreds of metal... a tourist warning not to leave food in your car.
The cool thing about this place is that by the nature of the way they do their testing, they're extremely good at certifying whether products are bear resistant. They only house bears who developed a knack for getting into human food, and all they do for the rest of their lives is break into containers that they shouldn't be able to get into. If a container can withstand the attempts of these bears, there's likely no bear on earth that could get into it.
This guy has battle scars on his face.
Okay these are like, specialists at this very task though. This is like seeing if a mission is viable for the average person via sending in the A-Team.
It looked so adorable and relateable in those last few seconds where it was investigating the shiny :D
🧺 💯
"Thats.... not ideal" 🤩
So he finally got into the container using just his bear hands!
What a great use of humanized bears as opposed to euthanizing!!  Now that’s using your noggin’ for animal welfare and much needed human education! 🧐👍🏻
Yogi didn't get aggressive, in fact it was the officer who lost his temper every week!! So I think you've been lead astray. Thanks for trying.
I’m supposed you didn’t have the GoPro recording to a phone
Am I the only one who got to see twix’s bear commercial while watching this video?
So can't they just make everything from metal so they can't get in.
There's no such thing as free meals, not even for bears. They have to work afterwards😉
Blimey.
Naughty bears get put in the food paradise containment unit
happy that some of these bears get a second change in a calm environment
I think I was in one of the shots you made
Dont use "kilometers" in freedom country. Also the person who shoved the napkin in the latch because they couldnt figure it out is hilarious
What if trying to get no one to feed bears, we just get everyone to feed the bears? If they always full, what's the problem?
Bear reviews!
5/10 could use more bears
Around here (northern New Hampshire), the bear opens the trash can, and an hour later, the skunk follows after to check out his leftovers
Got to love the Britishness of seeing a bear chew your GoPro then drop it in a pond thoroughly wrecking it, and having the response "that's not ideal"
i guess the go-pro did not pass the bear test
So there are a group of people that need to "take care" of bears that know too much?
Too bad, I really would have liked more gopro bear footage 😅
I'm curious, did Tom claim on his insurance for that GoPro or did he just count it as a loss
As well as the overlap between clever bears and stupid people, there are probably accessibility concerns to consider as well. People without full use of their hands, or only one hand, might struggle with using things that are designed not to work with bear paws. There is probably a balance somewhere between high human accessibility and high bear exclusion.
Faith in God  restored
imagine getting killed and reanimated at the same time by a bear. great CPR on the trash bin
Bwahahaha... Vloggy Bear!
Seemslike you need to make a bear-proof gopro case then. Luckily, you now know where to test.
Bears are strong. And persistent.
Of course that bear took the gopro!
This video was fantastic 😂
If there's anything Big Clive has taught it's that bears can figure out how to get into anything, especially electronic devices sold at Poundland.
i woulda really liked to see the footage from the camera that the bear stole XD
Part of this video was filmed by a bear but sadly the footage was lost
I want a Pixar movie about bears in this park
Finally somewhere where I’ve been and Scott has
That bear takes his job very seriously. Once he was done testing the trash bin he went straight into testing the GoPro
Sign: Dont talk with bears Tom: Dont, do not put the gopro in the water, bear. Thats...
Now I want a show called ”The most intelligent bear vs the least intelligent tourist”
Congrats on getting on trending, Tom!
Bears with jobs!
I'm not sure why parks don't use bins which are easy to put rubbish into, but difficult to get rubbish out of.
It turns out that nowadays Yogi bear would be euthanized 😮
DA BEARS
Rip gopro
I really have to appreciate that the transcriber for the subtitles here spelled "picnic" as the very Yellowstone/Yogi-bear appropriate "pick-a-nick". Top-tier subtitles ❤
RIP GoPro. Wish we had gotten more bear cam POV but awesome video!
Interesting to see that bears have figured out cyclical fatigue in plastic
Strange. I was in West Yellowstone and the park yesterday
Strange. I was in West Yellowstone and the park yesterday
"that's a bear with a gopro" has to be the best thing I heard this year so far.
If not friends, why friend shaped hmm?? If not allowed to pet them, why are they so soft? Hmm??
Feel oddly proud knowing Tom Scott came to check out my home state 😊
"These are rescued bears"
my favorite line of this video is: "there's a considerable overlap between the brainpower of the most intelligent bears, and the least intelligent tourists" at 4:42
Tom: why would a bear be interested in a gopro? bear: hey cool a gopro! I'm gonna take it for a swim.
imagine passing out and waking up to a bear performing CPR to you
its crazy to me how freakin long bear claws are. those paws arent small, and their claws stick out like knives. even a light swipe would probably seriously mess me up
Tom's got my dream job. Travel the world, learn interesting things, and only needs to upload 5 minute videos a week!
Good bye gopro !
Theres a bear backpack called like "the wise backpack" that i found in multiple official lists from parks for approved bear cans. But. It doesn't exist. I eventually found the patent for it. But it never made it into manufacturing. I think I found inventor was incarsorated. But it was tested and certifies by bear testing. So... thats the fun little thing I can add to this.
love it tom!
4:40 ❤
It's a bear rehab for human food addicts
Can we tackle the fact thay we're only an ill-closed latch away of releasing the planet's most skilled burglar bears onto the population with literal years of constant training in their bear hands?
Love it
Deadly? Yes. Fluffy and Cuddly? VERY YES!
Smarter than the average bear, Boo Boo. 😊
“That’s… not ideal.” 😂😂😂
okay, go pro, not bear resistant, next...
Props for the Yogi reference 😎👍
Wouldn't it be easier to actually euthanize the people that feed the bears? That way no-one would dare to do that in the future.
Great video Tom, going to miss you.
Thank you for your sacrifice, GoPro.
Aw, the bears just need a hug.
Stay away from the buffalo Nice yogi bear reference
I like how they only let the bear try a finished product, built as a tank, for an hour to test if its bear resistant. And yet some 6% of the US population think they can take on a bear in hand to hand combat. So, I say give those americans an hour to take on a bear in hand to hand and we can certify them as bear besting capable.
RIP Tom's GoPro x)
I guess that will be the best GoPro care claim of that day. A bear tried to open a bear resistant container, gave up as that was too much work, then tried to become a vlogger/influencer and started out with some candid underwater shots. Sadly the GoPros bear resistance did not overlapse the lack of the bears technical aptitude.
weird question: can we train bears to perform CPR on humans?
I love how happy that bear looks in that second shot of the cpr method. Such a slobbery good boy.
Sooo bears with prep time can break into anything. Got it.
I take it you didn't get the gopro footage back?
Bullet proof and bear proof are the same thing. Nonsense. If the Caliber or bear is big enough or there are enough of em. Sooner or later something will give.
Kind of wanted to see the footage of bear trying to open the more resistant ones
Imagine the horror of hearing that Yogi Bear had been euthanised.
Now in the next video we see, how tom is rescuing his GoPro from the bear. xD
The problem with making bear proof trash cans is that the overlap between the smartest bears and the dumbest humans is too large.
The bear was like "I didn't give you precision to film me now suffer the consequences"
your videos are one of the best on youtube by far tom.
new buisness idea: bear safe go pros!
Was waiting for the in-can footage until there was a bear with a go-pro 😂
That bear was like "some idiot threw out a perfectly good GoPro... mine now sucker"
The dumb people are the ones when you explain something to them they have no idea what you're talking about.
I have been trying to keep bear out of garage tote for a couple months. Tried 5 different ways to keep lid closed. Every time I think there is no way bear is getting in this time.  My focus now is keeping can upright, has worked for couple months.
4:44   You forgot to turn off backface culling
I know this video is purely educational but I cannot stop myself from giggling when the bear does the CPR method and touches its toes like a giant dog baby.
smart, clever bear... 🐻
You need a gorilla, not a bear. Everyone knows the real luggage test is an angry  captive gorilla.
Rest well little GoPro 😥
Guess it's a GonePro now, huh?
Fun to see a CPR, I was actually expecting the bear slash the box with his claw.
At 1:17 you can hear Tom trying not to say pic-i-nik basket like Yogi Bear
CHEST COMPRESSIONS   CHEST COMPRESSIONS  CHEST COMPRESSIONS
Oh to read Tom's insurance claim; how was the camera lost? Stolen by a bear and dropped in a lake. Ah Tom Scott, oh course it was.
o7 GoPro
"that is a bear with a go-pro" are going to be my final words.
All you need is a ks-23 or a ash-12 to protect your food. Jokes aside the amount of people who dont know to keep food away from where you personally will be sleeping is kinda crazy so i can only imagine people are super careless leaving food around
I like how they didn't mind the camera being attached to the bin, because it wouldn't be problem for them, nor the bear, only for Tom himself. :)
Cociane bear sent me here
Loved this one! Short, sweet and filled with bears!
When you see the bear press his weight onto the can, you can really tell... ...that's a lotta weight.
rip gopro
After an hour, the video is officially Bear-Resistant! Congratulations on keeping the bears at bay!🎉
"Hey Jamie, pull up that video where the bear is doing CPR"
I'd like to know how exactly they caught those bears, I'm thinking a Jurassic Park tier operation
Shouldn't laugh, but when the bear had Tom's GoPro and the resulting commentary really made me chuckle. 😅
What what? There are no bears in Australia except for the fabled drop bears of course.
My trash bin isn’t even cat-resistant, much less dog-resistant, raccoon-resistant, or coyote-resistant. Each of those animals has successfully gotten into my trash bins over the years, mainly because the bins are top-heavy when full. If an animal pushes on it or jumps onto the lid but lands on the edge, the bin falls over. No way it’d last more than a second with a bear.
From the thumbnail, I presumed you meant the trash bin, but apparently you meant your camera. RIP
The bear saying "finally they gave us a go pro! All those times only snacks in those silly containers while I was searching for kits to start ny YouTube passion!"
"There is a considerable overlap between the intelligence of the smartest bears and the dumbest tourists." -Yosemite Park Ranger on why it's hard to design a bear-proof garbage can.
Is that a Yogi bear reference at 1:17 ?
👍🏼
-1 gopro
But how is it euthanasia? It's not bad for the bears at all to be stealing food harming humans, only for us. So let's just say kill.
must say... watching that GoPro get destroyed was unbearable.
The facility manager reminds me of Ron Swanson xD
I don't understand that intelligence remark.
Did your GoPro survive or was it a total loss afterwards?
Okay, I get the so-called "Parks authority" says bears are "wild" and "dangerous", however, I propose this: If not friend, then why friend shaped?  Thank you for coming to my Ted talk.
Don't feed the bears!   They'll try to domesticate themselves.... aggressively, and we don't have the time or resources to tolerate that anymore. 😅
would have been quite epic go pro shots, bear mouth view.
So did someone get the GoPro away from the bear?
Are Yogi and Bubu retired? 😱
I would like to see the footage from the bear cam
Ton, the Bears are not allowed to break open the trash cans and they did it anyway, it's practically a crime. Of course they would try to destroy any evidence, that includes your gopro.
Bear: that's my go pro now
Bears are interested in pick-a-nick baskets? (Closed captions @1:18) Sure that wasn't a Boo-Boo?
Gopro😢
Literally waking up in 4 and a half hours to go to Yellowstone for 5 days
4:55 I bet LockPickingLawyer would feel proud of you for saying it like that, I wonder if there are bear resistant locks?
Tom, you’ve missed a mention of Yogi, the bane of Mr Ranger's life and “Smarter than the average bear,” plus his pal BooBoo 🤪
One of my favorite security cam vids was the one where a brown bear finds something delicious inside of a wheeled dumpster outside of a pizzeria and wheels it out as takeout dinner.
Finally something I knew about before Tom posted about it
Bear teasers
Idea for a new superhero: GoPro Bear
Excellent ending
for a moment i thought the title and thumbnail meant something else
Don't put peanut butter on a GoPro!
To be fair, I feel it's probably more laziness on the part of the tourist than stupidity...
I saw that coming the moment you said the gopro was going in there🤣😅.....are they going to get your micro sd card out of the bear "deposit" and mail it to you?....would love to see the footage if so
RIP GoPro
When I was a little boy, My parents took me here after our family Yellowstone trip. This was a really cool place as they would allow all of the children that were there for the day to go into the enclosure (without bears) and hide the food/snacks for the bears to find. It was like a weird easter egg hunt where you were the one placing the food and watching a 600-800 pound bear find your specific piece of food that you placed.
"The wilderness isn't so wild anymore". It should be wild right😀
No GoPro were harmed in the making of this video (that was paid actor, a dummy GoPro).
Don't put the gopro in the water... Tom is not looking for sponsors with that copy. 😊
Must protect your picinic basket
Bear: RIP GOPRO (pun intended)
I guess there's many people that "smarter than your average bear" does not apply to 😂😂😂 Unfortunately I can't say I'm entirely surprised by this, but hearing it from someone else just makes it that much funnier SuperVinlin
Sign:"DON'T FEED THE BEARS" Me: That Sign Can't Stop Me Because I Can't Read!
Bear with a go pro was not on the list of things i was expecting to see today
I watch the Katmai NP live bear cam everyday, those lil cubs stir so many emotions.
hehe good bear
I could watch an entire show of Tom Scott telling bears what to do
Rip gopro
Great video!   Bears are *very* intelligent!   I remember seeing footage of a bear trying to get food from a waste-container (I can't remember the exact shape of it) but it literally "posted" one of its cubs into the entry-bit of the container (just as you would post a letter) and the cub grabbed the food and popped it out to the big bear waiting outside!  Amazing!
Noted, bear resistant = iq human check
I guess I’m not going to yellow stone because I would not be able to not feed the Teddy bears
23 more Mondays to go😮
Sooooo.... To stop bears getting food for free we are teaching them gambling. 😂
We gonna find ourselves some picnic baskets.  Damn it's locked. Imma taking my frustration out on this shinny toy.
I misread the title and I thought it was talking about if the bear survived. I want to see the world where there is a 1 hour test to see whether or not a bear is bear enough
I feel like we all missed the obvious foreshadowing.
Can we please get the full go-pro video?? I wanna see what the inside of bears mouth looks like while it's ripping apart the camera...
so funny that off the testing material and snacks, the bear was like "oh hey this feels different, souvenir!" and just nabs the go pro xD
I love how it looked as if the bear was checking himself out on the gopro 🤣
Homeboy was literally drooling trying to get into that bin man. He was *hungry*
Tom is surely keeping the bear safe and tidy to record the right decision he made to make the bear feel protective.
I love bears - cool video
I just wanna hug that bear so bad
Hey Tom, did you end up getting the GoPro back?
It's surreal to see you cover places I've been too! I hope you are doing well!
22 videos to go
Very interesting video. It's funny to see a bear do CPR on a trash can. Also RIP GoPro :D
Bears are just big doggos, you won't change my mind.
I LOVE THIS
What's the wording on the insurance claim for the gopro? A bear ate my camera?
highly doubt anyone will ever see this, but i actually work here!! me and my coworkers have actually been waiting to see when this video would come out bc we also wanted to see the gopro video, also great to see all the hard work our bears do getting some recognition!  for anyone wondering, the bear performing CPR on the trash can is Coram, and the bear who so kindly drowned the gopro is Bo. we were watching our bears for the rest of the day to see if any of them pulled the gopro out of the pond (they didn’t)  …and yes, we did know it was likely it would be taken into the pond. that’s our bears’ favorite place to stash things.
By by GoPro. That bear out smarted you.
There's a grizzly bear sanctuary outside of Bozeman Montana that I went to once. They house bears that for various reasons can't be wild bears. Now, fun fact, a Grizzly is a type of brown bear just a really *big* type of brown bear. I didn't get to see this feet myself but the guide said that to demonstrate what a grizzly can do they used an earth mover to place a 4 ton bolder on top of their largest bear's favorite treats. The bear casually tipped the bolder with one arm and scooped the yummies from underneath with his other paw. The ranger said that if you want to know if a bear can get into something, ask yourself if a smart 7 year old kid that can bench press a truck could do it. If the answer is yes than the bear _can_ get in it.
I’ve been to that discovery center!!! Highly recommend to anyone visiting Yellowstone cause you’re very unlikely to see either animal during tourist season in the wild.
The bears in one section of Yosemite learned to smash open canisters by rolling them off 2,000 foot cliffs. It's amazing how smart they are. Nothing is "bear proof"
Thank you for the Yogi reference.
Holy crap! I’ll be in West Yellowstone/Yellowstone on Wednesday and into the rest of the week!
"When I go camping, the bears put *their* food up in the trees." - Louie Anderson
well go pro can say for certain that their devices are not bear resistant.
Oh boy do I love bears
I hope you enjoyed yellowstone!! 😄
I live about 30 minutes from West Yellowstone (Island Park, ID) and had no idea this bear testing site existed, very cool.
It was really cool meeting you! I hope they were able to get that camera back and send it to you.
Hmmm, I'm not sure what the evolutionary advantage is of nature producing bears that instinctively know how to find and destroy the most expensive piece of tech they can get at... but they do seem to be quite good at it! (Future Ewoks perhaps? 😂)😂
Rip to that GoPro
Omg I love that the bear runs off with the camera 😂
Bear Tested, Human Approved™
Algorithm
ALSO, tourists keep forgetting the animals are wild and will kill....
I saw a chart showing "Vehicles Damaged by Bears" per year, with a sharp drop off.  The last line of the caption read, "Another factor: some bears learned to use the door handles to enter the cars without causing damage."
there's a guy around here... one guy... who has been doing the job of this whole facility for decades.
Bear vs GoPro ... spoiler alert, the bear wins 😅
"that's not ideal..." 👍
RIP GoPro
I don't think the gopro could bear it any longer.
RIP Tom’s GoPro.
"That's not ideal" Ha, ha, ha, haaaa!  I am going to have to remember that remark when I am having difficulties.
should have bought the bear resistant GoPro
Dang how much did that Go Pro snack, set You back?
Euthanisation is a horrible word, theres nozhing good in death!
I love the air among the staff like "teacher who is proud of a difficult student's emotional and academic progress"
so real
Understatement of 7/17/2023: "Not ideal."
"That's not ideal". Thanks Tom. 😂
"No Bears were harmed in the making of this video... GoPro's however..."
Seeing a bear do CPR is a landslide funnier (in an endearing way) than I thought it would be
As glad as I am to know my trash can isn’t bear proof, I have to admit Idk what to do with that info
hm
I wondered why we hadn't seen the go pro footage yet.
I tried to use a bear resistant garbage can once. I got confused and asked how to, and was told I just had to be smarter than your average bear.  Turns out I’m barely smart instead.
i saw on YouTube how a bear was stealing honey from a producer, so he set up a trial of different types of honey, the bears palate was high end.
"That's... not ideal."   Fantastic response.    Thank you, for helping to educate people about wildlife safety and respect.   Living close to Banff, in the Canadian Rockies, I can't tell you how often we see tourists trying to get way too close to wild animals.   Most of the time, the tourist has a harrowing tale to tell their friends but, too often, the interaction results in an animal having to be put down because humans have stepped over the line and proved your quote regarding the overlap of animal / human intelligence.
a bear doing CPR on a trash can was not something I expected to see today. Thanks, Tom
My brother in Christ come to Bozeman I'm sitting here waiting oh wait you're gonna fly out of here I know this town
Next season on the technical difficulties they need a bear
Does anyone know what microphone Tom uses?
Tom Scott's "Bear with a GoPro" is the sequel to Tomska's "Baby with a Gun"
Intriguing! Bears definitely deserve more credit for their intelligence than what they get. Sorry to hear about your GoPro 😆
I- there is a *diagram* of how to access that bin literally right on it! Overlap between the most intelligent bears and least intelligent tourists indeed.
That bear wanted to start vlogging.
yer ma
"we're very hands off"... Let's put a human made trash can in there with our... hands. Cool story. Why are we trying to protect dumbass humans again? Why don't we be more "hands off" and let nature do nature, humans are part of it.
"Theres a considerable overlap between the brainpower of the most intelligent bears and the least intelligent tourists" 😂
That saying is one of my favourite ones ever. There is a considerable overlap in the intelligence of the smartest bears and the dumbest tourists.
"Thats not ideal" he says
Does this hurt the Go Pro?
The GoPro was not bear-resistant...the bears couldn't resist playing with it!
They need more land for the bears in my opinion
We all saw what Cocaine can do to a Bear 😂😂
You could call it a "labearatory" test
Take that @VivaFrei … you had a squirrel steal your GoPro … how about a bear?
So how did Tom Scott retrieve the GoPro
Unless you put cocaine and honey in it NO bear will f with it for even close to a hour😅😅😊😊😅😅😊
How did you get the go pro footage back after the bear took it?
Hey the bear just wanted to post his tiktok video
3:18 POV: a bear gives you CPR
I heard of a bear, that is smarter than your average bear
Euthanised? Hardly.
Sweet Yogi reference!
Just send the bare the bill
He didn’t want to be recorded
Did that GoPro survive to record another day?
FETCH! WITH RUF RUFMAN!
I love bears so much. They're just big goofy hungry fellas.
4:39 Came here to repleat this saying! Whoever said it, we all know it is true.
He suggested that the bears would lose interest in trying to get in if they kept failing. If the bear was put there because they were breaking in and stealing food then isn't that a way to recondition them so they can be released again? I'm guessing there are problems with releasing the bears, I feel like he could have touched on that (maybe he did and it was cut).
Another banger from the tomster
fantastic video
That’s a pro bear if I’ve ever seen one.
that bear must've been like "oh they're giving away free go pros, so nice of them"
that point about finding the fine line between bear-resistant and convenient for humans couldn't be more true, we have bear resistant trash cans up here in northern colorado, the strongest ones are always a pain in the ass to open because they use overly complicated locking systems that don't like getting dirt in them
I’ve heard or read that quote as well. Maybe from the book “Hey Ranger!”
5:18 I’ve watched this part way too many times, definitely worth a yt ‘fails’ short or something. Just your sad _British_ distress XD
Bear “proof” garbage cans are expensive and not really totally bear proof. I found a electric fence around the garbage cans works very well.
that bear could use a manicure
Did you get the GoPro back?
riddle me this, howd you get the footage from the gopro back?
Kevin Costner isn’t in this episode.
"The CPR method" and "clean up on aisle four"   great sense of humor! Love it.
Don't feed the forest people (bears)
Give a bear time and he will get into anything....i know who im having on my team for the world bank 🤑
It would be interesting if the Bearsuit (or an exact replica) made by the late Troy Hurtubuise can be tested here.
Maybe replace it with a bearproof/waterproof go pro. With your life you may wanna add fire proof too.  I grew up in the middle of nowhere in Alaska. Back in those days, we would store food in 55 gallon drums with a locking ring to keep the lid firmly on. You had to use 2 wrenches just to get those things open!  Bears did the CPR method on them. We would find them crushed like a beer can and the lock ring mangled. Out of orneryness, I always put the really good stuff in the bottom so they would have to figure out how to partially uncrush the bareel to reach the eldorado at the bottom.
I feel like Tom’s reaction to finding a bear in his tent would be ”That’s not ideal.”
If I go hiking and camping there I'll make sure a safe container is on my list of bear necessities.   (sorry)  😂
I wonder if a go pro makes a noise that we can't here but a bear can.
Bear 1; GoPro 0

"That is a bear with a GoPro"
this video passed the bear test
Hey tom? Your "making flapjacks" hand movements while you talk are very awkward. Watch some materials regarding public speaking so you can do normal things with your hands while you're speaking.

i love everything about this video and now demand a full feature length documentary
Real life Ron Swanson..
GET THAT MAN AWAY FROM THOSE CONTAINERS!!!! The ONLY reason he's testing them is to make sure the bodies of his victims won't be found!!! He's DEFINITELY a cereal killer.
fascinating
Can't belive it stole your go pro, it BARELY gave you a chance
The absolute stream of drool coming out of the bears mouth 😂
This video is weirdly facinating
The trash can must have the bear necessities
Was hoping so much for footage in bear's mouth
Yogi Bear : It's because I'm smarter than the average bear.
From a country that doesn’t have bears I’m shocked that their claws are that thick and long. 😮
How did you rescue the video from the action camera?
"That is a Bear with a GoPro!" has to be an all time Tom Scott qoute lmao
You seem like a weakling... Bears are cool though
"An acre in size," the guy says. As opposed to "an acre in color"? "An acre in smell"?
Insurance form: How did the GoPro get destroyed?  This is going to take a while
Having very similar problems with Dingos on K’gari (Fraser Island) at the moment. Good idea
The Grizzly & Wolf Discovery Center is a great place. We used to take our daughter every time we stayed in West Yellowstone.
IF NOT FREND, WHY FREND SHAPED!?
I have to know if Tom or the producer writes the initial script...  i.e. who add the famous 'picnic basket' line?
Any footage on the gopro?
I got to watch a demonstration of this once! The cooler lasted all of 5 seconds
Poor Yogi I knew him well.
I work for Montana Fish Wildlife and Parks and oh boy, that quote is to real with what I see on the daily.
Didn't even know that was a thing learn something new everyday.
My dad said that line about intelligence  when i was a kid, but it was about children and adults.
Damn Cocain BEAR!
Tom, hopefully you'll have time to visit the Grand Teton mountain range in Wyoming while you're out that way.  It's absolutely breathtaking, as is Yellowstone.
It looked like the bear was giving the trash can CPR.
love the bear at the end with the camera
I suspect the reason the bear went for the GoPro was the lithium battery.   I have read of them smelling the lithium.   I have seen hunting cameras they have have opened up and got the batteries from.
Bear was smart enough to recognize the camera as unique, not typical. Seemed like it was curious about it
A fed bear is a dead bear
When will bears figure out how to pressure humans into opening those containers?
Guess this stuff hasn't changed much, just a metal box and a latch/lock that the bear can't access. I remember seeing these in campgrounds ages ago. As far as engineering goes, a bear isn't putting much force on it at all.
after the bear got the honey and peanut butter it was looking for desert, Be a Hero, Bear!
I could watch an hour of this!!
4:42 i was going to give this quote if you didn't! i look around and i am convinced i am not the same species as these humans.. and behold, i am a dinosaur. i was a T-Rex all along.
Bear wanted to be a youtuber like you.
The only problem i see with this, is that the bears that have been in this “zoo,” if u will, for a long time will try different methods than a wild bear would. The bears in captivity have seen many containers and believe through trial and error that, for example, the “CPR method” works best, whether it really is or isn’t. So my point is that i’m not sure the products that are tested have been tested with different methods of entry a bear might come up with
Thanks Tom, that was brilliant, Cheers
the GoPro definitely died, right? if it didn't, that would make for a GREAT selling point!!
time zones?
I see there is footage from the GoPro, so presumably you got it back? Now I'm curious to see what it looks like after the "play session" at the end.
Could hire some bears to wash go-pros. What clean creatures!
I was there 2-3 weeks ago.
Not the best advertisement for gopro
All Lifetime coolers are bear resistant
THE CPR METHOD :O omg it's like the're some highly qualified trash can technicians! So cute:0
Mark Hamil had an interesting career change I see
R.I.P. GoPro, too bad, would have loved to see that camera angle.
CPR method! I'm ded
That GoPro had 4k footage of Tom inside a real alien spacecraft and his meeting with Bigfoot.
Go pro into the water it goes. THis makes me laugh and it really shouldn't.
23 videos left
STAY RIGHT THERE IMA BE THERE IN THREE DAYS
Bear with infinite prep time will always get the snack
I spent some time in Yellowstone two weeks ago. Such a magical place.
This seems topical for me, I’ve been really getting into backpacking lately so have done a lot of research on bear safety lately. The debate of how to store your food at night when food lockers aren’t available: do you hang it in a tree? Carry a heavy certified bear vault? Use a special Kevlar bag that the bear can chew on but not rip open? A combination of them?   It’s cool to see the sort of place where these methods are actually tested.
Wonder why it liked the gopro so much, it doesn't has food on it, so it can't be food motivated, it is novel, but it can't be that novel it is just a plastic cube, maybe just sheer curiosity?
I was disappointed when I learned that the Moose test didn't involve actual moose. Glad the Bear test didn't fail my expectations.
Hey boo-boo
0:10 The park does start a few hundred meters to the east , but rest assured that even in down town West Yellowstone you are in bear country (evidence being the bear container that Tom had a problem with) And you would need to drive several hundred miles to not see a bear proof container.  Tom - dude when you are out west again give me a call.  You went right by my house going to W. Yellowstone.  Hope you had fun touring the park.
A while ago I REALLY tried to find the original source of the smartest bears / dumbest humans quote, most people cite a ranger in Yosemite circa 1985. It definitely appeared in blogs and forums during the mid 90s and on tv before that. My best guess is it either came from a ranger doing a talk, then being cited by journalists or maybe even from a local tv special or interview since so many people know it. That said, I'd love it someone could tell me where it comes from.
05:23 Telepathic Bear: "Yes, I'm a bear with a GoPro. And I will end this one's career."
Tom: i have been to yellowstone before and have had a bear steal a car mirror, headlight, and license plate cover all in the same trip. They will steal what they can 😂
So, Tom went to the US to sacrifice a GoPro in the pursuit of education? 🤔
That's a brilliant solution to the problem of "problem" bears. Also, the amount of drool at 5:01 was clearly the signal that the bear had got the container open.
I went there
Of course, bears need to be the testers! I never knew this kind of thing existed.
Ohh... the GoPro was a GonePro!
The biggest lesson of this video, and of life in general, is "DON'T FEED THE BEARS."
Since we didn't get the bears mouth view:  R.I.P  GoPro.
The irony of humans killing so the offspring doesn't learn the bad habit of killing or hurting humans. Step up next in kill que, humans... bang.
Good thinking and a great use of Bears 😂. Good Subject
IDK, if someone brought this guy a bank vault I think he'd have to certify it bear PROOF.
I know how thick the plastic is on those cans. That bear is just pushing it flat with no effort. Scary.
"Don't you mean MY GoPro?"
That bear said I will be famous I have a new camera now and i'll make some bear in a pond videos for the youtube!! But for real what are the chances that bear would grab that camera and walk around with it? I bet it's because it either smelt like the food you may have eaten earlier and you didnt wash your hands, or its just because it smells like a human and that the reason why he grabbed it.
We visited the center recently and it is worthwhile. When the bears aren’t out they let kids hide the bear’s food all over the compound. They search it out, appearing to take cues from the ravens who watched the kids intently.
Hey, Bear!!! 😄
Are these red-team security consultants?
Bears don't like metric FYI
For his last video, Tom will undergo the bear test. It is the final test of everything he has learned.
Hey no complaining when you put a bear toy out there a the bear plays with it. :-)  Thanks for sharing!
Hey LOVE the video, but would you post a longer video of the bears just hanging out doing their thing? I just really want to watch those bears longer.
Your video's always are very good. The topics, the shooting and the representation. Thank you for uploading.
What they should look into is those crows working with the bears
The real story is how ballsy those crows are.
Just paint a goal line around the Trashcans... works for our Chicago Bears they won't go near it.
You don't ask the proper question.   How is the bear going to handle the go-pro, not can I attach it to the trash can.   They would have told you, drowning like all the other cameras they have taken into the enclosure.   By the way, great place, well worth the visit.
@TomScottGo If not friend why friend shaped?
Is this microwave bear tested.
I actually thought, for the whole day, that this was a Max Fosh video for some reason. It wasn't until I read the newsletter that I realized my mistake haha
P
Seems like Gopro didn't pass the bear test !
I loved the part where he talked about the overlap between intelligent bears stupid tourists 😂
4:42 Mind boggled at the tourist so stupid they couldn't figure out the bear latch 😂
I love how the bears get a new job trying to rip into a container for food
My uncle was the engineer and designer for the garbage can at 1:00 as well as the blue one later in the video. They are widely used all over western Canada in our national parks. I didn't realise the design made it all the way to Yellowstone too! He could be solely responsible for saving the lives of countless bears and possibly people.
rip go pro :P but ty for this Tom!
Every animal
I don't think it's an intelligence thing per se but a laziness. We could put things in a nesting doll of boxes so bears can't get it, but nobody is going to want to go through a dozen locks and latches just to throw away their apple core or whatever. So it's hard to design something a bear won't get into that people will want to use.
Your man got me at "CPR" method
“CPR method” hahaha
What chance have I of taking this as seriously as I should when my earliest impressions of bears are Yogi and boo boo?
i didn't know it's pick-a-nick instead of picnic. is this the american influence
Good Bear.
Only in motana
Don't feed the bears! Don't feed the bears! Anyways, this is how we feed bears to test if our anti-bear boxes work.
The bear wanted to be interviewed on his thoughts of the centre
RIP, your Gopro
Bears are strong animals
The go pro being savaged to me is the most ideal thing that could’ve happened! So poetic! Worth the money!
The pronunciation of “pic-a-nic" baskets was subtle but brilliant haha
Thank you for covering this Tom, I know your almost done and yet you're still knocking it out of the park with cool, fun, and educational concepts. I love this manner of protecting the bears and their wild nature, whilst also helping and educating humans.
It is classic British stoicism,  Ah yes this wild animal has captured my (probably) expensive camera and has dropped it in a pond surrounded by its mates, and I’ll never be able to use it or reclaim it.  And Toms response,  “Ahhh it’s gone….. that’s not ideal”
the bear "look what I've found guys! a new device that those humans seem to be using!"
A Bear with a GoPro in the water, well, how else is it going to learn more about the natural behaviour of Fish?
This was fun to watch! I've been going here since I was a kid, and I've started taking my own kids there.
3:44 pp
3:26 Get over yourself. You love the smell of your own farts. Pretentious
You're at the bear and wolf discovery center! I used to live there. west Yellowstone, not the bear and wolf discovery center
I have a feeling that at this point Tom buys Go Pros by the dozen
this video ended abrobödly
Weirdly, I am currently about a 2 hour drive from Yellowstone. My extended family is from Eastern Idaho, so we know not to go there at the height of tourist season. Please, let the bears be bears, the moose be moose, the wolves be wolves, and the buffalo, while they might look cuddly, are anything but. Please leave the wildlife alone.
3:04 - I died when he said the CPR method. Don't play dead, the bear will attempt to revive you.
bye bye GoPro.............................
So cool that they hire ex convicts to do the testing.
Tom it's his turn on the Youtube
If a bear records a vlog, does it turn back into a blog?
bear with more than an hour patience: *my time has come*
Does Tom go to America every summer then?
I used to work in the Yellowstone and there was a saying "A fed bear is a dead bear" and none of the park rangers like the idea of having to kill a bear because of people acting badly.
Well, at least I know that if I'm having a heart attack in the wild I just have to run to the closest bear.
Putting a GoPro on the container, what could go wrong 😜 Great video & kudos for them giving the bears a natural looking habitat to love in.
They were like cats, makin buns and drowning your valuables
Such a shame that the camera wasn't able to be recovered. That would have been great footage
I'd love to see the uncut footage of the go pro.
For decades I have made an annual camping trip to lower Michigan. It's a National Forest but there are no bears, no racoons, and the worst wildlife interaction we ever had was a landed and obnoxiously loud flock of geese one 5 AM. And we leave EVERYTHING out overnight: coolers, grills, booze, all of it. Not a care in the world.  Twice in the last year I camped in Ontario (Algonquin) and had to be bear attractant aware. I had no idea how much of a pain im the ass that was going to be. I was as diligent as I could be because I didn't want to be in that overlapping part of the human/bear intelligence Venn diagram.
The overlapping intelligence quote is one of my all time favorites
would be cool to see if go pro could develop a bear proof case
1:17 very subtle Yogi "pic-a-nic baskets" reference 😄🐻
Tom: gives a GoPro to a bear  Also Tom: that's not ideal!
did you loose the go pro ? :( we all want bear mouth footage :)
What happened to the Go Pro?
A British guy saying "garbage" unironically is too funny.
How do you explain that on your tax returns? £400: GoPro - eaten by a bear
Should have gotten a bear resistant GoPro.
we should just kill all the bears
RIP that gopro
The Crows are the G's haha they wait there to swoop in if the bears actually open something. :D
I got serious Bear-assic Park vibes
The bear just stole your go pro did your hands smell like food before you put it on the bin?
Bear had concerns about his privacy so he decided to take the camera with him
Aw, he made a bath toy out of your GoPro 🥰
Living in an area with bears is always interesting, worst is when a larger bear tries to get into a trash can and succeeds where a smaller one failed, and you end up with your trash going down 2 blocks, and the local PD wanting to give you a fine for littering
Did the GoPro die?
Tom, if you didn’t want your GoPro stolen by a bear then maybe don’t put your GoPro where bears can take it.
So, do any of these cooler companies send in not-that-tough coolers, hoping to catch a bear on a lazy day and snag a Bear Resistant®™ rating?
YOURE IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD!!!! I am watching out for you
It's time to find some picanic baskets with Yogi.
Just get rid of bears?
3:04 "come on! hang in there buddy! don't you die on me danmit!"
Ohh no there not looking for plastic the GoPro would be fine…
GoPro Ducky
Did Tom just say "Picnic baskets" with the Yogi Bear inflections? 😳  "There is a considerable overlap between the brain power of the most intelligent bears, and the least intelligent tourists."  Never a truer word spoken.  Frankly I think the average raccoon has more brain power than the least intelligent tourist.
Smarter than the average bear
LEAVE THE BEARS ALONE DONT GIVE THEM SNACKS THEY’RE BABY AND NEED TO BE PROTECTED
The 😂 GoPros demise !
In the subtitles at 1:17 they wrote "Pick-a-Nick" instead of Picnic. Is that the European spelling or something? 😆
I've worked out a design in about 2min that's super simple.. I've gotta patent this.. I must. It's genius!
Bears are hygienic, they will wash the Go-Pro before eating it.
cruelest joke nature ever played was making the most dangerous land predator of the modern age a fluffy round dog  Not fair
“That’s - not ideal” 🤣🤣🤣
Fascinating!!
1:55 Where they belong? You colonizers kicked them out of their homes and get mad when they return? Nah, let the bears do what they want.
Tom Scott as one of your last videos , please may you explain the flaws of Bluetooth and what you personally believe (if any) may be the issue with it, thank you !
I want to see the raw footage from that GoPro up until it died.
Challenging these bears with puzzles by putting their food inside a container which they have to work for instead of just giving it actually increases animal welfare because you stimulate intelligence and natural instinct. This is actually a great way to keep these bears entertained and far from animal cruelty
how did they get the go pro footage of when it was on the trash can when it was destryed?
Lootboxes for bears
say what Tom.. Pickernic boxes?!
Scary and adorable at the same time
There’s some footage I doubt you will get to review…😂
They are probably still doing it, but 30 years ago at the Yosemite guest services desk, where people check in to get their campsite, there used to be a corkboard full of visitors cars destroyed by bears who broke in to get food stored inside the cars. Their favorite was to climb on the roof and jump up and down a bit to get the windows to break/pop out, then they could get inside the car and grab the bag of food or cooler or whatever.
3:36 only reason I clicked is you posted so would be done right. 😊
Love the extremely British professionalism with the phrase "That's... not ideal" standing in for possibly quite some swears.
The Bear must have learned from Doctor Mike be like CHEST COMPRESSIONS CHEST COMPRESSIONS CHEST COMPRESSIONS. (Even goes with the beat of Stayin Alive!)
So glad the bears weren't euthanized and can still live a harpy life.
Tom is just going on Holiday using Tax laws for each video... And counting down to LEAVE
A bullet works well too, bear go night-night.
Luckily microSD cards are explosion resistant.
How many campers take fish along with them? Why not oblige campers to take safer lunch options. It wouldn't do most of us any harm to miss a meal or two.
CPR method lmao
Rip little gopro
"Yup that's a bear with a GoPro"  Priceless line.
should've played On Sight in the background
I don't know why but this is my favourite thing I've watched on Youtube for a while.
It seems to me that at least some of the footage was from a gopro... how many were used/survived/lost?
I have attended this center before. It is very informative! Good video as well!
Sleep well, GoPro.
This is one of those things that I’ve known of and dealt with my entire life, and yet only just now watching this video do I realize that not everyone has bear problems like we do here in Montana.
White hat bear
Really cool video.  I just wish it was longer!
I know you didn't have high hopes for the GoPro To, but I don't think that's how you give a grizzly a gastrointestinal endoscopy. Just saying, I'm sure there's more proficient and professional ways of going about that.
Well, anything made out of plastic, is, by definition, not bear-proof.
I was NOT ready for the CPR method haha
“That’s not ideal” -Every Human During a Bear Encounter
I'm so pleased you brought up the smartest bears against dumbest humans tale. It may or may not be true but it's a brilliant story
Mmmmmmh Go Pro.
Interesting addition to the budget XD  Expense: Replacement GoPro  Reason for expense: Bear stole and drowned the original :(
So do bears that failed the 20+ containers get released back to the wild? As in rehabearlitated?
Go pro bear, the bear with a go pro on him.
3:00 - Famous last words! 😆
Could we, perhaps, get the unedited gopro footage? i think that'd be fun to see... the vloging bear
rip gopro
Yellowstone is like a completely different world. Its amazing and Id advise everyone to visit.
As I sometimes go backpacking through bear country, this is very informative, thanks!
That single opening shot was brilliant, including the cameraman not getting themself in the door's reflection!
Great to see them care about the bears
Bear is not going to be interested in a GoPro.  Hey bear's got the GoPro....  Unintentional comedy gold.
the fact that it comes to this in order to help Bears that have been tainted by Human stupidity sorta makes me wish for a dystopian world where we Euthanize the idiot tourists, not the bears they corrupt
Its like a university for bears: be to intelligent for the wilderness, so you get transported to a facility where you have to do science on fancy contaoners for food
I love how from the bears' perspective eating human food is like eating one of Hades's pomegranates - you then get stuck in the human world for a season.
*finishes watching, immediately goes to Amazon to check how much a GoPro costs *
"that is not ideal" 😂
TOM!  You could've said Pick a Nick Basket!!
I love holding animals captive and forcing them to participate in science experiments, it makes me really happy. I especially love how it's all justified because they are rescue animals and treated to be as wild as possible. Don't worry its board certified slavery it's okay.
This bearguy looks like Oliver Reed...
Very strange to see the bears here and realise this is essentially them having their death sentences deferred
they could do this for humans, get nicked for stealing cars, right laddie , we gonna have you test all these cars see how tough they are, and no you don't get a waterfall and there might be tourists watching
I love how Tom stays so composed (dare I say British?😂) when the bear stole the Go-Pro: "Oh, no, that's not ideal." I would have used much stronger language 😂
Love the town and The Grizzly and Wolf Discovery Center!
I'm guessing that you didn't get any footage from the gopros?
Once I was staying in a cabin in Winter Park, Colorado and over night my friends and I heard commotion outside. In the morning we discovered that a bear had ransacked all the nearby “bear-resistant” trash bins including ours. I was surprised that the YMCA we were at didn’t use the kind of trash bins that all the National Parks do, the ones Tom shows in the video. I guess I hadn’t noticed on my way in the previous day.
Aw, Tom gave that nice grizzly a new toy!
This absolutely has nothing to do with transsexuals, so why did you ever do this video?  It's irrelevant.
Wait a second. If the bears are loosing interest or confidence in the reward of none is given, doesn't that mean bear  reformatories would be possible?
Having grown up around bears and in bear country, there's not a creature on this earth I respect more than the grizzly bear.
but... bears have always eaten our food, isn't that just their natural instinct? i don't imagine hunter gatherers were the best skilled at fighting bears off their food.
So no pic-a-nic baskets in Yellowstone then?
I need me some unedited footage of a bear.
I've been there! The wolves were definitely the coolest part. Also Yellowstone is just amazing.
In 2001 i watched a bear tumble a trash dumpster down the street after giving "cpr" to my buddy's trunk on his car. Bears are terrifyingly strong.
GonePro!
Thumbs up for the sneaky Yogi Bear reference!
😮😮😮🙂🙂🙂🎇🎆✨️🎇🎆✨️😘😘
Yep, you give them a gopro, they will prove to you it is NOT undestructable. But hey, you entertained a bear in captivity. That is something.
THIS IS MY GOPRO NOW 😂
Tom there's an island called North Sentinel Island. You should go there and interview some of the people that live there!
If they DARE to kill Yogi bear I shall personally blow up the Whitehouse
The Gopro was not bear resistant.
when are we gonna build the Tom Scott statue? xD
Vlogger Bear!  What will it record?
The volcano in Iceland is back
Calm down. They're bears... not people.
Bear: I'm going to be a Youtuber!
>teach bears not to open things >continuously reward the bears in order to maintain testing process No words.
Ok. How many days until a bunch of rich hikers to be mauled by bears?
Just add automatic pepper spray on the lid. It sprays the bear and an idiot who doesn't know how to properly open the bin.
alright
i was wondering why there wasn’t any footage from inside the trash can…
bears are different as heck, imagine having a pond that has infinite food.
I mean..  SciShow did this exact same episode, titled "Why Can't We Design A Bear-Proof Trash Can?", 3 months ago.
I live in BC Canada where almost all public trash cans, expect for one's deep in big cities, are bear resistance, I never realized how weird it looks if you've never seen it before
Nature's can-openers.
Having a GoPro in that trash can was honestly for Tom just the bear minimum
"That's not ideal" 😀
Worth watching just for the bear with a gopro at the end :-)
Has the Pelican cases company submit their products to the bear test?
Chest compressions? @doctormike has entered the chat
Tom Scott was in my town?! How cool!
"Next week, I look for a stunt man to find a memory card in a bear enclosure."
The average intelligence of a bear and of a human are comparable, save for vastly different language processing capacity. The tourists who can't operate the container have the advantage of highly dexterous hands which these locks are designed to be operated by, and they have lived often longer than these bears have been alive in a society which trains them how to open containers like these and operate other similar devices. These humans are surrounded by technology like this and use it constantly. The human has a far easier time getting into the container than the bear does. The only advantage the bear has aside from its intelligence is high strength and weight. To some extent the bears may be more determined to get inside because they don't have much else to do, unlike humans whose lives are saturated with activities. But to some extent, you're just stuck with the engineering difficulty of keeping a bear out while allowing in a human of half the intelligence or less.
I believe their sincerity, but 1 acre cannot be enough for multiple bears, it just cannot!
This is just Portal if Aperture Science used Bears as test subjects.
Thanks for keeping the videos coming Tom! 👍🏻
Bear CPR. OK, It's defo a good reason to wake up today. :D
If the bear goes into the Dutton Ranch, RIP will take care of them.
"That's a bear with a gopro"...
not my main concern when it comes to bears
Im gonna get mauled by a bear cuz holy hell, these dudes so cuddleable
I feel sad for tom's go pro loss 😢😅
If so deadly, why does bear look so soft and cuddly?
I mean, bears have been tortured for centuries because they mauled families to death for centuries
The bear on top of the garbage can: "BREATHE DAMN YOU!"
I love the way Brits pronounce the word “beh”
You could say that they're smarter than the average bear.
GoPro: most certainly not bear resistant
LMAO, They're *SO* smart that we have to trick them to keep them interested, that's so funny!
That's not ideal.  Understatement of the year.
Did you get your gopro back??
Came for the quote, wasn’t disappointed.
Dang. Really wish I could have seen that go pro footage.
interesting business expense, fed a go-pro to a bear
I used to live close to bear country and this was a really nice reminder to camping trips I´ve had as a child.
Notice how he said "picnic basket" like Yogi does.
Bears be smart, people not so much.
As someone who spends a great deal of time in bear country, thanks for this Tom. Getting people to respect wildlife and to learn to live with and share their habitat with them and to NOT put them at risk is incredibly important. If you're looking to do something after your hiatus, perhaps raising awareness about such things would be of interest.
And offcourse there are ravens around
I like how well cared for these bears are, Respect to the team operating
Having lived in the mountains for a decade and now about an hour from where this was filmed, on the other side of the park, I fully forgot that this is weird to most people.  I used to sell those coolers to tourists entering the parks and have to explain all the different intricacies of how they would be allowed to use them. A Yeti, for example, must have 2 padlocks added in order to be bear resistant. A bear got into a car last summer in my town, ripped it to shreds for whatever yummy snack was hidden inside. Can't put the trash out the night before, has to be morning of pickup. All the cans in town are similar to the ones shown in this video and yes, bears are paying a lot more attention than most tourists.
"That's not ideal" 😂
make it out of metal.
Do they run the test multiple times? Because it seems like this bears repeating.
Ah yes, the Grizzly & Wolf Discovery Center, founded by Mr. Josiah Grizzly & Mr. Jeremiah Wolf. 😛
That was tremendously interesting and a delight to watch.  Love that Tom has concern for the bears welfare too.
RIP gopro
that guy looks like shoenice if he was sober and healthy
❤❤❤😅
Bear put the GoPro in the water…
GoPro need to make a bear proof camera, this is the place to test it!
What happens if one of the bears escapes the habitat?  They've all been trained to expect food from trash cans.  Won't they end up teaching that behavior to their cubs?
These bears are more smarter then some social media users for sure.
Would been hilarious if the bear after failing to open the container goes back inside, then comes back out with another bear wearing a locksmith uniform, carrying a tool bag.  🐻 💼
Tom =0 ....Bear= 1 Go Pro .......BRAVO BEAR❗️.....sorry Tom❗️
i had to pause at "cpr method"  this has to be the funniest video in a while Tom miming a Venn diagram perfectly, the bear stealing the go pro. It's a 10/10
The bear drowning Tom's GoPro made me laugh so hard, I'm gonna be so sad when Tom quits
I like the intelligence overlap statement just for the bear to ruin the camera which “bearly” got any worth while shots 😂🤪 oh how right you were!
Can’t wait for the bears to learn how to use selfie sticks
the bear with the go pro reminds me of bear scares from family guy
I know in reality they are big scary monsters that can kill you in seconds but watching that bear give CPR to a trash can made me laugh so hard
Best GoPro sacrifice ever. 👍🏻🐻 🇬🇧😁
A GoPro was harmed in the making of this video. (Please send an ambulance)
F in the chat for toms  gopro
The Gopro did not pass the Bear test
Had an encounter w/a bear and a dumpster before a bear-resistant model was put in place.  Went to haul out garbage and just as I was going to swing the bag up and in, the bear stood up from inside.  We looked at each other a long moment and then both left the scene by silent agreement.  The bear seemed to do a sort of flip turn over its left shoulder while I just did a 90 degree heel turn and marched back the way I'd come.  Brown bear, not grizzly.
The bear does likes its privacy, so no go pro
We went there. Our hotel was right across the street at the WorldMark. I left the windows open in the evening and you could hear the wolves at the Discovery Center howling at dusk.
I mean, I'd also much rather CPR a trash can than try to chase and maim some live food.
Fun little Yogi Bear reference with the picnic basket line
the bear: ARE YOU READY FOR MY CLOSEUP!?
1:17 time stamp is a Yogi bear reference! No UK person says pic-a-nic baskets like that 😀
That's... a bear with a GoPro... Yup, that's a bear with a GoPro.
How did I know that when I saw a bear, it would be in my home state! It's almost as much of a dead giveaway as "The Toxic Pit with a $3 admission fee."
As a person who lives in the woods in Finland, I agree with everything this video is about.
The line "A fed bear is a dead bear" exists for good reason.
RIP Go-Pro.
🐻-what’s up YouTube! If this video gets 20k likes then I will do a salmon mukbang with Tom Scott!
Rip your gopro
It turns out that if you 3d print a cat flap you can unintentionally do a similar thing with badgers.  They are stronger than PLA.
Tourists who go to Yellowstone seem to be ✨️Extra Special✨️ if you know what I mean. C'mon guys this isn't Disneyland, the animals WILL kill you, or at least try, if you give them the chance
RIP GoPro - that's one expensive bear toy!
GonePro
If I saw a bear doing CPR it would go like this.. Me : "LOOK THE BEAR IS TRYING TO SAVE THAT GARBAGE CAN'S LIFE!" Tom : "No, it's just trying to break it open."
I am surprised, that the go pro didnt have any footage on it.
Kuma-Kuma!
Reminds me of the Samsonite commercials of the 70s with the gorilla.
This is honestly one of the best videos Tom has ever made, just delightful.
A fed bear is a dead bear.   Thank you for this video, too many tourists have no idea the consequences of their actions when it comes to wildlife.
Were you able to get your GoPro back from the bear and if so, do you have pictures of it?
Do not put the GoPro in the water, bear >:(
I mean the stories of galaxy brain tourists walking up to bison lately so I have no doubt there are people that can't understand a literal pictorial instruction on operating a trash can. The gopro ending was funny =D
Bear wanted to be a youtuber too.
How do you fill out the insurance claim form for the gopro.....!
Can we please get the uncut gopro footage?
Tom Scott talking about bears? This week is off to a brilliant beginning.
That bear was fighting to save the trash cans life!
The thought of bears being "employed" to test all the loads of products under consumerism is sad. Do we really have to have that many bear-resistant products? Isn't it enough to have like 3 bear-resistant models of each product?
I'm from Australia but now live in Canada... People keep saying how dangerous Australian critters are... I never cared there... but here in Canada... Bears, Moose, Mountain lion type things... IT'S SO MUCH MORE SCARY AND DANGEROUS!
the paper towel thing is to avoid touching dirty metal. bad for the next person tho.
Viel Glück Sascha Huber ;D
Bin there 😂
I guess gopros go on the list of "not bear resistant" 😂
Even the bears know about CHEST COMPRESSION CHEST COMPRESSION CHEST COMPRESSION
You yalked about those trash cans like theyre special, but you can go to local city dog and children parks where i live and see at least one.  Theyre super annoying when the latch is covered in spider webs. Which is usually all the time diring the summer
Bear paradise!!
If Tom survives an hour, he passes the bear test.
Good to see that they are clever and determined on top of being faster than Usain Bolt 🐻👻
Only one
A 'Bear'nesesity of plastic containers!!! He he 😀🚂🚂🚂
That's... Not ideal - Tom Scott 2023 RIP GoPro Thanks bears!
Huh, I thought GoPros were able to survive literally anything
Channelling your inner @RealCivilEngineer with that last line! That's not ideal.
This video proves that bears are more intelligent than most of the Americans! :D Low quality education rules in USA. :P
Even if Tom could get the GoPro back, it's not clear he'd own the footage shot by the bear :D
If those bears escaped they'd be the greatest menace to society ever
Over 400,000 views in 3 hours Tom. Just brilliant
"funni camera, me utuber now"
AYYYYYYYY TOMMY BOY! Love the "pickuhnick" basket reference. ♥
Why not an Insta360 for this situation over a GoPro?
Awesome video. Thanks for sharing
I was here a week ago holy crap
hehe big raccoons go brrrrr
Didn’t he realize those bears speak Spanish?
We are going to miss you Tom
This video has survived the bear test
'Pickernic' basket eh? - this Booboo's ears picked that one up . . .                                   : )
@1:20 pic-a-nic baskets. I love it!
Correction There is no proof that bears teach their young to attack humans in their mom mauled a person,as they rarely feed on humans  They see us as a threat . This is only a theory and thousands of bears with cubs have been killed just because we “ think” the bears cubs may suddenly start killing humans! It’s wrong and it’s idiotic ! 3:47
Idk, but I try to avoid your videos now... BUT bears man, who doesn't love animals
4:42 was my favorite bit
The cpr method. Love it!
Oh, I really hope you went to Kiwi's while you were in West Yellowstone.
Rip GoPro
big dogs
It's the lock picking bear.
Bringing back memories for me my going to my favorite place to visit during family vacations? (There was also another place that let you drive around with bears surrounding you)
Apparently the bears are getting a Ph.D. in Container Destruction
Another YouTuber would have titled this ‘I accidentally gave a bear a GoPro’ or ‘how a grizzly stole my GoPro’, but Tom always seems to respect the seriousness of his videos and the people in them.
I vividly remember this being an episode on Fetch with Ruff Ruffman. Ah the memories. This is so cool to see!
That's... not ideal.
I’d probably give up my already eaten food too, if a bear started cpr-ing me. 😂
1:18 I was waiting to see how long it would take for a yogi reference
GoPro can probably add "bear-resistant" to their marketing now
They do say never work with children or animals.
GoPro BEAR!!!! WOOOO
“It’s gone…  that’s… not ideal.” 😂
Kudos for adding subtitles for all your videos!
Rip gopro o7
Unpopular opinion: Solve the bear problem with Rednecks.  Bears are violent beasts that don't have reading or writing, nor basic manners. they should be hunted to extinction in the wild so rednecks may become the new apex predator, and forage instead.
I hope that GoPro was insured. XD
Bears are very dangerous and smart animals.  It is good that they rescued the bears rather than kill them. As for the bear proof products,  nothing is bear proof.  If they want it, they will get it.
Since both species have similar means of manipulating items, the solution has to be something that the bear can't do. And what the bear can't do is read. The mechanism and method has be be something only a human can do. TLDR, the boxes need to have a simple sequence that's based solely on text to resolve. Unlatch this, pry that, push this, open that, reverse to close. These bear boxes should be like the Bowley lock, since bears are distant cousins of LPL.
I feel that the bears in captivity are essentially being trained on certain ways to open these packages. Wouldn't this cause some kind of flaw in the testing? The way a fully wild bear attempts to interact with bear-proof products might be significantly different
Dr. Mike: "Chest compressions!" Bear: "Trash compressions!"  Also, very sad that apparently none of the footage survived the bear's interest in the Go Pro😕
Next episode: I tried fishing inside a bear enclosure.
I could watch this for hours, I love these bears
So what I'm hearing, and Tom I think this was your main point, I could be resuscitated by a bear.
YouTube recommended a video titled “can animals commit crimes?” next😭
This video lasted more than an hour.
Literally lootboxes for bears
Now that was fun!!  Looks like a 100% win-win to me.  Bear relocation and product testing.
Did insurance cover your GoPro?
Nice bear, taking your go-pro out and washing it :)
way to bury the lede with the thumbnail. very british thing to do
Rip gopro
Who else wants to see the last footage of Tom's poor (but brave) GoPro ?
"Yup! That's a bear with a GoPro!" is not something I was planning to mark off my bingo card this year
I’m literally going to Yellowstone in three days so impeccable timing
"That's not ideal"
So... GoPro... not bear resistant, I take it?
The Bear just wanted to be a vlogger
I wanna pat the bears so bad but it'd go against the concept of keeping them as wild as possible and I do also want the best for the bears so I can't
I can't help but thinking that the best solution would be if the tourists ate their food instead of throwing it away.
Anyone else got to experience they joy that is hanging a bear bag in the rain at dark
I love the Yogi Bear reference with pick-a-nick baskets! Oh, just me eh? Have I made a Boo Boo? 😂
Bear + GoPro might have been a great video ... Might!  ;)
Cool to see you in my backyard! Hope you got to see some cool stuff
Great one Tom! Especially found dunking the go pro funny at the end!
That is a bear with a go-pro i repeat that is a bear with a go-pro 😂😂😂
Bear with a gopro "Hey I'm Sarah, welcome to my enclosure. My job is to test bear resilient equipment"
A bear giving CPR to a trash can, nature at it's finest
Can't wait for that bear's TikTok video.
Maybe next time when I'm hungry, I'll try the CPR method
@0:50 "The wilderness isn't so wild anymore" Doesn't sound right for some reason. I think it needs to imply that the wild is moving outside the wilderness?
4:42 LMAO
That last clip at 5:18 is just gold. No Tom, that certainly is not ideal. I guess that cost you some great footage
They wouldn't let Tom bring his jetpack into the facility. Said it would disturb the bears. Thats why he asked about bears before entering the enclosure because he wasn't able to make a quick escape.
Gotta hand it to Tom's dry British humor - "that's... not ideal"
"Hey, what's up, I'm the bear"
Sooo..  did you go In and get your go pro back? 😂😅
RIP to the real hero. the GoPro.
o7 gopro
Poor Yogi. Without the camper's sandwiches
bear at end found a widget fidget.
That’s not ideal 😂
just let them have food, its natural selection after all
Did you get the go pro back?
4:48 How does one make a box that a butterknife can open but nukes cannot?
"that bear will kill us!!" "no problems, he knows cpr"
RIP go pro.
the bear wanted to destroy all evidence...
3:14 and 5:02 you can literally see the bear drooling, bless them
"That is a bear with a GoPro"
Seeing a bear performing CPR on a solid wheelie bin and making it buckle like that with no effort really drives home how heavy and strong they are.
Do you and Tod Cutler have a competition going about who's brave little GoPros survive or die in the most dangerous situations? Is that a British thing?
if not a friend, WHY FRIEND SHAPED!? 🥲
Had a bear saunter right up to our front porch the other day. It was literally staring at a sandwich through the window like a cartoon
Oh look, another Baldur's Gate 3 video… oh wait
i though oliver reed was dead
funnily enough you would pass for boo boo
"don't put the GoPro in the water" 🤣 no bear proofed camera
Bears are people too!
These are pro scavengers. The bears that couldnt hunt have all starved to death.
The bear just wanted to become a vlogger
Wait, so did the bear swallow the GroPro like a meal?
Tom, I love you said pick-a-nick baskets, please never stop being you.
Tom is invading that bear's privacy. He needs to pay up another cooler of dog treats.
It's pronounced, Pic a nic baskets.
"That's... not ideal."  Tom! Watch your language!
bears are generalists which play the rule of predators herbivores and scavengers
The only problem I see is that they create experts that could escape.
Go Pros are not bear resistant.
I spend a LOT of time in the mountains and I once had to coach a tourist through using a trash can. The "dumbest tourist" quote is too true
I work in a park, there is a sign on the bear bin describing how to use the handle. There is no other sign on the bin. Still everyday multiple people can't manage. I have a strong urge to be like "DO YOUR EYES DO THE SEEING THING?". The sign doesn't even have words lmao.   Also unrelated, but a ~6 month old bear stopped by and TRIED TO USE THE HANDLE ON THE DOOR. IT DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A MOTHER IT'S JUST SMART BY DEFAULT?
1:15 I see you Yogi :D
As an 80s kid, I'm glad there was a reference to picnic baskets.
Campers are going INTO bear territory. Punish the people, not the bears.
Amazing Video
I worked in West Yellowstone, Montana for 7 summers at The Playmill Theatre right around the corner from where you filmed your intro!
We have the same problem in South Africa with Baboons. They are way more intelligent though but obviously not as strong as a bear.
“That’s a bear with a GoPro.”
Tom bargaining with the bear not to put the go-pro in the water at the end really reminds me of that video trying to get a bear to leave her kayak alone
I had to laugh out loud when the bear not only took the GoPro in his mouth but also washed it off in the pond.
have they tried a ball shaped one?
That poor GoPro was destined for greater things.. !
1 dead GoPro
Your in my state and I didn’t know!?!
I find it interesting that this kind of contact is what drove wolves to turn into dogs, way back in pre-history.  Apparently that doesn't happen with bears, or it would already have happened long ago. So, what's different between the two?  They have the same environmental pressures:  scavenge off human garbage without direct confrontation or conflict;  then, get close to the humans to immediately get their stuff when they go to throw it out;  then get friendly with the humans, get them to feed your young directly, move in with them, go on joint hunting expeditions.
I NEED to know what condition the gopro was in afterwards
Gap in the market!!!! Bear proof gopros!!!! On a serious note.. cool video... its amazing how clever they are
If only the GoPro had recorded in the bears mouth, a free tooth check up. 🥴👍
love your  vids!
I'm both impressed and disappointed that you skipped saying pic-i-nic instead of picnic.
That bear really went to town on that GoPro. How did you get the footage from it? Do modern GoPros have an option to send the video recording to a computer while it's recording or did you have 2 GoPros?
Isn't common sense to not feed animals?
Bears are the cutest animal that coluld kill you in less than a minute.
"A large bear-like animal, most likely a bear, has wandered down from the hills in search of food or perhaps employment." - /watch?v=OkV_ztynYDM  1:15 Glad to see these bears found both
This is the bear equivalent of an amateur hacker being recruited by the NSA lmao
The GoPro did not pass the Bear Test.
"That's a bear with a Go-Pro"  "YO WHAT'S MY KODIAK'S IT'S YA BEAR!!"
If you're a misbehaving bear, you get sentenced to participating in capitalism
Kudos to this man for finding an excuse to feed bears syrup
Final score: Bears 1 GoPro 0
To be bear proof, it'd have to be a bank vault.
That bear is going to be a Youtuber... I'd watch it.
It's amazing what they can do with their bear hands.    Turns out bear hands make effective weapons. Especially if they are still attached to the bear.
i want to pass the bear test
4:29 The person who did that has the IQ of a bear.
Your videos are awesome! Sure going to miss them every Monday when you go on break.
I'm really glad this video passed the Bear test.
I highly recommend the book Fuzz by Mary Roach.  It covers bear-human conflict and the science behind it, as well as our conflicts with other wildlife and even plants.
*warning* : constructive criticism! i really like this video, but i’ve seen one from great big story, that to me had some more important details. like: -more details about de bears testing methods -why they give the bears only 60 mins -that the testing is recorded for the companies to improve their products -and that the testing is open to the public for everyone to see and learn why it’s so important as i said, i really liked the video, but i wished that there was a little more detail.
why have you started speaking American?
Spending 500 US bucks just to see the chubby brown animals rummage for food
Ah yes, the "I've fallen and can't get up"-CPR-open heart surgery-by bear pipeline
Tom also took this opportunity to test if the GoPro is bear proof or not not.
LMAO that bear with the GoPro. sad it wasn't recording anymore, that would have been the single most thrilling GoPro POV video i'd have ever seen.
Okay, I cannot be the only one that saw/heard the gentleman Randy appear and immediately went "Is that Mark Hamill???"
I like how Tom slipped a Yogi reference in there. Very sly, Tom.
Go pro is not bear resistant
This, is a ex-GoPro
You won't catch me anywhere near a bear. My entire country has less than a handful of wolves and 0 bears or other dangerous animals.
The time bar was set by Chuck Norris.
To bears CPR means Crush, Pound, and Rip apart.
_You call that a bear?_ *Siberian Bear proceeds to enter chat* _Now that's a Bear_
What a delightful video
It seems bears don't enjoy being filmed xD
Got to get to Montana / YellowStone, it looks so amazing. 🇬🇧
So this all just assumes the bear isn't hungry enough to check for other local "food sources", if the bear-resistant container proves too difficult?
I wonder if someone, who was super wasted, ever tried to befriend a bear and manage to dress it up with a hat and tie, only for subsequent campers to run in confusion as Yogi slowly approaches the pic-a-nic tables and baskets.  I bet chances are near zero, and probably the bear would just slap the human's head clean off if it was ever attempted. Still, a funny image in my head.
Bear 1 GoPro 0
"The bear's got it."  I love the tone of that sentence.
I'd think that a steel structure with sheeting 3cm thick would suffice, they'd bounce right off, wouldn't be portable though so I've no idea how to make a bear proof cooler.
How many more GoPros does Tom have?
This reminds me of that episode of Fetch with Ruff Ruffman where they try to make a bear proof/resisant picnic basket.
❤
Why is he training bears to be raccoons
All I imagine is that bear using CPR on me and just my guts coming out
Bears are not that smart
RIP GoPro. I'm surprised how smart the bears are with that CPR method.  Now how well would a bear do CPR on a human? Probably crush everything inside the chest but still?
"Don't put the go pro in the water!" Bear promptly puts the camera in the water. Kind of like my dog. "Don't fall off the -- aaaand you fell off the bed."
Bear takin selfies lmao.
no bro we should now let them come to the campfire just like the wolfs of old so we can slowly domesticate them.
Randy Gravatt looks like Mark Hamill
Tom Scott: They wouldnt care about a tiny piece of plastic, they want to reach the treats inside  bear: oh look, a tiny piece of plastic that USUALLY isnt there!
I would by random stuff certified by a bear if it means it can live
fun fact about bears they are caniblas too
Visit COSI in Columbus, OH
Huh!
I'm just surprised the bears kept rhythm to Staying Alive
Wow, a place I've seen in person more than once
Rip GoPro
The CPR method! 🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
I'm getting vivid flashbacks to that one episode of Fetch lmao
Those are just Water-Dogs, large ones mind you... with big claws and teeth, but still. They're just big dogs. Best one is the fact that Horses & Dogs were somewhat grouped by many natives. Small Horse was often just a dog, not the diminutive form of a horse - e.g. a stunted one.
who could have known that goPro‘s are perfect bathing toys for bears =)
A Fed animal is a dead animal.
You do know at the bear Jamboree they share knowledge about bear proof things and laugh wait till they discover fire😂😂😂😂😂
"Stay with me, bin! Stay with me! No bin's gonna die on my watch!"
You do know at the bear Jamboree they share knowledge about bear proof things and laugh wait till they discover fire😂😂😂😂😂
So bears are Batman? Give them unlimited planning time and they can get into anything.
I had to read “Fuzz” by Mary Roach for one of my classes and this was a topic that was discussed in it! Despite attempts at using these bear-proof cans and other preventive methods, it’s not entirely realistic for the average household or business place to want to put in the effort of bear-proofing their trash, leading to bears continuously coming into resident spaces looking for food. It’s very interesting how much human life has affected the way wild animals act, even if you’re not directly interacting with them.
Only Tom would go to Yellowstone and spend his time looking at trash cans
(:
RIP GoPro
Why don't you stream the video to an external computer? Seems an obvious solution.
I was just wondering with 20 seconds left why we never saw the go pro footage then like it was on que cut to the bear stealing your go pro and dropping it in water
"Never underestimate the intelligence of an animal you can teach to ride a bicycle" - Unknown
Mmm beir
Great ending!
too bad the camera wasn't 360 so you could get every angle
If the bears fails 20 times.. perhaps that’s them rehabilitated? However, can we afford to risk it..
Time to develop a bear resistant go-pro
"That is a bear with a GoPro." --Tom Scott, 2023.
They are accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums - meaning they meet the highest standards of animal care in the world continuously through regular inspections alongside such famous facilities as the San Diego Zoo!
"The bears are smart enough to not mess with the GoPro." And I guess the bear heard that.
West Yellowstone is a tourist trappy western American town, but the Grizzly & Wolf Discovery Center was definitely worth the visit when we visited the National Park. They also have a sanctuary for injured birds of prey which was fascinating in of itself.
lovely, interesting video to send me down the Tom Scott interesting things I didnt know rabbit hole again, but aren't you on a break? Saw a vid of yours, announcing a well earned hiatus of sorts
Looks like go pro recovery 😅
“Thats not ideal,“ in response to a giant grizzly bear destroying hundreds of dollars worth of video equipment is THE most British thing you will hear all day.
"That is a bear with a GoPro" made me chuckle
science bear! (samsonite gorilla bear!)
That's the coolest business model ever! Stress-testing products and saving bears <3
its my GoPro now  -bear
So after the guy explained why they put food inside the dummy trashcans, I'm thinking it could be sorta solved by putting a ton of empty, or disappointing bins out, maybe laced with a dispersion? And now that I wrote it out, I realized that people are probably gonna put trash in them anyway, cause its people🤦
Lovely video!
Its a GRIZZLY thought that you did this story - I cant BEAR it 😜
Good video, very enjoyable 😊
I just want to make a completely ordinarily ordinary pen and get them to certify it, bear proof pen
+
Is this where the movies with Donald Duck and those sneaky bears were shot ?
hey, I'm smarter than the average bear 😁
Well, GoPro failed the test ...
What a shame that GoPro had stopped recording; that would’ve been some amazing footage!
F for the GoPro
yesF
Rip to the go pro 😢
He probably didn't get into the gopro, which would make it bear proof
So GoPro's arent bear resistant
the few monkeys the learnd hand signals they did a iq test on they all scoord aroun 60 this is just like 4 monkeys and all different spiecies so there are very smart ones like with us humans out there that are smarter then the dumest humans
They look smarter than the average bear!
4:44 thats a GREAT quote 🤣
Deeply appreciated the subtle Yogi Bear "pick-a-nick" reference.
What tons of people don't get is there is a connection between bears and people, in behavior especially.  It is bad for the bears if humans feed them in much the same way welfare is bad for the poor.
Yogi Bear : It's because I'm smarter than the average bear.
Hey Boo Boo, let's go get us a gar-b-age can!
I really wish there could be footage of a bear licking directly into the camera lens.
That bear at the end was like "I'm Tom Scott... I'm filming a YouTube video."
They're just big smiley deathclaw puppies
Ok, now I am glad to see that if I play "dead" when I see bear in the wild, it will try to perform a CPR on me to "revive me". I so glad that bears do care about our health.😉
That bear deserved that go pro more than Tom did, good for him ❤
It's honestly an emotional experience to see Tom talk about a place I went to religiously every summer as a kid. Hope you're taking as much advantage as possible of filming by Yellowstone! ^^
End was the best
No way you might have been there when I was!
Someone get Doctor Mike on those chest compressions
This video cost a plane ticket and a go pro
Well, that should be the requirement for entry to national parks. Can you operate the trashcan? if you aren’t smart enough to figure out a trashcan, you’re definitely not smart enough to hike in the wilderness
As a hiker/camper who has needed to purchase bear-resistant containers, I really enjoy the fact that the industry tried to come up with fabricated certification tests for strength and whatnot, but they could never cover all of the possible bases so just resorted to “give the finished products to some actual bears for a while and see what happens” as the official “laboratory test”.
I just started laughing like crazy when the bear started cpr 😂
RIP in peace GoPro
They’re smarter than your Average Bear…
I just watched a video a bear gets killed by a few 9mm shots. He attacked people they had no choice.
3:14 bro he WANTS those treats
My new favorite line “that’s a bear with a go pro”
You know you've got English roots when you lose an expensive piece of equipment to a dangerous predator and describe the situation as "not ideal."
“Hey Boo Boo, let's go get us a pic-a-nic basket”. Yes, I heard that.
Smarter than the average bear.
On a 99% unrelated note: 2:06 Wilcoxon's carmel apple is the best icecream I have ever tasted, and the left over buckets make excelent plant starters.
Next video do it with a person
Tom’s video ideas are so predictable but so unpredictable at the same time
Tom's GoPro was 1 week from retirement.
That's not ideal.
I take it the gopro was not recoverable for its footage...
their claws are insane
Just a question from somebody clearly living in city: why leaving trashcans out instead of underground containers or keeping trashcans protected from bears altogether?
A coke camel bear. Something no one wants
I knew this was an issue, I had no idea they actually had a testing ground for bear resistant containers!
If the bear survives for an hour, then it's a witch. If it dies it was just a cool bear we killed
The more I know about various animals, especially other mammals, the more I realize that humans aren't actually that much more intelligent on average. Not to mention bears, even dogs and cats are about the same as humans. Personally I think the reason why humans have the advantage is because their 'growth' phase is so long. Once most people reach adulthood, it's much, much harder for them to learn anything. Humans have about 13-18 years on average. Most other animals grow much faster. It could also be why Orcas are so intelligent, aside from simply having more developed brains, they generally take up to 25 years to fully mature.   Something that always bothered me was the way people say "As intelligent as an 8 year old human" in regards to how smart a certain animal was... Do humans really get more 'intelligent' with age? At least from my personal experience, I'm about the same intelligence or maybe even less than when I was a young child. I obviously learned a lot since then and have plenty of wisdom from various experiences, but that doesn't mean I got 'smarter'. I was able to speak, read and write in English by the time I was 1 year old, fluently. But I never learned any other Languages effectively and still to this day, I can't seem to learn anything but English. Does that mean I'm 'stupid' or just not genetically predisposed to learning other languages? Or is it because I didn't learn as a child, so when I was a teenager and almost fully grown, I couldn't effectively absorb that information anymore?
Something something the bear will not take the camera.
How nice of you to spoil the video with the thumbnail, now I don't wanna watch it 👍
I fell asleep (or passed out) watching this, I'll have to watch it again later!  EDIT: I watched it again, love the ending!!
23 videos to go.
Looks like the he couldn't Bear to be recorded!!!😂
I love the subtitle people for spelling it "pick-a-nick" baskets.
I'm an Alaskan. There is no such thing as a bear proof container. Trust me when I say they will always find a way.
@ the end: ...that's not ideal... got a big laugh from me
I guess the bear does not like to get filmed when he breaks into stuff.... relatable :)
The cpr method is hilarious 😂
Bear "Tom gave me a new toy". :) Thank you, I hope they told no food in cars because bears can a do rip cars a part. :) Have a great week.
Great video!
Tom, bear with me.
I want a behind the scenes follow up on getting back the gopro
I hope that loss of the GoPro was bearable?
Feels like you are rushing through those last remaining video's to be able to stop YT😅 you've been uploading like crazy.
I was like: “where is the footage of the gopro?” And then i saw the bear walk with it xD
This video has remained up for an hour and, therefore, is officially Bear-Resistant! Congratulations on successfully thwarting the bears!
R.i.p. GoPro 😂
"That is a bear with a go-pro, don't put that go-pro in the water bear"
a large portion of humans are not as smart as a bear. its sadly true
If we applied the same rules to tourists leaving trash as bears getting into trash, that problem, at least would be quickly fixed.
5:17   Human: "The bears usually break into plastic containers, why would the care about another peice of plastic?"   Bear: "Huh, this plastic thing's new!  I'mma play with it." Human: "Ohh right, they're smarter than we give them credit for..."
Last 30 seconds are classic! 😂
If bears not friend, why are they friend shaped
OMG Amazing ❤ Greetings from Bengaluru, India 🇮🇳❤️
Not a good ad for GoPro, eh? :D I thought they are specifically made to survive such things. ^^
I read the thumbnail as "i did not survive"
Bear: Expensive GoPro, thanks Tom.
That's a bear with a GoPro - conveniently, destroying tom's equipment as if wrapping up loose ends in the Tom Scott universe.
So Now se know that go pros are not Bear resistant
Damn that's a drooly boye!  I love that they call it the CPR method. Those crows also clearly know there's going to be food soon.
RIP gopro
My cat claws my arms to shreds, but I’m 99% positive that I could take a bear.
The gopro was clearly dirty. The nice bear was washing it for you.
Video was posted 1 hour ago, so I guess it passed the bear test
The bear with the Go-Pro is the cherry on the cake!
That bear is sorted for life :)
i guess that gopro did not pass the bear resistant test huh
This is the funniest video I've watched from Tom (okay maybe second to the musical road video).  Unexpected, too :)
I was actual just there about a month ago. Small world
Cpr method was hilarious omg
Bruh as soon as I saw the CPR method I was like, 'domesticate these guys already.'   I hope one day, when I'm gravely injured I'll see a bear running out the back of an ambulance to give me CPR
Rest in peace to that GoPro. It would've made awesome footage of a POV of food inside of a container when tested by a bear if it survived.
I really enjoyed visiting the center on my trip to West Yellowstone, very informative
good that yogi won't be killed for liking picnic baskets
We can assume that Gopro is a goner
This video has passed the bear test.
Dear GoPro Warranty Centre...
GoPro: Can survive a point-blank Semtex explosion, cannot survive a bear.
Bear QA testers 😆😆😆
That GoPro is now GonePro.
This is what we call a "probletunity".
Like the child proof thing that the parents having a hard time to figure 😂
an hour has passed since this video uploaded, did it pass the Bear test?
Can confirm this video survived the bear test
Rubbish bins.
I wonder if there isn't a way to, instead of bear-proofing the container, to bear-proof the food. That's usually the way we get rid of pests like rodents, although unfortunately a very slow death. But we don't want to hurt the bear we just want them to either not sense the smell or if they sense the food be able to make it not eatable. Spray down you garbage with some detergent smell or to lock the actual scrap food into a bear-proof container. You dont have to lock away all your garbage, just a very small part of it. With time they learn or get bored.
the only thing it took away from this is that some people don't know how to open bins.
They knew the gopro was recording, they just don't wanna pay taxes
Love the crows just hanging around, waiting for the bears to do the heavy lifting 😄
To paraphrase Duglas Adams, anyone who claims something is completely bear proof underestimates the ingenuity of bears.
R.I.P GoPro
At 1:18, nice allusion to Yogi Bear…
A GoPro can do a lot, especially if you ask the manufacturer, but bear proof it is not...
if not fren why fren shape?
If bear dangerous, why friend shaped?
The cameraman always surv... oh...
he wanted to take a selfie <3
QOTD: “That’s not ideal”
Bear looking at GoPro  "What are this?"
what about hanging up the food in the tree?
"Pic-i-nic baskets"? I haven't heard that in a while.
Bears are a tough creature to beat in these..  Raccoons still win for ingenuity tho.. city of Toronto spent millions finding a raccoon proof kitchen waste bin.. found a design rolled it to the public with all but a parade declaring no more garbage raids. Took one night of use for video of a raccoon opening one. Cant beat mother nature.
Having seen {explicative-deleted} tourists tossing food to bears, it's wonder that we can afford the cost of managing wild bears.
GoPro confirmed NOT bear resistant. 😂
Massive awesome beasts.
New Tom Scott Plus idea: the "That's...  not ideal" series.  Clips from other YTers sent in, etc.  :D
If you did recover any footage filmed by the bear... it would be copyright free.
"There is considerable overlap between the intelligence of the smartest bears and the dumbest tourists."    Yep.
I love that this exists. I also find it funny that the bear would not be interested in a new toy, aka GoPro. Maybe they should sponsor you.
RIP go pro 🤣
When there are more crows than bears is it still a bear park? <3
If a bear is eating me does that count as feeding the bears?
I know a twink and he survives an hour with a bear every night
the GoPro is, in fact, not bear resistant
i want to pet the bears but i know i must not
Now it's a GonePro
Losing that GoPro must've been unbearable.
I love Tom’s videos because you never know what you’ll get. 😂
😂 The fate of the GoPro at the very end!  The bear: Look at meeeeeeee!
Ok no testing the bears cause they might get hurt, now the bears are all dead because that is what is keeping these problem bears from being put down u flakey azholz.
Truly the 3am YouTube video
i also imagine it provides good enrichment for the bears. kinda like those dog toys you hide treats in.
Happy to see you in my home state of Montana, Tom, Big Sky country!  As always, everyone, DON'T MESS WITH THE WILDLIFE , NATURE WILL KILL YOU , and please be kind to the locals!
Now I want to see the footage form that go pro...Thanks for the video
More 🐻 please
You think the bear has a LinkedIn profile?
Mr. Grizz sure does love helping with business...
23  to go man.. gonna miss you man.
What i get out of this video: 1) Apparently tourists may need video tutorials on how to operate trash cans. 2) GoPro may want to develop a bear resistant model to ride the wave
4:29 Bad habit of my old man.
Did you manage to salvage the unlucky gopro? I'd like to know if gopros are bear-resistant...
A friend lives up north in Canada and a bear tore through a door to get to some dumpsters.  They replaced the door with reinforced metal and the next time the bear went through the wall instead.
That bear was flexing the HDPE like a water bottle…..
Nice to see they have Superchargers on the doorstep
That is soooooo cool, ❤❤❤❤❤. An Mr GoPro knowing there was water ponds, why wouldn’t you purchase a water proof Go Pro. Lmao
1:05 We were on the verge of greatness, we were this close.
Been an hour. It survived
It proves the Rodney Dangerfield routine:  The bear took the picture.
Bear: Have GoPro, will YouTube.
this is the bear minimum
IF NOT FRIEND WHY FRIEND SHAPE
My favorite (real) lifetime warranty message of all time is: "[Company] will continue to guarantee the product directly, against breakage or defects in workmanship...  The guarantee does not cover SHARK BITE, BEAR ATTACK and CHILDREN UNDER FIVE."
The moral for me is there's a strong correlation between motivation and the utilization of intelligence, for both bears and humans.
Can't deny its a great way to test if products meet the "bear minimum" requirements  😄
If they put some weed in there I'll be their bear for free.
Bye-bye GoPro...
Huh- weird and yet it makes total sense for this facility to exist when given some thought.
What a great idea.
Congratulations to all the new channels out there!  Keep up the amazing work, and we're all excited to see the fantastic videos you'll bring to us next! Sending a ton of support and laughter to each and every one of you. Cheers to your collective success! 🥳🎥
Worth waiting to the last second of the video 😂
Bear 1 Tom 0
It bears repeating.
What a great wholesome idea! And the products will be getting the most rigorous testing possible, since these bears are proven to be especially experienced and good at breaking into containers (skilled, dedicated professionals)
The cpr method was both hilarious and surprisingly effective 😂
That bear liked the way your stuff smelled. Something about right to bear arms, and being British?
Thank you to the subtitler who transcribed the pick-a-nick basket reference 🥰
Too many Tourons thinking places like Yellowstone are petting zoos. So glad you and this organization are educating humans.
How can some animals be so adorable but at the same time so deadly?
Conditioning the bears to recieve No reward, isn't a good idea?
Just make the trash can open when it gets nfc power, problem solved
the bear doing "cpr" on the green bin has me in stitches, its soo cartoonish!
I have known about this place for a while but Im so glad that Tom made a video about it.
I take it the GoPro is no longer functional?
5:34 – 'That's... not ideal.'
That bear is performing CPR with far better form than any movie or TV show I've ever seen 😂
CPR method sent me😂😂😂 Perfect editing
completely off topic observation, but i noticed a large group of crows had taken up residence at the center. im going to assume they are wild and realised the bears were a means for easy scraps, and the bears just didnt seem to care. knowing crows, i wouldnt be surprised if they had managed to effectively socialise the bears into knowing when and where food was out, and theyd use the bears to get to it themselves  crows are remarkable creatures
5:19 Bear decided it's time to try noodling.
"That's a bear with a gopro"
"Not ideal" xD
I bet PETA _hates_ this.  beaRs iN PriSON, eNsLaAVed!
My job? I’m a Bear Frustrater
Don’t pet the fluffy cows!
Bear with a GoPro  What will he film?
This was a great video! It's great to see that they use these bears as both education and also for testing products. I spend a lot of time hiking in bear country here in CA, and you're required to being a bear resistant container for your food. We have a saying "A fed bear is a dead bear" because as you mentioned when they associate humans with food, the bear ends up getting killed. That ranger's quote is spot on - there are a LOT of dumb tourists out there that are dumber than bears.
1:20 Kudos for the reference to the Hanna-Barbera of my youth.  Now, that bear that got the GoPro. When can we expect to see his new YouTube channel?
GoPro failed the test.
That's his GoPro now 🤣
Bear country is crazy
Obviously you gotta check if your bear resistant containers can bear the bear. If it doesn't bear the bear, you better get your bearing straight and bear the embarrassment of your bear resistant container not bearing the bear.  I have a beard.
What a great idea for keeping these bears around to do something productive with their ill-gotten knowledge!
This puts a darker tone on Yogi Bear
Now we can confirm, GoPro's arent bearproof
"Can I put my camera in the trash bin?" "Sure." "Great!" "The bears will love it." "What?"
i hate bears because they are so cute and friend shaped, but so oh deadly
RIP go pro
I am a dispatcher for a State wildlife resources dept, and can not enumerate the number of  nuisance bear calls where people want a bear shot or "relocated" because the human complainant has surrounded their home with high calorie, easily obtainable birdseed feeders, nectar feeders, outdoor pet/ domestic livestock feeders, chicken coops, garbage cans, outdoor kitchens and kitchen waste compost piles. I have to bite my tongue to keep from telling people that the bear isn't in their yard, but they are in the bears former habitat!
It's a shame you couldn't recover footage from the Go Pro, would have been interesting to get a close-up of the Bear's Grills.
How'd he get the footage back from the GoPro?
and lef tists wonder why country folk like g uns.
Know we know where Joggy Bear went after his TV show - seams like a nice place with good food. No picnic baskets, but compromises need to be made.
Mark Hamil and Chewbacca have come a long way
Win for the bears 🤣
QA vs UAT
At least your memory card bearly survived.
if so destructive and harmful, why friend shaped
I'm fairly sure I could design a mechanism that no bear could open, but a fully capable human could. The problem is that not all humans are. Some have mobility issues due to injuries and diseases, and some simply don't have two hands or even two arms.
I live in a town full of supposedly smart people who (1) complain when bears come into town and (2) put out bird feeders. Yeah, we are in the overlap zone.
“There is considerable overlap between the intelligence of the smartest bears and the dumbest tourists.”  - Yellowstone park ranger on why it's impossible to make a completely bear proof trashcan
TikToks next viral stunt...bear test challenge
Nowdays everyone knows , that vampires  are secured from bears 🐻
Tim still fed the bear a camera lol it shouldn't be entertaining, but they're such entertaining and intelligent creatures.
😂
Bearifoc episode! 😊
How kind of the Bears to give CPR to the trashcan‘s :)
They're so fluffy and cute. One of God's sicker jokes.
Now it's a gonePro 🫡
"There's an overlap between the most intelligent bears and the least intelligent humans."  Bear:  I'm gonna eat this GoPro camera...
I visited the Grizzly & Wolf Discovery Center a few months ago! I live and work in Mammoth so it's super cool to see Yellowstone related stuff here :) (and yes, tourists ca be soooo dumb sometimes)
It's like nobody remembered that story about the mom that couldn't help her daughter being mauled alive by a group of bears awhile back.
So, I guess the GoPro footage was not retrieved :)
This video passed the bear test
Just wipe all bears from wilderness. Problem with bear attack solved. You may add but they hunt sick <insert animal here>. And I reply we can do that instead of them.
That bear definitely went pro.
rip gopro
again the corvids show themselves to be smart just hanging around the bear waiting for the free meal :D
Bear be like, This Go pro is now shell fish. Aw why it no open.
Tom, "Will a GoPro hurt a bear?"  Staff, "lol"  "Fair point".
As a medical student, I must applaud these bears' CPR technique - very nice and consistent!
RIP GoPro, you will be missed 🙏
4:42 genius
That bear has Tom's scent now, and associates it with an easy meal 💀
Grizzly bears are powerful, smart, fast, strong and way bigger then you think. I live out west in the USA. Be responsible and respectful in the wild. If you bring it in pack it out or consume it.
Who else wants to see the footage of the bear's mouth? 😂
Recent Tom Scott videos be like - "I will break the rules, so you don't have to".
Did you get the go pro back?
Leonardo DiCaprio passed the bear test.
Another great video. Thanks Tom
The problem with bears is that they are too adorable for our good! I spent all the video going weeeeeee litol fuzzy friend!!!! I hope I get to visit Yellowstone some day, it looks so beautiful!
Why don't they just have a code on the trash cans and a sign saying, "bears can't read, but we assume you can... change the code to 9396 to unlock, then mix up the padlock when finished". Surely there isn't THAT MUCH overlap that humans can't read or match numbers on a keypad to numbers visibly displayed just above the keypad?
I guess the video passed the bear test
If this innocent infant can survive for a day covered in meat while in this bears enclosure, it gets a certificate.
Bear in mind this is a bear country. 🤔
Well... At least (somehow) you got the footage from that GoPro 😅
Huge shout out to whoever does your subtitles. Yogi would approve.
I loved the subtle "Pick-o-nic Basket" 😁
Oh I love this place!
I have seen some smart bears and dumb tourists, I can say with confidence that the bears were smarter.
"not ideal"  I'm dead now.
I guess the gopro capsule isn't bear proof
Did Tom Scott just say Pic-a-nic baskets a la Yogi Bear?
What I've learned watching Tom Scott: - A GoPro looking directly at multiple suns worth of light & heat will barely notice - A bear can destroy a GoPro Either bears can defeat the sun or we just discovered a cool new set of rock paper scissors
I'm feeling reminded of the old tales of the Unseelie. If you ever taste their food, nothing else will ever satisfy you again.
"That's a bear with a GoPro" welcome to Siberia
I'm one of the keepers at GWDC! I'm so glad yall decided to come down and do a but on our bears!
This video is about to pass the bear test
Hmm, so stuff can't be made bear proof, only bear resistant. Similarly like in Software Quality Assurance (my area) - stuff can't be made bug free, only risk gets reduced.
Thanks go pro for your service in the bear enclosure. May your data be saved
Rip Go-pro You will be missed?!?
Those products were unbearable.
3:14 - That bear salivating in anticipation is as cute as it is terrifying.   These bears are way more experienced at opening these things than random ones in the wild, so I imagine this is a pretty harsh test.
At least they tried to make a decent selfy ^^
Wow, Tom, you've actually gone to a place I've been!  It's been years, so maybe things have changed, but while I did love watching the bears there, I also really got a kick from the actions and interactions amongst the bears and the ravens. The food is put out for the bears to find, but the ravens looked, too. The staff knew that, of course, so put the food under things the ravens had trouble shifting. Still, you could just see the ravens thinking things through, and they sometimes succeeded in getting bits on their own. They also, of course clued the bears into where the food was, and got bits the bears missed once they turned over the stones.  In the 1980s, I once hitch-hiked back to the lower 48 states from Alaska, and was always careful to check the wind direction when setting up camp. I'd make sure to eat well away from my tent, and would leave anything with the smell of food between me and the bears' likely line of approach. One morning, when I went to collect my things -- can opener, empty can, camp stove, pot, and spoon and fork -- I found almost everything torn apart like it was made of paper. Except the stove, luckily for me. I figure the smell of the fuel kept the bear away. I had spent that summer working at Denali National Park, and I knew what the bears could get up to with humans (Park staff have LOTS of stories.). I don't scare easily (that's not a boast: I've done many foolish things because of my lack of caution), but I was sure chilled with fear as I quickly packed up and got out of there. Bears tend to hang out in places where they've found any food.
man i love the Bear Test
You should title this "What happens when you give a bear a GoPro...or anything else" 😂
So if the bears mess up and get caught, they get to live in the Yogi Bear 3000 Simulator with free lunchbox lootboxes and hidden treats.  Truly, we have created bear heaven on Earth. 😂
I am hoping this gets mentioned but per Yosemite national park:   "A bear can read a food can tin in at least 73 languages."
They give you free hugs, they know CPR, they even wash your GoPro! Such friendly creatures. 🐻
That guy is the spitting image of a short haired Cody Lundin!
Did you recover the camera?
"bears are relatively smart creatures" Citation needed mate, Not saying they are not capable but so casually attributing intelligence to a beast that is so instinctually driven like a bear is seems short sighted.
The scenario stated about having a wild animal acclimated to being around people, then raising their young to also be comfortable around people, thus putting the animal at risk and may need to be euthanized: this is precisely the situation of the otter stealing surfers' surfboards. That otter was raised in captivity with its mother who had been overfriendly with humans. The cub had training then to be wary of humans, so was released into the ocean. It doesn't seem to have altered their behavior, and now that otter will have to be captured and kept in a zoo or sanctuary for the rest of its life. I don't think there's as many options for grizzlies.
Dear GoPro. A bear ate your product. It was under warranty ... can I have a replacement please ?  Haha
I thought that GoPro‘s were waterproof.
“Thanks for the free Go Pro. Dumb humans.”  -Bear.
I don’t know why. I don’t even pretend to understand. But in Pennsylvania our brown bears all prefer glazed donuts over everything else.
I'm quite sure I visited this facility.. it's been several years ago and it looks a much bigger operation now..
23 videos left :(
Its all right Tom, you got 124k views in 46 minutes. The Go Pro is paid for.
thanks Tom :)
Cheers for the continued email newsletters
I hope that bear didn't get to the battery... 😕
"The CPR Method" 😂
This was a very nice video
I can't help but imagine the bear heard Tom saying "Don't put the GoPro in the water" and just thought, "Oh, I'm gonna.  You made the mistake of giving it to me.".
So why don't we treat cows, pigs, chickens, and other animals with the same welfare standard we have for bears?
The acknowledgment by Tom at 3:27 was highly appreciated!
RIP go Pro
This was probably the most interesting video in a while, not that the others weren't.
My family camped in Yellowstone National Park over 50 years ago. I have family photos of bears going into tents and vehicles that were parked in campgrounds. Our family followed the rules and didn’t have any problems with bears. The people camping nearby had their camp destroyed by bears because they didn’t follow the rules. Really dumb humans.
talk too much.
That bear just yoinked your go-pro mate 😂 i bet he's been wanting to take some underwater shots hehe
one of my fave videos of yours probably ever hahahaha this is so great
5:20 he wonna be a youtobe star now cool video
this video has almost passed the bear test
Did the footage inside the bears mouth survive?
RIP GoPro. If you're ever recovered I'd love to see it on tomscottplus 😅
There's a drive through safari in Washington state where you can throw slices of bread to bears and they wave at you.
With the bear doong CPR on the trash can, i was waiting firbthe bear ro start smaking the kid (like slapping the head of a person), but i guess the bear is smarter then some people who work on medical dramas.
👍 Good one!
Best video yet
Why would anyone would want to go and setup camp site in a forest with giant grizzly bears in the first place????
This is one happy bear with a new toy.
some GoPros were harmed in the making of this video.
Tom repeating "That is a bear with a GoPro" in despair at the end is the best part of this video.
I think you really should have interviewed a bear, as it's them actually doing all the hard work! "I've been with the Grizzly & Wolf Discovery Center since 2018, and it's been a fulfilling job ever since. I once got pretty angry when I couldn't open the 19th container in a row - even the CPR method didn't work! But I managed to open the 20th container, got my 12 ounces of honey, so all's fine."
9 minutes to go.
Wow
So what you are saying is the trash containers need quality beariers…
I love this place
So to keep the bears away from containers ... we are training them to try their hardest to open each container they encounter and rewarding them with treats? Allrighty then.
It's a GonePro now :(
GoPro really need to step up its game, not even slightly bear resistant tsk tsk
Some tourists are reasonably intelligent but simply don't give a fnck
Video interaction
Thanks Tom for all the videos in the last year about Wyoming, Montana and Idaho. Ive been watching for years and its delightful to watch you share experiences from my home area. Cheers
Once saw a bear tear the lid off a "bear-proof" metal bin...yeh, they'll get into everything.
I remember a very similar challenge on one of the episodes of Fetch with Ruff Ruffman. The line about "Bear resistant, not bear proof" has always stuck with me.
Cool
This is why this channel rocks.  I go backpacking and climbing in this area a ton.  I always wondered how they tested these
Duuuuude!  I was there last month!  So close to accidentally getting to meet you :)
RIP GoPro
Note to self  Don't use a GoPro in the woods, maybe a Sony or Nikon would be less edible? 😊
I was just visiting Yellowstone last week!! Maybe I just missed you... Or maybe you recorded this months ago.. haha
I live in the great bear rainforest. Living in a remote community with bears around 8-10 months of the year. Grizzlies. A company offered us trash bins that could withstand bear attacks. Stronger than whats tested here. Did the bins last longer than an hour? Yes, 2-3hrs before the bears just tore it open from the side instead of getting the lid off.
"Bears are smart enough not to eat the camera. They will pick it up and try to shoot their own Tiktoks with it." -Tom Scott, probably
Up here in Toronto, no bears as such, but there has been a LONG battle between the city and the raccoons over our compost bins.
the gopro is not bear resistant
the bear wants to vlog!
Instead of euthanizing a bear with an interest in trashcans and coolers, they give it a job.   You know, euthanizing would be kinder.
How did you get the fotage of the gopro?
Your intro kind of sounds like the steps we would take to domesticate bears.. it worked with dogs.. why wouldn't it.. oh wait..
I am all for animal testing, if the animals test the things not when they are tested on! <3
About the brainpower overlap thing... It's already hard enough to convince many people to put their rubbish in a bin to start with, whereas the bear gets a food reward if they can break in. I think if you were to put a $1,000 reward inside a bin, there wouldn't be many tourists without the mental faculties to work out how to open it.
Win win-not only are you getting dangerous bears away from people, you are getting a supply of testing bears who are already good at wrecking trash cans.
Bears test whether containers can bear the brunt of their bear power
very cool. hope the bears remain alright.
i take it the majority of the GoPro footage was unrecoverable, or just didn't make the final cut?
Tom: Do not put the camera in the water! The bear: 🐻🤔 The camera: 🌊 glug
The bear looked positively excited to test the GoPro in the water. And maybe get some decent underwater footage to share with the others... :D
so what i'm getting from this is that we should train bears to be able to work in hospitals and emergency services performing CPR.
o7 gopro
Deja Vu. I really thought you had already made this video months/years ago. Really strange
Their smarter than the average bear
Tom talking to the bear.  Priceless.
Impossible to compete in todays work force when even bears have years of product testing experience.
Tom being surprised that they let him put a go-pro on the container and then watching why they were okay with it was the funniest thing I've seen today.
Sad how bears are so smart and cool yet could kill you with a wave of their paw
Ah so the brain of your average Republican is on par with the smartest bears.
Lmaooo the CPR method 😂
Hope that go-pro wasn't too expensive Tom!
Love the British response to a bear nicking the go pro.
The bear taking Tom's GoPro to the pond proves that anything that can go wrong...will go wrong
I hike quite often in black bear country. They're magnificent and beautiful creatures. Don't feed them, A fed bear is a dead bear.  They're also bloody nuisances. Bleack bears virtually never attack humans, (the boars will charge, but they're bluffing). Still, getting your gear shredded and your food eaten when you're 30+ km from support can be nearly as bad.   I carry a carbon fibre canister for food and rubbish. Once or twice, I've seen evidence that a critter has played with it, but the lore is that they do eventually learn that it's pointless to attack the carbon fibre ones.  There are several brands of commercial bear canister that are NOT approved where I hike, because there was a genius bear sow who figured out how to open that type. (Incidentally, a human needs a screwdriver to accomplish the task.)  Even though she was made into stew a few years back, she taught her cubs, and now there are bears all over the area that know how to open them.  I used to be able to get away with hanging a bag from a tree on a branch too small to support a bear's weight, and with nothing accessible at ground level, so that I'd need to use a trekking pole to fish the line down in the morning.  But the mama bears have learnt to send a cub up a tree to bite through the line and bring down the bear piñata.
Nice job, fellow bears ! 🐻😀
Gone pro
"Hey there Boo Boo, you seen any pic-a-nic baskets lately?" "Gee Yogi, I have but they're all really difficult to open these days" "Aww that's too bad Boo Boo. Hey hey hey, here comes Ranger Smith" "Oh no Yogi, I think Ranger Smith has it in for you after you savaged those tourists last week" "Don't be silly Boo Boo, after all, I'm smarter than the av-" BANG!
the"CPR" method is also used on prey including people.
for some reason I remember Tom covering this before? A little different, but still a video on bears testing things like this
Tom: the bear won't do anything to the camera The bear: *takes gopro* Tom: don't put it in the water, bear Bear: *puts gopro in water*
Tom Scott's unprovoked bear fucker attack 🤨
23 left
bears are clever, not only they know how to do CPR, but also know how to protect their privacy by destroy the GoPro using water.
I'm so happy Tom included a line about pic-a-nic baskets
This is the earliest I’ve ever been to a tom Scott video and I always know it’s going to be great
Tell you what’s nerve racking. There is a lake that I hike into every year and it’s in the heart of southwest Montana, also happens to be the area where nuisance Yellowstone bears get dropped off. I’m taking grizzly tanks and angry browns, hours away from any hospital or major town.
isn't this a re-upload?
Hahahaha.  "That's not ideal."
I would have assumed something like this existed but I wouldn't think they used actual bears. This is a really interesting example of using what you've got.
Hey!  No shouting to the bear with your GoPro 😂!
Pic-a-nic baskets
Fun Fact, A bears sense of smell is over 2000 times better than a humans. A dogs is between 20 to 300 times better depending on the breed.
Tom is just outside Yellowstone National Park (the Montana portion), where you can almost certainly get away with any crime due to the Zone of Death loophole he covered earlier on this channel.
why did it take the gopro though? as a toy?
Now you've given bears the taste of GoPro...
Is that Aqua's dad?
New TechDif format idea: throw the guys in one at a time and see who passes the Bear Test!
Bears are the best
Not even surprised that a bear is smarter about their privacy than humans are.
It always feels kind of weird to see a Tom Scott video about a place you've visited before
GoPro: will survive rocket launches and atmospheric reentry. But not bears.
Tom said "pic-a-nic basket" and thought noone would notice the sneaky reference
IM SORRY THIS IS ADORABLE
1:16 - I think you'll find it's pronunced "picker-nick basket"😁
I went to Yellowstone once, and can't wait to go again, and the sheer number of individuals who CAN'T FOLLOW THE RULES is exceptionally high. There are signs in many languages, there are tour guides, there are visual aids, and still, people think wild animals are there for their entertainment. Thankfully, while I was there, no one was killed by a buffalo (bison) or by walking into the hot springs or anything else super easy to avoid but it still happens... it's annoying, honestly, how "dumb" people are. Not in an intellectual disability way, just in an ignorant, selfish, and lazy way. I cleaned up my trash, I avoided interacting with wildlife, I kept my bug sprays to myself... :/ I love big animals and seeing their intelligence and how, if given time and space, they could match toddlers and children in terms of communication and problem-solving. I've seen some dumb humans (I've worked in customer service and human resources for going on a decade) and most can't problem-solve for the life of them. I know some SMART people with PhDs and tenure and books that can't convert PDFs, that can't figure out how to effectively google something, that can't retain information and that can't save things for later. I'm fairly average intelligence-wise, I have terrible short-term memory, especially post-COVID, but like... some stuff doesn't have to be obvious if it's stated multiple times and there are reminders everywhere. Especially if it's life or death.
Wait so did you get the GoPro back? Looks like there was some footage?
i thought the title was talking about a bear
Bear test??
Did u get your go pro back ?😂
"Thank you for calling FML Insurance, Mr Scott: so how was your GoPro damaged?  Again?"
I love the foreshadowing. Bears are smart, they won't be interested in my camera. Minutes later the bear steals it and dunks it in water.
I really want to know what happened to the gopro and how they got the footage
That guy is definitely Ron Swanson in a disguise.
Also i would like to add that people often don't want to touch trashcans with their hands because it would be unhygienic
I guess we could say, the trash can bear-ly survived being ripped apart...
I wouldn't mind seeing Tom's insurance claim form for his GoPro
I mean, having domesticated bears isn't necessarily a bad thing. After all, nobody today is complaining about all these domesticated wolves ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Very cool!
AHHHHUUUU WE ARE MAKING THE BEARS SMARTER
Ma gawd
Remember: 30 compressions, 2 breaths, repeat until peanut butter is achieved.
I loved the way Tom pronounced "Pic-e-nic" baskets. Ay Boo-Boo?
“that is a bear with a gopro” i’m dead
Read this as "Bechdel test" and I was really confused for a few seconds
Seems like the bear hates exposure to cameras and is smart enough to drown it, well done😂😂😂
Why are bears so friend shaped, but so deadly?
Wow each of these videos has always been so lovely but the fact that this production is coming to an end really has made every video an extra sweet treat.
What not even a _pick-a-nick_ ?
Interesting part of this interview is where he states that bears belong in the woods. Who decided that? Isnt it us as humans who push natural habitat of animals away? Its ego-centric and hypocritical say these things. There is no objective reason for humans to live in the natural habitat of bears. The fundamental thinking is just so selfish.
Looks like it's time to make a bear resistant Go Pro
I knew Tom wouldn't be able to resist a little Yogi easter egg 😂
Am I the only one who looked at the guy like hmmm he I the real ronswanson 😅
Having lived in Lake Tahoe for a year I can attest to the skills of bears to get into many things considered bear-proof. Mostly the problem was with tourists not knowing how to be extra careful about the bears, as long-term residents are well aware and also have great affection for the bears.
If they do this with one bear then they’re effectively training the bear. Is it fair to compare an elite bin destroying athlete with a bear that’s just smarter than average?
4:37 damn he really just said that
LET THE BEARS PAY THE BEAR TAX, I PAY THE HOMER TAX!
Why not friend if friend shaped?
So if you need a quality CPR in the wild, hide in a trash can and pour honey all over yourself.  It might have some side effects...
There is a video of a an electrified deer carcass that was hung up by some researchers. The bear hung around until he worked out a possible solution and knocked the car battery powering it away and got the deer.
What kind of madman goes camping in an area that they've been informed beforehand has bears? What, is going swimming in shark-infested waters not exciting enough?
They should make a bear resistant gopro
i can see now that badly stored food or food waste is the same as feeding them in terms of effect.
I wonder how many go pro's tom went through in this series
Many go-pros were harmed in the making of this film. Bears are completely fine, though.
1:17 - I enjoyed the Yogi Bear reference, but I really feel like you missed a good opportunity to slip "smarter than the average bear" in there somewhere.
Let the bears pay the bear tax, i pay the homer tax!
it's so cruel of nature to make some of the more dangerous wild animals also be some of the damn cutest
Why do none of the bears wear a hat or a necktie?
Omg i loved this
I want to see that footage from the GoPro.
Why is something so dangerous so cuddly looking
The bears are salivating and drooling on the dummy container as they try to open it. They know well what's inside.
So they're testing armoured pick-a-nic baskets to see if they can withstand the efforts of a bear that's s-mmarter than the average bear?
That's a bear with a gopro
Yellowstone has got to be one of the coolest places on earth.
Great video as always, Tom!
Last i checked bears don't give a dang about a line on a map, so most of the area around Yellowstone is also bear country.
Is it just me or are bears some of the most adorable creatures ever?
That GoPro never stood a chance.
I know that the channel is nearing its end, but etymology of the word "bear" would have been a great return to its linguistic origins.  (It's fascinating, for anyone who cares.)
When were you in Bozeman!?  Great vid!
"I didn't steal your gopro" said the bear faced liar.
Absolutely awesome video as always TOM!!!
pick a nick
22 videos to go :'(
PLEASE DO NOT SPEAK TO THE BEARS      they never shut up
Business bears are best bears
He said "That's a bear with a GoPro" in such a concerned voice that the tone would've been more appropriate for "That's a chimpanzee with an assault rifle"
Bears are just massive raccoons.
Hmmm I would have thought the best way would be rather than bear resistance packaging make packaging that doesn't allow smells to get out or make odourless food if such a thing is even possible.
maybe this is also what the aliens do with the abducted humans that get too close to their crop circles
Great Video
That bear is gonna have a lot of fun with that GoPro
This is like when the F.B.I. catches counterfeiters.
For bears its choice between life in prison and death sentence for no fault of their own, so sad
"There is significant overlap between the smartest bears and the stupidest tourists"
NOOOO! You can't stop there.. What happen to the GoPro? did it survive? Did you get it back? Could you salvage the video on it? SO MANY QUESTIONS!!!
If the bear takes your gopro, assume its his.
That quote about tourists is one of my favorites ever.
I'm surprised by the amount of products that are tested every year. Why do there need to be so many different bear-proof coolers, just invent a few designs that work and then everyone can use that design.
Love the video Tom!
lets see
A trick I recall seeing before, at least if you've brought canned food with you, is to leave the empty container upside-down in the fire.
I love how the ravens seem to know that hanging around the bears can get them a free meal. Imagine the combined problem-solving skills of a corvid and the raw physical power of a bear, they would make quite the team.
WhY aRe yOu hErE? YoUrE SuPpOsEd tO bE aSlEeP!!
Gotta ask, did you intentionally say 'pic-uh-nic' basket as a Yogi Bear reference? =P
I love how bears have to be fed by getting their food hidden in various places
Tom Scott is visiting our global populaion failsafe huh.    if you know scp, you know what I mean
Less humans is not a bad thing.
My dog does CPR to.
Go to the smoke jumper’s café in the west Yellowstone airport for some cheap quality foods in a town filled with tourist traps
Looks like the gopro wasn't bear resistent as well
"Ay Boo-Boo!"
That's certainly not ideal, those go pros are tough though!
i take it we cant see the gopro footage?
"That's a Bear with a GoPro"  PMSL Tom. love it.
1:17 imagine getting fired from your position as a bear and needing to get a new job as a container tester.
isn't there a way to re-educate the bears? Like putting food in the containers that smells good, but tastes bad? Or that makes them feel sick?
Awesome. That's one tasty GoPro!
If they have to put food in every twenty goes, to keep the bears interested, why not just, you know, NOT put the food in and let the bear go back into the wild when they’ve got bored with all these containers?   I’m being facetious, I know it’s more complicated than that (I live in Whistler, yesterday one - brown, not grizzly - was sat on my front drive when I set off for a hike)
So cool to see you in our neck of the woods!
Bears are so cool
We already have human usable and human resistant all metal mail boxes. Why is this not the standard?  Do bears carry oxy torches nowdays?
So Yogi Bear should have been euthanized instead of having a cartoon show. Gotcha.
I honestly wanna see such high quality footage of bears just being bears! The footage you got was very amusing!
Bear takes a go pro for a walk into the water.  Tom says "That's not ideal".   The most British thing I have heard you say.
It was reported later that the bear with the GoPro choked on the camera and died...............      KIDDING!!
GoPro? more like GoIntoTheWater
You said you couldn't find a source on the bear intelligence overlap. I can believe it though, even your video proved it if someone put trash in one of the handles.
I wonder if Astarion passed the bear test...
This is fantastic, just last week I was wondering about how stuff is tested as bear proof, and had found about this testing. And now here's a video!
the biggest problem is, as always, stupid people
True bear-proof enclosures can be made, as seen in "The Polar Bear Family & Me" however it would be unpractical and overengineered for most applications such as camping.
The fact that the flight attendant had to tell everyone to not feed the bears is objectively so funny to me
Pouring one out for the GoPro.
In my hometown, the cops go to bear calls with a beanbag shotgun to simply cause the bear to go "That's pain. Pain is bad. Not worth the reward."
Go Pro abuse.
If course they said yes to the go pro, it wasn't theirs so f it 😅
I wonder if the bear enjoyed the GoPro battery.
"That's... Not ideal..." One of the most British statements there are...
Rip to your gopro
Bear tested your gopro 😆
Rip GoPro 🤣
Not so much a Go-Pro as a Gone-Pro...
F in chat for the GoPro
Bear showing up on day one (April 1) and being greeted with a locked box with food in it:  "Is this some kind of joke?"
A bear with a GoPro
So, are these bears technically scientists doing research?
I dont understand, why the bears are in jail ? Why not free them ?
40 minutes to go
That boy was salivating straight up string cheese.
Tom, did the GoPro survive the bear resistance test? 😅
"Not ideal." - English understatement! ;)
"Bear with a GoPro" was not among the things I'd expect to see in a Tom Scott Video
5:17 That's the bear's Go Pro now
Bears are smart and strong. If the old noggin' isn't joggin', they'll CPR that container to death and have the goodies in no time. 🐻
Bear taking up vlogging in the end? Bear Scott
Can we get a follow up on how the go-pro did on the bear-resistant exam?
Well, you *are* leaving YouTube, so....
Rip toms go pro
I would have thought Tom was clever enough to put some extra protective case.
I assume that GoPro was inside the bin, since we only got footage from the outside. Unless it was streaming that whole time to another device.
Bears are like fantasy rpg monsters, except they’re real and they’re just walking around the woods
Oh no. It's a Go Pond now
I live in a place where bears often spend time in town in autumn.  I have big plastic box that contains the garbage cans, I'm sure it's not super extra bear resistant, but it's a harder target than other stuff around here, so it's good enough.
Bears Are such gorgeous creatures
That quote by the park ranger is so savage, yet so true  “There is a considerable overlap between the brainpower of the most intelligent bears and the least intelligent tourists”
RIP GoPro
that’s a lot of things that the tourists have to bear in mind
Here at 39,298 views.
Thank you for sharing this! Bears are usually quite docile animals in spite of their bad rep. By developing new ways to safely store food, we can minimize risks and enjoy the beauty of the wilderness responsibly. Stay bear aware!
try a ATM machine, i wonder how long it would take for them to open it
Bear-resistance is a trait I never knew before.
Don´t blame the Bear for the loss of a GoPro. The last time he saw one it was attached to a nice meal.
Well, RIP Tom’s Go Pro, but the video was definitely worth it
4:30 i always thought this was a joke but there it is...
I'll never understand how bears can be simultaneously so adorable and so terrifying
Those garbage cans have bear-ly survived the bear's cpr attack, ain't I right folks, also rest in peace GoPro, you've GOne a really PROfessional job. 🙏
Bears, there is fish on Mars!  They'll probably figure it out before we do...
Anyone who lived this should play honey heist!
To quote the Yellowstone National Park Team, when asked why it was hard to design a bear proof bin: “There is considerable overlap between the smartest bears and the dumbest users”
Jamie pull up the footage of the bear attacking the trash can
If so dangerous, why fren shaped?
The bear:Stay alive Trash Can,please!
how did bro get the gopro footage if the bear got the gopro
i loved the bear at the end 10/10 bear
🐻🗑
That poor gopro just couldn't bear it.
Thank god bears can do CPR on each other 🥺
Sure the bear wasn’t interested in the go pro 😅
"That's.... not ideal..!"🤣🤣
I understand that it's an ethical issue to use bears for entertainment, but...  the CPR method?? It's unethical to NOT be entertained by that.
Put the bin at the end of a deep shaft and remove it by using a rope. Bears don't have ropes. Yet.
I wish the whole video of the go pro is uploaded, I would like to see it very much
Forget MrBeast putting Lamborginis through hydrualic presses, lets see one in the Bear Encolsure!
Did you file a warranty claim on the GoPro?  "Defective in the box"?
Pic-a-nic bas-ket /i see what you did there
They don't survive because they've been 𝙖𝙧𝙘𝙝𝙞𝙩𝙚𝙘𝙩𝙚𝙙
Did he say pickinick basket?
"Dear Insurance. My GoPro was stolen and the thief threw it into the waters." - Tom probably.
Yogi: Ya hear that, Boo Boo? Mr Tommy Scott is profiling my scavenging for pic-a-nic baskets!😁 Boo Boo: Mr Scott might have a point, Yogi😐
F in chat for the GoPro.
one of the coolest videos on your channel imo! or maybe i just really like bears
3:00 - CHEST COMPRESSIONS, CHEST COMPRESSIONS, CHEST COMPRESSIONS!  Dr mike gonna go wild for this 😁
BEAR WITH A GO PRO WHAT'S HE GONNA RECORD
Hey Tom do you often get recognized by fans when recording at places like this?
cruelty free animal testing at its finest.
Same story every time, dumb humans ruining it for the rest of us -.-
We had to make trash bins crow proof at a university. Guess what... 🤣
I WANT THE GOPRO FOOTAGE :D
A friend fancies bears, don't think he means Ursus though. 😃
This is the test you have to go through to get Russian citizenship
"chest compressions. chest compressions. chest compressions" apparently also the bear mantra to getting food out of a trash can 🤣🤣🤣 Also, RIP Tom's Gopro. It was worth it though. Loved the close up footage of the live teddy bears.
go pro bear⁉️😯
i want them to put a normal hatchback in there. bear vs smart car
I think besides maybe a hippo, bears are the cutest yet deadliest animal. I'm in Australia, so we don't have bears but we do have dingos and man, I just wanna pet em so bad but I know you can't.   Anyway great vid
Yep! That's a bear with a GoPro
Today we've found out that GoPros are not bear resistant!
If the bear is smart he will let the can pass the test so the bears in the wild can get in to it
Ohh, poor gopro. I wish this was some live-transmitting camera instead, though admittedly, not sure it would capture a lot due to the drool. There was a lot of drool.
Well that bear with the GoPro was just about to start his own youtube channel about him breaking into stuff
I like how the bear with the GoPro at the end looks less like they're trying to eat it, and more like they've just taken up vlogging.
Please do more bear content, this is awesome!
Guess, the GoPro isn't bear resistant then? Or could it just not bear it anymore? Enough of the bear puns, but bear with me: The bear didn't go all too bearserk, from what I saw.   I'll see myself out. Great video, Tom!
RIP: GoPro.
Hmm how did he get the Go Pro footage?
Such a shame that go pro footage wasn't recovered
Soon as Tom said he got to put the Go Pro in with the bears, I knew it a dead camera 😬
3:15 You can see the pavlovian saliva response, thats adorable ... as a dorable as a 300kg killing machine can be. Sort of like my dog (who is a very good boy) except a lot more threatening.
You could say this is a necessity.
I know this video is about bears, but I say we should give those ravens some appreciation too  Edit: Seems like the consensus in the replies is that they are ravens, not crows!
I remember that we got a dog toy that said tiger tested, the dog shredded it in a month. Must not have been tiger approved.
bears are somehow the most cute and the most deadly creatures
RIP go pro
Excellent as usual! Good stuff Tom!
Let us not forget the sacrifice of Doug, the brave GoPro who gave his life for this video.
I have never met a bear personally but I deal with dumb tourists for a living and I can confirm the overlap.
Shame about the lost GoPro.
w
RIP gopro
Tom "that's...not ideal" Scott
I guess you couldn't retrieve the go pro, or go pro footage anymore?
the way i cackled at the bear playing with the gopro lmao, genuinely one of the funniest things i've seen in ages. also i love that the bears have a job now
Seeing as these bears are cpr certified I'd assume they are smarter than a decent amount of humans
we'll miss you on your break :(
I love all the corvids hanging around waiting to see if the bears are gonna get in.
Tom is un tannable
It was mandatory to say " picnic baskets "
I could not work here. Id wanna cuddle them
Nice! Bear with a gopro  (Well, not exactly nice, but a bit funny)
That is... not ideal. Hehe
RIP GoPro
I wonder how long Tom had to wait to get his gopro back. I guess they go into the bear enclosure only once per day, or maybe in the morning and evening?
CPR-method... so, can we hire bears as emergency medical staff? 🙂
Yogi Bear would love this place.
Can we still feed Yogi and Boo-Boo from our pic-a-nic baskets??
RIP go pro. You served well
Nice video 👍
black bears tear my garbage lid open damn near every night, they completely ignore the lock and just bend the lid while scooping everything that they can out, we dont even put food in our garbage its so weird and so annoying. Makes me sad every time I think about them because they're risking their lives coming to our garbages
That trash can couldn't bear to survive for an hour
RIP to the GoPro 🫡 your services won’t be forgotten
it's interesting to see how places deal with bears in their trash. we have bears here but they usually stick to forests
A great tragedy that the go pro was not filming anymore in the bears mouth.
Bear!
That's a blogger bear
amazing video
ROAR!!!
If I'm not supposed to approach the bears, why do they look so pettable?
That gopro met a fitting end. o7
well that is in fact a bear with a gopro
Give mammals a way to get what they need to survive without working for it, they will take it.  The will feel entitled to it.  And they will get angry if they can’t have it.  They will kill to get it.
"I got Tom Scott's GoPro! I love that guy"
F to Tom's Gopro
That bear has a shiny new toy.
Once I heard him say the go pro should be fine with the trash can, I knew it was a goner
Outstanding pronunciation of picnic basket on a video about bears.
The bear is not going to mess with the GoP- GOOD HEAVENS
RIP to the GoPro
well humans are trained on the idea that if something doesn't open easily it's probably locked and you're not allowed to open it
Can we just appreciate how many bears he puts into his videos? 😃
Rest in peace go pro.
Can we just appreciate how many bears he puts into his videos? 😃
How did you get the GoPro footage if it fell in the water?
That line about intelligence overlap is a classic and I would've been quite disappointed had you overlooked the opportunity to include it here
Can we just appreciate how many bears he puts into his videos? 😃
How kind of the bear to wash your GoPro adter drooling on it :)
Imagine someone is inside the trash can
1:34 Ah, see here's your mistake. 40 isn't enough in some situations. You're gonna need 30-50 feral coolers...
Great video. I haven't been up that way in years. Makes me want to go
The CPR method lmao  These bears are insanely smart when it comes to food
So if a bear cannot open it it is... unbearable  🤣
Watching a bear give CPR to a trash can was surprisingly delightful.  Also, RIP Tom’s GoPro. (EDIT: Turns out it lived after all! See Tom’s follow up video.)
It's nice from the bear that he tries to revive the dead trashcan before he rips it apart.
pickernick basket
Maybe they should've tested the Titanic sub here...
Bear-resistant? They should add the label "tourist-proof".
I can't believe they made this entire wildlife center in celebration of the latest baldurs gate 3 panel. Amazing.
1:01 deeply uncanny to hear "trash cans" said with a British accent.
Gummy Bear likes GoPro 📷
the bear what
This is an ongoing battle. I live in an area bears frequent and the ways they’ve gotten into the garbage stuns me. I currently use an electric fence generator attached to chicken wire wrapped over the top of my bin. Seems to be working so far…
Hello
Gratz on 6m subscribers Tom!
I must not have had my morning coffee.  I was wondering, "If this video survives an hour, it passes the... the BEAR test?  What?  Is it... going to be remov-what?"
Thats one hell of a topic you got there
I could take a group of bears
Well, lesson learnt.. Never feed the bears in bear county..
they gave yogi bear a job
hi
The real problem is that "the smartest bear" and "the dumbest human" have considerable overlap 😂
E
nice
I always heard the park struggled with making a bin easy enough for the dumbest humans to open, but hard enough for the smartest bear to not be able to. There was apparently quite a large overlap
Still here
If not friend why friend shaped?
Bear ❤
The 'CPR Method' is the cutest thing I've seen this week!
MA.
23 left.
Is this where they test all that really annoying plastic packaging nobody knows how to open?
Ok
Human safety is so overrated
Oh no, the GoPro
bar teas
I need a maroon  T-shirt !
<3 going to miss these vids next year
My HOME TOWN!!!  Don't forget about the Moose
As an American I assumed  "don't feed the bears" is where the "don't feed the trolls" phase comes from. It's a phrase we use in casual conversation along with "don't poke the bear" although that's singular now that I think about it. 🤔
Anyone know how to make a killer grilled cheese?
Love the picnic baskets joke
Haha I gave National Park Ranger talks at the Grizzly and Wolf Discovery Center there over 10 years ago! Loved that place! We had a partnership with them where we could give Park talks there.
Americans: Aah, it's a bear *runs away* Russians: Hold my vodka *rips shirt*
oh the power of opposable thumbs
so far this is very interesting
There's a considerable overlap between the intellect of the most intelligent bears and the least intelligent tourists, as evidenced by the Yogi Bear documentary.
Hey, the thumbnail spoils the title. 😄
These trash cans are more secure than my house
I hope he didn' tell a bear faced lie!
1 minute and 500 views, nice!
The Bear Test: The Most Fierce Test Of Them All
How does this video have 3 views and 116 likes in a minute? 😂  The GoPro going into the water was a funny ending
That's a problem I'd never have considered without this video.
Cool 🎉
Hi Tom!
😮😮
Balloon
W new tom scott video
20 percent of americans: I can survive the bear test
I hope these bears are paid well
Nice video
