MILKA BTS ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂❤😇😇😇🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤣🤣🤣🤣

정한   근사하다  (🤦🏻‍♀️‪՞ .  ̫ .՞)
I found Jun’s part is very cute🥺
하니햐..

첫 번째에 조슈아 왤케 잘 생겼냐???????
JEONGHAN UR'E SO HANDSOME
하…씨..정한 진짜 왜 이렇게 노래 잘하고 잘생기고 사랑스럽고 귀엽고 춤잘 추고 ….너무 완벽 하잖어!!
❤
น่าร้ากกกกกกก😍😻🫶🏻
This boys are very good❤
Hey ❤
나 sm 이 노래 너무 좋아 매일 이 노래 들어요 🥲🥲
Kahilo naman camera man
Jeonghan voice is so cute❤
이게 1년전 노래였나?엄청오래됬네아낀다가 5일 전 노래였던 것 같은데 시간이 빨라
S.coups😢
SEVENTEEN FOREVER
happiness doesn't come from grades,it come from SEVENTEEN
This comeback was with such a bright and cheerful concept...All their outfits..Woozi's mullet and high notes, Jeonghan's short hair everyone are soo handsome. I feel proud watching SEVNTEEN nail any concept.   All I am waiting for is a horror or mysterious concept from SEVENTEEN..SeokGyu's roles in it, Woozi's phenomenal production and their choreo
2:03 우리 보보 고음 찢었다
This needs to be on billboard 😢
Anyone else just levitate like an angel at Woozi’s high note?
Who came after Jungkook live. ( Any ARMY 💜 ) Here
OMG 😳 but I like bts
Anyone in 2024?
ALL I  CAN HEAR IS TROT MUSIC
내가 안아주고싶다 얘
amo como le quedan los jeans acampanados a wonwoo
I'll stay loyal to THE8 even though dont like his hairstyle here

By the way what does mean 'kung chi pachi'
Vernon and jun are my bias
Where's mingyu?
No Mingyu?
Wait wait is one member missing or it was a "we are live" (which backfired bc theres clearly a backtrack) moment??

Şu şarkını asla ciddiye alamıyorum going seventeen izlediyimden beri😂
AMOOOO ✨🫶🏻
jun looks sooo cute
A vibeee❤
I’m still learning all their names but these boys are so freaking talented. They’re one of the few groups who actually seem to still be enjoying themselves
Will forever be their fan👊
Jeonghan on the thumbnail is very effective 😌
I guess this song hits different, knowing that they just had a beautiful mini vacation on Nana Tour then had to learn this whole dance in a few days for the MV. So knowing that they got a bit of rest and getaway to reenergized makes me happy to see them smiling.
Please help, who is at 3:40 with the red collar?? edit: i learned it is DK :)

The tempo of the fanchant at the end (calling members name) does not match the guide but you did well carats 😂👏🏻👏🏻
SEVENTEEN !!
Gays
썸네일이 정한이인데 안들어올수 있냐거❤❤ 진짜 음악의 신 미모의 신 셉틴🫶🏻 이번에도 대박나자ㅏㅏ~~

Everyone is glowing esp.Charles <3
Scoups weeeereee aaaarrree yoooouuu ????????🤔😫😫😫
I love this comeback so much ❤...but where is Scoups and Mingyu? 😔
みんなが楽しみながら歌ったり踊ってリしてて、こっちまで楽しさが伝わってくる笑
i cant help but notice the fake musicians at the back 😂😂😂
why the fanchat is kinda offbeat?
This is so attractive❤
세상에 음악의 신이 있따면~
Seventeen and their perfect stage performance 😭🫶
밍구랑 쿱뜨 두명만 빠졌어두 비어보이네..😢 얼른 회복해서 무대하자

The fake band in the background is so stupid lmfaojsjsj who approved this
Joshua，wonwoo，dk is so cute❤
Current bias (Dino) singing his part. Then comes the first bias in scene (The8) 😊😊😊
I found it cute that they have rookie vibes hehehe
FML is now the number one selling album in South Korean history and the first to break the 6 million mark and yet they still aren't slowing down and still deliver these god tier performances again and again.
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH SEVENTEEN!!!!!!
1:28 such a cute dance move 😭 the whole choreography is so cute
miss MINGYU
I'm not carat but i love svt songs so much and omg vernon got some moves woah he's so good!

Even after eight years, Seventeen never fail to deliver songs with so much passion and joy!
Me encantó la presentación y el baile están genial
Rest well scoups and mingyuuuu
We're still missing face cams for THE8 and DINO. Please be more respectful of SEVENTEEN members that have worked so hard this comeback. All our members are precious to us and it's very unprofessional and disappointing for a music show to exclude some of our members
King’s music
their energy is unreal
they were always so good
Unbelievably Outrageous!  'God Of Music' Is An Awesome Hot Hit!  Wooooooow!  😘❤️👍
Jeonghan us the thumbnail ❤

No one brings freshness and happiness to this world like Seventeen. I'm having the worst week and today it completes 1 week since my best friend, my doggo, passed away. And after griving and missing him a lot, getting sick myself and not having the best time, I can say that today I'm feeling happy as long as I'm listening to this song. Thank you, Seventeen. You brighten up my life.
❤❤❤
What a vibes
Vernon's swag is unmatched
We miss youuu my mingyu and cheolieee 🥺 please get well u both 🫶🏻🙏🏻
IM SO PROUD OF SEVENTEEN 😭💗💗
They're the best k-pop group to ever exist in k-pop 🩵🩷 we stan seventeen for a reason ❤
Jamming with Seventeen
What I like about svt is they keep proving that a good performance doesn't always mean powerful or aggressive concepts (which they also do so well), even lighter and more "cutesy" concepts can be amazing stages by svt standards!
THEIR VOCALS !! THEIR VISUALS ❤❤❤
The live vocals
their energy is impeccable!! and get well soon to my bae mingyu <333
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Jun part so cute
Comeback to see woozi highnote
They're already a 8 years boy group and been dancing for 10 years and yet they give it all out when performing...The energy and enthusiasm level are still high, I always respect idols who still very passionate in performing despite the years in the industry, as expected of Seventeen very talented yet humble men... Scoups and Mingyu get well soon....
my homeeee
My safe zone.
Who loves  svt with all their hearts ??
I'm so in love with Seventeen. They are the only idols that enjoy doing their job as an idol. It's been almost 10 years since they have become an idol but...Wow, the energy, passion, their performance are just amazing. This comeback, I love it so much. Seventeen let's go. Carat let's go
Others: 'kung chi pak chi kung kung chi pak chi  yeah'🎶 Carats😶‍🌫: 'My elementary friend’s name is Park Jiye'... 'When I get mad, I smash my face on the wall yeah' 🤡💎
The positive energy ❤
Shua intro ❤
LINDOSS
Grrrrr kack kack hitman bang

They way they pull every concept and still look good and great. They still look like they are rookie. The energy, the stage presence. Every time they comeback look like theg are new idol
The set?The vocals? This is year end stage worthy performance!
AY SEVENTEEN!!🩷🩵
just like what they (hoshi woozi specifically) said in their comenback talk show, this choreography is somehow harder than Super because they have to constantly keep up with the high energy of the song itself. but still throughout the performance we can see the joy in their expressions and moves and the overall vibe is so fun and energetic. seventeen did an amazing stage as always *baksu*
GEMES BGTTTTTT😭❤
i don't know but there is something about Jeonghan's Look here.. Is he getting more handsome?! Im so captivated ❤❤❤
Kung chi pak chi stuck in my head for days now 😂

This was TRULY a super year this year for SVT ( Seventeen ), some three months later, SUPER is still on everyone's rotation and this song God of Music is more than likely to give the group, well, 17+ heavenly reasons why Seventeen still has the energy and the stage presence to win the ❤of listeners around the world....❤ their recent performance from France video by the way!
The vibe is so amaaaazzzinggg that I smiled all throughout while watching them ❤️❤️❤️❤️

Jeonghan thumbnail
I’m probably really biased here, but I absolutely love it when Joshua starts the song. Also, nobody does fresh teen like svt?!
SEVENTEEEEEEEEEN TO THEEE WORLD
happy feel whenever I hear this song 😊
The choreo felt like they're doing a work out/an exercise, it must be tough, but they nailed it
my vocal unit looking like fairies 😍, especially jeonghan (he always looks extremely good), seungkwan (my tangerine) and woozi ❤.

Where’s mingyu?
Just in case anyone’s wondering why Mingyu not here, it’s because he suffered from a sudden lower back pain. He needed time for recovery and will be taking a week off starting from 26 Oct. It’s sad not having him and scoups in the comeback stage. 😭Hope that they get well soon !! ❤️❤️

Seventeen LET'S GOOO🩵🩷🩵🩷
For some people who are asking where is Mingyu:  -Last October 26, Pledis Entertainment said that he had a sudden, crippling lower back pain. So he's currently resting and won't do any Seventeen promotions/activities (for a week/a while). Upon being examined, he was advised by the medical staff to take his time off and have his recovery process monitored.   -Health always comes first and get well soon Mingyu and S.Coups!!🤍

Played the music video for my preschool students, they went crazy.😅 The music, the colours and the animals in the music video is freaking amazing. By the time they left most of them was sing the chorus. It's so addictive.  ❤️ Trinidad 🇹🇹 P.s . My new ear worm.
Mingyu and S. COUPS abscence never felt because of the other members doing their part REALLY THE BEST. GOOD JIB MY SEVENTEEM😍🌈🐜
Ya Allah sedih ga full member, sehat2 ya mingyu n scoups
KEREN! YOKSIIIII SEVENTEEN~~~~~

Seventeen OMG 💕💕
I don't know if it's just me but I see spots that I guess Scoups is positioned but they still left it open in the choreo. So even though he's not performing with them now, no one can fill that except for him. 🤭🥰💜
