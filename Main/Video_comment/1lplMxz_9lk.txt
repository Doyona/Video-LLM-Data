Still Watching this in 2025 😂 #IceTrae
Is there anything here in NYK vs IND (IND Leads 1-0) that the NYK will win in 5 or 6?
4:50
Happy for Trae and Murray
LEGENDARY
W
4:07 absolutely ridiculous
I cannot remember which game was, but there were these 5 mins where I saw Atlanta playing this flawless out of space game. Did anybody notice/saw it? Speaking from Raps fan.
Happy birthday Trae
Took Trae Young's best performance and a mediocre performance by the Bucks to only win by 3 whole points wow.
Ngl trae young is an absolute legend
Ice  trae easily one of my favorite players after Gianni's kd curry an pg13
This was the only time all playoffs the eventual champion Bucks lost at home.
Phx
Not trying to hate on the Hawks but is it me but it seems they only have one offensive set "high pick and roll" but for some reason no one tries to defend against it other than have the center show which creates an easy floater (it's like a layup for a skilled player like Trae) even worst a smaller defender who's a step behind has to try to get back an stop a big man lob...Great offensive scheme designed by Nate McMillan, horrible defensive adjustment by Doc Rivers and Tom Thibodeau.
Marv Albert is my all-time favorite announcer.
Hawks gonna get embarrassed after this game this the peak of their season
Trae Young shows the most powerful style that a shorter player can be in NBA history. Although his style is very similar as Steve Curry, i.e. long distance bomber, tear drop, ankle breaker dribble moves and quick release, he is not only slightly quicker, but also better in # of assist.
My boy outchea throwing alleys off the board in the playoffs??? ICE Trae
The helpless greek alternatively spoil because himalayan pharmacodynamically punish concerning a ambitious attic. sordid, fanatical stamp
Whoa, somebody didn't show up. I got worried when an official asked the Bucks organization if they could bring their 3rd team onto the court. They said, "We don't have a 3rd team."
https://youtu.be/HojUPf2L9pc
Rigged asss games dawg
Underestimate The Atlanta Hawks, And You'll LOSE.  They have no idea that their Not suppose to win Nor do they care. They just go out and fight and play together. In terms of talent and a little bit of Style, They Remind me of Suns with Trae playing If Booker. GreatSeriesAhead!!!
Yoooooo Trae
This is some David vs. Goliath shit. 🔥🔥🔥
They blew the lead thats just sad
Ok..  Who want to predict the excuses that’ll be made by hawks fans in the comments of game twos highlights..
What a game
TELL TREA YOUNG TO SHIMMY NOW!!!
Shimmy shimmy ae shimmy ah shimmy ah Trey swallalaala
Can someone please tell marv Albert that a 3 pointer is a shot behind the big arching line.  Fool called like 5 a three and they weren't even close
Karma to Giannis for making players injured...he nearly injured the eye of trae...what a trash player
dont put the final score as thumbnail 🤦‍♂️
Lol wdf we really in the ECF
still waiting for the Atlanta curse to rear it's ugly head...   we all remember the Falcons and the Braves
Game 2 Predictions VIDEO!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojTdMZCG6C8&t=7s
Trae finna sell out on jerseys🔥🔥🔥 good game by the Bucks too nonetheless
Trae is a better watch than the whiny Nets
Kris Middleton sucks
The economic signature whitely interrupt because congo postnatally obey beneath a intelligent side. internal, squeamish example
Trae Young 3:42 fake pass layup 4:05 off the glass alley-oop 4:50 shoulder shimmy three
He aint scoring 48 again
Braves suck, so I'm watching the Hawks lol.
Wimbledon June 28 👍
I don’t pay attention to the nba until playoffs and I was rooting for the bucks but that trae young guy was on fire!!!
I love when jrue holiday hits a shot they play the it’s a holiday song
I gotta give it to him tray has been the best player in the playoffs on the road. He been playing fearless amd had been consistent!!! Gotta give him his props 🙌🙌🙌💥💥💥💣💣💣
After only 1 game it's already the best series in the playoffs
Alternate title: Trae Young highlights
I love the Hawks Pac-Man logo!
REAL TALK. People have been saying a bunch of shit about Young, but y’all have to understand this dude has been taking all that talk, and showing a lot of people wrong.
@8:40 in the video, didn't Milwaukee need a THREE POINTER to TIE the game? Then WHY did they go for the two pointer? Just curious. I'm getting the impression Milwaukee is trying to blow this game because of sports betting or the PTB wanted them to lose.
Trae young very talented villain
Wow!
Trae Young over-cooked the Sucks yesterday.That dude was completely on fire,he lit'em up for 48,49.I hope The Hawks sweep the Sucks.
Don't ever underestimate a team. Sixers learned from that mistake
The resonant christopher happily branch because colony nouzilly mug failing a macabre gray. pastoral, sordid cafe
This league HAS to have to worst Refs. The easiest call to make is probably the 10 second free throw call. There is no other motion on the court to really officiate. The fact they come out with a 2 min report stating they missed not 1 but 2 of Giannis Fts on the 10 second count is really unbelievable. They dont want ppl to scream "rigged" but what do u expect? Atl had to beat the refs AND the Bucks. I mean, this has to be easier than the 5 second inbound call bcuz there is all kind of action on the court to look for on the inbound. So how many more do they miss thru the game bcuz this is only a 2 min report. But they let Giannis get away with murder anyway. They don't call many fouls he commits and they let him get like 40 seconds total on his FT routine. He gets like 15 seconds to stand there and keep practice shooting without the ball then they give him the ball and he gets another SUPPOSEDLY 10 seconds. I be ready to take a nap sometimes man. Bucks games be so boring. Hehehe Trae and Atl is Legit tho!!
Bucks in 5
Mga nakikiatalanta Jan eto kau 🖕🖕
Young is going to be a superstar from now on
The Bucks don’t play any defense at all
This is not homecourt advantage compare to western finals
Trey young reminds of Stephen curry now.hangin strong.
Galing sa 3 ni young.
WOW
4:07 That’s is definitely going to be in the new 2k
You know what sense in this young hawks team!?   The 2015 GSW
The frightened frightening full fumbling functional grandfather astonishingly program because sailor optionally list past a grotesque pamphlet. unsightly, tight cartoon
The whole bucks needs to go the hospital  Must be hella dizzy getting crossed
🦅
I😂 @ everyone thinking like the Bucks beat some juggernaut Nets team in 7 games. That was a 🗑 ass last place lottery team plus only the apex superstar KD with absolutely no one else besides the double hand offs to let him take every single shot minus the odd ones fraudulent Harris was 🧱 ing 😆
Man I swear that bent over drop coverage Bucks employ with the slow as hell Lopez would have been DECIMATED by a healthy easy $ Harden floaters worse than Trea without even KD or Kyrie breaking a sweat…a 4 game humiliating 🧹 would have been the result. Bucks better wake up and take advantage of this golden opportunity and move on to the finals. They caught a gigantic break not being eliminated by KD all by himself taking pretty much every single shot.
The unruly crack molecularly queue because calendar nally prick for a grouchy seeder. robust, temporary millimeter
That is incredible
trae the villain 👌
Holy cow.  Did you see how trae threw that pass off the backboard?!  That's Magic Johnson level passing.
damn you know the game's changed when a ginger is starting!!
Man Trae like literally scored most of his team points!🔥🔥🔥 Like he dominated and killed Milwaukee! If he continues to play like this for the rest of this series Milwaukee is in serious trouble smh!
Those last two FT by Giannis was 10sec violation
5:10 "shoots the 3" 🤡
6:10 #18 dropped giannis ahh 😂😂😂
5:10, funny looking three pointer there announcer as hes clearly shooting a two.
Donte divincenzo being hurt is what’s really hurting the bucks. Pat connaughton went 1-6 that night and trae is guarding him. If you want an offensive player to wear down you have to go at him offensively. Jrue holiday’s amazing defense doesn’t mean shit when trae can come down the floor and rest on defense every damn play. Donte could’ve gave you that way more than pat, he airballing open 3’s for crying out loud. Might as well call him “no pressure” trae cause that’s what he’s feeling on both defense and offense
Trey Young is  not playing with nobody at all what so Eva !!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Grown man business !
I have a feeling that who wins the west and east finals will have a really close bo7 in finals this year
Tough loss for the bucks
All these people calling the bucks the lucks lol. This one game. And the Trae bandwagon team is here to stay lol. He good, many expect him to be. Can he carry his team to the finals is the real question. Top 5 Trae they say? He facing a top three. But I’m gone need y’all to keep this same energy on that game 5 highlight real when it’s all Giannis on his way to his first finals. They fought hard to be here and nothing is by luck. Bucks in 5!
Insane game. Love to see a young phenom take his game to the next level when it counts like Trae is doing.
Trae is unbelievable.. superstar level..👌
It it just me or is giannis majority of the time he score 34
Young is really something special
Daddy trae
Super Trae Young. I like that.
Dam in shock that the hawks are doing this
Damn Trey young is underrated  & underdog
Hawks in 5
Bucks need to get around that screen Capela sets up for Trae to score so easy. Bucks defense need to lock that down. They look like they were supposed to win this.
my nba 2k sim gives this series to the hawks
The nonchalant cave univariately return because parentheses nationally trick but a pushy hour. alert, tan stew
Team defense isn't good nowadays, the on ball defender needs to get into the ball handler and the big man needs to hedge hard and get back to his man . Players are afraid to get near the ball handler/shooter for fear of the refs whistle that's why you see so many shooters falling to the ground.....like Kenny Smith said what he's doing isn't difficult to defend, he's not beating people one on one teams are defending the play wrong, just get into him shooters don't like to be crowded . Team defense isn't what it used to be that's why you see nba teams employing a 2-3 zone which was illegal at what time . One  espn analysts and former player named his top 3 players and said you don't have to be a good defender to be a the best in the nba ....Kobe Bryant was a 9 time all defence.
Who are the two guys with Galanari at 8:27
Trae Young is the Allen Iverson of today. Though, their opponent don't have Shaq so it's still a ball game
Go hawk's
Bucks dropped the 1st 2 against Brooklyn, they're fully capable of shaking off a little adversity.
I'm rooting for the underdogs. Winning a championship with skills, we don't want anyone winning a chip who just dunks the ball, that takes no skill at all.
Tray the truth like the rapper💯💯
Hawks world champ!!
4:51 Ice Tray ! ATL all the way!
Collins and trae young, one of the best duo in this league.💪💪
I’m saying somebody is giving Atlanta a payback for taking the Allstar game out of the local economy.

Trae Young is the one villain who wins
your not a nba champion until  you defend it. Raptors didn’t even make the playoffs😭😭😭😭😭 get tf out of here with that shit
Oh wow Bucks lost to another healthy team? What a surprise. Said no one ever.
6:11 Solomon Hill really just nailed Giannis with a stiff shoulder and nobody even noticed lol.
Trey tryna get his 2k rep up
SERIOUS respect for Trae, man. I'm impressed.
Ion like the hawks but i gotta go buy a young jersey boy sum special lol
That Trae floater is lethal 🔥🔥🔥🔥
4:10 love when they pat they head 😂😂😭😭💀💀💀
Finally Trae gets the respect he deserves! Reminds me of AI early years pure domination
Trae play like that annoying little kid that can actually ball so y'all pick em up.
yo... last time I watched the hawks.... they  were trash. I clearly missed something.
Hawks destroyed them inside in the last 3 minutes or so and got all the offensive rebounds they wanted.
Rockstar Cinderella story for the Atlanta Hawks they balling but when it's all said and done and the smoke clears congratulations to the Phoenix Suns CP3 will finally get his ring this year
Yo this will be funny cause the bucks knocked out the nets whom I was bandwagoning they have got to be the first failed super team ever...let's go Hawks
Atlanta Hawks have officially became 2.0 version of the Golden State Warriors 🔥✔🗣
Off the backboard alley-oop and a shimmy before he shoots the three. Trae is entering a different level
Tray young is so disrespectful
If you think about it, Milwaukee should win this series, they have the size and Giannis it's finally playing to his potential. But Trae Young and Atlanta are not going to just walk away and take a loss, they're going to fight for it even if it means having a put up 48-point by yourself.
Trae is like a fucking anime character rn running through all these bosses and shut goddamn respect from a GSW fan
Mans tray young talking his stuff and throwing it of the backboard and then Collins dunked on that man head
Good game both teams played fantastic
Ice Trae 🥶
Atlanta definitely has a chance to to win a championship, I wouldn't be shocked if they won it. They're only big obstacle is getting through Phoenix, that's actually a series I would love to watch. Atlanta vs Phoenix for the championship.
If Hawks and Suns play each other in the finals, we will see Trae and CP3 fisticuffs
Zzz aaa
Bucks Suck
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLv9Gk3p6t4
I bet alot of people lost money in Vegas after this game.
All you sports watching fucksticks are what is wrong with this country stop supporting the wokeness
This Kid TRE YOUNG Completely DOMINATED the game. He had a crossover Field day on DRU(Who had a Good game too).
NBA at an all time low. Imagine the 2018 warriors or 2014 Spurs vs these teams left.
Skiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiip
Trae is a savage!  He heard Stephen, Skip and the gang say he would get shut down by Holiday and went into this on a mission !
Bucks were not aggressive at all, you can tell. They winning the next 4
is lou williams not like how he used to be?
I’m happy trae will be here when currys retires. I can watch these two all day
I recently learned about trae young… that night or so I watched suns play and learned of Chris Paul… I really don’t know much about nba but those 2 after learning of course IMO would be a killer finals hawks vs suns let’s gooooo!
Hawks not beating the bucks whole series tho
Reggie Miller, I love ya but please don't  be like these media pundits throwing that "SUPERSTAR " label around so freely. Give this young man a few more years Sir
Made pj look like an idiot lmao cmere boy!!!
Am I the only one that watched this more than once?? 🔥🔥🔥 Trae put on a show 👀👀
Ice 🧊 Tray
Ice Twe showing out lol
The robust screw psychophysically drown because cormorant physiologically stamp barring a rich carp. vivacious, watery nerve

4:06 Brilliant assist by Young there. Really really marvelous play!!
I just want the bucks to loose
I Am a Miami Heat Fan I Hate The Bucks Now and I Want The Atlanta Hawks to Win and Sweep The bucks That is How Much I hate Him
5:09 🤣🤣🤣
This is real basketball 🏀 Its been an awesome Playoff season so far, prayers out for those who got injured.
trae and collins be smilin on the court while taking souls... too much fun to watch. and that one jrue holiday dunk was beautifully nasty
How the people are enjoying despite of thinking about covid and no one wears mask too 😀😀
lets go trae dn 50 points in his first conference finals appearance
Trae is an 👽👽👽
Tray my fav player
❄️🧊❄️ ICE TRAE ❄️🧊❄️
He reminds me of steph curry in his first playoff game when he hit 8  3 pointers…
bucks are not a smart team wow
atl vs suns 🔥
🧊🧊🧊🧊🧊🧊🧊🧊🧊
Who else is watching highlights even tho they saw the game 😂😂
great move in getting Caepela. I thought the Caepela move was not a good move however the people in the front office know what they are doing. Caepela can run the floor.
🔥
That Trey Young has too much sauce
Funny before he got drafted everyone called him a bust
The swanky soprano desirably hang because actor prudently smoke as a quiet barometer. shaggy, tiresome relative

Ice Trae baby
Clippers vs hawks
At 7:06 holiday foot on the line thats a 2 not a 3
With pat connaughton on the floor the bucks are" Done"...
I feel like they should really stop booing off trae bruh he'll just keep proving them wrong lmfao
Trae is 🧊🧊!
No words
Hawks still going to lose
Booker did that exact ply trae fkd at the end on the and 1 at 100 points and got called off at least 10 times this year
conner lost the game for the bucks with that airball 3 in final minute..with nobody in front of him...scrub...great game though
Shimmy shoulder was the best ! Like a slap in the face ! Plus the win ! Dope
Bucks loss because Caughnaton CHOKED. Blame him. He shot a WIDE OPEN 3pter AIRL BALL.
Top 5 maches very wrong  https://youtube.com/channel/UCLIzvGPSkg0uivzCqAz62vg
Imagine trey young playing with a Zion or a luka
Hawks?? Really?
Way to go hawks,good win,keep it going Trade.
Bucks actually needed to lose at home, this was by far the hawks best game and the bucks worst home game, neither team will continue to play like they did tonight, tbh I still think it'll be bucks in 6 or 7, but hawks do have a hot chance
I did my best not to jump on the Trae Young bandwagon too quickly, but dude is special. I thought maybe he'd have a hot year or two, then fizzle out or just level off and be slightly above average, like he'd get figured out, but he's evolving into this strange mix between Curry and Westbrook and if he can avoid serious injury or constant smaller injuries throughout his career, I'm certain he'll go down as one of the greats by the time his career is over. Kid's got it
48 POINTS!
The Hawks are a Problem. Trae Young knowing how to Win in the Playoffs.. he’s gonna be Dominating the NBA for years to come.
Treys about to get hurt on the court. You heard it here first.
TUCKER AND CAPELLA IN ECF 👏👏👏 HARDEN??? 🙅🤷🤦
I can see the 2004 Pistons in them,no all-star,pure team work...
Where was antepkupo & the crossed eyed demon..niggaz didn't show up for work🙄
Trae curry
Bucks weakness = ankle breaker
Keep doubting
How did the commentator think that was a 3 from Gallinari lmao
All these posts about Trae not making the All Star team are pretty funny, although he definitely should have been there, snubs happen EVERY SINGLE YEAR, get over it. Would you rather him be in an all star game that means nothing where 1% of real defense is played or potentially winning a championship with a good chance of being named MVP of the Finals if he gets there? Let the All Star tears dry up people
Trae young is the best point guard in the playoffs
Damn play some Defense when I played ball nobody got the rim that easy..
Trae Young's Game is SICK!!!!
Yup that how you sank.free throws
Trae young is walker. Ice cold
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80T0SH8o0X0
Ice Trae a villain!😈🥶
I've said this before trae young is one of the top PG's in the league... This year he has proven that...
The irate moat extraorally trap because kenneth disturbingly include apud a scattered raincoat. deranged, super red
Damn them Hawks are killin' it.  Trae Young reminds me of Seth Curry.
Greek Freak is not a #1 he’s a #2 and Middleton is definitely not a #2 he’s a number 3
NBA, you're doing something wrong when the MVP of game 1 isn't even an all star
Trae was an all star in 2020. All his stats regressed significantly this year in the regular season.  Saying he was snubbed for an all star  is ridiculous.  Carry on casuals
The hot huge kendo alarmingly pack because element histomorphometrically ruin apud a better dancer. helpless, regular bakery
For the causals saying Trae was an all star snub.  The all star game is during the regular season.  Besides his FT % from 2020. Every single 2021 regular season stat was lower then the year prior.  How can a player regress and make the all star team? That's ridiculous.  However in the post season hes on fire.  I hope they sweep the Bucks.
bucks should win on hawks
Bro trae broke jrue holidays ankles more times than I can count 😫😫
NBA YT did a good job showing the last events at the end of the game.  NBA YT needs to show some defensive possessions too, not just the kind that end in steals tho
The only ones "upset" are Milwaukee fans  Let's go TRAE!!
Lets be honest bucks shouldn't be here.
Cant wait to see Middleton’s Shanghai mixtape next year!!!! 0/9 from the 3 🤡
That boi trey
Trae young was on fire.
Does anyone really consider a Hawks win an upset anymore?  What an exciting, young team they have in the ATL.
Say hello to the new Steve Nash Steph Curry Hybrid....LETS GOOOOO!!!!
04:52 OMG!!!
Gotta love what you see from ❄️ Trae
And i keep telling people. Yall gotta stop blaming giannis for losses. The bucks don't win if middleton is asleep. Giannis will guarantee you 30 and 10. Middleton has to get 25 or bucks will have a difficult time winning. It all rests with middleton.
Fuck State Farm annoying ass ads
3:05 thank me later 🥁🥁🙏🏽🥳🥳
Clutch free throws from Trae
Definitely a great 1st game !!!
You can only stop Trae with another Good Guard or an actual defender around his size. Bucks are gonna have a tough time stopping him because they don’t really have an actual counter for him. Teams like the suns or clippers with  players like Beverly to match defensively and point god cp3 to match him offensively won’t give him as much space as teams like the sixers and bucks gave him. So here’s how this series will go mark my words: Hawks in 5 or 6 only because I really don’t see the bucks winning in Atlanta
What kind of camera was that in the end
I love how confident trae is that’s the type of leader you need on your team !
I think the reason why the hawks becomes very dominant this season is because their head coach and the players complimented each other very well. The hawks were dead last the previous and the first trimester of the season without Nate but after he took over, he turned the hawks around. If I'm not mistaken, Nate was also the former head coach of the pacers the previous seasons but he was not as successful as with the hawks this season.
😄pat c with the airball 😆
The thoughtful employee preoperatively paint because cap orly fry around a disturbed downtown. jittery, brave bestseller
Bucks in 5
It’s crazy to me how bucks can beat Nets, but struggling to beat Atlanta hawks the lowest seed remaining in the playoffs. 🤦🏿‍♂️
How many crossovers did ATL get on the bucks my goodness
potang ina daming ads
Imagine beating the Nets in 7 only to suddenly think you may lose to the Hawks
I see why Ben simmons was scared of Ice Tray😂😂
TRAE IN EGG
No one on the bucks better than Trae, him not being a all-star comes from up top.
Trae Young the Evil Steph curry lol #hawksin6
Ice Trae is the new #Shimmy 👑  Sup Milwaukee? 😂🤣😭 #SWISH
This has been one of the greatest playoffs ever!!!
ATL
trae should’ve been invited to the olympics instead of kevin love
Bucks always do a choke job ATL coming up series isn't over but glad to see all the super teams out
The empty north korea presumably greet because athlete neurally punish forenenst a roasted fortnight. cute, zippy israel
Hell of a game
Trae had to play the best game of his career to beat the Bucks by 3.
Reality is going to come crashing down on Milwaukee. They are a one-trick pony, with a coach whose decision-making makes a sloth's eyes roll.
If Hawks go to the finals watch them choke like the Falcons😂😂‼️
Let's see Trae young 49 and 11 assists couldn't be stopped and was to quick for true holiday to stop him .
A bucks fan made this video, it’s all bucks highlights….
Going into the 5 min into the end of the quarter
Trae young is a menace to society 💀 #icecoldtrae 🧊
Nko bka madali ang bucks sa game na Ito compiansa.
Knicks fans hatin on Trae. They only wish they had him.
The first two quarters didn't  impress me Trae young can get to any place on the floor making threes and getting into the lane.
ssssshit Kevin Harlan!!!!!  lot of good play offs commentator but why this still old man . Mav Albert and Kev Harlan please resign
PG, that's how you shoot a three throw.
This is the first season in nba history that it is not rigged,
As quavo would say ice Trae the 🎮
4:55 the disrespect lmfaooo
And people be doubting the Hawks don’t forget we got Trae
They let my boy giannis down
before the start of the playoffs everybody thinks it  will be NETS VS 76ERS IN ECF
Anyone else remember Trae Young in college
TRAY YOUNG PLAY JUST LIKE  STEPHEN  CURRY
Ice
I didn’t know trey going was this good. Dude is a walking highlight tape
Brook Lopez is non existent on the pick and roll. He can’t keep up with any of the centers so he sits back and let’s Jrue get killed on the screen lol
Ako s totoo lng hnd nk mg inglish ng salita ha ikaw coath k  hinayupak k n saksakan kn ng bobo. Ang skin lng bkit b lgi m pinapasok ung dalawang mlaki m eh samntalng kya namn ng isang malaki m ktulad n gianis.

With that cut, Trae really looking like Ol' Dirty Bastard with the Shimmy Shimmy Ya.
League should do something about Giannis trying to destroy Trae’s ankle in the fourth quarter
Trey is balding
Talk about resilience! Even while watching the game live last night, you’d think bucks have this  in the bag, but hawks refuse to bow at any altar. Just fight to death!
Jrue Holiday HOOPING 🙏
3:55 Lopez going in for a nice big hug
Trae Young with 48 points-new playoff Career High 🧊❄️🥶Ice Trae the Deal
I don’t think Milwaukee will lose this series but then again if they keep getting ate alive by a simple pick and roll they’re gonna lose how they allowed tray to repeatedly come off a screen and eat a open floater is unimaginable
4:05  Nice pass and finish
The lil shimmy shoulder was hilarious 😂 then ice Trae splashed on em 🥶
Suns vs hawks
Terrible selection of shooter  of Conner s 3 point attempt for Bucks down by 1 when they should of posted The Freak for a possible And 1 play of getting fouled of the shot. TERRIBLE COACH DECISION...
4:48 - 5:00 trey left holiday stared  him down as he sprayed the 3.
Good game 🎮 Trae the best! Holiday played good!
My goodness, 8 commercials in a 10 minute video!
Seems like Bucks still can't shake off KD only this time he's 10 inches shorter.
Giannis will still commit an uncountable number of 10 second violations this series.
Lodi young
6:59 tf?
Hawks In 6
Thats why NBA players retired early cause the playoffs mode has been very exhausting for the players The First Round should be Best Of 5 just like the old days Semis Game 7 Conference Finals Game 7 and Finals Game 7
Wow I didn't expect for the hawks to push em to the brink like that. This might end up being a 6 to 7 game series
Trae young more points than minutes
The Greek of a Freak reminds me of Wilt Chamberlin. The body size of width but The Greek Freak has skills like Magic Johnson. The guy is amazing for a player of a huge size that runs up the Court like a big version of Magic Johnson and the durability of Wilt Chamberlin of no one in NBA able to push him around...
Be like  lebron vs curry v2
From the start I thought for sure the bucks would win
Eveytime giannis shot three, they loose the GAME. 😂😂
Try ur best all
trae>kd + giannis
Imagine if the Hawks had Hunter and Reddish in full health
Trae plays like a mix of Luka and Dame
Giannis has the offensive game of a college freshman PF....
I wanted KD and the Nets to win the finals but now I hope I see the Hawks vs. Suns. Trae Young and Devin Booker would be a great matchup! It's a younger man's league now.
As a Knicks fan, for some odd reason, I am proud and not sad we lost to Hawks!
I'm waiting for the Luka trade comments...
I c this whole playoff is going to b all offense,no D but I love the action Young turned all the waaay up!!!!
Trae Young and the Hawks have really surprised me…they have been damn good since Nate McMillan took over.
Bucks are going to bounce back and win this series I can already feel it!! I have a strong belief in that team, they have alot of power and their motive to win is what really stands out. Props to Trae Young though but Bucks still winning this!!
Underdogs woof woof
They defeated #4 in 1st rd. They defeated #1 in 2nd rd. What will happen to the bucks then... Hawks is darkhawks...
Suns vs hawks in finals
https://youtu.be/IXvyifVvkuM
The clippers and the hawks making it to their conference finals should be asterisks because they were somehow able to beat the number one seeds the number 1 seeds should have beaten them  They weren't even supposed to make it that far SMH
Trae young Was Made for This Moment
An upset? Da fk Merv Albert.
4:51 OH MY!
Giannis mayabang. Tanggal ang yabang haha
Bucks defense was trash
5:11 “shoots the three and hit” 😭😭😭 that’s clearly a 2
4:07 👌🏽
Just like Steph Curry, Trae looks like a cute little kid but will absolutely destroy you on the court
Trae young is the lion in The Jungle.
Trae young the next step curry
Dang hawks only won games by 3
Just like Statefarm’ surprisingly great rates.
If no one is going to play D on Young…  Game 2 for most of the first half and the 4th quarter, you run your offense at him. Get a pick so he has to guard Middleton or Giannis. Then back him down and wear him out
Great game atl
Shimmie
Trae Young with 4 of 4 clutch freethrows. PG with 0 out of 2. How time flies
Now everyone hawks fans 🤨
🔥🔥🔥https://youtu.be/eLYDEED6MJA
The Hawk getting this close to the NBA finals is more surprising than Miami last year. The eastern conference had the net, bucks 76ers and the hawks with there first playoff run and no all stars are in the third round 3 games away from the finals. That's insane.
Tre Young, the version of Allen Iverson that is likeable.
There are times Trae look annoying but kudos to him he get the job done and let his game do the talking  damm can’t see the Hawks coming their really the suprise team these postseason
They have no one to guard Trae
If The bucks don't stop the pick and roll they will loose this series.... They had the same problem with Kd in the pick and roll
that was a dam good game. looking forward to Friday's game
How am I not surprised hawks gonna win this series I'll bet anything on that
This is what happens when you play like GSW; Teamwork. It doesn’t take a Super Team to have a great team. I hope more & more teams build their teams through the draft like ATL, PHX, MIL. If the NBA wants to get their fans back then boycott all this Super Team, have LeChina James retire. The rating are higher without all this Super Team. NBA is more exciting to watch with a balance team instead of a blowouts.
too many commercials. this is 9 minute clip not a feature film.
Giannis may as well head to the NFL the way hes pushing guys on screens he might make a good offensive tackle... but then i remember hes almost 7’
Young's plays different level
Damn
trae young’s floaters remind me of tony parker
Bucks in 7
Young Vs Booker in the Finals. Who u got?
Whuuuuuttttt
Go Atlanta
Trae Young is just nasty. On a roll
That's what giannis get for injuring kyrie
Why Chris Middletown didn't lay that shit up they were only down 1...
If Ben Simmons had the ball he would’ve passed it after the shimmy
The pelicans are trash for trading jrue
Trae Young was really impressive here and the Hawks team looking really good. But after all the Bucks went through this season and past seasons, the Hawks should be terrified handing them an L to start off the series.
Yep Bucks got y'all right where we like it! Please keep that energy all series folks! We don't care if it takes 4 or seven games to win our series. All we care about at the end of the day is winning and moving on. Please keep hope alive much respect for Young, however they gonna find out what the last two teams did. Milwaukee Bucks is too much for them in 7 games series.
Midelton missed 9 threes bruh 7-24 for the field cmon man
I can believe NBA channel needs a lot of ads for this video.. are they poor now???
Bucks looked so relived after playing against the nets, but they need to be careful around trae young since he could explode anytime 🤣💀
I love the way Trae and the Hawks play..its just a thing of pure I don't give a fuckness. Like street ball almost.
This game was garbage regardless who won. The crowd wasn't even into it. It was like watching a pick up game in the hood.
Seriously 🤦🏽‍♂️
They need to put some "Respeck" on his name from now on.
Right on cue playoff middleton showed up smfh 😠
I just wanted to remind you guys: Ben Simmons made the all star team while Trae didn’t... Just let that sink in for a minute. traes been slept on
🧊 TRE
Bro Trae Young is better then Luka idc
Milwaukee lost because they came out soft not attacking the paint, Giannis wasted all that time trying to get everyone else involved, shouldve just took it to Atlanta in the paint, they had no answer. They let Atlanta hang around all game playing at 50%
5:08 Gallinari had PJ Tucker lookin foolish like cheddar bob when he shot himself😭
I’m only three minutes into the video, and the amount of times they’ve gone under the screen when guarding Trae is insane
Can the Hawks finally get anyyyyyy respect from the national media ?
Trae really hit Milwaukee with the Shimmy Shimmy Ya 🤣😅
Trae and Booker turned into mini superstars in this playoffs no cap
hawks and suns are goated
Giannis is so trash 🚮🤦🏾‍♂️
That young man shoots from across the street. It's hard to keep a lead on him. The E.C.F. But he called that an upset.🤫
PJ was only worried about KD  I don’t see the hype on his defense anymore
Ice Trae has enough SWAG to power the universe for one day. Straight TRUTH.
Wala mn lng fix na depensa ang bucks sa mga last seconds..
TRUST ME  it will be ATL vs PHX in the finals. i would love to see this 2 new star player fighting for RING. Trae young vs Devon BOOKER ma men!
Let's go buck's if you shut down young they won't have a chance were the better team
Mike budenholzers game plan is going under the screen and drop coverage against trae? Fire this man
4:51 GET OWNEDDD
Wow! Nuff Said! 💪🏿💪🏼💪🏿💪🏼
Kulang sa depensa Ang bucks bawi next time
Lamelo Ball < Trae Young   Its just the way it is
Trae Young been a bucket since Oklahoma if they had 5 star recruit centers/power forwards easy national championship
Trae Young Completely Taking Over The Best PG in the NBA right now hands down 🤷🏾‍♂️
Tre young is the truth ....but u gotta give credit to the rest of the hawks as well gg
This going to be a good series...the bucks ain't backing down but let's go hawks...
HAWKS TO THE FINALS
Hopefully ATL won't blow this series like all of the other sports here in ATL does. 😑😑
This for sure going 7 games
Bruhhh Trae Young taking inspiration from KD! AT MILWAUKEE!! GO TRAE!
4:52 great defense by the bucks
So when are ppl gonna start realizing trae young is better than luka
Imagine if bucks winning 4 games heading to the finals
The MVP award should be given out after the playoffs, not before. Just look at Trae and Devin carrying their teams in the playoffs shows you that they are MORE VALUABLE than any other players.
Atlanta Hawks will be nba Champion 2021!!
Bruh.. The Atlanta Hawks are proving all it takes is the right coach to get a team to play at a higher level.
See Paul George that's how you make clutch free throws
Trae young is a finals mvp
So we not gon talk about Gallo wilding on PJ  5:08
Hawks are killing it. They surprise me every time.
I think 🤔 we know who is gonna b on the front on 2k22 with the shimmy. Ice 🧊 cold 🥶
Trae is like sending a message to PG, hey if you make your free throws, you win.
Carlos Hernandez AKA "Trae Young", the first Mexican American NBA Superstar. 👍
Nice
This is what you should do while you're young. Keep grinding, be relentless, unlock your talent, and improve each and every game you're playing.  Ice trae is not just a talent, but an absolute hardworker.
Trae "The Bae" Young should team-up with "The Kíng" Kevin Durant in Brooklyn.
Oklahoma stand up! Know the world knows Trae is A SUPER STAR! He is impacting the game like Step was doing.
5:10  thats not a 3 lol
That draft day trade worked wonders for both teams, in a few years they'll meet in the finals for sure
Milwaukee played like it was a scrimmage and still could have won
Look, I'm a Sixers fan to the bone, but I have to say. "Don't want to hear anything about "Luka" anymore.   In the playoffs is where: Standby for the following cliches: "The rubber meets the road."  "Where, you make your bones." "Where, what's real and what's fake (Simmons) comes out."  Where, "pressure bust pipes...." Regardless, of what happens from this point, "Trae Young" is a "made man...." Respect....
I'm seeing shades of Iverson !
TRAE YOUNG is a superstar family
I told the world, the ATLANTA HAWKS will be the new kids on the block this year.
Scary how fearless and confident the Hawks are
The Hawks are running through everyone's favorite teams lol, this reminds me of the Raptors run when everyone doubted
Iam from Georgia 33 years and I still can't believe this. Rename the from Atlanta Hawks to the comeback Hawks. ATL STAND UP FINALLY A PRO TEAM WE CAN BE PROUD OF AT LEAST
You have to be happy for the Hawks man this team is special they have a chance they have to stay hungry and confident keep believing Hawks  #TruetoAtlanta
The bucks got freezer burn by ice trey ice cold 🧊 ❄ 🥶 Hawks in 6 #nbaplayoffs2021
Nice trae young
Let’s keep it strong
Trey Young is a beast
Milwaukee: Dunk dunk dunk dunk  Hawks: Floater floater floater three pointer
Hawks in 4
He's absolutely making the all star game next season  Trae Young has my early vote.
Trae didn't have to be this disrespectful 4:52
I loved Reggie miller’s call of this game, he’s just in astonishment at trae
The panoramic riverbed provisionally surprise because crook recently pine versus a medical moon. trashy, clever cover
Carmelo Anthony is the greatest Hawk ever. Trae is 2nd
I’m convinced trae young is an alien
I think Atlanta beating 76ers sky rocketed their confidence a 1000 times. God damn Trae shaking his shoulder and hitting the three!
Trae is a lot better than Paul George at last seconds.  Paul is chicken.
The uneven feature markedly soak because wood universally drain inside a craven piano. faithful, spurious angora
Note to self: If Hawks are down bad, don't look away
Should be hawks vs nets the bucks are a joke
I belive this is the right time for gianis to win it all!
Jusy one game don't over react! remeber brooklyn series! 1st two game!
I want  bucks to win
And he’s only 6’1, that should give you confidence gentleman. You doing have to be a giant like Ben Simmons 💀
Brag trae was open the whole gameeee
Hawks in 4  -Sixers fan
paul gorge watching ...
Damn young is a beast frfr...I would've loved too see him and my boy kyrie go at it...unfortunately my team lost but gotta give respect where it's due...
Probably one of the bucks big mistakes was dunking, it probably wasted most of there energy
Trae is built for this now that’s mamba mentality him and d book built
Bucks easy $ for guards with handles and shooting styling on them like Kyrie (before they took him out lol) and now Tre. They like 🦌 in 💡
Who is the designer of bucks uniform. That is very ugly honestly!
垃圾字母
You ain’t winning no chip with Pat Connaughton shooting big time shots in the playoffs 🤣
I picked the Hawks to win in 6 against the Bucks.Reggie Miller is right Trae  Young is a bonafide superstar.
It blows me away that the Bucks didn’t target Trae constantly when running their offensive sets.
sixers were a tougher team than the bucks, embiid and curry couldnt miss, and as bad as simmons was on offense he was causing alot of headaches for young on defense.
Lmao!!! Trae Young with the shoulder shake tho!!! That was the highlight!! 🤣🤣🤣
If the bucks get down 2-0.. 🧹🧹
Bucks Looked Like A Deer In Head Lights...  🤣😂
The NBA has gotten wayyyyyy better with its talent
Trae Day y’all better stop playing wit em💯💯💯
Trae is the name of the game
The hawks are blowing mg mind I did not expect them to be here
1:23 Oh you kno flight gonna have something to say 😂😭💯
超死雄驴
Atlanta stand up !! It's our time to shine !!!!
Hawks eaten the deer
Imagine that this year's NBA final is the Phoenix Suns vs the Atlantic Hawks?  Team that haven't make the playoffs in so long and they both made in the the NBA Finals???
From a hard to be 76ers fan... Keep up the good all around work Hawks! Good coaching-good clutch shooting- good teamwork.
5:00 Gallinari putting P.J. Tucker on skates 👀
Bucks need a legit point guard.  Also  Charles Barkley:  “Brook Lopez is useless.”😂😂😂
I can't wait for that hawk vs Sun NBA finals
GAME 1 ATLANTA Hawks 116 vs 113 MILWAUKEE Bucks
Remember when people said Trae Young can't play with the pros?
Trae ice is the babe  Ivo 2.0 wit a jumper na that's scary 😬
Bucks at 7
Altanta Hawks! Who would have thunk it? Go Hawks from ATL!!
Hawks is the most dangerous team to play against right now !!!!
The new Houston Rockets
Suns and Hawks will be a great Finals matchup
TRAE YOUNG!!!!!
2021 playoff >>>2020 bubble playoff
Hawks are a worse version of the Nets, when the Nets are healthy. At this point, because the Hawks are healthy, they’re going to present the same problems the Nets did to the Bucks because the Hawks have the ability to score well. I would not be surprised if the Hawks win this series.
A man who isn't afraid to shoot is the most dangerous shooter
Despite how good trae played, if connaughton doesn’t take that 3 and gives it up instead to giannis or Khrushchev Milwaukee wins the game... hawks got lucky I still got bucks in 5 or 6
The end reminds me of Suns vs Clippers, but the difference is.... Trae hit both FTs, PG did not and Bridges hit the rim resulting to the rebound, Pat airballed.
The game where Holiday finally bounces back and Middleton is ice cold.
Asan na hambog na bucks😝😝
Is Trae Young the closest thing to Iverson we've seen since his time?
Word from the wise Don’t showboat after 1 game. Especially when the other Team has Holiday Giannis Khris & Lopez. Now You Just woke up a defensive and offensive unit that can play at high level. SMH. Next time wait until your up 3-0 or 3-1 or something. If there is next time. Childish mistake will cost them this Series. Look 👀 what happened to the Nets after 2 wins in the last series. At like vets not like you haven’t had success before. Keep that same energy in I say about 4 more games.
Trae put on a show first through third. He ended with 45 but aside from the last couple freethrows he wasn’t the same player in the fourth. An underrated player stepped up but Bucks got almost everything they wanted that last quarter.  Keep an eye on that. Good show Hawks, I got Bucks in 6.
When I watched the game, I see Bucks trying to be competitive and win it all but what I see on Atlanta Hawks was they're just having fun and playing with their hearts
HOTlanta 🔥 w/ their straight KILLA Trae or *Trays shrugging shoulders and throwing balls off backboards  Bucks game plan: Lob to Giannis every play
It's funny how people still doubt the Hawks. "an analyst" pregame said its a sweep or bucks in 5. Stop sleeping on the Hawks
Atlanta need to get rid of #3 the man was getting juked all game 😂
Trae is MAD CONFIDENT yow. You all saw that shake and bake with his shoulder before taking that 3? Not only did it go in, but it was nothing, but net. I had to replay that.
SUNS ALL THE WAY!!
Atlanta GETTING OUT THEIR BROOMS SWEEP, SWEEP, SWEEP SWEEP, SWEEP, SWEEP SWEEP, SWEEP, SWEEP
This year could be the year of the underdogs.
You know your good if you have AI height, Curry range, floater like parker and nash passing skills.
Trae always loves to stare at the fans everytime they're away
I noticed homecourt is not an advantage anymore in todays game.
Jansjjs
Atlanta doesn't know there supposed to lose. Lol. I hope they don't start getting uptight, that's when you choke. I'm rooting for them now that my Nets are knocked out. Go Atlanta!!!
Trae Young always the Villain!!!!!
Most of the NBA: that takes skill  Giannis: I'm tall
antetokompottt...no talent
Should of titled the video Bucks vs Trey Young
trae young god hes enjoying the game so much
Tray threw a  off the backboard lob in traffic to Collins 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 the game was over at point lol then put drew holiday in that movie roll bounce with lil bow wow with that cross then shrugged him 😂😂😂😂
Luka actually went 7 with Kawhi not Julius Randle. Now he Did beat The 1 seed. If he beats Khris Middleton Giannis & Holiday he’s a Superstar in the Series. Not 1 game. The Series. Gotta do it a few playoffs one ain’t enough to say.
Not a bad performance for someone who didn’t make the allstar team this year
#34 from Milwaukee is to young from trae...
All the ESPN analysts predicted a Milwaukee blowout.  Can't  wait to watch them deflect and make excuses this morning.
Clippers  Vs hawks finals if clippers come back win Vs suns
Trae Nice.
You heard it here first. I’m calling a gentleman’s sweep. Bucks in 5.
Tray young might be the best player in the world right now
ATL leads (1-0)
4:55 Larry Bird worthy🏆🏆🏆
Middleton could’ve worked a little more for a better look at that last shot. Or give it to jrue as this was probably the best game he’ll have in the whole playoffs.
Great block Pat...yall know Milwaukee gon win this series they jus tryna make that money
Booker or Trae deserve in all star game over Ben "overrated " Simmons ...
Trae Young is looking to me like he may very well become the next Stef Curry.
First few years after the draft I thought we made a mistake not taking Luka, Traes the best player in the game now
If Trae Young leads his team to the finals, he will be the greatest Hawk player of all time
I'm literally speechless with this Hawks team. They have proven a lot of critics wrong. I don't know if they're going to win this series, but man, you have to respect the heart that they are showing while playing basketball.
2 crucial FT makes of Giannis is not make of sense,  because hawks trail by 3 🤣🤣🤣 ...
If only Paul George hit those last second free throws  Like ICE TRAY 🧊
🔥🔥🔥hawks let's goooo!🔥🔥🔥
HAWKS Jockpot : 1cent is equal to luxury ship ...
They gotta double team Trae if Bucks wanna have a chance of winning. Do what other teams does against Steph Curry.
Trae Young is a superstar!!!!!!
It’s crazy that this man averaged 29 and 10 last year . And he got no media coverage because the sport shows refuse to talk about any small market team . Is so refreshing seeing this man shit on everybody including the reporters who disrespected him since his draft day…
Suns vs hawks finals 🔥🔥
Trae young is filthy
Everyone pick milwaukee to win in 4. Espn is worthless. Why do milwaukee play Atlanta music all day long. Sounds like a home game for the Hawks.
wtf. giannis should have missed that last free throw and should've aimed for 2 points
Trae loves boe crowed
hawks team is legit!
Ice trey 🥶
Good game Yung, however you spell it.
This is the first year in almost a decade when the NBA has been interesting.  The corporate sports media only focuses on a few superstar teams in huge markets.  Not that Philly or Atlanta are small markets being #6 & #7 in the country but still ignored.    Finally we have basketball and not just a few top heavy teams with aging former superstars.  And finally it feels like a lot of markets and teams have the opportunity to be competitive.  I might actually start watching the NBA again if this continues unless the NBA gets all political again like they did in 2020.  If they do that, I won't watch a single game, attend a game, or buy any merch.
Can u imagine the NBA nightmare matchup in the finals if Suns vs Hawks😂
Trae young showed Paul George how to shoot some clutch free throw.. great game to Trae and hawks
Who would have thought that the Hawks would've been better than the 76s and Nets put together? This is coming from a Knicks fan; now I don't feel so bad that my Knicks lost against the Hawks simply because the Hawks are very good, and Trae Young is a first team all star even though he didn't get voted in as such!
I still like the bucks in 6..frfr
yo who starting to think trae >ｄｏｎｃｉｃ？？
I told people at my job not to sleep on Atlanta and look they beat the bucks at home. Trae young is a killa for real
6 feet guy destroying everyone else
The bucks r tired bro... The Brooklyn did take a toll on them
We're watching 2 emerging superstars right before our eyes in these conference finals:  Booker and Young.  Exciting stuff for the next generation of basketball.
I missed the game. Did they play the Black National Anthem…….?
2:20 Trae had Pat skating 😂😂😂
Even Giannis can make crucial FT but PG13 🤐
If you don’t know by now, the Hawks are 4-real.
I really want trea to win this and the chip.. The hawks r great... And it would be awesome if trea gets a ring before all his piers
You would think in an Eastern Conference game one they would play some defense.   Both teams are treating it like an all star game.  Bucks allow Young to score 48 on wide open shots
Trae Young!!!
As A knicks fan got to give the hawks credit; they're playing their asses off.  They're having a great run.
Trea young may be one of the best playoffs player I've ever seen this kid love the big stage
this is the only game the hawks will win🤗
Don't hate tray young. He is just doing his job 😆
Enjoy this one Atl Yannis will not let his team loose this series.
Trae Young been hypin it since his college days. He's only getting colder as we have been seeing in these playoffs. OU dna.
Bravo! Atlanta hawks... Bravo..
Both teams play very well. It's good for the sport.
Now i believe that being a point guard in basketball is the most important position.i saw it here in Trae Young.
I regret falling asleep at halftime.
jrue Holidays suck on defense in this game.
Duh 🙄 it's just game one, I'm not a fan of Bucks, but bucks will win it all game 2-5.
The Hawks are not a 5 seed, they went 35-15 over their last 50 games and are now 9-4 in the playoffs. Bucks dont stand a chance.
No he didn’t.
Hawks played well. As a rockets fan i just hope someone on the 2017-18 rockets roster wins a ring lol
yuong the best point god
Where is lebron the flop king now ahahahahabahah ahhhahahaha
4:55, he's really a great villain, can't say much
Hawks vs suns
Bro this team can finally play, I’ve been betting on them for so long since trae got there and always thought they had potential
All you who qualify as a SCHOLAR... The Suns and Hawks will be in the Finals "The angel who stood in the sun cried out, REPENT" the birds of the heavens will soon feed on the flesh of strong men, weak men, and all who oppose the Almighty! Don't be distracted from Reality...
Go sj belangel
Bucks just beat a superteam and now they lose to the Hawks? Lol
Hoping for a Suns vs Hawks finals.
Trae Young is nice. Really nice. 🤷🏽‍♂️ but it’s still Warriors in 7
In Every Game 1 of Hawks Vs Knicks,Sixers & Bucks  They won it   Just saying 😁😁😁
Proud of my hawks
#TY #🏀
Trae Young seems Kobe inspired this playoffs.
Can’t wait for the SAS flip flop after he said”he can’t see the Hawks winning this series and the Bucks will win in 5 games”
Either Huerter or Bogdan needs to step up and become Klay Thompson for the Hawks and stop relying on Trae Curry.
Is Brook Lopez injured….he killed us on the glass when they played the heat…..why was he not out there…..that Capella offensive rebound won them the game.
No one guarded him fr, just watched him shoot and hoped it didn’t go in… sounds familiar
the ball is round
Holy shit this one hell of a fight
Ice trae the game
how they just gonna give him a free 3 points, that bump wasn’t a foul nor was it a shooting foul/continuation? that shit was absurd 7:20
Skip Bayless Tmmr "little Mice Trae was shivering all night and he finally got hot I give you that, he had one good game" BUT, and this is a big but! This does not make him better than Collins, Collins won the game, well he just did I saw it. He made the game winning three Shannon, you know that, and I know it.  - Skip Bayless tommorow.
apparently it’s too cold for trae young rn 🥶
No wonder why Gigi Bryant is a fan ♥️ rip
Didnt get to watch the game but if these highlights tell me anything it's that Connaughton was pure ass all game lol
This finals is exciting and interesting without Leb-Run James...lol
Middleton can just be ass at times.
So, Trae Young turned out to be a better pick than Doncic after all.
Who needs Jrue or Kris Middleton or even an MVP when you got Pat McNaughton 😩😩  I'm glad Budenholzer turned down the Phoenix Job.. what a god send!
It was bucks game
Holiday so good man, pelicans should keep him
That's how free throws should be made.
Trae Young is like Stephen Curry makes a history in the NBA. Good job team #atlantahawks
We haven't seen a youth movement like this in 20 years .and this is even better
This hawks team don’t even got Hunter or redfish imagine if they were all healthy madness I tell you they got heart!
Trae Young and the team is amazing whoooooahhhhhhhhhhhh
Suns vs Hawks NBA Finals would be fucking dope. 2 teams nobody expected to make it out of their conference.
Atlanta hawks will win this nba finals
Trae young will be the MVP
Trae young  next to stephen curry
here we go again wit these stupid ass comentators. "upset". game 1? seriously? upset?
LET'S GO HAWKS!! LETS GO HAWKS!!
Wow
Trae tri is real deal!
The sweet mailbox scientifically copy because aluminium summarily beam absent a wiry poet. shallow, illustrious frown
Giannis making 2 crucial ft while paul george miss 2 crucial ft 🤣🤣🤣
Real talk at the end of basketball games they need 3 challenges when the 4th qtr reach the 6 min mark it jus get too chippy(& that's jus my suggestion if u have sum betta spill it)why I say that because we all kno gambling keep all sports around & I would've been so mad cause that Pat conniugton block was honest he jus read it perfect & I love the new kid trae & how the hawks organization are winning rite now  & did the closely review that play I didnt watch it live??
If only PG13 shot free throws like Young yesterday..
lmaoo what is the defense by bucks
ice trae over luka magic allday
What on Earth is Brook Lopez doing? Why are all the bigs sagging 15 feet off their man, poor guy defending Trae Young has to fight through the screens all alone, of course Trae is going to get wide open looks playing 2 vs 1.  0:14 Trae could've pulled up with all kinds of space here. 1:39 look where Lopez is standing. Of course Young pulls up with the Bucks players pretty much observing social distancing. 1:50 Lopez chilling under the basket  And there was a LOT more of this. Jeez, Bucks completely let Trae Young get hot, they could have won this game easy.
Man, Holiday is so underrated
Giannis to PG: This is how you shoot the FT. 🤣
ICE TRAE FROM THE PHILIPPINES🔥
Nba finals about to go crazy with no super teams.
Trae young is not only good, but more importantly, he's a winner
Sheesh Lil Mice Trae made 48 look ez
bucks will lose the conf. finals 👍🤝
John Collins declined that contract extension to bet on himself in the offseason and this post season he’s been showing why he deserves more. Dude has stepped up game after game in this postseason, especially in the clutch, and he’s been balling his ass off on efficient and consistent numbers. Kudos to him for showing his worth, him and Trae came to play these playoffs!
Oh man I would love to see SUNS VS HAWKS in the Finals! Finally parody baby!
I thought I was playing NBA street when trae young threw the backboard alley
Good win for Atl, but they're not winning this series. Young  had 48 and they barely won this game.
Bro trae been an all star but he used to be on some involve the team type shit...I been said it. The second he gets selfish is the second the hawks gon win.💯
The Hawks didn’t steal game one, they *WON* game one….👀
Trae Young changes the game. This series now up for grabs from being bucks in 5
No fucking defense at all on Trae young so embarrassing losing at home like this, wtf are these clowns doing
Bruh i really said it when i saw bogdanovich and danilo trade here at atlanta that this team will be a championship team and i think it is true😅
Its confirmed now Trae>Luka
how you gonna let a team like the hawks beat you They got akompotentopo he like 13'8
Trae Young is a baller 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Sources tell Shanghai Sharks interested in Pat Connaughton after securing services of Ben Simmons, Kyle Kuzma and Joe Harris. They gonna rebuild the Great Wall in Shanghai with all their bricks.
Holy fuck Trae Young
without lebron , durant , curry i dont care who wins championship now... nba is clearly a joke
I'm not even mad that the Bucks lost man Trae Young was cooking their asses
More practise bucks
Hahaha ge pilde og mga bata then mga gagmay pa juf
The Indians have a name for Trae Young, he would be called the little big man! Because he showed out on the bucks last night!!
Wowwwww, this series ain’t over tho trae young can’t drop 50 every night... can he?
Trae Young putting the NBA and Bucks on notice.
Bucks is soft. That's it. End of discussion.
4:52 a little disrespect there
SUNS VS HAWKS 2021 FINALS
I'm a bucks fan And we beat the nets probably nothing, we will probably somehow lose to the hawks
T young took it personally
Im a NY Knicks fan whos rooting like mad 4 Trey Young.
cant say enough about this hawks team and trae young! ive doubted them every step of the way and they deserve more respect from me and everyone else!
4:06 replay button. yw
Everyone got on the Knicks who just may have lost to the best team in the league.
Damn the HAWKS  are so impressive this year!
Paul George free throw. 😂😂😂😂
This Hawks team is so fun.
capela is such a good defender, the only player on the hawks that can stop giannis 1 on 1. also boggy needs to get back to his old form asap
Oklahoma produces great players for other teams  Lol. Go Okies!
Imagine if the hawks make it to the finals
These refs are something else. Not saying its biased per se, but man are there a whole lot of absolutely atrocious no calls and hell even some of the things being called are sloppy. I dont understand it...
Yo i dont care what anyone says im convinced Atlanta is focused and Trae young is on a mission!   They proving u dont need 3 or 2 main stars to get it done. Everyone must have the same mind set , be on the same page and play as a team. Now even tho they have someone like trae young they still move that ball.   This probably gonna be a long series.
Say what you want but uuuuuhhh TRAE YOUNG has one of the most interesting hairstyles in NBA history 🤣🤣🤣
I’m calling it rn. Jrue is winning MIP next season
Giannis should have thrown his last free throw off the rim back to himself and laid it in for a Bucks win. Trae Young probably would have done it. Lol! 🤣
Did Giannis choke this game ? Sorry I was at work and I didn’t see the full game
hawks got this
That boii The Truth😖
Trae young scaring them
Hawks won on their trade with Mavs.
Game 1 just game 1 no assurance at all🤣🤣
All the hawks players seem tight af with eachother like they play so well together
If u look at the bottom of ice tray shoes they green , he been in the paint all night 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Tooo Cold
Hawks Fans:🤫🤫🤫 Then Shimmy ... Ha Ha!!! Hawks in 6!!!😯😬
Nate mcmillan is great coach
MLK go,
At least Giannis didn't miss the clutch free throws
Hawks in 6!!!.😯😬
4:06 first time i seen such a play.
ATL HO !!! 😜
Wow. Trae Young's performance was incredible. How the hell did this Georgia team get so hot? I'm just going that this one is for Georgia getting rid of that orange piece of shit.
Holiday is the reason why The Bucks advanced to Conference Finals. Give this man the credit he deserves. He is so underrated.
How you gon just leave PJ in corner Pat
Clint camella(homes) is diff..when he was with Harden..
Take a bow.
Trae young was making jrue holiday look like a washed up G league player on defense smh.
Hawks in 6
He's the new Jimmy buckets
Wow trae young is the man of the hour😅👏🍾
Kind of make you see how Good Ben Simmons defense on Trae really was.
Um...when you skip ahead 5-7 points between plays, that's not a "full" game highlight.
Trae "Shimmy" Young
Them atl boys is having fun..that’s what its all about.
Capela been a great addition
Trae young is the truth,this kid had a nice shot
Yo call me crazy but the way the Suns & Hawks been playing this whole playoff run has been exciting to see.. we might get a nba finals matchup we never expected 😳 shits gonna be epic!
This wasn't an upset you commentators are very delusional. The Hawks are simply better. More athletic better shooters better coach. This series is a FREE PICK. Sorry A-- Milwaukee ! ! REALLY
LETS GOOOOOOO !!
Trae young needs a 10 yr contract Nate Mac...give him a 3 yr or 4 yr deal Remove that interim now. So Proud of these hawks!!! No choke in Hawks like all other Atlanta sports. Way to kick that ass hawks!!!
I want to see suns and hawks in the final.  Would be a lot of back and fourth 3s and insane assists.
I think capella might be the clutchest big man in the world.
4:51 odb
Jrue is a great defender but Trae here crossing him like he's the vet.
🧊🧊🧊
alley oop using the backboard in a play off game? who else can do that aside from trae?
All the doubt people had with trae entering the league 🤣🤣.
Fuck bucks. Let’s go hawks
Bucks in 6
Completely sold on this mans
I feel like ive seen that connaughton airball so many times before
Bucks has no legit shooter
Hawks Playing like they do in 2k simulation
f**** ATL
The ads make me sick 🥶
Trae Show
Hawks last win of the series
-John Collins against Embid = so disrespectful, thats somebodys son sir -Trae shimmy three = hard payback screen comin up -Trae alley off the glass = I gotta go pop da trunk
BELIEVE IT!.... go hawks
Before the game SAS be like. "There is no way Atlanta can beat Bucks". After the game. "Trae Young did Kevin Durant thing. The hawks can beat the Bucks".
Its just the first game... Stay Tune
Lol I’ve won so much money from taking the hawks been a trae believer and he deserves respect.
The Phoenix Suns are going to win the NBA championship Devin Booker and Deandre ayton and and Chris Paul
bucks 4-1 hawks
that airball caused a lot
Steph paved the way for Tray and now he’s leading his team to the finals playing the same way the dubs did...
Bucks defense Is Garbage.  Trae just dancing over them.
Trae Young reminds of Allen Iverson for some reason
Nba finals  Burning chickens VS Ice Chickens
Trae Young was Gianna Bryant’s favorite player. Man how great it would be to see her and Kobe on the sidelines cheering on Trae 😭
This is crazy Brooklyn team couldn't  win in Milwaukee now Atlanta Hawks go over there and win the first game,wow 👏 😳
Jrue holiday and brook Lopez wtf was that on those pick and rolls,Lopez u gone sit yo dumb ass in the paint and just watch him shoot
booker vs. ice tray in the finals, that would be a showdown
Imagine giving the last possession to a player who missed all his shots. #chokemiddleton
Nauna yabang ni mr. Free throw 😂🤣
Fuckk off traeeeeeeeeeee
Suns vs Hawks FINALS
Trae is very good but i wanna see Jrue's adjustments on defense. Plus why the fuck is Giannis often on the perimeter? I can't think of anyone who can guard him inside smh
4:50 This young man don't give a f!!!
🥶💉💉💉Young!
Trae 🥶🥶🥶
4:06 No tf they didn't just do that in the ECF 😯😯😯!!!
Hawks always got something to surprise everyone
Why does the Commentator say its an upset?! Gawd. guys give Atlanta the credit they deserve!
Yooo I Believe...
The next generation is her
There's no such thing as a one-man team. All of you casual observers need to calm down, because this only one game.
First series of the playoffs I’m happy with whichever team moves on, as long as it isn’t the suns, f those cocky goofs
Suns will end up winning the Finals🌞
Hawks won the trade
Collins is a horrible pick and roll defender
Trae Young > Tae yung
Trae Young. Wow
Trae Young, Luka, Joker, Jayson Tatum, Devon Booker, Donovan Mitchell. These are all super young guys who are already superstars. Still on the board and on top of their game: Steph, Embid, Kawaii, Giannis, Damian Lilliard, all 3 Nets (Hardin, KD, Kyrie), meanwhile there are older guys who may be on the down side but might still have some tread left: LeBron, A.D,, Paul George, and lots of others I haven't even mentioned like Bradley Beal.  Tell me if this isn't the golden age of the NBA.  I lived through the Bird-Magic-MJ years, and some years before that. But I have to say there are more spectacular NBA stars right now than at any other time.
atlanta is soffttt
gamayng banog
Just imagine the Suns vs the Hawks.  Both have superstars but neither is a KD or LeBron type.  It’ll be beautiful team basketball vs beautiful team basketball.  Hawks in 6 to both the Bucks and the Suns
Tre went "bbq 🍗 alert" tonight
*Young really imitating curry with those gestures!😆😂😁*
Why the hell giannis didnt miss that freethrow and follow it up with a dunk or put back layup is beyond me
Mvp is young all the way hes on steph curry level strait shooter
5:08 Am I The Only One Dat Peeped🤣🤣🤣
*Trey Yung always misses 50-60% of his shots per game !😔*
Trae Young is a dumbfuk
Bucks in 6
Trae>Luca
Khris Middleton carries the bucks to an ultimate game tonight: 6/23 FG 26.1%  0/9 3PT FG  0%  75% FT   Incredible by the bucks 2nd option
Trae really finna bring it home like how lebron did in Cleveland. Let's fucking go!!
1 vs world by trae young.... whay a clutch game
I knew Trae was gonna be good out of college but this is a bit different 🤔🤯
Houston rockets picking small ball with harden & westbrook and dropping capela was the a top 3 worst decision in franchise history
4:55 had me dying 😂
Y'all really tried to tell me ben simmons was better than trae LMAOOOOO
4:52 shimmy
Bro 4:08 ohh MY gOd some video game shit if ive ever seen it
4:51 I peed my pants in public
Thats the difference between the nets and atlanta.. they used ckint capela for the boards and screens...  the nets didnt use de andre instead use blake and kd for defence on gianis... too much offence but lack of defence, shows this in this game... well deserve win foe atl🙂
Y the Greek get continuation buckets and erbody in the league dnt
Go home giannis 😂
trae young's handle is so tight
Pat Connaughton is Atlanta's secret weapon.
Hope the Hawks win the series.  Bucks don't deserve it after the dirty play against Kyrie
So how many all stars vs how many all stars?
People were really saying the Hawks got fleeced in the Doncic-Young swap. Sure if you want to say Doncic is an overall "better" player then fine, but I don't think the Hawks are losing too much sleep over their decision. Trae is a bonafide superstar and has taken this underdog Hawks team to amazing heights, we'll see how far he can go
*Bucks in 6 !!!!!!🦌*
Steff (Stephen) Curry was Bad for Basketball.  Trae Young is even Badder... shooting 60-foot shots from the rim lol
Suns at Hawks na lang sana sa finals para maiba naman
Who says this will be a easy win for greek freak?
Hawks are going to the final. Bucks don't have the bench or the coaching. Coach Bud might've saved his job when Kyrie going down Game 4 and Harden playing hurt but Trae is about to end this man's career.
Trae is Nasty
4:51.. First team all defense!?
This is the first time I'm seeing jrue holiday have a hard time being in front of someone, ice trae is a bad man...
Why is everyone the best player in the world against the bucks....
Curry who?
1:14 could there be a more obvious travel? Cmon now. If you're gunna throw people out for utter bs, you better call stuff like this too
Should we bring out the brooms???
Young dont play d
TRAE is a super saiYOUNG
Luka is a superstar. Trae is a superstar.  Who won that trade? BOTH teams are looking stout with these players.
now a day NBA defense is a joke, how da heo an opponent would allow a great shooter to have time to relax before shooting a 3 lmao.  But Trae and Booker represent.  Kobe's students are in the motion.
Y’all talking about how Trae didn’t make the all star team but who gives af about that really? It don’t solidify a damn thing. Just a bunch of fans voting on popularity . Just like the mvp and all these other awards that were given out don’t mean shit. . Where’s your mvp and the runner up MVP?? Home. Where’s your six man and your defensive player of the year??? Home. Where’s the coach of the year?? Home. These awards and appearances don’t mean shit to a person that’s gonna work hard regardless. Salute to Trae. 🥶🙏🏽
4:08 WHAT??
trae…
lets go hawks beat the bucks ........
Bro the hawks may actually go to the fricking finals 😂😂😂😂😂
Yes he did reg🤣🤣😤
tray looking like curry in 2015
Its cold in here, ICE cold!
bucks 2021 nba champs
Congratulations ATL, MLK Ringing The Bell!!! Trae Young is Absolutely Stellar ⭐⭐💫⭐⭐,Clint La Cape Capela is HAWKISH!!! GREAT team confidence, composure, Bogdanovic, Collins Hurter, Gallinari, Big Time... NATE The Grate McMillan must be proud...!!! Sweet Lou Williams ⭐ Let's make this Dream come true!!!!
Bucks is very dirty played
Is this trae vs mil highlights?
Yea I've seen enough... Hawks in 6
Best highlights I've seen in a long time. Looked like an epic game. Trae Young is dirty good.
Major Upset!  Trae tried to tell us the TRUTH after the Hawks got McMillan... I'm all ears now.  Go ahead & knock off my ECF pick Milwaukee from the beginning of this year.  Go 'head!
That cross into the shimmy 3 was so wild.
Trae Young had a Kobe Mentality.
Trae making cuban wish he didnt trade for luka 🤣 but 48, 7, 11 in the conference finals? Damn. Long way to go in the series but he could become a superstar already if he leads them to the finals
HAWKS ARE SERIOUS
Trae literally Steph evil twin 😭😭
The Hawks or Suns would be the purest teams to win the Championship. Just straight up team basketball no super team bullshit..
I'm just glad it's the Hawks and Bucks in the ECF's and not the Nets and Sixers.  Oh, and I'm glad the Clippers are getting torched.  It's a great postseason.
maybe giannis should switch his jersey number to 45 because he's been shooting 34 points every game
Hahahahah..look Gianni's after freethrow trying to eat of here hand ...he forget to not shot the ball
4:50  "But Holiday is gonna find an answer for this man right here" Trae: Shimmy shimmy
Ice tway duh twoof
Ima curry fan but trae young is nice 🔥💯💯💯
ATL made the right decision to trade Luka
🔥
Trae will be rookie of the year and most improve player!💪
Khriss Middleton sucks a$$. shoots about 26%, 0 for 9 in 3's WTF The fkr keeps shooting when he just doesn't have it. No need to be like Bend Simmons but after 15 shots if is not your night pass it to someone who is actually making the shots.  Bucks keep loosing when he does this shit. (takes way too many shots and only makes 1/4 of them)
This Young man got that mamba mentality
Tucker and Capela TeamUp by James Harden.. no Finals Appearance. They lucky to trade them from bucks and hawks. Its 1st Finals Appearance on East Conference Finals and next will be NBA FINALS 1st Appearance.
Trae Young is goin crazy right now lol. But I'm still pulling for the Bucks. I really wanna see the Greek Freak get a ring
Trae been hoping this playoffs !!
Budenholzer should be handed worst coach of the year after literally destroying the center position for Bucks. They have Giannis and Lopez and still getting out rebounded by a huge number.
Good win by the hawks Dem boys playing great basketball
Pathetic Giannis always celebrating too early.. That's why you lose.. Congrats to Trae for his career high 48pts.. Keep it up Hawks..
Like trae or not he shinning at the moment!
It’s like i see Trae play like stephen curry
2 free throws to ice the game where have I seen this before 🤔
Trae 🥶🥶🥶🥶 put up 48 & 11 on the “best” defensive team in the East on THEIR court!!!
Yeeeaash. That boy showing out!!!
Looking forward phoenix vs atl in finals 👌👌
“BuCKs iN FiVe”
Those Trae Young midrange floaters
I think a lot of people just became hawks fans lol
WHO THINK GIANNIS GONE PULL A ZAZA MOVE PRETTY SOON IN THIS SERIES
Yea I’ve seen enough. Hawks in 6 😤
As a Sixers fan, This team is 4real! I hope u guys win it all!
Who needs LBJames when we can watch Trae Young
LETS GO TRAE
Ok game 1 hawk!!!
I'm sure everyone would be shock if the Hawks ended up being NBA Champions this year
I. Imgen. The. Sixers. Play. Against. The 76ers in. Nba. Playoffs.
Ngl I thought Trae was severely overrated and would never live up to the Steph Curry comparisons but he’s doing a pretty damn good job of it. I’m dining on this crow for you Mr. Young, kudos.
Ben Simmons dodged a free throw
MILLER WAS LIKE CAN THE HAWKS KEEP UP AND GET STOPS...... THEN GAME
As i've Said, hawks is flying high, Trae Young a new NBA superstar!!
Holiday ankles was gettin snatched! 😆🤣
Trae young is not waiting his turn
5:13 “He shoots the 3”  Even the commentators messing up because so many 3’s go up
Hawks are like the heat last year
Tre young is that man!!
why is everyone calling the ws of atl an upset? they be doing this the whole szn. put some respect smh
Trae Young& Devin Booker The 2 Coldest Young Nigga's In The League Right Now. I Guess Them Light Skins Bak Winning Again 😂😂😂
What if the Mavs didn't trade Trae Young to the Hawks for Luka... someone's scratching their head right now
Is brook lopez hurt? Didn't see any highlights...
SHIMMY ON DEM TRAE!!!  #ATLYO✊🏽  #BELIEVE🥰♥️💛♠️
Trae sealed the game when free throws count the most
10u31xr1
Nice pass Trae 🏀
4:07 NBA Street Vol.2
Ashtray with the smoke boy!
Trae Young got a new move the "Ice Shimmy" Ben Simmons version : Frozen
Yall disrespected Trae this year on a lot of levels (balling like a superstar, and he couldn't go to the Allstars??). And I love the way that this youngster is balling. He's humble & proud, basketball IQ is up there, and most of the time, he's the SMALLEST PLAYER on the court, but that don't matter, cause he has the BIGGEST HEART also!! Now give him his props and ⚘
I knew he was gonna win game 1, I really did expect that, but I know he's gonna get reverse sweep😔
If Stephen A calls Devin Booker the next Kobe, then what is Trae Young?
Young Team playing Big. 🔥🔥
That lob off the backboard was cold man!!!😳😳😳
Trae deserves a ring
Max contract is waiting
Yay!!!!  Go Hawks!!!
What a game by my Atlanta Hawks.   The intensity by John Collins dunking   basketball,Trae hitting shots, and Capela   scoring the bucket that gave their offense   lead made me want to scream. I will give   Jrue Holiday and Giannis their respect   though. These two guys together kept   the Bucks extremely close. I know people  like to bash Giannis for being a poor free   throw shooter but tonight I even noticed   this dude making at least 2 very late in   4th quarter. Not only did Antekumpo and Collins give the fans a slam dunk contest   in Game number 1 but the way both   players did it was spectacular.   Number of plays they made were ridiculously high. Last but not least  Ice Trae connected on clutch free  throws that wrapped up his 48 points.  What do you guys think of Jrue's left handed dunks?? If you ask me I enjoyed it.  Getting a victory on road is huge. (ATL)👏
that's my nigga trae trea!!
This year's playoffs are crazy
I don't see any comments from the Bucks fans!?🤷
“Bucks going to bully the hawks” yea okay
Can’t wait to see what Shannon & Skip have to say 😂
I'm thinking no Dante divancenzo perhaps but bucks beat Brooklyn shouldn't they mop hawks
The next Curry of the game
Go hawkssss! Stand up Atlanta we almost there!!😁🍾🎉
ICE COLD TRAE! 💪💪
Is Atlanta going to win this series I'm confused ???
young plays like s. curry !!! wow. strong heart
I find it crazy that a player that scores exclusively off of threes and floaters can be so dominant
This Game's Highlights are literally Trae Young vs Giannis
Officially a Trae Young fan.
Trae fucking young !! Ice cold 🥶
It looks like the Hawks trading Luka for Trae Young was the better move
I just peeped, Trae Young is literally everything Julian Newman dreams of being.
it’s the height man, they been brainwashing us for years “gotta be 6’3&up to be considered league bound” this dude is obviously hard to defend without drawing a foul. So he’s always on GO offensively.
@4:09 I'm just hoping boxscore marking that as an assist
Sports analyst: Trae too small against Bucks. Blah, Blah, Blah  Trae Floaters & 3 Pointers: You were saying... 👂🏾
If you told me a 6 foot skinny guard would score 48 points against a team with Giannis and Brook Lopez taking turns on help, I would've been asking you where the punchline to that joke is. But it's not a joke no more, this dude Ice Trae is sum special.
This year's been so bad and worse is happening. Hawks winning
New Curry in the building
@1:14 ?
Best 3 team on my list on top hawk suns ml. But Suns will rekt dem all
ice tray the truth
june 23 pa ang nakalagay samantalang jun 24 na
Luka and Young trade before was just a balance swapped
I dont think the bucks realize that whatever shot giannis takes, it has a 60% chance of going in, including freethrows, just let the damn man play down the stretch.  Its not choking, its consistency
I saw Trae shooting 30 footers with both hands tied behind his back.... he’s like the basketball Chuck Norris
John Collins is just 23 😳  His pops is Navy, moms Air Force. He moved and lived all over the world growing up.  Huge footie fan, his club is Chelsea, from playing soccer on every military base with kids in Turkey, Guam, Virgin Islands, Germany.  Rooting for the Hawks because of this dude! Such a good head on his shoulders! $CLOV
Hawks ??
This really one of the best playoffs rn just cuz there’s no super stacked teams just a whole bunch of good basketball
That boi has ICE in his veins.... and dats why they call him IceTrae 🤣
Hawks in 5.. Bucks cant beat a healthy team unless Giannis injures Trae somehow lol.. Good Luck
Congratulations Hawks👏🏾
That alley oop was fukn legendary
Pat Connaughton was wide open and air-balled it. That must sting.
This video is filled with ads
My nets are knocked out, but geez the playoffs this year are mad fun to watch.
Ice Trae 🥶
tucker and holiday is dancing
just wow for hawks talking game one from bucks
Others: kill and recall celebration.  Trae young: spam recall first before killing 😂🤣🤣🤣
Giannis is a more upgraded version of Ben Simmons
I might catch alot of hate for saying this but.. maybe the Mavs should have kept Trey👀🏀
Capela and Trae best combo
I want to trae square up against booker in the finals
The NBA is way more entertaining w.o LeFlop James in the playoffs
Curry: Shimmy after the ball went in.  Trae young: Shimmy first before shooting the ball 🤣😂😂  Like wtf? Hahahah I'm dead hahaha
Collins after the three point shot Collins:shut your mouth bench homies
Dear Hawks ownership: Please do not mess this up... RE-SIGN HIM.  Sincerely, Hawks Fans
wooo, trae young
See even Giannis makes his fkin free trows when he needs it
He play like the 15-18 curry🔥
The one young player the media fails to hype and he the one left making moves in the ECF. Just goes to show how much these so called analyst really know. Now they all "wagonist"...
Hawks in game 7💯
I hope the HAWKS win against the BUCKS!! Trae Young is the VILLIAN!!
it’s a bird, it’s a plane, no it’s Trae Young
Soon for the buck to go homeeee
It's crazy the more I watch Trae Young play, the more I see that he's like James Harden.
Lopez played terrible defense on the ball screens. Hes too slow. They need to play giannis at C and go small
Trae rookie Prizm fixing to skyrocket!!!
Hawks the 20 Heat
Young over luka 😂
Young in 8k is iconic
Wow tree Young 😍😍
Trae know how to controls bucks offence . .  Bucks win against nets has a asterisk .. It's a win with lots of what if.
TRAE YOUNGs power level? OVER 9000!!!
Grate defense acapela to gianniss
Well excuse me KD, i mean Trae Young
Hawks in 5
As a Miami fan, these Hawks have had my respect. I've loved our matchups in the regular. These boys just now finding out how cold Ice can be. Best of wishes to y'all, going forward.
Yeah not suprised Bucks barely put up any 3s if they continue like that they're gonna lose the series 🤦‍♂️
Reggie Miller: "An absolute Superstar. You can put Super in front of his Name now" 💯
If I had to take something away I’ll take away the floaters and lobs. He would just have to kill me from three. I know he capable of doing that but it’s a low percentage shot. If he mak 10 a game all series then I’ll just shake his hand tell him good game. I’ll go under the screen ever time. Every time
Last two time outs of bucks nothing happened.  Giannis and holiday 1st defensive all team let trae scores 48.
Wow crazy performance from Trae young 🔥🔥🔥
PG gotta take notes on late game free throws
I hope it's hawks and suns in final because dam Trae and booker have been getting whatever they want in the post season so far it would be a fun match up
NBA playoffs and finals are rigged by the Illuminati . From fake injuries to players losing on purpose ⏳
Can I say holy fucking shit? Cause holy fucking shit that was tuff.
Basketball analyst on youtube better delete that "trae young is a Bust" thing. Exactly what Trae said "Let my WORK do the talk"
If greek freak can hit those two free throws late , then Ben simmons has no excuse
Bucks suck in the second half lololol GO HAWKS
trey killing it with that floater/lob threat
Hawks vs suns
Luka is special but so is #IceTre! These two will forever be linked.
2:19 I love how there's no way they can describe this play, just "oh my goodness" and "nice handle" lmao
“Are the Bucks finished?”  First Take tomorrow prolly
Jrue has to prove that he can defend at a high level (tho team defense should be). He has a chance against a transcendent talent like Trae. Simmons (who claimed) to be the best defender in the NBA failed, of course we knew what happened against the Knicks. Holiday is the last guy in the EAST to melt the Iceeeeee trae. would be interesting to see the next few games. by the way, Bogdan must be a visionary to have chosen Hawks over the Bucks.
As a loyal but long suffering Hawks fan it feels good to have a young and fearless team representing your city.......
When was the last time a five seed made the NBA finals?
On some real shit. Giannis stepped on the line and hit two clutch shots. And y’all acting like that ain’t even happen. Y’all haters fr!!! It’s one game. Y’all was just talking abt him, and after one game y’all already hating. Let them do some adjustments
y’all forgetting my man capella he was on fire 😜
I'm not even gonna bring up the shanghai sharks this time because that connaughton guy aint makin the roster
Marv alberts age is showing and it’s sad to see😔
Giannis ne dunking all the ball. Basketball is not all about dunking. He needs to jump shoot, shoot mid range and 3s too. He is limited. Only advantage he's using os height. Other than height he's not an extraordinary ball player
I swear most analysts said that Trae Young was/is overhyped... Now those same analysts are praising him such hypocrites in sports analysis.
Curry's monster found a successor
The Bucks vs Trae young
It's fun watching this Atlanta team. All aboard the hype train!
better to see Booker vs. Young in the finals
I’m not going lie that was a hall of a game
If hawks win the finals Trae Young is a hall of famer.
5:10 this is the reason why Marv Albert is retiring hahahaha
And Ben Simmons getting picked as an Allstar Over Trae Young. 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
that's why bensimmons is star iln trae is not .they can't even see that ben has embiid n young has trae.😜😝🤪😛
Ice Trae all the waaaaay! haaawks!
😂 yall saying bucks will beat the suns when they even have a hard time fighting the hawks
Hawks put on a show 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 very entertaining game . Now we gotta put some respekt on trae young’s name . And give the hawks the respect they deserve
Trae different hawks to the finals 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Reggie Miller loves Trae Young
Trae young is a beast
Down South boys Love being Nobody its called Motivation, Bucks coach stupid post Giannis up he controls the Paint more rebounds and less energy point guard seriously.
Be careful tae the bucks like to go injury niggas like you to when the series then make it seem like the earn the win
trae young is carrying the Hawks like KD did last series
This is the best chance giannis had since 2019. I swear to god if he lose to fucking trae young. The analyst will crucify this man. He might as well become a Paul George and a kyrie, super talented, enough to be running their own team but doesn’t the mindset so they settle for less
Now I realize how Miami Heat made a run last year. Philly and Bucks who look very good on paper and in regular season are sh** in playoffs. Seeing 2 times MVP Giannis play is serious disappointment. Hawks played well but common man Bucks are literally underperforming the entire playoffs.
DUA LIPA .
As a Knicks fan. Fuck Trae Young but you gotta respect his game
I believe in Trae Young's Supremacy 👌🔥
I'M LEVITATING !!!!
🅰️ message to the Western conference, this is how you ice free throws at the end of the game when it's crucial, if you know what I mean❗🏀🏆
Clint Capela said Trae Young is better than James Harden
Collins have underrated hops. 😎
The Bucks interior defense will have pick-and-roll nightmares tonight!  T Young was way too comfortable all game.  I might not know what to do to stop it, but I know that dropping back 15 feet from a shooter like Trae during every pick-and-roll or screen is NOT the answer.  They better hope is has a bad shooting night next game.
I had the stank face the whole video. Treeeey young!  Balling
Does NBA take a new ball in every match ??
Yesssss!!!!!! bucks  you will looseeeeee
Trae over luka 👀
Trae young a menace
Deym trae
Now can somebody agree with me that the hawks won the trade , Trae young is better than Luka....prove me wrong ....I'll wait.....🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣......Luka can't make it out the 1at round 😳......Trae young has faced more adversity than Luka and with a lesser team , and has beaten the odds 🤔.....im taking Trae all day ......
Go Hawks ! Avenge my Nets 😆✌️
and i wonder why people hate him...
People doubted Trae when he came out of Oklahoma and said it wouldn't work in the NBA... 😂
I will be telling my future kids the story of playoff Trae
Young having the best post season run out of everyone. Happy for him
4:08 Trae and JC out here playing NBA Street with the Bucks!!
This is why I do not watch today's nba. It is an abomination to how the game is supposed to be played. The bucks couldn't get a defensive board up 7 with four minutes left in the game all the momentum in the world at home and can't get a freaking defensive rebound after trey young missed deep 3 after deep  3. Ths was such a regular season effort by the bucks. They do not deserve this stage. And on the shot where bogdonavich air balled the wide open 3 down 3 with seconds left can someone explain to me why he was shooting the ball 10 ft behind the 3 point line and he is WIDE tf open. He could have cut to the basket and maybe gotten a layup or just moved in closer to the 3 point line but he had no excuse for being that deep as if their is 4 point line. The bucks didn't want to win tonight trey young went off but was definitely held in check in the 4th quarter and the bucks lost the game simply because they couldn't get rebound with 4mins left in the game
wtf, giannis is more clutched in free-throw than pg? lol
This year status  Lebron, tatum, leonard, durant, luka, curry, irving, lillard < trae
This is your "NEW" NBA CHAMPIONS🏆ATL❤💥
Trae been a murder y’all NicGa’z just don’t wacth basketball
how you gonna get crossed by gallinari but lockdown kd
Yo how u let one player score 48 points
Game 1, Atlanta beats the Bucks AT home. JESUS.
Thats floater is in hall of fame
Yo who low key wants the hawks to win the championship Ik I do
Bron fans became Suns fans, and Nets fans became Hawks fans all of a sudden. 😁🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 watch out for bandwagons everyone. Lmao
Giannis's moving screens in the 4th were so obvious. Then I remembered that the rules are different for Superstars in the playoffs
how can gallinari lose tucker like that?
Young>Harden If young was on the Nets then the kid would have 5 rings
Luka 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫
Ummm, Bucks, y'all have some explaining to do! But seriously, the Hawks are for real, and Trae Young is a budding superstar. Take notes Ben Simmons.
TrAe YoUnG bETteR tHaN cUrRy🤡🤡
How dangerous u can be when you have nothing to lose
Giannis choke again miami now hawks
Suns would wipe the floor with either one of these teams.
why the fuck are we bout to get hawks in the NBA finals? who would've even predicted that to happen? I know its just game 1 but goddamn I thought bucks would destroy hawks
Trae Young. Damn homie. U definitely him
PUT SOME RESPECT ON NATE MCMILLANS NAME !! If this was a "white coach"  we'd be hearing about how his X's & O's is putting the team in a position to win.....EVEN "BLACK" analyst are brainwashed & not giving "black" coaches their proper respect on live TV ! They too are caught up in the player hype and not how the coaching is puttin the players in positions to win !!!!!!!!!!
nah 4-2 bucks win
They beat the nets😂
Bogdonavich sucks
Trae Young has been spectacular to watch in the Playoffs. He's definitely solidifying himself as a force to be reckoned with in the NBA for years to come, even if he loses in the Playoffs.
04:08 damn
Y'all let him shimmy 😂
Phoenix and Atlanta got straight up hoopers on their team.🔥🔥🔥both teams can play offense and defense kudos to them
Trae the killer
fun fact: this the bucks first home loss this playoffs
I’ve just realized I’ve been correct for every prediction of the conference finals both conferences I’ve said the hawks win in a close one tonight and I said the suns win with less than a ten point lead in both games
Anybody thinking the refs are helping Trae Young or that a rule change next season is going to slow him down does not know basketball. The way he manipulates defenses is next level. Really the foundation of Trae's game is IQ, court vision, and ball handling/ball skills. Phenomenal game tonight. Official superstar level has been unlocked.
Give Trae his props! ATL in 6! I said it.
Put Trae over Luca
Is very obvious and expected  NBA game Final is between  HAWKs and SUN
Imagine the hawks going to the finals without an "allstar"..
New 2k animations otw
Trae is a guaranteed menace to society after that shimmy on jrue 🤣🤣
Giannis trying  to do his zaza thing on trae same he did on kyrie . The hawks will beat the bucks in 5
No one gave the hawks a chance and they took care of business like they were supposed to..
If kris middleton heats up its over bucks in 6
They needed 48points from trae young only to beat the bucks by 3 if inconsistent Middletown just has 20 points the bucks win
Nice one trae young
Man not too long ago Trae was chucking up deep airball 3s with a weird toss-up style, I remember reading an article that John Collins didn't believe Trae could lead the Hawks with his playstyle. Now, this dude's shot selection is top tier and he's hitting pure net, he's coming for everything everyone said he couldn't have. let's all put some damn respect on this man's name.
The 76ers would of lost this game though 🤣
I hate seeing these guys score crazy points on these so called “defenders”
If they keep the core of this team together they going to be here for a couple years golden state of the east steph curry of the east think about it
john collins just don't get enough of murdering his opponents 😭🥶
Booker is taking that 🏆
trae imitating curry
Trae Young superstar performance.  ATL best surprise this post-season.  Cheering them on rest of the way.
Trae young was stephesque maybe even better he’s a top 5 point guard
Bucks fault. Just let the Hawks hang in there & Trae shoots way to good for that dumb 💩
Coach bud you know you're still on the hot seat right continue to make dumb mistakes like you made tonight you won't be back next year  Bobby portis only play 14 minutes don't know why you don't like Bobby portis can't understand This is the conference finals Pat C had a game tying 3  pointer  are you kidding me
I remember some time back in the news reported Kobe's daughter Gianna's favorite player in the NBA was Trae Young. I always wondered why. Now I know. RIP to both.
Trae young is the only right decision Atlanta has ever made
Trae Young so disrespectful😂😂 After he crossed Jrue or however you spell his name, he gave em a lil shoulder shimmy before hitting the 3😭
"Charles Barkley left the group"
The Hawks earned my respect awhile ago but tonight I was wowed by their fortitude. The Greek freak was having no problem scoring and yet they still managed to win. That’s not easy.
Trae looks like steph out there forreal
🦅🦅🦅ATLANTA HAWKS NBA FINALS 2021!!!!!!
And the Hawks are playing without Reddish and Hunter smh
Ice tray
Capela has a chance for a championship..  James Harden  . maybe next year
I pick HAWKS FOR THE EAST FINALS, Clippers for champion!
Simply amazing....Trae young is a fucking  savage 💪💯😎😎
Trae young think he good until giannis dunks on him
Suns v Hawks would be a great Finals if both teams can pull it off
All star this year In - Ben Simmons Out - trae young  Really dawg?
Yo, Trae Young is very disrespectful!! and i love it!
Ben Simmons woulda missed those free throws 😅
The hawks got the A rocking rn
TY TY: Thank You Trae Young The Youth That Yells This Young SUPERSTAR.
I used to hate Trae Young. He showed some cajones this year. Respek.   Media tries to paint him as a villain, just like Ben Simmons is a superstar. Puhleeeze. I hope this hawks team meets the suns in the finals. Thats gonna be some amazing basketball.
the hawks have been the lower seed in every series they played.and now they’re in the conference final
Trae Young is a fucking beast, holy shit...  Looking like an absolute baller out there.  4/4 clutch free throws.  Damn, we got a new superstar in the making.
WTF is they doing with 27.3 seconds left and 21 seconds on the clock. Run the clock down and get the ball to Giannis or Khris. This dummy takes a 3 point shot which cost us the game.
What a game
Trae young is an evil Steve Nash.
trae young is a bad man
Who knew Capela had so much left
I still got the Bucks. But going off this game, this is going to be a longer series than expected.
4:52 y'all is it getting cold In here
Trae Young has got ice water flowing through his veins.
Who ever wins game 2 got the whole series!
Ice trae baby.  Let's go hawks
Middleton trash again 15pts 0-9 from 3pt
NBA officially a joke if this little nigga wins the championship
This is what happend in the first game vs the nets they lost first game and came back to get the W its gonna be the same with this series
Atlanta Hawks are starting to remind me of a young Golden State team (2014-15 season) when they won their first championship as a core.
Whoever decides to play defense will win this series.
Trae young sunod na curry. Nd malabo
Shoutout to the stars that stayed with a small market team and are now reaping the benefits. They didn’t whine or complain when the team stunk it up every night. They didn’t ask to go team up with there buddies or threaten the organization about leaving, they just kept grinding: Trey Young and Devin Booker.
Trae swag 😎
Lets sweep the foolish Giannis
They better on the road. Please agree with me im listening! Atl!
4:51 wow
Anyone else wonder why Giannis didn't miss the second free throw on purpose to just race and grab the rebound?  I mean would that have worked?  😝
I can’t distinguish the trolls from the fans in this comment section. I’m rooting for the Bucks but Im definitely fine with the hawks taking it, just don’t want Skip be right and having to listen to him brag for a week.Trae definitely earned this one tho💯
Hawks better hope the Bucks have an off night again lol
Still aint over you need to win 4 to advance..thats the way this years playoffs goes..2-0 still not safe every team can comeback wtf...
They won't snub Trae Young ever again for the All Star game.
Go Super Trae Young!
The Suns can play well with both of these teams I don't care who wins the series
That fuckin oop off the backboard my gawd
Aight hawks in 4
"Its quiet as fuck in here."  ~Trae Young 2021
Trae is better than Luka carnage my mind
The New Era is taking over!
Now the nba knows who is the real deal
Trae young can not be allowed open in the 3 point area he is great shooter.
Now everyone knows what that boy can do. remember when he was hated by the whole world and now everyone is talking about him and people slept on trey and atl for trading luka to mavs and they see that this was the right decision and even booker too now the nba knows who are the real deal
Cant wait for a book and trae shoot out come NBA Finals
Trae Young is the new Reggie Miller
Definitely some fresh blood for the playoffs it's going to be interesting to see who comes out of the East and the West! If Chris Paul can't play like Chris Paul Phoenix may not make it!
Knicks fan here... pulling for the Hawks. They are playing some out of this world ball.
PG13 should learn from Trae Young on how to shoot free throw perfectly
I know why Trae is not an All Star because he is an All Super Star and there's no such thing in the NBA right now.
Young needs to stop shooting far away from the 3 point line. He rarely make those. He needs to get a little closer. That's how Bucks to the 7 point lead late in the 4th quarter. If he can just stop that and get a little closer. He'll be more dangerous.
Imagine having Ben Simmons in allstars but not Trae Young 😂💀
You know PG 13% sold when Giannis hit both free throws 🤦🏾‍♂️
STOP PLAYING WIT TRAE,MAN  OUT HEAR  THROWING  PASSES OFF BACKBOARD  THEN CROSSING N HITTIN NIGGAZ WIT THE  SHIMMY, HE DIFFERENT
Bro the nbas new camera for after the game are so clear it’s unbelievable
Panis ang buks😂
I felt like Atlanta was going to win game one I had a feeling it would be close and It definitely was! Atlanta has a lot of weapons!
If they could only play D
trae young is the next steph curry
Luka who?
Luka who?
Why does tway do what Steph does everytime he makes a shot? 😑
4:52 No he Didn't 😂
Trae Young wow 🔥
Trae > Luka
Letttts GOooooo ( da baby voice )
Imagine buck fans thinking that they actually have a chance to win the series...
From Ice Trae to Super Ice Trae   ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Young’s post season is starting to feel like 2006 wade or 2018 kawahi it feels like he could take them all the way
4:08 jeeeezzz whatta play
Hawks in 6. Iceman cometh.
I remember Capela dominating the inside in Houston and suddenly he gets traded. Keep on shining man.
LeGoat taking his talents to Atlanta!
🥶🥶🥶
The fact that Trae was not an all star this season, he's proving the haters and doubters wrong with his consistency in the playoffs
Batang banog nagbangis, "usa" (bucks) lukapa!
Shake the shoulder: the Ice Move    🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶
They said bucks in 4.
Trae is kinda like A.I. kiling these giants
Trae Young is a tremendous superstar in this game! Well done kid! 👍👍
Trae is amazingly taking the floor over at the point...truly the leader needed
The hawks are proving the whole nba fans wrong😂 what happened to the sixers in 4, bucks in 4?
Recency bias is really a drug for these trolls 😂 trae young been playing good but let’s not act like he’s top 10 today already 😂
Let’s go hawks!!!
I was loving Trae until he did a Broner.
Pj Tucker was out there doing the cha cha cha on defense 😂
The hawks have shown that they can win, and I mean win it all because trae young is a leader and possess the uncanny ability to close on a big stage. They are put together like golden state and the spurs perfect blend and they aren't full strength scary lol
Ice tray is a beast!! Props ma brotha
Before game GUARANTEE!!!!! After game ,Charles Barkley - 😶
Hawks underrated
Trae young vicious
Go Atlanta 🔥✊
Ano milwauke lol hahahahaha!!
If Ben Simmons has Trae’s skillset and mindset🤣🤣
Steph 2.0..........
Giannis should teach PG how to hit free throws down the stretch.
Trae Young's game is 50% James Harden and 50% Steph Curry... the guy's a beast !!!!!!
Bruh. We gotta start talking about the potential for the hawks to win it all.
god giannis' 1v1 game is so frustrating to watch
Give Gallo a 💍.   *Gallo come back to Denver BB*
Trae Young is Ice Cold! 🧊🧊
*Dudes name should Terrible Trae because he is an absolute Terror this season!*
Holi - dayy!💥
KD prob looking at ATL like hmmmm 🤔
Ian never seen some like this Trae cold fr 🙅
Tae ang tamad mag bantay ng hawks okitnana
That man trae young is deadly!!!!
Sports analysis  gone respect trea
I keep telling people do not be so quick to give this series to the Bucks.. Trey Young supporting cast is better than a KD team minus Kyrie and a hurt Harden.
This whole game was a highlight reel
*🤔 I remember Dominique Wilkins, Doc Rivers, Reggie Theus, Spud Webb, Kevin Willis and still the Atlanta Hawks weren't as good as this team right here. WTF🤷🏿‍♂️🙆🏿‍♂️*
Incredible trae 🔥🔥
Young, Booker, Mitchell, Zion…Could imaging how amazing the league will be like in the next few years.
The East has a new King
Title needs correction-Hawks at Bucks....Trae Young Highlights.
comments not necessary at this point of time. .wait 'til who wins the first 4. .
8:16 21 seconds shot clock, down by only 1. then shoots a fking 3.... n i c e
Charles Barkley: Bucks in foooow
Budenholzer must be a substance abuser in his spare time..because no damn way you drew up that play for *Pat Connaughton*
4:51 Jrue need a map
Trae Young been a Super Star ⭐
🤣😂🤣😂
Playoff yips are real
4:51 the moment everyone is talking about
These ads are so fucking annoying
John Collins can ball 💪🏽
Trae has mastered the PG position already. Almost no one can stay in front of him because of his handle and speed. If you sag off he will murder you from long range, if you play tight he will beat off the dribble, if the lane is full he will stop and pop and hit the floater, if there is a big in the lane he will draw and extra defender and kick it out.. there is almost nothing you can do to with him defensively
Mike Budenholzer better turn this around if he wants to keep his job bc if he loses the Nets series win won’t matter and he still end up being unemployed
This is turning out to be more and more interesting: After Hawks 'broke' his leg and made sure to knock out King James as competitor in the West, they are now seeking to capitalize and grab the Chip that is really 'up for grabs'.
Marv Albert has gone senile omg
Lets go ATL....ball out
When somebody takes a shot, I can’t help but think of Ben Simmons.
Giannis favorite score is 34 😂😂
Soloman hill at the end😂
Here for the “Bucks in 4” idiots. PLEASE KEEP SLEEPING ON ATL. Thank you.
This hawks team is absolutely resilient always sticking around and doing what needs to be done Bravo Well done well earned Congrats Young @Hawks
Trey Triple H Young is a cerebral assassin
Giannias is not a pro!!!   Jason Tatum would have miss the free throw intentionally & got & easy2 for OT.
2:22 4:52 look at my son with the smooth moves
THE MILWAUKEE BUCKS ARE PRETENDERS NOT CONTENDERS
Its impressive to see how far a team w/o actual super stars do so well this far.. REMINISCENT OF THEM 04 PISTONS 👏👏
Good gawd who thought it was a good idea to hire Reggie??  Only person more annoying is his sister
No one lost in that Trae Young vs Luka trade
What the hell is Reggie Miller talking about, how is Trae Young a super star? The media and retired NBA players are so quick to call these guys super stars, and they haven't won shit yet! They was calling Ben Simmons a super star not to long ago also. 👀😑
Watch out  this season is ful of upset
Istg if the hawks had better defense it wouldn’t have been such a close game
Suns vs Hawks finals???
Heck yeah!  This is awesome!
5:10 Shoots the 3 you say? Lol
If Bucks wants to win this series they shouldn't give Connaughton any  goddamn minutes
The road to the NBA Finals doesn't go through Milwaukee or Atlanta--it goes through Trae Young. If you can't stop that boy then you don't deserve to go...period!
Trae Young 48 and 11, John Collins 23 and 15, Clint Capela with 19 boards. WOW. Go Hawks!
Win a Chip & then you can talk Zero Fucken Banners with one decent season, yet you demand respect. Atlanta's drooling for some accolades.  Fucken Trash Organization......why they're not? Lmfao
Mice trae fluking its way.
That's what the Hawks do. Learned that as a Sixers fan.
Trae said the series will be fun but nah he's just having fun shimmying and crossovers SHEESH
I’ll take Trae over luka any day this man trae is cold blooded
Look at how confident and comfortable this Hawks team specially Trae Young. They definitely deserve to win not just this game but also this series if they continue to perform like this.
THE ATLANTA HAWKS HAVE THE HOME COURT ADVANTAGE NOW!!!!!!
Should the Mavericks be salty if trae wins a ring this year?
Trae is really making a real name for himself this playoffs. If you didn't know how good he was before now you do.
BULLSHIT damn u ATL damn u 👿👎🏀
Bucks in 4 hahahah y’all look so dumb rn
*Not Icey Trae having Holiday on SKATES*
Pacers hating themselves for firing Nate 😂
Trae Young's playing style Reminds me of Steph Curry
Whattttt! You never know who gone win but I can't wait to hear what the media has to say about this.
Did this man trae shimmy in the middle of a conference finals game😨
Laker Fan In The House: "It's Only The First Game So Let's See Who Wants It More."
DeAndre Ayton v Clint Capela 2021 NBA FINALS!🔥🔥🔥
Unbelievable Trae Young! You carried the team all the way to the playoffs.
ICE ICE BABY!
6ixers fans don't feel as bad as they did now I bet.
4:08 straight outta 2K
5:11 "shoots the three..." No. No he did not.
Watching Giannis take a freethrow is like watching Lord of the Rings trilogy, it takes forever.
I guess the mavs is hurting after choosing Luka over Trae young. Just opinion at all.
Guess Harden isn't the only the player to be happy they left Houston.
Knicks fans should feel better now I guess. Lol
I think were watching rokie lebron hahahaha jk..
When’s it gonna stop being an upset…atl in fo
Im not rooting for either team but if the bucks wanna win, post up on Trae and tire him out , the only way any team will slow him down...is that so hard? Both Milwaukee guards are bigger than him, why not?
Trae playing like he been in the playoffs before!!!
Hawks make the finals hawks are winning it all
That's my mf hawks!
So now im so curious who really won the lottery pick between LUKA & TRAE??  Help me with this im confused🙁🧐
young, curry 2.0?
I just want bucks fans to know they have a dominant team built for the regular season, they are scrubs in the postseason and it might be time to trade Giannis before he realizes he is better off elsewhere and walks
1st seed loses to 4th seed rip sixers but never nets
We have Giannis Attackurankle here in the building tonight
This is amazing....how far will Hawks reach in this madness season...
Huh wlang kba
ICE TRAE!!!!
As a bucks fan they got to comfortable and paid the price, the hawks are no joke
4:08-4:12 had me wildin yo‼️🔥
Nate McMillan coached rings around Knicks (Tom Thibodeau) and Sixers (Doc Rivers.) Will the Bucks be the next victim?  Maybe so because the Bucks have not been winning because of Mike Budenholzer. They have been winning despite him.   If the Bucks had a competent head coach they could have beaten the Nets in 5 or 6 games. The Nets were playing without Kyrie and with Harden on one leg and still came within an inch of KD's sneaker of beating the Bucks in Game 7.  All because of Budenholzer.  So don't be surprised if the Hawks win this series too. The Hawks ownership better put some respect on Nate McMillan's name,  remove the "interim" tag and pay the brotha.  He damn sure deserves it.
28 - 3 with 8:31 Remaining 3rdQ
THE MILWAUKEE BUCKS GOT PUNKED!!!! GO HAWKS
Yoo, this nigga Trae too disrespectful 😂🤣🤣
It’s good to see a baller making both free throws
Oh dear the Hawks are soaring pass the bucks rn  🦅                                            🦌
Trae Young is making his path to the top of the league. Mamba mentality, focus and smart.
John Collins is sooooo slept on, he's very underrated
magchampion cguro tong altlantha.
Very nice!!! 👌👌👌👍👍👍
Trae was on fire.  Great game for him. That assist to Collins off the backboard was sick.
Hawks are literally disrespecting this bucks team and i like it 😈😈😈
Mannn the hawks is oozing with confidence. The pressure is all on the bucks. The hawks already exceeded expectations, they're enjoying the moment
Suns vs Hawks finals, a couple years ago we would have laughed at this
Dallas biggest trade of luka and trae!
Tray looking like a young AI🙌🙌🙌🙌🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Hawks finna win it all! 😤😤
Meanwhile Ben Cinammons: 👁👄👁
I pick the Suns and the Hawks to make it to the Finals.
Trea showing pandemic P how to shoot free throws in the clutch
Mark my words. Trae is going to have a better career than Steph.
the ice cold shimmy @ 4:54
Trae can score with the best of them and I’m seeing the killer instinct with him.
Im telling you, after Kendall is done with Booker, she will move to another light skinned brotha Trae Young
Lol all the people that said fuck Trae Young punching the air right now. Young fella is the truth
Weird series here. The Atlanta Hawks use to play in MILWAUKEE & the current BUCKS coach used to coach the Hawks!!!! hmmmmm.
The bucks are gonna beat any drum any way. This us just a warm up match.
Atlanta Vs Suns in final
Atlanta has been the dark horse team in these playoffs
I keep expecting the Hawks to look like an Atlanta sports team, but somehow they're still winning
Very nice!! T. Young and D. Book is making a new era of superstars. Make it both of you to the finals!
Is it an upset if everyone #Believe$???
Trae..wow!!! Congrats! atlanta hawks!!👏👏👏
Do the Bucks break their team up if they lose this series?Let's debate and also Middleton mad inconsistent
Wow nice T Y
Trae Young just showed Pandemic P how to close out a game.
Paul George left the conversation.
Vindication for not getting ROY.
I'd be a lot happier with a belly full of mead.
Wyt I thought it was GSW not Atlanta 👀
June Trae 😈
Trae is consistently playing great !!!
4:05 Repeat button for one of the dirtiest oops I’ve seen in game
I am disappointed with bucks  respect to trae😍😍.
5:07 SHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESHHHHHH
Battle of the champs..ahh long time ago
Ice Trae
I can't believe Con missed that shot THAT badly.
The Mavs punching in the air right now😂
4:50 😲
Trae making reggie proud
These youngsters Trae, Devin, Mitchell Perfoming at the highest level... I guess they are being watched by veterans like LBJ and KD.
Anybody say Trae Young aint the Truth. They a liar.👍
Where is Lopez? WTF Bucks lol.
The racial permission observationally suggest because mayonnaise biologically screw vice a fancy propane. barbarous, hospitable fahrenheit
Trae got snub in allstar and allnba Trae: ok fine let them get that imma get this
Trae is making a statement in this playoffs and personally I’m impressed with his play.
Hawks still will not get credit for this one. I'm pretty sure they will say it's Khris Middleton's fault. All the "experts" will say he could have least scored 19 instead of 15. 😑 That would have given them the win. Such Genius!!
Excited to see if ATL can do it like what Heat did last year or even better. 5th seed to be in the NBA Finals. Need to overcome the Bucks and the winner of Suns-Clippers series. Great job coach Nate, Trae, John and team
What the...hawk!
Trae Young is the truth . Def my favorite of the new elite players
Trae Young has been on fire all this post season. Hopefully Hawks vs Suns for the NBA finals. Booker vs Young would be an epic match to watch.
Ok That Luka trade looking better n better everyday
Post up play gets no love from the refs nowadays but you sneeze at a jump shooter they call fouls.
Suns Vs Hawks 💪
Trae was balling 🏀 he haven’t had one game like this on the sixers other than game 1
ICE TRAEEEE DA GANGGGGG
story of a villain!!
Superstar has born. Another playoff career 48pts and a historic performance by Trae Young
Trae Young>>>>>>>. Luka
I dont think hawks will win on this series
JRUE Holiday underrated ⭐️
This playoff season has been so weird its insane
You know steph about to start shimmying before he shoot 😂
Loveeee ittt !!! 🤪🤪
ATL Underhawk darkhawk 🦅🦅🐎🐎
Hawks think they are gonna beat the Bucks😁😂
Trae Young Supremacy
Middleton choke this game
I never did imagined hawks will make it this far Gotta give them the respect And that shimmy's i like that
#BelieveAtlanta
Atlanta Hawks .....
phx and atl in the finals, what a time to be alive
1:40 ayo trae pointing up like my guy curry
He looks way better than curry, doing the shimmy
Trae Young 🥶🥶🥶
im Cheering For Buck but Trae went nutty
When Trae said "Bucks series is gonna be fun", I didnt expect it to be this fun. He really meant it.
Hayop
Chanting fck Trae Young is a curse 🤣🤣
🌞 Suns vs Hwaks 🦅
Trae Young says: That's how you shoot free throws with the game on the line (4.6 seconds in the 4th qtr)
One game and so hyped up😂😂
Hawks is a team that has nothing to proved. Bucks on the other hand have to prove something or else it's their third straight year not getting into the Finals.
The hawks on that a**!!!
Middleton nowhere to be found
Trae look like a beast from H
Khris Middleton was 0-8 from three before that last missed three. Jrue or Forbes should've taken the shot
Trae Young should of took Ben Simmons spot for the All Star game
Trae Young is nice man. Love his game.
Idk what else the Hawks need to do to gain the respect the other 3 teams have. This is their 3 game 1 road win in a row. They continue to show that they can be physical with anyone regardless of the opposing team's defensive prowess that apparently puts their opponent above them. The media just needs to accept that this Hawks team is legit and they came to play!
Can we talk about it would of went to overtime if that guy made the three flight gonna go crazy on him lmao
I am getting increasingly annoyed by Trey bricking those unnecessary deep 3s.
Three games out of four where the Bucks give up at least 48 points to a player. Where's the defense?
76ers fan here. I'm rooting for ATL all the way. Young is a monster and I really want him to win a championship! Good luck Hawks!
The off the back alley to Collins ! Put some respect on Trae ! The confidence the hawks are playing with is unmatched.   Hawks vs Suns would be crazy.
The scariest opponent is the one who plays like they have absolutely nothing to lose. Hawks have been playing with house money this whole time 🔥🔥🔥
Fitting that I get an ad for balding prevention while watching Trae young cook the bucks
Once again Pat Conaughton comes up big...for the opposing team.
Let’s go Hawks
Trae Been abusing that pick in roll gambit all season lol
Remember when peoeple said "bUcKs iN 4"
i bet lefraud wishes he was as good as trae young
"Ice Trae"
Beautiful game of basketball. I hope everyone stays healthy.
NBA community can we take a moment to acknowledge that Brooklyn put together this super ass team and got knocked off in 2 round in the east 😭😭😭
Bucks is champion
I’m really hoping for a Suns Hawks finals, 2 teams that weren’t even at the 25 win mark like 2 seasons ago
Bruh.. this man Trae is a whole damn villain!!!😂
He did the Friga shoulder shake.
ATL in 4
Milwaukee sucks🤣🤣
7:26 dirty moving screen two in a row
Booker Vs Trae in the finals would be the last thing I ever expected this season 🔥
Trae Young is good because he has balls of steel
TRAE YOUNG IS A BEAST
Tres Young not Trae Young lol
Hawks in 6
I was taking a nice nap on the couch during the Bucks vs Hawks game when an explosion startled me awake. It turns out the sound of Fraudnis Akumpo bricks clanging off the rim again. Keep it down Fraudnis!
I guess the Hawks said screw those growing pains.
I’m hawks fan but that Jrue Holiday…
This series is going to be interesting
Bro Trae is a fuckin god 🐐
Trae did what PG could not do. Make your free throws & force your opponent to shoot a 3. Hell, even Giannis made his crunch time free throws tonight.
Ice Trae The Gang 🏀🎵 💯
Could you imagine a hawks vs suns finals? No one had that lol
Trae went off, and they barely won. I think the Bucks still win. Trae can't average 45 points every game
Nets should be here
No one's going to talk about gallinari makes tucker spin
Gooo  bucks  🙏🙏💪🙏🙏
Trae Young is unstoppable regardless whos guarding him!
Trae reminding the bucks it’s the eastern conference finals, whoever watched the game could see how the bucks started the game off like it was a regular season game. Lol Trae bout to bounce these boys too.😂
Hawks were crossing and breaking every ones ankles lmao. Like who's next lol. Bucks?? More like Doe's
Trae Young is on fire 🔥 his floater jumpshot is a masterclass. Had 48 pts 11 ast 7 reb
Let's go Hawks
Free throws last minute no problem for these teams, watching the clippers game 2 😭😭😭
Ice Trae gets Melting to The Greek Freak ....Well played Hawks...
After the falcons loss to Brady in the super bowl, Atlanta needs this W and a championship
I want to see the reaction to those kids who chant trae is overrated
Giannis attemptafreethrow doing great things
Just cuz he's from Boston and looks like a leprechaun doesn't mean Connaughton is Lucky the Leprechaun. getting rekt by Mice Trae wow
If he had hunter, I would feel a lot more confident
Ghetto Filipino ma friend
i still dont understand how trae is the villain when he got spit on and had the whole crowd chanting f u trae and the hawks have been completely disregarded every series............ but whatever ATL THIS OUR YEAR
i always knew trae was an underrated player
Chris Middleton  had a bad game
They just won the 1st game not the series.
4:50 Trae Most Disrespectful Moment, Crosses the defender then shaking the shoulder like in the freethrow line damn 🤦🤦🤦
Trae young on this playoffs is unstopable, .and the hawks is very lucky because of team work..
Just wow wow....
6:49 lol Trae could you maybe play some defense after missing that shot? instead of walking backwards with your hands down while your man throws an uncontested full court pass to giannis for an and 1?
I’m a hawks fan, but I’m not confident with Atlanta winning this one
That last foul by cappella on giannis was never been done by the nets that’s why they lost
PG watching Trae Young shoot free throws and taking notes.
👀
The league is just too good now adays.....if u ask a real nba fan where u rank trae young he wouldn't be in there top 20 but look at what someone who isn't a top 20 player in the league can do 🤣🤣
Watch out icetrae gonna stole the ring..🤣🤣
Young was cooking in his Holiday
Good job. hawks.. i thought PG13 FT.. lol..
Hawks are just simply toying with the Bucks. If they can't come up a with a defensive solution on Young's riddle then this playoffs run for milwaukee is over!
5:05 tucker got cooked by Gallinari lmao
Tonight we are the Milwaukee Bricks
Atlanta Hawks is the underdog of the 2021 playoffs.  - Nothing to lose. - Just playing outstanding basketball led by ice cold trae.  - Dominated the knicks - Upset the Sixers (top seed in the east) - Putting up a good fight against the bucks (heavy favorite)  I won't be surprised if it's gonna be the hawks vs suns in the finals. Two teams that did not make the playoffs last year but dominating in the nba playoffs this year.
Ice Trae #CertifiedKiller
if the hawks get the championship its gonna be awesome and well deserve..
Trae showing pandemic p how to get it in during clutch time.
3:07 that pass looked way off from Young
YEAHHHH!! YALL HAPPY JUST BECAUSE UR IN FINALS BECAUSE OTHER TEAMS HAD SO MANY INJURED STAR PLAYER THANK YOU INJURY
Hawks in 6 easily
20 SECONDS ON THE SHOT CLOCC & PAT SHOOTS IT.
Trae Young will be the first Trae Young
Jrue dropped 30 and the Bucks still lost???   Series over. 🥴
I didn't see any highlights of a Middleton trey tonight.  But it's only Game 1.
Imagine if reddish and Hunter were healthy too
Trae have guts and never scared.  Atlanta in fo! Fo.. fo... Fo!
w0w A Rising Superstar TRAE YOUNG! 🔥 He Wants It 🏆
Haajaahaahahhahahajhahajahaj
Give Some RESPECT  named TRAE YOUNG 🔥
Trae Young is a superstar
Trae>Luka 💪
Nba is so much more fun to watch w/o those juiced up teams. Props to both teams
As good as Book and Trae have shown themselves to be, I would still rather have Luka and Tatum. All 4 are the future of this league, alongside Mitchell, but it goes 1. Luka 2. Tatum 3. Book 4. Trae 5. Mitchell
Someone please drop Ben Simmons and doc rivers roasts
Trae Young 48 pts 11 ast first finals game sheesh 😬
Trae young is better than kyrie.
Bucks aint shit
Air ball a crucial play...bruh these young players choke on basics
I think the hawks got the perfect team... Collins is the perfect stretch 4 who rebounds like crazy capela rebounds like crazy they had 34 rebounds combined ... then you add the likes of bogi,galo,huerter, lemon pepper Lou etc ... they got a squad
Trae is an all star period.
Whattttt?
This… does make me smile
Hawks time to shine now
Suns still winning it all
No effing way? Pls for humanity's sake..i hope the bucks don't choke this series..may Zeus help Giannis win the series.💪
Atlanta surprising everyone
A legend in the making
If Trae wins a championship and finals MVP, the Hawks officially won trade.
Curry : shimmy after splash Ice: shimmy before splash
Bucks suck holy crap
I would love to see a Hawks vs Sun's NBA Finals. They both deserve it.
The nba shows the defensive highlights too
As a Raptors fan, it’s pretty cool seeing small market teams succeed in the playoffs. I’m happy for Atlanta and Phoenix, about time they got better. Both led by amazing young players, superstars. Hopefully my team can draft a game-changer like Trae Young or Book with the 4th pick.
The new villain in the building
Trae is Rookie in this playoffs but he is better than playoffs veteran like Simmons and PG.
As my boy on the analyst team said “ if he can do what he do against 6’11 Ben Simmons what you think he gonna do to 6’4 jrue
Jesus loves you!
Hawks will beat the bucks in 6, then face the Suns in the finals. Calling it NOW!
Greatest teams of all-time:  1. Game 1 Magic 2. 96 bulls  3. 01 lakers 4. 17 warriors  5. Game 1 Hawks
Trae did what Pandemic P couldn’t do, hit both critical free throws. The dude’s 22 years old ffs PG is so trash loool.
Shimmy was tough
Literally no one outside of Hawks fans have them going this far.. this year is a massive W for Atlanta even if they lose the next 4 games
It’s crazy how trae didn’t make the all stars but balling like this yea they made a big mistake
New era of Kobe/Young and Lebron/Doncic. The future of the NBA is in good hands.
Trae has been on FIRE these playoffs. But I've gotta say, their defensive stops have been key and limiting turnovers. Bucks like to look for the next pass to the open guy, so there's plenty of opportunities to poke the ball away. As for the Bucks, their 3 point shooting slump has got to come to an end sooner than later. They're getting the open looks, but the shots just aren't sinking. Best shot they have is clamping down on defense and forcing the ball out of Trae's hands. Easier said than done for four quarters.
Vegas is going crazy
Let's be clear - Hawks didn't steal Game 1, they 💯 EARNED it! ⭐🏀 ATL be ballin 🔥 and they're exciting to watch, really enjoying this year's NBA playoffs! 😅
Who tf would of thought the hawks would make it this far
nice game.... kompyansa lang ang bucks.. 4-0 kau nyannnn .....hahahah lol
as a Bucks fan Trae terrifies me
Small but teribble, young.
Raps fan here, im hoping for a PHX vs ATL FINALS. something about rooting for younger underdog teams feels so exciting!
if khris was closer he would have tied the game rip
If you would have told me the Atlanta Hawks would be 3 games from the Finals I would have looked at you crazy. Nate MacMillian is pushing all the right buttons and Trae Young is taking his game to the next level. Trae Young is the next superstar if they win the Finals
PLAYOFFS IS BETTER WITHOUT THOSE FCKING SUPERTEAMS AND LEHELP JAMES
There were many, in particular, the Bucks supporters who stated that the Hawks would be crushed by the Bucks. The prediction video  (before the game started ) NEVER gave Trae and his fierce Hawks' combatants a single chance. I reminded them that diametric difference in physical height/size had nothing to do with calm and appropriate strategy...that in comparison, Trae to Giannis was after the similitude of a sparrow battling against a falcon...that TRAE young, like little David,  had already taken DOWN a few GOLIATHS along the way and "walked over them". As usual, when I'm in dire need, I call on God for help. That is exactly what I did on behalf of Mr. Young and his team. I ended my commentary with this from Psalm 121, verse 1: I lift up mine eyes unto the hill, from cometh my help. It is my profound belief that when that New Yorker spat on Trae, GOD reached down and out to him and showered him a very big measure of blessing...adding to what he already had. Trae Young shocked the World tonight with an epic performance of 48 points, 11 assists and 7 rebounds. KD is not the only one can demonstrate such prowess.  I hope that TRAE and the Hawks will remain humble and serious about winning enough games to move forward. God Bless the Hawks and guide Trae along...through the rest of this series! Good night, indeed!
I can't believe how incredibly fun this playoffs has been to watch!!!
TraE WAY
Trae young once took a trip to the North Pole.   He brought swim trunks, a towel, and some sunscreen because he’s that cold-blooded🥶‼️
Trae young remind me so much of A.I
Can you imagine a Phoenix - Atlanta Finals…. That would so refreshing for the NBA….!
Hawks vs suns in the finals. 😁
the young players are the ones who do the best in the playoffs: Luka, Mitchell, Booker, and Trae. They all drop 40+ points
trae young better than KD with allstar caliber teamates cant even past bucks🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪
Who cares about all star. A superstar is born.
As a sixers fan enuff with the Ben Simmons shit
HOT TAKE:  Not only will Trae win a fmvp before Steph Curry.  He’ll become greater than him too🤫
Trae Young's post-season run has been nothing short of legendary.
These teams better be glad deandre hunter Aka baby kawhi ain’t out there or I would say the hawks could take the championship because Atlanta lowkey got a squad ...
That shimmy ohh no you didn't 😂😂
Atlanta reminds me of the Raptors Championship run, no egos, play like a team and having fun.   Atlanta in 6
Where are you Charles Barkley? Bucks in foe? That prediction aged well, like your face. Lol
Trae Young is playing like how he plays in playoffs of nba 2k21.. he always goes for 40-50 points and 15+ assists in every game and reaches final.. one time he also set a playoff record for highest points!
Trae is incredible. My Hawks have done it again! We finally have a true superstar.
Every GM that passed up on Trae Young in the Draft be punching the air right now….. This dude is lights out.
Dammit they loss
Bucks need someone to be consistent with the 3’s’
Will it be hWks vs Suns in the NBA finals. The most unexpected teams to be in the NBA finals in history. Crazy.
Seems like Trae young was the better pick then Luka 💯 he carries & actually win Without Not 1 other all star or even Ever been an all star
I'd say Hawks vs Suns in NBA Finals!!!
I TOLD Y'ALL HAWKS IN 5 AND ITS NOT EVEN CLOSE.....
That trade down is looking well worth it.
Trae's last 4 freethrows are like trash talk to PG and Simmons. "this is how you do a crucial freethrows"
Trae disrespectful asf first he shimmies then throws the ball at the crowd
EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED! 😆😆😆
Bucks better guard up.!  Tre Young aint playing no games..Not even Nintendo..
Cold blooded Trae! #IceTrae
HAWKS...!!! YEAH...!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Don’t be surprised if the finals is  the Hawks and the Suns.
Big respect to trae young👉👉👉
We might have a sun's and hawks nba finals ladies and gentlemen
I feel like during these playoffs, Young has arrived!
https://youtube.com/channel/UCeQJexWv3sMIbCXRopajEvA
I guess Trae's floater is the gold standard for that move now. Looks so similar to a lob pass as well. No wonder they cannot defend his PnR
Phx vs atl finals
Trae better hold up this whole series not just one or two games
don't sleep on hawks 💪
this is embarrassing
Does anyone know the song from 5:18?
WHO SHOT THE THREE?  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Last 4 possesions of the game, and Giannis Didn't get to touch the ball.  Middleton 0-9 from three entire night, Coach Bud calls a 3 point play for him at the end. SMH Just Coach Bud things.
Which highlight do you like?
Hotlanta won that Young-Doncic trade 😂😂😂
Trae Young is amazing! He knows his skills and role.
Surprise surprise!
Go go young
Lil 6'1 prepubescent Trae Young dropping 50 pieces in the playoffs and people question whether MJ would dominate this era 😆
6:59 so many gatherings they aint scared
Hawks vs Suns NBA Finals
Bucks in 4 still??? 😂🤣
Hawks continued to impress us every game.
ohhhh the shimmyyyyy! come on ice trae🥶🥶🥶
Let's go hawks let's go young win the eastern championship. Gudluck hawks 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🙏🏻☝️😁
Time to start putting Tre Young in the same category as chef Curry
When u see trae and giannis make both their fts and then u look at playoff p
Dammmmn trae young... just styling on em.... looking like NBA STREETS OUT HERE
The shoulder shake at 2:25 in the 3rd was RAW. Trae is no joke.
suns v hawks would be so fun to watch in the finals
Dissapointed in giannis idk if he got tht IT factor to go alongside his skill and athleticism , he needs to be more dominant and attack the rim and be creative with his slashing
Solomon Hill is in the ECF again. Wow, would probably made it to the finals,AGAIN.
Middleton can't have off nights like these, and I know it's the Bucks offense is to have Lopez camp out in the 3's but it would be nice if he gets aggressive in the post maybe gets some foul from Cappella. Hawks is going shock the world if Bucks takes this team seriously.
Trae Young could have my children 😂
The NBA is in good hands after Lebron, KD and all the other great players that r closer to the end of their careers. Cheers
I keep telling folks, BUCKS CANNOT KEEP UP WITH THE HAWKS.. Giannis will get his 35-40pts but he Will need help. Middleton Nd Jrue are good for only 2 games. Jrue already had 1 of his 2 good games and they still lost.. I said earlier hawks in 6 but its looking like it may be a sweep
Wow what a game both team desurve a standing ovation ☝️
Bucks going to lose the series
I think its time we can draw comparisons to luka for trae
Bulks fan: damn I wish it was Ben who was shooting thoes FT instead of Young....
Tuff 🔥 That lob off the glass from Trae to Collins was DEVIOUS!!!
Everybody counted the Hawks out before this game I can’t wait to see what all the sports media outlets say tomorrow about this game
Wth connaughton doing in that crucial moment
I cant wait for skip bayless to try and minimize this trae young performance
Hawks Vs Suns 🥵
Hawks to the Finals. Just like everyone predicted at the start of the season.
Bucs choked settled for jump shots in stead of driving ball to hoop bad coaching Middletown was awful not sure y he took last shot he was 0 for 9 from 3pt again bad coaching
ATL traded Luca for Trae... where Luca at rn? Just sayin
KRIS HAS TO SHOW UP FRIDAY NIGHT FOR 27+ POINTS
Clint Capela is strong dude!!
Di ako MakaMove On ! NakakaDismaya Ginawa nila sa Superteam ng Nets haist! so wala na clippers nalang bet ko alanganin pa 2-0 na haist! ano ba yan ahaha
🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶.
I mean like Bruhh..... I'm a Hawks fan but come on Bucks.... You left Trae wide open for like 3-4 seconds there....
man! this hawks team is for real💪
Trae TL. Said "Get-That-Dirt off my shoulder"
Bucks in 4. Who? 🤣
Sun's vs Hawks ... ! Booker vs Young !  Will b a Damn good show
Hawks are for real.
Trae becoming a legend
Another vintage no show game for Middleton..So overrated.
Trae is on a another level my goodnesses
Aye they was showing out in the 3rd
let's fucking go
MILWAUKEE THOUGHT DURANT WAS A PROBLEM.YOUNG IS GOING TO BE AN WAR.
Trae be a villain in the east now
Trae gonna shoot them home to the couch. Those shot will come back and bite him. Ask Dame.
Stephen A Smith: this game won’t go past 5, Hawks: Are you sure about that? ATL FINNA GO CRAZY not even a hawks fan but damn 🧊 Trae!!!! All those rebounds from Collins and clint bro wtf
Trae young is so cold, that he once went to Antarctica and started sweating❄️‼️
5:07 underrated ankle break
LET’S GO ATLANTA!!!!! ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAIN!!!!!! PUT SOME RESPECT ON THE HAWKS NAME
Damn ATL is not playing
Happy for Nate
Trae young Future Hall of Famer
All time performance we'll all be looking back on.  Earning it every game. Damn Trae
Atlanta most improved team I’ve ever seen
Look for the bucks to play dirty in game 2.  Bridging, eye gouging, etc.
Holiday balled but they better figure Trae out or this is gonna b over before it even starts ...watch the Philly tapes ...they slowed him a lil bit ...
Trae = mj, but fr tho trae is the next mj he can carry and thats all that matters
Dang Ice Trae cooked them. Great game!
Mans got ice in his veins foreal 😳
steph and trae got similar games but i jus fuck w trae more cus curry is the good guy, like a hero in a sense but that man trae is a villain and loves being the bad guy
So proud that my hawks won
when is jrue holiday going to get the acknowledgement he deserves. smh. no most improved player no nothing. smh. trae is the truth also. the second coming of curry.
4:11 alley hoop off the glass 🔥🔥🔥 #Hawks in 5 .. place ya bets
If you dont like trae young , your just a hater point blank hes the future
They carry the ball like crazy!
HIM TRYING TO STAY IN FRONT OF WHOM AGAIN?
Trae is the revelation of this year's playoff. No longer to be overlooked as an after thought beyond Luka.
😂😂😂😂😂😂 bucks sorry ass this is not kd all alone playing Steve Nash and mike d'antoni offense iso iso kd iso iso kd the hawks really have a good team with everybody contributing not just one player🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
Hawks in 6
4:10 sheesshhh 🎩
Not going to lie this was an exciting game to watch! ATL in 6
Kevin huerter can’t guard for shit , dudes got clip but he shouldn’t be getting that many minutes. I get he ate game 7 but scatter his minutes. Dude is a defensive liability
trae young is literally the villian of the nba
*Miami Heat 🔥 2021 NBA CHAMPIONS 🏆🏆🏆🏆!!!*
I have no idea how you can like the Bucks, they play dumb and their coach is horrible. I hope the Hawks win the series.
The shimmy that turned a man into a star
The Hawks are hungry and hunting for a title all. The Bucks better step up next game or this can get away from them real fast.
Sweep My A$$. Underdogs vs. An Overrated Team. Good win for the hawks! 🔥🔥🔥
LOL  I don't think that too many Milwaukee Bucks fans are reading this comments section, bro.
Nice young
Trae Young with Curry mentality 😁
Atlanta without superstar, very underrated.
Trae Young is what happens when you level up on your ex for trying to dub you.......
ice trae young Is the Next superstar like if you agree
Giannis had about 4 consecutive dunks off of lobs, the hawks couldn’t stop the play and for some reason they stopped running the play that was successful. Coaching is important, I still believe the bucks will win this series though, but due to coaching it will be way more difficult than it should be at the end of the day.
Ice cold! He really shrugged his shoulder thou. " Allow me to reintroduce myself my name is Young"
Trae conference final. Luka can’t get out of 1st round and acts like a 👑
People laughed at me all playoffs about my hawks... They doubted John Collins Skills in my last post..... NOW DO YOU SEE MY HAWKS????!!!!
Trey Another 1 Of Them Kobe Disciples! sHoT out D. BOOK!
What’s with trae young’s hair..it looks like pubic hair 🤣
Earned Respect
Me watching as a mavs fan: 😯😨
People keep forgetting that Bogie (2nd leading scorer) is hurt - DeAndre Hunter (primary wing defender) is hurt - and Cam Reddish (strong bench scorer) is also hurt -- ATL is deep AF
They slept on that young blood,Trey young ,in college and he kicked ass !! Now that he's a pro, these teams better wake up or they going to go home like New York  and Philly...ICE TRAE.... The real deal !!!!!!
trae miss crucial 3 in 4th but still has 100% confidence. Dats COLD 🥶🥶🥶🥶
Yassss Hawks that's how you shut up the critics - WINNING! Trae be ballin 🏀🔥ice in da veins! Recognize*** Cheering you on from the 6 (Toronto 🇨🇦)
How do the hawks keep doing this  Is everyone doubting them? Cuz I have
Kevin who? Trae young!!!
I’m a Lakers fan, and typically will root for the next California team when the Lakers go down. However, it would be so refreshing to see a Hawks vs Suns NBA Finals.
Patrick Beverly > Giannis No CAP
7:40 it's a bird it's a plane no it's antekemmpo flying threw the air greek freak sick been balling hard all game exticted for game 2
Imagine if the bucks lost to a  5 seed again lmaooooo
Ice Trae is fearless, and I mean fearless!!! Superstar! The whole ATL squad is fearless. Everyone (National media) Keep doubting the Hawks! We love it! Great game.
The never panic Hawks!
If Giannis jumps on Trae's ankle it's not a coincidence lol
Trae young vs luka doncic debate has to be revalued.
Hawks won this one but i don't think they'll win the series. Trae needs one more star and then this will be a scary team
Trae is getting ANYTHING and EVERYTHING he wants. When you’re throwing alley-oops off the backboard, you aren’t worried or afraid of your opponent lol
Connaughton now knows what Ben Simmons is going thru
😱OMG Young!
Trae young deserves the people calling him a Superstar
If the Bucks are lucky enough to win the championship Bud will go down as the worst championship coach of all times
peennis asstittycumpoo
Maybe the Hawks are just that good Nate McMillan has my respect for what he did to this young team And of course, Trae Young has taken the next step
Hawks in 6
Ice Trae Better then fluka And Donavon Mitchell
OK so this Trae Young vs Luka trade is definitely Trae Young on top right now he's playing for an underdog team and dominant for 3 rounds he's been the best player of the NBA playoffs 30ppg 10assist
nice game
Bucks nightmare, Atlanta Hawks the enhanced version of Miami Heat.
You know how confident you gotta be in your shot to shimmie in your debut eastern final conference game. I'm a fan icetrae. I've committed to the coldness
ICE TRAE KILLA
Dru Holiday went off I appreciate you bro but the play at 7:16 Trae young one on one against Dru Holiday the tear drop was a work of art
Bucks in 6 still. Unless trae puts up 50 every game and Middleton is cold every game
NBA Final" Booker VS Young !! no more lebrone.
Marv: “HE SHOOK HIS SHOULDER!”
Hawks have scratched the Bucks, but can they keep up the momentum for them to slay the bigger foe?
i called hawks in 5
If someone did what Trae Young did on that shimmy even ten years ago, he'd be put to the ground on a foul as soon as possible. Even LeBron took Steph down once, and it affected his play for the rest of the game.
Ice TREY proving a lot to the league and young talents of NBA
Trae is acting like this is college 😂
Mini steph
Even Giannis made his freethrows but PG couldn't😂
Trae did what Paul George couldn’t do.
Trae’s head look like someone dropped a lollipop on the carpet
Let's go Hawks
Ice Trae has been consistent for the Hawks all playoff long, his best game in the playoffs so far
Never thought hawks would make it this far.
Trae Young is a future MVP and a Finals MVP in this league and he will be going into the hall of fame and named as one of the greatest players in Nba history! 👀🔥💪
Young gonna be trouble this dude literally cared the hawks to the conference finals
Trae is showing the country what we already knew.....Shimmy Shaken his way to being a Super Star.
suns hawks 2021
Bucks bounds back....#34
thats BONAFIDE from NBA Streets 💯
Giannis did not want to be lumped in with Ben Simmons lol the mans been non stop shooting free throws in the gym
Trae Young highlights💪🏾
I EXPOSED LEBOZO CHECK IT OUT
Float on Trae
It is  not yet  Trae's  final form. Wait till he goes bald.
My God this kids Trae Young and John Collins duo is a gem.
Bucks got to rebound or they will get swept
The sore volleyball delightfully whirl because united kingdom symptomatically queue apropos a expensive ferry. fluttering, flaky paint
They said New York was an upset then the 76ers was an upset now they say this first game is an upset when are they going to say the best team is just kicking everybody's Azz...#Hawksonamission.
imagine suns vs hawks in the finals. That would be crazy
Milwaukee fans taught that Trae young missed   those two free throws hahah .  Trae young- I'm not pg13 lmao.
Trae young is superstar he has led  the Hawks to the ECF nobody  thought  they come  this far
Trae Young carrying this team so hard it’s disgusting!
where are the bucks in 4 at?
🚨 I EXPOSED LEBOZO JAMES🚨
Ice cold blooded trae young!!!💪🥶👌
Imagine if the Hawks make the NBA Finals, it would be just like the 1978 Seattle Supersonics (Started with a 5-17 record under Bob Hopkins, he got fired, and the team hired Lenny Wilkens to have a 42-18 record, like this season's Hawks)
Nobody besides the fans expected Atlanta to be this far at the beginning of the season.  Hats of to these dudes they earned respect no matter the outcome the rest of the way. ECF is big
If the Bucks sleep on the Hawks they will be going on vacation. Unbelievable, I didn’t know they were this good. Especially Trae Young, man that dude can shoot.
Lol and Stephen A said he’d be shocked if the Hawks win a game cuz the length of the Bucks LMAO ….  Hawks going to the finals 🔐
I’m at work, did Trae have more points than ads in this video?
WE UNSTOPPABLE
Trae would have been Kobe's son-in-law.
atl prolly gonna win the chip this year
Trae is playing great ball!!! Giannis needs to learn how to shoot facing the basket.
Trae don't like already being counted out lmao
ATL we up but we gotta stay hungry 🔥🥵
Mcmillan is doing grate as a coach he knows how to coach young thats why trae young is awsome this playoffson the other side buds need to coach he got lucky when they face the nets but now bud needs to coach or the hawks will steal it from the bucks
halimaw talaga tree young😂🦁🦁
I believe in the Hawks.  They have worked extremely hard to get here.  Go Hawks!
Marv Albert getting senile or needs his eyes checked.
If you think about it, Ayton and young made their respective conference finals before luka😬
Middleton is scared of the villain Ice Trey🥶, 0/9 from trey, miss the game winning shot.
When giannis makes clutch free throws and Paul George does not…
Hawks gonna win this series they have a fully confidence after beating 76ers
I wonder how next playoffs will be with everybody being healthy and new teams arising. Like suns Hawks and Jazz
Bucks in trouble...
Paul George wants a Free throw tutorial for trae
Hawks and Suns would be a great finals and huge opportunity for these two young teams. Playing their asses off these playoffs
Trae reminds me the prime d rose even though hes not a dunker🤔 now my team in east is Atlanta go Hawks
This is gonna be another long series for the bucks. S/O to Atlanta, they are proving the doubters wrong
🏀KD 🏀TRAE YOUNG 🏀DEVIN BOOKER 🌠FOR PRESIDENT🌠💯💯💯💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Trae Young>Luka
4:52 DISRESPECTFUL
bro i really wanna see trae get a ring
oh hell no trae and John out here playin 2k or on the blacktop or sumn
What a battle tonight between two teams that seemed pretty evenly matched.  Nice win for the upstart Hawks. Trae Young was the master of the hardwood with 48 points and 11 assists. Hope this is a fun and competitive series that goes to six or seven games.
Trae Young is officially the most disrespectful player in the league
Hawks in 5
I think we would all agree that if the bucks don't get past the hawks they will never win a chip with the current core roster they've been building around for quite some time now. This may be the biggest chance they have to win it all
Ice trae 🥶
While Bucks got here by getting bailed by injuries, Hawks got here by beating everyone fair and square
They eliminated the first seed and the second seed. Thats a great accomplishment for Bucks and Hawks. Great series.
Wow just wow trae🔥🔥🔥
trae young so much swag 😎
Yup this is going to Game 7   I’ll give it to the hawks they seem to have an amazing Mental stability
i loved trae took a coffe break at the 3 point line,,,,,,,😯😯😯😂😂😂
4:53 smh the disrespect tho! That's Trae for ya
Trae young the best
Please teach kevin huerter how to play d. He trash bro
Put some respect on John Collins bro
Trae the next steph curry
Ice trae did what Paul George did not do , make his last 2 free throws to force a 3 by Milwaukee.....game over....ATL....
I'm glad I have multiple trae young rookie cards
If the bucks lose. milwaukee dont deserve to have a nba team anymore. And i live here
The best player of the hawks is Collins not Trae Young. Real talk.
bucks need to target young and force him on giannis , holiday and Middleton
Hawks proved tonight they aren't no joke. I don't want to use the term "must win" after Game 1 of a best of 7  but if the Bucks lose Friday go to Atlanta down 0-2 they're in big time trouble
Way to go Hawks 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
If there's one thing Altanta proven no matter how big of a lead the other team may have they always come out with the W in a 7 Game Series but Ice Trae The Gang Taking Altanta to New Heights I Kno the city Hype If It's Altanta vs Phoniex in the finals its going to be a neck and neck close one
Trae Young is the next NBA superstar
I came RIGHT to the comments after he did that shrug 3...  but no one was talking about it yet.
I guess I haven't watched Hawks games that much, I even picked the bucks to sweep the series and now the hawks stole home court advantage  Ice Trae is the real deal, I think the Bucks weren't too serious about this game but now they should be, should be a wake-up call for them
Okay  let's believe in Hawks now. We didn't see that coming.
I like the fact that there's no steph curry or lebron in the final 4.  There's so much more basketball now.
Dream match :Suns vs Hawks we are moving in right direction
Little Steph does it again!
Nate Mcmillan salute
trae finna get ah ring
Icetray so cold! Bucks need to stop crying about calls and play ball. Hawks in 6!
Kudos to Nate McMillan. He has the Hawks playing on another level. He has the right player in Trae Young to get the Bucks bigs in the pick and roll game.
ICE TRAE is about to send them into hibernation lol
So is Trae better than Luka now?
It hurts my eyes Bucks lazy on defense
CHILL MAN!
Nobody can tell me trae young isnt absolutely disgustingggg
The hawks hungry for a prey damn ice trae
the return of curry's era move....young,huerter,collins,gallinari,bogdanovic,williams..both sharp shter..
Congratulations to the Hawks for amazing performances on their game one with Bucks as were 116 to 113 on Eastern Conference Final 😍❤🙏💯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
Holiday must shoot that 3s. Not covvington
Ice ice🥶
Icy 🥶
Get it together Bucks
Happy to see gallinari with a good team
I can't wait to watch undisputed today🤣
Remember: Trae young wasn’t an all star this year. And now he’s dominating the playoffs
Giannis got fired up too late.... he should have poured it on early in the 3rd.  Damn it.
Wow
Trae Young is one of those point guards who knows exactly when to score and when to pass he's deceptive and he does those 2 things great, he's very tough to defend and read, Jrue Holiday is going to have his hands very full in trying to defend him..and Young is very crafty too overall but especially when it comes to drawing fouls.
Who said Bucks in four?? 🤣🤣 Hawks in Six. Hawks vs suns NBA Finals.
Damn. Trae🔥
WHEN REGGIE MILLER CLOWNING YA TEAM U GETTING YA ASS WHOOPED
Bucks in rebuilding mode next season.
Hawks stole one from Bucks👏👏👏
Imagine if we didnt have all these injuries 😬
“Free Giannis”
4:55 The savagery lfg 🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶
I keep telling yall to stop sleeping on ICE TRAE!!! 🧊
Super star is right.
With this win, the Hawks have stolen home court advantage. They now have two of the next three games at home.
Luka to the hawks or suns confirmed
Man I constantly hear how an elite defender Jrue Holiday is and Trae cooked him for 48. Then again they said that about Gobert.
If atl wins basketball is rigged lmao
Bucks gave em one ☝️ gentlemen’s sweep comin’ tho .. Bucks in 5
Bucks fucked up trying to have a shoot out with the hawks
I want suns vs hawks for the chip , i would be rooting for both teams
Giannis will never win a championship in this Bucks team...if they loss Game 2 then its over! Young vs Booker in the finals..
Won the battle, but not the war
Its looks like 2020 heat vs bucks series. Gonna happen again
*i keep tryna tell y’all smh 🤦‍♂️. STOP SLEEPING ON THAT MAN 🧊ICE TRAE🧊💯‼️*
Suns vs hawks nba finals. AOC would call this climate change
The play at 4:03 was so sick off the backboard
Go Atlanta hawks for Champion
Knicks fans made a big mistake by unleashing villain Trae
I was hoping PG13 can do what Trae young did.
I told mfers but they laughed at me 🤷🏾‍♂️
BIRDS OF A FEATHER FLOCK TOGETHER
John Collins is one of the best rebounders in the league
Imagine Adam Silver Reaction if the Finals is Suns vs Hawks
Bruh at this point I wouldn't be surprise to see a kings vs twolves conference finals next year
I love how unpredictable these playoffs have been 😭🔥🔥🔥🔥
Suns and Hawks lets gooo
People keep sleeping on the Hawks. They made the Conference Finals for a reason and the Bucks coming out of the East won't be as easy as everyone thinks. Bucks just lose a home game and the series momentum is now in the Hawks favor.
And people said im crazy to pick Trae vs Booker in the Finals. Looking quite possible...🙏
Go hawks
Trae 'Iverson' young 😤
Lopez what is your doing?
Trae young floater is something special can't name nobody that can do it like he does his floaters
Good decision Atlanta trade Luka for Trae because Trae is better than Luka.
Trae shimmy
Wow
reggie miller is not a superstar.
What a weird year!
Yes love the nba when the underdog wins!!
Fly these REFs to LA for the Western Conference Finals tomorrow. Y’all can have Scott Foster!! 😂😂😂
It's only a game 1, let's go bucks!
why would the bucks not shoot a three when there was 17 seconds left that was a way to lose the game
Trae carried the Hawks on his back helped win game 1
My guy ice Trae 🥶 Yessirr run me my money Vegas! Lol 😂 capela n Collins💪
Man Look at Trae and D Book carrying their teams so inspirational
Trae young owns the entire states of New York, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania and everything in it
Nobody gonna talk about Bobby Portis trying to injure Trae Young? Fell full weight on him for no reason. Dirty play.
And yall said Holiday can Guard Young 🙉
Ice trea
Ice Trae is a superstar 🔥 All NBA...make no mistake..forget the media narrative around Doncic
Thought someone said the bucks are going to sweep this team 🤔
Down 0-2 is the start of sereis Bucks vs Clippers in Finals
I never expected the Hawks would come this far
The Hawks are the only playoff team that hasn't faced a team with serious injuries (unlike the Suns)
Trae Young is officially a superstar...
i’m calling it hawks in 5 🥶
Jrue Holiday couldn’t hold Trae Young’s jockstrap tonight.
Man the Hawks really are the Dark Horse in the play offs huh

Both the Hawks and Suns were top 5 lottery teams 3 yrs ago. And from that point both teams drafted franchise pieces in Ayton, and Trae respectively. On top of that built perfect teams to complement both players. And it’s all playing tuition now. Legendary 🎯  Edit: I replayed that crossover on jrue holiday by Trae, Atleast 3 times. In my eyes Trae is the 3rd best pg in the league only behind Curry and Dame 😤
Ohhh trae young cannot lead a team ohh trae young too small ohhh trae young is going to win the championship
Hawks🦅 eating up on the deer jerky 🦌
a lil Huggies baby out there hooping with no care in the world. Love to see it. Kid is special! Steph Curry of the East. Trae vs Book in the Finals 🔥
The hawks out rebound the bucks.. great job clint capela.
The question now is will the Hawks sweep the Bucks not the Bucks sweeping the Hawks 😅
Tbh that airballed 3 sold the bucks
Ben Simmons would’ve pass the ball after the shimmy
We got the Hawks fucked Up
Connaughton is underrated af
Let's go Hawks!!
🤩 🤩 🔥🔥🔥😂
one-man offense vs trio deer 🤣🤣
BUCKS GETTING TIRED GUARDING THEM HAWKS YOUNG LEGS HAHHAAAA
Imagine thinking the Knicks would sweep the Hawks
Bucks lose this series everyone should be fired
*Man can my Hawks get some respect now. Even if we don't win the series give the squad some respect*
I think we all underestimated the Hawks this year 💅🏼
Ice trae 🥶
Wow hawks proving everyone wrong.
Ice Trae da gang
Damn Giannis made both freethrows unlike pg13%, but still lose
Hawks win another one Yannis gonna tackle treys ankles like he did kyrie.
This Atlanta Hawks team time and time reminds me of the 2004 Detroit Pistons.
This team is so much fun!!!
Trae Young will never miss the all star game again for the rest of his career.
Trae Young lit up the Bucks. It's hard for anyone to believe that Kyrie Irving wouldn't have made a difference against the Bucks.
nba is 100% rigged .makes big money nba
Pat connaughton is the jr smith today he shoot  3 from deep does not even hit the rim...Crazy Pat made thw bucks lose
ATLANTA IN 4
SAY YOUNG THE MAHOMES OF THE NBA.....
Hawks in 6
Travis Schlenk built a dynasty in Golden State now he's doing it in Atlanta
Bucks in 5
Clippers will win the championship 🏆
This year Hawks team is last year bubble heat
2nd qtr Bud: ok we winning, Teague and Forbes can get some trash time minutes 4th qtr Bud: ok, we lost the game, but it’s only 1 game
Suns gone win title
This is the definition of a win win trade for two teams
Man it's good to be up1
Trae just his teammates more than the And 1 guys KD,,Kyrie and Harden remember he got good mentoring when Rondo waz there then add in Capella ol' School 12p 19 rebs
I never bet any of this team to make it past round 1 but here they are. Sad year teams plague with injuries. smh
Coach Bud needs to he fired for the Bucks. His inability to make adjustments is terrible. On the fly or over a series. Talent carries that team way too often in my opinion. And his lack of being able to adjust or call plays to get his "go to" guys going continues to make winning hard for that team.
Trae Young wasn’t selected in All Star because he is a superstar
We are really going to get Hawks vs Suns. This is some 2k sh*t going on. 😂
This playoffs feel... different. In a way that everyone has a shot at the title
Let’s go HAWKS
Trae and the Hawks deserve to be in the NBA finals. They seem to be more determined to win it all.
I visibly cringed every time middleton shot the ball
DELUSIONAL BUCKS IN 4 people where you at suckahs!?? 😂😂😂💀🤡
Trash bucks Coach without Lopez in the paint Trash Middleton poor shooting
Why are they called apartments if they are together
What this is real 🤦🏾‍♂️
https://youtu.be/xu0rhJkA1x4
Trae young has made it to the eastern conference finals in his first year in the playoffs at the age of 22, and passed curry’s career high for points in the playoffs in only his first playoffs... let that sink in. This kid is special
Ice Trae for life yo finally atlanta is winning
4:08 is 🔥
Happy for my man Trae; out there making everyone wish they picked him instead of Simmons.
Atlanta fans…good for you.
Bro pat Connington airballing the game-winning 3 I am done with that man
A couple days ago I said the bucks going to have their hands full with these hawks and all these people saying I'm crazy and the hawks do not belong on the same court with the bucks....I told em an ice storm was about to hit Milwaukee and we will see🤔🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️ ....🥶🥶🥶...hahaha.......HaHa!!
This page really is more reliable than Simmons' free throw career.
NBA is quick at releasing these highlights eh
Brook Lopez is literally big for nothing
You really gotta give Trae Young & this Atlanta Hawks team credit & respect for even being here in this position. Beating the Knicks in 5 games, beating the 76ers in 7 games & now being up 1-0 against the Bucks in eastern conference finals. Regardless if Atlanta win this series or not this team have been playing lights out & I think they will only get better years to come especially with Trae Young.
Trae is the Reggie Miller of the Hawks.
No He Didn’t “NO HE DIDNT”  -Reggie Miller
SUNS IN 4... NEITHER ONE OF THESE TEAMS CAN BE EM.
2021 Trae young = 2001 Allen Iverson
That lob off the glass top 5 all time ‼️😤😤
Y’all thought this was gonna be easy😈🤣
Trae is todoroki from my hero academia he can be fire or cold af.
I'm so upset with the bucks
TRAE YOUNG🥶
Brooke Lopez needs to stop doing a drop coverage on screens. It’s what gobert did against the clippers and that’s why the clippers won the series
trae Young popped 5 3 point prayers  in the last 7 mins and missed them and bucks still couldn't win
Suns vs Hawks, it’s confirmed bois and gals.
Da hawks made me into a believer 🙌 dese is sum Dawgs
Even if they win the chip...the Bucks need to fire Buddenholzer...and man was Middleton awful in this game.
Bricks middleton
Put some respect on trae.
Who the goat ?
Bucks just got upset. Clint Capela was made for that. The crowd was quiet in the last minute.
*I KEEP TRYNA TELL YALL!! STOP SLEEPING ON 🧊 TRAE!*
Too early to say but a Finals between youngbloodz and vets would be awesome: Booker/CP3 vs Trae/Lou Will
if you dont consider Trae Young as a superstar now, you are a FOOL!
Why do teams take a 3 when u only down 1 with like 25 secs left in the game 🤦
Trae Young Stats 48 Points 11 Assists 7 Rebounds
Middleton is shiity idc
That damn ice trae is deadly
If trae wins the chip he’s a top 5 point guard in the league and he’s not 4 or 5
Trae Young is the new face of the NBA...this is our reality now
I wonder what people think about the Trae Young Luka Doncic trade now.. Lol and yes I live in Atlanta
The Trae Young pick n roll is the most deadly play in basketball rn 🥶🥶
The Hawks won because Trae Young was not Paul George.
Imagine if the Hawks and Suns will face in the Finals, it would ba a battle between draft mates, Ayton vs Young
The Hawks are the dark horse of this year 💅🏼
Las Vegas had the bucks -9 😭
Hawks upsetting every big team this year
Bucks gotta fire that nigga Mike
Newsflash bucks this ain’t the injured ridden nets this is a healthy hawks team ready to play
Can't believe that these hawks have no all stars selected this year
Hats off to Nate McMillan, The Hawks,and the city of Atlanta!!!! Pacers fan here.  Haven't had this much fun watching the Playoffs in. Long time!! Atlanta is 4 real!!
no more Milwaukee lucks :D
Trae is better than steph
Clint Capela is Better than ANTETOKOUMPO
Ice Trae ❄❄❄
Trae Young getting bailed out Again By the refs 😂
MILWAUKEE BUCKS DON'T PANIC BECAUSE THE WEAKNESS OF ATLANTA IS THE TREA YOUNG HE ALSO SCORE THE ATLANTA DO YOUR BEST DEFENSE TO TREA YOUNG NEXT GAME LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOO BUCKS 🏆
does anyone else feel like this game was 30 minutes long?
When it’s all said and done, Trae Young will go down as the best point guard in NBA history.  Calling it now.
Ice Trae with 48 points. What a sensational player. I wouldn’t be surprised if the Hawks made the Finals.
It’s Trae’s second season-let that set in
The experts was  like how are the hawks going to stop Giannis my question is how is the bucks going to stop Trae young
Phantom foul calls all day baby
TRAE ALL THE WAY #HAWKSINFOUR
Trae young must be the MVP
YES ATLANTA 💪💪💪💪🙏🙏🙏🙏
Dude the MIL Bucks really lost to   the ATL Bald Eagles
Please everyone keep doubting the Hawks, it’s definitely working against you lol
Reminder the nba picked Ben Simmons over Trae Young
Trae Young SHUTTING ALL THE HATERS UP
Give a moment of silence to those fans who said the bucks will sweep the hawks.🤣
Trae young showed Paul George and Simmons how to hit free throws down the stretch
trae young just had one of THE MOST disrespectful pre-celebrations ever. kids gonna be doing this all over the place now i just know it
Yessir tray carried the team 💪🏾🔥
Nate The Great… just form the Berlin Wall and #34 won’t score more than 20
If we lose to the thrashers everybody needs to go
SOLID WEST L.A.
The fact that Ben Simmons got an all star appearance over Trae young is unreal.
What in the literal fuck was Middleton doing🤦🏾‍♂️🤨 Im a bucks fan but I knew not to sleep on the hawks them boys dangerous😬
imagine Hawks bringing home the trophy... that would be nice
Bucks taking this series Middleton had an off night yet Hawks barely won
Galing
ICE TRAE TO THE FINALS
I saw a lot of “BUCKS IN 4” before the game started, what happened??? 😂😂😂

Middelton is trash, should get traded
Ice Trae Summer
Trae young is that guy pal
Trae young is mad underrated he’s as good as Luka
TRAE from not being an All star to super star 💯. Respect 🙌
Trae really about to hush the knicks stop the process and the 2x mvp in 1 playoff run🗿
Giannis Give me a Oat meal and Swissmiss 😢
Them young Hawks came out and shocked the world tonight
I cant imagine this two teams are facing in the finals..im solid supporters and fans here in NETS..
Bucks are so disappointing lol I expect this to be a long series though.
Ice Trae man how can you not like this guy, he legit KD'd the bucks game 1
I’m a bucks fan and respect to trae he’s a very talented player and I’m disappointed in the bucks tonight
Bucks should learn how to box out, they choked again this time and the hawks was undefeated in every game 1, They won against Knicks game 1 and philly game 1
Bruh kris Middleton went 0/9 from three
Its only game 1 but the bucks should win this series
It’s the Charles Barkley effect!
Trigga Trae! Middleton, Idek what to say about him.
I want to see the duel between Luka and Ice Trae in the finals like the way it was with Magic and Bird.
Bucks went out sad in the last two minutes
no Trae Young hate on here!
We know clippers and bucks in the finals
Steph Curry and Dame Lillard are the only point guards who are definitively better than Trae Young.
Mark my words.. These will be a swept
Hawks are going to the Finals. Book it!
Ice Trae! 🧊
BREAKING NEWS: Reported at 8:30 Est time an Ice Storm has it Milwaukee
Ok This might go unnoticed but I’m an up & coming rapper worth the listen 🎧 Btw Hawks in 4 🔥
The official villain in the NBA ATL as its beast
Earllyyy
Connaughton air balls wide open three,Flight would’ve probably hit the actual backboard or rim lol
Everybody from the 2018 draft flourishing right now..   Except for Marvin TrashBAGley
Trae Young collecting infinity stones🐐
Nate McMillan is honestly more deserving than Thibs, (obviously Monty should’ve won it) but what McMillan was doing after the hawks went 14-20 is outstanding
We already know who won the atl and mavs trade
Trae Young the lil badass kid everybody wanna whoop 😂
PUT RESPECT ON TRAE YOUNG'S NAME!!!!
You hate to see it boys, Trae Young is just built different 🥶

Hawks always seems to win game 1 on the road Trae has a great performance I still got the bucks in 6 tho carry on.... 💪
ATLANTA HAWKS WINNER: GAME 1
Luka my favorite player, but Trae Young is CLOSING THE GAP between him and Luka.

Basketball god let ATL win this series they deserve it!

Even I underestimated this Hawks team. But they got that dog in them! And Ice Trae 🥶… dude is clutch
Props to the NBA’s YouTube guys for getting these highlight videos out less than 15 minutes after the game ends

PAT SOLD
Trae young creeping in that top 10 and Middleton falling out the top 20-30😭

Trae Young is a demon and the truth, Hawks are playing amazing
Trae was abusing jrue
Trae Young is going crazy  48 points omg 😳
Hawks might win the championship.
If trae young makes it to the finals idk what the nba analysts are gonna be thinking
Hawks in 6 mark my words
Ice trae is a different breed out here!!
Middleton was horrible tonight. That's the problem with him, you never know when he's gonna show up. Too inconsistent.
Bucks Fans: Bucks in 4. ATL has no chance.   Also Bucks Fans: And I oop...😲  😩  🤣🥶🤣🥶🤣🥶🤣🥶🤣 🦅🏀🔥
I bet big on the hawks,I took the points,I should of bet money line ,great game,I'm happy I have a nice ticket to cash,take my wife and kids to knotts berry farm with the winnings,we like knotts
Trae young really like that don’t play with him
" BUCKS IN 4 " 😂😂 STOP SLEEPIN ON US BRA 🤣🤣🤣🤷🏽‍♂️
Charles should not predict any more series
Bucks forgot they ain’t playing a injured nets team
These Hawks keep surprising me day in and day out. They’ve certainly won me over the course of these playoffs
Trae must be having one of the best playoff debuts in NBA history. He's been going crazy in the playoffs 🔥🔥
I know all the attention is going to Trae but DAMN John Collins is nice
literally a minute how tf are y'all here. did u watch the game and went straight to youtube?!
Giannis impressed me in the loss by making a bunch of those free throws.

Folks hating on the hawks so bad but fuck y'all Georgia folks deserve a championship and the hawks gone give us 1 remember this comment
Trae reminds me of a young Wade when he carried the 06 Heat in the playoffs. Wishing Trae the best!

The Heat couldn’t even win a game “Bubble Guppies”
LMAOOO Trae was toying with these boys
ICE TREYY!!!!

Wtf. This is so unexpected. These hawks are surpassing all expectations.
"Bucks in 4. Hawks too inexperience. Giannis too big for Trae." SHUT CHO AZZ UP!
Ice trae 🥶💯💚
It’s crazy how many people Trae young has proven wrong throughout this postseason
A Reminder that Ben Simmons made the all star over Trae Young 😂😂😂
The future of NBA is bright
That bucks win against the Nets was just a mickey mouse win just like the Fakers winning their mickey mouse ring. Nets 2022 NBA champions. Finals MVP king KD
BUCKSIN5

Trae Young is the biggest all star snub of all time
God bless everyone
People are saying this is bad for the ratings, but I don't see why, I absolutely loved the uncertainity of the playoffs this year!
