I LOVE THESE GUYS SO MUCH THAT I SMILED THROUGH OUT !!!
Young adz got sm knowledge bro
solid interview
Love Adz man , THE REALIST
26:00 - lol one of their old 1xtra radio interviews they said ‘we tell our fans to trash the venue - we don’t own it so go ahead’ 💀 moving like Travis Scott
to the people watching in 2025,this was the best DBE interview in 2021
if young ads really cared about central c he would of told his engineer to mix centrals verse  but i understand it’s “pressure”
dbe 10/10
we wanna see Insomnia 2, 3 and 4
Went to there concert in December it was lit
Haven’t even listened to the album yet but going off Home Alone n the singles they’ve put out so far I'm sure it’s gunna slap👍🏾👍🏾
Soon as i saw the goat, that told me they sold out🤐
“I’ll give you a standing ovation” stays sat down
Ok lb I see you shining 🥶🥶💯
The interviewer looks like that guy from BMF
can't wait to see them tomorrow, I genuinely love DBE
Am the only who thinks young adz have a funny voice?
Inspirational man, don't stop!
24:00 - "Take away what a man has and he is left with what he is"
What's with the satanic album cover though. They proceed to talk about religion yet show satanic imagery. Strange.
These man are in directing some one in the scene 😂
LB Speaking on growth is so true he went crazy on the project
album cover is a goat... these people are witches and their music is poison from the devil
Adz flow on ski dream and pay attention next level favourite
The cringiest name
Adz needs to go solo tbh, let’s be real he’s the talent, the new mixtape Wernt all that either expected better
Big bro 🌐1️⃣
Go crazyyy🔥😂
Home Alone 2 is their best project in my opinion. Great stuff. I so much prefer them being on point.
These guys are the goats, I can’t comprehend when people say otherwise
Waiting for PTSD 2

This is my only request for DBE  please please watch wolf of wallstreet then do a Video for Cryptos & crime.
The 🐐🐐🦅🦅💜❤️🎿🎿👑 Young Adz Dirt bike LB, see in my hometown  next Wednesday Motorpoint Arena
That Crypto joint hit different still. If you know you know.
“ live with it.” “Live with the music”.
“ live with it.” “Live with the music”.
Adz is so intelligent man's got knowledge in him fr 💯
💯💯💯💯💯💯
they been boo before these two they humble and I rate them success .....
Can’t wait to see them on the 8th of December
He’s clearly miserable in his marriage yikes
Whole album full of bangers
Respect to all three men. And Adz flow on Intro is hands down my favourite
Ima make a song w these 2 one day trust me
proper cleanhearted guys man
Dbe X Max B now ....were waiting
in the past year DBE had started popping hard ways in Australia in particular Perth these boys gonna keep going to the top every song a banger this album wasn’t one of my faves but either way had bangers in it and keen to see more
Great interview
amazing interview
Black sheep a hardo😂😂
He should have brought up m Huncho up
Never seen adz so sober
nahhh loved this interview!!
Lb probs on the perks why he got the glasses on
The first min and a half and LB has already spoken more than he ever has in a interview ever....ever
King wallahi luvvv💞💞💞
Great interview
There music is something different swear to fk I love them
i wonder if they know the original d block from America styles p jadakiss been around for almost 30 years I'm kind of interested in their music now nice
The way they talk is so calming
The best DBE interview I’ve seen, it’s crazy to see how much of a difference the drugs make. Look at interviews from years ago they were slumped , they now different artists big up them both Home Alone 2 is sick
Bando baby🔥🔥❤️🇦🇫
The tune wid tiny boost my fav
Proud of  u 😍🤗💯
not sure if i get what young adz is saying 😭
What the name of the prada bag Lb’s wearing
Interesting interview
💯💯💯
young ads speaking straight facts about mental health
These man really do the best interviews
that song with wretch was one of my favourite DBE songs, collab worked perfectly and they all shelled their verses
Great interview and interviewer
Tape is cold and dat, but Blue Print defo my favorit of all of them
They need drop Pakistan 🙄
Pakistan dropping when tho
Been waiting for this one still
class video this, great interviewing and we can all agree that dbe are the best in the scene rn
From kitchen kings to kings of their empire 👏🏽 You have to acknowledge the elevation 🥺🤍✨🧿
Best in the UK
Yesssss finally dbe is back with another interview
Adz looks way more healthy since he stopped the lean, big up the GOATS of the U.K. 🐐
Not forgetting NO RECORD LABEL. Levels
Lb really has levelled up because he even speaks in interviews now u can tell his mindset has changed before he was very quiet on interviews
you see their albums though you need to take it in, really gd honestly, especially patek pain , don’t go , black sheep , blood diamonds , overseas , tbh everything. (listen to their songs with headphones or on loud and take it all in fr fr.
Classssss
I Fucken love this interview
Lb off the lean is so much better
Coldest in the uk 💕💕💕🎿🎿🎿
Seeing Adz go fanboy over Ed Sheehan made my day 💯
Great interview
cant wait for it
My first listen I always think their album is mid, then I just keep listening and it gets better and better
I like that Lb started to talk more in interviews in the past it’s more adz doing all the talking
This is the most ive ever heard lb speak in a interview
cover art designer here
Worth the wait only thing that was missing was Benjamin AD I get he probably wants to make it on his own ting but a cheeky feature since it’s been crazy long was needed hopefully the next tape 🙏🏻
Don’t forget nipsey
I still think home alone 1 is way better
actually so proud of them🥺.
know what''m sayin?
DBE goes hard! 🇿🇼
I really rate DBE but i am not a fan of the new album. No way near on the same tier at Home Alone, Street Trauma BluePrint,PTSD etc. My opinion anyway, just wanted to see if anyone else on the same as me
Don't go, one of the best songs on the albumb, wish he had a better response when Adz asked what he thought
Best project yet 💨🔥
you can tell they took their time on this album
DBE 🐐. One of their best interviews and amazing to see their influence and growth.
These man stay humble and speak facts even after all this success, and thats why people like them aside from their music of course
Take a shot each time they say ‘youknowhaimsayinn’
Worth the 1 yr wait, the album is just on a different level, no one can do what they do independently
I rate this guys interviewing skills & big up to DBE always come correct, even the way they talk to each other to answer a question
Still need dem to drop Pakistan doe
DBE definitely have taken long to release Home Alone 2 but it makes sense because they once released 2 mixtapes in one year and people was saying they sound the same. So it's worth the wait.
First
