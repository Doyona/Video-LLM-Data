That young lady at the end was definitely top 10 all-time in the 5 years I've been watchin'. Reggie you're amazing and truly are da' mang!
She's really great   Beautiful voice
Conquering public speaking through public singing.  Can't beat that.
"Where did you guys meet?" Ha ha ha, Reggie, you're so funny.
Last girl kilt it!! Literally born from legendary!! And he was there wathcing his baby girl sing!!
You play out? Yes I’m in a band. Oh really.  What band. Foreigner. 😳
Is there such a good show and it brings up the best in everybody makes them feel good makes them happy and it gives them confidence about themself what's the host is so humble
I love this singer ! Super talented !! Her dad was a guitarist for foreigner ! She is a shining star !
I'm your fan even I'm from Romania.Good job, dude! If It's can be possible meet you in this life I will be glad singing something  by Tom Jones or Big Brothers.Anyway,you ARE a really so good musician.AWESOME...!
The twins are too cute
Wow , you rock girl !!! (i am talking bout the nice girl/woman from dad and mom  fro Foreigner )
That womam was the bomb!
I need to stop all your comments and recognize the man that appears to have one goal. Reggie, the guitar player always asks after the performance, "how do you feel"? His intentions are so poignant because most people walk around and just take care of things they need to do. Reggie is helping people take a break from life and feel good. I call it helping people get out of their own way so they can see something else. Brovo Reggie. I wish I was as talented as you because you must live a life of reward. Thank You!!!!!
Thank you Reggie for all you do

Bro. WTHeck???  A FOREIGNER band member walks by with his daughter???  How incredibly random and cool was that moment?!
Beautiful 🎉❤🎉
Reggie’s a linguist too!!!!
Awww
That's one talented family right there at the end, Domenick Allen -toured with Foreigner 1992 - Once married to Wee Lucy Ewing from hit American show Dallas and now with Leigh Zimmerman pictured and their very talented daughter Cayleigh Allen now known as Cayleigh Capaldi plus he's a fellow Glaswegian. Great video this one.
EwF Majesty of Music ❤
She is a wonderful talent - full stop.  What is understated in this video, however, is that  her dad is entirely focused on her and not his own successful career - kudos to him 👍
Cayleigh was fantastic 😮😮😮
That girl hits the highs like Mariah.  Fantastic!
kids sang tears for Fears song..wow what a surprise!
Earth, Wind, and Fire! She is one of the best singers that sang with you.
Cayleigh capaldi
The girl sings beautiful professional
Woww a foreigner band member !!!
Reggie, you’re just making happiness everywhere you go
Wow, Foreigner used to be so hot!!  Feels Like the First Time, Cold as Ice, Hot Blooded, and on and on. Some of those Gen X golden sounds. She rocked September - beautiful follow through on her notes, and pushing to get that exact note for her key. Thank dad for the genes and lots of hard vocal work!!  peace and love
wow!!! Foreigner guitarist and his daughter jamming!!  nice singing young lady!!!
those young twins were super cool!!  nice!!

Canada calling. Thank you so much man. The world is in a mess. This shows the true nature of humanity and peace. I remember when you started out Reggie. Years ago. All by yourself. Now you have a crew and have nailed it. It's something I need to see everyday to maintain my sanity.

Merci guitaro 5000 de proposer cette idée d'accompagner un chanteur ou chanteuse dans la rue....du Street Art de haut niveau..MERCI Monsieur ENCORE merci.....
The dad was filming with his front camera. Never seen anyone filming like that.
Calleigh needs to be on American Idol or the X Factor wow she's great and so was her Daddy  :)
Cayleigh is an ok singer at best.
Cayleigh hits hard here
The twins are so cute awww❤❤❤❤❤
Love elvis and this song awww thank you for singing it awww❤❤❤❤❤
Reggie I watch you you tube channel and I think your a great man keep up the good work
Where in the hell that young boy get it from he didn't get it from daddy he got it from mom
What nobody seems to realize about the vocalist singing September is that she sang the song in a completely different key than the guitarist. This is why they sound dissonant ("out of tune") together in places like 14:24. The guitarist started the song in the key of D, maybe to accommodate a higher-pitched voice. However, the vocalist proceeded to sing it in the original key of A, up an octave from Maurice White's original vocal. While her Pop vocal stylings are very nice, musicians need to be able to listen and adapt and hear when they are in the wrong key.
I love the twins!
Reggie you are awesome you make such a difference in people's lives man
Reggie you have many great singers, you have a real gift with people, thanks for creating and sharing your amazing channel here on Youtube! Cheers from the UK
So touching
Good job love it
Is it really ba-dee-ya? I've always thought it was party-on. I'm dumb.
To all the people that says her dad was never part of Foreigner: Go Google (And Youtube) Bruce Watson and Bruce Watson daughter, and see for yourself what comes up. Oh yeah, her name is Kaylee.
How’s she going to sing with chewing gum in her mouth?
You go girl you did great good job
She is amazing singing
Amazing people.

OMG her dad is Domenick Allen who was lead singer of FOREIGNER for a short time after Lou Gramm left. He should've sang too with that guy. Foreigner is Rock history!
She sounds like Tori kelly
Democrats and prisoners are the same. The both have 24 hours per day to think of stupid shit to destroy the lives of other people.
Amazing awesome to watch and enjoy Reggie. Always interesting chat and you never know who you will meet.  I'm really enjoying this great songs voices and throughly enjoy your guitar playing and conversations.

Why are you telling the kids who just said they only speak English to say “thank you” in Chinese? That’s racist af. Very disappointed in an otherwise sweet interaction.
Reggie is a brilliant super nova spreading joy in seemingly bleek world.  Thank you Reggie.
So Great!
Awesome ❤
And Caiylee isn’t in the cast of Titania anymore they appear to have a drag queen in her role! Well no offense but I wanted to see Caiylee not Cayqueen!
Caiylee using all the tricks and instructions of her previous music teachers and coaches not to mention her Dad! Good job Caiylee she’s at the Saloon every Tuesday night
Nice job Caiylee turning September into a show tune! I could see the Trolls doing this version
Great job to Hason and Justin
😢😢 He remembered his mother. How touching.
The 25th night of September? I begga ya pardon?
Cayleigh... talented and fun!!
The tein boys were amazing!!
Amazing singers in very different & beautiful ways❤❤❤. Thank you Reggie for sharing & encouraging the love❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉😘
She was great!!!  And I LOOOVVVE FOREIGNER!!  ❤❤❤❤
Beautiful and WOW !!!!!
she had great energy.
jason/justin- so cute...
We love karaoke. Whenever someone comes over and really sings great we (joke) that they can never come back. I love those kids!
reg you are a minister of music.
This is the best one ❤
Reggie, I’m a Regina and I met Elton John and he is really a Regional!!   He signed something for me that was “To Reggie from Reggie” ❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉  I love 💗 your videos. ❤❤🎉🎉
What I love is FINALLY learning lyrics to songs I started listening to in the 70s.  LOL
Reggie doing God's will spreading the love.
No detriment to you Reggie you’re playing is fantastic but, sometimes you need to up the tempo, I’ve noticed some of the singers struggle to drag the words out to keep pace with your playing, speed up just a little. You are a great musician and entertainer.
I'd have $hit meeting a Foreigner band member! So many nights cruising with my friends just driving and listening to music. Constantly switching between the radio, cassettes and 8 track! Good times.
This is a great concept keep doing it Reggie , there are some awesome singers out  there.
September... she has a very cool jazz voice and really delivered.
The little boys were adorable!
Everybody was good, but the twins will go far.
I wish I became a choir director like my heart wanted to 30 years ago. ❤ or went into the music field. Thank you for helping people dream for awhile and share their talents
The twins picked an awesome song - Tears for Fears! Right on !
I love what you do Mr Reggie
Bro literally had no reaction to a guy from foreigner I’d die love that band
Girl who sang September sounds like Teena Marie❤
That was all, all awesome
CAYLEIGH IS A GEM!!!
AMAZING!!!
Enjoy the music.
Maravilloso canal. Felicidades saludos desde Bogotá 🎉🎉🎉🎉
I had a smile the whole time the twins sang
I’ve listened to Christopher sing Elivis to his mom more than once, and I get chills every time. He put so much emotion into his voice. So beautiful! You made that happen Reggie! What a gift you give to others!
Deep cut for the twins
I love to see young people so smart gives me Hope 😂🤣😎
So randomly awesome that the guitarist from foreigner just happened to be walking by. His daughters super talented
Hey Reggie awesome as always,But its better when they hold the mike when singing it seems they really get into it..just saying but its wonderful what you do😂❤😅
Reggie is so COOL!!
🎉⋯⋯
EW&F 'September' is one tough song to pull of solo, considering its horn-driven energy, uptempo neat and layered harmonies. Props to the young lady for having the courage to sing it and do it well!
How sweet are the twins? Seems like a nice family!
I think I love you. No homo but you have a talent, personality and a beautiful spirit. Keep on doing what you do please.
0:39 when I close my eyes I see what others are thinking. it has the ingredients for a movie. Boy and the guitar and Shy schoolboy
They all fire .. especially the last lady 🔥
I hope his mom sees this and it brings them closer ❤
Wow she’s amazing,…. 🥰🙌🏼🎉💕
What a cutie 🥰
She's amazing and Foreigner - how coool is that! Did you feel any pressure playing in front of him? They seemed so nice. Loved the twins!
first guy should have picked a prince song...he kind of looked like a younger prince
You do so much for the community, I wish you were here in my area. I would sing with you and give hope to our community, we had a bad spell here, do I wish for a better outlook here.
It only JUST hit me that it's 'ba de ya' and not 'par-ty onnnn'. I just got this after watching this a BUNCH OF TIMES while READING the lyrics and then listening to the original, then this again. 🤦🏻‍♀I have no idea what is wrong with me.
I love when the camera turns to the mom and she's dancing
My God! The last one was awesome!!! Cheers!!!
Damn, I'm having fun just watching you from my bed. I can just imagine how much more fun it would be there with you and all the friendly people in New York. Now I don't believe what people used to tell me about New Yorkers being unfriendly. It's a myth busted.
Awesome, awesome!!!!!!!
8:48
What a sweet voice, little Elvis!
Every video I've seen has kept me smiling!! I love music but I can't sing well, but you've made me happy ☺
The twins were very cute and did great job!
I watched before. And i hope 😊his Mom and he are on good terms now....❤
Reggie - you so cute!!

September was incredible! 🎶🎵🎶
I always come to this channel for the good feeling it gives me. The singers always say they feel so good after singing, but they make me feel good too, even after a horrible day. Thank you, Reggie, for doing this. ❤
THAT GIRL WAS ON FIRE!!! I WANT HER COVER ASAP!
I love these twinsies ❤❤
im in utah why do i think i know this guy craziness so fun
Hey Reggie good stuff the Foriegner guy group has 3 # 1s and gold records lol
Omg her dad was a band member of Foreigner. Popular 1980’s  band…
OMG foreigner is one of my top 5 bands thats amazing getting to meet him and his family
Simply magical! Bravo Reggie you are amazing.  :)
Kinda wild that the guitarist from Foreigner was just walking by with his family 🤔😂
YOU BETTER PLAY!  Damn Cayleigh is so great!
This is a great example of the America I love!  Thank you
A lot of family (things) in this video
That was the shitty cover i heard of September
Such a top man Regi.

Wow what an incredible experience. ❤❤❤❤
Brother, you’re a good man you bring joy to people that’s wonderful
She sounded amazing notice her power tone  was so refinded...
The girl was awesome. I knew her dad looked familiar. Foreigner was a great band in the late 70’s and 80’s. I think they still perform, but some of the members have changed.
Reggie, U Da MAN !!           ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Though I enjoy watching all the singers, the young lady singer EWF's September is my FAV!! She did her thing and she had a great personality! 😊🤩
SEPTEMBER  12:00
I loved this. There is so much beauty in imperfection, people just want to be heard.
Well done Christopher.. Family first.. Esp mum ❤
The twins were so good and so cute!! That was definitely fun to watch!! ❤❤❤
You're doing a great service for these people, giving them a chance to show off nicely, cool off from troubles and connecting with you, and audience and themselves. Great social project❤
Famous singing dad and mom is an actress from Home Alone who slapped the guy haha. She is singing September and has an excellent voice. ♥️
i actually love the band foreigner, so cool to see a band member just randomly haha
She was electric!
Domenick Allen 👌🏽
Oh, I played for a little band called Foriegner... you might have heard of them... they only sold 80 million records.  There's some serious chops in that heredity (obviously).
Chinese kids know what they're doing, ask a yank wouldn't have a clue🤔
That was nice
SO much talent out there
The boy in the blue teeshirt....what a warm, lovely, soothing voice. I could be rocked slowly to sleep with him singing like that 😌😔😴
September has the voice of an angel 😇 so truly blessed with such beautifully graceful voice which lifted my Spirits 💗💪 she's got such energetic vibes and should start her own channel if interested as I felt she shld know truly how blessed and inspiring her vocal energy is /wit great meaning!!!
she sing like ariana grande ;3
Dang, I can't believe those twins new a 80s song, I was born and raised in the 90s and my cousin who was born in 2012 did not know what a Walkman was in 2019.... ??? Lol no correlation but I really miss searching the shelves for cassettes and thought cds were dumb??......also funcoland... if yall ever get a time machine could you send me back to the 80s so i could live in the 80s and 90s as an adult???
jason was at my school too
YO JASON AND JUSTIN WENT TO MY SCHOOL WTHHH
She was so good 😎
Reggie, I'm so happy to see you make it.... especially doing this❤❤❤✌️✌️✌️
Reggie you are truly an inspiration of hope and joy in the world through music. Bravo
Her surname is capaldi is she related  to lewis capaldi
OMG! That’s Bruce Watson of Foreigner! I didn’t recognize him until he said he plays with the group. His daughter has an AWESOME VOICE!! ❤
My nose is runny because of my allergies i swear
oh my god ( foreigner.). That's huge and the family is so humble..
Damn this woman can sing! Those riffs and high notes she was doing were truly amazing. Great song choice, it fits her voice very well.
Awesome to see the brothers sing together.
I JUST LOVE THEM ❤❤
Awwwww twins are cute ❤❤

Cayleigh's parents are so proud of her. I hope all the parents or soon to be parents can support their kids in the same way hers do. Thats what truly makes kids successful.
Okay Septemberrrrrr

Amazing man!! Good on you!!
Reggie didn't know how right he was when he said we have a rockstar.
this gal needs a contract
wow
I like her vibe, I want to be friends with her
Those kids were awesome
That first guy is an amazing singer
Elvis is great but I need to hear someone sing a BJ Thomas song
I am WISHING and HOPING for more music from Cayleigh Capaldi, she is just beyond fantastic - and you are absolutely amazing as well, Reggie!   Much love to you, your co-workers and all the fans who appreciate ALL you do sir, because it is A LOT <3

Reggie, I had to stop buy and drop you a comment.. You are the real deal, it is so enjoyable watching someone do what they love to do, and do it so well. you interact with people in such a respectful and encouraging way. Keep up the great work! and Thank you.
Beautiful how music unites people
I love this, we all need to get along and singing brings us together
Caleigh great job.❤
Foreigner ❤
just found this channel and I'm digging it. beautiful content  and much talent
First time watching and love it. We need more happiness in this day and time
Very cool to here a song from my Era brought into the modern age. Well done. The fact that her Dad played with Foreigner, even better .
Especially love the random special effects put in. Like an address map and when one twin was 36 seconds older
Amazing video work, a great support to humanity
Seu trabalho é simplesmente sensacional! Parabéns!!!👏👏👏🙏
THE BEST. THANK YOU 💯❤️
My god cayleigh absolutely rocking September!!! Cool version and she can sing!! Respect!!.. bringing joy Reggie...I would love to sing with you but I cannot sing a note!!❤❤❤
The first person brought tears to my eyes! So beautiful
As usual, a great time had by all.  I really liked all of them a lot.  However, Kayleigh and her parents just kind of grabbed me too as they were walking by and you were asking if they wanted to sing.  I certainly didn't know that she was in a show, and my Lord she is fantastic!  Seriously great.  However, what a completely awesome treat it was to see that her DAD WAS A MEMBER OF FOREIGNER!  I grew up with that band, saw them in concert 3x at least!  It's what we did in the 70's, & 80's!  WE WENT TO CONCERTS ALL THE TIME!  I grew up 2 miles from Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Morrison, Colorado so that was a huge blessing for me.  But I attended as many concerts as I could all around Colorado and Beyond.  Loved Foreigner, and  awesome to see his family and how nice they were.  Thank you Reggie.  I think it is so cool what you do, and became a fan on the first video I watched!
She’s great, wow
You need more of her
Got a beautiful voice lot’s family to guard you out having your journey fulfilled every body in this world listen to her thanks for sharing ❤
Good job
Sehr schön,junger Mann.👍🥰
Man, you're such a good person! Your raise is an absolute success! Greetings from Bulgaria! ✌️❤️🇧🇬
She was great.  Thank you Reggie.  You should sing more with them.
YOU KEEP MAKING MY DAY OVER AND OVER........REALLY A GREAT IDA, AND YOU DO IT SO VERY WELL....THANK YOU !!!!
when the player rom foriegner says you are awesome, that is a huge compliment.
He’s a sweet Angel. And so is Reggie 🌹🙏❤️❤️
New Zealand 🇳🇿 😊 love this...
You my friend are changing the world 1 song at a time.❤❤❤❤❤❤
The last person/ woman was extremely talented,amazing vocalist with so much soul,she was music - she can sing without music! Very talented.
Dad: "A band called Foreigner" Reggie: [Has no idea who that is]  😆
Holy smokes! That girl can sing!
Reggie is so wholesome he didn't even mention this girl's dad is part of foreigner to get clicks, just let's people shine as they are, gosh I love you Reggie ! Thank you for existing 💖
I wish you were here in Northern Ontario, I'd be singing with you every day ❤
Reggie I want to meet you
The twins sound like basses. I was expecting sopranos.
Reggie I hope u get this message. Music is my therapy and for many too. Music heals people, help them deal with every day issues. What you do is amazing. Thank you ❤
A total 'set up'---the singers are not just casual city workers way-laid by a street musician with a guitar: they are all 'professional' (or 'trained') singers---afrom the two boys here---and it's a 'way to cash in' on making money from Youtube. Of course it's quite entertaining, if that's what you want!!!
Wish u al da best bru
Foreigner… love that band ❤
I grew up listening to Foreigner! His daughte killed "September"! I was hoping he would sing a song too, but he's a good daddy, it was all about her!
Kayleigh, you're good!
Been binge watching a few of these now and just wanna say that you can literally SEE peoples walls come down the moment they start singing... all the awkwardness and anxiety just fades away and its wonderful to see! This some good shiz🤌🤌
This is one of the most fun channels I’ve ever watched!!! Thank you for what you do. Wish I was in New York right now lol.
Wow!
This was a very emotional session, Reggie, meeting a band member from Foreigner, that young man dedicating his Elvis song to his mom, yeah that is life and that is music, it just makes me happy to sing along here and dance the night away.
Your the bomb Reggie
<3
Reggie is a therapist!
Is quite selfish of her dad to not want to stop when Reggie asked more than once Come and Sing with me ,him knowing that he was a musician but then found the opportunity to open up and let us all know why he did for a living
Damn this kids chose a hell of a song I saw them live in concert and they sound like yesterday
September girl was arrogant.
That cover for September made the hairs on the back of my neck stand.  I love EWF and she killed it.  There is some serious talent out there and to hear people say that they feel good after singing is great.  I do like to sing myself but keep it to the car and at home.  I tend to sing more R&B, at least I think I can sign, but again, some serious talent out there and this is just enjoyable to listen to.  Keep up the fun Reggie.
Energy can’t be seen, or heard but felt.
Not only does domenick allen come walking by (foreigner for an extremely short stand in) but his wife Leigh Zimmerman (the woman who slaps marv on the street in home alone 2) and their daughter cayleigh who also has pipes....whatre the odds. Pretty sure the guy the arrows pointing at at the foreigner show isnt domenick allen btw
💐💐💐💐
He was amazing
That was beautiful and I'm glad that he let her sing September
Played in a little band called Foriegner ??????
I have got to pause I am addicted to your channel. I sure wish you'd come up to Northern Colorado.  This was another great show.
reggy is such a sweet person
September girl is almost a pro.  Awesome.
Foriegner and Journey were my top 2 growing up. I would have lost my mind if I had been there. And he was so cool about it. Do you play? Yeah, I play. Were you in a band? Yeah, i was in a band. I would have asked if he wanted to play a song w/ his daughter that evening. STFU and GTFO.
My favorite song!  Was my husband's and I song.  He's gone on to be with Jesus!  Thank you for singing it.
So glad I found you. Restoring the faith
Reggie  Your videos help me  In hard mental times You bring light  Thank you  Gary from Winnipeg
🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
Great👍
That girl who sang ‘September’ had an amazing voice/ vocal range, wow!🎤
Reggie almost seemed a bit star struck with a Foreigner member there ;)
Mom call your son, life is short❤🎉!!!!!!
Awesome twins🎉
She is awesome!!!!!!🎉
I’m shocked by how much talent so many people have!! These are so fun to watch. Thanks Reggie. You’re awesome. ❤
BLESSINGS TO YOU FOR BEING A GREAT JOYFUL SOUL!!!❤❤❤😊
Dude, you are so good for the world. God Bless You forever!!! I love your videos; love seein' you bring people together. Love it!!!
Cayleigh Capaldi  sings 🎶 Lov N you / WARNING ⚠️ Put your crystal glass  awa y !😅
Thank you Cayleigh and her parents for your  contributions  in the entertainment industry.  Many of u have seen momma Leigh in "Home Alone" she punches Pesci and  Stern ( the bad guys) in the face 😁
👏👏👏

Fcuk, again 😢
Just loved her voice and performance!
Cayleigh...beautiful Soul Beautiful Voice this gurl got Skillz Everyone else was awesome too Xx
Good lord.. what was that famous painting?
Cayleigh just totally wowed me. Beautiful job!
Reggie absolutely loved this one and the twins were great as well✌🏽🎶✌🏽Especially Ewf’s September
Foreigner stopped by! Nice to see that talent  passed down.😊🎉
Her mother is absolutely beautiful
no fuckin way these kids want to sing Tears for Fears.... good lads. and then some fucking how the rhythym from Foreigner makes an appearance with his phenomenal daughter. unbelievable video in my eyes.
I don't know her, but I hope that she makes a living from her voice as she seems to be talented enough to do that. I love her enthusiasm!
Why isn't there more content like this getting pushed by the algorithm!? Love this!!!
Christopher was your star tonight. He sang with such emotion and devotion. I really hope his mom saw this. You're a star, Reggie for bringing out the best in people. The lovely young lady and the twins were great too.
“Baa-Dee-ya” finally after all these years I know the words!
👏🏻
You are awesome brother ❤
Cayleigh…super singer and so full of life
❤❤❤❤waaaaa!! So cool
Christopher is very cute. I hope his mother gives him the love he clearly deserves.
That was awesome
Was that Thom Gimbel?! Amazing singers as always!
Awesome
Pops is in Foreigner!!!  Daughter's got pipes too, though, if a little shrill for my taste.
Omg I am crying, not even my son lol hope you are proud of your wonderful son. Don't forget to tell him how much you love him !!!
I need more of this lady
That rendition of Everybody Wants to Rule the World hits different if you've seen Mr Robot
I love how you make complete eye contact with people the entire time you talk to them. So amazing.
Her mom played in Home Alone 2 as a blonde woman that her bag grab by the thief in the side walk...  what a coincidence 😆😆
Wow🎉🎉🎉 everyone did amazingly in their own right - not gonna compare them ❤ The Foreigner guy - what the what??????????
WOW!!! September!!
Wow Reggie.  You've got so much talent and you let others display theirs.  I love  your channel.  Thank you!
What a sweet young man.
You ROCK Reggie! You’re always the star of the show in my book❤️
mention me if i forgot to push like button🥰
The girl who sang ' September ' must be a pro.She nailed it beautifully 🙏
Cayleighs voice was amazing.
Oh wow, that was incredible!! What a gift she has and that she shared with the world! I don’t know who would want to follow that 😆
My favorite post of yours to date. This one was awesome!
That .01 percent resides with us Reggie.  You're a giant among the trees.
I loved all the performances. The first guy very nice, the twin boys fun to watch and  the young lady at the end did GREAT!
The lady who sung September oooooooo talented . She could definitely make an album or if she hasn't already
Awesome video Reggie. Especially the band member  whom you met from Foreigner which I'm a fan of
Great show Reggie.
Amazingly good!
I was born on the 21st night of September. The one in 1963.
I thought I recognized him wow foreigner great band
Cayleigh fantastic
That was awesome 🤘
Sweet music 🎶 🎶 and singing..thank you…you’re a🌟Reggie💖
No wonder you made Cayleigh´s evening, you let her sing for herself instead of being paid for and it makes a big difference.
Holy shit, imagine you are live streaming and Ian Macdonald stops to watch. What a legend
Seen the woman on Facebook and had to come find the channel to watch again. Love this content 👍🏻
I love the young fellow who needs his Mum.. 😢 .. But Gran always steps up .. All the best young Man
Last singer you are absolutely amazing!!!
Randomly meets a member of Foreigner, crazy. No surprise Cayleigh could sing so well.
I loved the last singer energy and voice. They were all good though.💕
Wow, that September song. She killed it♥️❤️🔥🔥🔥
You looked like a rockstar, yes, foreigner😂great👍👍👍
Enjoy it.
Loved the young man who sang for his Mother. I hope that relationship can be repaired, I have two sons myself.
wow the ,,canthelp '' part really awakended some in me waow
great singer
Loved it Cayleigh and loved your dad's band, at one point, my favorite! Love and blessings to you and your family.❤
11:19 minute Foreigner band member
Beautiful
The third one looks like Merryl Streep.
👏👏👏👏👏❤❤❤🇧🇷🇧🇷
Well i fell in love with voice of cayligh
Wow
haley has talent! Shr should pursue it!
"EWF" I thought who the hell is that band? Funny how the younguns gotta make everything an acronym. Ohhhh! Earth Wind and Fire! Yeah, I remember THEM! I really don't know why more people didn't stop and listen to this woman's FANTASTIC voice! Where can I hear more of her????
08:46 Domenick Allen ✨👏🏻
Just a band called Foreigner lol
Ummmm Foreigner ROYALTY!!!!  That Cayleigh was....well....wow!!!  I think it must be in her genes!  And let's mention the difficult song she sang!!  Hello???!!!!   WOW!!!
casually ran into a member of Foreigner
The mother is leigh zimmerman bro, wtf. Also the casual "you ever heard of foreigner" lmao
She has an amazing voice
Love it good my dear love you too have a beautiful day ❤❤❤❤
I need Christophers @ he’s 🥰❤️
The guy from Foreigner, his daughter has a great voice!. She does it all! Foreigner was huge in the '80s!
This cheered me up ao much because my Mom lives a couple of blocks from there. I miss my son now too— and as a music teacher, I love the concept of this YouTube channel! So generous…
As always Reggie, Amazing. I hope you NEVER achieve the .01% needed for 100% satisfaction. You do the world of music PROUD. Keep it up.
cant get over with her voice ❤❤   now i always play this song 😍😍
It's funny that you can tell which of the twins is gonna be a rebel. My mans, hair was a bit messier and he went for the fist bump everytime lol.
Domenick Allen and Leigh Zimmerman literally contributed to the entertainment industry for decades, cool to see them just out and about supporting their daughters dreams as well. Seems like such a down to earth family for one exploding with talent.  Edit: It's also funny reggie asking about the dad, Dom and leigh might not be the most known but they're probably like "Yeah, we've been around" in their heads lol.
That last girl I'm pretty shore every vocal coach in the world would say she a has a amazing voice
Foi demais esse dia! Todos arrasaram! A que cantou September foi demais! O pai deve ter ficado super orgulhoso. Muito legal esse trabalho que você faz Reggie. As pessoas saem mais alegres depois que cantam!
Bravo que bien canta, enhorabuena!
YOU BETTER PLAY!
Nice.
She takes her singing that to her daddy she was awesome
"You better play!"  I feel like that is one of the highest praises, especially from someone who just finished singing whole ass PRODUCTION PIECE(S) FOR TITANIQUE, and Cayleigh deserves all of the applause for being just outright amazing.  Keep coming back over and over to her version of EWF
Reggie...you're a good guy!
I'm very impressed no I love the fact that you touch people's lives I take my hat off to you Reggie bravo bravo Bella Bella🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤
Hello from France ! I would like to say that I love the concept of your channel
Music royalty is who you played for there... Wow, that's beautiful! Tears as it comes to a close. What a beautiful moment...
I was surprised by the song choices, specially of the first one and the twins. They have great music culture 🙏🏼🤗 my faith in younger generations was restored 🤭
How am I supposed to get any sleep tonight after finding this amazing Reggie and all of these great singers?
The last singer i really loved it!!!🥰 thank you both!
Talented Cayleigh growing up with musician parents   9:06 mother helps holding flowers, was a broadway actress, Leigh Zimmerman
Bro, the September part, she's golden.
I've never even heard September sung live, just the version attached to the video and she just took it to a whole new level and i thoroughly enjoyed her voice!
That's beautiful what he did for his mom😊
Life is short go hug tell her you love her God bless you❤
omg... Foreigner ??
Se nota que lleva la música en la sangre....Gran voz y actitud
That was lovely. It’s so nice to see the young man felt better after singing with Reggie and I hope his mum enjoyed it. ❤️🙏🕊️
Little star struck...... but that´s ok .. I would to if I met you....
Bravo 👏
caileigh m'a surpris , je ne m'attendais pas à ça , elle chante vraiment bien !!*
Thank you! Beautiful voice!
Discovered your page today. God bless you, sir. You're doing God's work
Reggie, I LOVE you and your videos! Sometimes it's just great entertainment. Sometimes it warms my heart to tears! In every video, you shine a brilliant light! Your kindness is far-reaching and so many are blessed by your service! I know that I am! Keep shining...💙
Every singer you have on your channel brings tears of joy every time. What an inspiration you are. You have a huge heart ♥️ it really is beautiful. I’m sure you’re changing many lives for the better. Singing in my choir makes the stresses of life evaporate and makes me feel very grateful for the moment we have on the earth. That’s the power of song.
Reach out to your son mum x
Great ,Top,Show da Bola!
🥰🥰🥰🥰
For those who are wondering, Foreigner was a band who sang "I want to know what love is"
these kids really dapped him up hahaha
Thanks!
As Always so touching and so kind ❣️
Hi I am from Brazil and i`d like to sing song with you one day
I like the concept of your channel. You`re doing a great job in discovering many talents and personal stories on the street. Besides, music heals (I wish this goes too in all countries of the world to at least keep us sane and at peace with one another.) Keep up the good work, Reggie. Watching from Victoria, B.C. Canada.
I hope “Mom” heard him sing the Elvis song. He’s quite a singer!! Loved it!
this was the funest l have  watched  l realy ❤ your videos
Wow! The last lady really showed that she is the daughter of a professional musician. Great singing ability. It was so good I had to listen to it multiple times.
May God bless Cristopher and his family.. I hope they reconcile and live happy forever❤❤
Such a sweet young lady! She was raised well, kudos to her parents! She has a great voice!
Christopher, the first guy that sang, sweet heart: dedicating the song to mom although they were "not in good terms at the moment", great voice: slow and steady and good-looking guy. KUDOS on all!!!
21st night
hey guitaro, my fave part was at 12 mins 20 secs when you sung with Cayleigh. Pause that and see how you both looked into each others eyes and recognised how good this is ( not a love thing) just recognition of true artistry. I must have watched this performance at least 20 times. Man that lady can sing. Then top it off with her father was in Foreigner, just woww man, mind blown. Keep doing what you are doing Sir, RESPECT from Australia and ALLL around the world. Well done mate! EDIT, Make that 30 times now. You 2 should form up and perform as a duo, the people will love it, such great chemistry. re edit (sorry last one), that dude at 14 27 just chillin and enjoying the vibe, he digs it. Be well, big love to all.
the last girl singing style is just like Coco Lee
Reggie you knocked another one out of the ballpark. Your videos just keep getting better and better.
I hope his mom sees this and feels so proud/loved. 😔🙏
The young lady was amazing!!
El gusto de las personas de cambiar la melodía de las canciones cuando cantan bien, me estresa jaja
Try spotting John Petrucci on the streets of NY next time..
The boys should sing together,  twins harmony is the best.
Yeah great voice
✨💖✨
It’s a linger time I’m watching you already, You do a great job Reggie. You are charming and you give a lot to the world! Wish I could sing with you one day! Best of luck!
YOU GAYS HIT THE TRUTH......GOD BLESS LOVE FROM CANADA
Foreigner?!!! One of my favourite bands. Greetings from Denmark - great work Reggie!
AWESOME BROO OOMMMGGGGGG 😂👌✨❤❤
This was great. The girl that sang September was really good. I think it’s awesome that her famous dad did not steal the spotlight, that’s incredible. I am impressed with him and the fact that he said Foreigner like it was no big deal. I’m also moved by the kid who dedicated the song to his mom. As a mom, that touches me. I hope they repair their relationship. God bless them.
Wow.  NY  ShowsOut...   Praise Yah
Amazing vioce and guitarist ❤❤❤fantastic
The woman had her own fabulous sound. I really love her style it was very unique and soulful.
Good job and they are so cute twins
I wish they had something  like this when my grandmother  was alive she could sing gospel.  ❤ my mother and aunties also
Awesomely amazing!
I've missed seeing your videos! Thank you for sharing  :  )
Oh my what a treat! ( I would of asked Cayleigh's parents to play / sing some Foreigner)
YO when u coming TO tx *cough* *cough* Beaumont area :D
Good job J&J!
Nice job Christopher. I’m sure your mom is proud of you
Thanks, Reggie, Greetings from London UK❤❤❤❤
That warmed my heart...
Stunning vocals from all singers. We need to hear more from them, please.
I see the proud momma!
Dad was giving the nod of approval.  You're doing a good service Reggie.  I'm still looking for that gospel citizen to stop by.😄
Ha! I’m watching this on the 25th night of September. Cain’t stop watchin’   love this YouTube channel
So awesome that you got to meet a member of Foreigner (the band)!! And Cayleigh can SANG! Dang girl.  Reggie I love watching your videos. Thank you for being you. ❤️
old mate is in foreigner!
CHRISTOPHER!!!!!! LETS GOO!!!!! <3 <3 <3 <3 <3
⭐️⭐️⭐️ This young woman is a Meryl Streep identical twin!!!!!!!
She killed September! It was AWESOME! She had me at my desk dancing and singing along with her. And the fact that her dad is a member of the band Foreigner was like AMAZING!!!!
I want to sing with you, but I'm in Toronto :( when u coming here?
This magic belongs to elvis
Love how its nighttime for me on september 24 right now :D
The Young Woman Who Sang, September Had A Really Nice Voice, Sing On Girl, You Sound Great! ❤💯🥰🙂
Me Too ❤😊❤
Wow! That was so cool seeing the daughter of a member of Foreigner. Sooooo cool! Great job with your videos Reggie!!
You know what I really like about this bloke? He shows us all that humanity is so important.
🎼🙏🎸😽🎤😍🎵Dearest Reggie, thank for the music! You are an absolute Star! Oh my God.... If I could sing, I would definitely sing with you! Bless your heart and your Team! Love from Portugal and Mozambique ❤🎶😘😘💐😻👏
i can see Zoom H1N there Sir. /  what is that For?
What a good son… call your mother tell her that you love her😊
💖💖💖💖💖
I love these videos! They make me happy.
It's a pity that Dimash didn't pass by.
Shows a lot of courage. Great job. Confidence builder. Thanks for sharing.
Darn, I was so so disappointed that the member of Foreigner did not sing us a song. That band brings back so many memories. Darn darn darn. I was hoping for this at the end of the video.
September excellent.
Reggie , you have a special gift in what you do ... I think with that young man , you’re gift healed him ..  who could want a better gift than that ?
That young lady needs a record deal ASAP!
The twins singing one of my fav.
ahh! those twins!! LOVE!!
Thanks!
Just love these.  Thank you! 🙏🥰
Singing the song for his mom 👍👍
I shed at least one tear of inspiration per video. Thank you All.
good on you young fellow for making an effort to sing, love it, and you SIR!! thank you!! for sharing your expertise on your Guitar
4:50    21?  i woulda carded him for candy...
Wow … the tears are running down my skin… thank you so much… thank you 🙏 Thank you 🙏 thank you 🙏 ❤
I wish this young man all the best for him n his family ❤
Loved the last girls energy, her dad played in Foreigner, respect
Wow September!!!
Wow Foreigner! Good music.
Wow, that was awesome!!!!
Excelente versión acústica de SEPTEMBER. Gran cantante. Espero que haga carrera porque tiene mucho talento.
he is great quitar player
Happy vibes as always!!
Last girl has a voice like Ariana grande. This was so amazing to hear
Who's the best concert read
Cayleigh killed it, man.
cayleigh Capaldi is awesome !!!
Gorgeous young fellow.  I can imagine him to be a lovely human.❤🎉🎉
cayleigh sings like tori kelly!
You are fantastics!! greetings from Uruguay
reggie i think you job just got more fun lolllllll
Reggie your the best, so enjoy your channel, thank you.
Great work of  everybody
Awesome ❤
The twins were adorable, the teenager with Elvis is sweet, teenagers are often not on good terms with their parents making parents often feeling unappreciated, well his mom knows now she is loved, titanic spoof girl has such a great aura around her and her dad letting her take the spotlight being a musician himself, cute. And she had me the first 3 notes! Wish I could see titaniqe... probably funny as well as ear candy. Loved her modern spin on the song. Made it her own!
Hello everyone
"A spoof on Titanic" ?? That is so distasteful
Cute, nice voice.... some vocal lessons and he'll be knocking the socks off everyone.
STAY BEAUTIFUL ALWAYS! ❤
Her voice is beautiful
Goodness….she is fantastic!
This has become my favorite channel….
Cute as hell….
Na..... < Christopher got it going on.  Lotta weight off your shoulders. Nervious... I can relate after performing. Serious Dude, Thanx. Hope Mom likes it.  ....... OMG, Huge smile on my face for the Twins! Guitaro! so cool.   WTF!  >>> A band named Foreigner! WHAT! Then the Daughter! My growing up music! Holy Sh*t!  Y'all did SO good Reggie!  Wish I could sit down on the pavement and watch you and yours.  As Always, Blessings. Alex from Miami🌴
Ma'am your version of September ate that! How cool Domenick Allen of the Iconic band Foreigner and Famous Actress Leigh Zimmerman just walking by with their daughter!! They definitely passed on that torch of talent to their daughter Cayleigh who's also an actress and singer.
That was awesome. I would have loved if she did a duet with her father. Her voice is as amazing as his is. Awesome clip. So cool.
wow, the last girl being a pro really shows, she was fantastic.
Are you kidding me? September girl killed it!
WooHoo Justin and Jason!
I don't know why, and I don't know if you'll se this message lol, but almost all of your videos make me extremely happy and make me cry on this happiness!  thanks a lot, bro! and greetings from Brazil!
Two excellent performances! 🩵 what you do, Reggie.

Reggie has lovely ways with children too, always respectful humble and sweet with everybody. ❤️
Foreigner?!! Hello! Famous 80s band. If I'm not mistaken, that is Bruce Watson.. but my eyes fail me so I could be wrong. Lol.

You really helped this guy. Way to go 😊

Reggie has the best job ever! 🙌🏼🤩💗
Christopher was lovely bless him and Justin and Jason are fab the lady was a delight. cracking ! I find these videos really uplifting
Hi Reggie, I'm from Brazil and I started watching your videos on YouTube recently, I really liked them. Could you try playing a Brazilian song with someone?, I have a very good suggestion, (O Sol, by Vitor Kley) this song is basically played only on guitar
You are so good with people. You play the guitar so well, you complement your singers. I smile and get happy every time I watch your videos.
when upload new video
Nice one guys
The first young man made me cry right away and I hope he sorts out his problem with his mum. I can tell he still loves her so much. ❤
How awesome was that  young lady,  now there's  lady who  knows what to do with her voice. Well I guess with a dad like hers it's no wonder wow what  a fantastic a find❤❤❤
such a pleasant person to listen to! Perfection in every note! So dancy:)
Bro has anyone sang Give one reason by Tracy Chapman? I like that song
Reggie, you are so amazing! It just floors me the varied talent that you have and how you inspire people to come out of their shell. A talent on so many levels! Much love ❤
I totally agree the young man who dedicated the song to his mom did a wonderful kind thing!
WOW!! THAT GIRL CAN SING, THE DAUGHTER OF THE ROCK STAR 😂 😂
Yea, Rock Stars daughter sings. Always a fun channel.
When will you be back in NYC?
I thought the dad looked familiar.  I knew the girl would tear it up...she has that vibe.  Awesome video.  I liked all of the performances.  The twins were  inspiring and amazing!
Great job young man. Good Luck with your mom.
This is great!!! Love your unselfishness to allow people to sing with you! Wished I was in New York
Not into secular songs but the young man who sang the Elvis has a really nice tone....
Sending out so much love and hugs to the first boy. May your spirit never break.
Foreigner❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️Whhaaaaat😍😍😍😍😍❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️
Oh wow u made me cry ❤

Man Reggie's videos really make my day.
The lady as beautiful voice
Enjoyed this so much! Thanks, Reggie!
Yes foreigner sing the song i wanna know what love is very nice song
❤Christopher attitudes. Much deeply in love/respect with his mother & .family.  My admiration. Wish him the best of luck on his career/life. A happiness. Hugs.  Have a nice day🙂everyone.
Damn i hope caleigh is getting paid
as soon as the first guy started singing i just started to tear up. he wasn't a beyonce, but I saw his emotion and his heart and his humanity and the melody and lyrics cradled that and now i'm emotional. and those supportive women mouthing the words nearby with gentle smiles also warmed my heart. such a small moment.
I love that regular people get up there and sing. If I ever see you I wanna sing.
What Nice young men! Brotherly Luv🥰 Elvis would be Proud, and Mom is too!💚
JnJ ROCKS!!
sir i respect you even more asking Jason and Justin how to say thank you in Manderin.  you don't see a lot ppl asking someone how to say something their language.  same should go for ASL or any sign language in our world ..  Ask and learn.. your awesome. you make ppl feel so good
i love this
❤ you reggie
Love Christopher
You should work on your interviewing technique, its kinda awkward sometimes 😂
It's wonderful to see so many people are willing to sing spontaneously!
Thank you so much Reggie for all you do in bringing joy and happiness in to the world. God bless you!

Wow. You are a lovely person. How fortunate the world has a man like you.🎶💜🎶
Do you know with Dementia patients they never lose the part of there brain that remembers music and how happy it makes them .My mother had Dementia and visited her for years and would go to there music room.And got permission from owner to play music my mother had a great voice.She was Scottish and loved hearing Scottish and Irish music .Iwould play it and the residents that were walking around and confused and upset wanting to go home .Would sit on the chairs and join in and the joy and happiness in there faces was ajoy.tosee .Also family members would join in and make the visit happy.And they would remember every single word .But can't remember 5 minutes ago .Iwas asked if wanted a job there Isaid no . Enjoyed my aged care job .🙏❤️💯
When you do things from the heart 💖 it's joy happiness that is what you have when you have Jesus Christ in your life.Feel Good and know you are Truly loved like never before.Try it you will fall in love with Jesus like so many have .He won't let you down he only wants the best for you .But so many think he is a Fairytale he isn't and with him if you believe and have Faith there is a better ever after .🙏❤️💯

Best cover of September ever!! Still dancin'.

Os três mandaram super bem.. teve boa ajuda super músico é claro 🎸🎼🇧🇷👍🙏
Cayleigh would have been great singing some Teena Marie woohooo
Beautiful version of September. ❤
This young man who sang for his mother put all his emotions into the song and people felt it - it is sometimes more about feelings than technique
As incredible as his musical talents are, the greatest skill Reggie possesses is his ability to bring out the best in people and making them feel good about themselves.
❤ beautiful Christopher! I'm getting addicted to these videos! So uplifting 😊 The power of song and music and human connection.
The last lady wow

The lady singing September OMG SHE HAS AN AMAZING VOICE!!!!!
In the United States there have been numerous legal cases about regulations and laws that have decided the rights of street performers to perform in public. Most of these laws and regulations have been found to be unconstitutional when challenged. In the US, free speech is considered a fundamental right of every individual, guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth constitutional amendments, and in the majority of legal cases it has been concluded that practicing artistic free speech is legal. Street performing is legally considered to be artistic free speech and is protected, just as is panhandling or begging.   Street performer on Duval Street, Key West, Florida with displayed permit on guitar In the United States, reasons to regulate or ban street performing behavior include public safety issues and noise issues in certain areas such as hospital zones and residential zones. In residential zones, a reasonable curfew may be allowed. Such laws must be narrowly tailored to eliminate only the perceived evils by limiting the time, place, and manner that street performing may be practiced. They must also leave open reasonable alternative venues. The only exceptions to these free speech rules are sedition, as defined by the Smith Act, public displays of pornography and obscenity as defined by the Miller test for obscenity, criminal behavior such as fraud or defamation, certain commercial advertising and the common laws talked about above. In the US, laws regulating or banning street performing must be applied evenly to all forms of free speech according to the first and fourteenth constitutional amendments and the judicial decisions listed below.  Street performing cannot be prohibited in an area where other forms of free speech are not prohibited. For example, if street performing is regulated or banned but people are allowed to conduct free speech behavior for pickets, protests, religious, political, educational, sports, commercial or other purposes, then the law is illegal. In the United States any form of regulation on artistic free speech must not be judgmental, and permits must not be so restrictive, complex, difficult or expensive to obtain that they inhibit free speech. It is also unlawful per federal court decision for law officers to seize a performer's instruments.[1]  Under Title 18, U.S.C., Section 241 Conspiracy Against Rights, it is unlawful for two or more persons to conspire to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any person of any state, territory or district in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him/her by the Constitution or the laws of the United States, or because of his/her having exercised the same.[2]  Under United States law, it is the express duty of all officers of the law or individuals such as security guards, legislators, mayors, Council Persons, judges, Hospitals and Nursing Home Proprietors, etc., to protect and preserve an individual's constitutional rights Under Title 18, U.S.C., Section 242 - Deprivation of Rights Under Color of Law. Most of these individuals take oaths to uphold the US Constitution. It is clearly a violation of federal law for these individuals to violate people's constitutional or civil rights under the color of the law.[3]
Are you ever in the ATL area

Nice!!!  The guy who dedicated the song to his mom! Love it. I recognized the guy from Foreigner, and his daughter has a lovely voice
you have made me feel so much positive about people that with your help I can get through the dark winter here in the north (Finland) as long as you don't stop making these videos at your own pace of course . We in Finland need a lot of happiness for the winter so that we can survive. Could I get you here even for one moment to give us your light in the middle of the darkness? And of course the other Nordic countries also need this kind of energy =)
New to your channel... just subscribed. Enjoyed all the singers.
Very nice! I loved the young lady’s rendition of September. Her voice was beautiful and soulful. I love Foreigner.🤩😎

Not sure why this popped up in my feed, but I subscribed based on this one video, 3 totally different people.Awesome.The young man singing for his mom💜pulled at my heart strings. Behind the nerves is an amazing voice. The twins were fun. The singer at the end killed with her own version of September. I'm so glad she stopped. First glimpse at her father I thought to myself he looks like a rock star. Lo & behold! ✌🏾🤩
Wow those young boys!!
A mother never gets tired of waiting for their kids to return home.hope you are ok with her now. May you all be showered with lots of blessings.
Pray they both find a room in their hearts to start loving each other once more. And to rekindle their relationship with a sense of forgiveness and love.
Christopher you voice is amazing. Hope your mom is able to see this.
Esperamos voce nas ruas do Brasil...venha brother .
From Canada.....LOVE this video......spreading love and joy.....we need more people like this
They all sang beautifully!❤🔥🔥🔥🔥
I’d most like to hear the chick that’s my age & played with Foreigner!!!  That’s good stuff they did!  ROCK ON! 🎷🎸
Hartstikke leuk bedankt man 👍
Wow 'm in tears. Christopher sang with raw emotion from his heart. As a grandma with a son; life can be complicated.
Cayleigh👍👍♥️, good job Reggie 🙏
Awesome London United Kingdom

Foreigner -  fabulous band!  Daughter - fabulous vocals! Hope the young man gets to reconcile with his mother, he's so sincere - bless him.  The rwins are such lovely guys too. Thanks again for a great video. 😊❤
Living in New Zealand 🇳🇿 you are a highly motivated talented musician with skills that you share with the public.  Your allure is your voice. The tone and beckoning is so friendly. You bring out THE BEST in all of them. What an absolute JOY. 😂😊❤

The Elvis singing young man was so  pleasant to hear. All these people have such great singing voices. The September lady rocked it😂
Should be more Reggies' in the world.
The first kid broke my heart. I pray he mends it with mom. The teen years are so rough. I loved the sweet twins. Rock Royalty’s daughter was amazing! I loved it too much. I wish we had more people like you in the world. 😊
I knew Cayleigh's dad looked familiar!!!  I may have aged myself......
This young man don't even know that he can really sing well 🎉

BRAVO for the twins🎉
Elvis guy draws you in
I love all of the singing especially the fact that they all did classic songs.
Girl singing september is rocking tht song!!
Just beautiful
Reggie you're one AWESOME GUY! Love watching ALL your videos!💯☝️🎸
That was great
girl who sing september really rock it❤❤❤
Can we just take a moment to appreciate that  those two young boys chose a song from the 80s.... Heck all the people were amazing. .how cool is it when your dad was a member of foreigner.. you were amazing young lady.
You made my day, thank you so much. You bring joy to people and the world. 🌏 🙏❤🤗
Cayleigh rocked it!
Tears & chills!
Haha well done twins
Cayleigh was great. She takes after her dad musically. Wonderful job making it her own.
Boy, I didn't even recognize September...very interesting interp.
Reggie pitches things up for higher voices. An intuitive musician. The twins will remember forever.💓
Awesome❤❤❤
She could play Meryl Streep’s double!
Well done.
I truly enjoyed hearing Cayle sing September 😊
Omg, everyone that dang wad amazing! The 21 year old who sang for his mother, the kid Asian twin boys, and Cayleigh, the soulful singer raised in a musical rock band family. That was so great! Ty Reggie too! I've seen quite a few of your videos, bit singing for your parents is a great idea. Reggie you're so funny when you asked the twins where they met, and then said in the womb, and then their reactions, ha ha ha.
She was absolutely amazing
Omg, that guy is from the band Foreigner. Also, I've never heard anyone refer to Earth Wind and Fire as EWF until just now. Interesting.
Reggae you are such a nice man!
Young man go and hug y😊ur mom
I smiled through this entire video
Foreigner used to be one of my favourite band. Cayleigh is so lucky to have a dad who is so famous and humble
Awesome...
l love.      this❤
Am watching it today, 1st September so it's not a bad idea. Thank you.
Cayleigh, you rock. Great family
First time seeing your videos Reggie, wonderful. And you have a great heart,nice man
The lady has a awesome voice
I love every foreigner song!!!
When i heard chorus effect i knew it was this song. Oddly enough the tipping point was in my mind.
Funny I'm watching this 1st of September how about that...
I really liked HER jazzy version. Didn't recognize the song at first❤
OMG I'm dying Good Job Reggie...
The first young man did a pop version and killed it. The twins very outgoing and brave did a good job. WoW September? Hell yeah she kicked that song up and down that street! Awesome as always Mr. Reggie. God bless you for doing this. Yee Haw by Sing with Reggie for free! RED WHITE AND BLUE NECK
Wow! Love her version of September Great voice!❤❤❤
I love this, everyone was amazing but Caleigh _ a star is born. Beautiful voice 🎉❤
Nice video!
I gotta say it again, AWESOME 👏🏾 ❤
Caitlyn girl you can sing!!!! 😊
This is awesome!!!!!! ❤
🙏🏿🙏🏿 for the good Lord to heal the young man relationship with his mom ❤
🥰🥰 I love this,  Reggie you make me happy ❤
SEPTEMBER is my favorite song. Her version is beautiful 🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Christopher has a gorgeous voice.  The twins did fantastic.
Awesome,that’s absolutely makes my first day of September  wonderful ❤❤❤❤ thanks Reggie always watching you here in Melbourne but originally I’m from Philippines ❤
YOU ARE GODS PEOPLE!!!!! I JUST LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOUR IDEA HERE. WHAT A BEAUTIFUL WAY TO BOND WITH US!!!!! THANK YOU ALWAYS.
That was STUPENDOUS!!!
You should come to Dallas ❤
You go girl. You made September rock ❤
❤❤❤
I just love y’all  energy together and she can sang🎼🎤🎸
Cayleigh went for it & her Dad is in the band Foreigner which is cool!!  🤗 The twins were confident young boys! Christopher was cute singing his Mother’s song ! ❤️ Reggie you are so kind to strangers I wish we had more kindness on our Earth & not greed! 💙👍Cheers from Australia 🍻🇦🇺
Reggie you are always awesome! Thank you for your light🌸
I like it how your face shines, when the singer has a good voice.
Just a little band....  FOREIGNER!   ❤
First guy beautiful voice😊😊
Well done! Love you Reggie.
Yay!! Very proud of them both
Wow the twins killed
Reggie, you are unbelievable guitar player!  Thanks for your talent and your street wise personality!  Liberty was fabulous!  Greetings from the Seattle area!
Twins, i love that song! You did amazing!  And, young lady you have a beautiful voice!
Hope to meet you soon Reggie
Weight lifted, momma knows hiw much you love her! Especially dedicated one of her favorire songs to her. 😢 thats a happy cry!
I hope his Mom sees him live and they patch their differences up. Time on Earth is too short to fight.
Wow, I really dislike Elvis, but man, this version? I'm gonna have to listen to this one again! I love the way people stopped to listen <3
COMENTÁRIO BRASILEIRO: A menina do titanic canta muitooooo.     the girl them titanic sing much
Cayleighs dad is in Foreigner!! "I've-been-waiiittting-for-a-girl-like-you" Foreigner? Yahoo! ❤ Cayleigh was phenomenal ♥️
They all did very good! The last lady tore it up!  Nice cover of the EW&F classic.
Nice young man,lovely song!❤
Floods of tears ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Bloody little uns.....❤❤❤❤
Everyone did great. But the last young lady who sang was freaking awesome !🦋🍎
Foreigner ROCkS!!!!😁😁   oh wow! and Cayleigh does too!  Go girl!!
ive been in a really bad mood lately. Ive seen a few of these before but today I clicked on one and now i just cant stop watching. made my whole week better.
Reggie   I love your beautiful spirit   You sound and act as areal loving person    You are awesome  Love what you say and do  Really genuine    Love In Christ  😊😊🐝🐝💪❤️
You making me cry young man very good
Christopher is such a nice person.
Love that song! Loved him 2!
A guy singing from his heart, two kids having fun and a star. Really good and heartwarming sequence
❤
Cayleigh knows her way around a melody 🎶
Life is too short to let anything come between you and your children...you and your mom.  Nothing is promised for tomorrow... One day it will be too late to repair a broken bridge.  Then you have to live with that part of your soul...in ruins.  Let today be the day to work on the bridge, tomorrow could be too late. It may not matter much today, but on one of the many tomorrows...the pain and regret becomes mega real. 🙏🏼❤
Cayleigh... WOW 🔥🔥🔥 excellent song choice. EWF. Solid family bond with music 🫶🏾 Titanique
She did a great job ❤
@cayleigh.capaldi you can better sing then he is on quitar 😄👍🏻
Reggie, you are great! Keep on doing this. You do good. You spread happiness, joy and good vibes.
Cayleigh vocal is amazing. ❤
Tears flow. Prayers that he and his mom reunites.💖
Cool to see kids rocking Tears for Fears.
She was great and gull of joy
This is super amazing
Super! ❤💛
Loved the twins! An older song!
The kids were adorable. First guy...bless him.
Usually that key she is sings in is annoying, but the way she sang it was nice and bright. SEPTEMBER is so hard to sing anyway, I actually appreciated her rendition. Nice to hear it through FRESH eyes. I loved how FOREIGNER legend was secure with himself to just stand back and support her. Only insecure folk hog the space and suck all the air out of a room.
Love watching!Linda Bahlmann,Cincinnati!😊
SOUL SOUL SOUL yes lord when u got it no one can take it From You  Good Job MOM and DAD 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰💯🔥🔥🔥🔥🥰🥰🥰🥰
That was so sweet.
that lady can sang
We were touched to this Sweet Little Innocent BELOVED Gentelman How he Song to His Mother Falling in Love Seriously was MIND BLOWING GOD BLESS U (BIG HUG KISS❤) And hat Off to ur Great Mother that had a Son Like U
another super job Reggie!
The 1st Elvis song is called Fools Rush In! OMG, Foreigner was my 1st concert in ‘76! Yet, that awesome Foreigner Tom wasn’t in the band until the 90s.
How sweet that this young man dedicated the Elvis song to his mom. I hope things get better between him and his mom.
I am glad Cayleigh stayed to sing, but that was just riding the previous performance adrenaline.... I am sure her parents were getting some food into her very soon! Still, a very nice encore, and a ridiculously talented professional singing from her heart.
Loved all the singers Reggie, ty for sharing; but the girl that sang September was amazingly good, made this old man's yes leak, and joy; just made me happy... Ty mam, and ty Reggie you bring a lamp of joy into this world, no politics❤💯🙏, no debates just love of music and song! from SE Texas Bear
When I see these people come up all I can think is they probably are great ppl with a lot of friends or ppl with no friends at all 😔
Great job twins
BRAVO
I love that song by Elvis.  I look at the movie Blue Hawaii just to hear the song.
You are so wonderful, not only do these people sing but people love it. ❤❤❤
Wow, what a jam
Kaylee was outstanding & her voice was seriously on point. Everyone else was also enjoyable & did a great job.
OK MY MIND  IS  BLOWN WERE DID THESE LITTLE  TWINS  KNOW  ABOUT  THAT SONG 🎵  .IT'S  SO  BEFORE  THEIR TIME 😮😮 OMG 😱.
Amazing! Everyone was great!! Love you!
Everybody wants to rule the world, I could agree more. Specially the good for nothing wants to rule everybody else
You have all the lessons from your parents and friends on how to be or not to be.Your 21 and now responsible for your own life. Fly free and say THIS is me.
This should be a weekly show on TV.  Someone should call jimmy kimmel...
Damm, I miss my mom. She passed last October.
65 years old and someone is cutting onions near me.
Oh, you know, just a little band known as FOREIGNER - the humbleness of that man sheesh
Today I decided to only watch positive uplifting videos as I worked so I spent my entire day watching guitar5000... 🙂
Omg the young man made me cry and the other two boys remind me of my 7 year old he loves that song
Loved all the singers but the last girl's voice is REDICULOUS! 🤯 I enjoyed that so much! ❤
Good on you for doing this for THEM! Bravo dude 👏🎭❤️🇦🇺✨️
Daughter of Foreigner father was way cool.
Wow Kayleigh, what an awesome voice! Great job! xoxo
That was one of the best September. What a voice, so much soul. Loved it.
It might be heartfelt but he can't sing Elvis to save his life.
Great job Christopher! xoxo
Very cool.  but did nobody else decide to stop the video to get a good look at the hot blonde walking by 2 minutes into the first song?
Awesome everyone. All you guys rock. Nice singing. Love you Reggie.  You make everyone so comfortable. Keep shining. Music makes us happy. Love the way September was sang . Love her runs. One of my cardio workout song. ❤️
Cayleigh has a very beautiful voice with various range that I really loved and she made it her own.  The others were good too.
❤I love your videos ❤ just continue 💋
September got some fancy footworks there
Lovely ....enjoyed it and the street audience....❤
I love Reggie and how he shares his gifts with humanity.  Thank you, Reggie, for always making my day better❤️
I wish the guy all the best!
Jason and Justin you both sang with confidence and you both did great with tone and projection. Thank you for singing with Reggie. I hope you both continue to sing. 🎤🎤
Genuinely like who Reggie gathers around him. Just good vibes, singers and community 🎉🎉  One of the few bright spots on the internet ❤
Cayleigh killed, she’s a good singer ❤ thank you for stopping girl
This young teenager on white short dedicated to his mom is really humble and loving kid
Dude your an undercover angel spreading the love 👍
Loved the twins, Justin and Jason! They are super cute and so smart!❤
Really cool what you do for people. Many walking by in their own worlds not realizing how much life can offer if they took notice of it.
I'm a mom and I forgive him.❤
And Cayleigh's father and mother are Domenick Allen Capaldi and 2013 Olivier Award wining actress Leigh Zimmerman.
Christopher is so sweet. God bless him. Pray that Christopher and his mom reconciles.😥😥 The two boys were cute! ❤️💞Cayleigh,s got a great voice ! ❤Reggie is so warm and friendly..God bless you Reggie.❤❤👍🏻🙏🙏
Miss September  is a professional  singer nice!!Free mini  concert!!Free!@Good work🎉🎉🎉🎉and 👍👍👍
Reggie... you are the best non-toxic buzz ever!!
I can't believe the young twins knew that old classic song!
Reggie, the gift you give to humanity is so beautiful, so simple but so mighty. Music is a blessing for us all. There will be crowns for you in heaven.
Im.shooketh thiese little kids chose tears for fears
it's Amazing what you do, thank you for sharing your talent with everyone. ❤❤❤
Awesome
September rendition is amazing! she is pro.
Imagine our world if we all sang. Thank you Reggie!
Le micro 'est pas branché !
The world needs more Regies.
Really dig seeing you spread the love. It’s just amazing to watch what you bring out of people. Some surprise me others leave me in wonder
That Lady that sang September is also awesome.
I love that these kids know and appreciate music way before their generation. Good music knows no bounds.
The twins are so cute.
New subscriber,Reggie👏🤩😍🙏 ☮️💟🇵🇭🇺🇸🇨🇱
👏🤩😍🙏🥰 ☮️💟
Reggie, you are a great soul indeed. Proud to have you in our human race. Your service is awesome dear.
She is the the real deal!!!
Love the twins !!
What a lovely guy...and I fell in love with him , Jen from Australia
The world needs more people like Reggie,
The last young lady singing,she was great. Loved it.
One of Foreigner happens to be passing by, that’s mad. Did you know the band Reggie?
I hope his mom sees this. Hope she loves it and hope they work things out too.
Reggie you give such an amazing opportunity to people ❤gifted
I thought dad looked familiar! Wow that last girl had so much positive energy, beautiful voice!!
How great you are. Fun the people you meet . Great job guys.❤
Love it. Great job.
❤
WOW, what a talented young woman & her Dad & Mon seem like wonderful people... what a great Family!!!❣🥰❣
Young lady can sing!
no one flinched when the band name foreigner was dropped wth lol
That was so beautiful. So touching .
Dude - Foreigner? Nice!
That first kid honestly could be really good. It was nervousness and shyness but you could tell when he was riffin' a bit that he's got talent.
Such a lovely young man, l wanted to give him a hug, hopefully things with his mum can be resolved ❤ life is short
here’s Cayleigh singing with his father  https://youtu.be/6tYJg47fZRI?si=h3CoV-Bwf77Dxepc
🙏❤❤😮😂❤❤🎉👍🤙
♥️♥️♥️♥️👍🤙🤗♥️♥️♥️♥️
She has so much soul in her voice. I got chills. I loved her September.
❤
Thoroughly enjoyed the young men singing !!😊
Now this is such a great service. Everyone was great. They honestly I’ll give me chills, and that girl at the end can really sing! Her parents inspire me
Wowwwwww young lady great singer!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤
The first young man was awesome. If he were my son I'd be so proud! I am anyway for his courage. So glad he chose to sing! The two kids were great, too!!! Very amazed they knew the song!!! Love it!
The young man who sung Elvis was amazing he sung from the ❤️
Wow, ¡Qué hermoso canta Cayleigh Capaldi! me encantó la sencillez y humildad de su padre, reconocido  rock star de Foreigner. Saludos Cordiales desde Monterrey Nuevo León México.
1.  The first boy was a really hurt person.  He definitely needed a friend right at that moment.  Best wishes to him, having problems with your own mother is the most complicated thing to cope with. 2.  The kids later on were just a charm on arranging their separate parts.  They should have been encouraged to finish the whole song. 3.  Cayliegh would have been a nice idea to sing C. Dion.  It'd have made much more sense.  All of them def amazing!
September was lovely.
Reggie, you rock! You are such a wonderful person! Keep it up!
Wow Foreigner's guitarist daughter. And she loves Earth wind and fire. This is how life is supposed to be. That says a lot for the respect of a star guitarist to love EWF. 🔥🔥🔥🔥❤ Two thumbs up
Wow.... Cayleigh's dad plays for Journey!!! It was pretty cool to have them randomly walk by, let alone stop!! Obviously talent runs in the family. The daughter had a beautiful voice and pulled off September beautifully!!
Sweet!
Foreigner one of the great bands!  The best was what a gracious and joyful daughter he raised.  Thank you.
Awww Christopher was wonderful! 👏
That girl of September has a voice!!! 👏👏👏👏
This is how humans are supposed to act ❤❤❤❤I love this😊
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽Great Video ! Reggie is a blessing
That woman sang EWF!!Had me all caught up.Perfect fun time song!
September was great!!!!
I love this getting  singers for free 🎉❤
He is sweet young man good on him.
❤❤❤😢 I hope mom heard this
FOREIGNER???????!!!!!! I would have  been sooooooooooo happy..... My alltime favorite band ever!!!!! BUT Kaleigh is   amazing!!! apple didnt fall far from the tree!❤
❤ That young man who sang Elvis song, you touch my heart. I hope all the best for him and his mom. Hope I can hear you sing again.❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Young guy, you should try. American got talent
That lady at the end was fire!! That improvisation was crazy! Actually everybody was amazing!
Love this guy,there was a lot of people from different nation but this never stopped them. Love each other stop racism ❤
What a beautiful video! Every single one of them was awesom!!!😃
Mugshot heard round the world...President Trump is officially a Rockstar ❤🇺🇸🇺🇸
Reggie is one of best humans on the net!  How do I feel after someone sings? I want to jump through the screen and hug them...and Reggie!!!🤗  💞  🎶        🎸😮💓

Thanks again reggie love what you do in this crazy way the world is atm your videos always brighten my  day ❤❤❤
Omg so she's so amazing and the young man so sweet to his mom
They were all great. The last young lady rocked it. Beautiful voice. And to top it off her dad is a member of my most all time favorite bands!!. Foreigner was here in Hawaii a few years back and I missed the show (sick). I was so bummed.  Saw them in the 80's though. Earth Wind and Fire too. That was fun. Thank you all!
😁👋👍👍👏👏💕🙏🏻 All were my favorite. I smiled all the way through. Thank you to you and all the singers.
So cool!
I am sure that September will stay with me for the whole day!
12:52... Cómo mola ! Me flipa ...
which band member was that? Thanks Reggie enjoyed all the singers the twins and the young guy. Thank you.
Great job twin brother
I hope Chrisphers mother sees this there not getting on but he still loves mum enough to sing this song just for her 💗💔💗
I love my beby cute claire😊👍
I just love Reggie’s open heart and his sense of humanity toward others. He always brings out the best in people and leaves them feeling good about themselves and the world. And Christopher, how lucky your mom is. You knocked it out of the park.
Loved this segment, the young man who sang the Elvis tune, really touching. Hope his Mom saw this. The twins so adorable, a perfect song.  The young lady has an awesome voice, very beautiful.  Sir, thank you for sharing your videos as to show there are many beautiful people that live to express themselves with both song and their voice. ❤❤❤🥀🎵
Hi, what guitar pedal effect do you use.
brilliant
thank you thank you thank you, Reggie You are the bomb  Keep up the great work
Christopher  I would call her and sing that song for her. You made me cry  because you sang beautifully from your ❤️.
This was awesome Reggie, 😊! Don’t stop bringing people together through music. It’s the heartbeat of everybody!
First kid was brutal
Great job kids
I hope young Christopher sees this: make up with mom, never go to bed angry. My mom and I were arguing when she died, I never got to make things right. It is okay to disagree, but always let her know you love her.
Cayleigh, wonderful voice and a great performer👍
That’s awesome! It’s all about your customers! I would have been OMG I LOVE FOREIGNER and gone nuts! But it was about his daughter and her show night & singing with you! She did shine! Respect to you and her parents ! ❤ P.S. My high school in Munich Germany sang with Foreigner in the 80s, whatever town Foreigner was playing they would get a school chorus to sing with them in concert! ❤
I really think this young guy sings really good hes just shy
Keep making people feel better about themselves that’s so cool
Christopher that was beautiful, I hope you sort things with your mum, bless you. Twinnies you were so cute! Last lady, apologies I forget your name, music is definately in your blood girl! What a voice! xx
Damn that September rendition was awesome. Great job 👌👌👌
That was cool.
That’s awesome 👏 👏👏👏♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
She can sing ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Beautiful voice love it ❤💕💕💕💕💕♥️👍👏👏👏
This is beautiful ❤
Reggie I love your channel!! It is a breath of fresh air!!
Elvis, good choice
God bless you Reggie, lot of love from Puerto Rico 🙏🏻🇵🇷💪🏻
Proud of you Christopher
Cayleigh Capaldi! Amazing!

Little man it was very good. Hope you and mom work it out 🙏
First Dude is soft!!
These boys are THE BEST <3
Cayleigh is great singer and what a great thing to have a Dad from legendary band Foreigner ...
Cayleigh gal you rock, I loved that. You did the song justice. Big up to you.
Dear Reggie, first of all I hope I spelled your name right, and then: Thank you! Listening to you and your "street catches" has often made me cry a little - just too beautiful. Love. But now, as an (apparently) ignoramus, I would like to share: I know some wonderful and beautiful big cities in Europe, even Buenos Aires I learned to love very (very!), but what I realised through your videos is: New York is also a bit of everything beautiful. Not only skyscrapers and metal and glass and concrete, but this special street beauty and also many European roots. Maybe I (just over 58) should definitely experience NY live again (and maybe sing with you)... A big thank you from Cologne from Marion
I loved it as a mother from a son!!!! Thanks! I’ll pretend it was for me from my son! You will work it out bc you have heart!
All who sang were sooo awesome! And the twins are so cute!
Lovely twins ❤
The cute babies singing my fave song by tears for fears!!!
Liebe 😍 geht raus, from 🇩🇪 ♥, well done Bro

My goodness Cayleigh! Girl, you can SANG! The riffs and runs were on point! Excellent timing, great pitch and tone! Everyone else was also great! Wonderful episode!
Wow! 👏👏 to all that sang, especially the last one! Reggie, any chance you might swing by San Francisco?

Christopher, you melt every mother's heart today.  Your mom must be a wonderful woman.
How special is this. This is the way life should be. Enjoying each other and having fun. Chillin' and Singin' in the streets. Nice job SIR REGGIE and all who sing with him. Be save and keep on bringing some joy to this old wotld. GOD bless and keep you and yours. In JESUS name, Amen 🙏
Hello, I am Luigi, Yahoo!
Cayleigh is a great singer!
Hats off to you Reggie. While the world seems to be crumbling around us you are spreading Joy , Love and Unity  among strangers. You are an ambassador of Peace. Love your attitude and personality. You are an Awesome human being. Blessings to you and yours. Thank You so much. You make my day!!!!🤙🏼👏👏👏👏👏
Reggie, you make people dig deep to find their true emotions. Thank you for helping these people out!
Reggie you are a beautiful human being.  You give those who want to sing a chance to sing.  Blessings to you and your music.
When are you coming to ga here in Waycross we have a lot of singers a friend of mine has a site he calls brick yard productions we have a lot of people who would come sing for you old and young we would love it
Bravo for courage. Cheers from Poland.
Love it.🤟
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤Everyone is so good.😂
I love all the blessed, beautiful, brave singers! So much gifts and talents from adults and children!🙏🎤🎼🎵🙂
Awesome 👌 😊🎉❤
Wow Reggie what a video, you have the opportunity to meet beautiful and important people too.
Cayleigh is a SINGER! Great performance Cayleigh, you killed it, as a professional singer level performer...outstanding!
gday christopher mate  love that you did a elvis song and ya mum  iam sure would be proud as..cheers from oz
Christopher...you can sing bro...so SING! Sing for your Mom, sing for your Grandma, have someone record you singing, and share what you can do with others and make them feel some joy. ;)
Hope the young guy will make up with his mom❤
OMG!! She’s a good singer looks like professional oh yes September!
Missed this...shame..so good. You gotta love a kid who shows his love for his mom. The twins were adorable...first 10 year o😢ld (?) who sings bass. 😂  The young lady proves genes make a difference in musical talent. 👌 Still think about Santeria Brittany...by far one of the best performances I ever watched.  Hope she and her family are well and happy. Cheers from Wisconsin 🍺 😊
OMG, Foreigner, 70s legend! I thought he looked familiar...barely aged, amazing!
11:28 So, the person you point out there is not Domenick Allan (Cayleigh's dad). That's Bruce Watson. Domenick's claim to being a member of Foreigner is - a little nebulous. Not really sure what the real deal is, but seems at most he maybe played a couple of gigs as a vocal stand in during the 90s. Don't know how true it is. All I know is I can't find any audio or video that is actually of Domenick in the band.
Awesome🎉❤
What lovely singers.  The last one - that's a difficult song to sing and she did it effortlessly
Simply sweet and awesome!!!
Hello Reggie, I love you, you are wonderful, keep fulfilling your dream, I am praying for you. God blessings and protection over you and your crew💕😘
What I appreciate about Cayleigh is that even though she's professional and obviously very talented, she actually manages to avoid oversinging the song while still showing off what she's got. A lot of the big jumps actually sound more like her jumping around to find a comfortable register in a song that's in the original key for a male voice that sings half of it in falsetto.
Is it my Birthday? a Foreigner's member (his daughter, i know), Earth Wind and Fire song in guitaro?? Cannot be better than these..love the first 3 performers too (Christopher and the twins)..
The twins are absolutely adorable ❤
Chris was amazing, but somebody needs to tell these kids to stop covering the end of the goddamn mic with their hands!. Ruins the sound and hides all those gorgeous harmonics in your voice like they're under a damp cloth! Mics are designed this way for a reason, leet it make your voice shiiiine!
now, she brings the night over...this is the reason why I enjoy street chillin. Singers like her and talented musicians.
Love the young guy with the blue t-shirt,  he gave me goosebumps ❤
Christopher is a really good singer!
Love the Foreigner and EWF❤
The Twins sang a Great Song…”Everybody Wants to Rule the World 🗺️ “.  I love all the singers…they’re full of Charisma, Excellent Attitude and positive energy.  Thank you Reggi.
someone from Foreigner just walking down the street after leaving an off Broadway show, how cool. Cayleigh is a good singer to.
I love this young man he needs his Mom  I hope every thing is good for the family ❤
That girl is awesome, her energy is contagious!!
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Defenitely Cayleigh Capaldi.. Dad should know where and how to guide her. She's a star in the making.
good idea live in YouTube bro ❤
Wow!!!
man ur videos always make me smile. the first guys was good and the kids were so cute and u just got to fist bump an actual rock legend! <3 dont stop spreading the music <3
Foreigner who sang "I wanna know what love is" ? 🤯 crazy.
Aww that was the best! All of them. I love what you do Reggie🤗💚
Damn. She.Did.That🎉 Cayleigh😮
The twins confidence🎉
Dear Mom of Christopher,. your son is such a loving soul, you can be very proud of him. All the best for you both❤️
Cayleigh is an absolute an amazing singer!!!
Hello Chris and Reggie  . Chris I hope your Mother was listening . She still loves you . And you love her . Did a fantasy job on singing . Mom you have raised a fantastic Son.❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
Makes me  happy to watch and hear them sing...music is everything...
I'm always smiling when I watch you Guitaro :)
Chris should take his voice seriously. That kind of voice is a money maker.
Christopher, I hope that your mom sees this. As a mom with an estranged child, my heart hurts for you & your mom. I'm saying a prayer & keeping the faith that you'll find your way back to soft words & hugs for one another. Even at 21, you're still her baby. Keep singing!
You have done some great.. I mean, fantastic podcasts, and this one was really super.
I love Reggie! You are amazing!
The young lady voice is amazing. She reminds me of Yebba . But she’s has  a Style of her Own 💃🏼👠👠👏👏
I pray all goes well for the other young man that him and his mother will be on wonderful loving terms and the twin boys were marvelous. It’s really wonderful Reggie what you are doing out there in the world. God bless you.
need more of this then world will be better.
Something about this one was extra wholesome! Thank you for all you do Reggie! I know it can't be easy at times,  but you're on a mission just to make people happy. its nice to see.
Cayleigh!! Wow blessed to have a musician dad and her vocals are through the roof
Wow, guitarist from Foreigner, Elvis the Twins..and EW&F  a good haul my man!
Wow that first boy has a beautiful voice . Such an old soul maybe reincarnated from 1940s.
The lads even adapted the handshake. Slick
I miss my son dearly. We are not on good terms also. I hope he comes back soon. 😢
Wonderful!!!!!
The first young man was AWESOME. I sure hope his mother sees this video, and opens up her heart. The twins were amazing, get the two of them in singing lessons...they have natural talent. The third singer, the gal with the GORGEOUS hair, definitely got her amazing talent from her family. 🤩🥰😍
Love Caleigh Capaldi, soooo good
Hello
Jason and Justin are great
Love, love, love this whole video from the beginning to the end.
You guys continue to amaze people, you never know who will show up to the microphone, continue to make us smile.
Christopher is fantastic; I love that he dedicated this song to his mother!
Wow KALIEGH…… twins oooohhhh so sweet  First boy so fine  THANKYOU all  THANKYOU Teggie
I love Elvis!! When my oldest grandson was at Valeska Hinton, and his teacher asked if any of the children knew who Elvis was; he stood up, said , " my Grandma loves Elvis", did an Elvis dance, and sang this song!
Thumbs up for Gittaro! Reggie you have such amazing talents!!! You are truly a gift to us all 💝  thank you!
Mate if your ever in Perth Australia I'd love to sing with you. I can't sing for shit but I love to sing and make people happy.
The fact that the boy showed he missed his mom. Professed his love for her, and said I'm sorry in-between the lines. That made me smile! ❤
Excellent…
Awesome rendition. ❤ uniqueness
Cayleigh was awesome! Extremely talented! Definitely inherited genius musicality. Woohoo! 🙌 😁 👍
I couldn’t help it but 😭! When this young man sang I want it to hug him . I pray things work out for him with mom!🙏🥰♥️
Loved the September singer
That was great.  The professional Cayleigh interpretation is awesome.  🎉❤
wow - what a voice Caleigh has!
I loveeeee September; ITS my favorite song of alllllll times…..well I’m a disco man 😅
The twins singing Tears for Fears 😊
THIS WAS INCREDIBLE....!!! E.W.F. ONE OF THE GREATEST GROUPS IN MUSIC HISTORY....!!!AWESOME...OUTSTANDING JOB....!!!👍👍🙏🙏✌✌😎😎
Wow she is awesome ❤
The Elements of the Universe are ALWAYS right for the occasion.  Fun show!  Thanks to all the singers and Reggie!
Bravo...to you Reggie for giving these parents of the Artist  smiles on the faces the parents look so proud of their babies. All of you are so amazing. Again ...BRAVO! 👌
This video makes me feel so happy that I almost forgot to click the like button :)
Damn i'm a twin and i'm 6 minutes older than my brother but these guys are half a minute apart that's crazy
The twins are so cool  they sing good 👍
Two songs from Gaurdians of the Galaxy Cosmic Rewind. Love it!
Nailed it, Christopher! Deep soulful voice
Hi Hi hello you’re so pretty
Jesus Christ died for our sins was buried and rose again the third day. I hope all who reads this will realize your a sinner (we all are) and turn to Jesus and trust and believe that He died for your sins was buried and rose again the third day but trust in Him alone to save you from your sins and hell.
Wow beautiful
Christopher, Thank you. I am tearing up. You have an amazing voice. I love watching Reggie and the different people who sing with him. God bless you, I hope you and your mum work things out, but I also admire your grandma for sheltering you. Thank you !
You are such a beautiful soul💙 Music can connect the world, one song at a time, and you are doing just that 😊🥰
The girl so good to singing~~~   WOW
First song made me miss my morher. She passed 3 and a half years ago and we talked regularly, but i wish we had talked more.
Thank you for having made my headache disappear.
Wow she is a star
Keep up the good work Reggie. You make many people happy, the singers and the people who watch your channel. I was in NYC in 1988, doing sightseeing, on holiday from graduate study at Syracuse Univ, School of Educ, Dept of IDD&E.  Greetings from Indonesia.
Excellent!!!...I'm gonna meet you one day and sing a song for my Grandaughter , Olivia Rose!!, My heart!!! Don't ever stop this. I love music 4 life!!!
11:49 That was surprising, nice voice
Nice.
Everyone who participated was awesome. I really loved the 2 twins, and they were too cute and smart 😍
Christopher, I hope your Mom sees this.  😉 ❤️
I’m gonna pray for the young man who wasn’t in communication with his mom. It was clear he was hurting. Poor thing. I sure hope they work it out.  The twins were adorable, and the lady who sang September was excellent. I’m not so sure Reggie recognized the band name Foreigner though. Lol.   Dad was a true rock star!
=) hacer feliz a la gente con una canción
Ok
Twins?  I''d have called them identical strangers who by some coincidence could both sing the same song!
Reggie....I would love to sing with you!! You should come to Colorado Springs!!!  A lot of grouchy people here....maybe you could cheer them up lol!!!
White girl has soul.
The only thing Kayleigh has in common with Celine Dion, is the nose. The Elvis song young man, though, got the essence of the song by diving straight into people's hearts. Hopefully things work out for him. If not, the Chinese family can adopt him. I'm sure Jason and Justin would love to have an older brother.
You're a good dude.
Great job!❤❤❤
Awesome true positive content !! Bravo Reggie !!!!
The interaction with Cayleigh and her family was so great. She was great, and her mom and dad were awesome. He didn't bring up Foreigner until pressed. Then their daughter knocked it out of the park. Christopher and  the twins, Jason and Justin, were magnificent as well, sublime  in different ways. Thanks for keeping your heart open and serving, Guitaro.
Proud mama of those twins. ❤
Twins so cute ❤
💕 So great! Thank y'all for making me smile!
I feel like Under Pressure by Bowie and Queen would have been more appropriate for the last song.🤣🤣🤣
Cayliegh’s voice is amazing.  Great vocal range .  She did September justice.
Great vibes with the foreigner crew...
Dedicated to his mom...nothing sweeter. Go home and tell your mom you love her. You will beg for 1 more minute if god forbid something happens to her. Please just do it. I would give anything for another moment with my father, I love him so much.💔
Sending hugs to Chris
The first young man to sing DOES have talent, and should pursue a career in singing!!!
I love that you help us to hear beautiful human voices  with each video you post. ! Its a rare person that cant sound beautiful when they sing.. Hearing beautiful singing is as near taking a drug to me as I ever get with out actually doing so...
wow the girl who sing ‘do yo remember’ definitely is good singer
Apparently, they don’t let you live in NYC unless you can sing. Wowsa!
Wow!!!
Aqui é Brasil só acha talento mano é nois
I wish it was that way with everyone in this world.  Coming together, different races, having fun, happy....that's the way it should be.
Great.  I love your channel. What App do you use to find the guitar tabs and songs? Thanks
I love these videos so much, but low-key I was kind of annoyed that even after the kids tell him they only speak English, he's still gotta try and get them to speak Chinese with him. He's also purely guessing that they're Chinese, they could've been Korean for all he knows. Like it's not about you trying to show off your language skills just chill, it comes off as less cultured rather than more
2:0q You see that ?
You're doing really great, people have fun and enjoy it, great Video 👍👍👍👍👍👍🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🎁🎁🎁🎁🎁🎁🎁🎁
LOVE seeing/hearing young kids singing the Greats.
Wow great singers!!
The lady at end gave me chills, I’d go pay to see her 🎶 thanks Reggie your awesome 👏 👏😂😁
Sniff, sniff ❤
Just, thank you for your input into the universe.. it’s quite divine..
💚
Blessed  boys. Loved you....
❤❤❤I hope his MOM KNOWS how special Christopher , he is a star ⭐️ on the risen ❤❤❤
💜💜💜💜💯💥
Wow CAYLEIGH CAPALDI  🔥❤️‍🔥🔥 What a pro!
What about everyone touching that same mike and getting their germs all over it? Isn't that a little dangerous and careless during these times?
Those twins are giving me smile wrinkles
I hope his mom sees that.
The twins are adorable
💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯👏👏👏👏👏👏👏💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🇺🇾🇧🇷
Foreigner is one of my favorite bands and for Dad to just hang back and let her take the stage that is really awesome
Uhuuuuu!
Reggie always bring out the best in people...Great playing Reg!🎶🎸
AWESOME...young lady at the end has a soulful voice.  Loved the fella in the beginning dedicating the song to his mom, bless his relationship with his mom...the twins were sweet.
BIG WOW
Everyone was great
Very heartwarming video....toucing.
Thank you Reggie for making so many people happy who love to sing!! Can you come to Worcester, Massachusetts.
She's terrific...fun!
The twins, Jason & Justin, were adorable ❤❤.  Loved that the young lady’s parents had grandma on FaceTime. Music really does connect us. This channel is awesome❤!
The woman that sang September, was awesome, she can sing, wow, and she is eye candy too!!
Twins are awesome. \
I love the song September. Her voice.💓 Beautiful! Foreigner!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Never know in NYC!
Reggie ..YOU ARE AWESOME.
Christopher sing ELVIS FOR ME … Christine Duran CC was my wedding song to my deceased husband
🌹👍
Fantastic! Go girl!
Make it up with your Mom
You must know Mr R.   you do good stuff.   :)
Talk to him mum lovely boy ❤xx
This is the best channel.  Maximum, positivity!   Pure, humanity!
100%
Sitting in my dining room and enjoying the video! Teary-eyed for the young man and cheers for the rock star's daughter.  Loved it all!
So glad the Rock star stopped.  Wow she can sing.  Also love how the people watching really start smiling too!!  It uplifts them too!! Well done Reggie and team!!
Wow cayleigh did very good 😆😄🤩
You're an amazing guy, Reggie!
inspirational as most videos are., this is a top contender
Bravooooo     👏👏👏👏👏👏
Why do kids take a 80s hit song ? I luv this channel the best lately.
Life can be good if you let it!! Peace, Love!!
Well done Jason and Justin!!!
I bought the Foreigner 4 album when I was a teenager.(in the early '80s)
OK lil mis Teena Marie 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Christopher, beautiful voice!!!
I’m so happy for the girl shining with an anonymous dad supporting her, just behind the scenes. And for the boy, I wish this show could help him to reconnect with his mom and so they can have a better family life.
She is really good quality act !!!
I just smile everytime you ask someone how they felt! It’s contagious! Thank you!!!
No3 As good as you and your daughter is, lift your head up sometimes... look and listen  Unlike you I don't live round the corner... but 5 thousand miles away in fact.... Yet I'm aware of Reggie
Love watching everyone, good times always!
🙏Regie! What a beautiful pure soul. God bless you with more wisdom and joyful life. Hope your mom sees you beyond passing distractive things🙏🙏🙏
he has been doing this for a while to be able to be told “that one Elvis song” and knowing which song is being referred to
Cayleigh sings, "September!" For the love of music 🎶  Thank-you Yu
❤❤
No1 Christopher - First Nations never put kids with their parents in the same tipis and wigwams, cause they knew about the generation clash.... if you're both lucky, one day your mother will be a grandmother as well.... No2 Look at the bright side Justin.... whenever you mess up... it's only because you did what your older bro... Jason told you to do....
Wow, I feel young again!
Good segment as always but Cayleigh Capaldi her voice is incredible.... Chris make things right with Mama maybe you can't live together but she's always Mama trust me when she's gone your heart will ache!
When are you coming to Connecticut?
Amazing as always!
Cool foreigner rocks proper old school band
Great episode. Everyone sang their heart out 👏🇨🇦
She's a really good singer. But I HATE that song. I hate it soooo much. Don't ask me why.
This is to mum, we luv you 😢❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂😂   Soft and beautiful 😍 ❤❤❤❤
Reggie , thankyou. I am from NZ ( New Zealand . And, what you do to bring the best out in every community you go to is my favourite.
Oh my Lord, Christopher that was beautiful!  Go serenade your mom with that song and put everything behind. I just wanna hug you, you are so endearing!
Awe I wanna give Christopher a hug! He reminds me of my 15 yr old son. I can't imagine not being on good terms with my kids. Y'all need to fix that ASAP!!! ❤  The littles were so adorable! ❤❤
for anyone that doesn't know foreigner is huge. the fact that reggie just randomly ran into one of the band members on the street is mind boggling to me
They were all good! But one clearly has a gift🎉 Great video!!
That girl is so good I don’t know if she even realise her technique and her vocal range. She grown up in the best family an I can see that she had a great childhood from the spice that her father given in the band Foreigners where they had the best years for great musicians and also their performance was mint with beautiful lyrics and songs
Awsome all of them❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤
This is where I come when I feel Ive lost hope in the day. And it never fails.  Loved these kids so sweet.
Cayleigh, you're awesome! So enjoyable!
Great moments!  Happening to run into Rock N Roll royalty and his daughter hitting notes in the atmosphere, what a night!
Cayleigh slayyyeeeddddd
Fabulous Young Boy Singing For His Mum, and The Lady Singing September, Brilliant Show Today Reggie 👌👍👏👏👏👏👏
I loved all the parts. From Christopher singing to his mom, with so much love, to the adorable twins who sang their little hearts out to their mom, and Cayleigh who gave a mind-blowing performance. You’re astounding Reggie, with your guitar. I thought that you and Cayleigh were going to lift the sidewalks off the street with that song. Loved watching it!
X
Those two boys singing just reminded me of a cool channel of some public school in NYC where the kids in music class sing songs.  Love to start watching it again
Cayleigh 😍😍😍
Beauti...🌹
The Foreigner! 😮 He was being modest but dude is a legend! His daughter is very talented and came by it honestly! 👍
I love the song September, and especially her version of it! 🎉
Twins were also good ❤
oh dear
Cayleigh wow❤
Awesome.
Reggie....you always have the best guests! Hope the young man puts his life in order! Thank you Reggie❤️❤️
I can't choose one cuz I like them all I like the whole video Reggie thanks for sharing it was fun to watch ✌️🤗💛💙🇺🇲
So many proud parents of good singers could be seen here 😃👍
Best performance ever!
They did a reference to the group in AQUA TEEN HUNGER force, I F*CKIN LOVE FOREIGNER....
Lovely! Such a beautiful family, really cool girl.
ngl my 'dad' would bring with him to socially elevate his "status"...smh
YOUR A JUKE BOX HEROOO
I F***CKING LOVE foreigner, GOT ONE GUITAR THAT BLEW HIM AWAY WITH STARS IN EYES FOR THE VERY NEXT DAYYY
My heart broke for the first young man. I wish him well.
ouch
they had a TITANIC party at my childhood mansion, 69 ppl invited themselves to sleeep over wtf I grew up there...
Mom!! Christopher sang beautifully just for you.. ❤️
Reggie!!!! thank you so much!
Harvard Medical College uses autotune in their videos I believe
So happy for your channel! Always fills my heart with joy! ❤
Guitaro your channel is so heartwarming. I liked the entire video; the best part was how Cayleigh feels about singing. Even though she sings for a living, singing with you made her day. Makes me want to sing right now. And I appreciate that 99.9% of your clients are satisfied when they sing for free with you. #awesome #service ❤ Of course, I also liked the young man singing for his mother and the cute twins sharing a song.
JohnsonandJohnson
Foreigner! Wow. Cayleigh definitely has her father’s musical talent. What a wonderful performance. So much heart and soul in that family.
😀😀😀😁
3:39 amazing he sang for his mum.👏
do it nowww
VicintheGAME
Taylor Swift Impersonation sing along...
Cayleigh was amazing! a profesional singer unknown until that moment!
The first young man "you have any recommendations; anything you're good at?" Yeah, he's good at everything!! 😂🎸😂🎸😂
Wow she was so good!!
Should of got him to autograph your guitar 😐🤔🙄😏
Good stuff Guitaro
Great job Reggie. I love Foreigner.
love and peace to you Reggie
That was COOL to nab in one swoop an ex-Foreigner member and the BEST FREESTYLE SINGER I have ever seen on your channel. Cayleigh you are the real deal - and so are you, Reggie. Watching your channel makes me smile every day. ❤
Chris was awesome singing Elvis. That came from his ❤, Twins sang the song so well.👏🏼👏🏼 Young lady can sing! 👏🏼👋🏼❤️  Congratulations to all of you. You brought joy to many. Thank you.❤❤❤
you are the best best man ! keep sharein the love that sing brings .
Holyyy Cayleigh killed that rendition of September! That was SO good
Aaaww i enjoyed all of their performances 😊 so cute, and i hope the last girl achieves all her goals in the industry
Love you Reg you just so cool.
girl super
GOOD JOB REGGIE . . . YOU HAVE A GIFT OF BRINGING OUT THE BEST IN PEOPLE
Reggie I love your love for people and u  just showed that with the twins. You totally encourage the positive out of people and respect all ages. We need more people like u in the world!
AMAZING performances 🤩😍👍👏👏👏👏
I love It! ❤😊
Great singing but you just cannot abbreviate Earth Wind and Fire! EWF?! That’s an insult. 🧐 They deserve their whole name mentioned at all times, millennial! 😩
I enjoyed the whole show.
Singing free's your soul
Foreigners ...that was a cool band with great music. The dad is a star! And she is great too.
I 💕💕💕💕 ur vids!! Thanks for helping humans connect Reggie! You my Son are awesome!!!!
Good stuff... thank you!😊
I loved the humility of the "rock star." He could have made it about him.  He didn't sing or ask to play. He let his daughter shine. Great dad! Loved all the singers. Reggie, you always make me smile!
Evidently, I happen to notice that I am going to be the 100th comment to post!  I approve these videos of yours '100%'!  This video is like the other ones.  So terrific1   I can tell that you really enjoy doing this.  I am a music lover!  I grew up with my mama playing her guitar & singing.  Music has always been in my life.  I love it!
That young man Christopher is an absolute doll.  His mum is too ego-centric if she truly is not taking her child for "Who" he has grown to be.  Otherwise you wouldn't shun your baby.  There's so much Hope for this to get better.     Everyone here wants for the two of you the best.  So just take a breath and remember being an adolescent , Christopher has gone on to be a man.  Recipricate his love.  Christopher, PLEASE be SAFE, you will be idolized for your charming good looks and gentle ways. Stay grounded in the adulation that is yours if you want it.   Being less that 5'11" is not a short coming for you.  DO NOT allow some person(s) or thing of bad faith and or intentions keep you from being the best MAN Christopher CAN!  Stay healthy and live well.  Be YOU!  Now Reggie, "You're THE Bomb!"  Love you as the Bro I'd Love to Have...  Best of Intentions here spoken, I will Delete if there is any offense taken...
Reg you’re just a real nice guy ❤
My dream is to meet Reggie in person one day ❤️🎶
Love all of it!! ❤
Reggie be in my hood, And I never see him! One day if I cross paths I would happy to jam out with him! ❤

Reggie your vids don’t fail to brighten up my day and make me smile. Music is universally healing !  Bless you!!
Reggie 🥰🥰🥰
that was amazing. Love your videos @Guitaro5000
Great job as always REGGIE 👍❤😊
✌💞🖖🤙💪🎶🎤💃🎶 Fellow earthlings
ever though of coming to the UK . would be really cool
Foreigner, one of my favorite kick ass bands❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉
September is such a treat 👏👏👏😍💓💓💓
I love your spirit. Reggie, you bring out the best in people. Good times!
1:56 u la la....
So awesome Reggie! I love watching your videos. Always gives me good feeling ❤
I felt that guy was a Rock star, but his talent seems to have grown and multiplied in his daughter! What a solid voice! Hats off to dedicating a song to mom, especially an Elvis song.  Then to hear Tears for Fears from two young men! Great day to be alive!!
I hope Christopher's mom gets to see this
I hope your mom sees this!. Call her please. You got a great voice Christopher.
I love that not only can Cayleigh sing, but her very name is Gaelic for a get together with folk music.  Such delightful energy.  And "have you played before?" "Yeah, in a band called Foreigner."  Listened to Foreigner when I was young.  Ahem.  Such a typical NY kind of thing.
She sounds good nice voice .
I always cry when I hear that Elvis song.
Christopher you are quite a unique  presence and singer . Great job.
Saludos Reggie desde Madrid!
From Washington DC, I’ve been a huge fan …thanks for all the joy that you bring,  Reggie
The best 🎉
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
Loved the young man dedicating that song to his mum and then little kids too. Wow! That lady had an amazing voice and nailed her version of September perfectly👌💝
Hurt my ears.
Reggie5000, bringing joy one song at a time.
That is noise. Not good.
Foreigner! WOW TY Reggie XO
I hope the young man and his mother work things out.  Such a loss not to.  Cayleigh rocked September.  She’s a star!
Thae lady was fantastic. She needs to be signed up and given a record contract.😂
Kayleigh is a GREAT SINGER!!?she blew me away especially when she really got into the song!! Lucky girl to be born in a rock star family and it shows. God bless them all❤
Good song choices and very nice voices ❤
Jason and Justin well done ,all the way from New Zealand ❤ What an awesome inspiration, Reggie you rock
Oo this just happened... thanks for the music and songs Reggie.  Thanks for spreading love, watching from Malaysia

Not only is it wonderful for people to stop, sing, & have a good time but it is also wonderful to see their families cheer them on. I hope Christopher's Mom sees this video & feels a sense of pride in her Son.
The twin boys are adorable and they can sing. Loved them. Reggie you are a very special guy. Keeping you in prayers for safety as you bless this crazy world. I enjoy your channel more than AI & the Voice.
awesome!
I loved the gorgeous girl at the end, her spirit and voice is amazing!
That was an epic day 😎
bro beloenged to foreginer now ay
Reggie, you find the best people. Loved it and we are all blessed 🙏
Cailey just put a huge smile on my face.  The chances that she stopped by after a gig and just lit it up was unreal!  Mom and Dad did a great job supporting their daughter.

Wow, that young man singing the Elvis song was really touching.
The first young man is special.
love the boys! Fkya!! ❤
to the first kid, i cant help but think you should call your mom and just say you love her....
I was touched by the young man who dedicated the Elvis song to his mother. Even though they're not in good terms he still loved her enough to dedicate a song she loves. I really hope his mother was watching, and that things will work out between them.
All performers in this episode sung their hearts out. Very refreshing during these difficult times in our country
OMG...what a voice on that girl.!
What a wonderful voice
