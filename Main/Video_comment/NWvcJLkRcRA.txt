Results don't predict the future 3-0 Barca avenges themselves 3 times
Back when nunez could finish
Boo Barcelona
Benfica 2022/2023 was the best ❤
Darwin Nunez
Steady it's only a goal.  Getting carried away,  and that sliding accross the grass MAKES me feel sick
Man nunez is  ... please improve with us
what was frenkie doing, twice in front of goal when he should be shoting he is passing to luuk, talk about passing responsibility
forza benfica
Nunez 🔜 LFC
FCKN AWESOME... Bye bye Spain👋🏻👋🏻👋🏻👋🏻 See Ya...
Watching this makes me sad, all the memories of Barcelona through the years, just for it to come to this.
Forget the goals missed up front but as City fan I am very happy that Pep let Garcia go..
Luuk de Jong makes Timo Werner look like Robert Lewandowski.
Am a Rangers fan Good to see benfica back were they belong. Great result 💙
somethig is missing in barcelona
Depay needs a better team
Pique busquets roberto are just all finished need to go, Pique can’t handle anyone at all
The Barcelona players deliberately missed chances...looks like they are not keen on Mr Koeman.
Is there a reason why so much of the stadium is empty?
Well well hmm, man utd fan here
Since Koemann became manager it feels like more dutch players have arrived at Barcelona. Memphis Depay, then Luke de Jong and who knows who else. This happens in banking as well where a new manager will bring in his/her clan from his/her previous. Not sure if he's trying to protect himself in the dressing room but adding more Dutch players isn't going to get Barcelona back to winning the league and winning ways.
Joy for Barcelona joy for benfica anything but for Barcelona. A touch of the colemans there me thinks
Damn. Its official, barcelona have become the spanish arsenal. “Auba who? Auba wha? Luke da bludclard Jong”
Benfica were first out the tunnel before even the first Barca player was through lol.. nah sad to see Barca go like this.. to think we will never see that era again
Poor
My club💪
Barcelona should have Benny Hill music playing on every clip. They are a joke.
'ugh.. he's missed again' man I felt the disgust and disappointment from Steve lmfao
Nobody see when benfica scored the penalty and he said joy for Barca joy for benfica
Luuk De Jong is actually abysmal
Darwin nunez is a baller 👌
Barcelona turn into Dutch United....and things are going horribly wrong...lol
Just goes to show to be careful what one wishes for, mr Koeman.   Is he arrogant -well apparently he never apologised for wiping his arse with a Germany shirt....  This is his only shot to turn Barcelona into a well functioning squad.....
Rakitic fault Barcelona lost again..
Barcelona are finished
Luuk De Jong is a literal joke.
Great to see Garcia doing so well at Barca , left us to go to that shambles. Maybe he knew he was too small and too slow to make it in the PL.
LIVERPOOL UNITE CCHELSEA ALL WANT HALF OF BENFIACAS TREAM ESPECIALLY GRIMALDO HES AMAZING ON FOOTBALL MANAGER
BENFICA HAVE  A BEAST OF A TEAM BENFICA ARE THE OLD BARCA
these 10 minute videos are too long
The robust music rhetorically prevent because brace uniformly step towards a even excellent excited flute. roasted, lackadaisical orchestra
De Jong was as bad as I've ever seen of a Barca player
Hopefully messi can come back braca
haha barca are no longer a team to fear
Too easy, Barca who ??
Good game for Barca 🙌🏾
It’s not that Ter Stegen gets beat at his near post, it’s that he isn’t ready for the shot (and the guy is clearly shooting) and gets caught in the air & wrongfooted. Very bad goalkeeping.
I love watching barca and real madrid lose :D
i'm really not as upset at messi having to leave barca i'd hate too see him be a part of this shambolic club
Mcmanaman is so painful to listen to. Sound off
Just bring in a hood spanish manager who understands how barca used to play
Benfica deserve more credit
Luuk de jong is the worst professional footballer i’ve ever seen.
Pedri, future Ballon D'Or winner without a doubt. The boy is the most naturally gifted footballer I have seen in a long time.
All they needed in this game was Sergio
what is worse: Luuk de Jong’s finishing, or Steve McManaman’s commentary
They to a team with Nicolas Otomedi in it. Barca are finished!
Pedri won't be at barca for much longer.
if they had white T-shirts and white leggings they were directly real madrid
frenkie, pedri and ter stegen need to leave
barca's keeper is definitely trying to get koeman sacked
What is going on Barcelona
Ter Stegen is rubbish
Next to impossible to replace Messi, Iniesta, Xavi, Suarez and Griezmann without going backwards, going to be a long road back to the top for Barca...😱🤷
Barcelona are finished unless they get a new manager and sort out the finances and transfer manager Sounds a lot easier than it probably is
This is just sad now
At this point if my club (Spurs) went up against Barcelona right now I reckon we would thrash ‘em, and that says *a lot*
Why have ads during highlights. Ridiculous
Pedri is their best player
Bayern will show to Benfica proper game .
Barca with messi 🔥  Barca with out messi💩💩
it’s so amusing to me as an arsenal fan that barca are in their flop era, stinking up the place, ripe for the taking on any given day, but arsenal can’t even get in the CL to inevitably play them and exact some revenge ffs 😂
De Jong to De Jong chance now gone
:)
Nunez rapage
Koeman will be sacked at Christmas ho ho ho 🎅
Barcas  Duth obsession costing them alot!
Congratulations Benfica 🚫ИИ❤️TH50🇭🇷🇵🇹
I just love watching Barcelona lose. Where's your 'footballing philosophy' now?
Carlos Puyol and Dani Alves would do a better job at defense right now and as for Luuk De Jong LMAO!!!!!!!
Origi cursed them
Don't get carried away after 2games. Like they can't win next4. Goofy
"It was going wide but it was a really good block" Mcmanaman has to be up there with jenas as the worst commentator
Looooool. Barcelona are a poverty team
Wtf happen with Real and Barcelona this week🤣🤣 they need to go shopping 🛒 😂😂😂
"I think it was offside but how didn't it go in anyway.." classic.
When the team does not play well, real Ter Stegen comes out.
7:29 joy for Barcelona??
This mess was before Koeman. But he'll get the blame nonetheless.
Barcelona by name and not by nature 😭😭😭😭😭
as a guy with a lot of respect for this team, i dont think barca is going past the group stages. theyve hit the great depression cos of this coach. hes really gotta go
No one will fear Barcelona anymore,they are pretty pathetic nowadays
When EA Sports starts implementing random "goalie" walkabouts in FIFA 22 upto the halfway line like Barcelona's crazy M. Ter Stegen did in this game, I'll start thinking the video game devs are finally taking a realistic approach to gaming and not making me see players like Fred belt in a 30 yard screamer. Barca are finished.
Not even fully Koeman's fault, except the defense, and his nationalism issue of bringing Dutch players that dont deserve to be anywhere near the club like Luuk .
barca are the new arsenal…
is it me or the singing at the beginning sounds like " Lasagne"..???
What happened to Barca! So sad.
Must’ve got mixed up with the Barca B team
Eric Garcia is way too overrated he couldn’t defend a lemon
Joy for Barcelona, Joy for Benfica... wait what 🤔😂
Good start for Barcelona 😂😂😂 Their strikers play the ball backwards instead of going forward lol 😂
Feels bad for Depay
On the first goal, those were the worst stepovers i've ever seen and shouldn't end up with a goal at this level. It was like watching someone step over their garden gate. Bad times for Barca!
whats going on with barca man ? :(
Lol those stepovers from Nuñez were horrendous.
Seeing Barcelona in ruin gives me a nice warm fuzzy feeling.
Fun facts EA in Fifa 22 give luuk de jong (79) finishing... FAR AS I CAN SEE IT LOOKS 👀 ABOUT RIGHT 🤣
Football in Spain is dead.
Great performance from benifca 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿😊 Barcelona really bad night
Oh how have the mighty fallen from grace.
Oh how the mighty have fallen
This is going to be a long road for barca! Really should have cashed in on messi last year.
Darkest times for Barca 😟😟😟😟
"joy for barcelona"?? these robot commentators keep malfunctioning. can we please bring back humans like andy gray? football isn't as popular for youths as it was 20 years ago as it's too sanitised now.
Barca are broke. They're heading the same way as my team Derby County.
All the Barcelona players do be looking depressed
Joy for Barcelona haha
Joy for Barcelona 😆
I saw a photo shopped picture of bacra manager bending over benefic a logo.     Now I know what it's about 😂
Koeman's tactics for this game were all de jong
Well Barcelona is Spanish arsenal xD
Give Benfica some respect they played well , be hard team to beat . Barca a team that was .....🤣🤣
Barca are mid table not tryna get xavi
No idea why they chose koeman smh xavi is doing amazing his tactics show because it’s al ASAd
Goalkeepers watching Rene Higuita videos too much in last few years
It’s nice to see former West Ham loan signing, Joao Mario, doing so well.
7:29: ‘Joy for Barcelona’ ‘Joy for Benfica’ wait… what 🥲
Loving Barcelona's misery, long may it continue!
“Joy for Barcelona” commentator is on crack 😭
Hard to watch the decline of a Beautiful team
Darwin Nunes is one hell of a player
Why can’t barce players shoot ? They just pass the ball when they could of easily took a shot
23:00 What a goal!! Classic football
We need Messi man
His palms are sweaty knees weak arms are heavy. There's vomit on his sweater already mom's spaghetti
Ever since messi left … Barca been poop
Koeman ain’t the problem Barcelona r broke and cannot buy there way out of trouble
Lmao luuk de jong crotch thrusting at the ball then running into the post as it goes wide 😵
Would rather have joelinton up front than luuk de jong
Barcelona looked pretty Messi...
Otamendi > Garcia (still) MCFC contrarian
barca are a finish club no more stars like msn
Replaced Pedro with Pedri
Barca ain't got sh*t!.. Amateur players left hahaha
Ter  stagen old form : threw sand at him he’d catch every grain   Ter stagen recent form : couldn’t catch a cold if he tried
Big Sam to Barca when?
Not sure why people are expecting Barca to be 2011 Pep team. Its so naive and even the that guy Laporta is so naive to think a twthat has lost several brilliant players will perform the same. If he hates Koeman so much why doesn't he clone Pep instead. I'm not a Barca fan but the bbc article on Barcelona shows that Laporta has ridiculous expectations
why isnt aguero playing?
He has to go blud
That was the worst and slowest double cross-over I've ever seen... how does that trick the defender?! 🤣
ter Stegen 90, yeah? hurrhurrhurr
Barca needs 2 to 3 years to reset.
Luke de Jong ripping it up 😂😂
Farcelona
It's hilarious that Barca can't sack Koeman all because they can't afford the money they would need to pay him lol
Nothing reaffirms my belief that there are football fans that don't understand football more than absolute gonads blaming Koeman for the state of Barca rn
He got it all wrong did Luuk de jong. 😂
That scramble  that didn't go in at 1-0 is proof Barca are cursed
This team is finished
Could anyone name a player in Madrid or barca now who would be in the top 10 in the world. Premier league has took over.
I feel so sorry for Pedri
Barcelona the new Arsenal
Luke De Jong's Wikipedia page states rather accurately  "Reportedly Luuk de Jong suffers injuries to his eyes as well as his legs. Therefore he fulfills solely a role of garden rake at FC Barcelona. Scoring goals - which could be seen as the main job of a striker - is not even possible in front of open goal."
The worst Barcelona team in history  Bang average players with an even worse manager
UEFAlona are a sinking ship. They will be the AC Milan of Spain.
Feel sorry for Pedri. Imprisoned at the Nou Camp
what is ter Stegen doing!
It's time to goooooooo
Barsenal.
I feel like Barca will turn out like ax Milan did.. I hope not
Have to appreciate the finish for the 2nd goal!
Dont think I've ever seen Garcia have a good game, how he's played for Manchester City and Barcelona is a joke
Did anyone notice the commentator said "Joy for Barcelona" lool
@ 7m29s, after the third goal goes in via a penalty for Benfica : "Joy for Barcelona"? 🤣
Are Barca still waiting for Trent's corner to swing in I wonder? 🤔 x ynwa x
Commentator loves the one liners
This is the benfica Arsenal knocked out of the europa league last season😂😂
The Spanish giants are dying.
Not working out so well without Messi is it? 😬
Fc Banterlona
Watch frankie de jong from 5.12  till their 2nd goal , disgraceful commitment
Nada dicen Otro goleador del Uruguay. que tal ?
WHY are all EUROPEAN stadiums half empty in these CL games??
Luuk de Jong makes Andy Carroll look like a Ballon d'Or contender
Excellent performance by SL Benfica tonight 👏
Barcelona FC 1899 in the Europa League......Christ!!!!!
Not even a shot on target for Barca 😂😂😂
Rafa doing the classic toxic Fifa celebration is amazing to see😂
So glad koeman and anchiloti are not everton managers no more
That ship is sinking.
WOW! Barca are 💩   Juve can beat Chelsea without Ronaldo but Barca can’t beat Benfica without Messi   🐐
I love seeing the demise of the vile team that is Barcelona, no longer able to get their own way
Two awful signings in Eric Garcia and Luuk De Jong.
Momments Fc is what manchester united is all about,  the beautiful free kicks ronaldo did, Giggs running down the wing against aresenal, all momments of brilliance then won us league and title after title, SAF had no tactics, lol, Infact he was one of the worst tactitions in the league but he had a squad of believers,  this is the best we seen united in years, and its bloody brilliant, to have your heart racing, to come back from a dog fight, how many times have we been down 3-0 and we come back 5 -3  we beat teams 9 - 0 for crying out loud,  we just need somthing slightly extra in the Mid.  Here is some amazing momments in the SAF era.  Schemicals saves kept us in LOADS of games. Cantana, passing  Ronaldo Free kicks, (We won the league because of his freekicks and individualisem) Giggs running up the wing against Aresenal. 1999 Champions league two momments of brilliance from a corner we should of lost the game Alex Fergeson relied on Robin Van Persie .  We have ALWAYS PLAYED Counter Attacking Football, Shemicals Throwing, Or Fast Paced Forwards Rooney, Ronaldo, Giggs, Tevez,  Berbatov  Spin against blackburn. and 5 GOALS!!!   1984 European Cup Winners Quarter Final: Manchester United 3-0 Barcelona 1999 FA Cup 4th Round: Manchester United 2-1 Liverpool 1999 Champions League Semi-Final (Second Leg): Juventus 2-3 Manchester United 1999 Champions League Final: Bayern Munich 1-2 Manchester United   2001-02 Premier League: Tottenham Hotspur 3-5 Manchester United 2002 FA CUP THIRD ROUND: ASTON VILLA 2 MANCHESTER UNITED 3 (Comeback) 2003 PREMIER LEAGUE: ARSENAL 2 MANCHESTER UNITED 2 (Comeback) 2005 EUROPEAN CUP: BENFICA 2 MANCHESTER UNITED 1 Glazers Just bought us, and first time we left the champions League since 1992 (Under Sir Alex Fergeson) 2007 PREMIER LEAGUE: EVERTON 2 MANCHESTER UNITED 4 (Comeback 2-0 down) 2008 EUROPEAN CUP SEMI-FINAL: MANCHESTER UNITED 1 BARCELONA 0 (Paul Scholes , One momments of brilliance got us to the final agaisnt chelsea, Against a very good barca team) 2009 PREMIER LEAGUE: MANCHESTER UNITED 3 ASTON VILLA 2 (come back yet again, Its in Manchester united DNA, we let goals in but aslong as we score more then other team we win) 2010-11 Premier League: West Ham 2-4 Manchester United 2011-12 Premier League: Chelsea 3-3 Manchester United
Where is Messi? is he still injured?
Bruh even Arsenal beat Benfica
L de jong is a fraud
Spanish football, the sick man of Europe
Barcelona without messi is like France without Paris and Britain without London
Hahaha Barca going downhill without Messi
Luk de jong just pisses me off
Replacing Messi with the likes of Luuk de Jong no wonder their losing to be fair, he is hardly a world class striker. What an absolute terrible performance from Barca, well done to Benfica for capitalising on it.
This is Barca without infinite money from spanish gov and dodgy business, now next stop real madrid
7:27 JOY FOR BARCELONA????
Barcelona are falling apart 😥😧😮
Barcelona are falling apart 😔😶
Giving dest a yellow was harsh
joy for barcelona
great to see luuk de jong rediscovering his newcastle form
F De Jong fantastic at passing the buck
Too think Messi was being blamed for choking in big games when he was carrying this shambles. Not even Suarez was showing up in the CL games remember…
What an atmosphere when benfica scored
7.30 "joy for Barcelona" "Joy for benfica"  🤔🤔🤔🤔
This Barca just looks wrong.
What a job that was getting rid of Garcia
Ino the manager is bad at the min but who would even replace him I don’t think any other managers want the Barcelona job the club is a shambles
I feel so bad for frenkie de Jong, he’s too good for Barcelona, I would like to see him come to the prem. can’t say the same for the other de Jong
"JOY FOR BARCELONA???" BT at it again
I mean I get Benfica beat Barcelona but Barcelona ain't nowhere near the team they were. Celebrating bit ott if ya ask me but fair play they got the win
Barcelona we're better off signing Origi than Luuk De Jong lol
Barcelona have become the prime example of how to destroy your club by negligence and total incompetence! what a sad state they are in!
7:28 joy for barcelona
Salah and Trent are just itching to play for Barcelona, apparently they are offering £50 a week.
Barcelona will be liquidated soon
Who cares? English football rules. Only a few European teams would get in the Premier league. Fact.
To get beat by the worst step overs I’ve ever seen like that is just disgusting 🤢🤮…this ain’t  Barca 😕
Good to see them horrible 2 Spanish sides getting exactly what they deserve pair of bully crooks 😈
Ter Stegen is seriously overrated, how can he be compared to players like neuer
Eric Garcia is such a bad defender
It looks like Barcelona are getting what they deserve from the uefalona days joke of a club😂😂
Benfica had good game
Barca’s attack this season is a total joke very poor indeed
pedri was playing by himself
7.09 - Tom Holland? Lol.  And that second goal was crispy AF 👌
LOL
never thought barcelona would ever be a average team
Joy for Barcelona Joy for benfica  Anything but for Barcelona  Amazing commentary
How luuk de jong gets a game for Barcelona is beyond me
Spanish Newcastle. 😆😆😆
Life without messi 😂😂😂
“Thanks to me Barcelona have a future”  The future: 3-0 loss to benfica
7:27 "Joy for Barcelona" 😂🤣
Benfica 3-3 Rangers 2020 Benfica 3-0 Barcelona 2021  Am just saying WATP 🔵🔵
Wat did barca sell grimaldo for bt 7mill lol
Aguero joins Barca. Messi leaves Barca. Ageuro sings 'goodbye my lover' by James Blunt every night before bed. Barca turns into Oldham Athletic. Aguero joins Oldham Athletic.   Someone needs to make a film about this called 'Goodbye my Agueroooooooooo' :D
Luuk de Jong making Braithwaite look like Brazilian ronaldo
Luuk de Jong couldn’t finish a sandwich 🥪
Koeman has had a difficult start to Barcelona from day 1 everything was already early stages of the downfall. Can't blame him look at the players hes now with De Jong, Depay, Braithwate up top oh my word. Surely they have a better ST in their academy
The Spanish teams era is coming to an end 😪 no barca and no Madrid to win best bet finish 3rd and try the Europa
Pique was poor for that second goal he was playing everyone onside and missed an interception. Not been the same since that Bayern game
The calmest penalty I’ve seen in a while
I can still smell Barcelona now,  other than Pedri they need a complete rebuild. Koeman need Jesus and all the disciples to turn that around🤣
That's Garcia's second red, this season.
Luuk de Jong - providing shots even Karius would find hard to let in..
10min typical barca trying the jew
Simply Barca was not good enough for Messi anymore. But PSG it is more than any other club
Man.. What a fall from grace Barça are going through. To be honest they were on a steady decline but this season they’ve hit rock bottom
Benfica play the beautiful game , lovely to watch
Barca couldn’t finish there dinner.
What ever happened to the Barcelona the team everyone feared now everyone just labels then as jokes, they've lost all of their goal potential their midfielders are non existent the only solid players in that team are the remnants of slow players that are a shell of their former self in Pique and Busquets
Barring Pedri the whole team is awful
Maybe its because barcalona dont have a trophy winning team !!! They havent won a major trophy in years !!! There dna had LONG GONE !!!!! Theyve lost too many players and filled them spaces with the wrong signings ... REMEMBER this a team that got beat 8-2 !!!! With messi on the pitch !!!! Barcalona are a team of the past !!!!! Hate to say it !!! They had the vest team in the world 20 years ago ✌🏼
How tf did Eric Garcia get in Spain’s Euros squad and not Ramos?
i swear that De Long (striker) does not deserve even a sunday league game,who bought him ????
The pen shouldn’t have stood .. a Benfica  player ran in the box before he kicked it 🙄🤷🏻‍♂️
Messi milked Barcelona dry,then left. Just saying 😌
Impressive that Ben managed to score three past the whole Barcelona team by himself.
Koeman out
Watching Barcelona loosing warms my heart
7:28 “joy for Barcelona joy for Benfica anything but for Barcelona.  What
Stoke would have a chance here.
Don’t see Barca winning anything this season 🥴
barca are smart get rid of suarez a common goal scorer and get Luuk de jong who misses every shot
Tiki taki at its best
Nunez looks like a player destined for the very very top.
Barca in the mud 😮
Barcelona should get Lord Bendter out of retirement.
My issue with the footballing world is the club owners/directors don't care about the club doing well as long as they are getting their money. Barca are just one prime example.
wish we got Barcelona
I actually think if Arsenal played Barcelona right now, we could win. I wouldn't have been able to say that a few years ago.
Barcelona are finished
Barca has gone from Suarez to Luke de jong in one year
Where was fati is he injured again
De jong should think  about taking early retirement.
De jong omg 😅😅😅
That Nunez fella gonna be special
How are barca fans living these days ? Lol
ter Stegen higher rated than Mendy in Fifa 22 makes me sick...
Wait, surely that Isn't the same De Jong who played for Newcastle... Surely
Neuer: Sweeper keeper  Ter Stegen: 3:37
Adel Taarabt is now at Benfica?
At this rate even Arsenal would give Barca a good game😂😂😂
LOOOOOOOOL RIP BARCA
Barca could’ve been 2 up though what is that finishing wow gone from messi Suarez to that
Barcelona have fallen, HARD!!!!!!
But but... I thought Barcelona had a good future under Ronald Koeman? According to the man himself...
Nothing better then watching the fall of Uefalona.
By a country mile the worse Barcelona team in nearly 40 years of watching football. Shambles of a side
Barcelona are cursed lol
"Barca got rolled up and put in a spliff blud"
Barcelona vs Tottenham would be a great game
Luuk wasn’t very luuky today
ITS TIME TO GOOO
Banterlona
Barca finishing is like mine when I use manual control on fifa
Luuk De Jong up front for Barca, jesus how the times have changed
Barcelona are worst now 2021 but 2003 to 2019 was the best years 😕🙁
Whoever scouted Luuk De Jong needs their eyes checked.
Enjoying watching the farmers spanish league this year, enjoy inflation.
luuk de jong starting up top for barcelona just baffles me
I feel sorry for Ronald koeman because Barcelona definitely want to get rid of him
Barce and madrid finally falling off the top level , players are old or not good enough for both teams . Why would mbappe go madrid when there not gunna win anything and hes on his own there , all the superstars of football are elsewhere now
Joy for Barcelona Joy for Benfica Anything but for Barcelona  Quality
Barca are a joke
Love seing Barcelona fans cry 🤣🤣😭😭
Lmao i was confused why everyone is hating on De Jong until i realized that there is another one besides Frenkie
Loool barca are done. Couldn't happen to a more toxic club
at first it was kinda funny, now it's just kinda sad
PItty Barca fans losing messi
From Ronaldinho and Messi to this...how the mighty have fallen...well played Benfica
BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEENFIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA  SLB SLB GLORIOSO SLB GLORIOSO SLLLLLLLLLLB GLORIOSO SLB
Luuk de Jong is a saboteur 😂
Pique should be demoted to ballboy. Useless.
Barca is finished
Wow what a mess
I love seeing Barca struggle. Its payback for all the horrible decisions in their favour over all these years.  P.S. Not a Real Madrid or Espanyol fan.
Incredible defensive performance from de Jong.
I will still never understand how Barca have gone from Suarez and Griezmann to Martin Braithwaite 🥴😂
How is Luke de jong at Barca the man is the definition of unless
😂😂😂
Everyone blaming koeman but face is most these barcelona players aint anyone
Bye Bye Koeman.....how he got the job in the first place is beyond me he is a bad coach-manager period
Barcelona are dreadful the now .
Sorry, I tend to forget Barcelona have a devine right to win.
🤣🤣🤣
Barca thought they playing Bayern
Just sums up Barca's performance that after the first Benfica goal i get an advert of KSI laughing
7:27 joy for Barcelona, joy for benfica😭😭😂😂
Why is the ref even going over to the screen for the pen review its not even debatable at all!!!
Like Real Madrid it took them almost 15 years to dominate Europe from early 2000.   Now same might happen to Barcelona
There's weak then there's barca. No messi no tiki taki but want to walk it in the goal. Oh dear barca...
From koeman to woeman.
Garry Neville would of than better as a Manager than Ronald Koeman!!!😁
When's the DVD out
Luke de jong 😂😂 never seen out like it , the fact they sold Suarez is ridiculous he would of scored all of the chances they had
Seeing how barcelona have downgraded since 2014 is beyond me.    Messi, Neymar and Suarez upfront  Iniesta, Xavi Busquets In midfield  Alba, Puyol, Pique and Dani alves At the back                 And Marc Andre Ter Stegen still in goal or Claudio Bravo.
WE ARE BARCELONA
6:03 Commentator: He's not missing from there.  Luuk de Jong: I feel personally attacked by that😔
Ronald Koeman couldn’t tactically master his way around a piece of toilet roll
Barcelona really are in trouble. I just wonder if they’ll eventually go bust or whether they’re “too big to go bust”
Barca fell off without Pessi + not funny + ratio + touch grass
Incredible defensive performance from Luuk De Jong tonight, making sure he gets his body on everything and forcing it wide of the goal.
Ronald Koeman after this game:   " I used to coach Barcelona. "
No Messi, no Barcelona.
Gloriosos caralho 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Barcelona remind me on man u after fergi left I think it will be a good few year till barca are competing at top level again it's a real shame I'm a liverpool fan but sad to see a club with so much history and Ora of greatness around there name fall to piece's this way😢
finally the barcelona - real madrid monopoly is over.
lmao barca
Barcelona and Real Madrid really becoming Spurs and Arsenal of La Liga😂
CAN WE PLEASE REMOVE THE SCORE FROM THE TITLE AND STOP BEING 10 MINS LONG
Barcelona are done . Feel sorry for the fans
How far they’ve fallen😔
I reckon people need to watch out for teams like Sheriff, Ajax, Villareal, Young Boys and Benfica this year, definite dark horses
These barça guys are standing in front of the keeper and choose to PASS with the HEAD, like no one wants to score wtf
This Luuk de jong guy aint it 😭
This Barca team is nothing without Messi
if La Liga gets a couple more title contending teams besides Real and atletico madrid i think Barca's days in the Champs League are numbered, the lack of big clubs is why Real, atletico and Barca are guaranteed CL footy every season but Barca prob 3rd best la liga team now could be in trouble of auto qualifying if more teams join the title fight - who'd ever of thought it could happen to Barca, Messi could never be replaced - Messi WAS Barca - No Messi - No Barca whoever the manager
Barca really went from Suarez, Messi and Griezmann to Depay, De jong and braithwaite in the space of two seasons 😭😭
The downfall of a once great team FC Barcelona ? I hope not but doesn’t look good 😯
Koeman should never be manager of Barcelona,Dellboy
Amazing performance from Benfica and wise Jesus in optimising Koemans continuous mistakes and lack of understanding. Koeman is actively destroying Barcelona + the dodgy President
Barca should’ve had 2 if it was anyone but de Jong there. Would’ve been a completely different game if it wasn’t for him. Score line makes this look worse than it actually was
Yellow card for handball? Ffs
I recall seeing a Barca fan's comment saying "Koeman's the most Tactically intellectual Manager to ever step foot in Barcelona" after seeing Koeman place Pique in ST. He genuinely wasn't even being sarcastic... Sums up Barcelona
Gb koman
Luuk de Jong running about for Barca 🤦
Aguero needs to replace de jong asap
just the name left from this team
Imagine going from Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez, and ending up with Mephis Depay, Martin Braithwaite and Luuk De Jong...   Really out here finishing like a man with 10 league goals in THREE full seasons.
From Luis Suarez to Luuk de Jong haha
Are We Koeman or are we Barca?
It’s only Barcelona lol
🤣😅😂
That luuke de jong open goal miss at the start, Suarez wouldn’t have missed that if he was still there
How the once so mighty has fallen its great to witness the demise of barca after all the years of paid officials lol 🤣
Welcome to post-Messi Barcelona. It's a shell of its former self
What is Koemans obsession with signing Dutch players? I would understand if the national team was good, but they aren’t...
This team causes me depression
How has he not been sacked yet?!
Minute 7.28 Commentator says after Benfica score penalty "Joy for Barcelona" it looks like they have a script ..)
‘Oh, he’s missed again’ had me in stitches
Ronald Koeman = the man who destroyed Barca. He starts by selling Suarez and Griezmann…ended with the departure of Messi. This team it has no future!
Pedri needs to get out
Has spains decades of dominance come to an end
It’s not the team.   It’s the manager.
I only ever liked Barca coz of messi I’m so glad this is happening to them especially after 2006 and 2011
Another reason the European“soccer” League was a rubbish idea. Wonder how much talent isn’t seen in the NBA!?
That Nunez looks class
barca in the mud
Why is everyone blaming koeman? Barcelona have a shocking bad and old team
Ignore ter stagan's positioning get him as a left back
Lol 😂
Glad they’re making these hilights a little longer now. Those 3 min videos missed so much action.
Eric Garcia is terrible lol
Why does Luuk de Jong start sprinting a pass too early? He's 31 years old and doesn't understand the most basic attacking play.
Where is the goal keeper going why is he there !!!!!!!
Barcelona by name, Barnsley by nature
Darwin Nunes is unreal
Even the commentator Had a bad night
Barcelona are finished
This is what Barcelona done sold manaj who was one the best players in pre season, put griezman on loan at athletico and now they have Luk de Jong who can’t finish
If only Barcelona had a striker like Suarez or Griezman
Let's all kick Barca whilst they are down. Haha.
It’s anyone’s to win this season
I feel sorry for Memphis Depay
Joy for Barcelona hoy for Benfica, but not joy for Barcelona?
Luuk De Jong, on this performance, might actually have been abducted from his day job managing a Currys PC World
SLB ⚽
Pique is a joke of a defender, and is getting exposed after being protected for years by a pressing midfield in a farmers' league. Sadly I think the same will happen to Ramos at PSG in the Champions League as it happening to Varane
Don't worry, Barcelona can win the Europa.
Messi leaves now Barca are Trash 🤣
Barcelona were shockingly bad that's because Benfica made them look like an average team.
Ter Stegen, like a lot of Barca players, has always been over rated
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Koemans got to go 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Love seeing Barcelona in chaos
Now is the time for Dundee United to play Barcelona again and make it 5 wins out of 5.
I reckon that Arsenal could finally beat Barcelona now.
A moment of silence for Barthalona and Mathrid.
How the mighty have fallen... koeman a failed premiership manager failed premiership players... this Barca side wouldnt finish top 7 in the prem.. luuk de Jong says it all couldnt get in the Newcastle team
Luuk de jong Newcastle Utd failure, Barcelona starter🤷🤷
Gathering average Dutch players and hoping for a miracle. It's embarrassing.
Koemans plan is to throw as many Dutch players as he can in the team and hope one of them inherits the mystical powers of Johan Cruyff and saves the day
Just a curiosity, Koeman used to be Benfica's manager.
The Mystique is all gone, like Manchester United, AC Milan and Real Madrid.
Messi was the band aid who kept this finished team together
If that was messi thzt would be goal of the champions league group stages 🤣
Another example of the breakaway insanity? Come on Benfica, Sheriff etc!
tf was ter stegen doing
Barcelona really need to regroup and do more than what there doing and no one can say its cuz messi left that's only 1 man they need to sign some hungry young talent
Sad to see what was the best team in club football reduced to this !
Marc Ter-Stegen saw the video of what the Porto keeper during the fourth Liverpool goal and decided to try out that same tactic!  I think Manuel Neuer needs to properly teach him how to be an effective Sweeper Keeper
Ter Stegen is Bernd Leno’s older brother. Same rush of blood to the head syndrome
Wtf is araujo doing on that second goal
Barca are just the Spanish arsenal now 💀
Depay must be getting flashbacks to his spell at Manchester United
Ronald Koeman used his own money 6 million to sign for Barcelona.  Inherited a big mess. Had a key player leaving  plagued with injuries. Not a single coach would do a better job
Joy for Barcelona joy for benfica anything but anything for Barcelona. I'm sorry what... haha
LOVE TO SEE IT!! 🤣 Now people realise that UEFA is rigged for star players. They dont care which team they are on they will follow the teams. What happened to UEFAlona 🤣 It was UEFAnel Messi the whole time
Ter Stegan saw what the Porto goalkeeper waas doing and thought he wanted a bit of that action.
Barcelona favs to win Europa League then
Barcelona are jokes 🤣
When i hear barca now all i see is failure
Of all the teams to lose me a big bet i never thought it would be Barcelona, Jesus really hates me
Benfica aesthetic giving me arsenal vibes  Red and white kit Same sponsor And the stadium is in the same style and looks similar.
Luuk de jong is not good
Still kinda amazed teams haven't raided Barca for what few good players they have left.
Well deserved by Benfica. They worked hard for 90 minutes, believed in their strikers and didn't give a damn about all this Barcelona struggling nonsense.  Barcelona are going to go nowhere for at least a few years. There's not a manager out there who will lead this average team to trophies.
Koeman needs to have a word with Frankie, like ffs man GO FOR GOAL SOMETIMES!!!
Luuk de jong: “yeah, I don’t know how I got here either...”
lmaoooooooooo love it
Darwin nunes looks so good! Also why benfica stadium so empty?
Barcelona dun out ere
Why did VAR need ref too check that handball really!!
How long has Barcelona had this away kit
Thoroughly enjoying Barca's downfall XD
Even now I still can’t understand why Barca let Suarez leave . Barca are the victims of their own poor management from the club directors.
Get guardiola the fraud to come manage that Barcelona team and try and win the champions league lmao
Barcelona don't look a threat anymore, look at psg mn city Liverpool Chelsea... Squads, Messi scoring blinders with psg now, who's barcas star man?
Ter stegen is the worst I've seen
Pique is finished in the top flight, he needs to go to the MLS and retire there
Barca just lack finishing now after gathering confidence again.
No messi no Barca
Barcelona need a rebuild. The only players that even deserve the shirt are Depay, Dest, De Jong and Pedri. I think Busquets, Pique and Roberto need moving on. They’re too old. As for the rest they just aren’t good enough. And don’t even get started on the manager, he’s shocking.
Barca are falling apart
A sunday league team can defend better than Barcelona😂
7:27 benfica 3-0 commentator joy for barca 😂
barcadogs😂😂
Luuk De Jong is at Barca? 😂 What has happened to the once great Barcelona?
Darwin Nunez next Uruguayan superstar. Big clubs will be looking at him even more this season.
Benfica were class. Barcelona were absolutely miserable.
Travel agent to Koeman "will that be a return ticket" Koeman "no just a single please"!
2017 Barca attack: Messi, Suarez, Neymar  2019 Barca attack: Messi, Suarez, Dembele  2021 Barca attack: Dembele, Luuk De Jong, Depay    poor Barca
I think my school football team could beat Barca at this point 😂
Everyone talkings bout how bad Barca were but luuk de jong was shocking
Hasta Barca, on their way to the Euro super league now with Real Madrid lol
Barcelona are actually washed now. Whole club is finished.
Imagine they get conate
How Koeman got the Barcelona job is beyond me. Getting by in his playing career reputation only.
La liga is the real farmers league
Koeman "thanks to me this club has a future" 😂
Come Back messi
The benfica boss to his players before the game. "Don't worry lads, it's only Barcelona"
I love seeing the down fall of barca 🙌🏿
Man I see a lot of comments dismissing Benfica... Benfiquistas, estão de parabéns, jogaram fenomenal, adorei. Isto vindo de um sportinguista, torço para que passem de grupos
Don’t sleep on my team BENFICA
Lovely to see these over reaching Spanish clubs struggling,  years of taking all the best players and spending beyond their means has finally come back to bite them...love it!
idk why people think its koemans fault barca shouldve been up by 3 after benfica scored but they didnt take their chances. this is all on the players
Man said benefica
SIUUUUU
This year's el classico will be interesting. It will be like watching your average game in League 2.
The two big Spanish teams are a busted flush now...why any of the worlds best players would want to go there with the useless players around them is a mistake
Europa league pending
I feel like koeman should be sacked
I reckon Barcelona could get a win playing against Barnsley at home but even then I think it'd be a close game possibly penalties or extra time.
So Barca winning europa league?
If Werner was slow🤣
Hey Barca fans,thought depay was good? 😂😂 he is one of the worst and overhyped players ever. He’s made a career living off of hype and not actually done anything ever.
Conte at barca would be interesting
Super Cup was to save Spanish Clubs. The English fans put a stop to that. Barca then had to sell Messi. We owe so much to the English fans for causing a big shake up in football
It could have been 5
Barca were laughing at Real Madrid Now the tides have turned
Did he say “joy for Barcelona “
Its nice to see Barcalona completley fall apart. Spain have nothing to offer anymore. Their economy is that of a 3rd world country and now their football reflects that 🤣
No surprise messi left
How can Barca be in such dire financial situation. Criminal offence
Dear barca fans, as a manchester united fan, take it from me...it only gets worse from here.  But dw, wait 12 years and your 🐐 will return with dani Alves as the PE manager.
Barcelona r embarrassing don't even deserve to be in the Europa League never mind the Champions League
Barca are so dead if we can beat benfica anybody can
After a decade watching Barcelona destroy all that was put in front of them, including beating United twice in the CL final, I’m loving this.  Koeman - manager of the season
That Barca team wouldn’t get in the top 10 in the prem
barcelona = shambles
Barcelona should just restart club at this rate
De jong (the striker) is basically Braithwave right now
U got  embaressed  booooooo
Birmingham cud beat barca at this rate
Arsenal we’re never that bad in CL. Barca are finished
My team❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
VAMOS BENFICA ❤️🤍❤️🤍❤️🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅
Once braithwhaite and Alba are back and Koeman gets the sack Barca will be back on form. Barca should have score two easy goals but man like de young is a proper a howler wad de fkkkkkkk
De Jong is so bad I’m embarrassed that he scored against us 2 years ago (Man United)
He said joy for Barcelona joy for benfica no joy for barcelona
I looked at that barca squad and at the moment it's laughable
Yooo😁
Barca need to be put up for sale
The Irish guy was right.
All these fan boys saying La Liga was the best now with no Messi or Ronaldo Real/Barca are being exposed.
When have Real Madrid & Barcelona both lost on a matchday in the Champions League?
‘Because of me this club has a future’
He's going to get the sack. I had low expectations for Barcelona in the Champions League, but not this unfortunate.
Bring xavi
Period doesn't deserve this era
RIP Barcelona
barca in the mud with no messi
Vertonghen and otamendi, pedrinho, pizzi, yaremchuk  All better than barcelona’s players
Now I understand why Pogba is unsure about leaving for Spain....
Luke De Jong is so bad 😂
Loserlona is done
oh deary me.....🤦🤦
Ter Stegen the most overrated GK in the world.
I was going to say that Barca are going to get torn apart when they play a top team in the next round but they’ll be in the Europa League by then. If they’re lucky enough to get third place.
Luuk De Jong is absolutely trash😂
Jesus, Luuk de Jong had a night to forget... Just to know that Barcelona went from having strikers like Suarez and Villa from having a striker that can't put it in from 30 cm away from goal, he could've easily scored 2/3 goals if he were half decent
Barca in the mud
Barca why
Worst display by a cf I've seen tonight by L de Jong
Ronald Koeman more like Ronald McDonald
How the mighty have fallen.
the new AC Milan
Barcelona are finished. He might as well play Philip C.
“No where near them” I love when the bias commentators get shushed 😂😂😂😂
🦅🦅🦅🦅
Barca in the MUD 😂😂😂😂😂😂
The amount of times Barca could’ve shot but instead forced tiki taka is criminal
McManaman must be the worst co commentator in the history of co commentating. He makes Robbie Savage sound articulate.
Barca and Real Madrid both going into the Europa comedy cup
Only one option Bring back neymar or sign good and creative player
Koeman is pathetic but glad to see Barca and Madrid struggling 😂😂😂
7:28 😄😄😄🤦‍♂️
In the last 2 games in that stadium Barcelona have concede 11 goal
Koeneman destroyed Barcelona completely  They can’t play no more
Put your VPN onto Canada and watch the danz highlights. They get them out way earlier and they’re always way longer. Just better in every way than what BT puts out
Jajaja
De Jong has had a stinker
From Suarez/Messi onto DeJong/Braithwaite. Says it all really 🤷🏻‍♂️😂😂
I am a Benfica fan and I've never been so proud. I'm definitely going to wake up with a hangover.
Koeman destroying his FC Barcelona legendary status remember this is guy who won Barcelona their very first European Cup in 1992 with that great freekick against a loaded Sampordia team that had vialli mancini lombardo the bald eagle
Barca are done out here 🤣
Luuk de Jong one of benficas best defenders
Barcelona  fire 🔥
Koeman needs to be sacked I said it from before the start of this season when Messi left and the transfers Barcelona did they would struggle Koeman should of gone at the end of last season
Barcelona are gonna be in Europa league
Dead club
Barca had a good run with great players but it couldn't last forever
Sad to see Barca struggling
The Europa league anthem getting louder and louder each day at the new camp
Viva o benfica
Barca are down bad.😂
I love watching this downfall. It warms my heart
Pitiful performance by barcelona
They've hit rock bottom; losing to a team of tramps apitomizes their fall from grace.
Love it
Barcelona have really fallen.
Why would Benfica fans know the White Stripes Seven Nation Army riff? Am I an idiot for just noticing that BT use an automated crowd noise in their replays? 🤔
Dutchlona 😂 😂
RIP Barcelona FC.
As an Everton fan, absolute LOL at Koeman’s performance at Barcelona. Screwed us over and now he’s screwing Barca as well, the man is worse than useless.
Legendary moments players
Eric Garcia is probably the worst young cb I have ever seen he shouldn’t be playing in the cl let alone barca
Adel Taarabt even getting game time against barca now 😂
Yes Benfica
Joy for Barcelona
Nunez is a player to watch
To think this club in the recent past had Iniesta, Messi, Xavi, Neymar, Rakitic, Suarez, Griezeman. Terrible management by bartemou
This is embarrassing
Farsa perdón Barça 😂😂😂👍
Someone said UCL is only competitive from Quarter Finals or Round of 16. Where is that person now?
Ok how is this the managers fault, football fans make no sense. The players for Barcelona are wackkkkkk. Including that defense of theirs
Luke de jong replaced messi…enough said
Barca really daat light yh?!
And nobody talks about my GLORIOSO S.L.B amazing game amazing performance we are back on the track.. COME ON LADS
I still can’t believe the ex Southampton coach can’t inspire Barcelona. Surely his time with Everton must have them so eager to learn from this genius of football
Barcelona may be fitted out with a -20 GD come the end of the group :)
Dest thought he was playing American soccer
Hahaaaaaa
Joy for Barca , joy for benfica 🤦🏻‍♂️
RIP barce⚘🤣
Spent force, nuff said.....
Benfica dark horse or nah?
Can't sack koaman because it's like a 10mil pay out
To be fair the El Classico Europa League final will be great
Ter Stegen thought he was Manuel Neuer :D
Barca proving ever so more they was a one man club and are nothing without Messi.  It's sad that I grew up watching the likes of Ronaldinho, Rivaldo, Puyol, Xavi, Iniesta, Busquets, the list goes on, the team who made tiki taka football an art piece but today they don't show any identity they lack character and I don't see it getting any better any time soon they just continue to make bad decisions.
Joy for Barcelona, joy for benfica, anything but for barcalona, it’s Barcelona by name but not by nature.😭😭🤯I want some of what this dudes been smoking😂   7:28
Eric Garcia may be the worst CB I've ever seen
BARCA LET SUAREZ AND GRIEZMAN GO. NEXT GAME WILL BE INTRESTING MARTIN BRAITHWAITE AND LUKE DE JONG AT TOP. MIDDLESBROUGH AND NEWCASTLE REJECTS
Joy for Barcelona
7.29 joy for Barcelona 😂 seriously dude just totally kick them while there down Its not funny anymore it's really sad for Barcelona
I don't think I've ever seen such pathetic football in my life from Barca and Madrid. Things are changing
'Joy for Barcelona, Joy for Benfica. Three Nil!' - apparently Barca enjoy being slapped about
Barca are poor they need rebuild
👌🇵🇹
“Where is the goalkeeper going, why IS HE THEEERREE”
Oh dear barca are fooking terrible at the moment....
Barcelona in the Europa lge pending
Taxi for Ronald
As a Barca fan I don’t even wanna watch this I just came paused it and came straight to the comments😞. End of an era Barcelona we are finished unless we sack koeman and get like a sick manager.😞
Did I just hear “Joy for Barcelona, Joy for Benfica” after the penalty was scored
Barca are gonna have to hold dat
“Where is the goalkeeper going? Why is here there” Meanwhile Manu Neur is chilling at the halfway line every other gae
Soon Celtic will be able to beat Barcelona .
Ter Stegen is a fraud
In the Barcelona of the good old days that everybody talks about that handball wouldn't be a penalty iven if cows had covid 😅
tbh of barca played a better striker coulda have been 3 3
bro, if man utd come against benfica, we are out, they played well
7:28 joy for barcelona😭
Koeman isn't the man to lead Barcelona to glory days, that coming from an evertonian who seen how poor we were under him.
Oh how the mighty have fallen
This week we saw the end of La Liga!
Luke de jong the worst striker in Barcelona history to ever wear the shirt
Joy for barcelona joy for benfica, anything but for barcelona ?????!! 7:28
Koeman" "This club has a future, thanks to me." 😂😂😂
Barca turning into a B class Holland team 😩
10 years ago they had maybe the best club team ever now they have this shambles 🤣
how the mighty have fallen
The one player I'd have from this Barca team is Pedri. Koeman isn't going to get the money without a takeover, bringing in loads of Dutch players won't do it. Where's the youth academy?
All I see lately is busquets walking way into the camera upset 😂😂
First goal off no
See ya later Koeman
Benfica actually have a really good team and a devastating attack. They could definetly be dark horses in the CL and get to the QF's. Mix of established stars and workhorses in the team.
I love Barcelona struggling like this lol
Good, i fought I would never see this day especially in my life time, its getting sweeter by the min
Luuk De Jong is a mystery purchase, he failed at Newcastle, was awful, and suddenly he's up front for Barcelona a few seasons later. How they have fallen.
7:29 commentator "joy for Barcelona"
Luuk de jong couldn’t finish his dinner
the spanish giants are dead
How is Koeman even managing Barcelona 🤣 surely Conte is considered if the can afford him
I’m a united fan it’s actually sad what has happened to Barcelona but they can only blame themselves.
Frenkie de Jong is levels above some of these current barca players
Who said La Liga was better than the prem? 😂
This has to be the worst Barcelona team of the past 30 years
The rest of Spain must be loving the demise of Barcelona!
This is sad
Frenkie’s one on one and he passes 😂
How the mighty have fallen.
Nunez looks a real handful, very dynamic. Could def do a job in the prem
Pillow Foot De Jong 🤣🤣🤣
What we did is unbelievable don’t take credit away from Benfica we played phenomenal força glorioso
cant help but feel bed for barcelona
Messi Eto'o Ronaldinho and Henry to Braithwaite, Depay, De Jong and Fati....
Im so happy real madrid and Barcelona have fallen apart its karma they tried to destory football and now the clubs are being destroyed just feel bad for the fans
It's a dissolution of the monarchy with both the Royals of Football last night Real Madrid now Barcelona
shouts out to Yaremchuk, Baller of a player love watching him play.
Barcelona got a great goal keeper but poor defending. Great performance for benfica
No messi....
Is there any wonder Real Madrid, Barcelona and Juventus are persisting with this Super League nonsense? Three absolute shambles of football clubs right now...
442 fans will know. 'Sacked in the morning, your getting sacked in the morning, sacked in the moorrnniinng. Your getting sacked in the morning.'
Frenkie de jong is too talented to be apart of this sinking ship
From nearly beating Arsenal overall to whitewashing Barca I love this game 🤣
This may be the worst Barcelona team I have seen in a very long time.  With probably the worst manager they've had in awhile.  Credit to Benfica they looked on top tonight.
Goalkeeper number 99🤣
Luuk de yong is the yearly random banter player at Barca
Funny how the cheer for a goal around Europe is different. England 'yeeeaaaaa'  other country's 'oooooooo'
El Barcelona es mortal , su inmortalidad se acabo con la llegada de Laporta y la salida de Messi. Si alguien se tiene que ir del Barcelona es Laporta, pero ya mismo.
Sort out the sound on these videos. Crowd noise on here is like background music, while the commentators sound like they're hosting a podcast. A mess.  Its football, want the crowd atmosphere more than the ramblings of some scouse guy.
Darwin Nuhnez would be perfect for Liverpool
Can't believe Koeman had the audacity to say the Club has a future now that he's in charge
Barcelona is mortal, its immortality ended with the arrival of Laporta and the departure of Messi.  If anyone has to leave Barcelona, ​​it is Laporta, but right now.
Pedri and Frenkie deserve so much better than this
I cant even recognise the quality of these barcelona players anymore. The bar for them as a club has been dropping exponentially
I don’t blame messi for leaving
Can someone explain to me why pique didn’t went have been sent off ? 🤷🏽‍♂️
Are Barca afraid to shoot first time?   So many chances just knocked back across the box, take a a shot lads!!
The softest voice of "ahh he's missed again" lool
The mighty Barcelona has fallen, never thought I would see the day.
Just goes to show how much messi carried them
"The bigger they are, the harder they fall"
barca have the worse forwards
Barca will not make out of the group stages. Just watch!
7:42 ."...and its another hammer blow"....for Spanish Club football this week!
Barcelona Without messi cant score,create or defend and on top of that they might not even make it to the next round 😆 what is the keeper doing OMG 😂
Depay will be thinking of good old day at Lyon.
Barcelona the new Norwich city hahaha hahahaha 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ouch, Barca are looking awful
Frenkie is the only good thing left in barca
Luuk de Jong should not be at Barcelona
Barcelona keeper thought he was Manuel Neuer 😂😂😂😭😭😭
It couldn't not be simple than this, play depay as centre forward and deploy pedri and coutinho as Central attacking midfielders then deploy alba as a attacker allowing de Jong to be a box to box and Sergio Busqueats deployed as a sitting deep midfielder...
Who would have thought that Barcelona would be the whooping boys of Europe.
Europa league outfit treated as such 😤
bro stomped the ground on his stepovers so hard for the first goal 🤣🤣
As a Newcastle fan it is absolutely mesmerising seeing Luuk De Jong up front for Barcelona. Absolutely baffling.
7:30 “Joy for Barcelona?” 🤨
Man never thought I would live to see the day where both Real and Barca both struggling... badly! What is happening over there?
What a game by Benfica
Barca won’t be back to their best days for a very long time - Madrid can put their feet up for 5 years or so!
How is Jesse Plemons still in a job?
LUUK DE JONG IS TERRIBLE 😧 man is literally stealing a living.. he couldn’t finish his dinner even if it was spoon fed to him
Only F. De Jong and Ter Stegen could be considered world class, even then that's probably a push. This Barca team wouldn't get top 6 in England, even if they had a good coach. Probably about the standard of player that Spurs and Arsenal have.
Luuk de Jong the worst striker in Barcelona's history, shocking player
sooner or later we’ll have accrington vs barca (7-1)
He done well at Southampton...😅
Frankie de jong and ter stegen do not deserve to be in this barca get them in prem or a top team honestly feel bad for them both
Frenkie de jong needs to leave, he’s a class act and too good for a team clearly going backwards and let’s be honest don’t have much hope
Joy for Barcelona joy for benfica
bring conte in
Barcelona just went bad to worse really quick
Joy for Barcelona joy for Benfica anything but joy for Barcelona bit sus that
And so begins Barcelona's decline
As an LEGENDARY icon once said: IT'S TIME TO GO!
Ronald Mcdonald will be new Barca manager
Barcelona are gonna struggle in the Europa League
At this rate Bury & Derby would make a VERY interesting game with Barcelona🤣🤣🤣🤣
Even troopz mum is koeman out
Barcelona are toss lol.
This barcelona team has to be the worst ive seen of them in the last 30 years. What a mess, in over 1bn debt, average players, unwanted players, injuries.
Great to see the most arrogant club in the world humbled.
“Joy for Barcelona, joy for benfica anything but for Barcelona” Commentary at its best
So we not gonna talk about those terrible step overs or….😭😶‍🌫️
Why on earth are Pique and Busquet still wearing Barca shirts?
yeahhh memffff
Benfica scalp Barcelona.......
Barca are finished! 😂
Benfica were on fire amazing game
Luke De Jong must be one of the worst footballers I've ever watched
Wow Barca suck now
Why did frankie de jong even side pass it to luuk de jong! Just shot ffs
I feel bad for Busquets
Theyll bounce back. Barcelona will win the laliga and champions league before 2040 so theres that. This is just a transformation period.
One of the worst appearances ever
In a way I’m glad Messi left Barca.. I wouldn’t have wanted to see him play in this shambles of a team and hurt his legacy!
Barca the new Deportivo
barca simply lost to the better team today end off
Brighton nearly had this Nunez guy. Love Maupay tho anyways
7:28 Joy for Barcelona 🤔😭
How Eric Garcia has ended up at a historic club like Barca is beyond me
Not mad that my country's league is one of the best these days, but it's still sad to see Barca and Madrid slipping like this. The Messi, Iniesta, Xavi, Villa era seems so long ago now.
Benfica unbeaten so far this season, we look good and seem to have put on a perfect display against barca however it won't be talked about seeing the state of them right now
how the mighty have fallen!
can easily see barcelona returning to their early 00s days where they finished 4-6th for a few seasons
Barcelona in the mud 😂
It's just sad at this point
They have been this team for years but this time they don't have messi
I miss suarez badly
4:13 the disappointment lmao
The downfall of Barcelona is a joy to watch
UEFALONA ARE FINISHED
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Real Madrid and Barcelona in free fall. Can no longer afford to splash £100 million on other leagues best players now stuck with absolutely trash.
😂😂😂😂😂
I’m loving Barcelona’s downfall
7:28 *Barca concede a 3rd* "Joy for Barcelona, Joy for Benfica"
It’s about now Barcelona feel so sad it’s a part of cycle in about 5 to 19 years
Should have simmed the game
ter Stegen trying to do a Diogo Costa 😂
Benfica's forwards look on point...barca's on the other hand lol luke de jong 🤦‍♂️. Hurts my heart to see barca in free fall.
Imagine signing a nobody dutch coach, who then brings in a load of crappy dutch players. lol.
How the mighty have fallen
Barcelona need to talk to the Illuminati to forge a new messi who is going to be  a blood sacrifice is up to them just got of the phone with the president?
What a world we live in former Everton managers koeman and Ancelotti losing in the same week🤣🤣🤣
Feel bad for de Jong he's putting in so many good balls and no one can even finish their dinners
Koeman can’t leave Portugal as Barca manager
Memphis Depay might as well go full time with his rap career.
Never thought I'd see Barcelona and Real Madrid this bad at the same time.
I swear if this game doesn’t scream for Man City to buy nuñez
barca have some world class players and should be winning games so its no secret its koemans fault at this point
I always said take Messi away and barce won't be the same
Frenkie de Jong’s a bottle job now 😅
"Joy for barcelona, Joy for benfica, anything but for barcelona" Me:Huh?
Messi leaves and it all goes down hill.
Madrid and Barca getting karma'd for all that super league bs 👏
Ever since that corner they haven't looked a top 15 club.
They’ll be out of Europe altogether at this rate, let alone Europa league.
Imagine barca in the Europa league...oh wait
Maaaate… Spanish league is DEAD ☠️
these rubish c class players dont desever to play for barcelona man wtf
Not to shadow benfica in anyway they played brilliant but this really is the end of barca mad facts
Barca needs to bring in The Special One to salvage this season.
Messi, Suarez & Griezmann all scored yesterday and boy could barca do with them goals
mate that last stepover was hilarious! lol
Why did ter stegen feel like just a complete replay of that porto keeper last night🤣🤣what’s going on
3:36 This is twice a goalkeeper has done this in 2 days, is there a glitch in the matrix?
“Because of me Barcelona have got a future”   Nobody said it would be a good future😂😂👀
Commentator said Joy for barca and joy for benfica at 7:25
Barca are bums.
That Nunez player played so good need him in the prem ASAP
Nunez is unreal
"Its time to go"  Claude.
This team is finished
Simeone better pull the Uruguayan ace out of his sleeve to sign Darwin for Atleti
I’m a Newcastle fan and I remember how bad luke de jong was for us and when I found out he signed for Barca I was in shock
The board hates him but they can't afford to sack him. He paid for his own release from his previous job. Barca promised him that back if they got rid of him before his contact is up.
Benfica ❤️❤️❤️
The only man who can save barca is not messi is xavi we need him more then anything right now koeman has to go
Benfica caralho!!
Think even Tottenham could beat Barcelona atm
BT be slower then VAR
Ronald koeman is a terrible manager with a terrible fixation on Dutch players who let's be honest have been shocking for the last decade or so. Messi, suarez and naymar to De Jong x2 😂😂, club is in tatters.
Incredibly empty stadium for a champions league game.
Garcia left city for this
Koeman has a huge job rebuilding this team after the departure of not just Messi, but also Suarez, which was a mistake. There just isn't the quality in the offensive positions. Tbf Barca have suffered worse defeats in the last couple of years, but against better quality teams like Liverpool, Bayern and Roma. Benfica are decent, but not a top European side.
Benficaaaa 🔴⚪🦅 we have a good team this year, hopefully we can build up to a good campaign
when a team loses, it's the manager's fault but when they win, it's the players that done well !
I feel bad for pedri and Frenkie de jong they are the only players that actually try do something in that Barca team
Was that joe Linton in disguise upfront for Barca. It was a challenge to miss
Koemen deserves to stay longer it's the players fault
Ser Benfiquista / É ter na alma a chama imensa / Que nos conquista / E leva à palma a luz imensa , etc etc  🦅 ❤️🎤🎼🇵🇹
From luis Suarez to luuk de jong, just shows how far the mighty have fallen
Benfica!
Barcenal
Luuk De Jong was terrible for us at Newcastle! Bonkers a player of his level plays for Barca 🤦‍♂️
Joy for Barcelona??? 😂😂😂
Take Conte, get rid of this joker!
@7.30 “joy for Barcelona, joy for Benfica  but anything but for Barcelona
How is Luuk de jong starting for Barcelona 😂😂😂😂😂😂 No wonder they are in this state
Barca and real Madrid have become a joke.
Barcelona have been absolutely terrible this season
Barcelona without messi has just exposed how god awful they really are (for barca standards that is)
Barcelona deserve this. thats all im gonna say. hehe
Barca ain't in debt anymore so that's a first
So good to see this pathetic team and their pathetic fans in misery.  Pique and Busquets are embarrassing. Barca's run of trophies has come to an end. Their recent success will never be repeated in a 100 years.  What are the chances of having similar once-in-a-lifetime players like Xavi, Iniesta and Messi all in the same team - absolutely no chance and therefore no chance of success again.
How has koaman not been sacked yet jesus barca are a laughing stock right now 😂
Yes Koeman holds accountability but my god these barca players cannot finish😂😂
That Nunez has some quality hold up play. The way he uses his body and bullies the center backs is brilliant.
Spanish football in the mud 😂😂😂😂
Barcelona getting it so wrong atm that even the colours next to there name on score are wrong. It's defo yellow yellow and not yellow red
At thus rate barca won't even be in the europa league 🤣🤣🤣
“Joy for Barcelona, joy for benfica but anything but for Barcelona”
And now Laliga have slashed Barca's budget.  They are in trouble
Love this Barcelona team x
🇵🇹🇵🇹
oh how the mighty have fallen.
Still don't understand why West Ham never signed Joao Mario. I thought he was very good for us when he was on loan.
It's been a while since Barca were this average. But this isnt on Koeman so much. This is an average team low on confidence.
Problem is they ( barca have become a TOOTHLESS tiger ) .. as koeman has made the team a democracy .. with no killler strikers .. with ice in there veins
What the f*ck are keepers thinking? 🤣
barcelona are washed up team all their talent is not worth a penny in my book
Ter stegen 🤣🤣🤣🤣… when he came out steve’s commentary made me laugh sooo much
7:28 ‘Joy for Barcelona’ 7:32 ‘Anything but for Barcelona’
That Nunez looks to be a top player, Uruguay continue to produce top strikers.
Barca in the mud hahahahahahaha Liverpool finished that Tinpot club
7:27 "Joy for Barcelona".. I'm sure it is 😂
Let's all laugh at Barca, let's all laugh at Barca! La laa laa la
Sinking ship Spainish football. Kloppstradamus predicted this.
Good to see Benfica doing well in the CL - long overdue imo. Always seems to be Porto, but never Benfica. Maybe they can finally lift the curse of Bela?   As for Barcelona, well I think they need a spell in the wilderness for a while. For their own good if anything.
Wow
Luuk de Jong has to be the worst signing of all time. I'd take Bebe over this amateur.
Its bercelona by name but not by nature
It's crazy to see just how far and fast Barcelona have fallen. Could easily be the next AC Milan or Liverpool, struggling for a decade or more
Koeman will be gone tomorrow.
Frenkie, fati and pedri need a new club ASAP
6:22 Danny Aarons making everyone say Sergio dest instead of sergiño
Barca are no longer a force just like man united
Luke de Jong the new Bendtner
Barca letting Suarez go to Atletico for free and then signing De Jong has to be one of the biggest Ls in football history. Not to mention losing the goat😂
Xavi will come back to coach Barca and lead them to glory once again.
De Jong's performance was comical. Fati and Coutinho on the bench watching and probably laughing whilst the game unfolded. Koeman is a very overrated manager; always goes to what he knows, which is buy dutch players because he knows no better. I hope he stays and sinks Barcelona with their debt.
Luke de jong is the biggest fraud footballer since Ali Dahi
Never seen a club crumble so much in a few years, sad times.
How bad have Barcelona become since letting Messi go...like seriously they might not even make Europa League at this point..Days of Dominance is well and truly over!
Ter Stegan and Frenkie need to leave, way too good for Barcelona. Depay aswell made a big mistake
First Barca fans piling on Real Madrid and now this. I'm not even a fan of either but this is jokes. Barca fans deserved this.
I’d rather we come 4th than play in the Europa, although at this point it would be funny AF
Damn Barca are in a bad place.. I support Man Utd and I can’t think of too many players I would want from their 11. That’s alarming
Darwin's theory was too much for Barcelona
Koeman literaly makes Barca so bad it’s like if he’s betraying them
Never forget ....it was Liverpool who broke Barcelona
Lisbon is red ….;P Sporting who ?
Barcelona:Nothing scares me,bit that thing there,I start shivering Lisbon:First Time😏
Pedri is an absolute baller
That corner taken quickly by trent... Killed barca! Never been the same team since.
Love seeing Barcelona being pumped in the Celtic way
spanish teams are abit of an embaressment at the moment
It’s sad to see what’s happening with barca but honestly I’m jus happy Leo is away from this toxic situation
Luuk De Jong has got to be the worst signing ever guy can't even finish he's the next Morata 😂
How coutinho can’t get into this Barca team I will never know
Is frenkie de jong playing well like that every game?. He looks like he’s carrying Barcelona from this video. I don’t watch Barca games idk
It’s hard to watch Barca In such a bad state😅
It's like for the first goal the guy was taking the piss with the biggest step-over he could possibly do.
Benfica not getting enough credit… clearly most people on the comments didn’t watch the game
How far have Barcelona fallen, and how quickly! Koeman is toxic right now.
7:27 Joy for Barcelona?
Estadio de Luz will forever haunt Barcelona
The fact that luuk de jong plays for FC BARCELONA just proves that anyone can make it in football
Koeman great player. Manager not so much.
Barcelona can’t afford to sack Koeman. They stuck with him until his contract ends 🤣
"Joy for Barcelona, Joy for Benefica"
benfica have 6 games in this champion league  season and still undefeated so this came as no surprise
Every "big" club on the planet goes through a period of transition, which in-turn makes them less successful, but right now Barca are in a right slump!!!
I don’t understand why stadiums aren’t being filled up all across Europe yet? Are we really going to keep saying this is all for a disease that doesn’t even have a 1% mortality rate! Never seen something so pathetic in my whole life.
And Barcelona and Real Madrid wanted to play in the Super League this season😂
I didn’t think barca could sign a worse striker than Braithewaite… once again they proved me wrong
Think it's safe to say this isn't Barcelona's favourite stadium to play in
Replacing Messi with Luuk De Jong makes replacing Suarez with Rickie Lambert look like a good deal.
“Joy for Barcelona “🤣🤣🤣
Frenkie de Jong hands it on a plate for him and luuk de Jong still misses both times 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Love seeing the state of Barcelona 😍😍😍
Barca haha.
Never thought I'd say this about Barca. But Some of these players need a better club. Depay and Pedri are both wasted there
barca got smoked🤣🤣🤣
Barca is finished
It was better for de Jong to try score himself lmao 🤣  Luuk de Jong literally the worst player ever lmao 🤣   He even blocked the first shot from Pedri   Koeman was begging for him as well lmao 🤣
People will blame Koeman but he is only half the problem, problem is how and why the board got the club in this state, plus as a result Barcelona have been left absolutely no choice but to keep Koeman
can't lie, this makes me sad to see barca this deep in the dumps
Taraabt on the pitch beating Barca 3-0 💀
“Joy for Barcelona… Joy for Benfica” 7:28
Ter stegen was doing a Manual neuer 😅
Joy for Barcelona, joy for benfica?   What is this commentary 😂
BENFICAAAA CARALHOOOOOOO ❤️❤️❤️❤️
How everyone used to say “But messi has world class players around him and that’s why it’s easy for him” .. well Barca what happened?
I mean I know barca ain't having good times but wtf with that starting 11 koeman needs to go back to Holland and study cruyff 😣
Luke De Jong with some of the worst finishing I’ve ever seen😂
Pen scored then “joy for Barcelona” 7:28
"I used to play for Barcelona" - Ronald Koeman "I was terrible when I managed Barcelona" - Also Ronald Koeman
Spanish football is looking really dull isn't it?
This is probably the lowest of the low for La Liga.
How luuk de jong is playing for barcelona is beyond me………
Koeman is the right man for the job. Just trust the process.
Barcelona look trash, but would still beat spurs 😂
Barcelona need big fat headed sam
Mad how Koeman's Barcelona would lose to Koeman's Southampton
First Porto's gk now Ter-Stegen. GK's need to stop watching Neuer.
Benfica had an impeccable performance, yet nobody talks about it... it is a shame...
7:28 joy for barcelona,  joy for benfica?🤔
Luuk De Jong wants to be ashamed of himself with some of those misses... DO YOUR JOB.
This Barcelona team is unrecognizable.
Luuk de Jong is the worst number 9 in Barcelona History...first game he played was a disgraceful performance from a professional footballer. Can't believe he has topped that by missing two open goals in this match!
Barcelona are dusted
Luuk de jong moves at the speed of dark
Nunez is so raw and aggressive. He will be up there with the likes of Mbappe and Haaland soon.
Benfica playin tikitaka instead of Barca  The world is comin to an end Lol
7:28 joy for Barcelona 😂😂
I'd rather chew drywall than listen to these commentators. More moisture in drywall.
As an Arsenal fan even I'd be confident if beating Barcelona right now
Whoever gave Koeman his coaching license needs to be arrested for being an accessory to fraud.
Joy for Barcalona?
NEVER DISRESPECT US 🦅🦅🦅
Barcelona are gonna be even more screwed next season when all the decent players leave and they can't attract anyone else
Koeman got to go 🤣🤣
Franke de jong is class
Feel so sorry for Pedri, does all these good passes but no one finishes them. Just appualing from FCB, how is Koeman still in
Ter Stegen taking lessons from the Porto keeper last night.
upload the united highlights
Barcelona in the mud
7:29 the commentator tweaking
Luuk De Jong is AWFUL hahhahahahahahahhah
How the mighty have fallen
Now that Messi has gone the Spanish league is finished
*How the mighty have fallen*
I miss the old Barca and Madrid
Luke dejong was so bad.
One de jong was superb, the other had a howler
Signing Luke de Jong is a sackable offence on it's own. He might be the worst professional footballer I've ever seen
The era of Spanish football is over. Can't say I'm not pleased
How is Eric Garcia playing for Barca? He's nowhere near good enough.
Barcelona to go out at the group stage?
“Joy for Barcelona” 🤣🤣🤣
“Joy for Barcelona”😂😂😂
No messi- no results
7:28 joy for Barcelona???
Barcelona have turned into a poor mans Arsenal 😂
La liga getting embarrassed Atleti were lucky
These are dark days for Barcelona
Why did barcelona buy luuk de jong
That’s Koeman gone and hello Xavi
🤣🤣🤣
This barcelona time is too weak 4 champions league
Ansu fati the next messi 🤣🤣  Definitely keep koeman, its just hilarious watching barcelona screw up
Everyone talking about how poor Barcelona were.  Benfica were excellent tonight, shame that won't be spoken about enough
Never expected we would win but let’s go hahaha, Barca is my second favourite team but since Messi left they don’t have a chance anyway lol VAMOOOOO
What’s up with the goal keepers this week 🤣🤣
3:36 Wait I thought I was playing FIFA and held onto 🔺️ 🤣😂🤣😂😅
the guy in the thumbnail looks like he has wings on his back
This is horrible
Bt sport is doing to united fans what they did to city fans last time by not uploading the highlights 😂😂😂😂😂
Wouldn’t be surprised if Koemans sacked tomorrow.
Im concerned about spanish football at the moment.. i mean its nice to see amazing teams get beaten and for the teams no one really talks about to win but whats happened to real Madrid and barca?
Worst Barcelons side I have ever seen. (What a load of TOSH !)
luke de jong just sums up Barcelona right now.
Monstrous step overs before the first goal
7:28 joy for “Barcelona, joy for benfica” 🤣
Konman has done it again.. back to the Dutch league fraud manager
How the mighty have fallen
Barca are finished.
I said Baraclona would win nothing this season. I know for a fact la Liga and the UCL have already gone. Over they next 5 years they will struggle to balance debt with players and winning. Would not be surprised if they ended up in the new conference league at one stage
BT getting these highlights out slower than the line at shell this morning
Imagine  Madrid Vs Barca final 2022!!! In Europa that is 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
If xavi ever becomes manager for Barca they’ll have great success
Barca deserve everything they get. Horribly run club. How on earth have they managed to get themselves in this situation...
Is this the same Barca side from years ago? Wow! The only thing similar is the badge.
Koeman deserves this, never liked how he treats certain players (Niasse/Umtiti)
Aight… Now Man U highlights :)
Upload man utd highlights already
👀
Put the flipping United highlights we're all waiting for
I feel sorry for Barcelona if I'm honest.  I have enjoyed watching them play for many years because of the fabulous players they had.  They biggest problem they have is Sunday league players like de Jong and Braithwaite.  If they could invest in a Kane or Haaland, they could be back at the top, although they will never be the dazzling Barca of 2010 - 2015
Upload the man u game pls
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL Love seeing Barca fall like this, always hated them and their cocky ways
This shows that messi carried them all these years
Barca in the europa league. Who would have thought it
I’m just refreshing to see United vs Villarreal 😭
Everyone here for United hurry up ffs
POV : your waiting for the United highlights
Imagine if Barca drop into Europa league or even worse finish 4th They’re on 0 points and still have to face Bayern again
How Koeman is still in a job is beyond me. Coventry city would give Barcelona a good game at the minute🤣
it’s going to be embarrassing when they play bayern
Oh how the mighty have fallen
This isn't United highlights
Where's the United highlights?????
still waiting for the man united highlights💀
Forget this rubbish bring the United highlights nowww
Barcelona is the new arsenal 😂
Ohh its a good day.. barce deserve this been scamming clubs and football for far too long.
Utd highlights ya divs.... U a UK channel playing non UK 1st... Idiots
Koeman should’ve been sacked a while ago. Barca obviously just went with the cheap option 🤨
R.I.P Barcelona Football Club
Jeeze! Koeman won’t have long left now! ☹️
Koemans got to be finished now surely
Barcelona is finished Messi must be glad he left before this humiliation. 😁
They might be strategically trying to enter the Europa League so they can win a title 😂
Sacked in the morning, he’s getting sacked in the morning
I guess Messi really was mes que un club
Seems like Barcelona players want Xavi more than the board do 😂
It’s just laughable at this point
Barcelona just got f**ked up men
Koeman wouldn’t even be able to convince my dad to go get milk from the shops lmao
barcelona are in the water
UNITED HIGHLIGHTS NOWWWW
Sad to see Barca like this these days
Can't believe Barca still haven't sacked this man 🤦‍♂️
Naaaah, BT sport are doing this on purpose…United game?
Nothing without messi
L
Barcelona such a washed club
Barca might scrape europa league
Finished club
Barcelona should sign Nunez top talent 😳
We are all here refreshing to see ronaldo come on already bt 🥴

💀
How the might Barcelona has fallen…
Barca are seriously in trouble they need to sort this mess out.
