I just realised I they started in the COVID-19 that was 2020 that is really sus
Hi Matt
Its none of our business what it cost. They all are happy and a very loving family. let them enjoy their fun without anyone wondering the cost. What a fun family and I really love this family. Who has more fun and love than they do? Bless them.
Just my opinion. Your house needs color. The wood on the top of your porches need to be alot darker. The white of the outside needs color too
I love watching ppl who work their butts off achieve their goals & dreams. 🤗
Meredith has very good taste! Please tell me the model of your refrigerator?
👍👍👍☀️☀️☀️🇫🇷🏊‍♂️🏊‍♀️✨
Isn't that gas range like 10k
Why doesn't Mere get a toy? Like a luxury sports car or something, or maybe a horse if she likes them.
Can’t wait for then just start watching most done this house is incredible many blessing
Matt! I love your videos but the jerky camera work makes me so sick I can only watch 5 minutes at a time! Start doing smoother transitions and no fast switch from looking at you and looking at other stuff!
I would put a playground in the circle  but i have younger kids lol
Matt put a water feature in the middle of the driveway
Does Mare get excited about anything ? LOL
Hey why have you kept that little bit of random wall they previous owners built out the front of the house on the left?
mares face is copper brown and her neck is snow white? is she ok?
Nice to see you bought a fridge built here in Iowa at our plant
I wish I could jump 2-3 years forward into future and see the house totally finished
Yoo!???? how much was that house in all.... That fridge 😍😍😍
Matt one of these days Meredith is going to give you a shtick I’d a shtick or a snip pity snip for your toys budget
This is why you go to college folks!!
What brand is the fridge?
just curious what drone do you use?
You guys worked your asses off for what you have. You suffered loss and pain. I know the pain 3 times . You fought for your future and your future is here now enjoy it and now you are making a future for your children and wife. Good luck guys . Tommy from Boston
Hey mate I have a suggestion for the oval in the middle of your driveway because you are into cars get a old rust car and put it in the middle with old fuel pump next to it stuff like that
matt is the best
7:46 Don't fear the Tile Mere.
How about a helipad in the round area of the driveway? :p
Mullet
I think a Koi pond in the middle would be really neat,.
Any risk of landslide ?
Way to go Matty!!!
Look at my idea, put lights like at the airport, in the middle, corners. On top on the mountain. My dream for your house.
Jezz Matt??? From this Husk of an old Mansion to this remarkable build!! Looking great!
I've been watching these "mansion renovation" about 2 years ago. Wow, and now it's done.
Been saying since the project started; That center of the driveway needs to be a small pond, with an island in the middle, and a big ass cannon sitting on the island.. pointed right down the front gate.
We need a BUNKER update!
In colorado we can't call that pollen but a brown cloud. Miss the 80s front range.
Nature wallkkkkkk
He definitely deserves his brothers bronco. Hopefully he can finish it up with some paint and stuff make it insanely clean
Man you did a awesome job on the house  a lot of work but you pulled it off wow I love it
Run some pipes to the middle , so you can run electricity and water or something else below the driveway. Saves a lot of headaches even if you aren't planning to do anything there. Plans change.
This is in Austin, Texas?
😎🍺🔥
Matt I still don’t see a swimming pool on the roof
Put a fountain in the middle of the driveway!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Man it's pretty cool how I got to see the transformation of the mansion. Just to see it come from nothing to the beautiful structure it is now is a blessing and I can only imagine wat it's like for you. You are a big motivation and gotta be 1 of my top 3 favorite YouTuber.  Hope to make some content with you one day.
Hey mate your how has 5 bedrooms so its a mansion so u can call it the demolition mansion!!  like so he can see this comment so we get that name.
Plus when your finished you need to build an amazing fence that goes around the property how sick would that look.
That's going to look so amazing when you finally get it all done. Love the view.
10k friends? just 10k friends? Not 4.15M friends??
hay man please fix the camera gittery that happens when it shakes it brings me headaks a but lode of times.
Show gun room
Samsung and decor are the worst appliances!!! 😫 I fix appliances  for a living....please do some research  about them and return them if possible
You´re living the dream dude!
What’s happening with the original demolition ranch property?
That's an incredible place. Loved the videos showing all the work. Happy for y'all.
Demolition Manor is looking good 😎
Dang can y’all adopt me
Man I'm really glad for you guys. I bet this stuff is stressful but its gonna be so worth it.
Dang it that place is beautiful. I manage at a landscaping company in Longview and can visualize everything you’re saying. Check out Arizona cypress trees, they’ll do well in your climate.
Wow looks expensive
Burn the Cedars in Texas.  For those that don't know, they are an invasive species, they strangle out native species, they are weak wood and short lived and they create misery for the millions who are allergic to their winter pollen.  Probably the stuff Matt was showing at the end of the video.
Put a pond in the circle in the middle of the driveway!! That would be epic.
Turn the middle of the circle into a basketball court
We need an update of the gun bunker under the garage.
Shrink center way down & make 2 car spot longer & wider !  Like a shop, make bigger than you think & it will still be too small
Noooooo not a mullet! 😅😭
A weeping willow in the middle of the driveway
crazy fridge!!!!!
5:49 you must be really happy
Wow, Matt, you guys went all in!
Da house gettin there..
Don’t sell the Bronco
Ahh how wonderful..the joys of being rich…can’t relate cause I’m poor
The fridge matching the cabinets. That is already decades usual in Europe.
Fountain in the middle of the circle!!
He tells us don't tell mere but mere knows before us lol
The real flex is having a driveway so that you don't have to back a trailer. That's how you know you made it in life!
That is such a nice Over watch
What kind of backsplash is that above the range?
Mere is a fricking boss. You go girl.  Happy life happy wife.  Getrdone Matt
Enjoying your new house journey!
USE THIS AS A LIKE BUTTON FOR MATT TO PUT LIFE SIZED VERSION ON THE FAMILY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DRIVEWAY AS A BRONZE STATUE
The oval on the middle isn’t symmetric and it’s driving me crazy.
Dat YouTube money's lol
That middle circle of the driveway is perfect for a go kart track 😅
That backyard needs a Lucas Lagoon! Love how it's all coming along.
I haven’t watched ANY progress videos since you bought this abandoned place when it was just studs and shredded looking insulation… my jaw dropped looking at the tour with it almost finished. WOW.
Holy cow that's quite the house. Damn
Matt, you should be a putt putt course in the middle of the driveway for the kids.
crazy just too see a year of work
Are you ever moving in?
Big Buenos Dias
Giant Firepit into the circle :D
Matt I can help you get the sod for a better price than if you get the landscape company to get it I work with the grass farms in the San Antonio area I deliver sod for a living and get better prices than they will give you. I’m sure you’re going to use siteone or a landscape company like that and we work with them on the deliveries. Let me know if you see this
Commented
Think you should have a Big Bunker branding logo in the Centre circle ❤❤
I love Matts energy for this house! Mere always seems so apathetic about the entire thing :c If I could afford to build a brand new house from, literal nothing, for my wife, she'd be doing cartwheels around the house LMAO
God has truly blessed you!
More Mere videos or her own channel aswell please
Hey don't forget the pond! Call Greg Whitsock the pond guy
Dang all that time on the bronco just to sell it why would you do that
You guys should do an orchard for the kids
This guy is so going to be bankrupt in a couple years.
Is Lincoln's haircut technically child abuse?
That backyard is so huge and the pool looks so small (I'm sure it's not). But I am loving how everything is coming together. I started watching your channel when you found the house. Can't wait until everything is done!
This has been an amazing journey. I'm thankful for youtubers like you that feel close to family.
Build a zip wire to the bottom of the valley!
You need a pond in the middle of the driveway
Mere gives me negative nancy vibes every video
This house will be so beautiful when it's finished.
Why the music and drone footage giving me cribs vibes
Hey Matt......is that grey hairs I see??
Yeah right Matt the emotional loss..lmao and I suppose you will need a new pew pew also to go along with the new vehicle…hey might as well try..lol
The mullet on that kid, lady stealer.
Great idea get Greg the pond guy to build you a rec pond in the front
You are spending more for your driveway area than my house cost. No doubt. Lol. I'm happy for you though, can't believe what this property used to be.
You should do a Koi pond water feature in the Middle of the round driveway
More like 14 million friends Matt lol well between your 2 channels .
Why the hell would you want your fridge water to be on the inside of the fridge?
I'm not gonna lie when big boss Matt said he was thinkin about getting the mansion I never thought it would happen. I have never been happier to me be wrong.
Gotta put a fountain in the middle. Maybe one shaped like a pew pew
Greg Whittstock from Team AquaScape could really make the circle in the driveway epic with a great rec/koi pond with waterfalls 😉
mate realy good request you should make some sort of feld in the oval of the driveway to play ball
Don't forget to video the driveway pour, the best part!
Did the camera movements give anyone else motion sickness??🤢
Uh oh Matt has Corona
What is the name of that song during the drone footage
Is Eric pouring your concrete?
Instead of putting a regular door in for the Pantry you could possibly order some more cabinetry and continue that down and put a hidden door in that looks like it’s the cabinets seen that a few times pretty cool and seamless!
"Alaska's Alaska right now"
Put a koi pond in the middle.
I see a great personal go cart track and you know what that means….go carts to replace the bronco 😂
I’m down in Texas for a week to see a football game down here is beautiful
She nailed exactly my first thought during the drone shot to open the video, that parking area on the left is too small. I also agree with having power installed now in that center area!!!
That place is really coming along.  I haven't watched an update in 4 or 5 months and it's impressive.  It's a lot whiter than I expected.
(Puts on Tin Foil hat) Don't be fooled ladies and gents that "Haze" is covid being spread by the government. An Ex CIA guy told me about it.
Awesome to see it getting finished
What goes in the middle? I know- put like this mountain/hill looking thing! …….
I didnt get notifications for this video.. I followed this series from day one.
God bless ur new home Matt..
What are you going to do with the title you took out in the beginning
So what I see is Mere is the perfect wife, beautiful and puts up with your craziness. Well done Matt.
Just a thought, I know you sometimes get deliveries via semi trucks and that island might be an issue
Dang guys! Looking great!
DUDE THAT VIEW THO!!!!
Me: Looks like a nice part of Texas around there to move to. Me: [sees pollen in air] Me: So... Alaska is looking good!
You say driveway... I say go-kart speedway! 😂
I can't believe I havent been subscribed!! This while f#@king time! I'm sorry lol but I'm subscribed now
Let me do your landscaping I’m a professional landscaper
Been watching this since the first episode I'm so excited to see it finished. Good Luck 🤙
I deliver appliances and that's a Sidekick they can be a pain in the ass to install.
Looks awesome 👌 Glad you made the purchase and put in all that work.
Matt, you've gotta call Aquascape to put a pond or waterfall in that driveway circle!
It's missing something: A short private runway for Bush planes. lol
So now you need another old 4x4 to replace the Bronco.
The view from there is just unreal.
6:51 you've unlocked a memory I didn't know I had anymore
Matt, that’s a stunning looking place already man. Congrats to you and your family.
You should put a look out tower in the center of the driveway that extends above the height of the house.
Please buy a drag car or a drag car project please
Crepe myrtles are beautiful trees. We love ‘em here in Houston
Why not make the center part some sort of out door area, like, a lil 'home' for outside events in case, stuff like star gazing or something, a little hang out spot
Didn't the bronco belong to your friend who died though 😢 why would you get rid of it
Make sure they pour a helipad. You know thats in your future.
Since your channel is based off guns you need an armory and a place to work on your guns
I remember when they were tearing rotted wood out and now they’re almost moved in 👍🏽
Man look at that mullet his boy has it look really good it fits him alot, love the house and everything else Matt great work keep it up
You have a beautiful house. Do you have any plans to install solar pannels? I think that would be good for your electricity bill and also good for the environment. I think people would be interested to see that too. Thanks
Just WOW it is going to be soo AWESOME when it’s finished
I want to be Matt’s friend so I can shoot the 50bmg<3
Need pipes under driveway and walkways for irrigation, wiring etc....
You should get solar panels. Save a lot on electricity.
10,000 friends!!! Dude you got MILLIONS!!!! lol
6:25 the way she softly slapped her son XD this family is so much fun to watch! lovin this journey,
Love the new house
Love your new pantry
I love how your fridge looks like a cupboard that's so awesome. Mar's gonna get you.
1:25 In the center, plant rows of flowers, so it will look like an Easter egg! There, I just gave you a spring project idea!
Ummm, my helipad. I might wanna fly my choppa to see ya!
I thought it was hilarious how Matt got Lincoln to press the water button in the fridge instead of him so he didn't get too much in trouble. I also love the "are you serious" look that Mere gave towards Matt after Lincoln pushed the button.
What no seat belt for a child??? I can’t believe you would a) do it but  b) much less film it and show it.  Wow.
Congrats on the house, and hopefully it all goes smooth sailing.
Cool!!
Put a tree house in the middle!!
that view is amazing
Hey Matt, make the center circle area turf for your kids. I’m a kid so I would personally love that
Driving up to alaska isn’t that bad, it’s a lot of fun.
should do saloon doors on the pantry..make it high and low enough to not see in  but easy enough to walk in and out with hands full
That's going to be an awesome driveway
The pool was be cool once it finish and a cool biggest water slide to put in
water fountain in the center of the circle!!!!!!!!
Is it just me or does his wife seem annoyed by him
Can we get a Cuda update
Great video!
I just remembered that I go back to school tomorrow and what better way to spend it than watching you shoot pew pews for an hour lol
Man those Babies gotten so Big There going to be asking for those Car keys before you know it !
Thats Smoke Haze !
6:24 such a cute moment 😂😂
Okay when’s the move in, this has been a crazy transformation since the beginning
It so fun to see the progress...I'm looking forward to the interior tour (crossing my fingers that Mer is not afraid of color to the point that it's beige/white - everywhere)  Bring on the color, texture, warmth and visual interest!
Man. If only I had a thought to record me shooting shit after I saw fps. Russia and I'd be rich
Go kart track driveway
Daaang! You got a Carrier Infinity on a new house?! Glad your contractor actually cares about the Mechanical stuff too ❤️
I was wonder does anyone know what their careers are? I’m 22 in college so I’m just trying to see what they did so be successful
Driveways looking sick! I would extended the pad on the side of the garage more back for storing trailers & stuff
Your kids are getting so big enjoy them when they are young it goes fast
You should do pavers instead
He needs to build a secret tunnel system to another massive bunker house in a different state or Canada
Dear Matt  my name is Andrew I am one of your amazing wonderful fans I wanted to ask if you can come to South Africa and surprise me at school with a go kart please
Dear Matt my name is Andrew I am one of your amazing wonderful fans I wanted to ask if you can come to South Africa and surprise me at school with a go kart please
What’s the cracking on the call by the switch in the kitchen you showed?
You should put a big ass fountain in the middle
Should do a big water feature in the middle of the circle!!
Make a chicken coop in the middel of the egg 😁
when the next video please
No fountain in middle?
Now's the time to run Conduits everywhere and mark them for Future stuff...
Big house to begin with and you made it bigger?
The first i thought was that little parking spot needs to be a little deeper lol
So exciting to see it all
Better be a blazer like your moms to replace the bronco
What a great place to grow up in.
we get it. youre rich.
Can we see bunkerbranding in 2022?
Yo how long have you actually had the house I feel like it’s been a really long time
Did you run your irrigation lines to the Circle center?
Y’all are so lucky 🍀 but I do want to see if you can see your house from town or bottom of the hill? Can you show us?
HAPPY NEW YEAR 2022
them girls had me nervous at about 9:40 jumping off that block with that rebar sticking up over the end of the bottom block maybe I'm just getting old
You should fly out a random subscriber to your range to shoot some guns. (Random subscriber means me)
that fridge looks like a gun safe. Only Matt would get a fridge that looks like a gun safe.
You better put a big ass fountain in the middle, with guns shooting out the water.
You may have covered this already. However, have you met/talked to the previous owners? I wonder if they kept up on your progress on the house. And their thoughts.
You should put a koi pond in that oval space of your driveway
I really wish your 10k friends include me so that i can visit your house :p. but that is just a dream lol. you have a really BIG and i'm very sure it will be a nice house!!!!!!!! thank you for sharing the journey with everyone.
tint the soil green like lawns in California lol
Hair cut and shave shaggy :p
Keeps getting better!
That radius is really tight for a trailer, I would reduce the inner green space by another 3 feet in diameter.
would be pretty awesome if you put a fountain or a pond in the middle of the driveway
You should do a helipad in the center of the driveway so you can park your Apache helicopter ahah
Plant some niyog
11:00 we’d have been pissed if you sold Tyler’s bronco
I love seeing rich people decorate their houses....motivates me to also do more and get rich. However, i seem to be spending my time watching these video's....i'm sure i'm doing something wrong, but what is it...
The driveway circle is too big. Put a shortcut access to the garage in the middle of this area, this also avoids clogging the entrance with vehicles.  I'm surprised the designer/shop? did not include spacers in the design for "shoulder room" for stove or any out-swing doors. This is usually a 3/4 to an inch spacer.  This also goes for any cabinets that are next to a wall.  A fix would be to make the cabinet doors next to the stove, flush mounted. This would be a relatively easy fix, but requires the door to be cut and repainted. A harder fix would be to cut the opening larger and leave the door alone. It wouldn't match all the other cabinets, but you could completely open the stove. I don't think anyone will notice unless you point it out. The stove would still stay as it is though.
So you gonna invite 10,000 of your favorite subscribers to the house warming party?
That's not pollen in the air fam. Its just 4:20 and you forgot to check your watch.
You should put a pond with trees around it
You need to put a great big lighted sign it says pew pew on top of the cross oh yeah
In my 2 years of me watching your videos I have never seen you edit a meme into your video before. EVER.
*Tile in that room off of the kitchen is ENTIRELY too busy! you're going to get tired of that quickly and want to replace it within a year! That tile was meant to be more of a border line or accent piece on another plainer tile wall. I like the pool tiles those look like they'll be easy on your feet too. Would have been neat if they made those in a clear or colored glass maybe even one with a mirrored backing so it has little beams of light reflecting off of your pool lights just like a Rolls Royce Headliner does with the starlight headliners.  main thing though fix that entrance and exit on your driveway now it's too narrow on that end. and you won't get to fix it later without it costing a small fortune. if you want 2 cars width that should carry around the entirety of the oval to keep everything symetrical and flowing as it should with a house of this magnitude*
Hear me out, use the circle in your driveway as a go kart track
Driveway looks like an oval race track
Is it wide enough to drift around it?
If you're going to landscape that circle, run an irrigation stub before they pour the driveway.
Love the driveway idea, however if you make it all one big circle of blacktop, the kids could ride go carts or play basketball in the middle, plus think of how easy moving trailers or having people over with a full driveway would make it.
That is one heck of a house.
The Ranch on the HILL!!!
Good call an the fridge
From this view now I understand why my allergies have been kicking my ass
Don't forget to run water and electrical to your landscape areas BEFORE you put in the driveway,  Need to be thinking about irrigation  and seasonal or landscape lighting.
annie: im making dirt!! matt "Nice"
mere i feel sorry for you because matt act like a kid so you have 4 kids lol
Make the radius bigger smaller center
Matt you forgot something before they do the Cement n You Forgot your Helicopter Landing Pad
Can anyone guesstimate how much that pour is going to cost? Looks massive. Almost more surface area than some parkades I have watched be poured.
Dat krib be da Mac Daddy 👨 🤪
I would way rather more parking in front of the garage and more grass in front of the house.
Lol silly matt.. couldn't that haze be from the Colorado fires? I know we had really thick smoke in MN from the Canadian wildfires.. it was horrible, the air stunk of smoke for days.. smoke got really bad for a little bit and I'm central/ southern MN.
Care to make a guess how long the concrete will be down before Matt does a burn-out around the "egg"? I give him a day.
Looking fantastic
Omg Lincoln has grown so much. I feel old all of a sudden
Have to put up a big old Purple Martin house to go with that view and property.
A giant flag pole in the middle of the circle biggest in Texas
You should put some coconut trees or palm trees in the middle with a fountain!
Good job on the kitchen 👍🏻
Wife is right about that two car parking space, not deep enough... also that round about isn't as wide you think it is, you get a couple trucks side by side and sure they might fit, and i mean might fit and if they do nobody is gonna be opening any doors... love the layout but you might think about widening things a bit all the way around...
electrician here, bury some 2"+ conduit under the driveways now even if you never plan on using it. youll be glad you did if you eve need to get a landscape wire, sprinkler pipe, what ever from one side to the other
Matt don’t forget to get a good fire clearance around the perimeter of the house. The brush looks thick. Beautiful house!
lifestyle of the rich and famous looking down on the minions in the valley  were is robin leach
Might be alot of pollen but dang, look at that view.
Emotional loss..riiiiiiight 😆
This is the house he’s moving into right?
Alaska is being extremely Alaska right now.
how much of that land around your house is actually yours? like with all the bushes and brush and stuff
Build a pond in the middle of the driveway
The house is beautiful!
Hey Matt, me and my buddies used to smoke in your house before you bought it lol
Lord I loathe moving but after you are done it feels so good!  Knowing y'all you should probably just pave the middle as well.  Just pave the entire front area.  That way when you have all the toys at you have plenty of room.
So much room for activities
Dr.Matt, That fridge is big enough that you could keep some animal vaccines and blood samples . That flat section you talked about would make a great animal play park. YOU CAN STILL SAVE EM ALL DR. MATT!!!
she definitely married up, you know who the bread winner is in this relationship.
Matt, would you ever consider using floatplane? Would really like to subscribe to a channel there. Maybe stuff you can't do on Demo ranch but want to do?
What refrigerator is that I like it
matt are you rebarring the concrete so it doesn’t crack?
U could see the eye roll even with her glasses lmao
That pool is HUGE but still looks soooooo small in that back yard. May need to expand it a bit more. Also, a basketball court would fit too.
Door built? Mere call Andy Rawls!
It's gettin there!
You might get Greg wittstock the pond guy of Auquascape to build a sick water feature in that front egg shaped space out front.
Moscow is pronounced like the Russian one.
You should put a koi pond in the circle of the driveway
2022 so far is the worst year of my life, 3 family members of mine are in the hospital on ventilators, please send prayers for a speedy recovery to all of them
Put electrical outlets throughout the outside of the house. It will be beneficial for decorations and doing stuff for maintenance if needed
1:32only thing I could think of is race track
Should make a mega kids playground area in the center circle in the driveway.
Definitely a water feature in the centre of the round about surely 💦 💧 🚿
Your driveway is an oval for go carts...
When all your kids start driving and their driving friends come to visit. Need enough room. 😁
Matt your such a lucky man. You get all the cool guns, because your in a free state! You have a beautiful family and a very very nice new house!!!!
I hope that all of you out there searching for meaningful things receive them this new year! Happy New Year 💙
Boy is rocking a killer Tennessee water fall!
In the center of the driveway needs to be a giant waterfall statue of the Carriker family!!
Matt, in the center of your yard you can do green grass, a small flower/rose bush garden with a gondola and swing bench I think it'd look so good.
11:50 , Who else got anxiety when the girls were playing on the wall, above that metal stake. That should have a temp protector cap on it!!!
When are you going to make a baby on the roof, like you PROMISED???
What brand is that fridge? I want one now in my new kitchen!
Are you hiring ?
you need a big fountain in the middle of the driveway.
He made a drift track
I am surprised that you aren't doing solar. That hill would be a perfect place to have panels
Love how this house has come along. How is Mark's wife and kids doing? Have not heard in along while.
Help me understand why one needs/ wants a an electric fan outside? Dang Matt them kids be growin.
Make sure to throw some conduit for electrical to that center island in the driveway you’ll regret forgetting that later on! Coming out sick!!! 
Hey Matt how is the bunker in the garage holding up?
whats Mere wear in shoe size 8 or 9?
In the circle u should put a big pond with fish like Coi I hope I'm saying that right but yeah seems like a cool idea
Matt you need nets so the football  and soccer ball ⚽️ does not go over the dirt like football has
Dude don’t get rid of the bronco dude we just got it back man…. I knew you were gonna do this shit 😂
It would be cool to have flagpoles in the middle of the circle driveway one that is the demolition flag the American flag and Linc active

Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit needgod.com
I can’t believe the entire front area isn’t paved for a burnout pad.
need the name of that fridge! to hopefully ill be able to afford that in my new house im building!
Matt hear me out put a small pond it would look majestic 😂
“that’s pretty neat” I can’t breathe😂
Hey Matt we need a house construction budget video after moving in….
Jokes about being cool and having 10,000 friends....1,000,000 people show up and Mere tells him I told you we should have extended that spot 3ft.😂 Your a great guy keep up the great videos and being one of the few good YouTube role models.
Matt should totally use the drivearea middle part for making a pond with waterfall for kids.. the front would look so beautiful and a pond feature I bet the kids would love it.
build a pond or a water feature in the middle of the driveway it would be awesome
Everytime Matt walks through the house “this is a pot filler!!”
Matt you should buy a tank to replace the Bronco, we know you want one!
Can we see the pew pew safe/room all set up please 🙏
Don't know why but I am excited to see the whole thing when its done.
dont lie matt you got that driveway to race go karts
Matt you should have Meredith walk through the process of designing and making a shirt at the Bunker. It would be a great video.
Are you putting a Flag pole in the circle?
I understand that circle is for your Apache helicopter.......
Invite us to the house when it’s all ready 🤪 house party
That turn around is every UPS guys dream, gotta love a long driveway with a good wide turn around!
In the driveway what about a water fountain of you holding a big gun and the water comes out the end of the gun
Hey Matt once your driveway is done call the guys from DDE to drift their SVJ around that circle that would be awesome 🤣🤣✌
I would've played Luckenbach Texas because of the four car garage 😂😂😂😂
So cool
Ya know 🙄
I feel like a fountain would fit perfectly in the center of that driveway
For the back yard/football throwing flat areas.....consider artificial grass.....looks and feels like real grass but you don't have to cut or water it and up on that hill grass might not like to grow in constant direct Texas sun!   The driveway is giving me spy movie vibes.....when they have an arial shot of the front of a mansion at night, all lit up, with exotic cars and SUVs around the circle with a line of other high end cars arriving to drop off with the valets at the front door!!!
Matt: Very happy for you and your family!
🤠😎🧐👌👋👍😲
damn this is stressing him, dude looked like he aged 10 years since his last video.
Matt you need a fountain in that circle area.
don't forget security measures for robbers and gas leak bro, better be safe aye
Just wondering, who going to clean it?
MATT!! I cant wait for the time lapse weather rolling in shots!
Nice "View Mansion"
Am I the only one that thinks the driveway needs to be a little wider so that Matt can park his 5 ton and still have room for his other 5 ton 👀when he gets another one lol
Hey Matt, no gutters??
2022 rt wel for me and my parentes😒😭😭
<3
that driveway looks driftable
Make sure to throw some conduit for electrical to that center island in the driveway you’ll regret forgetting that later on! Coming out sick!!!
So matt how long before you drift in the driveway
Have a big tree in the middle with a tree home
This time on how Matt says he is going to fill in the backyard...
Zen garden
Room for truck and trailor my ass !    Look at Matts face ..... it has DRIFT written all over it 🤣
i do hope you'll do a fountain in the middle of the driveway cuz that's what indicates rich
A pond in the middle of your driveway area would be dope
That circle in the driveway would be perfect for rc rock crawl track
I dont know about you guys,but i see a perfect place for a tank in front of house :D
Can you guys please host a housewarming party with all the youtubers and friends from the videos
I really hope the landscaping covers up how bland the house itself looks 😂
Nice
You should put a water fountain in the middle of the driveway
Noooooo!!!! Cement. Think porous, gravel brick no run off.
I’m so happy for you guys the house is looking absolutely beautiful
So what percentage of the build cost is the landscaping?
"Prees it Link" 😈
You need to throw out the first gallon of water and two buckets of ice so you don’t drink the filter stuff.
People gonna be spying on y’all with binoculars 😆
Yeah, the driveway looks a little small for how big your rigs are. I'd bring a couple of your biggest trucks up and try parking in different places to see how it flows.
An idea, get Forest a spare part for the main areas of the Bronco. Getting parts for it has to be quite difficult in Alaska.
Don't put trees and bushes too close to the house, it's a fire hazard, and because your house is on top of a hill is more hazardous as fire moves faster uphill. Why did you get gas hotplates? Those are so inefficient! electric induction cooktop is way more efficient.
Irrigation lines for green stuff?
My allergies are going crazy just looking at that haze
#29 on trending he’ll yeah brother
I have a suggestion, uhm well it's more like an idea... since you have a pretty large property with a lot of different trees around it, I was thinking that you could build treehouse/s for your children. Or/and in the past episodes of renovation of the mansion when you wondered around your property and stumbled around small rivers or streams, you could also build a cabin or sumn like that near it. that's all, hope you notice and consider it!!
to replace the Bronco you should give the K5 Blazer
I want Mere to pick out a vehicle this time to replace the bronco. Has to be a classic.
Just got nostalgic from the neature walk😂
Happy New Yeahr :)
Yo Matt... Did you notice that Link read upside-down?
Hey Matt give us a garage and bunker update.
Im from Alaska and Alaska is being very Alaska right now
Dude, massive Bellagio style lighted and timed fountain in that egg space of your driveways. Like dancing lighted water shoots, geysers, and so on. Get super Tony Montana. Heck put a statue or something in the middle of it all. Maybe some nice water features and a bridge to walk over them. 👍🏻
How beautiful
RIP Annie after the outro.
That pool is gonna be sick
They need to move that entire driveway 10' or so away from the house. The same issues you are going to have on the right side with the 2 parking spaces and long vehicle stickout will also occur in front of your garage doors. Its not like you are lacking for space on the mountain. ;)
someone sneezed and you blamed it on pollen and not covid, the CDC will be knocking on your door to quarantine you all soon....
Pollen …I just got 8inches of snow bro
You should put a big ass like water fountain in the middle of it surrounded by like grass and bushes and stuff that would be cool as hell if you put a big ass fountain in the in the middle of the driveway in that circle that be sick like if you agree
The middle needs trees and a pond
Seek Jesus! Repent for the Kingdom is at hand! Jesus is the way! The truth! And the life! He’s the ONLY way!  Open the Bible, read and understand that we are in the last days! Put your full trust in him! Believe 1 Corinthians 15 1-4!
i noticed you did not told us "look at that view!"  1 single time in this video 😐
you need to put a tire swing in that middle driveway bit once possible
Install sleeving into the center island and anywhere else irrigation, power low voltage lighting.
Epic! Very beautiful!   Well, Mere is prettier. But its still nice.
Matt out of all the YouTube artists that I watch your house also the house you had that u just sold I love them both over anyone else. That not  so mansion little house on an hill with the most amazing 360 degrees house tops all of them love ya MATT
Wow! Can't begin to imagine how much the property taxes and home insurance is going to be. 😲
Mere: "you're so ridiculous"  Matt: "you're ridiculous"  **the camera cut out because Mere showed Matt how ridiculous she can really be after being talked to in such a manner**
Ok now that I see it from the new perspective you will not have a problem
You’re not gonna be able to get a semi thru that driveway if you ever need to.
Does anybody know what the name of that fridge is I need to get one of those
Matt get aquascape to do a nice pond for you for the front of the house
mere please do a video of you decorating the new house that would be awesome
Are you gonna be at the montana state vs north dakota state championship football game
👍
Would be cool if each of the kids planted their own tree in the circle and they could watch them grow as they grow up
6:44 Ахаха, не прошло и пары десятков лет, как до американцев НАЧАЛО доходить, что встроенный холодильник с фасадами в общем стиле кухни - это КРАСИВО! )))))  PS 6:53 но от огромного стального ящика плиты они пока ещё не готовы отказаться))))
I’ll post a picture of your old bronco in Alaska if I see. If I can 🤷🏼‍♂️
why dont you guys install pavers instead of concrete. They last longer look nicer and dont crack!!! also in the middle of the round parking lot it would look nice if you put a fountain.
Its not a vid on you tube its a vlog...it means video log
Just leave it looking like Baghdad
Is he from the south or north pollen aye sounds so northern
I love everything about what they did to the house but it’s kinda a bummer how plain the house looks from the front. So much white. Plus the silver roof. I get why they did it and it does look nice but there was something really charming about the look when they bought it. Hopefully the landscaping helps.
You should put a pipe into the island 🏝 for reticulation.
Show us the bunker matt
my favorite sport kick soccball
What's going on with the pool?
No fountain in the middle circle of the driveway?!
The most beautiful pool in the world is inside a palace and the tiles are like those only real lapis and gold trim...you're getting there...little tile by little tile!!!!
Its looking great! I cannot wait to see it next Christmas, You have to light that hill up! Hope you put lots of outside electrical outlets. You going to need them for all the decorations next year!
I'm so proud!
lol, bout 3:15 I swear I thought I heard Annie say "can we put in a thunderdome??"  I snorted a bit on that one.
Definitely could have done a single episode...
Ooo, Dad joke moment, what do you call a psychic gnome that broke out of prison? A small medium at large. Great update on this. Been watching since you kicked down the doors and were poking knives in the rot. Great to see it starting to shape up.
why even build rooms for the kids? they will be in college by the time is finished.
come on now you cant go half ass mansion you gotta have a big ass fountain in the center
Drifting needs plenty of room, build it big!!!
What’s the that pretty cool clip from
When will we get a mullet reveal?
Center grass area of the driveway needs an Aquascape water feature
Is lightning a concern at the higher elevation? I dont see any type of lightning rod ect. on roof?
ALREADY GOT RID OF THE EFFIN BRONCO?????????    WTF
If you can't use magnets to put your children's artwork on your fridge what's the point. So many of these fancy new refrigerators aren't magnetic. There's no way to put children's goofy artwork on them without tape. So people don't. The fridge should be a place to use magnets to display all sorts of stuff. It makes me sad that so many kids will have no idea about this tradition because their fancy stylistic aesthetic froo froo refrigerators aren't magnetic.
Call Joanna Gaines and see if she has a door you can buy for your kitchen!
Not sure if I missed it, but have you said how much property comes with the new house?
I’m already tired of the tile in the pantry
Looking good guys
it would be nice to make a fish pond in the middle surrounded by trees.
I guess if you mad the circle or the oval-shaped in the center smaller that would be better since it not a usable space unless for look so being smaller gives you more space and better usable space as well
Matt really loves that pot filler 😭
Link for the win pushing the water button. You owe him something to hang in a vault
that fridge is INSANE!!!
Ngl still kinda bummed they planed the little hilltop in the middle of the roundabout. Would’ve been such a signature piece, now it just kind of looks sterile.
She is right, 4 feet deeper on the driveway.
On the next episode of dragon ball z. 😂 come on Matt i need more videos
Anyone else dying to know what it actually cost matt to build such a house? Or is it just me. Congrats dude been watching since 20k subs
Hey matt Happy New Year to you and your family Gawd how far the house on the hill has came watched your channel for a very long time now but it's amazing what has happened and been achieved what a lovely fantastic family home (and dang just look at that view)
Thanks for the bronco, can't wait to pick it up.
Bro if I was you I'd carry my 50 ae
The White house on the hill. Are you doing Solar panels for power. ?? Looking good. 👍
I always thought that Matt would fix up the Bronco gift it back to the Voss family
Matt two things # 1 put a separate hot tub at the end of yours and mere’s bedroom! And #2 you need too put a 50 foot flag pole in the circle in front yard !
I see you planned for a drift circle as your driveway for when cleet comes over. lol. all seriousness It will be amazing for go karts for the kids tho. Yard is coming together tho, Looking good. One big question though how good of a well you got bc your going to have to irrigate alot being a top of a hill and with that super rocky dirt. If you don't, idk how you plan to have grass and you'll have to go with landscape plants that can handle very dry conditions (Xeriscaping).
Hey, Matt make sure you follow all of the suggestions people are giving you in the comment section. According to them you will regret it if you don't.
For the record, Matt, I’m a super big fan of the random memes in your videos when you occasionally do them. Like the quick zoom on mare (I saw that) and then of course “that’s pretty neat”. I would love to see more of this in your videos! Demo ranch as well! Like the old days when you made funny editor notes
That’s the tiniest freezer I’ve ever seen.
360RAnch View love it
You need some palm trees in the center circle and around the yard
A small waterfall or fountain would look nice in the circle.
Anybody know what fridge that is?
i don't know. that haze looks suspiciously like pm 2.5
So the ol veterans vehicle is getting to go to work again and make an epic journey to one of the most beautiful places on earth. Yeah I’m down with that is he going to vlog the trip? Go with him and make one hell of an epic edit!
Middle of your driveway make a garden for Mere with a big fountain ⛲️
So much fun watching step by step on this home thank you
MATT, PLEASE GET @AQUASCAPE TO PUT A MOUNTAIN WATERFALL IN THE MIDDLE CIRCLE OF THE DRIVEWAY 🌲💧💧
Wow, no mention of the view
Is grass gonna grow up there?  Are you going to get a sprinkler system?  How do you pump water all the way up there?
Put a fountain in the middle of the circle in your driveway
The roof should have been black. To at least give the house some contrast.
You should put a Pond in the middle of a circle
Soooooo what happened or is gonna happen to the chickens
6:41 look of death!
house gunna be amazing. awesome.. its like the cool gun that needs all of the cool attacthments.. but like you gotta register and wait hahah
looking at the pool floor tile. thinking  is it bullet proof lol
Video comment
Think about getting wires and water to the other side of the driveway.  Especially the center island of green space.
I'll tell you from experience, make the center island half as big. You'll thank me later.
nice place
link and i cant remember her name at the moment
do fake grass and a putting green. don't put trees or anything at all to block any view from any angle
That’s a damn mansion
house looks amazing
anie hello
Looks fabulous!! I would have thought you would have a smaller centre area and more driveway space, especially since you have it… this is going to be SO BLOODY AMAZING!!! 👏👏👏👏👏🙏🙏🙏
Remember to get some solar panels and batteries, so you never have to worry about a blackout.
Amazing transformation!
Nothing about a laneway. Stared at the laneway oh my God I’m so done with your channel you talk too much
Hey Matt and Mere. I have an idea. How about in your loop put a descent size fountain. Matt you could have pew pews that spray water in the fountain. Mere’s engineering can probably design one.
Do you realize that driveway will be great for midget car races?
Contractor: "how much driveway/concrete are you thinking?"  Matt: "Yes."
Not sure how far away the closest fire hydrant is to your property but maybe think about getting one installed close to the house in the case of you needing one you will have a closer water source other than the pool for FD use.
Please call Greg wittstock the pond guy and have a water feature installed lol
I love progress 😄👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼❤️
That’s pretty neat 😂😂
Burnout pad in the middle of the driveway..........
Put a big old flag Pole in the circle of that driveway and fly old glory Merica!
Before you finalize that driveway, take your biggest truck and your biggest trailer and back it around.
Your so close to move in can't wait love you all
you can fit my house inside the circle of the driveway
She seems depressed most of the time
What are the cracks in the drywall at 5:49? :S
The King of Texas... Yeah buddy
Can't wait to see you drift around the driveway
A man grinding to give his family the best the world has to offer, modern example of The American Dream.
You should put a fountain in the middle of that circle driveway. It would look amazing!
Don’t plant trees anywhere near pipes my  family had to dig up 2 pipes that busted because tree roots grew around them
Matt Make The Driveway Paver! Definitely Would Look Awesome Plus It’ll Help A Lot During Rainy Days 😃   Btw Yes Matt Did Walk Under That Ladder Twice 🪜😂 #KnockOnWood No Bad Luck To Come! 🙏 ❤️
wicked view
You should have aquascape do a pond in front in the circle for you
Circle needs a giant flag pole
Boop... that was a bad idea... lol
Next to the pool would be a sweet spot for a basketball court area
Hey Matt you should make a big pond in the middle of the driveway
But the bunquer
Get a fountain for the driveway
Id go with a pond in the center of the driveway.  You know you dont have to mow a pond.  Just sayin.
Burnouts in the middle of the driveway
That area is perfect for a big fountain lol
Amazing,  center island should be a pond to hold water =), put in huge underground water tanks now
Hey Matt buddy you need to put the caps on that rebar so there's Babies don't fall on it but other than that good job place looks great keep up the great content love your videos!
I had a minor panic when I saw Annie in the front seat but then I saw you were on the property lol
You should put a fountain in that center circle
10,000 friends? Matt you got 10,000,000
Sooo who picked out the White on White on White on Beige on White motif?
Ya'll need to bury a time capsule for 10 years while the yard isn't finished..
Good job getting the Carrier Infinity stats - they’re out of stock all over the United States right now, but especially in Texas!
You should put an rc car track in the middle of your driveway
Sweet! FWIW, if you were my best friend, I'd try hard to convince you of the wisdom of (pre-pour) A) running a 1" (or 2") electric PVC out to the oval (don't have to hook it up, just get it in the ground... B) running a 3/4" water line to the oval w/a hose bib (underground in a box; figure out what else later), and C) running sealed off pieces of 4" PVC underneath all those pours... even across the far side of the oval. Later you can run anything underground right thru the empty pipe. (Want to keep all the 4" sealed until you need it... so no water intrusion or critter homes inside.)
What’s up with all these mullets 🤦🏻‍♂️
Such a beautiful home!
6:18 that is such an empire style fridge freezer….soooooo cooool, and having 3 wonderful joyful insane kids myself…link has shot up, I bet by 13 14 he’ll be catching up to you Matt.
0:21 that look was about to go for the kill... 😆 🤣
Tell Lincoln to stop touching everything
An 🥚 ?
You should definitely have a big water feature in the island!! If not, at least run electric to it for future use.
I love this! Whoever's dream home this was, you've done way more justice to their dream! I love your family like my own! God bless you all this new year!
You should do a mixed recycled driveway with repurposed items from all around your house.
You need to inlay some black and white stones across it in a checker for a start finish line bc that would be a dope go kart track with the garage pits I’d be in heaven as a little kid (let alone adult me)!!
I have a feeling Matt and Lincoln are going to race Go-Karts around the driveway.
Thx for the vid
Looks like a four car garage but its really one, and the other three are just gun vaults!!🤣
Gosh a black tin roof would have looked awesome! 😬🤭
I cant wait till its done!!!!!!
I never thought you would sell the Bronco.  I figured it would go back to the family.
Don't forget about the firepit
needs a DR logo fountain in the front
For a new car get another bronco
It would be sick if you get aquascape to build a pond in the middle of the driveway
I want to see a water feature in the centre of that circle driveway
when the driveway is done, get cleetus over and have the demo 500, just dont tell mare
GET GREG FROM AQUASCAPE TO MAKE YOU A POND!!!
BIG @$$ Chistmas TREE in the driveway circle... Is it even a DISCUSSION??????????
What a HUGE flex
Hopefully that fridge lasts longer than three years!
It's coming together beautifully!!
Are you going to invite your parents over after you move in?
A pond with a water fall would look beautiful in the middle of the driveway
Love the house not sure if you care but make the cycle in the middle smaller so you can put a fountain that isn’t to big but not too small instead of trees
Added up the total cubic yards of concrete in that site yet?
Is that the finished look of the roof? Kinda looks strange, but the rest of the house, interior, and views are insane! Great job
Matt water and power. It looks great !
I want to be rich and  dumb like you. how do I do it.
This vid seemed kinda short. Oh well
Put a pond in the middle
For centerpiece in front why not go crazy and go with a gigant statue in the middle of a fountain of matt riding a shark like the old painting he hade at bunker 1.0 casted from all the gun shells? Hope you see this matt and give you some ideas 😉
My first thought was there’s no way you could get a full-size truck and trailer around that circle but turns out the mansion looks smaller on camera that it really is
i see ya picked the jenn air. good choice
What an amazing success story, Matt. Not bad for a doggie doc! I see a book in your future. You have a great place to create wonderful memories.
Ok the house is coming together. Love it! But one guestion (what's up with  skunk beard.)
One word.... Fountain!....... with Carriker family crest and some sort of flames shooting out for the win!!!...  hahaha! ....all jokes aside, looking amazing!! congrats on all your hard work!
OMG THE VIEW!!! WOW ITS BEAUTIFUL.
Are you putting a fountain in the front yard?
You should put a huge cherry blossom tree in the front of the mansion 🍒🌲
You otta put 1 large christmas tree in the middle and use that as ur christmas tree every year!
What about the bunker in the garage!!!
You absolutely have to get a ton of biodegradable golfballs and a driver!  Nothing beats having a beer with the boys and yeeting out balls
Make sure there is a railing on the steps going in to the pool so no one gets hurt going in to.or out.of the pool
What a fantastic view you have there.
Matt, you NEED. A water feature in the center circle of the driveway! Imagine a pondless waterfall with large stacked slate spheres (like @ Shaq’s house) and hardy palms all around the waterfall. It could be more sustainable with a rain X-change to capture rainwater to keep the basin filled.
The circle should be big enough to drift in it😎
Helicopter pad in the middle!!!!
Matt! You need a helicopter pad!
great video glhf Demolitia
place your bets... 70 or 90 truckloads :)
You should definitely put a Sherman tank in the circle of your driveway
436,171th
Okay, I get the idea of not having the water on the outside of the fridge, it preserves the look. That being said, my parents have it at their place, and it is so annoying and wasteful having to open the fridge and stand their while you fill your glass.
mer complains a lotttt lol. RELAX....
I can't wait to see the driveway put in.
You guys should do a nice stamped concrete driveway. I know you guys had some stamp work done around your pool at your old house. But you could make that driveway look awesome.
Beautiful kitchen for cooking Hello Fresh meals
Hey the floor looks blue. Like the walls looked green now the floors look blue for some reason
just an idea... but why dont u just put a single BIG tree in the center and make it dirt parking around it? maybe a fire pit there to hang with family!
You seem to have forgotten the heliport.
#marebuiltthehouse mat is the laborer 😂
On that 7ft wall you should totally put rock climbing things on it so the kids can have a fun way to climb up and down that wall.
I'm rich.... Have you noticed?
Beautiful Family, your children are thriving. Enjoy your evening and GOD BLESS.  Love From Michigan and it's a cold and snowy night 💖💖🇱🇷🇱🇷🇱🇷
Don’t forget to put pipe under driveway for your irrigation system too water the tree and grass
Would be a great video if you drove back with him and logged it.......
You need a big fountain out front in the circle.
I'm surprised your not doing a big fountain in the middle of the turn around that is a perfect spot for one
Hope you put some pipes under the driveway to the middle for lighting or water
You should do a rain catchment system on the house to use to automatically water the lawn and trees in the summer months. #tacticaladventurerthailand
The mansion is really coming along, sweet.
this build is taking forever
Sooo! I’ve been watching the rebuild from the start! I almost feel like your my brother now!   So when it’s done and you want to give it to someone like you did with the Bronco, I’m there for you Bro!!!!! Just saying! Lol
10,000 friends? You mean 10 million?!
This was honestly the video I was looking for the most
Hi Matt and Mere great video again and yand great bild of the house 😉 i wish you and family a nice evening and a Happy New Year greetings from the Netherlands and stay kiss Chiel
This house is already so beautiful love this series, kinda sad it’s coming to an end
You're gonna need more dirt........
wifey getting bouji
I wonder how long before Matt tries drifting his driveway?
You should replace the bronco with an international scout II
The progress of this is awesome
House looks great.
5:40 the wall still looks green. 😆
Not sure how, but Matt’s video quality looks closer to 4k than other pages.
Love Lincoln’s hair cut
You guys are awesome
Have you said in a previous video what’s happening with the chickens? If I missed it, I’m sorry.
Just a thought how about some fruit trees in that centre island. Not sure what you like but dwarf citrus and the like offer a good tree.
If you don't do an epic burnout around the driveway I'll be disappointed!
Minigolf in the center of the driveway would be dope
Get a dark pretty barn door for the pantry
Having been watching this series since it started as a B&E evidence video to this, makes me frustrated. That it STILL isn't done. But I've loved watching the progress.
This mountain cedar pollen is tearing me up. And I’m not even the allergy type. It’s just that thick, even up here north of Waco.
Be Texas bougie and put a fountain in the middle of your driveway! DO IT MATT!!!! JUST DO IT!!!! (Not sponsored by Nike)😂
Put a 4" PVC pipe under the driveway to use for a irrigation sleeve
Who thinks we need a before and after montage when the house is 100% all done?
Been here since episode one. Good work
My wife, and I want to know, WHEN DO YOU SLEEP? Demo ranch, Off the ranch, Vet ranch...
Hello Matt, crazy idea 😂! How about a pond in the middle circle with a nice tree and some koi fish with a bridge round the tree, just saying! Mere be like nope 🤣🤣
That dad joke was epic. 🤌🏽
The fact that you don’t have some @aquascape feature planned is a travesty. Even if it were bubbling boulders in that oval space in the driveway. Get on it dude.
You need some of the doors i just delivered to the dump. They didn’t sell for $25 for about 4 months so they along with a few lids of other stuff were dumped so my yard didn’t look like a dump.
You only had a TEENY TINY bit of chrome in you beard when this started...
Did Matt just make a hilltop house video without mentioning how awesome the view is? lol
the pool looks small. the first time i saw it i swear it was not that small
Better put a steel safty rail up on the wall so the kids dont fall 👍
😎
You should have left that mound in the middle, built a small bunker underneath it, with a pill box /sniper nest on top, and a tunnel to / from the bunker in the basement.
Put a fountain in the center of the grassy part of the driveway
Open that mouth of your driveway WAAAY Bigger bud!
Who remembers when Matt was making videos out of his backyard from his small house and worked as a vet . It's awesome to see how far you got. Good job.
In the middle of the circle in your driveway it would be neat to put an oak tree in the center so that it could grow with y'all family or some other tree that grows big. It's just a thought tho
I say put a big flag pole then build in some trees & shrubs with mulch then grass the rest
You should make a small fish pond in the middle part of the driveway
You might want to consider a water storage area under the turf in the oval driveway. Run your downpipes to it and use a solar pump for irritation  purposes. Help reduce water wastage, and minimal maintenance, send the overflow to a pond down hill that feeds into a swale system around your home.... this will help improve humidity and reduce fire risk factors
Looks awesome, but I'll bet you'll have 100k comments nitpicking while living in a dump, lol.
Google earth needs to update the pictures of the house
Matt, cobblestone, not poured concrete. Don’t ruin it with it.
Get another Bronco
Rich Folk!!!!! Problems......
Might as well dig a hole for 100 yards
Hi ! Awesome vlog! House looks great! Even better when it is all done! Cute kids ! Have a great New Year and take care all!   Deborah Manitoba Canada
"Press it, Linc." -every dad ever 😂
Matt, go with him!!!  What a blog that would be!!!!
-  👍 👍 🔧  -
Are you going to pad the rubble in the backyard so no one trips and hurts themselves.
You should get fruit and nut trees
those kids will get impaled on rebar  .....construction sites are very dangerous
He didn't say look at that view! 😲😲😲
Matt and Mere happy new year to you and your family
Sooooo close❤️
fill the fridge and freezer with water or the compressor will run constantly
What a view.
Watching in my car and the beat you used for the driveway part in the beginning bumps so hard on my speakers lol
Matt had absolutely no reason to put such a stupid hard beat in that cinematic shot. And the BASS oh my god.
Each to their own I guess, huge house and all those materialistic things do nothing for me, you can keep that. So many more important things in life other than how big ya garage is or how many bedrooms you have.
Come on put a fountain in the middle
I can't wait to watch you having to go over the hill to retrieve soccer balls.
Ngl I thought it was a bullpen or something at first lol.
TAKE THE CHICKENS WITH YOU plzzzz
Seems like a good candidate for a  rain water collection system
Should have a huge pond with fish and a fountain in the middle of the driveway.
Put a cactus garden in the middle of the roundabout
What kind of old door send me the dimensions
I'm guessing $350,000 concrete Job on driveway, Don't Tell Mare......
I watch this flamboyant rich guy acting like a hilly Billy ...   apathetic
If you need landscaping done let me know
"That's pretty neat!"  🤣🤣🤣
It looks gorgeous !
Is Link  a mommas boy? I only see him when Your wife around
If you put in landscape and Christmas lighting I bet you could see your house from the ISS. 😄🤣😂😅😆
Is there dad jokes because mom jokes aren't funny? Or moms can't do wrong? Questions of the universe
Looming Fantastic! Loving the smaller clips of the big picture to come
Put a pond in the middle of the driveway
You've got to do solar up there, man!   Just look at all that exposure!!!
This came along way. I loved it and I wish you and your family the best in 2022
WOW! Everything looks amazing.  Thank you for sharing your joy!  BUT... the driveway needs to be wider and the center circle needs to be smaller. BEFORE you do anything, especially the driveway... PLEASE CONSULT AN ARBORIST!  You will totally regret it if you don't. PLEASE widen your driveway OR AT LEAST CONSIDER THIS ADVICE.    Thank you! B~}
You should let Mere pick the next vehicle you work on
You need to speak to Alan the lawn care nut!!
jo the fridge is so cool man!
All the amazing parts of this house but I'm hung up on those kitchen appliances....dang them fancy!  I love how many steps ahead Mere is, having found completely different pool tile after her disappointment, and Matt didn't even knowing until it's arrived!
you need a BIG flag pole in the middle that would look cool.
Lets be honest... we've all been living our best life vicariously through Matt for the last two years following this epic build.
He told mere!
Can’t belive the transformation bud looks great
I love it all, good job Mere. One thing, you might wanna consider the sun reflectiveness off that round tile might be a pain to look at because of it. Idk ive had this problem with pools in my area.
New Year resolution get rid of cars
Can't wait to see the finished product!
You need a few access pipes for the center circle area for lighting and water sprinklers / dip systems etc.....under driveway to house area
You mean driveway/racetrack? You’re not fooling anyone Matt.😉

I would love to see the night sky from your new house
I have two words for you for that Center Spot. Landing pad. Four letters that would go very well with that are, Huey
Yo Matt in the circle of your driveway build a little fish pond or or water fall for nice looks
Take a trailer up there to make sure the center circle is small enough to back into all the bays of the garage incase I need to I wish the guy who built my house did it
You secretly built you a drifting track around the front of the house the center part could be like a very cool Koi pond area
Matt, on the Kenai Peninsula in AK we received just got done having around 50 degrees. My older brother and sister-in-law drove from the KPB to Michigan in around 3-4 days, driving straight though I’m pretty sure. It doesn’t take quite as long as most people think.

You gonna pave or use concrete on the driveway?
Ayy it's trending
HAPPY NEW YEAR MATT AND FAM!
Put a pond in the middle of the driveway that'd be awesome and pretty unique
Should gunite the pool as you can do any color and it helps make it less maintenance. 😉
i'm surprised there's no indoor shooting range.
So Matt who's gonna break in the driveway a good drift around the circle
Give forest cameras and everything and have him document his journey home and start a YouTube channel with it all!!
You should have Ryan from Victory Outdoor Services come down for the concrete pour of your driveway he is doing his Victory Tour  he owns a concrete company in Wisconsin and is touring the country this winter helping out a bunch of small business for his youtube channel
Your UPS guy is gonna love you for that circle. Just sayin…
I was just thinking maybe ,lay down some train tracks run it around the mansion going to and from the demorange. demoltia train, Choo choo
In the middle put a flagpole🤷🏼🇺🇸🇺🇸
How about full RV hookups ?
The circle in the middle of the driveway needs a fountain, of matt riding a shark.
I would HIGHLY recommend getting solar panels and an inverter installed Matt, it has cut my power bills down by two thirds.
Seeing the kids run around gives an idea of scale.  The place is ginormous.  We already knew that but still.  It’s been fun. Thanks.
Back pools... meh... out dated...
That's not a bad gaff. I hope it serves you well.
Won't trees in the front block you sunset and sunrise views?
Tank in the middle. The End
DAANNNGGG Look at that view!!!!😂
Perfect for mountain bike/walking trails to be built especially with 7ft drop off the back
is it polution?
I think it's really special and selfless that you're giving Forest his big brothers Bronco. So excited for all these videos. All my love from Michigan ❤️
You want your helipad in the driveway circle.
Just make the front a huge burnout pad lmao
Have your buddy check on the auto ferry to haul that machine north. Saves stress saves the machine AND he'll get a great boat ride. Mer, try looking in New Mexico for an antique door. Santa fe or taos areas
The center of the driveway  has no drainage or electrical conduits. Why ?  you better get on that. Overlooked future issues lol
Finally a driveway made for package delivery 😂
When Matt was taken all the old stone off the house, there was a Mexican style art thing that he wanted to put back on. Did he ever do this? If I remember he did crack a few pieces of it though.
i am going to need to rewatch this series again when its finished so i can just enjoy the time-lapse of it being built and Matt and Mare moving in
nice transition, but no workspace next to the stove on either side and pullout drawers at counter level? you cant use the counter space..nice job though
are you going to just do a typical driveway or are you going to put some stamped concrete accents?
Man make sure that pad is falling away from that garage... the forms looked high to the garage doors .  Unless your putting drains in front of the doors and tying into what's there idk .
You should Make a go cart track in the oval in the driveway
the fact that i have been regularly looking forward to and watching the house updates for two years now…. crazy
I'm looking at the 7 ish foot concrete soccer wall. 100% someone is going to miss the wall and hit a window. I am calling it now
It's a wonder there isn't stories of that spooky house on the hill.
and you need a large flag pole in the circle with your state flag and American Flag.  with lights shining up to the flag.
The place is looking fantastic, you guys have done an incredible job.
Hey, the walls are actually white now!
I would widen the driveway and reduce the middle circle.
Hill Top Ranch!!!!
The inside of that fridge is just the sexiest thing...     Huge congratulations on everything - got the guts to dream bigger and follow through, great stuff... well deserved!
A small pond or fountain or some water feature out front of the big house on the hill might be cool maybe in the middle circle kinda hard to tell scale on camera but looks big enough
When all is said and done I know I’m not the o. One that wants to know what the cost was for cement for this house. Seems like you used insane amounts of cement 😂 it might make us all throw up a bit though haha 💰
You have the same fridge as me
Center oval looks like a great horse corral....
Good thing you will have the Cuda to replace the Bronco!
Matt dropping the beats on the video
A word to the wise, make the driveway circle wide enough that you can drift sideways all the way around it...
It's funny that Mere mentioned the depth of those parking spaces because my first thought when seeing the aerial drone shot of the driveway was "those parking spaces don't look big enough for a vehicle" lol
Outdoor motion lights are a must brother. Love the view.
It's a beautiful house but everything is light coloured.  No contrast at all. Could be so much nicer.
Wouldn’t you want to wait until last for the driveway? Seems like your going to need many loads of fill and topsoil I would be afraid of cracking the new driveway with all that heavy equipment moving around.
It's round enough and wide enough to drift around it. Just a thought.🤔
The center of the driveway would be great for kids to play baseball and football.
A fountain in the oval would be pretty cool. gotta do it before you pour tho
God Bless Matt, his family and friends.  Thank you for choosing better music!
Get a birch or oak tree. Nive trees that are strong and beautiful.
Try hippo hardware in portland Oregon for your door. They deal in antique building materials
Never Mind Matt I already told Mere. I tild you I will rat on you in a hot second because you didn't send me what I wanted :-D Your welcome Matt. :-)
Happy New Year guys.. New Year New Home.. Many good memories to be made there. Don't leave us out.
How do you manage that none of your followers go on your property. It's a huge problem here in Germany for the most big YouTubers.
Hope you test the driveway before they pour it
You need a fountain in the middle
How about a fountain in the egg center of the circle...
I hope Lincoln throws a banger party there in the future
Trailer ha Matt wonts a drift track and burnout area on his driveway
Also I think Matt's forgetting giving the bronco away he still needs to get the demo Cuda when it's done haha
i work in  the pool industry here in Florida and i  got say i don't think your pool builder are that good they are super slow and the way they have not fully cover the pluming with sand  and actually back-fill the pool but started to do the copping  some what crap given you are better of doing the back-fill after pluming and it inspection and electrical conduit  done  and its inspection if require done and bonding for the ground also .  having the area it self properly graded and compacted so you can do you r  deck and  then proceed to clean up the whole job site so you do your plaster with as minimal contamination.
You need to replace the bronco with a square body blazer
A pond in the center of the driveway would be sick. Thanks for the video.
You should build a deck off that steep drop by the pool
Rugs, rugs, rugs and don't forget nonslip edging because the kids and I'm including Matt, will try sliding on those floors.
Matt you have some large elevation changes to deal with
Have to ask since this is texas , how many undocumented/illegal workers did you use on you house construction??
ask Mere if she wants a mega vegetable or fruit garden lol... imagine having a low maintenance food forrest that doubles as shade and cover. then you could also have fresh produce whenever you want lol.
Didn't realize until this video how small the pool is. As it looked much bigger in your previous videos.
The house is coming together guys. Looks amazing can't wait to see the final product.
Why dont u use induction cooking?
Hey matt surely the circle in the driveway is for your helicopter 🚁 pad??
need a fire pond
Press it Linc..... too funny XD XD!
OMG! Adalyn is almost as tall as Mere! I'm pretty shocked right now, realizing that I've been watching this for so long.
Replace the old Bronco with the brand new Bronco.
Will be nice to see how the landscaping goes, what plants and trees you select etc.
Zip line?
Its a GIANT EGG!
Such a small ego——
“You’re ridiculous” Matt, mocking “you’re ridiculous”   Ends scene lmao
Matt, just an idea for the driveway. Could be a good idea to have french drains in addition to the normal ones just in case!
You should put a pond in the middle with a water fall.
But is the driveway wide enough to drift around?
Run conduit under the slab for wire.  Low voltage for landscape lighting or other.
👍👍🇺🇲
Bro... Don't forget to bring power and water to your little driveway island.
Love the house, can't wait for the completion.
This house is gonna be amazing!
Mere ❤️
man can not wait till it is finely  finished
instead of raising all the dirt to the porches put on a big deck right up to the wall then you can do a low slope deck ramp to the pool patio
Should put basketball court in the inner circle of the driveway.
Matt you need a fountain statue of yourself in the middle
no double stack oven?
Just bite the bullet and get a tank
Did you have enough room for your underground vault?
just out of curiosity, what is the sq ft of the house?
Got to love a big house on the hill update 👌🏻
You should definitely get some trees from Moon Valley Nursery from Glen Flora Farms in Texas best place to get trees with a huge variety from all over and great prices. Highly recommend!
Need dirt? Build another gun range just bring the dirt up to the house...
oh so y'all are RICH rich
When are we getting shirts with a "Look at that view"?
It's big enough for a helipad. It will make the commute to the bunker way way quicker.
Pollen is another word for tree semen
Ya know.... If the middle (the egg) of the  driveway was turf you wouldn't have to mow it AND it could double as parking for your hundred's of buddy's
Hey Matt great videos curious on the Bunker Safe. Could you give us a update on it. Thanks and keep up the great work
I was expecting a turret to be in the middle of the driveway, but grass is ok too i guess... sheesh.
Gonna need an updated intro since none of those vehicles are there anymore lol
Hey mat think about Irigation in the round about before you poor
Drift video around the driveway, just saying... 👀😁
bro Lincoln look just like you its just a little matt
Pot a small fish/koi pond in the front yard in  the circle driveway
i didnt see a driveway coming together. i saw a go cart oval forming.
What about conduit for power to the middle of the circle?  E.g lights, water fountain etc
gat another hum v
Straight pollen yo!
Ayoo Matt if you wanna replace the bronco I have an 02 RCLB lifted 4x4 Duramax you can buy dirt cheap in Michigan. Runs and drives.
Pot fillers seem like a great idea, but nobody has explained how you empty them. Just boil until the pot dries? 2 days later you take the empty pot of the stove?
Big flagpole in the center
Right On! Like the little round pool tiles, resembling air bubbles and the Cool kitchen tiles.
that place looks like a dream. congrats
An aquascape pound would be insane in that driveway
the kid in me can't help thinking this would be so awesome to play hide and seek here... also have paint ball battles in the woods below... "so many activities"-step brothers
you need a canon for the circle
Might as well be paving an interstate highway.  That is a lot.
Looking awesome. Not sure what the home owners insurance requirements are in texas but here any drop more than 30 inches has to have some kinda handrail. Just thinking about your retaining wall having a 7 ft drop. But you can put mulch or shrubs and thats kinda like a barrier to keep people away from the drop off.
You should totally get a blazer next and build the crap out of it!
This home is just amazing. Mere has impeccable taste ❤️ * chef kiss *  the butler's pantry and kitchen are dream worthy!! It's been so fun watching this series and the transformation of this house into a home 💞
Are you planting new trees or having trees transplanted?
Are those carrier infinity heat pumps or are they AC only?
@6:40 That look!!  :-D
Dream house right here! Love that you gave the bronco to Tyler’s brother too! Sounded like he got soooo many memories with it
Thank you for giving us an update on the house and also thank you for giving Tyler back the Bronco
Matt show us your underground bunker?👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👍
love these videos
Need enough room in the circle for one of the kids to reck a car
Happy wife happy life
you need a big aqua scape pond get greg
Put a huge mosaic fountain in the middle
get rid of the center grass area and go all concrete for a burn out pad on a hill woo woo
Waterline tile is rad
Awesome video
You see how the counter steps out a couple inches for the last cabinet next to the stove? Why don’t you just cut the counter back to be straight with the rest of the countertop? Seems like that might be easier and look nicer.
Keep in mind fifty-year-old Matt maybe doing the Landscaping
Matt, haven't seen your friend Matt Risinger on the show for some time now. When are you going to have him over?
I like that you left the outline of the top of the mountain
Can we please get update in your brothers family? I was a follower of his since way before he got sick.
you should start a gofundme for all the soccer balls/baseballs/frisbees/etc you're gonna lose over the cliff 😂
So next car will be Ford GT or Shelby Cobra?
You should plant trees the same age as your kids so every year they get older so do your trees. You can watch your trees grow as your kids do. You could do all the same type of trees. and get trees that mature overtime slowly
You’ll just have to get another Bronco and take another 10 years to build it. I’ll probably be 50 by the time it’s done and I’m 25ish years from then 😂
Your beard is getting gray, sir) At it looks dang good!
Matt forgot about the Demo ranch cuda one more car!!
I would put a Koi pond with a mini waterfall in the middle of the the driveway dressed up with some trees and other vegetation
Looking good! What kind of fence are you putting up around that 7' drop? It will be required for code.
It sure is nice seeing u shoot 100 yards now and then ty
That plastic covering the floor is going to cause it to Buckle.
Meres choice of tile is disgusting. Looks like an elders home in there
Motion sensor water dispenser on the inside of the fridge? I'd imagine that'd be annoying at times when trying to grab things in the back of the fridge🤣
I know a dude up north that would love to take a bite out of that driveway victory style!
Bushes and a birdbath fountain !!!
Omg I anodize parts for those kitchen appliances! Thats awesome. This whole build is very cool.
The circular driveway helps with larger vehicles.  I would have made sure it's big enough for a 45ft motor home or semi.  They need to get up the driveway and go back down without backing up.  It's so much easier to have things delivered.
Annie is awesome
from seeing the house in person before Matt owned it to now, wow what a transformation!
Not gonna lie I stopped watching the house build for a while now and to come back to it almost done is amazing to see, so satisfying I will definitely ty to keep up now
Why no cedar?
Hii, first of all, Happy new year!! Could you make a video with all de intros from the abandon (not abandon anymore) mansion? I think it would be pretty cool!😄😄😄
With the size of vehicles you buy, it needs to be wider by around six feet. Make the egg smaller lol.
2022 is currently taking a dump all over me so I'm hoping for a nice turnaround
That driveway is going to make it look so much more complete, I can't wait to see it
Pot filler and a butlers pantry, oooh yall fancy
Run conduit to the center circle of the driveway. Love how far the house has come
Love the fridge and freezer bought the same one last year. Only complaint is the freezer doesn't ever stop making ice like on its own and then when you pull the drawer open ice falls in behind the drawer x.x
That middle part could be a great garden spot. Just saying.
EGG shape in the middle ain't great more circler would look nicer 👌🤙💯 love everything else 👌💯
Love how with all your success you guys are so grounded and have hearts of gold are the real deal.You deserve it and more.Been watching for a couple years I just never open my mouth till I have something to say( know what I mean?) Love u guys!
Get the ac going for him before he drives it to Alaska
I think it makes the video when the kids act all goofy lol, well I guess they do take after their father eh Matt ;-)
Driveway looks a bit Narrow in places you want to make it wide enough to DRIFT around 😉😀🤙💯
That pollen cloud is unreal. WOW
Nobody thought you were selling the bronco, we all knew it was going to family
In my brain I’m thinking that that driveway is going to be jusssst wide enough to have a car sideways on it🤷‍♂️
You've got parking right in front of your open shower?
You and that pot filler lol. Every kitchen walk through you do you point it out. I find that so funny lol.
Will you have a veggie/herb garden? I feel you have the space. Maybe some fruit trees or avocado trees 😅. Those grow beautifully.
You could fit at least 3 bodies in that fridge
What drone do you use in the videos
hey matt what about the internet do you have good internet out there it is important as youtuber.otherwise you need to have elon musks starlink
@offTheRanch totally agree with Mer that the parking needs to go back further- you do need someplace to store your big trailer as well so might consider long enough to hold it and Earl or the 5 ton.
Put a pond or big fountain in the middle it will look nice
why don't you daily earl and let your company use the ford dual...
Why discourage a daughter from playing soccer ?
1:11 "Can I unbuckle?... How about now?... Now?... Now?... Now?"
Dope house !!
10000 friends😂😂 matt you mean 4.14million right…. Right
The circle bit in the driveway needs an aquascaped pond from TeamAquascape!
The success you've achieved is awe inspiring. Looks like you had a GD blast doing it too lol.
Anyone else notice the back porch drop is 2 Lincoln's tall
Dont forget to run some large pipes under the driveway to the centre sections for electrical cables and irrigation pipes aswell as a spare for future plans like a water feature.
Put a cart dirt track in the oval in front of the house
I think you should put a water fountain in the middle of circle driveway
Tell your countertop guys you need a stove rail. Put a wall ledger on the wall and seam the rail from top to top. Very common issue.
Ii like watching Matt's renovation updates because it makes my renovations seem like they are going really fast. :-)
The not abandoned, not small house on a hill, saga continues!
You two have done an amazing job bringing life back to the entire property! With all of the unobstructed sunlight hitting the rooves, solar panels for electricity will be able to make enough power to run the entire house/HVAC/pool pumps and have plenty for battery storage/charging.   Are the rooves and drains in the front of the house going to drain into a cistern for irrigation?  It's going to take a lot of water to grow grass and anything else up there.
That is one awesome,  let’s call it what it is it’s a mansion on top of a huge hill / small mountain!!!
Isn't a cool guy like you offer valey service to his 10k cool friends when they come to party?
I just want that kitchen... lol I can't be the only one?
You should put a fountain in the middle of the circle
This is awesome!!! Nice house, awesome family
I would not skate your pool.
Dude you should get a huge water feature in the driveway!! some youtube colab or something
Lincoln mullet looks awesome! You are really the perfect family, everything looks perfect ;)
what about you put a pond in the circle
you're driveway cost more than my house budget
>>>>>  POWER OUTLET  <<<<<<   TO CENTRE ISLAND   OUT FRONT   ,,,,,,  A must have ,,,
The bronco will be fine. I drove my 1988 from Arizona to Alaska last April. The only issue I had was fuel economy!  Lol
Go kart driveway all day long.
Watching these over the last 20 years, I feel I was helping.  I guess less the sunburn.
I do landscaping here in Minnesota, but I am glad that I am not doing that yard, it would take a lot of work
Mat the circle in the middle of the driveway put a big ass flagpole there that would be awesome!!!!💪🇺🇸
Why no cedars?
Fourth of July is going to be a family gathering at your house for now on.  The views are terrific.
That back splashes is so ugly.
I need to know what brand of fridge that is!
Dude...it took you like 3min to walk half way around your driveway...  I can be from one end of mine to the other in like 20 seconds.  LOL!!!!!!!!
You need some Texas bluebonnets in that circle
You should run power to that center area. Guarantee it will come in handy. Xmas lights, dolphin enclosure, etc.
Damn I would love to be the contractor on that job.
Looking amazing 😀👍❤️
Why don't you put Solar panels on the roof you have the space for it
Matt you should consider extending the parking next to the garage as well. It would be nice to be able to park bigger vehicles there and the garage would shield them from view rather than having them stick out too much. Could be a nice place to park the 5 ton.
By the time the landscaping is done and the grass has grown, all your kids will have grown out of throwing a football or playing soccer. By the time the trees have grown in the middle of the driveway,  your kids will have left home.
The island really does look like an egg in the driveway
It’s a retaining Wallllllllllllllllllll
should do a small parking lot for valet
Matt. Y'all gonna have the dopest YT'ber crib ever. What makes it... that it's a family home. That it's in Texas, and it's on a hill, like a castle or some s#!÷. It's fantastic,  you do it it well homie.  Also!!!! Major f-<×!~& ups for giving that Bronco back to its family. So many UToobers give away s-!÷ for views. You gave back, to a friend, and family that you grew up with. The fact that they are,were, service members is a second thought. Its that it was a childhood friend, that means more. I say this as a 10 year Army vet. So many people give stuff away to veterans, not because they know them, just, well, just because.  You gave the brother, of a man that gave his life in the service of this wonderful country, his truck back. AND HIS BROTHER SERVES THE COUNTRY TOO!!!!! Honestly, Matt thank you so much for that. Its a blessed, and beautiful thing. God bless you, and Texas.  Gig'em, hurts to say, bit I will.
Back yard looks like a great place to shwack some golf balls off the mountain!
Let's go!!! I've been waiting a minute for this.
I mean, you gotta go all out for the tube and put a fountain in the middle of your circle driveway
you need a shirt saying "What a view'
The circumference of the circle should include ROSES!
I really like the shorter update video
You have got to build an Aquascape Pond in the center circle!
It looks so different! It looks nice!
Kidos being goofy and playing at the end ..❤.. great family
You're a good man Matt. Tell forest to start a YouTube channel so we can see his journey to alaska!
Some palm trees and a big fountain and water feature in the circle.  It'll look just like a drug lord's compound😁
Big flagpoles in the middle!
Bad ass driveway
Jesus. What's this dude do for a living? Just subbed to demo ranch recently
I would make the ring in the middle just a little smaller, and run some pipes for water, and power to it. Then you can make a fountain there or if you have a tree can run lights to it all easy. :)
Don't you want to connect your driveway to your front porch Is that way you have a clean walkway
When he said "dad joke "  I instantly thought of the "Will a boyfriend stop a 50cal" meme
you should make a koi pond in the middle of that circle with trees/flowers and what not
Nothing says "hold my beer" like an oval track in your front yard !  Way to go matt !  Lol. I love it
I am lucky to benefit from a massive fridge but there is a downside I will not work in the summer or any day it is actually warm outside on warm days I have to store stuff inside.
Where's the burnout pad??
How about one of those revolving car platforms like car dealers have out in the middle to showcase the latest greatest project? Or an expresso stand and tram rides for sightseers like Universal Studios?
Beautiful Home!🇺🇸🇺🇸🤘🏼
What's the name of the Fridge ? I'd like to get one for my house please and Tha k you.
For your future sanity, and cost effectiveness, run water and electrical to the grassy part in the middle of the driveway before you lay the concrete.
1. You gave your son a mullet? Dude...yuck 2. I don't understand why people want to have a fridge that matches the cabinets? First of all, they're all white, so smudges and grime are guaranteed to show up easily. Secondly, you can't even FIND the fridge! Because it looks like everything else! Ridiculous.
You need some solarpanels :D
For the algorithm
What A BOSSSSS
Matt is that area prone to fires?
Who thinks the demolitia logo should be in the middle of the driveway in landscape how epic would it look from the drone shots
Luckily the winter pollen has cleared, I think you deserve a Kindig-it  design car to replace the Bronco.
Make your kids strong playing soccer ball.  Make them use a medicine ball instead to kick, they will not know the difference.  Just an idea.
Should have made the island round then have the landscapers turn it into a giant reticle.
Big house needs a nice fountain within that circle the driveway stretchs around
LOL that look Linc gave you when you tried to claim innocence with the fridge... He definitely learned that from Mere, because she gave you the same one.
needs a water fountain in the middle like at Vegas with water jets of colored water lol and a big sign in neon dancing show girls optional
will pool tile stop a bullet
That's a big pour. I've been watching " cement with the hausers" so now I'm an expert. 😁
Call the property Demonation.
bmg vs  blue floor covering
I think I missed something along the way.  What's the little building and small silo looking thing right next to the driveway circle?
You need a magnificent fountain in the middle for that magnificent driveway
The kidos have really grown during this series.
Hey Matt, don't forget about Christmas light electrical outlets in the yard and center circle area of the driveway.  I regretted not doing that every year.
I think the egg shaped circle out front need a like 100 ft pole with a 15ft by 25ft America flag.
the oval needs 3 flag poles for  USA flag , Texas Flag and Demo Flag and/or Demo ranch statue ! :-)
So probably a dumb question but I assume that the range is part of this property I clouldent find any clarification in the old videos
I'm not a fan of seeing things I'll never have myself, I'm only watching the video because I'm a fan of Matt and his channel
**DOGWOODS, MAGNOLIAS & CREPE MYRTLES = AWESOME TREES & BLOOMING GORGEOUS!!!**
We need a Lincoln range day video
their literal Ivory Tower
Not sure our neighbors to the north are letting non citizen non business travelers through yet.
YOU GUYS NEED A BEAUTIFUL POND IN THE CIRCLE !  😍🔥 Done by GregWittstock the pond guy
Can’t wait to see the finished house.
WATER FOUNTAIN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CIRCLE
When the kids get older, they are going to be able to throw epic parties while Matt and mere are on vacation!
Day 220 of asking for a vid: How bulletproof are bullets?
Gotta get a full basketball court in this place matt
I thought that was the smoke from Colorado
Well I'll be dipped as vise grip garage would say you have a giant egg in your front yard
Are you keeping the chickens? It’s looking really cool
is that house on the hill not finished yet lol come on get a move on lol
In the center
You guys should put a waterfall feature in the middle of your driveway
Idea for the egg shape in the driveway. Large fountain with guns spraying the water out, and flowers or shrubs in the shape of the demo eagle
A huge congratulations on all your success guys! You have definitely earned it. What a project to take on and make your own.
Hey Matt, were is the barracuda
Im glad this house didnt drag on like Pure living for life grifters. still not sided lol 2+ years later.
What about a water Fountain in the middle
"The Happing"
Wow The House Looks Sweet.............you guys have come a long way on that house
Also we all know once the driveway is poured Matt is probably going to do a burnout on it right?   Its like his tradition for new concrete. lol
Really hope you put a huge flagpole with a massive American Flag in the center of the circle driveway
You should put a big Demo Ranch Fountain in the middle of the driveway
Even a P 1000 love you
Matt... Grass? on top of a hill.. in Texas.  Xeriscaping.  Check into it.
The big circle in the front should be grass and a place to play sports in since it's flat and the balls won't fall down the mountain as easily
Matt your a great guy. All my best for you and your family in 2022 from Austin.😁😁😁👍👍👍👍
Can’t wait to see it all done, good work
Matt matt make a concrete form 2x4 ft extra off the side and you can all put your hand prints in it and then you can save it for later and watch the kids hands grow. Make it separate so you can move it around.
You should put a slab of concrete in the center of the driveway for burnouts.
Oh thank God..... I haven't been able to sleep at night worrying about what kind of driveway you were going to have and whether you were going with perennials or annuals off your veranda...
Should definitely do a fountain in the middle of that driveway tho 👀👀👀👀👀
Think he is over 1 million yet??
I would put in middle helipad.
Make sure to put ramps for wheelchair access 💪🏽 much easier than stairs anyways
YES MATT WE KNOW ITS TILE AND NOT PEASANT WALLPAPER YA OVER ACHIEVER!😆😉
I love that Mere is legit tapped into the project as much if not more than the general contractor.
Doesn't pollen burn well? So just bring your flamethrower everywhere you go.  Btw, you should buy a bigger flamethrower.
Why is your driveway island egg shaped instead of oval?
Make sure you put pipes into the center of the driveway for alights and irrigation
That instrumental showing the driveway and landscaping is DOPE!!!!
Now that you have the parking, you can go look for friends.
I think you guys should grow stuff in the middle of the driveway.   Or the Chickens
Stub a couple pipes up in the areas you want irrigation/landscape lighting before you pour the concrete..
Come on Matt let's be honest... it is a mansion
Lmao I wish good luck to the person who has to grout the tile that we seen at 7:44.  I hate Grouting tile 😅
Man your brother must so proud!!
Needs a Big water feature in the centre of the driveway
That is a beautiful home. You did good!
Aqua scape water feauture in the middle of the driveway??
Mayor's right the driveway is shit.  It should be wider.
You should put up a flagpole in the center
Matt, congrats to you on your success and your family’s home. You’re an awesome person.  I also like how you matched the house’s paint to your beard hair.
ridonkulous
This house is totally something you would build in Minecraft.
Matt you should have made the middle a burnout pad
Burnout pad in the middle LOL
Should just take out the center egg and concrete it all…… not for a burnout pad or anything…..
Lots more room for drifting and burnouts without that landscaped island in the driveway.
Matt you ROCK.  You truly are a great friend repairing the Bronco and giving it to his brother. The ride to Alaska is going to be AMAZING. The new place looks absolutely gorgeous. Congratulations
#offtheranch yup blue star
Mount a HD camera to the Bronco and ask him to record the trip to Alaska.    Especially in the mountains!
Such a nice front yard to build the chicken mansion on the hill
#offtheranch blue star range ?
Yessssssssss
#offtheranch the black out edition. Just like your 30/6
#offtheranch so you got some jenn air columns !! Nice
I wanna see the bunker you installed. Is it still working good?
How many vehicles do you think Mere has been bare ass in?
How about this, restore an old chopper and make a landing pad
Congratulations, I believe you definitely deserve this.   You all work so hard
Just wait until the cars of your friends leak oil on your brand new concrete.  Mere is going to freak.
6:25 press it
You know this is everyone’s favorite channel on YouTube if you can get 15k in 2 hours lol..
Oh no mere. You had every chance to stop Lincoln from pushing that button lol.
Matt, you're gonna want to run electricity and water to the center of your driveway for low voltage lighting and/or a fountain.
House exterior needs color.
Maybe I missed something, but Matt was talking about "track hoes" and "flat fun areas..." I think I might have once dated someone like that...
getting dizzy, with camera bouncing
You should get @victory outdoor services to do your driveway !!!
Go to Round Top for doors.
Those kids walking so close to the edge without hard rails makes my heart beat faster dude.
Happy New Year beautiful family. The house is really coming along beautifully.  I love that fun tile in the kitchen & the circle tile for the water line in the pool.
Matt soon to have he's own burnout circle pad in front of the house...
I’m honestly excited to see the landscaping being done the computer renderings you printed out was cool on paper !🤔👍
Mere look up country cowboy in Albuquerque. If the at still 8n business they have old doors from spanish missions tha were remodeled. They are epic.
Massimo should send you a buck 250x utv!
Have you put in irrigation system or a empty pipe to the centre of the driveway?
That is definitely the House on the Hill.
It would be cool if forest recorded some of his trip driving the bronco to Alaska
You have the opportunity to make a giant eyeball for your front yard.
Good bless you 😅
sooooo .... the bronko is gone .... soooo theres space for a new big vehicle ..... tank when ? ;) #don't tell mere
Looking good
😂💯🙌🏽💯
You could hire me full time to kill wasps?? I’m sure there is a solution for that with all the houses around here with exposed rafters, but just in case, I’m your guy.
That roof looks like it needs some solar panels
The irrigation workers are in for a hell of a job 😂 to rocky, leaks all over the place.
They make lights that can be sank into the driveway, along the edges. A couple neighbors did it in their new drives and it rich.
Matt why do your 10,000 friends need to park you could fly them in with your airplane
Yooo that center space of the driveway in the middle needs an aqauscape feature ... You should hook up with Greg the pond guy !!!
8:22 The tile, to replace the pool tile that wouldn't work in Texas, come in a box with a KEEP DRY warning on it.
Haha liked the video one I seen the girl messing around after outro lol the family side of this channel's so wholesome.
Should do some stamping around the driveway makes it look fancy and curb appeal
Pool is gonna be a pain in the ass to clean, did our pool in similar tiles, never listening my wife again...
You should hit golf balls from up there
How about a bunker update?
If that’s all pollen I am staying away from there, I would not be able to see or breathe.
The big circle needs a pond or waterfall
I so can't wait for this house to be done so I can unsubscribe!
Are you going to paint lines like it's a parking lot?? lmao
I can’t believe Matt said “buried some pipe” and didn’t look at the camera and giggle… smh
🤪 Gee Wizz!
Just why?😂
Matt you should have a Irrigation system installed so your lawn looks awesome all the time
Lincoln looks like he's in the band Oasis...
Glad you noticed the parking error, but seriously the egg is too big for Earl and your trailer with cars parked around it as well. Think about 2foot off the egg all the way around. Happy New Year to you all Matt
That's  a big house! Is there a Bat cave?😛😜
Great house. Guess you had to just forget about all the animals to get ALL the STUFF you WANT, huh ? 😕
Demolition ranch logo in turf in the center of the circle
I love the up date but what's new with the underground pewpew safe
A nice fountain would look amazing in that island for the driveway.
For as long as this is taking you could have had a new house built!
YES!
Be sure to bring in a lot of compost, and break up that hardpan so you can actually grow a landscape... should be able to get 25 ton truckloads at around 25 dollars a ton. Also keep in mind not all compost are equal, the more varieties of inputs the better so try to get good quality and not just composted woodchips.
I think that it would be real fun if you invited Abel sometimes. Not the 5ton the 5ton man 👨
Dude, You built an oval track in your front yard.  AWESOME 👌😎👍
parking spots on each side of the egg.
Gotdamn....  You have built a McMansion!!!  But that is a beautiful home.  Congrats to you and your family!  Its been great ride with you guys with building this!!!
Did he ever fix the pipe mere put a a nail through
I should watch this channel more
Put a pond in the middle of the  Circle
YOU DA MAN MATT!! I do wonder who's PAYING for ALL THIS CONSTRUCTION!!! ..LMAO!
Matt! Do yourself a favor and put sleeves in the ground from the house to the landscape island in the driveway for electrical landscaping lighting or maybe irrigation. Put a bunch pipe is way cheaper than cutting fresh concrete to do it after the fact.
There is a place in Santa Fe that specializes in antique doors.
There's a little bonus footage at the end just so yall know
Being a concrete mixer driver myself as soon as I saw those driveway forms I was like woooo thassa lotta concrete 😂😂
Super pumped for y’all! Mere, you’re a trooper dealing with Matt’s ish for so long! Can’t wait to see the finished product
Alaska was warm yesterday Anchorage was 67 degrees.
Make sure to throw some conduit for electrical to that center island in the driveway you’ll regret forgetting that later on! Coming out sick!!! 🔥
Bruh is it not cold rn in texas it's 18°rn in oklahoma
Should put a big apple tree in the middle area and have a little wooden swing hang from it.
Was expecting a fountain in the driveway oval
I don't know if this has been answered. But anyone know how many acres the "Abandoned Mansion" property is?
Is anyone else afraid for Annie's future boyfriend?  Not just because of Matt the gun toting dad but because of Insannie?
Hell ya Matt
100,000 views in 60 minutes. 🤯 whoa.
Anyone know the brand on the refrigerator and range?
Good Stuff
What's the class tune playing over the drone shots at start? The link for music doesn't link the same correct song?
Please have Mere show us the lil things on the house
you better give credit to vicscrappyvideos
If you plan ahead and grade the driveway to funnel water to the center to water charge any trees and plants and tier the center to recharge terrace style and set it up so over flow goes to the low end last and thru a culvert you will get the benefit of all that driveway surface area and your trees and plants will grow ten times as fast and lush. Use native plants or xerophytic (dry climate loving). Plus the overflow that goes thru the culvert can be funneled to plants outside the driveway.  And , if you harvest the water from your roof with gutters and cisterns you will have free water for your plantings around the house. An Oasis on a hilltop.
One way I’ve filled in the space behind a stove is to make a small shelf on the wall, and mount a scrap of the stone from the countertop on to it. However, it can be hard to find a strip that has the factory rounded edge, and fits in with the grain and coloration of the same oval on either side.
The house on Mount Carriker
if its not to late a pocket door would be a good choice for the pantry it seem to be a choke point so with a swing door it will just get worse.
I would love to see a fountain in the middle island of the driveway.
Please don't put pavement in this. It always deteorates and looks horrible. Please do Belgrade pavers. I would do this job for you if you would do it right. But asphalt looks horrible. Cement is better but pavers are the most elegant
Omg that kitchen is amazing! Great job mere for the decor!
THAT'S PRETTY NEAT! haha
hey matt just seen your newest video and i think you should get a jeep wrangler rubicon
I thank you need to put a statue of matt holding two 50 cal in the middle of the driveway it would be dope
The Rodney Neature reference, I DIED!!!
Matt, get a hair cut, pls.
You should have Team Aquascape put in a waterfall/Koi Pond in the egg of the driveway
Are you still a vet? Or did you dump animals for u tube?
Hey Matt, you should work with Greg Witstock, the Pond Guy (https://www.youtube.com/c/GregWittstockThePondGuy/videos) and build a sick entrance with waterfalls and stuff
don't crowd the entryway with alot of trees though! keep them low bushes.. why would you want to cover up the house? the only thing I want to know.. is how much that driveway would cost.. lol
THANK GOD you didnt grab a sub. the jennair is SO much nicer.
I'd love to see Matt and Mere do a "Reaction" video to the first episode in this series.  I just rewatched part of it.  Mere saying "This was YOUR purchase.  Let's be clear about that!" is just one of the gems from that video.
Awsome and happy 2022.
Get a Murphy Door for pantry and have a hidden door
You should have Tigran Gertz come in and do a colab and do your landscape and stuff for you!
My husband made a fix for our fridge door which will hit the corner of the dishwasher if both are open.  He glued on a piece of felt....  ;-)
Been following this since the beginning. Love this house and what you guys have done with it!
Your house is gonna have more parking then my school
can't wait its gonna look insane Matt
What happened to the bunker at the house
He needs a statue of himself riding a shark with a AR's in both hands and water shooting out of the shark's mouth and the tips of the ARs in that open space in the center of the driveway
Thank you for doing a turnaround in your driveway. Delivery drivers will love you for that.
That driveway looks mighty driftable 😈 🏎💨
Black pool tile?  Can't wait to see it done.
For the circle in the middle you should put grass and a water fountain in the middle also some flowers
Get a r.o filter for that fridge.... tap water be nasty yo
Put some powerlines in to the parking to load electrical vehicles (brrrr)
those kids don’t know how frickin lucky they are.
Green grass and trees on top of a hill made of rock.... good luck with that.
Can't believe it took you this long to learn that there are boy trees and girl trees.  And yes, that means that pollen is tree sperm. And you're breathing it.  Anyhoo, definitely get Mere's approval on the driveway NOW before it's too late. Also, that whole "falling off a cliff" thing sounds way too real so make sure there's something fairly soft growing out past the play area. If your kids are anything like I was as a kid, one or more IS gonna fall off the edge sooner or later.
Need to talk Forrest into vlogging adventures in the bronco in Alaska, that would be some good content
I drove from Atlanta to Anchorage one time. That was like 4200 miles. Now I am a retired OTR truck driver and I do NOT miss it a bit.  If I were Mere, taking care of 4 kids would wear me out.
I audibly screamed “F yeah!” When I saw that this video posted.
Mrs.OfftheRanch: Don't feel too unlucky with all of Matt's vehicles junking your place up. My EX had to deal with three 5-tons, three M1009's(Chevy Blazers), an M1008, two tractors(one broken), six 18 wheeler trailers, countless small trailers for equipment, etc.. That said, she doesn't have to deal with any of it anymore though. She flew the coup. She was not near as strong willed, resilient and understanding as you. 🤗 Y'all take it easy,
He's putting an oval race track in the front yard hell yeah brother
It's 6 degrees and blowing about 50-60mph right now. Stay home, Forest. You don't want to be here. Lol.
Super sick and been waiting for this video for days Thank you sir Thank you.  Edit: Just finished video am not waiting for next video. Please advise.
Youtuber building a house not buying a readymade house thats educational..nice one matt
I love how the intro has cars and buildings you no longer have.   Time for an update
in the middle of the driveway put a fountain with 2 AR's and have the water shoot out the end of the gun
Always major life motivational to me.... Salute to everyone grind, Motivations, accomplishments , families , goals.....
Matt, put a demolition symbol fountain in the middle of the driveway or a pew! Would be epic
Get Cletus to hook you up with The Lawn Care Nut on the grass.
Seeing link in a new house makes him look so much digging then from when seeing him in the old house
Should definitely shrink the oval in the middle and make it a huge motor Court. Also I can tell you hate the tile back splash! Lol I do and can tell mere didn't like it either
Hey Matt I think you should put a really big net by the sport erea just in case a soccer ball goes down the hill or the football goes to high and cant be caught
Ford GT delivery when?
That’s gonna be a great burnout pad (;
If you’re gonna want some trees and grass surrounding the driveway , you’re gonna have to dig down and loosen up the soil and mix in some organic solids.  All that machinery is gonna have compacted the living daylights out of that soil…that’s gonna kill off any goodness within it real quick.  I’d mix in some agricultural gypsum to the soil too as this will help keep it nice and moist and loose pack also.
" press it, Linc " lmaooo
I really like this mansion. Great conception, beautiful vue . I would make a guest House, definitely
Definitely some fruit trees to bring in the wildlife. I hear dogs love to play fetch with grapefruit (Coop’s dogs said so).
You never showed us you cleaning out the old barn :( that would've been entertaining to see lol
Matt the middle part of the driveway is just begging for a big fountain!!
Can we call it the Egg House? because the fenced off middle part of the entrance looks like a giant egg
7:31 I`m sorry, but, eeewwwww!
❤🧡💛💚💙💜🖤
We need to see the underground bunker at the house
Matt is living the dream
Area out front would be ideal to have a great big American Flag. Lighted at night, on top of a hill…
88k views in a hour…….damn
You have a lot of stuff, but I see your family is your greatest gift. This will be a beautiful forever home for you guy’s. Has your Dad been keeping an eye on the progress?
Getting so close! Please be triple certain you have all of your electric and water infrastructure run before you pour. Even if your not sure please make it available, you do not want to spend mega thousands in five years to dig and trench to keep your landscape beautiful. Landscape infrastructure is a thing... We made that mistake on our build.
I love that the fridge doors look the same as the cabinets, that is so freaking cool.
Does anyone know what brand of range that is?
Cant wait to see you guys move in. And for it all to be done
Probably too late now. But if you lock in landscaping inside that loop and you'll never get any future spread axle 53ft flatbed deliveries again.  Or you gotta talk em into backing up the whole driveway.
Dude...  fruit trees, you definitely need some fruit trees there...
A giant flagpole with an American flag and a Demo Ranch flag would look cool in the middle of the driveway. 🇺🇸🤘🏼
Flat lander moves to hill then makes it flat ;) jk
Ok, you have a oval driveway, back to it being a mansion, or at least a compound.
Run some PVC pipes under the driveway to get water and electricty to the center of the driveway.
Should put a water fountain or koi pond in big circle in front of house. Or both
The center of the driveway looks eggcellent.
Actually Alaska is experiencing a very warm winter this year...... so far
how about   a fountain in the middle  of the driveway  with the demoranch emblem
Just how much that driveway is going to cost is probably more then my house..lol
Man y'all are bout to be living in the big leagues with this house it's super nice. Mansion life
dang he is very rich
When we getting a new barn tour do you have it defined on a comp of what it will be
Big flag pole in the oval !!!
Matt! Pro tip from a subsurface investigator. Anything you burry that you don't want hit place a tracer wire. You will thank yourself later if you ever have to dig up a pipe or dig for any other reason. Any basic utility locator will be able to find it. Otherwise you would need a expericned GPR operator to identify them.
Look at maybe a French drain so it doesn't stand out as a drain
Love y’all’s attitudes and all the work you’ve put into your new home! Happy New year guys! Keep the videos coming ! We are loving them From Lafayette ,Ga
Just the form for the driveway makes the house look so different.
Make it a sunken feature so you don’t block that view. Do not just have grass there. I will never visit if you do.
Get an aquascape for that circular area out front
Y'all need some ginormous fans on top of the roof blowing in every direction to keep that Cedar Fever AWAY!!! I mean, you're in THE perfect spot for it! Why not!
Loving these strings of OTR episodes. It’s like the 12 days of Christmas but BTS off the ranch style lol.
Must be nice.  100k dollar driveway
cant w8 to see the opening party
Plant lots of native trees and let the rest go wild
It'd be nice if that house had a view...
Go cart track whaaaaaaaaaat
“Press it Linc!”😂😂
Matt if you're allergic plant only female trees :p
I always wanted to put an entire army of Gnomes all lined up in ranks in front of the house.  My wife won't let me.
Beautiful  , can't wait till the property is done ......
Put a water feature in that circle before you do the driveway or at least plumb for it.
I want to flat track my Sportster around your driveway. Hahahaha
Thank you for sharing!
I've been watching since you stalked the property. I can't believe it's almost done. I cant wait to see the finish product and you all living in it. You better keep vlogging for us. 😁
Contact t Chip and Joanna Gaines for antique doors. Midland Texas.
You should go to Alaska with him!!!!!
Addie’s voice is changing so much!!!😱I remember when she was tiny
A Japanese Maple tree would look nice in the front
I would put headliner and stuff on it for him
Imagine an F5 Shelby Cobra or a RCR Ford GT parked in front of his house
Just a beautiful house update and happy new year
Matt, in that center grass area of your driveway, you NEED to put a statue of you riding the shark from the old Bunker Branding mural!
Awesome to give the Bronco!  Hate to be Mr. Negative tho, but omg! Way too much 70's and 80's white walls and cabinets! Like 🤢🤢🤮  looks horrible
I think you need a pond with a fountain in the middle of the circle for the driveway, that would be awesome.
What about pipes under the driveway over to the island in the middle for potential power needs such as lights and or pipes for future water/sprinkler pipes etc.  Its better to have them buried JUST IN CASE.
You should do a bonzie tree in the circle
Matt, I wish you could attend the church I go too, I go to The Door Christian Fellowship in San Antonio ! At least visit once! You would love it! It’s on the corner of marbach and 410 in the west side! I am Augy!
Vinca minor ,Sedum and creeping thyme might work for lawn and low water use
You've come a long way on this project can't wait to see the finish products
I remember when they were tearing rotted wood out and now they’re almost moved in 👍🏽
We had a similar issue with our 48 in stove and cabinet. What we ended up doing was filling the back space of the stove with a matching granite. It not only looked aesthetically pleasing but has also helped the backsplash not getting stained or dirty. Remember these 48 in stoves produce a lot of BTU and having that gap in the back really helps to circulate the heat out of the exhaust vent on the stove to your custom hood vent as well.
It needs a volleyball pit for the yard games
🥚how life starts
Im super excited to see the landscaping around the driveway aand front yard
Seems matt and forrest can relate on many levels,  giving Forrest the Bronco really did something to my feelings. We all miss Mark and wish we got a chance to meet Tyler on the channel. I bet Mark put a 350 big block on Jesus's lawnmower with some swampers and him and Tyler are up there ripping it!
Have a wonderful New  Year.
Plant berry bushes for the kiddos, Low maintenance  fresh fruit
What about the underground bunker
Those built-in refrigerators are great until they need to be replaced. At that time they will no longer make one with the same dimensions.
You're pollen 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Still sad the hump in the middle is gone. That was such a nice feature for the kids to play on. Also not a big fan of fully concrete/asphalt driveways, would go with some nice water permeable pavement.
It sure don't like it did when you started. Looks nice. Nicer.
“He wants to take it in the summer because Alaska is alaska right now” hate to tell ya Matt, but in the summer Alaska is still going to be known as Alaska lol
YouTube has changed your life, God bless you and yours.
I saw something in your video that brought me to tears. I don't want you to suffer the same as my wife and I and my friends did. I saw that Mere was holding your daughter while you were driving. I have some friends that did the same thing .But while they were doing it they had a bad accident. Not their fault .But the car flipped and the child flew out of the car . It died. As a father that has lost a child as well its hard to see. And because I don't want this to happen to you.  I lost my wife because our child was hit by a pickup. When a family loses a loved one it has consequences for the immediate family more than you might think.  Sorry If you don't like my posting .But really you have such a wonderful family .
truck delivey is not going to be easy when cars blocking the way. semi truck, not going to happen. what about the roof and ground water handeling? try get limo there.
I would plum your sprinkler system for the egg in the middle before you pour the concrete.
For sure a house that houses a wealthy family! Congratulations to yas for your success!
Hell yeah man! Let's go! You're the best! Keep up the great work!
You don’t know how much I needed this
LMAO!!  "Press it, Link."  Huge Dad fist bump!  :D
I recommend Pecan trees. By the time you're 50ish, the trees will be producing pounds of free food that costs a pretty penny to buy in stores. You can also gift them to your friends and family.
Put in sleeves to the island and front house beds for irrigation and electrical before you pour!
I literally wanna come to your new house just to tee up abt 1000 golf balls and launch em off that hill 😂😂😭 should’ve opened a driving range
They should put a little fish pond in the center with a water fall
That's going to be so nice when it's all done!
That’s about to be a million dollars in concert
I would just fill in the circle to be honest with you 💁‍♂️
I need a house like that so bad.
Are you all bringing the chickens too?
Should have had a Massive center piece fountain in the giant egg shape plot
That fridge probably costs more than my car lmfao
I think Matt need the help of Greg Wittstock aka The Pond Guy, to fulfill his landscaping on a mountain challenge.
Your center planter looks like a egg 😂
Hey Dr. Matt.....what about safety features throughout the house.  If you or family gets hurt or visitors are disabled  using crutches or wheelchairs?  How would they get to 2nd floor?  Elevator?
The return of *that's pretty neat* is what I've been waiting for
look into japanese maple trees and the weeping larch tress
Leviton makes great WI-FI light switches.  They're easy to install and configure. I have them installed in my mini mansion. They make it easier to manage the lights with the kids.
If you don't put a FLAGPLOE in the middle of that, you FAIL as king!
Wow, she's moved way beyond "resting bitch face" to full-on "continuous bitch personality."  There is exactly zero joy inside this women. Nothing erodes the soul like pessimism and his patience will eventually break....completely.  Divorce in 5 years will not be pretty, or cheap.
I can’t wait to see it done I’m happy for you and your family don’t forget outdoor barbecue pit that’s a must
No, I did not think you were going to sell the bronco. Yes you buy all kinds of vehicles for a couple of minutes and then somehow they end up on vice grip garage. But not this one. I figured it was going to go to somebody special, or you found a homeless person, gave him a job at the bunker, and then gave him the bronco or some sort of common ridiculous scenario that you find yourself in. We have faith in you.
long time fan here! I just wanted to say its great watching you all! I find my self more and more unsubscribing from people i have watch for so long cause slowly you get to know them and see the real them and i find i dont agree with the views of most or how they truly treat people, but when i watch you i see more and more of a big heart and a great passion towards people. seems nowadays we fade in the background into someone else's dreams taken advantage of because are heart's are so big... Congrats and Thank You for being a great person !
Demolitia, take the literal 2 seconds to report spam comments. Let's not allow these spammers to ruin YouTube like they have on every other platform!
That tile in the pantry will mess with your eyes
Matt needs a waterfall in the circle of the driveway.
Maybe the driveway path right n front of the main entry doors could be widened. So that other cars can safely pass any parked car that would be sitting idle in front of the main entry doors. Think future family dinners when all the kids grow up to bring their own children. This house most likely will accommodate those big family dinners and barbeques. Also, another cool thing to consider is adding a fixed roof/awning over that area in front of the main entry walkway to the front doors would provide shelter from weather.
That *is a mansion
Of course... Texas is hot, no wonder why no dark color on house,
You need a pond
What part of Texas is this
Cleet will definitely drift your driveway. Mare will be so happy.
At the front door you should put a carport/covering
❤️❤️
You guys should really consider getting an aqua scape pond in the middle of the driveway or a water festure
6:33 this just shows how cool of a dad matt is.
Make that center parking spots or a tennis/basketball court :)
Hey this is a first I finally caught a vid before it being uploaded for an hour
on the egg shape in front of the garage you could have a cut out with drain for car wash
Looking awesome big difference huh
Wheres the water feature and pond going
if you dont put a fountain in the middle of the island you might as well just sell that place and move into a motel 6
Mate, thanks for all these videos! Loving them!!
Matt should do a anti-pollen t-shirt
happy new year
Get a k5 blazer
Enough room for the parents to move in and be with the grand kids.
Is Matt still a practicing veterinarian?
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸👀👀👀☕️☕️☕️👋👋👋🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Matt you got me excited for a second, I thought you were building a horse corral
Looking really good...love the tiles in the little pantry...
Ha 10,000 friends u mean 4 million friends come over:)  thanks for the invite.
Don't forget your water lines in electrical out to the island in the driveway
I stopped watching video 2 minutes in
Your videos get me through the day. My mom will be in the hospital for the next few days at least. She has COVID and pneumonia.
Wtf I sneezed and he said bless you
I think the driveway circle needs to be wider so you can better drift around it
You should burry a pipe to your center circle in case you want some power there later. Just a thought.
Am I the only one who noticed the bird that vanished in mid air at the 10:35ish mark
Make sure you have enough driveway to back into each of your garage bays--with even your largest (or longest) of vehicles.
My bro #1 has 4500 ft house. Bro #2 has 7000 ft house. I’m not jealous.
I love how I wasted my time watching this video thinking that they would actually show us the landscaping
Matt said he getting that green stuff... “grass” yeah okay Matt we all know your little secret I won’t say anything.
Is this a new thing all the YouTube's are making short videos Just like the inflation in this country I think everybody's joining the bandwagon and charging people whatever they can get
The nature walk clip had me dying
lmao the neat que had me dying cause when u said it i immediately thought of that kid then it played lmao
Let’s gooo
no one thought you were selling the Bronco. you're a good man giving that to your buddies little bro, you should join in for a leg of the run north.
Lincoln’s mullet game is strong 💪
They house looks absolutely amazing. It'll be gorgeous when complete. Keep up the hard work but dont forget to take time for yourself an you family brother🤙
Put a block heater in the Bronco so the block will not freeze in the winter
Replace the bronco with a K5!
Can't wait to see matt and the kids racing go carts and RC cars round that circle out front !
The house is looking really good matt
Bro you need to put a pond with a fountain in the center of the circle driveway.
When did Matt start randomly doing this hardcore vocal fry with his voice? Sounds a male Kardashian sometimes and he hasnt always done it.
😎🤙🦅
I see some SexCevator doin some SexCevating!
Awesome, enjoy it in good health all around!!
New House New Baby!
YOU NEED A LARGE CHRISTMAS TREE 🎄 IN THE CIRCLE OUT FRONT & ROOM TO MANEUVER TO DECORATE IT. HAPPY NEW YEAR 🎉 & HAVE A GREAT DAY 😊.
matt: we’re making the driveway wide enough for my 10,000 friends…. in reality he has over 10M friends
Matt, why not run some large pipe under for driveway for future projects not thought of yet. you could terminate it in the grass in a sprinkler box
of course Meredith wants it Deeper.
Matt I think you need a flagpole in the middle of the circle driveway
Time for some new imagery for the "Off The Ranch" intro.
Matt needs fill dirt Matt needs a huge lake Problem solved
I mean, if you really think about it, pollen is tree semen. So yeah.
One is caught up playing the impassioned protagonist in one’s Subjective Narrative of Self🎈
Do a roof over the the side parking area n maybe go a wide for allow for getting out of vehicle on wet to avoid getting feet in mud. Just install a board behind the n paint it to fill in behind the stove
she got pew hits tile lol
Mere rocking it with the not so small house on the hill. All the design and details look great.
whenever its done you have to get cleetus to come and drift it.
Was just watching yesterday's video and saw the message and then there was the new vid
Needs a giant water er fountain in the front
So happy for you all , sooooo cool you can make mere happy about her new mansion too 😀 its gonna be a nice family home 👍
The plot of land is just as amazing as the house. Congratulations to the Carriker's! As a guy I know there's a small, actually big part of Matt that enjoys the projects, as awesome as it is to get the home complete its also a little sad but its such a big house, the up keep alone will keep you busy.
You should call the place the demomanor
If you are going to have that 6-8 foot drop on backyard, I'd get some nice fence on that so you just don't stroll around and well... walk off on that edge as it's still well within the backyard.
You're a good man Matt! The house looks amazing. Well done sir.
For the pool tile, you want bigger pieces. Overtime those small little ones will start falling off. I see it all the time with the pools I clean. Big tile is much better as it wont chip off like the smaller ones do
Garage parking needs to be deeper for the RV
ya might want your sprinklers run out to the center of your turn around BEFORE you pour the driveway
“Cuz….Alaska is Alaska right now…” Dr. Matt
That can definitely be drifted.
Please tell when done what  the appraisal is
Idk if you like it but a pond with some carp would be sick in the circle of the driveway
that's pretty neat
Future episode...how many guns does it take to eradicate a cedar tree? Get 'em Matt my eyes are killing me. peace y'all
Shaping up to be a great year  ...
You guys should have a mini park in the middle circle in the driveway.
That sir is chemtrails falling down can’t deny that anymore
Thank you for all the video's this week, I've been feeling sick lately and you keep me going. Happy New Year to you and your entire family, Much Love KB.
“ Pollen aye” I felt that on another level😭😩
As a landscape nerd, I can’t wait to see what you do with all that!
That house came along way. I love it.
Matt..as a new ups driver please never return stuff online 😂 not at the new mansion
As I said MATT needs to participate in that trip to Alaska! I Believe He should do the last leg of the trip..!
Those tiles 🤢
What brand and series were the fridge and range? Beautiful!
This videos mostly shows Matt’s hate for pollen
But Matt didn't say, 'Look at that view.'
Some of Mere’s looks at priceless 😊.
Trees to block the view? Trees!  Perhaps rethink that.  Bushes, grass and flowers would be great.  Also trees close to the house create potential for root issues near pipes, as well as interfering with a gorgeous landscape and view.
Пишу по Русски, так как английский знаю плохо. С новым годом тебя, твоим близким и родным здоровья, железного здоровья, тебе того же!! Ты сильно мативируешь, смотря на тебя, я купил 308! Шикарная пушка, жаль, что трудно под неё найти стрельбище. С новым годом бро!!!
As a trucker, I think that oval for grass and trees needs to be smaller. Give a big rig plenty of room to swing a trailer thru orrrrr keep the driveway narrow so the alphabet boys can't bring a mobile command unit it.
Damn u matt and your crappy camera work.... Please for the sake of GOD use a camera man !!! Vertigo gong wild !!!! PUKE... Im now trying to watch in super slow mo. and its still horrible !
“No no no “ Matt * “yes yes yes”😂
That’s a sweet jcb skidsteer
You should hit up aquascapes and do a water feature. Greg the pond guy can set you up right.
YES ITS FINNALY HERE. THE BEGINNING OF SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL
Hey there’s nothing wrong with being picky and knowing what you it makes sure you like what you get
LONG RANGE SHOOTING LANE ON YOUR PROPERTY. please
Imagine if you paved the entire top of the hill, even in the middle. That would be like a huge burnout box
The driveway should be a burnout pad
Your house looks amazing  but why is the pool so small
I Dare you to tell Mere Roman wasn't built in a day ..... LoL
Happy New Year to you all from Katy Texas.
Please consider ditching the grass for native and edible landscaping. It's easier and cheaper to maintain, better for wildlife and the environment, and provides you with food. It's a great learning experience for the kids too
Hey Matt your starting to get a little shaggy around the ears in other words you need a haircut for the Newyear
Wow this is really coming along!
Dang Matt is cranking out a ton of videos for us lately. I'm grateful for the hustle
throw a big ole tree in that circle itd look great
Dr. Carriker. Are you still practicing veterinary medicine? Seems like you’re a very busy man. I always look forward to your videos.
If any vehicle could make it the Bronco could everything important is new and it can go over almost any terrain
1:15 I hope Annie keeps this attitude up until she is an adult and beyond. My daughter is as coockoo as Annie, but she is 25. Love it when you are comfy with how and who you are ❤️
Make the driveway into a go cart track.
oof youre gonna hate the gas stove top.... you should have stuck with induction tops
Looks awesome 😎😎😎😎😎😎
Time for bushes manicured like pews
Perfect , love how it’s all coming together
Which fridge is that? Looks great!
Matt you better be careful your bunker may flood with pew pew food.
little Matt version 2 is a wild child lol
I love the Neature walk reference.  I've thought for YEARS that Matt sounds like the neature walk guy when he says "that's pretty neat."
Scoring an A In Adulting
That driveway is perfect for go-karts just saying
I'm way too emotionally invested in this place at this point I feel like I've actually been there and worked on the place 😅
I've been following the serries from the start and by now i am so exited for you guys to move in. It allmost feels like it me whos moving xd '
Funny. i was thinking the parking cutout was not close to bis enough
not gonna lie, while I like all videos Matt puts out, these are the ones I really look forward too
I have that same thermostat! Carrier infinity systems are nice!
It’s amazing how far the house has come
One of the worst dizzying videos Matt.   😵‍💫 Nice house though.....
Wow. Haven’t watched your videos in a while. But dang the house looks great
Obviously a giant eagle fountain in the middle of the land park
I’m jealous, the new place is coming together quick now, want be to much longer before your in & settling in. Does you have a gun room in the basement Matt?
It is intact, it is beautiful and it is already so beautiful. The end result is sure to be dazzling!
$100 that he lets Cleetus drift that driveway!!!
That circle is perfect for a bass or koi pond!
21k views in 3 minutes 😳
Is the house giving you Gray hair
Love all your videos thanks
when can we see the underground gun bunker?
Are you ever come to finish it
What's the brand of the refrigerator?
That’s a big drift donut driveway!!
Matt needs an Emotional Support Tank
you're going to want power ran to the island forsure
Get another ultra 4
15 min ago,  this was a nice surprise!
From experience run some conduit under the driveway for running future electrical or irrigation or up lighting
Hey Matt! Thank  you for NOT supporting Grecian Formula for Men!!!  LOL!   My brother did that crap for waaayyyy too long!  Obviously, I did NOT! Great video! Ken
Love seeing the little clips at the end of most of the videos over the last couple months. Stick around to the very end, folks!
That's pretty neat.
I think U guys need a Big Fountain/Waterfall in the center of the driveway!
Matt in front of Mere: "I wanted the driveway to be wide enough to pull a tractor trailer through." Matt away from Mere: "I want to drift this thing as many times as i can as soon as it's done."
👍🏻🌻
OMG look great
I can’t believe it’s getting so close to being done I’ve been waiting so long and it’s not even my house
The Bronco is a big vehicle though! It's easily worth two regular sized cars as a replacement!
Landscapers bouta get a big boy check 😅
the house still has a long way to go.
A fish tank would be sick
Definitely need a massive ornamental tree in the middle of the driveway island. Lots of color!
helipad in the middle!
You made an egg shaped corral in the center of your driveway? You do miss your chickens! I dub the hill "Chicken Egg Hill"! Your kids will agree!
EPIC viewing just amazing,
sweet 😁
finally made it in first 20 mins
Looking great! 👍 👌  Might want to think about some type of semi-permeable driveway surfacing as opposed to a hard impermeable surface to help with drainage and not have to worry about a slippery surface due to icy conditions in winter. Just a thought. I've got massive pantry envy Mere, but you must really like cleaning a lot with that hob/oven choice. We've got an electric fan oven & ceramic hob; best things ever in a kitchen when it comes to cleaning and energy bills. I'll never go back to anything else. A quick wipe over & I'm done cleaning. No awkward nooks & crannies to deal with that you can never quite manage to get clean.
Whrere did they move?
The middle of your driveway should be a nice big waterfall
Driveway is going to be sick! Also that's amazing of you to give the Bronco back to Forest and his family
LOL - the wife didn’t seem too keen on “a replacement because of emotional loss”
I’ve visited some friends and family that had a space and hookups for my motorhome and trailer and was a nice easy way to go visit them for a few days. Just a thought.
Don't everybody get all altruistic over the donation of the bronco. Matt is very smart. That bronco is a 100% tax deduction for the company.
Where's the Heli Pad?
in the middle a fountain
Beautiful House.  What kind of fridge is in your kitchen?
What I want to see is Mere picking a vehicle and you fixing it up together with her picking everything she wants out. Make it happen!
Tile was just put in to my new house and when I went to inspect it, I noticed that they put the wrong tile in 😂 now they have to tear it all out and put in the tile I chose.
6:50 🤣🤣
Pool tile but "keep dry"
My eyes lit up as soon as I saw the thumbnail! LFG
Yes finally I’ve been waiting for this!!!
Like how the kitchen is done, esp. how the refrigerator is blended in.
Yes love these videos
Seems like only a few videos ago you were standing on the mound in the middle of the driveway complaining about it lol looks great now
Place reminds me of Waco
Landscaping in December, that's unheard of in colorado. LoL
Just 11 minute..come on Matt..it not enough for me....at least 20 minute or more...
What Fridge is that?
Am I the only one in love with the fridge........and the ENTIRE KITCHEN
Good Morning Everyone, ready to start the day☀️
Matt and the chip off the old block, Linc. See a button press a button
I would wear a mask that says "Pollen Allergy"
what if you need to park the five ton near the house?
this man is working hard
You should have a fountain in the middle of that  round area.
Hey Matt love the content keep it up buddy from-Austin TX
I think you should have a big water fountain in the middle with fish in it because to enjoy light it up at night trees flowers bushes ect how pretty would get be a eye catcher!!
Bro you spent years rebuilding your friends truck to give it back to his brother! Bless you
Southern Indiana is watching.
In the centre circle maybe three palm trees with a very short hedge around the edge and grass all else. Oh I wish, I wish but I don't mind you having the home with a veiw...
Matt you should get your own ford bronco.
Working Hard Mat,,
I remember the first video that’s crazy how far it’s come
Son like father and with the same hair
The landscaping is going to cost more than the house.
What about pipes for an irrigation system for the foliage, especially in the center, before you pour the driveway?
Why no solar panels?
I love the meme clips😂
Damn. The bell do finally be working
The "EGG LAWN" house on the hill with a nice view
How long until Matt or cleetus drift around that circle
I was just watching your end of year video on your other channel…shoot ever pew~pew in your arsenal! That house oh and would you look at that view!!
yoo do a giant fish pond in the circle
Get another Monte Carlo
Go with Forrest to Moab with the CanAm on his trip home. You won’t regret it.
Pitch the driveway "away" from the house this time

That's an awesome race track in front of the house.
NOICE! Happy New Year!

Matt love your videos and your family. Watching your video makes people really feel contacted. You and Mere deserve the best and your hard work is showing keep it up.
