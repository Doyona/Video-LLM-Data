This is an absolutely beautiful video. I felt all the drama!
this shit ass?
dayum that’s dramatic
Omg I'm lov8ng it
Bro this brings back childhood memories your helping me remember bro some things yes  A life promised of evil to rule this dark world   I remember a haunted black dark castle  Dark skies darkness all around me I was terrified  I was scared they chased me  Before the demons came in me   I remember the moon shining brighter than anything representing evil  Very sad very scared crying and screaming  But I remember being blank without emotion at the same time numb bro   The demons made me obsessed with vampires ware wolves emo gothic anything dark and evil  Before GOD woke me right up  He was with me always I was so safe   I spent the last decade fantasising about staying up all night having sex and doing evil in castles   Whoever is ruling us is fucking evil  This is some satanism shit bro   The women have no emotion ice cold don’t fall for the beauty  Look at the Satanists aka rulers of this world and realm   Fight the monster inside  Don’t drink the blood we are not them we fought to death all our lives we are not them  We are not going to hell   Man I feel sick borderline vomiting watching this shit   I was so numb before GOD woke me up numb to everything   Yeppp bloodbaths all of that  This is not what we are this is trauma and demon possession   As a child teen early 20s I was obsessed with this but it’s the demons    We are the sun brother not the moon we are the sun   After being through both I can see what’s evil   You do know the Satanists corrupted vlad Dracula right  He was a heroic righteous man  The Satanists said he drank blood cannablized raped and killed kids none of that was true bro  He was a hero for Christ  Snakes tarnished him   As they did Ragnar lothbrok saying he attacked Roman church he didn’t  All men are fighters but we’re being led by snakes evil liars  How can one lie cause more harm than a murderer  Sons of Satan seed serpant spawn father of all lies bro  Snakes defamed all strong heroic men   I’m nothing like them I been fighting since 10 years old THEOUGH demonicnpossession and childhood trauma
Tapi kalian anggap aku bodoh.  Anggap aku gilak.  Tahankanlah...  Aku hanya mendengar lagu
Mi piace da impazzire ❣️

Well, I'm not a vampire But I feel like one Sometimes I sleep all day Because I hate the sunlight My hands are always shaking Body's always aching And the dark is when I feed Well, I can lure any woman that I want to in my bed With me And whiskey seems to be my holy water Mothers better lock your doors And hide your daughters I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness' sakes Where is my self control? If home is where my heart is Then my heart has lost all hope Well, I'm not a zombie But I feel like one today Self-induced comatose, chemical daze My head is always spinning From this dizzy, blurry vision And my stomach has had enough I feel like a lady That is pregnant with a baby 'Cause I'm always throwing up Hi, my name is Ronnie I'm an addict (Hi, Ronnie) Daddy should've never raised me on Black Sabbath I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness' sakes Where is my self control? If home is where my heart is Then my heart has lost all hope God bless all of you now 'Cause I'm going straight to hell And I'm taking you down with me 'Cause you know damn well I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness' sakes Where is my self control? If home is where my heart is Then my heart has lost all hope All hope All hope
What a masterpiece this music is!   The scream at the end always really gets to me.
What is a gendra of this band?..it is nu metal?,,rap metal?,,rock ballads?,,heavy metal??.
Parabens, chocado
- How much would I pay for a ticket to FIR concert in Royal Albert Hall with London Orchestra? - Yes
His voice 😮❤
Le clip est génial ! Belle mise en scène 🖤
I absolutely love love love this. I can listen to this on repeat all day long.
3:49 ngl my jaw literally dropped
Que perfeição 😭😭
I need Ronnie to write and produce a musical for Broadway.
The lady’s instagram face ruins the impression for me.
Какая у него дикция! Так четко проговариваются и пропеваются слова. В наше время это редкость.
An absolute masterpiece. ❤
С длинными волосами очень красивый ❤❤❤❤❤
Ronnie...please make a song with opera in it. You would nail it!!! You have the most beautiful voice.
Anybody here rn?
TEAR'S & GOOSEBUMPS I'm covered in tears & goosebumps.
Ronnie …. I am now an addict … to the music you put out. This had me screaming at my radio … masterpiece
How absolutely beautiful is Saraya here. My goodness.
This song and video is just a pure MASTERPIECE
Y he have to be a racist so disgusting
So sad at end ☹️
По русски это называется "Эпично". It's just an epic song and music video.
I'm not a vampire, but if I was...
i love this song
Obsessed 😻
Why haven't Ronnie Radke and Jelly Roll produced a song together yet?
man, this song is powerful. what an amazing singer.
2025 and ❤ forevermore
Nobody, absolutely nobody:  Ronnie: yea this song would sound great on piano
Super ❤
Such a magnificent experience.
Well, I'm not a vampire, but I feel like one Sometimes I sleep all day 'cause I hate the sunlight  My hands are always shaking Body's always aching, and the dark is when I feed Well, I can lure any woman that I want to in my bed with me  And whiskey seems to be my holy water And mothers, better lock your doors and hide your daughters  'Cause I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold?

Американская виагра 😅
This is the most underrated thing they ever put out.
This song feels like something from deepest part of soul. Something that really hurts. i dont know, but this song now in my own top 5.
Hi from 2025, Ukraine.
Just got a Skype didn’t come through.
Ronnie's singing is so haunting,, the band is just spellbinding...and  the theatrics  are so rich ♫♪
Yo?! Paige!
Rereading Bram Stoker's Dracula listening to this
💙🐈‍⬛🩸🩸🩸🦇💙
Голос, образ, клип - это разрыв сердца 💔 можно слушать вечно❤❤❤
This man is getting more and more talented in these years🔥
Original version was better. This version feels like Falling in Reverse - I’m not a vampire (meatloaf edition)
Well, Iliya Malinin chose the best song for his ice skating program. Good luck, boy, on 2026 Olympia
Fucking amazing 🔥
Got a right voice this dude ❤
Extremely refreshing indeed.
😮
Thank God Ilia Malinin is not only the current world championship in figure skating, but he has also a great music taste. Otherwise many hidden gems would never come to light...
@3:25 yep.... He did it again
There's the 1% then there's Ronny%
Beautiful
Ronnie needs to stop fat shaming people. Ronnie forgets what he looked like at one point. Aint that that chubs ronsworth?

Una delle canzoni più belle del Suo complesso
God I love this video and this song.
3:33 the mowa cry
This my love this my live
One love
I vove this grupe
Honestly, I truly enjoy both of the songs, this and original.. ... I just got out of treatment, struggling... The anger from my home being robbed, I can't feel anything but anger... I'm so lost
Best in 2026 on love best i love this grupe
Very cool, the song is great, and the video is just like a movie)
So cool
3:44 I SEE!
I call This YESHUA’s Song. 2025.
I do wonder WHY ?  I try to sing. " and whiskey seems to be my holy water "   and.  " daddy should have never raised me on black sabbyya ( Sabbath ) "  in a manner that would make you think I am an opera singer in my bedroom, my poor neighbours. Plus, I piss laughing when he says, " I feel like a lady that is pregnant with a baby cause Im always  throwing up "   Love you RR.
The most beautiful music video ever

Amazing remake...and who is the actress?
Русские видимо еще не добрались до этой песни,значит я первая.) Наши музыкальные блогеры уже как только не прошлись,но женская половина отстаивает свои позиции,и дело не во внешности.Откровенность.Тексты не шаблонные.Человек рассказывает свою историю,через что он прошел.Это уже заслуживает уважение. Про талант и шикарный голос и говорить не стоит,и так все ясно. Ронни,жги,дари людям свой талант,ты прекрасен!❤
Ilia Malinin Brought Me Here
R O N N I E --- Time for a residency in Vegas of all the reimagined and new ones from other songs. I can already imagine how popular it would become. You could call it "Popular Monster - The Ronnie Radke Residency". 🖤
2025 represent
эта вся переделанная сисястая баба вообще тут мимо, с клипа про бардели сбежала
I’m telling my kids this was Nosferatu
One of my favorites!
Wow ,wow ,wow just awesome and can't beat it can't beat Ronnie his band and his absolute musical GENIUS no one will come close. Melds well with other huge stars too keep it going Ronnie we need more.
How am I just now finding this?! Wow!
Great music. Worst lyrics in music history.
Saraya looks beautiful in this video...I guess they lasted until late 2024. 6 years together is a long time for celebrities.
Я сюда не плакать зашла,Ронни😢❤

Man, this is beyond music now. It's a story, short movie, music video... just pure art.
I can never get over how chilling this remake is ❤❤❤
Nobody : Ronnie : Yes all of it.
Yo. That’s it  Refuse from the ashes
Прямо целая опера!
We go when we go its inevitable
He’s so deep as such a talented director
Oh the struts are good I thought it was Ronald in a Gucci mane suit  it's got a happy vibe to it would love to see some music like that come out from you guys. I've listened to all your songs so many times can't wait for something new!
This 6 minute and 17 second music video is better than the entire "Twilight" film series
Прекрасно!!! Я фильм посмотрела. Группа и вокалист открытие для меня.
A father
Это круто🎉❤!
Holy fuck this is beautiful

Співає на разрив і голоса і душі,браво!❤

3:52 I swear to gawd 😂😂😂😂😂 I really like her she was a good one
The Voice of the millenium
En el 2025 con mi loco🖤
Nobody steal this band name idea. Falling in fast forward.
Just an INCREDIBLE remastered song, the script of this, like a super-production, is the best of all time, as dramatic as hell, he has misplaced everything he had to illustrate the lyrics of this song ... I would have missed seeing this artist and these musicians on stage this year ... 3 hours by motorbike for, an incredible show in Toulouse, 4 hours back home was the best thing I’ve ever done in my life ... 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
👍🌹🦇
Клип просто 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Nice ❤ 0:29
Моя любимая песня) маме, папе тоже зашло ахаха
Your voice man!!!!! MAGNIFICENT
Love it❤
Да как же это ох#енно, я аж заплакала😢. Ронни❤
I still get choked up watching and listening to this. The pure agony of love and darkness
4 years later! Still my go to for everything. Love this!

Yassssss 😝🔥
The feelings in this song hit deep! 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
Солнце не убивает вампиров. Только в сказках.
An interview with a Radke 😅
Was this written by an angry 8th grader?
Love him as a vampire
music that evokes emotions, a voice that touches the soul
I wish we could get a visual Falling In Reverse album with this style of symphonic rock. Like where you can watch a MV for each song in order and it's a cohesive storyline (i.e. a musical movie of sorts). I'd kill for that. I hope to seem them live soon. ❤
Se quemó del sol por no tomar vampisol tomen vampisol te da hasta un coloraito trigueñito😅
I love this song ❤ every year !
Lol "reVAMPed"
This song whole is a masterpiece
Goose flesh wiw
This is just weird. Random melodies switching and overlapping, singing just touching the rhythm. But I'm captivated.
0:43 well I'm not a robot, but I feel like one..
On dirait un véritable film de vampires et les effets visuels sont saisissants 🖤🦇❤‍🔥❤‍🔥🦇🖤
Wow this is soo fkng awesome

The captions don’t keep up with the song…soooo meh!
Me he vuelto adicta a esta canción, me encanta el dramatismo épico, estilo el fantasma de la opera, me encanta las tomas grabadas. Chicos, todo está perfectamente coreografiado, el editor y director son genios. Escuchar la versión original jamas te imaginas que algo tan maravilloso pueda salir de ello.
Me alegro mucho d no ser la de ese vídeo.. y ser la diosa Freya , a la sombra estás tú mis y d mi hermana q es más q la d este video. Y a la d mi viejo un poko tb jijiji sos un 5 rey y porq yo amo todo, mi papi un 6+ y mami un 7+ y mana 8+ y yo 9+ . Así es realmente... Seguíd retorcidos d envidia, poq así si es .. soy lo máximo ❤ asiq si soys envidiosos los Loli torres q sip ... A mí me la tenéis porq nunca soy como me tratáis ... Podrios basura envidiosa. No entro +.
Q asco d imbéciles me hacen sufrir con sus cosas raras d ellos q no me pasan y exandome a pelear con los mios q nunca pueden , eres un vampi si y me kiere para ti solo... Por eso lo hace, q si mii mami no me kiere me deja con un mafioso q mi hermana es laq gusta y yo este feo cara pedo .. 😢 quien son ? Seguro q mi padre para ver si le kiero. 😅
What are some insane dramatic songs like this?
How am I just now hearing this... it's like a short epic reel. I now would like to see a full featured film! With vocals outside of most mortals range.  😮
I still can't fathom the fact that I'm almost 40yo, and I was always a fan of metal, grunge, rap and punk, I stanned all the big 90s bands like Manson, Korn, NIN, SOAD, Papa Roach, Cypress Hill, Eminem, and a bunch of french neometal. And I slept on FIR until the last year. It's unbelievable. Like, I discovered this amazing person in 2024. It's like finding a hidden secret decades after the fact... and I'm so glad about it.
This guy is incredible and he can act, direct, sing, scream and play instruments ❤
June 29, 2025 Anyone? 🖤🫶🤘
The fact that we are meant to think we are insane.....  the fact that we are all on the same level in the same game living the same fucked up. Lie .. is more fucked up than anybody can even realize
Well, I'm not a vampire But I feel like one Sometimes I sleep all day Because I hate the sunlight My hands are always shaking Body's always aching And the dark is when I feed Well, I can lure any woman that I want to in my bed With me And whiskey seems to be my holy water Mothers better lock your doors And hide your daughters I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness' sakes Where is my self control? If home is where my heart is Then my heart has lost all hope Well, I'm not a zombie But I feel like one today Self-induced comatose, chemical daze My head is always spinning From this dizzy, blurry vision And my stomach has had enough I feel like a lady That is pregnant with a baby 'Cause I'm always throwing up Hi, my name is Ronnie I'm an addict (Hi, Ronnie) Daddy should've never raised me on Black Sabbath I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness' sakes Where is my self control? If home is where my heart is Then my heart has lost all hope God bless all of you now 'Cause I'm going straight to hell And I'm taking you down with me 'Cause you know damn well I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness' sakes Where is my self control? If home is where my heart is Then my heart has lost all hope All hope All hope

Saraya tho 🌹🌹🌹
Ronnie, and the band. you stand up for truth and honesty for so many of us. your message is truth and laying out that honesty and rising up against your own vulnerability and telling it no matter what. you are a true warrior to do what you do and sing. you have to know you are our hero for doing what you/ do speak to all of us because we are all damaged.. Rock on and keep doing what you do. we relate to all your lyrics and you're just a beautiuful breath of fresh air. been following you since Escape the Fate i worked with one of your guitar players mom. yall were just kids.  remember Clockwise? about those years..Keep your voice and path. We love you!!!!!!!
I love this man... so talented. 🖤🩶
he gets it.
Lovvvvvvve love love his revamped songs. I still listen to all his old stuff. Used to feel like a outsider for being the only person in my family and my group of friends that listened to Rock and heavy metal. I didnt care. I like being the loner.
I meed therapy because i couldnt stop thinking about how you were rowing in a circle, dont know if it was on purpose but you were never going to reach that portal Richie
Love the song, but it's really hypocritical to make a TikTok claiming that you bullied theater kids in school when your own music sounds like this.
This song has me on an emotional roller coaster 🎢 😂 beautiful, dramatic, definitely could be made into a movie. 10/10 better than the twilight series 😂
Mate I really don't like this New video ok! I liked the old video ok.😮
Nope I loved the old video ok.😮
I don't like this New version ok
"if god is a weapon and god is a women than man is a devil and the devil is a shield" hmmm
Great song about opiate addiction If u kno u kno 😩❤️♥️🖤
Please dear god do a live concert in South Africa!! We need it :D !!
Wow 😨 🤯🫡
This is their first song I ever heard, because my mother showed me (stg) and I assumed Ronnie sang like this all the time. Now we are going to see them in September. What a wild ride
Amazing ❤
Oh man your songs keep amazing me❤️❤️❤️.

Ronnie you are killing it fire can't even keep up your just to out of this world talented they just can't grasp it this video your voice stop me in my tracks took my breath who the fuck is this OMG I couldn't stop listening to it I had to call me son. then I had to here more❤ this young man is going to blow the world a part with truth they can't handle. and look hear look at what you have become I'm over whelmed by your true soul and the band your on stoppable and then you jellyroll  Then kicked ass a again then Manson hell fucken yes❤ I could go on and on but I will always support you  long live not just rock and roll but live rock and roll I'm a 58 year old handicapped women and you and music is what gets me through my day❤
Hey Meatloaf, hold my beer.
I can't believe I went multiple years of my life without hearing this masterpiece holy shit
I misheard heard  "if home is where my heart is then my heart has lost all hope"  as  "my heart has lost a home"  i feel like it still kinda works haha
The song is so powerful, the way you refer to those with mental health, how it can drain them around. When you find the one anchor that holds you to life, and when it is lost, at the same time you find out that you depend on each other to survive. You really show how depression and anxiety can affect your life. Thank you for fighting for mental health, it doesn't always make it easier for yourself, but it creates a path for those who come after.
💆‍♂️
All you hates don't like don't lessen.
I literally never notice the woman is Paige!
Absolut cinema

2025 button👇
This band kicks ass
I have heard some of his songs but just heard bad  boy on my 🚗  radio. Loved it. Now I'm checking out all of his music.
Just heard this song for the first time.  Wow.  I've been sleeping on godsmack.  Just wow thought they were hard metal.
25 / 05/ 2025 A theatrical storm of anguish and redemption — this version breathes cinematic blood into every note. Years have passed, yet this song still claws at the soul with renewed fury and grandeur. Ronnie doesn’t just sing… he resurrects. "I’m Not A Vampire (Revamped)" feels like a confession scrawled on the walls of a haunted opera. Dark. Lavish. Undeniably immortal. 🩸🕯🖤
Woah
this guy is an absolute douche lmao. why to profit on the "wealthy" lmao 150K? guy is a chode
Hi 2026!!! Anybody?
So is that saraya ?
Imagine Ronnie redoing Sweeney Todd The Rock Opera
Epic stuff if was a show I'd watch :}.
It’s Paige!!!
Duas versões e amo ambas. O Ronnie é incrivel, não tem explicação gente
Amazing! Listen to god is a weapon and now all of these He’s an amazing artist!! 🖤🖤🖤
Questo è il top.
como siempre falling in reverse rodeado del mejor equipo de rodaje❣
Dana Dentata is stunning here! OMG, I am in love with this songs and the music video is AWESOME !!! Can't stop listening it on repeat!
RONNIE COME TO BRAZIL!!!

Немероятният Стенли никога не разочарова❤
Thanks for that ❤
Absolute cinema.
We need a falling in reverse  reimagined tour
Se twilight fosse stato così, sarebbe stato il mio film preferito in assoluto
I don't know you guys's hopefully only just a friendship but an ally acquaintance etcetera
As a grief stricken young widow and mom, thank you from the bottom of my soul for this one.
Bohemian Rhapsody 2021
You are special. Never forget it. Great songs.
Super !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hey. It have already almost a bottle of Jim B. in my system and I understand the "holy water" reference. It makes things clearer - I think.
Just learning this music this guy is a frigging genius
FIR forever 🖤
Well, I'm not a vampire, but I feel like one Sometimes I sleep all day 'cause I hate the sunlight My hands are always shaking Body's always aching, and the dark is when I feed Well, I can lure any woman that I want to in my bed with me  And whiskey seems to be my holy water And mothers, better lock your doors and hide your daughters  'Cause I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold? For goodness sake, where is my self-control? If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all hope  Well, I'm not a zombie But I feel like one today Self-induced comatose, chemical daze  My head is always spinning from this dizzy blurry vision and my stomach has had enough I feel like a lady that is pregnant with a baby 'cause I'm always throwing up  And hi, my name is Ronnie, I'm an addict And daddy should've never raised me on Black Sabbath  I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold? For goodness sake, where is my self-control? If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all hope  When will you mortals believe? (he's not a vampire) I just want the world to bleed (he's not a vampire) Lust at the sight of your blood (he's not a vampire) I swear to God, I am not a (he is not a) (He is not a)  So God bless all of you now 'Cause I'm going straight to hell (straight to hell) And I'm taking you down with me Because you know damn well  So I sharpen my teeth 'cause I love the way it feels When I sink into your skin and draw the only thing that's real You don't believe me, should I write it in blood? You better drive that fucking stake right down my heart and try to run Motherfucker, I'm a vampire!  And I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold? For goodness sake, where is my self-control? If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all Heart has fucking lost all Heart has lost all hope (He's lost all hope) (He's lost all hope) (He's lost all hope) All hope, my heart has lost all hope
He has my heart. Dark, chaotic...

Anyone 2025
I like ... good very good... me gusta mucho adoro este artista
you;re not fooling anyone
I wish he would do movies. I bet he could do some really great things with Anne Rice's Vampire world. Everyone seems to fuck it up but I think he'd do a great job on it.
🤍🪡
Thanks to daddy and mummy for giving you such a great vocal and creativity!
I found a white feather I think that mean ancestors have time say something feel like it's to you
Is it Saraya/Page ? oO
Goosebumps❤
Classic
A Real Masterpiece
It's not a song. It's a movie. Not the ending I wanted but still.. I love it!
Is this the precuel of Interview with the Vampire?
I can't help but comment eveeytime I visit the song lmao...
damn🔥
This was better than Queen of the damned. This was the vampire movie I always cried for.
Tequila. But I'll settle on rum. 😢
Essa foi minha música favorita do falling in reverse por muito tempo 😅
I’m not as familiar with what this type of music would be called, I listen to music like this but I can’t really nail down what it would be called. Does anybody have any suggestions of songs like this, that makes things like the screaming, the rock themes, the overall voice and long notes, and that more orchestral composition?
RIP Derek jones , this music is so amazing and he has amazing voice ,i enjoy listening to his music
マリニン様からきました
This is one of the best, well crafted stories ever written.
I feeeel it in my booo-oooooneeeees!
RONNIE DRIED OUT 😭😭😭😭😭😭👇 LIKE FOR ME TO GO TO HIS CONSURT
Looooove ❤Bite me Ronnie, My favorite vampire🦇 🦇
Look @Paige
😢
Here because of Ilia Malinin 🤭
Genius. I am an addict of this song.
Holy fuck dude now that is breathtaking ❤
This is amazing, Rock metal, operatic, story telling, beautiful, well constructed. More please.
This guy speaks everything in my head... Its insane
2025
Hey! Did you know ilia malinin a figure skater in the Olympics just used Ronnie’s song “I’m not a vampire” the reimagined version! It was posted a few days ago just type in “ilia malinin lands 6 quads”.
Kinda reminds me of Scars "Be Prepared" song...
2025 😢❤
my type of video
A masterpiece. I can hear and see it again an again. The song, text… this great voice! Fantastic!!
Ilia Malinin's song ❤️ 😍 💖 ❣️ 💕
His voice is just so incredible!! It amazes me every single! Time! It’s crazy man lol wow
この曲がスケートにぴったりなんて思わなかった！大好き！
That boy cannot only skate, but he picked a great song!
Falling In Reverse - “I am not a Vampire" (revamped) ! Ilia Malinin is terrible on this masterful piece : )) A real killer: Ilia Malinin did well to choose it and experience it, to make us experience it and learn more about the revamped part
This song is fregon AH MAYYYYZZINGGH !!!!❤❤❤❤
Falling In Reverse - « Je ne suis pas un vampire (remanié) » Ilia Malinin est terrible sur ce magistral morceau : ))   A real killer: Ilia Malinin did well to choose it and experience it, to make us experience it and learn more about the revamped part
These reimagined versions really make you think if all those pop/punk songs we fell in love with in the 2000s really had more meaningful (and dark) messages.
What a fkn masterpiece - still after 4 years
⛸️
Aí meu deus como eu amo
Dracula
Here from ilia malinin! Love how the younger generation are getting to be more creative w the songs they skate to
Ilia Malinin brought me here. WOW on his performance and great song choice!
That ending gets my blood a boilin
This song is gonna get a nice boost, was just used in the routine of the guy who won the world title
I think it's freaking awesome that ILia Malinin used this song in his program that won the 2025 World Title Figure Skating Team USA! Let's Go FIR and Team USA!❤💯
came here from Ilia Malinin 😭
I’ve just come from world champion skater Ilia Malinin and he skated to this. I’m not currently obsessed with this song!
Who found this song after the performance of Ilia (figure skating)
Heard this today while watching ice skating, no joke. Looked it up and now a total fan. Or should that be fang.....
omg,is more than amazing...........im so impressed ........love it
Spectacular!
Do u think he knows the winning men’s figure skater used this song lol, I just wanna know what he thinks😂
this is so ass ngl. Like the original song was also pretty bad but at least it was kinda fun? The lyrics totally don't suit this vibe and the instrumentals just feel like some fanmade edit. If you think this is good I urge you to expand your taste
you fell off
Song for the movie nostradamus❤❤❤
And news at 11 ....delivery driver killed after apparently stepping into a customers house....lured in by the offer of home cooked s'mores bread (that the wife made) lmao  JK ! Lol
Amazing ❤
Beautiful

Wait!!.....so Ronnie was a vampire?! Even though he said he wasn't....!!!! MIND BLOWN!!!
If I was a legitimate vampire, this would be my jam
Entretien avec un vampire
Wow sick graphics and really cool spooky house looks vintage! I am doing better today just have whiplash! Your music videos make me happy because I hear voices too your not alone kids if your feeling bad reach out to a trusted adult or google the Samaritans they have a chat line for suicide prevention.  Also think 988 is the national hotline.

hi 2025  who waching?
Эх, прошу тебя! Продолжай давить на нервы! Сиси писи, то си боси - и прочее говнище никогда не переведётся! А таких как ты - мало!
Why is this so amazing though
Masterpiece...
I am still soooo very addicted to this masterpiece ❤❤❤
masterpiece
Where's the love button
Magnificent.
Im feeling a strong Tim Curry vibe here.  Love this goth version!  Bravo!
This dude is too much... what a gift.  He can do metal, rap, and sing like this. Just, wow.
Wow this one is amazing. 💜
Ронни ....Ты покорил моё сердце,я влюбилась.Благодорю.....Ты пробуждаешь во мне те чувства которые я себе запретила.
why do i recently know about this song? i lost years of my life
2025.2.22
Musikgenie ❤❤  Lebensgeschichte 😮 durch die Hölle ins Licht 😊 wünsche ihm alles erdenklich Gute ❤❤ immer mit Kopf nach oben stehend durch das Leben gehen,  danke für deine Texte und Musik
*O.M.F.G! HOW IS HE THIS GOOD?!?* Just found this version, and I’m absolutely speechless. I don’t even know how to process what I just heard—do I scream, cry, or just sit here in awe? The emotion, the power, the sheer genius… Ronnie is on another level.   Wish I could say this to him, haha.   🔥🖤  Also, I never thought I’d find a better Lestat than Stuart Townsend… but I’m seriously reconsidering.
God bless all of you now 'Cause I'm going straight to hell And I'm taking you down with me 'Cause you know damn well I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? Wow. Just..........wow.
Hey Ronnie   question ?
How TF have I slept on this band...what the hell yalls
Ronnie kinda looks like snape here
Ronnie Revamping his own songs is something more artists need to do. Rather than remaking others.
tonight i dreamed the lyrics "self induced, comatose, chemical daze - my head is always spinning from this dizzy blurry vision and my stomach has had enough! i´m feeling like a lady that is pregnant with a baby cause i´m always throwing up..."  😅
🤫🤥🤭🤑
Это шедевр! Простите мой французский
This is better than some movies!  Kudos Ronnie!!
Og was better ngl
This song is what made me like their band 🔥  And when I look at some of his work, Ronnie is an amazing musician. In addition to being good at stringing words together, he is also great at creating concepts. 🔥🔥  I don't know how much money they spend on each of their CRAZY video clips?!! 🔥🔥🔥
Мужик - это офигенно! Интервью с вампиром на 99%, но круто!
akárhányszor hallgatom, kiver a víz a mondanivalója valóságától, imádom és elszörnyedek...
my fav part was when he lost his jacket while running! (jk!!!) amazing vid and song hehe
He looks so different without tattoos
.. 🕸️Excellent 🕸️..!!
Proper chills just so powerful ❤
フィギュアスケート選手のイリア・マニリンさんのフリー演技でこの曲が使われていたので聴きにきました。

Makes me think of the journey of the "dark night of the soul" 💜
closest thing to a real vampire here. med condition e.p.p. and ive lost all hope
Powerful! As always! It's unnatural how good this guy is!

Late to the party but the song and video made my blood feel like ice. I can feel every hair on my body standing up. An absolute masterpiece ❤
such talent honestly
I would love to see interpretation of the original Phantom of the opera monster type video and classical/rock Phantom of the Opera song. ~
Por muito tempo essa foi minha música favorita do falling in reverse 😅
It's almost like he wrote the original knowing he was gonna do this. It's too perfect.
My drug since 3 years now
Saraya is seriously so beautiful her hair amd just your whole vibe together is 💎😍🫣 can we get ronald to fall and write a love ballad for her is the question?
See now i need a Falling In Reverse & Evanescence Collab for one of these.

Well, I'm not a vampire but I feel like one Sometimes I sleep all day Because I hate the sunlight My hands are always shaking Body's always aching, in the dark is when I feed Well, I can lure any woman that I want to in my bed With me And whiskey seems to be my holy water Mothers, better lock your doors And hide your daughters I'm insane, well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness sakes Where is my self-control? If home is where my heart is then my heart has lost all hope Well, I'm not a zombie but I feel like one today Self-induced comatose, chemical daze My head is always spinning from this dizzy blurry vision And my stomach has had enough I feel like a lady that is pregnant with a baby 'Cause I'm always throwing up Hi, my name is Ronnie, I'm an addict (Hi Ronnie!) Daddy should've never raised me on Black Sabbath I'm insane, well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness sakes Where is my self-control? If home is where my heart is then my heart has lost all hope God bless all of you now 'Cause I'm going straight to hell And I'm taking you down with me 'Cause you know damn well I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? I'm insane, well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness sakes Where is my self-control? If home is where my heart is then my heart has lost all hope All hope, ohh
The current world figure skating championships skates to this, and it's FABULOUS.
2025 here and still blasting this shit!! The mutha fuckin goat
INAV was the first song by FIR i ever heard
I necer knew this happened
I'm just going to keep saying it there's no reason at all why Falling in Reverse couldn't spearhead a amazing version of Phantom of the Opera holy crap this has to happen man like there is nobody else more fit to take that role you can hear it in his voice just imagine think of me sang by him just gives me chills thinking about it
Paige 🤤🤤

Isso é uma das coisas mais lindas que já vi...
Esta terraformación es solo 1 más de las de mi poder supremo esencial base de crecimientos de todas las mentalidades; si; Tranquila.
bravo
Los camicaces de la nave solar con su escudo tambien sacan puntos en el chess de guerras; si; yo nunca pierdo; y no tengo familia; nadie es mi familia; Tranquila; si...
Que buenorra podría estar mi mano con medalla de oro de la caña amarilla; si; tranquila.
😊
Los asesinen o no los asesinen, la justicia no existe; si.
Yo no ordeno quien se encargará, si... En mi idioma.

All   I  can say    is spectacular

Soo fcking Epic. Timeless Art to me.
1:50 - 2:11 sounds like it should be in a movie trailer, its perfect and i love it sooooo much
Wait Is that his current gf? Looks like her!

I love this band so much. I appreciate their continued dedication, and growth as a band. The videos are amazing and better than movies. A fan from the 1st time I listened, and a fan until the end.  💫✨”🖤”✨❤️✨🤘✨💫

Rayos como me encantan estas  cosas ❤❤❤❤ jejejeee 😂
Anyone here because of that ice skating video on Tik Tok?
illa malinin ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Me quedo tiesa <3<3<3🤩😍
this video reminds me of Twilight
Why does he Always end up kneeling on stone at the alter to the heavens?
Tutorial on how to over-dramatize.
Would love to hear more classical vocals he has it~ Phantom of the Opera inspired video would be amazing ~ ❤ I remember watching this when it came out and still love it. The video, sound, costumes, and everyone involved the choir and all. Just great.
Hey, uh...why do the daughters need to be hidden?
Not sorry for this Saraya was the main character of this video
😅😅😅😅😅
His music reaches into your soul,and wakes you up.
If this man was to write and act in a Broadway show I would watch in a heartbeat. His voice is so beautiful and he has such amazing range.
The re_imagined and re_vamped should be called "standing in neutral" 😂😂
Literally heard this when the figure skateing competition was on. One of the guys was doing a routine to it.
Just heard this in an ice skating program.
Thank you Ilia Malinin for bringing me here! ⛸️
What da fuck i just watch
Fokiu
Ronnie is absolutely NAILING the Witcher 3 vibes with his remasters <3
OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG This is moving beyond belief. WOW!
This is PERFECTION. What a lyrical masterpiece. I love the og, but this is FUXKING BEAUTIFUL. 🖤
🤘🤘
Just one word......EPIC. Video, music and of course the voice.
It’s been a terribly too long I’ve heard something so powerful  Those moments You never forget when and where you were the first time you heard it Ronnie keep on
Came after Ilya Malinin's figure skating❤

Looks like a younger snape
I'm drawn to the Chaotic.

I love their music, my 9 yr old daughter loves their videos. Caught her singing this one yesterday 😂 I was so proud
Lyrics:  Well, I'm not a vampire But I feel like one Sometimes I sleep all day Because I hate the sunlight My hands are always shaking Body's always aching And the dark is when I feed Well, I can lure any woman that I want to in my bed With me And whiskey seems to be my holy water Mothers better lock your doors And hide your daughters I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness' sakes Where is my self control? If home is where my heart is Then my heart has lost all hope Well, I'm not a zombie But I feel like one today Self-induced comatose, chemical daze My head is always spinning From this dizzy, blurry vision And my stomach has had enough I feel like a lady That is pregnant with a baby 'Cause I'm always throwing up Hi, my name is Ronnie I'm an addict (Hi, Ronnie) Daddy should've never raised me on Black Sabbath I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness' sakes Where is my self control? If home is where my heart is Then my heart has lost all hope God bless all of you now 'Cause I'm going straight to hell And I'm taking you down with me 'Cause you know damn well I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness' sakes Where is my self control? If home is where my heart is Then my heart has lost all hope All hope All hope

Кто ещё здесь ,после выступления Ильи Малинина ? И эта тема про вампира класс !! ,и программа  Ильи просто космос , фантастическая !  Все сложилось - понравилось очень и музыка и фантастический Илья !
The pediatrician George RR Martin.  Doc Martens.
Ilia Malinin made me discover Falling in Reverse and I am now obsessed
Ilia Malinin  2024 ⛸️
THIS IS A MASTERPIECE
Note that the crowd doesn't hurt him but just abandons him to self destruct. The self destructive tendencies, the "sins", don't just kill him but harm everyone he loves as well.
Found after watching Malinin
Ronnie I was never into this kind of music or something like that, but I listen to your song and I loved it
Y por supuesto Falling In Reverse - "I'm Not A Vampire es brutal , increible y maravilloso. Tanto la cancion como el video evidentemente son de otro nivel, diferente multiverso.
Major respect for Ronnie for this one
They do not make just music!!! They fucking make art!!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤
Ronnie must be a real vampire cuz he looks really young!!
That’s so sad, they weren’t hurting anybody, leave us Vampires alone dammit!
Remasterpiece'd
Go ilia mailnin !
Even with 19 million views on a video I still feel this version of this song is underappreciated and deserves more recognition.
Did anyone else notice that he covered his tattoos?
love this song so much
Вы чувствуете здесь вайб Призрака оперы? Это невероятно!
Lol I see what you did there revamped😆
I've watched this so many times it is just such a beautiful movie and a phenomenal rendition of this masterpiece. Ronnie Radke is truly  an amazing and talented musician and entertainer. I'd love to see him in feature films. He would definitely dominate the cinema and give the fake woke hollyweirdo celebrities a run for their money. Haha.
super!!!!!
Sooo true. My Mother committed suicide and I was forced to watch. My Dad raised me. Such sadness. May the "bearer of light" from the "morning star" shine down apon you to send you home.
what a fucking wonder masterpiece.
OK BUT WHY DOES IT GO SO HARD
dang how he looks on that one is something 😍 that shy look goes him so well too like literally makes him hella cute there
But, he's so nice to look at though ❤
my daily ritual consists of this song and the drug in me is you
Masterpiece ❤❤❤

Lyrics : • Well, I'm not a vampire, But I feel like one. Sometimes I sleep all day, 'Cause I hate the sunlight. My hands are always shaking, Body's always aching And the dark is when I feed. Well, I can lure any pretty woman that I want to in my bed With me. And whiskey seems to be my holy water. And mothers better lock your doors And hide your daughters.  'Cause I'm insane... Well, I can feel it in my bones. Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold ? For goodness' sakes, Where is my self control ? If home is where my heart is, Then my heart has lost all hope !  Well, I'm not a zombie, But I feel like one.  Today self-induced, comatose, chemical daze ! My head is always spinning From this dizzy, blurry vision And my stomach has had enough ! I feel like a lady That is pregnant with a baby, 'Cause I'm always throwing up.  And hi, my name is Ronnie, I'm an addict. And daddy should've never raised me on Black Sabbath !  I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones ! Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold ? For goodness' sakes, Where is my self control ? If home is where my heart is, Then my heart has lost all hope !  When will you mortals believe ?!  (He's not a vampire !) I just want the world to bleed !  (He's not a vampire !) Lust at the sight of your blood !  (He's not a vampire !) I swear to God, I am not a- ! (He is not a- !)  (He is not a- !)  So God bless all of you now, 'Cause I'm going straight to hell ! And I'm taking you down with me, Because you know damn well !  So I sharpen my teeth, 'Cause I love the way it feels... When I sink into your skin  And draw the only thing that's real. You don't believe me, Should I write it in blood ? You better drive that fuckin' stake  Right through my heart and try to run ! Motherfucker, I'm a vampire !!  'Cause I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones !! Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold ?! For goodness' sakes, Where is my self control ?! If home is where my heart is, Then my heart has lost all- Heart has fucking lost all- Heart has lost all hope !!  (He's lost all hope.) (He's lost all hope.) Lonely !! (He's lost all hope.) My heart has lost all hope. •
Epicaaaaaaa madre mia que voz
The term "genius" should be used sparingly and rarely. But this song is unbelievable! I've played it almost every night for 6 months now, and I'm still playing it. It really gets to the heart of what a vampire is c.f, Fulcanelli - Dwelling Houses of the Philosophers"
Moore John Walker Melissa Jones Ronald
Oh my god, this is amazing! Thank you for this storm of emotions. From Russia with love!
Through in a pit of 🐍 will I go mad or will I become one or will I died from their bites for being hungry.  Or will I eat them all to survive   Atlas knew 🤔
4 years ago, but still having goosebumps.......
Movie scenario ❤
Bring the stakes and a bunch of garlic please 😭
Spoiled the end of Demon Slayer thanks
I discovered Falling in Reverse 2 weeks ago, now I know all the songs, watched interviews and I bought the concert tickets.Every time I listen to this and Last Resort I burst into tears. All the others make me dance, get angry, enjoy, vent... I even started taking a fry scream class. Ronnie is an absolute genius.He climbed my personal charts and took the number one spot. I'm 41 and I'm so fucking happy to listen him sing. All the best, Ronald. You deserve it.
Got to be careful when you are listening to this song. 😭
Ilia Malinin - Free Programm. Season 2024-25! Figure Skating! Good Luck!!! Love You! 🔥💪❤

Well im here because of Illia Malinin FS 😅 love the song
World Champion and QuadGod Ilia Malinin (USA) is using INAV(R) for his Free Skate this season.  Looks like it will be a masterpiece of a program to this brilliant masterpiece of music.
After watching Ilia Malinin’s figure skating performance, I discovered this song … fall in love with it🥹
I was trying to figure out why Ronnie looked different besides his hair and clothes and I realized that they covered up all of his tattoos!! It looks so weird! Ronnie is one of those people who are meant for tattoos!
Hey Ronnie, let’s just I’ll remember that you killed that girl😊
OMG Ronnie you fucking rock .. Totally utterly amazing .I just went to see You in consecutive at the New Jersey PNC on September the 14 th  You were totally fucking awesome I'm 54 and have always been a country fan untill my son introduced me to you and let me tell you i totally love you your voice just blows me away 🎉❤❤❤❤
p
Whoooooo why am I only seeing it now!? Everything I ever wanted but didn't know lol (also gets the eyeliner out).
the Vampire Lestat would have loved this song
This is F8k8ng Amazing!!!!
Saraya is so danm gorgeous it's INSANE ❤❤❤❤❤❤
I love how he screams the lyrics at the end. It just cuts through all the bs, and you think, "damn, what is wrong with me?"
♉Ronnie a good actor, and his videos are not inferior to Hollywood, a true masterpiece of cinematography  ... And as vocal as a nightingale ...♉
i am also lost and adictive. My hands are always shaking. Yes, it is. It is true.
Who’s here in 2024
Omg again my heart falling in reverse are literally the avengers of rock every video is like a movie ❤
I'm sitting on a chair and petting my black cat slowly with a smirk on my face..
Your voice is like the sounds of the Angels coming down from the clouds parting from heaven! The fact that you can rap you can rock you can sing you can do all the things and I freaking love you I love falling in reverse you guys are my absolute fav I literally get goosebumps every time you sing and I can't say that I get that moved or inspired by anybody else on so many different songs that they put out this will always go down in history as one of my favorites by you but I love all your songs and I wish you would come back to New Hampshire because that was an experience of a lifetime
Loki?
The guy looks like Young Severus Snape....
2024?
This is one of the most beautiful songs and music videos out there.
Did yall notice that saraya is in this
Hated this band when they came out. These days dropping the best songs around! Best metal glow-up around!
Falling in Reverse: The Musical: Part One   i just have to say. wow. i heard the og and was like "eh, not bad" then I heard this and I was like "OH MY GOD THIS IS FUCKING INSANE."
I can't stop crying
when man, reclaims, there divine masculinity. weak man pandemic, men have been misled. welcome the rise of true masculine men. taking responsibility, accountability, no longer predators, but provider and protectors. mind, body and spirit work.
It was the first time I watched this video...I was glued to the screen from the beginning...WTF
Ronnie is literally making his own MOVIESSSS, I'm almost ashamed in myself for not discovering this sooner, this is absolutely jaw dropping and spine chilling!!
Hes singing on behalf of all men. All men are insane.
❤❤❤❤❤
Interview with the vampire core 🫦
"I feel like a lady who's pregnant with a baby 'cause I'm always throwing up" 😂
It is strange that the universe only alerted me to your music now in life, but can tell you this:   Your productions are friggen awesome. Keep it up. But don't let companies take you for a ride in terms of costs of creating these music videos. Know your worth.
❤❤❤
❤❤❤
I'd like to see this done to Zombified and call that version Reanimated.
Hello Ronnie You Donation roupa versão antiga

Well I'm not a vampire Я, конечно, не вампир, But I feel like one Но чувствую себя таким. Sometimes I sleep all day Сплю порою целый день, 'Cause I hate the sun-light Ведь мне солнца свет невыносим. My hands are always shaking Мои руки вечно трясутся, Body's always aching А тело всё время болит. And the dark is И, единственно, только ночами When I feed Просыпается мой аппетит.   Well I can lure any woman Любая из женщин будет моей, That I want to in my bed with me Раз задумал её соблазнить.  Помоги мне, Господь! Where is my self control? Я собой не владею всецело. If home is where my heart is Говорят, что дом твой, где сердце, Then my heart has lost all hope Значит, сердце моё очерствело.   When will you mortals believe? (He's not a vampire) О, смертные, когда же вы поймёте наконец? (Он не вампир) I just want the world to bleed (he's not a vampire) Что этот мир в крови я утоплю без сожаленья. (Он не вампир) Lust at the sight of your blood (he's not a vampire) Вид крови у меня рождает вожделение (он не вампир) I swear to God, I am not a (he is not a) Я Богу клянусь, что я не (он не ...)   (He is not a) Он не…   So God bless all of you now Благослови вас Господи! А я 'Cause I'm going straight to Hell (straight to Hell) Отправлюсь прямиком к воротам Ада. And I'm taking you down with me Хотел бы всех вас утащить туда. Because you know damn well... Ведь, черт возьми, теперь скрывать не надо, что я...   So I sharpen my teeth 'cause I love the way it feels Мои зубы остры, предвкушая этот пир, When I sink into your skin Когда вмиг пронзая плоть, And draw the only thing that's real Я добываю эликсир. You don't believe me Вы мне поверьте! Should I write it in blood? Роспись кровью нужна? You better drive that fucking stake right down my heart Лучше в сердце кол воткните And try to run И бегите от меня! Motherfucker, I'm a vampire! Я, черт возьми, вампир!   And I'm insane Просто я схожу с ума. I can feel it in my bones И чую всем нутром своим, Coursing through my veins, Как стынет в жилах кровь моя. When did I become so cold? Когда же я стал холодным таким? For goodness sakes, Помоги мне, Господь! Where is my self-control? Я собой не владею всецело. If home is where my heart is, Говорят, что дом твой, где сердце, Then my heart has lost all Значит, сердце моё очерствело. Heart has fucking lost all Сердце потеряло всякую надежду. Heart has lost all hope Сердце потеряло эту чёртову надежду. (He's lost all hope) (Он потерял всякую надежду) (He's lost all hope) All hope (Он потерял всякую надежду) Всякую надежду (He's lost all hope) Он потерял всякую надежду My heart has lost all hope Мое сердце потеряло всякую надежду.

Wow
I am lestat.
Huge from big mo Richard.
Hi from lestat
Hi from big mo
🏳‍🌈
Just WOW. Im so grateful to be finding Ronnie's older music now. He's the essence of Epic 🔥🫶
I love it ❤
jojo music: to be continued
He has such an ethereal voice 😮‍💨🥰 I cannot get over how talented he is
I love it!❤
I love this WTF
I'll have you know, I rocked my son to sleep while listening to your amazing range here.
I cant see the comment now but the guy who said this should be a movie!!! 100000% agree!!!!!!
I get such Ice Kill Nine vibes from FiR when I listen to them for some reason..........Works for me as IKN kicks much ass, as do FiR. Anyone else?
Someone in some other band should recruit this guy's voice to do some more normal music and see how he does, Neverending White Lights style like how Dallas Green/City & Colour got started.
His run at 3:38 😭😭😭
Dude!!!! For some reason I never let myself listen to this version, no idea why, it's friking insane!! As expected tho bc this is Ronnie so hell yeah man!!!  Fireee 🔥🔥
How did I miss Falling In Reverse! Senior Citizen here… WOW!!
Fz was here !
You are so creative!!!!
Omg i just fully cried
THIS IS ONE, OF THE GREATEST THINGS, I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE, OMG. OMG. OMG.
Awesome! /,,/
I don't like watching Ronnie die
Whiskey was my favorite too...I stay up all night sleep all day
Ronnie is a GENIUS.
Could you love one woman if she gives you love to suck instead of blood? I think hard if you look so good😅but what if you ask what you seek...full love...and instead of looking to neighbours grass weeding yours ...what if you could say that you need all love Not part? I think if a vampire can feed with love he stops the feeding?😊 but hard if you looks so good😂 you can have them all😅😅
This song is insane 😮
I hope oneday that this video does reach a hundred million views as it deserves it. Masterpiece both musically and visually.
FUCK a love like Romeo and Juliet or morticia and Gomez. THIS is the love right here❤ y’all are PERFECT together like, just perfect
2:10
100% meant to be a ballad.
Omg 😳 I’ve never seen/heard such … terribleness…wow you are really good at setting scenes of violence . SMDH that’s not art. That’s a sad poo game.
🎉
Love this song- it should have gotten a VMA award!! Maybe a Grammy!!❤
*sighs* Can’t talk now kids, Mommy has to be emo again 🖤
Ronnie looking pretty af in this.
Ohh my god
This guy doesn't make music videos. He makes entire motion pictures with a non-stop soundtrack.
Save the Drama for your Moma lolz
magnifique .....
Твой голос - это нечто!
Salute
This masterpiece is underrated.. 😭😭
Epic!
Paige is very beautiful and very sexy attractive and hot
who want's to make a band called getting up? Because i'm about it
That's so sad... Almost as sad as realizing what Chester was singing about years after when it was too late.
Amazed this doesn't have more likes, this is a masterpiece!!
These remakes of these songs are so fucking powerful and hit a different emotional level they have me in tears. I love them so much. This, the drug in me is reimagined, and last resort are 3 of the most incredible pieces of music I’ve ever listened to
Still better love story then Twilight
1:32 "I can feel it in my balls"
Es lo más increible que he escuchado jamás!!!
Prefer this style if only he pull it off for every song
how come this emo pop song came into the light ? who listens to this shit ? apparently 18m people ..
reminds me a lot to the rasmus
3:23-3:36 and 4:57-6:03 these parts gave me goosebumps

A literal masterpiece
ronnie vc é gemeo do mc daniel ?
Falling in love with FIR 14 years ago when they were just a little band playing around LA, and now are headlining Louder Than Life in 2024.....proud is an understatement.   P.S. This revamp still gives me chills.
His voice is so Incredible 🥰

That’s how it’s supposed to be sung
i fell in love with this song
este es el mejor tema de todo Youtube el segundo video clip de todo !!! YouTube !!!!
July 2024   Damn, How long, no?
This was the most angelic noise I’ve ever heard, and the violins DID YAW HEAR THE VIOLINS!!!!!!
Love the eyeliner❤ and him
It irritates me that alot af BS songs has thousand millions of views and this masterpiece has only 18 million, love Ronnie and Falling In Rivers ❤❤❤
My mommy loves this song because she likes vampires
😍😍😍😍🔥🚀🤯🫶🏻🇦🇷
Anyone 2024
Uuffff this versión Is awesome🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️
Grabs the eye liner and Gothic attire and is like okay I'm fuckin ready let's go ronnie
I never thought I’d get the privilege of seeing Ronnie as a vampire 🥵
Never ever getting over this damnnn songgggg, this stays with me as long as I'm aliveeee❤️‍🔥💓🤌
Anyone in 2033?
I keep finding my account unsubscribed somehow. Third time this week I had to re-sub
молодец не сдался
прикольно
Ronnie Radke is purely perfect, and a god damn masterpiece of a human being!!!!!!
insane
Why this only have 18M views is unbelievable,it deserves way more
i love him he can sing anyways he wants soft and then loud
2024year
Standing ovation 👏
I love this version. Awesome!
How are both versions bangers 🤯
This song - this particular version - just hits. The vocals are amazing, and I'm loving the Interview with the Vampire vibes <3
Only white girls who have no musical talent listen to falling in reverse not for the music either only so they can play with their little button whenever they see ronnie
This could also be some kind of makeup commercial for tattoo covering...
Masterpiece
The range on this man. Limitless. I want an entire Opera.
I fcking love this.
If home is where the heart is then my heart has lost all hope.  Genius!!! That easily wraps it all up in a f$;/;);! nutshell for those that were cast aside, neglected or abandon as a child.  It is def bad place to be and disturbingly difficult to live through and recreate yourself. Love how Ronnie then runs to a deserted place alone to eventually return to society to face his confessed sick condition. Only to be tormented more.  that must be those people that badmouth him on TikTok.  lol.  Brilliant song. Thank God now… he is a Phoenix in his home now. 🦜 ❤ 🦜 ❤
This song is unreal. No matter how many times I hear it, I ALWAYS get goosebumps. The hair on my arms stands straight up. Ronnie, I have no words save FUCKING EPIC
This is what happens the absolute second a mf finds out about castlevania
Man, you still here?!?! Of course we ARE Still HERE IN 2024
had to listen again to the original cause I just forgot what it sounded like after listening to this.
This dude is unreal! Is there anything he can't sing!
His voice. Yummy isn’t descriptive enough.
Holy shit, these vocals... i have NEVER heard such a range of styles sung so well by one person. O___O
Saraya was amazing Go bestie❤
MGP 2025 winner
I'm a death metal guy here cause a cute boi told me this song meant a lot to him. I appreciate the hard work that went into this. cheers
I hate to say it. You're no Meatloaf.  You're  mfing Ronnie Radke.  Awesome music. 👏
@1:03 She looks like a goose.
The Greybeards and Vampire Dragonborn rockin
So beautiful ❤️
this is the better version
Why am I crying over thie fabricated romeo & juliet MV?
I prefer  this version  the visuals  actuality  are better than  a mental facility  just fits more
gorgeous🥰
I mean I knew he had range... But shit I didn't know he had this much range! Good show Ronnie
Omg 😮
my god...
Beautifully done 🤙you guys just keep making masterpeice after masterpiece ! definitely my favourite band by far such raw talent. This song gives me goosebumps everytime i hear it
Malgré son obscure passé...  Ce mec est un génie...  Il mérite une seconde chance..  La musique est un moyen d'extérioriser ses démons 😈😈😈 Je pense qu'il se bat contre lui même...  Chez nous,  on a Bertrand Cantat,  "Noir Désir"...  Peux plus l'encadrer et même si c'était un super groupe, j'avoue,  ils ne m'ont jamais vraiment touché,  pas fan...  Mais pour moi,  il n'a pas tué qu'une femme,  Marie Trintignant,  mais 2 !!!!!  Car la mère de ses enfants,  qui a assisté à son procès,  s'est suicidée.. 😭 C'est qu'elle avait gros sur la patate... 😭😭
I love his voice ❤ Ronnie can sing anything. 🤘🏼
Welp, guess we're back to heavy eyeliner and ripped skinny jeans at 35. Digging out the black hair dye jar from manic panic as we speak. Time to prove to mom it wasn't just a phase. See you all at the concert.
This is magic lol
What the actual fuck…. I thought the original was an amazing but this..? THIS! Was a majestically journey of a masterpiece
Did y'all hear how he said "I feel like a lady that's pregnant with a baby" 😂
🎉
До слёз...
2024
FIR + NF = A MUCH NEEDED MASTERPIECE
This song hits so hard in this version. I love it!!
2024 still listening to this masterpiece!
I think Ronnie is one of the best male singers in my life time. Like this man can do it all. He sings with such passion and emotion you could even hear it when he raps. Its crazy good and I'll never get tired of this mans talent.
I adore Ronnie but i like the first versión more because the motion and energy

"i'm not a vampire (revamped)"  well, i'm not a vampire, but i feel like one sometimes i sleep all day 'cause i hate the sunlight my hands are always shaking body's always aching, and the dark is when i feed well, i can lure any woman that i want to in my bed with me  and whiskey seems to be my holy water and mothers, better lock your doors and hide your daughters  'cause i'm insane, i can feel it in my bones coursing through my veins, when did i become so cold? for goodness sakes, where is my self-control? if home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all hope  well, i'm not a zombie, but i feel like one today self-induced comatose, chemical daze my head is always spinning from this dizzy blurry vision and my stomach has had enough i feel like a lady that is pregnant with a baby 'cause i'm always throwing up  and hi, my name is ronnie, i'm an addict and daddy should've never raised me on black sabbath  i'm insane, i can feel it in my bones coursing through my veins, when did i become so cold? for goodness sakes, where is my self-control? if home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all hope  when will you mortals believe?

Es una increíble canción tiene una voz tan perfecta para el tipo de canción y el instrumental que le puso falling in reverse la mejor banda ❤
perfeiçao
It's like the grown up serious version of the Dracula song from Forgetting Sarah Marshall lol
Dude Ronnie you are like the coolest guy I've ever well. I can't go there but one of the coolest guys I ever met. I haven't met you. Just saying that I ever seen you are my muse my inspiration 💕❤️
Bu ne 💩 tan bir  🧛🏻 şarkısı
fucking masterpiece!!!!!! ❤
So he was a vampire all this time? 😮
omg my bf introduced me to this band and also this song, truly a masterpiece 💖
One of those gems of a song that does not nearly feel as long as it actually is. Instant classic.
RONNIE IS A GOD
Ronnie maybe an asshole BUT THE MANS A MUSICAL GENIUS 🤘🏽🖤 OUR BIG MEAN BLEGH DADDY
“And whiskey seems to be my holy water” as a recovering alcoholic that line hits so hard 😢
Song is to long
amooo
Самый лучший скрипач на  СВЕТЕ. ВЫ САМЫЙ МУЗЫКАНТ  ЛУЧШИЙ. СПАСИБО ВАМ  БОЛЬШОЕ  ЗА ВСЕ . ВЫ ЛУЧШИЙ ВО ВСЕМ МИРЕ !!!!!!

With this video, to popular monster, to voices in my head, to watch the world burn, to Ronald.  Am I missing any in this Swan Song of music videos?
Ok, now, I'm crying.
Man.. this is beautiful
Just got my best friend into falling in reverse, an now her 6 year old goes around the house screaming "hi my name is ronnie, I'm a medic" 😂 we let the wrong lyrics slide because he's #ronniesyoungestfan ❤
I would love to hear this live🖤
Drain our life's blood. We'll thank you because we can also taste your blood...
Is it me or does the vampire lore in this follow closely Interview with a Vampire from the 90's?
𝘙𝘰𝘯𝘯𝘪𝘦 𝘺𝘰𝘶 𝘢𝘣𝘴𝘰𝘭𝘶𝘵𝘦 𝘭𝘦𝘨𝘦𝘯𝘥 ❤
Hell yeah
Fucking beautiful. Chefs kiss
If it were a soccer World Cup, this video would win the cup.
2024 im still listening new version  and the old version 12 year ago
Girl he looks so dissapointed you don't know how to clean that blood up. Stop just mopping it around 🙄
Hi
Wow I love this song
I only discovered FiR this year and I honestly believe Ronnie is one of the most talented performers I have seen in a long time! He can sing, rap, shout and blast out a full on guttural roar! Much love from a GenX Gadgie 🤘🏻🤘🏻

This song and the characters reminds me of the movie dark shadows one of my favorite vampire movies
😍
One of his songs off of TikTok brings me to listening to his songs. Love it love how so epic his songs are to listen and to watch
This is a masterpiece ❤️
y love you
Все пытался понять, почему Ронни тут так хорошо выглядит. И лишь сейчас понял. Ему замазали все портаки.
revampired
this needs to be in avengers movie fr. this is like a Iron man redemption arc theme song
I LOVE YOU
Morb out of 10
Me encantó, amé esta versión. Y el video es una película totalmente. El único capaz de lograr que una misma canción suene de diferentes maneras y llegue de manera diferente a nosotros  ❤❤❤
Luv this song ❤❤❤❤
Im emo
This is the rendition of a song I didnt know I needed ❤
OMG PAIGE IS THAT YOU HUHUHU
So happy I got to go to his concert 😍 💓
Love him🥰the greatest song, thank you, Maestro 🤗
He trembles me. ❤
Used to hate on falling in reverse and their old music really isn't my thing but damn this is incredible
THIS REMINDS ME OF THAT ONE TIME THAT JAMES IN POKEMON RAN AWAY,,, PRETTY DRAMATIC BUT HIT HARD.
Still one of my favorite songs ever 💪🏽☺️ absolute MASTERPIECE 💯
Anyone here? April 2024 😍
Сатанисты!
I aspire to be this level of dramatic 😂😂😂😂
what happened
my song
Someone had the brilliant idea of putting intensely dramatic music and vocals, and elegant visuals, to a song that sounds like it was written by an angsty teen.
When the choir in monk robes started singing "HE'S NOT A VAMPIRE" intercut with him draining somebody's blood i just lost it
Soooooo goooooood excellent I love this.
Yea this is Gold..im 60... old school head banger.. this is soo dam awesome. Ronnie's voice gives me chills too..Love this
Got those Edward Scissorhands vibes going, someone needs to get Tim Burton to make this into a film. Ronnie Radke is a TRUE legend👌👌👌
Am I the only one that likes this version better than the first? It just works better for his voice the way he's singing in this one
Why did you left Yandex Music?
Nah, I’m in Tallin right now.  It’s pronounced taa-luhn sounds like a a birds “Talon” 🦅
the choir and instrumentals were really nice but god are those lyrics awful :D and its not because i find the topic cringe i dont care about emo or vampire stuff, but its so forced (wants to bring a message/story across) that its barely even "singable".
Нет преступления страшнее, чем дать вечную жизнь самоубийце.
Bro why did I almost cry listening to this 😳 the heck
This whole song is a masterpiece, it has so much emotion behind it and the filmmaking is amazing as well
this is one of my favorite music videos ever
I need to share my feelings.
Manaus AM
🖤🖤🖤
He kinda giving me Cazador Szarr vibes, if Cazador felt remorse
Incrível
Amazing song. Ronnie is brilliant. Just one question, what happened to the Paige on the couch?? It was not the same as Paige as the ghost/entity? They were not even dressed the same. Did she survive to cause havoc another day?
2024!! 🤘🏻
Revamped or reimagined.  ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Ronnie, tu es excellent dans cet opéra rock. Tu peux tout chanté. On comprend mieux la puissance du texte dans cet version. Depuis que je l'ai découverte, j'arrête pas de l'écouter 🤘
Brittany Renee Perdue: I need tickets!!!
Damn Paige and Ronnie really look good here if it was a short movie id watch it
The best music video and the song I've ever seen and heard in my life.
I want to watch this whole movie! Giving me Interview with a Vampire and Van Helsing vibes! The good old vampire stuff
Ronnie knows how to make a old song of falling in reverse in a hit again its insane
What a plot twist. He really is a vampire?! Also, Falling in Revers should do more of these.
Better than the original
Hi, my name is Richard. I'm an addict.
Love love love          VvvV
Mc Daniel tá inspirado nessa música kkkk
mano isso ta INCRÍVEL
knowing she went with him is romantic. I love his voice.
Imagine if Ronnie "Reimagined" Bille Jean for Michael Jackson
My top 3 fav FIR  songs  -3 Zombified   -2 Popular monster   -1 I'm not a vampire (revamped)
This is better than the phantom of the Opera
I see Saraya Jade is in this video. FKA Paige (WWE fame). Fuckin' Cool ass video.
wow i loved this a lot. sexy vampire sexy woo woo yea oh yea i want a vampire sexy guy to bit me plsssss
vai tocar no meu casamento
Should be Astarion's song BG3
5:19 5:22 5:25 5:27 5:29 5:30 5:30 5:31 5:31 5:32  sounds so familiar, like take me home country roads
Plot twist is you actually…ARE 🐺❤️
Ronnie is the final boss after you defeated all the emo and alternative bands
I loved this song as a middle schooler and now being an adult and clean it hits even harder
Bodies bodies bodies
Aren't all his videos like mini movies the cinematography is awesome
F gj[jle
Dude has some pipes damn .
Whos dat girl? Name pls 🫠
It's amazing how every reimagined song makes you realize the lyrics true meaning. It's like "oh fun rock/metal song to headbang to." Then like this it's "ohhh fuck. I actually relate to this."
Please do another song like this! So much fucking passion!
I just want to come home 🌒🐺🗽
I’m not an addict, I just came in here lookin’ for some friends
Ronnie Radke: Thats Why They Called Me King Of Music Scene. 😁
Deamn.
HOW DOES HE NOT AGE

Beer is my holy water...this is an absolute masterpiece.. what an amazing love story..Ronnie will go down in history as one of the most amazing singers.
🎉
Ronnie is everything that narcissistic loser Richie/Social Repose thought he could be. The difference is pure raw talent, and passionate empthy ❤
ive been listening to you since 2013
Wooowwwww. That was like a full blown film. Incredible.
After years this song is still perfect in every way
Bro why are they saying that song for only boys??
4:55🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🧛‍♂️❤🧛‍♀️
unbelievable...still find no words...love it
I hope Ronnie never will lose all hope and will not lose in the fight against his demons.🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
It's not a meme. We don't like Ian.   Get ianoff the show. 10 year viewer here.
Why does he know he know so much about me but my name is different?
I listened a few songs by this band for the first time today. And you know what? It changed absolutely nothing in my life😄I thought it's a metal band, but I guess they changed their style from rock to rap. Ok. No complaints here - their choice.  I don't like this song (both versions) and the vocals are nothing special. Didn't dig in the lyrics, so won't speak about it. But quality of the video is awesome! It's almost a movie. By the way, he looks much better without all those tattoos. Well, at least now I know what kind of band they are.
HOW DOES HE NOT HAVE A GRAMMY YET???? WTF!????? A true musical genius.
Re *_vamp_* ed ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° )
• WOW • I stumbled on this while randomly scrolling thru music. I am so glad I did.  I am just now discovering this artist at 39 years old.....wtf.
emo
Any other empaths just out here crying to this version?
i love this guy so much !
Perfection
Such a Beautiful Masterpiece.
WHATS THE PASSWORD RONNIE?! LOL ❤❤❤
If you want a depressing song then here you go 📜👈 🤷🏼‍♂️😺🤠
When he heals the girl with his blood you know they be drawing inspiration from the vampire diaries
i cant believe how much I love ronnie's production team with all this AMAZING Filming
Saraya is an angel 😘🖤🖤
beter every time
Got to see them perform the original live last week. Ronnie is as amazing on the stage
Ronnie Wyld 4 this 1
My favourite song from you 🎵🎶=)
Hell yeah. 🖤🤘🏻
He forgot to tell her sun aint good.
Вкомандировку НА пост)
Ronnie is just incredible. And ppl waste their time bitching about him. The man is so talented
Fucking Masterpiece.  I've been slowly unlearning my rock/metal snobbery that was absorbed from my forebears.  I was taught that these types of vocals automatically made the music "gay."  Some of their other songs still have shitty vocals, though.  I want to give everything that I missed out on another chance.  Hell, I've even started listening to Bullet for my Valentine to see if I like anything.
My.....GOD
2 years later and I just noticed that the girl is Saraya
It is a damn fucking masterpiece
Best music video I've seen in years!!!
Damn those screams ......when you thought you heard everything.
Holy 🤯 I fell in love again. Didn't think I could go deeper...love how he always surprises me. That damn voice ❤
goosebumps
G-d damm dude 😢.
What the hell this song 👏👏👏🙌🙌🙌😮😮😮
I’m still not over this
I’m SPEECHLESS ❤❤❤
This is just Rumplestiltskin and Belle from Once Upon A Time in a different realm!

That so beautiful thanks for this privilege
Holy shit. This is amazing. I'm just discovering this now. Made me cry.
Ronnie B Wylînnnnn’
My heart has lost all hope❤
This is good rock music these days!!! Lazy lyrics and sounds like everything else at the moment!!!
Damn. After being a fan for years I just got around to watching this and holy shit this is more emo than the original
This is a Masterpiece. The best best part for me starts at 3:00 to ending. My heart started stomping. I feel all the words he let go straight to my heart. I feel like crying. What a masterpiece.  Plus the music video, is it music video?  feel like watching a movie Opera. He have amazing voice. When he started screaming for some reason my heart is breaking. ❤❤
Dracula's Lament (Dracula musical) by @JasonSegal #tasteoflove #diediedie #Icant  *its been 3 months and no one laughed at my Forgetting Sarah Marshall reference  😅
Brother I’ve been here for many years listening to your fucking beautiful art. The gods are not allowed to take you!
La musique, le clip. Tout est simplement magnifique. En voiture, j’écoute la chanson sur mon téléphone. J’ai écouté la chanson je ne sais pas combien de fois, mais à chaque écoute j’en ai la chair de poule. Que dire de plus que J’ADORE. Un grand BRAVO.😊

What a beautiful masterpiece!
Look like the mansion from elliot minor : still figuring it out
Am I the only one who wants a movie with Ronnie? 😢
This is one of those songs that works as long as you don't actually pay close attention to the lyrics.
this is absolutely amazing
Voice is so beautiful....
Nah your okay Ronnie.  Just worry bout you and dont hurt no one else. Your not crazy , the ones that tell you that are the ones with mental problems.
Hey vampires!  I'm just saying that sunlight also comes from the moon.😂😂
The video and the songs makes me feel like a vampire even that i know i'm not
I like this version more than the rock one
back after 2 years rediscovering this song and it still gives me goosebumps. I firmly believe that this is and will always be Ronnie's best song ever. I wish he'd perform it live sobbb
I.. I just wanna cover this song like GOSH THIS SONG WHY AM I LISTENING TO IT ONLY NOW??! ❤🥀
Gonna tell my kids this is meatloaf
Revamped, lol
this guy is a effin goat
I keep coming back to this song, there are no words for how fucking great this song is! When im feeling down, this song really gives me a boost! A masterpiece!
Uma obra de arte! Um verdadeiro Toreador ❤️🖤
I'm crying 💔🤧🤧😞😢😢😢
This reminds me of the Nine Inch Nails Perfect Drug video.
🖤
“Whiskey seems to be my holy water” facts Ronnie facts
No entiendo porque se deja matar de seguro tenía muchas habilidades
Okay I think I'm crazy but hear me out. I was (still am) a bit sick for a dew days.  * sometimes I sleep all day because I hate the sunlight (yesterday I woke up and the whole day my eyes hurt cause of the light) * my hands are always shaking (last few days yes) * body's always aching (yes)  * and the dark is when I feed (I have not been hungry for the last two weeks) * when did I become so cold (my hands are literally always cold) * my head is always spinning from this dizzy blurry vision (headache for the last few days and dizziness) *my stomach has had enough (yup) * I feel like a lady that is pregnant with a baby cause I'm always throwing up (no but I felt nauseous last couple of weeks)   Am I wrong or are these signs that I'm becoming a vampire??   😂😂😂
Wow!!!bravo!!!❤❤❤❤
We here you.we have to get life back he got it. Love to talk to him.😊
Безумно красиво поёт!!!!❤🎉

Singing along chokes me up hard. Not that I can sing like Ronnie, but just mouthing the words makes me all emo kid again. Weird feels.
Может кто сделать перевод ?
Amo demais essa música. Uma perfeição! ❤
all i can is wow
It gives me those Meatloaf Anything For Love vibes...
FUCK!!!!!!! It pisses me off how fucking good this is!!!!!like every single aspect of this song is so well thought out and executed perfectly!
this is a better story than twilight
To people who read the comment about Ronnie writting musical about FIR  Do you know the history? Hands up
What I always loved about this version: Now, he really sounds like a vampire that hates the sun. Fits the vibe much more than the original version o.O
I wish I could go back to seeing this for the first time ever
He's mega talented. Absolutely love this, and Saraya from my home town - love her!
This mv is really awesome! Ronnie & Saraya, please make the long version movie for this, cause I would love to watch it for sure! ❤
I think my contribution to the views on this video is stalker certifiable. Just cannot get enough of the "Re-imagined" tracks!!
Who's that beautiful goddess in the white night gown
mega god!
Keep making music. Or else you know what boyo. he he he.
Interview with a vampire vibes and I love
It's like he had 2004 cradle of filth break downs for like half a second then went straight to soft
Save some mortal blood for the rest of us ❤
He's so freaking talented. Not sure what he can't do musically.
che pero esta mal el titulo de la canción, si es un vampiro el chabon, borren bots
Это, просто, о..енно!
This is my version of Romeo and Juliet
His Voice and the Piano are the best 1. 2 . PUNCH BREATH TAKING 😮😅😮❤😮😊❤😅
I would thoroughly enjoy a rock opera from Ronnie…I cannot express how much I enjoy this song.
2 years now and i steal get goosebumps
Im waiting for him to drop a Country/Rap/Metal single. 😆
Yo is that Paige?
That crescendo........ 🥶
!!Rock and metal radio station. Google it: "shogun rocks laut"  Have fun!!
Ronnie is so very talented! Multi-talented, if you will...❤🔥
This is the best song remake ever!
Original for workouts  Revamped to feel
To my end of her...shes mine...shes the beginning
amazing
Che capolavoro!!🥺😍😍🖤🦇
This version is way better then the original
Im in love with this version oc this song
No sabia que existia esta joyita 😮🖤
I love this! its a masterpiece and i love how Saraya his partner in real life is in this video. He loves her so much. I wish i had a love like they both do with each other.
here agaain
Damn, that ending is deep as hell. He brought her back to life, and she died with them. That’s insane never even watch that fully all the way through. I’ve listened, but I just got deep into the video lol. Ronnie the goat.
eu te amo Ronnie
It's not the same without the "HI RONNIE :D"
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I love It so much🥺🦇🖤🦇🖤🦇🖤
❤️‍🔥Spectacular ❤️‍🔥❣️❣️
For someone who is clearly not a vampire, he doth protest a little too much. Also maybe don't dress in a tailcoat and a frilly blouse...no no..just saying. You do you. Epic track though - glad I found it. It's on heavy rotation. The vocals/music are insane - I'm glad musical talent is not completly dead...maybe it's just...undead.
❤❤❤❤❤❤
What a fucking wonder❤
This fucking guy is the reason I started listening to metal again.
This voice is so fucking incredible 😳🥰😍
Wolf wolf 🐺 Manny money Gonzalez just saying I'm not a vampire 🦇🤑🤑😜🇨🇺🇺🇸♈👺👑🤷🏻🤷🏻😎🎧🎛️🎚️🔈🔉🔉🎼🎶🎵🎼🎵🎵🎵🎵🎵🎵🎵⚰️🪦⚰️⚰️⚰️

If anyone is watching this nowadays PLEASE explain to me what was going on with Saraya😭. I understand everything in this music video but I have no idea what was wrong with her and what she was doing.
The talent this man has is amazing
These remakes that Ronnie has done are absolutely stunning and give him the opportunity to just show the raw emotion behind the music that it deserves.
I discovered this group about 6 months ago (uk 🇬🇧 ) Amazing voice and the songs are boss ❤❤❤ this group 🎉

For goodness' sakes Where is my self control?

This is f**king incredible! I swear the 1st time I saw this video, I was squawling like a baby by the end! Ronnie Radke is a GENIUS! His combination of rock, rap, and classical music, along with lyrics about battling mental illness helps me through my pain and darkness every day.
No me canso de escuchar y ver el video es simplemente monumental
feel it so much
He 's a freaking genius lyrically, and all the videos are insane. Let's be real if you have bad shit to say you are just fucking jealous.
Fuck me in a biscuit...What a song.
Old one was way better sorry
Does it exist on vinyl?🤔
🖤
Really amazing voice acting!!! Enjoyed every bit of it!!! Keep the good work up 🖤
Absolutely brilliant!
Never knew there was a video to this! Just makes it even better. Ronnie can definitely Music.
Excuse me sir but um, can you scream into the microphone we don't care what you say just  scream.
Ronnie’s aging backwards 😩
❤❤
It's been 2 years, listening almost every day and still crying over this fucking masterpiece.
Je n'ai pas de mots assez fort. Cette version a touché mon âme en plein cœur
i knew it was gonna be like this lmao i even sung the intro almost jus like him all revamps have this kinda flow to it like a love song or sum like that sorry dont know the genre im not a music buff but this has its own twist to it and its dope asf... (EDIT)  shows u how little i listen to this band but there was gonna be a band i was gonna mention that did a revamp of a song 10+ years ago (Drug in Me is You) but its the same band but there are many old bands like AA, BMTH, BVB, BFMV + more that are doing revamps or reimagined old songs and sum are bangers.... 2nd Edit, tbh Ronnie needs to be in a Harry Potter film dude can play a young Severus Snape lmao
Ronnie radke x noah sebastian have same voices
hahahah stop 😂
Amazing.. but the original will always be nostalgia
He looks like a vampire without the makeup 😂😂😂
holy fucking shit
Still like the original better but damn this is fire

Ten Thousend Likes In The Air
Интересный исполнитель. Очень нравится  у него сочетание разных жанров! А эта песня прекрасна - клип, музыка и эмоциональное исполнение!
Such a talented artist. Almost takes me back to Type O Negative and the dark romanticism that made me love vampires to begin with.
Sht is demonic
This song and zombiefied made me a fan of the band, I never liked hardcore, but Ronnie made it perfect with a horror and gothic theme I love it. I've never seen anyone combine so many genres and look perfect I like all of this, I love horror, gothic and rap & Superheros.
Come back to kc asap! This  dope. Im oldschool metal. But this is fkn dope
It is so beautifully chilling I love this song 🎵 ❤
This is so trash! Y’all must be deaf
Ronnie Radke could make for one helluva stage singer! Broadway even!  Also, i can easily see him as a nobleman. He does it so well in this re-vamped version of I'm Not A Vampire!
1:50 - 1:59 GAVE ME CHILLSSSSSS especially 1:54
although it does have it's goofy moments (as all vampire content should) the song is so extravagant and it's perfectly does the lyrics justice, they hold so much more weight in this version. i absolutely love this version and it has 'revamped' my love of falling in reverse
reading what happened with Derek and Christina and watching this, my heart is tearing apart </3 Such a lovely dedication to them and so brilliantly performed. t's impossible to not feel the pain and emotion coming through in this version of the song
I love this song, the revision is a masterpiece & Saraya fits Ronnie so well.
To this day I can't describe how much I love this song when I used to listen to it when I was younger and now since there is a revamped, It freaking sounds awesome. ❤️  I ❤️ Ronnie Radke
2 years and it still gives me goosebumps 😍
Amazing
Now that I’ve heard this version, the other version feels wrong. Am I the only one? Like I appreciate the other for what it is, but it feels like this song was MEANT to be this way.
Ich wish that he will make epic-metal-opera-musical-movies some day

Viciante demais mds, parece um filme, como só vi hoje?
This man sings Like An Angel but he is a God!
I've been listening to Ronnie since start of ETF and even now with FIR and all this new sound. My view on him has definatly changed for the better over the years
This song will be the start of my villain arc song
This keeps being one of my favorite songs. Thank you so so so much for creating this masterpiece

“I just want the world to bleed “.
Incredible voice, videos and music... and damn he's hot!! ❤
HOLY SHITTTTTTTTTT <3
will he ever perform this version in concert??
Ronnie is...I-Just WOW. I love how he looks like a stereotypical vampire
Wow 😮 my fav song
Now I have to write Ronnie as  a character in my story.
Black sabbath to BlAcK SABBY
I think that is his actual wife in this video. If not she looks a lot like her.
🥰🥰🥰
A genuine masterpiece.
Wow amazing 😮 beautyful song. now you have a New Fan. I like the variety and the mixing of different styles in your other songs.  great work.😮
It's is a masterpiece in a sense, but the music is a little ADHD-y, kinda like himself, all over the place.
Это самое охуетительное творение которое я слышал за последнее время, он долбаный гений
This is actually really beautiful.
Почему же ведьма не сделала вам дневные кольца???! 😢😮
His scream gives me goosebumps! This song is amazing like this, I seriously feel tears welling up from the emotion everytime I play it!
Ronnie is incredible the way he performs what he sings. You instantly form an attachment to the character he's portraying. You feel every word he sings. I wish the band could come to the UK. I bet they are beyond words live 🖤
Ou seja, não adiantou nada ele se entregar pra salvar ela kkkk
Hi my name is Ronnie, I'm an addict... same same fml.
This song is to amazing to get awarded ❤
I see... apparently it really wasnt just a phase. Just needed more music 😂
salve
I love that his girlfriend played in this as well. 🖤 I love this version
Is the second picture the sheriff flashes Bram Stoker??
This version is by far the best!
Banger 👍

I am the truth of the walking dead the truth of Anne frank and the march of tears that lead Judgement day! That is what my vampirism is. - Ronnie Lunch With Jeff 541 Jeffrey Wooten and Anne Frank  The curse of Adam is Lilith Eve Welcome to Hell mouth
Pianist, Singer, mysic producer, and overall artist. Truly impressed by him.
Ronnie should make all his songs with only his clean voice. He is creating a totally new and magnificent style.
He makes such great videos for his songs, it's just phenomenal. It's rare that I like all the videos from an artist, that's the case with Ronnie. Very good work 🖤🤘🎧
This wrecked me. 😢😢
This was such a work of art. Ronnie had turned from a good singer into a fantastic and talented singer throughout this past decade. Everything about this was a masterpiece
Chills whooaah
Wtf is this? Didn't know the band... that just blew me away
Pior momento ❤ouvindo
I like this video. Girl is pretty but looks older than Ronnie. Where are his fu*ing tatooes?
Holy shit this is magical
WOW!  FUll nody goosebumps...haunting and beautiful!

Long life you men!!!(Russia)❤
The level of emotion put into this interpretation is insane!
So, we not gonna talk about a vampire drinking alcohol and getting "Drunk"? lol
I feel like the song went from being Green Day style to Within Temptation, and watching Interview with a vampire in 6 minutes... absolutely shaken and goosebumps everywhere 😧
I thought the drug in me is reimagined was the only one! Awesome!
I Absolutely LOVE THIS video & Ronnie! ❤
This man is a musical genius. Can't believe I hated this guy for so long...
The way he says I'M A VAMPIRE reminds me of Nic Cage
So emotional, I nearly shed a tear. That is all I have to say
Saraya/Paige <3
This is giving ‘phantom of the opera’ idk why
Amazing performance, I even shed a tear ... The clip is also good, the plot and presentation, bravo!
AWESSSOOOOOOOOOMEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!
That’s awesome Paige from AEW is in here
And now i'm picturing Him as Lestat in a queen of the damned remake.

I hope you do this to some of your other songs as well, absolutely beautiful. ❤

Well, I'm not a vampire But I feel like one Sometimes I sleep all day Because I hate the sunlight My hands are always shaking Body's always aching And the dark is when I feed Well, I can lure any woman that I want to in my bed With me And whiskey seems to be my holy water Mothers better lock your doors And hide your daughters I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness' sakes Where is my self control? If home is where my heart is Then my heart has lost all hope Well, I'm not a zombie But I feel like one today Self-induced comatose, chemical daze My head is always spinning From this dizzy, blurry vision And my stomach has had enough I feel like a lady That is pregnant with a baby 'Cause I'm always throwing up Hi, my name is Ronnie I'm an addict (Hi, Ronnie) Daddy should've never raised me on Black Sabbath I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness' sakes Where is my self control? If home is where my heart is Then my heart has lost all hope God bless all of you now 'Cause I'm going straight to hell And I'm taking you down with me 'Cause you know damn well I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness' sakes Where is my self control? If home is where my heart is Then my heart has lost all hope All hope All hope
Это великолепно!
I was never a big fan of FIR's early work. But the latest stuff.....Jeebus!  IT IS AMAZING!  And dont even get me started on the videos.  Blown away......Wow!
Back again for the millionth time to enjoy this cinematic masterpiece
At this point he is just showing off xD what a genius!
youtube algorithm working for once🙏🙏
His vocal range will never cease to amaze me. I love Ronnie so much.
aaaaa I literally fell in love in this song and his beautiful shots in every angle  he really look handsome with that long curly hair just like a real Vampire. this song reminds of me the novel I read long time ago. I really like Dark Fantasy this song is sooo F perfect 💀☕ I can listen to this everyday while reading. 100/10
I am pretty sure that is his wife
I wonder if he even reads these comments...
What's wrong with murdering people? Nothing when youre not miss America or a princess. I'm rich but not some princess. I was born in TN. I don't have to give a fuck about Spain.
THIS fucking art piece. WOW.... yup. the fuck else is to be said. words other than his lyrics fail.
i feel like there really isnt any people who truly understand the story and metpahor for this video
Ronnie will probably never read this. But I take great inspiration from you ❤️
holy fuck this guys a fckinnnnn god
can saraya and ronnie have an oscar on there acting please??
Captions: [Music]  oh thank you, i hadn't noticed.:| Incredible everything, i love this
Finally we had Blade 4 trailer.
i can't get out of here, goooooooooooosh
Paige and Ronnie ❤❤❤
Solid stuff
God Bless TikTok for putting me onto this! 🙏 and Paige as a cameo too! Winning
I'm crying, this was an emotional experience  😭
Heh reVAMPed
Flat out... what in the fuck did I just watch, and why is it so amazing?
Amazing story told
Epic <3
Loved Falling in Reverse.  This though... far more technical and precise on so many different levels.  Had no idea Ronnie had such command and control with his vocals.  Goose bumps.  Every. Listen.  I'll take every disbeliever because -I- know damn well. The production is great too.  I've just been listening first and watching second.
"Paige here!"
🖤🖤🖤💋🖤🖤🖤
This is pretty cheesy I like it and hate it at the same time 😂
They could make a South Park episode of this song bring back the vamps Goths and Emos on South Park 😂
I absolutely love this long. And for the first time the lyrics are hitting home for me. You were amazing singing this song. I first discovered this video on Facebook. But today was the first time I actually got to hear the whole song. I love how song this song. I’m looking forward to hearing more songs like this by you.
Eh.
Thi's it's the Balance ☯️
My theme song!! Love 💔🖤❤️‍🔥
Holy!
Like both versions!!
This is such a masterpiece 🥲🥲. This band is fucking legendary. Ronnie is legendary. Resonate so much with the battles he’s gone through and the things he’s seen.
Heard he's canceled multiple shows
Powerful music 👍
Replace “vampire/zombie” with “addict/alcoholic” and this song makes so much sense and is so powerful.
She is paige 🤔
I'd never heard of Falling In Reverse before today and, OMFG, I've been missing out! Seen several vids in a row and I'm sold. I'm a fan from here on. 👌🏼💜
Interesting, but the video is a drawboard of sorts: it's too dramatic; the music can't quite carry it, so it's being overshadowed by all the all the gregorian quire on a mountain top of busty woman in corset and stuff.   Nice burning alive effect, though!
A 'Vampire: The Masquerade Story', staring Leslie Nielsen in... "Dead and Kinda Not Loving it this Time."... starring Leslie Nielsen.
this is a fucking masterpiece. literal tears.
whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa X.X x:XX.X IM A VAMPIRE MOTHERFUCKER AAAAAAAA
❤❤❤❤❤
Beautiful
that was FUCKING AMAZING
masterpiece dude.
Lol ronnie makes the perfect vampire love the hair haha
I am 100% convinced that there isn't a single aspect of musical artistry that Ronnie can not reach. He is a legend, and he is his own genre at this point. 🔥
Jesus this is underrated

Believe it or not 57 yr old new fan. Amazing music
Such a great vocalist. Ronnie can sing in any way..one of the best in todays music world
I eant a dio ai
Ron is the best vocalist! Hands down!
It's tragically beautiful my soul has been touched
Крутая социальная драма про вампиров!)  Полагаю нужно больше контента уделять их проблемам!! Они ведь тоже люди 🤗💕🌹
WOW 🤩
From now on when people ask me what depression feels like... I'll just show them this video. It captures the emotions, pain, hopelessness,  crying for help and complete breakdown that happens in your head... and the constant reconstruction of yourself on a daily basis to move on day to day. AMAZING!!!
Ronnie, Ronnie, Ronnie! Such the drama diva! If though truly is a vampire, you should seek out the Dark Mother-She can help. Just FYI/411.💋💯😺💋
Give us this musical (not-a-)vampire movie with this cast now, please!
Any one else pick up a "Meatloaf" vibe from this video just a grown emo kid loving the music though
So hm, the instrumental in the beginning is actually exist from avenged sevenfold?
I cannot be the only one that wanted the village people to get massacred at the end.
You aint lying. I am somewhat of a southern gentleman living in the last place the french ever touched louisiana. Like a french aristocrat from the 1700s I got some charm and charisma. This video is interview with a vampie level good
Sounds awful like that 😮 ...maybe driving its better but heard much better
Их клипы как будто часть жизни. Завораживающая магия,  словно прожил, прочувствовал часть жизни. Привет из России
Still best music video of all time
ATEMPORAL INSUPERÁVEL
This came up in a playlist mix while im playong video games and i didnt recognize it until hi my name is ronnie im an addict and i had to pause like wait what?
Yeah I found falling in reverse by accident. I'm 52 and some of their tracks give me goosebumps. Absolutely amazing 👏
...vampire lives matter...
Someone else said 5:44 BEEF PASTA now i cant unhear it
Nisiquiera sabia que existan hasta el dia de hoy! No me he perdido de nada!!!😂
Ronnie, you must audition to be Sweeny Todd should they ever remake that.
Ronnie, I loved you back in ETF, but now, you are my favorite artist, watch the world burn, voices in my head, losing my life, and last resort reimagined were all enough to make me consider this, but this revamped version has topped it off.  You are one of the very few artists of soul, talent, and creative genius left in this modern cesspool of culture that we call music.
OH MY Fucking God....What to Hell is this ??? I have goosebumps all over my body 🤘🖤🖤
Thank you for make a  Amazing Song 🎤🎶  🩸Vv--vV🩸 Muhaaa!
Interview with the vampire?
All the new lines in this song makes it feel so much better as a story. The original of him feels more personal.  Fucking love both songs tho🔥🙌
3:49 the song is very great but the way Ronnie fall down always makes me laugh whole day
It's amazing but I'm curious to know what it would be like with his deeper voice🤔
Yo Ronnie you believe in magic lol dale wolf wolf 🐺🇺🇸🇨🇺 Manny Money Gonzalez just saying hello 👋 wolf wolf 🇺🇸🇺🇸 good job dog and well the fruits of a bat will come in 😜😜🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇✌️✌️✌️💪💪💪💪💪🇨🇺🇨🇺🇨🇺🇺🇸😎🎧🎚️🎛️🎛️🔉🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🌬️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👹♈👹👹♈👹👹♈
a complete contridiction
JFC.  I'm new to FIR  (watch the world burn) and have just been mesmorized by everytuhing Ronnie puts out.  After becoming obsessed with "Last Resort", I decided to seek out the others.  I have no basis of this song but was absolutely floored and blown away by THIS version.  Ronnie is one of the greatest musicians of our era, if not all time.  I can only hope he gets the respect he deserves outside of his genre because god damn....god damn
Vai se foder, não tem um clipe ruim dessa banda!
MASTERPIECE !!!
Hands up if your here directly from Watch The World Burn or the new Last Resort? 😂 I’ve only found FIR recently but Ronnie is very quickly becoming my favourite artist ever…. He’s literally a genius!
F****** amazing
wowwwwww this is truly a masterpiece
🖤♥🖤♥🖤♥🖤♥🖤♥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥🙌
ලංකාවෙ එකෙක්වත් නැද්ද 😐🥴
This is a f'ing masterpiece. Best reimagined song ever. To hear the original as a high schooler like 10 years ago (which I liked)... like holy shiii. He's insane. I can't stop listening.
As i look back at the past.... nothing but incredible.....
Super!!!
My GOD...i have no words...if this song or Last Resort (reimagined) dont win a Grammy or the very least get nominated for one..i swear im done with the music Industry. Every single song this man does is pure effin GOLD!!!
Purely Magical! One of my favourite band just crashed one of my favourite songs from my another favourite band. Now I can't stop watching and listening this video on repeat.
Wow amazing
I wish they would do a whole album worth of reimagined work. There own music and covers. Or a short movie/musical thing
This was like a movie. Pure perfection! 🔥🔥🤟🤟
I wish I was a vampire.
its giving interview with a vampire
Vi o lançamento da primeira versão e agora essa, estou ficando velho kkkk
Grandi! L’unica novità degna di nota nel pal(r)co musicale attuale! 👏👏👏👏👏👏 Anke la loro storia è moooolto rock! 🤘🤘🤘🤘
2023
WOWOWOWOWOW RONNIE! 🤩
Ronnie has been INSANELY thriving lately this song is a literal fucking masterpiece work of award and deserves awards. I’d love to hear this in a theatre orchestra. He is so fucking talented
The Drug In Me Is Reimagined, I'm Not A Vampire Revamped and Last Resort Reimagined are all 10/10s.  Hopeing he continue to "Reimagine," & turn these mind blowing songs into a full goth opera 😍💔🥺.
Tremenda canción
Hi My Name Is Anthony , Im an addict ❤
One of the greatest songs I've ever heard omfg
Who’s still watching this today? This is still my favorite band ever 😊
SOOOO COOOOOL
Both versions are dope as fuck
Just discovered this amazing song. I love it so much! Ronnie really need to write/star in a Rock Opera lol
PUT@ QUEEEEEE PARIU
Anyone think he could play an amazing Edward scissorhands I just get that vibe but this was so beautiful and I really loved this song as it was but this was on a whole new level I have a shirt with a giant whiskey bottle on it that says whiskey seems to be my holy water 💙 it's one of my favorite shirts
Ooohh Paige is in this!!
OMG this is my heaven thank you ❤❤❤❤❤❤my goosebumps got goosebumps ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Ronnie is in fact an actual vampire
I still love the original so much... 1 of my favorite songs by Ronnie & FIR!
Kellin Quinn?
One Word: Powerful
im here for the theatric Ronnie
This version hits SO much differently, like...bro, I actually got choked up. The emotion he put into this is raw and powerful. He really channeled his inner vampire to create this masterpiece. This has been on repeat since it was released.
I think I prefer the older version lol
Is that Paige?
Tragico amor🥀
Amazing
🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
Oh just googled it that's his wife
Always gives me goose bumps this guy amazing talent
Anyone know who the woman is its proper bugging me seen her in something before
The women looks like WWE wrestler Paige.
This is a masterpiece 🎉
Scrolling through the comments, and no one notices that's Paige/Saraya in the video. You know, that WWE/AEW wrestler.   I noticed it was her the minute she showed up in the video, and then she debuts with Zombified in AEW.
Masterpiece
The vocals alone are amazing.
Did anyone notice he was wearing the cross earring in this even as a vampire?
Ronnie I do put this song on driving to work, u r Truly gifted sir
this song gives me shivers. well done. love FIR.
Can someone please tell Ronnie how fkn good is the doing? I love this videos
Can't get over how much he looks like my bf matt, hair and face and everything, probably the same age. I'm in a bus to chch, this helps my anxiety and depression and Nausia. Last listened to this song over a month ago when I lived with best friend, who kicked me 25th march, 4 days before my 45th birthday ❤😢😢

i have an unhealthy obsession with this music video and mostly the song 😭
I remember listening to the original 10 years ago.  This version is amazing. The level of emotion is unmatched. Accepting the outcome of your actions as well as the remorse. Whole song and video is so amazing ❤‍🩹
5:44 beef pasta!😡🤌🏻
YouTube need to add "I am fucking love this" button!!!

Genuinely didn't even recognize ronnie, he looks so great as a vampire. Should make a cameo in interview witha vampire
I'm rediscovering ronnie bcs of "watch the world burn" and it's been a while since I had last seen this master piece and I'm loosing my mind seriously. Fucking chills.
5:40 this is my fav part like how is this allowed to hit sooo goddamn harddd
I’m mesmerized and I don’t want it to end. ❤
One word: Amazing! One feeling: Goosebumps! 🙏🏼❤️👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
fuck why do i hear the bert mccraken scream
WHAT MOVIE AM I WATCHING?!! THIS IS SO GOODDDD!!
Saraya is phenomenally beautiful.
This is so beautiful yet so dark 🫠🧛🎉💜
still love muted palette in this video that focuses alot on the blood red :D
better than twilight 😎
Everything about this video is gorgeous! The voice, the pain, the aesthetics, Ronnie of course but especially the way it makes you feel. I like the original version but I absolutely love this one.
So beautiful😭🖤🖤🖤
Someone: Yo alex, which is your favore FIR song? Alex: yes
The best part start at 0:00
Wow what an amazingly talented man! This band makes the best videos 🤘🏻 Easy on the eyes too lol
I was introduced to this band after watching a cover by Halocene (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vT6Oi0HqlTU) and HOLY SHIT am I glad about that! I cannot stop listening to this band. This song in particular gives me chills every time I listen!!
Okay so is the girl in white just remembering everything that happened and then takes her own life becauae she cant ive without him? I a little confused on the one in white wondering around.
Goosebumps every time .  This is their best song , by far
Шедевр
the cinematic to this song speaks a whole different story, i love it.
WOW MATE AWESOMEEEE
🤟🏻
Thought this was cheesy and overdramatic at first. However after seeing Ronnie's videos the past week and learning of the man himself I can say thus is truly an absolute goddamm masterpiece.  Vocal showmanship after sooooo many years. Amazing dude !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I think this song has saved my life... Ronnie, and everyone who made this piece of art possible, thank you!
Long, wavey black hair on Ronnie looks seriously handsome on him❤️😄
Why I cant stop watching this video? Even more. I cant' stop watching all reactions on this movie. That's absolutely insane!
IM GONNA SAY IT  he’s adorable and cute I have a little crush on him but it little if I were in smash or pass I’d say smash just saying
where tf is the guitar??
La mejor película de vampiros que he visto.  Ni crepúsculo con toda su saga supera esta joya .
Muito muito bom
Пушка нахой 🤘
Haha. reVAMPed.
The excitement i felt when I typed in the search bar “I’m not a vampire revamped” and saw a music video ❤️
truly epic! Not usually a vampire type fan but this was beyond that. epic job
Is the girl page who used to be on wwe ? (Maybe they just look a like)
For his sins, she suffered. Love cannot conquer all.
Fuck I love this!!!!!
Thank you for showing us your soul
Unexpectedly Beautiful
I hope "revamped" was intentional
This is the voice for a generation. The sheer emotion - it takes a LOT to let go so much and yet keep so much control. Bravo (not that you need me to say it R ;) )
habia unavez una liebre de paris y se fueron argentina por la plata jajaja
missery lo0ves company you will need give it to her steve king feel the surrender to desire no more once let it rule you as fire alter call to death magnet the fate/ fat6e mof us all
Well with this and "the drug in me is you" i nevera heared this versions im enjoying this and crying at 2am ... it hurts a lot im broten no friends no family nobody
Bro I like the original but I LOVE this one it's wayyyyy better
This is a hole movie! I love it!!
What a beautiful masterpiece.
As an old follower of Falling in reverse I love this song since it came out in the album of (the drug in me is you) amazing album i felt his rage there his wrath. Now what I feel is his passion his vision his hearth. This guy is a true artist in hearth and soul.
wheres mcnasty? i just saw you on the original song
Imaginan que cabezas metidas en contis
Pleas come to Switzerland
Ronnie is the only artist who can go through multiple genres in one song, and yes I know I am commenting really late but I only ever heard of this song yesterday. Keep up the good work Ronnie
Whole experience
Juste... Magique!
Sempre volto pra ver essa obra de arte, isso é um filme amigos um filme!!!
I'm speechless
LOVE LIGHTZ & LIFE
this song gives me chills especially at around 5mins when he starts screaming, is so good😭
as much as I adore the original cuz it's super fun this version might be better, it feels more intense and theatrical
Ronnie Radke ❤
Hey guys. It’s been a long time. I tried really hard to make it. I hope you all have better luck than I did. Please, have perfect lives
This is a masterpiece
I had the original as my alarm for such a long time, i only discovered this version 6 hours ago and ive watched it about a dozen times, just having the idea to reimagine it like this is fucking genius! To then show the talent to put the vision together, make it sound like it does and to pair it with such an awesome video is just beyond belief! Take a bow son! I am 100% back on the falling in reverse train.🤟
What a spectacular clip ❤
красиво
i don't know how i feel about pre blackout ronnie anymore.. i love this, but something isn't sitting right.
I am about to cry. Hoooooly shit. MASTER PIECE
Not gonna lie but "The Drug In Me Is Reimagined" is a bit better.
Mofocker im a Vampire"" eewwww huww chillss. ❣️❣️🖤🖤🖤🖤
I love this song an I love that ronnie put paige in it
"HOLY SHiT THIS WAS INTENSE" 😲
Очень хорошее начало
Vampir ch gsn hun shde shal durgui hurchlee huurhii duu,amidral chi hunii zowlond tsadah bloogui yu?
I wish I could hear this for the first time again
People like to shit on Ronnie's newer music and covers but I'm not ashamed to say I love this.
The moment when you realize you wrote a masterpiece in the past but the music didnt fit exactly
It's a great song... So beautiful...
Ex WWE Paige, Current AEW Saraya❤
Ronnie amazing!!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️ Favorite,, cover'' song Beautiful ❤️
I'm sort of obsessed with the difference between the two versions of this song...     The old one sounds like drunken, debaucherous revelry. This one feels like a cry for help.
Saraya is really beautiful in this
Saraya is probably the most beautiful woman ive ever met
<3
This song bring me tears the pain is to much
This music makes me feel like I don't know what i'm trying to say so I will just stop saying anything.
This guy bro... Also it feels like I just watched a movie... But i'm also all fucked up yet feel less annoyed at life,
Não é só um clipe, é uma obra de arte!
Is there a video of this masterpiece live? But this version.
Wow, unbelievable. What a journey that was from the first second to the last
epic!
chapando ouvindo essa banda, foda dmssssssss
Should've done a second ending where she swoops down and rips the angry villagers throats out. Happy ever after.
This is better than the original in my opinion
Gonna add thia to the list of long songs I have memorized by heart. Any song Ronnie sings is a masterpiece
SARAYA KILLED THIS PERFORMANCE 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I can't stop coming back here... there is so much emotion in his voice. Whenever I'm feeling numb I'm listening to this to feel again
This is just a masterpiece it makes me cry of emotion 😊😊😊
3:48 omg this voice is perfect
Saraya/page in this video???❤️‍🔥😍
This is absolute fire.
This is a masterpiece! 🙌🏻
Это верх гениальности, наверное. Музыка и голос, и не важен перевод, делают что-то вевооброзимое, каждый раз льются слёзы... Хотя сам понимаю, нет причин лить слёзы. Но! Гениальная композиция! Сукко!... Уважуха!
Everything about this is a masterpiece.
Its crazy that the original version was like it was..this was meant to be a ballad and idc what anyone says! Its hauntingly beautiful
It’s been 2 years but I still want to say thank you for this ❤️
Como não apaixonar sempre por essa música? Perfeita
Goosebumps overall this Version is Epic
just amazing
I need him to just start making movies already lol
If home Is where my Heart Is, then my Heart has lost all hope....... La voglio come tatuaggio

My fav song
When the mob comes in to tie him up you can hear the pain 😢🖤
I love this song aalways <3
Since I found this version it's been like an entire year of "Learning how to sing with Ronnie" for me 😆 Seriously, he made me realize I should be an opera singer if I could keep the notes straight 😅
Most of this spectacle gave me chills... and I'm old and dead inside... I'm speechless :((
I’m seeing these guys in Orlando tomorrow at Earthday Birthday and I couldn’t be more excited!!!
Love the Decemberists reference in the lyrics.
Haha re VAMPed 😂
holy. fuck. speechless. again. ronnie wtf bro?!!? amazeballs.
**sighs in EMO**
Can't stop
I love his vocals, and the way they compose their songs! And this song is amazing 🥰
Is that Paige from the wrestling ?
Oh ... my ... god .... WOW !!! This is insane
It's art and every sound falling of his vocals is so amazing, I'm shock, I living a opera with a drama and I cry a lot, is meaningful
This needs at least 100 million views, let's do it
Just make the dame movie, I’ll watch it 🧛🏻‍♀️
Ronnie out here making better vampire movies than the big studios lol
Maravilhoso ❤
I hope this song got a Grammy or nominated for one at least
I don't know what to say..... I just cried.... masterpiece.
I discovered this song and video just two days ago… I’ve been watching and listening to “Watch the World Burn” on repeat since it’s release. But, this… this is… oh my god… what an absolutely incredible fucking masterpiece. I cannot stop watching this video. Over and over, literally all day. It hits me like nothing I’ve ever experienced before. I just wanna turn inside out from the frustration of not being able to put into words just how amazing this song (and video) is.  Bravo, Ronnie.  Fucking… Bravo, dude.
Sentí alma y vida, también me sentí muerto pero vivo. Esta genial 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
I gave up on the idea of writing something that wouldn't sound so insignificant compared to this extraordinary art
ES HERMOSOOOOOOOOOOO 😮😮😮😮😮😍😍😍
FUCK this song is a masterpiece!!!
Он чертов гений
Kurwa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!dawaj jeszcze!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!miazga!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Just Banger
This dude is ..SOMETHING ELSE
It is perfect 😱😍❤🌹
This deserves alot more views
Another masterpeace!!! Wow. Thats art, thats perfection. Insane! Can't stop hearing it.
He's not not a vampire!
wow
哇操
Your voice is like a drug I can't be without. 🖤
I introduced this song to my ex girlfriend , and she says "this man has a voice like velvet and knives" and I've never heard a more accurate description in my life.
porra meu nobre.... mt foda
Чувак однозначно крут!
Did anyone else peek when Ronnie's running he throws up the middle finger? Or maybe it's just the way it looked to me
Well it appears Ronnie watched Interview with a Vampire lol
I hope he brings out more like this.i mean everything is good.but I really like this style too
What an amazing videoclip. Marvelous. Ronnie's voice is powerfull.
I've never heard so much heart and passion in music. Unbelievable!
I got chills when I first listened to this song 😍
I don't know how many times I've watched this but the ending makes me tear up every single time. Absolutely amazing vocals and video
🔂
восхитительно...слов других нет, насколько это гениально...
PAIGE HERE!
All I can say is this is a masterpiece!
How. Genuinely, how. How. Speechless.
Every time I hear this song or watch this video, all I can think of is how much Ronnie needs to be in movies. His passion and acting are incredible...
If twilight was like this none of us would’ve complained
Einfach ein Meisterwerk
His music sound to me like the time we have now... He is not the only one to have lost hope, in this dark moment for mankind... We are billion.
Боже мой, это шедееевр!
Ебтвоюматькрасотищакакая!(Ronnnie i love U)
Such a powerful voice, gotta love It.
Jaw drop... Just amazing 🖤
Just watched popular monster, I think we can all relate one way or another. Can't wait to see them in the UK.
Any man that can sing “I feel like a lady who is pregnant with a baby” with so much soul and conviction has serious talent… 😅
damn man ronnie has some pipes.  love the song and vid...movie as usual
I’m not crying…
I only fell bad because this song have an end :(
That ending!, what a great work....there is so many other similar songs and bands, but F.i.R. is always in another level
Let’s not ignore that that is probably the most gorgeous woman I have ever seen in my entire life. Ronnie is probably the best artist I’ve ever heard, plus he can get it lol.
Holy shit this gave me shivers. The vocals AND the visuals are both absolutely gorgeous!! Why did it take me this long to find out that they revamped this? The original will always be close to my heart but I love this version too!! ♡♡♡
I literally love this song so much
this is.... is... a unbreakable masterpiece
Serya???
Am I only one who have very loud music and very low voice ?
Wow this song is amazing!
Someone sign him up for auditions on Interview with the Vampire. Dude seems like he can act, and has a great vampire look.
It's so cool. Great Ronnie and Saraya. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I ❤❤❤❤❤❤ you
I love how Paige is in this music video
I love how Paige is in this music video
Ronnie is the most extreme example of raw talent and absolute lack of taste that I’ve ever seen. This is genuinely impressive and hilariously bad at the same time😅
Well, I'm not a vampire But I feel like one Sometimes I sleep all day Because I hate the sunlight My hands are always shaking Body's always aching And the dark is when I feed Well, I can lure any woman that I want to in my bed With me And whiskey seems to be my holy water Mothers better lock your doors And hide your daughters I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness' sakes Where is my self control? If home is where my heart is Then my heart has lost all hope Well, I'm not a zombie But I feel like one today Self-induced comatose, chemical daze My head is always spinning From this dizzy, blurry vision And my stomach has had enough I feel like a lady That is pregnant with a baby 'Cause I'm always throwing up Hi, my name is Ronnie I'm an addict (Hi, Ronnie) Daddy should've never raised me on Black Sabbath I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness' sakes Where is my self control? If home is where my heart is Then my heart has lost all hope God bless all of you now 'Cause I'm going straight to hell And I'm taking you down with me 'Cause you know damn well I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness' sakes Where is my self control? If home is where my heart is Then my heart has lost all hope All hope All hope
It's literally a masterpiece
Masterpiece 👌❤
I love the band and this song so much
No words...
Vamp-ed  Hahaha  I like ronnie in that white shirt.
This is basically just Ronnie telling us that he IS a vampire. He fits the role so perfectly
👍👍👍🎬🎼🎤🥁🎸⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️👏👏👏🤟
Es una jodida puta obra de arte.
Its Amazing how Ronnie can take the same song from 10 years ago and make it sound totally different AND BETTER💯
Essa e "The Drug In Me Is you" REIMAGINED são as coisas mais lindas que eu já escutei na vida 🖤
Wow. So Ronnie is unstoppable now
straight up fuck the emo version of this song! Revamped is amazing!!
“ so I sharpen my teeth, because I love the way it feels when I sink into your skin and draw the only thing that’s real”.  That gave me fucking chills, good job Ronnie
Hi my name is Nico and I’m an addict.
I wish they would stage his concerts
Hearing this at 4am is different.
Major Tim Burton vibes
This is insane. The way this song hits me!!
Господи,  это офигенно!
He is just incredible.
Es que aún no puedo creer que no haya conocido antes a esta banda wn! Enamorada estoy! 😻😻😻
Such a beautiful voice, you re in my head all the Day 💕
I come back to watch this so much Saraya is literally the most beautiful person
The version we never knew we needed. ❤ so much talent
So powerful 👏 🙌
Dios que hermoso 😮🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🥲
The fact that he can sing legitimately anything -
Que mv foda mano
Found this band 2 weeks ago! This is hands down my favorite song!!! Idk how I've never heard of "Falling In Reverse" until "watch the world burn." I became an instant fan!!! 🤘😫🤘
why didn't he applied suncream?
cringe
Ronnie has achieved greatness
damn...how can´t I even know about this band before “Watch The World Burn”
Ronnie, help Aaron Ehrlichman rebuild his career, please, who, if not you, will help him. Deuce top🔥🔥🔥
ronnie with no ink is a great look with this style of clothes
shes gorgeous
This fucking masterpiece!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼
This guy sure knows how to push all my buttons
I'm not obsessed with this song. You are.
such a masterpiece, it made me cry 😭
Lyrics Well, I'm not a vampire But I feel like one Sometimes I sleep all day Because I hate the sunlight My hands are always shaking Body's always aching And the dark is when I feed Well, I can lure any woman that I want to in my bed With me And whiskey seems to be my holy water Mothers better lock your doors And hide your daughters I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness' sakes Where is my self control? If home is where my heart is Then my heart has lost all hope Well, I'm not a zombie But I feel like one today Self-induced comatose, chemical daze My head is always spinning From this dizzy, blurry vision And my stomach has had enough I feel like a lady That is pregnant with a baby 'Cause I'm always throwing up Hi, my name is Ronnie I'm an addict (Hi, Ronnie) Daddy should've never raised me on Black Sabbath I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness' sakes Where is my self control? If home is where my heart is Then my heart has lost all hope God bless all of you now 'Cause I'm going straight to hell And I'm taking you down with me 'Cause you know damn well I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness' sakes Where is my self control? If home is where my heart is Then my heart has lost all hope All hope All hope
Ronnie could make a movie, he's a good Story teller whit his lyrics and music video.
WOW
this is a true cinematic experience
Tan dramático el tema como yo, esa es la parte que me ha llenado
Just noticed that's pagie from wwe
The feelings I had while watching thus are indescribable. There was so much passion and emotion behind this song I could feel it it made me emotional. What a freaking masterpiece 👏👏
Me sigue despuntando los pelos de los huevos está rola
I think Ronnie Radke is the only person who can take Scene Music, turn it into Opera Music, and make it work
Masterpiece
I know people have watched this lately. But the Views don't go up. Have youtube stoped it for counting views?:)
Saraya looking like a straight up baddie in this tho
1:53 in poi, è una carica di energia
Just love to see all the new people here discovering FIR after watching Watch the world burn 🤘🥰
You losing your main lead from fallings start is like atreyu losing there lead screamer who is badass and has a different for of scream then you bro... Can't lose what makes you you in music so get it back you already showed you vocals like a melody and many other styles now get you lead guitarist back i miss him like randy Rhoades
Don't take this gay bro but I've followed your voice ever since behind these walls to escape the fates lame shit ass who was only great cause your voice and this by far shows how great your vocals are butttttttttttttt i love your metal with your old lead guitarist he was by far amazing with your vocals for metal and now sadly your guitarist are by far normal as crap i could play better leads then them and I'm just decent after 21years of playing but you're old falling in reverse lead guitarist shreds faces so get him back from that lame rough screen band wolf some crap is was so trash i couldn't remember the rest of the name but still pay him his worth and get your real metal back the music you truly are bro:) love the voice tho and this shows you badass
I don't really wanna go to hell, but this is a very good song. 👍10/10
I lost my mind when the strings come in ❤️ BRAVO
Paige in falling. Reverse
Why does this Not have a Grammy or Oscar???? Like seriously.. This needs recognition like right now
"Paige here"
Normally one tends to sing along…..but not with this masterpiece!im silent listening to all the layers the unbelievable vocal power and words that move your soul.I can’t believe we all are here where we belong.
Literally has me in tears with how good this is.
I can't get over the originality..it's truly hard to be something original and inspiring these days. Ronnie. You have something very very special here..I'm an addict myself ..I can honestly say that before I heard this song..I always felt there were no words that truly describe the weight one bears during addiction. But Ronnie nailed it. I will be supporting falling in reverse in anyway I can because there songs support me..thank you. Absolutely amazing.
Somebody give this guy a lead vampire roll let him produce it
He was bitten by Meatloaf
My furst time listening to the revamped version not gonna lie the ending really reminds me of vampire diaries
Insane song. So good
💓💓💓💓
This song is so beautiful
Ya know, I can't believe I slept on this band for 2 years only listening to Popular Monster and not exploring.  Shame on me.  This is what art looks & sounds like.
Tenía siglos sin sentir este drama e intensidad en una canción! Creo que los años que duramos sin verlo y escucharlo se acumuló y explotó furioso en este cantante. Los latinos nos están matando lentamente con el regueton, salvennos!
Just bit a baby i blame this song im not a vampire
Oh man Ronnie that was fuckin beautiful.
I’m embarrassed to say that I only came across Ronnie a few days ago after watching “Watch The World Burn” BUT I’ve been listening to him non stop ever since! He is the most talented artist I’ve seen in a very, very, VERY long time. Keep doing what you’re doing!
he can sing, rap, and growl at the same time, love this dude
Quite the departure from escape the fate
FODA.
I love the mini movies!   Check out  @TX2official
Rarement eue autant de frissons sur une chanson et tellement prise par cette voix que les larmes me viennent à chaques fois !
Блять где я был . Что за ШЕДЕВр !!

Bro why am I just not finding out about this band *2023
😍😍
thats great ❤️
Glad to see all the positive responses on this.
One of my go to songs..
Just love this is so many ways!
Ronnie is a vocal acrobat.
This is better than when Brendon Urie did a piano version of This is Gospel
Revamped is stolen from dungeons and dragons as the product came out the year befor in October of 2020 a re-released book based around vampires 4 months later this comes out lol I mean sound like  imagined what a joke.
Imagine satanic ritual abuse where you're made to grow hungry, for days. And when the time to feed is, when they bring you human flesh and blood, and to swim (stay alive) you have to swallow (eat and drink) of the human flesh and blood. Art serves a few purposes, namely, experience drives artistic expression. Did it break those chains or put new ones on you?
This is so powerful and beautiful..Epic!!!
La letra ..... Wow... Gracias Ronnie 💜🔥
Wow hace tanto que no veía y menos escuchaba arte de verdad! Wow estoy maravillada, wow! 🔥💜
God u make me miss Josie Whales Branch may his spirit live on
So intense I love it
Master piece! Video, lirycs, music, voices, and Ronnie 🥰😈🔥
God damn
The lost Blackwell brother
words dont do it but four words is not enough
Juste wouah ! C'est une pure merveille cette chanson !  Ce groupe est extraordinaire et Ronnie, est incroyable ! Nous les avons découvert il y a peu et nous nous sommes pris une claque monumentale ! Leurs chansons sont des chefs-d'œuvre ! Un immense merci de Vendée en France...
Is this supposed to be metal? Sounds more like it's from the True Blood soundtrack... lame.
Count Ronnie lol
This gave me fucking chills and im not even lying
This is the first time I listen a song from falling in reverse and... I'm shaking... what just happened? I'm speechless and excited and impressed and... this so fckin awesome!
Un très beau morceau, un très beau message.
Chalé no les entiendo ha ninguno.. JAJA  soy de México.. 💚🤍❤
fun fact: this is not your first time here 🤣
Just discovered this artist and daaaamn. How did I miss this! This should of won some type of award!
So Guys I have a question. I just discovered Falling in Reverse’s band since a couple of weeks more or less. I seen there’s a old version of this song but, in this version ( revamped ) it’s like he’s changing all the meaning of his lyrics. What’s this? What’s the difference meaning between 13years ago vs now? Can someone explain me this? I just know he had a past of drug and law problems
2 years ago first time i see it
o cara é monstro versatilidade defini  Ronnie !
This Song is so awesome.  I can feel all his emotions and i get goosebumps every time i listen to it . Great Job 🧛🏻‍♂✝🔥
I did not expect this but I love it 😍
VERY talented
HAPPPYYY 13M VEIWS ON MY BIRTH MONTH AND 13 IS MY FAVOURITE NUMBER LETS FUCKING GOOOOOO (quite literally my favourite song)
How sad... Pity them...
What a crazy revamp ! This was mind blowing ! I used to listen to the original a lot at the time, and this version sent me to the moon man !
I am So in love with the song and video was a amazing 🥲🖤🥀🖤
He can easily write  and play brodway musical...he is so intense, dramatic, theater... but not just on camera, he is so emotional expressive on the songs and voice technique!
Such a mesmerizing masterpiece. The chorous, strings, the band and Ronnie in a perfect harmony. Your art is beautiful FIR!
MUTHA FUCKER!!! I’M A VAMPIRE!!!!!😂
Morbius literally stole this for the plot
And I thought the other version was awesome. This one is sooooo good!  I love both.
imagine when he said black sabbath ozzy showed in the clouds
Holy shit! I have goosebumps!
Epic song and video! 🖤
Masterpiece 🫠🫢😂
How have I never seen this version before? If you could only see my goosebumps right now, you'd be laughing 🤣  Awesome work
Wow!!!! what a songMOvie please make more songs like this.
You would be a sexy Dracula actor.. I’m so obsessed with this song
holy shit ronnie i didnt know you could scream like that and ive been listening to you since escape the fate goosebumps bro
Simplemente, para mi lo tiene todo. ✅ Vampiros ✅ Coros angelicales ✅ Lenguaje Audiovisual ✅ Drops Epicos con sus buenisimos Buildups ✅ Un cantante que hace que quiera volver a escuchar su voz  Cinco de Cinco, esto es un pleno para mi !!!
Amazing work ♥️
Listening to this while stoned makes this sound even better❤❤❤
simply amazing I love it
I guess every day that passes i feel it more n more. I guess im not a vampire  Im the ghost
Eu amo como todos os clipes deles parecem um filme

Wow
I miss Derek ú_ù
My GOD< that was the most fucking BEAUTIFUL song I've ever heard from just about ANYONE!!!  What an achievement in not only storytelling, but musicality, and visual artistry! Simply STUNNING!!!!
I'm 100% sure that, the house in this video, is the same house in the music video Tonight Is The Night I Die by palaye royale.
This is better than twilight.
Очень Крутая песня🎉
I still don’t understand the narrative of this video,can anyone please help?
JESUS FUCK
I love the music video so much.
muito foda pqp
MOTHERFUCKEEERS I AM VAMPIREEEEEE
He had this mystery to him, this darkness ...yet so soft and at the same time so vulnerable so real ...his voice
I havent heard a new song I really like in YEARS. Modern music is horrible. This however might be the best song Ive ever heard. Good lord. I can now finally point to an artist I like. Thanks for that.
wonderful voice ...you have so many styles and i really think it is insanely beautiful :) I am in love.
Why’s this so powerful
I could watch a million more videos like this one 😍😍
This song is so beautiful
One of my Favorites!!
Masterpiece as we are used to from falling in reverse
My dad used to dance around the room when i was a baby jamning to Black Sabbath, can totally relate..
Brilliant!
WOW nuevamente me dejaron sin palabras
Why am I crying at the club?
I wish David Draiman would sing a cover of this song
Love always you and your family. Mucho gusto en tre Bien y que no?***?
I love this guy he is awesome I needed this song
Ronnie without all those tattoos = pure sexy. He would make an amazing vampire for sure… and let’s not forget Saraya!!
A Fucking masterpiece
I added this to my playlist by accident (thought it was the original) but I decided to keep listening and I'm glad I did cause damn...... This was so beautiful I didn't expect that-
That was beautiful
The aesthetics of this version slap better than the original , ronnie real conveys natural pain in his voice , especially with the bridge before last chorus (scream part )
Why does this feel like a Wattpad story
My heart got broken in one thousand pieces...
Masterpiece.❤
when are we getting the whole album redone this way pllsssss roonnaarrdddd
Reminds me Van Helsing
Hearing two different versions of this and other songs since i was 12 and 13 years old... a decade ago, its a beautiful transition in genres, i will always love both versions of your songs
Don't quote me but, he might be , a vampire ..
Lady seemed a bit of a waste. Gave her that power and she's like, "nah, I still want death."
My goodness, I just know that this guy needs to take atleast 2 months off between recordings just to get his voice back! Never liked this kind of music UNTIL NOW! Thank You!
Thanks god you are not a vampire, coz i thought you are, cool, now i can continue have intim relationship with your mom and not be eaten.
too much
Se me eriza el pelo cada vez que veo el final , ¿ este es el comentario en español que buscabas?
UK IS KEEPING FALLING IN REVERSE NO LONGER ALLOWED TO PLAY SHOWS IN THE USA RONNIE RADKE IS NEVER ALLOWED TO COME BACK TO THE USA
Man I wish he would sing this version.. I'd probably tear up
Saraya is so beautiful!!
I'm not a robot but this website thinks im one
Siempre me ha gustado Falling in Reverse. Ronnie canta en todos los estilos musicales. Simplemente hermoso
I want Weird Al to do a shot for shot remake of this music video - except he’s an umpire. The visuals, the piano, the impassioned screaming. He does it all while dressed in a black and white jersey and adding in clever baseball references
I guess he was a vampire after all
esto...es una obra de arte,una maravilla de la musica,mis aplausos de pie!
My sister and i love this song a lot because it is just so freaking beautiful, and the art of video is so top notch. Plus, Ronnie and Saraya is such a beautiful couple! They should definitely do more music videos together.
He is Nuts
This is a song I keep returning to. I can relatate in so many ways, with the prison sentence, the demonisiation, and the mostly the lonelyness of it all. I have a chronic, deadly, inlness on top of it all, and Falling in Reverese lets all my anxiety, my utter sorrow, get it some release.I keep on struggling, but i still know that I will die alone, and all that entails. This song gives me power, not only the remake, but the original as well. It gives me hope that I can be happy in my last days. So thank you, Falling in Reverse <3
Lindo
Omfg
what the fuck i just watched? masterpiece is an understatement
Saddest music video ever and yet also the greatest.
Not what I was asking for o
Wow
a esto se le llama evolucionar <3
EF SA NE👍🏼🇦🇿
Falling in Reverse is rising
Ronnie, you can do whatever you want.  I'm totally convinced! This is one kf my favorite songs and you just made it even better!!!
Ma vez
Another masterpiece
I'd rather be a werewolf
Nossa que clipe lindo.🖤🖤😮😮
Only one word describes this song for me: DAMN!!!!
Somehow I feel like he should write and sing the theme for The Joker
His voice is so strong. He’s amazing

Fucking masterpiece. I had never heard of Ronnie before, but holy crap....he nailed this on so many levels. Song melody 10/10. Lyrics 10/10. Video 10/10. So many genres mixed into this masterclass of a song.  Congrats Sir, you put yourself into history with this one song.
R.i.P Derek Jones and his wife im not sure but i think the song ist about derek jones and his wife 🤔
Wonder if he’d cover any meatloaf songs
Wish I could turn the volume up more but the little speaker doesn’t go louder
This is just phenomenal! It's so f****** good from the musical composition to the chorus to ronnies voice it is just absolutely amazing there is nothing to take away from this performance in his vision of what he wanted this to be absolutely perfect!
OUT THERE IN SPACE THERE WAS A GULLET MADE FROM THE FLEASH OF A SWAN A HOLE IN IT'S STOMACH AT THE END BLOOD VOMIT AND SALIVA LINED THE OPENING SHE SLIPPED INTO THE WARM DARKNESS THE OESOPHAGUS SPLIT IN TWO SLIDING INTO A CORRIDOR
NEVER would of thought..  such a iconic moment. full circle for sure.
He is a God damn musical genius. He just is. Tbh I don't know many others in the world with talent like this.
wonder where that mansion is??
He is so amazing, so talanted, and beautyful!! Is takes every part of my soul!
we need a new "interview with a vampire' sequel
banger
Muito foda
I seriously don't understand if it's serious or is it a parody.
POW not aloud to c the sun shine
Nah.... original is SO MUCH better
a fucking masterpeace
Oh dear.
MAMMA MIA!
I know the original song, and hearing this one gave me agony because of the slowness... but the video itself is beautiful
What's funny is the "real place: you brought me .... was another fucking. Dream.  You can NEBER TOUCH Reality!!!!!!!!   You don't even deswlerve the chance to touch it.  Let ot go.........
One of the few times I’m happy I discovered a band later than sooner
It's a masterpiece of music. The best song
So beautiful. No one can do it like Ronnie! 🖤🩸🦇💯 god he is untouchable sometimes. Keep it coming RR! We’re so here for it!
Dude that was fucking insane.
Ronnie we need a musical
That women in the music video it's Former WWE superstar Paige and right now she is in AEW now and go by her real name. Yes they are dating. They are together as a couple. She mentioned it in public they are together.
Ronnie you're AMAZING
My dad originally sowed me this, and at the time I didn't think I would like it. Yeah, well its one of my favorite songs ever now. Just the emotions and heart put into this... I had cold chills at the end of it.
Ronnie's been one of my favs since Escape the fate. Now he's kicking it way harder, and it's passed more than a decade. I feel he's done a lot of work on himself (mentally-wise too, he's a very intelligent guy and as intelligent people usually are cursed by melancholy in this world and society, he sure had and has to deal with some burdens and I'm happy to infere that he's dealing with em). It is all so refreshing, even tho their new songs are still in line with his/their style. KUDOS to you guys, so happy to support real ARTISTS 🤟
His voice is amazing. The range and his ability to scream! I am blown away by his talent. I really love his revamped songs! The theatrics really showcase his talent.❤
This was a great reimagining. His vocal range and emotion is top notch. Though I still do prefer the og, though tbf that could be due to nostalgia
Whiskey is my holy water.  Well, I am not sure how to reply to this.
Im Not a Vampire to 😢
Why Nicolas Cage is sing?
I love this music video because it reminds me of the old school fright nights ❤
I see you brother
Straight fire 🔥
Absolutely love this! He's a amazing vocalist!
i'ts never getting boring, masterpiece.
When are you making new songs???
🤍🤍🤍🖤🤍🤍🤍
Ufss excelentisima banda
My heart on the last choruses just tore to shreds, it's so sensual, I want to scream just the same This vocal, this scream comes not only from the voice, it is expressed through the whole body, the whole soul, such a powerful energy is released wooow
If you replace "Vampire" with "Depressive" or "Depressed", the song takes on a much deeper meaning.
Can someone tell me when he record this? Cuz seems like he has no tattoo in this vid...
I'm speechless This was incredible! What an experience!
How in the hell am I know just finding out about this amazing song!!!
I wonder if he cringes at the demonic part. I mean he played the part well but its funny af.
Omg! I have chills!
I consider this a spinoff of Interview with the Vampire 🤣
RIP Derek Jones.. man didn't know he had passed away back then sorry to hear that.
Ini kayaknya lagu GGS, tau kan (GANTENG GANTENG SOLEH)😂
Never heard of this band.  ❤️  LOVE ❤️  The music video
OMG Ronnie, you are a true talent! Your rendition of this song is absolutely stunning and shows your immense musical ability. Your voice is really unique and fits perfectly with the awesome sound of this song. You are truly a master of your craft and I am delighted with your performance. Thank you for making such great music! 👌
Ronnie’s vocal range is complete and total INSANITY!!! Truly amazing!
Did he just create a new genre called screamo opera??
Everytime I finish singing this song I feel like passing out
Who else just loves this song
this is the most dramatic version of im not a vampire I’ve ever seen still fire though
My sins aren't yours but I love you for expressing how equal we are far as sin.
The one frome 2010 was better😪
IS THERE NOTHING THIS MAN CAN'T DO MOTHER FLIPPING GOD SUCH TALENT!!!! I LOVE LOVE LOVE RONNIE GOOD GOD! I literally discovered his music and I am like DAMN where the fuck have I been????
Omg!!!! I looooove thissssssss NO ONE CAN'T BEAT RONNIE!!!!! 🖤🤘🏼❤️‍🔥
If they ever remade Bram Stoker's Dracula, Ronnie must play Dracula! No one else will do.
Hi my name is Ronnie and I'm an addict.
Best music video song in the last 5 years. Change my mind.
開頭的音樂就很有哪一種陰森古堡的感覺，而且這位歌手的聲音好好聽，控制聲音的方式也好厲害，又發掘到一首好歌(*´˘`*)♡
The burn in the sunlight was magical.
Incredible talent!! Love this
I swear, Ronnie's Voice is MORE than a Mixture of Fergie and Jesus
Is this opra?
😳 that was epic, fortunately I don't have any daughters to lock up, my door's always open, to play some ivory keys. Nice piano 🎹
as a person who is used to his older music, i dont like it, its not my style but im not gonna give shit to people who put other people down for liking the revamped version. i absolutely love the video though, its stunning
The blood curdling screaming in his voice towards the end of the song is heart wrenching.. omg
pure talent.. the silhouette of this melody really has a flow to it. ^w^ Your music really is impacting and no matter who tries to copy you, know your roots and stay true to them. This very element flows through you. which can't be mimicked.
Damn the emotion, drama and different vocal ranges in this song is incredible
the initial song was eh, but holy s**t this revamp HITS! vocals, instrumentals beautifully done
DAMN 🐋!
Still gives me chills everytime I listen to it
Not sure if I know of anyone that sings with this much emotion.  Popular Monster is my go to when I just feel the rage coming up.  Just drive by myself and blow the speakers
Fuck that was epic
cecilion x carmila MLBB
Ronnie should embrace his inner Meat Loaf and get a hankerchief and do all piano power ballads about love.
The Twilight: the musical obviously has a bloated budget. They could have casted Dani Filth for pennies on the dollar..
I'm speechless, 13 years ago when I was listening to escape the fate I never would have though Ronnie radke would turn into such a well rounded talent
MASTERPIECE!
💓
I have no words. Absolutely a masterpiece
Wow that is a incredibly dark ending. Wow.
Well, I'm not a vampire But I feel like one Sometimes I sleep all day Because I hate the sunlight My hands are always shaking Body's always aching And the dark is when I feed Well, I can lure any woman that I want to in my bed With me And whiskey seems to be my holy water Mothers better lock your doors And hide your daughters I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness' sakes Where is my self control? If home is where my heart is Then my heart has lost all hope Well, I'm not a zombie But I feel like one today Self-induced comatose, chemical daze My head is always spinning From this dizzy, blurry vision And my stomach has had enough I feel like a lady That is pregnant with a baby 'Cause I'm always throwing up Hi, my name is Ronnie I'm an addict (Hi, Ronnie) Daddy should've never raised me on Black Sabbath I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness' sakes Where is my self control? If home is where my heart is Then my heart has lost all hope God bless all of you now 'Cause I'm going straight to hell And I'm taking you down with me 'Cause you know damn well I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness' sakes Where is my self control? If home is where my heart is Then my heart has lost all hope All hope All hope
Fucking masterpiece every time
OMG this was so dramatic it would be a GREAT song to have an open empty room full of mirrors to dance your heart out
New falling in reverse>>>> old falling in reverse
much better than the original
It's rare to find a singer that quit drinking I'm inspired by you two
Saraya's his new vampire. How cute
My Sister: Sings "I'm not a vampire - and then goes Shut the F up yes are😂😂🤣🤣
What genre is this exactly?
This is easily the best origin story for Castlevania's Dracula I've ever heard
IM IN LOVE
Well, I'm not a vampire But I feel like one Sometimes I sleep all day Because I hate the sunlight My hands are always shaking Body's always aching And the dark is when I feed Well, I can lure any woman that I want to in my bed With me And whiskey seems to be my holy water Mothers better lock your doors And hide your daughters I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold?

I'm not a huge fan...but God damn, right to the center of my soul...
What a absolute tune!!. This brings back so many vibes and brings new  meaning to adulting 😂😂😎
Vibes interview with the vampire
Idgaf.
Black Sabbath, a band I like, is a cautionary tale band, I don't know if he listened to them. Now if he name dropped some other bands that were inspired by the Satanic Panic from the later 70's early 80's I might feel this song was better. I mean if he had said he had been raised on the Beatles, a band I like, I would take it more seriously as causing harm. I also feel that his alliteration in the song is a little predictable. The line "I feel it in my bones and coursing through my veins" I believe it would have been better to mix it up with, " I feel it coursing through my veins and rattling my bones". One for the meter of the rhyme and for the line up of the later rhyme. Otherwise this artist/ band is pretty good and with time his craft will only get better. I can only hope that he won't burn up with all the sudden fame. Pun intended. I think touring and playing live will really take this band/artist to the woodshed and make him better. I really hope he does not get lazy with fame because he has talent and could possibly do things like Meatloaf. Let's wait and see!
Ronnie is at the top of the game, without a doubt. What a talent!
I just fucking love this! Damn * chef's kiss *
All the wannabe bad metal guys feel like little angry children as I inhale these emotions. I love his music and emotions, I really do. ❤
If MTV was still a thing, this would easily be on top for a while...
well Damn.. Why did i get goose bumps with this masterpiece.. Amazing remaster !
I like this video.
The best song ....
Just a Masterwork!
Okay but the girl was rlly pretty….also wtf lmao
Ronnie had some serious vocal training huh? Incredible. I fell off the Radke Train for a while as I got older ya know? But he actually has progressed A TON. I got to give it to Ronnie he always catches up with his fans as they age.
I know it's been out for a while, but who knew that the best vampire movie/musical  was about 6 minutes
masterpiece
I'm sorry, but that was fucking beautiful. 🥲 👍👍💪💯👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
I keep replaying the ending where he starts screaming he's a vampire that whole video or just the ending should be nominated for an award.
Darn that was good😶🥲
I wanna say that I love Ronnie doing ballads... Please do more in the future! You do them so beautifully.
I feel like one. Sometimes I sleep all day to avoid the sun.
this man is so fine.
That's insane!!! Amaizing, awesome!!! I can't find more words!!!!
This is the Best music i heard
You Wolves?
Caracas me apaxoinei,ronnie é um artista completo.
The first beginning of the video sounded sad and emotional 😭that now I want to cry idk why 😭  Honestly not going to lie if Ronnie was dracula with that long hair he would fit with dracula role honestly 😭😍😳😳
Guilty Pleasure, Numero Uno. Best line: "Daddy should've never raised me on Black Sabbath"
beutifull i absolutly loved it
*proceeds to put eyeliner on*
THIS IS FUCKING SICK OML
Chills
🦇👁️🦇
foda pra carai
This is way better than the original
Beautiful masterpiece!
Ugh. Terrible
Shut up and LISTEN TO TYPE O NEGATIVE.  UGH.
he'd make a good Dorian Grey😍or he has a look of Max records about him from i am not a serial killer.
deserved tribute to derek jones, for his work in the band. rest in peace
Is his wife?
Please do it live!!!!!!!! It would be amazing!  I will cummmmmmm.......to the performance 👀
Damn you had to go and make me feel the feels again lol. Awesome work
Chills! Love he can do anything, especially the cross over to metal. Always a fan!
Really love this man, really cool and talented dude. THUMBS UP!!!!! 👍👍👍
Эта песня и этот клип, имхо, лучшее из всего, что я слышала у этой группы! До мурашек, до слёз, до кома в горле... Самостоятельный мини-фильм получился (хоть и многое мне непонятно по сюжету). Для всех поклонников немецкого фильма "Вкус ночи" - это шедевр. 😍🖤💜🖤👏👏👏 Буду слушать и смотреть ещё и ещё, до бесконечности... 🤘👍
Muito bom
mans got a nice voice
Got this stuck in my head ❤❤❤❤❤
What a fantastic production. I absolutely love FiR.
You are pure art, talented and creative ❤️
What power full word like uv lived it wild
Hey ronnie have you thought about movie producing? This mans movies would be sooo good
Iv watched this so many times now today I made me emotional
"I feel like a lady , who is pregnant  with a baby , 'cos I'm always throwing up "  A masterpiece.
You're voice is just incredible
Wow 😲 absolutely wow
Is that Paige/Saraya?
Revamped? so now he is a vampire 🤣
Love is felt deeply, He has lost someone he loves .He would not have been able to pull it off if not.
i've had this on repeat for hours. this is so beautiful. chills every time
Omg goosebumps 😵😵😵
I know the original, but i only listen to it once. I have some of Falling in reverse song in my playlist,  But i gotta admit, this revamped is indeed a masterpiece,
Eww this song is awful compared to the original
A year later, still in my top 10 of song songs on repeat. Cuz im going straight to hell!
i'm living for this. holy fuck, you're a god damn genius.
This is exactly what I needed
The original was upbeat and pumped me up!. This one.. makes me sit and question everything.. FiR over here able to make you wanna go riot like a mfker or make me wanna have a ballet
💖💖💖🖤💖💖💖
Seriously watch tim minchin darkside  lol 😆  love the song by the way
I'm on my 9000 listen
Currently obsessed with this band. Found out about their song when Saraya used Zombified as her entrance theme. Btw, is that Saraya in the mv?
The melody is beautiful, but the freaking lyrics are crappy, at least the first part. And the dude has some awesome pipes.
Better than original
Dude, this shits better than Broadway
Holy. Shit. What a masterpiece.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥mdsss que musica zika
This guy shouldn't be on Earth. Too talented for it.
This is justt a rare gemmm that comes along once in a life time 🤟🤟🤟🤟Ronniee is from another world
Don't hate the eyeliner the music is still great and that's what counts so fuck you and your jealous derogatory comments.
When I was younger I wanted to be a vampire, like every other 15 yo girl. Now that I’ve been battling addiction I can see the two are interchangeable. I am a vampire and sometimes wonder if everyone would be better off with me gone. I feel this song in my soul. If you’re battling any kind of substance abuse or addiction of any kind, you’re not alone and you can break thru. I don’t know what’s on the other side, but I’ll see you there. 🖤💔🖤💔
When you want to hear a song but what you get is a whole story in the lyric
1 year on and this still gives me mad goosebumps. Fucking love it.
He did this version for Derek after he died
💚💚💚🖤💚💚💚
I'VE ALWAYS HAD FAITH NEVER GAVE UP ON U what WONDERFUL VOICE AND A IMAGENATION out of this world
Ronnie are YOU that big of WUSSY ass IF YUR A VAMPIRE  U COULD HAVE KICK ALL THEIR ASSES  YET YOU SURRENDER TO A STAKE AND LET YOUR SWEETHEART DIE TOOOO,,,, THAT'S A PUSSY SONG FOR YOU ,,,,PLEASE PUT OUT A REVAMP #2 AND KILL THEM MUTHER FUKKERS.. THAT'S  MORE LIKE THE RONNIE I KNOW ! I GOT FAITH IN YOU BROTHER  OF THE BLOOD KILL THEIR ASSS AND SURVIVE WITH YOUR BRIDE AND RULE THIS P.O.S. OF A WORLD!!!!!!!
Aaaaaaaalter, das Lied holt mich komplett ab.... Danke für diese wundervollen Noten ❤️
The old one was funny but... This make me cry bro, is that normal?
This song makes every cell in my body feel something. Jesus Christ Ronnie is an asshole but he can sing like no one else.
Dare I say this revamp and drug in me remaster , have a modern meatloaf theatrical feel. His vocals are awesome and the videos are spot on.
We need a remaster/revamped version at least once a year
Much love Ronnie ❤ very powerful message!!!
Ronnie Radke: the only man who can actually make vampires *un*sexy.
... yup.
This is fucking EPIC. Just the production values on the track a video make this a fucking masterpiece.
I got to ask this is the women the same women,  Saraya?
this is truly a masterpiece !
Love his voice!!
He’s is SO TALENTED! Masterpiece!! Bravo
Anyone else obsessed with how perfect this is?
SARAYAAAAAAA
HOLY GOD OH MY- is IS IS- IS THIS REAL???? OH WOW ITS BEAUTIFUL RONNIE YOURE SO TALENTED FOR THIS WOAH
Holy shit this feels so.... real?  Every band is fixated on technical mastery these days like music is some kind of science based on mathematical calculations or shit.  This is pure and raw emotion. I haven't heard anything like this since early 2000's.
It’s a crazy masterpiece. I cried.
This makes me cry and i don't know why...lol.  It's beautiful 🥺
Now thats a good movie
A master piece and I love this version better
for a few moments i was contemplating clicking off the video lmfao! my reason is sorta a dumb one but i didn't see any fangs at the start, I stayed in the hopes i would see them and it didn't let me down lol. a good vampire always has a nice pair of fangs. This was awesome love the movie like feel of it and the lyrics are amazing.
Hands down best song still to this day 🙌🤘
I got goosebumps on my goosebumps... this track is an absolute masterpiece. I was fortunate enough to hear this version before the original.. this version slaps and stomps all over the original into oblivion.. this version is superior in every way it is possible.. the original was too 'pop' for me.. the upbeat fun beat didn't go with the strong lyric undertones.. where is version is an incredible interpretation .  I've not long discovered FIR, where this track and 'Voices in my head' being my top 2 from this artist. This group is awesome. keep them tracks coming guys <3
I know I'm late but 😂😂😂😂😂 Here we are again
I *GASPED* when i saw Paige
Ronnie has such a theatre kids voice, & the song structure too.
Wow~!
Best song arrangement I ever heard❤️
3:50 Beautiful !!
Thats badass Ronnie.
Such and underrated singer.
love this song so much
“I’m not a vampire revamped” I dunno seems kinda sus 🤔
Love it
feels like somthing is ripping my heart out of my Body
Y’all I started crying even before he started singing. Gosh at the talent!! Chills every time!
3:50 gave me chills
Damn awesome
is that Paige from wrestling? referring to the vampire that is
Just realized that’s whatsername from wwe/aew 🤣🤣
Blah hi my name is Ronnie I'm an addict
I was not expecting the I feel like a lady that is pregnant with a baby because I keep throwing up to be an entire verse. 🎃
Garbage
I love that he got his girlfriend to be in the video and also love this masterpiece
This is absolutely an AMAZING showing of his vocals!!!  INCREDIBLE!!
He is a musical genius
Is this what you wanted McNasty?
Oh my 😳😳 Saraya! .. So PERFECT!
okay... but the pun here. "re*vamp*ed" lol
A masterpiece. Can't stop listening
Every time I hear his final fry-belt at the end of the song, the vocalization reminds me of one of the songs from Atreyu's "Lead Sail and Paper Anchors" album. I can't remember the song or the lyrics, but I definitely remember that feeling. I'm not comparing the two at all, but that specific note makes the nostalgia hit hard.
Ronnie. You fucking musical genius 😭😭😭😭
Shit gives me tingles
I kept hoping you would do this song again, thank you falling in reverse!! this shows how much you can do now with music/film  and its amazing!! this was one of my favorite songs ever by them   i dont think words can even cover how perfect this is
I'm Not A Vampire...I swear... ... Legendary revamped here... Just Epic.
Well now Saraya's involvement makes a lot more sense now!
Revamped is definitely better.
Is this who you are hunny bunny
Apart of the puzzle
Good lord... this is a masterpiece.
This song is amazing
lololol re-Vamped lolo vampire chronicles
💜💜💜💜💜
💜
Dope as fuck I dig it
Best video ever.
This is absolutely wonderful
Makes me wanna dye my hair black and slip into those ripped skinny jeans again
I can't get over the note that starts at 3:53
the lyrics and the version changed my life.
F ing love it
I am insane <3 when did I become so cold? For goodness sakes... where is my self control....?
Brrrrrr... Frissons.
hee hee
I want more ! More musics like this please, this is a masterpiece <3
throughout watching the video all I was thinking is MASTERPIECE and then I go down and see fucking masterpiece as the top comment
https://youtu.be/gQ5TPORKZd8 New One
Awe ☹
The original is such a fun sound, this makes me wanna paint a masterpiece and hide it in an unknown location.
this version is much more dramatic than the original, but just as good as 🤘🦇
Wow. I used to sing along to the original. But watching this I'm speechless as I feel disrespectful to sing over his beautiful voice. What a masterpiece.
Thanks Ronnie, every time I see this I get a little hope that good, propper music is still being made.
🥲
Goosebumps
fucking masterpiece
WOW! This is the first time I hear this song and watched the video WOW!!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I love "Falling backwards"
I ALMOST like this better then the original....almost.
Yes, just yes!!
Masterpiece
MUSIC GENIUS THATS WHAT THIS GUY IS HES SO TALENTED I GOT GOOSEBUMPS. what can’t this man do for gods sake
A. FUCKING. MASTERPIECE that’s what this is
MASTERPIECE.
I love this video!! Ronnie's talents are presented in many ways, and impressive vocals....... love it!! And yes, I love the dark and macabre, but this is also about the talent he possesses. Awesome performance Ronnie!!
That's why I love vampires
1,000 times better entertainment than any of the new shows or movies from the last couple years. I could watch this masterpiece all day.
this shit way to good man
Ronnie is a gift....
Wooow
OH MY GOD
I look forward on someone performing this piece of theatre
He brought her back from death just so she could die again lol.
I'm glad Ronnie realized he was better than 2000's pop/punk. He has an amazing voice and his band mates are incredibly talented at the instruments they play.
Quit ruining your own songs
I love this so much
Was that the start of Hiatus by Asking Alexandria playing at the beginning of this? Lol
Ronnie radke master of all-style.
Прикольно
klip şarkıdan daha güzel!!! film gibi izledim
One of the biggest masterpieces ever.
No cap try closing your eyes and singing along
just fucking perfect.
Waow🤯
I feel this song deep in my soul
Каждый раз мурашки по телу!
So ist wahre Liebe😍
"Hi, my name is Ronnie and Im an addict" hits hard, because 10 years later its not just a catchy lyric....
He's a genius 💙🎶I'm 52 yrs old and was feeling unattached from everything,his music has made me feel alive again 💙💙💙💙💙
Wow, I love this so much... I liked the original, but this one is incredible. <3
💘💘💘
Sinplesmente incrivel...
Ahhhh the good old days. Welcome back to high school.
Art
Strait from the diaries
Where in the hell did he spring from, he can do everything, his voice is so strong <3 reminds of dark shadows or the originals.
Legit my first reaction was what the hell is this and why does it sound so fucking awesome?? Made my skin curl. Thank you.
Why did it took 1 fucking year for me to discover such a masterpiece?????? I'm I'm obsessed  Where is my self control?????
As a Vet suffering PTSD and becoming an alcoholic for 15 years, losing everything and finally attempted suicide on two different occasions... this song broke me. The upside is I finally overcame my addiction to alcohol and I'm able to put my kid through college and live a normal life. This really brought it back though... Amazing song, amazing artist, soul shattering lyrics.
This song is so beautiful.
I literally didn't recognize him wow he has changed so much but that voice still gets me 😏🥰😍😝
Hey ronnie can you just become a vampire???? Cause it fits you well
Wow! The girl is Paige the wrestler 😍🙈
the 2022 version of 'I would do anything for love' sung by Van Helsing aka 'Ronnie the addict'
Underated asfuck
I cant stop to watching this masterpiece
Thank you, Ronnie. You've given me one more song. I can lure women in my bed... With the right pitch.
this song was a great song
This version is absolutely insane i cant get enough
I'm seeing him preform tonight along with bad wolf papa rouch and Hollywood undead tonight
ive got literal chills its like a movie soundtrack
Id love to see this preformed live 😍
obsessed. shocked. no words <3
The virgin Twilight vs the Chad I am not a Vampire Revamped
If you dont feel this running thru your veins then your not alive!
Just….. damn….
Never heard of this but they bailed on my town tonight! I wasn’t going but glad there were a few other bands from the early 2000s that they could still have the concert!
goosebumps omg
I love you 💗😘😘💗
Well, I'm not a vampire But I feel like one Sometimes I sleep all day Because I hate the sunlight My hands are always shaking Body's always aching And the dark is when I feed Well, I can lure any woman that I want to in my bed With me And whiskey seems to be my holy water Mothers better lock your doors And hide your daughters I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness' sakes Where is my self control? If home is where my heart is Then my heart has lost all hope Well, I'm not a zombie But I feel like one today Self-induced comatose, chemical daze My head is always spinning From this dizzy, blurry vision And my stomach has had enough I feel like a lady That is pregnant with a baby 'Cause I'm always throwing up Hi, my name is Ronnie I'm an addict (Hi, Ronnie) Daddy should've never raised me on Black Sabbath I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness' sakes Where is my self control? If home is where my heart is Then my heart has lost all hope God bless all of you now 'Cause I'm going straight to hell And I'm taking you down with me 'Cause you know damn well I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness' sakes Where is my self control? If home is where my heart is Then my heart has lost all hope All hope  All hope.
They need stop playing and do all their music like this now. Revamped FIR love the band but can't even listen to the originals anymore. Just not the same.
Wait.. is that Paige? 😍
I didn't think I could love this song more than I already did and here Ronnie comes with this fucking masterpiece.
Perfect song, perfect video. I am starting to love this kind of music.
This is very marianas trench I love it!
Is that Paige from WWE?
He would make a good Loki
This just doesn't sound like Ronnie vocal wise. It to me either sounds like someone else was singing or there was a lot of electronic help in the studio. I love this band and ronnies voice but this just didn't sound right. Good song tho
The beginning is so lame, but if you're strong enough to stay to the end, maybe you'll like.
Holy shit why didn't I watch this earlier
Stunning..no other word for this work of art.
das ist der Wahnsinn!!! Bravo
My ears thank you for this so beautiful pieces
This is fucking magic
That was pretty awesome
This is what happens when emo kids don’t get bullied in high school
Ronnie needs to make this a movie
Ronnie ronnie ronnie this is absolutely hands down epic!!!!!!!
Love it!! Great song  :) 🧛🧛🧛
I'm addicted to this song 😭 really i can't (and dont want ) to get over it🔸♡🔸
❤ MAGNIFIQUE ❤
We need an entire reimagined/reworked album of TDIMIY or the hits.
I've always loved falling in reverse since the first versions of this song.  Since reimagined  came out and re vamped my little 6 year old daughter and my mom are in love.  Anytime I get in the car they want ronnie mom lol.......my little girl says it's beautiful mom.......his voice and she sings loud.  RONNIE COME TO MONTANA IT WOULD BE OUR DREAM COME TRUE TO SEE YOU SING THESE SONGS........
ronnie is the fucken man!
Ronnie i know what your going through.
Dont let these losers fucken put you down there is people that care.
Im crying right now literally.
If your true fans you would look into what these songs were about.
All you care about is music and you dont even notice the end his brother is derek jones he just died.
Stop thinking hes acting this is pure feeling and im sad that his brother just died because my uncle just died.
Take a good look his brother derek jones died.
This is real emotion.
His brother just died thats what this song is about.
holy shit I just came here from the original and I loved that one but T H I S is a goddamn masterpiece
Oh... Hi, Paige! ^-^ Hope you wrestle again one day :3 You're definitely a great wrestling personality
💐❤️❤️❤️ I enjoy this GUILT FREE
Masterpiece. From meaning to production. I felt this in my bones. Thank you.
Love the emotion put into this
This is EPIC! I'm so blown away by Ronny's talent.  The visuals , the music and his voice!  It's a Masterpiece.
Espectacular!! Acabo de descubrir a este grupo y esta canción me ha dejado sin palabras. 10/10 menuda voz 🤘🏼🙏🏼
this is going to be our marching band opening and its cleary gonna be epic as shit
Well, I'm not a vampire But I feel like one Sometimes I sleep all day Because I hate the sunlight My hands are always shaking Body's always aching And the dark is when I feed Well, I can lure any woman that I want to in my bed With me And whiskey seems to be my holy water Mothers better lock your doors And hide your daughters I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness' sakes Where is my self control? If home is where my heart is Then my heart has lost all hope Well, I'm not a zombie But I feel like one today Self-induced comatose, chemical daze My head is always spinning From this dizzy, blurry vision And my stomach has had enough I feel like a lady That is pregnant with a baby 'Cause I'm always throwing up Hi, my name is Ronnie I'm an addict (Hi, Ronnie) Daddy should've never raised me on Black Sabbath I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness' sakes Where is my self control? If home is where my heart is Then my heart has lost all hope God bless all of you now 'Cause I'm going straight to hell And I'm taking you down with me 'Cause you know damn well I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness' sakes Where is my self control? If home is where my heart is Then my heart has lost all hope All hope All hope
Listened to it on my second day and it's awesome 🔥
fucking love this timeless mASTERPIECE
To any wrestling fans. Nikki Bella and Artem were supposed to do this video but Nikki was pregnant. I only came here for Paige/Saraya but, I loved this.
Wow, didn't expect to see paige here 😳
I LOVE 💕
Excellent. It's a masterpiece.
YEAHHHHHHHHHH
All together it's a masterpeace and shout to WWE fans, Paige here is like strawberry on this cake ;)
This few minutes  mv is much better then all vampire movies I watched, the way I feel chills in my bone though. You are  fantastic.
That was fucking insane would be a good movie
We get it Ronnie, your awesome in everything you do ❤️🤘
Como vas en tus caminos clavel negro un saludo desde aqi en donde te veo  una luna nueva  alumbra para nosotros los hijos del tiempo  el ser supremo cuide a tu sol Willow tu ser a los qe quieres amas lograr lo qe qieres siendo tu mismo  mira al cielo recuestate el el césped siente el viento bbe un trago y salud  por lo qe ha de venir sin miedo al vivir  cuidare ser esculpido por el maléfico
This is hilariously bad
This song "revamped" is definitely amazing.. The way he plays the piano is stunning..
This may be a stupid question but is that Saraya in this video?
The ending of this song just gives me complete chills and shivers down my spine he’s so talented this song is just a piece of art it’s unreal

WOW
Excellent song and video!!! 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 ^_~
Aside from this and remagined drug in me. What else did he remixed like this. Hot damn its so good.
this is what morbius should hav been
Did anyone else get emotional as fuck or cry at the end?!? So fucking tragically beautiful!!!
Muy buenooooo
I’m now a emo after watching this what a banger
is that paige from wwe?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOQRwbmI24k - check out this one :)
Dear god... the sfx team did a phenomenal job. I've never seen a vampire burn in the Sun, but that's exactly how I'd expect it to happen.
I am extremely impressed with what Ronny turned this song into
its morbin time!
This is epic...
OMG, it took me a year and a half to realize SHE is the vampire... That's why she was saved with his blood, making HIM a vampire. And the blood she's wiping off the floor was actually HER snack...
Good work Ronnie and falling now that's a good mix and theme of the video is really good Castlevania style
похож на дору
Sat at bus stop listening to this watching the sun go down. Feel so goth I may have to go and sack Rome.
Two things, actually three -This is amazing -Did Danny Elfman help write the music  -And three is there a live version or behind the scenes and or making of this ?
Sooooo... Ronnie. U keep saying music video..    Ronnie- yea  Bbuuuttt u gave us a movie..  Ronnie- yyeaa?   Dude this is A MOVIE, LIKE, ANIME THIS SHIT OR SOMETHING.   ronnie- it's a gold Music vid I don't see what the issue is.  .... movie ronnie..Ronnie... movie.
If Interview With A Vampire is ever refilmed I will put in a petition for Ronnie to be cast as Louis
Anyone else think someone was knocking on your door?
I’m not a vampire is my favorite so finding this is just perfect, exactly what I’ve been looking for.
Lose what you love but never knew what you had until it was to late..  you lost your self..until you see your love. so, you want to save your love.. but it is to late for you. Very sad.
wow
this is art at it`s finest💖
wow this is incredible, is there anything ronnie cant do?!
Who would say I'd find Paige here around?
Listening to this with headphones on full volume makes me ascend
Masterpiece ! Fucking Masterpiece !
Allen Carr - Alcohol - RR - Pls read. \m/.
Well... this is quite breathtaking...
DAMNIT, RONNIE ❤
I don’t know where I’ve been my whole life, but wow this gave me goosebumps. So freaking good. I just been listening to them here and there for the first time. But this is my favorite I’ve heard so far. The emotion he conveys is so raw and vulnerable. So tragically beautiful. This is the kind of music I love. The kind that just hits you in your soul so deeply. This video is a cinematic masterpiece too.
OMFG!!!!
Geniusz !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
DE VERDAD NO LO PUEDO CREER, RONNIE CRUZO TODOS LOS LIMIITES MUSICALES Sin duda mi artista favorito de todos los generos. Cada año mas maravillada de esta persona cuya creatividad evoluciona y muta de formas increibles. Siempre y por siempre fan de Falling in Reverse.
trivial song
This song is a master piece 🙌  I listen to this song daily, sometimes multiple times a day since I discovered it. There's no other song out there that is so versatile and theatrical it truly is pure gold ✨️ perfection 💯
id be your number 1 minion dude
Meat Loaf Reborn !
Who is the girl
Saraya being in this video is ironic given the name of the song
Advice to anyone who 'drowns out' the voices/trauma/memories: stop. Yes uv proved it works to yourself. Go living the rest of ur life without that depression pill because it CAUSES depression. Same as all pills with the name in what it's for. ....birth control pills literally give females an excuse to trap men into rel skipping a pill whenever thee want- because any brain KNOWS birth control pills kill the EGG (after sperm impregnated it). It's not rocket science. I knew that before proving it in a microscope.
what a voice
love the video but record me and i will make this video perfecto
Siempre escuchaba esta canción cuando me dirigía a mi colegio hace muchos años.
This is way too good, I was not ready for this 😭
Dayum, he look like Loki at some angle 🔥🔥
malzeno
This is incredible. Such passion and the visual storytelling. Superb!
This version is the GREATEST SONG OF ALL TIME. No song with ever top this. He makes me feel something every time. Thank you SOOO much Ronnie for making this revamped version. It blows me away every time I hear it.
Nossa !!!!  so descobri essa versão hj  Que incrível , parabens F.I.R
Idk why he hasn't performed this version live yet..
Flawless 💜❤️
This hits like a truck every fking time. Masterpiece 🖤
3:52 Goosebumps
In fact, this title is a short film with the high level of Ronnie's voice.
You not gonna balive me but this is the BEST song I`ve ever heard  about Vampires and I REALLY ENJOY IT
This is why women are attracted to the bad guy image.
This is why women are attracted to the bad guy image.
Vampire approved.
Paige is really broken <3
This is epic
Красиво👍
Sometimes you might wonder, "How'd they get here?" Well, I was searching for the original tune behind that song, "what's inside your butthole." and I found it.. It's The Offspring, "Can't get my head around you." and I let autoplay do it's thing and I'm impressed. Music is wonderful and refreshing. Keep on Rockin!
Damon, hold my whiskey please.
This song is like a whole opera in 6 minutes. I love it
This is better than Twilight OST.
Interview with a vampire part 2
Thank the gods they didn’t sparkle!! 😂
a r t .
dang! Paige is so lovely
Songs we listened to are bittersweet now Rip Michael ray skinner jr.  10/21/83-05/14/21
Love Ronnie and Saraya
In the next few years this fn banger has te be up 48M ! New generations get taught 🌬
This was honestly super emotionally difficult to listen to
He has such a beautiful voice, hes got amazing talent I’m always impressed with him
y donde están los putos guturales 🥺🥺
Can definitely here this in a movie
Brilliant 👏👏👏
wow. just.. Im in  complete awe. Seriously this is a fucking golden masterpiece.
I've listened to this so much, sometimes like 10 times in a row, and I never tire of it.
I'm a f*** that mother f*****
I enjoyed the original but this blows it out the water. Hopefully they do more songs like this in future
I listen to this Song when i feeling sick and the song ends it's feels damn good
Holy fuck dude
didn't like the original but this is incredible
It’s me or this sounds like a 007 theme <•>
Here's the better question who else realized that theres an Asian women playing the piano at one point because the cgi comes off her face?
Can we just talk about ronnies amazing vocals
I just can't. This is still the best sht I've ever seen...FK 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ronnie is probably the most versatile and talented singer I've ever listened to, period.
Ronnie, thank you for this. You're doing great, keep it up.
Man’s straight up became a cod zombie
I can't be the only one that still does a dramaticly sad "hi, Ronny...." to this version
Well, I'm not a vampire, but I feel like one Sometimes I sleep all day 'cause I hate the sunlight My hands are always shaking Body's always aching, and the dark is when I feed Well, I can lure any woman that I want to in my bed with me  And whiskey seems to be my holy water And mothers, better lock your doors and hide your daughters  'Cause I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold? For goodness sakes, where is my self-control? If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all hope  Well, I'm not a zombie, but I feel like one today Self-induced comatose, chemical daze My head is always spinning from this dizzy blurry vision and my stomach has had enough I feel like a lady that is pregnant with a baby 'cause I'm always throwing up  And hi, my name is Ronnie, I'm an addict And daddy should've never raised me on Black Sabbath  I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold? For goodness sakes, where is my self-control? If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all hope  When will you mortals believe? (He's not a vampire) I just want the world to bleed (He's not a vampire) Lust at the sight of your blood (He's not a vampire) I swear to God, I am not a... (He is not a...) (He is not a...)  So God bless all of you now 'Cause I'm going straight to Hell (Straight to Hell) And I'm taking you down with me Because you know damn well  So I sharpen my teeth 'cause I love the way it feels When I sink into your skin and draw the only thing that's real You don't believe me, should I write it in blood? You better drive that fucking stake right down my heart and try to run Motherfucker, I'm a vampire  And I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold? For goodness sakes, where is my self-control? If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all Heart has fucking lost all Heart has lost all hope (He's lost all hope) (He's lost all hope) All hope (He's lost all hope) My heart has lost all hope
warking hard with my new book with revamped in my head. Great.
The new Meatloaf! I’m okay with that. 🙏🏼🤘🏼❤️‍🔥🤘🏼
OMG...this is a BEAUTIFUL revamp.  Falling in Reverse...Ronnie, you have a great voice.  It's just so beautiful!!!
This reminds me of meatloaf and I mean that as a compliment
This is so fucking beautiful
I just noticed they edited out his tats I’ve watched this like 30 times and only noticed it now
This is the song my 6 year old requests, but he's adamant that THIS is the original lol
3:52 I don't know if that high note is a A#4.
Fucking perfection!!
When you run out of songs to write you try make a good song better and turn it to shit  haha
End of song.. “my heart.. has .. lost all hope” when he really puts his heart into that chorus.. gives me chills. Ronnie really has taken over my whole music genre. He has become my favorite artist period.
This is a masterpiece, both song and video. Can’t stop watching and listening 🖤
Eww.ill stick to the original thanks
This revamp feels like a vampire that has aged, seen many loss, grief, and remembering the foolish things he's done from a fresh vampire living the life in an eternal age, drinking, surrounded by girls, upbeat.. and then time goes on, still young, a bit of a change of looks to appear older, he grows tired yet surrounded by his reality of being a vampire and living that eternal life.
This song is enchanting. I'm drawn into it and I can feel the pain, the sadness, the anger, the loss of love... intertwined into one beautifully dark masterpiece. 🖤💋
Bela música fã brasileiro aq😁👌🏼
Ok i don't mind i prefer the other one better
If they ever make a the vampire lestat film, this needs to be in it!
Wow einfach nur wow. Er ist so talentiert! Ein Meisterwerk
Morbius was better
Гениально!
I found a Really Incredibly Beautiful (Female Cover) of this song that will leave you SPEECHLESS.  https://youtu.be/o7fEk0SKPHQ
I'm super impressed with every aspect of this music video.  The clarity, visual, and story line are near flawless.
That was some pretty Steven Segallian running.
no one ever said "im insane" in such a nice sounding way.
Is that Paige? 🤔
Очень крутой! Чертовски крут Рони!
this has to be one of my favorites
MASTERPIECE!!!!!!  OMG!!!!!!  WONDERFULL!!!!!!
OOOHH!! 💖💖💜💖💜💖💖💜💖💜
i'm not a vampire (remorbed)
Beautiful rendition but I can't really accept it that well, not really how it was written to be, as you could make out with the text. Maybe it's nostalgia for that old energetic version as well.
I'm sure I found my love! His voice, his mind, his soul. His videos and voice are so memorizing! I'm in a beautiful trans when I watch! I feel like I'm with him. He knows what he is doing! His daughter should be proud of her father!
Do you know the bit befoee God bless all of you bit is a reminder of MCR blood song 😂
This is absolutely amazing, I still prefer the original but I won’t deny how much of a masterpiece this is
Seeing this bands transformation through the years is crazy  Nice appearance by paige btw!
This Is Fuckin' A-R-T
I like this version better then the original ronnie you did it better this time around
EPIC
Bleach this man's hair and call him the Vampire Lestat!!!
Amazing voice
What a voice drama artistry ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
foarte reusit pentru mine ,emotionant BRAVO BAIETI
Seriously my favorite band since slipknot!!
Ну прям пиздец.
Damn
So you are not a revamped vampire? :D
Honestly was an epic song back in 2012 ronnie and the band killed it. But honestly i love this revamped version better cause its a mix off ballard, rock and they hit every note on the head this song is 1000/10 keep em coming guys 😊
THIS, FUCKING THIS!!!!!
I can never get enough of this song
Love this song, but have to stop at the end because the screaming kinda ruins it for me lol.
His voice is AMAZING!!! This song is an absolute MASTERPIECE!!!
Epic. 🖤
nie som priaznivec tohto druhu muziky, ale čo som videl videoklipy tak mám dojem, že to robia s obrovskou vášňou. To v dnešnej dobe povrchnosti veľmi oceňujem. Klobúk dolu.
this is so fucking cringe
Hi, my name is Dina, I'm an addict... to your music! 🎶  Damn dude... 😱😱 perfection! 👏👏 You should definitely come to Greece...
I wish he would do more reimagined versions of his songs he has such a beautiful voice filled with so much emotion. He's a true artist.
Epic
*CJ Voice* ah shit here we go again *heats up hair straightener*
I mean, sure. Except that, the original is my favorite song from them. This is great...but kind of unnecessary. Maybe in a Broadway musical, or something. Idk. He should've just left this song alone. Just my opinion.
I’m sorry but some parts with the lyrics just made me laugh. I’m sure the majority of you know which ones I’m talking about.
this is to good to be true!
This is fucking EPIC!!!
do the jabbed become vampires?
Ronnie Radke, you have a lot of respect for your art to the song and talent, continue in this spirit.

Ffs, my bestfriends daughter played popular monster for me. Took us a while to figure it all out. Same kid God me on this shit. Adore the old shit. Also - love this shit.
I don’t even know what to say. This is mind boggling.
очень мощно и круто !
This is amazing
" mother fucker, I'm a vampire!!!"
The original song was okay but this version and the movie are a masterpiece! (Yes, I consider this a short movie, not a music video.)
God damn this is epic af
And this is what i call art
you better drive thAT FUCKING STAKE RIGHT THROUGH MY HEART AND TRY TO RUN!!!! MOTHERFUCKEEER!!! I"M A VAMPIIREEEEEE!!!!!
It gives me chills! Musical, lyrical  and direction masterpiece 🎶 It’s so good there should be a movie on the basis of this music video 😭🔥😍 “Blood is life” 🧛🏻‍♂️
I just love this presentation, and it's definitely going to be on my Playlist
Minha banda emo favorita 🫶🏼
that gave me goosebumps
I just can't stop listening to this and to the drug in me is reimagined, what a work of art its just amazing  Ronnie's vocals are better than ever, this range is outstanding
Wasted rez
Bruh I'm getting chills. Definitely better than the original
Tbh it’s not that bad
I like how it starts off with "im not a vampire" and by the end he is like "IM A FUCKING VAMPIRE!"
So epic 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰.
04:53 *POV: Your playing League of Legends as Vladimir and enemy team 5v1 you in midlane*
is this a joke
Omg 😳
no
Im sad boys i need help
Professor Snape, stop daydreaming about slytherin winning house cup.
Miss you, Derek. RIP you fucking legend. I feel you in all the songs, even when you're not there. 💚💚💚
This is a masterpiece and the video is like a movie ronnie always does something amazing and that actress that was with him did fantastic also its good to see her in a different way then putting somebody in a submission in the squared circle
Is this not the equivalent of a modern opera? If Ronnie wrote operas, and sang them too, I would watch them.
Just beautiful, I grew up listening to classic Ronnie and recently had an though to check what's up?  This is doooooopppe, really art, really progressive.  Actually unbelievable Ronnie will have to die with one of the greatest legacy of the 21st century music   Remarkable 😄
Ronnie sings with So Much Passion!! Amazing Vocals 🧛‍♂🧛‍♂🖤🖤❤❤
What a fucking masterpiece !!!
That choir made this epic.
“revamped” Nice pun
Clearly a vampire dairies fan
This is pure art. And Ronnie is an artist.
HOLY FRICKIN SHIT THIS IS AWEKING SO MUCH EMOTIONS IN ME <3
É lindo e intenso ao mesmo tempo!
Il cappello davvero
sheesh, two weeks without therapy and I feel this one way too much...
Juste incroyable
Só isso foi melhor que morbius inteiro
Ronnie do be morbin tho
Whiskey is my holy water.  Well, I am not sure how to reply to this.
Holy shit
The more I listen to this the more I appreciated the utter brilliance of this composition!!!
I like theatrical flair of this version! I'd pay to see a musical like this
Was that Rebecca black?
What the hell is this
Was a washing machine going while you were recording this? Is that why it's so bad because you couldn't hear the music?
You are bad at making music
Canciones parecidas que me recomienden???
Perfect!
Can someone let me know if he's actually a pos? I've heard so many things and tbh felt like he still had an immature mindset last time I checked like 2 or 3 years ago. This sounds amazing but really not into supporting harmful artists.
Maggott
Yo.mmm
lyrics are pretty messed up adrenochrome much?
ronnieeee te amoooooooooo
I just wanna say OMG ITS GREAT AF
I really hope Ronnie is doing okay.
OBRA PRIMA
Revamped lol

his voice is chefs kiss
Going through such a shit time. Glad I found this band but idk. Can't stand this life anymore.
Thats just fucking amazing!
What a fucking masterpiece
Not me thinking how PERFECT Ronnie would be as a evil Vampire Diaries as like a friend of klaus or something. Possibly even being on of the Originals.
I love that he put Paige as his Queen in this video. The added ending & lyrics are something else. I’ve been bumping Ronnie & friends since the Fate days. So sorry about Derek Ronnie. I lost my brother & my girlfriend to dope. Death, love, drugs & music are 4 of the most powerful things in our existence. They shape us into who we eventually become. Excellent song. Superb video. & even most impressive your stamina in the business Ronnie. You’ve come a long way. R.I.P Derek. 💜
So many Phantom of the Opera vibes. I love this so much. I went back & listened to the original version of this song since I never knew it, & it's ok but this is so much better & more mature. The music really matches the emotions & intensity of the lyrics & it shows off Ronnie's voice much better. And the video is way more epic too. Great work!
caralho irmão, vai dar uma estudada, mds do ceu, parece que cagou essa musica.
Masterpiece!
You're not a vampire, but they are among us.
The first version and this one, they go along so accurate in time and with our ages. How a masterpiece turns into a better masterpiece through the years?…This band is capable of do that 🤘and thensome.
so dramatic
...and they haven't paid me yet!
ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVS
I am also an addict Ronnie, I am addicted to this song. It is exquisite and I thank you.
Between his voice and the video holy fuck!  Absolutely fucking incredible!! 10 out 10!!!
try to test him,?
dark shadows, the film
it's about johnny depps movies dark shadows
next song I'm not a vampire
he loved the girl that was on the cliff and he jumped and became a vampire
dark shadows
Se me erizo la piel
Damn
This man is so talented, he even looks like a vampire😌
I’d love to see a musical movie like this! This song is literally a movie within itself! Love it!
Currently spam watching all of The videos I apparently never knew existed and just, pure talent
Mf that was amazing!
I have seen this video millions of times and it still makes me so sad that he brings her back to life just in time to watch him get murdered and ultimately to have her take her life again. What insane writing for such an amazing song and video! Side note, I am preggo and my little guy kicks me good every time I listen to this. He already has stellar taste in music! haha
Its truly a masterpiece
Twin flames wouldn't have it any other way then die together. I am right here where are you. J.p / E.B
Как же ты прекрасен, мой симфо-металл-рэпер !!!!!
Dude that's paige
When...when did I become so cold
This is way better than I thought it would be.
Wtf is this
sleep is a must daughters Is a must go ahead and give me your best
HATE this version LOVE the OG !!!
Ok Ronnie.. im calling you out because i cant hold it back anymore I haven't seen one video of you singing this song live so how in the hell are we supposed to know you can actually sing this bub, not saying that you cqnt because im a fan to the end, but its a little unfair man please i think alot of people would agree i know you can do it!!! And we'd love to see and hear it
Is she Paige from wwe??? WTF
such a masterpiece..
Okay this shit hittin maybe yall emos aint losers 🤣🤣🤤
Who is she???
this is art ..literal art
this is 1000X better then the original,  it make more sense
Epic song and video!
Well, what are we then? We live of the history of the dead.
Чем больше смотрю этот клип и слушаю эту музыку, тем больше они мне нравятся 🥰😍
I could watch a musical comedy  Written by Ronnie !!   Or a musical TV show !!   That would be crazy cool
cada ves que escucho esta canción me recuerda al mahwna de noblesse
I think these reimagined songs work so well because they are a complete contrast to the originals. I never listened to them back in the day, I actually heard these versions before the originals. The lyrics fit so much better with this kind of tone/mood. To me, the originals seem more like a fun lighthearted cover of THIS song. Very interesting perspective.
0:32 OMG it's Paige
The chills this gives me.
that d5 he hits right near the end was mindblowing 🤯🤯
So I think the version of her that burns at the end was the part of her that pulled up with his BS so when he finally left her life she was freed from the abusive relationship.
Please do a whole musical, I’d watch it live!!
This https://youtu.be/XSfMCqcHFmQ is what happened.. ✌🏼#ThaDose
Anyone know who the woman is? She's gorgeous!
Absolutely amazing song and vid
Masterpiece
Жесть, конечно…Снято просто нереально круто, мурашки и правда по коже, как уже кто-то тут писал!!! Эмоции после увиденного, лучше чем после просмотра многих голливудских фильмов! Браво 🙌  Стоя аплодирую 👏
its kinda like doing a slow cover of hot for teacher. whats the point lol?
Damn ronnie...
Well Im not retarded but I feel like one
This song is epic. Its amazing and hits so many sweet aspects of all music. I could listen to it for hours.
Holy shit that was good lol
"I FEEL like a lady that is... PREGETWITHABABY"    😂😂😂
5:13 I could play that on loop all day
its amazing how they turned these heavy songs into these piano masterpieces
You made me cry again
Not bad. Still like the OG more
It´s not a song - It's a very fine painting
i like it
No one music has ever hit me like Ronnie’s music and remakes
plot twist: he is, in fact, a vampire.
Hermosa obra de arte.✨
Talk about a remaster. This was awesome!
WTF WOW
The instrumental gives me some Ramin Djawadi vibes.
Tommorow is the death day of derek jones rest in peace :3 (21 april 2020) age 35
Loving these reimaged, vamped and whatever versions. I wish more artists would do them :)
Tá aqui o comentário br que você tava procurando
The cinematography in this video is amazing. This could easily be adapted into a movie. I haven't seen a decent Vampire movie since Interview with a Vampire. And after movies like Twishite severely neutered vampire movies, a movie like this could be just what the genre needs to revamp it. Pun not intended. And Paige is perfect to play the role.
Saraya is so lucky
cinematic masterpiece
No words ... Just pure talent .. RR
This man is not just a rocksrar; he is a composer, director and all around gift to us.
Damn. No matter how many times I hear this song, I want to hear it again, and again! Every time I listen to it, this masterpiece gets me right in the feels, every time! It is gorgeous, it is intense, it is masterful, it is fucking brilliant! I love it!
Roni, can you cover surface pressure?
A modern, gothic Bohemian Rhapsody. Genuine art a lot of modern music could learn from.
I hope Ronnie will read this at some point but, this is by far my favorite version.  The respect that you deserve is unfathomable, you have come a long way and it shows in your knowledge for music.  Not only did your voice adapt but you also improve the pronunciation of your lyrics to be more clear when singing.  This song will be played over and over by me for sure and maybe one day I'll show my kids and grandkids the legend of my times music.  My dad did the same with: "kiss, Metallica, ext."
That was way more than i was expecting. Nice.
Wow this is one if not the best short clip i had ever watched !!!! Master piece
No tenía idea que esta versión existía, pero todo el video quede :OOO
WOWWOWWOWWOWWOW!!!
He lost his "something", didn't he?
Why nobody talks about the reference of The Phantom of The Opera?????
Wow, just wow. It is incredible.
You're so fucking talented Ronnie.
this version is soooo much better than the original. simply awesome
I like the original, but this is a master piece! So emotional, I loved. The original for dance and this for reflection.
Severus Snape does really make good music!
Holy fuck nuggets BATMAN that was good!!!!
You deserve all the damn Grammies for years to come. You are the Fucking Man!!!!
vote for ronni to participate in a vampire movie
An absolute masterpiece. I can definitely not get enough of this!
Omg... Totally different feel... Omg. U have matured. No longer rebel and feel remorse. Much better version!!!  I'm shivering...
Holy shit Ronnie is super fucking talented this gave me music chills fr
amazing revamp(ire)
Nunca es tarde para conocer a tu grupo favorito 🖤
ЕБАААААТЬ ПЕСЕНКА ЖОСКАЯ 🏳️‍🌈🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵
This is a sad but beautiful song about addiction and what it does to the person who has been tortured by being addicted to anything self-destructive. I have so much respect for anyone who has, and has found the strength to draw themselves out and put the drugs or whatever it is away, and march onward with their lives! I love you and am praying for you to soldier on and not relapse. Much love.
I swear i got goosebumps watching this
Man this sht is lame Ronnie is at his best when he's not giving a F and trying to fuq females.
Listening to Revamped/Reimagined vs the OG's since they've been out, just proves how serious of an artist Ronnie has always been.  He has said it himself, he is a lyrical genius, and the king of the music scene. After all, the only way to Fall in Reverse is to go up!  I would love to hear more of their old songs done like this, but if Zombiefied is only a peek of the new album, then I'll be happy either way!
this gave me chills I loved it sm
How have I not listened to this song just now. It's aboustly beautiful ❤️
THIS IS FUCKING LEGENDARY
honestly teary eyed this turned out so beautiful!!
But im a vampire
Fuckikg incredible
I have no words but bravo.
This is art
MERDE ! a 53 balais je tombe sur ce mec et ...grosse claque ! que c'est bon ! 1 heure que je saigne ses titres , révélation ! clip d'une qualité ! comme quoi a tout age ont découvre ! quel kif !
This is the best revamp ever
If it's revamped after all this years , title should be changed to "I am Not Sus Vampire"
su voz es un volcan
2:39
i think we should check on ronnie
God dam!
damn where the fuck have i been. I just heard FIR stuff and this song hit hard. I feel this way!!
Damn Ronnie aged like fine wine
I'm surprise how Ronnie is not an actor: He's presence is amazing. A mix beetween Cristopher Walken and Michael Keaton.
This is seriously one of the most beautiful pieces of music I've ever heard. An absolute masterpiece in every way.
reVAMPed
THIS RIGHT HERE.  IS A MASTERPIECE.
Bin durch Zufall auf Ronnie&dieses Wahnsinnsvideo&dem Hammersong gestossen, als ich über die ex-wrestlerin paige-seine damalige/jetzige  freundin-gelesen habe. Ich liebe Vampire wie ihn, absolut nicht die jungs von twilight, sorry.
This song seriously sounded so weird to me the first time I heard it, it was almost cheesy to me. But something kept calling me back, I had to really  embrace the lyrics and the way it sounded, and now I fucking love this song
i think situations in this style would be cool
This is probably the video I'd show someone to show his vocal capabilities.
My name's Vlad, and I am NOT a vampire... Totally
Watching this several times now I’m trying to figure out who that girl is. I’ve seen her in wwe someone I watched who reacted to this thinks it’s Paige. But I’m not 100% sure.
It's 2022 and I'm still waiting for the musical tour and musical album of his songs.
holy shit a year already ?? seems like yesterday this came out
his look's like another reincarnation of loki
Fxxk that raw emotion in those screams... wish he'd revamp every song he has! :P
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
I def.would not fight being under Ronnie's spell.
I just found out about this today I- i thought he only did one reimagined song I-
And hi my name is Loki
Best music video award goes to...
Whiskey is my holy water.  Well, I am not sure how to reply to this.
Wtf I barely found out today that this version of the song existed
Wow i have no words ....
Holy fucking shit
Ronnie é um gênio mas é totalmente totó das ideia
3:24 is the best part holy shit
This sounds like an ending to a vampire drama movie and this just plays in the script
Damn ronnies slower songs slap
Damn Ronnie’s slower songs slap
is something off ?
Wow... this is gorgeous and amazing...
great silent acting to WWE Superstar Paige
It's crazy how insanely different 2 different versions of the same song can be, like this compared to the original is vaaaastly different, it's practically 2 completely different songs that both use the same lyrics lol
What the fuck happen to Ronnie!? He just took Evan-whatever he name is and drug her through the mud.  Fuck night wish. Who the hell let him get his god mode on? Please do something with Hostile Grooves.
Almost 10 M Views  at least 1 M it’s me…. I hope YouTube not gonna drop me
Thanx falling in reverse for  making this song
This song helps me wen I'm doin so I play it I'm a hug fan I love this song
Absolutely amazing, powerful song. Literally gives me goosebumps everytime I listen to it. Ronnie you are a true artist and damn if this doesn't make you a million times hotter 😍
No words can discribe this masterpiece 😍 I cry every time I get to the end of it, the emotions in this video are transcending the screen
Me a monster?  I am only what you made me.
🖤
I thought she was Rebecca Black at first...
Paige looks amazing
DAMN!! This is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🚒👨‍🚒
I'm not a vampire re*vamp*ed
Remix of metal songs. Hmm
plot twist: ronnie hasnt peaked
I'm just gonna say it, this video and song lives rent free in my head forever. God damn
nothing will beat the original
So dramatic. That's art.
GOD DAMN! That was the best thing I have heard/watched in a LONG time!
I am so obsessed with this. Ronnie's vocals are incredible. He's come so far.
Hello God. Ronnie here, Im here to take the head seat. K thanks.
you fell off L + ratio
What's the misterious beauty of this woman!
This shit has helped me through rehab a musical would be awesome
How come this is the first time I listen to this? Song is awesome and video heavily rocks.
OMG!!! His voice is what makes all these songs even more special 💕💕
I've been a Ronnie's fan for more than a decade listening to since ETF days :D
Masterpiece
Absolutely epic!!!!!
I cant listen to this song in public because it makes my eyes well up its so fucking good.
My 7 year old daughter says daddy should of not raise me on falling in reverse rather then Black Sabbath 😆
Only recently got into Falling in Reverse and this is one of my favorite songs, incredible vocals with such range and emotion.
Love ronnie but this is corny
Wow I’m speechless 🤘🏻🙌🏻🍷
Is it just me or does anyone else think this would sound amazing with Axel Rose as a duet?
I'm glad he found his voice eventually.
He needs to do bad girls club I can so see it slow motion deep singing
I'm ready for falling in reverse on ice
Hi Ronnie still smashing it all the way from all of us in fucking Scotland were ur real fans are
I seriously wanna see him and Danny filth collab. Please turn this in to a full on movie!
Sorry prefer the original totally too weird so slow x
God damn man, that was amazing. Keep on the right path.
Still in awe
i bet Ronnia is Dio
the talent this man has absolutely beautiful!
This was so powerful. This 56 year old is becoming a fan. Wow
For a song that some might have said was just recreating something he had done previously due to a lack of creativity or originality, the amount of raw power that is pulled out here more than quashes that challenge.
it cost a lot of money
meh, not a fan of this
I feel like i just watched a Horror movie, fucking awesome!
i'm total in love with this song i listen everyday and everytime <3 amazing
Ronnie's been a vampire here and in zombified he's a zombie can't wait what's next
Please more like this.This gave me goose bumps. f#+_#$+ amazing
Its Art.
The best, heroes don't always wear capes.. Salute, Ronnie
• • • • • chills. I got chills three times. Wow Ronnie your music videos are so powerful now! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Where did u flim this ur back yard?
I can't stop laughing
WTF lol
Idk why but the scene where the police question him at the front door is hella funny.
I accidentally clicked on this song yesterday, actually wanting to listen to the original and I'm so happy my fat finger clicked on it! WOW! I haven't heard Ronnie's voice in a while! He improved so much!!! 🔥
I hope Ronnie stays with the new artistry and style of capturing the essence deeper like this... revamping a vampire song... is pretty cool haha.
I DIDNT KNOW HE COULD DO VOCALS LIKE THIS FUUUUCCKKK
Ever time I hear one of the revamped songs I can imagine ballets and lyrical dance. I'd pay to see how people interpret their emotions and a story with this music.
Wow! 😩🤌
I would literally sell my sould to listen to this live
2:40-2:43 💀
What a fucking masterpiece. Literally chills.
Wow that was emotional. I don't know if I watched a music video or just watched a tragic movie or opera theater. Very good.
The girl is page, right? Wwe superstar
Ronnie ♥
I just realised how fucked this song is... In a good way.
Wow... just wow.... i remember when i heard the first version... THIS IS WHY I WILL ALWAYS LOVE THIS BAND!!! Beautifully done!!
This is STUNNING
MASTERPIECE!
why am i crying omg this was so beautiful
Hello from Montréal !!  It’s a beautiful song, I do love opera and that Voice : oh my goodness  We love you
Clear and nice instruments also the vocal
This Was PHENOMENAL !!! Ronnie's voice is Spectacular as usual !!! WOW
Snape?
Aro lookin a lil good here 🦇
Dude for real i agree if they made a falling in reverse musical I would do anything to see that.
Well, I just crapped myself...
Holy.. non pun intended... shit.....
There kidnapping my family and setting us up and trying to kill us so I've been doing the worst of the worst them and have been running there life and managed to get them cut up and hit and also have been running the highest rank of military hits and presidential
Бывают исполнители после которых не знаешь кого слушать потому что переплюнул всех , и рэперов, и вокалистов , как теперь жить 😊
Your creativity is on a whole new level man..
My heart has lost all hope 🥺
F*cking masterpiece!!
He’s looks so handsome in this. I don’t know if it’s the hair but he looks younger.  The girl gave me the Christine vibe from The Phantom of the Opera (2004).  “Hi, my name is Ronnie. I’m an addict.” *I’m not even an addict to anything yet that hit hard for some reason.*
Oh my God!!!!!!!! I have been almost rendered completely speechless. All I can say is Oh my God over and over. That was so unexpected. It literally brought me to tears. I went on an emotional journey and it was beautiful.
I was literally mouth open the entire time! This was epic!!!
Literally copying Palaye Royale in multiple scenes here
Perfection
This would be an amazing musical!
Every time I listen this song I'm covered head to foot on Goosebumps..... This song goes above a Classic. More reworkings of your songs please Ronnie.
This is absolutely spectacular!! 🖤
Suffering from depression and addiction. this song hits so hard and is so unbelievable beautiful at the same time. ronnie, the band, everything is phenomenal
This sits right below Meatloaf's I'd Do Anything For Love.
Wow 😳 this was amazing definitely on the edge of my seat the whole song what an amazing song
Crazy thing is, this song equally means the same to those who suffer from depression, as addiction.
Is it just me or does vampire Ronnie Radke remind you of Severus Snape lol he should play Snape in a Harry Potter Prequel
My god...
oh my GOD this is so EPIC. how have i not heard of this band before?!
i aciddent paused at 1:45 and i was like wait a min he look different at the frame lol
Fuck yeah bro I got your back !!!! Fuck the corrupt elites. They are going down. We are going through hell trying. But we will win. Don't give up. Much love brothers and sisters. God bless
Bravo Bravo
pov elder scrolls vampire
Damn... That version is just epic...
Absolutely awesome 👌
He was once a part of the volturi
Wow his voice is soo goodddd
Emo rebel to refine goth gentleman
That was absolutely amazing
Musical
Why am I crying
One Year. Memento Mori.
why is this so addictive?
Can’t stop listening to this song. Hi my name is Justin I’m a addict 🤣
Can someone please fuckin explain to me what a vampire is.. v scared that I am one, just say yes if so to make it easier to respond to :/
I wont listen to the original now
My goodness what a voice!!
Damn
This MV was better than every Vamp movie of the last 10 years..
Pls re make phantom of the opera.
Wow this is my first time hearing this song and holy crap it's so amazing!! How have I missed such a masterpiece!!! And the visual story telling...damn that got me good!! Ronnie Radke is a story telling genius
This is a masterpiece, I always comeback to watch ❤❤
IM FUCKING SPEECHLESS
Man. Ronnie got me crying on a Wednesday morning. God damn lol
I'm just here for Paige. Chester bennington will be so proud of this masterpiece
This isn't just a song, it's a masterpiece. This is why we need MTV back.
That was meh...
I know it's not his new songs re-done but zombified reanimated would be a great title...
Woah!!
Ronnie is my god. He is pure TALENT.
your songs are wonderrful i love you
What is this type of music that I’m falling in love it
I…….I……..I………..am in love.
This song made me so depressed..  Cos my friend, well old friend showed me this band and I'm kinda in the middle of either losing them or getting them back. And they won't talk to me either so.. depressing songs are my answer
the vibes..... immaculate
And Daddy should have never raised me on Black Sabbath ;)  Freaking AWESOME
Ronnie is so fucking talented so amazing
Spotify?? We need this on spotify
Somebody's been watching Interview With The Vampire.
Who am I? Am I a christian? What does that mean?  who do I represent?  Ive been so sick, sick inside and sick of being alive  Fame is admonishing  It is exhausting  Is God out there?  If he is than why dont I feel forgiven yet?  I feel lost!  All alone in my own debt that I cannot repay  I dont deserve this thing called salvation  This book you have your people read, does it really do anything!  Im honest? What does it mean to be honest?  Does it mean im a judgemental horrible person or does it make me a hero Do my faults being apparent make me a human  or a monster?   I wondered these same things! But when I started thanking God for everything that has made me who I am, i came to closure and was able to accept salvation!  I started by writing... I am thankful I......  learned to read and write and I thanked God for my mom who made me a reader and a writer and I wrote down all the good and then all the bad! I thanked God because Im still alive and my pain made me who I am and it brought me to a more humble, peaceful place!   Schizophrenia is a curse and then its a blessing cause there are things that happen to your brain when you overthink on everything. Your critical thinking is boosted and you are very humble to the point of breaking in prayer which the bible says   "if my people who are called by my name will humble themeselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then they will hear from heaven and I will heal their land" psalms 86:11-12  Humbling yourself is being honest that your faulty, human and you need help to see the light before your lose your life to a pill bottle and a shot of whiskey in a cup!  I knew a lot about the bible and very little about the power of God! in my teens and 20's I felt stupid and I faught my own disease of pain and I had a hard time until last year I found that Gods healing is an everyday occurence that takes faith and endurance and is full of trials, your life can be revived spontaneously or you can die and slowly come back to a place of freedom again!  As a child I always thought "he can do it for them, he can heal others but hes selective and wont help me" I believed that my whole life, Then I found I was wrong! I found His grace is sufficient and things may not happen when I demand them too but he always comes through! Ive lived through hell fire 10 times! Im still here!
The first time I watched this I was like "Ew wtf why'd he ruin such a good song from my teen years!"      This is my 8th time watching it. Today. My opinion has changed a little.
Это теперь моя любимая песня , спасибо , что переиздали )
This music video is just ✨gender✨
Классно, напоминает My Chemical Romance, обожала эту группу
I don't know if I like their original version of this song or this version better. Both are pretty good
This song makes almost every other song not sound as good now. So much emotion and beautiful character development throughout the lyrics. Denial, anger, depression, self destruction, and acceptance while using a vampire as a metaphor for feeling dead inside from drugs messing up his brain chemistry. Absolutely beautiful
BRAVO BRAVO - CHILLLLLLLS
Dude I LOVE THIS MASTERPIECE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ok avenged sevenfold
I can’t believe I never new about this it’s so beautiful how it captures the gothic romance with such little time simply a beautiful reimagining!
i like your songs
I love how Paige is in this video
I love how Paige is in this video
Espectacular. Es lo mejor que he escuchado en mucho tiempo!
OMG!!! That was pretty awesome.
KEEP BEING AMAZON BRO YOU GOT A FAN FOR LIFE OUT OF ME
Ronnie learned piano and went wild. Good J
Ronnies vocals are so fucking raw in this. My mind is blown. As usual.
She came back to life just to die again.....what
This song is so cool, that a minute in I had to stop it and I said fuck this, this is too good. Nah I really like this song, I think I was born a Vampire, I'm cool like that.
i wish this would never end
💞💞💞💞
💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞
Ahhh, mmmm there's my man, hehe, my actual guy im with looks just like him, but matt is younger, last listened to this 6 months ago, when I was stuck in lockdown with his family, and still live there, atm I'm at my best friend home since 3 Saturdays ago, here till 28th Feb, then my Andy look alike picks me up, lol
This man is a genius!!! Such a beautiful reconstruction of an old favorite!!!
i cried. so hard.
WHAT THE HELL WAS THIS MASTERPIECE?
Kinda feel lied too now just finding it it wasn't you on the piano but hey
Do more versions like this please, This is a masterpiece
i love it! 💕
Can't believe I just discovered this. This dude is a legend. Absolute masterpiece and his vocals are unreal. I never fail to get goose bumps every time I hear this.
Wow
what the f*ck it's almost been a year since this was released?!
I'm a new fan of falling in reverse! And all I can say I ABSALOUTY LOVE the songs makes my heart pound! Makes me feel so alive!
Malah baru denger direvamp nya selama 11 bulan, kemana saja saya. Malah makin sakit setelah di revamp keren
Do caught like a fly
I cannot express how much I love this, and how unbelievable Ronnie's voice is. He's impressed the living sh*t outta me, and is now forever among my top 3 favorite musicians of all time, all genres, EVER.
The beginning of this song sounds A LOT like NF’s “Intro”
So.....FUCKIN.....LEGENDARY!!!
meudeus tudo nesse clipe é lindo
Whisky seems to be my holy water

Jesse James West got me here
I have a woman in my tree with the name Marie Antoinette... I have to look to find her last name!  that lived in the 16-1700's and she was born in america but her father and mother were born in europe!  This video is based my the story of mozart which obviously he can relate to. She didnt marry mozart and he drunk himself to death and it wasnt enought so he killed over with a dose of rat poison which was made from poison ivy a cousin of the north american marijuana weed!  I know what its like to have an inferno of coal where my heart should be whole! Its difficult I look content, cute and happy but I cant seem to find what heals me and its killing me!
They need to do like some sort of mini movie musical with their music it would be amazing
I gotta watch this ATLEAST once a day  ♡♡♡   I'm in love with this song so much along with ur others but fukkkk .  Release more musiccc!
Man I love this
2:25 goes hard
xd
Genius.
“Well I’m not a vampire, but I feel like one. Sometimes I sleep all day cause I hate the sun…light. My hands are always shaking, body’s always aching and the dark is when I feed. Well I can lure any woman that I want to in my bed…with me. And whiskey seems to be my holy water. And mothers better lock your doors and hide your daughters…  Cuz I’m insane. I can feel it in my bones. Coursing through my veins. When did I become so cold? For goodness sakes, where is my self control? If home is where the heart is then my heart has lost all hope!  Well I’m not a zombie but I feel like one. Today’s self-induced, comatose, chemical daze! My head is always spinning from this physical revision and my stomach has had enough. I feel like a lady that is pregnant with a baby cuz I’m always throwin’ up! And ‘Hi, my name is Ronnie. I’m an addict”. And daddy should have never raised me on Black Sabbath!  I’m insane! I can feel it in my bones! Coursing through my veins. When did I become so cold? For goodness sakes, where is my self control? If home is where the heart is then my heart has lost all hope!  When will you mortals believe? (He’s not a vampire) I just want the world to bleed! (He’s not a vampire) Lust at the sight of your blood (He’s not a vampire) I swear to God, I am not a… (He is not a…)  So God bless all of you now! Cause I’m going straight to hell. And I’m taking you down with me! Because you know damn well…  So I sharpen my teeth, cuz I love the way it feels, when I sink into your skin and draw the only thing that’s real.  You don’t believe me. Should I write it in blood? You better drive that f*cking stake right through my heart and try to run!  Motherf*cker! I’m a vampire!  CUZ I’M INSANE!  I CAN FEEL IT IN MY BONES!  COURSING THROUGH MY VEINS!  WHEN DID I BECOME SO COLD?!  FOR GOODNESS SAKES!  WHERE IS MY SELF CONTROL! IF HOME IS WHERE MY HEART is then my heart has lost all… HEART HAS F*CKING LOST ALL… HEART HAS LOST ALL HOPE! All hope. My heart has lost all hope…
This song makes me cry every damn time man. Fuck
Yes lm 13 en l lm a vampier Boy
This dude needs his own musical. 🖤🖤🖤
Haha now i sleep with a vampire. Who really understands...zzźzzz
Missed a trick not calling it “I’m not a (re)vampire”
Can we get a remake of “Interview with a Vampire” staring Ronnie 👏🏻
Paige looks great in this.
This is the greatest song ever, love the story. Ronnie is really powerful man.
Ronnie doesn't makes music videos he makes movies.
this gives me interveiw with the vampire vibes i was telling myself "why does ronnie look so different" bruh i just realized his face tats were covered. lmaoo
first time i heard this song I fell in love and immediately bought it, and im still listening to it over and over. Popular Monster, I'm Not A Vampire Revamped, and now Zombified are the top songs in my playlist, such an amazing bandd! And the videos are all awesommeeee!!
How am I just now finding out that this is a thing
This is the difference between a musician and a masterful entertainer.
Absolute genius!!!!.....Geez what a ride it was with all the emotions through the song. AMAZING!!! Love FIR.
Godammn im crying
Good but for me old version is better
This song has" in fear and faith" vibes
Take you down with me because you know damn well I'm bringing you back to hell and hell we will have fun when you know damn well then hell you will never burn The Sun Will always Love you the day and night and day and night
The home is where you're at in your heart still has a soul
Believe you you don't have to write it in blood I know your vampire and so am I
The sharpen his teeth he knows the way it feels he loves the way he feels he turns into his girlfriend and gives him his blood to make her friends forever more
Taking them down with them because they know them well
So God was special due to know I'm taking you straight to hell and there's where we will know
When will those mortars understand he just wants him to believe
If your heart is when you're adding your heart has to soul so you have a soul
Mommy and daddy should never raise me up this Way because I'm insane and I went in through my veins
Hi my name is Yesenia and I am anorexic
I am pregnant like a woman who's always throwing up
So I indulge in the things I like to indulge, toes feeling it so road for good and say where was myself control
Well I'm not a son being I don't feel like one but I'm a fairy and I know that I'm one
For good and sakes where did I become so cold for you're on my drug and you are my ecstasy
Cuz I'm insane I know it through my bones and I know it through those veins
In mother's better lock their doors and hide their sons cuz I'm insane I can feel it in my brain I'm insane I go through through my veins I'm insane I could feel it down my veins
Water tends to be my sacred water whiskey tends to be your sacred drink
Well he can learn any woman in bed instead in me
And is always quaking my hand will always shake because I feel that I need I do
Sometimes I sleep all day because I can't stand the light sometimes I stay outside because I love the Sun
Well I'm a vampire and I feel like going I'm not a son but I'm not that one maybe I'm a fairy and I am one
He reminds me of Edward Scissorhands
One of the most underrated masterpieces on this planet!!
Evolution at its finest

Great Tragedy of dark souls...😭
Epic
Just 3:45 to 4:23... OH MY LORD! Greatest demonstration of his vocals and gives me chills every single time. It feels like you've watched a whole damn movie in minutes and will leave you speechless but wanting to say so much. I love this so much, it's beautiful.
Dude...WHAT? I am Speechless. Not what i expectet at all (in a good way)

This track gives me Goosebumps everytime I play it. Pure Masterpiece...
that scream at 5:42 gives me the chills everytime
So we need a power ballad of all falling in reverse songs.
Yo. This shit is on another level. This isn't a music video and they're not just musicians. They're.....Musideo....It's a fucking experience bitches. Prepare to live.
Jesus Ronnie you have  become  a God amongst  men the songs you write and  the videos to them are pure ecstasy  to the ears and eyes!
Прекраснейший клип и исполнение! Ронни идеален
Почему никто не отмечает его актерского мастерства? Очень круто передал эмоции! I'm in love)
This is beautiful, how did I just see this!? 💕
Much better!
I've been listening to Zombified for the past couple days and it brought me back to this video. I can not explain the emotions portrayed through Ronnie's voice lately. It's like you almost know when/what he's going through at certain points in the recording. When I first heard the news of Jones passing it really hurt because I knew how much of an impact FIR has left on me. Then this song came out and I swear I felt the moment Ronnie was thinking about Jones. Then Zombified came out and now all I can think about is Twitter and various news outlets lol!!
Hey Ronnie, “Eat a Snikers Bar bro.” Your not yourself when you’re hungry 🤨
Gawd Damn. I never thought I’d find myself liking Opera/Play style music? But DAMN IT, this band got me going down a rabbit hole
I can't believe how many people think she dies at the end but it is her outer body self that burns. She is still in transition on the couch when he dies. Love how he sacrifices himself for her but sad at the same time.
oh hi mark  ronnie is really looking a lot like tommy wiseau nowadays.
The goosebumps I get Everytime I play this song is just crazy
Favored
❤️ Falling in Reverse  Ronnie's voice is Magical.... It's really so beautiful and also how he puts so much emotion into it... And the changes Ronnie does in different parts of this song is soo amazing.... ❤️❤️❤️
holy fucking shit.
This gives me Meatloaf I would do anything for love but I won't do that vibes
Just doesn't hold the same release feeling. It's nice. But I prefer the original
First rock and roll Ronnie and now classical Ronnie and soon to come theater Ronnie Radke
iconic
Sounds amazing 👊👊👊
Goosebumps😱😱😱😱
Ugh the chills that I have the last 2 minutes of the song
Wow that actually really deep... for anyone who doesn't know Derek Jones was the Guitarist of Falling in Reverse and he died in 2020 only a few months after his fiance lost her battle with cancer. I haven't looked any further into the circumstance or cause of his death. But I in part suspect he died of "Heartache" as they'd say in the olden days.
Quel chef d'oeuvre !
We KNOW ronnie was so into his character 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Speechless 😶
Dude, wait, no ?! Is that really Ronnie?
Dude running that is a beautiful song man beautiful I feel your pain bro I feel it you got some deep dark paint inside of you bro and just let it out man let it out with the music but I feel it would you bro 100% this video is awesome your song is beautiful man
Can he really deal with it on live? The older he gets, the better he sings omg!
His voooooice damn Ronnie can sing! 🔥
That voice!!!
Open for Jordan Peterson...
I swear this song is different than it was in 2021!! I swear I can hear new noises and singing tones and it never had a in memory message at the end did it???
Say what you will about Ronnie but he is a master of conveying the heft if his singing more then most
Someone needs to make a MOVIE Based on this video!!!…..👍🏼👍🏼
I need a whole album like this
This sounds like a song that should be on the soundtrack to Morbius
This is a perfume ad
Epic
An epic haunting masterpiece ✨
Modern day meat loaf. I absolutely love this :)
Kesfedildiniz
I can't help but wonder why this video only has 8M views, missing a zero the least
Goosebumps! The melodyc is amazing
I bought this song on Amazon, and both the Amazon version and this version on YouTube seems to have some really subpar audio, I don't think it is just me? Like its a low sample rate or low bit rate.
The content and production of this song and video is excellent! Don’t sleep on this one
Just like unvaccinated kids  This song never gets old
I absolutely fucking love this! Been a big fan since day one, an this blew my mind. Love you Ronnie do some more shit like this.
4:35 fav part
His notes are so good and well balanced
Man i love both this song and your music it's amazing
This hard.
this is straight up hot ass garbage trash backed by mediocre band playing
Who else loves. Johnnie Gilbert????
Amazing
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
i am officially addicted to this song
Always get so emotional listening to this soft covers brings back memories from easier/harder times. Always goosebumps
Qué preciosidad... Me ha inspirado para escribir un libro de vampiros!
Spectacular 🧛‍♂️🧛
Holy Shit, 10 years mate, im old
Oh my. This is not very good.
Can we make a new music award called a Ronnie? Because this song right here derves one.
Love falling in reverse ❤️😍😍
Lol my mom literally thought this was a song from my theatre show tunes playlist
obra de arte 🖼
Beautiful vocals .Fanastic
I'm just realizing that's Saraya Beevis aka WWE's Paige.
duuuuuudeee wow shivers
watching this was an experience that shouldnt have been free 🤭🤭💕💕
HOLY SHIT HOW I'M I WATCHING THIS MASTERPIECE JUST NOW??
I mean he sings good but I don’t think that his listeners like this kind of musik (it’s like this for me bc I mostly listen to rock and punk)
Love it
I think old version is better than this revamped version but that version too is good enough to listen.
Haha, reVAMPED... hah get it? 😅
Better love story than twilight
Rest In Peace Derek
?????the song is call "IM NOT A VAMPIRE" and then at the end of the music video the sun comes up and what do u know HE BURNS THE FUCK UP!!!!!! i thought he wuz just going to stand there and have everybody like all shit he aint a vampire but nope !!!this song should be called IM A LYING ASS VAMPIRE 😆 😆
This guy does not look 38. he looks like he's in his 20's
Amazing 🔥
Masterpiece
Its funny at 1st when remember the old one, but every sec it’s getting better tho 👌👌👌👌  Masterpiece
Wish u will revamped again, other songs
WOW
definitely my favorite remake.
He is so sexy with long hair!!!!! I want to see him in a movie !!! Any movie 🍿 !!!! Im buying what he is selling !!!!
HOLY SHIT
snape looks really good
My favorite song and video of all times! and im old ive seen alot lol
Вокал просто улёт!!! 🖤🖤🖤
this is a really cool way to execute a vampire lol
I do love the pun of the song title.
Jesus, that wasn't a song. It was a goddamn performance!
i also considered ronnie an artist, but to see what how far he has come in 10 years, my God this man is a true Artist. This was a masterpiece
Ronnie is a shit bag, but this is phenomenal
HES SO PRETTY
I cried my anus out through my eyes! Dear Lord this is masterpiece! OMG the emotion captured in his voice! Brilliant!
Happy birthday you dramatic singer, go big or go home, right?
I listen and listen again. Great performance, a lot of effort and energy is invested in the song, the voice. Every song has your soul in it. I've been watching your transformation since the early years of the band. I'm your fan)) Double R don't stop. With love from Russia.
Wow
Fashionably late to the comments section, but this was beautiful. Ronnie is the modern day Meatloaf.
У меня Даже Мама вас любит ей 60лет 🤘
wow
I watched it at least 10 times and sometimes I cried. It's soo good and powerfull 🔥🥲🤩
Literal chilzzzz 😍❤️
Losing my life is my favorite,  his me hard because that's the situation I've been it and it's cool there's a song out there I can relate to...I feel as if I just woke up and my daughter is now a teenager,  gave me chills you can hear the passion in his singingvoice and that raw emotion is whats so cool about that song as a listener and one who lived a similar life I feel that pain too I haven't digged a song so much in a long long time,, I wasn't into this band before about 3 years ago now. Never was into the pop punk stuff they have as their older stuff tho, I can dig the mixture of types of music,  he makes them blend well. Definitely a fan now.
THIS IS SOOO GOOD OMG.
SOOOOO COOOOOL !!!!
Really hope they play this version in Chicago next year
WWEPaige looks amazing
he trynna be Carti so bad
3:35-4:20 is perfect
music video gives off interview with a vampire vibes.
This might be the best song I've ever heard in my life no joke. Can't count how many times I got goosebumps or almost came to tears.   More please and thank you
Good song
Essa versão ficou bem dark, apesar de eu gostar da animação na versão primária, essa ficou muito foda.
I will always love the original but this one hits the soul right in the teeth
That was truly a masterpiece
HOW AM I ONLY JUST NOW FINDING THIS?!?!?!?!?!??!??!!?!
2:53
Quelle voix j’adore ❤️😭
someone else from jesse here ?
Ronnie makes meat loaf looks like kids joke
I absolutely love this video, this song, and the band. Amazing work guys🔥🔥🔥
5:10 AHHHH
4:15 :0🌌♥ su voz ↗↗
3:24 a la madre ♥ :00
OK pero todos estamos de acuerdo que ronnie es un excelente artista en todo , ayuda tiene una voz tan hermosa y única  [cry] ya quisiera llegar a esas notas 🌌♥
Tremenda calidad del video,  la voz de ronnie aaaa es la ostia🌌♥ me dejo flipando
OK pero 🌌la voz de ronnie🌌 dios mio
The intensity of these reimagined versions is insane, I love every single one of them.
I need this to be a drama movie  movie and this song NEEDS to be played in the climax of the movie, AND RONNIE HAS TO PLAY THE LEAD
I love that Paige is in this video 💜
Enjoyed every song, each unique in different ways
wtf.... I'm 34yrs old and I have just heard this song for the first time. Jesus Christ, ppl who say "music is dead" haven't looked hard enough. This sound is incredible. Falling in a YT music hole is so much fun when it pays off!  Edit: decided to look into what "revamped" meant and I wasn't disappointed.  Edit2: I literally discovered FiR just now. If anyone has a "best of" recommendation I would really appreciate it. I'm sure I can find a video but I'd rather see what ppl suggest.
Hi my name is Chris  I'm an addict (Addicted to this song)
I have no words, this is amazing.
Thank god they disabled the dislike button. Because no TY. The original is king 🙃
Go as hard as you can with popular monster
Best in 2021 ! Like for respect for Song
I wish I could play your music at work.  I would have such a sense of calm. Although I would just break out in to song myself which may put off customers. 😄.   I can't deal with anymore Xmas Carroll's by Justin beiber, miley Cyrus and xtina 😵.  Killlll meeee.
I'm not crying, you are
IM A VAMPIRE!!!!!!!
You said you are not a vampire and at the end you admitted that you are a vampire   So......         SO WHICH IS IT
This is still a masterpiece
Более искусственную бабу не могли найти?
I'm in love!!!!! Omigod
This is amazing!!!!!!!!! 😍😍😍😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️
I'm dying for popular monster reimagined.
Pretty sure he is one
Bro. What. Why did I not know about this. This was amazing!
I like the part where he says "motherfucker I'm a vampire"
Holy Shit! i fucking love this!
WOW! UM YES NO FUCKING YES AWESOME AS ALWAYS! LOVE YOU RONNIE😎🤘💋💋💋💋💋💋💋✌
this version matches the name of the song better, first one was awesome this one is on fire
Verse 1] Well, I'm not a vampire, but I feel like one Sometimes I sleep all day because I hate the sunlight My hands are always shaking, body's always aching, and the dark is when I feed Well, I can lure any woman that I want to in my bed with me  [Pre-Chorus] And whiskey seems to be my holy water Mothers, better lock your doors and hide your daughters  [Chorus] I'm insane, well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold? For goodness sake's, where is my self-control? If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all hope  [Verse 2] Well, I'm not a zombie, but I feel like one today Self-induced comatose, chemical daze My head is always spinning from this dizzy blurry vision and my stomach has had enough I feel like a lady that is pregnant with a baby 'cause I'm always throwing up  [Pre-Chorus] Hi, my name is Ronnie, I'm an addict Daddy should've never raised me on Black Sabbath  [Chorus] I'm insane, well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold? For goodness sake's, where is my self-control? If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all hope  [Guitar Solo]  [Bridge] God bless all of you now 'Cause I'm going straight to Hell And I'm taking you down with me 'Cause you know damn well  [Chorus] I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold? I'm insane, well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold? For goodness sake's, where is my self-control? If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all hope, all hope  SHARE THE LYRICS     “I'M NOT A VAMPIRE” TRACK INFO  Produced ByMichael "Elvis" Baskette  Written ByDave Holdredge, Michael "Elvis" Baskette & Ronnie Radke  Release DateJune 25, 2011  EXPAND TRACK INFO   MUSIC VIDEO  ￼
ha *Revamped* lol
Who is the girl in the video? i need it for my thesis
love it gives me AFI vibes
Please do a Collab soon! Collabs is definitely the only place where you’re lacking at this point.. I’m more than ready to see my number 1 favourite artist/band create a masterpiece together 🤩😍🤩😍
Oh my- I don’t know what to say
Really good song except for the pregger thing
Holy sweet hell can this guy sing!! 😲
He s beautiful
Chilllssss
YOU GAVE ME CHILLS RONNIE
I just wish this work of art doesn't fall into the hands of tik tok
what a tear droppa cas*
This guy is a genius with many masterpieces.
The original was clean but now
Sooo goood!!! 🔥 🔥 🔥
I feel like- His sudden appearance near the window is somewhat memeable.
Emo.... kkk
this is so sick im speechless, is a masterpiece!
Holy shit.....that was phenomenal
Truly beautiful. Weird seeing Ronnie without all his tats though 😂
Beautiful
My favorite rock artist right now 🤘🏼🔥🤘🏼🔥🤘🏼
This is really good but I like the original better
It's really cool to revisit these moments and see how Ronnie looks back on them. Addiction is hell.
Paige 😍😍
Fucking amazing Ronnie!!!!!
I will give nothing NOTHING  but respect and tribute to the band  FALLING IN REVERSE FOREVER!!!!!!!!!🙏❤🤟
OMG the video beyond incredible and the vocals common seriously u couldn't even ask for better  This has been my favorite band in the world since the first album came out well there my number #2 my first is linkin park that's a given for me uk  But falling in reverse they have been on my top number #2 for a long time they truly r an amazing band.
This is epic also phenomenal.  I'm not a vampire but I feel like one..
This is probably the perfect song to the story of the character Thomas Shelby from Peaky Blinders!
This is amazing wow the vocals and this video is perfect this would be great as a movie
:0
What an experience to listen to this and feel the emotion behind the writing. I love this and as well "The drug in me is reimagined", great stuff!
Wow I never knew that was Paige from WWE.
O my fking god this is insane
Its even more sad when you realize its about her..
RONNIE I LOVE THIS REVAMPED I'm not a vampire !!!!! SWEET !! LOVE IT !!!!  MASTER PIECE !!  PAIGE LooKS SO BEAUTIFUL !!!!
🥰❤️‍🔥
So...he saved her life just for her to kill herself, on the balcony....
If this doesn’t give you “Phatom of the motherfucking Opera”  revamp version then idk
So can Disney work on this for a movie or what like take some tips Disney. I love you Disney you're my boo but time to step up and grow up. I mean we've all grown up now, give us what we deserve and that's Ronnie as a vampire prince belting it out majestically in his own movie. I mean, you got Jeremy Irons right.   Chop chop.
i just had a nearly 1h conversation with two mates about falling in reverse and our conclusion is that we are fucking happy that you are around and we love it that your so unconventional - so on point and powerful..  you guys literally rock
Not sure why I like this group so much. I'm an old fart.
Haven’t seen them live since I was 15 and 6 years later I’m finally gonna see them again 😭🖤
who told ronnie to go harder ten years later though lmao
Шедевр
This is art and he is a true artist.  Beautiful...
*for a vampire to exist just do kill themself in a music video*
is this vampire romeo and juilet
i should have watched this on Halloween smh mistakes were made
meanwhile old r0onnies watching new ronnie singing sober by fidlar
at one moment i was expecting "im waking up" from imagine dragons
dude went too hard
This is awesome.
Esta canción tiene un efecto tan impresionante en mí, es como si cada parte de mi cuerpo se detuviera, como si mi mente dejase de funcionar, sin pensar o decir nada, sólo poner atención a esta maravillosa obra de arte, que la piel se me ponga chinita y hormigueé con cada escalofrío para después sentirme a punto de llorar porque me cuesta creer que exista tal magnificencia.  Sin duda, no me arrepiento de haber empezado a escuchar FiR esta pandemia.
i feel like i just watched the best movie
This is absolute fire but doesn't beat the original.
Feel bad for those who don't know this masterpiece
Am I the only one that feels this deserves way more views??? I always come back to it. It truly shows the talent of this band.  🖤🖤🖤
locura de pieza!
Speechless.
this shit sucks
Simply one of the best revamps of a song by it's artist that I have ever heard in my entire life!!! I am absolutely obsessed with this song and it has single-handedly brought me back to Falling in Reverse and set it firmly in my top two favorite bands.  I F#$#ing love this song!!! Not to mention the video is an absolute masterpiece.  I watch this at least once everyday!!
Ronnie Radke... Bro I had love this song but after the revamped I feel you more and moreover... Tq for the song 😘
Small think: I'm  not VAMPIRE re VAMP ed
3.55 on fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
THIS IS MUSIC 🔥🔥
10/10
Just bougnt tickets to the Live From The Unknown tour! Absolutely cant wait!
There’s nothing this man can’t do ❤️
I love how you can feel his emotions in this song.
Wow
What in the Wuthering Heights is this, and why do I love it
No plz stop what have you done it’s ruined good god man wtf
where's the emo haircut guys
Goddammit put a goddamn solo in this and it'll be the best song ever goddamn written! Lol Love the original
what did I just witness... edit: this is beautiful
Accurate reaction: 😳🖤
Lovely
kinduva misnomer
Awesome, I'm in the middle of doing a Vampire one. However, I can see that now need to add a Love Song after watching this.
Getting evanescence bring me to life vibes from that opening
This man is a genius, a gift for humanity, goosebumps
Legendary
This is just a masterpiece
So it went from sounding like Avenged sevenfold, to sounding like a mixed up rip off of Nightwish/Marron 5/ with some Marilyn Manson tossed together.... Weird
Notice the lightning in the background strikes faster as he builds up to the crescendo.
This.. was... AMAZING!
Jesus Garbage Song .....
Is it just me, or did anyone else die a little inside when vampire Ronnie and the woman who he turned died?
Losing my life reimagined..
Love the epic orchestral sound!
The best Singer of all time Love u mr fire  ♥️🔥
Wait, they recorded this 1st 10 years ago? How have I only just heard of this band 1 hour ago?
I'm not sure where this whole piano opera shit came from but... I'M LIVING FOR IT ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
damn ronnie
Ronnie I need you as a rider from the south it's David HolyFire....my ppl and freinds and family are denominating from I I knew it Ronnie ::::(((
Боже мой, столько страданий, столько эмоций в этой песне, будто душа исполнителя вывернулась наизнанку, я просто в приятном шоке, это шедевр
Where the hell have I been? This Artis has inspired me again, to believe in alternative rock!!!
this song better be up for a grammy in 2022 or i will riot
Damn!
Is the male actor Ronnie with no tattoos or is it someone completely different? I honestly cannot tell
I can't honestly count how naturally high this song gets me. I have been so inspired to write because of this song.
Still a better love story than Twilight.
I have an idea for a band for wresltemanin this year cus makes sench if they won’t to they should have a falling in reverse ruion
Falling in Reverse! Damn these fellas are badass and what a mix of sound and style!
When they put Revamped, was that a pun or just part of the song?
I’m on the verge of tears, this is perfect
Hehe
Awesome
wow
Wait a second....Ronnie predicted Midnight Mass
The best thing since Bethoven, probably.
The production of this video beats the new Resident Evil 2021 movie Welcome to Raccoon City.
Love this song
*Girls:*  I'm not dramatic *Also Girls:*  0:00  - 6:17
I would love to see this as a full musical. This is awesome.
complimenti !
This 6 minutes is a better vampire love story then the whole Twilight series
like ''little piece of heaven'' from a7x! this song is so good!
R.I.P. Derek, another one gone too young....
RIP Derek. I don't know how I missed this !
MASTERPIECE
wooooooow
I need this to be a book,or audio or something...the story wld be sooo good O-O
Wow that was beautiful I love the way they are redoing these
Omg my music tastes have adapted. As much as I love the original, but this is utterly beautiful
You are not insane my friend, you a just have a level of creativity the world will never understand. Say hi to chester when you go
Guys....I think he might have been a vampire! ...Just saying...
holy hell
Friends of mine have made a f*cking halloween metal cover, let's check it out ;) --> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMrrPaxHgpQ
Rip Derek
Holy. Ball-slapping-rubber band of misfits!?!  He has showed how awesome and truly professional he is previously.  But this?  This just raised that level to rock god levels.😳🤯
this is freakin amazing !!
This song is like a movie I loved it. I wish the ending would of been been they both got away.  But in a way they did they both died together.
Quá đã
Love this 🔥🔥
This video and song is seriously not getting the appreciation it should.
Love it
this is what make you think music is art
Okay, it finally hit me. I've seen this video so many times because I love this version of the song, but I've always wondered why Ronnie looks so weird. He doesn't have tattoos. I'm so used to seeing him covered in tats that seeing him now without any feels wrong.
Joder, pero qué acabo de puto ver. Este videoclip está increíble, joder qué trabajo, qué interpretación qué música. La puta madre!!! me hizo llorar
No way Ronnie u and the guys smashed it and am I wrong in saying that the female in the video was 1 WWE Paige if so how did u manage to pull that out of the hat wow I am so amazed by the video
I love them!  Feels like this video interned for Rachel Berry from Glee- theatricality final grade DAMN!  All A's!
wow
paige take it easy on the collagen it looks like a man
I literally do not understand how Ronnie gets so much hell. Beyond being hot, his talent is undeniable..... Ronnie Radke can Ronnie Wreck me <3
The lyrics: 🕺💃 The vocals here: 🧛‍♂️🌧️🎻
aint gonna lie Ronnie is his own genre the amount of vocal skills should be recognized more
This voice is so sick! Like it
IM A VAMPIRE 🧛👫🏻 🔪🧍🏻‍♀️🧛🥀 🧍🏻🪢🧍🏻‍♀️🧍🏻🪢🧍🏻‍♀️🧍🏻🌞
Omg 😲
Ummm 😭😭.. memories....fr time flies...God help me
Oh can we also talk about how this man has inhumane vocal control? Crisp, harsh decrescendos are how you can tell someone has a healthy full and the fact that he can also SCREAM and not reck his voice is genuinely unreal
Okay who got Ronnie to look exactly like the vampire king or prime minister (I don’t fucking remember) from twilight???
Господи это просто что-то невероятное. У меня вообще нет слов, это так прекрасно, от этой шикарной музыки,его голоса и хора такая мощь исходит. Я в шоке, мурашки
This should definitely win a Grammy award and mabe even an oscar for best short film.
Dang! that girl is gorgeous
"Why did my father raise me on black Sabbath?"....... Super deep bro
Deep
I feel like I just watched a movie
Wow...that took me on a journey through a Ann Rice novel. Very cool, amazing vocals and the visuals are AMAZING! 🖤
Cool music and mv! - is a must for my emo soul
I hoped she wouldn't die but she also burned when the sun came up :(
This is just crap
Stop i wasnt expecting to see in ‘loving memory of derek jones’ now im really crying
This is 100x better than Twilight
Your the man💪🎵💯
Wow bravo 👏🏻
If you play this at 1.5 speed, it almost perfectly matches up with the OG version. Makes me want to hear his vocals in this version with the OG sound.
Here for my daily dose of this song, every day, still not bored or overfed!
God, the vocals... like, the rest is amazing as well, but the vocals are just godlike
OK BUT RONNIE AS BEETLEJUICE??
genuinely stunning! this actually had me reeling!
GENIUS.... I HAVE NO WORDS.
u look very handsome without those tattoos on your face
Wow.... Metaphors.
I want that vampire ... he looks divine and beautiful, he looks like that ... I love it
this was a whole ass movie
OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD
2:26-2:30 lol 🥴
I am impressed goof Job Ron
This should be Attack on titan last episode outro
Literally art, beautiful dark romance has me shook. I love this so much. Masterpiece vocals and music video.
it was allways meant to end here. bois. The legend himself
Pure class
Introduce me to the sun
Fucking cinematic ‹333

Thank God we still have music like this in 2021
Ngl still prefer the edgy emo old version
Oh my god ...
Goddamn Ronnie radke is so fucken creative. So glad my ex told me about escape the fate. Best thing she did
Ronnie Radke...Thank You for Everything. This is a goddamn masterpiece in every sense of the word.
goosebumps 🤯😍
THIS is how an Angel half demon sounds singing with his hearth and his soul
Me Encantó
💯💀🙏🏼🔥💫💖⚡💥💋👿☠️🙀🖤🤍💔💯⚡🕳️🫀🧠🫁🗣️👁️👀💀🦴👅🦾🦿👌🏾☝🏿🤌🏽🙏🏼🤳🧟🧛🧛🧛🧛🧛🧛
I feel like I just watched the most epic opera ever.
wow this is INSANE masterpiece goosebumps liked so much !
Just perfect like this🤩
just months later and still fucking goosebumps
Beautiful. And yet if in so much pain, maybe accepting that even with your worse done, that you still could be redeemed and saved. That would be worth the pain of accepting then the denial of hate crossing through your veins for believing you can't be. God bless everyone you said, yet what about yourself? Many in so many evils have changed, don't set yourself short, for its not about deserving it, about accepting grace.
https://youtu.be/aH40HxwAcec
Badass
Damn, from 4:30 to the end of the song, talk about someone with some serious vocal changes and the notes. holy shit.. Epic.
Good stuff! Love it that we got us an actual living rock star under 50 here 😆 🤣 js
fuck, this song is another level !!!!!
I just search for some good music for my list and i found this...is so frickin epic
Are love music
Okay 3:34 that clip is hilarious AF.
Only for me this is like Dark Shadows, Tim Burton' s movie?
Chopin kinnie type music
Wait are Paige and Ronnie still together? Bc HELL YESS that’s Paige right? Looks like her but I can’t tell lmao
I wish it was louder
Q
U kno… Ronnie jus does that shit.. Hes a real legend🤘🏽❤️‍🔥🎙
Wtf happened here
heh. reVAMPed
grande falling in reverse
I will love this song forever ronnie
This literally looks and sounds like it's from a triple-A budget film! this is art, purely and simply art.
I never noticed the wordplay 'til now. "Revamped" instead of "Reimagined".
que mitada
This was fucking awesome holy shit!
this could be the Mavis's father story
This is insane. One of the few vids I can watch over and over . Everything about it is amazing
when is netflix adaptation?
this isnt DUNE
sorry the lyrics about preggo with the baby lol!!!  took away the serious gothic immersion
one word for this "FIRE"🔥🔥
dude the guitar solo hits different
Pero kha....!!! :0 :0 :0 :') No me gustó esta versión..
God I get fucking chills when I listen to this!!! O O
Better than the original
Ronnie Radke's "Revamped", theatrical song/music/performance and lyrics are the epitome of creative musical genius paired with a  "Goth-Rock Opera Charisma"  that is truly amazing, also showcasing his talent... making this a special treat for  everyone!  I FUCKING LOVED THIS! 😘  THANK YOU , RONNIE! ROCK ON! 💙🎶🔥😁✌ -Comment written by Allyne McCulley 10/4/21
One of the good things about 2021! Definitely a masterpiece!
Words cannot describe just how epic this is.
that was truly beautiful
Great so Midnight Mass ripped off Ronnie Radke. Another thing to add to the reasons that show was bad 🙄. Ronnie however, never misses. Superb revamp and video 👍🏻👍🏻
Holy shit this kicked ass
am I the only one who thinks Ronnie looks similar to Loki here?
que obra prima da música!
Just bought the shirt ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
It’s weird seeing Ronnie without face tats.
I Never listen 🎶to this music 🎶this is my frist time
Wow... your vocals are so beautiful! They have certainly come a long way and I love the several renditions of this song ❤ You CAN do it, and you are creating amazing things!
fantastic!!!!
amazing song again <3 <3
Great job on this song! That has to easily be one of my favorite screams. Great vocals.
holy shit... this is art
I have only a word to describe this shit.            Goth
Holy shit. This is a master piece.
can someone please make a 10 hours version of this?
fire!!
He is so hot omg!!! I swear this man gets sexier with age my god
Lyrics [Verse 1] Well, I'm not a vampire, but I feel like one Sometimes I sleep all day 'cause I hate the sunlight My hands are always shaking Body's always aching, and the dark is when I feed Well, I can lure any woman that I want to in my bed with me  [Pre-Chorus 1] And whiskey seems to be my holy water And mothers, better lock your doors and hide your daughters  [Chorus] 'Cause I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold? For goodness sakes, where is my self-control? If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all hope  [Verse 2] Well, I'm not a zombie, but I feel like one today Self-induced comatose, chemical daze My head is always spinning from this dizzy blurry vision and my stomach has had enough I feel like a lady that is pregnant with a baby 'cause I'm always throwing up  [Pre-Chorus 2] And hi, my name is Ronnie, I'm an addict And daddy should've never raised me on Black Sabbath   [Chorus] I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold? For goodness sakes, where is my self-control? If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all hope  [Post-Chorus] When will you mortals believe? (He's not a vampire) I just want the world to bleed (He's not a vampire) Lust at the sight of your blood (He's not a vampire) I swear to God, I am not a— (He is not a—) (He is not a—)  [Bridge] So God bless all of you now 'Cause I'm going straight to Hell (Straight to Hell) And I'm taking you down with me Because you know damn well  [Pre-Chorus 3] So I sharpen my teeth 'cause I love the way it feels When I sink into your skin and draw the only thing that's real You don't believe me, should I write it in blood? You better drive that f*cking stake right down my heart and try to run Motherf*cker, I'm a vampire   [Chorus] And I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold? For goodness sakes, where is my self-control? If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all Heart has f*cking lost all Heart has lost all hope (He's lost all hope) (He's lost all hope) (He's lost all hope)     Thanks for reading this I hope it was helpful! Have a good day!
I had to watch the original because I was a little confused by some of the lyrics even if they were delivered melodramatically. I do like this version though. Both are good, but this one I think I prefer.
Holy shit this was amazing
This version Holy shit better then the original
So the vampire being burned at the stake is him over coming the addiction right? I love this song so much. This and Popular Monster really speak to me. This song should put Ronnie up there with Freddy Mercury. He's come so fucking far
This Song is so epic, thanks for that ! <3
Fucking epic.
I listen to this song and watch the video almost 20 times a day. I just can't stop I'm addicted to this song!
I don’t have words to say I loved it 😍
Super like if I could, straight into my favs. Amazing voice.
i find this one actually better than the og one and it came out on my bday xd
Never have i ever sang a song that gave such an enormous headache. Sheesh.  Practice practice, I guess...uhm, and breathe.
Omg , each revamp is soo f**** ........ We can have a full album with this tematic ? Please =)
The other version is great but this is more feeling and emotion and the choir is AMAZING.😍😍😍
masterpiece
I love it❤️You’re a pure genius❤️❤️
HOLY COVER!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHAqgWHA8JA
What a beautiful song, thank you... ❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥👏👏
I love Ronnie's voice so much
Man I study the tech in this song with Ronnie's vocals.  Guys, you want to learn control here is you song.
Damn this is amazing. Twilight needs to catch up though 🥲

face it Ronnie. Yes. Yes you are.
love Paige as the lady. (also as Ronnie's gf)
This is my new favorite song ever.
Masterpiece .
Why do I love it ffs
Paige is the Most sexiest and Beautyfull Woman Ever.!!!!
Came here from Jesse James West XD
Here from Jessie James West 🤙👌
That first "My heart has lost all hope" tho.
QUE ESPECTACULAR !!!! 😍😍😍💓💓
His vocal range is just insane. I was impressed by Popular Monster but I seem to always come back to this one.
Wow! The cinematography in this video was top notch! ❤️ You have an incredible voice and the emotions are evident throughout the entire song.
Ohhhhhhh, I get it. ReVAMPed.
This music touch my soul.
Falling in Reverse ft. Amy Lee, WE WANT IT.
THIS SONG GOT RELEASED ON THE DAY OF MY SONS BIRTH!! this is now Damens song
"I don't know if I'm makin' movies or music videos"- NF
And the whole band
I love this song so much
Fucking..wow the transition to screaming his voice the lyrics and how deep they are I almost cried a fucking mazing😍😍😍
I absolutely love seeing the transformation of ronnie and his music as time goes on. The original of this song was amazing. and this just blew it out the park even further
How could anyone thumbs down this.....this is one of the most powerful songs I have personally ever heard and has those theatrical undertones that makes it that much better. Absolutely f**king amazing!
This song is almost unrecognisable in tone from the original version. That was a silly rehab clinic, this is a gothic orchestral tragedy.
I'M DYING TO HEAR A BMTH AND FALLING IN REVERSE COLLAB!!!! <3
Still a better love story than Twilight
Man Ronnie has come a long way from his days in Escape the Fate.   His vocal talents and lyrics are top notch, almost couldn't recognize him.
this is what happiness looks like
Amazing loving these, new versions truly shows Ronnie's talent, fan or not, credit where credit is due 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Reminds me of Dark Shadows abit which I love and I absolutely love this revamped version!! This definitely needs an award !!!♥️
Simply incredible. Absolute perfection from everybody involved.
Every time I hear and watch these incredible music videos, I LOVE FALLING IN REVERSE!!! Where have I been? Oh, yeah, addiction....again....
I have this on my work play listed and listen to it every day. Every single time I get goose bumps.  This song is a master piece. A God Damn complete master piece.  I know this comment will never be read by the Artist him self.  If he did. All I could say is thank you. This music is amazing, has helped through a lot in my life. I am truly thank the world has people like Ronnie. I do not know him, I don't know every song, or seen him live. I appreciate his art and craft.   I just hope he known how he has help change the life of one simple family man.  Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
I'm here for the full album of revamped songs. And the next 10 albums. Also, this was Ronnie's masterclass on how to make music and actually sing. Then the director of the video gave a masterclass on how to actually do a music video.
Someone watched too much Twilight and Vampire Diaries...
I. Am. Fucking FLOORED
yall didnt have to force it like this blessing me ears
paro
I... I just need to watch this again. And again.
Ronnie I fuckin love you... have for a looooong time. I’m a straight male with a beautiful wife and two boys but your so sexy.... escape the fate and I’m done...
Excelente...!!!
I like the original song but i love this one even more 😍
Felt like I just watched a movie.
Sad won't be seeing snoop but this will be fun as hell so lets get high lets get drunk and go crazy for them and Metallica
The whole self harm on the tub should've been blurred out because there are people who get triggered by that.
I stopped listening ETF and FIR about 6 years ago. I just came here to check whats new
These 6 minutes were better than the entire Twilight franchise
yo si le doy a la vampira
Absolutely amazing song, but the intro sounds awfully similar to Deathstars - Chertograd
Running in dress shoes, thats real pain right there.
5:43 when you think it cant get any better then he hits this note
Holy shit, this and popular monster are taking music videos to the level, ps I'd let vampire Ronnie bite me🤷‍♀️
В сотый раз смотрю - до сих пор мурашки по коже
Damn Ronnie’s acting is awesome. 👏🏻👏🏻
this Is the most edgy cringe bullied dep emo kid thing I have ever seen...
Wow!
that video was amazing,,,
This is fukn amazing seriously
Relatable.
Oh my fuck I am blown away
At the end, is it the "ghost" version or real version of the girl that is burning in the sunlight? There's two versions of her and we only see one of them burn up in the sunlight.
Что же, я не ваш фанат, но я чувствую себя им.
Lip syncing this is a ride of emotions.
The only problem I have with the music video (It’s not a big problem, I still love the video and music) is at 2:00 Ronnie uses a flat head shovel to dig a hole
This doesn't have enough views
this guy is so fucking gender right now
my girlfriend likes this song
Remake...wow...we dont have enough in the movie industrie...thank god there are Tom MacDonalds.
Holy fuck I love it.
wow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!nice..
Speaking as a Werewolf, I'm not quite sure how to feel about this...
Watching this masterpiece while eating dragon fruit...
This is hell good🙌
This popped up on my YouTube music playlist, and I had to come here to say, oh my god. In utter shock of how heavenly amazing this is. I'm in awe.
Guys, i'm starting to think he might not be a vampire...
Ronnie is Pure Vampire Genius 😇
Awesome! Ronnie, You is my favorite! you is actor, singer, has a presence, you is very fucking cool! #manda #um #Salve #pro #brasil! hehe
Listening to this song on repeat makes me feel like I'm deaf at the very beginning 🤣🥰
Not going to tell you how many time I just sing and belt this song in my car even when I’m having a good day,this song is such a master piece!!! Would love to hear this live on a opera stage in New York!!!
Tag. You’re it 😂
Wow started listening to his music from The popular monster but this one is wow brother please make more. This was like a movie and I felt all the words he said
Это ШЕДЕВР.
im so obsessed with this guy
Wow. I've been listening to Falling In Reverse for many years (basically since they started) and I gotta say this is beautiful art with their song.
When that full orchestra hit, I knew this was gonna be great.
HERMOSO
If i were him at the end being a Vampire, I would have wiped that whole mob out.
Wtf Ronnie .....musical Genius much?
ART! Love Ronnie!
He is fantastic.
what a weird video
shivers all over 🥀
Me three minutes in: holy fuck this is great Me realizing I still have another almost 4 minutes to go: Jesus Christ they turned it into a movie!
How tf does this song not have 1 billon views? Baffles my mind... crank this shit up on some real home audio or a dac and headphone amp. Turn dat shit up!!!! People on some rca buds and a fucking 2010 motorola phone on yt. You need volume people!
Glad this one doesn't have Jafar Squidward in it
The original will always be classic and hold a special place, this slaps hard af though and I love it.
Wow, again, I cannot get enough of this band !! I LOVE THEM!! WHERE HAVE I BEEN? Oh, yeah, addiction....
If Green Day can have a musical so can Falling In Reverse!
If this doesn’t win a music video award and some “twerk, drug, shoot em’ up, my boo left me” video wins I will SHIT MY PANTS! Seriously around of an applauses. Wait it needs a Tony, a Grammy everything. This was everything.    Congratulations Ronnie.
Amo esta maldita canción ♥️♥️😣🥺🇲🇽♥️
this hits so hard
Beautifully haunting vocals, the track is incredible! Very well done! And the video is stunning!
I'm at a loss of words, saw the reimagined Drug in Me is You so I watched this, and plz do Losing my Life or Popular Monster plz
Ни чё себе

אמהלה !! מה השיר הזה עושה לי בגוף 😶
Umm, he is a vampire, because somehow he got hotter while the rest of us aged.
1:57 Me: *Raises Eyebrows
Well, I'm not a vampire But I feel like one Sometimes I sleep all day Because I hate the sunlight My hands are always shaking Body's always aching And the dark is when I feed Well, I can lure any woman that I want to in my bed With me And whiskey seems to be my holy water Mothers better lock your doors And hide your daughters I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness' sakes Where is my self control? If home is where my heart is Then my heart has lost all hope Well, I'm not a zombie But I feel like one today Self-induced comatose, chemical daze My head is always spinning From this dizzy, blurry vision And my stomach has had enough I feel like a lady That is pregnant with a baby 'Cause I'm always throwing up Hi, my name is Ronnie I'm an addict (Hi, Ronnie) Daddy should've never raised me on Black Sabbath I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness' sakes Where is my self control? If home is where my heart is Then my heart has lost all hope God bless all of you now 'Cause I'm going straight to hell And I'm taking you down with me 'Cause you know damn well I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness' sakes Where is my self control? If home is where my heart is Then my heart has lost all hope All hope All hope
I listen to this every day like I haven’t played a song so much in a long time! Can’t wait to hear what you put out next!
*Takes long drag of cigarette*  Hear me out, though...  He was, in fact, a vampire.
This is truly a masterpiece Ronnie? I’m glad you got an award for this.
Heh, “revamped”. XD
Damn that was really good!
Ronnie still didn't get over his addiction? Poor lad.
Saraya beautiful as always! But damnnnn the video and music, production work must’ve took a lot! Well done to everyone involved! 🖤
i love  you
ahui
Better story than twilight?Yes.Really hot guy as main character?Yes.
Wow.
Chills, literal chills
Wow, super cool ! From Colombia 😎
This is epic

This song. I swear. I have been listening to it once a day since it came out. His voice. Just damn. I'm listening, thinking oh I love that sound best, then I get to the cliff and I'm like, fuck, that's my favorite.. But then the tub scene arrives..and shit.. Ronnie bringing the..hurt.. His voice was made for that. And yet, he does anger and rage so well...as well.... I wish I had known of him and his voice sooner.
Have studios just started refusing to publish rock and metal music? First breaking Benjamin Then Avril Lavigne Now falling in reverse What the fuck is going on here?
This song has always been one of my favorites. When he came out with the Revamped version it literally gave me goosebumps and uncontrollable tears. His music hits me in my core. Thank you Ronnie Radke. Thank you.
This man is a genius. This gave me chills. So glad to have him back.
I feel like I've emerged from a 10-yr coma
Having heard the first version and enjoying it I hated this at first, but it's not bad.
I’m crying for my 13y/o self.
I swear this is such a piece of motherfucking masterpiece
um hello straight up masterpiece   i’m not one to slut shame so i hope this comes across the right way 😭 but they’re putting a lot more effort into this shit than a lot of mainstream songs about the same thing again and again
this feels more vampiric i love it help
im cringing at myself :):))))
OHZOhoajOhoJjajao *fangirls* LMSKAOOA
dayum first time listening to the revamped version
Ha! ReVAMPed!
I do not like Ronnie as a person. But I used to love falling in reverse and I used to listen to this song all of the time when I was a teen, so when I saw this pop up in my recommended, I had to listen to it just for nostalgia purposes at least. Got to say, this is really pretentious and really sucks ✌️
Am I the only woman who thinks he's a very talented and an extremely attractive man xx
I honestly wasn't a fan of the original, but I love this revamped version!! Ronnie is so awesome and talented.
pls keep making more of these
Those screams sent shivers through my whole body.  Much love guys!
How does he do it the talent on his guy MY GOD!! He can take any tone any beat and make it AMAZING!! Ill never stop following him or his band!
Wow💖
You can just go ahead and keep redoing all your songs
Oh woah... amazing!!!
Another master piece
Masterpiece.
HUGEEE
This... Is not a song... It's a fucking epic movie... 🔥😳🖤
WOW... FALLING IN REVERSE.... AMAZING !
You are awesome Ronnie!
Every time I hear this song I get the chills! The amount of talent he has is nothing short of amazing.  The emotions with the highs and lows in his voice is something that I will never forgot and I look forward to hearing more masterpieces! You have a gift! Thank you for sharing it with us,  don't stop being you!
Listened to this 2 months ago after hearing trilogy and pop monster. Love them. Didn’t like this one. Just decided to listen to it again tho this morning and I literally was so close to crying by listening to it. Ronnie is one of the most talented voices ever. He can do anything. Especially given his past. I have bad depression so the fact that he literally started from the bottom now he’s on top. You can do anything you want to. I now love this song. The end of it tho ommgggggg I can’t get enough of it “heart has fking lost (something idk what he’s saying)!!!!!” It’s great
this song is tooo good!!!
I'm just waiting for a musical that has a whole bunch of Ronnie's remakes in it. This is amazing
very good video
FML this is good!
Ronnie and Remington r both vampires and u can’t convince me otherwise
Hear me out!!! Falling in Reverse and Palaye Royale duo!!!! @palayeroyale
I like how this song has a more Gothic approach than the original version.
HOW DID I NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS
I'm here because of paige
Bloody hell, this is beautiful
who is Derek Jones
paigeeeee and ronnieee
over the top
this IS FUCKING AWESOME.
beautiful
I cant wait to here this LIVE in November at Rockville 🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼
An incredibly haunting Masterpiece 🖤
I'm not mad at this version ngl but I havent listened to Ronnie much since he left ETF so my question is did this man take singing classes? he sounds less raw. I dig it
I’m truly speechless🖤
Isn't this the same mansion where the mv for "Tonight is the Night I Die" by Palaye Royale was filmed?
Simply....Amazing.
Ah back when Paige was actually hot and didn't look like a meth head
I'm Not a weirdo but i cry when i see this love you guys 🤘🏻
Turns out he's a vampire.
and this has only 6.9M views *WHY*?!
Just saying, the high note in the last part of the song is just wow…I don’t have words for how much he’s grown musically and even with doing this for years now he’s just gotten better.
Whatever happened to all the allegations against Ronnie by various women?
Having Paige in this video for a song about addiction takes it to another level.
One word; WOW
Wow how have I just seen this!!! 🔥
back for my third day
i replayed this so many times. this is true music
Боже мой, это невероятно! Я не понимаю, почему такие шедевры не крутят по нашему телевидению! Это в миллион раз лучше чем все, что я видела
This is fcking beautiful. A masterpiece.
20121 Россия , слушаю их песни нон стопом на повторе
You know a song is great when it ends and you have a million things to say but can't manage to utter a word. Brilliant work by all involved.
When is the next revamped please Need MOAR
This was fucking amazing
The end of the song where Ronnie screams gets me everytime. I get chills its my favorite part.
Am I the only one getting some Vampire Diaries Damon Salvatore  vibes?
This made me feel like I was watching a movie. They did really good on the video
I honestly hate this Ronald Radke has really fallen
He makes my heart race with vocal and theatrical brilliance. 🖤
I wanna see this play 👀
4K Views and 15K comments ? lol Ok nvm i like your reactions anyway bro, keep it up :DD I knew this song before but it´s still sick.
Here after drug in me reimagined. never listened to his music before but its amazing
This seriously blew my damned mind. Holy fuck.... now I'm obsessed.
I don΄t know about the others but i΄m here for Paige. But damn this song is so good.
First i thought "ok let's listen to this YT recommendet song, name sounds nice".  Now i'm still sitting, Overwhelmed by what I've experienced.  I'm super impressedm this is art on a wholle uniqe level,
Snape + loki
His voice is 🔥
OMG 😲 The Voice, The Score, The Story, The Graphics, The Girl & The Ronnie-Vamp 🥀 UNBELIEVABLE... ❣🥀☠❣🥀☠❣
que chucha
Wow!!!!! Love it!   😍🤩what a power...!!! 😅
Absolutely genius is all I could say after watching this. I'm in love with both versions and he can really sing 😭😭😭
Ronnie has better hair than me and it’s sad 😢
Revampired🤔😲😯
Looks like Severus Snape XD
If i had only 6 minutes 17 seconds left to live i would choose to listen to this masterpiece.
I think this is right besides Bohemian Rhapsody on the throne of best all-round songs.
this song reminds me of a movie  interview with the vampire...❤
Love it!
Beautiful 🖤
There is Nothing this man can not do. This is one of the best ronnie fucking un real bro
I wanna see him make a whole goth ballade album, this and the drug in me reimagined are so fucking dope I can’t stop playing them on repeat and singing along even tho I can’t sing to save my life
Man! Their video’s are like mini movies.
Me, repeating this song over and over: For Goodness sakes, where is my self control?!
man, this so beautiful. I fully understand the lyrics now that I’m almost 11 months sober after 13 years of drug addiction. when he says “hi my name is Ronnie, I’m an addict” makes me tear up bc he sounds like he’s accepted he’s an addict unlike the original where it seems mocking. the “holy water” part my god my favorite part it’s just so beautiful the way he sings it.
Ronnie with no tattoos 😳
Lolol
Para mí ver esto es un placer visual que no se imaginan
hello!! we‘are japanese punk! I would like to see our comrades in the world https://youtu.be/TnfiOpo7Hu0
I wish i could just delete the song from my memory so i can listen it again as i did first time cuz my hears had literall orgasms
I can’t explain what i feel while listening it🤚🏻
I’m obsessed
"Rad" -Frank Iero
Muy buena musica escuchando desde Puerto Rico 🇵🇷 lo escucho a diario 👏👏
So the gunshot she saw from the window did someone try and shoot him when he vamped out and that's who he was feeding on when she walked in?
Was I the only one that thought "oh shit its the tall lady from RE8!
Wish this was a actually show would be amazing
Badassery at its finest!! FIR is my fave band hands down!!
Ronnie when from a werewolf to a vampire...
This made my day as an "old" fan this made my heart happy🖤
Where could I find that exact shirt hes wearing?
"What genre of music is this?" "Oh dear child this is the ronnie radkie he is his own genre."
Perfect!   🇧🇷❤
make it a movie already !!!!!!!
Amei😻😻😻♥️
pretty epic
Mind blowing, amazing
this was better than half the movies that have come out within the last 10 years holy fuck
Love to see Paige ❤️
Paige from wwe i see
This song honestly needs more hype !! Ronnie killed it and his voice sounded so beautiful as well as his piano playing!!!! This was absolutely AMAZING !!!!!!
What was the budget for this thing? 😳
I'm at a loss for words.  Perfection.
🖤🩸
Does anyone by any chance know the name of the woman in this video? I feel like I know who she is; but I just can’t figure it out. Thanks in advance lol
This is phenomenal! I don't think that I can imagine anything better than an entire album of this.  On a side note: does anyone else get major Lestat vibes from Ronnie's performance as a vampire? I could see him playing Lestat in a remake of queen of the damned and having his own vocals during the concert scenes ☠️
I'm sorry but Ronnie looks so pretty in this music video-
Goosebumps!!!
this deserves an award in musical talent, high vocal range, and directing.. a god damn piece of audio/visual art is what we just experienced here, ladies and gentleman..
It's almost been 6 months... That means new single right?
OMG! So far 17 video songs 'shot in black/and/or night' all about death & futility. What happened to 'ROCK-N-ROLL? This is all INDIE DEATH METAL!!  THIS IS NOT ROCK MUSIC! This was 'stuck in' my SEARCH for BEST INDIE ROCK SONGS 2020, & THIS is not it! This is DEATH METAL OPERA! I'm NEVER gonna BUY any of this NOISE!  Yeah, I know...You say: GOOD, get the hell out of our hell.   "I'M GONE, BYE KIDS!!!"
this felt like watching a movie oh my god. The visuals VOCALS EVERYTHING I LOVE IT SO MUCH
Why do I relate to this so much-.....
Ronnie radke is a fucking genius. Best artist ever!  Best opera !
oh god, that's beautiful
I heard a song on prime.  Song has comments turned off. Clicked this so here I am.   Hits nice in the car. Shakes your insides and hits ya with some chills. (The other song bangs, this song rips you apart but in a good way, ha!)
🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀
It gives me chills
Is just me or prof snape learned piano and made something awesome?
Anyone noticed the face or bust in the cloud at 5:46
this is so beautiful
Omg amazing 👏
that ending hit diffrent
Eu não sou um vampiro...FILHO DA P*TA EU SOU UM VAMPIRO!!!
Fuck man. I'm so stuck on this.
before he got all his face tats or editing ? hmmm
Why the fuck this masterpiece has only 6,6m views?!?!?!
Beautiful ❤️
yawaa oi
I did not know I still had an undying crush on this guy I feel like time hasn't passed since my teen days wth I'm very amazed how his music progressed since then it's a bit more yes gothic but inspiring in a way
I’m speechless. This is amazingily, breathtakingly,  sombre, beautiful, gothic style and perfectly Vampiric!
Sobrang ganda ng bersyon na ito!!! T^T<33

Epicardo
If his next album is all songs like this, it will be the greatest thing ever released
i watch this video when i get sad it’s so good
Love him or hate him, his talent is crazy. WOW, speechless. Do more!! PLEASE!
Chills every damn time 🥶
Congratulations 👏👏👏 and I Love Paige ❤️❤️❤️
Chills. From my arms to my face been listening to Ronnie for over 10 years since before he went to prison
God damn. Ronnie did it again  🥰
Fucking EPIC!!!!!!
This video reminds me of a modern-day Meatloaf video
They've reached a new level of epicness
Never let anything take away from your art :-)
Sounding good guys :)
Well holy fucking shit, and I cannot say that with enough emphasis
Esta muy bien,es precioso que historia más bonita,lo ves como es una diosa I love you paige
I hate how there's not new album
I like it.✨I’m kind of not really a vampire.😇
Totally hope that more people get to see this amazing song. I think it will age very well.
Another great masterpiece, this is ART!!!! and what a voice!!! Imagine Ronnie really shaking the opera scene around with this! :D
I can just look and listen to this all day, what beautiful music and words, MY GOD!!!!
you can't enjoy this if you haven't been listening to the original track
Isn't that Severus Snape? He's so talented!
Please keep up the revamped songs with the piano and gothic overtone. I fucking adore this shit. Every single lyric gives off a different feeling compared to the originals. I've always loved Falling in Reverse but these last couple have been borderline orgasmic. Keep up the beautiful work
This is version would be fucking sick at a live concert
Very good song and music video.
FUCKING OUTSTANDING THATS WHAT IM TALKING BOUT
It's like a movie 😳😳😳
That's such a great song, performance & video, but it's not suited for Karaoke whatsoever.
Aro?!?!??!     I love him this was a joke 😘😘😘😘
Judas
Damn this was lit
Ronnie should be a vocal actor 👀
Lyrical, vocal, compositional genius displayed numerous times!
This just shows that Ronnie is a musical GENIUS!
My son : "Daddy should've never raised me on Falling in reverse"
Ohhh el video y cancion culiao buenooo
This is the best thing I've seen in a long time. Legit has me ugly crying.
This is a masterpiece and I connected with it on such an emotional level. A very well done Ronnie.  Keep it coming!
fallout boi
Masterpiece :O
Почему здесь не миллион лайков…
God I love him so much.
Can’t get enough of this masterpiece
american gothic as its best
Good to see Peters rock opera, been waiting !!!
Damn wash your dirty mouth out Ronnie, how could you write that terrible lyric. I mean you surely meant that everyone should be raised on Black Sabbath.
This is so much more than music. This is truly an experience.
oh hey, there are all of my repressed memories of being the weird emo vampire kid in 2006. Can't believe I found them!
WTF?! This is insane! Poland send big gratz :o
Saraya-Jade Bevis?????????????????????????????????????
Ok this was epic and we need this in an imax theater asap!!! Ronnie without face tatts took me back though lol
Might actually be a vampire
my favourite artist of all time Ronnie Radke
This was F¥cking AMAZING! Never heard of this band before…. I’m  obsessed 🖤
These guys are so damn talented, as a band they all have some serious ass range!
Yes. Yes.  Yes.
I absolutely love these redone versions.... so much!!
L'ascolto almeno 10 volte al giorno e mi emoziona ogni volta
Am I the only one here just to see “Paige”
3.9k people have a serious distaste in good music.
Wow... This gives me chills. Fucking incredible.
Not a fan really of this guy as a person but i have to admit when someone can really sing. Theres passion behind it too which lets you know he has a real love of music. Musically speaking its good but i think ill keep my other thoughts about the "band" to myself lol
When you think a song cannot be better:
I relate to this song
Omg, I'm crying...this is a masterpiece!
Nose quien penso que esto fue una buena idea... 😂😂
This masterpiece ascends words.
This song was done almost 10 years ago now he remakes it .. Its a million times better then the original great job
Say what you will about him as a person, but this guy is truly one of the best musicians out there today.
Ronnie is a king of vampires XD
Maigaddd dis song
Snape as an angsty teenager
I like both versions
this is not just a song
Good movie :D
I have listened to this so much that i am probably half of these views lmao
Le salió un clip recontra naco lastima siempre hacia todo Masomenos bien
This should win the "Best Music Video Ever" award!
FIR is heavily underrated
Que cringe ctm
I love this, Ronnie, but I'm sorry I just adore the og one more. I do see this as an epic trailer music though. This is just fucking amazing.
Amazing
3:53 oh my god that note he hits is SICK
After this and The Drug In Me Is Reimagined, I’d really like to see RR in a musical or something. His vocal range would be cool to see in that sort of setting.
No cause why this make me cry
Dude, this is THE..MOST..EPIC..EMO MUSIC EVER!!!!!! Ronnie and FIR should be proud!!!!
i'm not a big fan of the end of this...  he brought her back to live with him for eternity... then for no apparent reason just surrenders?  i was expecting a hell of a fight scene when he was standing there and they confronted him... but he just surrendered :(
Nicholas Cage's son hasn't handled the vampire thing so we'll either
Truly beautiful art too
I didn’t hear there was a revamped version until the other day when my mom showed me it and I was in a trance to say the least.
Fucking Masterpiece
Holy fuck this is amazing
Great music
I felt like I rewatched Dark Shadows
Jesus Christ.
The screaming...I need more of the screaming pleaseeeee
não canso de ver isso pqp
My guy watched way to much twilight.
аж мурашки по коже
Your a fucking musical god, I wish I could pay for lessons from you 😭😭😭🙏🏼✨🌙
This is seriously a masterpiece!!!!
This Is a beautiful Masterpiece.
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
se sempre me deixa surpreso
Reverse this curse next
Ha revamped
"If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all hope" This line just hits different.
WOW
Okay but why is this good
that some vamp shit right there
This is the most beautiful song and video I have ever seen
How did I just stumble on this band?Fucking love this, brilliant minds at work.
the best thing i´ve ever seen. fucking epic!
damn... that was a wild fuckin ride
Toujours un plaisir à revoir, vraiment écoutez-le ;) Visionnez-le, partagez-le ;)
If only you understand his lyrics and not just admired the movie
Jesus fucking christ this is beyond all expectations
I Listened to Ronnie Back in ESTF and I still Listen to Him in Falling in reverse. Very Talented Individual, and He has turned his Whole Life around. GOOD JOB Ronnie!
like this version then original
This video/song is absolutely stunning . The lyrics, performance, production, vocal, everything about it. Unique and shows what's missing from bands today. Pop acts /bands whatever all sound the same /look the same, They basically sing nursery rhymes. Listen to a pop song today and it's like children in a playground singing. Falling in reverse are  exceptional. keep doing what you are doing. I admit I want more of this.
This is magnificent
Kuivjfjut
I like how the screaming/growing is transitional to his characters emotional state of mind. Hes sad at first and then his depression channels into explosive rage mirroring in his vocal tones then as he's finally destroyed himself coming back down to that feeling of true regret and sadness with a little rage left. To someone like me who has a hard time with Lorne shore. It really sells the song and my acceptance of the pitch changes . Its a song that bridges the gap of genres and fans and forces you into liking something that you could otherwise find unappealing through emotional projection. I think ronnie is a genius and he should write a rock opera. This is a transformative body of music and elevates ronnie into a rock god instead of a niche hero.
What are those things on the night stand under the lamp? It kinda looks like an old school metal weed pipe.
The clip is so great
I never thought I can hear another masterpiece (The Drug In Me Is Reimagined ) from you guys (I am not saying you are bad musicians, you are the best of the best) and I hear another fucking masterpiece. Ronnie I really love how you sings. Those vocal changes and music gives me goose bumps bro. I listened many times and I still feeling those emotions. That says is a fucking masterpiece. Congratulations to the band.
I don't know if it's because I just smoked some gorilla glue, I think I just watched my first Opera?!
That vampire can sing
Please keep remaking old songs!
Ronnie is such a legend.
Wow
Sellouts
Too bad he's a wife beater..
Well, I'm not a vampire, but I feel like one Sometimes I sleep all day 'cause I hate the sunlight My hands are always shaking Body's always aching, and the dark is when I feed Well, I can lure any woman that I want to in my bed with me  And whiskey seems to be my holy water And mothers, better lock your doors and hide your daughters  'Cause I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold? For goodness sake, where is my self-control? If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all hope  Well, I'm not a zombie But I feel like one today Self-induced comatose, chemical daze  My head is always spinning from this dizzy blurry vision and my stomach has had enough I feel like a lady that is pregnant with a baby 'cause I'm always throwing up  And hi, my name is Ronnie, I'm an addict And daddy should've never raised me on Black Sabbath  I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold? For goodness sake, where is my self-control? If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all hope  When will you mortals believe? (He's not a vampire) I just want the world to bleed (He's not a vampire) Lust at the sight of your blood (He's not a vampire) I swear to God, I am not a... (He is not a) (He is not a)   So God bless all of you now 'Cause I'm going straight to Hell (Straight to Hell) And I'm taking you down with me Because you know damn well  So I sharpen my teeth 'cause I love the way it feels When I sink into your skin and draw the only thing that's real You don't believe me, should I write it in blood? You better drive that fucking stake right down my heart and try to run Motherfucker, I'm a vampire!  And I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold? For goodness sake, where is my self-control? If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all Heart has fucking lost all Heart has lost all hope (He's lost all hope) (He's lost all hope) (He's lost all hope) All hope, my heart has lost all hope
This is one of the most emotionally stirring revamped versions of his old songs I've heard so far. This and the drug in me is re-imagined have both given me chills listening to them
Beautiful music video 👍👍👍♥️♥️
Amazing isn't even the right word for the. I dont think there is a word. I have to know, was this a partial recreation of Widows Hill?
Falling in reverse has stolen my heart and ears with this masterpiece of music
What was this movie?
This is amazing.  I just.. no words are coming.
Can someone please tell me what the hell I just watched like the song is a straight gothic ballad but what the fucks the plot of this music video cos I think there's a deeper  story here.
1st time listening: Tf is this, the original is way better.  2nd time listening: Okay, maybe this isn't so bad after all...  3rd time listening: HIIII MY NAME IS RONNIE I'M AN ADDICT   Ronnie, you're a goddamn genius, please keep making these and do a whole album!!!

Hell yes seraya aka Paige, and Ronnie,. Ive been waiting to see this, she fits in perfect
I can listen and watch this daily many times. N I have
When someone says Ronnie isnt talented after THIS!!! The vocals, the piano .. pure Art!!!!!!
I love this version because it's like a tragic vampire romance movie
Is that Nicolas Cage?
now this is a masterpiece
Ronnie the Volturi
3:25
This is like a “I would do anything for love” 25 years later, but with vampires.
the only bad thing about this video is the girl not wearing a chemise under the corset
Who's the pretty lady?
The edgy loki
Please do a reimagined of this whole album
3:50 CHILLS.
~I absolutely love when Ronnie drops tracks like this. His voice is epic, him and Lynsey sterling need to work on something.~
Why doesn't this have 1 billions views already. This is art. This song hits me on so many levels, pure talent.
She looks like a prettier Veronica Zemanova...if that is even possible.
3:13 he look like Howl
Re"vamped" lol. I'll leave now
Superb!!! 🥶😱👏👏
The best music video ever!
Just revisiting this masterpiece, thanks again for this Ronnie.
this is amazing its actual marvel music
Hm. I became So cold on 15.09.78
Esto es arte, I can't stop listening to her, I love her. La primera ya era buena, pero esta, me eriza la piel. They did a wonderful job, the new concept and the new musical arrangement. It's just art.  Lo mejor que puedo escuchar, es esto, esta banda.   Fan desde México
Falling in reverse is music and everything else is just shit
How to live after that!!?
This song dosen't flow in some spots and just sounds weirdly rushed..
Kind of reminds of Tim Burton’s dark shadows
This is so extra... I love it.
Bro… this is a whole damn movie..
He needs to play the Phantom on broadway. Change my mind
this just came into my recomendations and damn, i'm not dissapointed, those vocals are really awesome
The woman looks ridiculous tho
This IS flawless! I'm not fond of his past. Whatever. His musical talent is flat out superior to anybody in my generation....1980's on. Nobody has been able to show this kind of variance as well as display in video after video. Every single one is an absolute masterpiece.
I think Ronnie's been listening to Meatloaf
We really need a "Revisited" album... Ronnie revisits his album... 🥰
My favorite vampire song is still https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNKRCyXogWk  I honestly think this song could have been written better. However, this song's video is epic. It makes me wonder how much it cost to produce.
yessssss!
WHY IS THIS LITERAL PERFECTION… oh wait. I must’ve forgot who I’m listening to.
太猛了吧 好聽到哭....
I was a overdose sin before I was a slit wrist sin.. Not to forget the puppy dewormer.. For some reason Gods the only reason I'm alive.. God cheated me from death.. I cut right on the vain down to the thumb.. The only part that didn't try to self heal was what I was sticking my finger through.. Afterward the Illuminati owe me more then 800 after my half suicide....
I swear for the longest time, I thought the line that says "My head is spinning from this, blurry vision" was "My head is always spinning from this, physical revision"
My goodness Ronnie is a legend! Its a hundred time I listen to this but still can't get enough
So Ronnie brought Paige back to life only for her to kill her self? I wanted to see her in the end with a shit ton of male servants after Ronnie died  i.e. Celeste Von Ludenberg style.
Just when I thought the perfect orgasm didn’t exist 🤯🤯🤯🤯🥴🤤
3m48. His voice with the fucking chore in back. God damn I can't
This was the first falling in reverse song I heard. That was years ago. This just about made me shed a tear. Time to dig up the eyeliner!
Paige ❤️
God simply amazing, as always. Rock on forever Ronnie🤘
Only after watching this multiple times I realized the monk choir are actually the same guys that captured him in the end.
3:40 God damn...  I just can't get away from this fucking remake, its hitting me on all the levels a song almost never has. If you even slightly know what its like to be dead inside, to feel so cold that it turns you into a monster, this video is just so damn telling. All I can see is myself breaking, screaming, phew, damn.
Охренеть, я просто слов не могу подобрать, что б описать все эмоции, что переполняют меня после просмотра!
Damn!! What a rebirth!!!
Man so talented he even revamped Paige
Ronnie radke, Sonny Moore, Oliver Sykes & Davey Havok skill level is of something different than most, i think. \m/ ( > <) \m/
This is %^#€ great!
Whens the movie coming out? 🥺
Where is the tattoo...
Paige gorgeous as ever
Cada vez que vejo esse clipe é como se me queimassem viva tbm, fico emocionada por um casal que nem existe socofro
Eu choro toda vez que escuto
Literalmente,esta canción es para mi funeral... 🔥💔🔥Rocío Carolina Gauto 1995-2030 🔥💔🔥...llega el fin del mundo...🎁
The title to this song is very misleading.
The song should be titled I'm not a vampire I'm just emo
Sooo..... My new favorite song. Honestly I didn't hear or remember the original until I heard the revamped version. The Revamped is just something brilliant. It is probably the best song I have heard this year and I am so happy this type of music is making a big comeback with new twist and subgeneres!
Garbage in comparison. Not just MY opinion.. lol.
Holy crap listening to this was an EXPERIENCE. Like, It felt as if something was trying to pull me back the more intense it got, I legit can’t explain this feeling of pure joy and satisfaction. This song gives off an incredible feeling of shock, especially with headphones on!
Absolute masterpiece.
oh my god please make more like this , utterly mesmerizing!
You gotta stop doing this to me sir Ronnie. EVERY time you release something it's absolutely AMAZING and I'm reminded of "my type" all over 😩🥰 I don't even have a sufficient emoji for my feelings lol
love the reimagines and the cinematic style! absoloutly beautiful :o
"I feel like a lady who is pregnant with a baby because I'm always throwing up." What? Like What? This song is so bad lol. No. Stop it. Get some help.
OHMERGAWD THIS IS AMAZING. I have no words for this one I LOVE your recent remakes. *Swoons*
Wonderfull
I made my cat listen to this with me......... hes edgy now
This version is definitely superior in every way. I strongly feel it should’ve been sung and played this way to begin with
2:40   Oh Ronnie, you've come a long way ♡
He just to be soo good now this shit is trash
Another fkn masterpiece!!
A Alberto del río no le va a gustar este vídeo 😂
Can someone explain the storyline of the video?? I keep getting distracted by Ronnie’s hair!!
They did really well with this me and my brother used to be unsepriable but now he's really mean to me and I haven't done anything wrong and I'm upset about it and my oldest brother I haven't seen him since I was 5 and he's 25 now and I really miss him by a lot I love you if you're watching this casey
Lyrics are exquisite
I love you Ronnie, thanks for this amazing version this is better than sex and better than everything.
All of the comments are talking about the quality music video. And not about how it is in memory of the guitarist.
When you realize you only loved Escape The Fate and Falling in Reverse because Ronnie writes.
ronnie has one of the best voices i've ever heard. been a fan of falling in reverse for 6 years now and he never fails to amaze me. love him.
oh my 🖤🤍 😳
And this is where I belong to
did anyone else know that the girl is paige of of wwe! fit thge role pefectly, i knew i recognised her
jesus Christ
This is masterpiece
Damn this song has turned really dark it's amazing.
Carmilla and cecilion 🤣
i yhink i knew this house, is the same of better od death from sleaping with sirens?????can someone tell me please
sorry, but i can't take this version seriously HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Damn that was dope!!
Still here after 4 months and I love this song like it was the first day
Damn... Look at him 😍😍
support from Belgium
I got so many chills. I wish I could go back to when I didn't see this so I could experience it again.
Omg I have honestly never loved a music video so much in my life 😍 please this guy needs a Grammy or something 🏆 x
I have never heard of any Falling in reverse song or even Ronnie Radke. But I stumble across this song and it's an understatement to say that I was blown away. I guess I should start listening the this band. oh my f*ck.
whaaaat the fuuuuck. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Huh!!!!!!!!!!
Is the a response to the South Park vampires?   Seriously tho, good work and great song. <3
Ronnie meets Phantom of the Opera
i heard this song first then i heard the original .... aint gonna lie i wouldve never paid attention to the lyric in the original but in this one its like way better
surely a grammy?
🧛🏼🧛🏼🧛🏼🧛🏼🧛🏼✨✨✨✨
Masterpiece!!!!
_sigh_  *right click* *loop*
maaan, I don't know why but this just makes me feel so happy  3:40 damn, found my favorite part
😱just..😍😱🙌
I love them revamping the songs. All I have to say is DAMN. I have goosebumps up my back. Omg
This is delicious.
Wow! That's amazing!
Just 👏🏻
i watch this at least 20 times a day
OH MY GOSH!! THE EDITING AND FILMING WAS PHENOMENAL!
I wonder if they'll do the same with the song "bad girls club"
sounds like joel faviere
And… I’m emo again.
This is awesome! I can't believe I'm just now catching this video.
At this point FiR should compose a musical with all their old songs remastered.
Ich liebe diesen Song... Gewaltig gut... 👌♥️ Stimmvolumen ist super, Video auch sehr gut ♥️
Grande
This is a beautiful video!
Truth being spoken.,,.
This is not a song it is an expression
as a fellow addict (sober 8.5years), thank you for continuing to make music. this is absolutely amazing. there are no words for how beautiful + powerful this is.
Wow when the hell Paige from WWE get a nose job?
"So God bless all of you now, cause I'm goin straight to hell. And I'm takin you down with me, because you know damn well."  This part of the song hits a lot harder in the feels than I wish it did.
Amazing
Not only a talented dark arts and potions master, but also a great singer
🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤Oh my f@#$ing God 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
This is incredible, amazin absolutly WOW
This is the first time I've listened to this. Never listened to the original neither. Honest reaction is this is powerful, good stuff.
this shit sucks ngl
Great. I wish it was an actual movie length film. Like 2 hrs 45 mins. Then video was great like I said. This could be a next big hit in theaters and the box office.😘 Then again I not accurate.
Amazing!!
oh shit, i'm sure if ronnie is an actor and made movies, he would be one of the best actors in the catalog.
DAMN! Thank you for going from Glam to 'Evanescence' Style, speechless
I loved this one so much more than the original
this song was awsome the orignel was great but this i new level:)
This is a film not a song
Ronnie....... wtf is this? 😐
This is fucking sick why am I obsessed with it 😂
My girl Paige killed this
I’m speechless
I really liked "the drug in me reimagined", that was powerful and sexy,  this one is also so good. The guy is so talented !
Falling in reverse is so underrated
he turn it into a totally different song tho
Here comes the feel good delta variant.
This is amazing. So so amazing.
I love this video ,i love this song ❤️ Grandi Falling in reverse
fire
2:38 hi my name is ronnie
dude...this is like...hot
I’m freaking late but I’m freaking here and I’m freaking happy about it.
Wow!  Reminds of Romeo and Juliet.
03:19 No thanks to me
Ronnie…. You’re a fucking GOD
Красивый клип
ensnaring lyrics and eye candy of a music video, I can't stop adding this to playlists it doesn't fit in.
I'll never forget this band or Ronnie Radke. I went to a Falling in Reverse concert the last time I saw my dad alive.  FIR is in constant rotation in my car. Why are no bands coming out nearly as awesome as them?  Thank you, FIR, and thank you, family
o único crime dessa música é ter 6 minutos
Who's the ladie?
Master piece
I love this!!!!!! make a movie!!!!
Trash 🗑
Just realised why he looks so naked they covered all his tattoos wow love him with or without both ways he’s beautiful
Hey Ronnie, pick a genre... Nah, I'll just create a masterpiece instead.
That moment when you see his face and think”wait… where’s the lit tats that were there yesterday???” Lmao
♥
Wow twilight who? This clip is better than many movies
it`s fucking AMAZING!!!! привіт з України!!
Listened to this absolute masterpiece about a thousand times and it still sends crazy shivers down my spine.
Gave me chills. Awesome song Ronnie. Please audition for the next big vampire movie. It suits you to a T
damn the 180 degree transformation
all I can say is holy fuck..
perfeição 👌🏻
whos the girl?
THIS LITERALLY GIVES ME CHILLS HOLY SHIT
Okay but like how is this possible? I thought vampires aren't visible on camera 🤔
Супер!!!!
Whats her name? She's beautiful!
my english is bad. but i like the sounds.
The Dark Shadows reboot is looking good
holy shit
honestly this guy is an amazing musician the classic musicians would be proud of him
I FUCKING LOVE THIS. I LOVE RHONNIE SO MUCH.THIS IS SO BEAUTIFUL.
Holy shitttt🔥🔥🔥 what a master piece. So impressed 👏👏
I just noticed.....re-VAMP-ed......:D
I found happiness because I can relate in so many profound ways. Thank you Falling in reverse for your music.
My taste in music is now revamped
90438490834 times I've watched this and it still hasn't gotten old.
your music has so much emotion to them it gave me the chills, you new song is amazing can't wait what you bring out next
I love how he chose “revamped” as opposed to “reimagined” very fitting
You. Are. God
This was beautiful. And the tribute to Derek at the end, 😭
since 12 feb I can't live without this song.
LYRICS im not a vampire but i feel like one sometimes i sleep all day,because i hate the sunlight my hands are always shaking bodies always achin and the dark is when i feed i can lure any woman that i want to in my bed with me  and whiskey seems to be my holy water mothers better lock your doors and hide your daughters  im insane i can feel it in my bones coursing through my veins when did i become so cold? for goodness sakes, where is my self control? if home is where my heart is then my heart has lost all hope  im not a zombie but i feel like one today self induced,comatose,chemical daze my head is always spinning from this dizzy blurry vision and my stomach has had enough i feel like a lady that is pregnant with a baby cause im always throwing up.  hi my name is ronnie im an addict (HI RONNIE!) daddy should've never raised me on black sabbath  im insane i can feel it in my bones coursing through my veins when did i become so cold? for goodness sakes, where is my self control? if home is where my heart is then my heart has lost all hope
What an amazing masterpiece,  R.i.p. Derek.... We miss you so much
This is the best song I ever heard😍
Ronnie Radke é um MONSTRO, esse cara canta demais, me arrepio toda vez que ouço essa música
That was so so messed up
Sometimes i just wish to feel just a bit less..
Can we just appreciate Ronnie is just the G.O.A.T Ffs. This mans a style bender.
I love this so much! Paige looks so beautiful in this video, these two make a great couple
I think ghostly woman is what he feels. When he buries the body, he thinks she watches him. When she leaves him, he still feels her looking at him. When he was dying, the ghost (his feelings) died with him. So I think she's alive at the end because he left her on the couch.
I used to be an addict but will always be one even tho i stopped what i did when i was younger when my mother died i was 13 and my baby sister was two year youngers then me i stole my dads meds become a drug addict and an alcoholic all at onced it was too much for me i couldn't take it anymore so i became an suicidal aa alcoholic addict at the age of 13 and was terrified when i almost killed myself 6 months in and finding escape the fate and ronnie radke and fir he saved me and ill forever be grateful for him and his music i wish one day i can meet him and make music with him and do a remake with him with this song in particular bc i feel his pain in this song i understand i sing it everyday and all his music i became a emo gothic kid still one by heart i was raped from the ages of 4 to 7 then it stopped then it started again then i was raped again from 13 to 25 molested etc etc but him his music and bvb all of the greatest emo goth artists helped me thru my life of pain and misery and ill always have that pain and misery it'll never go away i had a daughter from being raped shes 6 and a half now we both are mentally challenged and its okay tho i had a horrible crash in 2013 died from it on the operating table came back to life had her right after all that happened now i have seizures tourettes brain damage can barely walk talk move most days if not all days im usually bed ridden but ronnie is my idle always has been always will be.......love you ronnie radke i understand the struggles of the domestic abuse you did and the other struggles you've been thru they'll turn you into a monster and glad you got thru it all i was abused but i understand you.....glad you are here.....i too am a singer of all types and hope 1 day i can be making music like you and with you...I HOPE YOU SEE THIS COMMENT
que wea mas mala
Это просто ахуенно
Seriously: THIS WAS FUCKING AMAZING !!!   JOKING: Has anyone checked on falling in reverse lately?  They are not okay 😢
this is a masterpiece
I wish this was a full length movie...So awesome!
От этого клипа исходят Оскары 🏆
Jesus the power and emotion in his voice
Ronnie Cullen?
Wow
Waw amazing
THIS WAS FR BETTER THAN ANYYYY HORROR MOVIE IVE EVER WATCHED.  This song has been in my head for weeks.  I looked it up and it’s “reVAMPED”, I got sooo stoked.  Especially since he used the same Piano stripped sound he did for The Drug in Me is You a friend showed me recently.  Obsessed w the rawness.   ((not to mention my FAVORITE instrument//sound is the piano & violin then acoustics)) Ronny Radke has always been somewhere near the top of my list—all my life consisted of before were bands, shows, merch etc lol  due to chronic pain health conditions I haven’t had any quality of life :( incredibly hard now to even keep personal relationships alive.  I’ve shook the hand of doubt; FR I FUCKING felt the hand of darkness as it tried to pull me down.  And unlike his lyrics, I REFUSE to bring anybody down with me !  Lonely af but I’m meant to go thru this last dark knight of the soul.  There is this guy I am in love with and cannot get him off my mind. There’s so much I want to scream & shed light for he ones I love... of what the truth is.  I’ve been burning in my own hell for years... past week? The temperature was cranked up.  It’s torture, but I’m starting to feel my old shell shedding.   This is like my 10th time listening to this today so far😂😂😭 love this band more than anything & INSANE how my fav album of ALL TIME, nothing NOBODY CAN REPLACE THEM NOR EVER TAKE THEIR PLACE.... it’s “Dying is Your Latest Fashion” when he was lead singer for Escape the Fate.  Oh my god...  I know every lyric like it was written inside me.  Brings me immense nostalgia too, perhaps why I stopped listening to bands for years.  Idk... but god bless man.  I’m blessed for this masterpiece thats alllls I gots to say🤗
Wow!  My husband and I are metal people who love vampiric imagery, but had never heard of the band "Falling in Reverse."  One day last week, I was perusing YouTube videos and thought, "Hmm, I'll give this a listen."  Let me tell you...at the beginning I was intrigued.  "This isn't the typical vocal style I like, but it's great."  And I appreciated the passion and cinematography.  By the end of the song...CHILL BUMPS ALL OVER.  This song is a masterpiece, and I appreciate all of the creativity put into it.  What a work of art all around!  Ronnie Radko/Falling in Reverse have my admiration for bringing such beauty!
Crazy!!
Yooo is that Paige!?
why?
I'm gonna be mad if this isn't in Morbius
Adoro o som
I honestly thought this would be ok but I’m pleasantly surprised that this is truly immaculate
This gave me chills down my spine
Masterpiece.
I love you paigee 🖤🔥
this was amazing… i’m shell shocked
Loved watching this man grow up, his range is all over the scales and he's finally using everything he has. Ronnie has came so far over the years. Patiently waiting for more, he out does himself every single time.  P.S. This man has saved my life more times than I can count.
Wait, but he said he wasn't a vampire. D:
i feel like i just watched twilight
Love this
Can someone PLEASE make it a thing, that we have the old song with the new music video? That'd be awesome xP
🔥🔥🔥
Шикарный клип, мурашки по коже🖤
THIS. IS. A. MASTERPIECE.
Vinyl record for sale?

Whiskey is my holy water - amen brother

Crap
Прекрасная музыка, великолепная картинка в кадре, изумительно!!

Ronni is the greatest artist in the fucking history!!!! i cant believe this, its a totally different history with the same song. this is fucking insane
OMG It's awesome ❤ All this 6 minutes I was sitting but It was like I was there and feeling what they felt. Congratulations!!!!!!❤❤❤
Season 9 of TVd
I'LL F♡KING ANIMATE THIS!!!!
I didn't even realize it was paige from the wwe, great pick
Omg goosebumps
I wish I could listen to I'm not a vampire revamped for the first time again!
Can we please have more revamped older music from falling in reverse
This version of the song brings chills and tears to my eyes. It's an overwhelming emotional experience for me.
Fantastic
when is the musical happening ?
wwe paige?
The absolute cinematic and musical beauty this is is just * chefs kiss *   Absolutely stunning 🤟🏻
3:50 through 4:20 1 me over but I was already practically there This thing deserves an Oscar
They clearly go bored during covid. But its amazing!
Кто здесь по рекомендации Элины Федоровой ? 😁
Genius
I have to be half something to survive what I did to myself..
So weird to see it turn into this, but my emo days are gone, this is cool tbh
Missed opportunerty to say " I am vampire and i feel like one"
Just when i thought i couldn't find Ronnie any more attractive..15yrs emo me in quaking inside my soul. love this so much 😭😭💖
Best music video
This is so underrated... Like why... This is art
Paige 😍🥰🖤
Beautiful song
🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🔥
This type of music I can vibe with
ENORMISIME💖💀💣
So I liked the original, but I am in love with this one
Omg! Amazing song, amazing movie!!!
Hear me out. Falling in Reverse theater tour. Complete with an orchestra, choir, and a ballet…
THAT’S WHAT I’M FUCKING TALKING ABOUT RONNIE!! This took me back the same way the guillotine 4 took me back to your etf days
The video is of course absolutely stunning. But that song, that VOICE... I'm speechless. This is beyond perfection. There's so much talent in this man.
All I'm saying is he should of turned into a bat
This is amazing! Loved in then and now!❤️
nem
i'm sorry what ?
💛💛💛💛💛💛
I just stumbled across this, thought it was a spoof-  unholy frikkin bejebus how awesome is this!? Why wasn’t it already in my life!?  So many lines hit home & expressed so powerfully with an amazing voice Musical cinematic pure genius- right there 🙌🧛‍♂️ Update: I’ve spent the past 2 days literally stalking Falling in Reverse (don’t judge me for not already knowing them- I’m old 😂)  Omg! Downloaded all albums, songs been on repeat, I wake with this song in my head & go to sleep with it still playing.  I’ve no words for the raw talent & pure genius of Ronnie to do him justice.  I grew up on Metallica, Megadeath, Slayer etc…my kids had Disturbed, HIM, Bullet for my Valentine. SOAD, played to them in womb lol. Thank you YouTube algorithm for popping this up on my feed & bringing new (to me) life to my playlists 🙌
Кто пришёл сюда после интервью Элины: лайк 👍🏻  P.S. Это шедевр!!!
I remeber listing to the original version for the first time years ago I'm glad I was listen to that song still but now i can feel fancy as I do it
Was kind of hoping Paige would of clotheslined somebody NGL
This felt like a twighlight flash back lol i love it
Well, I'm not a vampire But I feel like one Sometimes I sleep all day Because I hate the sunlight My hands are always shaking Body's always aching And the dark is when I feed  Well, I can lure any woman that I want to in my bed With me And whiskey seems to be my holy water Mothers better lock your doors And hide your daughters  I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness' sakes Where is my self control? If home is where my heart is Then my heart has lost all hope  Well, I'm not a zombie But I feel like one today Self-induced comatose, chemical daze  My head is always spinning From this dizzy, blurry vision And my stomach has had enough I feel like a lady That is pregnant with a baby 'Cause I'm always throwing up  Hi, my name is Ronnie I'm an addict (Hi, Ronnie) Daddy should've never raised me on Black Sabbath  I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness' sakes Where is my self control? If home is where my heart is Then my heart has lost all hope  God bless all of you now 'Cause I'm going straight to hell And I'm taking you down with me 'Cause you know damn well  I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold?  I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness' sakes Where is my self control? If home is where my heart is Then my heart has lost all hope All hope All hope
Every time I hear Ronnie's voice I can't help but think really loudly in my head "SITUATIONSSSS"
Not saying I don't like the song. But I stg, How come they redo The drug in me is you and then that blows up so they milk it and do another...and probably another at some stage. Kinda mad but as I said ain't a bad song
The part at 5:03 to the end just gives me chills that range and screaming. God. 👌
Nothing has ever given me goosebumps like this. Popular Monster gave me serious goosebumps, but this is on another level entirely.   It’s beautiful, poignant, theatrical and immensely powerful.   The emotions, the delivery, the lyrics and the music ... wow. Sensational stuff.   I seriously hope there’s more of this.
I want a live version. Please
The girl vampired  died at the sun rising because she was AFK.🌞🥵🔥☠️
This is the first time I listen to Falling in Reverse and I've listening this song non stop for a few days now. It's a whole experience. I've been listening more of their music but this one right here is still my favorite. It's the drama and the opera that speaks to me lol And his voice is just WOW. Please, if anyone knows similar artists or bands, let me know their names.
Wow, how did I not come across this 😳, another amazing song by Ronnie, well done 🔥
Спасибо Евгению за видео 🖤
no
*Sees title of song* So it’s reverse Tommy Wiseau?   Idc if I’m the only one who gets the joke that shit was hilarious
What is one supposed to do when hell is earth and heaven is imaginary?...
DEMASIADO ARRECHO!!!!!🤩
LOL! Of Couse You aqre, YOU FN LEACH!  Whqat caqn I do, to feed you qaqnd then send you, upon your wqaqyQQ?QQ??
You don’t believe me? Should I write it in ✨ Blood ✨
Fucking masterpiece
This video needs more views
I had never heard of them and then I went to one of their concerts years and years and years ago and I'm so glad I did. Everything he touches is gold
i love how this music video is free ❤️
I can see this in a vampire horror movie
Pleace, remake all your song Revamp style, they are briliant, i am almost 60 y old and i love rock but your remake are awsome, love and stay well.
охуенно
So cool thanks
Очень круто!
👍👍👍
MASTER PIECE!
I can't stop watching thisssssss
OH MY GOD!!!! THIS IS PERFECTION JUST BREATHTAKING!!! Please give this guy an award!!
This whole song sends chills though fr
This hits hard asf
de end of the song remind of the disney film beauty and de beast😅
i dont care what anyone says yea ronnie  fought and wrestled with his fair share of demons in the past and been to jail a few times but hes brilliant and in all honesty his music  is  inspiring and uplifting more then anything hes one of the few artist where you can tell hes giving you a story  through the music thats why hes brilliant he reminds me of chris cornell profound in the sense hes probably the greatest modern rock star i know cuz i like alot of ones thats passed away like chris cornell chester benninton and scott weiland but one of the few great rockers in this time era with deep potent lyrics and versatile  vocals and banging musicians around him is this guy right here ronnie hes excellent
I cant count the times I've listen to this song! When he started singing I got chills! This is an absolute master piece 👏  love all of his songs my favorite artist of all. I introduced him to my parents and they love him! ❤ genius
"Hi my name is Ronnie, and i'm an addict" fucking felt that line
Wow this music video like a movie
holy shit!!! This is amazing!!!
Wow ❤️
Awesome great video
Luv it
Ronnie reminds me of Thomas Sharpe from Crimson Peak
A piece of the master! 🌕🙌
Amooooooo 🖤
Holy shit 5:35 till the end that is a powerful voice
Getting huge Lestat vibes from Ronnie
This version of the song would be such a great theme song for the Castlevania series!
Fuck man.... I felt this to my core
Niiiiiiice
THIS IS INSANE!!! I LOVE IT, WOW!!!!!! So fucking powerfull, what an experience!!!
🙋🏼‍♀️HEY RONNIE,  Okay is official, I can’t live without this video, I just downloaded it on ALL of my IPads, IPhone, and computer. I want to say just how amazing your voice is in this. You really should do more songs like this one. I love this so much I have been sharing it on Twitter and Facebook. I want everyone to hear this. Dee🥰
I can’t stop watching this remake video. It is a true piece of art. It turned a song that was a poppy, rock song and turned it into a rock opera. Every time I watch it I can’t believe it’s the same song. BRAVO 👏  Ronnie. Whoever directed the video and did the cinematography  BRAVO 👏 This truly deserves some kind of award 🥇. In on word INCREDIBLE !😁👍
5:30 mark till 5:47.. like..👀👀👀👀👀👀😭😭😭😭🖤🖤🖤
The production value of this is absolutely incredible. As a long time fan I love it.
It's Paige😮😮😮. When did she start shooting music video??
This was amazing 🤘🤘
Oooh! I'm loving these! 👁👁💕💕💕 such nice nostalgia
that`s so f*cking nice
This is just superior in so many aspects
I’m only two minutes I’m but I love this version way more than the original. That’s my opinion.
he looks so nice without tats its so weird
okay this is amaxing
The gothic horror aesthetic kind of reminds me of old school Cradle of Filth, Motionless in White and Malice Mizer, only in terms of visuals of course haha. Awesome remake nonetheless!
This is the kind of drama i'm into
I love it!!!!!
Ronnies been on that Dani filth diet. Not bad.
loving this! Also the drug in me reimagined.. A fan back in the day and I still am!! <3
this clip is better than many films
I find quite poetic the way Ronnie goes from "𝓦𝓮𝓵𝓵, 𝓘'𝓶 𝓷𝓸𝓽 𝓪 𝓿𝓪𝓶𝓹𝓲𝓻𝓮, 𝓫𝓾𝓽 𝓘 𝓯𝓮𝓮𝓵 𝓵𝓲𝓴𝓮 𝓸𝓷𝓮"  to  "M҉O҉T҉H҉E҉R҉F҉U҉C҉K҉E҉R҉,҉ ҉ I҉'҉M҉ ҉ A҉ ҉V҉A҉M҉P҉I҉R҉E҉ "  #talentedAF
This was absolutely awful. The music and lyrics don't flow at all. His voice is like nails on a chalkboard. Garbage.
actual fucking goosebumps omg
Me: *sharpens my canine teeth and gets fancy goth dresses* THATS RIGHT PEOPLE. I AM NO LONGER ASHAMED-
I connected to this song in my 20s..... I connect to it in my 30s.....
Ronnie is the only reason I haven't killed myself in the last 8 years since I started listening , don't get me wrong , my depression and suicidal thoughts get stronger every day ..,, but I keep telling myself , not until you meet Ronnie
Name actress?
This is a fantastic remake. I love how you took a song that use to be a  kind of poppy, upbeat, rock song and turned it into a theatrical rock opera. NICE REVAMP 🧛🏻  😁👍
Lookin like the singer of type o
much better than the previous version, and the video is great .. rock, dark, dramatic, epic, the vocal is nice to hear on the headphones
Why is there Paige like twice?
This Guy is next level
Realmente sigo sin superar tremenda obra de arte
You don’t know how talented you have to be to turn a song into a new song using the same lyrics,it blows my mind
I got here because of YouTube reccomendation, and not regret it's worth it 🖤.
I listened to the original, and I loved it, and I listened to this AND ITS AMAZING, his voice is beautiful!
Wow... Just wow. 👌
Could you imagine if he did this with Asshole or Alone? 😂  But seriously though 😏
Man, I loved Ronnie’s voice before this, but this takes it to a whole other level
Am I the I my one that loves the new verses?
Got out your old skinny jeans😂😂
Ya ever just say fuck it and make a movie, a masterpiece and deserve literally every award for music there is?
Ronnie will be good in a vampire movie
Infinitamente mejor que el original
YASSSS  Bruh.. That was the best thing i have ever watched hands down😩 Chills. Literal chills
It’s been a while since I saw some fresh art on YouTube. I think I have a new fav song genre
I would watch the feature film version of this and pay for the privilege tbh.
Yay paige!!
He really mixed opera, screamo and rock. Masterpiece.
That transition on "Black Sabbath" though. 🤔
I want his Wardrobe. . .
i really hope he keeps doing these... its wayy too perfect
A masterpiece! I have no other words for it and thats not because of my bad english knowledge!
holy shit you need 1b likes for this literly
Revampired
it's hard being a soft girl and at the same time likeing emos music
HOLY FUCKING SHIT I LOVE THIS ITS AMAZINGGGGG!!!!!
Masterpiece...beautiful photography in the shots!
just imagine this, "Raised by Wolves (Rewolved)"
What if he died to be raised by wolves in the next life?
holy FUCK
acting 2/10, music 10/10
Incredible video
Speechless 😶
This song gave me chills  Love from India ♥️
Idk how y’all worship this dude... he is soooo rude to everyone and acts like he is gods gift to the world! He about to catch some 💨! Y’all see next show he does 💯
This is a work of art I love this song way too much
With the mv popular monster, now this, is straight up underworld lycan movie series with the touch of dracula movie but all in one and better, wish it could be a movie, the story has potential like big.
Short boring scene 🤣 Templar HQ:  Soldier: "Commander, the last male vampire is dead."  Comander: "Good, sweep the mansion."  Soldier 2: "Sir, we have identified a new vampire, female, very beautiful."  Commander: "Hold the operation, monitor the individual."                           YEARS LATER Soldier 3: "Sir, we have an update, the female vampire has awaken."  Commander: "Keep on monitoring"                          HOURS LATER Soldier 3: "Sir, the female vampire is dead."  Commander: ". . . . "  Soldier 3: "Orders sir?"  Commander: "Sweep the area and destroy the place, find anything that is valuable and interesting."  WONDERING.....  Commander: "How and why did she'd be dead, I was planning to make her a weapon well, **it happens. Moving on!"
Hey guys, Check out this awesome new post-hardcore band “ I, Werewolf “ https://youtu.be/mLKgcBoTUVA
So in love with this, i just need more!! 🖤
Ah, fuck.  I thought I left that life behind me. 🕵 I thought it wouldn't come back to get me.  Turns out, it's inescapable.  And the scariest thing is... I don't think I want to escape it.  **pulls out eyeliner and pure black clothing**
Grammy 🗣
I feel like a lady that is pregnant with a baby....... It sounded like a emo blues song
Lol wtf?
Did he just make himself into a Lycan cause he certainly ain't a Cullen.
I'm here just waiting of him to do a master piece out of Caught Like a Fly pls Ronny PLSSSS
God this is such a work of art
Ronnie, it really beautiful. How great u are!
I believe Ronnie announced that this video was nominated for 6 awards! It was very well deserved :)
Misunderstood... i can never be the same again......
One thing i could tell from this song is like enjoying the evolution of ronnie,
just perfect
Cada vez mais apaixonada por ele ..... sem palavras pra explicar !!!!!!
Okay, I'll be honest. This is goddamned awesome. I'm the last person who would be an emo punk kiddie, but congrats. You won me.
great vibes
Your Real Brothers will not Allow you to go to HELL
Woah
This is Art from the soul .. A FUCKING MASTERPIECE 🖤
2:39 aaaaaand... this whole thing is amazing!
Best vampire movie I've ever seen so far 😏
I remember when i first listened to this as a kid and i saw myself reflecting in the lyrics ... sad part is it's still the case except i don't get laid
Twilight take notes...
damn who is that woman :O
Shit this version really send shiver down my spine for fuck sake
Cagou
Wow! Just wow
3:50 tho-
Vocals kinda remind me of ludo except better! Nice song
why is this so perfect?
Rest in peace Derek Jones
La interpretación de Ronnie me hace sentir que ha sido un vampiro toda su vida y nosostros no lo sabíamos.
🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺 Ronnie, you never fail us. Thank you for all that you do. Don’t listen to the haters and keep up the ungodly amazing work! You rock!!!❤️
This makes all other music seem bland and poorly composed. Is there anything else like this from any other groups that I missed? This was just amazing. My favourite track ever.
Great Update. And we love that Paige from WWE is in this video.
The worst part of the videoclip is that it ends
Can we talk about how beautiful looks his girlfriend Paige😍
If this doesn't get an Oscar, a mob will be created, I swear.
👏👏👏👏👍👍👍👍👍👍😊😊😊😊🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
Was anyone else getting really into the story of the music video
All the chills this gave me😧 THIS IS SO GOOD!!
* sighs * here we go again
.... She's got to be the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in my life.
Oops iam 59 soon 60 but this is some of the best iv seen on YouTube 👍
It's still weird seeing Ronnie with no tattoos and wearing a shirt lol
I'd love to see NF and Ronnie collab in a rock rap track! They're both lyrical geniuses and have real subject matter.
Fun Fact. Dracula got hurt by light but he couldn’t die by it.
It's very Ice Nine Kills of them haha
Ronnie is probably the metal singer more talented in the world

Masterpiece 😌
Cuanto más escucho esta canción, más me enamora @😍😍😍
It’s Not just a Song, it’s a Masterpiece!
Just went and listened to the original....  This one is way better.
where's my black dress i need my black nailpolish ASAP
Nothing says "I'm *definitely* not a vampire" like having a full monk choir accompanying you.
Yo this made it to 5 million views! Next Goal make it 10 million!!!!! [This song deserves veiws in the Billions]
This reminded me of a modern day version of something Queen would do... of course, I can't compare because they are both very different, but my point is this is absolutely beautiful and I love the dramaticness of it.
RONNIE. My guy I'm seriously impressed with these vocals. Like, your pitch is flawless and you have nearly perfect control even on really difficult notes. Your voice has always been good, but I didn't know it could be this pretty ❤
Who else had some serious Jekyll and Hyde vibes from this?????
Obra de arte
Ronnie's just showing off now. 🖤
Tommy Wiseau?
This has no right being this beautiful
Revamped. I see what you did there.
I'm like this song, my teen version was pure energic emo girl, and my adult version is just an emo tragedy
getting a meatloaf I would do anything for love vibe
Great video!!  Also PAIGE!!
Why you ruin a perfectly good song. Great voice but crap retake soz
Since when loki became vampire ?
It was great.
He looks really healthy tbh. Are you sober?

Que es esta mierda en serio  wtf???
re-vamped instead of reimagined lmao...
This is a masterpiece. Period.
This song gives me chills, the original one was just like a party song where it was as if he was a fuck boy who prayed on people and their emotions. This one? It sounds as if he is hiding who he is, when his girlfriend realizes he is hiding something she runs, then comes back and finds out who he is, he runs. He is scared of who he is and what he is capable of. He is running from his true self, the ending... he owned who he was he was a vampire. He owned it, even if it meant he was going to be killed/hated for who he is. His music is just aging with him.
Omg....amazing...I'm sure they hear it all the time...but for reals..best ever music video I've ever seen....orgasmic, chills, shivers, butterfly's, vocals and song are out of this world...I can't wait to hear and see more in the future...ronnie wow...DWAMN👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Ok...GOAT!
It's great on mute!  Now who's the babe?
congratulations on this beautiful job, better than a hollywood movie
I've never seen something like that before. So epic!
When you can feel the power of a song down into the depths of your emo soul 🖤    RONNIE IS FUCKING TALENTED AF
That was.... Overwhelming...
Lol 'revamped' good pun
am i the only one seeing that that girl looks like Leah Michelle
When I first heard this song I was into emo music and stuff. Now I'm goth loving everything connected with vampires and I feel like some things I loved before will stay with me forever🖤 This version of song and video is so mesmerizing
I get kind of a Meatloaf vibe from FIRs videos. I used to love watching those when I was a kid.
Absolutely amazing!! Beautiful!!!
Showed this to my very metal loving other half...his exact words... HOLY SHIT AMAZEBALLS!!! ❤️ Couldn't have put it better myself.
I’m reborn at last
The beginning sounds like Mr. Crowley so much so i was almost waiting to hear ozzy say Mr Crowley
Van Helsing is coming!
Legend.  God.
RONNIE... That was a bloody master piece! Dude that was absolutely amazing! Now that my friend is real art!
Guess I'm becoming emo again 😔
🥲 beautiful 🤩🧛🏽‍♀
OMG! I'M 48 and border line obsessed with this band. Not only is the front man one of the best singer I've ever heard, but the entire band is extremely talented. Love it
I have no words…….oh yes I do amazing, epic, emotional, a masterpiece i am revitalized by the it’s totality.
Teenage me: omg omg omg it's been revamped!  Adult me: This was absolutely astounding and I think I just watched a full blown Broadway in 6 minutes o.o
I like the revamped version much better!  I liked the original, but this one is the definitive version in my eyes.  Like if you agree
Why does the dress of the woman in this vid look like the same dress as lady dimitrescu's dress
Ни разу в жизни ничто не вызывало во мне столько эмоций, как вызывают по сей день эта песня и этот клип. Я восхищена. Ничего никогда так точно не описывало мое душевное состояние. Гениальная, просто великолепная работа
Cheesy ass lyrics
I'm about to cry and don't know why... this is just beautiful!👏👏
if there’s anyone i know who for sure ISNT a vampire it’s Ronnie. he literally told us twice now
Es genial.
“In loving memory of Derek Jones” 🥺🥺
Just, Wow.
Most beautiful song by falling in reverse
2:40
Paige is a Goddess in this video♥️
Anyone know the woman's name?
Awesome... Love it
The soundtrack of this movie was amazing!
award winning music video - well deserved
I got chills.... Like on every inches of my body  This is SO F*CKIIING GOOD!!!!!!!
Better than twilight
Just realized you had falling in reverse and architects. So how do I get on your level?????????
Severus is that you
the guy should star in a vampire movie....
my heart (':
Twilight version*
Phantom who?!
I love these so much
The og is better honestly
This is what I'll introduce as classical music to my children.
Low key Maya Deren vibes.  This is so nostalgic. Such a throwback and I love it. Amazing job you guys! 🎉🔥🤟
Did no one else catch the 're-VAMP-ed' camp for vampire
He has such a great voice
Mr. Radke you are a musical fucking genius..... keep it up man!!!!!
This masterpiece just came out 3 months ago and I have not seen it WHAT!!!
I am 100% convinced he IS a vampire. Also it feels like H.I.M but like....a younger version??
Omg. Yes feeling all the feelings again with this one. 💛
Wow... Chills. My childhood favourite song has a hot big brother 😍
Congrats on the awards! 😃💗🎉 Well done, Ronnie & Saraya!
Dudes only getting better creatively
This was freaking immaculate
King Louis vibes
Who’s here cause Paige put it on her Twitter?
What in the interview with a vampire?
The way the song gradually descends into madness is fucking beautiful. Ronnie is a living legend man.
I don't know why I thought of this but it feels like a ballad by Louis de Pointe du Lac.  (Anyone else an Anne Rice fan? no? just me? okay. *quietly slinks away*)
The best expression song!!!
lol this a movie
this is amazing...is fantastic...is epic!
Rip Derek🖤
<3
When he hits that last note at the end, im rendered paralysed for like 10 seconds.
Epic...just Epic!  Loss for words on this one...
Пришла чтобы увидеть режессуру Евгения)
Anyone else think Ronnie kinda looks like Dani Filth right here?
Meatloaf on steroids, or blood ;) muhahahah
Maby Popular Monster Remonstered? <3
I completely loved the visual effects, definitely a badass video

HOW.DID.I.JUST.FIND.THIS.NOW!.!.!
Original is better
Not even comparable to The drug in me is reimagined. I mean this is all right but don't compare this to that because one is all right but the other is a masterpiece.
This is also bloody good!
this is legendary.
dude this is so beautiful what the hell
Holy shit...
Literal… goosebumps 😭💙
I m not a vampire (revamped)= MASTERPIECE
ME ENCANTA PTM QUIERO LLORAR
Fucking masterpiece
This song dark version make me goosebump.. Damn 🤘🖤
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Que absurdo de qualidade!
from 5:01 some of the greatest screaming I have ever heard both delivery and performance 10 / 10
omg I got the chills widjsichdx I remember being an emo kid listening to this now I'm a depressed young adult listening to this :)))
They have a brand new fan in me 😍
This song feels like a water drops on rough stone. I don't know what to say, It's beautiful and I love it!
but does whiskey seem to be your holy water?! literally why I loved the song in the first place, about alcohol addiction, and what about all the peeps you featured in the og vid? now they don't mean shit? don't get me wrong, this is amazing, but kinda kicks loyal people to the curb...
Ronnie Radke: King of melodramatic music videos
What a master piece
original way better lol
"Well I'm not a vampire, but i feel like wood!"
How dramatic you want it to be? Ronnie : 3:50
Holy crap beautiful
5:40 I got goosebumps, it's like a very sick opera!!
ANOTHA ONE JUSKOOO
Remake interview with a vampire with Ronnie as lestat 🤤
This is legendary <3
What a change, I'm in love with it <3 Brings back so many teenage memories
Anyone can explain me the meaning of this song hahaha
💕💕🖤🖤💕💕
Hermoso, ¿cómo me perdí está joyita?
This is so goddamn beautiful
👏👏👏🤘🎶
Did he literally learn piano to turn this into a masterpiece? As if it wasn't already one?
Saraya wow😍
Cool
OMG! this is awesome
I can't get over how BEAUTIFUL THIS IS
Wtf is this and why is it so perfect?  Did we all experience the same character arc over the last 10 years from emo kid to dark aesthetic adult?
I’m watching this for 476579th time and I’m dying for popular monster reimagined. 💀🥱🤧
I didn’t like the reimagined drug in me is you but this one is really good because you can do it both ways. I will still love this og the best bug this one wasn’t bad
The original was a great song that made it seem ronnie took the problems of his addiction as a joke but this this right here is amazing you can feel the pain in the lyrics
I can honestly not tell if this is serious or self satire, but shit hits real hard never the less.  Thanks for the fun Ronnie.
Admit it; atleast a few of you laughed at the vamp pun in the title.  I know I did.  Still a damn beautiful piece of musical and cinematic art.
So, heavy eyeliner and punk boots again. 2021 here we go
Was watching this music video and my cat had to come check on me to see if I was okay.
Ta muito bom pra ser emo
Has anyone seen the Tim Burton film Dark Shadows? This is what the music video reminded me of! I’m in love!!
We need a reimagined version of "Raised by wolves". ❤️❤️❤️
It’s okay if you cried to 😭
Amazing 💓
Never a huge FiR fan here, but damn. That was just a masterpiece. No other word to describe the song + video combination. Major props to Ronnie and also Jensen for directing this thing.
Epic.
A masterpiece of acting, singing and  performing... im speechless here. This deserves a grammy award for the video, this video is the video of the year... this is so powerful, very emotional, im caught into this gloomy gothic opera journey... this song deserves awards.
God bless youtube for recommending me this song 🤲🏻
Love the video, the special effects were unbelievable. It should be a movie. Anyone who says they don't like this, is insane. Fab job
I don’t know about you but those screams would make Chester Bennington proud. Absolutely wicked screams!
Fucking masterpiece!!!!! Brilliant
wow hermosooo el video
omfg Mind blown 😮
Personally I prefer the original...
When emo became goth again
I come here every day
I cried.
My favorite part is when he screams "Motherfucker im a fucking vampire." xD
One of the greatest songs and music videos ever created. Ronnie's vocal talents are mind-blowing, and Sean Rooney's orchestration deserves an award.
Everyone thinks this song is a remake its not ! It's  Radke  Being an Artist  do what U wanna do you inspire my th
😨
So is anyone else starting to think he's a vampire
I can't help but giggle at the lyrics being sung so seriously  *blood on the floor* ; *lightning* *piano* ; *dark academia ambiance* Ronnie: *vibrato* I FEEL LIKE A LADY WHO IS PREGNANT WITH A BABY CUZ I'M *vocal runs* ALWAYS THROWN' UP  It's still a bop - but c'mon that is funny
The people who disliked need to take a covid test, because they have no taste.
Прекрасно по-своему
I love this so much
Wait a fukin moment... This was uploaded 12/02/2021... coincidence? i dont think so, its the same just backwards lol
♥️♥️♥️
Been a fan of both ur bands growing up, haven't heard anything from ESTF in years, been listening too Falling in reverse again last couple years. This song is wonderful 👏 🔥
To call this a masterpiece in an understatement 😱
I don't know why, but in this version when he say Black sabbath i understand rob zombie 🧟‍♂️
Honestly reminds me of Snape in this video lmao
such a amazing song, please promote it more
I was really hoping for some epic black metal screams.
I'm I the only thinks this is a lot like dark shadows with Johnny depp.
The problem is that men don’t dress like this anymore
what a masterpiece. this is my fav fucking thing in the world. thanks ronnie!
I low key want to hear Raised by Wolves as revamped/reimagined lol
Just WOW
Underrated masterpiece ...
YALL TAKING ABOUT RONNIE BIT PAGIE GAAAAAAHHHHH TO AMAZING
It was so SADLY😭😔😢
I enjoyed the original song more... but this music video was GODLIKE!
THIS IS SO AMAZING
Is this supposed to be cheesy and cringe? Like seriously asking
Poha, 👏👏👏. É desse tipo de música que eu gosto!. 🇧🇷
Life should feel like this song sounds <3
It is very good song!
I would really love to see Ronnie work with Fleshgod Apocalypse. I think there's intense music to be made there.
This is very, very good. And I'm a vampire
Its good personally i prefer the og but this is alright just this song is too hard to sang soft and slow
My 4 year old daughter and i love this epic song.Every day she asks me where is Ronnie,and then we watch it together.
I had high hopes. I’m kinda disappointed. This ones good, still a masterpiece because this mans voice is amazing. But I enjoy the original more.
I love how the song's meaning has matured, just like it's main fanbase. The hollow and cocky lyrics have gained a lot of weight, selfishness, narcissism, regret, self reflection. Well fuck.
wowww
Aw shit!!! Here we go again *takes out eyeliner*
senin şarkıların çok güzel daha fazlasını hakediyrosun
Love how paige was in this video. Amazing cinematography
Please start an acting career😂
I swear imma cover this. Almost got it down 100%
I keep forgetting he married Paige lol
This is so beautiful... 😍
This isn't a song. This is an experience.
🐐, BTDubs….is that Paige? Looks like Paige to me in the beginning 🤔……nevermind
ABC
What the fuck he did that bro
4:23
I'm waiting for many others edited old versions. This man deserves an Oscar for music hahaha
I neve knew how good was his voice till listen this fucking song. Man, so freaking damn. I can't count the hours to read his biography "I Can Explain". Lov u so Ronnie!! We all going straigth to hell \../
Best song/remake of the year. Reminds me of Disturbed version of The Sound of Silence.  Applause to Ronnie's vocals & the band.
Dude yes lmao
Que clipe hein👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻caraca muito fodaaaaaa
Where's his body tattoos
Goosebumps !
This is the most Ronnie Radke ever!!! I love it!
I Just Want See This Song Played On Royal Albert Hall likes a BMTH
This was truly unexpected, but I don't dislike it.  It's different from the sound Ronnie put out when I first got into FIR, by a lot actually, but really pretty.  The softness throughout really makes the screaming and heaviness in general toward the end more profound.  Well done.
HI 🙋🏻‍♂️ MY 🤔 NAME 😬 IS 😲 RUNNY 💩 IMENNADDICT 🤒
"revamped"  ah yes.
Si antes me gustaba a hora mas es un gran artista cada vez se supera mas
Epic. Love it. 👍👍👍👌👌👌🤟🤟🤟
Nice💜
I feel possessed and exorcised at once. My very spirit has been shaken.
Really really sucks that he's such a pos to his fans and women. Lmao but this was needed
Over the top....Damn right.
FALLING IN REVERSE nunca me decepciona♥️🇧🇷
Congratulations!   Your angsty emo kid has evolved into Severus Snape.
disturbeds sound of silence was epic this is one bar above that. i got fucking chills and i dont get that alot from a song.
FUCKING AWESOME DAMN!!!! XD #EMOKID #GOTHIC
Amazing song
Okay is it just me or does Ronnie look really bad like I feel bad for even saying this cuz I love the fuck out of him but what did he get some plastic surgery like no..
WHOA
HOLY SHIT AHEHGWHAHAGAGEGEGEVA
Holy shit 😍
Ah Shit , Here We Go Again , Though I've Been Through The Emo Phase
Are you Lancelot?
This fu**ed my world up 😂😂😂
👍🏻
Beautiful 😭😭😭💙💙💙
*with orchestral background* "HIDE YOUR DAUGHTERS"
Holy hell I hope we get an album of this......
Ronnie just get to acting already boyyyy. Or be a director or something! There seems to be more than just musical talent in you
Ronnie's voice on this song is just amazing i like it but the old ones is just amazing and also lively and funny.
Lourde ta zic mon pote
Wait- I actually love this so much
Low-key Loki
Cadê os br que tem bom gosto?

uuu, como en "entrevista con el vampiro"
For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death. (2 Corinthians 7:10) The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. (2 Peter 3:9) And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent: (Acts 17:30)
I wore my sister's pants before male skinny jeans were a thing baby. I think I know what I'm talking about.
This why Ronnie is levels ahead of the game, truly steps above greatness
Потрясающе. Настолько переданы эмоции.
I'm so sad they didn't perform this version in their live stream shows! I was so looking forward to hearing it live! :( It's literally my favourite song of 2021!!
Such an amazing song remake, As well as an absolutely beautiful video. Ronnie is just a genius and I love that they dedicated this to Derek, Rest well Derek.
I hope he gets an award or something for this. Or at least the RR award. Ronnie you should create your own award! 😂😂😂
this could be cecilion and carmilla story in music video.
i could listen to this on repeat forever... blown away
Well, I'm not a vampire, but I feel like one Sometimes I sleep all day 'cause I hate the sunlight My hands are always shaking Body's always aching, and the dark is when I feed Well, I can lure any woman that I want to in my bed with me  And whiskey seems to be my holy water And mothers, better lock your doors and hide your daughters  'Cause I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold? For goodness sake, where is my self-control? If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all hope  Well, I'm not a zombie But I feel like one today Self-induced comatose, chemical daze   My head is always spinning from this dizzy blurry vision and my stomach has had enough I feel like a lady that is pregnant with a baby 'cause I'm always throwing up  And hi, my name is Ronnie, I'm an addict And daddy should've never raised me on Black Sabbath  I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold? For goodness sake, where is my self-control? If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all hope  When will you mortals believe? (He's not a vampire) I just want the world to bleed (He's not a vampire) Lust at the sight of your blood (He's not a vampire) I swear to God, I am not a... (He is not a) (He is not a)   So God bless all of you now 'Cause I'm going straight to Hell (Straight to Hell) And I'm taking you down with me Because you know damn well  So I sharpen my teeth 'cause I love the way it feels When I sink into your skin and draw the only thing that's real You don't believe me, should I write it in blood? You better drive that fucking stake right down my heart and try to run Motherfucker, I'm a vampire!  And I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold? For goodness sake, where is my self-control? If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all Heart has fucking lost all Heart has lost all hope (He's lost all hope) (He's lost all hope) (He's lost all hope) All hope, my heart has lost all hope
Incredible
Pure fahking magic, I love Ronnie... You can tell how much he loves music when he makes these masterpieces 👌🏼
amazing....wow.. <3
Didn’t know that was Paige💞 She looks different without her makeup.
Fuck I'm sad, Memories..
THIS SONG IS EVERITYING I NEED IN MY LIFE
I dont know why Im sad, is it because I loved it when I was 17 and now I still love it at 27made me feel sad about how fast the years passed maybe. Damnit Ronnie
This version has so much more emotion.... fits the lyrics better absolutely phenomenal
God of skeptical dystopy
It's not a phase, it's a lifestyle
This. This is why Im still here.
This is SO GOOD!!!!
I wanted to love this, but just can't get into it like I could with The Drug In Me Is Reimagined".  I think it's because the original lyrics are too comical to match with a serious tone like this.  I do like their stuff in this style though and hope they continue to make more songs like this with piano and orchestra.
danmmm i listen to this beutifull song over and over just love how this guys voice changes from hige to low
I am dreaming about Beer evening-night with Ronnie - just to understand what`s in mind of this great person. Would like to hear a real story of life and what`s beyond every line in song. There is no better experience and blessing than to spent OPEN MIND chat from evening - till morning with person who really have a lot to say. Ronnie - thank you for you ART and sharing your emotions with US. from Latvia with respect and honor.
“If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all hope!” Me when I can’t afford a swimsuit on Xtreme Beach Volleyball 🏳️‍🌈
Ronnie is a Lyrical Genius! Love his music.
Heres my take on this song 🎧   Well I know people want to help me. But I want no one.  True thing.  Everyday I neglect my life. List is always building. Why.  My nerves are so wrecked that I look like I got Parkinson’s.  What is exactly wrong with me. I know that these pills that restrain me will never really free me. And this seems to be.  For me my call to some sort of action.  And so Thankful for a sense of reason.  But do I repeat wrongs. I do.   Otherwise I’d be insane. This is a thing I know. For sure.  I was never taught restraint. Learned it all on my own.  I was taught through pain.  Little late yes I know.  This road may seem the hardest. But the hardest are forged in the best molds.   Well I don’t intend to offend people.  But some I do. always. Seems everyday.  Why can’t I just get along. With anyone. Literal thing.  I can’t be responsible for this primal instinct to, fulfill myself with all these drugs. I’m thinking just maybe if I do a bit more it’ll finally be enough to overflow my fucken cup.   I may be berserk. But I’m holding the leash.   It’s no secret I may have had one to many back hands man.   We’re all insane. Repeating the past. Indefinitely.   Not one of us knows our own fate. This much I fucken know.   I’m growing so ever sick of the life’s repetitiveness in my soul.   If you hold something dear. You better Keep it near. Because life’s got it’s own plans.  3:24  ........  3:52 What hell happened to all of us bro.  We’re all straight fucked in the head.  We’re all blazing through life. Oblivious as all hell.  The fact is we all got no damn clue.   4:36 You ask why must this be. I reply it’s all the pain.  Once it finds Its way into your soul. you know that shit is actually real.  It’s no relief to me. To say that it’s in the past. When all the things in past seem so ever present In the moment right now. Motherfucker. Self awareness.   We’re all insane. Condemned to walk this earth. Life makes the choices. Your just along for the ride. Buckel up little bitch. Shits about to get real rough. We’re all so fucken lost that google can’t even help us. We’re all fucken off the. We’re all off the map.   Straight up fucken lost bro. (Choir)  We’re all alone.  That’s the biggest lie. You can’t let yourself believe.   S4V3R4G3 🤌🏼
Ronnie: learns piano and decides to turn his older songs into freaking cinematic beauties.  What an absolute lad
Ronnie Radke VS Jake Paul. MAKE THIS A THING!
This is the 2021 my chemical romance ...
Fucking epic dude. Genius yet again.
i fucking love this. thank you <3
Better than the original version
Damn epitaphs really went down hill since i last bought a comp. lol Punk ska hardcore but this sux
I had never heard of Falling in Reverse, nor had I ever heard of Ronnie Radke. I stumbled across this, and to say it blew my mind is the understatement of the century. I have never gotten such a visceral reaction to a song before. The line “Hi my name is Ronnie, I’m an addict.” Gave me chills as I too am an addict. June 1st was one year sober. I felt every second of this song.
holy wow
🥺❤️
intense
Paige :3
Que hino meus amigos 💕
I'm honestly interested why someone would give this a thumbs down. Please comment in here your reason why.
He needs to be on Broadway. This is award winning. The transition of delivery of the lyrics to show the dark side of the song is just so beautiful. I cried. The ability to just give all emotion and on top of that act out the emotion. It’s just perfection. This is just hands down one of the best productions of a song and video. This is up there with The ghost of you MCR song and video. Just perfect
🤘🖤🖤🖤🖤🤘
Ronnie Radke is on fire
Ig de la minita
Какой шикарный голос!) WOW
best Falling In Reverse's music video and best vampire short film, Ronnie Radke is amazing singer and rapper 1. Popular Monster 2. I'm Not A Vampire (Revamped) 3. Drugs 4. Losing My Life 5. Losing My Mind
Holy SHi- this is amazing! I love the original all those years ago and definitely appreciate this version; Ronnie is a very talented man this video is brilliant!
Some of us are getting tired of Ronnie thinking he can change up the old songs, this song isn't meant to be a in your feels song. The lyrics don't even fit to it. Snap out of it, yes the piano is pretty but these songs aren't meant for these. If you're trying to get into classical music stop singing over it.
Why only 1080p? These videos will not age well.
THIS SHIT WAS BUSSIN
Okay I love this song but the part where he's screaming the lyrics at the end remind me of Onion boy screaming
*SIGH* swoon
Hi my name is Ronnie, i'm a GOD
The chills when he sings "Hi my name is Ronnie I'm an addict"...It was haunting. Anyone that deals with addiction, whether personally or has a loved one suffering Had to feel that..
Chills. Keep this going Ronnie. This rock opera you got going on is fucking rad. \m/
I imagine a Tim Burton movie based on this, that would be so good!!!
Ronnie where's your tattoos? 🤭 Anyone noticed?
Superb!
Love it it was amazing
This piece of art does hit me too much hard... Way too much... I'm a 42 mum, and I have always felt myself like I'm a monster, a freak and to punish myself for being born, I do cut myself... Because I've been raped in my youth, beaten up by my parents, bullied, I've become addicted to my cutters, to relieve the pain out, when you say Ronnie that you sharpen your teeth cause you like the way it feels, actually it is the same when I do it with my cutters and when I write my pain with blood, it shuts down a little bit all my emotions... In my youths, Chester Bennington has been a real true companion to my depressions and I have always related to his lyrics and his life, now there's Chester AND you Ronnie, cause I do feel what you say and even if I'm not on my two feet, know that you are heard and understood... Thank you so very much for your songs and for being who you are... God bless you... Much love from a new fan from France... 🤲🖤🤲🖤🤲🖤🤲🖤🤲
Damn that was good!
He needs to make a live action nightmare before christmas
Woooh the ending. Just.... Wow. I love it
Ronnie early songs...not going to lie I wasnt a fan of them because they sounded too poppy for me. The latest stuff though? It seriously changed my opinion on him. It demonstrates his singing capability and musical capability and that's where I truly became intrigued unlike his again early stuff.
Oh how 10 years can change a man..... Rest easy derek🙏🙏🙏
So Radke and his crew should obviously make a musical.  I just watched forgetting sarah marshall and this gave me a ton of Peter's dracula musical vibes, but like a dark, more ominous Neil Young rather than Diamond.
If he does an album in this style, he can go anywhere with music. Forget about the rapping Ronnie this is where your talent really shines!!!
I just found this randomly... I guess, they have a new fan
This is a fucking masterpiece
wowowowowowowwww......
Класс!!!
You can tell he had no fucking idea what to with some of the cringy mid point lyrics but other then that this shit was pretty good
cradle of filth style
DEANNMM I love this shit is better thant the drugs !!!!!!!!!!
Ugh being a emo black kid in The south and feeling so misunderstood.... I’m so grateful I always stayed true to myself.
Just sitting here wishing this man would ever try to lure me into his bed😅😅 watch me laugh bitch.
This is so much better than the original version
Ronnie's Bride wakes from an undetermined slumber.  She finds the mansion empty and dusty.  She recalls how Ronnie used to play piano for her and she was blind to who he really was.  Living like a zombie while he murdered innocents. Not seeing the darkness within him while under his influence.  The rumor's surrounding him and his continued coldness to her force her to finally leave. He does not stop her, but mourns losing her after she his gone.  After a period she returns to him to find him feeding. Ronnie realizes that those he loves will be dragged to addiction with him or worse - death.  The Bride too has come her own realization, that he truly is a vampire and this drives her to suicide. Her innocence is lost. Ronnie using his powers saves and turns her. He has turned her to addiction.   The townsfolk finally arrive to seek vengeance for his evil. Ronnie understands the damage he has done and to ensure his bride is not found does not fight back.  Ronnie has lost all hope and is destroyed.  The Bride realizing he is gone and what she has become, has also lost her hope and allows the sun to destroy her as well.
HOW DID.I NOT KNOW THIS EXISTED
holy shit. This is MUCH different from what I remember O___O
god damn son. wtf is this?
Interview with the Vampire anyone??? Is this not one of Lestat's music videos? Is this not Louis lamenting his vampirism and writhing in his self loathing?
Dope
AYE HE PUT PAIGE IN THIS THATS COOL
Best carrieer's phase! Cheers!
Ok. Is it just me or does Ronnie kinda look like Michael jackson here? I’m a big fan of both
How dare you
Its masterpiece omg, Ronnie's clear vocal has become more else cool!
Bien darks!! 🔥✨😝
when Ronnie does screamo, i always get chills! he killed it
wow. I always (negatively and reluctantly viewed myself) as a metal elitist but.. that was art.. Amazing art!
YESSS beautiful 🖤
This is a masterpiece....and nothing more or less....I´m outta here
Is it just me or does the lighting in the clouds look like a face throughout the whole video? Maybe suppose to be Derek? 2:37 is a good glimpse
there was a lot of screaming and honestly i don’t know what the fuck I just saw and heard, But I am amazed at how much I like it
this video had my daughter crying today, TWICE! I have never seen her that emotional affected by a video clip before. I then cried with her. I love this version so incredibly much! (found out about FIR first yesterday!)
i still don´t get why this song has only 4M views, this is simply a masterpiece <3
That just made my fucking year 🥲❤️
Did Evanescence have a baby with MCR and get produced by Andrew Lloyd Weber??  What is this masterpiece I am listening to ?
FUCK I HATE PEOPLE!.. MANKIND SHOULD BE TAKE FRIENDSHIP WITH THE DARKNESS.. CAUSE AT THE END.. MANKIND WILL LIFE BEHIND THE SHADOW!.. :)
meu deus 2021 e aparentemente eu vou voltar a ser emo por causa de ronnie radke
Those vocals on point!
Ok, I was't ready for this masterpiece
I can listen to this on repeat 🔂
This is an amazing orchestra also r.i.p. Derek original guitarist for fir
Did he just mixed opera and rock in the same song, because is great
He should play Morbius. Step aside Jared Leto, Ronnie has you beat.
funnily enough ( not really), i got in a bad car accident last week while listening to this song, exactly at 01:53 and the music started blasting while the airbags hit my face and smoke coming out of the car. Pretty dramatic but damn this song fit that situation too perfectly lol
Now I want a metal, gothic romance stage musical.
🥰 gives me shivers just listening to falleninreverse's  music
the cinematography it's so good reminds me of tim burton I can't get over it
So Good.
This is like the counter story to UP.  When you make a more convincing love story in 6 minutes than an entire 2 hour movie.  I think I'll call it DOWN.
This song is so so good, i really really hope Ronnie keeps doing "fresh takes/revamps" like this on older songs!
Are we safe in comments
I have no idea what I'm supposed to do with that. How can one person feel sooo much?  🤯
Why good? Because they're talented. That's all i have to say
he's so pretty what the heck
I just started watching the vampire diaries 😂😂😂 I'm on season 4
These guys have been consistently killing it lately. They’re so diverse now and so talented I’m excited to see more from them!☺️
Only 4kk views its a criminal against humanity
Okay i'm voting for a version of popular monster or raised by the wolves like this one. I just love thoses remix like this one or the drug in me is you one
This was my favorite song. And now its even better. HOLY FUCK GUYS
i want hard guitars(bass drums , like "The Drug In Me Is Reimagined"
Is that Laurence Fishburne in the middle of the choir? I mean I know BMTH had Forest Whitaker in one of their songs.
Soooo.... what’s the Easter egg in this one... which song is next 😈
This is so awesome. Keep it up.
" V " DMC 5 :)))) ♥
Wow...
Que produção incrível ♥️
Listened to this song 24/7 in middle and high school and now this!!! This is an eargasm!!
fun fact: the dude named ronnie is the lead singer of falling in reverse, and thats his real name, i decied to give you this fact because i wanted to lol
what a fucking voice !!
4:20 gives me chills every time...
3:51 the ' You' reminds me some Howard Jones and it's freaking me out
Really wanted to see Vamp Ronnie tear apart the villagers.
it's not a phase mom  see told you its not a phase!
Me: hmm I wonder if Ronnie's able to amaze us even more in 2021🤔 Ronnie: Hold my throat.
Wow
It's sad that she died, especially after he turned her into a vampire to keep her alive.
Best song I have ever heard. This can not be played loud enough
Holy fucking shit! This is EPIC!! I was first like ok those 6 minutes will be just a video but it's a 6 minutes song and it's fuckig good song! I thing this is the best song and video they could dedicate to the memory of Derek 🖤
WOW
Ronnie takes awhile to make a new song, but everytime he does it's a new hit!!
This was legit better than 95% of the movies I’ve ever seen
I loved the revamped version of the song. I wasn’t in love with the original but this one is epic, beautiful. I am in loveee
This made me cry. His voice and the lyrics just give me goosebumps. Pure talent. He needs an award for this!
Dayummmmmmm, the drama 😮
ive lost count how many times i have woke up singing this song and how many times i have watched it and all the reactions and just watching him and all his magic he can do would love to know the storys that are hinted at like the bath tub that seemed it brought alot of pain out in him hearing how he sung that part after 10/10 on giving me bumps and all the power of the song can carry so many ways thank you so such for this song
Every time I think I've put my emo phase behind me...
One word.   AMAZING!!!!!!!!
am I  the only person getting castelvania vibes ?
2010: us as emo kids 2021: us as goth kids
from alestorm to halestorm
I live for all of this right here. Always emo at heart istg I see this as art, not to mention the dedication like hell yeah. 💙
The way Paige’s hair flips on tempo around 2:56  👌🏼
Looking a bit like Davey Havok.
If they remake Queen of the Damned, I swear to God this better be on the soundtrack
Yall once an emo always an emo 😭✋
When I hear the very start I can help but think of "shut up, just shut up, shut up" black eyed peas
This is what y’all came for from tiktok 2:40

1.5x velocity: welcome 2011 ♥️
Original: hard bop! Re'vamped'(I'm lame): but dang revamp is pulling on my heartstrings and pulls the emotion put of the lyrics so much more and love the vampire cult twist!
🥲 I'm not crying, you're crying 😭
5:40 🤯
Puta que pariu o que foi isso  To toda arrepiada
HOLY SHIT THIS VOCAL!!!! IT'S TOTALY DIFFERENT!
Ok go off Professor Snape
Hey buddy loving the vampire gimmick! Keep up the awesome, unique, creative, talent-soaked art you have conjured for us to marvel at! I liked AFI too!
Honestly not a big fan of FIR, but the editing is like OUT OF THIS WORLD
its even deeper then a vamp tbh   tell athina ill love her soul while we enter the depths of feeling while we cant yet ,,,!!?????????!!
dead inside
EPIC
wish i had to see this reimagined of  Not Good Enough For Truth In Cliche it will be so good !
Dark with the monster in me will not  rest  until  I lose control but  the  light  shines through and I see the  the f#$king shit that will  be stacked up like  mountains
just wow
If Ronnie played Edward I might watch twilight. But then. Ronnie would also have to play Jacob because of Popular Monster. And then we'd be split into team Ronnie and Team Ronnie. I could live with that.
HOW COME I HADN'T YET SEEN THIS ONE!? OMG!!!
I wouldn't against it if he wrote a musical and made a full length movie. That would be my favorite thing ever.
I love these remakes of the older songs, they're such good songs and the videos are so intense and beautiful. Pure genius!
Falling in Reverse.....is rising?! :)  I LOVE it! Great Music!
Getting hardcore AFI vibes from this. <3
Ronnie has a side that he show that he is not all just rock and he proves that he can sing. All I have to say is that Ronnie keep it up man.
Why ruin such a great song.....
It was awesome!! i've already heard all of falling in reverse and i need moooore!!! could you please recommend something like this goodness voice??
Love this remake thing.
The screaming at the end really saved this song for me, I was blown away and had no clue he could scream like that 🔥
I remember the voice of fall out boy - centuries
Emo on steroids.  Excellent reworking.
I can't stop watching this.
Take meh now 🧎
I also feel like a lady with a baby cuz I'm always throwing up.
I wish they would revamp every song for an album. It's so much darker.
4 milli in 2 months LFG
Anyone else notice the similarities between the island in here & the live stream 🤔
Yo who was going to tell me he posted this two months ago!!!! Like what!! I had no idea and I have been a fan sense 2015. Like wHaT!?
Gothic Cool, Morbid Melodious Odious Immortality!!!
Que guapo es Ronnie
Absolutely Gorgeous ❣️
So powerfull, omg *-*
This is fucking cool. Damn!!!
Omg🙏 such a true artist!
Can anyone recommend me similar songs to this one?
I can listen to this everyday. The piano part the beginning gets me everytime. This is one of those times the remix is way better then the original. Keep it up Ronnie. Love the story you tell
Wow
Eh, Drug reimagined was much, much better tbh
shoulda released this first
Damn, that was epic
This is refreshing.   It's like .. Slipknots The Vermillion Pt. 2 for a new generation in a way
Wow
3:28 ronnie definitely loves call of duty. and he might actually be a zombie.
i wanna hear this Melodic badasserie on Chemical Prisoner!!! keep up this amazingness Ronnie !!!
"Sometimes I sleep all day"... Me : Maybe has depression too....
Таою мать, что ты творишь? Это же гениально и просто великолепно!!!
Ooou my carefree youth <3
HOLY SHIT THIS IS AMAZING
A beautiful masterpiece
This is SO AWESOME!!!! I am stunned
Can someone tell me why people hate on falling in reverse so much?? This is a fucking masterpiece and this version has been my fav song since it came out.
Lyrics  Well, I'm not a vampire, but I feel like one Sometimes I sleep all day 'cause I hate the sunlight My hands are always shaking Body's always aching, and the dark is when I feed Well, I can lure any woman that I want to in my bed with me  And whiskey seems to be my holy water And mothers, better lock your doors and hide your daughters  'Cause I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold? For goodness sake, where is my self-control? If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all hope  Well, I'm not a zombie But I feel like one today Self-induced comatose, chemical daze  My head is always spinning from this dizzy blurry vision and my stomach has had enough I feel like a lady that is pregnant with a baby 'cause I'm always throwing up  And hi, my name is Ronnie, I'm an addict And daddy should've never raised me on Black Sabbath  I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold? For goodness sake, where is my self-control? If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all hope  When will you mortals believe? (He's not a vampire) I just want the world to bleed (He's not a vampire) Lust at the sight of your blood (He's not a vampire) I swear to God, I am not a... (He is not a) (He is not a)  So God bless all of you now 'Cause I'm going straight to Hell (Straight to Hell) And I'm taking you down with me Because you know damn well  So I sharpen my teeth 'cause I love the way it feels When I sink into your skin and draw the only thing that's real You don't believe me, should I write it in blood? You better drive that fucking stake right down my heart and try to run Motherfucker, I'm a vampire!  And I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold? For goodness sake, where is my self-control? If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all Heart has fucking lost all Heart has lost all hope (He's lost all hope) (He's lost all hope) (He's lost all hope) All hope, my heart has lost all hope
¡¡¡A masterpiece!!! 😱😍👏
This is my 10th time watching this video this week! I'm addicted 😍
Ronnie is a genius
He got his choir
the best I've heard in a long time. simply everything united. Ronnie has such a great talent.
This video is better than any movie of 2020.
Absolutely brilliant, need to stick with this dark intense style. My daughter has taken a liking to this and she isnt quite 5 years old yet.
OMG suena demasiado ÉPICO me encantaaaaaaa
do you have any gwapes!?
real one remember the original .
why does this have any dislikes
This is a godamn movie of Castlevania haha
This is Buck Wild & I am Here for every damn second of it
He look so much like Gus G
damn ronnie is still the best
Loki really be singing his heart out in this one. You go god-bro
Ronnie, hun... you got us good with this one
Holy sh*t this might be a movie
What in the Tim Burton meets Underworld brilliant masterpiece is this? Bravo to Ronnie
I don't know what to say.. I'm spechless. That's a fucking masterpiece!!!
The Hauting of hill Radke! What a focking great singer... fiou 🫀💣
wow
これ前にアップされてたやつ？ 曲、音は良かったと思う。 歌詞は分からないけど。
Gotta be a honest I prefer the first version but still this is a goddamn masterpiece!
**sighs and gets out the eyeliner** here we go again lads
Ronnie Radke is just killing it! Ronnie and Jacoby Shaddix are my favorite rock stars - I'd love to see them collaborate
Ronnie, you bloody legend mate!
Um guys. Is this really Ronnie? This guy? Really Ronnie Radke?
Incredible
Beautiful
❤️
LIT 🔥🔥🔥
waiting for a remix and a remaster to go with revamped and reimagined
Dude OMFGG!!!!! I love the originally version and most of the time I stick the ogs cause the newer versions tend to suck but this is so fooking awesome I can't believe I just watched!!!!! it's soooooo cool what they did with it!
I’ve listened to this on repeat for the past 2 days
EU TÔ 100% DEVASTADA. PARABÉNS AOS ENVOLVIDOS, PERFEITOH
Man, did my soul need this!
does that beginning scene remind everyone of helena or am i just an emo rat
They got us in the first half, not going to lie
As someone who grew up blasting(because I just had to be the edgy kid with loud headphones)the original this was terrifying in the blast way possible....
3:23 this is just... Gold
*When he loses edge lord status and gains full goth status*
This is so beautiful ughhhhhhh
I absolutely LOVE this rendition and video. Phenomenal, very well done.
3:50
oh gosh, this is so beautiful
Holy shit; me and my friend was not expecting this today! This is amazing! I remember the original song and when we played this in the car today I bout cried but didn't cause I was too stunned and screaming with shock and excitement with my friend!
Just imagine Ronnie in a underworld musical. Yesssss pleaseee!
Reliveing the song to when it first came out. STILL AMAZED by you guys♡♡♡
🎶🎶🎶🎶🙏🏻
Men el inicio me dio una nostalgia recuerdos todo no había escuchado esto, había dejado de lado a la banda por el año 2018.  ufff me hizo sentir de todo xd
fucking amazing just wow plz make an entire album just like that !!!
Ronnie you are a fucking genius
Yes! I'm so into piano rock rn. Love. Love love yall
Wow, Aro was dramatical as hell when he was young.
Wow he's soooo good he can deliver the same song with the same lyrics.....in a whole new way. Just wow amazing
Esto es arte 🖤
You got the double R that stands for rappin and rockin but we don't see you rappin for a long time :(
Seriously the prettiest music video I’ve ever seen. Ronnie deserves an award🥺
Wow! I feel like I just watched a movie
Ronnie deserves a Grammy after this! This is freaking incredible!!! Goosebumps!
These new versions are insane. I hope they do more of these, so fricking emotional 🔥 breath taking.
The cliff instantly reminded me od "Dark Shadows" by Tim Burton lol
Diosssss amo este temaaaaa es normal que lo haya escuchado hoy 1000 veces? ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
aint it funny that he has a cross earring
Umm. Is it weird that I feel a little somethin somethin down there when he hits that one “hope” note (heart has lost all “hope”) toward the end? 😳 lol 😂
What the fuck did i just listen to xD xD the fast version is better this is just weird i don't know xD
It's crazy when you look at the original versions of these songs it just shows you how much Ronnie has grown as a person and how the way he sees things has changed
I would so love to cover this song. This is my musical vibe right there. Go big or go the hell home. I pour my heart into what I sing so they feel that in the deepest parts of them.
I'm getting Dark Shadows vibes from this
🇧🇷
he is so handsome in the clip. Amazing ❤
🥺😍🖤
Little Rascals Revamped lol
Did he just mix hard rock with opera? And make it sound really fucking good? That’s it he is greatest of all time👏👏👏👏👏
RIP Derek 🤘
This is so amazing!!!!! This is a beautiful tribute to Derek guys! 🙏❤️
Krl que produção
This is SO cheesy omfg from the heavily over-the-top lady with enhanced  everything to the bad visuals, the frigging monk choir, and the facepalm burning face at the end... - so cheesy this could be a video for some Russian 40+ pop star. Sad, because his vocals are pretty good, reminiscent even of Fallout Boy at the start.
Did he cover his tattoos or? I’m dumb lol don’t judge me
The only remakes in history that are fucking amazing!! love everything that FIR does
This is really amazing
Anybody else feel like they just watched an incredible Broadway musical performance?
Vampire Chronicles looks a little different here?
This is amazing :OOO
Absolutely stunning. Really out done yourselves on this one. Bravo!
This gave me chills. ❤
Hi, my name is Sab. And i'm an addict. (To this song) :)
Now I have a hobby to watch the reaction to this song
Shivers I got shivers
Wow... This is Incredible! Job very well done you guys!!! 🤍🌹
WHY DIDNT I KNOW ABOUT THIS
zacatek: 0:42 teeth 4:35 - 5:46 f zkracene: 5:02 - 5:46 zombie 2:11 - 2:54
I honestly adore this version, as soon as I saw revamped I was like ayyyy I saw what you did there
I goddamn love this version of the song.
Going into this I was not expecting much considering how the drug in me is reimagined was just sad. But I fucking love this.
Bro I think I cry or shake it off every time I play this
"I want to do Cradle of Filth but make it Meatloaf."
ITS A FCKNG MASTERPIECE
Браво! Оригинальная версия была хороша, но это уже искусство 👏👏👏
Lost opportunity to name this song "I'm Not A Revampire"
Just... WOW. <3
Ronnie without tattoos seems so weird to me...
And here goes another one! Love it
Love the direction youre taking. So much more emotion.  LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!  Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
What an absolutely magnificent song! I just cant stop listening and watching the video. Utterly amazing. What a voice he has developed! And the video is a masterpice! kudos!
this is a masterpiece!
continues to amaze me every time. absolutely love all your work falling in reverse
They made a whole movie compacted into 6.17 wtf!!!
WHEN I TELL THIS WAS SO GOOD THAT I CRYED YOU BEST BELIEVE I DID!!!!
One word Masterpiece!!!
royal casanova
When FIR meet Meat Loaf
I think we can all agree he is a great fucking singer
I feel this song its crazy....
Come on y'all tell me ronnie singing like this would sound even more amazing with early 2000s Amy Lee
Everyone always talks about ronnie, but no one notices the "in loving memory of Derek Jones"
Legit sounds like Mr Crowley to start off I could literally hear ozzy say "Mr. Crowley the second it stopped
The “‘my head is always spinning from this dizzy, blurry vision” part tho 😱
I.. I didn’t know the original could be topped- 😩🤌✨
This song went from quick jabs from a featherweight to some solid body blows from a heavyweight. The lyrics finally have the tempo to make a solid impact. Awesome.
It's great to hear more of these type of vocals from him. Ronnie has such a powerful/beautiful voice. Would love to hear the revamped songs live!
This is a masterpiece
I've been a fan of ronnie, since he wasnt famous... I can tell you kids of 2000s this is what a musician and artist looks like.
super ;) supremas estas versiones
Only on the 50th listen did I realize that is *PAIGE FROM WWE!!* I feel dumb 😂 😂
Magnífico
When is the musical coming out?
Amazing, shivering, masterpiece !
After the previous clips, where Ronnie is waving his arms, it is strange to watch him just stand with his hands down XD. 0:43
este tipo es una obra de arte
Watched this the first time thinking “damn - the lady is beautiful!!” Watched a second time - “wait, why does she looks so familiar. Still gorgeous but I’ve seen her face somewhere” Watched a third time - “Holy crap that’s Paige!! No wonder she’s so stunning!”
I hope this is a turning point for Ronnie
This is art pure🖤
Simply put??....... Fucking amazing! a musical masterpiece!

Why is a new melodramatic dramatic Victorian vampire power power ballad EXACTLY what I needed right now
I’m so happy I stumbled across this
The theatrics kinda remind me of a little piece of heaven from avenged sevenfold
Unofficial Theme Song of Resident Evil Village
It started with a Popular Monster cover a few days before. I checked out the original and listened to it zillion times, finding it way better and just perfect, now I am here, listening to this over and over and wonder if it's the best music video I ever saw according to my taste. I am in love :D If I wanted to kill myself but wasn't in a big hurry, I would live a bit more just to listen to it more. This song makes my life so much better now and yep, my life isn't good now but my inner hedonist is very happy and thankful now.
This is pure genius and his voice his amazing - such a talented man x
Вы серьезно??? Я этот клип увидел неделю назад, меня уже прёт!!!

Michael Jackson from Ghosts said hi
Nicholas Staker is gay
Lyrics : Well, I'm not a vampire But I feel like one Sometimes I sleep all day Because I hate the sunlight My hands are always shaking Body's always aching And the dark is when I feed  Well, I can lure any woman that I want to in my bed With me And whiskey seems to be my holy water Mothers better lock your doors And hide your daughters  I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold?

For goodness' sakes Where is my self control?

I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness' sakes Where is my self control?

LOVELYYY❤

DADDY SHOULD'VE NEVER RAISED ME ON BLACK SABBATH
Awesome
La verdad que Ronnie es de mis artistas favoritos, me encanta su musica. lo descrubri con el album "the drug in me is you" y investigue sobre el, me encanta. Saludos desde Argentina
Does anyone else get a mr. Crowley vibe in the opening
i hadnt listened to fir since their first album or two. then i saw this and i was like holyyyyy shit. ronnie has gotten so much better over the years. this is really impressive. i got chills
Barnabas collins tá diferente
Paige and Ronnie.. 😍🇧🇷❤🤘🏻
Absolute legend as always 👏👏👏
What did you say about being an emo in the 2000s? Yea, talent.
Lol, he reminds me of Aro from Twilight
"I'm Not A Vampire" Thats what Vampire would say
not gonna lie...I expected a FUS RO DA! this shit is straight up skyrim. Love you guys tho keep doing you.
Anyone else get chills
This is so powerful OMGGG
Por qué está canción esta poco reconocida si es tan buenaaa? LA AMOOOO
can someone tell me the reason of the pause from the music at 0:06 ?
i cant get over this and i dont think i ever will
How do I give this video a 1000 likes?! This is  a real masterpiece, out of this world
If all of you are confuse about why there is "reimagined" and "revamped" songs just spell F A L L I N G   I N  R E V E R S E...
Ugh the ending!!!!!! His voice is like butter.....   The ending gives off a strong sense of Phantom of the Opera mixed with Dr. Frankenstein
Am I actually crying ?
O M G! This is pure art! This song is a masterpiece 😨❤️
What's up with all the haters? This is one ov the most amazing video productions anyone has seen in a very long time. In a time ov disposable tracks this is truly special.
he's literally white
Perfectly incised epic! A wonderful novel in the version of an absolutely successful video. CHAPEAU! I love it ....
Epic,a little big masterpiece for real in visual, musical and lyrical set.But the wall clock above the arch down stairs is unwatchable in that context :-)
This actress would make a really good Yennefer, appearance wise.
If you cant relate to this you need to stop your denial
If people aren’t making the connection between addiction and a vampires need for blood, do that. ... like most addicts or in this case his vampire side she knows is real but chooses to ignore it until it consumes her too... we addicts hurt everyone we come in contact with until with “get self control”... he wants to hide this from the ones he loves, but addiction is a fucking bitch. Ronnie you have gained my upmost respect and your songwriting has depth and layers like crazy. Keep this up.
I found out about Ronnie and FIR because of the reimagined version but goddamn I'm an addict now Ronnie you are a blessed genius All love from Syria bro ❤️❤️
This feels like an intro to the original and I’m living for it
Like, this has so much more soul than the original...
the budget though oh my
God damn. Amazing master piece.
Как фильм посмотрел :-)
Quiero darle likes más veces, se lo merece
Ronnie! I bought the tix and merch on my sons computer.  So its under his utuve n Gmail. Wtf how do I switch it? O was away for a bit over a month at a CSS to get my drinking over w. And recently bought the stuff. It sais 2 to 4 weeks but use the Gmail. I wanna use mine lol. Help
OMG I can’t watch and listen to this for too many times, otherwise other music will become shit to me,  Wait, they already are.
oh Snape i didn't know you are a vampire
about FallingInReverse and now always in loving memory of Derek Jones
omg
m in love
He still got it 😎
Paige is beautiful
After being a Popular Monster (Werewolf) Ronnie is back as a Vampire, this dude is so fucking awesome, all his new video or song are just  a Masterpiece. Love it and his vocal is just so good. i Pray for all people who don't know Falling in Reverse lol
like your energy in this music...
GOOSEBUMPS 😭when the musical comedy?
Вот блин, уже неделя на повторе, Ронни гений)
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
He can be my vampire any day ❤️🖤
this is absolutely phenomenal...my lil emo heart loves this masterpiece
I love this. It's a beautiful masterpiece. It's such a moving song.
2021 is going to be good ♥ Such a master piece! :o
Now all Ronnie needs to do is remake more songs and play The Mummy, The Invisible Man, The Phantom of the Opera, and The Creature from the Black Lagoon.
This is a fucking masterpiece...I feel like it belongs to my sufferance...
Лажа, унылее не  придумаешь.
The people that put thumbs down do not know music at all
WOW JUST WOW
This Dracula reboot looks fucking insane. Cant wait.
Damn damn damn !!!!! Yeeessss!!
Piękna piosenka głos eres espectacular
Почему я только сейчас открыл для себя эту ох.......ю группу??!
One of the best videos produced/directed in the last 10 years!!! Well done!! Not really my type of music but the vocals and composition was on point with the story being told! Superb artistic vision!!!
All I can say BOW DOWN ! HE IS A GENIUS!
I would Pay good money to see a Falling In Reverse Broadway show
It's a great song and video with no words. It's great to see you again now... wow..😭😭
Is he going to reimagine all the The Drug in Me is You? That would be awesome.
Masterpiece as always,you guys fuckin lit,my fave band ever!
It has been absolutely amazing to watch Ronnie and the band mature so much
I cried like a baby watching this masterpiece wow
My new favorite song
When you have the talent like this man you can do whatever the fuck you want.
please stop screwing up your old songs Ronnie, I beg you 😭
WOW
GLORIOUS🔥🔥🔥🔥
wow. no way he just oozes dramatic influence, bravo Ronnie, bravo!
I just... holy... that was amazing!
Jfc a masterpiece
Devamped*
FUCKING EPIC!!!!
Como olvidar cuando Loki era vampiro xD
Boa hammer geiles Video. Musik wie immer TOP
EPIC!!
3:50 - 4:23 is THE best part and you cant change my mind      oh and 4:50 too
better than the original. try and change my mind, you won't
dramatic bitch. I love him.
ok but i love his hair.
Ronnie, I'm just saying one thing ... YOU ARE FUCKING GOD, THIS IS A MASTERPIECE
I would pay to see this on the big screen. Bravo
This is just amazing as it can be i got chills all over every time i hear and see this.  One question who is the woman in the video?
Caralho que Clip foda .... <3
"Emo and goth are the same thing" bruh
Just love all these revamped songs, pure gold, amazing musical talent
Another great performance by Professor Snape
Zack Snyder's "I'm not a vampire"
Never fails to blow me away
Shit. Even before falling in reverse i thought his music was fucking dope. But it doesn't even compare to this level, amazing to see a artist evolve so much. Ronnie's versatility as a artist is truly beyond fucking human.  Also, mad cred to the band for being dope asf, sadly people usually leave them out in their comments.
Épico.
Now we need Raised by the wolves reimagined
At this point being emo is a flex
R.I.P Derek Jones, trying really hard not to follow the same path here...
This is so fucking good I cant get enough of it falling in reverse is so fucking amazing still cant believe Derek is gone though he will be missed
This has to be one of the best songs I’ve heard in a longtime, liked the original  but this just blew me away, AWSOME
Actually, on of the best singer now at all,  not the only at “heavy”music!  fantastic technical clear voice, insane extreme parts. If anyone asks me show my favorite music, that 100% it will be one of the Ronnie songs last 2 years. Fantastic #falling in reverse
OG song > Revamp
0:54 Professor Snape?!
I facking love this
Ronnie you are just a genious...the way you revamp your own songs is just too amazing...please continue doing so......i loooooove it❤ You are such a versatile singer, not too many of them😉you can sing anythingggggg❤
That's gas
Before I was just a fan. But after this masterpiece, I’m a whole air conditioner.
I hope I’m not crazy for saying this but the revamped version of this and “the drug in me is you” are the superior versions
CHE SPETTACOLO RONNIE . LOVE FROM ITALY
This is one of my favorite songs from my maybe late teens/early 20’s. I felt this in my chest when I listened to it and it gave me all the right feelings. What a work of art....I felt like I just watched an entire fucking movie.
The next stage for Ronnie: Vampwolf the Musical 😂
O-MY-GOD
God damn.
The old one was better
I'm in tears. That is all.
5:40 This is the equivalent of playing a scale but stopping on the 7th note five times in a row before you let yourself hit the 8th note
Holy fuck I didn't think this song could get better!
If queen of the damned cast him as lestat 😍
CHILLS
everyone having a old classic vibe until Ronnie screaming Mother-word
It's literally just FIR and BMTH left in their scene pushing the limits.
that's exactly what a vampire would say
Ronnie is fucking legend.
Why is nobody talking about Paige? She's awesome!
we'll always remember him
nobody gonna mention paige? thats dope to see her in this
This is a fucking masterpiece, and should be recognized as such! Thank you again Mr. Radke and everyone else involved! 🙏🔥🔥🔥🔥
Blah blahblah
Wow! This is a masterpiece!!
Este es el comentario en español que buscabas, solo para reiterar que Ronnie Radke es uno de los cantantes más talentosos de este planeta.
I guess i never really thanked the trends but without them i would’ve never found this band....... It was a regular day, i was scrolling through the deepest, scariest side of the trends to see which video i could roast in the comment section........but between germany‘s next top morons (ehhhh..model) and videos like "i try to put on make up in a car while my husband is driving" i found this masterpiece and i can‘t stop listening to falling in reverse since
the 8th - shun
Magic! Knew it would happen.... but this is beyond all..... imaginings/expectations/......hopes!
remake "the westerner" in a western style >_> pls
Well, I'm not a vampire, but I feel like one Sometimes I sleep all day 'cause I hate the sunlight My hands are always shaking, body's always aching And the dark is when I feed Well, I can lure any woman that I want to in my bed with me  And whiskey seems to be my holy water And mothers, better lock your doors and hide your daughters  'Cause I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold? For goodness sakes, where is my self-control? If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all hope  Well, I'm not a zombie, but I feel like one today Self-induced comatose, chemical daze My head is always spinning from this dizzy blurry vision And my stomach has had enough I feel like a lady that is pregnant with a baby 'Cause I'm always throwing up  And hi, my name is Ronnie, I'm an addict And daddy should've never raised me on Black Sabbath  I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold? For goodness sakes, where is my self-control? If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all hope  When will you mortals believe? I just want the world to bleed Lust at the sight of your blood I swear to God, I am not a  So God bless all of you now  'Cause I'm going straight to hell And I'm taking you down with me Because you know damn well  So I sharpen my teeth 'cause I love the way it feels When I sink into your skin and draw the only thing that's real You don't believe me, should I write it in blood? You better drive that fucking stake Right down my heart and try to run Motherfucker, I'm a vampire  'Cause I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold? For goodness sakes, where is my self-control? If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all Heart has fucking lost all, heart has lost all hope  All hope, my heart has lost all hope
This was spectacular
JUST When they said Ricky had no talent!  Just watch! The video speaks!
I need a full metal opera of this. This is just so fucking well done Ronnie!!!
Emo is the new Goth. Period.
One does not simply not acknowledge his talent.. that dude is just.. wow
im not a vampire but i feel like one
If u guys are wondering who’s the girl that’s wwe superstar Paige your welcome
Just started listening to Falling in Reverse two weeks ago. Ronnie is an amazing artist. This is one of my favorite songs. I love this new version.
QUALITY SUBERB MUSIC LEGEND RESPECT 👍👌
I feel like I've just watched a Tim Burton movie. Gosh this is amazing!
What a Good things coming
Paige from WWE.
Ronnie you've done it again man. Speechless here.
He looks kinda like Severus Snape mixed with Loki
omg i love it
he looks SO FUCKIN WEIRD WITH HIS TATS COVERED UP
So not radio friendly then
I attended Whitby Drac fest, wow It is grand Opulence!
Girl's name?
Finally putting his classical singing training to use 👍
Holy fucking shot balls...... wtf just happened!!! Masterpiece!!! Dead
♥️♥️♥️
I don't like this 😭 bring the screaming back
As he's told us before, Ronnie's a fkn monster....
I was on the verge of tears, then I read “in loving memory of Derek Jones” and I lost it.
I hated it but always come back
My love for must is so big. I should become a reaction person. I'd smoke these other reactors . I don't have the loot to tho
It's really unusual how most don't get this song written and about his drug an alcohol addiction?
Ii can never get enough
omg!!! its paige(ex-wwe)
No creí que necesitaba esto😍🖤
Bitches be like: anybody gonna revamp this sick emo party music into a series of goth epics? Then not wait for an answer
I like the revamp of the drug in me more, but I don't like this revamp as much as the original. He needs to combine the styles of both the og and this to create the best version I think. His operatic vocal could work even better with electric guitar in my opinion. Of course that's just my opinion. Still a good song.
Now for there's no truth in the cliche. That would be some shit
Hi, my name is Fran. I´m an addict.  An addict to empathy. I´m feeding on empathy. Always been an empathic listener and no band/musician has EVER achieved anything similiar to what Ronnie made me feel with the "Reimagined" and "Revamped" versions. These pieces of art are haunting me still in my sleep. Credits and Kudos to all who were involved in these projects. Everything is Grammy worthy! The lyrics, the storytelling, the production, the cinematics, the nuances/layers of Ronnie´s voice...just everything.  I´ve watched so many reaction channels reacting to Ronnie or Falling in Reverse in general. Never I´ve gotten so much connected to Reactors and experience their feelings/emotions/thoughts they were going through while watching/listening.  Many times it was mentioned that Ronnie can be compared to Freddy Mercury. I don´t agree on that much but I´m daring to say that he is the new Chester Bennington.    Love goes out to Ronnie! Can´t wait for next project <3
I am sure. Definitely He is a vampire
i love this songs so much
The fallacious visitor densply fool because cough antenatally possess save a nine christopher. handsome, vulgar grey
This gave me the same chills that the original did when I was a teen hearing it for the first time.
Forgetting Sarah Marshall
2011 Version: We as emo kids. 2021 Version: We as emo adults.
Most UNDERRATED frontman, vocalist and songwriter ever. Because he's an ex-con and an asshole shouldn't detract from the talent this man possesses 💯. I'd LOVE to find any of these pop artists, rappers, etc, even remotely try to match Ronnie's vocal range. This man is an absolute genius in more ways than 1. 🤘💪💯 Keep this shit up Ronnie!!
This was beautiful.
This guy is a genius, is amazing how he can change the voice tone creating a transition from classic to metal.
duuuuuude dooope
Nobody's gonna talk about paige.. hot damn!
That's how I want to go.  Burned to death on a pole at the edge of a beautiful cliff facing an ocean.  Someone turn me into a vampire so the deed may be done.
I think Ronnie could do this with every song he has sung.
That was spiritual.
Popular Monster what I would have become to my Daughter had I , I couldve took her changed laws. My Vita Nova!!!!!  hate if i would have unleashed only it was to make sure i had no more hate! It was for others not to as well . And Werewolves and Vampires . Stories to keep people away. People believe still yet today . Switzerland!!!
This makes me cry every time! So beautiful
dude ....this is the sickest fucking thing ever
Ronnie i need a good lawyer. I have been so miss treated but this joke of a justice system
Wait a minute, is that Paige?
I could listen to this so many times and not get annoyed to it, it’s so good
If I wasn't in love with my husband like woooo! You make me swoon man! Just a huge talent and so hot! Lol. Keep this amazing shit up!
:-)
Wow
This is art
Two words... Holy....Fuck...
It was good
EPIC
HOW DOES THE STORY NEXT?!?!?!?  CONTINUED PLEASE ??
I love it that is amazing I am singing when you sing too
Brutal gut !
Somebody - Whis styles Ronnie Radke can sing? Ronnie Radke - Yes! I guess 😂😂😂
I also feel constantly pregnant because I'm always throwing up. I'm not an addict, I just got mad panic and anxiety.
Amazing !!!! Woow
If you guys even remotely think this is comparable to the original, you're not a true fan. Trying too hard
Uploaded Feb 12? Where the fuck was I?
Huge production, but drug in me is you is much more melodic and remarkable
Ronny perdió el estilo antes el era un ganster ahora parece un cantante de pop todo el odio que el tenia en sus canciones lo hacían sentir especial ahorita ya no es rock lo que el hace, estoy muy decepcionado, no por nada se fue vincent
Mãe, não era só uma fase. 2021 e eu aqui chorando com esse som.
I really wish they changed the lyrics or somthing cuz this song is about someone being an addict.... now hes trying to put a twilight spin on it.... makes no sense...  the song is called "IM NOT A VAMPIRE" not "twilight 13: the revenge of ronnie"
Just wauw what master of music
The way he sings one omfg pop off 😍😍😍
Wow 👏
Ronnie’s revamped/reimagined work is amazing because it brings a whole new type of element and feeling to his music...it’s beautiful
Lestat has entered the chat.
Literally brought tears to my eyes. So beautiful!!!
Beauty
Dang , ronnie voice getting more battter nowdays
AMAZING, I LOVO YOU RONNIE. I LOVE FALLING IN REVERSE
Ronnie, You've done it once again. <3 I love your music! Even the calmer ones then dives into screaming. It's my favorite. Keep it up <3
How can anyone hate this song? I don't get it. It's a damn masterpiece listened to it over 20 times. Can't get enough, and get chills everytime. New fan to Falling in reverse and I love them. Ronnie your a genius at your craft and have an amazing voice. Can't wait to see what you guy's come up with next.
...
I just cant explain how good I feel listening to this! I didnt stop to listen "I'm not a Vampire" when I grew up and now I have a new goth version to listen too! AMAZING
very abd
wtf is this?
This song and video was absolutely fucking breathtaking! He never Fails! The lyrics, the set, the effects and the acting! Bravo!!
Falling in Reverse was the band that made me emo and this song is literally turning me into a middle school fangirl again
the vocals omggg it also hits so different on 1.25 speed it’s v intense
His vocal talents are insane
Unpopular opinion, the original was better.   This one seems like repressed and not emotional enough
1 month later and I still listen to it every day
You can see how broken this men is...
Ronnie is so so perfect ✨
Este video es simplemente ✨ARTE ✨
Ich liebe diese Musik. Der Mann hat so eine geile Stimme. Nur er kann Rap und Metall so perfekt verbinden.
this is my favorite thing ever 😥💜
Masterpiece
so cringe
OMFG  I LOVE THIS
Damn its been a while since ive seen Ronnie without face tats
Plot twist, he's actually a vampire.
whoever replaced tom cruise with ronnie for interview with a vampire needs a promotion immediately
WOW.  This version...this MV!!  Holy shit, it's fucking beautiful.   And was that the same house from Palaye Royale's "Tonight Is The Night I Die" video?
Сука бомба, аж до мурашек
Original is wayyyyyy better
I thought that was Tommy Wiseau for about half of this
Это пздс как круто👍👍👍услада для ушей🤤🤤🤤
Oscars, golden globe, master piece right here. Best video I've seen in a long time.
Holy shit this hit differently
What kind of powerful song from Ronnie Radke. Awesome. It makes me cry, give me power, let me shaking all this time. You voice is not from this earth. Wow wow wow
3:50 those vocals wow 😳😳😲😲
He finally got his choir
My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.
This is not just a song. This is a deeply metaforical piece of art. I feel Ronnie’s despair just building up to a climax to reach : F IT ALL mode! My opinion. I relate so so much to this song/ Lyrics . Phenomenal. I love both versions on this . 👌🏼🇳🇴💯
I personally prefer the original song but this music video thooooo
how does this have 3 million views but popular monster has over 55million? popular monster is literally the worst song ever
the last high note, OMG bruh!!! Absolutely talent, daamn!!
This song has such a nymphetamine feel to it. You shouldn't take that in a bad way. I really enjoy this song. Its absolutely amazing! Please don't change what you're doing.
Just my opinion! , but this video should be made into a Movie!!!.....Wow!....😮😮😮
Louie, always whining. Awesome vid. Unreal song thank you.
No doubt why Ronnie said he's an addict. Addicted on making his masterpiece into a legendary piece 🥰
this is twighlight fanfiction
This version fucking sucks I remember when he wrote music instead of just revamping his old shit
No comparison to Ronnie Radke  but this is one of the best remixes by far.
This reminds me of that one movie, i cant remember the name tho
There both so pretty
There both so pretty
am i the only one that thinks that singing  Well, I can lure any woman that I want to in my bed With me on a fucking weird sad symohonic song is a little bit weird?
Piece of a voice! 🤘
This is so fucking good!
I love these versions.. they bring so much more attention to the lyrics. Emotion that he couldn't convey with the upbeat tone of the originals.  I love these, and I feel they'll bring more people into this type of music, people who otherwise wouldn't have tried it. Ronnie deserves to be on a pedestal like that if Beethoven and Bach, if there were music to represent a generation, I'd be honored to have his represent us
Really hope he does more songs cause there is a bunch more that would sound awesome
An Epic!
no
This was beautiful
The people who disliked need a covid test, because they have no taste o.ô
😕
Bester Episch  was willst da sagen Best ever  mach weiter so und Bier für alle
I normally hate revamps but the band is so epic when they re-due it. Everyone gives only credit to the singers, I like to recognize the band as a whole, without their talents the singer would not have as much impact on their videos. Think about it.. what makes a horror movie more scary and terrifying? it's slow to fast music and the beats, and tempo that speed up your heart like any song.
I'm totally in love, holy shit.
This song is amazing, is not easy to revamp a song so famous without fail!! Great Ronnie!!
This shows solists of my favourite groups arent just screaming, they got amazing vocal talents. Go on what you are doing Ronnie you are the best. I want to show the people who say they are just screaming, no they are not and when they scream they scream things that has meanings. These songs are really bops. I really dont want my music taste to change so much so i can still listen to these
I’ve already commented once but 1 month later and I’ve decided this song is a masterpiece. Inspiring and soul touching. Totally fanboying out now 😂
Holy shit
How can it be so edgy, yet so good?
Anyone in my car "oh I like this song who is it by" oh its just falling in reverse next song "whos this ".....Ronnie listen my whole Playlist is just falling in reverse because I'm obsessed with him.
Ronnie is a better and hotter vampire than Robert Pattinson or Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt. Who also wants a vampire movie with Ronnie as the leading actor?
They're so gorgeous Q___Q
Suddenly remembered movie with Johnny Depp (2012)
FUCKING MASTERPIECE
Poetry!!
I  get why he  left....
Omg!!! I'm in love!😍
Instantly one of my fav's, duh
yes.
5 words: THIS IS A FUCKING MASTERPIECE!!!
Such an incredible version
Yoooo...this is so beautiful and sad now...🖤
I need more of this in my life. The drug in me is reimagined and this have ruined all other music for me and I need more.
This is epic
A master piece! To be honest, I didn´t like the original version, but this one I realy love! Can´t stop hearing it!
Wowww this is amazing especially the end
Every time I watch this video I get Miss murder VIBES AFI
Amazing nothing more to say
Totally forgot I had a goth kink back in the day til I saw this
На высоте, как всегда.
''revamped'' i see what you did there ^-^
my last confession is here: I never liked the experimentation of this group. but this experiment is absolutely satisfactory! hear me! Please continue this way.
Lockdown
this is a confession! 3 million of the number of views belongs to me.
Solid Twilight vibes!
I think it has moved me to a different time, where the bands were incredible. Amazing song
Amazing !
Epic
yeah yeah that's it that's it!!!
this and the drug in me is you remakes are literal perfection. beautiful art.
THESE GUYS ARE ON A WHOLE NEW LEVEL NOW!
Ronnie has always been impressive as a vocalist, with a unique voice and pretty meaningful lyrics. I hope dudes doing well and still looks up to his idols. Fuck Craig Mabbit
The way this hit is so damn hard it is like you can feel it to your soul. Epic song I love it
That was fuckin beautiful.
🖤❤️🖤❤️🖤🎈
Интересно, кто раньше напишет рок оперу Ронни или BMTH?
<3 !!!!!
this version of the song sounds much more harmonious than the original version, it is several times more emotional than the original version, I would like to hear more similar works because as for me, this genre fully reveals the talent of the artist
Paige wwe ?
I bet Ronnie wrote this song with his own blood.
I appreciate this but I liked the faster tempo of the original it’s still good though
eu te amo ronnie vampiro eu te amo
hi my name is ronnie im an addict😛☝️
2:39 what you searched for
This was fucking amazing. RIP Derek Jones.
I LOVE YOU RONNIE <3 <3 <3
howd he get the greybeards from skyrim in this ? songs next level!!!
This deserves awards. 🥇
He did it again... Fuck this is so good
this is beautiful
I prefer the original tho
Even i couldn't take this kind of awesome!
Is that paige?
Well damn, this wasn't what I was expecting 0-0 but still good
Oh God,  this is so good
PUTA MERDA, oq esse homem faz q não fica perfeito. Arrepiei
Observation: the only part where Ronnie multi layers his voice that overpowers and with a multitude of clearance in his voice the is the "Hi my name is Ronnie, I'm an addict."  Observation: in the video he walks to the door with a reassurance in his new found abilities yet he find himself in the position to be reviewed via 2 different versions of authority. The current being the police and his mystical past being the bearded village person of his power, noted via his tome. He is shown 2 pictures and turns his head and shakes no, yet his that slight smirk of contempt for lies before him.   Its full circle folks, presented in such a short frame of the video....  Absolutely brilliant
This is progression folks, the evolution is real.
Tbh I love this type of music better than his old music, though his old music was fabulous too. XP
GRAMMY - WORTHY !! I‘m speechless... I feel truly sorry for all the people who haven’t found this song yet 😂
I went to a program after this came out to stop drinking. I had it in my head for this whole time. I wrote it down word for word. Sing the way he did lol. It feels good to listen to it again. So talented. I just ordered the tix for April. Yay
the video makes me wanna get bitten by a vampire
Beautiful and poetic. My new favorite.
This is amazing work of art!!! Amazing!!!!
This version is giving me corpse bride vibes and I love it
I liked the first the one but damn so beautiful just like the redo of the drug in me is you, 🥰🥰🖤💜🌹🌹
I cant stop hearing that song! It is so epic! Headset on max volume and FIRE! <3 Good Job Ronnie Radke :)
Reimagined and revamped are both incredible
GREAT🔥
I love him rapping. But goodness I missed him singing
Chills. Literal chills
Ayeee the lady in white is paige from WWE
OH MY GOD WHAT, I CAME HERE FOR THE ORIGINALS BUT THESE ARE SO SO GOOD.
Been a fan for a long time before the betrayal of ETF. (I troll them often lolz) Loved the revamp of the drug in me..... With that said this was too much! Tone it down just a little. It could of done without the last 45secs “I’m a Mf vampire “ it was to corny my guy. Still rooting for you!!!
music sucks today
This is ronnies world we just live here. This man is a fucking GOD
wow - would love Ronnie's approval to do a review on this and get his post reaction - what a powerful music video!
In love with everything about this
love this to bits
MASTER PIECE!!!!
The original song was better.
Who is the female lead in this? I'd like to know her name.
I wonder if Ronnie secretly wants to be a vampire
Лучшее что видел и слышал за последнее время.
Who's that girl ?
these lyrics are so awful and try-hard
OMG, its very nice!!!
Maybe I shouldn’t have skipped the emo phase this shit is immaculate 🪄✨
What's up w these weird dramatic remakes ?  What's your demographics ?  Not your fans obviously. If you remember right we became fans through your metal content, when you actually released music not cash grab trash.  But hey I guess enjoy your mansions. The video was ok tho. Not being a dick either, just honest.
As a fan of horror, and a fan of FIR, this couldn’t have been a better marriage made in Heaven.
This is like really really good right? Gives me chills
Bruh....
Can we PLEASE have a 'Raised by wolves' werewolf video? at least a reimagined version! that was my favorite song!!
Gives me dark shadows vibes (the movie with Johnny depp in it)
This man is a genius artist and I never considered him a vampire until I heard the original song and was like “I didn’t think you were but now that you brought it up?” Glad to see he’s out of the denial phase.   On a different note this man and his band are genius artists and just give them all the awards and let them and Willow have a tea party with the Two Rocking Grannies. They all deserve it. As soon as everyone is vaccinated.
This video is amazing! Not only does the song sound fantastic, the video just outs a whole new spin on it. Thumbs up for the amazing work! Falling in Reverse just outdoes themselves over and over again.
восторг!!! восторг!!! восторг!!! это неописуемо прекрасно!!!
I love how this is out around the same time the RE:8 demo is  They're both vampire themed
Bro I’m fucking SHOOK
Dide lets fucking GOOOOOOO!!!
This video and son deserves rewards imo🔥
Гениално...вы супер ребята..как всегда..но тут...удивили
Fucking brilliant
Ronnie are you run out of ideas? 👀 I love their songs but this was just an exellent song, and now looks like a joke 🤔
This music video is just amazing, art direction on point.
i LOVE this
If Falling in Reverse drops a new interpretation of their own song you know your gonna get goosebumps the second when the screen starts turning orange. same in the drug in me is reimagined
I want to see Phantom of the Opera with Ronnie as the Phantom.
Go Ron Bon go 🥺💖
Nothing but hits from them since Ronnie came back. Every single song is a banger.
freaking mega, monumental work of art. goosebumps. masterpiece👏
Can he just make a movie?
Bruh. THIS WAS FUCKING AWESOME.
Ok. This like the opposite of The Vampires Will Never Hurt You by My Chemical Romance
wow.....Ronnie....its....wow
1:20-1:52 Ain't that the phucking truth
Been listening to FIR for over 10 years ..& Ronnie your music is beyond incredible forreal...you are talented on another level and I love everything about your song writing.. all of this you are putting out now is straight up amazing ...it’s gold!!!!! Ronnie you are the most DOPE artist ever I’ll say it alllllll dayyyy!!!
I feel like all the new versions of the old songs are a big flex to show everyone the range of music they could make
Beautifully done! Love the original and now this new revamped! My condolences btw, please be strong Ronnie you're doing a great job!
Жалко что лайк несколько раз не прожимается
Now this is a Video worthy of So much more then Movie credits. His Vocals are amazing so dynamic, And its original not NORMAL. Most of the music out now is a repeat of Histories Music Scene from Years Past.   Keep up the Music.
I'm the reason this song has so many views
Speechless.....#wow......
My life. This is the one what an amazing change Ronnie
2:40 is the part you came for
This is frikkin epic!
There is no way guys like this band. Ice nine kills all day
This is amazing! Wow!
Ronnie I cannot stress how badly we need you. You guys are a breath of fresh air in an overly processed fast food music scene. Please keep doing this, striving on creating fresh sounds we absolutely need. Your music nurtures our starved souls, I do not say that lightly in all sincerity. I’m 50 and just recently discovered your music I’m sort I didn’t find it at 40 Thank you beyond measure for what you give us so freely from your soul...Namaste
Man I want to write a short story based on this now. Except, the locals don't think he's a vampire. They just think he's some dude in a fancy house who's still in his edgy goth phase
Damn Ronnie. Made me cry brother. Good shit my man.
When are we getting a Falling in Reverse musical? Can't get enough of these re-makes!
I'm pretty sure we need a whole album that is "revamped" inspired with just the piano, strings, and choir. That would be 🔥🔥🔥
Why it's so amazing 🦇🦇🦇 Lestat reborn
Both versions are absolutely amazing
Damn.. CHILLS...
" ONLY WATER" LMAO........
Meu deus! Que foda! Que voz! Que emoção! Me arrepiei completamente. Agora não paro de escutar.
This is undoubtedly a magnum opus.
3:23 Remember me Castlevania SOTN Dracula's prologue
Someone grew up watching meatloaf.   This is awesome
perfeição
Was never a fan of falling in reverse in the early 2000s but this new stuff is unbelievable. This may be an old song but the delivery is insane. You could perform songs like this in a theater in front of thousands.
All I can say is Beautiful!
I’m in love with both songs💕
I guess Ronnie took a Snicker lmao also love this version
Magnifique 😻
PAAAAAAIGEEEEEEEE!!!!!
When you run out of ideas just remake all your original songs :P Seriously though if this is how it was originally I wouldnt have hated their first album so much.
Ronnie: “mothers better Lock your doors and hide your daughters”  Mothers & daughters: *oh trust us, we won’t*
ME DREAMING:  I said "Wow!! I love how these music videos are more like high quality movies! I hope he keeps makes more of them"  ME AWAKE:  Ronnie "HERE YA GO!"
welcome .. .  .   .    .     .      .       .       .        .          .           .      .       .       .      .     .    .   .  . we've been waiting for you.
Ronnie is such a gem 💎👑🤩  This song just gave me chills
i hope i hear this in a movie someday <3
When you realize 2.7k people wouldnt know talent if it beat them over the head
I have listened to this song all day, and hearing Ronnie’s voice moved me. The emotion in his voice, Especially at 3:46.❤️😭❤️😭❤️😭❤️😭❤️😭❤️😭❤️😭❤️😭
dammmmnnn i love this thanks ronnie radke
This song is a fucking masterpiece.
Is that Paige from wwe or am I trippin
Its paige 🤩🤩
Tienes que hacerla en vivo y con orquesta ahora...
Epitaph Records be like "I don't care about you guys, we know you'll find the lyrics some how"
hi my name is ronnie im an addict
Wasn’t expecting that 😳 actually got chills after the first line.
I would love to see some clips of him singing in the studio
5:09 killed it
Sounds like something a vampire would say... @_@
OH MY FUCKINH GOD, HOW I LOVE FALLING IN REVERSE AND RONNIE IS MY RELIGION
this means sm to me lol
We need not good enough again for the truth in cliche
2:39 I CAN'T STOP PLAYING THIS PART IN REPEAT!!
Just got introduced to Ronnie watching a KnoxHill reaction. I had to see this in full screen! The story, music, the whole package of awesomeness. Much respect. I don't have the right words to express how excellent this is!
Rip Derek Jones
I like how they went with reVAMPed instead of reimagined that's clever
Please make a song like this with Evanescence
Aaaaaaaa. Its very good
Beautiful song
Simply Wow
Ronnie being a monster again
Just Beautiful
Theatrical
Love this!! Just, why there's Paige twice in some scene? She's rethinking of moment with Ronnie ? She's dead?
loving thee revamped versions boys, it's telling another story in one sense.
BLOWN AWAY
i miss the "hi ronnie" a little xDD
Completely wonderfully amazingly cinematic
Holy fucking shit this is AMAZING
Very dramatic and beautiful but ronnie said it's better than the original and that the original was cringe .. and I just can't agree like THE ORIGINAL HAS A MASSIVE PLACE IN MY HEART and it can't be touched
Better twiling
That was cool
So Powerful With Visuals I Love This  Orchestrations Are On Point With A Solid Rocker   V-rOcKs PiT  🤘💀🤘
Espectacular!!! ♥️♥️♥️ Cariños desde Argentinagentina
Caraleoo
Ohhhhhhhhhhh  my goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I i i have paranoia
BravO!!!! Perfect! Mingblowing! Thank you, Ronnie! You are the one of the best in the world! We are all with you!
😍😍😍😍 I don't have words, this is brilliant
NO PUEDO PARAR DE ESCUCHAR ESTA BELLEZA
As usual, the lyrics transcend god and science and everything that moves mankind deeply
I'm not vampire
You feel the emotions and passion so much in the song. 🖤👏 Amazing voice 👌🤘
Just wow
I don’t know if Mr. Radke himself will see this, but that last line or two before song ends - instant chills, man !!!!! The whole song is amazing though, of course.
loved the original, this one gives interview with a vampire a run for its money 🩸
oh okay i see what you did their "revamped" haha
that was literally amazing i cant stress it enough
15 year old me is screaming
Can't wait to watch the Feb 2022 revamped
5:30 perfect 🤌
I suddenly forgot the lyrics LMFAO T_T
I simply love this song! Ronnie’s doing an amazing job with his singing, whether he’s screaming, belting or whispering. Both the lyrics and the video have a nice bond together since it’s from the same vampire universe, which I really like. I also love how there’s another message behind the words he’s singing (drug addiction, but correct me if I’m wrong). Overall, the dark mood, Ronnie’s voice and the theme of this project is breathtaking. I highly recommend you to listen to the whole thing if you haven’t already :)
There's not many songs + music video duos that I can say rewrite the expectations and set new standards for how majorly a band can change. The last song (minus a music video) that changed my perspective on what music could achieve was the "Exogenesis Symphony Pts. 1-3" Muse released in 2009. That song is a masterpiece that redefined what music could do.      This though...the narrative, the characters, the complete rewrite of an old hard rock song to this theatrical, operatic, symphonic legend.....this is next level, seriously upper echelon music theory reconstruction. Having a degree in audio engineering I can attest to how hard it is to reformat a song both in instruments used, rhythm and melody alternated, and tempo changes that coordinate with the key signature. I will get this song into a major film before I die, even if I have to start a GoFundMe just to get there.       In YouTube land, everything is mocked and criticized and satirized and shredded...because that's what PC culture is teaching people. You can't say anything you feel like in public for fear of offending others, so YouTube has become the platform everyone vents their acrimony anonymously. This song and this video though, I have nothing bad to say in the slightest. For the first time in a long, long time. Thank you Epitaph for shelling out the money for decent composers, lyricists, FX people, stunt coordinators, Foley artists, the entire male orchestra in the back, and a storyline as gritty, dark, and haunting as Ronnie Radke is as a person. Legend.
wn el ronnie se ve rarosin los tatuajes xdxdxd
🇵🇭🔥
Me: blasting this song in traffic Chorus: he’s not a vampire  Me: turning down the volume Ronnie screaming:  turns back up
This is a masterpiece.
By the way...my favorite song ...since I was a baby is "War Pigs" by Black Sabbath  ... this guy gets me. I have hissed at the sun many times. Some people bask in the sunlight....I bask in the Moonlight.  Always have...Always  will. But, blood tastes like pennies. Gross LOL
Like this version better.  Other one is cool...but...fuck...this guy is so multiply talented.  This is epic. And kudos to the guy who makes his videos.  🤘
I can't help it I just HAVE to watch this MV or listen to the song at least 5 times a day, it's just so good.
I need more!!!
I feel like he took thia song that was more like him being a "typical punkish rapper" with some things in it that had meaning and turned it into something he truly had passion for after all the years. This legit brings me close to tears everytime i watch it and its so intense but calming. The choir give you that roman vampire vive and his screams make you feel his pain and suffering.   That was my rant (sorry)
damn. nostalgic asf.
Legit almost cried cause I'm lame but this was awesome
Someone else read the Strahd Campaign I see.
Ronnie is a Legend!
wow hace mucho tiempo que no escuchaba un buen tema , esta cancion , la produccion y todo lo demas estuvo excelente , mis felicitaciones a la banda , ya tienen un nuevo seguidor
Make more songs like this
Só queria um filme com esse cenário, e com as música dele 🖤
Damn, I was not expecting to be blessed by a masterpiece jfc.
Just...Wow. It's so powerful. I am in love, Ronnie, his wife,  wonderful.
I'm crying... This is so fucking awesome!!!
in "the drug in me is reimagined" we can see his fangs while he plays piano
На сколько же это шедеврально, я не верил, что в 2021 году еще есть люди, которые могут делать такие сильные вещи.
The hair is killing me
Okay. He took the oringinal, and COMPLETELY changed the song. With the same lyrics. AND, made me want to see him play the Vampire lestat.
Ronnie is the best ever
Why am I a month late to this???? Ronnie get it boy! This is sick.
Fucking amazing!!!!!!
Ronnie’s singing skills is absolute fire fucck man
Bravo...bravo...get chills goodjob
still get amazed how he can turn his own classics into smth new and tbh better
Well...ok then
Это бесподобно!!! Лучший!
Amazing video and I love this song!!
Ronnie is the best R.I.P
Paige!!!!
He looks so weird without his tattoos lol, great song tho
Drug in me reimagined, or this 🤔 can't decide, too much greatness
Get song to 3 mil Club. Let's go!
Please do a remake of phantom.of.the opera
Okay, but Ronnie has to be a vampire if he's 37 and looks this youthful!
How Twilight had been be like
3:33
Falling in Reverse- I’m not a vampire;  Re-𝓥𝓪𝓶𝓹𝓮𝓭 👁👄👁
The idea of Vampires has obvious roots in addiction, so it's no wonder he was able to make his irreverent song of addiction transition seamlessly into the tragedy of Vampirism. I had chills the entire time watching this, and I've only read Interview With A Vampire of this series while I think this video probably covers other books as well to tell an entire story, but I say this was crazy awesome!
omgg xD
Make a movie out of it, please I need it. 😭🩸
"Hi my name is...Runny, I'm an...attic" I'm dying y'all really be hyping this shit up?
This man is sitting here acting like a tormented musician ,all while being cracked at COD warzone
They said there will never again be a vocalist as versatile as Freddy Mercury....I beg to differ, I think he has met his match...maybe even his superior.
Really good but again, I hope your not this tortured irl
Just OH MY GOD
This mansion looks like the scene from Stay Alive Horror Movie
i love it so much guys, i love this):
Damn Ronnie cute
❤️❤️❤️❤️🧛🏻‍♀️🧛🏻‍♀️🧛🏻‍♀️
2:39 in 1.75 speed. ur welcome.
Yall are seriously feeling this song? As someone who grew up with falling in reverse I think this is terrible lol
Ron Bon what are you doing⁉️
It's strange to see him without tattoos
Even my 9 year old likes the clean version
5:45; best finale
Next step is GLEE
This is a Movie not a MV omg
Wtf RONNIE HACE ARTE
Was that a pun? Revamped either way it works
Rest in POWER dj
damn...we can feel that Ronnie did really come a long way since the original song...
Power House of a voice! Magnifico 👌😘
"And mothers, it's better lock your daughters and hide your doors" that part hitted me
.... holy fucking god this is absolutely amazing I can’t describe this holy shit !!
And after all that. I think i need a glass of whiskey and a cig. Even though i don't actually drink. So i'd go for a pint of blood straight from the vein. Mmm lovely. Nice warm blood. Haa, Haa, Haa, Haaaaaa!!!!!!!........
This video was almost like watching a movie!!
I really wasn't expecting this at all, but it's really fucking good.  Now, if INK could do a cover of this version - that would be sick.
Straight fucking fire!
omg, this is amazing. I grew up listening to this band but it still surprises me and I love this creativity and Ronnie's talent more every day
PLEASE DO CHEMICAL PRISONER NEXT! By far the best FIR song!
Difiicl deixar de ser emo desse jeito, pqp ! Foda pra caralhoooooo
SO FUCKIN GOOD!
Epic!  Even better than The Drug In Me!  You really are the king of the music scene!
I love that the line "Daddy never should have raised me on Black Sabbath" completely changes context with this revamp. In the original it referenced the band, here it is referencing an actual Black Sabbath. Very neat twist. 2:46
Ronnie has the power of turning an emo song into a sad masterpiece ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I’ve been going through a lot lately and  I’ve listened to this song multiple times and I just got done listening to this song . , while I was listening to this song my whole entire body had chills , I finally started crying and  let all emotions out. Thank you Ronnie and the whole band for letting me know how to feel again.
this is the shit. he's the shit
I've been listening to his music since I was in high school and I'll be 32 this year this guy has come such a long way love Falling in Reverse Ronnie is amazing
"I'm Not A Vampire" Not to be "that guy", but he's clearly a vampire
ronnie is aro now
HOLY FUCKING SHIT? THE PRODUCTION IS A1 IN EVERYTHING FROM MUSIC TO RONNIE TO THE MV.
How "Breaking Dawn" should be and be over ...
i feel like everyone knew Ronnie could sing. but i feel like very little (of his fans) knew he is very capable of compositions like this.
why just I noticed this 🥺 i love all of your song.. i mean this genre... ❣️love from Malaysia
Wow.
Can they please do this with the westerner??? I've always sung that song in my head as a ballad and it would be fucking awesome to hear Ronnie do it
damn it, this is fucking awesome
Can't seem to find a comment about it - so for everyone who doesn't know: Ronnie is a very active streamer at https://www.twitch.tv/ronnieradke :) - Enjoy and have a wonderful day <3
I discover this version but it's a masterpiece and very emotive, the music and the clip are amazing ! It looks real or just like I was watching a movie, then with the epic vibes it's impressive !
Holy crap this is a masterpiece!!
I need a full album of reimagined
Woooah wait lmao IT TOOK ME THIS LONG TO REALIZE THE REASON HE LOOKS SO DIFFERENT IS BECAUSE HIS TATTOOS ARE GONE I'M SO STUPID 😂
This 6 minutes eargasm is a better love story than Twilight
If he doesn’t win an award for this idk what we have come to
This ver is better than the shitty emo version
Почему это так охуенно?
The song that got me started on this band after ronnie left escape the fate
Did anyone else start crying after the “in loving memory of Derek Jones”
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ronnie is becoming the soundtrack to my life.
😳😳😳😳😳🤩
I love how Paige (Saraya-Jade) is in this as his love interest when they're actually a beautiful couple in real life. Absolutely breathtaking song.
Im pretty sure that the woman in the video is former WWE wrestler Paige. Great to see her still doing stuff
Ебать, а что так жестко... Мое уважение
My little brother actually told me about Ronnie and I don’t regret it. These songs are amazing and gave me another reason to bond with my brother ☺️ honestly didn’t expect to be taken in this epic ride of a song.
holy shit .. that was epic
Ronnie Ronnie Ronnie !!
Is that Paige from WWE?
Ronnie hes probably one of the best vocal artists out right now he's still holding it down wow he's very talented.
Every one of these that gets put out just makes me think that Ronnie's making the music he feels he should've instead of what he did. These alternates have as much or more passion than the originals
Muito booom caralhooooooo ❤️
"And whiskey seems to be my holy water" that line is so powerful for me. This whole song is amazing especially considering I hated the original
I love Paige
This video is stunning.  Man.
il devrait tellement en faire plus de ce genre de musique :D
OMG THAT WAS SOOOOOOO GOOD LOVE IT!!
i think i just caught A SERIOUS  head change ITS FIRE
Man. Every time he sings, “Hi my name is Ronnie. I’m an addict.” I get chills. I’ve listened to the song a million times. The way the instruments cut out and his voice. Amazing!!
Beautiful! I see visions. Anne Rice. Interview with a vampire. Buffy. The Vampire Diaries! Vampire RPing games. This hit really hard. But I am out of whiskey... so I go straight to the store tomorrow morning to get a bottle, and put this song on repeat the whole day whilst watching Buffy on DVD, The Vampire Diaries on Netflix, whilst also reading Anne Rice and playing The Elder Scrolls online on my Woodelf Vampire.
wow
I'm going to ask this once: COMPOSE A BROADWAY MUSICAL.
So freaking gooooood..🥲🥀🖤
👁️‍🗨️🤙👼🌠🌪️☯️⛩️💉😷😵
Help my dad has been talking about this for the past week and is now making me play it
this is amazing what
I PREFERE THE EMO VERSION
Most people: You can't mix more than one music type without making it sound bad. Ronnie: You want to see
Love this, hoping for alone next
🕸
If this doesn't get featured in some big movie. I will literally commit Not-Alive.
can we talk about how good ronnie looks in this video
The best!!!.
Yes Ronnie, I listen this 5 times a day
So, they took that cool and kinda funny song and made this? 🤣 That's so insane🤣
Шедевр
The 2,5 k dislikes should be ashamed of themselves. HOW CAN YOU NOT APPRECIATE A MASTERPIECE LIKE THIS????
Is this Paige Knight???
Cadê os amigos BR?
Amazing. Imagine a duet whit Ronnie Radke & Amy Lee
this is art 🖤
R.I.P. Derek Jones ❤️
oh fuck me thats brilliant
Art.
we need "brother" reimagined, that would be beautiful
You made me paint again. Great guitars and drums!!!
Should win a grammmmmmmmmmmmy!!!!!!!!
This is fucking amazing
I know the perfect song for you to reimagine next. Raised by wolves it has the lyrics and feeling to be amazing in this style of music
Love and adore this version so much! Feels like a more authentic version, and the original is hollywood.
Soo F*CKIN talented Ronnie! I love these revamped versions you do, brings a whole new feeling & story. Always gives me chills & some tears.  Your voice is beautiful
Paige is truly awesome👌🏻🥺😍
Love from Indian🇮🇳
raised by wolves next!
I'm really impressed by the orchestral works in this
Thank fuck, bring back cool fucking vampires.
Put* goosebumps ❤
Rock music videos are art omfg that was amazing
Never heard of them until coronavirus.   I love his voice and I've seen this video line 25 times since it came out.  I also love WWE so it doesnt hurt that Paige is in the video.
😍😍😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Good, this one doesn’t have a racist star in it.
I was speechless, there is no doubt that Ronnie always knows how to improve songs. And what a beautiful video in memory of Derek, we love you Ronnie <3...From Mexico
I think he should make another video like a second part of this one. Using this video like it was a vision of his vamp abilities and he foresaw what was gonna happened, preventing her suicide and running away before those people got there and he then turning her and she now understanding him then his point of view from his life. I loved the video...
I didn’t think the drug in me is reimagined could be too but this blow passed my imagination it has ever more grit and dynamic than the Latin love the choir
Tell me why this is in a mix of Christian songs lol
This is a piece of 🎨 !
Man ran out the house so fast he lost his jacket 😭😂
I'm always amazed how well he can sing.  I was blown away hearing his voice live at a show.
This Song is fucking good. I love it.
Holy shit is best
Why did I discover this just now?🥺
This is fuckin terrible
Fucking masterpiece 🤦🏻🤘🏻🔥
Uufufufufufufyfy EVEREVERVERRR THE BESTTTTTTTTT RONNIEEE
I'm not a big fan of this band, but OMG, THIS SONG, OMG!!!!!
I love it , it was so beautiful 🤧
🔥🔥🤘🏻🤘🏻🔥🔥
Quando sai a versão da música "Situations - Escape the fate"?
The music is incredible. Would've been a masterpiece if it wasn't for the terrible vox
Ronnie, you’re a musical mastermind man.
This guy will forever be a legend
This track hits soo hard that it sent chills down my spine
Is there anything he CANT DO? 😯😆🔥😅❤️🏆
Well, I'm not a vampire, but I feel like one Sometimes I sleep all day 'cause I hate the sunlight My hands are always shaking Body's always aching, and the dark is when I feed Well, I can lure any woman that I want to in my bed with me  And whiskey seems to be my holy water And mothers, better lock your doors and hide your daughters  'Cause I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold? For goodness sakes, where is my self-control? If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all hope  Well, I'm not a zombie, but I feel like one today Self-induced comatose, chemical daze My head is always spinning from this dizzy blurry vision and my stomach has had enough I feel like a lady that is pregnant with a baby 'cause I'm always throwing up  And hi, my name is Ronnie, I'm an addict And daddy should've never raised me on Black Sabbath  I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold? For goodness sakes, where is my self-control? If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all hope  When will you mortals believe? (He's not a vampire) I just want the world to bleed (He's not a vampire) Lust at the sight of your blood (He's not a vampire) I swear to God, I am not a... (He is not a...) (He is not a...)  So God bless all of you now 'Cause I'm going straight to Hell (Straight to Hell) And I'm taking you down with me Because you know damn well  So I sharpen my teeth 'cause I love the way it feels When I sink into your skin and draw the only thing that's real You don't believe me, should I write it in blood? You better drive that fucking stake right down my heart and try to run Motherfucker, I'm a vampire  And I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold? For goodness sakes, where is my self-control? If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all Heart has fucking lost all Heart has lost all hope (He's lost all hope) (He's lost all hope) All hope (He's lost all hope) My heart has lost all hope
Аж до мурашек! Шедеврально!!!
Came here for Paige 😍😍😍
Pure art 🎨
Cecilion and carmila's love
Without his face tats he and willow look SO alike!
gonna say this again that I'm not a big fan but I'm just so proud of Ronnie. He's such a talented individual. I love how he changed this to a completely different song just like what he did to The Drug In Me is You. And btw his hairstyle here looks so good.
Just heard this track for the first time.  The only other track from this band I am aware of is Popular Monster.  But this track?  Starts as ballad, tells a tragic--nearly operatic--story, using metal vocal intensity, a choir, and poppy, melodies bridged over some damn fine piano playing.  This song is all over the map and my brain is still processing this.  I think I like it though.
This is the best thing I've heard and seen so far in my entire 17 years of live
show de bola
TENGO LA PIEL CHINTA, jODER!!!! ESTO ES ORO PURO HABER ESCUCHADO LA PRIMERA VERSION HACE AÑOS EN MI ADOLESCENCIA Y LUEGO ESTO KJADKSJDFBSK!!!! ESTE HOMBRE TIENE LA MAS HERMOSA VOZ!!!
This is epic!
my god this was fucking beautiful
Love to hear a mashup with Meatloaf's I Would Do Anything For Love.
This was like a dark opera 💀 I got lost in this for sure.
..am..am I finally falling in love with falling in reverse..? Is this happening..?
Lol
is that PAIGE from WWE?
:/ Jesus christ ..
How did I not know this existed 😳
when you go from an emo teen to a refined goth adult
I’m like spam replaying this song everyday since it came out 😝 please do all your songs from escape the fate remastered omg *fan girling*
Who ever disliked this is lying to themselves this is beyond words incredible
I legit had chills the entire time listening to this
Tiny Tim is that you!?
Every *emo girl* crush of 2015
AMAZING.....
Man.....
So I  scanned the comments for someone mentioning, how that scene where he turns her (4:35) is very much like the scene in Interview with the Vampire, where Lestat turns Louis. I didn't find any though, so now I'm here. Pointing it out. I mean the way he bites his wrist, the dripping of the blood, and how she clings to his arm to get more. It all felt very familiar.  It might just be a coincidence. But I really hope it's just a subtle tribute, and I'm very much here for it. Goodbye and thank you.
What a voice, 39yrs old and my first man crush
she i beautiful
Fashionable Late Revamped would be amazing
LOVE IT OMG
bro this is a BIG upgrade
This song is a masterpiece.
😍
Holy shat this is amazingggg
The soyboy breaking from his chains making him into a murderer. LOL!
IMHO the most fake, generic, over-produced garbage ever
that woman is so omg
hi my name is raW knëe 😀✨ i’m an attic 😔😔😔😰😨 and daddy should’ve never raised me on laxatives
I've had this song on repeat all day, I love this revamp.
Is Paige?
Paige...and song is amazing
Now that’s how you master a fucking song!
♥
Шедевр (вы вернули мне творческое вдохновение)
so bad
Production value is amazing, but I feel like something special is lost from the original. The crunchy beat and bumpy tone of the original was fitting for the melody. The slower tone of this one doesn't.
Well I'm not a vampire But I feel like one Sometimes I sleep all day Because I hate the sunlight My hands are always shaking Body's always aching And the dark is when I feed Well I can lure any woman that I want to in my bed With me And whiskey seems to be my holy water Mothers better lock your doors And hide your daughters I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness sake Where is my self control? If home is where my heart is Then my heart has lost all hope Well I'm not a zombie But I feel like one today Self induced comatose, chemical daze My head is always spinning From this dizzy, blurry vision And my stomach has had enough I feel like a lady That is pregnant with a baby 'Cause I'm always throwing up Hi, My name is Ronnie I'm an addict (Hi, Ronnie!) Daddy should've never raised me on Black Sabbath! I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness sake Where is my self control? If home is where my heart is Then my heart has lost all hope God bless all of you now 'Cause I'm going straight to Hell And I'm taking you down with me 'Cause you know damn well I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness sake Where is my self control? If home is where my heart is Then my heart has lost all hope All hope All hope
This is epic gamer moment

Increíble

Loveeeeeeeeeee it
#interviewwithronnie #inlove #ronnieradke

I can´t even express how much I like this...I was in awe for the entire song and it just kept getting better and better
Holy fucking shit
HOLY
I love you guy’s and you’re music video’s Thankyou
Dunno if its just me but this feels much more natural for the song, like this is how it was originally meant to be preformed, Ronnie has such an amazing vocal range and instrumental prowess, I fall in with the reimagined works
Then comes the operatic section
2:40
this is fucking amazing
I like the original but this one is really fucking good i like it better
oh my goodness 🥵😍💗
You, my friend, have to smoke a bit less of that SH*** XD,  Good music though, last part made me laugh uncontrollably XD
F***ing masterpiece!🇱🇺
Oh dang this is so much different!
Honestly I haven’t listened to anything that actually just shocked me to this level he needs to make a hole album like this it’s unbelievable
Well I'm not a vampire But I feel like one Sometimes I sleep all day Because I hate the sunlight My hands are always shaking Body's always aching And the dark is when I feed Well I can lure any woman that I want to in my bed With me And whiskey seems to be my holy water Mothers better lock your doors And hide your daughters I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness sake Where is my self control? If home is where my heart is Then my heart has lost all hope Well I'm not a zombie But I feel like one today Self induced comatose, chemical daze My head is always spinning From this dizzy, blurry vision And my stomach has had enough I feel like a lady That is pregnant with a baby 'Cause I'm always throwing up Hi, My name is Ronnie I'm an addict (Hi, Ronnie!) Daddy should've never raised me on Black Sabbath! I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness sake Where is my self control? If home is where my heart is Then my heart has lost all hope God bless all of you now 'Cause I'm going straight to Hell And I'm taking you down with me 'Cause you know damn well I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness sake Where is my self control? If home is where my heart is Then my heart has lost all hope All hope All hope
Ammazza che cagata!
Masterpiece!
Better like the older version of it but this is better for a movie track or something like that
hi 👋 my name 📛 is 🥺 runny ‼️im an attic 😜 daddy🐓 shouldve 🏃🏻never 🙊 raised 🔝 me ☝️😧on laxatives😡‼️
I became goosebumps from his voice..
im not a vampire. buuut i ammm mwhahhahah
Saraya is so beautiful.
Now it's almost impossible for me to remember the original version, since every single time I think of the song, this masterpiece plays in my head.
I listened the song until now because i thought that it wouldn't be amazing as The Drug Reimagined. I'm so sorry, Ronnie, i was clearly wrong
If this isn't in that new Lestat show that Anne Rice is making, imma flip my shit-
This is the serotonin I needed for my 2am depressive episode
This is what i called a perfection! I love you falling in reverse!
Holy...crap...this is amazing!!!
13 year old me... is shakin
This was the 1st song I used to test out my new air pods I got for my birthday. Definitely the best song to choose
Absolutely glad to continuously come back to this amazing cinematography and listen to the thunderous vocal abilities, yet sad to know that the next recreation of another old classic, if there is one, will come out early next year. Still grateful for "The Drug in Me Is You" and this one though!
This is sooo fucking good. wow
If this man isn't a genius...then nobody is
AAA I LOVE THIS
Wow. . . all I can really say.
Guys, I think he might be a vampire
He looks awesome! So happy this is out, I’ve been enjoying this so much
I respect people's opinions on just about everything, but if you don't like what you are hearing than you are not human you're a fuckin alien.
2:40
I cant stop watching this music video !!! Love saraya
I think we definitely need a 'Popular Monster Reimagined' at this point.
Emo's not dead!
WOW😯😯😯😯❤
You look so amazing as a vampire. I have fallen in love with this song and video.  again so amazing!!
5:43 and 3:51 hits different
THE FUCK IS THIS LMAOOO WHY WAS THIS MADE THE ORIGINAL WAS GREAT BUT WHAT IS THIS
Sup Davey Havok?
Never gets old! I come back here at least 3 times a day to watch!
Hay algo que esta banda no haga bien? De paso ella es Paige verdad ?
These reimagined songs are Ronnie's greatest achievement
🖤
I love his voice
This is how I imagine young Severus Snape
Okay but people don't see what's wrong with the part I can lure any women into bed I want mothers better lock your doors and hide your daughters cause im insane??
Woah
Aqui é do Brasil não te conhecia onde vc se escondia ?, clipe lindo, voz maravilhosa sem palavras HOMEM LINDO DA PORRA, Letras das musicas maravilhosas cristo e os berros, tadinhos dos meus vizinhos kkkkk vão te ouvir até kkkkk, ouvi muitas vezes.
We need Goodbye Graceful or Dont Mess With Oujia Boards next
Should be in the new resident evil
So fking good!
The voice range Ronnie has is incredible
This should be an official Castlevania soundtrack.
Would love to see them live and start with the original version and encore with this version!
i cry dude
This man can do anything! Hes skills are beyond the best
Say anything u want about Ronnie I met him once and my kids love all his music. Dudes got a line to my soul like Eminem a song for every mood and emotion I have ever been through!
Okay I'm sold give us the album now already 🥺
i got fucking goosebumps😻
Is that Paige from wwe?
Holy shit I love this fucken song
The singer is very talented but lyrics not so much.
Deng good
Palaye Royale: Makes a Music from the same location 3 months ago Ronnie: YOuRe cOpYInG Me
I love him for doing these remakes! The originals are great but these just show off how good he is at singing! And you can really hear that emotion ❤ #perfection
why is this so funny to me
This song really reminds me of the Used
why does he like aro from twilight
This is actually amazing...
hi 👋 my name 📛 is 🥺 runny ‼️im an attic 😜 daddy🐓 shouldve 🏃🏻never 🙊 raised 🔝 me ☝️😧on laxatives😡‼️
I come back and watch this vid once a week since its release. The vocal range, the misdirection, the new melodies and structure...Just incredible.
Okay but why tf he looks like a cute chick
this is a master piece 👏
Kinda forgot about this song for a while, and now I come back and it's not as beautiful as the day I lost it.  It's way, WAY better. I didn't even know it was possible, like damn.
Man ...You add this to if they decided to remake the Ann Rice Books into movies ...I can see Lestat singing this song ..can't you?
Love this good to see Saraya Jade in this to.
This gave me Dark Shadows vibes...I fucking love it
Not at the same level as The drug in me is reimagined... still absolutely brilliant tho.
hi my name is Ronnie!!! 😂😂😬😇😂😂😬😇😂😂😬😇 I'm an addict🙋😂😂😬😇
Somehow this is better then the original and im here for it!!! omg!!
Music is great but can't get over the girls lip injection jeesus, puts me off.
This is the first song I have heard from them. J'adore !!!
yes you are!
The best part of the song 2.40-2.53
hi my name is runny i’m an attic
It would be funny as shit if they made a remake of Bad Girls Club
Hino🥰🥰🥰🥰
Literally heard of these guys like three days ago and I’ve replayed this song over 100 times 🤷🏼‍♀️ I have soo much catching up to do.
Vaya voz tienes Ronnie, nunca dejas de sorprendernos
I'm not a Vampire is my favorite song by FIR but this- this is beautiful omg. They made it legendary shit- my 2021 was just saved by this
Love you! And mega nice video!
Paige! Wow...so cool
Omg so perfect. And it would be so nice, if he and tobias from avantasia could work together. that would be so great
SARAYA JADE IS AMAZING ! ♥
I'm honestly so happy to see you and Paige still together. When y'all initially got together there were so many nay-sayers who said it would be over asap, but seeing you 2 together just felt different for me and I disagreed. I wish you many more years of happiness together <33.
All the emotions I just had .. the chills that went through my body.. OMG. JUST WOW!  ♡
HELLO CAN SOMEONE PLS SEE THE AMOUNT OF MAKE UP AND FUCKING SKILLS TO COVER RONNIES BODY... ALL HIS TATTOS ARE GONE .... SOOOOOOOOOO GOOD.. AWESOME WORK!
I LOVE THIS SO FUCKING MUCH OMG
your vocal growth over the years is amazing 👏 I love you more now then in 2008!
whoever lent ronnie an anne rice book then thanks
But is this the same house as in Palaye Royale's Tonight is the night I die??
A masterpiece. Everyday, every second I listen to this song, wherever I am, whatever I am doing, I keep listening to this song. It hit's so deep. It frees some borders by acknowledging them, going deeper and just screaming "it's fucking ok, it is this way". I can't describe this power. It is just fucking awesome ♥
A masterpiece. I'm shocked... now I can't decide which version of this song is better 🙈🖤
Ok, but this Is more intense than all the Twilight Saga thogeter
This is just a pure masterpiece.
have u played curse of strahd recently ?
i love you so much ronnie i'm fucking sobbing this is is so beatiful
Ronnie is the best god damn looking vampire I ever witness... and this music video is a masterpiece. Ronnie's voice is a delight, as always OMG !!! THIS is epic !
This song is an absolute masterpiece. I’ve never heard such anything so incredible and so perfectly composed in my life. To top it off, it’s the greatest produced music video I’ve ever seen.
I love
RONBON THIS SMACKIN YUM 😩🙌
Still Emo's not Dead 🖤
this song sucks.
This is so good. Also just realized we need a Falling in Reverse theater live play
Ronnie in this style of singing, feat Ozzy?
Tattooless Ronnie looks so weird haha
You just keep amazing me. these remakes of your old songs are stunning and beautiful.
You know you have good taste when your 3 year old asks to see this video on repeat and have a tantrum if you don't play it
I really appreciate him making this much more dramatic it gives me chills
wt...is this a movie?
I feel  Power in your voice 👍👍;
Cool, very strange ... A Vampiric opera ... Very cool .. I loved it
Now I want to see a remake of "Good Girls Bad Guys". If he can transform that playful sassy song into an intense masterpiece like this, there will be no stopping him. He will rule the world.
For the love of GOD OMG YES ! 😍😍😍😍 My bf bashes FIR but even this had his jaw oooooo the damn floor 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼 this was fucking awesome
i literally cant stop listening to this. at least 3 times a day. when i wake up, go to bed, to and from work, at work, playing games, i cant escape it. too good.
I actually almost cried watching this. The music is so good but the Mv Is literally like a movie and I can feel what Dracula feels because of how Ronnie portrays it and sings it. He’s really born to sing and perform. I love him so much ever since escape the fate till now.
Great Song to Inspire People to Donate Blood.....
Wow... Amazing....absolutely beautiful!! @FallinginReverse
I was expecting this to be kinda stupid based off the title but damn was I wrong wtaf
Top
Paige looks very beautiful in this music video.  This song is awesome!!!!!!! I love the tone of it!!!!
This shit is fucking art 🍻🔥🔥🔥
Wow I was blown away 🤯🤩
It’s weird not seeing tattoos on Ronnie lol
A masterpiece
“Dracula: The Musical”  Zack Snyder Cut
Yooooo! This fucking SLAPS!
I really wish they hadn’t added the vocal effect when he said “Hi my name is Ronnie, I’m an addict”
So much better than twilight
Это просто восхитительно. У меня нет слов...
Reminds me of the song "House Carpenter" by Hurt
Шедевр
THIS IS FUCKING CRAZY!
I just want to hear what these geniuses can do with the ‘Ouija board’
"So I sharpen my teeth cause I love the way it feels when I sink into your skin and draw the ONLY thing that's real." There's nothing more real in life than our own blood. It does not pretend, it is not fake and without it, we cannot enjoy the wonders of life. Well written Ronnie.
😚☺😎😍
Oh he really needs to make this an hour and a half long 😍
4:57 EPIC
Way better love story than twilight
Am I the only one that thinks Ronnie looks kinda like Davey Havok here??
HI MY NAME IS RUNNY. 😳🦶 IM AN ATTIC. 😔 😿AND DADDY SHOULD HAVE NEVER RAISED ME ON LAXATIVES 😫💩💦
ⱧŁ ₥Ɏ ₦₳₥Ɇ Ł₴ ⱤØ₦₦Ɏ 🥺 𝙄'𝙢 𝙖𝙣 𝙖𝙩𝙩𝙞𝙘 😐
REimagined and REvamped.. i do realy like them..i hope there's still another ''RE" in the future.
oh god 😭 hi my name is ronnie i’m an addict *😔😔😫😫😣😣*
I liked his music before but when he's singing like this and slowing things down its beautiful. Its more meaningful and powerful this way. Plus the look he has going on in this video is amazing
💀  There's just no words. Legit only chills and tears, everytime. I'm shook.  Ronnie did it again, a MASTERPIECE. I shouldn't be surprised, never fails to amaze and even top himself. I've watched this everyday, at least once if not multiple times, just bravo dude 👏👏🖤
Paige is as beautiful as ever..
Aquí en México tienes MILLLONES de fans que matarían por estar en un concierto tuyo. Here in  mexico you have MILLIONS of fans that can kill just to be in a concert of you.  Congratulations for you ronnie, you are my idol and my example to follow
Page looks hot as ever
OMG....... Es hermoso
Can i tap "like" million times? Hi from Russia=)

Как всегда, на высоте. Люблю Вас 🖤

I think when you show your voice like in this song your voice is greater than all other ones!  I love your musik and it heals my heard from brokenness! Ronny you are amazing and definitiv the best Musiker ever! 🥰🥰🥰 my daughter (6) loves your songs too. When its over she says..mummy turn it on again I love it. 🤣🤣🤣

For the longest time I thought he said he was luring women into his VAN! Bed sounds much better
R.I.P Derek Jones 🥺💞
Quem é que da deslike numa obra de arte dessas?
This is ledgend. Love it😀😍
O High Ronnie, High its He, I AM...  Great work and vocal projection. I wonder if they got the message.... good thing you did this Art for us all.... I hope I get a chance to work with you.... I have to chill for various reasons... Soon they will let me do my music. If not, I'll do my music and sing to myself.... I appreciate your cinematic expression and artistry. I have been following your art basically since the beginning of your career.. I see the artist in you and I see it in me as well... There aren't many whom can do what we do at this level.... Keep shaping their hearts and minds....  On another note, Endure until  the end, Soon all the truth will be out... Even if I have to die for it to come out.... I will not die though because I AM HE... they cant stop the fire that has been set amongst the people.    I AM Here for you all...  Soon people will see, though some will miss the boat... not everyone will embrace the light and the darkness and overstand them equally, within and without themselves.... as above so below.   I wish you so much love and abundance... I Hope you flourish and grow too do many more amazing Crafting of beautiful artistry.   Your Ronnie and I AM Aaron Look up the name etomology for both and compare them.... Kinda strange.... I know this was ment to happen.   ❤🧡💛💚💙💜🤴👁👼

Нет слов! Даже не знаю, как описать, какое сильное  впечатление произвела на меня эта песня! В конце так вообще разрыдалась! Ронни, браво!
Fucking Legend..
Hi 👋👋 my name 😐is runny 💩💩💩 I’m an attic 💔😭⛓🖤daddy 💔💔should have never 😩raised me on laxatives 💊💩💊💩💊
Paige🔥🔥🔥
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Today I realised that the woman in the video,actually is Paige.
Ronnie that was amazing. What a fucking comeback!
Sick video haha 👍🏻
DEREK JONES master of guitar for ever
Dude you made my day... unbelievable...😻😻😻👍👍👍👍🤗🤗🤗
As someone who just randomly stumbled upon this video, artist, and genre....I like it, but have no idea what it is. The only point of reference I may have is Evanescence, because I’m getting heavy Amy Lee vibes from this, piano and all.
... the guitar is silent in this one.
"IN LOVING MEMORY OF DEREK JONES" 😭😭
Fucking beautiful song. Love the revamped version more honestly
LESTAT? IS THAT YOU?!
I'm gonna tell my kids this was Twilight
I love that they revamped this is amazing and hits the soul hard falling for life!
buenardo
Can Falling In Reverse please make a full album of songs like this!
PERFEIÇÃOOOOO!! 🌙💖💖💖💖💖
это просто невероятно
Is that his wife paige? I think shes prettier than all the other females that have been in his vids.  As a crazy Sagittarius myself we need a person who can basically for lack of a better phrase ride or die thru our ups n downs. ♐♐♐
Ronnie’s voice is so amazing
😟 Hell 𝕐𝔼𝕊
I love this song it is very powerful I feel for the band losing a member is never fun he is in a better place and will always be remembered
Omg the way they conceal ronnie’s face tattoos
Revamped (nice) omg this is amazing 👏   what power and emotion in Ronnie's voice. The video deserves to win awards too what a masterpiece, I really hope the guys keep reworking songs like this and drug in me because I know I'm not the only one absolutely loving it
Song of the year!
2:38 here's the part for the tik tok 😻😻
Just Awesome 💙💯
This is not a song, this is an experience!
It's a crime this wasn't recommended to me sooner what the FUCK
Every freaking single time I  listing to this song I have tears in my eyes, holy shit this is perfection. What a performance Ronnie! 🔥🔥🔥
is it just me or should ronnie radke make a movie and this needs to be in it
👍👍👍
Ronnie looks awesome, but the girl is an emotionless mask
Fucking amazing.. masterpiece
Anne Rice would have a panic attack
Some heavy interview with a vampire influences here, one of my favorite videos easily....wish I could pull off that look. He should be in the remake they are doing, which will probably be horrible but I hope not.
The song is called 'I'm Not A Vampire' but...in the video he is a vampire. *hits bong* ...holy shit.
Jesus someone's been bored over quarantine
Get Amy Lee on this and muah! masterpiece.
My hearth is broken
This is insane 😍
Dude..whoa
God damn it I love these Rock Opera remakes by Ronnie, absolutely fucking beautiful and amazing. Said if before, even though just discovered Falling in Reverse, Ronnie is a musical, lyrical, and vocal genius. Besides all all that look at the theatrics of this video. Next should be Falling in Reverse presents, whatever fucking movie they wanna make.
New album when?
1:28   The emotions are hitting me...
That last part was intense
This man gets prettier with time it's mind blowing
No matter how many times I've watched this video or listened to the song it makes me emotional and get teary every time but I'm so addicted to it. Words can't express how excited I am for the concert!!! <3
😂
The amount of appreciation and love i feel for ronnie radke and the amazing music he creates is beyond everything!❤❤ this video i stared at with aww and i couldnt look away! The added music and the storyline for this, it was all so beautiful
Mano maravilho, não só a musica mais a evolução musical deles, slk de arrepiar
holy shit!
This is falling in reverse and I fucking love it  Remastered (all) from etf PLEASE DO APOCALYPSE NEXT
amo este tema si alguien le interesa ver mi reacción es español https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwQHzH2UIik
I'm gonna eat this for breakfast, lunch, dinner. This is the best meal of the day. So delicious.
BRUTAL
Fuck I am loving these reimagines/revamps!!!! !!
Omg 🖤
This is a Masterpiece y'all 🔥🔥🔥
I love this so much😍
amazing
Dude I’m pissed that this shit pops off a little 😂😂 lmao
Mano, que obra de arte não consigo parar de ouvir
So happy to finally see paige in a video
So Cliché
That so "god bless all of you now" was just chilling
MY JAW DROPPED WOW
speechless
Its like 50x on repeat today! I had to watch it more than once cause my phone has crappy tones. But on ear budd it's beyond amazing! Gives me goose bumps!!!!
So intense and so much emotion. Im speechless. This gives off serious Interview With A Vampire vibes.. so Ronnie are you saying youre a Werewolf Vampire Hybrid??? This gives me goosebumps and everytime the scene comes up with Paige in the bathtub I start crying, I can feel the emotion in his voice, in my soul. Ronnie you are a genius, and a musical God. Cant wait to see what you do next.
2:40 hi my name is ronnie im an addict and my daddy shouldve never raised me on laxitives
This is so beautiful. These vibes are real
Oh my emo heart! YES, just yes
ronnie i fucking love you bro. this is amazing.
Anyone else get a A7X vibe with this one? More specifically,  some of it reminded me of "A little piece of heaven". Mostly different and also epic. Ronnie has a significantly stronger vocal range   Anyways, brilliant song and video Ronnie. Pure Genius
youve brought this music back to LIFE with these new renditions. Brought me back to my old days
holyyyy fffffffffffff ily ily ily ily ily ily
So who’s gonna explain the videoclip?
this version of ronnie brings back the hard crush I had on him so bad.............
raised by the wolves (Rehowled)?
Esta potente 🕳️👅🕳️
?
how about Alone or Coming Home?
this shit never fails to amaze me HFBDBF
This is crap, I would never consider this rock n roll ,it's pop stop trying to say it's anything but
Please check out our new single "Afraid Of The World". Available everywhere now! https://youtu.be/y2P6vtEUnDw
Beautiful, thank you for another amazing release!!! Absolutely amazing!! Left me wanting more again, always a great thing!!!
His music never fails to slap hes aesthetic his voice him exsiting makes me glad im still here thx for alway makin my day🖤
This is the most epic & iconic revamping ever!!!! The composition of the vox are incredible!!!
😍
daily reminder that dixies song about being "really really really really sad" has more streams/views than this masterpiece
Incredible masterpiece. Goosebumps from head to heart!!
This is terrible lol 😂
loki singing lol
*nods enthusiasticly*
Playboi carti the real vamp >
And whiskey seems to be my holy water, and mothers better lock your doors and hide your daughters ! Fucking legend Ronnie
WOAH MASTERPIECE REVAMPED
How have I never heard of this guy before?? I rarely listen to songs with vocals, but can't stop listening to this. Insane, absolutely love it, beautiful song and visuals. <3  Also, "reVAMP" hehe.
Черт, это божественно. Конец песни просто бесподобен, просто до слез, реально. Ронни как всегда, на высоте
ronnie is a fucking musical genius i swear
I would love to hear Ronnies version of I miss you by blink this video kina reminds me of it
Reminds me of interview with a vampire when loui turns
well cradle of filth is the shit to go with ... this feels like vampire pop song :D not bad 3 / 10
Rest In Peace Derek
Ronnie you can make a version in Spanish of your music.....
Please ronnie version in Spanish of this song
Incredible.
Like, I like it and all. But for a "remade" song I think it could be better/different than this. Idk, I was expecting something different when i went to click on this.🤷
Wow
I can’t stop replaying the part where he says “Hi, my name is Ronnie, I’m an addict.”
I just rewatched the old video and I would like to thank RR for showing me you can come back from a dark place. Loved your music then love your music even more now
ronnie radke do be looking like Snape from harry potter
Fuck it I’ll say it.... I cried watching this it was powerfully beautiful
Dammnnnn! Love this version!🔥🖤
please remake all your songs  i love the old and the remakes they are so different but i love them both, your music changed but i love the new music too! keep it up
To me the last 1.5 minutes of the song is where Ronnie shows his love-loss-appreciation of his friend that passed derek jones, showing his Vulnarabiility, its amazing to see the original vs the version where ronnie just belts outs the feels
Man this is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥  all the reimagined songs are just top notch. Such a great spin on the originals.  My question is just how is Ronnie so good at everything?  Must be taking vocal roids 😂
I have watched several reviews and such, @thethirdearnest compared Ronnie to Chester and I respect that and agree but in his own respects watching Ronnie talk about the writing things he wishes he had done things he did do I would almost actually say Ronnie is up there in the composition levels of Beethoven. The understanding he has of adding different layers, the Octive changes the theatricals! I one hundred percent think Ronnie is not talked about enough for his talent
Where has this song been my entire life. Thank you for bringing this work of art into existence.
Who's the model?
Ok PRODUCTION value I see you. Ronnie out here makin full ass movies now im here for it.
Listen to symphonic metal instead. Kamelot, nightwish, mago de Oz, etc..
I liked before I even heard it I know its gonna be good
I'm not too sure on this one....
Absolutely beautiful music video. Im extremely impressed that Ronnie is just nailing everything he does.
Okay but how did he really make the lyric “I feel like a lady that is pregnant with a baby cause I’m always throwing up”  work with the vibe of this song
This is a masterpiece.
2:40
Not me crying over a music video ;-;
nossa que brega amei
pika
That was the most dramatic thing I’ve ever seen 😯👏👏
2:40 for personal reasons
Vampire ronnie 😍😍
this is beautiful 0mfg
I admit im 2 weeks late but this is the best birthday present ever! Ronnie thank you!  You are one of a kind! Much much love from the canary islands! Dam I wish i could say more ! WOW
idk what is more masterpiece if the song or the video
THIS IS A MASTERPIECE!!!!!!
I like this one better than the original and i loved the original
I love this smh wasn't trying to tear up !! Thanks 😭😂
That's just amazing
People: Rock is just noise with no music Falling in reverse: Oh yeah?)
Addiction ; The Musical. 🐺🐰
Oh, please tell me you’re gonna make a doc on how this masterpiece was created! This video Rembrandt. Everyone has been waiting for the Jesus fellow to appear but this is production is what gives me hope for humanity, a true miracle of a creation, ha. Bravo!
mAh boy is a well grown goth adult now
До мурашек
Hermoso!!! ❤️
This is by far the best thing iv ever seen wow just wow goosebumps not the word 😳😳😳🖤🤟
Ronnie without tattoos feels off
Thank you so much for listening to us and giving us this beautiful rendition. 🖤🖤😍😍 I cannot stop listening and watching this brutaful song! I love you Ronnie, and FIR!
Masterpiece truly an epic song!
Ronnie..... My god...... What a masterpiece!!!! Never Stop, like never ever! Please oh god please, make more songs like this! I didn't listen to your music 10 years ago, but your new YOU is just amayzing! Lost for words!
just wow
Awesome 👍👍
i thought this was a cover. the dramaticness paired with the extremely cheesy lyrics are so good.
Even this cant bring the old times back to life, its nice to mix everything, im a big fan of ronnie since e.t.f but this kind of set up is not clicking to me alesana make this kind of stuff and their good at this but ronnie making himself a joke now with this type of style, i rather listen to dot dot curve again lol
I love this song 😍
Wth ..2.2 million view only.should be 220 million
Omg when "in loving memory of derek jones" appeared i started crying 😭💔 such a good video though
"Эпичненько". По моему хорошая, качественная и жирная точка в тренде на вампиров.
Hi 🥺 my name is runny 💩 I’m an attic 💀 daddy 🥵  should of never raised me on laxatives 😳✋🏻
Speechless
оxуенно
Ok where do I start!!! My soon to be 18 yr old daughter had me listen to it last night.. I'm already in love with Ronnie Radke,  but this song made me love him a ton more!!! Fantastic job Falling in reverse!!! That shit is 100% total AWESOMENESS 💯🔥🤘❤💯🔥🤘❤💯🔥🤘❤💯🔥🤘❤💯💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥❤❤❤❤❤🤘🤘🤘🤘
Meisterwerk 🖤
Ron is the most versatile musician.
my favorite lesbian singer <3
Fkn outstanding ronnie❤️ gorgeous bruh
lol whos here still listening in 2021
Just when I thought he couldn't get a song harder to sing that the drug in me is reimagined. He is just a master in his own art.
am i the only one who thinks a mashup of this and Lay All Your Love On Me by Abba would be absolute fire?
If this doesn't get the man the respect he deserves from the music industry IDFK what will🤷🏼‍♂️ half of the artists today can't even compare to Ronnie!! 💯 Ronnie is his own genre and all the hate he gets is because of  his ability to hit every single end of the musical spectrum and be an incredible songwriter on top of that💪 From what he's gone through in his life and had to bouce back from, it makes it even more meaningful to his fans that can relate to his story.
Song's good but clothes aren't historically accurate. Woman wouldn't wear their corsets on their skin. They would have a nightgown like clothing underneath the corset.
Reminds me of Dark shadow movie.
Wow this gives a big Dark Shadows vibe
Que homem Que talento Que clipe Que musica Que obra de arte
Fucking love ya Ronnie. These slowed down versions remind me of playing the old Organ you had writing cheesy stuff and then playing it at church youth groups. trying to pick up girls..
Somehow you topped the iconic original. Love it
This is an exceptional song and video.  This band has gone to another level since I listened to Coming Home in 2017, and I just now found out tonight!
This song is about rehab not actually being a vampire, Ronnie stick to your roots please
Brilliant. I've had this on repeat for 3 days now lol. Beautiful
Omg this is beautiful !!!
MY FAVORITE BAND! JUST GOT MY 🎟 FOR INTO THE UNKNOWN!!!😎🌹🤘
So I just realized this today people. Ronnie will never be able to do a re imagined version of Not good enough for truth in cliche. 🤯 what a sad, sick world we live in.
Nosa q viage
The narrative quality of this video is incredible 🙏
This is fucking sick
theres a pun there revamped XUX
This is amazing. I love the original but damn this one hits in an entirely different way.
Song would have been killer in vampire diaries
Such good production wow
Omg!! 😱😱😱😍😍😍😍
This MASTERPIECE  reminds me of the video for meatloafs I'd do anything for love... Her dress, the covered furniture, the atmosphere... And I just love Ronnie even more for the reference😱Anyone else?
100% definitely a better love story than Twilight. Fucking amazing job.
Would this be considered American Visual Kei?
Damn ❤️
I'm just gonna say, if Ronnie were a vampire, he'd be a day-walker.
He looks like Davey from AFI 15 years ago...
the best i’ve heard. it just blew my mind
Love seeing Paige💜
The intro is reminds me of everybody's fool by Evanescence and hurricane by 30sec to Mars lol
sh*tty gay power metal
hi 👋 my name 📛 is 🥺 runny ‼️im an attic 😜 daddy🐓 shouldve 🏃🏻never 🙊 raised 🔝 me ☝️😧on laxatives😡‼️
i see why people like this version but the old one just excels in every way
If you're *falling in reverse,* are you flying?  ...... PS, beautiful vocals & aesthetics!
When their contract comes up, give these people whatever the hell they ask. Ronnie is a god damn demented genius and this is as close as modern music will get to perfection. I loved the original song, this takes the original and multiples it by a thousand.
Queue 50 videos showing up in your youtube recommended "Vocal instructor reacts..."
A message to Ronnie:  Can you please give credit to the composer of the composition, and orchestration of this track: Sean Rooney from Dublin wrote all of it, as he did for ,"The Drug In Me Is Reimagined." Please, please give credit where it is due.
@3:23 doesn't get any better than this!
this man and his re orchestrations of my angst are going to be the reason i have a heart attack.
Love this song
Anyone think he'll redo good girls bad guys? If so how do you think he'd do it lol
Es tan raro que me lo recomendara en pleno examen donde tenia una iper tensión, pero me encanto. Lo andaré escuchando hasta saber de mi calificación.
Hella cool
It’s so much crazier once you realise that the girl is paige from WWE
Vlad from Magicka would love this song!
2:40 the layered vocals here awoken part of my brain i never knew existed. I fucking love this song!
Woah... it kept getting better, even when I was already living and dying for it 😱
Kinda funny If  Re... Version may represent his past life ,a Vampire And OG Version is his future ,a Werewolf
It just kept getting better and better! My jaw dropped so many times throughout! I didn't think I could love something more than the original but here I am! Incedible !!
His acting was fantastic 🖤🖤🖤🦇🩸
Низкий поклон вам за этот шедевр парни  👍👍👍
OMG I love the video and the song, and Ronnie looks so good as a vampire
Alv, la morra es Paige de wwe? ._.
Gaga tick tack?
SHET 🔥
Damn, I can't believe I missed 3 weeks of knowing this song was out!
Damnnn what a production!
Блять рони ты крут то что у вас с музыкой сейчас происходит это ваще топ....
Original is much more fun.
God I'm glad I'm bisexual
Just gunna say it outright. I fucking love this new remastered thing. Almost more than the originals. Possibly so. Lets just say fucking legend Ronnie.
this is shite where is the fast paced energy
shoulda called it "revampired"
Wow it’s amazing 😍😍
so this is how ronnie looks like without the tattoos
I don't even have the words to describe how I'm feeling, with what you're doing to these songs. You're a unicorn in the music world my dude. Keep it the fuck up.
Hey my name is Ronnie I'm an attic
I NEVER LIKED FALLING IN REVERSE BUT NOW YOU ARE PULLING AT MY LITTLE DARK HEARTSTRINGS AND I'M UNDEAD FOR THESE MAGNIFICENT VIDEOS. ...ugh love it. That is all.
OHMYGODDDDDDD
Bros just a gamer tryna go pro
He's giving such Lestat de Lioncourt vibes here and I'm here for it 🤘 except for Luoie 🖤
BRUH, compare these vocals to "Not good enough For Truth in Cliche". The glow up is almost inconceivable
So, in facts this is the best version =) most better than original.
This is so damn emotional, I'm so in love with this masterpiece...
Кто после Hellscream? =)
Ronnie to Epitaph: bares fangs "look at me. I'm Epitaph now"
No, Vlad, you won't fool us!
Wow!
The amount of times I've listened to this song this WEEK.... It's just a little crazy. 😂
Amazing!  Ronnie is truly a master of his craft.  Greatest music video I've ever seen.
Me gustaría poder dejar más de un like; tremenda producción! Sin palabras
hard to judge this one , i like the up beat poppy one more i think but fucking great work all the same
THAT WAS AWESOMEEEEEEE ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Didn’t quite nail it compared to drug in me and you reimagine
Auto tune when he is the last person who really needs it
I’m low key in love with this remake
Dude I get a feeling that a new trilogy is coming together. Could be reading to much into it but with the Drug In Me Is You Reimagined and now this song. 🤔
This song, the video, his voice and screams, WOW. I love this song but you did amazing to almost give it a whole new feel. Great Job! This is so good!!
All of y’all’s music videos are amazing! Like watching a movie, I love it!
Such a better love story than twilight.
Este hombre no es de este mundo, gracias por revivir momentos
You're the real life V from Devil May Cry
Ronnie's vocal skills are on another fucking level. His earlier songs are cool; but these remasters or "revamped" songs, resonate. Whether he thinks it's cringey. I'm like no dude, this shit hits the soul. The way he go from a belt, to a falsetto and the full on belt. Dude talent...
CARALHO Q PERFEIÇÃO, cadê as mana que escreve fanfic p ver isso??
i don't remember this part of the vampire diaries
THIS GOES A LITTLE TO HARD
I just can't stop hearing that song ! This is so perfect !
well u sure did change it thats for sure
hi my name is runny... 🥺🥀 im an attic 🤕💔 and daddy shouldve never raised me on laz AHH tives 😭‼️
New music please! Not old songs redone
I would kill to see this live!!
Ronnie Radke is a gorgeous human being 😍
Better love story than Twilight
Absolutely beautiful work
Wow!
Praying for an a album with this concept...
bjdjjdsiisisis this is so good what-
This was more then just a song. This was a musical symphony that deserves a Grammy! And that’s just talking about the music, the video was a drama on par with Phantom of the Opera. Ronnie, whatever you do, please don’t stop here!
I swear his voice is a helluva lot more powerful than it used to be
This is awesome it's like a rock opera
BRO SHE LOOKS LIKE PAIGE FROM WWE Edit: OMFG IT IS! I am stupid, I apologize
No me arrepiento de haber visto y escuchado esta porquería, pues así regrese al tema original y fue un placer.
everything about this is fucking sick. i know it's so cliché to say that a ballad by a rock band is my favorite, but this one really is my favorite of all fir songs. the vocals are so fucking beautiful and so is the video, and the story behind it really gives me chills. the orchestra in the background is absolutely incredible, and the construction of all the instruments etc. i can not listen to this song without going into a deep state of mind. it sounds way too good to be made by humans... or vampires... - while listening to the last half of the song, i always find myself just staring out in the thin air while questioning my whole existence lol. my favorite part is "hi my name is ronnie, im an addict". idk why, it just hits me hard - the way the vocals are layered and stuff. i also REALLY love the "i just want the world to bleed". AHHH!! the whole vampire theme is so so sick and so well showcased. this song IS SUCH A FUCKING MASTERPIECE, and i hope it'll be in history books in the future. this is what i want the future to remember!! i thought nothing could get better than 'the drug in me is reimagined', but oh my god i was wrong. it will forever be in my heart, i have literally never been so amazed and struck by a song before. i can never ever begin to describe how mesmerised i am by the band, and especially ronnie's talent. i also just want to add that paige is so fucking beautiful, wow. I LOVE YOU GUYS THANK YOU FOR THIS MASTERPIECE!
Why did he do this I can't
I remember when it was 2013 and I listened to this song while I was getting ready for school, until one day they stopped uploading music like before ... I miss those days
Damn how just how is he is this amazing wowoww👏👏👏👏💞💞😱😱😱💋💋💋👍👍👍💗💗💖💖😵😵😵😵😵
I didn't know I needed this version in my life
Definitely didn't cry like a little b*tch listening to this song, definitely didn't fangirl at Ronnie's vampire aesthetique and flawless face. This guy is a gift from God, and I am thankful I live in the same moment in the world's history as him. This song is so beautiful, it legit makes my heart HURT.
This is really better than the original
Since 2004 i'm crazy about your voice. I'm happy that you finally make a song like this, where you can highlight it while keeping that dark style. Love you
Everybody:Ronnie, you do not make better song than Popular Monster Ronnie:Hold my whisky
Emo didn't die... it matured...
I'm getting serious Dark Shadows vibes!! What a masterpiece
Damn This things should be at 450-500 Million views.
Patiently awaiting the entirety of this musical. Chills
The river of My Chemical Romance has been replenished. The hole I need in my heart is now full And Ronnie makes me smile in that slow way I so enjoy. I bleed and fall down with it's pull, and yet the pain becomes so beautiful, when Ronnie smashes my sad little skull.
amazing! it reminds me of ice nine kills too
Forced rework/remix/revamp wtevr Done it with drug in me, went well, doesnt have to do it again... just my opinion
Wow wow wow
Now we need Chemical Prisoner (Released)
b r o o o
The most beautiful thing I’ve ever heard. Your voice is heavenly !
me throughout the entire video : excuse me what the fUcK
YES OMG
100% coolest music video I’ve seen in forever
Ronnie needs to stop blessing my ears😩❤️‼️
2:40 😍HI 🖤MY 😈NAME 😳IS 💩💩💩RUNNY💩💩💩IM 🧛AN 💔ADDICT💊🥴
The talk stutter singing style got me rolling xD
My god this is so fucking good. Can’t wait to hear the other revisions!
This is so sick
I am in LOVE, this was incredible. I love this so much, I hope you do more reimagined or revamped songs, they're insane. "In loving memory of Derek Jones" Rest in peace you fucking legend
Of course paige is in it 😂
saraya looks so stunning!
saraya!!!! <333
Can you please remake " die for you"? If you see this and actually do it I'm probably going to die! I met you at the last warped tour in va Beach and I still remember every detail of that day. Nice work on this song!
Speed run I’m literally listening to this on repeat!!!
so damn good!
Best 6 minutes and 17 seconds of my life
2021 and emo is most certainly not dead.
Lyrics pls
This is absolutely beautiful!!!!! This is art!!!!!💜💜💜
It seems like he's really trying to not be an asshole anymore!  Anyone else love the long hair? He also looks so much younger! Idk if it's the tattoos or what!
Yo.
The world isn't ready for this!
The things Ronnie can do with his voice is Finominal!❤️
Another classic banger turned into a modern BANGER! I've literally been listening to this every day since it dropped! It is amazing! A total fucking masterpiece! I can not wait to see what you do next Ronnie! Continue making music the way you want to! I will always be here to support you no matter what! Stay safe and healthy love! Keep Rocking Out!!
Amamos
The party really gets going at 4:30 wow what a climax !!
the best i´ve heard for years ....
If this were a movie id definitely watch it👍
Does anyone know who the woman is. She's seems familiar to me, but I can't quite place where I've seen her before
The oringinal was fantastic and I played it alot back then, but this is just a masterpiece of art and music! really very well done!
Its my 100th time watching and listening, and I still get chills 😍😍
Wow this was beautiful the storyline was amazing!
A Fucking Masterpiece
Falling in Reverse? More like Aging in Reverse, Ronnie looks amazing still
I have Cancer now. Thanks Obama
Almost every second of this song had me with chills running through my entire body. This is without a doubt the most beautiful song FIR/Ronnie have ever done. The original is a good song and all, but... wow. Just wow.
Yes I would my Ronnie extra crispy
THIS IS SO BAD BAHAHAHAHAH
So derek committed?
One of the only musicals I would ever pay to go see.
so we just copying palaye royale now?
masterpiece approved
Paige looks absolutely stunning
Am I the only one that wants Ronnie to collab with someone? Like his voice is fire by it's self but mixed with another would be like woah
wasn’t this the plot of twilight?
Una verdadera obra de arte. En vez de un videoclip he podido ver una película en tan solo 6 minutos. Hermoso
This was fucking beautiful, I love it Ronnie!! Amazing job !!
That was filled with a lot of work
omg
2m!!!
2:40
Это Просто Нечто P.S. Это шедееееееееееееееееееееееееееееееевр
fans: wanted a reimagined version Ronnie: why do you think we are reimagining it two weeks later:
Master Piece
Someday, please, write a modern opera, Ronnie Lloyd Webber
so fooking perfect in any aspect omg!
FIRのバンドサウンドが緻密でかっけえからこそ、オーケストラでこんなにも壮大になってると思う。マジで好き。
I'm waiting for a new big movie to use this in their epic trailer
Bueno, no soy un vampiro,   pero me siento como uno   A veces duermo todo el día   porque odio la luz del sol   Mis manos siempre están temblando   El cuerpo siempre me duele,   y la oscuridad es cuando me alimento   Bueno,   puedo atraer cualquier mujer  que quiera en mi cama conmigo    Y el whisky parece ser   mi agua bendita   Y madres,   mejor cierren sus puertas   y escondan a sus hijas     Porque estoy loco   puedo sentirlo en mis huesos   Corriendo por mis venas,   ¿cuándo me volví tan frío?   Por el amor de Dios,   ¿dónde está mi autocontrol?   Si mi hogar es donde está mi corazón,   entonces mi corazón ha perdido toda esperanza     Bueno, no soy un zombi,   pero me siento como uno hoy   Comatoso autoinducido,   aturdimiento químico   Mi cabeza siempre está dando vueltas   por esta visión borrosa mareada   y mi estómago ha tenido suficiente   Me siento como una dama que está embarazada de un bebé   porque siempre estoy vomitando   Y hola , mi nombre es Ronnie, soy un adicto   y papá nunca debería haberme criado en Black Sabbath   Estoy loco, puedo sentirlo en mis huesos   Corriendo por mis venas,   ¿cuándo me volví tan frío?   Por el amor de Dios,   ¿dónde está mi autocontrol?   Si el hogar es donde está mi corazón,   entonces mi corazón ha perdido toda esperanza   ¿Cuándo creerán ustedes los mortales?   (No es un vampiro)   Solo quiero   que el mundo sangre   (No es un vampiro)   Lujuria al ver tu sangre  (No es un vampiro)   Lo juro por Dios,   no soy un—  (Él no es un—) ( Él no es un—)     Así que Dios los bendiga a todos ahora   porque voy directo al infierno   (Directo al infierno)   Y los llevaré conmigo   porque lo saben muy bien    Entonces afilo mis dientes   porque amo la forma en que se siente   cuando me hundo en tu piel   y dibujo lo único que es real.   No me crees,   ¿debería escribirlo con sangre?   Será mejor que conduzcas   esa puta estaca hasta mi corazón   y trates de correr  Hijo de puta, soy un vampiro  Y estoy loco, puedo sentirlo en mis huesos  Corriendo por mis venas,   ¿cuándo me he vuelto tan frío?  Por el amor de Dios,   ¿dónde está mi autocontrol?  Si mi hogar es donde está mi corazón,   entonces mi corazón ha perdido todo   El corazón   ha perdido todo    el corazón   ha perdido   toda esperanza  (ha perdido toda esperanza)  (ha perdido toda esperanza)  (ha perdido toda esperanza)  toda esperanza,   mi corazón ha perdido todo   esperanza....
Wow so cool
Ronnie did it again!!!
Makes me thing of dark Shadows with Johnny Depp.x
I literally got goose bumps from his vocal changes and tingles from the screaming. Cannot stress the amazing ranges he can pull off enough. I need to thank teenage past me for discovering him because adult me is crying.
This is better than vampire diaries😫💗
My ears and a heart weren’t prepared for this 🤯😍😭
Dark Shadow vibes
I love this
Oh boy haha the irony of the title 🤣🤣🤣 but in all honesty this is AMAZING ❤️❤️❤️ I love this song
Been watching this multiple times a day since it came out, Ronnie's musical and visual genius is on another level!
And Paige looks way better in this.    I dont really like her WWE look.   She's amazing in this tho.
My boi has LUNGS
Ronnie is truly the interpretation to what emotions are. He truly engulfs me more so into my emotions and just let go my pain that has been screaming to be let out from my heart for the world to hear.. so that one day we will realize how dark we become, and let go to become the light of hope and kindness once more.
Iv seen this like 30 times and I just caught a reference.  At the end when he walks out on the ledge and just belts.   So this song is about addiction    when you do that and have a fear of hights your grounded but feel like your falling.   That's literally exactly how you feel in withdrawal.  I havent seen anyone say that yet thats why I'm saying it
Im here thanks to a wrestling news channel that informed me Paige was in this video. At 35 years of age I've watched several pale white dudes with black hair do this whole thing, so I wont knock it...but only because I found myself actually starting to like it a bit even though the look and style is old as fuck.
Ronnie has gone from a lead front man to an epic artist. This song is a masterpiece. I can see a rock opera coming to a venue near you.
I've been a fan of Ronnie's for years and I can relate to what this song really means.
I love Ronnie so much! I have to basically force myself to stop listening to him because I know I'll never have him.
This gives me phantom of the opera goes vampiric vibes 😍
What's next from him rock metal rap county and techno all in one song
Okay but his voice is amazing
ronnie is a pretty boy as a vamp
But I am a vampire 🧛‍♂️
Ronnie. I know you hear it all the time, but you're a genius. Thanks for the music and the videos!
Damn my bois still alive
FIR please make a whole album of this!!  🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤 PLEASE!!!
Whole body chills. So raw and beautiful.
Two million views so far, KEEP GOING!
I'm getting full body goosebumps. I REPEAT!! FULL BODY GOOSEBUMPS!!!
Ronnie Fucking Radke with the home run !!!!!! 🤘🏼♥️💯👑
Rest In Peace, Derek
Bravo Bravo!!!👏👏👏
Why is Ronnie such an underrated talent... the fucking arrangement of this song is chilling
Nah de locos 😔💕
I’m so proud of Ronnie
More tingles than asmr
Okay, can they just make this "Reimagined" stuff into a stage play or a movie? This could definitely be the next musical cult movie. What are you waiting for. , Tim Burton?
IT'S THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SONG I'VE EVER HEARD
Just perfect
I need to see him in a movie❤ classic like this is amazing❤😭
Has anybody else noticed how great his voice has been sounding the past few years? (He's always had a great voice but it just sounds like he's really been working on it) It sounds so much more powerful and smooth than it used to. This is such a vocal piece of art
These remakes hit different now ngl
Vampire Ronnie can bite me any time he wants
Ронни вырос в моих глазах как артист .великолепная песня и его вокал стал очень крутым !!!!!
literally screaming in my car listening to this. its amazing Ronnie, congrats. 😊
This was way beautiful and I enjoyed this much better than the original. ❤️
Yo veía algo raro en Ronnie cuando vi el video... HASTA AHORA VEO QUE TIENE LOS TATUAJES CUBIERTOS, me siento tan estúpida aynoapenasmedicuenta.
Dude how big of a budget was this music video! Lol!
this is so god damn good
“Ronnie seems distant” Nah he’s just creating another masterpiece
Это шедевр, не могу поверить, что есть люди, кто в наше время делают такие вещи, а не слушают беканье моргерштерма
Both the song and video are amazing but could someone please explain the narrative of the video for me?
snape from harrry potter??
People can hate Ronnie, they can hate his music, but you can't hate his talent. masterpiece!
What a phenomenal performance
Why so sad?
2 MILLION VIEWS IN 2 WEEKS. :'3 🖤✨
The drug in me is reimagined and I’m not a vampire revamped are pure master pieces I cannot stop listening to them and watching the videos
Hey Ronnie radke I love falling in reverse just to let you know
Oh my.. That goosebumps hits me hard.. Love this version more than the first.
Bruh this is fucking crazy...I love it
Wow, that was epic
I hope we get caught like a fly !
I... I just got goosebumps all over my body... It's just perfect and hit me on a higher level... OmG!
After seeing The Drug in Me reimagined, I was soooo hoping he would do I'm not a Vampire as well and I waited soooo long and was NOT disappointed. Ronnie as a vampire....I have no words <3
This is breathtaking.
Beautiful song and imagery. Also, HOLY SHIT! That's WWE superstar Paige. Cool. :)  Edit: I just found out they're dating. Lmao
Kkkkkkkk A melhor desde que deixou o ETF
5:34 Oooh the Goosebumps are real!
Love this new sound the songs have.
The drug in me, Popular Monster, now this...another Masterpiece... incredible voice, range...power, and the passion, the classic line " maybe Daddy shouldn't have raised me on Black Sabbath"...and whiskey is my holy water...😈, well done brother...well done...I know you miss your boy 🎸, but he wants you to keep giving us these treasures..keep it up, in these horrible times. Thank you, thank you, thank you !!!!
1 word * GOOOSEEEEEBUMPS* and EPIC ok 2 words.

♡ This song playing for 2 days strait in the background of my house. RONNIE RADKE is brilliant I just don't think he realized it until now ✌
fucking genius
I love that Ronnie is so versatile w his music, this is a fucking masterpiece and I’ve listened to it at least 300 times
I’ve listened to this 1000 times, I love that Ronnie is so versatile w/ his music and this is a masterpiece
Fuckin Ronnie... AMAZING as always... 🏴‍☠️💥🏴‍☠️
imagine him doing a toss a coin to your witcher cover
Holy shit...that was so fucking epic
Ronnie Radke should play the Phantom Of The Opera
I feel like I just watched a short vampire film. holy shit this is beautiful.
That's epic!!!!!
Ronnie, whatever people might say, whatever people might do...... please......... please make more of these remakes/songs <3 When i grew up the originals ment a lot to me, say what ever, I'm now 28 and this song means even more to me than ever <3 you voice... the power..... the emotions behind it <3 Please make more of this <3 We...... I LOVE IT! <3
Im not even into his band but this is awesome-  I feel like he could write a musical or act in one pretty successfully
Ronnie Is best Singer what i ever seen ♥️ Ronnie you Are god, thank you ♥️
I cant find anything on google- whats black sabbath
i hope more of their songs will be reimagined like his, cause this is freakin great
A friggin production
Intense!
was not expecting much from this song as it was all ready great. but fucking hell, that was beautyful. i got tears in my eyes. first half was soft and then in comes the metal sound. the sadness broke me.
I feel like watching Dark Shadows idk why you've made a perfect job Again 👏🏻😍🤘🏻
Felt like I just watched a whole movie. This is what I look for in music videos. I want to see how the artist envisions their own lyrics.
Holy fuck Ronnie........ great fuckin job
Ayy there's Paige/Sayara
Ronnie is a god
It is not by chance filmed at the same location as the clip by Palaye Royale called Tonight is the night I die ???!
That note at 5:48 always give me chills! What note is that?? :D
I’m pretty sure I’m the only one who’s sitting here like.. “This is stupid you don’t dig a grave with a flat head shovel..” 😂
Why did I just now realize that's Paige from WWE?
Yeah it’s definitely not a phase
POOOOOOOOOOOGGGGGGGGGG
YES DUDE YESS THIS IS WHAT WE NEED, THE DYING IS YOUR LATEST FASHION'S RONNIE FUCK YEAH. Such a piece of art.
WOOOOOW THIS IS- CHILLS
WWE fans where you at ?
I can't believe that's paige from WWE doesn't even look like her
The cinematography is STUNNING
DID I JUST WATCH A FUCKING MOVIE HOLY SHIT RONNY!!!!! SO FUCKING GOOD!!!!
I’m 20 this year and I’ve loved Ronnie ever since ‘Escape The Fate’ when my brother showed me ‘Situations’ and I love that he’s bringing back his older hits and singing them in a new way.. I loved how he did ‘The Drug In Me Is You Reimagined’ and I hope he continues to make his original songs and now and then bring back his older his in a new style
АХУЕННО!
He needs to collab with Lindsey sterling-  I'm sorry but it would awesome
I just realize that Saraya bevis aka Paige was the girl in the video. He included his gf in the video.
awww ronbon you sound like youre taking a shit
Love it ⚘❤🥀
This is how Dracula should be
Tonight Is The Night I Die?
The gothic atmosphere does it for this song 🔥🔥🔥
That's a pretty badass song.  He's a showman
Masterpiece !!!!! 1000x better than the original *.* who is that wonderful woman ?
Heres the thing. And who agrees. I like his originals and re do’s of old stuff equally cause one works for feeling badass and one works for emotional distress- the only thing I didn’t like is how he said black sabbath •___• black sabbēïth
woah
Jesus...
How can a band be in their prime.. twice.....? 😦 Falling In Reverse, you are doing... indescribably wonderful things.
another masterpiece....can we just appreciate ronnies insane talent? that piano..that voice..damn!!
fucking amazing!!! no other words. *chills*
The perfect remake dont exci .....
Was the costume inspired by Michael Jackson in Ghost?
GORGEOUS. BEAUTIFUL. THESE GIVE ME LIFE AND HELP MY CROPS GROW I FORGOT HOW TO BREATHE FOR A MINUTE
wow
is the same house used in the video tonight is the night i die (palaye royale) ahhaahah
Hi Ronnie.
How do you make this amazing song with popular monster and then also make  crap like this one, blows my mind. Will still buy your album tho
Next can we get Raised by wolves Reimagined
Saraya + Ronnie= Instant Classic
revamp Fashionably Late next
Anyone else getting major Murtagh vibes from him? Lmao
Around 4:14 I got chills and pretty much had em till the end .. Now ronnie needs to throw down a country one and he's golden on all genres ( if he sang it I'd even listen  )(not a country fan) 😏
I have patiently waited years for this. Somehow i knew it would come.
OMG! she is the fighter Saraya-Jade Bevis :D
Ronnie really be saving emo and doesn't get enough credit. IMO
RONNIE GANHA LÁ DO MENINO NO PEDRA PAPEL TESOURA ❤
epic
Wow dude why not come up with a original music video! This just a copy of MEATLOAF’s “ I will do anything for LOVE “ music video.
You have done it again. You are my #1 fave artist. So imaginative and artistic. So original always being great at everything you do
Im not a vampire reimagined by PR
Holy shit okay maybe Metalcore is dead
absolutely blown away by this and the drug in me is reimagined. absolutely stunning
I love that he included his beautiful girlfriend Paige🖤 in the video if y'all don't know she is a WWE superstar so i'm getting the best of both worlds rn I love them both🥰
this is a much darker, more emotional version of the original and it's PHENOMENAL.
I went from being obsessed with Ronnie to disgusted in him.  This song may just pull me back to those obsessed days.
4:58 Epic
Is that Paige?
This is such a fucking banger. I’m not rly into falling in reverse but I love this aesthetic.
It was beautiful.  And Page was in it which was awesome!
I have not listened to anything but this song for a week now. Hi my name is Ryan I'm an addict.
please never stop. please please please.
Comments about not being able to do something followed by Hold my X are the literal corniest shit ever Internet: Hold my ear
Amazing work falling in reverse!!!! Can’t get enough of your new stuff!!
Genius. Just like every other song.
Saraya is sooo beautiful 😍❤
IM SCRRAMINGNHENDNEJD
Freaking freak yeeeeeees!!!! Obsessed with this version. Freaking beautiful. Love when he uses his voice like this!!
THAT FREAKING STYLE MAN!!! KEEP IT, IT FITS YOUR MELANCHOLY!!!
No way-
This man is the god of music I swear
Me ericé. Me genera mucho sentimiento. Me encanta y no paro de escucharla ❤❤❤❤❤
I’m a werewolf, who want smoke?
I wondered what the best song of 2021 would be......
his fight with palaye royale worries me, because i don't want any of the videos to be deleted.  being a fan two two is being difficult lol
This is masterpiece
Ronnie Turing into a goth icon and I'm here for it.
huh
This is a musical masterpiece and a fucking movie at the same time
Is that Paige? The wrestler? She looks just like her.  Edit: after further research it most definitely is.
Es perfecto!🔥✔
AHHH I LOVE IT
that was so fucking cool ! still love the original just as much but this is gorgeous
Anyone here for mcnasty's comment
Que puta obra de arte!!
That was fucking AMAZING!!!!
I'm not a vampire but he's actually a vampire
That was amazing !
Paige😍
Wow Ronnie has evolved so much! this is so artistic and amazing
very cool
That was Fucking Lit 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Revamped = vampire way of saying reimagined, love it.
Vampire Ronnie has me feeling some type of way 🤩
Ronnie isn't Ronnie without the facial and neck tattoos
BRO THIS'S SO FUCKING COOL OMGGGG
0:45 I thought it was Aro from twilight lol
Revampired
hold onnnn a secOND IS THAT PAIGE FORMER WWE DIVAS CHAMPION!!!1
Anyone else here after the Sebastian danzig and Ronnie radke beef?
HOLY SHIT WHAT A MASTER PIECE
I saw this before, it's called Palaye Royale
this reminds me of Magika: "Hi, I'm vlad, and I'm not a vampire"
Who’s here before the tea between Sebs from Payale Royale and Ronnie?😂😂
Scenes when Ronnie looks so pale reminds me of Ville Valo in Join me in Death
What happened to his solo album on Spotify?
Awsome, goosebumps 👌
While not something I’d listen to, I love these reimagined songs because they show off your artistry
The amount of emotion in his voice when he sings is phenomenal you can clearly see the amount of effort and the portrayal within his acting is just *chef kisses* you’ve done him proud Ronnie
Bruh!!! Why im seeing this so late! Fuckin crazy! I love it!
Александр Ревва до того, как стал известным
gotta love how he included his gf paige, im really stuggling , to decide which version of this song i prefer though xD  Edit: after much consideration i decided i prefer this version of the song because for some reason it hits me alot different and i love it.
Revampired
AMAZING
Thanks for this Video.
I love! I love! 😍😍😍
I love how grim the most recent videos are getting!! I've listened to this revamped version so many times 😄👌
PLEASEEE LETS GET THIS NOMINATED FOR AN AWARD OML
What a masterpiece
Listen to this every day multiple times a day. I love it so much. He really put so much into this. Melodically it's brilliant. I love the build up to the end
Holy shit it's Ronnie radke collab with Paige sooooo cool
Is that wwe paige/ Sandra belvis ???? In the video with him or am I mistaken
I her comes for paige XD
Ronnie has done it again!

Vocals for days 💗
A Little Piece of Heaven anyone?
anyone team palaye??
Simply BEAUTIFUL.
I don't like the line where it says he shouldn't have been raised on black sabbath. That is spoken by somebody who has obviously never listened to the lyrics of any black sabbath song.  Other than that it  was pretty cool.
hmmm yep, still emo inside, great, thanks for the recommendation yt, you know me so well
Just incredible! I love this revamped songs . They're so so so so much better!
Def loving this song but my goodness!! Who’s that lady? She’s so gosh darn beautiful 😍😇
Falling in Reverse killing it as per usual. I never fell in love with this song originally but damn if I don’t love it now!
here AGAIN bc of the beef between ronnie radke and sebastian danzig
this is chilling what i love
This gives me the chills!!
I stand in awe!
3:23 is basically a little piece of heaven by avenged sevenfold, "were comming back comming back" you know the part
In my opinion....lycris are beautiful, the video too ceap
why he remind me of the mad hatter
Awesome... I have no other words. Will there be "Polpular Monster (Remonstered)"?
Aku suka sama video clipnya
Anything Ronnie has ever made is Epic
It's so beautiful, can't help my self, I totaly love this .❤
As much as I went off these a while ago, this was some true nostalgia.
Only he can make screaming sound good my to music other then your typical hardcore.
Trying to recreate The Drug In Me Is You - Reimagined, with a bit more energy. Too early, that's why it sounds forced and copied. If he would have tried that after a decade, it would be more interesting.
Ronnie going wild on IG is all I needed to go through this F pandemic 😆  👌🔥
EPIC
Dramatic enough to be a Van Helsing Movie.
It’s been four hours... still hard. ❤️❤️❤️
Awesome job Ronnie, just like always
I prefer Ronnie Radke the vampire over Dracula.
I love this man's voice. An domg the piano in this song and The Drug In Me Reimagined is just beautiful. I'm obsessed. I'm have such a fascination with him
OMG WHY HAVE I NOT LISTENED TO THIS DUDE BEFORE!?!? HIS FUCKING VOICE IS BEAUTIFUL I CAN'T STOP SMILING FROM IT❤❤
J'adore
What's the Tea about Ronnie and Sebastian Danziggggzagg?
This is so good that it's a bit overwhelming to be honest. There's so much emotion in his voice, and the way the music builds up, this deserves an award.
The bath tub scene reminds me of Blade 2 when Blade bites his wrist to save Nyssa. Anyone else?
Ronnie copied Palaye Royale so hard. 🖖🖖
Paigeeeeee(Saraya)!!! She looks so good 🥺🥰❤️❤️
I NEED FIR ON BROADWAY ASAP!!!!!!!
Call it classical metal.
Ronnie got me pregnant again with his voice. This is like the fifth time. I didn’t even know guys could get pregnant.
I love this. But all I can see is Remington standing on that staircase, Emerson dancing in that hall and Sebastian running in the woods....
Holy crap, this is amazing ! Well done guys ❤️
godddd dammm u make me cry god dammmmeettt Ronnie
I don't think this is the same song from 10 years ago
He should of been  more aggressive with this melody. It was too soft for me. I like the original better.
great song
My interpretation of a storyline is  The lady (Paige) is reminiscing of various memories and events that happened to both Her, Him (Ronnie), and their relationship before she chooses to finally rejoin Him (as he is obviously already dead) and that's why we see her dressed in the white lacey outfit as she burns at the end.
This video was absolutely beautiful guys, amazing work Ronnie 💕
The rise of Paganini.. revamped.
Hmmmm Interview with a Vampire with just a hint of Crimson Peak... I love it
This gives me Tim Burton Sleepy Hollow vibes
When you literally copy up & coming bands thinking no one will notice. 👀
RONNIE IS FCKIN AWESOME 🔥
Did he just attempt to make an AFI video?
Amazing storytelling. Two different storylines merging together.  One storyline is before Ronnie dies and the second is after.  Whenever she is in the white nightgown it's the present after he is killed by the mob.  The parts with Ronnie are visions she has from the past and is her remembering their life together.  She then realizes she is lonely and can no longer live, not sure if it's beause she misses him or doesn't want to become like him.  I could be wrong but I think when he is burning at the stake and she is burning on the balcony these are not happening simultaneously but Ronnie in the past and her in the present.  Just my take on the narrative after rewatching it a few times.    Also I don't think I can name another song where a singer utilizes this many vocal styles in a single song.  I mean he hits bombastic lows and beautiful highs, he pulls off vibratos and falsettos, the scatting esque part about throwing up, the awesome layered vocal on "Hi my name is Ronnie and I'm addict", the theatrical screeching, both aggressive and melodic screaming(I mean that coda/outro gives me chills every time).  I mean damn, might get flack for this but the first comparison I could think of was Freddie Mercury since they both have voices that mesmerize you.  Just my thoughts
Reminds me a little of ice nine kills
Can anyone explain why Ronnie is having a go at palaye royale on his insta story? Did the band steal from FIR? (Just really curious and confused)
Holy shit this is amazing
Some vampire diaries thing going on here
He gives me Severus Snape vibes and I love it
i literally was like oooOOOooh yass another gothic version like drug in me is reimagined
I have enjoyed every piece of this outstanding music video!! Since it was released, I'm watching this three times a day with my meals, like it should be
KEEP THESE GOTHIC COVERS COMING!!!
Shit! This is great, even better the drug is my You re imagined fuck :'3
What a monster remix...to sum it up in 1 word.....   EPIC!
Ronnie is like Andrew WK's little emo cousin who's trying to prove himself lmao. I mean it works, but still the comparison is hilarious!
The revamped part makes me chuckle
Is this song like when you hold an intervention for someone and they tell you they aren't an addict?
Ronnie your talent is unbelievable.  When The Drug In Me Is You album came out in 2011 years ago you did a show in downtown Tulsa when the Vanguard used to be the Marquee and to this day it's the greatest show I've ever been to. Man it's crazy how much has changed since then. Love this🤟
k man.... I'd really digging this reimagined series. I really hope you keep it up :)
Apakah ada orang indonesia disini?
Epic! Keep them coming. Amazing transformation and depth
He just needs to release a re- album. Take all his good songs and reimagine them into a album all like this.
Vocal range is mad!
I was hoping Ronnie was going to waste the towns people in a sea of blood when they stormed his house. Oh well. EPIC REVAMP!
emopera
This revamp is Epic and very very very good, i love this. V----V 😍
He would make an awesome Phantom of the Opera.  The last person I thought that about was Freddie Mercury...just sayin
Holy focking shit, its so amazing
“revamped” “reimagined” I do not care Ronnie Radke will deliver . JESUS RONNIE THIS IS GREAT. THE VIDEO IS MOVIE LIKE.  someone give ronnie his CREDIT
I will always love the original but this gave me fucking chills 🔥🔥
2k robots couldnt handle their emotions geesh soulles scalliwags.
Plays this in Christian town out loud  Oopsies
listened to this so many times
That was amazing!! Time to watch some reactions 😉
Beautiful new version of the song and Paige in the video! I'm in love!
The fact that Paige was involved makes it that much better
Absolutely beautiful Ronnie's voice both saraya and ronnie the house I must have listened to this song over and over for the last week .would love to see ronnie perform this in the UK
I.. have no words 🥀♡
Cuz im going straight to hell and im taking you down with me because you know damn well...
I see that Jack White is still fine
Omg where is my selfcontrol?? this is insane, omg!! WOOOOOOOW! I JUST ENJOY THIS MASTERPIECE SINCE SECOND 1. Congrats Falling in Reverse!
This song, in this version, it's like a drug. Totally addicted. Today I was going at work listening to this masterpiece. When I turned off my mp3 reader I started singing without the music. A total masterpiece!
I hated the rap shit, this isn't much better but it's slightly better. I hope this leads back to them going back to the original sound because I hate when bands do this shit.
This music video is next level!!!!!
Can you imagine this song in concert? Especially with that ending.. I get goosebumps just thinking about it.
I got chills by the "in loving memory." Derek is missed terribly, and my heart goes out to you guys.
Hehe re-vamped
aro who
Ronnie looks handsome but also scary in this video, I don’t like it
Wow wow wow the chills i got are the most ive ever had from a song. You can really feel the emotio  from Ronnie like wow. Bravo bravo
Ronnie got that good good voice
Im loving this new Ronnie
Mean this as a compliment, he looks like a young Weird Al
CAN'T WATCHING THIS MASTERPIECE 😩 the talent man, I'm so glad I got tickets to your shows 🤞🏻. RIP Derek🌹
Ronnie roule moi dessus... pardon mais putain😭
THIS IS AMAZINGGGGGGG
holy shit. chill ronnie! you are the future of music, literally THE KING OF THE MUSIC SCENE. cant wait to see yall again!
Wish I could hit the like button more than once🥺❤️
Nothing to say... just wonderful bravo my friend
🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇
Ronnie is the most under appreciated artist of any genre.
Not going to lie, at 5:18 I thought the villagers were so dead lol. I saw ronnie standing there nonchalantly as they ran at him and thought they were so done
I hope we get Gangsta’s Paradise reimagined next.
paige looks 🔥🔥
Not a fan of this one but good effort. Feels all over the place somehow like you're trying to do too much. But anyway,  I know you're gonna get better in this genre. Just keep at it ;)
This is the content we love from falling in reverse. Keep it coming ronnie, I love it!
TIM BURTON FUCKING BE LIKE <33333333333
The “hi my name is Ronnie I’m an addict” part when they come to show him the pics of the girl and he shakes his head like no I don’t know nothing about it.. ugh so deep this shit is like a movie like twilight on drugs!!
Legendary
hello, from indonesian :)
Most of us were raised on Black Sabbath. Exspecially if ur parent is round 6ish.
What a masterpiece!!
Is there a genre Falling in Reverse isn’t the best at? Smashing it Ronnie!
Videography + Cinematography are insane added with Ronnies voice and vocal storytelling absolutly fucking breathtaking im speechless masterpiece and award worthy 100%
Just isn’t what he used to be.
being a huge fan of the original its fun to try and sing it again watching it my first time through. but his dynamic is so broad i can never guess how hes gonna sing it next lol. still a fkn banger
Masterpiece.
Its amazing how the earth moves with this man. I hope he gets the credit he deserves. He is honestly in Mercury's footsteps, just his own story.... this man is powerful mentally and physically in HIS genre this man owns this shit.... rise with the fucking gods Ronnie.... much love dude..
AMAZING! BEAUTIFUL!!!
I cant stop listening to this over and over i love it so much 🥺🥺🕯🕯🕯🕯🕯🕯🕯🕯🕯🕯🕯🕯🕯🕯🕯🕯🕯🕯🕯🕯🕯🕯🕯🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻
It’s gotta be Raised by Wolves next right?
Дворец путина)
Masterpiece
Page needs to be in every Falling In Reverse music video from now on!🤘🏻
He kinda looks like the fella from Afi when he had long hair 🤔🤟
Let me guess you're going to be one of those artists that tries to redo every song you have dumb as f*** if you want to be different make new songs because guess what all you're doing is hiding
The Drug In Me Is You was well done redone but this song is complete and total f****** dogshit I would rather go listen to the original one stop revamping music you had one good hit that doesn't mean they're all going to be good if you want to be different make new songs don't read or your old ones because this one sucks ass
SHIVERS
Probs they'll never read this... but i was having such a hard depresión, a fucking rough time that i was feeling i'll go insane or kill myself but this: popular monster and the drug in me is you reimagined; are keeping me sane more than everything i know ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Musicians please note, this is how to write a song how to sing a song and how to make a kick ass video
This is amazing, oh my gods
Omg, this is amazing. 👏🏻
https://youtu.be/s6Qh0I6snfE
Seeing this made my day
tHE DRAMATICS 10/10 better than The Originals
Terrible
I love how when i was a kid listening to these i would sing these to myself in the slowed calm tone- AND NOW HES DOING IT ITSKDNDKSNDJS its doing so much for me and i love it. Emo doesnt die stg 💀💀
This sounds like a legit film score and I love it. Would sound right at home in something like a Tim Burton film.
God damn he is just so awesome
THE MUSIC, THE VIBES, THE OUTFIT, THE PERSON, MATCH WITH A VAMPIRE THINGS...OMG
Anne Rice fan much?
Genius. Simply genius. Ronnie never ceases to amaze me!
you're incredible.
Me encanta increíble
When he screams “where is my self control” hit me on a spiritual level
If this doesn't get any awards, I'll be wondering if the industry even acknowledges metal and melodic metal into its ranks. This song deserves to be heard by millions. It's a masterpiece.
That was so intense but I loved it good job
All I gotta say is Holy Crap.
Totally speachless, it's so beautiful and haunting wow
Ronnie missed his calling being in Twilight
beutiful music rock
Wow!
The fucking talent this man has. The fucking VISION this man has! It is unprecedented
A WHOLE ASS CINEMATIC MASTERPIECE
Best thing about this was seeing Paige.
In this video he looks like the Aro of the Volturi (Twilight) HAHAHHA
Ronnie is slowly morphing into Davy Havok.
Claps for the revamped version! Both awesome!
the ronster
no words! what an absolute banger!! you really need to do others like this (good girls, bad guys....    caught like a fly.... raised by wolves) LOVE THEM <3
this music video is amazing,, wow , like wow,,,
wow
WHOA
What even is up with this wonderful set of vocals i am enthralled
Slk mano ronnie é muito gato não tem como não
amé esta versiooooon aaaaah!! no dejo de escucharlaaaa
best thing i ever listen in my life
The vampire diaries
I listen to this 10+ times a day... it’s just too good i’m sorry
great song just wow
holy SHIT
<3
???
Is that page
YES, everyone... that is PAIGE!!!! She is Ronnie's girlfriend and has been for a couple of years now!!!
would love to see these guy's live hopefully Colorado 2021.
Okey en "The drug in me is you reimagined" me quedé con ganas de más Ronnie en versión vampiro, este videoclip es una obra de arte,  gracias!!
Oh My god
Is that Paige from wwe?
Liking the video before I’ve even heard it as i know it’ll be a banger 🤘🏻
Mano QUE FODA !!! Muito bom cara se Loko
Was never much into the original. But this is an entirely different level. Mind blowing! What a performance in every respect! A masterpiece - the arrangement, the vocal performance, the visuals! Please more of this stuff!
Is that Paige?
I can't stop listening to it and I don't need help.
so good,more pls
🖤
The ending is so raw pure and full of emotions. I love when ronnie does this and sings from his heart. 🖤 you can litterally feel every word he says.
He's done it again, another banger!
Y’all can’t tell me the opening sounds like something from death note
in love
24/02/21
I actually get the song because I'm actually feeling the same way
this band is soooo soooo fucking underrated <3
Took my breath away 💜💜💜
Good girls bad guys is def gonna top off the trilogy
Page from wwe!!!!
It has a queen feel to it I love it
I swear if ronnie makes the album that im not a vampire and the drug in me is you in to an entirely remained one ill sell my house to by every album. This shit is way to good. The pain and anguish in this version justs hits home how hard being a recovering addict is for ronnie. Me being a recovering addict myself this gets me in my feels so fucking hard.
2:26 part is fcking soulful i love it
If all else fails.....in 2021.....at least I was able to have this.
You did an amazing job Ronnie and Paige
I want them to collab with Amy Lee of Evanescence PLEASE!
WOOOOOW  seriously  Wwooooow, I’m speechless
Do an entire album of remakes, it would do well
When I say I am SHOOK.
Omfg this is so beautiful 😭
Ronnie is the Mike Patton of his generation. The man has a bright future no doubt about that!
Ronnie needs to write a series and put it on netflix
6:12 R.I.P 'DEREK JONES'
Well, I'm not a vampire, but I feel like one Sometimes I sleep all day 'cause I hate the sunlight My hands are always shaking Body's always aching, and the dark is when I feed Well, I can lure any woman that I want to in my bed with me   And whiskey seems to be my holy water And mothers, better lock your doors and hide your daughters   'Cause I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold? For goodness sakes, where is my self-control? If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all hope   Well, I'm not a zombie, but I feel like one today Self-induced comatose, chemical daze My head is always spinning from this dizzy blurry vision and my stomach has had enough I feel like a lady that is pregnant with a baby 'cause I'm always throwing up   And hi, my name is Ronnie, I'm an addict And daddy should've never raised me on Black Sabbath   I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold? For goodness sakes, where is my self-control? If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all hope   When will you mortals believe? (He's not a vampire) I just want the world to bleed (He's not a vampire) Lust at the sight of your blood (He's not a vampire) I swear to God, I am not a...(He is not a...) (He is not a...)   So God bless all of you now 'Cause I'm going straight to Hell (Straight to Hell) And I'm taking you down with me Because you know damn well ] So I sharpen my teeth 'cause I love the way it feels When I sink into your skin and draw the only thing that's real You don't believe me, should I write it in blood? You better drive that fucking stake right down my heart and try to run Motherfucker, I'm a vampire!   And I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold? For goodness sakes, where is my self-control? If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all Heart has fucking lost all Heart has lost all hope (He's lost all hope) (He's lost all hope) (He's lost all hope) All hope, my heart has lost all hope https://lyricstranslate.com
This Artist is the only one who makes me love music again, so thank you very much.
Fucking awesome..
His voice is like ripping me apart and I love it so much 😭🥺❤
rip Derek Jones
Love it!
I love his voice so much. The lyrics are imaginative. I wish the imagery of the video was a touch less literal, but I still enjoyed it
this new sound hes done with this song and the drug in me is you reimagined is the best thing I wish he would do more in this style

Revamped and I'm obsessed again. So slow compared to the original but it's perfect
I feel like a vampyr too.
Please just make a whole album of songs like this. Amazing.
im up for "Resink or Reswim"
what a masterpiece!
I just cant stop listening to this!
Honestly can you do a Collab with escape the fate and redo situations? Cause I can't wrap my head around how that would sound
PURE FUCKING GENIUS !!
The dislikes are from the townsfolk in the video
💯
He looks like a young Severus Snape😅
Good that you got a second chance the first try sucked
OMG is literally a masterpiece. Amazing
That one part sounds like one the avengers come together 😆❣
Thankyou for your music Ronnie Radke
Wtfff🔥🔥🔥
gol contra
nunca mais faz isso dnv
ronnie pede desculpa agora e nunca mais faz isso de novo
Who else didn’t realize all his tattoos were covered??
This song truly touched my soul. Ronnie and falling in reverse is only getting better with age. EPIC! More please.
🖤🖤🖤
0:56 something about his small movements really feels weird but i like it, 2:16 i love the delivery of 'Today' and 'self induced comatose' and at 4:55 The small voice cracks and multiple different pitches as Ronnie transitions from clean vocals to screaming is amazing, Loving these new remasters of old songs. <3
Everyone: there's no way you can do better the the drug in me reimagined  Ronnie: WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY TO ME YOU LITTLE BITCH
I got a ad of a super cool band with a mask on if anyone knows the bands name please tell me 😞 they had a singer in it too.
Is that our siren Paige?
ok im back again i cant get over how good this is
The music is great but can we also appreciate how beautiful Paige is in this.
OMG TREMENDO PEDAZO DE ARTE ACABA DE BENDECIR MIS OIDOS
I think my man Ronnie rediscovered OG Evanescence recently
Fudging incredible, chills, wow
Holly Dame,, as soon as I heard his voice,so different from his song he sings about being insane, forgot the name,he looks like my friend Matt, just found this song, was scrolling threw utube, powerful voice ronster 😙😛 And the symphony orchestra music God just adds to it, and Ronnie's range of vocal is epic. I am a trained singer but Dame.
This gives me BIG dark shadows vibes :"3 its so amazingngnng!!!!!!😩
I don't normally leave comments on youtube. But I can't get over how this version and how much the lyrics get to me. I've been listening to this for days on end now and it still gives me chills. Been a fan for a few years, personally, I think you've grown. Just amazing talent throughout.
don't miss.
I heard this a coupke days ago and it is amazing. I love the epic choir background. If someone doesnt put this in a movie soundtrack, i will die. Its an amazing work of art and i love it. Great work Ronnie.
One of the best songs I’ve heard.  Ronnie’s singing and range is amazing.  Ronnie and Paige could consider being actors on the side.  Also, Ronnie if you look at posts you mentioned in a reaction that your hoping the rocking granny’s react to this song/video.  They have and like it...
Ravishing Ronnie strikes again.  YOU have an exceptional talent that not many possess. I enjoy watching your talent get more fine tuned and perfected.  Keep going.  This leaves me wanting more!
FIR  on broadway? Yes please
That shit hit hard man
DAMN just damnnnn my soulll can feeeeel it🖤
Showed this to my friend and his immediate quote "Wow when you realize you're suddenly looking at the major leagues of what music is supposed to be" and you know fucking true #ronnieistheking
I want to like this 1000 times. But YouTube won't let me.  Just take 1.
how is this the same FUCKING SONG. THIS IS BEAUTIFUL
song about drugs turned into vampiric Victorian romance...I love it
Well, it's proven, he's the best of all music genres ... please, don't join the (trash) reggaeton. 🙌🙌🙌
I have watched this every evening for the last week and it gets better each time.
I'm in love of this man 😍
im sweating. that was... a moment.
EPIC
someone pls tell Ronnie to wear this suit more and do his hair like this all the time <3
The white Paige is not a ghost but rather the vampire spirit of the transitioning Paige. It will not make sense to turn her and then take decisions that will kill her, unless it really didn't kill her. Her real body last time it was seen it was inside the house resting in a couch and it was only her vampire spirit at the window. So my take is when he dies her vampire side dies too but leaving her mortal body behind, making her human and truly saving her in the end. Specially there is a myth that is you kill the vampire that change you before you fully transform or make your first kill, the victim will return to human.
If this doesn't win a Bes Music Video or Best Song award I swear to God....
i love this sm !! Paige and Ronnie look amazing !!💗
Waiting for an entire album of remakes like this!
This  once was my  favorite song  and  to see  it  remastered like this is truly a gift thank you.
It's such a loving version! It's so beautiful! Just the way he puts the words into a more deeper tone it's just amazing..
Now imagine popular monster remastered 🙏🏻
Excellent  job! <3
THAT'S WHY I LOVE THIS GUY FUCK!!!😍😍😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
Ronnie to Epitaph: So I've got this idea. Epitaph: Yes. Yes, whatever it is, yes.
Damn Ronnie, you knocked this out of the park and and broke the scoreboard of the next stadium over.  Truly awesome!!!
Uffff
a question the last scene of the mount where the vampire died is allusive to the golgota where they crucified Jesus? , I don't know but it gave me that insight
Man its amazing that all my favorite songs as a teenager are being revamped to match my maturity it feels like the songs are growing and changing as I grow older and my taste changes 😍😍😍😍
This was dope af
First album I ever bought from F.I.R. back when H.T. still sold CDs. Still have it in rotation when it is time to work out or run.
Now it's metallica, iron maiden, rammstein in stadia. imagine this with a whole orchestra with a full stadium, some fire and fireworks, dancers and costumes.
Recamped I love it goes with the song title also Ronnie with long hair gives off the best vibes ever and the remastered versions FIR are doing are so good I love the new direction they're heading in.
The original one was good. This bring me to tears every time I listen to it ( I have listen to this none stop) like I feel this in my bones. I love falling in reverse. Their songs have gotten through so many tough times in life. This song is truly amazing and the vocal range and control is crazy. Everything they put out is a banger and filled with so many emotions and I love it
Rest in peace D.R.. 😔
❤❤❤ Absolutely love these revamped songs!!! Please dear god keep doing more!
Ngl I absolutely hated the original but this is a fucking amazing piece of art, it's so amazing can't stop listening lol
Which part of Twilight is this
I'm still a zombie ole son
Ronnie without tattoos is just fucking weird
Ronnie in Dani filth version
That black sabath part tho
Божественно 😍  Я могу  смотреть и слушать этот шедевр бесконечно
How is a Drug song now a love song? Oh wait getting drugs is a love song! This song is deep to a recovering addict
I can't stop listening to this song.
I love u ❤️❤️❤️❤️
i cried
I dig it!
I need a miracle I'm falling way too fast, I'm sinking in too deep I need an angel now, that's watching over me If I could just wake up, if I could make you see I'm all alone, all alone with your sickness in me
July canncers on a Tuesday
excelent ronnie
xd!
Jesus... Outstanding🙏🏻  By the Way.... Radke without Tattoos  is so strange...😄🤙🏻
I literally listened to this with my jaw dropped the whole time, god damn can Ronnie sing🥵😵🖤 4:57 I almost shit myself holy fuck
This singer is trying his best to make something out of this poorly written lyrics.
This is beautiful 🤩
Wow thatwas  just amazing. my face was like that  😲 all the song
Do I see a "My Apocalypse" revamp?
Remember that Key and Peele sketch about 'vanity' music videos? Just curious.
Why is no one talking about Paige she literally is flawless
Love it !! Wow Paige looks absolutely stunning
anyone getting a loki feel from how hes dressed lol
My, how very Vampire Hunter D of you
that was a weak ass vampire xD
wooowwww wooowwww
holy shit
i never felt like a vampire, but all the points seem to fit me xD
Wow!!
Ronnie can sing like an angel and scream like the devil.  This guy is so talented !
Juste waouh
Amazing!🔥
This I blood-chilling, simply fangastic
I prefer old version
This guy is an absolute genius, the talent is unbelievable, cant wait to see him live when ever he comes to the UK
Amazing good job man
I am now convinced that ronnie could release a country song and it be an absolute banger!
I'm so sorry but I hate This I mean I still love the old version and popular monster and stuff but.... This eh
Please continue doing these revamps my god I live for them 🥲 So crazy to watch the original version of this song and the video. Then come to this, it’s just incredible. 🥲
I can't get enough of this song...
holy fuck that gave me a shit ton of goosebumps
Oh. My. God.
pov: bella and edward get a divorce after 1000 years
Omg im in love!! Love this music!
Is the best thing that I ever heard
this is god damn beauful as hell
wouaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...same as Reimagined, a great MASTER REVAMPED !!! Maturity time after time, and since many years... ABSOLUTELY GREAT Damned... I would be a producer, a long time ago that I would have proposed to Ronnie, the main role of a Vampire for a great film ... who better than him for this role since all the time ??? Thx a lots lots lotssssssssssssssss ( with Miss Radke's Paige in guest )
Wow..... no coments 🤯🤯🤯
Masterpiece. If songs had museums, this would need it's own building.
love love love this. no other band is doing this, FIR is always pushing it to new levels
So motherfking lit
Wow
Ronnie Radkie's talent is so perfect.
Omg it is BEAUTIFUL!
It's beautiful. 🥰😯😱
Anytime I hear this song, it reminds me of my ex boyfriend 💔 I had to end it with him, and I will always love him. I miss him more then words can express.
Ronnie giving Loki vibes at some point 😄
I really hope we get a whole revamped album. I would buy it in a heartbeat
this reminds me of Tim Burton’s Dark Shadows especially when he gets to the cliff 😍 it’s so good man
Why am I inlove with this revamped version 😭❤️
THE FUCKING ORCHESTRA 😭❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love the original,  but this just has so much more intensity. So fucking good.
Imagine Ronnie in Twilight😂   (dont attack me with the twilight is a shitty movie whatsoever i get it )
When u replay the game and it’s a Halloween event
Holy shit this is so much more amazing than I expected
Sometime's I forget Ronnie can actually sing and doesnt just scream haha
This is the definition of EPIC
This song deserves a fuckin grammy
GOOSEBUMPS MAAAAN
absolutely amazing im so proud of this man and the drug in me reimagined and now this I can’t stop sharing there absolutely hits
Wow hos hair got long 😍
This be giving me Vampire diaries vibes and the Originals Vibes 😌❤👑
i saw this one coming, but the term "revamped" is genius, it fits the title so much
Muito bom ♥️♥️
I Just Love It
I like it. I was nervous cuz revamping such an iconic song is kinda risking. But this was well done.
😱😰😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱❤❤❤
Well, I'm not a vampire, but I feel like one Sometimes I sleep all day 'cause I hate the sunlight My hands are always shaking Body's always aching, and the dark is when I feed Well, I can lure any woman that I want to in my bed with me And whiskey seems to be my holy water And mothers, better lock your doors and hide your daughters 'Cause I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold? For goodness sakes, where is my self-control? If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all hope Well, I'm not a zombie, but I feel like one today Self-induced comatose, chemical daze My head is always spinning from this dizzy blurry vision and my stomach has had enough I feel like a lady that is pregnant with a baby 'cause I'm always throwing up And hi, my name is Ronnie, I'm an addict And daddy should've never raised me on Black Sabbath I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold? For goodness sakes, where is my self-control? If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all hope When will you mortals believe? (He's not a vampire) I just want the world to bleed (He's not a vampire) Lust at the sight of your blood (He's not a vampire) I swear to God, I am not a...(He is not a...) (He is not a...) So God bless all of you now 'Cause I'm going straight to Hell (Straight to Hell) And I'm taking you down with me Because you know damn well ] So I sharpen my teeth 'cause I love the way it feels When I sink into your skin and draw the only thing that's real You don't believe me, should I write it in blood? You better drive that fucking stake right down my heart and try to run Motherfucker, I'm a vampire! And I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold? For goodness sakes, where is my self-control? If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all Heart has fucking lost all Heart has lost all hope (He's lost all hope) (He's lost all hope) (He's lost all hope) All hope, my heart has lost all hope
Oh my God! Big Big great sound!
I remember the original coming out I'd never turn it off and now this is going to be the same 😄🤘🏻
05:06  Straight from a Van Helsing Movie !!!!
Ronnie reminds me of Vanya
WOW!!!!! Original Ben Cross DARK SHADOWS vibes!!!!! TOTALLY ...The mansion, rooms, stairs, etc... this is a masterpiece! AMAZING! Makes me wanna watch the miniseries again
It's cool
give this man a fucking oscar right now.
Gotta say I prefer the original with this one
That was a fucking masterpiece. Both musically and cinematographically.
I could just watch this all over again, this revamp is brilliant
The vocals at 4:15 are insane, my ears and eyes are blessed, this is a real masterpiece.
I think Ronnie would be a brilliant musical singer/actor if he ever decides to change professions. Awesome 🤘🏻
Where's this mans Oscar or Grammy Award cause GODAMN this dude is amazingly talented
This is so amazing it should have a movie of its own
The best and most beautiful video made so far🧛🏻‍♂️👌🏻
Honestly never imagined hearing this kind of version but Ronnie just keeps evolving his music and I'm loving it
I just found this song and it's awesome
This is cinematic
Some of the lyrics are so stupid... But considering you wrote this when you were much younger, well. I guess I can look away from that. "I feel like a lady that is pregnant with a baby cuz I am always throwing up." Ronnie. What else would she be pregnant with? A lamp? Do they not teach you how to write in jail? Could have sworn you had to do something productive in there...
1.5 million views. Half of those are probably me. Incredible!
Omg... so much emotion in this... I feel every word every thought and more🥺😭 ronnie you are amazing at what you do! Plz god keep this up! The passion I feel in you’re heart of you’re voice is pure and I want more! You sir have been threw a lot and I can feel it just threw you’re words and you’re music and I want you to know keep at it we love how you are doing it we want more! Stay strong ronnie and let you’re soul speak threw the songs you sing and write!
Yessss Ronnie is back 🙌
this is probably the most power I have ever heard in a persons voice while singing and I loved every second of it.
that was absolutely amazing and one of the greatest songs I have ever listened to. It was incredible.
I didn't expect the song to sound so epic played slowly, and that damn video just sent it over the edge. 10/10 for me.
If Ronnie and the band decide to release an entire album in the future as a special and it’s all reimagined songs like this and the drug in me is you (which play religiously) I promise you Epitaph Records, we WILL BUY ALL OF THEM
my new fav. really love it! <3
You can just see that they have matured as a band
Pure Bliss
Ronnie, can you yes
this isn’t a music video, it’s a fucking movie
Palaye royale dude
Love the that they used an Anne Rice style of vampire. Love it
Everytime you drop a song, I keep saying "he has just reached the peak in his career because of this song"  And then you drop another banger and prove me and everyone wrong. Keep up the work man. I can honestly say I have listened to all your work, at least all that's been on YouTube or album release.
Woooooowwww soooo fu ing dammm good 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
I just watched this twice in a row its so good im loving it
He went from scene/emo to rapper to goth
C E L E S T I A L
Music of the Year
Ronnie's journey in the last 17 years has been insane.
Can we get a behind the scenes?
This deserves so many more views than it has......such a MASTERPIECE
I enjoy it when he does music like this and "the drug in me is you reimagined". Beautiful
Pretty weak for so much hype.
*sudden soulpiercing intensity* and ~~HI MY NAME IS RONNIE. I’M AN ADDICTTTtttt...~~
I cried this is so damn good. Thank you for a beautiful masterpiece.
Beautiful! Chilling! Extravagant!
What a fuckin masterpiece
FUCKING AWESEOMEEEEEE I LOVE ITT
Ronnie does love flames at the end of this revamp/reimagined version. 🔥🔥🔥
Wow, the new Twilight trailer looks great
More of this.
I don't understand is he trying to make this a off set acoustic type version or something?
Wow....
I'm calling ronnie's gonna remake good girls bad guys and raised by the wolves
So this is what happens when I have a break from twitch 😯❤🖤🤘.  Ronnie and Saraya you created a mini cinematic film not justa film clip.  A lot of hard work would have gone into this fkn masterpiece.  Saraya, you have some acting skills girl!. You really suit that 1800s look. Bloody amazing!!!!  I'm binging this.  You're vocals are insane and the message in" I'm not a vampire " was reborn and revamped.  It's one of your best. Your creativity and versatility blows my mind. Well done and thankyou  🖤🤘 Stefolou 👐
make thousands of these songs bro your voice is fucking magic and you piano skills are straight fire Ive never heard anything so beautiful please this and the drug in me reimagined
A masterpiece , music is becoming a art with Ronnie really love it
The end gives my goose bumps. U can feel his anger and pain he sings and screams from his soul.
I need more
i say WOOOW.. what i see?  Wan Helsing with Underworld... :) my finaly worlds.. i love this...
Me quede pegado al video 😅 parecia una peli grande falling in reverse lo volvieron hacer buenardooooooooo
The title of this song is deceptive
Ooooh "The Drug In Me Is Reimagined" was uploaded Feb. 13, 2020 and this was uploaded Feb. 12, 2021 :'O
3:51 his voice is resonating in my heart oml
literally never considered listening to this band before. I've never had the thought of clicking on one of their videos, gave it a chance, now I'm addicted.
Wow! This makes me wanna move into an old gothic castle and fall in love with a vampire sooo bad .. 😍😱
I used to love these songs, lyrics and the strong personality of Ronnie, not i gotta be aesthetically pleased and attracted as well. This is getting too much to bare.
Thats some powerful stuff man! Well done.
This awakened my repressed teenage paranormal romance fan
Would love to hear them with Amy Lee Would be beyond amazing
Absolutely beautiful masterpiece!! Wow!!
I don’t know man, that’s something a vampire would say. Ronnie has just aged backwards. He looks younger now than he did while he was in Escape the Fate. 🤔🤔🤔
little bit dramatic for my taste for a song about partying so hard you feel it later
No se si me gusta más Ronnie o Paige
10 out of 10 would listen again. Will always love that voice 🤘🏽
I’m completely in shock by their transition 🤭🤯
I feel like the true genius can pick your feelings and remix it again into a new one. Like Nirvana comes with unplugged versions Ronnie returns with new versions of his own creation. So addictive =D
That was legit *amazing* ohh my god!! 😱
I absolutely LOVE this re- doing old songs in this style thing. Like, PLEASE do that whole album. It is so good, pulls at my heart strings, especially when done this way. I can't even express how much I love it.
I don't there is anything this band can't do..
WOW
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS!!
i love the song its just as amazing as the drug in me is reimagined both are so nice.  also popular monster is 10/10   love you guys <3
Popular Monster: "THIS ISN'T EVEN MY FINAL FORM"
Modern day Meatloaf, what an intricate and beautiful masterpiece.
Thank You Mr. Ronnie You speak the truth.
Literal fucking chills. This belongs in a movie score
Preciosa historia ! Ronnie eres el mejor !!!!!
Holy mother of God... Did i just cry because of a Music video? Ronnie... You are a fck*ng God!
I volunteer to have my blood chugged by Ronnie
Downvotes are the pissed off people who taking Vampire-Ronnie out of his mansion
magnifique bravo
This video is fucking dope as hell. The emotions,  the vocal range, the fucking "movie" hellz yes!!!!!! I can't say enough good about this video!!!!!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🎤🎤🎤🎶🎶🎧🎧
5:07 actually sounds like he is burning alive. so sick
This is cinematic art and a musical masterpiece.
This is amazing 🙌🏼🙌🏼
ya mola khon khari dar eslam haram ast
Is this how you feel when you get make your first purchase at Hot Topic?
the power of his voice is something unreal
that..... was intense.... and i love it!
<3
Inspiring!
This song has so much emotion that I'm crying...woah that hasn't happened in a WHILE
RONNIE IS BACK GUYS!!!! 2021 IS SAVED
wow this is a literal masterpiece the song the video everything about this is pure perfection
Ronnie reminds of Dracula from Bram Stokers Dracula with Keanu Reeves. Ronnies mind is a masterpiece
Let me get my Stewie voice on.... Ronnie, ronnie, hey hey ronnie, rooonnie, Ronnie....RONNNNNIE!!..... The grannies did they're reaction to this... They love you and will make you cookies... Ronnie come to the grannie squad.<-----insert vader voice. Thank you that is all!
Does anyone know how Derk passed away?
Damn this is edgy as fuck but this guy can sing ,holy shit
This nigga Ronnie still got it 👏🏾 good stuff brother, seriously.
I've listened to the song 20 times already I see 6 view points the old vampire ronnie, the pre vamp page,the villagers/vid page family,the ghost ronnie,the vamp page,and the choir. If the lyrics are any idicator ofthe double meaning words and go 2 angles with each view watching the acts and add emotion that's 18 layers already. A true master piece. The song one by metallica is one of the few songs that can beat this. So phenomenal, just beautiful.
Love the orchestra
Why does ronnie look so different. Use to listen to these guys + go to their concerts when falling in reverse was in its prime. Played songs from them on clone hero so i came back to see what they doing and it’s all different now lol but mainly his look
This is ART! This is MUSIC!
Legit couldn’t be more in love with this song. Your killing this shit Ronnie like you have been from day 1 brother I’m 23 now and enjoy your music more and more by the year!
Stop fucking with the originals.. They sound better than the shiit you make of it now..
Но круто
I got this on a Daz_Black video as an ad so I'm here to like the actual video
Meu Deus ficou tão lindo nossa senhora isso vai se tornar clássico um dia
Top job brother
4:36 to 5:07  mother fucker I'm a vampire wow love it make a movie a book cover or a tv show out of those 2 actors well done my new fav video wish it was longer loll
100000000000/10 Awesome!!!
Wow. Just wow. That was amazing. Was not expecting that, I was expecting a drop like The Drug In Me Reimagined but I'm glad you didn't. R.I.P Derek Jones.
Fantastic scream, voice. God job. 👍
How'd I only just realised the reVAMPED pun
You should do a movie
WOOOOW
I've waited years for this
Muazzam muazzam
Play Speed 1.25x is also nice
Wow. That was fucking epic. Please more redone songs, this and the drug in me is reimagined sre just amazingly good
Revampired lol
Merinding asli
Someone give this man an award.... Nah make it a crown.
Literal chills. Hair raising shit dude. This is amazing. If i could sing i would scream along too.
ok cool lets bring goth back.
I normally like most of their songs but I think this sucks
A Blend of everything
This tells a better story then beauty and the beast who agrees ?
OMG I love this
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart,  Ludwig van Beethoven and Johann Sebastian Bach would have loved to work with you. Bravo Ronnie!
Waw
Dude like.... THIS IS HOW FUCKIN MUSIC SHOULD BE MADE. The voice, the editing, the cinematography, strings, all of it was so incredible composed
Im getting a new dracula movie vibes or the origins of twilight
I wasn't a falling in reverse fan, nor did I know much about them, I only came to watch this mv because I knew paige was in it. but oh my god I'm so glad I came here! this song is INSANE! ronnie was unbelievable!  so I'm basically a rock music fan and I love gothic/gothic rock music too so I just wanted to know is this the first time they've made a song like this or do they have more such gothic songs in their discography? (like I said, I have no idea what this band's sound is)
ONLY 1.5 MILLION IN 10 DAYS??? THIS IS A FUCKING TRAGEDY!
Just no words, beauty, epic, emotional ! 🤟🖤
Yes!!!! 😍 I so need a sink or swim reimagined ❤️❤️❤️
This. Is. Mindblowing!
Another awesome song be nice to hear a new version of "raised by wolves"
Who in the hell would dislike this?!?
This is ronnies world , we are just living in it
Escape The Fate will really really regret seeing this, Ronnie's been doing so fu***** tremendous!!! 👏👏👏👏
Hi my name is Ronnie, I'm an addict
I hate to say it I like this one way better than the original
Okay, Ronnie hits different whiteout tattoos.
this is amazing
Ngl. He kinda looks like a very young ozzy osbourne and it's unsettling.
Yes, just yes! 🤘🏼
This is fucking epic... holy shit.
Holy Ronnie! This was absolutely amazing!!!
is that Lady Dimitrescu from RE VIIlage?
My inner 16-year-old-me is losing her shit right now 😱🖤
She looks like the chick from Friday
Paige was stunning in this. What an insane video.
Where would you find a talented volturi like Ronnie...🤘🤘🤘
Unbelievable this is so amazing.
Goosebumps
Too bad he didn’t glimmer in the sunlight.
¡Me encanto!
Just a genuine question here. What can’t Ronnie do? Like he picks a genre and goes to the top. His talent is fucking endless
Ronnie is a genius. Most talented man I can think of....
Same
Please finish this TRILOGY...with a remake...or SHALL we say RETOOTHED...version of "RAISED BY WOLVES"...THEIR PHENOMENAL REIMAGINED.. REVAMPED ... counterparts... would be MUSICALLY  EPIC. PLEASE MAKE THIS HAPPEN RONNIE....CALL ROONEY NOW...!!!!!
Seeing Ronnie without tattoos is weeeeeeeird
Ronnie Dio and Ozzy have joined the chat
Another masterpiece. This man is talented.
full. body. chills.
*asking the mob* can you guys also sing?
I’m predicting the next song will be Raised By Wolves as a continuation of Popular Monster.
Yessss😍😍😍🖤🖤🖤
Ah I love Paige, and her work with Ronnie in this makes my heart explode 💕
🧛‍♂️😁👍❤
Ronnie would be THE most incredible Broadway singer, in the world. Ever. Period.
OMG your voice is perfect Ronnie...
I love this version, I love the original version as well so I cannot necessarily pick a favorite when it comes to only hearing the songs. The thing I love most about the revamped version is that you could hear how much effort was put into this as well as see it. I love the music video more for the revamped version than I do the original being as I love vampires and I think this video is so creative and just perfectly done!

Anything Ronnie touches turns to pure eargasim GOLD💯😘   FUCKIN AMAZING!!!
Well, I'm not a Falling In Reverse fan but I feel like one.
wow....
Can you just reImagine the whole drug in me is you album?
I'm usually not a big fan of this kind of metal, but this song really talked to me. Amazing work, song and honesty. Masterpiece.
A lot better than TDIMIY Revamped
If only Jonny Craig owned up to his addiction and turned around his life and career like this like Ronnie did, man we'd see two PHENOMENAL artists now.
At first I thought to myself "what a piece of shit" *laughs in death-metal* Then I got it, it's musical theatre! Pure musical. Phantom of the Opera style. Campy cool
Good to know that Ronnie hasn't become more dramatic over the years or anything
PAIGEEEE FHSJDJ
mt gay n gostei
THIS GAVE ME GOOSEBUMPS HOLY FUCK
Was gonna say "Hey it's Paige!" and then by god is this guy good! Turns from average band into opera rock star, moar please.
Drinking blood has proven to remove tattoo! hahaha
What a masterpiece... I never thought I could feel like I was fifteen again. To discover new tracks from bands who constantly rebuild themselves. Linkin Park & the other bands of the "Nu Metal" era introduced me to music. Before that, I was just listening. After that, I was living it. Thanks BMTH, Falling In Reverse to have created a new era like this current one. So powerful, so creative and so deep. What a wonderful piece of art. Falling In reverse is really amazing. Music is a friend you keep all your life, in bad and good moments. Thanks for the sharing of the emotion and the mighty energy.
Omg you do not understand how much this speaks to my soul! This specific album has been my favourite since it came out, but this new version might just take that place! This is absolutely magical!
It remembers Evanescence
The future is now
where did all his tattoos go
Again another great one from ronnie and saraya-jade (paige) looking stunning as always
Absolutely stunning!! And how amazing do both Ronnie and Paige look in that clothing?? Wow!
Morbius, anyone???
God i hope raised by wolves is next!  Feels like it should be..
Lmao the only thing I heard was "hii ronnieee"
holy shit
Wow 💚 I hope you revamp all of your older songs if they turn out this good. Well done this is an amazing rendition, love and respect 💚🇮🇪
Better than the first version 🖤
So ugly and poorly done ripoff of a Walmart brand Fabio movie.
Trash
Damn. Is that Paige ?
Dear Ronnie, My princess and I discovered FIR and we love so many of your songs. But when we listened to "The Drug In Me Is Reimagined" and "I'm Not A Vampire (Revamped)", you definitely got us. Every time we watch these videos, we are amazed by the beauty and romanticism that you instilled in these short films. We both happen to be also great fans of Motionless In White, and we were just thinking that it would be so wonderful if you and Chris Motionless could make a song or more together 😍😍 and also a song with Maria Brink from In This Moment 😍😍 Please we know that you have a busy agenda, but we sincerely hope that you will take the time to consider this request.  Take great care of you, and our greetings to Paige and Willow.  With all our love, Yazid & Bianka 🌹🌹
I expect another revamped/reimaged song approx 12th/13th Feb 2022.
Now that was some dramatic remake 😂
OH MY GOD THIS IS AMAZING. PLEASE NEVER STOP REDOING THESE OLD FIR SONGS LIKE THIS. I LOVE THIS SO MUCH
Oh my goodness 🖤 I remember listening to this song back in middle school. Hearing it like this is just amazing
Horrible arrangement. This video was a complete and utter cringefest.
Love to see that the Grey Beards came down from Skyrim to help Ronnie turn an amazing song into a masterpiece
I started falling in love with falling in reverse
Falling in Reverse has been an incredible part of my life for so long. My sister let me listen to her ipod in 2008, when I was 5 years old, and I've been following their music ever since.
❤❤❤❤
I knew this song is going to be popular! I know it!
revamped... haha... i get it lol  but no seriously these reimagined versions of old songs are fucking masterpieces
I didn't know you, now I'm in love with you and this song.
A living LEGEND.
It really sucks that Derek's gone.  He had a different kinda chemistry that made him such an amazing person. Crazy to think that it's almost been a year since.
rip Derek... may he rest in piece <3
This is epic and I’m not even a falling in reverse fan
"Если дом там, где сердце, Значит моё сердце потеряло все надежды..."  Сильно. Вот вроде смотришь, все коммерческие проекты, но нечто человеческое осталось. Наверное. Видео выше всяких похвал. Хорошая актерская игра, музыка, вокал просто бесподобны. Спасибо!
this is such a masterpiece but i cant get over that he kept the i feel like a lady that is pregananant line fsjaklfhsjk;fgasjk;f
H O L Y S H I T
Ronnie you make me cry
This is so so so so goood i have no word how to say this. And Ronnie indeed looks like a vampire
Very creative and different, I fucking love it!
Amazing Artist. 🎨 ❤
This video is absolutely stunning and I'm living for it!
I would love to see Popular Monster Reawaken too
perfection
este man sabe superarse . rip derek
This brought me to tears, involuntary.
gonna cry
fuck this takes me back. I wish i could do it all again.
🤦‍♂️
This is litterally the best thing ive heard in a long time sooo goooodddd n i thought the first version was good this is is like yessssss
Lets not beat around the bush. This is pretty fucking good isnt it 🦇
Okay, yass.
The Drug In Me Is Reimagined - "Oh, is he...is he a vampire?"  I'm Not A Vampire Revamped - "Oh, he's definitely a vampire."
The best thing that i ever seen before, epic! 🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻
I don't know what people are going on about here. For me this a story. Paige is not her real name it's her WWE name. In the story she is represented metaphorically and somewhat real life and somewhat ironically. That's my understanding. As far as the original song and this one it's just a continuation as far as I'm concerned. Ronnie and everyone that works with him are artistic geniuses from my perspective. Keep doing it and don't rush the artistic process. ❤️
Как же красиво Ронни кричит
This is the most incredible thing to come from Ronnie’s mind!
I love this Version so much!! The video is amazing!!

MY EARS HAVE BEEN BLESSED THIS IS SO FUCKING BEAUTIFUL
This is terrible, the video and the song and the vocals 👎
Damn son. I don't want to be vampire if im gonna die that way.
How much make up yall use to cover up all that art work?
This dude is a genius..... I'm 51 years old and it's one of my all time favorite bands.
Wow Is the same house of Tonight is the night i die of Palaye Royale ? :0
Aww damn I was expecting him to just slaughter all those villagers that broke into his home
@ 5:06 is when the song becomes literally the best rock song ever
This is the second of your songs that I preferred the gothic reinterpretation vs the original
What if Ronnie puts together a full Vampire Music Video Story arch, working backwards, ending in this song and then having "the drug in me is reimagined" as an epilogue.....That'd be sick.
Ronnie never disappoints.
It took me too long to realize HIS FACE TATTOOS WERE COVERED
So awesome he's even got the grey beards for back up vocals...
Wow bro.  Unbelievable, again.  Well done. 💪🔥💪🔥💪🔥💪🔥💪🔥💪🔥💪🔥💪
Paige is perfect here lol and I love the reference to TVD in there lol
I have watched this too many times since it came out, and I still can't think of words to express how much I liked it. It was just...good. In an inexplicable way. Thank you.
I could watch this video all day long, still in love with the song and video 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
HOLY FUCK
This is amazing!!!
is that a wig or is his hair that long ?? what a banger revamp
don't mind me, I'm just waiting for vampire Ronnie and werewolf Ronnie to duke it out
That was a masterpiece
Holy shit that was insane. I would definitely watch a full length movie based on this
Unreal.
Meh =P
One of my favourite songs of all time
Hi my name is Bobby, I'm an addict.  Thank you for sharing Ronnie.
Does anyone else see paige from wwe 0:30
This guys deserve everything,  Back then when he going to jail , everyone throw hate on him , he lost all his friend who the one is trust the most,  past is past but remain forever ..
Love this. love the emotions that he puts into the lyrics. the video is amazing as well.
♡♡Luv your versatile voice ♡♡ Proud of you. You have come long way.
Yes yes yes yes Ronnie through all the years I have followed you through your career there has never been a moment of doubt in your talent!!! I love these they keep getting better and better! I love you
🦾👍
I love all of these.  I hope there will be more "reimagined", "revamped"...recreational pieces.
Excuse me while I cry. This was just so damned beautifully done!
Ronnie se ve hermoso 💖
From a banger to another one... That's so good, I love that version sooo much Thank you
A true artist still young and should go into acting he will do real good.
Why does he give me vanya from the umbrella academy vibes
Wow didn't see that in him!
RONNIE YOU ARE A GOD MATE, THIS IS FUCKING ART ❤  Loving this band so much, please never stop. Been following you since ETF and you never dissapoint 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼
Bloody brilliant! Ronnie is a modern day Freddy Mercury! I’ve no bloody doubt Freddy would be Ronnie’s biggest fucking fan! Epic!
I feel like I just got whiplash
ok i just realized i am fullout in love with ronnie in this video
I think you need to do musicals. Haha. The emotion and power in your voice and your creativity would do amazingly well. Your revamps amaze me so much 😍😍
the vocals are even better than the original
This is fucking awful
Literally speechless it’s fuckin beautiful
Wow! I love this version too! Amazing and beautiful
👌
I've had this on repeat since it dropped! Somebody..anybody help! I cant stop! The production..Ronnie my boy, you need to be in movies..make a movie please! You're a God amongst men. All I can say! Total masterpiece! The voice, The power, the " you've got it all my boy! Wishing you the best! I'm sorry for the loss of Derek. He will always be remembered and cherished! My thoughts are with you during this. Much love and well wishes!
This is the most beautiful music video I have ever seen.
this is so dramatic lmao i like it tho
Whooa.  Ronnie since you're on a bender with these revamps.... How about a whole album of this style of original music.  I'm down...anyone else?
so damn good holy
Next up: *The Bitter End Revisited* .....?
Thats incredible,  it gave chills, these re-recorded this songs give me all the feels, makes them get a deeper meaning
Anyone else have a crush on Ronnie as a vampire or is it just me
That's Paige
Thank you for this song
Que chimba ronnie es el mejor
THIS IS A FUCK MASTERPIECE
1 week and I'm still crying 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
This song is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
If only Bram Stoker was alive today to see the legacy his work created
Ronnie developing Symphonic Metalcore. Cool.
this is just fucking awful it sounds like the dude from the used after getting kicked in the nuts
i like :>
Paige is jus so freaking beautiful 😍
bro this is a movie wtf
Dis is so 2008
Omg I just got the title of the song. Re-VAMPED lol. Minds blown for a week.
I love it so much nostalgic somehow and hysterical adore
Such an epic performance from Ronnie. Amazing video. Ridiculously under rated vocalist. Fucking amazing dude. 👏
Only few people in this world are able to connect me to their feelings. Ronnie you are a genius and you have all my respect.
I realy dont like the part from 5:00 - 5:30 but the rest is perfect.
6:16 rest in peace ❤️
So corny.
Goddamit Ronnie and Saraya got me like one big goosebump!!!!!
I got chills listening to this well done falling in reverse
Should just put out this type of stuff every so often, fucking beautiful every second.
Bruh...amazing
Edgy Josh Groban
"Raised by Wolves (Rewolfed)" should be next))
This made me feel so many things at once, I just started crying
How much budget went on this ? Holy shit !
This... This is absolutely mesmerizing
Is that Paige ?
dreams come true
Ronnies vocals are just so perfect
im like oml i need whole album of just remastered songs fricken masterpiece😍😍😍
Twilight
the place reminds me to the place palaye royale made tonight is the night I die
5:05 is like Camilo sesto in Jesús superstar.
This video is  pure art.
Throughout this video, the one thing that I can stop thinking about is, "What happened to all of his tattoos? Didn't he have some on his forehead and arms?
No one:  Ronnie: "LeT's SiNg OuR oLd SoNgS iN a DiFfErEnT gEnRe!"
this is a cinematic masterpiece :D
Paige was amazing ronnie killed this
Ronnie and maria brink the vampire and the werewolf. They should do hunting grounds together
Wow effect). Great song, very addictive storyline, wow!)
Oh.... no 😬
JAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJA
I head banged and raged when this song released as a teenager  Now as an adult I can sit back and let this play over   I love this man and both versions  First release is like shots, this is like sipping slowly and chilling
Meh...
i felt like when we was in front of the sun he would burn all the makeup and stay hes real self with all the tattos .
Just amazing♡
Wow....
Didn't notice Paige for a minute lol
Cant..... Stop...... Listening.......
I think we found our Lestat if they plan on redoing the Anne Rice novels into films
I love that we grew up and this band is growing with us
AMAZING
Epic 🔥 🔥 🔥
the revamped  part of the title is amazing the pun is awesome
Wonderful,just wonderful!! I relate to this so much as well.
fuckin banger!
So...just realized why it is called re'vamped' lmao
This is up there with Disturbed's Sound Of Silence
''This is a movie! This is a frickin' movie! This is a movie.''- Too LIT Mafia quote. I agree.
outstanding, Ronnie.... You're fuckin' Genius
Re''vamp''ed...i c wat u done there 😉
I have never had this many goosebums and feels in my whole entire life wtf this was beautiful i dont have words just wow WOW what just happened!
This gives me goosebumps! Also brings back good vibes from the used to be band Vampires Everywhere
The song is very good. There better be subse writing.Paige is very beautiful
Really well done!!! All songs should be done this way!!! 😃 😃 😃 😃
Metal opera has never been so enticing
And then..next ronnie would REDIAL the song PICK UP THE PHONE..🤣🤣
Incredible work team.
Such a romantic song, made so many cry like me lol, and fricking Ronnie, my dude has an amazing voice, just wow!
5:42 FKING AMAZING!!
Ahhhhh Revamped... I see what you did there 😂
Sounds good.
This is a true cinematic masterpiece. Ronnie did an amazing job on this and Paige gets even more gorgeous by the minute
I was waiting for something in 2021. Not disappointed at all. Loved it!!!
My life in 6 minutes. Haha.
"So I sharpenened my teeth". Not everyday you get these lyrics in a song
Is that Davey Havok?
Good for Rodney  I love this style side of him
Idk how... but i can feel everything ... which is just not normal with Borderline
Ronnie: I'm not a vampire.. Me: You really believe that?
Holy shit
To be maladjusted to a toxic environment is not the same as being defective.
Omg wwe superstar Paige is in it 😱😱
raised by wolves like this... just imagine it
Can we talk about how amazing Paige was in this?! ♥
netflix was getting old, so i started this movie, so far so amazing!
✌❤💪⚡
R.I.P Derek forever!!!!
wondering if any of this was inspired by Dracula 2000 because I watched it YEARS ago, forgot it existed and for some reason watching this reminded me of it for some reason? also think i see some references to dark shadows and/or interview with the vampire
Absolutely beautiful and epic!
Watched this at least once an hour
"If home is where My Heart is... Then My Heart has lost all hope."    The video hit my daughter and me a lot harder when we (possibly read too much into it and) realized he might be referring to her directly as His Heart. *Sigh* Each time those lyrics came through something pretty hopeless feeling happens to her (seeing him bury a body, returning home and hearing the gunshot, and then... being home (alone) as the sunrise takes them both).   Damn.   So perfectly bittersweet <3
Wow! This was 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥. An he looks so healthy these days. 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🙌🏾
Jesus is with you bro you just have to want him
Bert McCracken has met his match.
Well, fuck! Now I want a whole opera, Ronnie
If operas were like this, i would actually enjoy going to one. This is incredible!
Ronnies Voice is the best I’ve ever heard....his artistic talent is unbelievable....I don’t think he could sing a bad song!!! 10/10 Again!!!
Pretty sure this song is from the dracula play in forgetting sarah marshall...
This is incrediblen!!!!
I’ve watched this like 5 times today
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 I love this shit like omg
No offense but this is more better
I love this song
DAMN!
What a masterpiece, I'm dumbfounded 🤯🤩
RIP Derek Jones and Christina Cetta  ...HI RONNIE!!!!!!!  It's literally insane that the same lyrics can hit so incredibly different. That's a talent beyond compare. Then he adds all that vocal range....This man is Immortal.
This mans voice gives me fucking goosebumps beyond belief. I was literally holding my chest the entire video. Everything about this is beautiful. The cinematography, the composition was *ethereal* asf, the story it gave, his voice and the emotion, the orchestra and opera feel, the fucking power. Like wow he really *did that* !
Wow, Ronnie you're a legend. 👹
Omg... 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
This is my favorite vampire movie of all time.
Can someone do an edit with this song and with Klaus from TVD? Would be fucking dope
Ronnie is so talented! Hope he doesn't stop!
2:24
This isn't a music video it's a beautiful short Movie.
Tell me why he look like Tommy Weisu
STELLAAAAA
So this is what they do when they're not suing Carti
holy fuck this was EPIC, I definitely did not expect  that when clicking on the thumbnail haha
Is it me or has his voice gotten even better? Like holy shit.
In loving memory of Derek Jones 💔 🙏
Ronnie is amazing... Epic
3:51 the vocals just make me want to cry. I've always loved this song but this remake is on another level entirely....the raw emotion that comes through on these notes  hits me in the heart
E P I C
Beautiful ❤️
Love this song
My god ! I loved this so much from Paige to the whole song love it !!! You did it again Ronnie
This made me emotional and I don’t know why. I’ve been so numb recently.
Whoever disliked this has no taste.
I love this Version of the song like shit gave me LITERAL chills down my spine but I’ll always love the OG. But damn I live the creativity that was put in this video like it’s such a beautiful masterpiece
you brilliant bastard! This was an amazing watch.
They tried to stone me but it didn't work
Ronnie out here flexing with all these piano remakes.
Este hombre no se cansa de regalarnos arte <3
I honestly Love this song It's a masterpiece
this was BEYOND incredible
The gold eyes he has and her red eyes seem like a reference to breaking dawn
Chills literal chills
Are these and the popular monster video all intertwined?
Ronnie almost looks like early Davey havok
T uma bosta
So we're really getting an album ❤️
this was a spiritual experience JENDJJAKEKS
He is the God of music. So talented. He is our gift
Is that girl paige she looks like her
It's so beautiful 😢
😍
This was just a cheesy musical essentially.  And god dammit, I love it.
..I...I Can't even.. :o SPEECHLESS
His vocals in this literally give me goosebumps. This is a masterpiece. I really hope to hear more recreations of classic FIR songs. ❤️
This is garbage
Ronnie trying out for Ice Nine Kills?? Lmao still jokes aside this was cool but serious wanna be INK vibes
King of the music scene
WoW this is as if I was looking at a movie !! I love it it is now one of my favourite
This...this right here... Pure Definition of Epic. Well done.
was not expecting to hear something like this today Wow I love it
i really don't like fir but holy shit. this is amazing.
Absolutely stunning!
holy shit!!!!!!!!!
Did anyone really excited when they saw Paige in the video?? 🖤❤🖤
amaizing job , what a incredible voice ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡
Ronnie is G.O.A.T.
G O O S E B U M P S
This is a fucking masterpiece
Paige?
I need Falling in reverse in my life💖💖 Forever and always
i wanna see and hear my all time favorite song since 2006 when i was highschool the day this song came out "Not Good Enough For Truth In Cliche" hope you will do revamped also and the situations
the "in loving memory of derek jones" sign makes me cry everytime i think about that song and mv
this was so beautiful I'm speechless I could definitely see this as a movie and honestly was amazing
Ronnie's voice is so unbelievable
What a song and what a video, whow, I'm impressed 😱 Masterpice 😲🔥🔥🔥🔥
Slowing your song and playing a piano doesn’t work with all your songs. Should’ve just stayed with the drug in me is you.
Who came here because WWE's Paige?  But bruh, this is masterpiece.
Okay but I love that he actually sings so good!! Like he doesn't just rely on the screaming bits. This is amazing!
I got like an interview with a vampire vibe from this love it
Always nothing shy of what we label to be called Perfection, or at least the closest thing. It's an overwhelming Orgasm to the eardrums. From the start to the finish a captivating exploitation of sheer genius and beauty. Genuinely appreciate how he indulges himself so passionately to fill every void, nook and cranny of our deepest darkest desires. And Saraya, what an absolute Goddess in her own right. Brilliantly done.
I'll tell my kids that this is Twilight
On first listen the beginning doesn't sound right and it's nothing compared to The Drug in Me is Reimagined. I ca tell that I will like it after a few listens
As fan of falling in reverse hen i first heard this song in the original since 2011 i was in college in that day i never knew the deeper meaning of this lyrics until now when i heard this masterpiece today damn i feel goosebumps man ronnie radke proves that he can do everything not just metal or hardcore he can do this the pure dominant of his voice and rage is pure magical since before when he created the band called escape the fate and something he got jailed and when he got out he created this song and the drug is me not you im glad in todays era he can create something that we never seen and seen before hearing this i show my respect to ronnie and to his band but seeing this masterpiece of the genius ronnie create i wanna see the queen of damned remake and make this a official them or soundtrack to this song make this happen  ronnie
Oh. My. Gawwwwwwwwwwwwwwww. I feel like I just went through an emotional rollercoaster, I was like "surely this can't be as good as the new version of The Drug in Me"........boy was I wrong
Incredible!
I watch this at least 5 times a day
Very few music groups or entertainers bring an entire package. Maybe the song will be great or the video will be interesting, but it's not often you find entertainers that actually bring an entire package. Ronnie Radke is a guy who has spent this time away from touring just being about as creative as possible. It really is amazing to watch the growth of him as an artist and performer.
This makes me think of Lord of the Lost's "Lighthouse" song.
Still not sure how to feel about this
Ronnie like u from Russia 🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺!!!
I love it. ♥️
Em 4:58 é a hora do choro
OMFG !!
Yo is that Paige!? She's absolutely smoking in this video.
goosebumps. chills
Good fucking song and video no cap 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯👍
Liar. Liar. Pants on fire. You are, you are A vampyre...   ♥️🥀🌄
This is beautifull🥰
THIS WAS SO GOOD
Ronnie always kills it, his vocals are amazing.
My heart is racing...I'm just...😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😈😈😈😈😈😈😈🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤 hell yes. Hell yes to ever part of this. That was so intense. 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏💋💋💋💋💋☠😈🖤
its.... SO GOOOOOOOOOOOOD
I would almost kill to see a video done for Carry On dedicated to Derek
This is a true masterpiece I listen to it everyday I can't completely start my day without it
I have been a lifetime fan of rock and Falling in Reverse. And this is a masterpiece. I have listened to them since I was a kid playing rock band with my older brothers. And I swear Ronnie Radke, you are legendary.
That's real symphonic metalcore song
This was fucking badass
I love this one way better then the drug in me is you reimagined oh Ronnie killed this 🔥🔥 I love his voice
The girl in this vid looks like an alive version of Emily from Corpse Bride.
My dad died yesterday after almost a month in the hospital. I’m so sad he’ll never get to hear this amazing piece 😢💔
1:54 bro.... 🥶
Ronnie is literally SO TALENTED I don’t know how else to put it...SO MUCH EFFORT and it turned out GREAT 👏👏
Love how u put Paige in this too man 🖤
Just wow
but the production though
My 20 years old emosocialized self when she heard the original version...F*ck, this is my style!!! My 30 years old self after heard this version....Holy sh*t, this is magic!! :o 💜
On the side bar in this video I see a lot of reacts to this song, I feel like they cheapen the whole song. I love the two new songs the artist made out of his old songs though.
paige <3
Paige is a great actress
Anyone know why he deleted all his IG posts?
I need western or raised by wolves done like this ASAP
This song is absolute perfection! Though I must say, for me, the most beautiful thing I've ever heard comes at 4:20 to 5:10
Man, 3:50 - 4:20 is fucking perfect!! This is an incredible remake.
It’s been a while since I listened to falling in reverse. So long in fact that this didn’t even sound like Ronnie to me until about 1:45 seconds in.
It's like Falling In Reverse and Type O Negative had a collab.
People : you can’t outdo drug in me is reimagined Ronnie : hold my chalice
So much better than twilight.
Wow... just wow this is so beautiful.
You're insane Ronnie and I feel it in my bones every times you sing, I'm so glad you guys reach this level of maturity to emphase these lyrics this way, amasing work
I swear to God if ronnie is not the next one to portray Dracula or another main vampire in whatever series. We need to burn down hollywood
Rest In Peace Derek. A fitting piece for an amazing set of stories to be told through the ages. We love you Ronnie and all members of Falling In Reverse. 🖤
Ronnie, FIR, please continue to put out versions of these 😍
I've been waiting for this for a while
Ronnie's talent is endless ...
Ronnie it’s the closest that a Rock or Hard Rock or Metal artist could be to Mozart. His Operatic Rock is a new side of the already diversified FiR with they’re Rap style. I hope Ronnie continues to Reimagine and Revamp more of his previous creations into a new full album. You should get a speech ready because you’ll win a Grammy soon or even an Oscar if you create a soundtrack. Your Portuguese ancestry and English Girlfriend in the video reveals a lot of the European in you and I hope to watch FiR in London one day.
Ronnie Ronnie Ronnie   I love this 🥰
Honestly Epitaph, I'm pretty sure Ronnie is half your fan base. Even if not I'm definitely following you because of him mainly. You have yourselves a legend
You can't be successful in every genre Ronnie: Hold my Soda
I was not expecting that
just remake the whole album PLEASE 😭😭
J'en ai la chair de poule c'est tellement magique. Un chef-d'oeuvre   merci
HOLY HELL. This is a masterpiece. Straight on repeat. WOW.
12out of 10. Standing ovation!!!!!!
This is everything. I honestly love this song and know that the younger version of me who used to play Falling in Reverse in the car non-stop during high school would've LOVED this. Thank you for another beautiful piece.
Can we take an hour to appreciate the beauty of Paige
Please this was so beautifully madeeee, love the idea though!
So, As It Is released a reimagined version of their album The Great Depression a year or so ago. Could this be inspired by it?
13 YEAR OLD ME IS SCREAMING
Simply a masterpiece
That's what I call pure art
The more I watch this incredible video it reminds me off Michael Jackson plz forgive me if anyone on here doesn't like Michael Jackson but the song call Earth by Michael Jackson reminds me off this song they both have amazing voices i would live falling in reverse to do a remake of earth by Michael Jackson but in a heavy slow version like drug in me is u that would hit sky high coz what the world going through now would just be amazing hope you guys agree with me let's try to get that to happen guys 🤘
Ronnie just keeps getting better and better
And that's how you make a breakdown without a breakdown. This is fckn masterpiece🤯
Omg omg i just found out that they are dating in real life i am so late.
this revamped version is pretty Dope, definitely adding this to my Pandora 😊
they should release an album full of remake like this one and "the drug in me"
BRAVO.. amazinggggg :O  ....
God damn, pardon my french but this is a damn fucking well directed MOVIE. Ups to Ronnie for surprising us with another legendary masterpiece of a revamp of an already amazing song.
This was cool and awesome.
Gragolandia??
Has ronnie got vocal surgery yet for screaming
I love this Song! 🤘 I got instant Chills! 🤘 So fucking Amazing Song! 🤘 So Insane! 🤘 this is a Masterpiece 🤘 i love it! 🤘 it sounds so Amazing/Beautiful ! 🤘
When you date hookers you turn cold
otras personas: como odio los anuncios, me joden un monton youtube: **me pone un anuncio**  yo: >:c youtube: **es una cancion de 4 aminutos** yo: :D
Is he transitioning into a woman / when you date hookers they turn you into one like bruce jenner
My heart is broken now. It’s a fucking masterpiece. <3 <3 <3
el comentario en español que buscabas UwU
Yaaaaasss!!! This is so epic!!
Wow. Gänsehaut 🤩
Loki 2.0
Wow SO good. Ronnie's evolution & growth as a vocalist & artist is staggering. Big props to Sean Rooney as well for another amazing piano composition & performance. Ronnie & Sean are a beyond epic musical team. Looking fwd to more...
Don't get me wrong I love this band, in my opinion this is kinda ruining his previous success. Are they running out of ideas? Falling in Reverse I love makes you want to head band till you drop with heavy instrumentals and either a badboy song about girls or something meanful and deep.
He kinda looks like loki (Thor's brother)
One word : Amazing congratz.....
I'm crying, man this is new era of arthouse music!!!!! Amazing👍👍💵
boyz obviously watched an interview with a vampire
Derek Jones - Rest in Peace Brother
Best music video
Truly one of the most beautiful things i´ve ever heard/watched! Love this!!!
Definitely need to make an album of all these revamped and re-imagined songs!!! I’d 1000% buy it
My first thought was....wow, Ronnie looks different! Then it clicked that his tattoos are gone. Mad respect for the attention to details and the amazing music.
Epic
3:40 my favourite part! amazing voice!
OH MY GOSH HIS VOICE!!!
Wow.. never saw this coming.
This is just.. A MASTERPIECE. I'm in love with it 😭❤
best movie release of 2021
I couldn't believe what I had just heard. It was a mental orgasm. I immediately sent this to my friend and he also was in shock that something so beautiful could be made. We both said our lives would be complete if they did Caught Like A Fly Reimagined.
The original is great. This... This is just fucking weird.
This is a band I would listen to if they was on, never disliked them and then I heard this.... just wow A top quality piece of music right here
I can't stop listening to this
who else is thinking of a creative way to rename a good girls bad guys remake?
wow!
Make more REMAKE PLEASE!!!!!
Everything about this was PERFECT!! 2021 may have just started but this right here.. this is MY song of the YEAR. 👏
I'm in love with this masterpiece!!!
La voz de Ronnie me encanta, la está explotando tan bien últimamente que es satisfactorio...
Please do more versions
I CAN'T STOP REPLAYING THIS
Jesus that ending ronnie
You are immortal Ronnie Radke.
what a fucking masterpiece.....
The first "heart has lost all" at 5:34. Ronnie hit myles kennedy notes. Or is that just me
Omg Ronnie plays a good vampire 😍
chemical dAaAaAAZeD! anybody else? lmaooo ronnie is the man
heehehehe gwaaapooooo gago
U can feel every emotion it's top notch
So damn cool
Ronnie you are such a genius!! To say that I am obsessed with this is such an understatement.
YES YES YES YES YES YES!!!!!!!! THIS IS WHAT WE NEEDED!!!!!!!!! I fucking love it !!
Nice
Where’s the rock?
This man is a fucking genius!
Woah.... this was mad heat. Good job, Ronnie!
EPIC
what you are doing is beautiful Ronnie. Keep it up mate! I am loving every second!
Anyone else get chills or am I feeling the cold?
I feel like we're all so privileged to watch Ronnie's growth and evolution.  And it's priceless.
Omg Ronnies so cute here
So look, love ronnie, love falling in reverse, but...wth? I liked the song but was expecting harder. We see your range ronnie, but drop something hard. You have the ability to merge genres at will. Do it.
Anyone else watched this uh...how many times...already? Just me? Oh...
Okay but no one going to mention the veerryyyy end??? “In loving memory of Derek Jones”. I think this is something him and Derek might have talked about and put together before Dereks death, maybe they weren’t gonna do it or maybe they were who knows but I believe Ronnie did this video like this because somewhere along the way Derek helped him with it. I love that he mentioned Derek. R.I.P.
I also love Black Sabbith, Ronnie..
I love you paige🌹💯
He got Paige in the video hell yeah
i love itt xD
this looks like the diary of jane xD jajaja
Is that the girl from the friday video lol
Ronnie Radke vs The Cullens lol but this is just amazing 👌🏼🔥💯 well done Ronnie just wow
,😍
🖤
vamooooo huachipato, vamoooo los pibeeeeee, el piberio, la gentusa.
There are some heavy Bonnie Tyler influences in this masterpiece and I am LIVING FOR IT. Jesus christ. So good.  https://youtu.be/lcOxhH8N3Bo
Is that voice piercing anybody else's soul or just me?
3:51 you're welcome
This was epic!
This dude took an angsty emo rock anthem and turned it into a full on Christopher Nolan cinematic like experience. The level of talent is just stupid. Bravo Ronnie. Bravo 👏
When i was junior highschool, i'm not vampire it's my first song i was covered for school festival. It's amazing when it's revamped to a classic ah i got goosebump
Please keep reviving my childhood like this
Amazing!
I’m going to die I love this so much. 🥴🥴🥴 3:53 just omg chills
I really entonces this new versions!!!! Thanks FIR
I've lost count how many times I've listened to this so far. This is literally THE song getting me through a breakup.
wow
Such a underrated masterpiece.
This is fucking epic. Love that you are listening to the fans. Amazing and artistic.
@3:50 my jaw was dropped so hard when he started singing!
I think now Ronnie would be able to turn Good Girls Bad Guys into a song that would bring a little tear to one eye
I believe Ronnie needs to produce for Tim Burton.
Amazing vis as well. He is like Louie from interview w the vampire.  He feels love
After watching this videona few times (as well as reaction videos because i love 'em) there is one part that i question. When Paige is cleaning blood is it from a kill (vampire) or a miscarriage (therefore actually human). No smear of blood or body plus his distance from the scene and situation has me leaning towards a lost child.
His voice. Whenbhebsays my head is always spinning.....then when screams. He is so tall in so many ways.  His voice is so much control om all his verses.
Ronnie just killed that fucking shit. 🔥💯
His voice control amazing.  Also I love the changes in voice so much talent.  N video is amazing
This shit was insane, but it's fucking awesome
Eh...? but you're not a vampire, you're a just a person, treating people like sheet and creating illusions to justify it, then making melodramatic songs bragging about it...enjoy the emptiness
Ronnie is truly slept on. The raw talent in his voice is amazing. Not to mention the masterpiece of a video. Those that helped create this deserve an award of some kind because DAMN
How does this have 1.6k dislikes ?😂
okay, this is epic !
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Yes yes and fucking yes I've been wanting this since you did the drug in me
cuando un maldito album!!??
so like. how long do yall think it took for them to cover up all of his tattoos
I have goosebumps!! This is amazing.. love it
This deserves an Oscar
The way the songs grew up immaculately with my music taste
Well that song blows
Hes just shining on on um now...
the harmony part when he says hi my name is ronnie i’m an addict and that last high “hope” give me chills every time fr
Well that was fucking epic!
@5:03 me every single day in 2008/2009 obsessed with Twilight. 😂 I'm sorry, I had to, but also this is fucking stunning and I am so here for Ronnie reimagining more of his songs like this because DAMN 😍
This is just an absolute masterpiece I cant get enough of this its amazing!! Just pulls u in with every verse and there hasn't been a song like that in a min.
I really love the revamp on this video Ronnie and Page are such a great fit together...
he is not a vampire he looks like loki from marvel
It's not the same without Jacky Vincent
OMG Paige <3
Que emotivo... Até chorei aqui  Muito bom mesmo ❤️
Paige❤️
Hi Paige!!!!
I already saw the video. And now I'm going to watch all the react's.  So long. 😃  (Diego here, in another youtube account__Brazil/Brasil)  Ainda bem que eu já vi ao vivo no Rio de Janeiro. Mas vou comprar esses dois shows online tb.
This is literally the best song I've heard in a long time. Fuckin amazing
Damn. Just damn. That was breathtaking!
Is this an audition to be on the soundtrack of the next Twilight movie??
I like how youtubers are really hopping on this reaction train to this song
Literally the best artist ever!!! Has such an amazing voice that’s so unreal. Watching the growth since 2004 just amazing! Keep doing what you’re doing. You never disappoint always become better and better.
This is paige wwe
Ronnie is a rock god
Just when you think you could hold it together while listening to him sing, he releases something like this... *Dramatically falls over in pure bliss*
You should sing it mommy raised me on black sabith some times
Bruh his music videos are straight insane now 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
this makes me like falling in reverse even more now
2:25 . Ronnie I love you
EPIC
Raised By Wolves Reimagined ?
Stop being so damn talented
Daz black  really needs to react to this he’s going to be blown away with this masterpiece xx
Been a big fan of Ronnie's since the escape the fate days and musically this might just be the best thing he's ever put out. And with how good his past stuff is, that means a hell of a lot
😱😱😱👏👏👏🖤🔥🤘 x (💯)!
Amazing ronny amazing
This song is really good I like the beat he has a really good voice I had a really good beat to it sounds awesome I hope you guys make more songs and really creative

Im pretty sure I've listened to this over a thousand times already 😅
I relate to this in a totally different way and dimension so to speak. The girl in this looks a lot like someone I lost due to a drug overdose. I miss her loads! Can't stop listening to this!
That music video had me on the edge of my seat!!!!! I love that he committed to the character and had the tattoos covered!!
OMG RONNIE STOP THIS IS SO GOOD WHAT-

Hooked
I'm hookef
In memory of my beloved best friend, Amira. This is for you. I know how much you were obsessed with Falling In Reverse. You were supposed to be here to watch this with us, and I am sorry this came out two weeks after you passed away. I know you would have REALLY ate this up. So we enjoyed it on your behalf. Rest In Peace, my beautiful vampire.
Thank you for bringing us this beautifully crafted theatrical experience.
RIP Derek. You'll always be a true legend.
Every time I hear this song, I wish I was in the studio when it was recorded to feel the feeling there live. this is the best song from falling in reverse without a doubt
No words. 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Is this still at one million after a week?! Come on, show some masterpiece stuff to your friends!
Holy shit 🔥🔥🔥
Am i the only who thought it was paige!?
This is the most dramatic shit I’ve ever seen Especially since the og video is a celebrity rehab
Speechless!!!!!!!! Absolutely awesome
Absolutely love this! I follow this guy who reacts to music and I just have to share him reacting to this it’s so wholesome and funny and I think Ronnie would love his reaction! Lol https://youtu.be/9VoHIpK7s7I
this is the best music video of the year, and its only february, just fucking wow, im impressed, RIP Derek Jones
If they don't turn this into a god damn full length movie... I'll be heartbroken
The title is wrong, He is a vampire tsk tsk
..................... I-
For Derek ❤️ I love it.
..How much EPIC you want?  Falling in Reverse: YES!
Creative AF! Def has that Bohemian Rhapsody - Queen vibe
*sigh* another song to learn...it's not like I enjoy learning them or anything...
big Professor Snape vibes
My one and only criticism is that I wish the screaming section had more of a growl to it instead of just scream/screeching. The rest of the song is absolutely beautiful. Typical Ronnie blowing away everyone’s expectations 👏👍👌
Who the fuck 1,500 people who decided to dislike that masterpiece?
IVE BEEN WAITING
The nostalgia is so strong with this one
Paige are you ok
Ronnie please put the tattoos back
Paige doesn't need to wear too much makeup!! she's naturally beautiful ;)
I love the original so much I can't ever shut up while listening but this... this made me sit without any movement the whole video. Holy fuck this is so good, so beautiful
I'm not a revampire but i feel like one
Great music, great composition, great storyline, great theatrics, and good god Ronnie’s become one of the wonders of the world.. his vocal control and ability to manipulate it is amazing..
Love love love this!
Wow he looks awesome with his  costume
This is an absolute masterpiece
Great song but honestly this song didn't hit the mark for me like the other remakes did. It's good but just wasn't as into this one
Didn't think I'd wake up to have my heart shattered, but damn, I felt your heartache. Amazing performance, fantastic storytelling. This song is a serious gem.
Lyrics Revamped Version 🧛🏻  Well, I'm not a vampire, but I feel like one. Sometimes I sleep all day, 'cause I hate the sunlight. My hands are always shaking Body's always aching and the dark is when I feed. Well, I can lure any woman that I want to in my bed with me.   And whiskey seems to be my holy water And mothers, better lock your doors and hide your daughters.  'Cause I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones. Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold? For goodness sakes, where is my self-control? If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all hope.  Well, I'm not a zombie, but I feel like one today. Self-induced comatose, chemical daze. My head is always spinning from this dizzy blurry vision and my stomach has had enough. I feel like a lady that is pregnant with a baby, 'cause I'm always throwing up.  And hi, my name is Ronnie, I'm an addict. And daddy should've never raised me on Black Sabbath.  I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones. Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold? For goodness sakes, where is my self-control? If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all hope.  When will you mortals believe? (He's not a vampire) I just want the world to bleed (He's not a vampire) Lust at the sight of your blood (He's not a vampire) I swear to God, I am not a- (He is not a-) (He is not a-)  So God bless all of you now 'Cause I'm going straight to Hell (Straight to Hell) And I'm taking you down with me Because you know damn well  So I sharpen my teeth, 'cause I love the way it feels When I sink into your skin and draw the only thing that's real. You don't believe me, should I write it in blood? You better drive that fucking stake right down my heart and try to run Motherfucker, I'm a vampire.  And I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones. Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold? For goodness sakes, where is my self-control? Of home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all Heart has fucking lost all Heart has lost all hope (He's lost all hope) (He's lost all hope) (He's lost all hope) All hope, my heart has lost all hope
I'm calling it now but if he does another song like this. I think it will be sink or swim. Sink or swim would fit beautifully with these two reimagined songs.   My boyfriend is calling Alone as the next. I'm calling Sink or Swim
One of the greatest reimaginings of a song ever! Ronnie is always slaying! And those screams! 😍
To be honest the only thing missing here to complete the vampire theme is a Pipe Organ elements, probably on the lead adlib and some other build ups on some parts of the song probably, kinda lang like Praise be to my master and also Gothic neclord battle theme in Suikoden 2 OST as an example look it up, just an opinion and just sayin.
I feel like I would love this one more if I hadn't grown up with the original.  But it's still amazing and I'm here for his voice ❤
woah.........so many chills from this masterpiece. I'm speechless. I didn't know this classic song from youth could be turned into something so beautiful. xoxo
Wow😃there is no limit to this mans talent. This was Brilliant!
damn that was amazing.
Literally had goosebumps 💀❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Can he just redo the entire album.
this song is Revampired  !! 😁
We need a vampire movie with Ronnie as vampire king and his brother is bmth lead singer
Is that Paige from wwe 🤔🤔
What a masterpiece! I’m crying so hard!
Ronnie is a poet, Ronnie is a musician, a singer, Ronnie is a true artist... <3 What can't this man do?
Gilaaaaaa men paraaah keren 🔥🔥🔥
Imagine this song live. With a full orquestra.
Looks like a different person with no tattoos! I love this though. 😀 hard to say which one I like better!!!
'The drug in me is reimagined, 'Revamped' How many more of these puns can they make on rereleased songs?

Verry good, like a teater
This is the best movie I’ve ever seen 👏👏
I want a Ronnie musical. I would even travel to the USA for if I have to.
Absolutely love the original, this version is beautiful and this look really suits Ronnie.🥰
After I've watched it a couple times now, I just noticed that the choir guys were also the ones tying him up at the end.
HOLLY FUCK
Just Chills The Whole Song, Absolutely Love It!!
"And whiskey seems to be my holy water" oh damn <3
i didn’t know what to expect but holy shit this is fucking beautiful
I have no words for the masterpiece I just heard...simply amazing
I love how Ronnie Radke makes music that doesn’t quite tell his listeners what it is exactly about but true fans still feel the emotional connection in his music.... When will you mortals believe that I just want the world to bleed - fucking awesome
Damn, just damn... the original is pretty good to start with, but this is on a whole bother level.
damn love it
Stumbled on this guy 4 years ago by mistake  No regrets
Ronnie started with the companions and ended up becoming a vampire at Harkons castle
Paige was so beautiful. She really has changed your life, huh Ronnie?
Let's sing along   Well I'm not a vampire But I feel like one Sometimes I sleep all day Because I hate the sunlight My hands are always shaking Body's always aching And the dark is when I feed  Well I can lure any woman that I want to in my bed With me And whiskey seems to be my holy water Mothers better lock your doors And hide your daughters  I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold?

Watched this clip about 5 times in a row when it came out. Now this number went up above 100. Started listening to Falling in Reverse at the end of 2020, and they became my favorites instanly. Couldn't thank them enough for all the great times they gave me through their art. This is the band I will one day introduce my kids to. Keep up the great great work

massive Eurovision vibes from like 3:53 on just because of the dramatic wind machine
Ronnie Radke, You are a genius. So much emotion, straight musician, the transitions. So underrated and too hated. You are like no other.
Fucking love it! You guys are legend! Last 4 songs from FIR is currently my fav (i just knew about FIR since Popular Monster) This really give me goosebump and is waaaaaaaaaaaayyyy better than before. Love it! Keep it up man :D
Holy fucking shit! 👁👄👁
M par Conte Vlad!
So, in case anyone else is wondering what exactly was going on in this video, like I was, here's what I could come up with from watching it a few times and pausing every few seconds. The version of Paige in the white dress is the vampire Paige, living alone in the mansion after Ronnie's death, and she's walking through various rooms and seeing memories of her past self with Ronnie. I think it starts with her in the blue dress watching Ronnie play piano, and everything is good, but then something happens and he kills someone. Maybe the owner of the house/the person the cop later shows him a photo of.  Ronnie buries the body, and maybe Paige doesn't find out about it (since she's calmly sewing as if nothing's wrong). Then the bloodstain on the ground is either from another victim of Ronnie's, or maybe the same one that she has now found out about. She cleans up after him and helps him cover it up, but doesn't look happy about it. I think, based on how relatively calm she still is now, compared with how afraid she is later, we can assume the victim was either someone she didn't care about, or someone who deserved it, maybe. She probably still doesn't know he's a vampire, at this point; she probably just assumes he's a regular person who happens to be a murderer.  Then the police show up with those photos. I think the man in the photo is Ronnie's first victim, but it's hard to say if the woman is also a victim of his, or if Paige is the woman in the photo. The resolution makes it hard to tell, but I'm starting to think maybe it's her in the photo. If this is the case, maybe the man was an abusive husband who Ronnie killed to save her, and that's why she was willing to help him cover it up.  Ronnie denies having seen the man, but maybe Paige is starting to feel guilty for what happened, so they have an argument and she leaves. Ronnie starts drinking and spirals, during her time away, and begins luring other people to his mansion to satiate his thirst for blood. Some time passes, and Paige decides to return, but when she reaches the door, she hears the gunshot. I think the gunshot was probably fired by one of the victims, at Ronnie, in self defence, because what need does a vampire have of a gun?  Paige runs inside and finds the bodies, and Ronnie with glowing eyes and vampire teeth in a woman's neck, and they both freak out. Ronnie runs because he's terrified of her knowing the truth, and Paige is terrified because... well, he's a vampire. She knew he was a killer, but this is different. Ronnie returns to find that she has killed herself (With the knife she was using to cut the thread during the sewing scene, by the way, which is great foreshadowing), but I really can't work out why she did this. Were his latest victims people she cared about, or was she blaming herself for leaving, thinking if she hadn't left he might not have killed those people?  I don't know, but Ronnie clearly doesn't want to lose her, so he gives some of his own blood to save her, right before the mob show up to kill him. Ronnie lets them tie him up and kill him, maybe because he's realised that he's gone from hurting those who deserve it, to hurting innocents, to hurting those he loves, and he doesn't want it to go any further.  After his death, vampire Paige lives for some time, alone in the mansion (as the woman in the white dress), wandering through the rooms and remembering her life with Ronnie, but eventually decides yet again to kill herself, and that is when she walks out onto the balcony in the morning sun to let herself burn. It's unclear whether this is really a suicide, or simply a vampire deciding she's lived long enough, and finally letting herself die. It kind of depends on how much time passed between Ronnie's death and hers, but I think it's the second option. She doesn't seem that sad, more just nostalgic as she watches all the memories throughout the video. Metaphorically, I don't really know what it means, but feel free to let me know what you think. I'm keen to hear other people's interpretations of this amazing piece of art.
so beautiful. My eyes teared up
1 million views after 6 days, cool ✌️😎👍
Woah didn't know I needed this. I'm obsessed.
F-fff---- These "Re"-mastered of their songs is nothing but a goddamn gem of rollarcoasters. Can't wait for them to do "Coming Home (Revisited)" or even "Popular Monster (Repopularized)"
WTF did my eyes and EARS just witness?!  Oh Ronnie Radke made this? Now it all makes sense friggin nasty nasty remake 😱🤘😯🤘
Don't even know what to say, I feel like amazing is an understatement. This is just pure perfection. Ronnie just shows again why he is one of my favorite vocalists of all time and he also shows why he is just a pure musical genius. Ronnie deserve a Grammy, Oscar, golden globe, or any other possible award for this masterpiece.
This is badass!
2021 and it's bop
FUCKING MASTERPIECE
I'm Here Because Paige!
This is going in the classics list with evanescence, gonna be on repeat for years and years
Thank you for being such a genius!
Ok so this feels like it's follows the same stuff as Dracula untold like the eyes the ending the way he turns Paige like it's crazy how much resemblence there is
This is gay
OOO MMM GGG, what dod I just watch!!! That man can sing, and the video... Goosebumps!
That voice though 🙌🏻 just amazing 🙌🏻
Puh...i can´t find any  words... :x <3
Anyone else notice his tatts are gone? ~(ﾟoﾟ;)~
Maravilhoso!!!
Now the scene in "The Drug In Me Is Reimagined"  that sees the sharp fangs is clear
MASTERPIECE ! You are a FUCKIN GENIUS ! GOD BLESS YOU
Were there any Easter eggs in this like "The drug in me is Reimagined"?
Goosebumps!
wtf this so sick dude, very loveee this song
Next should be Tragic Magic Revamped
Paige, one of the best women's wrestler ever lived.
The more I watch this the more I realize ronnie has to be in the vampire diaries universe or somwthing man. His eyes glow red when he feeds, he abuses alcohol like its nothing lol, the way he turns paige is by feeling her his own blood.... (Big seller there) he burns in the sun anddd ofc has that lovely violent streak we all love and know. 😊 I just can't unsee this, ronnie needs an oscar or something this truly Is a masterpiece
This should be in the Morbius movie honestly I sounds like something that should be in it also this is such a masterpiece
nearly brought me to tears wtf
FUCKING MASTERPIECE <3
I'm with no words, what ha great song and video, Ronnie is a genius.
Why the end is so sad😭💔?
He created a movie, I’m liking this revamped series.
If there were more people out there that just appreciated your talent....I can’t begin to explain how amazing this was. Bravo sir 🙏 you are truly one of the very best
First INK with their song and now this. This is fantastic
Очень круто наблюдать за группой которая меняется на глазах
That's was the best movie i've ever heard!
jaja vampiro
Idk I'm still stuck on There's No Sympathy For The Dead... sorry
Oh my f***** god! So perfect
At first I was like, “Hey that’s Paige!” But then I remembered that they’re dating 😂
Ok gotta admit I thought this was gonna suck like drug in me reimagined but this wasnt that bad at all still prefer the original
🖤🖤🖤 Fucking brilliant
I didn't know I needed to see Ronnie as a victorian vampire
oh god this is perfect it was already one of the best songs ever but now its 10000000000000 times better
At this point I want this whole album redone in this melodic darker tone  but with music videos that tell one part of the story for each song. And Paige is the star bc I simp for her :)
This is legen.... wait for it.... dary... LEGENDARY!
oh god make a full album of this, tour it with a orchestra, it will be epic.
LoL, this same house is in Palaye Royale - Tonight is the night i die
WOW simply wow!!!!!!  Love both versions but this one is on another level!
YES I’VE BEEN WAITING ON THIS FOREVER
Your revisiting the past..of songs gone by. And I have to say.fukn amazing.Vocals.range iz insane.& piano.cant wait to see some more.👊🎶🔥

I just love all his song, even the drug in me is reimagined and now this revamped, so fucking Up! achievements👏👏👏
I'm back again for the 500th time in 3 days...
I love this 😤😤😤😤❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
It might be just because I've been watching Sabrina on Netflix, but when he says "So God bless all of you now" it almost feels like a curse because vampires are kind of pseudo-demons and hell bound. I took it as kind of a "fuck you, I'm out".
This shittt is so amazing🔥🔥🔥 I've never heard Ronnie like this before like omg I'm in lovvveeee🥰🥵
Nope still can’t get over it 🥰
This is a fucking masterpiece.
such some Opera vibez. i feel like I'm in an underworld of Gothic and Phantom of the Opera mixed with Vampire 🖤
What a MASTERPIECE ._. i was there with it, with my whole Heart 🖤🤘🏻 daamn Ronnie i love seeing u incredibly getting stronger. Keep On i hope one Day i can see u in Switzerland  😫
WOW
Well, I'm not a vampire, but I feel like one Sometimes I sleep all day 'cause I hate the sunlight My hands are always shaking Body's always aching, and the dark is when I feed Well, I can lure any woman that I want to in my bed with me  And whiskey seems to be my holy water And mothers, better lock your doors and hide your daughters  'Cause I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold? For goodness sakes, where is my self-control? If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all hope  Well, I'm not a zombie, but I feel like one today Self-induced comatose, chemical daze My head is always spinning from this dizzy blurry vision and my stomach has had enough I feel like a lady that is pregnant with a baby 'cause I'm always throwing up  And hi, my name is Ronnie, I'm an addict And daddy should've never raised me on Black Sabbath  I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold? For goodness sakes, where is my self-control? If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all hope  When will you mortals believe? (He's not a vampire) I just want the world to bleed (He's not a vampire) Lust at the sight of your blood (He's not a vampire) I swear to God, I am not a— (He is not a—) (He is not a—)  So God bless all of you now 'Cause I'm going straight to Hell (Straight to Hell) And I'm taking you down with me Because you know damn well  So I sharpen my teeth 'cause I love the way it feels When I sink into your skin and draw the only thing that's real You don't believe me, should I write it in blood?

If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all Heart has fucking lost all Heart has lost all hope (He's lost all hope) (He's lost all hope) (He's lost all hope) All hope, my heart has lost all hope
I´m not a corpse but I feel like one, my soul just vanished while I was listening, such talent!
I like this. But I'm at a party right now. I cant dance to this.
I thought I was watching a movie- This is purely art, I must say- Ronnie did an amazing job here!
Can i stop watching this beautiful masterpiece? No? Okay •watches it 300 more times• 😭 no in all seriousness though Ronnie dude and the band and the production and everyone else who made this beauty of a video and song kuddos to you this was just AMAZING. Ive never watched a song more than ive watched this.
HOLY SHIT!!! That was so good 😁
Is that Rebecca Black...?
the vocal of ronnie is insane
Glad i accidentally stumbled across this gem
Beautiful story
Glad I got to see them at the last vans warped tour
I listened to the original just so I could hear this
I love this version
😱 Ronnie I got say this video is amazing  and I love theme with the vampire  of you in this video wow I'm so amazed  by this video. GREAT WORK
I am obsessed with this song. I don’t know why Ronnie hasn’t started acting yet. He’d be amazing.
I'm not dying until I hear this version live!
Honestly I love his music n I loved the drug in me is you remastered but not entirely feeling this one watching the video makes it better but not one of his best songs but good to others
Man, Ronnie Radke musical talent is so versatile. I can't think of anyone else could pulled of something like he have done and still succeed
Is that Paige? She looks beautiful!!
Omg my heart. This is a awesome song and beautiful video. Love it 🤘🏼🥰💜🖤
Opera in reverse😇👿
YOU'RE BIG RONEY!!!!
Okay, so when are we getting a full musical?? My money..? Take it! All of it!! pLeAaSsee!
On a real note though, when is Ronnie gonna make a movie? Or a musical? A lot of these videos (not just from Falling in Reverse) are better stories than the shit we have to deal with from Disney, Warner Bros, etc
Dracula Musical!!!!!!
The very begining gave me Mr. Crowly vibes
This is AMAZING!! love hearing this voice range from him omg
Ronnie, bro, i've only one question. why are you soooo good?? how you fckn doing that all the time!?!? i'm just LOSING MY MIND, when listening your songs. i think, no no no, i'm sure that only one thing which you can't do, it's just do nothing.
MORE VAMPIRE THEME ♡♡♡♡
I almost became a Vampire after smoking a Bowl 1 night.....
Can we take a minute to appreciate how amazing Paige looks!

Fucking Epic...completely blown away!!
The most awesome music video that i've seem in the last 5 years
The vampire look fit Ronnie so well
Which Underworld was this??
OMG AAAAAAA!!!
I love this!  Reminiscent of Avenged Sevenfold’s Nightmare album
Absolutely Beautiful!

So are we gonna get an album of revamped songs?
ronnie = lestat
Ronnie just keeps getting better....
Well this was bad..
Every song is actually is a movie . Right ? 🔥
love you but this one is a big L ;(
First off Ronnie I'm so sorry for your loss of Derek. I hope this finds you well if you read this. I also have to say this song is an absolute masterpiece, but you know that. You should definitely make an album of remastered styled older songs. I'd buy it. The piano though and the acting! You need to make a movie bro! A+++++
It's not my pain but I sure as hell feel it.
If Any Notice If Your Wrestling Fan But The Girl You Seeing Is Paige
The energy behind the last few lyrics with him at his peak just blows me away right as he’s about to burn 🔥
This is so good and Ronnie looks so amazing 😻  I need a full album ASAP
I like the video. Not too sure about the song style. I think I'm gonna have to listen to it a couple of times but I like the original a tad more.
wow!wow!wow! So much chills down my spine! This version is AMAZING!
9/10 , I was Team Vampire so I didn’t appreciate the ending , but it was a nice movie
Omg, Ronnie it´s so cute as a vampire.
Masterpiece.

Honestly, I came to see Paige 😍😍😍but ayye this video was amazingly put together

Wonder how many artist will follow  and remake their own stuff now cause this was absolutely fucking brilliant.
Nothing short of incredible
Im over these slow remakes but it is still good✌🏻
This needs to be a 2 hour movie
I think RAISED BY WOLVES needs to be done next. Omfg…
poggers
If Ronnie isn't cast as the next Dracula I don't want it LOL I already have expectations now.
emo childhood memories are quaking
Is it just me or does the clouds form some japenese characters in the the sky ? 🤔 (sorry for my bad English, it isn't my mother tongue)
omg this is so good
I was a teen jumping to it, now I'm 20 and I feel like their music matures with me... started aggresivly pop punk emo, now it's a ballad Type O Negative's cousin
I listen to it every day. I love it♡
...Move over Meatloaf...

Why do these keep getting better and better? ❤️
🖤
So when is this season coming to Netflix?? ❤️😍
If we counted all the reactions views, this would be at about 2 million by now
Ronnie and Remington are the only vampires who's allowed to bite me
Até curtiria, mas lembrei que você tratou mal os brasileiros na sua live
The cliff scene reminds me of Dark Shadows
Paige is so beautiful when she doesn’t overdo the makeup
foda  cadê os BR?
Everything i's fucking good in this song... God damn l cried to much at the  end for no reason... But that's soooooo goood
Ronnie, your vocal range is outstanding.
I can’t express how fucking happy this makes me. Falling in reverse + Anne Rice. Good Job Ronnie!!!!
Yo, this song is gruesomely hard in a  completely different way. Like an opera death scene.
This song is a masterpiece! I get goosebumps all over my body from start to finish! The clip was shot professionally and very beautifully, like a movie! God, what a perfect acting performance Ronnie has 👏 His voice is beautiful, at the moment when he burns from the Sun and the choir sings in the background.. I'm starting to cry. It's perfect! Listening to this song and watching this video, it seems as if I went to the theater for a professional performance 👏👏👏👍
1.4k who dislike was just so amazed by Ronnie voice that they misclicked it
I can only imagine how hard this must've been on the band without Derek Jones but it was great to see this, gave me shivers up my spine. Still such a talented group of musicians. Keep up the amazing work guys. ^_^ This is art in the musical form.
Absolutely amazing, love everything Ronnie does
Ronnie's musical genius is so underrated. Not just vocally or lyrically but you know he composed the whole arrangement. He's a phenomenal artist
I have a gothic feeling. I love it! :)  this video was like a whole MOVIE!!!!
Je n'ai même pas de mots... je suis choquée ! C'est MAGNIFIQUE !! ❤
😍😍😍👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
totally awesome <3
Damn man really had me believin he wasn’t a vampire till he dropped this one
This is beautiful
Paige is looking good these days
Has an avenged sevenfold feeling to it
pregant wuth a bebe :D
THIS IS AMAZING!!!!
When music gives you chils ❤️❤️❤️
🖤
LYRICS: [Verse 1] Well, I'm not a vampire, but I feel like one Sometimes I sleep all day 'cause I hate the sunlight My hands are always shaking Body's always aching, and the dark is when I feed Well, I can lure any woman that I want to in my bed with me   And whiskey seems to be my holy water And mothers, better lock your doors and hide your daughters   'Cause I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold? For goodness sakes, where is my self-control? If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all hope   Well, I'm not a zombie, but I feel like one today Self-induced comatose, chemical daze My head is always spinning from this dizzy blurry vision and my stomach has had enough I feel like a lady that is pregnant with a baby 'cause I'm always throwing up   And hi, my name is Ronnie, I'm an addict And daddy should've never raised me on Black Sabbath   I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold? For goodness sakes, where is my self-control? If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all hope   When will you mortals believe? (He's not a vampire) I just want the world to bleed (He's not a vampire) Lust at the sight of your blood (He's not a vampire) I swear to God, I am not a— (He is not a—) (He is not a—)   So God bless all of you now 'Cause I'm going straight to Hell (Straight to Hell) And I'm taking you down with me Because you know damn well   So I sharpen my teeth 'cause I love the way it feels When I sink into your skin and draw the only thing that's real You don't believe me, should I write it in blood? You better drive that fucking stake right down my heart and try to run Motherfucker, I'm a vampire   And I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold? For goodness sakes, where is my self-control? If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all Heart has fucking lost all Heart has lost all hope (He's lost all hope) (He's lost all hope) (He's lost all hope) All hope, my heart has lost all hope
Imagine a 2 hour musical like this
Paige WWE...
Can't get enough of this
Paige playing as Ronnie's lover makes sense. they should date in real life!!!
The most fking epic song ever
Nicolas Cage energy
Goddammit Ronnie did it again . I'M SOBBING 😭💙👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
No tat Ronnie?! Shivers down my spine
on repeat
Paige looks amazing in here.
The music they do give me a strange feeling inside,like the music and the lyrics touch the core of my being. Most of the people I know judge this kind if music ,and can't understand why I  listen to it. I can only say I feel it , the emotion behind the words, the music is pure enjoyment to my ears. Don't ever stop making music, we need more music like this .
Ребят. Подскажите, пожалуйста, что это за жанр? Вроде бы классика, мюзикл, но поискал что-то в этих жанрах - скукота какая-то. Или посоветуйте исполнителей, поющих в данном стиле. Просто очень песня понравилась, хотелось бы расширить свой музыкальный плейлист схожими песнями.
I'm noticing a pattern. Recently, every video hints to the next video/song  Popular Monster had the court room from The Drug in me is You.....then TDIMIY Reimagined came out  in TDIMIY Reimagined, twords the end of the music video, he has sharp teeth indicating either he is a vampire or is still the monster from Popular Monster. Obviously he was hinting he was a vampire......then this song came out  I'm trying to figure out what hints I can find in this music video
please tell me there is a CD with all these revamped and reimagined songs coming out. TAKE MY MONEY!
Ich wußte,das Du noch von Dir hören läßt.
Super Video and Song.
My childer evolved to eat sunlight and create automatical healing where ever i go. Vampires that convert in AZ the only place on earth with the most sunlight where bella was from....in twlight...inverts the parasite in goloncondra which is vampire redemption
Situations remastered. Hey Ronnie! 👍
I want FiR to do a feat with Jinger please
I highkey expected "hello my name is Ronald the third" in that line.... idk whyyyyy
🔥
Who's here after knowing WWE diva paige is starring here😁?
Music video of the year
He started yelling and the choir came in and I was like “😳” - honestly I really like this ❤️
Damn that was good
just wow
[Verse 1] Well, I'm not a vampire, but I feel like one Sometimes I sleep all day 'cause I hate the sunlight My hands are always shaking Body's always aching, and the dark is when I feed Well, I can lure any woman that I want to in my bed with me  [Pre-Chorus 1] And whiskey seems to be my holy water And mothers, better lock your doors and hide your daughters  [Chorus] 'Cause I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold?

How am I meant to listen to anything else after that...
Ronnie you have ur way with music, whatever song you do its either amazing or just beautiful! I have listened to every song of yours. I love u and Ur band!
Honestly every time this guy does anything he gives 120%
I think this just shows how much depth he has to his creativity. Ronnie your an amazing and talented artist
love Paige and Ronnie ❤️
Dammit man.  I see the very strong "interview with a vampire" asthetic going on there. It really makes Ronnie almost look like a woman in some of them shots.
where your tattoos roonie?🙁
Falling in reverse is by far my favorite group I play it all day on Spotify at work 8 hours of me trying too sing #ICANTSING #ITRYTHO all music from FALLING IN REVERSE 💯🔥
This shit is fucking powerful! Yep, I tear up everytime!
Falling in reverse is going better and better
I LOVE THIS VERSION AND VIDEO
So we’re gonna ignore the fact that there’s a 2 time wwe champion in the video my favorite female wrestler😍
Metal. Rap. Now Operatic. Dude is the dictionary definition of talented.
It is really great but i'm sorry i get the dislikes. On 5:00 til the sun comes up it's just too heavy screaming. Kinda lost me there man. Up to that point i'll admit its great.  Now let's see who can't take a different opinion...
This song is absolutely chilling! also great work on this video, you pull off being a vampire so well Ronnie! I almost thought you were going to bite me!
great video, awful song.
[Verse 1] Well, I'm not a vampire, but I feel like one Sometimes I sleep all day 'cause I hate the sunlight My hands are always shaking Body's always aching, and the dark is when I feed Well, I can lure any woman that I want to in my bed with me  [Pre-Chorus 1] And whiskey seems to be my holy water And mothers, better lock your doors and hide your daughters  [Chorus] 'Cause I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold?

😲😲😲😲💗💗💗💗
как же о%уенно, который день на репите
I’m in love
Like a little piece of heaven avenged sevenfold, but dark version.
Is anyone else here because they know Paige was in this ?
Amazing work!! Couldnt be better.
I don't know the original at all, but damn this blew my mind.
Awesome Forever Fan of Ronnie
masterpiece
Great version  Ronnie “The Vamp “ 🧛🏻‍♂️🧛🏻‍♂️🧛🏻‍♂️
For a second I thought it was Adam driver but I saw the face it’s Ronnie 😨 I’m used to seeing him in short hair this is a great music video!  To bad this didn’t come out on Valentine’s Day
We need a new "Situations".
pagie is in this video
He remind me so much of takumi from nana
checkout my reaction to this if you want
Ronnie is just like Skyrim. It just keeps getting better with some mod(s)ifications whilst keeping true to the original release.
3:50 ....... jesus christ the beauty of this part
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️Love it
why isnt this song and music video trending?
Raised by the wolves next plz
Give us a whole album of this please!
I'm just happy that they didn't remove the "Hi my name is Ronnie, I'm an addict!" part 😚
This needs a movie adaptation, like really
4;36-4;53 who else thought of the vampire diaries
A WHOLE HEARTED MASTERPIECE
THIS. IS. MASTERPIECE!
This you can tell was just so personal and emotional for him  and it's just a complete master piece it brought me to tears.. literally I love it just as much if not more then I did the original his voice, the production just everything so lovely and we'll did 💯❤️ I can't imagine the blood sweat and tears put into this
It's a masterpiece Ronnie is a genius man, everytime he did anything in a special way, Ronnie's way.
this is the same as "the drug in me is you" scenario, rock to piano
This is f*ckin epic 🖤
Whoever put dislike smells like sweaty balls 😂
Hi, my name is Hayley and I'm addicted to this version and the video. Watched it at least five times today, lol!
Epic.
he really say he can lure women in bed with his wife walking away smh
Love Ronnie... Paige is okay 🤷‍♀️.
.....Well THANKS FOR RUINING INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE forever! >8| _Lestat_ an otherworldly beauty? Honey, I've seen vampire Ronnie Radke - come off it.  On a more serious note, this was beautiful. Both cinematically and musically. Loved the lyrics changing at the end. May have cried. The goth in me has been fed for a _week_   (... and no wonder you wouldn't shave your head for Twitch subs. 9v9 xD)
Yet another masterpiece.
His voice at the end gives a vibe of Messiah Marcolin from candlemass, I love the video and I love this version too.without a doubt Ronnie is a genius as he has managed to reinvent himself over the years and continue to surprise us, it is incredible. l would like a version like this of my apocalypse is one of my favorite songs from when he was in escape the fate .
I hate to be this guy, but the original is still better... i love the video and the take you went with it, but the lyrics themselves belong to a rock/pop instrumental like in the original. Will always love your work nonetheless!! ❤❤❤
So grateful for this 🖤
I thought this guy was fucking cool before I never thought he would be more fucking cool I guess I was wrong
Lo amo lml
This is amazing
Whew Paige looks good lol
This was my favorite song back in middle/high school.  This version is so beautifully done and I love it just as much if not more. Whoever your make up artist and Hairdresser was deserve a raise. The visuals chilled me to the absolute bone.  Ronnie looks so perfect during the whole song. Chillingly beautiful and the actress that plays alongside him is an absolute vision. This is both a treat for my eyes and ears. Excuse me while I go back to laying on the floor and basking in the euphoria this has given me. Thank you Ronnie. You are a genius. @epitaphrecords
Just give ronnie the Grammy already
Running though the woods...... That's all I could hear when the choir appeared 😅  Might be a stretch, would love to hear a re-imagined 'Not Good Enough....'
I noticed that ronnie is a vampire in the other reimagined song as well. Is this song a continuation of that video? If he makes more reimagined versions of his songs, I wonder if they will also be vampire related.
Well, it looks like 2021 is gonna be fucking epic.
So... Didn't think I'd be crying at the end of this. I've always loved your music, Ronnie, from ETF to FIR, but these reimaginings of your songs have really shown your range, both emotional and vocal. Incredible job well done, loved every second of it, both musically and visually, can't wait for more.
Lookin like 2003 Davey Havok from AFI in some of these scenes.
Saraya did absolutely amazing ❤️
Music of the year 2021!!!
I really think if Ronnie did a ballad of God If Your Above would be perfect in this style
Ronnie could legit redo the whole first album like this and I would throw so much money at him to have it. I want MORE of this!!
How can y'all even put a thumbs down on this for real?
Holy fuck.    🤤 🖤
Well, he out did himself this time
Soooo amazing and just so beautiful
I can’t wait for “The Drug In Me Was You” and “I Wasn’t A Vampire”
😍😍😍
"Slaps roof of YouTube" This bad boy can hold so many revamped puns.
Paige has an Date with the Special Ronnie Vampire😎👍
NEEDS to hit  1m views
In the "The drug in me is reimagined" video Ronnie has fangs. Which leads me to think that he was hinting at "I'm not a vampire" revamp.  Has anyone spotted any clues in this video on what the next song could be?
I listened to this a couple days ago and was like no, checked it out again in a different mood and holy shit it's pretty badass
thank you so much ronnie, youre music is helping me in a very dark time of my life at this moment, ive listened you and your band super late but i truly love you guys and thank you so so so so much. youre helping me heal, and i really want to appreciate this . you're amazing and i have so much respect for you. if you read this , thank you brother.
Damn Ronnie, you're amazing!
I can't wait for FIR to have concerts again cuz if they perform these revamped versions mixed with the original versions of some songs, it'll be an experience unlike any other. They should tour with Motionless in White and do a whole revamped concert <3
What the heck that was so nice
i haven't even watched it yet and I already know im gunna cry
That's exactly what a vampire would say
I see references from “Interview with a Vampire” and “Dark Shadows.” I love it!!!!
Okay but like he really doesnt age so uhm is he really a vampire😱  Loving this revamp!!
Dude this shit is fucking bananas
I HAD GOOSEBUMPS WHILE LISTENING TO THIS SONG!!
wow
nobody is doing it like he is
Unbelievably Gorgeous! This artist’s art is above any singer in talent and music I’ve ever seen or listened to! Blown away
Bro the ending got me crying rip Derek 😫💔💔
Eehhh. I like it and i don't. I think the screams honestly were misplaced, they didn't need to be in this one. I like The Drug in Me is Reimagined, but this one doesn't quite fit as well with a revamp.
cannot. stop. listening. absolute legend.
Falling In Reverse is just making a whole cinematic sound track and I'm here for it
how many people are here to see paige
1.25 speed
Literally, brought me to tears
Please keep do more :0
We need more remastered versions of older songs like this plz
Que joya
Two words: Holy. Fuck.
Do this style song  with my apocalypse!!!!
Make a movie 🤔
Okay I’m commenting a second time but idc. This video dude. Holy...I don’t even know what to say, how to respond. I’ve watching it for the hundredth time now and am just getting paiges POV and wow. Just wow 🤩
Rest In Peace Derek!
Anyone else get vibes of Meatloafs “it’s all coming back to me now” video?!
Personally, I liked the video a lot more than I did the reiteration of the song. Just my opinion though.
I love this sound. Very good job!
OMG este video fue grabado en la misma casa que el video de "tonight is the night i die" de palaye royale♥♥♥
OMG i love the fact that this video was filmed atthe same plae that the music video of "tonight is the night i die" by palaye royale♥♥♥
I was here when I was younger and now I'm here as an adult...  I have refallen in love with my fav song♡  Thank you.
I’m in love with it 🥺the elegance in his voice to be this has more of a powerful meaning the second time around like 🥺Lordy  Ronnie is pure fucking gold I tell you 💕💕
WOW speechless
God.Damn.
Loved Alone when I heard it years ago. This band is in my heart for centuries to come!!!
Shit brings tears to the eye first half then just slaps you with that hard core shit at the end I FUCKING LOVE! Beautiful work ronnie and my condolences much love
REVAMPED YEAH YE GOT ME
aquí Antes del millón
Why dis doesnt have the mil yet ! This is lit! str8  🔥🔥🔥
I am in love with his reimagingings and revamped songs. Well all two of them so far. Im so proud of how far he has come and loving the music born from that.
had a little bit of a la dispute vibe towards the end
One of my all time favorite songs with Ronnie was Cellar door. I always imagined it would make for a badass remake in this form.
The only issue I take with this is non face/neck tatted. I don’t like it 😂
“I feel like a lady that is pregnant with a baby cuz I’m always throwing up...”  🤨🤢🤮=me trying to rationalize Ronnie putting these lyrics in a song...
Un putain de chef-d'œuvre...
OMG Paige played the part wonderful
this a fucken masterpiece - happy day of the bleeding hearts </3
I'm drinking this sh!+ up!
This one is better then the original, like how pagie is in it she's perfect for this role You kickass on that piano I got lost in the Melody. You ever think of having a cello or a violin play side by side piano?
Oh... my... God!
That was beautiful 🖤🖤🖤🖤
Wait is that Paige?
i wasn't ready....  i wasn't fucking ready...  this was...  just ..wow
This is stunning ❤️
Queen of the Damned sequel would be nice
AMAZING BUT WHY IS NOBODY TALKING ABOUT HOW GORGEOUS PAIGE IS!! 😍😩
Oh my gosh. I can't. Even. Function after that.
At first I was like why isn't this called "Reimagined" like The Drug In Me. Then I got it.
Don’t mind me just admiring this masterpiece
Oh hell yeah! Cool AF video, cool AF song. Ronnie is back! Excited to see what comes next! 🙌
honestly i think they should have left this song alone the original is perfect there music lately is been really bad
just... amazing..!!!!
All the donations from his streams went into this. Very proud
THIS IS AWESOME
As person that was born with vampire teeth my gf calls them that so this song makes it ironic
Ronnie out here lookin like tommy wiseau.
magique, magnifique, puissant ... un chef d'œuvre visuel et musical 🖤🖤🖤
Absolutely nobody is better than ronni
these mortals are not ready for this level of quality.
Three Observations: 1: The Artwork for the two reimagined singles, enough said 2: Some of Ronnies best vocals ever are right here 3:I want to see Falling in Reverse and Palaye Royale do something together.
Bro- FIREEEE🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🚒 I love both versions
Interesting...
AMAZING!
The shit I just took while watching this sounded better. Fuck off, Epitaph.
Ronnie can sing my bed time stories for me. I will jam out then pass out.
So when's the movie coming out? Nice trailer🤘👌.
pretty good but i like the original more.  Now that might just be bias since thats what I listened to in my angsty years :P
I clicked like before listening, because Spotify.  Edit: Holy sheet. This video is amazing.
There really is no one quite like FIR!! this is on another level!! I'm in love!!!
this starts off sooo good but just goes down hill from 2:26 onwards...
This is beyond remarkable and I usually hate this cringy vampire stuff.
Okay I can't believe I'm saying this, it's meant as a massive compliment to this version, knowing the original. But I get the bohemian rhapsody vibe from this. Hats off truely
what-
That's heavy...Love the It's all coming back to me now" vibes tho!! 😂 Gotta love his fucking insanely genius..artistic mind!
WOW!! ❤️
when Ronnie can tell a better vampire story in 6 min than twilight can in 5 movies
does anyone else think this should be a movie/show?      like if u agree and then maybe he'll see it and make a movie/show lol let's make it happen :)
Nooo amoooo💕
Is it just me or does Ronnie look like long haired Davey Havok from AFI?
fcking goosebumps everytime this is on repeat in my mind, its giving me inspiration for a story (I'm a student film maker and writer) this song hits you right in the heart
amazing.
Well I'm not a vampire But I feel like one Sometimes I sleep all day Because I hate the sunlight My hands are always shaking Body's always aching And the dark is when I feed Well I can lure any woman that I want to in my bed With me And whiskey seems to be my holy water Mothers better lock your doors And hide your daughters I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness sake Where is my self control? If home is where my heart is Then my heart has lost all hope Well I'm not a zombie But I feel like one today Self induced comatose, chemical daze My head is always spinning From this dizzy, blurry vision And my stomach has had enough I feel like a lady That is pregnant with a baby 'Cause I'm always throwing up Hi, My name is Ronnie I'm an addict (Hi, Ronnie!) Daddy should've never raised me on Black Sabbath! I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness sake Where is my self control? If home is where my heart is Then my heart has lost all hope God bless all of you now 'Cause I'm going straight to Hell And I'm taking you down with me 'Cause you know damn well I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness sake Where is my self control? If home is where my heart is Then my heart has lost all hope All hope All hope
This just hits on a whole other level.
THAT perfection, that longing❤️❤️
Got a good voice but not something you would put on in the car to just listen to. Sounds like I’m at a play. And sucks to be the other members in the band who have to take a back seat and just watch him perform
5:09 Chester Bennington listening from heaven with a smile on his face
When he hits that screaming high note of his heart has lost all hope? You realize this guy has as much vision as Meatloaf, artistically.
I love this. But it's so dramatic lmao
I like it but it isn't the original sorry
This is too amazing, this is what an opera should be
Nosferonnie. 👍
Paige!
Oh my fucking god that's what I love this band 😭😍😍😍
He has such talent
still a better love story than twighlight
¡¡¡Paige!!!
This guys been watching forgetting Sarah marshal too much
You look so beautiful 🖤
Wowwwwww ❤️
I just also wanna mention we love how healthy Ronnie looks these days omg.
I just can't get over how amazing this is.
that's alison from teen wolf! i see u ronnie
Holy fuck
I was on the verge of tears for most of the video but once I saw, "In loving memory of Derek Jones" I just lost it. I'm glad I've been here since Escape The Fate. I feel like I've been watching Ronnie on his crazy journey. It's amazing seeing where he has been and how far he has come. I'm excited to see where he goes from here. Also, Paige is amazing.
Rest easy Derek 💔
Not me replaying 05:38 - 05:53 for 2 hours straight.
I'm not overwhelmed like I was when Drug in me was reimagined but omg,that voice. Amazing
Instant goosebumps 💖
Disgusting
This gave me so many goosebumps that I could feel it in my soul
This ain't bad or anything but am I the only one wanting like actual new rock music from them?
It`s very very ахуенно :D
another masterpiece
This just saved me
I did not expect that
I really don’t like this one. No offense it just isn’t my thing
its like a movie
i like this version more
Ronnie is the man always always able to blow me away.....give him a Grammy already
Amazing! Ronnie is a genius
the visuals make this song decent
Freaking yes.
just amazing, such a genius
Ronnie Radke... I'm speechless... You are bloody genius!!!! This whole thing is EPIC ❤ thank you!!!
I'm in love with your voice. Amazing voice, but more amazing how  you put your heart,soul and emotions,  all of them in one piece.  Once again. I'm in love with your voice.
Saraya <3
Loki can play the piano
I have lost count how many times I have watched this masterpiece. This deserves so many more views than it has. Ronnie and everyone involved in this deserves an award, hands down.
Was this really necessary tho lol
holy shieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet
Примечательно то, что песня работает на все 1000% с видеорядом.
Wow
The line "hi my names ronnie I'm an addict" the amount of emotion behind his voice actually got me to shed a tear because I've been there and damn you can tell hes still raw on the inside
Why does Ronnie look like Loki?
🖤🖤🖤🖤
Whoa... just so amazing, wonderful and powerful! The rythm, the tone, the piano, the voice, the chorus, the video... everything's just atonishing me ! The first version was good, but here and now you've broken down into another dimension, really 🖤🖤🖤
Imagine a heavy version of this song featuring Spencer from Ice Nine Kills <3
Interestingggggg........
Hopefully we get a whole drug in me is you album like this🔥🔥🔥
this is just amazing omfg
holy crap this was amazing
Ronnie NEEDS to direct a movie kinda like how Metallica made"Into the Never". He would do an AMAZING job
Foda demais!!!
Ronnie, you fucking masterful powerhouse of a human being, you've done it again. That gave me chills.
The intro is an EXACT copy of “Chertograd” by Deathstars. That was a total rip, note for note. (I’m not wrong, look it up.) But otherwise not a bad remake at all.
I swear Ronnie doesn't age!!!
Dude what an amazin job dude  So fucking proud
Bruh...I’m at a loss for words..
Is that Paige?
Just what the world needs, more emo crap where the singer tries too hard. Hard pass
Ronnie is way too good for this world. He is far ahead of all other artists. He deserves more recognition for his art.
Nice video 👍👍, telemarketing must be sucks.
Can we please talk about how well Ronnie pulls off the  classic "vampire" look
Jesus, this culture and that kind of music should be "revemped" rn. It's amazing
this comment will get mixed reviews, I'm into the syle but the remastered versions need to end. something new would be better
That was the whitest white girl fall I've ever seen lmao still a good song though but ronnie comee on bro really the white girl fall 🤣
I love how last year they posted "The Drug in me is You - Reimagined" on the day after my birthday and this time posted this the day before my birthday. Best birthday gift, both times!!
Im a huge falling in reverse fan! Ive loved everything he has done but this is aweful! Ronnie you disappoint :'(
HOLY CRAP HIS VOCALS ARE JUST GOLD HOLY CRAP I HAVE THIS ON REPEAT RONNIE NEEDS A GRAMMY HE DESERVES SOMETHING FOR THESE VOCALS AND THE PERFORMANCE HE PUT ON IN THIS MUSIC VIDEO HES A GENIUS AT EVERYTHING HE DOES AND CAN NEVER MAKE A BAD SONG WOW IM BLOWN AWAY
Wow that gave me shivers
NEW Piano Cover of I'M NOT A VAMPIRE (REVAMPED) on my channel. Check it out! :-) I'd really appreciate that!
Saraya Knight, aka Paige, is in it too! 😀
Fantastic Performance. Enough Said.
My husband went to school with Ronnie and knew him wonder if he’d remember him 🤨
Ronnie been quiet for a minute, I knew he was working on 🔥
This is just so amazing. I love the evolution from your older music to your newer songs. The thought put into each video, the thought put into the composition. Falling in Reverse is just amazing. Thank you.
Wtf 😍
RONNIE RADKE IS A FUCKING COMPOSER. Bravo Falling in Reverse. This is why I've been a fan for 10+years. Incredible. Absolutely incredible.
This should be trending
Ronnie = Mad Genius 🖤
People wanna call him the king of the music scene. He's got news for you, he's the God of it.
We want the behind the scene videos of this .  A true master class music Video
Ronnie is SO BEAUTIFUL 😍
Re "Vamped". Love it.
Prefer this version vs the original... you really get to hear his vocal range. Amazing!
goosebumps 😱😱😱
Is that paige ??
Loved it! His vocals are incredible here! The MV has a good story too, I just don’t understand why he saved her just for her burn to death seconds later hahaha  Also, seeing him without the tattoos was so weird!
Someone : you can't be better than you are in "the drug in me is reimagined" Ronnie : Hold my beer
Wow. That's is all
these lyrics are cringe
WAY TO GO PAIGE YOU ROCK KEEEP EM COMMING YOR BOYFRIEND SHOULD BE PROUD IF HES NOT THEN HE SUCKS
damn
There's nothing Ronnie can't do musically. I mean he can sing anything with any range, he can rap, play the piano so beautifully it brings tears to my eyes, he can scream effortlessly and make it sound almost elegant, and he makes all of us lady's fall in love with him in a heartbeat. He is so AMAZINGLY TALENTED, and he's so much more, I wish I had the words to do him justice. His music has changed my life forever and gives me strength to get through some really tough days, he is simply put one badass dude......
FINALLY!!! This is so freaking amazing!!
It's so good you should do a metal cover.
Epithath have gone from my top label to something i wont waste time on... fuck this shit/
Oh my god I just realized his tattoos were covered...
The beginning story of lady dimitrescu on resident evil!
Paige? Is that you?
This was pretty, and I’m diggin Ronnie as a vampire, but some of the lyrics didn’t match the mood. Like the pregnant with a baby line. In my opinion at least
This song hits so freaking hard in these times. Every time I hear it, it makes the world a little better. Jesus, this is SO good!!
YES YES YES YES
I think I should stopped at 6:11 and repeat again
This is fucking amazing
Man Ronnie is pumping the movie trailers out but why won’t he say the release date
Beautiful
What a masterpiece... Keep this amazing work <3
This is exquisite and is a musical, including visual masterpiece. The storytelling and passion delivered with such dedication, you can feel this came from the heart. I really love this symphony metal combination. I don't see how this can be topped. This will be a timeless piece. Bravo to everyone involved. The choir is stunning.
Está canción no la canto hace 9 años 0:?
Sacará Un álbum de covers de sus canciones?
Love the revamp... love his gf us in it..love it was left in memory or derek
I'm speechless..this is such a beautiful and divine art🖤🖤🖤🖤
The lol part is Ronnie revived the woman and get caught with the villagers.. tied up until the sunrise burned him and the woman also got burned by the sun🤣
Ok Ronnie, just make a god damn Falling In Reverse musical already!
Omg Paige. I love her😍😍😍😍
whoa fucking well done
this was amazing ♥ ️

аж до мурашек
Paige Looks so beautiful 🤗❤️
OMG his hair ! And Paige is so beautiful 💜
<3
here because of paige is in this music video😂
Not a big fan of this group. I only heard a few bars from the OG one and thought what a joke. Dude has an amazing big voice why would he nit let it unleash? Then I see this version! This is fucking epic!!!!! This song deserves every ounce of emotion he puts in to it with that kick ass big powerful voice!!!
The Most Beautiful Former Divas & NXT Women's Champion in WWE History PAIGE 💜🖤💜🖤💜🖤💜🖤
Mood
MASTERPIECE
Well damn, this is amazing
this got me emotional.
This is beautiful I love it amazing job ronnie
OMGGGGG IM SO HAPPY . the remake i needed .
If Ronnie is dropping a song/video guaranteed Im listening and then going to listen again.  If people dont know that he's not one of the three best musical talents alive right now then people don't know shit
All 3 of your newest music has kept me going through loss after loss during this time, and do I smell a hint of interview with a vampire here?
WOW ! I have no words to express how much I love it !
I want the first album to be re-imagined oh please!!!!
where's the tattoo on your fave ronnie??? thats so cool
With how amazing the "The Drug In Me Reimagined" turned out and how amazing this turned out please tell me "Raised By Wolves" is next
Paige is so beautiful in this video
OMG ❤️
5:19 Who also thought that Ronnie was going to kill everyone in the room like what he did in popular monster when he stand still like that again lol
AMAZING!!!
First seconds: Metin 2, the beginning
Wow
I absolutely love these remakes/new versions of their older songs. These truly show Ronnie is the king of the music scene 💃
I can't wait for 2023 Alone remake omg
WHAT KIND OF 🖤  *M A S T E R P I E C E* 🖤 IS THAT???!?!???!?!???!??? 🙌 may lord show mercy on my soul.
MAAAAAAAN SO FCKING PERFEEEEEEEECT!!!!!!!!!! IM SO HAPPY AAAAAAAAAAAAA the end destroy me but i Love the vídeo THE EMOCIONS THE DRAMA AAAAA BOY 😭😭😭😭😝😝😝😝 THIS IS THE WHY I LOVE FALLING IN REVERSE!!!!!!!!good joob man you shine🖤🤍🖤🤍🖤🤍🖤🤍🖤🤍 rip Derek...we Love him!!!
Wtf? I prefere the original version
Resident Evil Village Be Like
Absolutely phenomenal. Ronnie is one of the very few people that can't disappoint me.
is that rory culkin playing the mc ?
And Paige from WWE in the video 👌🔥
I felt like a fangirl at a bts concert
Well he did say in one of his live streams or YT vods, he said he wanted a chorus for “Drug in me Reimagined” so I guess he put it in this one! 😂
mad lad did it again
The original  was amazing  as is but this omg ... this is art iam in love with the "revamp " of older  music   normally  I don't  like when artists  do that but man ,this gives  you chills ,he  is showing  how life  & time has  Matured and change him & I think his original  fans are on the same path .
Словил слуховой оргазм )
10 из 10 ! Инструментал, вокал, передача эмоций, актерочка - высшей класс !
Some say it's a better love story than  twilight. All I know is its a awesome Revamp of the old tune I always listen too. X
I can't put into words what this song does to me.  It hits me at the very depths of my soul.  It gives me chills. It resonates so deeply within me. It's heartbreaking, and I understand it completely.
When he screams “I’m a vampire” I got the same chills as “can’t you see” from the drug in me. EPIC
wtf
I wish I was born on Valentine's day so I can always receive things like this from Ronnie on my birthday.
I stop listening to falling in reverse for 5 years and I come back to this masterpiece. It's like I put a wine away and brought it back out at its finest point 🙌🏾🙌🏾
still a better love story than twilight  (since no one else said it)
When he screams “I’m a vampire” I got the same chills as “can’t you see” from the drug in me. EPIC
Sooooo goooodd
That's exactly what a Vampire would say.
Ронни, спасибо за очередной шедевр.
Anjeng anjeng emang paling the best lah ini abang2anku ❤️ bikin merinding mulu
I love this song and video. The cinematic is perfect.
The pure talent in his voice is mesmerising.
BEST SONG BY FALLING IN REVERSE FOR SURE
Yes ronnie didn't think you could top the drug in me revamp but this is brilliant  Edited  Best song of 2021 no one will top this
What an Artist! 😍 legend! ♥️
I feel like I'm back in the Twilight Sagas, and Ronnie is part of the Volturi. Like Gahdam boiiii this shits a movie and I feel like I just watched an hour movie in 6:17 minutes
just love it when FIR turning those classic emo to goth.
I’m honestly in love with both versions of I’m not a vampire but this one hits so god damn hard it makes me wanna get up and do these fuckin power ranger poses 😂🤣
RIP DEREK JONES
Plot twist: He actually is a vampire.
THAT FUCKING HAIR THO. LOVE IT
Vampirean Rhapsody
This is genre spawning.
His voice tho   4:00 -4:21
Ooooh my gooood 😱😱😱 . I LOOOOOOOVE THIS SONG ❤
3:50  to 4:20 get super chills every time
Thank you  Your talent is beyond comprehension   Did you know you wanted to do these when you originally wrote these songs or do they come to mind later  At any rate just wow
I love yall as a band.. but this is trash frfr
SINK OR SWIM REVAMPED PLEASE!!!!
An actual musical genius
PLEASE MAKE ANOTHER RE
Dang, never knew he made movies.
H.O.L.Y S.H.I.T....😲 I felt like i just watched a 2 hour movie
If Queen of the Damned was made today, this would totally be the music for the ending credit scene.
Me gustan muchiiisimo las versiones nuevas que está haciendo. Son una pasada
This guy really makes me emotional lately and this song really hit a few heart strings
Dope.
I feel like I’ve aged with Ronnie and I’m so fucking proud of him ❤️
What was this ???  My ear don’t wanna listen to anything else now  Absolutely mind blowing
Absolutely spectacular!!! I'm so excited to hear what Ronnie revamps next. He is so incredibly talented.
Wow that was incredible
This is so beautiful, epic, and a Masterpiece. This is completely amazing.
I’m so glad to see paige 🥺🥺 I’ve missed her so much ,,,,
Ronnie out here becoming the king of rock opera
my mans built like a sickly founding father
What the fuck man, you are a god. You can turn every happy song into a sad poem, that. Is so fucking cool😍😍
In loving memory of Derek Jones.. I´m crying
Just do a Broadway play already
ever
"Hi my name is ronnie" gives me chills
The most intense song eve and my new favorite from FIR
It's good but if it's not broken don't try and fix it
That was fucking amazing
No
Words can’t express how amazingly talented Ronnie is...truly outstanding
Damn!!! Loved it😍
I literally gasped when I saw Paige in this! You two are adorable together omg 🥺 I love this so much
Omg paige😍
Ya we get it dude. You're a werewolf.
this was a cinematic experience and I enjoyed every moment of it
I hope he does the whole album
Absolutely loved it!!!
Total vampire diaries vibes!!!
Paige 🔥
We now know what a vampire should look like
I like the way ronnies hair is he needs to keep it like that
Emo Instrumental Revival. Ahead of his time.
If he doesn't make you cry from listening to this song then you're definitely a vampire 😭
imagine being one of the 1.2K !@$#nuggets that hit dislike..../smh - but OT, this is another absolutely amazing re-envisioning of one of their songs, and it delivers on every angle, also, how TF does Ronnie make every single one of these videos into a mini-movie?? idk, I've run out of accolades for these guys, start giving out the awards already
Can this WHOLE album be a movie..  -Thanks,  Everyone....
It's starting to get a little scary how much more talented Ronnie keeps getting. Dude's about to ascend into something
Blown away that was phenomenal!!!
Song on repeat!
That's so amazing😮😮😮
its truly amazing that the exact same song can make us feel something completely different. Its almost like this is how he wanted us to feel before, but he didn't know how to tell the story before. This is so beautiful. Ronnie can do anything with his voice and its really a thing of beauty. FiR is setting the bar so high and they never disappoint.
I found this band a couple days ago and his voice is stunning
can someone please make this into an 8D audio??
i love this so much!!
Ronnie BRAVO BRAVO !!!  ☺️
Revampired
I see what ya did, & extra points for the sweet nod to Interview With A Vampire 🧛🏻‍♂️
WOW!!!
Ronnie I love you so much but this is not it 😷😶
lol "revamped"  That was really beautiful
It's Youre not Aline,Saosin?ahsuhaua
Paige 😘
"Revamped," LOL. Nice. Found that more amusing than I should have.
Holy shit, didn't think I could love "I'm Not A Vampire" anymore than I do. Love the original still, and absolutely love this revamped version. Really looking forward to more reimagined versions of previous songs.
the song went from originally being so amazing and energetic to being so beautiful with an amazing music video to match, I love it so much
Derek :(
I feel like this is how Ronnie always thought of this song but didn't think people would get it, until now.
Is nobody gonna talk about the fact that paige is in the video
I JUST SAW THIS OMG AAAAAA
ЭТО ПРОСТО АФИГЕННО!!!!!!!!!!!! Невероятная работа каждого, кто участвовал в создании клипа и песни!! Ронни вообще бог вокала я в шоке!!!!!!!
So that's where Paige has been
more like "Revampired" lol
this was absolutely beautiful bravo.
YESSSSSSSS
3:41 oh shit my noodles
Nah
Really kinda makes me wish he would of screamed at least one of the  choruses in the old song now lol
I really hope he carries on this trend of redoing old songs- it makes for a really interesting study of his growth as an artist
Antes eran buenos,  que les pasó?
Of late just absolutely beautiful songs composed
Ronnie radke needs to do raised by the wolves. That would be so good!
ok but when is the “Good Girls Bad Guys” remake gonna drop
😍🎶🔊
Ho.......ly  shit is this good
Seeing Ronnie without his tattoos is like seeing a Lion with no Maine.
Very Very Very AMAZING
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 LETS RUN THESE VIEWS UP!!!
The one film clip he has kept his shirt on 😂
WHAT THE ACTUALLY FUCK I JUST HEARD RIGHT NOW....!!! WOW !!!!!!!!!!!
Can we get one of these for Bad Girls Club please 😂
I half expected to see Jeffree Star as part of the choir
What's with the fr.... coundownt`?! Dang! Eiher put it on or not ! This is  bummer
Masterpiece. Absolute art. I love him sm
This is a masterpiece of music. He is truly undeniably one of the most talented vocalists.
Awesome
Jaw dropped!... Wow... Fucking Wow!!! 💙💙💙
FIR with a Hans Zimmer sound. Absolutely amazing. Can't stop listening.
Im at a loss for words... I’ve already seen this 3 times and each time i cried(I’m not over exaggerating) I even made my mom watch the whole thing and even she loved it ! Dude I can’t say how much I love this. I genuinely think this could be one of my favorite songs of all time(of every genre)
This was totally awesome has to be in a vampire movie it's only right
Omg! RONNIE
Ron bon?
es hermoso
Ayo wtf that shit was intense as fuck
Ronnie is a true artist! OMG I am addicted to this masterpiece.
Paige?
Is it the same place where Princess castle was filmed? jazmin bean song, love this
Great job guys :0
Is that Paige?
The part when he says, "try to run, motherfucker, I AM VAMPIRE!" Is without a doubt the sickest fucking scene ever. Hair pops to attention ever god damn time. Beautiful
They should collab with Palaye Royale. And I love the vampire diaries reference of feeding a human vampire blood to heal them or bring them back to life
This reminded me that i need to continue reading 'seraph of the end'  Best vampire fiction ever
What a masterpiece, if this doesn’t win video of the year
Paige made her music video debut. Her and ronnie are a good couple.
I love ronnie and have mad respect for his artistic talent but I'm not feeling this one. I don't think this particular song is suited for a slower version.
YESSSSSSSS
This is INSANE in its overall quality especially production value. Love it!
IM A BIG FANN!
FIR, you've outdone yourselves again 👏👏👏
I love how you starred Saraya 💕
I absolutely don’t understand the dislikes.. This is Breath taking.. Goosebumps all the way through.. but I guess in this cancel culture you can’t please everyone.. Ronnie has the best voice I have ever heard.. and the most talented musician.. Amazing! I look so forward to The future of Falling in Reverse.. I’m so Happy for them
Love it!!
I want to see this movie
Hey, you know what? the songs kind of cheesy I get it. BUT I really dig the voice....
Surto coletivo
Me: "I dont get musicians who call themselves artists isnt that why we made the term musician?"  Me watching Ronnie: "Oh now that term totally makes sense"
Yes, yes, yes. Ronnie Radke is the King of the music scene. I really wonder how he feels. This genius takes a lot.. A real masterpiece, FiR overdo themselves Beethoven and Mozart was yesterday
Falling in Reverse music keeps growing better and better ♥️
No hate Ronnie, I’m a big fan. But you look like Ronnie Wiseau in this :O
This video needs to be made into a series
Epic...Masterpiece!!🔥🔥🔥
I was enraptured throughout the whole song! Dang he keeps outdoing himself! Freaking AMAZING!
The beginning sounds straight up like the metroid prime 2 title screen... and that's not a bad thing
Who else gets True Blood vibes at the ending?
Okay but Paige!! 👀❤️🥺
I am one of the lucky people who grew with your music. Early had fun energy. Middle the back and forth fighting between inner demons. Current the acceptance of everything and more powerful  thank you Ronnie and falling in reverse. I'm really looking forward to continuing to grow with your music. Incredible flawless. Keep them coming!
Awesome and thought provoking!!
anyone who dislikes this definitely has horrible taste in music
Legit, when is Ronnie coming out with a whole set of dark monster movie musicals? We’re waiting!!!!
This was so epic!!
Falling In Reverse: I Am Not a Vampire Also Falling In Reverse: ReVAMPed.
All types of rock > Rap
If 2020 robbed you from all your hope ronnie is your home to give it back to you. I'm truly blessed to be hit by all this nostalgia and new love for this song and their songs in general. Please get him an oscar he deserves it~♡
ohhhhh puta madre de video... desgarrador su voz en el episodio final... Eres un puto genio Ronnie! // ohhhhh motherfucking video ... heartbreaking her voice in the final episode ... You're a fucking genius Ronnie!
I really love this version of this song! It is like cure for my mind! Such a pleasure to my ears!
I kept keep getting chills 🖤🔥 Like This Music video is Just Insane! Man Like my heart ❤️ just Amazing Love your style of Music

INCREDIBLE!
Falling in reverse never failed to amaze me how they make their MV and not to mention also ronnie's vocal range

In loving memory of Derek Jones 😞💔
I wish he would start the song slow like that and then pick up at regular song pace then end slow again that shit would be fire
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏  This seriously needs an award!! Like. NOW.
I listen to this while falling asleep just built different
A masterpiece.
I feel like this shouldn’t have been messed with.
OmgomgomgomgomfOMFG yes!!!!!!!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️I love that he's revamping older songs 💯 thee besstttttt
Wow, great job
When I saw resorting to puns like "Revamped" in the title I just assumed this song would be garbage....I was wrong.
Popular monster has this beat hands down
Absolutely insane ronny
long hair ronnie
Ronnie is the best  emotional vocalist at this time.
Obrigado Ronnie Radke!
Another Classic. I wish they all were on an album
This is fucking awesome as nostalgic asf!!
Here because of Paige!
the hidden tattoos fucked me up i was like why does he look so different until i read the comments and someone pointed it out xD
Goosebumps. Chester vibes for sure. The vocal control is insane. I love this route youre taking between this and youre remake of Drug In Me. Please keep this going. This music is literally lifting my soul out of its body.  I feel every word. Much much love.
Ronnie has grown and matured so much since the escape the fate days. Ronnies singing and screaming has improved 1000%. Keep fucking doing what your doing!
Is there a superlative of masterpiece?
Holy shit
Came in very skeptical, left quite impressed.
I love the original, bit I think I love this one more. It sounds so much better.
this is amazing! i love this so much
I can’t stop replaying this he has an incredible voice
Ronnie and Paige need to make a Dracula film im invested!
the im a fucking vampire part at 5:00 chocked me up so  fucking powerful
This is shit. Stop it.
𝗪𝗢𝗪. 𝗝𝗨𝗦𝗧. 𝗪𝗢𝗪.
This is THE BEST music video I have EVER SEEN in my LIFE!! I am in awe!! I do have one question tho, can we get a remastered version of Loser to go along with the masterpiece? ❤❤ Much love to the band, Paige, and everyone involved for making this INCREDIBLE video/short heart wrenching story.
Fuck every media outlet for not pushing this to my attention until 3 days later
Ronnie tá bonitinha kkkkk
Puta merda
Ronnie's writing has always be amazing. But now, his interpretation is on another level, and that makes you really feel the lyrics in a totally new way.
cool song... I like mine better though... horsound.bandcamp.com/track/brian
This comment is for the old fogeys who remember the original album coming out and how excited we were to hear new music from Ronnie!
This song is amazing. So different to the original in every way. It touched my heart and as the song was getting more emotional, my heartbeat also was getting faster. I really want to perform on that song. I want to dance all my feelings for it. So unbelievable great!! Even better than "the drug in me is reimagined".
Ronnie, my dude, this video was like a whole MOVIE!!!! IM SHOOK!!! THIS WAS SO GOOD!!!
We get it you peaked early
wow this gave me chills, so amazing.
Incredible! What can he do next!
Hear me out. Chemical prison  Reimagined
Tim burton liked this song ( HIT SO HARD!!! )
AMAZING I LOVE THIS
Love, love, love this song so much and love the video more!!!!
https://youtu.be/Pg7pOnThpB4
Bad girls club next!
Falling in Feels
I don't know how he still has a voice after singing that. Hitting such strong high operatic sounds then drop down to a growl note and hold it like that. Then comes back to a beautiful sound again. It's amazing the skill. I hope he continues taking care of his voice over the years because, this is a talent not everyone can carry for years and years. The voice can wear down over the yrs as it is but, if he's doing to many concerts or not using his voice he could lose it. GREAT JOB RONNIE! YOU DID IT AGAIN!
✨✨H E R M O S O✨✨
this is so amazing Ö_Ö I love how there is so much emotion in the voice and how it is sung...beautiful :D
I forgot this band exsited
more like this one please :)
My high school heart is having a freaking heart attack
Lyrics  Well I'm not a vampire But I feel like one Sometimes I sleep all day Because I hate the sunlight My hands are always shaking Body's always aching And the dark is when I feed  Well I can lure any woman that I want to in my bed With me And whiskey seems to be my holy water Mothers better lock your doors And hide your daughters  I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness sake Where is my self control? If home is where my heart is Then my heart has lost all hope  Well I'm not a zombie But I feel like one today Self induced comatose, chemical daze  My head is always spinning From this dizzy, blurry vision And my stomach has had enough I feel like a lady That is pregnant with a baby 'Cause I'm always throwing up  Hi, My name is Ronnie I'm an addict (Hi, Ronnie!) Daddy should've never raised me on Black Sabbath!  I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness sake Where is my self control? If home is where my heart is Then my heart has lost all hope  God bless all of you now 'Cause I'm going straight to Hell And I'm taking you down with me 'Cause you know damn well  I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold?  I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness sake Where is my self control? If home is where my heart is Then my heart has lost all hope All hope
Ronnie omg you are a genius! Also you and Saraya look amazing!!
OH MY FUCKING GOD THIS ONE, OH THIS ONE I WAS LIKE "OKAY, NOTHING WILL BE BETTER THAN THIS SONG" SINCE DRUGS AND I'M JUST LIKE.. GOING INSANE, RONNIE IS AMAZING
This is a small masterpiece. Respect to the group. Bravo!
Bravo
Hell yes !!
Τhis is the version of the song that i wanted to hear..congruts guyz this is a masterpiece
BRAVISIMO!
Now comes Good Girls Bad Guys Right?
Beautiful. Just beautiful.
It's as if you were hearing an instrumental music by Frank Zimmer but with Ronnie's voice. A MASTERPIECE.
This is wonderful <3
Xjdjdi3idjdir did did dodge ridiculous diduudf do
Bkums
"Sometimes I sleep all day Because I hate the sunlight My hands are always shaking Body's always aching And the dark is when I feed"  well technically youve nailed my life lol
"re-Vamped" i love it lol
He looks like one of the Cullens now 😳
Drug in me reimagined and now I'm not a vampire revamped..... ??? Bless you! <3 please dont stop making these!!!! They bring tears to my eyes because they are so damn beautiful!!!
Is anyone else getting Meatloaf  version 2.0
Song for the morbius movie xD
Amo esto, es hermoso ❤🖤🤘
I just fell like i saw a whole two hours dracula movie, like an unknown version with a different end and without gary oldman, a true hidden gem. Dude is was so invested i gasped at the end, SO GOOD!!!
What a master piece im crying right now
Been a fan since the 6th grade , now I'm 22 ❤️.... No mom it's not a phase I swear
Wow that was beautiful
This man is special and so is his band.
Falling in reverse with thier crazy editing and Cinematic songs ughh the video it self worth a million dollar the song and the passion in it ughhh
🖤
So dramatic 😍 Ronnie is far ahead of the game fr! Love it!
EPIC
This video absolutely needs a billion views! Ronnie is a genius! Hands down the most talented musician today.
OOOO MYYY GOOOOOOD!!!!!!! THIS IS LEGENDARY !!!
Ini lagu lama ya.
fuckkkkkk I keep getting goosebumps the whole way through
Maybe Ronnie is a real vampire and we'll never know
Shouldve kept that vibe from "The Trinity" going instead of this theatrical stuff.
this is fucking epic
wow
REST . IN . PEACE. Derek Jones
I really they do more remastered versions of there songs really enjoyed the Drug in me remastered version
Where are the drums? What is this? :o
another masterpiece
To be honest, this is beautiful! I am not fully used to metal sounding this way, and I am glad some types do. I would have never understood any metal if Jacksepticeye hadn't did a few drum covers of metal songs. He loves System of a Down, and Chop Suey was his first drum cover. I eventually found a reaction channel, who reacts to metal music, and they reacted to this song a few hours ago. I wouldn't be in love with some metal types if I hadn't found Jack or the reaction channel.
So much powerful emotional forces in him. The power comes out in his singing.
I love the effort and theatrical twist. Love it
Ronnie with another FUCKING WIN.
I like the original version
I’m still in shock btw
Your voice is insane!
Fuck it,  make Ronnie morbius. This is absolute fire🔥🔥🔥
Why is it called revamp..........i get it because its a vampire!!!
He didn't have to go that far, but he did. Man my ❤
🖤 I wish this came out yesterday. yesterday was my birthday.
This is soooo good I need a clean version tho lol😂
Thank you for this another masterpiece, I had chills...   I am so happy to see Paige and so weird to see Ronnie without tattoos 😂
Ronnie I'm so sorry for the loss of your friend Derek, I know what you're feeling. My dad died late November from drug abuse. I've been clean 9 years and I tried to save him but I couldn't. This song is my new theme song. Its been stuck in my head for 3 days now. Thank you for all your hard work and dedication through a difficult time. Keep on keepin' on my dude.
Okay but who else cried at the shoutout to Derek Jones?
Still a better love story than Twilight... lmfao!!! Loved it! Amazing video!
The way music video should be. 99% of other videos are just playing musicians
Have you ever thought about being a movie producer part time Ronnie?
He is a vampire
Im in Love!  <3
Interview with a Vampire vibes are strong in there, beautiful. And - oh my gosh is this Paige? Oo wow..
Quite literally a super star
Ronnie is an absolute genius! This is heaven to my ears, he never disappoints
Is that Leah Michelle?
Ronnie is a beast a super talent i love reimagined & revamped i wonder what song is nxt
Paige is beautiful in this 💜
Fuck this is amazing 🥺
TRIGGER! I'm emo again
Epic
I think the chore men are the angry mob as well
His videos are on another level. So is his voice. F*cking brilliant once again.
This sucks.. really bad lol
It took me so many views to figure it out the vid. Its amazing. Hes a genius
Derek would love it <3 MASTERPIECE
Shes his vamp slave. Soulless.  Her spirit is watching. Also he looks like he don't like her as a vamp
Paige is drop dead gorgeous.  So is Ronnie.
Most underrated band ever..
He is his own worst enemy. His songs keep keep getting better , his voice ,vids. He is out doing him self each time. He is over working. Take a break ,Ronnie. This is a master piece.  U reminded me to buy and watxh interview w the vampire.
To be honest, it's much better than the drug in me is reimagined
Ronnie and the FIR guys all Amazing as always!  I love even the operatic overtones.
I was hoping for something new, but he does this, someone is pretty lazy lately...
Why haven't the comments mentioned how extremely beautiful Paige looks!
This is so fucking good. First song I've heard of them
His self control is his amazing beautiful voice
I am so in love with this Ronnie's voice just ughhhhh
I swear if this isn't going to be in Resident Evil 8...
2021 Bohemian Rhapsody
I get it. She is a spirit. She killed self is a ghost watching him n herself that is vampire body . Soul less
How old are these dudes?
I watched this so many times I can't get enough. . I watch reactors this and I can't stop. Hooked. I'm Lisa I'm a addict
It was one of the most BEAUTIFUL and POWERFUL song I've ever heard. Like "The Drug in me is Reimagined" was. And "Popular Monster". And "Drugs", "Losing My Life".....   Love you Ronnie
That spooky masterpiece deserve to be top 1 song!
Fuckin hell ronnie
Beautiful story love the vocal spectrum
So in love with this song 💜
🖤
This is epic lol
THIS IS A FUCKING MASTERPIECE!!
My vampiric obsession blooms with satisfaction after this discovery
Paige ?
That was fucking riveting, violent, elegant. And GD, Ronnie’s voice is so versatile and haunting. Somehow even singing about sad & disturbing things his voice is so beautiful I can’t stop listening to him? A Dark Angel, slightly mad, wholly unique....
Чтоб я сдохла товарищи.........Ронни,если тебе не лень было это перевести,то чувак ты крут,я просто все.......Стоит ли мне просить твоей руки и сердца,хоть я и девушка???(Я знаю,что он занят((((()
The pure talent that Ronnie has
OH MY GOD.
R.I.P. Derek, you will be missed...
One of the best things about this is that it keeps the original message of the song. He was a vampire (an addict), he lost control, he wanted blood (drugs) at all cost.
They put Paige in the video!!!! :D
After that, I just stared at my phone for a good 5min... damn. And Paige is gorgeous!!
this is fucking amazing
Ronnie is a genius
Beautiful 🤩
wtf
Ohhh shit sticks!!! Is that who I think it is?! Paige?! 😲😨
Totally amazing it was like a mini movie
This is a fucking Masterpiece. Visual effects, costume, everything is perfect.
Please make a revamped album
Ronnie es un genio de la música  Simplemente todas sus canciones son excelentes
HOLLY SHIT, SEVERUS SNAPE IS STILL ALIVE?
just amazing.
I actually wanna see the behind the scenes of this
falling in reverse has now become a gothic band??
I feel like a cult recruiter trying to make everyone in my life love Ronnie's music as much as I do.  Also, thank you Ronnie for the best Valentine's presents two years in a row!!
I love it so amazing
Never knew Ronnie could hit these notes. Now I want a metal ballad album from FIR.
Thanks, random YouTube recommendation. I will add this to my growing playlist of bad assery.
How can It be so breathtaking? Beautiful job guys!
Not that this isn't beautiful and a masterpiece but can we get more original music like this instead of remakes. The album will be a masterpiece of a lifetime 🤙🏼
Jeffery star ain't in this one version.
I almost forgot about his excessive tattoos .
This is my house :D
Definitely like this reimagined more than the first. That choir that came in surprised me, very well done. Great story!
Breathtaking
WOW
It is soundtrack for resident evil 8
DAMN, you put Paige in this perfect song!
Is there anything Ronnie can't do?! 😍😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
The original was great, especially for the time period it was the style and i still love it. But this version oh my goodness. The story telling in the way this one is sung is so incredible and this video for it is absolutely perfect! I love Ronnie and Saraya together like this. This video is literally a mini movie and its beautiful, it's sad, it's so powerful.  Ronnie just absolutely incredible work on this one. Good job. It must of taken a good while to come up with this storyline for the video to follow and create the ideal imagery for the way you sang it this way. Saraya of course looked amazingly gorgeous, Ronnie of course uber handsome. Love it love it love it all the way around, cannot find one tiny thing to complain about, of course some troll somewhere will fin something but as for me I think its breathtaking. Couldn't of been done better.
This was so epic, it should be played at the Super Bowl halftime show.
WOW
This dude is just insane with this . The level of his vision  just beyond exquisite
This is a masterpiece
I'm still crying
This is seriously incredible. Ronnie is a legend. He inspires so many people to keep going and to be the best they can be. Beyond grateful for this man
I adore this version
This song is very greatfull awesome Great Job Ronnie
I believe in Paige! Ronnie si fantastic
Gut wrenchingly beautiful..
This is how music should be! Every time I listen to it my whole body feels every inch of this song. I get a massive range of goosebumps all over and tears in my eyes because it moves me deep within on so many levels. This is Art at its absolute perfection!
“Drug in Me Reimagined” “Popular Monster” and “I’m a Vampire revamped” = Pure joy when listening! Amazing work.
Oh no, I'm crying 💔 incredible!! 🖤
It's a young Aro (twilight)
only this music video im wonder, where's all of his tattoos goes?
Yo Ron, can you colab or beef with Tom MacDonald already?  We (the fans) need to know who is going to be the King. Maybe Dana White can set y'all up in Abu Dhabi. Real fight, rap battle, tag match? I'd pit you and Tom against anyone.
Great work, but the vampire theme is deader than zombies.
he already did  a werewolf, vampire... here it comes a frankstein... hahahah awesome music and video
But the solos. I mean this is theatrical magic. But when i was a kid this album shook we to the core and made me pick up an axe. I suppose different times call for different art. Good job mate
Ronnie should have been playing Morbius in the new film
Still a better love story than twilight
Wow, what a production!!! This version is so much better than the original 🔥
Another lvl
Chicago loves your voice brothose vocals are out of this world great video too by the way the energy I felt it the emotion everything on point told the story too very creative
Holy shit! That was awesome!
Jesus Christ this is epic...
Loving this sooo much! It’s everything a horror fan like me wants! It’s so good! It’s Interview with a vampire (yes the movie) it’s every Dracula movie, omg I can’t stop! Wow! Hat’s off to you Ronnie and the band! Bravo!
I went down a few music rabbit holes during the lockdowns, Ronnie's whole career story is one of the best.. yeah late to the party, but seems like not too late and it's just getting better.
Holy hell Ronnie voice is getting really good with age
in memory of Derek jones❤ r.i.p fuiste grande!!!!!
I hate that my volume only goes to 10.
Curtains close 🎬
why u gotta dieewhcwiud SURVIVE HAHAHA
My chills got chills.   This is amazing!
i love this song,  quedo genial saludos desde Sudamérica chile
Radke is awesome and really talented. Love when he swaps genres
Is this supposed to an interview with a vampire like I get serious vibes from that movie while watching it
Epic
This was fire🔥
Mozart, Bach, Vivaldi, Chopin, Beethoven... It is a privilege to be able to listen to their music in this day and age... But its an even greater privilege to be able to witness Ronnie and his genius, and to share this brief moment in the sun with his creation... Thank you Ronnie, every song has a place under the skin
Im actually in love with this omg
Who tf is disliking such a timeless masterpiece?!
Ronnie has to play in a new Anne Rice movie/series!
I just loved the video, Ronnie's voice is awesome, but lyrics doesn't convince me at all :P
unbelievable just breath taking
>Insert Ben Solo shouting "MORE!" meme here<
Holy. Shit.
I’m officially deceased
What a 😳... . . . . . 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Holy shit...
Охуетительно. Ниебически - эпически. Чётко.
I LOVE IT

Director: How much do you want the videoclip to be epic and theatrical? Ronnie: Yes.
Bit dramatic ain't it......
luv it from indonesia ;)
Ronnie decided to try out the roles of popular monsters, good restyle!
epic
goosebump for real bro...this is lit!
Bravo sir. Bravo....
Is that Paige?
I’m not a vampire,  can’t help falling in love. Two great songs sung by two talented singers.
You should do a song and have lindsey sterling in it!!!!
Nailed it AGAIN!!!! YOU ARE A LEGEND!!
3:32 avenged Sevenfold vibes
OMG THIS IS AMAZINGBSOKDEKOSLEKD

I’m in love with every song and wow Ronnie

WTF ! RONNIE IS A VAMPIRE !
Сколько раз переслушивать и просматриваю это видео это чудесно. Сюжетные линии, а голос вы лучшие
Epic video! I love Ronnie's voice! I've been listening for his voice since i were 19, now i'm 32 and i'm still loving you!
Fuck! Goosebumps all over my body! Geez! 😭
beautiful
🖤🖤
No but I get chills everytime I listen to it. I'm wrecked, such a masterpiece.
can u believe this guy. another epic.
Now THIS is the vampire content i was expecting the first time around
Re'vamped' Oh boy
Well fuck me Ronnie went all in this time huh?!  I dig it, gothic gospel rock with a meatloaf-esq aesthetic and a pretty epic video.  How do you go from hair metal to neon Tokyo screamo and rap to classical and then opera infused metal?????!!!!! Kudos 👍
It’s not 2009 lol emo I’d dead.
It's like The original version represents what one show on the outside. It's kinda upbeat while this one just represents how one is struggling on the inside.
This is incredible and stunning and so hauntingly beautifully done 🥰
This is an absolute MASTERPIECE. So weird with tattoos covered up lol.
breathtaking.
Yes!!! 💖 😌 ✨ 💖
Crazy how he learnt Jacky’s solo on keys
His voice sounds so good 😩 sounds like he’s been taking care of his vocal cords 🔥
Wtf is wrong with the people who disliked this😭😭 I cried it was so beautiful!!!
What a masterpiece, the voice, the lyrics and the cinematography. Total bliss, whoever has not seen this yet, do watch otherwise you're missing one of the beautiful song of this decade.
When she woke up in the bedroom at the beginning, she was a ghost. Just like some sort of flashback, she saw what they had been though. They were couples, they love each other but she didn't know he is a vampire. He killed people secretly and bury the bodies. Because she loves him, she helped him to keep secrets. Maybe when he haunts his prey he also damaged his clothes so she helped him to fix that and clean up the blood. One day she cannot take that anymore, they had a fight and she left.  After she leaves, he lost her, he lost his hope and his self control just like the lyrics said so he killed a lot. One of the man or woman tried  to shop him with a gun. Because of love, she came back to his castle, she heard a gunshot. When she ran into the room, she saw  him drinking people. He fear her to know so he ran away. She called the police and told the truth, then she killed herself in the bathroom.  When he came back to the house,  she was dead. He can't accept that so he turned she to a vampire. When she came back to live, the angry villagers was already there. He knew that she doesn't want him to be a killer so he didn't escape. He just wanted her to live.  The last part he was screening in the song, that was his last struggle But he didn't resist for redemption cause  that was what she hoped.  He finally killed by the sunlight and she followed him to death. THIS IS A FUCKING MOVIE!
when Ronie shows playboi carti whose the og vamp
amazing
Hollywood should consider taking on Ronnie for the role of Count Dracula
Ada wwe womens PAIGE
Ronnie Radke, you are the best artist there is or was. You continue to set the bar so high for everyone else and then somehow come back and surpass yourself each time. Fucking amazing song in every single way. Lucky to be alive in your time
I've listened to "Hi my name is Ronnie, I'm an addict." 9,839,672,211,683,822,762 times
Can anyone imagine popular monster reimagined
My fucking feels. I need this whole album revamped
He is not a vampire, he is a popular monster
So fucking powerful!!! Ronnie's range always blows me away!
THIS WAS SO FREAKING GOOD!!!
Worthy of Dereks name.Quality content.Jensen and Ronnie are one hell of a combination
If Tim Burton made a vampire movie staring Ronnie the scene would probably explode.
Fck yeaaa! Get better with time.
He looks like loki and professor snape
This was fucking incredible
This guy should be awarded for somthing big cus this is hella hard to recreate asong again 2 times!
its so fking good
Holy watAAAAaaaAaaR 1:13
AMAZING!!! LOVE FROM SPAIN!
When is it time for Ice Nine Kills and FIR to pair up and make an epic album. They both are so good at creating these iconic music videos and tell such great stories through their music. I think it could be pretty kickass.
This is a epic, next step : musical comedy show 🔥
Wow
I had to pause the video just to comment how INSANE Ronnie's voice has gotten. Jesus Christ when you compare these songs you can see amazing growth and these incredible remakes empower it so well.
EPIC
Love Paige in this!
Ronnie you good dude...
Ehh.
Oh my God!!!😭😭😭I'm cryin😭😭😭, he is Sooo damn good, I can't hardly breath.
Not enough people appreciating Paige here!
Well I'm not a vampire But I feel like one Sometimes I sleep all day Because I hate the sunlight My hands are always shaking Body's always aching And the dark is when I feed  Well I can lure any woman that I want to in my bed With me And whiskey seems to be my holy water Mothers better lock your doors And hide your daughters  I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold?

THE WORST THING ON YOUTUBE IN ALL THE YEARS YOUTUBE HAS existed. That’s not even describing the depths of “its fucking personal now.” Who ever these people are. Took 3 writers to fuck up more then anyone ever could writing a song. me letting you know you done fucked up. 💌💋
How fucking Gorgeous does Ronnie look? <3 Like fuckkkk next vamp or supernatural movie pls cast him! Oh my =) That voice to, So powerful.
Fuuuuuuck... this ist fucking amazing!
Ronnie my man I love you ... I've been a fan since that first "Not Good Enough For Truth In Cliché" in the desert video, and I have grown up with you. In my honest opinion, you are the greatest artist to have ever lived. no one has to agree, but for me at least. Keep them coming.
Fucking BRILLIANT. BRAVO
INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE VIBES ANYONE???
Brilliant
This is movie, change my mind.
I listen to the original and is hype, and now this............... I don't know why I'm cry....but is just to beautiful...to beautiful Original=8/10  Revamped=20/10
Is listening to the same song 30 times in 2 days normal? 💀✋
new version of Marilyn Manson :0
I like it but I want new stuff
I love this bro :') for Derek 🖤
"Raised by wolves - rewolved" to the next year?
Epic
See, now I have no choice but to listen to every song.
It wasn't a phase mom.
Mantab lur
Ahh chills, literal chills
Ronnie, dude....My kids introduced me to your music when they were teens. Escape the fate days, we were destroyed when it ended. When you came back we were so excited. They are married now, with kids of their own and we still follow your music. Love it! When I saw "The drug in me is reimagined" I instantly called them all...it was amazing to enjoy that as adults. It is a work of art....again you surprised us with this. I can say I knew what to expect, I was wrong on so many levels. This version of "I'm not a vampire-Revamped" is AMAZING! It draws you in and captures your attention and grabs you. The attention to detail and cinematic value  of this is absolutely incredible. Impressed and thankful that you share your talents with us. Thank you so much for all you do. Keep going man, love it!
Straight out of hell😊
Oh man. Ronnie still showing us how much he kills it...and how strong his hair game is. Holy crap. Haha
Ronnie is looking like a Renaissance painting without his tats
lol when i saw this my first thought was ‘i bet paige would be good in this she could play a vampire ‘ and i was right she fit
Dios mio esto es taaaan pero tan bueno que exigo que lo pongan en alguna película o algo, no debe ser desperdiciada esta obra de arte!
I'm so glad Ronnie stuck with the classic vampire, like Dracula or Le'stat de Lioncourt, instead of drawing inspiration from Twilight
He's been changing his great songs into masterpieces these new versions show the feeling and meaning of the song so much better it's really wonderful.
how phantom of the opera of you, ronnie
I didn't think that this song could get any better, but I rest my case.
Ok i think I'm in love with this shit
They should just give Ronnie a Grammy already.
Not bad
YES!!!!!!
This should be on top trending right now...come on guys he deserves this
😍😍😍😍😍🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
this indeed sent shivers down my spine
Flashbacks are showing during this song goes on, Ronnie always surprises us with his AMAZING creativity.  If you are reading this Ronnie, I want you to know, you are a true ICON.
Wow paige the wrestler is in this video
Better than twilight
1:47 Ronnie looks like Davey Havok in Girls Not Grey
🔥🔥🔥
holy forking shirtballs
Чё он поёт?
Plz ve in a Tim Burton movie
Ronnie has a godly voice
That look reminds me of young Dani Filth
DIOS
He sounds so much like Andy Black when he says "so God bless all of you now" and I can't get over it
Okay Youtube, can I leave more than one like please? Because I'm watching it for the 5th time already
When did I become so cold?
Just beyond what I expected... that crescendo at the end holy HELL... gorgeous vocals dynamics 🤯🤯🤯
WHY IS NOT ONE TALKING ABOUT THAT HIGH NOTE AT THE END?!
🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🖤🖤🖤
THIS IS AMAZING OMG
It's even BETTER with headphones on!!!!❤️
At 3:30 I thought it was turning into the Dracula music from forgetting Sarah Marshall hahaha
this is your best work dude
amazing
He will get a Grammy
Should have been called I'm Not A (re)Vampire
Someone needs to check on Ronnie, I think quarantine is finally getting to him
The vibes are just... *chef's kiss* this is AMAZING.
You.
I swear I’m 13 rediscovering ronnies voice for the first time all over again!
Couldn’t even watch all of it. Childish lyrics. So bad smh
Cool and all but it doesn't really work with this song
Checkout my reaction to this
Holy shit .-. that made me cry
🔥🔥
Anyone who's a fan of wwe will know who that girl is
This was not what I expected but in the best way possible. I love it.
i could already imagining this song in a movie
Can a song like this reach billions of viewers, while K-Pop songs can achieve it  It's really a beautiful song and it's a beautiful masterpiece too ♥️💞
Truly a masterpiece. Beautiful music, beautiful storytelling
Шедевр!
This is amazing! Once again another masterpiece! I swear I will always be a fan!
The be honest some parts reminded me of some of Danny Worsnop's style, but ronnie executed it better
My heart is melting
fucken hell
I think we have a little easter egg game going on here.  Popular Monster used the court room set of The Drug in Me is You (Drug in Me is You Reimagined is the next release)  Drug in Me is You Reimagined has Ronnie wearing vampire teeth (Im Not a Vampire Revamped is the next release)  Do we have an easter egg in this video?
Holy shit!!!! Amazing 👏
Such emotion,I love it
WELL DAMN.
Wow seems like this is the best era
Это шедевр 😍я будто книгу энн райс прочитала. Атмосфера просто шикарная 🔥а голос потрясающий
Well done
This is incredible!
This man is so fucking underrated
Ballad....killed it
Just do the whole damn album cause DAYUM 😩
My God
OMG PAIGE!!!!!!
The people who had dislike this video really have the bad choice in music... 2 min of silence for them...
I love this song, but am I the only one who wants a new album and not just old tracks remastered?
due this part was fucking amazing 5:45
This is badass! Ronnie killing this shit! And Paige be looking fucking beautiful as always!
Is this Peter's updated version of his Dracula musical from Forgetting Sarah Marshall?! Lol
Ronnie seriously needs to just make short films. I loved watching this more than listening. I honestly forgot I was listening to my highschool throwback.
Stunning! Just stunning! Love it!
Ronnie Kojima
1.25 le da el toque especial :)
goosebumps
For some reason the Manson they used looks familiar, the stairs do anyway
Oh. My. Gosh. Wow that was awesome. Literally hear his range as the song progresses 💙
They lost their sound, wish bands would keep making music without trying to change and stay relevant
Like the way he show versatility in his voice. Hop here a bit late..Ronnie Rocks 🔥
Okay we all realise this is absolutely bad ass but can we give a hand to the makeup crew for covering the tattoos. Hmm?
Gonna Tell My Kids this is *Professor Severus Snape*  . . . . . . . . . yup...Always
Ronnie your voice is just so beautiful 🖤🖤 I can feel your emotions in all you songs!
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS!!!! AAAHHHHHH ITS SO GOOD!!!!😁😁😁😁😁
Well I do not know... I didn't like it. The previous works were better.
FUCKING MASTERPIECE!!
When that key change hits.
GOD DAMN!!! 😳
Paige looks brilliant! :-) Great song so far!
Wow love them both & am so impressed! Chills all over! 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
Wwe paige
This is awesome, I'm not a vampire is one of my FIR fav songs. Thank you for the birthday gift (?)
Well, I'm not a vampire, but I feel like one Sometimes I sleep all day 'cause I hate the sunlight My hands are always shaking Body's always aching, and the dark is when I feed Well, I can lure any woman that I want to in my bed with me And whiskey seems to be my holy water And mothers, better lock your doors and hide your daughters 'Cause I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold? For goodness sakes, where is my self-control? If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all hope Well, I'm not a zombie, but I feel like one today Self-induced comatose, chemical daze My head is always spinning from this dizzy blurry vision and my stomach has had enough I feel like a lady that is pregnant with a baby 'cause I'm always throwing up And hi, my name is Ronnie, I'm an addict And daddy should've never raised me on Black Sabbath I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold? For goodness sakes, where is my self-control? If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all hope When will you mortals believe? (He's not a vampire) I just want the world to bleed (He's not a vampire) Lust at the sight of your blood (He's not a vampire) I swear to God, I am not a— (He is not a—) (He is not a—) So God bless all of you now 'Cause I'm going straight to Hell (Straight to Hell) And I'm taking you down with me Because you know damn well So I sharpen my teeth 'cause I love the way it feels When I sink into your skin and draw the only thing that's real You don't believe me, should I write it in blood? You better drive that fucking stake right down my heart and try to run Motherfucker, I'm a vampire And I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold? For goodness sakes, where is my self-control? If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all Heart has fucking lost all Heart has lost all hope (He's lost all hope) (He's lost all hope) (He's lost all hope) All hope, my heart has lost all hope
And the sun finally rise, wow it sucks.
I swear Falling in Reverse's last three songs have been giving me goosebumps. It's insane how much Ronnie's voice improved. I mean that part towards the end is absolutely incredible. He's so amazing at doing the sing scream while conveying so much emotion and adding bone chilling gritt to his voice. And adding to that this video is phenomenal as well. The story telling and the whole vibe of it is on point
This is some Meatloaf vibes and I'm here for it.
Someone watched the Blade Trilogy
epic!!
Meu deus, eu tava esperando por isso e nem sabia
His voice just keeps getting better . love his music been listen to him sense escape the fate when i was in middle school. he gives me hope. and makes me keep pushing through life.
Jesus!!! Dude how could he be. More amazing sheesh
Rest in peace Derek Jones😓🎸🎸
He almost davey havok from AFI..still dope asf tho
Raised By Wolves please omg
Brooo this is the first time ive clicked so fast
This is 🔥🔥🔥 reminds me of dark shadows 🥰
geez Ronnie without tattos its too weird... i past half of the video wondering is that Ronnie?
Man the second part had him singing with so much passion. That's some good stuff.
That's Paige right
I've been around since not good enough for the truth in cliche, back when ronnie was escape the fate, and it's been interesting watching his music evolve.  I love seeing the turn in his style over the last 15 years.  Hes more than creative, and everything is always new and unique from the last.  His music speaks to so many levels of life and I love it.
This has officially made Falling In Reverse the best rock band to ever exist in my opinion because  nobody has ever done anything remotely close to what they have done..
Ronnie "god" Radke
Pissed, thought he was gonna popular monster on the badies.
Loved it
I LOVE IT RONNIE!! In memory Derek Jones Fly high 🕊️
The piano, the choir, the lyrics and the voice this is what makes this song fucking awesome. The video is the proverbial cherry and whip cream on top of this musical sundae!
Paige🤩😍🥰
Gonna tell my kids he was Davey Havok
I love it! 😭🤧❤️
1:12 "So we finally meet"
In another universe this is the main villain's final ballad in a late 90s Disney animated musical.
I love this Ronnie you’re so talented !❤️
First a werewolf, now a vampire. What's next?
He sure does look like a Davey Havok on the piano. Really loving this side of Ronnie. Hope this becomes an entire album of revamping and reimagining. Would make a great musical movie 😄
It's alright
if this becomes some tiktok song ima jump off a building :/
This is couple goals at Its highest
Who knew Ronnie had some fucking pipes that could make me tremble. This is amazing ❤️ masterpiece 👌
Ronnie Radke is aging like fine wine with his music.
I teared up watching this ! holy shit ! so amazing !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This send shivers down my spine wow
Wow
I feel like this would sound better with a different singer  just would fit the music better with a more feminine voice or smth
PERFECT
I don't know what I like more the originals or the revamps it's different hearing something you've become so accustom too you know
Very punny title
"In loving memory of Derek Jones" that hurts me like shit... but this was amazing , i was almost crying, i love it
Revamp..!!!
Ronnie should be an actor in a movie or direct a vampire movie.
That was a fucking story, it's amazing, I hope this is just the start
this music remember me "A little piece of heaven" from Avenged Sevenfold, THANK YOU !!!!!!!
Nobody here gonna comment on the pun in the title? :P
I'm insane!
Wow, this absolutely blew me away!! Loved seeing the beautiful Paige in this! Would love to see more like this! Bravo!
Jesus fucking christ! Love it !
it would be perfect if this was released in Halloween
I love that Ronnie and Paige are finally in a video together! I love their relationship! She's the reason I started listening to Falling In Reverse a few years ago.
How cute Ronnie and Paige in a video together they are a good couple
My 7 year old deaf son has cochlear implants. He loves movies and gory stuff.. LOVED THIS AND CLAPPED AND ASKED TO WATCH IT AGAIN!!
Kinda waiting for a revised good girls bad guys

lindo demais vou chorar
Ronnie playing piano hits different
Edgar Allen Poe who?
OH PERIODDD
How does this not have Infiniti views?
simply beautiful
Ronnie you are the unique artist who turns music into a masters songs you are a faking genius thanks to you i reinvent my life...
One of my favorite songs...the first album i heard from them...the reimagined version is cool too
This was crazy good. Radke for life!
Chills. Literal chills.
The added lyrics are on point
So this is another song that I'll be adding to my must plays on Halloween along with a little peice of heaven
Ronnie didn't have to flex that hard at the beginning of the year, all other artists have nowhere to go from here. Hardly anything is going to top this
I've been listening to this band since I was 12 I'm now 20 and I still have a deep connection with their music I love falling in reverse and ronnie you keep on killing it   This band is awesome
is my new favorite drug lol
literally freaking increadible the movie of this was phenomenal and for the overall ending to be in memory of derek, R.I.P. derek there is no one that could ever replace you
The ending was great it gave me goosebumps and sent shivers down my spine 😎
We need a popular monster one of these
Question to the band: Vampire or Warewolves?  Ficcaro: Vampire Radke: Warewolves, coz we are raised by the wolves. So you are not in the band Ficcaro: Dammit
Muito foda
This song better be on Morbius the Living Vampire soundtrack
Ronnie should do acting. I bet he'd be great.
Wow! No words to explain the feeling to listen this song in this version :')
Hands down
damn it Ronnie you are always Upgrading!
So... she just gonna go die after reviving her ?
I feel like this was a love letter to Queen of the Damned. If none of you have seen it, then give it a watch. 👌 movie. Edit: i know this is a rework of a previous song.
Playboi Carti better
Genius! I want more! Can Ronnie produce a theatre musical already
Que obra prima amigos, que obra. Fico triste por tu não ser tãooo reconhecido assim, pois tu merece. Não ficaria surpreendido se ganhar um prêmio.
Low key you should make this a show i would watch
If this doesn't receive a Grammy then i don't know what willl...I'm speechless...
So dope love it
Still a better story than Twilight.
I’m getting underworld, Frankenstein, & twilight vibes from this video.
FIRE!!!! Ronnies screams are just perfect <3
Ronnie really made that chick die twice for what..lol
The part before the solo is the best add on
This is beautiful
Low key remind me of Tom Hiddleston as Loki
I love that you guys are redoing some of your older songs
Fuck. Raised by wolves next
Anyone here for Paige?? *Huge WWE fan here* 🙌🏻🙌🏻
This is Epic!
Really Paige lmao 🤦‍♂️
Absolutely beautiful. The vocals, the talent....EVERYTHING is astonishing.
Getting mad Anne Rice vibes and I love it!!
My God...this guy <3
Ha you did the chorus like you wanted in drug in me reimagined. That’s awesome. Perfectly done.
CAPOLAVORO
Can my vampire the masquerade peeps confirm that Ronnie is 100% a toreador?
Who the hell are the 1100 people who cant appreciate this!
Não sei o que tá acontecendo com essa banda mas eu tô gostando kkkkk
Nah this aint it, the drug in me is you is dope, but this kinda sucks ass
Ronnie with long hair omfg
Feels like i just watched a movie! Wow😲
This was the first FIR song I ever heard back in 2016, and holy shit, this version gave me goosebumps the whole way through. It’s absolutely perfect.
JFC, this is a masterpiece. Had me bawling when he found her in the tub. OMG. I'll stop here...the spoilers. I should have done a react video, still just bawling my eyes out. Bravo. Paige is just stunning, just absolutely stunning. Love that you have her in the video.
2 of my favorite ppl together omgggg love it.
IM DYING
Ronnie just convinced me that he is actually a vampire
Fuckin sick dude well done Ronnie
How epic was that !  Always knew that you were both vampires 🧛‍♂️🧛‍♀️
I cried at the end of this... you can feel the raw emotion and it's amazing... RIP Derek Jones....
La cura del coronavirus
Guys, go to The Drug In Me Is Reimagined at the minute 2:50 and you will see something interesting you might not noticed
RONNNIE
Popular monster, drugs, losing my life. The best ever. This song  not a real FIR
Me: "Imma cover th..." Vocal Chords: "I don't think so..."
R.I.P     Derek Jones
100% here for paige
😲😲😲 Beyond EPIC! 💓💓💓
Damn, these remakes 😏 revamps are amazing.
Me before watching this video: oh god, not another remake, another band trying to make more money of old songs... THEN IT TURNS OUT TO BE EPIC AS FUCK AND QUALITY 100% LIKE USUAL!!
Twilight vibes
Holy fucking shit, that hit soooo harddd
#fallinginreverse, All I can say was "WOW!" Music and lyrics were dark, and depressing sad but 110% beautiful and heartfelt. Bravo #Ronnieradke Bravo!
Always find the way to catch me again
We are not worthy. We are not worthy
Perfeição do Caralho
"In loving memory of Derek Jones"  😔 ♥ 🙏🏼
Hasn’t paige been in enough movies?
Absolute trash. His voice doesn't work for this style of music. Tell him to stop making such garbage music.
Thought for sure her was gonna wreck those guys in the screaming part 💔☠️
ronnie channeling oldskool AFI vibes
Bravo 👏🏽 bravo 👏🏽
I don’t know which one I like more
I love this so, so, very much Gives me interview with a vampire vibes and it is such so good
HOW COME THEY DONT AGE I LOVE THEMM
Está bien chingón 🤘🏼😎
chills
Ронни знай ты Легенда и гений !
You should make a musical or play
Now I'm waiting for popular monster to be reimagined like the drug in me is you and I'm not a vampire
I can’t stop listening every moment this song is amazing in both ways, even if I don’t put it on is in my head 🎶🎶🎶 all the time.
CARALHOOOOOOO
My childhood. Not the band, but the days i lived .
Someone’s been watching vampire diaries
Goosebumps! This truely is a vampiric masterpiece.
I-I THIS IS FUCKING AMAZING! IM LITERALLY IN LOVE WITH! RONNIE DID SO AMAZING IN THIS! I HAD FUCKING CHILLS !
I fucking knew he’d be making a revamped of this song!!! I’m so fucking happy omg. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ Ever since I saw him in ‘The drug in me is you’ with those vampire teeth I knew he was going to make it. ❤️❤️❤️
I'm fucking crying. This is amazing.
The girl at the end U👄U🤚
Paige ❤
hi ronnie 🤯
you have done it again ronnie..... hairs standing up on my neck bro... mad track
He kinda looks like Tom Hiddlestons Loki
Fucking yes
i just can said LOL
Should check out in fear and faith’s album symphonies. Exactly like this style
I think I finally figured it out. And I LOVE IT it's very romantic and 🌑 dark.
Ta Muittooo profundoooo ❤🤤🤤🤤
Ronnie reminds me of Thomas Sharpe in this video
This song is sooooo good!!! I’m addicted😆
In my honest unprofessional opinion, Ronnie radke is one of the most vocally gifted and talented male human beings on the planet earth. I rank him right up there with the best of them.
I'm a popular, popular VAMPIRE!!!
Esto es brutal genio 🙏💯👏
Ronnie can you stop.     It’s too good.  I AM GOING TO CATCH ON FIRE FROM THIS SONG!!! 🔥
This music is so powerful. Thank you for that.
this guy has such a strong voice and the music compliments that perfectly
We miss you Derek!
No one is ever gonna be able to beat him in the music scene
I hate the talent this guy has... Goes back and makes his previous songs EVEN BETTER! The title couldn't have been even more fitting "I'm not a Vampire" (REVAMPED) <---- See what they did there.. *Slaps knee*
Wow o.o
I'm speechless...amazing !  Now I want an entire movie !
🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆+
Ronnie is such a fucking brilliant man!!!!
Nice choreography, nice singing too, but I just like "the drug in me reimagined" better.
Omfg amazing!  Please do Raised by Wolves next!!!
For so long I languished in anticipation of a new single, thinking over hundreds of options for the future work of the group after the death of one of the members. My mind is amazed at the scale of the work done and is even more immersed in dreams from the performance with the orchestra. Bravo! It's better to see once than describe it a hundred times!
I'll be honest I stopped listening to falling in reverse after the drug in me is you album I loved every song on it but I just wasn't a fan of where they went with the second album but hey that's just me nothing against it but man these reimaging? Are beautiful amazing work
Why does this not have over 10 million views yet?
The video is great, but why do the good old songs always have to be changed into "new" ones? I would have liked a new song to go with this video, because I think the old ones are great as they are. Very sad.
The woman in this video looks like Rebecca Black
EMOTION. IS. REAL.
Epic. These remakes are just amazing.
A Masterpiece - this has taking the game to a whole new level, the progression throughout this left me in a fit of tears at the end. Art, Talent, Musical Masterpiece.
Love that it’s re-VAMPED (vampire) instead of reimagined
These guys had a concert in my school before. I don’t even know why
you guys never fail man
Paige  ⚡🙏
I’m not sure on this tbf xx
I have always loved Paige's look, she is and was always so gorgeous.  But I gotta admit, I liked how she looked before she got alot of work done.
You're singing is fucking awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Dude. This is incredible. Only when youve done it right does it give me chills. This gave me all the goosepimples i needed lol
La chica parece Lali Espósito
The woman is Paige from WWE.
Ronnie rozjebaleś...
Very disappointed. Falling in reverse isnt a sappy mushy love song band. If youre honna start as a heavy band, stay a heavy band. Same thing with disturbed. They started heavy af, and "immortalized" is the last album that had more than 2 decent songs on it. Same with A7X as well. Their music has declined as well. Stop bending to the will of the people and making shit music just to keep your "fans." If staying a heavy sounding band wasnt your end goal, you shouldnt have begun as one. Very disappointed Ronnie.
ok so im crying
Came to YouTube to discover Motionless In White, ended up stumbling on this ballad by one of my lifesavers. I guess MIW can wait.
my apocolypse next please.
DUDE THIS IS MASTERPIECE, SHOULD BE IN LOUVRE AT MONALISA'S PLACE
Damn. Love it.
Cool
That is a Masterpiece OMG!!!
Wow... this is amazing..
Oh man oh man please keep making these. You are a musical genius stg
Almost as good as "The Drug In Me Is Reimagined" ! Make a whole reimagined album pleaaaaase !!
I was wondering when Paige was going to be in your videos.
Paige❤️
Horrible. Horrible. Yikes
weird to see ronnie with no tattoos😂
never thought id see the day where id be crying to this song
Fucking yesss this was another one of my all times favorites!!!!KEEP IT UP!!!🎃💘
The score to this movie is amazing.😊
A Masterpiece in every aspect. This is pure art! I am so freaking happy that Ronnie just exists and blesses us with his music.  I try to think of a more talented individual in the music scene but I can't name anyone. He is absolutely amazing!
Guys its absolutely brilliant so much emotion like watching a movie im lost for words
there’s a lot of emotion in this. especially in the end. love it
Bonechillingly good...
Omg I didn't think I could love this song or band anymore then I already do! Then boom u bring this bad boy out wat a killer, Well done gentlemen 👏
"Ronnie Radke" is the true definition of talent... You don't believe me, should I write it in blood?
“This sounds like” headass people are clearly tone deaf, huh?
RIP Derek🖤
When Falling in Reverse turns from emo to symphonic metal
Wow this is so EPIC !!! XD
Okay you’re literally living art Ronnie 🥺💕
Masterpiece...just....WOOOW
I’m in love with this!!!!! Do all your songs like this!!!!!!!
Nossa fiquei arrepiado
Wow. Just wow😍
Talk about a mf masterpiece. Holy Crap. This was so damn good.
💖💖💖
RIP Derek Jones!
Господи, это великолепно
IMAGINE A WHOLE BROADWAY PRODUCTION OF THIS
Bout time Paige gets her a music video!!! SOLID STUFF!!!
*pppppffffhhhhh* this was so fucking stupidly amazing. 🤦🏻‍♀️🖤
Ronnie without tattoos is the trippiest thing
EMOtional Vampire ™͡๏̯͡๏
I love how they turned their old song into a theatrical piece. Absolutely amazing! Hope they’ll do more of this.
WOW
I came here bcoz of Paige but now I'm a fan of Ronnie, this is the real music bro 🔥
Aight now where's McNastys comment
Saraya Jade...AKA...Paige...Definitely fit the role for this video !!!
Man that was a great revamped version of that song. Well done Ronnie.
3:50  man the part I loved the most
Okay we need to have Ronnie play Dracula in a movie.
Hi, my name is Chris. Just thought i'd introduce myself because im'a be here awhile...
I can't even describe how emotionally invested in this short film I was. And how broken I feel now.
Shit gave me goosebumps 🤘
I see you; especially when your eyes are closed... 🐺
I think this is the 2nd comment I have ever left...I have chills. Like massive chills. I didn’t even know I could get chills on my head...amazing. Ronnie Radke has the best voice in music. Amazing.
ok I'm emo again
This was pretty dumb
I could see these people working at hot topic or Spencers during the weekend
Goth people r weird
HOLY FUCK. JUST CROWN THIS AS SONG OF THE YEAR ALREADY. GO STRAIGHT TO 2022.
It's not only a song.. It.s an experiance
Killed it. Outstanding
<3 Thank you!
This made me become so engulfed that I just watched it several times back to back. This was definitely amazing and very well done. Ronnie is and always will be badass
Please... please tell me you're working towards a full musical?
I have watched this an unhealthy amount of times and I have no intention of stopping anytime soon. This is a masterpiece.
Dude, holy hell. I felt like I was at a Broadway play and I don’t know why but this actually gave me chills lmfaoo
This is when you know that your career is over. Constantly rehashing your old hits because your new stuff is garbage.
Left me in chills first listen through
DAMN! It was cool seeing Paige and Ronnie in a music vid together
This is pure art and talent😍 R.I.P Derek
Speechless...
art
OMGG 😭😭😭🖤🖤🖤👏👏
IM JUST HERE FOR PAIGE 😅😩
As a wrestling fan and a falling in reverse fan, I love seeing Paige and Ronnie together! They have beautiful chemistry 🖤
God that was amazing video ever and wish it was a movie but still it amazing and made me cry and love how vampires should be in movies
Wow. Musical and visual masterpiece.
Ronnie without tattoos is a strange image my brain doesn't understand
ВАААААААААУ. Кроме эмоций я никак не могу выразить то, что сейчас чувствую. Эта группа будет навсегда в моём сердце. 💗
Finally some new Ronnie
Crying in the club rn
великолепно!!!!!
I did not bite her! I did noht.
This was beautiful. Somehow I knew they did this for derek. Still didn't hurt any less when I seen his name at the end.
krl é a Paige mano
Just amazing. Ronnie has done it again. I felt like I was watching a Gothic movie. Keep up the great work, Bro!
This is amazing, operatic metal, paige also did great
this isn't official video anymore, this is a movie
Damn Ronnie.... Love this. The emotion is pretty crazy.
Did they extend his forehead???
it's giving me total "vampires will never hurt you" vibes towards the end and i am LIVING
🛐🛐
One word. EPIC
The lyrics...are kinda corny..ngl.
lestat de lioncourt could never
This is such a LOVE omg
Actual goosebumps the entire time. I loved hearing the true potential and vocal range in this song. Your voice is super beautiful with amazing control.
😍❤️❤️❤️
Thank God "The Drug In Me Is You" was not a one time thing. These are truly amazing
I love this so much
Unbelievable! This is beautiful! It's art!🖤
not as good at the original
Goosebumps. Amazing.
Period Paige
What a masterpiece for goodness sake!
That mansion reminded me of the one from Stay Alive. Which just added so much to the aesthetic for me. Am I the only one?
Never heard of this guy before. He has an amazing voice.
Awesome! I'm ready for a movie or musical♠️♠️♠️
I‘m addicted to this masterpiece now.
We need an album of 'revamped' songs
Actress name please ?
He needs his own category at VMA'S Cinematic artful masterpiece music video award lol
YOOOOOOO THIS IS AMAZING
Cool video. Prefer the original song though obviously, it's a banger.
hehehehehe reVAMPed
Everything about this is beautiful done
This gave me chills both times I watched... Another amazing revamp, Ronnie.
Omg we didn’t know we needed this fml!!!
this had no business being this good
Ty Daddy, for raising Ronnie on Black Sabbath
Even though it's a little weird still amazing
Does this count as some sort of modern Bohemian Rhapsody?
Wtf. . . .
original of the best, this of изголение
Well I'm not a vampire But I feel like one Sometimes I sleep all day Because I hate the sunlight My hands are always shaking Body's always aching And the dark is when I feed Well I can lure any woman that I want to in my bed With me And whiskey seems to be my holy water Mothers better lock your doors And hide your daughters I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness sake Where is my self control? If home is where my heart is Then my heart has lost all hope Well I'm not a zombie But I feel like one today Self induced comatose, chemical daze My head is always spinning From this dizzy, blurry vision And my stomach has had enough I feel like a lady That is pregnant with a baby 'Cause I'm always throwing up Hi, My name is Ronnie I'm an addict (Hi, Ronnie!) Daddy should've never raised me on Black Sabbath! I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness sake Where is my self control? If home is where my heart is Then my heart has lost all hope God bless all of you now 'Cause I'm going straight to Hell And I'm taking you down with me 'Cause you know damn well I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness sake Where is my self control? If home is where my heart is Then my heart has lost all hope All hope All hope
you pulled it off. uncle 🖤🖤🖤 I come to listen to it today February 14, a good gift ☺️☺️
Thumbnail looks like Elon Musk lmao
Interview with the vampire
Amazing! Perfect lyrics and everything else!🖤
Ronnie never stops blowing me away ! His voice is so versatile, and he always have the most amazing ideas
I’m not a fan of Paige like at all, I personally think she’s annoying, but she did good here. Especially Ronnie. Wonderful song, wonderful video 👏
👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼
Not the best one they made but was OK
I think her in white is the ghost of her b4 suicide
I love that Paige is in this it’s fukkin cool beautiful couple and not to mention these remixes yur doing are very cool
We need to bring back punk rock music again! Today’s rap is horrible!
This is a masterpiece
Нихуясе как мощно
Wooow
Paige💥
Well, DAMN! This gives chills. Another well done job from Ronnie and everyone involved with this project. His vocals are just amazing.
This. Is. A. Masterpiece.
Oh my, this is just oh my gosh I in love
Is the chick Paige from wwe ?
Nope the drug was dope but this one no no no no
What a damn Fckn Masterpiece !!!!!
Honestly boys, can't believe my ears and eyes, so so great. It's a masterpiece ❤️
This is so beautiful it made me cry. Ronnie is so talented
Like that he's revisiting these songs. Sounds amazing. Wish he was matched with a girl that fit the theme though instead of a generic lip/boob jobbed Kardashian wannabe fake sex doll lookin monstrosity. It's the first time plastic surgery made it into Hungary hahaha.
When you risk a rez for your homie and you both get clapped.
Okay. Now I'm emo in a dramatic and fancy way.
Wow Love this! Reminds me how much I still like this music ❤️❤️❤️
new meatloaf
This shit is the best thing in a long time.
Wow, didn’t think it would get as good as the original. Videos never fail to impress 😆😆
Probably in the minority but these orchestral attempts or whatever the hell he’s been doing, sound so corny lmfao
please let these re-worked songs lead up to an Orchestrated live performance tour <3
OMG, his vocals are insane 🔥🔥🔥
Ronnie's singing has gotten so damn good
"Daddy should have never raised me on Black Sabbath."   Joke's on you, it was Mama who raised me on rock n' roll.
love it
Haha re'vamp'ed 🤣
OMFG Ronnie 😍🖤🖤🖤
Rest In Peace Derek Jones! You Will Be Forever Missed!
🔥
its been 2 hours of a movie in 6 min, thank u for the masterpiece
wow... he never fails to amaze me. i love this so much❤️can’t wait to see him again, when covid is over
The original was better
At this point we literally need a full on album
im disappointed i didnt know this released immediately when it released
The video took too much attention to itself.
:O
hoollly shiiiitt that was fucking insane!!! i literally fucking cried how intense his screams were
wait people still like vampires in 2021??. no hate
Epic version ⚘
Yung Ozzy
Just make a fucking movie already!! 💖💯
uau meus amigos UAU
Ronnie is a fucking genius....This is how these songs should have always sounded, but he was like you can hear this when I want you to hear it.
I'm about 99% that's Paige in the video so going off that.....   Are we just gonna past by the fact that she looks fucking stunning in this?
So when is the movie dropping then? Seriously well done!
Masterpiece.
Delight! Super!!!  ❤️❤️❤️
Haha I get it reVAMPed
The Oscar for the video
Я уж думал очередной дворец Путина.
Last year at this time we got, The drug in me is reimagined. 2021 we get this beautiful masterpiece. Featuring WWE's Paige.
So ummmm, this gave me the absolute chills.
Interview with Ronnie Radke.  Truly love song I think
Yes!!!!! Plz keep dropping more like this!!
Pretty. Fuckin. Epic.
I wonder if the rest of the band is okay with not being included in the video and not even taking credit for the music, since, according to the comments, everyhing is done by Ronnie. By the way, the song is great, very similar to what Ice Nine Kills has been doing for years.
Absolute worthy as a tribute towards Derek Jones may he rest peacefully
The Script A Mafia Story! Read The new Novel.. A Movie For Your Mind..
Interesting. Definitely prefer the original
THANK YOU 😭❤️❤️
WHAT THE FUCKING FUCK???  I'm speechless and my ears are blessed. 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Ronnie is so talented 👌🏻
😍😍😍😍
🖤🖤🖤🧛‍♂️💀🖤🖤🖤
I have no words 😮😍
Sabbath Bloody Sabbath
Ronnie and paige
It's amazing how Ronnie's voice has gotten better throughout the years!
Damn!!!!!! 10 times better than the original!!!
Guys i think he may b a vampire
this is a masterpiece
I foresee an entire reimagined album coming and id fucking love it
That was fucking intense
Thought this was Cody Ko
Can we talk about how BEAUTIFUL that girl is? JESUS! 😭😍
Every video outdoes the last ! Holy shit this was good
I love this. I can't wait for the film show. I'm glad to finally see Paige in ur vid after so long g 2gether. I see this as u showing true love . Great vid music amazing vocals.  Story line piano. Fuckinf talent 10000000%
GOD TIER SONG
Cool video but vamps are a dying breed
Wonderful! Great! Bravo! 👏👏👏
Holy shit
This is more of a soundtrack to a movie. Love it.
Damnnnnn 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Musical masterpiece 👏🏻
Your close, keep trying and soon you’ll have a good song
Better than any episode of the vampire diaries I’ve seen
Literaly felling shivers down my spine...
This is lacking the sense of humour that the original one had. Dont like it
Omg o.o
I really hope this proof he's doing this for a full album 🙏The Drug In Me Is You, now this 🔥 Escape The Fate hope you see what you lost 🤣
You have no right bein this good my guy
When he started yelling tho..💗
That first album was back in the piratebay days
PADU BROO.. #staysafe
When He's burning alive is when it hits the hardest.... R.I.P. DEREK JONES!!!!
Saraya could be called to participate in the angels of the night she would be beautiful as a vampire
Amazing music video. Beautiful.
Well I'm not a vampire But I feel like one Sometimes I sleep all day Because I hate the sunlight My hands are always shaking Body's always aching And the dark is when I feed  Well I can lure any woman that I want to in my bed With me And whiskey seems to be my holy water Mothers better lock your doors And hide your daughters  I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness sake Where is my self control? If home is where my heart is Then my heart has lost all hope  Well I'm not a zombie But I feel like one today Self induced comatose, chemical daze  My head is always spinning From this dizzy, blurry vision And my stomach has had enough I feel like a lady That is pregnant with a baby 'Cause I'm always throwing up  Hi, My name is Ronnie I'm an addict (Hi, Ronnie!) Daddy should've never raised me on Black Sabbath!  I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness sake Where is my self control? If home is where my heart is Then my heart has lost all hope  God bless all of you now 'Cause I'm going straight to Hell And I'm taking you down with me 'Cause you know damn well  I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold?  I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness sake Where is my self control? If home is where my heart is Then my heart has lost all hope All hope All hope
Ronnie, as an influential artist and a damn good artist, please make sure that if one of your videos has anything in it relating to self harm and any other possibly triggering actions or themes that you give a warning at the beginning of the video with an exact timestamp so that it can be prepared for/ avoided. Thank you and rock on!!!!! ☺☺☺
Ok ok I’m here.
Is this short movie ?
Fuck yeah!
RONNIE EU TE IDOLATRO
5:19 Isn't that the same way he stands at the beginning of popular monster?
Nice clip🎬🎬🎬🎬
Wow 🤩

Saugen im Mond Licht mucke

Epic!!!!
Loki

Holy shit! This is an absolute masterpiece!!!
Like before play the song . Good decision . Never disappoint
I want to see or watch this on live! This is a work of an art. 🤘
Amazing 🤤
That was special, Thank You Ronnie, Thank You Falling in Reverse.
Guess I’m in the minority here. Didn’t care for this redone version.🤷🏻‍♂️ But the video was amazing props to the editors!👌🏻
Absolutely LOVED this!
paige in the home!
somebody: "make the best vampire movie ever existed that is under 7 minutes long" ronnie: "ok"
i wasnt ready for this but im so happy its here-
I'm in awe. Masterpiece 💀🤘🦄❤️🖤💜
Another beautiful reworked song love it
OMFG...
Please release the new album. I’m sick of buying singles I’ll have to buy AGAIN once the album releases.
Where is he going with the new genre. Like it’s good just different
Really hope we get to see the RonnieRadke Cinematic Universe where Werewolf Ronnie and Vampire Ronnie team up against... Someone.
Beautiful
Damn, I love u Ronnie!
Ronnies out here looking like Professor Snape.
In loving memory of Derek Jones😭😭
"I'm Not A Vampire (Revamped)" - Спасибо, Ронни! Восхитительная работа!!! Космический голос + завораживающее видео,... unreal real... many thanks !!!
I feel like a vampire.. I forgot how to Breathe
WWE Paige really does indeed fit well in a role of a VAMPIRE. she had that natural  hot look of a Vampire xD. Wow Very Impressive.
I love how I hate how I love how good you are ^O^
I felt like as if I just watched an opera
what a fucking MASTERPIECE!!!!
How long did it take to hide all the tattoos from Ronnie's body. This is the second composition reworked in a new way.  And it just sounds amazing.  Ronnie has great talent.  With a capital letter.  Meeting this group has changed my world forever.  Thank you so much.  I will forever remain your faithful listener.
💓
Now this is what I call passion, always out there to make something different. This is Art. Ronnie never fails.
M A S T E R P I E C E
I want to see Ronnie hit A list
Interesting
https://youtu.be/W9dPGW_g6sQ New clips is comming...
I can feel this song in my bones
Girls wwe
So fucking amazing!!! Bravo
Paige is so damn gorgeous
I LOVE YOU PAIGE!!!😀
Well, that 6 minutes felt so short. Like the shortest 6 minutes ever. Guess that means I need more. MUCH more!  I follow Ronnie and his music for many, many years now and I always said, that he's a genius when it comes to music and an inspiration for me as well. Not doing what everyone else is doing. No.. Doing your on stuff, try something new, being creative and unique. This is what music is about. This is someone that I call a true artist. This is him.
Is it just me, or does that look identical to the same house that 'PALAYE ROYALE' shot the music video for 'Tonight is the night I die' which was also about Vampires 🤔🤔🤔
i just can't look at him with the hidden tattoos and see that it is Ronnie!
I stopped breathing at some point of the video O.O
Great song and saraya acting super cool. 😍
Amazing
Wow, such a great rearrangement of this 10 year old song! And the video with it is really fabulous!
How is this not at a billion views yet? Pretty sure all these views are me. Where errrbody at?
This is so great!!
Me and ma niggas listening to Falling in Reverse
Wow, this is amazing.
So this is what they mean with "be the best version of yourself ". That Song really made it.
i can't stop crying/
Fuking hell.. this is a movie dude.
Am I the only one that got goosebumps from this?
Young Lady Dimitrescu)
thank you ronnie
Nu pizdec epichno Ronnie 10letie otmetil
I love seeing an artist reinvent himselfm
Give this man his roses now!  Absolute masterpiece!  If this song and/or video doesn't receive some type of honors then music is dead.  Seriously you belong on Broadway.
Geweldig
Jesus is coming soon. Wake Up. Get right with God..
Awesome song, the harmony and the style of this revamped version is a masterpiece! You need talent, effort and dedication for this  Better than all of the pop song in the billboard, you just need an EDM and autotune
No matter what, in terms of even whole genres, I reckon the vocal ability of this performance is a fucking force to be reckoned with. I don't even listen to FIR that much at all, but this shit's legendary. All the kudos. Bravissimo.
Ronnie doesn't do videos. This is a movie.
Oh my god my baby (paige) is looking gorgeous I'm so amazed right now my head is spinning tbh I love her so damn much
Un fottuto capolavoro. Ronnie è il migliore ed è anni avanti.
Cringe
Paige's acting is amazing
um 4k???? @Epitaph Records
wow
Im in love with you guys, just know that.
yo this dope
I got literal fucking chills and tears   That was beautiful
i don't know why, but this masterpiece make me feel that a strong couple... GOAL
I fucking love it❤️🔥
This cant be real..im obsessed 🔥
Epic Valentine Days Gift 🙏🌹 🐨
This is a masterpiece <3
Paigeee ♥️
Wow
Perfect Grammy winning
I was holding my breath for 6 minutes listening to this.
Love it! 🖤Please do more.
I CAN'T STOP WATCHING THIS ❤️🖤❤️🖤❤️🖤❤️
.
Whoa, it gives me the chills
Extremely Epic sounding, sound like it could be Film Trailer music!
Ronnie u kinda look like prof snape now
Beautiful.
I'm sorry but this was not better than the original
CADE OS BR PRA REPRESENTAR AQUI
Какой же кайф
If Severus Snape had made a career in music instead of wasting himself learning potions
A tour de force. This was absolutely fucking incredible!
Good to see Paige on a music video.
No words, just liked and felt it in my heart and soul. ❤
♥️
Damm, i love it
Bravo...Bravo...Ronnie...
From a werewolf to a vampire, not sure how this works. But seriously I am amazed how good this video is, it honestly looks better than some movies.
Now you can see hight hrothgar and graybearded calling the dragonborn
I would love for some more reimagined songs to drop tbh, this was amazing!
Pretty sure vampires aren't supposed to age, but Ronnie's started aging in reverse
Here for "Paige" she looks great
2:39
Oh. My. God. It’s amazing!
I'm not a vampire he said
Beautiful.
I'm in love
I love this dude, Ronnies voice is better than ever
4:27.😘🥰🥰🥰🥰❤
🤣🤣😂
Am I the only one that likes the originals but absolutely hates these? They make my skin crawl because they’re so uninspired. They don’t hold any of the weight the songs did when they came out and singing them in a different style just doesn’t work.
Wow what a fucking magnificent incredible masterpiece so beautiful
ok how about reimagine and revamp ALL OF THE ALBUMS 😊
👏👏👏👏👏🖤
Damn. Perfection.
This revamping (lol) is amazing but I can't help and be a bit sad that this is probably one of the first songs without Derek. Its bittersweet.
Age of the vampires...
“MOTHERF*CKER! IM A VAMPIRE!” That was jokes haha I feel you on that Ronnie.
Am I the only one who thinks Ronnie looks like Cher in this 🤣🤣
Это шедевр! 👍👍👍
Here you can see how much Willow looks like Ronnie 😍
This is truly amazing what
Hilarious.
You may not be a vampire but you are  amazing 👍👌
A beautiful rendition, cant wait to see Ronnie singing this (hopefully?) at the live event.
I HAD A MF DREAM ABOUT THIS MV I SAW IT IN MY DREAM AND IT REALLY EXISTS? OMFG WHAT
F them if they don’t give you a grammy, dude YOU ARE the Grammy! 💙
Meraviglioso
OMG
Got dang Ronnie, you absolutely killed it!!!! Such an amazing artist
literally incredible
Another masterpiece from Ronnie! Is this a clip or a short movie?
Lyrical genius
Ronnie, if you reading this comments just know that we all love you. And we remember Derek. Thanks to all the people who created that masterpiece.
I am in actual tears
Holy shit I got goosebumps,  this is amazing
i’m freaking obsessed with this
Talk about a fucking eargasm
Dude that's so powerful
Let's all remember Derek Jones! 🤘🤘🤘
My god that was amazing
I really like this new Falling In Reverse ;)
There's more plastic on this girl than on my credit card.
Wow!
Ok, so I'm I the only one who would love to see ronnie playing Sweeny Todd in a play? 😅😂
О ну нарешті в кліпі зняв Пейдж)) Супер відео)
Holy shit! I'm loving the new revamped version of past songs <3 Please do more <3
Imagine if this was used as a resident evil soundtrack 🤔
Ronnie is by far the most talented dude ive ever seen
WHAT THIS WAS SO EPIC
woah.
Only people who didn’t come from tiktok are worthy of liking this comment
That was... interesting
This was fantastic! The exaggerated and glorified self-display of what the struggles of being a vampire can be like, together with the vocal and philharmonic performance, was PERFECT. The CGI was so-so, but with the satirical delivery, it worked like a charm. And also, 'Re-Vamped'? I see what you did there😉 10/10 👌
🖤☠🖤☠🖤
I deleted that because it was unfair of me to say in a public forum. Maybe one day we can have a drink about it, i miss the you before all of this.
Ehh... No guitars, no drumming, no bass... That's like RR's solo project at this point. And it fucking SUCK!
I'm having a heart attack ..
Oh sh*t
This guy always surprise me. He has a unique way to tell stories trough the music. I love the way he makes music. Good job, Ronnie.
WOW.just wow....🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
Woah...
This is the single best remake I've think I've ever heard in my life._. I love this song so much this is gonna be loop for months in my spotify!I'll say it once and say it AGAIN! Ronnie is the king and master of all genres hes done like almost every type of music I can think of and it works so well but this time has outdone himself people praise this man because we got a king!*Bows down*I'm not worthy!
WOW....i mean....this was....JUST WOW O_O
Holy shhhhh, THIS IS ART.
Nice to see Tommy Wiseau found a new hobby
What the fuck... Makes me feel grateful for being alive.
The emo kid in my soul just came out
Masterpiece... this song give me the chills..  always love ronnie waayyy back when he's still in escape the fate...
Big, gorgeous, fucking majestic! Ronnie done done it a fucking again. Magical darkness💖💖💖
😂
👏 👏 👏
what a FK&&(# masterpiece.... worth the wait !
You guys need to do s song with @ jeris johnson let's get done 💘
Am I a fan of him changing this song? No not at all BUT I love what he did with it. I love this video and the way it's presented, this video low key gives me 'dark shadows' vibes . No negativity here!!!! Just because I'm not a big fan doesn't mean I hate it, I love the way that the band is changing things around with their music. I'll always be a fan
Wow. This is epic.
DUDE THIS IS SICK
woahhh this ver is so nice
The universe is trying to make my emo phase come back and idk how to feel about that
Bruhhh I met you in 2008 and have been a fan since. I love these revamped songs.
tonight is the night mansion
This songs blowing up on TikTok already smh
Could of found someone better then Paige
We are going to wait for having a vocal cover of this masterpiece !!
Loki?
Ending was crazy but awesome video 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Me encanta el vídeo ,fenomenal !!!
That's art.
ВСЕ ахуенно но я ждал гитары взрыв как в прошлом клипе эххх надеюсь будет версия с гитарами когда нибудь
This just made my fucking day. Beautiful bro 👆
GREAT ,BUT ....guitars ,need hardrock
Vampire daddy vibes 👀
wholy crap! that was insane.!
:]
Beutiful song rock
King.
Holy cow! Ronnie just went from vampire to Dracula lol
Goddamn. Amazing. 👏👏👏
great ronnie
anyone weirded out by non tattooed donnie?
Hermoso video
Oh wow, he's wearing a shirt.
revamped as in VAMPire! Well played
Epic? yes. Did it grab me like drug is reimagined? No. Will I give it another chance? Yes
I’m here because of Paige 😂
where are all his tattoes ?
Yeaaaahh
slk mo perfeito
YASSS
This is fucking art
this might be the greatest thing ever... yah no it definitely is
This is what happens when your music grows up but still keeps the same energy. I feel like this is how it was supposed to be written all along, I would’ve never thought of the original song as a “rough draft” before in my life, but this is polished.
Epic!!!
I'm a vampire
In my opinion.... I like all of his dark music way more than some of his previous stuff... it’s just better. I think he has a real talent for it. IMO he should stick to that area because of how good he is at it but this is also my opinion. I could just like dark stuff and I’m being biased but I swear it’s just so much better! Lol
The production value of this video is incredible.... Hats off to you!
Rest In Peace Derek✨
Hes really grown up🥺
It's fuckin amazing the way to convey so many emotion and feelings through his vocals in just 6 min, I'd do anything to just hear this masterpiece for just a moment
wow
Brooooo....I didn't know that I needed this version in my life, now I can die in peace.  Not only did it transform it, it also maintained its essence and originality.  I think Ronnie has always given us quality music and he keeps renewing himself.  After 10 years we have all changed, this shows a bit of the life we ​​have led, how we have matured.  Now everything has a new meaning 🙌🏼🖤 My heart has lost.....
I love these new renditions. Shows off Ronnie's vocal and creative range- which personally, I didnt know he had.
this is an absolutely MASTERPIECE!
ooooh no the autotune :'(
Wow, they never fail to amaze me!! Fantastic!!💞
I absolutely love this look for him!  The music is beautiful!  We need a whole storyline slash production of this ! Please!
These revamped videos are so fucking beautiful genuinely breath taking
Amazing
No one told me aro from twilight sang. What a nice suprise
💗💗💗💗💗
Holy crab this is a f*ckng movie , great job
Adore these please produce more!!!! Wonderful job and kicking ass as always for  whatever you decide to sing Ronnie. Enjoyed Paige being included as well. 👏
This song and production are not from this world MY GOD this can't be real! The power you bring I'm speechless! Thank you for creating this masterpiece!
I LOVE THIS 🥲
What a banger. Falling in Reverse is making such an awesome work these last years
What kind of masterpiece is this? Bro people are sleeping on Ronnie and Falling in Reverse, this song is so goood wtf!!!!I mean the first 12 second are better than a movie.
Literally in tears rn... No words...🙏🤗🔥🤘🤟✌
I really love these kinds of songs they been making lately
Damn I didnt think I'd like this song in a different flavor. 🔥🔥🔥
Came to watch Paige, and probably found my favourite singer!
You brought aspects from things we loved but we don't love this song
😂
This is great for sure, not feeling it as much as I did The Drug In Me Is You, but still amazing.
Raised by the wolves when?
That was amazing
DAAAAMMMMNNN!!! <3
beautiful
That had to be the sickest fucking screams I’ve ever heard if that was all you
Thank you for this.
Bruhhhhh this is best I've seen
Бля это просто нереально шедеврально. С первых строк вокал ронни пррсто завораживает. А клип это просто нет слов. Сказать шедевр- значит ничего не сказать!
Sem palavras 🖤
That ending holy shit
I’m pretty sure I’ve watched this like 150 times times since it came out.  I lose time when FiR releases new music.  And I’m completely fine with that.  It’s just incredible 🖤
#LLDJ🕊️
So is Ronnie just gonna turn all his classics into Ballads..... Cause if he is I'm here for it.
What Revolution is Ronnie trying to bring up here
Can somebody please write some spicy fanfiction already
Keep it up brother you are incredible
До мурашек!
Best music video this year!!! Not so far, not for now, THIS IS IT! HANDS DOWN
AaaaaAaaaaaAaaaaAaa
Absolutely Amazazazing. Rest in peace Derek
Alright but am i the only one who sees Aro like the one from the vultury?
When Loki fakes his death in the mcu to make music.
Un genio, pasan los años y se sigue superando...
Still can’t get over how good “Hi my name is Ronnie. I’m an addict” sounds. Just brilliant
IM IN LOVEEEE
❤
The mix in YouTube music and streams seem to be much more louder and consistent than in the video. Just pointing out as a loyal fan
What movies are coming out in 2021?  Ohh who cares we are just gonna watch this video over and over for couple months! 🇺🇸🤣🤘🤣🇺🇸
I'm embarrassed for you. This is a steaming pile. Stop doing this to great songs. Call Jacky and get back to making good music.
Amado, que clipe puta merda até de vampiro vc fica bonito
a masterpiece
These guys literally make movies
Love it love it!!!
Love to see Paige making debut in music world
This was amazing! Better than the original and I've been a fan since the beginning!
I love you!
Can someone help me understand the story of the video?  Paige wakes up in the future as a vampire and remembers her memories of her lover (Ronnie) who was a vampire that was killed by the townspeople and in turn kills herself out of sadness?
I fuckinggggg love this omg
Finally my desire for new falling in reverse has been satisfied
Need to watch this on a bigger screen when I get the chance! Good job guys!
Love the original, but this is something else, damn!
3:25 Sounds like boss fight in God of War 2
I can't help but take it as a pun.. ReVAMPED
HOLY SHIT YES THIS IS FUCKING AMAZING
Holy crap, this literally gave me chills! I love it!!!!
I came here because of wrestlelamia.......  this is shite.
Comentarios en español... Para describir las emociones que nos provocan y hace sentir esta sublime canción! ❣️🖤
my eyeliner is ruined from crying.
I love this so much, the video complements the revamp so well. Music wise im blown away, when the choir starts my jaw dropped. FIR do it again <3
I swear if this song is not the theme or at least in the Morbius soundtrack, Its gonna be a missed opportunity 🔥👀🧛🏻
Shit ! She's realy a vampire ...
I was waiting this shit for so long, next will be raised by wolves (raiseded)
Holy fucking shit! This was epic!
I'm  listening to this at 12am And um I LOVE THIS version tool!! And the video😆
just wow
Welp, just bought this song on Itunes. Straight into my playlist with you!
Goosebumps Ronnie Goddamn
😀I just started standup and want ur OPINION. AM I FUNNY? Take my LAUGH CHALLENGE!!😆 (Click on the Marshmellow Man and watch the Time Traveler)
Ronny is such a fuckin wallet of creativity. what a monster
This left me so speechless omfg .
I pray anyone that sees this find his/her master peace”
Actually kinda reminds me of Johny Depp in a way lol
Keep this up Ronnie
Holy shit. That hit me so fucking hard.
😍😍😍😍😍😍
I am in awe! It was a wonderful master piece 💜.
This is art.
Wow, i just can say wow
Wow..
Fuck this is great. Holy shit.
fairly outstanding.
Amazing 😍😍
They should do goodbye graceful
What's the tuning of the piano?
Vita Nova
For goodness sake, keep going revamped and reimagined stuff ronnie
If you like this vid, check out Screams of Syrens last video, Mr. Nobody.
I know this an older song...but I love this new side of him.
🥲 ronnie taming his craziest and best songs is everything. i absolutely love this ❤️
Back again...F*CK I can't get enough of this musical genius!! It's amazing! Goosebumps every time!
3:45 - 4:23 Sounds so good, so ridiculously talented!
This not being in 4k is a crime
I loved The Drug in Me is Reimagined but this one was a miss for me. Just felt like a bunch of vocal runs and weird timing (hello second verse) thrown in without any real thought.
That was frickin' awesome!!!
when you order interview with the vampire off of wish
So she's still alive right? It was the girl in the white dress (the ghost?) that burned up?
How r u not trending number 1 instead of this W.A.P bullshit
HOLY FUCKING FUCK ...chills ...chills galore   fucking masterpiece ronnie is on a whole different level godly
Just not into it
ARREPIEI! É só o que tenho a deixar registrado
No One: Nobody: me: hey look its Paige
Loving this style of music!
Wow
HOLY SHIT YES
Oh my fucking.. Wtf? Ronnie man! My main man! This is awsome! Mindblowing! U are my best singer! 🤘🖤
FC from thailand
Between this Revamp and Taylor’s Love Story should I just go ahead and get side bangs again? Maybe a dress with bootcut jeans underneath?
OMG ronnie+Makeup= art
This is FUCKING AWESOME!
It's so crazy how Ronnie has managed to stay relevant in the music scene for over a decade now by staying true to himself and releasing fresh good music consistently. Legendary rockstar status acheived id say.
it’s so good. Tears.
This was fucking great.
woah. just woah. im speechless.
I think the best song from that album to do next in this style to would be Sink Or Swim.
ayo? this is amazing high key
From classic rock to classic mozart
Ronnie Radke is a vampire, literally looks the same
Amazing! I love all these remakes he has been doing.
So refreshing to find something that is not rap/hip hop/reggaeton on trending
I'm here because of Paige
goddamn ronnie and team, such a nice music rework!!!!
When Emo evolves into full on theatrical Goth... "It's not a phase mom!"
THIS IS LEGITNESS!!!!   \m/,
ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!! 🖤🩸🎶♥️🎶🩸🖤 Loved the original too!!!
Absolutely amazing
LOVE YOU PAIGE, LOVE YOU SARAYA JADE BEVIS🖤🥰😍😘💞
I hope they do self destruct personality next
Ho. Ly. Shit. 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍

I only came here because of Paige. Not disappointed.
Its look like Resident Evil 8
This was sooo good
Love it....
I just came to see paige
I love how he really went ALL IN with this one. Really only mad props for Ronnie !!!
Holy fuckin shit ronnie I love this
Damn. The video is epic!
I swear I've never pressed the repeat button so fast in my life!!!!
Ronnie Radke is the only guy who can make me fall in love with ballad song with a taste of orchestra!
Oh damn that is Paige..
Did he get his face tattoos removed?
Wow
Ronnie Radke had so much potential in Escape The Fate this is such a sad shame
Jacky did it better...sorry
How corny fake ass vampires
Paige looks stunning 😍
Go paige from wwe
鬼滅の刃の鬼を彷彿させる。 素敵な作品です。 やっぱり王子キャラが似合う💯❤️ これからもずっと大好き❤️
This is just so very emotional and beautiful. In every way.
Fun fact: the woman in the video is WWE's Paige, his gf.
You brought shivers with this. 💯
The emotion😞😔I felt it
This is amazing.
GOOOOOOOD
Fucking amazing!
Okay, since when did Paige start looking like a whole different person?
Oh hi Ronnie, I did not know it was you
WHERE IS THE LOVE BUTTON?!
I honestly don’t have words to describe how I feel right now. Genius only comes to mind.
The video is stunning
So      Full re-imagined album when?? Please?
Waiting for Popular Monster reimagined.
0:32 its Paige
Need a “Champion” (undisputed) next.
This is a mixed bag for me. I love the gothic theme but it just doesn’t hit like the drug reimagined.
Imagine covering your OWN songs just to make them even more of a masterpiece than the original. Well done, Ronnie.
How does he get younger every year??
Paige is beautiful as ever he is a lucky man
Wrestling fans came to see Paige be in her element along with the epic music
Is this going to be considered CLASSICAL MUSIC in 500 years 😀
I feel like there's underlying Monster movies theme to their music here.  - Popular Monster                         = Werewolf - The Drug in me is Reimagined = Vampire - I'm not a Vampire (Revamped) = Vampire  This song is this trilogy's conclusion as he is dead.  Falling in Reverse Monster Verse Trilogy
And Whiskey seems to be my holy water♥️
Really loving the music scene of 2021 so far ronnie once again knocks it out of the park in exceeding my expectations this was fucking beautiful
paige<3
I didn’t recognize Paige with curly hair

Ronnie is talented in way to many ways definitely underestimated
Paige looks like the Perfect VAMPIRE Victim!!!
Petitioning for this to be adapted into a movie starring Ronnie.
ONE WORD BRILLIANT
Lil Huddy watching this like 😐👀
Yo sólo vine aquí x paige 😎
I can't express my utter enjoyment in how much I love Ronnie he's Honesty an S tier vocalist and more importantly I can add actor because holy hell this was an experience. And I love the direction FIR is going. R.i.p  Derek
Paige here
Pitch correction was left a little noticeable. Still amazing.
Oh hi there emo. been a while
Would’ve been better if you were original with the video. I bet Palaye Royale isn’t happy with it
😱😱😱amaaaaaaazinggg
I HATE that I’m still fangirl ing over this it’s just in my blood I can’t help it
Hello 13 year old me
WOOE  IG GAHSGSHSGSUDHSISHS
Wow that was terrible.
Am I the only one who thinks this should be turned into a movie? Also, please do more songs like this!
When 4:10 hit. Omg 🤯
I don’t get why everyone jerked this song off... The original was good but this to me is just a theatrical mainstream rendition of what was a solid heavy rock song.
Ronnie, you’ve done it again!!!
I came here for Paige...  End up loving the song after.
This band gets better and better. This is absolute art! The remixes are straight 🔥🔥🔥.
Oh my fucking god Ronnie I just adore you.... so fucking talented
Holy shittttttt eargasm
I want a full revamped album!
Ronnie just put out a god damn musical already
JFC, I loved the original, but this is on a WHOLE NEW FUCKING LEVEL!
This was the best thing I have ever seen in my entire life
The dislikes are the angry mob
wow, Ronnie flexin hard on this one. This man is one of the best to ever do it. Period. Fight me.
God damn your shit just gets better and better.
probably one of the best songs of all time (this version)
Damn
Listening to this right now while having flashbacks of my ex and how I became very cold to guys
At this point he’s just showing off but I love it
The end gives me cradle of filth vibes
the PRODUCTION *chef's kiss  but damn only criticism is that I wish the high scream at the end was the ending note. Should've made the climax the ending on this one.
0:31 paige
Who else is here just for Paige ??
We need more dramatic remakes of songs. It allows you to truly listen and understand the lyrics
Why does this sound like it could be a live performance at the Grammy’s...?
Falling in Reverse is my favorite band period. ❤
That was fucking intense
Bruh this is my favorite song and to see it come back makes me scream like a girl
I'm blown away by The Vampire Lestat's new video.
I REALLY LOVE THIS RECREATIONS OF OLD SONGS. THEY ARE JUST SO BEAUTIFUL AND SOOOO GOOD. MASTERPIECE!!!
why does ronnie looks aro and jasper from twilight
Woah the Trailer was AMAZING! So Ronnie whens the movie coming out? XD
This video is just incredible 😍. And don't get me started on Radkes voice just ascended to another level.
Gosh, that was powerful.
My mind: wow!
YO THESE THROWBACK REVAMPS ARE SENDING ME <3
This is literally food for my fucking soul, holy shit. ✨🖤⚰️✨
Well if Paige can't wrestle no more then she may as well try to break our into music and acting.     Worked for Rock and Cena so why not?
very much Queen Of The Damned 🖤🖤🖤🖤😍
We miss you Derek 😇 🙏🏻
This is pure Art
Meatloaf... is that you?
this was absolute shit never do this again
God damn what a ride.  The Falling in Reverse have the best music videos I've seen.
What a great song and video! A masterpiece!
Interview with a Vampire vibes.

Get major The Volturi-vibes from Ronnie. They only have to cast two of them if they do remakes in the future. No, but serioisly it’s awesome.
Expect the unexpected!!! Ronnie makes better music with every song!!!
this sounds me like starset
These versions are beautiful man, love his voice
I think Ronnie has found a new career!!!!
Ronnie......Awesome..... Paige......Gorgeous❤
It’s crazy seeing him with no tattoos.
LITERALLY SO MANY CHILLS. HOW DO YOU SING SO FUCKING BEAUTIFULLY
Wow! This is unfortunate, because if this was 2006/7, then this would have been a massive hit!
Blowing kisses to the viewers of the blow of affliction   there’s a diction  within infliction see you see me with all my dignity   seeing what I’m doing everything inside brewing   I blow my kisses to you  not a whole lot you can do  when I try to love you  when I try to love you  when I try love you when I try love you   and you try to love you You try to love you You try to love you  Blowing kisses to me too But when you try to love me Not afraid of me I let the beast free can’t see you see virginity  I’m afraid to be anything but me  Mercy the destiny to set the blow of affliction free   You’re seeing what I’m doing everything inside me brewing  See me how you want to see me   from nothing you’ve done to me I’ll be dissonant   Blowing kisses to the viewers of the blow of affliction
Ronnie Radke is a proper genius! This was bloody breathtakingly beautiful! WOW!
The best I've seen in a long time!! Incredibly beautiful ♡
Absolutely sublime beautiful melody
But will the whole album be redone this way because I’m FUCKING here for it 😍😍😍😍
wow
This song is making 2021 a god start of a year
So in love!!! <3
Derek forever ❤️
Great voice, these "re" versions of his songs are damned amazing
Turning another classic banger into a modern banger, just WOW indeed!
Nothing but chills
My Favorite Part is the R.I.P. Derek

Very Emo.  Pls Content Warn for self harm...that is quite irresponsible not to.
EPIC
......... omfg ................. i'm confused i'm just listening again ok? and again and again and again ...
Paige looks so damn good in this video
This is EPIC
HOLY SHITTTTT
God damn that was refreshing.
Another masterpiece
Twilight Vampires could never. Sorry Edward
another amazing emotional rollercoaster of music from mr radke
The new twilight movie looks amazing
It’s like a George Michael’s video and an AFI video had a baby and then it was directed by Christopher Nolan 😭😭😭
Countdown to the next song 🎵 I cannot wait 🙌 both revised songs have been beyond perfection so far.
The best vampire movie
YEEEESSS!! FALLING IN REVERSE IS TRENDING ON YOUTUBE!!!
wonderful feeling of ecstasy 🤩❤️
Epic
I’m literally obsessed . Can you just revamp the entire album omg🖤
The artist formally known as Lestat.
First paige look really good on the white dress an damn ronnie this make me glad to be a fan of falling in reverse
Omg!! His voice is perfect
Loving the hair
Another flawless reimagined song 🖤
I love what you are doing with these. Please keep doing it
Excelente
Amazing ❤️  It is not the same house where Palaye Royale filmed 'Tonight Is The Night I Die? 🤔
TE AMO SOS UN LOCO
The best part 3:18 LOL
Ronnie: I'm a VAMPIRE Me who hasn't gone outside in 6 months: Pff, get a load of this guy
From THE DRUG IN ME IS REIMAGINED to I'M NOT A VAMPIRE REVAMPED. Dude whats next????
Just incredible
Dude holy shit i fucking love Ronnie
ok. as good as the drug is me in you. didn't expect that much. what about an album in this style?
Damn Ronnie. This kicks ass!
I'm not digging it. But I respect it.
I...I don’t quite know what to say...there are no words that can describe how amazing this song is....and the video...I want this as a movie!
Flawless Victory........
Sooo, I am a relatively new fan of Falling In Reverse, three years and counting, and that was actually coincidentally.     I was listening to Deuce's song ft. Ronnie, and at the moment I heard Ronnie's voice, something clicked, and I started searching for his tracks, and so on. And from then on, oh boy... It's been a downhill road to the rabbit hole called Ronnie Radke and Falling In Reverse—a f*cking pleasant one, of course!     Truth be told, I didn't dig the original "I'm Not A Vampire".     Now, however, this version is what I'd call a masterpiece!!!
Whoa 😮
Is this actually his wife? 🤔
Game of Thrones, but less Games and more Twilight
Bruh add some high hats and 808’s in this bitch n it’d b vibin
Non c'è la faccio, troppi ricordi  Cit
I really like it & I really like vampires
Great "ReVampire". Would love to see the making of this vid
Holy shit.
FUCKING DOPE
PAIGE LOOKS AMAZING! Good song too!
No mask..
Anyone wondering where the tall vampire lady from resident evil is?
Still a better love story than Twilight
"In loving memory of Derek Jones" 😭 It hurts 😭
Paige here!
Beautifully orchestrated, I felt this deep. Can't get enough.
Holy fuck...
Just wow
That gave me chills.
holy shit paige huh okay
This could be music for a movie- or even a trailer for it- but I SWEAR it needs to be out there more 👀
I am literally in tears. Rip Derek.
Yaasssss
Love it, this is everything.
How does this not have 10 million views yet?  Should be #1 on trending.
All I can say is WOW!!!
GOOSEBUMPS.....
i just want to know what foundation is being used
🖤🖤🖤
pls we want an revamped album :(
What is this genre?🤔😂
Ronnie looks gorgeous omgggg
Words can’t even describe the emotion I feel
Невероятно! До мурашек.
After Popular Monster and The Drug in Me, i thought that was it. It could not get better than this. No way, no how, is he gonna one up these songs!  I am so happy that i was wrong. Thank you Ronnie, and FiR!
Holy shit, that's epic
This video literally gives me chills side note that echo on “well” really sounding like Britney bitch
I noticed a theme the redone songs start with a piano and are dark they go on getting more energetic and end with light (fire or the sun which is also technically fire)
Didn't listen the end; I was just clapping.
Totally speechless!
This is amazing
And just like that. 2021 got better
Ronnie looks so odd with No Tattoos.
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvc01QVLu1OjS6_EYdAk1DA/videos?sub_confirmation=1&gb=1
why do i find this so funny
Man I love this band and a lot of their newer stuff but this one was just not for me.
Not loving it as much as the drug in me is you but glad to see Ronnie really embracing himself
Any vampire movie - were the real deal vampires.           falling in reverse - hold my fangs bitch.
Holy shit this is amazing
0:01-6:17 was the best part!!
Paige ❣️❣️
this is a masterpiece
Can we all appreciate the pun in the title? I'm not a vampire "revamped" 🤣🤣🤣🤣
This isn’t even a song it’s a whole overture. Amazing.
i just made nightcore! please check it out if you like this band and nightcore <3
honestly speechless! beautiful! can we please get more of these???!!! Theyre amazing
Superb baseline😳
Лайк, если тоже искал русский комент подтверждающий годноту этой песни)
Rip Derek The crack Ronny Eres el mejor Take care
Paige is in this
it's like watching a movie ♥ i LOVE it
Wow! Words do not describe how amazing this revamp is. It has given this song a completely different feeling.
Damn.. 423K in a day! There’s a reason for that! You and your music is Fucking awesome! Always have been.. and this music video is so Dope! 🤘🏻
This was simultaneously the coolest and the stupidest thing I've seen this month, somehow. That's Ronnie, I guess...
Fuckinggg love it
I love these revamps. Ronnie is so talented!
Love it can totally relate
I cant be the only one who was hoping Ronnie was going to go ape shit on the angry mob and have some insane bloodbath to protect them both
That’s fuckin’ gnarly.
This was a beautiful masterpiece ❤️ RIP Derek 😭
This is a fucking masterpiece
Wow! What a great fucking remake of a song! The video tho was fire!! Love it!
This alucard is different!
it's AMAZING!!! thank you so much
Bruh.... another banger! Downloaded instantly what a tune 🔥💯
Well...that was interesting.
(that vine) i can't believe you've done this  if he redoes the whole album i-
I like the song as a whole, but that second verse 😬 yikes
Holy shit paige is in this masterpiece awesome
hope the do a 'Revamped' version of the drug in me is you album.
Truly beautiful , this is a masterpiece
so good man!
My first Girlfriend had a Crush on Ronnie. These days I have
love the original, love the revamp. i have chills down to my bones!
this is the best I've heard and seen
I love this
Repent of your sins and turn to God, for the kingdom of Heaven is near. Matthew 3:2. Jesus loves you : ) Never give up on your life!!
Holy shit!!! screams black metal?? OMG so beatifull
OH MY GOD I'M SO BLOWN AWAY
I just found this, I had only known about the original song until today, the remake gives off a different vibe and it made my hair stand on end! It’s empowering!!!
Feels as if this took place in Blade’s universe
Eargasm at it's finest
I was under the impression that "The Drug in Me is Reimagined" wouldn't/couldn't be outdone... I'm... at a loss for words with this one.  Please, please, please make more of these! ❤️🔥
Is nobody talking about how good looking Ronnie looks without face tats?! He still looks good with them and I love them but like he’s gorgeous without ❤️🖤
A Cinematic Masterpiece
This is actually pretty sick! Best thing I’ve heard from him in a few years
Another legendary remaster, the talent is endless!
Ronnie making them trailer park bops I see.
OMGGG I JUST REALIZED HE LOOKS SO DIFFERENT BECAUSE HE HAS NO TATTOOS IN THIS VIDEO!!! AHHHHH
Fucking perfect
Holy shit! This is so beautifully and tragically well done. I'm loving this.  Happy valentine's to all the vampires out there!
Girl this is a whole ass movie
You know what would be interesting 🧐, ft Doja Cat ?
This is so good!!!
This is a fucking masterpiece!! Holy shit😲😲
he's  37 she is 28 and looks older
I love how Ronnie has the uncanny ability to turn any previous song of his into an entirely different genre
FUCK this was beautiful
Increíble 😭😭😭😭❤️😍
this is so epic i love it so much
The tribute at the end got me
Hey  Thats Paige from the WWE
Somebody watched dracula untold
ronnie out here channeling his inner tiny tim
I'm raging his hair is better than mine
Am I the only one who hates the revamps? RONNIE, BABY, STICK TO ROCK
The https://youtu.be/JqLIndMA9Ks origin of evil.
😍
We need a I'm not a Cat
NO RONNIE, IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE ROCK
"I'm Not A Vampire" Doesn't look like he's aged a day.
I liked this a lot... I really wish he would make some death core.. because this could have gone so sick with some blast beats and guttarals. It reminds me of some blackened deathcore a little... Still tho sick af. He doesn't dissapoint
HOLY FUCKING SHIT, THIS IS AWESOME
this is a masterpiece
Giving me Johnny Depp vibes, so good, Ronnie Radke is meant for screens🖤🖤
Paige \m/
#spiffcoin
Great ballad.....just as good as reimagined in a different way.....both climaxed at the end but that's expected with a ballad.....now rewrite what a ballad is Ronnie
Absolutely amazing ❤️
Paige was so good in this.
It’s a legit movie in 6 minutes — that’s damn impressive
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos⭕️
This song is motherfacking good
Como es que está joyita no tiene 1 millón de vistas?
Ok i have to say it but when ronnie lean piano
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace..  Except gifts can either be accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.
Ronnie is so damn talented dude damn 🤯
Ronnie always amazes me. He is so insanely talented.. Like wow.. This is juat amazing... Please do more🖤🖤🖤🖤. So happy he had her in this video. Love them together. 🤘🏻🤘🏻
I LOVE THISSS <333
Masterpiece.
This is unbelievable 😲  The video company: how much money do you want to spend on this musicvideo?  ronnie: yes
I've seen this like 1000+ times already. Ronnie is definetly the king of the music scene.
😭😭😭
the way they re-did the guitar solo was *chefs kiss*
Ronnie is a vampire, a werewolf, dad, streamer... and an addict.
Paige and Ronnie are so perfect
WOW AMAZING!
OMFG 🔥🔥🔥
Paige did well
🖤 PAIGE 🖤
Came for Paige, stayed for falling in reverse!
I've seen the actress somewhere?
jajaja i wanna see this in Teatro
I m not the only one here for PAIGE!!😍
Ronnie is a genius  FIR 👹🤘   I like the gothic style
Omg quedé loca con la calidad de este vídeo, dios. Parece una película wooo
Goosebumps!!! Absolutely stellar!! 💓
full album of reimagined songs would be awesome
This sucked.
That ladies and gentlemen, is a Masterpiece.
damn this was intense holy cow, beyond amazed.
I’m here for your evolution Ronnie. It’s dope and majestic. I literally still listen to this song all the time.   But the new stuff you’re doing, you’re becoming a legend bro
That shit was fucking insane
Everytime ronnie does this i feel like the kid who just discovered ronnie... Its beautiful. Thank you for the walks down memory lane and for the Interview with a vampire vibes
HOLY SHIT
Ronnie is so fucking talented. His vocals are incredible 😍
Paige and ronnie are my mom and dad
Holy shit i love it <3
Idk if u guys know but paige is in the music video
the screams!!!! old ETF vibes
Love from INDONESIA ❤
I love this band. From start until now. Just...wow....
well at least Ronnie doesn't sparkle when the sun shines
wat the fuck
Look here Mr. Radke ya gotta stop setting my headphones ablaze OK its beginning to become an expensive tab
On Broadway this would put Phantom of The Opera to shame.
YAS
I love this video and I love this band.Paige you are a very wonderful person.
No one gonna talk about Paige being in here
He's back !!!!
This is epitaph?? Am I being catfished???
The guy doesn't age so ...... pretty sure he is a vampire lol
Getting the same feel with Avenged Sevenfold's A Little Taste Of Heaven.
Please Ronnie if you see this, "raised by wolves" but with this style! Both of your new versions have given me goosebumps with every replay, and to hear RBW in that style would seriously make my year so much better
I felt emo again
ah its Paige! cool
better love story than twilight
37x repeat: Still not sure if a short movie with an awesome soundtrack or a music video.  Ps. Didnt see any hints but im hoping for raised by wolves next!
anyone catch the Paige scream at the end? 6:04
My friends:how many times have you listened to that song???(not knowing FIR) Me:YES
THIS IS AMAZING OMG
Better than the original
Hi Paige
This guy gets alot of hate, but people can't deny he's so talented. He's a great singer, song writer, multi-instumentalist, and composer. Dude, that's actually him playing the piano! How could you hate on that??
He looks like Professor Snape :)
DAMM
Teen angst be like.
If I remember correctly, this is exactly one year after "the drug in me is reimagined". That was released on the 13th of Feb 2020..
You can hate him but in the end you need to respect him
Let’s GOOOOOOO
I'm all over these revamped videos
This was visually stunning. Like everyone involved did a phenomenal job. This was one of my favorite falling in Reverse songs and what really got me into the band in 2013 along side The Drug In Me Is You. So Let’s talk about the music. This sounds like a Hard Rock John Williams orchestral. Ronnie singing is beautiful but my favorite part has to be the end. When the music and strings get intense and Ronnie starts doing his distortion screams and holding  it long as he did reminds me of a ‘Sempiternal’ Olí Sykes when he screams. It gave me goosebumps. Like Nik Nocturnal said Falling In Reverse has failed to miss yet. Everything after Popular Monster has been bangers 🔥
THIS BRINGS BACK SO MUCH MEMORIES AHHHHHHHH I FREAKING LOVE THIS
this is sooooo great!!! Ronnie is a genious! I love this song! <3
Just love your voice in this. Just pure amazement.!
first
I may be way off, but I feel like at 6:03 the image in the sky is Derek Jones looking down on Ronnie.
This needs to be a play on Broadway 🎭
If he does another one it’s probably gonna be Raised By Wolves, but imagine one for Good Girls Bad Guys 😂 I really want one for The Westerner.
just wanna say, listening to the end part when the monks chime in with his screaming gave me goosebumps, HOT DAMN! 😢👏👏👏
That haunting piano music is everything!
If this man does win EVERY award that exists then what is life....
Esto es muy hermosoooo!! Me volví adicta a esta canción, Again :))
The king of the music scene!
Муражки! Просто, муражки!!! Супер! И песня и клип!
Feels better listening to the song years ago then listening to this. You can see how the graphics, story, music, and quality ages well, Ronnie you are definitely like the finest quality of wine mah dude, ages well 🔥🔥🔥
I’m freaking obsessed!!!
So I'm the only one that doesn't like the redoing of the songs?
Клип отличный,песня херня!!
This gives me newer AFI vibes
Tá tão lindo que pqp
This slowing down remake of an older song worked for The Drug in Me Is You. This had weird pacing and I didn't really care for it. How about just make good new material?
Holy shit this video was intense! I love Falling In Reverse so much! So much talent in that band!
Absolutely love this!! 🔥 🖤
LOVED THE PIANO SOLO RONNIE 👀
omg i shat myself.
I loved the drug in me is you reimagined, but I think he kinda missed the mark here with what was so good about reimagined. It was so powerful and emotional, this felt a bit flat to me 🤷‍♀️ just one girls opinion, still love you Ronnie!
Hell yeah, trending 🖤🧛🏻
Is that paige?
My friend recommended me this; a complete fucking masterpiece! Also, one of thoughts going through my head the entire time was  "This looks like the mansion in the 'Tonight Is The Night I Die' music video Palaye just put out."
Wow!
This should be in the soundtrack for Marvel's Morbius movie next year
Ronnie was born to play a vampire
Smash it everytime! 👌
this was beautiful! I actually had this song stuck in my head for months now so its quite the coincidence it was remade
This is unbelievable .... Wow I had chills all this time, Ronnie, your voice is beautiful, I'm crying, haha
yes
Ehhhh, this wasn't executed as well as The drug in me is You reimagined.
Omg how I’m I only seeing this nowww
I’m gagging I’m dying I’m in love everything fr🥰😍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteous. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
This song and drug in me is you reimagined would go perfect with a tim Burton animation movie.
Это просто невероятно... до мурашек 🔥
Love this shit, Ronnie. Nothing makes me happier these days than seeing a revamped song from you. Absolutely amazing, as usual.
Damn imagine dying twice in less than 5 hours
I'm getting interview with a vampire and queen of the damned vibes from this Ronnie you are a genius rest in peace Derek
Just as excited for the song as wells as the fact that Paige (WWE) is in the video
*Mauro Ranallo voice* MAMA MIA THATS PAIGEE!!
Absolutely amazing...these revamped songs are fucking epic. Thank you ronnie and thank you Falling In Reverse....please keep them coming

This is a masterpiece

that video deserves an Oscar...
This is such a beautiful creation, the music, the singing, the video, and the dedication to Derek 😭❤️ he would be so so so proud
Who is Derick?
Holy fuck. I mean seriously. Color me impressed.
Bro can someone say goosebumps!! That was AMAZING
Ronnie Ur a fucking genious <3 I can feel this song, like a curse in my veins!!!! Thank you so much!
god i love his voice
Not much better than piano in metal or rock music
"Revamped" love it 😂
The original is still a fantastic song but this Re'Vamped' is an epic in itself and shows Ronnie's Artistic talent on so many levels... I've followed his career since the ETF days and I'm in awe with the way he has evolved into the beast he  is today. Ronnie and FIR never ceases to amaze me.
Ok who’s getting a ball gown with me and running in a castle? Any volunteers?
[Verse 1] Well, I'm not a vampire, but I feel like one Sometimes I sleep all day 'cause I hate the sunlight My hands are always shaking Body's always aching, and the dark is when I feed Well, I can lure any woman that I want to in my bed with me  [Pre-Chorus 1] And whiskey seems to be my holy water And mothers, better lock your doors and hide your daughters  [Chorus] 'Cause I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold? For goodness sakes, where is my self-control? If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all hope  [Verse 2] Well, I'm not a zombie, but I feel like one today Self-induced comatose, chemical daze My head is always spinning from this dizzy blurry vision and my stomach has had enough I feel like a lady that is pregnant with a baby 'cause I'm always throwing up  [Pre-Chorus 2] And hi, my name is Ronnie, I'm an addict And daddy should've never raised me on Black Sabbath  [Chorus] I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold? For goodness sakes, where is my self-control? If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all hope  [Post-Chorus] When will you mortals believe? (He's not a vampire) I just want the world to bleed (He's not a vampire) Lust at the sight of your blood (He's not a vampire) I swear to God, I am not a— (He is not a—) (He is not a—)  [Bridge] So God bless all of you now 'Cause I'm going straight to Hell (Straight to Hell) And I'm taking you down with me Because you know damn well  [Pre-Chorus 3] So I sharpen my teeth 'cause I love the way it feels When I sink into your skin and draw the only thing that's real You don't believe me, should I write it in blood? You better drive that fucking stake right down my heart and try to run Motherfucker, I'm a vampire  [Chorus] And I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold? For goodness sakes, where is my self-control? If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all Heart has fucking lost all Heart has lost all hope (He's lost all hope) (He's lost all hope) (He's lost all hope) All hope, my heart has lost all hope
It gives off interview with a vampire vibes and I LOVE IT
Perhaps listening to my SoundCloud might be the play for us all. Johnny Smoke.... The  one from the Greater Boston Area...Some scoundrel is releasing under my name  and his songs are on my YouTube profile So don't listen to those and think they  are me. Those are not my songs. They might be decent or better than that, but  he should release under a different name and stop being a scoundrel. Not  knowing me, that's bad for business. Donations are obliged! Thank you,  very much.         Also,  I’ll go to bat for anyone with the best ethical standards. It would be stupid  not to… Me in the Show coming soon. My TV shows coming… My books coming… my album  coming… my movies coming. X-Factor Enterprises corporation up and running coming…  Everything else good or better coming…. Exponential amounts of dollars to me coming.  I certainly deserve it. That’s good-business. Life… the dream… the fantasy… that’s  good-or-better-business. Good-or-better-business that might be the best  adjective on Earth. Who invented it. Well, who do you think? Yep, you guessed  it. Me. If I have it we have it. I certainly do have it. So, we certainly do have  it. That’s big-time money. You should have to pay me to reply to this. I should  be able to have that option. Just like donate 2 cents or more and you can reply.  There is a link to a PayPal donation portal on my Soundcloud. The one from the  first paragraph. Its good-or-better-business to donate. If you do… the best  content ever might just get finalized but before that I must have dollars… to  buy me some freedom to complete all of it for us. I might need a big team. I  have a lot of content drawn up. How else might I put this…. I’m always good-or-better-business.        ********Listening to the catalog of songs on my SoundCloud 10/10 would-recommend*******
I like that he's 'reimagining' some of his songs , I can't wait for the one he's doing to come out properly with vocals.. - popular monster, reimagned
Ronnie nailed it!!!! This is incredible!!!!!!
This is ridiculous. It was incredibly hard to take seriously given the original is about addiction. Honestly, this was fucking laughable.
words cant define how amazing this is
So he gonna make his old songs slow now? They pretty dope
That was beyond Epic. There are no words. Hauntingly beautiful.
This is a true emo. He has evolved into a real life vampire.
Que isso, fenomenal ;)
so epic ... ronnie is so underrated
Великолепие ❤️_❤️
My god!!!!! So fucking talented
Straight chill bumps🥰🥰
I JUST WANT THE WORLD TO BLEED!!!!!!

https://youtu.be/Kx01r2reeoE
🖤💀
I liked, before the video started knew it would be amazing.
I'm not a huge can of using the word "epic" cause I overused it as an angsty teen but there really isn't another word to describe these reimagined songs he has been doing.  That was epic AF, wow.
ME ENCANTA ♥️
God dayum did not see that coming let alone the way he nailed them vocals. Have me chills. What next pick up the phone?
Ronnie gave me chills throughout my entire body. I'm stunned. Wow
Such a beautiful video
RIP Derek 😔
Yessss❤❤❤
This is amazing. Ronnie is KING!
Growing up with this song I never thought this song could get any better, Ronnie said hold my blood goblet
Okay I’m obsessed
Here comes the childhood emo in me as an adult once again
Paige looks so good here omgggg
OMFG Ronnie can do whatever he fucking wants and I love it, this man will be listened to by our grandchildren I swear! Definitely a legend in the genre!!
Was wondering why music was dropping left and right, forgot about Valentine’s Day lol *sad puppy* haha -regards
i wanna get married 2 this video
Holyyyyyy fuckinnnggggggg shittttttt  WOW  INCREDIBLE
That evil laugh of ronnie at 3:36 😂 its make me cant stop thinking that it could appear on 1 of some tim burton movies, i like his theatrical  voice a lot ❤
This is pretty darn good.  A remake of an old song, boy this is talent.  Amazon and car hop trays, stay safe.
Being an avid WWE fan and Falling in Reverse fan, it makes me so happy to watch Paige and Ronnie all in one kickass music video!
Favorite song being remade is dope af, only would've added an awesome vampire fight scene to the music video, if you watch when high it will blow your mind away so much!!
🖤
There goes my Idol Paige she is doing amazing job in this video! 👏🏾❤
That might have been the most amazing video I've ever seen 🤘🏻😮
Watching this for the 15th time Am I obsessed?  Yeah.. I'm obsessed
OMFG🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I’m waiting for chemical prisioner now
seeing him with long hair makes me think to myself  he has been born to look good with a  long hair
The best thing I’ve seen in a loooong time!!!!!!
Ronnie Whit long hair😍😍
Felt like i was watching a very dramatic play, ill be tinsy bit critical (who cares) and say the begining felt a little forced with the lyrics, but the middle to end was outstanding. Great job Ronnie!
*standing ovation*
That’s not Ronnie that’s Ròñńįë
This is badass it reminds me of the movie John Carpenter's Vampires
So you went from werewolf to vampire......that's beast!!! 😈
Man... Men...I'm not a vampire is my favorite song of Falling in Reverse since so many years... This version is...incredible...
Is watching Ronnie getting and better! 😳😳😱😱😱😍😍
Awesome - Simply AWESOME! Love seeing Paige. Never seen her like THAT!! And Ronnie is a Modern day Legend!! 🤘⭐️🤘

Michael radkson
i knew something was different about Ronnie in this video but it took 2 times of watching until i realized his tattoos were gone O-O
Is there anything this man CAN’T do?!?! And can we talk about how timeless Saraya looks?!?! I get goosebumps every time I watch it.
Ronnie which direction are you going musically? Ronnie: yes
"Revamp" I see what u did there.
Can't get over how good this is
You never cease to amaze me😁
Situations? Or is it just irrelevant now?
Очень мощное произведение
Paige killed it.
Fucking amazing!!! 🔥👏
Better than a movie

HOLY SHIT THIS IS AMAZING
HOLY SHIT
This is actually the greatest vocal performance I’ve heard in my life. Amazing.
rest in peace  Derek Jones
My one and only Saraya in a metal video.. I am so proud of you ma champ.. 🔥❤️Such a goddess..
True artist. Runs kinda funny. But really good artist.
We need the whole album like this
I think Ronnie would make a great coach on the voice
Who else thinks ronnie should try to join the wwe?
Just...  *REVAMPED*
Yo that was dope.. pretty bad ass that he had paige in there with him.. even when wwe might need her...
Te amo
we need a vampire netflix series with ronnie
MOVIE STRAIGHT MOVIE
https://youtu.be/xED1SQbAR3E
epic bro, kinda got some a7x vibes
Now this is the Edward Cullen I wanted 😂😂.  This is just stunning! His voice. The video. RONNIE 😍
Rest In Peace Derek ❤️
I'm convinced Falling in reverse is a genre not a band.
reminder that this is the dude who had a line about "shitting in pampers" holy shit how far we've come.
Freddy Mercury would be proud!
Chills...
Holy damn, guys..... you crushed it.
This song is good. Who agrees
Next time I see Falling In Reverse live, it better be in a theatre with stage designs, props and an orchestra. Radke: An American Musical
Chills🥶🥶
Wow. Just wow. Most amazing song & video I’ve ever seen. This mom’s talents are so underrated. Incredible🖤
Wrestling Hub reported about former WWE's "Paige" made her music video debut with boyfriend Ronnie Radke. Is that true 🤔?
WWE PAIGE in a music video
No wonder it doesn't say official video. It's a movie. 🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘
NEXT!  Good Girls Bad Guys!
Just keeps getting better and better
This song always reminds me of Twilight
that paige?
Re-Vamp-ed 🧐
YOU ARE AMAZING
I love you sm dude
Masterpeace!
Is Ronnie the new Lestat?
Can't wait for the next one: "Chemical Prisoner (Recidivist)"
damn i am not ready for this jskskskdks
Ronnie, this was pretty good, but somehow I feel like it missed the mark. I liked it but not nearly as much as your other recent work, including the drug in me is you reimagined.
Bro yes!!! This way my go to song in middle/high school! Now 26 years old and I love this also
RIP to fans that don't know the original
wow
Just....wow.
Jesus Christ... fucking Ronnie radke and Falling in reverse I swear      Killin it like always. This is fucking incredible!!!!
Anne Rice called. She needs this song for The Vampires Chronicles trailer.
The “so god bless all of you now” part is like maybe the best vocal I’ve ever heard Ronnie produce, he’s made some incredible stuff over the years but how incredible his voice has been sounding these last couple of years is mighty impressive I love artists who literally get better at what they do be it vocals or instruments it’s really impressive to me to see professionals still getting better
Epicly well done!!! Ronnie keep it up man love yalls music
Was about to not like this cuz it was too similar to his other remastered song then he goes and switches things up... Genius!
Did that just make me cry? YES
Harrowing, but beautiful
Actually got goosebumps
PAGIE IS STUNNING
✨LATE✨ fuck im sorry im late lol
Great voice Ronnie, but when am I going to get more songs like Popular Monster and Drugs?
We waantt 2033 ronnie with blonde bairstyle❤

Its kinda losing my life intro reversed
Great track
This is WAY over the top!
🤯🖤
Absolutely awful. What the fuck
Ronnie is so freaking talented.
On repeat for hours...
I love the fact that they did a video similar in style to that of "The Drug Is Reimagined" ♥️❤️♥️
i cant believe what i see in 2021, this is epic!
This is perfection, props 💪🏼
The vampires are: Ronnie, Kellin, and Gerard they don't seem to age  convinced every emo band has ONE vamp among them
Please revamp all your old schools, specially raised by the wolves, situations and not good enough for cliche those are my favorites songs please
I can't enough of these reimagined and revamped versions of their songs man...omg 😍😍
This is truly a masterpiece omg
fuck i love it
I' m a Warewolf...
Give this man an award, not a golden globe because this is actually worth something.
HE'S DONE IT AGAIN, I'M CRYING🥺🔥❤️
This is another masterpiece. Amazing. I have chills everytime I hear this. And when he shouts along with the choir and sings/screams in an ironic, "one night before Christmas" style, maaan this is fucking awesome. FIRE 🔥
wait what...
you’re kidding🥺🖤🖤
I need to learn every lyric,  so that I may sing this song, I LOVE it
what an epic 30th birthday present...now to buy tickets to the concert...
Definitely like the original better but I like the feel of the video
Ronnie this was seriously incredible 🔥
@5:10 the chillls
I would sell what is left of my soul to live in this music video
PAIGE!!!
Never been a huge fan of this band, they're good don't get me wrong just their older stuff wasn't really my style but this is just stunning. Same with the other older songs they've redone. The way they've reimagined these songs to add more depth and feeling to them (paired with a great video) is just amazing and shows how talented they are. I think like another person said, this band matures with you or ages like a fine wine I'd say!
Waiting for the "Pick Up The Phone" remake 👇👇👇👇
Holy. Shit. 🔥
reVAMPed
RONNIE= G.O.A.T
INCREDIBLE
*claps for hours*
Tuman koe ron
Nah man Ronnie is just in another fucking level!! And so glaaaad to se paige here! Maaaaaan! This is hitting in the feelings! Can we make a movie like this? Plase! Please!! Damn it!
This guy is such an artist!!!  Gets me everytime in every song. Greetings from Colombia!!
Maybe I'm the only one who started singing bring me to life instead 🤣😭😭😭 I feel guilty
Whaou..... Fantastic FIR
One word: Indescribable.
Damn it Ronnie...
#VampireForever
Pure talent and a musical genius!!! My mind has been blown!
That was by far the best vampire movie I've ever seen.
Love how cinematic all FIR new videos are.
You are totally changing the game Ronnie my man. Big respect
AMAZING
Immaculate
Came here just for paige She is awesome
Holy fuck, this may be one of my favorite music videos ever
🔥🔥🔥 you better win something for this. The stuff you are putting out nobody is doing. The video is epic. The sound is big. You should turn this stuff into a play. Like a rock opera or something.
You did it again always impressing me with your music like I really can't stop watching it it was amazing good job
Dude..... this is insane. I love the original. This is something else entirely.....
Whats this aesthetic called cuz im in love
Ronnie man you are something else man , thank you so much for being Ronnie
Sweet jesus that was a masterpiece!
High Lord Alucard  #castlevania
Wow also nice, that he was not a twilight vampire but a classic one
Was hoping for a new song tbh, I like it but its been over a year now since Popular Monster.
Paige looks so gorgeous in this video 😍😍😍 I love her in simple make up but she is such a badass with full glam as well !!!
Was worried about showing this to my Gf.  Didn't want her getting jealous of me fancying Ronnie
Ronnie looks like professor Snape
Join now our team with over 130+ members, look our 1st video at join us by the joining the link at our description ✌🏼
I don't know what comment here except                          Wow...
Once again fantastic vocals but yet again this didn't need a remaster
This is beautiful in so many ways.   So incredibly talented ❤
Who knew Ronnie cleaned up so nice and could pull off the vampire look?
Just Wow!! Just when I think I couldn’t be anymore impressed with Ronnie.. And then he’s always topping what he has done previously.. Goosebumps all the way through.. I look so forward to his stuff.. Absolutely Amazing!
I know you get this ronnie.... but I'm still only bumping the originals lol.... not bad though
Similar to "The Drug in Me Is You," I personally don't prefer it over the original, but it's a great reimagining of a classic and a great music video too!! If the original song was a 10/10 this is definitely a 9 :D
it is perfect!
When you were that drama kid before you became a vampire:
As someone who's been a fan of Ronnie since ETF, I'm so damn pumped
Vampires making it through the pandemic too
That's insane
This is a whole movie
Ronnie is a modern day Ozzie. Not so much in content but the vibes he gives off on these remakes is ridiculous. Emo jam to rock power ballads.
Im just waiting for  "The Drug In Me Is Reimagined, Again" Like how Ronnie said he would do it in his Twitch
*Me throughout the video* : 🤨
What if Ronnie and Gerard Way teamed up for a rock opera album?
https://youtu.be/7EV7y486AU4 this romanian rap or this song
OH MY FUCKING WORD. GOOSE BUMPS ALL OVER !
So fucking good, damn ❤️❤️❤️
Paige is beautiful in this!
Still a better love story than Twilight,  AMAZING job Ronnie.  This was brilliant.
Soy feliz 💜
Wow fuckin incredible! Like holy shit absolutely beautiful!
Holy shit. This is amazing. Literal chills
Ha! Re-Vamped
I’m okay I’m okay I’m okay I’m okay
The 600 people who disliked this are uncultured swine
Welp they did it again! Absolutely chilling and the music video bangs.
Smoke: you pick the wring music video fool Paige: smoke it's me Paige chil chill Smoke: Paige oooooooo my dawg whassup
lindoooo !!!
He looks like Loki in this video 😆
They did it again... A masterpiece from the masterpiece
RIP Derek Jones </3
Chills. Literal chills
It's the beat He hear it in his sleep sometimes Blare it in your jeep so your peoples can stare at them rhymes Real rhymes not your everyday hologram Even when ribs was touchin' never swallowed the ham He'd rather eat a sand sandwich salad It might need salt like your man's bland ballad A lot of stuff happens that the news won't tell yous Blues on L juice Snooze, all hell loose Rake it Take it like the good, the bad, the ugly Break it, rollin' through ya hood in the caddy buggy Butter softly, leather flossy, fatty juggy Always threw me off when she told me "Daddy funk me" I'm like anywho's Seeds walkin' all out in street with out any shoes I guess it's better than some funky socks You need to get her some skips before she catch the monkey pox Instead she wanna hear the beatbox Take pills and make fake krills as sheetrock Sing it Bring it, back to your laboratory While he's in his oratory Glorious like a horror story The mask is like Jason They told the place not to let the basket type case in He could be some kind of wacko Waitin' for the chance to heat the pipes like a crack ho He busted in Blessed be the Lord Who believe any mess they read up on a message board If so, I got bridges for the low low Same bitch'll a go dry snitchin' to the popo Here, orange peel stogs for the whole tier Feel like I've been gone over a year, came home to old gear It was the shit when I first scooped it At least I get to sit out in New York and curse stupid Plead the fifth Sip wine stiffly Patiently come up and be spiffy in a jiffy Gift for the grind Criminal mind shifty Swift with the nine through a fifty nine fifty Well edjumacated He heard it when he meditated in deep theta Let her hate the creep later Dedicated cheap skata who keeps data Stay he stay self medicated to sleep later Side effects is similar to sugar pill Whoever go next on the mic he put a booger eww And made his exit on some calm shit Begged him on the regular for kegs of more vomitspit  Source: LyricFind  Songwriters: Daniel Dumile Thompson  Vomitspit lyrics © Kobalt Music Publishing Ltd.  @dekagotgramz
Is that Paige
Fucking masterpiece
taporraaaaaaa maluco que somzão nostalgico fodaaaastico
This song seems like it needs a BRAVO MAGNIFICO!!!!!!!!!! 👏🙌😳
I always knew he was lying, this confirms it. Glad to see Saraya in the video. I think I prefer the original flavor, but this is pretty dope.
So hauntingly Beautiful! 🔥😍
Give me a rock opera ronnie 💗
I swear he is the new Freddy Mercury!!  He is not just an entertainer, but a master/genius of his craft😱🔥
absolute legend
The way he was able to make a completely new feel and meaning to the song by just changing a few lyrics and the orchestraeic additions... he is a fucking God. Forget his past, he bleeds PURE TALENT
😍😍😍😍😍😍
Genial ♡

#17 TRENDING IN ECUADOR 🥺🖤🇪🇨
Still a better story than twilight
WOW this was incredibly amazing 🥲😅 first saw it on Too Lit Mafia as a review.  How have I been asleep on soooo many great artists.
can i just say how beautiful saraya is...?
Amazing !
Now all I wanna do is be quarantined with a vampire and fall in love
MOTHERFUCKAAA IM A VAMPIYAHHH  I felt that
"Falling in Reverse: I'm not a Cat"
Your sudden genre changes never fail to amaze me you're all so bloody  talented
This reminds me of Interview with the vampire!😭😭😭💖💖💖💖💖
Always goosebumps when he sing with his amazing voice
Che capolavoro. Alcune cose sicuramente ispirate da il film " interview with the vampire".
WOW...just WOW
Ronnie's back!
This is absolutely beautiful! This music video feels like a movie and it's a damn good one at that! I've watched this 5 times now just for the story of the video. This revamped version also showcases Ronnie's voice in the best way possible. I'm kinda hoping he reimagines the entire first album now.
Soo good seeing paige in this
Another Banger! 💯🔥
It’s so dramatic... I love it
Loving this new trend of sentimental remasters that Ronnie's got going
Love it 💚
Another banger
holy fuck, now this is what i call EMO music.   the range of emotions this piece brought me...WOW just WOW
Holy shit that was fucking fantastic.
This video IS poetry, such craftmanship!
Looking forward to the "Good Girls, Bad Guys" remix where he sings "I just wanna kiss your lips, the ones between your hips" in a super dramatic ballad
im literally that surprised pikachu meme rn
Bravo bravo
Thanks! I’ll be listening to this on repeat until the end of time ☺️
HOLY SHIT, LOVE IT!
Так атмосферно!
Holy sh%tball’s this is on a whole new level of awesome! 🤯
Woooww
I didn’t know a good song could get even better 😱❤️
That ending tho, almost puked my heart out.
“For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. Therefore encourage one another with these words. Now, brothers and sisters, about times and dates we do not need to write to you, for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. While people are saying, “Peace and safety,” destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief. You are all children of the light and children of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness. So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be awake and sober. For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night. But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet. For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.” #LordJesusiscoming
Beyond great. I like the reference from the movie "interview with a vimpire". That was a nice touch!!
Fucking amazing 👏
I wonder if Ronnie is going to do this every year, last year the drug in me is reimagined and now this!! absolutely love what he's doing!!
Bruh, why is noone talking about Ronnie with no tattoos? im shook
Cringe. I swear, this band is like twilight was for tweens. Ronnie has such an ego. Dudes so self centered and toxic.
Ronnie put so much emotion into this beautiful and theatrical song. Awesome work!!
Holy shit this is incredible 🖤
Holy Sh** this song gave me goosebumps!! It's a heartbreaking roller coaster of emotions. I love it. Ronnie did it again!
I love 💘paigey
Paigey 😚😚😚😚

Damn that was interesting.
This guy is just fucking unbelievable...
So, you're Vampire or Werewolf. Ronnie?
👏🏼
A masterpiece , once again .

Poland fucking loves you, Ronnie Radke
Sick
Masterpiece!
We need more of this from them.
Gila babeng... Best betui
Insanely beautiful!
Youtube: 40th on trending Me: thats way to underrated
Can we make a counter... how many people got goosebumps ?
La verdad? tu no puedes manejar la verdad! por que cuando levantas los audifonos para escuchar una de la que fue tus canciones favoritas y ves que ahora es mucho MEJOR, uno no sabe que hacer!! olvidalo Marge! esto es el barrio chino!
A Masterpiece......
🖤🔪.
Nice
Theatricality and deception powerful agents against the uninitiated
Good girls bad guys I stg better be next revamp
Reminds me of meatloaf
Wow 😳
is this page in the video?
Wow what an amazing song to listen to after waking up
My god man... This is SO GOOD. The video is giving me Michael Jackson vibes all over the place. ThoSE VOCALS DUDE WTF. You guys are just amazing and ronnie ur crazy. Nothing but love and support from Argentins <3
They’ve done it again! Just beautiful!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥
I'll tell my kids this was Ozzy Osbourne
I love the direction where this is going
theatrical production Its great!!! second life for old song incredible, but Ronnie, Where new song ? last new song its popular monsters and seriously, you (falling in reverse) can make more great new hits. Why you didnt this ? im not vimpire great song, great new version, and i know, this song over1000000 streamng in my spotify, but we need new song! with love from Russia  ps: put in sucks
You Just need to put out a reimagined album. I need the songs on vinyl they would sound amazing
This is a masterpiece WOW!!!
YES
oh my GOD
I have no idea what's this evolution we're witnessing, but... Goddammit! I'm so here for it!
One hell of a track and video. This man is a bloody genius. Also extra points for the juicy "reVAMPed" pun
Holy hell i didn't know this Guy was so tallanted sitting here whith goosebumps
please make this into a series like trapped in the closet
(:
Paige <3
I'm sorry for saying this but this had Palaye Royale's name written all over it. Just saying. Ain't dissing them, just saying.
Pleasantly surprised this is on trending,that was not a song,that was an experience.Ronnie just keeps topping himself song after song.Keep up the amazing material guys.
The editing, the narrative, the emotion and Ronnie's vocals were absolutely insane. This was epic. On top of that, Paige (Ronnie's gf) appearing in here was great.
If any other artist had produced this, I probably would not have become as intrigued as it is outside my general preference. But this was beyond beautiful. He may not be a vampire, but he sure is a magician. Incredible.
wow
HOLLLLLYYYYY SHIT! 👏
Am I the only one that noticed that when the "Hi, Ronnie" is supposed to happen, he nods his head like "nope, not this time"
Came to shit on this.  Left feeling awestruck.
this is the definition of Masterpiece
Норм. медляк
Amazing!!
Эпичная баллада
Way better vampire movie than twilight.
Holy fuck
Ronnie looks like Loki
We're not worthy
round 2 for revamped. damn, he's remaking his own legacy
Dramatically running to a hill instead of facing confrontation is mood.
*Van Helsing intensifies*
Unpopular opinion: the original was better 🤷🏽‍♂️
Page from wwe is absolutely awesome in this I’m Francewall mortaries
"God is real. God loves you. God wants the best for you. Believe that. I do."  Chris Pratt
Yes but, why in every fucking song at the end you have to crossover with hardcore scream? I appreciate them but jesus it is the same structure in the last the drug in me is you, drugs, popular monster, losing my life.
Classy ending, rest in peace Derek.
Ronnie Radke is capable to do anything expect  RUUUUN 3:47  There is a Justice 🙏🏼
So about that revamped album?!?!
„Wer bin ich?, usw.“ sind die falschen Fragen. Die richtigen Fragen lauten: Was bin ich zurzeit und was kann ich noch* wirklich werden*? Was ist der Plan und was das wahre Ziel des Lebens? Verantwortung bedeutet: ich suche nach Antworten auf meine Fragen, veranlasse mich, durch hingebungsvolles und konsequentes Handeln dazu, Erkenntnisse zu erhalten, die Wirklichkeit in mir zu entdecken. Nur darum geht es. Es gibt keine individuellen Lebenswege, nur in der Illusion. In Wirklichkeit gibt es nur den einzigen Weg, der zur Heilung/Ganzwerdung führt, um dadurch die Wirklichkeit in sich erreichen zu können. <3 wir-kl-ich-keit de
Give us this for Valentine's Day, a love like this! Or don't waste our time. Perfect!!
Bruhhhh!
Wow. Goosebumps throughout
Wow amazing video
Interview with a Ronnie Radke.
wow very impressive ✌️😎👍
Legend
Holy shitballs is the best description of this revamped version... Ronnie's voice has no limit man.. goosebumps all over! Absolutely stunning, music, vocals, visuals.❤
Amazing,i need more song like this 🔥🔥
Gay
What a masterpiece. The song, the MV all is perfect. It's Falling in love at falling in reverse
This was absolutely breathtaking..
Very cinematic 🔥🔥🔥
Next please revamp popular monster and raised by the wolves would be fucking awesome
FEELS
Creazy song 😍
Am I the only one who has noticed Paige from WWE in here? 🤔
now I want to go and watch all the vampire movies I know. 🌘
In Loving Memory Of Derek Jones
an absolute masterpiece once again
Очень красивый клип. И голос певца тоже
They revamped my favourite Falling in Reverse song, and somehow made it better!!!
Кто от Элины 🥰❤️
We could turn this into a movie 🤔
Not usually my bag of music. But this was damn good. Paige could go be an A list actress if she wanted to.
Unholy shit, that was amazing. Absolutely stunning filmed and it gave me shiver down my spine 🤘
I'll be spending this coming week binge watching all reaction channel reacting to this 😆
Jesus am I watching a musical? I've never heard anything like this, I'm impressed
wtf did I just watch, and why was it so awesome lol
Best part 3:19 should have been attack on titan op for the final season
Gross.. ugh. What is going on right now?!  Drug in me is you was so much better... this is too much.. Take me back to the Ronnie at the bonfire with zero f*cks given.
I literally got chills when he started screaming near the end
ronnie dressed as a vampire hits
playboi carti does it way better😂😂
Assassins creed - Transylvania (official soundtrack)
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
No one else can perform a rebirth of a classic like Ronnie does. Ronnie is a fuckiin' magician.
Is that paige
That was just EPIC❤️
Am I the only one that's picking up on an interpretation of what Paige has endured while loving Ronnie? He's been open about his struggles and she has loved him through them all. He truly cherishes her.
I was not prepared for that. Wow. This was incredible 🤙
HE'S PRETTY THAN HIS WIFE HAHAHAHAHA BUT I LOVE IT SO MUCH RONNIEEEEEEEE!!😍
This is so awesome!
this is art.
Not going  on my playlist but still love it
I can't be the only one who thinks Ronnie Radke should play the Phantom in the Phantom of the Opera...His vocal range leaves me speechless
Woah! His vocals  are getting better and better  🥰🤩
Ronnie is  just a king.
joder sean pasao el juego
Okay so we all know where he disappeared to, and we're all happy about it now. This is amazing
This is a fcking piece of art.
Кто от Элины?
"That's what true vampire would say" - Dean Winchester *draws out machette from pants back pocket*
That's more than i would ask for. GOREGOUS ⚰️🖤🥤👏👏👏
Is that Paige as lady dimitrescu? 😂
Instant classic. Unbelievably dark, tragic, powerful, epic.
Queen 2.0
Why am I crying??
Just heard this. I love the video and the song is good. I think I kinda like the reimagined version of The Drug In Me Is You better though.
That was awful
Que Owen Wilson "wow" on repeat
WOW....
First the drug in me is reimagined and now this? Pure art, this simply goes far beyond the concept of “song”. Unbelievable
farkin amazing
Remember the vampire teeth in the „The Drug in me is reimagined“ music video at 2:50 minutes? What if Ronnie planned this transition the whole fucking time??? I love it!
Goosebumps...
Paige (from wwe) killed this I loved it
Breathtaking <3
It’s so weird seing Ronnie without any faces tattoos
OMG this is a masterpiece! There is nothing Ronnie can't do!
Is no one gonna point out Paige?!?!
Best Spotify suggestion I've gotten so glad I'm this early to this masterpiece
Falling in reverse has always been my favourite band, and paige has always been my favourite wwe wrestler, so seeing their talent merge together is so frickin cool
This is how all vampires should sing
thats his wife right?
sure that you aren't a vampire? ronnie: 5:04
Why does he look younger and better with age? I'm shook.
THAT'S A MASTERPIECE!
Its like he intentionally let his hair grow long as in his old vid and to reflect to the max to this reVAMPment FKING LOVE IT!!!!!!  Wiskey seems to be my holy water~~
ähm... WOW O.o
One of the few true artists we have.
Rock to Classical
PAIGE!!!!
Next time Raised by Wolves (Rewolfed) please! :D
Bequeathed Beauty unto thee.
Hell Yeah
It's so solid but nothing like feeling 14 when blasting the original
X: Perfection doesn't exist... Ronnie: Hold my beer
viego is that you
backup singers singing "straight to hell" was hilarious good job boys
Nice
Ronnie this is perfect! The next step is - big movie 🎥🔥
Bravo. 👏
oh my God, the video editing, the update, the music combines with the video clip .. the truth wow 👏👏 greetings from 🇦🇷🇦🇷

Is this really Paige😍
I kinda like it, idk kinda miss the emo but way more epic

This is just insane... Let you without words at the end, what a masterpiece
I’m not gay but. Fuck. Me. That was amazing.
First reaction: SHOCK! 👁️👄👁️ Shock because I can't still be emo in 2021!!!
Fucking awesome ronnie
I cant explain my emotions!!! It is so amazing that I'm crying right now ♥
Before I pushed play, I reminded myself to enjoy every moment of hearing this for the first time.  I knew this would be epically beautiful.
Still a better storyline than twighlight though
ily ronnie
Me gusta más la original 😅
This is a masterpiece. ♥ Congratulations to FIR and all the people who worked on this project! It's amazing! And Rest in Peace, Derek 🙏🏼 we will never forget you! ♥
30 сек, когда девушка просыпается - Элина, это же вы... и, я так понимаю вы в принципе дублёршей были главной героини, там где сдвоенные сцены были.
OMFG THAT'S CLEARLY AMAZING
That was epic with goosebumps!
I miss michael Jackson. You amazing ronnie 🔥
The only thing that I can say is "wow". His voice is magical. He is one of the most talented artists. He can scream, can do clean vocals and can rap. He is unique
You ain't making Music Videos anymore, these Movies!
I love this so much holy shit
The drug in me remimagined, I'm not a vampire revamped, what's next crying about good girls with bad guys?
This is insane... I'm blown away
That section 2/3 through sounds like Sam from zombies lol
This version has more emotions than the original.. love it!!
Omg,this is awesome 😍
As ideal as always
Didn't know the original. Clicked because of YouTube's recommandations (already known "The drug in me is reimagined" by the same way). I'm just totally amazed by the quality of the vocals, the instrumental, the clip. The true definition of "holy shit" ! No words to tell how PERFECT this song is. "Chapeau bas", Falling in reverse !
Woah
Hey you're just ripping off playboy carti wtf
Amazing clip⚡️
I am happy
😍😍😍
This monster is getting popular...
I'm glad I've been supporting Ronnie since DIYLF, the man has proved his doubters wrong time and time again. Despite everything this man has been through, he's never gave up. Never stopped doing what he loves, and I respect the shit outta him for that. Now hurry up, get your arse in gear and sort out that much needed U.K. Tour.
Listened to it 30 times since it came out yesterday. This is so fuu***** amazing!
OMG
Paaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaiiiigeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee, this is your house 😀😍😍😊😊
Ronnie Radke has improved so much. I'm so proud of him From a Werewolf to a Vampire  Cheers from Portugal
Ronnie has outdone himself yet again!!!  Congrats..,🎉 🍾 keep moving forward and keep doing what you do best! Much love ❤️
ronnie finally puts paige in a FIR music video hahah nice
Ok but raised by wolves remake when
05:05 I'M VAMPIREEEEEEEEEEEE   Really love that part
If their next album was this genre, I would not be mad. This is crazy talent & versatile.
This is pure greatness.
Oh my god This is so dramatic and amazing
Ronnie just out here makin movies. Good shit.

Really?? OMG, I don't know what is said after hearing a wonder like this 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
Here because of Paige
Holy Shit dude

Well done! And Very Very EPIC! OUTSTANDING ART!
Fans - Ronnie made already a second version of "I'Not a Vampire" we can't expect a Better version.  -Ronnie : Hold My Beer Mtf
I love a good rock opera edit, nice job Ronnie!
He finally did it guys. Ronnie done lost his shit. Lay this godly man to rest.
Awesomeness 🥺 this is one of my favorites. Plus the other that he made .
10/10🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸👍👌👏
this is the best thing i’ve ever seen and heard. this is is
Congratulations to Saraya  I remember that in a twich live Ronnie said that his makap-artist is she. In this video she is amazing (Ronnie too)
This gives me Michael Jackson ghosts vibes
Ronnie is a god among men, love this mate
This is insane
M for fcking MASTERPIECE..nothing less just obsessed!
A proof that ronnie Can reinvent his own songs and make them even Better then before.
Вот это просто показательный образец роста и развития человека и музыканта. Из эмо-панка в шедевральной композитора. Ронни, ты очень крут! Thanks for this wonderful job! Great video and song!
Damn this is fire and goodness gracious Paige too, great acting on her part.
Please PLEASE consider a “Pick Up The Phone” reimagined!!
3:53 - 4:20 is the definition of chills
It's just difficult to express with words after watching this. Art in it's purest form.
I needed this today and i didn't even know
A fucking genius.
Mark my words raised by wolves will be next as a follow up or prelude to popular monster 👍🏼🥳
Oh my God this was AMAZING! Making a whole ass movie :) I love it. Hoping for more like this! Good Girls Bad Guys would be pretty neat
THIS IS GENIUS EXCITED
Incredible.
Amazing!!!! Derek Jones we miss u.
Mantap
Это шедеврально !       (´｡• ω •｡)
Ronnie, this a incredible. Congrats!
💯
Omg this is 5he most beautiful 5hing I've heard in my life omg he really is the king of the music scene this guy is my religion
Twilight : "We do best vampire movie!"  Ronnie Radke & FIR : "Old my beer"  Seriously Ronnie when you gonna start doing movie? Damn
i expected him to look exactly like that tbh
Wow...I have no words. This is a pure masterpiece
Удивительное владение голосом!
Damn another bad ass revamp of an old FIR classic. Just when I thought this video couldn't get any better it did, Saraya A.K.A. Paige is in the video. Ronnie you are one talented dude
Epitaph is lucky to still have him signed lol love it.
3:50 i love this part
Falling In Reverse just outhorrored Ice Nine Kills.
Damn THIS WAS A MASTERPIECE
These song remakes make you realise the depth of song writing talent Ronnie has always had. He is an artist. A true artist.
Man ETF should have never dis this dude lol
lol Make new music,  Still i love this
HOLY SHIT
Better than twilight
No se si me gusto o no🤔
These last two remakes have been absolutely amazing. As a person who just like Ronnie has been on both sides of the rollover coaster that is addiction, meaning hopelessly heading for death while trying to drown out the world and now being clean with a family. These songs, both the originals and the new ones are a crazy emotional ride to listen to. It’s absolutely beautiful.
Necesito que haga esto con todas las canciones del grupo 🥺🙌🏻😭
Please my god remake raised by wolves
a beautiful and emotional piece of art. i was captivated from the beginning
what a masterpiece! missing you Derek!
Why did I cry? That was amazing
Masterpiece! Just like "The Drug In Me Is You".
i am legitimately shooketh😳 what can’t this man do???
A beauty that cannot be described in words!  Ronie just keep going !!!
I'm not a vampire - video of vampires..
What the..  ..amazing remake
Not really sure what to say. This is incredible. We are so lucky to have found Ronnie. He has grown into a real star and icon. F*cking perfection.
At this point I'm hoping Ronnie re-does all his past songs like this cause this is fucking beautiful!
Well, would complain about how music's changed but nothing stays the same.  Either way, Imma do what my mum does since I'm getting up there now. Drink my coffee in a corner and hope that everyone can find a home in their music.
RR = 🐐
Still, better love story than twilight
Poland are you here? <3 !!!
I’m pissed from this new version but I’m impressed how good he sounds, but tbh I still prefer the original. But bitch Im been bit from this song.
Wow so 🔥🔥 so beautifuel @FaIR ( Falling In Reverse )
I thought he's not a vampire.
Fuck me this was powerful
A fucking movie 😍
i don't know how many times i came back to see this mv, this mv gave me goosebumps..
Too bad he couldn’t scream like this live anymore... had to pull the mic away from himself. just given a false hope....
This was fun to watch and listen love it
What a jojo reference nice
Ronnie has said when he writes songs this how hears them in his head. Like big, bombastic vocals and all that stuff. I think he just finally has the money and creative freedom to make some of those songs come to life the way he always wanted them to. This particular song, I like better with the rock sound, but it’s fire as fuck in this way. What an underrated talent.
This better get 100 million views
Dark shadows vibes
That "God bless all of you now" was fucking bone-chilling. A+ all around FANTASTIC
Does he not say black sabbath in this?
Paige!!!
revamped ❤️
We need a whole album of songs like this
What the fuck man. Falling In Reverse . There old stuff was good but back then it wasn’t really my cup of tea, but I can appreciate it for what it was. But god dammit, the last few years these guys have put out some bangers. Ronnie is a fucking genius. What he’s doing with his videos is fucking ridiculous. The quality and performance is top notch.
Wow, just wow!!!!!
Interesting how he's wearing cross earrings while being a vampire...
I've been saying it since I hopped on the Falling in Reverse train, Ronnie Radke is a modern Mozart. His talent in song writing, singing multiple styles including rapping, screaming, and just belting out notes with beautiful grace, and his ability to play piano.... He's a genius and highly misunderstood by critics. He is a true Master at his craft and loves his fans. The fact that he spends so much time interacting with his fans alone sets him in a whole other league than most frontmen. Mad respect, Ronnie, you are an inspiration.
Ronnie you bastard you did it again!
Ronnie: I am not a vampire  Me: So that was a fuckin lie
dude this is an other amazing song turned into a even more amazing song!
🐏goat
I Can’t stop watching this again and again 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Holy Fucking Shit that was amazing!
Paige💜💜
Please, tell us that you are a real life Vampire...
Гений мысли И ничего более
This doesn't just kick ass... It stomps it into hamburger.🔥🔥🔥
WOW. This is the content we want!  Thank you for putting so much effort into your creations. This was fucking incredible!   I want to see you in a series or something!!
Directors: Okay, so how dramatic should we make this? Ronnie: Yes
"I'm not a zombie but I feel like one" me every morning
Is this just gonna be a yearly thing where Ronnie remasters his old songs and turns them into some Phantom of the Opera type ordeal with the added bonus of rock?
Holy s*** I'm guessing this is Ronnie's idea this is perfect good job bro
Yoooo this could totally be a soundtrack for resident evil 8
I really wanna see this as a full on musical
The no tattoos thing was throwing me off until I realized what was going on lol
Falling in Reverse is on a whole other level..and Ronnie's abilities and creativity just keeps peaking higher and higher
i'm just like "woa"
When you tap on her shoulder then she turns around just to be Ronnie
Resident Evil Village
I've always thought ronnie was more of the werewolf asthetic, but I guess he's a vampire lol
Alucard, it is!
3:51 solidified this as my favorite musical/theatrical song-and-video of all time. Those vocals, that visual....fucking hell. All of this is perfect, also the bathtub scene right after this....11/10.
Honestly, how can someone dislike this?! It’s beyond me. Even if you don’t like this type of music, this is an absolute masterpiece. Ronnie Radke is what you call a true musician. He has so much style and absolutely nails everything he does. The man can sing, rap, scream, and act. I’ve been listening to Falling in Reverse for years now, and I can honestly say I have never heard anything so beautiful than this song. This and “The Drug In Me Is Reimagined” are unbelievable. The passion this man gives! You can see the emotion in his voice, it’s something you really don’t see often anymore. Ronnie Radke is a rare breed that must be protected at all cost. Great man, great band. RIP Derek Jones, he would be so proud of this ☺️🤘
GOD FREAKING DAMMIT !!! Suck me dry and call me mummy ! This is THE MASTERPIECE !!!😨😱😵 The orchestra , the choir,the atmosphere...HIS VOOOOICE !!! Hooooolly water !!!! Whaaaaat!?....  ... Like...  WHAAAAT !!??😵😲  And his demon voice transition in the middle of the song...a..and the screaming of last phrase !!!😧😮... I feel exhausted and full of energy at the same time !!!... ...*deep sign of eargasm* That.Is.Amazing.
AHHHHHHHHHH!
Literally not a damn soul: Ronnie: "Have yall seen Interview With A Vampire and Dark Shadows? Yea I want that and add some cloaked cult lookin people"
Fucking magnificent
Insane
wow
i knew it
this is just flat out one of the coolest fucking things i've ever seen. gimme a revamp/reimagined once a year and i'm gonna be a very happy human
Want more please
Meh
Falling In Reverse NEVER FAILS!!
He turned Paige. 🦇🖤🦇
Its Amazing
Whenever you feel like you need time for youeself to breathe, to heal, to simply be, you should allow yourself to take that time, my love. Your mind and body need the rest, the recharge, the stillness. And if you find yourself feeling guilty towards your loved ones for taking time away from them, remember: It doesn't mean that you love them less, it simply means that you are giving yourself permission to love yourself a little more. 🌼🌼🌼
Keep these comin!
https://youtu.be/W6YKZN0qkF8
That makes since now. You had fangs in The drug in me is reimagined. Good shit man.
Ronnie's voice is really shining through and showing his versatility in this song. His range,  power, rasp, scream, emotion... the man's got it all... Also,  does he not look a bit like Markus or Aro from Twilight?  Anywho, love this song, and everyone who reads this comment. Hope you have a good day!
F*CKN MASTER PIECE AGAIN!
*Hey, to you reading* .... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
Absolutely amazing 👏 This will go down as one of my favorite metal songs 🎵 Incredible range and raw emotion 👌 Love it 🖤
Holy F’in Damn! 🥰
Fuck that’s just cinematically and everythingly beautiful and just.... wow that hits hard in a good way.
Fuck. Ronnie. How have you not recieved all of the accolades you deserve. This is simply fucking sick. Entirely. I didn't even know how you could do it, but you did! Please do sink or swim!
Amazing! I already loved the original, but thiiisss, this is amazingly something else
Cuz im not even high and im getting full body goosebumps dude jesus this is amazing!!!!!!!
Love how his gf is in the video. Dude got the whole family working. Lol
Just What I Needed To Hear.
This was a banger and it isnt even a song its a movie like I’m listening to it on repeat nonstop like popular monster or drug in me is reimagined also Will there be a clean version of the song and future albums just asking pls don’t hate if not I’m just gonna have to learn to edit
RIP Derek
Baby paige ❤️
Wow..Both of the new Versions are amazing..I love the Originals but the Videos for these 2 new ones add so much more to the new Arrangements..Powerful and Moving indeed..
I'm saying it right now, I need a whole album like this. Falling In Reimagined!
Ronnie gave me another world
❤️❤️❤️
It's a movie guys
Paige
Very Beautiful 😍🖤  Question: Is that Ronnie his REAL hair or is it a wig???????
wow just wow
snape looks different
I need Game Over Redone XD
OMFG GOD I WAS HOPING FOR BADASS DRUMS IN THOSE HEAVY VOCALS OMG
WOAH!!! Just woah!
I've listened to this around 10 times today and everytime it gets better and the music video is just a cherry on top. The wardrobing is on point, Ronnie looks cool af the singing is on point and the story within the video is amazing. This is why I love fir
Dude is a musical genuis. A very rare talent.
я девушка солдата, я дождалась
Ficou perfeito 👏😍😍😍😍
Palaye royale, then Ronnie, who's next?  😭
When you were an emo kid and you grow up into a well refined goth adult
Que puto genio es Ronnie , eres el mejor tienes mucho talento y creatividad 🇨🇱🇨🇱 saludos.
Noicee do Friends and Alibis next!
RocKing never fails to deliver! 🔥
Paige 🔥🔥
My heart beats fast for his voice, my head thinks about how not to die with so much talent, they are my heroin overdose to be able to continue, I love each song they compose, a work of art.
chills
there are no words to describe how I felt after watching this
why i saw loki in this video?
this was fucking outstanding man!! - Also rest in peace to Derek🖤🤘🏻
This shit is actually beautiful 🤧❤️
Am I the only person that thought Ronnie looked like Ricky from MIW for like the first 3 secs?
Ronnie will make an entire Universe soon.
Rip Derek. 💔😪 Meet you in heaven.
Ronnie is so talented

Can you just please leave the actual good music in the past...
It’s just not the same without Derks solo rip to the king
Fuck man his singing is so perfected. I love the remakes of his older songs like this
Paige <3
this band is coming to and its been fun watching them grow play on your story has more to go ....
This is a masterpiece
I love this so much ! !  Beautiful theatrics. Just breath taking !! Another favorite
John 3:16-17 16. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. 17  For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen
Oh my god 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😍
Also like the wordplay- revamped
Yo this song is cool as hell 🖤
Ronnie can do no wrong
I though you were a werewolf ronnie
Wached this like 5 times now :)
If "The Drug in me reimagined" and this song is the direction Falling in reversed is taking, they got themselves a new fan in me, This is powerfull, Theatrical, well composed and performed with so much emotion, it's brilliant!
Couldn’t imagine a more powerful song from falling in reverse, yet Ronnie proved me wrong once again
#VimPelaSophia
3:28 He just went full black metal......I LOVE IT

I became/first heard of Falling in Reverse with Popular Monster, as quite a few did I'm sure... But damn this is impressive. Been a Huge fan since that day.
In loving memory of Derek Jones 😭😭😭  Ronnie with another masterpiece.
OMG I was waiting for him to remake this one too, I hope he redoes the whole album🖤🤘🏻
Oh my... this is PERFECTION

This is breathtakingly perfect. Ronnie you have knocked it out of the park holy crap
♥️
imagine a cross over with Blade of 1998
FUCK! IT'S AMAZING! I HAVE NO WORDS TO DESCRIBE MY FEELINGS!
Followed this band from teenage years to now being 25 going on 26. I'm an alcoholic and at first it was fun but now its not. And these remakes of the songs I used to love help to explain the madness I now live.
His range is nuts!!!
Had to create a new playlist titled “Mindblown” for this
The songs called im not a vampire but in the vid he is tf type of logic is that
EL VIDEOOOOOOO LOS VOCALSSS TODO TE AMOOOO
No puedo dejar de verlo!! Ame todo!!
these lyrics are strong af
Speechless! Love it, I really hope one day Ronnie you write a movie or play. Your so talented
IS RONNIE OK? yall I-   I never knew this is the remake I needed but now I now
AMAZING.. I LOVE FALLING IN REVERSE.. Ronnie is the most talented artist
THIS IS A MASTERPIECE
simplemente increible.
This man's vocal range is insane. He is so friggen talented and it blows my damn mind
whole lotte red
Caralho! Ficou simplesmente PERFEITO!
THIS IS FUCKING AWESOME
Man, it's just a part of me feeling proud of have born right on time to listen to this.🔥🤟🏻
First off, I didn't even think this was ronnie.... The effects n makeup are great! This music is amazing. Please be making a stage play or movie...
HOLY COW THATS PAIGE!
The creativity and visual imagery of this video was hauntingly soothing and beautiful, keep doing what you're doing Ronnie. Also Paige did an amazing job as well.
I feel like if any artist would read this it would be Ronnie. So if you do please continue to make these masterpieces. Beautiful.
Awesome redo! I'm really digging these remakes of your past songs!
Wow.
Paige should always be in his videos. Shes so beautiful and great acting. Also great pair. I love this song. I love his reimagened songs. Art pure art. Gotta become a film maker
Oh my god this was so good
Pure gosepump
I’m only here for PAIGE!!!! 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Omg 🤯😳
1:54 amd 3:50 literally made my heart drop, jaw drop, tear up, and instantly shared this video. Omfg 🖤🖤🖤☠🖤🌹🌹🖤 Shout out to a fellow vamp 👁 and Paige is so gorgeous oof 🖤🖤🖤
He needs 2 b a director. Also so passionate amd talented
PLEAASEEE MAKE A REVAMPED VERSION OF PICK UP THE PHONE PLEAASEEEE (im not a vampire - "revamped" tho lol)
What the fuck happened man. Fuck
Nice pun you got going on there😂
It's strange how metal fans have our acoustic side and we also like this kind of music. Anyway it's not that strange if I explain that it's because the thing that we (me at least) like the most about metal is not the metal itself, but the feeling it transmits (not sure if I said it well). And most of metal songs and these type of acoustic songs transmit sadness, anger, frustration or emotions like that. That's why we like this both types of songs
Well... holy shit, didn't see this coming.
Beyond epic...Ronnie Radke is the man.
Him having the long hair fits this perfectly
Rest In Peace Derek, you’re sorely missed🤧🤧🤧
AFI 10 years ago...
CARALHO QUE COISA LINDA
OMFG♥️
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Holy shit that was amazing 👏 👏👏
OH. MY. GOD. Wonderful.
Fucking phenomenal! I was just blown away. Cant wait for more
Goosebumps 🥺
welp, youve done it again Ronnie
Metal core , post hardcore good memories :(
YESSSS RONNIE! AMAZING!
Honestly feeling sick and watching this made me tear up. My heart ♥️
WHAT this is so beautiful
He turned one masterpiece into another!!
Okay but hear me out.... Queen of the damned revamped with Ronnie as lestat
I guess next mv gonna be " Raised By Wolves (Reborn)" or "Pick Up The Phone (Recall)"
For goodness sake. This is fucking art.
those screams sounded so insane, I felt so much emotion, so many goosebumps
So today is my 28th birthday (February 12) and I was feeling sad bc I didn’t get any birthday presents or anything and with only five minutes left of my birthday I came across this on my homepage. I’d like to say Thankyou Ronnie for saving my birthday and making it a happy day for me now 😊 best birthday present ever.
Fucking RonnieGod i love it
Yo wtf is this LOL
On a scale of one to even, I just can't.
Uff rolon  Paige y falling in reverse 🐸👌
Maaaaan it's so good
Мурашки. Как всегда. Ронни прекрасен!
This was a fuckin masterpiece
Love you Paige... And miss u lots
Dude this "new" style of redoing older songs from when i was in high school is so fucking awesome. Truly showing how talented of a singer he is. Phenomenal
That ending hit hard.....
Coming up: Drugs (clean version)
Ronnie & Paige look amazing!!!
💕🖤💕
Q desepcion -_-  y eso que escuchó su música desde tiempos inmemoriales
Omg I can’t get enough of it.... effing gold
*Holy Fuck*
This is what I wait for everyday
I love him
Falling In Reverse is following the path of Call Of Duty. Recreating his older versions 😂 Not that it's bad or anything. This sounds sick.
Elliot Page really took Vanya to the next level with this performance
I need you guys to pay me a new pants... fuck... awesome...
Holy shit!!! That was absolutely incredible the whole song gave me goosebumps and the cinematography was absolutely beautiful falling in reverse never disappoints!!! 🤘🤘🤘
Daaaamn it's like Danny Elfman and FIR's lovechild
That first few seconds reminds me of Ozzy.
here after love story (taylor's version)
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 🤘🤘✊✊  Epic. Absolutely epic sauce!
R.I.P. Derek
I'm here for Paige and no one else
this is awesome can't even explain the word for this holy crap
And he does it again 😁 good job Ronnie. The video production and the song kick ass
Amazing work
Love you bo! Rest In Peace Derek 🕊
A stunning work of art!🤩👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Absolutely amazing!
Paige 😍🤩💜💜💜
Well, damn!
So he is a vampire?
I fell in love with this new version it's very romantic and beautiful,I just fell in love <3 congratulations !!!!!
Falling In Reverse -"I'm Not A Vampire (The Zack Snyder Cut)" love it
Holy fuck that was so good going yo jail and being kicked out of escape the fate was the best thing to happen to him now look at him making so much music and better
Me encanta 🥰
I kept looking at his face and thinking that something looked really off, almost cgi about it and it took way too long for me to realize his tats were covered up
O brabo
chills dude, chills.
To be honest it was a bit cringe I'm sorry ronnie
In fear and faith v2?
Absolutely beautiful guys! I mean from the visuals to the new version of this song it is incredible! Keep kicking ass!
Не могу узнать Элину
look i knew ronnie was talented but this is just astonishing
Omg this is fucking art D:
I feel like I just watched a falling in reverse thriller movie, holy shit I feel like a vampire
Godamn mother fuckers this is fire from Lucifer himself. I can't even...fuck.
The best song of Ronnies career... absolutely AMAZING
Paige looks 😍....but this version of the song is awsome af🔥
If it wasnt solid before.. Which it was.. Ronnie is one of my all time idols and he just keeps proving how versatile he is with his music. The sheer ability he has to change the whole feeling of a song and convey it so you can feel that pain or excitement of it all is a great way to deal with everything from joy to depression. Redoing all the songs that were a staple for the band is a truly great way to honor derek.
Eh... it's okay. Then again, I don't listen to this band
Still not convinced...
I love FIR. Always have and will. But , lyrics don’t match melody. I don’t like this remix. Video is great!
It’s fine but popular monster was much better 🤷‍♂️ his voice is amazing but it's not like popular monster. Still support you fully I just like the last release much much more
I- i have words- like fuccccck 🖤
Wow! This is absolutely amazing!! The music is so intense and the video is so brilliant! PS: Paige looks absolutely stunning!!
I loved the fact that it looks like castlevania
Awesome job by Ronnie and the boys, but the screaming in the end part was a little to much for me.. loved it so much tho
FCKING INSANE
Please do Caught like a fly next.
RONNIE THE ONLY ARTIST IN THE WORLD SO FAR
Ok.... Your fans are loyal, even when a song obviously should have been left alone. This song is terrible because it seems like it was spun off of The Drug In Me Is You (reimagined) and it failed. The original version of Im Not A Vampire is amazing but this version is horrible because it tries to hard to play off the vampire theme. The Drug In Me Is You (reimagined) used the vampire theme in a very subtle way it was just perfect. That song has to completely different feels depending on the version. This song was fine the way it was. Idk.... Something is just not right with this version. Seems like Ronnie ran out of ideas and this is what he came up with. Just my opinion.
Ronnie showing off them vocals
Thanos kill Ronie
Ronnie x Paige. Best couple.
В очередной раз подтверждение - у Ронни огромный потенциал, талант так и прёт, особенно во всех последних синглах группы).
Haha get it reVAMPed :)
Fashionably late is next 👀
🔥
The original came out when I was in middle school. I am now a senior in college!!!! The insane nostalgia of this song makes me so damn emotional. Ronny is an absolute master! He was able to make me feel like I have never heard this song before and the pure artistry of the music video, vocals and instrumentals is STUNNING!!!!!
Loved the reimagined drug in me is you.  Love this vibe and video.. music is amazing . No harmonies that caught my ear
This is intense! This is gotta be the craziest musical ever! I love it 🔥🔥
What the fuck!!!.
As a pretty hard core Anne Rice fan, I love that this is like Interview with the Vampire 🖤
Epic
Fuck . . . I thought ‘’The Drug” reimagined was good, this just took it to a whole new level. Absolutely outstanding!
I'm crying
i dont often want a movie out of song videos but this one made me want one
Ronnie: and you thought i was angsty before?- bitch you aint seen nothing yet
FUCKING AMAZING
This is motherfucking INSANE. Holy motherfucking shit. I thought The Drug In Me Is Reimagined was nuts. This.... god DAMN dude. Ronnie wtf stop being so good.
This makes me feel pure bliss inside, my emo heart has been fulfilled yet again. Kudos for all these amazing years with these hits & blessings, gratefully not dead to be able to see this happen 😌
Holy crap this video is beautiful
Like it and the girl...damn
Ronnie Is a very great Artist
Fuckin dope
RONNIE IM LOSING MY FUCKING SHIT HERE
Can we talk about Paige’s “personalities”
FFS. Incredible isn’t a strong enough word.
R.I.P.   D.E.P.
Paige could play a modern Drusilla in a buffy reboot
Ugh why is Paige so damn gorgeous?!
Well 👏🏻 Fucking 👏🏻 Done 👏🏻 Ronnie 👏🏻
This is freaking awesome 👌
WHAT THE HELL DID I JUST WATCH??? LET ME TELL YOU IT WAS.........EPIC!  So So So So GOOD!
#18 TRENDING IN ECUADOR 🥺🖤
I love this song and this video so much
gotta say ill always love the first one more but this should be the opening to a musical cause damn
i thought the original was a bit cringy
Holy shit 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Well Ronnie did it again!
damn folks just went hard how long you been working on this?
This is absolutely beautiful
Jesus is coming back. Its time to get right with God! Time is running out. Money won't mean nothing, status won't absolutely mean nothing when we stand before the Lord. So many who died without Christ wish so bad they could repent and turn to Christ and receive his gift of salvation But they cant. It's too late. Dont be deceived God will not be mocked and you will stand judgement. Choose wisely. Eternity is FOREVER!
I LOVE THIS. My child emo self is screaming.
This gives me Meatloaf vibes
Mind blown. F'ing amazing - AGAIN.
Wow. I bow down to Ronnie. Such a beautiful and talented artist.
im just wondering who the freak this is- this cant be ronnie i didnt know he could get his voice to go opera like this
Movie quality, wow 👏
they must've got hit by 2020 cause they got this sad mood now XD
to be honest, now i wanna see alone in this version 🔥🔥
Holy... what a masterpiece
damn dafunk i thought theese dudes were gone and they come back with this ok i see you *looking around*
Over the top cheesy AWESOME!!! I got goosebumps watching this. So over the top and great fun!!!
What a fuckin masterpiece!!!
Ronnie the musical please, seriouslyyyy.
iloveyou both paige and ronnie <3
Рони выпускает что то Я: очередной ремейк Так же я в слезах: Как же это было офигенно!!!
ya no es lo mismo de antes
I LOVE THE SCREAMS BABY
Let's go!!!
Ronnie is a prophet. He said our minds would be blown.  Yep.  Mind. Fucking. Blown. 😊
OMG I LOVE THIS VIDEO!!!! I've been waiting for months to finally hear this song and it was definitely worth the wait! I am hoping the rumors are true and he is doing an entire album of only revamped songs. Ronnie's music reaches my soul more than any other artist. He knows how I feel and how to put it into words. Cant wait to hear more music!!!!
I see what you did there
question to straight (dudes): how can yu be straight seeing this XD
Ronnie looks so weird without tattoos.
You can say what you want about Ronnie but he doesn't half know how to make a piece of music.  This was simply phenomenal.
*FiR on the drug in me is reimagined* "i'll fuckin do it again"
I swear I get goosebumps every time I hear a new song! Even if it's the old song redone! It's so amazing what he does with everything...ugh words man all the words...
Okay okay, I accept, I became a fan
Amazing performance.
Rise by the wolves (Rewolved)
What's sad, but also awesome, Ronnie's videos are better than alot of movies released lately. There should be an award show for great music, but there isn't.  Only for crappy ass music. Ronnie is a musical genius.
Faaaaan
Who’s here because of Paige’s post ?🙌🏻
I don't think Snape took Lily's death very well
Ronnie is everything Edward Cullen could never be 😩
This is why we love him, true artist right here 👏 🙌 ❤ 💜
God, I'm speechless
OMGOMGOGM YES
I Love yall to end of time💯❤
When Professor Snape became emo:
that makeup covers up his face tattoos WELL
So many hidden secrets DAMN Ronnie why you do this to us??? 🖤🤘🖤🤘🖤🤘🖤
Wow this is awesome! This is where he has been hiding the past few months. Hope all is well Ronnie and I hope you are coping well with the loss of your guitarist.
lets go its trending!!!
https://youtu.be/H3JrdCtB7Rk
Wow! Big thumbs up!
Don't get me wrong..... I love the original but........ I FUCKING LOVE THIS VERSION SO MUCH MORE! OMG! 😱😍🤘🏻🖤🦇🧛🏻‍♀️
He is on with his emotional power and expression. A true artist
This is like a badass movie and I love it!
He said it best "You wanna call me the King of the music scene iv'e got news for you I'm the GOD of it!!!!
Hard to believe that the last one was them in rehab
I yelled
I really love how Falling In Reverse preserved Jacky's solo into piano/strings
Raised By Wolves (reraised)???
WOW!!!! Just WOW!!!! Fucking brilliant!
This is so cool. Dark,yet beautiful.
Puts me in a payale Royale mood
Holy shit!
I can’t wait for Goodbye Graceful
issat makeup or are all of ronnies tats gone?
Oh my good I'm dead
love it
Thank you
A MASTERPIECE
wtf i was like wtf       xd
Wow
This is one of the greatest creations ever. Incredible work of art. Extreme passion. Brilliant story telling. Phenomenal singing. Dynamic orchestra sounds. The melodies really grab you. Ronnie is an amazing artist. Paige did amazing too!! Wow! Brilliant. Just brilliant.   Thank you for this!!!!
LITCHERALLY GAVE ME THRILLS BRO AAAAAAAAAA WTF
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Incredible 💫
R.I.P - DEREK JONES 🖤
this guy is so fucking TALENTED
Brendon Urie has some competition
He could be Loki's brother
Lol
like dude...you look so different without the tats...mogged me out for a bit, trying to figure tf was different
Unholy Shit.
Is that Paige from wwe?
I fucking Love this!!! Feels like if was written by Shakespeare now
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Whoever did Ronnie's makeup did him dirty, homie needs some chapstick 😭😭
These two songs have got to be a teaser are they gonna drop the whole album again
Falling in reverse needs to do this more
This sounds way better than the original 😍😍
Epic shit.. this my second time listening and it has me in tears
Falling In Theater is their new name i guess. This shiii is FIRE!
Wow this is a fucking masterpiece
lançou mais uma braba
I'm here baby🔥
*i freakin love paige*
Sir, you dropped something. Let me give it to you !🤲🏻👑
Amazing song and video.
0:43 Eren Jaeger Final season..🙃
OMG He is awesome anyone agree
Amazingggg ❤️ , just too good 🔥🔥🔥
🖤🖤🖤
Wow
I loved “the drug in me is reimagined “ but this one is better. Keep it up. Can’t wait to see what other song you redo in this same style🤘🏻
A++ drama factor
Beautiful ...absolutely beautiful
Beautifully done
Amo la letra de la canción, pero si e de decir que me cuesta aceptar la adaptación....me gustaba mucho la versión anterior aunque wow con la fotografía de el vídeo!!!!! I love Ronnie !!! Aunque ni lo va a leer ni entiende español creo.
HOLY FUCK! Aye Ronnie is the GOAT! This was a movie, and a phenomenal one. The vocals, the music arrangement? Absolutely breathtaking. Paige looked positively stunning. I don't even have enough words for how DOPE that was. It can't be quantified. The more hate Ronnie gets, the more fire music we get from him. Go head with your bad self!
One could say Re-vamped
It'll grow on me
Damnit, I really thought he was going to fight them all in the style of popular monster... a little let down, but over it, still a great one!
I prefer the old one 100000/10 on the old one 800/10 on this one
Wwwwwooooooooooowwwwwwwwwww
Mom: why don’t you go outside? Me: 5:05
Uh, nobody is gonna say how fucking gorgeous Paige looks. 🥰  This is also the most beautiful video I've ever seen.
Look at Paige though!
The make up is amazing. Can't even see any of his tatts
Может пора что-то новое уже написать?
''Hi My name is Ronnie, I'm an actor''
.
Fuck.. I officially got old, this was total whiny shit to my ears.
Dude omfg this was amazing
damn Ronnie can sing  like holy shit
The Ronnie Radke Diaries 🖤
I swear Paige is an actual goddess 😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥
Thank you so much Ronnie!!
Daaaammmnnn!!🔥🔥🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶
Ronnie 😍
Saraya Jade is very beautiful. 🤩🖤
I'm confused. Are you or are you not a vampire?
I wish there was a way to know how many people said “Wow” at the very end. Incredible..
if they ever remake or do any of the Lestat movies, you need to audition!!!
I'll say it once more but god this is actually so perfect. Like, i get it, it's only a ''revamped'' version of it. But nono my boi. It's entirelly something new. Im not sure what's this guy is on when he's doing his music but i want it and i want more
Wow, they released a musical
What a great voice! I love this video, Paige is hauntingly beautiful,  this video is special. 💞
🌿🌿🌿🌿Thanks! 🎵🎼🎹🎹💚💯❗🤗 .💋💋💋💋💋💞💞💞💞   My favorite channel💕😢,really!Thanks for the video.💋💋💋💋💋💞💞💞💞   🚀🚀🚀 Very nice video 👍👍🚀🚀🚀Very charming
This is Much better than the original, i Imagine that whole old song, release like this..
Ronnie looks good tattooless, looks like a young Peter Steele or Glenn Danzig!
Holly fucking whaaat its so good i want one album completly like that
I'm literally in awe!!!!! No words can describe what I'm feeling right now.
holy fucking shit. this is gold
😱😱😱😱 That was mind blowing and amazing. Paige has been my favorite female wrestler/ anti-diva. She was amazing and Ronnie I am convinced he is a vampire 🦇🦇🦇. Sorry my mind is blown. 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
my fir concert was a year ago today, the first time he played the drug in me is reimagined NOW EXACTLY A YEAR LATER THIS??? RONNIEEEE
Can other bands start doing this too, just full orchestral cinematic re-imaginations of their song, this is the kind of trend I need in my life
Such horrible voice 😂
The vocals, the screaming, paige in all her beauty, the choir and the cinematics! it's just *chef's kiss* beautiful!
My music will blow up this year!🙏🏽💙
This song>>>literally everything else in the world
Omg... This is SO powerful and moving. This brought me to knees crying. Truly another gold record for Ronnie. Amazing and so beautiful 😍 ❤ 💖
The sound gives me mad crown the empire and black veil brides vibes but Ronnie's voice doesn't compliment this style well. On the whole its meh at best
Yet again Ronnie you have made another phenomenal video and another outstanding revamped song! I am utterly blessed to be your fan! Keep doing what you are doing! You are a king in your own right!!! Much love! Stay safe and healthy!
The second one he's now changed to a classical, beautiful song from upbeat. Now I can listen to this on blast without it being deemed ruckus by my mom :)
Holy shit! JUST WOW😍
You're so underrated. You deserve more recognition, your talent is incredible I love your voice so much
MOVING
If this master piece isn't song of the year..then...MY HEART HAS LOST ALL HOPE!.
Never heard of this guy (group) before and this is a fucking 🔥
Paige 🤩
Mano eu não acredito que eu só fui conhecer Falling in reverse esse ano mano, Ronnie é perfeito demais pqp
holy hsit ronnie, so powerful
PLEASE BE THE FATHER OF MY KIDS!!!!!!
Spoilers.....                 Awwwe I didnt want them to die at the end. Very beautiful reimagining. I need more.
Bravo! 🧛🌕⚰️
Epic..
HOLY FUCKING FUCK, A TEAR DROPPED FROM MY EYE THIS IS BEAUTIFUL
Now im waiting on “pick up the phone” remake
Holy ..... that was amazing
Holy shit!! Finally!!! Another amazing release from Ronnie!!! Fuck yes!!! Love it! Also, thank you for switching it up with the revamped songs lately. Well done!
Perfect song for Valentine Day
Oh god i love it
God damn Ronnie is a legend
Falling In Reverse on trending?!    The world is truly healing! 🙏🙏🙏 🥇🥇🥇
really fucking awesome, love all falling in reverse´s songs :D
F*ck you Ronnie. Why do you always have to give me chills and play with my emotions. Absolutely great revamp of the song. Paige was amazing as well. Great music and perfect video. Well f*ucking done my dude. 💪💪💪🙃
chill
Carajo, casi lloro🤣🤣🤣♥️♥️🔥🔥🔥
Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
Blown away <3
PAIGE 🖤
Whoa I randomly searched the original version and found this. It's awesome! Such a different vibe
Panic! in reverse.
This is honestly just a masterpiece. In absolute awe with this, hoping the rest of the album gets redone into this sort of style.
Can you make another song ?
Que asco de musica
Lmao at this point why Ronnie lololol
Any time Ronnie does remakes of his older songs like this, he really shows just how versatile he can be & just how talented he is. The control he has over his voice is honestly impressive.
https://youtu.be/f_qD0OlgIgY
FIR makes an amazing acoustic version, just like the previous I See Stars did
Absolutely FUCKING AMAZING....  I love the fact there's no limits on genre, no idea what you're going to get, but fabulous every time!  I didn't really like the early FIR stuff, and this just doing covers of earlier songs in a new way is just amazing!
Ronnie's voice is just beyond amazing. Could listen to a whole album of these revamped songs.
Wow the song went up and down so much that was strange for sure
Okay Ronnie needs to make a movie.
Simply powerful and a cinematic masterpiece.
I swear this man's voice just keeps getting more and more beautiful
Oh my gosh... I effing LOVE this.  When I first saw "The Drug In Me Is You Reimagined", I thought how awesome it would be to see my favorite FIR song reimagined.  You FREAKING nailed it Ronnie and your pedestal has been raised even higher.  You are brilliant beyond words!  HUGS, Pamikins
I see Paige in there!!
Woooow Fucking amazing Ronie!!! Didn't knew you where a power balad type of guy, fucking incredible!
Buena voz, buenos efectos, buen vídeo, buena actuación: Ronnie Radke
Are we not gonna talk about how much Saraya (Paige off WWE) looks in this music video? Stunning as ever
Extraordinary! great voice ... Ronnie is still Ronnie ... This new version is equal to or even better than the original version.
Could they possibly do the same with “raised by wolves” who knows
Holy shit Goose bumps man, Haven't heard this side of Ronnie in a long while!
Why is vampire ronnie so damn attractive tho ... and omg his voice it's amazing its ... just breathtaking ah
Absolutely fking epic... Keep em coming sir
Look like my last girlfriend
Hey Ronnie. U disappeared for quite a while and now u are here to bring your new work. Wow..just love it ❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥
I love this song more then anything especially this version
Can't wait for "Good Girls Bad Guys"
[Verse 1] Well, I'm not a vampire, but I feel like one Sometimes I sleep all day because I hate the sunlight My hands are always shaking, body's always aching, and the dark is when I feed Well, I can lure any woman that I want to in my bed with me.  [Pre-Chorus] And whiskey seems to be my holy water Mothers, better lock your doors and hide your daughters  [Chorus] I'm insane, well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold? For goodness sake's, where is my self-control? If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all hope  [Verse 2] Well, I'm not a zombie, but I feel like one today Self-induced comatose, chemical daze My head is always spinning from this dizzy blurry vision and my stomach has had enough I feel like a lady that is pregnant with a baby 'cause I'm always throwing up  [Pre-Chorus] Hi, my name is Ronnie, I'm an addict Daddy should've never raised me on Black Sabbath   [Chorus] I'm insane, well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold? For goodness sake's, where is my self-control? If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all hope  [Guitar Solo]  [Bridge] God bless all of you now 'Cause I'm going straight to hell And I'm taking you down with me 'Cause you know damn well  [Chorus] I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold? I'm insane, well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold? For goodness sake's, where is my self-control? If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all hope, all hope
Holy fuck, i just shat myself
This man must be a genius because this is a MASTERPIECE, so beautifully done.
I love this!!!
Better than twilight story
🖤❤🖤❤ So pretty!! I love how they remember Derek 🖤❤🖤❤
Well that escalated quickly
Oh my god oh my god I am totally not freaking out right now I been waiting for this
Edward from Twilight if he could sing godly

Chills. Who would have imagined you could revamp I'm not a Vampire into this. Fucking incredible.
I loved it! ☺💜👍
Ножечкин конечно тоже дал джазу. Клип топовый

God that was awesome!!!!!!
i like this video before i watch it Thx Ronnie i love u
Paige 😍
Absolutely love seeing Paige here.
Ok now he’s really just showing off his musical abilities, his voice has grown so much over the years, his control and range are absolutely amazing. I did have to do a double take with the whole no tats thing but everything about this is pure magic. Thank you for breathing this into existence Ronnie!
Holy shit
Damn
He has always had one hell of a voice
first time hearing this band and i can fawk with this
Awesome
Feels like I just watched a full on movie and I ABSOLUTELY LOVED it!
Speechless. Phenomenal...
Holy fuck man just gets better and better
Rest in Piece Derek and thank you for the wonderful music that has gotten many of us through our toughest times. I send my condolences
Ronnie completed the game hes just finishing side quests at this point.
The 13 y/o emo girl inside me is screaming
Absolute genius.
I love this
Y acá estamos, escuchando esto 😊🤩👍
Can you say "Vampirian Rhapsody" *badoompching* (Get it like :"Bohemian Rhapsody"😅)
You should be leading mainstream charts, not just rock charts, FUCKING GENIUS
Holy shit this is good
Holy shit, thats all i have to say
This is crazy good, and the video is better than any vampire  movie ever made lol
Liked cus i appreciate the love u put in this
FREAKING FIRE. This song. Is. Brilliant. Bravo.
I feel like based on the lyrics a reimagened version doesn't work
OMG!!! This is so amazing!
Nobody: Ronnie:so have y'all seen interview with a vampire
He's definitely gotten better as he goes and this is proof
Vampire wrestler! Here comes the Fang! 1...2...3
OHH MY FUCKKINNGGG GOOODDD IM NOT PLAYING WHEN I SEE THATD THE MOST INCREDIBLE THING IVE EVER SEEN
WHAT THE FUCK WAS THIS
This has no reason being this good.
not one of there good songs it not bad but it not good too its in the middle
God the vocals are incredible in this! 🖤 I would love to hear how pick up the phone would sound reimagined as well. Amazing job to the band and the people who helped with the making of the video as well just simply amazing
holy shet! how amazing is this? 💯🔥
Девачки, прастите, я снова плачу😭😭😭😭          Шучу, очень мощная песня, звучит эпично и воодушевляюще, очень рад видеть русскоязычные  коменты в топе, наконец-то у нас хоть немного людей узнали о FIR!
3:50 FUCKING SING MY BOYYY - WOW
I swear to God Ronnie Radke is super human!
Dude you can really make any song sound so good in any way love this
This is fucking fire.
I like how each reimagined or revamped song gets a fantastic music video that really REALLY sets the tone/emotion of the song.
Let me know when Ronnie makes a full on rock opera, I'd pay good money for that. I'm digging these reimagined/revamped singles.
This is so beautiful I don't know what to do with myself now  That's a lie I'm in the mood for vampire stuff lmao
Epic. I miss the old sounds but this is just great. I don't want to admit it's better than the original, but it probably is.
is that paige???
Fucking yes!!!!!!!
OH MY FUCKKING GOD RONNIE
ReVAMPED definitely an appropriate way to describe the song 🤘🏽
I can't wait to hear Raised by Wolves (Rewolved)
Uff increhiblee se me pus la piel chinita,buena música
vampire? zombie? hmm I feel Resident Evil Village vibe here
Ronnie + piano = New old perfect song ♥️
Jesus christ, another amazing revamp by Ronnie! Rest in peace Derek.
Just epic! ❤️🤘 Can't get enough
Fucking hell wow I love it 😍😍😍
I swear I almost shed a tear. This is beautiful.
Brandon Urie: Ohh Ronnie your taking the path of aristocratic. Well done.
Yes this is what I wanted
PURE talent <3
🧛🏻‍♀️❤
Damn had i known this is what the video was gonna be i would of made some popcorn!
The amount of pure control and range that this man has while making this into a genius piece of theatrical art really shows that Ronnie is a true force to be reckoned with.
Looks like Ronnie was influenced by In Fear and Faith’s “symphonies”. Great rendition of I’m not a vampire btw 🤘🏽
Paige 😍, This was very beautiful to watch. The emotion in the music, ronnie’s voice is beautiful.. .  The story. Felt like I was watching a movie honestly. I love this version as well as the original. Love this !!!
This is rad as hell
Absolutely fucking incredible, as if I expected any less. I've followed Ronnie and his bands for nearly a decade and a half now, and he only seems to get better and better, while simultaneously sticking to his personal sound. I can't get enough of this why why why
WHAT THE FUCK WAS THIS
R.I.P . adding this to the songs I love from Ronnie and falling in reverse. so all of them.
ronnie is everything okay
Somehow this gave me „Phantom of the opera“ vibes (in a good way)
Omyghadd!!! Goosebumps!!!!
Is this really ronnie? Man this is like a Movie!
Holy. Shit. This is amazing.
Amazing! The new lyric part makes it even better 👍 ...and those visuals 🔥
You saying your not a vampire makes me think you lowkey are
Ya  saquen el album hijos de la vrg....
Now I get the fangs in reimagined 👹😱WHAT THE HELL DID I JUST WATCH? My God I’m still shaking from this. It wasn’t just a video , it was a experience. Telling 2 stories at once, The one about how he has been dealing with the grief and depression anger etc.. of losing Derek just rips your heart out. This is Beethoven meets young Meatloaf meets Eminem’s “Darkness” plus his own heart. just incredible..😱😱😱😱🥺🥺❤️❤️❤️
Ronnie please keep on doing this. Your voice has progressed so much over the years. I can feel your words now instead of hearing them. I love getting chills and your delivery just hits so deep.  Thank you for being so fucking creative.
WOW.
God damn 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wow. There are no words to describe what an incredible talent Ronnie Radke is. I am not disappointed. EVER. Radke is a genius in every meaning of the word.
I’d love to hear a Don’t Mess With Ouija Boards (Revisited)
I love everything about this music video, goths rise up!
Are we all going to ignore the fact that Ronnie is killing the fucking game right now?
this was literally a whole cinematic experience o.o
Idk I love TDIMIR and trust me there isn't many others who are a bigger fan of this band then I. With that said Idk how I feel about this... I just feel like the emotion the first one had isn't there. Maybe I just need to listen a few more times idk. Anyone else have any thoughts?
This man is good at everything he does
revamped...hahaha nice one =P
🖤 *PAIGE* 🖤
I really like how you guys tell stories!
I love this but why did you have to make it sound so good? My mom plays the drug in me is reimagined on loop now she definitely gonna loop this one too.
Omg r.i.p Derek!!! That made me 😢
Absolutely epic I loved everything about this from song, visuals, production, and just everything. Music has gotten away from production. This was a masterpiece! I appreciate ya!
I fucking called this last time. He had vampire teeth lol
Holy hell man. I'm speechless. Had to sit in silence for a minute after that masterpiece. 👏👏👏👏
so he is a vampire and a popular monster
SICK !!!!!! Paige is so beautiful 😍
Lookin like Bram Stoker’s Dracula 🧛🏻‍♀️
Minha Banda Favorita 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
an artwork
So amazing!!!
I was like "somethign looks wird on Ronnie" then I realized the tatto thing lmao
RIP Derek jones one of the best guitarists of our time 🙏
The video is so coollllllllll.
This was sp fucking beautiful 🥲
Honestly the best screaming Ronnie has ever done...
This is emo af. I knew you still had it in you Ronnie.
Just horrible the original was better
This is fantastic. Hope you do more videos like this.  Incredible.
Ronnie is a pure artist! Damn this was good
This is so awesome🔥🔥🎧🎧🖤🖤
This was the best thing to wake up to
Awesome just totally awesome.
Cadê os br? )0)
Amei
Goosebumps literal goosebumps
but dude 👀... vampires😳
This man is an artist
I don't know if more people noticed it but this song on Spotify is 6:16 minutes long. Lol.
Falling in Reverse being #19 on trending like ...You'Re sTill HEre???
GREAT to see Ronnie and Paige but this song pours a lot of emotions! Hope to hear a musical remake of the 1st album! 😁👌
Damn Ronnie!! Hard to top your last few drops but this is at least as good if not better! Love it man
What a pieceeee!!!!
I Live for this weird shit 🦇
not the original popping up under this 😭😭😭
Can there just be a whole album of this
Now I want to watch all the vampire movies. Well done!!
I giggled at “revamped” lol
This was incredible. But I wouldn’t expect anything less. This mans creativity knows no bounds
Yooooo it's here
Ronnie is truly the most talented modern frontman.
the end has me , fuck
*omg paige!*
He could sing with Brandon urie . I like all your guy's songs and story line.  Also this one should be in movie. And a beautiful voice and piano skills. Every time I watch the ending I almost cry
Did ANYBODY ever stress out his talent as an actor?! He is amazing! So on point with his performance! Name a vid - any! I dare you! He even manged to copy Johnny Depp's running part  in "dark shadows" when he is running up to the rocks! This is mindblowing
Is it normal to experience shivers, chills and goosebumps while listening to music? I only experience it from this band
I watched this, then immediately watched it again. Ronnie is so beautiful as a vampire lol
Ok so like its great but like, **I can't handle not hearing super emo guitars blaring**
In the end he didn't sparkle <3
Paige❤️Ronnie
It hit so damn hard on my bones. I never loved rapish songs but I was always interested by his mucic style but now my Emo/Metal teenagers want to start over with those type of songs. My heart is aching  again💔
Epic
The initial melody reminds me of Deathstars' Chertograd
From a werewolf to a vampire real quick!
Well, this was simply fucking incredible. Ronnie proving once again he is unstoppable.
create another one like popular monster
The chic in the white dress is Paige from the wwe. I’m into hip hop myself & don’t usually listen to rock but I’ll admit that was a cool video & song 💯
thx
my children will watch this and i will be able to say that i saw it right as it came out
just here for paige just wow very beautiful .......the song not so much well the beat is fine but the vampish stuff i like .....im into horror
Now this is pure fucking art. Ronnie's voice is better than ever.
That was a fucking masterpiece.  This isnt my jam normally but they are on another level now.  If they dont do a full orchestral gig at royal albert or something its a missed opportunity
damn bro the detail of the pale lips and red tongue musical and visual masterpiece
But why
They should make a playlist of the most popular songs make them like this slow and then different beats and great music videos! Plus a huge spike in sale production if they made  new merch based off of the new music and themes.
I am not Vampire, but i am popular monster.
A genius
GOD DAMN MAN
DUDE IM LOSING MY SHIT RIGHT NOW HOLY FUCK
Is there no limit to Ronnie's talent!? Bro keep doing your sh*t!! 🤘😝
You're not a vampire but you look gorgeous as one. Lol.
Cinematicore, love it
It's gonna blow!!
Me encantó!!!!
Holy fucking shit
Is this The Room?
Leigh Hurley - F  Thomas Cleaves - M
love it
lasted 45sec, cant stand it.
Is there anything Ronnie can’t musically do? Nope, not a fucking thing! ❤️❤️
Greetings from Colombia🖤🇨🇴
AMO, ME ENCANTA !
i have never been in more love with a music video in my life....wow
Is this Sarayas first cameo in one of his music vids?
Yes this was awesome Ronnie did a great job with this and Paige ! It was very theaterical and it made me like the song so much more than the oringal ! It had lots of emotion in it which made the video so much better and I loved the whole video !This video fits more with the words and meaning of the song than the oringal video and it had that interview with the vampire feel to it . Def digging this and I bet the 2 rocking grannies with do a great review on this !!!
Falling in reverse killed it again. 🔥🔥🔥
Im so disappointed not good
I am speechless. This was so mental!
My favorite song remade into another fucking master piece
Ronnie Radke is a musical genius!
When words fail, music speaks.
I don’t like that Paige is in this
this guys is so fire, love you falling in reverse
Absolutely amazing, his vocals really compliment this different style. I hope he does more like this.
Mori...💀🖤
Greatest vampire movie ever!!! Fucking awesome!!!!
Ronnie kinda looks like Ricky Olson from MIW in this video
YES
This is how you kill it.
Nooooo!
Holy Shit I thought the song Revamped was amazing, but the video makes it even better ! Especially with the choir being hooded and on a cliff, everything fit so well !
Uffff 🖤 magnífico 🖤😎
BIG interview with the vampire vibes here!!
This was so damn intense! I love how this dude takes a fun rocking song from the old days and turns it into an intense masterpiece.
Hey who's cutting onions
Beautiful
How can I like this more than once? It deserves it. Masterpiece
Bruh
I understand where he went with this and appreciate the fact he renewed a classic, but I personally enjoy the original. Not to say I don't enjoy this, because Ronnie is always amazing.
Im so happy paige is in the video (:
The most amazing notification of my day
Next: Pick Up The Phone "(Redialled)"
Ronnnnnnieeee!!! Omg! You were right, it was worth waiting for. That shit was epic 🥰
Um...... who is the beautiful goddess in the video?
Okay, another masterclass, and i'm sincerly thanking you for that. That's beautifu andl I litteraly can't wait your next re imagined song in this orchestral way (maybe Alone ?!) Thanks to all people who works on that
OMFG
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Rhonnie without tattoos is the real haunt here.
MAN OH MAN ANOTHER ONE!!!
I know this is your video but SARAYA!! 😍😍😫😫😭😭😭
Very, very, very impressive.
this sounds magestic
All I can say is, YES, thank you for existing.
He keeps doing it!! Love this guy he’s my role model!
Just....... Fucking ....... Mind blowing...... We cant exoect better, and they give us better ......... amazing
I'm convinced he's writing Falling In Reverse: The Musical.
¡Holly Fucking Shit! This makes me cry 💖
Aaand the man outdoes himself yet again.
re-situationed
It’s like a mixture between Evanescence’s newer content and Woodkid.
welp, that was impressive!!! batting a thousand there ronnie!!
Beautiful and inspiring 😍❤️
going to go cry rn
Garbage song
Cooool af
no fucking way :D:D
This is just a thought but what if Ronnie is preparing a whole album of reimagined tracks some of the biggest Falling in Reverse hits and as he releases some in the all single road behind the scenes he is working on a bunch of other songs just a thought
Love the song and the cinematography, FIR never disappoints :)
Love that The Drug In Me Is Reimagined’s video was Edward Scissorhands and this one is totally Interview With a Vampire
Loved the theatrics throughout this video...well done
Absolutely love this. Just when you think Ronnie did amazing with the drug in me reimagined he goes up and beyond. Adore this guy hes my hero 💖 x
ПРОСТО невероятно КРУТО. Это наверно лучший КЛИП
And the legend has done it again. Ronnie is a king
I love it!
Next good gilrs BAD guys
Feckin dooooooooope
Wow.
This is awsome but I keep hearing the original lol
When are we seeing this on Broadway. Amazing!!!
Am I stupid or is this the same house that tonight is the night I die by palaye royale music video was filmed in
Amazing piece of work and vocals!!! Bravo!!
I hope we get a "Goodbye Graceful re-graced" one day.
Straight Fire as Always Ronnie!! Those Keys & Strings tho!! 🤘🔥🔥🤘🔥🔥🤘
He should do a reimagined version of caught in a fly but like a distorted carnival with a broken music box in the background
Haha revamped ronnie you clever boy
Beautifully done!
The missing tattoos is a trip
Holy Shit ♡♡♡
love your music always have, enjoyed your revamped <3
HES DONE IT AGAIN GUYS❤️👏🏻
I'm happy he put Paige in a video
OMG. Fucking masterpiece
Well time to wait for all the React videos then Ronnie Reacts
Masterpiece! I can't stop listening and watching it.
And nobody realized he added a whole new verse???
This is so awesome.  Now we need raised by wolves or don’t mess with ouija boards reimagined.  Honestly there’s so many.
If they play this live, it's gonna cause an earthquake from all the people getting goosebumps in the crowd
this girl is paige?
WOW!!! this is a whole movie absolutely love it
That shit was amazing!! Love your reimagined songs!! Well all your songs, but especially these
wowahhh...  :)
Hi Paige!!
Just pulls on your heart strings a little
Falling in Reverse’s  movie is gonna be amazing
Yoo this is so fricken good
Is the same mansion as in "Tonight is the night I die" from Palaye Royale (they are also vampires in teh video) so I can't love more this song. TYSM Ronnie and Epitaph and RIP Derek...
And the new album
Holy fucking shit this was beyond amazing, Falling In Reverse/Ronnie have done it again, 10/10.
3:52 is my favorite vocal from this song 😍
Holy shit.
literally getting chills down my spine, when bands do reimagined songs its nothing too special but falling in reverse takes it to another level
🐐
Wow love this! Especially being an Anne Rice fan Interview with a Vampire was everything. I remember him saying in a live stream he should have had a choir for The Drug in Me reimagined, the choir in this was awesome. It's so cute Paige is in a video she looks amazing.
Falling In Reverse has blown me away yet again with another BEAUTIFUL rendition of one of their classic songs!!
Que buen video ctm
Can’t get enough of this!! ❤️👌🏻
Well... gotta add this one to my bucketlist once i order a microphone. Both vertions are amazing but they feel like 2 different songs <3
Hell yeah... Here comes another one
Pelo amor de Deus que música sensacional
Gold. That's it.
LO AMO
Holy hell full body goosebumps
Holy shit.. I haven't listened to their newer stuff until today with this song. Holy shit. I'm so.. Surprised. This is actually really good.
Derek jones,we miss you:((
Bra-freaking-vo. Ronnie's raw passion cannot be matched. With each lyric he sings I feel it coursing through my veins.
a six minute eargasm is what it is.
This is the most beautiful thing I’ve ever heard
sooooooo......same time in 2022 right guys?
FUCK. I AM IN AWE.
This is the epitome of going from an edgy emo teen to a refined goth adult
wow
OMG THIS IS SO GOOD I CANT- SICJSKFDJFJS
Put Ronnie in a Disney singing film
bro- this has saved 2021
Holy shit this is really good I love this song so much
Fan-freaking-tastic!! So very awesome. Ronnie you are a genius!!! Paige is gorgeous!
Also, REST IN PARADISE DEREK 🖤
Awesome 😃  Reminds me a little bit of avenged sevenfold "a little peace of heaven"
As cool as this is, I feel like it detracts from the drug in me is Reimagined. Don't get me wrong it's awesome.
I love both of this version and the original song 😊👍
am i late ?
I love how Ronnies music keeps changing in the same way my taste in music changes
Ronnie's next stop...Broadway.
my wattpad story came to life
Wow. I’m lost for words  Just wow
This was amazing and i see you added the choir you wanted.
Holy shit... Rest In Peace Derek Jones, I’ll truly never forget that you were one of my favorite guitarist that was in the band. 💔
Can we get a vampire movie with Ronnie Radke & Remington Leith like seriously they both look awesome as vampires
Ronnie radke never disappoints, fuck music too much!♥
Paige ;)
okay but i wasn't expecting THAT
When a young emo boy turns into a grown goth man, magic happens.
When I read the final writing, I almost started to cry. I listened to this band til the "Just like you" era, but they remind me of an important phase of my life and I can't believe Derek is gone 💔 I remember the day I read Ronnie's post like it was yesterday.
that was a rollercoaster
YOU CAN REALLY SEE WILLOW AND RONNIES RESEMBLANCE in this video wow they are twins I love that daddy's girls always look like their dad it's true
This song need god damn Oscar so many emotions at once fantastic song.
Love it he can do so much with his voice
So this was the trailer to a Ronnie Radke lead vampire tv series right? Cause if not...let’s get to work on it.
Fuckin hell dude kill it
Ronnie very bad actor
Another masterpiece! I hope this means the whole album is getting this treatment!
Better love story than twilight
3:26-3:40 the i swear to God please 😭
I like this 👍🤟👿🤟
I am getting Dark Shadows Vibes from this
This is one of the best Vampires movies
2:03-2:44 some movie theater shit
Wow.. That note at the end? I had no idea he could hit that note!
my god this is beautiful
Still better than Twilight 🤣 A true masterpiece and we'll always love Derek💔
He’s on track to win an Academy award and a Grammy with this one! Amazing Ron <3
Fuckin epic
This is a whole movie ♡o♡ I love it, this is amazing and so intense xD
It's fucking epic
Beautifully orchestrated
Ronnie is a true artist.
Edward who???
5:44 that note omfg I have goosebumps 👏🏻😧
Wow! Awesome!!! 🤘🤘🤘

FUCKING PHENOMENAL 💯💯💯💯👀
I'm BLOWN AWAYY 🖤🖤
The effort that Ronnie is putting on these re-records is really remarkable. Amazing work
i’ll let him suck my blood any day
alv esto no me esperaba, hoy me sentí nostalgica y escuché bandas que años no les seguía su trayectoria y veo este video XD, no me acostumbro a verlo  sin delineador. Está chido uwu
this is how u start 2021
Охуенно!!! 🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻
.... if he made a whole album of cinematic vampire music I would not be mad about it. <3
Wtf was that..
Masterpiece came again!! R.I.P Derek Jones
Isn't this the same house as the one where Palaye Royale filmed "Tonight is the night i die" music video?
What happened to my boi’s tattoos
This is would be a good ass movie this is amazing
Can someone say that woman’s name? I-I think she’s pretty 😳
That screaming part gave me chills so hard that I had to turn on the electric stove.
Wow
Rip
Love this video so much. But the memory to Derek is was truly got me. 🖤
Wow
Dracula (The musical)
This is incredible af. Please keep it up
Damn. This was an absolute masterpiece.
He Seriously NEEDs to be a Movie Director / Writer.  He would make sick movies and even make the music for it
Just WOW!!! was not expecting this, new favorite song!
parabéns você é um deus
Goosebumps!
This man is a musical GENIUS!

Omg Paige!!!! Stunning ❤❤❤
Wow.. I was left speechless
Anyone else see the dude on the middle of choir. It looks like the dude with the Jason mask from the original “I’m not a Vampire” video.
WOW.
Yawnnn

That was a fucking journey.
He is definitely getting this music doen to a T

The mountain top scenery looks like where they filmed the Thor/Loki/Iron Man fight
Okaay so I already fucking love the original but holy fuck I am crushing so hard on how handsome Ronnie is like fucking hell I'm just shocked!!
This song was so beautifully done! 10/10 🖤
it's like they went from trying to be My Chemical Romance to now Avenged Sevenfold.  This newer stuff is so much better
Omggggg 😍😍😍 I’m in love 😍😍😍
Been teasing us on twitch for this for awhile! Amazing!
The Emo Ozzy Ozbourne has returned
Video is amazing and on a side note, Saraya looks stunning as usual.

U NEVER MISS RONNIE , I LOVE THISSSSSS <3333
THIS IS FREAKING GOOD<3
omg Ronniee<3 and paige <3 its like a movie .. The video <3
"Hi My name is Ronnie, I'm an addict" just hits different...
Well I'm not a vampire But I feel like one Sometimes I sleep all day Because I hate the sunlight My hands are always shaking Body's always aching And the dark is when I feed Well I can lure any woman that I want to in my bed With me And whiskey seems to be my holy water Mothers better lock your doors And hide your daughters I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness sake Where is my self control? If home is where my heart is Then my heart has lost all hope Well I'm not a zombie But I feel like one today Self induced comatose, chemical daze My head is always spinning From this dizzy, blurry vision And my stomach has had enough I feel like a lady That is pregnant with a baby 'Cause I'm always throwing up Hi, My name is Ronnie I'm an addict (Hi, Ronnie!) Daddy should've never raised me on Black Sabbath! I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness sake Where is my self control? If home is where my heart is Then my heart has lost all hope God bless all of you now 'Cause I'm going straight to Hell And I'm taking you down with me 'Cause you know damn well I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? I'm insane Well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins When did I become so cold? For goodness sake Where is my self control? If home is where my heart is Then my heart has lost all hope All hope All hope
I feel Peter Bretter should have been involved with this production. Aldous Snow would agree. [Forgetting Sarah Marshall reference].
this will get 1M just from me.
Eu realmente precisava dessa música... ajudou a salvar minha vida.
Ronnie is literally doing my fucking aesthetic tastes a praise with these reimagines of his old songs. I loved it, no matter what you never disappoint me
Yesssssss !! It's so good 😭🙏
YO WHAT THE FUCK HAHAHA this was fucking amazing!
so proud of you ronnie and you guys from falling in reverse are awesome saraya is so beautiful and she is amazing actress
Absolutely speechless that's all I can say 😍 ronnie you are actually the fucking GOAT !
What a birthday present😍
Fucking finally this is the one I been wanting to see reimagined. I love it
I’M OBSESSED WITH VAMPIRES SINCE MY EMO TEEN YEAR THIS IS EVERYTHING!!!! Ronnie my god....can’t be touched....he’s just too genius <3
Damn..
Paige <3
The best way to remember Derek Jones T_T <3
So thats why he was dressed like a vampire lmao and is that Paige??? I love that. And oh god the end hit me hard Derek will always be missed :'(
Is that Paige?
Am I the only one that's been a fan of Ronnie since ETF, that still gets blown away by his progress as a musician/vocalist? I obviously thought he sounded good way back then, as he does now, but the screams in this have so much more emotion and weight behind them compared to his previous work. I think the first time, in my opinion at least, that he actually managed to display intense emotion in screams (SCREAMS, not yells/belted notes) was in Popular Monster, and I truly find it incredible that he's able to keep pushing his limits even this deep into his career.  Love him or hate him as a person (the former for me) you GOTTA admit that his evolution as an artist is truly spectacular.
Is that girl Paige?
perfectly
When loki not in the endgame....
Man that’s one hell of a story here !
Absolutely beautiful! An amazing reimagining!
This is perfect.
Me causó escalofríos ❤️ krajo!
Dear Ronnie, Love the pun.
O M G 😍😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Fucking chills! Spectacular!
Is that Saraya? 😱 😍
AMAZINGGG!!!!
You're getting boring, taking old songs and change them to worse...
Cringe
Why does Ronnie Radke constantly adapt to be my taste in men?
Holy fucking shit. I am speechless
Ronnie back at it again with another fucking masterpiece!!!!!!!
I like this. I'm glad you kept the "fukking" words in this one too. I don't think reimagined would have been as poetic if you had replaced them. It stays true to the original writing process and really emphasizes the progression of what was going through your head through the process. Not "silly" to me, at all.
I wanna see Ronnie in a movie as the lead vampire 🔥🔥🔥
My facking gaaad Ronnie 😲
uffff que perro arte!!!!!
Food for my soul.  Amazing....
Love how you can feel the emotion in Ronnie's voice 🖤
Ronnie never fails to impress me after all these years
Yes
But when's Good Girls Bad Guys Revamped tho?
That’s Paige his gf! That’s so cool! I wish they would release new music as an album though! It’s been long enough!
Wow... That is soo awesome! Ronnie showed that song to us in a different perspective and I am convinced that it is better than original (actually I always think original songs are better than other versions)
BDG's taking his leave from Polygon harder than I expected
DAMN FUCKING AMAZING PRODUCTION!😱😍
This is good for a movie score (and kinda lost the novelty factor that TDIMIY Reimagined had with this aesthetic) but I'm wondering if Ronnie fell out of ideas to keep reworking his older stuff instead of making new material?
damn this song sucks but its always good to see paige.
From being the youngest Divas' Champ to being transformed into a vampire by Ronnie. Paige went a long way...
Thank you please do not stop your MUSIC!!!!! <3
Is paige of WWE?!!! 😃❤
Just Wow WOW WOW, and Love from Germany
DUDE! IM SHAKING WTF!!
goosebumbs.... amazing... wow... Rest In Peace Derek and Christina...
Amazing
Que emoción!!! 🥺❤
Can Ronnie call papa roach and show them how to make an old great song into something that's  awesome. Because that mumble rap version of  last resort is different but not in a good way. It should've been on this level. Great video masterpiece
Just when I say ok I'm play something else on play list this happens and I'm right back to binge listening to falling in reverse all over again. Dam amazing job on video guys and the vocals put pretty much 99% of all other artist to freaking shame! Freaking love this band and they are amazing live
Paige killed it and Ronnie always perfect
Dark Shadow vibes
Not that I’m insane or anything but damn did I feel it in my bones...  Ronnie, you and your band, thank you sooooOOOO much, sincerely, what a ride!
Oh my god, that’s awesome
So when is ronnie releasing ticket to his falling in reverse opera show
Proximamente en netflix xD
WOWWWWW RONNIE IS JUST REIMAGINING ALL HIS SONGS
When a music video is a better love story than Twilight Probably because it is revampired ...
Damn this is awesome
Fuck, I think I need a whole Revamped/Reimagined Album
That man can sing his ass off. Great rendition and as always, perfect story telling in the vid.
AMAZING but.... I was really hoping for a new single :(
Holy fuck this is beautiful, Ronnie is a true genius
NOW THIS IS A FUCKING
fuuuuuuuuckin awesome
Thanks for this gift on my birthday ! As well as last year ) The Drug In Me Is Reimagined )
Such a beautiful masterpiece! Just when you think his material cannot get any better, it gets better! What a great artist!🤘❤
I need a whole album of these reimagined/revamped songs!! And I need it now!!
This is an exquisite music video
Speechless 👏
Damnnnn son did it again !! Let's go!!!
That had to be one of the best music videos I have seen in a long time
Probs to the producer the soundmix is fantastic
Great twist up Ronnie love my dude
Haters better put some respect on Ronnie's name now
i like the way your are going with those songs alot
Holy- this is amazing

I've been waiting for about a week for this! I thought it had to do with popular monster because of his pictures with his tattoos covered, but this is even better:)
Yasas 🥴
Yes I've been waiting for this and its really good he even got his gf paige in it. This really put it all together now and I can relax this is the best song I've listen too this year brilliant job to all who made this music video happen 😊😊😊😊😊🌹🌹🌹🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶

Musically speaking, the episodes are way better, please make more of those in the future
Mola como siempre

Even better than The Drug In Me In Reimagined in my opinion. and I thought it couldnt get better. now I am just even more excited about the next release
time goes by and Ronnie looks younger every time
Holy heavens above!!

The fact that Paige is finally in one of his music videos is amazing
I'm speechless! Amazing Ronnie! 😍
i love how he's remastering his edgy emo songs into elegant goth symphonies
And they have done it again. Amazing song and crazy storytelling
RONNIE! You and Raya didn’t have to FLEX ON THEM LIKE THAT! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Auto tune is gay
when the monks turn up....just....perfection
Ok Ronnie We Get it You're Perfect
Okay ngl he be lookin classy
WOWWWWWW THIS VIDEO IS JUST AMAZING..........
I don't remember this episode of TVD
Can we just appreciate the amazing lighting and attention to detail in this video? Great job whoever directed this. Edit: Just looked at the description, keep it up Jensen Hoen
Damn i could listen to a whole album of reimagined hits. Popular Monster would give an amazing revamp too!
I also love how creative he has been with his latest videos 🖤🖤🖤
He broke the masquerade. I bet Pronce led the mob to him
I LOVE IT

He kind of resembles a young Davey Havok with his hair like that.
THIS WAS UNEXPECTED AND FUCKING AWESOME
I love it 😍
First Time Listening - okay.. this was to epic Third Time Listening - Well.. this was way to epic Tenth Time Listening - I'M NOT A VAMPIRE!!!!

Ronnie strikes again.
Omffff my inner emo teenager is getting ready to make a come back
This video this song. Pure lust and perfect vibe.
resident evil 8 inspired?  👀👀
This is amazing!!
Wow this hit me like the drug in me is
They are out so much of their talent in their music and it comes out amazing.I think there teasing their album the drug in me is you is turning 10 years old this here and they're making newer verisons of their songs.
Just... damn
This is amazing
Video was so freaking kick-ass!!! 🤘
OMG IS BEAUTIFUL! ♥️
2011 Radke: “WELL, I’M NOT A VAMPIRE-“ 2021 Radke: “Yeah, about that...”
Mmmmkay...yeah I wasn't feeling it.
Ronnie is a rare breed that can make a hit twice in a row with the same song
Meh.
the music video outsold twilight and the vampire diaries , argue with me
WoW awesome..!
Amazing⚡
I Kant find the comments I liked when this uploaded- ;;;;
Just one word : Masterpiece.
This ain't it chief
Omg, Paige is on another level, go WWE Queen!!! Im soo thrilled to finally see her in a music video!!! We need to see more of her!!!
Derek would be proud,that is an AMAZING remake
Dracula by Bram Stoker the best movie of vampires i’ll take it back this is the freaking best movie🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻😉🤟🏻😉🤟🏻😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉

What cant Ronnie do, fucking banger!
This is a fucking masterpiece Ronnie.
perfect
I am in love with this version and the music video
Okay I still adore the original, she holds a special place in my heart but holy fuck I'm shook! I'm happy they are getting the appreciation they've always deserved just makes me sad that for the last seven years I've loved them they were hated and only now everyone's changed their minds. Nothings changed with them, they've always been this good👌🖤Ronnie has always switched the scene up amazingly and I'm proud to see this for them. It hurts we'll never get a guitar solo quite like Dereks again :(
Ok lastat
Awesome powerful vocals as usual love it.
We Need New Album, Nothing More
Wow. Absolutely Brilliant Ronnie. Paige a beauty as always. ❤️❤️
HAAAAUUUUY MAUY NAME IS RAWWNY, AUYM AN ADDICT! ❤️
super loving how Ronnie slipped in some Black Metal vocals at 3:30. His ability to blend elements from across genres is unmatched.
Well damn dude! RIP Derek
Re falling in..
I am shook... This is amazing!!!!
Мороз по коже... Атмосферно...А где же Элина?)
MASTERPIECE
Holy fucking shit 🤘🔥🤘

Силиконовые груди и накачанные губы портят всё впечатление от клипа.
jezuzz!! im..im left speechless
Nostalgia on the lyrics man
ronnie say : You better drive that fucking stake right down my heart and (?) i think ronnie actually a vampire and him call his heart and another body part of vampires and we don't know the name's of body part
Wow. Amazing on so many different levels

God damn. Just in time.
FUCKING BEAUTIFUL!!! YOURE SUCH A GENIUS RONNIE!!
What a masterpiece this is
Every time Falling In Reverse drops a new track I binge it for five months straight!
I never knew Tommy Wiseau was this good a singer
This is the same mansion as in Tonight is the night I die by Palaye Royale that is also vampire themed, so now I'll pretend that they exist in the same vampireverse
Cecilion and carmilla?? xD Soy fan de FIR desde el 2012
I WILL LITERALLY NEVER LEAVE MY EMO PHASE 😂🔥
You did it again, Ronnie! oh hell yeah \m/
Straight up art. Beautiful.
W-where's the "Hi ronnie!"
Speechless...

Ermagurd...  God damn Ronnie, you sir have such great talent and I love your music. Thank you for this!!! Wow, just wow... Your voice gets me in the feels every time...

I love your ban but sorry this one is bad ..
Holy fuck I didn’t not expect this!! AMAZING Ronnie!!!!!!
Ronnie fico parecendo os volturi da saga crepúsculo haha,nice musica <3
Very good
I always wanted the song to reflect the vampire route and this delivered. I been listening  nonstop since I heard it at 3am. It 4pm rn. And im still listening.
I'll be absolutely honest: I only watched this video because Paige posted a tweet about it. So, in conclusion, I can say that I'm here for Paige.
Wow amazing!!! Another epic video I loved it, the original song was one of my favorites. Ronnie you're and amazing artist we love you.
This was absolutely incredible!
Cadis Etrama Di Raizel
While I have enjoyed every FIR song I've come across, the reimaginings are really grabbing my attention. I love this direction, Ronnie.
CASTLEVANIA IN REVERSE
Are we sure he’s not a vampire?
Meh not bad its ok only watched to see Paige lol
My favorite song got a revamped
Okay Ronnie we get it, you're a pure genius at everything you do. Especially with this _revamped_ version of *"I'm Not A Vampire"*
OH HI PAIGE!!! ❤❤❤
King Dracula Who?????😍😍😍
YOOO! Ronnie my good sir, you've outdone yourself again. Instant classic
okay.. was war das bitte für ein Video?! Einfach nur krass!! Was für eine grandiose Arbeit <3
B-R-A-V-O! Esto es arte, es lo mejor que he visto
As soon as he did “The Drug In Me Is Reimagined” I had the biggest feeling he’d do this, really hope he does the full album like I think he will
I love this Ronnie, holly fuck man this is AWESOME !!
Ronnie sus??
4:27 noooooo poor Ronnie
I think he’s a Vampire 🧛🏻
This is sick! Great movie
Someone give this man a Grammy, he deserves it.
man, this one really brought me to tears... it's rare for a song to do that, but just... wow... I still can't believe that Derek has been gone for almost a year now. I really think that this is truly one of the best songs to come out in 2021. and now, I'm really hoping for a whole reimagined album
Ronnie baby this is just poetry. Damnnnnnn 😍
I need to watch the movie
In Brazil we call this "Foda"
i needed this
GODDAMN MOVIE, those effects were crazy and the whole revamp of this song is so fucking amazing! 2021 cant be better now. So goooooooooood ♥
WHY IS RONNIE LIFE?! I’ve been on a 3 month music bender of listening to falling in reverse songs on repeat. This makes me so happy. I love Ronnie so friggin much
Brutal.
Wow!!!!!!!!🖤
What I’ve been waiting for
Beautiful! That's all I can say.
Ronnie Radke: the musical
Who else liked it before it started?????
In another life, Ronnie could've been a theatre singer- holyyyyy crapppp this man can sing!!

Legendary shit  GOAT

Ronnie radke... Please please please revamp situations that would be insane
HOLY FUCK

When I first started watching this, I sensed something was wrong...then realized his face tattoos were gone LOL
Nananana buenardoooo

Ronnie has a voice like an angel
If they end up doing a reimagining of the whole album I'll die
WOW WOW WOW !!
Unexpected and glorious. Loving these big epic arrangements.  RIP Derek <3
Ronnie Radke is an absolute genius. The actual Mercury, im sure of that.
Cover own song. Meeh. No ideas for something new?
I love the og version but dude if that s not amazing
Fucking ronnie. You outdid yourself again. Incredible it was like a movie. I want more of FIV !!!
AAAA ME ENCANTAAA💓
W O W !
I think that’s wwe’s page
This was EPIC! This need to become a Movie or Musical. He needs to do this with the whole Album. Both me and my wife sitting here with our mouth wide open. Standing ovation!!!
Next gotta be raised by wolves plzzzzzz!
Oh. My. GOD! 😍🥰  This is so freaking amazingly put together and of course I had no doubt going in that it would be. Well done, Ronnie. 💕
Llore con el texto de al final:(
Paige and Ronnie!!!!!! And more revamp of TDIMIY album!!! 🥰🥰🥰🥰
Shit. Oryginal was fuckin awesom, this is crap. Wtf is going on. Im taking back my sub. This is the worst thing that happend to this world except covid 19.
Just WOW
Masterpiece!!!! Love from Portugal!
"Hi my name Is Ronnie"
So year by year, one-by-one, they're turning The Drug in Me is You into something Reimagined. Wow
In loving memory of Derek Jones 😭😢😢😭
I CRIED WATCHING THIS BECAUSE ITS SO DAMN GOOD!!!!
OMG 😱😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😳😳😳😳😳😳😂😂😂😂😂
Torment. That’s the only word I can describe this with. Beautifully done. I need a lyric video tho
Every time you play it sounds better
Masterful composition, holy hell
Truly a legend. Miss seeing this guy perform live
Fuck yeah Ronnie!
This song fucks
Waiting for the classic Twilight jokes:  "The new Twilight movie looks dope" "Still a better love story than Twilight" "Does Ronnie sparkle in the sunlight?" "Team Jacob or Team Edward? (Fuck that! Team Ronnie) Any more I'm missing?  Jokes aside. Incredible song and video guys. Goosebumps everytime.
OH YEAHHH
Man the day Ronnie stops making music is the day the world truly ends!
I have nothing to say. Nothing but Beautiful !  Ronnie is one of the best vocalist today. Derek would be pround. 🙏
His vocals are amazing!!!  I applaud you, Ronnie.
reVAMPED
get it Ronnie
What a voice.
Bruh im lost for words.. this is on an even higher level then most music out there
A great tribute to Derek, gone, but never forgotten <3
amo falling in reverse mas infelizmente odeio acustico, nao consigo engolir muito mas bom video 👍🏻
@ronnie Radke how can someone go about contacting you? Just found contact info. If possible I am in need of a response...
This is just so good
This went from an awesome start to the Emo kid having a meltdown in front of the school during lunch...
Muito bom!
I'm gnna take yo chick son. GWARIZAMA gang up in this bitch now.  We dont sing, we scream.  😂
I wish u can make a cover of every song u ever made
WOW OMG-
I f****** love it 🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
Keep it up Ronnie god damn. Vocals are so good and the video is great.
Yes!
You did great on this ronnie. Was i the only one that started crying while watching this? Lmaoo
LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS!!
@RonnieRadke @SarayaOfficial I don’t even have any words... the words to express the feels don’t even exist yet!!! 💯🤘🏼🔥💋🥰♥️
---> I was here BEFORE 10 million views. EPIC.
fastest 6 minutes of my life
something i didn’t know i needed
Where rapcore? Where ? Where?
Absolutely AMAZING. It was like a movie
No one else disappointed?
Few people will recognize Ronnie Radke for the entire God he just became. This is literally the definition of evolvement. On so many deeper levels than music. The admittance near the end of “I’m a vampire“. Owning his demons and who he his. Man 👌🏻👏🏻🧛🏻‍♂️
Shout out to all the people who've been following Ronnie since Escape the fate. Y'all are the real OGs
THIS IS EPIC
The original song is good... but this version is a whole new level... i just love it
The amount of angst here is ASTOUNDING
This song is a masterpiece with the rest of em!! , I love this song so much!!!
WOW
This is just a masterpiece.
If he make a version like this of "caught like a fly" my heart will explode
Как же это охуенно 😍😍😍
nope. wtf is this?
Well there is deffo no filter on emotions, and its good to express them, specially creatively, including romatic drama style 🎭 cause if you bottle stuff up, it just eats at you from the inside, which can also be torturous on a different level, not just physically but also spiritually. The melody of the piano is beautiful and a pure voice. Not that you need my opinion, or analogy. Very clever composition. Not one of my favourite lyric wise, or graphically, not gone on the screaming bit on personal note, but still love your pure and beautiful voice and piano melody and what you do, well... you own it and no body will compete lol ! A complete random stranger on the internet of magic
Wow he did it again, 🔥🔥🔥💯, Need to get on it
Im gonna say this. He kinda looks like Tommy Wiseau
Uh this kinda looks like the Palaye Royale music video for tonight is the night I die
I'm not crying, you're crying
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
I cried watching this
Ваууу я такого ещё ни когда не видела!!! Браво, это великолепно!👏🤯
So is Ronnie a werewolf or vampire which one😂
Can we appreciate how stunning Paige is in this too??
Next up: Raised By Wolves (Reawakened)
Omg omg! Ever since I heard the drug in me is u reimagined I thought he had to make a ballad of I'm not a vampire! And my wish got fulfilled! Holy shit. I couldn't appreciate the music bcuz visually it was stunning n it was a lot going on.. But mostly Paige was a distraction bcuz.. SHE IS GORGEOUS HERE! THis is the best she's ever looked!   But I will have to say drug in me is reimagined is still up there
Holy fuckin shit yo... I didn't expect anything less out of Ronnie for sure but it still takes my breath away, gives me chills, and brings tears to my eyes.... damnit Ronnie, ya did it again! Well done!!
Who is that woman I've seen her before. And recently.  Cant remember tho
Rip Derek jones🙏
I just wanna say, I had a heart attack the whole time and by the end I cried and was shaking I was so overwhelmed I love it so much. Like I can’t breathe.
The thing with Ronnie is that he had no emotions in his screams in the beginning of his career, but god damn now.. what an evolution .
Beautiful !!
Beatifful 😍
Thanks Ronnie!!! Please keep up this reimagined, revamped, whatever series. Just lovin' it! You are full of talent!
*chefs kiss*
Ronnie i love you
Oh so this is why you grew out your hair. You look like a Dracula
At first was like “another slow one, fine.” This shit is good and wasn’t expecting a damn intensely amazing theatrical musical!
such a beautiful song 🔥🔥
YES OMG JZJDI IAIIAIZIZKAIIAIA AAAAAA
He would have to be one of the best versatile artists ever
Another masterpiece
MYYY GOOOOOD... it's a fkin masterpiece! I love every second of it!
This is absolutely epic
Just awesome Ronnie, be at peace Derek Jones.
No one covers Ronnie's songs better than Ronnie.
NO FUCKING WAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
OMG!!!
I loved watching every single second of this. ✨Masterpiece✨
Wow... No other words needed. I'm blown away
This man is so far ahead of anything in music rn it’s not even funny. Been saying this every time he’s released something since fashionably late. He got so much hate in those days and now everybody’s dickriding
Listened the song like 20 times and still gives me chills
I'm Not A Vampire: A movie by Falling In Reverse
I'm so glad I get to live in a world with Falling in Reverse Been a fance since 09 at 6 years old!
HOLY MOTHER OF GOD THIS WAS EPIC

THIS IS BEYOND INCREDIBLE!!
Wow that was a fucking movie ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Just pure epicness!!!!!!

Next not good enough for truth in cliche
Where is the collison on camera with powerwolf! Vampires and Werewolves babyyyyy
This is sooooo good
[Verse 1] Well, I'm not a vampire, but I feel like one Sometimes I sleep all day 'cause I hate the sunlight My hands are always shaking, body's always aching, and the dark is when I feed Well, I can lure any woman that I want to in my bed with me  [Pre-Chorus 1] And whiskey seems to be my holy water And mothers, better lock your doors and hide your daughters  [Chorus] 'Cause I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold? For goodness sake's, where is my self-control? If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all hope  [Verse 2] Well, I'm not a zombie, but I feel like one today Self-induced comatose, chemical daze My head is always spinning from this dizzy blurry vision, and my stomach has had enough I feel like a lady that is pregnant with a baby 'cause I'm always throwing up  [Pre-Chorus 2] And hi, my name is Ronnie, I'm an addict And daddy should've never raised me on Black Sabbath  [Chorus] I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold? For goodness sake's, where is my self-control? If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all hope  [Post-Chorus] When will you mortals believe? I just want the world to be Lost at the sight of your blood, Swear to god!  [Bridge] So God bless all of you now 'Cause I'm going straight to Hell And I'm taking you down with me Because you know damn well  [Pre-Chorus 3] So I sharpened my teeth 'cause I love the way it feels When I sink into your skin and drop the only thing that's real You don't believe me, should I write it in blood? You better drive that fucking stake right through my heart and try and run Motherfucker, I'm a vampire   [Chorus] I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold? For goodness sake's, where is my self-control? If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all, heart has fucking lost all, heart has lost all hope All hope, my heart has lost all hope   (Pretty sure these are correct! Hope this helps people! Rip Derek🖤)
Fucking Masterpiece🔥
OMG Paige, you look amazing, girrrrrrl🤩
HIII RONNIEEE
Okay back again.....can we talk about the fucking vocal progression Ronnie has made through his career!?!??!?! God damn Ronnie..... TALENT!!! PIPES!!!!
There are a few people who easily make me, a lesbian, confused about my sexuality, currently Ronnie is one of them...
ronnie turning gold into diamonds with these reimagined songs.. man is a musical God. A masterpiece.
That was amazing
the finest opera soliloquy I have ever seen
THIS A MUSICAL FUCKING GOD!!!!!!!! FUCK YESSS! This dude right here, should be winning every award available, and be at the top of every fucking list their is. But for some reason Ronnie just doesn't get the hype from the gatekeepers. I say, Fuck the gatekeepers. Ronnie has always been a musical MUST and a gift straight from the gods themselves. Thank the gods!
fuck, do an opera show, you geniuses!!
This is great but damn I wish it wasn't so auto tuned
Amazing 💕
This is incredible, gorgeous, beautiful... You've outdone yourself. I'm in awe. Completely blown away. I always have high expectations for Falling In Reverse but the ceiling has been shattered. You've risen to another level of art.
OH My FUCKING GOD,  IT`s so gooooooooood  <3
Was this filmed at Ronnie’s house in the San Fernando Valley in LA? This also reminds me of Meatloafs I’d do anything for love.
I waited for this moment since the drug in me is reiamgined! I knew that day will come. thank you ronnie!! <3
Well, I need new pants now.... That was.... Euphoric.
This is amazing
This dude NEEDS to go on The Masked Singer. He can sing a lot of different genres & styles. This was incredible
:0000000000000000000000 *-*
AMAZING!!! 😍😍
Epitaph: you can't make another reimagined song. Ronnie: hold my mic stand.
Craaaazy quality, Jesus christ😳
Reborn. Reimagined. And REVAMPED.
absolutely amazing
I'm fangirling soo hard right now! This is what I mean when I say Falling in Reverse is my favorite band🖤 They never disappoint, plus FIR was the band that made me emo.
How the fuck can anyone compete with this band anymore lol just changed the game even more
MASTERPIECE!!!!!
You are the best Ronnie !!!!!!!!

Movie trailer version. I love it
I was not expecting a masterpiece but holy shit that was amazing
that is the most beautiful vampire song ever! WOW!!!
Как перестать это слушать, чёрт меня дери?
Amazing...
holy shit. they've added more shit and this sounds so good omg
🧀
This gave me chills 😍
I want an Amy Lee feature in the next one
My body is shaking soo good my god he is a music god I am telling uu😤😤
esto es sencillamente increíble
Amazing images. This song shows the level of development you have made as a artist. Nothing but respect from this fan. Can’t wait to see you live again 🍻
in loving memory of derek jones❤
This reminded me a lot about the movie "Interview with a vampire "
Ronnie without tattoo looks wonderful
That begining gave me "Gangsta's Paradise" vibes, also it's sweet to see Paige in this
Wow that was amazing
In love as usual
Am I the only one who thinks ronnie looks better with his tattoos? But GAWD that hair, and that voice. Goosebumps!
Oh my goth i loved it😍
Went from an amazing Scene band with eyeliner and edge, to a mature, wise group of people who make such a variety of amazing music
This is EPIC!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is my house!
I have never cried at a song, revamped or not or at a music video in life. This is breathtaking and beautiful
So fuckin awesome, Ronnie you are the best🤟🏻
wow. that was tremendous. also paige <3
You’ve truly done it this time, after all the anticipation you’ve presented this masterpiece and it’s everything I hoped it would be PLUS more. 👏👏
CARALHOOOO CARALHOOO????? MANO TO SEM PALAVRAS PRA ESSA OBRA DE ARTE
Damn it, I didn't think it would be possible to top the drug in me is you reimagined, but ronnie done it. Dude is seriously like a fine wine just getting better with age. At this point if he wants to just reimagine or "revamp"  the entire first album that would be completely fine with me.
He is literally a GENIUS
OH MANNN I LOVE THIS
Oh my god, paige is a ✨DIOSA✨
And now we have  Ronnie as a Gothic King From Falling in Reverse And Amy Lee Gothic Queen from Evenescence  We need both of them in a song 🖤🖤
HOLY FUCK THIS WAS EPIC
Sick vid! Reminds me of the phantom of the opera a bit
3:23 and 3:53 are the best bits 🥺
this is art
The ending omg 😲 goosebumps 😭
This is just fucking Amazing
IT's just Like a film song GOD DAMN, WHY CAN ONLY HIT LIKE ONE TIME?
First I listen yesterday, on spotify
A Sag and Leo would be this dramatic, love it
No le sabe
THE GOAT BACK IN ACTION
Балдеж,балдежно ,балдею
if you don't play this at my funeral I'm not coming
Remember the vampire fangs in the drug in me is reimagined.
this. this is what art really is. A R T.
A new master piece!!!!🤘🤘👌👌👌😍😍😍
Amazing!
Ronnie Depp
HOLY SHITHOLYSHITHOLYSHIT I LOVE THIS AHHHHH

EPICCCCCC
Ice nine kills vibes

Interview with a Vampire vibes. Good song.
Wow!! How absolutely beautifully stunning! I love how I can see the emotions in this story and the visuals are absolutely gorgeous!! Beautiful job well done!!
Ronnie has such a brilliant mind. This was beyond epic on so many levels. Can't say much more except, hell yes and thanks for the amazing song/video!

Fucking epic!
Damn, turns out he is a vampire after all 🤷🏽‍♂️
Bro, I just finished the video and I’m speechless. Wtf was that piece of art
FIRE
make this man the fucking lead in a movie already!!!
I got about a minute in. I knew the words by heart, but somehow I didn’t. What a surreal feeling.❤️
I haven't listened to something this epic in a long time.
Did Tim Burton direct this?
Love you
wow
Daaaamn bro.. You're killin' it again! Love it!
Мне всегда интересно, такие красивые места, это что-то реальное, там музей или что.. Или это просто декорации. Такой замок красивущий 🙏
Better than Twilight 😣
This man can revamp any song
He talked about putting in a chorus of people signing in the background for The Drug in me is Reimagined... lol looks like he made his vision come true in this one. Good shit!
How good does Ronnie and Paige look in this video 😍😍
NOT.PREPARED.FOR.THIS! What a masterpiece!
fiquei viciado!
Кто после сторис Элины?😂
AÍ FOMOS SURPREENDIDOS NOVAMENTE
YOOOO THIS IS INSANE
This is better than twilight
I got fucking goosebumps
Esto no es un video musical es una obra de arte!
Yeaaaaaah🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟😎
Putting “(Revamped)” instead of “(Reimagined)” is what made me laugh
Yooooo Ronnie, you really outdid yourself this time, Kudos, much love, and I wish you well in all that you do!
Впечатляюще
I'm literally crying
Oooh my God this is my favorite song and this version in a masterpiece I'm in love with Ronnie's voice with these melodies 😭❤️ and THAT FINAL WHAAAAAAT my heart was torn apart 😱
revamped haha I get it cause vamp haha
Hopefully FIR can come out with some heavier stuff like the other albums soon. Otherwise, great job with the cinematic and song. I like his older stuff but I’m a long time supporter of FIR so anything is good :)
I loved the tribute to Derek. Its going to be so hard when I finally get to see FIR again. It will be my first show in ten years without him... And I always am on the right side of the stage when I go 😢
Just, wow.
YES RONNIE!! Man you're seriously the most genius and talented musician out there 😍
