Dylan, Saved By the Bell walked so Boy Meets World could run.
21:17 they already have that type of movie. It is called bee movie.
Fun fact - the DVD version has an extra about how rats spread the plague lol. Dylan would love that
Not all rats carry diseases it really depends on the species and environment
20:25 FUN FACT THIS SHOP IS REAL I FOUND IT ON MY TRIP TO PARIS AND OMFG ITS IDENTICAL AND IT HAS THE RATS AND EVERYTHING 😭😭
First Dylan: I love the nose ring, it looks awesome. Second: The glasses make you look like that one smart dude from that Atlantis Disney movie!!!
33:53. No dylan. I had pet mice and rats(different times, 1 at a time except the mice) growing up... if i saw a rat or mous in my house.... id literslly keep it as a pet. It gets to live, and in luxury. Its a win/win
6:10 ive seen mice & rats either in my house or other ppls houses or out in public and ive never once tried to kill them. if theyre in my house ill js usually try to catch them with a plastic bowl or hit them with my broom out the door
PIERREEEE GASLYYYYYYY!!
21:02 So casually cruel in the name of being funny xd
(As a French woman) yes, yes we are 😌
This was a fun watch 😊
You mention boy meets world a lot, not only in this video, but you havent made a video of it yet. Can you do that??
the witch hunts culled the cats so the rat population exploded which led to the plague, as far as i know.
It is awful how this movie is incredibly good and funny but sooo insulting to French people. -Our culture is not well represented at all. -Our accent is mocked -The final dish is not even a ratatouille but a tian provençale. - We are represented as crazy people who could kill you for nothing and then kiss you like our lives depends on it.  But the movie is soo good! I hate it and I love it at the same time.
17:42 i love when they do ‘moving cameras’ and stuff like that in animation
Those who were waiting for him to say Pierre Gasly
Dylan talked about she being in love with the rat and now I really need him to watch Bee Movie
You are far more likely to get an illness from other humans not washing up than another species because most viruses don't cross between species like that - they specialize in one and reproduce rapidly with that advantage. Every year you can get sick multiple times just from being around your own kind, but your pets won't catch it from you.
“is that a gun!!?, oh good an umbrella, omg a gun!!!?” genuinely iconic
5:07 It depends on how heavy the subject is.
4:33 They don’t help Santa deliver presents?!
22:12 If you could see Collette's face she looks down. She also thinks hes talking about his junk 😂
we tried to watch it with our kids (3 and 6) but it was not how funny and light I remembred it to be.
Colette is 100% a baddie and should've left linguini at the end of the movie. Their entire time together was a lie.
dylan, you are underestimating how much strong women like a goofball
Dylan: How is this allowed? It's G rated! Dylan's video reccomended to me next: Despicable me doesn't have enough death
She likes him cause his kissing game is apparently on point
Does anyone think that Pierre is a mouse and not a rat
It’s one of the only Disney movies where I think the villain was rat for wanting to denounce the restaurant to hygiene service ! 😂  And I genuinely feel bad for him 😵‍💫
Technically fleas started the plague the rats just spread it
rewatching this on my birthday cause dylan always makes me laugh
Ratatouille should NOT be G rated. I was absolutely terrified of it as a kid.
29:40 look at 24:28 . Jacque already was teaching skating to Colette, cause apparently he's good at only skating.
I love ego. He’s a good antagonist. And I’m not mad about reform either 🤌🏻
8:26 Thank God! When this movie came out YEARS ago, I thought I was weird for being grossed out by animated rats in a kitchen.
4:01 "GIRLLL"🤣 15:37 all three of us are simping my dude 25:35
It was the FLEAS on the rats 😅
Fun fact, this movie did not get a mcdonalds sponsorship I believe because they couldn’t put rat toys in a happy meal lol
Hell no i wouldn’t kill a mouse or a rat if i found one in my house…idk why people are even so scared of them when you could literally step on one and it would die
Dylan saying how its unrealistic how remy (Jacque?) wouldnt have time to teach all of the other rats is jokes, theres a rat cooking better than the best chefs in paris and he's questioning whether the rat would have time to teach other rats?🤣
I love how Dylan is vaguely rat-like doing a commentary on this movie
I just noticed the way Skinner's suspicion of Remy being in the hat was framed similar to how the antagonist of The Iron Giant suspected seeing the titular character on the kid's photos. And I liked it. A style Brad Bird has I would say, to portray a somber-like tone to his animated films. The Incredibles has an eerie-like quality too when it came to suspicious scenes.
I honestly feel so seen that someone gets as upset as I do about the space bar not pausing it
i'd argue linguini has one phenominal skill. He's probaly the best waiter i've ever seen hahah
I do feel bad for the head chef. Let's be real even if Linguine is the heir, he literally knows nothing of the restaurant let alone how to make boiled water.
17:40 reminds me of how they film “The Office”
History fact it's actually the fleas that pass the disease that was then pass to rats that would pass it to others by being an uber to the flea that is infected 😂.
he doesn't like violence but gets upset when people don't die in movies😂❤  Dylan absolutely love the channel keep up the good work
0:28 my grandpa used to say he had an iron trap and that it was so good that it just didnt let anything back out once it went in, and that was why he couldnt remeber it
I laughed so hard as he said "omg he is me.." with the realization written on his face x'D
32:07 “oh my god he’s me” HAHAHA THE REALIZATION
12:04  they way I'm going "ITS THE FLEAS" like that 'its under the sauce' audio lol  Dylan the rats are getting a bad rap, THEY JUST CARRIED THE FLEAS THAT HAD THE PLAGUE
My little sisters were much more tolerant of micea when I was younger - they put on thick gloves and relocated the mices outside in the wild and only told me and my mom later 😂
Calling Remmie Pierre is so funny
How did you not notice the glance down she does when he says “I have a little” like she indeed did think “p***s”
Guys, I got three fortnite adds while watching this video. WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE WORLDD????
"Moose ... they're not what you think they are." Absolutely. We've been fed Rocky and Bullwinkle propaganda for too long.  There needs to be a movie where a moose is the villain.
Pls stop doing that accent you’re making me uncomfortable 0:02
Remy's name changed to jacque now?? I thought that the name of the rat is Remy. I get bothered when Dylan calls Remy Jacque
9:14 - I'm CRYING 😭😭😭
When he went "he's just a goofball with no talent" and then paused, it took exactly one second for me to understand exactly what he was thinking 🤣🤣🤣
Dylan: Why is there so much violence?!  also Dylan: *give me violence*
I just recommended my friend this channel and this is the first video she's watching. And I fear she's going to think I'm a frickin weirdo for liking dylan
Bruh took this movie way too seriously when he brought up the rat not being able to guide everyone in the kitchen lmao 😂
The worst part is when I realized the rat is Patton Oswald.
9:13 im just gonna leave this right here
I so love how much appreciation you have for how this movie was crafted and storyboarded. This one is often forgotten about, but I think it's legitimately one of the best movies Pixar has put out.  Also, I think you may have missed it, but when Linguini was trying to explain the situation to Colette in the street, and he says "I have a tiny... little..." there is a blink-and-you-miss-it shot where she briefly glances down to his crotch. This movie did great with the subtle adult humor.  Edit: Regarding Colette and Linguini: I think she likes him because, as a woman in a profession surrounded by men with big egos, Linguini is a quiet, humble, polite guy who listens to her.
6:26 me for the next minute trying my hardest to be quiet and not wake everyone up while I'm busting up laughing. I'm just waiting for the part where they suddenly kiss
3:50 Little does he realize how accurate he is as he literally appears as a ghostlike form later on🤣
12:13 exactly how my existential crisis thought process goes🫠
Dylan Linguini's cute as hell you wouldn't get it
Those dishwasher machines the rats clean themselves in get REALLY HOT. They would die in there for sure.
I been to paris a few times and i gotta say, this movie nails how they act😂 there is a reason we Europeans dont like french😂
Wow great segway into the ad! I hate it
In Paris people bring dogs to restaurants the time. So big deal rats.
Dylan I’m just starting to listen to audible
Dylan, I got a whole ass pet rat after growing up on this movie... I am NOT killing any rats 😅
Moore Matthew Allen Nancy Taylor Donald
Garcia Sandra Wilson Charles Hernandez Kevin
"I have made no secret of my disdain for Chef Gusteau's saying "anyone can cook", but I realize only now what he truly meant. Not everyone can become a great artist, but a great artist can come from anywhere."  That's just beautiful. When you get down to it, this movie is about prejudice and biases, so there's a great message for kids, coming from the "villian" of the story.
It's kind of funny that this is possibly the best cooking film out there 😂
please watch wall-e
I find it funnt that he asks for a scene where collete shows liguini hiw to skate when there is a scene that literally shows its him teaching her
2:56 You've really helped me to appreciate visual framing! Even if it's animated. I never used to notice these things but it explains the quality when you understand the details.  On a random side note I got an affinity for rats from the videogame Total War: Warhammer. The Skaven are so cool.
the lewd jokes are why I love this movie to this day :'D
Not gonna lie dylan in the this video reminds me of James mcavoy when he was younger
this is a comfort video for me and i hate that for myself. no shade to dylan but seriously why am i here so often?
Omg i love you so much dylan you're my favorite person to react to movies and daz games is my favorite person to watch  play games because hes hilarious and your really funny two you two  are my favorite youtubers you always make my day and make me laugh and it helps with my depression and anxiety
His rollerskating skills are the only thing he has
The moose thing is so real im Canadian and them bitches are Gargantua’s
What on earth is that sound effect at 0:12??? I thought an ambulance zoomed by my house!
20:11 as a kid I used to think it was insane that they put this like wtf I get they’re trying to show that ppl see rats as pests but like this is so insane why would there be a store with that?! …and then one day walking in Paris I found a pest control store that looked like this and was like WTF?! And seeing this now has made me realize this is probably the most realistic and actually accurate part of the whole movie lmfao
Lee Margaret Miller Carol Martinez Brian
Just a quick psa, there are no moose in France, they do have wild boar though
Dylan thirsting after collete is everything
25:33 Sometimes we don't need words to understand
I’ve always love this movie but I absolutely love you explaining thing like camera work, when the sound effects come in ext, it makes me feel like I know what I’m looking at when I watch movies now ❤
Dylan looks like BBNO$
Is it safe to assume....that Dylan miGHT have a thing for women that shoot, are dominant, and might kidnap you..?.....HMMMMM
31:05-31:20 The fact that the Ratatouille tastes like his mother used to make would actually invalidate his praises as a critic because of bias, but then Skinner tried it too and couldn't hide his pleasure, validating it again. I'm not sure if the writers had this in mind, but it's interesting.
25:30-25:40 Yes. This was 100% on purpose.
Dylan:kill the dad(straight face) 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
"I need to warn the world about mooses." For a moment there, my brain went "mousses" (chocolate puddings) instead of the animal.
The shop where the rats are hung up in the window is based on a real pest exterminator shop in France (not around now though however)
Everytime I watch dylan review a movie, it fundamentally changes how i feel about it. I hate you. Cant wait for the next one!
Dylan pleaseeeeee watch BROTHER BEAR
Mi si è fermato il cuore quando ha detto il mio nome 😍❤️
I have watched the "is that a shotgun? Oh it's just an umbrella, thank God OH NO" six times and I don't think I can stop 🤣
I think there was a good amount of romance considering its a kids movie
mice and rats can be cute
“if i dont like it, i dont swallow” dylan: should i say it? i should say it. weeell maybe not 25:38
I love when Dylan eats his words 😂
seriously want Dylan to react Monster House
IT'S A CRIME IF HE DIDN'T WATCH THE CREDITS. that part was my favorite as a kid
wow a disney plus video without any complaints about spacebar problems good job Dylan!
I think she liked Jacque because he seen something beautiful and incredible in a place, and in a rat at that, when others would’ve never dared. I think it’s more so his intentions and heart she fell for because when he started becoming egotistical and a dick she didn’t like him as much as
Dylan, I was having a lovely day NOT thinking about the horrendous creatures moose are smh
This rat slander!
6:24 - i honestly feel like she wouldn't shoot him or even use the gun, but then ofc he had to challenge her, so yeah. as a woman, that's exactly what i would do. i may not even want to do anything, but if you challenge me I'll do it just because you had the guts to say i wouldn't, so now i will.
An old woman with a shotty - in Paris - and gas mask trying to take down rats like they're muggers  6:25 And this man is painting a naked lady!  This is the Pixar I miss
the fact that i found out that Pierre and Jacque are not their actual names when i watched the movie on my own 😭  like i fr thought they were actually their names thanks dylan 💀
Cesar salad recepie
Sooo...who's gonna tell him that there are no moose in France?
My guy😂I’m Alaskan. Moose are literally chill. They’re like bees. Don’t bother them and they won’t bother you. I’ve been within a few feet of some before and they’re very chill as long as you walk away
Why is it always a murder plot with Dylan?
everyone should watch your friend the rat it is very good its just a short
17:07 DONT GASLIGHT ME DYLAN
Just me rewatching old Dylan vids for comfort
Omg I love racacoonie
I thought I was going crazy with the rat being named pierre
Pierrre HAD ME ON THE FLOOR
he said "do you see the excitement on his face??" after the hair-pulling thing and i had the exact same thought run through my head when colette pinned linguine's sleeve with her knives
7:39 ???? 😭😭😭 LMFAOO IHY DYLAN
Linguini showing Remy his apartment for the first time is the same as Aladdin showing place his to Jasmine 😂
"The 😮 my GAWD 🤨 the French are wild people" 😂😂😂
7:11 that is the face of a man who has become extremely aware of how disgustingly aroused he became in that scene.
"Fun fact" from a parisian girl: ratatouille is indeed a real dish AND the shop with the dead rats really exists and is one of the oldest in Paris
"Dead rats hang in the window of the Aurouze pest-control shop in Paris. They've been hanging there since 1925. In a key scene from "Ratatouille," the father of RRémy, a rat who wants to be a chef, shows him a pest-control shop and tells him humans" that is real btw
oh my gosh!!! this video is so good❤😅❤😊 que 😅❤
You: it would be too hard... to read- Me: this is a weird unrelated- is this an a You: a physical book Me: AUDIBLE AD  I love me
Okay but listen this….live action ratatouille 👀
Fleas started the plague, but they did go onto rats
8:50 “a rats fist” will always make me ugly cry laugh 💀
Did dylan ever learn that the ratatouille in the movie isnt actually ratatouille. Its a different dish called confit byaldi
"his name is PEIERRE!!!" 2:42
6:03 You're too late. >:)  Domesticated rats are very clean and very intelligent! They make loving pets :)
15:24
“She likes it when people take it from her” THAT GOT ME
I wouldn't kill a mouse in my house, I'd bring it outside, if it's a spider though, that changes things for me.
"OMG he is me" .....😂 32:10 Love that
Dylan in almost every movie: wheres the death????? c'mon lets have some blood  Dylan when there is actually violence: WHAT WHY IS THERE SO MUCH VIOLENCE
this whole video is just like that one audio   miss rabbit has fainted miss rabbit fainted again  mixed with the one like  the man was too stunned to speak
No you don’t kill the mice or rats, you catch them and release them in a park or something. We have lots of empty fields wheee I live so it’s not hard to return them to nature Rats aren’t that gross. I mean Paris rats probably are but field mice are so sweet. I mean but don’t touch them 😂
I love how we never address the fact that the rats are literate.
Im watching this cause of my girl
It was rated G for guns
No one: Dylan: "This movie is so violent. Why is everyone so violent. There's so much violence." *Dude comes in and sees all the rats gathered together on the floor* "KILL HIM"
25:02 He did the laugh he hates from the He's all that commentary. 😂😂
25:37 - Dylan trying to figure out whether to make a dirty joke or let it go is everything lol.
I’ve been binge watching your videos to help me cope with a break up of an almost 2 year very intense realtionship which felt like 5 years.. it was the most serious relationship I’ve had.. we had a dog together.. which he kept because it was legally his.. it’s been 2 months and I just found out.. on December 25th.. Christmas Day.. that he has been in a relationship for 1 month or a bit less already… I’m a mess.. I was already before meeting him.. I didn’t think I could get my soul broken even more.. but here I am.. I’m completely devasted.. and feel betrayed and used.. I had so many doubts but now at least I know that I meant absolutely nothing to him
22:58 OKAY BUT I NEVER NOTICED HIS PUPIL CHANGE WHEN HE SAYS “POPULAR” WOAH
😂😮😊
This is a mecha movie. You can’t convince me wrong.
“Oh gran prob lives in America- WAIT NO WE’RE IN FRANCE”
Ooga booga
Dylan: questioning what he's good at.Also Dylan: Doing super smooth product placements.. Dylan: questioning what he's good at.Also Dylan: Doing super smooth product placements..
They don’t actually know how it started, but it JUMPED to rats. So while it isn’t believed they necessarily started it, it is believed they HEAVILY spread it.
I adore this movie! 🥰 🧀🐀 P.S. and, yes, I saw a little mouse in the previous house I lived in. I did not like that. 😁
The thing is I worked in food industry I always end up falling for a fiesty cook or server lol I’m a chef who ends up having to be the cook and helper
So sad that Dylan missed her glace down when being told about his little chief
G in France is PG13 in America 🤣
25:30 i can tell dylan wanted to say “thats what she said” here LMFAOOO
Todays lesson with Dylan… Just don’t think too much
Are we going to talk about iron trap vs steel trap?😂😂
As a Canadian I can confirm that moose are scary. You hit that sucker with your car adn you end up with more damage and that F-er can just walk away fine
How many times I have watched this video counter
Wait I realize why I love this movie so much, it's just a mecha story in disguise
“WHO GAVE THIS WOMAN A SHOTGUN??? …oh she’s probably in America”
Ratatouille is probably my favorite Pixar movie. It may not be as recognizable as some of their movies like Toy Story, Monsters Inc, or Finding Nemo. But it’s just so fun and creative, and it has a really great message to it. About how people with extraordinary talents can come from anywhere, and to follow your passions no matter how unlikely they may seem to the outside world. The film itself is truly a work of art and it’s hard to believe it was made less than 2 decades ago. It’s so sad to see Pixar loose their creativity in such a short amount of time.
I mostly saw this movie on the Disney Channel and MY GAAAHD they cut out so many of the crazy stuff that I BARELY recognize it when I watch it in full lol
7:15 - he's clearly turned on cuz violence is his kink lmao
I breed rats, and I’ve loved this movie growing up, I started owning rats when I was 7, breeding in 2020. Wild rats/mice, are still pests.
As a kid I used to think the rat was called ratatouille and i was really disappointed when i found out it wasn't
I showed this to my two younger cousin one new years eve while I was babysitting.... The part with the old lady shooting around haphazardly was the only part my aunt and uncle managed to watch before they left 😅😅😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢 It was very scary because my uncle was like "what are you showing my daughters?" I was just like, "I PROMISE THIS IS THE ONLY PART LIKE THIS!!!!!!" (context, it was my 'scary' uncle)  I laugh at it now because it's one of my cousins favorite movies now😂   Lol, just realized my aunt saw the "lovers quarrel/shooting" part, not the psycho shooting grandma part😅  Oh boy.😳
Dylan : "have you ever seen a Moose?!"  Every french person : "no, we have not. At most we've seen a dear and that's it"
dylan *shocked*: who gave this woman a shotgun?! *understanding*: Oh shes american *shocked again*: No wait shes french!! a true journey
Ratatouille, favorite pixar movie of all time, would still kill a rat on sight.
25:31 no way I didn't understand it before and only now I get it 😅😅😅
“I can’t see her liking him” you’d be surprised how blind love can actually be , where smokeshows fall for dorkdork#1
That old lady DEFINITELY fought in a war. I don’t care about historical accuracies, she kicked ASS
waiiiiit a minute… dylan is single ? 🤨
Fyi, for anyone wondering rats and pigeons themselves are incredibly clean and some of the best pets to get if you don't have the space or funds for dogs, cats, etc. They both can carry a plethora of diseases, but only if they've been living in filthy overpopulated conditions. Like the way salmonella is a filth problem, not one directly linked with chickens in general.
I always love when Dylan just randomly gets an existential crisis mid video
Wait in English the mouse’s name is Pierre???? In Portuguese is Remi wtf
4:05 as a French I can tell you that hunters families have shotgun at home (with a licence) so probably her dead husband had a shotgun and she kept it ?
13:20 audible
It's actually usual to see pest control stores hanging dead rats on the window in Paris. Disgusting but real.
baby boo
6:36 Dylan stop lying
I was gonna ask where the scene that remy eats a bunch of carnival food is but that’s literally form charlottes web
“A rat’s fist of” is my new favorite unit of measurement 😂 lmaoooo
27:46 bro that's exactly why she fell in love with him, he goofy
is dylan watching this in canada or something, I don't remember the hanging rats scene lmfao
"this woman is squarnfull"😭😭😭😭
Don’t mean to disrespect but he looks like if Adam from the Goldbergs grew up irl
That scene of the couple was so unhinged
7:05  I got a gun safety ad right here 😭
I like how got every name wrong
I think the coolest part of the movie is that all the humans look like rats
2:43 the amount of times I rewatch this is just stupid
Dylan has an unhealthy.. liking for villainous or dangerous women.. Hella, Ursela and niw Collette
Shotguns have 5 shots per reload MOST OF THE TIME, she fired I want to say 7 or 8 before reloading. That's firearms round inaccuracy... -1 point movie (in all seriousness I love the film, this was just a pointer)
Pierre is my favorite nepo baby
Why does Dylan kind look like the red headed dude
real. I didn't know mooses were so huge
that "if I don't love it, I don't swallow" hits different when you're old enough to understand lmao 25:30
Dylan has no right to deny his violence kink after this movie
*woman tries to k*ll rats (**04:05**)* Dylan: Oh no! Girl! That’s the not the right weapon! Holy crap! This woman is a psycho! Who gave this woman a gun?! 😨 oh, she’s probably in America 😌. No! This is France! 😭 what is this woman doing with a shotg*n!? 😂
dylan...I have 2 pet rats...
I think we need to address the fact that the secondary main character of this movie is named Cream Sauce Flat Pasta  Edit: 6:07 Dylan, if I see a mouse in my house, I’m screaming and running as fast as I possibly can away from it
If I heard a rat made the food I have to go at least once
Does anyone else see Jack Horner from Puss in Boots 2 inside of Dylan. Both just love death...btw great movie you should watch it
I will now be using "a rats fist" as a measurement
i really liked one joke you said in this video, but the rest of them fell flat. be better dylan
Ugh... Dylan... Boy... How do you make everything sound either morbid or sexy (or both) in EVERY. SINGLE. VIDEO?
32:05  HAHAHAH this is so funny for no reason
if i am killed for simply living, let death be kinder than man. and god, please let the deer on the highway get some kind of heaven something with tall soft grass and sweet reunion let the moths in the porch lights go some place with a thousand suns, that taste like sugar and get swallowed whole. may the mice in oil and glue have forever dry, warm fur and full bellies. i pray nobody kills me for the crime of being small.
It wasn't Saved by the Bell! Yes the would freeze frame in SBTB but the "bet you're wondering" thing wasn't used. It was used in Quantum Leap but I dont think that's where it originated
Me: *Drinks Coca-Cola*  Dylan: "Oh no. Guess there's a new king in town. AND HIS NAME IS - PIERRE~!!!"  Me: "PFFT!" *Soda leaves through nose* "ARGH! LIFE IS MISERY AND PAIN! WHY DO I THIS TO MYSELF?!"  ...  *Sips soda*
Movie is based in France  Reactor won’t shut up about the mob and doing Italian mob impressions
him yelling "KILL HIM!" when the health inspector arrived killed me 🤣
After watching this video, I had a dream that a man named Jacque yelled at me for pronouncing the "s" in his name
I once had a mouse come out of my wall and I captured him and took him outside so my cat wouldn't eat him. He attacked me because I was scared and I had to go get a shot to make sure I didn't catch anything from him. I regret nothing and I would do it again ❤
As French i have to say then la ratatouille is a dish very common and we don’t have guns in France but maybe we broke a few plates or hit with pans but no guns please it’s american 😭
Ratatouille reminds Ego of his childhood because its not usually made that fancy. It was made as a jumble of vegetables, I know cause as a chef I've cooked both the poor version and fancy (fancy uses the same ingredients but just displays very thin delicately placed cuts)
'A rat's fist' will never not be funny.
dylan was lowkey scared for his life in here 3:57 and 4:00
Loved how he spent the whole video dumping on Linguini only to realise he sees himself in the character
The rats name is REMMMYYYYY
was dylan annoyed at that one female chef talking about how she's the only woman in the kitchen? Is he one of those guys??? Please say no.
Wrong country Dylan. Get it right.
Dylan normally: where’s the murder  Also Dylan: stop the violence
Brain 2 calculated.akready
3201 he saw already
He no wah be focus I mn planned out
Je cn avt .act as o.the o 465 days boys
My fav pixar movie*_*
“oh shes probably in america” stop im peeing myself
pierre😭😭😭😭😭😭
25:31 we were all thinking it
Does this guy ever figure out the rats name is remy
The fact that the dead rat shop is real and still around baffles me
Not Dylan missing the penis joke when Linguini says “I have a tiny… little…” and the chick looks down. I know he made the penis joke himself, but it’s just funny the way she does it 😂
I didn’t love Ratatouille when it came out as a kid, and I am now only realising it’s bc of how violent it was lmao. I was the “fairies, princesses and barbie” kid, so dead rats and gun violence wasn’t my thing ahaha
Wait, what is the toilet paper comment? Isn’t the toilet paper always next to the toilet? I’m confusion 🤔
about mooses... They're adorable and peaceful creatures, but you really shouldn't pet them as they're rarely pest free. 😬 Also, before you ask, yes. I have seen multiple mooses. Very close up I might add! They're everywhere here.
Seriously first time I'm ever commenting on a youtube video, but I legit laughed out loud so many times at your commentary. "He's a goofball and got no talent. Omg he's me!". Killed me. You're so funny and handsome.
6:03 I once chased down and picked up a wild mouse in my house with my bare hands like a cat and this movie is one of my favorites. So... does that answer your question?
No one is safe from Gusteau's jump scares!😂
Pierre Ritler
Dylan… you’re worried about MOOSE?! I thought you said GOOSE and, as a Canadian, I was like “Yes! 100% geese are the worst”.  But no… you’re worried about moose
I love the fact that Collette do say that nobody listens to her because she is, well, a woman. Even though she is really talented. The only one who listens, gives her the deserved atention and THANKS for her advices is Linguini. When he doesn't follow them, she later finds out it's Remi who doesn't want to. Maybe that's why she fell for him, Dylan kkkkk. He is the only one who cares and doesn't take her for granted.
29:41 i think it was shown earlier, even in dylans video, when remy and the guy moved into a new home and cristina was there skating with him
25:31 ;)
5:17 Dylan what??
When Dylan yelled, "OH NO!" bc the shotgun and continued to rant. I DIED OF LAUGHTER.
Finally someone else who was shook by the casual attempted domestic murder 😂
Dylan was lookin fine as hell with that white jacket and gold chain. He betta stop it 🤤👏🏽
A “rats throw of pepper” is now an official measurement
I thought bro bought a whole chef costume just for this video from the thumbnail now imagine my shock when I realized he was wearing a normal white shirt lmao
Dylan: "Movie studious just want to put so much violence in their films.  I'm always like: stop with the violence, alright? I'm sick of seeing it. The world is already filled with too much violence, I certainly don't want it in my media."   next recommended video:  Dylan Is In Trouble : "*Despicable Me* doesn't have enough death"   -_- bro
The plague did start because of rats ☺️
Cool Video - by the way the creepy dead rat store really exists in Paris! Yuck 🤢
Damn Dylan really wants to be dominated huh
"his name is Pierre" Bro, they legit say he is Remy
Dylan gaslighting us into believing Remy’s name is Pierre for 33 minutes
honestly, i think its best that he DIDNT learn roller skating from here and is already good at it. Shows that he actually is more skilled than we gave him credit for, he just was in the wrong area the whole time.
I’m soooo sad that the audible link doesn't work in Canada! 😭😭
Dud
That industrial dishwasher would have all but boiled those rats if this weren't a cartoon 🌡
The Road to El Dorado ? Video Coming soon
whilst i was watching this my cat brought a rat into the house. he came in with it and starred at my mum until she saw him, when my mum saw him she shouted and he ran upstairs towards my bedroom i heard so i slammed my door shut and he dropped the rat and ran all the way outside. it was so gross i had to get a dog poo picker and pick it up and i gently put it into the large shrubs of bushes in my garden.  just thought it was a weird coincidence because he never has done this before, with a rat atleast
Terrible fact for everyone! That rat store at 20:25 is real! That’s a real place! That really hangs those bodies like that! It’s insane!
whaaat how has he not seen this movie until now??!!!
I’m going to start using “a rats fist” as a measurement 😂
i can’t with the fact that no one notices the man painting n4ked women before the gun scene 6:25
bro is like "why is this movie so violent!?" but all of his title are like <insert movie name here> DOESNT HAVE ENOUGH DEATH or  <insert movie name here> DOESNT HAVE ENOUGH VIOLENCE 🤣🤣🤣
dylan is too smooth with his advertising
I love mice and I’m going to study biology next year so… the only thing I’m killing in my house is a mosquito.
29:35 actually "Jacque" thought "Christina" how to skate in one of the sequences after they fired the boss. Throughout the movie they showed that "Jacque" have great balance with his skating, and biking and he is also attentive with how he can guess what "Pierre" is thinking by his body language. Making him the perfect waiter.
I do think that it's smart that pixar put a rat as the main character, because this movie is meant to challenge our biases about artists and their origins. And to show a rat in the kitchen and have the audience root for it to share it's culinary talents. Instead of just an underdog human which we are already wired to root for because of media that we're used to.
Petition to change every recipe that calls for "a pinch" of salt/pepper to be changed to "a rat's fist"
I love this movie with all my heart. This commentary was so good 😂
I'm french, if you have any questions I'll be happy to answer because this movie didn't portrait french very well
The boy meet world comment was a fact
“ Turtles ? “ 😂
i love that every movie dylan watches he finds a woman to swoon over
If you loved the cinematography in this film then watch Encanto.
I love that every time Dylan reacts to a movie he has to Google’s something at least once
since I live in the countryside, door mice and field mice are pretty much everywhere but when I see an alive mouse in my house (normally they're dead cos I have a murderous cat) I just put them back outside.  Enough of the mouse population has been killed outside my bedroom door...
omg, my boyfriend actually thought Remy's name was Ratatouille and was so SURE about it, so confident. when I told him otherwise, he was so disappointed in the movie lol. he had a lot of complaints XD now he deliberately calls Remy Ratatouille out of spite.
Lol, I love how he even calls himself out on shit in his own video. XD
pierre ratler ratman 😭
Ratatouille is one of seven movies I paid for on YouTube to own forever but yes, if I see a mouse or rat in my house, it’s either me or it
16:50 😂
A rat's throw of pepper is a regular measurement of mine now
As someone with pet rats. I’m half offended and half amused. Good work
Me for the first 3/4 of the video: “Why is he calling the rat Pierre?! That is not his name! You know that’s not his name right??” Me 20 minutes in: “oh it’s a joke. Heh heh. Funny.”
13:28 I have never laughed at a sponsorship announcement. until now!
As a pest control specialist. I know it's a fact that rats don't have a gag reflex. But it is a kids movie made by Disney. So nothing is ever gonna make sense.
I remember watching this movie when it came out in cinemas but I don't remember that much shooting and dead rats bodies
11:57
You paused and took it in when she was like knifing his sleeves  😂 YOU horndoggin!!! DYLAN!!!!!!
Just found Dylan and I have been binge watching! Also he has some kinks! 😏😏👀 Lol I love it
This movie is sponsored by PETA so humans can see how cruel they are.
What’s up with the edit on this video Dylan lol you point it out so often, I can’t under it when you do it
Now that I think about it Ratatouille is full of masochists and Dylan became one too 💀
throughout this video i kept getting disappointed that he was cutting out clips that i like because i could literally recite this movie from memory, i think what i really want is to just watch ratatouille
25:36this is why i fucking love u dylan 😭😭
Pretty sure rats didn’t start disease they just spread juman diseases, so actually humans are more diseased :[
I just found this channel and it perfectly resonates with my humour
Dylan talking about the Italian mob, then saying rely is French and names him Pierre bc of this, then proceeds to call him Pierre the entire movie but reverts to assuming the movie is in Italy….
The staff were kinda justified to leave. Pierre is a health code violation
The transition into these sponsors kills me every time 🤣
I’d put the mouse outside or pretend I didn’t see it.
10:53 his tiny apartment is a normal size apartment in France
I realized at the end of the video that Dylan actually gaslighted me to think Pierre was Remy’s name
You should watch the good dinosaur, it has something that no other Disney film has.
You often give this point like in 5:43, I would really like You to watch "Give up on Your Dreams of Becoming a Baker" by Brian David Gilbert, it is very short video but it is amazing
The plague killed around 200 million people, 50% of Europe’s population were dead, because of rats….
Moose. Terrorists of the woods.
Remy gotta be autistic bc his deep understanding of food for a rat is insane. Such a good nose,heart, and brain. Very sweet character
I literally just saw a TikTok yesterday about this movie.  The rat stole a recipe book at the beginning of the film, right? Well, that book could be Ego's mother's old recipe book. This is why he liked it, got a flashback about his mother and walked away without saying anything!  Now, I don't know if this is true, but it does sound pretty cool.
I laughed way too hard at “This movie is raged G for guidance.”
You're slipping Dylan. No one is gonna believe you're a 20-year-old man with maturity like that. 25:36
great video but i watched it with my pet rat and he told me he found some out what you said rlly offensive. like that rats are dirty? he takes six showers a day. and he finds it insulting that you don’t think rats have the capacity to cook
Fun fact: That rat-hanging shop actually exists in Paris ✨The more you know✨
Do books float ?? 😂😂😂
22:05 25:30
Dylan pleading for LESS violence in a movie is not something I ever thought I'd see, and while watching a Pixar movie no less lmao
3:56 "Is that a shotgun?? Oh, it's an umbrella. Oh thank God. OOHHH NOOOOOOO!!!!" The comedic timing on that couldn't be more perfect lol
"I'm not a math or science and literature person......what am I good at?"  So relatable
you look spanish
15:31 hehe dyan being turned on by knife weilding woman....and before than a gun weilding woman.....he sure got some violent kinks XD.
oh you sly bastard, that transition to the ad was incredible
Wait!!!! You're single?  Not possible.
6:04 Who tf kills a mice? Unless it's like a _huge_ infestation, a whole colony living in your cellar or something... but normally, just use a live trap. It's not that hard. If you saw where it went you can catch it with a boot or something and just put it back in nature.
you have to watch outer banks, you will love it i promise
6:40 yeah uh-uh sounds like Dylan to me
4:#4 Thank you we needed that reminder. Moose = DANGER
the shop with all the rats hanging actually exists in Paris, always nice when you pass by lol
im glad dylan likes this movie bc i loooove it
As someone who lives in the countryside, mice are pretty common. I scooped up one in my dog’s food once, and I didn’t realize until I poured it into the bowl. Luckily by the time I can back when I ran away it was gone. We set traps sometimes but mostly they’re not a huge bother.
fun fact, the reason the critic loved the ratatouille is because it's the recipe from the book Remy stole from his grandma's (mom's?) house- which, if you pay attention, you can see when he has a flashback to his childhood. if i'm not mistaken, also she wears the same dress still.
Dylan being flabbergasted by the old lady shooting at the rats in her house cracked me up. That scene reminded me of my Grandma. She shot a hole in her wall years ago trying to get a snake that came up out of her toilet...this is in Aus mind you sooo 😂
I didn’t watch this one yet but all these cartoon reactions r u just watching my childhood for the first time 😅😂 even zootopia is in my heartz!
I have eight pet rats 😅
no i just... don't kill mice, or rats, even spiders, don't particularly think I'm into that, I'd call someone if i was having mice problems probably
Rack focus more like RAT focus....ill leave
Holy shit that was a smooth transition into a sponser
Actually hamsters were worse plague carriers than rats
3:59 that part had me dying!! 12:19 "what am I good at?" I wonder that a lot🤣 15:38 I stan Collette 19:26 "I forgot he had a family" 🤣that's funny 22:52 🤣🤣🤣 32:10 "he's me"🤣 33:50 turtles instead of tootles?🤣
I can't with Dylan simping for the girl so hard 😆
Genuinely enjoyed this video, but as a proud rat owner of two Wheaten Burmese rats, I really hated how he kept dissing rats and calling them disgusting and disease ridden (even if it was jokes) because they're actually very clean
Dylan says no violence then wants the rats to die lmaoooo
Dylan, why are you doing an italian accent lmao
Sapient beings being killed on mass in animated kids movies is a common messed-up fact about the movie's animated universe.
His name is Remi  not peaier
If that movie scarred you.... then you got issues, problems, etc. Go admit yourself into mental asylum indefinitely.....
His reaction to Collette being intimidating is so funny. I love it when he is attracted to fictional animated characters. XD
The scene with the dead rats in the shop window is actually based on a real-life shop that exists (or existed at the time of the movie) in France.
20:58 This is literally the plot of Bee Movie
i swear every ad read is so freaking seamless
DYLAN PLEASE GIVE ME A CHANCE UR SO FINEEEEE
Dylan calling Remy "Pierre" for the entirety of this movie is what frustrated me the most lmao (or how us french say it "mdr")
So, LETS DO THIS THING!  Slams the door open and Instantly regrets it 😂
ok but think about how fun an au wherein remy is a demon possessing linguini but literally the only thing he does is cook would be  that or an au wherein remy is just a cryptid who can control ppl's bodies to an extent
I love how in the sponsorship part he asks, "you wanna listen to Twilight?" In my head I said, hell yeah! But I should have expected immedient judgment😂
"if you see a mouse in your house you're gonna kill it right?"  me: *looks over to my pet mice* "you heard the man"
Wait, he is single? Want to go on a date? 😅
can you do Avatar 2 the way of water
Dylan, pls react to 'Boys Don't Cry' with H. Swank and make some jokes about the r- -pe scene how she deserved it , how she's a lil bltch for not fighting back more
Dylan, pls react to 'Boys Don't Cry' with H. Swank and make some jokes about how you hope the r- -pe scene would be harder and
Hold on your SINGLE?!! In my head your in a 4 year relationship
Who tf are Jacques and Pierre?!
Luca next! And do a French accent during that movie hahah
Damn I can’t concentrate on the movie when his smile makes me wanna 🥴😩😫
I made a bet with my sister saying “I bet you he’ll find the shotgun lady sexy” and at the very end of the scene, he said it!😂
COMEDY!!!!
3:55  "Is that a shotgun?" *realizes* "oh it’s a-oh thank god.. *women pulls out a shotgun* "OH NOO”
« Is this french culture ? » yes.
"Colette?? I was so close... Christina"💀  Dylan and names, perhaps not a better love story than twilight
dylan please for the love of god do knives out
Pls watch not okay on Hulu
Not me 22 minutes into the vid realizing that his name is not Pierre 🤦🏽‍♀️
I need Dylan to watch „flushed away“ pleaaaase
Fun fact: I saw this in theaters and got violently ill. Still do. 🤷🏼‍♂️
That has been the smoothest intro he has done to a sponsor. Great
I don't know how I got here but this was the funniest movie review EVER. Immediately subscribed to this channel.
His face when Jacque is like "BC I LOVE YOU.. rrr.."  "IF I DON'T LOVE IT, I DON'T SWALLOW." Dylan: *questions if he should tell the joke* Me: Do it. We already know what you're thinking.
… when I had mice in my house my fiancé and I did set them free in a park across a river….. and named the one in the kitchen Remi….. even considered keeping them as pets….😅
I gotta be honest I've actually never used Dylan's audible links before (I mean I click on it, I just never use it;  same with just about every youtuber). But for some reason, this time I decided use the text option this time and boy was that easy and simple. Now time to be a basic ass bitch and listen to Jeanette McCurdy's book 😁 Thanks Dylan... Peace!
When he went on a website about making a food float😂😂
Bro he taught her how to roller skate
6:03 well, I have pet rats so I might be a little biased there I do remember as a kid I was in bed and heard a tiny squeak. I knew a mouse fell into the mouse trap my grandma has set up. And, oh, boy, did I have the urge to rescue it back then. However, I did not end up doing that cause of my grandma but I feel a little sad looking back at it.
dylan makes me roll my eyes and then smile
Not dylan catching onto all of disney's hidden meanings lmfao
i seem to be the only one disturbed by the ring around Dylans bubble
randomly nicknaming her christina is peak steins gate energy
Dylan u reacted to stranger things season 1 and 2 like 4 years ago and never did seasons 3 and 4. I would love to see you watch the latest seasons since its almost over and season 5 will be the last one. Idk if u want to watch it but i personaly would love to see it.
You should watch boy meet world!
Funfactct this movie is my childhood trauma
you would need me to watch someone sanitize the rat over 100 times, watch it cook and give YOU food to eat and give me over 10 billion before i’m eating from a rat.
Okay but did that villian just make an spit and swallow joke lol
Well I mean Lion King was G and there was two murders lol
Watch the summer I turned pretty
All I have to say is, your videos are amazing. Having the capacity to break down something so simple as Ratatouille and analyse it with such detail that it becomes an art piece is incredible. Doing this all through comedy is simply unbelievable, as you have the position to teach people about your passion and knowledge, while also entertaining them. I've come to the conclusion that you are one of the best content creator out there. You have a unique style, and form, that YouTube needs more off.
REMY HIS NAME IS REMY THE RAT WHO THE FUCK IS PIERRE
bruh moose aint no joke ....look in too em they walking behemoths that dont play around you get taken off the census asap if they feel like it
Bro you cant be asking why youre single with a face like that. Its just offensive. 🥲❣
Dylan: what if she loves the rat not the human! me: have you watched bee movie yet 👀👀
I just realized why the relationship between Colette and Linguini works 😳 😳 😳.  Colette tells us that the reason she is the only woman in the kitchen is because she is the toughest chef in Gusteau's. Speculating a little bit we can imagine that in a field dominated by men she was able to be at the top by believing only on herself, because she knew that nobody would lend her a hand to achieve her dreams. As later said by Ego, "The world is often unkind to new talent, new creations. The new needs friends", and that's Linguini, a friend who would risk everything to defend a rat dreams and his skills. Colette sees in Linguini a kind person that will listen attentively to her advises and will believe in her talents as a chef.  I also didn't bought their relationship at first, but now that I think about it, is making a lot more sense. Also great reaction :)
Dylan’s face when Colette was stabbing the knives in Linguini’s sleeve was hilarious. Like, why was he so turned on?!?! 😂
I never realized on violent this movie is wow lol
LOL OMG Dylan you are wonderful lmbo i freaking lovee these videos
Contrary to popular belief, rats don't like to be dirty and will groom themselves often to keep clean. Even more than a cat would. The only place that's arguably unclean are their tails which is understandable given it's hard for them to reach.
Nice ❤️
Watch the whole Wednesday season!
12:08. the bubonic plague started because of fleas on the rats. the rats were on a ship that came to europe and then the fleas that were on the rats which carried the disease bit humans and the plague started spreading.
i watched this together with my rat and you managed to offend him so many times, he’s not happy about it
the "what am I good at" got me
6:34 you know hes actually thinking "i love this movie 100% more now"
This movie just makes me think of Everything Everywhere All At Once now. Which you needddd to do a video on
Also yes it's the french. They just be attacking you for no reason lmfao I know by experience lmao
an adult moose can be 6'9 weigh 1,500 pounds and run 35 mph. Yes that's TERRIFYING
15:35 His reaction 🤭😏
did he just refer to a grandma as sexy
Your videos are saving my christmas
This movie has alot of deleted scenes, because brad bird was forced to make the movie under two hours
a rats fist😭
Dylan we were getting along fine before the saved by the bell comment 😂😂😂 SBTB walked so boy meets world could run 🤦🏽‍♀️
If he hasn't already, he should watch "The Sea Beast". It's a great film.
He’s always been good at it
Every time Dylan reacts to a film from my childhood, I get nostalgic and want to watch again
You should watch the first and the last episode of alice in borderland (yesterday the second season was released)
Please do zombies
He is wearing mr incredible underwear 11:45
Why does Dylan kinda look like Randy (Jamie Kennedy) when he was in Scream 2?? Am I wrong? Look it up and see for yourself
PLEASE do a movie commentary on Elf. one of my all time favorite movies
These comments are gold! 😂
I hope you have Coco, 2017 on your list of Disney movies to watch - you'll love it!!
Listen, if I find a wild rat, no i will not touch it, but I wont kill it! Just trap and release it somewhere farther away, and there are domestic rats who are actually very clean!!! Theyre not all dirty!
dylan needs to do the first and last episode of Jane the Virgin!
Y'all he needs to watch Into The Woods that would be hilarious
So no one's gonna talk about the fact that dylan thought remy's name was pierre.
REACT TO AOT PLS
hi! i love your videos! i just noticed that you've never watched encanto and i think that you would really like it!
So Jack have a inheritance of a super popular restaurant in Paris and in a matter of weeks he lost all the staff and the restaurant closed due to sanitation problems. Not only that, but also he destroy the career of one of the best food critics in town. He is really a fool. This is not a happy ending. Is infuriating and gross.
The Princess and The Frog next!!!!
i dated a guy named remi once
Please watch the hateful eight good tarintino movie
The weird, creepy, disturbing shop actually exists in Paris  Can't remember the name but it is real! And there also are some shops that taxidermy the mice, put them in close and place them just like little dolls
The movie had me up until the scene where all of the rats go into the kitchen lmao. Remy, sure. It's an inspiring story and what's the thing that you never want to see in a kitchen? A rat. It's metaphorical, of course. He obviously likes to cook, and in this cartoon kids movie, he can also talk, so let's say he knows of proper sanitization lmao, but ALL of the rats? The ones that we established to enjoy the garbage and be filthy because "that's who they are?" I thought that that scene was just a little meh lol but at least they acknowledged that the restaurant got shut down because of them lol.
what's going on? where are the likes on this masterpiece? i waitd for so long for this one, is like a miracle.. wonder if he will ever do Coraline ~ this is not a recommendation x)(
Boy meets world was definitely better than saved by the bell
Actually Dylan, I have found mice before in my house and I caught them in a humane trap and let them go outside lol
Dylan is my mood.
Dylan: If you find a rat in your kitchen Me who has found three dead rats in our home kitchen (that doubles as a laundry room) because they fell into a bucket of chlorine for the last three weeks: 😀
dylan while you're on your disney kick PLEASE watch Brave also please watch the new stranger things seasons :)
reaction the movie Rio
seeing them rats run around the kitchen took me outtt lol I had the game on PlayStation it was lowkey intense
A movie that entertains Dylan is always better than a movie that bores him. Dylan is incredibly knowledgeable and hilarious.
can you react to murder mystery?
I love rats and mice, they are adorable. I don't know how people can kill them like flies.They are like tiny cats or bunnies.
dylan pls watch wednesday on netflix pass
So I'm a servsafe manager and currently manage a small bakery, but back at my first job when I was 16 we had a serious rodent issue. We would find them dead on sticky traps every morning, and if they were still alive we would soak them in warm soap water to get them off of the glue trap before setting it free.  But one day the opening manager went to wheel the soup out of the walk in, and found the lid askew (nothing in the walk in was ever sealed properly, they were only covered with loose cambro lids). She went to check the soup to find a mouse had gotten into the soup and drowned overnight.  She sent a picture to the manager group chat and was immediately chewed out by the owners wife for sharing it, as she didn't want it to get out amongst the employees. Naturally it did.  Later I found out that they sold the soup, and that the manager was instructed by the owners wife to scoop it out and sell the rest of the soup at a discount so they didn't lose any money...  Suffice to say I quit shortly after, they stole $300 out of my final paycheck and threatened to go after me if I didn't let it go, and that's the story of why I'll never be able to watch Remy make his soup the same way again.
"I have trouble with literature" Dylan...we know
dylan makes the kind of content i watch at like 2am when i’m sleep deprived but still refuse to sleep. and i love that.
Fun fact: Rats are cleaner than most rodents. One of the cleanest in fact. They spend lots of time grooming and cleaning themselves. You are more likely to get sick from your cat (that literally shits and pisses in a box they stand and walk in) than a well groomed rat. Also rats are great pets and can be trained much like a dog.
dylan talking about how he wished there was a scene of colette skating with linguini when there literally is one at 24:28 is so funny to me for absolutely no reason
Excuse me! When will you react to HTTYD 2?? 😭
Do a first and last episode of Boy Meets World pleaseeeee
Ok listen I know you don’t talker suggestions and get annoyed by them but im gonna go against that and I really really recommend under the skin with scarlet Johansson
This movie is the reason why I love apples/cheese and strawberry/cheese. I wanted to see the colors like Remi 😭
rAt_ta_tEWey Aah 🤣
Somebody told me that Remy's (or Pier, if you will) ability to make ratatouille that reminds Ego of his childhood is because Remy accidentally stole the recipe book from Ego's mom's house at the prologue scene, and my life has never been the same..
I love dylan's video, I now find myself when watching movies thinking 'oh this would be fun to watch dylan react', especially with shitty movies when he would roast the hell out of them, or I start critiquing the camera work and stuff. Love his videos!
i love how dylan invented names for the characters and stuck with it throughout the entire movie😂😂
start a podcast pleaseeee
8:40 I never noticed how he threw only a little bit of ingredients to fix a huge pot.
I watched almost all early to mid 2000s Pixar movies and I love them all! Cars is my favorite.
20:08 Movie ratings have always been weird, nudity, which is the most natural thing on Earth, is more censored than violence for some reason. Many have asked why it's like that.
Hello Dylan, Im a big fan of yours. I'm making a fan film, and I dont know if you've seen the VHS series, but it is a found footage horror series. I'm collaborating with other YouTubers, and I wanted to ask you because you seem knowledgeable about film. Also since each VHS film has 3 to 5 segments, we are hoping for 3 to 4 segments, I'm making 1, another YouTuber has made one, and another YouTuber is making one. So we are reaching out to youtube channels that enjoy horror, and asking if they want to make a segment and be apart of the movie. Only rules are that it has to be found footage, and it has to be horror obviously. Also gotta follow the basic rules of YouTube.
Dylan idk if your gonna see this but not asking you to make a movie commentary on it but I think you'll get spooks and maybe freaked out but I could recommend "incident in a ghost town" it's a pretty good movie
there is a lot of misinformation about rats, they're actually not as dirty as you think they are and if you had one as a pet its hygiene is at the same level as that of a domesticated cat or dog.
You should react to knives out
You cannot imagine the joy when I spotted this video on my start page, it‘s one of my childhood movies!!
This movie is hands down the best pixar movie of them all
your next movie commentary should be outer banks!!🙏🏻🙏🏻
i’ve never seen dylan enjoy a movie so much 😭💀 he was invested in the characters, the film style, he was laughing at all the out of pocket jokes 😩
Man, I love seeing Dylan love movies 😂!
Powerful women seem to like dopey guys they dont have to try and impress 🤷🏻‍♀️
Anyone else see the painting💀?? Like isn’t it a naked woman????
So can we call Dylan a "him" again??   I thought he was a girl now?  What the hell? he's a ganister I guess.
could you react to Pearl, please
dylan the sub
you can tell he is american bc he doesn’t know the difference between italy and france
Can you watch first and last episode of Game of Thrones?
21:54 THE POSE AND THE 'ooh' TOOK ME OUTTTTTT💀
You’re so cute 😅😊
Idk if anyone has mentioned anything about this but I just can't get over the fact that because Dylan doesn't know food industry protocols he doesn't get why the chef skinner quickly retrieved back to the kitchen when he realized he just entered the hall screaming and looking unhinged in front of the costumer.  It doesn't matter what happens in the kitchen, the costumer mustn't be distributed. That's it, what's why they always wait to be behind the kitchen doors to drop on he facade of "chill and professional" that we all gotta put when working in front of costumer.  And because of that he just missed some very important nuances of the film 😅 idk, just thought it's interesting. I am always so surprised when people are clueless about this things, i think it says a lot about their character.  Anyway, as always, a fun watch
he's the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!
There's a conspiracy theory that Gusteau was also controlled by a rat - and when the rat died, his michelin star was removed
Dylan always talks about death and violence there it is.😂😅
love your videos! they allways make me feel better, thank you for that <3 also, can you do a survey of which country your followers are from? I want to know if there's any other troublemakers or boogis in my country ;)
I'm too high for this 🤣🤣
Regarding the rifle: it looks like a hunting rifle, my theory is that it belongs to the dead husband. In France, as in Italy, when a sporting arms permit holder dies in order to keep the rifles legally, it is necessary for a relative to take the arms permit and recognize the rifles as his own. However, I don't know if the grandmother went through all these steps…
I have actually had a mouse sneak into our kitchen and I named him Remi. We eventually found his way in and blocked it, never killed him. He and I had some bonding in the ten minutes I spent locked in the kitchen trying to get him out the back door. My mom wouldn’t let me sleep otherwise.
Watch Smile it is the best horror movie I've ever seen!!
im begging you to watch the star wars prequels!
That segway was beautiful.
Don’t sell yourself short, we all love a goofball with no talent 😉
What worries me is the possibility that Dylan hasn't seen most of these movies. Like how???
YOU NEED TO WATCH EUPHORIA!!!
4:18 she's probably in America it's okay *remembers* Wait she's in France never mind😅
Who wants to see Dylan doing a naked gun reaction??
Oh but Dylan, we women like idiot goofballs with no talent. They're adorable to us
This is one of my favourite movies ever!
WHY DID YOU OPEN THIS BY ATTACKING THE MAFIA
Please react to wakanda forever when released
To be fair, Remi (the rat) by having an amazing scent probably has no desease cause he knows how to avoid them.   I agree with that the love aspect of the film is the weakest element of it
Please do cars 2 there’s DEATH!!!
can u please do a movie commentary on step up!
If you have to know one thing about Paris is that there are a lot of rats in this city. Like A LOT. For 1 Parisian, there are 3 rats. And yes, Paris is a small city with many inhabitants. Just go to the Eiffel tower by night, the romantic walk can quickly turn into a Survivor episode 😂😂
Dylan i have a suggestion, you should watch (full series) Only Murders in a building starring Selena Gomez and two other old people, (idk their names). It's like a murder mystery show, i liked it but some portions were like umm... Wth is this!?! I think you'd enjoy it. Love the vids!!! Thanks for entertaining me for these past couple of months. I've just recently started a marathon, watching all the commentaries.
Apparently that shop where they show dead rats in the window is a real place too.
dylan: *constantly asking for violence in movies* dylan when violence in movies: WHY IS THIS SO VIOLENT????
Dylan the mouse form Zootopia has seeped into your soul. That's where you got the mob thing from. I love it because I remember in that video you said you weren't a fan of god father references, and this is now the second non-zootopia video where you've inadvertently referenced it.
Fleas spread the plague.😂😂😂
Every time I see this movie now all I think of is Raccacoonie
YOU SHOULD WATCH SMILE THE HORROR MOVIE!!!!
It jsut hit me the hole remy is watching the couple witht he gun fight through is another bullet hole meaning they’ve done this befor
Slowly but steadily I’m taking notes on Dylan kinks
Would love to see Dylan’s reaction to The Santa Clauses series on Disney Plus👌🏻😂
The rat that carried the plague is called the rattus rattus - or black rat, while the other type of rat which is the ancestor of pet rats and which doesn't carry the disease is called rattus norwegicus, the brown rat (not necessarily brown coloured, but bigger than the black rat). I'd say he is a brown rat, based by his size in relation to the human, also his general friendliness - black rats are less friendly
Dylan watching any Disney movie: it would just be better if it had murder in it Dylan when he watched ratatouille: WHY IS THERE SO MUCH VIOLENCE
8:42 the soup was so bad it made a rat vomit in his mouth , Breaking the laws of nature ( rats carnt vomit )
DYLAN YOU NEED TO REDO RIVERDALE NOW THAT IT'S A BIGGER MESS
In the heights (2021) please?
Could you react to Cruella
weird time to find out dylan is to rats what nazis are to jews.
watch goodfellas 🫶🏾
Ratatouille is my all time favorite disney movie and it brought me so much joy that you liked it. :)
What I don’t understand is that though Remy was pulling Linguini’s hair to cook, by the time the critic came to challenge him he would have learned some skills by then, even by just a little.
Please react to Stranger Things 3 and 4 ❤❤
By the end of the video Dylan gaslit me into believing their names were actually Pierre, Jaqués, and Chester 😂
Thank you for posting Dylan, I really needed this!😭
We all know how big of a 'One tree hill' fan you are and in that case...... Angel Falls Christmas.... just saying... it's a must watch and not the good kind
A fun fact about Ego is that for most of the movie he is very thin to the point he looks sickly because he typically takes one or two bites and makes a judgement(such as in his intro scene pushing away a full plate). But in the last scene you can see he looks more plump and less gaunt, at least in the face. Meaning, he's been eating a lot of Remy's food in full.
I own 2 mice so no Dylan... I wouldn't kill a mouse
Dude, you don‘t kill a mouse in your house 🐭😢 you catch her/him with a live mouse trap and get them outside (far away from your home) could be Remy you know!
You HAVE TO review “Mindcage” a New Movie - it is so bad! And i really want to se your reaction😅
"he can control the feet with the hair? Yo this dude is not human" yeah. Cuz he's a rat😂
Remy’s a rat not a mouse wtf you talking about
Italian jokes anddd calls him Pierre
I am definitely not putting in a recommendation, I am simply stating a first and last of boy meets world would be cool
It made me so sad that dylan didnt notice colettes eyes look down at linguinis groin when he was saying he had a "little...small..."
This is a horror film! - Dylan watching ratatouille. Lmao 🤣
“guess there’s a new king in town. his name is PIERRE” *me giggling to myself knowing his name is in fact not pierre*
Pierreeeeeee GASSSLYYYYY
Ok but 21:56 should be his dating app profile picture
MEGAMIND
pls watch American Assasin
You look so much like doctor mike , especially your voice😍😍😍
25:34 💀💀💀💀
This is one of my Favourite movies I watched as a kid and thus my love for eiffel tower and Paris was born.....watching Dylan enjoying this movie...gives me so much happiness  😁
I'm glad to see the transitions for sponsors are really getting better 😏
Can you react to "finding nemo" please
I know Dylan hates suggestions but hear me out : Dylan watching peaky blinders I think it would be rly funny
My guy i saw that you played Until Dawn and I think you will enjoy if you play The Quarry
Dylan please watch ‘Wrong place’ with Bruce Willis😆
My father gave me the nickname skinner, I would have preferred the mob ties to the childhood trauma 🙃 I'm 30 and still have no idea why my sister was baby girl and I got ....skinner.
Me: why is Dylan bringing up books 🤨 Audible: *exists as his own and only sponsor* Me: ohhhh that makes sense now
12:12 auto-captions say "I'm not a big history gay"
I capture them and put them outside.
Let’s not overlook that when he’s showing the rat his apt, he said “it’s not much.” TO A RAT. 🤣
being french and watching you react to ratatouille is even funnier
You got all the names wrong dilllllll lmao
Ratatouille is one of my favourites movies. I love that you enjoy it too. You should watch Game Night or Knives Out, I think they are really good
As a french I feel aggressed by Dylan’s french accent 😂😂 its just AWFUL
“Moose are like terrorists”
Suuuuuuuiiiiiiiiiiii
*Not a fun fact:* The chef Gusteau was inspired from Bernand Loiseau, a famous French chef that killed himself. What were the reasons? End of the 90s, Asian food (fusion) started to ender France and customers wanted this type of food... But Bernand didn't want to change. His company started having debts while he suffered from depression. He shot himself because there were rumours the Michelin Guide was going to eliminate one of his three stars. One of his co-workers said Bernand had confessed he would kill himself if he ever lost a star.   (Sorry if there are mistakes, English isn't my first language).
new subscriber! I love your videos🤩, would be interesting to see you react to The Chronicles of narnia🤔🤩
"a rats throw of pepper" I wanna use that description in a recipe one day.
6:05 then there is me who fights with her cats whenever they bring me a living mouse as a present. I always try to steal them and bring them to the garden. Today my cat hid behind the sofa where I couldn't get to her. I am still traumatized from the sounds of her eating it. 😐
I can't really decide if YouTube hates (1) or loves (2) me. But fact is, I got the notification for this video 4 days late (1) and I am having an absolute horrific day that just got a whole lot better (2) . Ah, I love Mondays 😌
I'm not gonna watch this, but I just wanted to comment that I'm glad I'm not alone, I support you 100% but this movie is waaaayyy to creepy to sit and watch you watch this at 3am I might be back tomorrow to watch this, well see. :D
Me watching this wearing a saved by the bell shirt 😂
Dylan confusing colette with Christina I was trying to figure out why he was calling me💀
No but why were was so many guns in this movie ?? Guns are freaking forbidden in france. Kinsa satisfying to have an american also be shook but then it just makes me questions why they thought it was necessary Also there is no moose in france. Wild boar and bear yes
I can't wait for him to figure out that the house that Ego flashed back to...is the old woman's house from the beginning of the movie. 😅
i’m like 99% sure dylan’s thinking of flushed away
I’d love to see you react to Barbarian! Shoutout from Brazil 🇧🇷💛
its funny cuz I watched this video them saw a dead mouse today
Raccacoonie is such a fun movie
I'm on my periods and in pain right now and watching you really calms me down. Which makes you look really fucking sexy right now and I think it's making me kinda feral🤔🧐
That little pause before realizing he's just like Linguini 🤣 I was thinking the same thing! And also: women sometimes like a goofball 🤷‍♂
A moose statistically has more kills than any other mammal in North America
OMG Dylan you HAVE to watch WEDNESDAY next.  Knowing you so far you will LOVE it. It would be so funny to watch your reaction omg🤣🤣
Rats didn't cause the plague. It's been debunked since 2017. The most recent studies show that it was spread via human lice/mites to other humans.   Nope, I wouldn't kill wild mice or rats. It doesn't solve the actual problem of how they're getting inside. Also, I don't like causing unnecessary harm so I'd never use lethal traps or poison*   *(The use of rodenticide is a very painful, slow way to die. Also, ater the rodent dies, other wild animals, pets, or even children [avg of 10,000 a year in the US] can get secondary poisoning by handling/eating the dead rodent, which can lead to death or other serious reactions. )  I've actually found some young house mice in my garage (babies but had fur and eyes open) and contacted a wildlife rehabilitator who took them in. They ended up being fine and released eventually
I have 8 pet mice. They are adorable. I have an affinity for mice, sorry Dylan.
Reminds me of a meme 🙈 it goes like this 😅  Girl: Wow that was the best sex I've ever had, but I have to ask.... why are you wearing that goofy chefs hat?? Me: *beet red and physically exhausted slowly takes off hat to reveal ratatouille controlling my every move*
Dylan you have to watch flipped I bet that you never watched before
Could you do a commentary on the bee movie?
please react to h2o just add waterrr😤
I hate when content creators stop for promos, but Dylans transitions into them are so smooth and unexpected that it's actually pretty funny. I feel like they are the most planned part of his videos.
Why Dylan dolls up every time more that before..it looks like he seduces us.
Renaming every character.. I love it.
i came back to this video from halfway through and was really confused as to who pierre was.
20:24 fun fact, the shop with hanging rat bodies is real and is located in France 👀
29:57 theres a reason 4 this!!!  the romance element is probably so underwhelming and out of place because the disney people (idk wat theyre called,, executives??) most likely wouldnt have green light ratatouille as it was, so they probably made an agreement like "you can have gun violence and dead rats as long as the leading female character is in a relationship" idk if thats a fact or smth i made up in my head tho :>
PLEASE REACT TO BRIDGERTONNNNNNNNNN
I loveee this movie and I have killed mouse (due to necessacity) after watching it.
Top tier editing! Fantastique, as usual ;)
Man really said there should be a scene of colette teaching linguini how to rollerskate but then includes the actual scene where linguini teaches colette how to rollerskate. Brilliant
Dylan…you always like violence and now you don’t lol
Thank you Dylan for the psa about Moose 😌
I’m so lost I thought the rats name is Remi
DYLAN I KNOW YOU WILL HATE ME FOR THIS BUT WATCH H20 PLS LOLOL I THINK IT WOULD BE FUNNY
i'm a pet rat owner who hates this movie because everybody and their great grandma names their rat "remy" but you're gonna make me defend this movie anyway
Not sure how to feel knowing these rats can cook better than I can
There was a tweet a couple years ago where some girl said something along the lines of “I’m just trying to watch ratatouille but guys keep trying to Netflix and chill” and I can’t watch this movie anymore bc my friend use ratatouille as a code word for Netflix and chill
moose are very....startling - but soooo very tasty.🍲🍲 Also I've got cats. 2/5 of them have hunting skills - if I find the rodent first, it deserves to live - as the cats have failed.
I definitely do not kill the mice in my house, Dylan 😭 my family sets traps but they have no idea that I let the mice right back out and now they are my friends 😌
I’ve been here since you had 200,000 subscribers!!!
you have watched boy meets world???!!! I LOVE YOU
His nickname is Remy and his real name is Pierre of course
Dylan you should watch avengers heroes of tomorrow its free on youtube oh and there is death in this movie 💥
Dylan expecting Colette to realize she actually fall in love with a rat instead of the guy reminded me of Bee Movie, idkw but well that's another fucked up situation...
Now I want Dylan to watch "The Tale of Despereaux"...
i always loved how Gusteau was a very famous chef but he got one bad review his entire life and died
12:19 Relatable, I do also wonder what am I good at when I start thinking about the amount of stuff I suck at xD
ah yes the first movie i saw in theatres
dylan i saw an edit of u today
actually rats are very clean
i wonder what Dylan’s reaction would be to the Disney theory that the grandma in the beginning is related to Ego cause the house from the flashback was the same 🤔
I wish you took recos!!!! Bc I got the greatest movie but nah
So I've noticed this very simple thing you've been doing with your edits, when the footage overlaps with the next audio clip and I had to say... I know it's a very simple thing to do when editing, but I really appreciate it. It really helps with your comedic timing. As much as you appreciate the zoom effect, I suppose...
Man, this movie would have been SO dark if Remy took his beef with his dad too far--to the point of "failing" to sniff out the poison!!
Dylan, please react to Robots(2005), it's extremely funny, the animation is really well done and I think you will like the message of it !
1:58 boy meets world was so good 😂
A lot of people love this film, and it certainly has good moments, but I simply cannot get past its absolutely insane premise
me and my four pet rats are taking great offence in all the rat slander going on in this video. rats are cute and goth as fuck.
Dylan doesn’t want violence guys🫶🏾😇
I think she likes him bc he listen to her, takes her seriously but he's Nos afraid of her, as she explains apparently nobody did before
Watch pacific rim, it’s a banger and nothing like that harry styles movie
4:01 and 6:28 the fear in his eyes😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Wait until Dylan finds out that the shot of the store with dead rats on the window is based on a true store
Dylan: questioning what he's good at. Also Dylan: Doing super smooth product placements.
25:32 same
Are we gonna get a Watching only the first and last episodes of The Walking Dead that would be amazing
Turtles 😂
WHAT DO YOU MEAN COLLETTE HAD NO REASON TO LIKE LINGUINI HE CAN SKATE AND THAT IS VERY ATTRACTIVE TO HER
in spirit of christmas and since i just rewatched ur home alone video, you should consider watching a short comedy sketch from Studio C called Home Alone Parady: Kevin Defends the Apartment. It's a concept where Kevin is now an adult and was briefly left home along by his roommates
4:20 a moose bit my sister once…
Ratatouille is a lot wilder than I remember 😂
Dylan please watch RRR, it's awesome.
Rats are actually quite clean animals which regularly groom themselves. They get a bad reputation because of the plague which was spread by fleas btw not the rats.
this video was a godsend during finals week
Already liked it before watching it because I know I won't be disappointed with this content.
This movie is wild 😅
Love Dylan's commitment to call Remy "Pierre" despite them saying it all through the movie
please rewatch the marathon of high school musical
dylan is right guys,mooses are absolute units,most people dont realise just how big they are
5:34 the fact that he almost would have gotten a virus
So you missed the part in the film earlier where Linguini was teaching Collette how to skate and she fell into his arms then. Tisk - silly Dyllan - missing his foreshadowing. What are we gonna do with you?
I appreciate you making France's flag using your two lights and white wall lol
I have a request. Can you please do Ready Player One. I’d love to see what you think of it.
the rats name is remi nor pyer
Americans be like... "oh yeah a France based film" ... *(speaks with an Italian stereotiped accent)
"Cause I'm a really smart guy".....000-KAAY....?
17:04 now Dylan...we're passed judging for your sexual innuendos 🤣
I love that you enjoyed this movie so much. It is kinda underrated because rats around food is sooooo gross. But it is a great movie.
I love that he didn't even ha e to make a joke about the word "swallow" just that knowing look to the camera had me dirtily chuckling away
Hahaha omg i love your reactions to this movie xD lol xx Also how are you single ? 0_o
Dylan there is a animated clipe of remy talking about The plague with his brother, he explains why rats should be friends with humans , you should make a vídeo about it, love from Brasil 🇧🇷
Dylan, are we ever going to get Alita: Battle Angel?
please react to the flatshare on paramount + (a boy and girl share a bed but never meet - he works night shifts
We can clearly see it was made from an American point of view cause we don't have guns in France let alone a grandma lmao
Can you do a video on Enola Holmes
Collette didn’t like Linguini cuz she thinks he can cook. She likes him cuz he takes it from her 🤭 17:00
The way Dylan presents the sponsors is really really good! 😂😂
i’ll pull your hair Dylan lol
Dylan your alarm at the shotgun was honestly everything 😂❤
Multiple moose is meese. xD
Lol why can’t he say Remmy!?
12:31 the way he just turns the light off 🤣🤣 also don't know if i can forgive Dylan for skipping the part where he knocks Remy into the river and it cuts to them on the bridge again but Linguini is soaked
He needs to see the ratatouille short explaining the plague 😂
Tried to watch this next to my sleeping husband. A little over 4:00 in and I realize what a mistake I have made. This is what a mistake feels like. 😂
I don’t know what it is about Dylan that makes me just as happy when he’s wrong as I am when he’s right. That’s some skill, right there. 🤣
Yo for some reason I remember Linguini and the girl going on a date in rollar blades, is that just me
20:59 why did this immediately remind me of the bee movie
I don't hate mice. I used to see them in my old house, so even though I dislike chees I took the cheese string in the lunch home to cut it up and leave it in corners as food for the mice. I used to do this in middle school, but then we moved, and I don't see them now. I watched this movie in my freshman year of high school in french class. Then we watched this movie 2 more times in the second and third years if highschool.
The ”hi hi hi he was paranoid” 😂😂 amazing hahaha i live you dylan! Your videos always cheer me up ❤❤ keep doing what you do!!
Linguini with a hair-pulling kink. I am as here for it as Dylan is 👏
i just found out recently that the cookbook from the home Remi lived in was Mrs. Ego. Therefore, he used his mother's recipe
Love love love this commentary
I just had the absolute funniest experience watching this video. I got the part where Dylan is saying "she likes guys taking it from her" (17:00) and when he paused sirens started up on the street outside my house. Dead ass thought it was a sound effect Dylan added and absolutely died 😂😂😂
Not Dylan just describing everything he is seeing
"She has a SHOTGUN? This has to be America -- wait, no this is in France. I guess that makes sense though, you'd need a shotgun to defend against moose attacks. Moose are terrorists."
New favorite unit of measurement "Rat's Fist"
Okay, this is like the 4th time i notice this so i gotta say it, everytime Dylan switches to his sponsored section he looks even more attractive like idk what it is but i think he knows what hes doing
i've watched ratatouille  many times already but watching it again with Dylan's reactions was worth one time more
“a rats throw” should be a new way of measuring 😭
anyone else hoping he watches the parent trap?
I got whiplash from clicking so fast on this video
As a French person, I'd like to testify that... the dude's appartment at the beginning, costs A LOT of money in Paris. Like, that dude is rich, we shouldn't feel so sorry for him even when he's just the janitor.
Ratatouille is my favorite of all these Pixar movies. I think it's a masterpiece. The color the message the scenes it is a great movie!!
The women with the shotgun is probably from Ohio
One of the most prominent things I take away from these Videos is.... Dylan is a bottom...and is not one bit ashamed of it in the slightest.
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
You should watch Everything Everywhere All At Once!
25:35 😂😂😂
Dylan, Colette didn't know how to roller skate so she couldn't have taught him, love your videos btw
Goofball with no talent, has a huge female following. You are the new 93% lol.
colette glanced down when linguini said he had a "tiny, little..." HOW DID DYLAN MISS THAT
Dylan remembered Gusteau as being a ghost (although its a hallucination) is the closest I think I've seen Dylan remember something that I can think of
Yea that animated movie focus thing. Just noticed it when I got my bf to watch Treasure Planet for the first time. It's when they are at Doblers place and the Cresent moon is in the background when Jim's talking but then they switch spots and Dobler is the one that points to the crescent moon when the conversation shifts to their plans and he says they are going to Montressor station...and then a Zoom in on the crescent moon through the window pane and you see how it's actually a space station and now that's where our characters are.
id see mice in my house and safely put them outside to be natures problem
His name is Remy not Pierre smh
I know you're trying to warn me about moose but I wanna fight  moose so bad
Fun fact the rat killing shop with all the rats hanging on the window is a real place and it still open till this day and you can go see it it’s called Julien Arouze and Co.
I love how scandalized Dylan is the entire movie 😂😂.
I love how he really enjoys watching the movie☺️
dylan getting all of the background details wrong and running with it is hilarious
You should watch Arcane. I’m interested to know your take on it. I personally loved it
DYLAN PLEASE U GOTTA WATCH BEE MOVIE
REACT TO CARS !!!!
Bro Ratatouille in Egyptian audio hits different it gives it a whole new level of funnyyyyyy
Dylan would be so disapointed when he tried to fend of a moose with a shot gun.. 🤔
hmm twilight… 🐀?
"The worse appartament with the best view" pretty much sums up Paris' apparaments lol 11:16
Why is no one talking about his segue to the audible ad?? That was hella solid.
32:39 was my favorite joke of this video🤣🤣🤣I don't know why. Dylan has done it with this one
Dylan saying very specifically 1446 when talking about the rats in the shop window makes me think he actually lived during then.
Why is Dylan so attractive? 🤔 Weird.
Fun fact the shop with the dead rats window display exists irl !
Dylan acting like he don't like violence when he did a soliloquy about Remy poisioning his father 😂  Dylan orgasming every time Colette stab that knife into the cutting board, 😂😂 😏
Irrelevant to this video but I have to say I started watching The O.C for the first time and my god Dylan you were right this show man is fucking incredible I’m on s2 now where they find out Caleb had a secret love child shit is crazy thank you for pushing the o.c on us who haven’t watched it.
My favorite videos in this channel are the ones when Dylan truly enjoys himself watching a movie
How are these rats not getting hair all over the dish
Can someone please make a compilation of all the times Dylan has crushed on older women
why are there two r in scarred
I remember watching this movie with my two rats when I still had them 😆❤️ very sweet and underrated pets that go too soon. And like Remi, they loved trying different foods (the ones they could eat)
dylan pretends to be dumb a lot but i've learned so much about movies from watching his videos
I've never seen this movie. My college dorm mate would play it every night before bed. So I would fall asleep to it but I've never seen it because his laptop pointed away from me
That rat poisoning shop is based on a real one in Paris, my mum pointed it out to me when i was like 5 😭scared the shit out of me
I was just binging dylans vids and realised he has yet to watch anatasia 1997
Thank you Dylan for admitting that Ratatouille is scary as fuck, my brother and I came out of the cinema, being legitimately scarred 😅😂
Dear Dylan, the rats did not have the plague, it was the fleas they had adopted as buddies. Never disrespect Remy like that again <3
I knew I LOVED Dylan because saved by the bell definitely sucked & boy meets world is top tier 💯
Dylaaaaan I need you to react to Anastasia the animated movie of 1997, PLEASEEE!!! Its really good!  Ps: love the video as always
the worst thing is that the rat shop really exists in paris ! its in the marais I believe
Dylan why are you doing an Italian accent😂 Dylan trying to do the French accent is 🤣🤣🤣🤣😊
Is it not obvious? Jacque is a malewife, and Christina is a girl boss. Get with the program Dylan
My brother and I had great fun when we saw this in the cinema. Funny that even Dylan gave it a chance. An underrated film. Couldn't stop laughing at Dylan's reactions😂
dylan may not have talents, but he does have charisma
Just Dylan casually changing names that not only doesn't fit the time period nor the country. This is peak comedy.
I know Dylan doesn’t take recommendations but he does need to try ratatouille now I feel
you really should watch rio if you didn't already
I thought my son's grandchild died so I bought him flowers upto $505433209.... but it turned out that he was never born. They are all white lilies, reply if you are interesting in buying 'em. $10 per lily:)
dylan sounded so canadian when he started talking about moose, I swear even his wisconsin accent changed
I'm like 70% sure that you can get off a charge of murder in France if you can prove its a crime of passion?
YOU USED TO LIKE IT!
As a French, it's was very funny, but also really hard to watch
Wait until you see the peckers drawn in Disney cartoons. Disney 33 degree mason satanist cabal.  Tell lie vision. "Programs".
I'm definitely adding "a rat's fist worth" to my vocabulary
Dylan- i don't want violence the world already has so much violence, also Dylan in any other Disney movie- why cant we get a death scene, there needs to be more death in these movies.
I fucking LOVE this movie gosh and I'm so glad Dylan didn't slander it 💀
Watching this now as an adult, what I thought at the end was- damn the labor costs they must’ve saved by having rats cook and not chefs lol
I would be willing to eat food cooked by rats at long as they are sanitized
I think u should watch all thr music videos of k/da (guess u would like evelynn)
fun fact, the shop from 20:25 actually exists in Paris and has the same display in front
22:11
Dylan, stop lying! We all know you ain't single!
Oh you're saying these rats aren't SANITARY?! I ask as I kiss my rattos on the face. They're actually quite clean.
And this is how the plague started 😅
watching this as a french... an experience
6:09 well yes ofc i’ll make sure the rat is….far far away from me but when i saw Ant Man i definitely felt bad for ants after LMFAOOOOO
why does dylan sound exactly like that one hot doctor
I have pet rats and have done extensive research on their care and needs and have learned a lot about them. There's a giant misconception that they're disgusting when they're actually the cleanest rodent and cleaner than run of the mill cats and dogs. They're constantly cleaning themselves and each other and my rats always clean me when I let them out. They don't smell or ever have anything on them because of how extensively they clean themselves.
the italian accent from the second the video started...even though the movie is set in france 😭
The way you were so inaccurate did u last watch it when u were 10? 😭
Ok, the ad transition was pretty smooth. You are getting better.
Actually the pest plague was passed on bye fleas 😄
Love the movie. But I will let my cat go after them. He has one job. And he does an okay job lol
6:55 this scene, totally fine in a Rated G film.  But have a kid have two mom's on screen and oooohhhh noooooo
Moose are the terrorists. 😂 moose= sam Winchester. Crowleys moose. Well he was dangerous.
“A rat’s throw of pepper”😂😂
"what if she falls in love with juck not pier" I know he doesn't take recommendations but it'd be interesting to see his reaction to the bee movie
“If I don’t like it, I don’t swallow”
I love how the movie has two villains and two grand finales, basically. Interesting plot structure.
The way I’m in love with Dylan breaks my heart, how could I feel this way about an American 😅
Oh god. Im four minutes in and Dylan is already totally chaotic. Love it😄
This movie truely did divide chefs  A lot of it is accurate to the chef life and the way kitchens work, which is rare to see in cooking movies  But  It’s also about a bad chef succeeding and a rat in a commercial kitchen?!  It’s a great movie but I just can’t enjoy it because of the rats in the kitchen 🥴
as a french person this video was a total EXPERIENCE, the jokes, the accent, EVERYTHING
This video scarred me for life.
Collette was literally me when I was a chef 😅
Just rewatched the episode series, I want another one 😭
can you react to coraline please? its a masterpiece and the start of my childhood trauma
He's so funny 😂 he literally cures my childhood trauma and depression every video 😂😂
i do not remember this movie being that dark lmaoo
pls do how to train your dragon 2 next
Another banger if ya ask me🤌🤌
I think it's fair to notice that most "pests" tend to carry diseases due to them living in the middle of human waste and eating from out trash. A pet rat (or even raccoons, possums, etc) can be lovely pets, live longer lives and don't really make you sick if they bite you, as long as you keep them clean and feed them well (just like any other pet, dogs can cause bad infections with their bites for example). So i'd say a restaurant having a pet rat is basically the same as restaurants that have dogs or cats running around (except they probably would have less hair lol)
Dylan literally creaming his pants when Colette was introduced 😂
I say this in the most heterosexual way he's got nice teeth...😁  I say this in the least heterosexual way I'd frick. 🤷‍♂️
You should do a movie commentary about WEDNESDAY!!!!!!
Do you not understand that she likes him bc she can peg him?
am i the only one that looks at Dylans hands and thinks about what could...or could not be. unhhh
Dylan has just been exclusively watching cartoons ? LOVE IT BUT I KIND OF MISS THE EARLY 2000S UNTIL I HATE MYSELF ERA! again both are much loved! ( also I see an abundance of sour patch kids in recent videos !!! I am worried)
I can't wait for the day when I get to listen to the audiobook of Dylan's book on audible  I'm sure it'll be out next week
6:30 اكبر كذاب بالدنيا 😭  ازعجنا في كل فلم يبغا دم ومقاتل
Haven't he reacted to this before? Or he re-uploaded? Is this a Deja Vu effect of Mandela Effect?!!! What's going on Dylan...
Moose is singular for mice and that's how this movie teaches us they're scary.
Dylan saying he’s a goofball with no talent made me go hmm sounds familiar and then he was like omg it’s me and I spit out my drink
Turtles to you too. 🐢
rare footage of dylan genuinely enjoying a movie
:D
We all notice Dylan has a thing for dominating women right?
I haven’t watched ratatouille in years omg😭
I'm a redhead who likes their hair pulled
dylan : all movies would be better with de@th in it  also dylan : wHy iS tHiS m0viE sO viOLenT
Even after all this time, it's one of my favourite animated movies
Rats aren't gross lol the plague started bc catholic people were very superstitious and fearful of cats, so they killed a LOT of them and with no cats around to kill the rats.... well....
It’s amazing to me that Tangled was rated PG but this was G. I guess violence doesn’t count if the villain is a bad shot. Lol also kinda surprising the amount of sexual innuendos they slipped in here.. Like watching Nickelodeon 💀
Having rats or mice in your home unwelcomed is absolutely TERRIFYING   I’ve never been scared of bugs or animals, I woke up once while camping and there was a whole ass alligator so close to my tint it was touching it and I wasn’t scared, but when my home suddenly got rats AND mice and I saw one for the first it legitimately scared me so badly I vomited everywhere.   You cannot tell me, any cartoon, movies or how many pet rodents you’ve had or seen have made you like wild rats or mice and wouldn’t be horrified by them in your home
really surprised you didn't comment on the look down she does at 22:12
i can't believe you didn't realize that Colette DID react when linguini said "i have a little..." her eyes dart down for a moment! and i think it is hilar
please never stop reacting to movies, especially these types! you are one of my fave reactors
CAN YOU MAKE A MOVIE COMMENTARY FOR PARASITE BY BONG JOON-HO
have never clicked on a video so fast in my life
There was a rat/mouse in our attic and while they did set out traps, my mom definitely called it Ratatouille, wrong name and everything. Dunno what ever happened to that little guy.
Italia France
Dylan you are one of the only people who keep me sane
As someone who lived in Paris for many years, I can assure you rats in restaurants is a much more common experience than you’d expect
The audible segue was sooooo smooth
I think I can speak for all of us when I say that since I heard Dylan was deathly afraid of rats I have been waiting for this day.
I ain’t saying you missed this but 45 minutes into the movie Colette roles up her sleeves and you can see a horizontal cut on her arm in Dylan terms “she is addicted to pain
Part of me wants to be offended by the Italian stereotypes but another part of me is also. . .aware that two generations ago my family actually was involved in the New York mob so. I guess they’re accurate lol
So funny that Dylan keeps calling Remy Pierre.😂
Also, Dylan: "I LIKE TURTLES"
Most movies: Woman exists --> turn into love interest. Even if it doesn't make sense.
About the moose, idk if Dylan has seen the Mickey Mouse or Disney show where they DRESS UP AS A MOOSE… it scares me to this day 🤠  Update it’s the 1936 Moose Hunters Mickey Mouse film
The G in the rating is for gun.
The amount of times this guy has asKed for violence in movies and now when he gets it :
@20:10 - It is actually based on a real store in Paris lol Look up: Julien Aurouze & Co.
The fact that you talked about Twilight during the day movie 🐀🐀🐀🐀
the first time i've ever seen dylan being so against death. usually he'd start hopping in joy at the idea of someone potentially dying.
My first time encounter on this account but he is so handsome and genuine.
French movie, Italian accent.
The second there’s actually violence in a movie Dylan got to make jokes about it and him non violent every other movie he ever watched- Needs violence!!
It's crazy that in theory the critic is Ligunis half brother
whaaaat rats only live 2 years?????
22:15 I saw that coming from a mile away
Dylan is so good looking its almost distracting
My mental health took a dip this past week but, watching Dylan, watch a movie that has perplexed me my entire life healed something in me 😂
At times I want to give Dylan accent advice, but other times, hes a precious gem to enjoy wholeheartedly
A day late to this Jewel!
who wouldnt date u dylan???
i’m sorry i seriously love your videos…but i’m a history buff and i just wanted to let you know that the plague was technically started from rats. the logic to this is that the rats are what spread the plague to humans. but was originally it was fleas that started the plague. anyways…love your videos! ❤
Thank God I never have seen the movie.
the plague did start with rats. but not because they bit people, it was because they were brought to italy(?) by ship (trading routes), and the fleas living on them spread to people, who didn’t bathe much at the time, the fleas would bite them and then bam 1/3 of Europe’s population dead. it didn’t help that people’s methods of trying to get rid of the plague only accelerated it 😅.
it wasn’t the rats who brought the plague it was FLEAS!!
Dylan should watch Wonder Woman , Im sure he gonna love dr poision.
The fact that Ratatouille takes like ~4 hours to make is so insane to me
rack focus? more like rat focus am I right ladies
one of my favorites!
"If I don't love it , I don't swallow"  Dylan @25:35 ..... 🙂🙂  Dylan No!!
Rats didn't start the plague. It was the ticks that feed off them. Anyway, great movie.
Dip
*brings back Moosesees*
This movie was the best thing disney ever did and I stand by that
This whole video is just Dylan trying to deny he loves strong violent women & failing hardcore😂
Dylan saying he struggles with literature is hilarious considering that he's been writing a book for forever and a year
As a girl who has had pet rats, I did see Ratatoulie and I shall not kill the mice or rats. I shall take them out to the wild and politely tell them not to not do a break in…. Ok, I also might feed and adopt them. Depends on the vibe.
32:06 one of the best bits of the year 👏
dylan watching a french movie and talking in an italian accent will never not be funny
10:35 Remi not talking reminds me of Tape Face LOL. He would be indeed funny if he kept using gestures with Linguini
The rat & the girl had more chemistry than her with the guy.. I mean he’s the reason she fell for the guy in the 1st place-
I cannot believe the incredible speech by Ego went completely over Dylan’s head, I love it sm I cry every time
ratatouille: *movie in France* Dylan: *italian accent 🤌🤌🤌*
Thank you Dylan for finally reviewing the best film!
When Dylan said Christina it threw me way off 😭😭 I looked away from the screen for a second and then heard my name 😭😭
15:24 why am I not even surprised? Let's add Collete and the Old Lady to the list
i’ve been waiting for this one
6:29 tbh, I didn't even realize that 😳
20:58 alright Dylan, this isn't The bee Movie
*Dylan wants murder in Disney movies*  *Disney puts murder in a movie*  Dylan: 😱
Watch kungfu panda 2 or boss baby
Shout out to Dylans amazing facial hair
Let’s respect parrot for almost ending his run on the lifesteal smp just to try to get back at someone
Its funny for majority of movies Dylan has reviewed wanted violence. This movie provided that but is scared.. jokes on him
You're right this movie was gross when you thing about it.
3:56 🤣
I can’t believe Dylan didn’t use that book question to transition into the Audible sponsorship 😂
Dude!! You have to watch Treasure Planet! It just became 20 years old and it’s one of the most underrated animated movies ever.
The monent you said "Pierre" I immediately remembered Colin from Who's Line is it Anyway "I'm pee-air becausemybladder'sempty. Our top story tonight..."
rats can make for good pets, personally not for me as they creep me out, but they're clean when they're owned and not just sewer rats. also, fleas carried the plague which would go onto the rats and then rats carried to other rats across European countries, to people and so on, SO technically, yes and no, basically it wasn't their fault. in my opinion i definitely would invest in owning a rat if it could help me cook, i can't cook.
Dylan: "Movie studios always want to put violence in their films" This film: **Literally directed by the same person who wrote and directed The Iron Giant, aka an animated masterpiece whose entire central theme revolves around anti-violence**
Literally the only thing linguini can do is roller skate lol he literally had to teach his girl on one of their dates but you probably missed it
they don’t make movies like this anymore
Kinda want to see him watch FernGully or Thumbelina
I think Dylan should watch The Bee movie since he suggested Colette and Remi falling in love 😅😉
i don’t kill mice or rats, just get them out of my area and find the source and stop em
I’m still waiting for Kung fu panda 2🙃
Dylan: “Why is it so violent?!” Also Dylan watching every movie ever: “I really hope someone dies”
Epic accent
This is the third time I've watched this video and I think it's my new comfort video from Dylan 💛💛💛 2nd place is the tangled one lol
"It's always a fun journey for me—" (Press space) *TRIGGERED* 🤣🤣🤣
Wait, I thought ego was fired(?) because everyone hated his review, because he never reviewed anyone in such a positive light. So he was ridiculed for it.
how Dylan decides to start applying logic NOW, watching a Disney animated movie xD
Oh! Him learning to skate from her would be interesting and a cute little moment in the finale part, buuut, him teaching her does show that he does have some talent of his own.
He did not just say the old women was SEXY ahhhh oh my 😮😂😂 5:20
I love how proud of yourself you were for that transition to the sponsor 🤣
To be fair the media scene is more so “hey this huge restaurant has a new head chef lets interview him.” Basically it’s not an ego thing.
Pretty sure it wasn’t the rats necessarily that brought the plague, but the fleas that they carried. If that makes sense.
Fun fact: rats don’t have a gag reflex so when linguini messes with the soup and Remi runs past it and gags it was so bad it broke the laws of nature
As a French person I'm debating which is less believable, the cooking rat or the mutiple guns...
Some idiot Pope in the 1200s declared cats satantic so a bunch of them were killed so the rat population got out of control and the FLEAS on the rats spread The Plague.   See what happens when you hate cats? A third of humans gets wiped out 😼
15:24 me watching his face knowing Colette uses three knives 🤣
The audible transition caught me off guard😂😩
Dylan: "Movie is unrealistic, because he got the girl" Movie: Main character is a rat that cooks, Lol Dylan is great.
TRENDING!!!!!!!!!! YASSSSSSSSSSSS
Ratatouille gone wrong, Ratatouille gone sexual
you should react to the new Pinocchio on Netflix
Rats actually can't stand being dirty they clean themselves constantly the only problem is rodents that live in the wild or on the street can get parasites from other creatures that are attracted to human garbage. Pet rodents won't survive in the wild/street they have different immune systems.
Do the good son it has Macualy culkin
Actually ticks are responsible for most plagues and pandemics throughout history, though rats are bitten by ticks and can then spread the illness to humans. That’s why bats and opossums are so important cause they keep tick and fea numbers down.
by far my favorite movie reaction from dylan !!!!!
Rats are actually very clean animals! but since they are a pest (meaning there are a ton of them), they eventually got pushed to live in places like the sewers, so we associate them with those places, but if they lived in good conditions, rats love to bathe and are pretty organized :))
"How do you think the plague started?" Me: Fl- Dylan: Rats.
Honestly the best experience I've had with this film was when i watched it, looked out to the garden, saw a rat and screamed. Also wanna add that France does display dead rats in their store windows (I don't know if they're real or not)
Not him being attracted to Collette, Ego, and the old gun lady simultaneously. The range of this man's preferences 👌
People think that rats are gross animals, but they really aren't. They're cleaner than most house pets.  Rats WERE NOT the main carriers of fleas and lice that spread the plague—it was HUMANS.
thanks  dylan now i cant sleep bc im scared a of a rat breaking into my house and crawling over my sleeping body.
parabéns pelo vídeo, você é incrível e consegue me entreter com facilidade (além de ser super bonito).
when are u gonna react to ENCANTOOO
“He’s just a lovable goofball with no talent” yes Dylan and that’s why your channel is widely successful !!!!
Literally my ultimate comfort movie
Trap the mouse and let it outside! Although it'd probably just come back to your house lol
The guns caught me so off guard like this is a children's movie
Fun fact about the plague: It actually wasn’t really the fault of rats. The bubonic plague started bc of bacteria that got in fleas that got on rats. So, really, the bubonic plague was a really bad bacterial infection. The more you know😁
Dying laughing at the Audible segue. “I would need my fingers to be able to read a book” I was like how is that relevant??? 😂
This movie is about a possessed rat who then possesses a man, but in a less intrusive way.
No, I'm not going to kill the rat. I'm gonna run out of there and call my mommy.
No lie @17:05 I said “c’mon Dylan” and did a disapproving look and then Dylan answered me @17:10 😅😂 lol like if we were having an actual conversation 😂
Did he just say, "I didn't feel that sound effect in my groin"??? HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
I have never watched a Desny movie in English and so just realized how BRILLIANT our Arabian cast is
(Not So) Fun fact, there is a store in Paris that does actually have the dead rats in the window.
This was so funny omg thank you Dylan
I hope he does one of these with the movie Flushed Away or Chicken Run 🙏😂
I think I’ve rewatched the jump scare at 9:14 25 times, I have tears streaming down my face from laughing so hard 😂
Dylan if I may, the reason Colette finds Alfredo attractive is because he possesses the only two-character traits a man needs, submissive and breedable.
🐢🐢
6:15 actually,  I have 7 pet rats lol
In many ways, the work of a YouTube commenter is easy. We risk very little, yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth we commenters must face, is that in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful than our criticism designating it so. But there are times when a critic truly risks something, and that is in the discovery and defense of the *new*. The world is often unkind to new talent, new creations. The new needs friends.
My favorite movie. My favorite Dylan.
Back when Disney films were actually just a load of fun and produced really well. Masterpieces. Real artistry.
dylan making fun of people buying a twilight audiobook when i used his code to get a twilight audiobook lmao
"iT'S a liTtlE biT SexY" I'm dying!
Love the video. Watching it for the third of fourth time in 1 day right now...
dylan analyzing this so hard. mf this is a rats movie.
dylan, my man, this single thing could be solved very easily.
Once a mouse is indoors, potentially knowing the location of my food, it’s a rap. Remy, Mickey, Stuart, don’t care, it’s on site they gotta go!
right before scene with the couple fighting, Dylan misses the fact that there is a painter literally painting a portrait of a naked woman. (6:24) tf was disney on lmao. nonetheless this vid is hilarious as per usual
It's rated G cause kids could handle a lot more shit back when it came out lmao
33:10 no they didnt they just found out there were rats not that they were coooking DUDE
Dylan Talking about Boy meets World is everything. I need him in the Pod meets World Podcast to recap an episode 🤩 (this is okay I want him in a podcast, that’s not a video suggestion 😉🙃)
6:10 i saw a rat at my cousins house and fed it every day until it died
I love how Dylan gets shocked at different instances of violence throughout the video, yeah that has been other videos of him being excited about or wanting violence in a movie Lol 😂
Naur, if I see a mouse in my home, I’m taking it outside and letting it go
Literally am buying humaine mousetraps for my house because I don’t want to kill them. Not their fault they’re in the wrong place 🥺
Aaah.. A Movie Commentary Monday on A MONDDAYY..
The French are definitely wild people. I have many traumatic memories of getting into my friend's car in Nice and he was just piss drunk driving. Every night I thought this is how I die, but the fucker somehow evaded every obstacle with sheer luck. And that's when I realized... they are all piss drunk behind the wheel. And idk why it keeps working.  The plague is trandmitted via flees btw, those are carried by rats :) rats and mice are prone to carrying hanta viruses which is why their droppings must be cleaned out of living spaces
33 minutes of Dylan renaming the characters:
This was literally my fave film for soooo long. I loved this video omg
I actually live in Paris and I'm not gonna lie.. I felt attacked at 11:11 😭
I never realized how… bold ratatouille was for a G movie lol. And dylan’s sponsorship transition was as seamless as usually
The Moose tangent was absolutely needed. Thanks is for the woods warning, Dylan!
The appartement is actually pretty big for a Paris apartment 😂 but the fridge right next to the kitchen, accurate 😅
You look like England football player Declan rice
Funfact since it was brought up: Asumptions are that rats technically didn't start the "black death"-plague. Or more acurately, wheren't at fault for it getting so wide spread. It where actually  fleas (and probably lice) that spread the diseas to humans becouse they had an easy time "jumping" from human to human.
Not Dylan finding the old woman sexy hahaha I’m here for this
Dylan is way to afraid of an animated shot gun to be American...
Dylan: A rat in a kitchen? Why would they do this? Dylan have you ever heard of the term irony?
Ratatouille is one of, if not, my absolute favorite movie of all time! 🐀 I’m quite happy to see you genuinely enjoying it. And yes, Collette is…..best girl. 🥵
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH I NEEDEDDDD THISSS
12:13 Me changing my major 8 times in college
I can tell you’re trying to sound like and act like pewdiepie. Stop
even my three year old sister likes to watch Dylan and think he's funny
“This movie is rated G, for GUIDANCE….”
Dylan giving up on the swallow joke felt so painful for him. Takes a lot of self control!
dylan do u know how hard we simp for you??? 32:05
Domesticated rats are very clean. They even groom themselves. Watching Remy wash his little hands with the drop of faucet water so was adorable. Also, rats didn't carry the black plague. it was the ticks and mites that carried it onto humans.
Please Please please, if you haven't already, I totally recommend that you watch Disney's Hunchback of Notre Dame. It is such an amazing movie and I'd love to see your reaction ^^
13:28 Goddammit Dylan  *likes video*
We need more than one day a week for reactions like these.
This was one of my favorite movies as a kid.  I actually saw it in theaters, which was unusual for my family. It also has a pretty fun ps2 game. Years later I got a pet rat partially because of this movie. It was a good pet, so no I didn't kill the rat in my home, lol
I'm no longer calling it a "pinch", I'm now forever calling it a "rat's throw"
Dylan realising he's Jacque 😆 took him long enough. And yes Dylan you deserve the girl
25:31 - This is probably my favorite Dylan moment ever now 😂
Hey Dylan, the only french people that have guns at their houses are hunters and neo nazis
Terrifying Fact: Moose can dive 40 Feet below water to eat lake floor plants, next time you swim in deep fresh water just remember a moose may be below you
I have a very rational fear of moose as a Dylan fan and a Canadian
Dylan as soon as he said “he’s a goofball with no talent” : 👁️👄👁️  😭😭😭 Dylan I fully believe you’ll find your Christina one day! You are very lovable
Ew who would kill a mouse if it’s in your house… I just put them outside
If “never let them know your next move” was a movie 😂
Lucky me it’s Monday now!
aahhhh, couldve made such a good f1 joke at 0:20 PIERRE GASLYYYY please say some1 understands this
Okay so this movie actually traumatized me and gas masks still freak me out thank you💀
"the worst appartement ever with the best view" welcome to Paris 😅😂🇫🇷
I love this movie so much and Dylan’s comment are gold. I love him watching animated movies way more than regular movies😂
dylan: has already seen movie also dylan: shook AF when he "predicts" things correctly
Finally!!!!!!
i cant be the only one who tried pulling my hair to see if my arms moved after watching this movie as a kid.
I didn’t click on this, I didn’t even know dillan posted. I was gonna watch a different video but YouTube glitched and suddenly I’m being yelled at about a rat named Pierre
"She likes when guys take it from her" - Dylan😂
I used to like this movie as a kid. But now I rewatch it with my younger siblings and my mom and each time I saw that PEST touching food I wanted to go in the movie and kill that rodent. As someone that love food but is really scared of getting food poisonned, I just can't watch that movie anymore.
19:41 what's funny is that "paper clip" is called "trombone" in french.
fyi, in order to use the space button to pause, you need to pause with the mouse first, then use the space button :)
“Stop with the violence I’m sick of seeing it” a few moments later… “SHOOT HIM SHOOT HIM” 😂
yo Dylan you skipped the dating montage but she did teach him to roller skate
7:02 funny thing about it — I think that’s the girl that works in the kitchen
"Booksmart" next time pls!!
I'll never get tired of commenting this: YOUR SPONSORSHIPS TRANSITIONS
Dylan, don't google the average ratio between rats and people in the cities, ever!
I cannot with him, even him saying "a rat's fist of Pepper" has me weak🤣.
Dylan contemplating commenting on “if I don’t love it I don’t swallow” was the best thing ever 😂😂
7:20 *Aaron Warner entered the chat*
This proves that when you're not looking for stuff it just comes to you, Dylan has been asking for violence and death in every movie, and alas, he has received it where he last expected it
As someone who loves this movie, I have found three mice in my room in the last week. And you best believe I murked all of ‘em
Dylan's predictions and the actual movie are completely different
12:13 Dylan: "I'm not a big history guy." Subtitles: "I'm not a big history gay."
DYLAN HOW IS YOUR SKIN SO CLEAR!!!!! I said it was bc you're pale on Twitter.......
22:12 I love how he makes the d joke but doesn't recognise that she looks down for a millisecond when he's saying that, LOL.
i hope you know i see you as a paternal figure
i saw 2 moose in person like 5 feet away from me while hiking and i can second that they are way larger and intimidating than you'd think
6:37 ffs Dylan 🤣
Why is Dylan so freaky 😂😂
Is it me, or has his consistent schedule become nonexistent after that one comment forever ago🤨⁉️
Gusteau literally died because he got a bad review from a harsh critic. Love the guy but that was pretty pathetic.
shave that beard now
Please react to eternal sunshine of the endless mind
Honestly, because of Ratatouille being one of my favorite movies, I have been wanting to get a rat as a pet for the longest time and call it Emile.... Just me.... Alright...
watching this as a french person is an experience
"She's probably in america. No it's FRANCE!" 🤣 Yeah I knew it was coming when she shot the spoon thing, I was like yeah he's going to like this lol
This is one of my favorite movies! Yay!
why is this man getting finer by the day
These are funny but I really like when you dive into the filmography. I would love to see your take on a more artsy movie like Mr nobody or everything everywhere all at once
"what am i good at" felttttt
this movie was so aesthetically pleasing, especially the scene where he runs through all the house......omg i love this movie
Dylan, I love your videos so much. I love them so much that I even enjoy watching you ruining my favorite movie of all time xD
Yes, the many moose in france
Im watching this while I eat, great experience
The eau in gusteau sounds like o like in “nope”
If Dylan is so surprised this movie was rated G wait till he finds out about the movie "9"
being french and hearing Dylan give the characters more french names than in the movie is pure gold XD we stan pierre and jacques even if rémy is a super french name too
Hey Dylan, did you realise the food critic is inspired from Dracula and even has a house thats shaped as a coffin if you watch carefully
Wait till you watch Anastasia
Dramatic pause.... Omg IT'S ME
Just saw this for the 1st time last week myself..I've BEEN SLEEPING HEAVY ON THIS 🐀🧀
Fun fact: Linguini has a really small goatee the entire movie. The fact that they bothered to animate something that most people didn't even notice.
The Frenchies representation in this video is just la crème de la crème I can't--
33 mins of italian mob jokes for a movie based in france, being turned on by violent women and rat slander…this is the content i signed up for
i FORGOT HOW ENTERTAINING RATATOUILLE IS.
I love how Dylan is always asking for murder and when the grandma brings out the gun, he's genuinely shook to the core. He really said "Thank God" when he thought it was an umbrella LMAOOO.
Dylan pointing out a good rack focus never gets old, love the passion behind it every time. Also gotta point out that this movie is like perfect for Dylan with the amount of violence in it ahahah I loved this commentary so much!
Love rats and mice never kill them in the house 🥺 saved a rat other day on the walk with my dog took little guy to the vet.
The fact that Dylan is trying to make this an Italian mob movie is serving Goncharov
New comfort video, thank Dylan :)
Can we just appreciate how handsome this man is for a sec like damn I feel seduced just looking at him
Boy meets world caused and solved a lot of the problems in my life
If he doesn't like rats in the kitchen i wonder how he feels about enchanted lmao
Yes!! Waited for ur video
LOVE THIS MOVIE & YOUR REACTION, i 100000% recommend Disney’s Brother Bear it’s amazing and would love to see your reaction
4:17 I loved the PSA about moose
Ommmggggggg my stomach hurts from laughing so hard at Dylan’s face when he saw the gun 😂😂😂😂
Yes, the Italian movie Ratatouille, with a mob and a rat named Pierre 😂
4:00 this whole scene and Dylan’s dialogue TOOK ME OUT
No, Dylan. I don't kill the mice in my house. My cats do. The problem is that they're lazy, so I am a much more efficient mouse catcher. I have a jar I upgraded to be a very basic house for small rodents, and I catch the mice and put them there until I have the opportunity to release them. Violence is a choice, Dylan. It also has nothing to do with this movie =)
Just wanted to say that the Brazilian Portuguese dubbing of this movie is immaculate and makes everything thing better
*does an italian accent* movie is based in paris *gives one of the main characters a french name* his name is actually Alfredo Linguini (ie pretty italian) 10/10
One of my favorite animated movies. So good and so quotable! Lol
Anyone can cook  Dylan's broke ass french accent ; ANYTHING ANYTIME
32:10 Mood
As someone who is absolutely fascinated by animation I appreciate you for pointing out that detail in the beginning dylan
And now Dylan will never eat in a restaurant in France..... I swear we're not like this xD We 're violent though, but we can't have weapons, we need a licence and even with that it has to be justified =P
thank you dylan, for thanking us one moment and calling us psychopaths the next 14:40
rats are perfect little babies, the fleas in the rats started the plague 😭
Not me changing the volume up and down every few seconds because Dylan suddenly is screaming like a mad man.
I am not killing a mouse or a rat and thats not because of Ratatouille. It is because they are really big and also deserve to be caught and released into the wild again. :) Luckily I live under the roof of my building, so mice normally dont climb up here. :D
Anyone else notice how gewd Dylan looks 🧐... Like Grown Grown😌
you should watch flushed away next its a classic
I kind of expect the scraggly facial hair on Ooga Booga but not this channel.
dylan, my beloved, we don't have much moose in france
I just wanna leave this here: Save By the Bell is far superior to Boy Meets World. Still, I love both shows.
A mind like an iron sieve.
6:27  Dylan complaining about the violence in the movie but completely missing the fully nekkid woman painting in the shot before xD
"Is that a shotgun ?" "Oh it's not thank god-- AAAAAAA NOOOO !!!" Best sequence ever.
Real talk for a sec, thank you so much for sharing content with us Dylan. It means more than you will ever know.
I swear you’ve done this before. I remember your reactions?
Freaking love your videos! I would love to see your reaction to “Train to Busan” it was one of my favourites this year!
not me having to recalibrate remy and linguini's names to pierre and jacques HAHAHAH
Dylan: I don’t think violence is good.  * few minutes later*   Dylan: Shoot him! SHOOT HIM!
You almost got how the plague started. It was from the fleas on rats not the rats themselves
The fact that Dylan is single baffles me, if you’re ever in Europe.. call me 📞 ☎️ 😌
I thought you had a girlfriend Dylan?
25:35 ahahah
If you want a little bit of a history lesson of the plague, watch the short video. That should be included with the movie
As far as I know, Ratatouille was originally a cheap easy meal to make for a lot of people, because it’s really just mixing veggies in a pot, that’s why when the critic gets the fancy version of the ratatouille, it reminds him of his childhood, because it was already a popular dish among struggling families, likely something he ate a lot if he grew up without a lot of money
Who knows Remy the rat, I only know Pierre the rat
Domestic rats are actually really clean, they groom themselves. Assuming Remy is living with Linguini, he shouldn't have disease carrying fleas or be in contact with any other diseases.
Do a bollywood movie
I have one criticism: I get that this movie isn't very realistic, but dishwashers in restaurants tend to be at a pretty hot temperature. Around like 50-90 degrees C for hygiene reasons, and I'm pretty sure that's enough to hurt a lot - trust me, I've handled dishes that came fresh out of the dishwasher... it's an owie and a half. So for them to be inside through the whole cycle? That's animal abuse right there...   However, this is also one of Dylan's best commentaries, hands down.
I love when you react to animations
YOU ARE SOOOO chaotic 😭😭😭😭
Do BOY MEETS WORLD REACTIONS PLEASE
This video is genuinely my favorite video from Dylan, 10000/10
I have a mouse in my house, probably several. I just called him Jerry and moved on. Even our cat didn't care
As a person who worked in multiple restaurants.. mouses are ALWAYS there..
Not me watching this in the middle of college, dude it’s been so long i kinda missed you
best review you've ever posted this year
Fun fact: There really is a shop in Paris with dead rats hanging on the display called Aurouze. They have 21 dead rats hanging by their neck, crushed by steel traps. They’ve been there since 1925.
Bow down to the master of ad segways
My name is Christina. If anyone ever calls me collette, I’m gonna think of dylan 😂
4:28 Yes I've seen a moose, I've seen many. Last time I saw 2. I live in the woods of Sweden basically. I see at least one moose per year. Am I gonna have a whole tedtalk about moose in Sweden? We had a very strong moose population in especially the 80's or smth (idk I was born in the 2000's). Now the population has gone down, there's still alot of them but in the 80's there was so many that there was one like behind every other tree lol. They're even gotten the name "King of the woods" here. Because they (male) wear a "crown" y'know. Anyway they're chill as long as you don't piss them off. They just walk around slowly and eating their leaves and such stuff. They're basically a cow but forest type.  Did you know they get drunk of overly-ripe apples? There's videos on yt lmao. There's also a video of a moose fighting one of those robotic lawnmowers. That moose was mad mad.
Dylan in past videos: "When is someone gonna die? I need someone to die"  Dylan in THIS video: *surprised pikachu face* WhY iS tHiS sO vIoLeNt?!!  Dylan 10 minutes later: SHOOT EM!!!
Dylan in every commentary "more violence". Dylan, when a movie has violence: "why is this movie so violent"
The hanging dead rat shop actually exists in Paris
Friendly reminder for everyone: Don't watch Dylan in the middle of the night without headphones - because you're gonna either have an heart attack or wake your neighboors... or both  Edit: You can get an heart attack if you use headphones too tho, sorry for bad advice
Not dylan just hittin on all the women
Whenever Dylan utters the word “book” , I immediately know that we are getting an audible sponsor
man's just cheered when Linguini checked his waistband  i'm-
Sees that Dylan has uploaded a new video, stops working on college essay (due tmr) to watch his video :)))
I once was up a mountain at midnight and accidentally woke a sleeping moose and it was one of the scariest moments of my life
Just to answer his question... I do love all animals (except mosquitos) so I just put traps for mice, I've liberated more mice than the ones my cat has killed, so I'm proud of that. And before you ask, I live in the middle of the woods, so animals entering the house can be quite common.
This was phenomenal and brought me back to the gloriousness that was “Ratatouille the Tiktok Musical” during quarantine.
Hi Dylan ! I’m French. Just so you know, it is not that rare to see grandparents and old people in the French countryside having weapons. Either A) The grandma’s a hunter or a hunter’s wife or B) her family went to war or helped some Jews hide in their home or helped the Resistance at the time (i.e. Hiding weapons). Having her wear a gaz mask and a helmet makes me think it’s the latter 😊 It is not that long ago (a month or so) that SOME regions were asked to give their weapons to authorities. Only a few hundreds were landed.
I must be the only person who doesn't like Ratatouille and doesn't get it. I still watched this whole vid though and only cause its a movie commentary Monday and gotta applaud Dylan for his consistent upload every Monday.
i have never seen dylan enjoy a movie more than he did this one and it’s lowkey unsettling
21:53 Nahhh Dylan I neverrr seen u act like this! LMAOO you eating this UPP
my favourite videogame as a kid was the one of this movie and i grew up to have pet rats and i never really thought about it but mayhbe there was smthn there
"I've seen this film, I remember a lot "  Proceeds to put on the fakest Italian accent while the movie is set in France
Him calling Remy, Pierre. But also him forgetting the nickname and calling him Remy again when he talks about how much mre interesting it would be if Remy didn't talk
i’m commenting before i watch this but i bet a million dollars dylan is attracted to the emo french girl.
I..wanna see a moose now
I''m French and Italian, I've never felt so connected to a video from Dylan haha
My Life is better seeing you 🤧🤧🤍🤍💘💘💘
PLEASEE WATCH THE BEE MOVIE🐝😆
The plague didn’t start by rats, it was spread by them
"that is some 1446 shit" that store is actually there in Paris till this day. With the hanging rats from 1925.
6:27 his face😂
you look old for someone who's just 20yo
The gun umbrella double jumpscare was a masterpiece lmao
Please review The Emperor's New Groove!
I like the measurement "rat fist"
for a movie he's seen before, this is the most shocked and emotive I've seen Dylan during a commentary vid XD
Watch Brother Bear !!!
Solo lo quiero encima 😫😫😫 ta demasiao bello
i’ve never clicked so fast I MEAN ITS DYLAN AND MY FAVE MOVIES OF ALL TIME
When i was younger i had little rats as pets, and they were absolutely adorable 10/10 i love this movie
Thats my favorite movie
I'm glad Dylan realized he is just like Linguini, the second he had the same reaction as Linguini to "Christina" knifes I knew they were the same person hahaha his videos bright my day <3
I love it when a “that’s what she said” moment comes around and Dylan just stares at the camera 😏 challenging us to say it
WAIIIIT,  IS THAT THE OLD LADY FROM MADAGASCAR?? 4:00
To answer your question, you are good at vocab!🤣
I haven't seen this movie in a few years and I don't remember this movie being so aggressive and sexual aggressive. Like Collette moaned when they kissed. I'm floored. I'm also questioning France's gun laws.
dylan being a boy meets world fan is one of my favourite things ever
I love how Dylan clowns on Linguini, but he looks just like him
What are her great qualities? You didnt elaborate. ^_~
Review white lotus
This was one of the most entertaining commentaries yet!!!
👀 At 592,800 square kilometres (228,900 sq mi) Madagascar is the world's second-largest island country, after Indonesia.
The lack of body control or at least the ability to give up body control and just go limp for linguini is honestly insane like how does his body just move like that when his hair is pulled. Medically, what's wrong with this guy?
I just read Maus for class and seeing that dead rat scene just gave it a whole new meaning
This is my favorite animated movie! The first time I saw it was on a trip with my grandmother (who brought the movie and a player) and my mom and sisters out of the kids, I was the only one who stayed wake for the whole movie and I wanted to watch it on the way back home. It still makes me laugh even though I can quote parts of it perfectly.
I just KNEW Collette would be dylans cup of tea
I found your channel earlier in the week and can say that your commentary is hilarious. It's like having a conversation with a friend.
I wish Dylan had noticed the artist at 6:23 was painting nude portraits to add onto his speech about this movie being G rated
I really thought I was watching one of his old videos back. It was only around the audible sponsored segment that I realised I hadn’t seen this before, lmao.
22:11 cant believe you missed the adult joke, you literally covered it woth your face
ı love whenever see a old woman he goes ' girl ' but for the young girls never says a nice thing :D :D :D
Never thought I would walk away from a Disney movie reaction with the implication that Dylan’s into pegging… but here we are. ❤
Ratatouille is literally coded for racism, took me a while to realise that
This was uploaded 5am Australian time. It was actually a movie commentary Monday!!
this is my favorite review from him cause this movie was so funny and dylan enjoyed it 99% of the time, also reminded me how funny this movie can be
Disney rats are immortal — ask cousin Mickey
The G rating is for guns not guidance
Still waiting for Kung Fu Panda 2!
Disliked for the rat hate
dylan and remy (im sorry, pierre) in one vid, my day just got a whole lot better
The amount of shame I have for not seeing I was blessed with another Dylan video sooner is honestly sad 😪
I’m French and hearing the voice in English is highly cringey 😂😂 makes me,laugh love your videos man
Us dylan is in trouble fans are built different because we have such good humor that most people can't understand (Also a big ego)
I think Dylan has a thing for older fictional women…
Okay, gotta love the: Dylan freaking out: why does this woman have a gun!?  Dylan: Oh, she’s probably American *calmly cause that makes sense* Dylan freaking out again: No wait SHES IN FRANCE WHY DOES SHE HAVE A GUN!?!?  😂
Rats and humans having a lot of similarities really makes this movie even more interesting
I have a pet rat, I love her. she is an idiot
Ratatouille is originally made as a peasant dish, which just means it was a stew made mostly by the lower class due to it’s cheap ingredients, anyways, it’s actually the dinner Anton Ego’s mother makes for him in his flashback when he tries Remy’s remastered version
Pretty sure it takes place in france 🫡
I had 2 pet rats growing up... they lived for 7 years
dylan you should make a series where you react to a music artist. listen to like 5-10 songs and rate the artist overall. i feel like it would make a lot of people mad
still waiting for a stranger things 3-4 season reaction dylannn
I use live traps for mice cuz I live in a smaller town so we just release em like 20 mins away, we also don't get rats really. But rats get the smoke on sight
dylan's ever evolving bit about not remembering names then renaming characters and now not remembering the names he gave to the characters? impeccable
Turtles?!🤣
Dylan at 12:09 :How do you think the plague started??? Me in The Professor from Puppet History's voice: RATS!!!!!
I love this movie ughh my favorite disney movie this and lady and the tramp
My favorite Pixar movie
25:31 I DIED 😂
the fact that dylan didn’t see colette quickly look down at linguini’s 😏 when he said “i have a tiny little” makes me sad (22:11) that scene always makes me chuckle
Dylan..where’s your book. It’s been years.
First it was Travis. Then Pierre. What Disney Animal is he going to “nickname” next
Ratatouille is one of the greatest animated films out I love every aspect of it especially when the food inspector flashbacks to his childhood.
Come on dylan there’s so much good movies for you to watch
dylan: always wants violence in disney/pixar movie  dylan seeing violence in pixar movie: 😧
Bravo!!! 👏🏽 Bravo!! 👏🏽 Another brilliant review on a wonderful movie!     You are one of the best and I look forward to every one of your videos!   Thank you for the laughs 🥰🫵🏽👍🏽
I would suggest Dylan looks up how Michelin star restaurants in NYC prepare for inspection, if he's freaked out about this amount of rats in restaurants 😂
I didn't know 🐀 live that short. Fun fact indeed 😂
Seeing Dylan pause to appreciate the interesting camera angles and film techniques, as well as some of the risky jokes, has made my whole day!
broo im getting emotional seeing dylan's account grow😭😭😭😭😭😭 so proud of you!!
I am not the only one who knew Dylan would love Collette the second he started watching this lol
the confidence with the “PIERRE”
"He's a redhead who has a hair-pulling kink" Oh yeah, pull my linguine mmm
Dylan...That beard suits you so well
You like getting spank by a woman don’t you Dylan? Lol
Had Dylan seen bee movie because I feel like after this its required?!
Ratatouille is my favorite movie ever
28:51 dated a French girl, the answer is yes.
Remi being silent is such a great idea lol
Found a mouse in my house and I tried to feed it and keep it in a diy cage, but it died anyway 😢
The moment I clicked on this video, I knew Dylan would react like this when Colette showed up. Always a pleasure to see you react to violent and agressive women, Dylan!
12:13 I could've cried I thought he was reading a log from my journal 🥲
the rare actual monday movie commentary
I wonder if Dylan would like the movie emperors new groove?
just 11:42 with no context🤣😂
Yeah, that granny with the shotgun action was kinda sexy... But even more so: that segue into the sponsor
Fun fact that Rat poison store is a real place in France and the hanging rat corpses are I think 100 years old. The shop is called Julien Arouze and Co
I live for the quote “anyone can cook”. If there’s any reason to watch the movie, it’s literally for that quote.  Living my life that way! 😂
fun fact: the shop with the hanging rats (20:10) is actually a real place in Paris! It's called Aurouze and they have a bunch of dead rats hung up on display from 1925.
Je suis La Ratatouille 🐀 👩‍🍳
Dylan you thinking boy meets world is superior to Saved by the bell might be one of your only or biggest red flags 🚩 not even comparable. Saved by the bell>>>
I have been waiting for him to watch this movie, finally lol
Need more Dylan please
1:24 into this and I’m already dying of laughter
I had to watch it today again. Simply because it feels cool to hear you say my name 🤷🏻‍♀️😂 I am Kristýna.
I can't tell if you read comments for video inspirations but here goes "Not Another Teen Movie"
21:17 dylan joking about colette falling for remy reminded me so much of bee movie lmaooooo
I used to love this movie as a child but the first scenes always made me  so sad Also fun fact, the place with the dead rats hanging  is real/inspired by a real shop Edit: i had to look it up, the shop is called Aurouze
I need a sequel just about Pierre, Jacque, Christina and their ties to the mob
19:49 caught me off guard SO much 😄!
I think it’s amazing how he so clearly loved this film so much
“Who gave this woman a gun?" *processing* "Oh she’s probably in America” *processing* “No that’s France!” You’re hilarious I swear
I am really curious , what is his MBTI , any idea guys ?
Fuck yes!
2:05 I was eating supper and just heard, "This is my brother– a meal."  A real rat eat rat world we live in, huh.
fun fact my aunt lives in alaska and has called off work before bc she had a moose chilling in her driveway BIGGER THAN HER CAR that wouldn't move for hours. AND HER WORK IS LIKE "YEAH STAY HOME WE'LL PAY YOU"
thank you dylan for warning us about moose
It’s the bde
Dylan's aversion to the word meese haha
Can someone send this to Noah Schnapp so that he can finally watch Ratatouille?
Can confirm that I found a rat on my bed chowing down on my chocolate and I screamed. No hesitation, I grabbed my knife and tried to attack it. This movie is one of my favorites of all time, but I won’t hesitate to slit a real rat
29:36 Loving this point cuz I never thought about it. Know l remember and say that's she kinda did?   24:27 I guess he actually had a skill.  29:52...Nevermind....
Why can't we just love each other for fucks sake, go on picnics and hold hands, overthrow the government and watch the rat movie that makes food, rattatoot-toot and kiss under the bicycle racks at walmart
The universe changed his course when dylan didn’t say that’s what she said at “when I don’t love it I don’t swallow”😂😂😂🤦🏻‍♀️
The moment of realization for Dylan as it dawned on him that he was Remi, felt like that moment in a movie when everything falls into place 😂😂😂😂
Dylan calling moose terrorists is just 👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾  Also, I don't kill rodents, just catch them and relocate them. A bunch of stray cats run these streets, so I don't see many.
Dylan could be a Pixar character
Love that Dylan seems to like women who put him in his place 😍😍
Dylan: And literature, I do struggle with. Me: Is that why the book isn’t done yet?
He be reacting to videos and I’m like wait he hasn’t already?? I’m pretty sure I saw… wait huh.??
Lmao the town never found out it was rats cooking, just that the restaurant was infested with rats. Thats how Ego lost his credibility
The accent hahaha love it
I lived in an appartment where the bathroom was right next to the kitchen. The toilet was next to the refrigerator separated by 6 inches of wall 🤣
Turtles.
I hope Dylan doesn’t see this because of the ‘No Recs’ rule…but I think it would be insanely funny if he were to react to an Indian television series😅
at this point i can see the audible transitions coming from a mile away
32:06 Dylan, have you forgotten about the thousands of simps on twitter 😂
Dylan, may i ask WHAT'S THAT IN YOUR FACE? 😅😂
where can I get the sweater he wore in the ad read
spent the weekend at a really long & difficult shoot (for a student film) and seeing that dylan uploaded when i got back made my day. thank you sir 🫡❤️
Let me tell you I GASPED when I saw this thumbnail! I’ve been waiting for this moment!!!!!!   ❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Dylan's inability to remember any essential element of any film he's watched is a talent
This movie makes me want to try ratatouille’s
4:01
His moustache in this video is *chef's kiss*
Please watch "Wednesday".
i know it was leading into a sponsorship, but the fact that the only thing that worried you about losing your fingers was being able to read a book?
“literature i do struggle with” on an unrelated note how’s that book coming along dylan
listen to twilight? bold of u to assume i dont already own all of the books
I can’t believe no one has ever warned me about Moose
I was today years old when I realized, yes, Saved By the Bell did suck, I just had a huge crush on most of the cast. Thank you Dylan.
Dylan actually uploading a movie on a movie Monday?!? Impossible!
i was opening a tab to look up "do books float" and dylan also did it immediately we both needed to know
I’m 90% sure the old lady at the beginning is 100% German
"Why does she have a shotgun!? This must be America!... No wait it's France!"🤣
it's a French dish
I watched this movie for the first time some days ago and as soon as Linguini showed up I went AWOOOOOOOGA 😳. Dumb clumsy idiots are just 🥵🥵🥵🥵 my girl christina knows.
I really love when Dylan talks about the filmmaking aspect. This man has watched so much content it's almost like he went to film school or something.
I love that Dylans clearly a sub
Ahhh finally 🤗
it was a rat, you were right. rats caused the plague because of their coat, I think. it wasn't a rat per say, but what was on the rats that got people think.
dylan: im not a big history guy subtitle: im not a big history gay
Dylan now: stop with the violence, there’s enough in the world already  Dylan during zootopia: not enough nuclear warfare 1/10
You gotta react to the princess and the frog 🐸 🎉
i still kill it but i feel bad about it afterwards
the disturbing part is that the rat extermination store is a real store in Paris
DYLAN PLEASE REACT TO THE GOLDFINCH YOU MIGHT REGRET IT LOL
All the calendars around me are wrong, they’re saying today is Sunday but Dylan posted so it's clearly Monday
TURTLES!
man this brought back memories, anyone else play the game?? i remember it being a blast to play but also a pain😆
In high school my biology teacher played this show called monster inside me before lunch. One episode this couple had pet rats and one of T hem got some illness from rats and didn’t want to believe they’re rats did it because they got their shots and they loved them. It was from some stray rats when they cleaned their workplaces attic and in the end so they didn’t get rid of them. Made me itchy
3:56 - 4:12 Dylan!! This whole segment 😭💀 Literally looks and sounded like something out of a cartoon!
The scene with the old woman and her shotgun was such an emotional roller-coaster Dylan 😂😂😂
a rat's fist is my new favourite unit of measurement
I LOVE RATATOUILLE! I’m so stoked for this one.  6:09 - I would get rid of it, yes- 😅 10:48 - Aww I love Patton 15:40 17:05 - Dylan pls 💀✋🏽 17:58 - Reasons why I love this movie 25:38 - 💀💀💀 25:51 - 😭✋🏽 32:12 - DYLAN NO 😭  Loved it 🫡😮‍💨👏🏽
This movie scarred me as a child so much that my type is now skinny white boys with curly red hair whose only redeeming qualities is that they could potentially be in organized crime.  Send help
I know realize how much guns there is in this movie and I wonder why because I live in Paris and I've never ever saw anyone owning a gun   I mean the old lady might be valid but the couple ¿¿¿ like idk if it was supposed to be relatable but I guess for Americans cause dang
Did I miss the criteria of where exactly we're supposed to *feel* sound effects in order for them to be successful?? 😂
you gotta watch Your Friend The Rat mini film from Pixar. 'Pierre' is the main dude.
6:37 Dylan going on a bs rant about how he hates how much violence is in movie studios as if he isn’t constantly wishing death upon most characters in any film he sees 😂
From someone living in Maine, where moose are the state animal, I appreciate someone talking about the danger and hazard a moose can be!
Oh shoot I missed school I didn’t realize it was Monday thankyou Dylan for the consistant uploads this really helps with my scheduling ❤ 😂
"Disney's taking risks" he says about a Pixar film from 2007. Dylan is so fun to watch cause one second he's saying the absolute smartest thing, and the next he says the most braindead thing, and he's serious about both.
Can we talk about how excited Dylan got by a guy opening is pants? 😂
As someone who absolutely loves ratatouille, I can assure you that yes I will still kill one if I found it one my house.
Dylan having a hard time figuring out why hot girls like goof balls with no talent
Ive never killed a mouse or rat. I’ve always caught them and taken them to a park to release them 😂
Did Dylan miss the joke when linguini says “I have a little” and then she looks down at his pants it’s the funniest part 😂
When I was in classes at Le Cordon Bleu chef told us "the higher the hat, the more important the chef." It doesn't seem that way in this movie. Lol
👏
Dylan in any other movie: I crave more violence, give me blood !  Ratatouille: has guns  Dylan:  >:O
Omg Dylan changing all the names confused me so much haha. Calling Remy by Pierre is a crime
react to the new teen wolf movie trailer, i'd like to see that lol :)
i always regret opening dylans comment section. they always manage to gaslight me into thinking he actually posts every monday and it fucks up my sense of time
Ratatouille is the best movie ever made
Dylannnn— I love your commentaries. I’m out of words at this point lol
8:55 killed me because he’s so right. A little rat handful of some basil and spices isn’t going to change anything
Dylan asking if anyone who liked this movie would let a mouse live freely inside their home.... laughs in we've had a mouse inside the house for two years now and no one wants to kill it so we just let him roam around at nights*
Omg yess boy meets world is a classic ive been rewatching eps this week and now dylan talks about it wtff
Dylan solves world hunger
Dylan: Are French ppl really that aggressive. Me: Did you not watch the England v France game? Even the ref who’s Brazilian was French that night😭
i still have to watch the video, i swear if you don’t like it i will unfollow you dylan.
dylan + audible = forever
Dylan Jump scares make this whole video so much better.😂😂😂😂
Dylan is looking more and more fine with each video and I just wanted to point that out
I MISSED YOU, Dylan! 🥹🫶🏽
28:02 the way the music stops for just a second when he goes “what?” and then resumes again is just so perfect lmao
Thank you for posting when I am alone and in need of something to get my mind off of my sickness.
Because those were moose-lims
i miss dylan (i’m watching him right now)
2:43 HIS NAME IS Pierre😂😂😂😂 that killed me!!!
In one of the scenes where they show chef Gusteau, a mouse shadow is clearly seen in the hat.  And when they do the DNA test there was a mouse hair in that hat as well as his hair, so probably the chef too was guided by a mouse like Remì guides Linguini.  And another interesting thing is that if you pay attention to the house when the critic was a child, it's the same house as the crazy old woman from the beginning of the film
In school, there was a time where we could watch a movie and our class voted. The movie had to be rated G. We watched ratatouille and like you, I was surprised it wasn't at least PG-13. The animated Aladdin was also a choice though and that movie had that scene at the end (you know, with the hourglass) so maybe Disney and Pixar just call all their films G even if they are pushing the line. I also think if those movies were made now they would have been cleaner. I think Pixar might've stayed the same but Disney literally remade Aladdin, and took that scene out.
Dylan has a type. Crazy. This video confirms it. 15:40
i appreciate how every time i check there's more and more supermega and jerma-like super honest comments, i wish dylan was real and not just a figment of our collective consciousness
The whole time Dylan is saying Pierre and Jaques I'm like "Who?" Lol
Fun fact: 20:10 that shop exists in Paris and it looks just like that, they do have on display dead hanging rats
As much as I, as an Italian, appreciate the colors of Italy in the background, perhaps you should have used the colors of the French flag for your lamps.
27:52 yes, he does! in the montage with Collette aka "Christina", we see he can roller-skate. other than that, i got nothing lol. definitely a top tier Pixar movie for sure, but this commentary made it even better.
Boy Meets World continues to be great, I've been listening to the podcast Pod Meets World -its hosted by some of the main cast with lots of guest stars (not just actors) who were involved in the show
I’ve had pet rats for over a decade, they’re actually incredibly smart and sweet. You can even train them to fetch and do things a dog can do! Wild rats can carry diseases, sure, but domesticated rats and mice are usually safe if they bite/scratch you- which is a rare thing. In my decade of having them, I’ve only ever had one rat that would bite.
Dylan : If you find a rat in your kitchen you could shut a restaurant down  Every restaurant in Paris : .......
Such a good video Dylan! I was entertained all the way through.
yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee love this vid
can you react to up or inside out you may cry or laugh 👀
24:28 the clown in the background is the same guy from the incredibles boń voyage
At like 20 min bro said Pierre and I was like who tf is that
I feel like pixar always had more courage than disney. Pixar's jokes were always funnier. In my opinion, pixar is better
Please note, this was made by PIXAR not Disney
*Dylan at first explaining how he doesn’t understand why Colette likes Linguini bc he has no talent* Me: “oh so like you?” *Dylan later realising* Me: damn satisfied
genuine question: where is your couch? 👁👄👁
“He has a hair pulling kink” I mean…. He’s not wrong
One natural predator of the Moose is the Killer Whale
Whats a dylan video without an audible ad
I know you don't take recommendations, but like...   Up     Just saying
Me, not paying attention for a second because I was talking to my cat Dylan: Christina! Me: WHAT?
Don't tell me he has make the lights green and red in order to resemble the Italian flag
another slightly dark but interesting thing about this movie is that they added blemishes such as cuts to the chefs hands to make it more realistic
We’re gonna need another video with Pretty much it again soon you guys as a trio are too much🤣🤣
Hearing Dylan say the name Cristina is the best thing ever ahahha
idk man, rats that arent forced to live in the nasty shit that humans create are actually really clean🤔
Dylan I wanted to say that the technical movie stuff is really fun and interesting 😁😁😁 for example : the rack focus   (I want to be a filmmaker so I get very excited every time you say stuff like this)
32:06 😂😂😂😂😂 dude stop I’m dyingggg lol
She's like 187 years old. Dylan, come on!😂😂😂😂
How tf is Ratatouille the movie where Dylan draws the line on violence?
just moved to Paris and saw some places with rat corpses in their windows, it's actually real and so disgusting
The colors in the background are the colors of the french flag did you plan this
OK Dylan, my one bone to pick with you is that there is an established connection between Colette and linguini before their kiss. First he visibly swoons as you do when we first meet Colette. Then he thanks her for her advice and actually respects her as a woman in the kitchen, so that really endeared her to him.
I love him the way you love a favorite show
Dylan Is In Trouble and Casual Geographic doing their best and warning the world of the dangers of moose.
You have no idea how I was waiting for his upload. God.
YOU NEED TO WATCH MOTHER !!!
Dude I love this movie, but when I was at university we had a really bad mouse infestation in our house and we put traps fucking ALL OVER the place. I think we caught like 13 mice altogether in the end. I had to empty the traps because I was the only person in the house not scared of mice. Good times.
“I love it. Drive him insane.” 😂😂😂😂😂😂
This is the best Pixar movie.
Don't worry, you are a man of man talents. The only reason why youre single is because youre too great and impressive
The rat-killing shop is real, you cab find it in paris. And yes, they hang dead rats just like that in front of the windows
“Is that a shotgun?…oh it’s an umbrella, thank Go—oh, whoa! Where did she get a gun!?”😂
As a Canadien, yes Dylan, i have seen a moose before, it was quite large
15:37 You crack me up bro 😂😂😂😂 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Dylan: “I’m not a big history guy. I’m not a big math or science guy either.” Me: “ah, so you’re little then…”
Dylan....seriously we NEED you to review "Boy Meets World"!!!! We all need your expert opinion on this marvelous show!!!!
We must all fear moose
'Oh she's probably american' That's not the right mindset Dylan😭
I could see this being G considering if you go to Disney Springs (Downtown Disney) they have dead geese / ducks hanging in a window like for sale
His name is Remy 😡
Not Dylan calling the rats from ratatouille "mice" ☠
I love this movie and have an affinity for rats and mice. I have several... and my rat cages are in my kitchen... so I have rats in the kitchen, and allow them to free roam my apartment.   Also, I catch and release the deer mice that get in my apartment. 🤣😂 Dylan attacked who I am as a person. I feel judged. 🤣
It's not Ratatouille, it's Raccoonie!!
It annoys me that Collette takes charge of the new dish at about 18:47. Like, they requested LINGUINI to make the dish and she's taking charge and telling Linguini/Remy no
im sorry but i always thought she would straight peg him thats how the relationship dynamic goes dont @ me
Dylan: i dont support violence  *few moments later* Also dylan: shoot him
I think the most popular theory is that the good childhood memory was the house the rats lived in originally ! That’s how he knew how to cook it exactly the same.
Just a suggestion for you, watch the Incredibles on the channel, I think you’ll enjoy it if you haven’t seen it already
“How do you think the plague started? Rats.” Very funny considering there’s a dvd special feature wherein Remy explains why the plague is not their fault
I just finished watching this and i miss him already
hands up if you KNEW gas mask granny would turn Dylan on
9:14 😂😂😂 when he jumped I DIED
WATCH THE NICKELODEON MOVIE SPECTACULAR! THAT WOULD BE SO FUNNY TO SEE YOUR REACTION
Dylan's reaction to Collette tells you everything you need to know if you aren't aware of his thing for murderous women
"A rat's throw" that is now an official unit of measurement XD
I was a little reluctant to watch since I was still a little annoyed after DWD but I agree, Boy Meets World is a superior show
Dylan will meet his future wife when she drops her bag and couple of knives fall out.
I can’t believe it’s Monday already
Dylan: “who gave this woman a gun, oh she’s probably in america” Me: i said the same thing😂
20:11 fun fact this store is actually based of a real store in France.
Movie: made in france with french characters  Dylan: *making italian jokes* 😂😂
I'm now going to be replacing "a pinch of" with the phrase "a rat's fist of" when I cook
This guy is just American bbno$  Or an Aaron Taylor Johnson that went to YouTube
Sir, you post too seldom
definitely 100% not suggesting but violent night seems like your kinda film just saying (everyone is murdered)
really enjoying the new characters jacques and pierre
32:10 The moment Dylan finally figured it out LMAO
4:01 My dad once threw a baseball at a fly. (He REALLY hates flies.) It broke our living room window. When my mom started to yell at him, he got distracted by the fly buzzing past them. There are definitely wrong weapons for killing pests but some people don't seem to understand that LOL
Your glasses are crooked
This movie disgusts me. I can't get past a rodent being in the kitchen. I struggled watching it for the first time lol.
why are you happening to review all my favorite movies rn
Are those the new Sony headphones everyone is talking about? My anxiety ridden ass is looking for new headphones that are sound proof.
rats are extremely meticulous creatures, I'm glad they had Remy wash his hands and follow protocol. yes, wild rats are going to be full of fleas and bacteria, but if you observe domesticated rats or lab rats, you'll notice how often they're always cleaning themselves. and, fun fact, it was the fleas on the rats that caused the plague.
I bought my dad a bracelet for his birthday that says 'Moose bites kann be pretti nasty' because its a monty python quote and also, he must be aware of this danger
oh so he was being serious when thought about making kids content
We need a movie about an evil moose now
as a teen i relate so much with this young funny man with a nose piercing, watching his movies every monday
About Remy’s (the rat’s) lifespan: I had a pet rat when I was younger. They told us she’d live about 2 years she ended up living 6 years. Until she had a tumor and we had to put her down. She was so precious though, miss her. 😌💙✨
Guys, we need to find Dylan a girl 😅 it’s getting sad now, I’m sorry. I still love you, Dylan🥰😘
as an ukranian my soul left my body at 1:24. It was tooooo reall
Dylan you're getting mixed up, Linguini (Jacque) already knew how to roller-skate, he tried teaching Colette (Christina) earlier in the movie but it was to hard for her...😂
Dylan's reaction to Colette is priceless 🤣
29:40 Pretty sure they did have a scene of the love interests rollerskating together. Christine was actually bad at it and Linguini helped her.
I just love u Dylan.. you’re the cutest, should I had said..funniest? LoL nah, fr it’s love..❤🐭
Wait dylan is Single???? I thought he was engaged or smt
25>38 KSDJSJHDS DYLAN
This was so validating to watch my favorite commentator speak highly about my favorite disney movie (and no, we ratatouille fans still think rats r gross)
the lore of dylan getting turned on by dominant women continues, and it knows no boundaries.
ratatouille is one of my top animated films out there, so I was very excited and very nervous about this commentary. but goddamn was it fun. also, as soon as dylan said that granny with the gun was "scornful" I knew fully well what was coming next LMFAO.
it's always good to see dylan watching a movie and laughing from actual enjoyment instead of as a coping mechanism
Wait until Dylan learns that the dead rats shop really exist in Paris
do a reaction on sex lives of college girls...
DO THE SUMMER I TURNED PRETTY! ITS ON PRIME
I loved the cinematography comments on this one! Also crushing hard on Colette it's such a mood
Fun fact about the shop in 20:08 min with the dead rats. It exists in real life, it's a shop called Aurouze at Paris (8 Rue des Halles). Which makes Dylan's horrified reaction x100 far better hahahahaha
I love holiday movies like Ratatouille!  I also love Mondays!!
One of my favorite movies… and when it came out, I believe I was taking French in high school… actually yea.. because we asked the teacher what was Ratatouille!
When I went to Paris as a child I actually saw a shop with all the dead rats hanging in the window, it was quite a shock
this morning i was on tiktok and saw a theory about this movie. You know Ego says at the end that the ratatouille recipe reminded him of the one his mom used to make? (there's also the flashback scene with him and his mum in the countryside). At the beginning of the film, Remy and Emile are seen in a house in the country with an old lady. Many think that this is Ego's mother and that Remy made the same recipe, with the same taste, because he saw the lady doing it and maybe even tasted it
They didn't know the rats cooked the food, they just knew the rats were in the kitchen. Which is why ego lost his credibility, cuz he rated a restaurant with rats so well
A random comment
This film is a cultural reset
you're single? how lol
I'd do anything to see Dylan reacting to Jessica Rabbit in "Who Framed Roger Rabbit"
Dylan having a kink for dangerous/violent/powerful women is my favourite thing
About rat or mouse situation at house. When I was like 10 years old, we had a cat and in summer times she would constantly bring life mouses into the house (NOT RATS) and I always thought how beautiful they were and wanted to keep some hahaha. My mom would always freak out and I was the one to catch them and place back to the forest near by. (I picked them with a jar, since we never knew if they are healthy or not)
dude this video made me so happy, dylan is my actual favorite
Daylaaaaannnn! I missed you🥲
this is gonna be good
Am I the only one that expects all YouTube videos to end with a tootles? 🤣🤣🤣
dylan’s videos >>>>>
5 hours ago woah
can we please address Dylan's moose phobia
Dylan, laughing : "Is this his appartement ?" Parisians, crying... "we all have this, but without the view"
I love when you comment on the film making choices.
15:34 - 15:37 We ain't gonna talk about this? 🤣
The only reliable thing in my life is that Dylan consistently uploads every Monday. Without fail. Happy Monday everyone.
"How is this rated G-DISNEY!" ahhhhhh yes. Back when rated G and PG actually MEANT SOMETHING. Fun fact _The Lion King_ was also rated G. And we all know what death happened in that flick.
Dylan: "I'm playing off like I'm a smart guy"  Also Dylan: "The rat is named Pierre"
As of Italian decent, I seriously thought he was attempting a French accent at the beginning, not Italian. 😂 (Note: my grandpa on my dad’s side was an immigrant from Italy.)
20:20 is the shop "Destruction Des Animaux Nuisibles" in Paris, it still exists today and the showcase is the same as in the movie
Dylan my guy you are great at making me laugh my butt off literally every two seconds of each of your videos I watch
BOY MEETS WORLD PRAISE 🤍
"Sometimes I feel the need to warn people about Moose" Dylan ratting himself out as the credits subtitle writer for Monty Python and the Holy Grail... again.
Ok but as someone who loves this movie so much and knows the whole plot, it was hilarious when he said "Ohhh his name is Alfredo Linguini but his middle name is Jaques... he goes by Jaques though because Alfredo is his father's name and he hates him"... that made me laugh SO HARD, especially when the reveal at the end is that his real father's first name is Jaques.
Dylan: Too much violence in this movie. Dylan a few videos ago: It'd be better if it has more death in it.
12:19  1. Uploading on time (sarcasm) 2. Transitioning into the sponsor (actually amazing) 3. Nose piercing. 4. Fake college.
his lights are in the italian flag this whole time for this french movie i love it
Why did I think you already did a video on ratatouille
There's just something about Dylan loving BMW that makes me love him even more, I knew he reminded me of someone
One of my favorite childhood movies. Love seeing Dylan genuinely enjoy a film !
Eyy, the closest video to Monday 😁After seeing his reaction to aggressive characteristics and villains I think Dylan needs BetterHelp to sponsor him 😅
Dylan getting tired of violence?!!? He's changing y'all
Oh please do not even think about her and pierre the rat— We dont want another bee movie remake
*Dylan thinking his name is pierre for 30 minutes straight*
Kill the mouse???? I'd just put it outside 💀
I watched that movie in cinemas when I was 6 with the family of a friend. I was so scared and started to cry so we had to leave in the middle.... I just realized that I never saw the ending till i clicked on this video.
At this point, I’m pretty sure Dylan chooses his movies based on how well he can transition it into an ad for Audible
If he says Jacques ONE MORE TIME." Dylan :"Jacques "
I love that now dylan just gives us a look like 'yes, I've got weird kinks but you already know that so stop looking at me like that' and doesn't have to utter even a single word anymore and we know exactly what he means!
I love it when Dylan really enjoys a movie.
25:36 took me OUT
the dead rat place still exists in paris just saying
Dylan, if you like Shotgun Granny you'll LOVE my great grandma! Hmu, for her number 👩‍🦳❤
We watched this in my French class bc we were gonna make Ratatouille and can I just say Skinner is absolutely terrifying when he’s yelling in French! I don’t remember much from that class but that I do!
As a French woman, i can confirm that shooting our boyfriends with a gun is indeed a huge turn on for us.
From italy to france with the accents 😭😭😭
I laughed so hard throughout this entire review 😭 such a quality video
I can't even tell you how fucking HAPPY dylan's videos make me. You make my day.
“saved by the bell inferior to boy meets world “ YUP!!!! also dylan can u review an episode of dawsons creek and one tree hill and compare them?? rlly need that
What do you mean KILL THE MOUSE??? Who kills mice they don’t do shit just catch them and get them out 😭😢
dylan's ability to come up with a random name for characters who already have names and run with it for the entire video 😭
“OMG, he’s me.” That level of realization made this reaction that much more superior.😂
So. First of all, this is NOT a Disney movie. There is no clear negative towards Walt Pictures, but this is generally not their level and type of work, it never was and is unlikely to ever be. Pixar did it. Secondly, that's the point. Rat in the kitchen. As in other films, the non-flying animals eventually fly, the dogs play basketball, and the women take off their men's wigs and play football. You've seen movies like this before, stop it.
The only thing I can think of while Dylan doing French accents was “MaLIfAhSaNt” cause he kept dogging the actor for saying Maleficent the way you’re suppose to say croissant 😂
The perfect movie
Dylan posting just hours before my birthday is the best birthday gift <3 I love you Dylan
I have 5 pet rats I love to walk around with them on me and they run around my house often even in the kitchen 😂 watching non rat people react to rats is so surreal to me
Dylan watching a horror movie :" okay not scary what about MOOSE "
your name concerns me
“Toodles! … Turtles?”
8:27 That’s the whole point! “Anyone can cook!” It thematically makes more sense than a dog or some other random animal
i'm not making a recommendation-- i'd never do that to you, dylan-- but i am saying that the movie ratatoing would ruin your fucking day in perhaps the best way possible.
Yes Dylan I am obsessed with the film and I’ve still killed the mice I’ve found at my house
Ratatouille is an absoloute masterpiece.
I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS❤️❤️
I have never seen this movie and now I'm traumatized. HOW WAS THIS RATED G?!
YOU SHOULD WATCH INTO THE WOODS
fun fact for dylan: the plural of moose is meese. like goose and geese. enjoy your meese, dylan.
I'm actually kind of shocked that the nose ring was present since the start of the video
Dylan. Disney’s TITULAR mascot is a MOUSE!!! How did you not know how this got approved 😂😂😂😂!!     (I’m laughing in good fun; I love Dylan. Don’t come for me)
Dylan, are you doing something different w your facial hair? Doesn’t look bad 💗
*sniff* “no poison 🤭”
As a french person, this is all one hundred percent legit
Dylan when there's no violence in animated kid's movies: 😡😡😡 Dylan watching Ratatouille and surprised by the violence: *shocked Pikachu face*
"a rat's throw of pepper" I'M SCREAMINGGG can we start measuring things in rat throws from now on please
Yesssss we love boy meets world in this household 😂❤️
nice beard
Lmaoo it was fleas on rats that caused the plague 🤣 good try though dylan
4:00 Why are you shocked by the shotgun until you consider the dangers of moose - right after you remember that she is living in France? Where there are no moose?
Dylan: "he's just a goofball with no talent" Audience: *pauses* Dylan: *pauses* Dylan: He's me!! Audience: 😂🤣
As a Frenchie, I can confirm we are wild. The movie does not even do us justice 🤷🏻‍♀️
right off the bat, using an italian accent instead of french. It’s gonna be a good video.
I've actually eaten cheddar cheese and strawberries at the same time the way Remy did. Food of kings
Dylan: why Disney  so aggressive  Also Dylan every 2 minutes: kill him! Kill him! 😂😂😂
A cozy sunday evening with good food and Dylan's video is easily the best days of my life.
17:00 - Dylan 😂😂 love that this is where your mind immediately went 😏😋
Wait…it’s Sunday..no? or else I’m fired
I missed you
It's meese Dylan, meese Foot, feet, shoop, sheep, moose, meese
People didn't find out that Remi had been cooking at Gusteau's; the health inspector just reported a rat infestation, so the restaurant was shut down. Igor lost his credibility because he had said it was so good and then the rat infestation news hit.
Im ngl Dylan rats are gross but like the same way any other animal is😭 they carry diseases prob bc of where they live/touch (and the lack of rabbies shots and such). But they do satanize them good enough i guess bc we see them whole body wise😭
I love how he just basted flabbergasted without even noticing
Dylan dissing on Linguini’s appartement as if those aren’t any standard Parisian appartement 😂 and honestly with this view and the spa for a full fridge, he’s paying good money for that apartment too
I have pet rats (:
Asking the French out there, is there a reason someone would need a shotgun in the French countryside?
"has a hair pulling kink" but whyy did he make me see it this way T_T
Oh my goodness how HAPPY I was to see this my favourite movie + my favourite YouTuber 🧑‍🍳🤌
Dylan is so consistent that he couldn't even wait till Monday for a movie commentary monday, he posted on a Sunday
Dylan is in trouble 🤝 Mike's Mic                           Ratatouille
I know nothing about moose Dylan, please educate us
Am I crazy or was there a scene where Pierre ist shown to also be cleaner then other rats? 🤔
You should watch the movie Flipped
"Difficult" doesn't even cover that recipe, pal:  Fish wrapped in seaweed and salt, cuttlefish tentacles, dog Rose puree (floral jam, if my research is right.), geoduck (clam that looks like a big penis is sticking out of it) egg, dried white fungus, anchovy licorice sauce (most likely fake before this movie came out.)
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS thank you Dylan 😭🫶🏽
Your videos literally make my day. I get so happy when you upload ❤️
*Me every time, when Dylan posts a video, I got sadder and sadder that he doesn’t have patreon where I could watch the whole movies with him 😂
Dylan saying he doesn’t want violence is like saying he went to a successful college
22:02 probably the most violent attack Dylan has experienced throughout the whole movie
scornful? 😂
I live in Alaska so I see moose a lot and let me tell you, they’re huge. They usually won’t mess with you, but a mom and baby lived in my yard for 2 months and I got to see the mom growl and stomp. It was majestic and terrifying.
You changing the names confused the shit out of me 😂
I’m always looking forward to your Monday videos, best way to start the week ❤
I’m pretty sure the “bet your wondering how I got here” comes from the Ferris Bueler movie
Dylan  omg why is she shooting at them also dylan shoot himm!!
What moose hurt you, Dylan?
I love rats XD and it's not the rats that carry disease... it's the fleas that can normally come with rats. ^.^ rats didn't cause the plague... they were just the vessel for the bugs that caused the plague... rats are "relatively" clean... XD but mouths are dirty, all mouths, you don't want teeth of any creature to penetrate skin.
The amount of times Dylan bursts out laughing during this video is my reason to live
Fun fact, that shop with all the dead rats is still in Paris to this day
This movie will forever be my comfort movie 😭
This used to be one of my childhood favorites 😭 Good times...
no, i would NOT kill a mouse in my home?????????? humane traps are a thing plus i've had pet rats, they're wonderful, i could never do that it's cruel
What is Dylan’s beef with mooses what trauma does he have???😂😂
Brad Bird is the goat of Pixar, too bad he only made two movies with them (The Incredibles & Ratatouille). Hopefully he directs another Pixar film in the future.
Dylan please react to Parasite ! You will love it for sure 💗
I was missing your videos ❤
Dude... Mooses freak me out too
at this point i'm just watching Dylan's videos for his amazingly smooth transitions into the audible sponsorship
Fun fact rats are actually very clean animals compared to most and get a bad rap! They groom just as much/more than cats do, as well as constantly groom each other. Not saying they're clean enough to let into your restaurant, but not the dirtiest wild animal that can be let into a kitchen. 🤣 (Also, ratmom here, they are amazing pets - basically pocket dogs - and my boys can do tricks and are litter trained. ☺️)
This guy kinda looks like the main character from Ratatouille
the day he watches the maze runner i will die happy
I’m convinced this guy has a knife kink🤣
Rackfocus? More like ratfocus. Am I right?
Dylan being confused as to why colette liked jacque,  Girls like goofballs Dylan,that's why u have a bigger proportion of girls in ur fanbase
Funnily enough the scene that you started analyzing in the beginning I had to analyze  in my film class
Actually, that window with dead rat bodies really does exist in Paris, to this day yes, you can search it up.
There is not one moose in the entire country of France
This movie traumatized me as kid.  So my parents and I went into the cinema for this. I was about 5 years old and it was my first time in a cinema… Not even 30min after it began I was terrified bc of those loud as sounds and the shooting, everything.  My dad went to the bar at this place with me while my mom enjoyed the rest of the movie HAHAHAHAHHA
You Have The Best Sponsor Reads and Transitions.
This movie amused me when it first came out but... I've had a rat infestation problem in my garage and in my chicken coop for 12 years now and I am honestly over it. I can no longer watch this movie and enjoy it because rats are disgusting. Dylan reacting to it is just gold though lmfao
I need Dylan to watch Fleabag
Pitch perfect or cheetah girls?
dylan understanding why he’s single through a children’s movie is the best thing i’ve ever witnessed
Such a good film
12:14 "I'm not a big history guy, not a big math- and science guy either. And literature I do struggle with" Dylan forgot to mention the most important one: He's not a botanist either.
You need to react to Everything Everywhere all at Once ~
'A 🐀  fist of some pepper' 😅🤣😂
Dylan talking abt mooses reminded me of the hush comentary
Well well well….look who it is.. Dylan with the monthly uploads
I love how Dylan is so supremely confident about every prediction he makes even if he is way off the mark. I strive to reach that level of confidence
you somehow choose the best movies to react to what a guy
Dylan always has perfect timing I just sat down to eat lunch
Dylan you should watch RIO
Animal carcasses hanging in the window? Chinatown all day
I saw a reel the other day, the rat trap shop (20: 10) is a real store in Paris and it actually has rats in the window like that
for the amount of times dylan wanted death and murder to happen in a movie he seemed so shocked by the old lady
1000% Saved by the Bell is inferior to Boy Meets World
20:58 Dylan calling them Jacq and Pierre instead of Remy and Linguini makes this whole movie sound like a french 90's tv drama or something
I fucking love this movie. And as someone who had a pet rat (not as a consequence of this movie) I would also be more concerned about hygiene than the cooking process
Dylan’s upload schedule is just like my mental health
You know watching you for long and all those times you are sour patch kids made me wanna buy some because when you're eating it and Washing it down with water I to wash down my candy with water but I've cold water and mango juice slushified watching you eat it is satisfying and it looks delicious. I won't get the regular pack I will get the tropical one because those have better flavors . I don't like lemon lime orange flavored candy. Like instead of yellow being lemon 🍋 it should be pineapple 🍍 Instead of orange being orange 🍊 it should be peach 🍑 or Mango 🥭 Instead of green being lime or watermelon 🍉 the green one should always be green apple 🍏 Like candy brands really have something against green being green apple flavored. Red should always be strawberry 🍓 Blue should always be blueberry 🫐 Pink should always be raspberry
Your reaction on the « dead rats shop » was hilarious to me knowing the fact that it’s a very famously real shop in Paris 😂
I am always entertained at Dylan vs Disney+ but earlier today I was having a similar battle and now all I feel is empathy 😢
Dylan in this review: why is this movie so violent? Dylan in every other review: death violence death
“If I don’t love it, I don’t swallow” I feel like I’ve watched a similar movie with that line in it before.
3:54 Dylan felt every emotion imaginable in the span of like, ten seconds
I cannot blame Dylan for calling the Rat 'Pierre', they barely call him as Remy in the movie, I didn't know for years and this is one of my favorite movies lol
There was a scene where they went roller-skating 🤣 He was good, she wasn't.
Animated movie about a mob? Do you mean shark tale?
God loves you 💞
25:35  The silence made it even funnier
Dylan: I’ve seen this before  Dylan 20 seconds later: the mafia is in this right?
I love how Dylan renames every character 😂 I will forever think of them as these names now.
I just Love this... 9:10
dylan's beard??? in the ad??? looks really good???
Love the Moose in France haha
@5:20 i see Dylan’s love of gilfs continue
Lol those hanging rats in the window are real
Am I the only one who thinks that way or why does Dylan look so sexy with that beard ............
Dylan: there is too much violence. Also Dylan: SHOOT HIM!
my comfort youtuber talking abt my comfort movie, thank you dylan <3
is that a new sweatshirt???  *gasp*
I can't lie, I find myself looking forward to how Dylan transitions to the Audible ad read every single video 🤣🤣🤣
19:49 "k!l your dad" thanks dylan i needed this so much rn. tysm/j 25:35 took me a second almost missed it lmaooo
I was so confused on to why I had never seen this video and then I realized it was just posted😭😭
31:56 She likes him because he not only listens to her advice but he implements her advice too, he takes her seriously, respects her hard work and expertise. Considering she has had to fight against misogynistic assholes her entire career he is a breath of fresh air. But i'm sure you already knew that and was just playing it up for content and has nothing to do with why you're single right? 😉😂♥
Dylan thinks Linguine is talentless and can't achieve anything on his own, Dylan sees Linguine succeed by being a faux chef, Dylan realizes he is Linguine, Dylan hires rat to write his book.
Dylan! How do I say this... you're not allowed to say "toodles" in a different way. Don't you know I say it with you at the end of the video?
i love this movie
Who agrees that Dylan has to watch Rise of the guardians?
Dead rats in the windows is actually a thing in Paris, usually taxidermised though (is that a word?). I once heard an exterminator say "well what the fuck else am I supposed to put in the window?"
Fun Fact : The shop with the rats is a real place in Paris
BTW The store with the dead hanging rats is actually a real life store. It’s a rat trap store in Paris and their display is exactly how they show it in the movie 😆
Happy Monday everyone! 🙌
“Turtles?” Lol! … also I love that Dylan knows The Wonder Years ❤
i'm part of your french demographic so thank you for reviewing this movie! it is very beloved here :)
It’s always amazing when daddy Dylan uploads!!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉  Edit: Dylan being turned on by Collett is hilarious. I love this channel.
The accents...chefs kiss
I can't be the only one who is disappointed by Dylan not picking up on the little downward glance Collette does when Linguini says he has a "very little" 🙈 he made the joke, but didn't notice that Pixar made it too 😂😂
Dylannnnnn do a first and last of Brooklyn 99!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The fact that the store with the dead rats in the window really exists in Paris 😂😂
"What a weird guy. I would never be turned on by something so weird" - Dylan while watching Ratatouille...    And then there's Dylan while watching Zootopia
Thank you for posting Dylan. I live in Iran and am surrounded by bad news  Your videos keep me sane 💛
not Dylan being attracted to the old lady
yYYEEEEESSSSSSS
its rated lower bc its an older movie, also its pixar kek
You edited out the rat and patootie part?! That is a crime a punishable crime! 😅
Boy Meets World IS a classic show! Underrated as hell
Pleaseee react to Boy Meets World!! I love that show <333
Ratatouille is a masterpiece and nobody can convince me otherwise. It's suitable for children (yes, there's loads of violence in it, but stuff like that often flies over children's heads) and also features some pretty dark themes that cater to more adult audiences. All around a solid family film and I love re-watching it now and again.
Danny
Dylan every other movie “where’s the death!?!?!?!?” Sees a shot gun “noooooo”
Ratatouille is one of my favorite movies, i watch it usually at least once (sometimes twice) a month, it's a big comfort movie for me, i love it so much😭
the silence at 25:35 had me howling sdsdfdd
Do princess and the frog !!
Dylan, since you love connecting with your audience so much with your real nose ring and such you should start every video in a new accent/language
25:36 your face was epic. Too funny 🤨🤣
I don't think they all found out that the rats do the cooking I think Ego just lost his job because he gave a good review to a restaurant that had a rat infestation. Only a few people knew that the Remy cooked the food. Also we all like you cause you're a goofball.
I am very in love with dylan idk
i would never kill a mouse/rat unless my house was infested and there was no other way to get them out
I actually needed to be cheered up today, thank you
12:19 same Dylan same 🙃
AYEEE look at Dylan finally growing some facial hair 😂👏 still can't connect tho 😂      Lol jkjk love ya Dylan 😘
ahhhh!!!! Thank you so much for reviewing this!!!! I got a mini heart attack when i saw this
Dylan: “oh She’s probably an American. No it’s France” it’s funny how nowadays we just assume someone to be American if they own a gun. Go gun violence.
And yes, there was a minor growth in families adopting rats following this movie. Btw rats make very good pets, they're very affectionate and good with kids, they're smart and can be taught tricks.
I love how i've slowly started predicting when the ad is gonna show up while watching the vids
yes i love this movie yes i would still scream and kill a rat the very second i saw it
DYLANNNN I MISSED YOU
PIERREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE GASLLLLLLLLYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Uhhh guys its sunday we got this shit a whole 1 day early
The irony in you naming Colette Christina. It took me back. Because my name is Christina and when I took french my french name was Colette. Lol😂
Watching Dylan slowly come to terms with genuinely enjoying and being in to the film.  "he's just a goofball with no talent!  Oh God he's me..."  This is a momentous day
6:02 this is one of my favorite Disney movies and I've literally had two pet rats and several pet mice lmao
See if you can find Your Friend, the Rat ...it's an extra made for this movie, with Remy and Emille.  I have a feeling you'd enjoy it 🤣
Dylan sir, you missed a GREAT editing opportunity! @32:00 when you say that Colette has a lot of great qualities, flash in with all the smack, knives, and yelling. Would have been amazing! I love your work tho, so carry on
she likes him because he doesn't run over her opinions and from her first big speech with the knives, we know she usually has to have guard up and be super defensive. he is super not threatening and that's why
i used to watch this movie every night on my ipod nano as a child
dylan changing the names of the characters in every movie is the best thing ever
the fleas on the rats started the plague dylan
6:15 As a person whose favorite movie is ratatouille, yes, I do "kill" mouse if they are in my house (mostly my cats do). That is, until one day I'm cooking and one of them appears and adds like parsley to my soup or sum. That's when I'll keep that rabid thing as a pet.
there bare just so many great one liners through out this. i can't. "disney who did you bribe" "this is a freaking horror movie"
Dylan repeatedly calling Remy “Pierre” is the sequel to Travis the monkey from Aladdin 😂
Ima kill a mouse, rat , roach, and a spider.  BEST REACTION EVER!!!
AHH the video hasn't started BUT IM SO EXCITED. THANK U DYLAN
I love watching Dylan just having the most unexpected crushes on the characters
Dylan:” this movie is so violent” Also Dylan: *constantly wishing for death*
This is one of my favorite Disney movies and animations me and my mom would watch it quite a bit and there been times she watch it by herself Dylan has been my favorite reaction to this movie
Missed the part where Dylan renamed the rat Pierre and i was confused all video wondering who Pierre was💀
can always count on you and your consistent videos and your humor to save the day. i genuinly appreciate it a lot
Oh Dylan, you're so fine yet so dumb but that's why we love you
When I started this video, I thought we'd be seeing more of Dylan simping over animated animals, but no. Not 5 minutes in and he's got it bad for the crazy lady with the umbrella gun.
I knew the "if I don't love it I don't swallow" line was gonna be featured lmao
Every time I'm delighted to discover that Dylan has set up and executed another perfect segue to the ad.
the lights in the back forming the Italy flag 😭
As a Canadian, I can say, don’t trust the moose….
Dylan: there's enough violence in the world I don't want it in my movies. Also Dylan: when the hell is someone going to die a gory death in this film? I'm 3 minutes in for sobbing out loud!
Also sad that Dylan didn’t catch that when linguini was saying I have this tiny, this little … she actually glances down lmao
Fun fact : the shop that sells rat poison with dead rat in display is actually a real one in Paris that still as the same shop windows ! Really disturbing to see it everyday lol
dylan likes boy meets world my life is complete
Omg I made the mistake of choosing watch this movie while I was high one night completely forgetting that I'm still dealing with pest control for the rats in my own attic and to say I FLIPPED THE FUCK OUT when I heard them moving around up there the same time the scene where the ceiling fell down is a massive understatement. Could not sleep right for WEEKS
Im waiting for your Christmas movies🤭
Movie commentary Monday's are Sunday evening commentaries here in zimbabwe
Love Dylan watching old films🤧this movie came outwhen I was 7 now I'm 22.
React Monday on a Sunday  A French movie Dylan doing an Italian accent It can’t get more perfect than this
This is literally my dad's favorite movie. He took this stuff to heart
I love this movie so much and the dish ratatouille is my favourite frensh dish of all time, I remember when I asked  my mom to make it for the first time and it left some found memories in my childhood.
6:04 I’d kill the mouse as soon as my eyes laid on it- cute movie but a rat is a rat 😭
on tumblr i read that there is actually a porn where colette falls in love with pierre instead of jaque
32:06 him realising that he's a goof ball too is so funny 🤣
YES YES YES you read my mind ive wanted you to do ratatouille since i discovered your channel !
If I saw a rat in my house I'm leave the house. ATP the rats and the mice own the house 😂😂😂
Those are bay leaves which have a lot more flavor than basil leaves, you take them out before you serve because they don’t taste good
I love dylan's issues he has issues with a love😂🤣🥰😂🤣
another goated vid although i almost unsubscribed cause of that Saved by the Bell comment.  yeah Boy meets World is awesome but Saved by the Bell was stellar as well.  Zack was the homie
Love this movie, love Dylan.   Perfect combo
love dylan
One thing I like about Dylan’s channel is that I’ll never know when will he post or what movie he’s gonna watch. It’s like a surprise yk😂
I miss Dylan's reactions!
the italian accent ??? 😭😭
The two seconds pause that turns absolutely everything dirty... i need those in my daily life!
I legit saw ratatouille on disney plus 10 minutes ago and thought "has dylan watched this with us?" perfecto
dude stop the rat blasphemy, ticks caused the plague
this is my dads favorite disney movie cause he's also a chef and loves this movie and its our comfort movie <3
Fleas caused the plague not rats! Ratties are awesome and super smart ❤
That food critic reminds me of my high school teacher mr holland.. so terrifying.. until I was 16 then I ended up having sex with him in his office for the last year.. 😂😂😂
38 day free trail to life
I'm French and i didn't know that was how americans perceived our accents but thats really funny
watch boy meets world!!!
Me and my younger brothers love this movie so much.
ahhh we love a new video every monday.
youtube showing me a dettol ad while dylan talks about hygiene is so ironic
You didn’t remark on the “one can get too familiar with vegetables” line. And you didn’t say anything about the fact that she glances down at his ding dong when he says that he has a “tiny little…”
Dylan absolutely forgetting the scene where she taught him how to rollerskate left me speechless
as a kid I thought Luiguini's flat was horrible and way too tiny. Now, as a Parisian student with less than 10m2, I envy him so.much. The guy has toilets in his flat for god's sake ! that's luxury !
The Italians🤝The French  Their anger toward Dylan
as a Norwegian was that French accent very authentic
The "who gave this woman a gun" line literally killed me 💀
20:58 he should watch the bee movie…
As someone who lived in Paris for many years, I can assure you rats in restaurants is a much more common experience than you’d expect
dylan you look so good and you’re so talented and funny wow I love you
Why is it everytime i think to myself “do u think dylen ha any new videos?” There it is 😃 its not even Monday yet!
I understood the end like they closed the restaurant simply because there were rats. Not knowing that the rats were cooks. And that remains as a secret known only to Ego, Linguini and Collette.
me and my rats looking at each other when dylan says ' i just wanna make this movie didn't give ppl an affinity for mice and rats ' like i didn't name them remy and emile bc of the movie
6:05 I am not killing mice. Rats? Hell yeah, they are way bigger and can be actually dangerous, but mice? Please, they are actually kinda cute. They just eat what they can find. Honestly, if not for them shitting all over the place, I wouldn't mind having mice in my house. I'm catching mice instead. I have this trap that allows them to get in but won't let them out. That way I don't have to be a MURDERER and I can safely let them go somewhere else.
Now Dylan I would never make a recommendation in the comments cuz I know u hate them. But I can say that I’m sure I can speak for a lot of people when I say your audience would like to see you watch Kung Fu Panda 2 and all the Toy Story movies
I love how i continues to name Remy ‘Pierre’ haha
As a Canadian. I agree with the Moose point. They scary asf
The villain in this movie really is the villain bc he doesn’t want his food to be cooked by rats???
i loved the movie so i bought a small rat 😅
btw the shop with the dead rats exists in Paris 😭
Broski i literally watched ratatouille yesterday do u live in my closet🤨
The plague started like covid.. from contaminated food, or the transfer of bodily fluids.. delicious 😂😂
Dylan is so adorable to movie.  And this is one of my favorite animated movies ever!
That was funny. I've seen the movie before and forgot most of it. I didn't realize that there was violence in it. Funny as always, Dylan.
It never crossed my mind that Dylan would ever watch this lol  I was watching someone talk about this like two days ago and now Dylan’s doing it👌🏽
Dylan is the only guy on YT where I watch and never skip the sponsor part of his videos. Love it!  Edit: I think it's alright to mention I love Daniel Thrasher's skits, too.
when that guy says popular his eyes went crazy
8:24 that's literally my reaction when I rewatched the movie a few days ago
People are crazy for eating fast food made by other people lol
I admire Dylan’s consistency of posting every Monday. What a mature quality for a 20 year old.
Dylan i beg you to watch some "debunking rat myths" videos 😭
💜
The setup 12:13 The plot twist 32:05
'What am I good at?'  Audible transitions, my man.  And being twenty for sure
dylan you're killing me
For someone who asks for death in a lot of movies,Dylan. You surprised me with this one😅
Has Dylan ever watched Ghibli movies?? Seeing his reaction to creative camera movements on animation, he would probably loose his mind on Spirited Away :))
Please watch rango
Dylan...Skinner doesn't have social anxiety. He didn't want the soup to be sent out and froze once he passed the kitchen doors because he realized it would look bad for the restaurant if he stopped the soup from going out. It would freak the rest of the customers out.
I was having a mental breakdown and then I saw that Dylan uploaded a new video. Now I feel better, thank you
Dylan making the french flag with the lights and his white shirt - this guy thinks of everything!!🇫🇷
Everyone: the rats name is not ratatouille it is remy! Dylan: pierre! 🤌🏼
HIS NAME IS REMY!!! YOU FAKE FANS!!!
dylans humor is just superior, gets me everytime i swear
baysil leevs
Jaque and pierre💀
Turtles
I love when Dylan gives his insight on the movie shots, camera movements and other technicalities.
I really do like that they added the detail of the rats going through the sanitization machine, it's a little detail they probably didn't need to do, but man, is the rat cleanliness such a relief 🤣
Love watching Dylan enjoying a movie, so fun and heartwarming!
My favorite Pixar movie
Be reassured by the thought this was made pre pandemic
Yknow it's true about Moose. In Canada it's an important thing to know that if you're choosing between a Moose and....anything else  Dont choose the moose
Thing I always remember is when I watched that around age 11 or so, my friend that I watched it with wanted to have a rat afterwards.
stop bullying the rats dylan ;_;
I currently have COVID and this is the only thing keeping me alive.
I love that Dylan is reacting to our childhood movies and posting them every single Monday
dylan the only youtuber who's sponsor transitions are smoother than butter
Have you watched fired up if you haven't I would highly recommend
As a canadian, moose are EXACTLY what i think they are😂😂 MASSIVE mother fuckers they are
12:18, Dylan you're good at looking at the small details in fims, like the camera change as a conversation goes on, and the blur on the house.
mi a zis mama sa ma duc pan la baie repejor pentru ca mi a luat dalin cel mai bun si cel mai fin si mi a zis deschide ochii nu te ustura deloc cu dalin eu i am deschis nu ma ustura v am zis
I knew from the start Dylan would have a thing for Colette and honestly, can't blame him 😂😂
As a Canadian, that fact about moose is 100% true. They're fucking tanks with gore machines sticking out the sides of their head.
bit of a fun fact but the only reason rats got out of control n came with the plague, is literally the fault of white men burning ’witches’ at the stake. witches were in tune with nature and esp cats, cats loved to hunt rats, so when all these women were burnt their cats were either abandoned or trapped, and thus rats grew rampant
fun fact, skinner is named after a psychologist who used to test on rats by locking them in box’s. that’s why the chef is named after him
Fun fact. That rat shop ACTUALLY exists in France, the rats are stuffed from like the 1600s but are in the window like that!
my first thought when i saw the notification for this video was, "damn, has dylan watched ANY movies on his own time?" until he said that he's seen it already lol
Everyone’s posting right now and I love it
Dylan in pretty much all previous movies: "It's so boring, no one dies in this movie" Dylan watching Ratatouille: "WHY IS THIS MOVIE SO VIOLENT?"
neat vid
she likes him cuz hes a nice idiot, sad to say smart girls like himbos
(not so) Fun fact:  this shop with the dead rats is, in fact, a real place in Paris, and it's about as horrifying as you think it is
ah my boring Sunday night is saved
To answer your question, I would absolutely not kill a mouse in my house. I'd catch and release it. I love rats, not because of this movie, but they're great pets.
Dylan take it from someone who has worked with moose. You are spot on. They move very quickly without appearing to be in any rush 😬. They can kick all 4 legs in all 4 directions. 😳 And it be high enough to kick a grown man in the face (insert Kevin Hart joke here)
ngl with your italian accent you look like you should have a really thick fancy moustache & i hope you grow one soon for this reason alone
Turtles!
Dylan, I’m starting to think that I have a chance with you because of this trend I’m seeing with these movies and the way you seem to be drawn to violent or in charge women lmao
Just clocked that Dylan is doing the Italian flag with the lights. Love that he is just so wrong.
Thank you for the moose reminder Dylan
Waiting for the day when Dylan watch Megamind. It'll be the best day of my life for real
dylan: why is this movie so VIOLENT? movie studios put too much violence into their movies 😠 also dylan every movie: MURDER!!! WHERE IS THE MURDER??!!!
I've never seen Dylan enjoy a movie SO MUCH, the shock, the awe, the expressions , everything was turned up. I loved every second 🤣🤣🤣
You would think Dylan would be so happy to see a grandma with a shotgun after always complaining that there’s no violence 😭
The whole point is that rats in the kitchen is nasty, so one being a cooking prodigy is against expectation and plays with the dreamers and underdog tropes.  Also, rats didn't cause the Plague. The fleas upon the rats caused the Plague.
The woman has a shotgun because the movie takes place in the '50-'60s, during the cold war. Granny had to protect herself somehow during the german occupation. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Truly love this authentic Italian accent for a movie set in Paris. France. With people who speak French.
Rats get a bad reputation for something that wasn't even their fault!  They didn't cause the plague, they carried a flea that had the plague on it!  There's even a featurette on this movies DVD that talks about it!
“moose, their not what you think they are” -Dylan 2022
Dylan roasting jacques the entire time and then realizing they are similar has me dying rn
it’s the way dylan falls in love with either an elderly woman or villain every movie for me 🤣🤣
pls play the new netflix game too hot to handle😂❤
I've been waaaaiiiiting for this video!
Dylan asking for murder and violance in every movie and when he finally get it he is shocked is giving me life
You know, this movie is more violent than I remember... The food is what blurred my memories of it.
I bought pet rats after seeing this film. They make the best pets--i had multiple pairs of  them for about ten years. Its so sad they only live about 3 years.
FINALLY OH MY GOD
me: dylan isn’t that controversial…. dylan: saved by the bell sucked me: cancelled
DYLAAAN WE MISSED YOUUUU
dylan missed the "i have a tiny... A little..." joke 🤣
NEW DYLAN VIDEO LESGOOOOO
I literally gasped when i saw dylan had a new video… do i need help
When Ego was a critic, he was rail thin because "if i dont love it, i dont swallow" but at the end, you can see his stomach is more round, to show he's actually started eating more.
20:00
There's actually a deleted scene where Gusteau is not only alive, but they explain that the frozen foods line is because of how dire their situation actually is, to get at least some money going into the restaurant.
The title dish is one that was made popular by chef Thomas Keller, who was the chef consultant on this movie.  All the cooking advice you hear in the movie is real advice.   Thomas Keller was the guy that asked what the chef had was new.
I actually once wrote a Venom crossover with this movie.  It's called Hasenpfeffer, under ICanSingNoRequiem. Come give it a read!
Note how he stops himself from spitting out the wine, checks the vintage, then swallows it instead.  Man knows better than to waste good wine.
In the end credits, they put a sticker that brags about how they used 100% genuine animation instead of motion capture.  This was a response to the fact that the previous year, they lost the best animated Oscar to Happy Feet.
Dylan: " If you see a mouse in your house, you're killing it, right?"  Well... 😂 Not really. You see I grew up in a family obsessed with animals. So naturaly I am obsessed with them too. ( Except for spiders, I hate those :/ :D ) Anyway me and my family are those type of people who prefer animals over humans... And right now we do have 5 cats, 2 dogs, 3 guineapigs, 2 rabbits and 4 chickens. And I was just telling my mom the other day that I do have a mouse that lives in my bathroom. And I didn't really think about getting rid of her but what my mom responded was another level :D she simply and very seriously asked " And are you feeding her?" 😂 And like I am not about to kill the mouse but I never consider to feed her either. That's a  little too crazy even for me. :D ...
25:35 I CACKLEDDDDDDD
movie commentary sunday??👀
There's a very impressive theory that the old lady in the beginning is Ego mother, and also that Gusteau is Ego's brother!  This is evidenced by the fact that she's wearing the same thing in Ego's flashback when she made ratatouille, and if you look, there is what appears to be a portrait of Gusteau hanging in the background.  The theory is essentially: Ego's always been hard on Gusteau because he felt like Gusteau sold out, and thus dedicated his own life to preserving their mothers teachings and recipes.  The dish that cost Gusteau one of his stars was the ratatouille dish, because it was a far cry from the one they ate when they grew up with.  This also perfectly sets up the ending, because its not just the realization that it's delicious, it's the realization of, "They did it. They finally perfected our mothers recipe!"
There’s nothing I enjoy more than the Italian movie of Ratatouille, with Jacque, Pierre, Chester, Christina and the mob
the audible introduction always gets me lmfao
-"You don't have the GUTS!"   -*Random add* "hi I'm Ryan reynolds"
the NEW YORK italian accent is killing me bc they’re french.
Your production quality is pretty good, considering you're only 20 years old.
That sponsor segue was wayyy too smooth
That rat shop is real. It’s a exterminator.
So close Dylan if only you released this tomorrow it would actually be movie commentary monday lol
29:26 yo that's sanitary, man
It’s the way I needed a mental health break from studying so went to check if Dylan uploaded and HE DID. LESGOOOO
15:30 I absolutely wholeheartedly understand that reaction.
not the rat slander 🥲
The fact that in every movie he changes all the character names, but they fit so I always know who he’s talking about.
I already know I'll rewatch this video, probably as much as the tangled one😂😂😂 I love when a movie surprises him by being interesting
My favorite comedian uploadeddddd woooooo   This is the highlight of my week
Movies rated G for Guns
Its french bro😂
As a French girl I can confirm : all women point there man with a gun when coming back from work, and then we kiss him
Dylan there's no mouse in France T-T
No Dylan, there is no gun and slapping in french culture. We complain and yell in the streets.
My french ass bracing for this video
Who is Dylan? Is he okay?
I love Dylan appreciating this masterpiece
I'm here for the moose PSA 😂
Dylan always improves my Monday!
wow look at this cool hip 20 year old with a nose piercing, and he’s so consistent with his upload schedule! makes me love mondays 🥰
Please. Please. Please. Please, Dylan!!! Play The Quarry. It's from those who made Until Dawn and it has the same vibe. I need to see you play that game. Pleeeeaaassseeee.
not the sound effects in the groin talk again—
Can't get over how Dylan gets calm when he thinks the old woman with a gun is american and then gets shocked when he remembers it's set in France. XD
One of my favorite videos you’ve done❤️
Question of the day, does Dylan know that they made a ratatouille ride at one of the Disney parks!?!??!??? WHERE YOU CAN BECOME A RAT YOURSELF!!!!
you better love this
I need dylan to watch Game of Thrones 💀💀😭
Please Dylan, never try to shoot a moose with a shotgun 😭😂 If you're close enough to kill it with a shotgun, it is close enough to kick you into your next life.
Linguini is attractive because he IS a doofy idiot- he puts himself out there and tries.   So many men stay in their comfort zones, never try anything new, and are not willing to be the “weak” or least talented in the room.
it's the nose. she likes him bc big noses are cool
i cant even get mad at the audible ads they're delivered too well
DYLAN ilysm ratatouille is my favorite movie of all time
Someone, please do how many times Dylan said "Pierre"
star wars
His brother's name is AMEAL LIKE A MEAL 🫨
Thank you dylan,  today is my birthday and I love rats. I was originally going to have a party but I got sick, so now I need to stay in bed for my birthday. So thank you for the ratatouille.
I am pretty sure Dylan you haven't clearly watched the film, because try to observe the painting at 6:25 min.... Absolutely Hilarious!!!
Not a minute in and he is already triggered. 😅
THIS IS my favorite Disney movie!!! probably for the point that you stated: there’s so much violence😭 LMAO it didn’t become my favorite until I was an adult though, I could watch this movie forever
You know that Remi is a metaphor for immigration, and how brown people are treated lesser then in European countries?
YAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yeah Dylan hates violence in his media 🙄
Dylan: The most consistent man on YouTube! 👏
I think dylan was a little TOO excited when Linguini checked his waistband 🤣.. 11:35
This is the laugh I needed today lmao
loved your ITALIAN accent
What an ad transition 😆
♡♡
It's so obvious why she likes him. He's a sweet chaotic goofball. It's cute!
I genuinely thought for YEARS that the opening of Ratatouille was a fever dream that I thought up
I must say Dylan..you kind of remind me of a moose
There is a horror movie like this, it's called Willard
This movie was my childhood 💙
very unrelated comment but does dylan have a letterboxd account ?????
Every time he posts I panic a little thinking its Monday and missed it
why does no one ever talk about DYLAN'S NICE FACE?
Watching Dylan thinking he's cool for feeling sound effects like he discovered something is so funny. No one inform him about asmr
We only use no-kill traps in my house. Catch em, release em outside somewhere there's no cats around.
I love how Dylan can never just call the characters by their names, but then not only does he make it more complicated by giving everyone new names, he also forgets halfway through the video what he named them. 10/10 content, thank you Dylan.
Mice are cute. Rats are not. That’s quite simple actually, especially if you live in the countryside. I used to live in the countryside and we would see one or two mice every once in a while in winter, and we would give them a bit of cheese. That only became a problem when… well… when they started pooping in cabinets… so then we got a cat. But that is a different story. Anyways! Mice are cute, especially little white ones
A grandma trying to shoot rats with a gun…. A women in paris trying to shoot her man with a gun……… LES SCÉNARISTES ONT FUMÉ UNE BAGUETTE OU QUOI ?
The second that I saw that he was watching Ratatouille I knew Dylan was gonna think Colette is hot
This is the fist time I've heard Ratatouille in English,  absolutely horrendous
Day 696969 of hoping that Dylan will react to Anastasia, the iconic animated movie from 1997 🙏🙏🙏
if theres a mouse/rat in my house imma just trap it live and bring it outside bc i couldnt kill anything... especially a rodent :^)
How do you post so consistently?
One of my favourite Disney movies
One does have to make the critique that Alredo should've taken over the restaurant, but left Skinner in charge since he was good in that position, and heck, Alfredo could've taken the waiter position anyways since he did a good job! Also the romantic relationship does make me cringe since it's so underdeveloped, and this was the first time I've heard someone mention Remy's caution to reveal vs wanting to reveal the secret during the news conference, that never sat right with me and you'd think they'd have that conversation.
HES BACK
Dylan has officially inspired me to buy a nose ring that is totally not fake.
Where did you buy the headphones?
When is star wars comming i have been waiting for months!!!
As a fellow former Wisonconsinite, I agree. Moose are war criminals.
Ratatouille was my favorite movie as a kid and I only realized how terrifying it can be when you said it lol.. I think it might be because rats are almost non-existent where I live.. desert privilege ☝️
9.8K VIEWS IN 18 MINUTES !!!!!!!! troublemakers we've come a long way so proud of our lil goofball dylan
REACT TO RIO IM BEGGING U
33:53 🐢😂
Dylan in every possible movie : MURDER AND DEATH PLS Dylan when actual weapons are involved : too much violence what is this
My mom asked what I was watching and I said Movie commentary Monday, she’ll never think I’m sane again, for calling Sunday, Monday
I never thought of Ratatouille like this... Thanks a lot dylan 😭
The second time I watched this film, it was after a particulary drunk night out and that same night I ordered a custom mug that said "If I don't love it, I don't swallow"
It kinda gross, imagine eating food that eats touched 😐 I also realize he kiling his family because he the only one who can tell rather it poison
This is the perfect video to watch on a Monday, I’m so thankful that you manage to always post on schedule, very impressive
how he transitions into his sponsorships is so entertaining
No love listen, I love rats and mice. Like for real for real. If they're in my house, Imma vibe with em. Cuz they are ADORABLE. Idgaf if they make me sick and I die. Life ain't that hot anyways lmao. But they are so CUTE WITH THE NOSE AND THE EARS AND THE OMGGGG
Great video, Dylan!
Dylan Dylan!! I can't believe you missed it! Too busy making your own dick joke to notice that the movie actually did it too! When he is telling her he has a 'tiny ..little ...' she LOOKS DOWN AT HIS CROTCH!! So she was thinking the same thing! It's at 22:13 of your video but you're actually covering it up fyi
I can asure you that a book can flot, but will eventually sink
how do i get surprised by the add segways EVERY TIME like my neighbours must know whenever i'm watching a dylan is in trouble vid because everytime i realise i go "FUCK YOU DYLAN" like a knee jerk reaction but must say i'm impressed because it isn't easy to get me invested enough in a video to forget about a potential add segway lmao been through years of this, yEARS
YES YES YES
this is a big day for the frenchies
I think that this is one of the best videos that Dylan has published! I actually like it more than the Tangled commentary, which has been the reason I found Dylan’s channel and has been favorite ever since
Huh mondays, amiright?
There’s not a lot you can rely on in life, but these videos being uploaded every SINGLE Monday puts my mind at ease
Dylan: "Who gave this woman a gun!!! 😨 Oh, it's probably America- ... ... ... NO IT'S FRANCE" 🤨😟
Ironically it was not directly the rats who spread the plague; it was the fleas on the rats who were carrying the disease!
Was getting worried about you! Just yesterday I was thinking, "I haven't heard from Dylan or Ooga Booga in a hot minute. I hope he's alive. 💕"  Christmas vlog this year?? 🎄
Dylan and his love for old, violent women...
Wait till I tell ya the shop with the dead rats in the display is a real store in Paris.. Dead rats included
Dylan giving a 101 moose safety class while living in Arizona made me laugh more than it should
Moose are not native to France, Dylan.
22k in 40 minutes ?????? DYLAN?!?!
"who gave this woman a gun?! oh...its probably America.....NO ITS FRANCE!" the way i laughed a this lmao
Yayy new commentary videoo
I have to admit, that audible ad transition was pretty good.
thank you for saving my monday with this upload
I would never kill a mouse or rat! Catch them humanely!
Hey Dylan..I was just suffering from depression on breakup recently. But I just opened YouTube and saw your video. It brought a smile on my face...happy to see your video and just so grateful for them...love your commentaries 🥰
There is no live chat
TSINATII
Dylan turned on by colette's violence is me as a 12 yo when I watched this movie
Mobster is to Ratatouille as published author is to Dylan
Mondays are always great because of Dylans videos.
Pretty sure Dylan thought he was about to watch Flushed Away at the beginning with the Italian mob thing
"female rats are smaller than male rats. Remy is smaller than the other male rats. Remy is a trans-man-rat. His father accepted his son, but drew a line at cooking" this is my favorite ratatouille theory lol
Quoting Schaffrillas "Ratatouille is Pixar's magnum opus"
Ugh. I think I’m in love with you, Dylan
This is exactly what I need tonight thanks Dylan :')
Dylan, don't you dare underestimate the power of basil
Nah, I live trap mice and then release them in a field miles away. I have a notes app on my phone with the names i have them lol 🐁
As always, Dylan posting a great video on a nice monday afternoon :D
Why is this the first movie I’ve seen you genuinely enjoy
22:03. We had the same expression except I was making noises
The happiness this video gave me is of the charts. Ratatouille is honestly my favourite Disney movie and Dylan my favourite YouTuber. ❤
After the week I had, really needed this! Thank youu❤
the fact that ratatouille takes place in france and dylan keeps on making italian jokes is perfect
Waiting for train to busan dylan
I use a shotgun to eliminate spiders as well.
"literature i do struggle with" meanwhile he's writing a book😭
Dayung never made it here when the number of messages were still in the hundreds. Feels different:”)
Once when I was at my fathers house I saw a mouse in the kitchen. My dad and brother did not believe me at first. Why because it was an apartment and we were sitting in the same room. But then he showed up and my dad works with animals and insects and would sell mostly insects to shops/zoo's/etc. On the farm mice/rats would cause trouble and my dad killed the mouse with his bare hand. He hit it so hard it died.  My brother and I were shocked😵😵😵
dylan we cant keep defending you-
i’m surprised he’s watching ratatouille considering how much he loves rats
Dylan always has the best segues into his sponsorship
is dylan becoming the yung gravy of youtube
love you, Dylan, you made me laugh just when I needed to
i love this
Boy meets world > saved by the bell but I feel like wonder years was amazing too. Weird that the main characters of both are brothers in real life
Dylan is right Moose are indeed terrafying. They can grow to be as tall as 9,8 feet (3 meters). Seeing one in your backyard during mating/baby season means you do NOT go outside.
Dylan finally meeting his movie match with this one
Ahh yess.. Jacques and Pierre, the most iconic duo to ever exist🤌
I don't know what's funnier, Dylan wishing really hard for some violence or Dylan being shocked when movie has violence
such a good movie
😂 The little detour we took to the hollow book website. Hilarious
I love Mondays
Okay so by Australian time Dylan actually uploaded on a Monday
love how dylan is doing an italian accent when the movie is set in france
"Worst apartment ever with the best view "...  Paris in one sentence
Dylan getting angry everytime at the pause button is one of the best parts.
Wait... Is it Monday already? Love the mustache and beard btw!
Why does this old lady have a gun?!  Well, I'm assuming since she's seen waring a helmet and a gas mask, chances are she was a little girl during the two world wars. She might have had family who served and fought in those wars.   Just some food for thought
The day he actually posts on a Monday I think I might die from shock
lol im from Maine where we actually have to worry about moose and there are no more moose in france lol
dylan technically said my name.
The only thing I remember from this movie is about the rat is a cook and helps the guy out in the kitchen. Also remember just not liking the movie to begin with. Like a rat in the kitchen making food?!?! No thank you.
Ratatouille is indeed a side dish, it's very good, simple and very common here in France. When done right, all the vegetables melt into the mouth and the onions taste like sugar.
13:30 that was one of the best ones you’ve done, Dylan. You actually got me this time. But aren’t they constantly sponsoring you to HINT that they want you to actually write a book??
i think linguine/pierre’s original apartment looks kinda illegal??   parisian law states that buildings have to be below a certain height, so they don’t ruin the view of the eiffel tower. the view from his window looks WAY higher than the rest of the buildings out the window. who approved that building bro
Love how you did that sponsorship.
Alternative title: PSA Watch Out for the MOOSE
Dylan.. ever since I have found your channel my life has seen nothing but enjoyment…. I love your videos…. I come home everyday and watch… your awesome! Thank you for your channel  and dedication to your work.
I’m surprised the editor cut out Dylan’s reaction to the former careers of the other chefs like the resistance guy and skinner
new dylan video yay
"The French are wild. she just shoot him and now it's like a turn on for him" lol who gon tell him about Nabilla?
omg this guy is so cool! he has a nose ring and everything! as someone who’s young, hip and cool he definitely appeals to me!!
New Dylan video! My day just got a lot better!
Again, you always surprise me with how punctual you are with uploads  👏
Fun fact about Remy gagging after smelling Linguini's soup--rats are physically unable to gag, which means that Linguini's soup was so bad it violated the laws of nature
ok but dylan's right about moose, I have an intense phobia once I saw what they were like to scale. I was not expecting that
Italian accent Dylan  *french movie*
3:55 - 4:05 😂
13:34 i was so mentally prepared for the segway omg. i heard "book" and i freaking called it!!!!
Him renaming Remy as Pierre, had me question so much 😂
I’ll be honest, this segway was pretty good, i wasn’t expecting it and it went so smoothly
“Chill with the food orgy”
thank you, dylan, for posting today, on a monday.
Boy meets world is clearly superior- I knew I liked you Dylan.
Can I just say, you look really handsome 🌚
Dylan baby…there are no moose in France. Love your energy though!
I hate rats this film was and still is trauma also does no one question rats cooking their food I agree with granny in the beginning 💀
is that a shot gun? 😳 oh no its an umbrella 🙂 AHHH    LADY!!!!! 😱
he kept the jacques and pierre bit the whole time, love the dedication lmao
best pixar movie ever. my fave
Dylan calling the old lady sexy is gold
The amount of jump scares you had on this video 😂
...gosh i missed you!
he's been waiting his whole life for his moustache to grow so he could watch this movie
Fun fact the rat shop with hanging rats is real and is in Paris. You can search for it. it has the exact same decor with hanging rats.
mad appreciation for dylan uploading every single monday, he’s the most punctual 20 year old i know 🔥
I liveeee for Dylan’s animated movie commentary
He’s backkkkkkk
FINALLY
We know that you love the violence Dylan
Dylan's reaction to this movie was everything 🤣🤣
Dylan: The only youtuber who has me paying attention to the sponsorship segment.
Dylan in every movie commentary: MORE VIOLENCE!!! Also Dylan when there’s violence: Why is this movie so violent? 😨
Dylan saying he hates violence in movies is like him saying he finished his book.
NEW VIDEO WOOOO
Don't wanna just point this out, but anyone else enjoying Dylan's facial hair journey 👌😂
I thought your beard was your sideburn...😶😅
Dylan posting a video every Monday is the only consistent thing in my life
i haven't seen this movie since it came out, i don't remember there being this many guns
Dylan posting is the highlight of my day🙏
I love when you react to disney movies. Can you react to THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME?! Its my favorite disney movie 😁
"she's prolly in america" jajajajajajaj that one sent me
Just so you guys know... this shop with hanged rats (which are fake ones), really exists in Paris   Btw, loved the video !!!!
As a swede I can say that moose aren't that bad. They just run around on the roads, occasionally gets violent (which, yes okay, that might be terrifying if you're on the reseaving end of I guess) and sometimes gets drunk
LmOooooo this movie matched him
The Italian accent 🤌🏼🤌🏼
I got way too excited when Dylan said Christina
i KNEW he would like Colett
I knew it , I knew that he would be attracted to the claudett
every time I'm spiralling this man comes to the rescue with his nose ring and weird kinks
The incredibles movie will shock you too if you’re shocked by this one
Happy Monday guys...
Dylan naming characters random names will never not be funny
so close to Monday yet so far
Mob boss Dylan is pretty high on my list of Dylans
i dont usually comment but GOD dylan ilysm, i've had a fever all day and you uploading made me feel so much better <333
dam who is this young 20 year old
DYLANNNN
:)
i love how dylan bragged about how much he remembers but then makes like three wrong predictions right after
I live in Alaska and I have moose come up to the house all the time and you ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. I can't even leave for work if there is one in the driveway.
A restaurant run by rats is definitely not SANITARY  (Only ogs will get that reference)
"WHO GAVE THIS WOMAN A GUN— oh wait she's probably in america" Dylan matthews, 2022
fun fact: the show with all the rat corpses is a real place in paris xd
I was literally watching this movie for the first time 2 days ago lol 😂😂😂  great minds think alike
Honestly disney should just remake all of their movies but with dylans plotpoints  Edit: I accidentally pressed edit
YESSSSSS
Dylan doing an Italian accent and the lights being the color of the Italian flag is taking me out lmfaooo
DYLAN! I swear just YESTERDAY I was thinking "man, Dylan should really give ratatouille a watch one of these days"!!! But anyway, the point is, Bee Movie  and Monsters vs Aliens when?
i always talk about how great you make my days but I never ask you if you are doing good? so how you been daddy Dylan? if its possible can you make a video about Wednesday Addams I really want to hear your opinions on it!!
Everytime he segues into a sponsor, I feel like I've walked straight into a trap
I want more info on the moose thing🤔
The mandela effect is realizing that Alfredo has a tiny beard.  When I realized, I never saw him the same way again
i'm french and his accent is killing me lmaoooo
your videos give me serotonin
who lives a like on the video before it started?
I just noticed that man at 6:24 painting a naked woman. I've seen this movie a few times, watched many reactions and this is the first time I've caught it.
I am worried by Dylan's apparent awareness of when I am struggling most mentally and his commitment to always uploading in a timely fashion, albeit scarcely on Mondays.
garbage rat
Ratatouille is my comfort movie and I literally just finished watching it about 30 minutes ago! I’ve been having a real shitty day and to see that you’ve just uploaded this has made it slightly better😊 double the comfort in one day🥰
Oh, I just know this is gonna be good
For a second there I thought it was Sunday,but Dylan reminded me that it must be Monday since he‘s always on schedule -Thank you Dylan!
I literally watched this movie for the first time last week, apparently just in time 😂
I have never realised how unhinged Ratatouille was until Dylan pointed it out… thanks for ruining my childhood
"... What am I good at?"  Not Dylan having an existential crisis in the middle of watching Ratatouille 😭😭😭
We back with the animated movies
6:03 no, I love mice, when I saw one in my house my parents freaked out but I was just surprised and I thought it was cure. We did not kill it.
as a french i'm laughing so much at his french accent lol
I'm early today i clicked thinking it's an old video
I have the flu and have finals next week. Ive been absolutely miserable and cant eat a thing. Thank goodness for a new Dylan video. It will cure me 😻
This movie is way more violent then i remember 😭
I had a wild rat as a pet a little after seeing this movie
DYLAN DID YOU HEAR HYUNA AND DAWN BROKE UP!!!!!??😢😢
the funniest thing about the "soup scene" is that rats don't have gag reflex - so this soup was so disgusting that it broke Remi..
A childhood favorite of mine
It's not a Dylan commentary if Dylan doesn't simp for a grandma lol
I’m stoned and about to eat Let’s do this
Just some food makin rats how yu duh
Ratatouille is rated G for Guns
the second dylan gets his violence hes against it
i killed the mouse but named it Remi
Ratatouille is my favorite movie. I named my dog after Remy lol
finally
the speed with which I clicked on this
They had a game on Xbox 360 that absolutely smashed. I miss it
Love the movie but definitely getting an exterminator.
I was so confued with the Italian accent in the beginning, I was like, wasn't this movie set in france lmao 😭😭
Boy Meets World is iconic
dylan doing an italian accent and referring mobs, but its based in France lol
Dylan's Italian accent, mama mia🤌🏻
183 comments in 7 minutes. Dylan you have a _chokehold_ on us. Anyway you better like this fucking movie
wow I almost forgot today was Monday!!
I love this dylan watching cartoon movies era
I will stop anything and everything to watch Dylan's video I'm so serious
For once Dylan has admitted he's seen the movie before rather than saying he's never watched it and goes on to mysteriously predict everything that happens in the movie
My favorite thing On Monday morning!
Never been this earlyyyyy. TSINATII IM WATCHING RIGHT NOW FIND THIS COMMENT AHUNNNN!!!
I find it cringe how I see youtube comments saying "We appreciate so much how X always uploads and brightens our days hehe uwu" and shit but lowkey feel that way with Dylan even tho he's a cringe fest
Dylan watching Ratatouille is exactly what i needed in life
goddamn, just when I desperately needed this
Yessss this is one of my favorite Disney movies.
Dylan's reactions to the violence is giving me life
7:34  "oh yeah that's JUUCK, He's a redhead who has a hair pulling kink" this mf Dylan is too funny💀💀
this is my favorite part about mondays really, dylan you always get me through the day
Finally a movie where Dylan isn't wishing death upon anyone
STOP NAMING HIM PIERRRE LMAO
As an Italian I must say Dylan is doing the best Italian accent of all time.
Love your videos ❤Love from Portugal 🇵🇹
I can't believe he predicted the ghost (hallucination)  😂😂😂😂😂
Awe childhood favorite movie
damn we were so close to Monday! Keep trying Dylan u will get it!
Did you mean Raccacoonie?
I'm so happy I can't
the way when i saw u posted it made my day
Dylan's reactions are honestly the best, and I love that he looks things up so I don't have to 🤣
oh my joy, is it monday already??
It's actually Monday in parts of the world right now and I'm really concerned rn.
You should watch The Super Mario Bros Movie (2023)
You’re honestly the one YouTuber that always posts on schedule like how do you do it? Every single Monday for four years now! Let’s give this man the round of applause he truly deserves
OMG YESSS
“who gave this women A GUN?!!” “she’s prob in America..” SKDNNF💀💀
STOP THIS IS SO FUNNY Dylan: stop the violence-I would never be turned on by violence   Dylan any other commentary: KILLLLLLL, DEATHHHH, BLOOOODDDDD
*Still* *waiting* *for* *that* *friends* *video* *Dylan* *promised* *8* *months* *ago*
dylan ratatouille is french why the italian accent🙏

I am so fucking EXCITED for this!!!
Me: Entering a video about a french rat Dylan: making an italian accent Me: totally normal
Rattler. Ratman.
1:16 Your ego bouta' plummet because of a rat, my dude.
DYLAN I'M TRYING TO STUDY HERE
Love to see this because Dylan is absolutely linguini coded 🤣
Always happy to see another great video!!! 🤍🤍🤍🤍
DYLAN FEEDS US WELL WITH THESE CHOICES!!!
I swear I’ve seen you go that intro before.
Dylan is getting closer and closer to monday with his uploads.
Wow, I wasn’t aware that it was Monday today…
Wow! It only took two minutes for Dylan to want death! That may be a new record!
You know it’s a good day, when you’re rewatching a Dylan video and interrupted by a new one
i love that Dylan loves BMW as much as me
I love that Dylan is reacting to our childhood movies and posting them every single Monday
I’m going to cry rn, this is my fav movie and Dylan is finally reacting to it
EARLY I WAS THINKING ABOUT IF YOUVE UPLOADED A MOVIE REVIEW YESTERDAYY
Its 1 am, I should be a sleep but Dylan uploads and I am only human 🫠
I was literally just watching the 17 again commentary
❤Same here. Now I am always wondering if there are rats at the restaurants that we frequently visit.❤
He started with an accent and I knew I would never hear the end of it🤣
im so proud of myself for making it in 3 minutes
YESSS I LOVE THIS
'I'm pretty sure there's a job.'
DYLAN YOU LIKE BOY MEETS WORLD?! I OWN ALL THE SEASONS (I bought it predisney plus)
When Dylan uploads it makes my day❤Can I just say Dylan is hot and whoever says otherwise is wrong
not dylan acting like he didn’t enjoy the old lady shooting the rats 💀
Cant believe you posted yet another video on Monday! Keep up the good and consistent work
i’ve been waiting for this video my whole life
Honestly I enjoy Dylan watching cartoons more that anything else he watches lmaoo, these are just golden
Always a great day when Dylan drops a new video!
babaow
I’ve been waiting for the day when he would make this commentary  I would ask but he hates requests so I wish and wish and now it’s a Christmas miracle
Goddamn i'm  the first to watch and comment here😊

I love ratatouille more than anything
The nose piercing is what really keeps us  teens entertained

When the world needed him most, he returned
Is Dylan thinking about Flushed Away???
Hey Dylan, thanks for uploading on this fine Monday. Super glad your video came up, was having a bit of a bad day, now I'm feeling better. K see you next Monday yeah?😊
i’m scared to watch this knowing how dylan gets around animated animals 🧍‍♂️
Dylan and his fight with the space bar with always be funny to be
So happy to see this dylan!!! thank you :)
It’s amazing how he’s managed to make a video EVERY Monday for all these years 🙌🤩 the dedication is inspiring
I love this movie sm
The second I was this video said ratatouille I clicked on it so fast
W
I want to be a little Remy and Dylan to be my Linguini 🥰
the accent tho
ratatouille is top tier bro I’m hungry after every time I watch it
DYLAN! LOOK AT YOU BEING AHEAD OF SCHEDULE! YOU GO! YOU FUNKY LITTLE HUMAN. AMAZING. FANTASTIC.
I got COVID today and this is exactly what I freaking needed thank the lord
the way I just teleported here is so funny 💀
i was literally looking through his videos today for disney movies not even an hour ago
loving this upload on a monday, definitely a monday.
Yay my comfort channel has uploaded 🥰
dylan uploading movie commentaries on a monday. as always. so consistent.
Ratatouille is an absolutely fire movie, no Pixar movie is doing it like Ratatouille
But like on a real note, this is the best pixar film. Hands down.
Lmao they just made us watch this movie in CULINARY
I really loved the vibe of this video.
Be careful Dylan this is one of my favorite movies!
dylan i missed u so much wtf
Bestie can u please react to Knives Out 🥺🥺🥺
We missed you! I love this movie. Haven’t seen it in years
there were so many plots that could’ve been made out of this concept, and snl did one of them
i love movie commentary monday!
YES THE CONSISTENCY OF HIS UPLOADS AMAZES ME
MISSED YOU
We have waited years, centuries, eras to see you watch Ratatouille with a bad Italian accent on a day that’s (totally) Monday Dylan
Dylan, I’m warning you this is like my favorite Disney movie ever so be careful
Yaaaayyy 😂🎉
i love how dylan’s videos are always on mondays!
This video was great, I totally watched it all.  I did not murder my entire family in 1984
Dylan is looking good 🤭
OMG I LOVE THIS SO MUCH!!!
I love your obsession with clothes as pale as you, so everything blends together😍
Dylan starting the video with an Italian accent instead of a French accent gives me life.
I’m beyond more excited for this one 😂
What a beautiful Monday evening
Well well well
great video buddy
Another video dropped right on Monday. Your work ethic impeccable Dylan!
wow. for the first time in ever
I clicked SO FAST! Ratatouille is literally my favourite!!!! My day is already so much better❤️

Finally!!!!
c’est slay
What was the Italian accent about I thought it was French?
clicked on this so fucking fast
I literally stopped watching something else for Dylan
YES HES BACK
my fav movie
Yet again Dylan upload consistency always amazes me
I had a pet rat named Jester as a kid. I once put him on my head just to see if he would try to control me like Remy did. All I got was peed on.
Please, start doing games again!
not at dylan literally coming out wt a video 5 secs after me saying “wow i think i havent seen dylan in a while”

I LOVE U

Wow... I'm early
WOOHOO

Heyyy
*Who agrees with me that Dylan is the best person to look up to when you are upset, not feeling the best, or overwhelmed? he's always so positive and comical, which always puts a smile on my face even if I'm not feeling the best :)) we always love ❤️ you Dylan*
