"I'm in a regular truck with a camper, surely that isn't for me."
DIPSHITS WITH NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO INNER DIALOGUE AND KOMMUN !!!!!!!!!SENSE!!!!!!!!!!!
Nailed it
If I go slowly the bridge won’t notice.
0:43 …love the random metal piece fall on the ground..😂😂
These people are too stupid to have a drivers license...
Man it is too bad they dont have a big flashing sign to tell someone they are too tall.
This is the epitome of a American. :)
oops $$$$$$$
Honey, it’s getting hot in here why isn’t the AC working? 😮
HEY! He turned!
This bridge has been going on for years. This is bullshit.
Wonder if my brother in law will notice his AC unit is missing.
I just get out and deflate the tires.    Works every time!
I made a 14. Foot high trailer fit in a 13.9 bridge? I belie.\nVe it was in washington
I like to watch these videos in slow motion anyway. This guy just saves me the trouble! 😅
un woke evidament
$12,000+ in damages
あっ、取れてもいいやつだったのか？鳴らして損した、！😮
See, I told you it would fit.
It would be safer if America adopted and converted to the metric system.
No more problems for all the other bridges now .... well done mate 🤣😂
Why are people so dumb, not knowing the height of their vehicle before going under a low bridge ? It totally baffles me.
Most commercial scales have height poles that can accurately measure the height of roof mounted equipment and will either lend it or assist with proper usage.
do the ripper in council bluffs
"Don't worry honey I know a shortcut, but to go through the shortcut we must first sacrifice our air conditioning unit to the bridge gods"
I can imagine the yelling going on inside. Wife, “we’re not gonna fit!” Hubby, “relax! It’s fine. I got this.”
This bridge is of WORLD-FAME by now ! How come those locals don't know it yet ?
Those Russians aren’t too smart are they
IDIOT driver
Seriously. How much time did he save to make that worth it?
Like a glove
the honking drowned out the sound of the trailer actually breaking lol
Your consistency is inspiring—keep going
"It's cool I didn't like those things up there anyway."  --The driver
tsk tsk ... I think 'some' folks think their trailer height is low enough but forget that the vents and AC unit on top adds quite a bit of height.  Even though the bridge got raised awhile back I guess people are still hitting it.
Bridge wins again.
apparently, over height warning means "you got this, just go slower"
technically they did make it
Man stupid or what man
Funny😂😂😂😂😂when he's gonna say. Gee honey I'm starved, let's get in the camper, fix supper and turn on the air😅😅😅
Ignorent driver not suppose to drive this vehicle
Here where i live, there's a U-Haul truck rental office where as you walk in, there's a picture on the wall over the receptionist's desk of a truck that stuffed itself into an underpass and the caption reads : "Know your overhead" . It was stuck in just like it was a cork. The sobbering image sure makes you think.
Indoor people attempting outside stuff!🤔. Second thought. Another urban boob bringing their house to the great outdoors!😂😂😂
He is like What? I made it!
That is a special kind of stupid.
COMPLETE IDIOT with the BIG LIGHT CAUTION... and pass
Anyone who does that must be senile.
Do they think that driving slowly makes their vehicles lower or the bridge higher?
He just got a quote for R and R of that air conditioner. He saved a bundle on the first R.
Bridge doesnt care and you'll definitely take damage lol
Camper guy says:  "But, hey, I DID turn"
Trottel...
Guy hears a horn warning  and probably  feels the carnage but decides  what the fuck I'll  keep going  my rental  insurance  will cover it
Why is the yellow steel beam higher than the actual bridge?
"They must be honking at someone else!" -The driver, probably
Better go slower to shrink my car
Lovely, thank you 😊  Extra points for the useless yellow warning beam, which seats higher than the bridge. Good job.
Nice Trailer Cabrio he got there 😁
That was too close. - Lando
Pulling a trailer should be an added endorsement for class c drivers
The last insult is when the driver is pulling off to the left, a YouTube souvenir rolls off the top.  Classic tinkling sound.  Thank you yovo68!
Has the sign been replaced since they repaved over the road?
Going slow doesn't make you lower, mate
What a complete dumbass 🤷🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
Apparently it doesn't take interpretive or cognitive skills to buy a fifth wheel. This is dumb on several levels.
A driver must know how tall his trailer is, otherwise surprise! Surprise! And going slowly won't reduce the height of the trailer!
Someone could make a documentary about this bridge
I love the way the guy slows down but keeps going - as if that's going to help.
“I can fit because I’m the DMV’s special little boy” behavior
I respect the attempt of goin slow, to maybe attempt but maybe they shoulda opened a window for noise lol
A/C I miss thee
That blinking sign must detect what is coming up as being too high, that is awesome (if only people would read it lol)
Lots of money, no brains
I unbolted one of those ac units from a camper recently. Riping that off like that definitely caused roof damage too.
What I don't understand (after years of watching these) is WHAT RV drivers hope to ACCOMPLISH by going SLOWLY under the bridge? Either you will fit or won't fit and if you wont' fit, the expensive stuff on the roof will STILL get damaged (or removed) EVEN if you are going slowly.
If only they could put up some sort of sign on the bridge
What does the +8 mean?
The stupidity of these people astound me
RV needed equipment reduction so it would match the owner
Have you or anyone you know driven a truck into the “Can Opener” in Durham?? We want to talk with you about a unique video project. Please message me directly for more info.
This video only has one message. Look at the SDA
I saw a man driving a tri axle dump truck do the same exact thing with about 60,000 lb load and destroy the bridge and he didn't even slow down he was going about 25 Mi an hour when he hit it
that's what I call an upside down four-wheel drive
good news , its compliant now
They could dig under the bridge so that the road would go lower under it giving people more room.
Maybe if I drive slow enough it won't reach it. 😳😬🥴😉
Such bad engineering by the city, instead of putting up steel bars and endless warning signs they could have dug the road down so this sort of thing did not happen , safer for everyone especially the rail track.
People, people, people…you MUST know your vehicle height. Why is this so freaking difficult for you?
slow motion stupid.
다음엔 파손없이 지날수있다
Newbie mistake
The two signs say clearly 12 ft 4 inches. Why have they introduced a story of 11 ft 8 inches? Does someone get paid to add nonsense to stories?
Clark Griswold
Real   Smart  guy.
The camper finally got rid of stuff it did not need....you know what I mean?
I guess he was 11' 10"............
THINKING HE'S   E.  I<D>N  ! GOTTA BE ! That's HOW they DRIVE HERE in CANADA ! TAKE OUT OVERPASSES ALL the TIME, NOT a CARE IN the WORLD
Wow lets see a replay
Sunroof optional.
LOL  I love this channel
Just a little scratch they can  buff that out
These are the same type of idiots that would die before they miss their exit off the freeway.
So is the height 12'14 or 11'8?
I like at the end when the part hits the street. Nice!
Better ventilation without all that equipment... 😅
Is it 11’8” or 12’4”?
As a 5th wheel camper owner.....this is expensive
Everyone knows how it's going to end except for the ones in the truck. LOL!  Know your trailer height and when in doubt make the turn instead.
Sure the repairs was very expensive on that trailer.
The city is at fault here, they should add a flashing sign to let the driver know
Brilliant
More money than brains… But at that point, he was afraid to back up.
I wonder what that yellow paint and flashing sign mean?  It must mean to go.
Not too smart!
I laughed. I hope God forgives me
Guy be like - it was the winter time!!! Suckers!
Pourquoi mettre une barre d’avertissement 😢! si après la hauteur est PLUS BASSE ?  Les imbéciles sont,  les "ingénieurs ! " 😮 qui ont fait tous les calculs 😂!  Ė là, un élu a approuvé cette  Connerie ! 😅
it says 12.4
I think the stupid assed engineer who designed the height is the bigger problem.
The stupidity is mind numbing.
And this is why aliens don't mess with us. On his defense, the DOT should put a warning sign ways before the breach, this make no sense. I drive a camper too, but I know all my routes.
This never gets old!!! ❤😂🎉 Thanks for creating this channel... 😊❤🎉🙏
Made it ok…
Not sure?? Mayb let some air outta tires!
That explains Americans perfectly
If you don’t know how tall you when Towing’s a big camper you probably shouldn’t be in the first place! That dummy just did $1000s worth of damage if not totaled it since most of those items are secured to roof frame!
Some people shouldn't go out in public without a guardian 😅😅
Snow plow ... roof style. Bonus dust scrapper in summer. 😅
You have to appreciate the commitment  to see this mistake through.
Democrats
Oh well. We’ll just fix it later.
They should put a decapitation sign numbering the amount of victim to the bridge next to the height sign, but that might hurt the feelings of some of our overly sensitive people in this country! Kinda like HAPPY THANKSGIVING, MERRY CHRISTMAS, and we are going to have a good NEW YEAR this year after four years!
Just some of the stuff came off the roof.  No problem.  Real problem.
I believe it's now time for the railroad companies with these overpasses should raise their Bridges and such 20 ft above the road for clearance and you wouldn't have this problem and plus two it make it easy for truck drivers specially with big loads that have got to squeeze underneath such what 11 ft 8 in monstrosities to have to go around a 20 to maybe a 50 me detour on the count of this railroads nonsense.
8 yıl önce ya köprüyü yükseltin yada zemini alçaltın demiştik hala yapmamışlar
He should sue the salesman who said his trailer was 11’ tall.
The Glenville Bridge, Glenville NY
If he was smart he would have let his tyres down before going under the Bridge 🤦‍♂
why do the signs read 12' 4
YARD SALE 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤙🤙🤙
That camping trip was cut short😂😂😂
Typical Democrat..
11’8” but why does the sign say 12’4”?
That warning sign needs to be located somewhere so the driver can see it or flashing lights on the sides of the bridge.
Seriously...This is how God separates the sheep from the goats? This gonna take a really long time.
Why did he keep going? Lol. Could he not hear what was happening? Lol.
Well he's got air conditioning now.
We live in a fifth wheel full time traveling all over the USA and canada, this is our worst nightmare we use a garmin RV890 to keep us out of trouble, it knows our height and keeps us off routes that have low bridges, but warns us if we are approaching one by mistake.  I guess this guy didnt have one.
Bring your lawn hair and cooler full of your favorite beverages and enjoy the show!
There should be another sign that says turn left here to pull over and pick up all the crap you left in the middle of the road!
Several grand in damages.
He’s American, he doesn’t care, he can buy more junk outsourced goods to put on top of it.
Amazing they just keep going. When contact heard, stop, inspect, back-up. Common sense
I can’t stop laughing.
Please……lower the bar to 6’6” .
That RV roof top units are either his satellite service or his A/C unit either way it will not be cheap to fix. Reminder always know the height of your rig and allow for an extra  foot just to be safe. My Prevost motor home has a GPS with built in height and width adjustments you can enter. Of course I paid 3 million for it
I love these videos because it shows just how stupid people are today. And then the city goes ahead and ruins it buy raising the height
I wonder how many of these people think “I measured ahead of time and I clear the max height by an inch, I’ll be fine.”
Guarantee it’s a male driver.
IDIOTS HAVE VO BUSINESS DRIVING
What an idiot. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The monster that ate every overly tall vehicle. Will we get to 1000 victims?
+8 written with a sharpie because it saves money.
buy a tent you wussies
Expensive Day! -an old friend did something similar with his parents' RV: kind'a saw it coming but said "What the hell!" -and went for it anyway! The "hell" part came later when he explained all this to his Dad!  Never lend your vehicles to idiots, even if they are family!
These are the kind of people we have to share the roads with?  Unbelievable!
Absolute Genius...
Goes slow because he knows he's high. Sees the sign, still goes. Hits stuff and hears it sheering, keeps going. Gets honked at and told to stop... keeps going.
going slower makes you lower
would cost driver less to remove all air from tires and ruin the tires than pay for the upstairs damage.
whenever I am feeling like the most stupid person on the planet I visit this website = instant relief.
Hey Gertrude the AC isn't working again
Slowing down won't make your camper lower DOH !!! Are some people just plain dumb and blind ??😂
I love seeing dumb stuff like that especially when there's a big lighted up sign just beautiful
I love how the one pickup driver blowing his horn, going the same speed and trying tell him not to do it.  Then the car behind him joins in with the horn blowing, either to join in telling the driver to not do it, or because the pickup was obstructing him.
Slowing down makes vehicles shorter, this should have worked.....
Maybe they could put a more flexible hanging height thing right before the beefy one that will scrape against a vehicle before drivers cause more damage to themselves or the bridge 🤔
What is the fine for striking the bridge? Cause it should be expensive.
They ruined their whole vacation just to take a shortcut.
"Just a little off the top, thanks."
Why stop when you can just go slow and rack up the cost in damage slowly instead of preventing it to begin with. That's going to be an expensive repair.
I would've just stop the moment I heard damaged parts, but this one just calmly proceed
That guy's gonna walk into a local repair shop all embarrassed, thinking he's gonna be the stupid guy they talk about for years to come, only for one of the guys to just shout "Jerry! The bridge got another one!" as soon as he arrives lol
Obviously, the signs don’t work.     This bridge was probably made for some repair company to keep working job Security.    This is      BULL SHE IT.    GOT IT.      FIX. THE  PROBLEM.     OH NO, WE CAN’T DO THAT THEN WE WON’T HAVE ANY VIDEOS OF TRUCKS  CRASHING INTO THE BRIDGE.    THEY RUN PERFECTLY GOOD YOUTUBE CHANNEL
Ah da  Can’t fix stupid
99% made it thru, close enough! LMAO !
that's a dumb ass READ THE SIGHN !!!!
Hey, he made the green light...... That night at the camp ground. ...."Honey, I thought you said you turned on the AC?"
Whenever I think that it looks like it’ll fit, it doesn’t
It's just the AC units.  CHEAP FIX...
Like a glove….
Oh, the stupidity of humans.
I am stuck on stupid and stupid  stuck on me lol
What an idiot!
That'll do
Pesky rooftop ac units
This just goes to show how stupid people are. This has been going on for over a decade. Doesn't matter how many signs or warning lights they installed, people don't care.
More money than brains.
What a donkey!
He has no business driving an RV.If he doesn’t know his height limit he is clueless.
you'd think a person would be more careful with something that has a six-figure pricetag...
I can understand all the rental truck drivers not knowing what they were doing, but if you are an RV-er, you should know how tall your rig is. Ffs
I bet his wife gave him Hell when he told her the AC was out.
It not really news as so many people do it constantly
Bet that $450 Garmin RV 795 is looking like a bargain about now.
Who needs air-conditioning 😂😂😂😂
Made it.
I guess driving really slow will make your trailer lower.
how did she get her license
The clattering pieces of a/c falling off the top slayed me. 🤣🤣
The saddest part of all this is if you turn left before the bridge & travel 50 yards, the next street drives over the tracks. It is shown to be that way in the can-opener video.
Maybe the clearence isn't 12'4".
A flashing sign. Warnings from other drivers.  Yeah not for me, let's continue.
I would ask my fat wife to sit in the trailer that would lower it by a couple of inches. 👍
Can't friggin drive. Runs over curb right after
Por qué no ponen cadenas ⛓️ de aviso antes, eso es una estupidez
"Slow down hun, we don't want to rip our a/c off too quickly!"
And just like that my camping days was over.
i dont really understand how people can be so damn dumb, anybody?
Parabéns!
brilliant
Maybe if they attach a huge, highly visible yellow bar to the bridge, put some warning lights up and a couple giant signs this will stop happening.
hey , the overhang got new airco!
Just stupid
RVers are the dumbest.
What an asshole
i will never understand how people are willing to risk damaging their property rather than just find an alternate route
Bah!  What does this warning sign know!  Oh well...  Didn't need that stuff anyway.
🤣
In ONE fell swoop of goodbye to; internet, air conditioning, television,,,,,;man, tha t sucks.   I have faith the family is out there somewhere having vacations , better than EVER
Now it Fits!!
The reason this low bridge has never been corrected is not because it's financially difficult. It's because everyone loves the Mayhem. After 85 years, there simply is no other reason.
Stupid is as stupid does!
Any landing you can walk away from is good, right?
Isn't there a bar/cafe that has front row seating to this fun?
Its about time for the railroad to raise the bridge. Should have never been that low to begin with.
I don't understand why someone pulling a fifth wheel that likely cost over $100k would even risk going under that bridge. If I saw an overpass like that coming up while pulling that monster I'd immediately look to turn and go around it. Is going five or ten minutes out of the way to not cause thousands of dollars of damage really that big of a hassle?
"It's fine it's fine its fine its not fine its not fine fuck fuck shit shit okay okay"
I like the driver keeps going and doesn't care about the damages !
It might've worked if he went just a little bit slower.
Does anyone know about how much it would cost to repair this damage?
Idioten
by bye AC units
He was going for the "energy-saving-no-air-conditioning" modification.  Success!!!
my buddy drove a box truck for a company for many years and they were located just on the other side of a low bridge. he drove under that bridge for years, every day that he worked for them. They surprised him with a brand new truck one day. first time driving it he rips the top off of it. company wasn't happy but then it was kind of their fault too, like my buddy said, we drive that route every day making deliveries why would you buy a truck that doesn't fit under that bridge?  if i remember correctly that bridge is marked 13.8, been a while since i been that way seeing i know the truck I drove doesn't fit either.
Just a little off the top please….
Crazy
"Maybe if i drive slow enough the bridge will raise up a bit"
That if you confess that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the Dead you will be saved
Duh!!!!!!  Not too bright a driver -  and people honked their horn at them.
What a stupid idiots!! U got to know your clearance😂
awww.  The eight extra inches has taken a lot of the fun away. It used to be so satisfying to see travel trailers and RVs have the AC units swept clean off the tops to be dropped behind the bumper.
Who you are. MY CONDOLENCES.
the sign at the end killed me
As Neilson from the Simpsons would say  .... "HA HA!"
So people 🙄🙄🙄
That's a good way to get rid of all that shit on the roof. He lined it up perfectly.
If you're going to risk it, at least let some air out of the tires.
He kept going so that it would fit next time.
WHAT A F¥€KING CLOWN SHOE!! 🤦🏻‍♂️
People don't read. They don't pay attention to signs, warnings, speed limits, or danger signs or even grocery store coupons.  All they see is a sign,  a speed limit, or save 60 cents on a coupon yet, pay no attention to the specific brand, size or quantity..  They could put a flashing neon sign with font the size of the Eiffel Tower at the approach of this bridge and trailers, trucks, moving vans, and 18-wheelers would still proceed thru and rip the top off the trailers. Lord--------------help us all ! ! !
It is a real shame there is just absolutely no way to tell whether or not you'll make it under.
He didn't really need any of that, right?
Im so glad this channel still exists. Been a staple through all of my phases for like the last 12 years. These never cease to make me smile
That was perfect, everyone honked their horns so he couldn't hear his A/C being ripped off.
DRIVER:  This sign can't possibly be for ME...
"If i just drive real slowly, maybe i will fit under the bridge."
ive been laighing just watching all  these uploads. i dont if this is your job or you just enjoy waiting for these precious moments. I assume the impacts are detected on that yellow bar and then auto saves the recording for review. Interested to know how it works.
It's because he is driving a truck. Pickup truck drivers think rules and instructions are challenges.
Fun Fact: Even campers can be put in reverse.
And thosE RV air conditioner units ain’t cheep.
Its weird because he slow it down to be sure hes fine. Thats perfectly normal, he turn the bridge.... But continue foward lol
As an award for his incredibly stupidity, he'll now be watching old VHS tapes in his RV tonight.
There are a few fairly low overpasses on some routes when you are driving to New York City from the north via Connecticut. When I rented an RV motorhome to take my family to Disney in Florida from Massachusetts, we drove all the way out to Scranton, Pennsylvania, and then South to DC, rather then accidentally end up on the wrong road and hit a bridge or get stuck with no way back. It took an extra hour, but it was totally worth it for the peace of mind. I definitely paid attention to bridge height signs everywhere I went.
The bicycles made it
As a retired HVAC guy, this was hilarious 😂
A cautionary tale about weed and driving an RV.
People who should have never had a license  How on earth do you see the red light turn green, but not the HUGE flashing "Overheight" sign? Maybe they dont speak English? I don't know
This bridge is overly strict!
Was he trying to crouch drive?
Driver slows down.... Can I make it? Sure I can Sure I can It'll be o.k. It'll be all right Just gotta go real slow..... Sneak right in there Yeah.....
This is the equivalent of talking to a foreigner very slowly in a language they don't understand. The speed is not the problem.
What's hilarious is that he probably thought he had cleared it until he got a look at his camper later and realized, "Oh... I guess I didn't."
Average US IQ example. 3
The amount they have to pay out now is inverse to their intelligence. Nature works so well if you leave him/her/it alone.
I like how everyone is beeping their horn and the guy just keeps on going
This is why you need to know your tow vehicle height before you decide to modify it with a sun roof.
“So, how many braincells do you’ve got?”  “-How many what?”
boomers gonna freak
I have been watching this channel for many years and just realized today where this bridge is located - Durham NC, quite close to Duke University.  I am figuring that I have most probably driven under this bridge a few times without recognizing that this is the 'can opener bridge'.
I know the flashing sign says "over height must turn" and only comes on for vehicles over the height, but people are really really really stupid, they should change the sign to say "You are over height You must turn now"
might have made it ,,,,,,, with no air in the tires
Ah, yes... The old "It'll fit if I can just go slow enough..."
"No, honey! Google maps says I need to go straight!!"
this clip never  gets old. On the bright side: next time he will have no problem getting thru there  and you do not need a/c and generators anyway
"Why is everyone honking at.... oh no my camper is fked."
He crept under it, heard the crack - but just went through anyway!
The camper really doesn't need those fancy vent covers!  I have an old camper and it doesn't have any! Those covers are just fancy addons!   In fact, without those fancy covers, the vent can open way higher than intended!
Slowing down reduces the impact energy by the slowdown squared .  Loosing some paint and decorations is not dangerous, just annoying .  Anyway, they'll be fine with only the other AC unit .
Driver: hehe it's fine see? Cars: NO DUMBASS IT'S NOT
All good ....
I didn't want that equipment anyway
Why does the sign say 12' 4"?
Yea, usually a horn blowing means Stop doing the stupid thing that you are doing.
It aint a damn speed bump dude!
Know the height of your rig -- including A/C, etc. Post it on your dashboard.
The sign says 12'4".... so lawsuit insues :)
I bet, to be extra cautious, they ducked down in their seat too! 😂
He was supposed to turn before The bridge, not after it 😂
It's just a flesh wound. Keep moving.
Guys lucky looks like he only lost the air vent.
Its a bullshit, most of the vehicles can clearly clear the bridge and the only thing that does the damage is this bullshit metal bar..
Why not measure the camper height after buying it and put a posted on the dashboard?
Could have just let the tyres down a little
Do you know if you drive slower, your vehicles height decreases by almost a foot?
It’s amazing how stupid some people are! Then again, maybe it’s not so amazing!
smartest ford f150 driver:
I don't understand it could have been nothing but he kept going
What I don't understand is why the signs  show 12' 4"
Not the other people honking to try and tell them but they DONT CARE AND KEEP GOINGS 😭
Bikers fault
Bless their hearts! 😂
"Jesus take the Wheel" J: are you illiterate?
I like the fanfare those drivers played on their horns to honor the equipment.
It is always funny when they apparently think that somehow going slower will help
Does it really save that much time going under and damaging your vehicle?
I can imagine what was said in that truck 💀  "am I gonna clear it?" .. "just barely"
that's the way to do it; savor every second of it!
well at least he saves some fuel by not taking the long route
Hope it wasn’t a rental.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Another stupid video by stupid people.
"Going slow makes me smaller! I'll be fine!"
This guy:  "F it we ball"
Maybe the person thought the sound of their equipment breaking off was just one of those test barriers bumping the roof.
"Maybe if I go really slow the bridge won't notice me."
WAFI!
Just a LITTLE off the top this time, please!
Ya but think of all the moneyhe saved by not getting a hotel room
People tried to warn him but he just kept going :(
Don’t you love seeing asshole people give themselves asshole problems?!
"If I get slower, I'll be lower" 🤠 That's what he must have thought.
So . Was it a guy driver or a female driver with the spouse / partner blowing their gasket with  “ I told you “   ringing in their ears ?
It's too late to stop now..
Somebody this stupid has to be a trump supporter!
Immortalized on YT - priceless. New AC unit, antenna, vents, roof repair...not priceless.
Now it fits XD 😉🥳
lol    ...
LMAO
Well, he DID find the shortcut.........to the RV shop for some expensive repairs. Must have voted for Biden.
Perhaps this driver didn't think to measure everything on top of the trailer? Then he drives off like, "It was a little tight but I made it". Wait until he gets to the campsite.
He could have just deflated the tires of the camper to make it a couple of inches lower
Regardless of the idiocy of the driver, why is it that people honk horns at them as if they can just get out of your way because of whatever? That bothers me more than this guy trashing his camper!
Damn the torpedoes!full speed ahead!
Judging by the fact that he slowed to a crawl is proof that he understood the danger, but decided to gamble and lost so now he now gets to go to the RV dealer for repairs.
Almost did some damage to the neighboring car at 0:41 dropping a vent stack onto it
Natural selection of sorts.
Is the yellow warning bar at 11'8" and the bridge clearance 12'4"?
Dude just cost himself thousands, probably more than 10
Guy with a measuring tape , waiting by those lights , could make a few bucks .
So much for that camping trip.🤷🏻‍♂️
Maybe the flashing sign is telling me the tiny car next to me is gonna hit the top. Yeah that must be it, I am just gonna drive very slowly under and watch them ruin their sedan. 😂
Honey, I thought this new RV had AC.
Yeag the guy was gunna gwt it removed just drove 120 miles to the garage just on the other side of the bridge so all he needed to do was reurout home
How stupid are these people? There's already a flashing sign, he already knows that it's too low because he's inching his way under and there's cars honking at him for him to stop when is trailer is being damaged! He probably has college degrees but no common sense!
I guess people think that if you go slower, you'll become lower... lol
I love the cult following of this bridge! 😂
“Honey! We aren’t going to make it!”  Oh, we’ll be fine. I’ll just go slow.
perfect dolboyob
why the sign says 12 foot....if the bridge is 11 foot....
Air conditioners are overrated 🙄 anyway😂
Welp, you can't fix stupid
That bridge must be a democrat
Well, could of been A LOT worse! Whole roof could of been torn off.
Wonder if people will start driving old trucks under just so they can become YT famous. haha
I like to imagine george carlin often haunts this bridge with some ghost popcorn just watching the parade.
“Maybe if I just keep going it’ll work itself out.”
I think this bridge eats more RV AC units than anything else… 😂
Slower ≠ Shorter
I almost want to make a pilgrimage to this bridge, just so I can pay my respects in person to its enduring legacy.
Poorly worded & vague sign.  One could read it and think that its always on and flashing that 'overheight vehicles need to turn.'  IMO, it needs to be dumbed down to read... "IF THIS SIGN IS ON, YOU WILL HIT THE BRIDGE" or something similar. With that being said, one should always know their vehicle/trailer's height.
If I go realllyyy sllooowww maybe it'll get lower.
Riker's Island?
The camping trip from hell
Only in America. And every other place except Scandinavia.
Maybe if I go slow the bridge will get higher?
no more aircon
Meh... who needs all that extra junk on top of the camper anyways...? lol
Lower the pavement?
yeahhhhhhhhhhh.... So gratifying....
When you thought you were just dumb but quickly found out your actually dumber
my man really interpreted the horns as encouragement
I think reducing air in tires might have helped this poor guy
This is the worst. Driver doesn't have to be anywhere on time, they can travel at their own luxury, yet still manages to go under a bridge too low.
Can't believe he just keeps going while all the cars are honking and stuff is crashing.. driver must have some mental disability.
You can’t fix stupid
The Ferryman demands his toll.
The only way to fix this.. is just allowing small cars only. Like on the old bridges where small cars only allowed.
Just few inches more would have been better 😢
Why won't they turn? How far is the go-around?
Why don’t they just excavate the road five feet down and then repave- problem solved!
if I stab my foot slowly... it won't cut me
I would never want to bang my head against the beam so make sure to stop my bike and do calculations.
Stop…stop…stop…stop. I guess the driver didn’t hear me. Stupid is as stupid does.
Honey, the air conditioning doesn't seem to be working.
Really? You have a patreon when all you do is share pre recorded clips?
You just know the driver was having an argument with his wife when they slowed down.
Perhaps, if they improve the signage...
Ouch!
STILL KEPT THE AIR CONDITIONER!
That guy thought he was really sneaky when he went slowly, but the bridge still got 'im!
Damn rednecks
We need footage of the other side when they stop to look at that shit 🤣🤣🤣
I hate people in comments so much.  Anyways, as I see this, it was somewhat reasonable to _atleast_ go slower because it won't rip anything apart unlike so called "can opening" happening at big speeds
And a large mechanical turd was all that was left.
Very intelligent driver. Easily the top of single digit IQs
Dude knows he's not going to fit.  And did it anyway.  #Merica
Why don't they just lower the asphalt?
Just a trim off the top 👌
Lmao its like the beam hypnotizes drivers and they cant turn away
Manufactured by Forest River, owners were already unhappy with it off-the-curb.
Don't they realize that objects get smaller as they go faster and not slower? If he could have made his run at 88% light speed, his trailer would have been 12% smaller and would have made it.
The sign says 12'4"  is that not the correct height? If so it seems like a major lawsuit an 8" difference is a lot
Lol
“Overheight must turn” huh I wonder who that’s for…
So close.
I feel much better about myself after watching these. Sometimes I can think “why did I do that” but then I remember I don’t drive slow to make me smaller to fit under a bridge…
lol this channel is hilarious
“Just fucking go around” they think they’re saving time. With no clue that they’re about to waste time and money.
THERE'S NO GOING BACK
If I sneak the space wont see me coming and let its guard down and expand
Once your foot is on the gas, keep going.  Fuck it 😂
Maybe the sign is too complicated!  They should make this an experiment to see what works best, if anything.  MAYBE a giant screen with 4-foot high flashing RED block letters screaming out STOP NOW!, combined with a piercing air horn or 130-decibel recording of crash sounds?  Just an idea.
There’s apps online that show you the low bridge hazards if you route plan beforehand , I know a trucker, and he uses them all the time
Person driving: "All men are forced to make difficult decisions, this is mine, and I have come too far."
You just know that about halfway through he’s like “fuuuckk” but he has to keep going anyways😂
With every video I’m getting more convinced that even monkeys are allowed to get a drivers license…
He was not mentally ready to turn around. The thought of stopping in the middle of the road and backing that trailer was too much. He picked the path of least resistance (mentally)
86 IQ: They never learn. 92 IQ: Bridge is too low.
How mush stubid human can be?
Whelp, stupidity doesn’t get you far
This Bridge: *exists* Lowrider mfs: ya ima just. Car: **Vvvrrrrrrrrrrrr**
you do have to be an idiot to buy an rv
Ah yes, because your speed totally affects how tall you are.
Dude thought if he went slow enough the bridge wouldn't see his truck
Another fine example of why humans are one of dumbest animals on the planet 😂😂. Ignore warning signs and destroy your hard earned property in hopes the sign is just kidding 😂😂
At least he got through...
It's more aerodynamic now, scrape those barnacles off!
Unbelievable
They didn’t even have the slightest clue that 3 cars beeping at them was any indication that their roof was being sheered off
Oh for god sake
You can’t fix stoopid
idióta barom 👍🤣
americans 🤡
WHAT THE FUCK HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
There is a yellow  bar that is meant to be just  lower than the bridge, it is higher.  Not the drivers fault.
All this damages should should be blamed at the city, there is very easy solution for this and is to lower the road
According to their logic, if you go slow enough you can walk through walls
For years, idiots drivers think they can go under the bridge with out damaging anything.
They can't move the train track, but they can dig the road and make the road deeper
Why does the sign say 12' 4"
if you had someone standing in front of the car screaming with a machine gun pointed at the driver and a tornado alarm speaker blaring "YOU ARE TOO TALL, YOU WILL NOT FIT UNDER THE BRIDGE", people would still plough through it.
People honking and they just keep on trucking lort Jesus
1.  I wonder how many hits the train bridge can withstand until a a train pulling 12tankers of ‘ Vinyl Chloride-Phosgene & Hydrogen Chloride’ crashes down onto a school bus filled with children?  Not to mention families and friends loaded into their Ford Expeditions, Jeep Wagoneer  or Chevy Surburbans on a road trip.  Here we are drooling over these snafu’s while laughing at the stupidity of the drivers in these trucks.  2.  Lower the road under the bridge a foot and repave it now before the obvious potential of another disaster occurs.  We need to get our infrastructure corrected.  Biden’s trying to re-enstate regulations but he’s up against the $$$ grubbing  1%.  Seriously think about this.
Лишняя
With that much mass, and how easily stuff breaks up there, he probably was trying to feel for an impact and just didn't feel anything, thinking he was fine. I pull a travel trailer, and I know that it sits at 11'3", so I don't even try anything under 12'6". I don't have money to waste on dumb mistakes..
Well, he tried very slowly but........ Nope 😂
"I've never liked the stuff on the top of my camper.."
I don't know why these videos make me so happy. I've done a lot of dumb stuff and I can just hear the conversation in the car of his wife probably yelling he's not gonna make it but he assures her he knows what he is doing ... those were some very, very expensive fixes. Especially if the roof got it on the other side that we couldn't see.
It's not marked very well.
Too funny
How stupid are some people???? I mean thank god for them to entertain us but duh!!!
Dümmer geht nicht 😂
Camper driver : Idiot people alerting me to the height of the bridge as if I were stupid, they don't see that I was able to pass without any problem , get a life .
Hmm I find it a bit odd it cleared the yellow warning beam.
SMFH...
Perhaps remove the confusion and PUT 11'8" signs vs 12'4"...  Still hard to watch this one...
"if i go slow that'll somehow make it so my trailer is lower"
Liberal idiot
We had a big trailer that was a full complete 13" tall, THEN we added one of those race decks up there that folds down.  So that's another 4". We left downtown Ft Worth after an arenacross and there is a long underpass coming out, really long. AND they have paved it just now, cones are still out.  We had been trying to sell it, so I called the boss, yea, 12'6" underpass here, you want me to drive under it ....the boss thought awhile and said, no, kids are in the truck.  hahahaha this is exactly what it would have looked like.  I love the crunching sound here.
Love it.....oops!
Some people should not buy 5th wheels.
the drivers dont realize the sign is specifically talking to them. They think it's generally saying "If you're overheight, you must turn" but it's literally saying "YOU ARE OVERHEIGHT AND YOU MUST TURN"
"How do I get rid of superfluous ballast"
Case y’all didn’t know over the years 99% of all the damage done here was college grads!! Some even from Harvard.🤦🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️
Stupid people doing stupid things
welp, at least the a/c over the main bedroom was spared  fart fan is gone. hope they dont eat taco bell on the way to camp
I guess he wasn't smart enough to read the flashing sign telling him to turn.
Place your bet and take your chances.
They just wanted to make it onto the channel 😂
“We didn’t need the ac compressor or the radio antenna right?”
Sign says 12' 4".
It’s gonna be wet and muggy in that trailer in a week or 2
This stupid city , town is more concerned  about a f#uckin over pass then people being able to move freely around....  lift the damn overpass up and take the dumb steel beam down....  I d be pissed  if I lived in that town....  every town has access to money for these situations...
what a doofus
Honey, why isn’t the ac working?
Ignant is as ignant does!! Bubba.
like a cheese grader peeling away some cheese lol
The stupidity is unreal with these folks.
They should lower the wreckingbar  by six inches every time there is an accident!
Is it a wrong sign?
Fuq yeah
Idiots must suffer.
Why is this so wonderful?
It's amazing how many people think going slower somehow makes their car shorter.
Why?  Why? Can this person be found and interviewed?  I just have to know....WHY?
It should say overheight must turn or you will be fined $5000!!!
I love that this bridge has its own website.
While I find these videos funny, I am floored by the fact that the city does not close the road, dig a trench and make it a feasible option for all motorists. This is obviously a main road. This page clowns on these idiots, and there's a ton of them. Why not fix the road?
What a ding dong
OVER HEIGHT MUST TURN Driver: I’ll slow way down
Nelson Muntz…. Take it away
I've sat in my RV, in a lot and watched an underpass wondering if my RV had room, until a school bus went through that was higher than RV. Sometimes the height isn't right on the overpass due to road paving over the years.
......SPEND  IT!!😂
THE DRIVER WAS JUST TRYING TO MAKE HIS TRAILER MORE AERODYNAMIC BY ELIMINATION EQUIPMENT THAT CREATES WIND RESISTANCE
He said fuck it 😂
It’s ok.  He didn’t need those air conditioning units.  😂
If it wasn't for those raised hatches it would have made it, why did they design then as bubbles instead of inline with the roof?
Wie blöd muss ich werden ?
A slow and grueling $2500-4000 grand repair. Replace all those broken off baffolds.
Please tell me why they can't just raise this bridge? If I were mayor of this town I'd fix the problem and be a hero..but maybe this is all the town is known for and they like it? Seems rediculous and embarassing to me to have this problem
Dumbass
I feel sorry for that bridge. It's been beaten up more times than a slow horse...
They should put an explosive device on the bridge to REALLY stop idiots from not heeding the warning
YouTubers...get a life for Christ's sake!
Every one of you that have been warned on how low the bridge is, deserve ALL of the damage done to you lol😂
But the rules don’t apply to me!!  I’m special and smarter!!
Just because you can afford a camper doesn't mean you should buy one. You might want to consider Holiday Inn Express. 😂
Well that was an expensive repair! 😮 People are so stupid. 😂
Driver of the truck: "It's alright. Just a little scratch."
What a Toss Pot, he slows down knowing his height is under question, doesn't both to stop and look first, but the total fool decides to proceed on and thus "levels off the roof".
Perhaps adding the Black Knight from Monty Python & The Holy Grail; He could stand there with a double edged sword and bull horn: "None Shall Pass".
Im tired of seeing this. Just rip up the asphalt, over x the fking soil a few feet and remove about 5 ft of base and subbase. How fking hard is this.
"Must be a Trump supporter" - liberals "Must be woke" - conservatives "Must be an American" - rest of the world
So what's the height - 12'4" or 11'8" ??  I'm really confused seeing this, I could have ended up in a crash maybe myself if I had been driving a high vehicle through here..
There like fuck it were already committed might as well keep going
This guy's roof might have leaked and his AC quit working long ago and all this fixing is now paid by his insurance. Been looking for a low overpass for awhile now.
So dumb. Hope the insurance sees this and doesn't cover the damages
Damn 😮
good job your horn really helped
Typical american, can’t comprehend a road sign , to impatient to go around.  I’m surprised they don’t have a cop standing there to shoot him him and get him off the road.    Don’t get mad at me for my comment, I just watched a vid of 3 pigs beating up a guy that was riding a bike at night without a light.
Hey man nice trailer
Oooops, someone doesn't know the height of their vehicle.
stuuuuuupid 😢
(L)
The dopey daughter in law with a 6’6” wide trailer and 6’0” between gate posts comes to mind here. It was crazy that even after she’d seen the things measured, she says” maybe if she drove in at at an angle it would be okay” well NOT ruled that day amusingly.
" I guess we didn't need that stuff..." My favorite bridge in America!
Who needs AC anyway?
I guess I’m guilty of schadenfreude because I love watching this channel
There really are some dumb people down there 😂😂😂
just made it
Sign says 12' 4"... the city should be sued into oblivion.
What a complete plonker 😂
Vacation Ruined!
That's alright she's insured
The @sshole blowing his horn sort of ruined the experience.
Put a dip in the road!
Never gets old watching this! You would think that someone towing a huge trailer would be uber  aware but I guess not.
A democrat.
Who needs Air Conditioners or Vents when you’re Camping in that kind of Style ? 🤪👎
You can not fix "STUPID" 😅🤣😂
Democrats...
Slow motion MAGA driver.
This is exactly why we sold our huge fifth wheel and downsized to a 25ft Class C. Many overpasses, especially, in older parts of the country, aren’t equipped to handle a tall motorhome. Once you’re there, it becomes almost impossible to reverse and back up. Simplify.
I wonder how many are just insurance scams?? No person with that nice of truck and trailer could be that stupid or they couldn't afford the rig, other than Govt workers named Biden!!
Funniest thing remains there's a railroad crossing just one block away, people still opt for damage than potentially having to wait for a temporarily closed railroad crossing.
ooooppsss😂
dumbie
Just keep going !! it's fine!
The ole "slow down makes the camper shorter" trick.  Only David Copperfield was able to pull that one off sir.
In Australia we say... Bloody Idiot!
So what’s the story behind this bridge? The signs say 12’ 4” but the actual clearance is 11’ 8”. Is that not a state DOT issue?
the guy is like "hell no, I'm not turning around"
Think of all that FREON he will save without those AC units! 😊
Somebody paint teeth on that bright yellow beam made to warn drivers that cant read english, or know their measurments
He may have looked up from his phone and said to the kids, "What's that noise?" LOL
NO   Steel  I-beam was harmed in anyway .
And just kept going even after the first item was peeled off... Did they not hear the crunching?🤔
We have a low railroad bridge in Cleveland, TN. that has been able to withstand MANY stupid drivers .  One afternoon , I saw a brand new semi truck attempt to pass under it.  It was fantastic to  observe in person.  Was I had my camera that day.  LOVE these vids !
Hes good. Just wont have any air conditioning.
The signs say 12"4'
As a 5thWheel owner it amazes me that people don't know the height of their rig.
i got this, hold my beer
"Over Height Must Turn"   Don't cast pearls before swine.
You almost need to hire someone to stand there and measure there unit for them and tell them you gotta back up and turn there lol
At least he turned after the bridge.
Don't care....buy another one...
Wait, so if the bridge has a clearance of 11'8" then why do the signs says 12'4"? What am I missing here?
soooo, he works for swift on week days................................sure wish I finished Training.......swift
BIG FLASHING LIGHT WARNS MOTORISTS THEY ARE TOO HIGH AND MUST TURN, YET THEY IGNORE THE WARNINGS AND CONTINUE TO DRIVE UNDER BRIDGE WHICH TAKES OFF THE TOP OF THEIR  VEHICLES!!!  IDIOTS!  POOR PENSKE TRUCK RENTALS SURE TAKES IT IN THE SHORTS!!!!
Ahhh the ol "It's cool ya'll, we're from Texas." approach.
If I go slow-it makes my rig shorter....
They should put some sort of flashing sign warning drivers if they are over the height limit. What a shame.
Kinda not fair since the sign says 12 foot 4
"just take a lil off the top"
Should've gone slower
Ooooh it's nothing just a weekend fast shaving
Gowing slow ,so that nobody notice... Like a ninja 😂
The sign told him he was too high, he knew he was too high, but he figured if he went slow it would somehow work out.
Idiot. Thanks to the drivers honking at his Dumas
Why???!!?
Absolute Morons !!!!
My brain hurts 🤯😖. Was the world always this retarded!
As Jesus said at the OJ trial, "like a glove."
i guess he wont be needing those.
The number of idiots in this world is staggering.
The hungriest bridge eats again.
Yes sir?? “Salesman, how tall is this trailer ?” That would be 12 feet mister.  “So it will fit under 11’ 8” right???” Absolutely sir, just sign here!!! You KNOW the guy’s wife is just screaming at him to turn.  Love it.
Most of the idiots in the world are concentrated in the USA.
God people are dumb
Should be a scaffold bar across well before the bridge, if you can’t get under that you won’t get under the bridge.
What an absolute muppet
Use the active voice, such as "danger: you are overheight" instead of the passive, generic warning "overheight must turn". I seen another video where they have a low bridge and hung a shark monster cartoon banner saying "I eat trucks" (search for it!).
Not quite as planned. Should have gone to Spec......... etc, etc.
LMAOOOOO!!
LOL, it does my heart good to see such idiots out in the real world.  They should have a license plate camera, take a photo and then the police send you a driving suspension.  These kind of people need to be kept off the road.
IF I slow down I'll be shorter.  can't fix stupid
Wich is it eleven foot eight or twelve four ? The beginning of the video reads eleven eight but both signs read twelve four🤷‍♂️
It’s weird how the bridge is 11’ 8” but the sign says 12’ 4”.  Seems like they need a correct sign if they want this to stop happening.
We had a dump truck driver here a while ago that after unloading, went to get another load but forgot to lower his box. He was ' slightly' over height when he hit an overpass at highway speed.... LMAO.... Overpass 1 dump truck 0.
People honking: warning or cheering?
smash!
This is why insurance costs so much.
The sign at the foot of the bridge says twelve four on both sides of the bridge, so who’s fault is it, they put a yellow bar across the bridge that lowers the bridge but never changed the signs🤷‍♂️
I believe that this one was 12'3.8" before the stuff on the roof was added, which is another reason why TV aerials, satellite dishes etc should be removed when transporting the caravan.   The solar panel and the large thing on the back (AC?) were fine.
Bridge isn't high enough. I'll go anyways...dumb ass
I love these videos! Stupid is as stupid does!
It's hilarious as to how many dumb people there are in the world
So many stupid people on our planet
Why.  🤦  Why risk it???
It’s like when my dog tries to steal food from my plate. She figures if she goes really slow I won’t notice 🤣
Almost.
Put that 62IQ on the list
Drive by feel"
How stupid can you be? Like seriously
The overpass wins again
Can’t fix stupid
Going slower cures being too tall. Got it.
11'8" Bridge: Feed me A/C units!
Well, that went wonderfully smooth.
Oh that was too fast!  Go a little slower next time!
"Something's coming off on top honey." *KEEPS GOING FORWARD* "Well, we can't possibly back up now!"
How hard is it to know the height of your vehicle
That right there is the definition of a moron. A blinking sigh specifically talking to you and only you. And somehow you still do the dumb thing its warning against.
When I slow down my car doesnt shrink....Should I be worried?
I never knew how stupid people were until this channel came along.
This channel is evil (stupid). One time is a mistake; multiple times is YOUR mistake
Plot twist: the driver just wanted a simple, diy convertible camper trailer.
Wish I could say I felt bad for the guy 🤷‍♂️
When the piece fell off, that shit had me rollin
that coont honking his horn wasn't helping the situation any
Another dumb driver….
He should have driven slower
Amazing how stupid theses people are.
Why is the height bar before the bridge higher than the bridge itself?
If only they had some kind of warning
Haha
What’s the actual clearance?  The sign is confusing. 11-8+8. I read that as 11 feet.
What genius made the sign say “MUST TURN” instead of “DON’T ENTER!”
Just let the air out of your tires first, no problem
Hope they didn't need those A/C's.
Ohio plates lol!!
Unfortunately his "affordable" rv vacation just got way more spendy.
Looks like a haircut. "Just a little off the top".
When youre going through hell, keep going  - Winston Churchill
Why’s it’s called 11 foot 8 but it says the height is 12’ 4”
Camper: ouch, ouch, ouch Truck driver: made it!
What an idiot. The sign even read, "over height, must turn". And people honking at him didn't register either.
Hope it doesn't rain where ever they're heading to.
Probably needed new AC and had leaky roof and did it to collect on insurance. He obviously did this on purpose.
the city is only proving that they are beyond STUPID.  way way way past time to have a different warning method.  holy shit these videos go on and on and on and showing problems that require cops and clean up and traffic delays and detours.   what the fuk is wrong with the city/rr? do they only hire total idiots?!
Maybe they could change the sign to read: "Free Vehicle Shortening Device in Service.  Enter Here."
So I'll drive slower under this bridge which means it'll be fine...
Don't think your insurance is going to cover that
I like how he just keeps going. Like he's already made a mistake, so he may as well go all the way.
11'8" bridge yet signs say 12'4"?  I dont subscribe.. whats up ?
😆 What a tard, lol, too funny.
Just a little off the top
The lone piece that rolls off at 0:41 is text-book comedic timing 🙂
Where I used to work there was an underpass under a railroad, the clearance was 8 feet, we saw some crazy stuff.
It’s not a university, but the 11 ft 8 bridge always leaves the student with FACTS.
The lengths people go to to be on this is astounding. 😏
Hanging a pvc pipe from that stop light at the height of the bridge would solve all of this,
OTOH, next time he won't break anything.
Just a little off the top, thanks
The Boulevard of Broken Dreams… and broken trailer accessories……
Warning given but ignored. We can't help such people.
The scary part is these people are on the same Hwy as you.
They need a second pre-bridge 200 feet earlier that consists of a plastic pipe on a chain. If you hit that you must turn, I think working it will be pretty clear indicator.
If you go slow, it only gets mostly broken.
Didn’t know Biden had a motor home
"Hey honey, that there sign says we're coming into the town of Overheight.  Is that on the GPS?" 😆
With the amount of expenses that has gone into fixing problems this bridge has caused, they could have raised the clearance to the standard height of 14 feet 100x over. But people still think its the drivers fault for not doing calculations in their head to know if their vehicle is short enough to make it through. The city may not be liable for damage, but should try to do something to stop this seemingly daily occurrence from happening
Just goes to show that being wealthy is not synonymous with being intelligent.
YOU WATCH, PEOPLE!  A new "reality" show will spring up that just has lots of these clips edited to fit with a comedic narrator and a live-laugh virtual audience Zoom-ed a dozen random viewers at a time every ten seconds.  This is the state of America now.
Why don’t they install arms like at a rail road crossing that come down then someone over height tries to go under?
He was prolly the only guy to get off lightly. Others got way more damage
Turned a little too late there.
Well… the sign said “you must turn” and he did turn.
Was it really worth it? Impatient people no self control.
our educational system at work, many don't understand what the word "over height" means
Oops 🙊 ! From England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
crazy that when they designed this shit bridge they didn't make it higher than 14 foot the nation average
When I drive a big truck and come to a situation like this, I will come to a stop and put it in park and get out and look. Duh!
People just don't look at the blinking sign. It needs to be bigger with flashing lights that say DUMBASS
The RV owner was looking for a discount on a sunroof.
"Oh yeah. I totally saved us 3 minutes going this way."
These people in city hall need to be held responsible for damages
LOL😂
There's one from years ago on this channel. Same thing - camper trailer. Pickup truck driver doesn't even slow down. Rips the AC units clean off and is oblivious to it all. Keeps going.
i just done get it. i mean does there need to be fireworks or a fire breathing clown that comes out on top of the sign to make people see a flashing sign that says "overheight must turn"
Campers are the worst. A hazard to everyone on the road
At least they still have A/C
They should put up a arrow sign that says "Inspect damage here" on that side road where drivers turn after passing through.
Another Darwin Award winner! LOL
Going slower makes the trailer shrink just enough to make it through.  Oh wait...
Just goes to show you cant fix stupid
This is because in places like NYC they lie and make the heights slightly lower than they are. So people do not believe it.
To think. We share the road with this idiot
That looked expensive
He's thinking, "If I go really, really, slow - I'll make it"
The guy slows down before shaving off the top of his camper for the same reason I turn down my radio when I’ve missed my turn 🤣
These new RVs - last 25-30 years or so, are ridiculously tall.  Used to be they rode lower on lower frames, but the wheel wells would intrude into the interior space, (usually creatively hidden in cabinets or under a sofa), so they raised them. Also cheaper to build.
"Oh, I thought the flashing sign was telling me to turn AFTER I passed under the bridge."
They should have a $10000 fine everytime someone hits that bridge. They should make a sign that tells you this too. I'm sure this channel would no longer have content if they started doing that.
Whoop driver done an oppsie The 11 / 8 bridge claims another trophy Hehe Oh crap I's forgot about the aircon ducks on top
"The machine knows!" (Michael Scott)
I love how it was pooping parts all over the place afterwards.
Ouch. That one hurt. I don't mind seeing all the Ryder and Penske Trucks getting peeled back like sardine cans but man that's a nice camper. The driver only has themselves to blame but still.
Well! He never hit the bridge, the height bar knocked it down to size.
How come it says 12' 4?
So satisfying how he peels all the expensive stuff from his roof. Like removing the crust from a pimple. Amazing.
1 out of 4 air conditioners is better than none!
lol I love this channel.
want a lot of spare parts? Just move next to the bridge and drive near there!
imagine this happenning for 7 years
why dont they make a bump under the bridge to make the height lower to make it impossible for any kind of truck and bus to go ? truck and buses prohibited sign would sufice!! ?
It's short for "Overheight must turn away from all warnings."
i love the other cars honking and giving him shit
i can imagine the frustration the locals have with this lol
stupid
"Nailed it!"
I have to wonder if people would even listen if they added an audible signal that says, “Attention! Your vehicle is too tall to go under this bridge! Turn left or right now!”
idk why they dont just dig up the road and make it deeper
Nifty sheet metal work Jethro.
No fancy gub'ment sign gunna tellz me whut ta do!
Thought process:  "the time I'll save by going this shorter way is worth ripping off part of the roof"
"Why are they honking? Eh, I'll just keep going."
That's an expensive toll lmao
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Those drivers should know the maximum height of their own vehicle in imperial and metric, not in hunch system.
I miss the days when they'd get their entire air conditioning system swept off and they'd just keep going.
these people are so stupid!
"Overheight must turn" , Yellow shield with a clear height measurement, cars honking, sound of something getting destroyed on the roof.  I guess we'll keep on driving, sounds about right 😂😂
like how they honk
Ideas for the sign text - "YOU! over height, STOP!" or maybe spell it out in emojis for the new generation?  👇💥🤕
How obtuse can one be??? This guy is totally oblivious to the damages he has caused himself.
Trying to sneak up on it
I never get tired of the "maybe if I go slowly I can sneak past it" approach
I hope that was worth it.
Even with the flashing signs they still go, crazy
I think of this as a toll that people have to pay. It doesn't benefit anyone else, except for the pleasure in seeing stupid people get what's coming to them, and their reactions after.
Why would you KEEP going?!? The other people were even trying to earn them! 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
That put a damper on their vacation 😂
A lot of people measure their camper to the top, without taking in account of the vents and air conditioning units, if they measure it at all.
Why does the sign in the video say 12’ 4” if it’s 11’8”?
Was it worth it?
I’m guessing there is a photo eye that if it is broke for a period of time that it means don’t go. If a bird or something breaks it passing by well no problem. But a piece of equipment not moving as fast it will give a warning. I don’t know?
I love stupid peoples dedication!
hahahahahaha What a div
why cant they increase the depth below, in the road tat is,....
Incredible how your government still dont understand human behavior after dozens of years and think they put some signs somewhere and everyone will know how to react... This is not the fault of the people having accidents here, it is the fault of the designer of your roadways. Other countries get that. Americans seemingly not :D But hey its the land of the free... free of cognitive faculty I guess.
Honey the air conditioning isn't working can u go up and see what's wrong.
That camper cost more than my house. Those bikes on the back makes it perfectly dorky. Love to see videos like this. Instead of saving money they like people to know they make a good salary.  Way to go dorkenstein .
Going slow does not make you any shorter.
That guy probably went through and smiled thinking he was able to fit, his tactic of going slow worked only to find the top part of his camper missing, would love to see the roller coaster of emotion with that one
I like how multiple cars are honking and probably waving their hands wildly at the driver of the truck, who either never notices the horns blaring and never looks over, or did notice them and think the people were just waving and honking to be friendly and show their support for them being a mobile-home owner. I mean I figure in reality he probably knew that he was hitting it somewhat after a certain point and knew that trying to reverse might mess things up on top even more. However, that doesn't account for why he doesn't look to be trying to pull over anywhere to get out and pick up the broken stuff.
Yessss crushhh it!!!
I really really really wanted to see the aftermath. Did the guy get out of the truck to inspect the damage? Did he retrieve the pieces that fell off? Did he throw a tantrum? The world may never know....
Dumba$$
Just a little off. The top
He would have had to go 3 miles to a better bridge, so this was a time saver.
They need to add a sign that says, “going slow will not decrease your height…”
Made it!
He knew it wouldn't fit, but he kept going anyway.
*"OVERHEIGHT* *MUST TURN"*
I wish they would fine these idiots thousands. Does anyone know of charges stemming from hitting this?
It’s just such unique but yet short bridge many people think they have clearance when they don’t. Bottom line is if you’re driving a truck (uhaul) or even RV… know the clearance height between the roof of the vehicle and check the signs. Uhaul and most other rentals provide that when renting the vehicle.
The drax tactic. Moving so slowly the bridge won’t detect his equipment on top.
"Hmm, that warning MUST be for someone else, I'll just slow down a bit. What's the worst that could happen?"
"Just a bit off the top, please." 😆
Officer on scene :  "I think you need to calm down" Driver of RV         :  "How do you expect me to keep my cool when my AC unit is laying in the road!" I know, bad dad joke.
I will never understand the logic...
I hope the repairs were really expensive for the fool
despo running away from his girlfriend or wife
Mr. Trump fan said “no gubment is going to tell me I can’t drive there” and you know what, he was right. Way to stick it to the man, man!🤪
Hmmmm.. I think if I go slowly...
Maybe they need to install a barrier that swings down to block the vehicle?  Cuz apparently the Huge LED sign saying "STOP" isn't enougth.
Well, that was dumb
People are stupid. Raise the Bridge or lower the road. Start digging people
Will only cost a few thousand dollars to fix.
He fit under the bridge.  It was the lower warning bar that did the damage.
I'am Your Newest Subscriber Great Videos
Honey, the AC isn’t working…. Can you check it ? 😂
at least those items are the cheaper ones to replace on the rv roof.
Didn't need that
I wonder if the car repair dealers in the area are secretly paying off City officials to make sure they don't close it because it brings in lots of income to the Towing and Repair business's in the area!   It should have the name, "The Cash Cow" Bridge or "The Bridge that Keeps on Giving !!
This bridge has done more damage to vehicles than Russia has done to Ukraine! It's a pariah that needs to be destroyed and just start over again! It's cursed! OH THE HUMANITY !!!!
“If I go slow maybe I will fit”
Since the addition of this sign I have said it is not dummy proof enough.   It reads " OVERHEIGHT MUST TURN "  which many are interpreting as 'If your are overheight you must turn." (fortunately for us! ).  Adding some basic punctuation " OVERHEIGHT: MUST TURN! " might cause people to stop and realize it is saying "YOU are overheight: YOU must turn!".   Please do not encourage the engineers to add these changes, I love this channel too much!
So is it 11'8" or 12'4" ?
Stupid fucking hillbilly lol I love this!
Drive careful now Clark
He's no quitter! 👍
As we all know, if you drive very slowly that will lower the height of your vehicle .
The sign is too ambiguous. It can be interpreted as “anyone who is overheight” not “you are overheight”.   It should say TURN NOW OVERHEIGHT
Wow wow WOW HE just kept GOING!!
Resale value just went down.
borrowed camper. no, no i don't know how it got damaged.
All together now.... _Know the height of your frickin' trailer!_
Man that driver's an idiot and he kept going
Lower the road?
_Obviousy, if you sneak upon the bridge slowly enough, you will fit.
What i learned from this video is that moving slow shrinks things
Ignores flashing warning sign. Insurance no pay.
He made it but at what cost
"Generation DUMB"
Ahh that classic law of physics again: The slower you go, the shorter you get.
I almost thought this was the N Mechanic St Railroad Overpass in Jackson MI, but without all the graffiti LOL The city of Jackson is finally tearing it down because the same thing kept happening except with a 10 ft clearance 🤣
He is measuring the height of the bridge so next time he will be prepared for this
Do people not try to measure their vehicles? Like, big rig drivers should ABSOLUTELY know, but I feel like camper and truck rental people don't know they need to know
who did that ID ten tango think the OVERHEIGHT MUST TURN sign was flashing for? LITERALLY the only TALL vehicle around.. lmao
They could be more clear with their sighnage.
One
Shoulda let down his tires
Lol!  Even when there's a sign warning those too high..  they still go through 🤦. People are so stoopid
You need to have an audio speak for the blind drivers.  Something like... "RETARD! RETARD! TURN!"
What idiot spent money to install that big yellow bar and then made it 8 in taller than the bridge itself, it should be the same height so people don't hit the freaking bridge like it's not rocket science.
but why lower the actual height of the bridge by putting that yellow beam in front of it   so you spend the money to install a second lower beam?
That looked expensive
A small snack, a nibble if you will.
If you turn 8 on its side, it's actually infinity. 5 foot infinity. If only trucks could turn on their sides they'd fit. Take that physics.
Wow that dude was determined to make it thru no matter the cost and beeping of others!
Be vewy vewy quiet, go slow and you will avoid hitting the bridge! You just have to sneak under it!
I hope he like camping without AC.
So tempted to hire a really really high truck just for all the pleasure I know it will bring everyone on here.
This is what the YouTube algorithm was truly designed for.
"meh its under warranty"
Yeah just go slow and you'll make it every time 😂
Deflate your tires, jackazz, and you might have lost two rooftop air conditioners instead of all three! 😂 #PretzelLogic 🥨 🧠 😂
Just a little off the top 😂
I wonder if people realize that bridges like these were made this low to stop people from using public transport to get around and limit their movement, primarily black and poor people
I just realized this is in Durham, NC and I am 100% visiting that bridge when I move back to college 😂😂 just a quick drive away
He even slowed to read the flashing words. He wasn't a believer. He is now!
🤦‍♀️
Why would you keep going?
*Sign*: "Overheight Must Turn" *Driver*: "Liar!"
No big deal just ripped his whole hvac system clean off
if you go slower, the bridge isnt as tall.
It's just some extras
It’s well known that for every 5mph you go under the speed limit your height drops by 1”.
Maybe  they should consider raising the bridge hight instead of making videos of unsuspecting truck drivers.   It seems like the bridge engineers were trolling trucks drivers making it so low.
In between the "Overheight" and "Must Turn" part of the sign, should be 2 lines that reads: "Going to be famous on Youtube for the wrong reasons."
Just curious. Is the bridge really 11' 8" and not 12' 4" in the center? Just trying to understand the channel
Just a flesh wound
From the words of the Critical Drinker: nah, it'll be fine
Lol just found this channel 😄😄😄😄
So why is there is there 3 fucking signs that say 12-4.
I get a sickening amount of joy from seeing some rich old boomer cause thousands in damage to their rig
That was expensive
He made it!
For the idiot behind the wheel: No matter how slow you drive, you will still hit it!
camping trip ruined....unless they want to sleep with no A/C and bugs coming into their camper all night!🤣
JUST REMOVE THAT DAMN YELLOW BAR
“That sign can’t stop me because I can’t read!”
Either people are stubborn, can't read, or it's just both.
The thing about this is the warning system is it's completely abstract, many people aren't good with converting numbers or words into meaning quickly or at all. The system might seem fool proof but why don't they hang some chains for height so you hear it and feel it hit, or a big picture of an overhead crash, that would prevent most of these. Instead you have a giant steel beam and which has no forgiveness. For about 10 grand you could significantly reduce this problem, city needs to bite the bullet and just do a service to it's unaware drivers.
This one really made me laugh.  I mean what part of "OVERHEIGHT MUST TURN" and all the flashing lights didn't the driver understand? LOL
If you are already unsure, why keep going? lmao.
It’s funny how even the trucks were sounding horns to the vehicle
The shortcut was obviously worth it. Lol!
It's a good thing that RV driver slowed down, it made for a much better video!
Do they just not hear the crunching... or do they just figure there's no going back... if so that's commitment .
Maybe the driver didn't care bc understood his equipment was shitty old!
“Youth ages, immaturity is outgrown, ignorance can be educated, and drunkenness sobered, but stupid lasts forever.”  Aristophanes
He don't give a F...
How dumb can people get 🤣
Obviously hired.
Gotta love that he heard the initial crunch, and just kept on going!
i don’t understand why so many people keep trying. I drive big bodied i know what fits and what doesn’t.
You can’t fix stupid you can only hope it doesn’t kill you.
I love how often they slow down while going under. "If I'm not going fast then maybe I'll fit!"
Why does the sign say 12'-4"???
"I think we made it".
It's especially satisfying to see it happen to some rich jackass
You got to love it
I am so glad these idiots ruin their big stupid trailers
How about a big "NEON" sign on a swing down arm that drops infront of idiots like that person to physically stop them driving through if they're over height... mind you knowing how dumb someone like that is, they'd probably drive around it and keep going anyway...
Nailed it
pains me to see this one, but how much more warning can they give!
At least he didn't have to turn.
So sad to see as that might be someone who has invested their life savings in that vehicle, it would have certainly spoiled their day if not their holiday. Why on earth can’t the authorities do something about this it’s obviously very confusing and not working what’s in place at the moment. The authorities obviously know about this and they are a disgrace not doing anything about it.
What's really hilarious is how the guy continues to pull slowly forward despite the furious honking another driver was making. XD
será más barato arreglarlo...pero da más coraje
These are the middle-class winners of capitalism btw.
Nailed it.
The parking garage at the airport near me has a low ceiling. Before you can enter the garage, they have poles on both sides of the road with a piece of wood hung up by chains to the height of the garage ceiling attached to the poles. If your car hits the wood, you'll know it and realize your vehicle does not fit and the damage is none to minimal.   I wonder why they haven't done something like that with this bridge.
AND they honked at him...but hey, better finish what you started!...I guess
Maybe if you listed the bridge height in metres instead of these silly apostrophes then people might actually know how tall it is...
this happens only in United States, in other countries you have to read to obtain your license
Yes if I reduce the speed the damage will be negated, I am smart.
The bridge taketh and the bridge giveth
My hero
Who needs that stuff on top anyway.
You see the sign on top? "Overheight - must turn"? Well this driver thought it wasn't for him... Enjoy burning up in your camper because your A/C unit is ripped off and laying right there at that bridge...
I don't know why people even risk it. If there is a 5% chance your vehicle might not fix, take the extra time to just go around.
the bridge still hungers.
Haven’t been back here in eight months, and wow, four whole months without an accident, that must be a record!
Whats funny is every youtuber on here would try this if in a hurry . Its easy to laugh at someone else misfortune until you try it ;)
The stupidity of these people never cease to amaze me. I mean the dude perfectly knows by slowing down that he won't pass. He have the possibility and the obligation as the sign says to go around. But still he persist destroying his own vehicle totally aware that it won't pass anyway.
They could add as many signs as they want and people will still just send it.
omg wtf he went slow too like he knew and he was gonna stop
worth it!
That will all buff out.
"This one has decided to creep up on it. Let's see how that works for him."
Clearly, they must upgrade the sign  “YOUR VEHICLE IS TOO HIGH YOU MUST TURN YES, YOU, DUMBASS”
Bro it would be so embarrasing to be one of these drivers. Imagine everyone at that intersection just watching you take that L, especially when they're forced to back up 😭
Ok we are at the dessert lets get the ac going what honey its not working he goes what  do you mean its new of course it works what its not even turing on the kid says look at 11 foot 8 inch bridge YT channel a camper just like ours lost its ac units yeah right ours has 2 square windows in the back I will check oh oops yeah no ac we hit the bridge wife says no wander why people where honking at us and that was that scraping and crunching and banging noise we all heard well get the fans wife says you hit the bridge forget it we are going to a hotel we are not staying in this oven should have obeyed that height limit sign it is on says turn you turn not continue.
The sign is right in front of you how can one f this up so bad lol.
Well at least he made it through.
"Just a little off the top, please."
American
I love the thinking of “oh, this looks dangerous— maybe if I just go really slow, everything will be fine?”
I don’t know this bridge as I don’t live in the States .. but the sign flashes with a warning that your vehicle is too high … can you not see this sign .. is it hidden by the yellow marker??  Just saying …..
There is literally a sign saying overheight LOL
There goes the gas money.
I mean, technically they turned!
I know this is the 11-8 bridge, I have watched these videos humorously for years now. But I’m curious without trying to sound stupid but.. Why do the prewarning signs on the left and right say 12-4??
just install a laser detector witrh a loud warning signal..  cost: 100$?
Bridge really needs an ahooga horn too.
Don’t need that vent don’t need those ac unites don’t need the other vent
I can see the issue. The signs clearly say 12'-4" , yet apparently this bridge is only 11'-8". Someone messed up bad down at DOT.
Someone ought to do something about that.
It's a mother beautiful bridge : https://youtu.be/MJNpxvdqd_o?t=65
what a smart driver
slowing down wont make the bridge go higher
What does he want? Flashing lights saying " over height " oh wait it does. Lol
They thought they could be sneaky......HA!
The guy driving the 5th wheeler thought it was NOT HIGH ENOUGH, but once the pickup truck on the other lane honked he then knew he was ANOTHER can-opener victim...   RIP, AC units....
First time i see other drivers warn these f00ls
People like this should lose their driver's license for life.
11-8+8 bridge: overweight must turn Truck- how about nah *Cars honking* Truck- I said, how about NAH!
I dont get why he wanted to go through.
The other cars tried...I hope they were returning from their vacation and not going on their vacation. 😞
They need some sort of camera + AI showing the vehicle or the driver's face on a big screen.  Then maybe the driver will realise: "Uh, why are they recording me?"
Any chance the driver thought the shortcut was worth the damage?
I love how they just kept going 😂
"Maybe if I go very slowly the bridge won't see me."
Ah, glad you're back!
I love the way that driver stretched out the pleasure for us
every single one of these incidents could be avoided by simply getting out of vehicle and taking a peek at the clearance.
ah yes, the good old "if I sneak up on the bridge maybe it won't realse"
Stupid "Engineers" whom built this bridge.
I know the driver is a d!ckhead but they could make the electronic sign better, like STOP YOUR VEHICLE IS TOO HIGH FOR BRIDGE and make it flash red or something. Looks pretty benign as it is.
How hard would it be to have your passenger get out and ground guide you through?! They never do that, I don't get it!
You know driving slower doesn't make your vehicle any shorter
It's a well known fact that going slow will automatically lower your vehicle, thereby allowing you to pass under any bridge.
Gall durn gubberment bridge, don't you tell ME what to do!
People ignore signs. They think they are for someone else. They'd have to put the person's name on screen for it to even register and even then, they think it was another Bob. The piece that falls off at the end is gold. lol 0:48
I like how they think that going slow will make the bridge more passable.
He try to sneak under but you can't beat the bridge. 😂😂😂
The bridge that keeps on giving
i miss the old days where almost all of them got copletely pealed lol it doesn't happen very often now.
Flashing sign be like: facepalm and stops as drivers persists...
To be fair - its a newer RV, so those pieces were going to just fall off on their own at some point anyway.
what about removing 2 ft of asphalt from the road ?
What we have learned today: Diving very slowly dows not make you any lower.
Every now and then I'll look up this page when I need to laugh at someone's misfortune.
Hope he or she knows they Fucked up there camper lol 😂
Even with people actively trying to stop them, they still went for it. You can not fix stupid.
Another camper that has no AC, Lol.
I understand the diversion message, but it is curious to see Green lights accompanying the warning.  Here in UK, a low bridge in Hampshire shows carries red flashing lights when an overheight vehicle is detected.  Mind you, it still doesn't stop the occasional idiot from crashing!  If you regularly drive high vehicles, get a proper height stick.  The professionals all do.  Much cheaper than rebuilding or writing off your lorry, caravan or whatever!
He literally saw the flashing sign and still went for it.
I'm legit. That doesn't apply to me.
You heard and feel something crunching down but you keep going. What is wrong with these people. Nonetheless, a usual entertainment for us here
LOL,    too much money and no sense.
Don t understand that drivers. Drive 2 minutes morele with now damage . The horn had now effect too. There are so many stupid people in the world.
More aerodynamic now.
"Maybe if I go slower I'll get shorter"
Honey, why isn't the AC working?
If I go slow, the bridge won't notice me.
Lol all I can imagine is an old couple touring the US and running into this thing. "Frank I think you hit the bridge" Let me drive Barbara" "I know what I'm doing!" "But those people are honking Frank!"
The honking killed me! 🤣🤣
The bad news is they lost their air conditioning but the good news is the camper now fits under the bridge.
I’d pay good money for this bridge to be lowered back down
I bet everyone in the trailer sucked in their breath to try to make the trailer skinnier 😂
He’s like, “I’m good right!?!” Lmao
Im surprised that stuff like this still happens at this one bridge since forever ago
We have a new winner for the lowest bridge.  How about 1.7m (5'7").  They are building a new high speed rail line. It goes over a local  road. https://youtu.be/7vFoHoscphk
You spend that much money on a trailer yet are stupid to know how tall it is.
I’m someone who would never run into the can opener bridge. And it’s not because I’m superior to those who’ve run into it. It’s because I KNOW I’d be the one to run into it 😂 which is why I will never under any circumstances operate a truck or other large vehicle. I will literally pay for someone else to drive it if need be.
To me the ones where they go slowly under the bridge is worse than when they speed through. If they speed through, they probably forgot they were driving a tall vehicle in the first place. Going slow shows they knew their vehicle was too tall and STILL went through 😂
All these videos and no one knows how to estimate their cars' height lol
07JUN2022 - Install a hydraulic press above the crash bar. You hit it, it smashes your car.
My guess is that those drivers read the sign as "overweight - must run" and they think "I'm no fatso, you stupid bridge".
If only there was proper signage 🪧
Um...... you couldn't see the over height sign flashing ???
But why is the light green ? In my book green says go
Derp.
An RV without AC..    not cool....
Well….I see it’s STILL stupid is as stupid does it seems…..Despite all the people honking their horns as a warning too.
Going slowly minimizes the damage🤭
Can we re upload your videos?? Plz reply.
STUPIDITY never ending! Ya can't fix it, so laugh at it.
It is hilarious to me, not your content, but the fact that 14 years ago your cameras used to film this are still better than Walmart's present-day security cameras.
At one point it said 12’ +
jeez that was expensive $$$$
They at least should put a billboard sign a local insurance Company.  Lmfao
If these people rally don't want their A/C, rather than just destroying it they're more than welcome to just remove it and send it to me. I'll use it!
That one was far more satisfying than watching the working man ruin their big trucks...sorry.  Not sorry.
I can't believe how many years this has been going on. They just have to go that way and take the risk for no reason. They won't be detoured around. Their journey is too beyond important and every minute counts!
That’s hysterical.
That looks expensive.
At that Point... Mash the Gas Pedel and inspect damage later.
This is how you return a rental camper when you buy the extra insurance
You are looking at a big flashing sign that says TURN, but you decide, certainly that doesn’t apply to me.
It said he was to tall and to turn and he kept going. Give him credit he stuck to it.
He just spent 10 grand in 5 seconds!
No AC this weekend kids 🤣🤣
You mean to tell me we have self driving cars in our time that operate themselves yet the government tax money in funds of millions and millions of dollar can't have the consideration of innovation of engineering something to help the public in this situation.
Come to america.dont bother to learn english!!!!!we teach you the hard way pedro.
I think it's going to fit....
Just take a little off the top.
You should really put a camera to the other side of the bridge to catch their reactions.
DUUUUHHHH
What’s the last eight mean? 8/10 of an inch?
I don't get it. Why would someone risk it. They slow down because they see the risk, but go anyways.
I saved a guys ass last year .he was going thru a McDonald's drive thru just like that .I seen him and pulled off the road into McDonald's and ran up to him .I told him he was about to loose his shit .I helped him get everyone to back up and guided him out and he never said thank you 😔
"It'll be fine honey, the salesman said the caravan is 11'6" high."
wut
How tall is your trailer?  11’10.   Cool you can make it under 11’8 no problem at all.
I have to say their pain is self chosen. Approaching slowly and what stop traffic to back up, this bridge has and will continue eating the stupid
Don’t worry it’s OK they just will have to live without air-conditioning on this camping trip🤣
It will buff out
Being its a pos ford no trailer is safe 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Honey, we’ve made it!
It is a public cam or someone filming this? This has to be the luckiest place to be living in, it gives free content on a regular basis 😂
Over and over again-like a sitcom☺
Just take a little of the top.  That's all.  Trim it up a bit.  Looks good, thanks!
People are stupid
Democrat
Wow.  He never knew.  This overpass is famous.  Stay safe.  Always prepare for the unknown.  Come visit us.
If it is an 11 foot eight bridge they shouldn’t have signs up saying it’s 12’4”. So if the campers under 12’4” I would say it’s the cities fault for putting up the wrong signs.
A textbook example of stupidity.
Amazing
I hope that racist jerk didn’t want to use that air conditioner 😆
They just don’t believe what the flashing sign is telling them and simply carry on
They can put all the signs warning lights they want people will still be just as dumb
🤪❤️👍🙀
they forgot to hold their tongue right.
Dumbness just keeps getting better and better in this day and age couldnt you tell the height
I can't understand why they don't make it lower to 8 feet
That driver should’ve known better.
Looks like the driver could care less. He probably borrowed the trailer from someone.
Just like the Brandon Administration, it doesn't care. It just keeps on going and causing damage.
Camper owners... "how'd he not notice??" This is the first time he's ever considered the height of his vehicle.
They raised the bridge but can they also make a dip in the road a bit under the bridge? A little deeper road and the infamous bridge would be tamed finally. Oh well the videos are still hilarious
How about a sensor that drops a cross arm that prohibits forward movement ?  🚦🚧         🤔....?
$12,000 opps, those things on the top are about 6 grand a pop when damage is done like this.  usually it totals the camper.
Yeah yeah we know....who needs vent work
What a dip$hit
People can outsmart facts. Same with COVID pandemy.
They need to install an automatic gate that swings down like a railroad crossing, because no matter how big and clear you make the over height sign. People can’t read.
I told my wife for our honeymoon I want to set up lawn chairs next to the bridge and just wait.
Would insurance cover this claim knowing that there is warning devices in place and judging by the video of the driver stopping and then being like “screw it”
Many a trailer have been turned into a roof-less car by the mysterious bridge.
Slow peal
Another victim of stupidity and the bridge.🤣
and the mayor in that city didn't even budge to adjust the height of that bridge?
Could have jumped out and let air out of the tires... 🤣
The fact he keeps driving and peeling his RV open like a can of Tuna!!!😳🙄🤦‍♂️🤷‍♂️😂🤣😂🤣
If I sneak up on it real slowly, the bridge won't notice me.
He deserves that. I hope his insurance company sees this and denies his claim.
Driver obviously had no idea how tall their camper is
Oops, my trailer is too high.   I know! Slowing down will make it lower.
I know drivers are not observant and driving with care , but WTF do  the council not cut the road out and lower the road surface a little ? Surely cant be that hard or expensive.
So someone working for the town or state, gets access, gets paid, and gets those benefits to review these gems, then they post it and get paid on their YouTube channel? #brilliant
The Trailer Grater
kinda an absolute idiot for even trying, especially with an expensive camper, dont why why he'd risk it, I wouldn't
This reminds me of the channel that has a camera on parking spaces that have Private Property Towing Warning signs. Everyone thinks they are exempt.
If the bridge was just tall enough, this wouldn’t be a problem. American infrastructure is a D- at best.
Why didn’t they raise by 2’ instead of 8”?
Even with a sign flashing right in front of you ? Sure just keep going🤣🤣🤣🤣
The driver must need glasses because the sign told him to turn....
Clearly marked , maybe flashing lights w fog horns and Christmas lights . 😂
The Bridge God must be fed.
Hey Honey! Let’s take the camper to save money on hotel cost.
Looks like he just lost his vent covers - luckily a fairly easy fix. I thought he was gonna clip his AC unit but it cleared, barely 🥶
The road sign clearly says 12 foot  4
Wat am idiot
Why is there a 12'-4" sign in front of an 11'-8" bridge?  He still wouldn't have made it.
you would think the first thing a person would do after purchasing a big ass travel trailer or R.V. would measure its highest point. right after they go weigh it after loading it with all their have to have crap.
Some people just dont deserve good stuffs 😤
I bet any amount it’s some stubborn old man not listening to anyone else in the truck 😂🤣😂🤣
And for the next chapter...  The side street has apparently been permanently placed in 'on call' for the traffic light forcing nearly everyone to stop before going under the bridge.  <turn page 🤔>
I can hear it now... "Honey, the AC and satellite dish aren't working"... 😳... LoL
This is a famous bridge
Who in their right mind designs a low bridge knowing the standard size required
And a box of Crackerjaxx pays off again🤣
Good job https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCFX_Et2wrohZzDxG46Mmlsg/videos
Duh
"Hey babe, I've been watching this YouTube channel, and I know how we can get on a video."
🤣🤣🤣🤜🤛
You must pay the troll toll!
Why is there a sign that says 12 ' 4"?
Is the bridge miss marked or are people ignoring the signs?
I thought it was odd, it looked like they drove under the yellow bar with no issue.
Now he knows the camper is 11'10" lol I mean 12'6"
Don’t understand how people are willing to destroy their belongings instead of just going around.
🤣
Why risk thousands of dollars in damage?
It's a catch 22... Idiots like this are so entertaining yet so annoying... I guess it depends on my mood...
The bridge's apprentice snuck up and caught the innocent rv.
Camping is fun
I always imagine drivers who slow down also ducking their heads and sinking into their seat thinking it makes them low enough to get under the bridge.
Stop,check,deflate tyres,proceed-not so difficult
Know thy height.  Poor guy.  That sucks for him
he should have deflated the tyres
That many people hitted this 11.8ft bridge how isnt it scraped to 11.9ft already?
Im too fat to get out and check, so ill slowly crawl, thatll work !
Glad to see someone finally made it. Congrats champ!
A huevo que si paso...y pasó
They were clearly thinking of the height of their roof and forgot about some rather expensive stuff sticking up a bit. 🤦‍♀️😂
But why does it say 12'4" if it's 11'8"??
I think these people think the sign says,   "(IF YOU'RE) OVER HEIGHT, MUST TURN."   It should say, "STOP, You're OVERHEIGHT!"
Honey, turn up the radio. I love this guitar solo! 🎸🎶🎶🎵🎵
Lolol I held my breath 😳
So many people think they can pull a fifth wheel. As a truck driver I have seen many accidents…
He got through and didnt get stuck.
Deserves to lose his stuff for being that dumb.
Outstanding
Maybe they should lower the street
Wallet so big he just didn't give a fuck.
if only there was a digital system that knew how tall your vehicle was warned drivers on a flashing sign.. 🤔
and they say chem trails aint real..🤪🤦‍♂️
Is the height marking correct?  Or the problem is between the wheel and the chair?
Expensive mistake
I don't know about the rest of you, but I can not watch these without laughing or smiling!   I've done very dumb things too, but..........................
How clueless can you be. Big giant flashing sign telling you to turn and people beeping their horns but the genius is still like nah I got this.
guess that driver couldnt read english ... or didnt see the big 6x4 foot flashing sign telling him he was too tall ... or he didnt understand the words MUST TURN ... like the people who are told NO and then keep on doing what they were told not to get coonfused between the letter N and O
Know your height, when in doubt, turn off
What beats me is how many trucks from the same Company get shredded there.. And not just one! Do their drivers not talk or what 👀👀👀
Now you even get a big fat Text saying " ya shall not pass"... What else do y'all need to understand 🙄🙄🙄🤷‍♀️🤦‍♀️
Well at least he didn’t loose the ten minutes he would have lost to go around.🤪
Its says 12' 4".
_optional_ equipment as it turns out....
Since minimum vertical clearance should be  around fourteen feet I can only surmise this bridge hasn’t been raised solely for entertainment purposes. Well done city officials.
Hope you weren't going no where hot 😂😂😂🤣🤣😅🙄
Always know how tall you are.  I drove a truck from 1991 to 2018.  Trucks need 13 feet 6 inches vertical clearance and 8 feet 6 inches horizontal clearance.  What gets me is there are people who just can't see a vehicle with those dimensions in front of them.  I've been run into 3 times while legally parked in front of my house.  One left in the back of a police car and the other 2 filed suit.  The suits were dismissed.  The last one even wanted compensation for medical bills.  I gave copies of my pictures of him walking around uninjured and lifting a heavy case from the trunk of his car to my company's lawyer.  Plus when he left the scene it was in the car of someone he called on the phone not by ambulance.
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: “overheight must turn” is an ambiguous  statement. “You are overheight. Stop Now” or something along those lines would be better. “Overheight must turn” could be taken as a general statement.
dang, the over head sign even warned him!!! you would think everyone with high vehicles would know their exact height
Right now the entire country needs the 11'8 bridge
The sign read 12' 8''. If it's  wrong the city is liberal
Common since was to turn around
Well kids vacation is over time to go back home or have no ac
What a dumb ass fucking sign says turn .
Did he even stop
So
This never gets old 😍. Gift that keeps on giving.
Driver: Nailed it!
He wanted to damaging it slowly.
Just a little off the top sir?
The bridge even warned him he was too tall.
Why does he just keep going he could have atleast saved the rest
At least the a/c stayed
Who ever built that must be having a good laugh.
Like a boss😎
I'm sure those parts were optional 🤣
I mean was he right to keep going? Maybe he thought if he stopped he might get stuck.
They even have a blinking digital sign. What piece of Valhalla is on the other side of this bridge that keeps people driving into it.   It's like the harpes on the rocks
Oops.
Why would you keep driving? WHY!?
maybe the sign should say YOU ARE OVERHEIGHT with red flashers
Going slow doesn't help... But who needs air con anyway 😂😂
bridge is hungee :(
Oops!  😅
I would've been the dummy to read it as "those that are over height must turn"  Maybe "Too Tall. Turn now!"
Just a little off the top, crunch!
I can't back up the camper to save my ass.. Fock it
fuel prices are affecting the bridge's feeding schedule
They need to rise this bridge all the vehicles it torn up
Amazing, the logic of this driver, them rationalizing the decision to continue forward despite the blinking warning sign overhead. A subscription worthy channel indeed.
person in pickup truck honking: "hey asshole you're tearing off your roof ducts!" asshole: continues tearing off their roof ducts
Well.... he almost made it. Lol
APPARENTLY FORGOT TO ADD THE HEIGHT OF THE AIR VENTS
De-AC-ator
ouch!!
Oh, joy.
Pound of flesh
Explain that to the insurance company
I am delighted to learn that the truly Numb of Nutt do continue to mess up big time - this one partic. gratifying as driver approach guage with much caution as if to say "I know I'm too high  - I just know it!!" and guess what - he correct! He continue to bust up his possesion even tho' he know it - fabulous fun thank you so mch for helping to make day a Great one.  Ah the delights of schadenfreude - thank you thank you
Its almost like "I I go really slow and sneaky,,,The bridge will let me under".
That'll buff out.
You know, this (although clearly marked) has and is going to happen over, and over, and over again.  It now boils down to a city or county that refuses to deal or rectify a serious problem, once and for all.  These continued strikes against the rail bridge and rail bed are going to trigger a catastrophic derailment eventually.  I’ve seen similar issues like this fixed by lowering the road surface.  Doing nothing but cleaning up the aftermath and issuing a ticket, ain’t goin to cut it! 👎🏻
I think I can I think I can  I think I can.. I can't. 😂
It's gonna be a long summer! 🤣🤣🤣🤦‍♂️
How tall is your trailer? 11'7" before installing the max fans
So the way the system there works is. You drive up and sensors will pick up that you are too tall and switch the lights to red AND flash the warning "Overheight must turn" at you and then it eventually switches back to green, STILL FLASHING TEXT. So either you ignore the warning because you want to be on YouTube, or you are one of those people, that doesn't take ANYBODY'S advice, because you always know best....which makes you a moron.
More money than brains
Flashing lights and messages, bright yellow caution bar, other cars honking...still gonna see if it fits
I'm not going to lie I thought when they raised the bridge this would be the end of our entertainment. Fortunately they raised it just enough so everybody can still take a whack at it
I believe this was the same bridge that got my small camper....peeled off my AC all the plumbing vents and the exhaust fan ...all in all the damage was $5400 !! Thank God for insurance ...never thought the camper was that high !! 😂🤣
Kids, no ac in your camper this year.
11'8"+8"= ever vigilant...
Part off the roof: CLUNK!
Darn, that wasn't nearly as satisfying as seeing all of them get completely sheared off like they usually do.
When in doubt...stop!
I can’t get over how they just keep going as if it’s going to get better.  ?!?
I would have let the air out of the tires.
Reminds me of what Peter would always do in  Family guy !
🤣🤣🤣🤣
*11-8* ↕️ / Contraptions on top = 18 more inches > Owner ~ Hello Affleck Insurance
Well honey here we go and were off for that camping vacation of a lifetime
impatience many times supersedes common sense
It's because it starts of flat and goes uphill!
Why would going slower make it fit 😂😂😂
Is there anyway that you could setup another camera from the bridge area To The Street - Oncoming To the Bridge (so we can see that angle too ) 😁🙏🥰 please.
Keep a map and study the map.
The bridge must eat!
Well he is driving a dodge not very smart to begin with
Another 'had to get there in time for dinner.'
Just a little off the top…
I love how the sign says 12 foot 4 inches but it’s actually 11 feet 8 inches lol how is this not changed yet??
Na that's fine  . Flex seal to the rescue !
rip
Humans have a way of making everything a problem that doesn't have to be a problem. That this continues to happen at this and other bridges is comically ludicrous.
Question from UK. The flashing warning saying Overheight must turn, is this only an advisory waning and is always showing, or is it  only activated if maybe a camera, laser, detects an oncoming vehicle which exceeds the bridge height?
The dumber they are the more money they make. That’s the backwards reality I watch humans live in on a daily basis. Smh. I see it almost daily in aviation. So do the rescue personnel that have to scrape their non functioning burnt to a crisp brain cells out of the fuselage of their multimillion dollar aircraft. Smh.
Thanks I feel better about my day
This bridge remind me of so many in business management that think the computer security rules and policies - the bridge - don't apply to them.
That’s the largest can opener I’ve ever seen
Why don't they put a laser sight that activates hazard strobe lights somewhere on the bridge columns that get a driver's attention.
Why does people think going slow is gonna lower the height of their car/trailer? LOL
🤣🤣 can't stop laughing at the parts falling off all the way out 🤣🤣
Why put a sign at reads 11,8 but it short it's 11,7" 🚫 wrong Media news the city can not add up No!+:(:( The railroad and tracks are off so is the sign they can't read!+:(:(🏡🫖☕✌️☮️🇺🇳🇺🇸🌼🌼🤫🚫💌
Look's like he already knew he fudged it.
He's cool with that.
This reminds me of delusional republicans thinking that trump would evolve into a decent president. 🤔
Didn't really need all of these extra things anyway 😂😂😂
About 8k in A/C equipment
Honey I don't think it's gonna clear. JUST DRIVE FRANK IT WILL BE OKAY!! Okay dear...... FRANK YOURE AN IIDIOT!!!
More money than brains.
Why is that beam lower than the bridge?
Come on, please just make the road go over the train instead of under
Based upon the time stamp, it was just a quick snack for the bridge before lunch.
I had always wanted to retire at the beach and watch the waves, but now I'm thinking a porch, chair, and the 11 foot 8 bridge would do the trick.
That wasn’t bad at all
That’s a horrible feeling.
Wait.. there's even a sign up top flashing at him..  The driver... "they'll never know."
The bridge takes its toll on idiots. 💵💵
Why the 12’4” sign tho
There hay go
perhaps install an pre accident soft arch before the tracks so no one gets caught halfway across the tracks.
few inches  can be had, just deflate the tires a wee bit .lmao
that's going to cost....
Smart bridge.  Gave a warning to the stupid driver.
"overheight must turn"  Well, to be fair, they did turn...eventually 😂😂🤦‍♂🤦‍♂
you can't sneak past this bridge
Reverse! Reverse! 😂
I can't understand why a camper was downtown where that bridge is located.
It does say on the sign 12:4 correct
What kind of a imbasil  would keep going
The biggest problem with people and these shorter underpasses is people don't reconize before they go under them just what they are as a vehicle. Any big trucker knows whenever he goes underneith a underpass that he is a big vehicle and will check himself that he can clear that clearence every time he goes underneith the underpass no matter if he knows that he can make it or not. These people that are going underneither these underpasses clearly do not check themselves as what they truely are and hit the bridge pillar bc they forget what they are as a height standard. It's pretty embarrassing if you ask me.
Everyone is the exception
I remember old homeless Hank lived under that bridge he used to help people out and try to stop them before they drive under it and because you wanted to film it you had him harassed so much that he ended up leaving the area nobody knows what happened to Hank just so you could film this
This bridge is a public nuisance.
I see the can opener is still hungry 🤣  and it Looks like they added some new beams to it since last time I saw this
It has a bloody great sign flashing “Overheight Must Turn” but no, “I’ve got this!!”  🤣🤣😂😂
It’s about time.
🤣🤣the bridge always WIN!
It has something to with Einstein and relativity. The slower you go the smaller your trailer gets.😂
What i wanna know is, why the fuck is it marked 12'4"?
Fun fact: the drivers profession? He’s a mohel.
Barber : What’ll it be? Me : Just a little off the top
Signs work like they're supposed to only when you read them.  Otherwise, stupid and entertaining (for us) results occur.  Thank you!
the can opener strikes again !!
This channel is such a telling study of human behaviour ....
I love vehicles that choose to ignore the sign which says “Over height, must turn” & think if they go real slow, they’ll make it OK. It’s dangerous how many incredibly stupid drivers are out there.
Darwinism at work
While it would be expensive, I kinda want to see a Phantom camera set up near the bridge, to catch these crashes in amazing slow-mo. The Slow-Mo Guys did a video awhile back where they explored this a bit, but that was under controlled conditions.  Of course, the real issue here would be storage space for all the video footage. Phantom footage lasts for hours.
Driver's like "I'd rather just smash my AC unit than worry about backing this thing up in traffic"
“Honey,we got no AC now” -But hey,people were honking at me being all friendly and shit,nice folks around the bridge.
Maybe it is worth placing a large screen in front of the intersection, where a compilation of the moments of truck hits against the bridge protection would be displayed
Well I’ll be damned, driving slow yields no more success than driving fast 😮
Glad to see the bridge is still hungry 😅
I was waiting for so long, 5 months without a crash. The driver are getting smarter
Knocking all that off is alot cheaper than finding another route. 😆 know your hights and widths ppl.
I'd love to hear these people try to rationalize their decisions in an interview.
That was verry gentle.
C’mon man!! This joker has the truck for one about $50 grand, then the 5th wheel excursion module trailer. $38k? WTF? Now probably $8000 in A/C unit repair.
I’m glad after all these years people still come around and watch these videos. We’re like one big family.
If I drive really slow my overheight load will magically shrink. *Crunch* Or not.
the bridge's hunger is simply never satisfied
Oh my gosh!  This is my favorite channel ever and it took until now, May 15th, to pop up.  Maybe more views than you tube thought it could handle?  And I agree, this never gets old.
They need a railroad crossing arm *under* the bridge. Not a bad idea if I do say so myself.
I'll bet that owners manual in the glove box tells them it's just a bit higher than 12'4" .
Just keep your calm and move slowly, then the bridge will not bite. If it does anyway, it just wants to play!
when you notice something might not be right and dont follow common sense,,,expect to be honked at🤪
I guess the city thinks this funny.  Most areas would have a bar over the road way with chains before you get to the bridge. No doubt you should know your heights but maybe there should be a min. Height on bridges or lose federal money.
He couldn’t have had more warnings!
I swear one of these days someone will take a measuring stick to see if they can clear the bridge
Maaaaayyyyybe if I go real real slow, the bridge won't eat me.
Honestly they should put signs that hang down over the road several feet that's exactly the height of the bridge so when they drive to it it'll hit and you'll know hey stop stop that makes more sense to me!
Just a little snack.
STOP MORON. You could of saved yourself a lot of money in damages if you’d stopped BEFORE, & gotten out, & checked… That’s all good. This channel is one of my all time favorites for entertainment🥰…
Hey man, nice try
Hmmmmmmmm maybe if I approach it very slowly, the bridge will move for me!
Because if you go slower, you will not damage your vehicle 😅😅😅😅 seriously what is wrong with these people 🤷‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️
Omg.👏😂😂😂😂😂
This bridge is still taking scalps... When will they learn? SMH.
So how much will that cost to fix? Totally worth the few extra minutes to take a different route.
RIP air conditioner............
Perhaps at that point, the metric system should be adopted 🤭🤭🤭
Well….he’s not over height anymore…..
why did he slow down if he is going under it anyway and destroy his stuff ?
Why didn't she just stop and backup?
I love the way they just keep on going and they never stop
How can people be that stupid?! Wtf?! Is it really worth trying to sneak under this bridge? How far is it to go around? I mean really...maybe go five minutes out if your way and avoid damaging your vehicle! I just can't get over how dumb these drivers are! Incredibly dumb!
🤣🤣🤣🤣 The bridge was hungry again
Junk falling off as he slinks off in shame.
You almost need stop signs that fold DOWN off the can opener to stop these illiterate morons. But plus side we get more videos.
Bridge: (Crunch!)  Black knight Driving:  “Tis but a scratch. I will keep going!”
Why haven’t they change the sign??????
I like how people just keep going when they know they screwed up.  I guess they feel they don't have a choice if there's traffic behind them.
Going through slowly while being too tall is like eating just a little bit of nuts when you have a deadly nut allergy.
😂🤣
Couple pounds of air out of the tires and she'd have made it.
Why does the sign in the video say 12'4"?
Would have been so cheaper to just find a different route .Even though diesel is so expensive
Another trailer air condition deleted :D  I don't understand why this keeps happening again and again. This is the single most famous low bridge of the world. There's nobody who don't know it. Except for a few drivers.
At risk of sounding ignorant, is the bridge 11'8" or 12'4"?
It's shocking to see this still be a thing. It's like people are clueless to height restrictions...lol
some people ya just cant reach
If you have a large truck/trailer and the sign is telling you that your over height and must turn you should probably turn. That’s just me though
I wonder how many people have filed unsuccessful lawsuits against that town?  lol
He kept driving like "Wait, I'll keep on driving because I'm pretty sure I can get all of those pesky boxes on top knocked off" lol
In for a penny, in for a pound.
Ahh yes the “if i go slow enough maybe it wont notice me” trick
Yup, if I drive slowly, the bridge won’t even know I’m there…🤦🏼
Go slower and you will be lower - basic physics.
Schadenfreude at its finest!  Thank you!
"If I go real slow it will fit !"
Ah the old "Driving slower makes you shorter" technique.
The warning needs to more directly state "YOU ARE OVERHEIGHT" otherwise it just seems like a general alert for over height vehicles. That's the only excuse I can give for people still ignoring the warning.
Who needs an AC unit on their Trailer anyway?
Peeling it softly....
"If I go slow, it probably won't break anything"
As Ron White famously riffed.  “You can’t fix stupid”.
He was not good at reversing trailers anyway. So he had to sacrifice some equipment.
Can’t fix stupid!
This reminds me of SpongeBob parking that ghost ship
These people: Travel trailer for sale!     Buyer: why you selling?   These people: oh everythings great we just did lots of traveling and we're ready for something else.
If the bridge hadn't been raised, it would have totaled that camper. I bet he'd have a hard time getting insurance to pay due to all the warning signs.
What gets me is they know they hit it, but they keep on going.
He wasn't stealthy enough.
Welcome back yall
if you like watching dummies do dummy things you might wanna search for Rufford Ford here on YT as well ... have fun!
The sign says 12 foot four not 11 foot eight.
your right it gift that keeps on giving ,
He just gave up once he heard the crunching and scratching. He knew it was a possibility. I would want to interview the drivers to see what they were thinking.
No offense but you must be a complete idiot to drive further after a lot of warnings and the sound of the things on your roof breaking... Actually, it is ok to be offended, I'm sure the bridge is offended too!
Are people out there really that stupid?.
Bridges gotta eat too ya know..
How dumb is he or here!👿
Each video is like an early christmas present, thank you.
BROTHER,  THANK YOU.  I LOVE THIS BRIDGE.
it even shows it that he is too high.. some have the IQ of a plant
Ahhhh, the go slow approach, that always works.
Listen. Understand. That the bridge is out there. It can't be reasoned with, it can't be bargained with...it doesn't feel pity of remorse or fear...and it absolutely will not stop. Ever.
Yes, that can through cold water on a weekend camping trip. The driver probably had to pull over and vomit.
Almost 200k worth of truck and camper there. All that money with no common sense.
ada lagi yang langgar🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Well at least the solar panel survived
I really wanted to see it peel like a sardine can. 😂
That guy is at least 12' at the top of his air conditioner. But the bridge was eating his Fantastic Fan vents too (very close to the roof). They're not nearly as fantastic now.
Jesse we need to get a car that fits under the height limit of this bridge jesse
This is one of the best of all.  Usually it's about obliviousness.  This is willful ignorance.
Not a problem for people with more money than brains.
How many channels can post this same video, holy Sh**
I was going to give them some credit for not actually knocking anything to the ground, but there it was at the end!
He's an idiot  https://youtu.be/yau7Z3vMBo0
Hope insurance doesnt cover that morons actions
Slow and sensual, just the way I like it :)
What a smartie !
Optional insurance on the camper rental? Nah, it'll be fine...
This makes my day every time!
a guy or a gal with no brain driving a 5th wheel, very scary to know those stupid people are in the road...
Classic! It's the "go slow, and take our time cautiously ripping it off the top"
Man, good job !
Bridge 1, Camper 0.
Driver: How did I get all this damage?  I did turn left, right AFTER I went under that bridge.
Is it just me or was there 12.4' signs there??
A light snack for our girl. An expensive repair for the dopey driver who ignored the over height warning.
idioten. wisst ihr nicht wie hoch eure Fahrzeuge sind? wir haben einen kfz schein. höhe breite gewicht zuladung. nur doof.😅😅😅😅
honestly how stupid can people be even when theres an automated sign which tells u to turn around because your over the height they still gotta do it. 🤣
Basic Mathematics is Key! Heck, reading skills too... You've got to know your limitations 😁
Welp, no more AC
Fortunately it looks like nothing major was damaged. 2 vent covers (probably something the owner installed or had installed) and the TV antenna. It barely clipped the A.C. but it doesn't look like it was damaged. Shouldn't be more than a few hundred dollars. Hope he learned his lesson.
Dude got lucky looks like his ac units were just slim enough to not get taken out, but his roof vents took the damage and looks like a sattelite reciever  as well
I have to see the comments on this
Never gets old 🤣
Yeaaasssss
Ah, how I've missed these videos.
If there is doubt, JUST GO AROUND! ... people.
Its been a while but the bridge just wanted a RV nibble this time :-D
"Why are they beeping, honey?" "Oh, it's probably that they're cheering us on. I'll just keep going."
What did he lose?  Vents?  A/C?  Aside from that probably created a permanent leakage problem on that fancy RV LOL.
exhaust fans and vents removed but lucky for them the a/c unit survived I would guess its going to get expensive at any rate.
Why do
Slow and steady wins the crunch!!
They raised the bridge and the idiots are still hitting it.  Barry
Lol   driver: “hmm let me creep slowly see if I can squeeze in”     Can opener: sorry bud it’s just a close shave!!!
Why does it day 12 ft 4 though?
How stupid do you have to be to do this?
Glorious!!! ❤️🥰 warms me heart!
I don't have to stop. My inability to obey road signage will save me.
I love how the guy realizes he might be too high for the bridge and then decides to go slower as if that will make his camper shorter.
Упрямый малый. Молодец!
The feels when this driver has clearly measured his camper from roof to ground, knows it should fit, and forgets that there's stuff on top too 😂
There's a bridge here in Muizenberg,Cape Town,South Africa that has on average one incident like this every 2-3 months.They nicknamed it Bridgette. 😆
I love it how all the cars are telling them to stop
Some people are simply thick beyond belief.
Just keep on trucking
bridge spits out - yes, another one! made it!
This is another example of "you can't help stupid people".
This is Fate telling you that you make too much money.....lol.....
Enjoy your camping trip.. in a box.. with no ac 🤣
Well when people try to honk to stop you and you still don't give a dang, and you still just drive on. Then your so thick in the head that you deserve the cost of the repair.
Stupid is as stupid does
Pity they didn't slow down enough earlier so they could read the "Over Height Vehicle Must Turn" sign.
lol, if you go slowly your roof gets lower, I love it
Please bring back the second camera! Second Camera, what happened to you? 😢
And with that I drift off into deep sweet sleep
Hi again, Bridge, it's been a while. Love watching the destruction! Can't they read the board above the road? LOL
Wouldn't it solver everything if they were to just remove that yellow bar or just make it as high as the bottom of the bridge instead of extending further down to make sure no one can get past
Damn, screwed his RV up!!
Gotta love this machine eating bridge's insatiable appetite !
I forgot about this channel and YouTube remind me that the bridge won again.
amazing how stupid people are that slowing down will change their height
Keep on truckin !!
The fact he kept going after obviously feeling the damage. Cringe. He got what he deserves
I'm like the camper guy. I thought the bar was the same height as the bridge, and if you cleared the bar you would clear the bridge. Who put it higher?  That's dumb.
I’m beginning to think that they don’t WANT to fix the bridge! It’s too much fun!
I guess I missed the sign that said "Overheight.  You'll probably be fine if you go slow"
Maybe he never liked those things sticking out the top of his camper anyway.
If I go slow the law of physics cant harm the roof.
It just proves the old saying: the slower you go the shorter you get.
Going slower causes less damage…
Yet some still don't learn.
What city is that looks like S'Port La.
The comments are the icing on the busted cake.  lol
That camper roof will never seal up again, will be completely moldy and rotten next year. Nice.
The guy is both rich and an idiot.  He didn't care.
And the winner is. . .  The 1987 Volvo Wagon that has been in over 40 videos
More money than brains.
It doesn't matter the bank owns the camper anyways
Don't point that gun at your balls! Why are you pointing the gun at your balls? BOOM.
3 out of 4 aint bad
They should have lowered bridge instead of raising it so that nobody can even dare to pass that bridge at all. Very core rule of the traffic: if you make road easier to use, you get more problem instead of improvement.
Yep, that camper trailer was to high to clear the bridge and the driver ignored the flashing warning sign. By driving slowly towards the bridge, did not limit the rooftop damage to his nice camper trailer. The bridge gave this camper a very expensive haircut. What an idiot.
So much better to take the damage, than stop, get out, and have a look.  I mean - that would would be embarrassing
There’s a low bridge train trestle in our city nicknamed “the can opener”. The city busses just barely fit under it. I can’t say that the bridge always wins because an all steel mobile crane rammed it. A big I-beam was dislodged from it’s supports and the bridge was out of action for a few weeks. I didn’t see any damage to the crane.
God I love that sign.
EVEN THE FLASHING WARNING DOESN'T DETER THEM !!!
The funny thing is, if the front of the trailer wasnt too high because he hooked it directly to his bumper like a dumbass rather than using a load leveler like he should have... he might've cleared.  By inches, but he might have.
Por que eles até hoje não rebaixou o piso??? Depois chamam o terceiro mundo de ignorantes 🤦‍♂️
Must have been a Karen driving.  Slow down to read the sign that is flashing, "Over Height Must Turn"  Entitled Karen says "You can't tell me what to do"   I'm happy that the bridge still gets its victims
The amount of stupidity is no longer shocking
Well, he made it. Most of it made it anyway...
thank you
MaYbE iF I gO REAL Sloooooooow, the damage won’t be as bad.  Love to see the insurance claim paperwork
They should've lowered the bridge.
The legend will not give up. Amazing show for Darwin
Love watching this - been doing so for a few years now. cheers from Australia 👍
At least he only lost the vent covers and wifi antennas. AC units looked to squeak by haha
“Oh shit, I fit! That sign is TOTALLY WRONG!” 👍🏼
LOL, it wasn't removed, that guy removed it on purpose. He KNEW he was going to hit the bridge. Looks like raising the bridge was a waste of time and money...
"Here in the wilds of Durham, we see a Canicus Openus waking from it's Winter slumber. Fortunately for the hungry bridge a RV (Really Vapid motorist) gets a bit too close and the Canicus Openus manages to get a few quick bites in before the RV escapes. With the advent of migrating season for the DURR herds, we can expect to see lots more action from this apex predator."
"SLOW DOWN TO FIT TRAILER" was the sign that flashed.
I wonder if the cost to repair his camper was worth the time he saved
Ahh i missed this one
Tesla cyber tuck with camper hooked up to it will automatically avoid this bridge on auto pilot mode
they need to install more bigger warning signs and flashing lights and loud sirens.
The guy in the black pickup blowing the horn at the other pickup pulling the trailer. Yes, the guy knows he's an idiot, you blowing the horn is not going to suddenly make the trailer fit underneath the bridge unscathed.
Slow down, you can trick the bridge.
What amazes me is that, even though you can hear the thing tearing up and surrounding vehicles honking at him, the guy just keeps on going.
Not too bad
Dumb de dumb dumb.
Why is it 11'8" if the sign says 12'4"
He had a feeling he wasn't going to make it ... it was an "Aw Fuck it" moment.
I didn't know that Joe Biden drove a 5th wheel?
The ones that honked must know about this channel.
Alex Jones was right about Klaus Schwab and his Great Reset
Poor guy thought he made it. 🤣
Firstly, know your rigs height before you start driving and pay attention to the signs. Especially the flashing ones!
The yellow bar before the bridge is to high he when under it but hit the bridge. I thought the yellow bar was to protect the bridge?
Subbed
April crashes bring May gashes
If I go real slow, maybe I’ll fit under…oh wait, I’m an idiot.
I guess he thought if he went slow it would be ok.
One of the things you as a camper owner should always keep in mind is how high the camper is. It's common sense. Apparently, this person lacks this.
my camper will take the stress out of my life.
You just can't argue with a bridge.
And that moron is driving on the roads with the rest of us, scary.
God I love this channel.
Going slower does NOT make you shorter…..just dumber.
Finally! You upgraded the camera to 1080p lol
That's great audio
I like how he thinks if he sneaks up on it it won't rip off his AC unit! 🤣
About a few hundred dollars there
Oh sweet can opener bridge, how we have missed thee!
I hope the insurance says, this repair is all in your wallet.
Dumb adze.
I wonder how many of the people who got bit by the 11' 8+8 bridge have ever watched it on YouTube, before or after?
This bridge needs to be fixed.  I know they did some work on it, but they need to close down this intersection until they fix it.  Millions of dollars in damages are caused every year at this underpass.
Stupid people keep other employed
I'm sure he said f*cked it the damage is done lets keep going on.
"I'll take Expensive Mistakes for $10,000, Alex."
Because when you slow down trailers pass right through metal girders.
Which part of the "overheight, must turn" didn't he understand?
Just 15-20k in damage,no biggie!
Need change the words on sign LOOK D ASS YOU'RE TO TALL TURN LEFT NOW!
They get what they earned. If in doubt go another way. He was in doubt and did it anyway.
Blame GPS.  People don't know how to plan a route or watch for signs any more.
What do you get when you cross 11ft 8 with a 12 ft 5th wheel? Extra parts.
Google's GPS elevation map at work. "Duck in 100ft"
He was applying that new woke math when he measured it's hight.
ρяσмσѕм
😂😂😂😂😂👍
Driver said he really doesn't care, camper was a rental.
Hope that RV is insured…..
Absolutely amazing to witness pure stupidity. You approach super slow in case it hits all while ignoring the HUGE blinking sign telling you that you are over height as if hitting slow will be better than fast. Then you hit while people do everything possible to stop you and ignore all this too and keep on going. All of this so as to avoid the inconvenience of going around. Sure hope the expense of obliterating your RV's functionality was worth the time saved.
Idiots are Sooooo entertaining, yet EXPENSIVE
What a stupid driver stupid stupid dummy,the sign is flashing “over height” and he continues even though he’s crunching away at the roofs air-conditioning unit and other things on the roof ,so stupid not to stop and back up …..what is wrong with this guy he is the kind of driver that’s on the road today pretty scary
I just don’t understand. That big flashing sign that says over height must turn must be wrong. Maybe if I drive slow I can sneak up on the bridge and make it thru 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂.
Not sure where this is but I don't want to live in that part of the country.  They have idiots working for the highway department.
He knew it was going to hit but drove under it anyway.  My mind boggles.
I swear I saw the bridge lower itself . . . and chuckle
I miss the days of a new video every week. Come on idiots, step up your game!
It's a whole kind of special stupid to not know the height of your camper!
Myślał, że jak zwolni to przyczepa się skurczy? xd
Slowing down was the exact opposite of what this driver should have done. If they'd sped up to [scribbles quick calculation on napkin] 168 MPH, it would have created sufficient downforce on the trailer to clear the bridge. 😆
Two signs with the height of the bridge, a yellow bar at the bottom of the span, a FLASHING SIGN...The  conclusion:  Oh yeah, I can make it.  🙄
If in doubt just turn and be on the save side.
I love it when they juuuust scrape off the dishes or AC unit.
Ah yes, the  "I'm too dumb to realize I'll cause thousands of dollars of damage regardless of my speed" bridge approach.
They were literally warning him. Damage would’ve been very minimal if he stopped when he heard the horn, no?
long time no see. Greetings
Special roof clearing operation, success level - 100%
When saving 5 minutes is worth about $5,000
I was lookin at the trailer shadow and it all looked fine and my wife had to pee.
Nice!
Good thing the ladder didn't hit the bridge. Ladders are the most expensive rooftop accessories 🤣😂🤣😂
People slowing down to make the bridge are much like those who talk louder so people who don’t speak English can understand them better.
But the GPS said go straight!!!!!!
I like how the signboard gives up at 0:22 about warning.
A few months of peace at the bridge but it seems that now the bad drivers are back in action. 😏
Overheight , must turn !  " Duh , ok , I'll turn as soon as I get under this bridge"
*Can they put a camera on the other side of the bridge?*
maybe the yellow bar could be further out from the bridge or even better lower the rd
Must be just south of Chicago
No comment.
If only they had gone a little slower they would have made it. Not quite slow enough. Everyone knows that the slower you go, the lower your vehicle gets. They just went 4 or 5 inches too fast.
He eased through there, we all know the safest way to get under that is to gun it full throttle.
But the bikes are okay
take they never read the high bar some people are the same here in the uk....
The driver doesn't care because the weight savings will increase his MPG .........
He did it so gently though!
Zombies behind the wheel.....please disregard the flashing sign directly in front of you
According to Einstein’s Theory of Relativity, if you travel at a speed approaching the speed of light, your dimensions shrink or something and you would pass safely under this bridge, so obviously, going slow was the wrong strategy!
People are costly damages to their own vehicles when they can just take a couple minutes to go down another road instead  lol
'Deliver this caravan'   ''Ok....nothin' about 'intact' ''
The driver already knew he couldn't back up a trailer for shit & he also knew he sucks at making turns...So he just figured the risk of damage overhead was better than the embarrassment of side-swiping a pole or car while turning. I'm sure by now he's rethinking his new strategy for next time...He probably also believes that Joe Biden is an excellent president.
The US is like a third world country on basic infrastructure
The sleeping dragon awakens
Oh look an 'Overheight must turn' sign flashing away to alert me of impending danger.What is my best course of action here? Why of course I'm special so it doesn't apply to me! Full steam ahead!
Babe wake up new 11 foot 8 crash dropped
ONCE AGAIN LIKE SO MANY OTHER TIMES!!!!!!!! Instead getting out and checking I'm going to go real slow at this bridge everyone knows about and if something starts to break I might stop..........
Dumb as a bag of hammers .
to much money, not enough brains.
At 0:28  he's probably thinking "Who are they honking at?"
"11' 8"... 11' 10" aaaah, what's the difference? "   Most expensive 2 inches he ever paid for.
If the sensor computes that the coming object is too high, an obstruction such as a metal chain screen should drop down, preventing the truck from going forward.
If the roads authority added placed drawing showing vehicle height INCLUDING roof mounted accessories, I reckon that would help. Also, even though the warning sign flashes, the green go light could confuse the interpretation of what to do (ie, one sign says turn, the other says go ahead).
They never learn what "You can't clear" means.....
Who the fuck drives around with a big caravan like that,something I’ll never do
I've driven trucks over 43 years and I never understood people like this,if your not sure dont go slowing down it's going to shrink it ,know your height
Why didn’t the driver just turn down the street  park up somewhere and access the situation,patience is a virtue and ‘gold’ folks.
"see honey, i told ya we would fit, had inches to spare"
If I was that driver and I heard the first crunch I would of stopped and put it in reverse and turned on the side street to take a different route.
He know it and he still did it 😂
Where the yellow bar is, they need a ramp, that pushes the vehicle down to the correct height, instead of clipping it. Compress, dont cut....
Such natural comedy!  The way the last couple of pieces fall off as the truck turns, like the last couple of Tribbles dropping... adding more insult to the whole scene!
See I told you honey look at that we made it just fine
Has anyone opened an engineering and welding shop on the other side of that bridge yet?
It's OK.  He took it all off ....  gently.
Nice costly repair bill resulting from complete ignorance
When 12' 4" identifies as 11' 8"...
it's a good thing that hero was there to honk his horn.
That was an hors d'oeuvre for the bridge.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN THIS ISNT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY!!! 1 STAR
Obviously running late to his MENSA meeting!
it's a Foot Bridge, A Foot to low, lol
It takes a special kind of stupid to hear shit breaking and falling off and still keep going.
Heartbreak Bridge
When "RV" stands for "ruined vacation". Seriously though, why would you try and keep driving?
hey the A/c doesnt work
How come no one puts one up across the street at 12’ with hanging cans at 11’8 to make noise and alert
Lol 😂
Any RV trailer over 11' 6" in height traveling Interstate is ILLEGAL!!! Read the DOT regulations. It's there in B&W print in LARGE LETTERS. Along with "It shall not exceed 84" in Width and 63 feet 4 inches in combined tow vehicle and trailer Length if a Fifth Wheel design. " And the specs for a bumper trailer and tow vehicle, and MANY are illegal. There are also WEIGHT limits per axle and in total. Just because an RV dealer SELLS it doesn't make it LEGAL! I've been RVing for more years than many of the GreenHorns have been alive and seen them SEIZED at Colo. Ports of Entry-Thank God for everyone Else on the road!!! I was on my motorcycle headed to Yellowstone (tent camping) and saw an overloaded station wagon with a bad hitch/trailer lose it on a mountain with 5 kids.
I do feel a little sorry for this person. In Australia we often have warning bars (the horizontal yellow bar in front of the bridge), the same height as the bridge and the bar is suspended by chains. So, if the top of your vehicle hits the yellow bar (with minimal damage, as the bar swings) you're given a warning and a clear indication that your vehicle is NOT going to fit under the bridge. Also it saves the inconvenience and embarrassment of having your vehicle extracted from under the bridge. This warning bar seems to higher than the bridge clearance - perhaps lulling the driver into the false belief that the caravan would make it through unscathed.
Imagine pulling up to your holiday spot:- it's either blazing hot or freezing cold and you go to bed and it's raining too. You didn't think you bought it with a sky view. It lets the mosquitoes in for a feed. If it's a cast roof as they are now, you've got much expense- the framework's damaged- but cast, the wirings ripped and torn out, your vents similarly have damage. Your lighting no longer works. All for "trying to make it." It's a win win, like 'those' bosses say?
Bridge: ....Ooh a CAMPER dang I am HUNGRY!  ....He's going slow and I'm licking my chops! Ah! NOM NOM NOM.....air conditioner.....NOM NOM......very tasty!
Doesnt do much good if you cant read and even if you can you dont stop, smh.
It always looks like its going to fit until it doesn't.
What's astounding is the logic that it's better to smash everything and have a fuckedupday, than it is to make sure and at the worst of a good day- back up from impending stupidity?
Obviously insurance fraud.  Anyone who failed to follow the directions on the flashing sign saying you’re going to hit the bridge, was trying to hit the bridge.
always know the height of your trailer or truck
I like how he thought he’d be ok as long as he went slow
Have to laugh. Stupidity has no barriers.
Maybe if I pull off the band aid really slowly it won't hurt as much.
as you will found out the hard way   that the bridge has won every encounter its put up against
If I go slow...
step 1: deflate tires to 1 psi to gain enough clearance
hard to fix stupid
How many idiots in this world 😄😆
That worked out well!  Not!!
He/she driving says " WTF l'll carry on anyway ! Let the bridge do it's worst ! Hey what old boy !? "
You can't fix stupid!
They should at least have a sign that warns people.
Murica lol, what a bunch of gonads.
is that thing talking to me?! Nah, it can't be me, must be broke or something...
They're lucky it was only vents and the air conditioner cleared.
Right in the hip pocket.OUCH!
Beautiful blue sky, nice day for appetizers.
You know these geniuses will be most upset about the TV antenna, it’s not hot enough for AC yet.
And it was once shorter. I guess people get dumber.
Why? Those things are not cheap. I just cannot fathom why they didn't stop, where they like "oh well we've already done a little damage so I might as well keep going."???
“No problem, we’re headed north. We won’t be needing the AC any more this year”
Some people are so committed.
Gotta deflate those tires, get that extra inch. Besides, who needs a cell booster anyway?
How does someone who clearly can't read obtain a driver's license? O_o
"I Must Turn? Surely, right after the bridge" 🤦‍♂️
So it says 12 4 buts really 11 8?
Even the guy in the ram blowing the horn wasn't enough to stop him once again proving that P.T. Barnum was right.
The guy honking: "KEEP * GO * ING" "PLEAZ DON'T STOP"
'Stupid is what stupid does'
Pro Tip:  Going slower doesn't change the height of your vehicle... it just makes the crunching sounds last longer.....  🥴🥴
Ya but he saved 5 minutes
This wouldn't be nearly as funny w/o the flashing sign.
They have no idea how tall their vehicles are, but they are convinced that they aren't that tall!
I used to feel bad when I watched these, but...
I think the idiots who keep ignoring the signs, pushing their luck, and hit this bridge should be responsible for paying for the cleanup.
Fits now……..
He even did it in slow mo for us.  How kind!
Why not just go around?
Tire spikes should be installed that pop up if your oversize. That should give you the extra clearance  needed.
People literally think the sign is a lie.
Seriously, how do people keep hitting the bridge?  It's well-marked, the traffic lights automatically switch to red when there's a too-tall vehicle detected, and there's a flashing sign.
Awesome. tough guy thought he could make it.
His fatal mistake was not letting most of the air out of his tires first !
This would be a great location to start a truck/camper roof repair store.
Always satisfying.
They need to put a flashing sign at eye level height.
OVERHEIGHT MUST TURN
It's always funny when people try and "sneak up" on the bridge. Like, what difference is that going to make?
11-8 is the IQ of the cretins who hit it.
Curious he was well below the yellow clearance beam (that's supposed to protect the bridge) but still hit the bridge.
clean operator
"I think we made it!"
Loving it , plenty money and no idea .
So, 11’-8.5” ac unit? Almost made it.
Can’t stop halfway through. At that point what difference does it make
Going slow doesnt make you shorter. I think we need more bridges like this in the county. You hit em and you lose your license. Lol
They should just put a siren there that would get activated by contact with the bar.
It is like the driver read the height of the tailer in the manual, but neglected to account for the extra height of the aftermarket air conditioners. Perhaps they thought the wiring was slightly wrong.
I love how this channel is all about accidents at this one bridge. You may think there are few uploads, but no.
That wasn't so bad, but I'll take it. Where are the careless drivers? I want destruction.
They should put up a giant picture of like a vehicle with its top split open on this bridge.
50 years ago I worked in a building near one of these low bridges. There was a light beam across the road that set off flashing lights and loud horns. I guess some towns are slow to embrace any sort of progress!!!
I mean, it’s only a stupid bridge right?
If it were me and everyone was honking I’d probably stop and look it’s baffling why they proceeded
What is going on inside their heads?. "Oh yeah, look at the funny big flashing textmessage. Let's ignore it because it's not flashing, it flickers. Definitely broken" (crunchy trailer noises)...
t-shirts need to be made "I didn't survive 11'-8" ".🤣
It was close. I would have deflated the tires on the camper, perhaps that might have worked.
WHO NEEDS AIRCON
I just bought a used RV. This hurts. Although my rear A/C doesn't work anyway.😁
" Overheight must turn "  what part didn't the driver understand ?
OVERHEIGHT MUST TURN.... how hard is that to read?
At this point I think people do it just for the notoriety... need to make a shirt “ I smashed my shit at the 11’8” bridge and on the back I’m stupid
Someone should invent a system that could tell a driver they are too tall and warn them with like a sign and some flashing lights.     Oh. Wait.
The ignorance in America is great!  It never stops
How do these nimrods not know the clearance of what they are pulling?
He has more money than sense.
I'll just sneak up on it and I won't be #175. Then I'll ignore the other drivers honking try to warn me.
He should have had eye balls outside to guide him.
Love when this channel posts. But one question, what is up with the "Rikers Island" text on the intro/outro?
I have seen the videos of this low bridge so many times you would think the idiots running that city would raise the bridge a foot to prevent the countless wrecks here.
My guess is that he didn't even know his clearance to begin with.
At least he destroyed rooftop equipment slowly....LOL!
If it wasn't 11'8" before, it is now. This bridge was made to torment renters and campers. Ryder and Penske probably have rooms full of filing cabinets filled with paperwork relating to this bridge.
Just another statistic.
This channel and the one with the flooded road 🤣🤣🔥🔥
"Maybe if I go slow, it will do $5000 worth of damage instead of $12000 worth of damage..."
LOL!   I guess he didn’t care.
is this in Boston?
How I've missed the can opener LOL LOL LOL
For one thing, that bar that crosses the road right before the bridge needs to be lower...if you are able to get under that bar and not hit anything...you should be able to get under the bridge!  But then again...if you have something that high you should know the highest point of your vehicle!
Did the driver think he could sneak under the bridge by driving slowly?
How stupid are people??? I can´t help thinking that they get what they desreve!
lol ......you can raise a bridge ..but not some people's IQ
I just love the train of thought of these drivers:  "Oh, look. I got a red light and there's a huge, blinking sign stating that there's a vehicle that surpasses the bridge's clearance height. Could it be me, in my huge rental truck/trailer/RV/crane/army transport? Nah, it is probably because of that Miata that's next to me. Better soldier on and keep going straight!"
makes me wonder if insurance adjusters watch this channel just for the opportunity to deny an insurance claim? Aduster: Your claim has been denied.  We have video of you ignoring the height restriction sign.  *Signals accounting for premium increase!*
yet another brand new rv owner keeping it awesome. Its been a great entertaining couple of years camping  since the covid campers came out! Ive seen it all!
Thousands of dollars of voluntary damage, not to find an alternate route. You win, Sir.
What this guy forgot was to yell real loud after sneaking up on the bridge. The bridge will jump in fright, and the driver can get through without damage. 😉🤣🤣🤣
The Bridge must be fed . . .  MUST TURN NOW apparently means Slow down, you'll make it.
This has to be a tourist attraction by now.
11foot8 does not discriminate!!! It will take what it wants from you...🤨
Nom nom nom nom nom 😋
What a moron. How does someone get to the point that they can afford this toy and yet they don't have the common sense to go along with ownership?
Well, he DID turn, as the sign told him to do. Just a tad late, that's all.
If he had let the air out of the tires it might have made it. 😂
excuse me whats that noise   oh just turn up the radio
I would love to see an interview with that driver and find out why they decided to go forward after the flashing sign warning and continue to go forward even when the other drivers were attempting to alert them. That would be a fascinating bit of psychology. Why would turning there be so bad that they would be willing to live with the damage to the camper? The fact that they went so slow makes it seem more deliberate and considered. So why?
Drive really slowly and it will suddenly drop 3 inches of height - Source:    Trust me bro
I rented a class c every and asked how high it was. The owner said he didn’t know. He had  8 identical rv’s on the lot. I knew my route has no overpasses, so I took it anyway. There should have been a sticker on the dash to let renters know. That what I had on my truck with a slide in camper.
Once again the bridge claims another victim and it stands tall and proud for another job well done. Many have tried and failed others have just squeaked by never to repeat this to anyone. There is only one winner and it's the 11 ft 8+8 bridge who's NEXT lol🤔😲😈🌉🤣🤣
"If I come in slowly enough the bridge will have time to move out of the way" -Them probably
You don't think that flashing over height sign is for me do ya?
This is a great IQ test
😆😅🤣😂🤡
Why does nobody learn?!?!?
Just a little off the top please ☺
The Invisible Troll strikes again.
In civilized country they put mobile panels before the bridge at the same height that making noises warn the driver that he cannot pass
Funny how people think that by driving slow, they can outsmart the bridge.  This never gets old.
Next time he should gun it so at least he can say he didn't see the sign or something.
The camper driver did the first step right, stopped the vehicle. Then they should have BACKED up slowly until they could turn around and avoid the notorious Canopener.
Quick honey.. Get out and let the air out of the tires....
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
There's a bridge in Brixton, London UK that says 3' 11". I'm pretty sure it's wrong 😆
Why does the sign say 12 4? Is the orange bar at 11 8?
A treasure trove 🧳💎, that just keeps on giving 😉 Cheers, guys, have a great spring & summer!
The sign should flash "overheight must turn - this means you".
The bridge must eat!!
That's right I'll slow waaaaaay down and fool the bridge, it will never feel me go in, just like your last date. Proof us humans, you can't fix stupid.
Everyone honking and he still went through lol⚠️😲🤔😳😁
"Just a little off the top, please."
Can't fix stupid, but there are body shops smiling all the way to the bank.
This goes to show that stupid is as stupid does !! These people can’t read a sighn !!
Tourist
Man, they really ought to consider some kind of automated warning system that detects overheight vehicles and flashes a big sign that tells them they have to turn. Otherwise, this is going to keep happening.
yolo
why do people think that slowing down will help you fit?
Lmao. If you go slow you can go under low bridges. Ummm no. No you can't.
Gotta be a serious trumper to hear all the honking and still go ahead anyway.
It worckt ifn he remembered the Gear on top attached extra!, maeby hang ac stuff on endwall behind trailer?
Ah. My favorite channel on youtube.
This has to be CGI 🇦🇺😂😂😂
Not even duct tape can fix that kind of stupid.
A typical American driver!
A friend and I watched a man trash the top of his RV in the parking garage of a casino. He backed up, then proceeded forward closer to the wall until he could ease around what he'd caught his RV on. The noise of him hitting was loud, and bits of parking garage chipped off. I decided to move my car off that level. When my friend and I went into the hotel of the casino, we saw a parking valet looking so distraught, we asked what was wrong. He told us a man was complaining to his boss that he, the parking valet, had trashed his RV while parking it and that the man and his wife were making a big stink, threatening to sue and asking for all kinds of comps. Well, well, well... it was the same guy my friend and I had seen. We asked to see the valet guy's boss. The boss came out and we told him what we'd witnessed. The boss asked if we'd write affidavits explaining what we saw. We said, yes. RV guy and his wife were standing firm with their story. Then my friend and I told them we were in the blue Corvette parked right where he smashed his rig while heading to the next level. The look on their faces was priceless. They tried to leave. Hotel security wasn't having that. Police were called. We found out surveillance cams weren't working on the level showing the RV guy trashing his rig. BUT! Cams were working near the entrance and in front of the hotel. The cams showed the guy pulling in the parking garage and the top of his rig was fine. The cams also showed him exiting the parking garage with damage visible. It was apparent RV guy simply drove to another level of the parking garage, then exited and pulled right up to the valets across the street and handed over his keys. RV guy and his wife made a show of browsing around in the hotel shops. When they figured enough time had passed, the guy headed out to where the valet had parked his rig. I wished y'all could've seen the acting job this guy did after he "discovered" the damage to his RV. In the end, the RV-guy and his wife weren't arrested, but they were banned from the hotel/casino, and the valet received an apology. My friend and I were thanked by hotel/casino management -  WE got comped a FREE 3-day weekend = hotel room, free casino play and free meals!
This is why insurance goes up every month!!! 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
And the can opener gets another snack. This will never get old.
Not enough warning signs.
Beautiful.
I miss the days when the bridge would rip the entire roof off, but this is still funny
Just perfect!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
They rather take the damage than admitting their mistake and reverse out of the situation.
LMAO!  Stupid people getting what they deserve.
Meh, he didn't need those two A/C units anyway.  Barely even a snack for the bridge!
He stopped just before tells me he had doubts about getting under there,    shoulda backed off and gone another way !!
LOL
People never fail to amaze me.
Why oh why oh why!!!
Well that’s about 15k worth of damage
Over hight doesn't mean much to people until they have to pay the price to fix their stupid mistake.
He figures if he sneaks on it the bridge won't bite! Ha! The bridge always wins!!!!  Truly makes you wonder why people think they can sneak under this thing
The Farmer's Insurance guy goes "we've seen a thing or two".
There’s going to be some nasty paperwork and a whole bucket 🪣 load of money 💵 thrown at the repair.  You know the driver is going to pay way more to ‘repair’ the bridge than his trailer. Yikes.😬
Seems people never learn. Makes you wonder if these drivers have any idea of  height  !
Sue the city.  Posted at 12'4"  lower the road 3 feet.  There; solved your problem.
thats a several thousand dollar "shortcut"...
D'OH!
Top surgery...
liked b4 watching...cause i know
It's ok, he had his tow mirrors turned up... that makes him invincible!
Why is it so funny watching idiots ruin their nice campers. Like mic bag says “this simply never gets old”
Sad thing is he ALMOST made it! My Dad bought a trailer once that they told him the height of it.   He did some checking himself after he bought it (former semi driver) and he discovered they hadn't included the top Ac in the height!    Maybe it was the same with this guy, but he didn't try and check it?
Welcome back!   Have really missed seeing idiots get their roofs shredded.
They are born every day and modern tech trumps Darwin...
Just keep on driving and fix it later. Needs a ticket for being an asshole.
After so many months without feeding she just got to nibble a few crumbs... She must be starving...
Anyone with an RV that big MUST know what the height is before attempting to go under any underpass.  I still can't understand why people can't see the flashing lights and warning signs when they drive up to that underpass.  Those people just caused several thousands' worth of damage to their home-on-wheels. Unbelievable!
LMFAO  LOL LOL
goes slow then stops ... after the damage
So I am told our camper is 11.1 feet, better check.
They all think going slower helps !!!
Maybe the aircons were faulty, $2000 replace cost or $800 insurance excess....
Uh, kinda hard to miss the "OVERHEIGHT - MUST TURN" sign.
Sorry, but these idiots are funny.If the bridge didn't have so many warning signs it would be different.
Was his fathers camper
Yup. Here’s yer sign!…I mean it…  HERES YOUR SIGN!   ‘MUST TURN’🙄
Those ACs and vent repairs are much cheaper than rerouting 1/2 mile. He knew best.
SCORE CAMPER 0 BRIDGE 1
He should a went fast to get a nice clean cut shave!😄
At first it looks close, like he could squeeze under. Then he doesn't
Unreal.......
You can’t fix stupid.
I would think that going slowly only makes it worse, you stand there and risk getting stuck.
I'm sure it was worth it..
It never gets old!
"I don't wanna damage the bridge that much, So I'll just drive though it slowly".
How stupid can you be! It even warns you!!!
Welcome, Clark W. Griswald.
kinda sneaky when u make it past the yellow marker then hit a lower bridge
"honey, what was that??"
I think the flashing sign needs to call vehicles out specifically maybe ... "YOU in the truck towing the camper, you're about to get a haircut!"
The bridge say's pay the toll Stupid!!!!!!
Yay .. more chompers ... num num !! :D
Looks like the driver thought: "No police officer in sight, so what can go wrong?"
Let's just hope the owner has plenty of money so his stupidity isn't really THAT painful !  Remember that working people will earn some cash repairing all the damage and that's GREAT !
Will they ever learn? Lol
Hahaha love it
IF he Took Some Air out of his Tires he would of made it free.
Astonishing.... even if it says "Overheight, must turn" the people just dont believe it.  Perhaps they shoud put a flashing sign up on the other side, saying "See... I told you so."
I guess They’re going to have to add crossing gates that come down if you’re too high
Big bright strobe lights will work.
Someone should dig the road a few inches lower.
What do people think they are going to gain by not turning? These guys obviously have no idea what the actual height of their trailer is, so why chance it? Discretion is most definitely the better part of valour in the case of this bridge.......... stubborn old bastards are just determined to ruin their vacation and destroy their A/C though......... I hope their insurance doesn't pay out cos they ignored the signs.
There are apps that will route you around these things. Despite hearing the scraping sound, buddy just carry’s on. More money than brains I guess.
My question is, isn't the yellow warning bar supposed to be the same height as the bridge? ie "If you hit this bar you WILL hit the bridge!". So why did he clear the bar? Is it set wrong? (I'm not downplaying the drivers guilt, they drove right under the "Must Turn" warning sign, my question is strictly about the bar!)
Says it's 12'4"?
Some people just can’t read or they don’t think warning signs are not meant for them
He just keeps goin
And we have to share the roads with these morons. Thing is he wasn't the usual clueless driver we usually see here. From the way he crept along he knew it was a very iffy proposition to try and squeeze under but went for it anyway.
Man, people are stupid!
Oops!!
“maybe if i go slow enough nothing bad will happen”
Maybe if I go slower my height will be shorter?
I love how one of the vents falls on to the road
QUALIFIED!!!! (Pretty sure this is one of the boaters I saw back brand truck into 12 feet of water dropping his boat...before he switched to campers!!!)
Maybe they should've lowered the bridge so that many drivers wouldn't even get the Idea of passing
You can afford that truck and rig but you don't have enough intelligence to know what your height is
Now he fits.
must be on way to Trump rally, where stupid rules
This never gets old.
Can't they see that half of that bridge and know that what's going to happen when they go 100 that just amazes me
Got to admire this driver's technique as he had clearly given it some thawt  unlike a lot of numbskulls who simply believe speed will lead to success.
TOO LAZY TO BACK UP.    Takes more work to replace all of that damage than to back up in the first place.
I love this
Aw shit, I hit something. Better destroy the rest of my roof. That sign was not clear enough.
What a treat 😍
whoa, that's gotta hurt! (george costanza).
They could easily solve this by dangling metal chains measured to the height restriction from a bar running across that set of lights.
be funny if it started pouring down rain later that day
We didn't need those parts anyway.....
Definitely a rental that he doesn't give a fuck about.
Wife:  Can we fit? Husband:  No problem. I can’t believe you would doubt me. 💥 💥 scrape crumble 💥  Wife:  (stares at husband) Husband:  (…You finish this conversation)
I bet that ignoring the sign voids the insurance, ouch!
I towed an RV for 3 years and new EXACTLY how high it was. That's a basic rule of ownership that this guy never knew.
There should be one in every city.  🤣🤣
Wife: Honey STOP you're not going to fit! Husband: I'm fine, I'm fine, here, I'll slow down ok?  10 seconds later...  Wife:  I hope you brought your tent...
It's a toll bridge; an expensive toll bridge.
Yes simple physics isn't it?
Solution That waterfall stop sign thing where it projects a stop sign but make it specifically align with the overheight vehicle Lane specific stop lights that isolate the overheight vehicle's ability to go forward at the intersection  Aggressive solution If a tripwire is hit, vehicle barriers deploy under the crash bar
And still the undisputed can opener champion of the world.
This is how DUMBASSES keeps everybody employed.....
JB Hunt driver on vacation😂😂😂😂
None on Apr 1st ,  shame.
Don’t do it!
Maybe the trailer-guy doesn’t know what 11’ - 8” means. What is 11 feet minus 8 inches? 10’ 4”?  Then there’s that +8. Is that + infinity?
He thought if he snuck up on it, all quiet and tip-toed, he'd make it.  Video says the bridge is still the boss!
This is why learning to read is so important.
"Honey I think we should find another way around. I don't think we'll be able to squee--" "Don't tell me how to drive, woman!"
When the barber asks…”How much should I take off the top”… Oh just a close crop should do!
When Darwin gets bored, he watches videos like this one...
Itll be ok if i just go real slow lol . Goin slow doesn't make yr ride shorter lmao
The bridge always feeds
Signs, lights, rumble strips, honking horns will NOT cure aggressive stupidity.
I would simply not drive under the bridge.
another victim for the bridge eh ?
Amazed how dumb people are.
He knew he was in trouble before he got under the bridge. But his pride refused to let him stop and back out. Costly mistake.
"Just a bit off the top please"
You can not fix STUPID, IGNORANT and BRAIN DEAD people. They should have to pay out of pocket, with no insurance claims allowed.
When the sign says to high turn around you just keep going on to the cost of thousands of dollars.
If the clarence is 12'4" and you're 12'5", no matter how slow you take it, you're not gonna make it.
Truck driver did his math correctly, just forgot about those darn ac units 🙄🙄
This bridge collects its own toll. No troll needed.
Feed Her !!!!
Just a little off the top please.
This fkng bridge they will never fix it lol. Years later and still the same🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Must be Clark Griswold or a Swift driver.
A little tin can chomp chomp for the bridge!
Simply going slowly doesn’t magically make you fit
Soooooo close.
We need to lower the bridge back down and get back after it!
How stupid!! When in doubt obey the warning and turn.
And he is driving on our hwy
I do not get it.  I have watched 10's of these vids over the past three years, pandemic boredom, always the same.  The sign clearly specifies the clearance - what the hell is wrong with the people.  Now I will admit, the  driver is clueless as to the height of their vehicle, but professional drivers?
Probably didn't need those parts
Nice and relaxed this time...
Vent caps and skylight shrouds for an RV = $1000 easy if you take it into the repair centers that scam people.. I'm a take a guess that some camper "specialist" told them the ENTIRE ROOF including the AC unit and all wiring had to be replaces when all it needed was some cheap vent caps..
Who had this date in the pool ?
If you're so unsure, why even attempt it?
oh snapper!  As a puller of RVs....oy 3 Dometics down!
Turn The Radio Up You Won't Notice a Thing !
They need to build a work around on this, I have seen this exact scene way to often, city needs to fix it now or have a permanent flagger checking all trucks and trailers on one lane.
Here's your sign...  🤣😂🤣😂
Interesting that he got under the yellow warning bar, but didn't get under the bridge.
tosser
Yes feed it more
That looks expensive
"I'm going to drive my tall vehicle under this low bridge that's famous for shearing off the tops of tall vehicles. What can possibly go wrong?"
My wife and I have been watching these videos for years and can never figure out why the municipality can't get it fixed.
Who needs ac while camping??
Cheapest method for installing a new moon roof.
Come on dude, this was totally staged and fake! You guys are way too gullible!!!!😜😜😜😜😜
I'm in a hurry  , cannot let the beer gets hot 😂
The problem was he wasnt going fast enough. Dude, you gotta absolutely floor it for that move to work!
I love how the emergency sign seems to stop flashing at the exact moment he decides to go for it!!!!! Sign, "OK, f@#$ it dude. Go ahead and give it your best shot! You did this to you!"
Did he really think 11.8.8 would be caught looking the other way?
the blinking warning sign should not be like "overweight must turn". it should display: "you are overheight!" the way it is now, ppl still don't think it applies to them
Dumpers are funny ! " I dont need to follow any dumb signs or laws !"
Ya cant really blame a 4 wheeler since they are not trained to pay attention to their clearance.  CDL drivers on the other hand ARE trained and should know better but they hit that bridge more.
Enough is enough... prohibit all truck traffic & similar vehicles from using this road, or get rid of this bridge. It's not funny anymore, if it ever was...?!
How fn stupid you gotta be to keep going?!?!🤪🙄😂😂🤪
"Hon, I think we made it!"  Think again, Skippy!
**HERE IT IS  MAY...  WHY WASNT THIS POSTED IN APRIL??????**
This bridge is 12 shoes and 4 eggs high, and then people are surprised when things go wrong 🤣
Gee officer I don't understand, my pickup went under it just fine.
This guy to his wife: I told you it fits! His wife later: ☠️
I'm kinda annoyed that he cleared the warning bar. Looks bad, but I think those are just vent covers.
Who TF puts a bar to purposely drop the clearance from 12' 4" to 11'8"?
What was he thinking? Ignorance.
That looked expensive
I will have to record idiots going around road close signs and trying to figure out how to get around a gaping ass hole in road where a bridge or culverts are being install. Signs are put up for a reason
Can't people see the signs or should they be re-tested for their reading skills...... I assume this bridge also has a siren of some kind...
Bridge troll needs air conditioner. Takes toll.
Why did he keep going?! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
That my dear is what we call a twat 🤪
Yesss he's back c:
It's Durham... Everyone is a friggin idiot and can't drive if their lives depended on it.
If in doubt just ease your way under it, makes less damage to everything you are going to have ripped off the top, with so many clearances listed on bridges around the country you think people would have their heights measured on their motorhomes, makes for a more relaxing vacation.
My wallet says turn around, my pride says be a man, dont back up and turn around. 🤣
You either pass or you don't, low speed won't save those flimsy parts.
So at 0:15 the sign comes on after the driver has passed the point of seeing it?...Yup dumb ass people who made this warning sign...How about having a sensor before the driver gets to this point?
Who needs air conditioning.
ah shit ,here we go again
Oh, my hero
This dude slows down like he knows he's probably not going to make it, but then keeps going as stuff falls off his camper and people are honking at him. What a world.
Why dont they put something some distance in front that hangs on chain to hit as a warning ? or just redirect all truck's to a  different route ?
How many times 🙀
If he just gone a little slower......
This makes me sad for the driver.  You have to get on top of your RV and measure top down plus measure your a/c and add that in.  Dont believe what your salesman or manual say the height is. Add at least four more inches just for kicks and variations in pavement. Write it down and tape it to your drivers console so you dont forget in 6 months.
Just a little off the top thanks! ✂️
Everyone knows driving slower makes ur trailer shorter 🤦
😮🤭🤔Achtung 🤬🙋‍♀️🇨🇭
THE BRIDGE STRIKES AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BWAHAHA!!!!!!
The real pandemic is stupidity.
💥 If His Hitch Was Lower He Would Have Been Fine💥
It's like putting up a wet paint sign, people still think it's OK.
Bodyshop on the left -----------------------------------------------Driver's retest on the right ....Beside the free eye exam place On Plain English Rd
Zero fucks given
Imagine paying attention enough to know it's a low bridge but still being too stupid to take another route. That's a special kind of stupid.
What physics class did these dudes take to think speed equals height?
THey could fix this if they wanted to
Couldn’t they hollow out the roadway more around the bridge. Why play cat and mouse games with equipment.
Nothing, absolutely nothing, not a big flashing sign that reads Over Height must Turn!!!!! Flashing over and over..... 🙄🤦
This kind of a thing happens again and again and again. They don't want to raise the bridge. Presumably it's too expensive. Why don't they spend a week or two and get in there with a bull dozer and make that small section of street under the bridge a foot or two lower?
They could put up a camera and a 100 inch screen showing the over height vehicle with flashing arrows. The OH truck driver would still assume it is the nearby sedan that is the problem.
Always a delight. Dumb is when they race through without a clue until the crash. REALLY dumb is when they know they are close, and they think they'll shrink if they go slower.
We got the truck loaded bikes on the back ready to have a great weekend camping out.  But wait there’s a sign ahead flashing Must Turn.    FUK it.  Bye bye A/C units!   Lol.
i didnt need that shit anyway
Idiot 🤣👍
I don’t get it. It’s like this is the only road you can ever take. I mean, go around
American’s can’t read or they can’t be told…either way you guys are funny 😆
Brings a joy to my day :D Thank you can opener bridge for brightening my day.
Like to sit there and bring a chair and a sandwich or two and wait for an idiot to come along.. THAT would be a pretty good day.
I once saw a sigh that read, “wet paint…TRUST ME”.
And, for the love of the good Christ, they raised the bridge 8”…now, why not simply lower the road by a foot. Oh, I guess I know…there wouldn’t be any more great vids!
Who doesn’t know the height of their camper? Mine is a C-Class on an E450 Super Duty chassis and I guarantee that it’s 11’4” to the top of the AC unit. Still, I ain’t goin’ under that darn bridge!!!
Bruh there has to be another way around....I would rather drive another 10 minutes than damage my camper...Common sense isn't so common these days.
Although its good to see the bridge in action again, i was hoping for a real rip-roaring, smash and crash. Because, don't forget, as going slow helps you fit better, so does high speed.
That's going to be pricy!
Deserved every ounce of that, and should have to pay a fine to cover pain dmg and road clean up
Does anyone know the purpose of that shorn off equipment?
Extra parts lol.    Course in that situation you're trying to get through and you start hearing all this honking they probably assume there is somebody behind them trying to get by and are complaining that they're moving so slow so they just keep going
Some people are born stupid. Everybody that drives under this bridge don't know how high there trailers are. These people are the stupid ones. Then they will call there insurance company and lie about there damages. Insurance Fraud
The air in his tires made the difference
Has sunroof option now
I swear I used to live near this is this right by uncg in Greensboro?
In order to go under the tressle deflate all the tires
Good luck finding replacement parts in this economy !!
Thank you for the frequent entertainment... Hope it continues (But I guess I shouldn't wish for that) ...
Dumb-dee-dumb-dumb.
Its as if he knew he was going to hit but didn't care.
And he’s on the road with the rest of us :/
Ah, camping 🏕 season is in the air.  It was just a matter of time 🕑 🕙 🕚.
I bet of they dropped the tire pressures on the trailer to near zero they could have escaped the wrath
I got nothing for this guy. The sign told him. The people tried to tell him. He DESERVED every dollar of damage.
Well, to be fair, he only lost *part* of the stuff on top. 😂😂😂
11 foot 9 before 11 foot 8 after. ;) .
I’m looking for a YouTube channel that combines 11foot8 with Rufford Ford.
Don't they have warnings on GPS that tell you these things, or maps?  More & more I see signs next to the road warning about low bridges.  Maybe he doesn't know how high his/hers trailer heighr, or changed suspension, added leaves in the back to compensate for the trailer weight on the tongue.
THANKS.. SOMETHING TO IMPROVE MY DAY!🤣🤣🤣
And there is proof that even a blind person can get a drivers license.
We have a train bridge like that in a town near me. There are at least four to six posts a month of people running up under it like that. My favorite is when the semi drivers do it. I have to laugh because I know they are either beginners or they can't read. People keep complaining saying that the bridge is a hazard. I think it's more like evolution at its finest. If you're too stupid to go up under the bridge then you don't need to go under the bridge. I personally have renamed our bridge the F round and find out bridge
As if slowing down changes the clearance in this drivers mind. Lol.
It hurts like a band-aid, you have to pull it off really fast so it doesn't hurt as bad. He went way too slow.
We need a camera with a microphone in the parking area on the other side.
0:41 is the perfect ending.  The roof vent rolling off and hitting the middle of the street with that sheet metal "clank" -- like a cognac after a fine dinner.
The driver is so stupid. He sees the lite sign but still goes. Good for him. Damages for an itdiot.
As Don Adams would say: Missed by that much
wow people dont get it.
With the amount of insurance payed out over The Mighty Bridge where does the Highway Dept stand  on this, or are they keeping it as a testament to a failed bureaucracy or maybe even leaving it stand  for we the people and our posterity?
A lot of newbies living the RV dream…
That last plop of the equipment at the end - priceless!
You guys are laughing at him slowing down, but in my Jeep, when I slowed down to a few mph, I could let all the air out of my shocks and get the Jeep to drop about 3". I wonder if some of these people do just that. This guy probably didn't do that, but I just thought I'd mention it as food for thought...
Money can buy a huge truck and camper but not sense
I hope they stopped to look at just what happened!!! Wow! I hope the driver was ok.
The trick is to drive just a little bit slower then tall things will actually fit under the bridge.
The bridge was hungry!
This YouTube channel needs a bibliography, or "Page of Shame!" I'd LOVE to know the names, ages and occupations of the complete morAns who do this.  Suspended licenses would be appropriate.  If they can't figure this shit out, how can they operate any large vehicle safely?  Edit:  "ANY vehicle safely!"
Imagine how entertaining this will be when levitating trucks are invented.
There are advantages to a bumper pull RV....one being under 11 feet 🤣
I'm suprised they havent resorted to some the a railroad crossing gate
For whom the bridge tolls.
I guess they thought the bridge would say "oh, excuse me" and move out of the way if they gave it a chance to move. 🤔
Well the trailer did actually fit! It was just the AC compressor, roof vent etc that didn't
If I go slow it won't Hit Ohh dam ! They keep going, Wonder if they cleaned up their mess. Bet the local tire shops love this street !!
looks like the ac made it through
This is the Tim Taylor approach to making so they could add more power by removing the old stuff 'by accident.'
As the 12'-4" sign sparkles gleefully.
We had a 5th wheel for years and I know exactly the height of my rig. You can't sneak up a bridge and think you will squeeze by if you drive real slow.  lol
Aww that bridge looks hungry, we should remove some signs, it's not like they work.
Remember, when you think your vehicle is too tall, slow right down. Because a lower speed is a lower vehicle.
That's an expensive weekend lol
I have a similar sized RV. Know your height! And, if you think you're gonna hit, have someone get out and take a look. If that rubber roof got torn,  big $$$$$$$
The really stupid part is this bridge has been idiots vehicles for years. There are dozens of signs in all directions as you approach this bridge. They say stuff like, if you're not absolutely sure don't attempt. The signs are totally ineffective for the illiterate.
Only in Las Vegas have I seen someone burn through $15,000 that quickly.
My GPS told me...    bet that was expensive repair
The whole idea of slowing down is if you hit, you can stop and limit the damage.  You can stop and back up before you destroy more of you your vehicle and prevent yourself getting stuck.  Seems drivers forget the reason of slowing and decide to triple down when they make contact.
WHY?  Guess you cannot fix stupid!
Maybe if the town painted teeth on the bar people would get the message.
I never went to Harvard university but even I can see that this was not going to fit under the bridge 🙄
She: "Honey, what's that noise?"   He: "Nothing! I drive slowly enough!"
Crunch time again.
Cue the TPIR Losing Horns!!  Victim 176, you're next to #comeondown to face the can opener bridge!!
- Go slow! *CRACK* - Ugh did you hear that? - What? *CRAAAACK* - That! *CRAAACK* - See, we're through!
Wish they left it the old way
about time
Does going really slow make it hurt less?
What a DA
If you don't know the height of whatever you're towing, you shouldn't be towing anything
'Delores, I hate those ACs on top of the trailer but I'm too busy to take them off myself'..'Bill, not to worry the local underpass offers free shaves and haircuts'...
What a moron! Not only does he not know what 12' 4" means, someone was trying to let him know he was in deep doo doo and he still keeps right on going. He would have saved himself a few hundred dollars by stopping at the first horn blow.
"Over Height, Must Turn" Driver is like, nope doesn't apply to me.
Haha always a dodge/ fiat/Stellantis
If he's going to go so slow like that, nearly stopping, and clearly aware the bridge might rip off his equipment, why in the world wouldn't he put it in park and get out and look?
So glad the bridge got another snack. Has been too long! LOL  He should of just floored it and said the hell with it, lol.
When you try a different shaving cream, but it doesn't work LOL
All that available cash for a big honking truck and a behemoth camper... Should have set a few bucks aside for brains.
Remember folks, most of these dimwits that somehow miss several flashing signs and warnings and end up damaging/destroying expensive property....they vote.
People! Stop making funny comments about this poor man's plight!! I mean, I can't like them all!
Every driver who tries to sneak up on the bridge reminds me of Homer Simpson skating over the gorge...I'm gonna make it! I'm gonna make it! This is the greatest thrill of my life! I'm king of the world! Woo-hoo! (crash)
As far as I have discovered so far in a 64-year lifetime, there are only two (2)n unwavering absolutes in this Universe:  1) Entropy always increases; and  2) 11'-8" is always 11'-8", and this bridge always wins any argument or contrary opinion.   -C
If I go slow enough, my vehicle will get short enough to fit under the big yellow bar!
if it's only 11 foot 8 inches - why does the sign say 12 foot 4 inches?   - maybe the driver thought he could clear it because of the misleading and deceptive sign?
OVERHEIGHT..MUST TURN.. dude must not like reading signs too much
How stupid of him
He went under slowly though, so it only slowly tore the top equipment off.
Love how this arrived on my birthday (woo-hoo!), and how the driver seems to believe that,if he goes slowly enough, the trailer will magically sneak under the bar.  Notice how the a/c unit gets flung into the right lane as a “sacrifice”! Also, he knew he’d screwed the pooch, cuz he took the left turn immediately, to call his brother: “Hello, Mike?…Yeah, it’s Earl. Listen, y’know that sweet camper trailer you let me an’ Earlene use for our vacation to North Carolina? Yeah…the A/C suddenly stopped workin’. Yep, just quit…..No, I have no idea why…I just…hello? Hello? Mike?!”
Nibble, nibble.  OOOp's. Dropped it! Damn.
This city never ceases to amaze me how many people ignore the big sign that says turn! Yet there hasn't been much accident lately.
That's going to cost some money.
Great! Slow motion!
people are seriously thick in the head.
That's one vacation that will have a story that never stops being brought up.🤦‍♂️
Giant flashing sign that's basically says "MORON.... TURN BACK!" and they still ignore it. Mind boggling
once you hear something, it's too late.
Ale baran
The finale being the sound of the fallen "equipment" hitting the road. Standing ovation!
"Fuck you! Those things are a bitch to reach for cleaning!"
Crockpot speed makes it more soft and tender for the bridge to enjoy its meal
I guess he thought all those warning horns meant its safe go faster...
If we just real slow we'll fit! The bridge wins again!🤣
-"Overheight, must turn" -Press X to doubt Driver: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXx
Bridge over Troubled minds
I don’t understand why they keep going ….they hear it scrape and say “yeah let’s do a lot of damage can a scrape . No reason to back up “
Just turn like the sign says and reroute yourself, how hard can it be?
Did he think the bridge would rise because he drove slower...🤔 The bridge wins every time. 🚧 🚛
How is it.. that he fit under the warning bar.. but still hit the bridge??  Is the warning bar too high?
How?? Especially since there is a freaking sign telling you to turn you are too high?
going slow doesn't make you smaller
“Hmm… ‘Overhieght, MUST turn’? Funny suggestion, must not be for me. If I go slow enough, maybe it won’t decapitate my vehicle. All that honking must be for someone else, I’m not doing anything wrong. If those are my pieces falling to the ground, I’ll deal with it later, should only cost a few bucks right?”
go slow that'll save me
They really need to make the traffic light go flashing yellow when the OVERHEIGHT MUST TURN LIGHT is lit.  The green light contradict the sign.
Almost Got away with it
Nom Nom Nom
$2,000 repair bill? Will insurance pay?
$3000 in damage because he didn't want to go around the block 🤦‍♂️
This whole thing is proof that government can screw up the simplistic things.
This guy needs a bumper sticker saying 'Your dog or cat is smarter than this driver'. What a doifus!
what they need is an arm to drop down like those at railroad crossings to block that side of the road to prevent people from driving under the bridge... but they'd probably mow it over as well....
That's unlucky - he had definitely slowed down enough to make the height
Lol.
NO CO KUR......A JA SIĘ NIE ZMIESZCZE JA NIE PRZEJADĘ ????? NO I PRZEJECHAŁEM
Hoots! Mon.
I hope the driver cleaned up his mess, it must be quite irritating for other non-idiotic drivers when victims leave their sacrificial offerings lying in the middle of the road out of sheer embarrassment or blissful ignorance.
Maybe they should add a speaker to the flashing sign.  "HEY DUMBASS!  THIS MEANS YOU!"
He's got enough money to afford it LOL 😂😂😂. I guess they will be sleeping in the hotel tonight. When it rains LOL
ANOTHER DEMOCRAT
Maybe they thought the sign on the bridge was fake news.
Why is the yellow bar higher than the bridge bottom? It didn't touch the trailer.
It's usually already painful to watch someone ruin their camper and cause thousands in damage, but he slowed down because he had a hunch it would be tight and the damage unfolded in slow motion... made me cringe even more!
There is an idiot born every minute.
Simply priceless!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣
she eats!
The bridge won.... again.....
It's painful to watch.
Idiots❗️ they never ever stop, ever‼️®™️  🤣🤣
Watching all these videos, it seems like there is always just a few cm missing and bridge is like specially made lower :)
Ah the good ole sneak under the can opener technique
The bridge is still eating, just not as much. :-)
Dumb and dumber. When you take a large, heavy, wide and/or high load....you own it. Taking responsibility and using common sense will make you NOT approach this overcrossing. Geez................
The old "if I go slow, the bridge will flex and no one will notice" idea.
And there goes another paycheck.
And he almost made it without littering! 🤣🤣
LOOKS LIKE TRAILERS ARE BACK ON THE MENU BOYZ!!!!
Man I've seen so many of these videos if I came upon this bridge, I don't even think I would risk trying to get my 86 monte carlo under it, let alone a 5th  wheel
Maybe if they go real fast they can make it.
"Shame on the mess!"
A savvy entrepreneur could make a killing in the R.V. equipment and scrap metal business in this neighborhood.
well, lazy ass tried!  bout 5 grand and hope it dont rain,, poor wife.
Driving slower doesn't make your 12-2 trailer shrink to 11-7! Lol
Stupid is..... is what stupid dose....
Damn, why couldn't the bridge still be just a little lower?
Probably turned it into insurance.
Not nearly as exciting as years past, but fun nonetheless.  The gift that keeps on giving!
A melancholy reminder of how things once were.
Bridge finally came out of its winter hibernation!
Whats that crunching sound idk lets keep going
Yet another victim.
You can tell the driver really thought he knew better than the laser guided warning signs of the bridge on how high his trailer was.
He must've thought it's more of a hassle to make a turn than it is to replace those pieces that got peeled off of the camper.
I was wondering when we'd get a new crash.
👍👍😎✌️ Know the height of your equipment, people!
no TV [or possibly Internet] when they set up camp tonight [whatever aerial / dish that is that gets crushed]
I click on these faster than any other video
You'll never lose a bet if you place your money on stupid.
you love to see it
You'd think by now we'd be out of tall things to run into the bridge
Apparently they found the APP that steers you away from there. Or they dont read so good
The only other solution I guess is to dig the road bed deeper. But then u create a flooding problem like other bridges have.
Just another inch!
$4k shortcut, nice
And  on  top of everything else,  helpful motorist sounds warning,  and "we" just keep driving anyway LOLOL
"Almost" only counts when pitching horseshoes. Canopener bridge doesn't play those games.
What a dumbshlt! Slows WAY down and STILL proceeds to destroy the thing.   It’s like they live their entire lives and somehow manage to not die of being stupid, teach retirement, but the gaudiest travel trailer and before it’s reached home, the old codger just kills it. 😂
Just a little snack to whet the appetite....
Yessss!...The Canopener is back!
I love the fact that they see the sign saying must turn, but somehow figure that if they creep up to it it will change the height....
The piece landing on the ground was so poetic.
And somehow this will be his insurance companys fault and responsibility.    Do not remember who the you tuber was but there is a vid out there showing the warning signs blocks before this.
Well...on the plus side, they made it thru
Just imagine how long it's going to take for the replacement parts to come in! They'll have to go the whole summer without whatever it was that got knocked out, and the AC if it scraped enough to get damaged.
I do not mean to be sarcastic here but:  Do you REALLY think this is news to me?  Campers and camper trailers are ALWAYS losing their rooftop shit at the 11-foot 8+8 bridge.  So this one is not the only one by any means --- and it won't be the last one either.
Funny how you find people perfectly willing to destroy their stuff, simply because the GPS tells them to go a certain way.
Might just be me but I swore I head a Flintstones sound effect with the first hit 🤣
The town should setup a place for tourists to watch the carnage from a safe viewing area, complete with a gift shop. They could also sell season passes!
I feel sorry for the bridge.
Never change, 11ft8 Bridge
I was just thinking of this channel, remembering that I hadn't seen a video from here in awhile.
He thought about stopping, then he said to himself nah I got this.
OK the big yellow bar must be a suggestion only, because the trailer passed under it with no problem. PS I see where the yellow bar did its job now.
0:21 = Guy behind the Wheel of Camper: “i am small” “I WILL FIT”            12’ 4 bridge: “you do you boo and “I WILL TOO” “LOL”
De- camper- tated
The piece falling off at the end is what got me
So why the signs reading 12'4"?!
You would think the railroad company would care - NOPE!
They really need to add the "Over height! Must Turn" sign one that flashed red "This Means You Stupid!"😁
why doesn't the sign say "YOUR vehicle is over height". it's too generic and if you aren't from there then you would assume that sign is just always flashing all the time. People don't realize the sign is flashing BECAUSE OF THEM , they just assume it's always flashing.
Just a little off the top....
I was thinking the other day it had been a while since the bridge had a snack
Driver..... Hey, that’s how I picked it up!
I don't know anything about this driver's age or fitness to drive, BUT.... 1. Saw, but misjudged warning signs/ bridge height - proceeded anyway 2. Couldn't FEEL stuff ripping off his trailer 3. Couldn't HEAR stuff ripping off his trailer  4. Couldn't HEAR other drivers frantically honking at him 5. Couldn't SEE stuff falling off his trailer 6. After all this - proceeded anyway 7. After all this - is this person fit to drive?! These are some of the people operating large vehicles on our public roadways. Of course, they're different. The rules don't apply to them. Human nature, I guess....
Must be the same people who use cellphones while driving...
they deserve a shitty vacation
Starved for months and now only just a nibble.
What town is this in???
Poor bridge only got a taste of that trailer.  Hope it gets a nice tall big rig to fill its empty belly.
The driver is as dumb as the city that put that in. It would have been easy to cut the dirt down another 3 ft before laying road base and pavement
Maybe the warning sign should read - OVER HEIGHT STOP / DO NOT ENTER The driver did turn AFTER the sign as instructed????
This bridge has been on SO MANY videos. Why dont they use state Tax dollars and fix it?  was it Left up to generate youtube videos? They spend $$ on 24 hour stream cam but refuse to raise the bridge a foot. This is crazy to me and i would be pissed!     MMMM mm mmm   TAXES
He clearly slowed down hahaha. WHat is the logic? does he think his vehicle will get smaller if he drives slower? lmao
It will fit fine on the way back.
My GPS says this way I must go The bridge ahead is too low I can make it, that I know I can make it if I go slow. Sigh, the road must be too high.
It was only their MaxAir vent covers, ACs remained attached 😁. We've seen way worse!! P.S. the antenna as well 😂
I KNOW that guy must have seen all those signs back down the road the way he came. Isn't there a level crossing a ways down if you turn left?
Seems he looked both ways, didn't see a cop, so decided to make a run for it
sometimes she likes it slow and sensual.
We are surrounded by them, they’re everywhere!
They almost made it.. only if they could've lowered the rv a few inches
That's a $75K+ trailer being pulled by a $75K truck.  Some people have more money than brains.
WTF!? There's literally signs everywhere about the hight of the pridge and even screen warning about the following accident 😂. Well, a camper doesn't mean one can haul it 😁
"What's that flashing sign? Surely it's not for me! If only I could read English"  *Smash*
And we drive around with these brain dead individuals daily.
People should really measure their trucks and trailers.
Everyone knows if you drive slow, your vehicle gets shorter.  That's just science
What in the fuck gives you the idea that you should keep going...
That’s a real dad, go for it.
New to the scene here, so why does the sign say 12'4" when the clearance is 11'8"?
🤷‍♂️ Ahhh The 'gift' that keeps on giving. 🤦‍♂️😉
Everyone saying he hit the BRIDGE, ./...no, technically he only hit the WARNING BEAM before the actual bridge that is Several inches lower THAN the bridge....
There must be a huge poster of this bridge at the Penske offices with the words "AVOID THIS BRIDGE!". It's been so long.
🤣 like a cartoon in slow mo.
I love when they think slowing down will stop the bridge from getting its meal
That's the ultimate toll bridge.
Technically so peaking he never hit the bridge. Clickbait!!
Must be nice to not care.
In my country, first of all, there is a photo cell acting a horn.
The bridge always wins… this is the way.
What's that rending noise? Oh, I'll just turn up the stereo....it'll be fine!
Just a little off the top, please.
"I'll just go real slow; nobody will notice."
Total drip brain
I think they will be in for a hot night minus the AC units.
Slow ≠ Low
make it if i go slow enough
Good to see you all again, it's been a long winter!
I was thinking of you today as I was walking home and came up to the 12ft3inch LIRR (Long Island Rail Road) overpass that's near my home.  All that's there is a sign indicating the height as well as a sign that tells vehicles that are over that height to go left or right. We don't have many RVs driving by and the 18-wheelers have other routes to travel on, so it doesn't get it. At least not by a too-tall vehicle.
im glad it is back on a feeding frenzy
The pickup driver looked into the eyes of the camper driver must be priceless.
That sign isn't the boss of me. I'll do what I want.
... (all the cars honking were thinking): Dumbass!
.... this was just sad.... and the asshole laying on the car horn didn't help matters, either....
He knew it was a problem and kept going anyway...SMH
Warning signs don't mean much in that part of the country.
At what point will the town figure out they need to dig the road down a bit instead of fixing the bridge?
They need to  lower it aging 🤣
They say 11'8" and sign I saw there said 12'4"!  ???
Unfortunate. They read the sign and wondered, but it was the stuff on top only. Somehow this doesn't seem very humorous...
The driver is definitely a Trump supporter.

Dunkey needs to do an update video on this.
“Just a ‘little’ off the top please!”…. The 11’-8” + 8 bridge will be the cause of requiring roof mounted cameras on all rental vans and RV’s going forwards!!!
This is modern Earth civilization? They're not ready yet....let check on Neptune
That's next level ignorant. He clearly read the giant flashing sign.
Whoever put that bar there must really know their stuff.
Very deserving.
haha pathetic!
Awww, we didn’t need that stuff on the roof anyway. 🤫
Guess he’ll be needin’ah new one of those….
So.... If 11 foot 8+8=12 foot 4.... I should be fine with a 13 foot height... I'm passing through the area soon and appreciate the video. It's a new motorhome and I'm going on a beautiful vacation!
Why is the bar a foot higher than the edge of the bridge?
NICE JOB 💋
Just put up another sign that says "HEY FOOL THE OTHER SIGN AIN'T LYING "
Oppsy
What gets me every time they go slowly is how incredibly stupid they are. All of us know that they can hear their shit getting wrecked.
He didn’t even stop when he (I guess) heard the first crunches/honks.
So going slower makes the bridge  to raise.? Hmm. Fascinating.
Do they really think slowing down and trying to sneak up under the bridge is going to help? The bridge is not going to magically raise itself up if anything the can opener is going to laugh at you every time
Ahh, made it. See honey, I told you!
Anyone care to guess the cost of fixing that?
So proud of the bridge for getting on the Trending page! Never stop bridge! Never stop! 😂
And just a one-block dogleg turn either direction would have saved all that trouble and money, but so many people have more dollars than sense than is healthy.
What a dip stick, as soon as you hear horns honking just stop and don’t ignore or you are ignorant! Then he didn’t stop to see what he lost!  Ya buddy ignore the horn honking cuz it’s never you that their honking at! LOL pIf I were driving I would have stopped and got out and looked! I don’t care if the horn wasn’t for me, I’d be safe!
100% Represents America's dumb half...........
almost.🤣
The video is nice, but the comment section being overrun with porn spam bots is a turn off... :-(
Can you someone do me a favor and call the mayor of that City and tell him stop being a knucklehead and dig down about 4 ft and who cares if that floods when it when it rains you have a bilge pump just like a boat and it pumps the water out somewhere else but at least you have a small gouge done to that street you can't lift the train tracks but you can go down at least two feet that way this doesn't happen again that is such a I mean easy solution to the stupid problem I don't understand this city that allows that to happen to people's vehicles
THe sign doesn't know where I'm going!
Obviously, a channel subscriber in the grey RAM next to the trailer at :28.  That driver knew what was coming.
Cause going slow stops things from ripping off.
Americans
Oooh~ here she comes. Watch out boys, she'll chew you up! She's a roofeater!
11’-8”+8” says I have awarded from my winter hibernation and I am hungry
Stolen context from official page
As someone who isn't really experienced with RV's -  could someone expain what sorts of things would be in those black nubs that just got smooshed by the bridge?
At this point with adding a sensor, warning sign, AND raising  the bridge I think it's time to have a red flashing stop light drop in front of the lane the vehicle is at. Oh and let's add a loud speaker with a message telling them they're going to be on YouTube if the proceed lol
Why does the sign indicate 12’4” clearance?
There’s literally a sign telling them they’re too tall 🙄 sheesh
I belive those camper a/c's are $3k a pop?  Dude did probably ten grand in damage.
Where is this national treasure located?
Looks like he measured,  but just to the roofline.. and thought he'd be fine.
"If I slow down, maybe the bridge will get taller or my camper will get shorter."
Minutes saved so hours of repair work will be required. So smart.
0:41 Best moment. That piece falling with a clank is a beautiful touch!
I hate that feeling when you know you made a bad choice but you just keep going regardless 😭😂 and pull up I had to see at the mistake u just did
That's going to take a chunk out of the retirement fund. If that isn't the case then you should have bought the accident coverage for rentals. If it belonged to the driver/operator then you might ought to sit down with the owners manual and determine the exact height with air conditioning units at maximum height. Don't know whether to laugh or cry.
I thought he was slowing down to get out to look, oh well, more content for the channel ✌🏽
Well, on the bright side, he'll fit next time.
"Reading is not an option". 😆😆
slow and steady...
I'm retired truck driver it's makes me laugh every time I see a so-called professional truck driver stuck underneath the bridge and then now they're letting them start driving 18 in 3 weeks you can  become a truck driver and they couldn't even spell it when I started so these people pulling their campers around driving their motorhomes around absolutely have no experience and the real kicker is there's not a sticker on the side of the trailer telling how tall it is I like it does a semi trailer they all have a little sticker says 13 6
They thought if they go slow they would rebound off the bar. Unfortunately they skipped that physics lesson.
They did good. Once u start u gotta go through. It was a very close
I swear whoever built that bridge knew what they were doing.
Good rule of thumb: if you feel the need to slow way down cuz you’re not sure you’ll fit, go a different route.
there is a bridge just like this in Zanesville Ohio leading up to the famous Y Bridge , I have been behind 2 trucks that ripped the entire box body off
Why not drop the road height... dig down
I think the nickname for the bridge was the guillotine. I forget where the bride is ho.
Love it! How stupid can you be that you don't know the height of your rig. You obviously  have not physically measured the highest point on your rig or you just don't believe the warning signs.
That bridge is essentially an idiot tax.
in fact he did turn      eventually
Who needs AC anyways
its been a while. almost but not quite.  the trailer cut the corner a tad at the end of it.
Going slower will make my trailer shorter…
If there ever was a special place in hell for bridges! X'D
I hope they dont go to campin world for the repairs lol
🤔 Here's Your Sign 😳
It's a 12' 4" bridge since the last renovations.  No matter I understand them not wanting to change the title of their site.
He didn't know driving faster makes the vehicle flat.
If I EVER become a CDL instructor on a consistent basis, this channel will be my #1 go-to on why you should always keep your rigs height in mind
why is this on trending ?
How do idiots like that make the kind of money it takes to own one of those?
The bridge won't notice if I go slowly
Soon to be listed on craigslist -- a camper for sale. ;)
He tried to pull the sneaky on it
These people can't be NASCAR fans if they were then they would know going faster would be more down force so then they would be lower and maybe only take a inch off and not 6". 🙃😉
Gotta say, the “over height” message and green lights are contradictory. RV drivers are most likely the most clueless about height obstructions.
If the JAWS movie franchise didn’t mind, I think it would be cool to play the violin chord as tall vehicles try to pass under this bridge.
Not quite a feast, but definitely a nibble.
It's baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack!
The slower you go, the more likely it is to fit.
“If I move slowly enough, surely I’ll defy the laws of physics and slip through unscathed!”  Unfortunately, physics shows no mercy to would-be law-breakers.
The honking made it so the driver couldnt hear the crunch because of that he kept going lol.
Maybe if you go really slow the bridge won’t notice you.
Little off the top
They need To LOWER  THE STREET LEVEL PLUS DRAINAGE  !!!!!!! 🛣   30 APRIL 2022, SATURDAY
Slows down just in case he hits bridge,...continues forward after clearly making contact  ripping everything off the top and making sure the roof integrity on that camper is for sure ruined. The stupidity these days nvr ceases to amaze me, seems like the more money they have the dumber they get as well
After initially hitting, he keeps going, causing more damage. A sane person would have STOPPED and got help. What a shit driver.
Oh no ! Ungawa
Death
Her tummy hurts if she eats too fast
if only he inflated the tires a little more, those AC units would also be on the dinner table.
The slow driveaway, with the falling debris, makes this video worth it.
Just a nibble.
Nom nom nom.
*This bridge has a quarter million subscribers and has never verbally told me to press like a subscribe. I wish other YouTubers would follow it's lead. 'cough Corridor cough'*
How hard is taking a measuring tape and measuring the highest point and slapping a sticker on your rear view mirror with that measurement. 🤦‍♂️
As always, thank you.
I was an RV mechanic for 5 years and I remember a gentleman bought a big 5th wheel like that, I don’t remember how far he got but it was only like 250 miles or something and he hit a short overpass so hard it flattened the leaf springs in his brand new truck. Not to mention totaling the trailer!
If we just sneak up…crunch crash!
What is it that makes these drivers keep going forward despite the horn honking and the crunching sounds? Pride? Embarrassment? Shock?
One no more sneaks up on a bridge than one questions the alignment of a gazebo.
Slower does not make it shorter... HA!!!
Just a little off the top please.
Vacation ruined,oh well
T-tops making a comeback in the RV community.
Beautiful!!!
Always proving how stupid people really are.
Why does the sign still say 12' 4' when the clearance to the yellow bar is only 11' 8"?
What an idiot. Slowed down but didn't stop. Now he's famous  too.
Fucking send it
Another brain dead pickup driver
Says I'm to tall but........
Literally a sign, with a sensor, that can tell they are too high, and its FLASHING at them, telling then not to go, and they went anyway.  I hate people.
I am sure the driver is lit, smoking weed and driving not a good mix. Nobody is this stupid.
THEY LITERALLY SAW THE SIGN!!! Wtf! They literally approached knowing it will not fit, then still tried... I literally can not understand that logic
Top 5: Bad Things to be with a RUSSIAN WOMAN... https://youtu.be/YSZ0VvFbu24
When in doubt, don't do it, you'll get bit with a big repair bill.
I guess he didn't need those pieces that were scraped off.
Another bite, keep them coming.
Should have hit it at 88mph the downforce would have saved it, or he would go back in time and not go under he bridge.
"That sign couldn't POSSIBLY refer to me! I AM THE KING OF THE ROAD!"
D'oh!
Find a good reason to replace old equipment on the top.
Not sure who is stupider,  the driver, or the country that allows 11ft8 bridges to exist.
Just a little off the top please.
There was no stopping for this guy. Same destruction. Just slower.
it even tells them he is to tall. what a tool
Not a scratch.
so confused, everyone is talking about 11' 8", which is the name of the link, but the video shows three signs that say 12' 4".  So is it 11'8" or 12'4"?? Why am I an idiot?  EDIT: OK, I went to the website and read the FAQ and it looks like they raised to 12'4" a few years ago.  Got it now.
bridge always hungry must feed
Was having a bad day 😡🤬 until I seen 11 ft by 8 notification ☺️🤗
I'll tell you what the problem is. There's not enough signs. Just put up, like, two more, no one will ever hit that bridge again.
There’s a big swear jar fight going on in the front seats, that’s for sure!
This man even had a flashing digital sign to warn him. Something unseen around my poor areas. Yet he still decided to push his luck. Obviously he probably has money if he can afford that camper so whatever, right? 🤦‍♂️
If you go really slowly, somehow it will be ok. OOPS! 😝
They never learn. There's always one that feels they got it, they can get under it.
Maybe if we drive slow the vents and AC can duck.
"Like a bridge over troubled motors, I will scrape thee down.............."   Art Garfunkel knew what he was singing about, even sixty years earlier!!
If I go slow the bridge won´t notice me
Sounds expensive
I like the way they think that if they drive slowly under the bridge the height restriction will not affect them. 🤣
I've been watching these vids for *years* , and came to one universal conclusion...     ... Driver in *every* vid: "That *doesn't* mean *me*  "... Bridge: "On the contrary"... WHAAAAAM...
Dummy
Does the driver think that slowing down will make the trailer shorter?
Hope that guy has a LOT of money for those repairs. I doubt his insurance will cover STUPID.
Overheight  Must Turn
Now I know why campers leak
I like how everyone is bandwagon talking about this person....with an 11' 8 camper when the sign clearly says 12' 4.... You telling me none of you would be confused? I get the yellow bar is there but the sign doesn't give an accurate height display.....like " overheight 9 feet must turn" it simply says overheight must turn with two signs that clearly say 12' 4...... If your just travelling through and not from the local area ....that would be confusing...
(Driver) “LIKE A GLOVE”
Honey, I thought we bought a trailer with air conditioning?!?
https://youtu.be/VkihoffSRsw
Love it when they see the warning, so just drive really slowly and carefully. Because that's going to make a difference, right? 'Ol bridge probably finds it extra amusing.
How much time would they even save going that way? Is a few minutes worth the thousands it will take to fix that?
Come on, some of the equipment stayed on top of the trailer;)
Can they not read the sign?! Geeze!
YES
Boring 🥱
His day job must be driving for Swift
Lovely !
Note the final nibble at 0:40
Just goes to show you the *proof* that there are rules for some and rules for others.
Why is that trailer that tall in the first place?
Now he’s a YouTube star!😂
I suspect we will be watching flying cars crash into this bridge in another twenty years.
Four months later… worth the wait.
Maybe hang some chain from the 1st yellow bar to make a scraping noise on the roof—then maybe—they back up ?? Naw—not likely!
I get just as excited to see that big yellow bar as I do the bridge in Milwaukee roundabout.
$25K trailer, ten-cent head.
"Nah, I'm 12 foot, 3 15/16 inches, I'm fine!" - That driver.
That right there is God saying "You have entirely too much money and pride, my foolish child. Time for a lesson."
Was waiting for a new vid lol
I hope they're going someplace cold, where they won't need that AC unit …
Instead of "OVER HEIGHT - MUST TURN", the sign should read "YOUR STUPIDITY WILL BE POSTED ON YOUTUBE".
It fit's now !!!!!!
I think it's a pretty bad city to visit or spend money if they don't have even the common sense to fix the bridge so it conforms to Federal standards. I seriously doubt Google maps gps tells anybody about this inferior cities Bridge problem that they can't figure out a fix for and will send you under it if it is an option on your route.
Family on vacation... "Dad, I want to see the 11foot8 bridge!  Ok son, but remember they raised it."
And the drop at the end seals it XD
Just a nibble for the bridge
Yes...going slower will certainly reduce your height!!!!  Anyone this God damn stupid should have their driver's license revoked!!!! Driving is a privilege, not a right people!
As if going slower would help....and of course TURNING after you go under an 11' bridge really helps...... hilarious......
The dummy at the wheel clearly ignored the warnings given by passing drivers on their horns: he must have been a mental-defective (one of those lucky enough to have a million$$ or so in the bank).
I was able to visit the bridge a 4 months ago or so - my life is complete, no regrets.
Every truckers dilemma. Only funnier when a non-CDL driver does this.  Know thy height, know thy weight!
Finally! A new video! The bridge must be really hungry after that long
This guy seemed to know it was coming. Why???
The bridge awakes The bridge hungers The bridge will feed
Keep going? yeah? I'm good? Okay  👍
Ah, another "If I drive very slow, my oversized vehicle can sneak under the bridge" moment.    Or maybe the driver doesn't believe in math and feels the measurements are part of a disinformation campaign 🤷‍♂️
Who approved this bridge design is the real troll of the century.
It must be a former swift driver, lol!
best way to get alk of that crap stiki g out of the roof. much more stream lined now.  good job, your mpg will go up
I skipped breakfast this morning and couldn't help but think that it might have an adverse effect on my day, but then I saw a new video pop up and now feel completely satisfied.
At this point, the bridge is just like SCP. SCP-118+8. No matter how low your vehicle is, this bridge always able to scrape the roof of your vehicle.
Just a little off the top please
If you make something idiot-proof, someone will just make a better idiot.
Lets see, the sign is flashing, people are honking at me, there's no problem with me ignoring everything.
Loud music can do this to your vehicle. "Have you heard that?" >>What?<< "The honking? The screetching" >>It's part of this loud song<< I guess they were listening to death metal.
This is the comic relief that I needed today!
Didn't the light used to turn red if a vehicle was too tall?  Doesn't do any good to sneak up on the bridge if you're not going to stop when you hit it.
"Not to worry, it'll buff right out !"
The idiot even slows down because they know they're too tall.  But they still just go through anyway.
"Hm, yes maybe if I sneak up on the bridge it won't destroy my thousands of dollar A/C on my camper."
Folks - don’t bother honking. Too late anyway, plus - ruins our sacred video!!
They’ll call their insurance to get this paid for. Insurance shouldn’t pay for outright stupidity.
It would be better if the bridge were 10 foot, just so people wouldn't be over confident.
I see his "car" and he gets what he fucking deserves
Hire a full time traffic cop. It would actually be worth it.
Passenger: Do you think it hit, thought I heard something. Driver looks out his mirror: Naw, didn’t see anything, it’s all good.
How do they not know what's on top of their camper?
Another one bites the dust.....but I am amazed people still haven't learned their lesson
Physics. Going slower makes things shorter.
Oh come on! Clearly it was the fault of the other drivers, who woke up the bridge with their honking while the camper was silently sneaking through.
I feel like the sign needs to be changed. I can see where someone not familiar with the area can take that as just "If you're overheight, you must turn" because they don't know that it actually measures the vehicles and is actually saying "YOU'RE Overheight and YOU Must Turn!" Obviously you can't say that much but MAYBE you can make it say... "YOU'RE OVERHEIGHT TURN NOW" or something like that? Although that doesn't work well with two lines as the first  two words are MUCH longer...
Slowing down won't help.   I've missed this bridge so much.
Come on. More than 50% made it through.
Always remember, "MUST TURN" is just a suggestion, from people who definitely don't know your vehicle or cargo as well as you do.
So excited - I clicked on right away! I was just here last weekend thinking there would be no more entrrtainment!
This is one of my favorites since they were getting honked at.
Every once in a while a reminder that Darwin was right is refreshing.
He thought he could sneak up on it but The Can Opener is always awake and watching.
The Rockwood Wrangler strikes again
What's the mentality there?  "Well it might take me a few minutes and some embarrassment to safely back up, guess I'll just floor it and cause a few thousand dollars of damage" 🤡
Happy new year! It’s great to be back!
Ignorance at it's finest ... Sign says overheight must turn: from the Cabin  "I say Richard I think that flashing sign might be for us? Seriously Joyce I know what I'm doing I'll just crawl through she'll magically settle down & we'll be OK." "Damn Joyce listen to that Clown on our right honking haha what a tool." "Richard what's that noise?" Richard *"Bugger she's taller than I thought if only it was marked better I'd of gone around it 🤷‍♂️"*
"Let's just go real slow so if we hit the crash bar, we can stop before we do much damage." [CRUNCH] "But what do we do after we hit it?" "I don't know." "Me either."
Yep. Still got it after all these years.
After so many months without incident the bridge litterally gulped all the good stuff.
Did he think he could sneak up on it?
Ah yes, the ol' sneaky-deaky
Looks like Joe Biden must have been driving. Clearly written signs and still can't comprehend.
The bridge is still hungry for its snacks!
And the bride wins again!
part of me wonders if the people who "ignore the warning signs" are actually good somaritans trying to keep a hungry can-opener fed, with how many there are
i've worked overheight incident for a DoT.  the usual reaction to tearing up their 5th wheel or RV is "where's the nearest dealer?"  they just go out and buy and install new stuff--zero responsibility.
Guess the giant flashing lights telling you to turn because your too high isn’t enough for some people 🤣
- Hears cracking noises and horns; - Yeah I'm gonna keep acceleraring, all is well if I ignore everyone.
Just about the time I forget about this channel, it brightens my day again
Ok. Im confused. The sign says 12'8". What am I missing?
just a nibble
take all the signs down except the height sign and let it play out
Been a min glad to see ppl are more aware of this now
they usually come in 2s heres hoping anyways
They should put some sort of digital sign to let people know that they are too high.....oh wait.
Ooooh the can opener got a snack!!!
Bridge just ate 1 AC, 2 power vents, 1 satellite/tv antenna system
"Honey, see that sign, maybe we should turn."
Phone navigation voice: "Good one! Now back up and do it again" 😈
That was a tease!
It blows my mind how motorists do not pay attention to road signs or take into account how tall their vehicles are! It's like how toll booth entrances to the turnpike don't have white lines and people just completely lose their ability to properly navigate into and out of the booths! Let's not forget how many people don't know that a broken stoplight turns into a stop sign!
If I go slow enough I can squeeze under it better. there wont be as much damage
Yay! My favorite bridge is back in action again.  (The best part is that "CRUNCH" at the end when the last piece of debris hits the pavement. 😃
Didn't need those anyway, right?
There is no stopping stupid…  Even if they slow down to a crawl. 🤣🤣🤣
It’s okay he went slow, that always works…
Even my wife comes to look when its these clips. Here past covid more people will be out and about, new truck drivers too, so it'll pick up again.
I was just thinking it was a while since something hit and now this turns up, freaky.
I wish I had that kind of money to be able to buy a nice big camper and abuse the crap out of it like that.  They obviously don't care about what they own to ignore the big flashing sign telling them that they're overheight or the people next to them trying to warn them.
It's about time. The poor bridge must be starving.
Just wanted to make it a thousand comments
Did they not let you put the second camera back up?
The old "sneak up on it" technique. Never fails... to fail.
Idiot probably voted for Trump Too!
Let the canopener season start!
The bridge always wins!!!
She has awoken from hibernation.
Can you say TOTAL
Try stealth
When you first hear the scrape I don't understand not stopping and reversing
I think that flashing message meant "Turn  B E F O R E  The Bridge, IDIOT!"
Maybe they should add a sign: "YOUTUBE IS WATCHING"
Yet another example of the "maybe if I go real slow, the bridge won't catch me" strategy.
Ah, the "maybe the bridge won't notice me if I sneak up on it" technique. Never gets old.
Wart head  doesn't  hear  horns
I'm sure this driver was crouching down in their seat thinking it would make the vehicle fit 😂
Well..they still have the one good air.
They could raise it another 8 inches, we'll just make taller trucks.   The bridge needs to feed.
man. is it so hard to dig a little deeper and solve this issue once and for all?! no matter what there will always be this idiot who ignores the signs. don't get me wrong, it never gets old. ha
Just a stupid stupid stupid person.  You're at a stop light - with bright white flashing LED's telling you you are too high to proceed and yet you still do.  People....
Just when I'm starting to think once again that life is terrible, after my Mom has a stroke. What?! Another upload?! I swear to almighty fuck, these videos give me life and keep me going.
I will simply never understand why people think that driving slowly lowers the height of the bridge. It's not a deer hunt, creeping up on it doesn't increase your chances of success.
Time to stop by Walmart and buy a tarp.
I hope this portends a wonderful meal to come 😋
It's ok...Not his trailer. He borrowed it from his mother-in-law
Just a trim..😐😑🤔🤓
The 5th wheel convertible.
So satisfying watching the bridge feeding...
That there is one of them fancy French/Italian trucks with an inept driver
"That sign can't possibly apply to me, I'm not over height"
Always amusing to see them try to slow crawl their way under, as if it will save them like someone sucking their stomach in.
I do not understand why an Attorney has not filed a Class Action Lawsuit and sued the blithering pants off this city. It is undeniable that the city knows they have a problem that is damaging people's property and their remedy is not working. These videos go back years and it would be a slam-dunk easy payday.
The best part is that he knows he's overheight, so he goes slower.
They should have never tried to fix this bridge, this is a source of endless entertainment.
Dang that hurts
Rumor has it if you sneak up on the bridge you gain 6" of clearance!
The bridge has awoken
Winner Winner, chicken dinner!
Truly fascinating to watch so much stupidity.
Reminds me of the RV in National Lampoon's Christmas vacation after Clark Griswold got through with it.
Of all the channels I subscribe to - I click on these new ones the fastest. Gotta see the bridge's latest victim.
Peer pressure- The guy honking sent him over the edge. Should have just reversed
Why risk it 🤦🏻‍♂️
"Maybe physics won't work if I just go reaaaally slow?"
It's ALIVE .. ALIVE
You know, if he went just a little bit slower, he would've cleared it.
There are so many warnings approaching the bridge.  Obviously this guy KNEW it was debatable whether he'd fit, or he wouldn't have slowed down.  Still, I equate this madness of Bridge Death Match with folks that drive around the deployed crossing barricades at RR tracks . . .
Talk about dumb and dumber just kept going after being warned, and in any case, if he was not sure why to keep going it never ceases to amaze me how dam stupid these people are.
It's amazing how people so dumb still somehow manage to get driver's licenses.
Were they going extra slow to be sneaky?
The bridge is back for some spring time fun!
if you sneak up on the bridge it won't notice you
There should be a sign on the other side of the bridge that says "Haha. That flashing sign was for you, idiot".
god people in this town are straight brain dead i swear
To quote Yondu: "That guy was a jackass!"
No matter how many people blow their horn to tell them to stop, they keep on driving.
Weird how no one ever comes from the other side
Crazy, I was just thinking about this channel the other day!
Those things are super cheap to repair. Suck it up hunny, no A/C this year.
Is this bridge in Burlington, NC?
'tis but a scratch
The bridge awakens from winter slumber.
I wish someone would open up the "My trailer, My roof, My choice" repair shop on the other side of the bridge.
I kinda wish they never raised it
I like how he tries to sneak up on it. Nope! Gottem
CSX needs to start using these videos to get the plate numbers and fine these people. Think of how much money the railroad had to spend because people can’t read.
It’s been a while
Eeeh, you don't need those.
Still waiting for that sign to say "told ya" after impact
He didn't need them extra bits. Feels more airy now.
I like it when they do it slowly, thinking somehow it’ll help squeeze through better.
Food for the bridge gods!!!!
If you go slow enough your vehicle gets shorter!
Nailed it!
It's more aerodynamic now :-)
Anybody know what any of that junk on top of the RV actually is?  Is it a fan, air outlet or something?
Just noticed the "Rikers Island" appearing top-right of the Patreon link in the end card. Anyone know why that is there?
Starting to think that attention seekers are purposefully wrecking their cars
Like Ron White says, “Ya can’t fix Stupid!”
Litterbug!
Was quiet past months here
Mmmmm so slow sooooo good
just another day at the old 11foot8+8 bridge
On my birthday! Finally!
This reminds me so much of trying to teach my kindergartener what "being careful" actually means.
What do insurance companies do about this?
You can't fix stupid.
Don't tease the bridge! 🤣
The other drives tried to warn him.
If I drive slow enough maybe the bridge won't notice...
the guy knew he fucked up immediately since he slowed down right at the bridge so he knew he probably was not gonna make it under the bridge but once the first unit on the roof got crushed he had to stay committed and keep going lmao
So glad you're back. A classic sneak attack.
The ACs made it, the vent fans didn’t!
The honker, "HEY! HEYYYYYYYYY!!!!!! You're not gonna make it!!!!!!!!!" But ......
He thought he could make it. But to quote Max Smart: He missed it by that much" from the old Get Smart TV show. That's for all those that never got to see TV back when it was good, without all this PC and reality/drama junk. In fact this 11'8+8 bridge is far more entertaining than TV today and I look forward for the videos!
ah yes, serotonin
What part of "OverHeight Must Turn" do these idiots not understand?
It takes a special kind of stupid to pull that off.  Approach slowly knowing you're at risk and still proceeding slowly after making contact..  SMH
Why do people continue to follow through once they realize their oversized trailers won't fit?
Hey … he will make it the next time, no problemo!!! 👏👏👏👏👏
Je comprend pas le video ...... Deux panneaux indique clairement 12 pi et 4 po. Et dans le video on insère un pictogramme de 11pi et 8 po....... Alors que je sais que mon VR mesure 11pi et 4po. (avec la hauteur des auvents et air clim) et que je vois  deux panneaux indiquant 12pi et 4 po, je serais dans la même situation que lui !
When the sign says 12' it should be 12'. Not 11'8". I can see why this is a thing  😂
I live in Durham, and I’ve seen The Bridge…it’s marked VERY clearly from both directions. There is no way somebody can miss the warnings. Anyone who does either isn’t paying ANY attention or they just like to “live dangerously”!
You can almost hear the driver saying "Nah, don't worry, we got this honey!"
Ah yes, the classic:  “Maybe if I sneak up on the bridge it won’t notice”
A man stands by his decisions, and keeps going no matter what. Big respect.
11FOOT8+8 BRIDGE: YOUR STUPID TRUCK WITH CAMPER TRAILER: NO I'M NOT TRUCK WITH CAMPER TRAILER: "CRASHES INTO THE 11FOOT8+8 BRIDGE AND LOSES THE COOLING FANS ON THE TRAILER" 11FOOT8+8 BRIDGE: YES YOU ARE
I hope this is the start of a prolific season for the bridge.
I guess a detour was going to take too much time? LOL!
Well that looked expensive.  To be fair though, the lights were green.
the way the camera is means there is no sense of depth
You got to love the commitment
Yes, if you go SLOWER, it will reduce your vehicle height by a couple inches…or maybe not! 🤣
29APR2022 - DANG!  FINALLY!  I was jonsing bad and you delivered. See, idiots do have a place in this world.
Been a long time between drinks. For more entertainment in the meantime, hop on over to https://youtube.com/c/MilwaukeeRoundabout to watch the oil pan eating kerbs.
*mmmm air vents yumb yumb*
That was a squeaker.  Little air out of the tires might have done the trick.
That has to be one of the dumbest ones ever.
Could have saved the rear AC unit if the driver listened to the other cars/trucks on the road.
Saw how the A/C unit (?) landed on the road ... should'nt the driver get a ticket for illegal waste disposal? Considered the NASA got one from some hicksville in Australia (Balladonia) of 400 Dollars because of littering, after they got the burning remains of skylab, big as a house, right on their heads?
Just gets better and better.
Most underrated channel on YT
Oh, Bridge is alive. Made my day! :)
ive never seen some one use their horn to warn some one before, but the guy in the black truck tried his hardest
You could stick a person guarding it all day long and people would still drive under this bridge.
It’s been a long time since the last one. They need to take the warning sign down so we can get more videos.
Whatever, that Camper didn't need those parts that fell off.
Not sure what's funnier, the latest victim or the Patreon link that popped up that has actual patrons. -Earth 2022
he slowed down and clearly realised what was happening, yet he still kept going  the nerve some people have..
“I’ll take it slow we’ll fit”  “I dunno…I seen this bridge on YouTube and we ain’t gonna fit”   “See we fit! We don’t need those black boxes on the top anyways”
Nice.
If you go slow the bridge can't see you and you'll slide right under it.
Why do people insist that they, some how, some way, are going to be *the one* that all the signage and so forth are lying to?
It's kind of embarrassing that the guy with the RV trailer knew enough to slow right down where actual commercial drivers usually hit the bridge at full speed. Lol
A gift from the lord!
If I go slow The bridge won't know Hehehehe. Oh shh****
Might as well get them all.
Must have been a rental.
These always make me smile
never seen anyone turn left after going under bridge and destroying stuff
The whole “moving slowly so the bridge doesn’t see you” act doesn’t work
Well AC was overrated when camping anyway.
Gotta love the “if I sneak up it probably won’t notice” technique!
If a flashing sign saying, "OVER HEIGHT-- MUST TURN" & hearing your vents/ac units, etc being scraped off the top don't deter you from attempting this bridge, I dunno what to tell ya, bud.
You would think the idiot would know the overall height of his camper trailer . good to see the bridge still  the boss...
Bit of an optical illusion there! Thought he almost had it!
Yeah just drive slowly, that'll somehow lower your height.
Sir David Attenborough:  And now that spring has come, a Pontis Hydria-aperta emerges from hibernation.  The CanOpener Bridge ventures forth in search of nourishment to replenish the fat upon which it relied for the last several months.    A hapless Casa Caravanous sees too late it has strayed near the den.  In an effort to avoid becoming a meal, the Caravan attempts to creep away.  Alas, it has been seen and becomes the first of many morsels the Bridge will need to survive another year.
Another bites the dust
Well, that went well.
I’ve seen the bridge in person
I love how one of the other vehicles tries to warn him which gets completely ignored.
always love seeing an upload 😂
He almost did the right thing and stop.
I was hoping for some serious shearing off the AC units like others have done, still good seeing the nibbler in action.
Gotta love these vids, they never go stale 😊
I love the ones where they keep going forward, despite everything. At some point, these drivers think "Surely, all the flashing lights and signs aren't referring to ME, it must be some OTHER over height vehicle".
Always I have a discussion about if humankind already got its evolutive peak I use this channel as evidence.
"Warning says *STOP* ,but if I go through vewy vewy slowly..."
Whyyyyy would you keep going after the initial crunch!? Isn't that the whole point of the sneak in approach!?
I love it when they try to sneak through
Honey they always have a margin of error build in for snow it more like 13,7 You were saying dear
Well, that took long enough. Welcome back to the can opener!  :-)) Creeping thru does not help.
I want pistons up there. Sticky pistons with 1 tick clock..
The slower, the lower.
We missed you! Which is more that that vehicle did to the bridge.
The sign don’t lie.  It will trim you down to the correct size.
Gotta love it when people neglect to heed warning signs or signs in general. But hey, that’s why this bridge remains fed after all. Lol.
The bridge hasn’t had a meal in awhile. Glad it got fed!
The old sneak up and it won't notice manoeuvre...
There is a huge flashing "OVERHEIGHT MUST TURN" sign that the driver sees and decides to go through anyway.
This popped up and my day got just a little bit brighter.
man.  I think he lost a satty dish and a TV antenna.  I guess he will have to actually talk to the wife tonight.
Somewhat uneventful,  but good to see some fresh activity!😁
Well somebody's not watching TV tonight. 😸 Oh and the vent covers are easily replaced. Maybe $40 a piece.
no big deal, you don't need that stuff on top.  it's just for show, they do absolutely nothing.  just hunks of junk on top.  no purpose whatsoever, not expensive at all to fix....why not just drive right through it.  hell, i play grand theft auto and do it, so why not.
"Damn it Ron"
This just made my week!  Thought the bridge was on a diet, but I see it's still HUNGRY!  LOL 😆 🤣
Sorry kids the camping trip is canceled before we could get there because dad is stupid!
why do people think going slower will make them smaller..
Another one bites the dust
The classic move slowly so the bridge won't notice me, never works for them but also never fails to entertain us.
they still must think that "overheight" sign desn't apply to them. me overheight? naw it must be that invisible vehicle in the other lane!
The ac delete. Great mod.
I don't understand. How are these people able to survive, like in general?
Summer is in the air and under the bridge.
I like how it looked like he was being super cautious at first, but then made contact and cars around him even started honking, and he was still like "FTW I'm still going. ;P"
Bless the truck driver on the right who appeared to be slamming their horn to try to warn the camper driver, albeit too late and still unheeded.
I love the person honking, I'm imagining they're doing it to let the people behind them know, "GET IN THE RIGHT LANE, AN OUT OF TOWNER HIT THE BRIDGE AGAIN"
The detor route must be hell :)
Brilliant, just a nice little snakette for the bridge
Well he can look at it this way now, on the trip back home he meets the clearance requirements! LOL
I love how this driver *knows* he’s not gonna make it but keeps going anyway. Even as he can hear pieces of equipment being shorn off, he just keeps going. Don’t any of these people watch YouTube?
"Honk! Honk!"  😂
they need to make the sign neon pink or something that will trigger epilepsy in the drivers and MAYBE that way they will stop . . .
I sure miss seeing these every month like before!
I thought he makes it for a second, then I remembered why I was so excited for a new vid from this channel in the first place xD
Ah yes, another fine day at the bridge! :)
We need to see a good can opener.
time to feed the bridge troll again...
Ought to be a repair shop set up right across from that bridge.
"Just a little off the top, please..." 😀
we have to acknowledge that driver's determination, if nothing else
Clark Griswold : I know what I’m doing Ellen .
They should install ballasts in front of the bridge. If the idiot tries, the ballasts will immediately pop up. Then there will be ballast accidents with the idiot trying to drive around them.
those things that fell off the trailer probably wasn't needed since driver totally ignored the fact he lost them
Bridge:  " I want something crunchy.  Just a snack tho."
Totally oblivious to the honking, and oblivious to the damage…until they get the bill
Sign : Must Turn. Driver : OK soon as I get under this bridge.   Wt@#$$$$
I should buy the property in that open lot they all pull into and start a trailer in a RV repair business
this channel has the same energy as #Drumbeats (GTOger)
There absolutely has to be a perfect ratio of slowing down just enough that the bridge grows. We haven't found it yet but the people will never stop trying to find it.
good that people actually bothered trying to tell him, but you can’t fix stupid
Once on exercise in Germany as a Squadron Warrant Officer I visited one of our Troop COMCEN sites in a big wood.  Whilst there and because the exercise was ending the Troop OC asked me to lead a packet of HGV Radio Relay vehicles back to camp, which I agreed to do.  The problem came that the designated exit track for the HGVs was different to the entry track I had come in by and it went off my maps so I was immediately lost.  However knowing that turning left would lead down to a river with a major road heading back to camp and back onto my maps I duly turned left.  This road was quite narrow and we descended down a steep road towards the river.  Of course, not only was the road I wanted to join following the river, but also parallel to it a railway line, so inevitably just before the road was a low narrow arched railway bridge.  Now I was stuck, the Radio Relay wagons could not fit under the bridge because of the mast mounted on the back, the road was too narrow to turn in and, unusually because it was the end of exercise, the RR trucks were towing 10kVA generators, so could not reverse up the hill.  At this point one of the older Detachment Commanders came up to me and said that he had in the past been able to get under a low bridge by unhitching the top bracket of the mast, and lowering it to an oblique angle just enough for it to clear the bridge by a rope held by a crewman lying on the roof of the truck.  This worked a treat, the only problem was the bridge was right on the main road so as each truck came through it had to set off into traffic immediately.  I cannot remember if they all free ran back to camp from there or I gathered them together at a lay by, whatever the day was saved!
Do you feel lucky, punk?
I love it. Here is what the driver was thinking. "I know my trailer is too tall, but maybe if I go slow enough, that will lower the height of the trailer." Taking a 6 figure 5th wheel and causing thousands of dollars in damage because you didn't want to take a detour? What a waste...
The stupidity never ceases to amaze me. Warm wishes from Minnesota!
Slow motion peel. Classic!
🙄hm, ...🙄Isn't it (the same guy already smashed onece his trailer AC (earlier) crash #132 (crash #158) … okay paint wrap on RV is different 😑
Always bring me a smile
It’s clearanced for next time!
Some things never change
I love how the overheight sign was like "Alright, good luck then" and stopped flashing.  🤣
The bridge is back!!
Probably wouldn’t do it again after finding out the damage.
Sneakin up on the bridge but forgot to hit crouch
Man, this would have really been a fun one if the bridge was 8 in shorter still.
a small appetizers before the next great meal
Nice finally another video
"The bridge won't see me if I go slow enough."
"Well, now I'm comitted"
Remember, if you go slow enough the bridge might not notice you're going under it.
Fuck that sign.  I wont do what it tells me.  Oh shit, my trailer is fucked up...  Stupid bridge.
Ah yes, the "If I move slower, then I am obviously smaller" tactic.
At least he was careful.
Hmm... a five-minute detour or hours and hundreds of dollars in repairs? Hard choice!
Well done Bridge!
I thought the AC was coming off...
Some mofos out there thinking a stealth approach will boost their stats, make them level up, and allow them to defeat the 11' 8" boss once and for all.
"Maybe if I drive slower, my car will get smaller."
Not like those things on top of the trailer serve any real purpose anyway
Some people think they can sneak past the physics.
I like how they think going slower will help
I palm faced before it even happened...
This has probably been asked and answered at this point, but if they have something that can detect and warn an over-height vehicle, why can't they tie that into the stop light?  The light would stay red until the over-height vehicle is no longer detected (ie, turned another way).
I love how he approaches slowly, then the first one gets knocked off and he keeps going
He just kept on going. No crunching metal or cars honking was gonna stop him. He had places to be!
They gotta change that flashing sign. "Overheight must turn" isn't specific enough, and can be considered a general warning to any overheight vehicle. "YOU are overheight, YOU must turn" directs the sign's meaning to the viewer, instead of being a general "if your vehicle is overheight, you gotta turn" warning.   At least, that's how one would hope it would work in a perfect world. But when you make something foolproof, nature creates a better fool.
The one piece falling off with a clunk was the icing on the cake :D
I was starting to worry, the bridge hasn’t been fed in awhile
Just take a little off the top.   11'8"- I got you fam
I don't think the dealership is going to cover that under warranty😂
Welcome back, I was starting to get worried :)
Nope. Attempting to sneak under the bridge doesn't work. Although it does reduce the noise level of the bridge eating.
Almost tantric. That slow pull through.
Truly no cure for stupid
People this stupid somehow have jobs that can pay for a $70,000 fifth wheel and a $55,000 truck.
First car: Beep beep beep beep, 2nd car.. beep beep beeep....I'll just ignore both of these people and keep driving....what an idiot.
Nein! Nein! Nein! Das darf doch alles nicht wahr sein! 😯🙄😯
It's amazing how many people can't read.
This bridge is becoming the last bastion of objective truth. #BullCity
There are NEVER enough signs for those that dont want to read or pay attention.
I need to stop by this place.
The physical manifestation of The Invisible Hand.
The bridge gods must have sacrifice....crunchy crunch crunch...
How much does it cost to repair and replace that damage?.. maybe next time he will turn and go around that 🤷🏻😅
i mean at least they didn't lose AC units, just vent covers and Tv antena..
A snack for the beast!
It must be really hard to find another way around to avoid this garbage disposal.
Warning signs: they must be referring to someone else. *CRUNCH*: that can't possibly be me. Other drivers furiously honking: is this a local tradition, to honk as you pass under?  2 + 2 + 2 = 0
Have a great holiday!
it was about time LOL
If you listen closely you can hear the driver saying. "I think I can, I think I can, I think iiiiiiiiiiii can."
I was hoping the bridge would still get eat once in a while
He even thought about it and still powered thru
Can opener still alive and hungry
The moving company guys are going camping
It returns!  I never understand anyone’s aversion towards just turning and taking a detour when they clearly don’t know if they’re going to fit or not.
they always keep on going bro
What's the definition of insanity, again?
Those drivers are honking their horns for a reason bub. Once you start hearing that crunching noise, just stop! lol  Ah well, you can't fix stupid!
Even as the equipment begins to peel off, backing up was never an option for this guy.
At last, after 3 months starving diet !!!
I would like to see how hanging an opaque black/grey sheet (metal, wood, cloth, cement, doesn't matter) down from the bridge. I actually think this could solve the entire thing on its own. This should make the bride look lower than it actually is and prevent truck drivers from even considering if they would fit, as it would look like actually driving into a wall from their perspective. Thoughts?
Ah the ole sneak up on the bridge tactic lmfao
Always the morons who think they can outsmart the mighty bridge by going slowly.
Hahahahah
It's so funny when people just go through slowly and hope that won't damage their vehicle too much
THE BRIDGE STRIKES AGAIN! UNDEFEATED!!
This warms my heart
If you don't fit, don't commit.
What a yahoo
Look at how much the driver slowed down. They weren't sure if they could clear the bridge. If you weren't sure, why wouldn't you just choose a different route? Why take the chance?
Only if that truck was going faster. It would’ve did more damage. It’s been a while since the bridge has been fed.
Love the speed. You can see the driver knew it wouldn't fit 😏
“Maybe if I go juuuuust slow enough…..” -That driver, probably
Juuuust missed.
That's what you get for speeding, lesson learned.
...and he kept going.
You just KNOW the driver was ducking their head hoping to squeeze under... Lol
adorable attempt to not being noticed by the bridge
Oh thank the Darwin Gods people are still to stupid to obey the sign.  Have been going through withdrawal without my bridge fix.
Ignorance costs money
That sign has got to be a lie!  Rhut-rho 😩
I completely forget the existence of this channel till every so often i get the notification that the bridge has claimed another victim. This truly is the perfect channel to ring the bell for.
Well can opener say hello camper trailer Iam going to destroy this camper trailer. This keep going knowing his camper trailer is getting destroyed. Ignored people honking
They did read the sign, just didn't realize they needed to turn before the bridge, not after.
For those who dont understand  hiw this works, you go slow so you can look up and see if you will fit and you listen for   sounds that you hit the bridge, then , if you hit the bridge, and this is the part thar confuses everyone, you stop and back up. It's  like forcing your feet into shoes that are too small.  Your feet wont get smaller and the shoes won't stretch, so you find a larger pair of shoes . Or, in this case, find a taller bridge.
Who needs Maxi vent covers and a digital TV antenna anyway.🤣
If you go slow enough, the bridge can't see you.
Can we start putting points on peoples licenses for hitting the bridge? If you're that stupid I don't want you driving.
Let’s hope that “things happen in threes” holds true again!
When people do this it makes me think of The Office when Michael Scott refuses to think critically and follows the GPS by driving into the lake.
Next time you need a haircut, stand at just the right height on the back of a truck and there ya go lol
Gotta pay the toll
Like a siren, she beckons for men to steer their ships towards destruction.
I will always shake my head at the drivers that somehow think changing their driving speed (whether to go slower or faster) will positively affect the outcome.    Also, that so many drivers think the 'over height must turn' message is not aimed at their over height vehicle/trailer.
It was graceful though.
A light appetizer
Somehow I feel like the dude honking was saying exactly what I was thinking.
Slower is not lower.
This is how you know you have way too much money, when you hear the crunching and you just keep driving your million dollar motorhome
That guy made a business decision there, back up and be uncomfortable or possibly have to replace everything on his roof, he chose the latter
Here's a solution. Lower the bridge to a standard truck height. Absolutely no clearance for any box truck/trailer... This way, they won't even try to crawl under the bridge. Must go around.
Nice its back! Is the longest dry streak we've had since the bridge been raised?
I bet they thought they cleared it🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
perfect example of going slower doesnt make you smaller lol
Why are there 500 comments on this video when I don't get any??
After 4 months the bridge has returned. This time with a special.
This and the Width Restriction channel in the UK need to cross promote.
I see they got smart and turned the light green for overhight vehicles to prevent them from flooring it to beat the light
What a way to ruin your vacation 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
When will they learn? Sneaking up on the bridge does not work.
I love this bridge. Psychologists should study these videos... maybe therin is the secret of life the universe and everything.
Amazing. People never learn.
Some drivers just have nothing going on in their head XD
I feel like the slow, drawn out meals are better than the fast, destructive gorges.
The trick is to go real slow
Bridge always gets its cut.
On a dark day the can opener delivers a ray of sunshine!
Do people really think they can make their vehicle smaller by driving slower?
Overheight - must turn. I wonder who they mean? ;)
The little crunches was the sound of the repair bills ringing up one at a time
That piece falling at the very end  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The bridge must feed.
TRAILER SNACK YUMMMMMMY       Weed Me
THE KING HAS RETURNED
Clearly we just need camper convertables.
The canopener finally had lunch. A small one, but still!
Another one bites the dust. You can not argue with her.
It must have been the lighting and shadows but at first it looked like he was going to make it.... then he didn't :-)
A bridge has the right to defend itself like any other citizen of this great any mighty nation. 🇺🇲🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Good. More!
🤦🏽‍♂️ at least he has one A/C left
Sign: “OVERHEIGHT MUST TURN” Driver: “Do you know who I am?”
It's been awhile now, since the bridge enjoyed a lil' snack, lol!!
She's back!
😃 Great to see u back!! 🥰
Problem was likely that he knew that his trailer would fit - he just didn't think of his AC etc.
I like how as he makes the left turn to the "penalty box" the pieces slowly fall off.
Bravo! Bravo! How refreshing!!!!!
It has been a long winter... Even though it's a small nibble, this shall suffice until the next feast
Many people think the horn honking was them warning the driver to stop, but I wonder if the horn honking was from people annoyed that he went so slow in the left lane? I live within 100 miles of that bridge, so I wouldn't be surprised to hear drivers acting like that instead of a honk for a warning.
some people cant be helped..
It's almost little bit sad that these crashes have gotten less frequent and more tame. It's so entertaining to watch the big ones!
Didn't expect him to keep driving after he first made contact 😅
Ah how painful it must be to be that driver. That's gonna be an expensive repair bill
How about an audible alarm that says “hey dumbass, doesnt matter how slow you go your still overheight”
The camper even slows down because it realizes that the bridge is low and still drives through it! The bridge truly has some sort of appeal to vehicles too tall to pass under.
*Only a nibble...still hungry!*
Driver to RVshare host: “You rented it to me like that.”
My favorite YouTube channel has uploaded again. A small treat today
I could hear the driver and his navigator arguing about whether to turn or not, seeing the signage, trying to understand that their 5th wheel was about to get a shave and a haircut (albeit expensive).  I'd say, about $8,000 - $10,000 damages, and the delays in getting the replacement parts! Ouch.
10,000 views in the first hour 👍  Sadly the driver doesn't seem to understand the concept of towing something big + going under something very low + horns blaring to get his/her attention.
This fool took some extra time to think, yet still made the wrong decision! 🤣
As he pulls away and the shit is falling off the top he's telling his wife, See I told you it was fine.
As someone else said, this never gets old!
If only there were something that could warn the driver ahead of time that they are over height and should not go under the bridge, but turn instead… 🧐🤔
"If I go really, really slow maybe it won't damage my camper."
Try again, you missed the last a/c.
On the plus side it's no longer overheight.
Maybe if I go slow enough...
He tried the sneaky approach. If I go slow enough maybe the bridge will magically rise up an extra foot 🤔
Who would win in a fight, 11”8 or Milwaukee roundabout
Looks like they repaved this road since last time.
11foot8+8 Bridge: Finally some good f**king food
Never gets old...
The "Plop" on the road at the end made me burst out laughing.
"Heh heh heh, not a scratch!"
Ah yes, the old sneak-up-on-the-bridge-and-it-won't-notice-you technique.  Classic.
Ahh yes, another satisfying video of parts falling off a vehicle.
Driving a bigger vehicle doesn't mean having a bigger brain.
If you are going to go THAT slow under a bridge you might as well just make sure to get out and check your friggin clearance. Screw traffic.
How munch is that in metric?
"Surely that blinking sign applies to plebs." Why would you keep going?
JESSE WHAT WAS THAT
If I go slow enough, it might not notice me!!!  THE BEAST FEEEEDS!
Hey, greetings from Poland :) Love your channel. We have A place here in Gdańsk on Hallera Street with similar height and accident story ;)
00:43 That piece hitting the ground just cracks me up.
Ah, the old "sneak up on the bridge" strategy. The bridge. Never. Sleeps.
I still miss the old days, 30 miles per hour and peel the top
Question for everyone, since all of the warnings are posted and you ignore them and drive under bridge and  damage your vehicle does your private insurance still cover damages for your stupidity?
I swear 80% of people shouldn't be on the road...
the bridge claims another soul
I Iove how a trailer like that is described as a "camper". I wonder how the occupants would cope with real camping? Probably transfer to a 5 star hotel the next night to recover from the trauma.
What's your problem? What are you honking at?  Um, nothing. Have a good day taking your 13 foot rig under the 12' - 4" bridge. 😂🤣😂🤣😂
If you drive slow towards the bridge, you won’t hit it.
Hello old friend.  It is so good to see you again.
Eventually we'll need to circulate a petition for an 11 foot 8 plus 16 bridge because people ain't ever gonna learn
Might as well be a toll bridge cause its gonna cost you $$$$
балбес знаки не видет
They need to put drop down wigwags or pop up barriers with stupid proof signs YOU WILL NOT FIT, YES YOU.
Another one bites the dust
Oh... They definitely saw all the warnings...
Maybe it should have the words "YOU ARE" at the beginning.
That will be an expensive fix.
They did turn eventually. It was after the bridge, but credit where credit is due 🤣
He know he couldnt make it but kept going. Lol
I love the sound of bridge feeding in the morning.
I've seen the sign, but maybe if I drive very slow, I will be lower ........
Thats gonna be expensive to fix....
O dear........ 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Love it, thank you 👍👍👍
Would it not had been cheaper to go around?
He regrets the last time he got those tyres inflated
Numb nuts
Поступил мудро, отсёк всё лишнее.
They could put a wall up and someone would think they could get through
"Overheight, must turn" *More what you'd call guidelines than actual rules*  "Man, all these people must be honking because they think my camper's cool!"
The honking pickup wasn’t to warn the RV, it was saying hello to YouTube.
I was just thinking last night that the bridge must be starving. Glad to see it got a snack.
I was just wondering a couple of days ago: "I wonder if the 11ft 8 bridge has been fed yet". Thanks camper van. 🤣
You would think that nowadays it would be cheap enough to have a device that will tell a driver that his vehicle is over the height limit.
Slow and steady does not win the race.
It's gonne be a good day!!!
The bridge needs a water curtain that flows when an overheight vehicle is detected, with the word "STOP" in big letters projected on it.
great video
That horn sounded like it was saying JackAss.
Least this guy made it through, haha
The snapping turtle strikes again lol
Title should've been "Camper trailer 'slowly' loses equipment..." Also, what happened to the other camera? I bet that angle is as enjoyable as this one.
The bridge feast agian
Lol he thought he going slower will reduce the height 🤣
If you go slowly enough, the bridge won't hear you, and you'll emerge unscathed.
More money than sense
Nice! 👍
He tried to pull a sneaky but the bridge was too hungry
"Maybe if I go slow, the bridge won't notice me"
Very expensive F__k up
That bridge is famous even where I live, thousands of miles away... 🤗
Rule #1 - Going slower, does not make your rig shorter
Thats more understandable as they are not used to heights and low overhangs. The commercial drivers that hit this bridge, blows my mind.
It's amazing how stupid people are.
"Put these foolish ambitions to rest."
People think the height warning is like the low fuel warning on the dash.  They think the actual clearance is probably higher than indicated.
I've been watching these videos for 14 years and still hasn't gotten old lol
Dude's wife is gonna give him hell.
Glad the accidents haven’t stopped after they slightly heightened the bridge.  Praise to Yovo68 for documenting this 👍
RIP AC units.
Anyone know if the damage to that trailer will be covered by his car insurance?
It's nice to see that they're occurring less often, at least...
Team Bridge is now 175/0.  Undefeated.
KO
Just take a little off the top will ya bridge?  Sure thing, chump!
I wonder what the cars are saying when they honk.
Why of course! Why didn't I think of it sooner?! If you just tease the bridge, maybe it'll make you seem shorter than you actually are!
"If I go slowly, the bridge won't see me" 🤣
They did turn.
Winter Hibernation over time to eat
God I love this bridge!
Oh man I love when they try to sneak up on the bridge.
Maybe the driver was debating backing up and decided they couldn’t? Idk would have been better to read the sign in the first place 😂
I like how they slow down to allow us a nice view of the damage.
That's got to be intentional
A wise man once said stupid is as stupid does. 😉😁
Some snacks for the bridge.
He was committed.
It will clear now.
I have a question. How many vehicles that are too high approximately turn before the bridge?  estimated as a percentage
Respect the bridge and it will respect you back
Like, they knew they were gonna hit, and slowed down, but then proceeded anyway.
Bridge: Over height. Must turn. Driver: No I'm not, I'll prove it! Bridge: Again. Over height. Must turn! Driver: Watch me go slow Bridge: *turns off sign* For the record, I tried. Random truck: Reverse before it gets worse Driver: *fully commits then pulls over afterward* Oh I've made a mistake...So um kids, the Starlink is gone so no wi-fi in the trailer this summer. Driver's kids: So you have chosen death
Love that last piece that falls off at the end, like the bridge spit out a seed.
11'8" MY BELOVED
Maybe if I go reeeaaaaaallllly slow..... 😂😂😂😂    I love a good, high speed peel as much as anyone, but this was pure gold.
were those people honking to warn the driver or telling the driver that stopped to keep going instead of rubber necking?
why are they so stupid
First victim of the year, let's GOOO
he did the ole "sneak up on it" which proves to be a failure 🤦🏻‍♂️😂
Wtf is wrong with these people?
Yay!
Oooo another a/c delete at the 11'8"+8" bridge
This bridge is proof that warning labels are useless because people who are smart don't need the warnings and people who are stupid will ignore them.
There could be 20 people with flags waving and yelling to stop and these morons would still try to pass. Unbelievable.
Driver "please God let it be 11' 7".....dang you Satan"!!!!
"Maybe if I go very slowly, the bridge won't notice me."
People can kid about it but going slower actually raises the trailer, the front of it at least.. Accelerating the truck makes it lower at the back and the trailer drops at the front with that, pivoting on its own axle.
I felt pain when I saw the scene, did he not listen to the other driver who was warning him, did he not see the optical signs warning of the excess of gauge? obviously not to both questions. Here in Spain it is the same, there are bridges that despite warning of excess height there is always someone who decides to arm wrestle to see who gives way first. Greetings from Madrid.
They honked to tell them to STOP, but they would NOT listen!
Bridge:  Over height must turn! Driver:  Fake news, deep state, science denial, fear mongering, government overreach. Bridge:  Crash, tinkle tinkle…
Oh god, I love when they slow down.
Wife:  "I told you not to go under that bridge ! "
why would that other truck stop right next to where they could get hit with whatever is falling off that rv?? 🤦
Tired of being upstaged by the Milwaukee Roundabout, 11'8" bridge decides to take a bite out of the top of a camper to remind everyone that he's still here and he's still hungry.
Anybody knows: a slow vehicle is much lower than a speeding one!
They’re probably moving slowly bc they aren’t sure if they’ll be too tall but MAYYYYYBE they’re just short enough? And when the roof manages to slip by they think “ah see im fine” (if you notice they pick up speed when they don’t immediately hit the thing)  Not realizing that there are in fact attachments above their trailer that are now on the road.   I appre The cars all trying to warn them that they’re destroying their trailer and causing debris hazards on the road tho
Don't do it! Don't do it! Oh well, he did it anyway.
The city needs a toll booth there for people who hit the bridge.
So this driver chose "I'll go super slow maybe it won't notice me" tactic but still left some souvenirs behind😀
If he backs up slowly under the bridge, will that then fix everything?
His insurance company is going to be able to ask him about this one. I guess that he doesn't care about that.
"Why is everyone honking? I'm just being careful as I remove all my expensive equipment from the roof of my camper. They need to learn to mind their own business. Same goes for that stupid sign I ignored." - (someone that thinks they'll get paid insurance money for damages)
This sign wont stop me because I cant read!
remember the good ole days, when the bridge was lower, and trucks would fly through it at top speed.
"Maybe if I go slowly the bridge won't notice me passing underneath."
nah I can make it if I take it slow
If he's camping in the rain or where mosquitoes live, he is screwed.
The legendary canopening continues..
Good.  Been seeing to many of these teetery things hogging up my lane.   Go bridge, go bridge, go bridge!  Numnumnumnum aaahhhhhh!
there goes his satellite receiver and his AC units .. keep pushing forward though, you got big cojones !
Did you know? Driving slowly overrides the laws of physics.
Pffff that's frustrating Why risk it??!!  I don't care how out of the way an alternate  route will take me.
It's only a little. Looks like the bridge wasn't as hungry this time.
Maybe that warning sign should be written in Mexican.
Like a glove, lol
Takes a special kind of stupid
With a purposeful grimace and a terrible cough, it rips the RV's ventilation off.
You’re supposed to turn before going under the bridge….not after!😁
Awesome, just what I needed to brighten my day!
Lmao why did he just keep going
Finally! It has been so long! I missed you, bridge!  And that was even a special laughable case of the sneak and preach approach, with movement after an audible scratch and an encouraging horn concert!
Some Californian, probably.
A gift for my Friday. Thank you
I will like and comment only to help your stats.  I hate to see this, really.
I love the people that think if they drive really slowly that their camper/truck will magically shrink enough to get under the bridge.
Trailer got a shape up.
Wow. Talk about being stubborn.
That Boomer had ONE job.
Once again, driving slower does not make you lower
Geico prices going up because captain wannacamp does not want to read signs.
If he sticks to this strategy during his holiday trip, he can safely pass 6 foot bridges on his way back home.
"Chew your food slowly or you'll choke " said mama bridge
Driver: once i started i have to finish it
Wouldn't it be better if the bridge would be even lower then now ? Now it's nearly possible to drive under there so why don't do it impossible to drive there ?
Not a happy camper
Highlight of the day 🤣 #ReadThoseSigns
That's a good couple of thousand in parts ripped off right there. Plus another couple of thousand to fit the replacements and the 4 month delay in getting a slot at the RV dealership to do the work, plus a roof that will now leak.   You just can't get the message through to some when it says "OVERHEIGHT... MUST TURN" in big flashing letters that it means them.
I love how honking can fix stupid.
If they bulit a brick wall across the entire thing somebody would still try to sneak their way though.
The only thing that they could add is a warning sound. That might help some people pay a bit more attention...
Thousands of dollars. More money than good sense.
People honking this person was the cherry on top...but they were so far in their was no turning back.
They never learned
🤔 You would think when you started learning the crunching sounds you'd stop and back up to avoid further damage.    But not his guy! He must keps creepin right on through 😂
お久しぶりでございます〜
Finally a new video. I've been waiting for years man!!
You'd think the person who sold them the caravan that they would warn them about it's height and low bridges !! As a trucker you must always know the height of your rig.
Hopefully he came back for the stuff the left
Maybe if I go reeeally slow, it'll make my vehicle shorter.
Finally, after waiting half a year posting bridge videos
Here's crunching of rooftop equipment being destroyed.    Crawls slowly hoping that will lessen the damage!
Driver: Oh my trailer is just short of that itll be fine they just make the sensor read lower to be safe.... FORGETS ABOUT ALL THE SHIT STICK UP FROM THE TOP thats not accounted for in the trailer specs
incredible how people interpret 'overheight must turn' as 'ill just go slow and itll be fine'
If I saw a sign saying “overheight” I would not understand what it meant. I never heard that word before I saw this beloved channel.
Warning signs blink like crazy: "Overheigh! Must turn!"  Driver with the only tall vehicle in the area: "Huhh, I wonder who is this for..."
Yasss!
In my head, the progression of that driver's thinking: - "My trailer will fit under that bridge, no problem" - "That flashing sign doesn't apply to me" - "If I go real slow, my trailer will fit" - "That crunching sound isn't my trailer" - "That honking isn't directed towards me" - "Just gonna pull over here and make sure my trailer is OK" - "Well, Fcuk"
Love this!!!  Warning lights and signs all over the place, but nobody heeds the them.
It's been a while. I was worried something might have happened to it.
didn't Einstein say the slower you travel the less volume you occupied in the space time continuum if only he went that little bit slower maybe, just maybe
A little off the top! :D
Not much of a snack for the bridge. Must be starving after all this time. Especially since air conditioner units are not terribly filling 😂
The first victim of the year!
Ah an midday snack, yum
Everyone thinks nah I'll make it through,I'd love to own the repairs shop around the corner its gotta be a goldmine
"If I rip the air-conditioner off SLOWLY, no-one will notice"
That just doesn't make any sense. The laws of physics states that no matter the height if you go extra slow you will make it underneath. It's a real head scratcher.
Tasty Snack
I didn't know that if you drive slowly the height of the car will decrease... Ahhh definitely not
There are 18 Vehicle Repair Shops around this bridge already according to Google Maps kkkkkkkkk
I love genius's!
Driver: I can make this Bridge: and I took it personally
So glad I have the bell turned on for these
It's been a hot minute since the bridge was fed
Just a shave
He got lucky he went really slow not too bad I rather have that instead of having my roof ripped right off like those other RV/truck/bus drivers
Tries to sneak up on it but the bridge never sleeps
Seeing those paint scratches under the bar makes me laugh every time.
Ah, the ol "lemme see if driving slowly will avoid getting hit"
Thank you, yovo68, for all these years of entertainment
Stop! Who would cross the Bridge of Death must answer me these questions three, ere the other side he see. 1. What is your name? 2. What is your quest? 3. Are you less than 12 foot 4 inches?
It's been a while, good to see the bridge is still in charge.
Commercial: "Go on a real vacation. Go RVing" Day 1 of RVing:
The only way to stop these bellends from driving under the bridge is to make it so 6 feet titanium bars with spikes rise up from the ground when the system detect a too tall vehicle. Hell, make these bars spin too really fast on top of it all.
It's alive! Greetings from Soviet Russia.
I wonder when people will realize that going slower doesn´t decrease your vehicles hight....
This feels like it’s the same as the stay off the black rocks in my province where nobody lessons and continue to do it
Weight reduction
Bruh 🤣
He should have gone slower. 😋
He almost made it! Shame too because it’s a lovely camper.
Wouldn’t you love to hear the conversations going on inside the vehicles before, during and after !!
I wish they lowered the bar instead to make the damage worse
Definitely make my day here;)
there's my fix of 11-8+8 for the day.
I like how the pickup truck stops just in case anyone wanted to be safe and get by
That camper is ruined. They'll never track down all the roof leaks.
It's been a while. Good to see another caravan taking off the air conditioners
I love when they slowly crawl up to the bridge, as if that somehow makes them smaller
It still lives on!!
They know It's risky. They still go under the bridge; even though, there is a better way.
does the glowing sign only start blinking when a tall vehicle is detected?
They deserved that.  What an idiot. Glad that happened to this person so they don't make a bigger mistake some day that effects other people. They had plenty of warnings and ignored all of them.
Look; if you're that unsure of making it through, just go round, its not worth the risk.
Wow, just wow! Pieces are still falling off the camper as they drive away. You'd think they would stop after the first hit but no.
The bridge is very hungry lately.
Lucky for him (or her) he didn't go full-blown can opener.
😆😆 Just go slow
Finally is time new for a collision👌
Maybe if I go really, REALLY SLOW, my over height trailer will get shorter...Or maybe the bridge will get higher???
Proff, if proof were needed, that some people don't have the brains they were born with.
Hey! At least the driver turned.
Yayy, get to point and laugh at idiots \o/
I just visited this bridge a few weeks ago!
....And he just keeps driving lmao By the time you hear the crunching sound and other drivers honk at you, you should fucking reverse
Driver could’ve saved some equipment by stopping when the honking started
I know it's a fun joke to make, but I'm pretty sure drivers don't _actually_ think that driving slower makes them less likely to hit. Rather, I think they're trying to minimize damage if they do hit.
Great way to start a Friday. Maybe not for that guy but hey, now he's famous
a mere snack for the can opener. It will suffice, for now.
This simply never gets old. It's truly the gift that keeps on giving.
Kid "Dad, the sign says OVER HEIGHT MUST TURN" Trump Dad "That's fake news, son. A bunch of libtards made that sign. They are just trying to control our movements.. don't believe everything you read" *SMASH CRACK BOOM* Kid "uh... Dad??"
Toll paid.
He probably saved a huge amount of time by going underneath the bridge. Now all he has to do is spend a little bit of time and money to repair his trailer. Sounds like a win win situation to me!
The bridge has awakened from its long winter's slumber and has begun to feed!
Feed The Beast, for its hunger is insatiable!
Ive been waiting for this
And I thought it was raised high enough for RVs and trailers.
Maybe if I go nice and slow my camper will shrink a little
Amo las notificaciones de este canal 😉
It’s been awhile since it has had its last snack
stealth check failed
Gotta love how people seem to think slowing down will magically make the bridge raise itself.....
Idk what's worse, people who don't see or notice the billion signs, lights and flashing OVERHEIGHT, or those that do, slow down, but still continue (this time even with multiple horns tooting lol)
"If I drive slower, the bridge won't see me as a threat"
Love how they slowed down in order to...shrink?
Now he has to spend money fixing the damage he just did to his trailer. Another example of you can’t fix stupid.😳🤦‍♂️  However some wonderful entertainment for the rest of us who enjoy this channel. 😀🤣
Bridge knows best. Even though he was just barely too tall, the sensors knew.
Geometry is hard
Wow are people stupid!
Doesn't matter how many warning signs this town puts up. There is always gonna be someone who thinks they don't apply to them. Someone could open a business on the other side of the bridge that fixes all the damage done by this bridge & probably make a good living off of it
The bridge really savored that meal.  Took it nice and slow.
these videos are like the bridge, pops up when you least expect it
Yay, it’s back!
Its baffles me how people ignore that BIG FLASHING SIGN that warns them this will happen 😆
No matter how sneaky or clever you think you are, the bridge always takes their due.
213 likes in 3 mins. Impressive.
Replacing those air conditioners is only like $5 right?  right?!?
I love that this is still going, despite the bridge being raised
What's the point of going slow if you're just going to keep going if you're too tall?
Bruh
Another great video! If the person named "Damaged" comments again you should block them. He called my friend a "sockpuppet".
I’m betting people who live there get sick of watching people do this.  But I sure don’t.  😏
Let the tyres down next time, few PSI helps a few inches.
He gambled he lost
Three things are certain in life: death, taxes, and idiots
First crash in 2022
Louder for those in the back: Going 👏 slower 👏 does 👏 not 👏 make 👏 you 👏 shorter 👏
Ahh yes, the bridge fed again!
Good samaritan feeds the bridge who hasn't eaten in 4 months
Surgical mole removal
I guess the only thing constant in life are change and the certainty that someone with an overheight vehicle will drive below that bridge 😂
"If I go slow I can get under it"
Sorry for your loss.
You can fix a bridge but you can't fix stupid.
Nibble Nibble
If I inch up slowly, nothing bad will happen… right? RIGHT? (Bridge gets a little snack nomnom 😋)
i love how the locals all honk at them. they just know how its gonna end
Eh, I guess they didn't need those vents and/or AC units anyway.
"If l go reeaallyy slowly, it won't hurt."
Physics no longer apply at low speed, not a lot of people know that
"If I drive slowly the bridge gets higher right?"
He could’ve made it if the other driver wouldn’t have honked. 🤣🤣🤣
if you drive slower the bar gets higher evidently
Literally was just here yesterday. Damn
It has been a while...
It's been way too long since your last meal.
a smol snack 😋
I appreciate how the pickup tried to warn them.
Just cleaning the roof for him
Lol... never have I dropped what I was doing so fast to click a video...
Dude honked at him and he still kept going
We are back baby
ouch.. the damages
*Nhac*
YAY!!
The kind of notification I immediately understand when I see.
yay new video
finally, the bridge was hungry!
Look like the bridge is hungry again..
Ooooooh another snack~
classic sneak up on the crash-bar for a snack.
Ah, so close.
