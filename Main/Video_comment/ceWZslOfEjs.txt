"It's Valentine's Day, Tom! People are doing all sorts of romantic content, what are y— never mind."
Its probably for the best they didnt nuke a massive gas cavern right there given the massive moor fire currently blazing about 3/4 miles away. Gas storage cavern and underground peat fire not mix well.
Excellent; fascinating. The usual dislike because TMTSOYT, but I enjoyed that.
There is amarican to create canal like suez in israel in the 1990
hmm, you never found that note that they didn't pursue the idea. Maybe they did. Maybe there is a giant radioactive hole somewhere.
Well, if it had to be *anywhere…*
Where was the rock supposed to go from this explosion? it would not just disappear, unless it lifts all the rock above it including the surface how can it leave a big void?
Teeside would be the obvious target !?
Why do we have muppets running this country or even thinking of this🤭🙄
Exactly what Israel tends to do to create the new alternative Suez Canal going from the gulf of Aqaba to guess where? Gaza... hmm, of course that is completely coincidental to the current situation.
Eeee Edna, I felt tut earth move flower.
Leeds and Bradford look like Hiroshima and Nagasaki 10 minutes after their nukes.
Do some research please....they did one in the centre of Bradford in 1985
who else lives near whitby and thinks its mad hearing tom scott talk about it
Well, there’s nothing of value in Yorkshire so, it makes complete sense.
And........... it never got near the PM's desk, yes it was just a report after all
Have you seen how Yorkshire women cook, or Yorkshire men play football, maybe it was not such a bad idea.
As a Lancastrian, understandable.
There was a plan to build a new Panama canal using nukes!
At least they had out of the box thinking in those days, not like today.
Good grief. In gods chosen county as well. Shocking
They did....an airburst above hull....made no difference.....
Is this still available? Thanks
Plot twist: the chap whom proposed the plan was from Lancashire 😂
1:03 “Nukanal”, incidentally, would be a great name for the new carved-out-by-nukes canal.
The crazy thing is that it actually was nuked and no one ever did notice. The docs are all still classified.
Chances are, the reason they aborted the project was due to concerns raised by one specific individual maybe about his own personal property.  Maybe the public would find it horrific that this specific individual wielded such authority (could have been Jimmy Saville).  So to save controversy, they're not going to let it slip now.
It might have been a good idea?
"Yorkshire? What is, Yorkshire?"
The harrowing of the North 2.0... why can't they plan this nonsense for the home counties?
It's kinda funny the two villages proposed for evacuation are named Pickering and Whitby. In Canada, Pickering is home to one of Ontario's three nuclear generating stations, and Whitby--15 kilometers east--is halfway to the Darlington plant.
Yorkshire! Yorkshire! Yorkshire???
Did they take a page out of the USA's book on this one? Geez.
😂 i remember reading this in history class...i wish tom would consider being a Internet school teacher.😂
Anyone else feel like that big stump in the ditch was actually a hatch on top of the aforementioned nuke hole and the bomb was just chilling under it ever since?
"It is not somewhere I'd expect someone to try and set off a nuclear explosion"  Tom has clearly never had a night out in Leeds or Sheffield!
This is complete nonsense and Tom scott has no understanding about what he has read.
very interesting and cool. So if we find an explosive comparable to nuclear bombs without radiation or other noxious substances, we would be able to create giant underground gas tanks. Can we call them fart holes?
Do salt domes ! ! ! ! Do salt domes ! ! ! !
There were plans to test atom bombs in Scotland, but William Penney, Chief Govt Scientist, suggested it wasn't a good idea, so the atmospheric tests were carried out in Australia.
who was in control of parliament and how were the voters in yorkshire leaning at the time?
Not in the South of England of course.
Plot twist…. They actually went through with it and it went off without a hitch. What you read was the double bluff file 😉
Radiation stuff is used in the oil and gas industries in Canada. The symbols are on the company trucks. Probably they are not using 20 kilotonne devices. Or are they? Apparently the North Koreans do.
Did I read that they did explode a bomb in the south, Aldermaston? Then shovelled all the contamination into open topped lorries and drove them up to Scotland to dump in the sea off Stranraer?
Leeds?
"Peaceful nuclear explosion". An oxymoron if ever I heard one.
They (Brits, French, Americans) tested their nukes all over the Pacific. Thanks alot.
Ee by heck it’s t’nuclear bomb
Amusing everything goes according to  plan they had ended up with perfect chamber  with all the rock walls melted smooth.  Doesn't  good old common sense tell you the when nuclear bomb expodes it will find the weakst point. Which would be where the drill hole was, therefore the chamber would be literally end up pear shaped! The force of the bomb going upward , would most likely cause factures in the rocks  eventually leading to the ingress of water into the chamber. Nature would  find a way to add the chamber into part of the pothole system North Yorshire is famous for!
Rumour has it they detonated a nuclear device in South Shields. It 50 quids worth of damage …. And most of that was to the bomb.
This is why we Yorkshire lot collectively hate the South, London and Westminster. We know what contempt they have for us. My vote is for London 👍
The Soviets had another plan
A 25 Kiloton bomb is not that big for a nuclear device. The one on Hiroshima was 12 Kt I believe.  Most of the damage was done by the firestorm that raged after the initial blast and the fact that most of the city was wooden structures with paper covering the windows. Proof in point, one of the few reinforced concrete structures in Hiroshima happened to be almost in the middle of ground zero and it largely survived. The structure. Not the people inside it.
They aint setting no nukes of in gods country 100%
We should listen to all the arguments before we decide.
it does make a lot of sense when you have used dynamite and other explosives to make caverns, they just didn’t quite realise radiation existed
FFS! The verb is ‘to detonate’…!!!  Please Tom, don’t denigrate your English to the American level, it’s unbecoming…
what do you mean it never happened? have you seen the state of Northallerton?
i read that as "my top secret plan"
There's still applications where we'd benefit from peaceful nuclear explosions. Project Orion would allow interstellar travel on a timescale similar to a human lifespan; no one has figured out a more accessible way of doing that.
why couldnt you do this using a really big regular bomb
There is no such thing as a completely contained nuclear explosion, the ground fractures and the fission products vent no matter what the nuclear death cults tell you.  That is why the ground is littered with craters where underground testing is done.  And if a hole caves in, that means the soil shifted all the way to its epicenter, and filled the cavity.  But I'm sure the pro nuclear apologist bots will reply otherwise... bring it on.
as someone who wants to drive across the UK going to national parks to stargaze with my scope, i'm glad they didn't ruin the moors.
Google -  Fulbeck celebrate 30years nuclear waste campaign
Do a, not sure how to say it, timber farmering  kind of sticks out here. Research the plyboard patent owner, without saying names, its kind of funny.
i should bloody hooope not!
plot twist, tom is actually standing on two of a top secret gas storage facility
“Put hole int ground lads”
I suppose they took into consideration the radiation in the water table, 😂😂😂😂😂😂
You might find Greensides mine near glenridding worth a look.   It too had some cool nuclear history in a national park.
It's been done
Multiple myeloma in Yorkshire?
where would all the rock and dirt and stuff go where the cavern would be?
Would this great cavern created  have just collapsed into itself ????
Let's be completely honest.   Someone just wanted to watch Yorkshire blow up.
Wow, I never gave this a like... I have now. I just watched History Matters's video on Britain's nuclear program, and it reminded me of this.
We should nuke a fault line....
Didn't the Soviet Union use a nuclear bomb to collapse a oil pipeline or natural gas that caught fire and was burning for years they couldn't find out how to put out the fire in any way but figured out a nuclear bomb to collapse the shaft cutting oxygen and simply putting it out crazy story check it out on YouTube probably could find it easily
Why couldn't they have just used conventional explosives to create a huge hole in the ground? - Just like they do in ordinary mining?
I am offended by the thumbnail! Personally I thought I had a great plan!
You can do this without nuking the ground at all in Alberta Canada they drill into big caverns underground to store natural gas
I've always said the Berkshire town of Hungerford would be a perfect location for peaceful nuking. Not for any construction reasons, it's just a shithole that could do with a good nuking.
the phrase "NUCLEAR FRACKING" is going to haunt me for a while now.
If that happened I most likely wouldn't be here
Was there any guarantee that Gas stored down there would stay there?
What is the big deal, Yorkshire is completely impervious to even nuclear explosions, anywhere that can produce 180 plus episodes of HEARTBEAT could easily shrug off a PUNY ATOMIC BOMB.
Great work Thank you
Why would the fact that Wheeldale was never nuked remain a classified secret fifty years later?  Surely it would only remain classified if something did happen there.  Did anybody ask the locals if they remembered any odd earthquakes in the 1970s?
Are you sure they never did it? Drilled down deeper and used a smaller nuke so no one would notice, and that you're not standing atop a huge radioactive spherical cave? Just a thought.
Lancs county council have put it back on the table
This is literally what the US did in the Desert of Nevada. Trying to figure out if you could use nukes to make cannels or mountain passages for roads.
After the explosion where does the soil go that creates the cavern?
*looks at title* Classic tom.
Instead, they should've proposed to do it above land, so we can hurry up and wipe out the forests that we hate so much.
If nuclear explosions didn’t produce radiation I wonder if they would be used for peaceful purposes more often 🤔
A nuclear bomb? In Yorkshire? If they could set it off around say, Bradford, that'd be perfect.
What a total bunch of wallies not consider the contamination! !!
Owowow ravens gate is open
Look into the “Wagon Wheel Program” I believe 100 nukes planned to go off
Blowing Bradford up in West Yorkshire would of been a good place to test a nuke.. HTFC
Strangely, in the alternate universe where this went ahead, it somehow solved ALL of Britain's problems.
The current and outgoing PM would probably agree to this, in 2022.
Or were they?
"screw it lets just use australia"
can't see a problem tbh, it's only Yorkshire
Galaxy Brain levels of landscaping xD
Nuke Lancashire not gods owns.
Should of done it
why does everything happen in yorkshire
Instead they did it in Australia 😕
I love nuclear explosions.  There should be more of them.
So can I nuke my garden to build a swimming pool?
what about nuclear fusion bombs that don't leave behind radiation? Or a series of smaller bombs? I can imagine capturing co2 and trapping it underground could help combat climate change.
Britain detonated 6 nuclear bombs  in Australia, 5 at Maralinga and 1  off the coast of Western Australia.
РУССКИЕ СУБТИТРЫ ПОСТАВЬ.  ВПЕРВУЮ ОЧЕРЕДЬ
Nuking Yorkshire? An idea probably dreamed up by a Lancastrian.. :P
nuclear weapons as long as weapons exist proves that were still stone age and very primitive beasts  technology changes humans never change
Great….
A happy ending…. Unlike most of my valentines days.
the point is that they  genocided got rich and the threatened everybody with the idea that they had the bomb to prevent retaliation  in ww1 they  released the influenza and killed 22 million people
hydrogen bomb. a tanker full of nitro glycerin each ship has a component its mixed then boom!  real easy to make look it up!  how big would a whole ship full do!
not very secret
no my tea
Ee
I understand the impulse to use huge explosions for big engineering projects, but it honestly shocks me how much governments still underestimated the effects of radiation nearly 15 years after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It's a bomb that poisons everything it touches for decades! Centuries, even! Why did it take so many people so many years and billions of dollars to realize that you can't just nuke something "a little bit"?!
Plot twist the goverment just doesnt like yorkshire
2:40 you forgot the part where we send a guy down the hole to arm the Nuke.. Ok maybe it wasn't the 60's anymore and they figured out a wire to operate a drop hatch to allow the two elements to be armed.If you haven't seen the video where the poor soul had to go into a drill hole to arm the nuke.. you should look it up.
What harm would it have done! It's only Yorkshire!!.😂.
I feel like 'Nuking Yorkshire' could also have been some sort of fever dream Thatcher woke up from in the mid 80s.
Sheffield would have been a good place
a nuke would probably improve it.
I think you just told us wheee the fallout timeline begun
Certainly admirable to try to find a use for nuclear bombs that wasn’t “killing a great many people at once”, at least!
Scary, the french used our country  New Zealand as a base to explode nuclear bombs in the Pacific, poxy bastards.
There is a Thunderbirds episode using nuks for construction. Which shows the thinking of the time
On footage I’ve seen of underground nuclear blasts it seems like the resulting cavity usually collapses after a very well determined period of time (after the fireball has cooled sufficiently). If that’s the case then it doesn’t sound ideal for gas storage?
Thank you for risking your life for that teaser shot with the snowboard.
That we know of …
Strange Recipe for Yorkshire Pudding
Laughing at the idea of a country as small as the UK trying to test bombs on their island like... I'm sorry but it's not a good idea....
Has anyone gotten a data time ad before watching a Tom Scott video?
Of course one day they'll figure out how to have the radioactivity get used up in some clever way that makes nukes clean and then it'll be a nuclear willy nilly situation.....
" operation Orpheus " is an interesting little item to take a look at
In 18 months time Tom finds a new just declassified report in the archives... they did it, but 2 miles down the road 😳
How does it leave a cavern. Is it because the material would be vaporized? If so, that vapor would need to go somewhere and it would be radioactive. If it didn't vaporize, what happened to it? You can change a form with which a material is in but can you change its density, its volume, so much that it would have formed a massive cavern?
Well, Britain thought about it. US planned it, Soviet tried it.    If people say "the government wouldn't do that". Remember that other stuff stays classified
Perkins: Sir! Sir! I've had a wizard idea on how to create a huge natural gas storage facility for not much money. Bigwig from the Ministry: Well come on then lad, let's hear it Perkins: Well Sir, what you do, is you drill a deep hole in north yorkshire, and put a 25 KT nuclear device in it, and then seal it up and... Bigwig: Perkins, I really don't want to hear another word, you know perfectly well... Perkins: But sir, we've done a feasibility study and found a site and everything sir, just need 9 million pounds a teensy weensy bit of help with planning permission Bigwig: Perkins, I'm not making myself clear enough. Leave this office now, and never darken my door again. If you ever do feel the need to come back, you will find a Webley with one round in it in the desk outside, do the decent thing and save us all some trouble.
Poor hobbits
I wonder if the idea was put through by some devonshires
Up north, naturally. Back then there was no levelling up, just plans to level US.
Can they do this now buy just in Birmingham?
When MCU make "what if?" Episode of this video
Thanks to Oppenheimer inventing these bombs we could be on the verge of an apocalypse at any moment. I do not agree with nuking anyone and that includes Axis Japan. It is an absolute psychopathic thing to unleash and a crime against humanity either way. I do not know why Oppenheimer is lauded to be honest.
the Soviets were always a bit more extreme intrying stuff , ecept "Operation Fish bowl"
Is there a two word phrase worse for the environment than "Nuclear Fracking"?
nice vide
I am also a never-nuked. There are dozens of us!
top sneaky
2:06  the price tag for a 25KT bomb at £ 164,000    what would that be (inflation adjusted) today ?
Makes more sense when you know the idea came from Lancashire.
"Scientist" have been incredibly stupid with A bombs.
This is why New York was built
bobm.
The Soviet Union did this several times and it worked. It's actually a good idea. Radiation was not that big of a problem.
Even more scary was the plan in 1953 to detonate a nuclear bomb in Skipsea church tower!  What is it with Yorkshire and London based politicians?
I was concerned by the title as I live in Yorkshire
Why didn’t they use bridgewater?
Gotta hide those UAPs somewhere.
Another piece of history, tks TS :)
Less than a quater million for a nuclear bomb, thats a good sale!
All of the secrets are hidden underground - You main focus should be underground.
Wheeldale, a lovely area near Goathland . Glad they didn’t destroy it.
Yes they had already been to MARALINGA, South Australia between 1956 and 1963, They detonated seven nuclear tests, They displaced the local indigenous people who will never be able to live there again in there life time. Yes they were above ground tests. No wonder they did not want to let one off in the U.K
Do a search for "Tatum Salt Dome" or "Salmon Site".
Using nukes to build a canal is one of the most American things I have ever heard of.
The curious mass selectively handle because rain additonally encourage an a meaty motion. assorted, hospitable february
Can you imagine the protests if they'd tried this!
where have all the trees gone ??
If they planned to do it in Milton Keynes they probably would have been given the green light. What's the worst that could happen?
they should have done it Norfolk...  it's not like there's anything there anyway.
Well it’s not so secret anymore.
Makes a change from their plans for Scotland ... although in their "minds" both are just "Northern Britain" and so therefore, worthless..
why not do it with conventional explosives? surely not that much more expensive
0:08 is that signed  Hollingworth??
it all makes sense now, yorkshire puddings look like a massive crater! :o
You Grits did nuke Maralinga in Australia though. I suppose that was far enough away from Yorkshire for you. It did kill a few aborigines though that got caught up in the Fallout. I'm not even sure you have said sorry.
Project PACER was the craziest version of these nuclear ideas
Wow,, there were similar investigations to do this in the North West of Australia around the same time
Post Second World War, the inhabitants of Bikini Atoll were forcibly relocated in 1946, the site of 23 nuclear tests by the United States until 1958…
Conspiracy theory time; could there be thousands of underground caverns beneath North Korea and the other nuclear countries? Could these be turned into Fallout style bunkers where laws don't exist and people are held prisoner? Epstein had connections...
Could you change "fracking" to "frac'ing" (short for "fracturing") in the subtitles?  It's the correct spelling.
Shame… We could do with some new and interesting flora and fauna in Britain. Also, they’ve tried using a plug before… Apparently it’s still travelling through space
How can you create a 600m cavity without extracting the material? Nuke bombs melt, do not annihilate
That's as stupid as the suggestion that Trump made, to set off a nuclear bomb in the center of a tornado.
And people still think they live in the worst timeline.
The UK is big enough to have national parks how great
so what about a Wasserstoffbomb?
This would be a fantastic idea if anti-matter could be used so that fission product materials were minimized.  Clean burn fission/fusion bombs would be ideal for heavy lift impulse rockets or guns.
I wonder what the cost of the survey was.
They would have to have evacuated all the Ferrets otherwise there'd have been trouble at t'mill.
"Nuclear fracking" is just such a staggeringly bad combination of words for a modern viewer, it's wild to think that used to be something people considered doing.
After all, if you're going to test a nuclear bomb in Britain, you should at least choose a place no British people care about.  Like Old Trafford.
I can imagine this as an episode of YES, Prime Minister. The amount of cynicism and dark humor would be off the charts.
I live in this area and it’s crazy to think that a nuclear bomb would’ve been detonated here
It's never a good plan anywhere.
This is a typically plucky Brit solution quashed by typically British pragmatism.
I've had a few "Eureka!" moments in my own research at Kew, but never one quite as big as this! In comparison, mooring surplus landing craft topped with scaffolding and corrugate iron over the Tube tunnels under the Thames to provide a "bursting layer" against V2s seems almost sensible.
Interesting. But I have two questions that I have no chance of answering myself: What size of cavity were they looking to create deep under the North Yorkshire Moors? And where would the rock go that was actually contained there?
always trust the science.
It makes you wonder what other nuking events that did happen but were never declassified so no one knows about them.
They actually carried this out in South Yorkshire and used Rotherham as the site. Unfortunately, no one could tell the difference so they scrapped the idea of expanding it...
Lancashire I would understand but Yorkshire?
Good video but, hear me out ok 😳
Okay...hear me out...wouldn't this be a perfect way to create a nuclear waste storage site? Akin to Onkalo; drill out a tunnel under the sea, pop in a nuke, blast out a cavern, then use it to store nuclear waste. When it's full, just seal the passage up with concrete and forget about it.
Is nuclear space propulsion also against international law? (Like beyond lunar orbit, not in LEO)
what could possibly go wrong???
You kinda glossed over it, but I'm really curious - how does a nuclear explosion underground create a cave? I mean, it's not like it destroys the mass of the soil around it. The only real explanation I can think of is it pushes the ground up, creating a small hill on the surface. But then again, why should that cave stay like that and not collapse? Is it the heat that makes it structurally sound? Does it melt the edges in exactly such a way that they solidify before the pressure normalizes? And talking about a pressure ... are you telling me that a nuclear explosion would create a round cave, but the pressure would not make the material break above the surface? We are talking about a solid mass evaporating ... and you are telling me the pressure would stay contained? So many questions ...
Plot twist... they went ahead with it anyway.  Would you know if it was there? Just imagine 🤪
You'd think you'd wipe out west yorkshire out of all of the county.
Jordvik!
didn't France... do something like this?
Awesome
i never thought you could make fracking any worse, but heres nuclear fracking
Love learning about history that never happened
So they sum up the cost of the entire project? So does it say how much a nuke costs?
This 100% happened in the fallout universe and that is absolutely why they haven't set a game in Europe yet
In a different timeline, james acaster would have made a joke about the time somebody exploded a nike near his hometown. How this would work alongside the Pickering FC song is a mystery.
Ah yes, COMPLETELY reasonable...
What's the worst that could happen, make some Yorkshire towns uninhabitable? A few decades later, it happened anyway...
Sometimes you have do a white paper to demonstrate how bad an idea really is.
its obviously a bad idea but just how difficult is radiation to "clean up" exactly? .... asking for a curious friend
What an amazing idea! What's the worst that could happen?
The yorkshire moors are burned annually to keep the stupid monoculture of game birds going strong!! Calling it a national park is so misleading!! Its essentially a play ground for toffs so they get off on shooting birds!!
The main problem with this plan was the location. As anyone in the UK will be able to tell you, if a nuke had to be detonated in Yorkshire, it shouldn't be done in a nice national park.  It should be detonated right in the middle of Bradford. (after evacuating the three normal people who live there)
Close to the proposed site, the Duchy of Lancaster (i.e. the Queen) owns a large estate at Goathland which they manage for grouse shooting.  Perhaps the plan was shelved as it would mean a disruption to their sport?
Bradford in Yorkshire looks like a nuclear apocalypse wasteland, including mutant locals.
This explains Leeds.
I'm already on board
How old is this guy?
so there are ruins from the Tartarian empire underneat York that govt wanted to destroy.  interesting.
1969
Only a few miles from Fylingdales!!
As a guy born close to Semey polygon I can tell. That was ABSOLUTLEY right decidion.
Oh Tom, that's a clickbait thumbnail. For shame.
I love that governments have detonated 1000's of nukes and totally destroyed atmosphere, land and lives.
I'm sure a nuke would be powerful enough to clean the remains of a beached whale...
In the cost estimate, what was the cost of the bomb estimated to be?
It's hard to imagine there was that much ignorance about the contamination caused by a nuclear explosion back in '69, but there obviously was!
"The radiation ended up contaminating the gas" .... you don't say, who would have thunk it?
I definitely admire the people who took the whole “nuclear bomb” thing and tried to do something different with it. I mean, nuclear fission/fusion was (and still is tbh) the stuff of science fiction and I’m sure once they started to crack that they felt like it must have a nearly infinite number of uses. Back then, it must’ve felt as close to magic as you could get. I know it was very quickly sorted out that it wasn’t what they thought it was, but in those developmental moments it probably felt like a crazy new world to explore in all fields.
They already knew about the two nuclear bombs that were dropped in Japan and killed a hundred thousand people, so why didn't they think that it would be a bad idea?
Yorkshire?   That's  here on my house !!! not cool.
Wouldn't it have been cheaper and safer to use an existing underground cave?
I live in Scarborough so I find this very interesting.
“Nuclear Fraking” is not a pair of words that should ever be together.
I live in west Yorkshire 😳
Never fails to amaze me where Tom actually finds these stories. The ideas for these vids must be job in itself. Love this channel
I'm puzzled. How can a nuke create a cavern in solid rock? Any material that is melted or vapourised will condese back to solid- it can't just vanish.
The thought that comes to mind though is using nukes to create reservoirs for CO2 + H2S storage. Currently we just use old gas wells but at a certain point we will presumably run out of reservoir capacity.
I don’t know if you’ll see this, but I’d love to see a video on Number Stations. (Ex. LincolnShire Poacher, Swedish Rhapsody, Ect.)
Carl Sagan, as an undergrad, was on the review team for a similar idea about 10 years earlier, just replace "Yorkshire" with "the moon." That was also not a good plan (and I expect Dr. Sagan said so).
For a handful of fcats, that's a damned good yarn, Tom.
nuclear fracking. Huh.
Imagine looking for files about how many rivers in England are over 1000000ft long (or whatever tom was looking for) and you stumbled across plans to set off a nuclear bomb
Should of done the middle of London
Interesting that you mention the possible effects on Pickering.  The Canadian namesake of Pickering, Ontario is home to an 8 reactor nuclear power station and when you stopped at the local railway station there are (or at least used to be) signs that read "We radiate happiness " 😄😄
By June 1969 there had been a total of 954 nuclear bombs detonated, all but 2 for "peaceful" purposes.
London, would have been a better choice.
Essex I could understand..............but Yorkshire?
Wish Kurzgesagt would make a video about it. :D
England has way too little land space to mess around with that. I know America does crazy stuff but we have massive desert areas nearly the size of England. Places you can drive all day and not see a house.
☢️🔁🌞
To be fair, would any one really notice if Yorkshire was nuked?
Several places could be improved by a safe, contained Nuclear Explosion. Mars, for instance
Acutally the Soviets kept doing "peaceful nuclear explosions" into the Gorbachev era. Apparently it *is* a good way to fix a blown out oil or gas well when *nothing else* will help.
If the explosion makes a 'cavern' then I assume the rock is vaporized? If the top is sealed - where does the gaseous material go?
no thank you 😭
Lookup Cornwall nuclear test site. Near Callington. Excelsior tunnel, United Mine, Kitt Hill.
"Wow, it's Valentine's day! Time to talk about some dumb plans about exploding a bomb in residential area!"
you look young and old at the same time wtf
Remember Nyrex?  They wanted to hide a load of radioactive material under Billingham.  Billingham was chosen because there are natural caves there and, if things went bad, the population had the lowest average IQ in the UK and would not be missed.  Needless to say, this did not go down too well in Billingham.
Most people I live near don’t realize that we are just a few miles away from one of those natural gas underground storage sites. The only way to know is by looking at the little warning signs posted on right of ways and fences.
Not Sheffield then. I'm surprised...
a tv show similar to utopia where they discuss this would be funny as
A fascinating video.  I have a vague memory, from O level Geography in the 70s, that there were issues with the liquid natural gas storage tanks on Canvey Island.  These tanks are essentially holes in the ground covered with a cap to keep the gas in, under pressure, as it's liquid, and cold.  The problem is that the surrounding ground has become frozen too, with permafrost, that was gradually expanding.  Being Canvey these are all below sea level too, but that's another issue.  I wonder if gas storage was being addressed in Government at the time, and underground caverns in Yorkshire made some sense?
I mean an explosion wouldnt actually remove the rock thats there though? At most it would crack it up slightly, right? At least it wouldnt make a large empty space, right?
Always a pleasure to get schooled by Tom 🤗

Just casually researching previously secret, unclassified documents at the national archive, as you do.
It's not the North Yorkshire Moors, it's called the North York Moors. Great video though, as ever!
The grand possibility of having a radioactive Tom Scott has eluded us yet again
Interesting topic but your 360 with the selfie stick almost made me sick.
I strongly suspect you're using this video to optimize your SEO :-P
4:25 "meanwhile further thought would be given to what action should follow" feels like they're canning it without specifically canning it
e
Tom you come up with some amazing stuff!
Best site to nuke in North Yorkshire would have been Selby.
sad that we couldn't get rid of Yorkshire while we had the chance...
It's the North York Moors, not North Yorkshire Moors, though it does have the North Yorkshire Moors Railway running through it.
"Who would want to nuke Yorkshire!?"  "Oh, the Gas Board.  Figures."
They should’ve made a gate to the Backrooms, then boom kilometres and kilometres of space
What a hilarious concept. Where were they assuming all the soil and rock would end up? You can’t just “create” a hole. The stuff that was there still has to go somewhere.
Interpol here.  You can’t say bomb on YouTube.  Or in an airplane.
What could go wrong?
Glad you had your jaw back!
can you please talk about the atrocities of nuclear explosions down in australia done by the english
I'm sure they got the results of the tests from the Americans in the New Mexico and Nevada deserts.
G'day,  Look up   "Northwest Cape"  &  "Maralinga"  Last time I tasted Fallout on my Cornflakes was 1963, when QE-II directed her Royal Air Farce to nuke Oz, initially using functional Fission Bombs and  culminating in a Plutonium Fizzle-Yield Test, investigating Warhead Fratricide ; when the pusilanimous Pommie Pissants deliberately crippled the timing of the detonation of the Compression Charges - and blew the Plutonium Walnut to powder and scattered it to the Winds over Central Australia, upwind of my Breakfast.  Of course, Shitehall assured Canberra it was all perfucktly safe.  And, sadly, nobody in The Lodge had sufficient courage to reply that if it was so "safe" then the top of Big Ben in London would have Bin-Ideal.  Thereinat, the Queen (Mother of All Adulterous Sleazy Scumbags) could have inspected the results, from her Balcony without leaving the Palace.  Just(ifiably ?) sayin'  Such is life,  Have a good one...  Stay safe.  ;-p  Ciao ;
To be fair, most plans involving the words “nuclear bomb” aren’t very good plans. Or plans involving the word “Yorkshire”, for that matter.
nuking one of the last wildernesses we have in the country, crazy
North York Moors. Not North Yorkshire Moors. 🙂
Having to put "not a good idea" in the thumbnail says a lot about society
Remember you have the benefit of looking back at mistakes - in denmark we call it "bagklog" sort of sayin benefit of hindsight
Quite often the people in power are certifiably insane.
Now I want to check back-in on parallel-universe goatee-wearing Tom Scott who, once he's sorted out his troubles with the military police after racing the tides on a motorbike, heads up to North Yorkshire to make a spectacular video about that time they nuked the middle of nowhere and it all went horribly awry.
This is a great story! Thanks Tom Also really pleased to see the National Archive - I used to cycle past it and never knew that's what it was, but recognised the building the instant you showed it.
We should start launching nukes at other planets and moons, just to see if anything cool happens.
-Sir, there is gas in this hole! -Take it out, we can store it somewhere so it can be used later on. -That''s great, where should we store it? -Check this out, we dig a hole in the ground, and store it there. 😐
Superpowers: Look at our achievements!  Their achievements: Nuked their own country
WELL.... IM GLAD THEY DIDNT NUKE ME :,)
YOOOO MY TOWNS IN A TOM SCOTT VIDEO!!!!
I don't get it, where does the soil/rock go when it's blow up. I can imagine the whole area being compressed into denser soil, perhaps even forming a hard solid layer inside from vaporised/molten rock.  But how big would it be?
Well that was one of the more bizarre true things that I've heard about in a while :)
Maybe we should be doing stuff like this in the middle of nowhere nowadays
can't wait for the british version of stalker with crumpets and tea instead of aks
Slough might have been a better location to explode an atomic bomb.
THIS A PLAN HATCHED BY DR EVIL !!!!
Great idea for Boris to pick up: gas and nuclear radiation to freezing post brexit UK
Absolute stupidity is all it can be called. Modern day fracking is in the same league of stupidity. Leave the earth's crust alone. Traditional mining has been abandoned or banned on the grounds CO2 emissions but idiots still want to inject high pressure water and gases into stable strata layers to release CO2 causing gas. Dumb and dumber FFS.
OK maybe I'm stupid, but if you nuke underground where does the rock go? And isn't there like a whole lot of pass that's generated, which I imagine would cause some serious damage as it tries to escape to the top of the earth?
That, my friends, is why we need slow bureaucracies everywhere.
we've got these nukes, what can we do with them... how about digging holes?    ugh.
The tea?
Now imagine what all kind of stuff is still classified, and the things our govts did that are even worse. Example: US govt declassified stuff regarding MK Ultra, but there’s still plenty that they refuse to declassify, even after FOI requests   How some folks blindly trust govt is beyond me…
Dropping a nuclear bomb on Bradford would lead to tens of millions of pounds worth of improvements.
Radioactive gas storage
Let me guess before watching: it would turn the place into pudding.
I don't think England is big enough for nuclear blasts
Obviously a jealous plan, concocted by a Lancastrian, to spoil Yorkshire.
I enjoyed this video very much thanks Tom 😁👍
Old folks sure liked nuking stuff didn't they
A love letter to North Yorkshire.
There was a similar story on the TV Show 'Mysteries at the Museum' about the US government attempting to set off a nuclear bomb just outside of an Alaskan town to see the effects that radiation had on people. I've been trying to find the episode and town that they were talking about, but I can't seem to find it.
That would have been really bad
"Let the atom be a worker..." was taken way too seriously.
Why aren't people using this tactic to make water storage lakes? For example, lets plow a path from a huge lake, rich in life, to a desert and create a mini lake there. Now you got yourself a rich lake in the middle of the desert that will undo the desertification!   Sometimes I feel like I was born in the wrong century. I'm too smart for today, I should been born in 1940. I'd solved all the worlds problems. The glaciers are melting? Nuke it into submission! No glaciers melting under my watch! You want a lake outside of your cabin? Nuke it however deep you want! Too many fish in the ocean? Nuke it! Too Few people on the moon? Nuke it!
Don't talk about /our/ space race, brit.
My mind was blown when you said the towns pickering and Whitby. As I live in Whitby, Canada ontario… the city next to me is also called, pickering 🤯
Possible Sites For An Nuclear Explosion In Yorkshire :  1. Leeds. That is all.😄
stvnnink ! nö ? ök nüke  ökäy stünnink -.-  xD
The "it was not a good plan" thumbnail definitively got me to watch this 😂
Is the document online?
you've merely scratched the surface of the Yorkshire nuke situation. Tread lightly Mr. Scott
Was i the only one that could feel his footsteps?
In a few more years, they will declassify the report, which says that the explosion really happened.
I know it was the 60's/70s but 164k for a nuke seems really cheap.
but why not, if its UK bomb and the UK weapons lobby profit....then by all means. SHOULD be detonated over, in UK! not for it, but much, much more fair then nuking some island, inhabited, too...lets be fair. UK, your bomb - your profit - your bang. hoping that the UK locals would go for a anti nuke treaty. the ONLY way...not shove ones rubbish and cancer deaths...on who?
Just the type of dumb idea Boris Johnson would come up with to divert attention from his multiple "parties".
👍👍
Now nobody would complain if bradford was used.
its a surprise mankind even survived the 60s.
Not such a secret anymore, is it now?
I've never understood where the missing rock is supposed to go. If you nuke a salt formation, do you end up with super-dense salt? A bit hard to believe it could exist - or at least, that it wouldn't instantly snap back.
I don't think anyone would have noticed anyway....
"Plan for Nuking Yorkshire"  Author: Lancashire  😁
well it isn't really top secret now
Thank you..
could do this with a moab?
Wow, you find out the most obscure crazy things. Love it. Thank goodness Common scence prevailed.  Keep up the good work God bless
Thanks for your content!👨🏻‍🚀
Brittan had no probs exploding dozens of nuclear bombs in Australia in the 50s.  They didn't tell the locals about that either.  Still fenced off.
So good at speaking in one take
uh oh
@2.47 Bomby Pickering
Food for algorithm ;-)
There might be a sort of undercurrent in this channel now. Use the GPT projects to start a script for alternate versions of Tom Scott, refine it and record it  This does legitimately feel like the forgotten British Mission to the Moon.
Much better to try this here in the US, we have plenty of space that nobody wants to live on.  Not quite so much open space in the UK
💖
I've been camping a few miles from that spot -- I would have been fracking annoyed.
wait... 1969 to explode a nuclear bomb to make Yorkshire pudding? NOICE
how would this result in a cavity? the stuff doesnt just disappear by the explosion? is the idea that its compactified and serve as walls of the tank?
I had a geology professor who worked on the gas stimulation project. Unfortunately they selected sandstone so created more or less a really big glass ball, which wasn't exactly porus.
Considering all the stuff I heard people planned to use nuclear bombs and radioactive elements for, can you imagine what life would be these days if it wasn't for ionizing radiation? Say it didn't affect us as much, or we had found some sort of all encompassing cure for any ill effects... like RadX/RadAway or something.
But what if they did and no one knew  Da da daaaaan
"what are you going to do with a few million gallons of highly radioactive water after you have flushed it?" ..........."err.."
should've done it anyway mate
I love your channel Tom and I know this isn't a unique question but I have to ask; will there be another series of Spooks?
Shame.
Did you actually check if there was a plug in the ground somewhere? Didn't see a squirrel with two heads or anything? :)
The French government at the same time proposed nuclear bomb testing on the west coast of Corsica after their test ground, Algeria, became independent. It never happened and so Tahiti was chosen instead!
i love this kind of super obscure ephemeral history
Going by the people I know from Pickering and Whitby; I think this plan must've gone ahead on the quiet.
Plot twist: Actually they did manage to do everything in secret.
I mean, we get to test and blow up nukes, which is always fun, and we rid the world of Yorkshire. Win-win.
Plot twist, there's a giant secret government facility below where Tom is standing because the nuke did happen
Why not try this in Slough?
I found this channel days ago and when I checked his age , I was surprised 😮
So… they wanted to use nukes when dynamite does the job just as well, if not better? I mean for starters dynamite wouldn’t contaminate the water with Radiation. Or any of the local land.
I’m not sure I’ve heard many phrases more terrifying that “nuclear fracking”
Given the amount of mutants lurking about in Scarborough, I wonder if they actually went ahead and did it.
detonating nuke is never a good idea

Clickbait bs. Well done Tom, you used to be good
Maralinga open air explosions by British and there were people living there 🇦🇺
The nuclear industry and its political allies never cease to come up with bad ideas.
Fingers crossed it’s Hull
I'm glad Yorkshire remains nuke-free
Absolutely crazy, well made video as always!
This channel is the very definition of "Chaotic Good" in terms of content.
This is probably one of the most masterfully done combinations of video title and thumbnail.
But instead they nuked Norfolk and that's why they're born with extra fingers and toes.
this video has 1,421,097 views
Where... Where did they think all the rock would go after the boom?
I'd call that "Yorkshire Pudding"
this is like the nasty version of carbon capture! 😯
In the USA, they did a few of these.  Most were in the West, but one that stands out as being in a "populated area" like this one was in Mississippi, about 25 km southwest of Hattiesburg.  They were looking at its effect on a salt formation and whether they could make a storage tank.
Your videos are amazing mate, Your production quality is unquestionable and your delivery hits perfectly. Keep up this amazing work.
start a podcast please it'd be nice to drive to work while listening to you making everything ever 100x more interesting
I read in the papers the other day, that Britain has something like 100 tons of plutonium laying around and they don't know what to do with it. So don't let Boris Johnson or some other lunatic from your government watch this video, or they might get some very bad ideas.
In an alternate universe they went ahead with the plan, but the nearby town was called Royston Vasey.
I feel bad for that national park though. Clear cuts and production forest as far as the --eye-- drone can see :(
i'm starting to see a thumbnail pattern here
I used to live 30ish minutes away from there I went to school in Whitby, this is so strange to hear
If only that planned bomb happened and accidentally drifted towards Leeds. I'd class that as a price worth paying.
I live in Scarborough, and frequently visit the the Yorkshire Moors. There’s a tale that there are still tunnels running through the dales, still to be discovered. Maybe it’s time to dig up some archives on go on more of many discovery hikes I have been partaking in through the Moors recently. It’s also home to RAF Fylingdales, an OTH radar. Used to be known for its distinctive golf ball-like radar balloons.
I don't understand how this technique would create a large cavity. Where does the excess rock go?
Would've created around ten billion pounds worth of improvements.
Not heard of contaminated water table then   some radio active isotope half life 1000 years what was the last line in the Eric idle song LETS HOPE THERES INTELLIGENT LIFE SOMEWHERE OUT IN SPACE COS THERES BUGGER ALL DOWN HERE ON EARTH
Amazing video Tom. Thank you for sharing this local history I never knew about.
I literally live in North Yorkshire so this scared me
The phrase "White heat of technology" was made famous (some would say a cliché) by Harold Wilson in 1963
Do you want Silurians? Because that is how you get Silurians.
we got big chemical toys now
How do we know they didn't actually do it?  As you say, there would be no change on the surface and the locals would only feel a rumble.
Nice video Tim!
I would guess they went ahead with the plan to explode nuclear bombs in Yorkshire, have you been to Rotherham, Hull and Doncaster?
1969 proves its not true
There were plans to donate one on one of the sea stacks near John O'Groats, but because of weather risks, the plan was moved to Skipsea in Yorkshire. That one got mentioned in Parliament, I believe.
I wonder if the engineers and scientists were Lancastrians.
Makes me wonder how many non-nuclear "just bomb it"-solutions were actually deployed without informing the local residents. That could be a video(series) on its own!
They were going to do it in Hull, until they realised it would cause Millions Of Pounds worth of improvements.
1965 film - Crack in the World… sending a thermonuclear missile into the earth to release geothermal energy…
Pity - the UK could've attempted to beat the world record for world's fastest manhole cover if they'd gone ahead with the plan. ...okay, I guess only one manhole cover exploring the cosmos is probably enough.
it would have done literally hundreds of pounds of improvements
"And the North Yorkshire Moors, thanfully, were never nuked" or you only think so... quite possible that other documents were not yet declassified 😎
I thought they nuked Sheffield for the film "Threads", not that it made any difference to the place... :P
thats sad i'm glad it wasnt a big affect to us in yorshire
I grew up on a farm exactly 5.5 miles from the marked site at the centre of the map at 2:09 and the primary school I attended is only 4.75 miles away. My family still live on that farm today and there is no other village/town/population centre between my family home and that site. I also went to secondary school in Whitby. North Yorkshire is a big place (by UK standards) so my jaw nearly hit the floor when I saw that map. When I saw the thumbnail for this video, I never imagined the site in question would be on my family's doorstep! It's wild to think that if this plan had been carried out, my family life as it goes on today, and my entire childhood as I remember it, might never have existed...
Spooky. I was there two days ago.
i think milton keynes would be the best place to detonate a nuclear bomb. wish they would hurry up
I was sure this would be one of the GPT3-generated videos
I don't understand this idea of making enormous underground cavities, where does all the rock go to?
@2:41 The very slight jitter when explaining the moment of the explosion is editing beauty.
They did actually go ahead with this project soon after, instead it was conducted on the south side of the Thames estuary - it all went very badly wrong and so they covered it up again with concrete and called it Thamesmead.
I remember the government did testing warheads and bombs into the side of  Weardale / County Durham off the A68 in a old quarry they exploded trains etc  secret testing  They had walls made up of hardened steel to test tanks  construction   a lot of research and development
Idk the idea of nuking England really isn't that bad... what's there to loose?

Mad that, used to pick magic mushrooms like 500 meters from this spot hehe
yorkshire? i hope it didn't affect the tea production in the area, oh noooo
Nuking a bit of North Yorkshire? Lucky this wasn't suggested under a Tory government, they wouldn't have even let the ink dry!
i clicked so fast i didnt even read the title. always great content
Wouldn't a nuclear bomb going off underground cause a huge amount of cracks to the surface? I struggle to see the result being a nice chamber full of rocks underground that you can carry out and a decent seal to store gas in, but I'm not a nuclear bomb trained construction engineer so I don't know.
Detonate it NOW!
Wow, with today's knowledge it's disturbing that they actually considered this I was also wondering: since this video came from declassified archive documents: did everybody's favourite Gary Brannan pitch this idea?
It was once said that a nuclear bomb dropped on my home town of Leicester would cause about £5 worth of damage.😁😁😁
I mean, just do it in Bradford. No harm, no foul
Well,it's not top secret anymore
What’s supposed to happen to all the rock that previously made up the cavern? Rock’s not noted for being that compressible. Does everything just move outwards a bit and stay there?
Ground cavities for gas will soon be in high demand again as Compressed Air Energy Storage may turn out to be the most cost efficient way to create large capacity grid energy storage.
Split the atom... and then wanted to use it for everything and anything...
nuclear bombs don't exist
this would make for a dark episode of the Last of the Summer Wine
Secret plan to finally stop Yorkshire once and for all.
They should try it in California. Just don't evacuate anyone though. It will be cheaper.
I can imagine "[...] further thought would be given [...]" is a British way of saying "This idea is bonkers and I will have no part in it."
Here's what terrifies me... this was back in the days when politicians listened to science experts. We live in a post truth society now where people treat reality like a propaganda game to suit their own agendas, listening to or dismissing experts on whims. What happens next time someone comes up with a plan like this, and some moron like trump or boris is in charge of the country. Someone who not only doesn't respect scientific counsel, but who actively believes batshit insane nonsense?
It's trending :0
We should try to nuke Yorkshire again
Halo @ Tom Scott. This is very comforting and now I know I’m not the only one 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
What if they really did it somewhere else but it's still classified because it's countries natural gas reserves. Hmmmm?
am i the only one who doesn't really see a problem with this if you can figure out how to deal with the whole radiation thing
I don't think detonating a nuclear bomb is ever really a good plan..
I wonder what camera he's using for filming. That camera has good image stabilisation.
That's right near my house, in fact that map at 2:08 has my house on it. Its great the hear something new about the place. Great video as always.
"Nuke a bit of a national park" is a phrase i never thought i'd hear.
We Yorkshiremen know that we are unpopular with the English - but this is really taking things too far!  The Harrowing Part 2.
if i had to test a nuclear bomb id probably test it in Yorkshire too
Don't tell @spiffingbrit
I wonder what modern plan people in ~50 years will say, "Crazy! I can't believe they did/considered that!"
During this covid pandemic we have found that many if not the vast majority will blindly follow what the Government says is 'Science'; we have to follow the science. Surprised it was not undertaken as if the scientists said it was a good idea then if you raised concerns you would personally been attacked and called a Nazi or a fascist or both ,
is there ANY insane idea that politicians will not consider?
Interesting
At least it’s North Yorkshire because I live in West Yorkshire. Now that I think about it though, it should be in West Yorkshire because it’s a shithole over here.
It would be slightly less harmful to the political career of any idiot who approved this if they climbed down into the hole with the nuke and let it off.  At least then they would not have to deal with the fallout of their decision.
Hey, let's contaminate and ground and ground water for... forever just so we don't have to dig holes. 👏 fantastic idea
if its top secret how do we know
I get the whole idea about using nukes as tools, but would that actually work? I mean, what happens to all the material around the explosion? All those just vaporize I assume. And if that is the case, won't that vapor escape, taking with it all the uranium particles that didn't undergo fission, plus all the nasty byproducts that come with a nuclear explosion, effectively polluting everything around it? Or it doesn't vaporize, it gets pushed, and condensed into some super hard, glass like material, that also contains all the uranium bits that didn't undergo fission, plus the byproducts. And that is the walls of your gas tank now. That is either a very insane, or very clever idea. I can't decide which.
Who ever created this as a weapon, and those who used it, earned themselves a special place.. In hell
true plan was to seperate the island from the scots! :p
Goverments are good at biting hands that are feeding them
I feel like this would be something that vault tech from the fallout video games would do
Why wouldn’t they just regular bombs?
Nukes are a hoax!
There was actually a proposal to use nuclear explosions to excavate a canal from the south of Australia to the north. Fortunately, cooler heads prevailed and we upgraded the railway instead.
Not so top secret now
Bruh, the UK is way to small for nuclear testing.
Great research Tom ;)
Well, we can safely say it's NOT top secret anymore.
This would have damaged my old house !!
Yo
Looking at Bradford it is possible to believe that this was the site of a nuclear explosion.
"They decided not to proceed with the idea" ... as far as you know :/
Not secret anymore!
ofc its in yorkshire..
Didn't the Russians (Soviets?) put out a fire in an oilfield with a nuke somewhere way back?
I somehow misread this as "*My* top secret plan" and was very confused, somewhat scared, but mostly very curious.
Canada’s Pickering has a nuclear power plant, so it’s a good place for a nuclear project.
You really are a legend!! I appreciate all your videos and keep me connected to my home back in the UK! Love that you keep exploring how epic our little island is!! But for now.. il try to do my best in New Zealand with your inspiration!
Wait...there are forests in England? Noice. Didn't know that.
Shush Tom, Boris might see this and, well, wiff waff, jumpers for goal posts, let's nuke the north, or let's use nukes to build HS2. Now party time, sorry I mean business meeting... 🤣🤣🤣
This shows how trawling dusty old files can lead to an interesting video.
...as far as you know.
"Science isn't about why, it's about why not?"
To be honest the place doesn't look that great, are you sure they didn't nuke it yet?
Hi
Try Kenya...
I love how your videos aren't titled with clickbait. This is exactly what the vids about. Great job!
MOON LANDING. COME ON, GET REAL !  100% NEVER HAPPENED. PMSL that people still believe this lie
O
wait WHAT !?!
This might be a silly question, but where was all the rock meant to go? When you detonate a bomb underground, the material has to go somewhere.
Why not just use normal bang stuff like TNT
Is that Dalby Forest?
Those lead in the fuel really made people in the 70s taking stupid decision aren't they?
people back then legitimately thinking an atomic bomb is a CTRL+A DEL device
Interesting
I think we need to rename this to the not so secret, 11 on top trending lel
Fallout devs: "Write that down! Write that down!"
"It was not a good idea"? Spoilers!
Happy Valentines Day - Say it with ... NUKES!
Dear Tom, are you checking what’s aired on Swedish television, because I did just yesterday see a documentary about technology of war spilling over to civil use and the Plowshare program was mentioned as was the artificially created water reservoir in Soviet Union created by a nuclear blast. However that artificial lake is still very much radioactive. PS. There were plans for developing nuclear bombs in Sweden and testing them in Lapponia, but we didn’t go down that road, fortunately.
Well, look at the Bikini Atoll and French Polynesia.. is that where you think we should set off nukes?
A video idea that never went anywhere. So a visit to see Gary Brannan then.  Hes my favourite.
i have a question: I don't understand where the material would go to, that once qould have been earth and stone and then should have been a void in a cavern? If the explosion doesn't simply throw everything high up in the air?
Boris would have tried this
Why should a cavern be the result of the explosion ? The earth, the material, is still there after the explosion and not really compressible. Either the surface lifts, but if we have so many cracks that the surface lifts, it may equally well collapse afterwards. And considering that an atomic bomb creates quite a considerable earthquake, other natural cavitys may collapse as well and leak the radioactivity outwards.
I say detonate it right in the middle of city centre, get rid of those northerners.          might as well do the south while you're at it.
yikes!!
as if anyone would even think of doing that.
I mean, it is Yorskhire after all. They can sell the explosions to the tourists.
It would have been funny if some mad scientist ignite an atom bomb during tom's video
Inlex better
Its not a good plan for environmental system and underground tectonic plate.
Pickering? They named a whole town after that guy?
That’s alright, they deployed a few nukes in Australia. The reconciliation with indigenous folks is still ongoing.
As a proud Lancashireman and thus hereditary enemy of Yorkshire, I think this might be a little extreme!
Modern Technology & Nuclear destroy world
Should have dropped it on Bradford
The fact someone one day came out up with the idea to nuke their own country to make a storage space and no one immediately shot them down concerns me.
Would a cavern be created? What would happen to the thousands of tonnes of displaced earth?
Doesn't surprise me, the UK government has been wanting to nuke the North since Nukes were invented
I've walked that path a few times doing the Lyke Wake Walk,... next time I do it I'll have a fun fact for my friends!
Maybe, just maybe we should look if there were some minor earthquakes there in the last few decades. ;)
when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.
Hell no they make the Yorkshire tea there
did gary find this?
Scary but cool
Why not use a normal bomb to do this though? Why did it have to be a nuke?
Did Tom get a new camera, because it’s looking crisp!
not in my back yard... but the atols are fine.
Boom. boom, boom. There is your nuke canal.
That's very close to my In-laws place
They should nuke Insulate Britain road-blockers
Haha, the 'Golden Hammer' anti-pattern. When you have a very powerful hammer, everything looks like a nail!
The North Yorkshire Moors.... wait, you don't have classified documents privileges do you? Then no, they were never nuked.
Haha love it. How do you get to do this as a job now, mad world we live in
"Evacuate the thousand or so people that live nearby..."   Enemas for everyone! 😳
And then the British, blerss them, exported this idea to a remote location in Australia, there's still a mess in that area here...
I feel like the amount of work needed to create a nuke and then blow it up deep underground is at least as much work as it would be to just dig out a big hole
So when Radio 5 reported on North Yorkshire's decision to carry out an underground nuclear test, in 2009, they might have actually been on to something...
Haven't watched the video yet, just wanted to say that the thumbnail is amazing.
Peaceful nuclear explosions. I am struggling to get past that statement.
Or maybe it was nuked, at 2:18 you can see the hatch covered as a tree stump 😂
Wait. So they didn't detonate a nuclear bomb in Yorkshire?
As a history undergrad I am extremely envious of Tom being able to casually stroll up to the British National Archives and sieve through the documents I can only wish of accessing (due to costs and covid)
You should have kept this quiet, there's bound to be some swivelled eye Tory brexit loon who thinks this is a great idea.
Thankfully is not that many people that have access to more money than sense, but still a problem today?
The last thing Whitby needs is a nuclear explosion underground, they're already overrun by Goths, they don't need ghouls adding to that.  I jest of course but it's interesting that they chose a site that by my standards is close to some very historic locations and is probably quite close to the river Esk right?
"Peaceful nuclear explosions." What an oxymoron.
Great video has always Scott.   But people are deffinatly going to steal this and make their own video's.
shame yorkshire deserves a bomb
Why is their a pipe coming out of the ground behind Tom?
A 25kt detonation underground seems like a great way to get rid of those damn rodents in my yard. Someone hook me up with one of those bombs.
There must have been some freaky drugs floating around political spheres in the 1960s.
Such feels watching the from a Pacific island. Europe did their testing here instead.
Why use nukes for that instead of normal bombs, that don't explode radiation into the air?
Couldn't they have chosen underneath somewhere like Barnsley so at least if something went wrong then it wouldn't be a huge loss?
Jesus christ tom, i just had an exam about nuclear power, this vid would ve been great in there damnit
It was a good plan if you’re from Lancashire.
Further proof that governments are nuts.
There are still billionaires in Australia who want to do this.
Has anyone successfully created a cavern by this method? If so, can we see what it looks like? Where does all the... stuff go? Is it vaporized? And if so, how come that doesn't get blown out somewhere?
I'm glad to see that logged-flat National Parks aren't unique to the State's. ("Here. We're done with it")
nuclear fracking  mmhhh yessss
Barmy, crazy, irresponsible, ridiculous, risky, hazardous, reckless, insane. All these synonyms could have been irrelevant if only they had planned this in Lancashire.😜
Very interesting indeed
I guess the Maclads from  will have to find another way then.
Ah.  Human beings.
You say £9m and it is cheap, is that taking the cost of the nuclear bomb into account too? I dont imagine they would be cheap.
I recommend Bradford for ground zero 👌
if they did tell the locals as soon as they found out it was a nuke of any kind no matter how safe it actually is they'll have fear a nuke is being detonated within 100 miles of them
Fun fact: Tom was actually researching the dream of a socialist utopia in North Yorkshire and stumbled upon this.
This idea is... Objectively... Bad...
This is all very interesting news to me.
That would've been an amzing topic for citation needed
🙌🙌🙌 Yay!!!
So England did it in Australia instead.
I'm curious how they planned to remove the nuclear waste
I guess what I'm confused about is if the surface is undisturbed then where does all the rock go when the explosion happens?
1 million views in 16 hours? Tom is really crushing it
what about the 12 nuclear bombs they were going to set off in skipsea east yorkshire, during the cold war, it was only abandoned when churchill put a stop to it, one of the bombs was gonna be detonated in all saints church, skipsea would of been vapourised, it's all there in public records if you don't believe it,   & you think some of todays scientists are a bit flakey
I've been out to the New Mexico Project Gnome site, but I didn't think the UK was quite nuke crazy enough to consider similar projects.    With modern geological exploration techniques, they could probably find ideal soil conditions to successfully make storage chambers.  Unfortunately, people tend to be a bit against nuclear explosions now.
Last I heard (though I vaguely recall something about one of them being decommissioned), there were actually two _drink8ng water_ storage tanks that the Soviets had made with nukes, and then continued to use into at least the 90s. After the initial flush (not sure I want to know what _that_ did), there was so little contamination in comparison to the throughput of the tanks that it didn't pose a safety hazard. However, it _also_ likely was done with thermonuclear devices instead of pure fission devices, and thus much cleaner than anything "Hiroshima scale".
The word is alternative, not alternate
The fact that building a nuclear bomb and setting it off was considering cheaper than just digging a hole kinda baffles me, I’d assume a nuke to be way more costly but idk.  Still very interesting nonetheless!
I really love the UK secrets policy. I wonder what any one could get here if asks for the "alleged" spanish plutonium production in the 70's ...
my question is: Wouldn't the hole have just collapsed after the bomb went off?
looking back on it no matter humanities future i dont think we are ever going to look back at the discovery of nuclear manipulation (ie bombs powerplants ect) as the greatest advancement in human history instead of these giant nukes and powerplants i think that honor will go to something else i think its gonna go to the computer the microchip the circuit.
The idea of using a nuke to dig a canal is 1) obviously very optimistic about the fallout that comes from a surface detonation, but also 2) betraying a woeful ignorance of basic shapes.
It ain’t very top secret anymore 🧐
Do it
honestly, if nuclear fallout and radiation wasn't an issue we probably would be using nukes to do large scale digging, like the canals.
Another seemingly brilliant idea from not so long ago was to use microwave energy in homes to warm the people rather than the structure 🤪
imagine being told you have to evacuate ur house because some people wanna detonate a nuke “hey sir we’re gonna need you to evacuate for a little while.” “why whats going on?” “ohhh its nothing too bad we’re just gonna detonate a nuke underground a couple miles that way”
Interesting
It baffles me to no end, that someone actually had to be told that nuking a national park is a bad idea!
Interesting but would it really leave a big cavernous space? I mean structurally how big could it be before it would collapse under the weight of the earth above?
I decided to interpret this as: "the government once wanted to nuclear bomb Whitby".
You know, i always liked the "can do" positive attitude that was present in the Fallout game series, especially after all blew up...  :-)
I just don't understand how such braindead plans ever come to fruition. Actually that's a lie, it's always greed. Lead pipes were used because it was cheaper. And I guarantee that using nuclear bombs to build trenches or to store gas underground only come about because it was significantly cheaper.
Of all the places to detonate a nuclear bomb… why Yorkshire? Lancashire is just next door.
2:47 threw me off there, I sometimes forget that the local towns near me of Pickering and Whitby in Ontario Canada were named after places in the UK😂
I don't remember if you have talked about it before (it might have been a different YouTuber, Scott Manley perhaps) but there was a us project to test the effects of radiation on seeds by placing them on the outskirts of nuclear blast, it's actually responsible for high fructose corn syrup being viable.  They even let people submit their own seeds.
Just look at the bikini atoll disaster...
Going through archives to find something for another video, you say? Does this by any chance involve a non-existing Welsh town?
tom, the nuke is in your head
what is gas storage
Here's my idea. Dig a hole. Throw a nuke in it. Keep throwing nukes into them till you reach the center of the Earth. Uh... now you're there and can do something cool, right?
Hmm, with a bomb designed with a very short-duration radiation signature, this could actually work.   Plot twist:  they DID do it, and there are no obvious signs at the surface.  :)
Tom, what are they smoking when exploding a bomb there?
For some reason, immediately upon seeing this video on my feed, i assumed the idea was Tom’s.
Yorkshires stunning natural beauty. Plantations of non native trees and deforested Hill farms full of invasive sheep. It's a wonder biodiversity in the UK can be falling like a lead balloon when the whole place has natural beauty.
No no, they've got it all wrong, C4 is the way to go
Tom ! I'd love to see you dissect conspiracies. Your concise and informative delivery would be a great take on some more bizarre mysteries throughout history. One such that comes to mind is the Banjawarn Station seismic disturbance of 1993. Supposedly, a cult mined Uranium in outback Western Australia and may have made a small nuclear device!
Spent a lot of time wandering around that area I’m glad they never nuked it
It started to be a bad idea at the "detonate a nuclear bomb" part. Nuclear weapons are an atrocity upon the human race. A physical manifestation of how evil human kind can be.
Why nuke a national park and not a place like slough
I'll be honest it's still not too late to nuke Yorkshire
The South hates the North.
Operation Northridge says slot, Google it if ur curious Or it's northwoods one of em
Considering that dynamite  revolutionised  construction, and that it was an adaption of  a weapons technology, I can see how they got the idea. New weapon, bigger weapon = new more powerful construction technology?
I thought the title said " *my* plan to set off a nuclear bomb in yorkshire" and i was a bit scared
Look for references in Russian history,  I'm sure they took it further.
Bruh
In 1968 I was present at a project plowshare simulated nuclear blast. They had bleachers set up but placed them too close to the blast site. When debris started raining down on the crowd everyone grabbed their kids, scrambled for their cars and raced away. The test was code named “pre-gondola” and conducted near fort peck in Montana.
So it was a good decision not to nuke Yorkshire, but as it happened fine to nuke the colonials in Oz.   Our sycophantic PM Menzies thought it perfectly reasonable to turn our country into a science experiment. There is an excellent book "Maralinga by Frank Walker, if you want the story.
Were these 'scientists' Lancastrians by any chance?
👍 Tom is a perfect example that anything that needs to be said can be said in 5 minutes.   The videos are short, to the point, no long winded diatribes, no self aggrandizement, no personal politics..... just sticks to the facts and says what needs to be said. 😃
Eeh by gum!
Don't spin with your camera. Thanks
Read about "project cauldron" which is the story about the time Canada almost nuked the oil sands...
One-Way To-Make YORKSHIRE ... 'Pudding'!!!??? >(*U^)< (Joke) *Wink*
Amusingly, I spent a few years living near towns called Pickering and Whitby, which were about ten miles apart from each other - and not in the United Kingdom. Also, glad to find someone had the sense *not* to nuke a still-inhabited-and-inhabitable part of Britain at that point.
anyone else played Life is Strange: True Colors and being reminded of that story?
Why videos thamnails and titles of this channel are becoming so wierd ?
Noticed reforestation in the park . I know GB cut all its trees down a few times in history  Would Be a good story  if the entire country is trying to get the forests back
so youre saying they create the grotto from fortnite in real life?
Probably happened in the fallout universe...
And the cavern would probably have collapsed forming a surface crater.
I wonder if they were going to have chickens inside the case of this bomb like Project Blue Danube... The only thing missing besides the chickens is a plan to leap out of a giant badger... Yep! Meanwhile, back in the the USA during the Radiant Fifties and Sixties, the project was called Gas Buggy. And you can visit TODAY those capped off radioactive gas wells...  Thank God nothing else became of it. "Nukes for peace" is always akin to farting in a Pup Tent.
Sunderland would've been a better choice! 🤔
Cheer up, Scott. The North York Moors were never nuked *so far* but one day that might change.
Lisa Simpson: Nuke the Yorkshire?!  Tom Scott: Gotta nuke something.
And yet, people do wonder why we are skeptical to new science and engineering??? Sometimes I’m amazed that the most trivial flaws are overlooked by scientists and us engineers. Just like with the jab that it only targets the spike proteïne, which mutates the fastest… and wonder why people still got C19… and the efficacy goes down so rapidly.  Logic and reasoning is something most scientists and engineers start to overlook because they/we are lost on details and can’t step back and have a pragmatic look — blinded by our well meant goals. Of course gas would be irradiated, it’s a molecule that gets electrons stripped of by the ionizing effect and thus become unstable!!! Duh! And irradiated gasses are far more dangerous than rocks soil as you can inhale them.
If they blew up Whitby where would the rich people from Harrogate go on their holidays?
Did you say "near Kettering"? I fancy the thought of a radioactive James Acaster is the stuff of "Tales from the Crypt" nightmares. Legend!
So Yorkshire is England's Nevada?
Top-secret? Public now
Alright all you London Lads…where should we test a nuke?  YORKSHIRE!!
Bro. This is literally like. Raven’s Gate by Anthony Horowitz. XD
That’s nuclear fracking crazy!
Amazing story!   I can imagine all of the Yorkshiremen growling into their beer, saying something like "Eeee baah gum......"........  :)
Awesome video
Nice vid
This is how we do our earth quakes in california. Wait for steady shift hits the unbalanced plate to keep a chisels boom and. Try to understand the ground and if caves are giving off natural gas and make the floor. Treble shake and not so much a half inch drop.
It's grim oop nort'
I get the feeling that a certain prominent archivist of the Yorkshire area and everybody's favorite Gary Brannan would like to have a copy of that document for his archives.
Would be cool but not cool at the same time
Interesting  !!!
No Tom. Your jaw did not litteraly dropped.
This plan was clearly conceived by Londoners, who rather than explode a nuke and build a gas tank under Buck House, tried to do so as near Scotland as possible. It was only abandoned because the UK's Operation Ploughshare was too hard to spell.
bill gate : "I choose a lazy person to do a hard job. Because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it." lazy person : use nuke to dig hole for giant gas storage
If it "didn't" happen why is there concrete well cap in the middle of a national park. Right in the spot that they thought about doing the test?
When you said Pickering and Whitby I had to do a double take - they are two towns/cities in Ontario right next to each other, near Toronto. And Pickering, funnily enough, is the location of a nuclear power plant!
Very informative and entertaining thx tom u the best and no im not a bot lmao
It's like not Tom Scott
In hindsight, pure nutters.
Nah blow up Birmingham
I never thought of something as frightening as Nuclear fracking...
but it was
they should’ve done it
Also in 1969 there was a plan to use a nuclear device to create an artificial harbor in remote Western Australia to assist in BHP's mining activities. Luckily they decided it wasn't worth it economically.
Oh Lord... Yorkshire Terriers are already disagreeable by nature... could you imagine the terror that "Peaceful Nuclear Mutant Yorkies" would have inflicted on the world?! There are always unforeseen consequences even worse than the most dire predictions.
“Yorkshire moors were never nuked” , pity the same thing can’t be said about Montebello island or  Maralinga… are not to worry that’s just Australia
reminds me when the soviets stopped an oil well blowout using a nuke
Was Luton unavailable or something? Shame.
Nuking Yorkshire could only improve the place....
Tom can I just say I love u
Sweet...
On the plus side if the radiation caused genetic mutations in the population of Yorkshire it's unlikely anybody would have noticed.😁
Very 'Yes Minster'
Pickering and Whitby UK are ~35km apart. Pickering and Whitby Canada are ~15km apart, with a nuclear plant in Pickering; be wary of discussing nuking Pickering lest you get some wide-eyed Ontarians.
Kaboom
glad i wasn't born with ten fingers
NOT THE TEA
"...and the North Yorkshire moors, thankfully, were never nuked."  Fair enough for the moors.  *But they still know what they did.*
There were also a lot of plans for 'wacky' (apocalyptic) thing in Scotland. For a while it was considered running a less efficient grid by placing all the nuclear plants up north in case something went wrong, or by building several plants in the highlands and migrating heavy industry up there, again to keep it away from London if something went badly wrong (which at the time was considered a genuine possibility)
How would nuclear caverns like this not collapse back in on themselves?
bruh they should’ve done it it would’ve been funny
Yorkshire Yoga
we need a plan to detonate a nuclear bomb in south florida, specifically, under the  golf  course at MaroLago.
"were never nuked."   ... that we know of.  How do we know they didn't do it (or something like it, maybe somewhere else) and just use it for something else?   Just asking...  ;-)
The UK has nuked the USA more times than the US nuked Japan
Congrats to UK 🇬🇧 for figuring out it was a bad idea WITHOUT trying it, unlike SOV 🇷🇺  & 🇺🇸.   Now question is, what did France 🇫🇷  do?
But.. why there?
Then, 50 years later, a US President wanted to nuke a hurricane...
They were gonna turn Yorkshire into pudding
Now lets think about this calmly... Who would want to nuke Yorkshire? ... I bet the bloke that came up with this scheme was from Lancashire.  ;-)
How many decisions are being made right now without the full understanding necessary for good decisions.   I'm sure none of the people considering that plan were evil villains.   They were trying to find optimal solutions with cutting edge tech.  What decisions currently being made are analogous, I wonder.
Did you ever cover Atomic Gardening?
whats the arrow for
I wish you would make more videos, I think you are the most interesting youtuber I have ever watched, and even better than most TV presenters. Thank you for all your hard work on researching for these videos Tom, you always make my week when I see you've released a new video.
“How do we get the war to end” “We should just Nuke ourselves”
2:48. Lmfao. Bro. They just straight up ripped those names and slapped em where I live.
As an adopted son of Sheffield (South Yorkshire) I’m very much in favour of nuking North Yorkshire. Preferably Leeds.
2:53 not really an accurate depiction of whitby, tho that is a part of the town that exists so IG it isn't wrong.
“Peaceful nuclear explosions” just doesn’t sound right to me
"Well, you just need a little bit of insanity and some maths."* was that the motto of this people?   *quote from: Kurzgesagt - in a nutshell
Would'nt have put it past the UK government to blow up the north.
"Never Nuked", that we know of...
This has the same vibe of people trying to harvest energy from lighting
Yep hope Biden administration gave his bunker code to 81 million people because we're about to see a few.
Alright, but why a nuclear bomb? Why not hydrogen?
The Soviets used a nuclear device to stop a wildly unstoppable oil or gas well fire. They drilled a deep tube adjacent to the well and detonated the device so the well was crimped shut.  Not sure what the long term effects were, but it was quite a clever idea.
1:03 boom boom boom, and there's your nu-kenal!
Maybe now comes a report saying it happened
Amazing video!! One critique: when you did the spinning shot to show the setting what I think was camera stabilization made the shot really dizzying. Loved the story though
THEY DID NUKE YORKSHIRE, and called the area Halifax. SHITHOLE
There are many cities in Yorkshire that, to be fair, could only benefit from a few kilotons of urban regeneration 🤨
If you’d nuked Yourkshire you would have ended up in a pudding!
weird to think how different society might be if nukes didn't have the issue of lingering radiation
There's still talk of making underground "bubbles" on Mars!
can we carry out this nuclear explosion idea today? but an airburst, above Bradford..
I knew there had to be others besides the US and the Soviets who had been looking into it. I wouldn't be surprised if the French and Chinese have old plans that never came to fruition either tucked away in some cabinet somewhere.
I'm willing to bet the surprisingly affordable cost of this doesn't include the bomb, which I'm guessing would be provided for free by the secret-budget sections of the government.
Awesome when you mentioned capping the drilled hole it made me think of operation plumbob. In the states I did a similar thing of blowing up underground and the concrete cap may have been the fastest thing ever created by humans.
Boom baby!
Should have ended the video with the closing montage of Dr. Strangelove for Valentine’s Day.  Missed opportunity.
This is on the same plane as Brexit, sorry.
£9 million of improvements to Yorkshire going begging and it never happened in the end, typical! 😢
It always seems a good idea until the "What if" becomes the "Then what?"
do you think instead of Yellow cake Uranium they would have called it Yorkshire Pudding?
Tbf I think a nuke would make most of Yorkshire look better. Rotherham could do with a casual nuclear explosion
Given the date: "E up luv, did t' Earth move for thee?" "Nay, it were just that nuclear bomb again."
In the unlikely event that there is still somone working on this and given that the odds of them finding this video is almost 100% let me just say it's a horrible idea don't do it.
It's really a shame that the British did not decide to use this area for underground nuclear testing, rather than coming to my country, doing a dubious deal with the government of the day and setting off atmospheric nuclear explosions that killed aboriginal people in the outback and saw nuclear dust fall over several cities...
How do you know they were never nuked though?
0:03 You telling me thats NOT the set of a Star Trek Next Generation episode? I know they filmed at a water treatment works and that looks very similar to it.
They shoulda fuckin done it anyway
Still not as mental as the USA plan to use nuclear explosions to space travel 😬
...yet
“Tha’s tellin’ me they tried to blow up a bomb in t’ Yorkshire woods? Bit o’ a daft thing to do in’t it?”
Why was the nuclear device so cheap?
Nuclear power is still our friend. Failsafes must triple.
Wish they would have done it. They could have assisted in studies to reduce future potential peaceful fuel reactor accidents/incidents.
I guess having an Archivist friend would lead you to some interesting things.
Oh, all the good ideas folks come up with until they figure out how bad the idea actually is
Probably a stupid question but if they were thinking of experimenting with Nuclear explosions to create caverns and storage wells, was there a reason why dynamite or another less radioactive explosive material wasn't considered? There would likely be more rock and rubble to remove after the initial explosion than with nuclear power however wouldn't that be better than trying to clean up radioactive waste?
1:08 "nuclear fracking" is a term i have never heard before and never, ever want to hear again
I'm glad that never happen either Tom!!!  🙂🚂🚂🚂
What socks were you wearing during the filming of this Tom? Something fashionable?
I wonder if this would be feasible if we had pure fusion nukes.
this is like something a cartoon super villain would come up with
Bloody southerners
Tbh, using one over Scunthorpe/Yorkshire would be doing the County a favor
It's actually a reasonable question.
Come on, what could possibly go wrong? 😅
Good old British bureaucracy. While the Americans and Russians were out doing it, the British were busy talking about it. Cheers for civilized debate.
I saw an American 60s promotional video about the wonders of nuclear excavations. Frightening
164 grand for a nuke seems quite reasonable!
Nuclear landscaping! One of greatest ideas of mankind that was fortunately not implemented. Yet...  The Soviets had plans to nuke canals to redirect Siberian rivers into the Kazakh steppe. What could possibly go wrong? Except for such minor issues as a tilted earth axle?  Didn't know Britain actually had plans to try this at home. As far as I know Britain is slightly more populated than Kazakhstan or Siberia. Okay one or two of such experiments could have fixed this... /o\
very interesting
How do we know that they didn’t do it ?
Uh... they could've just asked Japan if it was a bad idea or not to use nukes for any purpose other than massive eradication and suffering of life. Wouldn't have taken them 25 years to figure out then. Stupid.
With humanity having detonated over 2000 nuclear bombs on this planet already, every square inch of earth now has radioactive particulates throughout. I think they should start figuring out how to fix what they have done before they decide to carelessly detonate more radioactive material.
doesn't seem that would remain a secret very long...
It's so top secret
I heard that Fred Gurley, president of the Santa Fe Railroad at about the same time as the records you noted, wanted to use nukes to grade rights-of-way for railroad construction.  This was also at the same time that Santa Fe Railroad was a corporate sponsor of the Disneyland Railroad (and one of the locomotives was named in Gurley's honor), so there's that connection too....
Those little Plowshare animations look like something straight out of the Fallout games (though I realise it's actually the other way around). Except in Fallout it was satire, and not a particularly subtle one.
Did the USA or USSR ever try this type of nuclear testing?
Makes you wonder what sort of things are happening right now that we'll look back on in 30 years and think, 'OMG, what were they thinking'.
4:41 say that 10 times fast.
I feel like I've heard about this before, maybe on Qi
£9 million to set off a nuke in a national park is scarily cheap - thank god they never did it
If this declassified document makes your jaw drop what would operation Northwoods do
Wait, can someone explain to me how this would create a cavity? Where does the dirt in that area go? It can't just be annihilated. Would there be a hill too afterward?
It's quite scary for me as my house is shown in the video 😅 In Pickering
An interesting thought. I wonder if anyone thought about using a nuke to frack for gas in the offshore gas fields back in the day?
You could do an article on the nuclear fire they had in Telford where they kept the nuclear bombs.
boom..
Would certainly put a modern spin on the Harrying of the North
Ideas like this make perfect sense.  When the future knows this was a bad idea, the present is responsible to find out why.   "Hey I have an idea.  Here is all the details."   "This seems like a really bad idea due to x, y and z." "Ah good point.  Moving on."
Imagine pitching this to the ministers :D
"It would be hard to hide"   BOOM!!  What was that?!   What was what?  That boom!  What boom?  I didn't hear any boom?...  (Monty Python would be perfect for this)
A non nuclear disaster, did more damage to a lot bigger area than N. Yorkshire, and had crossed the Prime Minister's desk, took place in June 2016.
Can somebody edit the sound clip for his nuclear explosion impression @ 2:40 into clips of real nuclear explosions? That's got to be the most accurate nuclear explosion impression I've ever heard in my life.🤣
I’m imagining an alternate timeline where Tom is at the bottom of this giant unground cavern talking about the failed attempt to make underground gas storage with a nuke
In Michigan a gravel pit was dug that drained people's water-wells.  It dried them up for a mile radius.  There probably would have been unexpected consequences from such an explosion.
Very pedantic point but it's the North York Moors not North Yorkshire Moors. Great video though!
I very much enjoy the documentary "To Mars by A-Bomb: The Secret History of Project Orion", it's very easy to find online with a quick search.  It details how far not just the theoretical research went but even the practical experiments that were carried out to see if peaceful nuclear explosions were a viable alternative to the methods of rocket propulsion, at the time.
Somewhat close to where I grew up.
Considering nuclear science and medicine had been around a long time before then - just not for making weapons - it is scary to think some idiots working at multiple governments considered letting off such bombs as an alternative to TNT, totally forgetting about the radiation part.
I live in Dorset and if we nuked Boscombe you wouldn’t be able to tell the difference 😉
It already looks like a nuclear wasteland. This is a forest in the UK?
Late 90s, I saw declassified documents that had similar discussions elsewhere. It wasn't really my area of interest so I didn't read them further. One thing I think we can be sure of- this was never really about gas storage, which was just a convenient excuse. This was about testing weapons, nothing more.  The amount of things that we've seen declassified in the time since I worked in a gov. department is incredible. The idea that there is not an equal amount of 'interesting' things going on behind the scenes today is hard to believe. Tom Scott's grandchildren will have a hell of a good time going through 2022's declassified documents.
Hopefully Boris won't see this video. Might get used for HS2.
I'll takes "Things I never expected" for 500, Alex .... holy moley.
Fascinating. *insert Spock GIF*
My god, there would have been meat and potatoe pies splattered al over the rest of the country!
Makes me think a bit of Edge of Darkness and its nuclear secrets in coal mines 🤔
Cool
So, was it like the Chernobyl explosion, except it never happened?
They just tested in Australia instead 😒
That's just how Bradford has always looked
1960’s France grossly underestimated the true damage of underground nuclear testing. Similarly recent declassified documents show Scientists of the day were so keen, they chose to downplayed the worst case scenario of fallout by 90%. Even then the rough contamination timescales were off by multiples of 100’s!  No wonder so many people supported CND, Greenpeace, etc. (and no wonder French government spies bombed such activists).
Tom is one of the few that can make a video about a place wehre nothing happened and keep it super interesting
Hello from Pickering
Great video Tom :) just fyi, it’s North <York> Moors rather than North <Yorkshire> Moors when you’re talking about the National Park - so called because they’re north of York, rather than because they’re in North Yorkshire…
By Gum lad, I din't knaw deease Southerners'd try to blaw uz up
I'd like to think that the 25K in miscellaneous costs on the projected cost is just the Nuke they would have to procure.
Living in Doncaster this might of been an improvement
Not the best timing for this kind of Video 😬😬
inshallah
I have an ide
Spiff will not be happy to hear about this
The level of radioactivity produced by nuclear fracking was really low. It was politically unfeasible to use the resource produced by the experiments in New Mexico. The background radioactivity is now almost at a natural level but it's use is still prohibited. If we as a state were smart we would build a NG power station near the one of the sites & be able to use the fuel for about 1000 years.
Yorkshire ❤️
Ahh I expect the detonation actually happened and this explains the Yorkshire people.  :)
Until you know all the environmental risks, it's not an irrational idea to consider.  They thought about it, fleshed out the major details, and then shelved it pending further review.  In other words, exactly what they should have done, given the data at the time.  Fascinating, and thanks, Tom.  But neither shocking nor horrifying.
poor dog
Nuke Yorkshire. Mmm...Can't see a problem really 😀
That park is gorgeous
Meanwhile, somewhere in North Korea... "Seems like a goo idea..." BOOM!
dang that's scary
huh? can you actually make a giant cavity in the ground with a nuke? I thought that juat collapses... where does the rock go anyways? does it raise the ground?
As an Australian, I find it darkly amusing that British people think that it would be a bit unpleasant to set off nukes in your backyard...
Tom only really thinks this is a bad idea because it's in Yorkshire. If it was in Lancashire, he'd be all over it.
They just wanted to mine for some copper
No drip
Only 9 million ok. An exploration hole down there will cost about 1 million alone.
“Nuclear fracking”? How could that possibly go wrong!
Mad to see my hometown of Pickering on YouTube let alone in a Tom Scott video with nuking as the subject 😆.   Glad to see the distant sign of Dirty Dave’s kebab shop at the end of Castlegate in the second shot 😅.  I mean granted it’s a mad idea underground nuking the moors it could’ve been great to see on the North Yorks Moors railway line 😅.
Apparently the blatantly obvious was NOT in fashion then.  Not in the US either.
If something like this actually happened in an alternate universe, that world would be a completely different place to say the least.
All Creatures Great, Small and Mutant
Hey, you writers who make stories involving secret bunkers and bases for illumnati/secret governments to operate out of: here's a great idea for a Britain-based one.
Threads!
lmfao I never knew there was 2 Pickering's, there's one in Canada as well
"Tom Scott plus MI6"
Incredible, thanks for the research!
You missed Eisenhower’s nuke project “ATOMS FOR PEACE”  Which Thom Yorke of Radiohead used to named a spin-off band!
1969…
Are you sure it wasn't the real story of how the Welsh came to be?
Good video. but there is no such thing as the North Yorkshire Moors National Park, it's North York Moors National Park!
Yes.
Hoping that the author wasn't from Lancashire. Peace.
You cant explode a bomb. The bombs atoms would combust and simply nuke the place of explosion, exploding a bomb is like washing water, it doesnt make sense. however if they wouldve tried to steal the nuclear bomb, that would be more probable instead of literally blowing up a explosive device.
Bit like the late '60's plan to use a nuke to create a natural harbour at Cape Kerauden off the coast of Western Austraila back in the day
oh, nuclear fracking! now that seems like a perfectly good idea! the water will be on fire, AND radioactive!
"I'm sure there is some possible alternate history where this has happened" That's settles it, multiverse theory is legit, it has Tom Scott's say so.
A moor is soft ground soaked with water. The gas would bubble out everywhere. Or if you make a huge hole then you have a huge waterfall. I can't imagine how this is supposed to work?
They found that the gas was radioactively contaminated after it had been stored in a contaminated, highly radioactive environment?? Well what a surprise. Amazing that they needed to explode nuclear bombs to "discover" this. They already knew the effects of radiation and the half lives of radioactive elements. Simply an excuse to play with their toys
It's a wonder we didn't all die in the 60's.
You mean a very "Courageous decision"^^
It's a good job that never happened. Detonating a nuclear bomb in Yorkshire would have caused literally several pounds worth of damage!
Wow!
ok but where does the material go? compresses?  Also why cant they do the same thing with conventional bombs?
Somebody, or more likely someTHING would need to seal the inside of that cavern, or else trying to store methane in there would probably be like storing gasoline in a colander.
damn the views are so close to being the same as the Total Cost of Construction
This video is 4:56 seconds long this is the squid game number *does this mean tom scott is in squid game 2*
…what?
1:59 "which should be sufficient for containment given competent overlying rock".  I like how if it went wrong they could say, "Don't look at us!  Look at the completely incompetent rock!".
so tom, what do you have to say about your video with transphobe jill bearup? I see you have finally deleted the video, but we deserve to know what bigotry that bearup still believes
Please, it's the "North York Moors"...I work for them.  I will be sending the link to several people at work tomorrow!
Hmmm, I was considering digging a fish pond in my garden anyway. So if that nuke hasn´t been used anyway . . . maybe we could come to an arrangement. I would hate to see a fine nuke having to be disposed unused because of its age.
i live in whitby and work on the steam trains between grosmont and pickering, how did i not know this??
TBF, using nukes to create canals and do large trench excavation projects would be a great idea if it wasn't for the radiation.
This didn’t show in my subscribed 😞
I hope Tom left a Glowing Review on the sites travel survey.
"Just nuke it" on a whole new level
The only possible explanation is that the perpetrators were from Lancashire...
there's got to be an alternate history where someone suggested this to Margaret Thatcher and they selected a site in Whales for it.
Never nuked, so far.
I feel like this could have done with the Braniac intro. Would there have been a way to argue fair use on that one?
Don't tell spiff
The PNE treaty only limits yield, it doesn't outright ban the peaceful use of nuclear warheads.  The limits are 150kt per explosion and 1,500kt aggregate.  However we have since signed the comprehensive test ban treaty which bans all nuclear explosions whatever the application.
My alternate history: Little known fact is they actually intended going through with it. Got as far as burying the nuke, then found they'd lost the ignition cable. No money to dig it back up again so they just tidied the place up and pretended it never happened. Nuke's still there to this day.
for some reason while people are talking a lot more about plowshare they never really touch on the fact that it was just a fairly transparent cover for nuclear proliferation, nobody really intended to use nuclear bombs peacefully, even the tests the US did on the matter were conveniently also still testing a nuclear bomb
This is awesome in theory, but kind of a mess in practice...
Why be single when you could be blowing up nuclear bombs in Yorkshire
it may have caused 'pounds' worth of damage to some of the local housing 😅
While it is Valentine’s Day , Tom is here for all of us. ❤️
Funny how the Govt official down South thinks it’s ok to. A) set off a nuke in North Yorkshire  B) let’s Experiment by having a nuclear power station have a melt down like Chernobyl and see what happens to the area around. They are mad.
I’ve lived in the North York Moors for 50 years, and never heard that!  But I’m remembering the local outcry when it was proposed to frack under Flamingoland just down the road, the reaction was so great that the company pulled out... and that was ‘only’ fracking!!
0:15 i hope the surgery went well
There was a project to create a massive cavern over Lincoln way to store gas in underground cavern  often wondered about that. If anyone here’s anything let me know Cheers
Not to be that guy but it's actually North York Moors National Park. Albeit it's a bit confusing because it's North York Moors in North Yorkshire
I live in Pickering, what a pleasant surprise to have it somewhat featured in a Tom Scott video!
I'm just here for all the Lancastrians who will no doubt ask "What do you mean nuking Yorkshire is a bad idea?"
Thanks for video 👏🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻💙
Too bad they didnt go for bradford huddersfield and halifax. Even after a nuke area would be a lot nicer
Seriously... I'll let them have my backyard as test site for free
The U.S. Once had a plan called Operation Chariot which involved building a deepwater port in Alaska with nuclear weapons.
if it works except for the radiation why hasnt this idea restarted but with hydrogen bombs  same power, none of the radiation, not a lot more expensive to make
"A few weeks ago, I was looking through records in the British National Archives for a separate video idea that didn't end up going anywhere" He's hiding something from us, and I'm scared to find out what
accidentally read the title as "My top secret plan to explode a nuclear bomb in Yorkshire"
Well, Chernobyl's forest seems to be doing fine.    Even better once we had to remove all those pesky people.  :p
Ahh, the 1960s, when the answer to everything was "MORE NUKES!!!"
We are big humans recklessly flailing around in the dark hurting all other life that inhabit this precious earth 😭😂
where did they think the dirt would go?
Okay, so underground nuclear explosion creates a giant cavern. Did I miss the bit about where all the excavated stuff ends up?
Obviously they went ahead and nuked Derby instead.
A company could have bought a city leveling nuclear bomb for less than 9 million pounds???
For some reason all I can think about is the animation when the wind blows
Radioactive gas ? Wow eureka 🤦‍♂️
I could see equipment similar to MOABs being used for industrial purposes
can i just ask: what font do they use in the old records, i've been dying to get hold of it, because its so gorgous. Its clearly some georgian variant. written with a type writer
Did an American write the report ?
Well, at least there was some kind of purpose to this insanity. In the '50s there was a plan to test a nuke off Duncansby  Head in Scotland. That wasn't for gas storage - just to test the bomb.
And who can forget these Yorkshire ditties:  On Ilkla Moor Baht 'at   Because the shock wave blew it away,  On Ilkla Moor Baht 'at   -------------------------- Ee by gum Does your belly touch your bum? Do your tits hang low,   And in the dark, do they glow?
and a couple years later we find out: they had the bomb explode there and Tom was actually walking on top of a huge gas tank
You can hear Lancashire audibly sighing after watching this video
Gives me aot vibes for some reasons
Notice how they pick a place far away from London to do there proposed tests
If only the far cleaner thermonuclear fusion explosions were smaller...
They should have bombed slough
Plot twist - they actually did it, that's why Tom can't find anymore records?
At around the same time there was a proposal to blast out a new Panama Canal using nukes. Didn't go ahead. In Australia mining magnate, Lang Hancock, wanted to use nukes to mine iron ore but that idea was quenched.
"nuclear fracking"    good lord... GOOD LORD!!!
as a lancastrian, I would like to argue that dropping a nuke on yorkshire would actually be a very good idea
I love how ‘confidential’ is crossed out. Does that mean it’s declassified, is that all it takes? 😂
Hey I've just came across your channel & after looking through your videos I've definitely sub'd to you, you have a huge range of topics so it'll keep me busy during these cold months ahead, keep up the good work your doing.  X😎🐘
Yorkshire may have escaped, but around the same time, the US DOE did in fact nuke a site in western Colorado, applying the same 'logic' as cited in your report.
OK, I get the entire idea. But why choose national park for a site of the underground gas storage?
Bloody hell Tom, you could have waited until this current government is gone before you mentioned nuclear fracking!
The Beiderbecke Tapes. ITV  1987. springs to mind
How many of your videos start with "A few weeks ago.."? Love your vids Tom! <3
1:01 that looks like earth science diagrams
At 1:40 you say “the radiation end up contaminating the gas”. That is factually inaccurate, radiation is a phenomena that is localized within space and time and can’t “contaminate” chemical substances. What you meant was perhaps “the nuclear explosions contaminated the natural gas with radioactive compounds”, which would be closer to reality. Just to separate those two different aspects of nuclear activity for a clearer conversation on it.
Hmmm….  pumped hydro energy storage?
I thought this was going to involve Threads (1984 film).
this is a certified atomic association moment
TOM SCOTT CAME TO MALTON? DID YOU TRAIN? DID U COME TO MALTON
the what
Probs make a good land mark tho if it happened
Hey here is an idea - nuke a hurricane to stop its progression! - d. trump.
Cool
Wow...
usa !? usa...😉 🐓💥 💨PRRRRROFFFF 💨💨 🤭
They probably would have been able to do it if they were to use semi-nuclear bombs.
During this same people, people (govt, oil people) were thinking of nuking the ALBERTA TARS SANDS!  They just couldn't figure out how to get rid of the radiation quickly and cheaply. Insane.
This would've made a great Citation Needed episode.  RIP citation needed
Pity we can't say the same about Maralinga.
What this makes me wonder is why they didn't try to do similar things with regular bombs? I don't know if making a canal or gas storage space underground with explosions worked but if it did with nuclear, they could have done it with regular bombs putting a lot more explosives of course  and maybe it wouldn't work at the same capacity of a nuclear bomb anyway but I do wonder why they didn't follow up with more experiments with regular ones
THEY'RE ARE CREATING THEY'RE OWN BOOS. NUK, UM ? 🐓💥💨 PRRRRROFFFF 💨💨
Isaac Arthur has also proposed this idea for electricity generation
They probably did it in 'For All Mankind'.
You make the coolest videos.
Lancashire's escalated the war of the roses I see
Very secret
I thought I saw you a few weeks ago! Now I know why. Oops!
2:40 "...and then..." *Rule Britannia plays at very HIGH volume*
Just gone on holiday about 8km away from that so might be cool to go to
But can't they just nuke the hurricanes?
Where would the dirt go in the explosion if it could not go up?
not so top secret now is it?
Eee! Trouble at Nuclear Pit.
Well, Yorkshire is the “third world” of the United Kingdom, isn’t it?
Another incredibly interesting video! Love your work Tom
1:21 the alpha male in shorts, flip flops, and a hard hat. What a legend.
I wonder if the originator of the idea came from Lancashire....
Nuclear fracking is a totally Soviet/American thing to have happen.
There have actually been some good uses of peaceful nuclear explosions. Back in the 60's, a gas well in Uzbekistan had caught fire and been steadily burning for 3 years and was seemingly unstoppable. Soviet physicists decided that the best way to stop the fire was with a deep underground nuclear explosion... and it worked! 20 seconds after detonation, the fire was quenched and this technique would be used a few more times by the Soviets until their collapse!
I have a feeling that Tom didn’t have a very romantic valentines day …
To be honest, as a sheffielder, I think it'd do more good than bad.         You know nuking Yorkshire
I've heard variations on this story and the fracking for years, but mostly Texas and Alberta, I've always thought it was some BS the teller was using to impress me. Thanks for brining it to light. In Alberta we use underground Salt Caverns for LNG storage, as they do in the US.
Its amazing to think how people would of thought it may of been a good idea... Then again, its not too far fetched for fossil fuel companies? xD
I love nuclear history! Thanks
I know it’s a bit dreary up here in the north, but nuking us is taking it a bit far
Funny how these techy psychopaths are still in charge of the UK
Or maybe, just maybe, they *did* do it, built the header station in a cavern 20 metres below ground, didn’t tell anyone and Tom just did the whole PTC from a handful of metres above Strategic Natural Gas Depot Northwest.
Seller: “introducing the new lawnmower to mow down anything like buildings you know houses cities and large forests”
a nuclear explosion is a mood more appropriate to today than many people realize
I've been to Yorkshire. I had just always presumed it was nuked.
If any PM would give this a shot, it'd be Boris Johnson.
I find conspiracy theorists unbearable but this stuff unfortunately validates their insanity with verifiable governmental insanity.
The British actually considered nuking somewhere that wasn't the stolen indigenous land in Australia? A little surprising tbh.
Can you be sure they never did that?
Damn, I recognise that area. Used to be one of my old stomping grounds from the Scouts (I lived further down the coast near Scarborough but had friends up that way and the forests are fascinating for walking/camping)
Disgusting
Plot twist: we're in the "alternate history" where they went through with the plan, but it went so well that no one noticed. Still, with anything nuclear being so controversial, the operation's outcome was hidden. There is now a huge artificial cavern, sitting unused, just waiting to be explored by some intrepid future person who stumbles across it by sheer dumb luck one day.
The report came out mere months after I was born. In the US, so the only nuclear testing I had to worry about as a baby was as the Nevada test site which had switched to underground testing by this time. Also, being born in SF, placed the above ground testing at much longer odds of reaching where I lived thanks to prevailing winds.
It looks terrible there. As if it's been deforested.
They wanted to use a 25kt nuke, but these days we have 7-8kt non-nuclear bombs. Wonder if they have put any thought into trying those. Of course it would be horrible and funny if they did all their calculations, then set it off-and instead of making a closed cavern, it just collapsed everything down making a giant hole in the ground
Am pleased it didnt go ahead. Spent a lot of time in the whitby and pickering area. Am up there soon.
As a yorkie, I saw the title and immediately panicked!
Wow. Nuclear - the answer to everything. Crazy stuff.
Maralinga
Giant sinkhole, anyone?
Yorkshire! Yorkshire! Yorkshire! Yorkshire!
OMG yes, please go through cool declassified files nobody else would bother to look at :D
Peaceful nuclear explosion. Oxymoron
I went to Pickering on holiday about 20 years ago. Not sure why I felt the need to share that.
Bruh, I was just watching a bunch of old The Onion videos when I saw this video in the sidebar, I just assumed this was an onion video when I clicked it.
Great video. It's not often that a video tells something completely "new", i.e. a fact that hasn't been relatively known before.
3 Yorkshire men and a nuclear physicist walk into a bar...
"The Yorkshire Moors were, thankfully, never nuked"...  *Camera cuts off*.  Tom: "Unfortunately".
Mostly peaceful Nuclear Explosions.
man..i don't understand how Tom makes every single video so darn interesting..I love it!!
Should have nuked Lancashire instead!
Live a 47h day at the Dayshiftline. I think it would be cool.
Lets explode this thing - what could go wrong?!
Totally Cray Cray....
Tom Scott's trying to kill us :(
It is rumoured, however, that they did use an above ground 35KT nuke near Scunthorpe and it did £1.5M of improvements to the local buildings.
But why did they have to use Nukes? Weren't "normal" bombs strong enough or too expensive? I mean drop something like the Tsar Bomba down there and the effect would be more than enough for what was planned and you wouldn't have to deal with radiation contaminating the area... at least in my mind.^^
Is is just me or is the camera angle really weird?
I don't wanna sound stupid (I'm only American, I promise) but I had no idea there were parts of the UK that looked like that
"how do we get a massive natural-gas storage in this national park?" *Ellan Ripley with a british accent* "Nuke it from orbit. It's the only way to be sure"
Any plan that includes the words "explode a nuclear bomb in..." that does not also include the word "space" is almost certainly not a good plan. But even if it does include the word space, the plan should probably be seriously reconsidered.
God please bring us more people like Tom scott
It would be more interesting if you would later find a note that they did go through with it and there's a decently sized cavern beneath you.
Given the amount of mutants in scarborough, i'm going to assume it actually happened, but they told no-one.
Roses are red, violets are blue, Dear North York Moors, I ☢️ you
Those damn Lancastrian scientists...🤔😉
I assume this is Boris's levelling plan?
With Tom's videos it's always the same for me... "I wonder what this could be about, it can't be just what the title says right?"   "Oh, it is wtf?!?"  Every damn time
The thumbnail says "not a good plan" are you sure it was not a good plan? What if it was a great idea but humans cannot cope with the thought of artificial radiation existing in a hole in the ground and assess risk  rationally. People and their irrational fears the problem, not nuclear earthmoving plans.
The nuclear excavation explosions worked because they were close enough to the surface to blast the surface rock up and away, but I fail to see how a deep crust explosion would make a stable cavern if there was no where to for the vaporized rock to go.  If the vaporized rock doesn't escape, then the surface has to uplift, and if the surface uplifts to make room for the cavern, wouldn't the roof of the cavern be cracked, and under immense pressure from the 2000' of rock above it, and almost instantly collapse back on itself?!
Perhaps a bit of due diligence into seismic records from that era would be helpful. Just because there's no record on paper...etc.
Thanks for the content, Tom, and happy Valentines Day. But I have a question: Do you use any sort of teleprompter or are you that fluent?
Scott. If you ask everyone's favourite Gary Brannan, Gary Brannan, there's probably more stupid ideas like this hidden in the archives.
This was actually really fasinating. I live about 3 miles from that exact spot in Wheeldale, in a tiny village. To know this is actually really cool. Makes me wonder what would happen if it were to happen today
Tom mentioning Wheeldale just gave me PTSD flashbacks of a GCSE Geography school trip to the Moors to measure the widths of depths of the ravines the streams had dug over the millions of years.  There were a few different streams allocated to the groups, and mine was Wheeldale Gill
I'm gonna do it
Bloody hell, I live in Yorkshire! surprised I have never heard of this.
Hmm there certainly were many underground nuke tests, does anyone know, if they did produce a stable cavern or if they collapsed? And how big they were, more or less? Because it seems to me, that if the cavern was big enough to consider it for storage, it would not be stable enough.
I'm glad that they never went through with it, as that would have been an environmental disaster.
Not me having a heart attack when I read the title of the video
As far as we know they were never nuked. If I were you I'd have waved a geiger counter around just to be sure.
Can Yorkshire still produce a metric ton of tea???
"Is it a good idea to nuke a bit of a national park?"   Now that's a sentence I didn't know that I needed to hear today
I bet theres loads of barmy  plans hidden away somewhere. i would love to read through them and have a good laugh.
No, this was actually because Yorkshire sucks.
Love that our lives are ruled by actual supervillains
You try to make your videos shorter in order to fulfill your own Prophecy that online media will mostly consist of shorts within the next 10 years, dont you?
Did you not dig a bit to see if they tried it anyway?
I honestly wonder if atomic weapons are the true Great Filter preventing the universe from being filled with detectable alien life, not for reasons of war, but because of its use as a bigger better dynamite before it was understood.
Well that's one hell of a Mandela effect.
Could have set it off in the high street the place wouldn’t have looked much different.. 😒
Great video! This was interesting!
Ah yes peaceful nuclear explosions. Simple and what could go wrong?
The reckless abandon you demonstrate as a kid by doing a number two in a friends house for the second time. Or doing the same in another friends house. That’s how the government behaved around this time.
Barnsley would be a great place for a project like this.   It's already like that film, the hills have eyes.   Not even joking.
These videos are great.
/Happy historian noises. See, this is why archives are brilliant, you find stories like that. Also, Tom is brilliant at telling the story once it's found, but really, many kudos on the research work, and I am delighted at the presence of a footnote in the description!
On second thoughts, let's not blow up Yorkshire. Tis a silly idea
"Is Nuclear aided mining a good idea" on the same level of idiocy as vertical folding phones
I don’t think they should give up on this idea they should try it on Bradford and see what happens
For some reason I find the idea of nuking Yorkshire funny. I probably shouldn't. I like Yorkshire. BUT someone writing out a detailed plan to nuke Yorkshire had me giggling all through this video.
YORKSHIRE! YORKSHIRE! YORKSHIRE! YORK- oh.
Humans went a bit mental when we unlocked the power of nuclear didn't we.
I love the UK. Thanks to warhammer 40k
So nobody is going to mention the dude casually wearing flip-flops at 1:21
Wait but where does the material go? The explosion might disintegrate the rock, but it wouldn't delete it out of existence. If the space came from pushing the ground apart, there'd surely be much more than just a minor earthquake. If not, surely there'd just be a lot of fragments and shards that might even melt back together from the heat of the bomb. I don't understand how it could create a cavern unless the material is allowed to be ejected out to somewhere.
“Nuke a bit of a National Park.” Something you never want to see on a government proposal.
This was my favorite vid of yours in awhile. Thanks for sharing Tom!
UNclassified?
Nobody else could turn "Nothing came of it" into such an interesting story
Are those clusters of trees part of a recent reforestation effort by any chance? They look newly planted.
Somehow I think that such a cavern would have probably collapsed. Then they would just have had a huge sinkhole in the ground.
Now search the seismic records in England, Ireland, and Scotland to triangulate where they actually did it. ☢️☢️☢️  This is why we need a better system than a global corporate oligarchy making money together in back rooms.
Good that they didn't blow up Yorkshire, crying shame they still blew up the people of central Australia.  :(
My god, you are borderline hysterical.  SMH
Listen Tom, we can't just let bad political, environmental, and financial decisions stop us from nuking bits of national parks; we just can't!
If they'd detonated it under Yorkshire it would have caused millions of pounds worth of improvements.
I didn't think a place in Britain could remind me so much of my own backyard in Southeast Finland
Finally
Picking Yorkshire is ludicrous, absurd, it should definitely have been Scotland. Would certainly have made the SNP more interesting
Why did human what to nuke everything back then lmao. got a problem? nuke your way out of it.
Extra points for it being a Yorkshire fact
This has very high "Have you tried... kill all the poor?" energy.
The natural landscape is evil & must be obliterated!
Ok, this may be a stupid question, but I don't understand how that would create a cavern? Like, I get how it would cause a huge shockwave underground, but isn't there still the same amount of rock still down there?
Not sure I feel comfortable with the people in charge of gasometers being all "Gas Council want big boom!"
Did you know the UK actually nuked the US? They were allowed to fly a bomber to the Nevada test site to test a weapon. Would make an interesting video.
labour or cons constituency!
Happy Valentine’s Day!
There was actually a proposal to drill next to the Deepwater Horizon and lower a nuke into it seal the well shut. The Soviets did this a couple of times. Honestly, if DH was going to still be leaking a month later, it would have been the right thing to do.
Has anyone asked Ronnie Pickering about this Pickering related news?
I was expecting environmentally unfriendly nuclear testing, I got environmentally unfriendly nuclear gas tanks. I'm not disappointed.
For gods sake, don’t let blojob Johnson see that report!
1:39 Huh, didn't know radiation could contaminate gases.
LUDDITE!  I think this sensible project should be reactivated to make vast, underground storage caverns to store bitcoins and Prince Andy's Teddy Bears.
British Gas, from boilers to bombs
Where would the ground go? When you want to store gas down there in a cavern, where would the former ground go to? Vaporise? Compressed? I can’t imagine anything?
gets sniped
I love Wheeldale, never knew about this. I know about the possibility of unexploded ordnance around there.
People will really bomb anything, won't they?
Could you imagine the NIMBY protests
What a great idea!
I agree with your jaw drop analysis of this. I mean what were they thinking?
Now about the nukes the Brits set off in outback Australia, without evaculating the indigenous population....
This is insane, loved the video.  Not the idea,  I glad they didn't pull it through but it's still fascinating how different their mindset was
Conventional explosives had existed for thousands of years, why did it have to be a nuke?
This makes me think about all the projects that did happen or are about to happen, but we don't know about them because they are still classified...
In this video: Something that most likely happened in the Fallout universe to disastrous consequences
"...as far as we know, anyway"
You could limit the fallout to some extent by putting a lead layer in the core of the bomb (that is what they did with the Tzar bomb), but the nearby rocks would still become ratioactive because of the ionizing radiation emitted...
Imagine going through with the plan and trying to keep it secret. "Remember that earthquake a few months ago? Turns out that was nothing to be concerned about. On an unrelated note, we found a massive cavern under the national park that we will use as a gas storage facility once the random radioactive radiation inside of it subsides."
😲
Thank goodness we don't have leaders who have ideas like nuking hurricanes
‘mostly peaceful nuclear explosions’ …in ‘today-speak’.
There have been lots of projects that look daft now but were pursued at the time as viable. We still chase a few. Follow the money.
I'm more worried about how cheap nukes are to make... 9 million dollars for that entire project including the nuke... in my mind a nuke on its own would cost 9 million dollars on the low end, but nope, apparently they're much cheaper to produce than I thought. That's a bit worrying.
Hello Mr.Views counter 🙂
0;55 This is hilarious
I never imagined anything so comical would pop up on youtube today! I'm visualizing if it happened here in Portugal, maybe they'd test a bomb somewhere in Alentejo, maybe 100 or 200 kms north of Algarve 🤣 kaboooom 😂
Wow, I was 100% sure you were walking around Heiðmörk, just outside of my homecity, Reykjvík, Iceland. So similar!
Yorkshire is full of Northerners, would nuking it really be that bad?
The North Yorkshire moors were, thankfully, never nuked... As of this recording.
This... explains Doncaster.
Happy non nuclear Valentine's day XD
Won’t lie…my thoughts went to the fallout video game series and think if they made one focused on the UK this would be a cool historical add in.
Detonating a nuclear device in Yorkshire...this could have resulted in millions of pounds worth of improvements...Lancashire lad...👍👍👍
4:15 "Things would've need to have been very different" Very different? I think the handling of the Windscale nuclear accident shows otherwise  UK politicians were well accustomed to playing fast and loose with the citizens health in relation to radiation.
i mean, even when we ignore the point of detonating an nuclear explosion for excavating: Can we just leave a national park alone and not use it for mining Operations of any kind? Only capitalistic Idiots want to do that and tell the people it's for them, not the pockets of shareholders
I suppose they're now going to make a movie about this in the not too distant future. What should they call it?      Don't Look Down ?
Could we use hydrogen bombs for this? Nuclear fusion doesn't generate radiation, right?
In the Fallout universe, the experiment was successfully carried out and repeated multiple times over the decades. The entire national park had been converted into Yorkshire National Gas Storage Park, known only as Gashire to the ghouls inheriting the area after the War.
Back in my day we would dig a big hole, drop a nuke in it and then cook with the gas. But we were happy then...
You're right tom, London should be nuked.
Saw the title and all I could think was "Please be Leeds! Please be Leeds! Please be Leeds! Please be Leeds! Please be Leeds! Please be Leeds! Please be Leeds! Please be Leeds! Please be Leeds! Please be Leeds!"  Never been more disappointed in a Tom Scott video.
West Yorkshire however, would probably benefit from being nuked.
The alternate history in which a nuclear device was actually detonated would’ve seen this video made by plainly difficult instead
Wasn’t even in Rotherham ffs
The fact nukes were going for £164,000 a piece in 1969 is making me revaluate a few things
There was a somewhat similar plan to nuke a canal from the coast of egypt s couple kilometers inland and create a sea in a natural depression in the landscape, which - so was the theory iirc - would result in an oasis forming. They never went through with it
aTOMic bomb 😳😳
How come Britain was not thinking about blowing up an atoll somewhere in the Pacific I am sure even with all the land lost in WW2 you must have had some little islands somewhere.
I am become storage, container of gasses
Lmao
As Tom said, but this cannot be underlined enough: Operation PLOWSHARE wasn't just a theoretical proposal, the mountainous regions of the southwest United States had multiple nuclear detonations.
Misread "The" in the title as "My". A similar, but very different sentiment-
I am concerned about the pudding
"Okay, let's nuke Yorkshire."  "How are we planning on getting the natural gas there once the storage is ready?" "Who said anything about natural gas?"
Me in Yorkshire: ‘…well ain’t that something’
3:54 "Now as far as I can tell..." says Tom stood atop a giant undergroud gas storage reservoir...
Morrissey wanted to nuke a northern seaside town in his song ‘Everyday is like Sunday’
My question is, where the heck does the rock go to create the cavity if the explosion is entirely contained?
so the idea of officials destroying the country from the inside is not new...🤔
Wow! Talk about a bombshell!
What was the projected cost for the nuke?
Let me guess, everyone on that committee came from Lancashire?
Thanks Tom
I'm sure a Heartbeat episode with that alternate history in it would have been fascinating!
I guess they couldn't get planning permission from the council.  jk.
just imagine what other crazy scheme's the so called "government" have proposed and carried out without the population knowing about them,
Gas storage is a perfectly balanced activity with no exploits.
Me sitting in my flat in Leeds 👀😅
It's videos like this that are amazing. I never knew about this but now i do.
😂 ngl my valentines date was kinda shite, Tom will you accept this rose instead? 🌹
I think this Anthony Horowitz talks about it in his book, Ravens Gate.
Probably every rural part of UK was tasked to make a report like this. Just ended up in several archives.
"Nuclear-fracking" is definitely not a term I expected to hear.
I wonder why didn't the americans immediately publish their findings, so that nobody else wastes time and nukes testing
Never fails to enlighten and entertain this guy.  Newsletter is good too!
Fantastic video.   I’ve been there and never knew.
one thing I'm wondering is where all the rock would've gone... evaporated? pushed out of the way? It has to go somewhere...
Noted that Tom didn't just do Pickering High Street but also an innocuous shot of Castlegate...  Another video coming up about Norman fortifications? Siege castles?
I'm just sorry this document was never discussed in an episode of The Thick of It.
Bonkers to think that would of been so close to where I live
Whoop!  [See Tom Scott video on day of release talking about Yorkshire.  Wonder if it is round here.  Sees it is actually North Yorkshire...  Sees it is filmed down my road!]  Quite glad they didn't bomb it actually as I suspect £5000 a few years back still wouldn't quite compensate Pickering Beck glowing in the dark.
God I wish they'd nuke it all.
As someone born and raised in that area in the 90's I'm rather glad they didn't introduce a significant quantity of radiation into the ecosystem. I quite like having all my teeth. And organs.
Bunch of bastards, em..
I remember this episode of Heartbeat
0:11  Unclassified or Declassified Tom? 👀
North Korea:  "Pfft..... Amateurs."
Another marvelously researched factoid! Thank you for your service! Also good luck with Beardyman!
good story...
me being from north yorkshire, the title worried me 😂
Perhaps we should come up with a list of places in Yorkshire that we do want to get nuked?
Now that's a closing sentence if I ever heard one.
I suspect there's a few plans to place a Nuke on the PM's desk these days!!  (am i on a list? Good)
i just see yorkshire in the title and get flashbacks to the tech dif crew yelling ‘YORKSHIRE YORKSHIRE YORKSHIRE’
The forest of this national park does not look healthy :/
See ? 👀
That was surely a feasibility study and not a plan. I wish the two were not so conflated in the public mind by journalists, but I guess "study" doesn't have the same selling impact as "plan".
Typical that the British Government wanted to test nuclear explosions in the North of England. Some things never change.
It could only improve Bradford
Pros: big craters and underground storage without digging.  Cons: radiation that will contaminate the area for thousands of years.  Seems worth it. I'm surprised the big corporations didn't manage to make this happen.
Cant blame the people that researched it though. They were trying to use one of the most powerful technologies ever developed to do something other than blowing up cities, and actually properly evaluated their ideas before going through with them.
I mean its not too late to still nuke them
My only take away from this is a nuke costs less than 9 million dollars
The excellent 1985 BBC TV series "Edge of Darkness" (set in Yorkshire!) explores what might happen if the project goes wrong . . . .
And they say fracking is a bad idea 🤔🤔🤔
They were going to do this to skipsea too in the 50s. Somebody really hated Yorkshire at that time
nice colours
Not the only time the British Gov thought about nuking a part of Great Britain. In 1953, when the nuclear programme was still being developed, they thought about testing them in the north of Scotland. Reason they didn't? "Too wet". (Specifically, rain may have interfered with triggers and cloud cover could have reflected the shock waves back onto settled areas).  So they moved to Australia and nuked some bits of there instead - showing even less concern for local inhabitants than they did for people in Scotland.
@0:20 - "or to stimulate natural gas production"? So, fracking, but many, many, many times worse. Oh, joy.
And with that bombshell, it is time to end :D
I thought that’s what France was for.  (You’re welcome, Lindeybeige.)
🦕
What if we do live in the reality that they actually did it, the plan was so successful that its current state is still classified and the local residents still have no idea that it happened?
The French wanted to detonate a nuke below Paris
I bet the people camping would not be happy
very top secret
A good opportunity to rid Britain of Middlesborough.
When taking a gamble on time spent reading potentially mundane material pays off
Gorgeous area of the country, shame about the people.
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO GET YORKSHIRE PUDDINGS WITH NUKES?!!!
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb
Tom Scott's definitely on a few watchlists.
Does Yorkshire even exist
Gives a whole new meaning to The Fall's 'Hit The North'. Wonder what historian and National Archive addict Peter Hennessy makes of this? With his extensive coverage of Cold War UK defence policy, nuclear planning?
I daresay I wouldn't have noticed, apart from the vast improvement in temperature
However, in the Fallout universe, most of The North was redeveloped using peaceful use of nuclear explosions.
Maybe a good idea if a hydrogen bomb is used? Like Tsar bomba, which's explosion was mostly thanks to fusion reaction, not fission.
One usually expects someone to blow up a nuke in Sheffield or Hull, not in Northern Yorkshire.
The things you can discover by accident when conducting research at the National Archives!! (Mine was stumbling across a document signed by Admiral Lord Nelson!)
A yes, I see the logic: Dynamite creates explosions and is great for mining. Nukes also create explosions, so they must be great for mining too. Right?
For some defense of the idea, at the time it was thought that nukes would continue to become cleaner with better engineering. This was the same logic behind the Orion drive. Not, very realistic, but not completely insane as we now know it to be.
If Youtube had been around in the 1960s, I'm sure there would be a channel called "Is it a good idea to nuke this?"
Don't wanna say this on this auspicious occasion of Valentine's Eve , but I have to , the greed of very few white people of the past ruined the whole planet and now it continues to degrade for the spreading greed of all of us . It's makes me sad , whenever I think about it .
The northern Yorkshire moors haven’t been nuked… yet.
Its hard to believe this was even considered given what we know today
Nuclear fracking? Yes please, fill my V16 muscle car with some leaded, radiated gasoline as I light my asbestos cigar
What is that giant manholecover with the gaspipes running into, on the left side in the final drone shot?
wallace and gromit: a matter of loaf and death
Rather than Glorious Yorkshire they should have done it over the border. Manchester comes to mind and they don't even need to dig a hole :p
i'm happy they did the research and decided not to use the nuke...much better than using the nuke and not doing the research!
Tom one of my favourite content creators can't lie, I get more excited from his uploads than any other creator
"Tonight, on the Grand Tour"
welp there goes the tea
I'm glad humans still don't adapt thermonuclear fusion. God knows what shenanigans they would invent with it.
Er what you've done there is you've built a giant radioactive sinkhole full of radioactive flammable gas.
Nukanal?
Typical British government. Lets nuke our own country, but do it up north away from us that "matter".
Today except parliament?
... were thankfully never nuked... As far as we know
My theory: whoever wrote that report was definitely from Lancashire 😛
Very awesome and entertaining 🌈
Psychopaths.
Petition to bring back the basics
“Boom” -Tom Scott, 2022, very sonorously
Peaceful use of nuclear weapons, including infrastructure projects, still has potential.   Where there is no breathable atmosphere or ecosystem. Lots of real estate in the solar system for us to develop.
wen tech diff live tour?
In Canada, we had the plan to set off Nuclear Bombs under the oil sands,  the heat would melt the bitumen which could then be pumped out.  The plan was abandoned cause it wasn't financially viable
Somebody should go poking around with a geiger counter just to make sure they didn't actually do it; somebody might have decided to run a pretest.
1. This plan would have made for a great Yes, Minister episode.  2. Imagine the explosion going ahead, but something goes a bit wrong, and it all collapses down into a large crater. The famed Atomic lake at the heart of a Yorkshire nature preserve!
“i don’t know, gotta nuke something” - nelson muntz
I ador yorkshire, and pickering is amazing! Please tell me you rode the steam trains while you were there!
Or were they?
probably regretting not doing it now
You could explode a surface nuke in Walthamstow, London E17 and nobody would notice the difference.
That were a greet episode of Last of the summer wine...  Nora Battys thermonuclear knickers
North Yorkshire is actually barren waste...
Great video. It's a shame nothing came of PNE because there are so many possible applications. I recall Freeman Dyson's son claimed that (for Project Orion) they developed a much less radioactive form of nuke which would have made it more practical - but because it required less fissile material, it ended up being classified forever as they were worried about the design falling into terrorist hands. Not sure how much truth there is to that, but it's a nice idea.
And then, errm,...brrrb
hmmm not enjoying the new thumbnail design, this is one notch away from r/uselessredcircle territory
That was the time menwith hill and flyingdales was built so makes sense
Bloody southeners!
People who go to york university  🍿
I wonder how much the nuke itself would cost.
Epic Bro
So THAT'S how SpiffingBrit was going to dig the canal to Harrowgut... ;)
America: tests nukes in the Nevada desert  Soviet Union: tests nukes in Siberia and deserts of Central Asia   UK: what if we set off a nuke in Yorkshire?
Looks like it was about 54.3887284185823, -0.8155893622870234 if anyone wants to look at it on Google Maps
Speaking as someone who's half-Lancastrian, the idea of nuking Yorkshire has a fair bit to recommend it.
It's astounding how many international treaties only forbid stuff because the people at the time thought it would be impossible (or way too expensive). Like mining on the moon or under the arctic ice.
As a Lancastrian, I think the plan to nuke Yorkshire was an excellent idea
There goes the rhubarb
London-based civil servants one day in the 60s: "Let's nuke Yorkshire!"
I live in Kiruna, Sweden, where underground explosions occur every night at 1:20am, and a lot of the buildings here have been developing cracks, and even the ground itself is cracking (to the point that they're moving the city 3km west). Now, the explosions here are much closer to the buildings and much smaller than the proposed Yorkshire nuke, but I can guarantee there would've been more than "a few small cracks"!
Great video Tom, as a Yorkshireman I found this fascinating. Nuclear bomb vs group of Yorkshiremen the odds are good. (For the Yorkshiremen)
If this landed on our current government's desk they would have done it without hesitation
Brits have to live in the 20th century to feel relevant!
As a history undergrad I am extremely envious of Tom being able to casually stroll up to the British National Archives and sieve through the documents I can only wish of accessing (due to costs and covid)
“Top secret” “nuclear” and “explosion” is quite the oxymoron
I mean, what could possibly go wrong, right? Right?
I love all these 'peaceful use of nuclear weapons' projects. I love how people thought 'nuke it' was a valid solution to many of life's problems. And then figured out that it wasn't practical. At all. Maybe it would be valid on the moon, though, or on Mars. Just nuke a hole and build a habitat in it. Radiation needs time to go away? That's fine, it's on an entirely different world.
FYI Nuclear is HYDROGEN  Nuclear is ONLY a fear psy-op
This is the most stereotypically "Tom Scott" title I've ever seen.
So, the nulear fracking gas is contaminated, you say Why not just burn it on-site, and convert it into electric power. Eyy?
I like the idea, let's do it.
They should do it in London
ermmm if there wasn't a conclusion.  what if they actually did set one off? is it possible to measure the area? what if the reason it's still redacted is because somewhere deep underground lies the leaking radioactive gas?
😮...🤔...😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
I see you guys in the UK also like to deforest national parks regularly... Fekin' hell...
Read the title and expected this to be another randomly generated video. Imagine my delight
"Nuke the whales?"  "Gotta nuke something."
Maybe they didn't nuke the North Yorkshire moors, but they did put PGM-17 Thor intermediate range ballistic missiles in the middle of the Lincolnshire wolds and in a refuelling accident nearly nuked a thousand square miles of the most productive agricultural land in the country.
The north yorkshire moors were never nuked YET
Nuclear and Fracking, now there's two words I would have never imagined being put together.
No my house!
But I guess they still round up the dwarfs.
Wasn't that the plot of "Dalek Invasion of Earth 2150AD"?
I'm just imagining Kenny Everett with giant comedy hands shouting: "Let's bomb Yorkshire!"
£164,000 for a nuclear device?  <reaches for piggy bank and hammer>

Fallout New Yorkshire
Ahh yes,  the ole' clear cutting of tree in a National Park...
Declassified...
How do you know they didn't do it? Better get a Geiger counter out there ASAP!
I didn't know we could read old secret documents. How do i find them in Australia.
what!
Well it's not very secret is it now?
Hol' up, why they tryna bomb me!
Interesting
"... conveniently right _after_ the US and USSR had found out it was a bad idea". On the one hand, yes, of course. They found out it was a bad idea, so it made sense to ban it, lest others make the same mistake. On the other hand... I love that kind of humour.
Now that's some worms level physics. Make an underground explosion, and have all the rock vanish in a spherical space :P
I thought they'd done it.
one of those things that seem good on paper
Ah, the time when overexcited scientists just wanted to nuke some more
Was there ever a nuclear explosion on British soil? Did we do any kind of tests "locally"?
EY UP! Bomb in t'moors.
The sheer stupidity of the idea is breathtaking.
Still not nearly as daft as shutting down the economy for two years for no reason whatsoever.
Should of done it in Slough or Milton Keynes instead
The people who came up with this idea. Did they have Lancastrian accents did they.
It's too bad that this didn't have more interest.  Maybe it would have been more palatable if they chose, instead of a national park, say some place like Manchester
This video feels like WE are in the alternate universe of the universe where Tom Scott makes a video saying "I wish I could make this video on an untouched land, talking about what might have been".
3,000,000,000 years ago, the Martians had a similar idea.  Things did not go well  ;D
I suspect it's a matter of having spent so much money developing the technology, they were desperate for non-military applications. It's just that fission and fusion bombs are so dirty you can't really use them for anything but warfare.
Imagine researching a mediocre idea / something not original enough / something otherwise not making good video material, and coming across THAT.
It’s Valentine’s Day and Tom makes a video about atoms breaking up.
Now, are we _sure_ it wouldn't be a good idea to nuke Yorkshire? ;)
The soviets did use one to put out an oil well fire.
It's great having the town I live in in a Tom Scott video!
How do you have a cavern 6Km below ground without removing any of the rubble?
Ah yes peaceful nuking
Nr Whitby... just what we need, radioactive vampires!!!
During the Cold War. It really seems like every single General had a fetish for nukes. I mean, how many times do you really need to "test" nuclear weapons?
4:04 Captions say "I suspect it would _not_ have been a very bad political decision", but you say "... it would have been a...".
Tony Stark: Not a great plan.
"Listen, I have a great idea..."
If it's in Scarborough it counts as gentrification.
What if they actually did it but that part of the record is still classified
Speaking as a Lancastrian the best place for a nuclear bomb would be Yorkshire.
fun fact the soviets used a nuke to put a natural gas fire out
Sorry for being a bit anal, but it’s the North York Moors, not the North Yorkshire Moors
love this camera, feels better for some reason. keep up the great work tom, love the videos.
Watching this at a school. The FBI is on high alert.
I fail to see the problem with this plan. I say we go ahead with it! As an American I will watch with great interest from the other side of the ocean and then pretend I wasn't an active participant when things go sideways, as is tradition.
thats scary i live 5 miles away from pickering
should have done huddersfield.
Wasn’t tsar bomba a clean nuclear explosion?
In 1969 (Giggity 😏) PM was Harold Wilson. I wonder what nuking North Yorkshire would have done to Labour 🤔 Maybe it would have hit the desk of Edward Heath in '70. I can see the headlines "Tories nuke Yorkshire" 🤣
sometimes you are just in awe at the ideas floating inside the heads of some people at positions of power
Watch your back tom. If you keep going futher you'll get stabbed in the back, or shot in the head. Or maybe, and just maybe, you'll be stabbed in the back and shot in the head.
Welp - I'm from Pickering. News to me and glad I'm not irradiated.
look up bbc threads
Trouble at t'mill
4:40 or is it? 👁
Practically my back yard!!!
If you go back in 30 years you might just find the full Sue Gray report...and possibly Cressida Dick's ''how I oversaw the murder of an innocent Brazilian'' report too.
As someone who helped establish the antifracking site at Kirby Misterton, a 5 minutes cycle from pickering where we used the shops, this doesn't surprise me, the government especially tories have wanted to ruin Yorkshire for years but they won't succeed as the locals are passionate about their county.
Another example why this is the best  page on YouTube.
Hey that's not far from where I live
"My heart burns for you, like the radioactive flames would upon my gas stovetop"  Valentines with Tom Scott
Brilliant video, Who would have ever known..? Thanks Tom
This idea is actually quite good in my opinion,myabe use nitroglycerin or high explosive thing instead of nukes...i mean if it work well then it's quite good,reducing the price (probably although i doubt it'll be cheaper than digging with machinery stuff) and time to dig such things,maybe with lower explosive power we can use it to create a hile for new skyscraper foundation and basement area or underground transportation maybe instead of digging it for 6-10 years we can utilize controlled explosion to speedup the process....maybe this idea could works in the future...maybe
Another example of an obviously bad idea that we found out was bad the hard way. At least this place was spared from testing.
Unfortunately Yorkshire still remained intact.        I'm joking! I love tea 😳😅
Why do all those trees in that national park look suspiciously like a tree farm, in the way they are planted in rows?
Did you bring the Geiger counter though >_>
I’m a bit nervous realizing that governments still thinking about different horrible things that will be declassified only decades later.
Should've detonated it at Birmingham.
Great video! I had no idea - I'd be super interested in more stories from declassified documents!
why do you use imperial on your videos?   ik its just dividing by 6.6 but still why bother?
It was more like, "In the 1960s, America was running "Operation Plowshare": the idea that perhaps they could convince the public that nuclear bombs could be used for peace, not war." :/
Nice
damn.. the 60s and 70s, insulate everything with asbestos, spraying dangerous pesticides onto our growing food, almost wiping out all life in rivers and planning to dig canals with nukes. And I thought it was mostly all about weed 😂
And no doubt, were the documents not public, it would be classified as conspiracy theory by today's "fact checkers". Because, remember kids, the government always knows best what is good for you.
secret plan to explode a nuclear bomb in yorkshire ....... this was thought up by someone in London wasn't it
*Reads title* How did I miss that Wallace and Gromit film?
It is a shame that we are so unable to control radioactivity at all. It has so many advantages; it is cheap, clean, sustainable - and deadly.
4k!!
its stories like this that make Fallout's depictions of society fueled at the domestics level by nuclear power a biiiiiiit more realistic
LET'S GO
As someone who lives in North Yorkshire can confirm
"We accidently destroyed Pickering, causing more than £20 worth of damage"
Why Yorkshire?  Did Australia say no thanks to nuclear testing this time around?
Yorkshire! Yorkshire! Yorkshi-- (BOOM)
It's not top secret anymore
Petition to unironically nuke Yorkshire in 2022
40 mins from my front door.......😐 vaguely worrying
Now this is a good video
Absolutely mad.
It's a bit too far north of Bradford, should have got the green light then.
Leeds is agood place for nuclear tests
I love these small videos! I know that thers a lot of work and dedication going into them!<3
Let's do it
I wonder if it was a good plan 🤔
Nuking the UK? I’m listening.
Tom Scott is the most entertaining person ever.
"nuclear fracking" oh my god
“Reading old classified documents and having one’s jaw drop” is literally the entire appeal of SCP.  I wonder when Tom will pay Site-19 a visit...
1969 nice
the Spiffing Brit would be absolutely devastated if Yorkshire actually got nuked
If I have learned anything about the 50s and 60s, it's to no longer be surprised when I learn about someone planning to blow something completely bizarre up with a nuclear bomb.
"Nuclear Fracking" what an evil sounding combination of words
Never nuked...  that you know of.
Not much of a secret now is it
9million pounds to set off a nuke? Oufff
Or maybe they did do it and nobody knows
Now, I'm not a nuclear scientist, but I have some questions when it comes to this. So, they were going to plug the top, so nothing leaked out. And then set off the bomb, There would be no real disturbance on the surface, and it would create a cave. Really? So, all that rock down there, where would that GO, exactly?  If the rock was evaporated, that would create a HUGE amount of gas, which would seriously try to be vented out somewhere. But you said nothing would leak out. So what exactly WOULD happen?
If you ARE going to set off a nuke in central England, doing it in a national park is ideal. Nobody will complain about THAT...
'Yorkshire road improvement plan'
As someone from Yorkshire I think I can speak for most of us when I say we don't want people to set off nuclear bombs here
Perhaps out there somewhere in the UK they actually succeeded with a nuclear excavation. Then found it was unfeasible to use the resulting cavity. We need Scully and Mulder to work with Tom to sort this all out. Thanks for the video.
Woah, woah, woah. Let’s not write this off so quickly. I think we should have a referendum on this. It worked fine for Brexit. Should we nuke Yorkshire? Should Yorkshire remain or leave?
"They figured out the radiation contaminates the gas." Did that really need a physical test to figure out?
Look into the German nuclear program.  It's been poorly covered up for decades.  Still some suspiciously radioactive spots in Germany where they tested and held them( granted most of the spots are now restricted military training grounds)
What about a other location,…. Middle London, under Downing Street 10 …. If it was such low risk…. 😂
Do wish we had the total paper trail of what stopped this in the end, would be interesting to see their conclusions.
This is now my favorite Tom Scott video.
Nice quiet little place... perfect for crazy research and experimenting.
Fun fact. It was the Soviets who found what is so far the only practical peaceful use of nuclear bombs. They used a nuclear bomb to seal a gas well that had blown out and all other methods of trying to stop it had failed.
Wouldn't the explosion just create a vacuum that would immediately collapse with rubble and be way harder to excavate?
Or is there a hollow cavern 600 meters beneath the earth's surface 🤔🤔
Tom Scott and the national park that was never nuked
There's an alternative universe where Tom Scott is there filming a video with the title "The Yorkshire Nuclear underground gas storage facility"
This certainly gives me to the term, _"Yorkshire pudding."_  😊😊😊
As someone who is very unfamiliar with bombs, aren’t there bombs today that have a similar effective blast power to that of a nuclear bomb’s, but without the radiation? If such bombs exist, I’m curious why they wouldn’t just proceed with those plans anyway in a non-nuclear fashion?
Testing nuclear weapons on Earth was stupid, period!  I remember the Americans accidentally causing fallout to fall over Las Vegas.
Nuclear weapons do not exist, Japan was firebombed as most of it's buildings were made from wood, The nuclear thing is fear porn like climate change and asteroids also a con. Research the info is out there but not with the MSM which is run by the intelligence services to keep everybody in the dark as this suits the parasitic billionaires.
Well it's not top secret anymore.
That's why there's no foliage...
bruh
TIL parts of England have similar town names to southern Ontario, Canada
In God's own country? How dare they!
I suspect whom ever came up with the idea for the report didn't like Yorkshire
Wa Da Fook is "Peaceful Nuclear Explosion"? You mean Chernobyl or Fukushima?
for the algo 🚀🚀🚀
Quick reminder that the soviet union once used a nuke to put out a fire. It was a gas leak fire that raged 1,074  until they used the nukes blast to put it out. Of course this was an absolute last resort, but still: They used the ultimate,  hottest fire from a nuke to put out a fire.
Ask the people of Las Vegas … they know where the Sedan crater is and how far away it is.  👍👍👍👍
Could be a Quatermass story
This programme was further developed to create potholes in roads.
Wow, crazy. ☢️
shoulda done it
Can we all take a moment to imagine Gary Brannan riding the bomb down the borehole, Slim Pickens style, waving a flat cap in the air
the us tested this idea and turns out it's a lot harder to remove the radiation after and also that it takes a very long time.
did you bring a Geiger counter to check?
Rocks would melt to form a giant radioactive elephant's foot underground.
"secret"
If you can’t find the follow up note, my money is on the actually having done it somewhere and they aren’t ready to tell you all yet.
The Burro Schmidt Tunnel was made with dynamite, it was quite large. I don't understand why they planned a nuclear explosion instead of just good ol dynamite. Maybe price per pound was cheaper for nuclear?
Stories like this always bring the last line of Monthy Python's Galaxy Song to mind....
They uncovered my plan
Very interesting find
"The secret plan to explode a nuclear bomb in Yorkshire..."     "It was not a good plan." I laughed harder than I had any right to.
As the prime minster at the time was Harold Wilson, a Yorkshireman representing a Yorkshire constituency maybe the whole thing was a troll by the characters concerned. Can't see it passing muster if it ever rose to the attention of the cabinet of the day.  Now if the site was above ground and in Surrey, they might have been tempted (rictus grin).
9 million pounds for a nuke? Cheap at the price.
YOU WERE IN NORTH YORKSHIRE AND I WAS SO CLOSE TO YOU! Come by the Rotunda Museum in Scarborough, if you get a chance!
Woah
I heard they dropped an atomic bomb on Swindon. About 15 quids worth of damage.
I love the enthusiasm that people had in the 50s to 70s about using Nuclear Bombs
I'm trying to think of a single use for an explosion that big. Like I get you can have fairly small nuclear explosions, but any of those seems like you'd save a little on material costs and a -lot- on cleanup if you just used TNT. Maybe if we need to build a ship harbor on the moon, since the radiation will all be gone by the time we get the water there. Or maybe we'll figure out a 'clean nuke' one day and can then redress the idea.
More like Bomb Scott
Tom - you walked past my house! 2:50
Would have buggered up the Ballistic Missile Warning System Radar site at Fylingdales, which is just the other side if Newtondale.
I didn’t see an item on that budget list that said “nuclear bomb”.

I just thought this was gonna be how some people from Lancashire wanted to one-up their rival county by... blowing up their rival county.
I grew up in Whitby and I've always said it's one of the most isolated towns in England, so I totally understand why someone thought it would be a good idea to nuke the local countryside.
What a missed opportunity. I lived in Yorkshire for 20 years - I might have been spared that horror if a bomb had finished it off before I found a job there.
No more Yorkshire, lads! Let’s gooooooooo
... yet.
What happens to the material that used to be in the underground area that's now a cavern? Surely it doesn't just disappear.
Spoiler in the thumbnail!
I always love a good nuke story.
Chilling to consider these sorts of events were considered. Or is it? Creatives exist along the entire spectrum of science and human psychology. Stay curious and alert.
Valentine's booms.
The nuclear era was absolutely bonkers.
greycourt school has a tunell what goes to ham house then ham house has one what goes to marble hill house etc its a mad area also most of the twickenham propertys have tunells and every house on ham common has air raid shelters. we have cut throat alley in ham richmond with etchins going back many yrs
Hey tom, don't spin the camera like you did at 0:32, makes me feel sick :D
UK nuclear testing in the 1950s - let's do it as far away as possible in the most remote parts of Australia. UK nuclear testing in 1969 - let's do it in Yorkshire.
It was a good idea, Birmingham tho.
So is it right to say "put t'ermonuclear bomb down t'pit", or is that a different region of the country?
Shame it fell through
I wonder what the world would look like today if nuclear bombs didn't create radiation.  ...probably very different.
Is it a big kaboom? No, its a nasty big kaboom.
ah i live in richmond i hope to see some videos soon from kew or richmond im suprised u have not done knowing the history
I've ridden the heritage line between Pickering and Whitby before! Absolutely stunning country, what a shame it would have been if this plan went through
dont think anyone would mind
Good.
I bet that would have cost a bomb
It's crazy to think how many documents have been declassified and yet so many people still don't know about stuff like this!!
Were these plans made in Lancashire, by any chance?
Not Yorkshire 🥺
The town of Pickering? Is that where Ronnie Pickering is from?
Yet.
I feel like London would be a better place for a test these days.
Amazingly interesting video as always Tom!
I mean a few well placed nukes could fix anything
Of course, there's some parts of Yorkshire more susceptible to nuke explosions (Fylingdales, Menwith Hill) if they ever start flying for real. I now live in the immediate vicinity of Faslane and Coulport in Scotland, so I'd not expect to come off well in such a scenario...
Im sure a lot of Lancastrians would have been in favour of this plan
When I read the video title I immediately thought it might have been about an episode of "Last Of The Summer Wine" I had missed!
Well it would have made episodes of Heartbeat interesting.
love a bit of north york moors content
Tfw it was nuked already and they just kept the secret, they're just waiting to unplug the hole
london would be better
Can’t help but imagine a very bored Treasury clerk dreaming this one up on a lunch break as a joke.
FOR GODS SAKE DON'T SHOW THIS TO THE PM.
"There was never a high level meeting where government officials sat and decided to nuke a bit of a national park"  Sorry Tom but I call bollocks. I've seen the Tories. There's no way they don't sit swilling brandy and asking each other "Should we nuke the north?" at least twice a week.
Anyone else surprised Tom has not made a video titled "this video has (X amount of dislikes)" I think it would be cool to hear his thoughts on the whole dislikes thing.
Just to be the worst kind of pedant... Those are the North York Moors, which are in North Yorkshire but they're not the North Yorkshire Moors. To further confuse things the rather lovely railway that runs steam trains from Pickering is the North Yorkshire Moors railway.
Good, I have nothing against getting rid of York.
Idk I think nuking Yorkshire is a great idea
Nuking England? Based   (for legal reasons that's a joke)
I always found this subject fascinating. I love the concept of using something designed for conflict and destruction in a way that benefits humanity. Such a shame Nukes are so radioactive, it's almost like they were designed to make cities uninhabitable.
Tom always answers the questions we never knew we had.
Tom always answers the questions we never knew we had.
I live not too far from North Yorks, I don't want the idea of a nuke going off that close to me'head, I'm still getting around the experience of constant RAF fly-bys.
Tom always answers the questions we never knew we had.
That's lovely to know, bearing in mind my family have lived in the area for decades 😅
Tom always answers the questions we never knew we had.
Tom always answers the questions we never knew we had.
The tories would still do it now given half a chance
Tom always answers the questions we never knew we had.
Tom always answers the questions we never knew we had.
Tom always answers the questions we never knew we had.
Damn
Maybe this is a stupid question but: where was all the soil/rock supposed to go?
Amazing title, Tom. Keep it up.
What goes better than valentine's and nuclear war
Nth Yorkshire may have been saved but earlier (1950's) British tests carried out in Australia contaminated large areas of land. British and Australian soldiers were deliberately exposed to fall out.
Has anyone ever tried this with non-radioactive explosives?
great job, tom. now the secret is out
There was also a plan to set off an atom bomb in the north coast of Scotland. The plan was scrapped because the amount or rainfall in the area!
We were this close to nuking the UK… such a shame, we could’ve freed Ireland
Thankfully the UK has become a peace-loving nation and has gotten rid of their nuclear weapons.
*Goes to Goole*  You maniacs! You did it!
Ah. The good old days where there was no stigma about nukes.....
THE WHAT
uhh... happy valentines day?
I love these crazy stories from the cold war era, I remember reading about Operation Plowshare, I didn't realize they UK planned it also.
This is amazing! As it happens, I know someone in Glaisdale with more than a passing interest in nuclear energy and power - I'll be sure to send them this video!
Should have done it. The cavern would now be a tourist attraction.
They did this in Colorado and New Mexico too! They detonated a nuke in Rulison, CO to liberate a bunch of natural gas. It actually worked, but the gas was too contaminated with radiation to use. The local museum I work for has an archive of photos from that project.
Crazy that.
It's just a bigger dynamite stick, no worries... ;-)
Unless they were....
On second thought, let's not nuke the North Yorkshire Moors. It is a silly plan.
god... the 60's were a crazy time
wouldnt it be the *most* secret?
maybe move it to kent
damn cool
0:28 Ti’s also gods county lad
I'd love to meet the Berties, Ralphs, colins and Wilfs that thought up this plan
Great video.
Doesn’t sound like a good plan…
Pickering lesss gooo
Interesting.
"Top secret" uploads a video to 5 million of his subscribers
Just a little forgotten historical tidbit: the report is written using the CGS system - check old physics text books which use it - which is a pre-SI system of standard metric measurements invested in the UK by James Clerk Maxwell among others and was widely used alongside imperial measurements in scientific and engineering circles in the UK from the late 19th century before being phased out by modern SI system.
Epic
My grandparents live in Pickering, and tbh if the bomb had gone off, it would have explained a few things 😂😂
wish they did
Imagine being the author of that paper and 50 years later there's a video about it.
Didn't the Soviets use a nuclear bomb to stop a oil well fire?
Wait…. Archive? I sense the assistance of everyone’s favorite Gary Brennan, Gary Brennan.
Yeh the massive earth-moving via thermonuclear weapon had the nasty effects of contaminating the earth and water involved. This means it can't be used to create reservoirs of any sort without having to wait 100s of years for it to cool down.  About the only use that even came close to making sense is a shipping canal where the water would be discharged into an open ocean and not used for  anything else. Then it may have been OK for the few days a ship may be present in the canal, but making sure it doesn't leach anywhere else is very difficult.
This is why I question government spending... They took the time to write this report.
I'm expecting a kurzgesagt video titled "should we nuke the North Yorkshire Moors?"
interesting seeing the document showing the cost of a nuke and that it's a lot cheaper than your average London house.
I would have peacefully nuked north Yorkshire, not much there anyway.
Did Australia say no? The 50's were enough for them?
Tom is a teacher that people needs in School
It is about time the world came together to do one last nuclear test to film it with todays technology for everybody. It obviously could be done with no possible harm to humans if done in a very remote part of the planet. I’m also sure a lot can still be learned from it now with the instruments we have.
Thank you, thumbnail. Very informative
Surprising
Wake up babe. New Tom Scott video just got uploaded
Nuclear fracking, because just one of the two isn't scary enough
The scariest bit is, is maybe in a further restricted document it says they decided to go ahead with this on a smaller scale, and we just never knew.
As someone who enjoys wikipedia dives when they can't sleep, you find all sorts of wild things in random tangent research.
I watched this thinking about how reckless and naïve they were with nuclear energy back then and how little they knew. Then I remembered that only a couple years ago a sitting US president suggested nuking a hurricane.
If they could miniaturize a hydrogen bomb, you could reduce the residual radiation significantly.
I think you spelt France wrong
How did you reattach your jaw that literally dropped? British medicine is amazing. Jokes aside: amazingly captivating video as always.
On the other side of the pond, the USA experimented in the 60s with using cruise missiles *to deliver mail.*  The Cold War was the Wild West of 20th century science
during the cold war, around the same time the united states and israel thought of making a canal to rival the suez canal that way, they also decided against the idea eventually
We should still do it
Maybe they should've, at least it would look better
I created my channel for this moment.
Tom is too smart for the world.
I'm sure you could do something like that today with conventional ordnance, a large shaped charge blowing downwards. a lot more predictable, no need for expensive fissile material, no radiation.  in the 60's maybe not so much though XD
What if, instead of a shovel… hear me out… we use nukes?  I agree, the newer generations _are_ worse.
My favorite nuke testing story is still the manhole cover that got launched into space. … but this is right up there.
"It was a bad idea" 😂
I’m sorry da what?!!!
Imagine the irony of creating an underground Fallout shelter using a nuke
Yet another great video. Cheers Tom.
Great video as always
Extra points for being a Yorkshire-based fact
Did the Gas Council have offices in Lancaster by any chance?
Yes
It would also theoretically be possible to create a very primitive fusion reactor by building a giant cavity, filling it with water, and setting off a hydrogen bomb in it and using the resulting vaporized water to drive something like a few hundred million turbines.
Sometimes, when I find, shall we say, _members of a particular older generation_ to be irrationally resistant to things like nuclear power plants that could provide millions upon millions of megawatts of relatively clean energy, I have to remind myself that their parents were constantly trying to do absolutely mad things like this.
Given how rapidly Whitby's cliffs and seaside streets are falling into the sea, plus many of it's buildings being hundreds of years old, an underground explosion like that might just have collapsed several buildings, if not more
In an alternate universe: _Ey up, duck! Yer positively glowin', 'ave a good day up t' nuclear hole, love?_
Would be the most epic conclusion to find out that yes, they actually nuked the place, and just rebuild the ravine and never talked about it in public.
interesting bit of history.
"It's the bomb that didn't go off. The danger no one knew was real. That's the bomb with the real power to change the world."
Why is so much of England deforested
"Peaceful nuclear explosions would eventually be banned by treaty"  Good decision! Next step: Ban hostile nuclear explosions...
Huh
Okay but can we talk about the part where the nuke itself would only have cost £164,000
In a different reality, this video is titled "The giant nuclear gas cavern under Yorkshire" where Tom is wearing a red radioactive suit
I just did a report on the plowshares in Colorado. Radiation in the natural gas was not the issue, the cost of the warhead and public outcry were. A lot of natural gas wells go through formations containing uranium and thorium and is naturally radioactive so that can be fixed.
I doubt it was a coincidence that they were banned after we learned they were a bad idea.
Wow just reading the video title made my jaw drop. Wonderfully interesting video Tom 😁✨
The just dropped it in South Yorkshire instead judging by the cities and towns there
Sad to see it didn't happen. We could have been ridden of Yorkshire Tea. (I'm joking Yorkshire, don't be mad!)
OTOH, more gas storage would be a boon right now
Elo
It's interesting how in that time period how they wanted to use splitting the atom. From portable mini power stations  to making deep water harbours for ships.
for some reason before tom said "lower" i imagined them flying a bomber over a natioanl park for the bomb to perfectly go down the hole and explode
“When I was a lad, they tried to explode a nuclear bomb in the middle of the road.” “Luxury”
I totally thought the title said "My top secret plan to explode a nuclear bomb in Yorkshire," and I bust out laughing
The best clickbait title that is also accurate
Never knew nuclear bombs have nicer use cases
If you think about it, in the long run, Chernobyl was a successful use of nuclear fission to create a wildlife reserve  Plants and animals flourished in the exclusion zone after all the people were evacuated
Living and working in Lancashire - straw poll of the office says they should nuke Yorkshire now?!?
That's why you make scientific reports. Instead of just saying surely that's a good/bad idea, investigate without prejudice, and make a report on why this exactly *is* a good or bad idea.   Not like the Germans shutting down nuclear power, just because a portion of the voters feel nuclear power is more dangerous than coal. And at the same time doesn't want power lines going from where sun/wind power is generated to where the power is to be used.
I used to live in Bradford and it's hard to argue that a bijou, Hiroshima-scale nuke, like the one in the study, wouldn't have been an improvement.
Where is Gary in all this
Maybe interview the authors?
what I should have taken away from this: they were going to blow up a nuclear bomb about a mile away from my house! what I actually took away from this: Tom Scott was about a mile away from my house!
Let's hope that Michael Bay guy screwed up his maths
“top secret”
What a shame, would have loved a nuked national park. How many tourists would that attract? I'd definitely give it a visit.
If someone does create a coastal bay area using a nuke, they'd have to call it the Michael Bay
I'm from Yorkshire.  Most of the Northerners I know wouldn't be bothered by such an explosion.  "' 'appen I need t'sunglasses!  Mutha, get thee me sun lotion".
Or in fifty years time you'll read the recently declassified document telling you that the creek chosen in the end was the one behind that hill. Cheap gas storage, yayyyyy!
The _Thunderbirds_ equivalent would be a conventional digging machine powered by a nuclear reactor.
I have a sneaking suspicion that whatever was plugging the hole would have been blasted into space.  Also that the resulting cavern might have immediately collapsed in on itself.
1:04 “There’s your new canal” or “There’s your nuke canal”?
Having been to Brimham Rocks myself, it's good to know I wasn't born in the alternate universe where this thing was set off.
Tom out here exposing national secrets
Somehow it never occurred to me to use nuclear bombs the way explosives are used although it is acutally a fairly obvious idea (not a good one though, as one might have noticed)
Interesting video tom
Please don't give Putin ideas...
Often bad ideas just keep getting put on the bottom of the stack until it is sufficiently old to just archive and forget about it. In other words, this is likely the 'bad idea' that was never even properly acknowledged.
They should explore this as a possibility again. Scarborough Borough Council would sign this off in no time.
Hi Tom, is there any way to see you in person? Do you do lectures, presentations, etc? Thanks, Andrew
Tom we all know that this story has been written by the IA sound to good of a story to be true 😂
So this is how Pride and Prejudice and Zombies happened!
Nuclearshire
I see the Brits also liked their drugs back in the '60-'70.
Æ
Absolutely wacky
Wow Tom Scott makes a video about a topic I've heard about before. Incredible work!
as someone from yorkshire who has severe anxiety, the title terrified me :)
Do it, please. I beg you.
Bomb go boom
This idea still has potential, they should do it in the centre of Bradford or Milton Keynes...
its crazy what peple have thoght of doing
WHY NT SLOUGH?!?!
Still would be nicer than Bradford
Looks very secret
I now need a "a possible future" from Tom talking about what if they did decide to nuke the underground of a national park
53 seconds ago nice
Why not. Government already screwed over two Yorkshire counties. Why not screw over a third?
Reminds me of Dr Who Invasion Earth film
This is like the plot to the Armageddon movie.. just terrestrial 😅
In an alternate reality, China builds the Nicaragua Canal using peaceful nuclear detonations. That would have been crazy.
Someone had way too much time on their hands to think this up
Having been too Yorkshire I am not convinced this wasn’t actually done without anyone noticing.
Very nice vid Tom.
Should have done it
Bro what did the river do why they wanna nuke it poor river it has a family
Fascinating Tom ! Can you please do a video on the U.K. current nuclear war plan. The current bunkers and the plan in place to protect/ save HM Government. If the worst ever happens with the Russians and we enter general nuclear war. I know tens of millions die. Yet the U.K. must still have a plan even in 2022 for nuclear Armageddon. Anything on this rather grim subject at this moment would be awesome. Much is known of America’s civil and military preparedness. The bunkers etc. Almost nothing is known about 🇬🇧 nuclear war planning in 2020s. Thanks again for amazing content. Kind regards.
I see tom has started new types of thumbnails, an image along with a bold arrow and a few words in bold!
Made it here for my town
I can’t believe someone wants to blow up north Yorkshire
Didn't even realize I was watching this within 1 min of upload
they did this the radioactive wasteland made from it is called Nottingham and Birmingham
Nukes in Yorkshire? Call Jay Foreman.
Imagine taking a nice stroll in the park and you just hear a loud rumbling from below...
Me in north Yorkshire and seeing this title 😶
Welcome everyone, get ready for some knowledge
Its so top secret that we know about it
The green green beans were good but not good at the green beans beans or beans and beans or the other
ayy posted  1 minute ago
The following are you
this guy finds everything idk how
The good news
That’s a waste of a nuke. Nuke blow jo’s house
Atomic national park? Why not!
Radioactive Yorkshire men... The horror.
swag yolo
Good doctor and I have to go back home
Great! New video from Tom! Thank you for your work!
My reactions whilst reading the title: Tom… you probably shouldn’t be showing this WAIT WHAT… YORKSHIRE!
Would anyone actually notice if Yorkshire was wiped of the map
Nice hopes it go's well
Tom scott and ted ed uploaded seconds apart. What a day
And that's how yorkshire tea was mutated to taste good
ooh fancy
Slather
Woah!
Yorkshire could have been the UK's Nevada
ayyy looks like a good one
Ask your dad
I’m not sure how Tom gets these video ideas
YORKSHIRE!!!! YORKSHIRE!!!! YORKSH—
As a person with anxiety, I have to see this.
Hi
At least I don’t live in England, I live in Aberdeen , Scotland
HOW DID YOU GET MY PLAN???
Do it
Average British government
WOW!
hi tom
Zero views 70 likes hmm
Wow, I've never had this idea that nuclear bombs could be used to for peace and not for war.
May we go for dinner
*Boom*
Use your phone code
"top secret plan"  *is on youtube*
Bruh Tom Scott what you doing???
Cool
Wow
🧢
Ooo no views
Why do random tiny towns in the UK always have some relation to explosions
Like second I think
why not
What are you planning Tom?
second
Cap
33s ago I'm fast
XD

Yorkshire will be eliminated
Alright
blow it up
"It's Valentine's Day, Tom! People are doing all sorts of romantic content, what are y— never mind."
