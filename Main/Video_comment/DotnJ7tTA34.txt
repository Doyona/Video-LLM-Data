Watch the first episode of #HouseoftheDragon for free here https://youtu.be/XrMdo8jF5Dg A new episode is streaming Sunday night on HBO Max.
House of the Wyverns if you know you know 😂😂😂
lol family members fighting over who sits on the throne. So dumb if it was another family then ok but they’re all Targaryens makes no sense
This serie is so horrible, just to say the least, and season 2 ... oh boy, what a disaster. Woke multiculturalism at it's finest.
Un sous game of trônes...
I'm bouta watch season 1 and 2 again to get the vibes going 😭😭 omg I'm excited, been waiting‼️
oh the world thinks this is fiction
Pls release the 3rd and final seasons. I'm done waiting for series to come after after 4 years just for 8 episodes
Sky & Netflix   Good Adventure 🇬🇧
Please someone help me with bgm of this trailer
Does this get any better? Currently watching season 1 - there are about -5 characters in total, and it's like Young and the Restless with 80% of the story about a couple of their love lives...and that's it. If Fugging SUCKS. Points for diversity though. 🙄
I am watching the episode 6 right now, and this show is sooooo dull and boring so far. The show feels something more like The Crown or Downton Abby, than The Song of Ice and Fire. Nothing happens but conversation between loyal families, who’s gonna marry who, who the princess slept with, the dignity of the loyal family etc etc. I hope it will eventually get interesting, otherwise it’ll be the Downton Abby with few dragon flying scenes.
I just finished the last episode of Game of Thrones and after that, nothing seems good in front of John Snow.
GOT has its own nightmare not because of their Knights or House of the Dragon.
*king wrong choice (like a comedy actor), king's daughter wrong choice, costumes and jewelry wrong choice, the structures are very artificial, should have been much simpler*
Should i watch House of the dragon or  Game Of Thrones first ?
It is not at the level of the first seasons of GOT... also the second season is too much filler between Rhaenyra and Alicent
#film
Film
Movie
they planing to bring on the 3 th season or they left whitout cash ?:)))
Just you wait till The knight of the seven kingdoms drop. Thats going to be a big deal
The thing i don't like in the show i wish they hadn't jumped so much time all at once, all the time...  SPOILER   For example, i really would have liked to see Viserys, Alicent, and the others reactions to Rhaenyra and Daemon's marriage
Super 👌
I put so many people on to game of thrones I should be payed lol but house of dragons is not that good to be making us wait two years for a season. Honestly last season was a let down
hahah You thought you'd make it? What a TERRIBLE prequel of GoT. What a SNOOOZEFEST! Whoever wrote it should in a walk of shame hahaha SHAME! SHAME! 🤣 I know exactly this going to get cancelled because, even at season 1 epi 2, the boringfest is too much. I literally fall asleep while watching it. Terrible producer also, they literally on the budget.
Had to give the black guy dreads, cause….you know
HOTD S1 clears 90% of the shows y’all hype. If you disagree, your taste just isn’t evolved yet 🐉🔥
This is such a DOPE trailer! This show has SUCH POTENTIAL to reach the popularity of Game of Thrones! The war, politics, dragons aspects are sooo good! The only thing I feel like can be developed further are the characters! They’re not as complex or multifaceted as GOT but they’re still interesting enough… I wish the writers could delve upon them in the upcoming seasons, the possibilities of HOTD being just as good as GOT
Uhh, is this show any good?   I LOVED GOT, but that ending was brutal!    Is House of Dragons any good?
Definitely my favorite show
Omo this movie na hit Nigeria no even fit act am😅😅😅😅😅😅❤❤❤❤❤❤
Will they also show the faceless men in the House of Dragon?
Amd the most amazing thing i liked about HOTD is the bond btw a dragon and his rider eg. Carqxes screqms when daemon gets shot, Syrax screams when Rhaneyra was in labour
HOTD gave us war, romance, tension, suspense, politics, dragons, essos all in 1 season . Got gave us so unnecessary scenes like Jaime road journey, Arya 2 season in bravos, Samwell Tarly stupid journey i mean pick up the pace
Watching House of Dragons 2025 🔥 we need more series of this amazing episode and continue on the story
I am sold at where is duty , where is sacrifice
I’m on the last episode of Game of Thrones tonight, and this one is my next series to binge-watch! I can’t waittt
0:44 so this sh*t is woke too? Yeah I'll pass.
Background Music name pls
best anime
Season 4 please
An Absolute Cinema 🙌
House of the dragon
What is the sound track name in the background. I like it.
Ramin Djawadi better be in EVERY Game of Thrones spinoff, because he is just amazing!
Just don't care.
This wasn't eventual. You understand. You northman. Me not. Yet.
Sind da in der Serie Schauspieler die auch bei herr der Ringe mit gespielt haben ?
☄️☄️☄️☄️☄️☄️☄️
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
After Season 1 Episode 5, they switch BOTH MAIN ACTORS and skip ahead qp tears while ignoring a giant cliffhanger that happened in episode 5. WHAT THE ACTUAL ****.
Bring out the new season already
Just do Raised by Wolves season 3!
If there ever were real dragons I think they nailed it
GoT from Ali Baba 😭
House  of the Dragon
Anyone know this soundtracks title?
ايش اسم المسلسل لو تكرمت
Worst series, Full of baseless story Dragon apear for fraction of second. The Name should be House of Idiots.😂😂
This is got from wish
perfect goode show ruined by ideology crap
Hmm, must’ve been  an ethnic cleansing in Westeros at some point
❤❤❤
They put their heart and soul into this season. But season 2 was mid af.
Why does the main character have to be a girl and why is there a black man from the Targaryen wtff?
Where is the original trailer audio?!? Who edited/changed it?!? This sound is making my ears bleed….EWWW
Movie nme
Like a games of thrones series
Imagine that brad pitt from troy(2004) act some targaryen 🤩
Targaryens aren't black....hard pass👎
Just finished watching HOTD season 2, can't wait for season 3, i just hope it doesn't go the same way as GOT 🍻🍺
Houseo fthe
حلقة 3 الان 😮😮😮
Game of thrones is the best
OKAY DAY ONE OF WATCHING THIS NOWWW!!!
Budget series..  Very disappointed after 15 minutes.
This series after or before game of thrones?
Season 1 was the best!!!!! Here from 2024
5381 Osinski Plains
9.5/10 for one season and a half. After that it became childish drama with stupid and annoying "politically right" clown fiesta story. Don't know if its even worth watching season 3 because we could see which direction this goes, so sad they didn't stick with directors and writers who did season 1.
Let's Starts With Episode 01.... Already Goosebumps 🔥☠️
after episode 5… what happened…cast changed lots of kids…😂😂😂 Bored to death..
GoT chines version 😂😂
HBO wasted the perfect moment to put out the fire and reassure fans that they realized what a mistake they made by cutting the budget and reducing the number of episodes to 8 in season 2. They could also add that in season 3 the budget will be increased and the number of episodes increased to at least 10. Instead, they decided to pour water...
Just finished all the episodes of season 1  Overall 6/10  5 Sep 2024
I still miss game of thrones hope they will continue with the same story
Time waste series house of dragon  Game of thrones best series ❤
This is worst than the young and the restless
guys need a help!!   I want to watch this show,  so in which platform?  is it  HBO Max, original  or Amazon Prime video?
Bonjour à tous
woke trash
Little late info about this series:👇🏻 King Viserys I, father of Queen Rhaenyra is the 8th great-grandfather and 7th great-grandmother of Jon Snow.
Hats off to the editor who fools us by showing Rhaenerya against Rhaenerya😂😂
I’ve learnt a valuable lesson. When there’s hype before the release of a series. It’ll be trash 🗑
اشوكت تطلع حلقه 9مال جز الثاني
I wish they did more eragon movies to this level or even make it a show.
looks like game of thrones from temu
موت موت
Watching this trailer again after the end of Season 2. This trailer itself a lot better than the whole season 2
Tomorrow season 2 ends 😢😢
Tell me wrong... but I see this series as an old fairytale where an evil stepmother is jelouse of her stepdaughter.
they don't realize how guilty they look, or just don't care!
2:25 which dragon is it ?
1 сезон был лучше чем нынешний
Rhaenyra ❌️ Lesbonyra (whorenyra)✅️  Long live king Aegon the rightful heir
Wish George would have finished his series instead of this slop
Never watched any Game Of Thrones but this looks pretty cool
Is there way more dragons in this show?
Feel me? We wuz Vuh-larry-uns
They could’ve made this a show starting with Aegons conquest and could’ve printed money
Next HBO Series will be about the doom of valaria❤❤❤
GAME OF THRONES IS WAY ABOVE THIS STUPID MOVIE.....WITH 2 DOLLARS ACTORS AND SCRIPT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   I SAW 5 EPISODES, THEY CHANGE THE ACTORS , BUT NOT ALL OF THEM, SOME OF THEM GOT OLD AND SOME NOT,.....WTF ?????????????????   I DONT RECOMAND TO ANYONE  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I VOTE THIS SF  -10/10 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Boring it is Garbage
Boring 0:27
Doesn’t come close when comparing the cast from GOT, hard to watch this series only cos of the cast difference
?
Sadly his dream was a warning 😔
T h i s  h a s  b e e n  a  v e r y  s l o w  s t a r t  s o I  h o p e i t  p i c k s u p  e v e n t u a l l y
there's no hot good looking actors in this show, male or female. the knight was hot but he turned out to be real POS & not like a hot bad guy but an insufferable prig who is mean to kids because they're bastards, but the hypocrite is doing the queen.
Game of thrones is a wonderful series 👌❤ love from India 🇮🇳 #GOT ❤️
Has to be the ugliest cast I’ve ever seen
Absolutely terrible.
I actually think this is a really bad show… game of thrones was wayyyy better
Is this like a sequel to game of thrones? How does it tie in?
I love This series ❤
Why does it look so "cheap" compared to game of thrones?
This show sucks, it's not even in the same league as Game Of Thrones.
Winter is Coming
Can't compare this with game of thrones
They lost me at dragons
I’ll admit I had zero hope for this, but I’ll happily admit I was wrong
Do we see a return to Game of Thrones with a different flavor?
HBO and GRRM was so ahead of their time, making the sequel show a decade before the prequel Also thank you HOTD for introducing me to this awesome family and show
Look how many people disliked this, but then ended up eating crow.
I will watch the series when asoiaf is done.
i just finished game of thrones and now looking forward to watch House of Dragons, I hope i will enjoy it as much as i enjoyed game of thrones
looks so embarrassing. why dont they put one of the Tramsformers on the throne or give the kingdom to Hulk, that cant possibly make this mess any worse.
If you liked House Of The Dragon , check these out: 1. Thieves Of The Wood (2020 series) 2. The Kings Affection (2021 series) 3. The Lord Of The Rings The Rings Of Power (2022 series) 4. Brave (2012 film) 5. Knightfall (2017 series) ... Visit Stryvia to find your next favourite!
Looks tedious.
Epic💯
J’ai adoré la saison 1 et pour moi c’est la meilleure série 🎉❤ rdv le 16 juin 🐉🖤
Shiny, shiny - Shiny boots of leather...
Cannot wait for Rhaenyra's death scene when killed by Aegon's dragon in front of her own son
Half of this is likely CGI/AI.. that’s not acting,. Thats not worth watching/ Hollywood is the fakest it’s ever been.
House of the Dragon ist sch...Kein Vergleich zu GoT! Keine Figur mit der man sich auch nur halbwegs identifizieren kann.
🎂🎂🎂
Los caxcanes
Why song changed?
We wish to see Balerion the black dread, in any upcoming new show or episode
i just now watch all of house of the dragon ome cool show  love it
This show is nothing like GOT. An eye pocking CGIs everywhere from cities to dragons. I watch it but the production as just average. I’m sorry
Wonderful series, thanks for making such a web series
Hulu nya di au api roh kudus
Love what your doing with the show, can't wait to see what's next 😉
House of the Dragon was amazing!! So happy to see new stories set in Westeros. 😊
I remember how excited I was for this! But I'd be even more excited if you renewed Our Flag Means Death for its third and final season!
who was the last dragon shown?

The now they see you as what you are
Great show unlikeable characters Rhaenyra not convincing looks like a boy in puberty all females look reversed
The queen is not beautiful.shes supposed to be very beautiful...😢😢😢😢
This makes Amazons Rings of Diverse Girl Power a pure embarassment
When I first started watched this, I really thought the battle was going to be Rhaenyra against Daemon. I also thought we was going to see a lot more scenes of Rhaenyra and Rhaenys.. amazing show but I really think they could of slowed down the pace and gave us more time with the characters, built the relationships..
Copy paste, same game off thrones
Seeing stuff like this makes me super excited for the Eragon Tv Series that will be coming out!
Tf just happend to background music?
Loved the first 5 episodes. Then they change the allisent girl queen and the best one Rhenaryis.  WTF. The new actors don't have the same chemistry as the first ones. I could barely get through episode 6.  Don't care for it anymore. Bummer. Bad move changing characters like that.  Bad move.
trailer really makes it look like the war was between rhaenyra and daemon
Danaerys targaryen is watching this from GOT😂
Waiting for season 2 of HOTD! I loved that choking scene wich Absolutely match the GOT universe and the characters, don't understand why people didn't get the point. Go authors go! You do it perfect! Thanks❤
A masterpiece
Please 🙏 😢
Hello sar kya aapki YouTube video main Apne YouTube channel per uploaded kar Sakta hun
I love how they made it seem the main conflict would be between Daemon and Rhaenyra, at least for those who haven't read the books. Only the scene where Rhaenyra tells Daemon that Alicent would stop her from ascending gives it away completely. I would have totally missed that if I were a casual viewer.
AND NO  WAR SO BLOODY AS A WAR OF DRAGONS  🐉🐉
No
Hope its good 👍
Can’t wait ❤❤❤
i'm here for the new teaser 😎
Waiting for the new trailer while watching this one!!!!!
Thank god now we can Now the history of GoT
I have no nices only nephews my only complaint.
New teaser tomorrow
Hurry up 2024😢
❤
1 year later still waiting for the 2nd season 🐲❤
Most boring sequel...talking ..talking...dragon is for name shake....
Does anyone know the music used in the trailer?
So far House of Dragons series 1 has had me strapped and has my full attention. ❤  I just hope its last season does not make the first season feel pointless in its story.....like the way season 8 of Game of Thrones made me feel. ☠️
Season 2 please!!
Bring on the second season Hail the Rogue Prince 🤍
Tasteless diversity casting
I'm rewatching these trailers in preparation for S02 trailer!!
copy of game of thrones
Not a fan of the time jumps in this series.
Matt Smith And Ewan Mitchell are the best part of the series! Can't wait to see them in action in season 2!
here in 2023 end re-watching the trailer for season 1 cause i cant wait any longer for season 2
How to download this series

This is the best show, season 1 is already better than Game of Thrones
Can’t wait for season 2 to drop. The trailer should be out in the next month hopefully.
Take the time if you going to make 2nd season, I don’t mind, take time but do it right not the garbage season 7 of game of thrones.
What's the name of this track?
Can whatch this if didn't whached GOT
This bored me
Im here just to say that this show sucks. I didnt get a point why there are black people among Tagrariens?
Hahahaha... no matter how good it is. I will never see it. Game of thrones is over
Horribly boring 🥱
They changed the faces of some characters, that was really ANNOYING and it actually cheapens the quality of the show, and, they needed to put the white-haired black people in it?😳😳😳 In the era that this show is set, no black people were royals or nobles wtf
thank god for this trailer, looking back at them now after having watched the show and seeing how phenomenal it is, it’s amazing how the other trailers and teaser did a bad job marketing it. Maybe the trailer company wanted to avoid spoilers or had little footage ready (visually they weren’t great either, they maybe didn’t have the color corrected final footage, so they just put a filter on raw footage) but it’s crazy that the show survived after such poor first look, but this trailer does a great job condensing how intense the story is without spoiling anything, I wonder if it’s made by a different trailer company.
Is it just me or everyone hates the Hightowers ?
A must watch...
What happen to Meraxes children Sunburst ( the golden terror ), Sunder  ( the red shy queen dragon), Shatterstone ( The curious ).   If i am not mistaken they should be older than Dreamfyre and Vermithor why they never got mentioned.   And it was never they died and i am hoping they are also residing in Dragonstone if the writter changes the story i would rather love to see Rhaneyra claiming Sunburst and Sunburst facing and killing Sunfyre. The battle of golds.
looking like another feminist series
Anyone know the score they have used in trailer?
Show is a woke fest of try hards 😂😂😂. Total disappointment.
Hero looks like earling Holland
What is this? Iss this the story before game of thrones when Daenerys was an adult?
1 year of HotD ♥️  Can’t wait for season 2! Now please cast daeron and Cregan!!!
It was better than Got
❤
trailer doesn't do the show justice, watching it I expected a simple story of jealous uncle stealing the throne from a woman because she's a woman, but I've received complex characters with conflicting motivations and mature storytelling, it was very good
It's rare for an entire season to be this badass from beginning to end.
So they rushed game of thrones just to make this trash? Should’ve just kept game of thrones going
This should be called house of Alabama lol
I can’t wait to see nettles Cregan stark and daeron targaryen next year! season 2 will be awesome
Waiting for season 2.
Girl lost her father, the iron throne, new born kid , second son in a span of 1 week. I feel bad for her honestly
Watched 1 episode of this and didn’t understand a single thing
A masterpiece!
HBO in Famous that's why Game of thrones part of this ott. But its insulting time.every dog ​​has its day 😂😂😂hehe
& Who's like this series this person cheap & Duffers
Very Bed Series when its Name Including with Game of thrones . Shame &  Dirty Sham
Cool. Can't wait😊
Hey, watching my hives inflammation fade day after day until they completely vanished was such a relief, I went with what I pointed out and within the first 10 days or so the urticaria/angioedema was barely visible! I just go'ogled the latest by Shane Zormander and after 20 days my skin has never been healthier!
I love house of ra
Manchester city star Erling Halaand is from the dragon country....
Honestly house of the dragon sucks… it doesn’t have character building, the story line doesn’t have direction and  story is too fast. Benioff and Weiss understood how to capture the story and uncover little hidden secrets and give us suspense and mystery and we knew all the characters very well as an audience. And for each character, we understood their history and future. There’s a good build up to the story of game of thrones. I just wish game of throne had the same budget and production from season 1 😢
💫💫💫💫💫
hands down maybe my favorite trailer ever
does this one have the MAD KING story?
One question, as rhaenys was elder than viserys why none of her children  was elder than rhaenyra. i don't know if it makes any difference or it doesn't really matter ????
Where I can watch this whole season?
Mad respect
I think in the next 10 to 15 years we are going to see alot of viewers taking a break from television.  People in there late 30s and older. We are reaching a point where even the best tv shows are somewhat redundant.  I really think we have a TV drought on the horizon. I mean this show looks like it's the best show on tv and I dont even feel like watching it after spending a decade watching game of thrones and reading the books.
I can’t believe wait for season 2 🐉🐉🐉
this looks like bunch of kids fighting over the throne. stupid show
Omg hab da so bock drauf :,) :,) hab game of thrones so vermisst :,) Endlich wieder in westeros :,)
Can we all please just take a moment to appreciate Paddy Considine's fantastic portrayal of King Viserys? Even GRRM said that he portrayed the character better than in the book.
متئ يعرض الجزء الثاني انا متحمس🙂
This series is nothing compared to G.O.T     total boring 😂
what are the names of rhaenyra's children in the movie House of the Dragon.
I love how they shot with the Real Dragons instead of CGI ❤
watching the trailer after finishing the whole season and WOOOOOOOWWWW everyone in the team who worked to bring this project alive did a TERRIFIC job!! hats off to everyone! hope you guys maintain this quality in the next seasons too and do the dance of the dragons and all my favourite characters justice till the end  InshaAllah ! this show deserves all the nominations and awards! a masterpiece i could watch again and again and again  p.s DAEMYRA is everything!!
honestly i have become a HOD fan so much more than GOT one ! everything about this show is phenomenal ! the chemistry between every single character is outstanding and so rare to see these days . i hope season 2 is even greater which would be really really hard to achieve but i think they can do it. THE casting was also marvellous ! i love MATT SMITH and his portrayal of daemon. he is my new favourite character  i hope they dont stick with his original book storyline and keep him loyal to only rhaenyra/ THEIR CHEMISTRY ON THE SHOW IS unparalled truly! TEAM BLACK FTW also dont even get me started on the dragons, im so attached to every single one of them its gonna kill me to watch the battle. THE team did such an amazing job making different personalities and everything for each dragon, my favourite is caraxes syrax and melleys
Doctor Who be wildin
It is an application that displays all episodes
Team green forever
Its different from got and love it ❤❤
So why all this uproar was done is crazy. Why didn’t the king have his daughter crowed when he became incapacities since he was physically unable why couldn’t she just take over? I mean Otto and  alicent did anyway
❤️❤️
Did fantastic job with hotd
This was a big success I watch it with all the pleasure ❤
Boraing
I watched Season 1 and thought it was really good. So went back and am watching all of GOT and quickly realized why I stopped watching it. GOT is so slow. I honestly don't understand what all the hype is about. I like it, but the majority of it is just so slow compared to House of the Dragon. I'm forcing my way through it...only because I really enjoyed the prequel.
Happy to see a great successor  of game of thrones ❤️🔥
Series leaped forward too fast. A couple of episodes in, and suddenly, everyone is grown up.  Missed out on multiple seasons of slowly developing characters. Should have kept the original daughter.  The dragons are appealing, but the original series survived for so long due to the realization that the people are the cake, the dragons are the icing.
Ihart u circus bruce bruce
How this serie has 93% rotten tomatoes!!??!?!??! It's really worst than GoT, superfast summarized story telling, changing actors, terrible plot. They have a second chance to improve it but doubt it.
Ansioso pela próxima 😍😍😍
Props to Gary Oldman playing the roles of all the dragins
So nice they add some gays again, like it fits well with the LGBTQ brainwashing and the agenda of the leftists marxist ideology, like so many other BS series have today.
I want official Hindi dubbed in India when release in hindi
The music 🎶 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
most boring serie I have seen on HBO💤🙀
I knew House Targaryen had knights.....     I guess this means House Stark is crap compared to House Targaryen. Ned Stark is fine though. No hard feelings.  When I saw Matt Smith as Daemon Targaryen........I laughed, then heard the Joker laugh, then a flashback of Joffrey's line, "I'm gonna put a bloody smile on his face" came back as bloody nostalgia....I wonder how Emilia Clarke and Lena Headley are reacting to this show so far....not to mention Charles Dance too and Peter Dinklage.
Has it been cancelled yet... cause it was poorly written, dull and uninventive. Release these poor actors from this tripe!
Idc what anyone says they did amazing making this 👏 was a brilliant watch certain characters are lovable that shouldn't be.. its odd but thats brilliant writing
HBO gone Netflix!  House of the Incest, Pedophilia, Gay, Multi-Racial, Mixed-Race,  Feminist, and Anti-Patriarchal Propaganda
Nice edited trailot #movieregular
Welcome back HBO.. glad to have you back .. that same feel when Westworld was released.. goosebumps
Let's hope they don't ruin this series like Game of thrones Although it seems that they do since the writers are green team and the public is black team...
pls give us 4 seasons
Loved it untill episode 6 where they changed the frikking cast😅. Feels like got season 8 already
I've got watch this with my man
The one and only series I'm waiting for season 2 Better drama than GOT
BORING ... 😴😴😴
This is how you do fantacy      Not that ROP garbage
Copy of (game of thrones)
Huge Respect For Ramin Djawadi  For Making GOT BGM at Different Level 🔥🔥
They've changed the music in this trailer
Bgm name
Waiting patiently for season 2!!
Season 1: Tasteless script, tasteless action, tasteless dialogue, tasteless actors... Are you planning to provide pillows for season 2?🤔
Liking it a lot, but good grief…if the scenes are any darker we won’t be able to see the actors at all! Lol
LOL
THIS IS A INSULT OF G.O.T..😞😞😞
house of the dragon is legit one of the best show i have ever watched. It kept me intense the whole season. There wasn’t one episode where i felt boring. I give this show a rating of 9/10 because the character changes was hard to swallow but this show did justice.
The show change the Characters after season 4 was a drastic change.
Freaking love this show! Disappointed I have to wait till 2024 for season 2

Hi can someone confirm where I can get the original soundtrack to this trailer? It has been changed recently and is not as good.
I did absolutely love this season and thought it was great♥️ But ..I did feel like GOT was a step up. The characters, just everything about GOT was epic. And the dragons ♥️🐲 Always epic ♥️
If you actually start watching it, it's mostly just standing around talking,  I flicked through it but it seemed it's all like that!!! Nothing like GOT , not even close . Forget it.
Has anyone noticed that the trailer's music is somewhat different now?
Ehejgeheh

The subtitles are not synchronised
This show is an embarrassment to GOT with its laughable power play and weak characters. Young Rhaneyra was so promising and i thought with the combined power of Daemon we would witness something powerful. How disappointing. Plus the fact that Rhaenyra doesn't even become queen in the books and every character's fate is already known. What made GOT so appealing was the fact that we never knew who would finally end up on the Iron throne. It made everything more compelling and nail biting, and every character more interesting. Here it's hard to root for characters when you already know they won't amount to anything.
Great show!
I love how trailer makes it look like Rhaenyra is Daemon's enemy and Alicent an ally, maybe even lover when it's actually vice versa. Well done HBO
Wow
0:29 song?????

When is part 2???
People condemning Cersei and Jaime for having affairs because they're brothers and sisters but now we all know after watching that the Targaryens also marry each other, siblings, cousins and uncles.
King Viseres the actor should win the best supporting actor award, his acting skills are superb!!
I don't understand the hype. Watched the first 5 episodes and couldn't be bored more. Can someone explain to me why it is good? Srsly I want to start liking it. So far I can only see: boring story, flat, boring characters with weird behaviour, missing interesting conflicts, lack of variety of characters. All interesting characters, the crab feeder dude and Lady Rhea, just die without any proper introduction or role in the show. What made Game of thrones great was the multitude of different characters from different social ranks with different motivations, the wittiness of some of them and the great moves to outplay each other. Random people killing each other without any consequences, like wtf. The characters in house of dragon seem not to do any clever moves and whenever they could do something clever to outplay each other they just choose not to. I don't see any similarity to GoT except that it plays in the same world.

release the trailer OST pls!!!
Daemen is such a demon
Bring Steve Toussaint back for more Valeryon shows!
every time HBO reales one season of GAME OF THRONES world, the world holds its breath.
daenerys targaryen of GOT is just irreplaceable, nevertheless, this series also looks promising let's watch and find out. :)
Had a job keeping up with the repeated change of actors for the same characters.Trying to work out who’s who. Think they overdid the white hair everywhere too,especially on black people.But otherwise very entertaining.
Sean Harris as The Mad King when the time comes please.
Jehejdgeg
This must be a Skyrim movie
Game of Thrones was still a good series, but this is really bad. I watched 6 episodes to notice this. This is like watching the family drama of the royal house and the empowerment of women there. The series lacks all the elements of adventure and combat that made people watch Game of Thrones. At the same time, the biggest part of the king's room turned black as if by magic. That's not surprising at all, but the change can be quite drastic compared to the previous series. I don't recommend watching the series unless you like a soap opera of intersectional feminism with nothing else.
They should change it name: House of Intersectional Feminism
Faltan 1 año y 11 meses para que empiecen las grabaciones de la 2da temporada.
I wish the cast wouldn't have changed...like GoT...I just can't similarise Milly & Emma... They are two different person to me...If they cast Olivia on Big Rhaenyra,that would have been better. 🙂
Perfect season perdect
Already nostalgic. 💚
The music was much better when this trailer first released before they changed it. I didn't even know you could edit a video after it's already uploaded.
When they changed actors around with that jump in time, I wanted to quit watching.. But I am glad that I pushed on, it was a good show overall! Lots of babies and births and dragons and family affairs ☺
So I should watch this show first and then game of thrones ???
Why do black people always end up with blonde hair these days? REALLY !!!! SmFh...!
Dam so I just finished watching game of throne and tbh never felt so sad about a series end definitely my number 1 favorite show 😢😭😭😭  I'm looking forward to watch house of dragon🔥🔥🔥
Absolute Background Score ..💥⚔️
How to explain that black people, wearing such completely covering clothes, in northern climates, get enough vitamin D to prevent rickets and agonizing deaths caused by disease related to deficiency? White people certainly had these problems. Pigmented skin magnifies the problem.
Mad respect to HBO for using real dragons instead of CGI like in Game of Thrones. I hope everyone is safe during filming.
They jammed the gays and the blacks in there real good like.
Just watched the 1st episode and clearly felt the thrill. 😍
We want John snow in the north,

Last night  i completed it .. I can not explain my feeling.. it's amezing .. I am feeling so glad to watch this.... Waiting S2
Get woke go broke
It is just like in real life : if you raise your head and speak up, if you speak the truth...you get killed...the most dissapointing detail I have noticed
What is the name of the soundtrack?
Quatsch 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
So happy to see one particular actor playing his ancestor. You can't miss him. Tall guy :)
Where can I find this soundtrack?
Fire and blood
Semua kerajaan yg memiliki simbol naga 🐲🐉 itu nasabku
Kalian pasti heran kok naga bentuknya orang?  Kok bisa ??  Mau tau?  Wani Piro?
Kalo keluarga nagaku itu disebut dabatul Ardi , kalo keturunan yg skrg, karena bercampur dengan beragam makhluk dalam proses nasab

This one is hard to watch without falling asleep
Incredibly boring
I finally watched the series. The differences between GOT and HOTD is I had reason to care about GOT characters, even from the first episode. However, in HOTD, after the 10th episode, I could care less about any of the characters if they lived or died... but the fact is NOBODY DIED!, unless they had less then 5 minutes of face time.
We need a spin-off series with Henry Cavill playing as the Mad King Aerys II .... come on HBO make this happen
Dynasty for the poor...........next season Tori Spellig  marries  Daemon.......commercial trash.......
As an Africa, I am watching this with a third eye,
Alicet: Where is duty, where is sacrifice? Rhaenyra: Ma'am this is Wendy's 😂
Nada que ver con el señor de los anillos ni el hobbit la verdad muy aburridos los capítulos
Wow just what the world needed more young girls with emotional and daddy issues. Hopefully they can work in some fake gender issues soon and random colors of people from the same families LOL
I did not appreaciate how awesome this trailer was since I was still bitter over Season 8, but now after HotD has wrapped I can see how wrong I was.
The show sucks!
So ive tried to watch this...  what an absolute load of forgetful crap. GOT is miles ahead on story and acting  The dragons are the best actors.
... ... ... ... ... ... ...
Just now finished watching all S1 episodes of HOD  .. It was nice waiting for season 2
More race switching the Velaryons are black just trying to make that quota.
It fkn sux! They talk and talk and talk. Got nothing from the original. Just plain boring.
Esperando pela segunda temporada
A primeira temporada foi incrível. 10/10
Can't wait to see this series. 😊

Segunda temporada por favor
A melhor série do ano sem dúvidas.
A masterpiece
On ep 2 now and I'm wondering..Are they once again going to make us care for a person, only to turn her into a tyrant? Daenerys 2? Or can they leave that stone unturned? I want no copy.
great work except some changes (for example first wife of Daemon)
Hbo should release next Season in Other languages.
What is the trailer music / song ? Thanks
Background music track?
Melhor série do ano
"Evil cannot create anything new, they can only corrupt and ruin what good forces have invented or made." - J. R. R. Tolkien.
There was a handful of scenes from this trailer that I noticed didn't make the final cut. I don't remember Rhaenyra (older) mentioning "she'll block my way" when she was talking with Daemon at Driftmark. Also we didn't see Syrax like the last shot of this trailer in the official show.
Везде этих негров пихают, беловолосые негры, это конечно уже перебор, сериал хороший, но это аж бесит
10/10 ⭐ mind blowing 🔥♥️🇮🇳
House of the Dragon is Fire 🔥 Rings of Boredom is Trash 💩💩💩
too much talking not enough action
Just watched the series. Wow. Can't wait for the second season.
Was a bit disappointed with the first season. Probably bc I want to compare it to GOT and nothing can match that for me. Need some strong characters. There’s not one. That might help some. Hopefully no more time jumps in the future too.
It was not what I was expecting,  I heard good reviews, it was missing alot. The first show of GoT had more entertainment the the whole season of HoD.
if You changed background sound.. its wrong idea.
most boring show ever i practically forced my self to watch till the 5th episode hoping to get better but couldnt, total wast of time how are you guys loving this ?
Waiting for seeing what rheniriya will do for her child's death
What’s the song in this trailer? I can’t seem to find it on the soundtrack.
I want a story about the mad king
is there house of the khal when khal drogo grown up?
PLEASE!! Can we please have ED SPELEERS playing Hugh Hammer or Ulf the White?!??  I NEED to see him riding dragons again!!!!!!
Wo kann man kucken
🤩🤩🐲🐉
HBO , Please open your branch in .. India .. And release your series in .. Hindi ..Language .
This kind looked like How to train your dragon but with Hollywood getting there little boy sacrifice at the end.
This did not end like How to train your dragon did it.
which one should watch first got or this ?????
متى موعد انطلاق الموسم الثاني؟
Muy buena serie pero solo para adultos
After finally finishing the series I can say the show is good only because of team green 💚💚💚💚💚💚💚
Why did The music change?
one of the coolest trailers ever yet somehow the show is still better
Total crap! Thank God for Yellowstone.
Valyrions with black skin but white hair looks sucks
Imagine indeed if all the dragons did roar as one against the army of the dead. Now that is a song of ice and fire.
will there be game of thrones season 9?
Dave Chapple brought me here
Is it the same writers from the first 6 seasons?

Season 2 plz now 😂
Jehejdgeg
I will watch it again.  That is my take on it.  I will watch it again when I have a 10-hour day.  Cause it just dragged on and on.  What I will say is that the little creepy guy who killed those people with a. word and then went to the queen and said "That's what you wanted", reminded me of little finger.
But never beat Game Of Thrones👑 🥱
Why does Aaegon look 30 and Jace look like a normal 17 year old? Bad casting. They're i Isn't much difference in their age but there looks like 15 years difference at least
When Jon snow spin off will come?
that last scene of the dragon close up....which episode is it from? i don't remember seeing it in the show
Game of throne prime
The only thing wrong is now I don’t have a weekly dose of Emma and Olivia! Fuming!
Stupid movie….GOT the best of all time

Viserys ruled for more than 40 years and there were no wars at all.  His wife began to rule and the blood flowed like a river.  It's the same in Game of Thrones.  When Cersei came to power, there was no end to the wars.  Daenerys also shed rivers of blood and ashes.  The conclusion is very simple: WOMENS SHOULD NOT  ALLOW TO POWER. women  (chaos) are too impulsive and unbalanced.
2 Timothy 4:3-5 NKJV 3 For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but according to their own desires, because they have itching ears, they will heap up for themselves teachers; 4 and they will turn their ears away from the truth, and be turned aside to fables. 5 But you be watchful in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.  Romans 6:10 New King James Version For the death that He died, He died to sin once for all; but the life that He lives, He lives to God.

And there will be famines, pestilences, and earthquakes in various places.  👎☠️🦁🍌
It's great to have a story about Daenerys incestors.
If you think watching a medieval show that you'd escape wokism, think again. House of BS

What a depressing pile of junk, it just drones on and on and on and goes nowhere. It’s horrible.

Incredible series  so far!
Game of thrones girls were pretty than house of dragon .... very hedious, how can you cast? 😳
Man!!!!this series was boring at the beginning.....after a few episodes I couldn't stop watching the rest!!! When the end of the season stopped!I was drove!!!!I need season 2 desperately!!!
The historic inspiration behind Game of Thrones and House of the Dragon https://youtu.be/uqHjkkNl_vw
This trailer was misled me. I thought the fight was going to be Daemon vs Rhaenyra for the throne. 😂
गेम ऑफ थ्रोन्स जैसा ड्रामा नही है केवल पारिवारिक झगड़ा है एकता कपूर के शो की तरह जबकि गेम ऑफ थ्रोन्स अलग ही लेवल का शो था गजब के किरदार और उनको निभाने वाले कलाकार, द वॉल, नॉर्थ,टीरियन, सरसी,टाइविन,जिम्मी, सर जोरा, द हाउंड, सर बेरिस्तान सेल्मी, व्हाइट वॉकर, चिल्ड्रन ऑफ फॉरेस्ट, थ्री आई रिबन और भी कई किरदार और लोकेशंस ये सब न भूला सकने वाली यादें Hod मे ऐसा कुछ नही है बहुत सीमित सोच और सीमित दायरे मे बनाया गया सीरियल है
Hahahaha hand of king is spike from notting hill lmao 🤣 😆 😂 😄 😅
Protagonist must be 10 times pretty than previous.... Ranera only 30% pretty of daneyris 😳 she pretty to be airhostess but not actress... especially not of prequels on top series 🤮 daneyris dracareyz was graceful, rahnera dracayres command so weird .... 🤗
This trailer doesn't do HOTD justice, but in someway this trailer plus how GOT ended made us go into HOTD with low expectations, that's probably why it worked so well.
Now that the season is over , this was such a weak trailer for such a great show
I love the way most scenes were filmed in pitch black so the viewers have no idea who is in the scene or what is happening. Brilliant concept.
When I knew the velaryons would be all  black cast I wanted Idris Elba to play Corlys Velaryon.
Già mi manca 😿
Wow, this is really good. I was expecting another Rings of Power train wreck, but no way. Well worth watching.
Chinese copy of GOT .. feel of promoting equalities of races, sexualities etc. is more importing then a subject and screenplay.. it looks that satisfying critics was the goal...lost everything what GOT had..poor try to keep GOT alive..first season totally failure
To all the suckers who fail on this show gl in next 10 years waiting hahaha
This is terrible trailer for a good show, wtf HBO. Check your trailer for GoT Season 3 and go back to your roots.
Such a great season.  Stoked for Season 2.
Plz how know that music in the trailer??!!
all those people who put a dislike on this video are hopefully embarrassed… thinking this would be a “flop”, calling it “woke” 😂😂😂
Who's dragon is the one at the ending scene?
I couldn't even make it past the trailer it's that boring
The show is awesome, can't wait for Season 2.🖤🖤🖤🖤
2:01 to 2:03 where is that scene in series? Which episode
Okay, here's my only theory about lucerys, he's alive, laenor or anyone (a new character in the show) found him. 😭 but damn, I haven't moved on yet
Very boring series.😞😞😞
so the moral of the story is that wamen are better than men and the only way for a wamen to become evil is for a man to turn them to evil, stunning and brave
This trailer is addictive
Having watched the entire season. Where does that shot at 2:24 happen. I cannot remember seeing that shot. It's not Meleys in the dragon pit so what is it.
In answer to those who argue that the prophecy of the 'prince that was promised' was ignored in GOT, it wasn't ignored at all, because it was indeed a 'prince' promised, not a King. John was not meant to be King. As to the argument that Ayra Stark's defeat of the Night King was unexpected and not foreshadowed, or course it WAS foreshadowed in the many (too mnay) episodes concerning her training as a faceless assassin in Bravos, not to mention her ownership of the very same Valerian steel dagger once owned by Peter Baylish, used in an attempt on murdering Bran, and featuring now in House of The Dragon. Same dagger in case no one noticed. The two shows tie in with each other and some things that seemed to have made no sense in 'Thones' will make more sense now. Both shows are brilliant.
A man has watched 1 season, 10 episodes. A man is ready for Season 2.
How is the dragon in the last ? 2:22
Is this the same as Morbius's universe? Ekse ekse
I cannot stand Olivia Cooke...she is such a bad actress and mumbles through her script. How does she ever get any roles????
What a horrible serie! I could not watch it! Such a bad follow up!
This show truly defines GOT it made me emotionally connected to characters can't believe am waiting a whole year for sn2😢😭😭😭😭
BOOOORING!.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
See you in 2024 guys, we had a good run together. “Our hearts remain as one” 🔥
Love it.🖤🔥
I know I'm late but can we get Henry Cavill as the Mad King in the next spin off series
Amazing 👏
The second last episode was a piece of art.
it is like cheap version of GOT🤣😂🤣
porra, o visual mudando de 3ª para 1ª pessoa, isso e uma coisa que a hbo acrescentou mto bem dos jogos para as series, que foi mto foda nas batalha dos bastardos como agora no ultimo ep, parabens hbo inovando nunca vi ninguem fazer algo tao bem,quanto aos jogos, são senas que faz vc respirar fundo, por mais que tenha visto 10x
Having watched season one in its entirety, this trailer undersells it.  Thank you HBO for bringing this awesome show to life, in 4K.
I'm a fan of Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones. House of the Dragon did a great job. Rings of Power sucks.
Shriek
I feel like the problem with a lot of new tv shows is the emphasis on the drama aspect and it just comes out bleak and gloomy.
We didn't get to see that dragon in the end :(
and I thought it will be war between Rhaenyra and Daemon, I was so wrong.
🌈❌I wish that I could understand what language these British people are speaking instead of always having to rewind it or switching to subtitles !!
The best series... Milly, Emma, Matt are 😍❤ Please don't make us wait for too long @HBO....
No Tyrion Lannister or Arya Stark. Not worth watching even though they got Doctor Who to star in it.
Came back after finishing ep 10, this show was amazing, cant wait for season 2
They didnt show the 2:24 scene in the whole season, i was waiting for thta till the last episode,thats gotta be syrax!
We want it in telugu version 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 all other web series's r coming in dubbing...... In india
Is this show any good to watch????
Forced "diversity" ruins another sequel.
We have not seen this scene in the show or am i wrong?  2:25
Wow.. What a first season.. Now my watch begins
The first couple episodes were ok but after that it got boring. Too much talking. Not enough action. It's like a soap opera. The character change in Season 1 episode 6 killed it for me. I couldn't watch anymore after that. Also you should have followed the Stark history not the Targarians. One can only see so much silver hair before it gets old. Amazon's Rings of Power is 50 times better than HOD and I'm saying that as a GOT fan. Anybody who rates this series higher than rings of power has incredibly bad taste.
Daemon 'CHAD' Targaryen
.
Hindi dubd official
I must be going mad. The dragon at the end of this trailer, I honestly don't remember seeing this scene? Which dragon is that?
How refreshing it is to watch this trailer after that epic season!
GOT from wish 😂
What a waste of time!!! Long boring scenes, no enough sub-plots, and characters. Ugly looking actors, same plot tricks; killing a dragon and a prince we have very seen on screen, hardly knew, very poorly developed characters as almost everybody else. Vomit of a series, vomit from horrible ending got.
The show is amazing but rushed too much! They needed another 2-4 episodes to build relationships between daemon & Rhe, alicent kids, daemon n leana, rhe n harwin. Season 1 could finish with rhe n daemon marriage
Xem house of dragon miễn phí
Perfect season, all wrapped up.
Ho-hum
I am coming for you Aemond and for your vhagar
🤨 💭         Ain’t that thrilling as all of the publicity stunts, noises…       Ain’t all that STIRRING to the original GOT standards        Too many white hairs among them Black & White WTF😳, try too damn hard to compete against GOT…
Should be called pregnant thrones lol! House of the homicidal
look at us who would've thought
An epic ending to an exceptional first season. Amazing. Perfectly executed. Good job guys.
After watching the finale, this was a phenomenal series, felt like Game of Thrones in its prime. Already waiting for season 2!
I really like coming back every few weeks and watching this to see how many of the moments I recognize now, and how my understanding & emotions have changed with the unfolding of the events. My expectations for this show were not good, and I might not even watch any of the other spinoffs, but damn, this is still a fine piece of art.
Not gonna lie I thought this was going to be another trainwreck like Rings of Power but boy was I wrong. Might even say that they seem to have learned past mistakes and created something more refined.
Why are they whispering?
Was the scene at 2:24 cut? I don't recall this shot of Syrax in an episode recently.
In which episode we see the dragon that is on 2:24
Ok it has nothing from episode 9 and specially from 10  anyone else here can spot anything ?
I want to ask a question if  I did not watch game of thrones would I understand house of dragon
Why did they cut the last shot of the dragon from the series we didnt saw this dragon 2:25
Real Dragon? Hahahaha
just finished watch the 10th episode and I'm gonna miss it sooooo much :(
This series has the same fundamental problem that The Pacific had. There are no heros. Every character is dislikable!
Watching this again before finale every frame of this epic trailer makes sense and bind us to be on the edge of our seats.
Greatest Season 1 of all time   WAITING FOR EPISODE 10  Congratulations HBO for an extraordinary series ❤️❤️❤️
who came here after watching epsode 9 only to realize there spoilers of episode 10 hehhe i didnt know this trailer had the spoilers of all season
Here after the season 1 ended on a high note. Holy shite!
Make a series of andals  and fleau of valyria
2:24 whats the dragon name ?
Way better than all the seasons in Got
It got really good about the 5th episode.
cant believe the season is about to end
I do think that the first half of this season has been sort of stronger (exceptions for maybe episode 7 or 8) than the second. Let's wait for how  episode  10 ends to see if it can level up to the first half of the season
What a complete waste of time watching this series ... A) didn't even start where the last season left off & B) not one cast member is of the original Game of Thrones. Watched the first 9 episodes - and each was worse than the previous. I will NOT be coming back to GoT unless the original cast and storyline is restored. Heck even the the dragons were puny compared to the original series ... a complete waste of time, money and effort!!
OMG i just found a big spoiler about House of the dragon in the original Game of thrones Season 3 episode 4 (14min 18 sec) Rhenera killed by her own dragon !!
Waiting for the next sunday ,last episode.
What is that last dragon still not seen it?
Stopped watching this series after episode 5. Can't even stand the new Rhaenyra and Alicent Actresses. 🤢
I can’t be the only one who replayed this like 20 times
. Bran knew all the stories. Their names were like music to him. Serwyn of the Mirror Shield. Ser Ryam Redwyne. Prince Aemon the Dragonknight. The twins Ser Erryk and Ser Arryk, who had died on one another’s swords hundreds of years ago, when brother fought sister in the war the singers called the Dance of the Dragons
Looking back at this trailer, a lot of things were misleading casual fans 😂
Spoiler Alert: Rhaenyra / Strong boys will be dead in the final war (whether in season 1 or if they want to drag then last season). Aegon / all family except (Alicent - will go mad) will be killed then by Rhaenyra / Daemon kids. Daemon will be killed but will be lost after the war won by Aegon.
Down to episode 9. Scenes of dragons 3 4. Its name should have been. House of Targayren.  Way too slow..
Only disappointing in this series is the time jump of the actors just went to fast
We need a God Of War Series . Yall would make a killing
We also want to add  1 season of Aegon's conquest in HOD , because we need to see Aegon and his black dread Balerion😊
Now people are talking about why Alicent didn’t accept the marriage proposal of Haelena and Jace??  And she made a big mistake... But the actual thing is none of these would have happened if King Viserys accepted the proposal of Otto Hightower by marrying Rhaneyra and Aegon 👀👀👀
Coming back to the trailer again, before episodes 9 and 10. They've absolutely nailed it.
Game of thrones was amazing, house of dragons is more like Downton abbey, hope it gets better!
worst tv series ever game of throne was the best!! all house of dragons has is showing a dragon in ever episode n flok pregent women .worst
In Germany we say: "Verliebt"
Imagine a Spawn series with a similar budget
this show is literally saving asoiaf from the madness that was season 8 of got
season 1 is not even finished and I can't wait to watch season 2!!!!!
How many seasons in House of the Dragons ? Game of thrones
2:23 is that Balerion the Dread?
boring..............................
HBO just ruin House of the Dragon With The Cast Change. new rhaenyra bad actress
I'm so glad this show is doing so well and is getting such a warm reception from fans and critics of GOT. It's a million times better and more watchable than Rings Of Power aka wannabe The Lord Of The Rings.
It’s odd. This show is getting praise everywhere but haters flock to this trailer. Very weird. Because this is show is a masterpiece.
Lol the amount of dislikes.
Why is the music of this trailer suddenly different? Like it feels close to what it was, but it just seems odd.
this one is the most  amzing series of house of dragon i really appreciate to HBO For making this amazing series
i thought this was going to be a woke mess ... im delighted to be proved wrong .. this is is nothing short of a masterwork .. in writing plot fully fleshed out characters ... every single actor ... well almost ... its a slow start but watch it you have to get the world building under your belt ... the pay offs later are all over ... the show doesnt treat you like an idiot .. ( GLARES AT AMAZONS RINGS OF WOKE)... it simply shows you and you have to work it out .. its a joy to watch and im loving it ... anyone with post got distresss order ... forget it ... george is the writer on this and they changed things from the books for the better it works so the writer wont bail ... but my god this thing is ridiculous in the right way to make a tv show ... (point at this show) ... you listening disney and amazon
Rest in peace king viseryes
so they rushed & ruined the ending of GoT so they can release this boring piece of garbage. smfh
Dislike
The series is not worthy to be a part of "Game of Thrones".......simply poor
I guessed we all knew by now.. The Show will differ from The Book. That's logical considering history from the actual event were never actually accurate. Plot and death has changed. I just hoped with all the political scheming madness and tragedies surround the Targaryen mainly Daemon and Rhaenyra they will have genuine love for each other and no cheating between them.
2:24 syrax about to feed on vaemond
pain is realizing the trailer was better
What happened to the music!!!! To Venus in Furs cover!!!
Same issues as GoT.
I’m betting that all the haters are eating their words after episode 7
House of nothing happens
There are two kinds of trailers: those for shows that you just merely are excited about, vs. those where you actually go back to watch the trailer because the show itself blows you away.
The screen's not dark enough....  Let do a full episode in total darkness.  Brilliant LOL
The epic trailer cut
I still can't get myself to watch even a single episode: anything related to GOT just makes me want to vomit.
Am I the only one who noticed that the dragon looked like from the Hobbit movie
The movie itself have content of pornography, so to it not good at all
a 222
Well, I hope they fix their colour-grading next seasons. Why are people following the desaturated ugly and muddy look? I don't know anyone who likes it. Bring back life to your image as it was back in season 1-4 of GOT
Watched the first three episodes... Definitely satisfied🔥🔥 This series feels like closure.
.
HBO i am request you please hindi dubbed in game of thrones
The trailer is too good. The series is not. Don't expect too much.
Can anyone tell the name of this dragon 2:24
So looking at this YouTube won’t print how many dislikes. What a joke.
This prequel has far exceeded my expectations. Production is arguably even more splendid than the original GoT, though the characters are not as cunning and vicious, even if the scheming is plain to see. HoD is far more Shakespearean than GoT was. Cast performance, directing, screenplay, cinematograph and CGI are excellent, though the plots are somehow predictable. In GoT, there're always the Stark children and direwolves to root for, I'm not quite sure whom I would root for in HoD though, maybe the dragons? But there are now so many of them that I'm losing track, except Vhagar, the largest of them all. In any case, I'm so glad the original GoT theme remains, it always gives me chill and much joy listening to it.
👏👏👏🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯...✨
The power metal jams I thought of  would be an excellent fit to all the dragon scenes.  Manowar - Ride the Dragon Rhapsody - Power of the Dragonflame Symphony X - In the Dragon’s Den Dragonforce - When Dragons Rule Hammerfall - The Dragon Lies Bleeding Stratovarius - Dragons
I'm sorry but this is terrible
things went totally upside down when you watch this trailer after 7 episode...
Most of this trailer is edited poorly. The show is pretty good, though.
es el casa de el dragonos vato
Kaun kaun adipurush ka teaser dekhne k baad aya hai
Rings of power is more exciting. I personally not into HBO; His Dark Materials is the only show I like
It should come as no surprise that chews made this with all the blasphemy involved seing as they are of their father .👇 Just like their lives, the lives of the people in this series are empty, without honor, without meaning and without respect. Everything they touch is always against God.
It gets so boring from episode 6 when Milly Alcock and her friend is replaced by another character. I think I'll stop watching the remaining episode.
FIRE & BLOOD!
I agree with the comments that House of the Dragon is nowhere near Game of Thrones, a very big difference, from the plot itself, to the cast......After a couple of episodes, I have no particular interest in seeing more episodes of House of Dragon, the bizarre cast changes or replacements... just show a certain desperation to make the series interesting in completely flawed ways, with the story and content being 6/10 at best. I wouldn't particularly recommend it, it's still better than Amazon Lord of The Rings who have completely screwed everything up.
Can you please also remake season 8 so we can have a better version than the one the other idiots gave us, thanks 😊. Give us the whole story of this family, a family that would never have lost their rule to bran. Denaerys should have been queen and rebuild the family and targaeryans
Can you also please remake season 8 and give us a good ending, thanks 😊
Untill now is very booring! No action,no drama, nothing interesting 😅 oh i lie! Is a little action in 6 episodes😂 I witnessed a lot of births😅Not even close of game of thrones.
Please Hindi dubbing
Again blacks... How many can you stick them anywhere? Why wave the agenda?
Who is here after 6th episode 👍
This web series stole KGF chapter 2 dialogue from Kannada
Why did you replace the MAIN CHARACTER? Where are the DRAGONS?
I feel all episodes are going in fast forward mode we could not see the emotions of the characters like love anger vengeance as We had seen before in game of thrones. L feel like they are just completing the story.
hey guys Can anybody please tell me if i can watch it with family or not ?
GOT's Chinese version
Wow! I started yesterday with the first two episodes, and I love the show already. Once again, I have catched Westerosi fever.
Y rhaneys asking Alicent ; did you ever imagine yourself on iron throne....?
WOMAN ALWAYS,  WOMAN , WOMAN,  WOMAN, WOMAN, WOMAN, WOMAN, WOMAN, WOMAN FOREVER
"you can never imagine yourself on the iron throne " said rheanys 🤩😭
Rheanys putting alicent in her place to not even though she can ever rule the seven kingdoms 😇😇
Anybody else think that this show is way better than game of thrones?
After season 8 GOT , I can't give another chance to this madness.
can we please get back Raenyras and Allisands actors from ep1-5 (before the time skip), they were so much better and even the age gap would be no problem the new ones especially Allisand dont look that much older anyway...
Can someone that doesn't spoil anything for me tell me if it's possible the rhaenyras death happens soon It got spoiled and i think it would be better if it happens soon so I don't keep thinking about it until the third or fourth season
Can someone that doesn't spoil anything for me tell me if it's possible the rhaenyras death happens soon It got spoiled and i think it would be better if it happens soon so I don't keep thinking about it until the third or fourth season

MEGAAA!! 💥💥
Telugu
6 episodes and still no strong character by the way they should have named the episode 6 as “Push Push” 😂
what tune/song name is it?
I have to admit, the show is not badly done. I like it, at least I liked the beginning so far. And no, I don't care what the Valyrian look like either, because it's appropriately done! Unlike "The Rings of Power"! But... I have to say after 6 episodes, it's getting more and more boring! GoT was exciting and pulled you along. Here, unfortunately, nothing really pulls me along. Too much blah blah... too little action, too little tension! What I liked about GoT is completely missing here! Too bad ... after 6 episodes I expected more.
I love this show, can't wait for next episode
If i disliked but not hated GOT....should i watch this?
Who's here after episode 6 😉
How to kill Game of Thrones a second time?
What's the last dragon that shows in this trailer? Is it cannibal? It's not vhager as she was the biggest and when I watched this trailer first that's who I thought it would be, it hasn't been introduced yet, anyone know? Sunfyre maybe?
The suspense, the intrigue and the murders are the hallmark of the house, 7/10  however there is no surprise in the story, the CGI is very basic, the most criticized is the costumes and the hair design, the wigs look very fake, apart from that Between the artistic and the narrative is the same artwork in relation of old GOT series we need to see  a different history & being fair, I give a rating as a designer: 6.5/10 The house of dragon need to work more in the battles, CGI as the costume design for get more  immersion.
Rhaenyra is the true heir to the dragon throne.
I am at episode 6 and really getting bore to death. This is nowhere near to the awesomeness of the original GOT. It is just  an expensive medieval soap. So many characters that you don't know who's who. I quit.
The background music is so epic omg
You ruined the whole series with this freak. I couldn't even watch the first ep to the end. Political correctness and idiot directing complemented by bizarre and boring script.  I liked REAL Game of Thrones, but this thing is a failure.
Subscribe to HBO they deserve it
So far: boring af.
Two bad actresses for the princess, with bloated face, and boring story. Not recommendable. The "Doctor Who" distanced itself.
ugh I can’t stand alicent
I wish young rhaenyra had more screen time
1:26... the face we have been waiting for :) Let's go eppy 6 and beyond!!
those dragons look like rats crossed with chickens, that sucks.  Big. WTF
This show is so insanely boring. Can't even remember half of the names of the people in the show after two episodes.
Despite his incompatible orientation with her, I like that laenor is doing his best to be a good and supportive husband to Rhaenyra, and probably will be a good father to his “son”.
Very fascinating! When the world pushes the power of Dragons Jesus is calling out to you also asking you, do you remember me? Have you spent time with me? Do you have any hope left in me? It is when we believe in HIM that we are delivered.
Garbage show.
One of the most IDIOTIC AND INFANTILE "movies" i have ever seen. Complete TRASH!💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩NO JOKE!!!
5 houres finished during the conversation in one place. No fight, no special twist etc,  just west of time and boring! Sorry to say that, i slept duirnig the first episode.
Episode five's ending was superb. Can't wait for episode 6.
Me after looking at IMDB: Send in the flood carpet Bombers.
Adult dragons from "House of the Dragon" are disappointingly smaller than younger dragons from "Game of The Thrones"
Cool dragon
Did they change the music for the beginning of the trailer?
Aww, The Dying of the Dragons was my least favourite part of the book.    I'll still watch it though.
Why the music change?
2:16 who is she 😏
I hope to see more whor*s here.
Dislike
When the soundtracks will release?
I'm glad we have something to watch but I'm still waiting and praying for Game of Thrones season 9 😭
Umm I think it's continuing the series... But good job for the team👏
The Dream it was clearer than a memory ❗
Waste of money....
To those who read the book, are we gonna delve more to House Baratheon? They were only seen when making the fealty and also in the tourney but they werent in the wedding of Rhaenyra? I mesn House Lannister was there
People leaving negative comments are just leaving for the sake of it. I highly suspect they didnt watch the show and just went with this trailer and became fake mad.  Especially when someone said “no good actors in this show” LMAO! Outing themselves for sure
Great production and acting but the story is ridiculous and disgusting
trash
Squeezing the milk of Game of Thrones until they can. It's even embarrassing.
Why are the recent TV shows always have a gay people in there. Can you not make a TV show unless someone is gay in it? WTF
2:07
You did it HBO!  I'm so proud of you.
Trailer hits different after watching first 5 episodes.
Please Hindi dubbed Karo
I just wish there was not brutal violence in some scenes.
Great show 🔥
did you start the new season in autumn, so nobody notices that it is a dull movie?
This series is so poor I am gobsmacked so many comments says otherwise. It's boring no ones names are remembered, the dragons look poor. Why it's got such a fake high rating it's beyond me. Gordon Ramsey lookalike Mr Who dudes character is so bad. I wish I had a good comment for it I really do. GOT soundtrack needs to be removed as it appears to be piggybacking of a great series. House of the diarrhea is a more appropriate name I say.
white people's series
What about the night king ?
Shame it’s been 1 load of shite
It's not awful, but I struggle to find one character that I care about.
Who wrote this? After years of investing GoT and that season 7-8, I am a bit concerned, appreciate the help.
I love ser criston cole
Threesome series.  Pretty, boring and stretched plot.  When 5 episodes could be put into one and it would still be weak.  The rule works when the continuation is worse than the beginning.  In the heat of it, do not spoil the impression!
Now its make more sence ...after the first half ....
Who's here after watching episode 5?
I really want to know who is that last dragon 😍
I love this! Every episode gets better!
2:02 gggg
Now I will watch
I’m confused none of the original characters from game of thrones are here besides the dragon can someone explain
LOTR the new show is pure desecration 💩 in terms of political correctness and force fed "leftist" programming! Tolkien the genius WOULD BE turning in his grave 💯 and the House of Dragons show prequal to G.O.T is also sickening 🤮🤬 and even MORE twisted than the L.O.T.R new thing...where their promoting pedophilia for example!! Wtf is wrong with Hellywood!?
It is very bad 😊
at 1:42 what(who) is that? the dragon?
Here we go, who is your date for Dance of the Dragons? Mine is Toothless btw.
How is the show..I think it's been quite a few episodes now. ??..Is is worth watching or like later episodes of GOT
Four episodes, and it’s so boring that it feels time wasted. And that feeling keeps getting stronger with each episode. With the content and development, either there will be up to 5 seasons or there will only be 2. HBO hasn’t renewed many good series in past, should consider one more. Ffs  Btw, no Dragons were harmed while shooting. You know by Peta not yet crying about it 😁
The dynamic between Rhaenyra and Alicent is so dangerous.  Milly and Emily have been phenomenal, I'm genuinely going to miss watching them every week. But I am looking forward to the turn of events when Emma and Olivia take over.  I'm sure we will see Milly and Emily again soon 😭
Apparently Everyone in this series struggles with vision problems; Night, Afternoon, High Noon…..with almost NO exception each scene is lit abysmally.  In doing so each episode is a struggle to simply SEE what’s going on!  Also apparently, the Producers learned Nothing from crescendo of complaints about the genesis series.  I can hear it now’ Oh, but we want to make it REAL’.   What they have Really done, is make it a complete waste of time to watch.
I tidint like
Who changed the song ?
They changed the trailer soundtrack slightly
I have love HBO from euphoria and i will always love them
Can't wait to see the "Now They See you As you Are" Sequence. 🤫
Daenerys Targaryen is alive! Everything will be revealed in House of Dragon and then GOT continious. Mark my words!
HBO never let us dissappointed. Good job!
Soundtrack name?
Anyone know what the trailer theme is called here? I have problems finding the original form, maybe it is not out yet? It is so brilliant.
I LOVED this series!!  Our family doesn't have that streaming platform, so we just used my Uncle’s to watch it while we visited my relatives.   Truly an epic show 🎉
why tf are there so many dislikes compared to when this first came out 😭the show has been absolutely fantastic thus far
Did they just edited the trailer ?
So I read all the leaks of the season i'm-
Dragons are so well-fed!!
I believe that was Vhaegar in the desert at night.
Congratulation to 'House of the Dragon' for NOT being that Amazon show... 😂🥳
It is literally a Disney princess series, but with blood, gore and incest. Who is the audience for that?
Why they changed the music why whyyyyy
This trailer showed a lot.
Why they change the music?
We will never get over the Young Rhaenyra
I went to see the show without watching the trailers(cuz I'm a got fan), so i went in with blank mind, saw 5 episodes and finally decided to watch the trailer to see what's coming Mann i did not expect Alicent to behave like this .....omg....i can not....i was already getting annoyed cuz of what happened and now this!??? Beech took everything from Rhaenyra.....oh i absolutely hate this character....sorry not sorry
Coming back to the trailer  after watching the first 4 episodes, realizing how well the trailer has been cut.
Black targerian :DDDDDD
Is this Sunfyre? At the end?
If only they had Hagrid from Harry Potter,those dragonz would have been having milk and marmalade sandwich for dinner
We Desperately need a Dinotopia show again.
Will miss you Milly #RhaenyraTargaryen
Daemon and young Rhaenyra are the first GoT ship that gets me, Matt and Milly make me be in favor of incest and I don't even feel sorry about it, hopefully we'll see more of them in the next seasons.
I loved game of thrones, but I don’t think I’ll like this. I never liked the storyline of the queen of dragons. She was nice at first but she went mad in the last seasons. I sometimes lost interest while watching her storyline. Not to mention the characters look really annoying. Pale and white hair everywhere, it’s just boring and their faces look annoying. Especially the main actress in this show. I don’t know but it’s something about her face I can just tell I don’t like her.
🏠 of 🐉
I love that they're not spoiling the second half of the season, most of these shots are from the first five episodes
That leg looks like vhegar 🐉
I love how ironic white privilege is manifested as Dragons.
We need a tamil dubbing....
Art and Social Life by G. V. Plekhanov 1912  “The ideology of a ruling class loses its inherent value as that class ripens for doom. The art engendered by its emotional experience falls into decay."
<3
So just put ep.4 didnt watch the previous,but in 4 the soyboiiiii killed the bully….is this some woke vomit too?
The show is beyond my expectation. Breathtaking. I highly recommend it.
i genuinely cannot understand how people have been able to like this so far. Even without the context of the book, they have literally developed every single relationship and dynamic between he characters as little as possible due to the timejumps 💀
I would never watch this! Needs black dwarves!
That is the definition of poetic justice; Amazon fires the same guy that HBO uses to make House of the Dragon a hit. :) Ryan Condal got fired by Amazon and his Conan was removed because it was considered to much masculine . Ryan Condal got hired by HBO and he made House of the Dragon.  what do you think ? Poetic Justice or Irony ? :)
Wtf...if u dont have heroin than search.. Why this girl..is it nepotism.. or what? Bad acting+worst face
HI... HBO.... I'M maho Jupiter'jesus God Son 🌹 Love you Pari Son ❤️ Eagle Blood'sa
It still lies with the original concept- a game of thrones. Love itt
1:56is that Aemond Targayren?
Gonna be soooo weird for actors to switch in two eps. How big is the time skip supposed to be even?
Am I crazy or did they change the trailer music, still slaps but I swear the music sounds different to when it first released??
Only god knows how long have I waited for this
why is the Targaryen so dark?
apparently, after hundred of years, the technology never change.
They changed the music in this and made it longer or is it just me?
Иначе е тъп яко тоя сериал , даже знаеш какво ще се случи в него , поредната боза
This trailer is beautifully made
³9⅝
Think if Damean didn’t go blind he would not lose n die in the war! He was so good at war!
1:41 it's that vahgar?
Am I the only one who thinks that Daemon looks like a Super Saiyan 3?
What is the name of this soundtrack?
They exhibit a characteristic Valyrian appearance of fair skin, silver hair, and violet eyes. Why you do this? Maybe you'll be better to make serial about Martin Luther King, and role would be for Arnold Schwarzenegger?
The first game of thrones was way better I am on the  fourth episode of this one and I am not satisfied smh sorry to say u guys should focus on making one a great one for the big screen
🔥After such a HOT Summer it's great to have a look at such COOL Dragons !
Game of thrones will always be the best.. epic series ever
much much better than what i thought....
This trailer is looking epic after watching 4 episodes
I hope it would be more on adventure than the drama side.
super fun!
To be honest I don’t care anymore. That ship has sailed.
Nah, pass...
Sad af how they put Black people on the Targaryen‘s lineage is a joke
Just finished the first ep - this feels like S1-4 GoT to me. I tend to think GoT went from being masterful television to complete trash between S4 and S5.   This show (so far) feels like old GoT but even a bit more hype. They've clearly turned things around since the terrible second half GoT had. This seems to be written by intelligent adults, again, thank god.  There's definitely some 2022 fashionable sensibilities in there, which we could obviously do without, but the show seems to have enough strong points to make up for it.  I never much cared for the Targareyans and Dani was definitely my least favorite GoT character - but one episode of this show is making me realize how compelling their dynasty really is. Really looking forward to seeing this princess rise to power - she's very well cast. The girl has the look of a dragon queen about her, and I already like her way more than I ever liked Dani. She looks awe-inspiring in that final shot of the first episode in her royal garb. Very f'kn cool.   The days of GoT actually being a good show are back baby wooohooo!
trash
As long as D&D (the two responsible for the terrible ending of GoT) are never involved, and HBO keeps them as far away as possible, this show has a chance to be great.
Does anyone know the music playing in the background
FANTASTIC THX HBO!!
look on Bran Stark ftom a child he became a grown man through the years. her replacement will be a huge mistake
No comment, Historical! 🖤😍😭🙌👑
I wish Tyrion and Jon were in the series too
Lol wth is everyone putting blks in places they don't belong  FBLM yall ruining movies and shows.  Quit kissing their ashy a5535.
2:25 who else thought Mortal Kombat? Lol.
Why did they change the music?
what is the music from 0:30?
lost me. Too much mf talking. slow. fell a sleep
Never had thought I will love HOD so much. The excitement is same as it was during GOT 🙌🔥
To anybody who's reading this, I pray that whatever is hurting you or whatever you are constantly stressing about gets better. May the dark thoughts, the overthinking, and the doubt exit your mind. May clarity replace confusion. May peace and calmness fill your life. ❤Please Click My Name If You need More Of This🙏🏼
1:04 margaery....
I love this I came to the trailer to see what so many people on a  family guy video were complaining about. Just to see one black man lol 🤣 they made it sound like the whole show was black.
As unappealing as Middle Ages on a starship in space. Lord of the Rings felt more natural!
I love this show !
Moroccan Caftan is universal 😊 Look at that beautiful dress she is wearing !
I hope house targaryen and dragons return to westros by making jon snow marrying and his wife gives birth that would start the return of the targaryens
Can anyone tell me the music name?
Who all are missing the old characters
What was left from that period are 24 chromosoms, and my right of succession. I am ready jaweh....show yourself i had proven myself worthy, come and fight your brother. Sooner or later the sons of david will meet their abyss.
why did the music change? 0:52
The dragons looked so much better in the original
I'm so excited Targaryen is my favorite house, I already watch a couple episodes, it's looks sick, so happy to enter in the GOT world again
whats the name of the backround music?
This trailer looks even better now we're 3 episodes in. I honestly think this show is fantastic I hope they keep it up.
Had mixed feelings about ep 1, though the rest of the episodes have been great so far!
Geralt of Rivia's ancestors
If it's got none binary and lbgtq characters then I'll make it off my list of shows to watch. So tired of the offensive conduct being forced into every tv series!
Black targerians hahahahahah
A series for Valyria pls.
Try hard but nothing will wash away the shame of the 7th season of GoT
The young characters of Rhaenyra by Milly has impressed me so much that I’m not sure if I’d be happy to see Emma take over Milly in the later episodes
WOW what about that guy Matt Smith, what an actor denied his true acceptance of the great actor he is. So much more than Dr Who a truly magnificent actor, with consumate skills. His role in this show is nothing short of brilliant, so much so it was initially difficult to recognise the once Dr. Who actor. He shows his talent in this show however and what a talent,so far removed from his other roles and so much more in depth. A pleasure to watch and made this show an exceptional watch. Of  course the other actors in this show are also brilliant I mention Matt because this role is far removed from his Dr. Who days.
HBO you have changed the video posted on...Don’t be scared. We are here for House of the Dragon. Don’t be nervous about a fallout. Just stick with GRRM as it is his world and life’s work. And please, Filipinos watch it too. So, I hope you permit us to watch the EP 1 free on YT. Thanks!
At first when i saw the trailer , it passed all over my head , but after watching 3 episodes its making me more curious about the upcoming ep.
🙋👦
this is really good, just goes to show that you don't need to throw a billion dollars at something to create a great series. thx HBO
So Rhaenyra is never gonna  gonna  sit on the  iron throne  right 🤔
Turn out better than expected. Please remake GoT season 8, make it into season 10, give it strong story.  Justice league had snyder version, hope GoT also had a second chance.
HBO I love You!!!! you guys make my monday brighter with this seriessss!!! I love it!! Good writing, good acting, good actor, good music, good dragon, thank you guys for your hardwork, and please remake S8 GOT too... my life will be complete.
Just forget season 8 ever happened and enjoy this masterpiece. Getting that same excitement as watching early GoT all over again.
indo tumben gada
Bro what I haven't even seen this.... Time for a binge!
I would really like to see the dawn of House Targaryen, especially Aegon the Conqueror with his sisters Visenya and Rhaenys and Jaehaerys I. Targaryen.
After three episodes...boring. Worse than a soap opera, all talk.
The “now they see you as what you are” gave me chills
Did anyone noticed aemond TARGERYAN ?? The person showed with one eye is aemond TARGERYAN i think ! .
So much spoilers in one trailer.
Good work please keep the eye on the ball for all our sacks.
King has no British accent?! Shame! 😁
Hindi version nahi hai.. only English version.. it's a problem..  Hindi bhi chaheya.. English may majjah nahi ata Jo Hindi language may ata hai.. so please do it
Did anyone feel like me,that CGI of dragons in HOD is seems to be bad..GOT dragons are so good..
Watching this trailer after watching 3 episodes Now I have understood it  And lovin' it❤️
I had doubts about Matt Smith as violent character but saw ep 1 & was mesmerized... He looks amazing & perfectly fits Daemon. Rhaenyra is also amazing!
Every episode gives me goosebumps and chills. This is way better than the previous.
I haven't had the chance to start yet... So how is it so far
How can I convince my parents to let me watch this? I'm 15 and in NHS, but all my friends get to watch It 1 and 2, Euphoria, and Game of Thrones 1 and now the new 2. I miss out on conversations because I have no clue what they're talking about.
Show sucks, hard to watch
This is like the childrens version of GOT.
Cant wait for next episode of this masterpiece
the only dragon i know is dragging these nuts on the face of that queen of theirs, there can never be a female on the iron throne.
Wtf they changed the music??
The Targaryen sigil at the end of the video os wrong @HBO Max ....The dragon is supposed to have only 2 legs.. ffs!
I feel like I'm watching( GOT) all over again.
I want to see atleast a glimpse of The Wall or The North ...that would be totally nostalgic.
After this one is completed, please start the production of Blackfyre Rebellion with Daemon Blackfyre, Fireball, Bittersteel, Aegon the Unworthy and Brynden Rivers and after that Dunk and Egg Tales.
If you are here wondering if you should give this show a try after being heartbroken by game of thrones, I am here to tell you if you liked the earlier seasons of that show, you will like this. It has all the political drama and backstabbing of the earlier seasons but with the effects of the later.
라에니라 아역 캐스팅은 실패한 듯  왕좌의 게임에 비해 완성도가 좀 떨어지는 부분이 아쉽네요.
Over hyped garbage.More blah blah than anything else.
i wish shows would stop trying to appeal to feminists by making every new show about women and their rise to power i don’t have a promise with feminism it’s just getting boring and very repetitive, like superhero movies.
❌100 years before, but the costumes & custom’s are near identical  !? !?
Please dubb this series in Tamil
just watched the third episode.. i dont recommend this because its too boring and barely any actions.. only watch it if ur just into drama BS or '' talking but no action''
What happened to the other version of this trailer?
Ugly actors 🤢🤮
난 여왕을 지지한다
Add the old background music back! The new one ain't that good.
love this series secam se na dragonheart jos filmove zmajevima
Max DragOn..
Three episodes still not finding it interesting not even close to GOT
Why is there no "woke" comments on this show, and also got? Is it because women were treated horribly and they gave you "entertainment" just as you desire with their sick rape scenes?
House of the Wyvern. Dragon has 4 legs and wings, and it's 100x bigger.
Did they change the background music of trailer a bit, or is it just me
'An HBO Original Series'
House of the woke
I miss the violin instruments
Кольца лучше, красивее и сюжет лучше.
This looks kinda TRASH sorry
Game of Thrones Prequel: Golden Empire of Yi Ti, I want a full series not a cartoon  HBO !!!
Trailer SONG   VENUS FURS - VELVET UNDERGROUND
türkiyede izleyemiyoruz.
Was the kings hand trying to pimp out his daughter or was it meant to be a modest gesture?  cannot see how it would be.
was sure it was going to be bad cause the last season of GOT..but it actualy good..thumbs up to not fuc* it up ;)
Why the background music got changed?
Ok… let’s be honest, it’s good but does not even go close to the Game of thrones. I knew it wouldn’t and my expectations weren’t too high so it’s good, but I don’t care about dragons. The characters, the dialogue is what made GOT great. This just doesn’t have it.
Elisabeth Olsen joining GOT universe, whichever series it is, just make it happen,, she will surely be on scale of What Emilia Clarke did as mother of dragon,,, Olsen can probably do young Red witch.
Eminem best rapper all time
They need to fire the casting director. There is not a single actor / character that has charisma or invokes love or hate, they all have the emotional pull of plastic action figures. The original show worked because Sean Bean, Keith Harrington, Peter Dinklage, .... were so charismatic as Ned Stark, Jon Snow, Tyrion Lannister from the get go. The villains - Cersei, Joffrey, .... - were immediately despicable. And Tywin Lannister and Robert Baratheon were watchable in every scene.  The boring writing / storyline doesn't help either - GOT S01E01 started with the Night Walkers and ended with Jamie throwing innocent Bran from a window! HOD is so bland by comparison, I think most people will quickly lose interest if it doesnt pick up.
Milly did great job so far as Rhaenyra, I really wish if she could stay till the end...
Please stop showing show-runner interviews. The minute they open their mouths I start cringing.  Awfully funny getting the explanation about patriarchy from two guys. The show is good-but my feeling is your stupid virtue signaling is going to ruin it.
Wales people tale?
Caraxes Is Perfect Like It’s Rider
Name of the tune which started from 0:29....
I really scare of bad writing
Please create the prequel about the first men,children of the forest,giants alliance vs the night king!!! You butchered my boy in one episode!!!! Give us justice
Without ice the fire 🔥 is futile
I am actually surprised how many fools are in here hyping over this ... do you not remember how GoT ended ? And by "ended" I mean the last two seasons (pretty much where the series did not have the already published books as a guideline).
We are the Christian Dragon family.  I know the true story of thé Dragon.
G.O.T. has been over few years ago, and we are very dissapointed........
They replaced the video with far worse sound track.
"The house of Feminism" 🤮
2:16 Guys I don't want to make up some theories that aren't true but I think that the person in this moment is Rhaenyra being undressed by someone and by someone I mean a WOMAN. Just look at the hands!! I don't want to make any assumptions but they have been really close with Alicent and even the actresses confirmed that their chemistry on-screen was planned. I don't know and I guess we'll see what will actually happen sooner or later.
Spoilers~            The House went Extinct 😱😱
Why they chose actors who don't fit roles appearance wise! And makeup is very badly done 👎
Matt Smith looks so weird with his massive forehead and the pulled back hair I can't take it seriously  😭🤣
name of the OST?
After two episodes, I'm beginning to think the king needs a son or an heir of some sort.  I hope we hear more about this need in episode 3.  oh yeah, dragons.
Really strong start so far. Matt Smith turned my fears about him on their head in the space of one scene. All the cast is spot on actually, and from ep 1 it's got that thrones vibe where you can put any of these two characters in a room together, and sparks will fly, sometimes literally as their blades clash.  Keep it up, HBO. The story is there in Fire and Blood. All you have to do is tell it.
first game of thrones with Valerian Black and now lord of the rings. Changing the vision and story line characters with ones that don't fit them for marketing and to appease the woke culture.
so after filming with the casts and crews, where did they bring the dragons to?
It looks not like "game of thrones", its more like a "matrix" "Dr noone" etc. Why the f producers have changed its style and atmosphere??? It was very successful series, everything was good... WHY??? You fkn morans :))) all the same. Take any modern movie and it will be the same graphics, operator work, personages will be from some fkn pirates of Carribbean or other well known and recogniseable movie, but with Netflix stupidity and completely unwatchable
Modern movies are seems the same style. I don't like it at all. Fkn "Netflix" "marvel" allover. Garbage
I prefer the new trailer music to the old one. It has this tragic & sense of danger feeling  to it , which is what  the show is going to be through the seasons. The older ,though being good, was rather  very  epic and  optimistic  which doesn't truly capture  the essence of what the show is going to be all about.
How come they invested hundred of millions of dollars for this show BUT they ended up casting Matt Smith, one of the worst actor ever seen. His performance in Morbius alone should be enough to send him straight to flipping burgers at McDonalds ....
Why there is a black man???
I didn't know you could change the music like that
🔥
Not watching this pozzed trash after what they pulled with the GoT ending.
So far "Rings of Power" looking better.
asking geek out there, can I watch the series before watching all GOT series?
I'm looking forward to watching this, I'm waiting to be able to stream the whole series. tried watching The Rings Of Power, awful..
Enuff off these medieval crap. Stop!
I’m so disappointed 😔 Someone has to say it the forced diversity really is frustrating  Hope the third episode will be better
This trailer is doing it job, by getting me interested in GoT :)
Not seen it yet but is it gory, sexually explicit and contain extreme profanity like GOT? If not then I'll pass thank you very much!
1:55,  2:14 only waiting for Aemond Targeryan to ride his Vaghar.
So is it any good?
Please for the love of GOD - don’t be woke and we will watch every freaking episode
Very well familiar to GOT
From mud huts to high Valyrian? Nah...
No matter. Bran will be the king in the end.
Watch the first episode of #HouseoftheDragon for free here https://youtu.be/XrMdo8jF5Dg A new episode is streaming Sunday night on HBO Max.
Slowly paced, artistically crafted drama with a solid civil war story, takes place in an imaginary land called as Westeros with the traditions, values and morals of middle ages. It's a solid tv show and eventually it will crush down amazon's The Rings of Power.
Can't wait for that 2:16 scene & I hope it's gonna be young version of Rhaenyra with Daemon cuz I ship them so so bad ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
House of dragon will end with last dragon dying and first white Walker becoming conscious and start the game of thrones storyline of walkers.
Dracarys
I NEED MOAR!!!!!!
Are black people that turn white walkers.... Black runners?
Can't wait to be disappointed after 8 Seasons again
Please HBO maxx launch in India ,🥺
we are waiting hindi dubbing
It's all most like a bad relationship... After Game of Thrones and all the time and investment and you took me as a fan and told me, I DONT CARE ABOUT YOU.   So like a bad X here you come again, a different name same style.   So the answer is No thank you. Speaking for myself, I'm all pale white people, swords, and dragons done with. It's a hard no.
What happened to soundtrack?
been waiting for this
I have never watch a show that looks this bad - The white is to white, and the indoor scenes are almost black. Sorry - It may be 4k, but it is just terrible quality to watch
Daemon: I will speak of my brother as i wish. YOU WILL NOT
i sense.. a compelling and entertaining live action show. But i also sense... an ending so dreadful it causes the franchise to collapse, yet again.
WHY YOU CHANGE THE MUSIC IN THE TRAILER!!!!!!
Is there a way to pay to watch all 10 episodes before release date ?
John snow yok ejderhalarin anası yok😢😢
bro they changed the music
I want more dragons and dragon wars in HOTD
Woo how many people feel the goosebumps.....!
Did they change the music😭😭
Amazing Series.
After watching the first couple of episodes and understanding whats going on, this trailer looks far more epic.
മലയാളികൾ aarum ille
In United States womens are powerful men's are waste. In there tv series They always giving important to womens
The beat is so sick that i keep on coming back. 😂
Mad respect to HBO for using real dragons instead of CGI like in Game of Thrones.
Why is the main character so ugly? Like her visual is so distracting.
Is this Leftist  trash drama about Husband raping wife, women cant be King bcuz man ?
2.23  is that vhegar...? 🔥
another 8 seasons of trash
Why'd they change the music 😂
I hope there wont be a focus on the ”a women cant be on the iron throne”.  That is a conflict that is soo often representerar in movies series and soo uninterssting. And also somthing that made the politics of the original series so interesting. Because it was never about that if Daenerys as a women but as a ruler and leder and later dictator and tyrant. And there were also never a question about if she as a women could have the throne.
So it's similar to g.o.t. as here it's alicent who greedy like cirsi Lannister 😂😂
Lol. More diversity bs. You literally cannot have anything without it anymore.
Vhagar at 1:42... ?
why did they changed the soundtrack?
She’s the most beautiful girl I’ve ever seen in in love 😍
The music is different???
This is the music they should have used for the opening credits. This show is already so much different and better than Game of Thrones and the opening song should have been something that sets it apart from its predecessor.
why did they change the music?? It makes the trailer so underwhelming. The first version is so much better
Fireworks
So if I understand correctly, This show is yet about another daughter of the House Targaryen who will die in the end? Just like her descendant Daenerys in future?
Nitpick, but I feel like the makeup department dropped the ball with all the Valyrians here. Instead of looking like their hair is naturally white, they just made all the actors look old.
The last TARGYERIAN denyeras is back in action throne belongs to her.. She claims in style.. Plenty to come more
HBO PLEASE bring the Jon Snow series the fans want it #houseofthedragon
Wtf why was the trailer music changed?
just finished watching episode 1, looks great so far hope this doesn't end like got
Erling Haaland 🧐
House of Woke! 👎👎🙄🙄
I was hoping that the trailer music would be the intro music but instead they changed the trailer music.... Not cool HBO, Not Cool
So far so good!  Keep it coming!
I don't know fellas but i think game of thrones was overated too much. Yes it was a good show but back then i was feeling a littlebit bored, from the other hand House of the Dragon for some reason I can't explain it is exciting. So far so well.
Well done
They changed the music! WHY
I've read the entire novel and I've already learned the ending already....  And it's sad, it won't help me to support any character,  But I probably am still gonna watch the show like I watched the live action version of The Beauty and The Beast.  I had already heard about the tales many times since I was a child, yet I bought a ticket and watched the movie on theater and I didn't regret it.  When you watch a movie with its amazing arts & video editings, it'd make you feel like you're inside that movie.
“BECAUSE THAT IS THE ORDER OF THINGS.”
Let the party begin!!!
AHA! I thought everyone was done with Game of Thrones, disgusted by the final season, but yet this has 20M views and 20,000 comments. THE FICKLE MASSES!
Need more African characters.
Let there be Godzilla!
Why did they change the trailer?
Is the show totally based on books or there is some changes in it?
1;40 sec that balerion the black dread
Wow
The last dragon wasn't syrax ...which dragon is it ??
DRACARYS
After the first set filmed  looking for to going to Starbucks for a coffee
I liked everything except the cast   They were so boring!  I don't care what happens to any of them.  Not at all like the way I felt in GoT, where everyone intrigued me!
I think they might have prepared us for the brutality by giving us the song of house and fire first this is going to be nerve racking
Why are there black actors cast as Silver-haired Targaryens?  Is this a woke attempt?  I am not even watching the new Lord of the Rings because of this.  And before anyone becomes offended by my comment or attempts to correct me, think of this:  What if a white actor played an black African icon such as Nelson Mandela?  Or a white actor cast as Martin Luther King?  I am not against Blacks, but I at least am for accuracy of cultures and characters within a story-line.
Amooooooooo
boy this show sucks…. looks so cheap compared to GOT, and woke of course
rhaenyra and alicient bff no more
this trailer has a lot of easter eggs!!!! wow!!!!
What tf happen to the awesome music??
they changed the music in this one🤦
Would rather see a show about Maegor or Dunk and the Egg.
+
Discovery CEO, you are ruing warner bros. Do not sale batman keep it on hbo max
Am I the only behind excited to see Vhagar?!?!  He’s at present time in the story the largest living dragon left!!
They changed the music for this trailer a bit
Every time I listen/read that "J.R.R Martin approve it" I remember the last 2 seasons of Game of Thrones. He also "approved" them. 💩💩💩
If daemon and rhaeneyra get together I’m gonna scream
BRO THE PREVIOUS MUSIC WAS WAY BETTER!
I like the show
2:25 who is this , this is not vhagar
Will there be dire wolves too? I would love to see one.
I didn’t like the casting of this show.. the casting compared to GOT is really off. The main actress looks like a boy. Emilia Clarke was super pretty!
is a bit cheaper from game of thrones and decors is to much plastic and fake
The show is so amazing
I think this is for gàys..
Everything about this show is great, except the wigs. They are awful
I think Rhaenyra is main villain of this series
I'm sorry but a sequel to Game of Thrones would be more interesting to me than a prequel
The reason this is going to flop is that we all have that pesky last 3 seasons of GoT that we all know destroy the story and so a prequel that leads into that isn't going to put eyeballs on screens.
The house of the Velaryons is very ancient. Its roots go back to the Valyrians. Some of the Velaryons formed families with the Targaryens before the War of Conquest. The blood of ancient Valyria flows in their veins. They retained the characteristic Valyrian appearance - light skin, silver hair and violet eyes.
WTF blonde monke??? LOL
Is this a good show
so otto will basically be the new littlefinger
when i am queen i will create new orders💥
Is der a need to watch goat To watch house of dragons ??
Blackwashing
No matter what, this film can never be fascinating and well loved by everyone compared to Game of thrones. Game of thrones is so unique and unreplaceable. No cap
Why are all the actors so ugly?
Hmm,  not sure 2 episodes in.  Absolutely loved 'GoT' (got the dvd box sets to prove it).  'HotD'.. at the moment I'm not sure.  Don't hate,  but remember from 'GoT' the tension,  the drama.. the ability to hear a pin drop given no one watching making a noise,  as in totally captivated.. I've yet to experience that from this.  Granted its early days.. but 'GoT'  managed that out of the proverbial gate. Part of the issue,.. I've yet to invest in characters (be it those you really don't want to get wiped out,  or those you simply love to hate).
Woke bs
HBO: Here’s some characters. Please care about them now. 🙄
A new series that I will watch. Goosebumps when I watch this.
Is this a prequel or sequel?
I hope they make one series for each of Westeros' Houses. Expend the universe !
i need full offical hindi dubbed .. of ''Game of thrones`` and  ''HOUSE OF DRAGON '😊😊🥀🥀📢📢
Again Paphos the girl, will go on with important a face like the "mom dragons"  But i love Milly, and want that she is marry for me!
Please 🙏 someone tell me bgm  version please 🙏🙏
احيييه
Please release in HINDI language in india 🇮🇳
1:48 I think that's Vhagar leg
Shessh, looks like GoT Light. Cast is not as hot and shows much less skin, story is not as good, budget not as big, only thing going is the same bloody sets and dragons we seen before anyway. Pass...
It blows, incredibly predictable.  They try to surprise you with a twist but you can see it coming far in advance.  I'm done with it.
I was glad got ended. Now here comes this.
Did they butcher it. Is this canon ?
So far it has been very disappointing, and boring I hope that il will stand up in ep.3...
Seems like Doctor Who got a new journey
THE MUSIC IS EFFING ON POINT!!
gahdamn the future Rhaenyra got me excited!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It's missing something the GOT had.  GOT had some really awesome looking dragons and the one in episode one looks so uninspiring.  Still, it's pretty good so far.
Caraxes
meh, forever sullied by Dumb & Dumber
Wish it was from Netflix watching 1 episode per week is boring want a season in a day
i watched second episode. Yeah child brides horrible reality in the past, (Still horrible reality with todays pathetic ''rich'' pedos, like pizzagate)  but there is no need scene like this in screen.  At least make actor 18 years old,  it's just look awkward.  Other then this,  this show looks like just GOT clone. Like every charecter just copying got characters.   No originality and just same old different look,  got feeling.  My personal rating for this episode: 6.  Mediocre.
In a different universe we would have seen aegons conquest then this show and then game of thrones.
House of pedos
The color grading has a white ghosted tone over the whole damn thing. Like it was shot way dark and the ran a HEAVY bright filter on it. Super distracting.
Cannot wait to see Aemond!! He is awesome during the Dance of Dragons!
I hope they learn from got season 8 they really fu*ked it up No high expectations for this show
Okay but do the dragons got big floppy wieners?
Even though it’s been years, anything Got related leaves me with a bad tast in the mouth. GOT has been ruined completely for me and I don’t think I will watch this show before I hear great reviews for it’s ending.
Cool
Buckle up
CRAZY LITTLE DIAMOND 2022 🇺🇸 CRAZY LITTLE DIAMOND 2022 🇺🇸 CRAZY LITTLE DIAMOND 2022 🇺🇸 🫡🌟👺👺👺👺👺👺✝️😂😂  WE ARE THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA  WE ARE NURSES  WE ARE LAWYERS  WE ARE THE PEOPLE
Why aren't more brothers in this movie? We livingin cassles when whites were livin in caves. They whitewashed this smh
1.1 million dislikes. NICE
Doctor, how... This is not the universe we expected to see you
Everything is fine except for the disgusting English accent🤮🤮🤮
close your mouth
The first episode was EPIC!!!! So glad they decided to make this shown
I decided to watch this series even though I've never watched any of the Game of Thrones episodes before. 🤷‍♀️
1:48 i think it's the biggest of dragons
dr who wentt back in time to play in house of the dragon lol
Waiting for Jon Snow to make an appearance
did they release the soundtrack of this trailer yet?
Please PLEASE. Don't be woke trash
So forced. Cast is terrible!
The first episode was so awesome. Cannot wait for more
Inclusion forzada 😏
I’m mind blown they used real dragons wtf ! This so awesome
I love the fact that they stick with the original GoT theme. It's so iconic, I'll never get enough of it.
Disclaimer:- no dragons were harmed during  the making of this web series.
Woke.
♥️ 🔥 ❤️
When does this take place before or after GoT time
Damn, Leroy Smith lookin good here. Can't wait to watch.
I loved the first episode 🥰🥰
Imagine a warrior who also shapeshifts into a great dragon and uses sorcery? Ha.  They wont be doing that. That's too exciting.
Tamil dubbed please
Spoiler: She didn't.
It wasn't woke. Good call hbo. Matt Smith is my favorite so far
After hearing that jon snow will have a spin-off sequel in the form of a season 9 this will only make me happyer. If the show prison break has managed to come up with a new season after so many years, the best series of all time can do this too to get a redemption arc.
i smell some trash feminism
A song of Ice and fire = the union of the stark of the cold north, with the targaryen of the hot dragons ...  The producers of h.o.t.d : it's because of some folk tale Aegon seen that made him invade and unite westeros 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
surprised how many downvotes it has. Guess people were still sore about the bleh ending last time
A show about SUCCESSION
Am I the only one who thinks that syrax has horns like uncut fingernails? And that caraxes has a long neck ok but wings on the back legs? It looks like one of those ikran in avatar
Love how this show used real dragons. It just makes the experience so much better. ❤️
We are missing you John snow 💔
I really don't understand why this movie 😕 after watching Game of Thrones for years, here is another 😒 copy cat, for it... I really don't understand the why of this movie... someone please 🙏 enlighten me.
it should be epic!
I already know for a fact I will HATE Alicent. What a snake.
I'll put this up against the Rings of Prime, anytime (rhyme intended).
This show and the powerhouse HBO, unlike that Amazon bull****, showed how production, costumes, characters and the story are done.  Imagine if HBO had 1 billion for this show.
i need this sooooong ♥
is this related form GOT
Im so offended! Where is the hispanic, chinese, Venezuelan and arabic representation in these series!? They too can play Targaryans!
Im gonna watch the whole episode
Whatever they make still the got ending sucks
Maybe even the Vikings will be black.  Stop the planet.  I refuse to be tolerant of this.  Because every nation has its own history.  Make a movie once where whites will play blacks in Africa, and Asians will play Indians in America (there is no difference).  The howl will reach the sky.  Maybe it will come that you can be proud of your race without inserting it into all movies. You can throw me stones.
5/10  cast is terrible
I don't know why they don't  improve dragon sound effects
I will consider naming my future daughter Rhaenyra it sounds good but my last name sounds horrible. 😂😂
Play episodes fastly
God, I always imagined that Venus in Furs would be a great track for Westeros. Excellent work 👏👏
جاي من فودو🗿😢
suuuuuuucks...
جاي من فودو الخرا
جاي من سينمانا
lOOKS PROMISING!
I’ve watched first episode 🤦‍♂️. Matt Smith was disappointing in previous movies but now is even worst. I don’t know what HBO was thinking🤦‍♂️. Why..?!
Lmao just came here to say how many black people they would cast in ridiculous roles...wasn't disappointed...the black guy with the white hair omg rofl
Crazy how this trailer has 20M views and the episode 1 premiere had 20M views
I wasn't a fan of the original but this looks good
First ep was well done, looking forward to how it develops
Okay I realized what I think I 'm missing from the GOT era the pace. It was so deep and impactful. I hope they slow a bit and try not to pack so much into the episodes.
This was as bad as I had hoped it would not be.
Should’ve finished the original decently, idiots….
Looks just as overrated as Game of Thorns.  But tell people what to watch, and they will watch it.  Nobody will want to miss out on what everyone else is watching.
किसी ने हाउस ऑफ द ड्रेगन का हिंदी में डब कर लिया और तुम चूतियो से ज्यादा कमाएगा
So, another gore-fest from HBO?
Im not sure about this series yet. Seems to be less profound than GoT and the characters/acting are/is not amazing until now. Also, the graphics are a little bit like a computer game some times when they show cities from above or dragons. The storyline in GoT also had a slow and steady build up. This series starts with all kinds of spectecular things in the first episode. Normally thats not a good sign. However, it got me interested enough to keep watching, maybe it gets better.
Best trailer in Got universe
Missing John Snow
This is soywojaks dreams come true
damnn
Whats the point?she is eventually dying right?better give us an alternative ending instead of a prequel.
I can’t believe they used real dragons for this show.
soundtrack is superb
Watched maybe 2  hours of GOT,  only liked the dragon parts and Sansa Stark , but this actually looks quite decent.
I saw the first episode and it's damn boring as expected
They cocked up the last one,,lets see how much popcorn can be consumed whilst they bungle this one
ahahahah is there afro-targaryen? ahahahhahahahahahahhahaha
Corlis Velarion from the TV series "House of the Dragon"   "The Velarions are an ancient and proud house, in whose veins the blood of ancient Valyria flows. They retained their characteristic Valyrian appearance — light skin, silver hair and violet eyes...".  The light-skinned actor of the series.
We deserve to see Balerion powerhouse flying! Hope it could be a dream come true
I am that year of the Dragon Order of the Dracul to F  things up and do Fun things   #canrelate     (1988 )
0:51 WTF 🦍
Love how the first episode of the house of the dragon gives a middle finger to the last episode of game of throns. This was predicted to be the longest winter Westeros has ever received, a winter that is full of darkness and could potentially lead to the destruction of men. Apparently Theon was a bigger threat to Winterfell than the night king was
It's valar morghulin' time
They can hire Actors with Albino instead of wasting money on those white hair wigs and makeup.
A man who knew nothing was everything once upon a time - John snow
The great thing about this show, WE KNOW THE FAMILIES!  White hairs and all! Starks! Baratheon!
"House Velaryon is of Valyrian descent, and its members often have Valyrian features, such as silver hair, purple eyes, and pale skin." its like when they make fantasy shows based on awesome books then put it through a woke censor that just ruin its potential. kind of like splashing paint on a master peace of art.  I cant take them serious as a high quality shows. so casting directors not understand that people people have dark skin because they come from hot climates where their skin doesn't need to take in as much of the suns rays as darker colder areas where people are lighter. So unless they had advanced high speed mass trasportation systems like they do now, or wizards are teleporting southern populations north it doesn't make sense, and it should be explained in these show.
Shout out to HBO for black washing original works for the sake of woke diversity - where it makes literally no sense! But GoT/marvel fan boys will cling to this woke trash just cuz of muh consumerism.
Streaming...?
Incroyable film 🔥☺️
Music name??
Targaryen solution: marry the brother and the daughter, King Uncle and Queen Niece
is this aliexpress of thrones?
I choose this a million times over Amazon's new "LOTR" crap.
Wack
Hindi?
They can't find one blonde headed woman to play a Targaryen?  This is really getting dumb...
The dance of dragons, the civil war that marks the downfall of the Targanyen, if they do this well we could have one of the best series ever
Acclaimed actor Luke Goss must be casted...he's perfect to play any vital character in this series....especially beautifully will fit the role of Daemon...check out Luke Goss convincing character Prince Nuada in Hellboy 2 golden army....how come casting director missed out on him!
First episode did not dissapoint. The music, the characters, everything is just perfect, really nice to go back to that universum
I haven't watched HBO since Game of Thrones. I will subscribe while House of Dragons s playing and unsubscribe between seasons. These pay channels just don't have good shows anymore.
WHATS THE NAME OF THE SONG?!?!
Ypu all need to start looking at rusian series Ekatarin wood be great start
I'm excited about the entrance of the Night King.
Another useless series
i want dubbed in hindi
Hindi dabing please
It has been a ride in these games
Don't expect too much. Just like the long cold night that fell short. Your anticipation will give you heartbreak! Some say, move on! But what is that phrase?
why doesn't the author go back to the time when the Targaryens started finding dragons and how they conquered them.. and the beginning of the Night King.. the beginning of the three-eyed crow..
Do I have to watch got to watch this serie ?
Ariya estok missing
I don't think any series will ever be as good as Game of thrones but you never know.  Hoping for heaps of battles with good strategies, etc.
lots of mumbling I cant hear and dark scenes that no-one can quite see. maybe I'm just getting old and grumpy ;-) can't wait to watch!
😍
رهييب
Wow
I love how much Daemon looks like Elric of Melnibone in his black armor.
Nah
I think daemon targaryen is the coolest character in GOT universe,looking forward to new episodes 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
1.48 that is Vhagar isn't it?
I wish they filmed from very beginning First Men Vs Children Of Forest (exploration of westeros and early life of Essos ) after that Long night and making of Great Wall,Aegon's conquest,Roberts Rebellion, And the every single line written by Martin
Just finished watching the first episode and it was OG!!!
This song is hard
They better pull off a BETTER CALL SAUL prequel.
When Balrog says to the Fellowship "It's Morphin' Time" and then proceed to beat down Giga Gandalf...the whole theater cried with joy. The whole family will watch this again!
Nah
no more game of trash please.no more trash directors plz
great. both LOTR and GOT have been taken over by radical feminists. Maybe arab countries were right
Does anyone think the CGI is awful? It was so bad in the first episode especially jousting scene it was offensive. I’m not sure I can watch this
Really wanted to see belerion
Episode 1 Cinemotgraphy Superb, Clour GradingSuperb, Art & Set Design Superb, Location Superb, lekin ଷ୍ଟୋରୀ ବାଳ ଫାଣ୍ଟାଷ୍ୟ ସୀରିଶ, ଷ୍ଟୋରୀ ରେ କିଛି ଅଟା ପଟା ନାହିଁ
Episode 1👎 Boring
Cannot wait to watch the House of the Dragon series. 🐉🔥 Seems promising despite what happened with season 8 of GoT. Very excited to see it when I have a chance. 👍
I'd much rather watch 7 hours of Kanye West ranting than another second of this feminist propaganda.
its starting off well, hopefull they dont ruin this one again
I dont know why i feel like there will be nothing like GOT, never
Episode 1 was Very Good.  the Birthing part though,  that was hard to watch
Just saw the first episode and let's just say THIS IS NOT G.O.T. way too soft! More action required and stronger acting skills PLEASE!!😫😫😫
Its is really very hard ,to see your favourite character die .But sadly the story is like that only . those who know what will happen further will never be able to see the story, it will be same as fans disliked the GOT last season ending though it was not from the book , but this time ,the whole House of the dragon story script is already written , if they don't want fans not to critcize again the story , they need to bend the story differently from what is written in the books.   Mostly when some movie or TV series is adapted from  a novel  or a book ,  the Writer or producer change the ending or story in their own way for mass liking.  This way mostly work 90% time .
where is elissa ??
Feminists had to ruin it
Daemon giving me Ramsay Bolton vibes.
احب السلسلة ع شان عبود
I dunno but i think Drogon way much bigger than Ceraxes. Drogon kind of mascular dragon and Ceraxes more like skinner and faster
The frist episode is Amazing
concentrated more on the giving the messege that women are strong than developing the actual story. first episode was ok but i have a strong feeling this will be way worse than got. the charecters are in no way complex, they are either all bad or all good. damon is probably the worst charecter, he is just so childishly shallow, renera contributes nothing to the story, the king is bland and shallow also. there are no interesting charecters, not a single one. this seems like a kids story about good against evil. and all of the actors are just.... meh
ummm I am happy to be offered a logical explanation to how can Targaryans be black.
Rhaenyra gets burned and eaten alive by her own dragon!!!!
House,dragon is like Scandinavians with their blonde hair, eyes and all
When Uncle & Niece Fight its all over.....
Who else want to see white walkers again🔥🔥🔥
🤢🤮
The Word of God says, "War broke out in heaven, with Michael and his angels in combat against the dragon. The dragon and his angels fought back, but they were defeated, and they lost their place in heaven. The great dragon - the ancient serpent who is called the devil, or Satan, the deceiver of the whole world - was hurled down to earth, and his angels were cast down with him."
Okay but why tf this trailer looks so dark like DC movie?
Game of Thrones score  09/10 =   House of the Dragon score 02/10  unprofessional
i loved the first episode
Honestly if they could re-assemble the cast I'd love to see a season 6-8 do-over on the original show
House of the Budget Dragons
Palace in hindi
I dont like this actress need emila clarke
Idk this looks pretty meh.
I'm not going to lie I really loved the first episode and it's way better then game if thorns so fair I love the details im everything
Amazing first episode
Corlys Velaryon. "Token black guy" of House of the dragon.
2:23 who are those ??👀
Looking forward to this...  Won't even watch the trailer so I'll be totally surprised... BUT, I always wait until ALL episodes are dropped before beginning to watch any series.  I can't wait weeks between episodes.  I watch one a day plus iron.
From the first episode, I know who the real beast is, Prince Daemon Targaryen. Despite what the director said, Daemon is an absolute monster, kinda I hate to love him.
Tbh drogon looks cooler
Paddy,  Matt, and Rhyss knocked it out of th e Park in this episode.  Got back with a bang.
🪱
excellent first episode! looking forward to watching the rest.
Isn't this show too soon? Everything's repeat in comparison to GoT, I will say that G.R.R. Martin can't surpass J.R.R Tolkien and his work. Everything looks so fast, urban and obvious, but ok! Hm, Game of Thrones was good, but you just have to know when to stop...
Похоже на шляпу
Can't wait to see Varys's ancestor 🤣
Just now finished the 1st episode. I am as thrilled as i was when i saw first episode of GOT
Great. Another series to waste a life away.
One episode doesn't reveal anything but the first episode of Game of Thrones was very good.
its prequel for GOT i will be suggesting if u r intrested in finding out targaryn thrown of throne ,past about it then you can watch other than that i dont suggest to watch
*blacks appear on screen* Dropped.
good first ep
Alicent will be my favorite
Completely trash…….!
Wow #HouseOfDragon🏡🐉 Trailer shows that "GAME OF THRONES" is back. Acting, writing 👌
Great 1st episode. If they try to force in that LBTQWYZ agenda crap in there its cancelled forever
That moment where Miracle Max looks at Daemon and says "Have fun storming the castle!"  Literal goosebumps
meh...
Black targaryans?
I was really excited for this show as I am a die hard Game of Thrones fan. But after discovering Corlys Velaryon is played by a black actor, it made me realise the stupidity of the creators of this show and therefore, they could not have possibly created a show worth taking seriously, so I turned it off and will not watch.
Pass
The first episode was great cant wait for episode 2
I’m getting Prester John vibes 💚💛❤️🐉 return of the dragon kingdom
i feel like it will be better than got
They have completely fulfilled the DIVERSITY criterion 😂😂😂
Can i watch this series? Since, i didnt watched a single episode ot GOT. Is the story connected?
We shall see. Wise words for dating and wiser words for anything to do with GOT. Tbh, I still wish D and D could have been sued for laziness and gross incompetence. It was a shoddy end to what should have been a cinematic masterpiece.
Never seen got but this was awesome
We want hindi dobbed ,,, why are you doing this bad work ,,, please dob in Hindi 😭😭😭😭
Is this really produced from HBO, This looks more like a parody.
seems like the story of razia sultana of delhi and  his brother for the throne of delhi
Butchering the last season of GOT put me off the whole damn franchise. I watched the first episode, even the horrible child birth scene (cannot understand why people fill episode time this way), but wasn’t hooked the way I was with the first episode of GOT. We’ll see how the season progresses, but so far, I’m not impressed…
Who is Daenerys Targaryen I don’t understand anything
Is it connected to the game of thrones because I have not watched it
Here after the first episode😏
❤️❤️❤️
This woke PC series will be a flop.
So there were no blacks or brown people in the kingdom 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄bye felicia
I'm not gonna watch it before it Ends 😁 whether it took 7 or 17 years 😁, Just like Game of Thrones whole 8 seasons watched in 1 Month 😊
Just finished the first episode.  It did not disappoint.
So winters coming or not ..
GOT was GOAT ..
🧡💜🧡
Was ok, Matt Smith ruined it for me, he literally can't act. He is just like a bad Dr Who in a GoT panto. He looks, sounds like a schoolboy who got a break into showbiz with a lottery ticket. Can he even do accents? He just sounds like he does in everything he appears in. This should have been an unknown actor to make it more 'believable'. Seeing Dr Who in a wig is like watching a Ru Paul thing (crap). Trying to make the first episode of a series controversial by being overtly violent is just off too. We need to learn the characters to form a bond, not having pregnant women torn to shreds before we even know who or what they love, live, dream about. Just so rushed. Can't see this lasting as long as GoT sadly. This won't end well either.
No matter what, the cameraman always wins.....
Why the quality is poor
Looks like there is gonna be time jumps in the show
Trying to watch the premier now, it's going to be hard. It looks like it's ALL CGI, and not very good CGI. It looks like a budget show now.
Had to turn off after after 10 minutes, it's just contrived and uncaptivating.
Why is everybody so unattractive….?
Looks amazingly lame. Not to even comment on the feminist BS. Cringe.
Season 8 GOT is the worst of all!! It was rushed and the ending is not worth watching at all. Same for this HOTG, i know the ending will be devastating, waste of time! Don’t be fooled!!
Ill watch after the final season to know if its worth watching
Anyone noticed how slim these dragons look compared to Drogon and the others? Caraxes looked like an overgrown lizard and looked almost like a Chinese dragon
Background music sounds like the song Venus in Furs by Velvet Underground. That part where they sing "Shiny shiny, shiny boots of leather"
Nowadays any TV series from Hollywood are influenced by the woke culture. It is destroyed the essence of GOT!
Meh.
I would let the series finish and wat all the episodes at once...
I hope they turn this into an anthology series, featuring all the major Targaryen events: Dance of the Dragons, Blackfyre rebellion, Doom of Valyria, Aegon's Conquest and Robert's rebellion. They wouldn't even have to make a new series, this one's already named, "House of the Dragon".
I went restart my subscription on Amazon. HBO is no longer there. Bye.
Who pulls the strings at the top of the top
Should not be a throne
Only 56,000 dislikes... woke jokes are going broke buying likes now.  Salty Army we can do better.  RrrrreeeEEeeee
Throne is back🔥
Beautiful
c nul trop de bla bla pour un buffle qui vole 😴
Has there been a release for this soundtrack yet ?
It is funny that so many tv show now have race swap or forced diversity and people are often gay. So Laenor Velaryon is black and gay. quota fulfilled. Check !
Same old, same old.  Can NO ONE have an orginal idea when it comes to series and film making nowadays??
Anyone knows the song name? 0:56 :)
Another show destroyed by woke identity politics , put a black actor in a role on the show but put him in the correct role not the one he’s been put in
Just watched the first episode. What a bunch of woke trash
i really hope they're able to explore more of the eastern world!!
Why is Corlys Velaryon black? Makes zero sense besides HBO playing the diversity card again.   NO ONE CARES ffs.
Im not sure .. something looks too try hard here
Very disappointed with the first episode the dragons look like s*** and I do not like many of the people they cast I feel like they could have made this very nostalgic but I'm just not feeling it
Matt Smith with long white flowing locks is something I never knew I needed
2:17 after seeing the first episode it’s obvious that’s not caraxes so which dragon is it?
2:30 thats syrax right? not vhagar
i have hotstar but hindi dubbed please give🥺🥺🥺 sir I'm in India  please give hindi dubbed please sir I request you 🙏🙏
This is sadly leaving me cold
Now that I have watched the 1st episode, I kinda understands now (and also taking a wild guess) of what could possibly happen in the succeeding episodes.  1. Lady Alicent can POSSIBLY be the next wife of King Viserys I and also started to have interest in seeing herself having such power. She will kinda manipulate Viserys I and also noticed that she started to hate Rhaenyra? 🤷‍♀️ (again, POSSIBLY. Not saying it will 100% happen in the series, I'm just guessin')  2. Princess Rhaenyra started to take this seriously since she was announced heir in the throne and will Daemon be at her side? (another guess hahaha)  3. Princess Rhaenys seems like 100% sure that Rhaenyra will not be queen someday. Maybe because she was still hurt that Viserys was chosen before, not her. and also seeing Viserys named Rhaenyra as his heir seems like a slap in the face for her (Since no woman/Queen sat in the Iron Throne before. Only Man).  Again guys, this is basically a hunch and what I understood in the trailer, but we'll see in the next episodes.... 🐉🖤
I want All season GOT In Hindi (India)
I want All season GOT In Hindi (India)
Watching from Bangladesh 🇧🇩❤️
Who is here after watching the first episode?
Actors doesn't suited well in this characters but actors in the original games of thrones is masters💎💎
Original games of thrones is a master piece 🔥🔥but this i still had doubts
And only few minutes in and they already black washed one main character. Wonderful. I don't know why they made him have white hair. He not even Targaryen. Only by marriage. He has black grayish hair in the books.
Everything that is bad about modern TV.
why...... am i not excited? im confused.. im supposed to be excited about this...
History of incestry
This is one of the craziest and most horrifying dynastic fight I've ever read in my life, both fictional and historical
August 21: Hi  August 22: Salutations Protector of The Realm. How goes the Dragon riding?
Does anyone the soundtrack of this trailer? I love this soundtrack
The theme of Got n hod Is truly addictive.
On the one hand, I don't blame HBO one bit for moving to distance themselves from Benioff and Weiss after they singlehandedly strangled their crown jewel legacy show at the finish line. I can tell there's serious hope to redeem GoTs reputation here.  On the other, I have to wonder if this is too little too late. No one I've personally talked to has had any hope, or even excitement, for this spinoff after season 8 bungled the landing. I feel like this spinoff might be doomed to fail just from sheer residual bad taste left over.
It eminds me of the game of thrones season 8 that was written in a hurry?
I was on the fence about HOD for the longest time given that I shall never-ever forget the disgrace of GOT’s season 8. What a gigantic waste of 10 years of my life! But I’ve got to admit, HOD brought back some good memories. However, I swear by the old gods and the new, I shall never watch anything by D&D for as long as I shall live! Congrats on HOD, though! ❤️
If someone haven't watched GOT will he be able to understand this series
Fool me once, shame on you.. fool me twice…  I aint watchin this 💩
Where is the White Walker?
Hope its not as dull as it looks...?
Is it true that this is only a Limited Series??
Well, I love Paddy Considine, so for his sake at least, I hope this is brilliant. 👏👏👍
I will forever be suspicious till the very last episode..till it actually ends..hbo has a looooot to answer for
Weak trailer... also why would Prince Philip be in this movie xD
Please we don't need another D&D. Director must be protected at all cost.
Oh my God... this is disgusting...  this woke mess... a woman  cant lead but to follow... why try to make believe that is not true a thing now?
In all honesty, I’m tired of all the throne squabbles.
so pumped for this miss those GoT vibes 🐲🐲🐲
Amazing 1st Ep, My hope is Skyrocketing
hello folks, is it okay to watch this prequel series without watching GOT? I haven't watch GOT but would love to try the house of dragons, would I be missing something or would not understand bits if I haven't watch?
Excellent first episode
Episode 1 was brilliant. The magic is back.
Oh myyyyy.. pls more black ppl in these series.. plssss.. i wanna seee more black ppl.. same as new LOTR.. in 2000´s no black man.. now in silmarilion 2/3 black.. pls same here.. they need more satisfaction cos they are more burned from sun :)
Just finished the first episode! Thousand times better than got season 8. Lord hightower will remind us of tywin Lannister. Mark my words!❤️❤️
This looks neat and not gay at all.
Just watched the first episode of #HouseoftheDragon  and I am soooooo excited. #HouseOfTheDragonHBO
GOT was so good and then near the end it became awful. This first episode felt like the good days of GOT before it fell off a cliff. Clap
Already know the ending of game of thrones it was depressing
En serio nos van a dar una intro a pantalla negra …??? Si quieren les hacemos una colecta de algunos dólares …xq el capítulo genial …pero decepcionante que no tenga una intro con maquetas y música …como got
Seriously ita starts without intro house of the dragon ….a black screen and voice  ..a disappointment we deserve a begeninig a chapert like this e of GOT😳
Why Velaryon are black is far from a canon.🤦‍♂🤦‍♂🤦‍♂
1st episode and I AM DISAPPOINTED
saw it....disappointing
Pretty good first episode. What this show is missing in comparison are any of the lying, deceitful, sharp politicians like Tyrion, Varys, Littlefinger etc. So far the good people all wax righteous like Ned Stark, and the evil people declare their intentions immediately and are suspected by everyone.
Bravo!   I absolutely loved it.  And bad boy Daemon (what a fitting name), the princess Rhaenys, her potential suitor Ser Criston Cole, the costumes, even some ancestors of the Houses.    Can't wait for next week!
This show is boring!!!!! I'm sleepy. The little girl is stuck up!
Vhagar is gona be a beast
WE WUZ TARGARYEN N SHEEEIT
First episode was incredible! Definitely recommend!!!
I hope they got a trained dragon for this film from how to train your dragon movie
🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉 You did not disappoint  Let’s Goooooooooooooooo  Excellent Excellent Excellent ‼️  Thank you for bringing back Dragon Sundays  🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉
Y’all funny
HBO max kicks me out as soon as the ep starts
What a load of dragon rubbish.
oh my god okay it’s happening
I just ate a Baby Dragon for dinner...Tender and Juicy, it was delicious ; p
15 minutes until the episode! anyone else rewatching the trailer to prepare for House of the dragon ?
Woooooooah! Come 👀 about health and wellness...  flexible fasting is all you need!
No thanks.  Its gonna be a disaster like the last season of GOT
Seeing all the cuntservative crying about woke warms my heart
The party city wigs are baaaaack
Peter Dinklage was my hook to the series, without him or an equivalent it's difficult to connect
So… are we not going to talk about Doctor Who being in this?
So, where is it? Today is the 21st
Lols.. FU to HBO.. Fool me once, shame on you.. Fool me twice, shame on me.. I'll wait till the series is over to see if you (HBO) fk up the ending like you did GoT..  I have ZERO faith that you'll get it right.
I really hope the intro in episode 2 has this song
Black targaryens 🤡🤡🤡
"Game of Thrones" was primarily about a blonde white woman with dragons.  Now, "House of the Dragon" is about a blonde white woman with dragons.   Wow, that's creative.
Wonder if the show's going to be constantly going on about feminist stuff or if that's just the trailers...
흑인이 왠말이냐  몰입도 떨어짐 ㅅㅂ
Are there any black dragons too? Or they all are just green?
first episode was great!
Hopefully the dragons were treated humanely
قطعة سينمائية عظيمة .. بانتظاركم ♥️
I prefer the cast or the real game of thrones they looked better on screen than the cast of house dragon, house dragon casts all look bland and unremarkable.  I am a huge fan of GOT because the cast had face that were captivating and remarkable on screen.  I will not commit to watching house dragon.
This is going to be Doctor Who's longest arc...
These Libs just don't get it. They saw everything that went wrong with the last seasons of GOT with the Woke feminist plot. How most of the fans hated it and the "mother of dragons" centered plot. Yet they double down on these plot lines as the basis for a new show
Game of wokes
Corlys Velaryon black? Wtf... dear HBO, where was the diversity when you cast the dotrakis? Who are clearly describe as central asian in the book? I guess diversity isn't for everybody...
I must say, I cried for and hated last season of GOT but this looks promising.. I am still mad for my queen
The comment section shows just how gullible people are... "omg game of thrones was ruined but I consume anything that's given to me so I hope this product is better"
Oh wow! After the failure of game of thrones, now we get feminist game of thrones... oh boy I cant wait to never watch this garbage.
wow they used helmes!
KILL them dragons! Daenyris did not deliver on her promises! She make a bigger wheel, even after she was down to ONE dragon!
i watched first episode.  it's watchable.  But there is no interesting charecter.  Game of thrones become succesful because many hidden stars also make this happen. Like Varys, Baelish, Tyrion, Faceless man, Cercei, Jamie, The hound, Aria, Jon Snow..  This is just first episode of course, maybe they develop many charecters.  My personal rating for first episode: 10/7.  Not great not bad.
Who's the last dragon?
Hbo max released episode 1 early,i saw it first aemma the queen dies in ep one hahah
Bangladeshi people attandance👍
Just watched it. Just as good as got. I'm sold already. So pleased it wasn't a fk up
At least they made the Targaryens actually look inbred this time.
Can someone pls give me hbo account 😕
روعه
The lack of even a line of High Valyrian is dissapointing!
I'm so excited. I'm from Dragon Country in New Jersey
The dragons look like 1960's clay stop motion. :') And the characters are just as flat.
Sorry I would love to watch this but I don’t want to be disappointed 10 years from now
"Sorry, HBO MAX isn't available in your region yet"  this world is pitiful,😓 thanks anyway
wow...  sooo diversity
Everyone talking about how good this looks and I'm legit waiting for the CW logo to pop up
Winter is coming 😁😁😁😁
Ya wala show india ka ander hindi mai kab tak ayga??😐😐
I really hate that they started with the middle of the story, when I first heard about the house of the dragon I thought it will be from the day they left Valyria, I would love to see the story from the beginning not from the middle of the story. I think they should have start the story with Aegon Targaryen (Aegon The conqueror).
Now who came to delete your comment after watching episode 1 😂😂
yaas queeen
Nyc
"From the beginning, you know the end."
I smell a woke fest coming
Wooo
Looks boring...
I see Matt smith I click
I can't wait to see the season get hacked and all the episodes released at once
Putting a blonde wig on a black guy is silly.  Forcing diversity where it’s not required.
Season 02 release date??🙏
Hope D and D don't ruin this as well!
A wee bit slow to start with, a few ramblings for the storyline but other than that it's 172 years prior to the Game of Thrones. Hoping episode 2 is more flowing/seamless  than episode 1. But as they say you can't beat Game of Thrones...
روعة.. 😍🔥 لكن هل يوجد في اليوتيوب ام لا؟ وهل يوجد  مترجم... ــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــ؟
Iam watching for this series 😘❤️❤️❤️ Let's be able to stand with GØT
Ramin djawadi he's a genius in music 👏
Slyrak and terrorblade are acting in this series . They are pretty good actors .
No jon snow
mega cheap
I don't care we know the future this looks amazing. We know the future of the tudors, wars of the roses, William the conqueror etc etc, yet we still read and learn!
I love how almost everyone is just having fun with the graphics and the possible plot of this show. If this had a different audience, this comment section would be filled with idiots complaining that showrunners are making GoT woke for making a woman be a protagonist 💀💀💀
“An HBO” doesn’t make grammatical sense.
❤️❤️❤️❤️
C'mon they F' up the Cast! I was waiting for someone more beautiful than Emilia Clarke, they casted Milly Alcock ! In what world Milly fit in House of Dragons ?????????? I'm very disappointed!!!
They literally made 70% of the  trailer out of episode 1.
Holyyy smoke!!! That background score 🔥🔥🔥 Ramin Djawadi 🙌🏻
Farzi hai
Load of crap, so unrealistic and childish, good for a 12 year old or someone with the same brain development.
I can't stop watching this rn!!❤️‍🔥💊
Damnnn!😍❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
🤐
Waiting Hindi
nice one
nice news
😍
❤️❤️
Looks really good. Too much pressure on the cast tho
As always pushing feminism and women being better leaders and queens and ruining the serie
Hoping to hear some masterpiece from Ramin Djawadi. Again!
We need old characters
Olivia 'bout to get Cooked!
Nice
I didn't see any problem with CGI!  They were good
Straight trash. HBO decided to stick an "HBO" logo watermark on the episodes and it never fades away. It's there the entire time. Annoying as f*ck and just a bad idea overall.
Nice trailer
When a Targaryen is born, the gods toss a coin and the world holds its breath
Not interested this time. It took me 1 year to forget how badly you ended GOT.
Release in hindi official dubbing in india
does aquaman get to ride flying dolphins next to the dragons
Hope they will not ruin this like game of thrones
The only reason I signed up for HBO Max was the animation, so I have no reason to continue my subscription. Cancelled.
This looks a lot better than Amazon's "Rings of Power" trailers...
Rip Danny 😭 😔 🙏 ❤️
Summer is coming.
if the trailer song is not the intro theme ill be sad
Amanhã estreia aqui no Brasil. Show!!!
Great. I was looking for another show to talk about how bad men are.
The 'Reign of the Dragon' is almost upon us! And so too in Crypto there is a new Dragon    $TSUKA    created by Ryoshi the legend behind $SHIB which made thousands of millionaires. Secure your bag of $TSUKA, this dragon is getting ready to FLY!
Woke of games. I'll pass thanks.
why is there no asian targaryen
Honestly I will watch the show cause there aren't any other shows to watch at the moment but I expect based on all trailers the series to be mediocore at best. Everyone says the cinematography is stunning but I don't like it. It's like it has a grey filter in all scenes. Like it has Bloom effect. Also the trailers seem to suggest the show will be a soap opera based on a fantasy world and game of thrones was more than that
I'm not investing my time until i know how it ends. Not letting GoT do that to me twice.
Game of Thrones' first spinoff series, House of the Dragon, is finally here. But don't expect to see any familiar faces. The show is set 172 years before the birth of Daenerys Targaryen and the events of Game of Thrones, the adaptation of George R.R. Martin's fantasy series A Song of Ice and Fire.
I Shall Wait With Baited Breath...
Tanto les cuesta hacer una serie sólo con gente blanca y sin negros
Black Targarians? I mean... but why? There are plenty of Black kings and queens from Sothos.  And they have Basilisks and Wyvers on that continent. Could be pretty badass to do a show about them.
Anyone else notice the score is a Velvet Underground song?
Please don't f*CK it up this time...
Wait so who's the bad guy? Is it the uncle, or the niece?
Blond dreadlocks... Now I have seen everything. Yeah, not watching this dung.
I’m ridiculously excited for this show but one small detail I’ve picked up on is Daemon (Matt Smith) appears to have lost his left eye, whereas in fire and blood it is Aemond, son of Rhynaera who loses his eye. I could be wrong in this as I’m a bit rubbish with names but I’m interested to see what other changes are made subtle or otherwise.
Good gracious. I CAN wait. A  looooooong time actually.
I still don't understand why they can't make their eyes purple like they're supposed to be.
No dragons are harmed during filming
Watching the trailer has I wait for the premiere
Tomorrow is realeas date
عظيم 📜🪶
Yo just a thought but I think his son might be the white walker king just saying 🤔
An entire house made black. These diversity quotas in TV series hurt the writing and more importantly the suspension of disbelief.
Not gonna fix my pain in the last couple years. I want daenerys back
I Seriously Cant WAIT For This to finally Air, years in the making and 3 years since this series finally ended, AND it seems like the Story and acting is already better than Season 8's horrible mess. Cant Wait for the Dragon Scenes Tho!!!!!
Best success is Namaz,,,who agree me,,,?
I hope this is as addicting as Game of Thrones. So far it looks 🔥🔥🔥
Spoiler: D&D will write the last season and the finale is Danaerys waking up and telling Jon Snow she had a weird dream....
Not my Khaleesi
It's going to be woke garbage. I'm out.
is it comes in Hindi?
Looks pretty boring tbh. Think I will pass.
Its all Hype.  Its going to dissappoint and FAIL.  They will give it a Femi***t/Woke twist. So its definitely going to be a dud
As always...... One of the best BGM ever .....Just like GOT..... Request you to release these BGMs separately....
the north is way more interesting c'mon no one wanna see bunch of white hair people fighting
I just finished the original show a week before the spin off excited to see this on Sunday and I’m excited for Last of us
November 13th.  King of the Mountain.
I'm dying to watch it
Paddy Considine is in this he plays Viserys. He’s an incredible actor. I implore you to check out his earlier work and the movie Dead Man’s Shoes. You will not be disappointed. I watched GOT and like many was pretty let down by the end and but just knowing he’s in this, I’m immediately down.
Stupid SJW panderfest. It'll blow.
Let's not forget to appreciate the background music.
looks gay
Are people dumb enough to fall for more Hollywood money grabbing?  *Yes.*
I love Olivia Cooke. And I'm so excited to see her in this
They have a token Black guy in the show. it fits all criteria!
All Vanilla cast again🤦🏾‍♀️
I can't believe it's actually here. From what I understand tho... We're getting the perspective of two separate timelines. Same characters young and old. I really hope that doesn't take away from the show
👀
After the final season of Game Of Thrones, I won't watch or read anything to do with Westeros ever again.
IMPEACH 46
🏠🐉
very very exited <3
This is Game of Thrones reincarnation 🤩🥰🥰🥰
Whaouuuu !!!!!!!
It Is Difficult That It Can Be A Hit 💔
Heroine is ugly 🤮
Hope they dont f*ck this up like the last one.
So will miyagi do close forever¿
Dragon animation looks pretty bad compare to game of thrones
...very good
you still dare to show your face around after that ending by Dumb & Dumber?
شوكت يتم عرضة
The cast lack quality
a black targaryen........yeah, ill pass on this trash.
Sadly this won't be available to a new viewers, because it is not part of internet provider services which should come as a standard TV streaming package.
Should have re-filmed the last couple of GoT seasons before starting prequel tbh. That last season in particular left such a bad taste in the mouth that I don't want to watch anything GoT related ever again.
مبين مسلسل مال نسوان
Venus in Furs in the background🥰
Can't wait for mary sue to jump on the big evil and just kill them lul
졸작으로 만들지말구 진지하게 만들어라
ahh man Balerion won't be alive during House of the Dragon because he passed away under Jaehaerys, the king who reigned before Viserys, and the show starts under Viserys. 😭 #theblackdread
GOT : WINTER IS COMING HOD: SUMMER IS COMING 😂😂😂
Corlys Velaryon is white, stop with u woke politics
Dragon moments  1:43 2:13 2:17 0:32 1:01 1:34 1:56 2:22 2:28
Where is Jon snow
daemon and caraxes is badass
BOTS and paid poster working overtime in the comments, like always. But no way to tell if its worth watching or not. Is is just another agenda only feminist woke mess or can they actually create something different. Tis the little gurls going to tell big strong actual warriors how to act and what to do again? Are weak wahmen going to fight in battle and be on top like in most of the boring junk they make, including the last few seasons of GOT. Not entertainment, that is agenda driven scripts by Hollyweird telling everyone how to think and act. Have to wait and see I reckon. I know the new CEO of the HBO/Discovery merger doesn't want any part of that type of programming and really mad they spend the money on this show, after ruining the GOT.
Ever since I watched Game of Thrones, I can't enjoy any TV show. It was perfect.  I'm looking forward to House of the Dragon 🔥🔥🔥 Dracarysssss 🔥🔥🔥❤️
I don’t understand how some people are legit bitter over the last season of GoT to give them a very biased distaste for anything related to GoT after that. 7 seasons vs 1 bad season doesn’t make that 1 season the forever determiner of the show’s quality now. I hated the Harry Potter and the Halfblood Prince movie yet I was still excited to see the Deathly Hallows and the prequels with the Fantastic Beasts series.  This trailer looks amazing. The budget looks extremely high. The costume and design is so realistic. Don’t be downers.
I miss the music from original series though 😭
I really hope we get to see some melons 🤞🏽
Im glad they brought back miguel, tho some thing annoys me: I find two actors to look out of place (dont like their costumes and hair etc) and I think it would be better if they skipped the whole woman cant be queen things! It’s overused and hopefully they wont make it into the main thing. (Btw I like that there are queens, nothing agains women lol)
To put blacks in a
black Targaryens fo sho homie.
Succession- Game of Thrones
Okay everything is fine but where is john snow and and mother of dragons ?this season will not make it worth unless and until it has those two characters in it .
Please stay true to the lore, please be well directed and written and please don't get too politically correct like a lot of shows nowadays! I want this to feel like Game of Thrones.
Hindi dubbed
Another 8 seasonsssss
🔥
ok, i am sold! this looks good!
we don't want to see wat has happened, we wanna see what's going to happen, what happened to the Queen of dragons.
Better be good 😂
Looks Great ....
Do I need to watch GOT to watch this show?
Why daenerys is black¿
I'm here for Aegon i'm a bit disappointed at first but the trailer is really amazing
The hype is real!
🔥
I hope eventually they show the blackfyre rebellion
#dragonsarecomingforyou
i hope we could see the Blackfyre Rebellion  arc 🙏🙏🙏
the music really gets to you🔥 omg the hype⚡⚡
This remake is Good but ..I like old Game of thrones Web series....
This series would mean so much more if Season 8 ended with Daenerys Targaryen on the Iron Throne
omgggg
They are actually overgrown wyverns, not Dragons
Nope!!
Also how about hbo just go fix got season 8
Wtf is the doctor doing here
I am excited to see opening music
Wow...Daenerys was really the best looking Targaryen...
The medieval version of Venus In Furs by The Velvet Undergroud gave the final blow.
Nope, nope,,, just nope. If they were going to make a prequel, they should have made it about the original Night King and his Corpse Queen. Have fun consuming Hollywood rewrites people.
This just looked like a regurgitated cast and plot of a show we've all already watched...
So they are gonna ruin daenerys uniqueness with this monstrosity.
hope to see Roberts Rebellion in coming seasons...and other major events...
Can't wait
Hahahha this looks terrible
Is the premier just 1 episode or 3 episodes every week?
I'm sorry but what is the point of anything anymore in this universe?  They should have made season 8 non canon or rebooted at the very least.  Easily the biggest let down in television history.  Enjoy the prequel and all the ways it'll be connected to absolute garbage
Lol, I didn't know that Martin wrote about black people with white hair. It looks ridiculous. The fact that you put your political agenda everywhere is so pathetic and moronic. I won't pay for that circus to see.
It actually looks kind of decent!
I can’t wait!!
🤢🤢
Как сказал бы великий мыслитеть Папучелло "АААА НЕГРЫЫ"
Can't wait to se the books that this is supposed to take from get tossed out the window
Is this another version of GOT
Best thing about this show is that I have just now read the book. Now I can be a smartass to my friends about it. Trailer looks pretty promising, only problem in terms of following the source material is that Otto Hightower seems to be on Rhaenyra's side.
Jesus ,HBO is not manipulation correct sorry political, why are so many white  actors playing?Look at the new lord of the rings,only orcs are white. Never mind .I wish I could see a movie about Dracula with a black dude ...or transgender
Türkiye'de hangi platformda yayımlanacak bilgisi olan var mı
I'm getting vibes to the early days of Game of Thrones from this, and I'm so here for it.
MAN Do I want to see Daemon vs Aemond!!
Where are they..?
It’s gonna be hard for me to have to wait a week for each episode 😂
If u think wisely viserys is the culprit here.
velaryons being black is biologycally impossible  so lets say that aegons mother was black¿ that would made aegon black too its applies to many other marriages the targaryen had with velaryons making it a complete disrespect and insult to the lore
Why are there black people with blond hair among Targaryens??? Why?
What is the name of this theme, where can I find it?
had to go woke, didnt it
Woke garbage
OMG!!!! I am so excited, I feel like a kid in candy!!! 08/21/2022 I'm so ready!!
Never before I have experienced such a death of the community. This looks so woke, so brave,  yet so useless and unwanted. I see many positive comments being copupasted in this section,  not a clever move.
4 to go
more girl power? that still sells?
الحماس 🔥🔥🔥
Drakaris!
FLY DRAGON IN ARE WORLD
Already looking forward to see Daemon vs Aemond battle!

1:48 Balerion???
I heard HBO is planning to have one of the dragons come out as a transexual, can anyone confirm?
Let me guess they put the black dude in there for their woke inclusiveness bs, when he doesn’t fit into the story at all. Not going to watch this crap.
Matt Smith looks exactly like the original ghost busters ghost villain in this. That alone may ruin any chance I had at enjoying this show.
Yayyy I'm excited they better bring it let's GO!!!❤😊
hbo max kill la kill season 3
Amazing Trailer. Cannot wait for this show to drop!
If it was anything like the last season of the game of thrones hard pass
i miss the North ❄️
Looks awful
After the last season of game of thrones "Nope, nope, nope not going to watch the prequel, they did us dirty"  Watches the trailer "Okay you got me you b*stards, I'm in!"
house of the dragon season 1 release countdown (check on YouTube)
Honestly I don't really care for GOT since  the last few seasons gave a bad taste in my mouth. Yet if HBO max cancels Doom Patrol, then I'm canceling my subscription instantly.  HBO max since they merged with discovery have stopped premier movies from coming to the platform and have axed great shows. Just leave Doom patrol and peacemaker and I'll be a loyal member
It's so awesome when Girl Knights beat up men 5 times their size and strength! It just seems so authentic, especially when they say something snazzy before they kill them! I hope there is just tons of that!!!
Shiny shiny, shiny boots of leather
I'm the King. I'm the Lion Throne. I'm the Purple Dragon. I transcend King and Queen. I'm the King of Kings. I bring the Golden Age. I'm freeing you from a prison you don't even know you're in.
It’s coming so soon oh my god
I hope the story line is good and not some woke BS
I’m really the Trailer lover & I can say, that part from 0:35 - 1:21 is one of the greatest & most epic part in trailers history! Epic music
🍿
they're Targaryens why don't they just marry the two and be over it.
How do you not release a 4K trailer?
copy and search and you will enjoy it "A Powerful Billionaire Disguised As Homeless In Order To Discover True Love"

I was hoping for game of thrones title track
It's sad - the level of disrespect to viewers in this movie... Another bs secondary hand pure commercial s....t. Lines so empty of meaning, not fresh, so off date, forced fake heroism that we heard thousand times before. Shame to still keep filming and feeding people such dust. Fantasy from USA is done. Waste of time.
It's not counties story. It is new one
Waiting to see if it's true that the show is woke before I pay.
I already know the full story line. “The dance of Dragons” they all die in a war of dragons trying to win a war between a girl or boy. The war is used by dragons. Ending is the dragons get killed by people saying they are demons causing trouble. I heard about it on the History and Lores on Game of Thrones and the books
I hope that D and D won’t ruin this one like they ruined Game of Thrones finals 2 seasons 🤦‍♂️. I was so committed to Game of Thrones until I saw how they ended and ruined it all cause they liked Star Wars more
I'm not one of those people who forgot about half of the shows on Netflix and think that the finale of Game of Thrones was one of the worst ever. It was definitely mediocre in my opinion though.  But I'd be dumb to not watch this after enjoying several years of peak TV. A show that at its best, was possibly as good as some of the greatest shows of all time like Mad Men and Breaking Bad.
Huge shoe to fill Incredibly excited
Hope the black dude is black in the books or at least a new character. It’s not right to cast a black dude to play and established white character for the sake of it
5 more days!!! Who’s with me here
Please, can someone explain to me the house of the dragon, is it the story before GOT or is it the continuation of this series.
Imagine if the dude just waited to name is successor until he had bloody son's lmao 😆😆 none of this would have went down 🤣🤣 the targaryens gots to be the dumbest bunch in all the 7 kingdoms
Imagine we get to see one of the Targaryen to ride dragon to The Wall nd  beyond just for a ride(or to check the night's watch) ... It would be totally nostalgic nd amazing 🔥
Ok I'm in,👍
There is so many viewers can't watch because of it's not dubbed.
houseofthedragoncoin Welcome!
2:02, 2:20 Nice to see Aemond who will be the one to have the last badass fight with Daemon till their end. In the show, he has an eye patch.
House of the SJWs
I hope you guys have made it like the first 7 seasons.
I wonder if we will see the mad king. Also, is it already out for eng people?
I've repeated this more than 30 times it's still amazing ❤
Rings of Powers vs House of the Dragon. Which will be better?
Looks horrible, more Hollywood gas lighting. You had a good show but decided to rush the ending because Covid was coming. HBO sucks. If you don't like it you can eat my tinfoil hat...
I think the show has run its course. I don't see anything new here. Sorry.
Thank you HBOMAX!!!  God I hope this prequel takes place in the time of Balerion "the black dread"  :-D
If only 3 seasons 🤬😡
🍿
I guess I have to watch it to understand why a dragon is introduced. Am I missing something?
House of the Albino spoiled brats. No thanks, even if it's good. The ending is ruined. Let the bottom of the barrel GOT fans who are still left enjoy it if they can, but even if it is good.. Like we need more woke white ppl/brats in modern media. The Targaryen's are the least family I care about in GOT.  Thou I have to admit it's funny that the dragons are just basically white privilege manifested.  Anyway, let the mindless SJW idiots enjoy it.
Still not over Rip Daenerys Targaryan
Amazing cast for now
Why aren’t there any trans dragons??
Looks like libtard cringe. People wanted aegons conquest
🖤🖤
🖤🖤
🖤🖤
Any rainbow dragons
My least favorite house. I wish the series was about House Stark.
Looks at least a trillion times better than new lord of the rings remake trailer even with all girl empowerment crap even though original was about everyone's expectation that Daenerys will prevail for a better part of the series till she went mad
Let’s hope they don’t butcher the ending 😬 too soon 🫢🤷🏼‍♂️🤣😂🤣😂
damnn im so happy to see balerion , we just saw his bone before , so exxciiteddd
We need to know where's Daenerys body
Time to rewrite history again...:(
ACTRESS SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE SAME OF GOT MAIN
Very looking forward to this
This is woke
This should of came out before game of thrones lol
HBO is doing a good job of almost obscuring the main factions in this war with their red herrings. This looks like it’s gonna be fantastic
Oh no! No way you are going to fool me again with an improvised and patched up final. I won't spend my time following and watching  for years  to just be disrespected at the end. No way Jose!
HARD PASS. Game of thrones ended horribly. Over this franchise.
Everyone knows in the end Lannister will destroy the house of dragon
D&D are not working on this or anything like that right???
Another woke pos show literally misandrist too what a joke this society has become
The music 😍😍😍
This is gonna be as good as Eragon movie 🫤
After GOT worst ending ... nobody wants to see this....
These bad writers need to leave Martins world alone.
cringe
Still bitter about GOT
How did they manage to get such a non attractive cast after got
കാത്തിരിപ്പിന്റെ പൈൻ ഇല്ലേ, അതൊരു സുഖാ  ❤❤❤❤❤
Do you know what the realm is? It's the thousand blades of Aegon's enemies, a story we agree to tell each other over and over until we forget that it's a lie!!!
Cringe, skip and pirate,
Mallus assemble ⚡
Ain't no blacks in house targaryen
Really hope it's good
Damn Dr. Who, what happened to “not killing people”?
Hmm based on this I have a feeling they didn’t do a well job with casting. They all look so.. fake-ly blonde.   And of course they had to add black people for inclusivity, but in the books, they are.. like super pale, almost albino people with purple eyes. Why force inclusivity.  I dunno, just doesn’t feel right.
The got/hotd composer is so good, I hope the title music is as good as got. Even after watching it a few times through I still don't skip the into music very often. Wonder if the music in this trailer is from the intro or something different. In any case I'm sure it'll be great. Btw I'm glad we wont have to wait 3-4 seasons for dragons this time.
So yall just forgot the last season huh?
Pozdrawiam WK💪
Surprised we didn't get a "Dracarys!" line at the end
LMAO
How much they want for a dragon?
ONE MORE WEEK TILL THE DRAGONS DANCE!!!
Imagine being hyped for this garbage knowing how it all ends
my hype is skyrocketing!🚀🚀🌙
Well trying to complete GOT asap before HOD is released 🤣
Succession meets GOT
Balerion in the flesh, what could be more wonderful than that?
My expectations are rock bottom after the end of the last show, but the visuals here are unlike anything I’ve seen in any TV show before, so my hopes are high
Chaos is a ladder
Hindi dubbing release please karo 🙏
How many times do they wanna say iron throne in 3 minutes 🤣
women women women women women everywhere everytime it's always man - bad womennnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn, i hate that everything has become woke
I just want to know why the colors are waxy and dull, they hurt my eyes, and I don't see any detail
I don't think so it can beat game of thrones 😈
Why john snow is not shown in this Series?
I need you to win this challenge 10subs in 30mins please😱😱😱
One more week till we see Westeros again
HAIL TARGARYEN
الحماس عندي 🔝⬆️⬆️⬆️
HOOKED UP by this trailer already! Now HBO better not, I repeat you guys better not F this up like you did with the previous franchise 🙏🙏🙏 Hail House Targaryen (Shouting aloud *FIRE AND BLOOD*) Also I'm so hoping they will show us how they developed ties with the North in there times of turmoil even after being the powerful nation themselves.
GoD I’m super excited 😜
Looks good.
Can't wait 😍😍 so excited for this
I hope in the end of the story they won't make the same mistakes like the last episode of the Game of Thrones.
ZMM on the ASX. 99.2% down. Huge investment opportunity?
The great council of Harrenhall will feature as the cold open of the season/series  Battle of the Stepstones in episode 3  Laena’s death in childbirth episode 6  Laenor’s death in episode 7  Aemond loses his eye and claims Vhagar episode 7  Viserys died end of episode 8  Battle at Storm’s End in episode 10  Final scene of the season: Daemon tells Rhaenyra that Luke is dead
Who was the idiot that did the casting for Corlys Velaryon?
where is the whitewalker?
If travis fimmel is in this serie it would be the best in history
Is this game of thrones from wish ?
Need a better looking Khalesi ngl
Im still waaay too salty about how dirty you played us die hard GOT fans with season 8. You left major questions and plot lines unresolved. Not to mention it all felt rushed. Not going through that again.
I think it will tell about the throne fights between rhaenyra, the daughter of viserys, who became king after king jaeherys, and his next sons. Note: The first relative killer is in this period. Most dragons are during this period. It is the first time anyone outside of the Targaryen household becomes a dragon rider.dragons will fight .and it will be very exciting.
Eagerly waiting....  Advanced love from Bangladesh 🥰
As long as D&D have nothing to do with this everything is ok
of course women and black people most important thing in 2022
Thank God D&D have no part in this.
Oh wow, a blonde haired targaryen wants to be queen of the seven  kingdoms and to sit on the iron throne. We've never seen that before
Hmmm
Me desperately waiting for the intro music.. 🎶

maaaannnnn!!!! this is sooo lit!
To put blacks in a medieval european drama is preposterous.
When this is actually looking better and more enjoyable to watch than amazons lord of the rings
Remember game of thrones last season? Don't give HBO the chance to break your heart again.
Where is the game of thrones full season in hindi . Please hbo
Actors' main talents are their commercial sexual orientation and gender definition. The cinematographer is dead. And Game of Thrones too.
"choose your plan” I choose violence.... I mean torrents :D  FU hbo
8 days left 🔥
BGM is haunting
ഞാഞ്ഞയി
That drums are epic
THE MILKS GONE BAD….
Get ready for another horrible poorly written last season of game of thrones!
Again...why is there a black guy with silvery straight blonde hair?
Does travil fimmel "ragnar lothbrok" play a role in the serie?
There should be little finger ancestors the middle finger, that'd make this series more interesting to watch!😑 Btw I am so excited for this show hopefully it'd match the level of GOT or even better!
Omg. This trailer has 18M views so far!!
What about the walkers in this?
This is Balerion 1:48 ? 😶
Matt Smith ist everything i need
Why director didn't release series in Hindi Dubbed because many people's in India also fan of got I think not at list 5% ammount to dub in hindi but target audience is more than 5% so you don't waste your money to dub in hindi..
Bad,so disrespectful with the source material
Feeling like a whole new game of thrones cant wait
The trailer looks fantastically pathetic
good
Is this sequel or prequel??
To put blacks in a medieval european drama is preposterous.
Fire will reign
Who love this like me 🐉🎖🏅🥇🫡
New Acters Perfect also
After GOT, this is will be new hype in tv shows industry 🫡
9 days left! 🔥🔥
They spent all this money and time making anew GOT when all they had to do is fix what they ruined.   The fans would have given them a pass this one time but no.   HBO is right the fans are wrong.    This will flop hard like Rings of Power and what story you had to tell will be completely dead
2:25 😪
HBO owes us from the catastrophic disaster season 7 and 8 of GOT was
I am shocked and appalled HBO would ask us to invest in another GOT series after how dirty they did us last time…
This will be insanely good!! Can't wait!!
Looks awesome.
I'd give anything to hear "the night is dark and full of terrors" from the Red witch 😭😭😭
is it sequel or prequel?
maybe if I took the brain out of my head I might be able to watch this crap
I’m so excited !!!! Please hurry up 😂
Damn....this show is going to mop the floor with Amazon's Rings of Power......HBOMAX for the win, at the end we the viewers win. Not a fan of woke culture, but at least the black characters here seem to hold their ground.
She is my queen?
Targaryens will rise with their dragons but the lion lies in waiting for the moment to strike.   - Tywin Lannister
the witcher or wtf?
Who’s the blonde black guy? Woke bs already took me out of this. I’ll just watch GOT again and again and again.
I hope John R. R. Martin will be the first decision maker in this series so that it doesn't happen like in Game of Thrones
Idk if it's the trailer that's just bad but the plot seems weak. Anyone here who has read this already and can attest to the depth (of character development), the draw and/or intrigue of the plot?
Dragons are the reason I'll give it a go. I hope they show how the dragons are devoted to their mother(will  they
i miss hoddor
They used stunt dragons for those shots
There BETTER be some damned one-handed swords!⚔️
Looks terrible. in game of thrones they were able to cherry pick the best parts of fire and ice and leave out the garbage. Writing a new story will not be so easy. And if this trailer is the most compelling bits. Oh yeah it will be aweful.
Ah yes, black targaryens...
Y el africano que hace ahí?
I only watch this, because i love Dragons and want to see them. #^ . ^# 💜So happy that the creators done such a great job on animating them.
I really really hope this is good. Got really broke my heart, i used to rewatch the whole thing every year but after season 7 it was kinda meh. Then season 8 dropped and now it’s just pointless to re watch it because there’s the impending doom of awfulness on the horizon
Oh no she can't be queen because the Evil men will never accept it 😒
i’ve watched GOT so many times i won’t even need a refresher lol, super pumped for this!!!!!
Need hbo max worldwide
Girls gonna squirt on this serie again...
Bad
after previous disappointment there's zero hope ill watch this
Will be interesting to see how this will compete with The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
PURE WOKE GARBAGE full of spite and misandry!!
One thing pleases me - after this series fails, others will think several times before shoving their stoned agenda in the face of the viewer and before calling all those who disagree racists or sexists. How did these femmes and other non-binary rabble get pulled up.🤮
Nah.
GAME OF THRONES ON FREAKING DRAGON STEROIDSSSSSS!  THE HYPE IS UNBELIEVABLY REAL.
I dont care, got is dead to me.
Games of woke
Strong women, bad white men, good black men. Fantasy 2022.
Now the Valerians are black? More woke race replacement casting....I'm gonna sit this one out
Oh ffs, another oppressed woman story? I'll pass on this woke bs thx
Looks soooooo baaaaad
Game of Woke.  No thanks.
Garbage
I cant wait. Wow!!!!
I just read its going to be woke trash, sorry, I cant subject myself to wokeisms of any kind
Hopefully they used real writers
Dracarys 👑🐉
ZMM on the ASX. 99% down. Huge investment opportunity?
LETS GOOO!!! I’m ready HBO this was one of my favorite stories from the books 📕
You know it’s gonna be good when there’s a trailer for the Official Trailer
Am I the only one that thinks that in 01:48 it might be a flashback of Viserys and Balerion? I really hope I’m right and we get a glimpse of Balerion in the show
another series-film  pretending that 5 foot 100lbs 20 y olds can rule the world...
Dear lord, is that Paddy Considine? I’ve loved him since Dead Man’s Shoes
I prefer the previous Game of thrones dragon design
Que pesadez de serie...
So will there be great dialogues in this one like in season 1 of GoT or will it be retarded pointless boring babbling like in the last 2 seasons?
I swear, Hunter Schafer would’ve been an amazing Targaryen
Matthew 7:5 James 2:20  The House of The Dragon(s). And Or The House of Dragon(s). There cannot just be one dragon?!?! Is this an origin story and or the death  possible end of a species. Where do the  Dragons come from?!?! Where are the other  dragons?!?!? Does this Dragon just wanna live  on its own but there is a Community of Dragons  Somewhere else? Is there also the possibility of Dragon Family Tree Somewhere else. Other then at the Dragons house And or back at the Dragons Origins within their community. Like  Power is Power is the Dragon at war; too?!?!? Best, X. Inn Jesus Name, Amen.

Do I have to watch game of thrones before this
Please tell me that insane massive dragons foot is balerions it has to be
Lol what a garbage dragon design. Drogon and his brothers look far superior to this crap
This dragon design is crap. They should have made these dragons like Drogon. It would have been far better
I am just counting the days till this comes out
Remember when its all said and done, Bran is still on the throne. Pass

“It was very important for Miguel and I to create a show that was not another bunch of white people on the screen.”
Way too many white people. Definitely not going to download this for free. Reeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!
Wow Waiting For It... Its On Hotstar Naa Waiting To See Tyrion Lannister Hope So ...
It’s amazing in 2022 that people are excited for a show about inbred white colonizers (who believe their bloodline is superior) fighting over a pokey chair. Lololol so brave and stunning.
A woman would not inherit the iron throne. Yeah i guess we had that already :D
which tv show do you think will be better? The house of dragons vs The rings of power? Are you going to watch them both??
African American with white hair, what is it?  Is the show director out of his mind?  except for insanity and focusing on the syndrome of sexual minorities, there is nothing in the new series.  I won't even look.  I don't want to ruin my Game of Thrones experience.
Please dub all sessions of GOT in Himdi
To put blacks in a medieval european drama is preposterous.
Just happened to finish GOT  last month and then I found out that this beast was coming out next month! talk about lucky timing. Can't wait to watch this
Why is a random member of the family black?
I love the ost of this trailer..reminds me of The Witcher...and it does give a feel you it. It's like 1000 better than Amazon's garbage the Ring of Woke Power
☹️HBO MAX not in india
I bet this show will start off so great and strong good luck to those who will watch. I will wait how many years it takes till the season finale 😂😂 to watch, I am still traumatized from GOT
Anyone else notice that the music sounds almost exactly like Venus in Furs by The Velvet Underground?
Why can’t they just tell the tale of them conquer Westeros?
Is Ned stark going to included in this series ? Would like to see his backstory also
Loved Game of Thrones! This however looks like a desperate cash grab. Won’t even bother with this.
Right off the bat I don’t see any strong female characters I can connect with like we all did with Emilia Clarke, Sophie turner, Lena headly, Natalie dormer, Maisie Williams, Gwendaline.  The list goes on and on in GOT but I see like one or two characters like that in this trailer so far. Hopefully I’m wrong about that
Here's a tip, keep an eye out for the young underdog who gets an early disability and they end up ruling the world. Nice custom dragons this time around
You see Amazon this is how you do it!!
It's current-day Hollywood. It will be Woke. Hollywood can no longer handle source material. All IP becomes a platform for ideology.
the last dragon will back and take avengers
Hopefully they hired different writers than the ones who worked on GOT Season 8.
Man, I have such an insane crush on Olivia Cooke. This show seems to only make that crush more intense lol
As long as Benioff and Weiss aren't anywhere near it and they have source material from Martin's book, this has a chance.
Black Valyrians? HAH! What "woke", Marixst Garbage! PASS and denounced. (Censor bot comment deletetion incoming)
please be good.
daemon is so hot
Sbscbx to cy dhanmel plwesa
Its great to see that after Game of Thrones destroyed itself in the last two seasons that this will reclaim that as destroying itself before anyone even watched it.  What a load of trash.
I CAN'T WAIT!  DIVERSE AND INCLUSIVE WITH A WHOLE LOTTA GIRL POWER.  TO BE FAIR, THEY EXPLAIN WHY THE DRAGONS WENT EXTINCT... THEY WERE GAY.
This looks so good compared to the season 8 of GOT
How about winds of winter? :?
Why can you use original sound effects? On Spotify I got an ad for this show and half of the ‘dragon' sounds were T. rex roars from Jurassic park! Pathetic, get some original roars up ya
OMG. The part where Aragorn says: I have decided to name a new Doctor. And Lo Pan says: But, I'm the Doctor. And Spock says: Who? Classic!
To put blacks in a medieval european drama is preposterous.
Could someone with a better knowledge of the lore please explain something for me? My friends and family were all impressed by this trailer, as was I, but from the way its presented we all came to the obvious conclusion Matt Smith is rivaling Emma D'Arcy to be the heir. And that is the war. It's even implied he's favoured by some because he's a man.  Now I've looked it up in the lore and Matt Smith's character is actually married to Rhaenyra and is a supporter of her claim. So where is the opposing faction in this trailer? It seems deliberately misleading for some reason.
Looks good but no doubt it will have a 'message' and will therefore be crap.
Not interested in the message.
The king slayer should be with them
I'm cringing so hard from this.
I have just completed the whole series of game of thrones..... And every one who has ever watched the series knows the feeling when the story finally end  I feel kind of sad because i wanted to watch more So i searched on Google if there is a seql....and guess what there is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
what do the Dragons identify as ? so viewers don't misidentify them ? ya know ... 🤣🤣🤣
More woke garbage, HBO how about making a good story with good characters without bringing political western shite into the mix. It's no wonder ppl are turned off by the crap. All I see here is another show going down the pan.
We need hindi version
Nops not gona watch it for sure
Please make got 9 session
#Porodica zna se, Ne bira se #Familija na okupu ispred svega Boriš se za nju srčano sitno (bit po bit) A ne samo na galamu krupno mega,bitno

Looks good to me
Rhaenyra looks so Gorgeous yet so vulnerable at the same time Can’t wait to see how she brings her role across to her audience 😊
How much woke garbage are we gonna be fed this time?
nice so we can finally see rhaenyra get eaten by Sunfyre the dragon :)
Yeah I don't think know........ I still am expecting some n..ds
Something somewhere seems a little sus... I smell some woke shite?  hope im wrong.

Theres a fly in the soup.. the albino.
Too many Geralt of Rivias in the same TVShow? isnt it?
This is what Eragon could’ve been 🥲
I don't know what filter they're applying, but Milly Alcock's face looks like they digitally aged the baby fron Twilight.
Amazon, start taking notes, this is how you make a series...not that awful trash you call the Rings of Power
I’m excited and all but why go back so far in time..why couldn’t u go back maybe 50-60 years ago and show the fall and betrayal of the king not the entire family. Could of given us familiar faces we know and could of related to but idk that’s just me
spoiler - it ends with Brandon Stark being King and all Targaryeans dead
I AM HERE FOR IT!!! AH yes.
Will I be able to watch in HBO GO? Please help
Looks terrible
Do you have to have watched GoT to enjoy this? This looks cool but I don’t know if I wanna commit to watching GoT
0:48 wtf is that 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
well at least this looks beter than ring of power so
New characters sux
To put blacks in a medieval european drama is so preposterous.
Lets hope they dont feck it up like the last season of game of thrones and run out of money meaning sorry crew we have to hurry up, throw half the script away and cut half the story out and rush it.
Tell me why I feel this maybe better then Game of Thrones (2011)!! This is will be interesting plus these graphics are amazing for 2022 cinematography 💖💖
I hope Dr who gets killed pretty quick, man annoys me, I don't know why.
Please HBO, Do a Roberts Rebellion or Aegon’s Conquest maybe Blackfyre Rebellion.
Who’s hyped to see Balerion on screen
The top comments look like they’re made by people hired to compliment the show.
Please Hindi is released for India
Can't wait to distribute this across Nigeria. Unique!
This looks so much better than Rings of Power and it's comming from a massive Tolkien fan. I hope that whole show will be as awsome as this trailer. Fingers crossed!
Damn  Vaghar🔥😍
Drinking game: Take a shot every time someone says "Iron Throne"
All those bad wigs bother me.
I mean it’s called the house of dragon, not the game of the thrones. We’re just getting a re skin GoT, it be nice if they dabbled into the history of the Targaryens
Woke of the Dragon?
I think adult rhaenyra looks like carol from twd
Another rushed show
Really great job from HBO, I loved the show so much I hope the ending makes more sense than Game of Thrones
Prequels are boring. What would be interesting is jumping ahead 100 years after GoT. We already know the Targaryens lose power and all the Dragons die out for a while.
Waiting🇩🇪
We want hindi dubbed of GOT
I paid $1000 for those who can DEEP FAKE black Valyrian to their original Pale skin as the lore should be.
bring back rome instead dumbazz
whats with the black dude with blonde and white dreadlocks lmao
Too woke. Not watching.
Building off the last season of got, and going full woke, I'm not getting excited.
Wow peep how caraxes looks like Smaug from the hobbit
...fool me twice, shame on me.
Loved the cover of Venus in Furs in this
The soundtrack already sounds so good
So someone took the vocal melody of "Venus in Furs", played it on violins, and scored a seriously promising prequel trailer. So damn cool.
You know it's a winner when an epic rendition of "Venus in Furs"  by Velvet Underground is the trailer score. Hyped.
Matt smith only apears on the cast list for the first two episodes :0
Lord of the rings for me is totally out, this series is my NEW HOPE
The world needs more dragons in media
Without white walkers game of thrones is nothing
Black Targaryans with white dreadlocks? Oh this show is going to be good! 😂
"House of Velaryon" was described as a race of pale white skinned people, with violet eyes and white blonde hair. HBO made sure to undo all that whiteness.
Disgusting ANTI-WHITE propaganda.
D & D has nothing to do with this right? That's the only thing giving me a glimmer of hope.
Another show blacked by Hollywood executives smh. Gotta get those diversity points at the expense of the story....
Where are the whitewalkers?
Just finished game of thrones, can’t wait for this series
This time they are fighting sexism. Stunning and brave.
Just make sure to wait for George RR Martin to complete the plot first this time.
Better call saul did well. Come ok HBO we know you can
Me: Eh, not really fussed about House of the Dragon.  Morbius: (Shows the glorious Matt Smith dance.)  Me: On second thoughts, it might be worth a watch.
Game of Tokeism - Rise of Wokeness. This is going to be awful and cost HBO a ton of money
Waiting in Hindi India
I wanted see Balerion so bad
one more show for good women and bad system??? pass...
Looks every not like GOT … sad .. the actors looks …. BAD
What even is this?
Now I have understood Why is Smaug has been so bad)
If Balerion doesn't make an appearance it's a 0/10
If its got the writing talent of season 1-4 and doesn’t cave into woke bs, this show will be the best of all time
Why didn't they show the white Dothraki? This is some kind of racism!!!!😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬
Ummm why are their summer islander Targaryens???
Ready‼️
Dont tell ur making black Targaryen pls
Can't wait to see Aemond One Eye with Vhaegar vs Daemon and Caraxes atop Harrenhal and the God's Eye!!!!!
Does anyone else watch this and still feel like we're waiting a different ending to GoT?
1:48
HBO the new netflix?
Who wants to bet this will still be bad even without D&Ds input?
Such an amazing app still 3.6 rating on playstore?
Imagine the cw dc shows with this kind of budget
looks lame, hard pass
Оооо, 11 доктор)))
Looks like diversity and inclusion. Black Targaryen makes absolutely no sense. I'll pass
The 5 second condensed version of the trailer that plays before a trailer is engineered evil
hm
[Kernel;redsn0w] A!!!!+++++!!!!A
Most of them die.
Great bgm😍
CAN.NOT.WAIT ❤️
The casting sucks, and that CGI though 🤮🤢
Why does it have to be about gender politics ffs.
Shouldn’t the Throne not exist yet in that time.
Gonna flop
Are paid YouTube comments massively common now? because there is no way this live action universe has a shred of credibility, a fan base, any intrigue after D/D trashed any hope of a legacy.
This is Epic!  I could already smell smokes from _Dance of the Dragons_ ! 👸🏼🐉🤴🏼
there are 4 bots attacking everyone who laugh on them
哇～。来了来了。hbo牛逼
A Androgynous playing the little girl?
Why did they habe to put black people, ruins the whole thing
I wonder why they choose unattractive actors for this one ? GOT had pleasant looking main characters ...was it deliberate ?
Who asked for this?
💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Will come in India ?
My expectation from this was story of Aegon the conqueror. What we got is another game of thrones but less intense. The previous one already left a bitter taste in my mouth.
Main Youtuber hoon mere channel se apka entertainment hoga ayansh yadav official
All the actors seem unremarkable and not memorable people they seem like background characters cast in main character roles, they don't have the "It factor" the original GOT cast had.
Hasn't GOT destroyed their loyal fan base enough?
i read the original GoT trilogy while i was locked up in the feds 2003-2006... we ALL read it. The books were brutal yet honest and amazing. Now i just hope an equivilent talent attempts the Revelation Space trilogy.
“A bit like Tatyana except you can’t pay extra for a more satisfying conclusion” - Critical Drinker describing GoT season 8
A black targaryan and a quote of "woman cant bebking hurr durr"..... I hope to god this is the only wokeness to come out of this show I was a huge fan of got and fire and blood was one of the first books i ever purchased on my own for leisure.
Where is Emily Clark  And Kit Harrington?
As long as they don't GoT Season 4 and 5 it.
The music SUCKS!
This is better than the rings of power.
Better cast than the Justin Bibs Look alike at the rings of power.
Ngl it is mid asf, ratio + the boys better 🤓🤓🤓
Feel Matt Smith is going to crush it in this series
Trash CGI, mid show, not gonna watch🤓🤓🤓
Yes yes  hope the people or person get this..just like to say well done.i was looking forward to see another grest film  and now its here am  so so so happy..wish i was in this film..
Struggle to take it seriously after how bad the last season of GOT was
And what am I excited for now? I have already seen the entire show with this trailer.
I have no faith in this prequel... Dragons and Targaryen were the least interesting part of the GOT for me...So am I gonna watch it? F**k yeah I gonna watch it!!! I just hope we are gonna see the Stark ancestors playing a role in this new show. They were my favorites. No hate for my comment, I just love the Starks.
I know this is stupid, but I just can’t get over how weird Daemon Targaryen’s actor looks. He is just a weird looking dude. Not exactly ugly—just weird looking. It’s like watching Steve Buschemi playing a dashing, roguish prince.
Lets hope the final episode will be on point.
You do know they will destroy the story like they did in game of thrones  they get board and end it quickly cutting out off the story think ill give it a miss and stick with the book
I think the previous dragons looked more beautiful and realistic
I can't wait to watch the season 1
Please dubbing Hindi many people heart this series in India 🙏
Is it R rated series..?? I would love to watch r rated series...😍
Охуеть!
Screaming crying 😭😭😭😭 man please release all seasons together please 😭
Man idk
We light the way
Loved the trailer, but is it just me or shouldn’t the dragons be a bit more colorful? I know we haven’t seen all of them, so maybe there will be more with color.  Caraxes is supposed to be red. Sunfyre is supposed to be golden and striking. All I’m seeing is a varied color on them in the trailer. GRRM explained them as amazingly colorful.
Black or green team?? 😂
The music was really nice
GO WOKE GO BROKE
SPOILER WARNING . . . . . . . I really want to see the massacre lucarys valeyrion and see vhagar fight his little dragon that would be soooo dope
I really want to see aemon in action and I hope they did what the book did with his eye 👁
🥐
Oh yeah
Kıyamet bu gündür Ey Ümmeti Muhammed
Why does everyone have white hair.. Even the blacks 🤦🤦
Im so Hyped for this!
If Matt Smith wasn’t in it I wouldn’t even check out the first episode, but who knows, maybe this will be phenomenal, I just really, really doubt it.
Looks very lame
I mean..we all know how it ends...
I love how uptight everyone is in these shows
War is a foot
After the GOT debacle. I'll save my time for  other things. Thanks. *This has 50k Dislikes. That's 25% - at present. Not very encouraging. Im always confused when I see Black actors (with white dreds, no less) playing English Lords or knights. It never works. I get that it's fantasy, but some effort should be made to maintain some level of  historical verisimilitude.
House of Wokeness. How about a King of Dragons? Enough of this girl power.
Is there any chance they can throw one of them giant monkeys I've heard about in the jungle in the Far East
I think it’s foolish to expect this show to beat peak game of thrones. But It would be even more foolish to think this show will be as trash as the end of GOT. We have unknown actors, who are looking to prove themselves. And unlike GOT, this story is finished and written. Anyone can read the books and will know how this show plays out. But this is good, because the show runners cannot ruin the show by a hanging the story, now they will simply follow the narrative that the legendary George RR Martin wrote.
Who is the black dude 🤷🏾‍♂️
Cannot wait 🔥
I say this once and I say it again, GOT is only good for the books
Can't wait watching game of thrones now yes I'm late but just realized how good it is
You tricked me once, shame on you. You tricked me twice, shame on me. This is nothing but a cash grab. LOL moments: 0:48, 0:51, 2:49, 1:04, 1:31, 1:53. So much bad acting (among other things), and they have the illusion that they are going to save this with the flying dragons. Not a single actor in this trailer is a much for any of their counterparts in GOT. HBO will be equally incapable to deliver this as J. R. R. Martin to finish his books.
HBO didn’t want another white fest so they added black characters with blonde hair smh
I love the whole cast already.. Looks amazing
Any one else excited for entry of balerion? that paw at 1:48 seems to be balerion's
I was super interested in this until I saw that it is all about the most boring thing from GOT “no man will allow a woman on the throne”. My eyes could not stop rolling. Making the show about that will save me money though, I won’t be getting a subscription to HBO for that crap.  The show does look visually good but that doesn’t mean the storyline will be interesting.
They shouldve brought back and made the original Dario actor the heir
Although I didn’t see a lot of magic in this preview I hope they throw some more in👀
Why would we watch this after they butchered the main show purely because they wanted to cut it short
No hound, no thanks
music please at :  0:57
I’m so excited
Can't wait for Rhaenyra souffle
Can they make these dragons bigger like Godzilla?
FTF негр таргариан
0:48
Spolier: U know how sad it was when Viserion and Rhaegal died. Well from the 17 dragons alive at the beggining , all of them will perish, with maybe max 4 of them surviving. Prepare your tear wipes.
Game of thrones Best Webseries
Will it release in Hindi language also?  If not then please release it in Hindi language also because we are also eagerly waiting for it.
la femme rouge a 400 ans  l'histoire se deroule juste 300 ans avant...
The BGM 😴
Y don't they just get a dragon to buuuuurn down Manhattan, and just get it over with        Y Don't U
I hope those dragons have reduced CO2, NOX, and sulfur emissions otherwise I'm gonna protest.
I really liked Daenerys, not for her character but mostly because of her goal. But I very well knew she wasn’t fit anymore for the throne when she lost Missandei. Jon killing her still has an effect on me 💀
Yes! More fight over throne,more dragons, more BLOOD AND FIRE!
That's breathtaking..
1:34 Epic Bgm starts from here
Little velvet underground influence
Please don’t let me down. Please.
Ive read some of the reviews for this... They ain't good... Gone is the violence the sexual content the nudity the bad language.... It's about 2 women vying for power amongst a load of idiot men according to one source I read... It's totally anti everything that made the original series so good
Whitest show on earth.
looks very interesting, let's hope they do the story justice
Funny that the doctor plays the bad guy 🤣
HAHAHA TARGARIAN BLACK AND LATINO 🤣🤣🤣 BORING
I am on fire 🔥
I can smell the stench of wokism and misandry. 2 seasons to last at most.
D&D looks better then GoT.  I always thought the Targaryans were the worst part of GoT.
The casting contradicts deeply the source material and what grrm wrote
I cant even say in words how freaking stoked and hyped I am for this.. Game of Thrones was my love, and this will be my second love. 😍
Dub in Hindi because this play is very popular in India. Please
kinda lame im sorry but I need a male role for this idk ”king” fits better for this in my opinion.
Game of thrones is the highest IMDb Rating Web Series In The World !! 🤟💯
I'm calling it from now; there will be an overload of gay scenes, alot of male nudity but minimal to no female nudity (because that's sexist), emphasis on diversity and inclusion over excellent story telling, the majority of the males will have cro magnon level intellect while the females will be Einstein level and be better fighters & leaders (of course). I am going to be an extremely wealthy man at the end of this season when I bet my life savings on these check marks.
Looks good. Too bad we all know how it will end.
Dubbed in Hindi
Boring
They really put King Ezekiel here? Well,jokes apart,wtf is that? Come on,pc culture is even here,so sad and stupid
A black Velaryon? 🙄
I just want to know how did Dorne resist
I remain skeptical about this.
Woke Quota checks out. Progressives will permit you to play this.
🔥🔥🔥
1:45 ufff  ⚡
GOT cast was much more better .. 🥲
It's movie or series 😀🙄🤔🤔🤔
We want haund John snow 🌨️
I want a same show of house Starks with different wolves
the girl who play alicent literally lived around the corner from me 🙂
And this one has an ending :0 can’t wait to see what HBO are gonna do with this 😄
Waiting is hard.
There's a lot of whispering. Like is anybody here able to talk in something louder than a monotone?
This looks insane
Bring it on!
Властелину Колец полная жопа, дом Дракона размажет их по стенке
Ugly actors. What a waste.
Will we see Milo dance again?
Pass
Just paid for hbo max to rewatch game of thrones for the 3rd time in preparation for this series, I have high hopes and I'm really excited
Whoa can't wait for House Hightower characters, they're my fave house in Westeros.
Whem will Mirtha Legrand appear?
Looks better than Rings of Power.
IM EXITED FOR THE NEXT EPISODE BUT IT HASN'T EVEN COME OUT YET
Had to ruin it with the casting 😒
Is this going to be a series or a movie?
Am I the only one that hears Velvet Undergrounds 'Venus in Furs' in that music?
To think Baelor breakspear was bashed because he had dornish appearance and not the traditional Targaryen looks and now you make black valyrians out of nowhere lol  Good luck with the strong boys storyline, its going to be hard explaining this mess
Worthless woke garbage. It even looks atrocious.
got s9
wow
" I hope Ramin does the music" and " The dragons look so unique" and all these other fake comments just repeat over and over. I scroll down and see the same comments, then I click on the people saying them, and their channels are completely fake. lmao
Blacks FTW
The image of the Mother of the Dragon is still fresh in my mind
Any one  notixed dragon vfx  is not up to mark
WAMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEN!!!!!!
Shiny, shiny
Very very excited!! Will hbo max like my comment
Black washed one important family just to appeal to woke trash. This story is based on medieval War of the Roses in England. Helloooo,  its white history and in the novel they are white
Finally
Where is the Hindi trailer?
It looks woke af to be honest
what a wonder ful trailer🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
I have to laugh at all the people years and years ago who said Daenerys was a lesser character and wouldn't be important in the end. And here we are, an entire new series born in her honour lol
very excited
Bro now that I've seen it I can't unseen it didn't know Prince Phillip was in this show sheesh I thought man was old but not that old.
Re do S8 then you have the right to make more content off this franchise.
looks cheap
It looks more like a Parody of GOT. 👎
Very Excited.
Seems like we’re gonna get a a good depiction of Otto Hightower’s manipulation of Viserys that led him to undermine Daemon and eventually exile him. The books always hinted at his role in the conflict and left it to readers to piece the clues together. Gettin a more first hand view of his schemes will be dope.  As a 2nd son of a noble house, having your daughter become queen has to be one of the most ambitious glow ups ever achieved in the 7 Kingdoms lol. Seein him and Daemon’s beef w/ each other is gonna be epic
Now focus on remaking S08
I will see
This is epic 😍🔥
Calling it now. This will flop.
Looks good but all I can see is Doctor Who playing medieval games
OMG I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL AUGUST 21ST TO START WATCHING THIS!!!
knockoff Daenerys Targaryen is going to win the thrown in the end there is no point in watching it.
BGM name？
Let me guess, the trailer looks masculine, action driven but all that is nothing more than bait and switch -White men are evil (because of “Patriarchy) -Black men are dumb or comic  relief (black Taygarians because “diversity”) - Women are intelligent and. if “only this toxic men who built civilization step aside so women could take over)  Basically the same woke bull crap written by two Beta-SJW morons who are so bad that would make GOT season 8 look like a masterpiece
I don't see any Asians... Where are the Asians? Where are the Asians with dark skin? And not a single gay man in the trailer... who's going to watch this?
Norbert has gone big
Man these shows, they're ahead of their time. They set the standards so high in all aspects. When I watch shows of this kind, it feels like substandard.
Can't wait to watch HBO is brilliant
I'll watch the first episode, if it's 1 bit woke I'm not going to bother continuing. This ott wokeness is in every TV show going is beyond ridiculous at this stage
This looks horrendous. Another woke piece of garbage that’ll flop.
For me to merely say, "I can't wait", feels like I'm not  honestly expressing myself.   But, yeah....I CAIN'T WAIT!! (Wringing my hands impatiently) 😏😏
I can't wait any longer 💔👁️
Fire and blood 🔥🔥🔥
wtf black targaryen
Why are there so many Poc actors? Why can’t us whites have anything?
Trash.
I don't know how I feel about this to be honest.
This is insane,why is there a black guy¿
Can't wait for this:)
Sick Dragon armor! HBO showing Amazon how to make a fantasy series!
bildiğin smaug bu a.q
Amazon Prime L
Huh, is that "Venus in Furs?"
From how the people making this are talking online, I'm guessing this will be as good as the last season of GoT...
Ok everyone is Aug 1st the count down begins... 😅😄😁😃😀
Meh
Black Targaryens??? Is that a joke?
seems to be rhaenrya vs daemon, in ice & fire werent they allies vs aemon and the hightowers?
All fake comments on here, its just woke crap, no one wanted some dogshit version of G.O.T, where women fight, behave its cringe
Looks boring
Here we go again, the male characters will be inferior to woman....it just gets old
I am hoping for the best but I don't trust show writers any longer.
Do not  forgot to release in Hindi
Targarians always pay their debt why is a b guy in it?
Black Actors with white dreadlocks you gotta be kidding...lmao. No save spaces from leftist ideologys. Is this some kind of wheelchair race with amazon and netflix about who makes the wokest trash show???
Hopefully this is a hit. 🔥🔥
I'm so excited!! 😁🐲🐲🐉 How many seasons are we anticipating this time?
GoT finale ruined it for me
Another TV Show ruined by wokeness, first was Witcher, next is amazon LotR and now this. Shame
Super BG. I saw this dozen times just for it.
Looks like crap.
No high hopes considering how bad the last three seasons of Game of Thrones were..
I'm not investing anymore time into GOT until the sixth book drops (if that ever happens).
11
Now this was a trailer making me excited and want to watch it 🤩 Complete opposite from TRoP trailer, who was the biggest disappointed of the century 😩
Maybe I have a color blindness special, because characters from many classic works have simply changed color.🤔
This show looks great. And I am expecting it to be great.
💙💙💙💙🤍🤍🤍🤍
1:27 look how the swords are folded over the stairs, how they line the room, creating a monstrous beast of a chair that truly looks like it was molded by the flames of Balerion. It really looks so much more like how I imagined it in the books, albeit a bit shorter, but I love it aesthetically :)))))
good
Seriously, who's making those trailers. It feels like it should end somewhere in the middle. Boring and underwhelming.
Photo copy of GOT??? Huhhh🤐
I cant freakin wait
House dragon
I think it's cool how the dragons look different but I feel like the cgi is worse
1. 34
Is this after death of mother of dragons ?
😍
HBO Max India release date
black ppl with white dreads look weird
"NOW THEY SEE YOU ARE" shiversss
I would watch this but I can't because I cancelled my HBO max subscription after season 8 of Game of Thrones.
If you think about it the 3 dragons in GOT make sense though. Same clutch of eggs. Would make sense for them to look similar.   The one at the end of the trailer is definitely Vhagar. We’ll get to see a Balerion sized beast, and one of the OG conquest dragons. This is gonna be INSANE.
Are we gona see Balerion?
lacklustre and could they refine the CGI?
Where is balerian the Dread?
I’m a Dragon…🐉🔥💨
48K butthurted  ROP fans
The one thing I like about this is.........the ENDING of the series is already written out so we won't have to deal with a rushed ending.  I hope to see Game of Thrones levels of seasons 1-4 from this show.
i think i see 3 dragons total in this trailer.  Several shots of Syrax, a couple of shots of Caraxes, and 1 shot of Vhagar's leg and tail as she towers over the scene
Might as well replace dragons with butterflies.
Looks garbage haha. Thumb ratio barely scraping above tlotrtrop. Flop incoming.
Hope we can see this in hindi in india
Black Targaryen XDDD
Ν
The new LOTR parody looks garbage compared to this masterpiece
À black targaryan 🤣 this series will be ridiculous
Wow is that doctor who??? I'm hyped
Amazing Visuals... This is going to be epic ❤❤❤
Please dont give dumb stories for 4-5 seasons
Is that the story before House of Cards?
Super hyped but only downside to all of this is that we'll have to wait a whole decade to see the entire thing We'll devour S1 in a single breath and then there's pitch black nothingness for a year or 2, and so on for a whole decade.
🔥🔥
God bless you all , Jesus loves you all only he can save u repent and turn from your sins and accept Jesus as Lord and saviour and  will be saved. He is the only way to eternal life in heaven once you pass away its too late . ❤✝️🙌         ....
Black guy with white hair? Are you serious? Can we stop this nowadays propaganda where at every show there should be a black guy…..this is so stupid
wow
oooo u uuuuuu letsssss gooooo, ITS SHOW TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Now, I need to watch the previous GOT again to understand this.. 😔🙄
Dragons CGI looks worse than in GOT wtf
The Dragons look more realistic than the actors, do we really have to remind that the work of George RR Martin is directly inspired by the European Middle Ages?
Civil war begins
Omg, that looks like a masterpiece...
How many women we need fighting the patriarchy? really? And a random black man casted of-course. It's truly the case where you guys just corrupt instead of creating something new.
The Game of Woke..   The House of Woke..  Will not watch this woke crap even if you paid me $20mil.   May the series please fail abysmally.
Warner Brothers stock has already crashed. This is dead on arrival.
Looks garbage
Hair does not look natural, dissapointed with the casting. Hope i am wrong.
i dint knew dragons were real
The music….👿🥱😴 what were the thinking? If the trailer is anything to go by, it will be a disaster
Please dubb this series in Hindi language ❤️❤️
我是黑党，long live the queen
It is not possible to move forward without the support of friends and viewers, maybe I could not move forward even though I tried a lot!!!  So I wish for your support and love  #777GAMING
so are you gonna mess up the ending with this series again, HBO? no one even mentions abt GOT anymore these days, all thanks to your braindead ending.
a rehash of throne games but with more dragons. easy pass.
This looks terrible
HBO max come in india
HBO ko India me Lao
I really hope this show makes so much money that HBO decides to give  us more. I REALLY want to see the Blackfyre Rebellions
𝙒𝙖𝙞𝙩𝙞𝙣𝙜...................❤🔥#𝙂𝙊𝙏
Alright folks...looks like we are hooked for another 10-15years of the dragan saga series
Open wide more wokeness to force into you
ok
Oh Wow! Looks amazing  and I love the the musical score specially at 1:49.  Cant wait!!
People doubting bc they are still butthurt over GoT season 8, can't blame them, but different directors different story bro.
I almost forgot to see this today
Hope they get Imagine Dragons to do the soundtrack
"Irone Throne: The Drinking Game"
Unlike lord of the rings series this look extremely promising !
Hercules: Gods of Olympus.  Hercules, Game of Thrones Style. Only on HBO.
Yes, a black person... with blond hair... looks... fitting.
This looks really good
Was excited until I saw how woke it's gone.. Fed up of all these films/series getting ruined by wokeness!
This looks absolutely horrendous. Why are these "Targaryens" so dark? Yuck, I think I'll pass on this one.
Lets goooo!!
Daenerys wannabe is ug1 EE @ s FF
We're so ready!!! ❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
I hope there's witful humor in this show.
✊✊🤗🤗🤗
THIS LOOKS LIKE 1 % OF GAME OF THRONES.
Should never bend the knee to Woke
This looks promising. Seems like they are compensating the audience for how GOT ended by bringing back the essence of the show!
muy buena peliculla ya la quiero ver
Pandering with diversity and pronoun usage. Hard pass. George should focus on finishing his series, which is his legacy. Not this crap.
The soundtrack is straight out of the belly of a dragon 🔥
It's happening 💥
That background music deserves an Oscar..... It is damn so good
the visuals look great but the woke casting just kills any hype
Hmm…. Not very exited about the trailer. Clearly had higher hopes after GoT, one of the best shows ever made
After GOT season8 I will not be watching this.
Getting a look at the dragonpit in it’s former glory right at the beginning. It’s the ruins where Bran was declared King of the Six Kingdoms in Game of Thrones.
I'm going to be honest.  This doesn't look fun, nor does it appear to have any sort of originality. In addition, the main characters are so hideous to look at, I have an adverse reaction to just the visuals.  Idk who made this but, it was a mistake.
It's amazing how devoid of emotion I am watching this, after the GoT debacle. Pass for me.
Prequals are crap for lazy writers. There is no quality story, like the first 4 seasons of GoT, that GRR Martin actually worked on, unlike the last four awful seasons.  This is just more crap by awful writers and an awful IP.
The dragons looks so good, very details, every dragon have their own characteristic. I really looking forward for this, I love dragon story so much. Kinda hope eragon got proper adaptaion too, the books is also good.
Honestly, this looks interesting. I feel like the story of Aegon the conqueror would’ve been better 😬😬😬😬
official trailer in only 1080p...
Is that....is that a black guy with blonde hair?
House veleryon is decendeded on the same bloodlines as the targs,why are they black?
Shutaaaaa,, T - T
I like how so many people seem to have forgotten about the dumpster fire the last 2 seasons (especially last season) of Game of Thrones was. People are just super hyped without even a little concern, very forgiving people haha
I plan on having my fingernails removed with plyers so, I'll have to miss tis show entirely.  Damn shame!
For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.   (1 John 5:3) - Repent. The LORD Jesus is coming soon.
Your pile of woke garbage will  burn.
Plz dubbed in Hindi .......for india......🇮🇳
Idk maybe bgm in this could have been better...but I'm sure it's awesome in the series
Why didnt you choose more good looking people like john snow snd khaleesi
Casting doesn't look good
Fans : now HBO will make up for fans after the failure of the eighth season of Game of Thrones Writers : 😂😂
The series may be good, but a European should not watch a work that damages his culture.
Seeing the Dance brought to life like this is literally a dream come true.
It's Just me or Rhaenyra always looks like she wants to sneeze?
So the plot is about a medieval aristocracy that would not accept a woman as their head of state? Seriously?
Can't wait already
I want to watch 10 Seasons at a time🔥
Most awaited series 🌟
But but there will be No Tyrion lennister
OMG The soundrack its AMAZING
Worth a watch. Looking forward to seeing Snow more so than HOD imo
Black Targaryen hahahha fukinh sjw's
I hope this is not some typical feminist kind of stuff
From 'winter is coming' to 'war is afoot'. They always find a way to make us cling to the show even before it starts.
After the BITTER DISAPPOINTMENT of GoT, this seems really refreshing. I am legit excited, especially if you factor in that another fantasy genre-type show which is coming up soon, and which HotD will be competing with, has just flipped off their fans and gone full woke.
Without a Doubt GOT is the best 👍
this will be as bad as season 5 -> 8.. They problably blew their budget on the dragon and forgot they had to write a story
We'll see said the Zen master.
Is it Vhagar we see at the end?
In Hindi?
I'm gonna watch this rather than woke lotr
rất thu hút
#HBOMAX please release it in Hindi Doubing too
This is too insane 🔥🇧🇷
First couple of seasons will be amazing then they'll rush the final third season and basically ruin every careful plot and make you question why anyone even bothered to do anything and major plot points that were hinted at will be forgotten, every tiny hope you had of any  reward for watching faithfully and praying that these developed characters will get anything that amounts to a satisfying end will be crushed to molecules before your eyes  and then, and then you'll remember... its game of thrones and everything is pointless anyway.
9.99 a month, i pay less than 50 cents here lol xd gg
Que saudade desse universo
The only thing that looks off, some of their white hair and Corlys
I hope the dragon has a Scottish accent
No dragon was harmed in the making of this series.
Man I wish they show flashback scenes of how Aegon actually conquered Westeros. I’d like to see what he did to Harrenhal
Woke garbage
I have not watched a single movie or TV show since GoT except Squid Game episode 1 and maybe some p***, but soon I shall return from my coffin with HBO subscription
Blackfyre looks shite I was expecting a badass looking sword
Might loot a tiny little bit better but the sludge is definitely showing through the cracks. We'll see about the writting quality but don't get your hopes up, this screams of damage control. Shiny colors and looking good is one thing but we want a good story first and foremost: and so far we are starved for it. Better deliver or you'll just add to the pile of dungs that have been produced recently.
That image with the dragon into the sun at 1:02 and how the drop of the track whispers is pure and simple ART!
I'll watch this before that steaming hot pile on Amazon's The Rings of Garbage...
Loved GoT. Just wanted to comment that in every work of fantasy, I never see any technological change, even in epochs or ages thousands of years apart!
Im definitely routing for Daemon on this one 😂
It is one of my favorite movie, I am so excited when it will release, Thanks a lot for sharing with us.
👍👍
Damn dude! it's finally here!
Hindi me aayegi????
I love this series I am very excited
I am really sorry
Hope they don’t mess this up like they did with the new  lord of the rings spin off. GOT is probably the best series I’ve watched.
Compared to GoT this looks rly bad. i would be rly suprised if this will be good. No hope so far
Oh I look forward to Nettie
Wow like gOT
I want season 9 so bad man....Dany lives, she was resurrected
If you haven't noticed, the opening music is Venus in Furs by the Velvet Underground from 1966 album, The Velvet Underground & nico.
Ok, this seems interesting.
So I learned today that technology now a days is capable of doing a GOOD Eragon series
I keep looking at trailers and hope to find this interesting some day😖, between so many interesting houses in GOT, i find this one utterly boring, and the dragons 😖, i hope it will not be all about dragons cause then it will cross the border to a Disney series 😅. Just hope to see a lot about the other houses from GOT in this series... NORTH AND WOLFS would have been 1000 x more interesting 😏...... So i watched the season 1, cause there is nothing else out there about GOT  world. I don't like it at all 😖. It doesn't even begin to compair to GOT. I don't like the actors and how they play, the plot is nothing interesting or surprising, and it is full of graphic violence and  showing of blood shedding 🤢. Please  put some more about the other houses in the next seasons, it is sooo boring to see so much about the blond people only 🙄😂. Maybe if it will be taken to where the time line meets the one from GOT, it has a small chance to change into interesting... maybe
1:03 who is that guy supposed to be? 😂
2:30?? Which one is that
So is there going to be the father of little finger lord baelish ??
Please! Renewe the series “The time traveler's wife”!!!
I really hope for lessons on feminism and racism. That's what I look for in my fantasy shows.
african Targarien!!)))
I hope there is another trailer coming 🐉
Feminism
"iron throne" count?
What is the release date
Fire will reign 🔥🔥🔥
Yeah after hearing the crap the show producers want to push and how the last series ended I am not wasting my time with this one
вообще неочем как то
Why is she called queen  if no queen has ever sat on throne?
hbo is about take all of my money yess
Don’t fck this up like the last season of GOT
Nice crossover from the Walking Dead with King Ezekiel  making a memorable apperance and lead role in this one! We might see him fly on the dragon like Daenerys with Bob Marley and the Whalers playing in the background. Can´t wait to see this show!
Can't wait
I love GoT community they’re not just crying about a black Targaryen, like Lotr fans are doing with rings of power, I hope they both have a good reception
Aight, if they get this right ill forget about the miscasting. ITS LOOKS AMAZING
Essa série parece incrível, mal posso esperar para ver!!
is this afroamerican targaryen?)))
Why are there black people everywhere?
no night walkers????
did they seriously make a black targaryen?
I have a huge respect for Ramin Djawadi but the main theme is so similar to Gaunter o' Dimm Theme from Witcher 3.
Please dubbed in Hindi 🥲🥲
Can we jus appreciate HBO
I took a shot of dornish wine everytime they said "iron throne" and nie jsksjoti bdbszvagsh ahsbdbjsn.
i see a lot of dragons so as a lover of dragons i will watch .
Dangerous
War between girls for the throne.... Ehhh
More Geme of Thrones? Puke.
The review of the premier is out and everyone is praising it! Saying its like first few seasons! Now I am super hyped
I think it would be best if they just melted the iron throne for scrap metal.
Why is there a black person lmao
Btw is there anyone better than Ramin in terms of BGM ❣️
I cant hardly wait this..
The scene where the Targaryens said "Choice is an illusion created between those with power and those without"  Then proceeded to fight in slow mo was my favorite.
But why oh why are they fighting for this stupid chair again!!!!  Didn’t we just do that
Why is it all girly about the women
Woke! Hard pass.
Love it! Looks great!  One question: why is there a black Targaryan? As i recall they were all described as very white and almost pale. Does he have reverse micheal jackson disease? Or is he the dreaded diversity hire?
Why does every character have a Snapchat acne-remover filter on them?
shiny, shiny, shiny boots of leather
Omg  I love you HBO
Nope. We haven't forgotten what you did, HBO.
optically not the best actors, but we'll love them - maybe
feels like it could be good...were it not for a certain misrepresented character. oof it looks bad and stands out like a sore thumb.
As expected - Race swapping again. They just cannot stop wrecking everything.
Gotta love me some good tokenism
I hope this won't be a flop
Fingers tightly crossed that this will be a return to form after the disaster that was season 8...i really think this should be an anthology series like American Horror Story where every season or every other season covers a different period with Roberts Rebellion at the top of my list
When Hodor said "Get off my plane!" I was speechless
Dark sister
Race swapping characters again lame this will be a hard pass. Same reason I stopped watching Viking Valhalla. I’m not even white but this is straight just getting old.
wait what? house of THE Dragon? so there is just one?
Balerion?
what an BGM
:O
Everything is boring without the Night King !
Too many dragons, too few drunken  dwarfs 😕
looking forward to this. I just have one question shouldn't there be a younger version of Alicent Hightower as well? Aren't her and Rhaenyra around the same age and at court at the same time.
Can we take a moment to appreciate the music! It honestly slaps
And then Daenerys burned the city for no reason and her nephew stabbed her. The end.
I just can t take this cast serious, i dont know if im going to watch this show onlly because of this cast
Again, it looks like being r4cist is ok as long as your JUST hating white people. ( men ) But usually r4cism is WRONG .. not white people though, that's still ok in Television, movies and commercials.
really.....WOKE AGAIN?!?! count me out.
Please dubbed in Hindi language
Pakistani side roles and blacks are coming :D Wokeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
It's like GoT, but without good actors.
Omg I can't believe what I see
This looks amazing. Only fear is that they will focus too much on very few characters. I like that got had a lot of main characters because it made the stakes higher imo. If they just focus on daemon and the princess it feels too obvious that they would be alive til the end. (haven't read the books)
Nope. After what you did with the final series of GOT I am not going to waste even a minute of my time on this. I am done.
From GOT to HOD 🔥 📛
sieht billig aus
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
looks good!.....was hoping the GoT theme tune was going to kick in in some way tho....would have been the cherry on top. its evocative and a masterpiece (imho ;) ) . i know its a different series/timeline etc...but still.....
What's the releasing date ?
THE PEOPLE WHO STILL WATCH THIS ARE DRONES
Let's hope HBO does not destroy the main storyline on which the whole series is based upon in the last episode or probably in the last series and it's last episode.
This will be ruined like GoT ?
Where is Valar Morghulis
i Can't wait:)
too bad they destroyed the franchise, was so strong.  never underestimate the power of bad writing
compare this with Amazon's Rings of Power...lmao
No character can replace Tyrion Lannister...
What a JOKE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Can't wait for it to come out !
The Doctor goes medieval
Please release to Hindi Indian fans
Plssss we need the music published!! ALL THE DRAGONS ROARED AS ONE
I only hear the throne, the throne, the throne, they have some kind of fixation on it, as if there is nothing else.According to the trailer, it looks like the Witcher series, fake, licked
A show about CGI Dragons must be a lot of fun ..Not
JESUS. Literal chills. Cant wait!!
What is black guy doing in mediaeval Europe ?
coolest thing I have seen in 2022. At the end of the trailer, when the sign of game of throne arrives, I was waiting for the legendary bgm of game of thrones.
What dragon is at 1:00? That dragon leg is hugeee. I don’t think that can be balerion but maybe a flashback or something of his leg
It's Great and all. But are we Ever going to get the final Book? I mean when it 1st came out I still had Glorious brown hair Now I'm basically Targariyan.  Would like to read it before I bite the dust . Plzzz
Meh
17m views
Please HBO Max made this season in Hindi dubbed.🙏🙏
wow amazing 💟
i forgot everyone's name sorry i don't know who you are
Danierys owns iron throne  because of her mother blessings
Marvels should learn a thing or two from HBO, They had good CGI when the Infinity war released but now their greed of making more money by focusing on the quantity instead of quality is making everything worse, don't believe me watch the She hulk trailer after that watch this trailer once again
Ohh boy, This is gonna be good
I'd like to imagine everyone waiting for this to drop, were in the mean time watching "Vikings"? Ragnar and Ivar the boneless kept my medieval blood alive long enough until the house of dragons  comes out.
ain't match the level of GOT
Why am I not surprised that the new show runners for this garbage show that should have remained dead, are just as unimaginative as the 2 traitors D& D. Of all the exciting and original scripts they had that could have gone with that would have given the fans some cool insights into things like the origin of the white walkers, instead they give us a rehash of the exact same Daenerys story, complete with an apparently twin ancestor look alike and around the same age who also is to be the first female heir to the Targaryen throne, how incredibly original. What talent they hired. We don’t need another Daenerys, Emilia Clarke already did that role to perfection, give us original interesting  characters like Lord Bloodraven the evil Targaryen who had a number of adventures before becoming the Three eyed raven. Squandered opportunity’s yet again. I for one won’t be watching this uninspired drivel.
Ramin djawadi 🔥🔥 what a bgm man ♥️♥️♥️🔥🔥🔥
This is gonna be fun every character looks morally grey, I loved ned stark but this is gonna be more fun
There’s two people I want to see in this, Cregan stark of the north and dalton Greyjoy of the iron islands.
and of course book Fire and blood isn't finished, only first part....
Why are we still talking about iron thrones? OMDAYSSS, WHERE IS THE REAL TARGAREYN HISTORY???????????????????????????????????????????????
how to explain the presence of a black lord
don't know why but can't get the vibe of game of thrones.
what is this song?! It's fire.
IM SO HYPED... let's hope George R. R. Martin actually completes the story this time 💀😭🔥💕👍🏽
I hope they say the greatest phrase said in game of thrones, It's targaryentime.
Meh, ya looks alright, hard to care after season 8, although the assault on Castle Black and the Hound V.S Mountain were great. Sigh, guess thats all we could ever expect....
Nostalgia is back  ......... and its SPOT ON
The only thing which seems missing in HOTD is we won't see the characters grow as unlike GOT all of them are already grown up.
I thought Targaryens were pretty people.  I didn't see one in this trailer.
Jon Snow should be watch this.
#king of YouTube and Instagram
Another one of those crappy series where there is attempt to force feminism and black-white thing in super hero series.. just to satisfy their ego. Be realistic, how many men::women fought in real wars, for example Russia-Ukraine war.
Firrrrrrrrrreeeeee
When i first seen the images of this i wasn't keen after watching this trailer i'm interested
Thrones of game final end need make renew version
After GoT broke my heart with season 8, i said i was done for good with the show and possible sequels/prequels, only waiting for the books. But after watching the trailers and knowing Ramin Djawadi and Miguel Sapochnik are involved, i will give this a chance. It actually hyped me like the show did when it was a masterpiece.
Drogon is still the handsomest dragon that ever lived. His piercing eyes speak volumes.
Meh
This looks amazing, can’t wait for the premiere! 😍
I'm choosing Hotstar because it's free
🔥🔥🔥
really looking forward to this. But Would also love to see what happens to Arya travelling west of westeros and prolly Old Valyria before it went into ruins.
Targaryen
Star Wars Prequels anyone??! = Visuals galore and pure shite story...
I want to love this. I would to love to LOVE THIS. But come on guys. You can't ask people to love this. You can't ask people to love incest, no matter how you envelop it. You just can't. Sorry.
Me and a lot of Egyptian's people waiting..🤩
My heart is pounding right now
Can’t wait
Trash...the overwhelming, unnecessary black and white nonsense needs to stop. This show need not have a black dude wearing a blond wig JUST to include. It's ruining things. Looks absolutely ridiculous
Looks better than the new Lord of the Rings series.
Whoever is reading this, I hope you become rich and successful (And go chase your dreams)❤❤   Don't press read more...                  You now have good luck, press like to activate!
Ramin Djawadi about to go ham on this one.
I can't wait for this.but still waiting 👍
House of dragons? more like house of Wyverns!
Shiny, shiny, shiny boots of leather.
I hope, this time the showrunners don't turn the greatness of this show into a biggest spoiler of all time like game of thrones.
Hoping it doesn't end like Game of Thrones otherwise it would just be a waste of time
hard pass.
So, for people who read the books: is the whole woman possibly ascending the throne supposed to be part of the story? I want to know if they changed the story or butchered it to their liking
Contratei HBO no mes de janeiro 2022, paguei para ano inteiro, tive problemas desede o inicio recebi mensagem do suport falando que iria cancelar e me reembolsar e até agora NADA ! faz mais de 3 meses !!! Confiei, paguei me lascei !
So another show for woooomen power and rrrrrrrepresentation in cast 🤣🤣 im gonna laught when all this garbage woke show like this and rings of power gonna be waist of money
seems like it's really going to be fire and blood...can't wait!!!
it looks like house of my mom
they should do the long night, that era is a mystery
A black targarien?
LOTR has better trailer, ty
1:27 Great to see that we have a little feminism in there … we could have just assumed that a Queen would be just normal (like it used to be all over Europe in the past), but no, let us feed the narrative.
Please dubbed all seasons in Hindi
Finally someone that isn't dumb and dumber
Looking forward to this!  Seen goft four times!
I can already tell this is going to be absolute dogshit
GOT's legendary vibes are ruling blood flow in my body after watching this trailer , oh wait! please be over already 🔥
Did I imagine it or is the music Venus in Furs by the Velvet Underground?
The messaging from this trailer is, don’t take this show too seriously because we’re not taking this show seriously at all ,especially with the casting.
I'll only watch this for Djawadi's work. If the story is any good, that's all bonus
Why restart story line
Season 8 completely just ruins this show for me I don't even care anymore It will probably be garbage
It's Vigo, the scourge of Carparthia.
Not sure if I am wrong but we will have to wait for the series to premiere. The released trailer suggest that Prince Daemon, a brother to the late king Viserys I, is the principal rival of Princess Rhaeyra for the Iron throne, whilst in actual fact it was Prince Aegon, the king’s eldest son to his second wife. I pray that this prequel does not change this significant storyline.
how suky this gonna be?
Feminism coming to ruin another TV show
GAME OF THRONE WAS WORST EVER AND TIME WASTE SERIES EVER BECZ OF WORST ENDING OF THE BEST CHARACTERS AND THE WHOLE SERIES ALSO😡
meh... Watching this is like dating your toxic ex-girlfriend's sister. Hopefully, this is a horrible show and helps bury this franchise forever so we can forget GOT ever existed after such a disappointing ending.
Reeks of desperation.
HBO ,  Please release your series in India (Hindi ) Language ... There is so many people wating  for your series .
After what happened with the last season of GOT, I'm not gonna give a second chance to this thing, its just gonna end in disappointment.
Anybody went to the Private Event in Los Angeles? Were they showing the first episode or just the trailer? Any plans to show tv shows to the public at the Academy Museum? Serious request because their sound system for modern tv shows and movies is absolutely. The paid parking is terrible though... Not a recommended place for a matinee viewing.
Anyone noticed background music is sick too 🔥
💥💥💥💥
'Add to cart' - Dragon, girl bosses and delete nudity.
Visuals look cool.but you destroyed Night King lore and final season before.I hope new story’s fate will not be same as old one.
This Soundtrack is a complete rip off from Velvet Undergrounds "Venus In Furs"
Music 💥💥💥💥💥
MEGA <3 <3 <3   I LOVE IT
Oh, give it a chance.  HBO rarely does us wrong.
Another woke raceswap. #GetWokeGoBroke
I thought choose your plan was part of the trailer 😅
I’m sorry but there is no way that family should be black there valerians they are definitely described as being pale. And the producer or writer admitted he only did it so there was not to many white people
Can't wait to watch the series...😍😍
I see they're still using Wyverns and not Dragons. smh
Too woke.
At 1:48 is it Balerion ? the biggest dragon ever lived ?
Yes, yes. Another GOT series where they build you up with very good storylines and plots and then crush you with a very lousy ending...
Too many bots in the comment section , to promote this woke show The agenda and the message is killing the entertainement industry
This show will be so (woke) mark my words
wow
Alot of bots in this chat, so dont get carrired away with the comments written. The majoirty is very sceptical and the cgi looks like its from early 2000.
Can i watch this series on Disney?
The characters don't look tough or in a rough situation like it had in the original. They seems ordinary.
So basically: Bad man doesn't want woman to rule. Nice
Pls don't woke
fix season 8
Looks cool but it's hard to take the show seriously when they purposely cast black dudes for what should clearly be white dudes...I'm not opposed to having black actors in the show at all, but give them an appropriate role, dont just randomly throw them in there with blonde wigs to appease social justice warriors.
go woke, go broke.
Is this a movie or series?
so its about Dance of the Dragons?
It's so weird to have a black people in the series.
This How to Train Your Dragon sequel does not look suitable for children.
Niceee
Having that random black dude in there is so jarring and strange, everyone knows this yet only half of us will admit it.
China sponsored movie, not hollywood production.. boycott
fool me once shame on you...
Man that score is drillling my ears🔥
This just looks like a complete mess
2:30 I'm sure this dragon is Vermithor, the second biggest ever
The 3 dragons Daenerys had in GOT were identical triplets that's why they looked the same 🙄
Perfect timing, my fiancé and I are almost done rewatching GoT. Despite the hate, it’s easily one of my favorite shows of all time. Can’t wait for this one 🤞
This looks cheap and cringe.
Awwwwwq
Im waitinggggg!!!!
We'll get to see mad king, dragons, targeyreans, white walkers and probably castamere song played when stark and Lannister killed mad king. Huh somehow I'm not getting any interest after that horrendous writing of last 2 seasons of game of thrones.
I think this would be epic experience
Imagine! Henry Cavill and jason mamoa in this....🌞
This looks better than Lord of The Rings on Amazon at least.
Just keep Weiss & Benioff in a different hemisphere from this production at all times. If this show suffers from GoT terrible writing from S7&8 it will be a disaster.  Also a black Targaryen cause why not? We don’t want the audience just watching a screen of whities, now do we?
01:31 Nice..
So were black targaryens a thing or is this more forced diversity?
1:45 I love how his hair is blowing back as the Dragon breaths out, good attention to detail.
I hope they take more than a couple episodes to turn someone into an insane war criminal this time
This looks average at best
In the end Rhaenyra's brother feeds her to his dragon with her kid watching and all of the dragons die.
👍👍
so, 8 seasons of male vs female throne fight? no, thanks
👍
*Please continue this great work. I like your video. I wish you good health and success
"I don't want it."
Every morning when I wake up I seek for natia comedy one of the best comedy in the world💞💞💞
Looks whack
Looks pretty dope. Yeah the last 2 seasons were bad sure but i'm not a baby so let's watch it.
Anyone have a count on how many times "Iron Throne" was said..
My dream becomes a reality...*)! When I watched Game of Thrones I always said "I wish they would make a spin off about the dragons, because these were my favorite scenes! THANK YOU...*)))
NOPE ! This looks like a CW series. So bad.
WOKE
‘AN HBO original series’ - 😂
All I wanna see the balerion the dread😭😭
I have high hopes for this!!!!
Won’t dedicate anytime to this. They lost my trust with last series
Game of thrones & House of dragons  The greatest TV Series of all time
It's funny how in the terms of the books I prefer Sapkowski over Martin and put Tolkien over both of them but in terms of series "House of Dragon" is the only show I believe will be decent. And for certain, much better than these abominations called "Witcher" and "Rings of Power"...
plz release a hindi dubbed too
So much fake blonde hair going on lol
So clearly HBO hired someone to bot their channel with BS comments cuz that all im seeing!
Saludos desde GUATEMALA 🔥👌🏻 la
They need char's showing emotions for reels in first season for show to catch on.  Sean Bean did this perfect in got1.  Visually seems all good. 😀
Never forget corleese velaryion from the hood of velaryion
Let's gooooo!  Bring it HBO!  This looks amazing!
weak. always the same premise. 'Woman wants to take the throne" why cant it be about something completely different. writers did a great job mixing it up lol
seems like the joke didnt end with GOT
Soo uhmmm is this faithful to the books?
A black Targaryan?  BWAHAHAHAHA. 😂🤣
Was there white hair people once upon a time?
BOOOOOOOORRRRIIIINNNNNGGGGGGGG!
This looks like everything I ever wanted from Dance of Dragons...
Looks like the same story all over again
This looks liek it will be really good but the writers will probably get bored in about 6 years and rush the ending.
Aww, those cute as a button dragons, I wish I could pet them.
ohhh ... let me guess the ending ... theyll make rhaenyra win and then kill the strong female character!!!!!
sneed
Won't the Night King and the White Walkers appear in this series ????
Lame
I really want this to be good. I keep my fingers crossed.  But it LOOKS like the latter seasons.
i cant breef
i cant breef
Those dragons excite me more than anything 🔥🔥🔥
ye sure lets waste 10 years for  a  **** last season no thx guys  we are  ok
so Daenerys 2.0 🥱
🔥🔥🔥 wait for legend music
i would be more excited if they make season 7 and 8 again with the writing of JRRM.
Что я могу сказать - выглядит неплохо. Уж точно лучше, чем отвратное зрелище от амазона, оскорбляющее первоисточник.
I tried giving it a chance after what happened with GoT, I really did, but I watched the trailer and felt absolutely no pressure to ever watch this. Especially since the Targaryens were never my favourite part of the world. White Walkers were, but oh.. guess that ship has sailed now.
Get me a barf bag
Imagine if Dragon could talk like Smaug! If some dragons could spit ice and/or ball of smoke that would explode on striking any surface that be awesome!
According to Olivia Cooke: "There is also a focus on childbirth and its inherent dangers, a story thread that feels timely in the wake of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade. “The child bed is our battlefield” and “In medieval times, giving birth was violence,” Sapochnik says. “It’s as dangerous as it gets. You have a 50/50 chance of making it."  and, of course, the lead actor identifies as They/Them and men are responsible for the fall of everything, so... More Woke propaganda to spoon feed the masses. Hard Pass.
Please be good... Please be good... Please be good
Buycott this damnnn prequel it's already damned by d&d with season 8 got until and unless there won't be proper ending of got i won't watch
But got is incomplete without the night king..☠️💀💟
I like the dragons 🐉
I really hated season 8 and cant bring myself to watch this show. I mean already know how it all ends
Is it just me or when it say An HBO series; it should be A HBO Series? Have they made a typo lol?
каст в трейлере какой-то не очень. та и в целом ...
Is the background music Venus in Furs? By Velvet Underground, I swear it really sounds like it.
Very excited to see Matt Smith!
Now they have removed the D&D hope has been kindled.
This looks great! Lets hope they don't just stick on a formulaic rubbish end on it, like they did last time.
When i see how they changed Corlys Optically to match some "inclusion" or "black quota" i instantly think of the end of game of thrones where they also derivated to much from the source. well time to see GOT go down the drain a second time
Knowing what will happen to that throne at the end of story..ruins the whole picture 😅
The musis is lit...the buildup, the quality, the effects, everything looks real... can't wait to watch it...
I thought there would be bigger dragons
I just dont understand these trailers the amount of spoilers...we saw that guy with an eye patch so he will lose an eye somehow? Or he is just doing it for training purposes? How many trailers and teasers we got already 3 or 4 ? Might as well put the entire show already....
Hmm... strange. This doesn't look like the re-shoot of season 8?  In all seriousness though. I'll give it a shot. If it's woke garbage, count me out.
Gel artık...
That was sick.  Best 👌 👍 great cast
01:02 - Goosebump moment!!!
This show will do justice to time travel from Dragons - no Dragons - Dragons again, till king slyer ice Aerys the second. Connecting dots, enriching entertainment....massive respect to HBB. Just dont turn down brightness man, now that we have lot of dragons to provide extra ambient light..lol
So it's a feminist and a woke show!
Fool me once...
حماس😯
I wonder why they changed the succession battle from Rhaenyra vs Aegon II to Rhaenyra vs Daemon for TV?! Seems unnecessary but we will see.
This is going to be awesome
Caraxaes looks terrific
จิดจะนากานตฅำ่กว่าความรู้
If there ever comes a sequel about this, I hope with all my heart it will be about Robert's Rebellion
Thought it was smaug ;(
reminder of GOT
please dubbed in hindi
less then a month to go now and i’m exited af
Mad respect to HBO for using real dragons instead of CGI like in Game of Thrones. I hope everyone is safe during filming.
Dubbed in Hindi India 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳 We want Hindi dubbed.
Yayyy more feminist hollywood garbage. Super excited about this one!
So this is going to be Targaryens fighting Targaryens, that explains why there were only so few left on GoT.
Poor and clunky dialogue, doesn't look great or nearly as interesting as the original, also too much dragon stuff in it.
0:12 "Twinkle twinkle..."
Looks amazing love how the intrigue is still there for the throne.. characters look interesting and acting doesn’t look over the top. Can’t wait
I’d have them bring Sean Bean back to play the current Lord of Winterfell, ancestor of Ned. I’d have him last more than one season too!
We're getting close
Fool me once, shame on you...
I hope it is good but considering all the PC garbage coming out the past few years, I am not holding my breath. The good thing is I can always go back and re-watch GOT again.
Did not see a single piece of compelling dialogue and the dragon CGI looks really bad. Going to be a mess
I only hope its presentation is less Hollywood and more OG GoT.
That last dragon looked awful.
I hope they show other aspects like the wall and the nights watch and the white walkers
Guna be trash just like season 8.
Yay... more forced diversity. Can't wait to see bad blonde wigs on people of "color." Cringe.
GOT will never be the same without original characters
มาแล้ว
Where’s the dislike button when you need it?
FINALLY, the dragons dont look like copy paste 3 times the same design with different colors like in game of thrones, they have different neck lengths and headshapes, horns, eyes wings AMAZIGN!!!!
😁😢
Game of Thrones - We're back baby 🐲
directed by dan and dave
What that looks Awesome!!! That is going to make a splash!!
I can not wait!!!!! 🐉🧝🏻‍♂️🐉🧝🏻‍♀️✨💫🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This looks horrible but the comments say it looks good, whats going on here.
War is a foot..literal chills
looks like bridgerton garbage with some dragons in it
House of Wokeness 🚽
Milking a dead 🐮
I hope the Starks don't get butchered in this story as well
💩
From the looks they've given personality to the dragons. Hope to see more of this and their bond to riders so that they are not just  slaves but intelligent companions. I love dragons.
why are some guys wearing mops on their heads? 🤣🤣
Who cares
HBO thank you what we all need can't wait this will be excellent
this trailer looked boring. Small clips of dragons and a lot of blah blah blah iron throne. Its basically made for woke feminazis with the "strong womenz" characters in this spin off show.
going to wait till its over to see it all in one go least that way it wont hurt as bad as GOT after waiting years IT STILL HURTS TO THINK ABOUT HOW IT ENDED
My psychiatrist said dragons are not real.
so you made blackfrye literally black even though in the books they look just like the targeryns.
AGAINST THE PATRIARCHY!!!
Time for me renew my HBO Max subscription 💳 💥
How pathetically woke  A black guy with white dreadlocks   no doubt married to a white woman ffs
Why are they fighting for a hair of the throne?
Honestly, after the disaster, and botched piece of crap that season eight of Game of Thrones was, I have lost interest in the series. George RR Martin should pay more time into finishing writing the series, rather than continuing to feed into spinoffs.
Thought it might look interesting. Oh well. :)
@HBO Max its time to make it possible to subscribe to your services here in Luxembourg, lot of people are waiting for that
"no queen has sat on the iron throne.."  *laughs in Visenya and Rhaenys*
We wuz kangz moment
Nah, pass
I really hope we don't have to wait 3 seasons for dragons on this show too
I'm gonna be that guy, the dragon in that trailer looks stupid
No thanks. I have better things to do than care about fantasy shows.  On account, they dont care about us back.
the unbeatable Hound and Mountain will also  be missed
Can´t wait
Should I watch this before watching Game of Thrones??
Remake Game of Thrones season 8.
The Kingsguards look great.
A Woman would not inherit the Iron Throne. Cersei Hold my Beer.
CHILLS. LITERAL CHILLS. I AM SOOOO EXCITED FOR THIS SHOWWW OMGGGG
Stranger things is still better
So they basically give us what Daenerys should have become?
Matt Smiths character won’t make it past the first season.
Nothing Appealing for me...."கரகாட்டக்காரன்" , "எங்க ஊரு பூவாத்தா" "வானத்தை போல" are far better than these Just screaming monsters".
this series will have a lot of Morbin going on!
Waiting 😍
Valaryian features: Silver hair, purples eyes, and pale skin.   Casting a sub saharan featured person....😒  Another clearly white character falls to "diversity." It wouldn't matter that much, but it's never and Asian, Indian, Hispanic, Islander, or Arab cast in the place. It's always a Sub-Saharan black. It always is. That's "diversity" to Hollywoke!
Note to PETA - No dragons were harmed during filming!
My drug is back..my drug is back. Oh how many years have I been missing it 😍😍
I'm planning to read the books, but I don't know what to read first?
Can’t wait for this show !!!!
Targaryen: "A great dynasty of fire and blood, our future 300 years from now looks bright" Bran: "Guys hear me out..."
Amazing medieval version of Venus in Furs by the Velvet Underground is the song playing here, I wonder if that’s just for the trailer or if they’re going to score the entire series with instrumental versions of popular songs?
The trailer gives me hope as the ending of GOT still leaves a bad taste in my mouth but hopefully this will have more of the battles over the throne theme that made the early seasons so great.
Music is phenomenal as always 😍
Why these dragon are too small  compares with GOT dragon's?
Damn this looks better than The Rings of Power ...
Please dubb this show unlike Game of thrones
Rhaenyra Targaryen has Daenerys Vibes 🔥🐉
Is this even a different story? The female lead looks almost just like Emilia Clark did in costume and the story still seems to be "Can we girl power in medieval fantasy?" "We'll MAKE THEM let us girl power!".
The music never fails in got
Woke woke woke
very much excited to see the show.
Wokesteros
Love the soundtrack
you all sheep forgot season 8 and still gonna support that lol pathetic!!
G.O.T. WOKE!
Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.
Targareyens are closer to God than to men. ❣️
i’ve been waiting for so long oh my gosh
Waiting 🥳
Lets all talk about the fact they use wyvren's not dragons
Looks boring and cheap. Turn it into a blockbuster movie with big budget.
GRRM is gonna need to go into hiding. Now people are going to be harassing him about volume 2 of Fire & Blood as well as The Winds of Winter
I’ve worked on 4 episodes. One of the dragons was very friendly. A male. His name was Barka. So well trained we didn’t have to do retakes for the most part. I think the crew misses him so much. An experience we’ll never forget. Miss you Barka!  Oh! And shoot out to Alessandro, his trainer! Amazing dude.            👀😬😬😬🤣🤣🤣
Thank the lord i hope it will be as good as season 1-4 of game of thrones
Ramin Djawadi is composing its going to be a banger🔥
Yay, more terrible writing and acting covered up by cgi lizards 🦎
Very heavy lifting of costumes & feel of Moorcock's Elric of Melnibone, especially the Epic / First Comics 80s/90s aesthetic. Almost identical in some scenes actually. Oh well. Mimicry is the highest form of flattery and all that......

Is that a instrumental version of "Venus in Furs" (Velvet Underground) playing in the background?
(This diatribe below, will really only make complete & utter sense to the die-hard, true fans who have read every book; not once - but several times. Out of the pure & utter appreciation for what our language - when used in such a manner of true brilliance, & love for the craft... That all being said...)    This makes me once again enthralled by/with the ever-evolving imagination that we, as human beings - in so many infinite aspects - possess; and continue to progress. I was truly heartbroken, angry, bewildered, shocked (in an indescribably negative sense), & resigned myself - once again - to fully enveloping myself in the books, & the dastardly hope that G.R.R.M. would/will actually & TRULY complete ASOIAF so that all could be bring the majesty of this franchise/World to a JUST, SENSIBLE, HASHED-OUT, ENTHRALLING way.    But, My God, I hope I am not prematurely (& yes, more or less, based on this trailer, alone) excitedly re-investing myself into cinematic version of this seemingly-endless, beautifully-written - into what's unfolded into a true literary work-of-art; Exploring every & all senses, emotions, being both terrified, enthralled, & elated with the turning of each & every page.    In all honesty... it isn't/wasn't even the trailer in it's entirety; But (and TRULY DIE-HARD fans will surely appreciate this - as much as I...) when I got the first glance of His Grace's hand on the arm of the throne; THEN to furthermore grab a glance of House of the Dragon's version of the Iron Throne, in comparison to the horribly, almost mockingly-done version in AGOT - that there - for me - was enough of a hope that this series may just capture the TRUE essence of what it always meant to.  *Fingers crossed, & any & all wood in my vicinity has been knocked on*  ...Let us hope we can rejoice - once again - in what the initial half of AGOT accomplished; and that the passion for the story, & World (in it's entirety) that was - at 1st captured - only to be haphazardly, & disrespectfully-abandoned by D&D - will INSTEAD - ring true initially AND throughout H.O.T.D. - from the 1st scene - to the very last; Reinstalling my faith in cinematic storytelling.
This looks like its chock-full of estrogen.
Her: No woman sits on the iron throne, thats the order of the world. Future: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Where is my dragons ?
0:50 Daemon Targaryen, the rogue prince   *cue the music*
Looks terrible
1:24 Do you think the realm will ever accept me as their queen? A woman would not inherit the Iron Throne. Because that is the order of things. When i am queen, i will create a new order. *epic lines*
nice video
Crystal Dragon Power
I SHOULD be really excited for this - however I know how the GoT story ends, so just cant bring myself to be.
Wait is the whole dance shown in this season? Cause that last frame I think is sunfire, about to do what sunfire last did?  I thought it’s about to be at least 3-4 seasons
I just hope Ramin Djavadi is composing again. I absolutely love his work!
Except for the dragons, I dint find anything interesting here!
Please don't make this "WOKE" THATS ALL I ASK!!!!!!?
I got goosebumps when Daemon said ‘it’s Targin’ Time’
House Targaryen thr most powrful house knights and beauty...
do you guys think we’ll see dragons clapping som cheeks?
Super 👌👌👌👌
Idk, the Targaryens fighting amongst themselves for the throne doesn't interest me as much
Couldn't ever watch another GOT show after the ending of last 😢
Wow, how to train your dragon live action looks epic
they could have just fixed  the damn last season
It will all depend how good the writing is. The trailer shows nothing really interesting for me. Iron throne this, iron throne that, claim it, heir to it, women in power, blablabla. I will wait until some folks review it and if they say its good, before ruining my memories of GoT.( seasons 7 and 8 already kind of did that, so I gotta be careful)
so excited, i hope they cover blackfire rebellion next
What is this Venus in Furs over?
Available in hindi ?
I love this music 😍.. Where can i get it as ringtone?
Everything look so high-quality. I have a good feeling about this
Where is Danareys Targaryen then the iron throne is back
Anyone question why HBO choose not to green light Aegons Conquest???
so hyped for this show
Clap
*I really like how each dragon has its own look, they're not basically copied and pasted from one. They seem to all be different sizes and colours which makes this show seem like more attention was paid to the detail.*
heres hoping it's book accurate, not "woke", and actually good
god the copium in the comments is legend.   mindless sheep for consumers.
This looks like woke infected trash. A story about the most powerful family to ever rule the seven kingdoms and somehow a third of the preview is all “aGaInSt ThE pAtRiArChY WOman PoWeR”. We already had Dani. Give it a rest.  Really hope it isn’t.
Man I need to catch up on my info...I forgot who the red dragon is?
👎 re-do the last 2 seasons of G.O.T. and STFU with this new crap.
I hope I don't have to wait 7-8years to see a c- ending like I did with the game of thrones. DON'T LET ME DOWN AGAIN HBO!
dragons look small
A classic fantasy tale of House Mudsharrk and House Feminyst versus the only guy who actually looks cool and does a lot of fighting.
This will be bad.
Drakarys!!! Hoped I didn't get the spelling wrong. Don't speak Valerian!
OMG! I only know that I am going to watch game of thrones because of the great expectation of seeing the dragons
GoT is a travesty, even remembering it make me want to puke, hopefully this new show can stay away from cheap writing and unnecessary drama.
We need something good after Season 8 off GoT.
Esto es hermoso !!!
Where is extended trailer
Looks terrible.
Ohh good, more entertainment about the patriarchy and the power of WOMAN!   The evilest character will be the whitest male in the cast.  Women (whatever that is these days) will rise and be the greatest ever!  Yawn...
Little shaky on the kingsguard armor design. I prefer the more simple design from the early seasons of Game of Thrones but everything looks good.
Vhagar(Visenya's dragon) is still alive here. It will be wild to see a dragon ridden during Aegon's conquest.
isso está incrível!!!
Thank you so muck HBO
Wth there’s a black guy?
Please don’t be GOT and tease dragons but show little of them until the end episodes.
정말 최고의 시리즈입니다
😱😁👍🏻🥰🤗🇨🇦💖
HBO have to make 8 seasons of house of dragon just to make it up for the final season of GOT.  Seems fair to me.
Nice token black. lmfao.
Next  Blackfyre Rebellion after the Dance of Dragons right?
I think jon snow is the night king
Stupid people belive dragon are Real😂 stupid people exist 😂 i laugh so hard low education 😂
I'm only one that sick of them pushing woman can't be queen.  It was about her so s were secretly bastards.
Waiting to see rickon and Cregane stark
Really looking forward to this one! :D
All I know is this show is gonna be great, and then end in flames.
Oppressed wamens gonna fight for the man's throne to change the patriarchal order- zzzzzzz this stupid feminist crap is boring, and propaganda is NOT entertainment.
Meh
We were all disapointed by the final season of Game of Thrones, but you're deluding yourself if you think this show doesn't, at least, look well made and promising.
While no GOT spin-off would be compete without political power games, I really wanted this to go deeper into the magical side of things. Targaryens have a strong connection to magic, and the mystical/cosmic horror dimension of song of ice and fire is for me the most intriguing element.
haaaa yes the message is everywhere on that future pile of crap!
Fck season 8, Fck Game of Thrones, Fck D&D, Fck Targaryens.
🔥
More trash. I'll pass.
How many times were they going to bring up her sitting on the iron throne
Same of Thrones
The sound, the looks, the acting, all is top notch, I only wish they would out of respect for the fans undue the last 2 seasons, maybe even the last 3, of the original series, rewrite and correct the mess the 2 iD&Diots left behind once they ran out of material, because knowing what a disappointment the final story is, I don't know if I would be willing to invest any time at all in a prequel of a story that in the end leads nowhere, no matter how promising it once was or might be again... Better call Saul worked only because breaking bad was until the very end a masterpiece, not like GoT specially the final season...
Wow this trailer just ramped up my excitement for this series! Dracarys! 🐲🔥
I feel that the production has done good work. Something I cannot say for the Rings of Power.
wow that trailer is boring
I wonder if the dragon fire will be book accurate, matching the color of their scales
Why does it start with “AN HBO” should it not be “A HBO”?? Or am I missing something here.
A show about how women should be in power…but with dragons.  Thank you Hollywood for always knowing just what the people want.
Everything looks grey and ugly. Gross.
Just please don't pull a *_"Season 8"_* , not sure we can handle that again.
I’m ready to be hurt again HBO.
what happened at the end of Game of Thrones...couldnt bring myself to watch the last 3 episodes...life is too short.
I don't have high hopes, but who knows. It looks quite promising and epic!
I still absolutely love the original Game Of Thrones series, all 8 seasons. Its far from perfect, but still an incredibly entertaining ride. Cannot wait to see House Of The Dragon.
How greed foreshadows blood…
El pepe
It looks like this series can be worse than netflix witcher...
😎😎😎😎
Whoa  this way too good. Thank you George  4 empowering women  :)))) this is gonna b fabulous with Miguel and Bryan wow I'm so, so excited 4 this 😀
All the CGI funds for the dragons none to spare for Lilac eyes again?
Woke game thrones in coming
This show couldn't have been in better hands. It's literally handled by creative and competent people, namely George RR Martin, Ryan Condal and Miguel Sapocknik, who are a winning combination of author, creator and director.   George wrote the book Fire and Blood. He also wrote A Song of Ice and Fire which the show Game of Thrones is based on. Read the books. He's a genius.  Ryan is a strong writer according to George RR Martin on his interview on Game of Owns podcast. Personally, I am 100% behind Ryan because he is experienced with a track record in the TV series business.   Then Sapochnik directed some of the best episodes of Game of Thrones and even won an Emmy.   HotD will be narratively stronger, more engaging and overall consistent in quality. The hype and culture will be like GoT all over again. It's literally the best time to be alive right now 😊 😀 😄 😆
Lovely dragons. I wonder that they look different from ones in GoT.
No one talking about Venus In The Furs 🤷🏽‍♂️😳🤦🏽‍♂️
Spoilers below              What really gets me excited is that despite Rhaenyra and Rhaenys talking about the patriarchy and how the former plans to change that, as a guy whose read Fire and Blood and provided they stay true to the source material, then I know this isn't gonna be something that preaches "the message", but ends how Fire and Blood did, with each combatant, Rhaenyra and Aegon alike, being declared by history to have been equally mad and UNworthy of the Iron Throne.
I am a die hard Game of Thrones fan, but I not so sure about this
HBO is dead to me... you know since when, i suppose.
BGM sounds VELVET UNDERGROUND VENUS IN FURS
Welcome to the world of G.O.T. again. The most addictive series made in the human history ❤️❤️ #HBO LOVE ❤️ FROM INDIA🇮🇳
Incrível demais 🇧🇷
The production value seems really high, remain to see if the writing team can plan a consistent good story
LOTR > GOT in terms of books but I guess series will be vice a versa
It's a prequel
What is the theme playing background?
Watching 2mins49sec of HOD = Remembering pain of final season of GOT
Just don't be as crappy as the final season of GOT please.
august 21st? well then, i quess I will be watching this while playing Immortal empires, total war warhammer III 😄
I expect to be thrilled with all seasons of this show, and disappointed with the last one.
So…it’s written by RR Martin…?
Game of thrones was written where no one saw anything coming. This seems like any other medieval tv show :/ Dragon cgi isn’t as good either sadly. But we’ll see I guess.
So this trailer can be summed up as "Look guys! We have dragons! Ooh, ahh!"  They really hoping you'll watch because dragons cool.
It’s official I am excited , the stink from got s7 and 8 has left the room , I am ready to love again 😅😂
Been waiting for this ever since I've read the story ✌🏽💯.
Господи ты боже мой - ЧТо это за срань???
Even the preview seems less epic than the book. It's free here on YT. Catch up before October.
Was that caraxes?
This looks actually good. Unlike Prime Video.. I am rooting for HoD

Is that Velvet Underground in the score?
It's incredible how much better this looks compared to basically every other fantasy show of the last couple of years. This looks like everything I ever wanted from Dance of Dragons
Olny waiting for it come out for critics to absolutely murder it
Mad respect to HBO for using real dragons instead of CGI like in Game of Thrones. I hope everyone is safe during filming.
This is like beast!!
I'm sorry.. But if it doesn't have GAME OF THRONES b4 or after it.. I'm good! Like "GAME of THRONES JON SNOW" That's just me guys
I got to ask are they gonna inspire all the series on actual wars, because Got was clearly War of the Roses, and now with the uncle vs daughter it's like the first Carlist War if it was medieval
The dragons are weird 👀 sorry.
HBO Please Make It In Hindi Language
Looks great. But in the end they only have Jon Snow left.
Plz dubb this all series past and upcoming episodes in official hindi dubb...The lots of fan following is in india...We are Waiting for this...Love From India..😍😊💯🤗
I will watch after all episodes are released. HBO tricked me for 8 years into GoT for nothing. Not this time HBO.
This new Game of Thrones show sucks that I don't like it either. Please let us watch Game of Thrones on HBO Max now!
We all know the woman is going to win
comment section, 90% - OMG dragons 10% - Oh... dragons
The biggest asset of the GOT & HOTD is Ramin Djawadi. What a pleasant music he given us in GOT.
Please dubbed in Hindi also.
Why everone looks so plastic?
Going to be garbage "showrunners explain how the new series tackles issues of race and sexual violence" more woke garbage.
Ok this one's better than Rings of Power
House of the dragon will be better than rings of power
All the dragons roared as one
Strategically comes out two weeks before Lord of the Rings the Rings of Power 🤣
I hope this is not going to be another woke storyline with "strong female" heroins that would ruin the show.
Could anyone smell bits of "jenny of oldstone" in that music ?
So I guess all the black people will be erraticated in this show eh
Looks cool! 😏
Feminist: this series should be a feminist show.
Can’t wait to watch this!! love matt
I have a question/concern.  Which dingus decided to call this House of Dragon, rather than A Dance of Dragons, as the entire period and events are historically known within the universe? What, were they afraid that it might provide spoilers? Because those who would be spoiled are already so, no matter how you call the show. Or was there fear that the poor widdle numb-numbs who enjoy the books would get confused with a show having mostly the same name as a book, but the events of the show are different because it covers the events and period of Westeros history for which the book name was the call/shout out? Because that is just insulting.  This stinks of stupid studio decisions, which combined with the farce that the last two seasons of GoT turned into, really makes me not want to give this any of my time, no matter how pretty the trailer is, and I doubt I'm the only one.
I know this won't be as legendary as the original 👉 A lot of movies and tv shows failed when they decided to extend with different story lines just to "exploit for 💰 from the original's success" 👉 just to mention some....Lord of the rings....Matrix...etc
Huge shoutout to Elon Musk who give his pets dragon to HBO for House of the Dragon 🐉
I'm addicted to this trailer. The music and the editing are beyond perfect. Especially after 0:34. But they never release those ost😔
Al hype to the camera man who agreed to shoot with dragons.
I can’t wait to watch this series
God this looks boring
what I want is danerys alive
I always see this on our TV I'm excited 😍😍
can't wait to love every episode except the last one
This is going to be like the hobbit where it’s a prequel just not as good as the original
Looks like woke broke garbage as soon as they got away from the Novels they do this 👏👏👏
Will John Snow be in this show?
Lol is this the history of the Easter Roman Empire?
*sees black Velaryon*: dislike
Fire and Blood
I'm hype too see Balerion
One word: ASTIG
Tv glory is back one of the best series is back the real art.
house of wyverns* those aren't dragons lmao
All looks perfect. 🔥 A maior série vem aí.
💥
when HBO does a new season/spinf off of got, the gods flip a coin, it can be the gratest tv show ever, OR THE F**** WORST DISAPOINTMENT EVER. Hope they learned from their mistakes, if not lord of the rings is going to destroy them...
Did anyone else see the Starbucks cup on the table at 0:38?
As Lord Varys rightly said "Everytime a Targaryen is born...."
Hope no one will ruin this one too,,otherwise its cruising nicely
Dracarys
Let's just hope we don't get burned again...
I wish they came out with house of dragons first, cause we all know what happens to the queen of dragons in the end....but I hope they wrote/ finish this series 1000x better than how they ended game of thrones
I hope the classic HBO nudity still remains!
Going to watch this  only for the dragons
🔥🔥
when i saw this trailer my overwhelming feeling was weariness
Music is really awesome🙂
Hbo you failed so miserably at game of thrones you convinced me u will betray your audience on this too 🤮
Looks kind of alright but seems a petty thing to fight over!
Game of thrones next season 🙄
HBO spent more money on this comment section than the show
🤡Don't Ask Questions, Just Consume Product and Then Get Excited for Next Products.💩
Telugu plz.....
Hope someone else did the writing rather than those who took over when GoT ran out of source material.
now that we saw all S1 in this trailer, when can we see the S2 ?
Dang I thought this would be about how the iron throne came to be. Guess will have to wait another decade for that prequel
You watch that trailer not for the first time, don't you?
What's with the name? Drop the 'the'. House of Dragons sounds much better
Just going to watch it for the dragons, not the story anyway 🐉💖
Looks epic
Take a shot every time your hear ‘Iron Throne’
Disney ruins Star Wars, Amazon ruins Lord of the rings and now HBO ruins Game of Thrones even more! Why can’t you stick to the lore and make a half way decent show? Stop trying to educate us with your Hollywood bubble view on the world. Where do you find these show runners? But credits for ruining the once greatest show on TV after season 8 even more, I have never thought this would be possible nevertheless you did it!
Awesome music
Can't wait.  Loved the first series and this looks promising.  It's got a lot to measure up to though.
Hope its good but GoT ruined any chance of me liking this
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Waited long enough, now let the dragons dance
BLACK LIVES MATTER!!!! NO JUSTICE NO PEACE!!!!!!!!!
🤩
I wanna see Princess Nymeria!!!!!!!!!
Malayaali aarum ille🤕
Amazing , I think the Targaryens are inspired by the Habsburgs and Rhaenyra is Empress Maria Theresa
Can't wait🔥❤🔥❤🔥❤🔥❤🔥❤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This looks good. I can't wait to see it.
To anybody who's reading this, I pray that whatever is hurting you or whatever you are constantly stressing about gets better. May the dark thoughts, the overthinking, and the doubt exit your mind. May clarity replace confusion. May peace and calmness fill your life. 🙏
Please Hindi dubbing😭😭😭😭😭😭
I’d of watched this if you hadn’t butchered Game of Thrones and killed all the faith I had in you. Will see how the reviews go I guess.
My god the BGM uff
Let's dance 🐲🐲🐲
Emilia Clarke...
I need a big statue of Daenerys Targaryen in this series 🛐🛐 ..,. One n only love 💔🥺
Vampire Diaries, Originals, Legacies are Ice and Fire, scenes are twilight. Witcher, Rome, House of Dragons is Fire and Ice.
Let's start humble, I know my cousins.
Fool me once shame on you.  Fool me twice....
Man GOT cast ,,, there will be no equal to that
OMG this is such an amazing trailer. This trailer is better than GOT S8
"The king has an heir, Daemon Targaryan."  "Yeah, thanks for letting me know Jamal."
I do not remember it the velaryons were black.
Is that charles dance voice at .43 secs?!?!??!??
I want to see vhagar vs caraxes. That Will be epic and Will be the most epic scene in tv history 🔥
I'll wait 2 years after series is complete to get DVD boxset. Same as I did GOT.
I am BEGGING for the theme song to be a banger
I just wanna see more dragons 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Is 1:00 ser Cristan Cole ? Gods be good, he looks hot
Why's every other dialogue "I'm the king/queen"?
I'm halfway thru the book, the book is great
😭😭😭
Keep it up😍🔥❤️✨️
2:14 Ramin Djawadi really is something else.
she has to die because even in GoT, Dany wanted to be the first woman on the throne.
Anyone here gonna talk about Ramin djwadi's masterclass background score ?
Rhaenarya had more dragons.  But Vhagar was on the other side.
Sunfire... i hate you!!! Omg! This looks great!
Goosebumps
Falto mas escenas donde muestren dragones .-.
Hopefully there are variations to the dragons i.e.. 4 legged or twin headed etc
I have been hearing things.  If you guys are going to make this about oppression and other woke nonsense you will FAIL
Idk but during this trailer i got emotional with goosebumps.
Lol black Targaryens. Sure.
Fire and Blood!
Whispering cgi = trailer
All this fighting over a stupid throne.
is the night king gonna be in these series ???
Hmmm everything about this is perfect. Except for the obvious tokenism in R swapping already established characters in the books. I hope they at least play a role that shows they are not just a R swap for the sake of it.
Hermoso 😍❤️
Looks like the rings of power
This looks amazing.
I am not sure either I am the only one or anyone else feels the same that this more of look like throne thirsty content.
Visually looks ok, but I’m pretty sure most have moved on. Also the terrible taste of the last 2 season of GoT are still there.  I’ll sit this one out
Tbh i want a more politics based show like got in the first seasons, after season 4 it got too action-y, it lost what separated it from other franchises. If people want medieval action we already have lotr
I can't watch this after how they ruined seaon 8. HBO put their stamp of aproval on that lackluster season. I'll binge watch this when I can do it on a free-trial.
I think they used Dragonrend and Bend will shouts to tame these dragons and bring into reality .
My Dragons are back ❤❤❤❤❤
The casting was so good in GOT and from the looks of it very good in this.
Well, this looks marginally better than the new LotR series trailer, but that’s not saying much.
I wonder if there be White Walkers.....maybe in Flash backs, Ned said there hasn't been any White Walkers for Thousands of years,  Maybe they have a Whole Different Sequel about the White Walkers.
If ASOIAF, and GoT the show, had stuck to Medieval Fantasy Political intrigue like this show, it's wouldn't have gone off the rails so badly. Mixing the Knight King plot with petty squabbles made the show deeply uneven and made the ending an afterthought.
Meh
Crz
Yeah, you need to redo the end of the original series to revive interest in its world.
They are really doing the female heir story again when they did it twice in the last show? At least then the women had a chance.
The female empowerment in this one is strong!!! 3/4 of the trailer is women conspiring to gain MORE power. That's a first 😂
After GoT finished (lousily), I said I wasnt going to watch a new or side version. Truth be told, this one looks quite well made, good acting and it feels like the revived the GoT atmosphere which is great. Im gonna give it a chance!
Man, I was the biggest Song if Ice and Fire fan. This show looks wack, unless they show blackfyre, but I doubt it
Where did they find actual Dragons for filming?
Maybe there will be more dragons in this series instead of flacid penises.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
God im so excited for this than Lord of the rings!!
Will you be releasing a dragon cut of the show where we only see the scenes with dragons and skip everything else?
I like lion, deer, and wolf but not dragon. They are too powerful
These Targs are a really interesting family. I'd be really interested to see how the line finally ends up many years down the road, I'm sure its unreal.
Does it matter now? They killed Daenerys. Don't feel like watching this knowing their legacy just crumbled because of rush finale ending
They always find new ways to crush our hearts. The dragons looks like cheap CGI and rubber models.  Goodness me, why can't they do it perfectly.    As Soldier boy would say it's a cheap fooking knock off
I still have a bitter taste from GoT Season 8. We’ll see. I’d rather watch the ‘Shame’ lady follow around the writing staff
Standard woke culture. Female gets a spin off. Men are bad etc etc
OKAYYY...FINE. I'll give it a chance. Please don't disappoint me
This Show Looks, Sounds and is way Better then Game of Thrones....  So will there be a remake of Game of Thrones, or will they bring Daenerys Targaryen back to life and continue the Story for a Couple more Seasons,  That would be Great........
How much did it cost to get bots to write comments on your video ?
This is going to flop just like The LoTR series.
meh, I'm still suffering the mediocrity of the GoT ending season.
We Wuz targaryens N Shiet
I am pretty honest and this hurts my heart, as a huge GoT-Fan and slightly more LotR-Fan: This looks so much better, realer,  more serious and exciting, than the Amazon LotR-Series 😭🎭😍 Amazes me on one side, makes me sad on the other
Got
and it'll have a crap ending...
House of the Dragon > Rings of Wokes🤫
… I can’t fap to this.
I am way more excited for Rhaenys then any other character in this show. 1:27 The queen who never was!! 😭 she too lost the throne because she's a woman.
i beg they don't stuff it
I have very low expectations but I’ll wait and see
looks trash
Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I wish HBO Max would go back to selling their subscription on Prime Video.
Looks incredibly meh
Skeptical
Hic Sunt Dracones
Whoever did the casting did a great job, they all fit in well.
Aren't the Targaryens supposed to be White?  Am I going crazy?  Why is nobody pointing this out?
If the two schmucks who ruined game of thrones are involved I'll pass
Can you make the dragons more realistic please? I love the first game of thrones full of different cultures which made me criying at the end! The writer is a monster!!
Yeah! Let's hope it doesn't crash and burn like GoT.
I cant even finish watching the trailer, i just dont care anymore. I wish we got the books.
I can’t get behind this because the ending of GoT was soooooo horribly awful!
Women central movies are never worth watching
I really hope they didnt just condense Viserys and Alicent's children into just Aemond Targaryen, only seeing him in the trailers makes me worried for the story, they need all characters mentioned in Fire and Blood, that means Aemond's older and younger brothers or else the tale falls apart.
Dear HBO, don't fck up like Netflix does. You know, gay suff and n*gga stuff or else i'll unsubscribe you too
I love how they added the shot of a sword sticking out of the throne a little bit, and a little blood from the kings hands on the throne
YEEEEESSSSS this looks so good. Great cast. I hope that D & D are nowhere near this show and that HBO will not make the same mistakes with really really bad writing!!
The dreams are manipulations by the Three-Eyed Raven, in a long chess game to become king.
The dragons all look unique which will be great for adding personality and telling them apart. The GOT dragons were identical except for colour and horn design but their horns were inconsistent between episodes. Sometimes they curved upwards, sometimes downwards. These ones look much better quality.
This trailer makes the series look very limited and boring. hopefully its just a bad trailer
I think this is bull…. but people will watch it!
GET READY TO BOW DOWN AND WORSHIP HBO ALL OVER AGAIN PEOPLES!!!! LONG LIVE HBO!!!!!
LONG LIVE ANYTHING THAT IS: GAME OF THRONES!!!!!
YESSSS!!!!!!
All the budget went for dragon CGI and it seems nothing was left for the script
Trailer looks good. Being told twice in one trailer that men would never allow a woman to sit on the throne has killed most of the hope I had. This message was also in the first trailer.
I hope the Velvet Underground got paid for Venus in Fur
Everything is looking amazing and the music is badass. The only regret I have is that this is not available to stream in 4K/1440p.
Lou Reed - Venus in Furs
Excited to see all these plots twists play out!! 😁
It's just ok.
"No queen has ever sat the iron throne" Boi, only five people have at this point.
So hyped for this! Love the dragons' designs and Daemon Targaryen 🔥
Please be bloody awesome😍😍😍
Is this gonna be a new episode every week or how is it gonna be released?
This show has big shoes to fill, but it’s gonna be pretty damn good
I'm kinda excited kinda scared to learn the truth on Daemon and Rhaenyra's relationship 🥲
You can never create such magic GOT seasons 1-7 were
so its a womens show now? that sucks🤷‍♂
Akhirnyaaaaaaa
Wow
Why is there a black guy in game of thrones ?
Season 7 and 8 were so bad I’m kind of out on the entire universe.  It’s kind of what the prequels for Star Wars did to my SW fandom.
اخ اعظم رواية بالدنيا
بيكون اقوى مسلسل
عظيييييمممممم والله
Looks like they are just trying to capitalize on the Daenerys story of the last series.  This may be the story they should have told between John Snow and Daenerys Targaryen instead of ending it so early.
I love Dragons.
Where’s the dragon theme? Bring back the original soundtrack 🥲
Was that last dragon they showed Vhagar?!?!
So like at 0:57 for the soundtrack did they just note for note rip off "Venus in Fur"  by Velvet Underground?
I at least hope we get a flashback of Balerion, I want to see his black and red fire breath.
Trailer looks very good but can I just say Milly Alcock is so attractive imo
When I see only positive comments, it makes me wonder how just much deletion and  positive comment bombing is going on. Whether you like this show or not, the internet is rarely united in joy behind anything
Wow
Who is the black targaryren
looks better than lotr =)
Doesn’t Matt look just like Vigo the Carpathian from Ghostbusters?! It’s uncanny!
Waiting  🥺❤🇱🇰
The dialogue is horrendous. 2 minutes and 1/2 of feminist and woke cringe... ugh.
Why would I watch this show when the ending of the last show was crop and the author does not care to finish GOT series. Not gonna get invested in a woke show,
ok that's pretty pog
Looks pretty BORING.
terrible casting
Black Corlys?!??!
Hopefully it's good if not it will not get season 2.
looks like the velaryons are better ironborn than the HBO iroborn
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I'm crying for game of thrones. Can't wait to watch 😭😭😭.. game of thrones is still in some corner of our  hearts ..
Costumes, visuals, dragons, casting.. all looks perfect, fingers crossed the story is as such🤞
2 .15 to 2.30 mnts music ghoosbump... 👍👍

Most awaited series of all time
This looks incredible, I got chills, damn!
I think it could rival the first series Game of thrones , or really get close, for me it will depend on the acting and not the dragons .
⬅️⬅️⬅️⬅️⬅️⬅️🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦
what was the name of the largest dragon in the series again?
I thought they were going to remake the last season, what is this trash?
It’s going to be so much better than I thought 💚
Another woke trash by modern Hollywood. Far-Left America is destroying entertainment for the rest of the world.
No thanks!
Meh
That’s a nice city. It’d be a shame if someone burned it to the ground 😏
Anyone know which dragon is at the end of the trailer?? I wanna say its Vhagar.
Looks interesting, but I’d rather get a story on the Starks.
Can't wait to subvert my expectations
I expect all main character to die expect as a GOT prequel should be, not some disney move where they live happily after
you can shove this sjw show up your rear hbo!
Why do I find this boring
GoT ended so badly I find myself not really caring about this.
Dance of dragons is going to be awesome
thank you
Revive danny
Plz bring got S9🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
is it movie or series?
Need more stuff like this
HOTD: A woman would not inherit the Iron Throne Cersei: LMAO
Well I'm done with HBO. I was only keeping it because I was excited for House of the Dragon but It just looks like more woke garbage.
Succession with dragons? Sign me in.
Idiots are still mad for GOT ending lol
In g.o.t the red women was about 300 years old does any one Kno if she'll be apart of the prequel
smash
More woke progressive politics shoved down are throats. No thanks.
Why is there a black Targaryen guy? Political correctness going way too far
Oh look, more woke garbage.
Ok so HBO Max has thrown the challenge to Amazon with this new spinoff of Game of Thrones. This is well made.  Certainly technically. It will be difficult to match the grand narrative that Lord of Rings Prequel seemingly offers but Games of Ratings is definitely on. What will Netflix Do ?
The crew has done a great job. I wasn’t interested before but now I want to see this
Fire will REIGN 🔥... Rule of Targaryens 🔥🔥🔥🔥🐉
its great a show finally understands that political ideologies and agenda's are more important then the actual show itself. i cant wait to be brainwashed by diversity!
Help me
the show looks really interesting and i've read parts of the fire and blood book. I just wish Dany had a better ending :( knowing what happens to her and drogon flying off makes me sad.
Please
King r back
I love dragons!….   Dragon my nuts on this comment section
1:33 sounded just like Khaleesi
Trailer looks good. However, the showrunner interview in Hollywood reporter pretty much confirms theyre gunna butcher it to cram modern intersectional American politics in there.
A show about women fighting over the iron throne that is a prequel to a show where in the end, two women fought over the iron throne. How is this different from the last two seasons of GOT?
Black Valyrians lol…
Essa série vai ser incrível! 100% empolgado! A abertura da série também deve ser incrível igual a de GOT!
Everything looks tip top - but the dragons look absolutely horrendous.
Rise up again GOT die heart fans ❤️😏
I hope writer staff is bot same as original series. We all know how they butchered the show after book content finished
respect to HBO superb mind blowing
Not going to waste any of my life watching this, not after season 8. Do yourself a favour and don't even give this a chance.
Looking good, keep it real guys!! just a tip, stay close to the books (y)
I HOPE THEY GONNA TELL US WHAT HAPPENED TO JON. THE DUDE WAS LOVED BY THE WILDING MORE THAT HIS OWN PEOPLE. HE WAS A NO ONE AND DID ANY THING FOR EVERYONE. THATS WHY THE WILDING LOVED HIM.
It’ll be interesting to see between this and The Lord of the Rings the Rings of Power which one will be better
gunna be awsome doctor who riding a dragon lol
Family Tree Of Daenyrys Targaryen: 1. Aerys Targaryen(Mad king) Father 2. Jaehearys Targaryen (Grand Father) 3. Aegon V Targaryen  4. Maekar I Targaryen  5. Daeron II Targaryen  6. Aegon IV Targaryen  7. Vesyrus II Targaryen  8. Daemon Targaryen (Father) & Raenyra Targaryen (Mother) 9. Viserus I Targaryen (Raenyra Targaryen(Daughter)) Daenyrys Targaryen is the 9th Gen of Viserus I Targaryen
Looks bad
I like a brutal ending. Let there be fire
House of the Woke. What a pile of rubbish.
This looks like they hired disney kids. Dosnt look very good at all.
I actually wanted to see the series that revolved around the city of valyria but this seems cool too,I'll definitely be watching illegally(ain't nobody paying for HBO)
Sorry but no thanks. You already ruined GoT. After watching this trailer, I am now sure I am not interesting to HBO's GoT series anymore.
Yeah, this looks undeniably good.
Please dubbed in Hindi
Nice
I have never understood this whole GOT universe hype. It looks so bad.
dear HBO, you have not finished the first series. we got 3 seasons worth of content in 8 episodes. we dont want your prequel.
Fire will reign and the Dragons will dance!
Please, PLEASE let this be as good as seasons 1-5 of GOT. Don’t let this be 6-8
what about the white walkers?
Ok I’m hyped now
Oh my God oh my God oh my God
Wish I could get into a comma, wake up 8 years later to find it at the seventh season 😫 ❤
Way better than the stupid Lord of the rings new Trailer
Is HBO max the only streaming platform for this show. It's not available in Australia sadly, any help would be appreciated
Let's just hope this will not have the end as worse as the last one.
Where's the psychological horror movies ? movies like inception , interstellar and so on
This gonna be a best series of this year Means all time best   Humble request to HBO plz dubbed this in hindi 🙏 And GoT too
Crazy thing is this actually happens with the British throne, for hundreds of years until in the 1600s they established a blood line order
No thanks remake season 8 first.
Surely I’m not the only one that thinks long haired Daemon looks like Legolas, right? 😂
Aegon💓
Lol all these bots and shills with their "can't wait", "epic!", "I am happy that "random info" is etc,etc..."  You people are soulless and shameless and make me want to puke.
Main 💕💕🔥🔥👈YouTuber huin Mera channel se sports mil raha hai 🔥🔥🔥👈
1:48 is that balerion ? This dragon is so huge
So many witchers in one movie cant wait.
meh
A blond dragon?……. Sweet!!!!!!!!!!🤗
Meh...
Why are they forcing black people into a people that were all white and golden haired, oh wait democrats
I'm not excited but I'll still watch the first few episodes.. am I still upset about season 8? Absolutely.
Oh great, a black Targaryen. Cause that makes total sense 🤡
Agenda agenda agenda
I really wished they started this prequel from Aegon The Conqueror first, and showed how him and Rhaenys and Visenya left Valyria to Westeros and conquered and United the 7 kingdoms. And do time jumps from season to season.  Or make and Animated version of it Idk. It would be really cool to see
Omg. Aren’t we all waiting for the theme of house of the dragon made by ramin dijwadi. No doubt it’s gonna be epicccc
What clowns you are. Amazon is laughed at, Netflix is laughed at, and so are you. Can you even think with your head? The Targaryens have a clear definition, white hair and face. WHY do they have dark-skinned people in their bloodline? I'm so sick of you and your summons.
More hyped for this than Rings Of Power.
Very epic and full of intrigue just as one would hope for!
Can't wait!
Oh man, the music is already too good
I love dragons♥️ this series will come with everything
I feel conflicted . I can't bring myself to watch G.O.T cos of the way it was 'wrapped up' at the end , yet this looks to have the same vibe and looks pretty good...hmmm
Looks pretty good ngl
Sounds like Jenny of Oldstones
This looks pretty great, I hope it lives up to the hype. Can’t wait to watch it!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Dracarys!
Its grobin time
Trujillo and Cáceres for the win! So good to see them on screen.
Sad reality is the viewing score will not be as high as the ori GoT. Too much casual viewers parish along with its last season and HoD prob trying to milk the series too fast by churning it out now as wounds have not heal yet. I think it would have been better if they could kick the two clown and replace them with a few best known author with martin's guidance to make a patch up sub series to explain in detail logically what lead up to the whole story to at least beautify it so minimize the wound before moving on to HoD project would have rebuild the lost trust casual had within the GoT universe.
房子裡的龍嗎????
I love that pale, blond/silver haired and purple-eyed Velaryon!! Oh, wait! Oh.. diversity card, cool! Can't wait for the next Black Panther starring Christian Bale!
Sorry...Drogon..Viserion... Rhaegon ALL looked far better than these cartoonish versions of dragons...  These look like they belong in an amusement park
If I don't see this much overwhelming amount of dragon in the show, I an not watching. And I'll tell everyone who hasn't see this that it sucks.
Target 1k subscribe Karo Bhai
I hope there is at least some comedic element. this all seems very serious and full of pathos
*House of the Woke.   There, I fixed it.
Can hardly wait...
Did they put a black actor whit blond hair and pretend to be a targerian?
well ik how this will go, no ty
mhmm... seems like woke crap.
Too little, too late. The total car crash of season 8 of GoT has ruined hype of the franchise for most fans  Let it go HBO.. you messed up.. move on
Allicent Hightower, looks like a dark horse, a hero born in the flames.... I'm kidding, did you see her face? sheesh
OMG I can't wait!!!! I already love it!!!!
Chillsss 🥶
If we get The Battle Above Gods Eye this whole show will be so worth it.
കളി കാണുവോ 😌
I like prequels when stories are well connected. This is not the case, in GOT the whole premise about dragons was that they were rare and dead for a thousand years, it looks they were more common and recent to what GOT story told us
My god this looks bad. Hard pass
I guess the dozens of times people in Game of Thrones said dragons have been dead for thousand years were deluded
After what they did to Season 8 of GOT, I am not at all excited about this.
Honestly after GoT season finale I'm either waiting for the end of the series before watching it, so that I can read reviews or just skipping this. HBO pissed me off royally with GoT, one of the best series of all time which was totally ruined at the end!
i can already tell that this movie's gonna tank.. going go down like the titanic
Finally, my watch can begin again.
Targereans are fair skinned, blonde har with purple eyes.....now they have dreadlocks, dark skin and dark eyes.....  Why do show writers insist on ignoring the lore to suit left wing propaganda......:/.
🔥🥵🥵
I hope they don't kill main characters this time🤣
Seems like game of thrones for women
Underwhelming to say the least.
Still cannot get over the fact they made Corlys Velaryon black. My lord does he look out of place and destroys my immersion.
caraxes!
Not interested, get same bad vibes from this as I did with rings of power...
Without Tyrion lanister this series is going to flop.
Phoebe Bridgers should have been casted
Oooof, that's a shame...
Blond or white hair and dragons. Where did i see that before.
I would watch this but season 8 of got still haunts me. What a way to ruin a series.
All of this to have epic backstory just to have Bran sit on the Iron Throne. It's like a dramatic build up to a tragedy that was GOT Season 8. Nonetheless, I hope they'd make up for what a mess they made in the final season of GOT with this. I just hope that there won't be too much shoehorned PC culture stuff in this series as the books and the world of GOT are as cruel as they could be and it would be a great amount of disrespect from the source material if they change things just because "Oof, offensive wuhuhu."
Hold ur horses finally disaster to all other webseries is coming.....
Mind boggling BGM 🔥🔥🔥
Are there multiple dragons already? The one shown as flying looks so much like Drogon of GoT. And the ones shown in close ups has a different face n aura.. 🤔
Meh. Not sure I’m interested
All this time I was under the impression it was a series about Robert's Rebellion, but here it's a just a family drama series about the Targaryens..
Can't wait 🔥
damn is that milo?
It's gonna be at least 10 times worse than GoT season 8!!! Mark my words!!!!!!!!!!
HOPE     we fans  attach with character emotionally like  in games of thrones arya sansa cersie sam and others. I am impatient to see this series
Which Dragon is that guys?
This is perfection.  I loved The Rogue Prince and The Princess and the Queen books.  This is the books come to life.  I am the happiest I have been for a long time.
1:27 So we’re doing this again? 🙄 🥱 😴 Boringggg Paaaass 👎
Please teach these people to make real liquid fire!!! That's the second series we're going to watch that has this poor fire VFX. Just watch the Reign of Fire and learn for god's sake.
Dang. LOTR looks pretty average and this doesn't look any better. Seems like the only shows with grand scope are just spin offs. We need something new.
I hope we get to see flashbacks of Balerion, maybe of when Viserys rode him in his younger days
🙃🙂Oh Yeah! Can’t wait not long to go…..Yepeeeeeeeee😁😆🥳
Hindi me ayegi ye series???
house of lamisters ?
The theme slaps. I hope they use it in the show
The music sounds like "shiny boots of leather" by Velvet Underground
meh
I hope it's going to be better than the last two seasons of GoT. Whoever made these should never again work in the film industry.
Well... at least it looks better then the rings of power.
Please release in hindi also  We always support you Love from india ❣️
A prequel to my favorite TV show of all time :) And this looks really promising, they recaptured the atmosphere perfectly in this trailer. The dragons look amazing too. Glad to be back in the world of Game of Thrones.
All these characters look like inbreds, they look boring, uninteresting and weak, they definitely could've casted more interesting looking actors.
Alright. Wheres the woke?
Hmmm yeah i don't know 🤷🏻‍♂️
لا شكلنا داخلين على حاجة تقيل
I’m a very simple man. I see Matt Smith, I watch.
I see they took the Black Party of House Targaryen quite literally for some
Why don't you remake season 8 instead, especially the battle of Winterfell? It was a disaster.
So they also join Woke morons,feminists and to them is more important to send a message against Men...
I haven’t read the Targaryen book. How many Dragons are there going to be in this one?
"If you think this has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention."  — Ramsay Bolton to Theon Greyjoy
Omggggggggggggggggggg
Is it all now about women winning the power?. Last time I checked they f**ked up really bad in game of thrones.
"When I'm queen, I will create a new order" reminds me of someone haha
Did anyone notice cersi?
I love how the red dragon sort of resembles Smaug from the Hobbit 🐉🐲
Just to let you know I’m team black 🤭🍸
Yeah not watching this... after the mess of the last season of GoT and then hearing you race and gender swapped people and said because you wanted Less White people!! Yeah not watching anything from hbo ever again
Lmao
Mejor pinta que el señor de los anillos. Que no es mucho decir
Season 8 destroyed the entire franchise.  I'd rather watch paint dry.
12th Century England (with dragons).
Well when the first of the trailers came out I thought nah its gunna be crap like most spin offs . But this actually looks good , I wonder if the white walkers will make some sort of an appearance
Gggg.. Geralt of Rivia. Is that you?
This gon be the most annoying thing with all these pathetic references to feminism and inclusiveness
I hope this is good and no woke bs content.
This trailer was good, then I read the comments made in interviews and lost faith…
This would be a masterpiece !! damnnn
D&D ruined only a few last seasons of GoT but these luneticts somehow managed to ruin the whole show before it even came out. Congratulations.
Surely if this the history of the Targaryens shouldn’t it start before the iron throne was made?
Targaryens against Targaryens, Dragons against Dragons🔥🔥🔥
is the original writer involved ? cos... if not... I fear it's just going to fan fiction. and possibly you know what kind of fan fiction.
So this is Succession, but with dragons

So this series is about the Dance of Dragons? I also saw Daemon, so is it also about Blackfyre?
1:09 is this Lord commander Ser Ryam Redwyne ?
Can't wait to see this 😁😁
Why are all the actors so ugly ? Compared to the original they seem like they just picked these people up off the street
Looks like it's going to be a big fail. The characters are weak as the actors that play them. The real spirit and atmosphere of GOT is lost..
Ok. I've been quite sceptical, but now I'm little hyped. It looks great. As long as they haven't butchered the story, it'll be good.
I don't get most of the comments. "It looks so good, stunning visuals, the amount of work went into it, even looks better and bigger than GoT!" You act like the problem with GoT was that it looked bad. This show needs brilliant writing, charismatic, strong leads, and good directing. I have very low expectations at this point, maybe its gonna be good, but quite possibly its just gonna have dragons and battles and explosions and awkward dialogues
this like rings of power is boring numb trash
Woke trash
Hindi me aayegi kya bhai
Black people
While I will certainly miss some of the actors from the original series, I'm crossing my fingers that this series will not disappoint. I'm still angry about what D&D did to my favorite show.
blah, cgi dragons...
please do not kill those dragons,.. i cant bare seeing one fall again,. RIP Vyserion and Rhaegal
I don't know why, it doesn't have the hype like the previous GOT. Season 8 ruined it all.
Maybe once all of the seasons are complete.  Not going to risk my time on this franchise after what they did to it last time.
Another sjw garbage
Remake the last episode of GoT in different plot!
Let's hope it's gonna be as phenomenal as s08 was!
Will Arya stark reach West of Westeros in last season of House of the Dragon?
I really hope hbo made this show in 4k HDR
Putting myself firmly in the mindset that this is a prelude alternate universe majorly different from canon-show GOT: ok, ok that looks cool.   (Feeling sad that I’m more hype about this than the LOTR one rip)
Watched half, got excited, stopped to avoid spoilers
For every episode,trailer(GOT special season 8 ) background sound provided by team is very interesting and beautiful.i listen again and again i like it.
More cowbells!! We need more cowbells,ffs! And dragons 🐉🐉🐉
I've read the book and it's a pity that I can't see Jaeherys's reign. There's a whole chapter with Jaeherys and Alysanne that producers didn't take into account. Maybe because it was too long. You would love these characters.
Rings and dragons rules this August
🔥🔥🔥🔥
❤️❤️❤️
As an ex-hardcore Game of Thrones fan, I’ll dedicatedly and passionately hate on this one for how the original panned out and wasted everyone’s time. I deem this franchise beyond repair.
meh
Wow 3rd season of Witcher looks amazing!!!
I think we are being made fool here, GOT Ep1 start 1st 10 mins was the real danger till the end - the Night King & no matter what, that story was more Core to the Entire series then Lanisters. We haven't actually saw in the trailers what will be civilization ending threat in House of Dragons & im thinking without it, it might not succeed as GOT did.
So just watch everything apart from the last episode and it will be fantastic.
Like I suspected,  only thing worth while in targaryeans is the civil war, the music is brilliant....but I don't have any hope left for this
As long as Dumb and Dumber are not involved in the writing, I count that as a win already!
this is just dumb I mean whatever I'm being told I'm only to assume all the dragons die only to be three left for what we know as the end series of got and yes a woman will sit on the iron thrown only to be killed by her lover boy/family member  awh and everything they are fighting about in terms of power eg drangons die and the final big whatever is the knight king who gets killed by arie the faceless like really....really
please follow the book material closely and we have a deal.
OK, I'm officially hyped!
ഇത് നുമ്മ പോളിക്കും
Lets hope she doesnt forget shes at war!
I guess I am the only one who thinks this looks underwhelming. Or they are deleting the negative comments.
😌
Millet hbo max alsin direkt izlesin biz de 30 günlük bedava vpn deneye deneye sürünelim. Rezillikten başka bir şey değil.
HBO MAX in India??
Hope they release all the episodes at ones
🔥🔥I am YouTuber 🔥🔥🔥 🔥🔥मैं YouTuber हूं🔥🔥🔥 🔥🔥🔥 mera vlog channel hai🔥🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥मेरा ब्लाग चैनल हैं🔥🔥🔥 ❤️❤️❤️❤️Mera Channel se aapka help kya ho sakta hai ❤️❤️❤️❤️
World best show is back
*Man this looks beautiful! The acting, the visuals, the dragons, the costumes, the designs. ugh, everything looks stunning!! *
Oh my God
This is gonna be FIRE🔥
I am ready for more dragons. I want em all 🥰🥰🥰
I'll pass. This is like giving Ur abusive partner a 2nd chance , they say they have changed but they havnt. And u would be foolish to think they have.  No doubt lazy writers with rushed productions.
Hindi trailer
Red flags everywhere. Pass.
Thanks...I hate it.
Obviously they found a way to use black actors for Targaryans.. Hollywood. Must die
Can't wait!!!!!
HOTD: A woman would not inherit the Iron Throne Cersei: LMAO
Targaryen hair hurts my eyes
For everyone who has their hopes up this could actually be a good show just check out some of the interviews with the showrunners
Didn’t they say in GOT that Cersei was the first woman to sit on the iron throne? And if so that kinda gave it away that the brother is going to win and not the daughter in HOD???
Another pile of women empowerment and diversity heading for our throats.
So dumb and dumber are gone right?
Better than LotR Amazon.. Wish HBO had won the bidding on LOTR series.
Some out of context dragon clips and nothing else
The Dance of Dragons
I’ve missed Game of Thrones so much , this will definitely fulfill my thirst for the lore
Next House of Lannister.
Was missing Game of Thrones lore
The one thing I have to look forward to this summer
I thought they already didn't want to continue the series
Where is my favorite actors?
can’t wait to be thought a lesson about my white male privilege, and about how women and black people are better than me at everything and that i should hate myself
I'm so happy that we get girl power in 2022. So original.
Vhagar vs Caraxes. Daemon vs Aemond. Coming Soon.
I want to see more dragon fight 😎
Can't wait for her to go mad, burn it all, and ruin the final season
not bad...
I see a lot of ancestors of the people we already knew. Even for the dragons.
GOT disappointed me so much, I can't bring myself to watch this.
cringe
lots of TV series coming up in the next few months geez
Meh, feels like watching repeats  We all know how it ends. GOT season 8 ruined the franchise
Bunch of POCs wandering around and breaking canon, lore and playing with intersectional feminism. Another franchise killed.
Tbh this trailer didn't capture me, but I hope the movie will be way better.
I don't know this series. Neither game of thrones. But one thing I can tell, Incest is coming.
How about casting some decent looking actors
Looks pretty bad.
Lol, what's up with the black dude with blonde dreads!!!
We're Still Not Cured From The Wounds That We All "GOT"   Dont Be Messedup This Time !
After S8 of thrones I'm just not interested frankly.
Pretty underwhelming. Nice soundtrack tho
Did anyone notice a huge dragon foot ? 😱
My YouTube channel hae 🔥🔥 मेरा यूट्यूब चैनल है 💖💖 My Tage Channel hae 🔥🔥 मेरा टेग चैनल है 💖💖My Channel Se Aapki Halep Hoo Sektee He 🔥🔥 मेरा चैनल से आपकी हेल्प हो सकती है 🔥🔥
Not watching this until 10 years later when I know if the writers had given up on it
Oh. Goody. Another far left gender affirmation of gender and ethnicity swapping sure to be a garbage show. Because HETEROSEXUAL, WHITE MAN BAD, of course. Just like the Lord of the Ring’s Amazon garbage being pumped out of these, well, garbage studio’s. Hard pass on these “Get Woke, Go Broke” studio’s. Please have a fantastic day.
What’s up with all this woman rule everything mess? So a man can’t be king anymore?
Everyone in this trailer looks like geralt of rivia
Oh okay this is the first time since that finale we don't talk about that I actually feel hyped about anything GoT related. Amazing trailer, even better than the LotR amazon trailer
Jesus, the traffic on this trailer is insane
What a mess...
Excited 😭😍😂
it's gonna tank.
I'm not impressed with the Targaryen's wigs and hairstyling in this so far. GOT had a better quality of wigs and hairstyles for them. They should have hired the same team. The Velaryon's hairstyle I'm sorry but it looks ridiculous to me. I  hope they'll improve it if they get season 2 greenlit.
Do one where everyone speakers with Australian accent.
Will this drop on Amazon Prime on the same day or they will delay it.
Nice video
Thanks HBO for telling the whole story in the trailer
Black targaryen 💀
seems like they start full on feminism this time
War...never changes
For a super uncomfortable and ungodly-sighted throne, people are really dying over each other to sit on it.
I'm probably the only one who sees a cat's face in the dragon's nose in the thumbnail
Wonder if they loved starbucks back then too
Ffs HBO!!! You allowed the destruction of the greatest ever series and now you bring this anti male drivel...
Jesus, another feminist tv show. That chick looks like she's doing an impression on Daenerys
lol no thanks. HBO completely ruined the franchise with those pitiful last seasons, and ESPECIALLY the last one. What a disgrace.
Ok I am in 🙂
dont disappoint us like GOT
The fact they even think I’m gonna watch this after what they did to GOT is a sick joke
Why does the trailer seem clunky?
Need Hindi dubbing 🇮🇳
MORTAAL KOMBAAAT!!!
MILK IT 🥛
Need some stark shining as well
Waiting for Hindi trailer
So, it's an adaptation of the Princess and the Queen?
This is going to be woke trash.
Seems promising but GOT final season disappointment still fresh
looks bad
seriously this series promises to be one of the greatest and surpass GOT not only because of the story but because it seems to be well built and made like dragons people this is amazing too beautiful too surreal
My god…superb trailer eagerly waiting for aug 21
The ending to GOT was so bad that I’m not even remotely excited for this show. Which saddens me since I still consider GOT my favorite series despite what happened
*Netta*  The bestest person in the whole wide galaxy.
WE WUZ TARGEEEYYREAAANZ N SHIEEEEEEEEEET
From the acclaimed writer of... Rampage xD
Cool. Season 8 still sucks though.
is this trailer consists of full seasons or just one?  seems like season 1 ending full dance of dragons
I quit watching GOT after Shireen's death, and from everything seen and heard that was a good decision on my part. This looks like it could be a good series, but I still have a few concerns. Mostly just worried they turn the complex characters into something uninteresting.
Mad respect to HBO for using real dragons instead of CGI like in Game of Thrones. I hope everyone is safe during filming.
This is gonna be extremely generic and bland calling it now
This looks badass. The actual canon from George RR Martin regarding these events is fascinating.  If they get this right, this show will be awesome.
Is there a sequel called enter the dragon?
Hindi dubb?
Hindu dubb??
Mera  Rashi Creation YT channel hai
🔥🔥I'm YouTube par ho 🔥mire channel ha 🥰Rashi Creation YT 🔥
meh
is that based on a specific book?
Oh my god, that's Venus in Furs playing in the background.
The soundtrack is amazing!
Eh. Where's the dance of the dragons? Just a few seconds glimpse of that would've made the entire trailer much more better IMO. Though I must say, the armors are really looking top notch! Hopefully the increased budget reflects that consistently and the directors this time. NO excuse for altering the storyline for the worse because there's already an established source!
All new story, all new characters. Looks interesting. Let's see how it goes.
down hill this will be
I feel like I've seen this story..
Comes out 3 days after my birthday. I cant wait!!!!!!!
Is it the story before lanister and barathon about madking?
Está compitiendo contra los chistes de dungeons & dragón y contra los pioneros de la fantasía medieval el Anillo de Poder !
It’s like going back to an abusive lover. Here we go again…..
More like Game of Woke, why are there black targaryans lol.
Each and every dragon have unique look it shows there breed
Looks good, too bad the story eventually leads to nothing in 200 years in the future of this story.
Venus and furs ☺️
I think the trailer song will be the intro to House of Dragon. Got the same epic feel as GoT one.
Ya ya anyway ..waiting for House of Wolves sequel
Plzzz we need to hindi dubbed plzz
ill give it a chance but looks like pure woke trash, real chick flick...a woke chick flick i mean.
Floppity flop flop
This looks amazing. Praying it keeps being amazing all the way to the end.
yeah no thanks
This looks really good!!
Soooo a black Targaryen? I'm betting it was a white person who wanted this.
Prepare for grey characters. Not really any heroes and villains in this story
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩😎👌😎😎❤️❤️❤️
Ну хз-хз... Наверняка будет толерантная хрень без мата, сисек и убийств основных уже полюбившихся персонажей. Вместо этого разведут розово-фиолетовые сопли а-ля  Санта-Барбара про женские феминистические переживания и их тонкую душевную организацию.
In the midst of a global conflict what the world really needs is some extra  motivation to get things started eh?
The great thing about stationery shops is they're always in the same place...
Would love to be interested, but considering how GoT ended.......meh
I am beyond glad that Ramin Djawadi returned for this!
Can't wait to get disappointed in the final season.
Is this a prequel?
Avoid until George is done with Song of Ice and Fire or we will never get Winds of Winter, let alone complete the series.
dany said there had never been a queen on the throne didn't she?

looks bad
Whooooouuiooo
Where is Lord Baelish, who spice up the things ? 😂 and I miss Tyrion as well, can we have their cameo ?
Make a special series on Jaqen H'gar. He was the most enigmatic character in GOT. It was sad he was not in last 2 seasons. So many mysteries were surrounded around him. GOT didn't answer any questions about who he really was before, how he got to know about Many faced Gods, how he chose to become a Faceless man, was he first person to become No one? Why did he helped Arya Stark?
Anybody else hearing Venus in Furs in the score?
Everytime i watch this majestic tailer and its epic music , Goosebumps pops out
We want that old denarius Targarian 🥺🥺
Can’t wait to be fully obsessed with this only to be colossally letdown as it nears its end
Rhaenys should have been queen and Jaehaerys’ heir and I will die on that hill.
Cant believe Eyeball Paul is in this.   If you know you know.
Game of Wokes....
didnt fix season 8 rage quit
Is that true Jon snow and Darcy will be back on that shows?
I hope the writers don't forget to tell a good story.
💥💥💥
Matttttttt Smith
The mindblowingness returns
was this filmed with 4k cameras?
Incest full send
Eh, seems watered down, played safe. I bet there won't even be any incest.
I still can't believe the guy playing Otto Hightower is Adam Sandler's brother Adrian in Little Nicki!!
Background music?
Trailer didn't do it for me . Gotta watch it . I hope it's just as good as GOT
Please don't ruin it this time
love
I'm excited to see drogon's old family 🔥
No one gives a Fck... Never forget season 8.
I think I get it, so, no women are allowed on the Iron Throne.
Can't wait for all that nakedness
Redemption ark
meh
Okay. I'll give it a shot.
loved the deadric armor 00:42
So house Valaryan is black because they didn't want a bunch of white people on screen.  Great...
First of all, THE BUDGET WENT CRAZY ON THOSE DRAGONSS!!   Second, I really can’t wait to hear the soundtrack on this series!!!!  This Looks amazing!!! *crossfingers*
FIRE AND BLOOD!
Please dear god don’t watch this, do you not remember seasons 6-8???????
imagine the ending will be related to the GoT , where the the three dragons were projected and controlled by what they named after .
this trailer does a better job at setting things up and give you an idea of what's gonna be going on in the first season but the previous one was more simple and more epic
This looks like it’s gonna have a lot of juicy drama 👀 still has the classic GoT vibe but feels fresh
its 1mins into the trailer and its already giving off "im a strong independant woman who needs no man" vibes.
Omg I’m so hyped 🤯🤯🤯, I can’t wait
😂😂 5 years from now, it will be revolutionary to see a male lead cast a movie, game or show
Man, I really want to know how many dislikes this cash grab has.
No! U ruined it!
OMG CAN'T WAIT!! What's with all the haters???
For a moment i thought this was The Witcher trailer. So many white hair lol.
I'll admit it looks cool, BUT... how about spend a bit of the money on this project on redoing the final season of GOT and get it right this time?
Can't wait to see the dragon weiner close-up shot
Dumpster fire. Like all mainstream shows or movies of the last 5+ years it will be flooded with garbage real world ideologies that are so obviously placed that distract and ruin the story.
Why does it seem like Deamon is going to war against his WIFE?
Looks shite. Prove me wrong
Can you pls bring Jason vorhees I already saw Michael I wanna see vorhees
Honestly I'm still not over the last seasons of got. I'll pass
Just another woke tale telling fee-males they can do anything a man can do .... hard pass ... NEXT!
Honestly, this looks pretty rubbish.
This show is gonna top the original without a doubt.
nice review :) gg well played . .  @->-- #POWERGPU #Typicalgamer
Too many white people. Unable to enjoy.
Not one negative top comment huh?  Yeah sure
Can someone explain this to me? Is this a prequel of GOT?
After this amazing masterpiece please give us the Jon Snow sequel
Hope it isn't a huge letdown like GoT final season was.
Is Balerion gonna be in here?
It's woke but we lyk it
Why are people so mad about black people and women having power in this show? If you don't like it.. Leave the party. We don't care what you think. We will enjoy it whether you like it or not.. 😆
All of this for Bran the Broken to sit in the Iron Throne. Tsk.
I hope it's good but after season 8 of the original series I'm not going to hold my breath.  I'll just wait and see how it goes.
This looks like it will be very boring!  Every man that's in the trailer, will be killed by a woman by the 4th episode.
Hey it’s Milo
Loved GoT…until season 8.  This looked like fun;  then I read the Show Runner comments. House of Woke (now with dragons!). I think I’ll pass.
Feeling pretty underwhelmed......perhaps it will be better than this preview.
Maybe I wont need a torch to see what's going on this time?
I'm here for the Dragons
Uga buga chimped Corlys.
I have never seen such disgusting Dragon ...
It's woke but they dnt hate on it as much as ring of power fan of the 2
Affirmative action Feminist garbage!
I am sooooooo ready for August 21st and GOT-HOD.
Yeah Slay Queen!!! 🤩😍🥰
It seens to be as good as GOT final season.
Why they have to bring diversity and feminism in everything. Stop being political all the time
Music name?
Stop the war...Can't we just all get along? 😮‍💨
I see the series includes a Black-a-more (SNL reference).
"The world is very different now than it was 10 years ago when [Game of Thrones] all started. It's different than 20 years ago when Peter Jackson made The Lord of the Rings. These types of stories need to be more inclusive than they traditionally have been". ""It was very important for Miguel and I to create a show that was not another bunch of white people on the screen, just to put it very bluntly."  Ryan Condal and Miguel Sapochnik everybody. These 2 morons among others (we know who they are)  are the ones destroying the entertainment, because THE MESSAGE is more important than a proper adaptation.
NO.
I am woman hear me roar... Oh please give me a break
Dragons look like really cheap CGI lmao. Knew this would be yet another dumpster fire. Anyone who is excited for this and/or still likes GoT after the abysmal ending is a unbelievable chump with not an ounce of taste.
i really enjoy the first and mid season of GOT but somehow the last season really scarred me for life about the franchise lol, but hey with these its a win in my book, dragons > anything else
I got a feeling that this is gonna bomb
Don't get your hopes up. Every single prequel,sequel to any great franchise (disney/non disney.....coz the mouse has eaten almost everything) since the pandemic has been sjw woke fest.
I'm loving this ❤️
as long as those 🤡s who ruined GOT are nowhere near this we good.
Hair
Ok
*This has pleased the Many-Faced God*
Meh, looks boring to me.  I see the focus is still about keeping the woman down.  Too bad they couldn't come down out of the woke cloud and be a bit more original.  But I guess we are going to beat this horse for a while longer.
They can do better lmao or was season 5 of GoT the last good thing we'll get from HBO
You know what time is it?!  It is morbin time...   -probably one of the dragons
back when Europe was European
Maybe we don't get the ending of this like GOT 😂
The music??
Behold factions, the Blacks and the Greens Behold the Dance, that brought a empire to its knees
Please be good!
Why make a new show instead of remaking season 7 and 8 of Game of thrones?! They should've fixed that first!
Game of Woke. 😂
Now after seeing ukrain war these scenes dont have power to attract attention 🙏
This is not R R Martin writing then why he is writer here 🙏

im going for the brother
Black dudes with blonde dreadlocks, just looks stupid. Forced diversity. Agenda - The Message - more important than realism.
Just don't go woke what ever you do. You can get any message across if you do it with out insulting a big portion of your audience  if you do it right you might get people to listen again don't underestimate or insult us please. I'm telling you now HBO once you poison the well it's done.
looks great, love the story and hopefully one day they will do one with the blackfyre (Targaryen family) rebellion.
I really wish they would have done the Flea Bottom show instead. This looks good, but at the same time we just finished with the whole dynastic/high fantasy/war torn kingdom thing. Flea Bottom could have been phenomenal. Less epic in scope and more character driven
Doubt it can make up for the horrid nonsense that was season 8 but will give it a shot
Esto va a ser épico
hopefully they redeem themselves with this show
Ma Patriarchy!! No one cares about this crap since Season 8 - and making it more “progressive” just guarantees a hard pass by most folks…
A HBO original series**** 😅
They`ll ruin it with the critical theory mold. It`s the only idea they have.
Excited to watch this, I hope they don't mess up the ending like they did with GOT if they succeeded at making the show as good as GOT.
otro exito politicamente correcto, ahora hay targarian afrodecendientes, un mal chiste que siempre faoverecen a la misma etnia en todo,  si tiene exito la serie bien por ella, pero le veo el mismo futuro que la nueva serie del señor de los anillos
Corlys Velaryon is a summer islander now? lol Just shatter the lore why don't ya
Lol black targryians now? Man — I’m gonna be glad when we move past all the political cults in this country. You got your right wing Q nutters trying to burn Democracy to the ground, and on the left identity politics chocking all creativity to fit into their religion. Neither one is a world I care to live in, and people will look back at movies and tv from this time, and laugh at the obvious cynical pandering that permeates everything.
Broke: Rhaenyra/Alicent is best girl  Woke: Vhagar is best girl
No thanks. Keep your wokey tv series. There will be plenty of simps anyway who will watch.
Some one give the wig department a bigger budget for next season
Bait and Switch television show with twisted ideology identity politics is already in full display here in this trailer. This can sit right next to that upcoming dumpster fire wannabe Lord of the Rings not a prequel television show. Honestly, your better off just watching mindless action movies like the Fast & Furious or Transformers to keep you from hearing television shows lecturing you about current day Western politics. 🤷‍♂️🤦‍♂️
omg my lord my dragon movie someone take me watch it ⚡️

I'm so excited I want to see it
YAS!!!!
Lots of gushing reviews here. Seems a bit fishy.
Another show where men are bad. Tight
Yeah, not watching this due to the forced black people
Looks promising!
watch and learn amazon
Let's be honest. We're ALL watching this solely for the dragons. 🐉🐉🐲
Wasn't cercei,bad enough
I am suing this entire cast and crew for 100 billion dollars
Can't wait
I love dragons so much. They look beautiful
Who is the villain? Game of thrones had a almost great story and a meaningful villain.
This looks incredible! So happy Dan and Dave aren't anywhere near this. Makes me wish Daenerys got the proper conclusion she deserved, smh. This show looks phenomenal
I don't understand why there's an African there
think this is already overrated.
Of all these ESTROGEN laden shows coming to streaming I think GOT has the best shot of succeeding, it at least looks like the writers are semi competent and nowing how Zaslav deals with failure I think we might just get a good show.... Matt Smith is awesome too 🤗👍
I'm not a really movie person, but this REALLY draws my attention Looks amazing!! 🔥🔥
Amoooo Vai ser surto atrás de surto
One season tops, with some cheap trick in season finale to make it seem like more is needed.
Forced diversity sucks
Por fin¡¡¡¡
Is it just me or the dragon just said war in the beginning
Too soon.  You are yet to be forgiven.
Daemon Targaryen's face really make me think of Odo from Deep Space Nine.
BAHAHAHAH a "Black" Targaren 🤣🤣🤣🤣 gotta add that "Racial Diversity" for the snowflakes
D&D can't hurt me anymore... D&D can't hurt me anymore... D&D can't hurt me anymore... D&D can't hurt me anymore...
Remake season 8 or I'm not watching anything from the franchise again.
Yikes! 9 1/2 million views and only 149K likes!
HBO Max is unstoppable,on fire!
Raenyra team 🐲🔥👑
Ok now they can't mess this up can they?
Who's that white haired dude?
is that a black targaryen?
The only thing that can slay these dragons is bad writing.
1:48 we only see it for a split second, but that's foot we see is actually Vhagar, the second biggest dragon to Balerion!  0:34 here and here's 2:30 Syrax! The yellowish one.   2:23 and... the reddish one is Caraxes, half the size of Vhagar.  2:30 might also be Vermithor
GREEAAAAT so this suddenly became women power and netflix woke too?
Not bad.
Where the white walker?
Дом негров
1:33 is that Dany’s voice? Did they use it from GOT?
Dark skinned Targaryen? 0_0
I'm afraid that it will have that same ol sickness all shows have nowadays. Forced diversity and feminist crap.
Giving me GOT feelings , Can't wait 🔥
This series is gonna Surpass Woke of the Rings: Rings of Power. Mark my words
I still can't understand who is the genius team can make this fictional story looks like real and pretty good 👌🏻
Glad to see that lady who’s in the Fate Winx reboot on netflix is getting a better gig! Anyways hope this can heal us from S8!
The dialogues sounds meh and full of doubts. I am not getting good vibes. #notexcitedforpremieremightchangemumindpostfirstseaaon
Where are the bewbs?
honestly i am just here for the Dragons
0:52 1:50 2:13 are the best parts
Hello? This is Dan & Dave. We would like to give some tips on how you can make this show good, exactly like what we did in Season 8 of GoT.
Can't wait to see half of the characters dying in the first episode only
Lord of the Rings is far superior.
I will support the claim of strong muscular Male and there is nothing you can do about it.
Class one 🥶
finish winds of winter already
What's war is a foot?
Weren't dragons like extinct or something at the beginning of GOT? for like several years.
.- je
I believe I speak for many of us... Please don't let us down, we have very high hopes for this new series ;)
Don't know why but to me without Dany, Jon snow, Little finger and Arya stark would feel like something missing and wouldn't give that much vibe
The Targaryens were actually the source of their own destruction each time..Aenys I was weak and indecisive which led to his son 'Aegon the Uncrowned' being killed and Maegor I taking the throne. If Jahaerys had listened to his wife Alysane and choose Rhaenys 'the Queen Who Never Was' as his heir or made his own decision, the dance could have been avoided, same to Viserys I. Aegon II was traumatized by dragons after the dance and didn't bother to breed more hatchlings, leading to their extinction. Aegon III legitimized all his bastards which led to the blackfyre rebellion. Aemon grandson of Daeron II 'The good' refused the throne and joined the night's watch lol. Aegon V tried to hatch the dragon eggs to revive dragons into the world but ended up causing the fire at summerhall where many Targaryens died. Aerys II 'The Mad King' became paranoid after being kidnapped making enemies of everyone and forced his wife Rhaella to have children despite complications which killed her eventually. Rhaegar Targaryen kidnapped the daughter of the warden of the North, Lyanna Stark causing a war in Westeros...Only two Targaryens were now left in the world where there were so many. Viserys and Daenerys. If only their mother Rhaella would have been alive..she would have arranged marriage alliances for them with maybe the children of the  Martells of Dorne, with Renly and Shireen of house baratheon , with Margaery and Loras of house Tyrell or with Robb and Sansa of house Stark. The dynasty would have survived. However, a dragon, alone in the world is such a terrible thing.
I'm waiting for this and LOTR series, being a big fan of both universes. But I need to say this trailer, the glimpse in acting, cinematography and atmosphere in here is miles over LOTR trailer which does not send me the chill GOT does and seems amatourish even if it has all the CGI
“For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life. (John 3:16) The bible says the wages of sin is death. Man has broken Gods moral law and has gotten the death penalty. However due to Gods mercy Jesus lived a perfect life and died on the cross for our sins to make us right with God. “Go and sin no more”-Jesus. trust in what Jesus did for you…because He loves you.
This trailer was so good.  The costumes and sets look so beautiful as was expected.  I’m hoping the story is just as good!  Can’t wait for this!
Should have just named it game of thrones 2. Plot is airily similar.
Battle of the ratings and views starts...  House of Dragons vs The Rings of Power!!!
So how all the velaryons are black and corlys has dreadlocks,this isnt in the source material
If the brothers who directed the last episode of season 8 come back...ooooo boy imma finna......!
Looks great
Black people with blonde hair 🤮 looks soo bad.
obviously another strong wamen feminist movie
That's crazy
Are you sure this is worth watching?
So are we gonna see John Snow's mother
Still believe it's too soon
If you go by the history of the Fire and Ice lore then Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen will be queen but not for very long
Looks interested, but no point getting invested in it. Not falling for the same trick twice.
Yeah good but I wanted someone like Katherine winnick or emilia again
starks had dire wolves (house sigil), Targareyens had actual dragons (house sigil), no badass lions (house sigil) for the lannisters?
This looks immensely better than the OG show. Super excited
Will there be a new trailer after this on SDCC, or is this the only one?
Tamil dubbing release request
oh man this looks good. Time to renew HBO Max subscription
Please release in hindi language
Please release in hindi
This’ll have to be so good to wash the crap taste out of my mouth from the last season of Game of Thrones ,the bar is way too high for this to succeed
Finally something big is coming after GOT
Bangladesh 🇧🇩 We want hindi dubbed 👑
I don't know why people in the comments section are obsessed with dragons and talking about dragons. GOT was never about the Dragons, it was the story the characters, the plot, the goals and ambitions of the people driving the plot. Season 8 had the most dragon screen time and it was the worst thing ever. Only time will tell if this is any good.
the cinematography is miles ahead of the original GoT, which is saying something considering the standard that show had when it first came out. I honestly think this will end up being the next step forward for streaming services, and will display just how far television shows can actually go to being cinema level.
this. and a movie should be made for aegon's conquest. so that we could see balerion the black dread.
"It's Not TV. It's HBO."
If a waiter or waitress is waring a Mask I make it a POINT NOT TO TIP them at the end of my meal. Sometimes I will not even pay for the meal and walk out disgusted 😒
At last wait comes to End 🔚 Love it ❤️
They could have released all the Snyder cuts and suicide squads, it still couldn't saved the butchered DCEU. It's time that HBO learnt the same. All this awesomeness for bran the broken to rule them all in the end ?? Some things are unforgivable. How they murdered the beloved GOT. Happy to see the efforts, but too little too late.
I don't know. no white walkers? Already feel bored 🤷
GOT was boring asf noty
Copy of game  of thrones 😂🤣😅😆😁😄
Please 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
"And all the dragons roared as one". Yeah because they were all dying off painfully.
2 minutes silence for those who are fan of game of thrones but don't know about House of the dragon
ok this puts some of my concerns to rest, really looking forward to this series now
Not sure I'm ready to Hate again.
halo show has better CG
I’m super excited for this ahhhh!!!
Dragon's cgi is not came close to got level 🤔
daenarys version 2
0:50 When HBO turns full Netflix...
Ironically Rhaenyra didn’t even kill Alicent when she took KL, but Alicent is telling Aegon here she’ll remove him because he’s a threat 🤦🏾‍♂️
Please provide it in hindi language
Whay so vsrato?
I was so disappointed at last season of GOT....but thankfully THE HOUSE OF TARGARYEN looks promising....so excited
I can not possibly imagine how this could give me the magical feeling the first seasons of Game of Thrones did before it collapsed, but i will gladly give this show a chance.
At the end of the series matt smith should get in a tardis and leave.
I liked the colours of unique colours of the dragons
I wanna download the Playlist now
black targaryan... Why include politics.... Ok include Asian targaryan, arab targaryan, mixed targaryan, hindou targaryan then ...
My TV's brightness will be at higher level in hope to see something in the dark
i reaaallly hope this show will be good, but i'm not overly optimistic.
Miss you Got 😭
Looks very good, the books are amazing and I hope this can be as good as the early seasons of GOT were!
The Background Score 👌👌👌👌
I just came my pants 🥴
Dude would make a good Gordon Ramsey if they made a movie about Gordon’s life including the bleeps. 😆
feminist propaganda  No thanks
About time! I've been looking for an excuse to give HBO my money!!
Can't wait see it
VENHA PARA MIM(  ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)☕
The Kashmir Files and Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2, Just Two Movies Succeed In 2022 From Bollywood...!!!!
2:30 What in god's name is that? It looks like it got cancer... What happened to the 3d artist?  I was so hyped about this show. You had to f**k up this one too... From the f***ing start this time
Makes me sad knowing what happens to the iron throne. 😑
Every nite since I started watching GOT five years ago,I still hum the Winds of Winter theme before showering.It never fails.
Якась хуїта, знову негри
Esto se va a descontrolaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar
Watchers : our reign is began
we want it in hindi dubbed 😔😔
I thought the valerians didnt have the sexism problem most medieval societies have because of magic and dragons
Wheres tryion
I really like how each dragon has its own look, they're not basically copied and pasted from one. They seem to all be different sizes and colours which makes this show seem more attention to detail agreed!
Release the Soundtrack. Love to hear it ❤️.
What is the timeline? How many years prior to GoT S1E1?
But no one can beat original "game of throne" Craziest thing was "the white Walkers"
incredible
House of the dragon, I though it was a documentary about Queen Elizabeth in Buckingham palace. Very misleading.
Need khalisi  back
Dracarys❤‍🔥
Why 33k dislike ???
Fantastic
i am getting the same vibe as the last season of GoT, sorry for the people who work so hard on this...but without a good plot it can't stand it.
I expect, this show might not have a disastrous ending like it was in GOT.
Isme white varker ja night king ka kush rol hai ja nahi  ?
So dark :/
❤️❤️❤️
Daemon Targaryen, that actor did a cringe dance in Morbius lol
Wait so the Duke of Edinburgh is actually a Targaryen? That explains everything in modern history!!!
I think that big foot was vhagar or maybe balerion but balerion is a black dragon
Will we see Balerion the Black Dread in this show?
I'm waiting for Hindi dubbed
Are there white-walkers? Not without them the series.
When will you launch in Korea?😫😤 As someone who already likes hbo series so much, this is the part that I am really curious about!! Plz 😫
😍😍😍😍😍
💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Where is Raeghar then Im so confused
I like this trailer better than LOTR one!
Where is duty, where is sacrifice reminds me of house stark ❣️
I loved when Rhae said When Iam queen I will create a new order🫖🔥🔥🔥I love how they represent women empowerment
I preferred the Ozzy Man Reviews version over this
Does feminism stick its eye out and risk to be poked out or is this all in fairness?
I can’t stand Matt Smith.
Wow 😮 i ami very excited to watch this web series goosebumps..     Definitely this series  created  history and break many records in whole world..  So congratulations advance HBO and House of dragon team....
I'm trying to picture the final battle at the God's Eye in this show and I'm just left confused. I initially thought that Matt Smith was playing the Older (two-eyed Uncle Prince) but from this trailer it seems like he's in opposition to those at Dragonstone. I'm so confused at this point. Maybe more so because I've seen the animated story of the Dance of Dragons and am looking for points in that story that have been translated over.
No matter how hard they try, they will never wash the stink that was left from the GoT last seasons.
Ready for the OG Dance with Dragons
Game of thrones dragon 🐉
Take a shot everytime you hear "iron throne"
Hello Dragons, I can tell your future because I've watched GOT
Yeah yeah venus in furs, I get it.
This puts Amazon’s Rings of Power to shame.
Is that balerion the black dread?
I’ll wait for what people have to say about the show before I even give it a chance. Not interested in investing emotions in this anymore
негр таргариен
WHY are they all so obsessed with inheriting the throne Isn't fun to just live and hang out with dragons  This is the heatwave brain speaking
I watched GOT for the dragons and imma watch this one for the dragons
Hopefully they learned their lesson from GoT’s ending and it actually has good writing. 🙏
Is this the Elden Ring DLC?
Me: this sounds a lot like...oh it actually is the song.
Am waiting for the unending suspense and thrill that follows.....what game of thrones couldn't give us, I think this show will....so excited
I can see myself watching this since I only watched got season 1 and 7 and 8 so I probably won’t know any of these people even though I know she does get the iron throne before she dies .i wish they ended season 8 off better
Please hbo make it watchable in India too🙏
Special Effects look great, but the lines and acting aren't too inspiring.
8.90M views come guys
Please make a sequel of GOT too ..... Please
I hope they show how female and male dragons make babies
Daenerys: I will break the wheel  Rhanyra: I will create a new order    Of course sweetheart...
looks great
I can't wait for it  Please don't ruine it like got
Is this song a cover of Velvet Underground's venus in furs or a rip off 🤔 😄
whiteface galore
FEELS LIKE ELDEN RING 💍 🥹❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
It looks great but not bigger than GoT
After the poor final series of GOT I just can’t be bothered to emotionally invest time and effort into this.
Ramin Djawadi ❤
why are there so many dislikes?
Just tell me that D&D are not in this project.
Please release in Hindi 🙏
Yay more whisper dialogue
So excited
This better not be bait and switch woke crap.
Looks a million times better than rings of power.
I love Matt Smith, but having watched Doctor Who I can’t unsee him as Eleven.
Blown away!
I'm I the only one who's disappointed  for the casting? This  prince Philip-guy from the serie Queen is awfull, also the others don't seem interesting when you compare to GoT. Unfortunately Dungeons and Dragons trailer showed more interesting casting.
Is it only me or does the subtle music at 0:12 sound a lot like Gaunter O'Dimm soundtrack from the witcher?
I’m seeing so many comments saying the writer has no experience, after GoT Season 8 it’ll be bad, George isn’t involved etc. So I’m genuinely concerned that people don’t realize this whole series was already written by GRRM in Fire and Blood. It’s not like Game of Thrones where they ran out of source material by Season 5. Theoretically they just have to adapt it to the screen like Peter Jackson did with LoTR and it should be great. I’m as salty as the next fan about Season 8, but you have got to do at least a smidgen of research before you make blanket statements like that. You’re allowed to be hopeful for this show I believe it will be really good. The story is fantastic and there’s room to fluff out plot points and characters while sticking to the plot. 👍🏼
I hope we get to see the Lannisters a lot too. I'd love to see them before they became the richest house. Plotting and planning but still loyal to the Targaryens out of convenience
Adipoli video, valare vilappetta information aanu share cheythathu... thank you so much👍👍👍❤❤❤
I sure hope there is a character like Tyrian in this to add a bit of comic relief in the early tense moment of the show and later on to grow.   Because this looks terribly redundant.. families fighting over the throne for seasons on end?   Without major side plots.
Can't wait for the dragons 🔥🔥🔥
EXCELLENT 💯 💯 💯 💯 💯
Too much woke nonsense. Honestly I'm disappointed in myself for expecting anything else.
The first ten episodes are written by GRRM. Sure I will watch those.
Good lord this better be as good as it looks
lI know the cinematography is great and all, but story looks lame, just some throne politics between a girl and another girl-looking man.. and probably others.. nothing mystical or whatsoever other than the dragons, which isn't too mystical at all, just big flying lizards.
This series will be a masterpiece like got   But plz dubbed this series in hindi
Por los dioses antiguos y los nuevos luce precioso.
Yung Dub D the rap sensation is here checking in
കട്ട  വെയ്റ്റിംഗ് 💥💥💥
Its time we make Black Panther 2 and make all the characters white for diversity
I want to see knight watcher and ghosts there too🙄🙄
We can all agree that this year was a rollercoaster of movies
Game of thrones is trash
No mention about the night king?
I swear I heard "iron throne" more times to remember than anything else on that trailer. I do wonder if this is about the Iron Throne
As much as season 8 of GoT was disappointing, and idk if this will be any better, I am still hyped to see so many dragons on screen :) definitely my favourite mythical creature. Wonder if we will get to see Balerion the black dread, although I’m not sure if it works chronologically. Does anyone know?
Anyone else get some goosebumps watching that?   Can't wait!
I remember seeing her on Bates Motel
Immediately I read the novella years ago, I wished for an adaptation. Basically a dream come true for me.
Drakaris! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
i get that they try to recreate that "winter is coming" catchphrase thing but "war is a foot" does not have quite the same ring to it
wow this doctor who episode is gonna be awesome
Why all the race swapping?
Wish I could say I was interested in this show . . . but I'm not.
White dreadlocked rasta targaryens
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat  😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
This show also needs a Targaryen woman who longs for power and to be a queen? Sorry but GoT already did that, so this’ll be just the same.
As long as Benioff and Weiss didn’t have anything to do with this show it’ll be fantastic.
I'm keeping my expectations low.
End of my August is all planned out! I can’t wait!
This series looks like it’ll be great for first 4 episodes. By the 5th episode it’ll lose some steam, at 6th episode we’ll start to see more hints of bad writing. 7th episode guessing for finale. By 8th episode, we will all wish we didn’t invest time to the series.
Cool - more feminism and black blonde people... Dislike and pass!
I can understand the need for more "diversity", but not as a Targaeryans. They are descibed as pale of skin. Once again a franchise that throws the lore out of the window for some extra woke points.
I gave it a look, but...no...the bad taste of GOT 8 is still too fresh to give this any views.
I wonder if someone will see into the future and mention Daenerys ❤❤🔥
Why is it, it's always the black man giving it to a white women in these Hollywood woke agenda pieces? Heaven forbid a black women finds a straight white male attractive.
Really liked the BGM in the trrailer. Hope to get some masterpiece musical scores like GOT.
So excited
I want to subscribe if arabic subtitles exist, can anyone confirm me that ?
I love see super powerful villains.. instead of human politics..
ধৈর্যের মাত্রা শূন্যে নেমে এসেছে।
Sun flare, and tons of light ._.  make up and hair looks lame aswell :(
black washing much ?
The BGM just increases everything else by tenfold.
Cant wait to see how iconic the opening theme song will be. Hopefully it will be as dope as the Game of Thrones one. . .
spoilers: White men bad, wahmen good. And alot of blackwashing.
veri nice movi
This doesnt even look that good maybe bad editing on trailer idk
Is this movie out does anyone know?
Spoiler Alert: This ending also sucks!
Masterclass !!
Can't wait <3
I would loved if this show came before GOT & now we are waiting for the rest with impatience .....
I loved GOT even with it's flaws and i'm sure i will love this series too but i'd like to see an anime series like the witcher did on netflix with that movie. In an anime you could do sooooo much more things, cooler fights and so on
this seems like GOT UPTRA PRO MAX
don't do that, don't give me hope .
RIP replay button!!! Amazing trailer!!! I can't wait for August 21st!!!
I'm gonna wait til the series ends and see if the reaction to the ending was as bad as the original series before ever watching this. Rather not waste my time and hate the ending again.

Pls make all seasons in hindi
Matt Smith is a big no for me, I can't see how he fits the roll too clean and posh
Wowo less goo incest wincest!!
A war is a foot!
Looks really good. . . but I'll hold my final judgment for any woke triggers.
Everyone looks pretty clean! In G.o.T their armor was dented -- at least a worn look, their tunics soiled or showing wear. Everything here looks straight out of wardrobe. the shields look like their paint is still drying. Dragons look like they spent more $ on them though.
This looks epic compared to LOTR series.
Looks good but I'm guessing it's not written by George RR Martin , mmmm not sure if it's going to be any good
This better make up for the ending of GOT
Massive 🔥
damn this show will burn hot
looks like the guy who forgot to adjust the gamma for streaming still works for HBO
The books were good but the race swapping in this is just stupid.
That looks so unbelievably bad lmao
only fan of game of throne sorry not intrested for house of dragon
I mean if youre making game of thrones spin off but the dragons look worse than they did in game of thrones the show automatically looks worse.
I never read a book but who is the protagonist? I hope Rhaenyra bcoz I am already hating Daemon's wife  Edit/Correction: Viserys's last wife
i'm very excited to see what the new intro (music) of the series looks like and whether it will come close to the intro from got.
I just cancelled hbo  not worth it
this is one of those times i wish there was a dislike buttons. overly emotional trash made for those born after the year 2000
Dear Netfix, I didn't want it to be this way, but you left us no choice, you will be missed but never forgotten.   HELLO HBO MAX!! wasssssup??!
😭😭😳😳
HYPE
Oooooh this is going to be good.
AMAZING
Ապուշություն 😅
It will be more feminist than the last 3 seasons of Game of Thrones
What if in the end credit scene Drogon takes Danny to the Red Priestess cult in Mereen to wake her up!! 😅
WHERE IS GANDALF

House of the Uterus - Obey All Wymyns The sad part is the premise of this is actually very, very good. You could have a lot of storytelling potential with it. The... comments from the lead people of the production, however, are all basically "the medieval period was really problematic" and one even tied in making a birthing subject into Roe v. Wade. I'm sorry, but no. If you're more interested in *_politics_* than *_telling a story_* I already know you have a dumpster fire on hand. And it's not like Game of Thrones doesn't have a bad track record, HBO.
Woops. Looks like my tampon fell out end got jammed between my estrogen and testosterone.
Will be such a truecopy of GOT. Recurring plots, characters and seasons. I onoy ask WHY?!
Hope it's not as woke as it seems from the trailer
Why do I feel this is going to be a flop show?!
Just make an action Online MMO where you can lose limbs and still survive and continue your adventure if you choose. Simple request you know LOL JK but that would be awesome! Just leave season 8 out of it...
is that a movie or series?
#HOTD
Looks better than LOTR crap.
Can’t wait for this
HARİKA BİR YAPIM...
It’s gonna be difficult getting use to some of these new faces.
Notice the contrast between dragons with reptilian 2:23 and avian traits 2:31.
I dont know Rick, would need some time to get used to the new characters, ease it in please.
This. Will be epic.🐉
А мені подобається ❤️
Негры азиаты и вся масонская лабудень ничего нового
💚😍😍😍😍
i cant wait
wow
It looks better than ring of power thats for sure. Is this before or after Dance of Dragons?
you are the best💚💚💚💚💚💚💚
THIS HAVE POTENTIAL!
Such a wasted opportunity.
Okay so this is what I'm going off rn.  King Viserys got a brother, Daemon (matt smith) and a daughter Rhaenyra. He got no son so names his daughter. Brother doesn't like it. This splits the council. Otto hightower is Hand, he got a daughter Alicent. Alicent and Rhaenyra are friends until they aren't. Corlys Valaryon, the African gentleman (sorry its the only way I can describe him easily) goes with Daemon? Uhh, big war, dragons die, Daemon gets throne?
dubbed in Hindi please
dub in Hindi
Why black Targarians not albinos?
It looks aesthetically pleasing but I am not feeling it yet, I'll trust and just watch I hope I'll get attached to characters just like Game of Thrones
Looks better than rings of power at least
WOKE
Bland characters. One liners. Dhun dhun.
There are no black valyrians

We know a black targaryen was forced in this show so that to please the woke liberal crowd😂😂😂😂
Why it feels like some comments have been bought....
Looks bad
I'm aprehensive to invest in this show due to the way G.O.T ended ... I know it's not just me 😔
Probs will be good but this trailer is poor
Kinda looks like garbage
@HBO MAX Please dubbed it in Hindi plz......... ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🇮🇳
OMG, ich freue mich so!
dont do taht u r destroying got ...no more season
Please release it in also hindi
Its good, but when will GOT season 2 come, I am praying for Bran 🙏🏻
Love the music.
Please make good use of all the dragons from Elden Ring.
New movie release me up fast
The plot looks really boring so far. Lets hope the more interesting elements simply didn't fit in a trailer properly.
I can’t with this little snippet of aemond claiming vhagar i‘m so excited !!!!!
GIVE ME IT!!! Missed GoT. Great to have it back
2 questions:  How many years before GOT it is?  Why is there even a drama with succession if the dude is way older than the girl?
GoT wasted my time.
without offense black character with white hair looks bad! I’m afraid only the Targaryan house will be not as interesting as the whole Westeros world.
looking forward to this
Right, looks nice. But what's the point of watching this? You made GOT's ending so spectacularly incompetent that it sours everything both retroactively in its universe as well as anything that may still follow.
GOT: Chaos is a ladder.  HOTD: War is a foot.
Loved the trailer but was hoping from the beginning to get a glimpse of Cregan Stark. Though I understand as he comes to play later on in the story.
02:19 - the absolutely hands down PRETTIEST woman in this entire series, and we only get a glimpse for her for like 3 seconds... Seriously, HBO? -_-
Waiting for this masterpiece 👏
Hmmmm, guess we'll see
Who else saw the orange cat first in the thumbnail then realised it was the dragon's nose ? #Onceseen
is that balarion the black dread at 1:48
?????? Why do black people appear in Western fantasy?
Wow 👌👌👌👌👌🤟🤟
Is this just one season?
Skeptical but hopeful. GoT was good (during its first four seasons) because of well-acted scenes and great dialogue, not big battles and cgi dragons.  Currently, HBO has Succession to fill that space, so let’s see if this can bring anything close to that level…or if it’ll just be cgi dragons and “surprising” character deaths.
Atlast any show can equally hypnotized the audience same as the GOT did in past.
Belorian the black dread
So diverse, look, stronk WAHMEN.........so boring
We want this series in hindi dubbed 😎 We want all seasons of Game Of Thrones in hindi dubbed 😎
This looks extremely boring
Those who thought hotd is going to be bad, wait till you watch. Was good to see Daemon & Caraxes in the trailer.
what a load of crap.
THIS IS AN ACUTAL FIRE WITH REAL FIREEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!
🔥 I AM YOUTUBE 🔥🔥           🔥 MERA TAG CHANNEL HAI🔥🔥 🥰 MERE CHANNEL SE AAPKI HELP HO SAKTI HAI🔥🔥 🔥🥰 NICE VIDEO 🔥 Jo bhi mera comment pad rha hai Bhagwan useke meta pita ko khus rakhe
I hope they don’t make out the Deamons the good guy and rheanyra the deranged man woman like in game of thrones
time to cansel netflix and enter the HBO .they been killing it lately
Can't wait to be disappointed all over again
Plz hindi dub krna 🙏
I would do that blonde
Women King
I don't know.......... looks pretty boring if you ask me.
I guess everyone is going to get HBO again.😆😅🤣

One decent trailer doesn't wash away the memory of seasons 7 and 8. I'm keeping my expectations very low for this show, in hopes that it will be great.
Waiting ❤️🔥
Imagine HBO making series on Mahabharat
HBO comes india
HBO make series on Mahabharat
This gave me goosebumps... Looking forward to August 21st.
please release in hindi all seasons
8 million views in one day, not bad, and some people say they don't care about gane of thrones anymore...
Not much interesting..it s too late..we waited and forgot GOT Because you HBO forgot us GOT fans and made waiting for too long time and created worst final season and forgot there without going forward..
ക്ലാസ്സ്‌ ആയിരിക്കും എന്ന കാര്യത്തിൽ യാതൊരു സംശയവും ഇല്ലാ.   RR Martin!
A BLACK targaryen?
Oohhh....I can see Mutation in dragons
EDIT: the woman dying in a gruesome way does not matter, it's not about women or men getting killed wtf is wrong with you chat..  sigh.. another "women can be kings" narrative? zzzzzzzzzz  Also give that man some eyebrows.
Over the centuries, House Targaryen has produced both great men and monsters. Prince Daemon was both. In his day there was not a man so admired, so beloved, and so reviled in all Westeros. He was made of light and darkness in equal parts. To some he was a hero, to others the blackest of villains.   edit: This quote is from Fire and Blood of Archmaester Gyldayn, thank Kady Fillinger for reminding me
I cannot wait to see this!!!
I like so many others are damaged from the wounds of season 8, im hoping this will be different, but im not holding my breath.
Looks solid. Doesn't seem to have the magic of the earlier Game of Thrones seasons, but still looks good.
Hmmm… pass.
The Blood wyrm looking properly menacing and I have a feeling the big claw was Vhagar
boring.
Hindi dubbing pls
i got a whole minute and a half in thinking this was the dungeons and dragons movie
I'm sure they wont wait to depict females running everything. The Nights king mom, or Daenerys Targaryen twin grandmother...lol.. No thanks, I'll past...
Im very very exited for this
These dragons, especially Caraxes did not have the same budget as the original show…. They just look off
According to the books Valyrians have "very pale skin". If they have to force diversity down our throats anyway, why not include East Asian and middle eastern Valyrians as well?
What's going on with the valeryons though, most people aren't going to know nore care but I just want to know why
It’s not going to be good.
I fear for the calendar, its days are numbered.
To me its look like a parody to orginal GOT
What's up with the black Targaryen?
For the people who have read the books…. How accurate is this trailer/show? I just want the original content. I don’t want “wokeism” to damage this series that has potential.
Matt Smith is a good actor but his face doesnt match period pieces at all he too idk modern
ngl, I think lips on dragons is silly. They should either be like alligators or beaks.
House of the Garbage
I cannot wait! Epic trailer.
Please HBO MAX launch in India🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳 🙏
Is this gonna have the same level of violence and war like GOT though
can’t wait for the show but can’t wait for the score even more 😂
They made a mistake by casting all UK actors once again.  The talent pool dwindles quickly.
Prince philip has dragon now..
that was an exciting trailer....it remainded me of GOT season 1 level enthusiasm
If Ser Duncan the Tall is not in this show I swear to god…
Gotta Love House of the Dragon! 🐉 🐲  Liked 👍. Shared on MeWe 👍.  Shared on Facebook 👍.  Saved on YouTube 👍.
HOUSE OF DA WAGON.
Cannot wait to see Rhaenyra eaten by the dragons
Can't wait 🥰
I'm having doubts with the cast Mostly Emma darchy as princess Rhaenyra
Keen!!
Get ready to see lots of incest lol😂
All roads leads to season 8
In this house of the dragon white Walker is there
Marvel Studios needs to tap into HBO’s GGI avenues lol.
Let's go
The best the best the best the best
1:32 omfg she sounds like Daenerys 😍😍😍😍
Hard for me to get excited about a prequel when I know how the story ends : /
She's my queen
Sounds like game of thrones
Game of thrones' future
Meh.
i am the only who hate this soundtrack? looks like a medieval netflix low budget movie, i really miss ramin djawadi 😫
It's trending #11 in India...
I just don’t see the point
..💗
It gives me feelings of GOT ... House of Dragons ...🔥🔥
What about Indian fans why u doesn’t launch HBO max in india 😞😞
Looks good .hope finale sticks the landing
❤️❤️❤️♥️♥️♥️👌👌👌🙏🙏🙏🔥🔥🔥
Always a dice roll with child actors I hope they pull it off!
Wow, lmao, this looks IMPRESSIVELY bad 😂😂.  Let's see here.....shameless key-jangling nostlagia for the retards, showing sweeping cityscapes of areas we loved when GoT was actually good? CHECK. Adding insult to injury, not only spitting in the face of longtime fans by absolutely ruining GoT and then ignoring all complaints and moving on to the next project....but further yet making it a bad WOKE copy of GoT?  CHECK.  Cast numerous actors and actresses that apparently can't act at all and come across as teenagers trying out acting for the first time ever?  CHECK.  A script, dialogue, and character arcs that will almost certainly be poorly and lazily written by untalented screenwriters?  ALMOST A CERTAINTY, just look at any other big budget media projects these days.  This trailer made me cringe so many times.  Such an OBVIOUS miss, and a slap in the face to their fans, the one's paying their salaries that invested in their product (GoT) in the past.    Ya know.....the worst part isn't that Hollywood is now just blatantly trying to rip off their audiences without even any guise about the matter.....the worst part is just how blindingly incompetent they are.  I could abide the attempt at abusing me and others, at least far moreso, if at least came from a non-smooth-brain place, if it was at least competently orchestrated.  House of the Dragon: "Come watch us take our most loyal and unintelligent fans and drag them through the mud." lmfao.  The Mountain (post-trial-by-combat) comes to mind when thinking about this show: a gigantic mountainous reanimated abomination of the corpse of a formerly potent show.
Why are targaryens black
As long as it’s better than season eight I’m happy

It looks epic...I have faith that the plot and script will be on the same level. I am really excited for the show.
Everyone we saw in the trailer dies at the end of season 1
Success full
Ah yes, the woman who wants the throne but can't because she needs to learn her place, but won't. Gotta smash that patriarchy!
Reptilian’s rule our world people ! Wake up
The dragon symbol at the end gave me Mortal Kombat vibes
This is just a question but how is there a black Targaryen? I thought they were a race of incestuous pale/blonde white folks?
❤️❤️❤️
This is going to be everything rings of power will never be.

1k Subscribeer challenge 😱😱   I respect 😍😍everyone who  were involve in this seriously the best piece that's I will ever seen on YouTube we love💖💖 you all videos
You going to ruin this too?   I just don't want to waste my time again.
My only nit picks would be armour not having faceplates, daemon's actor not being intimidating enough and looking kinda weird with the wig.
უმაგადესია 👍
Sounds all types of delightful, I cannot wait until the soundtrack is released so I can choreograph to it. 👣🎶  Thank you all so much for releasing this new sequel! My ancient Celtic 🕈/Viking (Scandinavian)⚔ancestors would be proud 😊!  #moderndance #moderndancechoreographer  #Vikings
I just hope it's woke and diverse.
Hope it has a lot of characters
Woke cancer ruining everything.
Looks complete trash.  The story that no one asked for. Modern leftard politics foisted on audience. I'm out.
This is going to be the best show in tv history
Looks way better than the new LOTR series
Não tô botando muito fé que vá ser bom.
Cant wait
Oh yes!!!!
why don't you release it in hindi
Oddly inert...
i cant wait any longer!,!!,!,!,
No Emilia🥲🥲🥲🥲
Where's tyrion
I thought Katheryn Winnick would be here. 😥😥
I came here for the dragons then the story. Shoutout to the special effects team or whoever is responsible for the dragons. They did such an amazing job.
Can't wait to be disappointed by the last episode
The actress for younger rhaenyra is soooo 🥵😩😩
I already planned on skipping this after the final season. But after watching this preview, I'm certain. I'll be skipping this.   I assume Hollywood will figure out what we want eventually. This ain't it.
Hopefully this isnt woke
please be good 🙏

I wont be fooled again by the show that makes terrible endings... Extraordinary woo young woo is 100x better than this show will ever be...
Looks too similar to GoT .. idk bros idk
It looks so good
Please be good please be good
Which is worse? A prequel to a series with a horrendous finale or an unnecessary prequel show for an already epic conclusive Trilogy?
Yeahhhhh
The trailer is very good in terms of how it has been put together , kudos to the team at HBO and looking forward to a great TV series.
Wow!!!
Niggaryen
The hobbit 4 is looking good
Bahahahaha fake Game of Thrones
THE SONG IS PURE GOLD!!!
Bro look this looks so much better than the Lord of the rings on Amazon
Anyone here not a bot?
#NickiMinaj is the Queen of Rap
Last time I paid for the streaming service just to watch GOT, this does not even make me want to spend a dollar. I'll just wait till I can watch it for free because it looks like a GOT 2.0 and we all know how terrible the last few seasons of GOT was.
Blood and Cheese. If you know you know
Oh how I've missed you 😍
Vhagar is so big
Ned is coming back boys!
Well I'm in Full Fan / Geek Mode = Excited as ever to watch.
This show has a chance to be the best of the Year i can't wait
To the old dragons of Valyria, DRACARYS. ❤
Finally! Let's go!!!!
House of the Woke Garbage
Is this a sequel or prequel
you want to disappoint me again? accepted.
I'm getting a woody?😅
Looks like it's filmed mostly in the castle and that's not what I was hoping for bit boring, hopefully I'm wrong and we get to see more of the world.
I currently have 5 dragons and I took two of them out flying a couple of days ago and when we did a low fly over the WalMart parking lot everyone was running like it was some kind of big deal ...
Compare this to Rings of Power.  Rings of power =  Uninhabited world (too clean) CGI that looks like CGI Illogical armor Generic trailer (they're afraid they don't have any story to offer)
Not Dragons
No thanks. I can't do Fear the Game of Thrones.
What is the name of the soundtrack used in this?
Do people not understand that editing the worlds lore to accommodate modern progressivism and "diversity" is a dangerous precedent for the shows plotline? Did people not already witness what happens when a show diverts from the work of GRRM?
Team Targaryen Forever 🐉🖤❤️
Keep it…
Finish the books.  I have been waiting to long! Jon is still dead.
Ha ha ha, those blacks with blonde hair (they had to braid them so it doesn't look even more stupid), in their european medieval armour.. Ha ha. Just another far left, w0ke drivel.
This looks awful. House of the Woke.
Game of Thrones: I'm not going to change the wheel, I'm going to break it. House of the Dragon: When I'm queen I'll create a new order. Hundreds of millions of dollars to fail to tell the story that they already failed to tell.
This looks low-budget and terrible.
Valar morghulish
I respect every one who were involved in this seriously the best piece of even seen on YouTube hat off to well all
When you support someone from start and than u See him on this stage. Really feeling proud of you  Guys need all of your support
.
This looks dumb af
ياريت تدعموني 👋❤️
looks like a banger.  Good part is the showrunners have this story already mapped out for them.
I'm not feeling it just yet.  Hopefully they'll make us truly feel for the characters (love or hate) like we did with GoT.  We'll see.
Sir my humble request to you is that Plzz dubbed this series in Hindi language
I'll never forget how badly they botched Game of Thrones ending. I hope this trash flops.
So it seems like they have different types of dragons in this show. Some look like dany’s and some a bit different. I hope Meleys look like the GOT dragons
Lol the blonde dreadlocks
Valhar morghulis
Will this show fix the awful ending to Game of thrones?
They Are Coming To Hunt and Nobody can stop them 🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉 Even HBO Max Can't 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 #indiaisonfireagain
milk that cow
this is so bad
If some of the stories they read to you in the GoT story videos on YouTube about these guys actually happens… This is gonna be wild!!!
Stop culture appropriating off of  white people. Create your own epics. Get off our backs.
Am I buggin or did y’all see Daenerys too
As if a black man has long straight white hair and is related to them, one of them.  Ugh. Go Woke Go Broke.
No one cares. GOT was ruined.
Did they seriously use Velvet Underground for the trailer music. That's awesome.
i almost morb
I hope this show is more like seasons 1-4 of GoT. Still, I think it will be a huge success
My only question is, did they change Aegon II role?
It all seems kind of pointless because we know how it ends for them. We know none of those girls are going to get the iron throne, we know eventually their House is ruined. And dang did they pick an ugly cast!
VHAGAR AND CARAXES LOOK SO GOOD
Should have just married your brother and your daughter. Bam! Solution.
Please make The Long Night after HOTD
I wonder how much season 1 is going to cover. I can't imagine they stretch out the DotD beyond two seasons.
Never seen GOT. Do I have to watch to understand this?
well we all know how that big dragon ends up...rip
This is not going to be good without D&D writing it.
Please be good
Looks like Amazon Cheddar of the Rings crap.
Imagine what they could have done if it began with the conquest? I will never understand why staring in the middle of the book.
I hope the magic can be reignited again after is was put out and buried by the horrible last season of game of thrones, my expectations are low but I’m still giving this a chance
Lovely but I am going to read the book first
Words cannot express my excitement for this
It looks good but when i think about how it ends. My expectation and urge to watch just fade away.
just one black actor? lol
Which books is this series based on and did George RR  complete them?
Dragons finally
Ill take a miss. The way they ruined GOT for me in the last 2 series will never be forgotten.
I don't want a prequel... What of Jon Snoe'?
Is this based on the books? If so I’ll watch. If the same writers are winging it like final two seasons of got…then i guess I’ll wait for my daughter to watch. Just wondering. God bless and please no mean comments. ❤️
Creepy how there are no negative comments in here... Can comments be hidden??
Anyone got the song title playing though?
WTF all I can say is 😳 I can't wait!!!!!
cast is not good
this and honor among thieves look damn good
Hold on let me pick my jaw up
Idk how I feel about the dragons just yet. They seem really smooth and polished. The dragons in GOT looked so life-like with the scales, the texture and grittiness. Unpopular opinion but I liked the dragon design that Danys dragons had
Shame about the wokeness... A dark skinned blonde haired Corlys Velaryon
Aight I'm all about inclusion but homeboy with the blonde dreads has got to go.
I like how they made Caraxes actually look violent and bloodthirsty. It does seem like they are going to give the dragons different personalities too!
Everyone forgets the last season....always be careful with shows now ;)
GOOSEBUMPS
Since when are House Velaryon from the Summer Isles?
Not going to lie: after being sorely disappointed with Game of Thrones S8, I find this trailer VERY refreshing!
I see a whole lot of Feminism in this one.

Still doing that "trailer before the trailer" thing, huh? Why?
" when something is good,.. Dont change it", but change is also good but do not do it for self gain and greed ,cause it will not matter.. In the eye's of other's."- by me... Yes I am drunk.
The soundtrack 🖤
30k dislikes not bad not bad keep going
Can't wait
looks great! can't wait for the disappointing ending.
Sorry, no. Finish the book, Winds of Winter and then I'll finish the story, but even then I'll never forgive and never start consuming another new Martin product.
Aemond One-Eye!!! Fearless.
When all the dragons roars at once” the line give chills imagine the sound 🙆🏻‍♂️🙆🏻‍♂️
Look's like it's going to be nothing like the book. Extremely disappointing.
The disappointed fans remembers, the last season let down is coming
Doctor?
I'm so excited
We want in Hindi also
I’m a 89 year old grandpa using my grandsons account, and I cannot tell you how excited I am for this movie 😃
Damn that throne reminds me of the art from Secrets of the Citadel
C’mon HBO, you were always good at not doing the “trailer before the trailer” crap. Don’t start now!
One thing for sure the best hair goes to Daenerys
Hey I didn't know that the Targaryens put "hairs" on the Iron Throne. Did anyone know about the "hairs" that ruled during the Targaryen dynasty? I've read all the books, and seen the show several times each, but never knew about the "hairs" that sat the Iron Throne. Crazy that the masters skimmed over that in the histories of Westeros!
The most important thing when it comes to watching HOTD “If you think this has a happy ending, you haven’t been paying attention”
ok so uhhhhhhhhh... when do you guys think new rick and morty comes out
Can't Wait...🎬📺📽🎞📺🎥 Let's Go.
I can't wait  To be disappointed
NGL looks lame
Yes more,
I'm not sure about having different actresses for young and old version of the character. Emily Carey is 19 and Olivia Cooke is 28 but she could easily look a lot younger. I feel like the age gap isn't big enough to have 2 different actresses. Let's hope it does well on screen.
Curious to know if I should read the book first before beginning the series or after the series is over read it someone help 🙏?
Unfortunately I have read the history of the Targaryens and already know the outcome. There are no Barathyens in the main cast, hmm. I believe this is because they are spot lighting the Valaryens due to making them black, which is fine but, they are not from the summer lands which is false. I guess affirmative action is alive and well. Just finish the damn books already George ffs...
I would like the whole storyline of the current game of thrones to be rewritten if this series is successful
Oh boy, here we go again
Smells like woke in here aka a flop
Morbius bad man vampire
GoT disappointment round 2
Dragon had armor on thats dope
Nice
I hope this is good cuz i’m looking to get my fantasy fix from some where wheel of time and Lotr rings of power were garbage!
We all know how this ends.. all the targs are dead, all but one dragon is dead... and a mass genocide happens. If they wanted us to be invested in this show they should have prevented the Annihilation of the world and universe that this show is going to take place in
It ends with none of the targaryens and none of the dragons existing... so who cares... if they wanted this to work they should have fired Dan and Dave when they turned in the script for season 8...
Where is the epic music that we know from Jawadi?
Where’s jon snow
HBO should associate with George RR Martin and Hidetaka Miyazaki/From Software and make the Elden Ring show.
I have never been more resdy for a premiere
I don’t care. That’s the tragedy of Season 8. I don’t care about this franchise no more.
I wonder who will be there main enemy here? Is the  night king exist at this moment, i have no idea😂😂😂 i mean, epic burning and waiting for the best intense war or scene are worth to wait😂😂
WE WUZ TARGAREYANZ N SHIET
The most powerful dragon is the one with the best story.     Also, not the best wig-work.
Better than the rings of power trailer but this i going to disappoint people expecting Game of Thrones
looks weird
White dreads look horrible
I am really going to miss the actors of GOT. I hope this series is written according to the bokes. If Emilia Clarke shows up, it will just enlighten the series (but it can happen only towards the end). MISS GOT SO MUCH
Who was the Night King, what did the night king want? He was able to disobey the children of the forest, proving he has free will so what did he want? What about that ice alter that he took Crastas sons to? What did he do with them? What did the symbols mean? Who or what was the many faced god? Who were the faceless men and who was Jaqen H'ghar? what happened to them? What happened to Dario Narhis?                         What did the voice say to Verys when he was cut? What happened to the other red priests/priestesses? What was the lord of light?  What was the point of Brans character? Why did the Night King want to kill him? Bran did nothing to the story apart from telling Jon about his parentage and Sam already learned about it and would have told him anyways. Why did winter just stop with the Night Kings death?? He brought storms and made it colder but winter still happened regardless of his presence... Winter happened for a 1000 years while he and the whites were in hibernation so why on earth would it stop with his death? This story is called a song of ice and fire, it was always about life coming together to overcome death, it was never about the throne... None of the series biggest questions were answered or even addressed... I've never been so let down by a show/movie... And I've seen the new star wars series. Since the original was a pointless waste of time and a terrible show in the end... who cares about this money grabbing spin off that leads to this nonsense
og series for og people
is this become "the game of woke"?
I've got a feeling this is going to be some woke women empowerment thing.  Let's hope the story is actually good this time.
Damn I'm excited for this!
gosto dessa atriz de bates motel mt boa

algum brasileiro?
They really saved some money with the cast, I would have expected at least 2-3 stars
I can't take Matt Smith seriously since Morbius
None of the actors come across as particularly engaging at first glance.
It's a bit hard for me to think these dragons are realistic especially when compared to danys dragons. Tbh they look soft and made with cheap computers
🔥🔥🔥
Lot of Dragons! Exactly what I am looking for
After how dirty they did us at the end of GoT I ain't watching this. If they can do the series without being idiots and selling out at the end again then after the series is over maybe I will give it a watch.
Take away the dragons, I don't think anyone would watch this thing lol
Alicent Hightower reminds me of Margaery Tyrell
Game of Thrones did well because of the story but also the mystery of the White Walkers.  I hope this series also includes some mysteries in this world we get to learn about.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This looks pretty good honestly
If they had finished Game of Thrones properly there'd be a lot more hype for this. When you've got a good thing, don't cut corners!
Honestly does not look bad, this was a great first impression
Balerion will appear?
Had to make Targaryen’s black…..really 🤦🏼‍♂️.
Dragons CGI was next level....🐉🔥⚔
🐉🐉🐉
OOOOOOOOOOOH GOOOOOOOD GIVENCHY
How to double the number of HBO customers in 3 minutes lol
LOL
lol, can someone just dub the "How to train your dragon" trailer over this?
I hope they introduce drugs on this series and there’s lots of wild, creative  fckng
I will be seated
OMG i am so excited for this nice show
I'm a huge ASOIAF fan, but I'll be honest, I'm really struggling to summon up any enthusiasm for this show at all.  I'll give episode 1 a try, but I'm not holding out a lot of hope.
A dwarf would be amazing to add
Spoiler alert she doesn’t become queen she dies
i wonder if they call pull of an epic, classic, and memorable opening credits sequence like the original GOT. i really hope they do. nothing even comes close to this day.
The Dragon’s look beautiful.
🙏 #thesh18story
Looks better then the rings of power! Promising af
I thought this was from the Hobbit
Meh
Looking dope!! Not so disappointing as lord of the rings!
Hindi ???
Nah.
Well this looks promising 🔥🔥
Absolutely phenomenal work. Ramin’s scores are slapping as always. The attention to detail is impeccable. And I’m so excited to see Ryan bring his nerd dream to life. Let’s go!  #HOTD
The story is 600 years before the Game of Thrones. but it has the same weapon technology.
When tf are studios ever going to hire decent composers again.
I want  The North King " Jon Snow ". ❤️
If they try and make this show woke.. I hope they go broke!
the doctor's tardis is looking a bit scaly
I don’t think they mentioned the open throne enough in this trailer.
I am already thinking abt how the end will be disappointing
Muy buena peli
“His armor fused to his skin” that was a SPLIT second shot but I’m willing to bet …
thepiratebay+
Well... What is dead may never die
This looks like it will be awesome especially the dragons!  Because I’m in it for the dragons so I’ll be waiting on YouTube to see the dragons lol 😂 considering the GOT was a fetish like anything else with boring stuff like talking🙄 but love the idea with the first born female having to show she deserves the throne❤️‍🔥! Hopefully there’s more dragons tamed and untamed of all shapes, sizes, and colors too 😍! I can just see the show I’m making in my mind right now🤩
The creators hate White people
As long as D'ipshit & D'ipshit aren't the writers, I'm willing to give this franchise another chance.
We waz Velaryons n shieeeettttt
Of all people I did not expect Matt Smith to play in this series. I'm intrigued.
💯💯💯💯💯
Thank God we have full fledged story scribes in Book else they would destroy it like GOT
Is this dance of dragons?
No
Oh look. Another show with rightful Targaryen queen having what is rughtfully hers being taken away. So far Im only excited for dragons and Rhaenyra
All I know is the many faced God and the lord of light better make appearances.
Can't wait for a lot of great story arcs building up and then just vanishing or getting utterly destroyed by an abrupt final season!
Game of Thrones is just Lord of the Rings for atheists and redditors
This looks so sick!
this looks great but i still cant forgive them for how they ended the series. i wont watch this until the series comes to an end. fool me once...
At least they got their token character in.
I already know im gone love it
why are there blacks
I've heard that they plan for the story to last 3-4 seasons, so we need to make sure it is successful enough to last that long
So many views within hours of release ? Damn records will be broken here. Can't wait to see what the show will bring and numbers.
FIRE...
Had my doubts about this but the trailer got me intrigued ngl
look up ppl greatness waiting for us
❤️❤️❤️🥰
Será que vai ter o Rayquaza?
Looks much better than Game of Thrones first season
The rings of power serie and house of the dragons i'm happy
What's wrong with all of their mouths?
Really looking forward to this series. I loved the dragons in Game of Thrones and I like the visuals of this trailer. Mostly looking forward to the dragons haha. But overall very much looking forward to this!
Oh gross. Anyway HBO could CGI over all those white people? Hard to be excited for a show that seems to validate whiteness.
Love it. Please don't disappoint as before. Also bring Raised by wolves. Please.
Give us Jon Snow and Dany 10 years after the ending of GoT. Drogon flew Dany to Volantis where she was resurrected and Jon has been ranging and leading the free folk North of The Wall.  Do this, and you will secure a financial home run like you've never known before..
This will be much much better than rings of power
Soundtrack?
Chills…
I can't wait
Looks amazing
I'm too heartbroken to get too hyped
How many times word 'Iron Throne'  through out the trailer , I forgot.
Very cool except half of us already know how this ends maybe even more than that. I mean the show is literally gonna show us the dance of the dragons. And believe it or not I'm not even hyped abt the dragons as I'm hyped about the winter wolves and rodrik dustin
Iron Throne? Again?
Is this accurate to the books or a completely original story?
We know how its ends so….
"Hey niece, let's just get married so we'll both be King and Queen, this is GoT after all" - Daemon Targaryen
Little did they know all this effort and their descendant will ruin it all
मैं दोबारा मेरे शहर के आप आप से हो सकता है
Don't know why but was expecting Arya stark in the trailer
HBO winning the stream wars with this one.
I hope this competes, I truly do
Looks average
This series looks great, can't wait to see all the dragons!
It’s gonna be sad watching this knowing everyone died, just like watching Dany dying all over again.
I never finished game of thrones. I dropped off at about season 6, but Matt Smith looks like he's finally being given good material, and I will watch whatever he's in.
very nice
Who has a better story than Season 8 of Game of Thrones? Nobody.
There should be a series for House of Lions
finallyyy
I want this trailer and hole season in Telugu language pls release it.because so many people's are interested these season .they had been much fan bass these game of thrones season in telugu people's in India
And khalesi kinda forgot about them... The disappointment tho!
Another  woke fail
meh.
Looks promising 🤗 can't wait
I don’t feel it.
GoT ending was one of the worst experiences I had with something I adored before. I don't wanna be brokenhearted again. Should I give this a chance hmm..?
I always loved how the Targaryen songs from GoT were made in terms of majesty in comparison to the others. But this masterpiece here... this is a whole new thing. Ramin is still HBO's greatest treasure for the world of Ice and Fire.
alibaba game of throne
Is it just my brain playing tricks on me or have they made copies of The OG characters in this series?  It looks cool but somehow its like i am seeing familiar faces in the characters shown in this trailer
Looks like more woke garbage from the generation who has access to all the knowledge that has ever existed and still chooses to make up ridiculous garbage so the pathetic can whine it is all somebody else's fault. No reward for dedication, hard work and winning just participation ribbons all around. Take this crap and shove it along with its D-list casting. I want to see Ray Ramone playing Barack Obama, and Caitlyn Jenner as his first lady, then I will believe color blind casting is not a total crock of sh1p.
Hot trailer... 🔥🔥🔥 sorry for the pun... 😜   Targaryens fan here. Really excited and have high expectations for this show but perhaps I'll wait for the blu-ray/dvd release.  My support will always be for the beautiful Rhaenyra. Wonderfully portraited by both actresses I must say. 😍❤️
when the movie gets on cinmana?
So basically, if the brother would inherit the throne, there would be no war and everyone would be happy?
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
I'm surprised at how good this looks. I'll be watching it because of Matt Smith, I'm not going to lie.
Gosh it looks so much better without Mr. Dumb and Dumber writing the show . I just wish these crap writers didnt write the main show , it would have been much better.
He should have zigzagged.
I don’t like the modern remix they tried making the trailer sound like. It’s like they’re trying too hard to replicate GOT lmao. I’m here for the dragons and hopefully it’s more epic than this
So boring
the coolest thing in this trailer for me is the kingsguard they have always been the coolest thing in the song of ice and fire universe for me

Can't wait to not watch this.
For casual fans they'll watch, for real fans this is a mess, can't change the authors source material to fit your modern world narratives it's appalling.
damm cant ait

Take a drink every time someone says “Iron Throne”

hope they dont fk it up like GoT s08

Looks way better than Ring of Power on PRIME

Is this spin-off of GOT or story after GOT 🙁🙁🙁
People before watching this trailer: "Meh! They lost me with Game of Thrones, season 8!" People after watching this trailer: *"OMG! This looks so good! I'm so hyped!!"*
meh
Snore! George RR Martin, if you’re reading this: You hurt me. You never finished writing the book series. Shame on you.
It's unfortunate how bad D&D ruined this universe. I'm not too excited about this trailer because it can just be some cheap action-y show in GoT world.  What I'll be waiting for is how well the 1st season does in pulling me in and making me start caring about the characters in show. That's what did it for me in GoT.  The North Remembers!
DIdn't think I could give anything GoT related another chance after how they effed up season 8 but I think I'll actually give this one a shot.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wouldn't it be EPIC if these fantasy shows and movies mixed from time to time like WTF MUST WATCH!! It's unlikely but once they get established and get a little dull just some extra entertainment from the Witcher, LOTR, etc..
I really miss jon
Is it me or is the music a version of Venus in Furs by the Velvet Underground?
We wuz targaryans and shieeeeet.
Piece of crap :(
My confidence level for this series is very low, but it's still significantly higher than for the Rings of Power...
I have a feeling, the message might be heavily featured in this series - I am ready for my expectation to be masterfully subverted tho
Who is scoring this show?
this is how sequels (= or prequals) should look like and not like this new LOTR crap.
It's another woke feminist garbage tv show  and why waste your time watching it if you already know the ending
The dialogue sounds like shite, but the show seems like it will rock. Though am pretty sure Rharnyra will be shown to as a hero unlike the main series where heroes are grey
Caraxes and Syrax look exactly how I pictured them in Fire & Blood. Can't wait to see what Vhagar looks like.
We all know where this is going, but we don't know how. It's probably worth the wait
my pain from season 8 still makes me kinda numb to this
OMG... my husband has been watching this clip 1000000000000000000 times.................
Thats a lot of witchers
Live action version of ‘How to train your Dragon’ looks very violent!
As long as DB Weiss and David Benioff have nothing to do with this, I'm all in. I still have PTSD from those two ruining the end of GoT.
gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage
oh gad!
This is some Anglophile trash. I'd rather watch We Own This City or even Tales From the Crypt than this.
Ramin Djawadi is going to absolutely kill it again If the trailer is anything to go by.
Is it just me or does Viserys Targaryen look like Stannis Baratheon in the 0:54 shoot? Could just be the angle right there tho.
Let's hope this won't have a lackluster blunt ending like the GOT!
Does anyone actually care anymore?
This looks horrible.
The music 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Nah, already sense the woke trash and poor story telling that we've come to expect from Hollywood. Hard pass.
I’m a little nervous it looks more happier than game of thrones and that’s disappointing.
CGI looks super fake even on my pc monitor.
Please don’t be like Vikings new series
Is this based on any source material? They should make a series based on the Hedge Knight trilogy.
This looks amazingly stunning. The fact that each dragon is unique and different, shows the  dedication they put into this. But what’s even better is that something about them shows their unique personalities and characters. Amazing!
Am i the only one that thinks this looks terrible
Music please
Ok ich hab Bock!
…different colors made of tears…
From the looks of it, this production might be to GoT what Mandalorian was for Star Wars.
If Only GOT was successful, THIS WOULD'VE BEEN A TREAT...
hey hbo is this releasing in india through disney plus hotstar like game of thrones?
Long live Rhaenyra Targaryen, the next Daenerys Targaryen
Fuckn Weak. "And all the dragons roared as one"...  And you DON'T think that'd be a cinematic moment to SHOW US in the trailor ? (rule: show us, don't just tell us) Example:  "Somehow, Palpatine has returned [sound of dog farting]"
🔥 i am you tuber 🔥🔥  मे you tuber हू mera tech channel hai  mere channel se aapka help ho sakata hai
Finally blood and fire😍
Looks amazing. HBO have huge fan base  in India. Must be dubbed in Hindi language.
It's gonna be another disappointment
Barry and Succession, that's it. Everything else is for the masses and average at best.
I hope this show isn't WOKE🤔
Did anyone ask for this?
Dracarus!!!
This looks so interesting I can't wait to watch this masterpiece 🔥
Jesus H Roosevelt Christ we're back...
Can’t Wait!!
I enjoyed Fire and Blood much more than I expected, and while I don't remember a ton of the succession details (definitely had to look up basically every character in this trailer) I am certainly willing to give this a shot.  It has an unparalleled budget and great talent (writing, acting, and directing) attached to it.  Plus, unlike Season 7-8 of Thrones, it's actually based on something written and GRRM has played a pretty big part in it. I'm hopeful.  Do we know how many seasons are planned? Or is it more of a one-off?
I hope they decide to finish this one. It was sad that they just stopped GOT.
It’s up to you to make your life. Take what you have and stack it up like a tower of teetering blocks. Build your dream around that i believe in you!!!
Damn season 8  killed my enthusiasm for anything GoT but still, it looks a thousand times better than Amazon's LotR and I will give it a chance for sure
I do not think this show is going to be woke. I can see women fighting in a different way. Last season of GOT were so bad, and the characters were so annoying, for example Lyanna Mormont. She was so annoying "I will not be by the fire; I will fight." 🙄 basically telling grown man to shut up. If Joffrey even when he was king had behaved that way, his grandfather would have had sent him to sleep. Unrealistic annoying women after season 5 on GOT. Now first seasons of GOT, even though is fantasy, it felt more natural , and we could relate to many characters. Women seasons 1-4 were so cool. Anyway I think women on this show are going to be cool, different, unique. Not annoying woke first world feminist, and about the men I cannot imagine Daemon saying over and over: I don't want, my queen...🙄 Corlys is a Velaryon. He is not a Targaryen. He will be a master of the sea, not a dragon rider, and I think the cast is perfect. He looks so cool. Viserys, Daemon, Rhaenyra and Alicent casts I believe will make us all very happy. I am already in love with all of them.
Trash. Trash. Trash. And the blonde queen isnt even hot this time.
What do you mean, He ( You know who ) will be the King of Iron Throne in this series, too?
Is this an orchestral cover of Venus In Furs by The Velvet Underground?
2:23 Caraxes has armor on, but 200 years later they couldn't think of that.
Who cares.
Can't wait for all the incest scenes
Apart from the Starring everything seemed Spectacular
All of this to become bran the king😣
to people who hated season 8 ending how whould you ended i was wondering
ПОВЕСТОЧКА
WIll this series show Aegon's Conquest at some point, or is it a different time period?

I like the way they are showing dragons in this series. 🔥🔥🔥
Just make sure you use the same damn GOT intro song. If you change it, you are on your own. WE WILL SKIP IT.
But i want to see more White walkers? 🥲🥲🥲
Widać różnorodność smoków, good.
I'm cooming
It's hard to care about prequels to begin with.  In this case, knowing how it eventually ends, it's hard to care at all.
I don't know why hbo not made hindi version
I don’t think y’all understand how excited I am for this!!!!
War is a 🦶 ???
This looks sick 😍
Don't forget the trailer of GoT season 8 was awsome too.
Looking forward to it.
Is it Vhagar end of trailer ?
❤️❤️❤️♥️♥️♥️🔥🔥🔥
Looks good. I'm gonna watch it!
Indian fans!! the background score has been copied from Bahubali
This looks really great! I think it will be better for the sheer fact that they are working with a completely finished story this time; no excuses to derail into fan-fiction writing territory like what happened with GoT post-season 4!
is that Prince Caspian
So music for trailer is terrible...
I know it is starting in the UK on August 22nd. There was an advertisement on Sky TV earlier for it.
Can we just get the Snyder cut of the last season please?
Its another bait an switch, there going to keep the woke to a minimum in the trailer to get subscribers but after a few episodes get ready for the "message" which will include gays trans pocs incompatent evil white males and a topping of feminist flavor. It the typical hollywood playbook in 2022
This looks like witcher, which isnt promising at all
.
REMAKE GOT SEASON 8
House of woke.
CHILLS
I very much worry that this new series is gonna be the same quality as GoT seasons 7 & 8, but I sure do hope it has the quality of seasons 1-5.
You can now learn High Valyrian on Duolingo...I guess I won't be needing Subtitles now. 😂
TOO BAD THEY DIDN'T MAKE THIS BEFORE GAME OF THRONES :/
We still remember what you´ve done to Game of Thrones. You´ve ruined all my joy for the whole GoT world. May your service loose every single costumer if this show is anything but the very freaking best thing ever to be filmed.
Billion for a stupid film but not for a poor people around the world in this crisis.
Im so done with the female empowering bs, hard pass on this woke crapfest.
I don't know if I feel right but I feel there is a feminists agenda on the account of dramatic value.
Is that Vhagar at the end or Syrax?? I think it’s Vhagar? Vhagar is bronze with green eyes? Syrax is yellow with amber eyes right?
No one old character..... That's not good
Who did the background score?
Why do I get a Morbinvibe with this video
looks like a garbage british telenovela where the woman is again the smartest, fairest, bravest of all beings
"Somehow the Dothraki returned."
WE WANT ALL  R.R MARTIN'S WORK ON LIVE SCREEN PLAY ALL THE BOOKS EVEN THE REIGN OF AEGON TARGARYEN REIGN
i'm going to be fair , this is just a trailer , so i'll give them the benefit and say this is not the final product . because if this is the final product then GOT's dragons are still the best looking dragons in cinema history .
aga ne oluyor aga

Fix game of thrones first you hackfrauds! Prequels don't matter if you know it will eventually all result in a bad ending!
Hindi me bi  dub kr dooo
Sorry fellas but these dragons resemble lizards 🦎  Not Dragon early breed 🐉🐲
Dragons are on point as usual in GOT
They are out of book source material this will be like the last crappy seasons of GOT.
Just can't get excited for this considering how botched the tail end Thrones was when they ran out of spoon fed story and character development. The production value is there, so there is that, I guess. And what is with that black Targaryen guy? They are all white as snow. Is it just a race swap because diversity???
Tbh...I expected better cast
No night king ... No GOT Period.
Came here to see the comments made by the hype bots. Wasn't disappointed.
Hindi version nahi aayega kya?
That dragon looks badass.
SO HYPED!!!!!
Визуал не плох, повесточка с хорошими и сильными женщинами и плохими, тупыми мужчинами выбешивает. Да и как же я мог забыть про негра таргариена. Это уже дичь полная. Драконы хороши.
واو كثير متحمسه 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Copying game of thrones
looks shite
The music is too distracting. Trusr the written dialog and let us hear it please.....turns in cc.
Love the music too! I have a feeling it can be an iconic theme like GOT
Okay I'm sold.
Can't wait to hear the OST from Ramin.
Nobody asking why they made the entire Velaryon family black for no other reason than diversity?  “It was very important for Miguel and I to create a show that was not another bunch of white people on the screen, And it also reflects our modern world so much better in what is still ultimately a fantasy realm." It's very jarring and immersion-breaking. I don't want to watch T'Challa played by Scarlett Johansson.
I can't wait!!!!
Why couldnt the son be the heir?
Sweet! More race swapping and story adjustments to fit today's super awesome woke culture 🙄😒
Welcome to my channel 🙏🏻 Please help me 🙏🏻 tag channel my channel killer Akash 19k please

Is this based on dance of the dragons
waaaaaaaav !!! ab toh hamou bhi dekhnge yeh series
is that last dragon supposed to be Sunfyre?
Looks like poor version GoT with addition of more "variet" cast
Its gonna be the incredible web series of the year 👌
BGM THERI
The scars from the final season of GoT runs deep, I hope this is the ointment that cures it. chant wait
Please let this not be the debacle that was the ending of game of thrones
Hope they dont end up like got
Meh not hyped not a compelling trailer at all. Maybe highlight 2-3 main characters at least.
ممتاز 🤩
ممتاز 🤩
yesssss go crazy like yo mama
KAREN! ti sto cercando ovunque, surespot é una merda ....spero di trovarti
Looks woke
This will be epic! Am already rooting for Daemon Targeryan as my favourite character 🤣🤣
HBO the only streaming service worth having!
Please upload in hindi language
Upload in hindi dubbed
Looks good. Hopefully there's more than just one black person in the series. There has to be. Where did he come from?
This time I'll wait for the series to end and then start watching it. GOT broke me.
Is that The Velvet Underground´s Venus in Furs in the theme of the song?? I don´t know if that would be stealing or just being genius...
At 1:48 Vhagar's foot?
Ummmmm, where is Balerion? I only want to see that beast for the entire season
Nice to see how HBO paid Indians en Philippines to like and post here. Check all the buzzwords they use
Droped a like becasue from what i have heard, yes they wanted to put a black character there but it makes sense with the world and lore, and if it is realistic i dont mind and can actually be good But please make an ancient series about ancient afrikan kingdoms, most of people dont know them and think afrika was all tribes
What's with the white haired orcs?
As long as it is not a woke of thrones, I’m fine with it.
don't forget how they ended game of thrones, can't even check the shots for starbucks cups - literally wouldn't pass for an undergraduate project at RISD
It looks Amazing
#الدم_اغلى
Not enough not enough 🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴 we want GOT season 9 , where bran turns evil and Jon comes back with dragon to take the throne 😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈 we want something like that .......................
Look at how woke it is with all the black people that weren't in the novels. SMFH
Looks good. So did the end of GoT. I just hope they have a plot and characters that are not garbage.
Aprenda Amazon Prime!
I can’t emphasize enough the importance to quality and detail and how crucial it is to the success of a tv show/movie. So glad they’re throwing the same quality into this as GOT
which timeline is this
Man what a feel after so many years!... My heart pounded by seeing the iron throne! 😵😵
Too much in the trailer but still hype asf
Targaryens are not black people! I have watched GOT (1st to 6th season) 5 times and will watch it again!! GOT is a superb series, a true masterpiece if you never watch 7th and 8th seasons! I accepted that this series were not going to have any ending and just enjoyed the first 6 seasons for their beautiful cinematography, very intelligent dialogues, and outstanding acting/performances! Now, this woke ideology is already poisoning a prequel, which should live up to the marvelous GOT (1st to 6th seasons)! This hatred toward “white people” is a disease that is destroying great shows and movies, only to send a bitter message of resentment and disdain for another racial group! These woke people are doing exactly what they claim to be fighting against! They are a bunch of HYPOCRITES!!

Ooh yes please 👍

Seriously ...l stop watching anything after GOt ended .. now here's new treat
August 21 ?
I've got exactly one month to read Fire and Blood.  I'll definitely like to compare and contrast with the Series. The trailer looks amazing. Can't wait!.
Nah, they should have put the money into a proper GoT ending (maybe a few more seasons). And to be fair, i dont even like the look of this show.
All form and most likely little content. This too will end in disappointment. That simply is GRRM's M.O. Write aimlessly into the night without any inkling where things are going. It is incredible that some people still have not figured out his cheap gimmick!
Rhys Ifans ❤
I still have a bad taste in mouth from the last season of game of thrones. Yeah I know it’s different people but HBO still okayed it. I’ll check this out but I’m not holding my breath just looks like game of thrones but with Targaryens
Meh.
you guys think we'll see Balerion in flashbacks? would be awesome to see the melting of Harrenhaal
Epic
Season 8 was so bad, I am almost turned off by this. Wtf is wrong with me.
Since we all know how  mishandled this story ends up, I have no interest in this.....

I'm very Happy and excited , I ❤it. Unique designs of the dragons, each dragon has it's own shape they all look amazing. Visually Stunning!
will the next move be changing the ending of the last season of GOT?

background music....goosebumps😍😍😍
Chills 💯
I don’t like women in power call me old school or just call me realistic
It looks like it's set about 2 weeks before Game of Thrones, not 200 years
🐉🔥🐉🔥🐉🔥#TEAMGREEN 🐉🔥🐉🔥🐉 Don’t argue with me argue witcha mama . Actually argue with thousands of years of established male primogeniture in Westeros minus the Principality of Dorne
My "Woke" senses are tingling
I wonder if they'll show who was the 3 Eyed Raven in this timeline.
Honestly after GOT`s S8 poor delivery(and ending) i have to say this does look pretty great. The dragon designs look pretty cool and the trailer itself looks to be pretty good aswell. I will give this show the benefit of the doubt... but please no more seasons like S8 please.
Black targaryens and pangender mexican dragons that identify as as demisexual chairs.. and gender politics pfff.. give me a break. Go ahead hollyweird,keep throwing your money out the window cause normal people will never accept this garbage. You will be the ones to go broke
하 존나 재밌겠다. 40대 되면 왕겜 다른 프리퀄 볼 수 있는 건가? ㅋㅋ
I recognize that soundtrack. That's Velvet Underground by Venus in Furs. I love singing that at karaoke.
Was that a black Targaryen? One of those series's then...
GOT is one of the greatest series I have ever watched. And I feel greatful for it.
Hi
We miss the classic bgm
No non no. You're not going to f**k me over again. I will never forgot season 8. Bye.
EYEROLLING SHITE, SURE THOSE TARGARNYS WERE ALL WHITE, NOT BLACK, The direater saying not wanting a whole bunch of white people on screen wont help, looks abit wokey, numbers wont be high
I want this to succeed and end properly pls don’t let us down
I am very excited to see this finally come to screens. I read then entire fire and blood, a world of ice and fire, the Rouge prince and "the princess and the queen" to know as much about this time period as possible. Most people don't know about it which is genuinely upsetting. And the asoiaf community is in desperate need of fresh blood. Who knows this might even improve the image of the targs. Though I have doubts regarding that.
Their genetics (inbreeding), unique fire-resistant, dragon sensitive gene is all very much a part of their story and having some random blacks in there contradicts the very foundation of what "being a Valyrian" means. Their skin color beyond factors into it, it's the very essence of it. They are conceptually hyper pale super aryan inbred supremacists, it is literally, factually, objectively what they are. They view everyone else with disdain. This is thrash
It would be nice to see some old characters too.
The Doctor?!
Next in line is a dragon with scales in the lgbt flag colours 🤣 the trailer looks good anyway
this looks stupid af ngl feels like they are scared to explore something new within the franchise in fear of completely losing their audience after the last season of GOT
I don't want to admit it, but I will: despite the GoT's crappy ending that massively disappointed me, I still want to watch this one.
If u dare make this a woke show HBO.
Old is gold still no competition to GOT yet hope this would at least maintain its name.
This is going to be really good
I can't wait to see this. A bit of a nitpick. Although each of the dragons have unique designs, it still needs more improvement.
And then they will absolutely massacre the final season. Runs in the family. 🔥
I haven't watched GOT, Will HOTD accept me?
the audience remembers
This is on another level!!!! this is what George deserves for his books, spectacular!!!!
When HBO Max will be available in Germany 🇩🇪?
Bring on the dragons, bring on the throne, bring us a worthy heir, so ready for this!!!!
0:54 جون ابروزي؟
jajajajaja qué es esto?
Now that looks amazing!
This is a great photo of Nancy Pelosi flying in to Washington DC
The music 😍
The dragons look so good because the design of each one is based on real dragons.
Is it me or does the one dude look like Vego Carpathia from ghost busters 2 🤣
Looking from the cast it will be disappointing 😅. I hope they do well though . It would be a shame
Game of Wokes XD
Hope the ending is as crap as GOT
Who's the black guy?
Daemon Targaryen: dreams didn’t make us kings, dragons did Daenys Targaryen: Am I a joke to you?
Great reworking of Venus in Furs by The Velvet Underground for the music here. Check it out if you're not familiar.
Hopefully ist better than the last season of got.
To state that this looks head and shoulders above the LOTR-show is understatement of the year. I just hope it comes close to touching GoT at its peak.
Release in Hindi too.
Rhaenyra and Dany aren almost twins , i Guess they are playing with our feelings about Dany, I'm loving You rhaenyra
given how I've seen the show ended, not excited to watch prequels.
Denjar sin
Dragons looking kinda cartoony, like How to Train Your Dragon or smth, hoping this is still a bit rough
no thanks
Amazon take notes….
Never thought id like a prequal. Not after how they massacred the last season of GOT. Im watching it yes!!!!
I told myself I wouldn’t let them drag me back in. Well I’m back in. August 21 I’m in Westeros bring on the fire and blood !
thanks for showing the whole series. Saves a lot of time!
So there were black Targeryans with silver dreadlocks? What?
Look at those dragons 😍😍😍😍😍. They’re simply OUTSTANDINGLY GORGEOUS 🐉❤️. This production indeed shall redeem the shame that Game of Thrones brought on the last season. The casting looks awesome, full of great actors. The costume design is on point 👌. And the soundtrack does justice to the mighty of the most powerful house of all Westeros 🤘❤️. Can’t wait to see the first episode 😍
I hope they have a epic musical score just like GOT. Edit : they could have had a different song. 👀
Okay now Im ready to say it, I'll be waiting for this so much more than Rings of Power
Omg I’m obsessed that they used Venus in Furs Velvet Underground as the background, I’m mind blown!!!
All this for Bran to be king
missing GOT so much & this trailer looks promising —excited to get to know the targaryens more [as they go berserk] & ofc, really really looking forward to seeing the dragons when they’re still more than a handful
Bring the night king back to this series
Not again☺️ I'm still in the mourning by the death of queen Daenerys😒
I  hate HBO max he's hypocrite dictator
Please don’t be woke  Please don’t be woke Please don’t be woke
1:03 wow that’s one serious dragon neck!
looks good but looks can be deceiving
This better not be like season 8 of GOT.
Can't Wait ☺️
This got half the views of The Rings of Power’s teaser from a week ago in a single day.
Please don't ruin this show with woke politics.
Please tell me that’s not a black Targaryen hahaha how ludicrous

Oh
Looks nice but Ill just wait for the show to end and decide if its worth my time then. Fool me once HBO...
I hope jon snow is in this
Just like it's predecessor, it will be another failure....as a reminder of the final season of GoT: only got one episode for the battle of winterfell, something that was built up for the entire series; not to mention the anticlimactic ending of the White Walker storyline that had also been built up for seven seasons. The final season also shortchanged the women of Westeros, sacrificing satisfying character arcs for spectacular set-pieces in a mad dash to get to the finish line in just six episodes. Benioff and Weiss decided to put their time and energy into Star Wars, which is why season 8 was not good at all. Remember the petition signed by 1.7M fans to HBO calling Benioff and Weiss, woefully incompetent writers, and to remake all of season 8.
Wait, the queen loses though right? Because there never was a female queen on this iron throne before GOT????
Looks so good 😊
i'm so lostl...
Pretty gay.
✨THIS SOUNDTRACK ✨
Plz provide also in hindi
Tyrion Lannister. He was amazing in Games of Thrones
I would be interested if the last two seasons of Game of Thrones were remade, but I still have the taste of salt on my lips.
Everyone is so pretty and clean!
Which side are you on Blacks or the Greens ? #TeamBlack
It will be woke, with all the edgy aspects that made the first few seasons of GoT so good, missing.
Just started to read all the books. The dragons look stellar.
Same writers?
I can't wait to watch this show
Im currently rewatching GOT🥰🥰  im on season 2 episode 3 😊😊
Feminist garbage why im not surprised lmao
Hopefully is makes up for the disappointing season 8.
All the bots are obsessed with the different dragons and their supposed “unique” designs. Lol. What are you trying to push on us HBO?
Hope this one doesn't have a disappointing ending.
Yes I am going to watch this!
Lol why are there black people.in this
No thanks
اكو عرب في hbo
Will the creative process pick up where GOT ended? Will this be as bad as Rings of Power?
Amazinggggggggg can’t wait
Why do so many top comments seem to be all in relation to how well and distinct each of the dragons look? How interesting.............................................................................not!
Is it only me or anyone else also feels like this still doesn't give the " game of thrones vibe " ....can only wait

Strange how all negative comments are filtered out and thumbs up go over hundreds in hours,lol,doesn't happen to year old comments
HEY HOW LONG TAKE IT WATCH THAT IN GERMANY
Watching this for the dragons... and the royal drama
A black targaryen? What is this?`
I will watch because dragons
This is just pissing over Amazons Lord of Diversity series
THE HYPE IS BACK!!!
Daemon targaryen will be legendary cuz he is favourite character for RR Martin in all his world .  Rhaenyra is the mix of  bold  Danny and  smart cercey together 🔥🔥🔥✊
Unless this is written by the OG.G. himself I'm not interested 🙄
The last 3 seasons of GoT sucked all the interest out of me about these stories...
Is this before or after the storyline of GOT?
I could care less about this show Martin needs to work on his book rather than having fun no one asked for this and no one wants this
feels like it's going to be trash like seasons 5-8
Instaboner!!
I hope alba is not a Targaryen wouldn’t make much since seeing as they inbred with each other would be kinda stupid to force a black guy into that role for diversity sake
I'm so done with GOT.
Zzz...
Why prequel when I already seen the sequel 😡
Ill be happy if I see Aegon dominating everyone before all of this drama
0:59...ugh why do they always think we need a cheesy lovestory, because this is clearly what is about to happen.
This is really Badass 🔥
Cannot wait man!!
How many times are they gonna say The Iron Throne???
0:12 Death of Maegor Targaryen
It does feel kinda like a knock off version of the witcher series. I hope the actual show will be better than this trailer.
So the targaryans are black now? lol
I think this dragon has died in the Hobbit series.
Breathtaking. This looks so good, so promising. Can't wait for August!
This series is the reason why HBO rushed GoT. We would need to be very naive to expect HBO to have a minimum of respect with the books or the audience this time.
David Cavill from Witcher could've be the Best Choice for Targareyan
Warum sieht die Hälfte der Charaktere nach billigem CGI aus -,-
Looks like trash
I know a lot of people had a lot of negative things to say about GoT....its gonna be weird to see different characters outside of the dragons, but I honestly canNOT wait for this to air!
That green dragon that only showed the claw is vhagar, so big, wonder if balerion will appear in a flashback
Lord of the rings
Wow, watching those hives dissolve every day until they disappear is definitely appeasing, I went with what I commented about and after 20 or so days the urticaria’s history, I simply go'ogled the latest by Shane Zormander and now my skin is as smooth and healthy as it has ever been!
ماذر دراكون 😔💗
I AM SCREAMING OMG THE DRAGONS 😍
The music sounds like Ninja Tracks, Dead Walking which was used in one of the Game of Thrones season trailer. Looking forward to this.
Look who is coming 👀 Dragon again 😉
This looks terrible. We all know why.
This looks so much better than rings of power
Again a woman empowerment propoganda
hopefully this redeems the show after that mediocre last season
SO XCITEDXDD
looking forward to it
I AM READY TO BE HURT AGAIN
Lmao @ black velaryons. Bring on the asian Blade
Is this like a prequel or something?
5.2 million views less than 24 hours.    But no one is going to watch this right? Lol
i dunno......
Long Life The Fire
The male Targaryens are supposed to be as good looking as the female ones. What a dissappointment.
Way, way better than the Rings of Power. And much less expensive as well. Keep it up HBO.
For those curious about which dragons appeared: Syrax 0:33, 1:34, 1:56, and 2:29 Caraxes 1:46, 2:23 Seasmoke (presumably) 2:17 Vhagar 1:48
Graham Mctavish as Kings Guard?? I see they did fantastic job with casting, just like GOT. One thing I can't complain about GOT is casting.
I wish we could see Balerion in House of the dragon! Too bad that we most probably won’t… or maybe? I still have hope haha🫣
Season 8 GOT was awesome.  Fight me
So many comments talking about the visuals of this trailer but absolutely none addressing what killed the entire GoT in the first place - the storyline.  Visuals set aside, this storyline given looks nothing like a generic meh with some copypaste going back to the last 2 seasons of GoT added to this series.
"House of the feminist" I am thrilled to be skipping this nonsense.
Trailer looks insane
Vhagar better be godzilla level dragon here not some miniature wyvern.
Diversity = NOT watching.  enjoy lower ratings and losing the entire asian market
Any white walkers in this?
It was a great experience for double negative crew. ❣️
It's not easy for to match the level of game of thrones
"and all the dragons roared as mine" is biblical lore to soloman and his ability to control demons.......
I will give House of the Dragon a chance, but I am scared to really invest time into any HBO show after Game of Thrones failed as a series so spectacularly. I really hope they have done right by their viewers this time around.
Nah I'll wait.  Your doing this for more cash and I have very little faith
Can you please stop talking about Game of Thrones? Thank you Posser.
lol dont care
Looks cool. Final season of GoT also "looked cool".
This is hindi dubbed ?????
This is everything I wanted!! Bring on all the Family drama and politics! 🔥 🍷
guess i'll watch it until the last season. not watching the last season. never.
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
This trailer is a masterpiece and it feels like I’m watching an episode of Game of Thrones. The quality, the visuals, the everything- it looks amazing! I am so ready for August
This will conclude after 5 seasons, and _Winds of Winter_ will still not be out.
Omg this actually looks good

Black Targaryans / black valyrians even reading book’s when they spoke of old valyrians always felt they’d be black even with the purple eye silver hair stuff

Hate the message of this trailer about how woman can’t do this or do that and man is in control. This narrative screams garbage. If it was not for that it would look phenomenal. Just tired of ideologies being involved in everything.
Despite how Game of Thrones ended we cant deny how amazing the show was before that and how amazing this show can really be. Im really excited
In my dream I'm facking with dragon 🐉🐉😂😂
Why is that one guy black tho
I can't wait to find out who has a better story than Background Extra 143
Honestly..not excited for this.  I'll try to watch it but GOT left such a bad taste in the end. Hopefully these new directors know what to do with this.
I have not read Fire and Blood but I have read The World of Ice and Fire and the ammount of Betrayals, Violence, Cruelty, Epic battles and Debauchery that goes down around the 'Dance of Dragons' can put GOT to shame. I think this might be very good if they stick to the books. I have some doubts that they might delete/merge some characters because there are so many of them and majority of them play vital although very brief roles in the overall scheme of things.  Obviously changing the race of what can be called the cousins of Targaryens is kinda a bummer and Trust me, I am not just saying this out of some out of place racism but rather genuine concern about the story. This somewhat into spoiler territory so those that haven't read fire and blood and/or World of ice and fire should read further with caution but the appearance and inherited features of Rheanyera's Children (with leanor velaryon) are the cause of a major event at one point in the books.
“Maybe if we say ‘succession’ a bunch of times in the trailer people will watch it” 😂
You see the whole House of the Dragon and know how they end - "good riddance".
Can't wait for Fall.........College and Pro football kick off again *full steam* .....the Holidays return...........and a new Game Of Thrones Series explodes onto the screen. *Can't wait for Fall* .
Just Release it Already 😭😭😭
I really can’t see myself getting excited for this after season 8
<333333333333333333
the soundtrack is growing on me idk
Syrax looks so cute
Release date pls??
Respect from Algéria 🇩🇿❤️🔥
I like the one with the white hair.
Another disappointment, we will see a vast story that ends with short and illogical ending.
The dialogue wasnt particulary breathtaking in parts but that may come in context or because you people hold back.  Else; This is well edited, VERY well shot and looks very promising.  A welcome surprise after the atrocious Rings of Power trailer.
SPOILER:     In the end it doesn't really matter, because Bran the Broken will end up as King anyway..🤷🏼‍♂️
Dear Amazon hacks writing The Rings of Power. This is how you make a trailer: you've hint what the story's going to be about, you show the main players and define the main conflicts. Now, I have no idea if tHofD is going to be good but I am looking forward to find out. You, on the other hand, only have so far succeeded to show how wonderfully diverse your cast is.
I love how they gave each commenting bot a different personality. They really seem like real people.
Too hot! Too good! Fire will reign! 🔥 "Dracarys!" 🐉
It's so weird to see the actor playing Milo in the movie ever made play one of the main characters in House of Dragons
Can't wait!!
<3
Oh my god! 🥰💙💥💥
01:47  Balerion right there yay
""""I Respect every one who were involved in this, seriously the best piece that I've ever seen on YouTube, hats off to well all  ! Love your videos  🤯🤯🤯🤯😱😱🥳🎃
Extremely Super duper exited for this Epic marvelous Show 😘😘😘 🥵🥵🥵🔁
<3
I'm happy all the comments are all so happy. "Okay Google, show me all the normal people comments" I don't like echo chambers. Where are all the "hot garbage" comments?
What are stakes? You did the white walkers dirty, How do you think this will be any better? Hope it gets cancelled from the first episode.
No one wants to watch this multiculturalism trash
"your family has dragons" my family have a pug with a smelly fart...
Can't wait to see the story come to life.
I personally won’t be watching because I feel like the story has already been told several times. The history being too close to the events of GOT , and we already know what happened , how it happened and how it ended. What I personally would have liked , was them to have actually made The Long Night work. A much more interesting timeline with how everything started from the beginning.
Something i was not prepared to say: This is going to eat the lotr garbage they're pushing
Worlds between the Trailer from Lord of the rings and this. This Trailer is a masterpiece for sure!
This should turn out great...
Game of Cringe
Im hyped about the show but the trailer is pertty avg.
pure goosebumps
This is gonna be an epic year for series. House of the Dragons and Rings of Power of Amazon, holy moly, it's gonna be amazing!!!!
Que mierda es esto? Got? Naaa🥱
HBO is requested not crush spirit of fans this time. I hope my voice will be heard accordingly.
Without White Walkers but Dragons 😏
My family ❤️wow
No aguanto para ver las escenas de desnudos innecesarias    #Humor 🌚
Iam YouTube par 🥀🥀Ami Tamatar heap kurte Pari
Waiting series 😍❤😍 Iam show happy
Really looking forward to this!!
Daemon looks dangerous I love it
I think I am the only one who's not hyped at all. 😅😂
gives me chills
Do they have Martin material if they don't the show is doomed
l am youtuber
I see the other houses and their westrosy Lords got marginalized , and all of the spot lights is on the Targaryens and their internal issues
Original is original, this new show cannot beat GoT.
Looks mid tbh
Ima just say it, I came in my pants
You will see more dragons in the trainer than the actual show.
why are there so many black people for no reason
Background score is going to be epic
Looking forward to this, only thing that is weird to me is that a valerian is dark of skin.  Seems unnecessary blackwashing to me since there are powerful dark skinned character everywhere already.
Caraxes looks like a Monstrous Nightmare if they made a live-action How To Train Your Dragon. Yikes…
So glad my man ewan mitchell is in this series
I`m gonna watch this only for the dragons designs, because core of game of thrones, whole lore SUCKS!!!
I'll wait until the saga ends, if people say it's worth watching, then I'll watch. I'm not that impressed with the trailer.
This trailer came on as an ad and made me stop what I was originally watching to come here. Simply amazing.
Take a shot every time they mention the Iron Throne
So, they really are thinking about a series post GoT also?
Love it
its on witch ott platform?  and its in hindi available ?
Is it releasing in India also 😳  .
Something gives me the feels of this series is going to be different than GOT (In a good way). A lot of people at that time didn't know about the books during the launch of GOT. Either ways, I am excited.
Strong white women and diverse males are the good guys. Straight white male are always the bad guys.
Whos excited for the Rings of Power series more than this?
Lord of the ring s is the OG I hope it kills this show!!
Looking forward to seeing possible biological mother of Dany's dragons, Dreamfyre, the pale-blue dragon. Since Elissa stole 3 of her eggs and sold it in Bravos during Jaehaerys' reign, there is a chance Dreamfyre is the mother of Dany's dragons. And since Dreamfyre will be in HOTD because Helaena is riding her, they could mention this incident of egg stealing or design Dreamfyre in such a way that she is structurally similar to Dany's dragons, then that will be a hint to the mystery of Dany's dragons' parentage.
I can’t wait 🥹🥹🥹
That one dragon, reddish in color,that's Caraxes correct?
Looks like GOT, sounds like GOT, feels like GOT, but the same goes for the last seasons of the original show, and they weren't real GOT either. They can show as many dragons and say "the iron throne" as often as they want... I'll wait for how the SCREENPLAY turns out to be.
dat black dude with a blonde hair… just wtf
Where is Mushroom ? 😂
Murzyn blondyn :D ja pierdole! :D
No dragons no war scenes but the political drama's and music this is what my demand and trailer giving this.
Nice Video

There's a White Mop on the Black guy's head! Haha!
My expectations: Dragons,dragons,dragons Nude,nude,nude....
Men bad women good, we get it ur ticking boxes hbo
Waiting 🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Why do they insist on miscasting?
Keep in mind that Vhagar is almost the size of Balerion by this time...   Drogon would be tiny next to them...
Dragons look dramatic! But am I just the one who thinks they look too graphic?
Can't wait drop it now biatch
aren't the Targaryens should be  livin up up in a floating palace?
Dragons!!!🔥
Can we have a transgender dragon I mean ur changing stuff from the books in the show so why not a dragon
That's a lot to take
High Hope's
what the black guy is doing in this
Does this have scourge material
I hope it wont be bad as got s8
wen series of Other Houses???
I will not be paying for an HBO subscription to watch this. And no I'm not pirating either.
Did George sign off on this?
Why are there so many video artifacts even on 1080p?
It's a pity that dragons are not from Game of Thrones. There they looked bigger and cooler.
Hindi dubbed please
Is Brandon Stark going to pop up out of nowhere and sit on the throne in the last episode?
Too much...
It's clearly visible they have continued with the vibe of GOT and the complexity is there too.💀
Doctor Who Middle Earth edition?
Black Dude married with white woman lol, a woker version of GoT.
I feel like a battered spouse coming back to an abusive relationship.
SUPERB
Amazing 🔥🔥🔥🔥
VHAGAR IS HERE !!!!!!!!!
Stop the whines of how GOT got "worse" in the later seasons, or how "bad" the ending was.  Bloody self-entiitled strawberries...  that was the way the creators did, for good and for worse, and it is done.  You want a different ending you go write it yourself, go fund the whole re-shoot yourself (as if you are capable enough to get anyone to put money on you).
😎
Hopefully they make us forget the botched ending of the original series
It gives me a lot of 'woke' vibes.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I'll hold my judgement for now, but I'm hesitant to give this a go. S08 of GoT was a trainwreck and I'm hesitant to trust the people behind this again (even with those original two bozos removed). Aside for George R. R. Martin, the other creator of this show is the guy that wrote Dwayne Johnson's Hercules and Rampage, which were both guilty pleasure shut your brain off movies at best...
Esta serie sera épica . game of throne siempre logra sumergirte en su mundo.
Watch out for the bricks on the ceiling.
I don't know why I'm here, I haven't even finished Season 3 Episode 10 yet
House of the CGI
So another story just like the last. Great. I’ll watch, but this really needed another unique story line instead just another version of the same story.
The music 🎶 sounds amazing!
Sambavam Starts🔥🔥🔥
Oh snap! Prince Charles coming for that throne.
Why can't they just let it rest. No. Just no.
I don't expect much after those last few stinker seasons of GoT.
Esto se ve increíble!
I'm going to be one of those people... The book Fire and Blood is way better.
damn you HBO, damn you (orders HBO again after a long spell)
💜🌾
So excited
"Venus in Furs" as the theme. How nice!
Goosebumps 💨
This is gonna be so bad. Matt Smith is such a crappy actor. They're not even giving this a chance.
Rhaenys is already my favorite
As someone who actually did enjoy most of season 8 I can barely contain my excitement for this.
Can’t wait to see Vhagar. The last remaining dragon from the days of Aegon the Conqueror.
my love
His armor looks INSANE!! IDK why they didn't do the dragon wing helm in GoT... I'm so amped for this..
Where is duty ? Where is sacrifice? Where is Jon Snow ??😁😁
So it´s gona be a jealousy drama about who´s gona be on the Iron throne!!? Hmmm sounds familiar.
one tale ends another begins👍
meh
Oh my GOD, this trailer is good. I might be tempted into watching the show.  Viserys: I have decided to name a new heir Daemon: I am your heir Viserys’ soft voice, Daemon’s cockiness, the TENSION in the air… everything is so on point.  Otto: Our hearts remain as one (camera pans out to show Rhaenyra and Alicent praying together, and then the scene changes, and they’re seated far apart) Alicent: Our hearts were never one  Rhaenys to Alicent: Have you never imagined yourself on the iron throne? (Oh, because she has.)  These lines… the editing… I’m seriously shook.
We need tamil dubbed
Will this erase the anger I still carry over the ending of GoT? Let’s wait and see
I see Doctor Who has decided he wants to mess with the GOT timeline cause he too was upset with the last 3 season's
Thank HBO for a such good masterpiece!
forced interracial relationship. kinda cringe
The Dance of Dragons does have it's own short story called  "The Princess and the Queen" its in a book called Dangerous Women if anyone is interested
Honestly, season 8 made me dislike everything to do with game of thrones. I have no interest in this universe anymore and won’t watch unless the reviews are outstanding
Sambavam iruku🔥
Is it available in hindi
I feel happy for George R.R Martin to see all the years he spent writing these books to see them come alive. Props to him and the team for making this possible.
It’s gonna be epic and I think I am ready to forgive game of thrones seasons 8 and move on in life.
Who's the lady in green dress who's vying for the targaryen throne despite not being one like is she someone's wife
Well... 5 million people are about to subscribe to HBO for 1 month XD
Soo exciting 😍
This is from robert rebelion?
The background score gives me chills..
Finally a good trailer for this show
Finally!!! this trailer is awesome! Can't wait to watch on August 21st.
Anyone got the link for this song used in the trailer 🥰😍
Strong female character and Strong diversity character on scene.
She cant be the queen since Daenerys was the first queen (she literally said it herself).
Ok I am gonna fall in love with Matt Smith again
looks amazing
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
isn't that Ned Stark?
So the entire series is based on the question if a woman can become queen. yeah, ill pass. Not to mention the ridiculous diversity casting.
Bhai please help karo 2k kara do bhai please
They explained the storyline in the trailer....
Finally we can see ..the dance of dragons ✨✨
I dont feel the hype for this show as others do, although I am willing to give it a chance. I'm more excited for the Jon snow sequel because his character should have had a better ending and I hope the show gives us that
This will be a flop
Fire and blood 🤩🤩🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Feels like GOT but with Targaryen focus as opposed to Stark focus. I don't think Targaryen's will be as good protagonists as the Stark's though. All fire and no ice.
I don’t think they said iron throne enough in this trailer
It looks good, it just sucks because we all know how it will end because of GoT…which ruined it all. I’ll still watch it though.
Особенно в ролике прикольно "ON AUGUST 21" при дате публикации "20 июля 2022") Хотя рассовое и гендерное разнообразие тоже неплохое, но... уже приелось, уже не вставляет.
I didn't understand much.... But I liked it!!!
I just hope they keep the mortality of characters. Something on this is screaming plot armor.
Much awaited series in the world 👌
4 different dragons spotted awesome!
got bored halfway through the trailer…
Stop with the Color coded casting. No blacks would ever be there. What’s next black Superman. Black Batman. Black Abe Lincoln
HBO India plzz , I want this series in hindi😭😭😭
I like that they showed Blackfyre, I can't wait for them to make replicas.
All this talk about a queen on the iron throne just makes me more pissy about what they did to Daenerys!
God bless you hbo. 🙏🏽 Thanks for the entertainment. 🙏🏽 👍🏼 💕
All the ppl saying how amazing this show looks / will be = HBO employees… 😂😂😂
The thing is I loved game of thrones. And I was happy that it ended, am afraid that house of dragons is gonna kill the good old vibe’s
Fooled me once, HBO.  Never again.
"House Velaryon is of Valyrian descent, and its members often have Valyrian features, such as silver hair, purple eyes, and pale skin."  Here Lord Corlys Velaryon is forcefully depicted as black because.... because some american SJWs would cry otherwise.
Black Valyrians? Im skipping this w0ke fest.
please game of thrones hindi dubbed version
Looks like it won't be very interesting, like it'll make me want to curse HBO for blithely seeking money.
The theme song they Are using is🤌🏻🤌🏻🤌🏻
Is this going to be a mini series or are there going to be multiple seasons?
Here is what that trailer showed me. HBO wants higher income. Well, look to inclusion, partner with the other streaming services, offer an all in one platform, pool your resources for an exclusive inclusive platform.
I loved it. Iam excited 🙋🏻‍♂️
“Evil cannot create anything new, they can only corrupt and ruin what good forces have invented or made" George R.R. Martin, maybe
Are you going to get halfway through the season and moan about the cost of CGI and then stop putting the dragons in it or are you getting the same retarded writers that done season 8 where every character took the last 7 season of character development and through it out the window.
This is going to be so gay.
I just shot 2 loads at once. Looks awesome.
SICKKKKKK
Aïe aïe aïe
I just had a dragasam
Super excited!
A month to go.. Now more Dragon scenes are forth coming  Splendid 💥😊
Well, what about without the black knights, who never existed, like the white Papuans.  When we already see the king-transvestite? Your tolerance is pathetic madness, a huge difference between oppressing and infringing on someone's rights and shoving these unfortunates into all holes at every opportunity, even when it is inappropriate.
I have a good feeling about this
HOTD= HOT Dragons
Let's not mess this one up!
I cant wait for this series and the Lord of the Rings TV Series...
No woke!
Lol.  Not a chance.
woke intensifies. lmao.
I love Matt Smith, but hard pass.
1:47 Is that Balerion The Dreads Foot?
There is no way that in just 300 years, the dragonpit was just the ruin as was shown in the GOT show.
Game of thrones past....... that's the title for me 👍
Music is lit🔥
So they are just re-doing Danny’s story line from the first series? I’ll wait a few seasons to see if they butcher this like they did in season 8.
☝
Looks freaking fantastic! Is it woke tho, cuz I noticed there will be a plotline about a woman making her way among men which sounds very Disney-ish and I don't quite like it. Otherwise, it looks perfect
Get ready for some cool shots and great writing and then they trash it all in the last season! I can't wait for another game of thrones that I'll literally never re-watch ever.
Anybody notice Rhaenyra voice.. it's like emilia's voice 🤩
" When I'm queen, I'll create a new order"   me immediately : f*ck, i hate season 8
❤️❤️🔥🔥
Does not look like anything new to me. More exclusion for money. Give me ad free HBO, Disney+, Paramount+, Prime, Hulu and Netflix on one platform for $85.00, please.
🙄😏🤢
Perfect timing and distance to GoT, I'm ready to get hurt again :D
,##Most awaited 😘😘😌😌
Idk man I smell woke.
This better be a masterpiece and not like the last season of got.
A new war doctor has arrived.
Another Game of Thrones show to skip. I do hope the disappointment by the last season is similar to the OG last season.
I'm losing my confidence मे इतनी  मेहनत करता हूं  गेमिंग वीडियो पर लेकिन कोई छोटे यूट्यूब को सपोर्ट नहीं करता सब स्टार को करते हैं बस😭😭😭😭
Song: Venus in Furs - The Velvet Underground
Yes! Another super inclusive serie that is an ally to the feminist community! This should be great!
Mark my words, the show will disappoint all of you. 😂😂
NOW it looks promising... Can't wait. a month to go...
why the trailer looks like 8 bits
Let ASOIAF die already. Martin already did a long time ago.
0:08 la puerta hace ruido porque no le pusieron aceite o alguna otra cosa 🤣🤣
All I see is the failure of the last 2 seasons of games of thrones.

I love the fact that everyone after season 8 happened everyone just sort of acted like Game of Thrones wasn't the biggest show on the planet for nearly ten years, hopefully House of the Dragon can remind people of that.

Wow Vhagar 😍
Strong wahmen 🤣🤣
Hbo with dem top tier cgi bro on a tv show
This looks good, this looks authentic, I will give it a chance. Please keep the original seasons spirit alive.
At the end of the day, the ending sucks. Might as well know where it starts.
We need ☆Spartans☆ Tv show u hear me HBO & WB?

Having not read the book this looks to be the exact same story as GOT later seasons
meh.
Anybody know what song is playing in the trailer....please lemme know
That BGM from Ramin Djawadi 🖤🖤
I would have preferred to remake the last 2 seasons of the GOT. I am still unhappy with especially the last season. Make GOT Great Again.
this one gonna destroy LOTR on prime
I hope Melisandra is back, so we get to find out who gave her the necklace and why. She really added to the complexity of the GOT plot.
Looks fun! I hope the fans enjoy it! they deserve a encore.. cause of.. well you know.
Oh thank God finally something done well ! Looks amazing .... lol unlike what those bananas have done to LOTR 🤯🤬
How many times did they feel the need to have someone say “iron throne” in this trailer? We got it.
Wait... So, if you join House Targaryen, you need to dye your hair into white? I thought it was in their DNA...
Все хотят сесть на железный трон, это желания и есть проклятие всех
So are they going to rush the final season and ruin the entire show as well?
PLEASE ANYONE HERE HAS THE NAME OF THE SONG ?????????????
I’m so excited
Don’t care. You botched The Long Night story arc.
Never liked prequels! Ground already covered! Forward charge! Swords drawn!
Trash
Goosebumps
The Black Targareyen guy looks like a medieval Sisqo. I expect to hear that Thong Song when I watch this.
Is this "Succession" of Dragons ??

"What is this brief, mortal life..if not the pursuit of legacy?" -  Corlys Velaryon 💎
I really like how each dragon has its own look, they're not basically copied and pasted from one. They seem to all be different sizes and colours which makes this show seem like it's going to pay more attention to the details of the dragons.
OH yeah !!! House of My Queen
Looks so generic. Boring iron throne, politics, feminism,  succession and two very average CGI dragons. Absolutely nothing about this is exciting.
The problem is how can we trust HBO Max ever again after they destroyed GoT in the last two seasons ?  I agree. This trailer looks better (with the exception of the usual identity politics ticking-the-boxes excercises) than the woke LotR  abomination but still...... But contrary to the LotR  abomination which spits on the legacy of the great Tolkien I will at least give this a try.
All the shills and bots pushing this garbage lol
typical woke joke lol
Dracarys
This and lord of the rings will be magnificent
Meh.  You killed all the hype for this series with how you ended the last- people don’t forget.
They had better seriously chart out the story. Targaryen's are my fav house becuz of how insane they are. But I'll still thread with EXTREME caution.
It's  no from me but thanks 4 coming 2day
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
omg omg oomg ommg oooommmmggggg!!! whos with me!
Whamen Stronk! Typical new-age garbage
how many seasons
Fire and blood 🔥🔥🐉.
Make a Hindi dubbed too!!
She  is jullie by euphoria ????? Muito parecida ....irmã gêmea.
Why does Game of Thrones constantly focus on a Taergareyn Mother of Dragons obsessed with the Iron Throne, we all know how that worked last time🐉🐲🐉
Is that ''balerian'' at the end..
Is it necessary to watch Game of Thrones to watch this?
This or the Rings of Power. "War is afoot" or "War is harfoot." Tough choice... NOT!
Hey! Did you know God is three in one!? The Father, The Son, and The Holy Spirit! Bless him! Jesus died for our sins, rose from the dead, and gives salvation to everyone who has faith in him! True faith in Jesus will have you bear good fruit and *drastically* change for the better!
They had to get a black character I seee lol
I need more Dragons...and more violenceee.... in game of targeryans.  I needdd this.
One of the best things about dude is that he never takes credit for himself when he achieves something. He always respect us, the audience and his team, and he is always polite in all of this videos.  We congratulate ourselves on this  achievement  More to come and everything to...

Game of thrones from walmart
Please dubbed Hindi very soon because I  am very excited to see love from India 🇮🇳
Im done with this trop "a woman will not be in power" we have had enough of those now it just keeps on getsi annoying.
DAMN I CAN'T WAIT!!!
ia this based on only one book,? so will rhis have only 1 or 2 seasons
Game of thrones sucks
❤❤🔥👌
🥲🥲🥲🥲
OMG man this is gonna be fire 🔥 let’s get it
I can rest easy knowing that even in fictional westeros They. Was. Kings.
Ciekawe który pierwszy jednych z najlepszych seriali tego roku upadnie, Gra o tron czy Władza Pierścieni,  ale będzie dobrze zająć czas dobrym kinem
She fine!😍😏
prince phillip is that you ?
Lame
I’m Thai and a big fan of GOT. It’s very sad that there’s no HBO max for anyone here to download, we just have HBO go. I can’t wait to see Vhagar, the third biggest dragon.
All i see is dr who ;D
Whoever is reading this, never give up. God is with you
Literally to the 1% who's reading this, God bless you, and may your dreams come true, stay safe and have a wonderful day.
Why there is four legged dragon on the Siegel ?🙂
Take time when telling the story. Like season 1 to 5 in game of thrones.
Why vhagar looking like a dragon from the movie how to train your dragon?🤔
They better not go Woke on this…
Wow the plot sound horrible and generic, and the cgi is atrocious.... I have a bad feeling about this
Anyone else just gonna watch this for the dragons? xD
Theu think the fan base trusts them after seasons 5-8?
Kinda wild this has 22K dislikes
This is how it should be done. Take note Amazon, you really f up Rings of Power. This show is going to be a great watch for sure
HBO’s Black 🪨 House 🏡 of Dragon 🐉 where HBO replace White People with Black 🪨 People and call 📞 it the Black 🪨 House 🏡 of Dragon 🐉 ! HBO’s Black 🪨 House 🏡 of Dragon 🐉 ! Eww… 🤮 ! HBO refuses to adopt Black 🪨 People story but decided to misappropriate House 🏡 of Dragon 🐉 and replace White People with Black 🪨 People and call 📞 it HBO’s Black 🪨 House 🏡 of Dragon 🐉 ! Eww… 🤮
Как может быть чёрный Таргариен? Я не имею ничего против чёрных в кино, но конкретно такая история, а также хоббиты, это не вписывается в тот привычный мир фентези который зрители вже знают. К тому же хоббиты и игра престолов сняты по книгам и в оригинале нет чернокожих. Если бы вышла книга что появляется черные хоббиты это было бы хотя бы оправданно. Но чёрный таргариен это уж слишком, это никак не обоснованно в этом сериале...
🐉🔥🔥🔥🔥🫡
Hey HBO, recast everyone with blonde hair before it's too late. This B-cast looks like Hulu Original extras.
I am still pissed. pass
Get ready to watch hbo production ending not as per public demand
*me wanting to boop the dragon*
This is jumping the shark. No doubt they'll change the phrase to jumping the dragon after this.
“Ohmyyyyfuckingggoodnesss” im hyped af
Why does it feels like its just another generic period drama like The crown..?
Is Balerion the Black Dread still alive during this time period, if so I really hope he’s in this and he’s HUGE
It looks like most of the show was filmed inside a studio with green screens. 😬
Опять лабуду наснимали, по трейлеру уже неинтересно!(
Why is there a black Targ?  That's inaccurate :/
SUMMER IS COMING
Looks fine
HBO has always been king of streaming! 👑
It’s all about the iron throne !
Meh
i'm unbelievably excited, please be insane.
This failed before it even got off the ground. They clearly learned nothing from the last season of GOT.
Love the music. Can't wait. SO HYPED!!!!!
2:31 Mortal Kombat!!!!
Great to see so many British actors... in a show not available to UK audiences (we don't have HBO Max).
Can't wait. 👍
targaryen women are overpowered
WAR is afoot.   I disagree. War is apenis.
I'm only here for the dragons
I am excited to see good ol Robert fight.
Plz release in hindi
do people even care about got after last two seasons?
Hi, i wanna get reply...
1:48 Balerion ?
hopefully seeing the Targaryen civil war story adapted to HBO should be great. the trailer did just focus on Rhaenyra, please follow the book plot and dont just redo Daenerys storyline bc your banking off what you did and know from GOT. Perhaps this first season is focusing on her at the beginning of the dance of the dragons.
Man I miss the theme song... What an epic piece of music was that....
I loved the part where Prince Daemon said: it's throning time and throned all over those guys.
Feels like we have seen that all before
the mad king is supposed to be big and brolic and not goofy like matt smith
looking good hbo
Hopefully they kept the Netfllix woke virus under control
Supreme 🔥🔥🔥 can't wait to watch the show...
Is anyone want to see this after terrible final season of game of thrones? After all, I dont wanna watch anything about GoT maybe I can read but watch something? nah
I wasn’t really thrilled when they cast Matt Smith and, so far, I haven’t seen anything to make me change my mind that he was the right choice. But, I will be tuning in, so I guess we’ll see what we get.
meh , mid
Looks so wack
can someone explain the relation of the show's main characters to the got characters so i get the hang of it? thank uu
Amazon Prime’s LORD OF THE RINGS look better.
Why are all the dragons smaller than season 8 Drogon when they're supposed to be much older than him?
Where did the black Dude come from LOL
And yet it still leads to the crap that was GoT season 8.
Women shouldn’t inherit throne but only Dragons eggs 😂😂. Thats enough
I don't want to speak too soon, but this looks beautiful. I wonder what all the dislikes are about
Is Winter Coming?
I think the Dragon sizes are massive compared to Daenerys’s Dragons
Waiting for this EPIC series.
Will be interesting to see If this Is like Got S1-4 or S5 and onward
Finalmente! È arrivata l'ora di lasciarci alle spalle quella merda immonda dell'ottava stagione di GOT e di iniziare un nuovo percorso e una nuova avventura...
Lfgggg
I hope this show also builds up multiple interesting plot points and then completely ignores them in the final season.
Mom I want geralt of rivia We have geralt of rivia at home Geralt of rivia at home 0:52
without the original theme music of GOT, it won't be so interesting 🙄
We need HBO Max India please 🙏
Let it be known that all that fancy Targaryen Dynasty falls in the face of the Drunken Robert who dies by a boar 🤣
Hands up!
I am only gonna watch this after the whole series is ended or cancelled
Im gonna be honest, Rings of Power is fked
2022 and we still have to watch pixelated trailers?
It looks stupid
Heyecanlandığım nadir yapıtlardan love you Dragos 😎
#JusticeForUncleBenjen
the background tune sounds amazing 1:00
🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Woke
“I will not be made to choose between my brother and my daughter” Knowing Game of Thrones I expected that the next phrase would be: “I will f*ck them both”
Winter is coming 🕴️
Caraxes looks so terrifying, I wish he was a bit bigger/leaner though, he seems a bit small in this trailer.
Holy crap, this looks woke af, I sure writing is going to be top notch.....right?
I need to show my mama. She loves this show.
Why do the comments read like bots?
Hopefully they don't mess up the ending of this too..
The ending scene is so cool, Vhagar beeing like:“Who goes here in my backyard.“
Looks good, just don't blackwash it! Enough moolignans in fantasy worlds.
If it is just half as good as game of thrones and a better end it will be better than any other tv series this year and years to come
Can't wait to see who plays Nettles
I got goosebumps, though after GoT I thought I'd never get them again. Damn it, HBO.
calling it now. there wont be a season 2
That one dragon looks so much like Smaug. I love it.
I really want to see faith militant uprising on the screen to.
The key question is, who wrote the screenplay? As we all know once they moved away from the book content, GOT was a disaster.
Not gonna watch a show made by racists unfortunately ^^
GOD GODDDDDD OMG OMGGGGG FINALLY POC CHARACTERSSSSSSSSS
You're still not forgiven for season 8 GOT.
Idk fam it just doesn’t seem interesting to me. I’m over the iron throne, I wanna know about the third eye raven, children of the forest, the night walkers origin. The show looks cool I just hope it goes into all the magic and mystery surrounding the world. Finally lay down some ground rules for tv show lore
HBO could remake seasons 7 and 8 of Game of Thrones but chose not to... oh well, I really hope this new one is really good.
❤
The soundtracks 🤤
GOOSEBUMPS !!! The internet and TV world is going to get crazy .
I am here because House Targaryen is my favorite house and absolutely love and adore dragons. Team Rhaynera ♥️
Aemond the kinslayer lookin sharp
**ENDLESS TRASH!**
DRAGONS ARE COMING !!!
A king has always an heir 🥱.....but who 😳
1:48 young Viserys and BALERION
The show looks good
4.7M views and only 104k likes YouTube really is dying
gotta be woke man
Ok, so Tekken 7 Leroy Smith is also a Tragariyan?
Please don’t try to recreate daenerys
Will we see balerion
I'm seeing a lot of spectacle. Let's hope all the other elements are treated with the same care.
Kill those dragons already,  Before you windup series because of vfx budget issues
Ok. GoT had black actors. But they played black roles, like literally people from the south. This sjw crap has blacks on white roles just for the sake of inclusivity. 0/10 already. Next
Wonder if we’ll see a you next and Robert
The whole Targaryen family is a result of incest, it's kinda scary
No. You had your chance and ruined it.
Ticking all the woke boxes. This may be even worse than LOTR: The Rings of Power.
Rhaenyra on the Black side and Aegon of the Greens, many dragons will be dropping fast in this show, can't wait to see my favorite characters during all this especially Daemon the Rouge prince
Aemond looks EXACTLY like All Blacks superstar fullback Damien McKenzie(Rugby)😂😂Funny thing is Dmac's actually light blonde haired
Of cause they wokeified it
I animated those :) 🙃
Hindi dabbed kab aayega
lol
after season 8 of GOT... no one cares about this crap anymore
I'm assuming we didn't see Balerion in this trailer but omg I am SO excited
🤸‍♂🏋‍♂🤸‍♂🏋‍♂🤸‍♂🏋‍♂🤸‍♂💥💢
I thought war was a hand!? Hahaha
Is Balerion dragon is this timeline?
I am cautiously optimistic. Will not watch it on day one, but definitely give it a chance if there are good reviews out there
Why not just make ALL the Targaryen's and even Aegon the conqueror himself black then? What does lore even matter anymore to these "creators" who recently admitted to race swapping just for muh diversity's sake?
Here come all the... "Looks like GoT before it went crap"... comments!! - And these same people will rip the crap out of this new series for sure, no matter how good it is!
HOTD will win ROP, its clear.
Can't wait 💔😩
I feel like this is some GOT fan made video 😅
An HBO??? It’s “A HBO” A E I O U !   These people are so incompetent it’s hilarious!
Caraxas 😋
This is Incredible wow..Daemon is Awesome Can't wait to watch it..this would be better than the Original..with more Dragons? Biblical
I'll give it a chance but I am so not hyped for this. The storytelling style feels different from GOT, the soundtrack seems...funky? And the costume designs are just so bad.
اتوقع بيصير اعظم مسلسل في تاريخ البشريه
i cant enjoy a show anymore. all i can see are political messages,thank you 2022
After a lot of waiting
Gay
Did someone say "dragons"? 👀🔥🐉
'When I am Queen I Will create a New order..' Thats literally Dany  Ooof  Rhaenyras is not Dany.
I’ll pass 😄
I am way more excited to again see the dragons on my screen than anything else. Because the most heartbreaking thing in GOT was the sheer stupidity that resulted in the conversion of Dragon Viserion  into Ice dragon and the utter nonsense that led to the death of dragon Rhaegal. If the creators were to kill them, they should have been given better plots resulting in their killing/ dying.
is that... venus in furs?
Yugg
I'm so happy
Imagine an RPG game as huge as Red Dead Redemption 2 based on this show.
That last dragon looks fkn lethal
Story feels a bit generic but looks awesome
I love this remix of the opening song so much, even though it's quite different it instantly reminded me of the Linkin Park remix in "War of the Sparks".
Yeah it's gonna be woke garbage because A. The Velaryons are from Valyria and are known for PALE skin and purple eyes and B. The creators just admitted this was more about diversity than the lore.
Where are the other 15 dragons?🥺
Jonsnow where 😞
It felt like took to long Cant wait anymore
2:20 Aemond Targaryen
Man I am so exited this is going to be so badass😈
House Of The Dragon is gonna be so epic!
Dank Farrik, this looks absolutely crazy!
who is gonna watch this after the failed series of got?
Man I really hope that woke culture doesn't destroy this show
Now this is how you do it amazon, take it as an example
That black guy looks so out of place that its cringe worthy.
Didnt hear The epic music of game of thrones?
อยากดูมาก อดใจรอไม่ไหวแล้ว
Do I have to read the book to understand the show or not?
%100 trash
And Where Are The Negroes Dragons?😂
I am excited to watch this first episode, however, the ONLY reason I’m going to invest any time in it at all is because via my research “Dumb and Dumber” have absolutely nothing to do with the series. They don’t make one dime from it.
Viserys: "I have decided to name a new heir." Daemon:...sorry what?
Wow, lots of people who think GoT cheated them out of their Disney ending, and now they'll get what they wanted. LOL.
Could have been decent but they ruined the original show so who cares about the Dragon queen
Rhaenerya and alicent on the table 🔥🔥🔥
I just want to see a lot of dragon action
Just please don't end the series in such a disappointing way  I am still not over it...
2021?
This is really magnificent, I like how they let us see the huge difference between vhagar and the other dragons ( vhagar's foot is bigger than caraxes's head  )
The one thing that I want the most out of this show is Cregan Stark- I need Cregan Stark, the true badass out of the whole of House Stark’s lmaoo
If this will be avalaible in hindi dubbing than trust me it can compete with the likes of vikings and the witcher
I think its going to be better than GOT.
Hindi dubbing we need
Diversity hires. I'm out.
why is there a trailer for the trailer before the trailer???
It is indeed morbin time once again
Boy, does this look good. If only they could somehow squeeze in the white walkers.
no lannisters no party
My body is ready. *strips*
War is not: A hand, an arm, a leg War is: A foot
It have to be release with hindi dubbing 😍😍
Half of the Targaryens went mad, during that history. You know what they say. Every time a Targaryen is born the gods flip a coin.
Awesome show it seems
Did anyone else notice the velvet underground in the backround?
are whites allowed anything? a black targaerenyn lol. they not learnt get woke go broke yet, looks like absolute shite
Das sollen Drachen sein? Das ist ja total langweilig, da meine Kreatur hier alles gezeigte ganz locker übertrifft. 🐣
Burn them all
My expectation getting more higher
Black Targarian with bold hair. Your efforts are so funny.
Let’s hope this show doesn’t become the Kenobi of the Game of thrones franchise
Why does this have 21k dislikes LOL
Oh my god!looks amazing
More woke trash
*🕉️ 🚩 🇮🇳 INDIA 🇮🇳 🚩 🕉️*
Meh 🥱
雰囲気がすばらしくて、ぜひ見てみたいです！
eagerly waitinng....
Негр Таргариен ????? У вас там кукуха поехала???????
Why got season 9 is not come out 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
Can't wait 😄
Look at how they made it a Feminioid type of story, with all Black characters, a Girl Boss is mad that they don't have Woman ascension in a Monarch, so she gains backing of the Black characters who are seen discriminated against and kill the "White Supremacist" characters to gain control of the throne.  the entire story is Jewish Talmud practice.
When GOT was drama series, it was good... When it become action series focused on CGI, it become Shietshow.... This Show is destined to flop...
I think Eve Best is gonna absolutely knock it out of the park as Rhaenys
The music sounds a bit like that from a fist full of dollars - not the theme tune, where two families were at war and neither won
Do I need to watch GOT to watch this? I know I'm crazy for not watching it during its run also I heard the final season was so bad it kinda put me off
This show adds a crazy vibe of dragon exhalation....
where are the white walkers?
Myree
the fire will reign
For the dragons alone, it’s worth it 💯👏🏾👏🏾
HBO trying to catch lightning in a bottle.
Garbage lol and the downvotes are blocked, look at how the entire cast is Black with dreadlocks and it all looks bizarre.
As long as they come up with an awesome opening + awesome accompanying score.
It looks amazing <3
Thank you
War is afoot.
I hope another got type...
Well designed dragons. And their skin/scale textures feel so real.
wow
Keep Dumb & Dumber (aka D&D) away from this series please. They ruined the last one.
I really hope this series is about great character development instead of pushing femcentric political ideologies down our throats. Once again a girl emerges out to beat all the bad evil men who were oppressing her. This get really old really fast. And as a man I am fed up with this idea. An advanced f*ck off to all the feminist bimbos who are righteously trying to reply to this.
looks boring af. Too many women in screen. Looking more like a telenovela than fantasy hahaha
Can't wait to watch this for 8 years and then be severely letdown
Time for your slop, piggies. Eat up.
Can't wait to see dragon again 😱😱😍
Hey remember how Dany was going to be the first queen of westeros....hmmmmmm I wonder what happens regardless does look badass
Im surprised no one comment "morbin time" with matt smith in this 💀
It looks really pretty, if they hired good writers to flesh out what GoT is about, it could be good. I'm cautiously optimistic.
Whoa, so much ✌️diversity✌️ and ✌️girl power✌️!!! 😍😍😍
If the story is like the last season or like the books, it's gonna be bad.  But at least the quality will be good, HBO knows how to film.
Is this based on the books?
This version of Venus in Furs as background music is 🔥
"Powerful brave and stunning "
Less darker screen would be better 😂
THEY'RE FINALLY HERE!
What the song on 0:50?
As long as Dan and Dave are far away from this I’m on board.
Here really good cast😍
Gotta say, this looks exceptional!
Hey!  When will you come to India HBO Max ? 😅
Man, I can't wait to pirate this.
I can not possibly imagine how this could give me the magical feeling the first seasons of Game of Thrones did before it collapsed, but i will gladly give this show a chance.
It comes out the same day as my birthday
Looks stuning
So we are starting with Dance of the dragons I see. It's gonna be  FIRRRREEEE................quite literally
I can't wait...but I liked Hindi virsion.
Yarr harr watching HBO shows for free :)
We want it's Hindi dubbed version
Don't worry guys; the dragons are on their way. They're almost here, but first....
GOT won my heart 🛡️💗 Now it's house of dragons turn 🔥 Waiting From India 🇮🇳❤️
Havnt we been here before? Literally Dany Lite 😂 the whole “woman can’t be on the throne” thing is played out from the GoT series I was hoping for more.
Valar Morghullis...
Love it!!!! Amazing 😍😍😍Much more nice then -LOTR from prime.
I'm going where I belong to ' WESTROS '
Looks actually stunning. But I'm smelling the same stuff with Danaerys (I get that it's in the books already) but it got boring real quick in Season 8, so I hope it doesn't fall into the same pitfalls again. Note: I've not read the books so don't know the story of how all this goes.
Wait let me get the resolution to the highest setting i dont want to miss Anything!!!!!!!!
Matt Smith 🔥❤️
Already obsessed with the BGM🔥🔥🔥
This is gonna put Woke of the Rings in its place
Which book is this based off from ? I wanna read it before the show starts airing  ?
Its going to be "a long road"
Drogo was really big compared to the dragons during this time.
Amaizng
Goosebumps , Road to the Iron Throne will always be interesting 😍
War war never changes.
Where is stark family i cant see them
Black Targarien is bad idea(
See cuz.....we wuz dragon kangz mane. We done been valayarionz mane

The cast looks so unattractive compared to GOT, at least pick a good looking cast
It feels like I just watchd the whole thing. :)
Wait. Was that Vhagar at 2:29? It looks like Vhagar cuz it had bright green eyes. And Oh My GOD Caraxes "The Blood Wyrm" really is angry and terrifying!
Where's the BGM broo....
keep to the books
This is more interesting than LOTR
I like how they made Caraxes actually look violent and bloodthirsty. It does seem like they are going to give the dragons different personality's too!
If the writing ain't there I don't care, and it doesn't look like it has it.
Really hope they do this right now ....
Where Is Hindi Trailer 🤦🏻🤦🏻
Looks okay
Is this necessary? Hopefully it's worth my time watching.
This is just the same story? again?
Give me dragons x dialogue and I’ll gladly give up these funds.
Eh. Looks okay.
Mallus c'mon
Looks incredible
Amazing
Leetttttssss gooo this is what we have needed for years!!!

Não consigo saber a descendência da Daenerys
2022 AND WE STILL HAVE 1080p TRAILERS....
The Blacks Vs. The Greens.
Let the dance (of the dragons) begin
Amazing
Негры-блондины, это нечто, которое не дожило до "Игры престолов". И это хорошо.
Nao quero criar expectativas, so nao vi muito dos dragões ate agora... E eu queria saber de uma coisa, a Daenerys é descente de quem nessa história?
I cannot forget how bad Season 8 was. Sorry.
oh my god is that Milo from Morbius????????
Just finished binge watching "The Crown"....all I see is Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh 😆😆🤣🤣
Idk are or a gate or gates a n d I just do no d o this so get o u t. Leave posers and criminals . Find some lord and Jill. Jill. And Grove so e I've having your stupid life. Meaning nothing lose. And lose and lose
How did alicent get so close to the rheanerya with a knife what was the her guards doing
F U HBO Im still waiting on season 8!
I'm not going to watch this until it's finished and I know if it ends like GoT...
In the 80s i saw a movie named neverending story. Today i have it every day 🐱
They've already clearly deviated from the source material. They've made the same mistake that doomed GOT before even releasing the thing. What a steaming pile of horseshit. Hope you showplebs are happy.
History will remember the injustice done to GOT season 8

I want to care but… we already know how the story of the Targaryens end, there’s no point so I’m just not interested despite how it looks and despite how dope the dragons look. Season 8 totally dropped the ball, I’m not a Daenerys fan in the slightest but if she had a different end then I’d absolutely be rushing to watch on release day :/
They better use the best CGI in the world with these dragons, because I am NOT watching this s*it for the plot
Let's GOOOOOO!!!!!!
The music at 0:56 absolutely blew me away. August 21st can’t come soon enough

Yes I love the dragons, but I also love me some Matt Smith
The Doctor is just doing whatever he wants at this point.
I dont know why this has so many dislikes. This show has new show runners, finished book and George backing them all the way. Can we actually give this a chance before automatically giving this a thumbs down.
I cant wait for this goosebumps all over me
🔥🔥 I Am YouTube 🔥 Mera Tech  Channel Ha' 🕵️👉Mera Channel Se Aapka Help
Is there going to be same level of nudity as of GoT ?

black Targarien with Afro braids, ahaha, so stupid cast
99% of comments on this video are bots 😂
Sunder dayanachakali
Leroy Smith looking dope.
it's looks like 💩💩💩food for soyjacks
I have yet to see Aegon Targeryen.
Next month
Lol comment section filled with bots programmed to praise different aspects of the show. Can you guys at least make it less obvious? Thanks
The princess better wear some armor if there are fight scenes with her.
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
perhaps i am missing something here but this prequel does not show the person that actually is on the iron throne from the end of the GOT series confusing
Just please dont hand this over to Directors D&D. Dumb and dumber
*WAAAH!  WHY DID SEASON 8 BE SO BAD???* 😪
Am waiting for this
Black or Green?
No asians or polynesians? Its rasism, you know. And put some indians with maya!
going back in 100%
How I wish HBO execs just admitted their fault and reshot GoT Seasons 7-8 again. I'm sure that the viewership would be skyrocketed for a proper series finale and any GoT spin-off would create much more interest. Because knowing all the story end awfully destroys GoT's rewatchibility and reduces the hype for anything new set in Westeros.
Just like the real world blacks, formerly enslaved,  are more emancipated than women
This looks great. Lets not judge this based on how the main show went. We should give this series a chance. Hyped about this!
Did they seriously put in a black guy with blond dreadlocks? LMFO
HBO : QUALITY LEAVEL OF SERIES 🔥🔥🔥
I know nothing about this (only that it's a prequel). Doctor with a white wig has attracted my attention. I may fancy rewatching seasons with the Eleventh.
Ramin Djawadi's background score is what all GoT fans requires. 🤞
Bgm💥💥💥💥💥
Vhagar is gigantic 🤩
the show ruined the whole mythology for me...reading the books and waiting for WoW...
incredible
Can’t wait! GOT was good hopefully this one matches it
It looks disgusting
Don’t count on it.
So are they going to make the hype for 7 seasons and make a fool out of audience again? OR this time they have a different plan?
Pls no reverse grips on swords
1 Month to go!
Wow I'm speechless. Dragons for ever! Long may they rule the skies :)
Oh no, what a horrible series this gonna be with woke actors. How they make it as good as the GameofThrones series
august 21 ??
Hard to be excited for another show from this IP, when the writers keep giving up in the middle of a project, just so they can move on to the next big thing.
Velaryon wigs still look like someone stole the floor mops of Groundskeeper Willie
please no more drinking starbucks coffee on the set
yawn. don't care.
chills. i literally got chills!!!!!!!!!! I'm so excited for this show
Make one more epic to ruin its ending
هل توجد مسيرات للتكفير
She is McQueen - prequel?
Seriously?velvet underground -  venus in furs remix??
The trailer alone was better than the final season of Game of Thrones.
IM SO EXCITED
I don't see x factor actors here like jon snow :/
Wooo super
Missing WHITE WALKERS😔
Blockbuster ❤️❤️
Would I need to watch GOT To get into this
August 21 , House of dragon and Ring of fire 2nd sep .. hollyshit 💕💕💕💕💕💕
Brace yourself, Winter is coming, again!!
wtf...an unwanted new female ruler wants to make a new order..uuuh..where did I see this? ...I am afraid that this show will be as bad as last 2 seasons of GoT.
Hindi dubbed chahiye
Hindi dubbed kyu ni karte
ГАААААААААВНООООО. Looks like a pretty 💩💩💩💩
Based on the plot, maybe this should've been titled the Game of Thrones
Meh, More Feminist BS. This looks like a typical Hollywood female empowerment story. Men are bad and oppressive and incompetent etc..
Imagine Buying the 500 Online Streaming Sub for only looking 1 Series xDDD Waiting 5-6 hrs longer and get it for free....
It looks alright but I think the cast should have included unfamiliar faces in the movie/tv industry like in Game of Thrones coz it will be kinda difficult to watch some of these characters without being reminded of some iconic roles they played.
Looks boring. I will rather watch Rings Of Power
^ and his whole street calmly ties and knots the targaryen flags in front of their houses 🔥
Got bored watching the trailer, same plot as every other series, same character look, same era, yawn! Same intro music come to think of it, yet journalist says fans are stunned by trailer! Did i miss something?🤔
I hope they won't spoil the series with feminism that was nonexistent in the medieval world.
I don’t watch got but I clicked cause the dragon and see freaking milo from morbius. Ya know what that means ITS MORBIN TIME
seems like a soap drama, and can't help but keep remembering how trash the last two seasons were and how this might be trash too.
No One seems to be Interested
Which timeline is this? Will we see Balerion?
The music is so good
Without dumb and dumber this will be epic!
With this show the Dragon era is coming back.
Dudeee that was vhagar in the end
Can't wait for the battle above the Gods eye!!!
Is it stream on Disney plus hotstar?
Im sry but this looks dumb af.🙄
I remember Daenerys telling that the Dance of Dragons is the beginning of the end of their Targaryen family. This House of Dragons series is the perfect prequel of the game of thrones because it perfectly shows how fire and blood can throw an empire.
Sunfyre... is that u peeping in at the end ..? lol)
Velaryons🙊
Searching for true love ♾️
Look at Matt smith pulling out the tardis to win the war
i smell ... . . . . . . . . . WOKE
Пусть война будет лишь в сериалах и фильмах и желательно вымышленных.
GOT ending was so awful I have no interest in this show anymore, it looks epic but we all already know what happens in the end :(
Finally something that isn't woke garbage
I hope I see people getting their guts ripped apart
i am looking forward to just FullHD and stereo from HBO original production... Such a shame it wont be in 4k will dolby atmos.
Ramin Djawadi never disappoints🤩
omg I'm so hyped for this one. I have goosebumps and I'm so emotional now. GOT meant so much to me.
Seeing the Iron Throne makes me excited already.  Can't wait 😍
Трейлер новой "Игры Престолов": Во всем мире; -Ух ты,классные драконы надо посмотреть Россия: -Почему так много НЕГРОВ!!!
Gad, I just hope the duo that did the original isn't involved in this one.
fascinating out of the world I love it.
Nice new Trailer for The Lord of the Rings... i thougt Amazon made it?! Ohhhhhhh...
"When i am queen , I will create a new order" Yes Rhaenyra break the wheel!
Tbh i was hoping for more grainy and naturalistic cinematography that is more reminiscent of the first few seasons of GOT with a bit more color. Not a fan of this drap, grey/brown color grading. 🙁
"Evil is not able to create anything new, it can only distort and destroy what has been invented or made by the forces of good.” JRR Tolkien
Do people have alzheimers? This IP is destroyed forever.
So excited for this one!
Resemblance Resemblance Resemblance, GOT, GOT, GOT.
Прогнулись под повесточку.. Печально..
If you guys read the book, you'll understand how epic this would be.
OMFG!! Since I read Fire and Blood,  my favorite part of the lore always been the dance of the dragons. I dreamed it a lot. I am super excited about this series and the trailer definitely shows that we will watch a very good one.
Idk but if I have to choose, this looks  better than LOTR and the music is fire 🔥
Do I need to watch game of thrones to watch this?
I would love to see king Robert crush the Targaryen dynasty.
(In theory) Lady Melisandre could be part of this.  Am I wrong ?
It'll be the greatest series in history besides GOT 👌🏻.
Still mad on how you raped the original series.
I'm just hoping this will actually be good
Always have to add a token black character even tho it doesn't follow the books or make historical sense for diversity sake right?
Wow! I'm  sold on the trailer.
Love Rhys Ifans.  Paddy Considine is solid as well, but my god did they butcher the final season of GOT.  Don't expect I'll be a first day watcher of this series.  Probably wait until season one concludes if it's worth how drawn out and slow I expect it to be...
Never watched Game of Thrones. Might have to watch ur and hopefully this will be lit by when I finish
Black Targaryens, very realistic. For the sake of a stupid trend to spoil a great series
Will there be Starbucks cups?
Boring.
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Whelp, time to rewatch game of thrones for the 100 millionth time, while I wait for this 😂
this trailer sucks
So excited for this
this is going to be awesome cant wait :)
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Worst cast you could imagine.
Anyone else excited for the soundtrack?? Also thinking if I should challenge myself and read the book before the show comes out .
Morbin time!
Ramin Djawadi you absolute beauty
Idk man not getting the vibes yet but sure it will be great
#TEAMBLACK 🖤🔥
Bow to the greatest show ever 👌
Guaranteed to be woke
I'm not sure they mentioned the Iron Throne enough... ;) No, seriously, looks great, I'm curious
Finally.
really sad they ruined the series. this trailer had so much potential but was just a farce.
0 hype. After got disaster only a fool fall to same trap twice!
"When I'm Queen, I'm going to create a new order."

I hope this is good and not another copy for got
I heard the Starks will be bad guys in this one. Should be interesting.
This looks WAY better than the Rings of Power
Wondering if this will be another GOT series that will introduce fantastic creatures only to wind up doing f* all with them.
It looks great. We could see Dragonstone, the future Iron throne and the complete arena too. It is good how they connected this prequel-spinoff to the original show.
I mean I'm hyped and will watch but I just can't possibly imagine this story being told better than it was in the book Fire and Blood. Also who tf was the black guy with the dreadlocks supposed to be? I do not remember him
It seems the Targaryens kind of forgot how to hatch dragon eggs 😓
I hope they’re not focusing too much on delivering a woke message in the middle of a medieval drama. Other than that, it looks amazing.
Which House do the Black people belong to?
This is going to be woke BS I can already feel it. Gaes and muh whaman power.
Nise move my channel g tanda5664
Wow.
Please hindi dubbed in India
Gosh  I’m just hoping to see some dragon-on-dragon crime  Let’s see some actual dragon combat this time!
Does every targaryan fire proof like daenerys in this show?
Ohhhh god that bgm🥵❤️
Kinda sus how the all the comments are in unanimous support. Maybe fix Game of Thrones before making a new show?
Very much yes.
I bet this will shows something big that we didn't seen in GOT
I'm still unhappy about how they wrapped up last season. They'll definitely find a way to ruin this one or make it cringe
Daemon is giving me Ivar the Boneless vibes let's go.
After watching the last season, the way it ended, now there's nothing in GOT that excites me
Drinking game: Take a shot every time somebody says "Iron Throne"
Bot positive comments lol
I guess they gave up on the whole targaryens being attractive thing
House of woke dragons
Okay people, remember what we've learned. As long as this show doesn't have an ending we should be good.
Wasn't this cancelled?
I think the thing I'm most interested in seeing in this show is how they portray Dalton Greyjoy. The Greyjoys and the Ironborn as a whole kinda got sidelined in Game of Thrones, so hopefully they remedy that with this show.
I'm so excited, as in, I know I did NOT enjoy the last season of GOT, but still...anything by GRRMartin..I want to see on screen. I can't wait for the show.
dead on arrival.
реально выглядит только дракон. что бабы, что мужики — все накрашенные, наглаженные как с обложки журнала. ну не выглядят они как люди тех времен. короче, игру престолов никто не повторит и лучше не сделает
I'm impressed not a Starbuck coffee cup or water bottle in sight. They've really upped their game.
The background score looks on point.seems like a good show
I wonder how they'll play off the scene where the Lord's of Westeros decide which side they will side with before the Civil War begins. No Starks but I hope Roderick Dustin also known as Roddy the Ruin gets the hype he deserves when he rides south with the Winter Wolves.
I hope the ending is good
Meh. Pass.
When GRR said “I'm excited. It's always a little apprehensive when you turn your baby over foster parents, but I'm involved in this” he weren’t kidding 🔥
do we have white walkers ?
I'm kinda ambivalent overall, but I'm pumped to see Paddy Considine in something like this.
For God so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have ever lasting life. John 3:16  Jesus on the cross for your sins and rose again on the third day from the tomb. He loves&cares about you&has a plan for your life. If you put your trust in Jesus you will have eternal life. He is a healer and can help you in life. ❤️😊
❤️🍑
madly missing night walkers
isnt it crazy how in the begining otto higtower was advocating rhaenyra and corlys velaryon oposed her? oh, how tables have turned
but why they were in hurry to end the original GOT
This looks like derivative trash distantly regurgitated from source material. Hope I'm wrong.
This looks so good🔥😻
🔥🔥🔥
Obviously they've huge amounts dough on this but it still lacks the atmospheric allure and captivation of Game of Thrones.
Ooooh am super excited to watch this🤩🤩🤩
lets goooo
Beautiful 😍
I wish it should be dubbed in hindi
man oh man!!!
So.. any males in this series? Lol
Imagine we get to see an ancestor of Little Finger and he also made all of these houses fight each other.
Was that King Robert charging in with his mighty warhammer?!
I LOVE IT!!! THIS IS GONNA BE SOOOOOO EPICCC 🐲🐲🐲🔥🔥🔥🔥
No Red woman?, no night walkers ? well GOT plain drama version...hey it's not goddam review! you go watch it 😃
Who else is missing the GOT theme soundtrack
Season 3 of The Witcher looks great
Looks interesting but i Hope the last two seasons will be better.
The soundtrack is fire
Putting olives on your nipples and dancing to Machine Gun Kelly does not make you cool.
This is a month aug ❤️✌️
Hope after watching this ,we come from  GOT season 8 trauma.
The black characters make no sense at all . It’s more breaking and a HBO add on . No issue with diverse character but this makes no sense lore wise .
I am very exited but i hope that it will not cause the disappointments like the previous caused :)
Will we get to see the actual Rains of Castamere??
Ugh. Another crusade against "the patriarcy". Excuse me for rolling my eyes.
Spoiler main woman of the show will be eaten by her half brother's dragon
I haven't been paying a lot of attention to this series but are they adapting Dance of Dragons?
What's really important kids, is not the character development or the story, or the immersion of the audience, or staying true to the source material. Are women and people of color getting their fair share of screen time? That's what's really important.
Hbo did it again. Another big hit on their hands!!
If looks great! Let us pray they nail the end this time.
Lol is it going to be season 8 all over again??
Nonton ulang Game of Thrones sebelum nonton ini 😁
Yeahhhhh... think I'll wait for reviews this time.
The soundtrack at 0:55 reminds me of "Venus in furs" from The Velvet Underground. Listen closely!
Hello! Everyone from Russia ❤️🇷🇺❤️ is there are white Walkers in this series Like Series GOT ?? Coz I would love to see them again 😢
I don't play games when it comes to my children and this is LindaKaeMaynor
copy of game of thrones
It all ends with Season 8
Eh thats aemond with the eye latch right...but why he kinda look like daemon thou
Meh...I'm skeptic...
Goodbye DnD
Yeah let's throw a black in for no reason at all
When You Play The Game Of Thrones, You Win Or You Die. 🔥🔥
Years ago, I would have been so excited for this but now, I really just don't care.
It looks amazing! Cant wait :)
Hi friends
What, no black dwarves?
This looks epic I won't lie.. i am really excited now..
Goosebumps came  while watching the dragon
Dance of Dragons is one of the best stories from George R Martin
All imma say is don’t fvck it up, like Amazon is doing to LOTR lol…just tell a good story.
The Velvet Underground - Venus In Furs   Is the sample
It is from game of thrones?
Can't wait till they rush and ruin the ending
The dragons in The house of the dragon are very ugly
Even though the trailer is good, I dont i have the urge to see it or could not care less if this gets cancelled
0 hype. After got disaster only a fool fall to same trap twice!
🥵
Now they see you as you are🔥
HBO series are always a levels of quality above other streaming services.  This looks amazing.
Who else is excited to see bêlerion the dread
"Dreams didn't make us kings, my mom did" - Joffrey
yassssss the dragon is wearing armor. thank you lord for this sight
Hey guys when I should watch it on HBO tv channel Can I have the premier time
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I look forward to excessive Starbucks product placement.
Говна - пирога, но всяко лучше ведьмака
Pass. Have fun kiddies
Please don't tell me that black dude with white dreds is also targaryen, just because he has white dreds
okay im hyped
Im i the only one that hears venus in furs btw looks amazing
Marvel got a lot of catching up to do.
Dragons 😍
Morbius brother
Excited 😍😍😍😇😇😇👏👏👏💞💞....🔥🔥🔥💥💥💥 Thank you makers ❤️🙏🙏🙏
The show is gonna be so good
Black Velaryons 🤣
Plz release it in hindi too👍🔥🔥
The ending...was that Vhagar? <3
I’m very excited ten years ago.
ehh
Is this an era of Balerion? I haven't read the book
I just pray it's good lol
Saludos desde GUATEMALA 🔥🔥🔥👌🏻
Considering that the music is the main riff from Velvet Underground's "Venus in Furs" I guess we can look forward to lots of whipping in this show.
Wait... Is nobody thrown way off and taken out of Westeros by that very out of place dude as royalty in kings landing? This is crazy, 10 years ago they wouldn't have cast him!  I guess I gotta say it... Valerians are not race mixers...   How are freaking Galifreyans at court? WE WUZ TIME LORDS and shiiieeeett.
So happy to see so many diversity hires! They are listening guys. They will continue to sacrifice plots and lore to spread “the message”. Yay for authentic realism of the source material. /s
🔥 Dracarys 🔥
Greens 💚🐲
After all these years they still are calling what is a Wyvern a Dragon.
alright HBO you get 1 more chance
The Brand image always on top, and always Hugh n high revolution world class business in OTT platform. Love you from India 🇮🇳😎👍🤩
This show is dead
They better not wreck it
I hope the writing is as great as GoT seasons 1-5
HBO Minimum!!!!!
The trailer doesn't give off the same vibes as the Game of Thrones series, definitely more dramatic and fast paced in line with more modern shows... but hopefully that's a good thing!
Black guy with blonde dreads ? Aren't these guys like inbred whites ?
please hbo, ¿why don't you remake or rewrite the last season of game of throne? It is what we need, and what the series deserves, a good ending, and not the rushed and finished in such an outrageous way as the one they delivered.
here we go again !
Y'all had me until y'all black washed that family for no reason
This series will definitely win a big reward, unfortunately will be for the ugliest actors ever played in a tv series. I loved GOT, and the main reason for that was the actors, here is not the case.
I'm just glad Dumb and Dumber are not involved in this one
All this for what?! For one lousy stark to sit on the throne.
they betrayed us, won't trust them anymore.
Amazon’s Rings of Power does not have bigger canvas like this series has. Hope this series deceivers on all expectations.
Please release in Hindi language..
I guess it looks cool, but the fact that you know that a targyeryn will seat at the throne no matter what kinda takes the Fun And the "game of thrones"aspect of the show
I wasn't really interested before but now I want to watch it, the crew did a great job
I hope those two idiot writers from GoT are not writing this.
I wish there would be more intimate scenes 😇😇
Epic 🔥🔥🔥!!!!!!
Anyone know which dragon is at 2:31
This show will swallow rings of power.
Très bonne bande annonce ! L'intrigue est évidente et intéressante ! Ça donne le goût de relire le livre !!! Comment Viserys pilotera-t-il cette impasse ??? Mouwhahhahahahahaha : )
Milly!
عظمه 🌚❤️❤️
I’m ready to have my heart broken again.
Let me guess… we’ll see a bunch of Lesbians being independent women
Would be awesome if they did this for every major house...House of the dragons for the targaryens, house of the lions for the lannisters and house Rayne, house of the wolf for the starks, house of  thorns for the tyrells, house of the bear for the Mormonts, house of sand for the martells...
Isso vai ser muito loco pqp
Doesnt look that good. Better to be sceptic and amazed than hyped and disappointee
🐉🐉❣️❣️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Any white walkers and a Night King?
No thanks
മലയാളികൾ ആരും ഇല്ലേ
please release in Hindi language India
🤨 this better not be dead on arrival...
no, thank you.
Nobody cares about GoT anymore thanks to the last couple of seasons. We all saw what you guys can do when you don't have a solid story to base your screenplay on.
I want to watch the last episode before I commit myself to watching this. I don't have trust in this anymore 😂
Unnecessary
Looks good but I'll just wait until all of the episodes are released and the reviews are in. After GOT S8 I'm not taking any chances
Oink.
Aemon one eye mysterious af
This looks phenomenal!!!!!!!
Just Amazing!!!
Knives will come out ⚔️ so is fire 🔥
can’t stop watching ittt
🔥
Love it
I hope this season they will explain where the dragon takes its rider after death...
So it is Game of Thrones with modern day feminism littered throughout it. How original.
I want to see the Battle above the Gods Eye so bad!
Wonder if they hired competent writers this time...
Hindi dub
Every dragon scene from season 1 is in this trailer, I pressume
House of the Dragon is like that ex who tore your heart out when they broke up with you then messages “Hey :)” three years later like nothing happened.
Plz dubbed in telugu
한국에서는 못보는건가
Ok, is there the Balerion The Black Dread?
Let see how this will make people love it and in turn fail the fans...
GP Muthu sarpaga padam vetri adaiya vazhthukkal 😂💯
World of bes season
stay true to the story, and don't make things woke for the sake of woke and this serious should be good
please tell me those two idiots are not directing this.
"How many Iron thrones?" "Yes"
lol after the endind of the OG game of thrones im totally not interested in this show at all...
The whole "woman challenging status quo" angle was already explored with Danny's rise among dothraki to her sitting on the throne.. it was a sub plot among many previously and now it seems like it's the main plot of the season.. it just puts me off so much.. Please don't lecture me and tell me a good story.. that's all I ask..
Just hope that it would have the same clever dialogues, character developments, and plot as it’s predecessor, A Song of Ice and Fire.
GoT seasons 7 and 8 really gave me trust issues.  But like a moth to Bolton torture chamber, I'll probably get suckered in again.
Don't know how the audience are going to react to the show but noone would hate the music for sure...
The hype for baby monk in the 1 second part he was in :)
Imagine  investing so many hours watching  a show  for the  end to ruin everything.
This looks DAMN good.
I still wish they went even further back to the see the rise of the Targaryens. Maybe even starting the show in Valyria in its former glory, just before it fell, and then fast forward to Aegon's time. Then maybe the next season or two could be another fast foward to HOTD.
I didn't know Milo was in here, guess morbius will be showing up
We have seen petty kings and lords enough . It's time to see the real dynasty .  .hope they don't ruin it like  GOT .
I was hoping to hear drekars in this trailer
will it be 8 seasons?
Fire will reign 🔥🔥🔥
This looks absolutely gorgeous. But I'm having a hard time caring. After the last season of the show we all know how it ends so what's the point of all this? Dragons basically go extinct again and all the characters we liked died or get exiled. I'll give it a shot though because like I said... beautiful looking and the premise is good. That ending just poisoned anything Game of Thrones for me.
Why giving Witchers Vibe 😂🤣
HOUSE OF FUCKn WYVERNS!!! know the difference
Hindi Dubbing??
Daemon and his dragon looks badass asf
Oh god another one that will end disappointment
In what series will we see THE BALERION!!!? 😭 Don't say I need to wait another 10 years for another prequel to show him 😢
After got last season I don't want to mess up with another🤦
Sad we're not gonna get to see Balerion tho
dragons = like
Not gonna lie. Looks pretty cool.
yeahhhh
Негр с белыми волосами .ахахахахахвхахахахахахвхахахахахахахахахахахаххахахахахахахахахахахаххахахахахахахахахахахах
Yawn ! More like Game of thrones season 7 and 8 vibes then first few seasons
Im still not over what they did with game of thrones...
This is not life full like it use to be
00:56  , 1:33  trailer at it's peaks ❤️
Ok so the VFX budget is great 👍 I hope the story is as good as GoT...
My YouTube channel hae मेरा यूट्यूब चैनल है🔥🔥 My Tage Channel hae 🔥🔥 मेरा टेग चैनल है🔥 My Channel Se Aapki Halep Hoo Sektee He 🔥🔥 मेरा चैनल से आपकी हेल्प हो सकती है 🔥🔥
2:23 Please correct me if I'm wrong, but is that Dragon armour!? Ahhh I am so gassed for this!
I hope that they make the war great. They have a great cause for war, recognizable houses and names, and dragons. It’s hard to find better foundations for a show
Ah, here we go again....
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 Awwwww ........
Goosebumps
1.47  balerion in the house
Takip eden bir Türk benim herhalde
Holy smokes
I could hear jenny of oldstones.
❤️❤️❤️
They should do a sequal showing the genocide 🤷‍♂️
I'm die thank your forever
Still really hoping they give the dragons the same colour fire as their scales!!!!
I don't want a prequel. I want the ninth season.
This isn’t written by the dumbasses responsible for the last few got seasons is it?
i have very low expectations.
1:47 is that Balerion??? That dragon is huuge
OH MY LORD I AM EXCITED
Not diverse enough unfortunately
Gaaaay
Never going to watch jrr T show ever again. It's a waste of time. No closure.
Rhaenyra Targaryen: When I am a queen. I will create a new order.  Daenerys Targaryen: I'm not going to stop the wheel, I'm going to break the wheel.  ❤️
IPS glow sucks..
The trailer looks lit
Not so impressed by casting 👎 Hope it doesn't have ending like GOT  Disappointing
where is Aegon the ii??
I think 1:25 sets the tone for this shoyt.
Why this trailer got 18k *DISLIKES* ??  I Mean the trailer is decent,looks great.
after how bad GOT ended I feel like I shouldn't get invested, but I know I will
House of Dragon is what a good fantasy series should be, unlike certain other project from Amazon...
So So So EXITED 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The soundtrack!! f*ckng love it ♥️🔥
Got vs Lotr......... 🤪 Result will came in favor of audience ....
Looks better than The Rings of Power.
why so many dislikes?
Loved season 8, can't wait for this Spin Off 😍
I remember, once Shireen, the daughter of Stannis Baratheon mentioning "The Dance of Dragons" from the books to her father and Sir Davos. I guess that should be it and great fight between Brothers and Their dragons 🐲🐉
Nice 👍
I want different dragons with different colours like in the book that  breath fire with same colour such as their scales
Please don't let this be another woke hijacking of a good show.
CHILLS.
Wow, What a nice addition! I was sad to see GOT end at Season 7!
rhys - berlin station (epix) cancelled way too soon.
Most excited to watch this😍
Venus in Furs sounds so epic!!
song name?
Just my opinion: I don’t find Matt Smith a fitting cast choice. He tries to hard to appear intimidating, and instead it comes off like a pouting cartoon character. Did not like his acting in Last Night in Soho either. Same criticism from that venture.
I’m gunna wait till this show is over to watch. Not dealing with the cliffhangers
Hindi hindi hindi hindi dubb??????? INDIA 130CR+
HAIL TO THE KING!
Hope that anybody who was involved in GOT's last season has nothing to do with this.
GRRM going to procrastinate WoW for another decade
Gross. Will fail.
*Give us more Succession!
Can't wait
Will they also make a different series for the Stark family? The House of Winterfell?
This is gonna be epic. Fingers crossed!
Tough look for the black actors with these really fake looking white wigs lol
... this looks awful
Are we going to see the biggest dragon in all Westeros?
So... Kinda like House of Gucci
please be epic
Not as good as Original GoT. This will be boring.
😍😘
Looks far better than The Lord of the Blacks...
i just fell in love with Daemon & Caraxes, and shot of Alicent and Rhaneyra (Blacks vs Greens) was perfect.
Why are fish easy to weigh?      Because they have their own scales.
Its just not a TV series... Its beginning a new  Era🌠🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
สมัคร HBO รอเลย
Release in Hindi too...
very disappointment
The show seems promising .
I like how their showing more of the Targaryen’s history but overall after the disaster that is season 8 I don’t think it’s gon’ be good
am i the only one who feels like the dragons look a little cartoonish?😩
Can't wait!
This soundtrack sounds awesome
Somewhere Dumb and Dumber are crying into an empty bag of money because they just got shitted on by actual writing, directing and acting
2:23 is this vhagar or caraxes? 2:30 this is definitely syrax
I am excited for the dragons :D
I hope they stay true to the actual sizes of Vhagar and Vermithor in the books.
2:20 Is that Aemond Targaryen/Aemond One-Eye?
Means nothing in the end and they race swapped characters. Yuck
Can't wait to see it. 🤯
mixed feeling due to season 8 but i hope this is a great show
Money Vasul 💸🤙🔥
No thanks forever
Boom 🤙
The white dreadlock wigs look truly terrible, other than that I'll be interested to hear what people say about it
1.47 CARAXES 🔥🐉🐲
I like how they show us dragon footages because they know we like dragons.
Caraxan in the thumbnail be like: hehehehhehe
Did they make Daemon the antagonist to Rhaenyra instead of Aegon? I’m confused
Watching the trailer fr 10th time. The music gives another goosebumps
It’s amazing how much better this looks than Rings of Power.
The ending scene with the vhagar was just 🔥🔥
Hey, its that girl from ready player one
Endless
I like how the trailer is completely misleading the audience, unless, you know the story! Absolutely brilliant.
Where is Emilia Clarke?
Game of Thrones meets Succession and you have House of Dragon
*🔥 🔥 Can't wait for this insane prequel of the Masterpiece Game of thrones* 💥 days to go 🔥 #hotd
Woke garbage
Nice video ❤️❤️
NOW THEY SEE YOU AS YOU ARE
Where will house of dragon stream in India
I missed the word"winter is coming "
Waiting
Fire and blood!!!
Can’t wait!
HBO Max India launch kab hoga
The final 3 seasons of GoT were horrendously bad, I'm starting out with very little faith in HBO on this one
Hindi Dubbed
So different; not a single sword was drawn in GoT season 1 trailer.
Finalmente 😀🥳🥳🥳
More woke trash.
This will not become a great show like GOT, because  GOT was not just about dragons and one family. From trailer it's looks like nothing is that great about this series. GOT was always people relationships. At the end dragons were also lost.
I like dragons
wats the plot? when does this take place ? If anyone knows
Why is the audio so bad 😔
Shandaar 🔥🔥🔥
It's going to be legendary . 👀
#Forthethrone
Every time a Targaryen is born, the Gods flip a coin. ...
House of the Dragon Not content with the damage at the end of the series, they are going to destroy it with progre ideology. The Targaryen house are no longer blondes but blacks and those who rule are women, feminism to the fullest. ¡¡¡¡ Tired of so much garbage woke up !!!!
Where is a Stark🙄
Politics, dragon, social commentary, DRAGONS!!!
My one greatest wish... Please do not be like GOT season 7 and 8. T_T
I thought they cancelled this. 🤡🤡🤡🤣
1:30 oh great. a targaryen woman talking about changing the world order. I woooonder how this will end >_>
I'm just here to leave a dislike.
FIRE and BLOOD YES!
Is this as grimdark are Game Of Thrones? I’d rather it not be and be much more hopeful.
ياخي اه
Dreams didn't make us king *Dragons Did 🔥🔥*
The vibes are right. Big shoes to fill and a lot of disappointment to undo. Fingers crossed
Not going to compare this with GOT and their actors performance with this.. I'll go empty head to watch this show
*Rhaenyra Targaryen: "I will create a new order"* *Daenerys Targaryen: "I will break the wheel"* 🔥🐲🩸
😎👏👏
Hmmmm...no hot white haired girl????  Who is willing to stripe???
Show must be dubed in hindi
August 21, I'm coming to u friend🙂 finally. Let's fix that weak image of the last season in GOT.
I'll choose telegram
Witness the rise of the Targaryens! 🐉
Nope
Before this trailer* Some fans:im not gonna watch this!!this probably end like season 8!! After watching this trailer* That some fans:omg!!im so hyped up.cant wait to watch it!!
Only reason I got HBO Subscription :)
VHAGAR IN THE FLESH!!!!
after the last 2 seasons of GoT I won't even watch this when it comes out; I'll await reviews down the line
Still wish we were getting the long night show to explain the white walkers and all the age of heroes stuff would be cool
Another female dominance fantasy I see.
1:02 the Greyjoys are stubborn. How many times do they revolt and lost to Iron throne, exactly?
I have friends who really thought the new Lord of the Rings show was gonna be better than this. Ha ha ha. I laugh at them and their stupidity. Seeing this trailer is enough for me to say that this is going to be a better show than Lord of the Rings and perhaps one of the greatest shows of all time. I hope you can agree with me.
I'd be more excited if GOT wasn't butchered.
This has more dark fantasy feel to it. More ancient.
Let’s goooooooo!!!! 🔥 🩸 🐉
I’ll give er a go.
The book this story was based on was written from the point of view of biased maesters. George wrote the book & pointed that out even in GOT books - winning & biased side decides what will be written as history. He's also involved in this show & approves of showrunners' & writers' work, said he's seen 9/10 episodes & is happy with them. So because in Fire & Blood the history of this event was written by maesters who have been plotting Targ's downfall for a while, in this show we'll get to see what actually happened during this period.   Commented with this elsewhere, but here's some info for those that wonder if the show will follow any source material & whether George R. R. Martin is involved or not
My eyes filled with tears after long back . Tq for everything ❤️
Stunning and Brave 👏👏👏👏
Already plagued with race and gender politics.  No thanks.
This is going to make me play Skyrim again isn't.    "Hey you, you're finally awake."
🔥🔥
Is this going to be more like season 1 or season 8?
Cool
All this to sit on what i see is a very uncomfortable chair
Oh great more woke "yass queen" stuff.
Black Targaryens🤣
Please dubbed  Tamil and Telugu  language
Man I don't think everyone knows how depressing this storyline is going to be 🥲.
Please do justice to this . Dont throw away the plot like in GOT .Wish you ended GOT in a better manner.
Very difficult to get invested in this considering we know it just ends with the awful later seasons of the original series. It just looks like more plotting and fighting without much real substance behind it.
A whole new series and GRRM the lazy lard still can't get a book out.
Editor: How many times do u want "iron throne" to be repeated in the trailer Director: Yes
I like how there is more colour in this show, especially in the costumes, the Middle Ages were full of colour yet in media it’s always shown as dark and dreary.
Anyone else get turned on from this trailer don’t tell me that one looks like the girt from euphoria 🤣
I have an important question, who are the show runners?
Bgm🔥🔥
is this dance of the dragons era?
I wonder if this series will have as much child murder as there is in the lore
My goodness
If Balerion shows up,i will scream so loud!!
Nombre no manches qué cosa tan hermosa ya quiero verla
War... war never changes.
Betcha this has a bunch of woke propaganda in it.
game of thrones: succession
The ‘message’ is strong in this one!! “Women can be (KING) too” haha what a joke. It’s gonna be a giant flop, same as that lord of the rings crap…… please just for the love of god. Stop with these sublime messages! Just let me enjoy a show, without being bothered by all the politics..
While the acting looks like it may not be up to par with GOT, I'll be looking forward to this. For me, if it weren't for the little dragons perched on the shoulder of the Queen, I would have quit GOT after season 1.
Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
I’m so glad Ramin D. Is composing the music again!!! He did amazing in GOT
Is that going to be about the „struggles“ of a woman becoming queen? Cause if it is then it’s going to be trash. I don’t need feminist crap in there. I need a good story and I don’t see mich of that in this Trailer…
Why is a targaryan black? Is that lore accurate? Hope we get the magic of the first 4 seasons back
How we can watch in India
I already have a feeling Prince Daemon’s going to be one of my favourite characters. He is loved and adored by the people after all
I hate Hollywood. They ruin everything with their woke bs social engineering.
Their armor looks way cooler than Ever exist in GOT  .  I wish this series have More Mages
"A woman would not inherit the Iron Throne - Because that is the order of things" "When I am queen, I will create a new order" DAAAMNNNN the new Danny has come!
What i liked about GOT was Dragons and I think if there is more Dragons in this show than will definitely watch it 😉
My God.....everything is epic , especially music.
Zero relevance of the dragons
Haven’t read any of the books so I’m guessing no old characters will be on this show ?
Love alicent actress
Oh there's a lot of strong and independent wahmen in this show. This will be amazing just like GOT final season
Looks 1000x better than the trash Amazon is producing with WoT and Rings
😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
i smell shite
Faints
GØT IS BACK🥵❤️
OH POR DIOS!!! Esta increible, pero no pude evitar tener algunos deja vu con Drogon. Pero Wao WAO WAOOOO. No hace falta mas pelear sobre el Rey de la serie de este año. LOS DRAGONES FUNDIRÁN A LOS ANILLOS.
Gonna sit out at least 3 seasons to make sure this ends well.
We are seeing the dance of dragons storyline. That would epic. I would also like to see Aegon's conquest too in the series.
am i the only one felt that the heads of GOT dragons are more beautiful and scarier than this, it's that they are made of scales and dragon bones ,not from grandmother skin.
The music sounds good
So we go from a series where woman are complete badasses to a world where women are held back?  weird. woke. pass.
Looks very good, but after the GOT final season I’m keeping my expectations lower than the floor.
Nice blackwashing george, you really held strong against the DiVeRsItY rush.
will the night king and the white walkers be in this?
Dragonflight
That's why i love hollywood
if this show has GOT opening score, I'm gonna cry
this is an absolutely terrible trailer. The first one was sick and mysterious. This one is basically the story. So disappointing
Do I have to watch GOT to enjoy this show?
Is it me or can you see the Pixels
😌💥🗡
I hate that it will have this effect on me, but when Ramin plays Dany’s theme over the sisters doing something awesome, I know I’m gonna cry
Meh...
It better be good u GOT losers. This is your redemption!!!!
YO just make NEW content, NEW stories. GoT is over. Stop recycling and forcing old media onto people. It's annoying, it's the same thing all the time. Sick of it.
Fire will reign ♥
I see this, and no matter how awesome it looks—even if all the women win and all is well—every frame, all I can think of is “They killed Daenerys. They killed Daenerys. First, they assassinated her character, threw away all that she is; they killed Missandei, a former slave and her best friend, off in chains; and then, they killed Daenerys.”  We know what happens to her house, and a lot of the backstory is gross anyway. I don’t know that I care and wasn’t even sure I was gonna watch.   Then George RRRRR Martin just Had to compare it to WandaVision.  Will it actually be different, or inventive, like WandaVision? Probably not. Will it be as good as WandaVision? F# no. But now I’m gonna have to watch it anyway 🙄🙄🙄
Damn The Witcher S3 looks great
Looks like another feminist show... too bad
I'm tired of black people being shoved into European fantasy shows. Can we get some African fantasy shows please?
i just dislike matt smith
Aemond one eye lesgooooo
Why didnt they save it for SDCC?
the costumes are looking not as good as got...
Okay I'm sold!
Whoever wrote the soundtrack for this trailer has completely ripped off The Velvet Underground's, 'Venus and Furs'.
Idk weak trailer in my opinion not hype at all
Was that supposed to be aemond one eye at end?
Finally kings & queens arrived 🥵  GOT x HOD
Looks better than LOTR show
Ugggggghhhhh
A black man with white hair... Well.. It is so... It is very... An american style. Brain free.. Hey, HBO, is that dragon gay? NOOOOO??????!!!!! How could you?!! You infringe gays's rights! Quick quck fix that infringement!
Too much excited for this
i hope they include a forgoten lore here that can connect on new season
Still won't make up for Season 8.
Oh yes she is the ancestor(rheneyra) of khaleesi
Nothing interesting, looks like a regular soap opera drama, just with dragons. Where is the red band trailer? No blood, no swearing, nothing mature in this trailer.
Se reirán de ustedes en el futuro de los fuertes... y saben el porque lo digo.... Ji Ji Ji.
🗑️💩🗑️
Music is perfect
Weird casting and language, less people more of my baby nebelung puffington mufasa Freedberg rawr! More dragon babies!!!! Rawr protect your fire rabbit mommy!! 🐇
Fool me once.....nice try, HBO.
Why didn't hbo dub this in hindi it will be a biggest hit in india
Where is Dayneris?
Don't like the guy who playing aemon Targaryen
I hope they don't get lazy with this man .
The last dragon, white-silvery one.. I bet that is Vhagar, looking at Aemond Oneye just before he will mount him as a kid :)
DRAGONS DRAGONS MORE BLOODY DRAGONS FORGET ABOUT PEOPLE WE WANT TO SEE OUR GORGEOUS FLYING ATOMIC LIVING WEAPONS
Bloody iron Throne
Epic
Dat pandering.
Were there black targaryens in the books? Because i dont remember.
Ngl the trailer is kinda weak but i will definitely watch as most of us will due to being huge fans of the original show.
Love from vakanda
Hindi Mai available kr do series
If this show is anything like the final season of the original GOT.... Then it's going to be truly trash. Pretty excited. :|
Happy birthday Jake McMahon weed lord!!! Goodly click click!
Please, please, don't disappoint me. It'd hurt harder than last time.
Here for the Dragons that’s about it
does anyone else think this looks just, bad?
Still have a terrible vibe from that joke of an ending to GOT. Those writings are the biggest disappointment in the history of television. Congratulations on ruining one of the greatest shows ever. Un watchable knowing the ending.
Well the opening credits should be the same as GoT they were legendary 🔥
Yes finally coming to see August 21 can't waiting 😍😍😍
🤦🏾‍♂️ race swapping.
HBO be like, here you go, here take an unnecessary black character. Enjoy!
The only reason I'm going to watch this is because of the dragons. I don't like the story, it's so brutal at its best, and I know what will happen to the dragons but hey, it is what is, I know.
# world best series.
They REALLY need to work hard to get the respect back from their fans after the disaster that was the original GoT. Hopefully it's like seasons 1-4, those were peak.
Dragons are back!!!! ❤️❤️❤️
Some parts of the music sound like Velvet Underground's Venus in Furs. Pretty cool. I really hope this show is good.
Added woke, I'm out.
No good ever seems to come from wanting to sit on the Iron Throne
Meh
So wait is aegon not going to be in this? Cause I remember the story was about him and his sister fighting for the throne and the uncle was like a wild card choosing whichever sided suited him best
War is a foot 💥💥💥
Won't waste my time watching this not after the complete stuff up of Game Of Thrones.
Eske eske
Damn! 🔥🔥🔥
Looks good but looks like it gave away huge spoilers and now I'm kinda disappointed
Team blackkkk! Let’s gooo!!!!!!
We all know this is gonna be bad, but the real question is will anyone care enough to actually see it
I don't if it the food that i ate last night or this trailer just gave me a major chill down my spine!!
2:30 is Vhagar right?
WIll Dany forget something in this series too?
hmmm 0 expectations 3 episode rule
Pray to the old gods, and the new ones! For this show to be half as good as early GoT seasons and that's good enough for me 😊😊😊
Don’t give me hope 🥹
house of the dorks
Just noticed while watching again. The dagger Alicent Hightower is holding is Catspaw (dagger used to try and kill Bran)!
Which dragon was that ...( shown at the very last ) ?
So Its Ring of power vs House of dragon officially! 🥺
it looks sanitized
oh no ... this looks and sounds sooo damn good. I might have to break my vow never to watch anything GoT ever again..
oh wow open mouth wide for PS2 cutscene vistas I clapped when i saw cheep CGI cartoon dragon. I cried when I heard regurgitated GOT dialog and story. I cheered for ugly no name actors I love HBO I love George RR Martin I love rehashed lesser stories trying to reclaim former glory
2:16 🥰🥰🥰
Can't wait till we get to see Balarion.
Dunno if D&D not being involved in this is a good thing or a bad thing.
Everyone that hated season 8 will be tuning in lol
hunter schafer would've made a perfect targaryen
Valar mugholish
Expect to see a lot of Americans on this show because unlike Game of Thrones they filmed in California.
The cast doesn't look as good as GOT. Let's hope the acting and writing matches the s1-s4 of GOT.
This cannot come out fast enough…
Weekly release of episodes gay
As expected... again Ramin Djawadi's composition is excellent ❤️
I would actually make it 3 seasons and then follow with a Doom of Valerya series, follow a couple of dozen Dragons with 100s of them. One other great piece of news is Ramin Djawadi is returning as composer, had the music spot on in GOT.
im so excited for this! finally!!!
Gee I hope none of these Targaryens sort of forget about the Iron Fleet.
"War is a foot"  -Guy
Looks bloody cheesy
omg awesome well done HOD team
This looks genuinely bad
Now, let the Games begin..... 🔥🔥🔥
It looks nice BUT..........no thanks, GOT's ending ruined everything...including prequels, sequels, action figures, video games and any sort of material derived from it.
Trailer Look amazing, VFX Is epic too, Hope Show Doesn't Spoil Itself like Game Of Thrones 😂😂👍
hoping melisandra appears the many centuries old witch that would be dope
This comment sections a bit sus fr.
🔥🔥🔥
I am wait, I'm from Bangladesh 🇧🇩😍🤩✌️🤩😍
Lets go, Matt Smith, Lets Go !
It looks pretty good but I'm so scared to get invested.  The foul stench of season 8 still haunts my mind to this day.
i know its a long shot but im hoping they'll be using the same opening music
Largest bleach and wig budget in television history...
I’m NOT feeling the music
The large portion of comments on the dragons frighten me. The show isnt about dragons, I fear this one may be. CGI for the win?
Dragons are coming to rule Emmys,
I am beyond excited :)
aah The show is being presented now as Action Blockbuster Show rather than GoT was in its early days but Dunno, we'll see
Please dubbed this series in Hindi
16.3k dislikes as a beginning not bad
House of dragons vs  ring of the power amazing.....
Are we going to see Aerys II ‘The Mad King?’
The bequeath of the crater of blood thirsty Iron Throne with exquisite poetry. ✨
Love from sri lanka 🇱🇰
Yeah this doesn’t seem so interesting.
disgustingly bad
This looks stupid. No offense...
SPOILER ALERT: Bran becomes King!
It's not GOT anymore for me it's New part of Godzilla
season 8 i will skip
Sasta GOT
Super  launch in india HBO Max betting
yes!!!!
I haven't read the books but it feels to me that both Alicent Hightower and Viserys seems a bit 'off'. Their characters/actors are not matched up with the others badasses such as Rhaenyra and Daemon, I mean casting wise.. But obviously it's just the trailer.
Winter is coming!
Another series ruined by Woke Token  Trash...just  like the Rings of Power
who else has watched this trailer like 100 times already 😂😂LFG
This show reminds me of GOT ending  and i will never watch this show
i can hates how the dragons look like
Maybe this can wash the PUTRID taste of season 8 out of die hard fans mouths😂
This will be an amazing show!
Looks wicked
One good thing is that the book only gives an outline to the story, never goes deeply into detail and this allows for more narrative freedom From the looks of it, seams like they're aiming at a 4 tops 5 season story arc
This looks garbage to be honest. They've made the entire thing about the iron throne and succession.
Never forget D&D ruined Game of Thrones with season 8
Please release also in Hindi language 🙂🙂
La música por Dios 👌👌👌👌👌
Game of thrones meets feminism….no thanks
Did they find IRL inbred people to fit the role and show the lore better?
I thought it was cool that all the dragons had slightly different styles of horns, it gives them a bit more personality
This has feel of GOT!
Release all of game of thrones in Hindi  Also house of the dragon 🦋🦋
The only good looking cast so far is that Knight Cole. Where are the good looking Targaryens?
Damn I guess I have to get used to this. Modern popular TV show franchise always looks amazing, Stranger Things, The Witcher, Better Call Saul, and apparently House of The Dragon would also probably look amazing as well. Basically looks wise all of them are like super prolonged high budget box office movies.
Hard to get excited when you know all of this results in he who shall not be named on the throne.
Ech.
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
The comment section is full of paid advertisements. Interesting that HBO is worried....
Iron Throne is stupid it should be a throne made from a Dragon Skull
Looking forward to Daemon and Aemond's duel above the God's Eye.
Chờ đợi mãi cuối cùng tháng 8 này đã có...!
I can’t wait to watch this!
Why are they all ugly? :)
Danny say:- born for seven kingdom and i will 🐉
Even though Game of Thrones ended badly  I still feel excited for this show 😍❤🤟🤟 LETSSSS GOOOO!🤘❤
Indians here?
The Dragons look awesome 🙏🏽 I can’t wait to see it.
I have zero faith that this will be a good show after last season of GOT, but I'll give it a shot. Hopefully this show can recapture the magic the original show used to have.
Who else was surprised by the black dude!
I hope there's alot of female nudity in this show
Please dubbed in hindi
I'll watch it for the dragons, but the boring "a woman has never been on the throne!" plot is so cliche now, it's not interesting. And in both trailers, the actress who is playing the lead wears the same completely blank expression, which isn't very encouraging.
It’s risky to get my hopes up, after the last time, but… my god, I’m hyped.
GOOSEBUMPS!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🐉🐲🐉
This series must be dubbed in hindi Love from India❤️❤️
Looks WokeASfuk
Can't wait
Please House of the dragon and games of thrones dubbed in Hindi language please 🥺
Bring on the dragons, because we miss them and we love them.
I love that the dragons looks individual from each other, unlike in GoT where they exactly look the same just with different colors. Here in HoTD each dragons has its own facial features and facial structures and different body structures, u can really identify one from another. Also they redesigned the dragons to be more biologically plausible. They extended the wings to go down to the base of the tail, cos in reality the legs and tail will droop downwards if theres no membrane there to catch air and lift the legs and tail.  In GoT the dragon wings only went down the dragon's waist, which is biologically wrong cos the rear part of the dragon will droop down when it flies real life per se. I love that detail. Also the flying animations improved, very bat-like wing flapping cosnthats how membrane wings actually move in real life.  Edit: i just realized, The iron throne will gradually lose those swords as the show progresses, which will lead to the iron throne we saw in Game of Thrones. The gradual losing of swords of the throne is also a metaphor of the targaryens slowly losing their grip on power and dominance and then they will get overthrown by the kingslayer jaime and the Baratheons, which is the beginning of Game of Thrones season 1.
Foisting Africans into this cast seems so appropriate
I'm pretty sure Bran can see all this lol.
Why would someone start a new series when the directors wanted to put an abrupt end to the last series?  Hopefully, the directors don't get tired and rush this one to it's end.
its milo time🔥
Ahh~ colors. Finally people learn that exist other colors for clothes instead of just black
Morbius?!?
Hey Amazon, check this out. This is how you do a trailer...
The trailer music just ain't itttt
Graham McTarvish would make an excellent Darwin.
House Of Dragon takes the charge form today. All shows there- say chao chao.
Ootha nayagan mendum varar 💥💥💥💥eattu thikkum payam tan ney🤩🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Queen rheanyra the queen incoming. Would have her role subverted bu another woman. That's what you call ironic.
Where is Aegon the II?
Glad to see the iron throne back ❤️❤️
Still would have wanted to see Robert's Rebellion series
They go down like flies... 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wow finally 🔥🔥
Epic
I wonder if these were the serpents of old mentioned in the Garden of Eden
can someone tells me the timeline of this prequel ?
Is this the backfire rebellion?
It’d be kool to see a GOT + LOR crossover.
Those white dreadlocks looks terrible.
Its been 3 years and no update on HBO Max India..
It’s looks epic.
The Rogue Prince and The Princess and the Queen were two of the best reads I've ever had.  This show is going to be incredible!
Great The real Last season
Honestly I like the idea of a GoT show that is just based around the power-grabbing and scheming. The last show failed in the final act because the showrunners didn’t know how to tie up all the loose threads. This looks cleaner and more streamlined.
lol bob marley died his hair
This looks epic and not connected to D&D so I’m in
Why are you expecting this series to be good? Look what happened to Kenobi. Or just look what happened to last season of GOT. Management is always the same, whether it’s Disney or HBO.
Please HBO Max release in india with hindi dubbed 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Finally, a bit of fuel to push me through my work weeks… Fond memories of many times so excited for new GoT.. I’ll never forget how pumped I was for Battle of the Bastards… I literally had jitters all day as if it was the Super Bowl and my favorite team is playing and “they gotta win or I’ll die” feeling .. never has a tv show provoked so much emotion out of me… I don’t cry or get emotional watching shows but I’m not one bit ashamed to admit that when Jon Snow was killed by the Nights Watch , I remember casually walking to the bathroom with a frog in my throat and once alone let out a big old bbaaahhooowwww Nnohooohooohooooo whyyhhhooohoooohoo face ina shower towel 😂
I love that I've read what happens.
This next month is going to be such a suspenseful wait. This looks PHENOMENAL.
This looks like a lot of politics - what made GoT so great and famous. Hope they stick to it.
Tired of seeing woke n feminism in movies and TV shows...
I thought Targaryans were supposed to be good looking.
Please take this series slow paced, and try not to rush anything like they did it in GoT.
Sequels are never good.
I wish house of the dragon will lead to the fall of the mad king after hall it's his house too. it would be great to end this show until the mad king's fall
must they ruin everything?  SO stupid looking.
Weren’t dragons like the size of dogs in this era? Cause that’s what they say in GOT. In GOT they said dragons had not been seen in a long time and the last of them were the size of dogs. And this era (House of the Dragon) is just 175 years before the events of GOT. I think they brought back big dragons as fan service.
how to train a dragon live action rated r
Looks good but the throne brings back memories of disappointment and you guys mailing it in for the finale.
Drink every time someone says Iron Throne
I'm so exited for the music. I've listened to GoT music for infinite times. I need more of it. <3
Game of thrones lost me after that last awful season, That was the end for me.
Hemme🔥🥵
I CANNOT WAIT OMG OMG OMG
This looks absolutely incredible, cannot wait!
Am stoked! Finally! Can't wait!
I cannot wait!!!
noone cares
Won't the Night King and the White Walkers appear in this series ????
I see they put more of our black people in more prominent roles - imagine that
This is how you do a Trailer Rings of power,Which doesn't even've a Direction.
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'll admit it - I was extremely sceptical, but that right there. That - that is Game of Thrones! Looking forward to it.
I miss Emilia Clarke here although it may be appropriate based on the story lines.
I just want to see even more in fighting for The Iron Throne. There wasn't near enough of that in GOT.
ITS MATT SMITH
The dragons are so cool
I've been waiting for this show for so long... it's not healthy LMAO. Can't wait!
So glad they went with this instead of that ancient one. one thing i was always desperate for in the original show was showing what it was like with a Targaryen on the throne, thats why the tower of joy scene is one of my favorites. its gonna be awesome to see an entire show about it.
BGM is heard like same as GOT but it is little bit improved.. 🔥🔥🔥.. please don't end this like GOT 😭
So at 1:00 is the new Jon Snow character. They show Rhaenyra as a child then as an adult. They don’t show Viserys as a child because he hasn’t been born yet. That “new heir” speech is given when the kids are grown up, but they cut to Rhaenyra as a child so as to confuse the audience. There is no mention of the Castle Black or The Wall. What do you guys think?
The people who disliked will never forgive and never forget.
I hope they make the dragons a bit more colorful than in GOT. In the books they're so rich with details, while in the show they're just grey.
it’s something about game of thrones dragons that just makes me so hyped
Just one request Don't Ruin It Thistime
Take a shot every time they say iron throne in this three minute trailer😂
I'm I the only one, or does the Princess sound a little bit like Daenerys Targaryen. uuu, soo excited☺☺
I’m here for the dragons
How many times did you watch this trailer? Me:YES!
Dam August 😩😩 should of been October
I checked my watch 3 times during the trailer. I DON'T CARE!!!!!!!!!!!!
Osm🥰
Feels like they are trying to make her the Danaerys that wasn't.
meh.
Ok, so it seems like the King Viserys wants to name Rhaenyra as his heir, his son Daemon wants to be the king, King Viserys decides to marry again and then chooses a whole new heir, and then there is fighting between all three who want to be King. Am I getting it right?
Not expecting a lot, but certainly looks better than Rings of Power
I really wish they cast more black actors to play Targaryans.
I hope to see Balerion alive even in just flashbacks
LFG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
BEAUTIFUL
House Of The Dragon India language in Tamil  Release date ?
Yaaawwwn...finish the books please, thank you.
Venus in Furs
Redemption
Once bitten, twice shy. Write the damn book George.
Still mad About how they ruined GOT
The problem i have is how super UNFEMININE Emma D’arcy and Alcock is as casting choice. Martin reallly emphasized in the works that a HUGE feminine energy and beauty Rhaenyra is. D’arcy will never cut it for me
A moment of silence for those who trash talked GoT back in 2019 and swore to never watch any future shows related to it but are now excited and preparing for this one 👁️👄👁️
I never thought I'd be asking for more politics out of my fantasy shows but after how GoT ended this looks fantastic, GoT season 1 and 2 vibes.
💥𝙁𝙄𝙍𝙀 𝙒𝙄𝙇𝙇 𝙍𝙀𝙄𝙂𝙉🥶
Dragons look cool, the rest..I dunno.
I couldn't tell, is this about inheriting the iron throne or something?
So it’s just Daenerys again
I see diversity hires. It's gonna be another Witcher, no thanks.
So who defeated the dragons in the end of this era before GOT?
😲😲♥️♥️💥💥💥💥
I don’t blame HBO for the disaster that was season 8. They actually offered Benioff & Weiss more money to continue extra seasons since Martin wasn’t even finished with the story. They take the L, so I’ll give this show a chance.
Who are you??? I am the Doctor......
so does this show take place right before Game of Thrones or years before it?
Goosebumps 🔥❤️
Nice can't wait
Again we have to wait for 10yrs to complete all the seasons..... Waiting makes me disappointed...
Woke alert. Count me out
Emilia Clarke is the only Daenerys Targaryen
Young Rhaenyra is so comely omg, older Rhaenyra have that sever looks I expect Rharnyra to have! This is gonna be great!! 😍😍
seriously, as if the whole "woman in power" storyline wasn't overdone enough in the orginal series. Sorry, not interested in another gender studies curriculum
Whole trailer better than season 8
I don't know why George RR Martin thinks that this can over throw lord of the rings catalogue 😴😴😴Fire&Ice  already became best fantasy ever from just reading the books🙄‼️💯 ...  Just Saying tho🥺🥺🥺Lady Alisson Hightower is my favorite character now💖😩 GORGEOUS ‼️🌸💘💕💌💌💅🏻✨
Me in one month:- It's time.
Let's hope the directors don't frick up the story at the end🤞
Finalmente uma coisa grandiosa e épica na TV desde que o Drogon voou para Valyria carregando a Daenerys 🔥🐲🐉🔥
Well ok, but when's it coming?!! Been waiting long enough!!
Let's see:  — Epic music with exaggeraded beats which synchronized with [head, hand alike] movements. ✔  — Rising tempo leads to sudden cuts and tacky dialogues. ✔  — Fast pacing shots of hyped-up characters (in this case mostly dragons), action scenes and important moments. ✔  — Epic sound effects at the shadow of every seemingly badass [one]line[r]s. ✔  — Epic finale with seemingly serene outro, passive-aggresively interrupted by the beast of the story. ✔  — Epic logo, appearing at the climax of a tense trailer, preferably with more one liner or either epic or stupidly serene music over it.  ✔  Hard pass? ✔
Im happy about Now dragon's had different disigns not different colours
I am ready! LET'S GOOOOOO!!!!
i miss the mother of dragons  Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) i miss her, my queen.... lol   john snow rat, i would never betray a queen, especially one that hot...lol
Guessing the ending was rushed
Meh
The long winter has ended for us GOT fans and the Summer sun is smiling upon us.
But will it be good enough to wipe the memory of that garbage pile of a last season out of the collective memories of all that suffered through it? Can anything be that good?
I swear to god this better be in 4k.
Just months wait
I Have hope for the casting…
Can we get another scene where that old lady says a woman will never sit on the iron throne? I didn't quite get it the first 3 times.
If you kept it going till now you have all the respect that I can give
Can't wait 😊😊😊😁
I’m debating who is the dragon at the end Syrax or Vhagar ? The shape and the look matches the dragon on the poster with Rhaenyra but the eyes on the poster are orange.  It also matches the description if Vhagar - Color of skin & green eyes. So I’m very confused  I think it’s Syrax and they simply changed his eyes for the poster to resemble fire + he is shown right after a scene with Rhaenyra and Syrax if I’m not mistaken is her dragon.
And of course, the main problem of the story will be about the iron throne again   I'm excited for the Targaryens though!
THIS IS GOING TO BE E P I C 😍
This is better than expected
Tough part is, how invested can you get in prequel characters?
the music is absolutely banging.
What a Music, Ramin Djawadi u made my day.
I have the book, should I read it? Can I follow the storyline about the book? They said the book is about family tree of early Targaryen how the story unfold into the sequel
Is hbo max gonna be in Middle East like disney plus as app on tvs ? Or not
the GOT-ified venus in furs soundtrack is SENDING ME 🥹 whyyyy
The casting is off...Rhaenyra is too young...did anyone actually read the short stories..?
*SHEEEEESH* 🐲🐲🐉🐉🐲🐲🐉🐉
I have no words but this; the wait is over!
Hopefully they don’t butcher the ending this time.
I don’t see myself getting invested in this after the fiasco of an ending of GoT.
Dragons aren't look real in this show... GOT had amazing dragon CG.
I'm really excited for this epic show. Dragons are Coming, they are literally Insane🐉🔥🔥 August 21st Come Here you Angel❤️
0:15 OMG DRAGON DREAMS (PROPHETIC DREAMS)   This wasn’t included in the book because, if you are not aware, the book is written by maesters so this justify the fact that there was definitely a motive of distorting the history of the targaryen family.   Viserys saw a war coming in his dragon dreams and he tried to avoid it but in doing so, he made it happen…
I like how people think this is going to be any good. GOT was good before dragons even appeared. There was a lot of beautiful dialogue coupled with strategizing the downfall of others. This just seems like a blockbuster.
*WE WUZ VALARYIANZ N SHIEET* Why? Why the token race changes?
Strong Season 8 vibes. Like they couldn't decide whether they wanted to make something good but complicated, or just turn it into a Marvel movie. And wound up with the worst of both worlds... I hope I'm wrong.
Finally, A prequel to Bram Stoker's Dracula. I wonder which line, Vlad the Impaler is descended from?
Trailer doesn't feel like GOT it feels like a YA version of GOT, but I truly hope it is good *fingers crossed* .
Why are half of the Targaryans black?
Amazing trailer
Better than Amazons Parody of LOTR
I think GOT better then this🤔
Is this really need making this after disaster chaos season.
I am so excited for this!!!🥰
Whats with the black people doing white face!?!? Fwahahaha!
“Shiny, shiny, shiny boots of leather…” Anyone else anticipating a CGI Lou Reed cameo?
How many years after is GOT? It doesn't look like their technology has gotten better from here. Lol
This is going to be better than The Rings of Power.
I am shocked at how little this excites me. Just not feeling anticipation at all. I hope I am wrong and this is amazing, but I am not vibing it even a little bit right now.
Cannot wait.
If this show goes back to the original strengths of GoT - focusing on the characters, politics and slow-burns to big payoffs - then maybe it'll be good. I know it's gonna take some serious quality content to make me forget the absolute garbage fire that was the last season.
i want a Khaleesi reborn series, can never let the great Daenerys die
I really hope that HBO doesn't mess this series up....
Iron Throne Iron Throne Iron Throne ... is there no other story worth producing in this whole universe? so boring...
Love the music! Looks epic!
😍😍😍
DRAGONSSSS
Bruh I swear i got the exact goosebumps I’ve got when GOT was streaming weekly can’t wait 🔥🔥🔥
The Bar:  Have Great Characters you can really relate to: John Snow, Daenerys, Tyrian + 20 others.  Tell a great story (80% GOT was pretty great), Epic Battles: 3. Hardhelm  2. Winterfell  1. Bastards.  Lots of Conflict.  Heroes you love to love and Villains you love to hate and deeply flawed characters who still have a chance for redemption....
I mean... it looks pretty good.. but I still have a sour taste in my mouth from how they brutally butchered the last two seasons of GoT... so ill probably pass.
armor looking alil plasticky
What's with the 15K dislikes? This looks amazing!!! The story sounds very appealing and incredibly well written just from the glimpses we've seen so far. The characters look great, the dialogue sounds rich and on point, the dragons CGI looks phenomenal... Everything about it is so appealing and promising. I don't get it. What's not to like? Can't wait to see this🔥
Even though HBO race swapped characters from the GOT books to APPEASE the WOKE RELIGION this show will still be better than AMAZON'S RINGS OF PRIME. I have Amazon Prime and I WILL NEVER WATCH Rings of "WOKE"! I would rather watch this even though I DO NOT respect George R.R. Martin like I do J.R.R. Tolkien, at least this looks and feels like GOT with all but the race swapped Valyrians. If Martin has no problem bastardizing the lore of his life's work & writing, then I will not defend it. Because the world knows Martin IS NO Tolkien! And Tolkien has NO ONE left to defend his life's work after his son died.
I want to boycott this show so bad but from the trailers, I can't wait to watch this
Black Targaryens ????
it looks well made etc etc but....as with all prequels...its hard to get excited or invested "when Im queen I will make a new order" - when we know that...she wont...300 years later fat wife slapping kings are still in power so...
We r excited 🤟
Slightly disappointed with how small Caraxes is despite being over 50 years old. I really hope Vhagar doesn't get scaled down as well. She's at least 4 times the size of Drogon during the Dance.
Yeah no thanks. Better  fix your final season finale because it killed my interest in that franchise.
beyond amazing..very good
Flop got is over they waited to long the they messed up
I can't wait first ep of season 🔥.
Finally ⚔️🔥
Lol Caraxes looks like the dragon from raid shadow legends.
I'm here for Matt Smith
Hoos of the Dwagon
Wait I didn’t realize how excited I was gonna be for this..
Why does HBO keep greenlighting TV adaptations of unfinished content? GRRM doesn't have the best track record at meeting his OWN deadlines as it is, thanks to the distractions of the Hollywood limelight. If he chokes a 2nd time and someone less talented has to stick the landing for him AGAIN... it'll be depressingly hilarious.
ill reserve judgement for now but the Dragons are epic. 👌🏼
Where diversity?
Hey remember when that blond bird had her period and murdered everyone?
Dragons aren't real 👎
Why is the nose of the dragon in the thumbnail a literal ginger cat?
This might be a dumb question, but who’s the black guy? Race and hair color are associated the house’s right? Seems like a pretty distinct character
I wanted the Starks story more. Ill watch it, but the north remembers...
Looks great
I loved old cast of game of thrones .
🔥🔥❤️
Prince Philip is a Targaryen.
❤️‍🔥🐉
I want to, but I just can't get excited for anything anymore. I guess I'd rather be pleasantly surprised than disappointed.
Criston Cole looks great!
Do you have to watch Game of Thrones to watch this? Like Better Call Saul is a prequel so you kinda need the context. I wonder if this will be the same
damn this actually looks good
is that Velvet Underground Venus in Furs as a medieval cover?!?!
A black targaryen? Heavens help us
I need 10 seasons at least!!!!
The black Targaryen is just ridiculous man
I really hope there’s a Littlefinger/Varys equivalent in this series. It was amazing to watch the game within the game, being played outside the game yet somehow controlling it
Let's f*ng GOOOOO!!!!!!
Fool me once... shame on you. Fool me TWICE... shame on me.
Is awesome 😎
Please don’t ruin season 8 💀🥹
After season 8. Im skeptical. Maybe if its free or pirated.
They literally just copied the song venus in furs...
It looks incredible, that's undeniable. We will have to see if it has the brilliant plot, dialogue, character motivations and character arcs which made Seasons 1-4 of GOT some of the best TV ever
I am probably not gonna watch this cause I don't want to watch another season 8
Is this a prequel or does it take place after the show?
After got season 8 i still don't understand why people still get hyped about this garbage, people never learn, they are mindless idiots with too much time to waste.
Here Be Dragons on HBO MAX. Can't wait.
This looks like a diluted woke version of the main show.
Tsk; they’re Targaryens, just marry them and have them rule as king and queen. Series over in two hours or less. 😏
Can someone explain the black targaryens?
So essentially the same story as GoT, with the same character trope, just with awful cinematography and colour-correction; looking forward to not watching this show.
This cover of "Venus in Furs" used for this Trailer, Does anyone know where to find it?
why the date is 21
Are we really gonna do it again?
LOL I love how the Targaeryans are no longer just a family, and not just its own race, but a race that includes multiple races. Seriously, that platinum blonde on a black dude as natural is absolutely ridonkulous
This is going to flop.   I hate what has happened to this franchise.
I’m here for the medieval sounding cover of The Velvet Underground’s Venus in Furs.
All this for a kid who walked in on some siblings doing it, leading him to be dragged around half way across the world and on a wheelchair to eventually seeing him on the Iron Throne. ughhhh......
ไม่อยากตั้งความหวัง แต่คงไม่น่าทำให้ผิดหวัง !
Kinda has that Morbin Time feel to it!!
Guilty of watching this trailer on repeat for the past one hour
I’m hardcore debating on whether or not to even watch this considering they’ve already cancelled it. It’s hard for me to respect the creation when they’ve given up on it before it even comes out. If it’s not as good as game of thrones that’s fine, don’t try to make it as good, just make what it should be and it could shine in its own way. Like Frigga said in Endgame; everyone fails at who they’re supposed to be, the measure of a person is how well they succeed at being who they are.
Amazing trailer, really captured the Game of throne essence power struggles. Dragons makes it better as always.
Love the Venus in Furs score
Dragons! Lookin forward for this ride.
Meh looks like GoT with moar CGI Dragons and B actors
Aemond One-Eye my love
To my greatest surprise, this looks VERY promising.
Oh it’s coming
If they didn’t ruin the last two seasons I might be interested 👎
That innocent looking knight (01:00) will definitely die.
Forever house whitewalker
0:43 His armor is awesome, look at that. wow
This just makes me sad how bad the GoT series crashed and burned. RIP
Ok....it's not looking bad. I might change my mind
Putting blacks in there looks absolutely idiotic
Yeeeehehesssss let's GOOO
Woohoo! Let's go!
YESSIRRRRRR!!!!!!!!
I hope it's not woke
Wow
i really hope the show isn't going to be as woke as this trailer made it appear.
But is it diverse, equitable and inclusive???
Hopefully white guilt doesn’t fk this series up.
So is this going to be like an epic battle of powerful empires and factions each with dragons in their ranks? Sounds epic, but I don't think I can't take seeing the loss of more dragons 😅
Listen HBO Max, I don't know or care what you have to do, but I want this show on 4k Dolby Vision you hear me?
I'm hoping they do the final touches to the CGI than what's in the trailer and where the incest lol OJ.
careful HBO, I've been hurt before
The dragons look really good!!!
Who's ready for another 8 seasons and a disapointing rushed ending?
Umm, where is Aegon?
Vhagar looks hugeeee
I like how they made the young princess look more like Tyrion Lannister.
TEAM DAEMON
Gods...I have missed Westeros so fkn much.
Watching on my porcelain throne
Oh🔥My🔥Goodness 🔥🔥
Fire will reign!!!!!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💛
The black actor takes me out of it. Doesn't look believable imo.
Every moment that I started to enjoy this trailer I immediately became sad about season 8. Considering that I've never re-watched GoT (and therefore cancelled HBO) I think it quite literally ruined GoT for me. I'm not bashing, it makes me sad to feel apathetic about the show that I spent every Sunday faithfully watching.
Why are there all these blacks in this show? Valyrians don't look like that in canon
The dragon's nose in the thumbnail looks like a cat
Dany’s dragons looking way bigger and impressive
House of the Dragon, brought to you by Starbucks(tm)
Super stoked for this one!
Remember, Daemon is a Pedophile.
Ill wait till this series is over to watch it because I'm not getting super invested in this universe again just to be massively disappointed by its end.
Can't be worse than Season 8
Not great casting. Doesn't compare to the original GOT cast in the early seasons.
🤔 idk about this
It's here boys
Everyone dies. That's the series.
Seguraaaa coração 💓🐉
sorry but this looks and feels way too much like a woke netflix show
All I know is Matt smith was freaking good in “ the crown”…. He’s gonna kill this role … can’t wait
Literal chills 😭😭I’m so excited I can’t wait!!
I never watched GOT, love this, it looks like a Medieval political drama with the elements of fiction, can't wait.
Ah yes.......the dragon version of 'The Anarchy' in England. Just so you know what I'm talking about look up the English King Stephen it'll tell you everything about The Anarchy in England which didn't end until Henry II of the Plantangents finally won. It lasted for 30 years and affected Wales, Scotland and Normandy. It was the bloodiest war before Wars of the Roses. If King Stephen met personally with a nobel for ANYTHING the said Nobel would be arrested. There's plenty to read about.  Look it up on YouTube There's a guy who made a 2 hour video on the civil war.
Is this before or after GoT
Now they see you as you are.   *SWOON*
girl power...yay
Amazon’s Lord of the Rings series looks like hot garbage. THIS looks like a fantastic fantasy show.
There's no chance whatsoever that this is any good. HBO just cares too much about preaching their ideals to ever make a coherent and believable story.
Need MOAR black washed characters
Why should audiences trust HBO with Game of Thrones ever again?
OMFG THESE DRAGONS ARE AWESOME
Have they merged Daemon and Aemond together as one character? Daemon never lost an eye. It was Aemond that had a missing right eye replaced with a sapphire. If they have, (SPOILER ALERT INCOMING!!!) who will fight at the Battle of the God's Eye, as it was a duel between those two on their dragons? Also, at 2:18. Is that Aegon II Targaryen with half his armour melted to his body?
Sorry they ruined the last series I want to parts of this
Looks like boring CGI woke garbage. Pass.
My oh my… sure does look diverse. I bet it’s really good….
HBO does not disappoint
Someone help me out, I thought this fight is supposed to be between rhaneyra and aegon ii?
I don't know ...still sceptical after season8
HBO please don't rush this down
Just came in to leave my dislike preforming my civic duty.  After season 08. I will not be lured no fooled again into being invested in this franchise.
جميل، اخيراً رح نلقى مسلسل ينافس قوت
Not again.
Damn, I thought this couldn't be possible but I'm a little bit hyped ngl, I know that the side I'm on, ends up loosing but still
They cut off Aegon, Aemond, and all the Greens? Are they nuts?
So apparently I'm the only one still pissed about the ending in GOT 1. You're not fooling me HBO!! I'm not watching this only to be disappointed again!!! Well I'll try not to watch it... fine I'll watch it. I'm gonna be judgmental though the whole dang time.
Hoping the show washes the bad taste of s8 out of my mouth but not holding my breath
Okay, I'm confused as to how many people are able to sit on the Throne, but it doesn't look bad at all.
Daddy Daemon slay pls
Meh... Pick a different book series. There's a lot out there that are amazing. No need to spin off for another decade.
War.... Is a foot
This looks way better than RoP.. I'll be watching this...
I'm hoping the winter isn't coming this time around because that was not worth the wait.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Was kinda hoping for a sequel focused around Drogon, but getting to see the OG dragons that were more than three times his size was better than I ever could have asked for!
You burned the fan's goodwill. This will flop real hard into oblivion..
Obviously..just say trailer.  "House of Africa" better than "the ring of Africa"
Looks like GoT dragon have more accurate design than this one. The face details and breathing fire is different. GOT Dragon looks more alive than this . Just saying
Search YouTube for: The Original Kings of Westeros !
Hope they don’t sacrifice good writing for shock and awe. Plz don’t copy of those dumbasses with game of thrones did
I’m not smart enough in these things to know so I’ll ask: can someone name the dragons that appeared in this trailer? Was Vhaegar in it?
As long as it's not rated PG then it will be fine. Need the action, violence, blood, gore and nudity!
Been following Olivia Cooke for awhile. Can't wait to see her showcase her acting capabilities. This is the perfect role for her to do it.
All of these just so Bryan the cripple to be on the throne 🥴
No matter how pretty the scenery is, when you know you are heading for a dump, it's still a trip to the dump.
Well. Time to turn my HBO back on.
I love the new physical appearance of the dragons, but the coloring is still too dull for me
Cautiously renews subscription, two episodes, that's all you get I don't trust your at all but I wanna see the dragons
OH.MY.
My only gripe is that king Viserys NEVER EVER had any intention of his brother Daemon being king.  Viserys named Rheanera because Otto Hightower and others didn't want Daemon to sit the throne when Viserys never had male heirs. Once the king married Alicicent Hightower and sons came hr still wanted his daughter to rule. It was the crowning of his son Aegon instead of Rheanyra that started the war. Daemon then married Rheanyra. Hr coveted the throne, but he was far down in the line of succession by the time the war starts.
OMG! I can't wait!!!
I’m excited if it was actually Princess Rhaenys who plotted to cause the Dance. She was talking both to the leader of the Green and Black factions!
I’ve been waiting for this a years
Looks like more of the same
This show better come out with a bang.  S8 left a bad aftertaste  and HBO needs to redeem itself.
Please make it as in the novel and keep it for 10 seasons or more
Everytime I think about canceling my HBO subscription they go and pull a move like this!! 🤣🤣
Time to dance with some dragons
Venus in Furs.
Shiny, shiny. Shiny boots of leather.
This trailer is missing the spark GoT Season 1's trailers had. It seems like it's going to be soulless, purely made for money, not because HBO cares
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Finally a trailer that actually looks, sounds, and feels like the series it's a part of. Take note Rings of Power and the Halo series. Just hope this show ends up being decent, I don't expect it to be better than the first few seasons of GoT, but hopefully it's just entertaining enough
Rhaenyra:   “When I am queen, I will create a new order. “  “I am to inherit the iron throne.”  Daenerys:   “I’m not going to stop the wheel. I’m going to break the wheel.”  “I will take back what is mine. With fire and blood, I will take it.”
I never finished GOT. Do i need to watch that before watching this show? Or are they really seperate
It looks epic, but will it have the same excitement given we already know the ending?
Im confused is that girl khaleesi?
Oooooh, this looks interesting. Is this part of the Lord of the Rings world? I see dragons.
Is that a cover of Venus in Furs? Neat!😗
Listen. HBO. You guys have all the framework there. You have all the writing you need to build off and give us what we want. Do right by me. Make our relationship OK again
Meh
Direwolves > Dragons
One of these characters is gonna die on the first episode right?
This remembers me in every aspect possible to the 7th n 8th seasons
I'll pass
I'm offended they chose to make CGI dragons instead of hiring real dragon actors.
Looks epic
so bad
The stench of the final season of GoT still lingers in the air.
Hard Pass, no need to watch more propaganda.   Oh wait, so you all think that the studio behind the original just sat on their hands and had absolutely nothing to do with how the show was run or written?  Do you think the studio would come out and admit it or would they just throw the blame on the "show runners"?   You do know that some of us actually were waiting to see "Winter is Coming", you know, something that they had promised us for the entire duration of the original only for a lovely bait and switch.  Never mind taking a steaming hot dump on all of the male characters.  Oh, at least theyll have plenty of material unlike the last one to draw from LOL.  Friggin idiots.
ummm. why are the targaryens black?  lmao! I love starting feuds xD
Everybody's happy for it to come. Me too. But everybody's going to cry because we will see each one of these dragons dying... 💙🔥🔥
That helmet at 1:08 looks like it belongs in 80s sci fi
Tell me that mf dragon at the end ain’t look like the 👸   It’s like them photos of old ladies looking like their dogs wooooof
I'm so hyped for this!
This finishis with arya killing the white walker no thank you.👌
Does anyone else see a cat in the thumbnail (instead of the dragons nose)?
I am trying so hard to not get hyped for this series due to Season 8 PTSD... I am failing miserably lol
This comes on my birthday, this has to be fate
How many times did they say Iron throne only in this trailer? 😂😂
Game Of Thrones is dead, I won't watch woke fantasy.
Alright listen, I’ve never watched game of thrones and after watching this trailer. I think I might just watch it. This was sick and entertaining
There is something distinctly jarring about seeing Bantu actors cast in a medieval fantasy story. Not dissimilar from seeing a Korean playing the part of a Zulu warrior.
Dracarys 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
series of the year
If it’s not directed by D&D  I think it will be just fine
Thin ice, HBO... Thin ice!
Some dragon breaths been waiting for this 🫠
Meh...
REDEEM DAENYS SLAUGHTER GIVE IT TO US HBO GIVE IT TO US🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is going to be so average, calling it now
The music sounds a bit like "Venus in furs" in some parts.
Meh.
I really hope this isn't going to be all about 'muh vaghina'
Another show of unlikeable characters all trying to kill each other and a dragon or two.
This show hasn't even come out and yet its already vastly different from the books.
This Trailer is better than Season 8 of GOT...smh and Happy at the same time .
In every epic, the dialogue is a British accent.
You know a series is gonna be good when one of the cast is a Time Lord.
GEORGE R. R MARTIN IS TRULY A GENIUS
D&D has nothing to do with this right?
Its as if everyone forgot how awful GOT got after season 4. Hope this is better quality.
I'm pretty sure that's Vhagar in the final shot!
dragon heart the series.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
1. Please stick to the book material  game of thrones was at its best when it followed the books.   2. The dragons need saddles!! It always bothered me watching Danearys raw dog Drogon. The Targaryens were in saddles with whips in hand, not just grabbing dragon skin and holding on for dear life. Plus there's a legendary scene in the Dance of the Dragons where saddles being buckled vs unbuckled is important. All you who have read it know what I'm talking about.
This looks MEH.
Can't wait till they butchered it again like GOT S8
This looks like everything GOT should have been and so much more. Finally a faithful recreation in a much awaited series of failed TV adaptions.
🔥🔥🔥
Yeah still too soon for me but good luck to everyone else 😂
Looks very bad. Really bad actors
FINALLYYYYYYYYYY
This is going to be amazing!
House of Incest
Matt Smith is going slaaaaay his role
an or a? HBO original series
i hope this show is not stretched until season 8
Knowing where all this goes in history, I really don't care at all. Nothing happening in this show matters, hindsight is 20/20. But I'm happy for folks excited for it. I hope it is good and gives them a great time.
Lord veleryon of the house rastafari from the jamaica isles.
Burn them all .
I do not know about you guys, Season 8 ruined the whole thiing for me. I am NOT interested in this prequel.
In the game of fantasy, HBO is PUMMELING Amazon.
I can't wait
Dance of the dragons!!! LETS GOO
omg wau, se viene
The Targaeryans (probably spelled wrong) look like those Wraith things from Stargate Atlantis
yezsir
Black Targaryens.. ffs 🤦🏾‍♂️
Idk why people in the comments are trifling about such little things; haven’t even watched it yet and people are being so whiny. Yeah the last season of got was bad but move on already, tf.
First "Westworld S4" and now "House Of The Dragon" i love you HBO Max <3
LOLOLOLOL, so now there are BLACK Targaryens... who have blond hair... this forced diversity is getting so beyond laughable...
Looks both expensive and pointless :-).
Ok...I'm Hyped. Bye!
Dr who is that you?
so we get 7 seasons (ranging from excellent to ok) then a final season cut in half with a record attempt at biggest f--k you for watching in tv history.
I CANNOT WAIT!!!
Looks dumb.
I can’t wait for the dragons on my screen again
I don't get it...couldn't get past episode one of got....its like a really expensive xena warrior
looks high quality and well done. Only thing that's bad is the need for them to include black characters when it doesn't match the lore. really woke and pathetic honestly. Race swapping is not good.
Looks great, WAY better than The Rings of Power anyhow!!
oh boy why does the trailer already have 13,000 dislikes? I just can't stand these kids who are already judging this show just because the last season of GoT wasn't good. Just sad.
Seems like a gender inequality soap opera show. I’ll pass
Wow, too many spoilers. Hope it's first two-three series
I hope this show is better than GOT just like the Originals was better than TVD.
I hope this also means we'll get a 2nd season of Crown of Candy on Dropout
Another woman going for the throne … boring.  Let’s see a Transgarean rise to power.
The visuals don't disappoint. But brace yourselves for the writing.
A black guy with bleach blonde dreads. Seems legit.
This is more exciting than Rings of Power!!!!!!
HBO , this time pls increase the brightness 🔆 a little bit .. it’s though to watch battles / conversations in the “ dark”  🫠😂
Dreams didn’t make us.Dragons Did.
I prefer to see Robert's Rebellion even though we know how it turns out.
0:50 rofl, pass.
all the bots talking about the dragons im interested in the acting and dialogue
Has the HBO Max app been improved?
i meaaaan ill give it a shot boi
lol at the dislikes, only because ppl still mad about GOT ending
i cant wait to not watch this
I aint the only one that saw the head move on the iron throne at 0:12 right?.. I think i just figured out something huge
The reason I loved GOT was bc of John and Ned. Not bc of all the ones that try clawing their way to top. I hope it’s a good show.
House of the Caucasian. 🙄
Looks good thus far. So excited.
Does anyone know who the dragon at 2:17 is?
The dragons are coming 🔥🙌
WE'RE HEREEEEE
Game of black africans.
What happened to music?
I'm here for Vhagar!
I thought you all hated it
they all look weird and cheap
I am so excited to not watching this! You stole 10 years from me and not gonna fall for it again...
Where da white walkers at?
90% should be dragon , if they cut cost on the cgi then it’s over . After the fiasco season 8 I have no hopes for this  Let’s see what they can give us after the garbage season 8 plot
Is dragons perfets
GoT resurrected this genre and 11 years later killed it
Exceting
More dragons please.
For the love of inbred albino families please let this series end better than Game of Thrones season 8. ❤️
Looks like they’re not doing the different coloured flames of each dragon?
🗑  🗑
*YAWN*
I hope they make us invest in this series for years and then fkk us all over with the shttiest most rushed ending ever 😍
Who does the step mom look younger than the daughter
No memeable quotes. The trailer maker learnt from previous trailer
So friggin cool!
Can't wait to watch this epic masterpiece fantasy.
Ok 🆗 I can't wait ☺️.
I wish cristin cole was blond
a série do trilênio
Cant wait for this masterpiece and for watching my favorite house
is this going to be woke?
Looks pretty awesome!! So which is the cultural appropriation the blonde hair or dreads? Asking for a friend🤣
See what happens when you let george fully invest in everything
fool me once etc...
Happy to see Olivia seens Bates motel
The young one looks like Dany
I'm excited for the theme song, music, action, and the Dialogue!
What is this about?
Nah..
I can't get excited over this after being so completely screwed with the final season of GOT.
GOT was the sh#t. too bad the ending was terrible
HBO Max is goated !!!!!!!!!
This show originally showed promise, now it looks like its a 'women are better and gaining power, but men don't like that so they try to do anything to stop women from power, PATRIARCHY!" This show is going to be garbage now and flop hard. Mark my words!
Once I thought I was out… they pull me back in. Seven hells.
So excited for this series! Looks awesome and has the golden feel of game of thrones.  It is made with good intentions and care, no wonder it looks the way it does. Hopefully I can connect to the characters more so than the book and actually hear them talk a bit more.
And after all the silly promos and adverts, all they needed was to drop this and now, now I’m in.
After season 8, yeah, nah.
Season 8 of GOT ruined this for me.
And official, this fall we will have the TV series match of the year  Tolkien vs Martin Arda vs Westeros Amazon vs netflix   Sword vs sword  Who are you cheering for ???
If it's not for alicent and rhaenyra. There will be no house of dragons 😂
Do people still think that "no *woman* has ever done that" is a compelling story? *yawn*
I am weiting
Civil war is upon us, the fire and blood will reign once again.
The Dance is here...
This looks more than a series in the witcher universe than something related to got
I love Rhaenys I can’t wait to see her riding Meleys
🤤🤤🤤
I am watching everything on HBO in pirated , till you tell me who the fck is night king
GoT worked because no one know how it would end.    Everyone knows exactly how this story ends.
If this show is anything like the books. Then its going to be truly epic.
Everyone rushing to give HBO their money as if the way they ended GOT never happened. 🤦‍♂️
This trailer alone is showing more dragon footage than the actual series promises.
Wait.. I have it on good authority from Thor love and thunder that being a queen is beneath a woman. The girl just needs to identify as a king.
Dam the doctor really took Amy’s and Rory’s loss hard
The music is fire
😍❤️❤️
PLEASE BE GOOD 😟
Dragons. Dragons everywhere.
Gotta be honest, none of the dialogue is jumping out here. It's missing the poetry of the books...
Yawn.  watched the trailer to see if I'd care.  It just reminds me of how poorly HBO did GoT.  Sorry guys, you won't be getting my money
Pass
I’m a simple man, I see a Game of Thrones related video, I dislike.
I'm not really sold after what happened in the original GoT.
Why, HBO?
This looks pretty good I’m surprised. Who is the black Targaryen? How does that work I mean Targaryens are famous for inbreeding how Is there a black guy in the lineage?
smaug?
Why am I gonna watch this so I can be disappointed in the ending again
Will this be available to watch on the Hbo channel ?
Valar Morghulis
How many seasons in before the writers give up on this and we get a crap ending?
I love Game of Thorne
I just hope this will be in 4K...
This looks like it could be even better than GOT season 8!
This comment section is clearly being curated.
I've never read the books just watched the show. How long before The Game of Thrones does this take place?
I want this series to succeed but that’s a uphill battle.
this will be bad..... Fortunately for them,  The Rings of Power is having all attention and all the bad reputation. So, nobody cares about this. If it was not for them, House of the Dragon would be in  bad shape.
I sincerely doubt this prequel will restore the good will that the original writers tarnished - and I also doubt it will be anywhere near as popular - but at least GoT fans will have something since Martin is clearly far too slow or lazy or both to finish his books.
This show looks too good to be true. Don’t mess it up like you did with GoT HBO!
Can't wait for the finale to be rushed and garbage
12k dislikes
The show looks promising but I'm still traumatized by the GOT ending . The ending literally ruined everything unless....
who's ready for the dance of dragons to begin :P.
I’m pretty excited for this show! Only thing is that I need to learn who the people are and who they are related to. It’s low key confusing especially bc I haven’t read the books.
All I see is Prince Phillip.
*shrug*
I may just give this a try. Please don’t disappoint 🥺
Are we ready ???!!!!
😭it’s gonna be soooooooo good I can feel it
daemon targaryen is soo awesome
Oh, I can hear the "Dracarys" coming!! The fire will Reing
In the end he didn't have to choose did he. Lol.  My opinion is he caused this war by changing the rules. He's an idiot.   Daemon wanted the throne. He's gonna get it one way or another.   Rhaenyra has been raised to want it. For the purpose. So in her mind it's hers and her children's.   Aegon apparently didnt want the throne but was scared his sister would kill him because he is a contender. His mother put the thought in his head. He'd have more protection defying her apparently.   They were not siblings.in blood but not in their hearts.   He created two rival branches. And then died.     Too many
I Don't know seeing how this ends up just doesn't give me much energy or enthusiasm to watch this
Is this entire comment section filled with comments from hbo marketing guys?
Please be good. For the moment this trailer is a healing balm for my bleeding eyes after Amazon's cheap crap called "The Rings of Power".
The dragons look so damn good!!
GOT തന്നത് സദ്യ ആണെങ്കിൽ HOTD നൽകാൻ പോവുന്നത് 2 തരം പായസം കൂട്ടി ഉള്ള ആറന്മുള സദ്യ ആവും ❤️😌  All the best from Arya stark fans ❤️  Love from kerala 🤗
Only one Month
2:15 HOUSE LEFFORD LETS GOOO
OMG! look how big vhagar is!
Thought they raced swapped the Velaryons simply to earn brownie points with the leftist mob, this looks a bit better than rings of wokeness.
Excited about this prequel, hope it’s an awesome successor to Game Of Thrones!
Forgive my lack of knowledge, but is this based on existing books? Because wasn't the fact that Season 8 was winged because there was book to draw from the reason for 8's downfall?
So it’s Game of Thrones: The Dragon Awakens. Got it
Let's go! bring on THE BLOOD WYRM!
Imagine this does better than rings of power😂
снова негры
Rings of power or house of dirgons
Holy crap Holy crap, I am getting goosebumps!!!! just little more than 1 month away
the tiny BLONDE chick has very ODD facial features to say the least. is she a crans manon human? Neanderthalensis ? she looks unfinished. was she a pre mature birth ? i hope they didnt cast her for INCLUSIVE reasons to have a disabled person in teh squad..
more of the same?
Well, maybe now I'll finish last two ep of season 8. This trailer seems good btw.
those still arent dragons tho, I want to see at least 1 proper dragon :( Trailer looks cool tho!
Black washing
Question is how many seasons are we getting
The Great War that Both Changed and Destroyed the World
❤️❤️❤️❤️🔥
Get those blacks outta here. This is not fresh prince in bel air.
Can't wait to see how many tokens and woke BS they try to throw in this.
I have to admit it  - I can't WAIT for this to start!!
Yeah looks like more of the same, Say "The iron throne" 20 more times blah blah blah blah
Wait what? Dr Who is playing Daemon? Then why is the trailer making it as he is opposing the blacks and want the throne for himself? Did they write of Aegon II all together or wtf is going on?
Team Black all the way! The production value of this show looks just off the scale, unearthly. From what I can see everything looks just fantastic and if the writing is also on par (which I believe it will be), this show will be on a never before seen level for anything in television history.
Hard to care about a prequel when we know the story ends in a trash fire of almost mythical levels. Il give it tepid curiosity i guess, but actual caring died with season 8.
Their wigs make this look like an SNL skit
I can’t wait to see this show.  If people think that things got funky on GOT wait until they see the brutal civil war over which Targaryen sits on that ugly throne.  The Dance of the Dragons should be a sight to behold.
No White walkers no GOT. The way season 8 ended this series is just a cash grab and pointless.
What type nof creatures are those big monsters?
All this in season one? I reckon its gonna be LIT 🔥
They dragons kinda look cheap don’t they?
Another series underway before Martin has even started the second book. We all know how this will end. After wasting 9 years on GoT not touching this with a 20 foot lance until it's complete. If ever.
No one cares after season 8 ruined the ip
silver eyebrows, that's an improvement
Oh, it's on ..... 🐉
A black man in a royal medieval court in England, come off it.
“an HBO original series” did someone not spell check this ?
Any one else sick of woke bull crap?
Can anything be original anymore. One crappy rehash after another.
wow impressed with the number of positive comments i am seeing, maybe i should harbour my doubt for a while
Can nothing be original anymore. One rehash after another.
What made GOT special was also the storyline of the white walkers…hope there’s some X factor to this show as well.  Dragons alone ain’t gonna cut it.
The dragons look outstanding.
Matt Smith!!!!! Let's go!!!
Man I better see a ton of dragons flying a round cause there was supposed to be a bunch of back than.
Snooze 💤
Looks great an all but is completely pointless considering the dumpster fire that was game of thrones. The house becomes a whiny chick who kills cause she’s mad. The world becomes boring and bland and and prequel sets up nothing.
Wanna know what’s sad? All this happened. Dany happened. Did all she did. Conquered all she conquered only for her to be killed the way she was. Sad. Anyway. Looking forward to this!!!
- insert a charismatic black man  *check* - insert emancipated and powerful woman *check*  HBO stop trying to fill social cases and do honest series with passion and taste for art, like you used to.  It’s so fake I had to check if it wasn’t Netflix
The dragon at the end is Syrax or Vhagar???
It was the dragons we bowed to.
waiting for😋
AI CALICAAAAAAAAAA
Please be good
Hindi m aagay ye yr
I hope that their Writers are better prepared for this...and wont GOT Season 8 happen again.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I can’t wait
no thanks you all ready ruined this property
"AN HBO ORIGINAL SERIES" - Is this American grammar or what's going on here?
Better than Amazon's LotR whis is Cosplay
i have a feeling that the only universally liked characters in this show will be the dragons
This looks 🔥🔥🔥
I loved when the dragon says "it's morbin time" and morbs em all
Lord Corys Velaryon is a black man (yes, with blond hair) ??? What kind of bad taste joke this is???? The issue of inclusivism in film and series is making a dreadful ridicule. I hope it is a fad that will pass as soon as possible.
This is gona be an amazing tv show
John Oliver and Stephen Colbert did a great job on this
Uh, why are there black Targaryens?
The thirst is real.
Cool trailer I like it, I wish the series were about the far far past, but its cool to seem dem dragons :D
Looks like another version of the Targaryen Queen story. Jesus y'all wokeness is killing franchises . I'll pass.
How can anyone watch this trailer and not get the chills?! 🔥
.... this book series isn't even finished yet either 🤣😭. Bro could've been released the second one by now. Ohhhh to be a GOT fan
Omyyyy goshhhhhhhhhhhhh
I loved GoT and I love the look of this but I can't help but feel like this is going to be a flop, I just really can't see why yet
May be night king again😈✨
What if this turns out the be better than season 8?
Anyone know whats good with the guy at 2:18 or 2:19? Is that supposed to be blood or cheese?
You guys better don't fking rush on this one...
This looks stupid too All these dumb cash grabs 🤦 How dumb do they think we are? Dogecoin to the moon
🔥 &   🩸
AHH IM SO EXCITED
sadly I dont care anymore :/  I still feel the bitter taste of the last season of GOT
SO IS IT AIRING OR NAH???
HBO must be really desperate for the money. They destroyed the GOT and now expect people to watch this rubbish. Only good thing about this show is the dragons. Poor choice of actors playing Targaryen who look drunk or uninterested.
Yeahhhhhhhhhhh it looks goooooood!
I love LOTR and GOT, but I have to say, this trailer is finaly giving us some grip on the narrative, characters and story!! Not just people looking up to the sky and some cool shots. GOT is winning me over at this moment.
After what you did to Ser Barristan? No.
Ehh. I’ll waiting to watch till after the first season.
Garbage
obviously got spoilers  What made me fall in love with Game of Thrones was the politics and the hidden motives of some characters. The way we saw the emotions of all the characters. Watching the Lannister brothers grow into something so different from how they were at the beginning was one of the most moving things I’ve experienced in entertainment (Tyrion’s trial for Joffrey’s murder for example). I want that same experience again but I feel trepidation.
y a w n. Pass.
Not sure but for me the production value looks below average when compared to GoT.
Bill Bixby....definitely.
This looks incredible awesome!  However I do not like all these big black men with white long hair etc? It just doesn't seem to fit into the Game of Thrones universe tbh.
There be dragons
Team Highttower
When did Targaryens manage to turn into n-words?
Is Balerion in this?
The more they show us, the more it looks like hot garbage
You guys know we saw the first one, right?
I hope this show is going to be good
I’m still unsure if that’s harry stiles
Wow wow wow so so EXICTED!!  Can't wait to watch it❤ Gonna be awesome🔥🔥
Why does Aemond One-Eye look that old?
This looks insane!!!
I hope it remains loyal to the books story
ياقوووووتكككك يا رايان كوندال 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Imagine if George Lucas never finished the prequel trilogy. Made ep 1 and 2, promised 3 was coming but years went by and....nothing. Then he said "hey guys,  are you excited for this new Dooku and Qui-Gon prequel series? 😆"  That's what we have here.  Why support it?  FINISH THE DAMN BOOKS!
1:32 When I'm Queen I will create a norder... That doesn't make any sense now does it
All I’ll be able to think about is the stupid places this storyline is leading. Matt Smith is pretty great though maybe he can make me forget. Keeping my expectations super low.
GoT bubble has well and truely burst because of Season 8...No thanks
Caraxes the Blood Wyrm looks awesome!
I'm hyped and looking forward to this show so much. But, I liked the last trailer better.
Our hearts all beat crazy right now watching this. 🤪 All I care about are the dragons and they look crazy good! 🤓🍿 Am ready.
Zzzzzzzzzz
Why does the Dragon look like Smaug from The Hobbit 😭😭😭
Looks so good
Does no one else hear Venus in Furs by Velvet Underground? I think it's an odd placement, or just a ripoff @:57 to @1:26
Oh are they doing the Blackfyre rebellions? That was a really interesting part from the books
Where are the White Walkers?
Anyone else pissed Aemond one eye just has an eyepatch instead of his sapphire
Ohhh it’s gonna be good
All of this just for Bran to become King. Not wasting my time.
once you go mainstream, you have to keep making stuff normies want to watch. big fights, shiny effects and cgi, boring trama such as love and what orbits around. i doubt this is going to have the same impact as the first couple of seasons of got accomplished
Nașpa, Iron throne în sus, iron throne în jos, negri cu vergeturi, nu știu ce caută pe la mare.
This will not hold a candle to the height GoT reached.
Yawn.
“Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in”
And GOT just got ruined by wokeness . Go woke go broke
As long as David and Dan don't have anything to do with this, I'll give it a watch
The balls on HBO to continue the franchise. They know it died with the last season. They have seen it in all the numbers like streams or sales. So to restart that. I give them credit. But please don't do me again like GoT. It really didn't answer a thousand questions you put in the series. So please. Complete it with actual care this time!!! Don't take ONE year EXTRA to produce NOTHING
Yas queen feminism, token black characters.....yup, it's as bad as we thought.
This had better be amazing to make up for the disaster that was GoT
Finally 👍
I remember in GOT them talking about the great dragons of old.. now we’ll actually get to see them. I am beyond excited for this show!
I wonder if Rhaenyra goes mad out of nowhere in the second to last episode of this show. Wouldn't that be fun
I've got shivers down my spine with this f* trailer. OMG! HBO doesn't play when it comes to produce masterpieces. I'm ready and BURN THEM ALL 🔥
Acting looks stiff and unnatural, lines are written simple and cheap, music is off -put, and the smell of woke is strong with this one. Please redo the season 8, and finish the damn books!
Boring
Looks really really dumb.
Here we go again
OK, after seeing the dragons I'm finally a little excited for this show. I hope the human characters don't disappoint.
Does anyone knows the song?
It will never beat Game Of Throne but it look good but not great only the sequel can beat it, that not the prequel.  Me like it like this way: prequel,present and sequel
So more if the same ….. backstabbing each other na dragons ….. the actor from dead man shoes is in this so I am intrigued ….. hopefully she’s good
Wakanda  2?
Looks lame and completely lacking what made early GoT great, but full of what made late GoT terrible!
One of my favorite actors, Graham McTavish is in this show. The Hobbit, Outlander, and now House of the Dragon. The cast is strong in this one.
Never got into game of thrones but i love me some matt smith
Do not want
Is this show gonna have the same executive producers as GOT? If so, I'll pass.
I wonder how many seasons it will take until they start using the "budget" as excuses for the lack of Dragon footage.
hohoho
This show will smash into oblivion Amazon's The Rings of Power!
Hopefully there wont be an “eighth season.”
Jenny Oldstones first song?? OMG thats amazing!!
Finally! Another show to eagerly anticipate every week and talk about. I hope the show will live up to the standard of GOT (excluding the final season). But from the look of the thriller, it appears we're all in for action and when dragons are involved, it's always epic.
the dragon is too small according to my imagination. It's ubercool though
Can't wait to watch Daemon morb in the season finale!
Will we see Balerion the dread? the biggest dragon to ever exist ?
I've never made a wig in my life.  I could make better looking wigs than these.
Queue the racists over  fictional characters
The best thing about HOTD is that we already know the ending. So, we won't be disappointed in the finale (That's for sure)
I just wish Corlys was more book accurate
Well...putting aside issues with the last few seasons and GOT, and some questionable issues for HOD, it certainly does appear from this trailer that HBO knows how to do fantasy way better than Amazon Prime. Though to be brutally honest, that isn't saying much since Amazon Prime set such a low bar with WOT. We shall see in a month.
looks good cant wait to check this out, especially after the lackluster ending of season 8.
Bringing Emilia Clarke back in some way would ensure this show's dominance. and feel good factor. pay her !!!!!!!!!
I wish they would stop putting black people in these medieval era shows. They just look so out of place and forced in because of "diversity"
Why do these trailers have like a useless mini-trailer before the actual trailer?
I can't wait. No seriously. Drop it NOW
Please don’t be bad please don’t be bad please don’t be bad
ngl this looks stupid
Is this being made by the same people that ruined the final season of GoT?
So uh... who's the brotha? Is he a race bent token, or an actual original black character?
Looks amazing
Hate to put a downer on this show but its pointless. We know the army of the dead situation etc. Would of been better if we follow up 50years after game of thrones and another story unfolds??! Sorry guys
porraaaaaaaa ansiosa vem logo dracarys!!!!!
One Character was clearly Revealed. Aemond Targaryen, or as he will be known, Aemond One Eye.
Are you on Amazon in a contest right now or who can produce the worst fantasy show based off of a novel
I thought this prequel was gonna b of when Aegon: The Conqueror and his sister-wives came to Westors. But it’s really the Targaryen civil war of “The Dance Of The Dragons”.
Ok, I am really excited for this!! I really loved the book
No Peter Dinklage. I'm not watching it.
Unless they're re-writing the last episode of GOT Season 8, I could give af about any spin off. Just a money grab
Archer Season: 4 Episode: 5 Minute: -10:28
Cant wait for season 8
Maybe I'm wrong, considering this is based on Martin written material that I haven't read, but:  Did anyone watch Vikings: Valhalla and felt like it was a stale soap opera just taking advantage of the original TV series setting in order to tell a boring written story with boring written dialogues and boring characters? This gave me the same vibes.
1:25 She looks alike Catelyn Stark
Dragon looks pretty bad in a few scenes but the rest looks great!
On my way to pick up my girlfriend had to stop to watch this trailer she can wait another 2:49 seconds
So many shills in here.  Smfh
Please do Matt Smith justice, that is all I ask.
this does nothing to fix seasons 7 and 8. only a fool would still trust GOT. no thanks
Akorát jsem nečekal že uvidím hrát v serii rod Mopů na podlahu.... Kdo tohle vymyslel. Ten by se měl na těch copáncích uškrtit. 🙄👌🤦🏻
All she has to do is be in Dorn when her father dies and the succession laws of Dorn take preeminence and she's the heir. Done. Solved it. No war needed.  You're welcome for the peace, Westeros.
I eagerly waiting for this masterpiece series ❤👍..love from Bangladesh 🇧🇩
Nope
Man this looking amazing seriously. Hadn't been this hyped for anything in a while. Not even the new thor lmao
War. War never changes. Wait...
Just got a chubby
Meh
0:50 Is that SisQo's great great great grandfather? SisQo I?
Oh man, I'm so excited to see both LOTR and GOT ruined, at the same time!
There will never be a greater dragon than LORD SMAUG - KING UNDER THE MOUNTAIN 🐉
Amazing Casts
Well I've just had an early birthday surprise and what more could I ask for " so don't let me down" on the 21/8. G.O.T I've watched umpteen times never fails to bore me,hope this series delivers
Bet all the people that said they won't be watching are choking on their words now
MATT SMITH EMMY WINNER 2023
Thank God they did not trust D＆D for this one!!! This looks magnificent!
Nice!
lol, is that a black targaryan lol!!! lolololololololololol
They're really hammering on that she's a woman and that people won't like her having the throne. Like yeah, we get it. I do want it to be good but it'll probably end up being woke trash
Imagine if this series is good, like crazy good, incredibly fun.. And then they like, totally ruin it by butchering the ending? 😂 How weird would that be??
This looks incredible!
Looks like better writing than LotR
It looks like a speedran g.o.t knockoff and all you furries can talk about is OoO dWaGoNs
Looks better then i thought it would
This is gonna have to be absolutely amazing to get back any of the goodwill Season 8 completely destroyed. Hopefully they pull it off.
The music  In the background   ah i love it.
Amazing how the very pale skinned valyrian's managed to become black. No one can stick to actual lore these days.
My girlfriend said she won’t watch the show, she’s single now
Dang this looks good.  The magic is back.
Matt Smith!
This is going to be 🔥!!
I seriously hope nobody gives a dime to HBO and GRRM to watch this show. After what they did with GoT, they don't deserve your money. Get yourself a VPN and pirate it instead of paying for it. Maybe then HBO will appreciate their paying customers? 🤔
my favorite was the last season of game of thrones. it was the best.
A black targaryen? Really??!!
Kinda funny the realm never accepted a woman and then Daenerys forces herself onto the throne and immediately snaps and kills everyone including children
Esperando ansiosa!
kinda boring.
This looks insane….wayyyy better than expected. Even the dragons look different. The level of detail is just mind blowing.
This looks amazing. Please don't mess it up in the end.
It's just money money money
Well, I've been dumping all over this for months but.  I'm hype.
Great, another production driving home the message of 2022..... Women are just as strong as men.
Naaaaaah, I dont know if I like this... I'm no longer interested in it, I'm more interested in jon snow's side story. I heard they are continuing it.
How can I convince my parents to let me watch this? i'm 15 and in NHS, but all my friends get to watch shows like Euphoria and the first Game of Thrones. I miss out on conversations because I have no clue what they're talking about.
Fuerzas superiores ayudan a quienes mueven el culo. No a quienes piden ayuda.
please please please be good
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Rings of power who ?
Rings of power WHO?
Alright my fellow Green supporters time to prepare to die on the hill on why we support the Greens once more.
A month out! 😎
3 years ago Drogon:mother you'll be missed😔😔😥😢😭😭 New dragons:you'll move on
Right now I think that this new GOT show will surpass upcoming Amazon Lotr series by a lot. In some way House of Dragon is gonna heal us from the mental wounds that Amazon will bring.
Oh my god! Can’t wait to see it.
i’m so….unearthly happy. my TARGARYENS🥹
To bad we know how it ends and its bad
Is the song Venus in furs by Velvet Underground?
Hopefully I can see the episodes this time!
King Aegon II the rightful King of Westeros.
Starks: fracassos e escoros de westeros desde os primeiros ândalos
seems chill.
EKse... eKse... ekse...
Venus in Furs
Fake views
Not sure I can support another GOT show....
OMG IT'S SMAUG😱😱😱
Hot damn! This looks good!
That armor at 0:42, god DAYUM!
I don't know if I wanna put my energy and time into another GOT series, season 8 still keeps me up at night
Is that a medieval cover of Venus in Furs playing in the background?!
In india where can we watch it or do we have  to use torrent
boy i can't wait to be dissapointed!
Let it burn 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I’m only watching if it’s 2 or 3 seasons long. If it’s 7 or 8 seasons long, forget it.
OMG OMG OMG I CANT WAAAIT
I can't wait. I'm going to subscribe to HBO Max today!!!
After that last series, no. Sorry, but no more of this thanks.
How am I supposed to take this as a serious Game of Thrones series if there isn't at least one Starbucks cup in this trailer?
Anybody think there are at least two better time periods they could have covered? Like Roberts rebellion would be cool because it informs so much of GOT and aegons conquest is the start of so much. Why this?
Bring it on🔥can't wait to experience the same vibe again..wow🤩
Who is the dragon in the end !
HBO you will never deceive me again! In honor of Daenerys I'm going to stay away from this damn series.
Look good but MY GOD am I tired of watching shows about ultra-privileged sociopathic royalty and their messed up schemes.
Wow... can't wait for more of "THE MESSAGE" to be thrown down our throats in this one. More "a queen will NEVER sit on the iron throne"... ohhh man here we go again. Time to take down the patriarchy right?
This looks good but Im not intrested.
Rings of Power,  watch and learn...
GoT was insane till season 4. 5+6 the cracks started showing, 7 was the beginning of the end, and 8 was almost unwatchable .  I watched the series again and finished it when Daenerys got her army on boats and was crossing the sea, and left it as a big 'what happens next, no one knows' moment because the ending ruined Al the build up.
nice. But stop changing characters. A black character must not be white. A white character must not be black. same for asian characters.   Targaryen are white and not asian or black.
🔥 🔥
Damm! This looks bad!
Meh the dialogue and acting is very wooden and generic. This will be like the Witcher.
This looks so boring. Like, give it up already 😫. Game of thrones is gone. I’m tired of seeing this same kind of story and these same made up societies. Give us something NEW.
QUE
Ramin Djawadi's music elevates this to perfection
PogU
The show looks so generic and forgettable just listen to the audiobooks.
So the three eyed raven saw all of this...... Any wonder Bran/Starks went to the lengths they did....to rid the realm of targs & dragons.....they got the throne but failed. Targs & dragons still live !!
Bruh looks incredible HBO max goin crazy respect its entertainment trailer gangsta no cap lol stay safe RIP Jak Knight William Hart pray for our world BLM God bless checkout the band The Main Squeeze 🙏
Same story a woman will take/ won't take the Iron throne come on differentiate from the other series geez
Is balerion the dread going to be in this ? Or does this take place after his death ?
2:23, ``My armor is like tenfold shields, my teeth are swords, my claws spears, the shock of my tail a thunderbolt, my wings a hurricane, and my breath death"
HBO 'bout to make millions from this, and I'm here for it.
I'll tell you one thing. Matt Smith is in everything these days.
This trailer makes me want to drive normal in GTA 5
If I don't see Milo dancing to EKSE by Off The Meds I'm gonna be more disappointed than I was watching the last 3 seasons of Game Of Thrones.
SOLD !!! I STILL LOVE GAME OF THRONES. I AM BIASED SINCE I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WERE BOOKS  BEFORE THE TV SERIES. The only thing I didn't like about season 8 was that Danny died? and Cersei. I don't think danny is dead since her dragon flew off with her. maybe they will fix that in the Jon snow series.
If your read the books u know what’s up 😁🤫🤫🤫
Not interested. Still upset by how badly they messed up the final season of GOT. Years of commitment for a lazy and insulting finale.
They took the worst of GoT (last season where only female characters matter and male characters are total wimps) and put it into this prequel. Shows that go woke always go broke. If they don't have any interesting male characters that behave like real people instead of being given a truncated psychology, this show will flop, same as Rings of Power.
Can’t believe I’m more pumped for this than A Lord of the Rings prequel with a quadrillion dollar budget
✨
No.
We all know what happens to them and that there will never be a Targaryen Queen on the iron throne, so what’s the point?
Pass
That Looks nice
Still no reason to sub to HBO!
Will be interesting to see how many seasons we get, personally I think the story should be done in 3 seasons. Keep it tight, plan out the entire storyline before filming the first episode.
Interesting… Not too sure what I think yet, but needless to say the HYPE IS REAL!
I smell an IP redemption on the horizon
lokura tete
WAR IS A FOOT LETS GO
meh.
Wig snatched and life was given to my soul!!!!
I'll give it a chance, but gonna be brutally honest, you have a really deep hole to climb out of. Never in my life has a final season of a show been so bad that ruined my love of a franchise. I'm not even interested in the books anymore...
Venus in Furs, by Velvet Underground ! Wow ! I loved it
Here we go
1:48  Is that BALERION?!
looks meh.
Epic!
GREENS VS BLACKS LET’S GOOOO
I love me some Dragons
Dragons only eat gold
🔥🔥🔥
For some reason I don't feel excited about it at all.
Was it my imagination but wasn’t that a version of Velvet Underground’s 🎵 Venus in Furs 🎵 playing in the background?
difenitely will be better then LOTR by Amazon
pass
The last season of GOT was so trash, I don't think I can trust this.
1:49 Balerion?
Amazon ring of power is a SHAME. HBO all day!!
Just keep D&D away from this and I think it'll be a hit!
Everything looks a bit too clean.
I love this atmosphere. Remind me a lot the 3th season and also a bit the 4th season of GoT (with more dragons)
I wouldn't be mad if matt Smith was actually the doctor by using his pocket watch to turn into a human and forget all his memories...
All of this so that a crippled stark who can talk to animals can become king 😂😂
Is that… the Velvet Underground I hear?
Cool Venus in Furs cover in the background there. Interesting choice.
I wonder whats gonna be the fantasy series of the year, HBO House of Dragons or Amazons Ring of Power.
That score seems to have elements of Venus in Furs from the Velvet Underground. Which would be cool.
Cbf
love how they ripped off the Velvet Underground for the theme. you’re not slick, let’s see if anyone else notices!
You cancelled Raised by wolves but not this crap show that looks like a feminist at netflix would make. Go watch season 1 trailer for GOT. Night and day. This show is trash wrapped in CGI
Copy from Game of trone!!
Wonderful i can’t wait to begin now 😊😊
We've either seen the most competent work barely cobbled together to make this commercial OR it's time to get hyped because this is only a taste Knowing the state of hollywood, one might say, "everytime a show or movie is soft rebooted, God flips a coin"
Looks impressive and fantastic.
Pls dub in tamil
epic meh
WOW
🫡
Nah…
*after* *destroying* *GoT,* *this* *will* *be* *a* *hard* *pass.*
Once burned twice shy. Many of the comments read like HBO marketing. This looks good but my first impression on the actors is they tried to use less expensive talent.
Not trying to come across as a debbie downer but can anyone name a prequel or sequel that has ever done the original justice?
i hope they show the biggest dragon alive here  just big dragon skull on the game of thrones
Plss dont be WOKE bulshit Plsss
Spoiler: some cripple named Bran becomes king at the end.
The music!!! Yaaaaas!!!!
Better than D&D The Movie. That's for sure.
🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥
soundtrack could be better
You did this to me, Matt Smith. YOU DID THIS TO ME!!!
How many years does this take place before GOT?
Se estrena el Día De mi cumpleaños
I think this prequel has less nudity than Game of Throne...so, i will allow my little son to watch it
Don’t like dragon cgi..
I doubt this show is going to be good. Everyone is way to quick to jump on the band wagon.
I think I just wet myself. Don't know how much longer I can hold my breath!
I. CAN. NOT. WAIT. 🧝🏼‍♂️🧝🏼‍♀️🐲🐲⚔️🛡👏🏼
the dragons look freaking amazing! rhaenyra, daemon, and alicent will carry the show, it looks like. I am so excited with the new style they're using for the music. It doenst feel like its in the same tone as GOT at all. totally welcoming that.
if they kill the character thay make the audience root for on more time !!!!!!i will burn the world downnnnn
Honestly, Alicents and Rhaenyras feud is a little bit too direct in that trailer for my taste. Yes, it almost all comes down to that if you break the conflict down but I honestly dont remember Alicent trying to stab Rhaenyra in front of the court. Wtf.
One thing I am most excited about this series is the opening credits ‘coz I just loved GoT’s so much!!
my hype on this is high! if something is going to deliver is game of thrones!
GOT is going to destroy LOTR. Amazon really dropped the ball, already had an established fan base but they completely destroyed Tolkiens work. Billion dollar disaster
Dr Who has moved on then.
Did I see/hear correctly that Rhaenys was giving Alicent the idea of taking the throne for herself? Cause that's not what happened! Could just be edited to look that way, or I could be confused. Rhaenys was a firm supporter of Rhaenyra because (spoilers for any who don't know). Trailer looks great though!
Surprising to see a Legolas crossover into the GoT world 🧐🤔
Wow!!! It looks fine as I expected, I really can't wait for this masterpiece! :)
Please HBO, don't dangle this in front of me and rip my heart out like you did with GoT Season 8. I want this to be good, it looks good; please, please, please: be good.
Esta bien mientras no acabe en mi...a como Game of Thrones. Ojala no la cagen
Did I see the cats paw dagger?
Looks really good, looking forward to that. Makes the rings of power on Amazon trailers look terrible
All these positive comments and I’m sitting here like … am I the only one that remembers the ending to Game of Thrones…
"choose your plan" I plan to become a pirate once again, yarrrr!
Hope paddy consodine gets loads of screen time. He's a legend.
Literally did nothing to endear you to anyone in this trailer. All politics talk and a dragon on its own or a sword fight here and there. Go back and watch you first trailer for GOT and try again.
Is this a GoT rendition of Shiny Boots of Leather by Velvet Underground? Or am I crazy? Or both?
It's a good thing they choose this story vs Duncan and Egg for the spinoff.  I would still watch it had that choose those stories but the Dance of the Dragons is way more epic.
Another GAME, Another THRONE....  LETS GOOOOOOO!!!!!
Not gonna lie, I lost all interest in this universe after GoT but this is dragging me back in.
It's Gonna Be Killing me🔥🔥🔥
If any show I want to be good this is it. And the fact that the Black characters don't just seem like background NPC's or slaves to be freed makes it even better. The director of "The Battle of the Bastards" is the show runner so hopefully him and the writers can give us the masterpiece Season 8 was supposed to be (or at least partially)
the game of thrones show runners confirmed that drogon didn't burn jon to a crisp at the end because he was a  targaryen. this would mean that the dance of the dragons was not cannon in the tv series universe because the dance of the dragons was basically a targaryen and dragon royal rumble free for all.
Fat man needs to finish the books
Spoiler alert: no queen ever sits on the iron throne. One highly traumatized son wins in the end. All the dragons die. No one gets a happy ending. Don't waste your time with this series either. I went through 8 seasons of Game of Thrones only for a nihilistic ending that made the last eight seasons meaningless. This is nothing but a lame cash grab with an even worse ending. I feel sorry for all the actors attached to this project. D&D deserve to rot in the 7 hells for destroying this franchise.
The Sea Snake would not have been a black man. Makes absolutely no sense. PC crap. I hope they can make up for it. we'll see....
Game of Woke!!!!!!!!
Rather underwhelmed. But hope it’s more season 1 than 6-8.
1:32 daenerys voice??¿
Lise öğrencisiyim 11'e gidiyorum. Aileme yük olmak istemiyorum YouTube'dan harçlık çıkartmak istiyorum bu kadar insandan 5-6 kişi bile görüp takip etse çok iyi olur. Şimdiden çok teşekkür ederim. Bunu sürekli belirtiyorum samimi kalın en iyi dostunuz kendinizsiniz kendinize iyi bakın.
Odds on Matt Smith playing the good guy? I think sadly pretty low.
Imagine loving this series too and the do the exact same thing they did in game of thrones. No thanks.
it has matt smith in it, so its crap by definition.
please allow hbo max in qatar
Ah and again they got me with the theme music.
Is that song "Venus in Furs" by Velvet Underground?
At least we can understand what this is about finally.
Looks like they used the Tyler Perry wig department 👀
This looks 🔥! It already has more likes in 4 hours than that busted LoTR trailer too 😂.
I must say the background score is blowing my mind.
While the dragons do look awesome, I’m still worried if that’s where 99% of the budget went into. I really hope I’m wrong, but I don’t want to get hyped up and feel disappointed afterwards.
I'll wait for the reviews, knowing this all leads up to Game of Thrones (so we know how it ends) kinda kills it for me. Looks good though
WE WUZ TARGARYENS AND SHEEIT!
Wait.....so there's black targaryans now?
I love game of thrones but I don’t know if I know it as well as some of the superior fans so I have to ask. Will this be around the mad king times or the king before the mad king times
anyways the Lannisters outsold
Soundtrack is on point
Looks promising. Hope they won't disappoint.
Please just dont let any of the AGoT Season 8 writers anywhere near this series.  That is all.
Still don’t her why Corlys and laenor are black.
1:17 « I’m your heir ». Damn I already love that guy.
Honestly love seeing more POC in this universe Lord Corlys Velaryon looks like a character I could end up liking.
Matt Smith was perfectly cast for this. That's the face of a Targaryen born of incest, not those super models you had on GoT.
Looks and sounds so much better than Rings of Power
Was that an albino Targaryen I saw??
Can’t wait for the neckbeards to show up complaining about the fact that it has POC with dialogue.🙄
Lotr or this? Ofcourse lotr.
We already had our feminist icon-Daenerys. YOU KILLED HER OFF!!! HOW DARE YOU!!
House of dragon & rings of power!!! A wish coming true after so many years!!! Thank you God!
Y va estar buena
Terrible
Why do trailers these days start off with an as for the trailer?
"Where is duty? Where is sacrifice? ....Where are the elephants?"
Fool us once...
After Season 8 the fandom of the show died.
I think this prequel is suppose to be a hint towards what's going to follow the game of thrones sequels and maybe even some kind of resurrection for Daenerys.
That's how devil looks like ,1000 times worse 👿👿👿👹👹👹👺👺👺
Was the final season perfect? No. But I for one still have a soft spot for Game of Thrones as a show and am very excited for this prequel series. I’ll definitely watch it when it comes out.
At last the franchise is rising again, the sun is ready to rise with dragon roar 🔥🔥
Well that doesnt look very good.
I like that they did a unique design for every single dragon like in the books and not like the ones in GOT with different size and color but the same design.very much eager to watch this series !!!
I hope this series lasts long and doesn’t get greedy and blinded by profits
Hope it's as good as the first 5 or so seasons of GOT and not last season level of badness.
The story is tragic and the ending will be depressing so I'm gonna save myself from watching another tragedy like the GOT finale by waiting till the series end and for someone who'll cut and edit all dragon scenes into 1 video and pop it up on YT.
😂 He's face still reminds me. It's morbin time !
Hbo max please dubbed all languages 🙏
21 Avqust mənim bayramımdı İnşallah🤩
amazing
Why do all trailers now start with a five second trailer for the trailer?
Will the episodes be released weekly or all at once? Super excited btw
Daemon got some Vigo the Carpathian vibes.
This looks amazing!
Prepare for another disappointing ending
Musics are good at least
Wow, dragons. How original. Not.
This looks great. Looks way better than that lord of the rings show
Zaldrīzes buzdari iksos daor
The theme song = Velvet Underground - Venus In Furs. I was racking my brains trying to think what it sounded like and just remembered.
Udriri Valyrio Eglio gūrēñagon aō bēvilza kessyt Zaldrīzo Lenton majēbilū.
valar morghulis
That was f$&king AMAZING! I’m IN! Can’t wait for the release of this series. 🔥🔥💥
It will be better than GOT
The female empowerment felt so natural in GOT but here it seems so forced. Bad writing kills yet another series before it even began.
Still the same trash. A blondy will fight against men for the right to get to the throne 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
Why can't you follow the book.. has the 8th season taught you nothing? Keep the excitement.. VFX can only help you a bit
“For every action, there is an equal or opposite reaction.” Maybe the disappointment and sudden ending of Game of Thrones has caused a positive reaction in The House of the Dragon. Maybe the ending of Game of Thrones needed to happen so HBO understands the beauty of the intimate storytelling in the early seasons of GOT and continue that feeling in this series. I am excited for this show because it brings the visceral tone back to Westeros.
I miss the STARKS
Oh God.. sleepless nights are coming.. Excited..♥️♥️
another phenomenal series inc
Ayooo is that the guy from Morbius???
How you gonna ruin this?
Wow! Looks amazing! Can't wait!
The original series is over. The older producers are not in this. Get over yourselves and give it a chance
Good thing this is available on HBO Go. Take my money.
Loving the Velvet Underground “Venus in Furs” remix soundtrack.
This looks amazing!!!
Ahhh can't expect the dialogue to be as good as it was in game of thrones seasons 1-5 but still looking forward to it
I want to be excited for this but, eh 🤷‍♂️
Take a shot every time they say “iron throne”
Oh.. Matt Smith will be🔥🔥🔥🔥
Show looks great , just don’t make us like it so much and then destroy the ending like u did with GOT
Evil cannot create anything new... Etc  No?
Hopefully the writing will be better than the last couple of seasons of GoT. Once they got beyond Martin's work, it went downhill fast. The trailer doesn't wow me however, I'll give it a try. Would rather Martin finish his series.
Can't wait! The music reminded me of Velvet Underground's Venus in Furs
Im happy I can wipe my memory of the last season with some new content.
I am so hyped for this!
Looks like a mashup between the walking dead and the witcher.. and i mean that in the most offensive way possible.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I'm much more excited for this compared to 'LOTR' series.
Splendid, now go HBO, feel free to ruin the show like you ruined Game of Thrones!
The way I see it, no matter how good or bad it is it can’t be worse than the final season of GOT :)
Will Balerion be in here to?! I HOPE SO!!
This is going to miss the magic of GoT.   Big Time.  You can take that to the bank!
Looks terrible
anyone else hard right now?
The acting is awful 😐
Couldve used a better background music
Every great fantasy epic needs at least one dragon. House of the Dragon has 17 dragons. It's gonna be epic.
So much violence for a chair 👀
I cannot wait
Please don't go woke, Please don't go woke, OH please don't go woke
I'm watching. I'm still hurt and these younger Targaryen women make me think of Dany and what the writers did to her and so many others, but I'll watch. Just with a bitter taste in my mouth.
Can't wait!!!
I will never forgive them for making the best show ever and then ruining it, but also, defo watching this...
This gives me goosebumps... as a GOT fan. I can't wait  😄
when does this free to play game come out?
Given how awful the last 2-3 seasons of Game Of Thrones were, I'm not sure they have bothered to make this! Sure the trailer makes it look ok, but rest assured it will be utterly awful!
The wigs looks so bad lmao
Omgggg I am so excited to see all the dragons!!!! Love how they designed drogon, rhaegal, and viserion, but I am looking forward to seeing differences in the dragons. Different sizes, and colors. Also really looking forward to seeing the dragon pit!!!! I hope they do it justice
Yes! Give me this now! I can't wait! This is going to be so good! It already looks bigger and bolder then GOT was in its first season, thanks to a budget! Wonder how many series they can get out of this.
HOLY BALLS!!!!!!
yes!
Maybe if I keep my expectations dirt low,  I won't be too disappointed
I needed this.
This show is trash. There is no such thing as a Jamaican targareyn
لا نريد خيبة امل مثل game of throns  ننصح بعدك الاستعجال في انهاء السلسلة
The them is w looks alot like got one
Ofcourse. Waste another ten-eleven years so the show runners can mess the end up. No thanks. I'll stick to my books.
Tbh i love the fact that the general public went from "nah i am not gonna watch this cuz of season 8" to "looks amazing, i am hyped" Good to see the fandom being alive after 3 years
HBO i am the biggest fan of got pls dub remaining got in hindi please
Well I never thought I would say this but this seems better than rings of power
Time for these dragons to DANCE
this looks like it will be better than Rings of Power
I'm honestly kind of jealous of the people who have no idea what happens during the dance of dragons.
Black guy blonde hair cool story.
When?
House of the Pale Imitation House of actors who look like they are Cosplaying House of the Dumpster Fire
*minor spoiler* Anyone else find all the possible political intrigue worthless when it ends with the mountain beating and eating this family
OMGGGGGGGGGGG
so, what new stuff have they got to tell us in this world?
Course I was humming the song from never ending story
I actually cried, when I saw those beautiful dragons….. 😂😂😂
Let's goooooo 🐉🐉🐉 I really don't care about the pathetic haters in this comment section.  GoT is in the past, let it rest. This is its own thing and it will be epic.  Thank you HBO
Terrible
The fandom, just like the North, remembers.
Next few weeks are gonna have some awesome fantasy content from this and from Rings of Power
Why a black targarien? Make no sense
Why is their a trailer before the trailer?
I’m watching for Matt Smith. MY Doctor, and a fine actor.
So long as this ain some WOKE bs, im up for it
Is this the Dance of Dragons?
Okaaaaaaayyyy
Fuego  y Sangre! 🔥
So it's just another show with a little blond girl who wants to be queen?
......  🤣🤣🤣
Hâte de voir ça :))
Still haven’t recovered from the madness that was season 8
When did doctor who get blonde hair?
Re do the last season of game of thrones first.  Not watching this till you fix the original series. Hurry up before aria is 45
Wow
Soo is this a filler story created by HBO max or is this a Rings of power situation where scribbling were turned into a full fledged series
so looks like they are doubling down on all the good stuff from the OG GOT so lets see what they do with this
Dislikes are white walkers !
I can’t wait! I’ve missed having the hype each week waiting for the new episode of GoT.
Chillls 😍
Succession but set in Westoros
I hate the casting
Rhaenyra :  When I am a queen i will create a new order . Daenerys :  I will break the wheel 🔥
I thought the Series ended Long time ago
Honestly they didn't wait to fill the comment section with "this is great" and "love the dragons" when is obviously a cash grab.
I hope they don't focus on " woman can't take the throne " feminism. Like we got it jeez, don't do it in every TV show. You not empowering anybody anyways, just shows and movies fail 🤡
Wonderful trailer 😄❤️👍🏻
“Fire is here” 🔥
After HOTD I wanna see Dunk and Egg.
Nobody cares ! ... the sower taste in my mouth of GoT left me not recommending GoT or anything related to anyone ... because why watch something that seem brilliant when you just can not decipher a good logical, captivating ending either it's dark, neutral or bright !
thank you.....
Can't wait for series finale to know if it's worth starting!
hyped!
Interesting, they should make a sequel to this one.
At least they did not forget to race swap.
Dragons, dragons and more dragons. I love it
Great, it's going to be about feminism. Again. :/
Incoming flop
The sad thing is this looks incredible, but after the crushing disappointment of the Game of Thrones final season, I have no appetite for it. HBO lost my trust as a viewer.
this should be made a sequel to GOT, but unfortunately its a prequel. this will be a flop !!
What an awesome story and world building. I wonder how this all ends when it's all said and done........
🐉 I am soooo ready for this! 🔥DRACARYS🔥
Can you say Money Grab?
War is afooot! ( in Indian accent)
My reign has just begun.... 😡
That's a real fire 🔥
Omg so excited.  When Rhaenys dies In season 2 fighting 1 vs 2. I hope she goes out in a blaze of glory she seems so awesome.
Seeing aemond one eye sent shivers! Whoever the actor is looks amazing. Can’t wait for him to be the next most f’d up villain.
so are you telling me this is gonna be about a young blonde girl, who wants the Iron Throne, commands the Dragons and everyone else dont want her there? hmm, sounds a little bit familiar :D
I really hope we see the cannibal the oldest and biggest dragon
I just wonder . Is Night King part of this series?
Now if Martin could just be bothered to write Winds of Winter that would be great.
As with all GOT content…music is🤌
Is this a show, or a movie?
If this is as good as Better call Saul is as a prequel I'm here for it.
1:09 Is that Shagga, son of Dolf?
Yes please
Is this show leading up to Aegon the conqueror or a completly different era?
Please be good .
🔥🔥
They better do those wigs some justice on those heads, dont have people out here lookin crazy.
W
can't wait next month!!
Oh I'm excited!
Some of those dragons are not very good looking like danarous dragon
Dang this looks great.
The Iron Throne will reign once again on August 21st!!
How can it be that this looks so much better than the lord of the rings series?
I miss Daenerys 😞
Not supporting nothing GoT related til the redo that last season 😑
AHHHH IM ACTUALLY SO EXCITED.❤️‍🔥
Let's Goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo  🔥👑🔥🔥👑🔥🔥👑🔥🔥👑🔥🔥👑🔥🔥👑🔥🔥👑🔥🔥👑🔥🔥👑🔥🔥👑🔥🔥👑🔥🔥👑🔥🔥👑🔥🔥👑🔥🔥👑🔥🔥👑🔥🔥👑🔥🔥👑🔥🔥👑🔥🔥👑🔥🔥👑🔥🔥👑🔥🔥👑🔥🔥👑🔥🔥👑🔥🔥👑🔥🔥👑🔥🔥👑🔥🔥👑🔥🔥👑🔥🔥
Probably more woke nonsense.
It looks great.  I'd be excited for this if I hadn't seen eight seasons of it in Game of Thrones.
This is one of the unseen adventures from the eleventh doctor.
So feminism?
It's kind of a bummer that the showrunners are racists that admitted to race-swapping Velaryons because they "didn't want to put another bunch of white people on the screen".
Not a fan of the English gentry style royals in GoT. I like them in other shows. Just seems out of place here, but maybe it was just the trailer. Will give it a look.
For those who don't know, The Dance of the Dragons was inspired by The Anarchy, an English civil war between Matilda, daughter and acknowledged heir of Henry I, and her cousin Stephen of Blois.
Not looking forward to another wimmen vs patriachy series but visually looks incredible.
Me looking at the new LoTR series:  "Now that's how you release a trailer you booger brains !"
Bridgerton, now with Dragons!
Really hoping they can differentiate her enough and distance her enough from Dany
I want to hope, but after the final season...I don't know if I can...
Will this show how the dragons all die ?
Are these just bots posting about dragons? Gee whiz, like we haven't seen them like a million times. I want a good story, which kinda seems dull in the trailer but ok.
Redo the final season of GoT and MAYBE people will care again, MAYBE.
Fire&Blood 4ever ! Glory to Queen Rhaenyra !
spero che la trama e i personaggi non siano rovinati dai soliti messaggi di inclusione , politically correct e tolleranza di genere... o assurdo femminismo oltranzista...
Oh no…. Don’t make this woke and horrible
Team Black 🐉
I expect nothing good out of this. At least their marketing is way better than Amazon Prime. Last chance...
It’s that Balerion?
Amazon < HBO
Meh
So much pain, blood, family betrayal involving ice & fire all for the Iron Throne
WE WUZ KIIINGS
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
dragons look different. LOVE THİS
Can someone please tell me the name of the soundtrack, it is amazing
The show looks awesome
1:48 Vhagar and Aemond? 😍
Honestly, I just dont care.
I didnt read all the books so I dont know what this is about. HOWEVER, it does seem weird that two Targaryen fight over the throne when they can just marry each other?
chega logooooooooooooooo
I don’t think they mentioned the “iron thrown” enough….
Pretty cool seeing the dragons have unique designs.
منتظرها على احر من الجمر   Good
Honestly.....I'm just here for the Dragons, f*#k everything else.
W O W
I don't want it.
"When a Targaryen is born, the Gods flip a coin." This show looks like it's going to exemplify that in spades. And I love how this show revives an aspect of Game of Thrones that revolves around the idea of everyone fighting for the throne and control.
Here Kings landing looks more modern 200years ago than the actual got??? did you see that?
It looks awesome, as a prequel to game of throne do you think it’s worth watching before watching GoT ?
Everyone in the comment section is praising how good the dragons look.  Seems like BOT activity lol jk hopefully they put as much effort into the story as they did with the dragons lol
This "who oh who will sit on iron throne" theme is kind of overplayed. I feel like there could be more interesting stories told in this universe. The GoT videogame RPG by Cyanide had one such fantastic story. But at least it looks better than that shite Netflix produced from my beloved Witcher books.
I thought they canceled this
Looks interesting to bad the direct sequel exist and we already know how the story ends. This is the biggest problem with prequels also the fact that GoT massacre the audience trust, gaining it back is gonna be nearly impossible.
2:16 WOW!!!
Really hoping this has the exceptional depth GoT was initially known for, and isn't just stylised reaction-fodder.
Can’t wait for the wheel to be “broken”…  Again.
2:15 Very targaryen.
Slightly more interested in watching now, but I still have reservations that it'll be crap.
Mmmm those dragons don’t look as cool as Drogon and the others 😒
....
Blacks in game of thrones 🤣🤣🤣🤣
The black targarians remind me of the black asgurdians in the Thor movies.. maybe some white wakandans are in on the way? Nahh.. being woke is a one way road
I’m sorry the black dude looks hilarious.
Only a fool would trust hbo again after what they did.
Oh, is this another teach me feminism show? 1:25 How unexpected.
sub saharan africans should not be in this.
The dragons look amazing. I already thought GOT had some of the best dragon depictions on screen, but they look even better here.
Is this wc in ugly blondis 😂
After wasting 7 years of ma life in Got, I can never risk another version of it. Good luck to everyone watching this....
Wow the cgi looks gorgeous
Too bad none of them look like how they're meant to.
Daenerys is the GOAT
Finally one of the best must waited series coming back 🙏🙏❤️
Drink every time someone says 'Iron Throne"
Sunfyre at the end!
so the whole show is about womens empowerment, OH I CAN BE QUEEN BC WOMEN ARE SO COOL!!! ugh lame woke crap
I’m here for the cannibal
Sending Chillss Common Dragonssss !!!!!!!!!
That soundtrack gave me chills. I'm so stoked 😍
Daenerys' dragons look way more badass than these dragons. I think Drogon is still going to be my favorite but we'll see. Gotta watch the show first.
🤘🏽
I love how D&D are not involved in this.
QUAL SERA MEU DRAGAO PREFERIDO EM
I wonder if this is the original music from the show. I can’t wait for the score! Ramin Djawadi is  🔥
CAT FIGHT!!!
I hope this is good. We'll see and I await judgment.
Venus in furs is that you I hear? ❤️
Damn waiting 🔥🔥
Please be good
Ok then
i hope its as good as season 8
why are they blackwashing characters? It makes no sense in the plot and in real life. Stupid.
What is with all these shows lately having insane budgets but only spending something like $3.50 on the wigs?
Poor Matt Smith just can't find any good roles after Doctor Who.
Was that an epic remix of Venus in Furs by The Velvet Underground?
The upcoming Djawadi rendition of "Venus in Furs"  teased at 1:36-2:08 is magnificent. Lovely stuff.
Wonder if we will get a flashback showing balerion?
Rhaenyra's actress looks like Lagertha
Carefully curated comment section... Never a good sign
GOD I'm very excited for this <3 can't wait !
another cancer in the culture
1:47 this has to be Vhagar and Aemond
Well, it looks like HBO won this trailer battle against Amazon. It’s not even close.
I know it's impossible but I want an Emilia Clarke cameo😭
Meh
I feel this will be  less suspense than other one...
The dragons look sick!
Is that dragon at the end Sunfire?
'Smaug - The Series' but not literally, because we don't own the rights.
This looks just stunning and the trailer is just breathtaking.... It will definitely be a unforgettable journey!
Most importantly... The D&D brothers arent involved!
This all seems good but I'm only going by word of mouth from trusted sources,  not getting burnt again
2:30 Vhagar! 😱
The graphics of the dragons look strange and unrealistic, in GoT they were more believable (
This trailer could’ve been better. It felt too disjointed and unorganized.
Looks 1000 times better than amazon's lotr
"Wah is a fusjh."
Oh God. It's woke AF :(
Nice orchestral Venus in Furs soundtrack
gay
the dragons looks small compare to Drogo
Wow. Got goosebumps and tears remembering GOT
Can't wait to have the series pander to a bunch of drunks in a bar that cheer whenever there is a fight or a dragon on screen.
Long live Queen Rhaenyra  Long live the blacks Long live the rightful ruler of the seven kingdoms
make sure you have writers who actually wanna write this time please
Hate the OG series all you want… this looks amazing
This doesn’t look nearly as dark, twisted and shocking as Game of Thrones was. But I’m still super hyped for it!
FINALLY!!!!!!     DRAGONS 😍
Record breaker web series 🔥🐉👑⚔️
More Shite
Did I just see Cheese? 🧀
This looks better than lord of the rings 🤔
Seems it wont be  as fun as GOT
oh my gosh! im freaking out
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
For some reason, it really bugs me that velvet underground is playing in the background. I like GoT (I'm a bit of a dork I guess) and I love Lou Reed, but I just don't feel like this kind of music should be played in geeky shows, it kinda devalues it or something
Erm. Some ugly actors in this one. Does not look anywhere remotely close to the GOT. I’m not feeling this at all.  Production sounds crisp though.
Omg I’m so excited, I can’t wait to see all the dragons
👏👏
Take a shot of Fireball everytime your hear “iron throne”.
"the Habsburg but they have got dragons"
Wow!!! Can't wait, Season 8 was awesome🤓
Looks like it’s going to be pretty good for casuals. For any fan of ASOIAF, looks like it will still be just as bad as we all expected. It will be toss up between this and Rings of Power for most disappointing tv series of the year.
Remember all the people who said they'd never watch a GOT series again.
Hic sunt dracones indeed
I"m going to have to wait for reviews on this one. I don't want to get "Game of Thrones Season 8'd" again.
The greatest trailer in all time😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Essa série vai da o pau na suposta série de o senhor dos anéis.
Can't wait to see the cannibal himself.
Your family has dragons.
Me: “I don’t know. Things ended badly last time.” HoD: “I’ll treat you better.” Me: “Okay!”
HOPE WE SEE THE OTHER HOUSES OR AT LEAST THE START UP OF THE OTHERS, IM HOPING HOUSE TYRELL AND HOUSE LANNISTER ARE MENTIONED
Meh
They should bring some of the old characters from GOT into this new series
is that Balerion  foot at 1:47?
CGI is fantastic!
That one guy being in this implies morbius exists in this universe 😱
garbage
Interesting to see everyone in the comment section excited about the Dragons, well done.
I feel like they've just told 90% of the plot in the trailer. Oh well.
OMG... those pixels :(
oh my.  this looks amazing.  cant wait to watch it.
"Hey remember how we screwed up the stuff actually based on books that exist? Well get ready for our encore!!!"
It sucks it seems like they're skipping over the first 130 years of the Targaryen  Dynasty to go straight to The Dance of the Dragons.
Loved 😍
HBO comes out with another GoT production  Me after season 8: I don't want it
I'm really hoping this is good. I love the Dance of the Dragons part of Targaryean history and I love Rhaenyra. I love her so much in fact that my 3 year old daughters middle name is Rhaenyra. They better not mess this up. The trailer looks great but Game of Thrones has hurt me before. It'll take a minute for it to regain my trust and love.
Yasssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss Queen!
WOW
Now this feels like the quality from the beginning seasons of GoT that everyone fell in love with. Please don't mess the series up 🙏🏼
I think I'll wait till it's finished, to see if it's actually worth the tine investment. The last one certainly wasn't.
The Reds, the Greens let's the war start
Justice for our Targaryan queen Daenerys
The forced diversification is gonna ruin what would've otherwise have been a fantastic show, calling it now
Could that possibly be the mighty Vhagar at the end of the trailer?!  Looks even better than I could have imagined!   "..then the storm broke, and the dragons danced"  🤩
Here is a death warrant to all the shows who thought they are going to be the next GoT.
Technically, these aren’t dragons.  They’re wyverns.
Not gonna lie, the trailers and teasers I've seen thus far completely blows GoT S1 out the water in terms of visuals. The only issue I had with GoT S1 was that. This show will likely not have that problem and due to the dragons it will be more fantasy as well. So, all they have to do is NOT do a bad job in WRITING and it will already be on pace to a better project.
Love Olivia Cooke! This trailer looks great!
"A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad act the good. Each should have its own reward."  - Stannis Baratheon  This show does not only have to be at least as good as Game of Thrones were, but even better. It needs to finally wash out the sour taste season 8 gave us, and restore this fandom to its former glory. Lets cross our fingers
Why no 4k trailer?
To people who always complain with other shows that characters have to much *plot armor:* As someone who has read the book this is based on I can promise you: *this is the show for you* ... 😁☠😲💀
"The iron Throne is Mine, by right" King Stannis The Mannis
0:42 this scene gave me goosebumps
This trailer makes me wanna watch all the GOT seasons all over again!
I’ll definitely be watching clips of the dragons, but I simply cannot support anything from george’s lazy a** anymore
I had gossips with the dragons look. I can't wait to see the world of my favourite family in song of ice and fire universe ❤❤
FIRE WILL REIGN🐉 🔥
Take a shot every time they say iron throne
Nah
Season 7 please..
HYPE HYPE HYPE!  This looks so good!
BLNM
Yes yes yes yess
At first I thought matt smith was a werid casting and his wig looked bad but he looks really good in this trailer. So i have so much hope
Can you imagine in just a few 100 years a Targarean named Daenerys would be able to reclaim the Iron Throne and burn down all the Targareans built for some reason despite already winning it back.
As usual; blackwash...
👎
Darius stormborn breaker of chains ⛓️ mother of dragons
Please be good as GOT ( not talking bout the ending) please please please 🥺❤️❤️
The elevator pitch for this was "Game of Thrones meets Succession", wasn't it?
i dont think this will hit as hard as the originals
I did definitely choose my plan...
But remember, in the end some cripple is gonna take the throne.
I can’t wait for this!!!
Still waiting for the big sword duel between Jon Snow and the Night King
01:48 is this balerion the black dread?
One thing certain, music is great
MISERICORDIAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Which dragon is at 1:48??? Look at that foot!!! It looks HUGE!!!!
Game of Thrones: A bunch of people make claims to the Iron Throne House of the Dragon: A bunch of people make claims... to the Iron Throne
it better be good
Sorry, already been burnt by a story of a Targaryen girl vying for the throne. Who am I kidding, I'm still watching this...
Goofy 👀💗🤌🏼
Will it all go to rubbish on the last season like GoT. Think I will wait to see if this is worth watching.
Caraxes looks more coked up than zombie Viserion. Nice.
Say what you want about Season 8, but I'm actually so happy to have more Game of Thrones back in my life.
indian want hindi dubbed
He looks like Geralt of Rivera. Also at 1:48 is that Balerion?
بمولاااااااااا🔥
Plzz dubbed game of thrones in Hindi plzzzz. I am from India
Dragons I'm ready to experience your Glory!!!!
Keep Milking the golden cow
unfortunately, it won't have even a half of success game of thrones. bad cast.
So make sure y’all working on season 2-3-4 so I can binge watch them!
Well, I feel strange saying it, but it seems from this trailer that there is a potential for a good show. But there is a potential for a bad show either. When I watch Rings of Power or Wheel of Time trailers I can be certain about negative qualities, but here I’m not that sure. Some worrying moments can be justified plot-wise, and I hope it is that way. Effects and costumes and decorations looks good, but if modern Hollywood taught me something, it’s that you can cover shite in gold, but it still will be shite.
Going to Litterally destroy woke wamen I mean the rings of power
Black targariens, "wymin powah", cut this сrap already.
Unfortunately it's going to be woke 😔
I can't wait for the August 🤪
I dont know man... After those last seasons, i have major trust issues.
Just wondering who is the protagonist
My pants just fell down   I'm super hype for this show
“There will be Fire and Blood” 🔥🩸
I'm just watching this for Matt Smith
Rhaenyra, Rhaenys and Alicent, what a trio 😍
The Iron Throne looks more accurate t the book's description. I wonder if we'll see the Starks in this. Stark is my favorite house.
Just to be safe, the guys who did the last season of GoT should be kept far away from this, that the thought of them directing an episode of this doesn't enter their mind.
Why do most of comments here feel paid??? Am i the only one or there is something fishy here like maybe something to do with fking up got s8 badly?
San Diego Comic Con Panel in 3 days. Can’t wait. Hall H is goin to be 🔥 🔥 🔥 🐉
Repeat with me: prequels are d u m b and pointless and always will be. No one cares. We know where it leads, and it isn't somewhere good. This is a huge misfire.
A series on Robert's Rebellion would have been a lot better and relatable as we know some of the characters already
uh oh
Lol look at these comments. It's so obvious they are bots. HBO didn't even budget their faux-marketing well.
RESHOOT S8!!!
so.. we waitin for the series finale to watch this one, or getting caught in the hype again?
Nope. Sorry, l o s e r s. You ruined this franchise. No one cares anymore.
This is like if Game of Thrones had DLC content.
Looks cool, hope they won't game of throne, I mean ruin it at the end
I aint paying for this crap. lol
So hyped!! I just hope we Get an explination for how rider communicates with said dragon, like if a rider wants to land a specific spot how do rider tell the dragon Hey land here. Hope they implament this, unless i missed something GOT never explained this
Dragon's body armour looking like the smaug
so who are the writers? better not be dumb and dumber aka  Benioff and Weiss who butchered GOT S8
GOT fans, who are assembled here🖐💥
Kinda showed the major plot of the show before it’s even out
I just hope they show Balerion in a flash back or at the start, before this story takes place
Hotstar
After Season 8 we’re all collectively over this.
Foda bagarai
Cant wait to see what harenhall and the dragon pits  looked like
Woke shite incoming !
That's a lot of dislikes on this video.
Omg... So beautiful music first of all
The dragons will be the best part of the series for sure, the other looks meh.
If the Valyrians are all into incest why is there one black guy?
This actually looks beyond amazing! Really looking forward to this!
Looks amazing, can’t wait!
Yeah.... I think i'll watch this...  I still hate the final season of GOT though.
This looks insane
Nice 360p trailer
This show is gonna rule the TV world for the next decade.. ❤️
I'm so excited and scared at the same time. I have PTSD please don't break my delicate heart😭😭😂
This looks absolutly amazing, plz god don't pull a season 8
I don't know why they're having so much trouble deciding who should sit on the throne next, we all know it should be whoever has the best story, right?
HBO you almost killed me my heart went so fast when I saw my notifications, OMG the dragons are coming ❤️I’m so excited!
Is this Vhaegar at 2.30? Im sure it is. She was the biggest dragon of this time.
Been watching GOT daily. They're playing a season per day. Just now is S5E9 where Stanis' daughter is reading The Dance of the Dragons book before he burns her. Her synopsis of that book is this show.
The House of Cash Grab
I will give it a chance for sure, so far it looks pretty decent.
lotr v Got, who ya got?
why do we need a good quality prequel when the sequel leads to the shitstorm that is season 8 of the main show.. i cant watch this because of that.
My GOT boner got killed so hard with season 8 that this just looks boring :(
A little too much melodrama. But the trailer actually looks passable.
The difference in Quality between the LOTR Trailer and the GoT-HotD Trailer is huge. As a LOTR Fan i was hyped when i heard about a Series coming. When i saw the Teaser, my first impression was "Meh". Another "Meh" for the latest Teaser. The GoT Trailer hit my Spot instantly. I'm hyped, i have Goosebumps and i want my own Dragon. I know HBO can deliver and i hope this will be Epic.
I am not yet forget the bad ending of the original GOT
1:17 exhale song, its morbin time .
Sound design is not so good actual ly
Stupid Hyped For This!
I prefer sequels over prequels and that final season of GoT really turned this universe into ash.
Nice
We aren’t going to see the dragons till the last episode or the first season…😂😂😂
Негры-блондины Торгариены это перебор. Такую шизуху смотреть не смогу.
Feels social justice through the House of Dragons. very unmemorable. L
I dumped HBO because it was too expensive to have so many streaming channels,   and I was really disappointed by Season 8 of GoT,  but now I am wondering if I should have it just for this and shut it off after.
This looks even better than Season 8 of GoT
the best show is coming
Can't wait😘
GRRM FINISH THE BOOKS!
Game of thrones and this do something different in regards to colors and how the show looks. It just looks real and nice. Other shows also have big budgets and nice costumes and sets, but they still look cheap somehow
Spoilers: Up until Cersei no queen sat the Iron throne.
I cant wait. “When I’m Queen I’ll create a new order”
I’m beyond ecstatic! Finally GOT is back… 🐉🔥😎
I am still mad in how bad season 8 was
Pls this time upload in Hindi also in #INDIA 🇮🇳🇮🇳 with good dubbed...
"Now they see you as you are"  Poor Rhaenyra, you didn't deserve so much suffering. 😢❤
The order of things? Founders got reach
Excellent... That's the Exclusive content of HBO 👌👌
For someone who hasn’t read anything about the series. This is like a prequel right?
I'm very happy that Ramin Djawadi is working on the music. It was one of the most epic things of GoT.
So glad it’s getting better comments than rings of power and I’m not the only one excited for it!
World "Dragons is Coming "🇩🇪❤
❤❤❤
Hmmm, Game of Thrones "Woke me up... before you go go..."
So wait…this is not a series about Aegon’s conquest? 😭
EPIC 😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳.. These people are Jon snow's ancestors 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️
Wow, the trailer looks really class, matured and confident tho 😮👌🏻. It screams "we are back" to GOT fans. The series looks rich af, HBO really spend big for this comeback. Hope they will do a justice for GOT fans with i believe they will. Can't wait!! 🐉
I feel like the inclusion of young Daenerys is low key a shallow attempt to restore the characters reputation after how the last season shook out. Ret con all you want, she still died a horrible murderous psychopath
"When I'm queen, I will make a new order" That sounds like something straight out of Daenerys's mouth
Zzz snooze fest. Looks like season 8 with blonde wigs.
Considering GoT was a flop at the end, I'm more impressed by this than Rings of Power.
Looks good, just arghhh. Can't get over the casting. I mean Deamon Targaryen.... I'll have to get over it.. but still, so many options and they went with Matt Smith... He is a good actor, please don't get me wrong.
0:52 looks like Milo is going to make this show more Morbtastic and Morbelous than GoT will ever be..
0/10 Girl power and diversity. The diversity doesn’t even make sense too, why would there be black and mixed race targaryens? Not only are they a family, they have children with one another to keep the bloodline “pure”.
This looks incredible
So close now, can not wait for this prequel!! 👍👌
You guys killed any apatite for new GOT content among the fan base. No true fan is tuning into this
All this for some spoiled brat to burn everything down cause she didnt get her nephew's D.
I'm just freaking happy that MATT SMITH is in here. I LOVE him!
This is an event that will be never forgotten, Thank you HBO Max.
Am I the only one not feeling this at all? I mean, it all seems very... professional... but what I see doesn't appeal to me, it looks like a poor man's Game of Thrones, and by that I mean Game of Thrones season 1 to 6. Matt Smith looks fine... the others? Not so much, men and women.
Wow can't wait not to watch it
Would have preferred a reboot if season 8
hypeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Yeaa, black valyrians!  Martin, is it how you really see them?! Is he really involved in this show?
I'll check this out for Matt Smith. Beyond that I have no faith in it and will have no investment in it. One massive let-down from this franchise was enough for me.
😃😃🥰🥰🥰
I don't care about the CGI; just tell me a great story like you did in GOT seasons 1-5. That's all I ask for
Anyone else hearing Venus In Fur by The Velvet Underground?
If this isnt shown in 4K imma lose it!!!!!!
niiiiiiiiiiiice poooooo9
I don’t understand, why are we getting this before we get GoT season 8?
I'm still wounded by GOT's last two seasons
As someone who has never watched a single episode of GOT, I'm looking forward to not watching this and being disappointed with the last season.
I don’t have much hope for this
Shurly this one doesnt end up like GOT ...
THIS LOOKS SO GOOD
Prequels have a hard enough time and the franchise was pretty crippled by those last two seasons. This has to be really good to get those good graces back.
Pretty excited let's hope this does not dissapoint.
We want vengeance for season 8 blunder!
HBO shills will hire anyone to write this POS, worse than Netflix lol
Caraxes, Vhagar, Syrax   ❤❤❤
WELPPPPPP this is literally perfect right ? It's the perfect combination of the book and incredibly well designed story. It's literally GOT, but new.
"The dream was clearer than a memory." 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
@hbomax what about Indian audience?
Oh goodie! /s More live action 'Sandle & Sword' nonsense..? New scrawny/frumpy broads for thirsty fools to gush over, for a season or 2 anyways.
Can't wait to see a youtube compilation of all the scenes with dragons. The series I will never watch.
I just hope it isn't like a dragged out Season 8.  The first 5 seasons of GOT hooked me with subtle acting and tightly woven plots.  They didn't even have budgets for epic battles.  If this series ends up being highly condensed spectacle, count me out.
WOW  cant wait to torrent this.
I'm the biggest Tolkien fan there is and I've never read one George R.R. Martin book in my life but I'm ten times more excited for this than the LOTR-Series. This looks insanely good!
I honestly think this show should be called “House of Whites.”
At least it looks better than The Rings of Power
hbo never misses
My heart is pounding with every beats of music it's just fantastic request you to please release OST
This trailer to me says we are moving on welcome back to Westeros we are building the world.
"I learned CGI just to make this video"  I'm sorry, that's all I can think of
This is going to be insanse <3 team red
<3 wtf
I spy the foot of balerion the dread
<3
Nice wokery
Think i saw lancelot...
Is that Balerian's foot I see? Seems accurate to size.
Im hype AF for more Game of Thrones
I was just reminiscing the good old GOT days when we used to wait years for new seasons and new stories. Me and my friends used to talk about that show a lot and make many hypothetical scenarios about the show's conclusion. I am having a feeling that those days will come back. Happy watching, everyone! ❤️
Is this timeline set before game of thrones?
Trash
To imagine all these were Dany's people yet she was left alone in the world at some point. And now Jon rides solo...
When is it starting?
Yay! Woke Game of Thrones!!! That’s what we need!!🤣
Please dubbed it in Hindi language
So it's like George's story without any of his wit?
After what HBO showed in few final seasons of GoT I’m not even planning to start this new mess to get disappointed again
ok I'm done, this feels epic, fantastic, visceral.
Just get the ENDING right this time!
My expectations are still tempered, could have done with a few more bulbs it looks dark
Fire will reign with Blood🔥
I haven’t finished Fire & Blood, so somebody please…tell me that was Caraxes.
This looks fantastic
How can a war be a foot? A window cannot be a jar.
To everyone complaining about then making Corlys black: who actually cares? They did it with Salladhor Saan and Zaro Zoan Daxos. I’m guessing you didn’t care too much about that. All we need is one line about Corlys having a Summer Islander mother or something and that’ll clear it all up. Of all Westerosi houses, black Velaryons make the most sense, as they are a rich and powerful maritime state, just like the Summer Islanders. I know it’s not book-accurate, but can we all just chill a little? Steve Toussaint looks suave and resplendent as the Sea Snake and I can’t wait to see more. I always maintain that changing a character’s ethnicity is only ok in if the change affects the believability of a story (eg in historical pieces), and in a world with dragons, blood magic and white walkers, a Valyrian family mixing with Summer Islanders seems pretty mundane.
Looks interesting though I’ve never watched an episode of game of thrones
If are interested to watch this show. Please remember GOT finale and the dissatisfaction. I Fking hate this franchise
🐉🔥🐉🔥🐉🔥🐉🐉🔥🐉🔥🐉🔥🐉🐉🔥🐉🔥🐉🔥🐉
Where is Cregan Stark?
Excellent. We will see our Dragons very soon. They have really put a lot of effort into the series. Just look at all the Armors.
The House always wins, baby.
Dragon roars. Horse whines.
Now there's a black character
Literally only watching for Matt smith who is probably the best character in all of game of thrones
THANK GOD FOR GAME OF THRONES HOUSE OF DRAGONS. BECAUSE LOTR RINGS OF POWER LOOKS LIKE CRAP RIGHT NOW
Sam showrunners that ruined GoT and said they didn't wanna have too much white people on screen? 🤮
"D'Arcy uses they/them pronouns."  -  Thank you wiki for telling me that actress is missing a chromosome.
Matt Smith looks amazing. Show looks to have good quality. Dragones looks cool. But the race bent characters are getting old when they don't make sense in the world. Wow are women the only one that have conflict and are in power in this time line. Looks like Producers learned nothing from season 7 and 8 of Game of Thrones.
I really hope we can see Storms End. The only major castle we have not seen yet.
I'm in
Yep, those HBO production values coming through.  The updated and more modernized dragon designs look good. Hard to get a sense from just a trailer but the scripting and worldbuilding seems pretty tight as well.  Gonna be an enjoyable watch.
I can’t wait to see Rhaenyra and Daemon brought to life.
Fire and Blood Babyyyyy 🔥🔥🔥🔥🐲
Go Strongs!
1:32 "When I'm Queen, I'll create a new order"____Feels like Daenerys
amazing, so excited
House of the dragon 🔥 Vs The rings of the power💍 Wich show will win our hearts??
Jousting with an open face helm is never a smart idea. I thought we would have learned this, by now, after The Last Duel.
Call me hyped!!!!!!,ahhhhh!!!!
I'm worried about the story, everything else looks fantastic
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Same studio but a brand new series 😍😍😍
My friends do not let reptiles fools you , its the same crab with  cheap plot  with woke and feminism flavour . SAY NO TO THE GODS OF GREED AND DIVERSITY
Please don't let it be woke
I dont know, Season 8 still hurts... ! Sadge
Booooring
Hope none of them “kinda forgot about the Iron Fleet”
Oh look, woke GOT. Really on the nose with the forced diversity. Lol
If we don't see living Balerion the Dread, it's a disappointment
I have no idea what is going on but I love it!
Can't wait but still don't trust HBO after season 8. I'm still not over it 🥺
Que obra de arte ❤️🔥
THIS i am hyped for!
Want to see robert and ned stark
After season 8 of GOT I was sceptical, but this actually looks really good.
HOW TF DOES THE IRON THRONE EXIST BEFORE AEGON STARTED CONQUERING?! Literally makes no sense and I've seen no one talk about this.
🤞 It's all about power and the iron throne all over again...  Thought we were past all that. But who knows maybe there's something underlying there
Is this going to be in 4k/HDR/Dolby with an actual good bitrate this time?
Everything is so book accurate! They clearly saw the reaction to the ending of the original show and thought naaah let’s do everything we can to avoid that
damn this looks significantly better than Rings of Power! victor already decided?
No thanks
Waaaman denied power by oppressive patriarchy. Waaman get revenge by destroying patriarchy. Waaman bestest ever.
Fake trailer
Just don't rush it take it slow
Give me winds of winder...not this crap
What a trailer! this will be far more brutal than GOT
Is it going to be on sky
Damn, I felt nothing watching this. D&D really did drive this franchise into the ground!
The music is just 😍
all of the top comments are paid or scripted ones
Palace intrigue oh my.
My only problem with this series is that they race swapped House Velaryon because House Targaryen and House Velaryon are both Valyrian houses so they are supposed to look pretty much identical with blonde silvery hair, purple eyes, very pale skin, etc. They also marry into House Targaryen and vice versions pretty frequently because they are the only two Valyrian houses in Westeros. So changing there race literally makes no sense and has no consistency to it, since every other house has pale skin so the darker skin tone would have died out within a couple generations of being on Westeros, other than forced diversity.
OMG it's really looking awesome 😍
Let's all hold our breath, until around Mid-Season...
I’m intrigued to see where this goes
Thank you Ryan Condal and Miguel Sapochnik for creating a such visually pleasing show
Hot damn! These dragons look awesome!
the giant dragon foot will be that of balerion? 1:48
I watch HBO max, your "What Daniel Dae Kim thinks you should watch".....I dont give 2 tosses about what ANYONE in Hollywood thinks I should watch or ANY other opinion they have. Keep it to yourselves! - An Irritated Subscriber!
ohhh my good more series of the year is coming!!! this is going to be great
Now we'll know how all the dragons die out
Queen? Same bs all over again? Plus forced diversity?
1/5 not enough dragons
I just don’t really care after that finale
We wuz Targaryen's.
With Amazon, you have a glorified fanfiction loosely based on events they do not possess the rights to and are forces to substitute the gaps with their own material, which is extremely obvious when compared to the quality of the late author.  With HBO, you have a proper adaptation of a well-documented period of the setting's history, with characters, events and fine details taken directly from the writings of the author, whose estate has granted its full support to the project.  I'm not a betting man, but if I were forced, I wouldn't favor Amazon in their upcoming competition this Autumn.
Best friends turned foes...This looks very very promising!
GRRM has its backing. And D&D are nowhere near this. That in itself is a win. I have no doubts this will be good.
It gonna be intense suspense🙀🙀
Can I see my boy The night king one last time?
It’s gonna be crappy like the original series. I bet they got an insufferable Cersei that’s gonna dominate the series because they think that’s what fans wanted.
I feel sad for Rings of Power series.....
Knowing how things end i cannot watch
Who would have guessed a Game of Thrones spinoff would be more appealing than a big budget Lord of the Rings television series.
The big storm is coming 🔥🔥🔥
Man, too bad the ultimate ending of this story is so damn atrocious that there is absolutely no reason to get invested.
Can’t…fucking…wait!
Feast for the eyes I'm sure let's hope there's no way they didn't learn from dumb and dumber ruining game of thrones massive legacy with rushed crap writing
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
MATT SMITH!! 😍😍
While I dig how it looks and feels...I just can't shake how the main series ended. I can't do it.
the Production value is just WOW!  And the people who did the Colour Grading (to set the mood/atmosphere) had hit it out of the park.  Is this show cheaper than amazon's lotr?  because's amazon's lotr looks soooo cheaply made when compared to House of Dragon.
Yes!
Game of WOKE
If this is like pre-season 8 of GoT this would be insanely good
🐉❤
It’s all fun and games until you see your favorite dragon die
The prince of the city. Daemon Targaryen.
fights in this one will be epic
കട്ട waiting
🤩🤩🤩🤩🔥🔥
Finally!! Omg so glad they making the dragons book accurate!!!
The Dance of the Dragons, The Blacks and the Greens.
I hope they don't completely butcher the lore. Not to mention Asoiaf grim dark feeling of the world, would hate to see it become just another happy standard high fantasy world.
The show will be awesome subscribe if you agree!!!!! 😜
Al fin💖
You tell me that didn't look good then  you're literally lying to yourself
Finally !!!!!!!!!!!!
THE MUSIC BRO.Ramin,you are crazy
Looks boring and the dialogues in the trailer are stupid af
House of the lizard ahh
Nice try, but I won't be fooled again.
At least it looks better than the LOTR show from Amazon.
I'll be very surprised if this show will has any significance. I think it's going to be averege at best.
1:48 Was that the foot of balerion the dread ??
H.O.T.D VS LOTRON  🤔🤔🤔
Would have been awesome if Season 8 of the parent series hadn't destroyed all interest and trust that HBO knows what they're doing...
This looks good and I'm sure I'll watch it. But I'm still feeling a little burned by GoT with seasons 7 and 8. The trailers for those seasons looked great too, but the season's left something to be desired for sure. So I hope this is better. But I'm cautious.
Looks awesome, but, words are wind, and looks can be deceiving...
Looks good, Rhaenera sounds like another Daenarys though
Holy shiteeee I can’t wait
❤️🔥
This looks breathtakingly beautiful, the fans have been longing for a new adventure for many years at this point, and already the universe holds true with similarities to game of thrones.  I feel sorry for The Rings of Power already because this Trailer and what the show is offering seems 50-100x better.
BGM ❤️‍🔥
it looks SO GOOD! the dragons look gorgeous and the sets and visuals look amazing as well.
On my happy birthday! Thanks!
Can't wait for them to make a great show again only to ruin it in the end.
Morbing time
I hate the fact that they race swapped Corlys Valeryon and his family, it's so weird and unnecessary, but I am excited for the show, I hope they can deliver good writing, most fantasy shows out there are awful, distorted and stupid. Hope this one doesn't join the gang.
Ill watch it because I have nothing else to, but I know this is gonna be garbage lol.
Let’s gooooo 🙌🏻🔥🔥🔥
This is gonna be amazing! I can't wait :D
Admit it, none of them are as perfect as the drogon.
Struggling to care after season 8
From 2:14, it sounds like the opening to _Believer_, and it fits!
Everything is fine, but black Targaryens... HBO in their manner... I'm sick of it.
Everything Great but Background Theme could have been better 🐲🐉
*Can't wait for this series to be absolutely brilliant for the the first six seasons and then be so bloody awful that everyone forgets about it after the finale.*
The music…OMG!!!!
Caraxes the Blood Wyrm and Daemon Targaryen. I'm so hyped! Let's go Battle at the God's Eye!
HABLA MESMOOOO
fuq the politics I'm interested on the war against dorne  they never won a battle until Daeron 1
Meh.
I can't wait to step into this fantasy
The actor with the eye patch who is clearly meant to be Aemond Targaryen looks a lot like the actor for Daemon. Am I mistaken? I hope I am, just please please do not make a character mash of Daemon and Aemond and ruin it all HoD.
HISTORY
hope the quality is better than the star wars series haha
The Battle of the Gods eye will be the best thing in tv history
Why can’t rings of power look like this
The dragon on dragon fights, especially in broad daylight or in the middle of a lightning storm is going to be insane. And they have to one up not only game of thrones but themselves every single season and time it happens. I hope they come to understand less is more with these dragons because that was one of the best aspects of the original show and George’s work in the books.
I can’t wait I’m freakin out
of course u had to have a political agenda
#renewraisedbywolves 3
Visually this looks fantastic. Let’s hope they can pull it off story wise
Our hearts remains as one - sitting close from each other  Our hearts were never one - sitting far from each other.   Dammn the rivalry will be interesting on this one.
Can’t wait to see the dragons and their personalities!
The new season of Succession looks amazing!
Man I just realized if she just gave up the throne her family would still be in power. She's pretty selfish in my eyes but maybe there's more to the story I can't wait for the show.
I’d watch this over Rings of Power.
I was really interested for the first half of this trailer. Then that lady started talking about a new order. So they're rehashing GoT plotline then huh?
Not sure about this at all.. feels like a cheap knock off compared to the original but I hope they prove me wrong.
Let's be honest: it's already better than Season 8.
One thing that I’m really looking forward to is that the creators of these spinoffs will truly have passion for the franchise.
plz dont be woke plz dont be woke PLZ
A black Velaryon?
DRACARYS 🐉🔥 !
So it is just the mother of dragons plot again, looks crap
I'm just happy Dumb and Dumber are not involved in this!
The rest is history
I hope its good but I'm not going to be disappointed if its not. The final season of GOT left such a bad taste in my mouth, House of the Dragon will have to be really good to change that.
At first i was like "WOW this is SUCH a rip off of game of thrones"...then I was like "oh wait...it is game of thrones..."
I hope this hasn't gone woke, like most TV shows nowadays.
2:06 Yoo, they nailed the dinner shot perfectly
Just hoping it’s more dialogue and less CGI dragons
Dual audio Hindi
doesn't do it for me, sry
Finally 😁😁
Is it  August 21th or the 5th
I love how colorful the armours and the dragons are, just like how George has described them. Everything was always too dull and dark in GOT, which is ok, but can be kinda exhausting to the eyes as well.
Watered down version of an Original
The soundtrack gives me goosebumps
Atleast they  could have taken a few pretty faces
Hopefully this is the “better call saul” to our “breaking bad”
Girlpower cringe.
Look really really great
The Targaryens - all dead Iron Throne - destroyed It looks great but what's the point of this really?
Matt Smith looks so comfortable in his role.  Here’s hoping this is GOT S1-4 levels of good and not S6-8 levels of bleh.
Looks amazing!  I just wished that they had Aemonds sapphire eye instead of the eyepatch he looks like he has unless maybe the sapphire eye is underneath?
They ran GoT into the ground so hard. After having knowing how this story finally ended, I really don't care for it anymore. It sure looks great but I felt cheated by GoT's ending.
The trailer "dragon scream" looks like "dragon fly" its going to "dragon stare" be one like that "dragon breathe fire" of a blockbuster "dragon walk" for HBO.
the wigs look soo bad,looks like the whole budget went to the vfx team,apart from that everything looks good
let's hope this is not a disaster of diversity + writer virtue signalling like some shows of late.
OMG  i can't wait
this looks so good, i'm ready to fall in love again
I read a lot of excitement about the dragons, but honestly all the cgi creatures and dragons were ultimately the least interesting part of GoT to me. I'm not sure yet if the characters and the plot will appeal to me anywhere close as much as GoT did, at least for its first 2/3. I have not read the books at all, so.
How many books is this show made off does anyone know?
Let me guess, every heterosexual male is gonna be stupid, every gay is gonna be super funny and super normal and every woman is gonna be the main character
Lol I thought this was a joke
This is what The Witcher should have been.
Oh dear god, please don't let it be as bad as season 8 of GoT.
Wonder if this will be good
GOT was great right up into the last year, that's when Hollywood stared to make up the plots. This is all Hollywood, so my guess is  its going to be bad, like the last year of GOT.
Will you promise us fans to that you'll make a great series?? And in the last season tank the whole thing with a crap ending?
I can’t wait for this!
Sooooooooo excited!!! House Targaryen for life! 🐉 🔥 🩸
🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡❤️‍🔥
I want to see Vhagar real bad but I don't think any shots of hers is shown here
I can forgive, but I can never forget the final season of Game of Thrones.
🔥🔥🔥
Purple eyes would be nice
Purple eyes would be nice
Is that Matt Smith,  doctor who?
Finally, a sequel to "How to train your dragon"
Lol ratio'ed; Don't think we forgot about season 8 HBO
I love how structured everything feels. Just like the earlier seasons
"I will not made to choose between my brother and daughter". I love the part starts from there and the music. This sounds like an HBO bro.
Who is doing this Venus in Furs cover?
I don't want to be this guy, but why is there a black man in a blonde wig? I don't understand. Who is he supposed to be?
This casting lmao
They had their chance, took us on a wild goose chase for 8 years and fumbled it in an atrocious way, this trailer hasn’t done any favours to endear me either, thanks but no thanks.
No matter how much they try, it's still just a copy of original and instead fight between several families, we have fight between one family. And point that everybody has a dragon, gives no excitement about dragons at all. And there is no excitement how it ends, who ever just watched TV show knows how it ends. They should make First Long Night first and than rest spin offs. In First Long Night we have no idea who were the characters and how it ended, who was the Princ that was promised etc etc. And they definitely can't make this show longer than 4 seasons without getting story watered and boring.
The last series was fun, I hope they bring the seasons for this series every year 👍
We are not worthy!!!
Omg!!!! I can’t wait!!!!!!
This has so much of the seasone one atmosphere. The misty, grimdark medieval vibe, it’s so special
Too many squishy humans not enough dragons
look like there is alot of annoying female characters and that black guys wig looks like a literal dogshit glued to his head. it looks very woke to me
One thing I can say is...with Game of Thrones, one of the biggest questions from fans has long been "when are the dragons coming?"  With THIS series, not only will we be getting dragons but it looks like there will be LOADS of them
We know what happens 😆
Big fan of GOT..Love from Bangladesh..
Por algo es HBO. La mejor
This looks a bit too clean, not as dark and gritty as GOT.
All Hail House Stark
You had me at mostly white cast.
I hated Alicent so much, team blacks all the way!
Expect disappointment. The dragons look cool Will still watch cause I like suffering it seems
Hype is real
Poor orcs have come to tickle the thumbs down with their short fingers :))) Go home to the caves!
I really hope this is good, watching this trailer i got more a feel of "Lord of the rings" than GOT, i hope im surprised when it releases
Damn Targeryens, always counting on dragons and treachery for more power and each time they play their little game, the realm bleeds.  Surely, something can be done about their sacrilige in Summerhall.  Perhaps extinguishing their fire with wildfire
This would catch my attention if it came out during season four of GOT. After a bad season eight — which I still enjoyed by the way — I couldn’t care less.
Hope it has the original music as an intro.
Is the big dragon Balerion the Black Dread?
I'm so excited, I can't wait to not watch this and ignore it after what they did to one of the best shows on TV.
WOW
ehhhhhhhhhm ima wait 1-2 seasons, you know see it ends like game of thrones....
I'm not going to get invested in another show with the ultimate question being "who will sit on the throne" only to have it end up being some nobody. And it's pretty clear the central plot is just that based on how many times the throne is mentioned in 3 minutes.
Anyone else hard?
Rhaenyra is my queen
Winds of Winter is looking good
Still have not forgiven you about Game of thrones tho
Wow it actually looks pretty good, too bad about the SJW agenda BS they always have to force into modern cinema.
GoT vs LoR ! A batalha das séries de fantasia começa!
WAR IS A FOOT
Jesus... the dialogues are so cheezy and cringy. Nothing like what we got in the first 3-4 seasons of GoT.
Nah they going crazy
I hope this show be at least 10 seasons, each has at least 30 episodes.
I miss the white walkers. They really were the drip that kept be tuned in, more so than the baby dragons.
Fun fact, George RR Martin ran out of ideas for names when he was writing the book this show is based on, so he started naming characters after muppets. That’s why a bunch of characters from house Tully have names like Kermit, Oscar and Grover.
just WoW!
Breathtaking..!! Dragons 🐲 Dragons 🐲 and just Dragons 🐲..!!
Okay, okay, this is before Aegon II is born just getting the show on the road, setting up Rhaenyra's power instead of starting the show with the Dance of Dragons.
Oh    my   God ......
Can’t wait to watch another game of thrones
We wuz dragon riderz and shiet
Yes yes!!!
question here: will it contain nudity and other unnecessary dumb stuff like that?  Please make it so others can watch it as well and learn from your initial GoT mistakes 😕
looks delicious....
Hey, Amazon: this is how you do a trailer.
I am excited for this! I wonder if we'll have a chance to see Nettles or any of the other Dragonseeds in S2 but that's just my mind thinking ahead.
Still 1080p and no Dolby vision in 2022…….awesome, Great quality streaming service.
TWOW not only remains unfinished, the author has no intentions of writing it.  There has been no acknowledgement of the epic disaster that was GOT S7&8, let alone an apology from HBO/WB  Please do not support this pointless product.
If G.R.R Martin is involved this show going to be EPIC
This is about to be good asf
We got this expensive set lying around so let's use it and fling together a superhero movie, I mean GoT series some sort.
Wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwooooooooooooooooooooooooooowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Team Blacks all the way 🖤🖤🖤
I guess we all are waiting for Balerion ..
letsss goooo!
Chills
Fire and blood.. yeah!
I'm gonna be watching this for the dragons and Matt Smith (however terrible that long wig looks on him)
House Velaryon aren't black, they from Valaria. Black people in this world are from the Summerset isles.  To the fake fans, I'm going to ruin everything you like, reply to me
Well, I have to admit it looks more exciting than the new LOTR.
I don't care for GOT bc of how they meased up the last sesson after I investing so much time in it only to be met with disappointment  .
Why is he black?
looks cheesy
Rhaeny is the new Dany?
Okay, I wasn't hype, now I am.
house of the dragon and the rings of power dropping within two weeks of each other? blessed
SO hyped to watch this!! 🐉 these dragons >>>
Alright I'm hype again
Looks a lot better than the rings of power.
Rihanna Targaryen looks badass!
I'm not gonna lie. I have goosebumps.
Holy mother of dragons ! This looks 🔥🔥🔥🔥
respectfully, im not interested
Caraxes!!!! 😍🥹
👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Why can't they let good things die.  So many reboots honestly just piggy back the original shows success but usually don't deliver.  Like the first 3 fast and furious movies were good and the next like 5 were worthless cash grabs.
I am ready to be hurt again
Cant wait till they ruin the last season
Can't wait!!!!
Why do the dragons look different in house of the dragon than they do in Game of thrones?
O boy what had the Doctor got himself into now
Oh Yeah The Dargons
The original Whittaker family
Well, I’m looking forward to this more than Rings of Power, anyway. This at least isn’t anywhere near as cringe.
Agh Criston Cole.. So cute.. yet so punchable..
The 🐉🐲 are back 💥⚡
I just pissed my pants....
Indian audience are going crazy for you guys!! Love from india ❤️
Saracens!
At least this is something. I’m not gonna get my hopes up just from a trailer.
After Game of Thrones ending. No point in even watching this.
❤️❤️❤️❤️
The best part is that the ending is already written and is pretty damn good.
Damn Damn Damn 🔥🔥 unique cast. looks fine to me.
I wanna see balerion even in flash backs would be cool.
Unlike GOT it seems they are stick to only small world of Dragons and Iron Throne thus no sense of adventure which makes it look boring.
As long as it’s not like the last season of GOT👍🏽
Looks like lame story-high budget but we will see
I’m just here for the dragons. Everything else is woke garbage.
I've said it for year, I'll say it again!  ALL HAIL THE DRAGON QUEEN!!!
Wow Westeros has zero technological advancements at all no matter how many hundred years pass.
Game of Thrones: House of the Inbreds lmao
I can’t wait!!!!
Kinda interesting, but the fact it kind of amounts to nothing with how the first show ended kinda makes it all sorta pointless being a prequel and all.
Looks good
Is this before or after game of thrones 🤔
I thought the story starts before iron throne
From a cinematic quality standpoint this looks much better than Rings of Power so far.
THAT'S COLD!!!!
I think I just came.
💜💛💯
That was Aemond Targaryen! I'm getting excited for this show. Hard to expect not to be disappointed.
I think the cast is not as charismatic as were in game of thrones . Every character in GOT was distinctively charismatic in their own way. But it's still early to say maybe they perform better than them who knows.
Isso vai ser épico! Me senti de volta ao universo de Game of Thrones.
💗❤️💗
It's great that we are getting the cgi quality of the last few seasons of got, just hope the writing is as good or better than the first few seasons of got (which were the best)
So you going to portray rhanerys to become queen throught out couple of seasons then in end after few years in last episode she would go insane and would be portrayed evil selfish like daenerys... thank you, i am done with your stupid plots
I remember vividly how last got season spoilt everything.it was almost a betrayal.have so much expectations from House of the dragons.cannot wait ❤️
Rhynera "When im a queen i creat new order" Somewhere...  Dany...
Ok fine.  I'll give GOT another go.  S8 really put me off but this looks pretty epic.
Omfg
Please let this not ne something they pump millions into just to abandon to lazy work later. I dont think the fanbase can handle another repeat of Season 8-9 of GoT.
The trailer are so fantastic, don't disappoint us House of the Dragon! The Dragons design are BADASS.
I forgot this was even happening
The forced woke diversity casting aside , this looks great
yeah,yeah,yeah,. No point We know how it turns out.  Just finish the dam books.
Caraxes definitely does look like a Blood Wyrm and Syrax looks like the mount of a Princess, majestic and terrifying. Can’t wait to see Dreamfyre Sunfrye Vhagar Meleys Vermithor SilverWing Seasmoke and Sheepsteeler
I am quite prepared to enjoy this series...thoroughly.
If dont destroy with nonsense woke crap maybe I will come to HBO but will wait
Ok let's gooo HBO..we need good storytelling
That's a HUGE NO NO! 👎🏻
Stunning 🖤
guys, give me a hint, which dragon is that at the very end?  Sunfyre? And 1:48 which Dragon COULD it be?  Hopefully Vhagar
Too bad the show was ruined, so who really cares about any foreshadowing
1:48 A huge one.. Vhagar perhaps?
movie cast smells really bad🤢
woo!
Wow 🤩 😍 🐉
After season 8 of GOT , I have lost all interest in this universe .
I need to know first who wrote this and is the story complete. Won't commit this time.
Keep D and D away from any writing please
I am sorry, but with a brief glimpse of cast members, I feel that it would be extremely difficult to recreate the same magic as GOT once was able to create ( except the disappointing last season). Its popularity would be like Hobbit movie series after the Lord of the Ring masterpiece! Recall the marvelous array of irreplaceable characters like Tyrion, Jamie, Jon, Danerys, Cersie and Arya, not to mention the super enchanting opening theme music and endless shock factors (unpredictable and innumerable deaths of characters like Tywin, Joffrey or episodes like the Red wedding). GOT has created a very high standard, which I am sure everyone would use subconsciously as a benchmark to make comparisons.
Shiny, shiny... shiny boots of leather.
Just by having GRRM in the production crew and NOT having those morons D&D I'm already excited
THERE. WE. GO. Finally a real series in this new world of Disney and Netflix bs.
I cannot stress just how little this is interesting to me.  No thanks.
Stunning visuals, incredible acting (from what I can see so far) and hopefully a compelling plot. Btw, what's the name of that song in the background?
See you in 10 years when this gets nostalgic
Hope David Benioff and Dan Weiss have nothing to do with this series and the showrunners don't fumble the ending
Just waiting to see ONE EYE Amond riding Vahegar and Demon on Caraxes.. ❤️❤️
Amazing
The dragons 🐉💕😍
Meh...
The hype is real
No Cersae. 😢
Summer is coming
Why would I watch this after the mess that were GoT's final seasons and the author's refusal to finish the story? I sincerely lost all interest in the Song of Ice and Fire universe
Woah, awesome! The dragons look incredible :) I read the book & am stoked to watch this series when it comes out
No Prequels can Wash the Sins of Season 8
Very interesting choice of music
So is each season going to be a time skip, or are they having time skips or flashbacks mid season? Or are they doing something completely different?
genuinely seems fantastic, hope we wont be disappointed
Nice! Looks promising!
Ayaz bhai tum bahut mast kaam kiya hai
LETS GOOOO
So good
Alright, FINE! ....I'll watch it
Is night king in this show
Looks so boring.
Looks like a clumsy attempt to rekindle the franchise... They do not have the same quality material anymore so it is going to be a mediocre fantasy epic focused on big moments and very little character depth. Pass.
I still can’t believe we are actually getting A true Fire and Blood adaptation. To actually see and hear what we’ve only been able to imagine before while reading is a truly special kind of feeling. Team Black to the end
Jon Snow isn’t in it. Don’t care.
None of this matters cause we already saw the end.
yeah, yeah, yeah,.  No point We know how it turns out.  Just finish the dam books.
Wow, looks amazing! The scale seems just as grand and epic as season 8 but with even more dragons!
They gonna hype up us and then will disappoint in last season..
Ehh looks ok
Looks like a major disappointment. I’m already bored and this is the trailer..
I’m glad we’re finally getting a glimpse at Rhaenyras personality. In F&B it’s hard to tell, and before that she was painted as, well, “Maegor with Teats”  But she seems inquisitive, intelligent, learning from older women like Rhaenys and recognizing the accuracy of their worldviews. I like that
As long I get to see a lot of different dragons, I'm good.
this cast is so bad it almost beat the witcher
Absolutely incredible 💙
This looks soo good. Eagerly waiting for this. And LOTR : Rings Of Power on Prime. That looks dope too.
OOOOOHHHHHH!!
Admittedly, I don't know but about this show, but... this trailer was WAY better than the "Rings of Power" crap that Amazon recently put out. No surprise HBO is able to pull this off better than Amazon. House of the Dragon looks great!
it's morbin time
Very excited for this, but what will make it or break it is the script.  That's what let GoT towards the end, but it was the script that helped us fall in love with the show to begin with.
im only here for the dragons
Meh…
wait did they make it woke?
Sick AF🔥
Expect disappointment and you will never get disappointed
keep churning trailers. middle ages succession stuff never gonna get game of thrones like mainstream audience. You need zombies, magic assassins, dire wolves and dragons to perk up boring politics for wider audience. Couple of dragon cgi scenes not gonna cut it.
Every one word is iron throne 😃😀
As soon as I heard the Venus in furs opening theme at 0:12 I was in..
Would be nice if there's a 4K quality.
All these struggles just for Bran to be king
Can't wait for Milo to say, "It's Dragon Time!"
Anyone who is still doubting whether or not HOTD will be faithful to GRRM’s fire and blood needs get their heads outta their behinds
meh
I mean
Where's my credit card!!!! HBO max let's go!!!
"Now they see you as you are" Then we see her pull the dagger towards her. Spoilers man...
Don't ruin it like the last season !!!
Please, for the love of god... Tell me dumb and dumber had nothing to do with this!!!
House of the Dragon ❤️ LIKE  The Rings of Power 👇 Comment
What’s the point since you ruined the ending of GOT
This is just Succession with Swords and Dragons
I'm surprised anyone cares after how dirty they did us last time.
With the way you guys cocked up the main series, I can't say I'm invested in this universe anymore.
Please deer lord dont crush them rush to the finish line like they with GOT! Becuase this looks AMAZING!
Another all wheeman are queens season then
I may have teared up,  this is too beautiful.
Anyone else thought they heard Venus In Furs start playing at 0:35?
This would be one of the most anticipated shows ever if HBO didn't allow D&D to destroy the Game of Thrones franchise. Sorry but if you want to revive your franchise, better fix the damage done in Season 8.
I hope this franchise never go woke
На мой день рождения! Ради Богов Старых и семи и новых! Сделайте канонично! Пожалуйста!
Matt Smith will probably dance in this show like he did in Morbius. Let's hope
CHILLS
Game of Woke
Wait this is written by the guy that wrote Elden Ring!
Some of the costume design in this looks good... the rest of it looks like LARP outfits I'm sorry
game of thrones reboot?
They screwed up season 7 and 8 of GOT, now they want attention for this medocre rubbish, redo season 7 and 8 of got
Valar Morghulis. 🔥HOD🔥TARGARYEN 🔥
I still can’t and won’t forget what they did to Game of Thrones :/  watching this brings backs the memories of GOT and how they ruined it at the end.
Ahhhhh Bautiful
Nope
Guatemala Present
"Our hearts were never one." That dialogue!!
Súper épico y hermoso
Gotta say my expectations are extremely low for this. Trailer doesn't really change that. Maybe I'm just bitter about WoT
BHE HAHWHUWUHAHWHHWUHSHWUUAUHSHWUUSHHWUWUSHHSHSHHS GOOSEBUMPS, BREATHTAKING, NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE, IM HYPERVENTILATING RN OMG, HOPE THEY DO THE SHOW JUSTICE 😭😭😭
me: this show is kind of a waste o- show: we have dragons me: 😵😵😍😍😍😍😍😍 OMG THIS SHOW LOOKS BADASS!!!!!
I literally got goosebumps Heads up nerds, Targaryens in the house .
criston cole and Rhaenyra talking in a scene?? i hope they explained what happened between them in mode detailed in the show
I'm very happy they are going with unique designs for each dragon, they all look so well realized
Even though I hated how thrones ended ....I'll definitely give this a chance
😖🤢🤮 hire some decent writers PLEASE!
Got chills. This is perfect. Never seen anything like this before
It's like they couldn't find lore-fitting people because of money. But it's because of politics
looks bland
Why are there soapy brown people in a White show ?
I just hope it has intense politics as GoT🤞🤞
Would love to see the dance of dragons, always imagined the fight above storms end
Meh
Never forget season 8.
YASSSS
I for one can't wait to enjoy multiple seasons of this and be crushed by all the characters making uncharacteristic idiotic decisions in the final episodes...
So basically Dragons are like nuclear in GoT world.
Looks shithouse
Wowwwwwwwwwww
It looks like the people in the comments needed to see dragons to get optimistic for the show ^^
Dance of the dragons > the long night
How about remaking season 8 with competent writers instead 😂🤣 #Season8StillSucks  #GameOfThronesStillRuined
Imagine Smaug in this :D
Making up for the lost seasons HBO? Well, looks like they made it!🔥
Okay... this looks amazing can't wait 😁
Have a bad feeling this will be painfully average
Plot twist: D&D are the ghostwriters for the series and the show turns out as you would expect under their power
why is there a trailer for the trailer before the trailer
Oh. this is still a thing?
song name pls
When viserys says “I have decided to name a new heir” he sounds EXACTLY like stannis. Listen w out looking
Vhagar!
oh crap we're seeing Aemond One Eye Also this trailer really gave very little away about the actual plot
DON’T CARE. FIX SEASON 8.FIX SEASON 8.FIX SEASON 8.FIX SEASON 8.FIX SEASON 8.
🔥 AND BLOOD Exited
Could be woker
Nope
What's with all the blacks?
Hyped!
this looks SO good...can't wait
No D&D, I'm not scared.
Screaming but S is silent
!!!!
Crying screaming tearing my hair out
It's very interesting how they're shaping this as a Rhaenyra vs Daemon conflict for the non book readers / non lore fans.
Yet another series centered around "I'm a woman", how original. With the last thing that came out of Game Of Thrones being the last season that ruined the world wide hype around Game Of Thrones to the point that people stopped talking about the existence of the series as a whole, staying away from this one seems like a no brainer.
another woke b*sh!t, black targeryen is like black blondie it just doesnt exist...
This trailer is better than season 8 of GoT
Everybody mentioned that they are excited to see but somehow it feels like this will be a bad show.
Oh boy, I'm excited to invest years into this and have the last two seasons be absolute trash!  I'm even more excited to be told by those who make those last two seasons trash that I'm the problem and had expectations I shouldn't have had.
They did a good job making the brother and sister inbred looking
Daaaaamn 😰🔥🔥🔥🔥
The production value on this show is top notch, think HBO is trying to wash the stink of GOT final few seasons
as long as Benioff and Weiss aren't invovled, I'm in!
this looks so good
We are going to see Corlys and Daemon war in the stepstones. I was hoping they would show that part as the prequel war. Wish granted
Iduno. Maybe.
No.
Pretty impressed with this trailer, needed something to look forward to as Ring of Power is likely to be garbage.
Everything excellent. Great costume design as always too
dinosaur's  dragons and monsters want we want
I think the creators will do everything they can to avoid the disaster that was GOT's ending
Name a prequel that's (1) better than the original story and (2) is not a cash grab.
Simplemente gracias HBO
This trailer improves upon the teaser. Now it's definitely worth watching.
This look lit 👏💗 HBO pls reshoot the last season of GOT with solid script
ok, where in the timeline is this??
Eagerly waiting for more incest!
That dagger the red head is holding was the one used to assassinat Bran.
Danny should have had her dragons be given Armor
صراع العروش...التارغاريان
Please be good, please be good, please be good! These past years, nothing has come close to the excitement and anticipation I felt every week preparing for the next episode of GoT on Sundays. I really miss that feeling.
No thank you, not investing my time till it’s a finished product.
The line “When I’m Queen I’ll create a new order” Gave me Daenerys breaking the wheel vibes I’m so excited for this show
As good as it looks, im not expecting much. Considering how got ended
This is exactly the dragon that they used in the hobbit, funny I thought they killed it. #firedragon
What about knight king
I'm seriously excited for this 🤩
Woah is that Justin Long? @1:00  I'll start catching up on game of thrones if #JustinLong is in it
I am ready to get hurt again.
Prince philip riding dragons, this monarchy might mean business here guys
Im not convinced.
Sorry, my trust was lost. I just can't get excited for this.
EPIC!
No one cares
HBO Game of Thrones: GIVE THEM TWO DRAGON SCENES PER SEASON HBO House of the Dragons: DRAGONS DRAGONS AND MORE DRAGONS  HBO, this DOESN'T make up for BUTCHERING Daenery's character ;) We all know she was the most interesting part of Game of Thrones, hence this prequel.
Hbo gave me back Nathan Fielder I will give them a shot with this. Nothing will ever capture the feel of those first 5 seasons of GoT tho
2:29 updated dragon...
demon will be better than bad jon snow horrible arya
too much diversity /vomit
Oh So it's Succession with Dragons.. that's great I'm in
Boring
Is it more woke crap that i wont be watching?
Oh my! That is a dope looking dragon
ENTRA NA MINHA CASA ENTRA NA MINHA VIDA
Looks awesome! Even awesome enough to get excited about after D&D betrayed us all with that steaming pile of ..... that was the end of Game of Thrones.
Excited already
The dragons look amazing!!!! THIS is the story I’ve been waiting to see!
Say Iron Throne again
They might have a dragon, but the doctor has a sonic screwdriver!
This reminds me of a show called Game of Thrones 🐺 🦁 🐉 🦌 🐟 🌸
2:18 what’s dat?
Dragon CGI 🤢🤢🤢🤢
Another show about a women and being queen sounds familiar.....
Is this based on a specific RR Martin book, or is it solely an HBO production?
MILO IS GONNA MORB!
What about white walkers ?
This looks soooooo much better then the lotr series on prime. Can't wait🙏🙌
Understanding characters of Dark is easier than to remember characters of GOT!!!! Really!!!
Goosebumps......
The dinosaurs look cool!
Spoiler alert:   They all die at the end.
Excited for this.
please someone gives me the explanation for a rasta Targaryen so that i can watch the show without thinking that its another woke bs
A great kingdom built by fire and built by great house. They had no idea three hundred years later it would be wiped out all including the fire breathing beasts. What a story. Hope there are no unusual surprises.
Black Valyrians make zero sense. They're suppoesed to be the closest bloodline to Targaryens to breed with in the event that the Targaryens have no one to breed with within their family. Which they have done before in the past, and if thats the case, Daenerys should be black
*click on trailer *see Matt Smith "It's Morbin time."
Everything looks fantastic. HBO is really trying their best to please GOT fans after the disappointing last season. Even the haters will watch this, even if now they are saying they won't, and they'll criticize it even though they will know inside that it's so good.
Ok I'm in
Yoooooooooooo!!!!!!
This guy is from Morbius
Kinda hype but also don't wanna expect too much cos might get disappointed
It's such a shame that D&D ruined Game of Thrones. As much as I want to watch this, I can't help but feel let down from what transpired before.
Caraxes is looking fearsome with that long serpentine neck.From all the dragon i have seen so far, Got included,his design is the most spine-chilling ever. It seems Caraxes design has a  resemblance to Asian  dragons and Greek hydra
i hope the script matches the good looks of the show
I'll give it 7 seasons then I'm out.
I am trying not to get emotionally attached to Rhaenrya, and am already failing.
🤔 Those 2 guys aren't pulling the strings in this one are they?
The Dance of Dragons. This is going to be interesting.
How disappointed I am to not see a single scene or word about Cregan Stark or Roderick Dustin. 😔
The music 🔥🔥🔥🔥
0/10 not enough Starbucks.
Why do trailers have trailers before the trailer now?
Iam waiting
🤮
Please don't be better than The Rings Of Power, i would hate to admit it after i watch both TV shows 😭😭😭😭
Actors without any charisma Afro American Targaryen Don’t feel any epic story in this show Is it Game of Thrones or Witcher season 3? It’s look like any generic Netflix fantasy. I would be happy to be wrong but Im think this show will be horrible disappointment
im giving you one more chance. hoping you don't let us down
I could care less about the show, but the Dragons give me quite a rise!
Hopefully they continue the storyline, can't wait to see how it all ends.
Hope this brings glory that boruto GOT lost.
I desperately want to watch it right now.
This..... actually looks kinda good?
Looks more promising than the new lord of the rings show at least.
actually looking not to bad, i am hooked guys ^^
Is that a black Targaryen?
With very high expectations i feared what if house of dragon wouldn't succeed to meet them but till now with every new trailer/teaser it's just taking my expectations just high high n high
Long live Queen Rhaenyra !
0:23 thats prob jaeharys vs stinger! As far as I can remember the only king who represented himself in his trial by combat. What an absolute unit
2:30 Syrax?
Is the story gonna change?
I hope this series won't only focus on The Dance of Dragons.  Because I would really like to see Aegon's Conquest, the Blackfyre Rebellions, and Robert's Rebellion get adapted as well.
The Velvet Underground with it is (Chef kiss) Damn this looks amazing.
I wish that house of dragon don't disappoint us....
I'll be frank... I still have bad taste in my mouth from Season 8 of GOT.   Now, this looks like it's gonna be some Feminist "I am woman hear me roar" bullcrap.  I'm tired of political messaging.  That's why Top Gun was so good.
So basically this is a coming of age story for a young queen who will defy the odds to ride some dragons and claim the iron throne? Hmm I feel like I've seen this before somewhere...
I'm not sure if I'm ready to be hurt again after the Weiss boys botched the two last seasons of GoT just so that they could start on their little Star Wars project sooner.  That being said, I hope this show is done right.
What about daenerys targaryen?
When you already know that the future is trash, it's kinda hard to watch the series.
Bring it!!!! The obsession begins today!
People willing to watch this after the failure of Game of Thrones are the type of people who get a stomach illness from Chipotle and go back.
*I just hope this will be way better than GoT*
Game of Wokes.
Yes, please!
lol. dumb.
Never really supported rhaenyra's claim to the throne, but this show might just change my mind 🥴🥴🍋
Nothing can hype me more than this show in 2022
LETS GOOOOOO
Good GoT is back finally
O my god......this was gonna break all record....
The Jon Snow GOT sequel is one I would like to watch.  This show was very unnecessary.
I'm wet.
Mortal Kombat
just seems meh
The house of Critical race theory
Goosebumps ❤🔥
Wow, this looks amazing!
This looks like some generic medieval BS
Todo hubiera sido bueno si no hubiesen metido ibclusion frozada con los Velaryon y no hubieran colocado a Viserys I con apariencia de borracho de taberna en vez de un personaje con bigote, gordinflón y bonachón.
അപ്പോൾ ഇതിൽ ചെന്നായിന്റെമക്കളൊന്നും ഇല്ലേ 😌❤️❄️
Pure love for HOD
The music at 0:57 is an instrumental cover of SOMETHING, and I can’t for the life of me figure out what!  *Help??*
I see that we can't even make a trailer without THE MESSAGE being injected into it.
Random black guy with white dreads seems so forced lmao. If you wanted black people in the show... cast someone who wasn't supposed to have a defined feature like white hair
you know what so many people liked in got was ?
how are the wigs still this bad after all this time? c'mon now
🤮🤮 Always thought the Targaryens were a beautiful race but not 1,not even just 1 Targaryen is beautiful or atleast okay!!! Why??
La espera me mata
It doesn't matter, folks. They're going to f**k it up at the end.
1:47 dragon looks cartoon
Why is there always a trailer before the trailer. Its so annoying
I’m hooked already!!!
Hopefully it will be true to the GRRM and D&D would have no involvement
looks mid
1:09 this scene is pure genius, here Alicent looks so much like Margaery and then she says "You’re the king", Margaery most efective line to manipulate Joffrey
Already know the ending, right?
This already looks better than the half of game of thrones because we can actually see it
Caraxes Syrax  Vhegar Sunfyre  There will be fire…….and blood
And at some point this show will be running back to back with the Lord of the rings show man we will be eating good can't wait.
LETS GOOOOOOOO
Who even cares anymore about this IP?
WITH FIRE AND BLOOD
Chef....extra crispy please.
The example of D&D how not to write, the fact that this story (unlike the story of GoT) already has an end AND this trailer make it more difficult than ever not to hype. I'm really excited.
Okay. No it is clearer that there are past and present scenes.
Looks way too dark. Where is the color?
Lol that one black dude looks out of place
i can’t wait, but its going to be tough to compete with characters like john snow, the previous queens, the hound and etc. i hope this is written with the same quiality and they aren’t just trying to squeeze more money out of this
Im scared that it might disappoint after 6 yrs
4K trailer please. This was nasty to watch on a TV.
അത്ര പോര
In case this show turns out great, I was here.
A melhor a maior de todas mdssssssssssss
This feels completely different from Game of Thrones and I love that. It feels like a family drama with dragons.
Looks brilliant, I can't wait.  I like how they haven't shown us much of The Black Dread. Looking forward to seeing that behemoth onscreen. He makes Drogon look like a pup.
Ser Cristin Cole looks so good. even though we know he will become a snake
This is woke AF.
♥️🔥♥️♥️🔥♥️🔥♥️🔥♥️🔥♥️🔥😁😁
I hope this series as good. I’m usually skeptical on prequels but hopefully it’s a great prequel like Better Call Saul is to Breaking Bad.
Fire will reign 🔥🔥🔥
It's coming
All aboard the hype train!
Yoooo
I'm going to hope that this soundtrack is in the opening, perfection!!!
algorhytmus
We have Elden Ring at home son.
This trailer has more dragon scenes than entire GOT.
More white people great 👍
Boy, really hammering down that "females can't sit on the irom throne" bit here huh. And this story is also between two female hairs to the thorne. Also, it seems women want power in this joint more than any man in this world, and they call us men power hungry. Lmao  Seriously though, this looks great, but I doubt it will generate the same hype GOT did back in it's day. And after that dumpster fire of an ending season, I really do not think any human with the slightest bit of intelligent brain stem will waste another 10 years of their lives only to be disappointed again. Most will wait for the series to end & if it has a pleasing ending, then they will watch the entire show. But, most people are idiots beyond compare & will waste their miserable lives on this show, AGAIN. Well, not me. I value time above all, and I don't have time to waste on this show.
The most amazing thing about this is how little I care about this series
Looks like a worthy heir to succeed Game of Thrones, well done HBO and team!
these dragons are magnificent, as someone who has followed GOT for years i must say this show has everything to be bigger  💚🔥🖤
Just hope it won't be a disaster like S8 of GoT
All if the dialogue in this trailer sounds like clunky exposition, and much of the actors' deliveries are awful. Cringe levels of dialogue.
rather have a retcon of S8 than this tbh
I wish to see the first conquest. Imagine the largest dragons ever. Balerion, Meraxes and Vhagar on screen.
Reboot season 8 .
I wish I could be excited, but I'm curious at best
The visuals look breathtaking. It reminds me of the style used during S1, only updated.
This is going to end with the prince pulling out his sonic screwdriver and making the throne explode
So far we only clearly see Caraxes and Syrax, two of..17 confirmed dragons? Not even a glimpse of Vhagar yet. This show's gonna be nuts.
GOT series and definitely prequel are the best tv series ever second place is for The witcher
And so the dance begins
Там был черный с белыми волосами, это как понять вообще? Мультикультурализм?
Meh 😕
FIRST!  NO?
Burn them all!
Is Dumb and Dumber directing this? PLEASE say im wrong!
Please Hindi trailer
Winter not gonna come as long as  dragons fire 🔥 rules the throne
I don't know why but the detail of the finger cut on the iron throne gives me satisfaction and makes me actually believe that they really thought of the book fans' reactions,who will probably look into details like that to judge the series, and not only the general fans'
R rated I Miss you
Looks great! But knowing what happens to Daenerys…… still salty.
donde esta mi delicioso?
Wish there was a badass younger version of Olenna Tyrell too. Diana did a tremendous job in GoT.
Can't wait
Here is hoping the last season will make sense!
To be honest, after the disaster of GOT S7 & S8 I've lost all interest in this world. Maybe I'll watch it someday when I've got enough time to spare.
Yall better make up for season 7-8 of GoT. -.- excited.
Wheres toothless?
House of stark  ரசிகர்கள் சார்பாக  வெற்றியடைய வாழ்த்துக்கள்  #from #south india 🇮🇳🙌🏻
1:48 😵‍💫😳
Who's excited for balerion the dread
Don't tell me that this is another woke garbage. Dance of Dragons is not about women's rights.
Jesus loves you he died on the cross for your sins. Believe in him and you will be saved and go to heaven!
Please have all the fight sequences on the darkest nights. It will be a delight.
So sickened of Hollywood media calling Wyverns "dragons" 😩
'the heatwave is coming'
0:14 someone agree with me that “AN” doesn’t go before a “H”
Unfortunately not diverse enough still see a lot of white people.
There haven't yet been created words to describe this.
Please keep real world politics out of this show just the show and as it is written
Tyrells?
Thats how its done, Amazon.
I wish there's a clip of balerion soaring to the skies
Love the variation between the dragons, they look EPIC
I am full of adrenaline!! I want to watch it now!
Nice my new favourite character Rastafari Targaryen
The hypeeeeeee 😭🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Now let me get this straight: no woman can sit in the Iron Throne? I don’t think this trailer said that often enough.
Not bad, not bad.
I'm for inclusion but forced?!  I understand that targaryens are white🤔
A Targaryan woman trying to sit on the Iron throne..... feel like I've seen this somewhere. Looking forward to seeing this show, I just hope they have things in mind to surprise us and not rehash too much of Daenarys is gonna face later on
Filthy hobbitses
I hope this is good. It's not the dragons that made the series great in the first couple of seasons.
All dead.
I’m sorry, but black people look so ridiculous is medieval european style garb. It’d be like watching a bunch of white people in Bantu knots and African loincloths. The showrunner said he didn’t “want to make a show about a bunch of white people”. In that case, he should have adapted some other story, instead of the one inspired by MEDIEVAL EUROPE
The North remembers. We must stay focused brothers&sisters. Dont forget season 8. Dont forget where this is going.  And also, nowadays movies and series consider it more important to adress our real world political cr*ap (representation, d*versity etc) Rather  then making a good FICTIONAL SHOW LOL So we probably get only good scene in trailer, and story is cr*p.
If only they knew how this story would develop centuries later they wouldn't even bother having any of their wars or intrigues...it's not worth it
All the cry baby fans have come crawling back. Love it.
zzzzzzzzzzzzz
Wow, velvet underground music. Delicate choice..👌
Goodness😍😍
Finally there is some competition for GOT...
We wuz nobles n shiiiiiet
One of the wisest choice viserys could’ve made was make DAEMON king, it would prevented the whole conflict, any other route was guaranteed war
Should I watch game of thrones?
Too much about the iron throne. I'm bored already.
So they changed the throne ascension from siblings in the book to daughter and uncle
#pjexplained #comicverse what are you guys doing???????....this is going to be a disaster..
I never watch Game of Thrones before but I may just have to watch this looks really incredible
Hopefully, the plot won't just be "strong women" taking over the throne while having to stop all the male successors from taking that away from her. Too many shows have been entirely dependent on that for a plot line and it didn't work for Star Wars, doesn't appear to be working for Lord of the Rings, and I sincerely doubt it will work here. I'm all for female protags just so long as they aren't reminding me every other scene how strong they are and how they don't need to prove anything to a man. It gets annoying after a while.
Is that Venus in Furs playing???
Let’s goooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!
Whaaaaaaat!!!!!? I am so amped to watch it!!!!!!
Looking forward to everyone getting called a bigot when this flops
But why should we trust you all with our time after what was done in the final season
that show i think it will beat the crap out of the rings of power,  and im a huge fan of tolkien
I can't be the only one who thinks this looks terrible
Matt smith looking so natural and his acting skills are awesome…. Loved the trailer
These dragon designs are fantastic, and they'll get more screen time than the ones from Game of Thrones. I can't wait to see them in action in this show!!
Actually looks dope. Hope restored?!?!?!
Is the last dragon Vhagar?
Nice Velvet Underground remix there. Shiny shiny, shiny boots of leather
Literally sooooooo good! I’m stoked
this is gonna be bad
Aemond one eye!!!
amazing
First comment here.  GOT LOVER
Looking forward to this, progressive woke tv is best tv.
Woooaaaah! Thats gonna be a good one for sure
Nnnnoooo why did the changed the dragon design??? The original design was perfect 😩😫😭😤
Still made the dragons look like wyverns.  Looks dumb and woke.
God I hate prequels, go forward. Star trek, Star Wars, GOT,etc.
My question is how much incest will be going on I'm not into that
When for Canada Québec?
I thought HBO just announced, they're cancelling the show
The trailer was good , but i wish to see more of the white walkers and their past in this one , or in it's future season atleast.
winter is coming ❤️
Can’t wait to see it!
So Daemon is taking the place of Aegon II?
still waiting for love and death trailer
It would be nice if the gender dynamics and politics of this aren't a one dimensional contemporary meditation on Gender Studies 101.
All of this and at last all we got a mad queen.....when present is ruined who cares about their past.
Looks promising and GRRM is more directly dealing with this one.
I am not as excited as I should be 😂😂 good luck
I wish the show will bring us of what happened after the dance of dragons, such as the hour of the wolf and coronation of aegon III
WHJEWWWWW WE WILL BE WATCHING
The bots on this thread are absolutely hysterical. Does HBO really think they're fooling anyone?
Okay, Now this is trailer I wanted and needed to see. Finally got my attention.
Just mark the accent in the dialogue, it exactly sounds like the ones in Game of Thrones! 🔥
I'm asking myself "Should I invest years of my life to a series that has already totally screwed me over after the last seadon of GOT?" I doubt it very seriously. I'll wait to see how the whole series plays out. I'm still not over how HORRIBLE the last season of GOT was.
Won't be fooled again
get bent.
oh my God, this looks incredible!
Oooh my godness 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🩸🔥
'Knives will come out' - I understood that reference
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Tears of joy!!!! 👏👏👏
Will balerion be shown in the series?
IT SEEMS THEY MADE IT TO LAST ONLY FOR ONE SEASON.
Did they change the way the iron throne looked it looked like it was in the books high with swords for stairs ?
*sus*
Great now I have to keep paying for HBO Max 😂😂😂
HOOOO-LEEEEEE-SHEEEEEET!!!
After they screwed up GOT so bad, why would I watch this
In the end disappoints everyone!!
0:59 Was that Ben Barnes?
Looks like Season 9 of GoT
Holy exited !
Won't be any good if it doesn't have Tyrion!
We sat through 8 seasons of humans, now we just want to see people riding dragons please.
not sure why, but the dragon look soooo "gummybear" fake, in some way a strep down it seems!
Damn it no one cares about the stupid iron throne! Give us a story and characters doing something else
Meh
Y'all really gonna watch this? After what they did
H Y P E
the comment section feels like its full of BOTS..lol...such generic comments...
AA big reason i'm watching this is for the dragons so I hope we get more dragon scenes than in Game of Thrones. They look gorgeous
There is Matt Smith,there are dragons... I'm in!
It's going to be a crashing bore...
I don't like how they made so that the king changes his mind and makes his daughter his heir on a whim. In the books his daughter was always his choice. This is supposed to be the events that lead up to the dance of dragons right?
The music is stellar
Every naysayer still whining about season 8 will be watching.
too bad they didn't have the money they used for this available a couple of years ago. could have used it to finish the original series.
"When I am queen, I will create a new order". Does that sound familiar?
everything looks great and I hope to see some real fight between dragons
**Season 8 flashbacks**
The Visuals are mindowing. I am all sold for this!
Excited and looking forward to this show. It is going to be another blockbuster.
Nobody is going to say anything about the pixelation?
Surprise I didn't see any transgenders
‏عظيم و فخم 🤩😍🤩🔥
Still not watching. Re-Release Season 8. Meanwhile, i will wait for Jon Snow spin-off.
many dragons many cgi, many wows!
Desperately need this series to have as many seasons as possible. It looks so good. Giving me the vibes of 1st season of GOT. But please do Not rush this as well for God sake.
Cant wait 🥺
Black Velarion..... Black Vallirians.... Nice... Next please
Looks great, just like the initial Game of Thrones did. Wonder how long that will last :)
"Dark Sister was made for nobler tasks than slaughtering sheep. She has a thirst for blood."  Can. Not. Wait.
Hahahaahahaha
Just say.... Beatiful .
I am liking this.   Based on what I've seen so far, I think that Emma D'Arcy, is going to steal the show.   Dare I say, "Emma D'Arcy has just received,  House of the Dragons first Emmy nomination?"   LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  But, we'll see, in a few more weeks.
i cant clearly tell if that is vhagar at the end because the shot matches the shot at 1:48 with the person at night time (nearly dawn) which makes me think it could be when Aemond tames Vhagar. and the dragon at the end had bronze scales and bright green eyes which matches descriptions of Vhagar made by GRRM
Daemon Targaryen I can already tell is going to be my favorite character
MEH!
Can't explain my excitement
is  there enough gay .trans,black in this series or white peoples are lagging to represent other race!
HBO is like - What the frig are we going to do with this warehouse full of props we spent millions on?
does anyone actually care about house of dragon after game of thrones season 8 dumpster fire.
No Blood and Cheese? No Mushroom?
😱🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Is it just me, or does the dagger at 2:20 look like Arya's Catspaw dagger? It's got the shape right, seems to have a dragon bone handle, and a red stone in the middle. Catspaw was valyrian steel last I checked (I havent watched it in a while so I could be wrong). If it is though, it's a cool little detail! I wonder if they just made lots of blades like this or if this is Arya's specifically
No. Once bitten twice shy as they say.
DONT DROP TRAILERS DROP THE GOD DAMN SHOW
You cheated on us once and can't be trusted not to do it again.
Seeing my fellow Black people with blond hair is always hilarious.  🤦🏾‍♂️
and here i am wishing that somehow from somewhere danaerys appears on the screen! oh the unfairness of GoT's last season!
Hype!!
Every single hair on my stand up. This is going to be a fantastic birthday present 😭😭😭😭
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA EL HYPEEEEEEEEEEEE
On reddit there is a post with a lot of people complaining that they made black targaryen's. And like really complaining
Woke trash....next...
Looks great!
Also I’m just not interested in seeing more dragons being killed or ppl from dannys line being evil then overthrown like I’m pretty sure we know what happens already
You screwed up Season 8 of GOT BIG TIME... please do better with this, because it looks very promising!
OP!!
Too much women in there...
why they gotta write this girls character as dany lite?? i hope im wrong!!
Que sdd eu tava da minha ex
Just don't stretch it too much and wrap within 2-3 seasons please 🙏🏼🙏🏼
Rhaenyra Targaryen will be killed by her brother's dragon. Unfortunately, It mentioned in Game Of Thrones..
Wow this trailer gave me chills. You've no idea how ready I am 🥺
bad choice of background music hbo, everything else great but it doesn't inspire me to watch it numerous times just because of the distracting music, why wouldn't you put something from ramin djawadi in there.
We will be seated
This is going to be much better than Jon Boring Snow, I have no doubt!
I didn't watch 1 episode from the original, don't plan on watching this. Does not look good
I wonder why they are even fighting to get to sit on the iron throne, it looks as uncomfortable AF
They killed my interest so hard with the last season of GoT, that i won't be even mildly interested in anything GoT related ever again 😂😂
This is looks like a hot mess, stale characters and poor acting saying the same things over and over just in 3mins. The story is already boring and should have done something different but that would require originality which is what Hollywood lacks these days...
Rings of Power now has a very compelling competition, isnt it in trouble here. House of Dragons indeed means business. 😅
Now this looks promising. Dracrys.
Can't even watch this without feeling heartbroken about the last seasons of game of thrones. What a tragedy.
I see a little diversity, but not annoying levels of diversity. It's a white story about literal albinos and that's ok.
Soooooo excited 🖤💣
1:47 is that a Balerion flashback? Or am I just hoping lmao
Meh
I'll watch it after I've read winds of winter.
I’m super gay for this
1:48 That leg though Can't imagine the full size of it.😮😮
HBO Not Available in India 😂
How can they make the dragons look great but the swards look floppy and fake?
I refuse. It's going to be terrible. Go woke go broke. No thank you.
Ok, holy f'in sh3t... NETFLIX.. here, learn something! I saw just trailer, and I already know they followed source material, and that is why it looks EPIC!!!!
i was very sceptical about this show since the finale of got left me with a bad taste in my mouth. But this gave me goosebumps
WHEN I AM *QUEEN* , I WILL CREATE A NEW *ORDER* .  Reminds me of someone I used to be a fan of. Chillssss......literal chills
BGM🔥
Dragons, instead of dialog
we need jon snow to fall through a time portal and end up here
❤️‍🔥🔥
Looks great.....it might challenge best shows in the world.
I hope we get in hindi too
Amazing
Maybe they should have done a sequel about where dannys body gets taken probably to be revived somehow
Couldn't see the episodes at the end pf the original series and can't make out half the dialogue in the trailer for the one. Ugh
Lol oh ..strong female chatacters?.. are the soy boy anti-SJWs gonna cry "Woke" again?.. Can't wait for this show!!!
All the dragons roar as one. The #HOTD trailer has arrived.
Badiya
1:48 that leg looks big🙄  which one?
1:33 Rhaenyra: When I am queen, I will create a new order.  Me: Oh my sweet summer child.
Espero que esta vez no arruinen todo al final!
also available in DISNEY+HOTSTAR IN INDIA 21 AUGUST
Oh, if only they spent this time, effort and money to give GoT the time to finish properly...
I thought they were gonna redo the iron throne
Oh my God it's here! I love it! Can't wait that last month :O
Absolutely bland cast and overdramatic scenes... Looks like they picked up right where the GoT S8 ended... In suckage.
hate to say it but i'm hype... let's hope it lives up to that hype
One advantage this has over GoT is that it actually HAS a complete story – beginning, middle, AND end – and not some rushed together hack job where all the smart characters get turned into complete idiots, all the female characters get stripped of their humanity, the overarching existential threat gets "droid control ship"ed by someone not even involved with that plot thread, and the final theme becomes the showrunners patting themselves on the back as they rush out the door because they're gonna get to do the next Star Wars. The "Dance of the Dragons" also has a tighter focus, geographically; no Night's Watch, no Dorne, no Iron Islands, no Meereen, no Dothraki, etc. If they stick to the story, you won't see much of the Starks or the Lannisters, either; the main houses involved are the Targaryens, Hightowers, Velaryons, and Strongs, with a few others here and there. But you WILL see a lot of DRAGONS! :)
incestual albinos meh
The content of the trailer was good , but the blackouts in the trailer were annoying
I'll wait until mid season to see how it goes. Fool me once George...
Amazing!!!👏👏👏
Hate to say it, but I’m going to …. I’m excited.
Glad we're getting some redemption! And the story of the Targaryan's is one of the most interesting, most violent in fiction. I'm so excited!
the story about the queen who never was I CANT WAIT TO WATCH THIS
I came there just to see giant flying lizards destroying everything, don't you?
El tema de que las mujeres no pueden gobernar y que siempre tiene que venir una vieja a poner orden y luchar contra el patriarcado ya da flojera enserio
i relate so much with rhae being 1stborn and a woman
after the dumpster fire ending of game of thrones i would never watch anything about this show again.
We shall see how this plays out. Hoping for the best🤞🤞
-i have decided to name new heir -what heir
Game of Thrones went off the rails after they ran out of source material. Because there is actual source material for this, I'm actually cautiously optimistic.
i was hesitant after the end of GOT, but this does look pretty good gotta admit
After the disappointment of s8, im going in with low expectations, but I hope it's good
1:47 I’m curious as to who this dragon is. My first thought was that it’s just a close up of one the dragons we’ve seen so far, my second thought was that it might be balerion(tho idk when he died). So idk.
Que coisa linda!!!
The hype has increased!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
HOLY CRAP!! CARAXES LOOKS FIREEEE, and hes got dragon armor?! SWEET i'm so hyped! this looks a hundred times better than i ever imagined!!!!!
No ty. I will not watch a show where the creator said in the latest interview that he had to replace some of the main cast with black people because he hates watching a bunch of white people at screen although they are white in the books
Shame the UK won't get HBO max until 2024...
Please please Hindi
🥰🥰🥰🥰
I can’t see this succeeding with Woke written all over it lol . Hopefully HBO can learn it’s lesson the second time 😂.
Saddest part of house of the dragon - we will not seeing Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister in this series.
Looks fuckung amazing cant wait!!
Love seeing King's Landing and Dragonstone again! I finally finished up Game of Thrones at the start of this year, so I'm pumped for more content!
Will this series available in hindi or not
Have to watch this trailer a 100 more times before the show releases. ❣💫🐉 Absolutely insane, one of THE best trailers I have seen and heard.
Fire and blood!
Dropping it early so it doesn't compete with the Rings of Power trailer at SDCC? Smart move 😂.
Best trailer ever 🤩👌🔥
This looks so bad lol
We are ready for you House Of Dragons. Indeed the stacks will be very high and the plot compelling beyond measure !!!💪 😎
Espectacular!!!
After this, can HBO make one series on Maegor The First and his six wives, aka the Henry VIII of Westeros, as well as a series on the last days of Valyria??
This is beautiful!
I can't wait, im on fire 🔥
looks terrible
GOOSEBUMPS, feels like coming home 👌🏼
More race swap bs
In a month House of the Dragon will be here. I believe the season will start with the great council on Harrenhall which Viserys I Targaryen was announced the heir of the Iron Throne and will end with the black council and green council go to war known as the Dance of the Dragons. All the characters and dragons look awesome. I believe and hope that will be even better than Game of Thrones. Fire will reign. 🔥👑🐉🏰⚔️🛡️🐺🦁🦌🖤💚
I’m confused, what does this have to do with the forging of the rings?? SMH looks like a quick money grab, not even staying true to the source material!! C.S Lewis would be spinning in his grave!
After Game Of Thrones Season 8, I'm not even going to give this a chance, sorry
This looks incredible. IM so exited.
HBO, what did you do? This looks so terrible!
I want the song!!
You guys blew season 8... Still disappointed about that by the way ...
Let's gooo!!! HOD is definitely gonna be fire 🔥🔥🔥
"when I'm queen I will create a new order"  Daenerys moment right here
Black Targaryans lol
How targaryen can be black?
Let's gooo
Doctor who is in this what
Some Targaryens don't look so Targaryen to me...
After GOT Season 8... I want to feel excited but having serious doubts
I’m shocked… everything looks breathtaking! I got high expectations and the moment I heard GRRM was one of the producers I stuck to the hope that the series will absolutely do justice to the book and after this trailer I know it will. House of the Dragon will break records. Can’t wait for the dialogue especially the ones with Prince Daemon and Aemond 🤭. My favorite House is almost here ❤️❤️❤️🐉
GOT S8 redeemed in less than 3 minutes. Love the cinematography by the way. 🔥
ديييييييييييييييييييييييييييييييييييييم  I Can’t Waited 👌🏻
So after it comes out we have to wait weekly for new episodes, that’s the worst kind of torture!
I don’t know if it’s too late for this sort of GOT spin off to work. I’m sure it’ll be amazing in many ways, but after the disaster that was the ending of GOT my attention is just not there.
I hope this isn't just going to be a cheap rehash, with constant allusions to Daenerys and GOT.
I don't care who dies as a human It's the Dragons that die that will hurt the most
So, which characters are going to turn out to be stupid, or evil, or both? That's assuming this show is compelling enough to even learn the character's names, which isn't a given
CARAXES HAS ARMOR!!!!!
#renewraisedbywolves
out standing......................................... 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Oh I can’t wait!!!!!
Good lord, did i just watch the whole season in 2:30 seconds?
A Targaryen family war with dragons? yes please!
Venus In Furs by The Velvet Underground & Nico :O
Please HBO bring this to India
i have read the book and to be honest the story are better than game of thrones
Brightness
0.55 the city watch cheering for deamon their former capitan and lord commander.  2.04 ser Criston Cole vs Aemond
Y’all recognize that dagger???
I dunno ,, GOT took a major dump at the end,,,,
Nothing but a cash grab milking the popularity of GOT. No thanks
The last few seasons of Game of Thrones really soured the world for me. Hard to be excited about this show when GoT wasn't given proper time
this better be good HBO or I'm bombing your headquarters
Looks boring in an expensive way.
SOOO Psyched
Please release this in India also
I hope the opening theme is as good as Game of Thrones.
One house to rule them all.
Quickly
This proyect is going to be the next promise of the century!! OMG HBO Max😍
I want that GOT intro track tbh
Love it but I hope there’s a more magical element to it. I love the dragons but I need more!
Dreams doesn't make us king Dragons did
HBO never dissapoints  long live G.O.T
This will be a flop show
Pls be a great success ... So that this type of spin off comes often and it might be possible one day that GoT s7 and s8 can be made again ... S7 and S8 just make a great series like GoT a one time watch series
My Hype has stopped, need to watch the real deal once released to juge
We have to wait for Each Episode for Each Week,That Sucks But Curiosity Makes Feels Happy in the End
WE WUZ BLONDE AND SHIEET
Hmm you see that this could’ve been potential of last season of GOT but they rushed it.
What's the thing Viserys puts on the table at 00:38? Looks like an eye or something :D
Considering how poorly received the last couple of seasons of the origina GOT were (which is evidenced by the fact that over a global pandemic, there were just no pop-culture references to the show - not even a 'winter is coming!' or the idea of keeping white walkers at bay when all the airports were closed), I'm curious as to whether this will have much 'good-will' in general. I suspect that as soon as ratings dip a tiny bit, they'll pull the plug
This really feels like the ASOIAF books and mythos truly come to life, House of the Dragon really has the potential to be the best show of 2022
They Dracarys'ed the Thrones out of this trailer. Omfg, wow!
OMG
Daenerys Targaryen will always be my favorite
U stole Master Mirror song from Witcher 3.
After what you did in Season 8 of Game of Thrones, I'm not very excited about this series .  Note :  I know that the events of this series are long before Game of Thrones .
1:48 this leg looks gigantic.... It could be Balerion
Ya quiero  ver la batalla entre dragones, no como en la octava temporada de juegos de tronos durante la batalla en invernalia  que no se veía nada 😒
Awesome!!
I'm not anticipating this show at all, but juts like GOT I'm sure there will be characters I'll love and hate...and deaths that will break my heart and make me happy.
Is this a limited time series or will it be a full series like GOT?
I’m here for this god please don’t take before this starts
First season maybe will be good but final season will be?
This looks epic
Holy mother of god i am waiting ❤️❤️❤️❤️
*Black Targaryen? What's his name, "Khang KFC Chicken Dawg"?*
This trailer really looks and FEELS like the traditional Game of Thrones, so I am way more optimistic now than I ever have been that this show will be good. However... a trailer is only a trailer... The budget and quality are something that is more or less expected at this point, but if the writing is as bad as it was in Seasons 7/8, even the best cinematography in the world won't compensate for a lack of depth.  And in fairness, if HBO wants to cash in on the Marvel/Disney style of surface-level entertainment, I'm fine with that, but a lot fans fell in love with GoT because of the incredible writing and narrative quality of the earlier seasons. I'm really hoping they have found a balance that all fans can appreciate, and not just a bunch eye-candy with derivative storytelling.
They say dragon?? I’m watching
🇩🇿🇩🇿🇩🇿🇩🇿المملكة العاشورية
I looks great, but I HATE pequels... I really hate them.  Gonna watch it anyway, but i would prefer original story with dragons or dinos or something...
Will this be on HBO or just HBO max?
So i looked for info on Vhagar and she is described as being Bronze with Green eyes. Thats definitely her 2:30
I'm loving this but it needs more people shouting at dragons.
Should have waited 10 more years after that last season...
lookslikesshit™
Already not feeling this one 😕
This looks shithouse
As long as its not like Season 8 of GOT..
I sleep
This….looks pretty good. Can’t lie
The fire will reign 🔥
What's the relation between this and the original GoT?
I would say this can’t be any worse that GOT season 8, but that wouldn’t be saying much. This looks lame
Except music everything is great... badly missing GoT epic theme music 😍😍
Lotr vs house of the dragon,which one?
VENEZUELA 🇻🇪
Them dread them cheesy them velaryon them white
This makes the amazon LOTR series look like a joke. So excited!
The Battle scene looks amazing! Missed GOT battle scenes so much. Matt looks perfect for this role! Milly is nailing young Rhaenyra. Omg love it.
This and Rings of Power have so much potential, hopefully it will be good
Hey @HBO Max I am from India how can I watch HBO shows like this one
It Will be a blockbuster series
I'm too old for all this whispering!  LOL
The thing is... Is the last dragon vhagar??????
Let’s go!!🔥🔥
Oh my goodness 😭😭😭
🤞🏼 Please dont be woke, please dont be woke, please dont be woke, please dont be woke, please dont be woke 🤞🏼
So is this storyline in the books all about a woman advancing to the throne and how the men of the realm don’t want that or is this trailer just highlighting that part heavily?
Its Gamin Time!
Who do you think the last dragon is? I have a dragon on my mind, but I wanna see if others agree with me or not..
This looks so good
Green vs Black, Queen vs King, Dragons vs Dragons. More excited than I thought I would be for this.
Lets go.
Outstanding...Can't wait to see it
Please be good that's all I hope for
I have goosebumps. I expect a lot from the show. Let's hope that the House of the Dragon will not disappoint us.
woooo arte q emocion volver a ver esta serie sin palabras
Is Vhagar going to be part of the show? If I remenber correctly  Visenya's dragon fought in the Dance of the Dragons
Last dragon? Vhagar?
I bet this prequel leads to an exciting story with a really satisfying ending. Otherwise why would I watch it
My lord, how much money did you pump into this ?
Is it working? Ate they gobbling it up? Yes they are! Que up the vars again for game of thrones night!     And then we send in the shooters.
Gurls... get.... it.... DONE
Start at 0:05 to skip the spoiler BS.
Can't wait for a character to do a complete 180 that comes out of nowhere.
It doesn't look like we've seen Vhagar yet. I'm pretty excited to see her since she should be like 300 years old at this point in the story.
This looks amazing! The cast, costume designs, the filming locations, digital effects and built sets. It will be astonishing to see this unseen Legendary Targaryen tale come to life. However the only major problem I have with all of this as a whole is that we all know the terrible awful ending of this story, The Dance of Dragons. And the ending to their only remaining hope to continue on the family line, Daenerys Targaryen. All of it ended terribly and it was all for nothing. What is the point to see how powerful they were and only to see it all fall to the bitter end?  ((Spoilers ahead!!! Read at your own risk!!)) Yes there still is Jon Snow but he will never be what the other Targaryens were. Jon is a Stark through and through being raised in the north. Daenerys was the last true member of House Targaryen and they are no more. Thanks for uploading.
Yawn!!
CGI filler to get appeal to the marvel generation. The first season of GOT was single room sets, real locations and didn’t require thousands of extras. But we loved it for it’s good writing and dedication to good story telling. This will go down like a lead balloon.
Bad CGi dragon
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
this is so good, totally hyped can't say the same for the new LOTR series tho
I’m skeptical 🤨 but I’ll give it a watch.
Any Mallus 👀
TA MUITO FODAAAAAAAAAAA CARALHOOOO 😍😍🔥❤️
CANT WAIT TO SEE SUNFYRE
Peak tv =HBO. A worthy successor to the greatest show of all time.🔥🔥🔥
🫢🫢🫢🫢🫣 OH MY
Monee Epic 🔥
There is no words in Old Ghiscari, High Valyrian or Dothraki than can describe my exhilaration!
7/10 needs more Dragon
Can't wait to see these dragons!
Oh boy...this looks much better than I expected
So LOTR is trying to be GoT and GoT is trying to be LOTR.  NICE...
Is this the story how they killed all black Valyrians. Or is that in later season's
BGM 🙌
HBO PLEASE DONT FAIL US ON THE ENDING!!! I have high hopes this will outdo the first game of thrones.
As long as there is gratuitous violence and a lot of unnecessary nudity, or it really isn't GOT material.
It actually looks like they are getting some real damage control done after season 8 of GOT and getting back on track. Perfect timing as well, since amazon is butchering the legacy of Tolkien, we have this to look forward to.
I got trust issues! The way they fumble the last 2 seasons of game of thrones  got my iffy. The dragons look amazing but I don't know I feel like they rushed the last series final so they making up with this. Im looking at the comments n its dragons, dragons, dragons ummmm I care more about the storyline 😕
If this is a success I would love to see a spin off telling the story of the white walkers, that would be awesome.
Show me Mushroom!
Really hoping this show will be GOT except on steroids
GoT is back baby 😍🥰
that end shot of the dragon wakes me up for the series galvanic it is
LOL!!
Looks INCREDIBLE HBO! And hopefully sticks to the canon a lot more than the second half of GoT.
The show of the year
1:48 looks like it could be balerion that dragon looks massive.
Ansioso demais para a temporada! Produção impecável!
Bring back Infinity Train and Close Enough HBO. Two amazing animated shows which didn’t deserve to be canceled.
Its so freaking weird looking at them all blonde but lacks of charisma unlike witcher.
კამფეტ
Can't wait for it!!!! 😣😣😣
This feels like falling in love again with someone from your ex’s family after a very brutal sad break up with your ex❤️‍🔥#GOTS8 🪦
OMG 😍😍😍That will be freaking Awesome! That trailer is incredibly good & intense!🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻♥️♥️♥️♥️Wow!🙋🏼‍♀️🇨🇦
Looks like strong independent wamen and Targaryens of color... So inclusive!
Omg the dragons! I'm Gunna pass out!
See Amazon. That´s a trailer
Leave it to HBO for making an epic fantasy actually feel EPIC.      *side glance* Rings of Power *smh*
FINALLY WE SEE AEMOND!!!
Well done 🙌🏻 hats down!! What a dream come true
I’m in as long as the D&D brothers stay FAR away from this one.
I've just go one word for this - DRAGONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I donno... Part of the appeal of GoT was mystery and since this is a prequel we pretty much know all that's gonna to happen. I think I'm gonna pass on that.  Much more interested in Jon Snow spinoff tbh
Looks incredible, and only 1 month left to go!!😍
war is a foot...that steps on a lego in the middle of the night.
It will be Lords of the Rings: The Rings of Power vs Game of Thrones: House of the Dragon. Which of them will come up on top?
Sheeesh
Firee will reign lovee 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🤯
This LOOKS pretty epic I must admit ! Emphasis on looks!  ESPECIALLY the dragons etc, but we shall see, we shall seeee😁🤙
As long as d and d don't touch this and any other spin off and hopefully sticks and maybe ad a bit to the source material this could rival the first 4 seasons
This is kinda like Game of Thrones
Oh, how I love these crazy blondes! 🔥🔥🔥
Aemond One Eye on the loose!
yeah, looks like a feminist story.
This is absolutely thrilling to watch. Totally powerful performance of all the characters.
:0
Looks interesting
Probably not
All Hell's gonna break loose on August 21st.....
Ooooooohhh Aemon one eye is crazy. So many Targaryens in this story. The split kingsguard will make for a great story line. I can't wait to see how far they actually go into the real lore. With the dragon pit. The valaryian bastards and all the dragons. Sheepsteeler has the best name for sure
I like how they still can't get the throne right
You are not fooling me for second time you scrubs. Im not falling again after what you did with GOT
I'm a simpleton, I see GoT and i click like...xD!
I'm gonna pretend.... Dani is the queen of the iron throne...and now this trailer looks hella more promising
“Madness and greatness are two sides of the same coin. Every time a new Targaryen is born, the gods toss the coin in the air and the world holds its breath to see how it will land.”
Give us more just like this HBO. I hope your rethinking cancelation and bring them all back. PLEASE
Omggggg
I like everything here, but they need to grow Caraxes up until he fights...
I have zero confidence in the writing on these big budget projects. The entire plot has to be passed through the lens of "the message" and it ends up diluting everything.
Now i dont want to die before finish this series.
dude this trailer is awosome ... loved it... eagerly waiting for this series!!
Shiny, shiny, shiny boots of leather Whiplash girl child in the dark Comes in bells, your servant, don't forsake him Strike, dear mistress, and cure his heart
I miss the original GOT opening music.
Que incrível!!! 🔥♥️
I drink and i know things
I loved the look of Daenerys’ dragons. Going to stay positive, but some of these dragons are bumming me out.
I’m so looking forward to seeing Daemon & Rhaenyra fight the Hightowers. Who is more worthy of the Irone Throne?
Hope it’s better then the Final Season of GoT
I'm just so happy to see dragons again bro 😭
hopefully corlys being not white is as woke as this gets. still will give it a chance
Nope
Man‼️I am SOOO pumping with energy‼️
trailers these days: _coming up next, in a few moments after this coming up next thing, which you're so checked out with a low attention span, you'll forget to call it out by the time it's finished_ ...
This is everything and more. Thanks HBO!
Am so pumped for this😱....they do this right I forget Got sn8 happened lol
This is gonna be so much more ok than the Amazon LOTR. There's even a chance it could be good! Loving the smokey light this thing is bathed in.

House of the Wyvern
What in the Smaug
THE CONQUEROR!!!
A even more Excited of this show and what come next of Westeros
looks amazing, so glad D & D had nothing to do with this new series or the John Snow sequel series. Hopefully these series will lift the tarnish and bad taste left from the end of the OG series left.
A little blunt. Not hyped. I hope we get au understanding and know other houses besides targaryen.  Game of thrones is about politics and strategy between houses. Not sopa drama within one.
When I am Queen I will kill a lot of people haha, be honest Rhae.
Black dude with bleached dreadlocks playing Targarien family member… thats all what u need to know about this show.
Hahaha. "Hey guys we fixed season 8 by adding in more modern day feminism"  dead franchise
If Dany's dragons had on the same armor as Ceraxes they might've survived longer
looks so much more respectful to the  books and the world Martin created
I'm confused. When does this take place?
seems so good I don't want to watch it because I'm scared after the failure of GoT season 7 and 8
y'all got some making up to do...
This looks so good... I got chills and was reminded of those fantastic early GoT seasons... a shame they won't go back a refilm season 8 which is unwatchable and stained the entire franchise experience for most fans (all because the creators got greedy and lazy towards the end).
Just looks like itll be another danaerys sigma grindset show. Worst part of the original got
I simply never found the Targaryans all that interesting. But that's just me.
In 6 seasons of game of thrones we get 12 minutes with the dragons , hope in this one we can get more
Yeah sorry, but Targaryens of color are kind of an immersion and deal breaker.
Matt Smith!
Going to be awesome
Mother of dragon fans like ❤
However awesome and great this show is, it still ends with “I don’t want it” and the garbage that was season 8 and 7.
🐉⚔
Would that happen to be Valerian the dread?
If only they hadn't botched the last season of the original series. I simply cannot give in to enthusiasm for this.
Another prequel, who cares. I know how it ends
Gosh, I sure hope they talk about the Iron Throne in this series...
It feels like it is the same period as GoT they use the same weapons, clothing, cities. Is it not way before GoT ?
Well, now Im sure that this series will beat The Rings Of Power hahaha
Will this be absolute dogsh*t like the last feel seasons of GoT?  Who knows? I certainly won't watch to find out
Looks good. No doubt idiots will find some reason to be hating on it...
Meu Deus...
Ama me mié 😱
Hi
Is it only me or they did make the dragons (Caraxes, Vhagar, and probably Syrax) uglier in HOTD series in comparison to our beloved Drogon, Viserion, and Rhaegal?
HBO HAVING THE BEST SERIES NOWADAYS
#hype
This looks absolutely stunning. Butterfly dreams.
Take a shot everytime someone says IRON THRONE on this trailer
thanks for the potato upload
This looks so good
Lol people hyping this up really? This looks worse than gots8.
corlys velaryon is black?
Epic flashback
House of the Dragon:  “White people are bad!”   Remember that tweet?
Is the dragon at the end  Balation the black dread?
dr. who's unending adventures continue 👍
Yep, I can smell shite...🤣🤣 Not even the dragon looks good. Isn't the same production? Because everything looks odd.
Reading Fire & Blood, I just knew it was ripe for adaptation. Now the time is almost here, and I cannot wait to finally see page put to screen.
the toxic ex returns.....hello Westeros
Looks like it's only me who still has flashbacks from the disastrous ending of GOT?
2:20 Aemond Targaryen ♥️
Nice, waiting for this
The trailer looks pretty good and I hope for a great success as a game of thrones... I love you Arya forever.
that girl though😍
Looks really cool just wished someone else was in other than Oliva cooke.. I personally don't like her acting just my opinion. Going to still watch it obvously.
I'm not sure if it's gonna be any good but looks way better than Amazon's lord of the rings.
OMG OMG OMG... No puedo con esto, ya es cruel. Necesito verla ya mismo!
Hopefully this will be a more natural, more thought out of a series
After the trash final season of GOT, I’m not going to get excited about this. We’ll see.
Im a bit confused. Where is Aegon II? Has he been combined into Daemon or something?
This looks spectacular. But will the writers do a better better job with this series than the last two seasons of Game of Thrones?  This will be HBO's last chance to redeem this entertainment franchise. However bad the writing and dialogue might be, this will definitely be better than Amazon's Rings of Power.
The sound track is awesome
Won't the Night King and the White Walkers appear in this series ????
Hindi mai h kya
Blackaryon is not Velaryon
It’s kind of sad knowing what happens to them in GOT
Oh look a prequell to milk the franchise instead of reshooting seasons 6-8, count me out lol
Hmmm didn't know The Doctor was in this.
Looks good!
Yes, but we know how all it ended >_<
We’re getting closer and closer to the show being released, trailer looks amazing. I have high hopes for house of the dragon!
Imagine having a final season that was SO SO SO BAD that u can't help but think of it when seeing anything GOT related
Gonna love this and waiting for this since I first heard of it.❤️😍🤗
2:31 MORTAL KOMBAT!!!! Oh... wait...
After long time waiting finally 😍
The fact that we can actually SEE the scenes makes this more exciting. Thanks HBO for the clarity of the scenes.
I choose to remain unconvinced. The complete debacle of everything unwritten in the books and beyond will forever scar this story on screen. How can one invest themselves in a story that's still unfinished?? The show ended awfully and GRRM is afraid to finish the books because then he'd kill the golden goose. Waste of time and money to invest in this unfinished product.
🥹🥹🥹
Game of thrones feminist edition.....I'll pass.
This looks so cringe
I didn't look up who wrote the script for this one yet - hoping not Dumb & Dumber.
The new (old) Iron Throne looks absolutely stunning with all the additional swords on the steps and around. ABSOLUTELY STUNNING!
Let's go🔥 🙇🙇
now thats how u do a trailer
Who's responsible for the music? It's beautiful
Finally the series of the year is here🔥🔥 can't wait to watch 👀👀✌️
This looks much better than the LotR trailer.
It's a movie about politics with like, dragons. Let's hope OUR politics is out of it entirely. I won't even watch that other series about, you know, rings.
I'm unsure about this show. On one hand I'm super excited but on the other hand I remember how horribly rush the finale was for GoT, that I'm not sure I want to invest time into this series to be disappointed again by HBO.
Cant wait
Seems promising
It looks so good. I'm excited!
Yes!
Hopefully it's not a flop, excited to see this
As much as I hated season 8, I missed this world/lore/universe/story.   I just wish they fleshed out the night king arc cuz that was the highlight of the whole show (stop these petty house squabbling and unite against a common enemy)
"There's a new Game of Thrones series!" "Okay." "And Benioff and Weiss aren't attached." "WOOOOO!!!"
So I don't know if I can trust HBO to do this justice because of what they did to the final season of GOT. I was so angry with that last season, I stopped my subscription to HBO and have not paid to see anything they have put out since then.
matt smith is the only reason im semi interested.
Ok 🥵
Just mind blowing 💥
forgot this was even coming out.... visually it looks great, but most of the characters just looks so damn.......meh. And the story just seems like GoT all over again....which I understand but still...
1:47 Vhagar
Fire will reign
This looks so good. Please don’t ruin this one too!
I'm literally going out of my mind with excitement, this is the best thing to ever happen ever!!!
I really want this to be good
This looks cheaply made compared to what I expect from HBO. Just another cash grab using someone else's IP. Can any one still playing for HBO MAX let me know why they keep it?
do we need to see game of throne to understand this
OMG noooo!!….why do the dragons look like that! Especially Caraxes!! His neck is like a snake! They’ve ruined them! Nothing like Dragons we know. They don’t look as scary either, they look like they’ve been made to look more child friendly
I just hope all budget didnt go into the cgi dragons and the showrunners kept some aside for a component writing department as well.
The dislikes are from the other houses! Damn them!
🔥🔥🔥
Something I hated from GoT dragons was the lack of differentiation, for me they looked exactly the same and you could barely identify Drogon from Rhaegal, or Viserion from Drogon. In this trailer you can see how each dragon looks unique, something I totally love. Like, Caraxes horn look totally different from Syrax horns. But to be fair, I kind of liked how the dragon from GoT were modeled, for me they looked more fearsome and "natural" than the ones we are seeing here. I don’t know, but the momento I saw Caraxes appear on screen I thought it was Smaug from LoTR 😅. Either way I am super hyped and can’t wait to watch this, because I know it’s going to be amazing 🤩.
Gotta say I'm super impressed of how the dragons are looking.
Let's gooooo 😭🔥🔥🔥🔥
Why is there a black guy with white hair?
Blah blah blah strong woman, Random black man with blonde hair blah blah blah … woman …. YAWN 🥱
I can hardly see any people of color in this trailer!
Why do I get these trash recommendations...pls just stop. Me, my friends and family will NEVER watch any GOT related trash show ever again...As far as we're concerned Mr. Martin who wrote this things or consulted in these shows is a has bin. He should just retire. Go ahead and launch this show coz no one is watching this coz no one wants it anymore....TRASH!
Holy..... 🔥
i wonder who will take the throne?!?!? a male character or a female character??!?!?!?!?!?!? Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
This show should be called How To Train Your Dragon
Aemond Targaryen looks so cool...
Race swapping, interracial couples, ultra feminism. Very woke! Perfect for low brow HBO watchers!
All i want to know is how many episodes will i enjoy before the heartbreak of the season finale
when matt smith and house raceswap are crisps i will tune in.
Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
LOL, nope.  Not even once.
After the way that HBO royally screwed up Season 8 of GOTs, why would I invest my time and money in a new GOT series?
jenny oldstones?
my dopamine levels just skyrocketed
OMG, looks great!!!!
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES
It looks like GOT is again gonna rule the hearts of these decade
The dragons look stellar, excited to see the lengths of this show.
This trailer needs more dragons!
MY GOOOOOOSH!!!! I'M SO EXCITED!!!! THIS IS AMAZING AND TOO BEAUTIFUL!!! CARAXEEEES!! PLEASE DO NOT REPEAT THE SAD OUTCOME OF GOT!! #HouseoftheDragon #FireandBlood
Let’s Go!!!!!!!!!!!! 🔥
Isn't this basically just a rehash of Danny's story?
Refo s7-s8 of GOT into a s9.
I've never been so excited for anything before
WHOA!!!!
"Chaos isn't a pit...Chaos is a ladder!" -Paetyr Baylish
Tell me more about the black Targaryens....total clown show. Even if this is a good show (it won't be), it still leads to season 8.
yawn
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Hope this is as good as GOT series.
Wow. I hate this already.
Unless y'all admit the last season of game of thrones is non canon, I'm not watching this knowing it all leads to bran the broken
Goosebumps... Finally can re feel the missing joy of good got stuff
so here we go......
That's vhagar at the very end , guys!  Bright green eyes (as G.R.R.Martin said it should be)
Well, now I know where Dany gets it from
Ok but these loud "mini trailers"  before the actual trailer is the worst thing about modern film/tv
I hate when trailers be like "THIS IS THE OFFICIAL TRAILER" at the beginning. It ruins suspense, looks immature and desperate, and just ruins the whole vibe tbh.
🥰🥰
Turns out I just dont care
Very woke!
Literal Chills!!
My view seems to conflict with that of most people here. Not only does this show seem highly derivative of Game of Thrones, down to the Daenerys-like heroine (I know it's a prequel, but it should at least be distinguishable from the original), but the musical theme of this trailer sounds awfully like the song Venus in Furs by The Velvet Underground.
Ooooooh God. I do really hope this serie would be great... It's just me or what but the wigs look ugly Anyway I can pass that detail if the story is great... Rhaenys is already my favorite character, that woman looks amazing The queen who never was
Next 8 years waiting for no final
garbage like GOT itself from S5 on
Matt Smith is THE BOSS!
Now this is Hype!
"i am here to inherit the iron throne"
CGI should be better than in GoT but as per trailer it's looks worse.
Does AN suit here 0:16  It sud be A HBO...
Remain to true to source material and this show will break all records
Can someone pls give a breakdown with GOT relevance to this series, much appreciated.
I'm really not into Game of Thrones anymore, but I want to watch this just for the dragons I love dragons...
Wow! Look how much I dont care.
I can't wait for house of Morbius!
Fool me once shame on you. Fool me twice shame on me.
1:27 Critical Drinker's "THE MESSAGE"
I'm confused. Didn't Daemon wed his niece Rhaenyra and isn't the conflict between Rhaenyra and Aegon II?
well time to see how woke and broke this goes too.
yes... so to clarify, you are big on women empowerment here...... and yet you allowed the leading franchise asset to be crapped on in final season, btw the house targaryen character I might add, we saw how the family line ends ffs. you are even liking comments that say i had my doubts but i am in now, you know season 8 ruined it all, so why aint you looking to amend those events, countless ways that can happen. do it !
Legolas walked, so the Targaeryan could fly
why are there black people?
Ok... It just feels so good to see Matt Smith in something again. Super hyped for this!
This looks better than any other running TV show. That HBO quality is awesome
Nice
Lord have mercy on my soul 🔥Fabien ❤️‍🔥👨🏻‍🚒
epic
I shall give this a chance! Don’t fail us! ONWARD!!!!!!
We have our plan that is  TELEGRAM 🔥🔥🔥
It looks great! I was looking forward to hear a new stories and tales from Westeros, hope it will be as good as first 4 (or at least 6) seasons of GOT. Can't wait!
Holy crap this looks incredible. Now is this just gonna be one season or the start of a new series?
❤🔥
Omfg
GOT had top notch visuals and cinematography the whole show even if it didn’t necessarily end well it was filmed with great care now my problem with these trailers is this first why is the logo exactly like The hunger games if you don’t know go look secondly it looks cool but from a filmmaker standpoint it’s super sharp where as in The GOT series they used An Arri Alexa which gave the best skin tones and wasn’t super sharp it looked natural 3rd the music is killing me because music selection is 50% of what Carrie’s a show and just like the New Rings of Power Trailer it doesn’t sound or feel like lord of the rings I feel the same with this trailer it doesn’t feel like GOT  regardless if it is a thousand years earlier keep the feeling which is created through the soundtrack you use and also the choice of camera is pretty sure this was also shot on a RED which does offer amazing results but for this specific Genre of show The Arri would be a better choice so yeah I guess we will just have to see fingers crossed
The dance of the dragons.. The goosebumps are unexplainable. The greatest show ever is now even greater..
Want to love this show but looks redundant g.o.t. was legendary  except  the final season. And too much hype as well
i will wait for this one to finish up the last season then i might start watching
IM READY
Mwaaa i don’t know.. don’t like the rasta knight with blond hear.. just why!?
RIP Rings of Power
Can’t wait to see vheagar
Never Forgive, Never Forget. Let D&D rot. And this show smh
All hail to our new 🔥MOTHER OF DRAGON 🔥
This looks incredible
Isn't that the girl from ready player one?
Great another show just all about how strong waman are
Okay it's good but look alike a fan edit or a homage to a character
Super excited about this new series… no wait, actually I’m not.
No queens ever sit on iron throne.,.But dragons will ..
I lost the words I don't even know what to say about the thriller. But what I know is that you hit harder than Game of Thrones series It's incredible it's grandiose Merci HBO.
Grand💥✨🔥🫡
Well, the story definetly reminds me of Game of Thrones, almost down to a tee.. welp. Lets hope it's different enough to bring GoT's world back to life ig
Can anyone tell me summary of trailer in short
FEELS LIKE WITCHER ANYBODY?
Now this is where the fun begins
i am skeptical but will probably watch 🧐
Spoiler alert: All of them die eventually and the Targaryen Line becomes irrelevant.
This doesn't make any sense
Man i wish i could skip a month and watch the full season like.. right now.....
1:08 I’m assuming that’s Aegon II
What we actually need is the remake of the last 2 seasons
black to portray Corlys Velaryon ? Velaryons have to be pale  blond/silver haired and purple-eyed. Only because of that the Targaryens bred regularly with them
Matt Smith will always be my  doctor
This looks awful.
W dragons
Je dis oui
Böööööööse, junge. Böööööse
Im so hyped, please HBO you gotta deliver... And I believe you will.
:How many times did you watch this? :yes
that dragon looks really bad lmao
**yawwwwwwwwwn...**
Kya fayda jab hindi main aayegi hi nhii
I am here for the Dragons :)
"Jump in the Caac" vibes from the thumbnail
1:55 ”Daemon gave us these cloaks,” he said, “and they're gold no matter how you turn them.”
സംഭവം പൊളിക്കും 🔥
Podoba mie sie to! :D
Ramin doing the music again feel so right❤️ he is king on that
This show will avenge Daenerys storyline in the series !
I'm waiting 🔥♥️
You know, this story is in parts about female empowerment, but it is not rubbed in our face with a brick.
*History does not Remember Blood, it Remembers names*   🔥🔥
dhduehduedheu was that aemon one eyed omggggg
I can't wait to see the first episodes
This looks so damn amazing. Seeing the Dance of the Dragons brought to life is going to be epic. This trailer alone makes me wish and hope for a full length movie of Aegon's Conquest. Please HBO, never stop adapting this great world to the screen. Also, glad to finally see House Velaryon!
Aleluya!
FEELS LIKE WITCHER ANYBODY?
Medium
Seriously a huge respect for everyone involved in house of the 🐉dragon! Can't wait to finally witness my favorite house on screen ❤
Crackas
0:55 kinda sounds like a bardcore version of Mastermind by Deltron 3030
None of these trailers have made me excited about the show. I don't like none of these characters but I'll still give it a shot I guess
Scorched Earth 🔥
Let’s gooooooooooooo
Hopefully no D&D(?) means it’ll be good
My heart is not sure if it’s ready to love again after last time 🫣
Honestly don't compare this to season  8 These are new people taking over and for them it's season 1 ... if anything compare this to season 1 of GOT and you can see a HUGE improvement.... the budget looks out of this world
i am your heir,,,,  love you demon. i think it cross our expectation very much. it's brutal, incredible,full of insanity and caos and emotions
Dragons will be the only interesting thing in this "series". Open helmet, black Targaryen and other 'genius' ideas. Thanks trailers for understanding what smell product awaits us. Peace for all)
We need HBO MAX officially in india...😑😑
It looks like another NETFLIX flop, not an HBO series.
Who want to bet that the black dude name is Token?
31 çekiyorum şu an çok iyi
The cities look like completly made of CGI, they didnt use real locations now?
The era of dragons
Dracaeyse
Ehhhhhhhh.
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
the dragons are beautiful
I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT
Drink everytime someone says Iron Throne
“If you had to choose between Rhaenyra and Aegon, who'd you have chosen?”  “I wouldn't have chosen either. It's all the choosing sides that made everything so horrible.”  “Sometimes a person must choose. Sometimes... the world forces his hand. If a man knows what he is and remains true to himself, the choice is no choice at all. He must fulfill his destiny, and become who he is meant to be. However much he may hate it.”
You know why this will flop cause there is no villain's that I see like Joffrey, Cersei or the knight king.
HBO, have you ever imagined a great ending? I did.
If I had to guess the dragons shown here were Caraxes, Syrax, Vhagar and Silverwing
I wonder which is Vhagar, probably the last one
looks terrible, anyway idc , not gonna watch it nor am I going to sub to hbo max
Ramin Djawadi ?
Finally the wait is over..... ❤️......let's play a game for Iron Throne 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥..... Game of blood, Game of Trust, Game of betrayal, Game of mind, Game of Power..... 🔥🔥🔥.....
It certain feels like a spin-off
poor "witchers" of Netflix!!
Damn this looks good, HBO is back with a banger🤘
Increibleeee
I am Waiting....
Now I need to watch an explainer video what is going on in this trailer. As it's been so long time ago I watched GOT.
The problem is, at least for me, even if this show is incredible and groundbreaking... it'd just make the wound all the deeper knowing what it would evolve into. The name is completely sullied imo and nothing can change that.  Yes, I can watch for mindless time kill - but that is not the mark of a good show. I'm simply not invested. So why bother at all?
This looks awesome!!
Can’t wait
Dollar store game of thrones
I hope night scenes are not as dark as "The Long Night (Eps)" in GoT S8, cause it would be nice to see whats actually going on.
take a shot every time they mentioned the "iron throne" lol
Looks like I’m ready to be hurt again
Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. I am skipping this entirely. Good luck and thanks for the fish.
я думал они покажут, как Таргарианы захватили власть, а тут игра престолов 2.0
DRAGONS!!! ❤️❤️❤️
More woke pandering.
HBO max, please save Lord of the rings from Amazon. We want you to handle Lord of the rings for us. You Are The Greatest Of All Time HBO max.❤️
It’s not looking good lads.
Just keep Dumb & Dumber away from this and it’ll be fine. 👏🏽
This is what I wish dumbass Amazon would do with Rings of Power. Thankfully at least one fantasy show will be worth watching
Quite exited for this one. Especially for the complex relations of Targaryens and of course for the Dragons
This dude Matt Smith is in everything now I'm starting to like this actor He looks evil!!
Hope they don't ruin it too
Hahah they just had to make a black targaryen and a feminist storyline, HBO trying to be netflix so hard 🤣🤣
it's not the winter is comig now it's the dragon are coming
2:30 Sunfrye? If it is Sunfrye then that clip is probably the scene that involves that dragon (Sunfrye) and if it is that scene I’m thinking of…… Oh all the Stark fans that defended the 💩 storm that is season 8 (and defended Drogons reaction to what to Dany in the final episode) will feel so stupid for defending that season and Drogons reaction 😁😁😁
Funny thing is is that they both lose both in the end. Well technically the greens win but you know
Is that Criston Cole at 1:00?
Well this looks very disappointing. Specially the soundtrack.
I can't wait to see house Targaryen at it's mightiest!
My jaw hurts
Please, please, please be good.
Fire will reign, Blood will be spilled and Hopefully GoT will be redeemed.
"I will create a new order."  We've heard that one before haven't we Miss? Or after... whatever... That Scarlet-coloured dragon is absolutely gorgeous btw. 🐲🔥🔥🔥🔥
LOOKS SO GOOD
Amazing
HBO's last chance to milk what they can from the GoT series due to bombing both the series and DVD sales.
Get ready for disappointment,  coming soon.
Everything about this trailer is a masterpiece. HOTD, don't let me down!
Superb 👌👌🔥🔥🔥
Надеюсь добро победит 😈
Go go go
Its Gonna Be awsm❤️🔥
I'm sorry but I was under the impression that this family was fair skinned with platinum blonde hair. Some of these Dragon family members look ... forced into this. Pass.
See!  This is what "The Rings of Power" trailer was missing: clear plot, clear character goals and conflict, clear stakes and danger, not just 'I had a premonition, a feeling, that something evil might be coming, and there are different people in this world.'
it looks spectacular!
L
Ah yes, the classic blackwashing of every modern show. Forcing "diversity" into a pale, white-haired race of crazy people. Stunning and brave.
Did I get cringey Daenerys vibes 😩😂
Can’t wait!!!
Watch them go and black wash more European fantasy. -,.,- dude look cringy.
As long as I don’t see any Starbucks cups or water bottles I am SO excited for this.
Was that a Barathean knight I saw
Dragons look more scary. Can't wait to see them
What a Great Work.very exited🎬🎬🖤
Oh my god. the characters, the dragons. I can't wait.
I already know the guy with the eye patch will be my favourite character. This is hype
hype🔥
eyes roll with the heads
I think this is the best trailer for a show I've ever seen.
We better see a lot of dragon scenes.
Let’s go!!
Here’s to hoping for a strong start AND strong finish!
OMGGGG AHHHHHH
I wouldn't have anyone but HBO attempt to make a show like this, but still some of the scenes and CGI (not dragons) look subpar
Despite feeling so disappointed by GOT S8 , this has definitely made me feel optimistic about a new story in this world. Looking forward to it!
Ughhhh i can’t wait this prequel is look soooo good sooo far yessss we need that story in the little screen
im gunnu puke, im too excited
Aemond Targaryen is a gigachad
Love the Venus in Furs cover
I guess I'm a little confused because literally all the drama and conflict is just..."sexism exists". She's not a worse leader or mad or stupid, she's just a woman and so all happens? It's rather straightforward and also quite unfair, why would the audience root for anyone else?
So much women empowerment. Hard skip.
HERMOSO
2:17 that dragon is not Syrax or Caraxes. Who it should be? Looks a lot similar to Drogon... I'm so excited...
how many seasons ?? just wanna know.
Please be good. Please be good. Please be good. Please be good.
Unpopular opinion, even if this prequel could be a great show, we all know the story ends with a wet fart.
great
Those dragons look so cheap to be honest
No other fantasy series looks as good as this.  I see what the reviewers mean when they say it's Shakespearean.
IM SO FREAKING EXCITED!!!!!!!!!!! *said whilst mentally preparing for amazing characters to all die horribly*
I know its fantasy but the black skin and white hair is too much fantasy for me.
Where Are My Dragons
Those dragons 🔥🔥 THOSE DRAGONS 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Omg total chills. I cant wait to return to Westeros. Lets see if HBO max subscribership goes up with this show
As long you *do not* go Woke with your new series, HBO, then this series will earn my *FULL* attention~
Interesting take on Venus in furs.
Name one woke series that has been successful...go ahead I'll wait
I CAN'T WAIT!!!!
who else  has high hopes for the BGM ??
Ehhhhh more of the same
This looks epic can't wait until they intentionally ruin the ending again
A different era at a different time but it's all the same  blood power lust drama ❤️
Night King lasted less than a day in Winterfell, heck Theon held Winterfell much longer. Remake SEASON EIGHT OR GTFO.
This looks like it would be such a good watch... but why would i watch this when i saw how y'all did my girl Dany? nah, it's a miss from me
1:27 and just like that I'm out
All right while other tv shows blow up before they start this holds lots of promise
The music. Ohhh man! Ramin isn’t playing around. 2mins of pure heaven. This trailer is 🤯🤯🔥🔥
Where I can see this in india ?
Ok this is gonna be good specially with George RR Martin Helping with the series. I'm sorry House Of The Dragon is gonna be far FAR better than The Lord Of The Rings: The Rings Of Power and I'm planning to watch both
My jaw
Wow.
Lets hope they dont make a stupid last season like the original got.
the BGM elevetes the feel of the show
Caraxes looks Dope
Jajaja que poronga.
Iam sorry but i honestly can't get excited anymore.  I really can't
Caraxes and Syrax 😯😯😯
its morbin time
Wait a sec, is that matt Smith
Yeah.... we kinda all know how this ends..... And now we gonna play like she had influence?!
mehh  i dont think i will watch it seeing how Got ended. it left a me with a bitter taste.
Just marvellous
Its Even Surpassing GOT😍😍😍
When will come HBO max 🇮🇳 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
Thank God I've got an imminent show to watch that won't let me down! Cheers, HBO 😊👍
Dance of the dragons... 🤩
F*ck all of this. I want a parallel timeline where Robert stayed king and we just follow him around as he "runs the kingdoms" (aka drinking, joking, whoring, and insulting lancel)
Where are the white walkers?? Where's bloody Wall??
I hope well be able to see balarion the dread
Check out more from House of the Dragon here:  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSduohp5OGX5tYPOtjlYnwucsjMtpgGQN
I can't wait for it.  It's really AAAAAAAAAAwesome  🔥🔥🔥❤❤❤❤💯💯💥💥 Love from India 🇮🇳
You all ready for the next 8 year disappointment?
I am filled with a lot of excitement now😍😍😍😍😍
Looks so good
Meh.  I can’t get excited for anything GoT after how they butchered seasons 6-8.
Who is bootleg Emilia Clarke?
Binod
Amazing pls be better than S8!!!
Great storytelling and character development combined with amazing visuals. Every frame is a work of art, almost every frame is a masterpiece. Overall, this show is simply beyond compare.
Also is that Aemon one eye, fighting.
Please tell me that the last dragon we saw was the one whose skull was massive and kept under the red keep.
Is this prequel of game of thrones?
No Dumb and Dumber, Im in
How incredibly amazing Caraxes looks! I'm in love!!
King in the North want to return! 🔥
Look at all these bought comments. I have zero faith in this.
Meh
Woof
just when i thought i was out they PULL ME BACK IN!!!!
Я очень надеюсь они не обосрутся и будет хотя бы на уровне последних сезонов ИП, но не ниже
Right now my biggest concern is that they use the same formula used from season 6 to season 8, meaning leaving the political thriller aspects behind in order to prioritize the action elements. Seasons 1 to 3 where the pinacle of the show and there was only one giant battle in there (blackwater), the political themes where the main focus and it was great. Either way I'm hyped af for this show
Can not wait for this one
What was the blonde budget on this series?
WWOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWW THIS TRAILER!!
I hate when shows or movies do this. We know that cersei was the first ever female ruler. So either you destroy the lore or we know this chick won't win the throne. Terrible either way
will this also cover rob’s rebellion?
Yes and no, i think we prefer new GOT season 7th and 8th…
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Poor Matt smith one dud after another
Hopefully the plot and writing don't turn out like season 7 and 8 especially for game of thrones 😂
✨💢💥🐉🔥🐲💢✨
Looks okay but needs MORE representation.   I see too many White People!
YAWN!!!
Looks better than any season of game of thrones
Everything looks amazing. This and EEAAO saved 2022 media world from being a snoozefest.
Boy, what a Year to the Fantasy Geek Comunity...
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Aman tanrım diyorum başka bir demiyorum Bu neee diğer dizileri geçicek gibi Umarım bu sene çıkan en iyi dizi olur Çünkü en çok bunu bekliyorum
that daemon's dragon giving me smaug vibes 😨
I hope this will end well .
Where is queen Emilia
Okey I had high expections for this show. But this is just something else🔥🔥
My goodness, so lovely!!!  that Venus In Furs by The Velvet Underground backsound with tribe vibes makes me goosebumps 🔥
I have no clue how to feel about this.. I want to get hyped about this but I can't.
I can’t wait to watch everyone who hopes this show will be anything more than barely adequate get their hopes squashed
Alicent and Rhaenyra causing the rift the in the iron throne:) this is about to be the best show show of the century:)
where are the Starks 🐺??
HBO will take on stupid show's like this but not The Boys 🗿
how many episodes per season
great!!!!!!!!!!!!1
👏👏👏👏 ohh yyyeeessss
Wow.  They've literally learned nothing.
Thought this show ended badly
AAAAAA
The dragon CGI is nice, everything else is horrible especially the paid for gallery in the comments below. Some of which just make no sense. The story as articulated in this trailer is also completely inaccurate to any single book and makes no sense relative to GoT s1. total trash
The more dragons the better. We fans will forgive some of the BS if yall give us more DRAGONSSSS
I'm sure this will be another piece of woke crap...
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The Targaryens lose. The end.
When I'm queen, I'll create a new order.. 🔥
still don't agree to make the valerians black just to make them black but whatever lol just goes against lore
I hope the ending is convencing compared to Game of thrones
Meh too late
Will it stream on Disney+ Hotstar in india?
George hasn't written a ton about the start of his world, but this just looks like Dany doing Dany stuff again...   "I will create a new order!"  "I will break the wheel!"  -The same character probably...
Looks okay, but I feel SJW influence here... And I also see here bad acting in some parts...
that repeated black fade transition was so annoying lol
I really love the new soundtrack 😍😍😍
I won’t mention other things except the dialogues between characters, this does not have the feeling of npc dialogues and acting like in GOT season 8
Dragons looking great
1:17 Blackfyre, the sword of House Targaryen. All there’s left is Dark Sister.
Remake season 8
Damn this looks so good! This could be the redemption for the failure of season 8...
more dragons and less humans please
The big big dragon...
Please release in  India dubbed in Hindi
I just peed. This is too exciting!!
Ugh, this serie is gonna be woke.
Please subvert our expectations (by making it good).
We shall see… as of right now the Targaryen’s are completely ruined for me with how things ended. So an entire prequel series sounds like it could be really bad depending on the writing.   Look at Obi Wan Kenobi…that show was a prequel and because there were zero stakes and the writing was really questionable in a lot of areas it ended up not being good at all. So let’s hope this one will make me love the Targaryen’s again and be excited to watch the next episode.
I only watched first season of game of thrones don’t remember much but I know I didn’t like it. Should I watch this?
Muito ansioso pra aasistir
What I do know is this, this is gonna smash 10 times harder than Rings of Power Xd
The Dragon looks very....fleshy
Never forget season 8. Never forgive. Never will I be fooled again.
Stop stopppppp!! It's already dead
So, HBO, just a quick question: will you butcher this series like you did with the last GoT season?
Is that the dagger that Arya has
tiktok has already clocked your deleting of comments !!! wow
Where's the night king?... Please show himmmm
Looks good. Will definitely be watching
I think the last dragon was vhagar
Cinematography is great!! I hope the storyline is good.
Why does it seem softer
മലയാളികൾ കട്ട waitingggg 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼🔥🔥🔥
They have give too much away
And dragons are here!
🔥🔥🔥
Woooow! 😍😍😍🤩🤯 It's gorgeous!!!!!!
Mmmm everything looks great but the dragons....
lord of the rings could learn a lot from this trailer
How on earth can HBO be trusted with this? As soon as they ran out of source material, they completely cocked it up. Just leave it dead and buried.
dear god this looks so horrible
yeeeees black targaryens, diversity !!!
The music is great
I can’t wait.  I have a feeling this is going to be better then GOT.
~please please be good
there better be got early season levels of lewedness
This is awesome ❤️❤️ ON MY BIRTHDAY THE SERIES RELEASES
damn.....so many agendas being pushed in one show.
Yeah, this actually looked interesting and mostly true to the book. Liked the implication of the timeline as portrayed and the actors seem to fit the roles. And of course it was coherent as a narative in-trailer. All-in-all a very good start. And at least a 1000x better than the already disjointed mess that's going to be it's competition (Lord of the Farce: Rings of anti-Canon).
Wow look at all that diversity.
Yes!
Let’s hope Matt Smith gets to finally show off his acting range after being wasted in Morbius
It was then that pasty, pudgy Teora raised her eyes from the creamcakes on her plate.  "It is dragons."            "Dragons?"  said her mother.  "Teora, don't be mad."       "I'm not.  They're coming."       "How could you possibly know that?" her sister asked, with a note of scorn in her voice.  "One of your little dreams?"       Teora gave a tiny nod, chin trembling.  "They were dancing.  In my dream.  And everywhere the dragons danced the people died."
No sarcastic comments yet?
LET'S GET IT!!!!! In my best fan boy voice. LoL 🤣😆🤣
I can already hear "Sweet Home Alabama" in a distance. LOL jk
Yeeeesssss
What's with this sub standard music though?
Looks mid af but will still give it a watch and see how the story grows on me
Are all the books released/completed for this story?
niggarys targeryan
I will pass, Rings of Power it is for me
Ramin Djawadi does it again. That Velvet Underground cover sounds dope!
"It's meeee... Spikeeey."
Brutaaaaaaaal
To reset our bad memory we need a sequel tooo.
Can’t wait to not watch this. Can’t believe people are still interested in GOT content after dreadful ending. Won’t be wasting my time
Game of thrones……
budget dani
I hope it will be the decade's finest show
Who is the dragon at the end ?
Om7g's.  I am so stoked 4 this show.  Excellent trailer
Man, this looks like the must-miss television event of the year!
Seriously, 2022, I'm not ready!!! This and Amazon's the rings of power. 🤤
IS THAT BALERION😨
Peak fiction is back!
brazil misses daeneryssssss so soooo much. bring her back.
Black Targarians lol
i don't understand the  point of a black man with blonde hair in the show ? :V
more feminist garbage.
imma pass... after that GOT finale im waiting for rings of power
HBO Max loses subscribers like Netflix
Oh no a black guy, this is too woke for me I can't manage  How will I survive 🥱
OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG CARAXEEEEEEEEEES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
plizzzzzzzzz dubed in hindi india love game of thrones     and also we like to house of dragone  🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Lord of the Rings has the budget of all budgets  And yet this just looks way better visually.   How? I don't know, but hopefully both are good in their own way.
Is that the bird from Bates Motel?
The hardest part of making this show must've been finding british people who didn't play in GOT
Wtf is this music 😭
Things that should have happened in Season 8 :   Go back to the 10 episode format to give the scenes time to breathe. Bran gets his personality back. He is no longer robotic after fully mastering his powers. Jaime goes to The Twins where he finds Edmure Tully laying low with his wife. He tells Jaime that Arya had freed him. Now lord of Riverrun & The Twins, he and Jamie gather the loyal, and head to Winterfell. The remaining children of the forest, Howland & Meera Reed show up with their people at Winterfell. There's no tension between Sansa & Daenerys because the Nightking is too big of a threat for politics. The NK is the big bad end boss, not Cersei or Darnerys. Tyrion goes back to being smart again, and suggests sending scouts (like he used in season 2 for Stanis) to King's Landing & Dragon Stone to see what Cercei is up too. After the wall came down, The Night King flew down the coast from Eastwatch while his generals proceed south with the dead. The NK burns Kings Landing & the Red Keep to the ground. After a demoralizing battle in Winterfell, the dead swarms, and overruns the castle. The unsullied, dothraki, Nymeria with her wolf pack, and the dragons keep the dead army at bay while the living flee south. In King's Landing, half a million dead (the other half were scorched) rise with the NK leading. Euron, his fleet, and the golden company are part of the dead now. Yara survives because she was tied up on Euron's ship, and was not in the city. Cersei, Qyburn, The Mountain, and a handful of Lannister soldiers had escaped, and headed north. The Night King's southern army decimates every kingdom while they head north. Cersei realizing the fallacy of power while having a miscarriage becomes a shell of herself after seeing what the Night King did with Viserion. Arya & the hound stay with the northern armies.
looks cool but not cool as GOT
Daenerys dragons were prettier
this better not flop..
Didn't Danaerys Have a brother in GOT?
i can't wait!!!!!
But don’t we already know that he becomes king, or r they going to change the backstory for female empowerment ;)
How many years before GOT is this?
Won't ever forgive them for what they did to GoT. Don't have the time and courage to invest in this one. Sorry.
how many gender bender bi fluid characters there will be? that is my question
Rings of power bah! lol
How can I get invested in this story knowing the future events being so polarizing?
I wish they would give us Sara Snow, Princess of Dragonstone 😉
Jenny of Oldstones playing in the background gives the chills.
Look at all these astro turfers in the comments. This show looks like complete woke garbage.
if they stick to the source material, this has the potential of being better than even Game of Thrones ever was!
TEAM RHAENARA
How does the production quality look leagues ahead of rings of power?  Both stories look like manure but at least this has good visuals
Wow
🦶
Wish Balerion was in the show....
Looks awesome!!
cant be worse then the last season
Nigurumishe kama kisiagi🔥🔥🔥
On fire! We are impatient to watch the show of all times.
I hAVe goosebumps
I can tell you 100% certain this will be bad just based on one actor they cast.
I'm so excited!!!! I feel like a kid on Christmas Eve. It looks AMAZING!!
The Red Dragon whose name is Caraxes i believe gave me goosebumps
There is no such thing as a black Valyrian, why do studios always race/gender change. Disgusting.
Impressive work on the dragons ! This trailer is very engaging.
I am so hyped for the series! The story itself looks promising already, especially the new scenes where the dragons are flying high above the clouds. The CGI is far better and realistic than that of Game of Thrones. It is absolutely breathtaking!
PLEASE LET THIS BE AMAZING.
How do you make a black targaryen? Was he just born black without his parents needing to be like him?
pass
I'm honestly so hyped for this.
Pretty much dont know how to feel, meh maybe?
Can't wait , everything looks perfect. HBO really did awesome work.
Is anyone really gonna invest time into this after the way they screwed the ending up?? “Winter is coming”…….aaaand it’s gone!
great job
Waiting for this series.
Happily waiting for this thing to fail
Im soo excited and i just cant hide ittt
😳😳🥺😁🔥🔥👍
This show is for anyone that started GOT after hearing about it for six seasons, and then watched the first episode and thought, "Wait, I thought that there was supposed to be dragons in this show." Cannot wait.
I'm having a hard time getting interested in this, because I'm not ready to get disappointed again. But I will give it a shot.
This series will break all the rules and all the records like dragons destroy all the records with thier fireeeeeeeeeeeee🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Is this still a thing? When are they going to get through their heads that GoT is over. They killed it.
Hope it doesn't flop. 😂
gay
Miss
This actually looks really good. I hope they don't mess it up like GoT.
Redemption arc??!!
This has the feels of a Telenovela. I'll give it a shot but I'm not going in with high hopes.
Ah....finally..... My wait comes to end....that feeling of GOT no one would ever gave...hoping that house of the dragon will full fill it....🖤🔥
yawn.......woke crap!
HBO max, I Love you. This Will Be The Best And The Greatest experience in history of TV. You see stupid cringe Amazon, That's How you handle mega huge franchise.
WOW !
The cinematography, the background score, the VFX, the cast... All looks spectacular...
info nobaaar jakartaa baraat!!!!! 🔥🔥
omg im so excited for this
This looks absolutely fantastic
1:46 Is that Balerion?
Neat
Struggling to get excited about this with how GOT ended.
i was a huge fan of GoT so i’m really excited for this
Yeah, looks cool. Let's just hope the writing is actually good. All the gorgeous cinematography and costumes in the world can't compensate for weak writing. We need seriously strong storytelling, world-building, and character development.
👍
No spoilers but i wanna ask -  Are there major plot twists in this story like in Game of Thrones?coz that'd be awesomee
Prepare for two or three good seasons before the fall.
Cant wait for season 8
Amazing
Lets goooo
What the... we still don't get to see Aegon or Aemond. Why?
Take a shot every time they say “iron throne”
You know nothin' HBO.
GREAT... Thank the gods that D and D are not around to soil this master piece
We love you from Pakistan 🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰👌
I'll wait for a leak of the finale's script before start watching it 🤭
The creators are openly anti-white and I won't support anti-whiteness and blackwashing. Hard pass.
How did Smaug land up here?
to the fans ... can I watch this before GOT ? there's no way I can binge GOT quick enough but I wanna watch this with the rest of the world , it says its a prequel but what do u guys think ?
Everybody wants the Iron Throne. Again! Here we go
Hopeful, but the wigs look awful
Hmmm ok
This already looks better than The Rings of Power😂
Great balerion iş coming
First born male is always hier. don't really see the dispute.
Nah... Not falling for that again.
AHHHHHHH THIS MADE MY DAY!!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥
im hyped for some Stepstones action with King Daemon
Caraxes is looking real good  I think the dragon at the end is vhagar but i could be wrong, also is balerion dead by this point ? cause i have always wanted to see him in live action
If this is half as good as the first seasons of Game of Thrones, then it will be a masterpeice.
Every time HBO drops anything thrones related I’m like 👁 👄 👁 (let me see it NOW)
Looks great but after the disaster of the last season of GoT I’m very hesitant.
Team Black!
Syrax at the end?
dios  <3
i hope to see at least 5 deaths and 3 naked women in the first episode
Matt Smith is GREAT
Can't wait for Matt Smith's daemon targaryen. He was born to play this role!!!
LONG LIVE QUEEN RHAENYRA TARGARYEN
Is deamon a book charachter?
🔥
HBO is going to Kick Amazon Prime’s butt this summer/autumn!
looks lame
Just remember 1 thing, y’all: the road ends at season 8 of Game of Thrones.
I wish I could be excited for this....but I'll never forget how badly they ruined GOT. You will fail trying to catch lightning in a bottle.
Ahh lots of love from Bangladeshi🇧🇩
I'll wait to see if it gets renewed for a second season before I start watching.
What the Actual F!! This might just be even better than the first one we watched few years ago!!
I am skeptical, the last season of GoT had beautiful work as well. But we all know how that turned out.
well, they better not disappoint us this time
Man this looks beautiful! The acting, the visuals, the dragons, the costumes, the designs. ugh, everything looks stunning!! This is going to be freakin awesome!
fabulousssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss i cant wait anymore 21 aug is toooooooooooooooo far
Will the production be beautifully shot? Of course. Will it have soul and meaning? Of that I am entirely skeptical.
What's with a quarter of the people having Rubbermaid Commercial Economy Cotton Mop Heads for hair
I wonder which dragon was that in the end?? Was it Syrax or Vhagar??
🔥🔥🔥
😍👌
I really hope this time the lack of source material doesn't hinder it since the dance of dragons is already a complete story.
So how did Targaryens develop blonde hair if half their family is suddenly black? :) F'n hollywood man, with their diversity quotas.
Diversity Targaryens.. yeaah
I actually have less interest in watching this then I do the Amazon Lord of the Rings which will be awful
Alicent hightower did nothing wrong!
I like how the trailer makes it all look like a big feminism uprising but knowing how it all ends makes it hilarious
Can't wait... 🔥 🔥 And the music and bgm was Just fu@king awesome 🔥
"HBO Viewers kinda forgot about GoT"
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I love when Matt Smith says : it's Targerien time
Hope it captures the vibes of when Game of Thrones was good
This looks as good as season 8!!!   I especially loved being beat over the head with gender politics.
These dragons designs look really good best of all they’ll have more screen time then the ones from Game of Thrones did. I’m really hyped to see them in action in this show!!
Looks amazing
I want the long night!!!!
Everything looks promising except the adaptation of the Velaryons
This is gonna be EPIC 🤩🤩
When dragons come, something crazy comes with them too.🐉
Ou xitis 🇧🇷
The final season sucked, I’ll wait for reviews before watching
‪Visually stunning and epically promising! 🔥‬
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This better live up to the reputation of the early seasons of  Game Of Thrones. I don't want to be get extremely hyped for something for nothing like season 8 ever again.
so so so so so unserious. the teasers other day briefly shown jon, and even drogon but we nevver saw dany. it just dawnedd on me how much i miss her, she really is the greatest of all time.
"Valar morghulis."
it's HBO, it will be good. buuut, i have this nagging sinking feeling it's going to be more hype than substance.  i'm not hating, i hope it does well.
All that CGI budget, and they can't afford decent wigs 😂 this show will be garbage
Espero que seja melhor que senhor dos anais da Amazon prime👍
AHHHHHHH LOOKS SO FUYCKING GOOODDDD FIRE AND BLOODD OMG CARAXEDS LOOKS AMAIXZAJMSMGBHNDFJKGNDMF,S
Without spoiler 🔥 🐉+ 🐲 all we need 😀
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
So is this a prequel? I have not been following along, but have to admit it looks better than what I was expecting
💥💥💥💥💥🐲👌💫✨
CARAXES !
Omg excited from India 🇮🇳 😍.
Best birthday gift 🥳
I want to kill the one who created the dragons in the series.  In Game of Thrones they would look so real and revolutionary, here they look like in a computer game!  How disappointed I was to start really crying over how you ruined the almost most important thing in this whole series
if only they hadnt ruined the original show. maybe then I would be interested

120 738
I will never forgive what HBO did to GoT
I dunno. I got my heart ripped out of my chest and violently stomped on the last time I set foot in Westeros...
i think it's thefirst time i could say... it looks better than lord of the ring (the rings of power)
Jfc how does Matt Smith keep getting work, cannot take it any bit seriously with his face in it. Morbius drove that point home
Yawn
Daemon Targaryen is very similar to the Croatian football player Domogoj Vida
OMG AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
HBO: Why a prequel over all the other spin-offs? Producers: One word - Dragons
*yawn*
This look amazing
DAEMON 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
So excited
Gentlemen you have my attention before now you have my interest.
Why didn’t they give this love to game of thrones :(
Eu sou um robô de zack snyder 🤖🇧🇷👍
you know what they say...everytime a targaryen is born the gods flip a coin
Some of the scenes look really low budget / have bad CGI. Comparing it to GoT, because comparing it to everything else like the Rings of Power show it looks the same
I've GoT chills and goosebumps even on places i did not know it was possible
Fight scenes swords and armours looks epic
When a game of thrones spin off looks better than a LOTR spin off -_-
omfg
I hope they won’t ruined the ending of this like they have done with GOT.
One Questions.... Is it gonna be better than the previous  Game of Thrones with all the plot holes  — True fan Asking
The trailer makes it seem like a cookie cutter medieval fantasy show.
The attention paid to details of the dragon 2:30 will tell about the epic work..
Its game of thrones. But with more Dragons
I'M SO DARN EXCITED!!!! DRACARYS!
ahhhh it looks so good! the costumes look incredible! counting down the days till august 21st!
Black targaryens?
Sickkkk bruh
meh ,show jumped the shark long ago
I need this now. Thanks
I think her name is Rinea as that’s a good name
Thanks HOTD and HBO max for releasing it on my birthday
Love and excitement from India 🔥🐉
August 21st can't come quickly enough!! the trailer looks amazing😍
This looks better than GOT
I'm ready. The costumes, the battle scenes, the music!!!
Shiny, shiny, shiny boots of leather
Sick!
CAN NOT WAIT!!!
WE WUZ
For the throne
يخرب بيت ام الحمماااااس
WOW !!!! JUST WOW!!!!
Increibleeee!!
Obviously this will be good. But what about the ending ?
Looks awesome
AAAAAHHHHH NECESITO MAYUSCULAS MAS GRANDES
🔥 ഇതു പൊളിക്കും
Dreamfyre is coming.
2:20 heyy it's Catspaw Dagger! That's nice
I dont know what to say let the targeriyans to arrive the trailer is massive  and I loved it the bgms the back ground them every thing was perfect i am gonna say that this will break every thing  ,🔥🔥🔥so let s wait and be ready for #HOTD
STOKED
the way these dragons look, feels like they're beasts Daenerys' dragons felt like characters  How don't know if that's good or bad 2:22 he needs more micro movements, his nostrals, his eyebrows, his lips, even his eyes, it's all very static... it's like he's numb xD
About time something good came back to HBO.  It has been complete woke dogshit for at least 2 years now
More woke crap of 2022
Well, the entire Targrayen family hasn’t been race swapped into a confusing “hands across America” gang so this is already 100 times more promising then that Amazon LOTR abortion.
Do you guys think they'll have the balls to show Cannibal, the dragon that ate other dragons?
On repeat 🥵🥵😈🔥♥️
LET'S GOOOO!!
Cinema. Plain and simple.
The lack  of representation is disgusting. Not one trans person of colour or able bodied  member of the lgbtq community
I am sworn to carry your burdens
Wait.... @01:47 is that Vhagar?? Nothing we've seen such big till now. It must be Vhagar if not Balerion 🥺🔥🙏
Can’t wait 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
💯💯👌
Bloodmoon!!!
Matt Smith is marrying a queen yet again.
The trailer beat goes hard fr
I cant wait until aug 21
Prequel is looking so damn hot 🔥🔥🔥 hoping it will create tense in audience pulse  @HBO
Waiting HBO Max India launch
Seems like simple and less complex story than Got
I am already cringing for the amount of misogyny that's going to get flung around in fandom spaces, but that will not keep me from watching!
🖤🔥
I'm ready to be hurt again
Kerala fans here he he🥵❣️
This looks beautiful✨😍
Well, this actually looks really good!
just remember, this all ends with Bran The Broken
Hopefully this will be the Better Call Saul of Game of Thrones
where is the hope. if we saw how dany ends, the targaryen line, how it abrupt just is gonnerz, how can we have any hope? treat so vile and for what? we saw how they all enddddd ffs. change that
Love it how they snuck Jenny of Oldstones in the trailer's music, very fitting
We wuzzzzz velaryon n shieeet jeeeeah nika
I know this is a farcry, but I would love to see justice for the white walkers if able!!
We'r going to witness Season 8 Quality with great script and acting 🔥❤️🐉
And it seems that the producers will rival Dane and Dave's incompetence. Also that they have not watched game of thrones. I see a resident evil Netflix style in end of august.
Watched it 5 times in a row
The Dragonpit looks Phenomenal 👌🏾 OHH I can't wait.. House Targaryen at the peak of its Power with about 18 Dragons (I think 🤔). Same Houses but different Characters and  different dynamics. This time House Hightower will be a Major Family in the story; powerful players in the Game.  As a fan of House Baratheon can we PLEASE SEE STORMSEND!!!
Morbius 2: House of Morbius
Where's Aegon ii ????
I want to like this but season 8......
It looks awesome, I can’t wait for it
we need a game of thrones videogame
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
If Dumb & Dumber haven't touched this show, then I'm kinda excited.
House Of Dragon sounds like voguing ball family
I have 4 point's to say  •For some reason I'm getting the Witcher vibe  •The dragon CGI looks kinda skitchy •Corlys velaryon still can't stand the guy and the way they changed it in the name of wokeness •
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Dragons and Daeny were one of my favourite parts of GOT. This newest trailer is the most exciting yet. I truly feel the greatness here. Let's get it! I cannot wait to see the House of Targaryn in its height. EEEEEEEK! The excitement is REAL! Watch party? :P
عظمة
Bold move Cotton, GoT was trash
🔥 ♥️
Is this Venus in Furs I hear starting at 00:56?
This looks pretty woke to me.  I might watch the first episode.
THIS SHOW IS POINTLESS, THEY ARE ALL DEAD, THE FINAL BATTLE WAS WITH WHITE WALKERS, THIS MUST BE IN THE FUTURE RATHER THAN THE PAST
torrents here i come
Does this show have dragons in it?
Didnt they know back then that they could shoot down the dragon from a ship propelled by oars, having a gigantic ballista and with no training at all???
Poor amazon. Once again HBO is going to show you how you make a fantasy show. I'm just sad that lotr will be the fallen franchise here.
I don't care, I'm all hopes for this!
lol no thanks they ruined this series
This looks promising.... House of dragon is in good hands🔥 thanks to crew and GRRM .... cant handle the HYPE 👑👑👑👑 🐲🐉
1:33 sounds like daenerys.
George R.R Martin would be so proud of this masterpiece.
I'm going back to Westeros.
Looks cheesy. Sorry.
Ith powlikkum😎😎
"Over the centuries, House Targaryen has produced both great men and monsters. Prince Daemon was both. In his day there was not a man so admired, so beloved, and so reviled in all Westeros. He was made of light and darkness in equal parts. To some he was a hero, to others the blackest of villains."   PRINCE DAEMON TARGARYEN!!!!
Can't follow Game of thrones from beginning as I Bing watched that during corona times, I can't wait to see the house of dragons it will be an amazing experience to follow that from the first episode,I am just thrilled right now, hope for one of the best serious🥰
Caraxes
A Daenerys before Daenerys, no thank you
Wow amazing 👏🏾. I can't imagine that I'm more hyped for this than Rings of Power. We'll, maybe it's too soon for me to say that.
It seems that Ramin Djawadi has prepared something
man they really make it look like Rhaenyra is fighting Daemon lol
Ok, this seriously hypes me up!!!
Woah, the doctor travelled to Westeros?!
HBO = QUALITY 🔥
Lame... #MoreBreasts
Looks great, likely won't be a halo, rings of power or resident evil blunder, well hopefully but this trailer alone is promising
So I have not read the books, what is the name of the dragon in the trailer?
Damn this looks good and all but I really liked the design of the OG dragons way more
*standing ovation*
So it' GoT all over again... Just remake the last three Seasons!!!
Which dragon is that at the end?
Where's Duty, Where's Sacrifice...
I dont like the music they chose for this trailer
Looks amazing, love the design they chose for Caraxes
Yes this looks excellent 👍.
loool, having blacks as knights HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHA
I’m watching this for Matt smith only haha
already deleting negative comments. you are done
All Hail Aegon II, the True King.
please release in india 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭☹☹☹☹☹☹☹
There's always an issue with prequels that you'll know how it ends. No matter what happens, Robert's Rebellion will crush the Targaryen rule over Westeros. And then GOT will happen.  I wonder how they'll deal with it. Most prequels that do tend to go through it by adding new characters so we can question where they end up during or afterwards.
Syrax and Caraxes!!! And Aemond One-Eye And Balerions Foot  OMG I AM CRYING
No question about it. I am ready to get hurt again.
so I don’t remember game of thrones that much tbh you guys think I should re watch it before I watch this show or it won’t matter tbh?
🤗😍
“Now they see you as you are” gagged her a bit didn’t it 😭😭😭
The book was great, hope they stick kinda close to it
Im actually looking forward to this. Ive had enough of bad shows coming out like Wheel of Time and and Rings of power. So as long as this doesn’t go woke and does what the books is about, I think this will be epic and definitely worth a watch.  The music in this trailer is super cool and I think we all are looking forward to see dragons and the Targaryens reappear on screen again
Keep D and D away ftom this.
Any of my brothers from India
dragons go brrr as you may be aware
Where is Aegon?
I like how they made Caraxes actually look violent and bloodthirsty. It does seem like they are going to give the dragons different personalities too!
Despite how disappointing the ending to season 8 was. From what I've seen of this project it looks like the people working on it are passionate about delivering something the fans might actually enjoy. The visuals especially look to be on point. And in some areas actually surpass GoT from what's shown in this trailer. I love the more ornate armours and the expanded Iron Throne. Seems aesthetically closer to the world Martin envisioned in many ways. I just hope the plot delivers in the end!
War is afoot !
oh lord
It’s here!!
Now it's very tough for me to wait for one month more 😀
Dragons are coming...
All these beautiful visuals and dragons and i am one still not excited, you ruined GoT for me.
EU NEM ACREDITO QUE VOU VIVER ISSO NOVEMENTE
It looks amazing and I know a bunch of people who worked on it who all say it's gonna be sick and I trust them, the only thing is...I know Rhaenyra will never sit on the Iron Throne, because Cersei Lannister was the first Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. It's a problem with all prequels really. Oh well, I'm excited.
I AM HERE ONLY AND ONLY FOR THE MOST EVIL AND DIRTY FIGHT BETWEEN TWO BEST FRIENDS.
Finally, back to Westeros we go!
Super pumped! Let's goooo!
Ok...have you seen Caraxes? I mean...wow...this is going to be legen (wait a second) DARY!!!!!!!!!
This a great prequel to Succession
This is how I thought Ring of Power would be like..
I’m loving the looks of the dragons. These close-ups we get of who I believe is Daemon’s dragon, Caraxes the Blood Wyrm, look absolutely gorgeous 🔥🔥🔥
But where is Aegon II? Did they change the story? It suppose to be Aegon vs Rhaenyra, but i don't see him in any of trailers?
Winter Winter Winter ❄️
Every time a new Targaryen is born, the gods toss the coin in the air and the world holds its breath to see how it will land
Love HBO
😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳 ooomg !!! Can’t wait!!!
Don't like the music. But I"m hyped for the series.
im not hyped at all
SO excited. Hope no more s7-s8 directors here
Good news everyone this story will have an arguably satisfying ending as it's already been written
Average General audience would be pissed if they force lgbt characters and wokeness into this series lol.
war is afoot !
When will Hbo Max launch in India?
😍😍😍😍😍😍
Tá perfeitooo ❤️‍🔥😭😭
how is this different than got? same plot different timeline
Team Rhaenyra (or Black) here!!🔥   Their problem with Rhaenyra was that she was a woman that they forget that she's the first born child. With Daenerys, however, it is a little different. Although a kind and compassionate ruler(still, in the books), Dany is not the first child plus she's a woman. Rhaegar was born first, therefore Rhaegar would have gone first and his children (one of them being Jon Snow) after him even if he dies before he becomes king. But you feel way more bad for Rhaenyra, because the only reason why they opposed her was because she was a woman.   I also made this comment, cuz you always see comparisons with Dany and Rhaenyra. Plus, this trailer is pretty badass!!! I'm so excited to watch the show.
This nearly looks and feels bigger than the final season of Game of Thrones. The work that went into this series will not go unnoticed. It looks incredible. Well done, HBO... Well done...
This is THE tv event of the year
Looks epic
Different sauce. <3
Simplesmente perfeito, claramente os 200 milhões foram bem investidos, meu hype aumentou e MUITO depois dessa
This looks so beautiful and epic, I'm so hyped for this, can't wait to watch it.
For Rhaenyra!! ❤🖤
Y morí
When I am queen, I will create a new order💯💥
anyone else thing that the dragon at 1:48 looks ridiculously larger than any dragon we have seen before? or is it just me
RAMINNNNNNN
Feels like the old woman white hair is like Petyr Baelish who is manipulative and will be the cause of the chaos of the targaryens. The targaryen who looks margaery seems like problematic also
Awesome 😍😍😍😍😍🔥🔥⚡
Bande-annonce intéressante, mais un black avec des cheveux colorés en blond, c'est ridicule.
Please be good, please be good, please be good, please be good, please be good, please be good, please be good, please be good, please be good
This is going to be so so so much better than rings of power...
This cannot get here quick enough!
Finally I may able to forgive S7 and S8... Pls be good I am too excited...😍
This will be epic 🔥🔥
Fire and Blood! 🔥🔥🔥
Looks good! Between this and Rings of Power, we have an epic fantasy fall ahead of us!
This gave me chills and I am ready to be moved again by Westeros
It’s Morbin Time.
We play ugly game..
Why i don't likes prequels 😑😑...... i
Dragons 😻
2:23 I came mainly because of the cover image: What a nice design for the dragon. 🐉  This series promises a lot, the prequel to GOT, set 200 years earlier. And having read the Fire 🔥 and Blood book, I look forward to seeing battles between dragons in action. The Dance of the Dragons.
This new Draco Malfoy family tree show looks good
Chills.
I don't think it's fair to assume that this show is gonna be bad solely because of what happened with season 8. However, I will admit, that season did drastically lessen my excitement for this show, and for the franchise in general. But this trailer is so good. Damn, I think I might be excited for this.
Stop Fighting. Night King is Coming.
Yes.
THIS LOOKS SO GOOD. I will forever say the best part of game of thrones was the politics and scheming and this series that will be the most focus and I cannot wait!! The different looks of the dragons is AMAZING too omgggg
Shall we begin 🔥🐉🐲🐉🔥
THIS IS AN WORK OF ART.
Please remember to remove all Starbucks cups before filming... Although I'm skeptical, I want this to be awesome!
SO HYPED!
the music catalogue in this show is eating
No show gets you hyped for fantasy like Game of Thrones, I can’t explain it, but it feels like a big event.
I can’t wait !
Finally one of the televisions greatest ip is back. Can't wait
wait... the Targaryens and Velaryans were BLACK?????????
Looking great....
Oh god how excited I am ! Fire and Blood books are my favorites, totally obsessed with Targaryen family :) Cant wait for this!!
1:34 This screams Daenerys!!!!
Omg omg omg
Eu tô surtando!! Meu Deus que perfeição!!
يا دين امممممي
How do you not get excited for this. I mean just look at this
Meh. GoT burned itself to the ground with terrible writing, bad direction, and stupid calls. Let the IP die.
These guys understand the ASSIGNMENT. Caraxes looks so great and I'm so stoked for this cast this is gonna be incredible, the perfect balm for the open sore that was the end of GoT
LITERALLY HAD CHILLS THROUGH THE WHOLE THING
This makes me SO hyped. I love the music, the grand-scale epic fantasy vibe, how it feels both old and new at the same time.....this will be incredible. ❤ "The night will come alive with the music of dragons"....
She is my qween.
Team Black 🖤🔥
This looks unreal.
Well this looks like a waste of money.
I’m in awe. This looks absolutely incredible! And that track!!!
Game of Womenz
Best thing to watch After Peacemaker.
ഹെന്റമ്മോ 💥💯
GIVE ME ALL THE DRAGONS!!! 😍😍😍
It just like the game of thrones story
OMG!!!!!
HBO is back
Alright. I am feeling the hype now. If the show is as good as this trailer we're in for a great time.
So excited !!!!! This will be good !
Looks cheap.
Finally the wait is over
Finally something that's not fan made.
This looks low budget
Ramin Djawidi carrying
Bruh I swear i got the exact goosebumps I’ve got when GOT was streaming weekly can’t wait 🔥🔥🔥
Looks better than the Lord of the Rings one, not that I expect much from either
DIOSITOOOOOOOOOOO AMOOOOOOOOOO
🐉🔥🐉🔥🐉🔥🐉🔥🐉🔥🐉🔥🐉🔥
I'll only be watching it for the dragons!
YAAAAAAAAAAS!
I'M SCREAMING ALREADY!!!!
man i hope this is good
This looks promising nw...All teasers were nt upto the mark and were not able to surpass GOTs aura....But this trailer gives new shine to the whole new Era..
OMG everything thing is amazingggg ohhhhhh I’m about to cry this is perfection congratulations to the cast 👏👏👏👏
From here there will be beginning of a era
I got chills watching the trailer. I hope Aug 21 will arrive soon.
A B S O L U T E L Y    S T U N N I N G!!!
As a Lord of the Rings fan, I am still more excited for this than The Rings of Power.
I can't wait for the 8th season to crush all my hope's and dreams
Fix the last season
Absolutely stunning
HBO IS BACK TO RULE THE OTT 🔥🔥
dracarys🔥
"when i am queen i will form a new order", her voice sounds so much like khaleesi
“The dream was clearer than a memory-“. SOLD. TAKE IT. TAKE ALL OF IT.
Oh this new theme though I hope it plays during the title crawl.
I hope they show us the actual (fictional) events. The history books are inaccurate, and Fire and Blood is a (fictional) history book.
I rather watch breaking bad again , waiting for bcs new episodes.
HBO DONT LET US DOWN THIS TIME!
Long live House Targaryen 🐉 🔥
ai calica so vemmmm
HBO being HBO. As always. Thank you for this new gem.
CARAXES 😍😍😍😍😍
I wonder if there is a thing called an iron throne in this show?
Look at Hbo hearting comments. Sup! Not gonna watch but gonna comment anyway!
Oooooooh جااامد فشخ 🔥🔥🔥♥️♥️♥️
another feminist woke crap propaganda
where are the rest of the dragons!!!????. loving that we can see syrax and caraxes here!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Amazing ❤️
Targaryen's reign is coming
the dragons face didnt look as good as drogons.. but atleast the writers arent dumb and dumber
OMG I'M LITERALLY CRYING  FIRE WILL REIGN!!!! 🔥
So PROMISING, LIKE OMFG! 💫 Looks absolutely insane, one of the best trailers I have ever seen.  Seriously will watch the trailer at least a 100times before the show releases.  I hope they work on the dragons eye CGI a bit more, other than that I loved literally everything, the music, the dialogue and on and on.
I can't help myself but get hyped for this. Hope I'm not wrong again!
Gg
This is going to have to be spectacular and go a few seasons before I touch this. Season 8 still hurts.
it can't come soon enough!!!
🤩🤩🤩
This is going to be a MASTERPIECE 🔥 Waited almost three years for this ❤️
Looks amazing! Definitely can tell the upgrade in CGI. The dragons have armor like they should have. Caraxes the Blood Wyrm looks badass! I’m more excited than ever.
When it comes in hindi?
Hotd >> BB and BCS
This is going to HIT!!!!
Knowing the events this covered... prepare for the slaughter
Can't wait... Bring it on
Kudos to the vfx artists the trailer looks fab 💥!!!
What are these dragons. O goddddd
I honestly don’t know how to feel about this series, Game of thrones was amazing in its early seasons but the ending was so bad that it really soured the show as a whole for me
Rhaenyra will be the queen!
The dragons are gonna light up our screens just like GOT did!   Cant wait to see more of Westeros and the King's Landing politics!
This Is Gonna be Epic 🔥🔥 The Targaryens are Back
Looks better Than GOT 😂🔥
Dracarys🐉💥
Amazing💙Making perfection 🔥
2:30 SYRAX!!!
I'm speechless. This will be the best show in 2022.
Tbh, I started watching game of thrones for Dragon.. I’ll watch this too for the very same reason. Sounds lame, but come on it’s Dragon!!!! 😅🍻
Ente mone vishayam 🐉💥🔥
MORE DRAGONS
Malyali like adi
how after all these years the hair of the new "Daenerys" looks even more like a party city wig?
FIRE  & BLOOD !
Let The Incest Begin?? Jk... Can't wait for this ♥️♥️♥️
This looks stunning but let's hope they don't completely ruin it this time
George RR himself said the first season looks great.  The visuals are insane, even better than thrones, which is hard to do.  Remember that this is also based off of an RR Martin novel, not something that D&D came up with.  I have a lot of confidence that this will be better than seasons 7 & 8 of GOT.
Real quote from the show: "This is a real Game of Thrones the House of the Dragon has found themselves in."
If Succession was set in Westeros
Vhagar at the end🥵😍yes queen
It looks amazing. But still game of thrones have a special place in heart ❤️💯.
Waiting for the Mad king
I'm watching this just for the dragons, it will break my heart when they're injured and/or killed. More dragons, always. Thanks.
The music is 🔥🔥🔥🔥 as expected!!
Bruh thats a lot of spoilers also whats that music choice
Omg
എൻ്റെ മോനെ.....തീ ഐറ്റം 🔥🔥🔥🔥💥💥💥💥💥💥😍😍😍😍😍😍😍💯💯💯💯💯💯
Looks Woke. Pass.
The music!!! Wow this looks absolutely gorgeous! And emotional too. While the first two teasers felt very similar to Game of Thrones, this trailer has its own unique ambience. I can't wait!
This looks so true to the source material!!! I never thought I'd want to go back to this world after the disappoinment of the last show but this got me so so SO excited!!!
This is AWESOMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!
Yeah that settles it, cancelling any other plans August 21st
BRING DAENERYS BACK AND DOMINATE AGAIN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
🐐🐐
This is gonna be revolution
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Let’s be honest the real question is how good the intro is going to be?
So excited red dragon looks amazing ❤ and more dragons are coming we going to see their different names, nature, colors and personality 🐲🐉🧬🔥💫.....
I'm pretty skeptical of this whole thing but this looks amazing.
Can’t wait for those opening credits!!!
Can't lie, some of these dragon shots look like early 2000's videogame footage. I do hope the CGI gets touched up before the release.
I love you, Rhaenyra ❤️
After the legendary series GOT, i have been waiting for this one 🔥 hope it's a banger🔥
Epic prequel awaits 🔥🔥
Cool dragons
So exciting, I can't wait 😍🔥
The biggest show in television history is coming 🔥🔥🔥🔥
My day is done at work.
Let the fangirling begin.
don't think i've seen such ugly character design since... oh, rings of power
Fire and Blood!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA LA CONCHA DE SU MADRE QUE SALGA YAAAAAAAAA
Ayyyy mi madreee
Неймовірний трейлер!🐲
YESSSSSSS 🔥🔥🔥 fire and blood
A new era for GOT. 🔥
So much excited for this, but it still hurts when you know how it ended💔
We want Jon snow💔
Amazing 🔥🔥
It is exotic
Meus Deusssssssss...Vem Agosto.
Now THAT'S what I'm talkin' about!!!
The best is yet to come ...hold your breath for HOD guys 🔥😍
Idk why, but I'll only like this show if it somehow compensates Dany's death
Stop fighting with Each Other. Unite all together against The White Walkers and Night King.
Looks amazing!!!! PLEASE!!!!! Do not screwed up like GOT season 8, I just can't wait to see it!!!!
DRACARYS
Looks stunning!!
Wow
Wow….
I swear am running out of patience... HOD, please come to papa
I only recognize the 11th Doctor and Art3mis from Ready Player One
I'm dying, I need this in my life NOW
Woahhh ❤️❤️
OMFG OMFG OMFG!
YOO. LETS GO!
Here we go again 🐉
At 0:57 is stunning 🤯 music for Ramin...
Man this looks beautiful! The acting, the visuals, the dragons, the costumes, the designs. ugh, everything looks stunning!! This is going to be freakin awesome!
Goosebumps. Just pure goosebumps
OLIVIA COOKE LETSGOOOOOOOOOO
Valar morghulis
يا ويلكم إذا كاركسيس مو بنفس شكله بالرواية يا ويلكم 😭😭
🔥🔥
Well, looks better than The Rings Of Power :D
YES, DRAGONS!!! THATS ALL I WANT!!!
Takes you back to the time of GOT with endless discussions, everyone having their own theories of predicting the next move in a world full of chaos, betrayal and much more. Let's go once again, old friend.
Epic just epic
This trailer is way better than the first. HBO don’t make us feel stupid for getting high hopes again ❤️!!!!!!
The best TV series of the decade mark my words
❤️🔥❤️🔥❤️🔥
OMG looks incredible and dragons - pure art, no words. Its gonna be fantastic feast again!
OH MY GOD THIS IS BREATHTAKING
2:02 aemond Targaryen 🔥
Wowwwwww
Estou sem palavras. Está perfeito. Finalmente Dragões.
HOUSE OF THE DRAGON!!! ❤️🔥❤️🔥❤️🔥
I am hyped but unfortunately it looks very much unrealistic and fantasy-like. It doesn't have the same vibes as Game of Thrones, rather like The Witcher or Rings of Power. I guess they don't have the big budget anymore.
So excited
🔥"""Dracarys""" 🔥
Sooooo hyped 😆✨
Looks amazing!!!!
I think ye series khud ko dragon k naam se bech rahi hai kyoki isme 1% bhi GOT wala maja nhi dikh raha  Fir bhi jab dekhenge nhi tab tak pata kese chalega achi or buri ka☺️
Wasn't excited for this...... now I am

IT'S ABOUT TO GO DOWN!

Efsane geri döndü
More Battles, more Dragons and more Incest. Perfect!
Awesome work. This will become history. Let's hope it's not too late...🔥
الأقوى والأفضل والأعظم على الإطلاق 😍
Fire Will Reign 🔥
Choosing Doctor as one of main sroryline characters was a wrong choice
Looks cinematic! Looks way better than seasons 7 and 8.
aaaaaa! no le aflojes dragona!
"Have you never imagined your self on the iron throne?" RHAENYS THE QUEEN YOU ARE. YOU TELL HER THAT 😌🔥
Go remake season 8 then we'll talk
Haven't been hyped for a series that much for a long time, im glad to have Westeros back! 😍
I remember well my queen Daenerys or chain-breaking  mother of dragons 🔥🐉👑🙌💘I wish the actress a recovery from the crack operation
Woooooooooooow godddddd❤️‍🔥🥹
Looks way better than the Rings of Power more interesting not as expensive looks just cooler.  😎
The Age of House of the Dragon has begun, The return of the King of fantasy tv shows 🐉 ⚔️ 👑
blank slate, hope they don't fumble this as well
House Velaryon lets gooo 🌊🐍
Aaaaaaaaaaaa
I’m glad to see dragons 🐉 again
Loved the 🐉 trailer fire will reign🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Garbage.
I think HBO is the only platform which doesn't disappoint me till now... Exc GOT finale
.
I just googled "who is the showrunner for house of dragons", since its not the same people from last time, I may give this a try
Fire will reign for sure
Daemon and caraxes❤🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Que trailerrrrrrrr 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Hype
OMG IM CRYING FROM TEARS OF JOYYYY
AMAZING OMFG
The show looks very promising. I hope people watch it with a fresh mind.
Lets go ..can't wait
Reclaiming GOT’s glory 💯
Where is Aegon Targaryen? The civil war is between Rhaenyra and Aegon, the siblings.
This will have everybody on a chokehold every Sunday just like Game of Thrones did. I’m so excited 🔥🔥🔥
Looks awesome
The Targaryan armor looks awesome!!
I watched the first episode and it's disappointing
Isso ta incrivel
Rings of Power: (chuckles) I'm in danger!
Looks sick af, really hyped to see the Starks and Lannisters of this era
omfg, i cannot wait
Ok am sold on this
Epic trailer. Superb Music ❤️😭
Blood and Fire
DIOOSSS MIOOOO
Man cant wait for this show...when i saw the dragon i was like yeah this is what i want🥵🔥
0:39 & 1:54 Succession crossover confirmed
Im dying
This looks absolutely insane. RIP Ring of Power.
Let's hope this prequel will be a Better Call Saul instead of The Hobbit. Looks really promising. Rhaenyra and Alicent can be compared to Daenerys and Cersei.
No words! 😮 I'm into it.  Bring me the dragons. 🐲 Love from Nepal 🇳🇵
Me encanta! 😍🔥🐉
GOT fans our time has finally come!
🐉🔥🔥🔥❣️
What About Indian Audience 😢😢
Don't get too attached, everyone will die in the first season 🥲.
Everything looks absolutely stunning. This is a work of art in every imaginable way. The Dragons have arisen.
OMFG I LOVE YOU HOUSE OF THE DRAGON!!!!!!!!
HYPEEEEEE
CAN'T WAIT! Looks like another masterpiece on our doorstep
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
❤️
The dragons! 😱😱😱😱❤️
Thats why i prefered hbo over netflix to make an adaptation of the witcher 😔
Cautiously optimistic 🔥
Not me crying I’m so happy
Looks like a confusing mess. This series will ultimately be a letdown.
We will be watching.  This is absolute fire  And blood too if u know what i mean🔥🩸
Looking forward to it. When I first read about the Dance of the Dragons, I'd hoped a series of some sort would be based off of it.
The dragons are so mad 😈
It’s looks incredible
Похоже, что в противостоянии "The Rings of Power" и "House of the Dragon" побеждает последний. Выглядит интересно.
"War is afoot". Daemon Targaryen holding the jaws of his dragon is so epic- they are indeed the only men the gods gave the power to tame those beasts.
With fire and blood, I will take back what's mine🐉🔥🔥🔥🔥
Oh my God it's amazing 👏 😍
Why I am crying while watching this? 😭
0:50 just why xDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
The dragons are coming 🔥🔥🔥
OOOOHHH MY GODDDD🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
star wars at HBO would've been epic!!!

This is literally the life of Queen Elizabeth since she did change the rules of who takes the throne.
Can't wait to see this series 🔥
ITS AMAZING
“Our hearts remain as one.” “Our hearts were never one.” Alicent and Rhaenyra will turn from best of friends into the most bitter of enemies the realm has ever seen💚🖤🐉⚔️🛡👑
I thought this was canceled? Nvm looks epic
Ramin djawadi music 🤩😍
