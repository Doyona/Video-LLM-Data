I think that the Hasckak sisters are so talented. It will be best if they go to America's got talent ,show their talent and win a  million dollars
I'm surprised that Olivia kept the ballerina slipper that was my favorite part of the video.
D

If u read this comment, just remember that god gave us all one opportunity to be a child and a kid. If u still love toys even though 10 or higher just remember to keep on being your self. Don’t listen to others that judge you for playing with “baby” toys be your own self.
Remember all the true fun that you had

Red Hot Chili Peppers  Going Li   Some people say you hate me, I don't believe it's true, things that you're going through Some people say you hate me, I don't believe it's you, things that you're going through, Some people sad I pray for, No one you want to live, the eyes that once were his Some people sad I pray for, The way you want to live, the eyes you want to give  Some people say you played me, I don't care if it's true, I'm waiting here for you, Some people say you made it, I'm not afraid to know, when things are getting low Some people say you hate me, I don't believe it's true, things that you're going through Some people say you hate me, I don't believe it's you, things that you're going through

Jesus  Christ is coming back soon. He loves you dearly and calls for you to come back home to Him! that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.  He calls for repentance and belief in the Gospel. It’s time to fully surrender to Christ. But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well
I haven’t seen there videos since 2017! Olivias grown so much 😦😄 Edit: So has Sierra 😮

Türkler +1. As bayrakları as as.
United States:Olivia is fast grow up.She is 14,5 years old so teenager.Really,she is much old,now. Turkey:Olivia little kid too,now.Just she is 14,5 years old so she is most young,now too.
I think,Olivia's room was/is not most childish anywas.
United States:13 or 19 years is teenagers. Turkey:15 or 24 years is teenagers.

*Hey, to you reading* ... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” *www.soul.fish*
Cool 😎

BEST SONG IN THE WORLD
Olivia Is a really good painter
Hi i LOVE ALL OF UR SONGS AND VIDS♡
So big Olivia I look so pretty in your outfit and I love the girls in your video
This was such a good video!😊Honestly I'm so proud of you all for being such successful youtubers at such a young age. For 2 yrs I've been doing youtube but I don't have many subs.😂 Any tips? Btw I have no money for a camera, I'll never get a ring light until Christmas/my birthday, none of my family will help me record, I don't have a mic for audio, and I only have one instrument for music, a piano. Hope everyone reading has a good day/night.
Oui.tu me monque......
I love all of your vídeos😊

16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.  18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. John 3:16-18  Have a blessed day.

To the random person who is reading this You are a great person and when you grow up you might just be a celebrity you are a kind and intelligent person and stay safe during quarantine 🙂 ❤️
Who else missed their old songs ?
This is no lie, we will come across someone you don't like especially at school or work. You will have to put up with it. But you stay strong and ignore that one person you don't like. We all go through stuff like this, but we have to stay strong. Like I have been saying!!! We are beautiful, and smart and can do anything we put our own minds too. Remember that!❤️❤️❤️
Hey

Sierra : perfect for me Gracie : all on eyes on me maddison : when a girl likes a boy Olivia : glow they have growned so much😭😭😭😭😭
As we get older we change, and we do eventually have to get rid of some stuff, but that's just life. We all have a future, and if you work hard, and spend time with those you love, you will have a bright future! Always stay strong, and we can get through this Corona virus quicker. Appreciate everything in your life, you are you and that's okay. Thats what makes you who you are. If anyone is going through depression during this you are not alone. Talk to your family about it, or a consular. And remember you don't have to be anyone else, just be you!!! Because you are awesome!!! We are all human, we make mistakes. We learn from them. keep fighting through this, keep thinking positive and stay tough and strong! Raise your voice speak what you think, don't be afraid to hold back and don't let anyone bring you down!!! If you fall down get back up and go through the rest of your life. You are strong, tough, pretty, smart, creative, friendly, out-going. We are all of these things. You can accomplish more if you do more things and keep practicing. Stay strong! And remember all of this!!!❤️❤️❤️
I love this 😍 💯
Love you olivia 💖💖🥰🥰
Noooo....not the cupcake! 🙂 Cute video.

Heyyyy thereee
Hey I love your videos though I'm not like the first viewer. But I really appreciate your concepts and I want you to do a shout out in your videos. Please let me 💛💜
New music video and early omg
new post: my notification: 12 minutes late
In my own opinion, Olivia can keep her stuff if she really wanted to. Because they each hold memories of her life with her sisters, and sure she is growing up, and we get more social and less shy we are ilder now. Olivia if you are reading this, you are a pretty girl, and you can accomplish anything you put your mind to. I love your personality, and I love your sisters. You are lucky to have them as your sisters. Keep doing what you love! And stay strong! I love you guys!!!

Yes phones and there 10 literally I don’t understand how there parents let them I only have an iPad and I might get a laptop next year but I think that Im young because I was born in December literally almost evryone in my class is 10 or over but ummm yeah thank you and bye  Also thank you so much for the likes I really appreciate it I didn’t think my life was so interesting 😂 but thank you so much ❤️  Also I actually the youngest kid in my class
