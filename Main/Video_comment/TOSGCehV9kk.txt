it wasnt upamecanos fault
Who else is hear to watch kontae
Waiting for the Highlights from the second leg. Not up yet. So came here instead 😬😬
Love how they're slating Upamecano for a Mukiele mistake, even during the replay,thecommentator🤦‍♂️
It wasn’t even upamecano who made that mistake
Klopp got a positive Bilanz against german teams in european competetions:  2012/13 (ChampionsLeague) :  Borussia Dortmund vs Bayern Muenchen 1:2 (Final)  2015/16 (Europe League) : FC Augsburg vs FC Liverpool 0:0 FC Liverpool vs FC Augsburg 1:0 (round of 32)  Borussia Dortmund vs FC Liverpool 1:1 FC Liverpool vs Borussia Dortmund 4:3 (quarterfinal)  2017/18 (ChampionsLeague): TSG Hoffenheim vs FC Liverpool 1:2 FC Liverpool vs TSG Hoffenheim 4:2 (play-off)  2018/19 (ChampionsLeague): FC Liverpool vs Bayern Muenchen 0:0 Bayern Muenchen vs FC Liverpool 1:3 (round of 16)  2020/21 (ChampionsLeague): RB Leipzig vs FC Liverpool 0:2 FC Liverpool vs RB Leipzig ???  Now he wants to leave FC Liverpool and might become DfB Manager.
The way Liverpool have been playing at Anfield  in the PL, my money is on Leipzig to make a comeback
now what? get beat by Everton - im ashamed
european royalty
Didn't anyone else realise that it wasn't umpamecano who made the mistake?
I didn’t know upemacano was mukiele
It wasn't Upamecano who made the mistake for the first goal, it was mukiele
Chelsea above liverpoo in the table now and frank got sacked so how is he still in a job? Klopp Out, Out Out Out! Moyes In!!
Im convinced salah and mane dont get along 😂
Islam is the truth. Read the Quran
Alison plays better in Champions League.
The 2 divers score again!!
I wonder why they thought it was Upamicano's mistake 🤔
Upamencano and klostermann costed the game
Liverpool a bit lucky
Don’t they realise that upamecano wasn’t making those mistakes and that they were the wrong black guy😂
Just goes to show that only city and liverpool  are good enough to win the champions league out the English  teamss left
Beating Leipzig  not for everyone  is  it man utd
Well done liverpool 2 mistakes from defenders nice finish mane and salah leipzig get out of the champions
Salahs left foot low sense of gravity reminds me of peak robben
2:09 this should remind everyone how great Alison really is! Don’t judge a player off 2 Games. Look hard he must adjust his hand 2:20
Good game. 2 teams trying to play football and score. Unlike the slo-mo, turgud premier league where the object seems to be not to concede and keep the ball in ya own half. Money for old rope.
Liverpool is the best
It’s sad how they rely on two horrible errors from Leipzig to score
Who else hates Liverpool
God Haphening to everyone who didn't say first
Can we just appreciate Mane’s acrobatics here? 😆 1:50
That was Mukiele mistake not upamacano for the second agreed!
Henderson is not liverpool quality
At last nice to see Liverpool playing well again felt so sorry for them in the last few months
Should’ve been 3-0 that ball was 1mm on the line so still in play
These guys are the worst commentators ever...their voices are super annoying yo.
Words cant explain how much i hate liverpool.. GGMU!!
Becker what a beast
The ones who made Liverpool win aren’t Mane and Salah, it’s Sabitzer and Upomecano
Great game. Manes goal was class. I think Bring on Everton YNWA
1:18 lol
In the middle of global pandemic, why are knock out matches not being held in neutral location as one-legged matches?
Two mistakes, two goals, classic.
Everyone blames upamencano for the 2nd goal how sad
Liverpool are finished if it wasn't for them 2 defensive mistakes they wouldn't have scored . They will lose at Annfield mark my words
@3:06 "BOOM"
Salah 118 Goals now for Liverpool Equlling the great Ian St John
We get knocked down,but we get up again  as the song goes.YNWA
This is boring  🥱
waaaaaaay they finally won something again
Should the title not read RB Leipzig give reds timely win?
Good luck bayern with upamencano
Get in there Liverpool
We will not sleep alone tonight
steve mcmanaman is awful
Big Shane duffy playing at the back for RB there 🇬🇧🇬🇧
So cool
Salah smokes packys toenails
Mane and Salah clearly don't get along anymore as they did before hence why they aren't playing to assist each other they just wanna score.
That first goal for Liverpool should have been counted, as part of the ball was still on the line. Just watch the replay from all angles.
Yes libpool
From the highlights this game could have gone either way.I think it's too early to say Liverpool are back.
For once Kieth, a team played football against Liverpool and didn't park the bus.
I'm confused,hasn't upamecano already signed for bayern?
That goalie in the goal 😆
2:00 the balls still in should of been 3
So they either do really good or really bad. It’s like flipping a coin each game and it landed badly the previous 4...
Looks like sabitzer already knew that salah was gonna score.
Leipzig defence was poor , feel bad for the attackers
First goal should have stood as whole ball not over line. Doesnt var look at this ?
RB Leipzig defenders = 'Oh no, oh no, oh no no no no'
1:08 I guess the ref wanted to play aswell
So good
Curtis Jones had a great performance, hope he starts every game
How embarrassing is it to keep confusing players because of their skin colour? Even with a replay they couldn't see it wasn't Upamecano. Terrible
Liverpool have been due a dip in form, hopefully they can get back to winning ways now.
love how they spend like 20s calling out upamecano for mukiele's mistake
As a Liverpool fan, if we play like that against Everton then I'll be happy
Are the commentators braindead ?Like even after the replay they said it was upamecano’s fault
Black Player: Makes mistake White Commentators: What a mistake by Upamecano
The commentator should’ve said “Bobby Firmino” instead of “Roberto Firmino” :/
its mad that they didnt show either of the sujood celebrations
Our keeper, who has made a few mistakes lately, kept a few out, rb are a gud side, 4 one so young, and god forbid our recent home curse does not come to hauunt us, we had to get get beat at home sooner or later, let's hope we are focused to go in as though it's the final, who agrees that we're missing virgil, our attack game is 2nd to none, but our defence on counter attacks is the reason we're missing virgil, the reason our keeper is making errors, with virgil there, the keeper had nothing to save, and were missing the 12th man, 1day soon I hope we'll get bk to the terrace, ynwa
Why are they keep saying Upemecano’s mistake?? It was clearly not him who made the mistake
I hope this good trend continues 💜
Upemacano didn’t even run that fast, the first camera movement makes him look faster... he’s actually running no faster than the other defender
Don't get hyper farmer clue supporters it's 1st leg
Ynwa Liverpool forever
Wtf ? Both goals should be looked at by the fraud squad. What a sham 😞 Jammy scouse
Nice to see salah back smiling after scoring
The commentators celebrating the goals aa though liverpool created it with some good football rather than a mistake. But when liverpool makes a mistake like against leceister they make it obvious it was due to an error
Liverpool should have signed huang hee chan instead of minamino
3:57 the yell😂
That was Mukiele for the Mane goal not Upamecano. He had a poor night nonetheless.
that was a performance that we used to do .
Liverpool are way better in the champions league they have way more confidence in the champion league
and who is clapping? such a manipulation
I’m a chelsea fan and I always love to see the English teams do good in the champions league well done liverpool !!
3:27 that’s not Upamecano fault, low IQ from Carragher.
Find it hard to believe that people say this was an great performance both goals were quite literally handed to them.
683,000
680,000th
RIP people that watched this game instead of the Barca game
0:19 if he has touched it is what a save!!
Most biased commentary. These 2 commentate EVERY Liverpool gane.
Upemecano is worth how much?
That ball was in
Mane was absolutely 🔥🔥
Played a Rb that was awful.....
Saleh is great but another club will come along at some point and poach him
Beckers redemption game
The moment Salah was 1 on 1 with the keeper my heart was in my mouth. I needed him to score to win £110 and he didn’t disappoint. YNWA!
Is no one talking about all of salahs goals?!?!?!
Dont rule out Liverpool winning this Champions League. On their day still a great team.
McManaman blaming 2nd goal on Upamecano.... how has he got a job still? he wasn’t even the player who missed it.
Jesus is coming soon He loves u and died for u pls turn to Him
Wait liverpool won a game?
Upamecano has insane pace to nearly get back at mane
Back in business 😜
Not Upamencano’s mistake. BT’s commentators are embarrassing.
Liverpool are so bad
Alisson must of stepped up his game
Are Liverpool really back to there best after 1 win ..
Looks a fix this game 🙄
Imagine if rb  leipzig do a comeback in second leg against Liverpool
Things look abit tetchy between Salah and Mane😬😬
Wow Liverpool has played really well in big champions league games
3:36 that wasn't upamecano tho
Starting to think that we LOVE playing against german teams
My brother was like what a pass when salah scored
Upamecano never made a mistake for the second goal I swear
Ball wasn’t fully out of play for Firmino goal when Mané cut back. Obviously difficult for the linesman to make that decision but with the technology available the out of bounds decision should’ve been overturned and ought to have been 3 - 0 tie over.
“A mistake by upamecano ???” Hold on... could it be...
First
Looks like Only English teams stack their defence up, parking the bus so LFC can’t wack a few goals in
My ears need an exorcism after listening to that
ভহ,কহ্যজ্যহভ💯
2 mistakes 2 goals ... Liepzig should win
I love Liverpool lol
2:04 that ball wasn’t actually out lmao
Salah gets  sooo much hype even though it was an easy goal
Who's just here for the comments on the keeper's head getting stuck in the net 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 think I had to rewind it like 10 times and still find it hilarious
the slip and slide
Anyone realise that the PSG vs Barcelona highlights are double the time of the Liverpool vs RB Leipzig 🤨
I love Salah, but MANE's ball control is OUT OF THIS WORLD.
It wasn’t actually upamencano mistake 2nd goal
These commentators need a slap upamacano didn’t make the mistakes for the second goal he was the player who tracked back it was mukiele that made the mistake. BT sport have a word. The commentary team are constantly making mistakes
why they keep saying Upamecano made the mistake?
1:56 never knew tom holland was a linesman
Liverpool win yeah
Nice
Salah 7 games in the champions league and 7 goals in the champions league
Chances of Upemecano to Liverpool must have just diminished tonight lol
What was Mo indicating as he went down the tunnel?
i dont think that went out look at the ball in speed 0.25
mad how klopp can travel to germany to play leipzig, but not so he can attend his mother’s funeral
1:50 that pass from Mane was 10x better than Bruno's whole career...
if wasn’t upamencano tho
With manes goal if that happened in Turkey everyone would say its match fixing...
Am I the only one that doesn't fully see the ball go out for the disallowed goal?
McManaman... King of stating the bleeding obvious.
Crisis, what Crisis? Could have been more than the two.
Big respect to..   Mo Salah  Curtis Jones  And Angelino 👏
Commentator saying salahs goal was quality let be honest it was handed on a plate to him there just saying if he missed that chance then there’s something wrong 😂
Well done to Klopp and his boys, a solid performance and Mane gave another super performance
Subtle racism by the BT Sports commentators…
We all know liverpool wouldn't have won without those mistakes
Im sorry these commentators are literally Liverpool fan TV
2 gifted goals
Amateurish commentation from Macca as always...
Weres all them haters saying we would lose then??
Number 16 did the Steven Gerrard
The commentary was dreadful. Biased on the first goal, it wasn't a 'great goal'. The second goal was a mistake by Mukilele not Upamemcano, how can they not tell the difference, the scouser then goes on even more saying it was another mistake by the main man Upamemcano. No insight given, they were only reacting to what was happening and thinking on the spot.
I know they scored the goals, but both were gifts, defenders should be credited 😂
Dayot Upamacano wasn't the player who made the mistake it was Mukiele
They sit there and slate upamacano when he doesn’t do anything wrong it’s clearly Mukiele
Why is Liverpool mainly Allison doing well in the cl but in the prem they haven’t one a game
Upamecano didn’t make the mistake for the second goal...
Whos better: Like shaw  Comment robertson
Bro united against racism, but they are saying for manes goal that upamecano made a mistake but it was clearly mukiele, given upamecano was the one who was charging after the ball
Get your facts right BT that wasnt Upemecano`s mistake
I'm happy for them, but this just means that it'll give Liverpool a morale boost...
They said upanemacno made a mistake at the mane goal but it was kunate 😭😭
This is the start of Liverpool’s season ..ynwa
I think klopp is selling the league games to be honest
Probably go on and win it skitzo side they are.
liverpool gifted the win
Mane breaths Steve mcmanaman: ohh that was a cool, composed breathing pattern.
Mane’s acrobatics were on point that match, especially the disallowed goal
Is sabitzer actually good all I see is him making mistakes giving away goals
I was drinking a can of monster while I was watching this match
2:30 Salah forgot that there are no spectators in the stadium 😂😂
Both goals from big mistakes at the back, but it will lift our confidence.
Was any apology made on air for "Fletch" & Mcmanaman mistaking Mukiele & Upemacano?
Good luck to Bayern who will he having upmaernco
The Leipzig and Salzburg kits look the same lol
professional!
Wasn’t upemacano with the mistake. He’s definitely chasing back when mane scores and the other defender is still on the floor.
Mukiele must’ve watching the Leicester v Liverpool highlights. No way he tried to clear that accidentally 😂
To this day the commentators still think the second goal was upemacnos fault
Liverpool fans crawling back out of their caves again after beating a side who’s top goal scorer has 4 goals and is a LB 😂
If the first disallowed goal was Manchester United or City then it would of counted 😝
With Liverpools record at home this season I'm not convinced this is over.   We have VAR in England To screw Liverpool over.
Alisson knows that he can only mess up in premier league but not UCL..
That's not upumecano's mistake lol
We may have won 2-0 but after we went 2 up we looked shaky. It’s like we couldn’t play a pass, we lost the ball multiple times. I’m happy for the win but we still need to improve.
Great win for the team tonight let’s hope we play like that in the league on Sunday against the blues
No one mentioning Alissons Great Performance!
Leipzig looked good but shot themselves in the foot over and over defensively.
How was the second goal caused by a upamecano mistake
I thought they lost
Gifted it too Liverpool
Salah just has that smarter striker iq.
About time we won a game
Second goal wasn't upacanemo mistake
Allison is trash in the premier league but in the champ league, he’s ok
Allison went from Sunday League to Edwin Van de sar 😂
Anyone know who Everton have got in Europe this week?
x2 mistakes by Leipzig
FK RB
Allison has remembered how to play football again. Nice.
Finally, we won a game!!!
Ozan kabak perfect guy 😍
Two defensive errors, else it would have finished 0-0
King sahla
Leipzig did not play a striker in the lineup when they had 2 on the bench and they were playing against a team with no defence, is this RB Leipzig manger actually stupid?
Very well done to Liverpool
The way the keeper launched himself into the back of the net😂
Confidence is slowly coming back
'gives reds'?
The mistake wasn’t made by Upamecano...Upamecano is the one running after Mane...The player who did the mistake was down
How they blame upemacamo for the second goal he was the guy recovering
Was not expecting that. Expecting more defensive howlers from Liverpool and the reverse scoreline. Half a foot in the next round hopefully. Good for the confidence keeping a clean sheet in Germany.
Make sure u comment on this comment about leizpigs defence
Commentator is a huge Liverpool fan
Anyone else fed up with these annoying g commentators
Jeez Leipzig, just hand them the win 😳
United fans quiet tonight. !!! Scumbags!!!! 🤫🤫🤫🤫😂😂
Lool blaming a defender for defensive partners mistakes 😅 typical. Dayot can be great he needs a coach to work on making less errors and positional awareness
Upamecano didn't even make the mistake if anything with acceleration like that he wasn't far off catching mane after mukiele clearly made the error and its mad that even with the replays the commentators still mistook Upamecano for mukiele
How the fk did Leipzig miss so many chances like this could of been a 2-2 game
So happy Liverpool won after two very disappointing performances against Man city and Leicester Salah strikes again and no doubt Mane is a straight up beast of a player well done boys YNWA 👏👏 .. Bless up .✌📿⚽️
Gulacsi : *"today I am ball"*
All I can see is people talking bout how they got the players name wrong like he's joining there team or something big deal 😂😂
United fans where u at now?
Gulacsi almost got sent to the gulag by robbo
Good effort Leipzig
2:21 this is what I mean ffs why don’t goalkeepers see how dead Alison is, he was on the ground and he looked up aswell. Such a rubbish shot from a proffesional footballer.
Salah has been on fire 🔥🔥🔥 1 season wonder 🤣🤣
How can they say Upamecano was at fault for the 2nd goal not once but twice loooooool🤣🤣🤣🤣 to them all us black brothers look the same haha😆😆😆😆 Leizpig tho use had one job man juss do to Liverpool what u did to United😤😤 n beat them too but no ffs🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️ u had to give up two sloppy goals through mistakes inih smh😪😪
Commentators are on a mad one how are they getting players wrong
Upamecano smashing the ball into the net after Mane scored like he hasn’t just sealed a free pass into the CL every season until he leaves Bayern looooool
It was not even upamencano it was mukiele
Liverpool without Salah this season, would be fighting for the top half of the f*cking table
Mo salah we are champions and we will fight like champions until the very end. What a legend who seen mo salah defending?
The only reason we won this is because RB were sloppy. Both goals came from poor mistakes, and the disallowed goal too. If they sure up and come back prepared, they could cause us serious problems.
lucky
Last
4:00 so awkward 😬
Poor upamencano, wasn’t even him that did the mistakes
It wasnt even upamecano who made the mistake for leipzig it was mukiele lmao
That’s more like it!!!😎
Upamecano looks like a future Man Utd player = terrible at defending 🤣
cringing at the commentators saying it was Upamecano
2:25 sabitzer knows what coming 😂😂
Upermecano sounds like the posh Lego set they sold in the 80’s...
“It’s a mistake for Umpancano” erm no it wasn’t  both useless commentators naming the wrong player 🤦🏻‍♂️
Leipzig just need better attackers their defensive is good but they sold Werner n bought no one
It wasn't Upamencanu who made the mistake Did no one see how rapid he was as well when trying to recover
Awesome game, ball for the first disallowed goal didn't go out imo
Commentators literally get paid to say what’s happening in a game, and they constantly get players names wrong and even after watching replays they don’t correct their mistakes
love to see klopp repping the wenger coat
Man I cant wait till upamecano is with us (Bayern)
2:22 Salah goal  3:07 Mané goal
Is it just me or does the game look fast forward?
❤️
salah
mane
We are European elite 🔴
2:59 good choice of words there pal perfectly describes him
Bayern just refunded the 38mil for Upamecano
Imagine Liverpool lost to Leipzig
4:25 Is Orban wearing lipstick lol
I’ll be taking the 1,000 comment
Upamencano is overrated. He was rubbish v utd too
I predict RB Leipzig to score 3 goals at Anfield
3:12 racism that was not upamecano  Even moment later they still thought it was him
Liverpool will win European Cup
Why was Liverpool's first goal ruled out if the ball didn't go out?
Upamecano is such a liability
So your telling me the only two goals liverpool scored are from mistakes from the defenders????🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Unpopular but true opinion, the whole entire liverpool team is overrated except salah van dijk Robertson and Fabinho
Imagine the champions of England not being able to score more goals than rashford who was a substitute against Leipzig
Upemecano extremely overrated. Time after time gets exposed.
Well played Liverpool much much better but still work to do in the 2nd leg despite the 2-0 lead
Some assist for the 1st goal😂
Hopefully Allison is back to his good ways, great job today
This guys are so dumb upamecano wasn't the one the mistake it was mukiele watch the game properly please 🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️
Saw Upamencano play against United and then Liverpool now and I really don't get the hype at all, he looks terrible!!
Football so mad Liverpool no where near the best but mo salah 24 goals unreal
🐐
Finally that is Liverpool that the world knows. Still not at the top level everybody use too. But good performance
Do the commentators not know that mukiele isn't upamencano?
Why does it look like it’s being played in 2x speed
Robertson's shot reminds me of Mo Salah goal in 2018 against man city
Great first goal from Liverpool? It was a blunder from Leipzig
Carragher sucking Salah off like he scored a worldie
We played brilliant from the first minute. Kabak MOTM for me he was brilliant and also jones
Мяч не вышел полностью. Это легко увидеть при втором повторе.
Two goals from two mistakes. I wouldn’t get to excited
it was mukiele that made the mistake wtf the commentators tripping
Curtis jones had a good game, well underated.
Ugly win
Why was this game played in Budapest?
Gifted goals there
Mané capitalised on an error not made by Upamecano but no 22. How the commentators mix the two up is beside me.
Great goal?! It was put on a plate for him
But they are not heading for Anfield
When the chips are down?
After alisson last mistakes it's good to see he hasn't made any and made some great saves in this game
Still despair that mcmanaman is commentating.
So much for the Liverpool melt down, Alison was his brilliant best, from a neutral
Kabak was solid tonight 💪🏼
Shut up Steve Mcmanaman, i have spoken
Great to see Klopp fist pumping again
Here for all the haters 😂😂😂
Why did he say the first goal was a 'great goal'? It was a complete gift 😂
Upamecano didn’t make that mistake that commentary has annoyed me now
Upamencano big mistake when it was mukiele smh
Lol it wasn’t upamecano fault for the 2nd goal, it was Mukiele
upamecano is absolute dogshite   ppl keep raving about how good he is  ive lost count how many times ive seen him give the ball away and silly mistakes he is no better than lindelof
56 thousandth :)
Well Barca gonna have bad night like Leipzig
A great goal for all the right reasons? If Liverpool concede that goal, McManaman would've said how atrocious it was defensively. Because that's literally all it was.
"Mistake from Upamecano" That's Mukiele I swear. 3:11
Rip rttf klostermann owners
Why do BT and Sky insist on having this cringe fake crowd noise as default.  Why do they assume most people don't want authentic sound? It is so annoying
Alisson showing his worth today made me happy as a Liverpool Fan. He better keep it up though especially against Everton in the Merseyside Derby.
I hated when Upamecano made that mistake for liverpool's 2nd
Only Liverpool can go on a losing streak and then win in Europe like nothing happened
It’s only a win against a team from a car manufacturers league haha
Upamecano was terrifying tonight... I’ve watch Leipzig a few times and they’ve never kept I clean sheet that I remember
I wont be shocked if Leipzig go to anfield for the second leg and pull it off! There still a dangerous side man with a dangerous young gifted tactical manager!
The ball doesnt go out
I don’t know how they can still play the away goal rule when clearly home is exactly the same as away: empty
No Salah is world class! Supreme footballer man wow!
Bayern watching Upamecano tonight and wondering if they can unsign him
Think it was unfair for the commentators to blame every single mistake Leipzig made on Upamencano just because he’s signed a big contract with Bayern, 2nd goal was literally nothing to do with him .. made a few mistakes but he’s still only young
Why was it played in Hungary ?
Hee Chan should’ve scored 🤣
This just shows how competitive the PL is. Burnley and Brighton put on better performances against Liverpool recently..
Calm down liverpool fans u ain't winning it JS
Upamecanos started playing for bayern his first aim is to get Leipzig out of the ucl
wait why was upamecano getting blaimed for the 2nd goal? It was Mukiele no?
I’m glad bayern signed upamecano now 😆
Fabulous assist to Salah 😁 pass played perfectly 😂
Goal 1 - 2:27 Goal 2- 3:10
Bayern looking for the receipt for upemcano
The ball didn't go out when Mane got an assist? No surprises that VAR didn't even look at it though.
Liverpool finish.........
Will Liverpool survive in the round of 16 leg2
Regardless of league form, Liverpool are a different animal in the Champions League, from a neutral.
Psg are though...does that mean liverpool are too im so confused or is it similar to lasr year?
Not a upamaceno mistake it was the other guy
Our defence suffering still unfortunately.
This is why PL is the best league, no defence in Bundesliga at all
He said mistake by upamecano when it was mukelele
Why were the commentators gassing up salah’s goal so much, it was literally passed straight to him and the defender in front slipped, would’ve been an awful miss
Finally a win for Liverpool
3:05 I think the commentator made a mistake when saying upamecano made that mistake which lead to mane’s goal
Commentator needs to take another look
If only Minamino got to play against his old club 😪
It wasn’t Upamecano who made the mistake, it was Konate
Good to see them mistaking mukiele’s mistake for mane’s goal with upamecano
The commentators are slating Upemecano for the second goal, even on the replays.  It wasn't even him that made the mistake.
YEESSSS!!!!🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴
forgot what winning felt like. What a performance!
Any one like robbie savage laying into wrong player 🤣🤣
Yes Liverpool is back! Love champions league! We are Liverpool. This means more. YNWA
Champions League is all they can concentrate on now everything else is out of reach
Gulasci was actually class. Underrated keeper
Not a bad game , Mo Salah was sharp today...good to see Mane getting on the score sheet.  But still, Allison keeps playing risky keeping and should stay focused not to leave the goal wide open and choose better when to make the correct decisions .I believe  it would better for the defence, goal difference and  win ratio.  Clean sheet. Happy.
Salah is world class
Great signing for bayern!! Lol
LFC 👏👏
Upamacano is so overated he makes countless errors as a centre back
Wang's a decent player, seen him a couple of previous games and looks good.
Why always spoil the scores in the thumbnail?
People waiting for us to slip but we grabbed that win! 💪🏼
That was Mukiele not Upamecano lmao
Needed that!
👏🔥👍🔴
Wait a minute how come Alison is good in the champions league and bad in the premier league
Who was the scouse commentator? He was lame.  5mins later (my brother explains it was only Steve Mcmanaman) Still find it hard to hear nothing but empty pointless attempts at phrases that just state the obvious. Even from celebrated players.
Liverpool getting lucky as per usual. Trent again looking awful in defence. If he starts in defence for England in the Euros then they won't get out of the groups.
MADE up for JURGEN tonight lost his mom and so called supporters called for JURGEN to be sacked Show this man the respect he deserves after all he won the Fifa world cluub champions and the champions LEAGUE and after 30 years made us PREMIER LEAGUE WINNERS  JURGEN has done everything for Liverpool fc RESPECT PEOPLE well done JURGEN tonight and the Redmen we looked hungry tonigt YNWA,para
Lpool play rubbish but get gifted 2 goals 😂😂😂
A great performance
BAYERN FANS ALREADY HAVING NIGHTMARES OVER THEIR NEW SIGNING UPEMACANO!
Subscribe to my channel if upamecano was poor today.
Based on this, Nagelsmann is massively overhyped because Leipzig were shockingly bad in terms of how open they were. Liverpool have lost all confidence in the Premier League where any little setback badly disrupts their focus atm, i,e., see recent Leicester, Man City games, etc.. but what does Nagelsmann do? He sets up his team in a manner so bad defensively that Liverpool to exploit and get a lovely pick me up. I bet Klopp couldn't believe his luck.
Upamecano yet another hype. Guess bundesliga can make any defender look world class. He flopped against Man Utd and flopped today again
Is thiago useless?
Leipzig aren’t the same without Werner.
Apparently every black player is upamecano 🙄🙄🙄
“Yet a number of mistakes” 👀
RTTF wijnaldum better go up in price
When the keeper got his head through the net and had to get himself out 🤣🤣
Wow... Leipzig don’t deserve this, played really well but got super unlucky today.
Not a Liverpool fan but that disallowed goal was pure class from Mané should’ve stood for being so sick
Liverpool needed a good night 🙂
Guess it was battle of the defence and for the 1ST TIME Livepools was not the worst
These commentators low-key always mixing up these black players ffs 🤣🤣🤣
I feel sorry for upamencano getting stick for mukieles mistake
Alisson what a save
Mane 🇸🇳❤️
Mohamed Salah is one of Liverpool's legends, every match is a top scorer
Lets be honest, Liverpool this season is slacking. both goals were mistake from leipzig.
Very happy with the result.YNWA.
Henderson can't keep playing in defence, he doesn't have the acceleration to keep up with really quick strikers and he nearly cost Liverpool twice.
Love how they're slating Upamecano for a Mukiele mistake, even during the replay
Rode there luck there.
Sweet dreams Everyone
Upamecano is one of the most overrated players in world football
To the hayters this is klopp and the boys have still got it all it takes is a good run tilll the end of season  next season the boys will be back to full strength.
Liverpool are back to winning ways
Different team in Europe are Liverpool premiership has gone another European cup to add to the collection!!!
Liverpool been very lucky!!!  All goal scored after silly mistake!
That commentators don’t even know what player they talking about 😂😂😂😂
Upamacano overrated in my opinion
people who watched this instead of barca psg punching the air rn
Salah and Mane doesn’t want to assist each other...
That was 3:08 Mukiele not Upamecano! Bloody hell man! They don't even look alike and they have their name and number on their back. Stupid commentator!
Thank god - Alisson has stopped wearing his trousers 😂
rttf klosterman owners punching the air right now
RB Leipzig have Conceded 9 Goals against premier league teams this season
Any black Leipzig player = Upamecano, according to BT Sport.
Upamecano probably thinking he's already playing for Bayern.
This puts a big smile on my face 😁😁😁😁
Salah too bayern
Liverpool put two balls and one keeper in the back of the net 😂
🙏
It's good to see Liverpool fans dreaming again.
Mazaa ah gaya!!!
Boo!! Liverpool rubbish 🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮
Leipzig proving again what an absolute farmers league it is
Mcmannaman got confused twice lol upemaecano didn’t make the mistake
Supporting Liverpool is such an emotional rollercoaster. I love it🤩🤩🤩 YNWA
Wasn’t even Upemencanos mistake lmao
We kept a clean sheet 🥲
Upamencano’s acceleration after Mukiele’s mistake is insane
Glad Liverpool didn't loose
Good to see Mane back on the scoresheet. Seems as if in the recent games in any competition, the players with goal droughts have been scoring haha. Werner, Auba now Mane lol
There coming back
3:12 mistake from upamecano but actually it’s mukiele
That's the Liverpool that I know.. character, confidence and pouncing on any mistakes by the opposition. Well done lads. 👍
Big L to the people that watched this game
Feel bad for anyone who missed psg Barca for this
Wasnt even Upemecanos fault for that second goal, how can they not see that. He will be the best CB in the world.
I’m glad I didn’t watch this match 😂
Liverpool were lucky with the two mistakes both leading in goals. Klopp deserves this though after what he’s been through
How was the second goal Upamecano’s fault?? Steve McManaman is a terrible commentator 😂
Kabak >>> Upamacano
This is what happens when we don’t play a proper no.9 like poulsen or sorloth. Played nkunku as a false no.9 and didn’t really threaten the whole match
It wasn't Upamecano it was Mukiele
the commentators like to big up liverpool a bit too much at this point
Leipzig are so overrated. United beat them 5-0. The second match was a gift from our defence it doesn't count 😭.
Idiots don’t realise their mistake in blaming Upamecano for the goal even after the replay shows it wasn’t him.
Was upcameno the cause of the second goal?
3:10 why are the commentators saying upamecano its clearly mukiele and  upamecano is clearly running back🤔🤔
3:11 wasn’t even upamancano
Some serious Knob-jockeys in the comments section tonight. Imagine what they'd be like if Liverpool were to go on and win the CL??? 😂 😂 😂
My favourite part of watching Liverpool games is watching mane get pissed when Salah doesn't try assist
I'd like a word with the plastic imbeciles spreading roumers that Klopp's job was at risk. Total MORONS!!!!!
This really the team that knocked United out of the Champions League? 🤔🤣
Leipzig had enough chances to win that game - still worrying from Liverpool, but hopefully they can kick on from this
Shalom
Finally
Defensive errors involving Liverpool, must be contagious.
Congratulations to all rttf wijnaldum holders
Bayern M. Crying after buying the defender. 🤣
Upamecano wasn’t the one who made the mistake for the 2nd goal
Is mukiele on crack?
In Klopp we trust, let's get the job done!! YNWA🔴
Curtis Jones looks so good
3:34 Upemacano jeopardising his champions league run with Leipzig knowing he’s gonna be winners of the champions league next season with Bayern.
these commentators are washed
It wasn't umpamcano who made the mistakes, lol. It was the RCB
Happy for Klopp he's been given a lot of criticism by so called fans saying Klopp out. Not always the manager's fault the players have to perform on the pitch. Hopefully that win will get us back on track and give the team some needed confidence YNWA
I don't get why Liverpool are so tragic in the Premier League and winning away with a Champions League semi finalist
Alexander-Arnold + Lamptey + Jones + Bellingham + Smith-Rowe + Foden + Grealish + Saka + Sancho + Hudson-Odoi + Greenwood = England, Euro 2024 winners.
2:27 Sabitzer already knew it was a goal before Salah shot🤣
If that Robertson shot had gone in tho 😍
btw that second goal was on mukiele not upamecano
Lol even bad teams in the prem be smashing other European clubs shows the level English football is at 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Liverpool incredibly lucky yet again. Not seen a defensive error like that for along time let alone 2 in one game
Come on commentary team sort it out. it was mukiele not Upamecano who messed up for the 2nd goal.  Amateurish    error with the Commentary and defending.
Great 2ndhalf fc
good result but lucky with goals hopefully start of a winning run
Liverpool score from 2 defensive mistakes  Everyone in the comments : Liverpool will win the UCL
liverpool are class
Brilliant game for us
Huge win for Liverpool, maybe they can carry on this form into the league and maybe even qualify for Europa league next season...
He looks good for Leipzig Hwank
Slipamecano
People saying that Liverpool were lucky because Leipzig made defensive mistakes don't understand that Liverpool forced those mistakes and capitalised on them.
Love my team ...loved that performance,  great response,  could this competition be our saviour this season ?  YNWA ......At the end of the storm theres a golden sky 👊👊👊
Who's waiting for psg v barca highlights
Upamecano was given a career by Fifa his decision making is horrendous
Goal denied by the post. Roy: That's its job.
It was mukiele that made the mistake on the second goal what were the commentators saying
I just love Nkunku's name.
Are the front 3 back?
Huh? Upamecano? Lord I guess we all look alike ffs BT....
How are Liverpool losing at Anfield to burnley and Brighton but get a clean sheet win against Leipzig 🤦‍♂️🤣I love football
Since liepzig weren't home do these goals count as away goals?
Upamecano running after Mane like his life was on the line😂
3:11 lol overrated
Please stop subbing on shakiri everytime he comes on we lose composure...
Where’s the BARCA VS PSG highlights at? Why’s BT sport so slow????
Had that eairly change from Leipzig gone in it would have been a different game but fair play to Liverpool for showing character and taking there chances.
4:23 is that lipstick or a bloody mouth? lol
Great performance. Kabak for 20 years old looks decent
Slip..........slip
the 2nd goal wasnt even upmencano that slipped xD
Dogs - woof  Cats - meow Idiots - first Absolute spastics - second
118 Goals for Mo Salah in 3.5 Seasons. Averaging 34 Goals a season.🤯 Unreal.
3:12 "mistake by upamecano" it was mukiele but ok
How did upamecano make a mistake for the second goal
The commentator needs to learn that konate and upamecano are 2 different players...
Who's watching the highlights to this because they most definitely didn't watch this over Barca v PSG
Salah is unstoppable
What on earth was that Leipzig defence?
What a game, well deserved
Massive win mentally for Liverpool, let’s hope they carry the momentum forward in Europe, and in the league
We need the likes of Keita back quick, we went down a gear when we took off Thiago and Firmino, OX needs to improve more
Hopefully that's the start of a run. Kabak was great today. Would like to now see Davies eased into the team to get Hendo back into midfield. We still lack his quality intensity and direction in there.   Hopefully Jota and Keita are fit for the second leg. We move 🔴🔴
Bayern after seeing this Upamecano performance: Wheres the receipt?
And people say klopp needs a rest....
Seems as if that Leicester game was a wake up call. Great performance today, I hope we can keep it up like this and focus on the champions league. YNWA 🔴
Loool these guys were adamant that the second goal was upamecano😂😂
❤❤❤
Apparently Upamecano is better than Alaba
It took liverpool 2 bullshit goals to win. They'll be lucky to progress past the quarters
well it was just not Upamachano was it
It wasn't upamecano 😂😂😂
The ball went out
Jones is a calm, cool figure
Wasn’t upamecano that made the mistake to mane’s goal😂
The mistake for the 2nd wasn’t even Upamecano... these commentators just slated him for no reason.
Hi to the rival fans who couldn’t wait to banter in the comment section🙋‍♂️
Bayern Munich on the phone to Leipzig as we speak.
It is guaranteed that Liverpool are playing well and go to the next round. I really want leipzig to win
And they compared ali to karius and ederson
Alison was unreal tonight. They must've booted Adrian out of training.
Incoming rivals crying
Alisson has truly redeemed himself tonight, some insane saves
Feel a bit sorry for Sabitzer for the first goal. Head in the hands as soon as Salah got the ball and raced into the box.
Gulacsi launching himself into the back of the net was just beautiful 👌🏻
Announce Barcelona vs PSG
We Aston Villa be these Leipzig
Salah playing on the right scores with his left, Mane playing on the left scores with his right - YNWA
has anyone seen a barca fan? im looking 4 1
What a performance
What a dummy from the ref at 1:08 great counter attack.
Here before 10k veiws
The mistake for the 2nd goal wasn't umpamecano, it was mukiele
Psg- Barca waiting room
City or bayern winning this years champions league, United for the Europa league
Get in there as that for my team of Liverpool where they had everything just as under control against Leipzig from the first leg tonight in the round of 16 through the UEFA Champions League in top form
I just don’t see the hype around upamecano in any of the games I’ve watched of him. Kabak outperformed him today
2 very important faults on this champions league level.. Crazy
BT sports bringing highlights out at the speed of light
smh where's the psg barca game that was so fun to watch
Well done Liverpool 🤝🏻 I thought Leipzig would win
Where's the PSG highlights? I'm itching to say Mbappe is underrated so I can gather thousands of likes from absolute clueless goons 😂
It was not even dayot fault 😂
Did Bayern keep their receipt?
I love this commentator so much he shows so much energy
Patiently waiting for the Barcelona highlights. Can't wait for those salty Barca fanboys in the comment section.
Well this took the piss to upload didnt it
Fantastic performance. Best we’ve played in a long time. Quick, decisive, clinical and most importantly the clean sheet! 🔴👊
man u lost 3-2 to them with a penalty and liverpool beat them ez, man u are trash
Glad CJ was kept on when OX & Shaq came on. He does great defensive work alongside Gini unlike the aforementioned.
Well done boys
That was Mukiele mistake not upamacano for the second
Very intense game
3:26 most overrated defender!!
And Wang couldn’t hit the target 😂
Wish they wouldn’t have Mcmanaman on commentary. Awful commentator and biased when Liverpool are playing. Same as Sky putting Neville on United games and Carragher for Liverpool’s league games.
Curtis jones is such a silky, skillful footballer
2 mistakes 2 goals. Where we heard that before for Liverpool, this time they are on the winning side
Where’s all the rival fans flooding in to talk about the game? 🤣
For once, a team defended badly against Liverpool
Decent defender there for RB Leipzig
Bayern signed this Upamecano 😂
BT sport know what they are doing by not showing the PSG game first...
Man, Leipzig should’ve won
We are waiting for Mbappe's hat trick!
Lucky win once again
Refresh guys I want to see how mbappe destroyed  barca👀
126th  comment
Errrrr that didn't look like upamecano making the mistake for manes goal hahahah
Lucky goals but deserved them after that first jalf
Not everyone can beat Leipzig
RB were so bad.
RB Leipzing have a chance to make a comeback
Kabak was quality tonight
Early comment
Yup we’re all waiting on the PSG Barca match
EUROPEAN 'ERITAGE
This isn’t Leipzig vs Liverpool   This is red bull vs ribena
YNWA
Liverpool might not be doing as well in the PL as they wanted but i still think they can win the Champions league.
No one cares. Upload PSG vs BARCELONA
God I hate Steve mcmanaman commentating
Get this rubbish off. Where is the barca game!?
It was mukiele not upamecano...
Waiting for the barca psg highlights
Waiting for PSG vs Barcelona
The ball didn’t go out
Leipzig better turn up in the 2nd leg like they did when they faced us the 2nd time...
watched the full game, watch the highlights too because i’m that type of person :)
What a game. Jones was solid so was Kabak, as beautiful defending from him. The whole team were on fire especially Mane and Salah, and a great bounce back from the Leicester game
Best Man Utd team in few years Leipzig 3-2 Man Utd   Worse Liverpool team in few years  Leipzig 0-2 Liverpool   Different levels.
Here before 1000 views
Salah the overrated four season wonder
Lets be real, Leipzig were awful tonight.
This game was good but we are too inconsistent. We could have been punished easily. Have to up our game
Allison with his confidence back
Took their chances well, but looked like they got fairly lucky from the highlights! Europe might be their best chance to salvage this season
Rb leipzig are the champions league version of leeds united
I thought it was Liverpool who had defensive mistakes costing them the game
Mane was playing selfish today
PSG highlights please...
mane is a g i have rated him in his southampton days as well
Normal service resumed? Lets hope so reds!!!
when they are on their day Liverpool’s front 3 is unstoppable
Mukiele made the mistake for mane goal not upamecano 🤦🏽‍♂️3:08
Wow hopefully Liverpool will get better in the prem now.
Liverpool finally wins a game in ages
Very professional performance by Liverpool tonight
Really dont get why Leipzig didnt start a striker when liverpool had none of their best centre backs.
United lost to this leiqzig team ??
Give us Barca getting clarted highlights
never disrespect Mo Salah.

Upamecano is overrated, he’s good but he still has a lot to learn
Beating Leipzig is not for everyone👀
Follow __ceev__ on Instagram and I promise u £1000 in 2022
Salah has been incredible for Liverpool this season Absolutely unreal
Hi
Never write off Liverpool, particularly in CL especially against any German opposition !!!
Top class performance from Curtis Jones
WE WANT PAG GAMEEE
Goodnight to everyone that didn't say first
Still bin dippers
3:08 Wasn’t Upamecano BT
Me only caring about this result klostermann don’t get upgraded
Great to see Liverpool get the win they deserve 👊🏼
Mbappe on fire
After long time back to win
Kabak was amazing
And people say Mo Salah is a one season wonder 🤔
Back in form baby
Early boizzzz
Liverpool’s league form might have dropped off but they could do some serious damage in the champions league!! 😅
Atletico Madrid fans are confused right now
Champions league merchants
Waiting for the barca psg highlights. Keep refreshing lads
Go on the reds

Amazing win.
Gulacsi bruh
