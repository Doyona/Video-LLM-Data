Had to come look what he was saying in the beginning
A year later you want him out 😂😂😂😂😂😂

I think Spurs might’ve just got the right guy for the job this time
The man’s seen more cups then ufna is man mad😂😂😂😂
Dead food
Despite I’m a Chelsea fan, you always crack me up Ex! You’re so entertaining and hilarious! Total respect! 👊 Keep it up! #Justknow!

I agree Romero to stay he makes me coin on yellow cards ex🤣🤣
Dude your so funny seen cups then heffner bro I like listening to you but I aint no spurs fan
I'm excited too Ex, we need to give this guy a big chance, and hope Levy doesn't screw him over like he's done with every manager we've had. Please...Coys
Ange Postecoglou, Welcome to Spurs; The Graveyard of Football Managers😂
You are spot on,and I have a good premonition for this season,it could be fantastic!
😂😅
Best of luck to ange on managing spurs many men tried it before but all of them failed, I hope range finds what he is looking for.
Can’t wait for the next few months
You’ve got a real special manager. We miss him already 🍀
As a gooner this is a good appointment, he will sort Spurs out and get them playing good football again, you have to keep Kane though.
Really happy with Ang coming. 70-80/% clear out of players and in two years.....something magical could happen? Let's get behind Ang 100% COYS!
The stone old football you were having high hopes for 1 year ago 😂 https://youtu.be/Vbit2rlrxBk
Ex is a global treasure and must be protected by all means.  This is coming from an Arsenal fan.
This is going to be funny in 6 months
*Postegoclouuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuooooozzingsauce.☠️*
Ange is a gaffer mate. Big old ange is a type of bloke that stops over while walking his bulldog to have a friendly chat with ya on ya front porch on an overcast morning. All the old geezers know him on his street and shout "UUHHNNJJ!" when they see him. "Come over for yer cup of tea UHNJ"
Hope he brings that Japanese dude from Celtic with him too
They had Conte and Mourinho managing them only for them to leave this joke club like they never did in their career😂…he thinks crocodile dandee gonna with them the PL😂😂😂
Spursy will finish mid table next season😂
I'm only here to hear blud
I could win the fucking title in two club Scotland let’s see how he does in a proper league..shit i hope. i f@#%ing hate the spuds 🇬🇧⚒⚒COYI
"How do you concede that many goals when you're sitting back and playing defensive football? How??" This guy cracks me up. 😂
He was coaching a Scottish League. This is English fucking baddest league on the mother fucking planet blood
Maguire x Eric Dier=Double Fridge Freezer 🙏🥶🤣. Tottenham Hotspur
A club that made Mourinho look like Tim Sherwood.. Y'all have a history of ruining managerial careers fam
Big ange doesnt do things by halfs.what a job he has on here,spurs are lost.if he makes it padt the first season i will be surprised
Oga shutup
The guy want everyone gonne😅😅😅😅
Bai yuh to funny to not like you I'm a arsenal fan ND I'm following you since you was now getting started showed my brother who is city fan ND u been nothing short of fantastic 😅😂❤😮😅
No one cares about Tottenham 😂  We are here because Ex is Ooozing
It’s going to be a master stroke or a fecking disaster 🇾🇪✌️🔰
He’ll quit within 2 years working at Tottenham and will totally regret leaving Celtic for the Spuds lmao 🤣.
As Non-Spurs Fan... all I'm sayin' is... SELL EVERYONE!
Cant wait to see postecoglou take your banter club to a 11th place finish in 2024 😂
Hahaha he's done well in that mecca of Football.... Australia & Glasgow!!!!
Who?
Great respect for Big Ange!
Harry Maguire will be his first signing
Love the passion . Great to see a Spurs fan who believes in Ange. I hope its not true but Kyogo might be going to Tottenham.  Best of luck to Spurs  next season.
Hahaha!! You man Are a Joke club! You have tried everything 🤷‍♂️ more a stepp down the table
New defender Harry Maguire 😂
It's a good appointment not gonna lie but its still Spurs😂😂😂😂😂
Postecoglou will  shift all the deadwood out, and install a solid intelligent back line,  seriously the guy knows how to build a squad very quickly , and he got a eye for players , and will identify them very quickly to fit into his system, this guy doesn’t mess about , he carries a presence with him  and the media will find that out, !!!
De Man got more cup than Spurs......soooo......
Excellent channel my man 👍
Yeah he’s top manager , there’s no doubt about that, fasten your seats belts , cause he plays a system that’s high octane moving the ball with speed and purpose, with precision interchanging the passing, & movement through the midfield using the wingbacks that deliver the cross for clinical finishing, and the do this for 90 minutes, it’s attack after attack with Postecoglous system!!!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 jeezus I’ve had to subscribe , never laughed so much , you should be on stand up comedy 😂, am a Celtic fan 🍀
I just hope you will not say "we tried Ange" one day.
Just by the fact that ange survived living in Australia he can probably make it a good couple months with this club 😂
Tottenham please give this guy more than one season !
Tone it down loudmouth moolie
Postecoglou?. Aldi frozen fish fingers £2
What a guy Ange Postecogolou is, top class man and manager, hope tae see him do well it spurs keemon👍🍀
Dont get too excited hes a japanese A League Manager.  Youz sacked all these euro trophy winners to appoint a manager from the Japanese League fam.  Give ova fam! He'll be gone within 10 games
I'm a Rangers fan but fair play, this vid was fucking hilarious. Ange is actually a great manager, you guys got a good man on your hands, as much as it hurts me to say that.  Incase Spurs fans doubt him, reminder that not only did he win the treble this season in Scotland but he has also won the title in every league he has went to while playing really exciting attacking football.  I'm so happy he is away from Celtic 😂
This fool is gonna be crying in the watch alongs again next season. Sacked by Christmas
Let’s go Spurs!!!! Top of the mid table     😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Thanks so much for your entertaining podcasts
Love how he comes out with lines like “stiff like mega sword out of power rangers,” takes me way back fam 😂
For a Pigeon on a Stick club, this is hilarious! Soon they'll appoint a Chinese noodle maker to take charge of this clown club, Inc,
We need a manager like this and levy been spending millions on so called win now managers when he could of been putting the money into the squad. Just because we have one of the best stadium and training ground around it dont mean we are an elite club. A lot of our fans need a reality check and need to put their feet back on the ground
If only Tottenham fc are as passionate as this man they could’ve won some kind of trophy by now
As an Aussie who's been enjoying Expressions carrying on about Arsenal this season but is now backing Aussie Ange to do his ting at Tottenham, its extremely heart warming 😊.
Tottenham *M.ANAGERS*........*HISTORY*........They always *E.ND in F.   A.    I.    L.   U.  R.  E *......✍🏿
Another Gerrard
🤣🤣🤣
U can be getting the best manager you ever had he takes no prisoners big any his brand of football is really really is pure offence the only word of caution is Scottish football is the worse state its ever been we are still producing some top class players as in andy Robertson john Mginn kirean Tierney theres a couple  of players comein through the system who are going to be top notch you just have to look the players celtics sold in last few few years Virgil van dyke Victor winyama Kieran tiernay stuart Armstrong Fraser foster young Dutch guy they sold to Bayarn lab 19million sold players for over 100million its a well run club but the Scottish league is poorest its ever been uv got hearts and hubs and Aberdeen Celtic rangers and the rest are rank rotten ange teams got a habit of losing goals playing great then knackered after 60mins plus a stubborn habit of picking  joe Hart the worst keeper av ever seen but the positive side when we played real Madrid Celtic missed about 8or9 really easy chances should have been 4nil up first 20mins but ended up lousein 3,0 because of anges naive set up at the back with butter slippery fingers heart we have had some of best mangers at celtic Martin onell Brendan Rodgers Billy McNeill
Treble winning manager coming into Spurs. If he leaves Spurs with zero trophy, it will be poetic.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Of Mice and Men!  You are the people's poet!
I hope Tottenham Hotspurs does not make this guy career wack as well  And they shouldn't spoil his record as he has won in every league he has been in
Hope  jed gets  a new  chance
Don’t do this to yourself,  man…
Iam  so happy  you  are  smiling  again i am  so excited
Almost let an F bomb loose there Ex! XD
Will get to see Spurs  n West Ham in Perth  Australia  in a exhibition  match this year i believe  should be fun cheers from Aus😅
Can't help but feel this signing is a touch! Let's go!!
As an Australian and a lifelong Spurs fan this is like a dream. He’s been my favourite Coach since his South Melbourne days. He was coached by Ferenc Puskas and that is who he is inspired by. The man plays the football you want to watch, it’s not just a job for him it’s his life. I just hope we give him time, there was a point at Celtic when results weren’t going their way. But he pushed through and won a treble playing some of the best football I have seen. Even in the champions league they gave teams a serious scare. I am behind him 100% there’s a saying in Australia “if anyone can do it Ange can” TTID COYS🔥🔥
I think he is a complete nutter...go join chelsea...
As an Aussie, I would nothing more than for this to succeed. But every time I build a little enthusiasm, a little excitement, something in the back  of my head pops up and tells me to put the excitement on the back burner until after atleast the first hurdle. Give it say 6 moths or so. If he is still there, and we are playing decent football, OK, im going to get a bit more up tempo about it. Unfortunately at every corner, every time i feel a bit of excitement, It pops into my instincts that this could be Nuno mach ii. Having knowledge of all people involved, and the full situation, its hard to just sit back and enjoy the ride. This team has been poorly thrown together hodge podge, by a string of defensive managers. The way Ange plays, this squad just does not at all fit. Not one of the defenders knows how to pass the ball, so forget about possession from the back, we have zero ball playing mids, we have about 2 million of the same defensive "get a foot in" cms, zero creativity, nobody who can string passes together and tie the back to the front. Our best players, lets just say for this sake that Kane does stay, none of them are the sort of attackers that are going to be chasing their players around and pressuring from the top. For Ange to play in his system, there is no real way of getting around it, he needs almost a full new team. If Levy isnt going to give Jose or Conte the keys to the house to get what they need, I dont understand why he will all of a sudden give a guy who has never been at the top level the keys. I do have other worries, but that is one of the biggest ones.
Big mam ting ex   this new guy will sort spurs out an make us in to a   mega plan football  team nice hype 🇲🇸
Arteta’s living rent free in don’s brain he’s got him speaking Spanish 😅
This guys is entertaining af! Not a Tottenham fan, but here I am.
Ex it’s not the managers fault it’s spurs all your managers won  things with every other club they managed.
yo i mistakenly listened to the inro on 2x, and i swear its the best thing I've watched this year🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
😂
I don’t wanna listen to this guy any more. This is the same guy who kept  on saying “conte Out”. Remember we would be playing champions league football next season if Conte stayed until the end of the season
I’m coining Postman Pat before Ex does. The man will either deliver a trophy or more misery on Spurs 😂
Celtic fan here. Ange is a brilliant manager, a fantastic man manager, who will bring unbelievable attacking football. Im gutted to see him go, but he goes with my best wishes, and i hope he takes Spurs back to the CL at least.
Bruh see how Chelsea was this season if I’m harry I go beasuse that’s were this team going next season watch I tell u 🤣😂🤣🤣😂😂 remember my comment 🤣😂😂😭😭
You won’t be exited about big Ange come October when he has you lot in the bottom half of the table 😂
SPURSY PURE BANTER CLUB 😂😂😂😂
Enjoy, you’s are in for a fun ride. Mon the Celts, mon the spurs 🍀
He will be sacked by Christmas 😂😂😂😂
Spurs Went For The Cheap Opinion. Spurs are mid table at best.
youll be in for a treat ange plays good football and brings passion and energy to his squad. Football is about the right environment and good football nurturing talent and sticking to your principles.
His European record is awful....against teams slighter better than scortish ones😂
Im an Arsenal fan and I love watching this dude haha. Im also an Aussie and im more pissed off our legendary coach is now with our biggest rivals 😂 that for me is harder to take then the hatred between Arsenal and Tottenham. I want him to succeed so much but not too much haha 😅
West Ham are the 2nd best team in London and are capable of winning trophies unlike Spurs
Ex never learns can’t wait for the season and he’s ranting on every stream 😂
Nah this nigga sum else 😂😂😂
My hopes are not high
The Of Mice and Men references crack me up every time.  GCSE English nostalgia.
Brooo! The name voice!?!? I'm finished!!! This guy is the goat. I love this guy!
Ange is no nonense he will get spurs to top 4
imposticoglou
You're too loud bruv
how does this guy breathe 🤣🤣🤣
As long as Daniel levy does not back him up in the transfer window the lad will not wave a magical wonder and make Eric Dier Richalison world class players
I'm not happy about having a Scottish Aussie But now this guy says this. I'm ready to believe Haha. Get him on the main stream
Celtic fan here gutted the big man has left  to join spurs ,i wish him all the best and success in E P L  "spurs fans ange is your diamond in the mud .im looking forward to next season to see how he does down south of the border "😊HAIL HAIL
impostercoglu ahaha
Bruv, blud, bro.
With this manager tottenham will win World cup😁😁😁😁😁
I'm a disappointed celtic fan but you made me laugh enjoy big Ange he will have Tottenham flying I'm positive about this God bless
As an Australian and Spurs fan, can’t wait for pre season and Ange’s time in Perth.
The fans love everywhere he goes due to his football style , it will be no different at spurs .
Harry Maguire to the rescue 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 #chelseafan🤘🏾💙
The annual Spurs summer optimism in effect
He is not even better than Nuno Gomez.
Clown club.
I’m on the fence to be honest expressions, but I will back any manager who comes in, we do need to try something different and reading up about this guy it gives me some hope.
Stavros lost a dog poo?? Never heard of him mate
LOL what a joker. He better be prepared to get bottled with that kind of manager LOL. YOU ARE GONNA LOST HARRY KANE! FACE REALITY.
And he was will buy carter viikers back
This guy gets goal that u need good singing
I'm a Rangers fan, and it hurts me to say this but Tottenham are getting a great manager.  I'm glad to see him leave Celtic.
Only thing I like about Tottenham is expressions.  Punch lines king, him and Jadakiss are on punchline levels
I’ll give him a season before they “Spurs” him as mess up his CV 🤣
I’m Not into soccer ,I’m a  Postecoglou fan simply because he barracks for the same Aussie rules football team I Barack for I know it’s a pointless comment , but there you have it anyway 😂
I cannot wait for the 0-3-3 start to the season. The only Ange Expressions will be screaming about then is Angina.
ANGE HAS HIS DEPARTURE  RANT ALL WORKED OUT ALREADY  😂😂😂😂😅😅
Ange is good manager. He likes to play ball. But... He's got a better chance of winning a World Cup with Greece than winning with the Spuds.
Living in the shadows of the gunners 😅😅😅😅
It didn’t matter who u got your club is dead 😂
Rants only ,just spursy stuff 😂😂😂😂
Rants only ,just spursy stuff 😂😂😂😂
Celtic fan here, you have no idea how good this man is! All of you doubting him with love him to bits am very disappointed he’s left Celtic
That Batman line took me out damn 😂😂😂
The Lenny impression of mice and men killed me 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hes a world class manager, and i wish him nothing but success. He was loved here, and ill be watching his progress. Give him the time and money he needs youll be competing. HEs more than capable. Look after him.
Can't wait to see Postecoglou's Spurs to challenge Brentford for the UECL 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Arteta as no CV but still won trophy since joining Arsenal and Spurs won FUCK ALL SINCEC😂😂  jokes on you B-Tech Chris Tucker
All I'll say is that when Wenger originally joined arsenal, everyone said "Arsene who?"...he also managed in Japan coincidentally... why don't you try being a real fan and support your team instead of spewing a cringe trashing diatribe for views...
Embarrassing fake attitude man, it’s starting to get cringe knowing you’re literally acting these days for views. Whatever about exaggerating things but stop being fake as fuck man. The Aussie Steven Gerrard 😂😂😂
I’ll have whatever he’s having
Dead food Spurs are hilarious 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
i don't think it was the managers - mostly the team was shit. look at the players you have.Clear out is overdue at your club. Only issue is teams around you lot are stronger
🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺
Musaka Allardyce
#COYS ❤
Here he goes again is this another recoding of the last 3/4 managers
He will improve your boring shit playing style that's for sure. If he has 100% control then there will be only one way for Spurs UP. But not enough to challenge for a champions league spot.
Didn't expressions get this hyped over Mourinho, Conte and Nuno look how they all turned out... I look forward to Kane Joining Madrid soon.
1:10 very stupid for Tottenham 😁🤣
Ex u cant go one vid without talking about arsenal lol we live rent free in yo head 😂😂
Angies Post. Will she deliver 🤣🤣
The Solomon of the South Stand speaking wisdom.
Tottenham interested to bring Maguire
This video was hilarious 😂😂. Alot of truth spoken in amongst the hilarity. Thank you for showing respect to Ange. Give him time Spurs and he will improve and more likely bring success. I'm a Celtic fan but I think I have a new English team. COYBIG COYS
As a Celtic fan I’m now a temporary Spurs fan 😅🍀
Your energy is exactly what Ange brings to your club!! You all underestimate the man, and that's totally understandable. And after following him for 25 years,I can tell you a couple of things, He's budget to performance ratio would be off this planet!! I've seen comments elsewhere questioning his ability in european football in the CL, and in the same breath bag Scottish football. So if these people think scottish premier league is no good? Couldn't they concede that where the footballs coming from and the price tag attached to it, that performance's against Real Madrid, and praise from Pepe for he's yokahama's team performance pre Celtic, that maybe this guy knows something about the game ? regardless of where he comes from? Ange builds the best teams from the players he has access to. Lookout!!! PL because he now has the access he's always wanted!! Enjoy the ride Spurs👍
Postecoglou is good manager but Spurs fans need to give him time. Don't expect top 4 in the first season. He will bring in couple of Japanese players from Celtic, they are ballers.
Good riddance greedy man always want more money get lost
Ur defence next season is HARRY MAGUIRE 😂😂😂
You need a reface like Katie price.
Love the Aussie Open reference. You going AEW at Wembley?
cant wait for the mid season "get this manager out" meltdowns, Ex its not the manager its spurs players that are shit, shitarlison, chicken royale etc
COYS!!!!!
Hopefully Dier,Sanchez, Emerson, and Maguire joining you guy's this season 😅😅😂
You should not be talking about Arteta 😂😂 You have seen almost all the best  manager at Spurs, no trophies 😅😅😅.  Leavy is about to sign Maguire to parner Sanchez, and Dier at the back 😂😂
Bro if Harry maguire goes to Tottenham and Harry kane leaves I predict relegation 😂
Netflix and chill stadium 🤣🤣🤣🤣
😂😂😂 Postecogloooooooooooooooozing sauce
When we appointed Mourinho, I said it would end in tears and it did. When we appointed Conte, I said it would end in tears and it did. I have a good feeling about Ange. COYS!
I hate Tottenham. Just saying. Ange is mustard. Everywhere he goes, he wins. He has massive autism. Obviously. Serial winner. Serial introvert. Listen to him and you might find a trophy.
Ps big ange will absolutely transform spurs given the time and the backing he deserves , hes a no nonsense c unt that plays unreal football n here leave kyogo be
Gutted big ange has left     ,, hope u well and the best for the futre coybig
Idk what needs more work mid or defense.
I love watching expressions from my Villa in Aston ❤
Impostecoglou haha can’t wait for the slander
Bro I think it’s a top appointment for Tottenham, as a United fan I understand how good a no nonsense manager is for a club and spurs need this. Fair play
Smash a like. Smash ya gyal lol. After Spurs finish like Rock Bottom. Pinned 123.
First signing Harry Maguire 😂😂😂😂
Harry Maguire to spurs here we go 😂
You had Jose and Conte and still went all football seasons trophieless blud😂😂😂😂
👉🏾😔🍺😁
Yeah another winning manager going to spurs to win f all 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love Ange! I hope he does a great job!
Ange Postecoglu will play good football, better than Conte or Ryan Mason for sure! And he will also bring in some techy Japanese ballers, maybe even take his Greek compatriot Tsimikas to Spurs, lets hope so anyway.  Souvlaki and Sushi settings!
Gassed about a man because he won a treble in Scotland 😂🤦‍♂️ that’s there 8th treble anyone can win at Celtic!!
Stevie G did well in Scotland, but smashing Kilmarnock and Aberdeen is different levels compared to getting beat everywhere you go in the prem... He'll either fade like a fart in the wind, like Stevie, or will be an overweight Brenda's Rodgers
Lucky to get top 10 under him. Scottish League is a bit of piss. 😅😅😅 Even more in the shade of the Gunners. Your one team we won't have to worry about next season. Tottenham held a lucky dip for a manager 😅😅😅
No need to shout.
One of the dumbest spurs fans out there
Should've been a Chelsea fan blud would've killed me more😂😂😂😂
Wenger who? Came from Japan with no European football experience
i can honestly see us being in a relegation fight next season.
To Dare is to Didgeridoo 🦘 🇦🇺
We are about to have a new love affair COYS
Harry in Da Back 😂and not Kane 😂
Don't expect too much to quick, unless he replaces Eric Dier, Sanchez and Davies in that defence not much will change at all
Whatever makes you happy ex
Djed Spence and Joe Rodon should get a run out. Rodon kept a clean sheet against PSG this season even.
Nobody is laughing at Ange being appointed
Maguire + DIER LETS GO!
The only Spurs fan I watch. Love Ex to bits❤
So that’s how you say that.
Blud Steven Gerrard went from unbeatable with Rangers 20/21 to a horrible spell at Villa.
I don’t get what your excited about  Celtic manager signs Lloris announced he’s leaving Kane will probably leave and you’ll have a rebuild with a manager that has no pull and will probably end up signing Scottish league players or Scottish players and a few unknown guys 🤣 I don’t see this going well regardless of what football he plays who is replacing Kane and hitting it running because mr Levi don’t know how to spend money you guys have missed on every signing you have acquired everyone just looks like they downgrade 😂
Australian big sam
Free flowing football? Against Aberdeen and Dundee?! 👏 👏 👏
Whatever happens I don't know how you can still imagine beating Man City, Liverpool, United, Arsenal and Newcastle to Top 5. Not even considering a push from Chelsea.  You're stuck at 6th or 7th at best
Postecoglu has had to deal with inferiority complexes and losing mentalities before. In Australia, Football is well behind the popularity of other codes like AFL, Cricket and Rugby League. The Australian media doesn’t give a shit about football and is always asking why the nation team is so shit. Ange turned this around completely and won trophies with the team. He is a demanding, inspiring and dedicated man manager as well as a tactician.
How good! A fellow Aussie at my team. Finally something to cheer about at Spurs.
Remember Steven Gerrad won the Scotish League with record breaking points
Glad you are not slating the appointment. Ange is gonna bring us some beautiful football and if given the time, maybe a trophy
Remeber when spurs fans were excited about bringing in winning coaches like Mourinho & Conte 🤣🤣.
You guys signed a proven league winner in competitive countries and premier League winner. Mourinho. Hype up and failed.   You guys signed a proven league winner in competitive countries and premier League winner. Conte. Hype up and failed.   Now you guys are hyped getting a guy with a CV no where near as good as those too. Banter.
He a Btec Brendan Rodgers he won the treble and has premier league experience but u go for the fake Brendan ange
Harry Maguire INCOMING!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Seems like I’ve heard this from you BEEEEEEEEFFFFFOOORRRRREEEEE.
He will win them a trophy trust me on that
Soooooo, what’s stopping this from being a Graham Potter to Chelsea kind of move?
I am very doubtful about this appointment. A few games in the new season and we may rue the ones we missed like Nagelsman.
Those managers expressions 😂😂
😅😂 Legend!
Brenda yah tuff nuh bumbocloth
‘Arteta was handing out more cones than corneto’😂😂😂
This is what ganja does to people blood...ya mon rastafari..Mon the hoops
Who?
Hendrick Larsson🤣🍀
You are in for a treat bro🍀
With Ange the manager , it gives me an excuse to watch his videos!👍🤣🤣🤣
This will age well 😂😂
This is going to age horribly 😂😂😂😂
I think Spurs will be a much more attacking side under Ange. He also works well with Asian players, Son will thrive under him.
This bloke is the best thing to ever happen to Tottenham 😭😭😭
another disaster in the makin' ... lots of funny videos for 2023/2024 , ex = the gift that keeps on givin' ... just don't give up and keep entertainin' us.
Impostercoglou looks like my local kebab shop owner
Gotta say worst decision that Daniel Levi has made I’ve give him till Xmas spurs are in the mess don’t get to hype up you all know it always end up in disappointment as usual
I can’t wait for the season to start and see your tears here
I remember the Conte hype last year…. Here we go again 😂😂😂 Dude talked about Arteta who brought the team to second place, it’s hilarious coming from a spurs fan who celebrate finishing above arsenal 😂. Can’t wait for the mid season meltdowns.
Love your commentary and enjoy the ride with Ange from a die hard celtic fan living in ozz. I will be watching for the Spurs transformation next season. 😅
End of the 23/24 season... JEEZ expressions back with another video and I am seething FAM! this Greek humus ham roll needs to leave Tottenham Hotspur NOW.
doesnt matter who the manager is ENICOUT
I am Liverporian Down under - Great Manager no dought -you have enough arterial players to be very competitive - Ange will no dought transfer the Team by finding Gems out there for a fraction of the cost!
As an Arsenal fan the spuds can do  what they want , but as an Aussie I'm happy for Ange , best of luck to him ,
1:22-1:28 is eaassily the most comical moments of my entire year thus far🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I like the rabbits George 😂😂😂
The manager does not matter for Tottenham, Levy is ruining the club
Can't say the name 😊😊
Welcome Aussies. COYS
treble winner ? booker need open this odd bet
"Mikel Artapas" lmfao
Quality craic
Bro let’s be honest…he will be gone by January lol
25 seconds in and this brudda already talking about arsenal bro its a spurs vid
can’t wait to see expressions crying next season 😂😂😂
When catch you in traffick its static nigga
Ange has won trophies everywhere he’s managed and for the national team.
The best thing about Tottenham is definitely this guy 😂
He is 67 same age as Martin Jol
Lets hope this new manager can bring us a trophy. COYS 💙
lmfaoooo uno! dos! tres!!!
Steve G slippery won it Scottish league rest is history lol😂
As an Aussie he's actually great. Been doing it for years ❤
anyone can win the league in scotland if you manage celtic
you are a clown....scraping the barrel
U got it all on point about Ange there bro and u are about to see some Angeball in England …  the EPL opps are Fahked mate
Ange will have that defence fixed in no time. Eric Dier won’t get a game.
Spurs celebrating they finally got a manager 🤣 anyone can win with celtic In that b-tec league
To dare is to Didgeridoo 😊
Harry McGuire 😂😂😂
yea you have a new manager and yes you will still win sweet f.a next season and your manager will be sacked after 10 games facts 😂
More rebuilds than Ukraine
WELL AT LEAST HES A WINNER IN A ONE HORSE 🐴  RACE
That intro🤣🤣🤣🤣
When I see aggressivity, I act aggressivity 😂😂😂
Another manager coming to the elephants graveyard of-football😂😂😂
The problem will always be Daniel Levy.  No manager can save a team when the owner has no interest in investing.  Is going to be another tough season for Spurs especially if Harry Kane is gone.  End the stream Dave is going to be a common occurrence.
Celtic supporter here.  Ange will save Spurs.   He's better than anybody Spurs have had since Poch.  Of course, Levy will stay so that's not going to help.  But two things:  1)  Levy doesn't like spending money and doesn't know how to run a team, but 2) Ange has the pulse of up and coming talent in Asia, Middle East, and South America where the prices are cheap and the talent is overlooked.
its HENRICK larson not hendrik
Ange is a Winner! Put him in league where a team cost 5 mill/20 mill/100 mill/ 500 mill, he wins. Yes EPL is a upgrade, so will the players be playing his system. Strap in and enjoy the ride 👍🏆🇦🇺
Postecoglou transformed Celtic. Celtic never had a team n he had to sign 12+ players in the first window😅
Best times have come from new manger tactics fact he plays attacking football lets go
He is a yes man bruv just like poch was for u lot
Ange posta no clue ..
We need a new team 😂
Spot on ....stiff like a megazord😂😂😂
“Turn this club to where it was” and where is that 😂😂😂😂
There's a reason why this guy is at Celtic at 57. I'm sorry but this is a brutal appointment. There's a new breed of manager now, Pep, Arteta, Howe, Ten Hag etc. Even Klopp has failed to keep up. Postecoglou will get Totenham back into Europa at best.
I’m withholding judgement right now. See what happens.
I like the rabbit George
Your delusional  has always,  love form jamaica
Be careful what you Spurs fans hope for as a Celtic fan , just to warn you he may sneakily organise a contract without you knowing for at least 2 weeks with a club who are bigger but a don’t see Brentford going for him anytime soon 😜
😂😂😂😂😅😅😅😅 I can't wait for when Expressions starts hammering on this guy soon...we are waiting 😅
Ange POTS-OF-DOG-POO 💩💩💩😂😂😂😂😂
Underwhelming FC 💯🤣
We’ve all seen this before haven’t we?
Expression will said with good vibes at every manager hired before this. But we know what the last result will be... Sack in the morning 😁😁
Australian United fan here, let me just say.. I'm worried.  I know how good this guy is if he's backed, he will get Spurs somewhere in the top 4 in the next 2 years.
Don’t matter what manager you get look at the players you got dead team 😂😂😂
Neil Lennon and Brendan Rogers were scrubs... this guy could be too. Seems liek Levy's type of guy- some Greek fraudster haha
Waite for it i give spurs 7 months to  be back in crisis again
Please release Son Heung-min from this club  Kane will leave this team soon.
Do they have fossils down under? Just asking…
Bein disgraceful and a complete shambles of shit for to long so I'm gunna give this man a chance,looking 4ward to try and play the right way surly it can't be as bad as it's bein ffs..joke club 😢  Coys!
Ex will praise and welcome anything so long as it's NEW.
😂😂😂this guy
bro said champagne football??? Bro said the same thing when mourinho came in, when conte came in, when Pochettino came in( came close but lost) i bet expressions is gonna be calling for this guy's head at the end of the season
That’s your money 😂😂😂😂 he’s not putting a penny into that club, WAKE UP
Was Ange who I wanted, no, was he on my shortlist, no... but if we're gonna lose 6-1 in Newcastle I'd rather we tried attacking them
The only time Tottenham was really good was when Harry Redknapp was the manager
All I see is a dead club 🤷🏽‍♂️ who you trying to kid
‘We’re state property like beanie sigel’  Wow. You actually went there!
Good point. But when last did Tottenham win a cup competition?
haha postecoglooozing suce. Great appointment by Spurs, proper football manager
A cocker spaniel could manage Celtic let’s be honest, two teams in Scotland! Not convinced this guy will succeed in the premiership especially with ‘that’ chairman! Time will tell😂
thing is you get good managers but you have useless players apart from kane and son
Tottenham is and allwqys will just a banter club cant wait for them to finish were chelsea did next season😂😂
Already! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bro you can have Harry 'the planet' maguire for your new defense 😂
Who's "hendrick larson"
New Spurs coach- Paste & Glue 😂
Expression u need KG's Soundboard ur " Dead " was not hitting 😂😂😂 Deeaaddddd
Celtic are a massive club with a rich history. Ange is in the top 5 managers celtic have ever had, in their entire history. Thats the level you are getting
Ange is the man , Trust me , I remember when he took over my Australian team , first game we lost 5-0 , after like 10 rounds we were first , let him cook
You have no choice but to accept it, as no one wants to accept Tottenham's job. You better support what you have, lol
YEAH! You fucking mad all right! You need a tight defense? get Harry Maguire. Maguire would tackle everything that is stand his way including his won team mates.
Your defence will be tight as a crabs ars jst give the man time 😂
Ex, you might be ready for a champagne football, but champagne football is not ready for Tottenham 😂😂😂
😂😂de man  say defence is 'lord ,have ,mercy upon my soul' 😂😂 mate A.P. can't produce worse football that we've had for the last 4 yrs !!
Bigger fish fry 😅
Come next season Ex will start crying again.😂
Mikel Ar tapas is just a racist comment. If someone called Son Heu Ming Chow Mein or Saka, Bukayo Jollof Saka it would quite rightly be called out. Your comment is no different. Do better.
Gutted 🍀🍀🍀 If big Ange gets a chance he'll turn Spurs around - Just don't come looking for Kyogo, Hatate, CCV or Jota!! 😝 congrats!!!
Ange lots of dog poo!
They will still get battered everywhere they go.
Underwhelming Hotspurs FC😂
Can’t wait for the inevitable season meltdown 😂
Tottenham to become a mid table team
Bane breaking Batman’s back, nice reference 😂
U hype up every new manager then things go south 😂😂
Why is this fool still talking about arteta he should be sat quietly in the corner 😂
Mans fallen into the trap again within hours of the new manager being announced, cant wait for the meltdown in November 😂
After the shit shows of Mourinho and Conte , AP will be like a breath of crisp alpine air .Lets give him a chance and get behind him .
I give him 6 months!
Dam, this is what I must be like on cocaine.
Tootanham hootspish.
absolutely gutted to lose ange, still love him honestly 😭 give him time and he WILL be a success, guaranteed!! he will also play football to fall in love with, enjoy!
More cones than Cornetto 😂😂😂😂😂😂
It's not the coach it's the players
I cannot wait to see Ange work his stuff. Aussies warned Celtic supporters that their gonna love him and then miss him when he leaves.
You know them way there 😂😂
Name sounds like a Mascot
Bro this manager ain’t done shit that the Celtic u9s manager couldn’t do. Any football coach with half a brain could win the double with Celtic in that shit league
Spurs fans actually had a petition to stop this happening 😂
I’m a grooner and he’s so funny !!! So much better than the divs on AFTV illiterate divs come on AFTV find a guy like Expression’s !!! Proper funny
This man loves pro wrestling lmao
I am an Arsenal fan, but I love this man. More misery to the Spurs needed blud.
Can't wait for the post match clips of him taking an L
Why are so many Spurs fans confused about the way their club spends money? It works like this; owner (Levy) appoints manager, manager CHOOSES players they want, owner simply FUNDS it. So whoever Spurs bring in and choose to BUY, is done so by the MANAGER, not Levy. For some reason at Spurs they think Levy is choosing the players and of course can't back up this daft theory with ANY verification at all.
Ange 😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Good appointment i recon he will do well imagine if he brought carter vickers back to the lane😂. His been like a new player since he left spurs. Ange is a gd manager he will get you man playing attacking football
The Australian big Sam in the house..not by his style of play but the way he looks
Hope angelo schools arteta 😂
Want to see big ange do well in England. Hope he proves everyone wrong
I like the rabbits, George 😂
Can see this going badly wrong... nuno 2.0 in the making
We make  stars ,produce managers ,create the core  from the academy  to 1st tem
Sounds like a spell from Harry Potter
The good thing about him he’s a manager on his way up not on his way out
It took you 10 seconds to mention Arsenal 🤣🤣🤣 Flop Rider…small club mentality just use to mediocrity!
Let’s give it 90days probation 😂 first.
Fellow Celtic fan here. You have got a special manager in your hands. Hopefully, he gets backed
Ask ang about bjk coming from sceptic child abusers 🇬🇧
Love you Expressions
all good till we got FUCKING DIER AND MAGUIRE IN THE BACK
Give AP a chance, cut the snobbery. Club is in shambles sinking with dead weight... dier, sanchez, sarr, perisic, hopefully AP sends them all packing
42 players since 2008 have won trophies after leaving spurs 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Loads of j league players incoming...😂
Jed Spence bro
I think it's a solid appointment for you lot and I think if given time he can get things going in the right direction.  Your fanbase is the problem though. So irrationally impatient. So entitled for the last few seasons. So unaware of where youse came from. Are you lot gonna be willing to sit through a few 8th place finishes while he gets his ideas across? Or do you expect to be getting top four again immediately?   I think selling Kane now and upgrading the defense should be the first order of business. IDK what the Tottenham academy looks like, but there have to be some decent internal options. Should look at how Arsenal did it as kind of a blueprint because we all know Levy isn't spending shit.
For the last few seasons it's been fossil football. You're crying out for free flowing football. Well now you got free flowing fossil football. I can't wait til Luton slap 4 past you and it'll be End The Stream Dave...🤣🤣🤣
Nicki minaj once said "You get what you buy its what you paid for" .....this applies to spurs😂😂
Big Up EX 🍀🍀🍀
Enjoy yer Angeball big man🍀Enjoy his pressers also bro!! DETESTS stereotype stupid football questions
Wonder how far down the wanted list he was ? Be ok when you end upnin the Champioonship😂
I love this man😂 coys💙
Tottenham players are in for a shock their fitness levels will have to be up for the kind of football Ange wants.
See. I’m even looking at the squad ow and thinking . New keeper that can play, cos he’s adopted the de zerbi play with the keeper and that’s guna be important. Lenglet will be good, one of the best ball playing cb around. Reg was never a bad player when fit, Lo celso could surprise. Rodon never got a chance. I’d like to see them given chances as we can’t get back half what we payed.  Even winks and dare I say ndom, now we’re not fossil football. with  3-4 really good buys, no midweek football the squads brimming
That mice and men bit bro 😂😂😂😂
Mate never stop we luv you
As a gooner im getting some serious cristian gross vibes, from the league that made gerrard look good! Brilliant
Tottenham seen more man thru the door than Katie price fam
The best of luck to the ANGE
W Intro!!!!!!!!
Aussie open fam
Man be reaching....😂!!!
The end of Tottenham 🎉🎉🎉
there is a lot difference between SPL and premier league. I don't see this working. Your chairman is the problem at spurs
It was "Arsene Who?" when Wenger got to Arsenal in 1996.. Look how he turned out.
Arsenal 6 points in the basket before we kick the ball...😂
Loool the way expressions is trying to put some positivity on this signing 😂😂😂😂😂
you try everyone
Ex YOU DID SAID THE SAME THING WHEN YOU GOT CONTE IN
Great energy
Speaking fucking English.
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Bro u are classic funny 😆 ANGE IS LEGEND from Oz to the world HE WINS THINGS
"Mikel Ar-tapas"?????? What's the difference between that and associating Son with DVD's?????
Great manager but your team is shite,pity he'll fail at spurs
What about djed spence and udogie dog? We need dem
If all spurs fans spent an entire season at home watching all the games, the way that levy would switch this whole setup would be insane lol
Mate anyone can play free flowing football in the Scottish League especially Celtic!
U know dem way der”
Unfortunately this time Spurs didn't have a manager hire circus last time when they at the end signed Nuno
Bro u talk the truth we need a clean out like Katy price 😂
That Aussie Open mention popped me!
If there is no trophy and no top 4 hes gone 1 season wonder
Harry maguire ,Phil Jones and Baily are available well throw them in £50m for Kane
Oh you getting a new defense... Maguire to partner Dier in CB. Match made in heaven
Tottenham has become the ultimate joke. We're passing the joke line and its getting sad now. I expect major toxicity going forward between their fans and ownership, its unavoidable.
Heard good things about him and in fact that he is perfect for spurs and I’m a city fan. Even tho I hate playing you guys, it’s good but you guys are no longer a top 4 team. Top 7 now
They will never learn
Emerson is fine
Welcome Ange. All the haters are scared. You will rebuild and we will be coming with the thunder from down under Glory coys💪
Fast forward few months ……….   Expression: “ I HAVE HAD ENOUGHHHHHHHHHH “! Lol
How about Harry Slab Head McGuire Linked to Tottenham 😂😂😂😂
Stop spitting shit mate! You will soon curse him too..😂
I'm a Celtic fan, this is hilariously talented
Same old story 😴  he's a proven winner in Scotland so was Gérard look what happened to him so was Rodgers 😂😂😂
Can’t wait to watch you next season now hope this guy stays a long time
Who?😂
Im a Man Utd fan and i think this will be a Good appointment. You've tried the "Big names" and they didn't work, kind of similar to Man United before we got Ten Hag. Give him a chance and see what it looks like after 6 months.
Just shows how much the English actually know about football…
Problem is that Tottenham is dead which coach zero  ? Start crying like a baby !! Position Top 10 only
Arsenal fan from Australia here. Not gonna lie, he's the best Aussie manager in our history. Our Brisbane Roar team in 2010-2012 was the best in history cos of Ange. Here's hoping Tottenham curse continues though.. 😂😂😂
Ok I’m hyped now lmao
Harry Redknapp was 61 when he joined Tottenham…no one talked about his age
Celtic fan here. Ange will take no shit from anyone even Levy..... Just give him time Tottenham fans because he will come good and you will love the football that you are going to see
Mourinho was 56 when he joined Tottenham no one talked about his age
Who???
I want Ex to have his hopes get greater and greater as the offseason progresses.
Mans welcoming Maguire as well as new signing 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  Spurs being Spurs, just allergic to success 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The Crips must be fuming at Expressions.  🩸
his the man great manager with huge football pedigree yokohama fc, brisbane fc, Panachaiki fc .... big boy manager
This manager is on the same level a Neil lennon.  He's won slightly more than Steven Gerrard in Scotland 😂
He’s a winner with a winning mentality
Expressions deluded 😂😂😂😂
Arteta won a trophy in his first season btw
the delusion has begun
I want a defense tighter than OJ Simpson's - brilliant 😂
All them top managers who turned spurs down and they end up with who???..
Ange is a good appointment, been watching since his appointment in Japan with Yokohama F. Marinos, I was wondering when he'll get a chance in the Prem and here it is, I thought it would be Everton, don't worry about the football Ange plays beautiful attacking football. He's won in Greece, Australia national team, Japan, and Scotland.  You guys are in good hands
You're the BEST MATE!!! The Conte and Jose impressions killed me man!  Postecu who!!!!!😂😂😂
When he dropped the “Batman and bane”reference I couldn’t hear what he said for the next ten seconds while I laugh my head off,I had too rewind,lol
#ExForSoccerSaturday 😂😂
Ex As always passionate banter
You better not sack him u have to give him time and back him he plays a 4-3-3 so u have to give him at least summer and the next one before u can win a trophy so be patient ( coming from a Celtic fan 🇨🇮 🍀
I love the Aussie Open reference 🔥😂
Your history is a rebuild 😂
They do not learn
To dare is to didgeridoo*   *stolen from the best tweet I've seen today
Celtic fans always over hype players & managers..celtic done nothing in Europe. Playing rangers was his only competitive team
Another manager that has won cups ,then goes to Spurs funny the jockstrap cleaner has won more cups in the English prem .
You gonna be fuming in a few months fam , this is gonna be peakkkkkkk😂
It’s not a 4 year deal
I actually love this appointment. He honestly can't be worse than stellini and his staff
in October 2023 Ex : I WILL NEVER FORGIVE THIS PERFORMANCE, ABSOLUTE MADNESS PORRO IS AN DISGRACE Luton 5-1 Tottenham EXPRESSIONS
I remember Ex being all excited singing Conte's name at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium as he got us CL football, only for Ex to demand for his sacking when we were in 4th spot this season. Give it nine months and Ex will demanding for the Aussie/Greeks sacking when we're in mid-table or lower. Loser Levy gets you sucked in every time Ex, but deep down, you know Levy/Lewis/ENIC are toxic poison, and until they are gone, this ENIC comedy shit show continues indefinitely...
Good to hear someone have faith in the new manager.  He can do what Howe does for us and inspire mediocre players into worldies.  I’ve always had a soft spot for Spurs…good luck!
I'm happy Ex is gassed for Celtics tripple winning manager. Hopefully he can win you the League Cup. 😂😂😂
Kane be gone and now a Celtic manager in💀
Mikel Ar-tapas 😆🤣🤣
Gerrard and Rodgers also won plenty in the Scottish league. We’ll see how Postecoglu will pan out
I give him just over a year why was he tapping the celtic badge and betting his chest,knowing he was going out the door, if he was a real man he should have  been telling the supporters on Saturday  instead of walking and waving to the supporters money talks good ridince the highlander
Welcome ange 🇦🇺🦘coys!  To all the fans slating him already cause he isn’t a big name grow a set and get behind the team.  The issue is and will always be Levy & Enic   Let’s get behind big ange Coys!
Arsenal fan here but I love Ex funniest guy, that’s the one guy that I can’t say anything about or to real Gee shit keep going and keep winning big Ex.
Even if it's only for pre-season, I'm happy that Ex finally has a reason to be excited/happy. Love or hate Spurs; Our boy Expressions is a legit, top tier, content machine. 👊❤
Ex you can win the trebel in scotland lol you melt 😂
Give harry winks a go at that 6 in rotation with bentancur, gil will also be a great player for ange
Speaking as a Liverpool fan who moved up to Glasgow, I was struck by how loved Ange is. He’s no nonsense and connects with the fans. A surprising astute appointment by Daniel levy
As a Aussie and first time watching ya mate. Great passion mate. I hope Spurs do well and play good attacking football. :)
@Expressions Oozing - so BIG Ange is your NEW boss on a 4 year deal until summer 2027 COYTH!
Poste who bro?
I'm doing a keep, bench,  sell video, I want everyone gone.... Lol..  I wanna see Expression face when Dier is made captain...
And he's back.................It's been hard watching you suffer like the rest of us Spurs fans with the negative and defensive boring managers we have had to put up with.. I'm buzzing like you Expressions. Postecoglou wants to be at Spurs so here's to the new season. COYS
POSTECOGLOOOOOOOOOSING GAAAAAAAAAMES
“We are underwhelming Fc blud” 😂😂😂
Man’s about to retire soon and a big pay out from Spuds 🥔 😂😂😂
what a intro bruv!
Nuno lucas mouras dad 😂😂😂😂
Ange era is coming 🔥🔥
Spurs fan will turn against him with their unrealistic expectations
Sacked by january 😂
Fast forward 6 months please 😂😂😂😂
Im dead asf the Mikel Arteta / Pep joke has me dead
I am a United fan but watch this guy as he reminds me of some of my mates, just funny shit comes out of his mouth😂😂... What i will say is they all said the same about Ten Hag, from a farmers league, they all had a pop, not saying much now though.. this guy is the same, has his own philosophy, which is defend from the front, press press press..  I think he will be better than Conte and maoning myrtle..
That intro had more lines and was more entertaining than most of youtube
🤣🤣🤣
The first 2 mangers you said never dead you joker 😂😂😂😂. Speak real facts my G as you good at what you do but don't talk BS . JM got you to a final and you sacked him , AC had a dead team to use so don't blame them blame your dead team and players you bring in 😂😂😂😂
Looking forward to watch ex match reaction videos in next season, must be entertaining under this manager loll
SEETHING HOTSPURS
Hey Ex... first signing by Ange is......   Harry "The Human Slab" Maguire 😅
Celtic season ticket holder here, you have a legend , a proper manager who plays exciting beautiful football, he will bring special things to your club hail hail ☘️🇮🇪
to give you reference ex, the guy is a winner! He has been wherever he has gone. He was on the verge of signing mitoma for celtic before Brighton brought him in.  His knowledge of the asian market is unbelievable, he will bring a 5-6 mill play from there and they will come in and be worth 30 plus mill if they decide to leave. This is from an arsenal and celtic fan
I'm a Spurs fan. Forgive me for my negativity but this guy isn't the answer to our problems. Levy and fringe footballers are the demise of our club. Chairman's need to let the managers manage!.
This is going to end in tears 😂
Easily the most entertaining and knowledgeable football fan YouTuber out there.  Rory, Goldbridge, AFTV...SIT DOWN and take notes.
scottish to English?     didnt gerrard do that???
Postecoglu is here to continue the legacy of failure at Spurs😂
On form today... Lool
I like Xpressions optimism. They may lose, but they'll have fun doing it
" END DA STREAM! HOWWWWW! THESE MAN ARE DEAD FOOD! " WHY DID WE SIGN THIS MAN!  ... I cannot wait! 🤣🤣
I,for one welcome our new Ange overlord !  COYS
All the best to ange🍀💚 love the haters BECAUSE he loves to prove them wrong HH
Pub league manager: perfect for Spuds!
We need a manager that is going to build with us. I hate to say it, but similar to what Arsenal did with Arteta.  Postecgulu sets up the right way, and plays modern football
This is the day that tottenhams fortunes change. Hes a leader of men. COYS
Who ?
Ex pretending to be excited about this appointment 😂😂😂
Celtic and arsenal fan here and I’m very conflicted happy for him for getting such a job but also sad he’s joined you lot
Postcode 📨
At this point... don't play the intro 😭😭😂😂😂
He uses inverted wingbacks, and he enjiys using the half spaces. I think he should go for jota he is amazind and could replace son
Joe hart to sign for spurs soon x_x
Lets be honest, Tottenham was too high profile for UCL Winners. Spurs were simply too good for champions. The mindsets of those type of coaches was too focused on irrelevant aspects of the game, (like winning). This club is simply too good for a manager with any level of competence, it takes serious talent to lose like spurs. You people just dint understand football, just like mourinho, conte, etc. They only have trophies, amateurs.
This is gonna end up bad I can already tell when spurs start doing spurs shit he’s gonna blame this manager 😭😭😭
When you realise levy brought in the manager so he can bring all his asian known players and make spurs bigger in asia 😀😃🙂
Compliments from Uganda 🇺🇬
Ange looks like a f7ckin grizzly bear, FEROCIOUS to say the least, I'm all in.
I’m gonna laugh at this delusional Spursy fan when he flops as well. The problem is spurs squad not the managers.
Hello Mr Daniel, how much u pay that new guy?😜
It's no longer "fam/blud/bro" 🤠it's mate now🇦🇺X🐓  You might win the league cup🤷‍♂️
Ginger Beer football you gonna get
Well done expressions get behind your manager.he’s got 20+ years of experience in management.he’ll be good for spurs.
Even if We Get Jesus Christ of Nazareth as Manager Nothing will Change ,Same Ownership,Same Chairman 😅
CHANGE OF TUNE
Ange Postecoglooozing sauuuuce.
As an Arsenal fan and Aussie , I was hoping we would get him. Ange has wone silverwear with every club his been too. His also got the habbit of making shit clubs good, look at his run in Japan  Appreciate the Aussie open spot.
Get behind Ange and give him time and he'll do you proud. He's a great manager and he'll set the team up to score goals
Yes blud this is who we need . Sell lane and let him spend the p’s on who he wants.
The fall from the top for spurs is real 😂😂😂 these man had the likes of  conte and mourinho and now the rocking wid postecoglou 😂😂😂
Another potentially top coach come to bury his career 😂
That guy is going sacked in the few games of the season lol
love your content mate from a chelsea fan downunder!
I expect him to have a tough first year or two, if he’s allowed to rebuild properly they might win something big
This manager will not last the whole season. Problem is the squad as a whole is sub standard and expectations of the board is sky high
A lifelong Celtic fan but instant subscribe 👍
Our defence are like vampires and the ball is made from garlic fam.
Despite Postecoglou is exactly Spurs level of manager deluded muppets will call for his head in 5 months time, I've already heard Spurs clowns saying if he doesn't deliver top 4 he's failed! Top 4?🤣🤣🤣You'll be lucky to finish in the top half of the table! Flip-flop Expressions saw insulting and belittling Scottish PL at any chance he had, now this clown flip-flopped to the opposite side and he brings up Scottish treble, twat!
Hahahaha, love the Of Mice And Men reference... Ange is a legend and we will miss him... He is smart and driven and doesn't suffer fools , he will elevate your team. I wish him all the best 👍👍
Bro you always go to the opposite of sense with your takes
Spurs fans wanted Arne Slot, but we're vexed about Ange. Ask who Slot was 2 months ago and most wouldn't have a clue. "But Postecoglou has only won the SPL". Erm... Did Slot win La Liga, the PL or Bundesliga? No, he won the Dutch League, which ain't exactly more powerful than the SPL!
As an Arsenal fan I rate Ange did not want him to go to Spurs, hopefully levy does him dirty
Dayuuuum Ex knows about Kyle Fletcher and Mark Davis, He is LEGIT wrestling fans not like those E-drone bandwaggon lol AUSSIE AUSSIE AUSSIE, OI! OI! OI!
I ❤ it when expression is  mad
First spurs signing = harry maguire in swap deal for Kane! Here we go!!!
As a Celtic fan I'm absolutely gutted at the loss of Ange. I wish you all the best with Tottenham.🍀🍀🍀
Ange will be a success. I have total faith 🍀💚 still crying rn
Blud took retirement from winning trophies
Celtic had Real on the ropes last season in the champions league before getting beat, he plays his way, he will hold the players accountable. Look at the state Celtic were in before he came in, completely turned them round. He is the Man.
I remember when arsenal appointed arsene wenger..... I was like arsene who 🤔...... So you gooners can't laugh 🤫 lets hope AP can emulate mr wenger 🙏🏾
who tf is he
Lol my man will be gone before xmas....
Give him back!!! 😭
And Post- Apocalypse  🤣🤣
Ex will cry when he get Harry as new cb 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
New contract for Dier. There's progress for you.
lord, have ,mercy , upon us🤣🤣 got me on the floor for a minute
This guy is an adult who talks like a 15 year old .
Take our Greatest Defender of all time Harry Maguire for a discounted price of just 35M
It's true. Half the team is terrible. No Europe. No DoF. Worst defence ever. Not exactly an attractive team. Beggers can't be choosers. He needs to cut the deadweight asap.
You're overhyped for shit, won't be surprised if he's ending trophiless
Power Ranger mega-sword 🤣🤣🤣🤣
What could possibly go wrong. Levy's last stand.
Get in there EX true words big up
Twerk Twerk Twerk
Ange Pots of dog poo
How are arsenal mentioned so quickly in a new manager announcement 😳?  Talked about arsenal before the intro 😬
Can't wait for the Australian puns 😂
Tottenham r fcuked next season I hope u choke on Maguire, The age difference of Julian Nagelsmann and Ange Postecoglou is like Phil and the runner with that said Bon voyage Harry Kane as he sets sail off to sunnier climates
George and Lenny from Of Mice and Men 😂😂😂
Postecoglou plays an attacking style of Australian football which is quite unique compared to other styles in the world. The players are always moving and passing forward. It is a very relentless brand of football that has it's roots in the Aussie spirit of never giving up and being resilient. Look at the official symbol of Australia, it's the kangaroo and emu, the only two animals that can't take backward steps, only forward steps. This shows how an isolated culture and environment can shape unique styles of football. This style would surprise the EPL like it has with the Scottish league.
Ange “ Chopper” Postecoglou , Fam. Come to dish out some home truths about this shambles of a squad - Oz style
I feel bad for him, the man about to get his career destroyed in 6 months 😢
Hate to see him leave Celtic but glad he's going to Spurs. You're in for a treat.
it doesn't matter who is manager of Tottenham, they won't win anything
As an Australian, I will be supporting Tottenham while Postecoglou is managing them. I've been critical of him in the past but he has grown as a manager.  First time watching this channel and I subscribed for the future.
I love this man🤣🤣
More cups than Hugh Hefner??? Ex is clearly delusional for this one 🤣   Ange is gonna be another one that bites the dust like everyone does at the Tots!
Thank you Levy. From all rival fans 😂😂😂
Might b a fresh start with this kind of manager. Not so high profile. Last 2 managers have been a disaster
Feel sorry expressions spurs winning nothing under him I could win treble in Scotland
Postecogloooooooooozing sauuuse! 🤌
Spot on, more you think the better this appointment is. Was talking to neighbour who was underwhelmed - as you say have had serial winners mourinho and conte and had nothing to chew on but 💩sandwiches. Guy did great at Celtic, think he will bring loads of energy with him - is great platform for him to showcase his style in biggest stage🔥🔥🔥🔥
Last summer..you have spent well....and you were looking for the title as per the players signed and money spent...don't blame your owners...😂
The more I see of Tottenham fans online the more I am sure they really don't want to win. They just want to banter and pretent to be football fans on comfortable seats. Tottenham wouldn't be able sell out Highbury because it would be to uncomfortable.  If Tottenham ever in a position to win half would rage quit because they can't whine about being unfairly treated. This channel stinks of midely talented writer/comedian that needed a mediocre fandom.
Let’s all remember, many a good manager has come to the Spuds, and they’ve all left broken and trophayless, reputation battered. This guy has no real rep, so he’ll have to slink away with an 18 month compensation bundle, after Sith Lord Levy deals with him.
The last Celtic manager to leave for Epl was Rodgers and he got Leicester to two 5th places and their first ever FA cup. Ange strolled it even better than Rodgers. His football is unreal on the eye. He is uncompromising on his philosophy and will bin any player who doesn't invest in it regardless of who it is. Enjoy Ange, he is a ruthless trophy winning manager and will be a massive miss at Celtic 🍀
Your team's dead. Soften your hype 😂😂😂
Not even remotely excited or optimistic about this appointment. Doesn't matter who comes in. NOTHING will change until Levy is gone.
ex on form
Graham Potter 2.0
We need a rebuild, a long term rebuild.
Pressions is a waste gash
I couldn't care less about Spurs, but how refreshing it is to see one of their supporters talk with humility and a modicum of intelligence about this appointment.
Who is this SIDEMEN 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Like getting Huddersfield manager or Leyton joke
The day spurs will win like fa cup this guy will jump into space 😂😂😂
Half the squad will have Japanese or Asian players
Init I'm bare happy to have ange
As a Celtic fan trust me you're getting a good manager. Remains to be seen whether he can do it in the prem but he has made a career out of proving people wrong. Trust me his football is beautiful, nice to see a Tottenham fan who isn't on their high horse about this appointment.
This energy is different when the season will starts
Your bigger concern should be Harry Kane. Lloris is done & has been blagging it for years. & who know what son might wanna do? (Possibly after Kane has gone too?) Like I said you got more important going on than the appointment your 3rd/4th manager in as many years.
Can’t wait to see Angela Postecogwho cause multiple rages from this man.
Its gonna be the same story Bring in a Manager whos won a couple trophys screw him over with this dead club then sack him. First jose then conte now its ange's turn
Mikel Ar- tapas 😂
"It's a step in the right direction"  Is It?
Scenes when Postecoglou''s first signing turns out to be Joe Hart to deputize Fraser Forster.
Who ?
Spurs still have the same problem, regardless of who the manager is, Enic and Levy will eventually chase them out.
If you keep Kane then you stand a chance, if not I can see a dire season for Spurs!
Celtic fan, just trying to gauge the reaction to the appointment in London. This is the first source I’ve seen talk straight sense and move beyond vague/surface level allusions to the Scottish league and it’s managers who have come south in recent times. Honestly, though I laughed at the Hugh Hefner line at the start, I wasn’t expecting the realistic assessment of where spurs are at right now and what Ange can bring to the table which followed. Fair play, you’ve got a new subscriber who’ll definitely be back here for the journey next season!
Coming from Celtic fan you will get 2 things attacking football and entertaining football hope he succeeds hh ange
yeah he done so well in scotland......
That’s facts he defo has more experience that arteta no doubt
Anger postegulugolue is a top manager. Believe me you can see his eyes🎉
Don't need to get rid of everyone  Focus on improving defense and get creative midfielder  Team would be much more consistent
No wonder levels charging you guys double the ticket prices 😂. 190 minutes
Geezer won’t last 18 months, it’s de history of Totteringham Hotspuds  😂🤣😂😭😭😭🙊🙈🙉🤫
Why this guy always on arsenal and arteta if you have him on your team and doing this great things 😂you will be buzzing by now I know you will change his name right away 😂😂 but this manager suit spurs tho he will do his own thing buh when will make him a dead food 😂
The worst decision Postecoglu will ever make in his entire career, of all clubs ... Tottenham, Postecoglu will regret this bigly👍
All the Arsenal fans are behind Ange Postecoglou! Let's go, Ange!
The only thing Spurs have in their trophy cabinet is Expressions😂😂😂.
Am I prick fam yes u r look at u joke club 😂😂😂😂
re defenders, bit premature to decide what new fullbacks/wingbacks we need til we know what system Ange will play
What do you get when you cross a portaloo with pochettino???   Postecoglou
Hahahahahahahaha 😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂💦💦💦 what a Shame Manager 💦💦💦🤣🤣🤣👍👍👍👍👍
Lord - Have  - Mercy Upon - MySoul: the best back four in the Premier League next season😂 COYS!
If Spurs could not win a trophy with Mourinho, then they would not win anything with other managers. False hope keeps people going. The owner does not care about trophy. He only cares about profit.
Expressions is really exxpressive in the way he's expressing his feelings here. 😂
Makes me laugh how levy gets them every season haha
Ex, I'm an Aussie and I've been watching Ange's coaching for the past 10 years. The guy has won everywhere he goes: South Melbourne, Brisbane Roar, Australian national team, Yokohama, Celtic. The Australian national team never won shit before Ange coached us, we won the asian cup with him.  There's a story about when he won the asian cup, he showed his dad the medal, and his dad said "yeah, but you could've won before extra time it if you made a substitution earlier." Dude is a hardcunt. Please though, I implore you, you've got to give the man time next season. Much love.
Give it 18 months and Beyoncé will be back
*First thing Ange needs to do :* Convince Levy to sell Dier, Sanchez, Sessegnon, Lenglet, Davies, Winks, Skipp, Hjongberg,Tanganga. They are either atrocious or just not good enough.
I just had to come here and get his reaction 😂😂😂
Luv ya ouzzing...brilliant
It’s not about the manager. It’s about Levy.
Bruv ur going back to square one ur going back to a manager that doesn’t question the owners or ask for money but work with what he has…and imagine kane seeing this guy come in
Gerrard went invincible in that league I wouldn’t get to gassed 🤣
Good luck bloke. I reckon he'll go well. On ya Ange.
The only constant or Denominator is Levy, board and some of the players. Therefore regardless of who you bring the mentality that Levy and the board brings will not change.  Kane and Song needs to go. Jump ship
Apparently, Postecoglou is eyeing Harry Maguire from Man United nooooooooooooooooooooo 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭.
Crazy 🤣
Sure thing soon enough will be Angery Postmalon Who??? 😂😂😂
Ange HowMuchIsThatPotGunnaCostYou
Delusion at its finest,  Gerald had rangers winning titles and fired many within half a season in the EPL .
Good luck. He's a winner
About time proper coach /manager 😊
Trust me, great signing. Been following Ange since South Melbourne days. Great man manager.
Most of the managers brought into Tottenham have won titles all over, Conté, Mourinho, then when they come to Tottenham it's all over
I thought it was 2 years contract.
Sacked by Christmas. #levyout COYS
Can’t wait when ex starts bashing this new guy..managers ain’t your problem,the whole Tottenham system is useless,they have no clue..
Well said 👍
Ange Ange Ange ...... COYS COYS COYS  Aussie Aussie Aussie....COYS COYS COYS
ange POSTECOGLOOOOOOOOOOZZZZZZZZIIINNGGGGGG SAAAAAAUUUUUUCEEEEE 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I don’t think this bloke has 1 single Tottenham fan watching his videos honestly hahahaha
He doesn't waste money and he is a real Aussie battler. They love an underdog Downunder. He won't rely on Harry Kane and perhaps his sale may help the collective rather than the individual cause!
Ange welcome to Tottenham ....  Pls dont change Tottenham ..  Nothing against u, but v all want to be entertained by Ex .. win one, lose next will do too ... N dont u change the defense
Mark my words  We’re gonna be hearing ange Post nut clarity if he fails
I like the rabbits george!! 😂😂😂
The question is, is he better than Rodgers and Gerrard? Don't forget, Rodgers dominated the SPL & Gerrard went invincible in that league😂
Expressions is bare gassed!
I’m here for the ride he plays great football his only obstacle to succeed will be levy
1:17 Not doing an insulting impression was perhaps the greatest insult of all.
Tottenham fans We’ll swap you troopz & even throw in Ty for Ex lol
Man has mastered the art of cussing without cussing 6:47 ... Geeeeeeezzzzzzzzz
😭😭😭😭😭😭
ANGE POSTECOGLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOZING SAUCE!!
Bro shut your tramp Celtic doesn't need a coach to win the league
Nah you can't do Whitney like that bro...you guys been around the block more times than Kat Slater! From Alfie Moon all the way to Phil Mitchell 🤣
If you want some juice go look in the fridge Fam 😂
Your shit, always have been, always will be
Postecoglouziiiinsoooo 😂😂😅, this guy is full vibes
It will start well, then end badly
At this point Tottenham will hire anyone 😂😂 just seen a waiter from the bar at White Hart Lane stadium walking in with bottles of Trophy lager beer
i am a life long Celtic fan # Big Ange is a amazing Manager
Mark my words .. by December  He'd be cussing the manager And shouting "Fossil Football" 😂😂😅😅
Got LB udogie or something like that joining
Telling you now you guys are gonna love him annd the team he creates ,i just hope all the clueless ignorant fans apologise with the same vigour theyve used to slate him
Bruh, that mice and men reference got a rewind.
Greek/Aussie Arsenal fan.....I've followed Ange since he made his debut in his playing days......I'm gutted he's joined your mob......cause i know, he will make you much better.......he won't be worried about the size of the job.....
Looks like I will be subscribing to you expressions blood rather than via Robbie. As an Aussie I am torn, gooners forever but secretly I will hope you don't beat us but do really well under the mighty Ange.
Agree 100% on the defense, we only have 1 CB worthy of Starting.  Lenglet and Davies good for backup and thats it.  Dier just needs to go
ange will gut these boys quick
football revolution coming to white Hart Lane
4 year deal, Why? The players are the issue.
Ange will always be a legend in Glasgow. Good luck and goodbye. Looking forward to see what he does for Spurs💚🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🇮🇪☘️HH
I'm a Celtic fan, and absolutely gutted he left. If you back him you won't regret it. We he came we were fucked and he changed it in a season with the player he brought in. Your football want be boring he there, and doesn't suffer fools lightly. If a player isn't full on board he be lots them leave. That what yous need just now
Spurs mid table at best.
Postacoglou who?😂😂😂
Been through more man than Whitney in eastenders 😂😂😂😂
people laughing at ange before his job has even started, i reckon he’ll do good and improve spurs
AUSSIE AUSSIE AUSSIE COYS COYS COYS
This will be the fist manager to be sacked next season I have called it.
You will finish 9th 😂😂
Could be you lots Wenger 😉
Nuno : "I will make you proud" 😭😂
Whoever he is, he won't survive. Spurs need a grand overall. Kane will leave. He's hard to replace. Too bad.
same stuff different manager nothing going to change, and postecoglou won the treble in scotland, my nan could do that. Embarrassing!
Impostecoglu you know 😂 the Australian Sean Dyche!  As a city fan… I hope we can finally score at the the Spurnabeu next season
The amount of hype of Spurs managers "They always make something positive at their previous clubs" ended up ruin their CV 😂😂😂
Winning with Celtic and getting into the Prem's top 4 are oceans apart. Arteta did that. Postapipedream more like.
Spurs playing amoung us, vote the imposter out
With kane money buy Ivan toney n a good central defender
We need kamada n maddison
Anze has surname more harder to read then Spurs win any cup 😂😂😂😂
Good luck....can't wait till Angie 😅 fcuks up and expressions response 😂😂😂
Congratulations Tottenham
Aussie Arsenal fan here. And it hurts he has gone to Tottenham. He brought my local team Brisbane Roar to success in his time there and then only found success everywhere he went after that. Give him time and you will win trophies. Just don’t do your normal thing and kick him out after half a season.
As a Rangers fan I am glad Big Ange is away because he’s by far the best manager in the SPL. I hope he does a job for you Ex!
New drinking game, Watch Ex's videos for 1 hour and have a shot every time he says "dem boy dere"
As a Manchester United fan I love watch this guy cry when spurs get battered
Aussie gunner, I hope he does it well for all the other teams  accept us, mate
Respect mate got to say he will change something at Tottenham that's a fact gutted he's gone but 🍀💚
Let's Go!!! COYS!!!!
Sooooooo looking 👀 forward to what Ange does with Tottenham 💞👊✨✊💫
"Mans seen more cups than Hugh Heffner" FFS 😂😂😂😂😂
There was enough content in the 1min 54 intro..not sure why there’s 7 more minutes of video
U man be putting shrimps on the barby is man mad !!!! 😅😅😅😂😂😂😂
He could be good but with a lot of backing which I don't see under Levy.
Didn't see a Limp Bizkit reference coming haha
Step in the right directionless 😂😂😂
Well said ex
Amazing manager 👏👏 im gutted 🤣😫 good luck
I heard it was only a 2 year deal.  Ange will be here longer than Arteta this coming season.
The whole of totleham fans life depends on arsenal  they just cannot do without talking about arsenal
Just know that even gerrard looked good in that league 😂
Bigging up a new manager??where have i heard that b4?
Spurs fan from Australia, I’m loving this , man is a football guy can’t wait to see us playing football again
Arteta handing out more cones and cornetto
Expressions - you've just got the best coach there is bro. You're so so so lucky!
Hope he aint angey  watts from eastenders a drunk  u be ooozing anger
Can’t wait to see your reaction when he gets sacked in December 2023.
I just want to see us get out of our own half and actually attack teams again
THERE AIN'T NO WAY IN HELL THAT POSTECOGLWHOOO WILL HAVE THE SAME IMPACT AS ARTETA 😂😂😂😂
Postecoglooooozing Sauce!! 😭😭
Love the Aussie Open reference
At least he has accepted that Spurs are a small club 😂🤷🏾‍♂️
I'm a rangers man and i'm sticking a fiver on you getting top 2 the year after next
Spurs are going down under next season
How many times have we heard this from a Tottenham fan when they get a new manager 😂😂😂
Who the hell is he????????? Where’s poch?😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
A new back 4? Fam you're losing Kane and replacing him with Richarlinson
No top manager wants to go Tottenham its only because of there stadium they have had good managers
The academy had alot of promise how much have mason conte and Jose promote how much
If every Spurs fan was like Expressions, then Ange would do great, but they have fans who think they’re a top 4 club and anything else is unacceptable. Pure day dreamers
I love this😂. Bane broke him 😂😂
😂😂😂😂expression 😂😂😂😂😂 you are the man!!!!! Great spin on getting your 12th choice!!
ANGE IS THE MAN. BIG UP URSELF EX 🦘🦘🦘
What are your expectations for coming season 😂😂
I love how entertaining Expression can be. But I can't wait to see him crying and yelling come next season as always 😂
Are you coming to Thailand?
In a few months “GET HIM OUT BLUD GET HIM OUT FAM GET IT OUT BLOOD GET HIM OUT FAM
Australian billy bright from down under 😂😂 👏🏼
💩💩💩🤡🤡🤡😭😭😭😂😂😂
Bottenham Hotspur. Poor blokes first job is to make sure Kane's locker is empty
And from what I'm hearing good news out the club's official letting go the dead  wood
Oh hell naw
But you man got heated seats lol 😂 jkjk
If mourinho couldn't fix this tottenham squad then noone would
Best thing we can do is support our manager
POSTECOGLOOZ
Man needs to be live at the  Apollo😂😂😂😂
I DONT KNOW WHY WE'RE YELLING!?
😂😂😂😂😂ill keep this clip till death☕☕☕☕☕☕
He's originally from GREEK guys
EXPRESSION is the greatest YouTuber alive
Still laughing Ex tbh. Ex you don't have the players to play in the front foot.
Ex is a real spurs fan no matter how much stress he goes through all it takes is something anything to get him back and his the first to stand in line shout from the roof tops about his team or manager or players real fan big up ex I've watched you pissed and laughed especially when we beat you 4.3 but your proper Bruce Willis die hard fan old skool fan.
Asif hes happy with postecoglu 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💩
You can have Harry Maguire ! For free!
I smell another frank de boer.. best of luck in the championship cuz.
.....he won't last 4 yrs...2 yrs max. Impostacoglou
Mikel Tapas, Mikel Jackson 😂😂😂
Can't wait to see this clown complaining about him by like October 😂😂
Another failed manager at spurs a division 2 manager  for sure
Spot on mate....  We need to get behinf him now...
Celtic = Team Japan Good luck Spurs and get ready for Japanese football in North London... Good job Levy... Son, the time to get out is NOW. No one wanted to report to Munn (an Australian, ex-CEO for a China club, no European experience what so ever). Poste whoever, a fellow Australian, probably was the only one willing to report to him... And why not, after all he is making a lot of money for him...
Another Messiah going to take you to the promised land until he's sacked by Christmas.
Clown  🤡
LETS GO! COYS
RAZOR RUDDOCK WITH A HAIRLINE 😂😂😂😂😂😂 Arteta is living rent free in your mind
Even as a United fan, I like him as a manager, hope to see the Last Christmas song at spurs, but ETH is still the best
Still gonna win f all 😱🤣😵
I can't believe how obsessed Spurs fans are with Arsenal...They don't care about anything else😂
ex was just as hyped for mourinho and conte😂
Luke Skywalker didn't think much of Yoda at first but look what happened
Ahahahaha first thing out of his mouth to try and justify this 2nd rate brendan Rodgers is about arsenal
Scottish League is garbage. Gerrard won the title there. You are dead food.
I ran here when I saw the breaking news...   Unos, Duos, Tres !!!! 😂😂😂
Spurs fans get hyped over news like getting a nobody as a manager then are surprised when the club don’t meet their expectations
Thankyou  watching from Australia and can remember the glory days of spurs when i went to school in London back in the early 60s   I went to bed with a huge grin on my face   You need to do stand up comedy
Tottenham 0 - 2 Burnley. Get him out now bluddddd!!!
Que the hype from expression 6 months later calling for him to be sacked 😂
You da man. Love it. Ang minds me on Ancelotti, very calm and has players respect due to his nature. V professional and clear regarding what he wants.
Spurs are going to win the league. 1 day, in Ex's lifetime.
I can't believe I look forward to watching a spuds channel. Expression is entertaining, man.
ange holds the record here in Australia with 2 seasons of winning matches he is a winner and tough man
Postecoglwho who who who 🤣🤣🤣
He be sacked after 2 months
Ange who who blud expression 😂😂😂😂
He'll be sacked by dec/jan
This guys got more energy than 10 doube A battery's for Spurs 😂. Pipe down Ex. You were crying this season, more than Chelsea fans. All this high hope you have, you fan base is a joke. You can win the treble and still be laughed at.
Another one will bite the dust of Tottenham's trophy cabinet
Just remember this is a MASSUCE step up in competition, in capability, in intensity and in pressure. This is the toughest league in the world. Sp*rs aren't a small club anymore. It might be a step too far for ANGE
arsenal fan still, big up expressions
Bruh, Iv seen you big up Conte, Jose and Nuno at the start of their appointment..... we all know how this ends.
Aussie City fan here. Although rival fans are mocking you lot, i genuinely to believe you've found a gem in postecoglou. Ur manager position may be cursed at this point idk, but postecoglou is a brilliant man to man manager who at the very least will have you lot competing back at top 4 again
but Ex u told the don u will finish 5th and Assna will struggle to do anything 😂😂😂23/24 season
I will never laugh at a new manager. I am tired of the musical chairs with big names managers. As an Arsenal supporter I hope he sucks but not because he is not a big-name manager but only because I hate TotScum and I hate totscum. More clubs need to stop chasing these so-called big-name managers.
Postecoglou’s teams have always played stylish attacking football.   If Arteta wasn’t working so well for us I wouldn’t have had any problem with Ange at Arsenal.
Kebabs on DL ,Tottenham bonding with locals.
I wonder what Ex would mock or say about this new manager if he had a bad run😂
DW WORRY EX IN 5 GAMES IL BE THERE WHEN U SAY U WANT HIM OUT LOL #HERE4CHAOS 🤦‍♂️
Thought it was a two year contract.
If this all goes tits up this video will be trolled
Use are getting a legend expressions🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀
As an Aussie Gooner I fear Ange will bring Tottenham a trophy, it's what Ange does😢
I rate this appointment fam! Young, up and coming manager. Congratulations ex. 😂
No more 5 at the back football  I used to pray for times like this
I could win the league with Celtic 😂
👍
Sometimes you have to stink the place out to win trophies.  Support ange but do not forget  defense wins titles
I like Angelos. But I don’t want to see Tottenham succeeds.😢😢😢
Spudz are f**ked😂😂
6months into the season, Sacking Bet will come good 😂
I think he’ll be great
How long will he get? Sacked before Christmas?
https://youtu.be/HS0SUR4-vvI  https://youtu.be/JAxTnEL4_GY  This is who Spurs will be getting. Very good insight into his style and football principles.  Hopefully Spurs supporters will understand why the Celtic and other players who played for him will run through walls for him.
Spurs are literally the definition of insanity. They keep doing the same thing and expecting different results. Let’s be honest we already know how this is going to end. They will get knocked out of every competition before March. Ange might get another season but it won’t matter because he will eventually get sacked when the board feel safe and have run out of options. Then Ryan will come back in, they’ll hire another reluctant manager, then the cycle will start again. The only way to fix the club is to sack the board and levy.
he will be gone in one season only because levy wont see any improvement in one season
Aussie Arsenal fan - nothing to be laughing at. If there’s one available manager on the planet I did not want to go to spurs , it was this guy. I won’t elaborate too much, time will prove why.
This man has won more in 1 year than Spurs in 25 years :")
Oozing Dec 2023: Dead food fam! Get him outtttt
You man gonna have him jobless after 6 months blad
Another manager Tottenham are gonna break lmao... Mourinho conte are not shit managers but Tottenham made them look shit... Yes your not Chelsea they've won trophy's 🤣🤣😂😂
It’s good ur on board, get ready for some attacking football
Love that line I want a better defence I want it tighter than ojs defence made me laugh
After 5 matches We want ange out blud
This is how fans are supposed to react
😂😂😂 expressions never disappoints i can't wait for the diabolical spurs season to start
He suits Spur's level😅😂. Will be a perfect "yes man" for Levy.
More cups that Hugh Heffner
The only other club who wanted him was Leicester 😂
You know the old saying " you can put lipstick on a pig, its still a pig".  Postecoglou is just lipstick for the Spurs pig.
The man's seen more cups then tottenham. You dumb he managed who and in what leagues 🤔
Ange the dinner lady
He's actually a decent signing. He's a man of principle and morals. However, he's got a certain way of playing and needs players that fit his system. If Levy doesn't give him the tools he wants, he would walk out and find someone else to manage.
Yawnnnnn can't wait to revisit this one 😂😂😂😂
I couldn’t care less about who Spurs hire. Fact is you don’t have to be a big name manager. They have tried all the bigger name.
Lol ill be back when ex's black face turns red after 5 months of the same tottenham bottlejob fc manoeuvres 😂
Such a joke try hard, cringeworthy
Evri FC have got Postman Ange 😂😂😂😂😂what happened to a young manager 😂😂😂he's 60
You will fall in love after the first press conference I promise
You need to have built something in the first place before rebuilding lool.  Yidds and grebs happy with the appointment though while still protesting Newcastle and city ownership lol.  Spuds the only sectarian club in England
These spurs fan never learn.
1:41 🤣🤣
2nd game next season...who is this Aussie sideman bruv, end the stream I'm done😂😂 Can't wait
As a Celtic/Arsenal fan it’s a shame to see him go there, quality manager and can guarantee he’ll win yous a trophy.. if you give him time
Impostercoglu 😂
I cant wait to play this video in january when Spurs are in 11th place :)
Newcastle fan here.  I would watch you breaking down chess moves!  You are amazing and we need more Oozing!!
Another coach that can be blamed for Tottenhams lack of success 😅
Bro you’ve tried the Big names! Now try some of this 😂😂
Haha😂😂
Pussyglue?
Honestly, it's a really good appointment for you lot coming from an Aussie gooner. He's tactically shrewd, discerning, doesn't take any shit, plays an attractive brand of Football & coming from/managing in the OCE region has a solid insiders perspective of unknown gems to scout.
Kane to Real Madrid here we go 👋  son 👋😂😂😂😂😂😂
That Aussie Open reference 🤣 Best Football Youtuber on this entire platform fam
Lord have mercy on my soul hahahaha
Phillip Schofield turned down the job as he didn’t want his reputation destroyed
He'll be gone by March, come on lads its Tottenham 😂
You'll still have no defence. But you'll score for fun
Ex is amazing🤣🔥
Scottish football vs prem😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
A step into the abyss close your eyes and walk the plank Spurs
He we go again fans getting over extinct about a manger who let be real here has never been a manger of a top 5 league team how many mangers make in comeing from the Scottish league to the prem i Can thing of only one. and if kane go to man u or Spanish league than what he will be here 2 session at best and we will being doing the Tottenham manger dance again as for arteta he play here he was traning as a manger under pep come on it  totally different.
Massive celtic fan devastated to see ange go  over last few days  everything av seen u complain about tottenham this year had me in stitches this year watching you bro big up looking forward to more videos from you my guy it's a shame cause ange will fix all your problems wish him all the best at totnham and exicted to see the change in tottenham and maybe see expressions happy next year
Stacey Slater would've been a better example 😂😂
We're going to rock down two postecoglu and then we take it higher 😂😂😂
Good for you guys
Trust me ange will play great football regardless. Breaks my heart as a celtic fan
What I can tell Ange is that, don't over stress your self when things get out of control. Explode like Antonio.if you came expecting to win  a single, double or a treble at tottenham you're in a wrong place. They don't like winning.... So explode Incase pressure builds.🤷🤷🤷
Can already see Expressions be like, after a few games… ‘Postecoglu?!…more like imposter-no-glue cause it can’t stickkkk, Naah naaah Naaah fam I’ve seen more imposter activity in them last few games than them Man selling EarPods on street am I prickkkk…where is the cog in the wheel attacking football whhherrrreee??!’
Let’s go 😂😂😂
Poch !!!!! We always sucked vs big clubs .. he was never going to win big things ..
😂😂😂😂
Bissouma be on neighbours next
Nobody wanted to come spurs😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
postecogWHO??
As a proud Aussie Gooner, Ange will definitley get you away from fossil football.  He broke records in the A-league with Melbourne Victory (back to back titles) and something like a 36 game unbeaten streak with Brisbane Roar.  He also had us playing courageously against Spain, Chile and The Netherlands in our WC 2014 exit.  He then lit up the J-League and found title success with Celtic.  Can he cut it in the PL?  I'm not sure. He'll give you his all, but Spurs are so toxic that they may f**k him over like his predecessors.
next sacked in the morning
Big Up Ex! Hope my guy can do the business for ya.
This world class manager has been tearing up thistles in Scotchland, he has put the likes of Ross County and St Mirren to the sword. The EPL will be really worried now, he’s going to make thoroughbreds out of the squad of Donkeys we have. The biggest worry for us all is if he caves into the shower of shite that ‘want to stay and fight for their place’. God forbid.
Its something fresh and at least you’ll see some attacking football.. the days of conte and jose are dun out here...
Take mason to rangers and you will see mason ball. I don't trust that league. Lol
And to think Tottenham fans was saying arteta a joke for manger wen he played for a number premiership clubs and worked with two the best mangers wenger and pep and Tottenham go get a manger from Scottish league from Australia 😂 Tottenham definitely going down under this time they suck levy took all Tottenham fans for bunch clowns 🤡 😂 Gerrard looked like pep In Scottish league you lot can’t say nothing about arteta anymore especially wen you drop out all competitions 😂
Spurs need maguire 😜
He’s now retired from winning trophies
These impressions are crazy!!! He went in on this one
Flippen love this guy 😂
lol 😂😂he was your last option 👀👀no 1 else would go near your team 👍anyone can win trophies at Celtic mate they dominate every year 🤔
Postecoglouuuuuuuuzing sauce 🤣🤣🤣
Tottenham has a knack of breaking every manager that steps into the club. Postacoglou will be no different. Until Levy leaves, nothing will change.
Ex never disappoints 😎
Absolutely spot on  The Angel has Landed  Angelos  means Angel in Greek
He seems like a good choice but nothing will change as long as Levy is there … we need to take action !!!!!
Time for grilling pt 2👍
Here we go another embarrassing take. Loving Conte, Mourinho and co instantly but then demanding them sacked and out of the club instantly. Now you love him but watch you turn instantly you gap tooth fraud.
great manager, not sure our cm's can play his way though. we need some flair players with movement and vision
Mate I’m 2.54 seconds in………Ex bro let it rip!!!! Mad fan of the ooooooz for years as an Aussie West Ham supporter. Love ya work mate. Ange is here to smoke tha Premier league bro!!!!!!! Also a mad cricket fan…… but fuck the ashes this summer. Our country is spurs all day bruv!!!!!!
I heard 2 year deal with a possible 3rd year extension, not 4 year
I would venture to say the massive problem at Tottenham has not necessarily been the players or coach. It's Levi giving out his cell number to the players like candy 🍬 on Halloween. Levi needs to change his number and shut up and leave the players to deal with the coach.
Man said “a new back like Batman after bane broke him.” 💀 😂😂😂😂
Tin pot trophies in Scotland = tin pot manager. Neil Lennon. Stevie G, Souness, they fared well down south didn't they?
Patient Spurs: Trust Postecoglou    In the realm of football's embrace, Where dreams and hopes interlace, There lies a team of mighty might, Tottenham Hotspurs, shining bright.  Amidst the roar of fervent fans, A new era, destiny's hands, Ange Postecoglou takes the stage, A maestro with a vision to engage.  Oh, Tottenham faithful, hear this plea, A hymn of patience, let it be, For change takes time, like tender seeds, To grow and flourish, fulfilling needs.  In Ange we trust, his wisdom deep, A mastermind, secrets to keep, His ideas, like stars in the night, Must twinkle, sparkle, grow in sight.  He brings a style, a brand new grace, A vision woven with time and space, From Brisbane's greens to Celtic's crown, His prowess echoes all around.  So let us stand, with patience strong, Through wins and losses, right or wrong, For greatness blooms when nurtured well, In the realms of time, its stories dwell.  The journey may be filled with tests, But passion reigns within our chests, In unity, our voices rise, To propel our team to glorious skies.  With every pass, every goal we see, Ange's canvas takes its form, carefree, A symphony of tactics, bold and true, Tottenham's glory, a masterpiece in view.  So, Tottenham faithful, let us unite, In patience, love, and boundless might, Support the journey, trust the plan, For Postecoglou, our visionary man.  Together we'll ride the tides of fate, With unwavering faith, never abate, For in patience lies a victory grand, As Ange's reign shapes Tottenham's land.
Scottish football and English Premier league different levels Fam
As a Spurs Fan, I am hoping to win at least two or three trophies and every Spurs players to get 30+ Goals this season....  The manager we just signed is THE BEST MANAGER IN THE WORLD, He is worth at least 100+ Ms in transfer markets. Mark my word.... Quadruple incoming VERY SOON.....                            If you can`t tell... I`m trolling.... Ange Postahippopotamus is s**t... i don`t care.... i heard it time after time; from Jose, Nuno, Conte and now Hipoopotamus And on top of that, i`m hearing Deluded Spurs Fans saying Quadruple incoming.... smh
Whatever team Ange has managed he's made the supporters of that team proud to support their team, I can see him doing the same with Tottenham.
Every intro is fire and never the same ex is a genius
Let's back the man my Brudda.  Like man said in my video, anyone brave enough to take on this club and the Sith Lord upon high, Levy Palpatine, deserves All our fanbase backing.  None of us wanted Poch at the time either.  As long as man get to see Spence, Udogie, Sarr, Bissouma and Scarlett play, I'm jiggy like jelly.
This'll be even better then last season 😂😂😂😂
Why is this guy and his brother obsessed with Arsenal..😅😅😅
you have been here b4 ex
Who let the dogs out? Who who who who who🤣🎶
ANGE POSTECOGLOU  sacked by December
That who who who needs to be made into a chant
How long until he says out looooool
Apparently Brighton wanted Postecoglou when Potter left but he turned them down so that should tell you something as Brighton rarely put a foot wrong with recruitment.
Still don't understand why he gets so excited the ends  upsetting he loves setting himself up.
Aussie Man United fan. He led my local team Brisbane Roar to an A League dynasty. Spurs fans will love his style of play, just give him time to develop the team. Now supporting Spurs as my second team behind the great Man United
the "hope"  stage ...before reality hits.
Treble winners next season fo sho
Big up EX! I hope this is a turning point COYS
Still not gonna win anything 😂😂😂😂
just know
But serios...Who?
Attacking football I'm happy already COYS
This channel is going to be amazing this season. Spurs will finish 12th without Kane. There is going to be so many rants hahaha
I’m not even a Tottenham fan, but this guy is too entertaining 🤣🤣👏🏾
Wout Weghorst to replace Harry Kane?
We've seen this bit before, Expressions. Remember when you got Jose... remember when you got Antonio. From Expressions to Depressions in approximately 10 games, mark my words!
Spurs continue to secure the Asian merchandise marketing. On brand.
Ex is so funny - I'm not even a Tottenham fan but watching Celtic under Ange has converted me so I hope Tottenham do well under the Oz.
The same !!! It’s not changing !!!
This season gonna be a righ LAUGH 😂
Yes I feel the same as you, I defiantly want Ange to come to spurs. I feel good about him, also once all the bad lot are out,and they change them for good players, then we are back in business. Welcome to spurs Ange 🙏🙏🤞🤞💙💙
More like Anne Postanoclue 😂 Spurs going to be mid table 😂
It’s not looking good bruv
The fans will support him, just hope the owners support him as well
gave my local brisbane roar great trophies hes great
Ex.....get him to walk round the Emirates....on the walls and statues you will see success and heroes....then get him to walk round your ground Blud....nothing but condoms and beyonce tears...😂😂😂
Every manager you have had has more Cups and non after they were done at Spuds.  It won't change.
Love this guy 😂
the style of football will be a joy to watch for spurs fans. Ange ball is legit
Pls do keep, sell, bench and loan. Having a loan option would be better imo
As an Australian he is a legend here. Won us the Asian Cup and dominated our local league as well as in Japan. He is the MAN to win us SILVERWARE. Ange is from my city and he is built different, no bullsh*t. #COYS
The man's seen more cups the Hugh hefner 😂😂 I'm done
He never learns 😂
I'm glad Ex is excited. As a gooner I like Ange, plays good football with what he's had to work with. I knew he'd succeed at Celtic, let's see if he can make the step up
If you want something juicy go look in the fridge 🤣
Let's hope he doesn't become fossilcoglou
Terrible appointment this man head must be cooked. spurs have broke him 😂
as an Aussie im so happy for Ange but as an Arsenal fan had to be Spurs ffs lol
Lmao shameless settings 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ange postecogloooooooozing sauceeeeee 😂😂😂😂
Son out😃🤣🤣🤣
We see this video every year these days
Man must love pain emotional and physical
Joke coach
I give him 5 games😆😆🤣
lol..mikel tapas 😅 still served spurs up bit by bit
And the 🥔s think Kane will stay 😂😂😂
Ange=Angela?
Who won the treble...in SPL with Celtic. I'm sorry in a 2 team league it means nothing when most of the players in that division are championship level at best. We have seen managers who did well in the SPL come into the premier league and fail. That doesn't mean this guy will but he doesn't have top manager credentials or credibility, he is a big risk and not the sort of manager that would persuade Kane to stay (if he is thinking of going) or to attract top level players.
LETS GOOOO ANGE! WERE BACKING YOU BLUD☝🏽 Gotta give it to him for taking this dead food club. OOOOOOZING
Love the Aussie Open reference.
I am going to see how he does as a manager. We need to see how the team work with him before I judge him.
Pastacoglu 😂😂 Tottenham hire a new manager and the first thing he mentions is arsenal 😂 rent free
Who????????????
Who  Who  Who?😂😂 Expressions is too funny honestly..
We will support him..  we haven't solve our problem... Our big problem has always been enic and Daniel Levy , the recruitment of players and average players staying in the club for so long
Notification squad 🔔
Breaking news: Ange sacked by November..😂

Postecoglou will continue Tottenham's tradition of not winning trophies.
Soon Expressions Oozing will turn Australian in 6 months. Also wishing Ange the best of luck! Managing the Premier League is not easy especially since he's coming from the Scottish League
Love expressions man 😂😂
