Happy Birthday Doja 🤍🎀🩷💞🎂
Go girl😊❤❤🎉
There's really evil aliens in my dead brain torturing my soul. They are Catholic evil aliens called archons.  There is a demiurge evil alien in my brain who sings me lullabys and laughs when I'm being burned and hurt.  I'm being really abused as Jesus I genuinely don't know why Jay isn't having anything done to help me because I told him I'm being tortured by evil aliens who got into my brain after it died so I'm being really tortured rn.. Im stuck and I can't get out. I'm unable to do it myself. I need help with that. I think it's bc the evil alien in my psyche.
I listen to this a lot. Lol😮🎉❤🧐🫡
instead of this video being weird, it’s actually funny like real funny😂😂😂😂
As a huge scifi fan I died laughing at the aliens scene
That little villain is a great actress
Is there anyone here in 2026?
Hot take: This song would've been a much bigger deal if the instrumental  wasn't  licensed to TBell 🫤🫤🫤

Perfection.
This should be in history books.
𝐈ⓞνe
Somebody September 2025?
Her voice/style of singing was cool the first few songs I heard. Then it became clear her style is just a gimmick. That airy, whispering is THE ONLY way she sings...in all songs...at all.  Unfortunately I can't take it and just ignore them now.
Why was this actually so entertaining?
Star trek did not told us they released us a new movie
For my 18th birthday on november 21 2025 ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤👑👑👑💅💅🤘🤘🤘💅👑👑👑👑💅💅🤘🤘🤘🤘💅👑👑👑👑🤘♀️♀️♀️🤘💅👑👑🤘♀️♀️♀️🤘👑👑👑💅💅🤘👏👏👏👏♀️🤘👑👑💅🤘♀️👏👏♀️🤘💅

The talent has been showing 100 times over. Doja is here forever
💀💀💀💀☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️🥵🥵🥵
Doja this ain't very demure and mindful
Her voice tone and the rap made me worship this song 😭😭💔
She is the best of the best.💯💯❤❤
Costa Rico’- yuh!🥤⚡️🔥🍷👱🏻‍♀️✌🏻🌙🌊
Into it yuh
Can I just say, songs like this are what sets Beyonce and Nicki Minaj apart. Nicki refused to do a feature on this, and we see what a crazy b she is now. And how far Doja has soared despite it.  Meanwhile, Bey can try something new (for ex, Telephone with Lady Gaga) and show that the both of them can soar simultaneously
100 Million guys 🎉
Real son of Nicki 🎉🎉

Sve ove danasnje pesme su tralala truc,imala je zanimljivih pesama tekstova,interesantnih spotova,ali ovo sad kao i vecina pevaca danasnjice je smesno,a jos smesnije jer ljudi nemaju sluha,zar ovako nesto vredi paznje,odgledao sam dosta spotova,kao sto rekoh odalusao dosta njenih pesama lepsih,za koje i nisam znao da ona peva,ali generalno 15% je dobro sve ostalo je smece.
I am the ruler of the kingdom of the air

Mike Diva makes music videos that are so 90s, miss those times, bright-colored sets and costumes, cheap-looking CG (but in a charming way.) Reminds me of Scrub from TLC, Scream with MJ & Janet, and 90s boy bands, etc. Love the nostalgia.

\(^з^)/
01:50... Ok but ✨😂💀
❤MY FAVOR😘❤️🇵🇷🥰🥰🥰
Trying too hard. Bye.
0:50 😝😂this look
Not me thinking im listening to Niki Minaj because they sound so similar 😂
I love music videos like this. They have nothing to do with the song, but they provide a really cool/funny story. Most music videos are just the singer lip syncing and dancing, and it gets boring after a while.
The music video was ✨ICONIC ✨
YUH
doja cat making her men throw it back😜
This is awful
🔥 📛 👨‍🚒
Who's here in 2024? 👇
I just randomly thought about this song so I searched it up
An annoying voice
😂
Why the erie felling that doja cat could be a rescue from a doctor without borders relief that someone bombed 😂😮😮😮 someone's hu Waldo
(3) Cole: Mo Money (interlude); MIDDLE CHILD; also several songs on 2014 (!!!) forest hills drive are a masterclass in 3 syll (4) Kendrick: check out Sidewalks—it’s a 4 syllable clinic, esp. at the “astronomer, anonymous [etc.]” bit (5) Shakespeare, Wordsworth—iambic pentameter is everywhere in poetry. Also A$AP Rocky. (6) this may sound crazy, but remember “Look at Me!” by xxxtentacion? “Daa-da-da-dadada yuh” over and over
Who else memorized the rap 😭
The video: 😚😊👍❤️😗😃🤣 The song:👽👾🛸🥵😈
Nah I’d do this all just to get back say so if it disappeared

Love to soo 🎉
this song a classic fr
🍯🍫😍🔥
I feel like it's over as soon as it starts 😩I love this song 🫶🏿🫶🏿🫶🏿
best video
.
Can we take just a moment to appreciate the fact anyone who has put work into this was properly credited in the video description?  Very few artists or companies do this and it should be almost mandatory. The fact she did, automatically made me a hardcore Doja fan. Huge props fr.
First,Her skin magically got whiter throughout the video ? Her excuse to staying indoors a lot wont make you that white.  I barely leave the house in many years and im pale,not white like a harajuku girl.   I used to tan twice daily for 6 months and i dont get as dark as her in her other videos.
The fist part when she was in that elevator 🛗 😂😂😂 the way she say get into y’a 😂😂😂
Giving me Bulma vibes 🥰
NOT THE MALES TWERKING
The barbie movie be like:
Doja cat and her cat slay ❤❤
This whole video, the actions, music, beats are an entire vibe
WE NEED A SEQUEL.
THE CAT 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

“Thank you Nicki I love you”? Girl are you slow? I’m convinced this lady is slow… your thanking her for turning down a feature on this song and then stealing her flow and carrying on as if her feature decline didn’t matter just to later thank her on your song for stealing her ENTIRE flow for your skimpy second verse?   🤭🤭🤭 peasant tingz. I tell ya these new girlies are from a different cloth chillllle😅
I’m watching the music video in 2023 😂
This Song remind my of Asian Vibes😜😂😍

Is about rescuing a cat? Read me out... is it a metaphor how some uglass guy falsely claiming he has her p***y hostage to slander her dignity? Doja Cat pulls up,  proving no matter how many times or who shoots their shot she's been untouchable, and solidifying her self-respect.

im sorry but the way she said "if you go to church" was so pretty 1:09 ❤
Nicky Minaj Style
Tell me why the men shake more ass than the girls in this video do 😭😂💀 I'm dead bro
Any One in 2023?
this kind of songs came in Bollywood a decade ago.....
😂😂😂😂😂me and my little sister is home alone and we are cleaning while listening and WE CLEANED THE THE HOUSE IN SECONDS!❤❤
I’m eating Dragon fruit, and watching Doja Cat, while writing a podcast, I’M GETTING TO IT (HUH)

Whoever made this beat deserves it all
Then people troll old indian movies😂

I always thought she said ‘get a Toyota’

Get Into My Äśs (Ugh)
💃💃💃
I think  I love the old video get into yuh
You totally sound like a 5 year old in you’ songs because you realized that your childhood was horrible that when you were born yo’ mom called you a mistake and yo dad left faster than a jet to go get the milk and never came back for 69 years lol
real footage of my sleep paralysis demon coming to invade my night
I love doja cat ❤❤❤ She the best singer
She really said, "If she aint got a butt, fuck it. Get into it, yuh."
😮
The outfits tho-
anyone else think she was singing "Get into a yacht" ???
🛒
💴
🍾🍾🍾
I don't kick it
I would definitely do the same for saving my cat.
I thought I heard Nicki's voice on this song 😂
she turned white in the video  thats so kewl, i love doja kitty
TLC DANS
Devil worshipper
i miss this doja cat
Why's nobody talking about how she salute Nicky Minaj
None of her background singers even have a but
Lo encontramos. ¿Dónde está Starscream?.¿Grito de estrella?
I dont understand these lyrics at all. What the hell is she talking about.
Şarkılar en iyisi 🙏😁😆😅🤣
The art in this video is wild I will forever love Doja for her Naturality. She don’t gaf what people think and she grasped it and did her thing💯
Doja Cat is the Cleopatra of our Generation! 🌟✨ 💎
are we not gonna talk about those guards 💀
Доярка Катя! Мммм❤ Дай мне любовь, твой батя!
Yuhhh
Palo
Who the hell is that dude twerking  on his head at 1:44 I  literally died laughing my ass off .. like why??  What fantasies do people have  🤣🤣🤣🤣
Power Vibes.
What was dojas mind set when she made this😭
I love that she named her cat Starscream 🩷💜
❤❤รักเพลงนี้ที่สุด❤❤
in the bright spaceship, the gingers are dudes?
This video and song is life!!!! That slap!
ITS TIMEEEEEEE
It’s a nice song but the hell the end was 😂😂😂😂😂
E a louça, nada ainda?
yes, this is the doja that I know😢
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Hands down the best all male background dancer break down ever.  You noticed no one ever mentioned the male on male contact because the other guys were dressed like aliens.  Sexual exploitation at its best 😂 Great marketing Doja
똥고 원 피스?
I can't stop returning! This is hands down my favorite from Doja. The beat, lyrics, the humor, the set & production are all so much fun! The lady has so many sides to her, but her humor goes underappreciated, IMHO.😍😁
1:15
La lucha más importante que lideró Mamá Tingó fue sin duda la defensa de las tierras de los campesinos en la República Dominicana. En la década de 1970, un terrateniente poderoso intentó desalojar a los campesinos de Hato Viejo, su comunidad, reclamando que las tierras les pertenecían.  Mamá Tingó no se quedó de brazos cruzados. Se organizó y lideró una resistencia contra este desalojo. A pesar de las amenazas y la violencia, ella y su comunidad se mantuvieron firmes en su lucha por sus derechos.  Esta batalla no solo era por la tierra, sino también por la dignidad y los derechos de los campesinos. Mamá Tingó creía firmemente que la tierra pertenecía a quienes la trabajaban, y luchó hasta el final para proteger ese derecho.  Desafortunadamente, Mamá Tingó fue asesinada en esta lucha en 1974. Pero su legado perdura, y su valentía y determinación continúan inspirando a muchas personas hoy en día. ¿Te parece que su lucha fue significativa?
Bu şarkının bile anısı var dinleyince üzülen tek kişiyim hayat çok kötü
I miss her so much making videos like thisssss
Doja Cat Was Mentioned 4 Artist Like Ed Sheeran, Ariana Grande, Shawty Lo, Nicki Minaj.. Unbelievable Moment Is Doja Mentioned 4 Artist in one song❤❤❤❤

Wait what it say 1 like
Doja loves her cat ✅, catsiness is the Thang Doja beholds
Can understand exactly what she is saying,  it's half gibberish
Ariana definitely allowed Doja to use the word “yuh”
Esta pinche música enferma gracias a eya tuve que firmar un pacto con mi sangre con belzebú, gracias.
Me sinto uma maluca que não liga para a opinião dos outros. Uma louca que criou seu próprio mundo e não precisa de mais ninguém para além dela. Amei a música ❤😊
Loved her when she came on the seen. A breathe of fresh air. Love her attitude towards others. Love yourself and be yourself . Doja has that. Originality❤❤❤
This definitely reminds me of tlc hands up and no scrubs
At 0:57 😮 and 1:10 1:25  wouah ! Perfecto 👌 Kiss 😻 Nearly in Marvels 🦸
Me saving my cat when she somehow gets outside
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Gorillaz-Rock the house The Doji dance at 1:52 was as if taken from a Gorillaz clip. I write through a translator. But I will never forget the dance from the Gorillaz clip.
this was cool and funny
stop listening to her music, she just tried to trick you in to becoming how demonic she is stop listening to her music, go listen to the Bible, I put a Holy Cross, our dojo cat's heart stop listening to her music
I liké a twerk
True Artist and performer!!! Whatever anyone says!!
00:50
Cat Queen Goddess

Close to the ending it is so sus 😳

Its hard to hates her while her songs slays
I love simple songs that swiftly kill it
Kind of reminds me of TLCs video No Scrubs with the way everyone is dressed
Happy birthday 🎉🎉

I truly think its sad his Doja Cat doesn't get the recognition she actually deserves. She has THE most versatile range of genres. N every time she does a s9ngs shes owns it %100
Wassup

She been looking for starcream for  a while now
QUEEN❗️❗️❗️
this song will never not be in rotation and this video will never not be iconic
You gotta give it to her..,She’s a complete package & then some. Extremely talented!
How far I’ll travel to get some pussy:
I feel that wedgie.
I can imagine 1000 ways in which this beat could have been less interesting with anyone else on the track
A perfect Libra Scorp
Her minions need a clothes change 😂
I guess I didn’t watch this part of guardians of the galaxy
She was so beautiful 😭😭😭
It deserved billions of views
When she was not an devil this is what she looked like😢
Te amo ❤️

Love from india 🇮🇳
I wanted to hate this but I can't, darn it.  There's a little Deee Lite in the video styling here from the '90s too, with some late-80's story-vibe in the background kitty-rescue.  Nicely done.
Still a good song till this day
How did doja cat go from talking about church to the devil???
💎💎💎🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼24/09/2023
I hated the chorus. It drove me crazy. Now that I've actually listened to the whole song and saw the video, I really like it lol. She kicked ass for a cat. I loved it.
TLC No Scrubs type choreography
This type of songs should be deleted
Nicki is definitely Written ALL OVER THIS TRACK🔥🔥💯❤️
i’m going to miss this doja 😂
Doja me no Eagles 😢
Wow que bonita canción ❤dime cariño 💘😍💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋 atentamente erick Robin gracias 🫂❤️‍🩹

That verse was fire
Total Subscriber 1.2cr and views are in 7cr+...love ya cat❤
Just realised this is like Break Free by Ariana
I usually try to avoid music videos and enjoy just the music and lyrical qualities but I am SO glad I watched this one because I fucking love cats and at first I thought this was going to be some typical usual space battle with slaughter or something but doja traveled in space and fucking slayed her enemies dance team style and for a cat. I will never forget.... "Where's starscream?" Lmfao 😂 that phrase alone goes into my head from this video and I immediately wanna listen to the song. I'm glad doja also loves cats if I already didnt love her and her songs enough I love her more and she's so relatable also loving cats she's great love her lol :) ❤
omg 50 year of hip hop?
💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Bullet proofed like an getlin gun
We need more music videos that actually make it interesting!!!

Wth
I dont like her ber love her music ....
74M
What's wrong with her
the best part of doja cat is not the music, its the story in the middle of the music
I miss this era
I would not say "if" because what's left about this sentence would be followed by hell itself ( real Islamic teachings ) but "when" instead of. So when We will go to Church ( Glory to God ), I am pretty sure that me plus You will be resulted by *Miracle(s)* ...😮
Still don’t really like cats. Keep it.
Pop with truck
They say I just got a buck...
Why the f4 are her thumbnails red
Doja cat... You're so dope and you act very well 💥
Лучший клип который я видел
🔥🔥🔥
This was goated
Nicki should have jumped on this track! She said it wasn’t the right song and the right one will come along but this one was definitely it.
Lol
My favorite song❤
This made me vomit 🤢😷🤮
No call me adam gontier because apart of me wish I could just feel something listening to this song
miss this
This is my favorite.
Miss this doja cat
I love this old doja
Sponsored by life water.
Doja cat saves Her cat!!!
It’s hard to hate her when her music slaps
Es de otro planeta, solo el perreo nos salvará junto con Doja Cat
Always have bangers
This is the Doja we need back
❤❤❤
🤰🌈☀️🌑
This music video is about saving her cat from some alien b*tch    SLAY💖
Wait... Now it all makes sense in the light of this new leak. Nicki is supposed to be the ugly alien that she smacked right after saying "thank you Nicki, I love you"? She's really a 2 timed b*tch and I low-key stan her 😂😂😂
Like woman she like my woman  she dant know that
This is a 5th element nod if you ever seen the movie 5th element
@armonwiggins brought me here 😂😂😂😂
Do you know she is a rapper
I just learned today that Doja Cat is responsible for all the songs I like. I never knew she sang these songs. I'm a fan now❤😍
weird
why all the thumbnails of her albums became red... nobody talking about that???
❤❤❤DOJA CAT IS AMMMMMMAZING❤❤❤
this is about butt sex right
💀
Imagine if a sci-fi movie had a stand off where they dance towards each other how doja dances. I'm sorry but if I was high I would laugh until they start.
I miss this doja
.
So unique style literally can't hear it anywhere else until Doja decides to drop another song/album 🤣
1:14 i love this part ❤❤❤❤❤❤
how do you make, that your song are the best
Notice how many videos are about portals, extraterrestrials, and traveling through space??? They’re trying to tell us something…
My favourite song 😊😊😊😊😊😊🎉🎉🎉❤😂
If this was a movie I would watch it slay queen 👸🏻
DojaCat if you see this your the best singer ever I Love your VIDsS,sSSsSssSs Yas girly❤❤❤❤
😂😂àaaaaa
los mejores vestuarios y videos creativos de la historia
Her voice is beautiful 😮❤
This is the worst song i ever heard
She's so cool. And love the Minaj reference
😻
Get into a yuh
Is this the song from that one taco bell commercial?
Geef binne 'it (jûh)
Anyone else thinks the intro sounds oddly similar to G-IDLE's "$$$"?
The music video
Kinda reminds me of lil darkie at one point
1:17 hpt amo
WHY isn't this song like a minute longer???
😭
That was a chill cat.
DAMN
Probably the most underrated bars button =>
Call him Ed Sheeran, he in love with my body 😎
god damn the dancers had their whole ass exposed 😂
my songs and my vocals are way better the doja flop
⚡⚡💯💯
Господи, как же я орнула с водки Белуга😂 Вот, у самой лежала просто в холодильнике,еще с зимы наверное 😅
I was just wondering, does the howling wolf at the intro of the song has any meanings ? I heard the exact same howl in a bunch of different songs and it might be dumb of me not to know it but…yeah please someone answer :)
She shows us multiverse ❤
Sounds really gay...
Can anyone tell me why se deleted her previous video of this song and made another. Why no one is talking about it?
why she thanked nikki
Doja Cat REPRESENTED all the Cape Coloureds with her feet movement at 1:06 and if you know what I mean you know what I mean 🔥🇿🇦😀
Bars? 😂
I think that she likes cats
10/10 storytelling
The gen Zs love this song 🤣🤣
Love on the misu
excuse the format of this writing as I'm Genian not English so it is GOING to sound foreign like my second language  if you want to connect with the muses (females) and geisha (males) then you need to learn that it was me that made these works of art for the high class to perform  when you understand mental health then you will learn that it's my noggin that governed all this entertainment and coolness that I gave to the muses and geisha free of charge as long as they had the courage to sign it into their name❤❤❤  I crafted all of "this" to be tangy and fleshy and impossible for children to the clinical age to understand what us mature adults are actually talking about 😅❤
Her best hit so far
Why did she  change it to red
بحبها 😂❤
hasta donde irias por encontrar a tu gato?    yo:  🤺🐱
I LOVE❤ the way she uses her voice in this song.
She 2000s

Cute woman❤
All for the cat 🤣💓
Ha cambiado los colores del vídeo ? 😨 wtf
I'm in 2023
video reminds me of scream - michael jackson
😂
Go doja go
I always wonder if the cat in this video, starscream, is a reference to Olan Rodgers cat named starscream (after transformers) that was grey and long haired and died in recent years. Idk, chances seem slim, but it would be so cool if it was a reference to Olan and his cat
she’s  Copying Ariana’s perfume trailer video🤬
Wasn't the thumbnail a different color?
I hope the blatant product placements covered the cost for the dogshit visual effects
1:56
Eu sou simplesmente viciada nessa música, Saudades dessa época!!
Fuck simbolism
Oh Girl ❤ yah !!!
Tbh It feels like this song just came out
The almost one hit wonders use their sexuality. To sell records
T-boz + no scrubs + the fifth element + evangelion. I fucking love it.
Umm.  😮didnt the scene where the red hair. TLC NO SCRUBS T- Box.  Doji cat your videos are so colourful and you are to good. You don't need the sexual scenes Hun. You are far to talented to be have naked alot of amazing female rapper that are AMAZING AS WELL all you ladies need to do the kind of videos
Que pesimo gusto
Never really listened to this but that second verse went

Break free by Ariana grande if it had a sequel
She flew away then never come back
💯
why screen is red?
Doja você é doce e cor de rosa 😩
1:42  😂😂😂😂😂
I love how she shouts out nicki Minaj because Nicki wrote that verse for her, you can tell because of her flow. Sounds just like Nicki Minaj ❤
I listen to hard rap n every doja cat song is always amazing. Still listen to this like it came out yesterday
Omg I love this song 🎵😍
Love it❤❤❤

All her MV's thumbnail are now in shade of red 🩸
Почему все ее обложки к клипам стали красными?
Why is it red now 😭
sheeesh body goals
Doja make a video song of the cute fluffy cat and even the guy shaking booty like WTH 😭😭
when you see the album cover she changed all of them to red
Почему превью стало красным? 😮
This would be an amazing fucking movie some space crazy lady trying to find her cat that was stolen because some other villain dude fell in love with it at some sort of conference and then absconded off with it lols
Red ❤❤❤❤❤❤
fs
Roman possessed Doja.
Word doctor hife
Hay vãii
This is cool 😎
All right, but if y’all ship was being invaded, and they had no weapons, all the dudes just started popping they boy pussy on you. Wouldn’t you be confused????
starting 18 sec is not good 😢
Some parts is giving T Boz TLC vibes❤
I really love this mv, I mean her sidekicks did nothing but twerk and I'm living for it 😭
Her way of dancing is simply impressive, the concepts she uses for her MVs are unique and I love them just like her.  simply being something that only Doja is capable of transforming into things out of this world. <3
SHE'S SO PRETTYYYYYY
Omg 😱 I just fell in love with Doja Cat once again….. her creativity is top notch ❤
She reminds me of that one "rapper" dude who talks weird. Think his name starts with AR
yeah this deserve like 500m views lol
Doja's always sooo stylish...in all that she does...💙🎶🎤🎧💯💥🔥
why she says thank you nicki at last
SATANIC 101🤔🤷‍♂️

All of the product placement is hilarious lol
IF YOU SCARED MUHFUCKA GO TO CHURCH
Is that Y2K???
I love Song💖💙🤍💜 Slayyyyyyy ❤
Disturbing
Why Nicki not in this video? She played a part in the lyrics.
They're criminally underated. If this were a Ariana song, would have 1b views by now

i love this girl shes one of my favrotes
She named her cat after that trecherously fiendish decepticon? This is bad comedy                Yes, I know you've heard the "bad comedy" joke for the longest time now, I still don't care.
Ed Sheeran 😮 !?.....
You smart girl put indian instrumental song in Background music 😂😊
It's the way she smacked the kidnapper for me😂
Damn, what corporate commercial garbage. It's like a ring tone with stupid lyrics done by an AI alien. How about some real writing with some musical knowledge and sophistication. How about someone playing a real instrument? This shows what happens when someone goes all in on image and a silly stage name and then forgets that the most important thing is writing a good song where lyrics and music move in tandem to touch the soul.
Summer 2022 ❤️
My next Mass Effect character is gonna be Doja inspired 😂❤
Get in my belly.❤

temazooo
So funny 😂 ❤
Jesus Christ... It's no wonder Western society is in the shitter. This shit is worse than Idiocracy.
The cat tho😂❤
When I discovered Doja first, I used to hate her music. But now I am obsessed with her 😭😭
0:54 that scene remind me of “ the fifth element & no scrubs TLC” I said no scrubs because if you play that music video, you’ll see the same thing right there. Surrounded by clear walls
0:55 through 0:59 was iconic
Doja you are too funny!!
👏👏👏
Meow meow. Roooowl!!
เฟี้ยวเกินน
This comment is gonna get lost in the deep dark field of Doja simps and people who would give up their life if it meant something to her.
🔞🔞🔞💦
Her voice is deeper than Mario Judahs
this song always has me busting out into dance and such
ドージャの曲で初めて聞いた曲🤍🩷

1:14
пон а ты кто?
is the wh0re look a must these days? God...
So ridiculous
Водка Белуга?????
A very important advice, do not listen to Doja's songs, because they will not be the same as before. Beware, you will summon demons, jinns and bad things to your home.
she proves that you dont need to have voice to have succes
Uss Callister vibes
humans living is no more with taxes hahahahah okay, so we are destroying the planets and if any countries wanted to survive from endings, then start pay me taxes and i can save the countries at anytime hahahahhahah and its my powers and i wish then happens hahahahhahah okays so drop and lets try the magic atleast okays so ,you guys are not testing the matters hahahahhahah okays so test me and then we can work on the future projects hahahahhahah or darlings byes hahahahah darlings  .......
Even without Nicki, it's pure perfection
the outfits for the backup dancers look uncomforable😅
can i get some music recs of shit thats sounds like this ?
Look youngins, I got much love for you guys. I’m not intentionally trying to sound ancient. I dig this song and the fact that she shouts out NM, but…she needs to give some respect to Left Eye from TLC, who essentially paved the way from both of them. Don’t believe me? Check the No Scrubs vid from damn near 30 years ago. Just a commentary. Not intended to start a Gen X vs Millenial war. Love you Doja!
git that lifewater money
When your rblx acc gets banned: 1:31
She sounds like Nicki
I want her outfit
I love how doja does space related music videos
🧕🥰🥰🥰🥰😩💗💗💗💗💗💗

Why did she said "thank you Nicki" ?
is there any more stupid song then this
**wistfully** she's so cool
Doja on facetime with me
😂😂this song is so dope and the video so funny
A No Scrubs video for a new generation, I dig it.
❣️
Love the tribute to TLC ❤️🫶🏼😻
damn this is actually good
Not sure why you feel smug in this duet, but Mr. Homan is running the same excuse Southern cops used to arrest blacks for decades. Citing every black man on the street as a vagrant, which is still a statute, and fining each more than could be paid led to massive incarceration.
I love you you make me smile and laugh actually
La cancion es genial, pero el video no entendi pero bueno no me quejo
Love it!  😀

Your videos are amazing they remind me of Missy Elliott. I love her crazy videos in yours are Awesome love watching your Music videos keep it up.
What to sing sounds like moaning

Do not watch the video in slow motion…
This mv actually has a meaning like how starcream was cat-napped and this shows howwomen CAN do it..
Музыка норм, клип гавно.

BEST SONG FR
Excellent... As in all his creations... His spectacular voice and the visual details and the locations are beautiful... He should create a project based on an Amazonian empire, taking as locations: Angel Falls in Canaima, Venezuela. It would be fabulous and Doja has all her potential to do it...

This Mv is amazing saving a cat   10/10
ed Sheeran?💀
Doja Cat just proved that she would travel dimensions to get her cat back
Is she thinking Nikki for taking her whole flow delivery
1:21 she be right into your face yuh 😂😂
Recently addict 🍁
Me gusta mucho esta canción pero el significado es pendejo, pero el ritmo chimba
Fun MV😮
My favourite
Moral of the story: don't steal Doja's cat.
🪐☄️💕🔪
Got that big rocket laun-cha!
I love the short pink hair on her! She look gorgeous and this music video is super creative. Edit: lol i just saw the part where she used her crotch plate to deflect the shots and this is really funny ngl i wish some marvel superhero would sneak something like this in during the middle of a super cool fight scene that would be amusing lol.
0:51 Diss to Ed Sheeran
A LENDA
What a voice 🔥🔥🔥
Yo bailando sin entender la letra:😅
This is giving me TLC meets 5th Element meets Niki Minaj and I love it!
This Mv is a literal reference of TLC's "No scrubs"
I didn't think it was possible to pay homage to both Nicki Minaj and Star Trek at the same time... But here we are.
Jajajs
This could be a tv show or movie I love the aesthetic I really feel like Doja could get into acting
😻💎✨✨✨✨✨✨✨👏😌😌😌😌😌😌
I stop liking her along time ago
Wow playboi carti went hard on the beat
Its Star Trek on LSD! 🤣🔥

#BGISLOOKINGFORMETHANKYOU
Dog S.  My cats make better music
This song reminds me way too much about Taco bell.
No cap I just saw my boy Y2K in the clip and turns out he produced the song, no wonder i fucking love this song!
Pretty sad people think this is good music 😅 I'd be willing to bet in 50 years she will be forgotten completely😂
This is beautiful - Like not even lying
this song is so cute I love her♥♥
This is trash and she don't even sing ! 🙄 same shit I hear every 30 sec of the song that has 1 minute😂
Песня классная, но в клипе много жоп.

Mmm... Russian vodka, good! 😂😂
ah Daja Cat knows toiser and then she at least she is not racist
I recently started a channel where I sing .if  anyone has a moment would mean so much❤won't let you down !
Such a cool visual expression about evilness trying to take charge of your body, sexuality and creativity. literally trying to hold her "pussy" hostage. This video rocks.
My favourite part is when the boys were shaking their butt😂
i discovered it bcos my classmates used this in their street dance and they won!
Everyone here is now dumber for having watched this...
Wait guys why does she thank Nicky at the end?
The men tweaking 😂
A Taco Bell ad brought me here
The Cat is cute
My comment will probably get lost , but if anyone sees this I just started a singing channel , would mean so much if you have a moment ty ❤
What's Y2K doing here? XD

She a hottie
It needs some speed added to this song
SO AGRESIVLY
OMG LOL THE GURLS SHAKING THERE BUT IN BEGIING IS SO LOL FUNNY🤣🤣🤣🤣
She got all kind of red flags but not trying to cuff it, just wouldn’t turn down stuffing it.
What the 'Church' word for? 😬
I love  you so much ❤❤❤❤
I can’t believe people listen to this shit
I didnt understand anything she said.
Slaying them Aliens by twerking them faces LMAO
She gives me TLC vibes, specially for Tionne Watkins Aka T-Boz when she's wearing that pink wig, them moves as TLC video No scrubs <3
This music is as bad as mumble rap
Poor TLC
Without her cat she can't be called Doja Cat
i don't understand why this video don't have 100M views, so short and so funny , so happy and cute song, Nice lyrics and etc
Who actually enjoys listening to these annoying voices these rappers use
I like that song
I love she sounds like she just choking lol nice touch
1:35 Did you hear that breath?
This is so iconic 1:24

Great video. Couldn't help to think Doja cat's kitten seems to be worth the space adventure. And then the inuendo came to me.
Dam Doja Dominating the chart all day
Queen
Beluga? It's vodka?
If you ever wondered if human civilization was still peaking or in decline just watch this talentless horse$&%@ and you’ll have your answer.
Doja = Queen
Anyone know what the "Thank you Nicki" is about?  Had a cursory google and it seems like Nicki Minaj is pretty 🤷‍♂️ about Doja
SINGER LOOK LIKE HUNGRY😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂👎👎👎👎👎
Picard Season 3 looks awesome!
most realistic doja cat video:
I don’t know if anyone’s said this already, but this LIFE WTR commercial is 🔥🔥🔥!
Lol😂😂😂😂😂ahhhh Doja's best friends coming to save her kitty🎉🎉🎉❤
Whoever directed this video its so TLC back in 99 but lit❤
Best Doja Cat Video YET!
Cool song but why you gotta be so weird with the music video 🗿
If she ain’t got a butt, fuck it get into it..yuh. Bitch is gold.
Fifth element
I would literally be grateful if this woman would humiliate me I LOVE her so much-
This is low key the most garbage music I’ve ever heard☠️
the best song ever
Ok so I love doja cat, and I really enjoyed the video, but she kinda lost me when she started bouncing Lazer beams off her tits and coouch. Just really confused and bedazzled, if someone could explain this, I'd be really grateful.
Its already 2023 and it still feels like it come out 1 month ago.

Garbage music, garbage artist! This music is for non-intellects who can't tell that dumb me down music has brain washed you into believing this garbage is acceptable; for the purpose of turning you into consumers, that way the powers that be can separate them selves from you so they can maintain the power.
Te amo Doja
Her style just floors me everytime!  I remember when Nicki used to dress so crazy and it was my favourite style at the time and then she got better known and started dressing all grown and fancy and BOOM here comes Doja with unique makeup and kick ass style that NO one else rocks. She’s so unique and genuine to her personality and embraces herself and it’s what makes her so special and captivating to watch!🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤
I Get TLC Vibes From This 😂
wow you got a sweet voice. I got dope beats. emay me if u like Peace
This gurl should be in acting she expresses her emotions through her eyes so well
Ohh my God this song soo crazy and it's really soo amazing I'm soo enjoy it 😍 good job #DojaCat ❤️❤️
The way the boys were just working on that ugly guy
Shake that ass bitch
Amo este video, fue a buscar al gatito y lo rescato, la amo.
@1:58  "Thank you Nikki.... I love you"  Is she referring to Nikki Minaj?
Finally I could see straight acting man shaking there ass in a music video
La doja siempre superando expecativas
Now I want 🌮 🔔 😂
cat moms unite T-T 💖
thank you nicki  ı love you its so cool
no ass gang rise up
MIKE DIVA DIRECTED THIS?!
This is the opposite of good.
BEAUTIFUL❤❤❤❤❤
Y’all have ears to hear, not to actually listen. Cuz wtf?. And why would you “Thank” the Queen 1:57.. and hit a monster at the same time..seems “inculcate” and “clandestine” for a real fan of Nicki to witness🤔 Make sure even the producers are not chasing shade because it can come off arcane and ignominious on film. This is why it’s hard for Legends in the Entertainment Industry to work and do for up and coming artist. It’s hard to tell if the varacity from someone like Doja Kat is genuine. Why speak on Nicki while back handing the monster?.. seems a little presumptuous. Doja Kat can certainly be a raconteur, but trying to act like “Nicki Minaj” while acting like you love her for the sake of stealing her image as much & long as you can seems a bit much meretricious, myopic, and sardonic. It’s a difference when your solipsistic about someone you look up to. But being that way about an Artist’s image is kinda egregious. And can kinda come off as officious. Which is kinda what a lot of these young girls who are fans of Nicki Minaj come out the gate doing. Acting like her when none asked them too., maybe. But they’ve should’ve taken on their own images. Sounds, voices animations and all. Be Unique. Be creative on your own. My opinion. Because it’s already obvious that a lot of these artist pop out chasing trends. So the authenticity is hard to set a side and show their uniqueness. ✌🏾

This is so cool! Could you imagine the pitch for this video? "Hey, so what if the concept for the video was you being a badass space queen saving your cat from an alien space villain with the power of twerking?" Brilliant. 😊👏👏🤣
overrated tiktok ruins every song i listen too
This is a dumb song

I absolutely love this song but you can't convince me the music video is actually for the song and not just a pop star advertising a water bottle brand lol

I think her singing skills are great, but man, she REALLY needs to use them for something different. Her music fuxking sucks, and im not even gonna talk about the music videos.

Im getting that Fifth Element and TLC Srubs vibes!

Why is this more fun to watch than Marvel?
This is on par with Beethoven and Bach!
Something tells me this really is the song Nicki was suppose to be on. Just because when she says "Thank you Nicki, I love you!" like she might have had a verse for it, then was like naw? But Doja still kept that part in. IDK we will eventually find out like 10 years from now.
i like your art
this shit straight donkey dookie 💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥
If you kidnap her puss she’ll  attack you with an army of twerking hunk gays LooL

💓✨
1:35 is my fav lol
Better than DC movies...
No entiendo a esos nuevos cantantes...Si no salen casi en bola y bailan vulgar, no son NADA 💩💩🤬 Las letras de sus canciones, son estúpidas, vulgares y de pésimo gusto. Estamos mal, muy mal de, dizque compositores. Es como decir que Bad Bunny es cantante y compositor. Son igual de PÉSIMOS.
Белуга топ
Me thinks there's definitely some old school TLC inspiration there😊😁😉
yo cuando cargan a mi gatito

She dances, she raps, she atack, she defends... and, most of all, she has a cat!
I don't dig anything that glorifies the obvious.. No denying she's talented
Anyone else feeling the late 90s-early 2000s vibes? :)  I'm here for it. ♥
This is one of my favorite song out of all the song/albums this is my number one favorite song doja cat is talented protect the women at all cost ❤❤😁

No talent
Love her creativeness and her voice. She's just so amazing and the cat thing, we are on the same track
This makes me remember how good music used to be in the 90s.

Com certeza essa e minha música preferida.
Its meaningless but cool

Sums 😂
This is straight 🔥.
I’ll never forget the people twerking all over the Star Wars looking villans 😂❤
If playboi ft in this it would’ve been lit
♥️
Todos escribiendo en Inglés Yo: no te entendí ni vergA 🛡️

A little nod to TLC's No Scrubs video.
Nicki Minaj Style 😒
spaceship is running on renewable twerking energy
She don’t play when it comes to her cat
She gives nicki vibes. Animated and dope. Nicki woulda been gd this.

Star trek vibes i love it!

She reminds me why I love cats so much...
The praise of this song is less, in fact, Doja Cat has really given Amazing, Incredible and Adventurous performance🗼🗽🎇🌌🌠🗽🗼

Another banger. Well played Ms. Cat.
BELUGA!!!!!!
Once again saving the day with gibberish and twerking.. Gotta give it the thumbs up.
i adore her, cause who else in history has made a song encouraging people to still get into people with no ass, while actually having an ass?????
Her voice 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I wish this song had Nicki on it...
nobody commenting on the cat being named Starscream huh ✈
Pyranhas uitlacht ig video vs dit😐😑

Happy new year 2023🥳🎉

Imagine nicki Minaj in this video
"Hello, I am Sophia and I am a "Doja Cat - Get Into It (Yuh) (Official Video) " addict." "HELLO SOPHIA"
She have a sweetie voice
Idk why but every time I watch this video I absolutely lose my sh1t @1:42

Leeloo Dallas multi-ass
Balenciaga line 💀
This is terrible
Purrr
I love this song so much that I keep listening to it😂😂😂❤❤❤
0:07 so i think siren head is in the music video
I love this song but I feel like in 20 years people are going to say "wtf"
This is terrible
Wtf
I don't understand where is old music video,did they reuse the  'the one that i want' music video
Still think that this song sounds infinitely worse BECAUSE cardi B had to play a part it’s sad to see a good song turn bad with an unfortunate cardi feature
illuminate
female empowerment
give my dad's cat back
I FLY IN NEW DIMENSION!💫
For the longest time I thought she was saying “get a Toyota”
The fact this is about doja saving a cat makes me love her more lol
Doja a fine ass mallato women
Never thought that twerk could be one of martial arts moves
The fact that she went through this for her cat gives good love vibes.❣️❤️
Cool video 😎
I have a cat too🐈
TLC vibes yeah😎
Watse kak is dit hierdie?
she's so random and i love it
This is the modern generation for ya. What a load of utter shit
Why do I like this so much 😅
Still fucking insane that this is directed by the dude who edited the Mindless Self indulgence crack video.
This song is too fun. She should have released a full version video of it
Ya casi es 1 año cuando salio esta rolita que nunca le dejare de escuchar  🎖
Illuminati 😂 get into it
SHE SAVED HER KITTY!!
she rly would do anything to get back her cat 🐈 🍀
Wtf
She got heat and she's fine  when she gonna collaborate with Post Malone?
❤️🥰❤️🥰
How the hell is this song underrated????
1:25 damn sims these days are getting aggressive 💀
Cali
I love you Doja cat 💙
I need gay twerking friends like these 😩
My head hurts after this disaster, her mother should have swallowed
Get into it

Can we appreciate how they were twerking on ppl tho?
Lesson learned: Don’t touch her cat
But respect for 1:26 tho. My lungs could never

Ohhh I love this song so much. Its so nice. I've been listening on repeat.
I Like da 5 Element Vibez! 😍
She’s from the Lyrian star system! Those are lion people and cat ppl! This is an actual star system! And she’s definitely one of them!
So how bout you make it were humans have no eyes to see and the show u want they want to show u in though
Gx
Manz lost to booty 😆
What a very good singer she is !!!Doja Cat is absolutely great.
Call him ed Sheeran 😆🤣🤣
Her and young thug not far off 😅
The fact her cat is named Starscream lol
Love the Fifth Element homage! The Lilu wigs on the backup dancers, as well as the sexy Floston Paradise-style bodysuit uniforms, and then the familiar looking alien on the screen 🥰
What the Hell 😂😂😂
I swear I love this lady😍.. She gets me in the mood!!!
So good.
Whait so they stole doja's cat
DC backstage pls😢

You people have the worst taste in music
OMG todos haciendo tuerquink kshsksh
All the artists name dropping Balenciaga in their songs must be sweating right now 🥵 Love the song though
Is it just me or in every Doja Cat song there’s just amazing outfits? Like in this one, with the orange outfit then the blue hair just makes it pop you know? And the dress when your in the little cylinder room with short red hair, yeah the dress is just beautiful I wish I could rock it.
Nicki would’ve skated on this song idk why she turned this song down smh
TLC VIBES💜💜💜
The song getting my boys zestty as f💀💀
Dojas respect for previous female artist is so damn comendable.

Dalja cat feat Y2K =🔥🔥🔥🔥
She ate and left no crumbs
The realist most authentic bitch out here.

Just perfect doja cat
Wtf is she saying. Babababa!
I like that make up and this is my favorite song
This has gotta be the most intricate life water ad I’ve ever seen.
Of course she would, she's a libra
i dont care about doja cat but jesus christ this bangs
Female Kanye
🔥🔥🔥
Well she rescued her cat!  😀
Водка Белуга :-)
The sequel to Fifth Element that we deserved
Remember Missy Elliot videos used to be fire. They also didn't need half naked women to be entertaining.
ه
That was cute 😻
Doja did A good job with the song
This was amazing wow
I really like her. ❤ she’s a artist for real!
omg doja this song 😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
IS NO ONE GONNA TALK ABOUT HOW SHE REFLECTS A LAZER WITH HER ASS
🐱🎉❤
Can we talk about how she will do this for her cat ,i would to girll slay
Doja Cat  absolutely loves to block people  on Twitter  so please don't  even tweet to her on there . She is crazy , extremely sensitive,and gets irritated very easily.  I don't  think  she should even be on social  media.
I gotta say its great seeing women with natural bodies in this video. Doja appeals to everyone for sure, amazing talent.
she decided to make a mv almost half of her album. an artist and a generous one. love u doja thru thick and thin
hi  Doja cat
hi doja cat
Underrated music video
TLC scrubs I see she was mimicking left eyes part
I am astonished.
She literally danced them to death
Who's here for the whale nosies👀
Now cat is earning more than Doja cat....😅
Doja cat I always love you and you're sonvs💓💓💓
i miss this doja):
As a muslim I'm very conflicted by this I must pray
Is that even English? WTH !
Star trek but slay✨👁️👄👁️
Can we appreciate her creativity to show nudity in this video.
🎅🎅🎅🎅
What language is this? Lyrics?
the beginning sounds familiar it’s so good
Those mans can wap way too better than me.....
Take her cat she turns into john wick
Get into a yuh? Meaning anyone?
Worst song i ever heard
Sooo
This painful to listen to. Pure crap
Ok I literally just saw that one girl's butthole in the back on the left.... WTF. LOL! I knew it would happen eventually though...🥺😬😐🙈
0:52 tik tok
How much are all these mainstream artists getting paid to mention Balenciaga?
Christmas -----> Fart
The only piece of media I've seen with token white characters
Has anyone watched the last half of no scrubs by TLC and noticed the similarities with this video??
I don’t know what’s better Doja and that cat or the people tweaking and the background
This track slaps hard AF!
Your kitty cheating on you than u dancing and taking it back why it doesn't go well with human
Music is becoming more and more satanic. Actually this is not even music. Pure garbage-ness.
this song sucks
Is this a real thing?
Thank you Nicki!! 👑👑
i love how she is just trying to get her cat back i would do the same thing XD
The cat is named Starscream, cat probably got caught to take over the enemy ship.
BOP <3 deserves more views
0:12-0:17 sounds like a creaking door
Передаю всем привет из России!!! ❤❤❤
She need to make a song with Sada baby
Hard Leeloo vibes from the Fifth Element... Multi Pass. ha. Great song.
Who is here because he/she heard it from an advert as background sound
I only just noticed this was mike diva!
تره هيه اغنيه ماكو داعي طلعين شغلاتج 👽🔪
Somebody tell Doja Rat. She's talking too much cap with her fake pink wig someone's gotta snatch that
What the fuck is this shit🤣🤣
00:30 name of the girl on insta?
Someone explain me why she said - " thank u Nicki?" 1:58 🙏
Is this even a song. Can't understand it unless there's subtitles, bad choreography and meaningless picturisation. No proper tuning in song. Every other person seems to be getting famous these days.
and my mind syncing piya more for no reason ✌✌
I got this from my friend, So I want to pass it on...This is for you, MY FRIEND . Read this message until the end, it's adorable. I sent an angel to watch over you last night, but it came back. When I asked "Why?" the angel said "Angels don't watch over angels." Twenty angels are in your world. Ten of them are sleeping, nine of them are playing,and one is reading this message. God has seen you struggling with some things, and God says "It's over." A blessing is coming your way. Send this to  fourteen friends, including me . If I don't get it back, I guess I'm not one of them . As soon as you get five replies, someone you love will quietly surprise you... Not joking. Pass this message on. Please don't ignore it. You are being tested and God is going to fix two big things tonight in your favor. If you believe in God, drop everything and pass it on. TOMORROW Will Be The Best Day Of Your Life. DON'T BREAK THIS CHAIN. SEND THIS TO FOURTEEN FRIENDS

I think you should to a Harley Quinn video for this song you as Harley
nobodys talking about the thumbnail lmfao
Now I have to wash out my ears with some Metallica.
A very empowering anthem to being a self aware sinner. In other words it's empowering not even women but slutty ones  The further decline of western civilization
The dollar store version of Missy Elliot. Yawn.
bro thinks he carti💀💀
« I mean, y’all b1tches better « yuh » Like Ariana » love this verseeeee 💋
This song is amazing
Doja's Cat.
1:36 XD (Yeah....)
1:05 to 1:15
I don't know why but. This line "you got comfort shawty" this was the thing my rapist said, before he raped me. This is such a coincidence that this was in there.
Did she really just say , thank you Nicki? ?? For what her lyrics you be jackin? ?? Everyone can tell you ain't fooling nobody.
Que canción más qlera

KISKUUUUTYAAAA
The clip is disgusting and disgusting....
Giving 90-00’s Vibes 🔥
quenn
Her voice is so irritating lolol
I hate when artists go mainstream and their videos just turn into commercials, I even remember her saying that she doesn't drink, if I'm not mistaken ain't that alcohol ? Yep is Vodka, https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beluga_(vodka) Yeah I googled it in case I was wrong 😅
People still not getting into it 😅🤣
But yet she never disapoints
Okay I like this but when has blue hair with boys twerking and using her armor is just so funny 😂 🤣😭
This whole song is pure nonsense and TRASH.Why just why
This video is hot makeup is very fun! But the extras with thongs very pancake butt no hips but they are beautiful butt flat. Lol no harm
Talented that is what I have to say
Here from jbl ad
I havent supported an artist this harddd.. haha She inspires me!
She did this all just for a fcking cat😂

Give me Fifth Element vibes. DOOOOOOOPE AF. GWAN DOJA WITH YUH BAD SELF. Killing it as per ❤
I'm arguing Doja Cat "IS" thee best female rapper out now hands down. No one is as creative as her and she is making really good sounding music. Lmao! The alien stole her kitty!! Doesn't get any better.
Doja cat keeping the world alive and vivid with her awesome music,  her music selling like hot cakes killing it!!!!
fun video.
Buzina da Pabllo caminhou para Get Into it pudesse correr.
Janet Jackson VIBES!!

This song is stuck in my head, but I’ll never be sick of it
Dojaaaaa cat I am ur biggest fan I have all ur songs on Spotify this is my fav one ❤️😁😁😁

Amazing Music 👍👍
The clothes are only missing in the mid part of the body otherwise torso and legs are covered of those girls wearing pink. strange🫤
OMG she blocked the bullet with coochie 💔😭😂🤣🤣
Love this, lovely video and music that I have to watch it and listen to it again...
I know doja cat is really great af but how come no one's talking about the guys in 1:35 they match doja cat''s energy and they slay
Bruh am i the only one that realized that vodka is named beluga?

I'm vibing😊👏👏👏
Ye kaunsa ganaa hai bkl 🤣🤣🤣🤣

#GETINTOIT
Pop out with a truck (get a Toyota)
The cat is not famous ✨
I love ur content
I love it
Is this a prelude to Machinegun Girl 2?

She look menacing in the beginning sitting in a chair then starts dancing like a robot cleanly to the beat 👌
we aren’t talking about the triangle portal?
Hell yeah, this song rocks!!
Those pink bodysuits will be giving me nightmares!
finaily working video
Naaa u goated
1:37 why is no one talking about this?!
This video gives me TLC No scrubs vibes
This song is annoying in a fucked up way
🥰👌😍🎧🎵
Is this really what is considered music now
The song is beautiful but the revealing clothes I didn't like completely
Wtf if this?))))mb I’m to old😅
Sady
Siapa yg kesini gara" liat shorts
This cat is literally on fire 🔥😂😂....and she also tagged Ariana grande and Nicki Minaj if u really listened closely....she said thank you Nicki i love u for arianna i cant get it well😂😂
I have no idea what the video has to do with the lyrics of this song but I'm not complaining. It's still a great video.
I finally Googled the lyrics to this song because I realized I didn't understand it all. This verse >   Y'all need to get into the drip like a piranha Y'all need to get into my drip like y'all need water On me, it's only head to toe, Balenciaga On me, y'all bitches better "yuh" like Ariana If they ever tryna neck, I'll put my foot up in your caca Call your mama and your papa Like I'm finna take your dadda Turn that bitch into a soccer ball and rocka, rocka, rocka (brrr) Get into it like a suit And fuck a stack up like a broker  That shit is so smooth. I rewound it a few times to follow along with the lyrics.   Let me know if Google has any of those lyrics wrong.
Rewind to 1:05 while most replayed is the ass shakes in intro.
Yeah... I got a costume just like that for the swimming pool
Save the kitties ❤
So not a fan but my elder child told me to watch yet video and now I’m a fan 😂 save the kitties 🎉
Loving the tribute for TLC here 💞
i cant eat taco bell anymore less i hear this song
I was watching and at 0:45 I was like wait, is that Y2K, not realizing that they are dating or something.
I love you
She Used Young Thug’s Flow & Cadence On This Joint 🔥
The new Star Trek series looks lit.
Why did she say "thank you Nicki" ?
I love this musica Doja cat  Are is tha Queen  greets from MEXICO :D
me gusta mucho esta cancion
Fukit gehintuihyuhhh
Call him Ed Sheran he in love with my body😂😂😂😂
Wait! I remember a different video for this song🤔🤔🤔🤔
I wanna be her cat
🔥🔥🔥
I personally would pay those a cat for a lap dance when she's singing.
Just picking up right where Busta Rhymes and Missy Elliott left off
amazing 🔥
Интересно, до какой степени может деградировать человечество.. What a total pathetic disgrace.. I feel sorry for those fcukwits who admire this totally moronic atrocity.. I didn't know primates (baboons and chimps) are able to sing, but if they do, this is how they sound.. and look))  P.S. "Уберите этого сруля.." (c)
When I heard 1:23 yuh like Ariana And 1:57 thank you Nicki  I know this is gonna be fireeeee🔥🔥🔥
Doja is BETTER THAN NICKI😂😂😂😂
This video is everything! You're my current fave and i hope you will forever keep the uniqueness that IS your music and video style. As a goofy( but also soldier) girl, I thoroughly  appreciate it. Sending all the ♥️♥️♥️♥️
This is my favorite song
The cat was so cute but are you OK
Great.
I hope we can all agree that Mike Diva is a legendary director, especially because of this and panini
❤️💚
Why Gris have to sing this 🥰
Watched this while in woods and the siren head sound at the beginning made me absolutely shit myself
I don’t usually enjoy todays music.. but Doja Cat is a vibe I can chill to. I can’t get into mumble rap as they sound the same & the beats and tempos are all off. You can’t get off your ass and vibe to it yo. Beat makers today suck mostly.
Yes girl
Anytime I wanna feel hype I always play this song
The white chick shaking that small ass at :30-33....... didn't realize how disgusting it looks when you try to shake bones with a bit of ass. That looked really gross tho. Now I know why rappers deem the  importance to have a lot of ass in thier videos, especially if your your going to shake it. She must be a daughter of a producer, director or someone associated for her to get a spot in this video.

Doja Cat’s cat is named Starscream?
This gotta be the worst shit i ever heard. Sounds like she’s trying to poop
We 4 g y un I
Isn't this very inspired by Lisa Lopes her style?
that genuine nervous look the lizardman had
Wow 😳
Music in this generation is just pure crap.
Linda
Bro i don’t even know this creativity but it so unbearable to watch godamn how tf. Literally how is this something that’s trending these days tf
I love this Song
The best
I love how she’s paying homage to TLC & Nicki. Plus the 90’s vibe of video is too cute 😍💖✨
I love the part where shes carrying her cat while saying “got a big rocket launcher”

大好き❤
1:24
1:20
2:20
does it bother nobody else that the men are clothed neck to toe and the women are basically naked in the most unflattering way ? like why do the women automatically have to be sexualized ???
Strong "The Fifth Element" vibes 💕 love that movie
0:55 Did she name her cat after a transformer?
Ngl I would actually watch a Sci fi  movie where twerk armor and poisonous bitch slaps were actual weapons
I really, hope she wasn't serious about quitting music. As it stands, she is the best female artist, that I like listening to.
…screeching feral nonsense vocals. Some Joanna Newsom style rap right here. Sounds awful.  A hard 1 out of 5. -MCC  Like, Comment, Subscribe
When she deflects the hats laser shots she's literally using her perfect body to defend against anyone trying to zoom in and make fun of it... cuz there's nothing to talk shit about... she could go nude and they wouldn't have anything bad to say
Has snoop dogg blessed doja cat yet with a collaboration? She needs a new album with snoop and e40 etc
trash
Tf is she saying? It took me 10 mins to figure out a single lyric to even search this song, lol
54.5M
I'm an old metal head, but I can't shake this. I love Doja Cat. ❤️
💖💖💖now only I got this song
Muito bom. kkkk
It’s giving starwars vibes 😂
Mike Diva nailed this! Lovin' the video... disappointed it took me so long to see it.  Well done all around!
Doja is iconic 😎
0:50 everyone's favorite part

That's one furry cat
Also I just want to say if you can't dance to the song the moment it comes on there's something wrong with you
Doja cat make a song sound like gibberish and still sound good 😊
This whole song vid was about saving a cat LOL
Untalented
Looks like Orville. Same creature design?
Despite Doja cat being extremely weird, she is  one talented artist
Good music
You lied
I love how she said “foot in your caca” and “call your mama and your papa” I laughed kinda….it’s funny don’t blame me…😂
Yuh
I love this song good, vibes !
I love Vladtv father died
Mumble jumble

Mike diva made that crazy trump ad remember ? Lol with the trump robot that destroys the earth at the end ? Lol
OMG i looooove get into a yuh its like one of my favioret songs because it is so very cool and in this song the girls is the back are moving there body like no ather woman i had seen like i am so shock when i saw them and doja cat i just wanted to say that you are my favioret singer in the intier wold same for aaaall the other singers out there but you you are are one of the 1st place stars you make the best songs and.......i dont know what to say all im saying is that you are a star and all the others out there i love you bye oh yeah fucking get into a yeah

Please GOD can we have a sequel to this song?
Tbh, I would travel across galaxies if my pet was kidnapped by an alien too
Nigga

Am I the only one who thought she was saying “get into a yacht”😂

Lol she actually thinks Ed Sheeran is in love with her body

Damn the new Star Wars is 🔥💀
I love the music.😍😍
Так красиво никто ещё не показывал белугу🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This is fine
This is fine
Tarantino camera at 0:55
🔥
This annoying song keep playing in my Uber rides
I would do the do the same for my cat Salem. ❤
I have to be honest.... This is not really my style of music,   BUT... the more I hear from Doja Cat the more I like her stuff.   Cool interesting songs I keep hearing from her.  Also doesn't hurt that she's also very very attractive...(not the main selling point for me) but still.      I mean I listen to a lot of different things, I'm very much a music person, just not usually this stuff.   Hope she's a good soul.   Peace.
Sound like she copy Nicki Minaj.
0:21
It's been years and I'm still not sure if I like her music....
👍
Save the cat he is so evil
You have a cat
@dorkycabello I would too if I was her
Sh sh she is showing her but
Nicki Minaj is the reason all you got a fav artist
Why does no one talk about lyrics or things said. Why did she say thanks Nikki and immediately slap the alien dude. What's all this about
I hear so much of Nicki's flow style in this song. I love it.
🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮
Keep it up I love it so much keep it up just I love it dojacat #dojacanisthebest
SIMPLESMENTE PERFEITO <3
te amo doja por ti sigo estudiando
Get it into yeah!
It reminds me TLC times 🥹🥰
;.
She became just Doja for a quick second
This song was dedicated to Nicki Minaj
I am gonna be that dad dancing in the car to this song with my 16 yo daughter in 20+ years
Tlc and gorillaz reference
doja bala müslimisin
Frame by frame on this video is the funniest thing I've ever seen.
Gawd. This is one of the worst songs I've ever heard. It's sad I can barely understand what this cat is saying and yet she'll make so much money for being hot
Am I the only one who'd totally watch a Doja cat in space adventure 📺 series 🤔 It would be awesome 👌
Doja is iconique
А с чего тут комментарии одни иностранцы?
Slapped tf outta that fool 😂
Even goes on Taco Bell commercial thats how good this song is
This is beyond dope fuck I wish she would drop more songs with BARS
It's giving movie vibe    What I mean is it feels like a short and slay icon starwars flim
Mulher perfeita
Her singing voice is so unique I love it
Doja Cat, you mind telling me what you’re doing on that ship?
Sad to see Mike Diva editing and directing this trash. I thought he is above this brainwashing bs
Y2K what are you doooooing here?
ive been thinking about this video for MONTHS, and i just want to know why the fuck he took the cat in the first place bruh
Doja=Bulma
So good
My best singer, who agrees with me put like

01:05 scene turn me on, trace #aredisanengvillage #princedwahaza #gwmmk_takeover #dojacatvegas
I'm legitimately concerned about the English language after hearing this crap.  This is an awful song with an awful video.  What the hell do you people see in this artist?
Y'all need to get into the drip like a piranha Y'all need to get into my drip like y'all need water On me, it's only head to toe, Balenciaga On me, y'all bitches better "yuh" like Ariana If they ever tryna neck, I'll put my foot up in your caca Call your mama and your papa Like I'm finna take your dadda Turn that bitch into a soccer ball and rocka, rocka, rocka (brrr) Get into it like a suit And fuck a stack up like a broker
This song is a hit 🔥 n She's soooo Her no mistaking her for anyone

that last shot reminded me of the story of the Jamaican national hero, Nanny of the Maroons.
Get Lil Nas on the remix
StarScreams badass kitty
4 am and I'm vibing doja songs
Love the homage to T-Boz.
Doja Cat is real nice but what the hell I was just watching man?😀😀😀
🤍😉🤍🤍🤍🤍
Lil Nas Dancers joined the crew
You need to dip into my drip if you need some water. My bad I want to dip into your drip because I need water.
Apparently this music is kind of a tribute to nicki for everything she's done for the female rappers after her and how she's one of the most underapreciated and disrespected trailblazing artists of the 2010s. Thank you for voicing it too Doja
0.45 that guy look like y2k.
💋💅🏻💅🏻💅🏻💅🏻💅🏻
I like how this music video almost feels like a throwback to like early 2000s late 90s hip hop music videos
This song is so dope keep up the good music.
What’s with this trend of grown men twerking ? I just did 5yrs in prison this is not a joke all this shit is foreign to me.
This shit is fucking hilarious 😂
I don’t see anyone saying she sounds like Nikki! Because when she did that rap it definitely sounded like Roman but it’s only when Carti does some thing that’s when you guys wanna knock it. People have the right to be creative.
My 2 favorite  song of her  this song and boss bitch  she made for Harleys  Quinn movie 🥰😆
All her songs are wonderful, it's impossible to get bored with her
This... is not the video I imagined when I heard this song lmao
getting tlc vibes. 💕
OK udihwh
This music video is hilarious lmao
Awful song, Great video
Dojacat-verse
A moment of silence for people who searched Taco Bell add song
Most overpowered video of a  song i have ever seen
Proof that women are truly goddesses
This flow is so good....
Highly recommend the slowed version, it sounds sooo much more fun
#PlanetHER #Yuh 🔥🔥Listening 🎧 2 Doja's 🎵🎶SWEET🧁SPOTify🔥😘 #DojaCat💋💋✨😺💓🐈‍⬛🐈🌌💫👸🏽👑🇺🇸🖤PlanetHER🪐💞💋👅🍑🔥🔥🎵🎶🌟 #DELUXXXE😮💋🍑👅🍒💦😮😊✌😍
Makes sense that Doja said Nicki Minaj is her idol lol. Shit rap lyrics with zero substance lol just just like Nicki. It's just sad how bad female rap has become and what's even sadder is that people actually think these current popular female rappers are actually talented lmao. If you want to hear real rap by female rappers YouTube Lauren Hill or E.V.E. and you will see how bad Doja and Nicki are compared to female rappers who are legends in the rap game.
Was it just me. Or was that EXHILARATING
The lyrics are bad but atleast the song sounds good. 1000% autotone
Sounds like "get into a yacht"
Someone: "What is the definition of perfect celebertity?"  Me: Doja Cat.
I would do the same
Ain't nobody gonna talk about how cute Starscream is ❤️
Nick F Pauley!!!!!
Leave it 2 Doja!
This honestly is probably her best mv
I would do the EXACT same thing for my kitty!!  Doja Cat you ROCK!  And so pretty. 😊. 🤔 Thinking to myself if I could make that badass Orange costume for Halloween????
I just love how the crewmen scare them with twerking 🤣.
I'm so addicted to this song it's a whole vibe in itself. SHE IS QUEEN.
Video is 🤪  love it
doja is a jedi like jarjar is one too lol
This is soo Fascinating 😍💜
I feel like she got some inspiration for this music video from tlc and their music video “no scrubs” I love it so much ❤️
"Violence is never the answer" *Well, ass is*
Murdoc:omg my Baby
Om.. so we not gonna talk about how she used her twerk as a weapon??
O melhor clipe da era!
It's giving fortnite
1:46 when you equipped the Moon of Mahaa-Kalaa
Sexy ass legs spread lol 😻
Wtf 🤣
Me when my cat is gone for a millisecond:
"Twerking defeats every enemy"                                           -Draco
Industry baby I hate that song
Everybody wants to be as good as like Aaliyah Selena Quintanilla and Olivia Newton-John those are the only ones that pop up on my head there's plenty of other Legends but they can never come close to compete to be even as good as them
Obsessed with your songs
FIRE!
Wtf did I just watch
Yes, I love this song. I also love all her styles. She's the best thing going!
@0:45 is that Y2K?
Doja on top ....!!!!solute her grind
Bitch i said mooo!!!
This video Remind me of TLC. No Scrub song.
Linda
Made my day!

I like her music, I LOVE her comedy!

Doja you are doing big thangs  I would like to hear you in a sound like this here ➡️ https://youtu.be/92gHq1s6G-c It seems some people are judging you  But in  reality these are the types who  wouldn't  care about  you if you wasn't a celebrity.  and the other celebs are your competition 😘🐈
I love her dancing, she's a vibe. On top of that she's a talented entertainer.
ICONIC <3
that whole spaceship smells like a Chinese fish market
It's so silly funny and just weird😂😂😂😂👌👌
Honestly twerking on the enemy combatants is a genius tactical move, I wouldn't know what to do either
This song always goes by to fast I love this song
This had "The Fifth Element" vibes.
oyy blaaa
Sexy wifey there. Claimeded

I’m so proud to see how far Mike Diva has come.
I'm in my 60's and I think this song/video is AMAZING....what's wrong with me!?
This needs video of the year
I thought the lyrics were "get into a yacht"
Mike Diva and Doja Cat is so fucking perfect since they got like the same style. Genius.
What kind of English is it?
She basically rescued a cat with her pussy
MITO
If only this had been princess Leia in Star  wars🤪
What is she talking about
The Fight scene is everything😂😂😂
before i knew the title to the song i always thought she was saying "get into a yacht"

She's underrated (＠_＠;)
Hocama en sevdiğim şarkıcı doja cat dedim kliplerini izlemeden- sictikaq ya
try to copy Nikki and sounds terrible
We can honestly deduce that we are living in a society with An IQ level so low, that some of them actually like this song.🤣what’s worse is the people who signed her should have a hit put out on them!
She said call up Ed sheeran he in love with my Body 🤣🤣
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
This is the stupidest thing I ever saw. It's like someone tried to make a booty music video based on Red Dwarf....

OK so I heard this for the first time today on the radio and immediately was like “JAM!!!!” Who is this artist? And then I started checking out her other stuff and I definitely recognize the other radio hits, but this one drew me in. Lol I thought she started out saying “I JUST GOT A BUTT!! Get into it Yuh!” Instead of “ I just got a buck” lol. It was like damn well cool good for you and the new butt! “ haha

Doja Cat and her crew danced them to death. This is the kind of EDF we need. Forget the Star Wars Project. We need to deploy Doja-Force!
ICONIC ASF
THIS SONG IS EVERYTHING
好洗腦的歌
Doja isn't the definition of a star she is a star
I hope she keeps making music.
Is it just me or do you find yourself acting goofy and sexy at the same time while grooving to this song?

On my TikTok channel, when I dance live in my kitchen, people request this song. I came here to check it out and I can say that I have no desire to hear this ever again. I don't hear a melody and, in no way is this song or video making the world a better place for the animals, the planet or human health. Try harder next time. This assignment gets a D minus.
I don't see the point in this.
This is horrible.
You don't take someone's cat who has a spaceship.
This video is givin "No Scrubs" by TLC vibes. But i love the song Big Tome Still
Definitely influenced by Janet Jackson's scream music video
She sounds like she smoked 50 an hour
Song name?
Favorite part is when the dancers start twerking on the aliens like that shit was so damn funny
Obsessed🥰
Obsessed🥰
Kya bakchodi he yeh
The haters saying that she is the woman of a success, a song that brings out a song that becomes a trend and viral audio
The clip is Unbelievable !
Music is dead 💀
Piya more song me kisne use kar liya aapka song didi ..🤣😂😂🤣 Jisne bhi kiya aajkal bohat viral ho raha hai india me me to wahi se dhundta hua aaya hu 😂🤣
Dojqs music videos are always chaotic and hilarious
Did anyone notice in the beginning and in the middle her voice was kinda disorted?
ص

Gay
Not gonna lie this official music video is a bit cringey
"Get into it yuh" sounds like black girls in elementary school playing jump rope
The fact that doja's cat is named Starscream and there is a transformer named Starscream tho-
Watch my shoes
I love the cats name
TLC video idea!! Someone remind me of that TLC song 🤔🤔
I would watch this show. @netflix
From 0:01-0:12 it sounds like a fnaf song someone made

Finally doja cat is making some slaps.
Dato Curioso: Los dos videos de esta canción estan en 50M de Views. Dato Extracurioso: Con este logro, Doja tiene 4 singles que sus videos oficiales sobrepasen en Views a sus videos audios. - Say So - Like That - Street (Falta 8M) - Woman - Get Into It (Yuh)

YESSSSS! QUEEN 👑 702 BABY!!!
She got a vibrenium a$$🌚🌚🌚
I’m a classically trained pianist and I usually hate pop and rap and shit but I gotta admit I’m kinda addicted to this song 💀 dk why
The aliens at the end just crack me up, lol. And her cat is named Starscream, lol.
First video of Doja that I've seen. F'king loved it
*GET INTO IT YUH!~"* HITS 100M! (AUDIO+MV)
Disgusting
Thank you for making my fav song ever🫶🏻
Get into it yuh 😎 💃 🪩 🕺🏾
The video is more sus than the music itself
How can anyone like this song? It is so freaking annoying!! Like nails on a chalkboard!! Can hardly understand what she is saying. It makes my ears bleed! God awful!!!!!
Doja you act like feminist and racist you lead young generation wrong way
This shit is iconic 🙌
I love this song
Go ahead Doja Cat kill it
The entire thing was over a cat 🫡 respect ✊🏾
Hope she's not considered a role model. I'm 26 and what I see is cheap trash infecting young society. What really sucks is that this super shit is getting airplay.
Ain't this the taco bell song everytime I hear it I just wanna dance
I love how doja chose violence and comedy for this music video
Flat girls anthem 😂😂😂
Me encanta 😍😘😘😍😘😍
Can we all just talk about her butttt reflecting laser shots because I'm dying rn
This chick is absolutely disgusting

Doja can pull off any look, she’s a natural beauty ❤️
U r gvng a un  parallel fuckng yaa 😍😍🥰🥰
That was clapped back...
водочки мне принеси, я домой лечу
Yo tf she added into this song. It is addictive AF 🔥
When you get allegedly charged with battery on a police officer that didn't happen in a community and get 5 years probation and to your left really to left spent time with a inmate awaiting trial..who murderd a woman carrying a child and he only gets 2 year's probation something wrong with that community and then get a job working for the DHS something off folks
Doja kills it EVERYTIME all her song are hits!
I give it a 10 out 10 this song is just a master peice 🤌
She is so beautiful
I love the song too
I love your video
I think you don’t worth the life bad girl 😒
She gets better and better all the time, even in the videos I’ve seen before she gets better 🙌
The No Scrubs wardrobe references are absolutely perfect.
How Doja fight: twerk
hmm most replayed part of the video eh🤨
I love the the way that butt move I just want to feel it
Nikki Minaj wrote this
lmao he in love with the shape of you
Banger

Who thought the cow song would lead her to here. For the record she was hotter before she was famous.
The greatest 🙌
Artistic people like her and  lil nas be makin fire  music and music videos
WOW so sick 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
But why is she thanking Nicki?
I got into it.
SHE MOVED HER HEAD LIKE A FUCKING CHICKEN SOBBING.
banger

I always though that coi leray made this
Music is going downhill the more time passes.
I liked this song when I first heard it but watching the music video made it so much better 🙌
I have no clue what your saying mostly and still I love the energy .
gay
LMAOOO THOSE OUTFITS I CAN'T -
This song is literally radioactive. Like I feel like I should kill myself every time  I listen to it

SO MANY TWERKING BLACK DUDES ZAMNNNNN
If someone  threaten doja,s cat they better pray and get the hell outta there wherever there are 😭💀

This is the best music video ever. 🤣
I am so obsessed with this song and i wait for " Piya more bhole bhole" in whole song
I got this after searching " Ed Sheeran I in love with your body "
I find it amazing how she makes her voice sound like that.  Edit: I know she uses autotune but doja also has a beautiful voice. So don't talk stuff when that could never be you with that voice 🙃
Giving me TLC vibes ✨️ yasss 🥰

We can spot Mike Diva on everything that he does 🔥
i love how the most replayed is when the girls start twerking
Can we talk about where the shooters ained at?
One of the dumbest videos i've seen in a long time. Michael Jackson created art.
I love Mike Diva's work, so glad to see him lead a successful music video
I FUCKING LOVE THIS SONG!!
Wow IS so beatyful
Now i know shes a cat lover.
Thanks Mike Diva for that music video 😍

TLC Vibe 🤓🤓🤓😎😎😎
S
The subtle Illuminati hints are everywhere in this…
Dis sum starwars shit 🤣🤣🤣
This shit SUCKS
Poor men 😭😹
I have always said this, and I will continue saying it. Music of today is completely dead. This individual doesn't even make sense of what the f is she singing. This is the type of ignorance that are being picked up by the younger children and teenagers of this generation. The lyrics don't even go with this video at all.  Get it together people. Music is dead! You really want some good music, take it back when people really used to put sentimental value into the lyrics and even emotions within the writing of each lyric for each song. Today it is all artificial along with the artists. 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Her voice is like she is having sour thoth
Is it "Beluga" drink ad?
This song is so good when it appears on my fyp I can't help but click on it
This song is so good whenever I see it on fyp I can't help but click on it
I thought this was coi Leray
We all are nicki's son and doja is her daughter
Doja cat in the multiverse 😎😎😜
Am I tripping? But wasn’t there a music video for this song already?! It’s basically the “your the one that I want “ video. Starts with get into it” tThen transitions to “Your the one that I want” song for a bit, then goes back to “get into it”. Am I wrong or is my brain too fried from the shrooms and acid?
The dude twerking ._.
Tf is this trash😂
weird aspect ratio
Doja Cat rulez n she would do anything to get her cat back even fighting evil Aliens in Space😜. But Why fake Aliens 👽 in movies n music video albums shown are so f***** butt ugly n villain all the time. Bcoz I know that real Alien ETs👽other than Grey's n nasty Reptilians, look exactly like us n they maybe benevolent. Iam talkin about human ETs
wth is this music video
What the hell is she saying?🤔
Sounds like some upgraded Niki shit! Sounds amazing!! Ty 🤩
Anyone else get the 5th element vibes?? Lol
1:04 bulma <3
Lyrics   Yeah, ay Hey, ay, yeah They say I just got a buck (ay) Get into it, yuh Pop out with a truck (ha) Get into it, yuh (yeah) If you go to church I said, get into it, yuh And if she ain't got a butt (yeah) Nah, fuck it, get into it, yuh (yeah, ah, ah) And I say I just got a buck Get into it, yuh Pop out with a truck Get into it, yuh If you go to church Get into it, yuh If she ain't got a butt Fuck it, get into it, yuh (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) Yeah, you just wanna party You just want a lap dance You just wanna pop up on these clowns like you're the Batman You just wanna ball out in designer with your best friends You don't wanna talk no more about it in the past tense Get me out my zone, I'm just talking comfort, shawty I ain't give you nothing you could come for, shawty I got plenty things you make a run for, shawty Call him Ed Sheeran, he in love with my body They say I just got a buck (ay) Get into it, yuh Pop out with a truck (ha) Get into it, yuh (yeah) If you go to church I said, get into it, yuh And if she ain't got a butt (yeah) Nah, fuck it, get into it, yuh (yeah, ah, ah) And I say I just got a buck Get into it, yuh Pop out with a truck Get into it, yuh If you go to church Get into it, yuh If she ain't got a butt Fuck it, get into it, yuh (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) Y'all need to get into the drip like a piranha Y'all need to get into my drip like y'all need water On me, it's only head to toe, Balenciaga On me, y'all bitches better "yuh" like Ariana If they ever tryna neck, I'll put my foot up in your caca Call your mama and your papa Like I'm finna take your dadda Turn that bitch into a soccer ball and rocka, rocka, rocka (brrr) Get into it like a suit And fuck a stack up like a broker They say I just got a buck (yeah) Get into it, yuh (ay) Pop out with a truck (ha) Get into it, yuh (pop out, pop out, pop, ay) If you go to church I said, get into it, yuh And if she ain't got a butt Nah, fuck it, get into it, yuh (ah) And I say I just got a buck (ay) Get into it, yuh Pop out with a truck (what?)

I haven’t seen creativity like this since Missy. Everyone compares her to Niki but this girl dances, sings and has the creativity and fun Missy Elliot brought to Hiphop. She is definitely an icon in the making.
Теперь мы знаем, что doja cat пьет белугу
Is that y2k lol
This is worse than kid rock
So...this is what music has come too?
Was anyone else convinced this song was Get Into a Yacht?
What language is this?

Doha cat is amazing I’m so happy she’s South African like me
Is nobody gonna talk about why is the white hair girl sitting like that 💀
This is not Doha car this is black pink
This is so fucking weird. This reminds me of movies in the 90 that would show the future as weird and stupid. We are at that point
This is the live action remake of Space Channel 5 - I mean even the COSTUMESSS - if you played it, you´ll know it. Go Doja <3
yuh like ariana means ariana grande
I guess they letting anybody sing these days. I mean this song is so low IQ. Ghetto
Ayo tf did I just watch   1:37
Omg Doja visits panama
Would’ve been funnier she brought the ladies instead and if the enemies started dancin at the end too in their costumes instead of shooting.
I think I downloaded the wrong Star wars movie
me when I try explaining where the last cookie is 0:09
Can I get a translator to translate the verses of this song?  Thanks

CENTRAL CEE WANTS U
fishe moment
Doja has the Midas touch 💙💙💙
SLAY QUEEN 💅💅
I never get tired of it cuz the beat on fire, new high level
She could never hit TLC in the rump with a red apple. Gone is the real talent. There will never be any real music ever again in this world.
This chick is weird as heck. What a sick person she is. Just messed all up in the head.
Sampling from Battleship
0:53 Did she just mention the singer Ed Sheeran? What the heck?!
I love the beat to this song but I literally have no idea what words are being said.
How the hell is this garbage considered music
I’m addicted
Pl let her reach 50+m in this video 💗😭 onli doja lover will do this 💌💗✨
I love you!
I heard this song on the radio for the first time today. It was so bad that I had pull over because I was laughing so hard 🤣
I mean not a bad song by any means. But to be played on the radio so much and not even have 75-100 mil in 5 months? Aint much of a hit
Okay. But some of these TLC references tho 👌🏻
The ass power was to strong
doja cat literally defeated her ennemies by twerking
Wow! Ear piercing disaster.
RIP Doja Cat's booty  You were iconic.  You will be missed.  ( pouring out some milk )
So she twerked all over aliens to save the world? Love it
Slaying across galaxy’s

This chick is really talented. I've seen a couple of her livestreams, randomly, and she's funny as hell too
If she's gotta butt, get into it yo
Fake ass Lisa "Left eye" Lopez
wow  im a kid
This song is stupid… don’t even know wth she is saying
She sounds like she sang this hole song with a sore throat wisper rap then mumble rap bow rap sick with strep throat
She’s better than Ariana and Beyoncé. More creative and original.
With video you showed your mad dance skills.
The amount of strokes needed to make this video
“Big rocket launchA” best part
Left Eye vibes, no scrubs....
You are no 1
I call this the taco bell song
She’s poping
THIS IS MY JAM!! Am I the only one that thinks this song is not long enough!!??
Thank you Nick, I Love youu
This is simply put no good.
this       was      always           my    favorite         song      on        the     album        it         reemids    me        of      her       soun      cloud    msuic
Addictive style girl. Respect
Keanu Reves in parallel universe be like :

"If she dont got a butt, give it to her young" -doja cat Pushing that agenda.
What’s a song Visualizer
Got Damn this is a catchy ass song!
I'm not doja cat  something boys have got Doja cat in to see
She is real
Doja cat is a girl
How to defeat monsters:  *become a hot dude and drip for me, drop for me, drop*
So much respect for those women dancers because that thong  would have disappeared between my coochie lips
Let's get this to 50m views family!
but that lyrics though. Lol.
https://youtu.be/2hzv3PwwClk the world is going crazy. we ain't free as we think IDK what's so hard to give us equal rights why is it so hard to understand how long do we have to wait to be equal

Fuckin Awsome!
I came here just to say that this is the stupidest song I’ve ever heard
😃
Noah Schnapp the alien at the end
Those aces dancers sorry ladies. there with us. Mix of her dancer 1:45 Little Nax X Dance Hand stand thing is cool. freaky 5 star video.  🌈❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️
Best song ever! Girl you are so freakin talented! You make my day better ! Awesome! Stay safe
The aliens: WHAT THE FUCK?!?! EHSHFJDFEGHU “DIES” The cat: MOTHER! :D
💗💗
Like the song, but it's  obvious she copied TLCs video for "no scrubs". Took the concept , T-Bozs look, and Left Eyes look, and put her own spin on it.. Where the originality?  I'm waiting to see from artists, and movies, something that has not been done before....
Perfect example of music gone to hell
My brain just melted
Yolandi wanna be
I have to die soon if this is music
I thought Nicki Minaj had a terrible voice , I was wrong , this shit is annoying asf bruh
Where did that body go??m
the last scene is funny af
IMMA TRAVEL WITH YOU BC MY CAT IS THERE TOO (the music video has hilarious- ALL THEM CUTIES TWERKING IN FRONT OF THE VILLIAN LOL)
Is that Grimmes?
BYE IN THE ROMA!
LOVE
AS LOVE TO GIRLKIDFOR LOSE
what's stuck up in her throat!?
❤❤
I can’t get enough of Doja!
Now that's how I would make my team step you got this dojaaaaaaaaaaaa
When the  understandably  version
Most stupid song ever heard ....
0:50 0:54
Tf is this
Okay lil bright missy Elliott
I heard Olivia Rodpsycho is headed over to the mental hospital - maybe you can get a ride with her.
She’s totally channeling Left eye Lisa Lopez here      Kinda borrowed her vibe a bit and the video          https://youtu.be/FrLequ6dUdM
You need to to hype saweetey more tho. Love you both, but she brought you here.. thought y'all was best friends...?
WHAT IS THAT RED HAIRED BTS THING
Wait, what’d she say ?
I was at a Vietnamese restaurant eating shrimp and this was playing on the speakers 😭😭
If she ain't got a butt Now fuck it, get into it, yuh...
#nickifreakygirl
Shout out to TLC for the inspiration.
This video is giving TLC vibes
This also gave me major TLC Vibes👌
Then to be getting into it!... I dig it. BUTT!....never mind..ha.. ha..haa...ha..he.
I actually love this music video so much XD I would also go into space and fight to save my cats - fighting twerk first
Weakkk sound like crap
If you take all those ass & sexy scenes off the video, Then who will watch it? Sorry for Mainstream Music.
The cats POV: doja it’s not the time to sing I’m going to die- oh well
Get in my drip. 💯💯💯like u need water
Oh   I always thought she said "get into a yacht"
Fucking Y2K lmao...
Need a refresher on male control literally feel like wasting my phone screen everytime i unlock my phone
What the fuck did I just watch
I hate this song with a passion; however it absolutely slaps. Fml
What in the f*ck is she saying?   Music nowadays……
Me gusta el flowww  Yeeeahht yeaht
Love this video so much ❤️ 💖
1:22 “YUH like Ariana” the are truly bffs
I know all the bad word in englisch
Omg the boys are gay wow in the vid
So they're shooting at her and her armor reflects it, until that last shot which she deflects with her ass which isn't covered. Revealing that Doja is actually indestructible and wears armor purely for fashion.
Our self-esteem is playing with us.  The other girl is saying the same song from her perspective.
I’m Rolling with this and Taco Bell
Check out my dance choreo for this song, I do believe I nailed the movements with the beats. If you think I did great with my choreo please give me a Like.
I         love         the               song
I            Love       the       idea
I don't want this video's version of the future where clean, drinking water is a luxury.
Wow dis is 🤣Playbio carti 🤷‍♂️smh
This is my favorite music video ever lmao
Скоро 48 миллионов

That Aaron Long
Doing her best Missy Elliot impressions. lol
Qui est là après les deux meufs de TikTok 🤣🤣
I saw the "directed by Mike Diva"and was prepared to watch the craziest shit ever, especially considering who he's working with, but this was pretty tame compared to "Kazoo Kid" and "I'm on Crack "
Who's here after noah's video😭
Epic🥰🥰🥰😍😍😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Love it 💖
That cat is everything 🥹❤️🐈
Beat on point Doja killed it ❤️❤️❤️
Your singing! Is so good like I watch edits! And no one change your audio when they are doing their edits! It’s because your singing is too good!
Save the kitty 😂

This is my fav song
Olyan aranyos vagy kiskutya
its a scene from idiocracy lol
them girls had a bob
So proud of you
I'll be quiet
I'm dumbfounded by all of the overwhelmingly positive comments. The song isn't all that horrible, but the video? Come on people! Recognize a polished turd when you see one!!!
This video had me like 😂🤣😭🤣😂😀👍👍
1:35 they are busting it down so hard bro. OMG
Y2K is on her keypad thing in the space ship
Such a girlboss
This shit make no sense wtf is this garbage
Doja yendo a salvar a su gatito con el poder del perreo claro que sí

💀 “Dog this shi hilarious… I love it.”
this is trash music
💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
😄😄
Hahaha I love this music video😂❤❤❤
star wars but yassified
Manifested girl if you have a church ie heaven ship the cat symbolizes heaven and death cats have 9 lives and she sees the devil and is like o hell no you can't come on my ship and she uses rocket launchers I GOT THE BIG ROCKET LAUNCHER  shes very protective of her cat but she sees that the devils trying to get the cat the cat is dead thank u Niki I love u in the end shes sitting with her cat on the ship her face shes pissed like o hell no mtf the cat reminds me of mother bc one night she was dunked in water and coughed up a fur ball. I didn't give u nothing u could come for shawty nothing u can use. In stranger things the devil manifests and the girl yells ur not real you're not really here and the devil tries to attack her but she yells ur not real you're just an illusion and then possesses her body she comes back from the dead realm. This is traumatic
I’m sorry to my girlfriend but I love her 😩😩😩😭😭😭
I also used to sing like this when i was child.. Didn't know this can make famous also 😂😂
Love douchy cat 😺
Imma say it . . . .  this is her worst song
1:54 i laugh so hard 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😀😀😀😀😀
Pop Up Wit A Truck.
Congrats to 47 Million Views.
can't even understand what she is saying..garbage
I think I saw him hanging around Megatron!
I don’t remember this episode of Star Trek
Giving no scrubs video vibes
Guys twerking WTF
LOL I love how the enemy were so confused and start randomly shooting everywhere out of panic
I'm 56 years old and I'm just amazed that I real like her music
You k iw what Doja and Cardi B have in common , they bring the FUCKING FUN
i’m in to yeah…i just want too smoke out…
Just another awful, pornographic, ridiculous track. Great beats, and vocal, and rhythm, but just meaningless
I feel like I might be speaking for a lot of guys when I say I normally hate music like this…   But Doja Cat is the one exception.
Sounds like a 5yr old trying to rap. Can't understand her. Cool video though. But sounds like some weird child 👶
This possibly may have been the worst “song” I’ve ever heard… what the hell happened?
🦋🤲🥰💮💞
I love her I heard this on my way to work and I had to see the videos I love it!!  Doja u have a new fan..
Am I the only getting TLC vibes from this ?
this slaps harder then my dad pur
queen i love you
She’s so cute ugh😫
"If she ain't got a butt fuggit get into it yuh" That line touched my soul lol
2:02 o dia que a doja arrancou o nariz do vecna ;-;;
like how it kinda reminds me of tlc
She would travel through Dimensions to avoid media since she became a PEDO
Love how she's also considerate enough to appeal to the gay fans too :} those guys were hot! :}
well, i had to see for myself. i'm never getting that 4 minutes back.
🤣🤣🤣
How did the noise end up in my feed!
Is this a song people actually enjoy 😩 this is garbage.
Never watch this music video before very glad I did
Away team, set phasers to... grind. 😎
I need to know now know now can you love me again
Doja is my Faaav! She makes Fuckin bangers the whole trip! Neva heard a song I don't love 💗. Keep being that shut Queen
This is so 90's
Spitting out doctor's handwriting
Lo mejor de lo mejor 👌
Loveeeee
https://youtube.com/channel/UCPyvBaUGy-Jvt0qDtKRFsSg
So your telling me she makes songs like this and thousands of not then millions of people know her compared to other artists that have displayed better talent than her that people barely know?         This industry has become a joke.
I just love Doja's space-themed videos. I love them. Doja Cat, you are amazing.(^:'
She sucks!!!
The whiskey was named beluga :0 her cat is belug-
:v
I don't know what this song is about but it's fire
Doja be making hits but I want her do more colabs
I would do that for my cat too
I thought she was saying get into a yaht 🤣  💰 🤑 💸 💲
I'm a huge fan of you I even got a dream about you I'm 7 years old is that good the dream was about you right  met you in a party it was cool but is was a dream I love you doja peace out
But I don't like wester music
Sounding as if your getting strangled while you sing is what qualifies as good music? This is absolute trash
I've seen crap songs and people without talent, but what I just saw exceeds the worst reality of music please withdraw
My god was that even English? I’m just sad I can never unhear this disaster. Guess that is what I get for searching for someone named “Doja Cat”
She’s dope
👏STOP👏GLORIFYING👏MEDIOCRE👏 MILLIONARES👏WHO👏MAKE👏TRASH 👏MUSIC👏
Boys do not watch this if your not
Omg. Wtf happened to hip-hop
Mmm my princess
Was really looking forward to seeing you with the Weeknd, but maybe next time, get well!
i love you
A banger
Highlight is when they male dancers are twerking
Dafaq is that shit
The dudes twerkin did it for me 😑💀💀💀💀💀💀
I would travel to different places jsut to get to my cat to-
I'm not sure if this is music 😂
Did she ever hit up Joseph?
Меньше 4 миллионов до 50 миллионов просмотров
Делаем 50 миллионов
This song reminds me of my humor 😁
Уже 46 миллионов
My fave part is when all those guys were twerking, its very hard to do so and they made it look easy
Music and cosplay in the mix = Sexy
Her "voice" is terrible... for me at least.
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
😍🤩
Really!!!  So now  anyone can sing another bad bunny crap
Buhahahahahaha MJ JJ Busta unique nah
creo que en la 5ta temporada de #strangerthings necesitamos una doja cat peleando contra vecna😊
Doja when you going to propose to me. I’m the one no digits but I ain’t here to fuck up business
TLC x Lil Nas X
HOLY SHIT THE CATS A FUCKING DECEPTICON!!!
TLC vibes!
You are losing so many fans for being rude to a child
XOXO LÛVÅBLÉS 😘💋💋
Wtf
at this point im just waiting for doja to appear in the MCU
Left eye vibes
Lol true
What the hell is she even saying
I love her loving on her women singer idols. Perfect 🥰
So she  get gay People
Hola  dona Cat
The new Nikki
Well you dont use people as gos to discover people and places youve never been to it aint free.
Straight outta galaxy quest lol
Video is lit! hahaha Doja is ma gurl aliens got her cat
peytton
❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
I imagine this is what the voice in my ex's head sounded like
Imagery is disgusting everytime I see those twerking over sexualized bodies it reminds me of the silent hill 2 monster called “lying figure”
I just wanna say that I would totally believe that this was happening in the "Joji sanctuary" universe. #jojianddoja
This is terrible.
Hi
garbage
Team Noah
I came from taco bell
Watching this I think she would be a great actress😘😘😘 lot's of love Doja
You a whole L. Team Noah
Holy Biblical holy holy cow 🐮
Get into Joseph Quinn's (Eddie Munson) DM's yuh!!!🤣🤣🤣
Man,I thought it was a China chick singing thus on the radio!! Lmao
Seems like so much old school Oakland in these voices
The flamego I is cool but not a Nikki  cool she payed respect  lol but she still my flamego
Love u girl I’m a fan
I think Tboz wore it best….
Would tear that milk chocolate 🍫 up
i like doja even more bc shes a cat person lol
Crazy ass song with video to match
No sé por qué me emociono cuando salva a su gatito 🥺
Who's here after Noah put her on blast? 🤣🤣😂😅
0:51 my favourite part

Parts of this video is giving me TLC no scrubs visuals.
Doja cats cat is soooooooooooooo cut
ATEE‼️‼️‼️💋💋💋💋
.
KITTY
HERMOSA   MÚSICA   LA  QUIERO  MUCHO 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😘😘😘❤
Nudez para a idade isso é errado
Anybody know what these lyrics mean?
I’m just blown away by her, her musical talents, and her music videos!! These galactic/space girl/Star Trek vibes (also in ‘need to know’) are what I need on a daily basis. Plz I need a space sci-fi movie inspired by this magic and her featured in the movie as herself: a talented artist! Just like in the movie Valerian when Rhianna was cast as herself: a singer.
Terrible
Doja cat love her cats so don’t mess with her   ( editing this 3 years later is insane for me )
She went to the same high school as my ex and d savage
Funny but weird as hell
The new Queen of the galaxy may the force be with you
Artist of the decade
Dak prescott and natalie buffet white girl tapes with sponsers,,, endorsements,,,
ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
This is prepredictive programming folks, beware ☯️
I’m gonna try to sing your song
Sounds devilish and creepy
So this is my first time watching the video to this song. 10/10. Loved the part where lasers were deflected off a literal butt.
this is the stupidest song by the least talented artist on the planet  i remember when real music was actually made.  this generation likes anything that has an electronically altered voice to sound like Alvin and the Chipmunks 😂  sad
When you don’t have talent singing so you gotta shake the only thing of value, my heart goes out to the audio listeners
TLC No scrubs vibes ✌
This makes me wanna be a transvestite 😍
You may abduct me any time you’d like Doja…
Hi
Le
If she on drugs then I’m cool with that just keep making them hits 😂
When someone asks my sexuality, I’m sending them this video😅
Yikes. The song doesn't sound like the video. Missy Elliott is that.
I love you so much that I played your song in school 😂😂💗
Not tryna hate or anything but who the hell told you you were good at singing 💀💀💀
Bro just gets some shorts on or sm we don’t wanna see that
WHAT KIND OF CAT IS STARSCREAM????
1:36 the men, anyways so
6 months later and I still don’t know wtf a Yuh is.
Check my song out "Strangers" if you miss her!!
\this songs funny level is 1000000000000000000000000000000000%
I'm obsessed lol
Me encanta 😍 no lo dejo de escuchar 💃
She's  gorgeous  talented  and creative as fuck 😍😍
Heard this on the radio and thought it was a new Nicki Minaj song. Much respect to whoever that can copy that good.
oh yes i love this and im so happy she got her kitty back!
GORGEOUS .
GORGEOUS .
Tik tok
Hola
the look she gives him at 0:58 lmao
Thank You, Nicki!
Este video esta a otro level

Garbage song and video

A music video has no business being this funny

Doja just do what joji does and go complete  Mia and not give af about us worrying cuz you know you will drop good ass songs that we will all listen too maybe do a song with joji and call is a doji cat collab lol
slay
This video and song definitely exist in the same as TLC No Scrubs and Michael and Janet Jackson Scream with Chris Brown and lil Mama shorty get loose! She’s in on own area of the ship killing it.
Reminds me of a 90s video.
GET INTO IT YUH!
Gettin toya!
This song is awesome with mushrooms
Sympas ce titre
Loveeeeee Doja!
I LOVE this vid!

800 billion likes

That was the easiest fight Doja had to do , all she did was smack the leader and he was dead 😂😂😂
This is amazing! But i listen to the lyrics and I'm like whaat? Can anyone explain me wtf the lyrics mean?:))
dreadful
"the armor" gag still gets me when it's done right apparently xd

Doka cat可愛すぎる✨
Don't forget
Yo why does Doja cat sound like a baby that smokes
I'm leaving this comment here in a hope that whenever someone likes it, I'll be reminded of this masterpiece
Doja cat *pacman sounds*
Is just good 😍
''if she aint gotta buhh, get into it yuhh'', what does that mean exactly?  i like buhhs.  if she dun have a buhh i could just get into another, yuhh?  why should i be satisfied with no buhh?   ''but u like a b wit no a, u aint got s'' -lil wayne oh wait i think i get it.  if she aint got a buhh,  put it in her buhh?  like a punishment for being lazy?  lmao
The fact that the men twerk all over the bad guys!!! OMG I LOVE IT!!
Kiskutya 😅😅❤️❤️
Doja cat is the hottest alien. Also, all her videos are so high quality, I don’t know what to appreciate more 😅
She slayed this bro ong 🤩😍
Какая офигенная фигня)))!
God this sucks
All that to slap Nicky
TLC hommage
I feel like there needs to be like a TLC cameo in one of her futuristic videos b/c I'm getting Anime/TLC/ 90's vibe..😻
Most beautiful woman alive or dead,I got that big rocket launcher... Just wish I could give it to her😅😅
I like a lot of Dojas music, but her voice is very annoying in this song.
I love your videos, they’re super creative
I hear this song at work from time to time and it’s fucking trash.
Doja: mumble rap?…… hold my beer
Pov:  us when someone tries to kidnap our pets
quynh always says "ur like a cyberpunk egirl" LMFAOOO
That's it I'm naming my kitty starscream now and no one is gonna stop me
Aquí una que no sabe ni merga que es lo que dice, pero amando siempre sus canciones. 🔥❤🇩🇴
0:53 this is what I see under my bed at 3 AM.
🗑 🗑 🗑
I'm getting The Fifth Element vibes
Literally the worst song ever made, why tf did YT recommend this.
Can anyone explain to me why this song is so addicting? Is it the beat? Is it the Tyrone Biggums crack she sprinkled on it? Is it her voice and lyrics? Idk I don't get it
This song is garbage
Did you come up with this song while playing fortnite?
Music vid just get weirder and weirder
This is my favorite song from her
CALL HIM ED SHEERAN HE IN LOVE WITH MY BODY
I don't know if she's trying to sound sexy or.. she sounds awful. Not sexy at all
We in South Padre Island bby
Dojaaaa
videos are too meta. wow.
I love this SONGGGG!!!!! DOJA CAT YOUR THE BESTTT😍😍😍
La chilindrina cantando!!
The song is absolutely amazing! But I'm just over here gazing at all the beutiful makeup and costumes, Doja looks stunning!
❤️❤️❤️❤️
how do i pronounce the name
me not being able to process this correctly
Guys don’t mind the background dancers..they are doing their own lil dance and giving.
Dmnit she just keeps pumpin out hits. Get it girl!
Taco Bell commercial brought me here
As a trekkie I just became 50 million times more of a Doja fan
This song is garbage
i love this song
why would the captions for the aliens also be in their foreign language? other than that, loveee<333 purr even
First song I have ever knowingly listened to by Doja Cat and I like it
some fucking gobbledeegook baby talk over a beat lol nope
Si j'aurais été Nicki j'aurais adoré cet hommage
My girl loves her videos yes ma'am
I lov u
Not really a fan of this sort of music............ usually! ,, but i found my self listening to it over and over again and i love it  ,,, ok then i will  go with it
Шедевр✨🤟🏻

Songs pretty catchy
One if those catchy tunes that I don't no a fucking word to, but when it comes on I know it's time to do a lil bounce.
When she said where is starscream  And bruh showed the Cat I died 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Big in Space ! ~(^.~.^)~
am i the only one who burst out laughing hysterically at  1:43 and 1:48 AND 1:52 🥴🤪🤣?
Trash lyrics.
I like her hair and fit
1:18
Evan i, as a man, wanna twerk on it
Ayo the bois are twerking 😭
Why did she say "Thank you Nicki" at 1:57? Is that meant in a sarcastic way or...?
horrible
Delicious 🤤
I dont understand the video lol
I see tlc-no scrubs in this video, was prabably her inspo
Let you vibe with space vibes
My name lia and i love it!!
Might be the worst song I’ve respectfully heard 🥶
I love how much this music video screams Space Channel 5
Every time I hear this lady sing all I hear is Nicki Minaj style coming out of her, the  voice sounds exactly like Nicki Minaj and if you don’t think so you’re just full of shit Doja Cat is a cookie cutter copy, I tried to give her a space but I just can’t
Well, this just shows the main song of the day
Are we not gonna talk about how the men behind dojo is totally gay 👇              Edit:like if you agree
Cal him ed sheeran he left in my body.😂
hell yeah shits hard behind speakers
Absolutely Ludacris......  I love It.
Music producer (since she doesn’t seem to have it, the loon sound in the beginning) Y2K Ari David Starace. Apologies if she does have it but I’ve looked like 5 times 🤣
This is giving very much TLC no scrubs
i love u DOJA CAT!!!
Doja Cat you're the best ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
❤
She said ariana
Gosh Doja Cat is an angel very beautiful gorgeous princess queen sweetness angel.
Doja killed it 💕🔥🔥🔥🔥
1:04
Way to copy TLC 😆
What if a child find this music 100 years from now and asking his dad what is this jshsishksj
THE ALCOHOL BOTTLE AT 2:09 SAYS BELUGA-
Wow load of load.. its out finally...
The cat is the lowkey the *secret main character*
This video is everything😂
This is one of those songs, I wish i did not like it, but i do. I love it! Yes, i want to pop up on these clowns like i'm the BATMAN! And who is the beauty with the purple eyes at 0:29 i am in love with her too.

This song grew on me, but the video is overwhelming!!!
This is why music today is dieing
El michiiii aaaawww <3
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Ugh. This song shows how far music in 2022 has gone down the tubes lol. This seems like scanning a Gen Zs head the nightmare within it and a Lifewater commercial. Think I will see how country music is doing these days 😆
Dam girl , You are the fookin coolest ass artist I ever saw round here, The hottest spicy Mc babersen ... that's probably yer real name 😉
This my favorite song by Doja ❤
Damn, Lizzo lost weight, lookin fine gurl.

Ela tem a voz linda!!!!!!   Amo ela,!!!!
mid song + mid creator +overated
Me wondering when they say get in to yuh they make it so loud when they actually  edited  it

*Dear person who may be reading this* . . 👇 *You’re amazing stay blessed, stay safe and have a amazing rest of your day* ❤
Why is she so weird..
Me when I saw dojas face when she found out where starscream was: - dis bitch scary bad queen
this is what i imagine space travel in the future would be
Just thinking 🤔 we are dead if we do get attacked from aliens 😂😂🙏
I Love how they’re in space to save a cat 🥹💞
❤2:00❤
💟
The soldiers twerking on the aliens sends me lmaoooooo
It's 2 am in Texas I luv u Doja u blew up much love outta Tx
She is the queen of Earth, no the entire UNIVERSE.
What is it about her that reminds me of Left Eye (RIP) from TLC?
Why bother to annunciation when your target audience didn't even attend school...articulate vocabulary ...for what?! When what you have to say is useless it might as well be verbal toilet paper
My how profound...lol total joke stupid music for a bunch of stupid fux lol
This freaking hilarious
The only videos I look forward to watch are Doja Cat’s.
Love this song❤️🧡💛
This is looking a lot like the Orville 🤨
I’m not gonna be a simp
I bet her parents are proud of her.I am.She is so unique
,
I've been waiting for the sun since a long time
AHHH her charisma is so infectious, Doja is the definition of a STAR
Good ❤️😎
Eu queria que esse clipe fosse um filme, sério... ela precisa fazer um filme com esse mesmo tema de espaço sideral.... nem que seja só pra resgatar um gato. ficou perfeito.
The thing that makes doga so important is she is telling her family to come home  .!!! our mom has been stolen by lizard peopl;e...she is fighting alone...doga is new money. it talks... soccer ball ??  the seller must be posh spice
lyrics
Which Nikki she thanked in the last?

One ☝️ thing hit me about doja cat , why is she getting so skinny is that her new look ? Or does she have a disorder when she first broke out she was thick af idk 🤷‍♀️ or is she on drugs didn’t want to say that part but just guessing

I honestly thought Nicki was in this from the radio. Mind blown.
that one no booty girl is distracting me, no bueno
não me canso nunca 😍😱
This prank of one of the criminal band who are wearing spy equipment in heads to hack other people who they humiliate for money by making holes in their heads. They are very bad and evel. They act illigally that is why some of them already have broken bones and they are suffering in pain. These criminals with spy equipment in their body use without any my permission copy of my young body and head of and digital copy of my voice for feeding their criminal band. They stole digital robot copy of Diana Spencer body and voice and made a lot of  fake singers of it. They fill themself insured by stealing copy of my voice and body that they did to represend digital body of Diana Spencer. They are completely criminals, half of them are disabled on today but they steal blackmale uk kingdom by making  their dirty money and humiliating me online for feading their criminal band. .   .  ,,

I hate this song, really over rated. 🙄
Doja Cat:*sings it so catchy and smoothe* Me:*sings it but end up sound like a dying frog try to summon a demon at 3am*
It's honestly ki da funny how she just deflects the bullets of her pelvic area but humps like at the same time. Lol honestly funny.
Only watch for the kitty *jokes I love u queen*
Singers who write 🔞 lyrics like Dua Lipa set a bad example for young girls. There should be a 🔞 icon before the song starts.

Real 5th element movie vibes 🙌🏼
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🎶👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
I like her good girl accent. She's no innocent girl. Every good girl's got a business. ❤️❤️❤️👍
Did I hear her say "Thank you Nikki" ?
I don't care what her political views or whatever is - I FREAKING LOVE how good Doja sounds.  She sings and raps like a MONSTER.  So much swag and her tracks just bumps!!!  DOJA. IS. MY. SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT!
🙌🙌🙌
I always wonder what language she invented here
Dona da porra toda 😻
Videos a little out of pocket as expected.
I was on an exam and my brain kept on playing 0:22 to 0:30 on my head😭😭😭
Another Day Another Slay🗿💃
I love u
this song is so addicting
get into idiot ? One hit beaten Ru'afo 2:02 , strong woman !
يووووووووو اخزيين جحركن ساع طبون الغاز

Bad bitch  rawrrr vibes plus nicki mad rapping
My bf likes this song lol. Run up his likes https://youtu.be/aPCZ8yYxr5k
did i see lele pons.
Okay this is sooo good
I don’t listen to doja often but my cousin told me how he worked with her in this music video I didn’t believe him so I gave it a watch and sure as shit he’s in it 😂 Ty I’m proud of you brother!
I'd do the same for my cats 🐈 😤😆
❤❤❤
I bet Doja likes Anime♡
If you want a pet you HAVE to be able to do these things to save it . 💖
nicki manaj flow jack
the Rihanna of our time 🙌
O que esse clip nos ensina: Nunca roube o gato da Doja cat.
This is really fireeeee🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🥵🥵
A bit of 5th element reference at the end?
1:53 the laser didn’t touch the armor ....
This one of my favorite songs of yours ♥
I love this song and video, but at 0:07 that animal call is a Common Loon and it just makes me giggle uncontrollably.
TLC - No scrubs kinda vibe 😂
🤣
can we talk about her creativity and the actual wholesomeness of this video being about her rescuing her cat? Doja is incredible
Adorei o filme 😍
Wait I might be dumb but she says “Thank you Nicki” is she thanking Nicki Minaj?
.
The katy perry and lady gaga of rap
The second y'all haters clicked this video to leave a comment, your points for why you don't like doja cat became invalid. If it was a compilation or appreciation vid that got recommended to you or that you searched up because you were trying to understand why people like her, I'd give you the benefit of the doubt. But the only reason why you'd be on here is to hear her song or just shit talk which is why I'll assume you just a troll. No one came here to debate doja cat, we just want to appreciate her greatness
Doja cat saving Doja’s cat!
Love that the cat is named starscream 😻
The bullets bouncing off her armor lmao I love iy
She was giving Nicki Minaj a break with her previous releases..
Watching the new Doja cat song parents walk and question what I’m watching
She’s pretty and 🔥 I like her
I can't stop listening to this great music. You have a lot of talent, Doja
The song is great but video isn't
STUPID DUMBASS SONG
She has cool clothes,cool makeup and videos
TLC  No Scrubs
She is LITERALLY AMAZING
did anyone else notice this is TLC inspired 😭She do be doing the no scrubs style dance
I really remember hearing this song off of the commercial lmaooooo, I love it. Doja is a Queeeennnnn fr
I just watched this music video this is outstanding. I don't understand why it didn't have much views.
😍😍😍😘😘😘😚😚❤❤❤❤💋💋💋💋😳😏😏😏
John wick 2.0 “I watched her kill 2 men by twerking”

Why does this track sound like she ripped off ppcocaine's voice?
y Love You Doja Cat
*_gay panic_*
I love how she went through all that fighting for Starscream
Love ❤️
I'm curious. How do you interpret the song / video? I have one... just wanna see if others are getting the same. 😅
:3 hermoso  ------------------------ te amo <3
Doja's blazing her path.   I also like how she seems to pay recognition by name dropping Nikki -as in Nikki Minaj whose rap style may have influenced Doja on this track. Nice.
Starcream is so cute tho
--Can we get a movie like this??? Please?
The twerking made me laugh soo hard... That I fell off of my bed.
Did she say ariana?? 1:23
This music vid was beyond everything I hoped for and more 🚀❤️‍🔥
0:58 you're welcome
Is this the song from doja cat when she says hello
Garbage generation
What's on your stack?
Taco Bell commercial
OMG I LOVE THISS
Singing like this before reading lyrics….Getting into a yacht… 🤦🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️
Her voice in the pre-chorus reminds me of Spongebob's squeaky boots.
This songs sooo fire 🔥 thank you Doja Doll!!
been back like 74 times... still feeling dat vibe
IF YOU HAD HARD TIME FINDING THIS SONG THEN YOU RELATE TO THIS COMMENT 🤔😆
Paraguay
the only bad thing about this song is that it   ends...bravo Doja!
https://youtube.com/c/Th3Brid3OfJ3sus333
Espera, ¿realmente fue al espacio y salvó a su gato?
what are they shooting?
She went hard on this 1
Big buff men twerking is something I never knew I needed and now know I cannot live without. Thank you Doja💖
Wtf did i just watch 😂😂
Yuh
this video is amazing but can we take a moment to realize that this is about Doja getting her cat back?
Garbage Music..Sad.
I can't understand the comparison with Nicki, she's more than just a rapper..
What happen to the other video with this song
Was that Y2k?
SLAYYYYYY
Don't watch youcnt
Superwoman's super dancers super rapper super choreographer superfemale supergirl superlady Ed Sheeran's in Love with her Body 🎶 🎵 making men twerk lol 😆😜😍
So much lyrics., but soo little said. Sad times for music industry.
Doja I stripping on you, wanting to ask people that appreciate art... Did you see that? Or Dang girl or even, hhheeeeeeyyyyy, you go girl. ❤Be nice.
Silencio pusieron
lol
😂😂
🔥🔥🔥
Her slapping the alien is my favorite part
bruh doja is shorter then her orange men
I feel like I have watched this 1,000 times, and I still can't help myself from laughing at 1:40
No scrubs by TLC vibes
I love the dancers! Both the men twerking in combat and the bridge girls bopping had me ENTERTAINED!!!
Love this song
Need more women with their asses hanging out.
TLC Vibes
When she says big rocket launcher...i think she means penis
Looking lile the cutest lightest skinned i ever seen
Funny silly video though
I don't understand anything she's saying in the course except for the title and the word butt
The shameless product placement 😂
When she say it, thank you nicki I love you, that was insane
This is cancer
Noooooo STARSCREAM!!😭😭😭😤🔪
Is "Starstream" the little kitty . . . *?* 😺 Omg. Soo cute tht she went to great lengths jst to rescue the fur beebee. xp ♡
Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww kitty
Did anyone here noticed that y2k is at 0:45????? Jajjajajajaja
This is the like that of planet her
Creo que sí esto hubiera existido cuando era niña, mi vida hubiese sido distinta. Gracias Doja por ir a rescatar a Starscream 😍
I hear “get it Toya”
I love doja
Fun fact : Nicki wrote this track !
Can we break off a piece for the dancers?
Why did I just get a dojo cat ad um that’s creepy
My cousin like u
She so versatile ❤️❤️❤️
Lol I love her!!
✨✨✨
hear me out
i love the music the end was sus
Worst song I've ever heard 🤣 WTF
When are you finally gonna quit music??
💯✅, ❤️it
Your clip is sooooo good !
She don’t need no collaboration  she can do all verse Rap sing dance ………etc
Tourette inducing song. 😛
she looks like that space girl in fortnite lmao
What is this about?
another straight fuckin banger.
ok but fr that cat cute af
This video is so dope!!
i can tell the background actors at the end are from industry baby
Like a music box as a kiddo, i just wanna rewind and play this sweet tune repeatedly. Doja voice is so unique, sharp, vibrant, child-like yet aged like wine, music box business i love this
Can we just take anmomment to say that doja cat would go anywhere just to get a cat like bruh
Kinda cheesy but I like it 👌
🙏🙏
🙏🙏
top
Jimin's hair
So this is how I protect my cat 😁🥰
I'd the same doja not my baby😾, give em the pow, pow
legenda pequena ne
2000's vibe and Cat in one?! Go doja!!
This reminds me of a Katy Perry video
i dont know but this song reminds me of Nicki Minaj - Massive Attack ft. Sean Garrett
I'm not a fan of rap or anything but I just gotta say that doja is one talented and creative woman, she has great creative ideas for music videos
What did I just see or hear? 😳😳
Love your tracks & ery'thang else  in between...git it girl!!
I only liked this video cause of the impressive talent and design of the work of the makeup artist on the three alien actors. I'm genuinely surprised and disappointed to know that I might never see these alien designs or the work of these make up artists being put into a real sci fi movie or series.
No one realizes everything she does is over sexualizing women.
woo! <3
Did nobody get the massive attack reference and that’s why she said thank u nicki
go ahead and run that by me one more time
Hold on I think I'm going crazy I heard this song before on tiktok in 2021 or I'm I just being stupid and she just released the official version???? . _ .
Now we need a crossover with "The Orville."
I honestly don’t blame her, I would do the same ti get my cat back xDDD
Starscream?? Is this an Olan Rogers reference...
Love Sadistik, Blink, Parkway, Astronautalis, P.O.D and sage Francis but Doja is my guilty pleasure. She's just amazing.
I think music is been copied from the song "dil dooba"
This video is straight fire 🙏🙏 and Love sci bruh 🔥🔥
0:58 can we just talk abt this moment🥺
😈😈😈
no cap the ame on her ass is whack

0:58 The look on Doja’s face, and the camera zooming in on her face is hilarious to me. I’m surprised it’s not a meme yet!

Doja got some real defense lines.💔😌🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👑
Did she thank Nicki at the end for being her inspiration or because she helped her on this song?
Masterpiece !😄

Doja cat: Thank you nicki, i love you! *Smacks him in the face*

Does doja cat not realize how many songs/ trends she holds on tiktok because of her amazing songs?!
people think doja is amazing but they don't know how iconic 2010s queens.
1:27 did she just say ca ca

Stupidest lyrics I ever heard
Now I see why it's sensored to doja's face.. all this tym I was cursing out my country agency for senssoring blurring out.. but no it's too fire to be on tv❤️❤️❤️
I don't usually listen to pop, not since I was a kid, but this is catchy as fuck.

This woman is literally carrying this industry on her back. Doja I hope you're getting rest and taking care of yourself:)
2:21 cat eye
T.L.C vibes!!! No scrub!!!!
I knew I’d seen Y2K. The intro usually heard on bbn$ tracks was a dead giveaway. I already loved DojaC but this just made me 😱!  Love the collab!!!
I will forever and always be a Doja fan. Been listening since her SoundCloud days and I swear her music empowers me, relaxes me, and hypes me up all at the same time. Thank you Doja Cat for consistently churning out music that makes me feel good. 💕
What a good cat mom
you like cats?
Genuinely thought this was being sung in Japanese or Korean until 35 seconds in...
I love how it was all for the cat at the end <3

How the funking good flow
now. who dosent love cats they are  amazing!
Qqw
Make something for kids please
I always wondered, what made me special; my friends missed me, my ex's all said I have a special place in their heart, and then one day my sister told me, "our great grandma wagster was a very special person" I said "Whatcha mean?" to which she replied "She just had a very special, loving, giving, aura, and all her friends and family adored her." to this, I said, "HAYLEY THAT'S IT! The special love that great grandma gave our grandma, the love that grandma then gave to our mom, THAT'S WHAT MAKES US SPECIAL!!" And prior to this like Thomas Edison "I have not failed I've found 1,000 ways that don't work" I tried day in and day out multiple things to help my anxiety and depression. and nothing worked. UNTIL HAYLEY ACCIDENTLY TOLD ME THE ANSWER, HOW HILARIOUS IS THAT. But I say this because you don't have to use my lifehack of remembering you are loved to heal yourself, but I WORKED HARD ON IT, SO IT'D BE COOL IF YA DID:) (AND IF U WANNA CHANGE THE WORDING IN THIS STORY SO IT FITS YOURSELF SO U CAN PASS ON HEALING INFORMATION TO PEOPLE WHO CAN PASS ON HEALING INFORMATION TO PEOPLE AND CAUSE THAT RIPPLE EFFECT OF LOVE, THEN I DON'T GIVE HALF A FUCK)
Does she breath?!
What did she put in this song😭♥️✨
We’ll that is irritating, dare I say, music. 🤮

Missy meets the 5th element.... then last words by Nicki. cool no beef
I want to thank Doja for making Get into It (Yuh) because if I listen to it, I felt like a 100% bitch.
producers: how many gay guys doja cat :yes :)
Do mess with Doja cat cats she will get mad😂😊

Girl which put a lot of fluid on her face
Doja just proved she can look good with long hair short hair and even shorter hair LIKE MISS GURL IS SOOO BEAUTIFUL!!!❤
I love the TLC homage on the Ed Sheran line.  she's a genius and u will miss her references if u blink.   ED sampled TLC  and Doja shouted out Ed while doing tboz no scrubs dance
doja rapping: 🤬😈😼🔫⛓💣⚔️🖕🏿  doja talking: 🌸✨💞☁️🥰💖😊
Satan laughing, spreads his wings looking upon the younger generation that is kiling the future generation. Pop, Rap is killing the future. No one wants ROCk/METAL any more those are forbidden. now everyone wants to shake some a**. I strike for ROCK✊🏼️ back when those days were good. Rock brings energy not bad words bad videos bad thoughts just ENERGY⚡️lets strike for ROCK 🏴✊🏼️
Totally felt my IQ points dropping. Thanks Doja.

This woman is so loveable
How do these visuals match at all ? .. oh wait it's impossible because this song is actually nothing about about nothing.    Because music is pointless now
Her pink hair gave me no scrubs vibes.
Best ad for water I've ever seen
Getting tired of songs that are under 3 minutes long...........real tired
Trash

Anyone else notice Y2K?
I LOVE YOU DOJA🤩🔥
Finaly she did a video clip👏🏻👏🏻
The video is a work of art. Misogynists beware. She destroys them all and takes her "cat" back. i love this vid.

Ist irgendwen aufgefallen, dass am Anfang auf dem Display einfach y2k ist LOL
“Call your mama and your papa like I’m finna take your daughter” PLS DOJA TAKE MEEEEEE

Olan rogers cats name was also starscream  I'm thinking she's an olan rogers fan
If I were Ed Sheeran I would slide into those DMs like a m*fer. Like dude, she just said that she's into you in a song! What are you doing?! 😂
Shes a weird singer . that's what I like about her . good videos keep them coming…
Oh my Gahd, Doja's cat has the same name as Olan Roger's cat. Is it a coincidence, or is it the same cat?
I love you so much
Super fan 💗💗
Beatiful darling 💋💋💋
I L O V E Y OU DOJAAA 💗💗💗💗
I love how the Aliens look so uncomfortable while they were tweaking 😂
Life Water has now became Fiji
The way I laughed so hard at this  🤣 I love it doja cat, amazing
This is my favorite song
Is it just me, or doesn’t that room ( her with red hair in it ) look like it’s a reference to TLC?
🌏🌏🌏🌏🌏🌏🌏🌏🌏
Be honest, if Doja Cat wanted to kill you, people would be too confused to stop her.
Hadada badada
got that big rocket launcher
Tu Doja non fai rimpiangere di certo l'old school hip hop ! Complimenti ed onore alle nuove giovani generazioni ! Che hanno a loro vantaggio però i social ! Inesistenti quando ero io giovane 😭😭😭 Nadege 80
Reminds me of a TLC video
Love song👍👍🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🖤🖤🖤🖤💯👍👍
Watch this in x1.25 speed. You won’t be disappointed. 🫣
U and Niki need to do a colabo already.

I got the Space Channel 5 reference the first time, idk about y’all
Doji rocking the k-pop haircut
Has to be the weirdest and most hilarious video ever in her career wtf 😂
the girls should be all like doing lesbian stuff. i am a nice classy man and i am NOT a pervert.
Cool song waiting for the english version
I can't even understand the words 😂😂
This is cringe-

In all these comments I’ve learned one thing: she’s a cat
Yup certified baddie
Storm survivor rose 🌹 quick.

Intergalactic law enforcement in 4022 be like
Love you dojaaaaaaaaaaa ❤️
39M
Cute cat
This girl has real humor
Carti
Nice cameo, Y2K.
She is channeling TLC's T-Boz in their No Scrubs Video in the red hair scenes.
Very catchy song, I hope it goes very far & lasts long in the charts. I can't wait for her album to be released. I have a good feeling that 2022 will be huge.
Doja  looks good in everything
جميله حدا لاغنيه😍😍🇮🇶🇮🇶🇮🇶
БЕЛУГА??? ЧТО???
She travels quite a lot…      To space and 🌌
Your music is lame all it talks is about sexual stuff I guess that’s the sacrifices ppl do for fame
YOUR VOICE IS AMAZING & UNIQUE🫠
this is some weird stuff
😘😘😘
there is something in this sound that we all need to hear Its there and we cant stop
All of your song is viral ✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨
Really not my kinda music. But I find this women hypnotising
Bayılıyorum bu kadına kraliçe 👑

TONY CORLEONE
ALEX HAS BEEN SAVED BY TURTLE MAN
Her looks in this video remind. Of.the mermaid scales person
The LORE!

The video is so stupid lol
This the best music video i've seen in my life
tlc dancing and laughing with happiness....stilll for me ,to much "white azzes".....with internationinal  video would be greater and better.....no hate "iove every butt and woaman in this world"
Worst song ever made. Came here specifically to say this.
the greateast popstar in the world right now for sureeee
My 1 yr old is absolutely obsessed with this song 😂
This is why girls don’t allow there boyfriends to watch Dojo Cat 😂
Bro imagine having advanced laser weapon only to be beaten by twerking men and a woman
Starscream is such a baller name for a cat
love you so much bitch
this is just terrible one of the worst piles of dog shit ever
I LOVE DOJA CAT
Are u okay?
I thought this was nicki……js…..people get inspired from others….no hate….
Tony Corleone sends his regards
lol when she shoots them back with her dance moves
Lindaaa! 😍🇧🇷
INDUSTRY PLANT. CARBON COPY OF NICKI MINAJ/ COI LERAY FLOW. AND SHE ALSO CARBON COPIED RIHANNA FOR LET ME BE YOUR WOMAN. YOU “FANS” ARE DISGUSTING AND PATHETIC, AND SOLE BRINGERS OF ART/MUSIC DECLINE.
Is me or does this remind me of  tlc I don’t want your love
STARTED thisented to this tune there, whilst I lost my cat, cunt better come back
I'm still getting better Nicki vibes.
I love this song, I love this music video, and I love Doja Cat
Y'all act like she made the song and video 🙄 There are ppl getting paid higher bucks that do the real work...duh
I'm ready for the alien invasion now!
Beluga, Life Water and Tile product endorsements in this video.   Imagine being so poor that your music video is just an infomercial.
I like xx
ms doja pls tell me if kubzscouts is in this with you 😭
This is creepy. Now a day they need to show ass to sell
i love your songs so much
What a strange tune
Tony Corleone is why I'm here.
What the fuck did I just watch
doja arraza
Fight with twerks, yassss queen
Chumbava tranquilamente
Doja, you're queen!
I feel zero regrets stanning this fine lady ❤️
🇩🇿🇩🇿🇩🇿🥺🥺
Best video after long time
doja cat is a life saver fr
The cat in the video is now officially popular 👍
These outfits are very unflattering. Really awful.

She name her cat after stars scream the decepticon

What can I say but Doja Cat just keeps on pumpin out awesome art both musically and visually!!
this is the best music video ever made
I love all your songs❤❤❤❤
Does not get old..⚡️
I  love you Doja Cat 😍
Lol 🤣 WTF
2:21 cute
2:10 how much did they pay her to promote Russian branded vodka Beluga?!
2:07 good job!
I started binge watching Doja’s mvs since yesterday  Her songs had been added in my playlist and I had listened to them  But after listening more and watching MVs I became addictive
1:44 looool ahahhaha
She’s giving me Tboz TLC vibes with this
"thank you niki, i love youu " is so iconic omg
After listening this song I am in mental hospital.
1:58 was just. AND HER LAUGH AT THE END. oml im obssessed. “thank you nikki, i love you” WOW. JUST WOW.
I have been hearing this on the radio in the car for a few days, didn't know who it was, should have known it was Doja lol.  I like everything she does.  Love this one.
Doja 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Why do I feel like this is related to she-ra in some form?
If aliens ever invade earth, we will twerk to save our planet.
*Marvel taking notes on the portal thing* 🤣
every time i watch a doja video, she makes me want to draw. i hope other artists find a muse like that.
Tony Corleone did the best cover
The beat is great, the rest of the song SUCKS!💯👎
Nicki 2.0
Did you realise when the girl poured her wine,it labelled “Beluga” 🧐
NO MATTER IF YOU DID SOMETHING  WRONG:)
I  LOVE YOU DOJA AND I WILL ALWAYS FORGIVE YOU
Why does her voice sound like that
My ears are bleeding actually
Y’all lucky YouTube don’t show dislikes😂 30 millions views only 1 million likes there’s at least 2 million dislikes
Love mua some Doja
Doja cat i love you so much so so much
For one thing Ge VW You came to Texas Texas Did not come to you Get that straight right know!!
Anybody getting Space Channel 5 vibes?
Y2K is it you?
Omg I love it and you are the best thing ever girl I love you😍😘😍😘😍😘😘😍😍😘😍😘😘😍😘😍
NOLA- TO -DOJA.  SHOUT OUT! We love u in the TRUE SOUTH ❤️
Crazy to see the influence, X left on the rest of these artists. Basically set a blueprint for these mainstream songs like this.
See you can just Read the Phone Book as a song and still make a million views.  Just remember Almost Full Nude Girls in the BackGround for the Music Video...
this mv scream like 'DOJA IS ENFP'
how does she sound like playboi cardi just like him, usually people sound dumb but she did it
Dojas pen is unmatched and very unique to her lol I love her
2:10 did anyone else realise that the bottle said "beluga" on it 😂
its giving ZENON!!!!!!!
This is my favorite music video now best ending ever
Lol the second she mentioned the "Big Rocket Launcher" I immediately got the context from Nicki"s - Massive Attack from 12 years ago!
Am a kid and this girl trash and am a actually kid
I love Doja, hate this song and yet I can't stop listening to it.
2:10 The drink that person was giving Doja looks like water in an alcohol bottle.
0:59 I’m suprised she didn’t look shocked and yell, “Let go of my cat right now!” like a superhero would with the bad guys.
0:50 Is he speaking Japanese or some other language with a different alphabet from English?
Bestiiiiii
Lenda representa mais o Brasil q samba e futebol
1:40 this was my fav part 😂
I love your song you are my favorite in my book 1800s owner NFL
Sister think she carti
She said “Thank you Nicki”.. for whom? Nicki Minaj?
0:10
she so pretty :)
What language is this in...?
I love the TLC vibes.
I can’t stop hearing the Taco Bell commercial
I gotta be honest, this is one of the hardest to cover
O vídeo tem uma vibe meio TLC 👊
I can see the TLC No Scrubs influence on this video
Love the song, but what did I just watch?
She made a whole movie
The fact she can rap,sing,dance is what made me fall deeply in love with her tbh❤️❤️☺️
She the female thugger 🐐
Tlc
This song never fails plays at the right time yuh 💋
Meow.  🐾
We love Doja❤🥰 From Philippines 🇵🇭
musica que no corresponde al video masonico! simbologia iluminatii y reptiliana  mkultra??
WTF????
This song turns Monday into a fun day
The Song is taht doja go to the space to geht her cat ?
Doja te amo
What is this  satanic shit?
Hell yeah girl go get yo cat back
This song and “Did You Call Me” by Lukaz are some of the only things getting me through tough times. I hope everyone is doing well. I love you 🌹
I’m a 40 year old housewife in East Tennessee and I absolutely 💕LOVE Doja Cat 🐈! My teenagers say I’m “too old” to listen but I don’t give AF!
Seriously this is one of her best videos and songs......the ending where she said Thank You Nicki, I love you!!!!!
That was too cute and creative . Ugh doja 🙌🏽
this is drag.
Lol purring meow day couch day lol
Oh wow she’s done an amazing job with her body soo pretty and sexy great song
Pussy PowEr 👊👽
Hate most ur music, but this shit hits!
All for the cat 😍
I’m not gone lie, I first was confused of her music. Sometimes didn’t know what she was saying but heard some words. It’s her unique voice I know. But it took for my daughter to sing this song almost in the same voice Doja raps in, for me to finally listen like wait what is this, what is she saying. To say the less now I LOVVVVVVE this song and her! I hear you sis, talk yo shit lol 🤣💯
Dear lord….she is sooooo absolutely freaking annoying!!!! This new rap crap is just that, a bunch of crap!!!!! Around 2006-2007is I wanna say is the time I quit listening to rap. It’s absolutely freaking horrible!!!!!!!
The best diversion is adult males twerking all over the enemy... Noted
Lol. I thought at one point, she said ed Sheeran 😭👋
Lol all about a cat but honestly I would to
Mission get my motha fuckin get my cat back
1:36 tho😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😂😂🤣🤣🤣😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
so the men are fully clothed but the women are wearing thongs. nice move Doja, sexualizing female bodies but preserving the intimacy of male ones fake feminist
GET INTO IT!
Good 👍👍👍👍🥰🥰😘😘👍👍💪💪
I wonder how much sex goes on in that ship
What a good hommage to nicki " Got a Big rocket launcher "
my fav singer is good at dancing if you don't like her dance skills, just get into it, yuh
Vs Beyonce c.
why is no-one here talking about the fact that she going to save a cat 🗿
This one is a masterclass. Ravishing makeup, elaborate outfits, fun concept for the video and superb acting from Doja. I can't say the same for Juicy though - that one is just a full-on porno.
I hope Tick-tock doesn’t ruin this one
Imagine if Nicki was actually in the video
It's giving leeloo from fifth element and I stan!
Not me telling my cat I'd do the same for her too 😂
Awful...
YESS QUEEN GET IT 😮‍💨
You people don't know REAL music.
Reminds me of the girl making videos in the Movie the last Dragon. I love Doja!
Hey Doja I love you

There were at least 3 sponsors in this video
🥵❣️🔥🔥🔥🔥
Every song makes this woman a queen
Can't understand shit, the beat is decent but nothing amazing. New generation I know you love this shit, keep it.
The fact that she deflects the last laser without the armor truly shows how thicc DojaCat is
TLC NO SCRUB VIBE!
i love their songs even though they are a bit rude i don't know but all doja cat's songs are amazing
These women rappers are so sexually vulgar these days they make Lil Kim look like Dora the Explorer!!
Jesus Christ, if this is what's considered music now I've lost all hope in humanity...
SO GOOD #IM 11 SO COOL ! from a girl not boy
The fith element
She copy TLC " no scrub" MV. Shame on her.

Don’t see how the video has anything to do with the lyrics. Very missy elliot of her lol
She's addicting goddd🔥
Are you even listening to this at all? How can you without wanting to poke screwdrivers into your ears? The sounds, they are total crap.

Doja would be a perfect Barbarella 😍 Also, why isn't this 100x longer??

My Girl Said “Call Up Ed Sheeran, He In Love With My Body !” I Can’t Get This Damn Part Nor Song Out My Head. ❣️😂🤣‼️💯
I wish she gain her weight back
1 Corinthians 15 15 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;  2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.  3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;
This is so cringy.
This album is a Master Piece One of the great albums of all time !! You Go Doja Cat !!
Doja Cat is the female Austin Powers.  Women want to be here, men want to be with her, and she kills cyborgs with her mojo.
Caramba ela com a roupa laranja parece personagem de anime e o melhor é que ficou mó legal
Pretty sure Kendrick Or Nicki Minaj Wrote This 🫠
THIS GAVE ME TLC vibe. 😛

2:02 If I was that creature who had Doja Cat’s cat, then after Doja Cat slapped me, I would’ve said to her, “You should’ve asked politely for your cat back.”.

I’m sorry but those outfits at the beginning are floss and not clothes

The whole video just said:don’t mess with doja
I have a cat and I approve interplanetary warfare in the name of cats. Rale knows ❤️
Doja looks like a character from horizon forbidden west
She has a very sexy voice it just reached out to you
why
I hear thugga, Wayne, missy, Nicky which one is she 😌😌
0:46 ayeeee looka my boy Y2K
shes really really smart with her corporate software logo design, do you all realize shes like showing off all of these business design concepts? a blockchain hexagon chainlink hive TILE pink cryptogirlgang logo? come on thats genius.  I trained her well
can we just appreciate the fact that the dancers managed to get a take where none of them just burst out laughing 💀
This is so bad. Words can't describe how bad this music is. As far as I'm concerned this shouldn't even be considered music. It is TRASH. And so is basically all hip hop  and rap music . Again total trash. 0/10 would recommend. But the truth is I wouldn't even recommend it.
DOJA PLAY APEX WITH ME PLS
0:10
Can they make this a whole movie 😂
Transformers reference tho 🤔
Doja have a alien fetish and fantasy or something lol 😂 😂😂😂
Tiktok
Yuss get into it yuhhh
She sooo stewpsss I love her 😂😂😂 #westcoast

wow this is shit this crap and republicans will destroy the world
Don't take my cat😹
I'm pretty sure this song is about me guys
I love that the lasers and ricochet sounds are on beat.
1:24 The tile 😅🤭
0:31 - what a disgusting scene - looks really bad
This song and “Did You Call Me” by Lukaz are some of the only things getting me through tough times ❤️ I hope everyone is doing well. I love you 🌹
This song sucks,she's annoying, and after hearing this 🗑, yes I had to see what she looked like, I hope her career plummets like every other 🗑 rapper of this generation
The video feels like a parody of Star Trek
💜
THIS IS CURSED
I won’t y’all women suck so damn much at hip hop today it’s almost unreal. It’s literally just carbon copy after carbon copy of this little girl voice with as much purposeful annoyance as possible stitches in to each note and word.   I know they aren’t the first. But I blame Drake for popularizing this sort of stupid talk rapping, where your purposely trying to seem lackadaisical and mumbling half the words. And of course Nicki trying to sound as much like a baby as possible while twerking her hurt cheeks wide and open for entry. It’s a really disgusting Meta they have going on. Play like a little girl attitude and voice/attire as much as you can. While rapping about Ashanti vividly hardcore sexual acts as possible, while doing it.  Hmmm. Who are the real weirdos? Is it men, that get the reputation so often. Or women today sexualization themselves in their teens and doin this baby st. Why by the way f sucks.
the ending was funny and it's amazing!
Skanky AF😂😅
can we just all talk about how BeAuTiFuL the cat is
The second where she dodges the bullet off her butt, so badass and hilarious 🔥
Bilat power
Them guys shaking hams
This shit so weird and that's ok
This song is so catchy for literally no reason😂
Probably wouldn't here this song if it wasn't for tiktok
parabéns vc se garantiu nesta
Got that big rocket launcher! 😏😏😏
I loved it!
chocolate milk, more milk than chocolate.
Horrible

The song came through southside+
Wow Doha has taught us something that if you are ever getting held by a gun just tweak and dance and your problems will be solved    Don’t take the seriously doja just being funny ❤
these TLC references are GIVING!!!
Gorgeous, can sing, rap, dance-has an amazing body. God gave her all the talents!
@1:40 Instead of "Attack on Titan it was like Attack of Twerking"💀
I love this video so much 😩❤️

Her Outfits are ICONIC!
Ayooo cat lovers we stan

Those ladies' crew uniforms look a little bit uncomfortable :o

This song fucking beats! Better than rap god
The forbidden star wars
The bar for entertainment keeps falling lower and lower.
Damn I thought this was cori laray
💎
Lol I just love her
Respect. U got it
I don't think many people notice this but her descriptions have credit to every single person that worked on a project, apart from getting her own she has given a platform to every single person that has helped her which is incredibly humble and down to earth of her.
She's dope
It didn't say everything
I love when the boys were twerking
WHY IS IT OK 4 HER TO CLAIM BLACK WHEN SHE THINKS ITS CONVENIENT??SHE HAS SELF HATE ON HER BLK SIDE N WAS CAUGHT ON THE WHTE SUPREMACISTS CHAT ROOM.. BUT ITS OK TO MAKE $$OFF US GO DO COUNTRY MUSC BITCH WTF I USED TO LIKE HER TIL I SAW HER TRUE COLORS..
Pues me encantó!!!
1:41, when your cause of death is by big twerking man buns😂
DOJA CAT MY GODDESS🛐🛐👌😪✨
STARSCREAM IS THE FUCKING CAT; I'm dead. XD  All Hail Queen Doja; Empress of The Intersection Between Sexy and Dorky ^_^
