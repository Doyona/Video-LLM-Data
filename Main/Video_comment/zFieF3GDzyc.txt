Do not touch Morata,!!!!Far too inconsistent and goes missing so many times.
Everybody,all the so called experts crucifying Maguire,Shaw. Just take a good look at Tottenham's pathetic defending today,far worse than UTD yesterday,all over the shop. They were more than lucky today,that from Tottenham today was worse than amateur!
This year: players don't want to come because we are not in champions league. Next year: players don't want to come because we play in championship.
How do you expect players to be sold when you give such crazy contracts to mediocre players?
I don’t think people will agree but losing every game before the transfer window closes is a blessing. A win would have meant no urgency in signings. Three loses means we go all out hopefully before the transfer window ends.
CR7 must go and save the club from all these setbacks ever since he came... His fellow prayers didn't want to play with him....
No need to buy De jong....nothing will change believe me guys
Notts County > Manchester United (sadly)
He isn't coming 😂
United go all out 😂😂😂😂
GUYSSS GUYS STOP IT!!!! PLS give CONTRACT EXTENTION TO CAP'N MAGUIRE till 2040!!! make him CAP'n and face of the club ETERNALLY!!!!
BOokmaR BLOG  Frenkie de young in Ronaldo to CHELSEA
We really need De Jong😒😒😒😒
In any other profession if you dont do your job you get fired how many players playing for Manchester United are not doin there job losing 4-0 to Brentford and games only in first half why are these players been played to not do there jobs it's my belief these players aren't even trying
Frenkie de Jong wants Chelsea move in further blow to Manchester United Matt Law
Frankie forced to Manchester
Screw morota
WE STILL NEED A DEFENSIVE MIDFIELDER. DE JONG IS NOT A BALL WINNER
WHY DOES GOLDBRIDGE TRUST OUR BOARD SO MUCH WHEN HE CAN SEE HOW INCOMPITENT THEY ARE
Erik Ten haag stag starting Maguire again 🤦.  Well that instantly means no clean sheet. We have Varane on the beach who recently  won 4 champions leagues And the world cup...  And he starts with MAGUIRE 🤡🤦🙈.
I think sancho ever since he came to united has been massively disappointing... Only thing going for him is that he is english
van de Beek and Martinez in mid feild , Thank me later !
Morata? Are we that desperate?
Well played Barcelona. Got together with Chelsea to make United pay the deferred wages.
If we don’t get De Jong, we should turn our attention to signing current PSV winger, Cody Gakpo (can play on the left and is quick!).  We should also try and snap up  VfB Stuttgart's highly rated forward and proven scorer- Saša Kalajdžić too.
What a pity! I don't think FDJ would be interested in MU at this time. MU need to see the reality now and focus on effective management.
Why city have spend 1.18b for pep in 7 year, and united cant spend for eth😤😤
A. Season long pressure to out the Glazers. B. Get FdJ. Let the rebuild start. C. Striker, striker, striker.
We will end up paying 100million and pay dejohn 350/week. MU will not allow this to become embarrassment.
Wtf are we doing with Morata😂😂, we’re being linked to everybody at this point. Won’t be surprised if I see Falcao coming to Carrington Monday morning
All in! For the fourth month in a row.  These clowns couldn’t buy a beer at the pub with a backpack full of cash
Not morata. God are they just signing every player that wouldn't cut it in the Premier league.
The clubs finished
Footballer Players should'nt have at much power the Manager should have power like old days!!
We are in for another poor season
You lot should have gon all out for gabriel jesus guys a baller missed a trick there
I will be surprised if we sign any more players in this window
Mark Goldbridge - I wouldn't pay that for morata...  Mark you don't pay anything, never have and never will. You have no influence at united and you don't impact any decision making.
Fergie called City the noisy neighbours.  Well now they've taken over the whole street.  Since fergie retired, City have never finished below utd.
It is also a good negotiation position to say you want a player to stay so if he goes you get a better price also if he chooses to go it’s not Teg  Hagg ‘s fault it’s the managers and owners from last season and before.
Ok , rashford doesn’t want to be here ?
What's happening with varane my god i expected more from him especially by now
Glazers out
I honestly  can't see you getting  a point at Brentford  that's how low its become. Totally  shambolic  out thought  as an organisation Utd are no more than mid table at the very best.
For God's sake, give it a rest about De Jong, you're as bad as Crook on Talksport, you've built this guy up so much, the pressure he is going to be under... 'IF'.....he does sign will be unbearable on him..he's not the Messiah he's just a Dutch footballer.....Seriously, if you think that this guy is the answer to all your problems you are stupid.. I can't believe all the weight you are putting on this guy's shoulders......give it a rest it's been 13 weeks of monotony.
GLAZER'S OUT GLAZER'S OUT GLAZER'S OUT GLAZER'S OUT GLAZER'S OUT GLAZER'S OUT GLAZER'S OUT GLAZER'S OUT GLAZER'S OUT GLAZER'S OUT GLAZER'S OUT GLAZER'S OUT GLAZER'S OUT GLAZER'S OUT GLAZER'S OUT GLAZER'S OUT GLAZER'S OUT
Banter club
Cody Gakpo, Frenkie De Jong and Anthony would surely be great signings. Trust me Ten Hag wouldn't sign either Morata or Depay.
I dont see why united haven't abandoned this de jong mess and just gone for neves. De jong doesn't want to play for united so even if we do get him is his heart going to be in it? Awful window and shows how far united have plummeted.
Barcelona are stinking, corrupt to the core. An absolute shambles.
Martial Sancho Rashford Gakpo Elanga Morata 🔥
I wish it was you Mark as footballing director with 100% decision power...as simple as that....whoever is now in charge doesn't love good football nor Man Utd, the cold harsh fact....
No chance FDJ is coming. I can’t believe any of this…they will let it run and end up with Rabiot. And use the excuse that the funds were in play with FDJ and they didn’t end up using them ‘cause they run out of time. We need Dumfries at RB and Savic in midfield. Get Depay as a stop gap for semi-cheap.
Holding mid of Martinez and FDJ might be revolutionary. I do believe our attackers and defense suffer more than anyone realizes without fearful impactful midfield
Boss, u have broken our hearts alot about transfers which never materalise
If we get De Jong, Morata, Rabiot and Gakbo ill be happy because this transfer window has been quite a shambles to be honest for us
Lmao I literally was 5 when the glazers came in
Morata is trash! 🤦🏽‍♂️
Rashford shoul leave
Man U isn’t a club that should be worried about an opening home game vs Brentford…. Very sad…. Very sad only.
Toomanyadsbridge🤣
Agreed, can't suddenly stop saying glazers out if they deliver Antony and de jong. With or without, they have GOT to go!
NO RIGHT BACK IN THE TEAM , BUT WE R WAITING DE FRAUD
Inside Frankies head. "Please God,anywhere but United"..........
I am more than frustrated on the De Jong saga. Even if they did sign him he can not play every single game of the season. Why is no one looking at Fabian Ruiz? Is he not a good player
Oh please not another De Jong story.
Pogba wasn't good enough as simple as that
Everyone needs to calm down and be patient.  We are one game into a new season with a new manager. This could take five years not five games. This is not his team and it won't be for a few years yet.
will buying FDJ and paying his wages bankrupt the club?  is that what the glazers want?  we will find out.
The FA and the English Premier League should’ve stopped them buying United back in the day they should take some of the blame as well
Mark You started your programme ,just like you have for the last 12 weeks ,De jong .Move on until we sign him .or let us know the real news each and everyday that you are told by your sources inside men at OT .Just stop the B<<<S.T
I would like tom davies to come in for fred and replace Fernandez with donny
30m varrati bargain do the deal .your value players mark way off 20 m for a championship player wake up
The fact United said no to Depay 😂😂 feeling like they are Liverpool or something
Morata in
Frenkie don't like United
again Frenkie? Rabiot is already approached for de Jong
If De Jong should’ve went United because it used to be a big club during the 90’s, he might as well join QPR.
Brentford 2.0
Lol 'frenkie goes to manchester' imagine that ends up being city in a hijack deal
Lmaooooo de jong is not going anywhere!
I don’t believe Ten Hag will get this team playing well.
I'm not 100 % this board can make this happen
Morata is not good enough
as for frenkie make your mind up already
WE WON'T GET DE JONG or Antony.
Better take draxler and icardi
Blame salty sour grape LVG for timber withdrawal. Then again, glad we got Martinez instead. 🤣
Funny thing about the De Jong incident, is we put interest in exactly 100 days ago. A club like Manchester United shouldn't be in this position which we're all aware of. Glazers need to go big-time. All they see is 💲💲💲. Can't believe now days we look to 4th place in the league. This is Manchester United after all. Glazers get the f#*k out NOW !!!
If we get the Glazers out we will be signing DeJong type (quality) players more often.
Why should our manager or our pass managers ever make it public that they’re not happy with a player if his agents are trying to get a move done!? Don’t you know that would only bring the value down! Speak sense!! You’re not a club owner, you’re not a agent stop it!
You spin some much negativity in our community straight facts!!
Glazers out at all cost they had there chance we need them out ASAP.
"The FDJ saga is coming to an end"  Thank God, so sick and tired of hearing his name at this point.
borrrrring... move on from FDJ
We ain't getting FDJ get over it
Morata 😂😂😂😂😂
Glazers out now 🤬🤬🤬🤬
I think we will see Martinez / Eriksen pivot today.!
This guys a f..king lunatic 🤣🤣 HE DOSNT WANT TO PLAY FOR YOU !!!!!
Hi!! I really wonder if we will and when we will try to put young lads like garnacho, garner, iqbal into first team action.  What do you think? And shouldn't they get more chances against sides like Brighton and Brentford??
that frenkie goes to manchester is the greatest ironic shirt once Frenkie does not join. i want one
The United team is excellent at the moment.  My Pro Evolution Soccer team, that is.
That team is miles off winning trophies,expectations do need lowered its hope more than anything else that we can win something,our best hope is europa because we aren’t winning a domestic cup
Would be interested to know how many de Jong videos have been uploaded since the start of the window and he is still rejecting you… hold onto the de Jong to Manchester shirts mark so we can have a good laugh at you
Best video I have seen Goldbridge do for a long time!! Not acting on his emotions 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾  The point about de jong might not be a success and some other bits
Also whoever said we should swap Ronaldo for Osimhen is smoking crack wtf 😂😂😂
FDJ was not good enough for Barcelona
We do not need De Jong on the wages he will be on just my opinion
Why did Liverpool spend 100M for Nuñez and we didn’t?
Just want Utd players pressing together as a team
Jesus Christ, how long does it take to sign one player?? a player who let's be honest, probably won't even make that much of a difference...
Morata is shite what are we doing
Morata would be a good signing it would be depth and something different.
Cant believe the board is bowing down to rashford, a player who is at best a poor man harvey barnes. He was probably one of the biggest leak last season and the bully who pushed Rangnick out.
Never win today
mark is a bit of a pleb haag fanboy, bit to biased
Honestly getting Frenkie would be a massive boost, come on United let’s get it done
Imminent FC but still nothing happens. Will Mark swing that shirt around his garden when FDJ has signed for United?
3:32 we know how significant this signing is? ahh maan. why have we not signed him yet. we can always get this done regardless what happens at Barcelona...soo confused ..this club...
Weve been all out for months
Aubamayeng is a way better option than Morata. I would put him n Icardi in the same underachieving boat.
If Rashford wasn't born in Manchester. You see the hate Martial and the Europe  players get,  He'd be in the same boat. Absolute trash player made into something he isn't.  I cannot stand the guy!!!
United couldn’t organise a piss up in a brewery
Morata is another Falcoa mistake..he is nowhere as good as people think he is..go get Evanlison..rather Ivan Tony over  Morata any day.
Morata as a forward in a pressing which demands pressing am not quite sure about it . De Jong i firmly believe will choose united because of ten hag incase he is forced out.
Mathias nunes
Great shout out to Maidstone fans  !! And anybody else from Kent ( grew up in Margate ! )
Rabiot is not the player for united
We are going for panic buys, this club doesnot have clear cut plans ...The club has incompetent people in the  post who are always a failure ...no matter which year it is...Glazer's are ruining the club day by day..look at the standard they have now
I predict loosing 2 - 0 and de jong not coming…🤷‍♀️
Hi Mark loving the show going by the ineptness or Arnold and murtogh these two couldn't organise a leg over in a brothel
Glazors out
Morata, Rabiot, De Jong would be a good set of signings
Time for the glazers to go they are strangling United
Refreshing YouTube every few hours hoping for good news from Marc.   I know I will be disappointed come end of August.
De-jong..😴😴😴😴😴
Amazed………?  Never 👎
Morata could well work in a Eth team he can bring others in to play
Wa you mean YOUR  not paying 30 mill , you do know you dont actually own united dont you lol
De Jong, Raboit and a offensive option would make me a bit more chilled but it is still not enough...
I would love to Martinez and Varane partnership. And donny with someone else and Eriksen 10. Bruno needs dropping...
There's Ruben Neves? Why go for a player that will be unhappy to play for utd, his wife will negatively impact his performance because she doesn't want to move to Manchester. This is a huge gamble. There are so many other targets Neves, Aouar, etc....
FRENKIE DOESN'T WANT YOUR CLUB FFS!!!
Loser team!!! You won’t get your players!
Please not rabiot
No injuries in midfield we are already in trouble already isn't it....
Same old crap from Mark! No surprise he is now on Talk trash radio!
Morata isn't a bad player tbh. Especially if we keep Ronaldo. Morata's main problem is that he doesn't know how to finish chances. A little bit like Martial. But his all round play is very impressive. Way better than Rashford.
Some of the comments Ten Hag is coming out with is not reassuring.   Total faith in Rashford & Maguire is not good.
Manager said any player who leaks things will be punished. Rashford puts this story out and the manager loves him, I’m not happy with that.
Most imortant this season, is getting the glazers out!!!!!!!!
buy lewandowski
alreet Michael here just like to say me and Ole can’t believe this news. Why do we need De Jong I mean I understand he would learn from being captained by Harry but we already have Mctominay and honestly lads in training he put Paul scholes to shame.
If we're gonna pay 30 million for Morata we should save that 30 million and put it towards Antony, J. David, Nkunku someone like that NOT A PLAYER WHOS NOT EVEN AN UPGRADE TO WHAT WE HAVE NOW
Dunno why people are blasting the board over this. This is the risk of going for de jong which is worth it. It’s so unlikely for a player like him in his prime to go to a club in such a bad state with no cl. A lot of things to blame the board for but brave enough going for de jong shouldn’t be.
Comparing football to cancer is one of the most stupid things you could have said.
Throw in Rashford for De Jong
Dé Jong doesn't want to join united
If we get De Jong I would feel more relax about this situation but right now we're staring down the barrel at a possible worst start to a season in premier league history. That has to be on the board.
they have to say that because they dont want booing on match day
Morata would be a terrible signing he’s a bang average striker at best
Confuse United
Frenkie will join Man Utd.They have obviously received assurances that he will join once the owed wages are sorted.Just relax 😁
We need to stay positive ,and we must remember that we've already won a Trophy this season against Liverpool in the pre season lol 😂
We need Morata like yesterday! He is great quality!👌🏽
I clipped FRENKIE TO MANCHESTER T SHIRT🤣🤣🤣
Morata is a good striker?? Never seen any player worst at missing sitters like Morata and Werner! How far the club have fallen to even have fans thinking this way unconsciously.
I trust your information  It appears that the fog is clearing
No big name strikers who will produce 12 goals...we need several hungry strikers if we can't compete for top ones...Morata is a risk
The glazers out movement won't be gone if we win and sign de jong. This muppet talks so much waffle.
Ronaldo definitely wanted to leave even if united bought players. Let’s not fool ourselves, he wants champions league football.
Sj
Best financial offer ie:- we will over pay him and pay more than we need too to get him
OOH get you Mark" Man Utd to blow Chelsea out of the water" over this poor mans Cruyff  lol. I Predict Frenkie goes to erm ? oh yeah NOWHERE.
Going all in now for De Jong what have they been doing for the past 12 weeks
I dont really care how much we pay. Im sick and tired of having mediocre players just because they want to be here. Most of whom are overpaid for their levels.
Why do you mention Bailly but not magwaya
I love Frankie De jone
Get Morata he's just a squad player and he will offer more depth in the sqaud which we seriously need . Cristiano can't play all matches and we even have europa to play .
Gonçalo Ramos Could be an option upfront, maybe Connor Gallagher to plug the sinking ship in midfield
We should be going for Belloti
If Mark stops supporting united, he won't have a job😂😂
I don't see then hag staying for long  I like him but he still keeps playing the players who need to be sold  And this de jong circus is stupid
It's was a bad day when religated,  its been worse since Glazers took over,  I was mad as hell when it was allowed to happen.
Even more powerful than rashford are the fans if we UNITE.
Manchester United the name used or rather abused by media to sell news 📰🗞️
United is not crippled by debt
As soon as you mentioned Frenkie De Jong i switched off sick of hearing his name
united need to get rid of shaw, maguire, degea, varane, bruno, mctominay, fred, elanga, rashford and ronaldo. otherwise a rebuild is impossible
Please no morata. He was sh*t for Chelsea and he will be the same for us
If you are the best player in 🌎 would you want to join man utd with the glazers there
I always liked Morata, but United fail to sign him. Infact he dyed his hair red because he really wanted the move, but then Chelsea sign him and he cut his hair bould
Should we sign belotti
So will pay £500k per week to de jong. Very sure he will come. Chelsea wont be a nut to pay that humongous salary. With a salary like that, de jong wont mind not playing in the champions league. Other better manage clubs like city or liverpool, definitely will never pay that stupid salary to any player, whether its haaland or nunez. Only manchester united is so stupid and so very desperate to pay salary like that. De jong knows no other club will pay so high a salary to him. And he wont make a difference to united's standard. It will be the same as long as ronaldo is still in the team. Team morale will even be worse if de jong comes in with that very high salary and couple with CR in the team, will expect united to finish in 6th to 8th position. Possibility of even ten hag to be sack.
Season will be over before squads complete.. Europa must be the focus for sure
this dude more and more sounds like a cult leader LOL and you are all his sheep 🤣
Next week FC, Next 48 hours FC
I think Cody Gakpo n Frenky de Jong are very important to sign for being success.
Icardi and rabiot here we go!!!
Get Frenkie to do medical at ManUnited
de Jong signing would be great, but isn't enough. We're still woefully short in so many areas of the pitch. We need another striker, a winger, a right back...the list goes on and on. So much time and energy has been spent on de Jong, it's exhausting.
I think I speak on behalf of most frustrated United fans in saying we are fed up with this situation we need action, we need to roll our sleeves up and really monitor the situation with De Jong and keep our best tabs on the developments and then see what happens. It's not about getting any player, it's about getting the fans and media to believe that if we manage to sign a player then we were right all along not to be held to ransome and take our time, going through a thorough process which we can and should all trust in, and if we don't sign anyone else, then it's because we were never in for any of them anyway because of the huge potential in our current squad.
Hope united get de jong. Hes wasted potential at barca but hes the problem solver at united
I hope de jong doesn’t come purely due to the mark ego boost   His reports are all False  He’s deluded
how are new signings meant to do well getting rushed in the door after the start of season
SAD
Rashfords a bully he deserves to be ridiculed
Desperate or not. If we got any decent offer for rashford like over 50m then he needs to go
You shouldn’t be using cancer as an analogy relating to football. You can do better than that mate!
Milenkovic savic and Ruben Neves will be perfect signing for Manchester United.
Them T-shirts 🤣 lol
Hi Mark, you've spoken a lot about the size of the transfer budget, but I don't remember any discussion about the wages budget which must be overflowing now that Pogba, Lingard, Matic, Mata etc have left. The Glazers have already made millions by not replacing them!
If you names Micheal Shanny put you hands up
Any any ?
Any hash about
For once, it's not United's fault that the De Jong saga has dragged on
Barcelona have threatened De Jong with criminal charges if he doesn't void his  renewed contract and go back to his previous contract conditions. They are a f***ing joke. I hope De Jong leaves them and sues the crap out of them.
Can't wait for dejongs first.interview as a United player "this is a massive club, happy to be here..."
Hey Mark, wat number did “DIVIDENDS” get & When Will He Debut?🤔
Not again
Didn't mark just told us last time that Frankie de Jong will make his decision in the upcoming 48hours?? now Manchester is going to make him an offer to get him next week???? someone help me is this guy just making up stories or did a miss something
No Morata plzzzz
Tommarow morning live on united stand... Its over , frankie snub united for Chelsea
I wish I had Fankie De Jong football skills. I would join United for free just to help the club.
Thing with Bruno is that he's a moments player. And when he doesn't produce moments, the team renders dysfunctional. He's incomparable to kdb
Rabiot and de Jong would be a fantastic midfield pairing.
FDJ Still need real talent around him in a United shirt....he doesn't have that at the moment....
I hope you will proven right Mark united need Frankie for sure
Oh no NOT MORATA PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!
Morata ffs
Like always big clubs buying that they want and we buying that is left😂😂😂,is just no ambition for MU 😡
GLAZERS OUT!🤬🔥🔥🔥 NOW & 4EVA!✊🏾🔥🔥🔥🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲
Milincovic savic is a beast💥 United must sign Savic.
United should look into depay, belotti for striker position, ziyech for right wing, tielemans and de Jong for midfield position, dest for right back
Morata? Are you joking?
Sergej milinkovic-savic I want at Manchester United now
I'd get wet between my legs if De Jong, Savic both signed! I need to stop dreaming.
No matter who comes in it won’t change anything.
If it was up to me …  Frenkie ✅  Gakpo  ✅ Morata ✖️
It's like united are trying to make a roast dinner by picking the scraps from other plates.
club in a right mess and ten hag coming out saying he wants to keep rashford makeing it even worser no ambition at this club at all poised from the very top to bottom
if Mcfred starts we will loose..
Im not that old and still glazers out even if they buy 10 players
I never think that FDJ didn't want to join us also i believe our new board in this case Arnold and Murtough is not as stupid as Woodward, i believe they see an opportunity to sign him if Frenkie really didn't want to join us i believe we already walked out from the negotiation weeks ago, i believe he's waiting for Barcelona to pay his salary which is completely his rights so i don't understand why those stupid Barcelona fans r bullying him it's not 100-200 euros but we're talking about 17 fucking million euros, once that problem is solved i believe he will come to us
Great! More players on mercenary wages that don't want to be here.
Bring ole back please
Manchester United too win 4-2
Why is Man United being linked with hundred of players but never get anyone done?
Get pique
If Ronaldo is scoring and Maguire is conceding  goals what does it mean 😏 🤔
CR7 stays! 🐐❤️
Utd will never improve with players like McTominay and Fred.
Frankie says Relax!!!  :D
A good friend of De Jong said he will leave Barcelona for United, at least that's what they said Yesterday on a dutch football show on tellie
Off topic got selected to test fifa23 just sold Magy to Chelsea45m Madrid50 and McT Bayern 26 if only it was real life
I don’t understand how mark is mentally able to do these shows day in day out, i gave up, and reading the news from time to time makes me hella glad i stopped watching these shows, rabiot arnatovic morata😂😂😂 idek what to say anymore
What a toxic ass club this has become
There's no more United in Manchester
The THUNDER DOME!✊🏾🔥🔥🔥🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲
I don't believe any of this
we should concentrate what players we have ,manchester are cancer brain everything is quit lets hope with manager to rise young generation only that.for this season best position 10th
man utd share price up 12%
He will stay at Brokealona unfortunately
Frenkie de Jong > Manchester United : HERE WE GO! ⭐️🇳🇱🔴
United need midfielder
Sausages
