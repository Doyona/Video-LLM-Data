Coach Optimus Prime Time has served notice to all of college football and thisbis the end of the typical status quo
Like Father Like Son Sonny❤Johnny Narcissism Duo  Ranked #1 Nat'l College Football         For:  Putting your Players and Teammates under the bus  No Accountability   Pathetic Sore Losers        GREAT JOB!!
Start with the human part of just acknowledging that the other teams offense can put points on the board. The QB for Colorado had a really good game against you.  All these excuses and finger pointing at the beginning show a lack of leadership
This guys is an ass lmao. Blaming them kids
He trying his best not to say they was better than us today flat out.
Respect this man for being humble. He said himself they didn’t even have a game film to watch because it’s a completely new team. That could’ve been their  only really excuse, but he wasn’t making excuses. He just got beat.
If were fifths we'd all be drunk! You got out played and out coached
The PAC 12  Teams are not Ready for The New Colorado Team those Players are more Physical an their Agility is of the Charts why do you thinkCoach Prime wanted players from Florida
TCU had one of the worst defensive performances I've seen in the last few years. What a joke. CU players definitely wanted it more.
He needs to give CO a lil more credit. Shadure probably misspelled that but he diced them up. 500 passing yards yeah your most likely gonna lose if you let the other team throw for 500 yards.
Stop blaming the players.  It's your responsibility as coach to have them ready.  You did not have them ready.. YOU, Dykes, were not ready.
Wow! Very little personal accountability as THE. HEAD. COACH.
"If this, if that" ... winners know better than to talk that way.  Unfortunately we live in the age of losers.  Just take a look around ... at everything.
Bottom line is u got out coached,outplayed and out conditioned!!!!!
I blame the head coach on game planning and conditioning program you are the head of the snake. The team should not be cramping up and they train in the Texas heat.
Both teams played great!!! It was the most exciting college football Game by fare. Hats off to both programs #gobuffs
Sometimes another team is just better than yours, coach
Would have been easier to say I didn’t prepare my guys I think its going to be hard to get your guys to fight after this interview
😂😂😂...conditioning ?😂😂😂...wow, what a bunch of BS.😅
I actually thought TCU played a good hard fought game.
Cry Baby Cry Baby😂😂😂😂😂
Dammmmm he ain’t no coach😂😂😂😂
🦬🦬🦬🦬🦬#RunRalphieRun
Simply said...they got outplayed, overpowered, and OUTBLACKED!!!😅😂
Man he looks so uncomfortable
20 point spread😂😂😂😂😂
No it would of been a different outcome if I was a better coach
You gave Deon and Colorado no credit on playing a very well played game!!     But oh well!!  You Lost!!
I aint hear Sonny give Shadeur no credit. The hate be crazy 😂😂 smh god bless the bitter
He seems to spend most of the time complaining about his players – he doesn't mention anything HE might have done better OR his staff, save for mentioning the conditioning differential between the teams and a little "we weren't prepared like we thought we were." Then again I stopped listening at 5:00
Damn He's so mad that he lost to a Black Man that he is throwing his team way way under the bus..... Racist in true colors ... 95 percent of the players on the field of TCU are black males...
Y’all lost to the better team and better coaching staff clearly
They threw bombs on y’all
Coach you stopped running the ball coach your fault
Your team got beat fair and square coach. Stop it.
You should have known you had a lot of work to do after Georgia
What about you stopped running the ball sir excuses
If if if if if.. smh.. just admit it Colorado look damn good.. smh..
Boy u better talk about tht QB tht put up 500plus yards with no interception. Mans dont want to give them Sanders credit. Atleast he talked good about Travis but yeah go #Buffs. TCU seems like yall got a coach tht sont believe in yall. Look how he talking vs how Prime talk to his team. Huge difference. I pretty sure TCU coach dont preach God to them boyz either. So trust me its the “we believe “ is why we won. Like we really believe while yall still doubting.
I Love Hearing Losers Make Excuses. Who Want To Play For A Coach Like This????,
That’s football coach!!!! That’s why we play every week and not giving wins by what’s on paper.  You got whipped.  “If”. If your grandma had nuts she would’ve been your granddaddy!
I thought TCU played well on offense wich was the big question.  They'll be good again this year under this coach.
In my life, I've never seen a recovery of a team in which the coach throws his players under the bus.
Let's be honest. TCU is not a good team and CU has better talent than TCU. I didn't think TCU was going to be a really good team this year, still don't. As far as CU goes, it's one game. That is all this was. You got Dumb Sanders talking about... Do you believe now? Like they just beat a good team, or won their conference. TCU has a very long way to go before there will be considered a "good team".
Lol, man ok cut the through the bs, all that being said, if Travis would've caught those 2 TD's it wouldn't even be close, credit to Coach Prime and the Buffs just said it Coach its ok to get beat by The Prime Time say it you lost that's it.....
This coach is a class act.
The DC has to be look at got blown out last year in championship game and gave 45 this game
JUST SAY YALL SUCK!!!! 🤷🏾‍♂️
This is an example of how not to lead your team. Lol 😂 good job coach
It wasn’t about your players not making plays on 50/50 balls , you got out coached !!   On offense you should have kept running the ball with y’all extremely talented backfield.    You relied heavily on your QB that just didn’t have it he missed some throws & threw some interceptions that were costly!!
Bruh don’t wanna give no credit lol, y’all played a hell of a game
Dam *coach* 😂
It's all about coaching get these kids off social media and hold them accountable.
Sonny you looked like the more inexperienced team. Colorado  looked like they have been playing together for years. Who fault is that Sonny?
Worst defense in the country jk but the 130th
Sonny says a missed field goal and two interception in red zone was the difference. well then let Colorado change three plays. ( like a blocked punt, Edwards fumble, and a ruffing the punter when tcu player threw him into the punter)
Won’t give any credit ❤. He ends his compliments with “but…”. 😂
This guy is not a leader. It’s no wonder his team didn’t play well. Throwing jabs at players in the post game week 1. Joke.
HE can't stomach losing to PRIME so he Blaims his Team!  Horrible Coach
Wow. What player would want to show up for this guy on Monday after hearing this?
A true leader will first place the blame on him or herself, not start off by pointing the finger at everyone else! Could it be that you and your staff were out coached ? Be a true leader and take accountability for the loss!
Damn brah can you give the buffs QB some credit he ate your defense apart all game long!!As Rodney Dangerfield would say “NO RESPECT”!!
"If we didn't miss FGs, throw  interceptions, miss blocks, clank tackles, commit penalties and put no pressure on the QB... it would've been a different outcome"  😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
TCU played in the national championship game in January and was ranked #17 this year. Colorado was 1-11 last year and was a 21 point underdog yesterday. Coach Prime assembled a new team from the bottom up and spanked TCU! They were beaten unmercifully on offense and defense with a lot of former HBCU players! Shedeur Sanders, Coach Prime’s son and QB, threw for over 500 yards. He too was a former HBCU player that people disrespected. Travis Hunter, is a beast and a former HBCU player. The national media and college coaches nationwide fussed Coach Prime, his players, and team! They messed around and found out!
So basically nothing was his fault lol, what a joke
Returning 7. The same same group of guys we watched in the national Championship.  Not to mention, a few touchdowns Colorado missed!  Happens to the best of them Coach. Travis Hunter is in a very select group of “anomaly” gifted athletes.  Give respect and keep it pushing!
If zero accountability was a person.
Their QB gave them this loss
What a trash coach. Way to throw your players under the bus man. The players we expected to help us win games weren’t able to do that??? Really wow
Travis the new bar for conditioning
blames his players ... that's why you got BLOWN OUT in the championship game. TCU was a fluke last year
Dude just say Colorado was better period.
Excuses excuses😂😂 Can literally say the same about some misplays they had on the other end as well. They just played harder and it was even for the most part.
Hunter must have been from a Hadza tribal.  They both can run for days.
His whole team smell like diesel under that bus hahaha
TCU coaching not prepared. Not last year for national title game and not yesterday. This white dummy doesn’t own it.
AND IF TRAVIS CATCHES THOSE 2 DROP TD PASSES THEY WOULD'VE LOST BY 2 TD & A FIELD GOAL  .. THEY GOT LUCKY IN A WAY BRUHHH 😅😏
Coach don't be hard on yourself and don't make excuses ! This was good Colorado team,  and it's the first game ! Don't start insinuating anything about a player that played great ! Travis a determined kid, and he didn't play every snap. Just say this isn't what you expected, I like TCU but they never had a great defensive squad. They offense always was the key,  plus their quick line up. Good luck TCU, y'all we be okay....
The hood wins again 💯
Did this guy really bring up 1 missed field goal and blast his players like that? Wow
If I’m a coach and the kid has TCU on their list of schools I’ll just show them this video
He is blaming players when he got out-coached?
TCU defensive is sub par. Colorado’s O line (which received very little recognition)gave Sanders all day pick apart the pathetic play of the secondary. Two poorly throw passes in the red zone by TCU . Poor performance by the TCU players. Colorado got what was given to them , a gift of a win
Shedeur Sanders passed for more yards (510) in his 1st Power5 game ever than any QB  in the history of CU. Wow, thats amazing.
Coach just doesnt want to admit he was out coached and decided to blame his players. Cmon man...
It appears the defeat from last years NATTY against Georgia is still hanging around.
Blame the players lol😂
coaching *EXPOSED*
Could TCU have kicked a field go or did they have to go for it ?
😂😂😂 he said Travis played 100 snaps but my players couldn’t seem to do it 😂😂😂😂
Well coached team?? They played well…?? And we didn’t… period
No compliments for Colorado??
Tcu shouldn’t have been ranked, this is not near the same team as last year. I’m more interested in seeing Colorado play a good team . Coach prime made me some money yesterday and I appreciate that .
I truly dont understand why so many sports people predicted Colorado would only win 4-5 games this year.   These is a completely new team and coaching staff.   Who wants to predict 9-10 wins now?
If I was one of his players and he threw me under the bus like that. I would be "Injured" for the rest of the season. When the coaches ask me, Why can't you play?  I'd say, I'm in pain... My feelings hurt!  Maybe next week coach?
You got your ass beat. Own it as the coach, and not cast blame.  Idiot
😂😂😂 we coming
Pitiful Performance on coach fire defensive coach TCU Fan did not have no heart today and that goes on the coach just like the Georgia game I think we should have hired Deion Sanders
Life's a B*!@# aint it Sonny
He makes it seem like all his guys didn't show up as if it wasn't a great game won by the other team and coaches
Hahahahaha
TCU is a good team they just didn't expect CU to be that good.
Throwing your players under the bus is weird! C’mon now
Lol... You got out played. Stop making excuses
Denial is a terrible disease. Get help before it’s to late.
Blame your DC for rushing 3 down lineman 80% of the time
blud really just blamed his team
Lol hell Naww who would want to play for this dude lmao
What I heard is TCU needs a Coach Moe in their camp.
Definitely should’ve ran it bad call
Dykes shows his true colors.
Defensively TCU play well but CU offense just that much better LOL. blaming on Defense.
when two great team plays, the team that makes less mistake win, so both team is great but CU is just a better team overall.
TCU play well and dont blame anyone, it just that CU was just a better team overall. period.
Hahaha Go Buffs and I'm a Michigan Fan. Analyst  hating on Deion Dont know Chit about having Heart and Football.
Just came across this vid and heard some bs. I heard this one reporter ask if he received a pregame handshake. Apparently, he trying to start some mess. Just ask the coach about the X’s and O’s. STOP TRYING TO START DRAMA. Great response coach sonny !
Back 7 returning from last year on defense. Last time they played they gave up 65 to Georgia. CU watched that game plan everyday and executed
Colorado QB #2 had a lot to do with TCU losing.....his poise, his accuracy, his confidence, his decision making, and his ability to extend plays; hope he stays healthy cuz he's a helluva QB!!!!
U mad bro??
I HOPE #2 TREY SANDERS TRANSFERS TO COLORADO.🤔
just say that colorado and coach prime beat us plain and simple and that we like the rest of the haters overlooked them.
Fact is TCU played amazing, the issue is everyone underestimated CU. CU is full of 5 star talent. They can compete with the best and they showed it.
One of those Interceptions was one of the greatest picks I’ve ever seen.
His team just isn’t as good as they were thought to be… And they got outplayed and he l doesn’t have the caliber of players Coach Prime has!
Props to coach Prime , as a 53 year old i remember watching him do his thing in nfl and mlb , he always believed in himself and now to instill that self belief into these young men is awesome 👍  His son is gonna be a superstar , such patience and a cannon for an arm . They gonna have a good season . Roll Tide on Saturday ! He we go Steelers on Sunday’s ! Loving football season is here !!!!
Lmfao.. what a shitty coach. Blaming everyone but himself and his coaches. No praise to his opponent other than after realizing maybe he's coming off to harsh so he had to change up and save face. But man this guy is a joke. If never play or a coach like that.
I will always support any PWI in a blue state with a black head coach. #GoBuffs
I wonder what hurts more… losing to Georgia 65-7 or losing to Colorado a 21 point underdog??
TCU is the Patrick Ewing of the NBA, they just played during an era of Michael Jordan.  TCU was the first piece in Coach Prime Chess move.
Colorado bear them with heart. TCU players was larger and more powerful.  Tcu had a great running game. They beat themselves And another note he was out coach LMAO
Look, please stop saying, "Colorado players didn't cramp up in our heat. We thought they were going to cramp up and they didn't."  You are aware that all but three players from Colorado's team that went 1 and 11 is gone, right?  Plus, the majority of the 58 transfers to Colorado and Coach Prime are, wait for it...FROM THE SOUTH!  So, they are use to that heat!  Besides, you were already losing, if you expected the HEAT to be your 12th Man!
Two straight games where Dykes the Defensive Genius showed off his true worth.  This last one, on his homefield.  Humiliation at home.  Is that worse than on global TV?  Maybe not.  But #1 and #2?  Yes.  Probably so.   Dykes is taking TCU to new depths, although I realize he just needs another 8 or 15 years of recruits.
NEWS FLASH:  The buck stops with YOU coach!  Stop blaming everyone else.  🙄
I hate practice for them on Monday😂
I'm sure this guy hasn't slept in weeks! 😴🛌🛌
Coach took zero responsibility threw his players under the bus and gave zero credit to the better team. Yuck. Good luck TCU..
NAW Y'ALL GOT OUT PLAYED!!! MR. PRIME HAVE A MASTER PLAN!!! EVERYBODY JUST CONTINUE TO SIT BACK AND WATCH!
All n All, they only lost by 3. It's not the end of the world. Both teams need to get better on defense. CU can NOT rest on this win. They gave up 42 points. This game could've gone either way. I hate the way the losers are being treated but imagining the level of hatred that would've been projected on Deion if he'd lost, I'm glad it happened this way. TCU can bounce back.
watch last year’s game tcu won because cu had crappie pay calling
Excuses 😂😂😂
He said they played flat and not how they played in the national championship game- you lost 65-7 in that game.
TCU defense sucks last season
This is what taking 0 accountability sounds like and looks like. Sonny the sad face clown. He's unqualified. Buddy system hire. Nothing more. Congrats Dion Sanders and Colorado Buffs.
He is denying that Colorado and Dion were GREAT!...Chump!
CONGRATULATIONS ON SO MUCH VIEWS ON THIS VIDEO BRODY .. KEEP GOING UP !!!! 💫💫
Travis Hunter, dont drink he dont smoke he has amazing genetics he takes care of himself like a kobe or lebron or a Tom brady. None of your players take care of them selves half of what hunter does
He gave a lot of credit, good coach here too
In just one interview, the coach lost the respect of his players.  No good coach, would ever publicly blame players, and then expect them respect them.  Good luck TCU Football players, wish everyone a safe health season.
I'm glad to see Colorado back what they say, GO BUFFS
Never seen a coach throw his players under the bus like this…damn
Karma: Many breaks went TCU's way in '22. "Not today,  Zerg."
You also got outcoached!
Which '23 disaster on d' was he referring to? The CU loss or ncg disaster?
Lmao he got exposed last year was luck rofl then he talked tht noise bout prime during the off-season bahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
This man is a Great coach. 1 bounce of the ball changes all the questions from the media. Coach was going to have the same questions win or lose.
He sick😂 You underestimated Colorado and got beat
I mean I'm from Texas but TCU needs to stop the bullshit about cramps and guys on the Def didn't step up. CO was way better then they thought they were going to be and I didn't hear anything about bad coaching decisions.
Wow he was really throwing guys under the bus left and right. There’s a right way to have accountability and a wrong way. Give Colorado credit they played some inspired football. And honestly your team was game and fought hard as well. Was an excellent game to be honest.
Your QB is high school level.  Is that all you have at that position?  Yikes!
It would be one thing if TCU just had careless turnovers.. CU forced every turnover
Let’s be real it has nothing to do with the kids both sides played their hearts out in this game. I watched the game from start to finish. The difference was coaching. Deion Sanders beat you as a coach.
Thank goodness coaching had nothing to do with it.
the Defensive Coordinator didn’t help his players by scheming the CBs to give Colorado WRs 10 yard cushions on 2nd and 1 and 3rd and 1. Wtf is that? He should be fired and the HC is watching it and said nothing about it? Seriously?
You got out-coached, quit blaming your damn players.
TCU irrelevant
You weren't that bad. It was that they were that Good. Give them their Credit and Props. Please.
If if was a 5th we be all drunk Sonny
Players looking at that 20 point favor all week,and got kicked in the ass
Yes we weren’t excited,I was around all week long near Campus?there wasn’t any 🔥🔥🔥,cone on students and fans and all FT Worth let’s get together!!yes I understand it was the 1st week of school,so let’s leave it behind and GO FROGS
So because u got out classed in ur house it’s somebody’s fault naw the just beat that asphalt oh I’m cramping oh bullhockey lol 😂 😂😂😂😂
Coach is Gard but he’s fair?🏈💜
Dude blaming everyone else 😂😂
What a sore loser. This is not going to sit well with his players!
FACE IT!!! Y'all got lucky Against Us and now the TRUTH is being exposed !!! GO BLUE 〽️
Out coached. Out classed.
Was at the game it was Electric ⚡️ Wake up call,we will still have a wining season and go to a Bowl ,and win !! For all the new recruits
Coach Prime, we coming to DOMINATE ❤❤❤ 💯 💯
Dykes is a class act
Meanwhile Dion gave this guy praise and respect in his post-game interview, which is why you always have to be careful not to put people on a pedestal.  They could be pissing on your head from up there. 😂
This coach is blaming his players smh
Ok y’all had miscues lol he saying  it the buffs didn’t as well   Imagine hunter caught that long ball or Dylan didn’t fumble or the LB didn’t get that dumb roughing  the passer penalty that’s 21 pt swing  right there   Cmon coach stop it
Deon Sanders turn Colorado Buffs around in one year!  Freaking amazing!
Colorado strength and conditioning coach is top notch
What he say… A game hasn’t been won by talking 😂😂😂
You forgot Travis Hunter dropped a touchdown in the end zone so you should of lost by 10
No accountability… just admit it. Outplayed, out coached. It happens!
Man, CU was just better today. I hear a lot of excuses.
He's blaming the players what a loser coach
The picks wanst just picks. They were incredible defensive plays! And that's the facts!
Lol damn he just threw his whole team under the bus. Didn’t hear not one ounce of responsibility placed on himself
😂😂😂😭😭😭😭
give Colorado credit  they offensive coordinator is elite! And their defense made special plays in the right moments of the game . That quarterback looks heisman ready
Never ever once said The other team played a good game. He's Clearly racist and it pissed him off that a group of Black kids beat the shit out of him
Don’t forget Travis Hunter dropped a td pass and Feely had a lock fg attempt. This game shouldn’t have been as close
buddy this shit wasn’t supposed to b close, CU REALLY HAD 2 dropped touchdowns maybe 3, with one called back……. TCU got f*cked
Coach Prime is the Man... TCU just plainly got spanked ,,they underestimated ,...   And they werent prepared ...
You're out coached, and blame your team😢
Colorado will be the top dog in the Big 12 🐃
This is how you make a wine with sour grapes.
I heard a great quote from an NFL Coach that said, "Next season does not begin where last season ended." There was not a greater example of that than this game.  Last season ended with TCU in the National Championship game, and Colorado was 1-11. Dykes even says during the press conference that he "thought" his team would be more fired up coming off the success of last season. I mean, these guys are next level coaches, and still get caught up in the hype.
4:28. Came out flat, just admit you didn’t expect the Buffs to show out.
KING DAVID defeats racist Goliath ... Again.  Richard Wright Black Boy
Never underestimate the power of PRIME TIME!!!!
I think the most telling thing in this interview is he said we played in the championship game so how could we come out flat. This is not the same team. Every year the team changes, he stuck on last year’s victories
Congratulations to the  x-Bama players that left to join TCU, I’m sure the future will be bright for you guys, RTR FOR EVER!!!!
This dudes a chump
That sounds more like I can't believe we lost to them. In the end the game could have went either way, when it should have been a blowout favoring Colorado. Hats of to TCU kids they fought hard but they ran into monster that is only going to get bigger and uglier.
Stop the bullshit excuses and give credit where it’s due! It was a great competitive game and your team lost! You wasn’t prepared because you didn’t believe! No pun intended 😂
He through the players and his staff under the bus!!!! Gahhhhh damn! No accountability!
Congrats to the horn frogs!!! Yall was apart of history yesterday!!!!
This 🤡 of a coach. Colorado spotted his team 14 points in the 1st half.  He returned 5 starters on defense and 6 on offensive and he and his staff had 8 months to prepare for this game which they LOST 😂 to a team that returned 1 starter from a season ago and had 12 weeks to prepare for his team.  This "coach" is throwing his players under the bus 😂
"Must be the Money" 😁😁
Low key throwing his guys under the bus without naming them… Sheesh..
Horrible. No accountability!!! Take some of the blame!!
Classy guy
Travis Hunter..smh.. WhoooO 💥
Cmon Coach....stop the excuses..your team put up mad numbers and got beat...you got outplayed and the coaching on the other side was better,,,
He is in shock....stunned even. He really doesn't know what to say. His team got beat by "Colorado University". The reality of the quality of the NEW CU team is throne him (and the rest of the competition) into something. They should've have watched their Jackson State film. Then they would've been more prepared.  Although, it was an EPIC game!!!! I'll be watching ALL season... and I don't normally watch college football, just the NFL.
Classy press conference by a classy coach.  Totally different than the press conference from Coach "Prime".
Dang coach, you really pushing players in front of the bus…!🤔 You played a good football team and just got beat. Take a look in the mirror coach🪞 their only as strong as their leader.😕
That coach needs to be fired...how u let a hbcu team and a 1-11 team beat you. Nothing this coach say can save his ass. Tcu was in the bowl last year...and end up getting beat by Coach Prime with this first game of the season. If Colorado get there defense right...they are going to be a force to recon with. Every team get beat by Coach Prime and Colorado this year...fired. Man's son made Colorado History on yall....shameful.
Same team GA embarrassed in the Championship 🏆 Game 😂..... what did anyone expect?
So this clown gets lit up and blames the players, own it f a t h e a d.
Stop whining coach 😢😢😢😅. You got your butt kicked fair and square.
Got that ass beat by ga and haven’t recovered.
They're better than you guys.
trav dropped a tud and a pick ona possession tcu scored .. erase the fumble and the special team errors this a blowout
Wow he threw his players completely under the bus it's on the coaching staff
More importantly how about realizing sir you was out coached..you have but only once mentioned y’all quote weren’t prepared..you got punched in the mouth..you can’t come back correcting mistakes for point because Colorado left points on the field..you all thought with all that took place in Boulder you all were a better team and you couldn’t over your own confidence..you thought it was going to be a walk thru..rack’m..
He is hot that he lost to coach Prime you can see it in his face
Am I hearing this coach throwing his guys under the bus?
This is why you don’t build teams through transfer portal hard to gauge your program year in and out this is a completely new team from last year
What’s hurting him the most is he lost to a black HBCU coach and QB just say it !!! Prime Time Baby We Coming 💯
Fire this man all excuses no real shit. He said somehow travis hunter played all game nigga he like that foh
TCU NOW HAS A 2 GAME LOSING STREAK. IF I WAS A TCU FAN, I'D BE PISSED OFF! BUFFS HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO!
Bro they are going to run 100 sprints after this one.. 😂
This coach sounds like he bout to transfer to Colorado as well lol😅
So sad! A big time coach like Sonny Dykes doesn't give a BLACK QB acknowledgement who put up unprecedented number on them.  IS White Supremacy all day. Well get ready for the New America we are bout to take it BACK.
No Coach for any football team in the world has accomplished and seen more than Deion.. what he's able to instill from actual experience obviously a big difference and there's gonna be a lot more interviews like this from a lot more coaches this year 😂😂🤷🏾‍♂️💪🏾👊🏾
Some coaches say all the wrong stuff 😂
It never was a clean window Travis baited the qb to throw it
Just admit it if shaduer hadn’t missed on those passes tcu would’ve been beaten out by at least 2-3 touchdowns
Wow, he through his star players under the bus!!!!!!!!!!!!!
LOL ! TCU has given up 110 points in their last 2 games.
TCU didnt even belong in the playoffs last year
Boy he sure don't want to give Colorado credit y'all got beat fair and square stop saying this and that give that man and his team some kind of due you got beat.
The thing you did today was get your ass kicked by a team no one gave a chance to you Bummm !!!
Dey bout to fire his a** 😂😂
COACH PRIME AKA "BABY MOSES" JUST DOES WHAT YAH/GOD( FOR THOSE THAT DON'T KNOW) TELL HIM WHAT TO DO....SON GO WIN! AND WIN BIG!!!! BUFF'S OR NO BUFF'S.. JB.ok
TCU will be remembered in 2 ways…. Getting drugged by Georgia in the Natty and then starting the next season as Prime Times 1st win 🏆
Just like on moneyball it will last until the bigger schools start copying what coach Sanders is doing.
Way to throw your players under the bus.  You didn’t have them ready and prepared to play oh 60 minutes point blank. You got outcoached out programmed.
I think y’all last t he game to a better team. They missed a FG too.
Coach isn't blaming players he's stating facts..... y'all be the same people complaining about participation trophies but mad when a coach holds his players accountable
2 end zone interceptions did the Frogs in.
This was clearly a shootout and both teams made costly mistakes. This coach is getting too emotional and isn't seeing things clearly. Ya'll played a good game man. You just came up short, nothing more, nothing less.
LMAO!!😂 In other words yall beat yourselves? Nah bruh...Colorado beat yall! PERIOD!! Coach Prime!!💪🏾👊🏾👑
So let me get this correct, UT made a lot of mistakes, the other coach say his team made a lot of mistakes too, NBC the mistakes on both sides😅, but the truth is you just got out play, give credit and move on. (The real truth is you did not prepare the team, to play prime Time players, they had nothing to lose but everything to gain, it showed)
Give credit where credit is due..
Can't help but think that this is how King pharaoh, Goliath and his believers looked and spoke after going against God's chosen people ... Not bad for a couple of HBCU athletes. Ya'll better get with the program. White ice is not colder then black ice. This man's face and attitude is the derivative of privilege.
TACKLE BETTER ? YOU CAN'T TEACH HOW TO TACKLE EDWARDS POSSIBLY 4.1 SPEED.. LIKE SHEEESHHHH 😅
He just lost the locker room after this presser.
HONESTLY, COLORADO COULD'VE WON BY 2 OR 3 TOUCHDOWNS  😏🥴 THEY LEFT AT LEAST 2 TOUCHDOWNS IN THE FIELD FOR SURE ..
Should have ran the ball.
He was throwing shade on his own team low key 🤣🤣
Most coaches admitt finally they got beat
LMAO 1:57
They all fina transfer to Colorado 😂
Sorry frogs the buffs are here
TCU took Colorado for granted, did not prepare.  on the other hand, Colorado played incredibly well and deserve to win.
Them boys in boulder HUNGRY
ITS GOTTA BE DEVESTATING TO LOSE TO THE TEAM ALL THE SPORTS MEDIA TALKED SHIT ABOUT … but facts are their a good team! Y’all didn’t lose to bums THEIR FKN GOOD! THE MEDIA IS WOKE
Shedeurs Sanders looked great for a SWAC QB vs a power 5….. JSU 45 - TCU 42 🤷🏾‍♂️ 😂😂😂😂😂
Dykes stop being a crybaby whiner. Good grief. You need to show leadership and not throw anyone under the bus but your fat ass. Do a better job preparing your team and you you whiny little crybaby take but yet take the blame for the team you're a shameful you're shameful you're shameful. And just witnessed Primetime baby you just witness Primetime how does it feel to step in the world of a real football coach who cares about his players and won't throw them under the bus like your whiny-butt did
Excuses are weak! Colorado just better!
Excuses, excuses, excuses. The Buffs had mistakes, too. Huge plays that should have been made, poor special teams and poor defense. You just got beat! Those redzone turnovers were made by young men that came to play. That's part of the game. Special performance by a team that had a belief that they could shock the world! They did and your boys didn't. That's the game.
Differnt when some koolaid in it
Sonny got nothing to be ashamed of his aquad played there hearts out,and him and prime shared a moment in the middle of the field. After you loose your toes it's hard to walk right.
TCU will be lucky to remain in the top 25.
Shoulda just said: “Colorado was a 1000 times better than we and most people thought they were and punched us in the mouth”….
Don't be too hard on yourself Sonny. Your guys ran into a buzz saw today. Deion has three of the best players in college football & his team was an extremely well disciplined professional group of players out for blood.
Blame blame blame lol come on coach
We are here full support Coach Sonny.  #TCU
Inside the CU cafeteria. On the drink machine… it says:  Players: water or Gatorade only.  That’s how serious they are about their conditioning.
fire this excuse making blame placing chump!! if your team wasn't ready to go out there and win that is your fault as the head coach for not having them ready and or not putting them in place to succeed..
Lol this is the sound of a pissed of coach who in Deion words “didn’t believe” 😂 He threw everybody under the bus players coaches even the nutritionist
TCU been trash and should never been in the playoffs last year.
#2 THREW for 510 yards brother 😂😂😂😂😂😂 and the way this coach talks about his players …….good luck this season lol
Quick throws? Shedder was poise in the back field. He had enuff time to prepare a five course meal
That kid Travis Hunter is different unbelievable talent.
Sore loser 🤦🏾‍♂️. U got out coached just admit it. Stop blaming the players that’s how u lose respect
Y'all saying he throwing his players under the bus but this is regular post game critique of your program.. those 2 picks and the missed field goal was definitely the difference.. he told no lies
Not that Nicholls St. ever thought they would beat TCU...but we may see a 100-0 game next week. Bad timing for Nicholls....
I respect this coach’s, honesty, and assessment of the game. Also, I think he has a crush on Travis Hunter 😂 Nah, travis was extremely impressive in that game tho
This is the worst post game presser I’ve ever seen. Snotty, monotone, dismissive, and brutal on everyone but himself. Pathetic. TCU should fire this moron or their run near the top is gonna be over quick. Imagine a recruit seeing this moribund nonsense.
Colorado QB is a lot better than TCU. Im a fan. I wasn't happy with you guys
u mad bro?
Tre sanders need to come on to Colorado, join the family son, your last name already fits
Coach Bus Because he threw everybody under the bus but himself players,kickers, strength and conditioning coach the band 😅😅😅 you name it....wear that azzzz whooping Prime gave you son lmao
This was a disgraceful performance by the TCU coach. You can't lose home games when you're 21 point favorites! You just can't do it. The TCU defense got gashed! Couldn't stop the pass.
Class guy.
Sooo…it was the players (offense and defense) the training staff, and the nutrition staff. Coaches aced it though. 🤣
Jesus -1  TCU -0
Admit it . Your team got dragged over the field. Prime is the truth. Do You Believe?
The Heat is no excuse. TCU practice in heat and Colorado practice in higher altitude. There are no excuses Donny Sykes
So much for likable ‘ol Sonny Dykes. Was he doing an impersonation of Jim Mora trashing Peyton Manning and his other players in that infamous post game presser, or is he feeling like a failure having now lost two games in a row? Whatever. Just own it, coach.
Travis Hunter i believe is the best player in the country
This coach sounds like a sore loser blaming everybody else and talking about if sorry but if didn’t happen take ur lose and learn from it and move on
Embarrassing is what it was. Totally ridiculous
1:09 😭😭damn he said it was them not me
This man is bitter, he acts like he let the entire white race down by losing.
U got out Coach & Colorado made more plays... don't Blame ur players deyy played hard!!!!😎😎😎💪🏿🏈🏈🏈💯
Sonny Dykes thought this was gone be a walk in the park lol
Wow.  Just cannot believe the coaches response.  You got beat.  Your the coach.  You take the blame, not throwing players under the bus.  Your team got out played, out hustled, and out coached.  Admit it and move on!
Should’ve stay with the run up the middle,, take the blame on to next week 🦬🦬🦬
Let’s be HONEST, the CU team was put together in 3 months. They are still building, them dawgs will eat
Y’all need to know that majority of CU’s team is from the south, so the heat and cramps wasn’t gonna be a problem. Now that they have some real athletes and skill players, conditioning at this altitude up here is real at 5280ft above sea level. GO BUFFS🦬💯💯
Yea Yea Yea blame everybody but yourself. All those things are true but you were also outcoached take some responsibility
This game could have gone either way and that is not a compliment to TCU, but then again TCU HAD NO BUSINESS IN CHAMPIONSHIP GAME LAST YEAR.
Coach Man on man on a 3rd and long was not a smart defensive play call !
QB couldn’t hit the ocean with a rock
This guy underestimated and got whooped. 😂
TCU was just terrible in my opinion. I believe a FCS team would have beat them.
Very sally, man.
You lost! Plain and simple! Give Colorado their dues, they won and uou lost!
Hole-e-sh*t.
Rewatched and it was not the coaches, but the players he was counting on did not perform. 0:40. Sorry. Coaches should never do this.
Great overall game! Both teams!
Well? The Buffs had some screw-up plays too...but, your D sucked again as it did all last year.
He looks really unhappy during this interview. More than any losing coach I have seen recently.
Wow trashed his star player good luck the rest of the season
Way to throw your team under the bus 🚌 there Coach  Great job ❗️
Won’t be a surprise if several of his players enter the transfer portal after this interview.  It could have gone either way in the fourth quarter Colorado just made a few plays more than TCU.  Good game to both teams.
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😢😢 what happened 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😞😭😞😭😭😞😭😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
Turnovers & penalties. Both defenses were horrible.
TCU played one helluva game. Your players should be very proud of themselves.
Black college  qbs can ball 😊
new coach incoming🔜
Sounds like Coach speak for “we were overconfident and it cost us”
Game was fkn lit 🔥
Excuses  sad  the buffalos made mistakes to coach very sad interview I’m sure your players would say we just got beat
Why all of the excuses. Just say we lost and we get better. It was a great game. No shame in the L. The better team won, period.
I believe he was delusional concerning how prepared the Colorado Buffalos were for everything they gave them. The CB’s conditioning surpassed their’s. The QB was better…more accurate. The CBs made a few chippy mistakes that helped TCU not get blown-out. This Coach is pretty salty.
Excuses, Excuses. You lost hands down. Colorado wasn't supposed to score plus 40 points on any team let alone TCU...
Travis hunter played every snap our strength and conditioning coach😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Sonny, if my grandma had balls she would be my grandpa.
Whoa....kinda harsh on his own guys there.
Pathetic that this coach blamed the loss on their mistakes and lack of performance by some of his players!  How about a Colorado team that played better than your team!  The opposing teams QB doesn’t throw for over 500 yards for no apparent reason!
TCU was holding alot. Especially on their highlights. Poor technique
He tars ni accountability and threw his team under bus 😂 class act ... He deserves every part of this L
No accountability on him and his staff blamed the players smh
He used Travis hunter to shoot the slug at his whole team
Looked like a spring game. TCU defense is non-existent.
in FOOD terms this dude is unseasoned chicken and prime is marinated ribeye!
He’s throwing all his players under the bus, he thought this was a walk through. He not taking any blame for bad coaching..💯💪🏾💯
😂😂😂Y'all thought this shit was going to be a cakewalk. Tell the truth you got outplayed Dykes😅😅😅
I like how this Coach handled the loss. Professional, not hating on Coach Prime or the players. Simply called it how it was, unfortunately came up short. Respect 💯
Those guys played good but  Colorado was better.
Thanks for Watching! Don't forget to Check Out All of Our Colorado vs. TCU Videos & Subscribe for more College Football Content!
Over 500 yards passing on y'all butts, with only 9 incompletetion, WOW
Mans was blaming everyone but himself.. strength & conditioning coaches, players, etc
I don't follow TCU but Coach Dykes is amazing - this post press conference is terrible. Sounds like he's pointing fingers. "I expected that and I felt this" type remarks. It was a hard-fought game and could've gone either way no team was backing down - whoever scored last was going to win the game. I know that's a stupid thing to say but in this case it fit the narrative.
That Colorado altitude has them bois conditioned for anything
That 3-3-5 defense doesn't work!!!
TCU and Dykes put on a worse performance than against Georgia.
Man, like I said last season.  After that ole fashion butt whoopin In the National championship, then losing to a 1-11 last season Colorado.  Tcu definitely had that one hit wonder season..
Poor defense on both sides.
TCU clearly weren’t ready to play. I feel they were also completely out coached in every phase of the game!
tcu played fine but colorado was just better today, shedeur sanders played lights out
The horned chokers 😂
Coach is not a leader
Soooo coach what was the shit you said during media day?
He doesn’t want to say “our coaching staff will never even hope to sniff the level of football knowledge and experience on Prime’s team” because that wouldn’t sound great for him. Lol
Wow!!! Now I know why players want to play for Coach Prime.. Who wants to be thrown under the bus
This team played a Great game they just came up short but there's no reason to hang there head. Continued BLESSINGS to both teams💜💛🖤🙏🏾
You lost to a TEAM and brotherhood. Which is a testament to its leader and head coach. Take notes
The CU BUFFS could've put up over 60 points if Travis Hunter didn't drop one TD pass and, for his second pass catch, if he didn't have his right foot out of bounds; the blocked field goal by TCU, and Travis Hunter's dropped interception, which would've been his second interception of the game. So, yeah, the CU BUFFS would've possibly blown TCU out 🤷.
The coach is more embarrassed for himself. They lost to a non ranked team at home, Colorado is talented but they have quite a few portal transfers, you gave Coach Prime his first major big boy win on the road and as expected he was beating his chest and promoting his program as well he should but you are now a trivia question.
YOUR GUYS MISSED DYLAN EDWARDS IN OPEN SPACE BECAUSE HE'S FASTER THAN THEM??? IT'S NOT THAT HARD SIR?? IT'S PHYSICS!
@TCU fans hold that “L” expeditiously!!!! The fans chanting FU to prime as he made his walk out from HT and making all those disgusting posters about his foot and so on, yea we know it hurts but yall picked and chose the right time to make those jokes now the jokes on you right out of the rankings! Then this guy throwing players under the bus 😂😂😂😂 I love the frustration from everyone ❗️  We ain’t coming no more, WE HERE  #WeCame #WeConquered #WeWon   Shoulder To Shoulder  #SkoBuffs 🦬🧏🏾‍♂️  Top 25 Make Room For “Big Prime” and the GANG ✅
If Shedeur hit the two deep balls, Dylan didn't fumble, and Travis caught at least 1 of those two picks that he missed Colorado would've won by 24 or 28 points.
CU won the game, but you can't compete every game without a running game. TCU got themselves a big tough running back. CU needs a running back like him as well. It's tough to be successful without a running game. Travis Hunter shouldn't have to play every snap. I was impressed with CU's offensive line, but their defense can't handle big running backs.
After getting beat 65 to 7 in your last game, you have no reason to come out flat against anybody.
Dude outright threw his team under the bus and this is after the fact that he called out Deion to the media. Hope recruits are watching.
Fair assessment as Coach Dykes spread blame around. I hope 56-7 doesn’t haunt Ft. worth for years like 28-3 in ATL.
Man, that's weak...
TCU coaching was the main reason for the loss.  TCU should have stayed with the run game. This loss is on the coaches as well as the players, but the buster coach blamed his players. 😒
U kno they mad when they asking about a pre game shake smh
CU had a fumble and blocked fg, too... Stop with the excuses. You cannot pick 1 play out of 100s. It was an all time great game, regardless. What if CU doesn’t get a blocked fg or doesn't fumble?? They would have been up 17.
Way to call you players out coach. 🤦🏾Didn’t mention coaching though
Don’t blame the players, blame the coaching staff that didn’t have them prepared enough. You complained about the missed plays on offense, your team put up 42 and gave up 45. Special teams played GREAT. But the defense is your main concern.
Lots of guys are in shape to play both ways. Not many are good enough at this level. Especially at corner and wide out. He can catch.
Don't feel too bad, coach, you have a very good team.
Shedeur and Hunter were the difference. I am sure the rest felt it.
Criticism is easy. Until you play Colorado. Colorado made big mistakes too. It balanced out.
Hungerier team won
You don't score 42 points and lose!  Hand it to the Buffs. They were ready to play! Aside from Hunter, it  boils down to coaching!  Admit it, you underestimated your opponent!
I REALLY dislike it when losing (college in particular) coaches "point fingers" at their players.    It's a gutless, cowardly, "cheap shot" practice.  It's even worse because the "power structure" in college football is basically one-way:  coaches have the microphone and have the ability to hold the press captive -- NOT the players.  And even IF college players had "equal access" to a microphone, there is NO WAY they would ever DARE to criticize their meal ticket coach.  As for the poor plays, EVERYONE can see the video/tape highlights for themselves; we don't need coaches to try to "take some of the heat off themselves" at the expense of their kids by stating the obvious.  Everyone knows that red zone interceptions, missed tackles, missed field goals, etc. help lose football games.  We do NOT need or want to have kids by name -- or even by specific position (e.g., "we have a returning all-conference kicker [who missed a 42 yd FG] ...") -- "called out" by their coach.  ESPECIALLY when it's a game at the beginning of the season AND when it was a highly competitive, close game by BOTH teams (hardly a "blowout") !!!   These players are UNPAID/NON-PROFESSIONALS (or at least they're supposed to be) ... and some of these kids are even still teenagers.        By contrast, NFL coaches do a much better job deflecting criticism, "shielding" players, and even "bending over backwards" to AVOID "calling out" their players.  Ironically, where the NFL is concerned, such pampering is WAY OVERBOARD in the OPPOSITE extreme --  sometimes going so far as to "make excuses" and engage in vanilla/disingenuous coaching "doublespeak" [e.g., "I can't comment yet;" "I didn't see it;" "I have to watch the tape first," etc.] -- which is MADDENING because NFL players are GROWN MEN, they are OBSCENELY WELL PAID for their services.   THEY have "big enough shoulders" to be able to withstand DESERVED criticism for failing to do their well-paid jobs properly.  But NOT college kids.      On a different thread ...  Big time CONGRATULATIONS to "Coach Prime."  "Neon Dion" really had his kids well-prepared, well-conditioned, and well-coached to win a BIG GAME on the road against a QUALITY opponent.   When he was younger and a player, I sure did NOT like Dion Sanders' showboating and flashy self-promotion ... but he is a good dude and he deserves a ton of respect.  Colorado is legit, and I think they will finish the season in the Top 15, if not higher.
Was talking all that mess
The speed was a major factor
Whoa 👀 blame game huh. That never works 😅
Congratulations coach for not giving credit where it was due your time atop the BIG12 is OVER new sheriff in town GO BUFFALOES
It’s so hard to see Colorado blue when they’re really not. You can tell Deion. Conservative. Old school. Rather help Is own than illegals. Maybe he should be governor too since the current one just  . Mayor Michael B. Hancock to declare a city-wide state of emergency. Welll wellll welllll. They turning Denver into rock mountain San Fran 🏳️‍🌈
It was too hard for him to say CU did a good job. He did the blame game. They lost…
And I hope Lee Corso's ass is gettin the business. On GameDay today he sd "TCU is gonna destroy Colorado ". He sd it wit his chest too! 🤣 And a bunch of hate. Goofy! When will they learn?! Them shutting up all their naysayers made my day.
This coach is in denial lol
Ok Colorado you won now show some class keep winning.
Why did he stop running the ball at the end. Colorado couldn’t stop the run late. Terrible coaching.
He just wont admit they got beat. He low key tryn to make excuses. Talkn bout "somehow Travis Hunter managed to play every snap". Yea and say outplayed every DB and WR on my team. Still hatin! Even in defeat. Losin to Prime hurt his pride, and ego. Love it!
I will say this of TCU, Trey Sanders is special
Whatever happened, it turned into a shoot out. If you've played or coached you know that this happens. Neither team prepped with the intent of letting the other score +40. It happens. Prime won and he still talked about the problems with the special teams and defense. That's coaching, always looking be at your best, cause as the season progresses and teams get locked in, them mistakes will be more costly. All of the "coulda-woulda-shoulda" plays don't count, on either side. It was a good game. That Colorado team is dangerous, because a lot of people didn't even think they would be able to compete, so they have nothing to lose. Put that on top of the great talent they have....it's a problem. I don't think this Coach said anything wrong. He may could have included himself, as to not hurt anyone feelings.....but yeah...smh...Let's go Colorado!!
Talked straight down on his team. He needs someone to blame for being out coached.
This coach is a POS throwing his guys under the bus like this. I wouldn't be surprised if alot of them transfer on him soon.
Wow them kids need a better. Didn't even acknowledge his players 😅
Man he threw his guys under the bus in 30s smh
TCU also had the refs on their side he forgot to mention all the favorable calls they got
Texas Choke  University
Sonny has nothing to be ashamed about his team was in the game the whole time
"Travis hunter played 65 snaps and we had guys that couldn't"-TCU COACH shades his tesm
Sonny be a coach and keep it real u got out coached and the best team won. Go back to the drawing board and give your guys the credit they deserve gtfu soar loser
a coach that mostly blames his players when he lose
Coach Dykes seems to lack the emotional maturity to accept the responsibility for the teams loss and points out the mistakes of others. His inability to accept the burden of the loss speaks volumes as to what type of coach he is. I wish the players and coaches under Coach Dykes all the support in the world, because clearly Coach Dykes will not!
The only thing worse than the CU defense was the TCU secondary and Chandler Morris in the Red Zone.  Kendal Briles' offensive scheme was bland.  But the worst part about the coaching was lack of adjustment in the second half.  Both QBs telegraphed their throws and TCU never adapted to it.  Colorado consistently threw a short inside pass and TCU kept playing for the deep ball.  Rinse & Repeat.
Prime punched America in the face with the win and shaduer did something that NO hall of fame qb has ever done! Over 500 yards in debut in power 5 conference. Cerebral, precise passing, confident, composed and a leader.  God given gifts. " BUILT DIFFERENT "
Coach Sanders has a better staff than TCU. Prob a better staff than most universities.
😂😂😂 he is salty
Way to Blame the Kids Coach.
It was a great game
Blaming the players publicly is crazy. Especially as a HC
Naysayers keep doubting these Colorado players if you want. They're going to laugh all the way to a Bowl game. Your hate and doubt is the fuel to their success.  Sanders, Hunter, Edwards, Weaver, Horn and Wilkerson will be able to handle any Pac-12 opponents. We Coming! Believe! SkoBuffs!
No class
Y’all talking bout handshakes smh😅
This dude is full of excuses !
He's hurt lol
TCU is trash coaching staff should quit find another line of  work Chick Fila is hiring pee wee coaches would have done a better job. Embarrassing  500 passing yards trash .
😂😂sorry ass tcu
Is this what BIG 12 football will look like?  Scary good offenses.
Just admit it that the Colorado QB was fantastic with his decision making and accuracy.
Refuses to give credit. Cu blew them out score not as close as appears. CU made huge mistakes.
Good coach here, no excuses… and respect for opponent
Honestly that win was because of the Colorado quarterback.  He was playing at an elite level for any nfl quarterback.  Who throws like that?
STOP blaming everyone ELSE coach, without mentioning all the other issues abut how you lost as a coach, when an opposition comes into your own HOT climate, and YOUR OWN players cramp up and NOT the opposition.....that's just bad management by the coaches, for it is YOUR JOB to ensure that YOUR team are ready....so stop BLAMING everyone ELSE.....because the TRUTH is, the buck stops with YOU... Don't be jealous just because you were out coached by a BLACK man....for Jesus too is a BROWN man....yet he LOVES BOTH WHITE and BLACK men....for he is already here....
He still confused and stunned.
You got your ass whopped lol!
coach disrespected Trey  Sanders , he had a good game today
Honestly I thought the Michael Irvin speech motivated the Buffs and that they wasn't back down or be afraid they made FOX rating go up. The Frogs fought it is passion the Buffs had. They  wanted the win more
What a coach foe blaming his players than blaming his preparation.  Good luck getting recruits!
Second place team from last season just got beat by a completely rebuilt team with players playin both sides.  Do you believe?
Excuses, excuses. CU missed a field goal,and dropped a ball that would have been a TD. CU played as a team,TCU played with arrogance that CU didnt belong on the same field....
DUDE BLAMED EVERYONE BUT HIMSELF😆😆😆😆🤦🏾🕷
If Travis doesn’t drop that long touchdown you are are down 21-0 and the game gets out of hand.
I kike this coach's honesty and  him letting us know who didn't perform well. I would like him much more if he took a little of the blame as well.
Disappointing response from the TCU coach. He really downed his own players. They played a hell of game man! That was close and it came down to last minutes. They weren't flat! There were highlights every where.
He's making excuses and he's not giving Coach Prime credit!! 😮😮
I think TCU played a great game. Mistakes were made on both sides, but TCU played hard. Those boys deserve credit for their hard work. You can’t always win every game.  You just got beat. Continue to encourage your players though.  First thing out of my mouth would have been, my guys played a tough game and they worked hard…. They should be praised.
A team is a strong as the weakest link.. The Coach
Colorado is going to show this interview at practice Monday 🤣
Guy managed to blame everyone else (including their athletic trainer) except himself.
"SO HOW TRAVIS HUNTER MANAGED TO PLAY EVERY SNAP... & WE HAD GUYS THAT COULDN'T" 😮😮😮 #12
Y'all didn't believe in that black coach so he made an example of you... for others to not play with him like a sacrifice
Wow. Honest responses. In your face. Lots of respect for the brutal honesty!
Travis Hunter is HIM
You know is if I didn't like cheetos so much and ate less ice cream and  spent less time on netflix I'd be in the NFL too.
Stop throwing your players under the bus. Give credit to CU and move on to the next question.
“Some how Travis managed to play every snap of the game.”   *NEWS FLASH* Travis is HIM
He MAD mad
Yt man’s mentality, throw the players under the bus😂
💜THE FACT THIS COACH WAS SO PRIDEFUL, SAYING THEY WERE GETTING TO BEAT THE BUFFS, THAT THEY DID NOT NEED TO PRACTICE THE WEEK BEFORE THIS GAME TOF IS CRAZY, THEN YOU THROW YOUR PLAYERS UNDER THE TRAIN, NOT THE BUS, AND TAKE NO REAL RESPONSIBILITY IS CRAZY. YOU GOT BEAT AND YOUR PRIDE HURT LIKE A MUG🤣🤣🤣
Saying the better team won would have been the right thing to say imo. CU answered every question and did not play a perfect game at all. It was clear they left a lot of plays out there.
Games are won and lost on mistakes!! They are the better team period!! Cut the excuses coach!!
Excuses😂
Weak leader.  Take notes son
The fact that no CU players cramped up, and they didn’t gas out in the 4th, says a ton about their Conditioning Coach/program.
Deion has done a great job. Hes  corny as hell with his entrance music for the initial team introduction in Colorado. He was a bush league rookie coach in the manner of which he booted most of the players when he took over (not because he did it, but the way he did it).  All that being said, he is going to ball out in that conference. He has them fired up, ready, and able. I tip my hat to the results
Just admit, CU was the better team!
Tough loss today but I'm sure coach Dykes will rally the troops and have the guys ready to play and win next game. Just got a few loose ends to tie up.
Throws players understand the bus then goes on to slide the strength and conditioning coaches under there too in public. Elite coaching.
This is what happens when you think you have better players when actuality  you don't.
I live south of Fort Worth in Waco. Texas heat is for real. I thought the Buffs were going to wilt but they jocked up and finished the job. Im a Bama fan and I’m pretty excited to see what this Prime team might develop into. Football is a great game and I like to see it played at a high level.
Awful play calling smh why are you throwing at Travis so much, why did you stop running the so early and then late you tried to run it after giving that d-line a breather smh y’all beat yourselves and didn’t match the intensity smh you got beat by a 20 point dog smh
You were out played, hands down…if “if” was a 5th that whole TCU coaching stuff would be drunk af lol
I hoped TCU was a program that was rising to the elite  of college football , where they lacked in talent they would make up in heart , execution , and culture……FRAUDS
Both teams played well and were very competent... The game could've went either way with a 3 point difference... They seem to be pretty much on the same playing level... Shedeur Sanders stated that it wasn't any different from playing against any of the teams they played against at the SWAC/MEAC HBCU FCS level... Only difference is that they were playing at the P5 level, with more players on the field... Shedeur Sanders and Travis Hunter broke some records at CU, during this game...
This is not the DOORMAT TEAM😊
Wow- blaming the kicker for missing a 42 yard field goal???  You sure you dont want to talk about your defense?
3:17 Typical hatin' reporter trying to start some racial shit about why there wasn't a "pre-game handshake" ("was there a pre-game handshake or did we miss that?" lol).     As Dykes told him, PLENTY of coaches don't do pre-game handshakes...none is required and each coach has his own pre-game routine.  Guarantee this same white reporter never asked any other coach before about a  pre-game handshake - this is his first time bringing this meaningless subject up.  A classic racial innuendo move. Geez.
He threw his players under the bus and did not take any responsibility for their coaching staff not preparing them better..
Excuses!
Without Shedeur Sanders, Travis Hunter & Dylan Edwards, it would have been a totally different outcome... This was a very close game that could've went either way... These two teams were neck and neck (Big 12 TCU & PAC 12 CU) and are on the same playing level... Shedeur & Travis got their college playing time at JSU to become some of the best college FB players playing some very competitive teams in the SWAC & MEAC at HBCUs, prior to coming to CU, from JSU where it all started for them and Deion Sanders...
Give travis his flowers Coach! 😂💯
65-7 and now a humiliating lost to a group of HBCU / transfer portal team. Sonny, start looking for a new job. I think Temple might need a new coach.
You and your d-cord should be fired! Your team did not look ready, I can't believe how far off your damn db's were playing off CU wrestling- even in the red zone you idiot! Clearly you did not watch any golm on Shadeur to ser when pressured/ blitz, he falls apart! You pressured him twice with CU having a horrible line, you idiot! And, you had your qb continue to throw against CU's best player- Hunter - with with success! No way you should have lost this game! Why did you not run it down their throats especially in the red zone? You're a horrible coach and you allowed Prime to embarrass you at home! What a disgrace for Texas!
Preparation — They thought Buffs were weak —
Hard work beats talent everyday, when talent fails to work hard! 💯🔨
This really just proves how overrated Michigan was last year also 😂😂😂
He’s just razzled😂😂
I hear a coach in denial. Blaming his QB and kicker for the loss. Both teams made mistakes, both teams left points on the field which happens a lot in the first game of the year. Tough loss no doubt but show a bit more class coach.
What he is saying is "Colorado didn't win we just lost".  Colorado doesn't deserve any credit. I wonder how he will spin their next lost which surely is going to happen.
This guy is such a sore loser lmao. The way he was talking, he was expecting a blowout lol
How the hell you going to blame the players? It is coaches fault
Terrible press conference. Own it... don't blame the kids. Give credit you took a beating and get off the stage. Whiner.
What game did this coach watch his kids played there hearts out  Wow 🤦🏿‍♂️
Ralphy stomp Ed the horne 🐸
deion is severely limited walking and people are asking why he didn't walk out for a shake, well informed "press"
He’s hating getting beat by Prime time! Lol
Would you want to play for this guy or Prime? And their lies the issue with his success. Push guys like this out!!!!!
If we did this,if if if.
“They did exactly what we thought they'd do.” - you were out-coached. “They had a hard time running the ball.” - Not according to the stat sheet coach. Just take it on the chin and stop making excuses.
You got beat by a better team
Sonny Dykes ain’t Him.
😅😅😅😅😅😂😂😂
Soooo essentially you were outplayed in every facet of the game…”if we make a field goal and don't throw two red zone interceptions its probably a different outcome.” No, you underestimated your opponent and you lost. Trav makes that second pick and Jimmy catches that deep ball it's a blowout. “We weren't prepared like we thought we were. We came our flat” aka you underestimated the buffs. No big deal…next!
I would enter the transfer portal after hearing this as a player
Travis Hunter played every snap on both side of the ball!? His strength and conditioning is insane! If he plays like this every game that Hesiman is in a 🎒!!!
They played their tails off "BUT" ... smh
*PRIME TIME BABY*
Sonny - don't act like that. The Buffs dropped dinner sure catches that would have put y'all away early. All of Shedur's passes were on the money. You should have took the high road and just said "they whipped us" versus blaming your players.
Is he serious
Actually, you should have loss by 3tds.  They just fair out beat yall ass!!!!
Amazing coach blame it on your players. No wonder tcu players was coming up to coach prime after the game.
I understand why he's pissed, but I think he's being to hard on himself. Colorado is just better.
More excited to play. Translation, out coached
That was brutal to listen to😂😂😂😂😂😂. If not for that early fumble by D. Ewaerds and some early droped passes this is a blowout
Your suppose to eat the blame, not the players . Your the coach,  you are responsible for prep you clearly were out coached .
Strength and conditioning plus nutrition 💪🏾 Colorado Buffaloes is the blueprint for how it's done 👍🏾🖤🧡🦬
I wouldn't want to play for this clown, put all of the blame on his players, he was clearly out coached  by Deon being paid millions and blaming his players, sour grapes, how about saying congratulations to coach prime sore loser!
Sour Grapes.  Sorry SOB.
If they didn’t fumble or have a lot of offside penalties it wouldn’t be close
Blame it all on the players 🤦🏿‍♂️ poor coaching
After a humiliating loss in the national championship game, TCU gets humiliated again! This time at home against a one win team from last year and players who just learned they CU system. Defense was non existent. Do they even have schemes and coverages on defense. They will be a bottom feeder this year. Maybe 2-3 wins.
CU Buffs dominated the entire game...SKO Buffs❤💯🙏🏾🖤💛🏈🏆🌟✨🌟
SO we looking for shaking hands
Sometimes the luck runs out Sonny.  He isn't playing with Patterson's players this year and the run is over.
Black excellence ✊🏾🖤 Keep dominating Coach Prime
You were out played and out coached plain and simple prime had assembled the Avengers of the CFB coaching 🤣
Honestly TCU gonna win tha division
Loaded with talent
Cu showed up
He looks flush Dykes was very scared 😳 but he did the best he could
