Why did mojang remove the farlands. It is a nice glitch, I mean seriously, how is going to walk out 12 millions blocks and not have a nice space, and it is a nice surprise once you do, although the stutter is bad(when you walk out that far), they should have at least kept the farlands itself, now we have a boring world border.
1:51  that is a donkey you Dum Dum
Wait 2 dimensions 1 overworld =600M
The actual distance is 180,000 m(m) according to the Pythagorean Theorem

5:58 wrong way 😂😂😂😂
I didn't even know they added world borders back in.  Also, if you were to put the portal from the nether outside the world border, would you appear outside or would it default into inside the border?
I think it’s Mesa biome
🤓☝️ its 1 block in the nether is i blocks in the overworld
Bro's hindi💀full sanskari 😅

Horse number seven feels.. Almost as if it a donkey
It is supposed to be 1 block in the nether = 8 blocks in the earth
No You said the wrong thing

11:47 that is literally normal on a Aternos server (both the sun and the food)
Try to do the op horse in 3d shareware
achly 1 block in the never is 8 blocks in the over world.
THAT'S A DONKEY
Bro said lucky horse number seven when he was literally a donkey😂😂
Spoiler: he loses the bet
1:54 bro thats a donkey they slow
Ur so messed up u did not have to kill the horse...
It’s lockdownlife his weird
Technicaly, if you spend enough time on it, you can get a horse that will get you to the eorld border in under an hour. (Again, technicaly. And only if you have enough time and patience in breeding good speedy horses)
u entered creative when you fell into the room of zombie so its not in hardcore like the title says bro
12:33 it’s not even Minecraft
The garlands were better 😢
One block in the overworld equals eight blocks in the nether😅
😅😅🎉🎉
Not over 14, it’s over 15
5:55 1 block in nether mean 8 in overworld i know is mistake but i want to coment bruh😅😅

Why hardcore why not just a regular one where you can respawn
Face reveal
17:20 I ACTUALLY GUESSES BADLANDS (that’s mesa biome)
Why did I mistake you with kolanii?
You can speed potion the horses then breed them and the baby retains the speed PERMANENTLY and you can keep doing it with the horses to get fast horses
1:49 why did you ride a donkey?
I missed watching lockdownlife
Haha I’m in danger
The banner looks like geometry dash

D R A W.  M E (im creepy to kill someone)
Bro, why is nobody talking about the title says hardcore and he was in creative
According to my calculation in the hoarse method it should take 154.8 hours
2:07 is an example of selective breeding to get a desired trait 🤓🤓🤓(I learned this in school)
1:48 that’s a donkey😂
13:10 Zed💀
Maybe you should collect a Block from each corner an put it on display
bro 7 is a donkey
Bro said 1 block in the overworld is 8 blocks in the nether but its the other way
“No horses were harmed in the making of this video”.

And don't say oh my God becuase ur using Gods name in vain and dont say holy moly its bad🎉❤🎉Romans 1:20 states that God's invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature, are clearly seen through the things that have been made, leaving people without excuse. This verse suggests that the existence and nature of God are evident in the natural world, providing a basis for understanding his reality. God bless to everyone Jesus died for all of u guys he cares for u he will help u no matter what he help u by changing u not the situation go repent to him❤Acts 3:15. “You killed the author of life, but God raised Him from the dead❤Luke 10:18, Jesus states, "I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven Acts 3:15. “You killed the author of life, but God raised Him from the dead GOD BLESS U ALL 🎉 JESUS CHRIST DIED ON THE CROSS FOR YOU HE DEAFEATED DEATH HE DEFEATED SIN HE ROSE FROM THE DEAD.

John 8:44, which states, "You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies."🎉🎉 And don't say oh my God becuase ur using Gods name in vain and dont say holy moly its bad and when saying God make it capital G so you respect God himself and Jesus❤Acts 3:15. “You killed the author of life, but God raised Him from the deadIn John 14:1-4, Jesus comforts his disciples, assuring them that their hearts should not be troubled. He states that his Father's house has many rooms, and he is going there to prepare a place for them. He promises to return and take them to be with him, so that they may be where he is. Finally, he assures them that they know the way where he is going🎉❤🎉
Ummm i tried to find for it in the comments and in the caption, but I didn’t find anything what made him not use elytra, and only use horses
4:59 I'm in danger It got me rolling
4:40 of course the horse is black
Bro that's a donkey not a horse😅😅
5:04 yea he 250% fine
My guess was taiga
Of 16 years of playing Minecraft, I’m still concerned about the sound horses make when they die
BTW Bedrock edition doesn’t have any world border
You forgot to visit the corners on the top of the Minecraft world
The player who wants to try it but he realizes he plays in bedrock: 💀
1:51 Yeah, that’s a DONKEY

YAY a horse went passed the limit
Yay you have a 14 fast horse All of those horses you killed will get revenge
Why did you just kill a newly born horse / pony
Finnaly you breed horses that is a good thing
Why do you have to show animal abuse 😡😡😡😭😭😭
I HATE IT WHEN YOU BURN HORSES WHAT DID THE HORSE DO TO YOU 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
😡😡😡😡😡
And you have to kill every horse now!!!
WHY DID YOU PUT THE HORSE IN THE LAVA AGAIN  MAYBE YOU CAN JUST PUT THEM IN A PEN
WHY YOU PUT THE HOUSE IN THE LAVA
Why you push the horse in the lava  YOU DO ANIMAL ABUSE
0:23 WHY I HATE THAT YOU MONSTER THE HORSE DIDN'T DESERVE THAT 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

The easiest thing would be to transfer the secret horse from the 3d shareware
You can I use the wither rose for black dye
Hahaha im in danger oof 😂😂😂

Please can you make a face reveal please lock down life, please
BRO?! 299999999999?!😂😂😂
5:58 1 block in the nether is 8 blocks in the overworld, not 1 overworld = 8 nether
7:05 put shulker Boxes inside of shulker boxes lol
I thought one block in the nether = eight blocks in the overworld 😭

3,5
Opppppppppp to you
If LockDownLife didn’t forget about tht god horse from Minecraft 3D Shareware (by entering the command “howdoyouturnthison”), which actually goes faster than an elytra, he wouldnt have lost the bet to GamerZ
Wdym 1 block in the overworld is 8 blocked in the nether 5:57
0:27 The actual fastest horse is when you go to 3d shareware and type : howdoyouturnthison. you can get the faster horse ever. Edit: it can also jump higher
You can just get a mule by breeding a horse and donkey cuz it’ll be pretty fast and you can also store the stuff you needed to do this vid
1:48 donkey
That was a donkey 😭
Just get the god horse 💀
You are epic
5:39 FULL SET?????
20:57 The moment you realize you are stuck in the world corner:

since one block in nether is 7 blocks in normal world that means you didnt travel 200,000,000 blocks, you travelled only 28,500,000 blocks, CLICKBAIT ALERT
If one block in the overworld equals 8 blocks in the nether HOW the Hell do you get 120 blocks per second btw your math aint mathing

Elite clockwoman i have a theory about who might be under the big bin 🤔    First thing it's definitely a clock man and it was like a titan clock sound and also we know that every clockman has yellow power and red is the color of the enemy everytime so I think it might be a evil version of titan clockman   I hope you like my theory
How did you get zombie spawn eggs

1 block in the nether = 8 blocks in the overworld* 6:00

i had a friend his horse was 19 blocks per second i dont know if its a glitch or what
You could get the REALLY fastest horse from a old version
I found a car that my mom was looking and had 400k miles i calculated and that’s 39 times around the world
The math is if you got to the corner you simply take longer to get to the world border because if you go to the corner means you are in the corner of a huge circle and would take like 200h to get to the corner world border...
BRO call donkey a horse GHHAHAHAHA
Donkey
20:45 :)
When breeding you should’ve done the trick where you splash horses with speed then breed them right after and they will breed a faster horse
Bro this Reminds me of bacon
Population of Minecraft Horses after this video: 📉
you can get a horse faster than anything (idk the version to get it) so it could be easier
Bro your mind is dumb cuz you can just use minecraft 3d shareware and type howdoyoureturn and get a fastest horse in the world of minecraft
1 block in the overworld equals 8 blocks in the nether as he says
Roses are red violets are blue i liked my own comment because you told me not to
...
+14=15
Yeah 😂
How did got to the above the nether they have bedrock
Poor horses
HORSE NUMBER SEVEN IS NOT AN HORSE ITS AN DONKEY
1block nether = 8 blocks in over world u get it wrong😂
He couldve got the god horse
Bro in second corner i said mesa biome and it was mesa biome...
So dark but funny lol 0:57
O 0:00 0:00 0:00 0:00 0:00 0:00 0:00 0:00 0:00  9:00 0:00 0:00 0:00 0:00 0:00
That's backwards. One block in the nether is 8 blocks in the over world. If 1 block in the over world was 8 blocks in the nether that would mean the nether is slower
Ij
With potions and breeding at the same time you can get a god horse
No animals was hurt in this video
5:58 mistake
6:05 mistake
I will
ive spawned next to the border.
You should’ve changed the version to the 3d shareware April fools update, and type a secret code in chat to get a really fast horse. Just make sure you don’t jump

Why did he have to kill the horse 😢😢
bro. I gave a horse a saddle and forgot to take it and then i kill the horse. And i didnt get the saddle. FU-
1:49… that’s not a horse that’s a donkey….
no its the other way travoling 1 block in nether = 8 blocks in overworld
Well could have just went to the infinite dimension snapshot and got the god horse
20:55 gamerz? (moment of realization) NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
1:49 that's not even a horse 😂😂
Ah, “one block in the overworld equals eight block in the nether” dude u got to be kidding with me. Doesn’t that mean it’s better to travel in the overworld?💀💀

What Google said: One block in the nether equals 8 blocks in the overworld What LockDownLife said: One block in the overworld equals 8 blocks in the nether Me:🤦 He got it mixed up! Edit: I’m wrong because if 1 block=8 blocks then 8 blocks= 1 block. Sorry LockDownLife I thought you were saying things wrong!😅 Edit 2: I just read a comment that said the same thing I did before so I might be right
Lockdownlife learn how to water bucket clutch
I saw u in creative
M
Use a pig cannon you can shoot yourself 30 million blocks doing taht
We would like you to do a face reveal

No horses were harmed in the making of this vide- [DEMONITIZED]
Hey Lockdown, did you know that you can copy banners and their patterns by putting the dyed banner in a crafting table with a blank banner with the same base color.
Fun fact: if u add swiftness on a horse and breed it, its offspring will have the swiftness effect or as fast as that.

Foreshadowing is a narrative device in which a storyteller gives an advance hint of what is to come later in the story. Foreshadowing often appears at the beginning of a story, and it helps develop or subvert the audience's expectations about upcoming events.[1][2]   In the Book of Genesis, Joseph dreams of his brothers' grain bundles bowing to his own.  Later on, when Joseph becomes vizier of Egypt, his brothers bow to him as hinted by the dream. The writer may implement foreshadowing in many different ways such as character dialogues, plot events, and changes in setting. Even the title of a work or a chapter can act as a clue that suggests what is going to happen. Foreshadowing in fiction creates an atmosphere of suspense in a story so that the readers are interested and want to know more.

Tutorial on the bps tester?
I think you can effect potions on horses and then breed then. Im not sure if is a bedrock only thing, but there you can keep the potions status of the horses on the little ones
Anyone notice he mistakly said 1block in overworld = 8 block in nether but actully he want to say 1block in nther= 8 block in overworld
Me for second corner:mesa but I doubt it will be Biome: me is mesa

@zet22
I liked my own comment.
Minecraft the far lands 12,000,000 block scary the far landsman 😨😨❗
You are in creative
bro made a gd icon💀
Idk why i calculated it, but starting from 0x 0z to every single corner and then back to 0x 0z in a week you need the speed of at least of ~54.74 blocks per second in the nether.
You really miscalculated. 1 block in the nether is 8 blocks in the overworld 6:00 . It is the opposite.
Haha IAM in dan-
200,000,000 please Try again no more spawn😢
You deserve more than 1 mil. You should be on 10 mil. What the cow is YouTube doing!?
7:45
just use elytra
Horse is 19 speed per second Horse
I hope hes safe from vegans
Really cool video but you said 1 over world block = 8 nether blocks. Isn't it the other way around? Still 10/10
1:50 normal it is a 🫏

Lockdown the problem is i just did the maths and you walk at 200,000,000 blocks over 10 months so that could take almost a year
I’m confused, you went centre to corner back to centre then magically back to the 1st corner then to the 2nd from the first.
5:57 you messed that up 😂😂 its good tho🎉❤

😊😊
If you ever fail a challenge don’t be ashamed you’re a great person
Is it called th horse speed measuring machine 5000 because it makes the horse have 5000 speed?
to make it faster first use a boost potion and keep on breeding them and keep on doing that.
If you get a donkey and horse breed the thing they breed will go faster

Project zorgo is watching
Why does no one know about power 3 rockets
Bro 1 block in neather is 8 blocks in overworld
it would be cool if you collected all the extreme corner blocks and showcased it somewhere
He was in  creative mode
If you give them potions that make them run faster and jump higher and then breed them while they have the effects, the baby will have those effects too, but permanently
Can you go to the final form of the farlands wich is beyond the world border and the regular farlands and if you do that buy a new pc after you do it beacuse it will be very laggy and probably blow up💥
😢
It's a mesa byom
If you travel 500 million blocks do it

Bro is in creative
Forest biome😊
you know that if you give the horses speed 2 then breed them they can be up to infinite blocks a second
12500km = 12500000blocks You travel 200000km
This Girl is a 1:25
You can put speed potions on

Bro flew 200m meters
one block in the nether = eight blocks in the overworld*
Nooooooo ! 😂
Horse number 7 is a donkey
past the  border😄😁🏅🕶
If you give 2 horses speed potions and then breed them they will get faster
If u splash a horse with a speed potion and breed it with another horse with the same effect, then the baby will have the effect permanently and if u do it again it will be faster. Also works with jump boosts
He called a donkey as a horse
BRO LEGIT FAILED CAUSE HE WAS AFK
🎃🎃🎃🎄🎄🎉🎉🎉🎉🚮🚭🚭🚭🚭🚭🚭🚭🚭🚭🚭🚭
18:20 mending + xp farm left the chat
Why do you put a random numbers on those machines?
Just asking why u need a horse when you hame a elytra
Legends notice horse number 7 is donkey
And the speed of light can travel around the earth 7 times in 1 second😐
╏ ” ⊚ ͟ʖ ⊚ ” ╏
Bro he said 1  block in the overworld is 8 block in the nether its the opposite but i not a hater keep trying:) Edit: didn't read his comment lol
Hey lockdownlife did you onow if you breed 2 horses with the speed effect their child will have the same speed as them even without the effect. Note: this only works on bedrock
Hi MY name is mansoor try sind 666= cross
Dude you I could do hardcore if I had java I only have bedrock could I join you if possible
Minecraft  king
He killed a donkey in the beginning not a horse
200,000,000
You said 1 block in over world is 8 BLOCKS IN NEATHER?????? U got it the other way it's 1 block in neather is 8 blocks in over world
NO VIDEO ON LOCKDOWN CHANNEL
*"One block in the overworld is 8 blocks nether"* 💀
Bro just said 1 block in the over world equals 8 blocks in nether it's quite opposite😂😂😂
Bro I don’t need a boat machine to make by game slow down lol
That’s a donkey
Please
Do a face reaveal
ug oh ok KJV high Ohio yep proper reclaim 911 it 85=t=kih=idk 86gk8i
LockDownLife use mending on your eletra

Why can’t you just tp their
4:39 is the loading screen. 😢
5:29 The UK flag
No it one block in the neither is equal  to eight blocks in the over world 😕LOCK DOWN LIFE 😕
U killed the horses:(
If you give speed potions to horses and breed them the speed will pass down to the baby horse.
Good
I hope that’s his test world because he’s in creative for the time slow machine
Dr Golden I said to myself for cornless
🐴
You tame a donkey for the horse test￼
It is not a 1 block in the owerworld it is 8 blocks.
Hey Lockdown. I just discovered that splashing a horse with speed 2 and jump boost 2 is going to make your horse alot faster than normal
Bedrock edition horses can go so much faster  Give the horses speed potions before breeding.  The speed from the potions is applied to the offspring  They can go insanely fast
YOU TRAVELED ONLY 120,000,000blocks do the math lol
Your killling the HOURE
10:11 when ur gf sees it
it disturb me so much you didnt even made a simple calculation to know how much time would the horse method took, before of starting the travel, and wasted so much time for nothing (but clearly this video has to be fake)
How did you got back?
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤go. To. 🛌 bed.   For. YOU 😊
The seventh “horse” looks a lot like a donkey
Please, you can also find the stripe lands if you want to, and your version
Can you travel in time to find every corner of the far lands and meet that thing it’s an entity
Can you do a tutorial on the wood farm
Why birch
Insane🤯❤️
Moment of silence for all the horses who died for no reason😢
I think spruce
Request: Make a sniffer statue
Can’t believe your brother actually helped you to beat him in the bet
17:19
10:57
you have now collected elytras 3 times
6:38 yeah, I used a very intelligent method (called a calculator) to see how many blocks it would take to travel two hundred million blocks in the over world in the nether, and it turns out you would need to travel *Twenty-five million blocks* in the nether to travel to the world border in the over world.
##
I got 2B blocks traveled
Bro LockDownLife is really forced to make that builds why y don't sub??
I thought it was a spruce biom
My name is zed. I'm so confused why you said my name at 13:00 and you said my name again at 16:44 and at 18:37
This mans voice sound younger than 2 yr ago how!
I dislike because miscounting
😮😮😮😮😮OMG
How do you get home at the end of the video?
I hop you realize that 132 hours is more than five days
Instead of making a lag machine, buy a shittier pc
8 was an donkey
U can make horses offspring faster by using a splash potion of speed and/or jump boost on the two parents then breeding them, their offspring is faster and/or can jump higher.
U could actually had use the potion technique which uses 5 of leaping 2 and 5 of swiftness 3 . Put one of each on parent and breed them then get 2 kids of them and breed Them like that do it 5 times than u Can get  an overpowered horse
PACMAN!!!! 0:08
MESA
Omg I actually guessed the biome correctly😂
Yea definitely 1 block in the over world is 8 blocks in the nether
Bro said 1Block in overworld is 8 in the nether in stead of 1Block in nether is 8 in Overworld 😂😂😂😅😅😂
5:58  * math has left the chat *
👻
Can I just mention that you can breed horses with speed and jump potions that should make a horse with permanent speed and jump boost
ive gotta say man i got really excited when i found all the awesome content that you post which is way better than any other i can find (im not even kidding)
NO WAY I JUST GUESSED CORNER NUMBER 2'S BIOME, I WAS LIKE "I feel like it'll be a Mesa Biome" (deym)
“One block in the over world = 8 blocks in the nether” kinda wrong yk
Put a speed or jump boost potion to make horses faster
Wonder how speed 2 would work with that 14+ BPS horse
Well idk it seems like you used tick speed but idk
"one block in overworld is 8 block in the nether" intresting
HOW 🤔😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
Bro is holding himself💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
hi
Badlands
Is no one gonna talk about how many horses this man has killed
"NooOooOooOoO"
I think snow biome
Hey pro tip get fast horse (doesn't have to be fast) throw a speed potion on it and keep breeding and breeding for like 10 times and he will be zooming
where did tou get that emerald blocks bro😭
I think if lock down life didn't spend his time on finding the fastest horse he would've won the bet
An easy way is teleporting
Yo😂😂😂😂
Yp
number  8 is a donkey
ur wrong, 8 blocks in the OVERWORLD is1 block in the NETHER
What you do for living  Him: killing horse 😊
Don’t say omg
I can imagine this man trapping a wither and warden alive in a cage and has them as a pet
Wow that is Sooooooo long!
Rip all horse who died in this video
he coulve spalshed them with swiftness and then breed them to keep the effects permenent
Imagine brother😊
You said you made the whole thing in hardcore I saw you had no hearts and hunger you went and creative
U said something wrong 1 block in the NETHER is 8 blocks in the over world
the max speed for a horse is 14.23 blocks per second.
6:00 Wrong, it is the opposite 1 block in the nether is 8 in the overworld
4:58 I AM DANGER * skull *
When you did the Minecraft planits for the end you failed you forgot to do the forgotin Planit plodo
If you used speed pots on that horse it could’ve been enough probably
The ending😂
at the last corner the y was 69 lol
The hores go's 20 blocks pr second
No I know how to get 10 time fast  it is glich
How about make biggest map
Your
Ty
Try for sacrificing your eye s and arms and hands for our intertainment we love you content pls make more we will support you every video ;)
5:57 "Because 1 block in the overworld is equal to 8 blocks in the nether"
Bro actually killed more then 20 horses, you didn't need to kill them!
K b b b b bxkXx Z X X
horse color said everyone that "im the fastest" 💀
Actually 1 block in the nether is 8 blocks in the overworld
FUN FACT   if you are trying to get the fastest horse then find two random ones and give them both speed. The baby horse will keep that speed meaning you can do this process many many times ( with any potion effect ) and you can get the most overpowered animals
Badlands biome
congradulaitions for 1 million to you lockdownlife
lockdownlife upload more vidio
I guess correctly!
Your pc won’t crash but these adds will crash it 14:20
Why did there stand axis
Mules are faster then donkeys and horses but to get it you need to breed an horse to an donkey
20:08 I need to know that music!
Shoulda use the totem pop stasis to do it solo
Bro imagine if theres a new update and the chunks
Good tip for breeding horses: You need the best speed potion and throw it at the two horses your breeding i recommend using golden apples or golden carrots
Oh you meet him too I met him on titan raid that I made and he joined 👍
Why didn't you use the elytra?
i have a suggestion can u make a video where u collect every rare items pls notice im sub
It's a donkey that's why
HE WENT IN CRATIVE MODE 8:04 !
5:57 bruh
You did not need to get all those elytras and unbreaking books just put mending on 1
He could just use his elitra
Its a donkey. What do u expect they are pretty slow
I'm pretty sure bro wasted time by flying up 100k blocks like 4 times
Bro u can do it with ender pearls in neither
did noone relized that he said”1 block in the overworld=8 block in the nether”
6:01  1 block in nether equals 8 block in overworld* thats lil mistake
I’m back
Animal abuse
Speed potions: allow us to introduce ourselves.

Story about horse story That day lock is testing who the faster  The faster Will live the Slowed Will die A so much horse die and again and again and again  And 1 day lock got the fastest and the rest Will die  And the fastest die to or keep ✨
Bro you can throw a speed 2 potion at the horse and bree the horse and baby horse will have the permanent affect and you can do it over and over again so you can make a really fast horse
horse seven was a donky why you gotta be like that
I want to say thank you for entertaining me while I was on a plane! 😂  I love your content  -Luke Bowen   Edit: MOM IM FAMOUS
Skeleton horses are always fast
It’s actually the other way around :) 5:54
6:00 Bruh it's 1 block in the nether = right blocks in the over world!
now do it all in the nether
5:55 its the other way around, my guy😂
Can you try surround world with stone blocks or other blocks?
It’s called elytra
Bro he told that 1block in the overworld = 8 blocks in the nether!!
I think in 9:48 I saw your allay planet
What's his PC specs??? My would lag so much even if I go to 4000 blocks away
I like how he tested a donkey
Bro I had a trick for you:-  (If u apply this trick u can literally get a flash in vanilla minecraft) Step 1:- get 4 horses of any speed. Step 2:- put 2 horses in one cage and the other in another cage. Step 3:- get some golden carrots and throwable speed potions. Step 4:- throw one speed potion on 2 horses in a cage and then breed them, do same with the other 2 horses. Step 4:- you will get the child of the horses that will run much faster than the parent horses. And now if u will do this multiple times with speed 2 potions, it will increase the horses speed every time you breed those.  (Note:- Make sure to breed the children of the horses not the elder horses or it will not work)
Why didnt he just breed the fast horses 💀
try to get 100 obsidian without netherite items
Ummmmm.............. , What 🤣 to the floor in the same the
😊love all your vidsss
Bro really called the donkey a horse☠️
You know you can apply potion effects to horses than breed them the baby will have the effect forever
Bro 1 block is not 8 blocks in the nether, it's the opposite😅
5:58 it's the opposite lol
8:05 bro just get the rtx 4080 out and spawn one zombie
For the horses, you could just download a mod that show horse speed
Gamerz? NNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO -lockdownlife
no horse is harmed in making of this video😊
You can actually duplicate banners if you didnt know if you use the banner color u used to make the banner you made put them together and u should get another one
Poor horse 😢
Put a potion if speed 2 on them and breed them before the effect runs out
6:00 emm 1 nether block is 😊
"make that part about the bet -            animation 4"

Lockdown life in 1.14 there is a doop glich
This  is  fake  i  mean    how   did  he  go through  the  bedrock   and  how  is  able   to  place  blocks  on  the  nether  roof
And it stacks to 150
If u breed a horse w speed its perm for the baby
There's a  glitch that makes speed 2 perm
You did not have to kill the horses i unsubed and disliked 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Time to look above the border
6:00 i think you got it wrong mate !
Horse no 8 was a donkey

Correction: 1 block in the nether equals 8 blocks in the overworld. 😉
You should have used the flight duration 3 rocket , this would made your journey so much faster
Brct
5:53 accually 1 block in the nether = 8 blocks in the over world.. You've mistaken
5:59 it’s swaped
brings me back to my horse experimenting days
5:58 sry but you got it backwards, I know you didn’t mean it tho
Your are evill
Honestly, i have mixed feelings about this video. I think this video is fake, but i am not 100% sure. it has a weird vibe to it, because you didn't instantly go search for elytras(which imo should be completely obvious) and the math doesn't really add up. if this is really legit, then i have to say: mad respect for doing something like this just for a bet. Maybe you can do some explaining, but i cannot prove or disprove that this video is fake.
you couldve used the trident method
Camels are better because they can dash too 12 blocks and are faster
HELLO
o_o
Why didnt u just use power level 3 fireworks
If you breed two horses with swiftness effect the baby is faster
you mean 1 block in the Nether is 8 blocks in the over world💀
I think you ment to say 1 block in the nether is 8 blocks in the over world
Can you pass me your texture pack?
Actually you can splash an speed potion to make a horse crazy fast
Yuo murder horses
I like your videos
Imagine to reach the end of Minecraft world border but in End and Neather
Are you serial right now just write down the chords back home I don't know how to spell chords Hope I spelled it right Tell me lockdown Life😊
OMGMGMGM I ACTUALY GUESSED THE 2 CORNER4S BIOME WHAT THE EHEHEHEHELLLL
When he make a mistake 6:00
of corse the horse was black and it could run the fastest
Why you don't use spash potion of speed
😅😊😅😂😂😂😂
so you can make a VERY fast horse if you breed them it’s jump boost and it stacks infendetly
I swear this had a different title this morning 🤨
It’s faster on the nether
Should've user maps to save the corners
What if you found every corner in the 3d of the world instead 2d
15 horse speed is impossible the max is 14.23
Fake but update Carla ending
why you not use speed potion on horse and breed and do it again?
I thought it was 1 block in the nether is 8 blocks in the over world
I got it right it was a masa biome thats what i guessed it will be 😮🥳🥳
I like how it’s not hardcore
You could give horses speed and bread 2 speed potioned horses andd the baby will keep the effect and if u reapeat, you can make a super fast horse
8:08 Caught cheating
4:30 fastest horse
1:22 😂
Give them potions and breed them they will have permament effects also i mean the horses
Actually, you can splash speed potion on the horses then breed them, after that you can actually get infinite speed
You said 1 Block in overworld is in nehter 8 Blocks but is 1 Block in nehter is 8 Blocks in overworld
How about creative mode
😊minecraft is the best
Me and my friends found a horse That is fast like it Can go 20 Blocks in like 1 sek
4:13 should have used speed it transfers over to baby and it can stack
Bread horses with speed II effect
Lock can you build a hat for the capybara that says c
bro said 1 block in overworld is 8 blocks in the nether💀
6:01 one block in the "overworld" is equal to 8 blocks in the nether???? its supposed to be the other way around
Um do you mean one block in the nether roof is equal to 8 blocks in your world if not there's no reason why you go to the nether roof
Uh, YOU DONT NEED TO KILL HORSES, so basically you get 2 horses, and splash them with speed potions, then breed them, then the baby has speed forever, you can repeat this process to get faster and faster horses, and also apparently spotted horses are the fastest, and you can use tape to hold down a key
Can you make a video that you dig a massive hole in the ground and leave the ores and put glas in the air between the ores so it looks like your x-raying? Please i subscribed.
Can't wat until you update your world...
yea sb737 is a good youtuber
5:58 it's 1 block in the nether = 8 blocks in the overworld
Hey lockdown life if you don't build a giant diamond beacon You have to show me your face reveal all of us Not really joking.
GUYS THERE IS SOMETHING THAT I NOTICED THAT IN THIS MOMENT HE SAID HARDCORE WORLD BUT HE'S CREATIVE MODEEEE.   ‏‪8:41‬‏
Wow
‘That’s like flying the earth 5 times’ Light: pleb.
200,000,000 blocks?!
Just use your elytra
Horse 7 was a donkey (i thinks?)
Why not just do horse glitch? Just breed horse with speed both of them need speed and it will make a faster horse
1block in nether = 8blocks in overworld
Yes
6.00
One block in nether is 8 blocks in over world
Are you Australian
what's that sound at 2:16? It sounds so familiar
Tip: throw a speed potion at two parent horse and breed them they'll create a baby that is super fast and when you make it an adult they'll be SUPER SUPER fast
WoW good flex 8:23
throw swiftness onto the horses when breeding and they will become crazy fast
Elyrta 😢😢
make a god horse with over 50+ blocks per second or 30+ blocks per second
Can we appreciate how he says "1 block in the "overworld" equals 8 blocks in the "nether" ? Fun Facts. (More like reverse.) You should take some rest lockdownlife you are doing great videos to entertain us but you should take some rest. We don't mind you taking leave to restore your sanity.
Can you give us your World to download
Very Nice video i think the bet was winable if u didnt start with horses and went straight for elytras❤
10:22 noice
4:30 wow
Noob video
Very nice video but at 5:58 its the actual opposite Gg tho
Why can't you do it in creative mode? Lockdown life
I can’t see your other videos if some are posted
5:59 Bro said it backwards. 💀💀💀
21:01 LockDownLife Screams at the end
The one that made it through the entire speed testing machine  that one has a one and a 8000 chance of happening
Next he’s gonna go to the end gap
OMG I ACTUALLY GUESSED THE SECOND CORNERS BIOME LET'S GOO !!!!!!
Hi
0:08 PAC-MAN?!?!?!
5:59 wrong It is the opposite
You can put speed on a horse and then breed it the horse than gets parmenent speed
As captain from game toons would say, "So, Op!"
Gamerz afk at the end 💀
You have a allytra just use that
I think the biome is going to be a birch biome
Best video ever
One block in overworld is 8 block in nether 💀
Honestly, lock down life I love how much work you put into each and every one  of your videos and I am one of those people who supports you. I don’t know how but mentally.

*new subscriber*
‏‪20:55‬‏ oh NOOOOO😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
No you dint got the horse like 14+ its 16
Bro... you got world record of getting as high as possible just in another project.
Isn’t this a reupload I’ve literally seen this before
I guessed first try the 2nd corner biome was a mesa omg!
1 block in the overworld is 8 blocks in the nether xd
"1 block in the overworld = 8 blocks in the nether" I think you got it wrong
What about your elytras from the other video?  Edit: shoulda finished the video 😂
Calming
If you throw speed potions on horses they will be just as fast and give the speed to there child so if you do it on two and continue doing it you will  get a 20+ block per second horse
He said 8 blocks in the nether is 1 in the over world, 1 block in the nether is 8 in the over world
5:55 its the opposite 💀
Ah yes 1 block in the over world is 8 blocks in the nether
1 block in the overworld = 8 blocks in the nether? Logic 100%
tip when you breed the horses while thwey have the speed potion affect the breeded one is faster
Tip for getting faster horses breed them when both parents have speed and the child will come out even faster the the parent edit: him its laggy me with my potato pc
Re-upload?
i bought ur poster!
Bros destoying the horse population
But bane of artropords is realy good, And is best
@lockdownlife
Man if he get all this hores in real life he will be rich
do a video where you breed a 1000 blue axolotls
y dont you put a banner in every 8 corners of your worly i mean on bedrock and build limit have fun if u do it
Upgraded all structures
bruh 1 block in the overworld equals 8 in the nether????
5:57 He meant the oposite but you understand what he means
If you breed a horse with a speed potion the baby will have the effect forever
What are you going to do when an update comes
1 block in the nether is 8 blocks in the overworld not the opposite
"No HoUrSe iS hArMeD In ThIs ViDeO"🤓
Why didn’t you just use elytras
1:55 thats a donkes
ah yes  1 block overworld= 8 blocks in nether
i recormend you to use litemtica mode for building
10:30 - 10:45 I remember this video!!!! You have done a similar video before where you travelled from border to border or something like that! This was the identical clip, I remember white shulker, the villager position, the anvil broke and the snowy place where you did that!!!
YASSS IM RIGHT MESA BIOME!!!!!😊😂😅😢😅😂😊😂😢
this is just like traveling to Thailand watching black Adams
SIUU SB😊
Umm... how do you open the shulker boxes with rockets in while in the air
6:00 its the other way around 😂 otherwise it would be slower in the nether
dont you mean one block in the nether = 8 blocks in overworld?
If you breed a horse with speed effect then you can breed a super fast hordse
"Because 1 block in the overworld equals eight blocks in the nether" 5:56
U mean one block in the nether is eight blocks in the overworld
you should use the camel
Couldn’t lockdownlife go on gamerZ computer and teleport him back like that
I almost die 🤕
Love this comment ❤
Did you notice that the black/brown are the first to pass the 14+ 😅
Can you make a tutorial of that boat spammer 3000 of how it’s named? Lol pls do a tutorial
Why did GamerZ help him win the bet that he was in
Lock down if you breed horses with speed it will make them permanently faster
"Oops i forgot to record"
You can throw speed potions at the horses and breed them and the baby will keep the buff forever (and one block in the nether is eight blocks in the overworld not the other way around)
9:17 that’s what she said
Why you not give Potion speed from your Horse
Hose number 8 is a donkey
Bro for second corner I guessed it was desert or mesa and I was correct
I like yer vids but you already went through the entire horse thing before in the last wold border episode. So pls dont fake content
Animal abuse
His channel's name is actually true
Bye❤hello❤
Tip for infinite storage… Get a shulcker box, put ender chests with shulcker boxes that have ender chests that have shulcker boxes in them and on… Fill all of you inventory with them, save 2 rows for rockets and a silk touch pickaxe… INFINITE STORAGE (YOU CAN ALSO PUT THEM IN CHESTS!!!)
isn't it 1 block in the nether=8 blocks in the overworld?
You Linda sound like morgz
Redstone is harder then math 😅 Come on you gota like this comment :) 👇
It's kind of funny that you said 1 block in the overworld equals 8 blocks and Nether
U can breed horses with the speed trade and the horse that is born will keep the trade, all you got to do is keep breeding these horses till u can go lightspeed.
1000
5:59 he said 1 block in the overworld is 8 blocks in the nether, but it's the other way around. Great video as always though! :)
This is sooooo cool

I GUSSED 2 BIOME
in 1.20, the devs said that a newborn horse should be faster than his parents
Welp time to make my gigantic moving city that I have built with create mod to move to the world border my city is 1000 blocks wide and 1500 blocks long I made it in hardcore I think I’m the first person in the world to do something so stupid bc it takes forever to build
So, you can put a speed potion on 2 horses than breed them, the new horse will have the speed effects with no timer
How could you get teleported from that remote distance.Does any of you know the trick?
BRO WHY KILL ALL THE HORSES
Fun fact he had elytra’s in a shulker box
If 1 block in the overworld is 8 blocks in the nether doesnt that mean that in the nether You travel slower?
8 blocks in the overworld is 1 block in the nether not the opposite like you said.
When you guess the correct biome.   😱
Nonononononono 1 block in the nether is 8 blocks in the overworld that means if it was the opposite it would be slower
Umm actually 1 block in the nether is 8 blocks in the over world
You should’ve taken a map and used them at each corner
Should have used the nether position glitch
Build a poo going in capybara mouth and coming out of the ass
Why does the banner look like a geometry dash thing
bro forgor he could just merge them in da crafting table
I love you. Manja
TIP, you can add shaders and very large  texture's to add extreme lag, also a laptop
I’m just saying that you got them mixed up one block in the nether equals eight blocks in the overworld
5:58 i think u got something wrong lol its 1 block in the nether is 8 blocks in the overworld but im pretty sure u misspoke
So glad you mentioned sb737, he is great!
This videos cool
Bro forgot donkeys exist🗿🗿
first of all, you missed out on a big opportunity in that title. I did the math and you didn't travel 200 million blocks, traveling to each corner from the middle of your world will make you go about 42 million blocks out in each direction, multiply that by 4, bam 169 million. Nice (edit: it comes out to 42,426,069 in the math, not just a flat 42 mil, also Nice number)   but also i just wanna complain so here it is, in reality you only traveled 21 million which is a very big number but def not 200 million, Id say if you made the distance in the overworld you could actually say 200 mil but thats obv not possible in a week
make 2 graves for jake and hopper... please it least you could do they were gone too soon :(
Elytra?
5:58 Actually, 1 block in the nether is 8 blocks in the overworld.
1:49 that’s a donkey
WOAH!
You can also use a speed potion and then mate the two horses
My reaction to that information 😐
10:12 thats what she said
Can you read 10 million
Face reveal
Bro said 1 block in overworld = 8 blocks in nethrr
1 block in the nether equals 8 blocks in the eighth word
6:00 u sure about that
5:58 its the other way around 💀 😂
corner 2 i legit it will be masa biome
i like how the first 1/3th of the video i just him playing with horses and then realizing he has just wasted his time
bro doesn't know abt the horse speed potion breeding trick
Face reveal please
You can actually make a glitch red stone circuit to glitch potions giving you speed 255 in about 2 hours and it lasts infinitely 😅😅
I did not know GamerZ is your brother
I don't even know why you didn't use an elytra in the first place
If you explore the entire overworked you won't have any new chunks for updates
5:54 𝐭𝐡𝐞 other 𝐰𝐚𝐲 𝑎𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑
I think its 1 block in the nether is 8 blocks in the overworld
Why not superbreed them don’t forget speed potion during breeding
Ofcourse the fastest horse is black
WOW
The fastest a horse can go is 14.57 meters per second or 14.57 blocks per second.
Me: maximum rate of fps 40 Youtuber: maximum rate of fps 300 above
one block in the nether = eight in the overworld you misspelled you said ´´one block in the overworld = eight in the nether
Why
Its 8 in overworld = 1 in nether
Fake
Do everyone now that if you got three horses and a speed po
I unsub Gamerz:)
you should make a house on each corner representing it's biome
You can duplicate banners in the crafting table using the patterened one and some blank ones of the same base color. Also if you named each one after the corner it was placed at and took a map of each corner it would show them on the maps. Would have been a cool thing to display somewhere.
bro is the fake pucci 💀 kind of a jojo referance
1 block in the nether 8 block in the overworld
I guess masa biome really
Good video
Lock u know that make speed 2 pot make sure that it's a splash one on 2 horse and keep breeding the 2 horse until you get a real fast
I can’t believe how much determination you put in your videos! Your storytelling is amazing!
Feather your boost stop using it all at once
so uh. you said 1 block overworld = 8 block in nether
1
Man I really thought he'd go full horse method for this one 😂
200m blocks? i cant even travel 10 blocks without crashing because my graphics card is so trash
200 million blocks traversed? In Minecraft Hardcore? I can barely make it across the room without tripping over something!
Great video as always! Also, at 5:57, I’m pretty sure 8 blocks in the overworld is equal to 1 block in the nether, and not the other way around.
he got the one block in the nether is one block in the over world wong
Its 1 block in nether 8 block in overblock
U could have won the bet if u didn't spend so much time breeding and killing horses at the start 😢
That is lideraly the same vid that you already did but to All edges
Why ypu always look for best horse and next use elytras?
Technically, you haven’t explored your entire world because probably at least 80% of all world chunks have not been loaded, meaning he hasn’t explored them
What happened to your full shucker box of elytras you used in an past video on this series?
Time to count the amount of children screaming "you should have splashed speed on the horses before breeding them!!" To clearify this is BEDROCK ONLY.
5:58 is halariously incorrect
Reminder to clean your keyboard 🤣 Great video mate!
Do you know he just wasted all his  lecherous?
One time I got a 13 or was it 11?
Nice
8:11 he was in creative??
Literally wearing an SB737 shirt right now Let’s go
I geust the second one right
i havent even made it to 1 border and you made it to 4!
5:57 Almost got it. 1 block travelled in the nether is 8 blocks in the overworld if you place a portal
You do know if you breed horses while they're affected by a swiftness potion the babies have a permanent effect so it's an exponential growth they keep increasing and increasing and increasing
NOT 🚫 IT
I enjoid and Ls be my first. Real friend
Ur smart 8:45
you said 1 overworld block equal 8 nether blocks its the other way around
What? I remember watching this, Is it a reupload?
Please make full nether items beacon just like Wadzee  & Wunba
7:22, I GUESSED THE RIGHT BIOME!
Imagine at the end he went to the wrong corner
In my survival world, my first horse was a really fast one, possibly a 12 bps
Build a big skeleton
1:15 you did not just get me like that
could have bred them with speed potions
I remembered a guy uses speed potion and breed the pig while having effect and the result is their son is faster. Idk if you can do that with horse
1 block in the nether =8 blocks in the overworld*
you are so great at minecraft
I’m so happy. I’ve watched every single one of his vids and I’m so exited there’s another one♥️♥️
Next challenge: get to the nether corner. Nearlly impossible...
I will always subscribe
I love your videos lockdown life
Btw the longer u ride   a horse the faster it goes
6:00 "1 block in the overworld equals 8 blocks in the nether" 😂😂😂😂
Stop killing horses😑😑😑😟😟👿👽 and this is you→ ☻️
Its 1block nether roof 8 blocks in overworld
0:46 How to make the machine?
777
People whose pc works the exact same way without the boat dispenser 5000 😂😂
Hi
That was a serious horse abuse😂😂
12,550,824 miles its farlands 30,000,0000 miles its World border
SB737😍
bro how dumb do u have to be to realise that horses cant take u to the world border
WOW your editing is insane!! So dedicated!! Really inspiring for me!
hey to be faster try using a rocket with flight duration 3
isnt that cheating a bit? i think it is at least it feels like cheating
Lockdown at 5:59 one block in the nether equals 8 blocks in the over world so you got it muddled up
At 8:03 he is in creative mod ??
8 blocks in overworld = 1 block in the nether
It's wrong it's 1 block in nether = 8blocks in over world
i got insanely fast horse in my creative world and named him speedy
6:00 / 21:07 He said the opposite !!
Lockdown, you said 1 block in the overworld is 8 blocks in the nether, but its the other way round. Love ur vids!
5:58 switch words pls
yoooooooooooooooooo lockdown
05:55 huh
Finally He beat his OLD WORLD RECORD
um  lockdown: "1 block in the overworld = 8 blocks in the nether"  me: "8 blocks in the overworld = 1 block in the nether  lockdown i think you messed up🤔
u mean 1 block in the nether = 8 blocks in the over world?
1:05 u try this before the 120m block
1:47 it was a donkey not a horse...
I wonder where you got this idea from 🤔
If you throw a spash postion of speed 2 on two horses and breed them the baby naturally have the potion effect if you continue it you will get a speed 200 block per second
I am amazed that you got a 17 block per second horse
you never fail to entertame me
Amazing! i don't even have the engery to play 4 hours ;) and i'm always enjoying your videos!   oh and btw, i can't find your second channel..
21:00 Lmao now you are stuck in the corner of world border lol
Did anyone else think his brother wasn’t going to push the chamber for a minute😂
You should make a new world and break every block
You put in sooo much work into this you deserve a like a sub!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I think you swapped the over world to nether ratio it’s one block in the nether is 8 block in the over world
Fun fact if you throw speed poition on a horse and breed them thier child is gonna be super speed
I like your all videos want more
Blud really said 1 block in the overworld is 8 blocks in the nether 💀💀💀
I am a kid that's just my mom on the pitce
I never knew that Gamerz was your brother
Rocket duration 3help will help
Uh didn’t he do this before?
If you get a Swiftness, potion and splash it on 2 Horses and then breathe them right after it'll make the baby go faster
There is a more easier way splash a speed potion on the 2 horses before u breed the
another simple way to teleport back to spawn from millions of blocks away with just one player is to find the nearest stronghold, set your spawn and then break the bed, and once you go through the portal you will be at world spawn
Can we just talk about the fact that he found out about the video that was released like 2 years ago 😂😂😂
It's gd face the banner
5:58 it’s the opposite but still cool video
Congrats Lockdownlife keep it up🎉🎉
how is no one talking about how 1 block in the overworld is 8 in the nether
I actually thought of the mesa biome for 2
Number 7 was a donkey
5:58 😂😂😂😂
Guess what else long?
Lockdownlife i have a suggestion pls link the music you use in ur vids in the description pls im subbed
damn thats crazy
5:59 I guess it works the other way around
Use mending on elytra simple
What is sword Band of Arthropods?
8:10 bro really said I travelled 200,000,000 blocks in Minecraft hardcore and he’s at creative
You got the netherworld overworks block comparison backwards it’s 8blocks in overworld is1 block in nether
Lock down here's a tip so if you make speed poisions and jump boost poisions they will comebind and become faster and faster so try that next time and 2 why did you not use your elytra
This makes traveling to 1 world boarder look like a cakewalk
What a great Video. I loved the idea a lot it's unique and I've never seen it before. Keep it up man. I will sub❤
4:41 he is black?🤯
Commented before a day
Why did you have to burn all the horses?
desert
Fake he was in creative
Lore of I Travelled 200,000,000 Blocks in Minecraft Hardcore! Momentum 100
I finally got a God set it only took 200 hours😢😢😢😢😢😢
I have watched every single one of your minecraft videos
Literally every time GamerZ appeared on screen i yelled STAB HIM
I think you are seriously underrated, every video you post gets more insane than the last
if u splashed 2 horses with speed you could get even faster horses
This one is similar to the other video but wheres the old speed measure for horses
Use a speed potion when breeding to get a faster horse
Speed boost the horse, then breed it!  then speed boost them and on and on! it works :3 (Unless it was patched out
you are a Minecraft GENIUS
o
4:15 The fastest horse is 14.57 blocks per second so you didn't need to try and find a faster one
5:59 i think it's vice versa
Just breed them whit the speed effect and it will have permanent speed boost
TBH i human
Wait if 1 block in overworld is 8 blocks in the nether isnt it easier if you been in overworld?
If only he didn't use horses
my man is the best at killing horses 💀
6:00 No,1 block in the nether=8 blocks in our world
But I swear I seen this vid a month ago?
POV subbed to lockdown = alive 😮 POV not subbed = dead 💀
you can also breed them with the speed effect to make them faster I think I might be wrong though (for speedy horses)
Woah
I got a good idea for a vid u should make a chicken statue and put a couple of chicken farms in there and lockdownlife plz like this comment
now travel to the world border in the nether
"One block in the overworld = 8 blocks in the nether "
I love lockdownlife he is the best youtuber in de world Lockdownlife can you pliese likbmy comment that would make my verry happy because that wuold be the first time that a youtuber liked my comment 😢  Ow and keep the good work going  Did you now i actuali live in belgium thats the reason wy my english isn’t that good  And im subscribde
I guesd maisa biome and it was right 😂😮😅
But lockdown by when is the face reveel!! 🥱👁️👄👁️
You are the best Minecraft player
Did lockdownlife actually say 1 block in the overworld is 8 blocks in the nether thats the wrong way round
Gold armor is the worst
You know I have a huge love for horses and You just ruined 1 cute moments of my life
This must be pain (>_<)
If you read a horse with a splash potion of speed The horse will be faster I think it might have been patched though I'm not 100% sure
I almost hate you for killing the horse
5:59 it’s the opposite
Make a video with sugar exploding the entire world
Anyone noticed that he said that 1 block in the overworld is 8 in nether instead of 1 block in nether is 8 in overworld😂😂😂😂
splash  speed pots on the horses what u are about to breed
What?! your brother is  gamez
now travel 500 million blocks
You can copy banners by putting an empty banner and a done banner of the same base color in the crafting table
Would it be a lockdown  Life if he didn’t kill horses.
You should have used swiftness on the parents then breeded. This would have carried the effect down to the off spring
Wait.. 1 block in overworld is 8 blocks in nether? It means that nether is way more slow than overworld
Its the other way 1 block In Nether is 8 în overworld
Lol nice
😂😂😂😂😂😂
And the 7 i love 😂😂
This is my 100 vid i seen from you
b
I put the emoji by accident im not tring to be a hater
If you splash a haste potion on the horses then breed them the haste is carried over to the breaded horse
Since you traveled that far dose that mean you can't see 1.21 in the hard core world if 1.21 gets released 😊
Horse seven was a donkey
Horse number 8 was a  donkey
How is he going to get back
5:58 isn't that supposed to be the reverse mate??
:)
I did the same horse build but make more speeds it stops at 50 then it says over speed but over 14 is for speed portioned horses
You mean one block in the nether equals eight blocks in the overworld
u mean 1 nether block equals 8 overworld blocks?
I wonder how long its been since a shower XD
Lol i actually said mesa for the second corner, i can't believe it lol
desert
There is no video yet.
You can just crack the lighters
Oh you forgot about armor trim, last episode you get 1000 sniffer, because you in 1.20.1
In Bedrock, the special area for 16,777,216 Blocks away in the overworld, you came across Special land called Stripe land, this might be difficult because you fall off for 8,600,000 Block, also bedrock edition, this can't be pass on 30,000,000 Block by tp
Bro spend 6 days finding a goddamn horse💀
Every yours videos is masterpiece Lockdown👏🤍. You are legend bro.
This reminds of another Very similar YouTube Chanel from a few months ago….
Video:living with my brother gamerz Me at the end reaction:YOU LITERALLY SAID THAT YOU LIVE WITH GAMERZ
its 8 in overworldnot 1
One time spawned right next to the border
I think the second border biome is either gonna be a jungle biome or a birch biome
I was sitting here like, "he's already made this video?!?!" and then I thought about it and it might have been Kalani... It might just be the skin confusing me lol. Great video none the less! Keep up the good work my dude
it would be nice if your brother joins your hardcore world
If you put a speed potion on a horse and then breed it it gets faster
You got the nether, overworld bps backwards.  It's one block in the nether is eight blocks in the overworld.
Imagine he forgets to put the last pearl for the last corner
Ofc the horse is black that nigg-
It seems that this video took a lot of inspiration from SB, since he found out how to slow down time from him,and also SB used a penguin banner (he is a penguin)
Still need to travel 899,999,680,000,000 blocks
Minecraft once-ler
I feel like you already did this before or maybe I'm losing it but great video lockdown life❤😂🎉
6.01 wrong 1 nether block=8 overworld blocks
1:49 that's because it's a donkey
I guess the second biome is a dessert biome   Edit: I was close
Now i wanna know if you use ender chest to carry fireworks is it refillable if someone kept putting fireworks there?
6:00 💀
Doing this all for just a bet? Jeez. Lockdown never fails to make mine, and everyone else’s day! Keep up your amazing work dude!
How did I predict you will be in badlands, ocean and forest?  Not gonna lie I really predicted it…
E
Wow great job for all the effort unbelivable  you did it in hardcore!!!!! great job lockdown  So cool how you went to all the corners ( hope GamerZ remembers to bring you back!!!) it would take me 7 days to get from bed to my door
Travel 1billion block just another video suggestion
No horses were harmed in this video
You are so good!
“What biome is it gonna be”  Me: mesa  IT WAS A MESA LESGOOOOO
Build a statue of me in the overworld
one block in the overworld are 8 blocks in the nether?
bro said 1 block in overworld = 8 blocks in nether lol
This is a lot of times spend on this video great work !
It feels like a already have seen this
Lockdownlife messed up its 8 block inthe overworld equal one block in the nether not the other way around
bro just said 1 block in over world is equal to 8 blocks in the nether but is 1 block in nether is equal to 8 bloxks in over world
lockdown life ! I have an episode if u ever think of quitting hardcore and restarting it I want you to die by going to the worlds border and bringing an ended dragon and let the dragon kill you while you’ll suffocate in the border and burning to death !
Build Netherite Factory
abc to delete gamers channel
Yay sb737 in the vid I’m his fan
Why u hate your life
You can breed a horse with speed and its permament with the baby horse
A tip for anyone trying to get a fast horse breed two that have speed 2
I literally just said to myself “lockdown life please have made a new video” and YES 4 HOURS AGO IM SO EXCITED
Wud it be cool if mini lockdownlife with netherite armr
Hi, lockdown life! I love your videos. could you search on Google for The Skindex? Then search for "sunset lockdown life this one". click on it, then click on add to wardrobe. Please check it out in game!
5:58 Bro??? Lmao
DUDE!!!!you can acctually use speed potions on horses to breed way faster horses!!!!!
I feel like Ive seen this video before, I dont know why, its weird
Only 160 hours left...That's the moment when you realize how difficult are these challenges and lockdownlife tries to entertain us doing them
I have a solution for the come back problem ...........waystone mod
i liked the vidio
Hardcore
He is use cheats how does he got zombie egg in
I watch your every video I'm biggest fan❤❤❤❤❤❤
i dont know if this is true but i saw a video from someone who applied potion effects to the horses like speed or jump boost and then he breeds them and shows that the baby horse then has that effect infinetley
I could’ve sworn i saw this exact vid a few weeks ago
actually.... one nether equal eight in the overworld
Enjoyed the video!Keep up the good work!
Bro really could have used a speed potion for the horses and breaded them, it's way faster and you can get an infinite speed horse. Lol.
Horses could only go 14 and a half per second
Hey dream
tip you can go 10 thousand blocks up the the neather roaf and set an angle in which you can go down and forward(200 degree)
Animal abuse
Hi
Animal abuse
6:02 i think 1 block in nether is equal to 8 blocks in the overworld
if you ever do such a crazy bet again, please make sure to add the preperation time needed to the overall time (at least one additional day). and if this isn´t possible, gather all the data and ressources needed in front and make your bet right after you´ve finished this task.
Why?
Fun fact: one block in the nether is 8 blocks in the overworld  Lockdown life: one block in the overworld is 8 blocks in the nether. 5:58  Learn your Minecraft facts. LOL
My guy is doing with diamond
BRO THATS SOOO COOL IS THAT A WORLD RECORD
Travel 1 billion blocks next. Just another video suggestion.
Lockdownlife said 1 block in overworld =8 in the nether
Really
6:00 what is my guy talking about
Why didn’t you use an elytra
5:58 ty for the wrong information LDL 💀👍
pov lockdownlife makes gamerz a black eye
The simsons meme  Was funny
what happens now with the next update since didnt you load chunks while doing this so if the nether gets updated again you wouldnt be able to get anything new like items and stuff and i guess same with the overworld
You can splash the horse with swiftness if u breed the baby will have swiftness even though it doesn't have the potion effect then u repeat that
you're my favorite youtuber!
Ender pearl chasis and get someone to activate it when you get to the corner
Mesa   Edit: wtf
5:57 he is crazy there
Mistake on 6.03 he said 1 over world block is 8 in the nether it's the other way round
i mA N dANGRe
this must be a world record
Tip: If you put Speed and Jump Boost potions on two horses then breed them you will get a horse that has those effects PERMANENT. So if you keep doing that you can maybe get a 100 b/sec and can jump 50 blocks up
This is the equivalent of wrapping around the earth 4 and a half times. That would be really hard to do since I would have to go outside
I love the schedule keep it up
Forest biome 0:00
Boring  💁
Travel 240 mil blocks
Another amazing video by this guy
Wait is this re upload?
5:58 💀bruuuh
He won't give up He must see the end of his world What a Madman
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Bro horse number 8 is a donkey
Did you know cats stand up when you leave
Keep up the great work lockdown
wait I saw this video a week ago
Bro sayed 1 in overworld is 8 in nether but its the other way around
Actually, 1 block in the nether is 8 blocks in the overworld.
Is this video reuploaded or someone else did uploaded similar video
Speed Potions Work on horses!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You can't open to lan without dying. This is fake hardcore video
Imagine he forgot to put banners on the corners
In 1.20 breeding is way better then searching
200,000,000!
Im not sure your meant to make another player login, Pretty sure sleeping works.
6:00 one block in the overworld=8 block in the nether😂
Haha VERY very nice
you can put speed posion on horses
Hey here's a useful tip - if you take two 14 or 15 bps horses and throw a potion of speed 2 on them then breed them before the effect wears down the baby horse would keep those speed effects if you repeat this a couple of times you could get a pretty fast horse :) could never be as fast as speed 255 but good enough to traverse millions of blocks in a fraction of the time Edit: I'm not sure if it's B.E or P.E only because minecraft keeps introducing this and removing it all the time so if you want to do this just test it in a creative world
I love your vids
BRO WHY YOU BURNING THE HORSE LET IT JUST LEAVE NOT BURN IT FOR BEING BAD
new video let goooooo, i really loved your video lockdown. Whenever im tryna have a good night, i just watchs your video every times then i have a good night. Thanks for all the works, Love you very much and keeping up the good work!
1 block in the overworld means 8 blocks in the nether no it's 1 block in the nether means 8 blocks in the overworld
instead of tons of elytras you could have just gotten phantom membranes
I guessed that the second corner was going to be a mesa biome
imagine if your brother killed you in hardcore
Yay 2HRs ago
I like the end cause he thinks he’s trapped but bro just in the restroom lol keep up the good work
That’s animal abuse
I GUSSED RANDOMLY MESA BOIME AND I GOT IT RIGHT
Horse no.8 was a donkey not a horse
When 1.21 comes round, he isnt going to be able to explore new biomes, lol
Is this a repost? I remem ber watching this video someehowe
I'm getting deja vu because I thought I watch this already
FUN FACT: i guessed mesa
can you speak german i.m from germany
6:00 . I think you‘ve swapped it 😅
my favorite part of the video was definitely when you lost the bet. The only reason why I watch your videos be abuse sandiction died and he hasn't made season 2 yet.
"1 block in the overworld = 8 blocks in the nether" -LockDownLife 2023
That wastent a horse thats a donkey
i kinda feel bad for the horses why couldent you just of freed them not kill then by making them burn to death?!?
by breeding 2 horses with speed 2 the ofspring will have speed 2 infinite
Feed the horse with wheat until u think it's enough or just feed a horse stack of wheat and tame it it will be fast trust me🎉
Amazing video LockdownLife!
I love you
" One block in the over world is eight blocks in the nether" 😭 Bruh 5:97
ok
Hapy27
Awesome
Lockdownlife is the best YouTubeer
Why did you do the bet. Because it will be hard
Bro could have used 1 elytra and a bunch of xp bottles
It was 1 hour ago
The max speed a horse can be is 14.57 blocks/second. Elytras at 0° reaches 30 b/s, with constant rocketing it's 33.5 b/s do only 3.5 blocks faster. Gliding down at 52° you can reach 67.3 b/s. To travel to the a border corner you need to go 2,651,650 blocks (nether) [21213203 overworld]. Flying at the max speed would take just under 11 hours. You'd also have to travel 2,324,813 blocks in the air to maintain the speed without hitting the ground... But traveling at the slower speed, 30 b/s, would take ≈24.5 hours...
I love this guys videos
*I love this video keep it up thank u for entertaining us❤❤❤❤*
Hi I’m just commenting for the algorithm.
Bro u could use a speed 2 potion to make the horse faster
5:58😂
Do a face reveal
you can just throw speed potions on them and the baby will be super fast like bruh
man… it’s is the third time. aren’t you getting tired?
Another amazing video😁
you know if you breed two horses who both have speed effect their offspring will be faster
5:58 1 block in nether not in overworld
That gonna take so long
5:57 1 block in the nether is 8 in the overworld
I think you should break the bedrock in the nether
Wait you have explored your entire Minecraft world  How will you get new biome in new update
Um 1 Block in overworld is 8? That’s opposite
So apparently on the nether roof it doesn't show the world borders, right? Can you travel past them in the nether? I wonder what would happen if you placed a portal in coordinates technically outside the world border
Everyone let's just appreciate all the.worl lock down life puts into theses vidieos
6:00 you save 1 block in overworld is 8 blocks un the nether
i can barely survive 5 days in minecraft hardcore
You shouldve used a speed potion on them and then bred them
5:59 isnt it sometimes 1 block in nether is equal to 8 blocks in overworld?
Dude you can throw a splash potion of speed on both horses and breed them then thier offspring will be faster 😊😊😊
Bro did the same video like 3 times
6:00 one block in the over world is 8 in the nether? Isn’t it 1 in the nether to 8 in the over world😂😂
y
💀 the end didint expected
When you explored all corners but new update come
Why did you say  1 block in the overworld equals 8 block in the nether?
you already dit tis
6:00 he said 1 block in the overworld its eight in the nether  She said the opposite
Lock down life lockdown life lockdown life you are able to use speed potions and I made some faster there and if you bring the two horses the horse stop the baby horse baby has those of pets permanently you can make a sonic speed fast horse if you listen to my comment my guy my guy
This guy just sacrifice himself for entertaining us😮 That insane ldl😂
Such an amazing vid
When face reveal?
btw you can copy banners by crafting it with another banner of the same base color
POV: your girlfriend 10:12
Why is ur brother helping u win his own bet
Yes 1 block in the overworld = 8 in the nether.
Wow yall really are fast with the views and comments lol
Lockdown never disappoints 😂
now try to travel to thr nether border
1:49 THATS A DONKEY
17:29 lmao I actually guessed a Mesa biome lol
"8 blocks in the nether is 1 in the overworld" 😭😭😭
I’m here
I just real close to unsubscribing from his channel because he killed so many horses. 1 more horse killed and i unsubscribe
You splash speed potion while they re breeding
*no horses where harmed in this video*
You are the travel guy
Kmk
6:00 sorry I couldn’t help but notice, isn’t one block in the nether equals eight in the over world?
U can breed 2 horse with speed poison and the baby one got all the effect perm.
if you want to go back to your base in a easier way :  *1- set spawn point at your home*  *2- grab with you some eyes of ender* *3- when you get to the corner , use the eyes of ender to find the portal* *4- go to the end and go back to the overworld , this is gonna get you back a the spawn point at your house* *Why no one has think about this when travelling millions of blocks ?*
Just use elytra
Yk it’s a good day when LDL uploads another Hardcore Video
It's so funny about the horse died about that lava
6:00 you said that wrong
dude , you are just getting the fastest horse , then get rid of it , because you gonna use elytra and fireworks , why ? , because you want the video to be longer.
Get ravenge on gamez
This is a world record wow
Its 1 block in the nether is 8 block in the overworld
That donkey got the rarest death message "Donkey tried to swim in lava while escaping Egg" :)
bro u wont be able to enjoy the new updates coming up now man
Wait a sec ive seen this before even with the horse speed  machine...HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
Hello
at the end: GamerZ: i will afk here so he cant get that easy back to spawn XDDDD
man just used creative in survial world
Hi
5:58 nooooo 1 block in the nether equals 8 blocks in the overworld 🧐
I go to world border without help for 9
Feeling of déjà vu... So weird
Rip
I unsubscribe
5:59 ayyyyy, wat? I think it's wrong
That is insane
So the horse went 16 blocks per second, and a minecraft block is 1 meter, so that means the horse goes 35.7 miles per hour, but if it goes 120 blocks in the nether, thats  268.4 miles per hour
Umm lockdownlife? You said it was in hardcore but for the zombie farm you used creative and eggs💀
Bruh u made me laugh
Damn
this is not how u get fast horses
hey lockdown life i think you kinda mixed up the over world and the nether   1 block in the nether= 8 blocks in the overworld its at 5:57
You can duplicate banners with a banner of its kind example: white banner that is dyed put it in crafting with a normal white banner it gets duplicated
One of the horse  Is a dongki
The end was 😂😂😂😂 insane and 😂😂😂😂 funny 😂😂😂😂😂
You have said it wrong (5:59): one block in the NETHER in 8 blocks in the OVERWORLD
You can make the horse faster with taming and speed 3 poition
Hi lockdown
Is this a reupload video??
sheesh good achievement
200,000,000 Blocks 😭
Ah yes another classic LockDownLife video
Lock down you now you can splash speed potion to horse
hi
I love you
Lol a repost
But what are you gonna do if 1.21 comes out? every shunk is already loaded
❤
nice
Man in just half a year, you got 1000x better! Mad respect!
How long did it take you
Don’t u need to sleep?
You are crazy 😂😅
Not complaining, but in 5:58 you are wrong, you said one block in the overworld equals 8 blocks in the nether, but its literally the opposite
I could spend my whole life and not be able to do this.
200 million blocks traversed? In Minecraft Hardcore? I can barely make it across the room without tripping over something!
This guy doesn't like new chunks Also I didn't know gamerz was ur bro I thought he was ur friend lol
im finally early to a lockdownlife video
6:00 1 block in the nether=8 blocks in the overworld u said 1 in overworld= 8 in the nether (don't mean anything just to correct what u said)
Early 14 minutes after posted
6:00 you said it wrong! its the opposite
1 block in overworld = 8 blocks in nether? huhhhhhhhh
5:35 It's possible to copy banners in a crafting table
Its funny how lockdownlife makes videos of traveling to the world borders and he uses elytra + firework but in the next episode he uses horses before fireworks
Claim your within an hour ticket here
I love your vids!!!
amazing video! but i have a question  rather than being teleported back to the chunk loader by gamerZ when you reached every corner couldnt you have just gone back in the portal to the roof and continue there itself to the next corner?
he said”  one block in the over world equals eight blocks in the nether, while it should be eight blocks in the over world equals 1 block in the nether😂😂
1:53 that guy was a donkey...
5:59  wrong way lockdown
😅,,mm,m😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
If you put speed potion and jump boost to the horse and breed the new hors had a perm speed and jump boost
LDL (LockDownLife) what happened after you ended the video when you said NNNOOoooo!!!!! and your'e the best youtuber EVER
you can give the horse speed splash portion to 2 horse's and breed them then u will get a faster horser
I love your vids! Its my first time being THIS early!!!!!
Whai joe ar nat joe wult niewen updet
Sp0oddy was here.
Wait I think it’s 1 nether block = 8 in overworld
15 block per second horse with speed potion has left the chat crying
I feel like i watched this before.....
Whats your game size now 🧐
Lockdown life can you make a video about you fighting the warden?
He said one block in the overworld = 8 blocks in the nether it’s 1 block in the nether is 8 blocks in the overworld otherwise it would be longer
The quality of these videos just gets better and better - he’s grown a lot as a youtuber that’s for sure
.
I bet that no one will like this comment because nobody will do it
It’s always a good day when LockDownLife uploads keep up the good work
So this is his second channel or first?
5:58 No, one block in the NETHER is 8 blocks in the OVERWORLD
THIS IS INSANE like the amount of effort to put in insane
The ending is funny, idk why but it is.😂
I think this replod
u said sb i love u sb is my favreit
Why not just use elytrah since the beginning
Im your horse iiiieeeee
Amazing dude
I saw this video
Did anyone noties he said 1 block in overworld 8 in nether

I wonder what you did with the 13 blocks per second horse when  you traveled to the world border
It was fast both
Stop killing horses you and your skin is weird the skin you are using was made before Minecraft was even made
Next i mine entire overworld to create better image of upgraded overworld
1 block in the nether is 8 blocks in the overworld
Bro u could use speed potion and breed two speed horses. Then the baby horse would be fast permanently.
RLY NICE VIDEO DUDE
I got a 15 heart horse 2 times
