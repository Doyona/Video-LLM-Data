Eggsplosive
Eddie is loosing it big time 😂
It all makes sense now Conor Trenn.. all makes sense.
This makes you feel sick to the stomach, fight avenesyan, kelly jokers its gets worse day by day.
Wise words
Amir Khan? 'chortle chortle'
Conor Benn will bang out most of the TOP 10 in the world! And Kel Brook and khan wont last 4 rounds! facts!
lol
Kahn, did I just hear that right. He was never a good boxer and this lad might put him beyond the help of even our best ITU. Come on, skip Kahn for his sake and pick someone who might last beyond 10....seconds.
Come on man. This guy he's fighting bums. Give him a reall opponent. Why are you talking about Khan. Why doesn't he call out David avenesian or marku. Couse you know he will get KO.. There are plenty off good boxers domestically. Conor Ben needs to learn how to walk before he can run.
Eddie knows Benn wants to jump the gun, but Eddie is a business man wants him step up slowly and make him great in time, rather then slip up early in his career. Take your time Man. 😁
Benn 2.0, a boxer so contradictory he has a beard transplant by choice and then fights shaven by choice, the kid's got balls but he's low on brains for certain.
No drawing power
lol. Slippery Eddie.
Can really see the difference since being with sims, style like AJ, ruthless, no respect, come forward inside fight style like AJ when he first turned pro
Connor needs to calm down  Erroll spence and terrence Crawford  Are world class boxers they won't be easy like vargas he get taught a boxing lesson
Great guy, he loves his dad and his dad loves him, amazing story. All the best Conor.
Woau
Benn wants to jump to the top but it's a bit too early. Eddie wanted to say hold on kid not so fast I've seen this before the knockout came too soon to see what you got in the way of being under pressure.   So he will put together the 2 fights this year both will be British and European level just below the top guys. It's the smart move it's steady Eddie way milk the PUNTERS. like he did with AJ. All the while talking him up. All the same I'd like him to fight amir Khan next and see what he got against someone who won't take him lightly
I find it hard to dislike Eddie, he's always honest and I love the way Nigel Benn has took a back seat and doesn't steal the limelight like another boxer and son I could mention.
Watch Conner's face change when Eddie says you might chin me 😂😂 if looks could kill Eddie be died by now 🤣
Even when Eddie was complementing him he said I ain't the best and because of his personality he will emulate carl froch I believe
Amir Khan said he needs to win some titles first, and he's right
I didn't see a KO
Benn would end khans career
His Dad was lethal and he seems cut straight from the same cloth. Look forward to him becoming a world champ.
Would love to see josh Kelly vs ben
Nonsense, fight stopped early, looking with rose tinted glasses. Two sons of legends just gassing to get out of there fathers shadow.
Eddie Hearn is a plague on boxing!!! the biggest heavyweight fight this county has ever seen will be in Saudi. Calls them his fighters when in reality they are his cash cows
100% on the PEDs
Why call out a man that's way past his best want a name fight a big name in current fighting circles not as he said reality TV circles
Khan doesn't need it  bow out please. Too young and hungry. We all get old
Screw face
Give me a proper test ....give me Kahn 🤦🏻‍♂️ he’s way past it ffs
Bread and circus for the masses while your overlords destroy your lives. And most of you are too stupid to see it.
Nigel Benn Legend😀Conner Benn Legend🥊🥊🥊
4:01 shades of De Niro in Goodfellas. Gangsta !
conor is looking a beast
I’m so glad Nigel benn as a son with the same hunger and determination hands up to Conner 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
@1:37
Eddie sucking up as always
Conor looking at Eddie like a pure killer
Lol all hype go fight jarron ennis
Impressed by Benns performance there. Don't think he's quite ready for the big dogs of this division yet but he's definitely on that path. Exciting future.
Khan wouldnt last at all with conor, Conor  hes a new breed a street fighter
Eubank Benn???
Amir on way out
Conor Benn vs Michael mckinson the problem who is undefeated
Terrible stoppage. Not even a standing 8 count in first round. Matchroom taking piss now with the refs and judges.
Get shot of your promoter's , get dad to do it at least he's honest.
Is Conor deliberately trying to pull the same scowl that his father did or is that just genetic? LOL.
Eddie on the charlie sheen ...Chewing ears off lol
These promoters are so patently obvious at waffling, and Hearn is just the same.
‘Promotes are glorified cheerleaders- Mike Tyson
Cant wait to see another Benn take a seat lol
Amir Khan would get put to sleep.
Amir was finished years ago
khan will not fight him. 100% will not.
What is going on with that look! Does he wanna kill Eddie?
Why is benn so angry🤣
Class 👌🏻
Eyyyy amazing performance. Love the attitude and confidence. Also from Eddie like talking to Ben and bigging him up on sky sports Live is awesome to see. Shows he cares about his fighters ya know? Can wait to see what's next for Ben
Weird one as I agree if he lands Khan is gone, but Connor isn’t Canelo and he isn’t Crawford. I think Khan could walk him into a flurry that would put this lad on his arse.
Benn would ko Khan in two rounds.Irrelevant.Benn should go for European welterweight title next a step up against David Avaneysaun.
2:20 - The death stare after Hearn’s comment about doubting him is meme-tastic 🤣🤣
theres some real dangerous operaters at welterweight at the moment, i ain't saying duck fighters, but choose wisely who you gonna fight next, Marku or Mckinson would be a competetive test.
If I can get evens money for Conor to beat Amir khan, I will put 500 quit on it
He’ll be calling Ricky Hatton and  junior witter next he’s too arrogant n cocky he’s in for a big fall
Some powerful shots there. Khan can't take shots like that.
Ben jr  vs Eubank jr would be crazy
Great words of respect from Hearn there at the end. Classy.
Looks like Conor wants to eat Hearn and all his challengers lol
Someone please tell the Eubanks everything Eddie has just said!!!! Benn looks good... don’t rush him tho I agree
You have to give it to Eddie...
David Avenesian is like   👋🏼
Reminds me of Gabriel rosado
Thank the Lord for social distancing with Conor eyeing Eddie like that.🤣🤣🤣
Connor Ben is the future,his old man was hard as nails,u can see that in Connor,that would b a great battle vrs khan,I think Connor would get the victory🥊🥊🥊
Why no mention of kell brook
Conner will eat khan.   Let's get serious
Is there any boxer Eddie hearn hasn't got under his belt 🤣😂
Haha connor...why did u scare Eddie like that. The way Eddie's narrative switched when connor called him out...I thought it was a different interview lol. Eddie was shook. Connor wanted those 11 more rounds lol.
Why ask for Amir why dont you ask the Albanian guy Marku ask him and show us how fast you can??????
Can’t see it happening, no way Khan wants anyone that can fight
Conor's speed and power was phenomenal , Reminded me when i first saw Mike Tyson in the mid eighties fighting.
Look Vargas is battle worn. He can look good 1 minute and terrible the next. This is no real test. Put Connor Benn in with Florian Marku..that will tell us where he is really at. Eddie could promote a blind man with 2 left feet let's no forget that. Put Connor in with Kell Brook or Khan.
The gift of the gabs got Eddie Hearn
Eddie Hearn in his glory ££ signs in his eyes
Eddie hearn would give anyone a chubby lip service at its best
I dunno I'm on the fence with Connor he's need to fight someone with  a bit more creditability.....
Eddy Is it a jump tho?
That’s how you woffel ladies
Why do Benn still have his gloves on?
Fair play to Eddie... he tells it like it is, even with Conor staring at him like a man possessed. Khan would be easy to sell, but not sure if it proves anything... Conor has put in the work though, you can see that. And actually I like his hunger and I like that aggression...
1 punch i will take him out.
loving eddies new set of brass balls, hes been giving it large all week.. next stop, a part in a guy ritchie movie :)
I think Florian Marku will beat Connoer Benn ...
Best promoter in world bar none
Khan will beat him
He did well but let's not get carried away.he beat a washed up fighter in vargas.
He wants to absolutely destroy Eddie's jaw hahaha then realises he earns his purse
Congratulations to Connor Benn, he's really going places
Eddie can sell Sand to Arabs.
Amir khan was a Olympic silver medalist at 17 years and a world champion at conors age and way faster then conorin hes peak, made a name in America never backed off a fight but unfortunately Connor for khan is high risk low reward .connar needs to stop ducking marku who is shouting out every were for conor
Great win and very tidy, clean performance. Conor looking like the most improved fighter in the UK over the last year. Let's not get ahead of ourselves though. Vargas although decent was just a gate keeper. 4 loses in his last 6 it's safe to say it wasn't the step up to really test Conor. He'll blast khan, brook etc but only because they're done. Hes in a naughty weight class where easy fights don't exist at the highest level. Needs to take a couple of fights and spend some time in the US imo. I think it would do him the world of good like his old man.
That was not an early stoppage
Hype job
He's got potential not sure if he could beat Crawford though
Absolutely superb Connor Benn,Will be top of the tree in a few years,Savage
Khan hands speed will be to much for nigel son
Definitely entertaining. He'll make some good money. If he bangs one of the welterweight big 6 he'll be a proper world class fighter. But right now I can't see any of the top welterweights not being able to handle the aggression
Did any one else cringe at this 🙈🙈
Bomber benn
Florian marku would put u in a spliff
Conor benn don’t want to call out Vergil Ortiz or jaron Ennis but old past prime Khan 😂😂😂😂
The boy 💥👏👏is ready for next champ, who is next mate? I love his confendce, let's go Benn💪
Billy Joe vs Benn..............
Eddie is full of it - changed his tune when Conor said he couldn’t step up 😂😂
I just hope Eddie takes it steady with Benn and steps him up gradually and doesnt do anything insane like when he threw Brook in with Golovkin. Give Benn 2 or 3 fights at top 10 level then he will be ready for the world title fights.
Florian marku... waiting for you, scary boy!
Connor gonny be a monster
Think ref had a Chinese being delivered how quick he stopped the fight
First time in years watching a young fighter makes me want to watch a next fight , he going all the way for sure the way he speaks , and 1st round finish in boxing is unheard of now
I don’t like his attitude
Hearn didn't understand that line about talent at all
Amir Khan is a pussy
Boxing is over
I’m a Khan fan I’m sorry he would be destroyed by those punches
Conner, please leave the old men alone. There's no credit in fighting old men. i.e. Khan  !
Stay tf away form Shawn porter 🙏🏿
Kahn don’t want any of that thunder
Well done Connor lookin forward to following the rest of his career
Amir Khan wont want any of this.
Marku to ko benn
Standing  6'' apart you tools I don't want to catch a cold
wow i was routing for Connor ben until i see how ego and arrogant he is wow  his dad was a legend but boy oh boy
Fight AB former 3 weight world champion, and beatable then retire Khan. Lad will go all the way to the top.
Definitely, a massive improvement, under Tony Simms you can see the lad as received a true boxing education with the word educate meaning in the etymology 'to draw out.' Tony is drawing out his latent boxing ability, his punching harder, faster and with accuracy and his shots are varied, he throws good straight hands and excellent hooks and uppercuts. He can become a world champion and he would swarm all over Khan and would stop him inside 7 rounds. His work rate reminds me of Ivor the engine Jones who boxed as a pro the same time I did back in the early 80s!
Respect to both men
Benn looks like he going to knockout hearn in that interview
Sometimes eddy talks waffle , their is no way that a boxer who is trying to get out of the dad's shadow could be just as hungry as someone who started with nothing , I know why he said it but I do think it's wrong
Eddie's ( Vince McMahon ) Hearn is getting good at this 😂
Glass jaw will go down
British ranked fighters that would beat connor benn -  Chris Kongo Micheal McKinton  Samual Antwi Ekow Essmun
chill out kid you sound and look miserable
Just like his old man privileged to witness this.
He sticks it on Eddie brilliant
Nobody likes Khan. He's a materialistic show off, out of touch with the people especially his own community. His own people would tune in to watch him get knocked out.
Crazy you Britts  will probably support  this bs but I guess as an American I can't  judge.
Josh Kelly sat at home thinking 'oh so that's what I should be doing' .........
When Eddie is older he can easily go into politics, the geezer can Chat
Massive improvement, was genuinely hoping he'd come through but didn't wanna get too excited 🤣 Props 👍
Pls put Marku v Connor pls pls pls
Vargas had no movement, and no power in exchanges but Congratulations to Connor he looked sharp
Marku is here
Eddie puts the best fights together and seems is genuine
It's CONOR BENN ff sake every other comment spelling the lads name wrong it's in the title of the video ?????
Forget khan fight canelo. Somebody needs to knock out canelo
please...Benn would iron out Khan in one round, let Benn shut Marku up.
Has the vicious streak like his dad with a jab added to the arsenal that his dad never had. Not saying he’s better than his father, only time will tell, but he really has changed and is far more polished now. He was so accurate in this fight it was very impressive 🥊
Eddie the life coach
Benn would beat Khan
At the end I feel like I'm intruding on a personal pep talk...
If Benn ever hits top level he will be a promoters nightmare with outlandish demands and so on just wait and see. Eddie said Eubank Jr was the hardest fighter to deal with but that will be a walk in the park compared to this.
Amir shouldn't be fightin anyone but Brook!  Chatted sh*t so long and he's not a force against young guns.  Benn will bang him like a Salvation Army Drum. Apart from a shared opponent, Benn gains nothin from that fight!
Brutally
Kahn or Brook couldn't live with Benn in this form, his dad told him to walk through Vargas and he he did just that, shades of his dad right there, nobody with anything to lose will want to fight him.
Khan won't fight him.
Fight Florian marku
That boy and broner mas be a good match up🤔
Fight Vergil Ortiz
Amir's Khan is a bum. Benn will retire him!
Florian Marku will KO him in 4 rounds 100% sure.
I respect Eddie's experienced and honest words there and isnt it very interesting seeing some boxers in modern times coming from the unconventional background where they are supposed to not have the hunger to become greats in the ring as some could certainly be on their way to be decent champions.  Boxing has so much to give us.
He really is a problem for any of the welterweight and he's only a baby in the game. Love his story, where he's come from, who is is, his desire and dedication  he's a family man and a monster at the same time
Awkward toward the end there
Knocked out Vargas in 82 seconds. Would knock out Khan in 28 seconds.
Khan would be a pure money fight Ben would stop him in three rounds , to be fair most fighters would stop Khan these days ,, stay away from Brook he would be far too dangerous at this stage !! Very impressive performance all the same
Eddie. Chill out a bit
The amount of disrespect Khan gets is so unfair. Everyone still salty he didn’t fight brook because he wanted to be x3 world champ agonist a p4p top 5 in Crawford. More brits should be like Khan. To be fair that’s what I see in Conor
Amir Khan is a walk over for benn give him someone with a chin let him prove him self which he will no doubt
Florian Marku next???
Eddie just knows what to say everytime😂
Needs to calm down, don't be a broner
I like Connor benn, he defo needs to stay humble thought please don’t go down the arrogant path, he will probably loose  50% of support,  look at Hatton and Bruno there was a reason these 2 fighters were the best supported fighters ever to come out of Britain
His a cokey mouthy mug ! Lost all respect for this melt  now !
So he beat a journey man in 1 round... woop de doo. Too much hype in boxing nowadays. Let's see him against Avanesyan
He just needs to calm down going at 100mph is not good Eddie is good at calming boxer's down he'll beat Khan 100%?????
Benns come on a lot, great work lad
Eye of  the tiger man eye of the tiger
I honestly find all these boring unless he’s fighting Florian Marku something exciting
Get him khan  and ben yer u hve to fight agen this year
Khan will knock him out... for sure..
I told my son’s Conner Benn is going to win this, super fit strong and a determination to Win, Well done Conner !!
Khan wont want that..at all
Eddie so excited he’s just found his next cash cow lol....
That’s how to make a statement. Same treatment awaits Khan...then onto Broner and to mop up everyone else. I think he’s a better all-round fighter than Nigel and I get why Conor perhaps feels a bit frustrated but he’s not being arrogant...he’s being supremely confident and he has every right to believe in himself. World stage awaits. Boxing needs characters who can walk the talk. Keep up the great work Conor your doing the family name proud.
Conor seems to have a real attitude, not sure if it’s a good thing or if he’s going to become overwhelmed and have a chip on his shoulder . I hope he can use it for good.
How can you not fight for the British??
Amir kahns a bum fight fight that mexican that stopped Warrington dunno about weights like
first time ive ever thought eddies been quite harsh, still gave him props but i feel he deserves massive props for that performance, eddie should of backed up his fighters words this time, conor smashed that interview and it seemed eddie shot him down! bad form this time eddie boy
Hearn im not being disrespectful to conner, you forget hes his own person this lads going far the only bad habit he has is stepping back with his hands down
I’d like to see Benn V Ennis both great prospects! Exceptional job Benn 👌🏿
Benn vs khan makes no sense Khan is washed up.
Amir Khan will never take this fight
The moment you realise you've been a bit too honest (possibly brutally honest 😉) and your gonna get chinned at the end of the interview: @2:10.  Then the moment you turn it all around: @4:40  Great comeback from Eddie. Turned it around, sign of a true great.
hed smash khan into next week
Connor looking at Eddie like akuma 😂
Eddie Hearn could sell ice to an Eskimo
The destruction of Josh Kelly’s career forgotten already judging by the comments.
Great performance. Really love the benns the family the morals. He is Connor benn not just nigel sons who can box.
Conor you have the talent , Talent comes in many ways , Just stay in your lane and keep focused .
Billion to the trout let's have it
The guy who has nothing and has to fight his way out is always far dangerous. Stfu Eddie, you two little rich boys ain’t got a clue. Conor will get sparked soon enough.
Eddie could sell presents to Father Christmas.
❣️
❣️
Lol connors a nutter.
Connor  Ben udank Sun full arina
Apple don’t fall far the tree, his Ol man was vicious and Conors got that too. Looking forward to following his career
Did anyone else start crying at Eddie's last bit? Maan that was emotional. "YOu  are a great fighter"
Love Conner benn
Eddie is trying to calm him down, not jump to big fights.. long term money over quick money.. each fight is an extra payday for all
Cant Lie Conner s onto big things. The boy can fight and box.
Still got that buzz off his win
Puppets these fighters are for promoters. No wonder eubanks is glued to his sons hip 24/7.
It’s great to see people speak so highly of Eddie Hearn, I’m fed up of people having a go at him and Booing him He is a top promoter and a great guy
Have to agree with the majority of comments and Eddie that Khan isn't really an opponent. Eddie believes after seeing that performance, Conor is really for world class opponents.   When this post fight gets beamed around the globe, the boxing community will speak the name Conor and go WOW, What an improved performance.
I have alot of time for Eddie 👍
I hope Connor stays with Tony Sims & doesn't get palmed off to McCraken like AJ did. Great talent & a future watcher. Not sure about how far he'll go.
He's improved so much, still needs a few more fights before world level
Great fighter but what a great promoter
Wow, what a fight. Not seen a proformance like that in a while. He really needs to work on his media game if he wants to go all the way. Considering the family he's from I'd thought this would be on point. He's a raw as they come.
I think Eddy Hearn was truly scared in that post fight interview. 🤣🤣🤣
In dhe moments only boxing  rabbit 🐇 🐇🐇🐇
i legit thought Amir Khan had retired.
He put his family first , well done young man your going to the top
Hearn moves straight in for the MASSIVE PPV against the unranked Khan and Benn's having none of it LOL
I don’t know Eddie, but he seems to be quite funny and likeable
I think Conor Benn should fight David Avanesyan since he beat Josh Kelly and Amir Khan finally finds his balls and fights Kell Brook and the winners of both fights fight each other before Christmas I hope it’s Brook v Benn and if Benn wins both fights then Eddie should make Conor Benns first fight in 2022 a world title fight
Why the hell they mentioning Amir Khan like he isn't an old pensioner? So many other fights in and around their prime. Amir Khan's prime was over 10 years ago!
Khan, Brook are done, washed up. Shawn porter, avenesan, might be abit too much for benn, Adrian broner is a good 50/50 fight. props on the win, though it was premature
Eddie should be doing changing room motivation talks before flights! That was impressive!
Eddie giving some sweet advice and Conner you definitely got the talent 👏🏾👊🏾👊🏾😎
Thing that he has  and he's said it before is he don't have to box for a living he's got the money his dad sorted him, but he's doing it because he wants to be the best he wants to be champion,  I wish him all the best
Love it, real!!!
It wasn't a KO its was a TKO
Conor needs a few wars in the trenches  to really see if hes got his Fathers fighting blood only then will we be able to call it  ?   Its easy to look good against a slow washed up fighter like he faced here  !   Conor should be fighting for a world title now hes 24 and time is ticking hes in his prime for the next 5-6 years so Eddie needs to get on the case pronto   ?
That was absolutely disgusting!!!!
Eddie Hearn is the Best Boxing Promoter and Sales Executive in the World!! He gets deals done and his Fighters Paid!! Respect 🙌🏾
Be careful what names you wish for shawn porter will school you
Go for billy joe next , he would smack your arse just Kahn , you cocky nobhead
Conor boxed razor sharp. He is a top fighter.  Amir khan would be flattened the speed is to much
Getting cocky Connor !! Liked you at first now your a nob , and Amir is well old
Connor don’t listen to Eddie because that’s the downhill right there.. Any boxer who listens to nice creamy words is a boxer no more..
Eddie needs to chill 😹
Khan would ruin Ben
I dont like him. Proper thug, and i mean that in the bad sense.
People want to no why eddie is the man... just watch this!!
Forget Amir Khan fight the domestic fighters win the British title then European title then world scene Conor beating Amir Khan doesn’t prove anything really you need to be king of your own back yard mate
Eddie honestly believes his own bullshit
i like the look of this Conor benns, he looks decent
Fair enough for  Connor Benn he wants to play hard with the big boys and see how much of a different one we have in our benns well if Eddie dought then sure Frank Warren ave him as he did with his dad got balls and the confidence as he got it big time and see look at Connor not happy here nigel Benn and doing right things to show he's good as his dad no shadow then beats best there there's ur answer hope he does amir k back to Bolton
he gotta see virgil ortiz
Close fight.
Eddie just demonstrating his man management style and the rest of us thinking is that all it takes?!
I never seen such a brilliant British welter weight fighter so far ... only heavy weight division is dominated by British boxers but after this fight big fan of Conor Benn.. He is another version of vergil Ortiz jr.... let him a title shot against the name he mentioned specially Amir Khan
Konor looKing at Eddie liKe he wa$ food
If he wants to prove he is elite level he should fight for the British tittle rather than Amir Khan.
Awkward, Eddie. Shush for a minute. The mentoring chat was poor. Nobody wants their inadequacies discussed live on Sky. Cmon
Amir khan can't take this fight for the money, let's be real if Vargas put him on his arse few years back I can only imagine he be going home in an ambulance if he fights Benn
Class keep him busy
Amen
Best of luck brother
Bet Nigel’s buzzing
Got proper character too
This mons ppv
Go down. He will put khan to sleep
Folds khan all day
Calling out Shawn porter ? Does he want to get sparked out
Conor Benn vs Eubank Jr in 3years, imagine the build up to that fight
Listen to Eddie calling Conor Benn a great fighter.  L O L
Faryal Makhdoom rimmed me.
Why Kahn ? guy hasn’t had a fight since 2019
The only thing he proved in this fight is the ref decision was ver premature if this was accross the pond i recon vargas would have held him up later rounds
Not a prospect anymore..a contender period..potential world champ....
Wow he’s good but get real, khan has the most champions fought on his record in comparison to any British fighter out there rn. Khan don’t need to prove anything. Easy for you casuals to show disrespect since he ain’t the same fighter.
It's a jump for Khan not Ben!
Connor has proved he can av it reckons he will smash AB
Only Eddie Hearn can make it sound like Amir Khan is still in his prime 😂😂
Connor is one scary ass dude
I think David Avanesyan is a good fight . To solidify entry in to fighting a top 10 world level fighter .
Hearn giving him the ego trip..fair play conor .
You're conners dad hahaha are you serious
Let the golden boy fight next garcia
Eddie is a faking legend mate
CONOR BENN VS EDIJIJUS KAVALIUSKAS IS ONE OF THE BEST RIVAL ON BENN TO TEST HER POWER IF HE WANT TO FIGHT KAVALIUSKAS BECAUSE KAVALIUSKAS IS ONE OF THE CLASS B FIGHTER THAT NOT EASY OPPONENT KAVALIUSKAS IS HAVING HARD PUNCH THAT WAY TO DEFEAT HER OPPONENT
Son of a legend on the way up! Tim Tszyu, Australia. Son of legend Kyosta Tszyu. 17-0.
BUT HE FIRST TO FIGHT AS PREPARATION AS TUNE UP FIGHT FOR CONOR BENN EDIJIJUS KAVALIUSKAS KAVALIUSKAS IS NOT EASY OPPONENT HE ARE HAVING ONE PUNCH HARD TO GIVES DIFFICULT FIGHT TO CONOR BENN IF HE FIGHT KAVALIUSKAS HE NEED PREPARE   FOR KAVALIUSKAS FIGHT
CONOR BENN NEEDS TO PREPARE NEXT AND BE READY TO FIGHT THE BIGGEST NAME IN WELTERWEIGHT LIKE VIRGIL ORTIZ JARON ENNIS JAMAAL JAMES KEITH THURMAN SHAWN PORTER ERROL SPENCE TERENCE CRAWFORD ETC LETS BE READY TO FIGHT THEM FOR GOT BECOMES BIG NAME IN WELTERWEIGHT DIVISION LETS GO CONOR BENN
Why is it titled a KO when it was a TKO 🤔
Amir Kahn lol
Let Conor Benn beat up the albanian bum marku.
He must be working very hard in the gym because he's really looking great i watch all his father fights on his way up and this young man is better than his dad as a boxer and he can fight like his dad and he seems to have the same mindset as his father too he's the real deal no doubt about that.
Gota be taken very seriously now very ambitious hel take on anyone
Amir will never take this fight..
Yer can't not like Eddie
Brilliant performance .....sharp and accurate with power. He deserves all the accolades , onwards and upwards Conor.👍🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
That was the best finish I've seen for years ...... combo after combo  vargases head rocked back hars   at least half a dozen times...   a step up in class fight  😂😂😂 me thinks he is ready for the big boys
I have a feeling that Mr Fox Rupert Murdoch will order the final fight between Luke Fury and Deontay Wilderbeast and overule mr 32 degree Edwardo Hearn and get the final run out of his Bugatti Veyron AKA RUN AT A LOSS PROMOTION deontay MILLENIAL wilder.
LOL Eddie twice his size and can box he would slap the head of benn lol
I think  we need  English lessons in England mr hearn, or was your lies spilling out? talent  & Skilled i think  hes confusing. &  connor shut up thats why hes taking 20% of Your  purse let him promote u idiot  hard headed
Why does he look at Eddie like this, too funny 😂😂😂
lol Benn turned into a monster with that Mike Tyson look
Respect to Eddie , his words were real
Class  your going all the way total dedication.
He would do well listening to Eddie, In fact it was quite touching towards the end there. Shock the World Benn, 5 more fights the way he is going. Who knows ?
Wowww! Very impressive performance by Conor. I still think they should take there time with Conor, keep moving him up slowly. There's no rush.
Sounds like Conner is on something so angry ???
Connor benn is a serious problem for any welterweight and Eddie hearn is the best promoter in the world hands down, point blank and period.
Amen 🙏🏻
reminds me of Tyson. not the style, the killer attitude.
Amih is not top 15. Amia won't even fight kell brook
Great performance but joke stoppage. I dont mind early stoppages but the guy wasnt badly hurt and had his hands up was trying to bob on ropes. He desrved more respect. If they stopped all fights like this there would be no point total scam
Eddie is such a salesman
Of course khan will lose now because he past his prime and Conor is at peak and young but prime khan would of destroyed this guy khan been in with killers even tho he lost but he got heart he'll put masterclass performance against Conor 💯💯💯
I hope he fights Khan just so I can see Khan do the silly dance again like against Prescott lol
FLORIAN MARKU 🇦🇱👑
Connor thinks he is further along than Eddie thinks, I think in 4 fights time he will be fighting for the title and I think he leaves matchroom as he didn't look impressed with what Eddie was saying
Absolutely trashed to call out Avanesyan wants a well passed it semi retired Amir Khan 😂
Khan hasn't fought in almost 2 years. Hes semi retired. Benn will most likely be semi retired aswell after 30 odd fights and be called out by another young prospect. Thus, the cycle continues.
Not convinced by benn at all no way was vargas fit lol khan will outbox benn.
Nobody speaks like Eddie of his fighters...that’s why the fighters love this man....he’s the best promoter on the planet by a country mile....🥊💥❤️
Animal
Khan wont fight Benn
Khan is washed up benn beating him proves nothing
Great performance, and a big fan. But I thought talent meant natural/gift/god given 😂😂😂😂. Eddie with his weird praise/compliments, conor still needs a real 5 fight  run at welter before belts.
Ain’t this Vargas fella some old washed up fighter that’s been beat by most
When khan watched this fight he got flashbacks from the Prescott fight
I'd love to see another Benn vs eubank!
Give Connor ben the Sean porters and Spencer’s
the ending was AMEN. done
Awesome performance,, easy a world class fighter. Would be great to see him beat up Eubank Jr just to finally get shut of the blag merchant.
I think Eddie had to change his pants after that interview, thank god for social distancing lol
Amir Khan  or Porter would be very good The trouble is Benn has learnt nothing from this fight Great stoppage but learnt nothing
Conor one of them wild mix race guys
Khan is way past prime he looked like crap against Billy Dibbs Conor beats him easily. Conor Benn should stay away from Brook. Kell beats Benn.
Eddie can talk haha
Vargas had TWO wins in his LAST SIX fights and was coming in to this off the back of a KO also... Benn is developing well, but for ONCE can we not create an aura around a young fighter that is completely unjustified at this point. There is a VERY good chance Benn gets iced when he steps up against A CURRENT ACTIVE ELITE fighter.
Haha he apologises for scaring Eddie and then proceeds to give him the scariest look I’ve ever seen 😂
Amen
Brook and khan would never beat this boy even together. benn dismantled a real rough durable guy
Conor looked great. All the hard work paying off 🙏
Fight danny garcia or avenisiyan he beat josh who you wanted to fight but dont see you calling him cause you know you  will be getting banged out.
this is such a motivational moment
And why on earth should Khan fight Conor Benn
Fight someone that has power and throw punches...you no its a fix when the opponent throws nothing
Eddie is one hell of a promoter
im so happy not to hear the team say Lions in the Den
Connor has got the kill in his eyes wow 👏
Eddie should be a lawyer. Hed talk a murderer out of a crown court anyday.
The most improved fighter in last 2 years. Really has impressed me the way he's improved
The Khan fight makes no sense for Amir. Not enough cash involved in taking another potential hard knockout. And Benns style is a nightmare for Amir, a fighter who's incredibly dangerous early.
Conor is a great talent, but right now I think Khan may be too slick, too experienced for him. Give him a few more first, he did great work tonight, but needs more experience than 1 round at this level before stepping up
Benn is scary man 😅
he should be on fury/aj undercard
Amir Khan isn’t a test he should have retired already
He would spark Khan inside 3 rounds. Not even being disrespectful to Khan here but he’s washed up as it is he shouldn’t be fighting young punchers with a point to prove.
There's plenty other fighters than amir
Khan will not be picking up the phone anytime soon
Khan's past it. Conor should look for a sterner challenge
kahns got no chance !!!!!!
tattooed penis
Not a chance in hell that Khan will fight Benn. He avoided Brook for years as Brook didn't have a big enough reputation to take the chance of losing to him. No way he'll bow out to Benn.
Marku next has to be who else agrees
Who is Josh Kelly ?
Eddie is a great promoter.
This team. This love. This respect. There going all the way 👊
I'd love to see him smash Broner into retirement!
🥊🥊🥊💨
Knocks out khan and brook would like to see him with broner and marku.
AVANESYAN - 🐔🐔🐔
Conor benn v Florian Marku. Make the fight!
